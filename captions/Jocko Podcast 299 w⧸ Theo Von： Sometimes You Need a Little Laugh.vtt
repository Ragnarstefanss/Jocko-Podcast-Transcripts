00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.02
This is Jockel podcast number 299 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink good evening. I come good evening

2
00:00:09.22 --> 00:00:11.22
So there is a video

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.08
And it's it's out there in the world on YouTube or whatever you can find it and it's it's a video of the Battle of Ramadi

4
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:28.76
2006 in the summertime and there's this big firefight going on and

5
00:00:30.56 --> 00:00:35.44
You can tell it's pretty intense. There's machine gun fire a bunch of people

6
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:41.20
Putting rounds down range people are yelling and barking out orders and passing information

7
00:00:41.20 --> 00:00:47.52
And you can kind of put together that they're working to get a bomb dropped from air support on

8
00:00:47.52 --> 00:00:54.20
On a vehicle that the insurgents had been utilizing and fighting from and

9
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:00.36
They they get the bomb run and

10
00:01:00.98 --> 00:01:06.06
Right as the right as the bomb is about to hit there's a low in the gunfire because guys are taking cover

11
00:01:06.78 --> 00:01:09.02
You know as that bomb is gonna hit and

12
00:01:09.02 --> 00:01:15.46
And then so there's a low in the fire and then the bomb hits

13
00:01:17.46 --> 00:01:20.62
And there is a massive explosion and

14
00:01:21.50 --> 00:01:24.34
You hear a lack of couple hoots and then you hear this

15
00:01:25.70 --> 00:01:28.30
You hear this bellowing laughter

16
00:01:28.98 --> 00:01:36.02
From one person and you can tell the laughter sort of it's some surprise it's some excitement

17
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:42.50
It's some level of relief and some it's also just some twisted dark military humor

18
00:01:44.18 --> 00:01:46.18
That's making this person

19
00:01:47.02 --> 00:01:49.66
Bellow out with this laughter and I

20
00:01:52.34 --> 00:01:54.34
Watch that video sometimes

21
00:01:55.74 --> 00:02:00.86
And I listen to that video sometimes not for the firefighter not for the bomb drop

22
00:02:00.86 --> 00:02:04.14
But to hear that laugh

23
00:02:07.06 --> 00:02:08.98
That laugh is coming from Seth Stone

24
00:02:11.50 --> 00:02:13.50
And you don't see him on camera

25
00:02:14.38 --> 00:02:19.06
But if you knew Seth then that laugh is unmistakable

26
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:24.06
And that's what I like to hear

27
00:02:26.54 --> 00:02:28.54
And that's reflective of life

28
00:02:28.54 --> 00:02:30.54
Because Seth was

29
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:38.34
He was tough and he was brave and he was smart and he was creative and he was a combat leader

30
00:02:41.54 --> 00:02:44.54
But above all those characteristics

31
00:02:46.34 --> 00:02:49.04
But I like to remember most about him now

32
00:02:51.18 --> 00:02:52.68
Now that he's gone is his laugh

33
00:02:52.68 --> 00:02:54.68
laugh

34
00:02:57.48 --> 00:03:02.80
Then humor is a blessing and laughter is an anodotepane and

35
00:03:03.60 --> 00:03:08.44
suffering and anguish and sometimes it's the only relief for those things

36
00:03:13.96 --> 00:03:18.24
I have another friend who wants to hold me everybody's got their Vietnam

37
00:03:18.24 --> 00:03:20.24
um

38
00:03:21.44 --> 00:03:25.80
And in this particular case he was talking about the fact that his first girlfriend when he was a kid

39
00:03:26.76 --> 00:03:31.70
Was older than him and was bigger than him and she would just pick him up and

40
00:03:32.32 --> 00:03:37.56
Kiss him against his will and it wasn't anything he could do about it and so he just had to deal with it

41
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
He just had to get through it

42
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:43.28
Everybody's got their Vietnam

43
00:03:44.28 --> 00:03:46.28
Tell me

44
00:03:46.28 --> 00:03:52.48
And he wasn't in Vietnam, no is he even a veteran, but he was just adding humor

45
00:03:54.32 --> 00:03:56.32
to life

46
00:03:57.48 --> 00:03:59.48
But there is some truth to that statement

47
00:04:00.60 --> 00:04:02.60
Everybody struggles in life

48
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:08.08
And those struggles very some struggles we face are imposed on us by the world

49
00:04:09.08 --> 00:04:12.84
Some struggles we face are imposed on us by ourselves

50
00:04:12.84 --> 00:04:19.92
They also vary in intensity and consequence and depending on who you are

51
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.44
When it's your problem when it's your struggle, that's the world

52
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:33.76
And as was with Seth one of the best ways to overcome struggle is humor comedy

53
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:40.56
And that same friend of mine certainly has used humor to get through his life

54
00:04:42.76 --> 00:04:48.12
Let's get through some of his struggles and some of those struggles more severe than just getting kissed by a seventh grader

55
00:04:48.12 --> 00:04:53.48
his name is Theo Vaughn and he's here with us tonight to share some of his struggles

56
00:04:55.92 --> 00:04:57.92
And some of the lessons he's learned

57
00:04:57.92 --> 00:05:05.64
and making everyone laugh as a comedian in order to overcome those struggles that we all face

58
00:05:06.20 --> 00:05:07.84
Theo, Theo Vaughn

00:05:08.84 --> 00:05:09.84

Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Stunman and I didn't know that guy but

64
00:05:20.84 --> 00:05:23.04

67
00:05:36.76 --> 00:05:37.92

00:05:44.56 --> 00:05:46.16

If anybody at this table has the board had more fears of rice on this I is cute brother to be honest man

71
00:05:51.32 --> 00:05:53.92
No offense there, but an advanced rice

72
00:05:55.64 --> 00:05:57.64
Yes, sorry, but um

73
00:05:58.04 --> 00:06:02.92

74
00:06:02.92 --> 00:06:05.12
I think everybody does have their own

75
00:06:05.52 --> 00:06:09.44
Theetnom, you know in some ways sometimes they're small and sometimes they're big, you know

76
00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:13.84
So numbers they're on the inside of us and so numbers are on the outside. Yes, I was

77
00:06:14.60 --> 00:06:19.80
One of my kids came home and this was I was telling the Navy at the time and I came home and there was like

78
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:24.80
Wars going on and there was something happened overseas and I was trying to contend with how we're gonna get

79
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:29.52
Guys prepared for this combat situation and I came home one time and

80
00:06:29.84 --> 00:06:33.92
You know one of my kids complained about something and it was some kind of real struggle

81
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:38.000
I forget what it was but I remember I first I was kind of like what you get in me

82
00:06:38.28 --> 00:06:40.28
We're at war

83
00:06:40.28 --> 00:06:45.08
I would say those words. I was able to keep us self-incheck, but what I realized was

84
00:06:45.08 --> 00:06:50.24
Whatever you're doing in life, that's that's that's the that's your world, right?

85
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:55.48
And so when that world gets tough and you don't know anything else man that that struggled that is your Vietnam

86
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:00.76
Yeah, and that's where people end up whether it's you know some girl kissing on you when you're

87
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:02.12
Whatever

88
00:07:02.12 --> 00:07:08.36
I'm gonna do well the tough part was other people were walked like the bigger bull with like my brother and his friends

89
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:13.48
The bus would pick them up first and so then it would come and get me and so that's when she would pick me up

90
00:07:13.48 --> 00:07:19.24
And it was like my first girlfriend so I was also like excited kind of a habit

91
00:07:19.24 --> 00:07:22.60
But I always kind of embarrassed honestly to have her like in front of I didn't want every

92
00:07:22.60 --> 00:07:25.96
I was just kind of she was just tougher than me, you know

93
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:28.20
He played I think baseball

94
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:32.44
You know and she could have played softball right right so she just opted

95
00:07:32.60 --> 00:07:35.24
Yeah, I mean she was doing that you know

96
00:07:35.96 --> 00:07:40.88
So yeah, it didn't even have that back then so let's get let's get into for those people

97
00:07:40.88 --> 00:07:44.000
A lot of people don't know who you are I guess that might listen to this podcast

98
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.20
I know you're really famous as a comedian right?

99
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:51.84
Yeah, that's the deal. Yeah, I've done what the well is a comedian man and so I'm grateful to have that

100
00:07:51.84 --> 00:07:54.72
I'm happy to be here today with you guys man, you know, I really am

101
00:07:54.72 --> 00:07:58.32
Thanks for having me. So you grew up. What were you born? I was born in

102
00:07:59.04 --> 00:08:02.000
Louisiana I was born in Louisiana and

103
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:05.20
Coming to Louisiana so

104
00:08:05.84 --> 00:08:09.76
Not a real pot. I mean it's a good place. We have tall a statue of Ronald Reagan

105
00:08:09.76 --> 00:08:11.76
That's cool and

106
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
He's never seen it, but we got

107
00:08:15.20 --> 00:08:18.000
So it was ever like what's the connection with the comedy?

108
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.44
Copper too. So like homeless dudes are always trying to like get in there and ship his thumbs off and you know

109
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:25.92
Get the reimbursement, but

110
00:08:26.08 --> 00:08:28.56
Why did why Reagan he

111
00:08:28.80 --> 00:08:34.24
Connected to that town at all they just somebody dug him somebody that had enough copper and joy them and I think donated to the city

112
00:08:34.24 --> 00:08:40.32
To be honest. No your dad was like a older gentleman when you were born. Oh, yeah

113
00:08:40.88 --> 00:08:44.24
Yeah, my dad was 70 years old my dad was born in 1910 and

114
00:08:45.76 --> 00:08:48.56
And he was from Nicaragua and he was

115
00:08:49.60 --> 00:08:51.68
So he was a senior citizen when I met him, you know

116
00:08:52.88 --> 00:08:55.76
So and he was from Nicaragua. Yeah, now I

117
00:08:56.56 --> 00:09:01.20
I saw that he was from bluefield Nicaragua. Yeah, he's from bluefield. I never been there

118
00:09:01.20 --> 00:09:06.24
But I heard a lot of I've heard it's a tough place to be sometimes because of their politics, but I heard it's really nice

119
00:09:06.24 --> 00:09:11.68
I heard that and I don't know what what's so what's your dad's like background? Was he from there?

120
00:09:11.68 --> 00:09:16.80
Because I guess this place was kind of settled by European pirates. Have you heard this?

121
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.96
Yeah, I don't know my dad was doing as younger. I don't remember seeing any other pictures of him

122
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:22.64
So I don't know I patches

123
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:29.28
Yeah, I never seen him, you know hanging out with a parrot. I've never seen any of his you know past work

124
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:37.68
When I knew him it was you know, it was just a lot of stories and there was more like the stories by the time I met him and stories, you know

125
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:43.36
They they get barnacles on him over time. They gain traction. They get tread. They get

126
00:09:43.92 --> 00:09:49.52
They take different avenues and so by the time I knew him it was more I was kind of left with the

127
00:09:50.48 --> 00:09:53.76
You know just the stories, you know the refined stories, you know

128
00:09:55.20 --> 00:09:56.88
What do you how do you end up in America?

129
00:09:56.88 --> 00:09:58.88
I don't know man

130
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:05.12
I really don't know him and those are things I wish that I had been able to know better and I think those are things

131
00:10:05.12 --> 00:10:10.96
We're synonymous like from me anyway where I feel disconnection sometimes is not haven't had that you know

132
00:10:10.96 --> 00:10:13.84
There's some of those types of conversations when I was old enough to kind of care

133
00:10:15.92 --> 00:10:21.52
Yeah, when I was like what once I got a like 12 or 13 I kind of I was like

134
00:10:21.52 --> 00:10:29.36
I mean it was kind of embarrassing you know having such an older time my dad would fall he'd be a sleep at like a vent he would fall asleep at the

135
00:10:30.48 --> 00:10:33.04
Carpool when he'd come pick us up he'd fall asleep and so

136
00:10:33.68 --> 00:10:41.28
The lady had to go wake him up. It was always like so much extra stuff that you don't think you have to do as a kid just a lot of like

137
00:10:42.08 --> 00:10:44.08
You know

138
00:10:44.08 --> 00:10:47.36
So but yeah, he was cool though, man. It was also interesting

139
00:10:47.36 --> 00:10:51.52
You know he knew a lot of people that are about to die everybody introduced who knew about to die

140
00:10:53.04 --> 00:10:58.32
What was the deal with your mom? I mean he must have been some kind of a you know he must have had some

141
00:10:58.96 --> 00:11:05.12
Cool characteristics because how old was your mom? My mom was 32 when I was born and he didn't have any money

142
00:11:05.92 --> 00:11:08.56
So I don't know who would bang an old dude with no

143
00:11:08.56 --> 00:11:11.52
My bro that's insane that is pioneer

144
00:11:11.52 --> 00:11:22.16
I know what woman that would I mean that is a pioneer woman. What was talking about a pioneer woman was he a woman

145
00:11:22.16 --> 00:11:24.32
Wah or something was he super like I

146
00:11:25.04 --> 00:11:28.80
Had a comb I remember that he kept in his pocket maybe it was

147
00:11:30.16 --> 00:11:35.20
Yeah, a nice one of those small cones man used to keep and they still keep up in cube a lot of time

148
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:37.84
You see a lot of Cuban men still get that small comb on

149
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:43.44
Mm-hmm, and you think that might have been the critical factor for for your mom looking at him thinking damn look at that comb

150
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:47.04
I think in a small town, you know, it's just that something like that can stand out

151
00:11:47.76 --> 00:11:53.52
Was your mom from Covington, Louisiana too? She's from Illinois, so she just real hard working lady

152
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.24
You know my mother really likes to work hard and she's

153
00:11:57.28 --> 00:12:01.12
Delivered newspapers and stuff when I was a kid and delivered all type of stuff

154
00:12:01.12 --> 00:12:08.72
Um, oh she used to deliver cookies for a little offer some company dude and I go laying her car at night and just lay on to on the box

155
00:12:08.72 --> 00:12:13.60
And just eat the bitches right just just imagine being the bonuses big is the box

156
00:12:13.60 --> 00:12:17.20
You're just laying on and you're opening up and that's my Vietnam

157
00:12:17.20 --> 00:12:21.12
You're in the dark you're trying to be quiet dude and sometimes they would tape a max treat

158
00:12:21.12 --> 00:12:23.12
You know you're like I'm gonna be all right

159
00:12:23.68 --> 00:12:27.76
And you just for you get in and you just has many cookies as you could have

160
00:12:27.76 --> 00:12:35.44
You're laying on your mouse laying an open on a like chocolate chip cookies. No, these are remember the ones they had were kind of

161
00:12:36.72 --> 00:12:39.36
a hard kind of yellow cookie with a bit of

162
00:12:40.16 --> 00:12:44.96
Kind of this granulated sugar kind of square look like glitter on the top. Yeah, let's start bread on

163
00:12:45.52 --> 00:12:47.20
I don't know

164
00:12:47.20 --> 00:12:52.88
I was excited about your story like I got your picture that but I just don't feel like char I'd feel like

165
00:12:52.88 --> 00:12:59.44
Cookies there's chocolate chip cookies and then everything else is kind of just not in the same ballpark

166
00:13:03.84 --> 00:13:07.04
I don't know if I'd agree with that sir. I don't know if I don't have to agree on everything

167
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:10.48
I'm just giving you my perspective. Yeah, no, and I appreciate you giving it to me, man

168
00:13:11.36 --> 00:13:13.36
And I would probably

169
00:13:13.68 --> 00:13:16.72
I'd watch you in a tough kid chocolate chip cookie at thing, you know

170
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:20.08
I'd watch I want to be fun to watch you eat, you know

171
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:26.80
I don't know a man go all that way pretty fun. I mean like man go, huh? I'll be enough then now let me get better for us

172
00:13:27.04 --> 00:13:34.64
No, I in fact I don't really I've like I grew up my my we didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up and so we ate a lot of hand burgers

173
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:37.04
Right like in the morning I would have

174
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:42.08
Handburger on an English muffin. Oh, you want to have handburger on bread and then for dinner

175
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:45.92
I have handburger on a bun so you get no all meals could be burgers

176
00:13:45.92 --> 00:13:52.64
That's what but I didn't really I didn't even like steak until I was maybe like 22 or 23

177
00:13:53.12 --> 00:14:00.08
Oh, yeah, yeah, because you just it didn't taste good to me. I mean, I would think why not just grind this thing up and put it on it put it into a patty

178
00:14:00.64 --> 00:14:01.92
Yeah, but you can't you

179
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:09.60
So I don't know maybe it's funny to watch me eat a burger on a muffin for breakfast. Yeah, I could see I think that would be unique show

180
00:14:09.60 --> 00:14:12.80
Watching strong man eat stuff. That's a little bit more dainty

181
00:14:12.80 --> 00:14:17.04
You know, maybe have a patty for some kind of a unique a

182
00:14:17.20 --> 00:14:20.40
Electable you know kind of a cookie from another country or something

183
00:14:21.12 --> 00:14:27.68
I could see that you can't even manage it with your fingers. You know, it's almost like a grenade almost to regular guy

184
00:14:28.40 --> 00:14:29.76
You know

185
00:14:29.76 --> 00:14:31.76
Did your mom and dad stay together?

186
00:14:32.72 --> 00:14:36.24
They stayed together for a while man they had four children and and

187
00:14:36.24 --> 00:14:40.24
And and

188
00:14:40.24 --> 00:14:44.96
Then I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened and that's kind of when I started to come like mentally

189
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:51.20
You know aware of my world and yeah at that point my dad was older he didn't live with us and then

190
00:14:53.60 --> 00:15:00.32
Yeah, we just had four children in my mom was working a lot and that's where we were three mom basically ended up as a single mom. Yes, you know, was a single mom and

191
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:04.08
Yeah, and I don't know

192
00:15:04.08 --> 00:15:09.76
I you were almost I don't know what you would expect kind of having a child or children with the older man

193
00:15:10.40 --> 00:15:12.80
You know what kind of expectations you might have

194
00:15:14.48 --> 00:15:18.40
But but I don't know you know, I don't know what kind of comfort she needed in a world

195
00:15:18.40 --> 00:15:22.08
Maybe she'd needed to have a family. I don't know what she needed at that time

196
00:15:22.80 --> 00:15:29.36
But yeah, and so they had the head children and then my dad was kind of gone and then I got a little a shame to my

197
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:33.20
I got embarrassed a little bit. I was just at that age. I think we're children get

198
00:15:35.44 --> 00:15:40.16
Were there if they're not like other children if the anything's out of the norm the night feel

199
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:46.64
Like something's wrong with them or they feel just embarrassed. I'm sure you see what your children did was a time were they getting embarrassed?

200
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:51.92
Yeah, it doesn't I don't think it matters if you're uh, you know like Tom Brady your kids are gonna be embarrassed

201
00:15:51.92 --> 00:15:57.12
Right or like doing the rock Johnson your kids will be like oh here comes the big 80

202
00:15:57.12 --> 00:15:59.12
It gets like I don't think the matters when you are

203
00:15:59.44 --> 00:16:04.40
It's gonna be your kids are gonna go through an age period where they're embarrassed by you. Yeah, and then

204
00:16:04.56 --> 00:16:10.72
You got to kind of like just work through it. I guess and hopefully come out the other side and they realize oh, you know

205
00:16:10.72 --> 00:16:12.32
That's not too bad

206
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:17.76
But I guess the weird thing you said you like your mom's expectations. I mean the fact that matter is

207
00:16:18.48 --> 00:16:21.92
He's 70 you're born. I mean expectations are

208
00:16:21.92 --> 00:16:29.36
They're not even expectations facts are he ain't gonna be around all of that much longer. Right. You know

209
00:16:29.36 --> 00:16:31.36
Yeah, she's been at a time offer. Yeah

210
00:16:31.76 --> 00:16:37.76
That's limited time. That's got an expiration date on so she signed up for because she kind of signed up for

211
00:16:38.24 --> 00:16:40.24
that activity. Yeah

212
00:16:40.48 --> 00:16:48.96
Yeah, and I think and and I think when sometimes I it's hard to not hold that anx when I look at my life in places that were uncomfortable for me as a child like

213
00:16:48.96 --> 00:16:52.88
Um, and I'm not complaining. I'm just trying to share some of you know share what

214
00:16:53.52 --> 00:16:55.52
Some of that was like from me, but um

215
00:16:56.08 --> 00:16:58.08
Yeah, I think it was Tyler it's like uh

216
00:16:58.88 --> 00:17:05.44
You felt like you weren't part of a plan like nobody planned or if you were it was a plan that was

217
00:17:06.72 --> 00:17:10.48
Destined to fail, you know what I'm saying it so then that almost makes you feel like

218
00:17:11.28 --> 00:17:14.64
What's going on if my commander and chief here my mother or something

219
00:17:14.64 --> 00:17:19.12
Set me up in this plan that doesn't seem like it has

220
00:17:20.08 --> 00:17:26.96
Statistically this doesn't seem super smart. No, no, now how old were you when you started having thoughts like that?

221
00:17:28.08 --> 00:17:34.000
I was it's you know that those are kind of thoughts when I was a kid like I was just thinking you know

222
00:17:34.48 --> 00:17:38.16
Machine gun throwing rocks uh you know taking apart

223
00:17:38.80 --> 00:17:42.08
Peep pieces of furniture. Yeah, I mean just talking ignorance stuff

224
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:45.76
Yeah, and it seems like you're sitting here thinking about the grand scheme and all these plans

225
00:17:45.76 --> 00:17:48.08
I count how old were you and you started going down that road?

226
00:17:48.08 --> 00:17:54.08
I don't think I was old. I think I was older when I when I started realizing that stuff. Okay, so this is like looking back. Yeah, a lot of

227
00:17:54.08 --> 00:17:56.08
That's looking back um

228
00:17:56.32 --> 00:18:00.72
But I think at the time I'm dealing with the ramifications of some of that without knowing it

229
00:18:01.28 --> 00:18:03.28
Without always wondering well what

230
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:06.96
Why do I feel certain ways or why do I behave certain ways?

231
00:18:06.96 --> 00:18:13.36
So like a subconscious. That's probably just that probably just a subconscious feeling of man

232
00:18:13.60 --> 00:18:17.92
This doesn't seem like this is gonna even as a little kid you're like man. We're eating ramen again

233
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Right who came up with this plan

234
00:18:20.40 --> 00:18:23.68
Right. Yeah, there's just no plant like moms work and there's no

235
00:18:24.40 --> 00:18:27.04
Dad so old so you start to get concerned

236
00:18:27.84 --> 00:18:34.16
For your dad's health and you have this weird uncomfortable thing where you're supposed to be kind of a child and be free to just

237
00:18:34.16 --> 00:18:41.20
Not have any worries, but you have these weird extra worries of like you know your dad is getting older you know and so

238
00:18:41.84 --> 00:18:43.84
I'm or being like eight years old

239
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:48.32
I'm walking to church it to what my dad we had to church a few blocks away and

240
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:51.84
He would ask me what the

241
00:18:52.08 --> 00:18:55.60
Where he could walk and stuff because of the sidewalks in Louisiana

242
00:18:56.40 --> 00:19:00.24
The the roots come up through them just like kneecaps just like you know

243
00:19:00.24 --> 00:19:05.92
You got a thousand long leg at man buried right there under the sidewalk, you know and some of them's you know

244
00:19:06.88 --> 00:19:09.96
You know they just it just real femury along those

245
00:19:09.96 --> 00:19:12.000
You know the sidewalks will do it down

246
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:14.88
They'll be in a damn trapezoid or some half of it

247
00:19:14.88 --> 00:19:18.32
Did you take this high walk? I don't think you can take you more time to get where you're going

248
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:22.000
You know I am the street is month the sidewalks like the Oregon trail

249
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.44
Well, there's natives under part of it. I mean it gets real dicey

250
00:19:25.44 --> 00:19:30.64
So I remember walking my dad and he's like can I walk here and stuff like that?

251
00:19:30.64 --> 00:19:33.60
So then you're I remember getting in this weird space of like

252
00:19:35.60 --> 00:19:38.88
Just hyper concern and awareness

253
00:19:39.36 --> 00:19:41.36
That's what I think it was awareness

254
00:19:41.84 --> 00:19:43.84
So then I had a lot of awareness

255
00:19:43.84 --> 00:19:46.88
So did that lead to you said behaviors?

256
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:53.52
What kind of behaviors do you think that this is a situation where you where you act and get in trouble in school

257
00:19:53.52 --> 00:20:00.16
Where you you know turn it into the delinquent kid where you trying to work real hard to make sure you always had money

258
00:20:00.16 --> 00:20:02.80
I mean what what how did you react to this situation?

259
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:09.04
Well, I think looking back on it and it's interesting because in my life right now

260
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:12.64
I've been doing a lot of work on this kind of stuff specifically like trying to just

261
00:20:13.84 --> 00:20:21.36
Just get enough comfort in the sediment or those sedimentary layers those real like just those deep layers

262
00:20:21.36 --> 00:20:26.88
It's hard for me to plant roots. I notice in my adult life and I think it's because something is the soils just

263
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:31.60
It's just not enough room in that soil from when I was a when I was younger

264
00:20:33.60 --> 00:20:38.08
And I wouldn't care if I was able to plant things in my life that would would be able to grow effectively

265
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:40.56
But I've had trouble doing that like relationships

266
00:20:41.04 --> 00:20:42.56
Commitment to things

267
00:20:42.56 --> 00:20:46.000
Wanting to start like a family or have a relationship but struggle with it

268
00:20:46.88 --> 00:20:48.40
So

269
00:20:48.40 --> 00:20:53.12
Sorry this isn't very funny dude. I feel bad guys, you know the one day. I mean everybody on your show

270
00:20:53.68 --> 00:20:56.32
Somebody dying or you know somebody got

271
00:20:56.56 --> 00:21:00.88
Naded out and then I'm so succumbed and I believe that I'm sitting here

272
00:21:00.88 --> 00:21:07.44
I don't think there's no one really that tuned into my podcast that's expecting or anticipating or it's gonna be let down if they're not

273
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.04
You know, we're

274
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:11.44
If there's not levity in the situation it's okay

275
00:21:11.44 --> 00:21:19.76
You don't have to be funny here you can just talk about just mayhem and death as far as I'm concerned it will still be good to go. Okay, okay, okay

276
00:21:19.76 --> 00:21:21.76
good yeah, I think so

277
00:21:22.56 --> 00:21:26.72
One of the things that I would know that I noticed now looking back is that I didn't

278
00:21:27.36 --> 00:21:33.12
Whenever I realized that that was my life situation that my dad was real older and that my mom was working all the time

279
00:21:35.12 --> 00:21:39.04
I didn't believe that the world was a comfortable place for me

280
00:21:39.04 --> 00:21:41.04
So as a real young kid I just

281
00:21:41.68 --> 00:21:46.40
There was enough elements in the atmosphere where I just made that choice has a

282
00:21:46.80 --> 00:21:49.44
My spirit made the choice whatever it is something inside of me

283
00:21:49.76 --> 00:21:52.24
It wasn't a choice I made like I would make a choice now

284
00:21:53.20 --> 00:21:56.72
It's like I don't trust the world to be a safe place for me

285
00:21:57.92 --> 00:21:59.20
So

286
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:03.36
Whatever brought me into this world whatever the elements are these are not trustworthy elements

287
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:11.12
And not that I would treat them on trust or not that I'd be mean to them but just in my spirit knows that you have to take care of yourself

288
00:22:11.12 --> 00:22:15.36
So then you start to try and manage everything yourself

289
00:22:17.20 --> 00:22:19.52
So I was always really concerned with

290
00:22:20.88 --> 00:22:27.76
The only thing I had left in like people would look at me, you know what the bus dropped me off like in the poor neighborhood and my dad was so old

291
00:22:27.76 --> 00:22:33.12
My mom was always gone working. She wasn't like a mom some of the other kids had so

292
00:22:35.04 --> 00:22:37.04
So the only thing I could control was me

293
00:22:37.84 --> 00:22:44.000
How you saw me that was it the only piece of my image I had was what you saw of me so

294
00:22:44.96 --> 00:22:48.56
I would like bike to school so I didn't have to get off the poor bus. I would like

295
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:52.56
But friend certain kids so you thought I was in a certain group

296
00:22:52.56 --> 00:23:00.16
I just I was hyper concerned with the kind of image management because it's all I had left

297
00:23:00.16 --> 00:23:05.60
You know I wouldn't I'm trying to be seen around my family. I kind of because I just didn't want

298
00:23:07.44 --> 00:23:12.08
I don't know I was just hyper concerned with the only thing that I had that I still I controlled over was

299
00:23:13.84 --> 00:23:15.52
My own

300
00:23:15.52 --> 00:23:20.88
Really and this is something yeah, it makes sense, but it's like this is something that you're realizing

301
00:23:20.88 --> 00:23:26.80
Reflectively looking back like at the time you were like you weren't constantly saying oh I'm I'm in Paris

302
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:28.40
So I'm gonna do this you were just like man

303
00:23:28.40 --> 00:23:31.28
I don't really want to get on that bus or get off that bus

304
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:37.28
I'm just gonna bike to school that seems like a smart thing to do right I think but I start to had I had so much awareness

305
00:23:37.28 --> 00:23:39.92
I think I just so aware all ways and so then

306
00:23:42.32 --> 00:23:46.96
You know, I just I think I was making choices that I didn't want people to see me a certain way how I'm

307
00:23:46.96 --> 00:23:51.84
I'm gonna be so then I got stuck in this how can I manage what people think of me?

308
00:23:53.04 --> 00:24:00.24
So was the was the was the image that you wanted to project because you could see there's plenty of people that there in those kind of

309
00:24:00.32 --> 00:24:02.32
Rough situations and there

310
00:24:02.32 --> 00:24:05.60
You know some people go all right. I'm gonna get straight A's and I'm gonna go to good college

311
00:24:05.60 --> 00:24:09.12
I'm gonna do all this other stuff or some people are well. I'm gonna become

312
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.64
You know, I'm gonna become a the toughest delinquent that there can be and people are gonna be scared of me

313
00:24:14.64 --> 00:24:17.52
So you know you get some going towards like big gang life or whatever

314
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:22.56
What was it that you were kind of moving towards were you in athlete we plan sports?

315
00:24:23.12 --> 00:24:26.48
Yeah, we play some decent sports in our neighborhood dude and it was real dicey bro

316
00:24:26.48 --> 00:24:27.92
We had a lot of people man

317
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:32.96
We had one dude who would sneak my weed pipe football and he bring matches with him and burn you while he was doing defense

318
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:38.72
Bro, and that's crazy when you're thinking okay, who's guard me? You know Thomas this kid Thomas though

319
00:24:38.72 --> 00:24:42.72
And he's just matching you down where you know if you're not making cuts real hard

320
00:24:42.72 --> 00:24:49.28
So just some shit like that man we played in this one field that had a big hole right in the middle of it

321
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:52.80
They're not to the middle but off off to the side with this church football field man and

322
00:24:53.76 --> 00:24:56.16
Damn people would go missing in that bitch

323
00:24:56.16 --> 00:25:02.40
So you know I mean this is a couple they had a family of 11 that I swear to God after a long game was a family attend

324
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:05.52
They lost somebody in their little Jennifer or somebody

325
00:25:05.92 --> 00:25:07.92
But I remember they did I remember

326
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:16.32
They would make girls they would put them on the football field playing football just in the neighborhood spray paint a number on his one kids back

327
00:25:17.36 --> 00:25:20.64
Just all kind of shit man fun stuff that looking back

328
00:25:21.20 --> 00:25:27.20
What about organized sports in high school? Did you play basketball when I was 11? I got into that when I was 11

329
00:25:27.20 --> 00:25:36.64
So yeah, I think one thing we just were around our neighborhood a lot we get we get home from school and we would just be up to our own devices, you know

330
00:25:38.08 --> 00:25:45.20
But one thing I started to notice was like I didn't I had a real untrustworthy relationship with the world

331
00:25:45.20 --> 00:25:51.60
So I was always worried about I think what people were thinking of me and I felt like people didn't like me

332
00:25:51.60 --> 00:26:01.60
I felt like I think because sometimes I don't know if I was just such an uncomfortable kid sometimes that I

333
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.72
Needed laughter so I always felt like if you were laughing you couldn't dislike me at a laugh at the same moment

334
00:26:09.60 --> 00:26:14.80
Like at that moment like it was down to that moment like when you were done laughing

335
00:26:16.08 --> 00:26:19.20
I didn't know what you thought of me, you know, and it was kind of scary because

336
00:26:19.20 --> 00:26:24.40
I think I didn't think much of myself and so the only

337
00:26:25.76 --> 00:26:32.24
Way I had to feel about myself from moments a moment was how other people felt about you know if I'm real honest and so

338
00:26:35.12 --> 00:26:38.72
So I think that's why I needed laughter because it was like oh man if I can get

339
00:26:38.72 --> 00:26:48.08
It was the only thing I trusted is that there's no way somebody could be laughing and I can see them laughing and having joy and

340
00:26:50.80 --> 00:26:54.96
And hate me at the same time, you know, it was just so that was like

341
00:26:56.48 --> 00:27:03.44
That was the only equation that made that to me was undeniable and I think that's

342
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:10.000
And I was a high-per sensitive kid, you know other people aren't as sensitive and so they're able, you know, they can

343
00:27:10.24 --> 00:27:13.04
Manage things better. I was high-per sensitive, you know

344
00:27:14.24 --> 00:27:16.88
So I'm really grateful that God gave me

345
00:27:18.88 --> 00:27:22.08
Whatever I needed to be able to find humor, you know

346
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:26.16
Because it was other kids in my neighborhood and in the environment that

347
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:31.12
That in my family didn't get that and so it's

348
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:38.80
And I'm trying to get any self-pity. I'm just trying to share what I'm thinking and feeling at the same time, you know

349
00:27:39.84 --> 00:27:44.08
And a lot of this is stuff I've been working through recently like in the past few weeks pretty heavily

350
00:27:44.48 --> 00:27:47.28
And so a lot of it's real fresh on my brain as well

351
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:48.72
You know

352
00:27:48.72 --> 00:27:54.48
Yeah, well, it's scary about well not scary. I from your perspective is the minute someone stops laughing

353
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:59.68
You just want to try and make a laugh again so you can get that get that good feeling back

354
00:27:59.68 --> 00:28:06.40
You know what's that safe feeling? I just need to it's like man, this is a place where I feel okay if they're laughing, you know

355
00:28:07.52 --> 00:28:13.20
So yeah, so I think and I wasn't like a goofy dude. I wouldn't like farting and a pudding or anything like that

356
00:28:13.20 --> 00:28:16.72
You know saying I wouldn't some you know booty creep or something

357
00:28:17.60 --> 00:28:22.88
I just like saying things and and I was real aware so I would see things kind of going on

358
00:28:23.76 --> 00:28:25.44
I think I was real aware and so

359
00:28:25.44 --> 00:28:33.12
So it was fun to be able to get people to laugh at moments where you didn't think they were and then you start managing laughter because

360
00:28:33.92 --> 00:28:36.40
laughter becomes your main

361
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.32
Tool that you have to feel okay and so

362
00:28:41.68 --> 00:28:46.08
Then you start using laughter almost like you're calling plays and stuff and you have these little

363
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:52.000
Those are my weapons, you know that was my knives that was my fist seat, you know I wasn't

364
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.80
I didn't have a lot of physical confidence so

365
00:28:55.76 --> 00:28:59.44
So laughter was it really for me that was my biceps, you know

366
00:29:00.96 --> 00:29:09.52
It seems like to uh there's an opportunity for someone that's in your position where you have this kind of like insecurity and kind of a little bit of a paranoia against the world

367
00:29:10.80 --> 00:29:18.24
To go down the path of like drug and alcohol abuse and we all know where that path ends up if we stay on it

368
00:29:18.24 --> 00:29:23.68
So how how did that enter your life and what what about there had to be drugs now alcohol down there what was

369
00:29:24.56 --> 00:29:26.56
What was that like what was that influence?

370
00:29:27.28 --> 00:29:30.32
How how did you manage that part of the world?

371
00:29:31.60 --> 00:29:38.64
Yeah, you know that's interesting you know I have family members in my own close family that have suffered with addiction and stuff like that

372
00:29:38.64 --> 00:29:48.32
um and I really love and I also love thinking about this kind of stuff like this kind of stuff from me talking about

373
00:29:49.52 --> 00:29:51.52
Feelings and stuff some people say well

374
00:29:52.48 --> 00:30:01.52
You know feelings is the past and actions is what matters and that's true. I believe that like I can think all day and it's probably not gonna help me act any different

375
00:30:01.52 --> 00:30:08.16
And I know in my own life if I do act a certain way my thoughts will follow me my thoughts really are your troops really

376
00:30:08.72 --> 00:30:10.72
you know

377
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:15.52
um they say in a lot of recovery rooms that you can't

378
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:21.44
Think your way in the right action, but you can act your way in the right thinking it's a common term and it's easy for

379
00:30:22.24 --> 00:30:24.24
People that struggle with

380
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.24
Addiction or addictive personalities to understand that it's real simple

381
00:30:30.24 --> 00:30:32.24
um

382
00:30:32.96 --> 00:30:34.96
So

383
00:30:34.96 --> 00:30:42.24
I was a question. I feel a little bit nervous just just as far as what you know how old were you in alcohol got introduced? How old are you?

384
00:30:42.24 --> 00:30:44.96
Yeah, we're doing I remember I found some liquor on some

385
00:30:46.88 --> 00:30:53.68
Alize liquor something peach mango star burst baby breath water melons something on the top shelf

386
00:30:53.68 --> 00:31:00.08
Who it was nine different colors bro and I found some newty mags up there to same time Teddy literature

387
00:31:01.20 --> 00:31:06.64
So next thing you know dude. I'm a jack-a-late and just just I remember falling off the shelf

388
00:31:06.64 --> 00:31:09.28
I thought I'm always I never made it off top shelf to those for their about four hours

389
00:31:09.84 --> 00:31:13.60
I've never been on the top shelf, you know, I don't come from a real balance in family

390
00:31:14.32 --> 00:31:20.48
So I'm up there dude. I'm drinking up I can master bait and you know and I remember just black and out and fall and off that shelf

391
00:31:20.48 --> 00:31:28.08
And I probably fell, man. I bet six and a half feet almost eight feet so not far. How old are you at this time?

392
00:31:28.08 --> 00:31:31.36
Oh, I was probably about 13, you know, and so then

393
00:31:31.92 --> 00:31:38.16
But I had other family members who were struggling with drug gen alcohol. So I had this really I didn't see that

394
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.60
Uh

395
00:31:41.60 --> 00:31:43.28
I didn't see that as like a

396
00:31:43.52 --> 00:31:47.52
Away from me to get in a thing like I didn't see that as an escape really from me

397
00:31:47.52 --> 00:31:50.24
So I never used that as an escape

398
00:31:51.68 --> 00:31:56.72
But as I got a little bit older my life I started realizing that I was uncomfortable

399
00:31:57.12 --> 00:31:59.12
uh and I was

400
00:32:00.16 --> 00:32:04.32
Some of the survival techniques I'd use as a child weren't helping me anymore

401
00:32:07.20 --> 00:32:11.20
You mean even the comedy piece even making people laugh did that start to wear out?

402
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:17.20
Well, or what survival is the only connection that I knew so I had a tough time making

403
00:32:17.20 --> 00:32:21.92
Reel connections with people especially women if I wanted to be in a relationship or

404
00:32:22.88 --> 00:32:26.64
Or even I think sometimes friends or knowing that a connection was safe like

405
00:32:27.28 --> 00:32:29.84
Sometimes I'll overdo a connection somebody will say

406
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:37.04
Yeah, everything's fine, man. We'll be there and I'll still be hyper worried about it. You know when it's fine it's as somebody else that's totally normal but

407
00:32:39.28 --> 00:32:45.12
Could some some connections with people are or always feel real new and scary to me

408
00:32:45.12 --> 00:32:47.12
I think I was a scared to make them

409
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:51.44
So anyway, I started realizing I was I'm trouble making real connections with people

410
00:32:52.48 --> 00:32:56.48
People would say man if like I don't know you but I feel like I would be sharing a lot of stuff

411
00:32:57.84 --> 00:33:00.48
and so then I

412
00:33:00.72 --> 00:33:07.68
I got into I started going to some recovery meetings 12 step and I couldn't relate to the drugs in alcohol

413
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:10.56
But I could relate when people talk about how they felt

414
00:33:11.60 --> 00:33:13.60
you know just

415
00:33:13.60 --> 00:33:15.60
Just the feelings and so

416
00:33:16.16 --> 00:33:21.68
I started learning about oh other people feel some of these ways and it's okay to have feelings or to

417
00:33:22.08 --> 00:33:27.28
struggle with them and whatever and so that's when I really started to like be in a part of recovery

418
00:33:28.16 --> 00:33:31.36
And there's all types of it, you know, I mean, there's stuff for everything

419
00:33:31.36 --> 00:33:35.20
There's recovery for people that wear shirts that don't fit or that fit too tightly

420
00:33:37.60 --> 00:33:40.56
It's really drags me down hang now with echo

421
00:33:40.56 --> 00:33:44.72
Because I think it's kind of people up you got each other and it just turns into a bad

422
00:33:44.72 --> 00:33:46.72
So I'm gonna say I see who you're dealer is

423
00:33:48.72 --> 00:33:53.84
You guys need not behind freaking autos own as fucking pick up a couple extra small

424
00:33:54.56 --> 00:33:58.000
Head part is there is a small boy out there somewhere right now

425
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Maybe you'll never share it on a shirt

426
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:03.68
Have we talked about them before Jacko?

427
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:04.72
Did we talk about that?

428
00:34:04.72 --> 00:34:07.20
Talk about what some boy with a small shirt

429
00:34:07.20 --> 00:34:09.20
I don't know if we talked about that

430
00:34:09.20 --> 00:34:14.24
So yeah, so I think that's why I found 12 stuff was interesting and then I pretty that was later in my flight

431
00:34:14.24 --> 00:34:19.28
Yeah, that was later in life so for a long time I think I just chose comedy because it

432
00:34:20.80 --> 00:34:26.64
Do instead of comedy oh it's like a lifestyle of disconnection you're in town for four or five days and then you go

433
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:32.80
So if you have a relationship starting you're like up, you know, you gotta go to chuckle willies

434
00:34:32.80 --> 00:34:39.36
Ever into coma you know, it's how it's like you're out of town and then and then you're in a new place where you can have something you know it's like

435
00:34:41.12 --> 00:34:48.16
The the moss of life never has a chance to grow on you really you keep out running

436
00:34:49.52 --> 00:34:52.80
The moss really and the moss is things that

437
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:59.68
That are real or you know were barnacles anything that you just you just evade things enough

438
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:04.08
And comedy just offered me that I don't even know if I wanted to be a comedian

439
00:35:04.08 --> 00:35:07.28
I think I wanted to not have to be somewhere

440
00:35:08.32 --> 00:35:14.08
So what how old were you and you did your first you know god on stage and did your first stand-up gig?

441
00:35:15.84 --> 00:35:17.84
Let me think man

442
00:35:18.08 --> 00:35:20.08
It was Rwanda dude. I think it was

443
00:35:20.88 --> 00:35:22.48
2001

444
00:35:22.48 --> 00:35:24.48
midnight

445
00:35:24.48 --> 00:35:26.48
And I was in a

446
00:35:26.48 --> 00:35:31.68
I think I was in a fox hole or Falcon Esther song. I don't know what was happening. Do we couldn't see?

447
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:36.24
We got a bad badge of banana taffy from a local

448
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:39.04
She was dicey

449
00:35:39.04 --> 00:35:41.04
Then we're fire

450
00:35:41.04 --> 00:35:42.08
Fire ants

451
00:35:42.08 --> 00:35:47.20
There was a there was not yeah not fire fight. There was actual fire ants in the hole even first. Yeah

452
00:35:47.76 --> 00:35:49.76
No, sorry, let's tryna

453
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:52.88
Trying to make you laugh a little but um

454
00:35:54.48 --> 00:35:56.08
Was it local?

455
00:35:56.08 --> 00:35:59.60
Oh, yeah, I was cool school when I was oh I remember

456
00:36:00.08 --> 00:36:05.84
Well the best thing was just at the lunch table with your friends and I think that's the thing you're always chasing as a comedian

457
00:36:05.84 --> 00:36:10.56
It's just being in an environment where you're just making your friends laugh, you know

458
00:36:11.84 --> 00:36:16.40
But I went to a class in Los Angeles a lot of people don't even know that I went to a class

459
00:36:16.64 --> 00:36:23.28
Like a comedy class yeah like when you see written like just like putting those cheesy horns letters on the side of a strip

460
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:28.48
All the other I was always wondering who's side of the thing there you go apparently may work

461
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.92
Did it and it was so weird that it was some guy at work. He can not all know so

462
00:36:35.28 --> 00:36:37.28
Your future of blind at homes

463
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:45.60
Oh yeah, I think the class was even sponsored by like a pet boy. There's some quick oil offering out

464
00:36:45.60 --> 00:36:53.04
So man, we were in the class and it was but the interesting you think about the class was it was not very

465
00:36:53.76 --> 00:36:57.04
I don't know if it was helpful. It was an environment where you were joking around

466
00:36:58.08 --> 00:37:02.64
But the thing was at the end of the class you got to perform on stage at a real comedy club

467
00:37:03.36 --> 00:37:10.000
So that was the thing and they taped it for you and this now everybody's got tape this back when that limited amount of tape

468
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.24
Good so you had a tape maybe had that cassette though, you know and so I remember

469
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:21.68
I got a thing that would do three minutes and you were so nervous but then you had a tape and so then you felt like

470
00:37:22.24 --> 00:37:29.12
Oh, I have a piece of proof you know and then after that they had a comedy room near me just what gentleman had half a little

471
00:37:30.40 --> 00:37:32.40
And he was

472
00:37:32.88 --> 00:37:37.44
He was missing part of his leg. I think or he said he was so he could have been fake at it

473
00:37:37.44 --> 00:37:41.12
CGI or something. I don't know what his name was

474
00:37:42.40 --> 00:37:44.40
I mean it was a

475
00:37:44.40 --> 00:37:47.44
CGI it was no it was a white dude. Okay, but

476
00:37:48.72 --> 00:37:50.08
Anyway

477
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.40
Yeah, he opened up a comedy room about two blocks from where I was living in LA and I went over there on Wednesdays and

478
00:37:58.32 --> 00:38:01.92
And there was a couple times right quit. I moved back to New Orleans and they had a comedy room there

479
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:08.80
How you making money when you're working it? I mean this guy is even paying you or you paying that to get to perform or you paying him

480
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:13.44
I was a lot of it was a bringer show. You got to bring people and if you don't bring enough you have to pay

481
00:38:14.24 --> 00:38:18.48
So that was part of it man. That's it that's a under that's a dirty

482
00:38:19.28 --> 00:38:21.76
Subculture business of a comedy

483
00:38:22.08 --> 00:38:31.04
Brutal just a bring or show what you said. Yeah, big all bringer shows and you got to bring people with you and if you don't bring like five people and then

484
00:38:31.04 --> 00:38:37.20
You know, probably ten dollars again and there's something then you have to pay that the difference but on the fifty dollars

485
00:38:38.08 --> 00:38:45.68
So so this is that's where you start in comedy. That's where it's at yeah, that's really where I start and now and honestly man when I started

486
00:38:45.68 --> 00:38:47.68
I knew I

487
00:38:47.68 --> 00:38:50.88
knew that I was doing pretty good at it when I started

488
00:38:50.88 --> 00:38:53.68
I knew that I could do it and I knew that I could do it and

489
00:38:54.40 --> 00:38:58.24
Then once the lifestyle came along where you got to scoot around and be

490
00:38:58.24 --> 00:39:04.64
Anyplace that I didn't have to make a real connection which I didn't realize wasn't a strong suit of mine really

491
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:07.20
I didn't really realize it at that point. I didn't really realize I was

492
00:39:07.84 --> 00:39:14.16
Evating something I thought I was going towards something and I think it's probably like that for a lot of us in all types of

493
00:39:15.28 --> 00:39:16.32
jobs

494
00:39:16.32 --> 00:39:18.88
You know sometimes the feeling I'm chasing it's

495
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:25.92
It's not so much something that I'm going for as if I can figure out if there's something that I'm trying to be away from

496
00:39:25.92 --> 00:39:31.84
You know and that's just for me. I don't know if that's really for everybody in the in the seal teams we used to say like

497
00:39:33.36 --> 00:39:37.20
Well, you know if I mean things get bad, you know you just get going a trip to get on that plane

498
00:39:38.24 --> 00:39:42.32
Everything's for everything's gone no more problems you're in some new place everything's great now

499
00:39:42.56 --> 00:39:44.24
Yeah, that was the that was the deal

500
00:39:44.24 --> 00:39:48.32
You know, so whatever's happening you know you have some guy living out here in San Diego

501
00:39:48.32 --> 00:39:51.84
He's having problems with this wife for his girlfriend or whatever cool going on a trip

502
00:39:51.84 --> 00:39:58.08
Don't complain no problems anymore. They're all gone similar thing. Yeah, evading the problems

503
00:39:59.20 --> 00:40:03.20
Yeah, and I was and I didn't yeah, and I didn't know I was doing that you know

504
00:40:03.20 --> 00:40:08.08
I just didn't know and then also you're out there you have you're able to establish brief relationships

505
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:12.000
You know one night stands you know a little bit of sex here and there

506
00:40:12.48 --> 00:40:15.84
a little bit of touch and jerking off next to someone not even sex

507
00:40:16.48 --> 00:40:20.72
Sometimes or even just jerking off by yourself and wishing somebody was there

508
00:40:20.72 --> 00:40:24.88
You know, which is really one I mean that was that was probably two out of three

509
00:40:26.72 --> 00:40:29.52
Like only one of those sounded like a relationship

510
00:40:29.52 --> 00:40:34.24
You know what's out of like perversion and you're the one who just sounded lovely so I don't know worse

511
00:40:35.28 --> 00:40:40.48
You know you're kind of getting a taste for maybe what it really is you could be but if you got a good imagination

512
00:40:40.48 --> 00:40:44.88
Do you could ever feel time right there with you know and I was strong bro in the freaking

513
00:40:45.52 --> 00:40:48.72
In that middle freaking cold and I was really running some strong suit

514
00:40:48.72 --> 00:40:54.48
So you would you be out melee how long you out out out now lay for I've been out there

515
00:40:54.48 --> 00:40:56.80
You know I'd be out there for months at a time

516
00:40:56.80 --> 00:41:00.64
And then what would make you would you just run out of money and be like I'm going back to Louisiana?

517
00:41:00.64 --> 00:41:04.64
Yeah, something would be uncomfortable. I have a long term relationship for a little while

518
00:41:04.64 --> 00:41:07.84
Which is like the closest relationship I could get into is having one with a you know

519
00:41:08.32 --> 00:41:10.32
thousand miles of space in it and

520
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Yeah, so I

521
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.28
Yeah, and then comedy but comedy kept doing good it was like this thing and when I look back

522
00:41:21.28 --> 00:41:23.04
I really think it was something God that just

523
00:41:24.40 --> 00:41:28.64
You know God just wanted to keep taking care of me, you know even though I think when I was young

524
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:31.60
I always when I didn't trust the world out in trust God

525
00:41:31.60 --> 00:41:36.16
I didn't trust that anybody had like was looking out for me. What what years is this?

526
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:39.20
This probably 2,000

527
00:41:39.20 --> 00:41:41.20
and

528
00:41:41.36 --> 00:41:43.36
Probably 2,000

529
00:41:43.36 --> 00:41:45.36
9,000 about 2016

530
00:41:46.16 --> 00:41:47.36
I was saying

531
00:41:47.36 --> 00:41:50.16
2,000 so during this time you're

532
00:41:51.04 --> 00:41:54.08
Like what's the progression? Once you would you do good with

533
00:41:55.20 --> 00:42:00.64
Bring or show once you get good at that like okay now you're almost always gonna have people coming in

534
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:07.44
At what point do you I will point you you think in yourself all right? I can I can live I can make I can pay my rent

535
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:09.44
I can get food from

536
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:13.84
Comedy right why I got I got a credit card

537
00:42:14.48 --> 00:42:19.36
That's that what point okay when I got that credit card boy then Delta reserve they hit me up in the mail

538
00:42:19.36 --> 00:42:23.04
Bro, you know and I looked at some of the planes online I said these people are doing well

539
00:42:23.04 --> 00:42:25.04
I'm open I can't with them

540
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:27.84
So I went probably about 30 something thousand dollars in debt

541
00:42:28.72 --> 00:42:32.80
Over probably about four years which was a lot of debt when you never had had

542
00:42:33.20 --> 00:42:35.60
You know three thousand dollars in a bank account

543
00:42:35.60 --> 00:42:41.04
So for all those years are you paycheck to paycheck? Yeah, just paycheck to paycheck

544
00:42:41.04 --> 00:42:46.88
Maybe you have 800 bucks in your bank account maybe you got a thousand maybe did a good show and you maybe got 1400

545
00:42:46.88 --> 00:42:49.52
But then you got a buy a new freaking whatever

546
00:42:50.88 --> 00:42:54.40
Yeah, the next flight is the biggest okay was that next flight

547
00:42:55.28 --> 00:42:57.28
So this is a struggle

548
00:42:57.68 --> 00:43:03.84
It's a struggle and it's start it is a struggle honestly and I look I know it's it's it's my own struggle

549
00:43:03.84 --> 00:43:07.52
It's the struggle in that sense. I'm not other people have way bigger struggles

550
00:43:08.08 --> 00:43:11.76
But it's uh, but that's the struggle part of that job at a minimum

551
00:43:11.76 --> 00:43:17.04
It's a financial struggle. Yes, and you are you looking at it thinking well, I'll be doing this for

552
00:43:17.44 --> 00:43:21.36
The rest of my life like for rest of my life. I'm gonna be sitting here, you know going from town to town

553
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:26.88
Making $480 one night. Is that how much you make when you're one of these level comedians?

554
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:32.72
No, I think at that point if you do a feature weekend somewhere you can get paid $600 for about five shows

555
00:43:32.72 --> 00:43:34.72
But you have to buy your flight

556
00:43:34.88 --> 00:43:40.64
So that takes 300 if you eat on 80 this is a learn it. You know you think about mixed martial arts

557
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:47.12
Besides UFC like when you're a young these fighters like I've trained a ton of fighters

558
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:50.56
That's what they're doing yeah, they're they're going to fight in Nebraska

559
00:43:50.72 --> 00:43:57.04
They're gonna get paid $200 to fight $200 if they win and the flight out there cost freaking 800 bucks

560
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:01.20
And they got to pay medical for their check-up. It's a freaking disaster

561
00:44:01.20 --> 00:44:03.20
Yeah

562
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:06.24
The same thing right it really is I think I really

563
00:44:06.24 --> 00:44:10.56
Yeah, at the end of the gather carry it they have two of their teeth taped into their belly button

564
00:44:11.84 --> 00:44:18.08
It's dicey. Oh, yeah, it's just that circuit. It's that circuit. It's the circuit of that thing and it's

565
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:24.64
The benefits are the things that keep that are kind of nice and especially if you don't know

566
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:31.60
If other people are settling down getting married your friends getting real jobs at see more real on paper and

567
00:44:32.56 --> 00:44:34.56
those things are

568
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:39.44
I didn't want to be like everybody else that's the thing I always remember my head

569
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:41.44
I didn't want to be like a lot of people

570
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:45.04
I wanted to manage my embassy only thing I had was

571
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:51.60
Everything else in my life since my birth it felt like it was like a sentence like this is who you are you are

572
00:44:52.56 --> 00:44:54.56
somebody who

573
00:44:54.56 --> 00:44:59.20
You know, you're not you're not going to be in a home where you were really loved you're not

574
00:44:59.92 --> 00:45:04.24
You know things like that. I'm not complaining. I'm just sharing what I felt like and it's some of this might

575
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:09.44
It even be real. That's a crazy part of some of the stuff it could be in your head but if to me it was very real

576
00:45:11.04 --> 00:45:15.60
So the only thing I could still control was what I what you saw me how I

577
00:45:15.60 --> 00:45:22.88
What I was you know and I was just getting a hold out to try and be something I

578
00:45:24.64 --> 00:45:30.32
Don't know if I knew what it was what I was just gonna hold out so when you're a comedian making

579
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:34.08
$600 for five shows in a weekend that you had to pay

580
00:45:34.56 --> 00:45:37.44
$740 for your ticket to get out to wherever you were

581
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.16
The what is making it at that time because I think it's changed and that's where I was trying to one one

582
00:45:44.16 --> 00:45:47.36
Yeah, like nowadays you know, there's different avenues since

583
00:45:47.92 --> 00:45:52.08
What social media is out there and you can use that avenue YouTube you can use that avenue

584
00:45:52.64 --> 00:45:56.48
Podcasts you can use that there's all these different avenues, but you go rewind

585
00:45:57.04 --> 00:45:58.40
10 years

586
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:01.44
Like there's none of that oh yeah, you can't make a living from

587
00:46:01.84 --> 00:46:03.44
YouTube wasn't even a thing

588
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:08.80
Yeah, so nothing so you're just just freaking comedy club the comedy club

589
00:46:09.60 --> 00:46:10.80
What was

590
00:46:10.80 --> 00:46:16.72
quote making it back then okay, did you get a did you did you did you see that as a possibility?

591
00:46:17.20 --> 00:46:22.000
I got three thousand I remember it again. May three thousand did the comedy central like

592
00:46:22.24 --> 00:46:26.40
10 minutes or something and they give you a three thousand three thousand for comedy central

593
00:46:26.40 --> 00:46:32.000
Yeah, you do 10 minutes they give you $3000. Yeah, the big-ass network a comedy center

594
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:34.16
That's like these fight organizations

595
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:41.92
It's the ultimate fighting kind of the all-the-eye was comedy. It was just it was like obviously

596
00:46:42.32 --> 00:46:46.56
It was just a different day. It was just a different day no wider. It's just a different organization, you know

597
00:46:47.28 --> 00:46:52.000
But then also they had all the eyeballs then they had the eyeballs and so yes

598
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.36
So you got a little money and then you start to get a little neurotic no rioty from the deal from like you could

599
00:46:57.76 --> 00:47:01.52
Show people oh I really am a comedian that was that that's the scariest part of the comedian

600
00:47:01.52 --> 00:47:03.52
Because you're a comedian and

601
00:47:04.24 --> 00:47:11.12
Then do you could tell people here a comedian, but it's a real weird thing to tell people until you have some proof

602
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:15.04
That you are a dude because unless not you could be a just a

603
00:47:16.32 --> 00:47:18.16
Just a I'm a comedian for all-perfect

604
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:21.20
You're a person right you know, well, I'm a comedian you can be a murderer

605
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.80
Do a better suited to be a murderer than a comedian. It's all good definitely man and I always love

606
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:34.56
Pippin Tom and man since I was a kid did I love Pippin Tom that's really not one of the best things to talk about on the podcast

607
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:37.36
If you want to maintain you know yourself not being a person

608
00:47:39.20 --> 00:47:45.12
Look, I'm a recovery freaking pita your baby, you know, but that's one thing you need about recovery and being on the circles

609
00:47:45.12 --> 00:47:46.96
I have friends that are flashers dude

610
00:47:46.96 --> 00:47:52.16
I have friends that have I mean I have friends that have just gone and knocked on the devil's door

611
00:47:52.16 --> 00:47:58.000
Dude and waited there till he opened it. You know, I'm saying bro and the devil works over time. Yeah, rarely as he hung

612
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
He's 247 open in that door up. So if you're a male and out there does hanging on that friggin velcom

613
00:48:05.28 --> 00:48:10.88
So so comedy central you got this money and now you're kind of I mean other calm coming to you

614
00:48:10.88 --> 00:48:15.60
I'm gonna choose yes, but also other comedians you're kind of like elevated right? Yeah, you started to get elevated

615
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:17.60
You're sort of a man yeah

616
00:48:17.60 --> 00:48:22.64
Little bit you get enough that booth that then it tells you okay this path is starting to choose you

617
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:25.60
There's I think there's a unique moment in different paths where

618
00:48:26.72 --> 00:48:31.60
Your chew your your your putting yourself into the path and then the path is also saying hey

619
00:48:32.24 --> 00:48:38.64
You know putting its handouts and I do believe that for a comedians man at a certain point it kind of chooses you

620
00:48:39.44 --> 00:48:44.88
So once you do comedy central now our when you're going to a comedy club are you headlining now?

621
00:48:44.88 --> 00:48:50.32
You have a credit you're getting close and you're starting to headline and then you get like 1500 a week

622
00:48:50.88 --> 00:48:54.32
So that's when you can start to save a little money and and

623
00:48:55.52 --> 00:49:01.68
And you're not selling tickets though you were just most people are coming there's a few people come to see you maybe 10 15 people

624
00:49:02.24 --> 00:49:04.08
But also back then the

625
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:10.16
The clubs had all the email list they were a gatekeeper so they you know you don't have all that you can start to put it together

626
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:12.56
We'd put the cards on the table fill it out and like

627
00:49:12.56 --> 00:49:17.36
But then you're coming before you have to do that and and I did it all man put the boxes with the cards

628
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:20.64
See are you do you have a manager or whatever like that thing?

629
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:24.16
Yes, you have a manager that helps you through the agencies to get booked

630
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:30.88
But you don't have you taking their cut. Yeah, they take their cut so you're getting 1500 bucks and they're taking one 50

631
00:49:30.88 --> 00:49:35.20
On 50 and then the agent would take one 50 and so then you down a 12 there

632
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.52
but

633
00:49:37.52 --> 00:49:40.64
But yeah, you still grind it and I still didn't have any other

634
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:50.000
In life there's only so you you I find you I mean they're doing something that I want to be doing or I'm a touch in my life to other people

635
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.60
And maybe starting a family kind there's not really a ton of different things to do you know

636
00:49:57.28 --> 00:50:01.84
Really I mean you just so I didn't I didn't have anything on that other side of the coin

637
00:50:01.84 --> 00:50:05.92
I didn't have any place where I felt like I could make a commitment or start a family so I'm like well

638
00:50:05.92 --> 00:50:12.88
This is this shoe just fits so well right now. How how many days a year are you touring at this time?

639
00:50:12.88 --> 00:50:15.20
Oh, I did man. I probably did 48 weeks a year

640
00:50:16.32 --> 00:50:18.16
I toured hard man. I toured

641
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:25.52
I toured hard man. I really did and some of and here's a crazy thing. This is one thing I noticed about a brain of somebody that has

642
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:29.20
has maybe issues with

643
00:50:30.88 --> 00:50:33.84
Alcoholism stuff like that my brain forgets that

644
00:50:33.84 --> 00:50:37.52
My friend forgets work forgets all that I did all that work

645
00:50:39.04 --> 00:50:43.20
So my brain every day has this weird govern around it that's like man you

646
00:50:44.40 --> 00:50:50.32
You got to do something and you know you haven't done anything you know I got this weird and I sometimes I don't know where

647
00:50:50.32 --> 00:50:54.32
Some of that comes from and and those are things. I still want to figure out in my life

648
00:50:54.32 --> 00:50:57.04
You know where does that come from you know some of those things so

649
00:50:58.08 --> 00:51:01.68
Those are things I love kind of thinking about and talk with people about it's like

650
00:51:01.68 --> 00:51:03.68
um

651
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:05.68
Yeah, where do these weird like

652
00:51:06.48 --> 00:51:09.76
This weird legal system that's that I built into my soul

653
00:51:11.12 --> 00:51:18.88
Where does that where does that all come from and and it's interesting you can figure some of the times you can figure some of that out by talking with other people about

654
00:51:19.28 --> 00:51:26.72
That sort of thing anyway. What do you feel like the prosecution and the defense are our arguing over with the legal system? That's in your head

655
00:51:26.72 --> 00:51:34.48
But the prosecution is always just a never there was never like a base foundation that I'm okay

656
00:51:35.76 --> 00:51:41.84
So when I don't have that then anything else has a really good chance of infiltrating and

657
00:51:42.56 --> 00:51:46.16
Getting really into me because there never was this

658
00:51:50.40 --> 00:51:54.80
Like out of friend one time who just texted me that hey man, you're okay, you know just out of the blue

659
00:51:54.80 --> 00:51:58.56
And because he knows we talked about stuff he's in recovery and

660
00:51:59.44 --> 00:52:05.52
Man, that shit just hit me like never in my life. I just heard that or and it just came through it a certain way where I heard it

661
00:52:05.52 --> 00:52:09.36
I was like oh man and just I'm just like ball. I'm just like

662
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:15.20
So I think just when you don't have that weird that foundation of that anybody just telling you that or the world

663
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:20.48
To are just like you feel in it, you know them you feel sometimes you always will feel susceptible

664
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:23.20
to any other

665
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:24.56
Then of course you have to build your own

666
00:52:25.36 --> 00:52:29.52
Thing in your head that's like you gotta get going you gotta get you gotta pull yourself up by the bootchecks

667
00:52:29.52 --> 00:52:31.04
You so you do that

668
00:52:31.04 --> 00:52:35.60
But then after you're doing well even that thing still going on that's a childhood system

669
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:40.80
You put in that bitch is loose dude and that bitch is out there fucking party is got tits dude

670
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:43.92
You don't understand this turn it up and it's fucking it

671
00:52:43.92 --> 00:52:47.52
It just doesn't there's no control but that thing has been with you for so long

672
00:52:47.52 --> 00:52:55.44
That is hard to get new systems in place to stop those survival things because something had to be in my head

673
00:52:55.44 --> 00:52:57.44
It's tell me to keep going you know

674
00:52:58.24 --> 00:53:04.20
But as you get older it's just still running on the same childhood system the same original

675
00:53:04.20 --> 00:53:06.20
DOS or whatever Microsoft DOS

676
00:53:06.72 --> 00:53:10.40
So did you ever have a point where you're like in

677
00:53:10.40 --> 00:53:19.20
In freakin whatever upstate New York you just performed in front of seven people that were talking while you were up on stage

678
00:53:19.20 --> 00:53:23.12
And then you had to pay the money and you were like, you know what dude?

679
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:25.12
I'm going to get a job and make it these

680
00:53:25.12 --> 00:53:27.12
Did you have that

681
00:53:27.12 --> 00:53:37.32
Yeah, yeah, I got a do in tacos selling Mexican food to peeing and I'd sold all kind of food to people of a restaurant and stuff like that

682
00:53:37.32 --> 00:53:38.32
I used to sell

683
00:53:38.32 --> 00:53:41.44
I sold Mexican food to people when I was younger too

684
00:53:41.44 --> 00:53:46.28
But did you ever have a point where you would like yeah, I gave up at that point. Where's a point where I gave up?

685
00:53:46.28 --> 00:53:50.20
Oh, you gave up on comedy at some point. Yeah, I had this girl had it was in this long-term

686
00:53:50.84 --> 00:53:55.60
Relationship and I went back to New Orleans and worked at a bar and we was selling Mexican food to people

687
00:53:56.72 --> 00:53:58.72
above board it was legal shit and

688
00:54:00.88 --> 00:54:02.88
And they had a

689
00:54:02.88 --> 00:54:08.16
Margarita machine in there and I was working at that boy, you know, and just doing what I could and

690
00:54:09.36 --> 00:54:15.42
And then I have some guy came in who worked neck is door and he said like one thing to me and it just

691
00:54:15.96 --> 00:54:21.84
Set me off like true did you like a chopper something? Yeah, treating me like I was somebody that didn't

692
00:54:26.96 --> 00:54:29.72
It was like some rich do some rich, you know

693
00:54:29.72 --> 00:54:35.04
Second hand generation rich or third hand generation rich, you know somebody look

694
00:54:35.04 --> 00:54:38.20
I'll say this somebody in their family probably had some cotton on them

695
00:54:38.52 --> 00:54:40.12
Okay

696
00:54:40.12 --> 00:54:44.70
And when I was more of a polyester bad boy, you know, I was saying I was one of those fucking

697
00:54:44.70 --> 00:54:47.48
You know, I was saying those synthetic fabrics. Oh, okay

698
00:54:48.08 --> 00:54:50.08
Racism free daddy. Okay

699
00:54:50.60 --> 00:54:53.32
So this dirty said something. Yeah, and it just

700
00:54:53.96 --> 00:54:58.000
And oh and his family partially owned the place. It was a business next door. They sold wine

701
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.14
Like Gary V or whatever a guy's name is Jerry V telling people to fucking sell their home is sleeping or york

702
00:55:04.14 --> 00:55:08.64
You know what I'm saying and that dude was raised on a damn wine wine farmer

703
00:55:08.64 --> 00:55:13.02
So he said it if fucking you don't say and dude hiding grapes in his ass at night

704
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:18.64
Freezing grapes and fucking hiding in his ass and he's telling people how to struggle dude

705
00:55:18.64 --> 00:55:24.36
That guy had his mind like oh damn dude. Oh, he still have silver wearing your house fucking sell it and he shows up

706
00:55:24.36 --> 00:55:28.08
You know like hugged the dude the guy can't even he has nobody get food in his mouth

707
00:55:28.08 --> 00:55:34.42
You know the guys fucking just knuckle and threw some powder knuckle and threw some bouillon base and he's like

708
00:55:34.42 --> 00:55:38.52
No worries me. He's $76 last night and he hugs him

709
00:55:38.52 --> 00:55:40.76
You know what I was saying is like what the fuck

710
00:55:41.88 --> 00:55:44.84
And they'd drive off in the family just standing there in a park

711
00:55:46.76 --> 00:55:48.76
Another winner

712
00:55:48.76 --> 00:55:50.76
How is it fucking

713
00:55:50.76 --> 00:55:57.36
My dude any hugs. Oh he sold two extra Christmas sweaters. You didn't need from last year

714
00:55:57.36 --> 00:55:58.76
They're all in the gather

715
00:55:58.76 --> 00:56:00.76
What is going on there

716
00:56:02.40 --> 00:56:03.40
Oh

717
00:56:03.40 --> 00:56:07.24
But anyway, I don't what it looked man. I got just loves a boy boy kid

718
00:56:07.64 --> 00:56:11.64
I was sorry the videos. I'm not saying the guys that is for a guy

719
00:56:12.24 --> 00:56:15.76
The videos though and the guy grew up well off

720
00:56:15.76 --> 00:56:21.04
Well, no, I think he actually didn't grow up well off. That's part of his that's going to be lying

721
00:56:21.04 --> 00:56:24.80
No, you partially lying, but it's not really lying if you don't know but he was

722
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.68
You know his dad owned like a corner-lick restore or something and he did you know he got a after-increated the

723
00:56:31.68 --> 00:56:34.72
But in my neighborhood a core liquor store industry was a winery

724
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:40.72
Yeah, so if you're looking at it from maybe from field walls perspective. Oh, yeah, he grew up like big time

725
00:56:40.72 --> 00:56:43.20
Oh, yeah, like a tease dude over here

726
00:56:43.20 --> 00:56:46.16
Huh, sling in that reeling

727
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:51.28
So this rich dude comes in he says something to you. He said something and that night

728
00:56:51.28 --> 00:56:56.64
I broke the margarita machine. I set that bitch on and broke it and I knew that call some probably about 600

729
00:56:57.36 --> 00:57:03.72
And I was in and I didn't go back there man and then I went back to LA and I was kind of yeah

730
00:57:03.72 --> 00:57:05.72
I didn't want to be

731
00:57:05.72 --> 00:57:10.000
Yeah, I couldn't commit to the relationship I was in and I just went back to LA and so

732
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.88
And then things like I started

733
00:57:13.92 --> 00:57:18.72
I don't know what happened then, but I started picking up some steam and that's when pot some podcasting started and

734
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:26.80
And I just was really fortunate man. You know my producer Nick Davis who's a great guy as a huge fan of yours

735
00:57:26.80 --> 00:57:32.24
And so you were gracious enough to come on and rogue and had me on his podcast at the same time and

736
00:57:32.88 --> 00:57:35.04
a couple of other little things happen where

737
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:39.64
Suddenly a kind of had a fan base. I don't know if there was much space in between

738
00:57:39.64 --> 00:57:41.84
Oh, I didn't Netflix special that didn't do anything

739
00:57:42.72 --> 00:57:47.08
Then wait, what came out first the net flick special it looks yeah, okay, so that thing came out

740
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:49.20
But it doesn't really matter no one really notices

741
00:57:49.20 --> 00:57:56.000
It did not the man. I was so excited. I remember I went to chat new gum all fired up and I'm thinking it's gonna be packed man

742
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.80
And it was a small it was even a big club and there was nine people in there

743
00:58:01.20 --> 00:58:03.20
So when stuff like that happens

744
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:08.56
That's got to be tough to power through. I mean when you're especially with everything you've said so far tonight

745
00:58:09.12 --> 00:58:14.22
About the one people laughter and approval and all this stuff and you really send that flick's piece

746
00:58:17.96 --> 00:58:19.96
And this is

747
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:26.04
Echo what do you think man? I'll say that for so many him echo you don't even repeat much

748
00:58:26.04 --> 00:58:28.04
Oh

749
00:58:36.04 --> 00:58:38.28
It's painful oh it's painful, bro

750
00:58:38.28 --> 00:58:41.48
But when painful here's a crazy thing about painful man

751
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:48.68
When most of what you know when your life feels like painful then I think shit like that just kind of fucking fits on the ship

752
00:58:48.68 --> 00:58:55.04
So how are you so for other people right because other people are having their chat and you go experience

753
00:58:55.04 --> 00:58:58.80
We're nine people show up there having you know whatever happened in their life. What did you do?

754
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:04.000
Because here's another thing when you you know we talk about Gary V and I've I people will assess this about me too

755
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Because it's like hard work hard work hard work and I just had this conversation with someone the other day

756
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.40
They're like you know yeah, my company hard work doesn't necessarily mean you get promoted

757
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:17.96
I'm like that's true everywhere hard work doesn't necessarily like you can't just expect

758
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:21.12
I'm just gonna work hard work hard work hard and that then things are just gonna happen

759
00:59:21.12 --> 00:59:26.56
If that if it was I hate to say if it was that easy and a lot more people do it not everyone do hard work

760
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:29.28
But a lot of people would do it a lot of people would start working hard

761
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:33.92
But you gotta have like you I'm sure you've seen comedians along the way that were really hard work

762
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:39.12
They're doing hey I wrote another 19 jokes and like and you read them and they all suck right?

763
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:44.64
So when you get done with this Netflix special you're all amped your expectations are so high

764
00:59:45.44 --> 00:59:47.44
You show up. There's no one there

765
00:59:47.44 --> 00:59:50.88
How do you how do you power through that how do you get through that what you do?

766
00:59:50.88 --> 00:59:54.16
I don't know I made out with this big dick girl. I remember that

767
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:59.84
Okay, bro can we get some like some a little bit more than thick girls making out okay?

768
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:02.40
I mean that's how uh

769
01:00:02.40 --> 01:00:05.20
Okay, you been there to be in from the islands or whatever

770
01:00:05.92 --> 01:00:10.48
So yeah, man. I mean it's like I freaking did it you know. I remember yeah

771
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:12.80
Well, that was it that was an interesting thing about comedy clubs

772
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:17.84
It's coming comes just a bar. It's a bar hook to a stage so it's like then there was always a couple

773
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:22.40
You could always get a couple drinks at the end of the night to kind of say shit yourself and I was never a big drink

774
01:00:22.40 --> 01:00:25.12
I'd have maybe two drinks you know, but um

775
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.80
But after that I don't know I started to get

776
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:36.000
You know I don't know really what happened. I just knew that that wasn't it that Holly oh somebody wrote an article

777
01:00:36.24 --> 01:00:39.52
I remember right when my special came out and

778
01:00:39.52 --> 01:00:42.96
It said like oh

779
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:46.88
This would be Donald Trump's favorite comedian or something. It was like a negative

780
01:00:46.88 --> 01:00:51.20
It was I think it was right around the time maybe when some of that campaigning was started or something

781
01:00:52.96 --> 01:01:00.16
And it was and a lot of my stuff is sarcasm like a character also it's me, but it's also this it's a

782
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.60
Our caricature of like where you're from right right it's a mix really

783
01:01:05.60 --> 01:01:10.48
Right and that made me really not trust any of like

784
01:01:10.96 --> 01:01:13.52
Hollywood tabloids any of that kind of shit so

785
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:20.80
And it just was so debilitating you works so hard and somebody just does something just completely errands and aimless you know

786
01:01:22.80 --> 01:01:25.60
When you watched your own Netflix special

787
01:01:26.40 --> 01:01:30.48
Will you like oh yeah, oh you kind of like damn oh you neutral

788
01:01:30.48 --> 01:01:32.48
I

789
01:01:32.48 --> 01:01:39.44
Feel okay about it. I felt like I went too fast during the material. I felt like I was probably a little nervous and went too fast

790
01:01:41.44 --> 01:01:44.24
So I never really looked back on it super fondly

791
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:51.92
But but then at that point things started to evolve in some podcasts and started going from my perspective

792
01:01:53.76 --> 01:02:00.000
So I didn't know who I didn't I this is it's funny because as I was like reading about your background and trying to figure out

793
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.80
Because I thought you just like everybody thinks I thought oh he just made it famous overnight or whatever

794
01:02:04.80 --> 01:02:11.52
That's kind of and I didn't as I researched I was like oh this dude's been doing comedy for like whatever two decades or a long time

795
01:02:11.52 --> 01:02:13.52
Yeah, I saw a long time and

796
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:16.96
There was a video it was free corner

797
01:02:17.44 --> 01:02:22.08
That little video that you made you know what I'm talking about free corner. Yeah, dude with that bus. Yeah, yeah

798
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:28.40
You that great-hand dude. Yeah, we just had a great-hand driver on the podcast man. I used to go around all the time

799
01:02:28.40 --> 01:02:33.24
I think I go in there somebody freaking somebody's like you want to see something and it's always their dick

800
01:02:33.24 --> 01:02:35.92
I know you don't understand bro. It's like come on bro

801
01:02:36.24 --> 01:02:41.60
So so the you do pull his dick out of a hat, you know like how you even get your dick in

802
01:02:41.60 --> 01:02:43.92
Yeah, you know, that's supposed to be a rabbit

803
01:02:44.64 --> 01:02:47.60
Just a lot of pretty shit magicians man out there, bro

804
01:02:47.60 --> 01:02:56.000
So I saw that thing and and just I was dying laughing I kind of shared it with all my friends because everyone kind of likes MMA and here

805
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.48
You were talking about you know bust and ever and kind of my generation did went on Greyhounds, right?

806
01:03:02.48 --> 01:03:07.60
So we kind of knew I don't think a lot any in California like no one takes public transit

807
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.08
So it's different but across the country man you've been to a Greyhound station or

808
01:03:12.08 --> 01:03:17.68
Or you've seen some you know you've seen some shit man in your life if you've been to Greyhound

809
01:03:17.68 --> 01:03:22.08
You've been to a girl. Yeah, dude. I saw a lady drinking a can of

810
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:25.60
Baby formula dude

811
01:03:25.60 --> 01:03:31.36
Simple apple. Yeah, you said that on that video. I didn't even know I didn't like what I thought it was some kind of

812
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:32.000
True

813
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.20
I

814
01:03:33.20 --> 01:03:37.04
That's making me think I had a Google it man. So so you did that

815
01:03:37.04 --> 01:03:42.72
You go on rogan for the first time and this is what I want to say is that when

816
01:03:43.76 --> 01:03:47.36
I think you had like a or you have and still have like a

817
01:03:48.56 --> 01:03:57.28
Like a full of vulnerability and honesty about yourself that I think is really different and I think that

818
01:03:57.92 --> 01:04:02.72
That is what makes people make makes people made me the first time I heard y'all's like oh, yeah, he's not

819
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:09.36
He's exposing himself, you know not in it's not in the way that your friends do whatever the flashers are that you're hanging out with but

820
01:04:09.60 --> 01:04:13.04
Exposing yourself. I'm not saying you were on a text like a

821
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:15.60
You know support

822
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:23.84
But yes, so I think that was a huge thing that I think a lot of people connected as soon as they kind of heard you and heard you talking to Joe

823
01:04:24.24 --> 01:04:30.40
And and freaking Joe. I mean obviously his his podcast is so massive and and he's such a good guy

824
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:35.68
And you know was telling everyone oh, yeah, this guy's hilarious. I mean I remember he told I think you told me

825
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.88
Yeah, he did he was like well, if that's guys freaking hilarious. You know how's like hey, do you be seeing this similar act

826
01:04:40.88 --> 01:04:44.16
Bang or whatever whatever brought it up he's like oh, I guys hilarious

827
01:04:44.72 --> 01:04:48.24
So so then you when did you start your podcast? I

828
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:55.20
Started I did a podcast with a friend for about probably two years that was about more like interviewing people that was in Hollywood

829
01:04:55.28 --> 01:04:59.84
My friend worked at TMZ and we tried a podcast together and it was fun

830
01:04:59.84 --> 01:05:03.04
But I didn't get to be myself. I had to like it was more interviewing

831
01:05:03.68 --> 01:05:09.36
You know and I didn't really like that as much and so then once at one day I walked out of Rogans and I said

832
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:12.56
I need to do something more like that

833
01:05:12.56 --> 01:05:20.24
I didn't know that that's I don't think I knew until I was there and hands on in the environment that that's the way you could do it

834
01:05:20.64 --> 01:05:23.76
Even by listening I didn't get the concept a hundred percent

835
01:05:23.76 --> 01:05:28.56
And then I walked out of it. I need to do something more like that

836
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:36.64
And so I just started then I started one of my kitchen and just started kind of talking about stuff and things that I was thinking about and uh

837
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:40.40
And yeah, and it's been

838
01:05:41.36 --> 01:05:46.72
Yeah, it's been a it's been a place sometimes where I share maybe more than I should sometimes and I don't realize it

839
01:05:48.24 --> 01:05:49.92
It's been a lot of different things man

840
01:05:49.92 --> 01:05:52.80
Um sometimes it's been a blessing because it's the

841
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:57.28
It's like that thing that keeps me going each week. It's like a guaranteed thing

842
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:04.56
You know the longest relationship I've had in my life sometimes is with my podcast and a lot of ways. It's the one thing that I'll show up for every week even

843
01:06:05.44 --> 01:06:07.44
um

844
01:06:09.20 --> 01:06:13.04
Even on times I noticed like why don't feel good like the past maybe two years I haven't felt really good

845
01:06:13.04 --> 01:06:18.48
Something's I think physically kind of I don't know what it is. I'm doing like a lot of blood work and doing all these different therapies and like

846
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:23.28
Trying to kind of figure out why don't feel as good as I used to I physically don't feel good

847
01:06:24.40 --> 01:06:25.60
So

848
01:06:25.60 --> 01:06:31.04
The hardest thing sometimes is we don't feel good to go in a into an environment and put yourself out. It's like

849
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.32
You almost want to hide from people you don't feel you want to wait to you feel okay to get out there and like you know

850
01:06:37.92 --> 01:06:42.80
So that's been one of the most challenging things is on weeks where I don't really feel that great

851
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:46.88
To put myself out put myself right there

852
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:50.96
It's like you just sometimes you like man. I don't want to see people to see me not in my best

853
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:53.76
Especially when

854
01:06:53.76 --> 01:06:58.96
The only thing I've always had is my own image how you see me. It's like it's it makes it real dicey sometimes

855
01:06:58.96 --> 01:07:02.16
But at the same time man. I've learned a lot about people through

856
01:07:02.72 --> 01:07:10.000
Podcasts and you know I'm just enamored to none of the people that come out and the sweet the release nice stories that they share you know

857
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.96
Uh, um, and then people will share stuff with me that mean something to them sometimes like

858
01:07:17.68 --> 01:07:22.08
Some guy came up to me this morning at the cafe and said hey man. I got five years over you know and

859
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:28.48
And you just so excited when you see how somebody's life gets different or better and

860
01:07:29.52 --> 01:07:35.68
Not that I have anything to do with that. I don't feel like I do but just that he wants to share that with me and then he feels okay share and you know

861
01:07:35.68 --> 01:07:37.68
Um

862
01:07:38.08 --> 01:07:40.08
Things like that man. It's

863
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:47.28
That's one thing I've learned I think through podcast and is really a power in kind of

864
01:07:48.48 --> 01:07:52.80
Even though it's not real human connection. It's not the hand-to-hand combat of

865
01:07:53.60 --> 01:07:56.64
Of human connection because we're through microphones and stuff

866
01:07:58.32 --> 01:08:03.04
It's been surprising to me how many people connect you know and how many people feel and

867
01:08:03.04 --> 01:08:07.84
How much feelings you can get through stuff. It's it's pretty remarkable sometimes

868
01:08:08.40 --> 01:08:11.12
So anyway, I don't really know what I'm talking about but

869
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:16.56
Yeah, it's interesting because you were made it you know you're joking around earlier about how

870
01:08:17.04 --> 01:08:23.20
You know you're sorry, not being funny right now on this podcast or supposed and that's what's interesting about that is

871
01:08:24.40 --> 01:08:27.92
You you have some pretty serious stuff that you do on your podcast. You have some you know

872
01:08:27.92 --> 01:08:33.52
You kind of sometimes you open up about stuff and how you feeling and it maybe it's not feeling that good and

873
01:08:34.24 --> 01:08:38.48
And again, I think that people tune into that because look man if I

874
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:43.92
Guess I guess you could try and like fake being funny or fake being in a good mood

875
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:49.28
But I don't think you can really fake it 100% where people really believe it and I think it's better that you

876
01:08:49.92 --> 01:08:54.24
Just be who you are and and you know if you got something if you're not if you feel like

877
01:08:54.24 --> 01:09:00.80
Freaking depressed or whatever then you're like hey, this is what I feel like right now and it makes people

878
01:09:01.04 --> 01:09:06.96
comfortable that there's someone like you who's usually funny and it seems to have a pretty good life and all

879
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:12.08
But something like hey man, this is freaking hard right now for whatever reason whatever that reason right might be and

880
01:09:13.04 --> 01:09:15.04
You know I think

881
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:17.04
when people

882
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:22.40
Just knowing that someone else is kind of like bear with them. It's really a shirt. Yeah

883
01:09:22.40 --> 01:09:28.000
And the other thing that's interesting about this is you've been saying this whole time you know that you have a hard time with

884
01:09:29.44 --> 01:09:33.36
Relationships and long-term and all this but how long you've been doing your podcast for

885
01:09:34.16 --> 01:09:37.36
For maybe five years so five years and

886
01:09:37.92 --> 01:09:40.80
This is the thing about podcast and I have the same thing where

887
01:09:41.44 --> 01:09:44.24
I meet people that listen to podcasts and

888
01:09:45.12 --> 01:09:49.60
They feel like we have a relationship. Yeah, and they're right right because

889
01:09:49.60 --> 01:09:54.96
You don't get you don't you don't I mean my podcast is three four five hours long

890
01:09:55.60 --> 01:09:58.000
I don't think it now I see what happened to you

891
01:09:59.20 --> 01:10:01.60
Yeah, you said things probably years ago

892
01:10:02.40 --> 01:10:05.92
And there's just not much in there. I bet if we tickle you get a mouth

893
01:10:06.48 --> 01:10:08.48
Creep

894
01:10:08.48 --> 01:10:15.12
How often do you sit down and talk to anyone for three hours or two hours? I walked out of your room and I remember

895
01:10:15.12 --> 01:10:18.72
Tell him I said hey that's the longest conversation I've ever had in my life with anybody

896
01:10:18.72 --> 01:10:20.72
It's best you with a man

897
01:10:20.72 --> 01:10:24.56
Like I didn't have any male figure. I had you know there was no male

898
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:31.04
Figures in my neighborhood one got shot up a ready-made 24 hour clinic and that was like the toughest do we knit?

899
01:10:31.60 --> 01:10:34.88
You know and he was on pill so he wasn't even really doing it out of his own heart

900
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:38.64
so you know we didn't have a lot of uh

901
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:46.16
So I think yes, I've found more probably male influences through podcasting

902
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:51.76
Then anywhere else in my life really which is kind of interesting

903
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:56.56
You know

904
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:02.48
And sometimes uh yeah, I don't know podcast and powerful and here's one thing that's neat too Jaco is I mostly meet people

905
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:05.36
Who I would like to meet anyway

906
01:11:05.36 --> 01:11:10.40
Hmm it's like they got it came up to me this morning. You know I would like to meet him in you know like

907
01:11:11.04 --> 01:11:13.04
He was some people's

908
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:21.44
Like I did reach some reality tell was when I was younger you know for a couple years on TV and I would meet people that I didn't know anything about me

909
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:23.44
Just people that see you and

910
01:11:23.92 --> 01:11:27.20
That was just there was nothing to it that meant anything really

911
01:11:28.40 --> 01:11:29.68
So

912
01:11:29.68 --> 01:11:30.88
To meet people where you you

913
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:35.60
They know you somewhat and you so you would have some common ground, you know

914
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:38.16
It's really nice almost it

915
01:11:38.40 --> 01:11:42.64
That's one thing it's interesting man. I feel like God has given me this weird way where it's like

916
01:11:45.92 --> 01:11:47.92
He

917
01:11:48.40 --> 01:11:52.72
He always is trying to show me that people care about me, you know because I think for so long

918
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:57.60
I didn't feel like anybody did you know when I was real real young and I'm not complaining and you know

919
01:11:57.60 --> 01:12:01.76
I'm not complaining about it. I'm not I don't need any self pity. I don't need anything like that

920
01:12:05.68 --> 01:12:07.68
But I do think it's fascinating how

921
01:12:09.12 --> 01:12:12.56
You know he'll send people in every you know every now and then somebody says something

922
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:19.92
No, I just something it's like it's just slow healing of this space inside of me that was just has been uncomfortable for a long time

923
01:12:20.64 --> 01:12:25.12
You know and so there's powerful stuff like that going on, you know so

924
01:12:25.12 --> 01:12:30.96
And and and and sometimes I can do that for other people you know I know a friend of mine

925
01:12:32.80 --> 01:12:34.80
He's in the military. I think his dad had some

926
01:12:36.32 --> 01:12:40.40
Well, I probably should talk about my talking on a shop, but yeah, it's just I don't know

927
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:43.20
I don't know man

928
01:12:43.20 --> 01:12:46.80
I'm enjoying being alive these days a lot more because I want to see what else

929
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:50.96
Can unfold you know and I don't know if I always felt like that as a kid

930
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:58.000
I felt like more like every day was a battle, you know where is now I'm like man every there's there's a lot of good stuff out there

931
01:12:58.08 --> 01:13:04.96
You know and I can be a part of it whether it's for me or somebody else if I can just do my best to take care of myself and

932
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:07.36
Keep myself

933
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:10.80
I don't even have to win every day, but do if I can just show up and get a strong tie dog

934
01:13:12.24 --> 01:13:14.24
If I can even fucking tip a judge fam

935
01:13:14.24 --> 01:13:21.04
I'm saying dog and pull out that dirty w dog, you know then it's possible and I wish Darren Till would know lost honestly

936
01:13:22.40 --> 01:13:24.40
No homo bro

937
01:13:25.36 --> 01:13:27.36
Speaking of

938
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:31.36
Fighting what about your jitter where you're at I haven't gone to probably about two and a half months

939
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:34.16
I just kept getting hurt so bad who are you training with man?

940
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:37.60
You got to get fine somebody that's gonna be a little bit more relaxed when I train with you

941
01:13:37.60 --> 01:13:42.88
Oh dude, I'm training with locals bro dude and I was one strike white belt man

942
01:13:42.88 --> 01:13:47.28
And last time I even left because I couldn't find park and dude, so that's kind of why I'm at right now

943
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.76
That's not that

944
01:13:49.76 --> 01:13:50.72
That is not a good thing

945
01:13:50.72 --> 01:13:53.76
I've been taking a lot of yoga because some of it was my flexibility and

946
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:59.68
And I kept getting hurt so bad like for me anywhere I couldn't like I need to do comedy

947
01:13:59.68 --> 01:14:03.04
I was getting ready we just taped a Netflix special it's coming out in October

948
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:06.72
this when I'm proud about I felt excited

949
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:11.36
This one is more of a reflection. I feel like of

950
01:14:11.36 --> 01:14:17.28
Just more of a confident me as a comedian. You know, so what what goes into?

951
01:14:18.16 --> 01:14:21.04
What goes into that how long does it take to get ready?

952
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:28.56
Who contacts you like what's happened if if echo Charles was gonna do a Netflix special what would it look like

953
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:30.32
How long would it take what do we do?

954
01:14:30.32 --> 01:14:33.92
Corribbean I would bet you know Bill offense dude you could be from New York

955
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:40.72
But I would probably do yeah something maybe tropical you know it was some ocean sounds in the back

956
01:14:41.36 --> 01:14:45.44
You know maybe get that Viet and me's got to go by drinking that cranberry on the skateboard

957
01:14:46.40 --> 01:14:51.04
You know I would get it kind of you know maybe slightly urban you know maybe somebody playing you know

958
01:14:51.04 --> 01:14:53.84
Maybe a dog up near a chaint length fence and the bat

959
01:14:55.44 --> 01:14:58.24
And then if you can't tell that I would sing dude, I think you would enjoy that

960
01:14:59.44 --> 01:15:02.40
There's something I'm watching a strong man saying dude it's pretty powerful

961
01:15:02.40 --> 01:15:05.76
It's kind of like jewel, but for people in sterile

962
01:15:07.12 --> 01:15:09.12
Studying the rain

963
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:11.36
You're always crazy like that

964
01:15:12.72 --> 01:15:14.72
What do you ask him out?

965
01:15:14.72 --> 01:15:19.36
Netflix special so you got a net of the special coming out so this is what last one maybe you say you didn't feel

966
01:15:19.36 --> 01:15:24.96
100% on this one you feel 100% this one I feel a lot better what made you feel but what made how do you prepare for it?

967
01:15:25.60 --> 01:15:29.44
Well one thing I did stop doing was due to just because I kept my ribs kept getting cracked

968
01:15:29.44 --> 01:15:35.36
So I mean it was just I mean dude you couldn't do any yoga so when I don't do physical things to take care of myself

969
01:15:35.36 --> 01:15:37.36
I start mentally feeling bad

970
01:15:37.36 --> 01:15:42.40
Keep point by the way keep point for everybody you just heard it from Theo if you

971
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:46.92
If you can't do physical stuff you're gonna start feeling bad mentally facts

972
01:15:47.28 --> 01:15:53.84
So go do physical stuff. Yeah, I have to and it's not even fair for me any more to evaluate myself sometimes

973
01:15:53.84 --> 01:15:58.80
If I haven't been physically active because I'm not giving myself a fair chance really

974
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:01.36
You know I have to be able to take care of myself

975
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.52
I have to be able to be thinking with a brain that's you know healthy so

976
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.28
Yes, so I noticed that but anyway they gave us a budget and we made and

977
01:16:10.96 --> 01:16:17.12
I wanted to I wanted to do one where I felt like this one is gonna I'm gonna do I'm gonna do right

978
01:16:17.12 --> 01:16:24.48
And I got to hire the production production company and I've gotten to go through the editing more and it's been tedious

979
01:16:24.48 --> 01:16:30.08
But the the months before it I had a yoga instructor coming to my home every couple of days

980
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:34.96
I was doing I had a weight trainer I had a weight trainer

981
01:16:35.68 --> 01:16:39.60
I was doing a lot of stuff to take care of myself, you know

982
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:46.000
And where'd you dig for the material the material I bought I had about six years to get some good material

983
01:16:46.32 --> 01:16:50.80
The hard part was COVID it was so fresh at 2019 the material was ready to go

984
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:53.36
You know it was just like a damn

985
01:16:54.56 --> 01:16:58.72
I mean it was really just like a damn newborn like a strong newborn

986
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:01.20
You know I'm saying one that fucking elbow crawls out

987
01:17:01.60 --> 01:17:04.08
You know with a can of freaking go in a car

988
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:08.72
I know I said they kind of baby that beats mom

989
01:17:09.28 --> 01:17:15.20
Okay, like this thing was ready to go this thing was ten months in the this thing was I go to make

990
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:20.16
Um, and then COVID hits and then COVID hit so then you have all this down time

991
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:26.000
So I did move to Nashville and bought I bought a home in Nashville and because the stage was still open

992
01:17:26.48 --> 01:17:28.96
So I could still go and keep this material fresh enough

993
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:35.68
And then I did a couple weeks in LA because there's a lot of stage time there

994
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:44.48
Um about six weeks ago I went there for a few weeks and got it ready and then put it down and put it down in Nashville and

995
01:17:45.20 --> 01:17:50.72
It was great man. We had like 6,000 people came out damn and uh that's massive for comedy isn't it?

996
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:56.48
It's pretty good we did three shows of 2000. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, I don't yeah otherwise it would be too big

997
01:17:56.80 --> 01:18:00.000
This venue was just kind of real perfect enough to rhyme and over there and

998
01:18:01.60 --> 01:18:03.60
Yeah, so it was good man

999
01:18:03.60 --> 01:18:06.40
And it was good and I involved myself more in the editing

1000
01:18:06.64 --> 01:18:10.64
You know, I've seen a lot of the ropes now. I know when I can assert myself and

1001
01:18:11.76 --> 01:18:15.20
Sometimes I don't do it that well, sometimes I'm too aggressive. Do they record all the shows?

1002
01:18:15.84 --> 01:18:18.64
The first one was so bad it was like people were haggling

1003
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:22.72
We built a set that literally looked like a pedophiles

1004
01:18:23.20 --> 01:18:28.08
Like a pedophile it opened a candy shop do that's how it was okay. Like this is on purpose

1005
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:30.64
No

1006
01:18:30.64 --> 01:18:33.76
Now great question

1007
01:18:35.52 --> 01:18:36.72
And you still don't say anything

1008
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:41.12
You know you could listen at home, man

1009
01:18:41.12 --> 01:18:43.36
Okay, you're making people uncomfortable

1010
01:18:44.72 --> 01:18:48.64
I'm just joking bro. He's a like a nice guy. I'm just just joking but I don't want to make it

1011
01:18:48.64 --> 01:18:50.64
So you make this

1012
01:18:50.64 --> 01:18:54.64
And it looked bad bro. I got there. I was so angry when I saw the set

1013
01:18:55.84 --> 01:18:59.44
Because I didn't make it somebody that I paid somebody what make it what was the goal of this set

1014
01:18:59.44 --> 01:19:03.44
It was supposed to the back of the rhyme and has these beautiful windows and

1015
01:19:04.80 --> 01:19:09.92
We wanted to make the windows on stage. He's colorful kind of church churchy churchy kind of windows

1016
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:14.72
And we didn't do it. It looked like so did they change it that night?

1017
01:19:14.72 --> 01:19:18.24
It looked like a gingerbread house dude for John Wayne Dacy

1018
01:19:18.24 --> 01:19:24.32
It was like as if he had entered a sweet G-B-G-B house contest for he freaking got busted

1019
01:19:25.28 --> 01:19:27.28
if he did it

1020
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:29.28
Who if he did it?

1021
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:31.68
But it was so bad bro

1022
01:19:31.68 --> 01:19:35.20
Even the next day the guy came we call him was like get these fucking things out of here

1023
01:19:35.20 --> 01:19:39.76
And I took one of the way to his through it out of the floor over the railing outside pieces shit

1024
01:19:40.32 --> 01:19:43.28
I mean a kid could make it look like a kid school thing

1025
01:19:44.08 --> 01:19:48.48
So the next night we just went with a flat curtain red curtain and uh

1026
01:19:49.20 --> 01:19:52.40
And we carpeted the stage was just a little interesting. I've never done that

1027
01:19:52.40 --> 01:19:59.20
It's just a little bit kind of explosive to take the reflection off of the stage so it would give us a better lighting out some better lighting opportunities

1028
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:04.80
And then they record them all and they recorded them all yeah and then you

1029
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:11.12
Depending on which night you did the best you might take a chunk from here and a chunk from there. That's pretty much how you put it together

1030
01:20:11.12 --> 01:20:14.72
It pretty much about and you know we just did like two-thirds from one show and one third from another

1031
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:19.44
The crowd was much better the second night. We had to get the tell the people have security

1032
01:20:19.44 --> 01:20:24.72
You know or just have some control over the audience and people wanted to be helpful, you know

1033
01:20:25.44 --> 01:20:27.44
And also the

1034
01:20:28.88 --> 01:20:33.12
Netflix hit us a couple days before and said everybody has to have a test or a PCR

1035
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:35.76
You know or whatever

1036
01:20:35.76 --> 01:20:38.56
PPCR yeah so that was

1037
01:20:39.92 --> 01:20:45.12
And I'm just grateful to everybody that came out whether they got a test or made a fake car wherever the hell they did

1038
01:20:45.12 --> 01:20:51.28
And a lot of people went and got the test man and it just it's just so nice you know

1039
01:20:52.64 --> 01:20:57.76
It just it just was it's just so nice to go spend an extra half hour the day before you're gonna go to a show

1040
01:20:58.56 --> 01:21:01.04
Could go and do something because you care enough man

1041
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:04.000
Yeah

1042
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.36
Well that's awesome

1043
01:21:05.36 --> 01:21:12.000

It's always nice man. It's been a blessing and this whole you little universe is a blessing and thanks for coming through with those

1054
01:21:52.16 --> 01:21:54.16
Dimes you brought in last night

1055
01:21:54.88 --> 01:21:56.56
That's my wife and daughter bro take

1056
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:04.32
Because you mentioned because you mentioned you were crazy boys at a paranoia about getting murdered

1057
01:22:05.44 --> 01:22:07.44
You can go down

1058
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:12.72
We're looking at a video. They ever have this to you dude. I will stay far away from them

1059
01:22:12.72 --> 01:22:13.52
Even then

1060
01:22:13.52 --> 01:22:15.76
She that no beautiful ladies was nice to see

1061
01:22:16.40 --> 01:22:20.64
Obviously they love you and it was just nice to see a little part of your life man. It made me feel

1062
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:26.24
It's just inspiring you know when I see other people doing the things that are like seeing like the hardest thing for me to do

1063
01:22:26.64 --> 01:22:29.84
To build from our future. It's like every time you see it like

1064
01:22:30.64 --> 01:22:31.84
It just

1065
01:22:31.84 --> 01:22:35.60
It makes things feel a little bit more feasible or that I know if I need help

1066
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:39.28
I can ask you or I can ask other people that I know care so

1067
01:22:39.92 --> 01:22:44.24
It was it was nice. I appreciate you coming now. Well, it's definitely feasible. Who's a great show?

1068
01:22:44.56 --> 01:22:47.04
Appreciate you being out there. Appreciate you making everyone laugh

1069
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:51.36
I can already see we're gonna have to do this again. We have a little bit more time. Yeah, with low-to-home

1070
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:54.80
Sorry I have to go I'm thinking five hours next time but what I do I don't know

1071
01:22:56.40 --> 01:23:00.56
I don't know man, but we got live I would love to talk more about the stuff and talk more about

1072
01:23:00.56 --> 01:23:06.24
Um, other things hopefully I have some more BJJ training when I come back so that would be something nice to talk about

1073
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:11.28
Awesome man. Let's get you out of here brother. Echo. Thank you nice to meet you brother. Yeah, you too. Oh, you said it, huh?

1074
01:23:11.84 --> 01:23:13.28
The

1075
01:23:13.28 --> 01:23:20.40
You know how you thought you mentioned her like you'll run into people and you'll actually have like a little bit of a connection with them

1076
01:23:21.04 --> 01:23:23.04
Is do you think that

1077
01:23:23.76 --> 01:23:27.92
Like you know how you share stuff openly more than a lot of people I think

1078
01:23:27.92 --> 01:23:31.52
Do you think that that is an indicator that you're doing the right thing?

1079
01:23:33.52 --> 01:23:37.52
Because sometimes like okay, so let's say if you're in the public like

1080
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:44.32
And people will approach or whatever I think sometimes they can like miss represent who you are

1081
01:23:44.32 --> 01:23:48.72
They're like oh, yeah, maybe like they feel like they know you got a podcast all this stuff and then when they

1082
01:23:49.12 --> 01:23:54.88
The things they say or they try to like relate to you whatever the like they're just way off a lot of the time I think

1083
01:23:54.88 --> 01:24:02.48
Not not necessarily my sometimes it can be you know, but the fact that like a random quote and quote random stranger can come up to you

1084
01:24:02.48 --> 01:24:06.40
And then you guys can relate like on a significant like kind of deep level

1085
01:24:06.40 --> 01:24:12.40
It's just so quickly get there. That's one thing that's fascinating. I mean you could have a moment where you're having a real moment with somebody

1086
01:24:12.64 --> 01:24:15.44
Like a moment that makes you feel something inside of yourself

1087
01:24:16.24 --> 01:24:17.44
You know

1088
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:20.16
And that's real that that to me comes from somewhere else

1089
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:29.12
Yeah, it always like you always struck me as someone who's like so authentic and I think that that that is a big indicator that you're doing the right thing

1090
01:24:29.12 --> 01:24:33.60
If you can really like relate to people who you never met before that quickly

1091
01:24:35.20 --> 01:24:43.04
Yeah, thanks man. Uh, yeah, I just I think for feeling so disc it's a lot of it's so new to me feeling connection

1092
01:24:43.04 --> 01:24:47.04
And so it's fucking like being on a bridge at shakes, you know

1093
01:24:47.04 --> 01:24:52.64
I don't know what you guys call that and you know, we usually call that a bridge the shake

1094
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:57.20
Yeah, but if we do say that sounds people are technical

1095
01:24:57.68 --> 01:24:59.68
It's telling people believe it, okay

1096
01:25:00.32 --> 01:25:04.32
Um, but yeah, for me a lot of that stuff is just I'm a late

1097
01:25:05.12 --> 01:25:09.36
I'm a late bloomer and a lot of like kind of I think emotional kind of ways honestly

1098
01:25:10.80 --> 01:25:12.80
And I'm not ashamed of it or anything like that

1099
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:17.12
You know, um, but it's not on's in a world where you want to be tougher

1100
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:20.88
You know, it's it's uh, it feels

1101
01:25:21.92 --> 01:25:24.88
It feels tough to sometimes learn later in life

1102
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:27.84
But yeah, I think it's nice and sometimes I don't know what

1103
01:25:29.04 --> 01:25:31.04
Roll God is using me for you know

1104
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.88
You know and I just want to try and keep myself the best

1105
01:25:36.48 --> 01:25:40.48
In the best way that I can so he can use me for the best, you know like um

1106
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:46.56
And I really I really believe that, you know, and I don't mean it in a way like I'm some kind of hero or anything

1107
01:25:46.56 --> 01:25:48.56
I just

1108
01:25:48.80 --> 01:25:52.80
You know if I can take care of myself well, I believe and I believe this for anybody that he that

1109
01:25:53.52 --> 01:25:58.96
Or you aren't your higher power doesn't it could be whatever your higher power is can use you for good, you know

1110
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:03.44
And we need more good out there and we need each other, you know

1111
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:06.72
Anyway, I sound like a fucking weirdo dog. Do I sound like a weirdo?

1112
01:26:06.72 --> 01:26:12.88
Kind of okay. Sorry. You mean you go? No man. I think I think I think I go spot on it's kind of kind of mimics or or

1113
01:26:13.52 --> 01:26:19.44
Reinforces what I was saying earlier. I think the reason that you're popular right now is because you

1114
01:26:19.84 --> 01:26:25.68
Review yourself because you're open and I think people you're you're real person and I think people connect to that and

1115
01:26:25.92 --> 01:26:30.000
And I think it's awesome because I think it allows people to connect to themselves

1116
01:26:30.48 --> 01:26:32.08
So I say

1117
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:36.08
Keep doing what you're doing. Theo Vaughn. I appreciate a man and I appreciate you guys have me man

1118
01:26:36.08 --> 01:26:40.56
I really do it's good. It's made me feel excited like I'm doing the right thing. I don't know bro gang maybe

1119
01:26:42.56 --> 01:26:44.56
And with that

1120
01:26:44.56 --> 01:26:47.36
Mr. Theo Vaughn has left the building. Yes

1121
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:50.56
He had to go bad planning on my part

1122
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:55.28
He had a tight window. I should have gotten him in here earlier

1123
01:26:55.92 --> 01:26:57.76
Didn't didn't make that adjustments. We had a bail

1124
01:26:58.80 --> 01:27:02.24
But we're gonna back he's fired up to come back

1125
01:27:02.24 --> 01:27:06.08
Seems like we were just kind of getting into some good stuff. You know so

1126
01:27:08.32 --> 01:27:10.32
With that it is good that Theo

1127
01:27:11.60 --> 01:27:17.84
Is you know he's on the path he's working trying to get better trying to be better trying to stay on the path sober

1128
01:27:18.24 --> 01:27:20.24
Clean fitness

1129
01:27:20.24 --> 01:27:23.04
What was he talking about yoga like the whole nine yards?

1130
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:30.48
Some self assessment going on self assessment happening. There was some good stuff in there actually that he just sort of like mentioned

1131
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:32.48
Yeah, and I was like wait wait wait

1132
01:27:33.60 --> 01:27:41.12
We could talk what I didn't want to interrupt obviously, but there's um when he mentioned the thing about your behavior in your thoughts

1133
01:27:41.84 --> 01:27:45.04
Like your thoughts and actions. Yeah, so your actions

1134
01:27:45.84 --> 01:27:52.72
Lead your thoughts your thoughts. Yeah, yeah, yeah the other way around doesn't doesn't I would say if I was to assess that statement

1135
01:27:53.68 --> 01:27:55.68
I agree

1136
01:27:55.68 --> 01:27:57.68
Your actions can lead to your thoughts

1137
01:27:57.68 --> 01:28:02.24
I would say more often than your thoughts lead to actions because let's face it

1138
01:28:02.48 --> 01:28:09.02
Gotta have some thoughts to come up with what you're gonna do. Yeah, but there's a huge huge

1139
01:28:09.92 --> 01:28:11.20
Space

1140
01:28:11.20 --> 01:28:13.52
Between having a thought and taking action

1141
01:28:13.52 --> 01:28:16.16
You can close up that space you're gonna meet a lot better position

1142
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:21.56
Yeah, and he and it felt like you talk about so many very specific like like basically

1143
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.36
It's essentially like take action, you know, yeah

1144
01:28:25.36 --> 01:28:32.72
Rather than just going around in your head and Tim Ferris, I think yeah, Tim Ferris said that too

1145
01:28:32.72 --> 01:28:37.92
We're essentially the different way to say it, but the exact same thing is like get out of your head and into your body

1146
01:28:37.92 --> 01:28:42.56
Yeah, and he meant and Tim mentioned that specifically around like getting out of depression

1147
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:44.88
But then what feel is saying is if he's not

1148
01:28:45.84 --> 01:28:48.16
Physically moving and doing work physically

1149
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:53.28
He's gonna be in a bad place mentally. So yeah, you're right to say same thing same thing same cake

1150
01:28:53.28 --> 01:28:55.28
It's for sure

1151
01:28:55.28 --> 01:28:59.60
Unless there's a lot of stuff. Yes, you can follow up on the Wii. I can follow up on with you

1152
01:29:00.24 --> 01:29:03.52
And I will be looking forward to that nonetheless in the meantime

1153
01:29:03.92 --> 01:29:08.000
But we're all on this path together. I think I feel like it. I feel like we're all sort of

1154
01:29:08.88 --> 01:29:12.32
When we look up we see other people on the path with us

1155
01:29:13.12 --> 01:29:15.36
Good feeling it's good feeling so

1156
01:29:16.72 --> 01:29:18.72
I was doing some thinking

1157
01:29:18.72 --> 01:29:20.72
about the

1158
01:29:20.72 --> 01:29:28.32
These okay, so you when you created juggle fuel you essentially made the path pretty luxurious

1159
01:29:28.56 --> 01:29:33.28
Because think of only you can think about like how it was versus how it is now right? Yeah, okay

1160
01:29:34.40 --> 01:29:37.36
I mean, yes, you are right. Yeah, maybe luxury

1161
01:29:37.36 --> 01:29:41.04
Series is not my favorite word. No, I know you maybe have that lingering in your brain from

1162
01:29:41.60 --> 01:29:45.68
Theo von being on here because he and I had had a conversation on his podcast about

1163
01:29:45.68 --> 01:29:54.48
Luxury days, right? Yeah, okay, so the the way to put it as far as how you called it one time couple times

1164
01:29:54.48 --> 01:30:02.56
I was efficient. Yeah, it's exactly right like it's kind of like the logistics part of a of a battle or a war or something right where it's like

1165
01:30:03.60 --> 01:30:09.92
Oh, yeah, you want these cool new shoes that comfort your feet or whatever. I don't know that's for

1166
01:30:09.92 --> 01:30:16.96
For example, I think of but you're like no, it's not that I need to be coddled my feet like my feet are in good shape

1167
01:30:17.20 --> 01:30:19.68
But I can do a lot more running lot more rocking

1168
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:30.32
Lot more marching. Yep, seems same so you're you kind of took that approach. Yeah to the path you'll be more efficient even though technically speaking to support your

1169
01:30:31.52 --> 01:30:32.56
perspective

1170
01:30:32.56 --> 01:30:34.16
if you have

1171
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:36.56
good boots for

1172
01:30:36.56 --> 01:30:38.56
rocking yeah

1173
01:30:38.56 --> 01:30:43.28
They are technically will make you more efficient and in some way

1174
01:30:43.68 --> 01:30:50.16
That is somewhat luxurious compared to a piece of junk boots that are or bare feet or bare feet even down

1175
01:30:50.32 --> 01:30:51.92
but

1176
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:56.64
One could think of it in terms of all this is gonna these bare feet is gonna make my feet tougher

1177
01:30:57.92 --> 01:30:59.92
When you say one could think of it

1178
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:07.60
Is that cousin high school there they're telling you you shouldn't use you the proverbial humor in a sentence

1179
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:09.60
It's

1180
01:31:09.60 --> 01:31:11.60
Sure, yeah, I

1181
01:31:11.60 --> 01:31:17.20
Think I got it from flight club actually to be honest. What do they say in flight club? I think he said on the plane

1182
01:31:17.20 --> 01:31:20.64
He said one could make all types of explosives using

1183
01:31:22.16 --> 01:31:27.52
Ordinary household items and then the other guy said really if one were so inclined

1184
01:31:29.44 --> 01:31:31.44
So it's like I'm not saying me

1185
01:31:31.44 --> 01:31:40.56
Okay, I'm saying me, but I'm not saying well it's interesting. That's where you got cuz I went to college and I studied English in college and you you aren't supposed you

1186
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:43.76
aren't supposed to say

1187
01:31:44.48 --> 01:31:48.40
This is you should do this or you should do that you are supposed to say

1188
01:31:49.04 --> 01:31:53.92
One should say one is supposed to this. Oh, so right right. I don't know to me it

1189
01:31:54.48 --> 01:32:00.96
It's the language evolves. Yep English evolves and I think we're evolving to a point and I think I evolved to a point

1190
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:03.84
Where I say you right and I mean you you

1191
01:32:05.04 --> 01:32:07.60
Yeah, so in that that's actually good. Okay

1192
01:32:08.56 --> 01:32:10.56
That's kind of a good point

1193
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:15.44
In general because Ben and I said this before where it's it's baffling

1194
01:32:16.48 --> 01:32:20.40
How good we can communicate, but when you think about this all kind of this is the words you say the tone

1195
01:32:20.64 --> 01:32:24.16
Byling of like all this stuff is all command a certain message so if you're like hey

1196
01:32:24.56 --> 01:32:27.76
You'll tell you what you should do is do this and then there's all kinds of

1197
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:33.68
Like things that you imply when you say you you don't really mean you should do this

1198
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:39.36
You mean you mean a person should do this or whatever and I know that but if I don't know that

1199
01:32:39.68 --> 01:32:44.32
I'll be like tell me what I should you don't know what I should and shouldn't do so there's a I

1200
01:32:45.20 --> 01:32:49.36
You have you specifically aquatronics have a really good point and that's why

1201
01:32:50.24 --> 01:32:52.24
The English language

1202
01:32:52.24 --> 01:32:59.20
Technically in the highest level you should be I should be saying one should be saying one instead of you

1203
01:33:00.80 --> 01:33:02.80
So if one

1204
01:33:04.24 --> 01:33:07.12
I don't even know if he's all right, right there for how to negate

1205
01:33:07.28 --> 01:33:12.24
Geminate up anyway if you're on the path with you know whether you with somebody on the path or by yourself

1206
01:33:12.24 --> 01:33:14.24
Where you feel like you by yourself

1207
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:17.44
It's not always gonna be easy and to make you more efficient

1208
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:20.32
we're gonna decrease

1209
01:33:20.32 --> 01:33:21.84
the beatings

1210
01:33:21.84 --> 01:33:25.28
Increase the recovery so we can maximize gains

1211
01:33:25.76 --> 01:33:28.80
Best way I can put it at this point gains with Z

1212
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:35.12
Sure the soul modern English okay, so in muscle building right

1213
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:37.92
You have the catabolic state. Yes, me and I mean

1214
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:45.20
You have the anabolic state right catabolic essentially there's a lot to it, but is the breakdown muscle

1215
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
rest nutrition

1216
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
induces an anabolic state right we want to upside we want to maximize anabolic state on this path

1217
01:33:57.20 --> 01:33:59.04
Catabolic stays part of the process as well

1218
01:33:59.44 --> 01:34:06.88
But that trans transition from catabolic to anabolic we want that to be the luxury we want that to be the efficient part of it

1219
01:34:07.76 --> 01:34:11.84
Am I right catabolic no brab animal catapulka's bad

1220
01:34:11.84 --> 01:34:17.76
You go okay, there was a funny guy in one of my cartoons where when he would get hungry

1221
01:34:17.76 --> 01:34:21.92
You know he'd be walking dude we need to go get some food and go and catapulka right now

1222
01:34:22.32 --> 01:34:26.96
One of those that's why I said let's read the back out all right well either way

1223
01:34:27.52 --> 01:34:29.52
We got some stuff for you all right so jockel feel

1224
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:36.88
Just talk about this one the energy drink new era new era of energy drink we no longer have to pay a price

1225
01:34:36.88 --> 01:34:43.04
For enjoying energy drinks positivity good taste stain positive

1226
01:34:43.92 --> 01:34:48.80
Give you the boost mentally and physically positive positive and makes you more healthy positive

1227
01:34:49.36 --> 01:34:54.40
It's a health drink that's you have something that has no downside no doubt which is kind of crazy

1228
01:34:55.52 --> 01:35:02.78
Normally everything has a trade off here no trade off right just put pure upside pure upside kind of like such salmon sashimi

1229
01:35:03.12 --> 01:35:04.40
Pure upside

1230
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:10.000
Tick good good for you. Oh, you're better off good free bring. Yeah. Yeah, the whole period upside so yes

1231
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:12.96
In the can

1232
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:17.60
Mango okay, this is my opinion okay, I'll admit mango is the best one straight up

1233
01:35:19.60 --> 01:35:21.20
factually

1234
01:35:21.20 --> 01:35:23.68
factually in my opinion yeah, all right either way

1235
01:35:24.40 --> 01:35:27.52
Either way, we're also free joint stuff you you don't want to have to worry about your joints

1236
01:35:27.52 --> 01:35:34.16
Joint where for super-crile oil also vitamin D and cold waters for your immunity

1237
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:39.60
So look when you consider that these things are taking care of on this path you are more efficient

1238
01:35:39.84 --> 01:35:43.84
More healthy more efficient mental physical boost and as you normally point out these are things

1239
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:47.12
You don't want to have to worry about correct. You don't want to be thinking about your joints

1240
01:35:47.52 --> 01:35:52.72
You don't want to be thinking about getting sick. Yep. You just you want that stuff to be handled handle handle it

1241
01:35:52.88 --> 01:35:54.16
Does handle it?

1242
01:35:54.16 --> 01:35:56.16
That's what we're saying. Yep. It's true. Also

1243
01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:03.12
Speaking of anabolic protein. It's probably nutrition profile of gains as it were

1244
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:10.48
So moke a discerr protein informed of a desert another one of these up when win win scenarios

What is upside across the board?

1274
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:11.76
Yeah, we're working on big time upside. That's what we're doing. No downside

1275
01:38:11.76 --> 01:38:16.80
Yeah, speaking of upside so I do have my first pair of Delta 68 jeans

1276
01:38:17.52 --> 01:38:21.68
Finally realized. Yeah, so here's what that did with the you know you know how like you

1277
01:38:22.32 --> 01:38:26.24
What you call when you build something up in your mind finally when it comes you have this you know

1278
01:38:26.64 --> 01:38:31.28
Did it measure up or did it not you have the high expectations yep? So did it measure up here's the thing

1279
01:38:31.92 --> 01:38:38.24
They do measure up in fact they more than measure up because you know how like you'll say okay they kind of have a stretch

1280
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:44.72
Tom cool they have a stretch to them but why not since I don't really have any stretchy jeans

1281
01:38:45.28 --> 01:38:49.76
Or any jeans with a stretch to them I don't really know that even means one I put them on you know

1282
01:38:51.28 --> 01:38:52.32
What it's nice

1283
01:38:52.64 --> 01:39:00.08
It's good. It's like in fact it's hard to go back now. No, there is no going back. It's insane. Yeah, so yeah, dang impressive

1284
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:05.28
I didn't know so much could go into I knew stuff goes into jeans. I understand what's weird

1285
01:39:05.28 --> 01:39:10.000
You it's hard to understand how much better something could be yes it's hard to imagine if you don't know

1286
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:14.80
You just don't know you just hard to imagine how much better they can be than a normal pair of jeans

1287
01:39:14.80 --> 01:39:21.12
Yeah, and again to be made in America with American cotton you know an American buttons

1288
01:39:22.40 --> 01:39:25.60
American hands as a American hands exactly right

1289
01:39:25.92 --> 01:39:29.20
So yeah, or do you know say calm that's the spot right there also

1290
01:39:29.20 --> 01:39:35.52
Jocquoise store it's called jocquoise store so you go to jocquoise store.com and this is where you can get

1291
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:45.68
Trying to think of a more interesting way to properly convey the cool stuff you can get but at the end of the day you can just get your t-shirts

1292
01:39:46.32 --> 01:39:48.32
hats hoodies

1293
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:50.32
represent the path

1294
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:56.40
I think that's the best way to put it just clean equals freedom good take the high ground or the high ground will take you

1295
01:39:56.40 --> 01:39:58.88
Some good

1296
01:39:58.88 --> 01:39:59.84
That's a t-shirt

1297
01:39:59.84 --> 01:40:03.12
Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey subscribe to this podcast

1298
01:40:04.08 --> 01:40:08.80
And we also have some other podcast got jockel unraveling with Darryl Cooper we got the ground new podcast

1299
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:14.16
We got the warrior kid podcast. Theo Vaughan has a podcast check it out. It's called this past weekend

1300
01:40:14.96 --> 01:40:18.16
And he talks about stuff and it's both funny and

1301
01:40:18.96 --> 01:40:20.96
Revealing and

1302
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:27.52
Could help you I like listening to it so check that one out. We're um, and Carrie were talking

1303
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
During the break and where at Theo has this

1304
01:40:31.36 --> 01:40:34.32
It's pretty unique quality about him where

1305
01:40:35.28 --> 01:40:44.08
He's like funny, but he's so authentic and open about that even not so funny parts of you know and I think some people they'll try to do this and they'll try to like

1306
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:51.68
Like quote unquote pull it off, but they lack the full authenticity so they try and pull off the authenticity

1307
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:56.72
Yes, and which is kind of a what he call a catch 22 like if you're trying to pull off authenticity

1308
01:40:56.72 --> 01:41:00.08
That's not enough itself makes it not a thing. Yeah exactly right, but

1309
01:41:00.56 --> 01:41:06.72
Theo is like a naturally what seems natural like he's a naturally authentic person it sounds like from what you're saying though

1310
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:10.56
He wasn't always like that and he had to sort of open up about it over time

1311
01:41:10.56 --> 01:41:15.76
Okay, so and this is what we're talking about where a lot of times where if you have the

1312
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:18.80
Being funny to people

1313
01:41:19.20 --> 01:41:22.88
Legitimately is it's kind of like a superpower like

1314
01:41:23.76 --> 01:41:30.08
You can essentially best still one of the best feelings on to a person and make them laugh right that's one of the best feelings

1315
01:41:30.08 --> 01:41:34.96
You can ever have is like laughing legitimately and you have that as a superpower

1316
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:37.60
You're just a funny person right so a lot of people

1317
01:41:37.60 --> 01:41:42.96
Whether they have like internal issues or not that starts to become the the front running

1318
01:41:43.60 --> 01:41:48.32
Quality where they're always pushing that forward. You know, they're always leading with that leading with that

1319
01:41:48.56 --> 01:41:50.32
And it's always successful

1320
01:41:50.32 --> 01:41:53.76
Meanwhile the other stuff on the inside gets protected

1321
01:41:54.08 --> 01:41:58.40
You know, so anytime someone feels awkward or anytime someone feels vulnerable

1322
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:04.08
Even scared or whatever anything that they don't like they can just boom they can bust out the comedy and

1323
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:08.88
And they'll be protected in fact they'll get a payoff from it. They won't just be protected. You know

1324
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:14.24
But after a while the stuff on the inside becomes more and more sensitive, you know

1325
01:42:14.56 --> 01:42:20.28
Where if it even if it's exposed this much it's like well the reaction is a little bit a lot stronger, you know

1326
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:25.52
But Theo does a good job in like opening up and exposing that a little bit

1327
01:42:25.76 --> 01:42:31.20
And at the end of the day as an audience while I'm speaking for myself. It's kind of like you just like him more

1328
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:37.76
Yeah, no, he's a very like bogey and he part of the reason that he's like bulls because he is like that like what you're saying and he I even

1329
01:42:38.16 --> 01:42:40.64
But last night I went and saw him do his

1330
01:42:41.20 --> 01:42:44.24
Do a comedy stand-up routine. Is that what it's called?

1331
01:42:46.08 --> 01:42:50.72
Why so I'm doing it and what's cool is like you could see he's not

1332
01:42:52.32 --> 01:42:54.32
Like he's

1333
01:42:54.88 --> 01:42:56.08
He's

1334
01:42:56.08 --> 01:43:02.48
Real up there like he's saying something. He'd like I don't know I'm saying you know that means I don't know what I'm saying. He did that a couple times today

1335
01:43:02.48 --> 01:43:05.28
I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. He did that a couple times really

1336
01:43:05.28 --> 01:43:06.88
There go okay well

1337
01:43:06.88 --> 01:43:12.16
At least we know that we're getting the real real person. Yeah, it's not just a big memorized script that you know

1338
01:43:13.12 --> 01:43:15.36
Where it's all a big front

1339
01:43:15.36 --> 01:43:22.24
Yeah, right we don't want the front. Yeah, like a lot of times if you're just talking with your friend and you go off on some tangent or something

1340
01:43:22.24 --> 01:43:28.32
That's the kind of stuff you're gonna say to your friend you know or your friends behind closed doors, you know just like in your own little environment

1341
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:33.48
But yeah, I should sometimes I don't know what I'm talking about you know, but he's like so open with that and I don't mean

1342
01:43:33.48 --> 01:43:37.68
Open like he's like making this huge effort to be open

1343
01:43:37.68 --> 01:43:39.92
You just naturally it's like yeah

1344
01:43:40.72 --> 01:43:43.68
Good guy man. I've spent some time with him and

1345
01:43:44.08 --> 01:43:50.12
Definitely a really good authentic nice funny guy man. I really like him a lot

1346
01:43:50.12 --> 01:43:52.12
I'm glad he was able to come on

1347
01:43:52.52 --> 01:43:57.000
You know another podcast that there is out there. It's called jacca owner ground calm

1348
01:43:57.48 --> 01:43:59.48
This is the one where in the event of

1349
01:44:01.72 --> 01:44:04.84
contingencies happening where the world goes crazy

1350
01:44:05.88 --> 01:44:09.000
Because that's basically the world's getting a little crazy right now

1351
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.12
Let's say it gets crazy or and they either start

1352
01:44:12.92 --> 01:44:18.04
I don't know maybe they start injecting advertisements into the middle of this podcast or they start maybe they start

1353
01:44:18.04 --> 01:44:22.12
Banting parts of this podcast. I don't know what they're gonna do

1354
01:44:22.12 --> 01:44:25.88
I do know this right now everyone's being pretty cool to us

1355
01:44:26.36 --> 01:44:31.000
But there might come a time where they where they say hey, we don't want you to do that or we you're gonna follow our rules

1356
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So we have a contingency

1357
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.32

1360
01:44:52.04 --> 01:44:54.04

You can press play on your MP3 player of choice and you can listen to

1383

By the way, you can go and buy a fake one

1388
01:46:32.52 --> 01:46:35.72
From you know one of these various places

1389
01:46:35.72 --> 01:46:40.76
Very fake players that are just jacking yeah, they have the whole good thing written out

1390
01:46:40.76 --> 01:46:44.52
They sell it on a t-shirt. They sell it on a print and I'm not talking about that

1391
01:46:44.52 --> 01:46:45.56
I'm talking about them

1392
01:46:45.56 --> 01:46:50.52
Clearly because there's a lot of people yeah, it is weird super wack a lot of times those though

1393
01:46:50.52 --> 01:46:54.12
You can all you got to do a think for one second. Just think for one second

1394
01:46:54.12 --> 01:46:59.48
Like with what they really sell this, you know and then call it this it makes very little sense

1395
01:46:59.48 --> 01:47:03.48
Oh, so you're saying it's easy to see through the the fake all you got to do is pause for one second

1396
01:47:03.48 --> 01:47:06.92
