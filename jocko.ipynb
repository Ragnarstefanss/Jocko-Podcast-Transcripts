    "\n",
    "60\n",
    "00:03:12.60 --> 00:03:15.04\n",

    "61\n",
    "00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:17.12\n",

    "\n",
    "63\n",
    "00:03:20.04 --> 00:03:22.24\n",

    "\n",
    "64\n",
    "00:03:22.24 --> 00:03:24.12\n",
    "because we were talking, and we have conversations\n",

    "65\n",
    "00:03:24.12 --> 00:03:27.48\n",

    "67\n",
    "00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:32.28\n",
    "And that kind of rolled into, when we started talking\n",
    "\n",
    "68\n",
    "00:03:32.28 --> 00:03:34.24\n",
    "about doing a podcast, and I said,\n",

    "\n",
    "73\n",
    "00:03:44.92 --> 00:03:46.40\n",

    "78\n",
    "00:03:54.24 --> 00:03:59.88\n",

    "\n",
    "161\n",
    "00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.76\n",
    "Because I wake up late.\n",

    "\n",
    "163\n",
    "00:07:31.04 --> 00:07:32.72\n",
    "So my schedule was just shifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "164\n",
    "00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:37.84\n",
    "I still, you know, work out and, and work hard for the most part\n",
    "\n",
    "165\n",
    "00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:40.20\n",
    "during the day, but my schedule was just shifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "166\n",
    "00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:43.32\n",
    "But I think a lot of times I'm viewed as like, oh, this is like late\n",
    "\n",
    "167\n",
    "00:07:43.32 --> 00:07:48.32\n",
    "riser, like early risers just to begin with kind of seem like these.\n",

    "\n",
    "176\n",
    "00:08:11.12 --> 00:08:18.000\n",

    "\n",
    "177\n",
    "00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000\n",
    "Where?\n",
    "\n",
    "178\n",
    "00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000\n",
    "What's the difference, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "179\n",
    "00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.96\n",
    "Well, they're technically, there is no difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "180\n",
    "00:08:22.96 --> 00:08:26.92\n",
    "And actually, I've talked to people that they're on the night shift, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "181\n",
    "00:08:26.92 --> 00:08:31.16\n",
    "You know, so they get home at 4 o'clock in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "182\n",
    "00:08:31.16 --> 00:08:36.36\n",
    "And, but I think we both know.\n",
    "\n",
    "183\n",
    "00:08:36.36 --> 00:08:40.48\n",
    "I think we both know what the difference is.\n",
    "\n",
    "184\n",
    "00:08:40.48 --> 00:08:45.40\n",
    "And, and I truly think, you know, that waking up early.\n",
    "\n",
    "185\n",
    "00:08:45.40 --> 00:08:50.88\n",
    "Now, if that early means noon because you, you work until 7 o'clock in the morning or\n",

    "186\n",
    "00:08:50.88 --> 00:08:56.32\n",

    "\n",
    "187\n",
    "00:08:56.32 --> 00:08:58.80\n",
    "there's, then that's fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "188\n",
    "00:08:58.80 --> 00:09:04.56\n",
    "But if you wake up whenever you want and you slept for 10 hours and you're lazy\n",
    "\n",
    "189\n",
    "00:09:04.56 --> 00:09:07.56\n",

    "\n",
    "190\n",
    "00:09:07.56 --> 00:09:08.56\n",
    "I really do.\n",
    "\n",
    "191\n",
    "00:09:08.56 --> 00:09:11.44\n",
    "I think it's not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "192\n",
    "00:09:11.44 --> 00:09:15.08\n",
    "And again, I know that some people are on those schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "193\n",
    "00:09:15.08 --> 00:09:17.08\n",
    "And I know that some people need more sleep.\n",

    "194\n",
    "00:09:17.08 --> 00:09:19.44\n",
    "That's, that's, I understand that.\n",
    "\n",
    "195\n",
    "00:09:19.44 --> 00:09:21.08\n",
    "There's some genetics involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "196\n",

    "I have one of my daughters genetically.\n",

    "I will go to bed at 11 o'clock at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "198\n",
    "00:09:29.32 --> 00:09:30.72\n",
    "She's still awake.\n",

    "\n",
    "201\n",
    "00:09:33.60 --> 00:09:37.08\n",

    "Yeah.\n",
    "\n",
    "203\n",
    "00:09:39.08 --> 00:09:45.04\n",
    "What, as far as getting up early, let's say, well, how you said, okay,\n",
    "\n",
    "204\n",
    "00:09:45.04 --> 00:09:46.84\n",

    "205\n",

    "\n",
    "206\n",
    "00:09:51.32 --> 00:09:56.20\n",
    "Because let's think of like what they know, what they call the natural sleep cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "207\n",
    "00:09:56.20 --> 00:09:57.88\n",

    "You sleep your however 7.\n",

    "\n",
    "210\n",
    "00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:05.88\n",

    "220\n",
