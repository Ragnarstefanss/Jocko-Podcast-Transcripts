[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 69.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:08] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:10] Good evening.
[00:00:14] The president of the United States takes pride
[00:00:17] in presenting the Medal of Honor,
[00:00:19] posthumously, to Captain Henry T. L. Rodd,
[00:00:24] United States Marine Corps.
[00:00:27] For service as set forth in the following citation.
[00:00:32] For conspicuous gallantry and intrapetity
[00:00:37] at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty
[00:00:41] while attached to Marine of fighting squadron 211
[00:00:45] during action against the Japanese land, surface,
[00:00:49] and early units at Wake Island.
[00:00:52] From 8 to 23 December 1941.
[00:00:58] Engaging vastly superior forces of enemy bombers
[00:01:02] and warships on 9 and 12 December,
[00:01:05] Captain L. Rodd shot down two of a flight of 22 hostile planes
[00:01:11] and executing repeated bombing and strafing runs
[00:01:15] at extremely low altitude and close range,
[00:01:18] succeeded in flicking deadly damage
[00:01:20] upon a large Japanese vessel
[00:01:23] thereby sinking the first major warship
[00:01:25] to be destroyed by small caliber bombs delivered
[00:01:28] from a fighter type aircraft.
[00:01:32] When his plane was disabled by hostile fire
[00:01:35] and no other ships were operative,
[00:01:37] Captain L. Rodd assumed command of one flank of the line,
[00:01:41] set up in defiance of the enemy landing
[00:01:44] and conducting a brilliant defense,
[00:01:47] enabled his men to hold their positions
[00:01:49] and repulse determined enemy attacks repeatedly,
[00:01:53] proceeding through intense hostile fuselage
[00:01:57] to provide covering fire for unarmed ammunition carriers.
[00:02:04] Capturing an automatic weapon during one enemy rushing force,
[00:02:09] he gave his own firearm to one of his men
[00:02:11] and fought on vigorously against the Japanese.
[00:02:14] Responsible in a large measure of the strength of his sectors,
[00:02:20] gallons resistance.
[00:02:22] On 23 December, Captain L. Rodd led his men
[00:02:26] with bold, aggressiveness until he fell, mortally wounded.
[00:02:33] His superb skill as a pilot, daring leadership,
[00:02:37] an unswerving devotion to duty
[00:02:40] to distinguish him among the defenders of Wakeland.
[00:02:45] And his valiant conduct reflects the highest credit
[00:02:48] upon himself and the United States Naval Service.
[00:02:54] He gallantly gave his life for his country.
[00:03:01] signed Harry S. Truman.
[00:03:03] And that is the Medal of Honor citation
[00:03:11] for Henry Talmage, L. Rodd, the first aviator
[00:03:15] in World War II to be awarded the Medal of Honor.
[00:03:19] In the first man to sink a warship from a fighter plane
[00:03:24] during the Battle of Wakeland.
[00:03:25] And if you don't know anything about the Battle of Wakeland,
[00:03:28] it began simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor
[00:03:33] when that started.
[00:03:34] And it ended on 23 December 1941
[00:03:39] when American forces were forced to surrender.
[00:03:45] And that was, with around 500 American servicemen,
[00:03:50] and they had a handful of coastal artillery pieces
[00:03:54] and a handful of anti-aircraft guns,
[00:03:57] and they had 12 aircraft.
[00:04:00] And what they were facing was 2,500 Japanese infantry
[00:04:05] supported by three light cruisers, eight destroyers,
[00:04:09] two patrol boats, two troop transports,
[00:04:12] two aircraft carriers with all their planes
[00:04:14] and two heavy cruisers.
[00:04:18] They were completely outnumbered
[00:04:20] and completely and utterly outgunned.
[00:04:23] But they held out for 15 days
[00:04:27] and while they were under that siege,
[00:04:30] on the 20th of December,
[00:04:33] while the Japanese were preparing for their final attack,
[00:04:37] major L-Rodd got out one last letter to his wife.
[00:04:44] And I'm gonna read that to you.
[00:04:53] Saturday, 20 December 1941,
[00:04:56] my dearest darling sweetheart.
[00:05:01] I never suspected this afternoon
[00:05:03] when I wrote my other short note
[00:05:06] that I would be sitting down writing another tonight.
[00:05:09] But here we are.
[00:05:11] I just got in a few minutes ago
[00:05:13] and have just learned that Walt Baylor is returning
[00:05:16] and he has kindly consented to deliver to this personally.
[00:05:20] So I am very thankful for the moment.
[00:05:24] Of course, there isn't a lot of news
[00:05:26] that I can write about it.
[00:05:28] And you probably know more real news than I do anyhow.
[00:05:34] I am missing you terribly
[00:05:35] and I am undergoing a few new experiences
[00:05:39] but also is everyone else.
[00:05:44] We've had considerable rain today
[00:05:46] and you're still cloudy.
[00:05:48] The wind has been very low, however.
[00:05:52] The weather on the whole is nothing to complain about.
[00:05:57] But I would like to see a good old fashioned,
[00:05:59] ties, food, sweep this entire area.
[00:06:04] I imagine there is an awful lot of white washing
[00:06:06] going on now in high places.
[00:06:08] It certainly will be a criminal shame
[00:06:10] if they succeed in covering over everything.
[00:06:17] I am writing this in something of a hurry
[00:06:19] and under somewhat difficult circumstances.
[00:06:24] I'll think of a million things
[00:06:26] that I should have said after I had gone to bed tonight.
[00:06:31] But now I'm going to say that I love you
[00:06:34] and you alone always and always
[00:06:37] and repeated a million times or so.
[00:06:42] Give my love to Mary also
[00:06:45] between the two of you, you have it all.
[00:06:51] There isn't any for anyone else.
[00:06:56] I know that you are praying for me
[00:06:58] and I have nothing more to ask
[00:07:01] than that your prayers be answered.
[00:07:02] You're as devotedly and loving,
[00:07:10] tell much.
[00:07:24] And so I think it's important that
[00:07:29] when you hear that letter,
[00:07:31] you recognize the fact that this is a man.
[00:07:38] And of course, we always remember
[00:07:40] that these men, we call them heroes,
[00:07:49] deserve it be so.
[00:07:51] We do that to honor them.
[00:07:53] But I think it's important to always remember
[00:07:57] that these heroes,
[00:08:02] their people, their people.
[00:08:12] And these men, these heroes, these Marines, these people
[00:08:18] that held the line.
[00:08:21] They held the line for 15 days
[00:08:23] before they were forced to surrender
[00:08:25] after losing 49 Marines killed,
[00:08:28] two missing in action, three Navy personnel killed,
[00:08:32] 70 US civilians killed.
[00:08:34] And by the way, the Japanese losses were recorded
[00:08:37] about 820 killed with over 300 wounded.
[00:08:42] Two destroyers lost
[00:08:44] and almost 30 Japanese aircraft shot down her damaged.
[00:08:55] But the odds and the ratio of force
[00:09:03] was just stacked against the US forces on Wake Island
[00:09:08] and when you get into a situation like that,
[00:09:10] a dire situation, violent situation,
[00:09:14] a situation where you are facing a determined enemy.
[00:09:21] There is a bond that forms between people.
[00:09:28] Regardless of where they're from
[00:09:30] or what their background is
[00:09:32] or what their socioeconomic class is
[00:09:36] or what service they were in,
[00:09:38] none of that matters.
[00:09:39] There's a bond that forms that cannot be broken.
[00:09:52] And we certainly had that in the Battle of Ramadi.
[00:09:57] The US Army soldiers, United States Marines,
[00:10:03] C.B.S.R. Seals of Task Unit,
[00:10:09] Bruser, all of us that were in that fight,
[00:10:15] had that bond.
[00:10:22] We were brothers.
[00:10:27] And tonight, I am honored to have one of those brothers
[00:10:35] here with me.
[00:10:36] And he's a Marine Corps Aviator, fighter pilot
[00:10:44] who also did time as a forward air controller on the ground.
[00:10:49] And we've talked about that in many of the books
[00:10:52] that we've reviewed on the podcast
[00:10:53] where you have a Marine Corps pilot
[00:10:56] who's now on the ground with the troops.
[00:11:00] Usually in one of the most forward positions
[00:11:02] because they have to know where the troops are, out of that
[00:11:08] air conditioned cockpit and into the sweat and mud
[00:11:14] on the ground and this pilot as an Anglico team leader
[00:11:20] who with his team conducted dozens and dozens
[00:11:23] of missions with Tasmania Bruser in Ramadi
[00:11:26] and I've talked about bringing them on the show.
[00:11:28] And so here he is tonight, Lieutenant Colonel,
[00:11:34] almost retired, David Burke.
[00:11:39] Dave, welcome to the podcast and thank you for coming on.
[00:11:46] Thanks for having me, man.
[00:11:47] It's good to be here.
[00:11:50] So we have to, before we talk about what we went through
[00:11:55] together, we have to learn a little bit about you
[00:11:58] where you came from, what you did
[00:12:00] and how you went from being,
[00:12:04] from being a pilot, but not just a pilot,
[00:12:08] a top gun pilot, but not just a top gun pilot,
[00:12:10] but a top gun instructor
[00:12:14] which is just incredibly selective.
[00:12:18] That's gonna be one of the most selective things
[00:12:20] in the whole world.
[00:12:22] Right?
[00:12:23] How many top gun pilots are there?
[00:12:25] So you've got 25 at a time every three years that kind of rotate
[00:12:27] through a small group.
[00:12:29] Yeah, so that's ridiculous.
[00:12:32] And, but then you thought maybe I you need to get after
[00:12:36] a little bit more, so you're gonna go do an A,
[00:12:37] because so we'll get into that, but let's start off with
[00:12:40] where you came from, just a little bit about your background
[00:12:44] and how you ended up saying, you know what I think I wanna do?
[00:12:47] Being the Marine Corps, go.
[00:12:49] Right on.
[00:12:51] So I actually grew up around here.
[00:12:52] My parents moved out here,
[00:12:53] San Diego and I was probably a year and a half years old.
[00:12:55] I wanted half years old.
[00:12:57] In between, here in Orange County, I grew up
[00:12:59] in Silicon Valley, California, kid.
[00:13:02] Not all that exciting with childhood.
[00:13:04] I don't have, you know, a ton of crazy memories.
[00:13:06] I was pretty quiet kid as a good kid in school.
[00:13:08] Got a long with most folks.
[00:13:11] Moved up Orange County, my parents got divorced.
[00:13:13] It was basically just me and my mom and my sister for a while.
[00:13:16] And I lived in a town called El Toro
[00:13:19] and what happened to be very close to where I grew up
[00:13:21] was a Marine Base, it was a fighter base.
[00:13:24] And so as a kid, I posed there in late 70s
[00:13:27] and early 80s they had F4 fanomes and A4s and A6s
[00:13:32] and just the cool jets at the time.
[00:13:34] And so I went to the air show every year,
[00:13:37] grew up out there and I think it was no joke.
[00:13:39] It was overhead, I could see it every day.
[00:13:41] And I think that just got my blood a little bit.
[00:13:45] Went to El Toro high school, went to the air show,
[00:13:47] probably every year from my six years old till the time
[00:13:50] the base closed down, no joke.
[00:13:51] I mean it was just part of my life.
[00:13:53] And I met some people along the way too.
[00:13:55] There was a lot of Marines living there.
[00:13:56] So I had some real powerful influences
[00:13:58] that kind of got him towards that.
[00:14:01] I'm sure we're gonna get into this
[00:14:02] because it's come up already in the pre-conversation.
[00:14:04] Put it around 14, let's say.
[00:14:06] Watch this obscure movie called Top Gun.
[00:14:09] Straight up, top Gun.
[00:14:11] Straight up man.
[00:14:12] Watch the movie is a kid.
[00:14:14] Saw dudes flying airplanes, off carriers,
[00:14:18] shooting down mags and I'm like,
[00:14:19] I wanna do that.
[00:14:21] And probably by 14, I had a pretty good idea
[00:14:25] that's what I wanted to do.
[00:14:27] Did you make the connection between school and grades
[00:14:30] and all that stuff?
[00:14:31] Because a lot of people saw that movie and said,
[00:14:33] I wanna be a top Gun pilot,
[00:14:34] but I'm still gonna slack off and do whatever I want
[00:14:36] and not play hooky and all that.
[00:14:38] Somehow you made that connection.
[00:14:40] It's not shown in the movie, right?
[00:14:41] They didn't show people studying hard in school
[00:14:44] because that would have not sold a lot of tickets.
[00:14:46] Oh no.
[00:14:47] I did eventually.
[00:14:49] I mean, when I watched that movie,
[00:14:51] I think there was just something,
[00:14:52] I'd always been interested in aviation.
[00:14:53] It's kind of captivating when you see planes flying around
[00:14:55] and to get to see the air shows, see the blue angels,
[00:14:57] I kind of said,
[00:14:57] if you can't help it look up and watch that stuff,
[00:14:59] it's cool.
[00:15:01] I would say that my performance in the academic arena
[00:15:05] was slightly less than stellar.
[00:15:07] I did find, but I had no real motivation to do anything.
[00:15:11] I wasn't a little driven kid to work really hard.
[00:15:15] I kind of discovered that if I put in very,
[00:15:17] little effort, I was okay.
[00:15:18] And if I wanted to do really well,
[00:15:19] I had to put in a lot of effort
[00:15:20] and I had made a much of a connection.
[00:15:22] But as I got a little older,
[00:15:25] you know, watch the movie,
[00:15:25] I think that was a part of a lot of different things.
[00:15:27] But about the time I was 16,
[00:15:29] it kind of junior year in high school.
[00:15:32] As I got some other influences in my life,
[00:15:34] I found big as one was a guy named Aaron Irvin.
[00:15:35] I started working at Target around the corner
[00:15:37] from my house and he was a Marine there.
[00:15:38] And like I said, my parents got divorced.
[00:15:41] I had a step dad that was there
[00:15:43] and kind of coming going,
[00:15:44] he ended up being a really big father figure in my life.
[00:15:46] And a real positive influence and a Marine,
[00:15:48] which was great.
[00:15:49] And he explains some more things about what it's like
[00:15:52] to be in Marine.
[00:15:52] He's the one that made the connection for me
[00:15:54] that all that stuff you saw in the movie
[00:15:56] is you can actually do that for real.
[00:15:57] The Marine Corps, you can do that as a Marine.
[00:15:59] You know, it's not just a movie.
[00:16:00] That's a real life.
[00:16:01] Somebody's living that life right now.
[00:16:03] And you can do that.
[00:16:04] And I remember coming home and kind of telling my mom,
[00:16:06] like, hey, I'm 16, I'm a junior high school.
[00:16:09] I'm thinking about being a Marine Corps fighter pilot,
[00:16:11] which I had no military in my back
[00:16:13] or nobody had ever done anything like that.
[00:16:16] And her answer was,
[00:16:17] that sounds awesome.
[00:16:18] You should do that.
[00:16:19] I mean, just 100% and she had a very similar approach.
[00:16:23] You know, everything, I have a,
[00:16:24] every idea I ever had in my life that I run by my mom,
[00:16:27] she's like, well, somebody's gonna do it.
[00:16:29] Mine's all be you.
[00:16:29] That was kind of a approach to everything.
[00:16:31] I want to be a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.
[00:16:32] So I'm just gonna be it.
[00:16:33] Mine's all be you.
[00:16:34] And that's about the time I kind of started
[00:16:36] getting my stuff together.
[00:16:37] I mean, I wasn't a mess by any stretch,
[00:16:39] but I was a little bit just kind of,
[00:16:41] run through my thing, being a kid.
[00:16:43] And I certainly think I was lucky
[00:16:46] because I knew with great detail
[00:16:51] at about 16 and change what I wanted to do.
[00:16:54] I mean, I knew I wanted to be a Marine Corps
[00:16:56] at 18 pilot based in Southern California
[00:16:58] and for life carriers.
[00:17:00] And that's exactly what ended up doing.
[00:17:01] So at that time, everything I started to do
[00:17:04] from there was with that kind of singular focus
[00:17:07] of circling back to do that.
[00:17:09] I even knew I wanted to be stationed at Altorra.
[00:17:11] I mean, I had a real specific plan.
[00:17:13] And so all the things I started doing from there,
[00:17:15] school, you know, into college as well,
[00:17:18] go into the Marine Corps,
[00:17:19] and recruit her to say I wanted to join the Marine Corps,
[00:17:21] be an officer in the Marine Corps.
[00:17:22] All those things were geared very specifically
[00:17:24] towards that goal.
[00:17:25] Now there's a ton of hurdles
[00:17:26] between time you're 16 and time.
[00:17:27] I got my commission at 21.
[00:17:29] But everything else that I did in my life
[00:17:32] was either a distraction that just got rid of,
[00:17:34] or it was a means to that end.
[00:17:37] I worked full time,
[00:17:39] I was in school, put myself through the nearest college,
[00:17:42] the local state school that I lived,
[00:17:45] close to as a drove up to school,
[00:17:47] didn't have like a real big exciting college life.
[00:17:49] Wasn't in the fraternity, didn't go away to school.
[00:17:52] I paid my way through a school.
[00:17:54] I got a good education.
[00:17:54] I worked really hard to do well,
[00:17:56] but it was all specifically designed to,
[00:17:59] you want to be in the Marine Corps and be an officer,
[00:18:00] you need to college graduate, you need to be a college graduate.
[00:18:03] Right on, I can do that.
[00:18:04] I can do that here.
[00:18:05] Where's the closest college?
[00:18:05] Yeah, where's the closest college?
[00:18:06] How much does it cost?
[00:18:07] How much do I need to work?
[00:18:08] Did the math.
[00:18:09] It was my life from about that time.
[00:18:11] I started working, like I said, I worked at Target as a kid.
[00:18:14] I worked at Target from the time I was 15 and a half
[00:18:17] and got to work permit from school to the time
[00:18:20] that I got my commission in the Marine Corps.
[00:18:22] And I went to school and Casay Fullerton,
[00:18:24] Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
[00:18:25] My mom was a guidance counselor in a teacher,
[00:18:27] so she helped me build a schedule
[00:18:28] that I could graduate this fast as possible,
[00:18:30] which is exactly in four years.
[00:18:32] It was all day Monday, all day Wednesday,
[00:18:33] and half a day Friday.
[00:18:35] And I worked Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:18:38] The money I paid, I got paid, I went to my tuition,
[00:18:41] my tuition went to my education, my education,
[00:18:43] got me a commission in the Marine Corps.
[00:18:45] I mean, that was kind of it.
[00:18:46] I mean, in some ways you look back,
[00:18:47] I'm probably could have diversified a little bit.
[00:18:49] But at the time, I wasn't unhappy.
[00:18:51] I was stoked, man.
[00:18:52] I was exactly what I wanted to be doing.
[00:18:54] There was no man I wish I could be doing this.
[00:18:56] It wasn't a chore by any stretch.
[00:18:58] Like I said, in retrospect, I probably could have done things
[00:19:00] a little bit differently, but 17-year-old day-birth,
[00:19:03] 18-year-old day-birth, new exactly what
[00:19:05] he wanted to do.
[00:19:06] And I had sort of talked myself into it.
[00:19:07] Like, hey, any detour, that's going to throw you off your path, man.
[00:19:10] And you're going to look back with it regretting go,
[00:19:12] you know why you didn't have been what you wanted to be?
[00:19:14] You just took us at this or that.
[00:19:15] And I wasn't going to let that happen.
[00:19:16] So I kind of just got a little intense about being
[00:19:20] a pound in the Marine Corps and sharing it up.
[00:19:21] And there's still luck involved, because when you go to TBS,
[00:19:24] which is the basic school, which all marine officers go through,
[00:19:27] you have to still win or get that billet that you wanted.
[00:19:33] And you got that.
[00:19:35] But I mean, that could have gone totally mad.
[00:19:38] Sideways.
[00:19:38] There's a lot of luck involved.
[00:19:41] I think everybody in the military, and everybody that's
[00:19:43] been successful in the military knows you're looking back
[00:19:45] in your career, it's a confluence of a lot of different things.
[00:19:48] But timing, circumstance, and luck, or they're a part of it
[00:19:51] without a doubt.
[00:19:51] Nobody can take credit for everything they've done.
[00:19:53] And if I went back to do it again, the odds of it
[00:19:56] work out the way they did are pretty slim.
[00:19:57] There's just a lot of things that worked out on my favor.
[00:20:01] But I went to OCS.
[00:20:02] I went to the Marine Corps recruit,
[00:20:04] started my freshman year at Cal State Fullerton,
[00:20:06] as a 17-1er sort of college, went right to their crew
[00:20:09] around day one, or they called an OCS officer selection officer.
[00:20:12] So it's basically a recruiter for officers.
[00:20:13] I want to be in Marine.
[00:20:14] It's like right on, start filling up the spade work.
[00:20:16] But at the payboard, I said, I want to be a pilot,
[00:20:18] as a piece of cake, no problem.
[00:20:20] We can make that happen.
[00:20:22] Sign this ground contract, and we'll just make it
[00:20:24] part of the standpoint of the future.
[00:20:25] So for those of you that don't know, that's a big lie.
[00:20:29] It ain't that easy.
[00:20:30] So when he says ground contract, of course,
[00:20:32] the Marine Corps needs pilots and guys to infantry.
[00:20:36] And so, but they need more infantry than they need pilots.
[00:20:39] And so they say, hey, don't worry about it.
[00:20:40] You just sign up for ground right now.
[00:20:41] We'll take care of that other pilot.
[00:20:43] You want to be a pie?
[00:20:43] Yeah, of course, we'll take care of that later.
[00:20:45] Yeah, we'll just transition over.
[00:20:46] It should have made a big deal.
[00:20:46] No factor.
[00:20:47] And at 17, I mean, I was signing paperwork
[00:20:50] to be a Marine officer.
[00:20:51] That was a big step for me.
[00:20:53] And I probably would have signed anything.
[00:20:55] Happily signed that after my freshman year in college,
[00:20:58] I went to OCS or Canada School.
[00:21:01] And to be honest with you, and I had all these big-grand ideas
[00:21:04] for the last two, three years, I knew what I wanted to do.
[00:21:06] But when I went to OCS, I was a first real hurdle.
[00:21:10] I mean, everything else was either an idea, a plan, some paperwork.
[00:21:14] I get to the off-circuit of the school.
[00:21:15] And it's like, OK, it was a real Marine drill,
[00:21:17] and Chuck or Scrimm and Atcha, you're really doing the deed there.
[00:21:20] And getting through OCS was a big thing for me,
[00:21:23] because it was a first real test of,
[00:21:25] and I knew what I wanted to do.
[00:21:26] But I had no real sense of I had what was required
[00:21:29] to be a Marine.
[00:21:30] And I think as a kid, you build up what that is in your mind.
[00:21:34] It's a larger than life thing.
[00:21:36] How could anybody possibly do this?
[00:21:38] You turned it into something more than it is.
[00:21:39] When I went to boot camp, there was a Navy seal there.
[00:21:43] And I swear, when I saw him, I was like, God, look,
[00:21:47] I need huge, huge, big giant farms.
[00:21:52] And big, just a big massive guy.
[00:21:55] It just looked like a destroyer of human life.
[00:21:58] Oh my God.
[00:21:59] So fast forward four years on the teams.
[00:22:04] And I meet this guy.
[00:22:05] And he's not at all man.
[00:22:07] He was completely in my head.
[00:22:09] It was completely in my head.
[00:22:10] But this guy was such a destroyer.
[00:22:11] But I just thought, hey, he's a seal.
[00:22:14] He must be a destroyer.
[00:22:16] And I actually saw it that way.
[00:22:18] Yeah.
[00:22:19] You can't help it.
[00:22:19] And it certainly at that age.
[00:22:20] I mean, those things are real powerful influences.
[00:22:23] When you get out to OCS and all of a sudden,
[00:22:25] you're like, oh, man, I need to, I didn't make this happen.
[00:22:28] That was a big achievement in my life.
[00:22:30] I said, hey, I can do this.
[00:22:31] OK, I started to realize I'm not the biggest guy in the Marine Corps.
[00:22:35] Nobody's going to mistake me for a destroyer.
[00:22:37] But what I discovered as I got there,
[00:22:39] I knew mentally what I wanted to do.
[00:22:42] It wasn't a real question mark about my intentions,
[00:22:44] or my desires.
[00:22:45] And I was surrounded by tough, strong kids.
[00:22:47] Young kids, my age that are trying to bring marine officers.
[00:22:49] And that's a physical and a mental challenge.
[00:22:52] So there's no doubt about it.
[00:22:53] And I was seeing guys kind of left and right of me
[00:22:56] that looked at least bigger, faster, stronger, tougher.
[00:23:01] And more capable than they looked like that.
[00:23:03] That same image I had in your mind.
[00:23:04] And I'm watching these things kind of fall out of stuff.
[00:23:06] We're not finished stuff fast enough.
[00:23:07] We're just straight up quit.
[00:23:10] Guys would deal or drop on requests at OCS.
[00:23:13] And I was kind of looking around thinking, what's going on?
[00:23:18] Why are you here if your plan wasn't to get through it?
[00:23:21] So that was a really good thing for me, psychologically,
[00:23:26] to realize that it wasn't just a fantasy or a dream.
[00:23:28] I had the potential to be able to do this.
[00:23:31] So I got through a C.S.
[00:23:33] That's kind of a painful process.
[00:23:35] As you know, it's 84 days.
[00:23:36] It can be slogging.
[00:23:37] You lose a lot of folks doing it for all those
[00:23:39] who are just different reasons.
[00:23:40] Some people get hurt.
[00:23:41] Some people quit.
[00:23:41] Some people just can't do it.
[00:23:44] And when you get on the backside of that,
[00:23:45] like I can make this happen, let's get that air contract.
[00:23:49] Well, we'll get to that air contract.
[00:23:50] At the basics school.
[00:23:51] So when you get your commission, you finish school,
[00:23:54] you get your degree, finish officer,
[00:23:56] candid school, and so basically it's a head you've done everything
[00:23:58] that you need.
[00:23:59] Your commission officer became a second-of-the-end
[00:24:01] in the Marine Corps in June of 1994.
[00:24:03] And the first thing you do is on active duty as a Marine
[00:24:05] is you go to something called the basis school.
[00:24:06] And you've talked about it a few times.
[00:24:08] It's basically a school for the Marine Corps
[00:24:10] teaches officers a little bit of everything.
[00:24:12] Doesn't teach you everything of anything,
[00:24:14] but you get a little exposure to infantry,
[00:24:16] you expose your tanks, artillery, call for fire,
[00:24:19] you get a little exposure aviation, patrol, and defense off.
[00:24:22] And so you kind of get a whole way in the land
[00:24:24] and the whole point of that for the Marine Corps,
[00:24:26] you go there with 250 people.
[00:24:28] And they got to give you one of those people in assignment.
[00:24:30] A particular job and MLS, a specialty.
[00:24:34] And they rank you.
[00:24:35] I mean, you are ranked from one to 250.
[00:24:39] And for aviation when I got there,
[00:24:41] I remember getting in the first week.
[00:24:42] They kind of announced what billets
[00:24:44] are going to be available.
[00:24:45] I were going to have 40 infantry slots and 20.
[00:24:48] They just tell you kind of what we expect to have
[00:24:50] breakdown.
[00:24:51] And from there, you're supposed to go back and think
[00:24:52] about what you want to do.
[00:24:54] They had two pilot slots.
[00:24:57] And like, man, that is some rough math,
[00:24:59] 250 folks.
[00:25:00] Now, not all 250 wanted to be a pilot.
[00:25:02] Obviously, not all 250 people were qualified with their eyes
[00:25:06] and whatnot.
[00:25:07] So it wasn't competing with 250 people.
[00:25:10] But there's a lot of people that wanted to be a pilot.
[00:25:12] So the math was certainly not in my favor.
[00:25:14] And that was another challenge of, yeah, you got to do well.
[00:25:17] I mean, you get ranked and graded on everything.
[00:25:19] Physical fitness, your leadership ability, your academics.
[00:25:22] You get peer reviewed, your peers rate you,
[00:25:25] and you know, anonymously, and what they think of you.
[00:25:26] So you got basically six months to get after it.
[00:25:29] And at the end, they line you up, 250 people,
[00:25:32] in a line, this is a real line.
[00:25:35] And you walk into a room and on the room,
[00:25:37] there's a board.
[00:25:38] And whatever job is available, you can pick.
[00:25:41] Now, the Marine Corps does the same called quality spread
[00:25:45] where they basically cut the class in third,
[00:25:47] so at a 250 folks, 80, 80, 80, or something around there,
[00:25:51] the number one guy picks, and then number 81 guy picks,
[00:25:53] and then the number 161 guy picks, whatever it is.
[00:25:56] And then the number two guy picks.
[00:25:59] The only job in the Marine Corps that they did not
[00:26:00] quality spread was that the basics school was pilot.
[00:26:03] So it was going to be the first two guys out of the gate
[00:26:07] that wanted it, that we're qualified, we're going to get it.
[00:26:09] And I got the number two spot.
[00:26:12] So again, it was one of those things that I was starting
[00:26:16] to in my mind realize, well, this I can do this.
[00:26:20] I built this thing up when I wanted to do.
[00:26:22] I'm 21 now, 22, I think actually.
[00:26:24] So it's six years of my life that I've been sort of
[00:26:27] singularly dedicated to.
[00:26:28] And it's so that day where my platoon commander,
[00:26:31] guy named John Marion, I'll never forget it.
[00:26:32] He was an F-18 pilot.
[00:26:34] Bring to me, it was office.
[00:26:35] It's like Dave, you're going to be a pilot.
[00:26:38] And I think you're going to fly America's airplane.
[00:26:40] You're going to fly the F-18 Hornet.
[00:26:43] It was an awesome day, man.
[00:26:44] And I want, I want to ever forget it.
[00:26:47] And that was it.
[00:26:49] I got my ticket.
[00:26:51] When I was selected for a pilot, I was ranked, I think,
[00:26:55] like number eight and a 250 in my company.
[00:26:57] And by the time I graduated like three weeks later,
[00:27:00] I was like 25 and a 250.
[00:27:02] So my performance might have declined a little bit after I had achieved
[00:27:06] that.
[00:27:07] So in the theory of no slack.
[00:27:08] Yeah, there was a little slack in that line.
[00:27:10] The line was pretty tight for a lot of years.
[00:27:12] For six years.
[00:27:13] Yeah.
[00:27:14] Got it.
[00:27:14] So a little bit of slack there at the end.
[00:27:16] But I did finish well enough to get that pilot.
[00:27:20] Which is what I always wanted.
[00:27:21] It was kind of my dream.
[00:27:22] What year was that?
[00:27:23] That was April of 1995.
[00:27:25] So I started the basic school in October of 1994.
[00:27:28] Right after I got a graduate in college in June,
[00:27:30] little delay to get down to Quantico for the basic school.
[00:27:33] That's six months long.
[00:27:34] I graduated sometime in mid-April.
[00:27:35] Well, well, about this time in 1995.
[00:27:38] So.
[00:27:40] And then you had a flight school.
[00:27:41] Yeah.
[00:27:42] You'd do the rag.
[00:27:43] You'd do all that stuff to get out to a squad.
[00:27:45] And then the first kind of work you were doing was
[00:27:47] Southern Watch, right?
[00:27:49] Yeah.
[00:27:49] So I get through a flight school and pick an F-A-Teen.
[00:27:51] I get stationed at El Toro.
[00:27:53] So I am literally living the dream.
[00:27:55] I'm back to my hometown.
[00:27:59] I think I went to like my tenure high school reunion.
[00:28:02] And I had told all my buddies, you know,
[00:28:03] I wanted to do a run into some people I hadn't seen
[00:28:06] in the whiles.
[00:28:07] It was good.
[00:28:08] And shortly after I got there, I actually flew the last flight
[00:28:12] at El Toro.
[00:28:12] They closed the base and all the Marines moved down
[00:28:14] to Miramar.
[00:28:14] So the Navy, where Topkin was filmed and all that stuff
[00:28:17] back in the day, the Navy left San Diego.
[00:28:20] Move back east and the Marine Corps happily took over
[00:28:22] that base.
[00:28:22] And so I moved down to Miramar and it up in an F-A-Teen squadron.
[00:28:26] Station to Miramar, flying, Hornets off carriers.
[00:28:29] Straight up, living in June.
[00:28:31] I mean, actual dream you are now living in this time.
[00:28:33] That's exactly right.
[00:28:36] I'm living in San Diego.
[00:28:38] I was living in PB off and in Kappa.
[00:28:41] And Station to Miramar, flying Hornets.
[00:28:44] And the carrier that I was assigned to,
[00:28:47] my first deployment, we did Operation Southern Watch.
[00:28:49] So, you know, I watched Desert Storm in 91 on TV.
[00:28:53] I was in freshman in college.
[00:28:55] And we hadn't done much in the military since then,
[00:28:58] but we had flown every single day
[00:29:00] since that war ended.
[00:29:01] And I think it was March of 91.
[00:29:04] Every single day since then, we flew patrols over Iraq
[00:29:07] to make sure that the skies were clear.
[00:29:09] And we were enforcing the no-fly zone.
[00:29:11] And here it was, you know, 10 years later, 2000 on a carrier
[00:29:15] in the Persian Gulf, flying combat operations over Southern Iraq.
[00:29:21] Did you guys ever drop me bombs, huh?
[00:29:23] I did.
[00:29:24] Yeah, a few of us did.
[00:29:24] Not a ton.
[00:29:25] There wasn't a ton going on, but what we would do,
[00:29:26] these things called response options.
[00:29:27] So if that Iraq is we'd do something, I think, in my case,
[00:29:29] they set up a surface air missile, south of a line
[00:29:32] that they weren't supposed to be.
[00:29:33] And we had surveillance at told us what was out there.
[00:29:35] And I launched an omission on Blupper, a SAMHSAite,
[00:29:39] with something called a J-Dam at the time.
[00:29:40] It was a bomb guided by GPS, which at the time was this brand new
[00:29:44] operation.
[00:29:45] Yeah, it was crazy technology.
[00:29:46] I think we were on the only planes in the entire carrier
[00:29:48] that could do it, because we had this thing called a GPS,
[00:29:50] super fancy back then.
[00:29:53] But at the time, J-Dam, that was combat.
[00:29:55] That was, there was no other show in town.
[00:29:58] And so then I dropped a bomb on a SAMHSAite in Iraq,
[00:30:03] off a carrier in an F-18.
[00:30:06] You could have just retired there.
[00:30:08] We're done here to go.
[00:30:09] I could have come back to that.
[00:30:11] It could have flown me off the ship.
[00:30:13] And I probably would have died a happy man at that point.
[00:30:15] That's it.
[00:30:16] I have reached critical mass.
[00:30:17] That's all I ever wanted to do.
[00:30:18] So it was, again, a lot of it was just things
[00:30:23] worked out of my favor, but I did exactly what I wanted to do
[00:30:26] when that event was kind of at the time, sort of the pinnacle.
[00:30:28] That was what I thought I was going to achieve.
[00:30:30] Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing in the dry years
[00:30:31] for the seal teams.
[00:30:32] Like if you did some kind of mission, you were just super stoked.
[00:30:37] We were over in the Persian Gulf.
[00:30:39] Actually, at the same time, 1999, 2000, I was there.
[00:30:43] I was in the Persian Gulf when we were doing, you know, meal operations, stop
[00:30:47] and smugglers coming out of Iraq.
[00:30:48] So we were taking down vessels and getting control of them.
[00:30:51] And again, at the time, super stoked.
[00:30:55] Yes, the big mission was taking out these vessels.
[00:30:57] And it thought it was pretty cool.
[00:30:58] And it was cool.
[00:30:59] But you just didn't have anything to compare it to at all.
[00:31:03] Yeah.
[00:31:04] So what happened?
[00:31:06] So I get back from that deployment.
[00:31:08] That's the summer of 2000.
[00:31:11] And shortly after that, I got selected by my commanding officer to go to Top Gun.
[00:31:16] So that was my first exposure to kind of advancing inside the squadron.
[00:31:20] So as a young guy, I've done almost two years in the squadron.
[00:31:22] I've been there for a little while and got some qualifications and grew and developed
[00:31:25] in the squadron.
[00:31:26] And they pick one or two guys every couple years from me,
[00:31:29] every squadron to go to the school and the whole point of going there is a U-Learn kind
[00:31:33] of this advanced, you know, it's like a master's degree basically in being a fighter pilot
[00:31:37] with the intent that you can bring back to the squadron and be one of the kind of key trainers
[00:31:41] a key leaders in the squadron.
[00:31:42] So I went to Top Gun early the next year, summer of, actually about a year later.
[00:31:47] So summer 2001, I got to Top Gun and I came back and we were just in a work outside.
[00:31:53] You showed up to Top Gun just sort of really knows.
[00:31:56] Yeah.
[00:31:57] I mean, especially because you were the big combat vet with bombs dropped and you feel
[00:32:02] like you're pretty much a complete stud.
[00:32:05] Yeah.
[00:32:06] And then you show up at Top Gun and the instructors just can completely annihilate.
[00:32:10] And just, first of all, as you don't know, it's, it's, you're learning how to dog fight
[00:32:13] mono, e mono against another guy and another plane like stock car racing because the
[00:32:20] planes are equal and it's you against the other guy and it was actually cool.
[00:32:24] You were explaining some of the rules and how you'd set it up and they have, you know,
[00:32:28] and you did, you know, you, you, you, you, okay, you know, you start standing, you know,
[00:32:32] you shake hands, bomb fist, I can now it's on.
[00:32:33] Well, with the Top Gun, they started a certain distance.
[00:32:36] They, they go towards each other at a certain altitude, certain distance away from each
[00:32:39] other.
[00:32:40] They go, they pass it a thousand feet, you know, left, left wing to left wing.
[00:32:44] And then once they pass, they say, what do you say?
[00:32:46] Game on fights on fights on fights on and then boom, now it's go.
[00:32:50] So that's how they start in their neutral position.
[00:32:53] And of course, when you show up there, it's just like you did to, in the fact that it's
[00:32:58] like a guy that did a little bit of training somewhere and then they show up at a G.
[00:33:02] G. G. G. G. G. G. and they're going to get totally destroyed.
[00:33:04] So he shows up, you show up at this thing.
[00:33:06] Yeah.
[00:33:07] And, and you think you're, again, big combat that you just get annihilated.
[00:33:11] Totally.
[00:33:12] So yeah, I get that I had dropped a bomb, that's singular.
[00:33:14] I had dropped a bomb and bomb.
[00:33:16] And I was, I was, I was a big deal.
[00:33:19] I do that dropped a bomb, you know, and so at the time I was, I, I thought,
[00:33:22] some of the instructors had never done that before, right?
[00:33:24] Most of them, like you said, there's the drier.
[00:33:26] So it just wasn't a ton going on.
[00:33:27] You had a story here and there, but I think more than anything in my own mind, you
[00:33:31] kind of build up like I got some game here, man.
[00:33:33] I'm going to watch this.
[00:33:35] You know, I'm going to do some good work here.
[00:33:37] And, you know, I done well enough of my squadron.
[00:33:39] And I was one of the guys that got picked to go to school, so you,
[00:33:41] which is another little confidence boost.
[00:33:43] Yeah, it is.
[00:33:44] So your egos getting fed.
[00:33:45] It's getting forced fed.
[00:33:47] Maybe.
[00:33:48] Yeah, a little bit.
[00:33:49] Yeah, you're feeling pretty good about yourself.
[00:33:51] And so you go up there.
[00:33:53] And like you said, so you know, you're, you're a student, you know,
[00:33:58] you're not going to be as good as the instructors, but what you don't know is that
[00:34:01] you're not just going to lose, you're going to get, you're not just going to lose
[00:34:05] or get annihilated, you're not even going to know what happened.
[00:34:06] It's going to be over and you're going to kind of be flying back and before you,
[00:34:09] you're going to land and you're not going to be able to explain what just occurred.
[00:34:12] I mean, it occurs in a way that it's so, it's hard to explain.
[00:34:16] It's like you weren't there.
[00:34:18] It's really, it's humbling.
[00:34:21] I mean, Jacob, we're talking the very first flight on the very first day.
[00:34:26] My very first event, the very first flight of the first flight.
[00:34:29] It was over in like 20 seconds in the instructor was saying, okay, let's call it and say,
[00:34:34] knock it off when we're done.
[00:34:35] We're going to start and set it up again.
[00:34:36] And any right then, I was totally in over my head.
[00:34:38] The very first one.
[00:34:40] And it was so my first flight was, it was so bad that when I landed, we're walking back
[00:34:46] in to, you go to maintenance and you basically go back and turn the airplane back in and
[00:34:50] so they can fix it and then what you're supposed to just walk across through to the squadron
[00:34:54] hanger and talk about it.
[00:34:56] And I'm in my gear and you're supposed to get on dress out of your flight gear and go
[00:34:58] and he's like, hey, don't get on dress.
[00:35:01] And we're going, right?
[00:35:02] Right?
[00:35:03] Right?
[00:35:04] He's like, why don't we just go do that again?
[00:35:05] It was bad enough that we didn't even need to talk about it.
[00:35:07] We just needed to just, hey, and he's like, hey, why don't you just take a deep breath, man?
[00:35:12] And we went and did that flight without even talking about the first one.
[00:35:18] So I kind of knew I had some work to do.
[00:35:22] So top gun is really good about not just humbling you, but obviously it teaches you a
[00:35:27] ton.
[00:35:28] It's a six at the time.
[00:35:29] It was only six weeks for the Marines because we didn't do some of the syllabus that
[00:35:33] the Navy did because we got it elsewhere.
[00:35:36] And it's six weeks where you start with literally just you against another guy, one against
[00:35:39] one and you end up building up to where it's, you know, six to eight of you on the front,
[00:35:44] on the blue side, the friendly side against, you know, 15, 20 simulated adversary.
[00:35:49] So it's a, it's a, a lot in a short period of time.
[00:35:52] And that idea of being like really bad when you start happens over and over again in the
[00:35:57] course.
[00:35:58] So you get through the one V1 phase and at the end, like, oh, finally I got this one V1 thing.
[00:36:00] I got this thing wired.
[00:36:01] I can do this.
[00:36:02] Like, all right, cool.
[00:36:03] And I'm going to go two against whatever and you just get rolled again.
[00:36:06] And you're like, I'm back to square one.
[00:36:08] So it builds you up and breaks you down and builds you up, standard military, you know,
[00:36:12] just breaks you down to your pieces.
[00:36:14] And then the guys there that instructors are so, they're obviously really good.
[00:36:18] I mean, that part is sort of speaks for yourself.
[00:36:20] They're really good on the airplane.
[00:36:21] But what makes them unique is that they're exceptional teachers.
[00:36:24] So you learn a ton.
[00:36:25] So by the time, a lot of the time you finished up gun, that, that image in the mirror, we
[00:36:29] know like, man, that dude was awesome.
[00:36:30] They get shattered.
[00:36:31] It's actually all back together by the time you leave.
[00:36:33] And as you leave there, like, you got that patch in your shoulder.
[00:36:36] You fly back, you get the patch in the last day, you get up in your airplane, F-18 with
[00:36:40] my name, Pan on the side with the top gun patch and I flew back to Merrimar.
[00:36:42] See, you dream is getting better.
[00:36:47] But there's been enough reminders.
[00:36:49] Like, yeah, I should probably maybe cool out a little bit.
[00:36:53] You start to just learn that there's always guys out there that are significantly better
[00:36:56] than you.
[00:36:57] And you keep climbing up the hill.
[00:36:59] But finishing top gun as a student, you feel like you've hit the top of the mountain,
[00:37:02] but you realize, because the guys you've been working with, there's an awful long
[00:37:06] way to go.
[00:37:07] You at least know what you don't know.
[00:37:08] Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
[00:37:09] You know what you don't know.
[00:37:11] And you're there's a lot that you don't know.
[00:37:12] And so it kind of dispels all those feeling.
[00:37:14] You know, we went through flight school.
[00:37:15] Like, wow, I'm a finished flight school.
[00:37:17] I got to F-18s.
[00:37:18] I've really got this flying thing nail.
[00:37:20] And you're barely functional in your plane compared to these other guys.
[00:37:24] And when you get to a place like top gun, it's just such a concentration of talent.
[00:37:29] You, it's good as it feels.
[00:37:31] You actually, the thing you get the most out of the humility, because you just got crushed
[00:37:34] for six weeks.
[00:37:35] And hopefully you learned something out of it.
[00:37:37] And you're supposed to take that back and teach the guys in your squadron all those
[00:37:41] same lessons.
[00:37:42] And so my expectation was I was going to go back from top gun.
[00:37:44] I was going to spend another two years, 18 months in the squadron as a kind of the senior
[00:37:49] instructors.
[00:37:50] And then go on to something else.
[00:37:52] And I didn't know exactly what that was at the time.
[00:37:56] But as I'm leaving, no joke.
[00:37:57] My last day, I remember the guy who asked me, is actually the same guy that's going
[00:38:01] to do my retirement here in a couple months.
[00:38:02] I came out of you, thought about coming back to being instructor top gun after this
[00:38:07] tour in your squadron's over.
[00:38:09] And I try to play a cool, like, oh, let me go home and think about that.
[00:38:12] But clearly, there wasn't a lot to think about there.
[00:38:16] So I left there with kind of an inclination that I might get asked back.
[00:38:19] And I was pretty stoked about that.
[00:38:21] They didn't formalize it.
[00:38:22] But he was a senior IP on the staff, the senior Marine there as well.
[00:38:27] A real respected guy in Marine aviation.
[00:38:29] And he had given me a sit down.
[00:38:30] So I was hoping that that was going to happen.
[00:38:32] But I also thought I had time.
[00:38:33] I thought I was, this is July 2001.
[00:38:36] And obviously six weeks later, 9-11 hits.
[00:38:40] And so all that calculus kind of changed.
[00:38:42] And very quickly, my squadron, which was on this regular cycle of preparing to go to,
[00:38:47] what was going to be another Southern Watch deployment, just like we did, that whole thing
[00:38:51] had changed.
[00:38:53] Because of September 11th.
[00:38:55] So what happens on September 11th for you?
[00:38:58] Yeah, you were active in a squadron getting ready for work in the morning.
[00:39:03] Totally.
[00:39:04] I'm stationed right up the road here.
[00:39:06] Five miles north of the air is a ringer station, Miramar.
[00:39:08] I'm on my second half of my first tour as a pilot and a 182-ajron.
[00:39:13] I'd already done that one deployment.
[00:39:15] And I had a routine down.
[00:39:17] I was getting up.
[00:39:18] I was probably, I guess it was probably five in the morning.
[00:39:20] I'm sitting at the foot of my bed, listening to my boots.
[00:39:22] I could did every day to just get in the car and drive into work and click on the TV.
[00:39:25] And I see, we've stayed at a clock back east around that time and I see what's going on.
[00:39:31] And I think, you know, same story for all this kind of piece of together very quickly.
[00:39:34] Hey, this is an accident.
[00:39:35] This is something's really happening.
[00:39:36] You can see the second building.
[00:39:37] And it, very quickly, kind of, clicks in like, this is the real thing.
[00:39:42] And I knew, I knew we were going to go to war.
[00:39:45] I didn't know what, I obviously didn't know the details, but I knew things were going
[00:39:48] to change really dramatically.
[00:39:49] As a matter of fact, my drive to work, which normally would have taken me 10 minutes or
[00:39:53] never 15 minutes, something short drive to get up into the base.
[00:39:57] It was like three hours to get on the base, you know, they're inspecting it, reviical, you know,
[00:40:01] every car getting pulled over, dodgers, you know, the whole nine yards that just the security.
[00:40:05] It was pretty chaotic.
[00:40:07] He was kind of mayhem.
[00:40:09] And I drive into my squadron and half of my squadron had already not half, but a good number
[00:40:14] of guys that already been up to Fallen, which was where we're going to go for training.
[00:40:17] The same place the top one is, it was just part of a normal training cycle.
[00:40:21] My squadron commander at the time, an awesome guy called me because he'd gone up there.
[00:40:26] And I was supposed to bring the, you know, be part of the second half of that went up there.
[00:40:29] He's like, hey man, you need to go brief.
[00:40:32] You're going to be the lead of a foreship of aircraft.
[00:40:35] We don't know all the details yet, but we're going to, they're going to call you, they're
[00:40:38] going to find live ordinance.
[00:40:39] And you're going to have to fly an air patrol, a common air patrol mission called
[00:40:44] of the cap, because there are still a bunch of airliners that were still airborne coming
[00:40:48] in from places like Japan and Korea these long haul, you know, 12, 13, 14, our flights.
[00:40:52] There's a whole bunch of airplanes airborne.
[00:40:54] And we didn't know if those, there's potential issue with those airplanes.
[00:40:58] You know, if they're going to try to do the same thing back east of the day, that west, total
[00:41:01] chaos.
[00:41:02] And I had just recently graduated from Topkins, so I was like, hey, you're the lead.
[00:41:06] And we didn't have a good, we didn't know what the mission was.
[00:41:08] I mean, it was basically one of those things where we're supposed to get airborne and somehow
[00:41:13] between us and some other control, we're going to kind of determine if a particular aircraft
[00:41:16] might have been a threat.
[00:41:17] And now has happened all over the country.
[00:41:19] People were in their aircraft Air Force Navy Marine pilots who were just launching to do
[00:41:23] these protection missions of what ended becoming something called Operation Noble Eagle,
[00:41:28] which started on September 11th.
[00:41:30] And it was this aviation overwatch of key cities and key locations.
[00:41:35] And we were totally clueless on what that was.
[00:41:37] Now, I ended up not launching, but it didn't happen.
[00:41:40] You know, but we did the brief, we were getting ready to go.
[00:41:43] It was just kind of that moment of chaos of we were on our heels and talking didn't prepare
[00:41:49] me for that.
[00:41:50] I didn't have a sense of what it was to do with an airliner, you know, filled with civilians
[00:41:55] on some route coming from Japan and trying to figure out what I would do.
[00:41:58] If somebody said, hey, that aircraft, we've figured out that aircraft is going to try
[00:42:01] to fly into a building or crash into an airport or something like that.
[00:42:05] It was just, you know, just kind of mayhem and it was, you know, it's tough to start off.
[00:42:09] The idea being that if that is suspected of happening or they can somehow confirm that's
[00:42:15] going to happen, then you or one of your mates is going to have to shoot down a civilian
[00:42:21] aircraft.
[00:42:22] That's what they're thinking.
[00:42:23] Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:24] And that was something I never considered.
[00:42:27] Um, you know, there's anybody to consider that at that point.
[00:42:30] And I've read there's some, you know, there's some pilots that actually ended up launching
[00:42:33] out in the East Coast.
[00:42:34] I've read a couple articles of pilots that took off in their F-16s here in DC, because
[00:42:38] obviously it was with the Pentagon up in DC in the New York City that actually did get airborne
[00:42:44] and they had missions to do exactly that.
[00:42:47] Um, so in some sense, I was pretty lucky that I didn't have to go through that calculus,
[00:42:50] but I still can picture where I'm sitting, given that brief with three other pilots, kind
[00:42:53] of like we're sitting today.
[00:42:56] And we're even asking ourselves, like, well, how do you, I mean, how do you shoot down an
[00:43:00] airline?
[00:43:01] You know, what, what would we actually go through to do?
[00:43:03] How do we determine, you know, when we were talking, kind of trying to talk through that
[00:43:07] and the idea that an airliner filled with civilians, and we knew, you know, at that
[00:43:12] point that those other airliners are regular commercial airplanes that just took off,
[00:43:15] they're going their flight and they crash, we knew everybody on board, you know, nobody's
[00:43:19] going to survive that.
[00:43:20] And so it was just a very strange way to start what ended up being kind of a cycle of war
[00:43:25] that, you know, we've all been through for years now, that morning of getting that call
[00:43:29] from the CO, hey, this is what you're doing.
[00:43:30] And, you know, that was the beginning.
[00:43:33] Shortly, very shortly that route within a day or two, no, actually, I think probably that
[00:43:37] late afternoon, and certainly by the next day, my squadron was one of the several squadrons
[00:43:42] that was tasked to go back out on the carrier.
[00:43:43] So we split the squadron in half.
[00:43:45] That same CO that called me, he took guys from Fallon flew onto the ship onto the carrier,
[00:43:50] right off the coast of LAX.
[00:43:52] And I still, we, we talked about this.
[00:43:54] I can picture to this day.
[00:43:55] I took off at San Diego and flying overhead, Los Angeles International Airport, and we had guys
[00:44:00] that taken off in the carrier that had life missiles, and they were doing a cap, and I'm
[00:44:04] flying, you know, kind of opposite direction overhead, LAX looking down, and, you know,
[00:44:08] I grew up in San Diego, where LAX, like one of the busiest airports in the world, planes
[00:44:12] all over the tarmac on the runways, on the taxiways, because there's, everybody landed,
[00:44:16] nobody took off.
[00:44:17] There's no controllers.
[00:44:18] And they're doing this cap mission, where they're just flying overhead, LAX, kind
[00:44:22] of largely unknown what's going on, and just that moment of seriality of, I'm airborne.
[00:44:27] And there's nobody else flying.
[00:44:29] And we're just sort of just waiting for something to happen, and, you know, it's kind
[00:44:33] of one of those, hey, you'll get more specific instructions as we figure it out.
[00:44:37] You know, the leadership was, was scrambling, everybody's much as we were, and kind of
[00:44:40] looking down, thinking this is, this is a whole new world.
[00:44:44] You know, this is not Southern Watch, you know, that mission we've been doing.
[00:44:48] And within, maybe six weeks, we, we steamed out.
[00:44:53] We, we, we loaded the carrier a couple months early, put the squadron, the whole air wing,
[00:44:57] got on board the, the carrier and steamed out towards the North of the Rivian Gulf to go
[00:45:02] do what we call it as Operation during Freedom.
[00:45:05] So late 2001, I think it was maybe November of 2001.
[00:45:09] We were going to war.
[00:45:11] And our Afghanistan was where the war was.
[00:45:13] You remember at the time, that was it.
[00:45:15] There was nothing else going on.
[00:45:16] We went to Afghanistan.
[00:45:17] So I did a seven month cruise on a carrier from November of 2001.
[00:45:24] I think we came back April May of 2002 and did combat operations over Afghanistan.
[00:45:30] And, you know, a lot more rewarding.
[00:45:32] And so a lot of this year, we did a mission at the time.
[00:45:34] It was called Operation Anaconda.
[00:45:35] I think I'm going to ask you about that.
[00:45:36] That was like the largest ground offensive.
[00:45:38] Yeah.
[00:45:39] We had supported this desert storm.
[00:45:41] And when we came back in April, April, May of 2002, we thought we'd sort of largely
[00:45:48] won the war.
[00:45:49] We, we thought we'd accomplished most of our mission.
[00:45:50] We left thinking, hey, this thing is winding down. We're feeling pretty good about it.
[00:45:54] And when I got back in May of 2002, I kind of distinctly remember, like, I just had my
[00:45:59] work experience.
[00:46:00] You know, as a pilot in combat, and you know, I'd done so to watch, but obviously, you
[00:46:03] know, nothing like this.
[00:46:04] And, but I'd done a combat deployment off of carrier.
[00:46:07] You're supported troops on the ground and Afghanistan dropping bombs and flying off
[00:46:11] cars.
[00:46:12] I kind of thought that was it.
[00:46:13] I think a lot of us did.
[00:46:14] Yeah, a lot of us did.
[00:46:16] I know I thought that might come back from my first deployment to Iraq.
[00:46:19] I was kind of, you know, I'm thankful that I got to do this deployment.
[00:46:24] And I thought they can't go on that much longer.
[00:46:26] But I mean, really quickly, after we got back, it spiraled and I said, oh, this is going
[00:46:30] to be a while.
[00:46:31] Yeah, big time.
[00:46:33] You know, while I was on that deployment, I had gotten email from Top Gun.
[00:46:38] I was saying, hey, I want to come up here next summer, being a structure.
[00:46:42] So I came back in May of that deployment, knowing that my next step was going to go back
[00:46:47] up to Fallen.
[00:46:49] I was feeling pretty good about that.
[00:46:50] I was pretty pumped to know what was next.
[00:46:52] And, you know, in that period of time, it came back, you know, I'm packing up that summer
[00:46:58] and moving out in the fall and already the gears are starting to turn for what end to
[00:47:02] be an operation Iraqi freedom.
[00:47:04] You know, it's the writing is on the wall that this is, we're not done.
[00:47:07] I mean, we're really just getting started.
[00:47:08] And it was several months before that I'll kick off.
[00:47:11] I think everybody in the military certainly knew this is which way it's going to happen.
[00:47:15] And I think there are some things along the way that we're supposed to occur.
[00:47:18] But we all knew this was coming.
[00:47:20] Certainly, you know, it kicked off in March of the fall of the year.
[00:47:23] It wasn't a big surprise to any of us.
[00:47:25] And I was up at Fallen.
[00:47:26] Kind of watching that whole thing roll and I realized that that deployment that I just
[00:47:30] finished was not the end of what we were doing as a country and trying to deal with this
[00:47:34] problem.
[00:47:35] And then you show up at Top Gun to be an instructor, which is, you know, you said the
[00:47:40] going to Top Gun was like a masters.
[00:47:42] And so now it's beyond a doctorate, right?
[00:47:45] I mean, it's.
[00:47:46] Yeah, and we say it's the PhD.
[00:47:48] I mean, in our business, certainly is a for a Marine or naval aviator of fighter pilot.
[00:47:52] That's it.
[00:47:53] Top Gun kind of represents the schoolhouse.
[00:47:56] It's the place where you want to be.
[00:47:58] And as an instructor, you have a huge amount of responsibility.
[00:48:01] It's a bunch of sort of mid career guys.
[00:48:04] It's Navy Lieutenant.
[00:48:05] It's Marine Corps captains.
[00:48:06] Maybe a junior major or a junior lieutenant commander.
[00:48:09] But it's run by relatively young guys.
[00:48:13] As a head maybe a full deployment under the belt, you know, quickly guys were coming
[00:48:16] and having done Afghanistan, combat operations.
[00:48:18] Guys coming having done Iraq, combat operations.
[00:48:21] So in the time that I was there from O2 to O5, the combat experience on the staff went
[00:48:26] from basically none to everybody.
[00:48:29] Everybody.
[00:48:30] Every single dude had been in combat.
[00:48:31] It was coming off a long deployment where they had done back to back to POMISI, Iraq
[00:48:35] and Afghanistan.
[00:48:36] Guys that I knew had done 10 month deployments to Iraq on a carrier.
[00:48:39] I mean, really seasoned guys where just one generation to three years prior, not a single
[00:48:45] person on the staff had seen any combat like that.
[00:48:48] So these acts same thing in the sealed teams we experienced, exact same thing.
[00:48:52] Going from zero or close to zero combat experiencing that it's an odd guy that had done
[00:48:57] little operation here there to every single guy except for the new guys.
[00:49:03] And then, but you're learning curve.
[00:49:06] When you show back up there, it was just as steep as the first time.
[00:49:09] Yeah, without a doubt.
[00:49:10] So when you're there as a student and you don't understand a lot of what's going on
[00:49:15] as a student, at least on the instructor side, you know, they're not trying to keep anything
[00:49:17] from me, but you're just, you were so busy just trying to keep your head above water.
[00:49:22] You're not spending a lot of time wondering what the instructors are doing at the free time.
[00:49:25] You're just prepping for every brief, the flight may take an hour, but you've put in
[00:49:31] 10 hours of work ahead of time and you've debrief for six hours and when you're done,
[00:49:35] you need to go start the next prep process again for you.
[00:49:37] So you are just all day, every day thinking about your next flight and getting ready for
[00:49:43] that and the thing is going on.
[00:49:44] So in your learning curve as steep as a student, when you get there as an instructor
[00:49:48] and I didn't know this at the time, you get there.
[00:49:51] When you're there as an instructor, you have certainly been selected to a pretty elite
[00:49:55] group of folks, but you don't teach a student at Topkin when you're an instructor for a year.
[00:50:02] They spend an entire year with you as an instructor.
[00:50:05] There's only 25 guys on the staff.
[00:50:07] So a third of you basically, if you kind of do the math or sequester for an entire year,
[00:50:10] just going through what's called, we call it the IUT, the instructor under training.
[00:50:14] And they're just teaching you how to teach students.
[00:50:18] And in that year, you're now flying all these different training missions with the instructors
[00:50:23] that are training you to be instructor and you're getting annihilated again.
[00:50:27] So that whole continuum of, well, I'm pretty good.
[00:50:31] You were reminded very quickly.
[00:50:32] And so it takes an entire year.
[00:50:34] And now the good news about that is that by the time you're finishing your initial instructor
[00:50:37] qualification, you can go teach students.
[00:50:40] You have been flying more than you've ever flown in your territory.
[00:50:44] I mean, I'm flying two, three times a day sometimes for a year.
[00:50:48] And so you're just getting reps and reps and reps.
[00:50:50] And you have got more reps, I think, than anybody in aviation.
[00:50:54] So when the time you get your first student is sitting down, you're very first student brief.
[00:50:57] Your A game has been elevated, you know, quite a bit.
[00:51:00] And you're able to fly with the students and teach them way more effective week as,
[00:51:05] when I finished top gun, I went to Afghanistan.
[00:51:07] I didn't do a single air to air mission for almost a year.
[00:51:10] I was dropping bombs.
[00:51:11] I was doing cast and, oh, those are other type of missions.
[00:51:14] So when I got there, I was, I was pretty rusty on the skill sets.
[00:51:18] A year of flying with instructors will resolve that.
[00:51:21] Pretty much.
[00:51:22] Just the amount of flying that you get, you know, in just a week called Matt time.
[00:51:27] But for a normal pilot, you're not even getting a fraction of that, right?
[00:51:32] A fraction.
[00:51:33] Not only you're not getting a fraction of it, a lot of the time that you're flying is when
[00:51:38] you're not a top gun is, you know, sometimes you do an admin flying just flying two
[00:51:41] and from different places.
[00:51:42] Sometimes you're just prepping for a very particular mission.
[00:51:45] You know, it takes a skill to, you know, the missions are getting ready to drop bombs or do
[00:51:49] armor, condits, and so different types of flying.
[00:51:52] You don't get to see all of it.
[00:51:53] You get to see a pretty narrow amount of top gun.
[00:51:56] You get exposed to everything repeatedly.
[00:51:59] And so that one against one that we talked about, that we call BFM, basic fighter maneuvers,
[00:52:02] which is just you and another guy fighting two airplanes.
[00:52:06] You do that a ton, but you do all the other things just as much.
[00:52:10] So you get exposed to the PhD part of it isn't just the reps.
[00:52:15] I think that's critical.
[00:52:17] But it's that you get exposed to this nuanced part of aviation that you just didn't even
[00:52:21] really know existed.
[00:52:22] So you get all the science, all the math, all the things that drive us to say this, why
[00:52:26] would do the things we do, then just get to practice it over and over and then you go back
[00:52:31] to the science and go, hey, I think there's some flaws here.
[00:52:33] Maybe some differences here.
[00:52:34] And the guys at top, kind of the one writing the manual.
[00:52:37] We literally write a manual for inches thick of all these different chapters of how to fly
[00:52:43] the airplane.
[00:52:44] Everything from doing the one against one to dropping a bomb to mission planning, top
[00:52:47] gun owns that.
[00:52:48] Even a chapter in a book and a lecture that I was responsible for and the thing that was
[00:52:53] pretty amazing for me is when I got there, the mission set that I was responsible for
[00:52:58] my, my smear area, my subject matter, X-ray area was surface air threat and counter tactics.
[00:53:02] So I was the guy as a captain in the Marine Corps that was responsible for writing the
[00:53:06] chapter teaching the lecture and establishing our tactics for how to defeat threat surface
[00:53:11] air missiles in AAA.
[00:53:14] This was from September of 2002 to March 2003 that I was the guy that established the
[00:53:22] Navy Marine Corps's procedures and techniques and how we did that and taught that.
[00:53:25] So you know, I'm sorry, oh, I have kicks off.
[00:53:29] You know, guys that I'm, I had fun with and trained with or out there on deployments
[00:53:32] or write me letters.
[00:53:33] Hey, we're seeing this threat.
[00:53:35] What should we do here?
[00:53:36] You know, buddies of mine that I've grown up in aviation, I'm saying, hey, this is what
[00:53:39] we should do.
[00:53:40] This is how you should do with this particular case.
[00:53:42] So the responsibility as an IP, I think why is such a PhD type program is that your
[00:53:47] level responsibility grows, you have to be more than just a good pilot.
[00:53:50] You can teach anybody a good pilot, but if you can't teach and explain to other guys what
[00:53:54] they're doing and how to get better and how to keep themselves alive, you're kind of useless
[00:53:57] in combat.
[00:53:59] So it was a, it was, it was the best way or some of my life, man.
[00:54:03] It was, it was ridiculous.
[00:54:05] And we just flew every day, two, three times a day.
[00:54:08] I got qualified in the F-16.
[00:54:10] I got to fly a totally different airplane.
[00:54:11] So I was dual-qualled in an F-18 and an NF-16 as a Marine on a Navy base at a Navy command
[00:54:17] after having done two deployments on carriers.
[00:54:19] I mean, you cannot.
[00:54:21] It'd be like if I said, I need you to do jujitsu three days, two times a day, every day
[00:54:25] for three years.
[00:54:27] And you need, and that's all I need you to do.
[00:54:28] I don't need you to do anything else.
[00:54:30] Yeah.
[00:54:31] You know, I've actually done a Baxy ride in F-18 at Fowl and as a matter of fact.
[00:54:35] And one of the things that I think is important to understand, or at least from my perspective,
[00:54:39] one of the things that made it really cool was when you get an F-18, if you've never been
[00:54:44] in one, most people, you're not going to get the chance to get an F-18.
[00:54:46] And fly with it, right?
[00:54:47] So I'll give a little description of what I thought was one of the coolest parts about it.
[00:54:51] Is that if you look at the structure of an F-18, the, the, the pod that you sit in, the cockpit,
[00:54:57] is really far forward and the wings and the engine and our stuff are behind you.
[00:55:02] And it looks that way when you look at it, but when you get in it, you, those, those wings
[00:55:07] are so far behind you that you feel like you're in a superhero pod.
[00:55:11] You need to turn, you need to turn hard.
[00:55:15] You can't just look back to see the wings and it's a glass canopy that surrounds you.
[00:55:20] So you feel like you're just in a little pod that is moving at whatever, 800 miles an hour.
[00:55:27] And it's, it's, it's a, it's a crazy feeling.
[00:55:29] It's a crazy feeling because, because you're, it's deceiving because you just feel like you're
[00:55:35] in this little space pod.
[00:55:37] Somehow Star Wars powering through the air.
[00:55:39] You don't realize it behind you is, you know, tons of metal and machinery that's making
[00:55:43] this happen.
[00:55:44] And the G-force isn't all that stuff.
[00:55:47] It's, it's, it's, it's a very cool, very cool thing to experience.
[00:55:51] For me, I, I thought, yeah, that was awesome.
[00:55:53] I didn't think to myself, man, I should have been a pilot.
[00:55:56] There's some, there's some, I know you, we were talking about it yesterday.
[00:56:00] For you, the connection between man and machine is a really cool thing that you enjoy.
[00:56:06] For me, I don't like it.
[00:56:08] I don't like to rely on a machine.
[00:56:11] Yeah.
[00:56:12] I don't even, even get in Bradley's and stuff and Romadi, I always think, you know, I mean,
[00:56:15] I always was apprehensive about a big machine that I had to rely on.
[00:56:17] I don't want to rely on me.
[00:56:19] And what I could do, and that's why I had that little disconnect, I always, I still have
[00:56:24] it today, you know, that's why I'm waiting for the robot works.
[00:56:27] I want, I want to fight those things.
[00:56:30] So I just have a little disconnect with the machines, but I can see where people that
[00:56:36] are, I have that type of mindset.
[00:56:38] It's just, you know, it's just a complete equalizer as you were telling me last night.
[00:56:41] You're just like, it's a stock car race.
[00:56:44] It's you in the same plane as me and who is better is going to win.
[00:56:50] Period.
[00:56:51] That's it.
[00:56:52] There's really no excuses you can make.
[00:56:53] Yeah, that's one of my favorite things.
[00:56:55] It's always been one of my favorite things about flying fighters is that it's an equalizer.
[00:56:59] You don't get, you don't bring any advantage to that airplane.
[00:57:03] Now if we're going to train something, you made, there's guys that are bigger, the guys
[00:57:07] that are better aren't right.
[00:57:08] They got whatever.
[00:57:09] There's a whole bunch of ways that maybe you can bring an advantage.
[00:57:14] You lose all that.
[00:57:15] They've been used to it on that airplane.
[00:57:16] Because you're only going to go as fast as the airplane goes.
[00:57:18] You don't even pull as many jeezes.
[00:57:19] The airplane pulls.
[00:57:20] That's what you get.
[00:57:21] Now, you get a lot of all that stuff.
[00:57:23] I mean, it's awesome.
[00:57:24] But your success or your failure is 100% about how well you interact with that machine
[00:57:30] and compare to that other guy.
[00:57:32] And if you lose, you know, my engine, no.
[00:57:35] Well, I didn't have negative, you lost because you were worse than me today.
[00:57:39] Period.
[00:57:40] And look, you're going to find reasons why.
[00:57:41] We record every flight.
[00:57:43] We record our radar as we record our information, our display.
[00:57:46] So we can go back and dissect.
[00:57:49] And what you end up being able to do as an instructor is right there.
[00:57:52] That's why you lost.
[00:57:53] This decision you made here, this move you went.
[00:57:55] You went this direction or you went up or down.
[00:57:57] You decided to go this speed or whatnot.
[00:57:59] You can dissect every single flight.
[00:58:01] And the great instructors are the ones that can tell you, this is why I did this to you
[00:58:06] in 45 seconds.
[00:58:07] Because here, you made a decision.
[00:58:09] And it took me this long to capitalize it.
[00:58:11] But right now is where I took advantage of a mistake that you made.
[00:58:15] And you freeze that mistake and you put on a TV and they see it and they look at it and
[00:58:18] they burn it in their brain.
[00:58:20] And they make that mistake over and over and over and over and until eventually they don't
[00:58:24] make that mistake.
[00:58:25] And then you start to make your money as an instructor.
[00:58:26] But being an airplane, I brought every bit of capability that airplane had.
[00:58:34] And I never had it.
[00:58:35] There's no, you don't start at a disadvantage.
[00:58:37] And if you beat somebody, they have nobody to look at.
[00:58:40] No excuse.
[00:58:41] Nothing to blame except for their own performance.
[00:58:43] And I loved that.
[00:58:44] And I will always love that about being a fighter pilot.
[00:58:49] And then when you're flying to the left 16, now you have a different airplane.
[00:58:51] So hey, one of the planes faster than the other.
[00:58:54] One airplane actually turns better.
[00:58:55] And so now instead of it just being two totally equal platforms, it's one has particular
[00:59:00] strengths and weaknesses that are different than the other ones.
[00:59:03] So you better be really good about avoiding his strengths and getting, you know, and
[00:59:06] plan to his weaknesses and vice versa.
[00:59:08] And if you lose, guess what?
[00:59:10] It's still your fault.
[00:59:12] 100% because instead of you having two similar airplanes, you couldn't identify what he was
[00:59:17] able to do better than you in his regime that he has, you know, you're strong with me
[00:59:21] fine.
[00:59:22] And then I'm going to try to be more agile than you.
[00:59:24] You know, you're quicker than me.
[00:59:25] Okay, well, I'm going to maybe try to outpower you those type of things and those games
[00:59:28] that you play kind of back and forth.
[00:59:31] There is no question at the end of a flight at Top Gun that you're fighting another
[00:59:34] dude who won.
[00:59:35] Nobody comes back and I wonder how I did on that one.
[00:59:37] It's all very evident.
[00:59:38] If you're looking over your shoulder and the guy is telling to these gunning you with his
[00:59:42] airplane, you don't go back to the debrief and think, I wonder how that, I wonder how this
[00:59:45] is going to play out.
[00:59:47] So it's all right there, laid out the cards are always in the table.
[00:59:50] There's a reason for everything while you succeeded in while you failed.
[00:59:53] And I just thrived in that environment because you couldn't hide from anything.
[00:59:58] Everybody saw everything and it was all right there.
[01:00:00] Who good student, a really good talented student coming up to Top Gun has what percentage
[01:00:06] chance of winning.
[01:00:07] So if the best, let's say the high-peter to the best student that I ever saw that came to
[01:00:13] Top Gun as a student from a squadron, the best student that ever came to Top Gun to fight
[01:00:18] a qualified Top Gun instructor stands 0% chance of winning.
[01:00:23] The best student at Top Gun has zero chance.
[01:00:27] I could fall asleep in an airplane as an IP and a student is not going to be me.
[01:00:31] There is just such a huge, and it doesn't even mean that we're better.
[01:00:35] I don't mean to imply that we were better pilots, but you're just, you're a hat time.
[01:00:39] Yep, it's just time.
[01:00:40] And it's not even me that critical.
[01:00:44] It's just not even close.
[01:00:45] And nor would they expect it.
[01:00:47] Some students, every now and then a student thinks he's going to do some good work and I
[01:00:50] watch this, I'm awesome.
[01:00:52] But most guys show up realizing that disparity, I understood that when I got there as a student,
[01:00:57] these guys are just in a different world.
[01:00:58] You want to get to that world.
[01:01:00] But as an IP, if I instructor, if I flew my best jet on day one against the best
[01:01:09] student, it would be over so fast that he almost wouldn't even learn as much as he should.
[01:01:16] So you, you still fly your best airplane, but you make sure that there's a learning process.
[01:01:21] There, if you want to just annihilate somebody at Top Gun, as you can do that, the students
[01:01:26] that come there, even on their last day aren't on your same level.
[01:01:33] They just aren't.
[01:01:34] They've gotten a lot better than learning curve as steep.
[01:01:36] But when you're in your third year as an IP at Top Gun, you've just had so many reps,
[01:01:40] so many laps doing the exact same thing.
[01:01:42] You've seen everything that it's almost like, we talked about this yesterday, it's almost
[01:01:47] like things are happening in the slow motion for you.
[01:01:48] You're in the matrix and that guy is just working as hard as he possibly can and doing
[01:01:51] his thing.
[01:01:52] And you're just kind of sitting there, kind of watching it at like one third speed.
[01:01:56] So you're ability to decide and do something to him or do something to that airplane or make
[01:02:00] a decision.
[01:02:02] You're just operating in a faster pace than him.
[01:02:04] And that reaction is just impossible to keep up with.
[01:02:06] I can't wait to start training Jiu Jitsu because you're just going to the analogies or just
[01:02:11] everywhere.
[01:02:12] And that's one thing I said, Jiu Jitsu, you can see the future.
[01:02:15] You can actually see the future when you're training Jiu Jitsu with someone that doesn't
[01:02:18] know as much as you, you know what is going to happen.
[01:02:22] You know what they are going to do.
[01:02:24] Just like when you're in the cockpit and you do something and you know what that person
[01:02:27] you know what they're going to do.
[01:02:28] You just know it totally.
[01:02:30] And don't forget too as an instructor, you've been on the receiving end of that for years
[01:02:34] as well.
[01:02:35] You're standing kind of both sides of that coin and you know you fly with someone and
[01:02:39] you'll think you're so like, oh, I can't believe you just did that.
[01:02:42] And then you know three turns later is when you get to take advantage of that because
[01:02:46] you know some time we'll have to play out for his mistake to really reveal itself like
[01:02:50] man, I can't believe you just did that.
[01:02:52] This is going to cost you over time.
[01:02:54] And you can go back on the tape like I said and say, hey, you know, you're worried about
[01:02:58] what happened at the end, run behind you.
[01:03:00] But what really, what let me do that was 30 seconds ago you did this.
[01:03:05] And when this was the environment or the circumstances and you see that stuff and that's
[01:03:09] when you talk about seeing the future, I mean, if you really want to be a jerk about it,
[01:03:12] you know, if guys of your buddies, you know, I'll get in the radio like a buddy of mine.
[01:03:15] I'll, students that came through but guys in my squash and like, oh, that's going to hurt.
[01:03:18] And they're like, what am I, I'm like, stand by.
[01:03:21] You know, in 30 seconds later you'll be gone in the guy because you see the mistakes
[01:03:25] that they make and you know how that's going to play out.
[01:03:29] So you are on your own playing field there as an instructor and like I said, man, it's
[01:03:33] not about being better or worse.
[01:03:36] It's just the time and you get so much of the time there and you get exposed to all the
[01:03:41] the why you get the why at top gun.
[01:03:45] We teach the why a lot but when you're writing the manual, when you're doing that and you
[01:03:50] have all the testing equipment available and you're running a thousand computer generator
[01:03:55] reps to see what the results are, the level of what you know about the why is just so much
[01:04:00] more.
[01:04:01] You just, there's a whole world available to you to and and the guys at top can too want
[01:04:06] to be there.
[01:04:07] The most that IPs are killing to get to a place like that.
[01:04:10] So there's not a lot of slackers there.
[01:04:12] Not a lot of dudes are trying to motivate or kind of prod along like, hey, buddy, let's
[01:04:16] get go, you know, dudes are getting after it from startup to shut down every single day.
[01:04:20] And so you're also getting pulled along because you want to keep up with your peers.
[01:04:23] You know, you don't want to be the worst top gun instructor there.
[01:04:27] You know, every time you think you've made it, you realize all you did is just getting
[01:04:30] more selective pool and your goal is the same as to be the best that you can be and hopefully
[01:04:34] the best you can be is one of the best guys there.
[01:04:35] You know, you don't want to be last at top gun because then you're just last and when we
[01:04:39] last and anything who does and so that's a real kind of a type of a real aggressive
[01:04:43] group of dudes and they pull you and you you got to keep up and sometimes you know, a couple
[01:04:48] guys here and they're done for for the most part the selection process works pretty well.
[01:04:52] You know, what's cool just to bring this back for a second to, you know, talking about
[01:04:57] leadership and interacting with other people.
[01:04:59] The same exact thing happens when you start to pay attention to the tactics, techniques,
[01:05:06] procedures of leadership.
[01:05:09] You start to see the moves that people are making.
[01:05:12] You know, you start to see the moves that your subordinate is making because his ego is
[01:05:15] flaring up or because he's getting, taking too much ownership of something that he doesn't
[01:05:21] want to let go and he's getting emotional about it.
[01:05:22] You start seeing the same type of things at one third speed.
[01:05:29] You know, that was great for me when I was running the West Coast Seal Team training.
[01:05:34] That's all we take a platoon.
[01:05:35] We had these scenarios and we put up a tune through, we put another platoon through, we put
[01:05:41] another platoon through, we just over to the same scenario.
[01:05:44] Guy here, shoot her over here, person on this hilltop, hostage in this room.
[01:05:48] We put all these guys through the same scenario and so as soon as you approach, as soon
[01:05:52] as you watch him approach and you say, oh, the platoon commander's too far in the rear.
[01:05:56] So what's going to happen?
[01:05:59] He's not going to see what's coming up front up.
[01:05:59] Yep, there it is.
[01:06:00] And so you just know what's going to happen.
[01:06:01] And it's the same thing when you start dealing with their personalities.
[01:06:03] You get a guy with a big ego that comes in and he wants to run everything his way and he thinks
[01:06:06] he's going to be able to control everything and you're like, no, he's not going to be able
[01:06:08] to do this.
[01:06:09] So you can end up and I see that in the business world, obviously now too, where you get the
[01:06:13] same exact problems of a guy that's too emotional about his plan or has too big of an ego
[01:06:19] about something or he's not passing the word well enough for the, he's trying to control
[01:06:22] everyone and not using decentralized commitment.
[01:06:24] It's so obvious because you have the reps.
[01:06:28] We have the reps now in this arena to be to look at a situation and say, okay, let me
[01:06:35] watch this.
[01:06:36] Oh, oh, okay, I see what's about to happen.
[01:06:38] Here's what's going on.
[01:06:39] We can break it down.
[01:06:40] So it's the same thing across the board.
[01:06:41] You get that level of just experience and repetitions and repetitions.
[01:06:47] And now you can kind of see the future and you can predict what's going to happen.
[01:06:51] And then the good thing is in the business world, when you can predict what's going to happen,
[01:06:54] you can stop it.
[01:06:55] You can get the people on the right track, pull them back in and get them arranged.
[01:06:58] Well, I think the thing that a lot of people don't realize because sometimes they think
[01:07:02] it's just different in the military.
[01:07:04] The reasons why people are successful in the military and the reasons why people fail are
[01:07:09] exactly the same as why you succeed in business and why you succeed as a person or why
[01:07:13] you fail.
[01:07:14] Now look, I know, you know, being an airplane is different.
[01:07:16] I get that.
[01:07:17] The environment might be a little bit different being combat certainly.
[01:07:19] So the setting changes in all these things, the setting is different.
[01:07:22] But the reasons are exactly the same.
[01:07:25] And so to dispel whatever myth, you know, it's different in the military.
[01:07:28] It's identical in the military.
[01:07:29] No, no, no.
[01:07:30] It comes out in an airplane or it comes out on a ship or whatever it comes out in downtown
[01:07:34] Ramadhi.
[01:07:35] The setting?
[01:07:36] Yeah, it's different.
[01:07:38] But what's going on?
[01:07:39] It's identical.
[01:07:41] And when you get to, when you get to being a place where you get to devote 100% of your time
[01:07:45] to that and you're not distracted by just the distracts of military bureaucracy and life
[01:07:51] of training schedules and did everybody do their annual survey.
[01:07:56] When you're away from that and you're living in a world who's being tactical and doing nothing
[01:08:00] but learning about how to be the best part you can be in the best teacher.
[01:08:04] Everything, not just being a fighter about everything in the world slows down.
[01:08:08] Everything slows down.
[01:08:10] And I think it just gives you a perspective on life that, top God, I will carry those
[01:08:15] lessons.
[01:08:16] I mean, obviously, I care that with me and everything that I do and I will forever.
[01:08:20] You know, what was honed at a place like that and in some ways in the military, it's just
[01:08:24] a luxury because it's just not that common to have someone say for three years, you're
[01:08:27] just going to do nothing but this.
[01:08:29] What, dude?
[01:08:30] Are you kidding me?
[01:08:31] So, so speaking of decision making and good and or bad decision making.
[01:08:36] So you're living the dream, you're up in Fallon, you actually have a house up in the mountains,
[01:08:41] you're skiing, flying, everything's good.
[01:08:45] And then somehow you make a decision that's a little bit off the track a little bit.
[01:08:49] What was that all about?
[01:08:50] I don't know.
[01:08:51] I'm going to talk about it.
[01:08:53] So yeah, I am, I'm in my third year at Top Gun, 2005.
[01:08:57] I was selected be the training officer.
[01:08:58] So I am running Top Gun as the senior IP there, which is just, it's awesome.
[01:09:05] It's a, it is literally, as a Marine, it's a dream job.
[01:09:08] You could not ask for anything better.
[01:09:10] I was dating what ended becoming my wife.
[01:09:14] So my wife Whitney at the time we're dating, so it lives out there.
[01:09:17] We had a place in Tahoe, drove a Corvette, my life was pretty good, man.
[01:09:22] And I'm actually coming up on my end of service obligation.
[01:09:26] I can leave the Marine Corps in 2005.
[01:09:28] And I sort of sold my relationship to Whitney on that idea.
[01:09:33] Like, hey, come put up with this, live in a Tahoe, but I'm going to get out of the Marine
[01:09:37] Corps and don't worry about this.
[01:09:38] None of this is all, it's all come, don't worry about that.
[01:09:41] Defondments war, it's over.
[01:09:42] You don't need to worry about that.
[01:09:44] So I think I oversold that to her a little bit, got her to move out to Tahoe.
[01:09:50] And so there was just a part of me that didn't feel done with the Marine Corps.
[01:09:57] And ironically, in this amazing experience that I had built up in my mind since I was 16 years
[01:10:03] old, I'm now a Top Gun instructor.
[01:10:05] I joined the Marine Corps knowing, as a fortunately, Top Gun was this big influence.
[01:10:10] I'm going to leave the Marine Corps as a Top Gun instructor.
[01:10:11] But I had spent four years flying F-18s off carriers, basically in the Navy for the
[01:10:19] Frol and Tenset purposes.
[01:10:20] And I was a Marine in the Marine Squadron, but we deployed with Navy carriers.
[01:10:22] And I spent three years in Fallon on a Navy base with a Navy command.
[01:10:27] It was one of three pilots on the Staff at Top Gun.
[01:10:32] And there was just a part of me that I knew I was going to be done.
[01:10:35] I was ready to leave the Marine Corps, but I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having
[01:10:38] fulfilled.
[01:10:39] That part of being a Marine, a real Marine, is kind of how I felt.
[01:10:44] And so, again, I had kind of contemplated what I was going to do.
[01:10:51] You talked to somebody called your monitor.
[01:10:52] He's the guy that gives you orders.
[01:10:53] Hey, this is what's next in your career.
[01:10:54] This is where you're going to go for how long we think you should do this because it's
[01:10:58] helpful for whatever.
[01:10:59] The kind of explains it to you as a guy that basically is responsible for your career progression.
[01:11:03] And I was kind of going back and forth with what do I do?
[01:11:05] Do I stay into I get out?
[01:11:06] And I kind of was struggling with that decision.
[01:11:10] And he's like, look, we're going to, as a top instructor, you've got a lot of skill,
[01:11:13] we've got a lot of experience, and then want you to use that and bring it back to the
[01:11:17] Marine Corps and go to a squadron and teach these guys.
[01:11:20] So, he gave me orders.
[01:11:22] It says your order is going to be to go into Japan.
[01:11:24] You're going to fly a f-a-tines back to the regular fleet squadron and you'll go from there.
[01:11:29] And I even, I think I even got the point right out, orders given to me.
[01:11:32] Would you be in like a squadron commander?
[01:11:33] Or else?
[01:11:34] No, I would have been.
[01:11:35] The officer of Maine, it's officer.
[01:11:36] I was too junior.
[01:11:37] I'd only been in, I was like 10 years old.
[01:11:39] You know, 11 years more.
[01:11:40] So, I'm kind of what's called, we call it a department head, where I'm going to run a major
[01:11:43] department in the squadron.
[01:11:44] It was operations or Maine.
[01:11:45] It took kind of the two big ones.
[01:11:48] And I just didn't, it's not what I wanted to do.
[01:11:54] I had, like I said, some long-term plans to do another stuff.
[01:11:56] I was thinking, long-term I was going to get out and go do something else.
[01:11:59] And so, I called them on her.
[01:12:01] I said, hey, I want to do a factor.
[01:12:04] A factor is that four-dark controllers, like you described earlier on the podcast.
[01:12:08] And we had this little list on the internet that was called a hot fill list.
[01:12:11] It was basically all the jobs that nobody wanted.
[01:12:13] And if you called, it was a first come first serve.
[01:12:15] You called and volunteer for anything.
[01:12:16] You were automatically going to get it.
[01:12:18] And because it was just a list of jobs that they couldn't, like, force on guys or whatever
[01:12:21] reason I'm trying not to explain it all that well.
[01:12:22] But the bottom line is the hot fill bill it is.
[01:12:25] You call it yours for any reason.
[01:12:27] And I'm like, hey, man, I see this a hot fill to be a four-dark controller in Japan.
[01:12:31] Because I was going to go to Japan, we kind of cross that bridge of, okay, we're going to move overseas.
[01:12:35] We didn't have any kids.
[01:12:36] This is with Whitney.
[01:12:37] This is with Whitney.
[01:12:38] She's a little bit not super cool with it, but we found it will go to Japan.
[01:12:41] We'll fly.
[01:12:42] It'll be fine.
[01:12:43] And he's like, you're not going to be a four-dark controller in Japan.
[01:12:47] You're going to go fly and when I said dude, it's right there in black and white man.
[01:12:50] It says hot fill.
[01:12:51] I'm your guy.
[01:12:53] And he was like, okay, yeah, I mean, he and so he gave me these orders.
[01:12:56] And I wanted to be a factor.
[01:13:00] Because I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having fulfilled all the parts about being a Marine.
[01:13:04] And in my mind, it's funny because it's like we're opposite on that.
[01:13:07] The real challenge or the thing I didn't really want to do, but I knew I should was getting
[01:13:11] out of the airplane and doing something really hard in the ground.
[01:13:14] Like, my natural state in the Marine Corps is in an airplane.
[01:13:19] And for some people, they're miserable and I don't want to do it for me.
[01:13:21] That was, so to do that was to be a four-dark controller was.
[01:13:25] And it's strange to hear myself say it.
[01:13:27] I didn't want to go be a four-dark controller, but I knew I needed to go do that.
[01:13:31] There's no, I needed to leave the Marine Corps and say, yeah, I did that too.
[01:13:36] And it was just a matter of a fulfillment of kind of an exclamation point on the career that
[01:13:40] I always kind of fantasize him as I learned more about the Marine Corps.
[01:13:42] There was more to it than just being a pilot.
[01:13:44] Right.
[01:13:45] So, so in your mind, were you thinking four-dark controller in Japan, met you're going to go
[01:13:49] over there, you know, have a little team of Marines.
[01:13:51] You'd go out to the different training ranges, call for some bombs, all good.
[01:13:56] You know, go home at night, be with your wife.
[01:13:58] Might even go.
[01:13:59] Just in Japan.
[01:14:00] Just in just nice little, sort of like a long vacation, working a little bit of time
[01:14:04] on the ground.
[01:14:05] I get to go to the field.
[01:14:06] I spend the night in the woods.
[01:14:07] Yeah, something like that.
[01:14:08] You know, yeah.
[01:14:09] It's really cool camping.
[01:14:10] And they pay for it.
[01:14:11] Yeah.
[01:14:12] So, yeah, that's what it was.
[01:14:13] I was going to go to Japan.
[01:14:14] There's a bunch of really cool, it was going to be in Okinawa actually.
[01:14:16] So, not mainland Japan.
[01:14:17] Okinawa's got great scuba diving.
[01:14:19] It's kind of neat.
[01:14:20] And, you know, I could bring my wife with me.
[01:14:22] It was going to be a lot of fun.
[01:14:24] And I was going to teach guys how to use airplanes or drop bombs.
[01:14:28] I knew how to do that.
[01:14:29] I was going to be a really cool thing.
[01:14:31] So, I get these orders.
[01:14:32] And my wife and I moved out to Japan.
[01:14:35] We got there.
[01:14:36] And to Okinawa, I placed called Camp Pants in a little base up there in the middle of the island.
[01:14:40] And I'm there probably.
[01:14:45] Dude, I'm probably there a week.
[01:14:47] And my boss, the brigade, the two commander, is like, hey, we're going to send a brigade
[01:14:52] of platoon, which is probably 50 guys.
[01:14:54] I'm guessing at the numbers.
[01:14:56] To Camp Pants Jun.
[01:14:57] Because that angle just came back from seven months in Iraq.
[01:15:01] And they need to go right back and turn to very quick turn around.
[01:15:03] They don't have enough qualified guys.
[01:15:06] And so, I mean, I'm there a week and I'm coming home to tell Whitney like, hey, here's
[01:15:10] the deal.
[01:15:12] They need guys to go out to the Jun to do this deployment to Iraq.
[01:15:15] And I'm going to be one of those guys.
[01:15:17] So we were there instead of a year we were there for maybe.
[01:15:20] She was like, is there snorkeling in Iraq?
[01:15:23] Because you were telling me about scuba diving.
[01:15:27] So we crammed a year's worth of stuff in about six weeks.
[01:15:31] Because we had, so it was probably maybe early November when we kind of came down.
[01:15:36] And we had to the end of the counter year.
[01:15:38] So we shoved a year's worth of living in Japan in about six weeks.
[01:15:43] And we did Korea, we did Thailand, we did mainland, Tokyo, we did got her dog call.
[01:15:47] I mean, we did it all only December 22nd or whatever it was, you know, we flew home.
[01:15:53] And I went straight to the Jun from there to start training with second Anglico, which was the
[01:15:59] team that had just come back from Iraq after there's seven months appointment.
[01:16:01] And I'm on a very quick turn.
[01:16:03] They're probably four months into their turn on.
[01:16:04] So you get just real quick for people that don't know what Anglico is.
[01:16:07] Yeah, please.
[01:16:09] The Anglico stands for Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.
[01:16:14] And really what it is, it's a group of small teams, four or five man teams called Fire
[01:16:20] Power Control teams.
[01:16:21] And what those teams were all supposed to be able to do is control airplanes, tell airplanes
[01:16:26] what to do with their bombs.
[01:16:28] We could control artillery, so how to fire artillery ordinance.
[01:16:31] And even we didn't do it there on Iraq, but we could use Naval Gunfire.
[01:16:35] So guns off ships, we were training all three of those skill sets.
[01:16:38] And the whole point of an Anglico and a place like Iraq is you had different units, you
[01:16:43] had Navy units, Army units, Marine Corps units, and as an Anglico, you're really a zone.
[01:16:47] So that's what the L and Anglico is.
[01:16:48] So I was trying to go to an Army unit and know how Army does people may not know this.
[01:16:54] All the surface is actually do the same job differently.
[01:16:56] So the Army and the Marine Corps will get the same mission and have a totally different way
[01:16:59] of doing it because their doctrine they're training is different.
[01:17:01] Now it's similar, but there's a bunch of pretty critical differences in there.
[01:17:05] And so what we were training to do is we had all marine airplanes in where we were on Iraq
[01:17:09] and all Army land forces.
[01:17:11] So the Army doesn't have any training, how to use Marine Corps airplanes.
[01:17:14] Marine Corps does have a lot of training to use Army ground forces.
[01:17:17] So when those two people connect, there's a problem with how they communicate and what they
[01:17:21] want from each other.
[01:17:22] Insert Anglico, where the liaison between the Army ground units and in this case the Marine
[01:17:27] Corps air units.
[01:17:28] So my job was to control Marine airplanes to support the Army on the ground.
[01:17:32] And that was all over Iraq and what the Anglico team would take this whole group and break
[01:17:37] it into maybe 25 four-man teams and went all over the country to go do this same mission
[01:17:43] with a whole bunch of different units.
[01:17:45] So that was our mission as a four-dayer controller.
[01:17:47] And I was qualified as a four-dayer controller because I had flown airplanes, job bombs
[01:17:51] and combat understood how F-A teams were supposed to support ground maneuver and I went
[01:17:54] to school with four-dayer controller school.
[01:17:56] So let's go to Japan.
[01:17:57] It'll be fun for pretend to do that for a year.
[01:18:00] And then we had up in Camp Lajoon training to go to Iraq.
[01:18:06] And now it's your first time doing grunt work.
[01:18:10] So last time I had a held a rifle, shot a rifle, and worn a pair of combat boots was
[01:18:17] the basic school.
[01:18:19] So I had, you know, I got my air slotted at TBS.
[01:18:23] That was a big day for me.
[01:18:25] You know, I had done six months of that.
[01:18:26] I had that check in the block.
[01:18:27] I was feeling pretty good about that.
[01:18:29] And I had never, I don't think I put on my camey, my camey-mathalized uniform.
[01:18:33] I think I wore a flight suit.
[01:18:35] Honestly, I think every day for seven years.
[01:18:38] I could probably count on one hand.
[01:18:40] Well, even longer than that, I was even counting flight school.
[01:18:41] I could probably count on one hand the number of days that I didn't wear a flight
[01:18:46] suit from the time that I selected to go to flight school to the time that I ended up in
[01:18:50] Anglico.
[01:18:51] Days.
[01:18:52] I mean, so this was a foreign.
[01:18:54] Now, I had, I was in Marine.
[01:18:57] I went through the basic schools all back there somewhere.
[01:19:01] But I think there is this, and I've mentioned this, I think, to you, I think it's just
[01:19:06] sort of this habit of self-sabotage.
[01:19:08] Like, well, I can't leave the Marine Corps that being a real Marine.
[01:19:12] So I'm going to literally sabotage myself by volunteering for a job that I don't know if
[01:19:15] I really want to do, but now I'm stuck doing it.
[01:19:18] So I'm going to have to do that.
[01:19:19] So I won't ever have to say, I didn't do that.
[01:19:22] So this kind of cycle of breaking promises to my wife volunteering for stuff.
[01:19:27] I didn't really want to do but knew that I should.
[01:19:29] And next thing I know, it all blew up in my face because I was going to Japan.
[01:19:33] That Japan's awesome.
[01:19:34] Good sushi and great experience there and it's going to be awesome and I will be a
[01:19:38] fact and I can, for the rest of my life, say, oh, I was a rumor.
[01:19:40] I was a fact and I did all that.
[01:19:43] And, you know, it's January and campus.
[01:19:45] It's really what it is for.
[01:19:46] Yeah, it's for.
[01:19:47] Holy man.
[01:19:48] So, yeah, make no mistake.
[01:19:50] I mean, I did that, I volunteered, but I did not at the time when I was trading in my flying
[01:19:56] orders for these fact orders.
[01:19:57] I didn't expect to be in a body.
[01:20:01] But as, hey, we need to send an uppercatable tune to campus unit prep those guys to
[01:20:06] course.
[01:20:07] Yep, I'm going.
[01:20:08] I'm not going to not go.
[01:20:09] That's what we need to do.
[01:20:10] We're going to go do that.
[01:20:11] When I got to campus unit, I ended up being the senior, just by rank, the senior
[01:20:15] four-year control room in the unit.
[01:20:17] I was kind of a middle-level major, I, you know, come from top going.
[01:20:21] I came straight from top going to that and I was an experienced guy in the community
[01:20:23] officer, no joke.
[01:20:24] I picked her the day, walks in one day and he hands me a piece of paper and it's got like
[01:20:28] 26 lines on it, one for every team.
[01:20:31] And on the other sheet was all the locations that we were going to go to.
[01:20:35] And he's like fill out, we're all the teams are going because we got to cover these
[01:20:38] 15 different locations, you know, one to two teams per location and just write the number
[01:20:42] of the team on there and get this back and move up close to business.
[01:20:44] Like Roger, that's her.
[01:20:45] I think her.
[01:20:47] And again, my wife loves the story and I didn't tell her at the time, but my best friend
[01:20:53] who I grew up with was in Ramadi at the time.
[01:20:55] He was in third-time, seventh-marine, so we replaced when we got out there or did a turnover
[01:21:00] with.
[01:21:02] And that's where the war was, man.
[01:21:04] I mean, in late 2005 and in early 2006, the war was in Ramadi.
[01:21:09] And so I took the then, I wrote Lightning 6 and so 6162 and 6-3, we're all going
[01:21:14] in Ramadi and I handed it off to every field of that, gave it to the CO.
[01:21:17] So if you're going to go do something you don't necessarily want to do, but you're going
[01:21:24] to go do it, you might as well do it.
[01:21:25] And that's where the war was.
[01:21:27] I could have gone to a whole host of other places where there's not much going on, it
[01:21:30] would have been relatively chill.
[01:21:32] I would have gotten that check in the block for sure.
[01:21:34] I would have said, yeah, I went to a hero there and no hit on the guys in a different
[01:21:39] place is just more going on there.
[01:21:42] And if I wasn't going to go, then somebody else is going to go do that.
[01:21:44] So it was Neil Neil was telling you what was up he said, hey, it's on.
[01:21:47] Big time.
[01:21:48] No, he and I were tight and we talked as regular as we could as much as we can say.
[01:21:51] Oh, you're listening to you telling you like, oh, yeah, I was putting rounds on shooting
[01:21:54] yesterday and you said, well, what were you shooting at?
[01:21:56] And he's like, people.
[01:21:58] Yeah, I was just, it was such a foreign thing to me as a pilot, certainly coming from
[01:22:02] top.
[01:22:03] And this is my best friend too.
[01:22:04] And our whole life, we both wanted to be in Ramadi.
[01:22:06] We never, we were in the same unit together.
[01:22:08] We just couldn't get aligned with that.
[01:22:10] It never occurred to me when we were kids dreaming about being in Ramadi or Firepotset.
[01:22:13] The only time we'd ever served together was in Ramadi as Fort Controlers.
[01:22:17] I healed with some of this podcast.
[01:22:19] He'll get a good chuckle out of this.
[01:22:20] But so he was there for the seven months prior.
[01:22:22] So I think the, you know, maybe June or July of that year when I was getting ready to get
[01:22:27] orders, he was on his factory.
[01:22:30] And he was just a baton, a baton, a baton, three seven.
[01:22:32] You know, OP293 OP, he would be here with you guys.
[01:22:34] It's just doing the deed man.
[01:22:36] I'm getting out of big time and struggling, this a lot going on there.
[01:22:41] And when he would tell me this story is even someone who had been a Marine for that long,
[01:22:46] he's like, yeah, we're in a firefight.
[01:22:47] I'm like, are you shooting your rifle?
[01:22:49] Is that yeah, man?
[01:22:50] I get what?
[01:22:51] The people that are shooting in me, it's just, it's, it's, it's, you're disconnected.
[01:22:55] And you have this, you don't have this sense of what that means.
[01:22:58] And so even as I was processing what he was saying and trying to understand and then
[01:23:02] saying, I, this is where the, this is what I'm going to go do and kind of volunteering
[01:23:06] to go do that.
[01:23:07] I'll be honest with you.
[01:23:08] I mean, there's still a part in retrospect that just didn't really quite fully grasp
[01:23:12] what that meant.
[01:23:13] I don't know how anybody on the first deployment to a place like a Romadi goes
[01:23:17] into that.
[01:23:18] You know, I dabble to aviation, like you said, I'm up in the sky.
[01:23:21] I mean, it's relatively safe.
[01:23:23] And I'm sure even the first deployment you did, there's just, there's an element of
[01:23:26] just not being able to fully understand it.
[01:23:28] And that didn't even become clear to me until right when we're getting ready to leave
[01:23:32] from a body and the new units coming in and I was explaining what they're about to get
[01:23:35] into.
[01:23:36] They hit me and I just rewind myself a year earlier.
[01:23:39] I'm like, I'm that dude that really doesn't know what the hell's about to happen to
[01:23:42] him and what's about to go on.
[01:23:44] But it was like I said, man, I don't even want to make it sound like that big of a deal.
[01:23:50] But I've all in here for a fact to her.
[01:23:52] They need to guys to go to the gym to go to Iraq.
[01:23:54] That's where Romadi was where the fight was.
[01:23:56] My best friend was there.
[01:23:57] I'm going to Romadi.
[01:23:58] Yeah.
[01:23:59] And that was about it.
[01:24:00] It was just, that's where I thought I should do.
[01:24:00] So I went to Romadi.
[01:24:03] And now you're leading Marines too.
[01:24:04] Yeah.
[01:24:05] And yes, so I explained just a minute ago about those things that may be successful and
[01:24:14] things that lead to failure are identical.
[01:24:16] They are the exact same things in an airplane or the same on the ground.
[01:24:19] But the environment is different.
[01:24:23] It is different.
[01:24:24] There's no way around it.
[01:24:26] And I also would say too that and for good reason, I think the ground Marines, you know,
[01:24:30] I worked a lot of infantry in artillery.
[01:24:33] Most of Anglican was made up of artillery and cemetery, not, and you know, obviously there's
[01:24:36] pilots that are controllers.
[01:24:38] There's a decent bit of skepticism of pilots coming in to lead these teams.
[01:24:43] And I think for a good reason, you know, because a lot of these guys when I talk about
[01:24:47] combat experience, they're on their third fourth floor in the Iraq.
[01:24:50] Totally man.
[01:24:51] You're coming in.
[01:24:52] Yep.
[01:24:53] They're on their, they've already done.
[01:24:54] You're wearing your top gun patch on your shoulder of your can.
[01:24:57] Well, what's worse is I'm not wearing my top gun patch.
[01:25:00] I'm wearing my camis.
[01:25:01] And they're like, have you ever washed those camis?
[01:25:03] I'm like, as a matter of fact, I haven't.
[01:25:05] They're fresh, you know, brand new.
[01:25:08] And they're wearing their camis from, they did the march up to Baghdad.
[01:25:11] They went home for four months and psycha right back around and did OIF2.
[01:25:15] Guys, it did fullusion.
[01:25:16] They're back.
[01:25:17] And they're on the third deployment in three years.
[01:25:18] And they're legit deployments.
[01:25:20] And, you know, Dave Burke, Mr. Topkin, shows up, and was like, where's this brigade
[01:25:24] platoon?
[01:25:25] You know, where's my salt team?
[01:25:26] You know, and I think that skepticism of, for good reason, is who is the
[01:25:31] best guy?
[01:25:32] And that's a real, that was a real leadership challenge for me, is to apply those things
[01:25:36] that I knew were effective, but in an environment that I'm totally out of my comfort zone,
[01:25:41] man.
[01:25:42] I'm totally out of my comfort zone.
[01:25:43] And I have to apply a skill set of things that I just haven't, I haven't shot a rifle
[01:25:48] since 1994.
[01:25:50] I got to the basic school in October, 1994, the first thing you do is go to the rifle
[01:25:53] range.
[01:25:54] That's the last time my school is a trigger on a rifle was October of 1994.
[01:25:58] The here it is is, you know, January of 2006, prepping to go to Ramadi, and I got to
[01:26:02] sit in my M4.
[01:26:04] So they should be skeptical a little bit.
[01:26:07] And it was a challenge for me, a real leadership challenge of to be successful in a place
[01:26:12] that I'm not comfortable with.
[01:26:13] To be honest with you, if you told me I was going to lead a squadron in combat, I'd feel
[01:26:18] pretty comfortable doing that.
[01:26:20] I know it would be a challenge, it'd be hard, but I wouldn't feel like, I don't know
[01:26:24] about this, I would be all over it.
[01:26:25] I don't mean to say easy, but right in my wheelhouse, not true for that.
[01:26:30] So I worked hard to try to be successful in that, and you know, you got to get your Marines
[01:26:35] to buy off on your program, you know, because you're going to go down town with those
[01:26:39] guys, you know, and every relationship with anyone with those guys was different as you
[01:26:43] know, you know, and you got to build those relationships and demonstrate that, you know,
[01:26:47] this is going to work.
[01:26:49] And then, you know, just talk a little bit about, you know, people have heard about what
[01:26:53] you bruiser was doing over in Ramadi, and we'll get to how we interacted, but overall,
[01:26:59] all you guys doing, when you first got there, you just kind of jumped into it, we could
[01:27:04] feed as they say.
[01:27:06] We did, man.
[01:27:08] So I get there.
[01:27:10] I've got a salt team that stands for supporting arms liaison team.
[01:27:13] Really what it meant was three of those little four man teams, grouped together in a
[01:27:17] one 13-man team, because we had an additional corpsman, little medic with us.
[01:27:23] So I had three of those teams that I was responsible for, and I kind of knew what I expected
[01:27:29] was going to happen.
[01:27:30] I got there that I would be in what's called the talk, the tactical operations center,
[01:27:33] which was I kind of run things from the desk and farm out my teams and units to support
[01:27:39] the guys that needed our help.
[01:27:40] These army units are going to go to missions.
[01:27:42] They needed someone to help them control the air.
[01:27:44] I had those teams.
[01:27:45] I would give them those teams.
[01:27:46] Well, it took basically no time to get there and realize that the demand signal for our support
[01:27:53] was higher than we could have ever responded to.
[01:27:56] They needed 20 of our teams, not three.
[01:28:00] And so that idea that I would kind of be a COC guy, a talk guy, was over in the first day,
[01:28:06] because as I get there and we're going to turn over the other angle of team getting
[01:28:09] ready to leave, he's introducing me to all the people he's been working with.
[01:28:13] It's like 15 different teams.
[01:28:17] They're not running operations like three battalions.
[01:28:20] It's 40 squads.
[01:28:23] These guys are going out in 12, 13, and they all need you.
[01:28:27] And there's operations.
[01:28:28] I mean, just so everyone is there's 5,600 people in the 1, 180 or you showed up in the
[01:28:33] 2, 2, 2, 2, 6,000 people or whatever.
[01:28:36] And there's operations going on all over Ramadi, every single night, there's people patrol
[01:28:40] and there's people getting in fire fights, every single night, there's constant gun
[01:28:43] fire.
[01:28:44] And so there's no way with three teams you're going to cover all that.
[01:28:47] You can't do it.
[01:28:48] Yeah.
[01:28:49] And that was sort of the immediate awareness for me is not only was I not going to be able
[01:28:54] to support everything.
[01:28:56] I know how to prioritize and tell folks, hey, we can do this and not that.
[01:29:00] I can help you here or there.
[01:29:02] And so very quickly, it was a matter of how am I going to break down my team and support
[01:29:06] these guys.
[01:29:09] I did have an advantage that I was as an F-18 pilot, that was the primary aircraft, F-18's
[01:29:15] and herers of the primary aircraft that was doing the support.
[01:29:17] And I knew those airplanes really well.
[01:29:19] And I was able to very quickly when I saw what the army, hey, we're doing this patrol
[01:29:23] today.
[01:29:24] And we're going to take our humbys from the camp Ramadi to go to this location.
[01:29:28] And it would be really difficult just to get there, just navigating at night in your
[01:29:31] humbys on the night vision goggles and the roads can be kind of confusing and you know what
[01:29:35] it's like down there and some days you're operating in downtown Ramadi and it's straight
[01:29:39] up urban combat like just buildings.
[01:29:42] And five miles away you can be in a place we called it my Charlie one that it looks
[01:29:47] like a Vietnam.
[01:29:48] I mean it's the contrast if we're being so close together was so incredible how different
[01:29:53] those places were.
[01:29:54] And so every environment was different.
[01:29:56] I was able to understand how what airplanes could do well and not well in those environments.
[01:30:00] And so as they ask for support on my head, I can't really do that but what I can do is this.
[01:30:05] And maybe this would be more helpful for you.
[01:30:06] And I could very quickly build a relationship with the army which is really who you needed
[01:30:10] to be the best support for the Marines.
[01:30:13] They were going to get on board.
[01:30:14] We were good.
[01:30:15] We had a relationship.
[01:30:16] I wasn't worried about my Marines and us building our team.
[01:30:19] What I was worried about was us as a team being effective for the folks we were supporting.
[01:30:25] And showing that we could do good work for those guys.
[01:30:27] And we took a very different approach.
[01:30:29] I immediately broke our team into three separate teams, 6162 and 630.
[01:30:33] I actually sent the 613 team, a guy named Alan to another base, Blue Diamond.
[01:30:38] And you remember that base right across the river because there was a company base out of
[01:30:41] Blue Diamond that we're doing operations independently and they never had any angle
[01:30:45] to support.
[01:30:46] So I do, you got to go move, they literally moved there and lived with those guys and then
[01:30:50] my other team 6162 Adam.
[01:30:53] And I just, we took a whiteboard and all the requests for support.
[01:30:59] We just started plugging in our names in.
[01:31:00] And so it was just, I had five guys, he had 48 is on Humby at my own Humby.
[01:31:04] We had all the weapons, all the radios and just started to just go do operations.
[01:31:09] Two to eight would do everything for just a little vehicle patrol where they would just
[01:31:12] do a presence patrol.
[01:31:13] They're two Humby is driving around the city.
[01:31:14] We would just jump in on that and just bring a third truck, which was a ton of firepower
[01:31:17] and awareness.
[01:31:19] Sometimes we were just doing foot patrols and we would just go walk around and do moving
[01:31:22] to contact or do room clearing stuff like that.
[01:31:26] I found myself way, way out of my comfort zone very early.
[01:31:31] I think my second mission there was a raid where I was ended up clearing a room.
[01:31:39] I was in a stack of dudes clearing a room.
[01:31:43] Well I was trying to talk to airplanes overhead and it was just basically a manpower
[01:31:49] shortage.
[01:31:50] Yeah, we'd get in, you need to, you need to go, guys go clear the room and rush that.
[01:31:56] Now, in I was a senior mid-grade major.
[01:31:58] I was always kind of one of the senior guys, but I wasn't in charge of this.
[01:32:00] So I would be working for a first lieutenant, which was perfectly fine.
[01:32:03] It was his platoon.
[01:32:04] He was doing this mission.
[01:32:05] He knew what he was doing.
[01:32:06] I was there to support his best as I could.
[01:32:08] That image of like, y'all just get up on the roof and control there.
[01:32:10] It'll be awesome.
[01:32:11] You need me to blow up negative.
[01:32:13] I mean, it was, hey, get in line and start getting out here.
[01:32:17] Now, I think that I remember that second mission.
[01:32:20] We're with the two to eight and the lieutenant was, I think he was like, I think he worked
[01:32:23] at Home Depot.
[01:32:24] No joke.
[01:32:25] I mean, National Guard units.
[01:32:26] Yeah, National Guard units, these dudes were awesome.
[01:32:28] They'd been there for probably 10 or 11 months by the time I got there.
[01:32:31] They're maybe even longer.
[01:32:32] They've been there almost a year.
[01:32:33] Hardened dudes that had lost a lot of guys and sacrificed a ton, but I was learning everything
[01:32:39] I could from them because they were veterans and I was brand new.
[01:32:41] I was supposed to bring the great capability, but the reality was I was just soaking up from
[01:32:45] them as much as I could.
[01:32:47] And I'm, I'm clear in a room with this guy, you know.
[01:32:51] So, the phrase, what am I doing here?
[01:32:55] Went through my head a lot while I was there.
[01:32:59] And it was just kind of, remind you, was it type of place that the deal was is when you got
[01:33:03] there, it was just a bullet train and you just jumped on the train.
[01:33:08] You had to.
[01:33:09] You couldn't slow things down.
[01:33:10] You certainly couldn't ask those other guys, hey, can we dial it back a little bit
[01:33:13] we need to get up to speed?
[01:33:15] They were just doing their thing and if you were going to be anything other than a hindrance
[01:33:18] you need to get on board immediately.
[01:33:21] And so that's what we did as best we could.
[01:33:24] And I have a lot to thank for those guys at T2A because no matter how hard we tried those
[01:33:29] first couple of times we're just getting up to speed.
[01:33:31] We're not, you know, bringing our A game, we're trying to figure out what's going on around
[01:33:35] us and there's no doubt that without those guys, their leadership, their willingness
[01:33:39] to kind of bring us on board and get us up to speed.
[01:33:42] That played a big part.
[01:33:43] We got up to speed quickly, but they won.
[01:33:46] I'm sure, you know, we were struggling to tell us.
[01:33:47] It's just like we were talking about with flying and jiu-jitsu and fighting and everything
[01:33:51] else.
[01:33:52] You show up there and things are going.
[01:33:54] They're not slowed down a third.
[01:33:55] They're going five times faster and you're just seeing, you know, you're getting told
[01:33:59] to clear a room.
[01:34:00] That's the only thing in the world you can see is now this room and you're not aware of
[01:34:03] all this other stuff that's going on and it definitely takes some ops to get your, get
[01:34:07] your senses about you of what's happening.
[01:34:09] Yeah.
[01:34:10] And the ops were, there were so many different kinds of operations like I said, you
[01:34:13] need to go from doing just, you know, a three humvy presence patrol and downtown
[01:34:18] or body is not cool. It's not. It's just you're just waiting for something to go wrong,
[01:34:24] you know, whether it's getting lit up, you know, in a firefight, RPG's getting shot. I mean,
[01:34:27] you were literally just driving around waiting for somebody to do something to you, you
[01:34:31] know, these presence patrols.
[01:34:32] And then you go right from that to you get some intelligence that somebody needed to
[01:34:37] grab was in, you know, a house somewhere in a totally different environment and you'd be
[01:34:40] off doing a raid.
[01:34:42] We help stand up the QRF. You talked about that in the past.
[01:34:44] The quick reaction force where you literally just waited right outside the gate
[01:34:48] to the main base for somebody to call for help. Okay, something's gone wrong. It's here,
[01:34:53] come help us. And so we just started doing all these missions. And I, I just was on board
[01:35:00] with all of them. And they vary. They were very different from day to day. And you got
[01:35:04] to call for fire, too. Do you legit?
[01:35:06] We did. We, we between me, I did a lot and my teams, we, I controlled the release of every
[01:35:13] single piece of ordinance in the Marine Corps imagery, Marine Corps inventory. So every piece
[01:35:19] of ordinance that the, the air, the hornets and the carriers dropped and everything from
[01:35:23] the huge in the cobras and our, we called our teller as well. They had a, you know,
[01:35:28] a, a field of artillery battalion out there that we did controls from as I think, if I did
[01:35:33] myself. So, you know, that store, you know, you get to TBS. There's an old saying in the
[01:35:38] Marine Corps, we all subscribed to it. Every Marine's a rifleman. And we are a top
[01:35:42] unit instructor that could not be further from the truth. Because the last thing you are
[01:35:47] as a top gun, as the training officer at Top Gun, skiing in Lake Tahoe on the Saturday afternoon
[01:35:52] is a rifleman. But I will, I will say this for the Marine Corps. Yeah, I'm biased. I'm a little
[01:35:57] proctor of the Marine Corps. Dude, it's all in there. The OCS, TBS, all that exposure, all
[01:36:03] that doctrine, everything that you learn, it's there. Now it took a while to dig down and
[01:36:06] find it. And those same things that when I went to OCS and I was a skiniest guy there and
[01:36:10] I was scared I couldn't get through it on my way to second. Bigger tougher, stronger
[01:36:14] dudes are doing this or not doing this and I am. It's all in there. And so I just had to
[01:36:19] figure out a tap that stuff again and bring it back up and just go do it. So, great decision.
[01:36:27] Nira, I am in Ramadi, get an after it. And then you guys showed up. Yeah, there was one story
[01:36:32] you were telling me that you were calling for fire up in MC1 and it was your buddy. Yeah.
[01:36:39] Yeah, we are doing what's called movement to contact my favorite mission as a pilot. Nothing
[01:36:45] better than movement to contact. And the movement to contact mission is you literally drive your
[01:36:49] humbys, take all your your folks out and you set up a staging area in the north side of this
[01:36:54] this big area is big, kind of wooded dirt has like little ravines and trees and stuff like that.
[01:36:59] And we would just we would walk up a troll. And you know, if 10 15 guys would just go from north
[01:37:05] to south and the mission was called movement to contact. So you walked until you got in contact.
[01:37:09] Which went you got into a firefight. And I remember not the same day but my first day going there.
[01:37:14] I think it was a Bravo Company at 2 to 8. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it was and I met
[01:37:18] the platoon commander for the first time. And I kind of get out of my humbys. I walk up and I'm looking
[01:37:22] for the platoon commander. I'm there as a supporting asset. I'm a helpful guy because I bring
[01:37:25] airplanes. It's going to be good for them. And he walks up and he's got a shotgun hanging on his
[01:37:30] kid. And you know I was a brand new guy but I was I'm like hey what's with the shotgun?
[01:37:36] You know I have a rifle. He was like hey the bounce with the I found that this is the best weapon
[01:37:41] for these type of missions. And it turns out he actually was right on that patrol. It's like
[01:37:47] dude what am I doing here man? You know I'm going to do a foot patrol with a guy with shotgun.
[01:37:52] So I knew that I was in there's a lot in store for that. And we would do these patrols
[01:37:58] these these movement contacts and you'd end up in a building. And my job as a fact was hey get out
[01:38:02] in the building get up on top of the roof right away and I would do Overwatch. You know similar
[01:38:07] different assets I had airplanes I had radios seals would do Overwatch all the time and there's
[01:38:11] just a matter of cover and moves. I would get up in the roof and I'd go hey this is what I see.
[01:38:14] This is what the airplane sees. Okay you guys jump to that next building. Sometimes the next building
[01:38:18] would be 20 yards away sometimes it would be 200 yards away. So you would you would just do these
[01:38:23] bounding movements building to building and then when they get to the next building my other guy would
[01:38:27] be up in the roof. It's a good way to run down and go to the next building.
[01:38:34] And so we get into this building and as soon as they get up on top of the roof of the building
[01:38:40] so if you can picture it half of us are in the roof of the building half of the other guys are
[01:38:44] trying to move to the other building so they're out in the open. And from that other building as I
[01:38:48] get up in the roof that I look up in the first one happens is like three RPGs hit the building
[01:38:53] that I'm in directly underneath me. Probably my team by like 15 feet below us so above their heads
[01:38:59] and below us that's the first thing that happens and there was a vehicle like a truck and I was a
[01:39:04] car was like just some car in between on a look kind of a dirt road behind some trees where this
[01:39:10] fire came from and we had airplanes overhead. There was two F-18 D's I remember from an East Coast
[01:39:16] squadron and you know a TBS they teach you hey everyone Marines arrive on man and they say
[01:39:21] they tell you these stories is that one day you're going to be in a position where you're going to
[01:39:27] be in a firefight and there's going to be an airplane overhead and it's going to be a buddy
[01:39:30] of yours from TBS going to be your old buddy and you're going to be like hey Jaco it's day to
[01:39:34] help me out and Dave's going to roll in on his white horse and come over this hornet and blast
[01:39:38] these things out and your infantry buddy is going to thank you one day. I'm going to write on.
[01:39:43] The only problem was that I was on the ground and the guy I find the airplane was one of my closest
[01:39:49] friends again and Boo Frieden was an opso of the squash and I just left and no joke I'm like
[01:39:57] hey we're in a troops in contact you know we're taking fire from wherever and on the radio
[01:40:02] he says hey chip it's Boo what do you need and it took me to wrap back to TBS on the problem was I was supposed
[01:40:07] to be in an airplane when that happened and I'm like I said I said South to North call wings level
[01:40:15] and that's what happened and I got four passes from these FATs did these strafing runs on this car
[01:40:21] and I remember looking at the army guys with his first lieutenant and I looked at him I go
[01:40:26] you're going to be fine like super cool like very chill hey this just happened I see what's going on
[01:40:31] there's hornets over head out I saw everything what do you need I need this we're in and you
[01:40:36] the X call is wings level hey you're cleared hot and you know the hair and arms stand up
[01:40:41] telling us sorry just one of those stories where the Marine Corps for whatever insane reason
[01:40:47] will take FATs and train them millions of dollars and ten years of training them and they'll stick
[01:40:51] them on the ground and it's for that exact reason that that exact event was I could bring an asset
[01:40:58] that the army would never have an environment that they would never be able to use and through
[01:41:03] two buddies just talking pointing was to each other on the radio make it happen in like that and
[01:41:12] I was supposed to be in that airplane jacco that's how it was supposed to work out but in that
[01:41:16] particular day of man it was the roles of reverse but it was it was an awesome it was kind of a
[01:41:20] culmination of a lot of things like that the Marine Corps it's a legit that thing they'd read
[01:41:24] nuts it's a real thing and it was pretty satisfying to be awesome you see that carburetor in the ground
[01:41:29] and then eventually yeah I don't know maybe a month or so goes by and we show up and who's the
[01:41:36] first who do you meet first life yep life was the first guy that I met actually life in Tony
[01:41:44] all right show up together um so we had seen you guys you know we had turned over and we were just
[01:41:51] kind of getting up to speed we probably been there maybe a month or so before you guys had so you
[01:41:55] know quick learning curve we're just kind of getting comfortable with what's going on we also
[01:41:59] know there's a new brigade of platoon coming in I'm sorry a new um uh uh armor division coming in
[01:42:05] the we know that the unit that we're there the two to eight that brigade combat team is leaving
[01:42:09] we knew new brigade combat team is coming in and we were actually in just a relative a short
[01:42:14] period of time we were kind of the continuity because all the old guys are leaving we had we had the
[01:42:17] overlap so we had a kind of a prominent role with a new battalion and the new battalion commander
[01:42:21] he's retired now um awesome dude from uh one three seven armor guy named Tedesco just
[01:42:28] an awesome dude just an awesome dude awesome um he would have been there as part of his
[01:42:33] turnover it had come out a couple months prior maybe a month prior and saw us and we had my favorite
[01:42:37] thing about Tedesco is like he said awesome guy we we were getting ready to do a big operation
[01:42:44] with them I think it was the first time we were pushing the south center of our body and we were in his
[01:42:48] briefing and he's quoting pat but he's quoting pat in the movie he's just kidding yeah I was like
[01:42:55] yes yes thank you thank you for bringing me here this day he was awesome and he had seen me
[01:43:01] he just so happened when he was doing his initial turnover before the the the battalion came out
[01:43:06] I had done I had controlled uh um a release I controlled a hellfire and blew up a car and he got
[01:43:14] to see it and it was kind of a cool thing is he comes and he's like who you know who these guys
[01:43:17] uh I'm in the middle of doing a real control happening being the COC that day
[01:43:21] blew up a car it's all in the video get this big TV screens to show the whole thing this card
[01:43:25] detonates and cool pictures and everything and he he comes over to me after we're done I'm kind of
[01:43:30] sitting there and he said Lieutenant Colonel and the major in the hicer he's like can you do that
[01:43:33] when we get here my absolutely man he's like we're gonna get along great that was my
[01:43:38] initial inter-inter-actual with him so it was awesome and so we knew when they were coming back we
[01:43:42] had already just to virtually that experience built some pretty good inroads of them and we
[01:43:46] are gonna do some good work he was also the type of guy look there's this is a whole brigade
[01:43:51] combat team came in that's 5000 guys but his battalion that group of you know several hundred
[01:43:55] was really the core group that I initially did most of my work with and his approach was if you
[01:44:00] can help us you're on the team they're um same exact attitude he had with us yeah for sure for
[01:44:06] all the enablers so uh they were called the bandits and they had a little bandit pin kind of a
[01:44:10] skull and crosspone's kind of thing you were if you you were I was a bandit teacher just totally
[01:44:16] onboard the team and he treated us like his own guys and that was awesome and so um all the enablers
[01:44:23] we had military we had working dogs we had explosive ordinance disposal we had the angle go
[01:44:27] folks we had the seals in all these different groups from different places that none of them were
[01:44:31] assigned to him but his approach was if you can help my soldiers out you're on your bandit you're on
[01:44:36] the team and everybody's like right on let's do this because that's you need to work with them
[01:44:40] anyway I'm as well make the best of it we started to do a couple of missions and everyone of
[01:44:46] those missions was your teams and my teams uh and I would say probably in the first week or so you
[01:44:51] know I'm guessing a little bit of dates but relatively quick in the first couple of missions
[01:44:55] we are doing the similar things we were bringing support and Overwatch and helping these guys
[01:45:00] through their job which is the exact same thing you guys were doing you know totally different
[01:45:03] ways but ultimately we were supporting these guys I meant my my little building there or one day
[01:45:09] whatever just sitting around prepping for something and in walks lay in Tony you know they
[01:45:14] they drove over from your base which is kind of you know a little bit of a haul around around
[01:45:18] their job and it goes hey man um love to work as you more we find a way that we can work together
[01:45:24] in some of these missions and we got this big mission coming up you want to come down and
[01:45:28] and breathe with us oh yeah absolutely I'd love to go breathe with the seals and be awesome
[01:45:34] thought it would just be the kind of cool one time thing I could see how seals do the business um and
[01:45:39] that was it that was his introduction had lathe and Tony I'll be really candid I'd like to think
[01:45:43] I would have done that I doubt I would have gone to shark base and knocked on your door and said hey
[01:45:48] lathe jacca let's do some work together he made that initial contact and him and Tony were
[01:45:53] definitely equal opportunity employers exactly and we the same thing as you know Colonel Tadesco
[01:45:58] if we thought someone could do something to help us out or we could complement each other in any
[01:46:02] way man we were knocking on doors to to try and make that happen for sure yeah and that was his
[01:46:07] approach um I didn't I'd never done any work on the ground I didn't know much about the seals
[01:46:12] I'll be very blunt I had my own opinion of what I assumed you guys would be like and it was
[01:46:19] probably something out of the movies expected like long beards and do's just running around doing
[01:46:23] their own thing uh and so I was actually a little surprised that that lathe came and asked to do
[01:46:28] some work with us and so I I went to that first night mission uh that first brief I don't want
[01:46:33] to say I was skeptical but I was certainly interested in what because my fear was that you guys
[01:46:38] are going to go do your own thing and my guys are kind of just either not be able to keep up
[01:46:42] not know what you're doing and not fit in very well and be able to help out and just kind of put
[01:46:45] ourselves at risk and and look I'll I'll say this very bluntly I have a very high bar when you
[01:46:53] leave Top Gunna what to expect from a mission brief and mission execution a mission debrief because that's
[01:46:58] what we're all about and I was pretty sure that there's no chance that you're going to do anything
[01:47:02] anywhere near that and I was shocked and kind of overwhelmed at how professional your
[01:47:11] organ at your team was and that was the biggest thing for me was what are these guys going to be like
[01:47:15] I just sort of picture day kind of a pickup game hit us go there and just you know kill some
[01:47:19] bad guys and come on back and high five each other and dude it was one of the most professional
[01:47:23] organized mission briefs I totally understood what your plan was I knew exactly what I was going to fit in
[01:47:28] we went and did it and then you guys debriefed after we came back after this it was a relative
[01:47:32] on event nothing really happened that night in terms of in the grand scheme of things that we saw
[01:47:36] over there and then you debriefed it you guys came back and you mission debriefed user there
[01:47:41] kind of clean a weapons and going through and analyzing what happened and that was it man I was totally
[01:47:47] on board I was I was I was I was sold that we could work together like pretty effectively
[01:47:52] and that was kind of the beginning it just sort of started out of the blue and you guys
[01:47:56] came down and asked to do some good work and we did a lot of work you're team did a lot of work with us
[01:48:03] because we we started to think because for our from our perspective and I know there's one
[01:48:08] junior officer out there who's now probably a lieutenant commander or maybe even a commander at this
[01:48:12] point but at that time you know he was on his first deployment and he was a jaytah what we call
[01:48:17] in the seal teams are air controllers are called a jaytah and so here he is and some of those
[01:48:22] missions instead of being a seal he's being a jaytah so he's one of those guys that looked over it
[01:48:28] you guys and said hey wait a second can you take this radio for me and do that thing so I can go
[01:48:32] do my frogman stuff over here and that at and plus again to be blunt you guys could do it a lot
[01:48:40] better than we could period you know we you know you were an F-18 pilot for crying out loud
[01:48:45] and we had a new guy junior officer on the radio trying to call for five you guys are just
[01:48:49] imminently better qualified to do it and so yeah we looked at it as if okay we that gives us one
[01:48:56] more shooter and it gives us a whole new level of expertise now of course there's jaytah
[01:49:01] and the seal teams that they are a lot more experience and they are awesome and of course but in our
[01:49:06] group you to bring you guys was just a huge level up for us to get a lot better and give us more
[01:49:12] people to maneuver as seals on assaults or on Overwatch or whatever so it turned out to be a
[01:49:19] real good little little relationship that I got going there it was a classic win win when when a
[01:49:25] seal says hey would you control the air so I can go shoot people you know and that means I'm no I don't
[01:49:32] have to clear that room and being a position where I might have to do something like that I'm all over
[01:49:36] and I yeah I know you're talking about we had a he and I had a great relationship someone that I
[01:49:40] really loved working with who wanted to go be a frogman like you said I wanted to go control
[01:49:46] their plants and we found a way to make that stuff work now it was it was a big deal for me though
[01:49:54] man to to for me and my guys to work with you guys because you've said this on the podcast and I know
[01:50:02] I know how organizations can we're not necessarily perocule that we don't trust other people
[01:50:07] but we get really comfortable how we do business and to just bring in another group of dudes I think
[01:50:12] this also speaks volumes to the desk and all those guys you're gonna just you want to make sure
[01:50:17] those guys can keep up you know and everybody knows that you guys are legit man and to keep up you
[01:50:23] got you're not to keep up you're not to carry your own weight and you're gonna have to make it happen
[01:50:26] you're gonna have to provide something because the minute you become a drain on the on the team
[01:50:31] you know you're gonna get cut loose and we we couldn't afford to be a drain on you and we couldn't
[01:50:36] afford to have other people be a drain on us so I think there's a lot of kind of at the beginning of
[01:50:41] there's there are a lot of reasons why it wouldn't have worked there's a whole bunch of reasons why it wouldn't have
[01:50:45] worked and the only reason it did work is that everybody was committed to building a relationship to support
[01:50:50] the battalion that was it we all have the same end state in mind it wasn't about what can the seals do to be
[01:50:55] seals and be great that you know what can we do to support those guys yeah well this is a whole thing I was
[01:50:58] opening up with that's sort of where that came from it's just this attitude that everybody there was on the same
[01:51:04] team straight up on the same team and so then that turned into big missions you know big missions
[01:51:10] pushing into Ramadi putting in the combat outpost you know night after night after night
[01:51:16] day after day doing those those big operations and that relationship just got just got stronger and stronger
[01:51:23] you know lay obviously with you and and just turned into something really
[01:51:30] we not just not just cool but man effective yeah effective it was I mean in that deployment I
[01:51:40] kept along journal like I took a lot of notes on my experience there and I've gone back and
[01:51:45] we read it a few times and I've somewhat recently throughout that whole thing one of the common
[01:51:50] themes is how the the lathe and I did this today are we did stuff with you all the time and it
[01:51:59] kind of became in that middle that kind of June July August I mean that was all we were really doing
[01:52:05] because we were so busy and the big up was kicking off and we were starting to get into downtown
[01:52:10] but you know you never been all these clearing all this stuff and so the need for us to support
[01:52:16] the army the need for you to support the army again we could have had ten times many of folks and
[01:52:20] we've probably still could have done more work um everything in that journal it's just about what we're
[01:52:26] doing together I think at the time I just kind of lost track of it because we were just every day
[01:52:30] get up and go do something I mean there's no down days there was hardly ever any time we weren't doing
[01:52:34] anything and it was almost always with you guys and it was a huge highlight for me to to to be with
[01:52:43] a group of guys that were so on board with just making things happen you guys had an incredible
[01:52:50] Mac of this is in the way or this process keeps it yeah we got that sort of down hey I need to get air
[01:52:56] points uh that what yeah did to do this and this you had no no we get we get this sort of out so
[01:53:02] you guys had kind of had cornered the market on what do you need will make we'll get it will make it happen
[01:53:07] and for me to be able to get that asset sort of delivered that I could and you did all the work
[01:53:12] to get it but I can control the hell out of it right on man I didn't have do any of the work to
[01:53:16] explain why I needed this because you guys did all that work and you had a valid reason for it they
[01:53:21] were laughing at me if I said I wanted an AC 130 gunship like who are you I'm Dave Burke man and
[01:53:26] like negative lathe and jocca need an AC 130 gunship not every time you know obviously there's a
[01:53:31] thin asset but that thing should have over head and then you get the guy we were talking about
[01:53:34] like you want to control this I'm like yes I do I want to control this thing so there's a lot of
[01:53:39] mutual benefit there and I think we also proved is I think for the battalion and the brigade they
[01:53:44] figured out that we were really helpful in helping those guys accomplish what they wanted to accomplish
[01:53:48] and that was just I'm not putting very good words to it right now but as obviously real rewarding
[01:53:52] and it was a highlight of that deployment is our ability to work together through like I said
[01:53:58] there's a whole laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't have been able to do this a bunch you didn't
[01:54:01] work for me I didn't have rank you you're guy there's just a whole bunch institutional roadblocks
[01:54:06] that we could just stay in our own corners and our own thing and you and I could have never met
[01:54:09] and that wouldn't have really been all that uncommon you would have just been optimal
[01:54:15] it worked out man yeah a lot of awesome highlights all that deployment and obviously
[01:54:24] some of the worst days of our lives are over there June 20th
[01:54:30] talking about that yeah man so obviously I know we're gonna talk about this
[01:54:43] so we had been there quite a bit and I remember kind of the shock when we first got there talking
[01:54:48] to the two to eight I had my first am there I go to Alfa company and they've got them a memorial outside
[01:54:54] of their compound of all the soldiers that had been killed I can picture it's just kind of like a
[01:54:58] names are on a little placard and it's kind of a tall little pyramid looking thing with the
[01:55:03] names on there and you see it you understand it hey people have died here you get it it's not hard
[01:55:11] to to understand that those things have happened but there's this a level of disconnect when you
[01:55:16] first get there like people are dying but you know you haven't seen it and then you know very
[01:55:21] quick I think probably my second mission out there was kind of a QRF from a vehicle ID so basically
[01:55:26] I'm in a surgeon with a bunch of bombs in his vehicles got on between American Compo and
[01:55:32] blew himself up so I see my first dead body you know I see this real combat people are dying
[01:55:38] here it was an enemy wasn't the same and then you know March April May we started taking I mean
[01:55:47] not started we continue to take casualties and I'm starting to go to memorials and we're starting to
[01:55:51] see guys that we knew and worked with and were friends with and built relations with and
[01:55:56] they're they're they're getting killed or really gravely wounded and those memorials started to
[01:56:01] become every couple of days we're going to a memorial and that sort of ways on you I thought about
[01:56:06] this a lot and how it affected me you know it's a pilot being out of my comfort zone in this environment
[01:56:10] and what that was like but without trying to diminish any of that loss
[01:56:18] there's a there's a disconnect when it's not your person it's not your guy and on June 20th
[01:56:28] so Chris Leon who was my radio operator we were in a building that we had been in let me back up I was
[01:56:34] not there I had left that building that morning gone back to the CUC Adam's team with Chris had
[01:56:39] replaced us and we're basically just going back and forth operations and this this combat outpost
[01:56:43] because it gave us a really good view of the north part of the city and we had to be there basically
[01:56:48] 24 seven and and Chris and and Adam's team had gone back out there and they were supposed to go
[01:56:54] from like 12 to 4 something like that I don't know what it was we gave him like a six-hour shift or
[01:56:58] something and then we were going to kind of figure out if we replace or start over we just sort of
[01:57:04] sent him out there and we're going to come back a little bit and I got to call on the radio
[01:57:08] from the battalion saying hey can you extend your angle go team out here for four hours we're going to
[01:57:12] go do another movement to do some clearing again rush of that hey Adam can you guys stay out
[01:57:17] for another couple hours you know support we're going to get you what not you know standard answer
[01:57:21] yeah Roger that no problem and during that time it was not uncommon to take fire and from that
[01:57:30] in that OP and there was some sniper fire and the first shot there was a younger marina lands
[01:57:39] corporal who was up there and Chris ran up from the other side and kind of put him down you know
[01:57:44] say hey once you get down take cover go go over the other side of the building and Chris got up
[01:57:50] to start to he was doing his observation to try to figure out what was going on and Chris was shot by
[01:57:56] sniper and I get a call kind of very closely after that from Adam you know I'm kind of man in
[01:58:04] the radio's all the time anyway even our home will base there like we're we had a radio right there
[01:58:09] so I was never really not there I was just on the radio say hey corporal landsman hit we're on a
[01:58:14] way back and I was about it I didn't have any real good sense of anything was going on and um
[01:58:23] a little panic sets in like okay and I don't want to press for too much information I get a call
[01:58:29] from alpha company who would who'd manned all the observation posts between where he was and where
[01:58:34] we were that they were clearing make sure the roads were clear they're using their tanks and
[01:58:37] their radlies so they could pick him up and bring a straight shot because that was a pretty busy
[01:58:41] dangerous road you always had to look out for ideas and stuff like that and so everybody's kind of
[01:58:46] picking up the pace to clear out that road and he's coming back and I get a call hey he's breathing
[01:58:52] we're heading straight to Charlie Med and I'm like all right okay I kind of had this sense of this
[01:58:58] is going to be okay Charlie Med is this medical facility on the the camp that we were stationed at
[01:59:06] there and was literally a hundred yards from where I slept and I just ran down to Charlie Med
[01:59:11] to meet the humbill I was there and I'm sorry it wasn't humbill it was a Bradley about the fighting
[01:59:16] vehicle Bradley pulls up myself and my my corpsman dock are there the the the Bradley has a door
[01:59:24] on the back of the body that comes down like a ramp and the ramp comes down he's on a stretcher
[01:59:30] dock goes up to get the front piece of the stretcher I'm at the bottom and he comes down
[01:59:34] carrying the stretcher and Chris is laying on the stretcher and I he went right by my look
[01:59:39] at a minute immediately that he was gone I mean it was gone it was I could see the entrance
[01:59:46] who ended the whole thing was all kind of they had stabilized and they had done their best to kind of
[01:59:49] manage the wood but there was no question that the outcome had already played itself out and Chris was
[01:59:54] gone they take a man to the medical facility which I'd been in and you've been in a dozen times
[02:00:00] for a whole host of different reasons but it always been somebody else I mean I may have known
[02:00:05] that person and been close to that person but it was always somebody else and dock goes in with
[02:00:10] him he's carrying the stretcher and he comes out and probably jack was quite 10 seconds and he just
[02:00:14] comes out with the head shaken and I knew I wasn't holding my breath or I knew but he kind of came
[02:00:21] out and and just sort of I guess confirmed if that's the word I'm looking forward to sort of
[02:00:25] made it official that that Chris had been killed and it sort of initiated just a very strange kind
[02:00:36] of very sequence of events so I I knew Adam and the rest of team were trying to get back and
[02:00:42] they're going to have a slower road back because they're not going to get the support it's just
[02:00:45] going to take a little more time going to get their gear and all the things go along with
[02:00:48] that Chris just got loaded in the humbian and racing back and Bradley they're kind of loaded up
[02:00:53] their humbians and it's just going to take some time and I know like I need to get back to the vehicle
[02:00:57] we parked our trucks because I want to meet them there and I walk back like I said it was maybe
[02:01:02] 100 yards from my hooch to Charlie Man and I get about halfway there and I had this thought that
[02:01:08] that I maybe didn't confirm that Chris was killed and so I actually walked all the way back
[02:01:15] to go find there's a senior medical officer we called him the smoke really awesome guy that dealt
[02:01:19] with all the casualties there who I knew because I had done control I had controlled helicopter
[02:01:24] cast of acts on wounded folks I've been there a lot we did we get blood I mean we were in that facility
[02:01:29] all the time and I I don't know why I needed to do it but I was I I'm just I had a talk
[02:01:39] I'm gonna say is is is is is is is he is he killed is like yeah I'm sorry man you know
[02:01:46] it was kind of an odd conversation I could tell the why he was looking like why I ask him
[02:01:50] this question like it just was one of those things and I was in sort of I think it's a stage
[02:01:55] of disbelief that as I walked back and I was going to deliver the news I had sort of told
[02:01:59] myself like I can't tell them in case what if I'm wrong because I never really went through that
[02:02:04] I saw him I saw Doc but there were no words or exchange and I had this very odd like walking
[02:02:09] back and forth a couple of times and kind of sorting it out and then you know my job was
[02:02:15] next thing I had to do is I Adam I watched the trucks pull up they all get out you know four
[02:02:20] guys and everybody else had heard you know all the angle code teams that were there and we shared
[02:02:24] a facility with EOD and working with everybody you know where did it was passed something had
[02:02:29] happened and I you know a corphing on corphing on stead you know we do something called
[02:02:39] a hero flight and a hero flight is going to be like 1600 I got the information like 10 minutes
[02:02:46] the process of them bringing a casualty that casualty not surviving and then moving they had
[02:02:52] that thing wired and I'd seen it done a bunch of times but it just it was Chris it was my guy
[02:02:58] he was a guy that I just knew differently than everybody else I just saw him differently
[02:03:02] when we entered our trucks he was the back left and I was the front right and our trucks are always
[02:03:07] parked back into their spots so they're always side by side so the back left of his truck
[02:03:11] entered door and the right front of my truck door we always had a fight space for each other
[02:03:17] you know Chris was a standard perfect Marine like he could be 90% of the way through if he
[02:03:22] saw me walking up he'd get out of the way close the door to let me in on my cockman dude like just
[02:03:25] he was a great Marine just I walked past that kid without even really talking him you know a thousand
[02:03:31] times just every single day a couple of times a day and it demystifies as a Marine
[02:03:44] you just live a slightly bit for me I shouldn't say you how it felt for me as I just felt
[02:03:50] with all that was going on and all the destruction and the death and the violence and all the
[02:03:54] things that I'd sort of become accustomed to at that point there's just an aspect of it that's just
[02:03:58] a tiny bit insulated in your life to a really small degree but it's enough to just keep you
[02:04:04] sort of preserved and when Chris was killed it just sort of exposed that it broke down one of my
[02:04:14] last little boundary of I'm I'm okay here because I can do this because I'm gonna get through this I'm
[02:04:21] gonna go home and everything's gonna be okay and that hurt a lot that hurt in ways that I did not
[02:04:32] understand how it was gonna hurt I just didn't I just didn't know what that was gonna be like
[02:04:39] and the the all those next steps and you I know you know this because you you saw it
[02:04:44] he's on a helicopter and he's gone flying away in that 46 in what feels like about a minute
[02:04:51] it's ours and our even rehearsed the movement onto the to carry him onto the hell but
[02:04:58] you go from Chris's city is on his way into watching the helicopter fly away and it feels like
[02:05:02] it takes about that long and then you're just sort of left and you walk back you literally walk away
[02:05:07] from the medical facility where the helicopter just takes off and you walk back on to your original
[02:05:11] you just go back to your room only Chris has gone and it's like that whole deployment kind of
[02:05:17] re I don't know what the right word is it's like I had to start the deployment again because
[02:05:22] all the things that I was dealing with and all things that I was managing and leading is as
[02:05:25] it's a leader would know whatever you want to say was my job it all is sort of change in terms of
[02:05:32] what I thought really well the guys that I was working with everything was different now because it was
[02:05:40] their brother that was gone not somebody else and it's just sort of changed the calculus and
[02:05:45] it really redefined the rest of that deployment and I'll be really really blunt it was hard for me
[02:05:53] to not fold and there was a lot of instinct of like I do not want to do this anymore I do not want
[02:05:58] to be here this is more than I had bargained for and this we can laugh about volunteering and
[02:06:04] being a Marie you know it was a little more than I bargained for and look man we had done some crazy
[02:06:11] stuff at that point and I'd seen some bad things happen I was a participant in some bad things
[02:06:16] and I was okay I was doing okay and I was gonna be okay with that and this one just sort of
[02:06:23] I just it's I struggled with it a little bit so it was a tough day man
[02:06:28] yeah and obviously you know for for us it was you know what a month and a half later
[02:06:38] on August 2nd when Mark got killed and you know I think that's one of the things that
[02:06:44] that we felt you know that little bit of insulation that you're talking about
[02:06:50] we felt that we felt I would say I would say actually more insulated because
[02:06:57] you know my guys were out there taking massive risks getting in crazy gun fights
[02:07:03] getting after it to a degree that no one had ever thought they would and we were doing all right we
[02:07:09] had a couple guys get wounded here and there but they were okay and honestly that guys getting wounded
[02:07:14] you know it's not a devastating wound I mean I had you know one of my guys got wounded early on and
[02:07:20] he almost lost his leg but guess what he didn't and that that didn't make us feel more vulnerable
[02:07:25] in my mind it made us feel stronger and like hey we might get wounded but what we're gonna be good
[02:07:32] and so yeah when Mark got killed and especially Mark who was you know such a
[02:07:36] gargarius and such a guy so full of life that you don't think he can be killed you don't think
[02:07:43] he can be killed and same thing you know that insulation was just completely shattered and I think
[02:07:49] what was also it was it was recognizable it was recognizable to me was that other people outside of
[02:08:00] task munibrusor they fought the same thing they fought hey the seals are here they're gonna they're
[02:08:07] they're gonna they're gonna push through this they're gonna they're gonna win and there nothing's
[02:08:12] gonna happen to them and we saw it you know at the memorial service you could see in guys faces that
[02:08:18] they were they were also their insulation about us was was kind of shattered too and then it
[02:08:27] turns into damn if the seals can get killed where am I at I think that was another thing that
[02:08:34] that really you know that was another thing that really just made Mark get and killed such a
[02:08:38] such an impact to all of us there there's no doubt that what you just said is exactly how
[02:08:44] it played out you were the first guy to talk to me when Chris's helicopter flies away it's
[02:08:51] literally dusty and you know the helicopter's loud and it kicks up dust there and it was dark it was
[02:08:56] nighttime and you came up to me and I don't remember the exact words but we were just turning around
[02:09:02] and walking back and you said something like we're gonna get after this guys and we're gonna
[02:09:07] go find the cybersitter doing this something to those wars and it was basically like we're
[02:09:11] gonna take care of this and I remember feeling really comforted by that like yeah man yeah go do
[02:09:19] that that's awesome and feeling good about that that we weren't helpless and we're just gonna
[02:09:25] suck it up and deal with this just this terrible loss that we're gonna get something from this
[02:09:30] we're gonna go find some guys and go get after it and we're gonna go kill these guys and you
[02:09:36] guys we're gonna you guys are gonna make that happen and I remember feeling I remember how that
[02:09:41] felt and look June 20th August 2nd just like everything else was a blur man it was like
[02:09:47] it might as well just been the next day because things happened so fast there and I was
[02:09:53] you know I wasn't on the patrol on the on August 2nd but I was on the radio I was
[02:09:58] got to run in the air I was doing all the same stuff we always did you know and I was back in
[02:10:02] the CUC with you working that mission all that stuff that happened and before you know it we're
[02:10:08] watching that helicopter fly away you know or he's gone you know and you and you're seeing
[02:10:16] the the the aftermath of that and I actually went back last night to look at my journal entry
[02:10:21] for that day because I ended up running down Charlie Medigan because that's where everybody came in
[02:10:26] and I remember seeing Lave there you know Lave was a guy I don't work with the ton and
[02:10:29] there he is he's got a wound I'm looking at him over I'm saying over as I told her they kind of
[02:10:32] shirt off they're they're they're attending to Lave who was Lave was a larger than life
[02:10:40] you know for guy like me who always kind of fell to a little bit like what the hell am I doing
[02:10:44] her man without my doing with the seals like this isn't sane these guys are just they're just
[02:10:50] larger than life and to see the exposure of that it bothered me and I knew I had the feeling of
[02:10:59] holy cow if this can happen to these guys you know can happen any of us and it's not a good
[02:11:05] feeling and when you saw the guys from the team who it was just it was just everything was
[02:11:08] scrambling and it was just that sense of and I don't want to make a sound like it wasn't
[02:11:12] a pain nobody's panicking or freaking out it was not like that but it was just a tiny bit
[02:11:18] chaotic that makes sense on a small degree but enough when you were so used to just being
[02:11:23] completely not like that that feeling like when Chris loss was it what I felt was like
[02:11:31] oh man I'm not really in good chill any of this I am not in control all that stuff that I've told
[02:11:36] myself all that comfort and confidence and we're getting better and I'm gonna be more effective
[02:11:42] and do more good work until the thing is over it was like no negative that could be you that could
[02:11:49] happen today and then it and between Chris and Mark the army suffered oh I'm God bless we
[02:12:00] are going to memorials like every couple of days people are getting killed all the time and
[02:12:04] everyone of those you wrote that that confidence a little bit and when it happened to Mark and
[02:12:10] Dave that was hard to see that and it that was the feeling that I had it was like yeah
[02:12:23] maybe I'm just lucky you know maybe I maybe this whole thing is just luck
[02:12:29] now look we we regrouped I mean June 20th was a bad day you know we did all the things
[02:12:39] we did the morning we paid our our we ordered him the right way you guys can't we did it the right way and we
[02:12:44] acknowledged Chris but if you kind of think what's gone in the middle of June man there was no
[02:12:52] taken a knee there was no like let's hold off for a second catcher breath the bullet chain was just
[02:12:57] running and as a matter of fact it was just gonna it was actually just gonna get a ton worse you remember
[02:13:00] July and August were just they were insane they were insane so we we lost Chris really at the
[02:13:06] big ramp up you know we had done a big movement in earlier in June and we were really starting
[02:13:11] to lay into the city but the real you know the crazy jay block you know that kind of stuff all
[02:13:16] that stuff was all out in front of us and so for me it was you know my entire career I've done a
[02:13:22] whole bunch of really great stuff in my career and nothing is even nothing is even it's not anymore talking
[02:13:27] about what anything else in my career has meant compared to that deployment and then that day I mean
[02:13:33] it's just light years different and it was like you gotta get up and go do it the very next
[02:13:40] day and it's a remember going that first patrol that first mission and trying to that feeling of
[02:13:46] okay yeah it's different and you got I think you've got one of two ways to go with that it's either
[02:13:50] gonna get inside your heading kind of mess with you and break you a little bit and and I could feel
[02:13:54] that happening or you just you just you just don't you just shut it down and just go do it
[02:14:00] and I found how to compartmentalize you know I'd come back I'd have moments when I was back
[02:14:07] on my whoochup and the roof by myself I have my moments man no I don't want anybody to think
[02:14:10] that I didn't I had plenty of those moments this is matter fact I I still do to be honest with you
[02:14:15] I still have my moments I go visit Chris her allington on his birthday I go visit Chris and
[02:14:19] that day he was killed I go to visit Chris Memorial Day his mom comes out I see cat she and I
[02:14:25] were very close I have my moments without a doubt but the rest of the three months in Ramadi
[02:14:33] there was just not there wasn't a ton of time to do that so I guess I kind of just saved it
[02:14:38] maybe for for when I came back and it it was there I mean it it's not good but yeah man
[02:14:46] so then you you do come back I mean obviously like you said it ramped up it ramped up all the time
[02:14:57] and the guys were just you know everybody like I'm not just talking about our guys I'm talking
[02:15:02] about everybody it ramped up hardcore it got hotter outside the the the combat got more intense
[02:15:09] the enemy started fighting harder they got more square away and like you said you and the rest of
[02:15:20] the guys there did the mission day after day night after night and then one day you fly home
[02:15:30] yeah and how was that transition for you getting back to the states
[02:15:43] interesting it was an interesting transition so from the time that I left Ramadi
[02:15:50] so you would pack up our stuff we left Ramadi I think we weren't to co-8 for day or two
[02:15:54] went to Lujoon went to Japan because I had to check out both places Jack I think it was six days
[02:16:02] on the calendar from the day I left Ramadi to the day I landed on a plane in San Diego
[02:16:08] which at the time was all I wanted I was the and I've been fairly good about this right my
[02:16:12] career is when I want things to happen administratively I can make those things happen
[02:16:18] but if I catch one that there's a flight from Japan to San Diego and I can get on that flight
[02:16:23] I'm gonna get on that flight even if my CEO is the young me like how did you get out of here so fast
[02:16:26] like I have the same in the guy in the paper and I got to go and I'm out I wanted to get out quickly
[02:16:31] so I found myself in San Diego executing my next orders which the Marine Corps said you go to
[02:16:37] Ramadi you do the fact you're gonna do the fact you're gonna go back to San Diego from there
[02:16:42] which will be your next at order so I knew while I was in Iraq that San Diego was in my future my wife had
[02:16:47] already moved down there I told you she was living with my best friend Neil who was on that
[02:16:51] fact tour before me so I go in Ramadi his battalion comes home we show up my wife and my best friend
[02:16:57] and living together in San Diego which was really good for her because he was able to kind of
[02:17:03] keep her aware of what's going on but knew exactly how to explain it in a way that wasn't
[02:17:08] gonna freak her out and he also took it out so he knew how to downplay hey I would call hey we're
[02:17:13] doing this no big deal I mean I didn't I wasn't telling him half of what the hell was going on I
[02:17:17] wouldn't you not gonna share those stories so he was a really great resource for her I paid very
[02:17:22] little time worrying about it to be honest with you I was comfortable that she had a good
[02:17:27] support structure which she really didn't we we got married I deployed four months later to Ramadi
[02:17:34] she she started dating a dude who was driving a Corvette and living in Tahoe as a top
[02:17:37] owner structure and and four months after we got married I was in Ramadi so there was no like
[02:17:44] easing so I knew there was just I didn't know at the time didn't think of it but it was
[02:17:49] obvious that looking back that she was just thrown into an environment that she was totally unprepared for
[02:17:56] now forget about just me being gone but just the fact that I was in Ramadi and it's all over
[02:17:59] the news everybody knew it was going on I think one of my Marines is killing me a lot of crazy
[02:18:02] stuff going on and next thing you know I'm home September 28 I'm back in San Diego like
[02:18:07] three hundred sixty five days to the day I'm home and I checked into an F-18 squadron like the
[02:18:13] day after I got home before October 1st I was back into an F-18 squadron San Diego which is insane
[02:18:23] and I to be really blunt I was you know all those guys in Anglican went back to Anglican
[02:18:30] and can't push you in can't handsome in in Japan I was like later bros you know like
[02:18:35] no longer buys you know high five great deployment you know I'm out I was just on other things
[02:18:41] and I kind of extricated myself it's you know I fall the rules I do whatever supposed to do and
[02:18:45] before I know it I'm back there and I honestly I think also kind of kidding myself like that was
[02:18:51] the best thing for me let's get home I knew something was a on this because on the drive home
[02:18:58] from the airport I find a San Diego international just down the road my wife and my my mom who lives in
[02:19:04] San Diego both of them came to pick me up from the airport you've already met my mom great lady
[02:19:08] my wife and my mom picked me up from the airport I got pictures of them meeting me there
[02:19:11] getting the car drive from San Diego international to our house in Pacific Beach and as we're
[02:19:17] pulling like on to Chelsea any up to the house I like screamed at them told them stop talking
[02:19:27] or something like that I said something like I don't even I don't know what it was but I
[02:19:31] think I just remember sitting in the passenger seat and some the gears just start I'm in a truck
[02:19:36] or a car I like whenever I don't know what it was but something's going on and I think just
[02:19:40] the pressure is building and I'm and I have no sense of what's going on I know out of for it
[02:19:44] and they're like having a perfectly normal adult conversation that might have been an octave above
[02:19:51] when I was willing to accept her tolerate maybe and I completely freaked out on my wife and my
[02:19:56] mom let's see in the year and you know they were like oh sorry you know they were super cool no push back
[02:20:02] and it was an indicator like yeah you recognize that immediately like oh god yeah immediately
[02:20:10] and it was that combination recognition of that's not good and clearly I have I have things I
[02:20:18] need to deal with that I wasn't quite aware of so I knew no question right away and I think
[02:20:23] about this a lot with other marines and the things you experience in combat you've talked about
[02:20:28] PTSD a lot look that's the subject you could spend hours on the bottom lines everybody deals with
[02:20:33] things differently doesn't mean you're broken or messed it just it just means you have some
[02:20:37] process you gotta go through and you gotta deal with them we all deal with it differently I had
[02:20:41] maybe talk myself into out 33 as fairly experienced guy I was surrounded by very young marines
[02:20:47] who maybe in my mind didn't have maybe the emotional maturity maybe the life skills to maybe
[02:20:55] manage some of these same chaotic things you know guys at saw Chris get shot you know I maybe kind
[02:21:01] of built myself up a little bit as a little better equipped and I was better equipped in my mind
[02:21:05] and I was I in a matter of 45 minutes from the airport to the house I'm flying off the handle
[02:21:11] on something so it just all it was man it was it was those two things like that's not good
[02:21:20] and this is gonna probably happen again I'm gonna need to I'm gonna need to think about this I
[02:21:24] can't pretend like I'm not gonna just have some sort of residual you can't leave Ramadi
[02:21:29] being San Diego six days later and not bring some baggage home with you and I was bringing some
[02:21:32] baggage home and there's some baggage there a little bit so that transition was was it started
[02:21:43] is there anything that like anything that helped you yeah dude I'll tell you what helped the most
[02:21:48] is my best friend who had been in Ramadi and endured all of that loss the look our story you know
[02:21:54] the the guys that we replaced the guys that replaced us it's a very similar story a lot they understand
[02:21:59] that you know I think having an outlet having one other dude it happened to be my best friend
[02:22:04] super 14 so it was you want to talk about just hitting the jackpot and being the best equipped
[02:22:10] sort of just deal and power through it and and and accept what's going on and and embrace it and
[02:22:14] all those things that go on with it I had an outlet man I had my best friend who I mean he knew
[02:22:19] every place we were I mean it wasn't even like oh he was here now it was the same place yeah
[02:22:24] because Ramadi's not that big it's just not that big man and so we say I was on the corner
[02:22:28] of sunset mission is like yeah there are 500 times yeah and and he was struggling a little bit
[02:22:35] too you know again I it's all relative I mean we're handled it relatively okay you know I'm going
[02:22:41] back to kind of dealing in normal life and but the moment when you get those little spikes and those
[02:22:45] is what kind of comes up and get you those little spikes was a sort of unforeseen kind of reactions
[02:22:50] he could see that in me and I could see that in him we had actually been really we're really good
[02:22:53] for each other when I see him kind of get a little shaky a little break like I'm not you know he's
[02:22:58] not digging his environment a little bit or he'd see that of me you had that other person I kind
[02:23:02] of bring you back to helping you helping you deal with that which is good the flip side of that
[02:23:09] while it was really helpful for him to be there I think it was really tough on Whitney because she
[02:23:15] was not my outlet for that I wasn't kind of got cut out totally and not I didn't certainly not
[02:23:21] by design I'm not like doing this calculation if I don't want my head she's not I'm not going to
[02:23:25] use her as a resource you know for that and to be honest with you too there's also a little part
[02:23:28] of you know what the corner of Michigan sunset is like so totally man and I'll I'll be really
[02:23:34] candid you know I I think I would have been almost embarrassed is maybe not the right word but I
[02:23:41] I wasn't I don't know if I wanted to see that part of it you know I mean like hey they check
[02:23:46] at this ridiculous of own vulnerability that I have right now that I'm going to carry with me
[02:23:49] for God that was how long that's going to come up I didn't know where and you're going to have
[02:23:53] to just deal with it so there was a I think the thing that bothered me the most and was part of
[02:23:58] just kind of getting back to day to day life was it I would get when things didn't go well when
[02:24:03] I had my moments my irrational is just I just get pissed off it was that feeling of so you I have this
[02:24:09] like some event would happen something stupid would catch my attention and kind of height my
[02:24:14] you know my response and because it happened I'd be annoyed myself that I let it that I let it
[02:24:19] bother me and then I'd be pissed off of myself because I let it bother me you know me like this ridiculous
[02:24:24] cycle of I told you the story the other day my wife and I shoot I guarantee you she remembers
[02:24:29] this tour we're walking across the street downtown no no by the beat I think and an auto body
[02:24:35] shop is running the the air drill to pull some tires off I can root you know that kind of sound
[02:24:41] and as we're walking I think my left arm is over her her shoulder we're walking like this
[02:24:47] I hear that sound and my first reaction is I've pushed her down to the ground and in the time that it
[02:24:51] takes to do that and catch that it's happening is maybe a third of a second you know what I mean
[02:24:58] so I hear it I do the I'm I'm reacting and pushing her to the ground I'm kind of getting on top of
[02:25:04] her to do look what up to oh that's the car it's not a thing there's no reason for you to do this
[02:25:10] is about a third of a second and what bothered me the most about it is that I did it not that I
[02:25:15] felt like that is it I reacted to it and I was like embarrassed like what's wrong with me to
[02:25:20] to go through that and she's like what the you know and I it sounded like you know and kind
[02:25:26] of going through the whole thing and I think just the the fact that I had responses pissed me off
[02:25:31] and I would just kind of honestly I have a temper about it and that was she got to see me just
[02:25:36] get pissed off itself for no real good reason which you never really get pissed off like I mean
[02:25:42] I have tempered some pictures stuff that just I would get mad about stuff that just didn't make sense
[02:25:47] I mean I have a temper about things that my computer pisses me off just like it pisses you off
[02:25:52] man that's totally normal right I would get I would have reactions to stuff that just there was
[02:25:57] no way for her to say oh that makes sense I understand it would just be this totally odd ball
[02:26:03] somebody would say something wrong just it would just trigger in ways that she would look at me
[02:26:07] and kind of be like who are you she knew all my flaws she knew everything right along with me and
[02:26:12] all of a sudden now I'm doing all of those stuff for another little thing in the mix so I got my
[02:26:17] wife who we get married I leave a go on this diploma and I come back I'm home for maybe seven
[02:26:21] months before I deploy again in that seven months you know welcome to marriage to Dave Burke you
[02:26:29] know that involves a year long deployment seven months and I rack you know
[02:26:33] God oh knows what the hell I was you know I'm back to work so I'm back at a squadron as the
[02:26:37] exo you know work in ridiculous exo hours in a fighter squadron prepping to go into deployment
[02:26:43] I I voluntarily extend my time to make the deployment which is exactly what you should do at the
[02:26:49] beginning of your marriage is volunteer to extend on a deployment I got accepted into grad school
[02:26:54] I was going to go to Dartmouth I was getting out of the Marine Corps I was going to go to get my MBA
[02:26:59] and I remember the conversation of hey I'm going to extend ask me to extend and you know
[02:27:06] as explaining why I was going to do what I was going to do and she's like why why would you do that
[02:27:10] and I said so I can deploy and you hear those words like god did I just say that to my wife like
[02:27:19] which is so I cannot be with you so I can be apart from you so I can hang out the boys and go do that
[02:27:24] you know I mean not retire from the ring you've got to know the Marine Corps so I can not do all these
[02:27:28] other things that I'm not set up this future that I told you all about and so do you on totally
[02:27:32] so to say that my wife and and everybody's got those stories the laundry list of reasons why she
[02:27:38] should have just sort of cut bait and be like no this is not happening is a lot longer than
[02:27:43] the list of reasons why she shouldn't have and props were good she's here and my marriage with her
[02:27:51] you know for all the ups and downs it goes on get everybody's marriage the one thing I don't worry
[02:27:55] about even even when we're at our worst at our absolute worst which our worst is whatever it is we have
[02:28:01] our worst moments at our absolute worst I don't have a shred and have a brain cell of thought of
[02:28:06] I wonder if our marriage is going to survive this you know this throat animal having over god knows
[02:28:10] what you know so we hit kind of went through the fire there and she she got forged yeah big time
[02:28:17] she's a stud she deserves mad props for going through that because I'm not really sure why she did
[02:28:22] to be honest with you she said you know what I can't come up with a good reason to go she had a lot of
[02:28:30] options on the table I'm not sure yeah so it was that transition was tough man you so now you're
[02:28:36] in another squadron you go on to point me again which is another what what are you doing on that
[02:28:40] deployment just more so I'm back in an F-18 squadron on the exo and the opposite I actually did
[02:28:44] both jobs on this deployment we just go to Japan it's a Westtime okay Western Pacific we're back
[02:28:48] in Iwakuni and and Ocanala just doing yeah exercise exercise training I kind of stuff
[02:28:54] get done with that and so now maybe it's time to get out of the Marine Corps before I left
[02:28:58] on that deployment I had told my commander the group commander and the squadron commander hey
[02:29:02] this is it for me I'm hanging it up it's been awesome I happily to extend for this deployment
[02:29:07] that they need to me to go on I was great experience I got to train a bunch of young guys
[02:29:10] life was good but they knew before I left that I was going to be out of the Marine Corps
[02:29:14] at the end of that I deferred at Dartmouth for a year paid my non-refundable deposit which I
[02:29:19] have never gotten back it wasn't that's why they call it non-refundable right absolutely
[02:29:24] there oh my point I wasn't kicking around the idea of getting out I was in full execution we had
[02:29:29] looked at houses like we were in execution this was merely a detour to get to that end state
[02:29:35] and what I'm doing back from that deployment in January I think it is of the following year
[02:29:39] and it it turns out that the Marine Corps wants to send a guy to go fly F-22s for the
[02:29:48] with the year force for three years and they're accepting applications for the F-22 Raptor
[02:29:54] Exchange which had never been happened before never happened since there was a one time thing
[02:29:58] and the guy got it they picked you know it was going to go to non-deploying in NLS and fly the F-22
[02:30:04] Raptor should properly apply I guess it seems like a reasonable thing to do because if they say no then
[02:30:11] yeah I'll just go to play I'll go get my MBA it's all good and Lone Behold at the end of December
[02:30:18] I get the word that I got picked up for this Raptor Exchange and I remember calling it
[02:30:25] in my head and I did the standard day work over sell hey no deploying we're going to go to you know
[02:30:36] it's all there's all the goodness there's no downside you know and she's like shut up you know
[02:30:41] she's and she was good with it you know it was it was it was just another one of those things like
[02:30:46] I can't say no to this this is just something that doesn't happen and you just don't get to
[02:30:50] nobody gets to fly the F-22 in the Marine Corps because the Marine Corps is a fly of 22
[02:30:55] same thing I said when I flew F-16's in Top Gun and all this sort of stuff so it was just
[02:30:59] another thing that I just couldn't believe was happening and I couldn't leave the Marine Corps
[02:31:04] saying I walked away from that I just couldn't and she was totally unbored and okay moment
[02:31:10] didn't get back my non-refundable deposit and uh move the Vegas and start to fly in the F-22 Raptor
[02:31:16] three years up there and then at some point that roll this door oh yeah and that rolls into the F-35
[02:31:22] at some point so I'm fine we're F-22's how many people were flying the F-22 at this point
[02:31:29] so we probably had I knew at the time what number I was I think I might have been
[02:31:37] in the 100 something you know we had two squadrons that were stood up you know and it was
[02:31:43] starting to pick up the pace was early 2008 so the Raptor was just starting to get its legs
[02:31:47] underneath it was starting to building more and it was starting to become a thing and the Marine
[02:31:51] Corps had this idea that they're gonna they're gonna build this new stealth airplane called the F-35
[02:31:54] and they're gonna get it and they wanted somebody to go to the Air Force to learn all the
[02:31:59] airplanes are really similar there's a goal still all their experience and all the pain that they've
[02:32:03] gone through to stand up this thing and then you're gonna bring it back to the Marine Corps so the
[02:32:07] deal was this F-22 gig was it was really high probability I was gonna go right from the F-22 to the F-35
[02:32:12] and command the first operational squadron and the lone-boiled man that's exactly what happened we
[02:32:17] went to Tindall we lived in Tindall for three months when I went through training and
[02:32:23] that was awesome we were living on the beach in Florida for three months it get trained in the
[02:32:26] Raptor we moved out to Vegas lived there for three plus years started a family to my first two kids
[02:32:32] were born in Las Vegas we were we're killing it man I mean it was awesome and as I'm getting
[02:32:38] ready to leave Vegas I get selected to command the first operational there was a guy there before
[02:32:44] they didn't have airplanes they had a guy there was another seal before me but I was gonna go out
[02:32:48] there and accept and start flying the first F-35's the Marine Corps I show up and this poor guy
[02:32:53] was selected to do the same thing the two years prior great dude but you know we'd stayed in touch
[02:32:58] and we were always in contact and helping them stand up with everything and and I get there
[02:33:03] Jacob I'm there I think two days and the first airplane showed up and I'm like what's the
[02:33:09] what's the big deal he spent two years in CSing airplane working I'm there all this paper work
[02:33:14] grinding doing all this has been a straight stuff to prep he gets nowhere plans use you up two days
[02:33:18] that are boom did the amount of work that him and his guys went through to stand up the squadron
[02:33:22] I literally showed up at the work in the next day the first airplane landed yeah that's my new
[02:33:27] nickname for you like this really isn't that hard man what's the big deal and and he and I did a turn
[02:33:33] over and he left and sort of flying up 35's and you know that's a whole part of my career we
[02:33:41] could spend hours on that but I flew the rapture which was an amazing airplane and I flew the
[02:33:46] 35 which was an amazing airplane and I got to totally be relevant in aviation I had sort of exhausted
[02:33:53] I did all the things I wanted to do in the Hornet I loved that airplane I did top
[02:33:57] and I kind of had reached all the things and we talked about this too when when you leave top gun
[02:34:03] you're never going to be that good ever again so it's just a matter of how slow you can make the
[02:34:08] process of getting worse it's just how can you slow it down to be as good as you can knowing
[02:34:14] that you will never be as good as you were there because you're just you're never going to get the
[02:34:17] reps again ever you're just never going to get it and so it's just a matter of kind of slowing
[02:34:22] down that process and at some point in your mind like I don't want to be in this business if I'm not
[02:34:27] at the top of my game when I flew the I have 22 I didn't have a job I didn't I wasn't I wasn't the
[02:34:34] absolute of a squadron which is what I just showed up in the food place I just showed up in
[02:34:37] food the plan I had some leadership responsibility in in the organization so grab the keys from
[02:34:41] someone take it out of spin yeah run into the ground right a little report and be like bring
[02:34:46] a back and get the keys back to the maintenance guys and yeah hey this thing is broken give me another one
[02:34:50] it was it was awesome yeah so I did that totally great for for my marriage my I was able to
[02:34:58] combine all these professional interests with great which you don't get to do in the Marine Corps
[02:35:03] when there's a war going on you just don't get to do that and here I am and do I had no more friends
[02:35:08] in the Marine Corps man nobody liked me they're all doing back to back to back to Poem
[02:35:13] it's an airplanes are breaking and I'm living in Vegas flying the raptor all my bros were like
[02:35:18] we're done with you man we got nothing for you so you know I was just I was felt guilty I
[02:35:23] did not feel guilty but I almost did yeah almost did and then I go out we moved to
[02:35:29] Destin Florida you know or or Fort Altman Beach and we lived in Niceville and this awesome house
[02:35:33] in this great community and I was the first pilot to ever fly the 35th be operationally in the
[02:35:38] world ridiculous did that probably two and a half years and it was awesome and then you what brought
[02:35:45] you up to DC so what brought me up to DC so I was I was so sure that I was going to leave the
[02:35:52] Marine Corps after that command tour they have 35 that I reapplyed a Dartmouth got back in again
[02:35:57] got accepted to do you have to give another deposit no I was I was smart enough not to pay the deposit
[02:36:03] because there's a tiny little possibility that was going to work out anyway I did get into Dartmouth
[02:36:06] again and it's like babe I'm going to go to get my MBA I was wanted to get my MBA and I got selected
[02:36:13] for an academic fellowship where I basically got to go to grad school for a year I went to
[02:36:19] say the semi-dejons Hopkins University to give my masters and I basically went to DC it was a
[02:36:25] civilian for a year and between those two things is another terrible deal like the Marine
[02:36:31] Corps like to pay you to go be a full-time student at Johns Hopkins which which they did
[02:36:37] so we moved up to DC and I went to Johns Hopkins to get my masters and then the next thing
[02:36:42] they offered you is to go back and yeah so from there the the payback of that good deal was
[02:36:49] to go to the Pentagon which was totally reasonable thing I'd post command I'd been to school
[02:36:54] I mean it certainly couldn't complain about how tough my life was in the Marine Corps since
[02:36:58] you know the last eight years or whatever it was and I just went basically did a desk job in the
[02:37:03] Pentagon and I worked for and the joint staff and the chairman joined Chiefs of Staff just working
[02:37:08] some project it wasn't all that exciting it was I learned a bunch but it was just kind of a
[02:37:12] kind of a med job I was you know very nine to five strict hours don't take work on we know black
[02:37:17] Barry no real responsibility pretty chill life life was pretty good I selected I picked up Colonel while I was there
[02:37:27] the end of 2015 I was selected for Colonel and in the summer of 2016 I selected for a command
[02:37:34] again as a Colonel this time to command and have 35 squadron but I didn't want to do that
[02:37:44] I don't know how this is going to come across so the people listening and what a terrible deal
[02:37:48] was the Marine Corps asked if it would be a Colonel and go fly up 35 again and I'm not I'm not
[02:37:53] I don't want this to come across that I was complaining but what I the one thing that I
[02:37:59] in all those great deals and dude they were great deals the thing that I was missing the most
[02:38:05] was that I always kind of felt like I had one foot in a one foot out they were these non-deploying jobs the Air Force
[02:38:10] exchange the the F 35 job was kind of standing up a squadron we weren't prepping for anything and I
[02:38:19] loved it but I could feel sort of underneath the surface I got a lack of investment I could tell I
[02:38:29] just wasn't I didn't have to be 100 set pot committed because there was no we're going to go to
[02:38:34] deploy or we're going to go to there was no thing that was going to happen and I think one of the
[02:38:39] healthiest things about being in the Marine Corps is always prepping for something so even the
[02:38:42] crappy stuff you don't want to do you know hey we got to do this because the end state is this
[02:38:47] and I was missing that and it sort of over time started to erode a little bit that I did I was
[02:38:52] catching myself on a little slack in the line to be honest with you I to be really blunt I didn't
[02:38:59] have to bring my a game every day I just didn't I could do the things that I was doing certainly
[02:39:03] in airplane because there was just an element that there was no outcome to what I was preparing for
[02:39:09] and I started to kind of find other interests like school became really interesting to me I did that
[02:39:14] year and so I continued my education jobs options and started working towards my MBA because I needed
[02:39:19] something or wanted something else and once you kind of catch in your mind that the Marine Corps
[02:39:26] and what they're asking you to do I was going to go back to a training squadron I wanted to go to
[02:39:29] be an operational commander with operational units that are preparing to go something I wasn't
[02:39:33] going to get to do that I was going to go back to a training environment I caught myself
[02:39:39] losing the thing that was the most passionate about the Marine Corps and seeing it's more of like
[02:39:44] okay three years here this will get me to this retirement and this amount of money and it was just
[02:39:48] starting to become a little too professional and not enough a passion and I don't mean to say I was
[02:39:54] going to need to feel like a 21 year old again I you don't need to recreate it like that but my
[02:39:59] life actually sat me down with her talking and she just kind of looked at me as like dude you're
[02:40:03] not going to be happy doing this it was really clear to her I think even more clear than it was
[02:40:08] for me it's hard to come across as ungrateful but I I could I was not going to be good at that job
[02:40:17] because there was something that was missing it was something that I didn't there was nothing
[02:40:21] that I about it that it made me feel passionate about doing it so no joke man last year August I
[02:40:29] basically told that I declined command I declined promotion and I put it for her time and all the same
[02:40:33] day and that was a big move man the big move that created a little splash out there in the world
[02:40:41] yeah maybe it was it didn't it surprised everybody but my wife obviously she was totally
[02:40:49] got it and I knew it was the right thing in my closest buddy so I mean I talked to my
[02:40:52] bros my tight my bros those guys understood but yeah it was a big move and I was turning
[02:40:57] down what by a whole right by all rights was a really good great deal another great deal down
[02:41:03] about it and then at some point you show up at a different kind of event in Virginia with
[02:41:12] Lafen Eye working with a company for our company Ashland front we're doing a leadership training
[02:41:19] for a company and you decided to come down and check it out Lafen said come on down check this out
[02:41:25] see what you think of this yeah so Lafen talked to me a couple years ago when I was leaving
[02:41:31] that F-35 job before I went up to DC and he's like hey man joc on our doing this thing it's going to be
[02:41:36] awesome um we'd love to you know talk about it and I'm like hey man I'm I'm I'm all in this other
[02:41:42] gig I'm going to school I'm going to the Marine Corps we in state and touch I mean Lafen's
[02:41:48] buddy I mean is a guy that that I appreciate it you know the times that we reconnected here and
[02:41:51] there and I certainly appreciate it the call but it just really wasn't in the calculator and I wasn't
[02:41:55] really I wasn't there so I when I told him like hey man I dropped my letter I'm getting out
[02:42:04] and like I said Lafen isn't always the easiest guy to get a hold of right away to talk sometimes
[02:42:08] he's he's got a lot on his place a busy guy and he texted me back right then I'm on the bus
[02:42:13] leaving the Pentagon is I hid you up time to talk right now so he calls me and we talk for I mean
[02:42:19] probably a solid 45 minutes to an hour and he's like hey joc on our going to be up in Vienna here
[02:42:24] in a couple weeks once you come out for the day I'm like okay right on and he gave me you know
[02:42:31] I like I was following you guys I knew it was going on I was seeing what you're doing things were blowing up
[02:42:35] I was something bragging on my buddy's life in jocot anybody there was listening to me about it
[02:42:40] and I watched you know you and Lafen give this presentation up there in Vienna to this group and
[02:42:48] dude
[02:42:50] you were it was awesome man you were the smile on your face we you know we got done and
[02:42:57] that first day and we sat down with you you were in big time like I am in I want to do this
[02:43:04] this is all you were pumped and yeah and I think that was you know and then and then actually
[02:43:09] we did I brought you up and we did an event with another company yeah and that you're now involved
[02:43:16] with for a long term and and even then you know because then for us you know I wanted to see what
[02:43:22] you were going to do and see how you were going to do it and man I was like I don't know you gave
[02:43:27] your first two paragraphs of talking you know your first two minutes of of explaining something
[02:43:32] I was like okay cool I'm good and I was you know just everything that we talk about all the time
[02:43:39] you know that's in the book and hearing you describe things from the book but with your view on
[02:43:46] it and your angle and it's it's refreshing to me and also I'm just I'm even learning right so
[02:43:52] I'm here in a different angle and like I talk about with with everything it was like we just talked
[02:43:57] about with with flying at top gun or like it isn't your jitter or like it isn't the battlefield
[02:44:01] the more different angles you can see something from the better you're going to get at it and so
[02:44:05] here I am listening to you going oh there's another angle yep here we go so that was awesome and it was
[02:44:10] also the first time you know with J.P. same thing you know I I listened to J. but it's like the
[02:44:16] first time J.P. you came with me and he was just sitting in the back like what you did the first time
[02:44:19] he was sitting in the back and and I say man come come on you know when when I do this Q&A answer some
[02:44:24] questions and you know I'm thinking hey if something goes sideways I'll just be able to cover for
[02:44:29] him no big deal you know somebody asked a question and J.P. kind of gives me a look like hey
[02:44:34] well I'll answer this and I was like okay you know go ahead I'll just cover for you just
[02:44:38] just give us an awesome answer I'm like okay I'll sit down now and it's the same thing with you I was
[02:44:43] like you know you're thinking okay where's he gonna go with this with this is a tough question or
[02:44:47] whatever and boom here you go you know fire for a fact and both those two events happened really close
[02:44:53] together for me and for for me it was and I call actually called life I think it was the next day
[02:45:00] or is I might have been that evening and I said hey life you know we're good to go like we are not
[02:45:06] gonna have to do all of this ourselves because Dave and J.P. can do this they get it they can they
[02:45:13] can do it and which was you know everybody in their own I don't want to think it's arrogance
[02:45:19] but it's it's just you don't see it and so you kind of think how is any you know it's like when
[02:45:25] you're in command of something that's one of the really hard things to do is let go you know and
[02:45:27] and life's talked about this all the time you know when I'd be watching him roll out on out the gate
[02:45:32] for his first mission I done all kinds of missions like that and here he's going out of his first one
[02:45:37] that he's in charge of and you're thinking man I should just go I want to go and I want to go and
[02:45:41] and then you know two hours it comes back and you're like high five you and then you go cool I
[02:45:45] don't have to be the guy that goes every time and so when when I saw you when I saw J.P. you know it's like
[02:45:50] this is awesome and I called life and said we are gonna be good to go other guys they can do this
[02:45:56] they can bring the same message they can bring the same passion and power and knowledge and that was
[02:46:00] very very you know refreshing to me and bottom line is the experiences are the same I mean they're
[02:46:08] not exactly the same but the the experience and the body is the same and then the experience that we
[02:46:13] had throughout our military career and now you get to see what it's like interacting with businesses
[02:46:18] and you see all those similarities so that was a that was a big day and so in case I haven't made this
[02:46:23] clear yet Dave now is with us part of the echelon front team and doing what we do helping businesses
[02:46:32] with their leadership in their companies so it's awesome it's awesome having you on
[02:46:39] it's huge for me I told you I love you know I love the Marine Corps I'm they're something missing
[02:46:43] and I can't I can't stay in Marine because there's something missing well you leave the Marine Corps
[02:46:46] like how in the hell am I gonna recreate that thing that I'm looking for not in the military it's
[02:46:53] all I know is that's the place and that was my biggest my biggest fear was I'm not gonna go like
[02:46:59] go to work you know go do something that I so I was worried like I got to find something and
[02:47:07] that's part of the reason why that first gig with you guys in the back was like holy cow man
[02:47:11] you you've got to be kidding me it's all those things you just discussed all those things I spent
[02:47:17] on a whole life living and breathing and learning and and and then it's with people like
[02:47:23] late in jocco from where my work we're gonna do this together yeah so good deal Dave
[02:47:30] you kidding me yeah dude I wasn't on monster dot com searching for employment opportunities
[02:47:37] late call me he's at come to Vienna my dad okay my head was a million miles away man
[02:47:42] I'm just working through paperwork to drop my letter out to leave the Marine Corps like very
[02:47:46] hastily with no no plan B there was no I'm leaving to do this you can ask when you like there was
[02:47:52] zero conversation about what I'm gonna do and I came back from them like obviously here's the plan
[02:48:00] and dude he was instantaneous for me it was instantaneous and then to be able to share that
[02:48:07] message and believe it and have all those feelings and in a totally different way and to work with you
[02:48:12] guys yeah and it's cool too because you get that kind of for you top gun for me working in the training
[02:48:19] command where it's like like what I already talked about you you have this experience and when I
[02:48:25] was getting out I'm saying what am I gonna do with this thing what am I gonna do that I got all this
[02:48:28] knowledge and I thought okay well I guess I'll put it in a cruise box over here lock it up and it'll
[02:48:32] you know it'll fade away and turn in dust but when you realize that you can take what you learned
[02:48:39] and you can apply it to all these you know civilian civilians and civilian companies it's it's
[02:48:45] pretty it's a pretty damn good feeling to have and to be able to go go out and do it on a regular basis
[02:48:51] and one of the best things about it is you get to see the improvement you get to see teams and again
[02:49:00] it's kind of like when you show up and you see the leadership issues you're having it's like
[02:49:04] you're seeing you know what the future is you know how to fix it and you just go this is going to be fun
[02:49:09] and you get to see these people grow and learn and improve and get better and if they're already good
[02:49:14] you get to see them become awesome if they're not doing great you get to see them improve their
[02:49:17] position and then moving that direction so it's definitely rewarding from that aspect I know you've
[02:49:22] already seen that yeah without it out and you know that book and the lessons and you talked to
[02:49:26] you know the title of the book is how US Navy SEALS LEADN WIN you know I'm top my life is what I learned
[02:49:32] from from top gun in the Marine Corps it just so happens like we said it's exactly the same I have my
[02:49:39] own long list of my personal experiences with those things but I was telling you the day like the
[02:49:44] concepts it's identical and so there's no like big leap in my mind how am I going to get there from
[02:49:50] how am I going to embrace this it's oh yeah oh my god that's exactly what I've been doing for the
[02:49:55] last 23 years only my stories this this and this and this is my view of that so again man it was just
[02:50:00] it was so easy to just see it and go this is this is legit I am I'm I want to I want to I want
[02:50:07] in right now like a slow down like no 100% I don't want I don't want to go look for like this is still
[02:50:12] happening right now yeah it's happening so trying to oversell it a little bit but it was I was all in

[02:52:20] Grand Marquis it's an event about leadership it's tools for leadership it's about understanding
[02:52:29] understanding leadership and getting those reps in and hearing all the different angles that's
[02:52:33] what makes you good at it of course it's live of course there's no backstage there's no
[02:52:40] diva green room that will be hiding in saying bring me some green M&M's for my next set no that's
[02:52:47] not happening we won't be hiding it's going to be all of us together will be learning be
[02:52:53] becoming better leaders we will see you there now as far as this podcast goes echo Charles
[02:53:02] maybe you could present us at this time with some information on sure if anybody does want to
[02:53:08] support this podcast how they could do it yeah small presentation yeah small presentation who is
[02:53:12] that with the green M&M's that thing he said with the green that was somebody right
[02:53:16] somebody be rough it's David Lee Roth and I actually know the story behind this
[02:53:21] there's a reason why he did that they would have a it's called a I forget what it's called
[02:53:26] but when you go to somewhere oh it's called a writer right so you get a contract and the
[02:53:31] contract comes with a writer and says this is the things that we need so what David Lee Roth from
[02:53:36] Van Hayle would do is he would say hey I want you know seven bowls of M&M's with no brown M&M's
[02:53:44] in them or green or whatever I think it was brown but he said no brown M&M's and this sounds
[02:53:51] like a ridiculous request right I mean who would possibly want that blah blah blah blah well
[02:53:55] David Lee Roth did it for reason why do you think he did it can you guess no can you guess
[02:54:01] because check it out think of how simple this is he's doing a concert one night he's doing a
[02:54:05] concert two light later to concert three nights after that so he's on the road hitting these
[02:54:09] concert venues and there's all this stuff that has to be set up and all the stuff that
[02:54:12] lights and sound and sound boards and special effects and ramps and all this stuff's got to be
[02:54:17] set up and it's got to be set up right when he would show up if the seven bowls of M&M's were
[02:54:25] laid out and there's no brown M&M's in him he wouldn't have to go and inspect everything because
[02:54:29] he knew that they were paying attention and if he got there and it wasn't that way he knew
[02:54:36] that these people had an issue with attention detail and so now he had to be go and scrutinize
[02:54:40] and make sure everything wasn't placed the way it was supposed to be. Little lesson learned from
[02:54:44] Bayvenley Roth. This was like a little test. Yeah really. Yeah really.
[02:54:47] Yeah really. A little test M&M's test. Interesting. And by the way that story that I just told
[02:54:54] that may be a hundred percent urban myth but I I know I heard it somebody. I thought I think it's true.
[02:55:02] I'm sure somebody I'm sure our listeners will tell us where that can be referenced. Yeah for some
[02:55:07] reason I thought I thought I thought of somebody else and that's just how they were. Where they're OCD or
[02:55:11] something. I don't know either way. Hey you're so you think about like the reason you were such
[02:55:20] an important asset given your skill set as a forward air control. That's what's called is
[02:55:28] because essentially you have all this expertise while you're in the air and you can bring all that
[02:55:33] brain in eyes to the ground. Yeah that's why you're better than your, yeah. I mean in a
[02:55:39] yes. Absolutely. I didn't really pick up on that till kind of later. I was like dang that's pretty
[02:55:44] advanced. If you think about any aspect I mean it's like if you that's why in the corner of a
[02:55:51] mixed martial arts match oftentimes they'll be a striking coach. They'll be a due to due to coach
[02:55:58] and they'll be a wrestling coach. You know they'll have those specific guys in there and sometimes they'll
[02:56:02] bring a specific guy in to corner like like Dean. Dean has been brought in to corner guys
[02:56:08] that are going against a specific due to two person because they want to get a little
[02:56:12] of that expertise. Same fundamental concept here. Hey when we start with this podcast I need
[02:56:20] it somebody that knew how to press record. Boom. See same thing identical. Yeah. I did it all those
[02:56:29] years of pressing record and then stop and then record again. Yeah. So I'm kind of like good deal echo
[02:56:35] in a way. Yeah. Same thing. Doing the same thing is Dave really. When it comes down to it
[02:56:40] speaking of doing good things. So that was a big like breath like you better say something.
[02:56:51] I'm gonna say a lot. Actually I'm not gonna say a lot actually. Yeah. You know last one I felt like
[02:56:56] I really went deep into the krill oil analogy the night club Omega 3's. Oh tell me that. Yeah.
[02:57:02] You know love of God. I feel like the mess. That was a good analogy. That was a perfect analogy.
[02:57:09] That was excellent. In fact it was so good I wouldn't touch it. That's what I'm saying. You know that
[02:57:14] you can do this too much of a good thing. Anyway if you get a no acrylic oil is it's a little like
[02:57:18] what shrimp things. Baby shrimp. You extract the oil and it's getting good for your joints. The
[02:57:25] Omega 3's and that. The good for your joints. Anyway, in regards to supplementation which
[02:57:30] I'm down for now by the way. I'm a supplement person. Not all supplements. Just the key ones.
[02:57:36] Doing maintenance whatnot. Anyway, getting from on it that's the best ones. Everyone knows that factually.
[02:57:43] So if you want a 10% discount on that go to on it.com slash.com.
[02:57:50] I want to talk about the sodium in the water situation. I got to feel that we're just gonna hear it over here.
[02:57:56] Yeah. So. So while they even I are talking through the podcast are you just over here just
[02:58:03] dreaming up just somewhere you're going with that. When you say echo how can you support? I'm thinking
[02:58:10] dang you days been controlling all this stuff and going to talk to you been doing your stuff and
[02:58:15] I'm watching like sodium in the lake videos. You ever watch those? You're doing what you have to.
[02:58:20] Doing what I'm doing. Yeah. So.
[02:58:26] Anyway, the more I watch those the better analogy I realize it is. You know with the Amazon
[02:58:31] click through things so people want to support the spotcast in an easy way. Click through the website

[02:58:53] URL into their bookmarks. Some people are smart like that. Yeah. Like you just says Amazon.

[03:00:51] I wouldn't consider it crowdsourced idea, but, you know, how crowd demanded. Yeah, you know, I was like,
[03:00:58] hey, that you put this on the shirt, put this on the shirt, make sense, make sense. So we're kind of extrapolated
[03:01:02] all the ideas that I thought were good. Master more of the ideas that I heard from you. You thought were good.
[03:01:09] And boom, there it is. New design. Currently legit. Yeah. Jocquoise store.com. Anyway,
[03:01:17] some cool stuff. Good for, uh, there's stuff for women and rash cards. There's stuff for rash
[03:01:26] cards. No. Hey, that was the interruption of thought. But so like rash cards. We have to
[03:01:32] do some more for Brady after this one. Yeah, no, it's okay. Good. You know how you think of like
[03:01:37] five things at once and they're all like jocking to see which ones are going to come to the next.
[03:01:41] Yeah, that's what happened right there. The rash, the rash card thought came in in one.
[03:01:46] Anyway, I think I'm going to put a new rash card one design out as well. But anyway,
[03:01:52] rash cards, if you want 19% improvement in performance. All aspects of performance. All. Yeah.
[03:01:59] That's mental physical emotional as well. Double blind tested, by the way. Yeah. I think like
[03:02:06] quadruple blind. Yeah. And not blind tested. All that stuff. Psychological warfare. If you're
[03:02:12] having weakness in maintaining unmitigated daily discipline in all things,
[03:02:22] listen to psychological warfare. Yeah. I got, I just got interviewed the other day and it was a,
[03:02:28] the guy, you know, he sent me a blue question, you know, hey, what do you do when you're in a
[03:02:33] situation where you've got, you know, you want to go to the gym or you're, you're supposed to do
[03:02:38] some hard task for workers to some, trying to do something to improve yourself and you, you know,
[03:02:43] the, the mindset comes in where you just, you just don't want to do it. You know, what should
[03:02:48] you think people should do then? Yeah. And I said, do it anyway. Right. And then it was all quiet.
[03:02:56] Because he thinks I'm going to give this big explanation. But there's no big explanation. Yeah.
[03:03:00] The explanation is, oh, the stuff is hard. Yeah. I can't make that thing easier for you. I cannot
[03:03:06] make 20 reps squats any easier for you. I can't do it. They're going to be hard. In fact,
[03:03:12] they're going to suck. And I can't make nothing. I can do is going to make it easier for you.
[03:03:16] You know what you have to do to do it anyways. It's kind of like, I told this to Jade that exact
[03:03:23] situation or that thing that you just said where it's, even if you don't feel like doing it,
[03:03:29] you still want to do it and all this stuff. But your body is like, oh, it's kind of running on
[03:03:33] auto. Like, okay, compare it to like a video camera, right? Where you put the settings on auto and it'll
[03:03:39] it'll adjust with how it's feeling. And that's how it's going to handle any situation. The
[03:03:43] light kind of goes down. It kind of adjusts how it feels, you know, that to deal with this situation.
[03:03:49] So if you're running on auto and you don't feel like dealing head on with this workout, these squats
[03:03:54] you're going to maneuver around it. Just kind of automatically, no, you got to turn it to manual
[03:03:58] manual. You'll be like, I don't care if they're hard squats, easy squats, how what I feel.
[03:04:02] I'm going to do them. This is what we're doing. Yes, exactly. So it's like a manual control.
[03:04:06] Yeah. Just control your own mind. Yes. You've talked about that before. Don't do it on like the
[03:04:09] automate because your body wants to rest. Really? It wants to rest week. Your body wants to rest
[03:04:15] every single day actually. You got to turn it from auto to manual. And you can get information like this
[03:04:21] in psychological warfare on iTunes. The artist's name is Jockel Willing. The artist,
[03:04:29] I never thought that I would be. I thought you had to paint something or sculpt something to be an artist.
[03:04:35] Yeah, I thought that. I think it's. But now I put something on iTunes, then they just know
[03:04:39] you're an artist now. Yeah. Jockel the heart if and I that. Well, I'm going to say they're
[03:04:44] really stretching the words on that. But yeah, man, if you're, you know, if you're
[03:04:48] slipping on the diet, waking up in the morning and you want to hit snooze, maybe postville in the
[03:04:54] workout. And you want how should I say like a spot to switch the dial from automatic to manual?
[03:05:03] That's what it is. So search psychological warfare on iTunes, Jockel Willing. Get after it.
[03:05:09] It's a war on weakness. Yeah, big time. You know, when you're clicking through Amazon,
[03:05:14] by the way, you can get Jockel White Tea there on Amazon. And, you know, when you get it,
[03:05:24] I'm just going to say this, when you get it, you will see. And I'm going to give you one word just
[03:05:31] to kind of what do what you anticipate. Just just think about this deadlift. That's what you're
[03:05:37] going to be. So it's going to come to mind with the Jockel White Tea. It's going to be going up a lot.
[03:05:42] So, and that's by the way, again, quadruple blind double tested that you're going to bring your,
[03:05:49] you know, minimum, what's the lightest? I think the minimum that you're going to get deadlifting
[03:05:53] is 8,000, 8,000 pounds. So get on that. You can also pre-order way the warrior kid. It comes out
[03:05:59] May 2nd. By the way, it just came out on iTunes as one of the most anticipated books of the spring.
[03:06:09] Oh, dang. It got listed. Right. How do you imagine that? Right. Kids book. Now all of a sudden we're
[03:06:16] talking most anticipated book of the spring, which means people are waiting for it and they've ordered
[03:06:21] it. So if you want it, order it now. Now I'm going to tell you, there's some people that are not
[03:06:27] looking forward to this book coming out. They are not anticipating. You know those people are
[03:06:31] bullies. Oh, yeah. Bullies are looking forward to it. I'll tell you who else isn't looking forward to this
[03:06:36] coming out. Donut makers. People that make donuts. You know the gig is up. Weakness. You know
[03:06:44] weakness is like a creature like a creature. Like a creature. Yeah. He's not looking forward to this
[03:06:51] book come out because all those things are going down. All those things are trembling. Make those
[03:06:56] things tremble harder, order, way the warrior kid. For your kid, for your neighbor's kid, and for
[03:07:04] yourself, you will dig it. Also, discipline equals freedom. The field manual is coming out
[03:07:12] October 17th. I know it seems like a long time away, but I'm telling you you should pre-order it now.
[03:07:18] Why? Because when you pre-order it, you will then know that it is coming.
[03:07:26] And when you know it is coming, you will begin to prepare for it mentally and physically for this
[03:07:33] book to arrive on your doorstep. You want to be ready mentally and physically because when you get this
[03:07:39] book, you will have to do certain things. Namely, get after it. Yeah, that one.
[03:07:47] Extreme ownership. Of course, the book, you can get it right now. You know if the weight at all.
[03:07:52] Not just for you, but for your team, your spouse, your boss, your baby, center, your mother-in-law.
[03:07:59] You know she needs a copy of that. She needs it. It takes ownership. So,
[03:08:04] forever, copy, just be gentle with it. You don't have to throw it at her, but maybe just you
[03:08:08] know place it on her desk. So, she can read it because the more people you get in the game and
[03:08:16] start taking ownership of things, the better your life's going to be straight up. Now,
[03:08:20] if that isn't enough of us, you can find us active on the interwebs, Twitter, Instagram,
[03:08:35] and if you're going to look at that Facebook key, we're going to be there as well. Dave is at
[03:08:41] David Burke. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willick. Echo Charles, any closing words?
[03:08:53] I feel like we should talk about the movie top gun a little bit.
[03:08:56] Right? No. Actually, one question, one question. You know how like when you watch top gun, right?
[03:09:01] You of course, Maverick, that's your guy or goose, that's your guy. Did you like iceman?
[03:09:06] Yeah, because he was pretty dope. You know what I'm talking about, all right? Absolutely. Who
[03:09:12] doesn't like iceman? Absolutely. There it is. Yeah. Simple as that. That's your wrong question.
[03:09:19] I'll find a question. Or did you ever buzz the tower? You don't see that never happen. Is that fake?
[03:09:25] Is that like you can't really do that? You can't really do that. You can be in a ton of trouble.
[03:09:29] As they said, you can do anything once. You can do that once and then what you're out. You're out.
[03:09:33] But not if you're maverick. Awesome. Dave, man. Obviously thanks to Tom for coming on. You got
[03:09:42] me up. You got me closing remarks and I'm sure we'll do this again and when you listen to this,
[03:09:46] you'll think of a bunch of stuff that we should have said on this one. But anything else you
[03:09:50] want to wrap it up with for today? Yeah, man. First, thanks. This was awesome. I've been thinking
[03:09:55] about this for a couple of weeks. And we've been talking about it. I was super fired up to be here.
[03:09:59] And this was awesome. You know, we were talking about it just briefly. And I mentioned it.
[03:10:05] You know, my life obviously, I talked about the things that they went through.
[03:10:11] So my life and my mom, you know, this is my family and those are folks that endure to whatever
[03:10:15] degree that when you're removed, I think when you're on deployment, you do this stuff. It's hard.
[03:10:19] But it's actually in some ways, harder for the people that you leave behind because they don't
[03:10:23] know what's going on. They're just waiting and wondering and dealing with it and they're kind of
[03:10:27] holding their breath. I remember a story that Whitney told me when I was deployed, I didn't think
[03:10:32] about any of this stuff. A buddy of Niels had come to the house. He was gone. And he couldn't get
[03:10:38] in the house. And he was knocking on the window, which was by the front of the house and kind of
[03:10:43] ringing the doorbell. And it was a late night, like not a time that somebody should be at the door.
[03:10:49] And she didn't want to answer the door. And she's telling me, and this stuff, you don't think
[03:10:52] about that stuff. And you get back in here, the stories because you don't really think about what
[03:10:56] your family's going through because you're busy and you're doing your thing. And she talked about
[03:11:01] the thing that she hated the most was people knocking on the door because she was always just
[03:11:04] sort of a tiny bit paranoid that it was going to be somebody coming to tell her about me.
[03:11:12] You know, Chris's mom Kathy Leon who's someone I don't even have the words to describe how much I
[03:11:18] love her and admire her. And it's not just about her loss. She obviously, she had to answer that call.
[03:11:24] Well, you know, she had to take that call on June 20th, 2006. She took that phone call. But
[03:11:30] that woman has endured the loss of a million who sacrificed herself on behalf of the entire
[03:11:36] country. And my relationship, the irony in all this is that I would not, I would not have a relationship
[03:11:42] with Kathy. And Chris wasn't killed. And I would give anything to take that day back and bring her
[03:11:48] him home. I would trade any of it. But the goodness that comes out of that, there's always, there
[03:11:55] is always some goodness. If you look for hard enough that comes out of all this stuff and the loss
[03:12:01] and the things that you sacrifice. And I know Kathy is certainly listening and I never anticipated
[03:12:07] having a relationship with someone like that based on those circumstances. But my relationship whether
[03:12:12] it is really important. And what she is done for the country is really important. And if you look
[03:12:17] hard enough in the worst situations, you find something that's good. And my relationship with her
[03:12:22] is really good. And I would really, it would be wrong for me to go through this whole podcast and
[03:12:27] talking to all those things without acknowledging that goodness with her. So I wanted to mention that.
[03:12:36] Well, Dave, obviously, thanks for coming on. I know we've been talking about this for a while.
[03:12:44] And it's great to have you on. And thanks for sharing your story with us, the story of you,
[03:12:53] a marine fighter pilot, a forwarder controller, but also a son, a brother, a father, a person.
[03:13:12] And yeah, thanks for sharing the story of Corporal Chris Leon, a marine no doubt.
[03:13:26] A hero without question. But let us remember, let us always remember that these men,
[03:13:44] these men, we call warriors, these men we call soldiers, these men we call marines,
[03:13:55] these men we call heroes. But us never forget that they're people.
[03:14:06] Suns and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, let us not forget that they're,
[03:14:21] they're not only courageous, vigilant and bold and aggressive and inspiring,
[03:14:29] but they're also funny and outrageous and flawed like any of us,
[03:14:43] then that they're loving and loved, then that they're people,
[03:14:54] people who left behind people, and those that are left behind, never forget,
[03:15:07] like Chris Leon's mom Kathy Leon, who wrote, but note on his memorial page back in 2008.
[03:15:24] And she said, hi baby, another difficult day to face without you here.
[03:15:38] I never thought that memorial day would be in memory of you,
[03:15:44] my dear sweet, beautiful sun. It's been one year, 11 months and five days,
[03:15:59] so close to two years, then I cannot bear the thought.
[03:16:04] We honor you by flying the flag every day and we will place
[03:16:15] your American heroes tribute banner for all to see tomorrow.
[03:16:19] Of course, we will cry more tears and maybe find a smile or laugh as we remember your deep voice,
[03:16:34] great smile, joking sense of humor and the love you showed to us.
[03:16:48] Our hearts are forever empty and broken without you.
[03:16:57] Miss you so much and love you more.
[03:17:00] All our love, moment had.
[03:17:07] Remember, remember, major Henry L. Rodden,
[03:17:29] remember, corporal Christopher Leon, remember those like them who have fallen.
[03:17:42] Remember them as warriors, remember them as heroes, but always, always remember them,
[03:18:03] as people. Remember them.
[03:18:14] Until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel out.
