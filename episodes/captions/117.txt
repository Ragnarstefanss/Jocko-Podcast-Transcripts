00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.64 This is Jockel podcast number 117 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:12.88 And we're doing a Q&A tonight first one in a while.
00:00:12.88 --> 00:00:19.92 I've had a bunch of other guests and books and whatnot. So Q&A. Let's go.
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:26.76 Cool. First question. Jockel from 115 podcast number 115 as a leader.
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:33.000 How best to respond to someone like Corporal Meyer when he brings up good questions in a brief
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.44 that need to be addressed without derailing the brief and calling your
00:00:37.44 --> 00:00:40.92 Competence slash authority into question.
00:00:40.92 --> 00:00:47.32 Okay. So what he's talking about is on podcast 115 with Dakota Meyer, which if you haven't
00:00:47.32 --> 00:00:54.04 listened to it, listen to it. It's long and it's very, I don't know. It's it's awesome.
00:00:54.04 --> 00:01:01.40 Anyways, it part of that podcast Dakota is getting told how they're going to conduct this
00:01:01.40 --> 00:01:05.08 operation and Dakota raises some point and says, what about this, what about that, and
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:10.84 what about this other thing? And they don't listen to it. And so the question here is, if
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:15.24 you're in charge, you're the leader and you get someone that brings up these questions
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:20.68 during a brief during the plan that you need to be that need to be addressed. How do you do
00:01:20.68 --> 00:01:26.04 it? How do you handle that, probably? Okay. Well, first of all, and the most important part of this,
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:30.68 is if you involve your team in the planning itself, you won't have these questions come up
00:01:30.68 --> 00:01:36.28 during the brief. They'll come up during the planning. So that's the ultimate and best way to
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:40.92 solve this problem. You don't plan in a vacuum as the leader and then present the plan to the
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:45.000 troops and expect that you're going to have the perfect plan. You did, it was only your brain
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000 working on it. What about everyone else's brain? What about everyone else's perspective? They have
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.84 experience and they have knowledge that you don't have. So if you involve them in the planning,
00:01:54.84 --> 00:01:59.72 then they ask you those questions early and you figure out what the rights answers to those questions
00:01:59.72 --> 00:02:06.36 are. So that's how you solve the problem right there. Now, if it happens that for whatever reason
00:02:06.36 --> 00:02:10.60 you didn't have the opportunity to do that or you didn't do it well enough for whatever the case
00:02:10.60 --> 00:02:17.32 may be. And now you start getting questions on your plan while you're briefing. Well, first of all,
00:02:17.32 --> 00:02:24.44 if they ask you questions that you don't have answers to, then that could indicate that you're wrong
00:02:24.44 --> 00:02:31.80 actually. You could actually be wrong and not a lot of leaders like to feel that way, but you should
00:02:31.80 --> 00:02:36.20 actually be happy that someone on your team is pointing out something that is going to make the plan
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:43.32 better as a whole. So there's that and it's really easy. If someone, if you're in a brief and someone
00:02:43.32 --> 00:02:47.96 brings up a point that you didn't think of and it makes sense, well, then you can implement that
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:57.24 into the plan. Okay, so that now you might think that it hurts your authority. Right to say,
00:02:57.24 --> 00:03:02.20 hey, that's a good point, Echo. I didn't think of that. Let's implement. You might think or feel like
00:03:02.20 --> 00:03:06.52 that's going to make you look bad, but the opposite is actually true. If I go no Echo,
00:03:06.52 --> 00:03:10.52 hey, the plan's already completed. You weren't there for the planning, so just be quiet. That's the
00:03:10.52 --> 00:03:15.96 guy that no one respects. That's the guy that's not looking good as a leader. That's the person that's
00:03:15.96 --> 00:03:19.32 losing authority. So you don't look weak if you listen to members of the team, whether they're
00:03:19.32 --> 00:03:28.92 junior or senior. It also shows that you're incompetent if you because you miss the part, obviously
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:33.88 the question is pertinent that they asked or I should say if the question is pertinent and it is a
00:03:33.88 --> 00:03:42.68 good point that it shows that you miss an important angle of the plan. So open your mind, open your
00:03:42.68 --> 00:03:48.76 put your ego in check and incorporate it in there. Now, this can also happen. If there's something
00:03:48.76 --> 00:03:54.76 that you know that you're right on, but something that you know that you're right on. If there's
00:03:54.76 --> 00:04:00.12 something like that and you and this, you know, maybe you get one particular individual that's
00:04:00.12 --> 00:04:06.84 keeps pushing back and keeps pushing back and you might have to in those cases say, you know what?
00:04:06.84 --> 00:04:11.64 Hey, Echo, let me talk to you after this brief is over and I'll explain to you exactly what we're doing
00:04:11.64 --> 00:04:16.52 it this way. So that way doesn't derail the brief because it might take a longer explanation than you
00:04:16.52 --> 00:04:22.76 want to, you know, for instance, the typical seal briefing was we try to keep it 50 minutes to an hour.
00:04:22.76 --> 00:04:28.12 So if you're got to spend eight minutes pulling up a different map and explaining some detail of
00:04:28.12 --> 00:04:32.28 the terrain to this guy that has a protest to what you're saying, you might say, hey, listen,
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:35.72 when you get done with this brief, I'll pull you side. Let me show you the terrain map and you can
00:04:35.72 --> 00:04:42.52 see exactly why we're using this insertion router. Whatever the case may be. So you can do that if you have to
00:04:43.16 --> 00:04:46.84 and even then they might end up having a point that you didn't see and then you can say, okay,
00:04:46.84 --> 00:04:52.20 well, I didn't see that. Now we have to give everyone a quick, a rebreafing on some change in the
00:04:52.20 --> 00:04:58.36 plan. But again, none of this will happen if you bring your subordinates in and you let them
00:04:59.96 --> 00:05:04.28 first of all, let them do the planning. That's ideal. Let them come up with plan. I let echo come up with
00:05:04.28 --> 00:05:07.80 the plan. I'm not coming up with the plan. You go come up with the plan. I'm going to check with you and
00:05:07.80 --> 00:05:11.32 make sure that the plan is going in the right direction. Make sure it's not totally off track.
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:17.56 And then you'll incorporate all these things and I'll have a better view of the plan. I can
00:05:17.56 --> 00:05:21.48 stand back and be the tactical genius as we talk about the book history of ownership. Like that's
00:05:21.48 --> 00:05:31.72 how you do it. So that's the answer. Well, at least is an answer. Yeah. Maybe other people have other
00:05:31.72 --> 00:05:37.64 answers. Seems to make sense to me. Yeah, that's that hard. It's hard, right? When you, when you,
00:05:38.60 --> 00:05:42.92 it's one of the things you always got to be conscious of when you have a plan or whatever. And
00:05:44.28 --> 00:05:49.000 someone for lack of better term poke souls in it. And be like, hey, what about this? What about this?
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.80 And then you have those two elements that you got to keep in mind where it's like the fact that
00:05:53.80 --> 00:05:58.28 it's your plan and then the plan, you know, the effectiveness of your emotional attachment to the
00:05:58.28 --> 00:06:02.68 plan. Yeah. Yeah. You got to keep the emotional attachment to the plan. In Jack versus the
00:06:03.56 --> 00:06:07.72 actual effectiveness of the plan. Yeah. And people have a hard time doing that. And what's cool.
00:06:07.72 --> 00:06:12.44 What's cool is once you break away from that mindset, then it's really easy. Yeah. Just to be
00:06:12.44 --> 00:06:16.20 and everyone just kind of knows. Oh, yeah. Jockels. He's got an overmind. It wasn't to
00:06:16.20 --> 00:06:21.000 get as opposed to someone that has a closed mind, everyone goes, oh, you can't, you can't get anything
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.48 by this guy. Yeah. You just, he's going to keep. He doesn't even help to point things out because
00:06:25.48 --> 00:06:31.24 he won't listen. And then guess what? You're using one brain versus 20 brains. And more important
00:06:31.24 --> 00:06:35.56 than the brain power, the perspective, the different perspective. Because the guys in the ground,
00:06:35.56 --> 00:06:39.16 the guys with the technical knowledge and the tactical knowledge, they're going to know things
00:06:39.16 --> 00:06:46.04 that you don't know. That's the way it is. You can't know everything that they know. And so if you
00:06:46.04 --> 00:06:50.52 shut down all those different perspectives, you're looking at something from one angle. You know.
00:06:50.52 --> 00:06:54.60 Do you see the whole complete picture when you only look at something from one angle? No, you don't
00:06:54.60 --> 00:07:02.04 know, sir. Use those other perspectives. You know, check self-correcting machine. Yeah.
00:07:02.04 --> 00:07:07.16 You can let go of the ego, the taking it personal. Well, personal. When I was in the seal
00:07:07.16 --> 00:07:10.84 teams, I called it the emotional attachment to the plan. Yeah. Because I see these people come up with
00:07:10.84 --> 00:07:15.16 plans and they would be so addicted to their own plan, only because it was their own plan. Not for
00:07:15.16 --> 00:07:19.48 any, not for any tactical strategic or operational reason whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. They just like
00:07:19.48 --> 00:07:24.84 the because they thought of it. Yeah. That's natural. Yeah. It's very natural. Yeah. And there's some
00:07:24.84 --> 00:07:30.36 element of benefit to that, right? Because if you're passionate about your plan and I'm passionate
00:07:30.36 --> 00:07:36.20 about my plan as long as we can eventually come to compromise, then we've put forth the best idea.
00:07:36.20 --> 00:07:39.48 Because I don't want you to not be passionate about your plan while you're planning it. I want you
00:07:39.48 --> 00:07:43.72 really to come up with the best plan that you really believe in. And it's interesting. You know,
00:07:43.72 --> 00:07:48.76 you talk about poking holes, right? Poking holes in the plan. And we all know that it's very
00:07:48.76 --> 00:07:54.76 easy to sit back and poke holes. Oh, yeah. And what I'm telling you to do as a leader is to absolutely
00:07:54.76 --> 00:08:00.20 do that. Not be a jerk. No, no, and I'm talking as a leader. If I, if I let you do the planning,
00:08:00.20 --> 00:08:04.60 then it's easy for me to sit back and poke holes in the plan, which is good. It's good because
00:08:04.60 --> 00:08:07.72 we're going to come up with, we're going to fill those holes. Once I poke the holes, we're going
00:08:07.72 --> 00:08:11.64 to fill them. They're going to know that they're taking care of. Also, as a leader from a,
00:08:11.64 --> 00:08:16.76 from a perspective point, you think, hey, Jockle really knows what's going on. He was able to
00:08:16.76 --> 00:08:22.12 find these holes in the plan. The real reason I was able to find him is just because I was not totally
00:08:23.96 --> 00:08:31.24 at at minuscule detail with the plan. You were, I was up at altitude relaxing looking around.
00:08:31.24 --> 00:08:36.52 Yeah, it's kind of, I don't want to say cheating. But you know, cheating. Yeah, it's cheating.
00:08:36.52 --> 00:08:40.76 You're cheating. It's that much easier. It's so much easier to sit back and do it.
00:08:40.76 --> 00:08:44.84 Yeah, and let things go that way. Like when you know when you watch a movie and you have like
00:08:44.84 --> 00:08:49.72 some critique, the movies outstanding and then you have some critique, I had to show that guy for
00:08:49.72 --> 00:08:54.44 that role or whatever. Meanwhile, the movies like ground breaking, whatever. You know, so it's easy
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:00.04 to poke holes in the movie. Meanwhile, like, yeah, when it's done, you're all like poking holes
00:09:00.04 --> 00:09:05.40 up the little imperfections. Do that all the time. Make sense. They dig it. Is that happening with your
00:09:05.40 --> 00:09:16.76 videos? Is that what they're saying? Probably. In your way. Next question. We have been training
00:09:16.76 --> 00:09:23.16 due to for two months now. We started actually rolling a few weeks ago for my knees on the
00:09:23.16 --> 00:09:30.60 mat, like not starting from standing. I've trained for an executed multi, oh, I've trained for
00:09:30.60 --> 00:09:35.88 and executed multiple marathons, competed, completed a number of tough motors, trained hard and
00:09:35.88 --> 00:09:41.48 crossfit, hiked, biked, so I am. And nothing compares to the total mental and physical exhaustion.
00:09:41.48 --> 00:09:50.28 I feel after training due to it's how can I combat this? Time. Train more supplements. Just suck it up.
00:09:51.56 --> 00:09:55.32 When I get home, I'm so beat in the next morning. I wake up feeling like I was hit by a boss.
00:09:55.32 --> 00:10:00.44 I'm dying on that feeling. This might be exhaustion and still sucking at it. It's
00:10:00.44 --> 00:10:08.04 super fun. Okay. So that's the GG2. That's it. Okay. So there's a couple of things here. Yes, it's going
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:12.28 to take some time. You're going to have to train. You train more. Your body will become condition to it.
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:19.48 That's probably number one. Number two is, and this is so hard for people to do. Relax.
00:10:20.28 --> 00:10:24.84 It's really hard. It's really hard for people to do, especially when you first start out.
00:10:24.84 --> 00:10:30.76 I realize that the way you get to a point when you start to relax
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:39.32 is when the capability of your technique surpasses the capability of your strength.
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:44.04 So if I know that I can escape your
00:10:45.80 --> 00:10:52.76 choke attempt by holding your hand and pulling your thumb and pulling your arm off, and that's what I know.
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:58.36 That's what I'm going to do. When I realize that I can use a technical escape of swimming my
00:10:58.36 --> 00:11:02.76 arm in and then placing my hips on the ground and then scooting away from your choke,
00:11:02.76 --> 00:11:09.72 I'll do that instead. But until we figure out the techniques, all we have is muscle. So
00:11:10.28 --> 00:11:17.40 the way you do is you just have to keep training and you can train. Can people actually when they
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:23.24 try and relax do they actually get you tell me. So I always tell people like relax more. Like
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:33.40 someone will say I just can't relax. I'll be like relax harder. But it's so hard for people to
00:11:33.40 --> 00:11:38.76 relax because people say oh when I relax I just get submitted. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So but if you
00:11:38.76 --> 00:11:44.36 relax you'll at least be aware of what's happening. And if you relax you can think about the
00:11:44.36 --> 00:11:54.04 technical movement that you're supposed to do to escape. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like just like how you
00:11:54.04 --> 00:12:00.28 sit though. If you don't know the move you're just going to go with what you know and it's going to
00:12:00.28 --> 00:12:06.04 be the spas in one way or another. If you if you guys on you it's like a never effective.
00:12:07.80 --> 00:12:13.48 Because I'll I'll go and say yes. Yes. Sometimes I have to spas and it Dean calls me out on that
00:12:13.48 --> 00:12:17.16 a lot. Well here's the thing. You're a good defense. You're just spashing. Well but you're spashing.
00:12:17.16 --> 00:12:23.32 There has a big more than a sprinkle of technique and that's the thing. If true. Like you
00:12:23.32 --> 00:12:26.68 and I told you this one time you know how like if you say yeah you're strong and that's kind of an
00:12:26.68 --> 00:12:30.92 insult in due to because like saying yeah you're strong but you don't have technique it's kind of like
00:12:30.92 --> 00:12:34.92 that's what you're in playing. But and I said this to you one time I was like you have like strength
00:12:34.92 --> 00:12:41.08 you're strong and you were like not defensive but you were like no I have technique or whatever and
00:12:41.08 --> 00:12:46.76 I was like yeah I know that I was like shoot that sounded bad. I mean you have technique. We
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:51.40 already know that. You've been training for 25 million years and you have good technique but with
00:12:51.40 --> 00:12:57.32 that technique is like a lot of strength in there. Like when you um there's like stuff oh yeah
00:12:57.32 --> 00:13:02.68 when like if you if all be inside control on on top on you and you have this like first of your
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:08.20 hands are in the correct spot just to be in with. That's to be and you can just kind of get your
00:13:08.20 --> 00:13:14.28 leg and real easy every single time. Like I can't stop it stop it and I'm not weak. I'm not weak
00:13:14.28 --> 00:13:19.24 but it's like the strength of that move is it. It's unstoppable and that's what I said it. I was like
00:13:19.24 --> 00:13:24.04 you're like strong when you do a technique it's like it's a strong technique. Yeah and I would say
00:13:24.04 --> 00:13:30.68 though there's a lot of oh I would say it's probably 70% technique and 30% strength. Which which may
00:13:30.68 --> 00:13:37.32 confirm what you're saying. That 30% strength is still more than if someone has 70% technique
00:13:37.32 --> 00:13:44.12 but they have only 10% strength to get back it up. Yeah fully and even saying it's you know
00:13:44.12 --> 00:13:50.20 70% technique 30% strength. I mean that's going to vary from time from moment to moment or experience
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:55.24 history. So if you're spashing even that's going to be a spectrum like how much strength
00:13:55.24 --> 00:13:58.68 do you use this technique kind of thing? That's because you can't spell for a long time. No
00:13:58.68 --> 00:14:03.48 you can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. Yeah. So when I say you're strong
00:14:03.48 --> 00:14:07.40 here's the thing the fact is you're strong regardless of your your technique or not you can live a lot
00:14:07.40 --> 00:14:13.08 of ways your big trigrab like I'll grab your wrist and when you break the grip of the wrist it's
00:14:13.08 --> 00:14:18.52 way more violent than the typical person. You're strong person. So there's no denying that I know it
00:14:18.52 --> 00:14:24.36 sounds like an insult to it but nonetheless back to the point. Yeah so if you if you have strength
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:28.84 going in before you gain all that technique over the or the years just like how you said that's
00:14:28.84 --> 00:14:37.24 what you're going to use. So the key is here I think is to consciously and it's not easy.
00:14:37.24 --> 00:14:41.64 Consciously focus on the technique. Consciously like remember okay where am I? I mean half guard right
00:14:41.64 --> 00:14:45.64 now because you know all like in the beginning when you first learn the the positions you're like
00:14:45.64 --> 00:14:50.44 half guard is real clear guard is real clear. When you start rolling around your halfway upside down
00:14:50.44 --> 00:14:55.24 maybe your twisting maybe your arms in the wrong spot across your body so like you kind of don't
00:14:55.24 --> 00:15:01.08 remember oh wait I'm in half guard right now or I'm upside down but I'm in you know I'm on his back
00:15:01.08 --> 00:15:07.48 still or whatever so you don't it doesn't just stick in your mind what position you're in but if you can
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:12.12 do that then it starts getting getting routine so now after that you can figure out okay my
00:15:12.12 --> 00:15:16.92 safe here because that's why you spas that's why you you can't relax because you don't know if you're
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:21.56 safe or not so you're just trying to move and get out of there or you know get that's a mission
00:15:21.56 --> 00:15:26.60 hurry up before he does something you know where the supplies to life this applies to life
00:15:26.60 --> 00:15:33.56 in when you're interacting with other people and you start to let's say you and I are having
00:15:33.56 --> 00:15:39.80 a disagreement about something right and you start getting the upper hand on me
00:15:40.68 --> 00:15:46.76 and instead of me trying to use a technique to get out all I do is go let's do Brideco you're
00:15:46.76 --> 00:15:51.40 done or something right I just are interrupting you're cutting off raising my voice I'm actually losing
00:15:51.40 --> 00:16:00.36 now and I don't you know but I'm relying on brute force as opposed to technique now it could
00:16:00.36 --> 00:16:06.12 be also like we talked about earlier could be that I'm wrong and if instead of admitting that I'm wrong
00:16:06.12 --> 00:16:11.16 or or taking like you're saying relax and looking at the technique and saying you know what echo
00:16:11.16 --> 00:16:17.48 has a point here that I can't debate against he's right and I'm wrong I need to admit that same
00:16:17.48 --> 00:16:21.64 thing if you came up with an idea for the plan and your idea was better than mine or you had
00:16:21.64 --> 00:16:28.20 a point that I needed to bring into the plan unless I unless I can relax and actually pay attention
00:16:28.20 --> 00:16:33.16 then I'm not going to be able to do that so that's how well that's one of the many ways when I
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:39.000 always talk about GJ2 applying to life this is another example of where hey if the argument starts
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.20 to escalate and you're using brute force to get out of it you're not winning just like you're not
00:16:44.20 --> 00:16:50.76 winning in GJ2 it's you're gonna gas out you're gonna lose yeah don't use brute force yeah
00:16:51.56 --> 00:16:57.64 yeah not even 30% well maybe sometimes 30% okay the other thing is the other thing that's hard
00:16:57.64 --> 00:17:04.12 and it's well it's it's attached to what you're saying don't have death matches every time
00:17:04.12 --> 00:17:09.48 yeah right don't it like you find a partner and just be like okay let's try and make sure that
00:17:09.48 --> 00:17:16.36 we're not using so much strength I can roll with you or with Dean or with Andy or whoever
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.60 for a long time and it's you know we're sweating or tired but we're not using all this strength
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:29.48 we're not walking off the mat with a with with a burned-out muscles yeah it's a different it's more
00:17:29.48 --> 00:17:35.56 of a cardio I would say then then a strength thing when you get to a higher level because you're
00:17:35.56 --> 00:17:39.56 you're just movement it's movement that's happening you know when to you know when someone's
00:17:39.56 --> 00:17:44.04 gonna accomplish something and if you're gonna fight it with muscle you're gonna you're gonna
00:17:44.04 --> 00:17:49.32 end up losing yeah and it goes back to the time thing where how does that seem to be
00:17:49.32 --> 00:17:54.36 is it more time and the answer is yeah it's more time because like you you learn that and again like
00:17:54.36 --> 00:17:59.40 where knowing where to be and where not to be where you're safe and where you're not safe
00:17:59.40 --> 00:18:04.04 or in your jutsu is a big deal so you know how like okay let's say and I know this with you because
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:09.56 let's say if I pass your guard sorry you let me pass your guard I don't know you don't
00:18:09.56 --> 00:18:14.04 spaz and like you know like an tournament where the guys like really trying hard not to let you
00:18:14.04 --> 00:18:19.64 settle in guard and so that's a different scenario of course but you never do that you it's like
00:18:19.64 --> 00:18:23.24 you get to a point pass your guard once you kind of get there you just you settle and you're
00:18:23.24 --> 00:18:30.20 kind of relaxing because you it seems like anyway that you know you're not in danger for a submission
00:18:30.20 --> 00:18:34.92 so that's kind of really where the focus is it's it's not the fact that ooh he passed my guard
00:18:34.92 --> 00:18:40.04 oh no that's terrible it's not that it's okay now what technique do you need to implement to keep
00:18:40.04 --> 00:18:44.44 myself safe and the more you know about the jutsu the more you realize it doesn't take a huge amount
00:18:44.44 --> 00:18:49.40 of energy to to implement that technique it's usually just like an arm position make sure his
00:18:49.40 --> 00:18:53.40 hip is like over there and not over here and that's kind of that's it that's pretty much it
00:18:53.40 --> 00:18:57.88 but if you don't know that you're like oh man you're using your whole body to get out of there
00:18:57.88 --> 00:19:03.08 kind of thing and that's that's where you're leaving no reserves in a military perspective
00:19:03.08 --> 00:19:06.84 in a military you're always supposed to keep your reserves as long as you can oh yeah you're just
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:11.48 you then all reserves trying to spaz out and get out of a dominant position you're also attacking
00:19:11.48 --> 00:19:16.76 a dominant position when you're spazzing to try and get out you're you're just going crazy trying
00:19:16.76 --> 00:19:21.000 to get out of this confirmed position I mean across the side or the mount those are positions that are
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.12 really sure there's a transitional time when you should definitely spaz to try and get out once that's
00:19:26.12 --> 00:19:32.52 surpassed well now you're just you're just expanding energy yeah so defense learning check your diet
00:19:32.52 --> 00:19:36.36 too if you're like really sore and everything make sure you're getting enough protein make sure
00:19:36.36 --> 00:19:40.76 you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting maybe get some uh get some superkrill or some
00:19:40.76 --> 00:19:48.44 or some joint warfare or both because you your body needs it so just other things to try and
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:55.88 put off that soreness in the pain yeah all right yeah well that twisting yeah there's definitely
00:19:55.88 --> 00:20:01.08 you know well yeah it's hard under joints yeah yeah hard yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:20:01.08 --> 00:20:05.40 yeah they get a workout you know they get a workout that you won't be getting doing other stuff
00:20:05.40 --> 00:20:08.92 unless yeah you know construction or something you know something like that same thing you're
00:20:08.92 --> 00:20:15.16 gonna get joint stuff that's how but yeah keep it supposed to be fun the death matches though
00:20:15.16 --> 00:20:23.56 death matches yeah white belt death matches yeah probably um i would estimate 40% of all
00:20:23.56 --> 00:20:27.72 injuries in Gjitsu come from white belt death matches is that you think that's a good number
00:20:27.72 --> 00:20:33.000 yeah if not higher yeah full on yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.40 check okay next question you talk about you talk about empathy and perspective
00:20:41.40 --> 00:20:46.36 and building relationships as a leader but i look at leader a leader like Steve Jobs
00:20:46.36 --> 00:20:51.80 who's known for his hostile attitude toward people isn't that being de-falte aggressive like you
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:57.80 talk about if i'm more naturally that type of leader should i go with it if it worked for Steve
00:20:57.80 --> 00:21:06.76 Jobs shouldn't it work for me so that's a good question and i haven't actually read the book
00:21:06.76 --> 00:21:10.44 about Steve Jobs and i think there's probably more than one but there's one that's real popular
00:21:10.44 --> 00:21:14.20 real thick and someone gave it to me and i have it and i will someday but i haven't read it yet
00:21:14.20 --> 00:21:20.92 and i've heard it's really good and all that and i that being said i've i've heard the same
00:21:20.92 --> 00:21:26.84 things about you know Steve Jobs at leadership style he was real tyrannical and i pulled a
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:34.68 couple things here just from well here we go in his book about jobs time at next and returned
00:21:34.68 --> 00:21:42.52 apple the second coming of Steve Jobs Allen dogeman described jobs rough treatment of his
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:48.52 underlings he would praise is the quote he would praise and inspire them often in very creative ways
00:21:48.52 --> 00:21:57.40 but he would also resort to intimidating goding berating belittle belittling and even accumulating them so
00:21:57.40 --> 00:22:05.88 and there's another article by Ronald regio who's a PhD in psychology and the article came from
00:22:05.88 --> 00:22:13.48 psychology today and it says he was obsessively controlling and given to fits of rage throwing
00:22:13.48 --> 00:22:18.76 tantrums and yelling at employees and board members he could tear down someone's ideas or the
00:22:18.76 --> 00:22:26.44 person himself in a public display some of said he took credit for others ideas and his confidence
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:36.12 led to a sort of over the top arrogance so the guys kind of tyrannical one time when they were
00:22:36.12 --> 00:22:41.48 putting together the mobile me application and it wasn't working well and jobs told the team that
00:22:41.48 --> 00:22:46.68 was putting it together you when it wasn't working you've tarnished apples reputation you should
00:22:46.68 --> 00:22:55.40 hate each other for having let each other down so okay so first of all let's look at the fact
00:22:55.40 --> 00:22:59.64 and you've heard me say this before that people's strengths are their weaknesses and their
00:22:59.64 --> 00:23:06.52 weaknesses can be their strengths so in Steve Jobs case obviously some of this stuff some of his
00:23:06.52 --> 00:23:10.28 weaknesses that we're talking about here were also strengths because he was totally beyond driven
00:23:10.28 --> 00:23:17.80 right he was completely obsessed with doing good and all that and and he pressed toward his vision
00:23:17.80 --> 00:23:23.72 extremely hard he was relentless in trying to make things happen and again those are very positive
00:23:23.72 --> 00:23:27.16 characteristics if you got someone that's really driven and they're driven to the point of almost
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:33.48 being obsessed and you you take that and those are kind of good characteristics but when they go to
00:23:33.48 --> 00:23:38.60 far this is why it's dichotomous the balance of leadership right when when you go to far you become a
00:23:38.60 --> 00:23:43.56 tyrannical leader which is not good it's not good for a team and it's and it's an a team that is
00:23:43.56 --> 00:23:51.64 subjected to that kind of attitude will not perform as well as a unified team period period
00:23:53.24 --> 00:24:02.12 so the guy was clearly hostile and at the same time clearly he was one of the most successful
00:24:02.12 --> 00:24:08.84 business leaders in history right so would you look at him and say okay well maybe I should be that
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:16.84 way maybe I should be a tyrannical leader and I would say to that no you do not get to do that and here's why
00:24:16.84 --> 00:24:24.60 let's look at some other characteristics that Steve Jobs had first of all he was perhaps the
00:24:24.60 --> 00:24:35.08 foremost technological visionary in the history of the world right I mean he had a vision of technology
00:24:35.08 --> 00:24:40.44 that very few people in the history in the world of had and I will go a little bit more narrow I
00:24:40.44 --> 00:24:46.28 think he understood things on another level when it came to technology that the part of how
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:52.12 human beings would interact with technology that's the part that I think he really had
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:58.04 just incredible vision for he realized like oh these people who want to compete in their house
00:24:58.04 --> 00:25:03.16 and they want to reflect the way they live and they're going to want music in their pocket they're
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:07.000 going to want all of their music in their pocket and they're going to want a phone that can do
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.12 you know he had this vision of how people would interact with technology that I don't think too many
00:25:12.12 --> 00:25:20.28 people had so so that's number one number two he had a phenomenal feel for design
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:30.36 right for design and how to merge form and function together in in an aesthetically pleasing
00:25:30.36 --> 00:25:35.88 and and oftentimes stunning way right if you look at the design and that's on common especially
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:42.28 for someone to have that feel for design and still have a massively technical background right
00:25:42.84 --> 00:25:48.92 so so that again we're we're we're making a person that's like 1% of 1% of 1% already
00:25:48.92 --> 00:25:55.80 on top of that he got into business his business at the right time in the right place he had the right
00:25:55.80 --> 00:26:04.52 background on top of that the guy could speak well the guy was very articulate right he was very
00:26:04.52 --> 00:26:09.48 articulate with his vision if you if you watch his keynote speeches that he would give at the
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:14.84 whatever it is when they have the Apple convention what's that thing called the Apple Command
00:26:14.84 --> 00:26:19.24 they have that thing we get up on stage and he talk about stuff and he would articulate that
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:25.72 and he would do it with real clarity and he was very convincing and he was very captivating
00:26:25.72 --> 00:26:31.24 and people were you know they'd say Apple's a cult they'd follow that guy so he had
00:26:32.36 --> 00:26:37.72 all those skills those world class skills and I'm not using that term lately I'm talking
00:26:37.72 --> 00:26:44.12 world class skills and then they're all those world class skills are combined together into
00:26:44.12 --> 00:26:50.28 one package one human being and there you got you got Steve Jobs so he's got all those advantages
00:26:50.28 --> 00:26:55.96 and then on top of that he's had some luck along the way right yet some luck in his timing
00:26:55.96 --> 00:27:02.60 and just upbringing and and the exposures that he got and being exposed to computer programming
00:27:02.60 --> 00:27:09.16 and those things back in the day was rare and he got lucky and having that unfold from so he had
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:18.44 all these things going for him that helped propel him and his company to the top so now if you're
00:27:18.44 --> 00:27:25.000 thinking maybe you should use his leadership style the the the questions that you should ask yourself
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000 is are you all one in a billion technological visionary or visionary of any kind
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.68 the answer that is likely no and if you think it's yes maybe you should check your ego a little bit
00:27:39.72 --> 00:27:46.44 then you have to ask yourself do you have an eye for design on artistic eye for design like
00:27:46.44 --> 00:27:53.56 like divinci or Michelangelo if you have that you you you probably don't if you think you have
00:27:53.56 --> 00:28:00.52 that maybe you should check his ego again are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey
00:28:00.52 --> 00:28:09.24 your vision with total clarity to big giant groups broad groups of people and if you think you can
00:28:09.24 --> 00:28:16.52 do that again you should check your ego can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck
00:28:17.48 --> 00:28:23.88 to to close the gaps in some of those other areas so if you could do all those things if you
00:28:23.88 --> 00:28:31.000 answered yes 100% to all those questions and okay maybe you can get away with being a kind of
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.20 leader that Steve Jobs was but if you're a normal person if you're a normal human being then
00:28:38.20 --> 00:28:43.80 maybe you should try and be a good leader and maybe you should be a leader that build relationships
00:28:43.80 --> 00:28:49.64 and forms cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite the
00:28:49.64 --> 00:29:00.76 ups and downs of whatever business you're in so that's it Steve Jobs had a lot of other things
00:29:00.76 --> 00:29:07.72 that made him successful and leadership and and he I'm going to eventually read the book but
00:29:08.52 --> 00:29:17.56 he clearly had some people around him that that utilized that skill the skills that he did
00:29:17.56 --> 00:29:24.20 had and have and move help moving forward right other people at the company other people early in Apple
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:27.72 saw that hey you know what this guy he might be a little bit hard to deal with but he's got some
00:29:27.72 --> 00:29:31.56 things that we won't find anywhere else so let's prop them up and let's move forward
00:29:32.44 --> 00:29:38.44 and that's that's the way it works yeah I think they call that survivor ship bias where you're like
00:29:39.40 --> 00:29:44.44 you see oh you see a successful guy you know yeah yeah he did it that way so let's do it that way
00:29:44.44 --> 00:29:50.04 but yeah you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever almost like you if you really
00:29:50.04 --> 00:29:54.84 think about it if Steve Jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways or whatever if you were to be
00:29:54.84 --> 00:29:58.84 less like that maybe there would be more because they were more similar but he was so strong in
00:29:58.84 --> 00:30:03.88 these other areas that it kind of like mitigated the effects you know there's there's businesses
00:30:03.88 --> 00:30:08.60 that are successful because there are successful business model and they have really bad leadership
00:30:08.60 --> 00:30:11.88 yeah and even that kind of mess there's still kind of thing that yeah even the bad leadership
00:30:11.88 --> 00:30:17.56 doesn't if it's the the model is so good yeah which is a little bit contrary because you know
00:30:17.56 --> 00:30:21.000 I always say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield but in the business world if you
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.72 have a phenomenal idea then you can you can be successful on that idea alone now that is that is
00:30:27.72 --> 00:30:31.96 a unicorn that is one of those rare things where you have something that's that incredibly
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:38.36 different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going to be successful no matter what
00:30:38.36 --> 00:30:45.80 you know when the when the early gyms MMA type gyms if you had one you were successful
00:30:45.80 --> 00:30:50.84 didn't matter what kind of leader you were because you had you had it and now there's competition
00:30:50.84 --> 00:30:54.04 if you're not if you're not good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product amongst
00:30:54.04 --> 00:30:57.88 all the competitors you're going to have problems yeah you're going to have problems with it yeah
00:30:57.88 --> 00:31:04.44 and the more I kind of listen to you in life the more I realize that even then the like
00:31:04.44 --> 00:31:09.96 it's almost like you have to have a minimum level of leadership like you don't be
00:31:09.96 --> 00:31:13.32 have to be perfect if you have one of these situations where the product of the business
00:31:13.32 --> 00:31:18.52 is so good but still even your leadership can mess that oh yeah you can absolutely because
00:31:18.52 --> 00:31:22.60 you shouldn't yeah like here in a situation where like no no no one wants to work for you now
00:31:22.60 --> 00:31:27.40 what oh yeah good nice MMA gym you don't have any you got to work there yeah you know the whole
00:31:27.40 --> 00:31:31.48 time and you can't you know so it's going to kind of fall apart after a while so maybe like
00:31:31.48 --> 00:31:36.20 in the beginning it would be good but it'll fall apart because of your last year for sure and you
00:31:36.20 --> 00:31:42.20 can see that I mean who's the guy that just got removed from Uber I'd have to go into the
00:31:42.20 --> 00:31:50.44 I'd have to really drill down on it but the CEO of Uber got removed and you know the business
00:31:50.44 --> 00:31:57.64 models awesome yeah and they still remove the CEO why because there's there's issues there
00:31:57.64 --> 00:32:03.72 yeah and so well it's a great business model but we still need good leadership yeah so yeah
00:32:03.72 --> 00:32:08.60 like you like I'm basically confirming what you just said the good business model will get you
00:32:08.92 --> 00:32:13.24 to a certain level but then to get to the next level you're gonna need leadership and that's why
00:32:13.24 --> 00:32:21.24 leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield mm-hmm so what the moral don't necessarily
00:32:21.24 --> 00:32:28.84 be tyrannical little in fact don't be straight up tyrannical don't be and I'm not saying that
00:32:28.84 --> 00:32:33.80 there's not times where you have to have a little tyrannical flare because they're there maybe
00:32:33.80 --> 00:32:38.68 times where you need to where you need to flare up a little bit yeah but it should be rare
00:32:39.40 --> 00:32:42.76 yeah it should be rare the problem is it becomes a crutch for people and then they just continue
00:32:42.76 --> 00:32:48.04 to do it more and more and more and then it doesn't work it's like it's kind of like drugs to
00:32:48.04 --> 00:32:53.48 regret the like when you like when you flare up on someone and and you win or whatever you know
00:32:53.48 --> 00:32:57.24 you kind of like it worked yeah I worked and you kind of like it feels good feels powerful
00:32:58.68 --> 00:33:03.72 so I think some people that's how you know so they'll do it in an a work and they'll be like yeah
00:33:03.72 --> 00:33:08.28 I will need that little yeah and what's even worse is like when you when that's where you you learn
00:33:08.28 --> 00:33:13.32 from someone that's what you saw and then you do it and you go out work for me too and all you have to
00:33:13.32 --> 00:33:19.48 be is treat people bad and be a jerk and yell and my subordinates will do what I tell them to do
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:24.52 and they will right a subordinate will if you bark at them and scream at them they're going to
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:29.24 do what you say at the moment the problem is what kind of team of you built that's the problem
00:33:29.88 --> 00:33:33.40 what is that subordinate going to do when you're not there they're going to do everything they can
00:33:33.40 --> 00:33:37.48 to cut corners and and really they don't care about they don't care about you they don't want to
00:33:37.48 --> 00:33:41.48 do good job for you yeah so when you're not there they're not going to do a good job for you yeah
00:33:41.48 --> 00:33:47.16 so you get addicted to yelling and screaming but it doesn't work in the broad sense of what you're
00:33:47.16 --> 00:33:54.68 trying to make happen yeah slowly pulling apart that's a question i'm 26 years old i'm currently
00:33:54.68 --> 00:34:01.32 an undercover detective i've recently been told that i'm being promoted to sergeant over department's
00:34:01.32 --> 00:34:06.84 investigations division i've been the youngest person to hold that position in our department's history
00:34:06.84 --> 00:34:13.80 all the guys i'll be in charge of our much older some in their late 40s how do i as a younger
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:20.44 leader lead them how do you demand an earn respect from an older group i'm ready for the job and
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:27.24 know what the job entails but i'm nervous to lead a group of nine people that are all older than me so
00:34:27.24 --> 00:34:32.84 i'm i've answered this question over and over again and i'm going to do a quick job over here just
00:34:32.84 --> 00:34:39.000 because people may not they have gone back and listen to all all the other podcasts but you
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.96 have listened the answers always the same and it's always the same whether you're a young person
00:34:43.96 --> 00:34:48.36 leading old person whether you're an old person leading young for people whether you're a woman
00:34:48.36 --> 00:34:53.80 leading man a man leading man leading women whether you're coming in from a different department
00:34:53.80 --> 00:34:56.92 into a new department that you don't know anybody whether you're going into a thing that you
00:34:56.92 --> 00:35:01.000 don't have the experience it's like all of the same basically what it is you're going into a
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000 leadership position yeah that's what it is be humble listen take advice build relationships keep your
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.76 ego in check also that one of the reasons i pulled the dead pull this question i was like how do
00:35:12.76 --> 00:35:19.08 you demand respect will be answers you don't demand respect and if you don't if you do demand
00:35:19.08 --> 00:35:26.36 respect you'll get anything but respect from people so so get that out of your head you earn respect
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:31.96 and how do you earn respect you respect them in this case you respect their experience you
00:35:31.96 --> 00:35:37.72 respect their knowledge you respect it they've been doing it for a long time you have respect for it
00:35:37.72 --> 00:35:44.36 and when you show respect for them they're going to respect you back now none of this means be passive
00:35:45.80 --> 00:35:52.20 right this doesn't mean coward down no you you still have to lead you still have to step up
00:35:52.20 --> 00:35:58.36 but it does mean be humble be open minded be proactive listen ask questions ask for opinions
00:35:59.48 --> 00:36:05.48 decentralized all aspects of operations including the planning which we already talked about
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:14.28 and then with all those things set a high standard and then the final and most important well
00:36:14.28 --> 00:36:22.12 I don't know it's equally important I'd say work harder than everyone else and expect nothing in return
00:36:23.88 --> 00:36:30.44 that's it that's it you're the boss you better be it you better be at work before everyone and you better be
00:36:31.48 --> 00:36:37.32 leaving work after everyone and that's how you develop a reputation of being a hard worker and being a
00:36:37.32 --> 00:36:44.92 hard worker and it's own right garners respect from most people there's there's a fraction of losers
00:36:44.92 --> 00:36:50.68 that are like oh echo he works so much it's it's so lame like no like as I'm making him look
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:53.96 bad or something like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:36:53.96 --> 00:36:59.48 like there's a small fraction of people that that might think that way but but no you work harder
00:37:00.36 --> 00:37:04.84 you you put in the time you put in the effort you study you read which you're supposed to read
00:37:04.84 --> 00:37:09.48 you get the professional knowledge that you're supposed to get you don't impose that on people
00:37:09.48 --> 00:37:12.76 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because you're your book knowledge when you start
00:37:12.76 --> 00:37:17.08 off in this situation your book knowledge isn't as strong as the experience guys in in this case
00:37:17.08 --> 00:37:21.72 you know in the in the law enforcement the guys that have been in the streets they know stuff that
00:37:21.72 --> 00:37:27.72 you don't know yeah so you study what you can but you keep an open mind so you can listen to
00:37:27.72 --> 00:37:36.04 what their experience says yeah okay don't impose on them wait when you say don't impose it
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:42.28 on them does that mean don't impose them like make them it's like them echo section four two
00:37:42.28 --> 00:37:47.08 alpha of the document says that we're supposed to use this methodology when we do this
00:37:47.88 --> 00:37:52.12 you should know that methodology you should understand why that methodology is important but
00:37:52.12 --> 00:37:55.96 if you say hey juggle we don't do that way and here's why I shouldn't be like oh I'm telling you
00:37:55.96 --> 00:38:00.20 that's by the book yeah it's by the book now if it's by the book because it's there's an
00:38:00.20 --> 00:38:06.04 ethical reason okay well that makes sense but if it's by the book because that's what the book says
00:38:06.04 --> 00:38:11.96 but by the book yeah yeah or you know the guy who's like who works extra hard but he kind of
00:38:11.96 --> 00:38:15.48 in a way throws it in everyone's face how hard he works you know don't do that guy that's
00:38:15.48 --> 00:38:19.08 that's an important thing it's a very important piece don't you don't step on people's toes with
00:38:19.08 --> 00:38:27.000 this stuff yeah that's wrong don't do that yeah let's check check
00:38:27.96 --> 00:38:34.12 X-Wish juggle I'm extremely extremely driven and have high expectations for myself
00:38:34.12 --> 00:38:41.24 and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and their developing negative
00:38:41.24 --> 00:38:47.24 attitudes I feel like you're going to say play the game and develop relationships with them
00:38:47.24 --> 00:38:55.48 which are really just ignore who I am should I try to be someone different than myself
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:05.08 yeah well you called it question person whoever has this question you called I it's exactly what
00:39:05.08 --> 00:39:09.40 I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you need to play the game look at what your current path has done
00:39:10.84 --> 00:39:16.44 look at what you the real you look what it's done the real you has created a negative attitude
00:39:16.44 --> 00:39:22.44 with all your team that's the real you so is that what you want to perpetuate
00:39:23.24 --> 00:39:27.16 creating negative attitudes against your with your team and by the way they're just getting started
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:30.36 and if you think negative if you think you're going to keep acting the same way and the negative
00:39:30.36 --> 00:39:34.20 attitude they're going to somehow miraculously turn positive that's not happening they're going to
00:39:34.20 --> 00:39:41.80 get more negative yeah so when people have negative attitudes I saw somebody quoted this
00:39:41.80 --> 00:39:49.72 the other day on social media somewhere you know the quote was like no no no it's not my fault
00:39:49.72 --> 00:39:55.64 when I my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that and about a bunch of people responded
00:39:55.64 --> 00:40:00.68 you should read the book extreme ownership because it absolutely is your fault it is your fault
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:05.80 if your team has a bad attitude it's your fault you're the leader you only attitude if they're
00:40:05.80 --> 00:40:09.96 attitude is bad then it's then it's actually your fault now this is not to say that you can't
00:40:09.96 --> 00:40:14.20 have a bad apple on the team that's completely possible and who's responsible for getting rid of
00:40:14.20 --> 00:40:19.16 the bad apples you are you're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:23.88 uh bad apple on your team you might even have two bad apples on your team you don't have
00:40:23.88 --> 00:40:29.08 14 bad apples on the team when you have 14 battles the apples on the team guess who the problem is
00:40:29.08 --> 00:40:38.60 it's you so here's what you do little little tactical advice trying get some perspective
00:40:38.60 --> 00:40:44.68 from them trying to understand where they're coming from what challenges they face what's pulling them off
00:40:44.68 --> 00:40:51.56 track and when you do this you kind of take ownership of it in your approach so you say hey guys
00:40:51.56 --> 00:40:57.48 I realize I don't think I'm really seeing things from your point of view and I need to because I'm
00:40:57.48 --> 00:41:04.52 here to support you and without you performing well then we fail so I think I need to do a better
00:41:04.52 --> 00:41:09.000 job supporting you and I can only do that if I know what your issues are so I can do my best to
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.44 get them fixed so what can I do better to help you right so now they're going to start telling you
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:19.16 all here's what here's that's problem there's that problem and then what you do is you listen to
00:41:19.16 --> 00:41:23.88 their problems you actually listen to their problems you don't say hey you're complaining
00:41:25.08 --> 00:41:30.36 no you actually listen to their problems and then you actually see what you can do to mitigate
00:41:30.36 --> 00:41:38.12 their issues and as you do that guess what's happening you're actually forming a bond you're actually
00:41:38.12 --> 00:41:46.92 forming into a team because you're working together to solve issues again I it sounds really simple
00:41:46.92 --> 00:41:52.76 right but clearly here's someone asking this question now again like if you have some members of the
00:41:52.76 --> 00:42:00.12 team that are that are actual negative complaining winers then you might have to get rid of them
00:42:01.72 --> 00:42:05.56 and that's part of being a leader is knowing when you have to get rid of someone
00:42:08.36 --> 00:42:14.44 you know I sometimes people they they take the extreme ownership attitude and they say you know what
00:42:15.80 --> 00:42:21.32 I'm the leader I own everything I'm extreme ownership and if someone's not performing well
00:42:21.32 --> 00:42:26.36 then that's my fault yeah that's my fault I need to coach more I need to I need to do it's my fault
00:42:26.36 --> 00:42:31.48 that my team member is not doing well and that's correct it is your fault it's your responsibility
00:42:31.48 --> 00:42:35.88 to train them coach them mentor and do whatever else you can do to fix them but at the end of the
00:42:35.88 --> 00:42:42.76 day if they still are not competent at their task and you've done everything you can it's
00:42:42.76 --> 00:42:49.08 your responsible to get rid of them that is also a part of ownership so
00:42:49.08 --> 00:42:54.84 yeah like I'll have someone complaining that they've got oh this you know one of my team leaders
00:42:54.84 --> 00:42:58.52 like they're talking about their subordinate team leaders no no one might this this guy is
00:42:58.52 --> 00:43:04.60 you just a bad leader why is he still here oh your team that team isn't doing well because
00:43:04.60 --> 00:43:08.12 they have a bad leader who's fault is that well the leaders fault no it's your fault you're
00:43:08.12 --> 00:43:15.08 in charge of the leader yeah is ridiculous so back to the original question
00:43:15.08 --> 00:43:23.40 you're whatever you call that you're who you actually are is not working well he probably is
00:43:23.40 --> 00:43:27.88 thinking he's a Steve Jobs type I have you know what you call we gotta do this but it's not working
00:43:29.08 --> 00:43:34.60 and he's not in a unicorn business model that's still making a ton of money regardless so
00:43:34.60 --> 00:43:42.60 what does he have to do play the game build relationships see the perspective of your team so that
00:43:42.60 --> 00:43:51.96 you can actually form a team be a better leader that's basically what I'm saying yeah so they
00:43:51.96 --> 00:43:58.44 and it's interesting the you know what they call framing you know you frame something
00:43:58.44 --> 00:44:03.08 in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way whatever so he's an extremely driven
00:44:03.08 --> 00:44:09.48 and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too
00:44:09.48 --> 00:44:15.32 hard and they're developing negative attitude so having extremely being extremely driven and having
00:44:15.32 --> 00:44:21.72 high expectations doesn't equal driving them too hard so they develop negative attitude those are
00:44:21.72 --> 00:44:30.60 two different things you know you can still be extremely high expectations you can be driving
00:44:30.60 --> 00:44:36.28 extremely hard and you can still have a incredibly positive attitude with your team yeah no doubt
00:44:36.28 --> 00:44:43.96 yeah good point so and then it gets equated into that's just who I am so he just kind of put
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:49.24 it all into one ball and without one there's no other kind of situation it's just not how it is
00:44:49.24 --> 00:44:55.88 so apparently you might be committed he might be committed to being all of these things and that's
00:44:55.88 --> 00:45:00.52 who I am and that's kind of it you know kind of thing and I think that's like the mistake
00:45:00.52 --> 00:45:04.12 planning people make we say this a lot where people will be like hey I'm just straightforward you know
00:45:04.12 --> 00:45:08.52 take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like okay but you're gonna in your case lose you
00:45:08.52 --> 00:45:15.64 know in your in your situation that's the big piece is that in their case they're gonna lose yeah
00:45:15.64 --> 00:45:23.48 so let me ask you this question if you're so driven and you have such high expectations that you
00:45:23.48 --> 00:45:29.64 want to win so bad but the way you're performing as a human being and as a leader is going to
00:45:29.64 --> 00:45:35.48 make you lose then what are you supposed to do if you change the way you behave you will come
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:44.52 a better leader yeah that's what you do yes sir so you take and this is total speculation on my
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:51.56 part but you keep so this equation that we're presented with being extremely driven keep that
00:45:51.56 --> 00:45:56.28 high expectations keep that pushing your team hard keep that I would say too hard and that's
00:45:56.28 --> 00:46:01.32 gonna be a judgment call from day to day for sure but there's a parting here that's more implied
00:46:01.32 --> 00:46:05.08 that you're being an asshole somewhere in here you're being an asshole how about you take out that
00:46:05.08 --> 00:46:10.04 part take out the being the asshole part and then keep everything else see all that goes yeah
00:46:10.44 --> 00:46:14.68 because you kind of know when you're being a dick you don't see unless you're like not being honest
00:46:14.68 --> 00:46:18.44 with yourself there are some people that don't there's some people that don't get it
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:23.64 there's some people that don't get it all right because it's like you know how like when you
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:29.88 don't like people they just can't step outside of themselves and you said to me I wouldn't care
00:46:29.88 --> 00:46:35.32 kind of thing and be like bro you you know you're not me and why am I you kind of yeah you're right
00:46:35.32 --> 00:46:41.000 they kept attached yeah absolutely people that don't know yeah socially
00:46:43.16 --> 00:46:50.60 incapable of receiving you know clues social clues yeah people social cues from people yeah
00:46:50.60 --> 00:46:55.000 you know they don't see the look in their face when they're talking to them yeah that's true
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.12 I mean I'm thinking of like three examples for sure there's all kinds of examples yeah also
00:47:00.12 --> 00:47:04.52 that then that would go back to what you're saying how you see get input from them you're just so you
00:47:04.52 --> 00:47:09.000 got to kind of yeah see yeah you can do it that's a solvable problem so this is a very solvable
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.04 problem and I've seen people solve this problem I've helped people solve this exact problem
00:47:16.04 --> 00:47:22.76 and the weird thing is they think and it's part ego but it's also part they're just
00:47:22.76 --> 00:47:28.12 don't present they think they're doing a great thing like they think that they're
00:47:28.12 --> 00:47:33.72 driving everything that they're doing in their mind they're just awesome for being
00:47:33.72 --> 00:47:38.12 supproposient so hard it's just the way I am and all that stuff and they think it's awesome
00:47:38.68 --> 00:47:45.08 but again if you want to win so bad then you have to play the game you won't win
00:47:45.08 --> 00:47:52.04 by abusing people you won't win with a team anyways you won't it won't happen yeah
00:47:55.24 --> 00:47:58.52 it's no use being the best dancer if you're not invited on the dance floor
00:48:00.12 --> 00:48:03.16 I'll leave that one with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:48:03.16 --> 00:48:09.64 always that cool next question actually that problem is so solvable that you could this is
00:48:09.64 --> 00:48:16.44 possible where you could just show just that much like more I don't know caring or respect just
00:48:16.44 --> 00:48:21.000 that much respect and do for like two weeks yeah just the idea that just the fact that you're
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000 doing it now people will be like hey wait you should leave it here's the thing here's the thing
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000 if a person has an ego which this person could very well have a big ego because that's why
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.24 they have these high expectations and that's why they're so driven because they just they
00:48:35.24 --> 00:48:40.44 if they have that kind of ego that's the person that you can't help because if they just look at
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:44.68 the team and say those guys should be harder workers yeah those guys aren't working as hard as
00:48:44.68 --> 00:48:52.28 me they're not as focused as I am they don't care as much as I do so to everyone else on the team
00:48:53.08 --> 00:49:00.20 has a problem but I'm perfect and you can't you know look at how driven I am look at how focused I am
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:06.20 look at how high my expectations are of myself but if you can here's another thing if your team
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:11.48 cannot relate to your expectations like they don't even they don't even see him as realistic or achievable
00:49:11.48 --> 00:49:17.48 or anything what could have your expectations yeah what good are they they're only good okay
00:49:17.48 --> 00:49:19.48 they don't make any sense
00:49:22.36 --> 00:49:27.16 next question dear juggle I've been watching some of you YouTube links with great interest
00:49:27.16 --> 00:49:36.68 must be a subscriber to the YouTube channel yeah watch the videos I'm sure you're extremely busy
00:49:36.68 --> 00:49:41.80 but I have a question which if you have time I would greatly appreciate your reply I have taken
00:49:41.80 --> 00:49:50.44 the light opening very much so I'm going to incorporate that approach I've been I've taken up
00:49:50.44 --> 00:50:00.36 BJJ G2 recently in London in the UK so so a beginner I know you're a great advocate of the
00:50:00.36 --> 00:50:06.76 system but my basic question is your opinion does it truly relate to real life fight situations
00:50:06.76 --> 00:50:12.60 I'm a man now approaching my mid 40s in pretty good shape that I'm looking to focus on a martial art
00:50:12.60 --> 00:50:17.64 that would help me if I ever need to defend myself or my family I love the discipline and humility
00:50:17.64 --> 00:50:25.08 of BJJ and as a workout I know and I know the philosophy of BJJ is that most fights end up on the ground
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:33.56 and it's here that BJJ excels but what of the other guys or what of the other guys who might be
00:50:33.56 --> 00:50:39.96 standing around ready to battle bottle you or kick you in the hand once you're grappling on the
00:50:39.96 --> 00:50:47.08 ground etc again this is a question that first of all we I mean I have to listen a lot of times
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:50.68 sure but I'll answer it one more time here uh it.
00:50:52.28 --> 00:50:57.40 BJJ is the best place to start you should also learn boxing wrestling kick boxing this is all
00:50:57.40 --> 00:51:01.80 in discipline because freedom field manual so if you get that book you this will be laid out for you very
00:51:01.80 --> 00:51:09.80 well does so so yes that's what you should start studying with this guy mid 40s needs wants to
00:51:09.80 --> 00:51:17.72 learn something yes start with your jitsu does it relate to real life situations yes it does it absolutely
00:51:17.72 --> 00:51:25.24 does I've been in them it's extremely effective and you can see that over and over again speaking
00:51:25.24 --> 00:51:34.04 of YouTube you can see how effective your jitsu is in real fights now it's important to remember
00:51:34.04 --> 00:51:40.12 that for self defense the grappling arts in general should be used primarily to get away
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.64 it to avoid going to the ground right like when you bring up oh well there's one of those
00:51:45.64 --> 00:51:51.80 other people that might be there you you should why are you on the ground jjitsu will give you the best
00:51:51.80 --> 00:51:57.16 opportunity to get up off the ground that's what it gives you and then you can get away from the
00:51:57.16 --> 00:52:01.08 people that are getting ready to stick you with a bottle smashed bottle or getting ready to kick
00:52:01.08 --> 00:52:04.68 you in the head if you don't know jjitsu guess what you're doing you're on the ground and you're
00:52:04.68 --> 00:52:08.84 getting kicked in the head and you're getting stabbed with a bottle that's why you train jjitsu
00:52:08.84 --> 00:52:13.64 so you can get up off the ground not so you can take someone to the ground because by the way and
00:52:13.64 --> 00:52:18.92 I've said this before if your goal is to punch me and you're standing at a punching distance or
00:52:18.92 --> 00:52:23.80 striking distance from me I can just run away that's myself defense I can get away from you
00:52:23.80 --> 00:52:32.84 so that's why we train jjitsu that's the primer that's why you should start with it
00:52:32.84 --> 00:52:37.80 because otherwise I'm just gonna get away from you if you're not grab if once you grab me though
00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:43.64 I can't get away from you anymore now I have to be able to do handle myself that's why
00:52:43.64 --> 00:52:47.40 I know jjitsu so I can handle myself once you've grabbed me if you're not grabbing me I can
00:52:47.40 --> 00:52:52.44 just get away from you I can just run away from you if you don't want to run away because it's
00:52:52.44 --> 00:52:56.52 gonna hurt your pride well then guess what that's that's why you train all the time
00:52:57.24 --> 00:53:01.48 I mean now we go back and forth and we can talk about all the negative things that will happen
00:53:01.48 --> 00:53:04.84 if you get into a street fight like the fact that you can get hurt you can get stabbed you can get shot
00:53:04.84 --> 00:53:09.16 you can get sued you can get arrested you can ruin your life you can do all these horrible things
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:14.44 can happen if you get in a street fight so so so that's why my advice to you is to avoid street fights
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:18.28 yeah that's what you do and by the way that's why you work on your awareness that's why you make
00:53:18.28 --> 00:53:23.96 your your your your wife and your children aware of what's going on around them to pay attention to
00:53:23.96 --> 00:53:27.72 what's happening in the street so one thing that was interesting when I was in Australia and I was in
00:53:27.72 --> 00:53:33.80 the nice part of Australia there's and I was talking to some people about it you know there's just
00:53:33.80 --> 00:53:41.000 a very relaxed atmosphere where I was I was standing at a very nice part of Australia there's a
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:49.48 very relaxed atmosphere when you're in America there's a heightened atmosphere there's a heightened
00:53:49.48 --> 00:53:52.68 awareness you have to have and depending on where you are and it's the same thing I'm sure in
00:53:52.68 --> 00:53:57.000 Australia I'll go on the way to the nice part I'm sure you could go to some some tough areas where you
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.20 better be more aware of what's happening but teach your kids because some kids don't know the
00:54:02.20 --> 00:54:07.08 difference maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for what kind of people you
00:54:07.08 --> 00:54:15.96 need to watch out for in the street so work on that and then yes train and up here in U.K. and
00:54:15.96 --> 00:54:21.64 of course I've said this before if you're truly in a situation where you feel threatened on
00:54:21.64 --> 00:54:28.44 the regular basis well then what you need is a firearm because if someone's going to attack you
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:33.24 with a knife or with a bottle or with themselves having a gun the only you did to it's going to help you
00:54:33.24 --> 00:54:41.56 boxing is going to help you as scream is not going to help you someone has a gun so yeah and
00:54:41.56 --> 00:54:45.64 by the way oh yeah if you're in a knife fight and you know some a scream of that will help you
00:54:46.20 --> 00:54:52.12 but what if the other guys better than you what what if there's two of them the minute you put
00:54:52.12 --> 00:55:00.04 two people against one the odds of winning are it just extremely low extremely low does it happen
00:55:00.04 --> 00:55:05.72 yes it happens can you knock someone out yes you can that's why you train boxing yeah so
00:55:07.48 --> 00:55:14.04 yes again train some jiu jitsu start there and go and keep going and don't stop yeah yeah
00:55:14.04 --> 00:55:18.12 it seems like this question always comes from a place where they just assume all these things and those
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:23.80 things are I'm going to choose to get in a fight with someone bring it to the ground in the middle of
00:55:23.80 --> 00:55:28.68 the street or in the club I don't know wherever wherever there's potential other attackers with bottles
00:55:28.68 --> 00:55:33.64 man kicks to the head and so all these things are just assumed kind of like yeah you take
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:37.80 jitsu now you can go to the club and get in fights and win all the time it's kind of like that's
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:43.000 kind of where the questions coming from where how you said yeah it allows you to get up and so
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.28 basically it allows you to control your situation your fight scenario yeah more yes and I would even say
00:55:50.28 --> 00:55:56.76 it allows you a lot more to control it because even if even if you do take it let's say you take it
00:55:56.76 --> 00:56:02.60 to the ground I met more by a little bit more than nothing yeah no yeah I'm saying a lot more
00:56:02.60 --> 00:56:09.48 because really when you think of it and I try to granted them yeah even like at a beginner level so
00:56:09.48 --> 00:56:17.80 let's say okay if you choose to engage with someone and some kind of fight right it's up to you how
00:56:18.60 --> 00:56:22.68 heavy you want to take that fight you you want to go to 10 you go to 10 you want to go to just one
00:56:22.68 --> 00:56:27.40 you can go to one so if you wind up on the ground which is the worst place to be if you don't know
00:56:27.40 --> 00:56:31.72 anything on the ground yeah and that's a side from how you said if the guy's a gun in shoot you
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:34.92 that's a dare you're talking about that's not even a fight scenario that's you know
00:56:35.88 --> 00:56:45.88 so you wind up on the ground it's a gunfight yeah if you know boxing you're gonna have
00:56:45.88 --> 00:56:49.88 almost no control over that scenario we're in the comments on the ground top yeah yeah
00:56:49.88 --> 00:56:55.80 your boxing is your boxing is not worthless you know marginalized we'll say but it's
00:56:55.80 --> 00:57:01.96 heavily marginalized yeah heavily marginalized yeah same thing with you know kickboxing and whatever
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:07.96 so there's that if you know Jesus you're just a little bit of Jesus too if you're on the ground
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:13.88 you have control over the fight more depending on your level whatever so if you if you're at that
00:57:13.88 --> 00:57:17.96 point still facing a threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or whatever while you're
00:57:17.96 --> 00:57:24.44 on the ground compare if you know Jesus you're still saving way more control way more so
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.28 meanwhile like the box situation or karate situation whenever it's gonna be less effective in
00:57:30.28 --> 00:57:37.24 controlling your situation no if you don't look at it like that like if you look at it like okay
00:57:37.24 --> 00:57:43.64 this guy's squaring up to me now I want to mess it up as quickly as I can then okay you know like
00:57:43.64 --> 00:57:48.20 you can do boxing and just take it to ten but you don't have the option of taking it from one
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:54.52 two through nothing like yeah but the other thing is like it's hard to knock someone out
00:57:55.72 --> 00:58:01.56 that's the thing it's hard to knock someone out does it happen yeah it does happen and it can
00:58:01.56 --> 00:58:08.60 happen you do it can happen you do it's but it's hard to knock someone out and it's it's risky as
00:58:08.60 --> 00:58:13.96 soon as you start saying okay you and I are gonna just trade punches there's a risk for both of us
00:58:13.96 --> 00:58:20.68 there's a risk for me the assurance of me being able to handle the situation the way I want it to go
00:58:20.68 --> 00:58:26.04 by closing the distance with you getting control getting a hold of you if I'm trained and you're not
00:58:26.76 --> 00:58:32.60 you're you're you're you're you're done you're done right that's the way it works yeah and then
00:58:32.60 --> 00:58:37.48 even then that's like if you choose for this guy to be done so if you're if your sole purpose is to
00:58:37.48 --> 00:58:41.32 keep yourself safe yeah you could just put the guy to sleep and walk away yeah or gently
00:58:41.32 --> 00:58:45.32 lame down like I'm not even heard I'm not gonna put him to sleep nothing mount you see a guy
00:58:45.32 --> 00:58:51.000 you can see the guy coming with a bottle or whatever anymore if you know you get to so yeah well there's
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.12 the whole thing of when you're just used to the physical contact the the the body's
00:58:58.12 --> 00:59:07.88 clashing and you know grappling let's shock yeah so yeah trained to get to train boxing wrestling
00:59:07.88 --> 00:59:11.72 kick boxing and then of course now people will be like what about judo yes trained judo
00:59:11.72 --> 00:59:15.64 what about sombo yes trained sombo what else what else do I need to cool what about
00:59:15.64 --> 00:59:21.56 crawvlogger sure train it yeah train everything yeah I'm down I think star would you do
00:59:21.56 --> 00:59:25.48 what you said on a real general level is the most critical things like when someone gets a
00:59:25.48 --> 00:59:29.56 hold of you like and you put this into perspective a while ago when you were like yeah if someone
00:59:29.56 --> 00:59:35.000 wants to fight you walk away for run away you can use a butt and you said all these scenarios you
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.72 run away you go away you want to keep yourself safe you don't be there the best thing to do to avoid
00:59:40.28 --> 00:59:45.72 the the getting punched falling on the curb dying getting stabbed getting kicked getting stabbed
00:59:45.72 --> 00:59:50.20 with the bottle getting arrested getting lawsuit getting all those things happening the best thing
00:59:50.20 --> 00:59:56.84 to run away walk away yeah leave fully and then you said but what happens when you can't run away
00:59:56.84 --> 01:00:02.12 because I grab there you have it yeah so yeah so it seems like yeah I'm gonna train boxing so
01:00:02.12 --> 01:00:05.88 I can do self-defense oh no you want to fight somebody that's what you want to do you want to
01:00:05.88 --> 01:00:12.84 punch people in the face well boxing juditsu I mean yeah I mean boxing is a skill that every
01:00:13.80 --> 01:00:19.24 but he should have not everyone good people should have because there's two critical things on
01:00:19.24 --> 01:00:23.08 that that you learn from boxing is how to punch people and how to avoid getting punched yeah
01:00:23.08 --> 01:00:27.64 and how to keep your guard up right it was an important it was a really important skills to have
01:00:27.64 --> 01:00:32.44 yeah fully but what what I mean is if you're starting from nothing and you're like okay I'm
01:00:32.44 --> 01:00:38.52 gonna you know I'm gonna choose to address myself defense you situation you have a fantasy
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:44.68 that you saw a guy on youtube that was clearly a boxer knock up knock out two people in a street
01:00:44.68 --> 01:00:49.000 fight and you're like that's what I'm gonna do yeah yeah and what you actually watched was a guy
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.92 that was a golden gloves boxer yeah who is sober knock out two drunk idiots and guess what a
01:00:56.92 --> 01:01:01.000 golden gloves boxer will do that if you're a part of the golden gloves boxer they're freaking good
01:01:01.96 --> 01:01:09.08 they're freaking good they're they're they're you know like a black belt in boxing yeah
01:01:09.80 --> 01:01:16.36 and they will knock out two drunk guys all day long yeah yeah it's weird too because he kind of
01:01:16.36 --> 01:01:21.40 but if one of those if a third drunk guy or even that first drunk guy grabs a hold of the
01:01:21.40 --> 01:01:26.52 boxer and just and gets him to the ground the boxer's gonna be in trouble yeah that's the way it is
01:01:26.52 --> 01:01:32.28 we and this is like my thoughts this is fact this is like I talked about this in this
01:01:32.28 --> 01:01:39.40 in the field manual is like look there's no conjecture it's not like I wonder what would happen
01:01:39.40 --> 01:01:46.36 no we know what happens we know what happens when two people fight and and you can watch all the
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:54.04 different various types of styles going at it and you can watch what happens and sure you can find
01:01:54.04 --> 01:02:00.12 the rare video where hey this boxer knocks out a couple drunk people or or or even hey the
01:02:00.12 --> 01:02:04.68 boxer knocks out the jutsu guy does that happen yes it can absolutely happen that's why you train
01:02:04.68 --> 01:02:12.04 boxing too yeah next question I've not been working out regularly regularly for several years now
01:02:12.04 --> 01:02:20.60 obviously I'm fat and lazy but I want to get after it so the question is should I go all in level nine
01:02:20.60 --> 01:02:29.56 destruction maximum madness or ease into it at level three cruising edition respect all right well this
01:02:29.56 --> 01:02:36.12 there's a couple different approaches now when I hear this first of all you you don't want to get hurt
01:02:36.12 --> 01:02:42.60 right and you also don't want to make yourself trying do things that are so hard and so painful that
01:02:43.48 --> 01:02:49.40 you can't do it repeatedly so if you just destroy yourself what do you say if you destroy yourself
01:02:49.40 --> 01:02:53.80 level nine destruction maximum madness but then you can't work out for two more weeks
01:02:53.80 --> 01:02:57.96 well guess what what you do in the mean no let's say realistically you got domes
01:02:57.96 --> 01:03:05.24 come sure right delayed onset muscle so let's say you did so many burpees that your legs
01:03:05.24 --> 01:03:12.36 you couldn't sit down without your legs being in pain so now so you take so you take three days
01:03:13.08 --> 01:03:18.92 four days have you ever had domes so bad that you took four days off no okay let's say you take three days
01:03:18.92 --> 01:03:23.80 off what did you do during those three days did you hold the line did you stay on the path
01:03:23.80 --> 01:03:31.16 are we you eating cheetos yeah yeah that's what you were doing so if you destroy yourself
01:03:31.16 --> 01:03:35.32 to where you can't stay on the path that's not good you want to stay on the path
01:03:37.16 --> 01:03:42.92 I think doing something that you can handle or maybe something just beyond what you can handle
01:03:42.92 --> 01:03:47.96 every single day is more important so going at a level not not cruising level
01:03:47.96 --> 01:03:53.88 not level three but let's let's find a solid level five where you can you're pushing yourself
01:03:53.88 --> 01:03:59.48 I read a thousand words a day when I'm writing and do the equivalent of that right
01:03:59.48 --> 01:04:03.24 the reason I read because if I said okay I do not just to today I just have to write
01:04:04.36 --> 01:04:09.56 five thousand words that's five hours yeah we do I have five hours today no I don't
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:15.64 I can squeeze out 52 minutes though and get a thousand words written that I can do so that's
01:04:15.64 --> 01:04:21.56 that's what I think you need to do you need to get consistent if you bite off more than you chew
01:04:22.12 --> 01:04:26.52 then you can chew you you might very well choke on it so don't so don't do that
01:04:27.64 --> 01:04:33.56 so pick something realistic don't do people say that that must be the first time I heard it
01:04:33.56 --> 01:04:37.40 so if you bite out more than you can chew you might choke on it did you make that up or you get
01:04:37.40 --> 01:04:42.12 that from somewhere I think I well I just I don't know I think I made it up just good but I'm sure
01:04:42.12 --> 01:04:50.52 something like no this guy said it in 1978 yeah but that's the beauty of it so pick something
01:04:50.52 --> 01:04:55.80 realistic like for something that you can handle and then get after it then the other thing here
01:04:55.80 --> 01:05:03.40 is he doesn't talk about this diet at all and that's clearly equally important and you have to change
01:05:05.48 --> 01:05:08.36 your diet if you're going to change your life and you're going to change your health so stop eating
01:05:08.36 --> 01:05:13.24 sugar stop eating processed foods no more soda and juices and no more gatorade
01:05:15.08 --> 01:05:19.64 just to start with whatever is whatever that it is that you're doing
01:05:19.64 --> 01:05:24.20 whoever asks this question whatever you know what you're doing if you're eating donuts
01:05:25.40 --> 01:05:30.52 don't don't eat donuts anymore stop just stop eating those get rid of that sugar sweetness
01:05:30.52 --> 01:05:37.72 craving thing yeah and then just keep making your diet cleaner and cleaner as time goes by
01:05:38.92 --> 01:05:48.12 so that's what I think is there any time that it's good because sometimes I think it's good when
01:05:48.12 --> 01:05:55.96 people do go like alright man I'm doing yeah like I whatever happened they went up the staircase and they
01:05:55.96 --> 01:06:03.08 they got all tired and they said you know what I'm done yeah it starts tomorrow but I think in
01:06:03.08 --> 01:06:09.24 those cases most of the time who was it who was it that we were talking to talking to someone
01:06:09.24 --> 01:06:14.36 someone that they are I was talking to someone that their first thing they tried to do they
01:06:14.36 --> 01:06:21.24 couldn't do it all like they tried to run three miles and they were like you know what can't do it
01:06:21.24 --> 01:06:25.80 can't run three miles oh might have been that guy there's a guy that's losing a bunch of
01:06:25.80 --> 01:06:31.96 weight on the interwebs oh yeah that's what I think he's down in Texas but he's trying to lose a lot
01:06:31.96 --> 01:06:39.08 of weight and your first time we went try to go for run didn't happen didn't happen so he had to
01:06:39.08 --> 01:06:48.36 just run less or he had to just walk actually so yeah you start with what you can do but there
01:06:48.36 --> 01:06:55.80 is a little bit of there is there is I would try I would say this keep this one in the in the back of
01:06:55.80 --> 01:07:01.40 your mind there is the whole thing of like you know what I'm changing my life right now you go home
01:07:01.40 --> 01:07:05.64 you get the garbage can out you bring it into the kitchen you throw away the twinkies you throw away
01:07:05.64 --> 01:07:11.56 the pop-tarts you throw away the the you pour the the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the
01:07:11.56 --> 01:07:17.64 path and you just don't look back yeah that's a good thing to do too yeah but again if that person's
01:07:17.64 --> 01:07:24.92 300 pounds they're not gonna be able to do I mean they're gonna push themselves yeah they could
01:07:24.92 --> 01:07:30.52 push themselves too hard so you just gotta be careful yeah so and that it's funny when um when I'm
01:07:30.52 --> 01:07:36.44 kind of looking at the question I'm like well obviously you want to start slow right obviously but then
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.84 I don't know you hear about these guys just like how you said they just they throw everything away
01:07:40.84 --> 01:07:45.48 they're like I'm a different person right I think I think we're we're crossing streams here
01:07:45.48 --> 01:07:52.44 are I am there's diet and then there's like workout yeah because diet you can pretty much go
01:07:52.44 --> 01:07:58.28 cold turkey today yeah it lets and you may or may not be able to relate to this but if you go
01:07:58.28 --> 01:08:04.60 straight extreme on your diet like all of a sudden you're hit with these the byproducts of
01:08:04.60 --> 01:08:09.56 changing your diet especially if you if you'd like like mountain do every single day
01:08:09.56 --> 01:08:13.80 right and you just all of a sudden boom stop drinking month you'll go through stuff that you
01:08:13.80 --> 01:08:18.12 might not expect like the craving will hit you so hard and then you're gonna be on free and
01:08:18.12 --> 01:08:24.60 minimal doses of mountain you know yeah basically basically I'm gonna say no stop drinking
01:08:24.60 --> 01:08:28.52 mountain you don't need it and I think and you're gonna go through withdrawals right yeah
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:33.08 if you're caffeine withdrawals and sugar withdrawals you're gonna get the the keto flu and
01:08:33.08 --> 01:08:36.92 all those things are gonna happen and it's gonna be rough but yeah but don't just say it like
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:41.16 that it's gonna be rough but that's all good bro seriously if you go into that and you experience
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:45.56 these types of things and then it's gonna apply to everything by the way any big change that you
01:08:45.56 --> 01:08:49.24 make where you you have to deprive yourself of these bad things that you've become kind of addicted to
01:08:49.24 --> 01:08:53.88 whatever you're gonna go through all kinds of changes and that goes for workout too by the way
01:08:53.88 --> 01:08:58.12 because like just the sornus alone oh dang I want to expect in the sornus oh I'm like
01:08:58.52 --> 01:09:03.000 tired now because the workout like was kind of hard it's like oh shit I wasn't expecting that I was
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.08 expecting to feel right after my workout everyone says whatever so you're gonna run into all
01:09:07.08 --> 01:09:10.68 these little things that don't tell you about and then it's like well I didn't sign up for that
01:09:10.68 --> 01:09:14.76 little part of it and then when I'm that little part and then you're gonna follow up I think the diet thing
01:09:14.76 --> 01:09:19.000 I think you're wrong I think the diet thing I think if you're I think it's very I think it's
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.96 easier in fact to just be like I'm done it's not like okay you know what I'm only gonna
01:09:23.96 --> 01:09:30.20 get a quarter bag of cheetos a day from now on I don't think that works I think you got to be like
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:37.000 no no no no no cheat us not no cheat us in my house but I do think that you could work out so hard
01:09:37.72 --> 01:09:42.36 that you're so sore that you that you say oh man I'm just too kind of like the
01:09:42.36 --> 01:09:45.56 Gigi into question earlier on like you could be what if someone's so sore that they can't do
01:09:45.56 --> 01:09:53.40 their job right and they're just sore all day at work well that's not cool so I think for diet
01:09:53.40 --> 01:10:00.76 you can you can go cold turkey or actually cold steak or hot steak and then I think for working
01:10:00.76 --> 01:10:07.88 out is the one you you you you figure out what you can do and you push a little bit harder but you
01:10:07.88 --> 01:10:13.96 don't go level nine maximum destruction madness I think you're wrong respectfully and which part do you
01:10:13.96 --> 01:10:20.36 think I'm wrong on diet I think if you go extreme with your diet I think it'll work for some people
01:10:20.36 --> 01:10:25.80 for sure but depending on who you are but I think you're more if you go extreme with the diet you
01:10:25.80 --> 01:10:29.80 don't like slowly phase out of the way you know it's interesting you know it's interesting I don't
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:34.52 know if you remember I read a letter while back on the podcast about a guy that had read way
01:10:34.52 --> 01:10:42.04 the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and that guy did what you're saying he just made little
01:10:42.04 --> 01:10:48.68 changes you know he made little changes along the way so maybe it's person it's probably personality
01:10:48.68 --> 01:10:53.16 in fact let's just go ahead and say it's personality some people are going to just have to get
01:10:53.16 --> 01:10:58.20 the damn cheetos out of their house all of them yeah and some people say you know what I'm only
01:10:58.20 --> 01:11:05.48 going to have this one cup full of cheetos every day yeah and even that's okay but but here's where
01:11:05.48 --> 01:11:12.36 you got to be careful you may lie to yourself and you can lie to yourself yeah you can lie to yourself
01:11:12.36 --> 01:11:17.64 and they're like you know I don't really think that that that big of a deal today if I just have two cups of cheetos
01:11:17.64 --> 01:11:23.24 yeah yeah yeah nine cups of cheetos later you know what you see and then two cups and
01:11:23.24 --> 01:11:29.56 respectfully I don't like your cheetos example why because you're like I'm going to allow myself
01:11:29.56 --> 01:11:34.20 cheat okay don't allow yourself cheetos that's not how small of a change you're going to make
01:11:34.20 --> 01:11:37.000 if you're not going to eat cheetos anymore you're not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm saying like
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.92 if you go extreme on your diet let's say you eat but but when you say what you're saying
01:11:40.92 --> 01:11:50.76 is hey I'm going to change my diet okay I used to eat every day I eat a whole bag of cheetos
01:11:52.20 --> 01:11:57.48 and now I'm only going to eat one cup of cheetos from the bag of day that's improvement it
01:11:57.48 --> 01:12:02.20 is improved and it's small improvement and if I could do that then why why is that not okay yeah
01:12:02.20 --> 01:12:06.76 okay if you choose to do that but okay now we're going into the specifics of a certain
01:12:06.76 --> 01:12:12.52 person's okay I think I would say this this is more along lines of what I'm thinking as far as
01:12:12.52 --> 01:12:16.12 specific examples if you're going to go if I'm going to eat one bag of cheetos obviously that's not
01:12:16.12 --> 01:12:22.28 all I'm eating I'm eating other stuff I'm the small change is I'm not going to eat cheetos anymore
01:12:22.28 --> 01:12:27.000 I'm going to cut out cheetos that's it I'm still not eating that good you know I'm going to cut out
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.60 cheetos or let's say I get you know drive through every day three times a day okay
01:12:34.60 --> 01:12:41.40 I won't get drive through anymore or all that's a big change not necessarily depending on
01:12:41.40 --> 01:12:46.92 what you get going from three drive through the day to zero the house that not a big chance it's a big
01:12:46.92 --> 01:12:50.92 child is going from like and there's certain people actually I was talking to someone
01:12:50.92 --> 01:12:59.24 the other day that had lost 150 pounds of female and it was interesting her nutritionist
01:12:59.24 --> 01:13:05.08 she hired an nutritionist and the nutritionist said okay what are the foods you can't live without
01:13:05.72 --> 01:13:10.76 and we'll work around those yeah that's pretty cool thank you and what she said was I need cheese
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:16.92 burgers and fries so then what she got told was something along lines of okay you can have cheese
01:13:16.92 --> 01:13:24.68 burger and fries on Friday yeah yeah instead of you know this this whole thing of I can never eat it
01:13:24.68 --> 01:13:30.28 now what I'm saying is there are people and I think I'm one of these people where it's like oh
01:13:30.28 --> 01:13:34.60 if I have cheeseburgers and fries today well then I might as well just get a mint chocolate chip milkshake
01:13:34.60 --> 01:13:41.16 with it and if I did that tonight then you know what tomorrow morning hey after you get done training
01:13:41.16 --> 01:13:45.24 maybe you know that cheeseburgers good yesterday I've had so maybe it's my own personal weakness
01:13:45.88 --> 01:13:51.000 but for me I'd prefer to be just like on the path yeah yeah that's why the 80 20 rule
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.48 and I talked about this in the field manual the 80 20 rule maybe it works for some people and I guess it
01:13:55.48 --> 01:14:02.20 does work for me but I'd rather just be straight on the program you know what I mean yeah and and then
01:14:02.20 --> 01:14:06.76 and you know what you know Tim Ferriss has that thing where or he's talked about that thing where he goes
01:14:07.48 --> 01:14:15.32 six days hardcore strict and then the seventh day you literally eat whatever you want as much as you can
01:14:15.32 --> 01:14:24.28 and I even tried that I have and it's really really good because you feel really really good not
01:14:24.28 --> 01:14:29.72 and it's only physically but just about the whole I'm on the program and you kind of know and on that
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:34.36 on that cheat day you do they call it the cheat day you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any
01:14:34.36 --> 01:14:40.76 guilt at all even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to become an off a real strong
01:14:40.76 --> 01:14:48.68 week to like be to feel good about cheat for three like three burgers are good too yeah and that's
01:14:48.68 --> 01:14:54.04 you've been really that bad of a cheat day a cheat day is like fries fries then you're starting to go
01:14:54.04 --> 01:14:59.88 into it for sure but the I'm like you know a cheat day cheat day like asked Tim held
01:15:00.60 --> 01:15:05.80 it'll be like for like a whole thing of donuts re box a cook yeah whatever you want straight up
01:15:05.80 --> 01:15:09.80 whatever you want this is disgusting here's the thing though with when you when you start to eat
01:15:09.80 --> 01:15:15.16 healthy and you then you try to eat a whole box of donuts you're after like one two three maybe six
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:21.48 eight donuts you're gonna be like you know you're in six donuts easy you're in six donuts in one
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:25.80 oh my gosh you know those I think they're called Intimins Old Fashion they're you know
01:15:25.80 --> 01:15:30.52 we'll know that you know little chocolate Domets you know what a total full size donut straight
01:15:30.52 --> 01:15:38.76 up they're kind of a little bigger too you know you know oh you know oh you know I can't even
01:15:38.76 --> 01:15:44.36 fat of eating six donuts ever since I started talking so much smack about donuts yeah I
01:15:44.36 --> 01:15:48.36 know I can't literally can never have when you get in my life yeah you're not allowed for sure
01:15:48.36 --> 01:15:54.36 100% yeah you know yeah even if you were like if someone was like hey just bumping
01:15:54.36 --> 01:15:58.84 in the back when I was a little kid my parents would buy the chocolate doughnuts the host's chocolate
01:15:58.84 --> 01:16:03.16 yeah that's like what we'll covered in chocolate those things are good yeah yeah yeah you can't even
01:16:03.16 --> 01:16:09.000 have one of those again no no you know I did the six day cheat program no even then okay I can't do it
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.16 you know you know the old fashion donut is right it's like a don't with the whole it right
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:19.88 no it's called old fashion donuts they're like um it's they're kind of glazed and almost like
01:16:19.88 --> 01:16:24.52 not they're not crispy but they're kind of hardy are hard and okay on the outside and then
01:16:24.52 --> 01:16:29.08 they're regular soft donuts and then they say and they have this glaze or um okay so I think it's
01:16:29.08 --> 01:16:33.72 I forget the name I think it might be vitamins but they have old fashion donuts where they're not
01:16:33.72 --> 01:16:38.20 as hard but they're kind of hard and they're just bigger anyway those are my favorite ones
01:16:38.20 --> 01:16:41.72 and I used to get chocolate milk and heat up the chocolate milk so it's like hot chocolate and
01:16:41.72 --> 01:16:47.24 donuts and oh yeah I easy money like I'll eat two bucks for those for sure oh I used to
01:16:47.24 --> 01:16:55.56 now yeah so the point there is on the cheat day you just go yeah no shame but after the things
01:16:55.56 --> 01:16:59.80 you can't just eat donuts four times a day or three you just don't feel good like your stomach
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:04.36 gets all upset and the more healthy you eat the more it's gonna be like that so the longer you're
01:17:04.36 --> 01:17:10.04 on the path you straight like if you ate some donut like the other day we went to the
01:17:10.04 --> 01:17:14.28 Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream some mid-chocolate chip ice cream was it good
01:17:14.28 --> 01:17:19.80 fine it was good but you know the kids are doing whatever's tracks the other night
01:17:19.80 --> 01:17:23.96 yeah you eat a big large double you know what after after that you're like
01:17:23.96 --> 01:17:27.64 but I don't feel right you know so unless you're just committed to eat it because I don't
01:17:27.64 --> 01:17:31.32 know you don't want to waste it or something like that you're gonna be like oh my cheat your
01:17:31.32 --> 01:17:35.88 cheat day is not gonna be that bad it's what I'm saying okay but I know you have that
01:17:35.88 --> 01:17:40.84 we don't make it happen depends on what it is yeah yeah yeah you could pump some chili fries or something
01:17:40.84 --> 01:17:49.16 I don't like chili fries all right so yeah maybe what's the verdict I think just in the like
01:17:49.16 --> 01:17:54.60 middle of the road not the whole story like same thing I said balance so you're saying balance as
01:17:54.60 --> 01:17:59.16 well I'll tell you though man if that balance doesn't work for you you're gonna have to step it up
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:04.76 you're gonna have to go hardcore I'd give yourself two weeks two weeks for a balanced approach
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:09.48 on the diet side if you can't get your shit under control in two weeks you got to go
01:18:09.48 --> 01:18:14.04 hardcore you got to get in there with a garbage client can throw away the Twinkies throw away
01:18:14.04 --> 01:18:20.52 everything else that's crap in your fridge and go hardcore and start with a fast too right
01:18:20.52 --> 01:18:26.60 you know hey a fast is awesome a fast for a good way wait I don't even know that there's that much
01:18:26.60 --> 01:18:31.96 to expect don't ever for a day if you never done it before it's not that bad of a deal there's no
01:18:31.96 --> 01:18:37.96 little stuff don't eat your day there's little there's not take you from a normal human being
01:18:37.96 --> 01:18:44.04 this little stuff that you if you're not if you go in and not prepared for it then you're like
01:18:44.04 --> 01:18:48.44 I actually think the more you think about it prepared for it the more psychologically or it is
01:18:48.44 --> 01:18:52.28 yeah just be like oh yeah you know what I woke up this morning I haven't eaten last night
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:57.32 call I'm not gonna eat until tonight every time that's a fast yes so when I'm trying to like that
01:18:57.32 --> 01:19:01.32 when I'm like I'm not gonna eat till this then I go through little stuff but if I just happen if I'm
01:19:01.32 --> 01:19:06.52 two into work I'm only drinking coffee and I forget and like dang if if I eat not having
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:11.40 an eight for like you know 12 hours 16 then I'll be like oh I'll just go another three that's my
01:19:11.40 --> 01:19:16.52 15 because like 15 right 15 hours is when your body starts to kind of shift over to like
01:19:16.52 --> 01:19:23.80 I think 15 okay so I'll just wait that shower it's like cool done but if we're playing it that's
01:19:23.80 --> 01:19:29.40 when yeah I don't know but it depends on who you are but that's like I agree with the fast off
01:19:29.40 --> 01:19:35.56 yeah I agree with a kick things off and get like jump onto the path yeah this jump on with a fast
01:19:35.56 --> 01:19:41.24 yeah hey go see your doctor whatever do you have to go see a doctor to fast 24 hours
01:19:41.24 --> 01:19:49.56 I think you should if you've been probably yeah yeah yeah yeah a fat lazy you know especially if
01:19:49.56 --> 01:19:53.40 you're older or something like that I think seen a doctor is it how old is it to get a personal trainer
01:19:55.16 --> 01:19:58.76 depends on when you need to help me the woman I just talk to she's like personal trainer
01:19:58.76 --> 01:20:05.000 and nutritionist hired them both lost 100 whatever pounds so yeah I think she was an
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.80 excessive 300 pounds yeah and when I matter she's completely normal right like you know completely
01:20:11.80 --> 01:20:16.68 like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight trouble in her life yeah that's pretty amazing yeah
01:20:16.68 --> 01:20:24.20 so hire the trainer hire the the nutritionist yeah I think so I think that helps
01:20:24.84 --> 01:20:30.44 I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like that when I can
01:20:30.44 --> 01:20:35.96 kind of look up that stuff but here's the thing I went in with this bias like because I kind
01:20:35.96 --> 01:20:40.60 of had a background in it so I'm like why would I I can just go look but I'm looking it up but I have
01:20:40.60 --> 01:20:46.04 all this other knowledge the same rule you try it for two weeks see if you can keep yourself
01:20:46.04 --> 01:20:52.92 on the path and if you can't got to bring someone in right here's what I like hire a trainer
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:57.24 but not like the kind every day it's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program
01:20:57.24 --> 01:21:03.08 yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's gonna depend on who you're straight up you don't who can keep you on
01:21:03.72 --> 01:21:09.000 yeah that's the biggest part of all this and I've said this a billion times like you know what you
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.84 need to do yeah you know what you need to do you know you know what you need to do if you can't get
01:21:14.84 --> 01:21:20.44 yourself to do it maybe you need to get someone to help you do it yeah the weird thing is like
01:21:20.44 --> 01:21:23.56 nutritionist and stuff you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like okay we're
01:21:23.56 --> 01:21:28.44 gonna put you on a low fat diet you know what you'd be really not good seeing you in the wrong
01:21:28.44 --> 01:21:31.88 there yeah I don't know how many you think there's still nutritionists that are doing that right now
01:21:31.88 --> 01:21:36.44 oh yeah there are I know there are actually there are out there so you're gonna be careful right
01:21:38.12 --> 01:21:46.20 check next question last thing that I'm not gonna draw it out but you said
01:21:46.20 --> 01:21:53.64 you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what your day would look like like
01:21:53.64 --> 01:22:00.60 if you like everything you did was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of
01:22:00.60 --> 01:22:08.92 thing well the the full the full statement is if you wrote down tonight what you were supposed to do tomorrow
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:14.44 yeah and then you did the things that you were supposed to do yeah imagine how that day would feel
01:22:14.44 --> 01:22:19.64 and imagine what you'd get done in that day yeah and then imagine if you did that every day for
01:22:19.64 --> 01:22:24.44 a week yeah and imagine if you did that every day for a month and they did it for a year and
01:22:24.44 --> 01:22:27.96 imagine where your life would be your life would be in a completely different trajectory completely
01:22:27.96 --> 01:22:32.28 completely different yeah and that's true with working out that's true with nutrition that's true
01:22:32.28 --> 01:22:37.96 with business that's true with education that's true with knowledge to with everything everything
01:22:37.96 --> 01:22:42.36 yeah kind of know what we're supposed to do yeah well I thought you were going to say
01:22:42.36 --> 01:22:44.16 some people don't know what to do.
01:22:44.16 --> 01:22:45.16 I'm not could be the case.
01:22:45.16 --> 01:22:47.44 Some people they've never worked out before.
01:22:47.44 --> 01:22:50.28 And if you're a person that's never worked out before,
01:22:50.28 --> 01:22:52.28 you probably need to bring someone into the game
01:22:52.28 --> 01:22:54.28 that's gonna help show you how to work out.
01:22:54.28 --> 01:22:58.96 If you've never done any reading about eating,
01:22:58.96 --> 01:23:01.28 and you have no idea what's gonna be good for you,
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:03.36 you're probably a person that might need to bring someone
01:23:03.36 --> 01:23:05.56 into the game to help you get over that.
01:23:05.56 --> 01:23:08.52 Yeah, and it still completely goes with exactly what you said.
01:23:08.52 --> 01:23:10.24 It's like you know what to do,
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:12.48 and even to help that, you know what not to do.
01:23:12.48 --> 01:23:14.40 Like when you're about to make decisions on me do this,
01:23:14.40 --> 01:23:16.76 or not do this, like you know which one is you should
01:23:16.76 --> 01:23:17.80 or shouldn't do.
01:23:17.80 --> 01:23:20.24 So let's say I don't know anything about working out,
01:23:20.24 --> 01:23:22.16 but I know I have to get in shape.
01:23:22.16 --> 01:23:23.000 We all know.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.44 We all know when we gotta get in shape.
01:23:24.44 --> 01:23:26.36 So then you know you gotta hire somebody.
01:23:26.36 --> 01:23:27.64 You know you gotta do something.
01:23:27.64 --> 01:23:29.32 You know that you shouldn't just be like,
01:23:29.32 --> 01:23:30.16 oh well, I'm not gonna do it.
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:31.04 I don't know, I'm not gonna do it.
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:32.36 Things to do tomorrow.
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:33.16 Yeah, the trainer.
01:23:33.16 --> 01:23:34.000 Yeah.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.16 Join a gym, get a trainer.
01:23:36.16 --> 01:23:37.56 Yeah, I don't know what to do.
01:23:37.56 --> 01:23:38.76 Okay, this is what you can do.
01:23:38.76 --> 01:23:39.84 Find out what to do.
01:23:39.84 --> 01:23:40.68 There you go.
01:23:40.68 --> 01:23:41.96 Then in that case.
01:23:41.96 --> 01:23:43.16 So you gotta make sense.
01:23:43.16 --> 01:23:45.80 Sometimes when you put things in, just say stuff,
01:23:45.80 --> 01:23:47.08 just put it on the table.
01:23:47.08 --> 01:23:48.32 Just starts to make sense.
01:23:48.32 --> 01:23:49.48 Mm-hmm.
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:50.64 Next question.
01:23:50.64 --> 01:23:52.88 I'm a veteran of the infantry,
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:55.80 and when I took over a fire team
01:23:55.80 --> 01:23:57.72 for the first time, I made the mistake of drawing
01:23:57.72 --> 01:23:59.36 hard lines in the sand.
01:24:00.48 --> 01:24:04.04 This immediately alienated members of that team
01:24:04.04 --> 01:24:05.84 that had been together for some time.
01:24:05.84 --> 01:24:08.48 I did not make that mistake again,
01:24:08.48 --> 01:24:11.40 and I definitely learned from my experience.
01:24:11.40 --> 01:24:13.60 So clearly there's not a question there.
01:24:13.60 --> 01:24:14.44 Yeah.
01:24:14.44 --> 01:24:17.60 And I forget pulling this out from,
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:19.96 I get a lot of emails and messages and all that,
01:24:19.96 --> 01:24:23.32 but I thought it was a good point to bring up
01:24:23.32 --> 01:24:28.32 to say, this idea of drawing hard lines in the sand,
01:24:28.32 --> 01:24:31.08 and what that does to your leadership position.
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:33.08 It's difficult.
01:24:33.08 --> 01:24:34.76 It's usually not a good thing to do.
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:36.68 If you draw a lot of hard lines in the sand,
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:40.32 and eventually you realize that they're either
01:24:40.32 --> 01:24:42.96 unrealistic or people can't maintain them,
01:24:42.96 --> 01:24:45.12 you're set yourself up for failure.
01:24:45.12 --> 01:24:46.72 What is that exactly like drawing lines?
01:24:46.72 --> 01:24:48.88 So it's a no matter what.
01:24:48.88 --> 01:24:52.04 We will not go to blah blah.
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:54.80 Yeah, there's the like no matter what.
01:24:54.80 --> 01:24:58.72 We will win every single road march
01:24:58.72 --> 01:25:01.68 that we do as a fire team in this while we're here.
01:25:01.68 --> 01:25:03.52 Oh, it's training thing.
01:25:03.52 --> 01:25:04.36 Okay.
01:25:04.36 --> 01:25:05.20 Well, guess what?
01:25:05.20 --> 01:25:07.44 That's a hard field.
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:09.24 There's other, there's some other fire teams
01:25:09.24 --> 01:25:11.44 that are also want to win.
01:25:11.44 --> 01:25:13.36 And so you've drawn a hard line to say,
01:25:13.36 --> 01:25:14.92 and that's not really a good example.
01:25:17.04 --> 01:25:18.76 A good example will take no matter what.
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:21.72 We're gonna muster every morning at 4.30 in the morning.
01:25:21.72 --> 01:25:22.68 No matter what.
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:26.68 And you know, then the guys are out on patrol
01:25:26.68 --> 01:25:29.44 until 2.38 in the morning.
01:25:29.44 --> 01:25:31.56 And now the next morning, a good no matter what.
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:32.40 I say no matter what.
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.16 Well, it's not good for them.
01:25:34.16 --> 01:25:35.92 It's unrealistic.
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:37.84 So you drew a hard line in the sand
01:25:37.84 --> 01:25:39.72 and now you got to back it down.
01:25:39.72 --> 01:25:42.32 So and all you have to do is soften the statement a little bit.
01:25:42.32 --> 01:25:44.84 Hey guys, to the best of our ability, if we can,
01:25:44.84 --> 01:25:47.48 we're gonna get here every morning at 4.30 for monster.
01:25:47.48 --> 01:25:51.48 There's a little, there's a little room to play there, right?
01:25:51.48 --> 01:25:53.52 And that's, that's fine.
01:25:53.52 --> 01:25:58.52 So again, there's, there's not a lot of,
01:25:58.68 --> 01:25:59.84 there's not a question here.
01:25:59.84 --> 01:26:01.80 But one of the reasons I think that,
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:06.24 that I wanted to talk about it was because I think people look at me.
01:26:06.24 --> 01:26:07.24 Yeah.
01:26:07.24 --> 01:26:10.44 And even hear me on a peripheral level.
01:26:10.44 --> 01:26:12.24 And they think all, I bet, John,
01:26:12.24 --> 01:26:14.48 would just lay down the hard lines.
01:26:14.48 --> 01:26:18.84 It's my way or the highway, right?
01:26:18.84 --> 01:26:19.84 Yeah.
01:26:19.84 --> 01:26:23.32 And the, the opposite is actually true.
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:29.04 And the reason that I came to that conclusion
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:32.84 was because I worked for leaders like that
01:26:32.84 --> 01:26:35.68 and I hated working for leaders like that.
01:26:35.68 --> 01:26:38.72 So I tried to never be a leader like that.
01:26:41.36 --> 01:26:44.12 And there's a dichotomy, right?
01:26:44.12 --> 01:26:46.16 There's a huge dichotomy.
01:26:46.16 --> 01:26:49.84 Because this doesn't mean that you're not driving and pushing.
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:51.20 This doesn't mean that you're not saying,
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:52.64 hey, we're gonna be the best,
01:26:52.64 --> 01:26:55.28 whatever, we're gonna be the best task unit here.
01:26:55.28 --> 01:26:56.48 Doesn't mean you're not saying,
01:26:56.48 --> 01:26:58.24 hey, look, we're not gonna rest
01:26:58.24 --> 01:26:59.64 until we've done what we're supposed to do.
01:26:59.64 --> 01:27:00.64 Doesn't mean that.
01:27:00.64 --> 01:27:01.48 Mm.
01:27:03.12 --> 01:27:05.16 But man, you gotta find that balance.
01:27:05.16 --> 01:27:06.000 Yeah.
01:27:07.68 --> 01:27:09.28 It does feel like that with you.
01:27:10.48 --> 01:27:11.80 That you're like, it feels like that,
01:27:11.80 --> 01:27:13.20 but when you're one, I mean,
01:27:13.20 --> 01:27:15.36 my experience obviously is,
01:27:15.36 --> 01:27:19.24 we're under no extreme circumstances.
01:27:19.24 --> 01:27:20.08 Right.
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:21.000 But just like just like the simple stuff.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.72 Like it really does seem like you wake up at 430 in the morning.
01:27:23.72 --> 01:27:26.28 Every single morning, do or die.
01:27:26.28 --> 01:27:27.12 100%.
01:27:27.12 --> 01:27:27.72 That I did.
01:27:27.72 --> 01:27:28.56 That I do.
01:27:28.56 --> 01:27:31.68 Oh, unless like there's sometimes where I get home at,
01:27:31.68 --> 01:27:33.24 like I remember a little while ago,
01:27:33.24 --> 01:27:36.48 I got home at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning.
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:38.76 And that's basically my cut off zone.
01:27:38.76 --> 01:27:41.96 If I'm getting less than 4.5 hours of sleep,
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:44.40 then I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'll wake up
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:45.64 and I've been like, hey,
01:27:45.64 --> 01:27:47.96 I only got 2.5 hours of sleep last night.
01:27:47.96 --> 01:27:48.84 That's not enough.
01:27:48.84 --> 01:27:50.16 I'm going back to bed.
01:27:50.16 --> 01:27:51.56 Right, that's what I mean.
01:27:51.56 --> 01:27:53.56 Where I've tweeted that out before.
01:27:53.56 --> 01:27:55.08 Yeah, I'm the entire.
01:27:55.08 --> 01:27:56.24 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
01:27:56.24 --> 01:27:57.28 that's what I mean.
01:27:57.28 --> 01:27:57.80 Yeah.
01:27:57.80 --> 01:27:59.36 So it's like when that happens,
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:01.92 it almost like it catches you off guard, you know,
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:03.60 when you when you did that,
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:05.20 I mean, obviously not like, oh,
01:28:05.20 --> 01:28:08.36 drop cool start, it's not that feeling at all.
01:28:08.36 --> 01:28:09.80 It's just kind of like, oh, dang.
01:28:10.96 --> 01:28:13.44 You do have that flexibility when, you know,
01:28:13.44 --> 01:28:15.80 when it's the correct thing, kind of thing.
01:28:15.80 --> 01:28:17.68 Yeah, you have to.
01:28:17.68 --> 01:28:20.16 Yeah, you're not a slave to your, uh,
01:28:21.28 --> 01:28:22.12 rigidity.
01:28:22.12 --> 01:28:24.92 Well, what you're saying is I don't draw hard lines
01:28:24.92 --> 01:28:26.04 in the sand.
01:28:26.04 --> 01:28:27.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:28:27.44 --> 01:28:28.28 Really?
01:28:28.28 --> 01:28:30.12 Yes, exactly right.
01:28:30.12 --> 01:28:32.000 But it's real easy to go down the slippery slope
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.12 of like, well, you know what,
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:36.68 I actually didn't eat real good yesterday,
01:28:36.68 --> 01:28:39.000 so I probably need some more sleep to recover today.
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.60 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:28:39.60 --> 01:28:40.76 Really?
01:28:40.76 --> 01:28:43.20 Yeah, well, I am, it's a rest day.
01:28:43.20 --> 01:28:44.64 So I might as well turn on the TV.
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:46.80 You know, I'd be good with TV's maybe some popcorn.
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:48.08 Oh, you know, it'd be good with some popcorn,
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:49.76 maybe some cheese sticks.
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:51.40 And some other setups.
01:28:51.40 --> 01:28:52.92 It's a rest day, right?
01:28:52.92 --> 01:28:53.76 Yeah, yeah.
01:28:53.76 --> 01:28:56.12 I'm looking for wrong path. It's only free.
01:28:56.12 --> 01:28:56.96 It's only saying.
01:28:56.96 --> 01:29:00.04 I guess the opposite of the, of the path
01:29:00.04 --> 01:29:01.32 is the slippery slope.
01:29:01.32 --> 01:29:03.68 Exactly right.
01:29:05.84 --> 01:29:06.56 Next question.
01:29:06.56 --> 01:29:08.48 Hi, scenario.
01:29:08.48 --> 01:29:10.56 It's actually legit way to think of it, too.
01:29:10.56 --> 01:29:11.16 Yeah.
01:29:11.16 --> 01:29:13.40 If it's a legit way to think of things,
01:29:13.40 --> 01:29:16.20 if you're on the path, when you know what the path is
01:29:16.20 --> 01:29:18.04 as we talked about with Tim Ferriss,
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:20.88 if you're on the path, which you know,
01:29:21.92 --> 01:29:23.24 when you step off the path,
01:29:23.24 --> 01:29:24.48 it's a slippery slope.
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:26.60 You know, it's off the path.
01:29:26.60 --> 01:29:28.24 Is a slippery slippery slope?
01:29:28.24 --> 01:29:28.84 Yeah.
01:29:28.84 --> 01:29:29.92 What'd you just say?
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:32.16 The popcorn can lead to cheats sticks
01:29:32.16 --> 01:29:34.28 can lead to paminums.
01:29:34.28 --> 01:29:35.76 That's the slippery slope right there.
01:29:35.76 --> 01:29:36.44 Yeah.
01:29:36.44 --> 01:29:40.44 And sometimes you slip so hard that you just plunge deep.
01:29:42.56 --> 01:29:43.96 Off the path.
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.80 Yeah.
01:29:44.80 --> 01:29:45.80 Fall off the wagon land hard.
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:48.20 scenario.
01:29:48.20 --> 01:29:51.24 My team leaders boss came to me and asked my opinion
01:29:51.24 --> 01:29:54.08 on my horrible team leader.
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:56.88 Okay, the boss is boss.
01:29:56.88 --> 01:29:57.56 One of my opinions.
01:29:57.56 --> 01:29:58.56 So what do I do?
01:29:58.56 --> 01:30:01.92 Praise him to make the team look good and maintain my relationship
01:30:01.92 --> 01:30:05.52 with my with the team leader or tackfully tell the truth
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:08.08 and build a relationship with the boss with my boss's
01:30:08.08 --> 01:30:09.08 ball.
01:30:09.08 --> 01:30:09.44 Hey.
01:30:09.44 --> 01:30:10.40 That's a good question, isn't it?
01:30:10.40 --> 01:30:14.000 I think this is a really tough position to be in.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.68 Because you have to be careful and you have to be balanced.
01:30:16.68 --> 01:30:18.16 And there's a couple of things to think about.
01:30:18.16 --> 01:30:20.20 First of all, no one likes rats.
01:30:20.20 --> 01:30:20.80 Yeah.
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:21.80 Right?
01:30:21.80 --> 01:30:24.08 No one likes rats.
01:30:24.08 --> 01:30:27.36 But at the same time, you kind of also have to think about what's
01:30:27.36 --> 01:30:29.76 best for the team.
01:30:29.76 --> 01:30:32.84 On top of and kind of the opposite of no one likes rats is no one likes
01:30:32.84 --> 01:30:34.72 brown nosers.
01:30:34.72 --> 01:30:35.72 No.
01:30:35.72 --> 01:30:38.32 But at the same time, you have to build relationships up and down
01:30:38.32 --> 01:30:39.32 the chain of command.
01:30:39.32 --> 01:30:43.12 And one of the toughest things about this and what you have to be so
01:30:43.12 --> 01:30:46.40 careful about is that you don't know what kind of relationship the
01:30:46.40 --> 01:30:48.28 boss and the team leader have.
01:30:48.28 --> 01:30:50.000 You don't know.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000 I'll one end of the spectrum.
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.60 They could be friends.
01:30:52.60 --> 01:30:55.20 So if you say something bad about them, that's going right back to the
01:30:55.20 --> 01:30:58.20 team leader and you're going to have a hard time.
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:00.56 You're in a much worse position.
01:31:00.56 --> 01:31:04.32 Also, they could be enemies.
01:31:04.32 --> 01:31:10.48 And supporting the team lead to the boss could actually make you look
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:11.48 stupid, right?
01:31:11.48 --> 01:31:15.20 Make you look bad.
01:31:15.20 --> 01:31:19.68 And it's important to say here.
01:31:19.68 --> 01:31:23.76 Is it the optics of like I don't want to look bad?
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:25.84 Is that what I'm talking about?
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:26.68 Because that's what I just said.
01:31:26.68 --> 01:31:27.68 Like it'll make you look bad.
01:31:27.68 --> 01:31:29.92 It'll make you look stupid.
01:31:29.92 --> 01:31:33.40 The reason that you're trying to look good is because you want to do a
01:31:33.40 --> 01:31:36.28 good job because you want the team because you want the mission succeed.
01:31:36.28 --> 01:31:38.68 That's what's important.
01:31:38.68 --> 01:31:39.60 And you don't care.
01:31:39.60 --> 01:31:41.92 I don't care if I have to eat crow.
01:31:41.92 --> 01:31:42.92 I don't care.
01:31:42.92 --> 01:31:46.96 So I don't mind looking bad if it's for a good reason.
01:31:46.96 --> 01:31:49.64 I don't mind my ego taking a ding if it's for the right reason.
01:31:49.64 --> 01:31:56.04 But this could actually hurt the way I do my job.
01:31:56.04 --> 01:31:59.48 Because now my boss, sorry, my boss is boss.
01:31:59.48 --> 01:32:01.36 Things I'm kind of an idiot.
01:32:01.36 --> 01:32:04.64 And so that means when comes time for promotion, even though I might be the best guy,
01:32:04.64 --> 01:32:07.96 I'm not getting promoted because I was the guy that was too blind to see that my team leader
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:10.56 wasn't idiot.
01:32:10.56 --> 01:32:19.36 So I would be very careful and fairly neutral in what I said, especially to start with,
01:32:19.36 --> 01:32:20.36 right?
01:32:20.36 --> 01:32:24.64 So if the boss says, hey, how's that team leader doing?
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:28.000 My response to be like, oh, you know what we get the job done.
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.88 There's that's so non-committal, right?
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:32.96 What about the team leader?
01:32:32.96 --> 01:32:34.68 Is he a good leader?
01:32:34.68 --> 01:32:38.32 I think he's, I think he's got a pretty good hold of what's going on.
01:32:38.32 --> 01:32:41.68 So that's, there's room to interpret that in any direction.
01:32:41.68 --> 01:32:42.68 Really?
01:32:42.68 --> 01:32:44.000 I think he's got a pretty good hold.
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.36 I think he's getting a hold of what's going on.
01:32:47.36 --> 01:32:52.80 Or another one would be, well, hey, how's your team leader?
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:56.84 I think our performance kind of shows where we're at, right?
01:32:56.84 --> 01:32:59.16 So you're not, you're not giving away.
01:32:59.16 --> 01:33:02.96 And those are, those, like I said, those are subtle and those are very open things that
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:04.56 you could respond to.
01:33:04.56 --> 01:33:12.18 And I think the more your boss probes or the, sorry, the more the team boss team leader's
01:33:12.18 --> 01:33:14.84 boss is probes.
01:33:14.84 --> 01:33:18.64 The more you could open up a little bit still with caution.
01:33:18.64 --> 01:33:25.52 But as you see what the boss's opinion is, you could open up a little bit more and share
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:28.28 a little bit more of the truth very tactfully.
01:33:28.28 --> 01:33:32.60 Or if, or you could go in the other direction, right?
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:34.60 If you just, oh, you know, that's my best guy.
01:33:34.60 --> 01:33:36.40 And I've known Bill forever.
01:33:36.40 --> 01:33:41.20 Yeah, Bill's, I brought him here and Bill's going to be, he's going to play.
01:33:41.20 --> 01:33:43.96 So are you going to derail that guy?
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:48.24 You can, but you're probably going to derail yourself too, because that guy has a legitimate
01:33:48.24 --> 01:33:51.48 relationship with him.
01:33:51.48 --> 01:33:55.80 So that's a tough situation.
01:33:55.80 --> 01:34:01.000 And I would say the best thing to do in this situation is remain as neutral as possible.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.68 And again, you know what, there's, there's someone that's listening, or to this right now,
01:34:04.68 --> 01:34:07.72 let's go in, oh, Joc was kind of a, Joc was kind of a whim.
01:34:07.72 --> 01:34:09.80 And if I was there, I'd just tell the truth.
01:34:09.80 --> 01:34:11.44 Okay, so let's, let's talk about that.
01:34:11.44 --> 01:34:12.44 Let's talk about what happens.
01:34:12.44 --> 01:34:16.44 Because I've been in that situation more times than I can count where my boss was kind
01:34:16.44 --> 01:34:17.72 of an idiot.
01:34:17.72 --> 01:34:21.16 And I get asked by his boss, hey, how's this guy doing?
01:34:21.16 --> 01:34:23.48 So let's say you rat him out.
01:34:23.48 --> 01:34:25.88 Well does that mean that the boss gets fired immediately?
01:34:25.88 --> 01:34:26.88 No.
01:34:26.88 --> 01:34:29.56 It just means that your team is less respected.
01:34:29.56 --> 01:34:32.60 It means that you get less support.
01:34:32.60 --> 01:34:38.12 It means, and if you do get rat it out by the way, where do you end up now?
01:34:38.12 --> 01:34:44.60 You end up in a bad situation where your boss knows that you ratted him out to his boss.
01:34:44.60 --> 01:34:45.60 You're hated.
01:34:45.60 --> 01:34:46.60 Yeah.
01:34:46.60 --> 01:34:47.60 You're hated.
01:34:47.60 --> 01:34:49.60 So I want to win.
01:34:49.60 --> 01:34:50.60 Let's go back to that point.
01:34:50.60 --> 01:34:51.60 I want to win.
01:34:51.60 --> 01:34:55.52 So does it help me win if I rat out my boss?
01:34:55.52 --> 01:34:57.68 Or if I rat out my team leader to my boss?
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:01.24 Does it help me win?
01:35:01.24 --> 01:35:07.60 It could, it could if your boss happens to be completely aligned with what you're thinking.
01:35:07.60 --> 01:35:10.04 He also happens to have a replacement ready.
01:35:10.04 --> 01:35:11.36 That's more squared away.
01:35:11.36 --> 01:35:12.36 That's another thing.
01:35:12.36 --> 01:35:13.68 You get rid of one bad team leader.
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:15.12 Now you get a new team leader.
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:16.12 How do you know him?
01:35:16.12 --> 01:35:17.12 Who's that?
01:35:17.12 --> 01:35:19.04 Who is that person?
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:20.04 Where did they come from?
01:35:20.04 --> 01:35:21.80 The devil's, what is that saying?
01:35:21.80 --> 01:35:25.72 The devil you know is better than the devil that you don't know.
01:35:25.72 --> 01:35:30.12 So if I have a team leader that's not doing a good job, who's fault is that?
01:35:30.12 --> 01:35:31.68 Why?
01:35:31.68 --> 01:35:32.84 Yeah.
01:35:32.84 --> 01:35:34.52 I can help my team leader.
01:35:34.52 --> 01:35:36.88 Especially if my team leader is weak, I can help them become strong.
01:35:36.88 --> 01:35:38.28 I can help teach them.
01:35:38.28 --> 01:35:40.64 Taxfully, not stepping on their toes.
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:46.08 I would rather than rat my team leader out of the chain of command, I would rather fix my
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:47.44 team leader.
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:52.000 I would rather help my team leader become better, support them.
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.92 And by the way, when you do support your team leader and they become better and now they
01:35:55.92 --> 01:35:59.64 do come up for promotion, what do they know in the back of their mind?
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:00.96 They know that you helped them.
01:36:00.96 --> 01:36:02.12 They knew that you got them there.
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:03.84 Guess who's getting promoted now.
01:36:03.84 --> 01:36:04.84 You are.
01:36:04.84 --> 01:36:06.56 Now why am I so concerned about getting promoted?
01:36:06.56 --> 01:36:09.16 Because I want to want to out do everyone else?
01:36:09.16 --> 01:36:10.52 No, that's not why.
01:36:10.52 --> 01:36:12.32 Because I want to win.
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:14.52 I want the team to win.
01:36:14.52 --> 01:36:17.04 And if I thought that you echo would do a better job.
01:36:17.04 --> 01:36:20.28 If you became team leader instead of me, I'd be like, hey, I appreciate it.
01:36:20.28 --> 01:36:21.84 But echo would do a better job than me.
01:36:21.84 --> 01:36:24.80 He should be the team leader.
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:30.88 So and also, if you're really, this is what happens.
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:33.96 If I'm really a person, this is this is what I'm getting at.
01:36:33.96 --> 01:36:36.52 If I'm really a person that really wants to get promoted, and that's my main goal.
01:36:36.52 --> 01:36:37.52 I want to get promoted.
01:36:37.52 --> 01:36:38.52 That's my goal.
01:36:38.52 --> 01:36:40.52 What do I do with the team leader?
01:36:40.52 --> 01:36:43.84 I throw him under the bus.
01:36:43.84 --> 01:36:46.40 So that's the person that we all hate.
01:36:46.40 --> 01:36:51.80 The person that rats out the team leader that says, oh, that guy's doing a terrible job.
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:53.80 I do much better job and gets that guy fired.
01:36:53.80 --> 01:36:54.80 Now I get promoted.
01:36:54.80 --> 01:36:56.24 What do we all think of him?
01:36:56.24 --> 01:36:59.04 We all think that guy's a turd.
01:36:59.04 --> 01:37:01.60 Now as opposed to the sum of that says, you know what?
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:03.92 Our team leader's weak needs help.
01:37:03.92 --> 01:37:05.88 Need support.
01:37:05.88 --> 01:37:06.88 I'm going to help him.
01:37:06.88 --> 01:37:07.88 I'm going to support him.
01:37:07.88 --> 01:37:09.08 I'm going to do the best I can.
01:37:09.08 --> 01:37:10.48 Wait, are you saying to tell the boss this?
01:37:10.48 --> 01:37:12.48 No, it's just having that out of you to have that attitude.
01:37:12.48 --> 01:37:14.48 Like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to film one of the bus.
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:20.76 Now if we have a guy that's horrible, that's tyrannical, that does a horrible job,
01:37:20.76 --> 01:37:25.28 that abuses people, then we get to a situation where you say, you know what, boss?
01:37:25.28 --> 01:37:26.96 There's some problems.
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:31.64 So if you have that one, which doesn't really, well, this guy says horrible team leader.
01:37:31.64 --> 01:37:38.12 So if this is a horrible team leader, that's irredeemable, irredeemable qualities, and it's
01:37:38.12 --> 01:37:42.16 negatively affecting the team, because he kind of makes it sound like, make the team look
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:43.16 good.
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:45.52 So there's, there's still a possibility that the team is doing okay.
01:37:45.52 --> 01:37:48.12 You know, they have a horrible leader because they are good, such good troops.
01:37:48.12 --> 01:37:49.52 I would see that sometimes.
01:37:49.52 --> 01:37:53.48 The platoon has a bad leader, but there's great guys in there.
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:56.04 And the platoon leader is smart enough just to be like, okay, I'm going to let them kind
01:37:56.04 --> 01:37:57.04 of run with it.
01:37:57.04 --> 01:37:59.04 They'll be successful.
01:37:59.04 --> 01:38:00.04 Yeah.
01:38:00.04 --> 01:38:06.16 So my goal, usually, is to help the person above me and the chate, well, it's always
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:08.36 to help the person above me and chate, come on.
01:38:08.36 --> 01:38:12.72 Can you get to a situation where someone is so bad that it's negatively affecting the
01:38:12.72 --> 01:38:16.28 whole team and you can't win because they're positioned?
01:38:16.28 --> 01:38:19.64 Yes, well, then you need to step up and do something about it and say something about
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:20.64 it.
01:38:20.64 --> 01:38:23.56 Do it tactfully, do it slowly.
01:38:23.56 --> 01:38:28.36 Don't overcommit to your statements early on, because if you do, you might say something
01:38:28.36 --> 01:38:31.40 that is out of line.
01:38:31.40 --> 01:38:34.48 So that's, it's a tricky situation.
01:38:34.48 --> 01:38:36.44 There's no definitive answer.
01:38:36.44 --> 01:38:39.16 You have to weigh these things out.
01:38:39.16 --> 01:38:43.16 Generally, if you can help someone win, you're going to win.
01:38:43.16 --> 01:38:45.80 Generally, if you help someone win, you're going to win.
01:38:45.80 --> 01:38:51.56 If it's so bad that they're just bringing down the whole team and you cannot win with them
01:38:51.56 --> 01:38:54.60 in that position, you might need to say something.
01:38:54.60 --> 01:38:57.76 Yeah, especially if everyone on the team kind of feels the same way.
01:38:57.76 --> 01:39:01.84 It's going to be a little bit easier to be like, hey, you know, and be straight.
01:39:01.84 --> 01:39:07.76 But even if everyone, if we have the gang mentality, like, hey, man, the boss sucks, you
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:08.76 know what?
01:39:08.76 --> 01:39:10.44 He's team leaders horrible.
01:39:10.44 --> 01:39:11.84 He doesn't know what he's doing.
01:39:11.84 --> 01:39:13.08 Hey, guys, you know what?
01:39:13.08 --> 01:39:17.08 We can sit here and complain about it or we could actually try and make him a better leader.
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:18.08 Yeah, yeah.
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:19.76 What do you guys say at think of that?
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:23.08 And then, because hey, we could try and get a replacement form, but at least he listens
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:24.08 to us right now.
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:25.08 Yeah.
01:39:25.08 --> 01:39:26.08 Or whatever.
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:27.08 You know, at least he, at least he understands the job.
01:39:27.08 --> 01:39:29.48 Hey, let's try and, let's try and prop him up.
01:39:29.48 --> 01:39:32.68 Let's try and get, we know what, let's get rid of him, but let's get rid of him by teaching
01:39:32.68 --> 01:39:33.68 him a lot.
01:39:33.68 --> 01:39:36.48 So he gets educated so he can move on to get promoted and then we'll have a good relationship
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:37.48 with him.
01:39:37.48 --> 01:39:38.48 Yeah.
01:39:38.48 --> 01:39:40.80 And then the team will get more support and then we can do our mission better.
01:39:40.80 --> 01:39:41.80 Yeah.
01:39:41.80 --> 01:39:42.80 Yeah.
01:39:42.80 --> 01:39:46.40 I guess he kind of doesn't understand what makes them a quote unquote horrible for sure.
01:39:46.40 --> 01:39:47.40 For sure.
01:39:47.40 --> 01:39:48.40 For sure.
01:39:48.40 --> 01:39:49.40 Like, what if I don't like him?
01:39:49.40 --> 01:39:50.40 Cause I don't like his tie.
01:39:50.40 --> 01:39:51.40 I don't know.
01:39:51.40 --> 01:39:52.40 I don't like his hair do.
01:39:52.40 --> 01:39:53.40 You know, I just don't like him.
01:39:53.40 --> 01:39:54.40 We don't, we don't come from the same side of the tracks.
01:39:54.40 --> 01:39:55.40 I don't know.
01:39:55.40 --> 01:40:00.80 I mean, one of the things that would be like if the guy's arrogant, the guy's arrogant,
01:40:00.80 --> 01:40:02.72 well, how are we going to bring him down?
01:40:02.72 --> 01:40:06.68 How are we going to bring, well, how are we not not bring him down like bring him down
01:40:06.68 --> 01:40:09.72 from his job, but how are we going to bring down his ego?
01:40:09.72 --> 01:40:11.72 How are we going to mellow him out?
01:40:11.72 --> 01:40:14.64 And that could be a long project.
01:40:14.64 --> 01:40:16.40 That could be a long project.
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:17.40 Yeah.
01:40:17.40 --> 01:40:22.04 So it's like, you say, is it damaging the performance kind of thing?
01:40:22.04 --> 01:40:23.04 Yes.
01:40:23.04 --> 01:40:24.04 That's the most important thing.
01:40:24.04 --> 01:40:25.92 Is that what is our performance like?
01:40:25.92 --> 01:40:26.92 Yeah.
01:40:26.92 --> 01:40:29.92 Can we bring this guy around?
01:40:29.92 --> 01:40:30.92 Good question.
01:40:30.92 --> 01:40:31.92 I'm sorry.
01:40:31.92 --> 01:40:39.12 There's no definitive answer, but at the same time, there's leadership is an art.
01:40:39.12 --> 01:40:40.36 Yeah.
01:40:40.36 --> 01:40:42.80 And why did the, it's an art and science?
01:40:42.80 --> 01:40:43.80 But it's an art.
01:40:43.80 --> 01:40:44.80 Sure.
01:40:44.80 --> 01:40:46.96 This is a case where the artistic part is going to be more important.
01:40:46.96 --> 01:40:47.96 Yeah.
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:48.96 Yeah.
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:49.96 The dichotomy.
01:40:49.96 --> 01:40:50.96 Art and science.
01:40:50.96 --> 01:40:53.96 And what I'm blood sport, how we called martial arts, martial science.
01:40:53.96 --> 01:40:57.60 The guy I was in, since it's a tenaka.
01:40:57.60 --> 01:40:58.60 All right.
01:40:58.60 --> 01:40:59.60 Come on, bro.
01:40:59.60 --> 01:41:00.60 Bloods worked.
01:41:00.60 --> 01:41:01.60 Fendam.
01:41:01.60 --> 01:41:02.60 Yeah.
01:41:02.60 --> 01:41:03.60 No, I know what the movie is.
01:41:03.60 --> 01:41:04.60 Yeah.
01:41:04.60 --> 01:41:05.60 He called it martial arts.
01:41:05.60 --> 01:41:06.60 I'm sorry.
01:41:06.60 --> 01:41:07.60 I'm familiar with that.
01:41:07.60 --> 01:41:08.60 Two, two, three.
01:41:08.60 --> 01:41:09.40 Even as a kid, I thought those movies were really cheesy.
01:41:09.40 --> 01:41:10.40 Yeah.
01:41:10.40 --> 01:41:11.40 Can you see?
01:41:11.40 --> 01:41:12.80 Like, I saw a lot of MMA.
01:41:12.80 --> 01:41:17.64 Well, I guess from my age, MMA, gosh, you know, I was in the blood sport.
01:41:17.64 --> 01:41:18.64 Yeah.
01:41:18.64 --> 01:41:22.04 Even when I was a kid, I wasn't thinking blood sport was legit.
01:41:22.04 --> 01:41:23.04 I don't know why.
01:41:23.04 --> 01:41:24.04 I thought it was.
01:41:24.04 --> 01:41:26.04 None of the parts were getting.
01:41:26.04 --> 01:41:28.68 I thought Rocky, I thought Rocky was more legit.
01:41:28.68 --> 01:41:29.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:41:29.68 --> 01:41:30.68 Okay.
01:41:30.68 --> 01:41:35.12 I thought I thought that Rocky was more legit than blood sport for me.
01:41:35.12 --> 01:41:37.28 Bloods sport seemed fake.
01:41:37.28 --> 01:41:38.28 Yeah.
01:41:38.28 --> 01:41:39.28 Yeah, I guess.
01:41:39.28 --> 01:41:40.28 Right.
01:41:40.28 --> 01:41:41.68 It just seemed extreme, I guess.
01:41:41.68 --> 01:41:45.32 Because plus, I think with bloods sport, the rumors circulated, the tech I was
01:41:45.32 --> 01:41:46.32 real.
01:41:46.32 --> 01:41:47.32 That was real.
01:41:47.32 --> 01:41:48.32 You know?
01:41:48.32 --> 01:41:49.32 You're like, oh, you're sure it's a movie cool.
01:41:49.32 --> 01:41:51.32 Made fun, but it was real, you know.
01:41:51.32 --> 01:41:52.32 Yeah.
01:41:52.32 --> 01:41:53.32 I, I, I, yeah.
01:41:53.32 --> 01:41:58.88 Again, I, I wouldn't say I hated bloods sport, but like I haven't seen it enough to know
01:41:58.88 --> 01:42:01.56 that the guy referred to martial arts as martial science.
01:42:01.56 --> 01:42:06.12 That was early, early in the movie when the Vendam's teacher.
01:42:06.12 --> 01:42:07.96 You know what's your typical movie, right?
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:10.36 There's a, there's a guy.
01:42:10.36 --> 01:42:12.16 He's getting beat down or whatever.
01:42:12.16 --> 01:42:14.20 He goes through his training process.
01:42:14.20 --> 01:42:15.80 There's a, there's a montage.
01:42:15.80 --> 01:42:16.80 Yeah.
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:19.84 Like in a, like in a team of, team of America, world police.
01:42:19.84 --> 01:42:23.52 There's a montage training montage and then he comes back and wins.
01:42:23.52 --> 01:42:25.76 There's, there's like most of your fight movies.
01:42:25.76 --> 01:42:26.76 Yeah.
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:27.76 You know?
01:42:27.76 --> 01:42:28.76 The montage.
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:29.76 Yeah.
01:42:29.76 --> 01:42:30.76 He gets beat down early.
01:42:30.76 --> 01:42:31.76 You know, he trains.
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:32.76 He becomes awesome.
01:42:32.76 --> 01:42:35.16 But then there's the art enemy who's trained to, but still a bully.
01:42:35.16 --> 01:42:36.40 And he has to beat him.
01:42:36.40 --> 01:42:37.60 Same thing with credit kid.
01:42:37.60 --> 01:42:39.16 But you're leaving out the montage part.
01:42:39.16 --> 01:42:40.16 Yeah.
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:42.40 The training montage, which is very important.
01:42:42.40 --> 01:42:43.40 You're the best.
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:45.76 Or, no, that's credit kid.
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:48.16 You've ever seen the movie never back down.
01:42:48.16 --> 01:42:49.16 No.
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:50.64 So you wouldn't, you'll never watch this movie.
01:42:50.64 --> 01:42:53.48 It's, it's, it's MMA, right?
01:42:53.48 --> 01:42:54.48 It's MMA.
01:42:54.48 --> 01:42:55.48 It's MMA.
01:42:55.48 --> 01:42:56.48 It's, it's MMA.
01:42:56.48 --> 01:42:57.48 Yeah.
01:42:57.48 --> 01:42:58.48 But it's just basically credit kid.
01:42:58.48 --> 01:43:03.18 It's literally like, credit kid, but just MMA now, and a little bit more cheesy.
01:43:03.18 --> 01:43:04.18 Maybe a lot more cheesy.
01:43:04.18 --> 01:43:05.18 I thought it was good though.
01:43:05.18 --> 01:43:06.18 I enjoyed it.
01:43:06.18 --> 01:43:07.18 I watched it more.
01:43:07.18 --> 01:43:09.52 I was able to learn from like a master, GJ2 guy or something.
01:43:09.52 --> 01:43:12.68 Yeah, Brazilian guy who, he is played by an African guy.
01:43:12.68 --> 01:43:14.96 The guy on, you know, remember, gladiator.
01:43:14.96 --> 01:43:15.92 You know, gladiator, right?
01:43:15.92 --> 01:43:16.92 Russell Crowe.
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:17.92 Yeah.
01:43:17.92 --> 01:43:18.92 And the black guy.
01:43:18.92 --> 01:43:21.36 Yeah, he, you know, the one.
01:43:21.36 --> 01:43:22.36 Yeah, his main friend.
01:43:22.36 --> 01:43:24.36 He's the guy, but he's Brazilian guy.
01:43:24.36 --> 01:43:25.36 Oh, okay.
01:43:25.36 --> 01:43:26.96 It doesn't match because he's on the Brazilian accent.
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:29.36 I was gonna say, how's his portrait Gj Sachsen?
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:30.36 No.
01:43:30.36 --> 01:43:31.36 It's still African.
01:43:31.36 --> 01:43:36.84 But, nonetheless, you know, on paper it might seem cool, but it came up kind of cheesy.
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:37.84 I liked it though.
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:41.28 You know, they're over emphasize like all the things like he goes to the party and
01:43:41.28 --> 01:43:43.000 the party's just crazy anyway.
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000 Yeah, look into it.
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.52 Nonetheless, yes, science and art, I dig it.
01:43:48.52 --> 01:43:52.28 You kind of have to, I mean, back in the question, yeah, I have to kind of wonder why
01:43:52.28 --> 01:43:54.40 the boss is asking your opinion, too.
01:43:54.40 --> 01:43:56.08 Is it just a general probe?
01:43:56.08 --> 01:43:57.08 Like, hey, how you guys doing?
01:43:57.08 --> 01:43:58.08 How's the boss doing?
01:43:58.08 --> 01:43:59.08 Kind of like that?
01:43:59.08 --> 01:44:03.80 Or is it, we have some concerns about your team leader, what up, you know, kind of
01:44:03.80 --> 01:44:04.80 think.
01:44:04.80 --> 01:44:08.64 Yeah, and even that, you got to be careful because they could lead you down that path.
01:44:08.64 --> 01:44:09.64 Trump.
01:44:09.64 --> 01:44:10.64 Maybe they're probing you.
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:12.84 Maybe, yeah, maybe the team leader said, hey, you know what?
01:44:12.84 --> 01:44:13.84 I don't trust this guy.
01:44:13.84 --> 01:44:16.000 Yeah, you see what he says about me, right?
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.20 And then you go in and you go, hey, you're, first,
01:44:18.20 --> 01:44:20.12 bad things about this guy, what do you think of them?
01:44:20.12 --> 01:44:21.56 Yeah, you tell you what you're right.
01:44:21.56 --> 01:44:22.76 Now guys, it's dirt.
01:44:22.76 --> 01:44:24.76 Yeah, it's dirt with ears.
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:28.88 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:44:28.88 --> 01:44:29.88 You guys, you just, yeah.
01:44:29.88 --> 01:44:31.60 Yeah, a lot of team guys say dirt.
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:32.60 Yeah, yeah.
01:44:32.60 --> 01:44:35.08 I think I think it came from Buds at some point.
01:44:35.08 --> 01:44:39.08 Yes, it was, you'd get called turds quite a bit.
01:44:39.08 --> 01:44:45.08 And then a person that was kind of maybe just not a very good individual would
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:49.84 be a turd years.
01:44:49.84 --> 01:44:50.84 Never heard that one.
01:44:50.84 --> 01:44:52.48 In Hawaii, they say, do do boy.
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:53.48 Same thing.
01:44:53.48 --> 01:44:54.48 Do do boy?
01:44:54.48 --> 01:44:55.48 Do do boy.
01:44:55.48 --> 01:44:58.72 But obviously not in any kind of discipline setting.
01:44:58.72 --> 01:45:01.16 We're here one more question.
01:45:01.16 --> 01:45:03.20 Yes, next question.
01:45:03.20 --> 01:45:04.20 Last question.
01:45:04.20 --> 01:45:05.20 Jockel.
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:09.16 I've been disciplined, working hard, and staying focused.
01:45:09.16 --> 01:45:16.16 But I've hit a run of bad luck, and I can't seem to get a break.
01:45:16.16 --> 01:45:24.28 Well, first of all, you are lucky.
01:45:24.28 --> 01:45:31.08 Because if you're capable of working hard, then that's a blessing.
01:45:31.08 --> 01:45:33.72 That's luck.
01:45:33.72 --> 01:45:40.48 Because there's people all over the world that don't have the ability for any number of
01:45:40.48 --> 01:45:45.24 reasons, many of those reasons being just bad luck.
01:45:45.24 --> 01:45:46.80 But they can't work.
01:45:46.80 --> 01:45:53.80 So right out of the gate, you're lucky that you can get up tomorrow and you can go to work.
01:45:53.80 --> 01:45:59.12 Now, you say you can't get a break.
01:45:59.12 --> 01:46:07.40 And maybe you're getting unlucky with your career or your personal life or your business.
01:46:07.40 --> 01:46:12.84 So what are you going to do?
01:46:12.84 --> 01:46:15.68 Are you going to give up?
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:17.36 Are you going to surrender?
01:46:17.36 --> 01:46:22.72 Are you going to assume that because you didn't catch a break today, there's no way you'll
01:46:22.72 --> 01:46:29.28 catch one tomorrow or next week or next year?
01:46:29.28 --> 01:46:35.60 Are you going to leave it all the chance?
01:46:35.60 --> 01:46:43.08 Or are you going to do everything in your power to force luck your way to create opportunity
01:46:43.08 --> 01:46:50.80 to shift the hands of fate?
01:46:50.80 --> 01:46:58.20 And even then, if the break never comes, even if you roll across the finish line of life
01:46:58.20 --> 01:47:10.52 bruised and plundered and empty handed from the fight, at least you know that you went
01:47:10.52 --> 01:47:16.000 after it as hard as you could.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:23.52 Thank you, gave life everything you had.
01:47:23.52 --> 01:47:30.32 And you know in the end, you might still be unlucky.
01:47:30.32 --> 01:47:39.16 That could happen, but I would much rather be an unlucky soul that fought until the
01:47:39.16 --> 01:47:50.44 end and died with my sword in my hand than an unlucky soul that submitted.
01:47:50.44 --> 01:47:57.88 Boutdown, gave up and surrendered.
01:47:57.88 --> 01:48:06.64 So stop waiting to get lucky, stop waiting for a big break instead.
01:48:06.64 --> 01:48:08.64 Be thankful.
01:48:08.64 --> 01:48:28.32 For what you do have and go out there and fight and battle and brawl to make your own luck.
01:48:28.32 --> 01:48:36.32 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:48:36.32 --> 01:48:48.04 So echo, speaking of fighting hard, is there anything you know about that can help us
01:48:48.04 --> 01:48:49.04 stay in the fight?
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:51.08 Stand up like continue fighting hard.
01:48:51.08 --> 01:48:52.08 Check.
01:48:52.08 --> 01:48:53.08 Sure.
01:48:53.08 --> 01:48:58.92 First thing you need to do is take care of your body habitus.
01:48:58.92 --> 01:49:07.64 You use that word wrong, but body habitus is like your habitat.
01:49:07.64 --> 01:49:10.84 Take care of your body is what I meant.
01:49:10.84 --> 01:49:13.84 Including but not limited to your joints.
01:49:13.84 --> 01:49:18.32 A lot more important than I thought from the beginning or in the beginning.
01:49:18.32 --> 01:49:22.28 So how you do that is super cruel oil, jocco as super cruel oil.
01:49:22.28 --> 01:49:24.64 Jocco as cruel oil called super cruel oil.
01:49:24.64 --> 01:49:27.36 Another supplement called joint warfare.
01:49:27.36 --> 01:49:29.04 These are good for your joints.
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:30.20 Don't neglect them.
01:49:30.20 --> 01:49:31.20 That's how you stand in the fight.
01:49:31.20 --> 01:49:32.20 Straight out.
01:49:32.20 --> 01:49:35.08 Get them at originmain.com.
01:49:35.08 --> 01:49:43.72 Also you want to increase your capacity and capability in the fight physically mentally
01:49:43.72 --> 01:49:47.60 you take new product called discipline.
01:49:47.60 --> 01:49:50.12 It's called discipline.
01:49:50.12 --> 01:49:52.20 It's not discipline itself.
01:49:52.20 --> 01:49:53.20 It's called discipline.
01:49:53.20 --> 01:49:57.44 It's cognitive and physical enhancer.
01:49:57.44 --> 01:49:59.88 Force multiplier.
01:49:59.88 --> 01:50:01.72 Mental plus physical.
01:50:01.72 --> 01:50:06.44 The sum is greater than the parts.
01:50:06.44 --> 01:50:07.92 Anyway, originmain.com.
01:50:07.92 --> 01:50:08.92 That's your e-gitum.

01:50:22.16 --> 01:50:25.16 The cotton is even grow in America.
01:50:25.16 --> 01:50:27.16 That's very important.
01:50:27.16 --> 01:50:29.16 See what I did there.
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:30.88 Geese rash guards.

01:50:35.32 --> 01:50:36.32 All there.
01:50:36.32 --> 01:50:41.32 Also, or just speaking of origin, we have an immersion camp.
01:50:41.32 --> 01:50:43.76 Jiu Jitsu immersion camp.
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:47.04 All levels of Jiu Jitsu are welcome to this, by the way.
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:48.04 Rubble kids.
01:50:48.04 --> 01:50:49.04 Kids welcome to that one.
01:50:49.04 --> 01:50:50.04 I don't think so.
01:50:50.04 --> 01:50:52.12 Yeah, because something they have the capacity for kids there.
01:50:52.12 --> 01:50:53.12 Yeah.
01:50:53.12 --> 01:50:54.12 Yeah.

01:50:57.12 --> 01:50:59.12 Nonetheless, all levels.
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:01.12 Even if you don't have any Jiu Jitsu at all.
01:51:01.12 --> 01:51:06.12 In fact, last time there was a group who didn't have, well, I think it was like, some
01:51:06.12 --> 01:51:07.12 didn't have any Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:08.12 Yeah, no Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:08.12 --> 01:51:11.32 And it just came when I said, like, you know, like some of the stuff you learn.
01:51:11.32 --> 01:51:13.96 If you don't have any Jiu Jitsu, it's like, okay, that's not going to fit into my knowledge
01:51:13.96 --> 01:51:14.96 because you have no knowledge.
01:51:14.96 --> 01:51:17.40 So it's like, I don't understand this quite yet.
01:51:17.40 --> 01:51:20.40 We did the fundamentals class form.

01:51:32.76 --> 01:51:33.76 No Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:33.76 --> 01:51:34.76 No Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:34.76 --> 01:51:35.76 Yeah.
01:51:35.76 --> 01:51:36.76 For sure, all levels.
01:51:36.76 --> 01:51:38.84 And by the way, if you're a beginner, yeah, that's cool.

01:52:35.56 --> 01:52:36.56 I know that.

01:52:51.68 --> 01:52:53.44 I don't even know if you remember that.
01:52:53.44 --> 01:52:55.44 But so watching you know what you do Jeff Clark is?
01:52:55.44 --> 01:52:56.44 Yeah.

01:52:58.88 --> 01:53:00.40 He's like, hey, I want to get into kettlebells now.
01:53:00.40 --> 01:53:02.52 He's like, I'm looking at the on at once or whatever.
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:04.28 You know, asking the advice here's the thing.
01:53:04.28 --> 01:53:06.40 I'm not an expert on the kettlebells.
01:53:06.40 --> 01:53:07.56 But I do know this.
01:53:07.56 --> 01:53:09.12 Don't get nuts with them.
01:53:09.12 --> 01:53:10.96 But don't go too light either though.
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:12.36 I bought a kettlebell for my daughter.
01:53:12.36 --> 01:53:13.96 She's five now.
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:14.96 So it's just, it looks cool.
01:53:14.96 --> 01:53:17.000 It's like the one of the little 24 kilograms.
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000 No.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.76 No man, the smallest one.
01:53:22.76 --> 01:53:25.80 But when I picked that up, I'm like no matter what fitness level I'm at, this isn't
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:26.80 going to do much for me.
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:27.80 So don't go too light.
01:53:27.80 --> 01:53:28.80 This is what I'm saying.
01:53:28.80 --> 01:53:29.80 Yeah.

01:55:27.28 --> 01:55:31.28 So they don't have to listen to two and a half three hours of a whole podcast to get one lesson.
01:55:31.28 --> 01:55:33.28 One specific lesson.
01:55:33.28 --> 01:55:34.28 That's not a YouTube channel.
01:55:34.28 --> 01:55:36.28 No, no, you just made a new video.
01:55:36.28 --> 01:55:37.28 A daydia.
01:55:37.28 --> 01:55:38.28 Making more videos now.
01:55:38.28 --> 01:55:39.28 Time is running out.
01:55:39.28 --> 01:55:40.28 Time is running out.
01:55:40.28 --> 01:55:41.28 That's a good idea.
01:55:41.28 --> 01:55:42.28 That's a good idea.
01:55:42.28 --> 01:55:46.76 So I'll choose little excerpts or whatever to be like, you know what?
01:55:46.76 --> 01:55:50.52 This one to me hit harder.
01:55:50.52 --> 01:55:52.88 This little message that you said.
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:55.000 And that one was because it is one of those ones.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.20 Because you know how the old saying where it's like, yeah, we know we had to have a limited
01:55:58.20 --> 01:56:00.20 time on this earth, but we don't act like it.
01:56:00.20 --> 01:56:01.20 Yeah.
01:56:01.20 --> 01:56:02.56 And that whole thing.
01:56:02.56 --> 01:56:05.60 And really when you think about that, that's more true than I think most people
01:56:05.60 --> 01:56:06.60 realize.
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:09.20 And that's why people go through like midlife crisis.
01:56:09.20 --> 01:56:10.20 Right?
01:56:10.20 --> 01:56:11.20 You know how they hit a certain age.
01:56:11.20 --> 01:56:12.64 You're a person get a car of that.
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:14.12 Yeah, I got to get it back.
01:56:14.12 --> 01:56:15.12 I don't know.
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:16.72 It's that scrambling situation.
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:20.44 You know, you're trying to scrambling to get more in.
01:56:20.44 --> 01:56:21.56 But you know, there's going to come in time.
01:56:21.56 --> 01:56:22.56 You can't do that.
01:56:22.56 --> 01:56:26.20 There's a little old school footage in there in that video.
01:56:26.20 --> 01:56:27.20 Yeah.
01:56:27.20 --> 01:56:28.20 Two of.
01:56:28.20 --> 01:56:35.36 If you want to see me when I was, I don't know, like 13 or 14.
01:56:35.36 --> 01:56:36.36 Maybe.
01:56:36.36 --> 01:56:37.56 Yeah, I was probably 14.
01:56:37.56 --> 01:56:39.12 I'm going to guess 14.
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:40.12 Bronson's children.
01:56:40.12 --> 01:56:41.12 Bronson's children.
01:56:41.12 --> 01:56:42.12 Bronson's children.
01:56:42.12 --> 01:56:43.12 That was straight up it.
01:56:43.12 --> 01:56:44.12 You went through phases, right?
01:56:44.12 --> 01:56:45.12 Yeah.
01:56:45.12 --> 01:56:46.12 You did some great.
01:56:46.12 --> 01:56:50.12 It was hard to identify fully.
01:56:50.12 --> 01:56:52.96 The actual, because we had a bunch of different names.
01:56:52.96 --> 01:56:58.12 One of the names of the band was rage of discipline.
01:56:58.12 --> 01:56:59.12 rage of discipline.
01:56:59.12 --> 01:57:00.12 Age of discipline.
01:57:00.12 --> 01:57:01.12 It would never disciples of discipline.
01:57:01.12 --> 01:57:02.12 No.
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:03.12 That's something else.
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:04.12 Okay.
01:57:04.12 --> 01:57:05.12 A very simple discipline.
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:06.12 It was rage of discipline.
01:57:06.12 --> 01:57:09.12 And it was struggle.
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:13.88 It was lock and load, which is really militaristic for someone that wasn't in the military
01:57:13.88 --> 01:57:15.88 to be like my band called lock and load.
01:57:15.88 --> 01:57:17.88 I realized how cheesy that is now.
01:57:17.88 --> 01:57:18.88 No, that's pretty dope.
01:57:18.88 --> 01:57:20.36 No, I don't know.
01:57:20.36 --> 01:57:24.08 But anyways, rage of discipline's real military ish.
01:57:24.08 --> 01:57:25.08 See, right?
01:57:25.08 --> 01:57:26.08 You were even before.
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.72 Yeah, that's what the guy you got.
01:57:28.72 --> 01:57:30.56 The video footage from Ellison James.
01:57:30.56 --> 01:57:33.20 He when he comes on the podcast, he's like, I'm going to tell people.
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:35.20 I actually just spoiler alert.
01:57:35.20 --> 01:57:39.20 Because he said, I can't wait to tell everyone that you had a band called rage of discipline
01:57:39.20 --> 01:57:42.20 when you were 14 years old.
01:57:42.20 --> 01:57:44.20 And I was kind of laughing about that.
01:57:44.20 --> 01:57:45.20 Yeah.
01:57:45.20 --> 01:57:48.20 But you were in the making from the beginning.
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:49.20 Yeah.
01:57:49.20 --> 01:57:50.20 Yeah, I guess you could say that.
01:57:50.20 --> 01:57:56.20 But you know, also I also look back and think, well, man, I did some dumb stuff when I was a kid.
01:57:56.20 --> 01:57:57.20 Yeah.
01:57:57.20 --> 01:57:59.20 Well, you didn't get a handle on the discipline, too later.
01:57:59.20 --> 01:58:01.20 But you know, the seed was there.
01:58:01.20 --> 01:58:03.20 You know, like a little rattlesnake.
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:06.20 You know, they say they're the most dangerous because they can't control the venom.
01:58:06.20 --> 01:58:08.20 They don't have the discipline.
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:09.20 Oh, but they want the discipline.
01:58:09.20 --> 01:58:10.20 That's what I think.
01:58:10.20 --> 01:58:12.20 That's what I was like, a little rattlesnake.
01:58:12.20 --> 01:58:13.20 Yes.
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:13.20 Interesting.
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:14.20 Right.
01:58:14.20 --> 01:58:16.20 Nonetheless, you can see these videos on you.
01:58:16.20 --> 01:58:17.20 Well, the video is a cool video.
01:58:17.20 --> 01:58:18.20 Yeah.
01:58:18.20 --> 01:58:19.20 Thanks, Chuck.
01:58:19.20 --> 01:58:20.20 Good job, echo Charles.
01:58:20.20 --> 01:58:21.20 Thanks.
01:58:21.20 --> 01:58:23.20 Trying to do more videos.
01:58:23.20 --> 01:58:26.20 Also, Chuck was a store called, Jocco Store.
01:58:26.20 --> 01:58:29.20 This is where you can get discipline equals freedom shirts.
01:58:29.20 --> 01:58:32.20 There's no way to get discipline.
01:58:32.20 --> 01:58:34.20 You know, iconic one.
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:36.20 Also, rash guards on there.
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:38.20 Women's stuff on their hoodies on there.

01:59:06.20 --> 01:59:07.20 It's out.
01:59:07.20 --> 01:59:08.20 It's available.
01:59:08.20 --> 01:59:09.20 Things I didn't say anything.
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:10.20 I just kind of snuck it on there.
01:59:10.20 --> 01:59:11.20 So some people got it.
01:59:11.20 --> 01:59:12.20 So it's live.
01:59:12.20 --> 01:59:13.20 It's live.
01:59:13.20 --> 01:59:14.20 Been alive for a day.
01:59:14.20 --> 01:59:15.20 You're up to the book.
01:59:15.20 --> 01:59:16.20 Back to the book.
01:59:16.20 --> 01:59:17.20 It's actually good.
01:59:17.20 --> 01:59:19.20 A front of it has a book.
01:59:19.20 --> 01:59:22.20 On the back has all the titles that you've reviewed.
01:59:22.20 --> 01:59:23.20 Oh.
01:59:23.20 --> 01:59:24.20 It's a good one.
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:25.20 Anyway, you want to see what that looks like.
01:59:25.20 --> 01:59:26.20 JoccoStore.com.
01:59:26.20 --> 01:59:28.20 If you want something, get something.
01:59:28.20 --> 01:59:30.20 It's a good way to support.
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:32.20 Also, psychological warfare.
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:39.20 If you don't know what that is, it's an album with tracks that each track is engineered.
01:59:39.20 --> 01:59:40.20 It's not music tracks.
01:59:40.20 --> 01:59:41.20 JoccoTracts.
01:59:41.20 --> 01:59:48.20 Engineered to help you through any moment of weakness that you may stumble upon or that might stumble upon you.
01:59:48.20 --> 01:59:52.20 Actually, you shouldn't say stumble upon you because that kind of gives the ownership to like,
01:59:52.20 --> 01:59:54.20 Oh, it happens to me.
01:59:54.20 --> 01:59:55.20 You know what I mean?
01:59:55.20 --> 01:59:57.20 If you hit weakness, you hit the weakness.
01:59:57.20 --> 01:59:59.20 Like you stumbled on the weakness.
01:59:59.20 --> 02:00:00.20 You can't blame the weakness.
02:00:00.20 --> 02:00:01.20 You blame you.
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:02.20 You can't blame you.
02:00:02.20 --> 02:00:03.20 You can't blame you.
02:00:03.20 --> 02:00:07.20 So you need moment of weakness that you happen to stumble upon.
02:00:07.20 --> 02:00:10.20 There's a track for that procrastination.
02:00:10.20 --> 02:00:11.20 We can up early.
02:00:11.20 --> 02:00:13.20 The diet stuff falling off the diet.
02:00:13.20 --> 02:00:14.20 Wagon.
02:00:14.20 --> 02:00:16.20 You want to eat some donuts because they're free at work.
02:00:16.20 --> 02:00:18.20 It's wasteful if you don't eat them.
02:00:18.20 --> 02:00:21.20 It's disrespectful to the person who bought them.
02:00:21.20 --> 02:00:24.20 And you're going to eat them.
02:00:24.20 --> 02:00:26.20 That's weak.
02:00:26.20 --> 02:00:33.20 Stand the path and if you need a little spot psychological warfare, you can get it on iTunes.
02:00:33.20 --> 02:00:39.20 Amazon Music various wherever you can purchase MP3's boom, get it from their psychological
02:00:39.20 --> 02:00:40.20 or it's a good one.
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:41.20 Good way to support too.
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:42.20 By the way.
02:00:42.20 --> 02:00:43.20 Good way to support.
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:49.20 Also, if you need some more support, you can get Jocca White Tea.
02:00:49.20 --> 02:00:52.20 And I've got some bad news and good news.
02:00:52.20 --> 02:00:53.20 Bad news.
02:00:53.20 --> 02:00:56.20 They've started testing for Jocca White Tea.
02:00:56.20 --> 02:01:00.20 So they started testing their worried, you know, they see guys just dominating and they're
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:02.20 thinking they're probably on Jocca White Tea.
02:01:02.20 --> 02:01:04.20 The good thing that's a bad news.
02:01:04.20 --> 02:01:06.20 Good news is it doesn't matter.
02:01:06.20 --> 02:01:07.20 Can't test for it.
02:01:07.20 --> 02:01:08.20 All natural.
02:01:08.20 --> 02:01:09.20 It's all natural.
02:01:09.20 --> 02:01:16.20 No one can believe that a fully natural substance can raise any human beings deadlift to
02:01:16.20 --> 02:01:17.20 8,000 pound minimum.
02:01:17.20 --> 02:01:18.20 But there it is.
02:01:18.20 --> 02:01:19.20 It is factual.
02:01:19.20 --> 02:01:20.20 Factual.
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:23.20 Books.
02:01:23.20 --> 02:01:24.20 Books.

02:01:47.20 --> 02:01:49.20 That'll tell you right there.
02:01:49.20 --> 02:01:53.20 There's so many parents who said I can't believe my kid now wants to study.
02:01:53.20 --> 02:01:56.20 That's this post little pictures of kids making math flashcards.
02:01:56.20 --> 02:01:57.20 Yeah.
02:01:57.20 --> 02:01:58.20 That's what I'm talking about.
02:01:58.20 --> 02:02:02.20 Imagine if you get your kid to do math flashcards voluntarily.
02:02:02.20 --> 02:02:03.20 Boom.
02:02:03.20 --> 02:02:04.20 So that's what I'm talking about.

02:03:13.20 --> 02:03:17.20 He didn't think of this motto. I thought of the motto.
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:20.20 The motto is, stay clean.
02:03:20.20 --> 02:03:24.20 So yeah, get yourself some jocos soap.

02:04:14.20 --> 02:04:18.20 So if you want the audio version, get that.

02:04:58.20 --> 02:05:05.20 I will book on just hype and we didn't do it through paid advertising, which I don't even know if you could do it through paid advertising.
02:05:05.20 --> 02:05:07.20 The book sells because the word a mouth.
02:05:07.20 --> 02:05:12.20 So everyone that listens to this podcast buys the books, spreads the word, gets it for other people.

02:06:15.20 --> 02:06:20.20 As much as we can to accommodate more people, but I'm telling you, it's going to sell out.
02:06:20.20 --> 02:06:23.20 We're only doing two musters this year.
02:06:23.20 --> 02:06:27.20 One is in Washington, D.C., May 17th and 18th.
02:06:27.20 --> 02:06:30.20 And one is in San Francisco, October 17th and 18th.
02:06:30.20 --> 02:06:37.20 So come learn, hang out, get your pragmatic leadership skills.
02:06:37.20 --> 02:06:40.20 And also it's important to know that there's no green room.
02:06:40.20 --> 02:06:41.20 There's no backstage.
02:06:41.20 --> 02:06:47.20 We'll be there hanging out answering questions, talking, eating, working out,
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:50.20 and hanging out with everyone that shows up.
02:06:50.20 --> 02:06:52.20 So join us there.

02:07:06.20 --> 02:07:09.20 And they kind of say, what should I say up my Chanda Command?
02:07:09.20 --> 02:07:12.20 I want my Chanda Command to pay for it, which is awesome.
02:07:12.20 --> 02:07:16.20 And the Chanda Command should pay for it, because they're going to get back a much better leader
02:07:16.20 --> 02:07:17.20 in their organization.
02:07:17.20 --> 02:07:19.20 But we put a document on there.
