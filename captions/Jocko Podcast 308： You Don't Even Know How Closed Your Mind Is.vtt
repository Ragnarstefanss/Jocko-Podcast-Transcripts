00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.90
This is Jockel Podcast number three.

2
00:00:02.90 --> 00:00:05.000
Oh, eight with echo Charles and me.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.30
Jockel, we're in good evening, echo.

4
00:00:06.30 --> 00:00:07.14
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.14 --> 00:00:15.64
So tonight at long last, we are going to wrap up what has ended up being a six part series.

6
00:00:15.64 --> 00:00:18.98
I got a little out of control, didn't I?

7
00:00:18.98 --> 00:00:22.82
Well, I kind of got a little out of control this one.

8
00:00:22.82 --> 00:00:25.62
Well, how not to do it cannot be overstated?

9
00:00:25.62 --> 00:00:27.26
How not to do it cannot be overstated?

10
00:00:27.26 --> 00:00:28.30
It's explained that.

11
00:00:28.30 --> 00:00:33.76
It means like if there are little tips how not to do something, let's face it.

12
00:00:33.76 --> 00:00:35.76
The value is what it call infinite.

13
00:00:35.76 --> 00:00:36.76
It's infinite.

14
00:00:36.76 --> 00:00:38.10
Check, good point.

15
00:00:38.10 --> 00:00:40.84
The book is called on the psychology of military competence.

16
00:00:40.84 --> 00:00:45.20
We started on 303, podcast 303, 304, 305, 306, 307.

17
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:46.20
That's a lot of podcast.

18
00:00:46.20 --> 00:00:47.96
This is the winner.

19
00:00:47.96 --> 00:00:52.20
Most number of podcasts on a single book.

20
00:00:52.20 --> 00:00:53.64
If you haven't listened those, you can go back.

21
00:00:53.64 --> 00:00:56.72
I actually will say this in preparing this one.

22
00:00:56.72 --> 00:00:58.86
If you haven't listened those, you don't have to go back.

23
00:00:58.86 --> 00:01:00.16
You can listen to this one.

24
00:01:00.16 --> 00:01:05.26
There might be a couple of references, but they're not super, you'll be able to get through

25
00:01:05.26 --> 00:01:08.06
them.

26
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.86
And this section that we're about to cover kind of starts with the crux of the book.

27
00:01:11.86 --> 00:01:16.82
But again, when I started reading this book a couple of years ago, it was a couple, maybe

28
00:01:16.82 --> 00:01:17.82
a year ago.

29
00:01:17.82 --> 00:01:18.82
Maybe a couple of years ago.

30
00:01:18.82 --> 00:01:21.30
I should have forget when I got this book.

31
00:01:21.30 --> 00:01:27.68
But I knew it was going to take a while, I didn't know it was going to take this long,

32
00:01:27.68 --> 00:01:29.84
but here we are.

33
00:01:29.84 --> 00:01:31.92
I apologize for taking so long.

34
00:01:31.92 --> 00:01:41.14
Like you said, though, when you understand how not to do something and you understand what

35
00:01:41.14 --> 00:01:45.10
the pitfalls are and the mistakes you can make and the traps.

36
00:01:45.10 --> 00:01:46.38
These things are all traps.

37
00:01:46.38 --> 00:01:47.38
They're all traps.

38
00:01:47.38 --> 00:01:53.52
And when you start to be able to see the traps, it helps a person a lot.

39
00:01:53.52 --> 00:01:56.08
It doesn't make them not going to the traps.

40
00:01:56.08 --> 00:01:57.08
That's the whole point.

41
00:01:57.08 --> 00:02:01.70
That's one of the whole points of this book is people know that this is a trap and they

42
00:02:01.70 --> 00:02:02.70
walk right into it.

43
00:02:02.70 --> 00:02:04.28
They just can't even help themselves.

44
00:02:04.28 --> 00:02:06.70
Like remember the whole name dropping thing that he talked about?

45
00:02:06.70 --> 00:02:11.42
I forget which one it was, but the name dropping, everybody knows it looks whack and

46
00:02:11.42 --> 00:02:12.42
they still do it.

47
00:02:12.42 --> 00:02:14.06
They can't control themselves.

48
00:02:14.06 --> 00:02:19.46
Well, let me rephrase that, an arrogant, egotistical person that's nervous about how they

49
00:02:19.46 --> 00:02:20.46
look.

50
00:02:20.46 --> 00:02:23.02
They're going to name drop even though they know it looks bad.

51
00:02:23.02 --> 00:02:26.62
Even though they'll point at someone else and say, oh, listen to Carrie name drop.

52
00:02:26.62 --> 00:02:29.66
They'll do that and then they'll name drop.

53
00:02:29.66 --> 00:02:31.06
They'll go, hey, see you.

54
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:32.06
Carrie was name drop and over.

55
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:33.06
You see him name dropping me.

56
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:35.46
I was talking to Joe Rogan yesterday.

57
00:02:35.46 --> 00:02:38.06
You're not on saying it?

58
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:40.06
That's how whack people are.

59
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:44.02
That's how we get stuck in lame situations.

60
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:49.94
So the crux of this book is actually the chapter we're going to start with right now.

61
00:02:49.94 --> 00:02:51.34
Dave Burke could make it by the way.

62
00:02:51.34 --> 00:02:54.34
It's good to work in busy.

63
00:02:54.34 --> 00:03:02.46
The chapter here is called authoritarianism and this is kind of the crux and this is

64
00:03:02.46 --> 00:03:06.34
this is what we need to watch out for.

65
00:03:06.34 --> 00:03:08.46
This is what we need to watch out for.

66
00:03:08.46 --> 00:03:10.38
This authoritarian mindset.

67
00:03:10.38 --> 00:03:13.06
Look, do you need to watch out for it as a nation?

68
00:03:13.06 --> 00:03:19.62
Yes, you better, especially as things start getting imposed on your life because that slides

69
00:03:19.62 --> 00:03:21.62
into authoritarianism.

70
00:03:21.62 --> 00:03:23.34
And that's a slippery slope.

71
00:03:23.34 --> 00:03:25.14
And I know you're going to bring up the slippery slope.

72
00:03:25.14 --> 00:03:26.14
Valicy.

73
00:03:26.14 --> 00:03:28.14
Well, I see you didn't your eyes.

74
00:03:28.14 --> 00:03:32.82
No, well, again, and I'll see that I said it before where there is such things as slippery

75
00:03:32.82 --> 00:03:33.82
slope.

76
00:03:33.82 --> 00:03:35.38
And there is such things as slippery slope.

77
00:03:35.38 --> 00:03:36.38
Valicy.

78
00:03:36.38 --> 00:03:38.58
They're not like one doesn't, you know.

79
00:03:38.58 --> 00:03:39.58
They both exist.

80
00:03:39.58 --> 00:03:42.02
They both exist exactly right.

81
00:03:42.02 --> 00:03:48.62
So authoritarianism in our minds, we have to watch out for it in our teams.

82
00:03:48.62 --> 00:03:49.94
As leaders, we have to watch out for it.

83
00:03:49.94 --> 00:03:55.06
And yes, as human beings living in a whatever country you live in, you need to watch out

84
00:03:55.06 --> 00:03:56.98
for that authoritarianism.

85
00:03:56.98 --> 00:04:03.82
Because it's a thing that once it starts to take hold, the authoritarian, it's no boss.

86
00:04:03.82 --> 00:04:05.26
Like, I get a little bit of control.

87
00:04:05.26 --> 00:04:08.26
A authoritarian people when they get a little bit of control, they want more control.

88
00:04:08.26 --> 00:04:09.90
And then they get a little bit more, they want even more.

89
00:04:09.90 --> 00:04:11.26
And they don't stop.

90
00:04:11.26 --> 00:04:20.74
It's a, it's a, it's a psychopathology that they have, that they can't contain it.

91
00:04:20.74 --> 00:04:21.74
So here we go.

92
00:04:21.74 --> 00:04:22.74
authoritarianism.

93
00:04:22.74 --> 00:04:26.86
In discussing military organizations, it was suggested that a symbiotic relationship

94
00:04:26.86 --> 00:04:31.86
exists between certain characteristics of armed services and the private needs of the individual

95
00:04:31.86 --> 00:04:32.86
members.

96
00:04:32.86 --> 00:04:36.54
So what that's saying is, when you go on the military, there's certain needs that certain

97
00:04:36.54 --> 00:04:40.38
people have, certain psychological needs that people have.

98
00:04:40.38 --> 00:04:43.22
But going in the military satisfies those needs.

99
00:04:43.22 --> 00:04:46.62
For instance, here's an example of where this is a bad thing.

100
00:04:46.62 --> 00:04:49.26
I like to rule over people.

101
00:04:49.26 --> 00:04:55.50
I know if I be coming off during the military, I'll be able to rule over those privates.

102
00:04:55.50 --> 00:05:01.14
So it sort of satisfies that to me.

103
00:05:01.14 --> 00:05:02.70
So there's a nice relationship I have.

104
00:05:02.70 --> 00:05:04.46
I want to be an authoritarian.

105
00:05:04.46 --> 00:05:06.14
This puts me into an authoritarian position.

106
00:05:06.14 --> 00:05:07.94
I love it.

107
00:05:07.94 --> 00:05:09.94
Is this true of all military people?

108
00:05:09.94 --> 00:05:10.94
No, it's not.

109
00:05:10.94 --> 00:05:15.22
Continue on emphasis was laid upon the central role in this relationship of anxiety that

110
00:05:15.22 --> 00:05:18.90
incidious motivator of such, of much human behavior.

111
00:05:18.90 --> 00:05:23.18
In the military mind, it was pointed out anxiety has many sources.

112
00:05:23.18 --> 00:05:29.94
Fear of death and mutilation, fear of suppression, fear of failure and social disapproval,

113
00:05:29.94 --> 00:05:36.94
fear of public disgrace and underlying all that fear of total disorder, which is in separable

114
00:05:36.94 --> 00:05:41.26
product of unleashing normally tabooed instinctual forces.

115
00:05:41.26 --> 00:05:46.14
So if you're a person that doesn't like disorder, you look at the military and go,

116
00:05:46.14 --> 00:05:47.14
huh?

117
00:05:47.14 --> 00:05:48.14
That looks pretty good.

118
00:05:48.14 --> 00:05:49.54
You gotta go to bed at a certain time.

119
00:05:49.54 --> 00:05:50.54
All these people will listen to me.

120
00:05:50.54 --> 00:05:51.54
We get to follow orders.

121
00:05:51.54 --> 00:05:52.54
They're going to tell me what to do.

122
00:05:52.54 --> 00:05:55.14
Everyone's going to listen to when I tell them what to do.

123
00:05:55.14 --> 00:05:59.70
That's you, you're a, if you don't like disorder, that's a great place to be.

124
00:05:59.70 --> 00:06:08.66
Until what happens, the layer of total disorder on planet earth opens its jaws and that

125
00:06:08.66 --> 00:06:10.02
is combat.

126
00:06:10.02 --> 00:06:15.54
So now you're a person that doesn't like disorder and for your job at the moment of truth,

127
00:06:15.54 --> 00:06:20.78
you are thrust into the jaws of the highest level of disorder in the world.

128
00:06:20.78 --> 00:06:22.42
That is combat.

129
00:06:22.42 --> 00:06:25.14
And that's why this is, that's what this book is about.

130
00:06:25.14 --> 00:06:29.66
This psychology of military incompetence is because people that like order.

131
00:06:29.66 --> 00:06:31.70
They join the military because they like order.

132
00:06:31.70 --> 00:06:33.10
And then they're actual job.

133
00:06:33.10 --> 00:06:37.10
Look, part of their job is marching around a parade field and inspecting uniforms and keeping

134
00:06:37.10 --> 00:06:38.10
everything square away.

135
00:06:38.10 --> 00:06:39.10
That's great.

136
00:06:39.10 --> 00:06:46.70
But when that, when that homey shows up and shit's getting crazy, they lose their minds.

137
00:06:46.70 --> 00:06:50.34
So when you're looking, when you're judging and you're thinking, I want to find that

138
00:06:50.34 --> 00:06:51.58
bad guy be a good military officer.

139
00:06:51.58 --> 00:06:54.10
They're highly disciplined.

140
00:06:54.10 --> 00:06:55.10
They're highly disciplined.

141
00:06:55.10 --> 00:06:57.30
They, they, they, they follow orders.

142
00:06:57.30 --> 00:06:59.62
They're a foritary and they seem like they be great.

143
00:06:59.62 --> 00:07:04.10
You need to remember what's that person going to do when things get wild and they're

144
00:07:04.10 --> 00:07:07.18
going to get wild.

145
00:07:07.18 --> 00:07:09.30
Continuing on, finally it was suggested.

146
00:07:09.30 --> 00:07:14.26
And you can see where this whole book, that little, that, that crocks.

147
00:07:14.26 --> 00:07:15.98
That's why I said this is the crux of the book.

148
00:07:15.98 --> 00:07:20.22
That crux right there is why this is so fascinating to me because I've seen this throughout

149
00:07:20.22 --> 00:07:21.62
my career.

150
00:07:21.62 --> 00:07:26.02
People that were square away, people that were highly disciplined, people that were

151
00:07:26.02 --> 00:07:30.82
loved for things to be in order and when things weren't going right or things were getting

152
00:07:30.82 --> 00:07:33.34
wild, they'd lose their minds.

153
00:07:33.34 --> 00:07:37.62
And by the way, if they never got put into a situation where things got wild, they get

154
00:07:37.62 --> 00:07:39.26
promoted by the way.

155
00:07:39.26 --> 00:07:42.34
They're getting promoted because they're the most ordered.

156
00:07:42.34 --> 00:07:47.62
They kept the tightest reins on their troops.

157
00:07:47.62 --> 00:07:51.42
Back to the book, finally it was suggested that a special predisposition toward these several

158
00:07:51.42 --> 00:07:55.70
sorts of anxiety may be present some people as a result of their early childhood.

159
00:07:55.70 --> 00:07:59.82
Again, this is where, and somebody pointed this out to me on one of the YouTube comments,

160
00:07:59.82 --> 00:08:03.30
the word I was looking for was psychobabble.

161
00:08:03.30 --> 00:08:04.30
Psychobabble.

162
00:08:04.30 --> 00:08:08.70
Because again, this guy was a psychologist, so he ties all the stuff into weird Freudian

163
00:08:08.70 --> 00:08:10.30
freaking childhood experiences.

164
00:08:10.30 --> 00:08:12.02
And I can't back any that up.

165
00:08:12.02 --> 00:08:14.02
I don't know about any of that.

166
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:17.38
What I do know is this, people have different personalities.

167
00:08:17.38 --> 00:08:20.34
Where those personalities came from, I don't really know, and I actually don't care.

168
00:08:20.34 --> 00:08:22.02
You show up to a seal team.

169
00:08:22.02 --> 00:08:27.66
Your personality is that whatever your personality is, and that's great.

170
00:08:27.66 --> 00:08:29.46
That's fine.

171
00:08:29.46 --> 00:08:30.78
I don't care where it came from.

172
00:08:30.78 --> 00:08:34.62
If you're hyper-ordered and you can't stand it when things get wild, you're not going

173
00:08:34.62 --> 00:08:38.54
to be a good seal officer or a good seal leader.

174
00:08:38.54 --> 00:08:44.70
If you're totally rebellious and you can't fall in the line ever, well that's too far

175
00:08:44.70 --> 00:08:48.82
in the other direction, and now you can't control anything, you can't control yourself.

176
00:08:48.82 --> 00:08:54.42
So we want to find some of that balances that dichotomy, but whether it comes from early childhood

177
00:08:54.42 --> 00:08:58.66
in the way you were potty trained in all these kinds of psychobabble, I don't know.

178
00:08:58.66 --> 00:08:59.66
I don't know.

179
00:08:59.66 --> 00:09:04.94
We'll have to ask Jordan B. Peter's a name drop about that one.

180
00:09:04.94 --> 00:09:08.38
Such people may well be drawn towards military organizations because the latter have

181
00:09:08.38 --> 00:09:14.86
of necessity, perfected devices like bullshit, discipline, and hierarchical command structures

182
00:09:14.86 --> 00:09:20.34
and rigid conventions, which not only allow aggression without anxiety, but also reduce

183
00:09:20.34 --> 00:09:23.98
anxiety that may have originated much earlier period of life.

184
00:09:23.98 --> 00:09:28.58
Again, a little bit, a little bit psychoanalysis too much for me.

185
00:09:28.58 --> 00:09:32.78
It's sort of, it's a bummer because as I've said many times, Jordan Peterson may be

186
00:09:32.78 --> 00:09:36.46
starting to like think maybe psychology was sort of a real thing.

187
00:09:36.46 --> 00:09:38.46
This is kind of dropping back in the back.

188
00:09:38.46 --> 00:09:41.30
Sorry, psychology.

189
00:09:41.30 --> 00:09:47.22
Somebody who put somebody who went, I was reading YouTube notes, no comments.

190
00:09:47.22 --> 00:09:51.62
And somebody was telling me that, you know, what much of what Freud said was actually right,

191
00:09:51.62 --> 00:10:00.42
but he's just been so like hammered by his reputation because he was a cocaine fiend.

192
00:10:00.42 --> 00:10:04.82
And now we kind of dis dis dis disperse or dispatch everything that he said.

193
00:10:04.82 --> 00:10:06.18
So maybe I was a little hard on him.

194
00:10:06.18 --> 00:10:07.18
I don't know.

195
00:10:07.18 --> 00:10:10.70
As far as I'm concerned, if you're doing a lot of cocaine like that and you're prescribing

196
00:10:10.70 --> 00:10:15.46
it to a bunch of people and you're lying about who's getting cured, I kind of take a lot of

197
00:10:15.46 --> 00:10:17.46
what you said and thrown out the window.

198
00:10:17.46 --> 00:10:19.62
Yeah, well, what's that?

199
00:10:19.62 --> 00:10:21.74
There's a bias too, right?

200
00:10:21.74 --> 00:10:23.46
The cocaine addiction.

201
00:10:23.46 --> 00:10:24.46
I don't know.

202
00:10:24.46 --> 00:10:25.46
Yes, that's my bias.

203
00:10:25.46 --> 00:10:27.46
I'm biased against people that are addicted to cocaine.

204
00:10:27.46 --> 00:10:28.46
No, it's not a bias.

205
00:10:28.46 --> 00:10:29.46
It's a logical fallacy.

206
00:10:29.46 --> 00:10:36.34
I don't know if you're you're committing this logical fallacy, but it's the, I forget

207
00:10:36.34 --> 00:10:37.34
what it is.

208
00:10:37.34 --> 00:10:41.06
The example is like, oh, why would you listen to Fred?

209
00:10:41.06 --> 00:10:43.42
Fred doesn't even have a job.

210
00:10:43.42 --> 00:10:46.58
So it's kind of like, okay, it's like, I think I am committing this.

211
00:10:46.58 --> 00:10:48.62
It's like, you kind of like, why would you listen to Freud?

212
00:10:48.62 --> 00:10:50.62
I know Freud's addicted to cocaine.

213
00:10:50.62 --> 00:10:51.62
Yeah, I'm lying to people.

214
00:10:51.62 --> 00:10:55.02
I'm not saying you're making the bad decision and I'm like that.

215
00:10:55.02 --> 00:10:59.18
I'm saying from a logical standpoint, it's technically a fallacy.

216
00:10:59.18 --> 00:11:02.82
It's like, okay, that means if you do cocaine, everything else you say is incorrect.

217
00:11:02.82 --> 00:11:03.82
Is that what that means?

218
00:11:03.82 --> 00:11:04.82
Yeah.

219
00:11:04.82 --> 00:11:05.82
For a logical standpoint.

220
00:11:05.82 --> 00:11:06.82
You're right.

221
00:11:06.82 --> 00:11:11.26
Well, I'll concede that per, well, that's what I am continuing.

222
00:11:11.26 --> 00:11:12.26
Okay.

223
00:11:12.26 --> 00:11:13.26
Freud was right part of the time.

224
00:11:13.26 --> 00:11:16.34
Give Freud his part on some of the stuff.

225
00:11:16.34 --> 00:11:22.54
As you was, you know, just not a, in light of all this, it is encouraging to encounter

226
00:11:22.54 --> 00:11:26.18
a substantial body of research, which not only provides support for the thesis, but also

227
00:11:26.18 --> 00:11:29.70
fills in many of the gaps.

228
00:11:29.70 --> 00:11:34.42
It is that on the authoritarian personality and then they get into this massive section

229
00:11:34.42 --> 00:11:37.54
about the authoritarian personality, which I'm not comfortable with because I've already spent

230
00:11:37.54 --> 00:11:40.54
six freaking podcasts on this book, which is all good.

231
00:11:40.54 --> 00:11:44.98
But I'm going to do a little bit of it for the impetus behind the study of authoritarianism.

232
00:11:44.98 --> 00:11:53.98
We have to think the founders and proponents of the third Reich, they, it who was presented

233
00:11:53.98 --> 00:11:58.50
to the world, a phenomenon, the like of which has never been seen before, since the

234
00:11:58.50 --> 00:12:05.18
systematic bureaucratized murder of six million Jews to the inquiring mind anti-Semitism

235
00:12:05.18 --> 00:12:09.78
on the scale would seem to demand at the very least some explanation for group of researchers

236
00:12:09.78 --> 00:12:15.78
at Frankfurt and later at Berkeley, California, the fact that human prejudice could assume

237
00:12:15.78 --> 00:12:21.06
such monstrous proportion suggested the possibility of a particular personality type being

238
00:12:21.06 --> 00:12:23.86
implicated in the perpetration of these dark events.

239
00:12:23.86 --> 00:12:33.30
So basically he's saying, look, the Nazis were psycho, where did their personality come from,

240
00:12:33.30 --> 00:12:35.34
what type of people had that personality?

241
00:12:35.34 --> 00:12:42.26
And then he goes into a Nazi psychologist whose name was Jinch, something like that,

242
00:12:42.26 --> 00:12:48.34
Jinch, I don't know, sorry, they're Nazi bastards from mispronouncing your name.

243
00:12:48.34 --> 00:12:58.50
So he broke it down and there was S types at the high end could have something called

244
00:12:58.50 --> 00:13:01.50
Syncysia, have you ever heard of Syncysia before?

245
00:13:01.50 --> 00:13:04.02
Syncysia, this is a very interesting story.

246
00:13:04.02 --> 00:13:11.54
So Syncysia, Seston, he was could memorize any number immediately.

247
00:13:11.54 --> 00:13:16.58
So if he met like a female in a bar, he would say what's your number and they would

248
00:13:16.58 --> 00:13:20.26
say it and he would immediately know it.

249
00:13:20.26 --> 00:13:26.74
And then he was really good at weird math problems and he could memorize dates.

250
00:13:26.74 --> 00:13:35.06
And one day we were talking because it was notistable enough, how good he was at it,

251
00:13:35.06 --> 00:13:38.90
that you think to yourself, there's something a little different, that's really weird how

252
00:13:38.90 --> 00:13:40.90
he could memorize this stuff.

253
00:13:40.90 --> 00:13:47.90
So he said to me one day he goes, you know, this is kind of weird, but when I see numbers,

254
00:13:47.90 --> 00:13:53.66
I don't see a number, I see a color and it has like a texture to it.

255
00:13:53.66 --> 00:13:59.46
And I was like, okay, bro, if we were to the military, I'd think you were maybe on

256
00:13:59.46 --> 00:14:00.46
something.

257
00:14:00.46 --> 00:14:03.06
So LSD or whatever.

258
00:14:03.06 --> 00:14:04.34
So he, I said, what do you mean?

259
00:14:04.34 --> 00:14:10.86
He says, well, for me, and then he described the colors of each, the colors and textures

260
00:14:10.86 --> 00:14:13.70
of each number.

261
00:14:13.70 --> 00:14:18.34
So the only one I remember was that zero was like hollow.

262
00:14:18.34 --> 00:14:20.54
He said he said zero was hollow.

263
00:14:20.54 --> 00:14:24.34
It's not, it's like it's not there.

264
00:14:24.34 --> 00:14:27.70
One was white.

265
00:14:27.70 --> 00:14:31.74
And the other one I remember is seven was yellow.

266
00:14:31.74 --> 00:14:34.18
And the reason I remembered that one was because I have two sevens in my phone number and

267
00:14:34.18 --> 00:14:37.54
when the first time I asked him what I said, say my phone number in colors and he was

268
00:14:37.54 --> 00:14:39.62
like, you know, yellow, yellow, but a blue.

269
00:14:39.62 --> 00:14:41.86
And yellow, yellow and I have two sevens.

270
00:14:41.86 --> 00:14:45.22
And I said, what's, I go seven, yellow because yeah.

271
00:14:45.22 --> 00:14:46.10
So it was just weird.

272
00:14:46.10 --> 00:14:49.50
He had no idea why this was the situation.

273
00:14:49.50 --> 00:14:56.54
So one day I'm in a bookstore and this is kind of early in the day when you would

274
00:14:56.54 --> 00:14:59.26
just go on a website to buy your books.

275
00:14:59.26 --> 00:15:07.54
I'm in a bookstore and I see numbers on a cover of a book and they're all colored and

276
00:15:07.54 --> 00:15:10.50
textured and I was, I was, that's weird.

277
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:14.54
And I walk over and I pick it up and I start looking through it and it says, oh, this book is

278
00:15:14.54 --> 00:15:18.82
about a person that had Sanisticia.

279
00:15:18.82 --> 00:15:20.86
And so it, so I look it up.

280
00:15:20.86 --> 00:15:34.46
Sanisticia is a thing where you have multiple, multiple modes of interpreting information.

281
00:15:34.46 --> 00:15:37.66
So for instance, numbers have colors.

282
00:15:37.66 --> 00:15:40.66
They can have letters, can have colors.

283
00:15:40.66 --> 00:15:45.58
But that's the way, that's the way Seth fought.

284
00:15:45.58 --> 00:15:53.86
And so for this Nazi, the change, that was kind of the far end of this kind of wild, creative

285
00:15:53.86 --> 00:15:54.86
thing.

286
00:15:54.86 --> 00:16:00.30
This kind of wild, creative person here, it says, to have subjective experiences in one

287
00:16:00.30 --> 00:16:02.46
modality when receiving stimulation in another.

288
00:16:02.46 --> 00:16:05.50
This is the kind of wildest brain that you can get.

289
00:16:05.50 --> 00:16:08.94
And so this Nazi guy, this is the S type.

290
00:16:08.94 --> 00:16:10.74
These are people that are S types.

291
00:16:10.74 --> 00:16:14.86
It doesn't mean they necessarily have Sanisticia, but they're leaning in that direction.

292
00:16:14.86 --> 00:16:20.90
And this quote has the liberal in his views, eccentric behavior, also weak, a feminine

293
00:16:20.90 --> 00:16:25.90
and prone to a radical belief that people are largely shaped by their environment and education.

294
00:16:25.90 --> 00:16:31.86
Again, this is from an Nazi psychologist, which, if we're not listening to Freud, we're

295
00:16:31.86 --> 00:16:33.90
not listening to this Nazi dude.

296
00:16:33.90 --> 00:16:36.62
So but he's breaking it down in two types, the S type.

297
00:16:36.62 --> 00:16:39.46
And then the other type is the J type.

298
00:16:39.46 --> 00:16:49.26
And according to this guy, the J type were quote, good types that would make good Nazis

299
00:16:49.26 --> 00:16:55.22
amongst their sterling qualities, where purity and perception and the sure knowledge that

300
00:16:55.22 --> 00:16:59.62
human behavior is determined by blood, soil, and national tradition.

301
00:16:59.62 --> 00:17:07.90
The hence freaking Nazis, the J type, so the Nazi type would be a he-man hard and tough

302
00:17:07.90 --> 00:17:10.18
a man you could rely on.

303
00:17:10.18 --> 00:17:17.98
These qualities would he said have been handed down by a long line of North German ancestors.

304
00:17:17.98 --> 00:17:20.22
So this is what the Nazi says.

305
00:17:20.22 --> 00:17:26.14
And it's just, it's kind of funny because, well, Sstone was about as hard of a bastard

306
00:17:26.14 --> 00:17:27.86
as you could ever know.

307
00:17:27.86 --> 00:17:30.90
And a certain be a he-man, a divisible as well.

308
00:17:30.90 --> 00:17:35.54
And a warrior, a big freaking Viking warrior, a Texas mom, the other day, I was like, yeah,

309
00:17:35.54 --> 00:17:42.54
thanks for letting me hang out with that freaking savage, Viking kid of yours.

310
00:17:42.54 --> 00:17:45.86
So now we go to the Berkeley study.

311
00:17:45.86 --> 00:17:49.78
So we just did the Nazi study who got these two different types, the S type, which is sort

312
00:17:49.78 --> 00:17:55.14
of a liberal sort of a feminine type, and then the J type, which is more of the conservative

313
00:17:55.14 --> 00:17:57.14
hardcore type.

314
00:17:57.14 --> 00:18:03.34
And the American researchers later, going back to the book, also found two contrasting

315
00:18:03.34 --> 00:18:08.26
personality types, and these were very like those described by change.

316
00:18:08.26 --> 00:18:12.02
Needless to say, they evaluated them rather differently, the one that corresponded to the

317
00:18:12.02 --> 00:18:16.26
J type, they called the authoritarian personality.

318
00:18:16.26 --> 00:18:20.58
Such a person was anti-Semitic, rigid, intolerant of ambiguity.

319
00:18:20.58 --> 00:18:22.02
I can't think about this.

320
00:18:22.02 --> 00:18:25.90
If you're intolerant of ambiguity, think of how you're in a performing combat.

321
00:18:25.90 --> 00:18:31.46
You're going to be great in the military, in the in the in the in the rear of the military,

322
00:18:31.46 --> 00:18:34.54
because you're you don't like ambiguity, as soon as you're in combat, you don't know exactly

323
00:18:34.54 --> 00:18:35.54
know what's happening.

324
00:18:35.54 --> 00:18:39.34
You got to make it as soon as you're going to hate it.

325
00:18:39.34 --> 00:18:48.22
So intolerant of ambiguity and hostile to people or groups racially different from himself

326
00:18:48.22 --> 00:18:54.06
by the same token of the polar opposite to this type, change, contemptible, anti-type was

327
00:18:54.06 --> 00:19:02.30
individualistic, tolerant, democratic, unpredgidists, and egalitarian.

328
00:19:02.30 --> 00:19:06.14
So you've got these two different personalities.

329
00:19:06.14 --> 00:19:08.50
The Nazis called the bad one good.

330
00:19:08.50 --> 00:19:11.62
And the Berkeley people called the good one bad.

331
00:19:11.62 --> 00:19:15.82
So you get, however you want to break that down.

332
00:19:15.82 --> 00:19:20.82
Their test provided measures of anti-Semitism, ethnocentrism, political and economic

333
00:19:20.82 --> 00:19:28.22
conservatism, and implicit anti-democratic trends or potentiality for fascism, which

334
00:19:28.22 --> 00:19:30.06
they called the F scale.

335
00:19:30.06 --> 00:19:34.18
Like what is your potential of becoming a fascist?

336
00:19:34.18 --> 00:19:38.46
This much of which is based on by actual utterances by the Nazis measured in individuals

337
00:19:38.46 --> 00:19:40.22
predisposition towards.

338
00:19:40.22 --> 00:19:41.98
So this is what the F type.

339
00:19:41.98 --> 00:19:47.06
If you have a tendency where you can become a fascist, conventionalism, ie rigid adherence

340
00:19:47.06 --> 00:19:50.10
to conventional middle-class values.

341
00:19:50.10 --> 00:19:53.78
A foritarian submission.

342
00:19:53.78 --> 00:20:00.10
A submissive uncritical attitude toward the idealized moral authorities of the group,

343
00:20:00.10 --> 00:20:01.86
which he identifies himself.

344
00:20:01.86 --> 00:20:04.42
And that's what's kind of crazy, right?

345
00:20:04.42 --> 00:20:08.10
You would think that a foritarians would be hard to control.

346
00:20:08.10 --> 00:20:12.66
But if you're part of that group, they're in the game.

347
00:20:12.66 --> 00:20:17.86
So that's why I like the young officer in the military that he's totally down.

348
00:20:17.86 --> 00:20:22.10
He's saluting without most vigor because he's part of that system.

349
00:20:22.10 --> 00:20:23.66
And he's on board.

350
00:20:23.66 --> 00:20:27.94
He's submissive to the system.

351
00:20:27.94 --> 00:20:33.50
A foritarian aggression, ie, a tendency to be on the lookout for and to condemn reject

352
00:20:33.50 --> 00:20:37.38
and punish people who violate conventional values.

353
00:20:37.38 --> 00:20:40.62
It's kind of weird how there's like right now.

354
00:20:40.62 --> 00:20:46.78
You've got antifa who's supposed to be sort of like the wild antifascist who's actually

355
00:20:46.78 --> 00:20:51.34
totally on board with what I'm saying right now as they're off the charts on the F scale.

356
00:20:51.34 --> 00:20:57.98
Yeah, so like this, I don't know if this S F scale would reflect this specifically or accurately.

357
00:20:57.98 --> 00:21:01.22
But essentially, like two sides, right?

358
00:21:01.22 --> 00:21:03.18
One is real conventional, right?

359
00:21:03.18 --> 00:21:07.14
They're probably probably, I don't know, but they're probably going to ignore exceptions.

360
00:21:07.14 --> 00:21:10.26
You know, the value of exceptions and the nuance and all this stuff, right?

361
00:21:10.26 --> 00:21:12.10
They're going to tend to ignore it, right?

362
00:21:12.10 --> 00:21:17.98
Then you have the other side who probably overvalue nuance and exceptions.

363
00:21:17.98 --> 00:21:23.22
Kind of like, hey, if there's these exceptions, that must be just as equal as the rule.

364
00:21:23.22 --> 00:21:25.98
Because you know, you kind of look at the individual, you know?

365
00:21:25.98 --> 00:21:29.98
So that antifa analogy is absolutely correct.

366
00:21:29.98 --> 00:21:31.14
They're doing an exact same thing.

367
00:21:31.14 --> 00:21:32.14
They're just reversed.

368
00:21:32.14 --> 00:21:37.22
Yeah, you got to kind of, I don't know, back in the day, it seems like everyone was way

369
00:21:37.22 --> 00:21:38.22
more just in the middle.

370
00:21:38.22 --> 00:21:41.38
Well, balance is what we lose.

371
00:21:41.38 --> 00:21:44.82
What you want, even on these two things, do you want to be a fascist?

372
00:21:44.82 --> 00:21:48.10
No, but do you want to be crazy uncontrollable?

373
00:21:48.10 --> 00:21:49.82
No, you want to be balanced.

374
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:50.82
Yeah.

375
00:21:50.82 --> 00:21:51.82
Yeah.

376
00:21:51.82 --> 00:21:57.70
And even just valuing like the group and then on the other hand, valuing the individual,

377
00:21:57.70 --> 00:21:59.26
it's like you got to value both of those things.

378
00:21:59.26 --> 00:22:00.26
I think about those things.

379
00:22:00.26 --> 00:22:01.26
100%.

380
00:22:01.26 --> 00:22:02.26
Yeah.

381
00:22:02.26 --> 00:22:03.26
100%.

382
00:22:03.26 --> 00:22:07.26
Next one, anti-interception.

383
00:22:07.26 --> 00:22:16.06
IE opposition to the subjective, the imaginative, and the tender-minded superstition and

384
00:22:16.06 --> 00:22:23.18
stereotype power and toughness preoccupation with the dominant submission, strong, weak,

385
00:22:23.18 --> 00:22:28.10
leader, follower, dimension, identification with power figures, overemphasis on conventional

386
00:22:28.10 --> 00:22:35.42
attributes of the ego, exaggeration, exaggerated, exaggerated assertion of strength and toughness.

387
00:22:35.42 --> 00:22:37.22
So how much of that is important?

388
00:22:37.22 --> 00:22:39.78
You know, that's putting you out there on that F scale a little bit.

389
00:22:39.78 --> 00:22:41.26
I'm starting to drift, man.

390
00:22:41.26 --> 00:22:43.54
Start to drift.

391
00:22:43.54 --> 00:22:46.10
Destructiveness and cynicism.

392
00:22:46.10 --> 00:22:49.38
Generalized hostility, vilification of the human.

393
00:22:49.38 --> 00:22:55.66
So obviously, a lot of this was focused around, hey, the Nazis and where the Nazis came from,

394
00:22:55.66 --> 00:23:01.26
part of that F thing is they can look at humans and be like whatever they don't matter.

395
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:06.34
Projectivity, the belief that wild and dangerous things go on in the world, the projection

396
00:23:06.34 --> 00:23:14.68
outwards of unconscious emotional impulses, pure, atanical and exaggerated concern with

397
00:23:14.68 --> 00:23:20.74
sexual goings on.

398
00:23:20.74 --> 00:23:25.46
So you got these two personality types.

399
00:23:25.46 --> 00:23:30.34
Another little note here, these torturous machinations of the authority of the authoritarian

400
00:23:30.34 --> 00:23:32.70
mind, ramify yet further.

401
00:23:32.70 --> 00:23:37.50
As he has to deny his own shortcomings, he dare not look inward.

402
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:42.70
He is fearful of insight and strenuously avoids questioning his own motives.

403
00:23:42.70 --> 00:23:48.78
Again, this is when people are, they're not real confident with themselves, so they project

404
00:23:48.78 --> 00:23:51.54
and look at everyone else.

405
00:23:51.54 --> 00:23:56.22
Similarly, the authoritarian personality is intolerant of ambivalence and ambiguity.

406
00:23:56.22 --> 00:23:57.22
We already hit that.

407
00:23:57.22 --> 00:24:03.06
Not as he cannot harbor negative and positive feelings for the same person, but must dichotomize

408
00:24:03.06 --> 00:24:09.18
reality into loved people versus hated people.

409
00:24:09.18 --> 00:24:16.98
So that's a very, that's restating what you said, because someone, what should you be able

410
00:24:16.98 --> 00:24:17.98
to do?

411
00:24:17.98 --> 00:24:21.58
You should be able to look at echo and be like, you know what, I like that echo, he's

412
00:24:21.58 --> 00:24:27.18
pretty nice, but also he can get a little bit lazy sometimes, but overall, you know,

413
00:24:27.18 --> 00:24:28.18
we're good.

414
00:24:28.18 --> 00:24:32.18
Cryptic messages, whatever.

415
00:24:32.18 --> 00:24:37.78
Right, but if I say echo is nice, but freaking easily easy, I can't stand him, right?

416
00:24:37.78 --> 00:24:41.46
And then you can start looking from one individual to look to a whole group of people,

417
00:24:41.46 --> 00:24:45.74
as you said, and start looking at a group of people and just saying, well, that group

418
00:24:45.74 --> 00:24:46.74
of people is bad.

419
00:24:46.74 --> 00:24:49.34
Did I just do that with Antifa?

420
00:24:49.34 --> 00:24:51.06
I just kind of, sorry, you implied it.

421
00:24:51.06 --> 00:24:52.06
I'm sorry, Antifa.

422
00:24:52.06 --> 00:24:57.14
I need a little bit more over-minded to your individuals.

423
00:24:57.14 --> 00:25:02.34
Yeah, they're one of those groups that they're, they're, they're current public facing

424
00:25:02.34 --> 00:25:08.42
persona, not that hard.

425
00:25:08.42 --> 00:25:14.58
There's another nine-year research that took place published a decade after the Berkeley

426
00:25:14.58 --> 00:25:22.34
Research, and this is something that I've been focused on a lot, and it's the open and

427
00:25:22.34 --> 00:25:29.58
closed mind centered on the problem of an individual's capacity to absorb fresh information,

428
00:25:29.58 --> 00:25:33.22
humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.

429
00:25:33.22 --> 00:25:35.62
And God, that is true.

430
00:25:35.62 --> 00:25:40.46
So this guy, his name is Rokech, Rockych, something like this, and he did this study,

431
00:25:40.46 --> 00:25:42.66
started breaking down, they're open in the close mind.

432
00:25:42.66 --> 00:25:44.66
Some people have open minds, some people have closed minds.

433
00:25:44.66 --> 00:25:50.46
And I actually think that this is even, kind of, trumps the F, what was it?

434
00:25:50.46 --> 00:25:51.46
The F scale.

435
00:25:51.46 --> 00:25:53.10
I think this trumps the F scale.

436
00:25:53.10 --> 00:25:57.38
How much can someone's mind open, how much can it close?

437
00:25:57.38 --> 00:26:04.02
And I've been talking a lot about this from a leadership perspective, because it is,

438
00:26:04.02 --> 00:26:07.54
to me, what we have to fight all the time.

439
00:26:07.54 --> 00:26:11.22
Our minds are constantly trying to close and be defensive and take care of themselves

440
00:26:11.22 --> 00:26:15.46
and not allow any other ideas in and what we have to do as people and as leaders is constantly

441
00:26:15.46 --> 00:26:18.62
pull your mind open, constantly except other people's ideas.

442
00:26:18.62 --> 00:26:21.94
It doesn't mean you have to think that the right, but you have to listen to them and assess

443
00:26:21.94 --> 00:26:23.38
them in an honest way.

444
00:26:23.38 --> 00:26:28.18
And what we have been doing a lot of, as a society, is just closing our minds to everyone else's

445
00:26:28.18 --> 00:26:29.18
ideas.

446
00:26:29.18 --> 00:26:31.62
And we don't want to hear what their perspective is, because we think we're right.

447
00:26:31.62 --> 00:26:36.94
And if you do that as a leader, you come to me with a viewpoint on my plan.

448
00:26:36.94 --> 00:26:42.06
And I don't open my mind to your viewpoint, I'm wrong.

449
00:26:42.06 --> 00:26:43.06
Goes on here.

450
00:26:43.06 --> 00:26:44.82
Humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.

451
00:26:44.82 --> 00:26:48.86
At the one extreme, our open minds, ready and willing to entertain new facts even if they

452
00:26:48.86 --> 00:26:52.70
are incompatible with their previously held attitudes and beliefs.

453
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:53.70
That's what we want.

454
00:26:53.70 --> 00:26:55.30
You've got to open your mind and go, hey, you know what?

455
00:26:55.30 --> 00:26:59.82
I really expect to see those numbers or get that feedback, but there it is.

456
00:26:59.82 --> 00:27:03.98
And I need to put that in my calculus.

457
00:27:03.98 --> 00:27:09.34
The other, at the other end of the scale, are closed minds, which, as their name suggests,

458
00:27:09.34 --> 00:27:14.38
is a resultally resist taking in anything that conflicts with their preconceptions and treasured

459
00:27:14.38 --> 00:27:19.38
beliefs, not very surprisingly the possession of a closed mind turned out to be yet another

460
00:27:19.38 --> 00:27:26.22
aspect of the authoritarian personality.

461
00:27:26.22 --> 00:27:31.38
Is that, okay, so you can always make it like an analogy to wait lifting for some reason.

462
00:27:31.38 --> 00:27:32.38
No, you can.

463
00:27:32.38 --> 00:27:33.38
But I'm open to it.

464
00:27:33.38 --> 00:27:35.38
That's your way to go.

465
00:27:35.38 --> 00:27:40.66
Like I wonder if that's like a laser, you know, by nature, like the human body and brain

466
00:27:40.66 --> 00:27:42.86
is kind of late for lack of better term in slaves.

467
00:27:42.86 --> 00:27:45.30
It's conserving energy all the time, you know?

468
00:27:45.30 --> 00:27:50.54
So even like lifting weights, when you lift weights, your body's response to lifting weights

469
00:27:50.54 --> 00:27:52.54
is just a lazy, laziness mechanism.

470
00:27:52.54 --> 00:27:55.70
So the body is basically saying, oh, shoot, that was kind of hard.

471
00:27:55.70 --> 00:27:57.14
What do we got to do at home?

472
00:27:57.14 --> 00:27:59.62
Tell me in the body to make it a little bit easier next time.

473
00:27:59.62 --> 00:28:02.38
And then it adapts and gets bigger and stronger, whatever.

474
00:28:02.38 --> 00:28:07.14
So kind of like a weird, like I said, laziness, lack of better term mechanism.

475
00:28:07.14 --> 00:28:10.34
So like when you have a close mind, it's kind of like, hey, I already learned that.

476
00:28:10.34 --> 00:28:11.66
Like, give me some more stuff.

477
00:28:11.66 --> 00:28:12.66
I got to learn.

478
00:28:12.66 --> 00:28:13.66
You know, kind of thing.

479
00:28:13.66 --> 00:28:14.66
So then it's easier.

480
00:28:14.66 --> 00:28:15.94
Like because it's all mental, it's not physical.

481
00:28:15.94 --> 00:28:18.78
So you just kind of resist against it.

482
00:28:18.78 --> 00:28:24.02
And you can see where this ties into everything that I have talked about from a leadership

483
00:28:24.02 --> 00:28:29.14
perspective for my entire life, which is humility.

484
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:33.06
Because if your humble, your mind is open, if your arrogant, your mind is closed, you

485
00:28:33.06 --> 00:28:34.06
think you know everything.

486
00:28:34.06 --> 00:28:35.06
You don't need to hear anything else.

487
00:28:35.06 --> 00:28:36.06
You're not going to make any adaptations.

488
00:28:36.06 --> 00:28:39.06
Yeah, when you see that little system that kind of makes sense.

489
00:28:39.06 --> 00:28:40.06
It makes so much sense.

490
00:28:40.06 --> 00:28:42.18
Right, especially go back to the weightlifting.

491
00:28:42.18 --> 00:28:44.06
Like you give your body some definitely go back to the left.

492
00:28:44.06 --> 00:28:45.06
That's only a workout.

493
00:28:45.06 --> 00:28:47.50
Right, the next day, you get that domes.

494
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:49.06
Right, you don't like that stuff.

495
00:28:49.06 --> 00:28:52.10
Like I remember when I was little, I do some pushups, thinking I'm all cool, whatever,

496
00:28:52.10 --> 00:28:53.10
do some of the next day.

497
00:28:53.10 --> 00:28:55.78
I'm like, so I didn't know about domes that much.

498
00:28:55.78 --> 00:28:57.46
And bro, that's a terrible feeling.

499
00:28:57.46 --> 00:28:59.26
So super, I'm not doing that anymore.

500
00:28:59.26 --> 00:29:02.58
Or at the very least, the inside of my body, my body is like, okay, we got to do something

501
00:29:02.58 --> 00:29:06.54
easier or make it so it's easier next time that happens.

502
00:29:06.54 --> 00:29:09.78
So from a mental standpoint, it makes sense.

503
00:29:09.78 --> 00:29:11.18
Where Brad, what do you call it?

504
00:29:11.18 --> 00:29:13.70
The fucking you call, you talk to about it last.

505
00:29:13.70 --> 00:29:16.26
The cognitive dissidence or whatever.

506
00:29:16.26 --> 00:29:18.94
That is domes for your mind, essentially.

507
00:29:18.94 --> 00:29:22.10
Or maybe the precursor to the, I don't know, it's one of those things.

508
00:29:22.10 --> 00:29:23.54
I'm just saying it makes sense.

509
00:29:23.54 --> 00:29:24.54
Is that hurts?

510
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:26.22
You know, when you get that new stuff.

511
00:29:26.22 --> 00:29:27.78
I don't want that new stuff.

512
00:29:27.78 --> 00:29:28.98
I'm good with this old stuff.

513
00:29:28.98 --> 00:29:29.98
Close mind.

514
00:29:29.98 --> 00:29:31.18
Yeah.

515
00:29:31.18 --> 00:29:35.22
He says here, before leaving this section on a foritarianism, there are several other research

516
00:29:35.22 --> 00:29:37.98
findings which are pertinent to our present thesis.

517
00:29:37.98 --> 00:29:42.86
One of these shows the relationship between conformity, a foritarianism, and the tendency

518
00:29:42.86 --> 00:29:44.98
to yield to group pressures.

519
00:29:44.98 --> 00:29:50.86
An extreme example of this pattern is the phenomenon of the participation in a lynch mob,

520
00:29:50.86 --> 00:29:56.18
where the naturally conformist individual happily yields to group pressure for the

521
00:29:56.18 --> 00:30:02.30
perpetration of a criminally aggressive act, which the holy at variance with the ethos

522
00:30:02.30 --> 00:30:08.98
of the wider society accords with his own narrow self-interest.

523
00:30:08.98 --> 00:30:16.14
So again, it's a, it's a, it's counterintuitive to think that someone that's a foritarian

524
00:30:16.14 --> 00:30:21.18
is going to be more apt to go with the group.

525
00:30:21.18 --> 00:30:25.18
Another finding concerns the effect of authoritarianism upon problem solving in a group

526
00:30:25.18 --> 00:30:26.02
situation.

527
00:30:26.02 --> 00:30:30.90
Oh, I love this one because again, I'm thinking of it from a military perspective and

528
00:30:30.90 --> 00:30:36.18
you start thinking, now you got this authoritarian in command how are they at problem solving?

529
00:30:36.18 --> 00:30:40.34
Well, let's go to the book from their research.

530
00:30:40.34 --> 00:30:47.02
W. H. Thorn in his colleagues concluded this, that, Equalitarian subjects, I.e. those

531
00:30:47.02 --> 00:30:52.66
low on authoritarianism were apparently more effective in dealing with a task in problem

532
00:30:52.66 --> 00:30:55.26
than were authoritarian.

533
00:30:55.26 --> 00:30:57.62
So that open mind is way better for problem solving.

534
00:30:57.62 --> 00:31:03.34
Seems obvious, but this was reflected in higher ratings of effective intelligence, leadership

535
00:31:03.34 --> 00:31:08.46
and goal-striving on the sorts of leaders who emerged in the group situation.

536
00:31:08.46 --> 00:31:16.22
They had this to say, emergent leaders in the low F groups were more sensitive to others,

537
00:31:16.22 --> 00:31:21.62
more effective leaders, more prone to making suggestions for action subject to group

538
00:31:21.62 --> 00:31:26.66
sanction and less likely to give direct orders to others.

539
00:31:26.66 --> 00:31:32.58
This is insane how much this matches everything I've been talking about.

540
00:31:32.58 --> 00:31:38.02
A conclusion incidentally, which accords with the observation that authoritarianists are less

541
00:31:38.02 --> 00:31:43.38
able to appreciate the effect they have upon others and may well think themselves more

542
00:31:43.38 --> 00:31:47.58
like to popular than they really are.

543
00:31:47.58 --> 00:31:51.98
I'm chuckling as I think of my military career and people that thought that they were super

544
00:31:51.98 --> 00:31:54.74
popular and everyone who you do.

545
00:31:54.74 --> 00:32:00.82
Even people attracted to a career in an authoritarian organization.

546
00:32:00.82 --> 00:32:09.02
I.e. the military have been found to prefer leaders who score low on a, on a, on

547
00:32:09.02 --> 00:32:13.38
test of authoritarianism, presumably because of authoritarianists are less sensitive to

548
00:32:13.38 --> 00:32:14.38
the needs of other.

549
00:32:14.38 --> 00:32:18.30
Even when you're a, when you're kind of authoritarian yourself and you joined the

550
00:32:18.30 --> 00:32:22.78
military, when you get asked about what type of leader you like, guess what?

551
00:32:22.78 --> 00:32:27.26
You actually like less authoritarian leaders because they listen, they treat you with respect,

552
00:32:27.26 --> 00:32:29.62
their minds are open.

553
00:32:29.62 --> 00:32:32.46
So this is the best way to lead across the board.

554
00:32:32.46 --> 00:32:37.34
You know, skyscrapers here in San Diego, California, I'm sure it's like this ever.

555
00:32:37.34 --> 00:32:38.86
I'm not an engineer.

556
00:32:38.86 --> 00:32:41.34
You know that.

557
00:32:41.34 --> 00:32:45.78
From what I understand, okay, so think of a tall building, right?

558
00:32:45.78 --> 00:32:46.78
It's talk.

559
00:32:46.78 --> 00:32:48.50
So that thing better be strong, right?

560
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:51.42
Hold itself up.

561
00:32:51.42 --> 00:32:53.66
But tall buildings aren't made rigidly.

562
00:32:53.66 --> 00:32:57.34
They're made with a little bit of flims, slim ziness on purpose.

563
00:32:57.34 --> 00:32:59.34
Tubzor, like movement.

564
00:32:59.34 --> 00:33:02.58
The various movements and vibrations that may or may not come about.

565
00:33:02.58 --> 00:33:04.38
So it's essentially the same thing.

566
00:33:04.38 --> 00:33:06.58
On the surface, you think, well, yeah, authoritarianism.

567
00:33:06.58 --> 00:33:08.66
That's the way you can't destroy it.

568
00:33:08.66 --> 00:33:12.62
You can't break it or nothing like that, but rather it's not how it works.

569
00:33:12.62 --> 00:33:16.62
If you're too rigid, right, you're just going to crumble when the wiggle start coming.

570
00:33:16.62 --> 00:33:18.34
When the earthquake starts coming, you know?

571
00:33:18.34 --> 00:33:23.10
Again, this is why humility is the most important aspect or characteristic for a leader.

572
00:33:23.10 --> 00:33:26.22
Because when you're humble, you're able to move a little bit.

573
00:33:26.22 --> 00:33:28.34
You're able to take on new ideas.

574
00:33:28.34 --> 00:33:32.34
You're able to sway when the earthquake comes and they're adjustments.

575
00:33:32.34 --> 00:33:36.34
You're not just crumbling and falling down.

576
00:33:36.34 --> 00:33:40.18
It cannot be stressed too strongly that in talking about authoritarianism, we have been

577
00:33:40.18 --> 00:33:43.86
discussing people towards one end of a continuum.

578
00:33:43.86 --> 00:33:46.46
This is important because this is a dichotomy.

579
00:33:46.46 --> 00:33:48.18
This guy couldn't quite put that.

580
00:33:48.18 --> 00:33:50.94
He couldn't grasp that concept like you're boy, right here.

581
00:33:50.94 --> 00:33:52.94
Yes, sir.

582
00:33:52.94 --> 00:33:56.14
Between, because you had a balance at dichotomy, but here's what he says, between this

583
00:33:56.14 --> 00:34:01.14
and the other can be found people with all shades of opinion on the various attitudes measured.

584
00:34:01.14 --> 00:34:06.30
The general point is this, when discussing a authoritarianism, no value judgment is intended.

585
00:34:06.30 --> 00:34:11.78
Few would dispute that in moderation, many of the traits which make up the authoritarian

586
00:34:11.78 --> 00:34:14.70
personality have value in society.

587
00:34:14.70 --> 00:34:19.82
Civilization requires that there be some repression of sex and aggression, some exercise

588
00:34:19.82 --> 00:34:24.18
of discipline and a modicum of conformity and ordinalliness.

589
00:34:24.18 --> 00:34:28.78
So there's aspects of that personality which are good and that's true in the military.

590
00:34:28.78 --> 00:34:31.74
In fact, the military got a little bit extra.

591
00:34:31.74 --> 00:34:34.38
Because you got to be a little bit more conformist because you got to get the teet-you

592
00:34:34.38 --> 00:34:38.46
know you got to be on board, but it attracts people that are too much.

593
00:34:38.46 --> 00:34:38.46
Yeah.

594
00:34:38.46 --> 00:34:43.38
A little bit fast forward here.

595
00:34:43.38 --> 00:34:48.30
In other respects, however, likelihood of above average levels of authoritarianism in military

596
00:34:48.30 --> 00:34:53.26
personnel may well contribute toward incompetence, particularly when the authoritarian

597
00:34:53.26 --> 00:34:59.98
has reached a level of command where flexibility and an open mind are mandatory for success

598
00:34:59.98 --> 00:35:05.22
to be more specific the personality traits of authoritarianism and the associated characteristics

599
00:35:05.22 --> 00:35:10.22
of the closed mind and obsessive character may contribute to incompetence in the following

600
00:35:10.22 --> 00:35:11.22
ways.

601
00:35:11.22 --> 00:35:18.22
One, since authoritarianism has been found to be more dishonest, more irresponsible, more

602
00:35:18.22 --> 00:35:25.22
untrustworthy, more socially conforming, more suspicious than non-authoritarians, they are unlikely

603
00:35:25.22 --> 00:35:29.10
to make successful social leaders.

604
00:35:29.10 --> 00:35:33.18
A foretarians will be less likely to understand enemy intentions.

605
00:35:33.18 --> 00:35:34.54
I never thought of that before.

606
00:35:34.54 --> 00:35:36.66
Actually, here's something new for Jocco.

607
00:35:36.66 --> 00:35:40.18
If you're a foretarian, you're less likely to understand what the enemy is doing because

608
00:35:40.18 --> 00:35:43.70
you can't even understand their perspective.

609
00:35:43.70 --> 00:35:49.30
And to act upon information regarding such intentions as conflict with the beliefs and preconceptions

610
00:35:49.30 --> 00:35:53.42
which the commander might hold.

611
00:35:53.42 --> 00:35:54.42
Makes sense.

612
00:35:54.42 --> 00:36:00.54
Okay, forgive me for all the analogies by the way, I'm just reading the comments.

613
00:36:00.54 --> 00:36:01.54
Now this time is cameras.

614
00:36:01.54 --> 00:36:04.78
Or for whatever, I need to do for two.

615
00:36:04.78 --> 00:36:05.78
They were accurate.

616
00:36:05.78 --> 00:36:10.30
The person who is different among people.

617
00:36:10.30 --> 00:36:13.06
We'll consider a camera, or a photograph, or whatever.

618
00:36:13.06 --> 00:36:16.74
You have high resolution, low resolution, kind of the situation.

619
00:36:16.74 --> 00:36:20.22
The authoritarianism seems like a low resolution scenario.

620
00:36:20.22 --> 00:36:23.74
Way more black and white, way more like, oh yeah, like freaking either.

621
00:36:23.74 --> 00:36:24.74
It's this way.

622
00:36:24.74 --> 00:36:27.98
And if it's not this way, then it's obviously the other way.

623
00:36:27.98 --> 00:36:28.98
But you get a high-res photo.

624
00:36:28.98 --> 00:36:30.98
It's like, oh, that's just black.

625
00:36:30.98 --> 00:36:33.14
Obviously, no, no, just look closer.

626
00:36:33.14 --> 00:36:34.14
It's kind of great.

627
00:36:34.14 --> 00:36:35.70
It's actually pretty dark gray.

628
00:36:35.70 --> 00:36:38.74
And then even within that gray, this darker and lighter shades of gray.

629
00:36:38.74 --> 00:36:39.74
Or is it called?

630
00:36:39.74 --> 00:36:41.38
Or, oh, well, colors.

631
00:36:41.38 --> 00:36:42.38
What, yeah, whatever.

632
00:36:42.38 --> 00:36:43.38
This one might be orange.

633
00:36:43.38 --> 00:36:46.62
This one might be salmon.

634
00:36:46.62 --> 00:36:47.62
Which is a color.

635
00:36:47.62 --> 00:36:48.62
Yeah.

636
00:36:48.62 --> 00:36:49.62
Egg shill.

637
00:36:49.62 --> 00:36:51.62
With a Romalean type.

638
00:36:51.62 --> 00:36:53.90
By the way, what's that from?

639
00:36:53.90 --> 00:36:54.90
I can't say.

640
00:36:54.90 --> 00:36:59.34
No, no, no, but see what I'm saying though, where you get a low-res situation.

641
00:36:59.34 --> 00:37:00.34
Yeah.

642
00:37:00.34 --> 00:37:01.34
Yeah, they don't get it.

643
00:37:01.34 --> 00:37:02.34
They don't know.

644
00:37:02.34 --> 00:37:03.78
And then you said, what they don't know what the enemies thinking.

645
00:37:03.78 --> 00:37:05.34
Yeah, because they see black.

646
00:37:05.34 --> 00:37:06.34
But the enemies not on black.

647
00:37:06.34 --> 00:37:09.06
They're over here on 38% great.

648
00:37:09.06 --> 00:37:10.34
Yeah, exactly right.

649
00:37:10.34 --> 00:37:12.22
So yeah, that's just the way it's working.

650
00:37:12.22 --> 00:37:13.22
It's soon saying.

651
00:37:13.22 --> 00:37:14.58
So you got to be, oh, I'm not saying you got to be.

652
00:37:14.58 --> 00:37:19.26
I'm just saying it might be as the book is demonstrating more efficient.

653
00:37:19.26 --> 00:37:22.70
Effective to have a more nuanced perception of what's happened.

654
00:37:22.70 --> 00:37:25.58
Some higher as to experience.

655
00:37:25.58 --> 00:37:31.50
In 1954, American research showed that people with a high score on tests of a foretarianism

656
00:37:31.50 --> 00:37:38.18
had greater difficulty than non-foritarians in recognizing threatening messages when these

657
00:37:38.18 --> 00:37:40.22
were presented visually.

658
00:37:40.22 --> 00:37:45.38
A year later, another study confirmed this finding with threatening words that were heard

659
00:37:45.38 --> 00:37:47.02
instead of seen.

660
00:37:47.02 --> 00:37:48.38
So someone that's a foretarian.

661
00:37:48.38 --> 00:37:51.10
They don't even, they just don't comprehend the world accurately.

662
00:37:51.10 --> 00:38:00.62
Look, that is now your metaphor just became more ample in that right there.

663
00:38:00.62 --> 00:38:02.18
They can't see as well.

664
00:38:02.18 --> 00:38:03.34
They can't see as clear.

665
00:38:03.34 --> 00:38:04.70
They can't see the nuance.

666
00:38:04.70 --> 00:38:07.38
They can't see the message.

667
00:38:07.38 --> 00:38:11.98
Three, the inability to sacrifice cherished traditions and accept technical innovations, the

668
00:38:11.98 --> 00:38:15.78
history of the machine gun, the tank, and the aeroplane contained striking as an evidence

669
00:38:15.78 --> 00:38:17.42
of this disability.

670
00:38:17.42 --> 00:38:20.30
In war, an ounce of calculation is worth a ton of intuition.

671
00:38:20.30 --> 00:38:21.94
It also saves many lives.

672
00:38:21.94 --> 00:38:26.14
Number four, the under estimation of enemy ability.

673
00:38:26.14 --> 00:38:28.98
Number five, and he's got whole sections about each one of these.

674
00:38:28.98 --> 00:38:30.58
That's where you got to buy the book.

675
00:38:30.58 --> 00:38:35.86
Number five, an emphasis upon the importance of blind obedience and loyalty at the expense

676
00:38:35.86 --> 00:38:39.74
of initiative and innovation at lower levels of command.

677
00:38:39.74 --> 00:38:43.46
So that's just, if you lose that.

678
00:38:43.46 --> 00:38:49.58
So if you're in charge of the company of soldiers and your focus is on getting them to

679
00:38:49.58 --> 00:38:54.90
be blindly obedient because you're an authoritarian, it's bad.

680
00:38:54.90 --> 00:38:58.74
And you're doing it at the expense of having decentralized command.

681
00:38:58.74 --> 00:39:01.18
Watch out for that.

682
00:39:01.18 --> 00:39:03.78
Got to beware.

683
00:39:03.78 --> 00:39:08.38
Number six, the protection of the reputations of senior commanders and punishment of those

684
00:39:08.38 --> 00:39:12.26
in the lower military hierarchy if they voice any opinion.

685
00:39:12.26 --> 00:39:15.94
Whoever valuable in itself implies criticism of those higher up.

686
00:39:15.94 --> 00:39:21.98
So they don't want to hear any pushback on anything, which is again, a start contrast

687
00:39:21.98 --> 00:39:23.78
to what I encourage all the time.

688
00:39:23.78 --> 00:39:27.94
Up and down the chain of command, I want pushed back from my team.

689
00:39:27.94 --> 00:39:29.18
My team isn't pushing back, actually.

690
00:39:29.18 --> 00:39:31.02
I'm nervous.

691
00:39:31.02 --> 00:39:36.14
Now I think I've got blind obedience, which I don't want.

692
00:39:36.14 --> 00:39:37.14
Number seven, close.

693
00:39:37.14 --> 00:39:41.46
We were related to the foregoing effects of authoritarianism is an individual's propensity

694
00:39:41.46 --> 00:39:48.06
to blame others for their own shortcomings.

695
00:39:48.06 --> 00:39:49.78
This is the opposite of extreme ownership.

696
00:39:49.78 --> 00:39:56.34
So the opposite of extreme ownership is authoritarian and blaming other people.

697
00:39:56.34 --> 00:39:59.34
When it's soccer if I was reading this book, right now, and it just wasn't working.

698
00:39:59.34 --> 00:40:05.30
It was all not massive enough.

699
00:40:05.30 --> 00:40:08.62
All my theories were wrong.

700
00:40:08.62 --> 00:40:13.06
For eight, the close relationship between authoritarianism and obsessive traits has also

701
00:40:13.06 --> 00:40:15.26
played a significant part of military incompetence.

702
00:40:15.26 --> 00:40:17.62
This is a matter which we discussed earlier.

703
00:40:17.62 --> 00:40:25.82
Suffice it to say that the worst excesses of bull and the clinging to an across-dick ritual

704
00:40:25.82 --> 00:40:32.14
have played not a not inconsiderable part in holding back the military machine.

705
00:40:32.14 --> 00:40:39.70
So when you are hyper-obsessed OCD on little things that don't matter, this is not going

706
00:40:39.70 --> 00:40:41.14
to help you.

707
00:40:41.14 --> 00:40:44.50
Number nine, there's one trait of the authoritarian personality which at first sight may

708
00:40:44.50 --> 00:40:51.58
seem to have nothing to do with military incompetence, a belief in supernatural forces.

709
00:40:51.58 --> 00:40:53.10
The contrary is in fact the case.

710
00:40:53.10 --> 00:40:57.62
As a general issue, since military decision should not be based upon a proper weighing

711
00:40:57.62 --> 00:41:03.54
up of facts, the introduction of metaphysical variables into decision-making necessarily contributes

712
00:41:03.54 --> 00:41:07.78
noise which decreases the probability of decisions being correct.

713
00:41:07.78 --> 00:41:13.94
Concern with what the stars, foretell, or hopes and occasionally fears of the divine intervention

714
00:41:13.94 --> 00:41:19.86
constitute prejudices which can bias decisions away from realism in towards a wishful

715
00:41:19.86 --> 00:41:22.34
fantasies.

716
00:41:22.34 --> 00:41:26.50
That's a weird one to me because you would think that the people that were anti-authoritarian

717
00:41:26.50 --> 00:41:32.02
would be more superstitious but we didn't run through all the examples of all kinds of examples

718
00:41:32.02 --> 00:41:33.02
of that.

719
00:41:33.02 --> 00:41:36.22
All kinds of examples throughout history of people that are authoritarian.

720
00:41:36.22 --> 00:41:40.82
I mean, Hitler is a good example because he was all into the occult and all that superstitious

721
00:41:40.82 --> 00:41:44.86
about stuff.

722
00:41:44.86 --> 00:41:48.74
One of the least, number ten, one of the least attractive aspects of the authoritarian

723
00:41:48.74 --> 00:41:54.02
personality is his generalized hostility, what the Berkeley researchers called vilification

724
00:41:54.02 --> 00:41:57.90
of the human, this was a trait that was manifested to such an extreme degree by members

725
00:41:57.90 --> 00:41:58.90
of the Nazi SS.

726
00:41:58.90 --> 00:42:03.78
They commit wholesale murder not just without guilt or shame, but perhaps most surprisingly

727
00:42:03.78 --> 00:42:06.14
without the slightest evidence of revulsion.

728
00:42:06.14 --> 00:42:16.82
Then he says, finally, there is the fact that authoritarianism itself, so damaging to military

729
00:42:16.82 --> 00:42:22.90
endeavor will actually predispose an individual towards entering upon the very career

730
00:42:22.90 --> 00:42:26.62
wherein his restricted personality can wreak the most habits.

731
00:42:26.62 --> 00:42:30.50
Because there's what I kind of opened up with saying today.

732
00:42:30.50 --> 00:42:35.86
People that have these tendencies are attracted to the military and he gives a following

733
00:42:35.86 --> 00:42:40.90
case study case 19, Cecil or Cecil.

734
00:42:40.90 --> 00:42:43.42
Yeah, I guess Cecil would be a girls name one.

735
00:42:43.42 --> 00:42:44.42
Yes.

736
00:42:44.42 --> 00:42:45.42
So Cecil is a male name.

737
00:42:45.42 --> 00:42:46.42
Yes, sir.

738
00:42:46.42 --> 00:42:47.42
More of a British name.

739
00:42:47.42 --> 00:42:49.82
I'm never met in American dude named Cecil of you.

740
00:42:49.82 --> 00:42:50.82
Yes, sir.

741
00:42:50.82 --> 00:42:51.82
Really?

742
00:42:51.82 --> 00:42:52.82
Yeah.

743
00:42:52.82 --> 00:42:53.82
No, just one.

744
00:42:53.82 --> 00:42:54.82
Was he from England?

745
00:42:54.82 --> 00:42:55.82
No.

746
00:42:55.82 --> 00:42:56.82
No, not again.

747
00:42:56.82 --> 00:42:57.82
No, not again.

748
00:42:57.82 --> 00:42:58.82
Cecil.

749
00:42:58.82 --> 00:42:59.82
Okay.

750
00:42:59.82 --> 00:43:00.82
Here we go.

751
00:43:00.82 --> 00:43:01.82
Wait, who's Cecil peoples?

752
00:43:01.82 --> 00:43:02.82
Oh, that's it.

753
00:43:02.82 --> 00:43:03.82
That's an actor.

754
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:06.14
No, isn't that a UFC guy?

755
00:43:06.14 --> 00:43:07.14
Cecil peoples?

756
00:43:07.14 --> 00:43:11.06
So UFC is a commentator or a ref, maybe?

757
00:43:11.06 --> 00:43:12.06
I think he's a ref.

758
00:43:12.06 --> 00:43:13.66
I'm drawing a blank for a reason.

759
00:43:13.66 --> 00:43:14.66
Cecil peoples, right?

760
00:43:14.66 --> 00:43:16.42
You know, I Cecil people shout out.

761
00:43:16.42 --> 00:43:17.42
All right.

762
00:43:17.42 --> 00:43:21.62
I am, if I, if I'm not mistaken, he's a referee.

763
00:43:21.62 --> 00:43:22.62
Early on.

764
00:43:22.62 --> 00:43:23.62
Get your phone and go.

765
00:43:23.62 --> 00:43:24.62
Go, go, go, go.

766
00:43:24.62 --> 00:43:25.62
Seriously.

767
00:43:25.62 --> 00:43:31.02
I, I kind of remember him being, yeah, you might be right.

768
00:43:31.02 --> 00:43:32.46
Might have been a judge.

769
00:43:32.46 --> 00:43:33.46
Maybe he was a judge.

770
00:43:33.46 --> 00:43:36.54
Yeah, he seemed like he had some weird background and bare knuckle fighting or something

771
00:43:36.54 --> 00:43:39.26
and then kind of got early UFC activities going.

772
00:43:39.26 --> 00:43:43.14
So, Pee, E. O. Pope Cecil peoples.

773
00:43:43.14 --> 00:43:46.74
Cecil peoples is, eh, there he is.

774
00:43:46.74 --> 00:43:47.74
Black guy.

775
00:43:47.74 --> 00:43:48.74
I need support.

776
00:43:48.74 --> 00:43:49.74
He's a judge.

777
00:43:49.74 --> 00:43:52.58
Why we need to support MMA judge Cecil peoples.

778
00:43:52.58 --> 00:43:55.58
But I don't, from what era?

779
00:43:55.58 --> 00:43:56.58
Hmm.

780
00:43:56.58 --> 00:43:57.58
What was his background?

781
00:43:57.58 --> 00:44:03.46
The era that I was watching UFC, which is probably like five years ago and before.

782
00:44:03.46 --> 00:44:05.82
So, this is the guy that you claim to know.

783
00:44:05.82 --> 00:44:12.06
I knew I worked with a guy at American Movers.

784
00:44:12.06 --> 00:44:16.06
Cecil, um, and then there's Cecil people.

785
00:44:16.06 --> 00:44:17.46
All right, check.

786
00:44:17.46 --> 00:44:22.26
So here's Cecil R. Who is an obsessive neurotic and I wasn't going to read this thing,

787
00:44:22.26 --> 00:44:24.66
but I kind of have to, and I'll tell you why, and we'll get to the end.

788
00:44:24.66 --> 00:44:28.90
His IQ was in the bright normal range, personality testing indicated that he was very dependent

789
00:44:28.90 --> 00:44:34.26
on his parents, but that they were seen as being emotionally remote and extremely demanding

790
00:44:34.26 --> 00:44:35.66
infancy.

791
00:44:35.66 --> 00:44:38.82
He expressed strong feelings of aggression and anger.

792
00:44:38.82 --> 00:44:43.22
He seemed most interested in the history of wars and in playing war games.

793
00:44:43.22 --> 00:44:47.78
He shot darts with vigor and delight in the therapist's playroom and if given a choice

794
00:44:47.78 --> 00:44:52.06
would choose war games, his parents said he refused to play with other children on

795
00:44:52.06 --> 00:44:56.66
last day, others did exactly what they told him what he told them to do.

796
00:44:56.66 --> 00:45:02.38
Cecil said, when he grew up, he wanted to be a general.

797
00:45:02.38 --> 00:45:05.66
So, there you go.

798
00:45:05.66 --> 00:45:10.62
That's the kind of personality we don't want joined in the military, but that is fired

799
00:45:10.62 --> 00:45:14.38
up to join the military.

800
00:45:14.38 --> 00:45:19.26
Next chapter 23, mothers of incompetence were going kind of heavy, not going to go to

801
00:45:19.26 --> 00:45:23.22
deep into this chapter because it's going a little bit into the psychology world, which

802
00:45:23.22 --> 00:45:28.22
again, I think this, some of the psychology is a little bit outdated.

803
00:45:28.22 --> 00:45:30.42
This is coming from me and I'm those psychologists.

804
00:45:30.42 --> 00:45:32.82
Sounds like a close mine scenario.

805
00:45:32.82 --> 00:45:33.82
We'll open it up.

806
00:45:33.82 --> 00:45:34.82
Okay, two points.

807
00:45:34.82 --> 00:45:35.82
Follow me.

808
00:45:35.82 --> 00:45:36.82
You caught me.

809
00:45:36.82 --> 00:45:37.82
I'm busted.

810
00:45:37.82 --> 00:45:41.30
For the reader, not previously versed in the psychology of authoritarianism, the preceding

811
00:45:41.30 --> 00:45:46.46
chapter may have come as something to surprise at first sight, the traits of orderliness,

812
00:45:46.46 --> 00:45:49.22
tough mindedness, obedience to authority.

813
00:45:49.22 --> 00:45:56.78
Punetiveness and the rest well may have seemed the very embodiment of hard-hitting masculinity

814
00:45:56.78 --> 00:46:00.22
ideally suited to the job of being a soldier.

815
00:46:00.22 --> 00:46:02.26
That is an epic statement, right?

816
00:46:02.26 --> 00:46:03.26
All that's exact.

817
00:46:03.26 --> 00:46:04.46
And that's what so many people think.

818
00:46:04.46 --> 00:46:08.38
So many people think that is what we look at foreign military.

819
00:46:08.38 --> 00:46:13.14
Unfortunately, as represented in the authoritarian personality, they are only skin deep,

820
00:46:13.14 --> 00:46:17.78
a brittle crust of defenses against feelings of weakness and inadequacy.

821
00:46:17.78 --> 00:46:21.78
The authoritarian keeps up his spirits by whistling in the dark.

822
00:46:21.78 --> 00:46:22.78
He is frightened.

823
00:46:22.78 --> 00:46:26.90
He is the frightened child who wears the armor of a giant.

824
00:46:26.90 --> 00:46:31.70
His mind is a closed, is a door locked and bolted against that which he fears the most

825
00:46:31.70 --> 00:46:32.70
himself.

826
00:46:32.70 --> 00:46:37.42
I didn't get much out of that, but when I did get a lot out of, when I did get a lot out

827
00:46:37.42 --> 00:46:43.14
of his the fact that when you hear these personality traits, tough mindedness, obedience

828
00:46:43.14 --> 00:46:45.18
to authority, it sounds like that's what you want.

829
00:46:45.18 --> 00:46:48.70
You want people to be, you want to answer, you want your soldier to be, you don't.

830
00:46:48.70 --> 00:46:49.70
It's not what you want.

831
00:46:49.70 --> 00:46:54.70
It's not what we're looking for.

832
00:46:54.70 --> 00:46:57.02
Fast forward a little bit.

833
00:46:57.02 --> 00:46:59.78
Before going on, there's one further point of concerns, the distinction that has been drawn

834
00:46:59.78 --> 00:47:05.18
between irrational authoritarianism as dealt with here and so called rational authoritarianism.

835
00:47:05.18 --> 00:47:10.74
So this is just a clarification here.

836
00:47:10.74 --> 00:47:17.62
By the latter is meant the readiness to accept the no-bay, the dictates of irrational authority.

837
00:47:17.62 --> 00:47:18.62
Cool.

838
00:47:18.62 --> 00:47:19.62
There's such a thing.

839
00:47:19.62 --> 00:47:22.98
He's basically making a distinction here.

840
00:47:22.98 --> 00:47:30.94
An irrational, antipathy toward all authority is evident in some cases of student militancy,

841
00:47:30.94 --> 00:47:35.82
may just be, maybe just as neurotic as non-adaptive as a predisposition toward irrational

842
00:47:35.82 --> 00:47:36.82
authoritarianism.

843
00:47:36.82 --> 00:47:42.74
The common denominator of irrational authoritarianism and blind anarchy is that both states

844
00:47:42.74 --> 00:47:49.54
of mind are compulsive and derived from an underlying ego pathology.

845
00:47:49.54 --> 00:47:54.14
In fact, this distinction between rational and irrational authoritarianism has been implied

846
00:47:54.14 --> 00:47:55.38
throughout this book.

847
00:47:55.38 --> 00:47:59.94
Without the exercise, this is why I had to read this part, without the exercise and acceptance

848
00:47:59.94 --> 00:48:06.14
of rational authority, without certain minimal levels of discipline, and even without certain

849
00:48:06.14 --> 00:48:10.78
features of bullshit, military organizations would cease to function.

850
00:48:10.78 --> 00:48:17.22
This is something I have to talk about sometime with clients at Esslime Front because

851
00:48:17.22 --> 00:48:21.34
decentralized command, we want to have decentralized command, decentralized command, we want

852
00:48:21.34 --> 00:48:24.90
subordinates to be able to make choices and make decisions.

853
00:48:24.90 --> 00:48:29.26
And occasionally I'll get a group that's going to wild with that.

854
00:48:29.26 --> 00:48:32.58
And all of a sudden, we're nothing is centralized anymore.

855
00:48:32.58 --> 00:48:39.62
And I have to bring up the fact that, hey, guess what kind of uniform every guy in task

856
00:48:39.62 --> 00:48:41.94
in a bruiser or a matching uniform?

857
00:48:41.94 --> 00:48:42.94
Why?

858
00:48:42.94 --> 00:48:46.46
Because we couldn't have some guy that was wearing a pair of blue jeans and a sweatshirt

859
00:48:46.46 --> 00:48:50.86
out in Ramadi because they would look, they wouldn't look the same.

860
00:48:50.86 --> 00:48:52.02
And therefore they get shot.

861
00:48:52.02 --> 00:48:53.62
What happens if I run out of bullets?

862
00:48:53.62 --> 00:48:54.62
Guess what?

863
00:48:54.62 --> 00:48:57.62
I can get bullets from someone else and because we're all using the same weapon.

864
00:48:57.62 --> 00:48:59.98
What about my radio?

865
00:48:59.98 --> 00:49:03.30
I can use my radio and I can pick up your radio and use it to why because we're using

866
00:49:03.30 --> 00:49:04.30
the same radio.

867
00:49:04.30 --> 00:49:10.38
So you have to have some level of centralization, some level of authoritarianism that

868
00:49:10.38 --> 00:49:14.22
we're all going to kind of be on the same page.

869
00:49:14.22 --> 00:49:18.10
He says then, it's necessary to labor this point because of some of the semantic confusion

870
00:49:18.10 --> 00:49:20.54
regarding the term authoritarian.

871
00:49:20.54 --> 00:49:25.26
Throughout this book, it refers to irrational authoritarianism for the so-called rational

872
00:49:25.26 --> 00:49:31.06
foretars and we prefer the praise, autocratic behavior, the terms are not synonymous.

873
00:49:31.06 --> 00:49:34.42
Whereas the autocratic exercise of tight control in the situation demands that the authoritarian

874
00:49:34.42 --> 00:49:39.02
is himself tightly controlled no matter what the external situation.

875
00:49:39.02 --> 00:49:42.38
A little semantics there.

876
00:49:42.38 --> 00:49:51.50
He goes in this next chapter, education of the cult of muscular Christianity.

877
00:49:51.50 --> 00:49:59.58
This is where he starts talking about the British schools, how these kids were raised

878
00:49:59.58 --> 00:50:04.22
in sort of like this musk, what he calls muscular Christianity, not kids, but some of the

879
00:50:04.22 --> 00:50:08.26
kids in this timeframe were raised this way.

880
00:50:08.26 --> 00:50:13.50
Here's some of the things that are highlighted by the reasons for this stultifying educational

881
00:50:13.50 --> 00:50:20.02
program are no doubt many and various, but to deserve particular consideration.

882
00:50:20.02 --> 00:50:23.86
So this is the education program that some of these kids were subjected to.

883
00:50:23.86 --> 00:50:29.10
The first resides in the belief that enforced application to unpleasant boring tasks develops

884
00:50:29.10 --> 00:50:36.06
character and the second that any truly intellectual exercise by which is meant the cultivation

885
00:50:36.06 --> 00:50:41.58
of independent thinking as opposed to wrote learning harms that fine sense of loyalty

886
00:50:41.58 --> 00:50:50.70
and obedience which such schools strive to inculcate to think is to question and to question

887
00:50:50.70 --> 00:50:51.90
is to have doubts.

888
00:50:51.90 --> 00:50:57.42
So you get some examples of how these kids were raised, what they did at these schools,

889
00:50:57.42 --> 00:51:02.90
they were playing sports, they were do hazing rituals and memorizing things and it was

890
00:51:02.90 --> 00:51:06.66
all, I mean this is this is true to this day, we've got this sort of school system which

891
00:51:06.66 --> 00:51:08.74
is meant to teach you to be a good worker.

892
00:51:08.74 --> 00:51:10.54
That's what it's meant to do.

893
00:51:10.54 --> 00:51:13.42
It's meant to teach you to be a good worker.

894
00:51:13.42 --> 00:51:16.22
They don't want, that's why they structure things.

895
00:51:16.22 --> 00:51:20.42
It's like hey, some of the stuff that you learn in school has no value whatsoever.

896
00:51:20.42 --> 00:51:25.54
They're just trying to get you to follow the rules, do what they say, get on board with

897
00:51:25.54 --> 00:51:29.86
the program, follow in line with the authoritarian rulers.

898
00:51:29.86 --> 00:51:31.90
So we gotta be careful of that.

899
00:51:31.90 --> 00:51:38.46
Yeah, yeah, sometimes you feel like they, or whatever they are, are doing it on purpose

900
00:51:38.46 --> 00:51:43.22
and sometimes you just feel like, I think this is just some curriculum that no one had

901
00:51:43.22 --> 00:51:47.10
the like gusts to do to just be like hey, we're doing it overhaul.

902
00:51:47.10 --> 00:51:48.82
Yeah, I think you're right.

903
00:51:48.82 --> 00:51:54.26
I think that at some point, like right now, let's face it, if you would go ground zero

904
00:51:54.26 --> 00:51:57.54
and restart your educational system and America would be totally different than it is right

905
00:51:57.54 --> 00:51:58.54
now.

906
00:51:58.54 --> 00:51:59.54
Yeah.

907
00:51:59.54 --> 00:52:00.54
Well, it is slowly changing.

908
00:52:00.54 --> 00:52:03.58
It is slowly changing and I'm not even sure that the way that they're changing is the right

909
00:52:03.58 --> 00:52:04.58
direction.

910
00:52:04.58 --> 00:52:07.46
I think they're taking advantage of the fact that it might not have been the best and they're

911
00:52:07.46 --> 00:52:10.22
changing it to make it worse in some cases.

912
00:52:10.22 --> 00:52:14.46
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think in a, from a social standpoint, I think they might have

913
00:52:14.46 --> 00:52:16.90
kind of too hard in a certain direction.

914
00:52:16.90 --> 00:52:18.38
Kind of crazy sometimes.

915
00:52:18.38 --> 00:52:19.90
What kids are learning in school?

916
00:52:19.90 --> 00:52:22.70
Did you start being in some cases, what kids are learning in school?

917
00:52:22.70 --> 00:52:23.70
Yeah.

918
00:52:23.70 --> 00:52:28.02
My only point of reference is my, the elementary school, so my kids go to school.

919
00:52:28.02 --> 00:52:30.70
I got the full spectrum from elementary school through college.

920
00:52:30.70 --> 00:52:31.70
I got it all.

921
00:52:31.70 --> 00:52:32.70
I got it all.

922
00:52:32.70 --> 00:52:37.42
Do you think, um, what was I just thinking about just now?

923
00:52:37.42 --> 00:52:39.78
And I'm not really in support of it.

924
00:52:39.78 --> 00:52:40.78
Yeah.

925
00:52:40.78 --> 00:52:41.78
Oh, okay.

926
00:52:41.78 --> 00:52:47.46
Do you think, and I don't know the answer to this, but I just, I do kind of consider the other

927
00:52:47.46 --> 00:52:52.70
side of this, you know, how you, how you, how you just said, um, the school kind of is structured

928
00:52:52.70 --> 00:52:54.66
to provide or to develop good workers.

929
00:52:54.66 --> 00:52:55.66
Right.

930
00:52:55.66 --> 00:52:59.66
Aren't most people workers anyway?

931
00:52:59.66 --> 00:53:00.66
Not necessarily.

932
00:53:00.66 --> 00:53:04.10
No, no, you want to know something what I think is messed up now is I think a lot of times

933
00:53:04.10 --> 00:53:11.26
the school right now is to develop people to go to college and feed the academic growth

934
00:53:11.26 --> 00:53:12.26
of colleges.

935
00:53:12.26 --> 00:53:13.26
Yeah.

936
00:53:13.26 --> 00:53:15.86
But even that, hey, we're just trying to get you to get, oh, you know, it'd be good for

937
00:53:15.86 --> 00:53:20.26
you to get a degree in, bringing basket weaving or whatever.

938
00:53:20.26 --> 00:53:21.94
And no one needs a degree in that.

939
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:23.74
There's a lot of degrees that you get that you don't need.

940
00:53:23.74 --> 00:53:25.46
If you want to learn about that stuff, go read about it.

941
00:53:25.46 --> 00:53:31.34
Don't pay $200,000 and go into debt to learn about something that has no, it doesn't

942
00:53:31.34 --> 00:53:32.50
give you a skill set.

943
00:53:32.50 --> 00:53:36.42
I always felt like a social problem to me.

944
00:53:36.42 --> 00:53:41.06
It felt like I don't freaking know when I was a kid.

945
00:53:41.06 --> 00:53:45.66
Not not a kid, but when I was, when I joined the military, I already, I used to use the

946
00:53:45.66 --> 00:53:46.66
term.

947
00:53:46.66 --> 00:53:49.06
I don't know if it's ever caught on or I don't know if I've ever heard it, but educational

948
00:53:49.06 --> 00:53:50.06
inflation.

949
00:53:50.06 --> 00:53:53.70
Because when I was a kid, if you dropped out of high school, you could still get a job and

950
00:53:53.70 --> 00:53:55.62
have a normal life.

951
00:53:55.62 --> 00:54:00.38
Then as I got to high school, it was, hey, it was you got to finish high school.

952
00:54:00.38 --> 00:54:03.34
If you don't finish high school, you can't get a job blah, blah, blah.

953
00:54:03.34 --> 00:54:05.14
Then it was that I joined the military.

954
00:54:05.14 --> 00:54:06.34
Thank God.

955
00:54:06.34 --> 00:54:07.54
I joined the military.

956
00:54:07.54 --> 00:54:11.90
But as I joined the military, it was, hey, you know, you really need to really get your,

957
00:54:11.90 --> 00:54:13.58
whatever, what's a two year degree?

958
00:54:13.58 --> 00:54:14.58
You're so serious.

959
00:54:14.58 --> 00:54:16.22
So she, you need to get your social, it's good, it's good.

960
00:54:16.22 --> 00:54:17.22
So good.

961
00:54:17.22 --> 00:54:18.22
And then it became matchers.

962
00:54:18.22 --> 00:54:21.06
And now you've got kids that are going to get in their masters and then they're

963
00:54:21.06 --> 00:54:22.38
doctorate.

964
00:54:22.38 --> 00:54:29.26
They spend, they spend their 33 years old, 35 years old, 29 years old.

965
00:54:29.26 --> 00:54:32.22
For their even getting a job.

966
00:54:32.22 --> 00:54:34.42
And they've backed up, I mean, this is all now.

967
00:54:34.42 --> 00:54:35.42
It's all common.

968
00:54:35.42 --> 00:54:41.98
Like everyone's racking up $3,400, $200,300,000 worth of debt.

969
00:54:41.98 --> 00:54:48.34
And the skill set that they got in whatever degree they got, it gets them a 29,000 of

970
00:54:48.34 --> 00:54:55.30
not gonna probably not probably a $38,000 a year job as a whatever, you know, whatever.

971
00:54:55.30 --> 00:54:56.30
Right?

972
00:54:56.30 --> 00:55:00.34
Right?

973
00:55:00.34 --> 00:55:01.06
Whereas if you would have gone to, if you would have dropped out of high school and become an apprentice

974
00:55:01.06 --> 00:55:06.26
welder right now, you'd be making 128 grand a year because you're a hard worker.

975
00:55:06.26 --> 00:55:09.78
And by the way, if you're smart, you start, you know, you get, you figure out that welding

976
00:55:09.78 --> 00:55:14.38
thing and you buy a couple welding, a couple welding machines.

977
00:55:14.38 --> 00:55:17.58
And you're like, you know what I can get to guys, I can apprentice them, I can teach them.

978
00:55:17.58 --> 00:55:18.86
Boom, you can grow.

979
00:55:18.86 --> 00:55:20.30
You can make stuff happen.

980
00:55:20.30 --> 00:55:25.22
Meanwhile, the person that has $38,000 a year job, they actually have no skill set.

981
00:55:25.22 --> 00:55:33.14
So, I think a lot of the educational system right now is a feeder program for the college system,

982
00:55:33.14 --> 00:55:37.26
which is gonna charge people money and this is sort of like the housing crash too.

983
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:42.70
So the housing crash came because the government was loaning money or backing up loans

984
00:55:42.70 --> 00:55:45.74
to people that aren't gonna be able to afford it.

985
00:55:45.74 --> 00:55:50.70
That was what one of the causes, one of the primary causing of the housing crash.

986
00:55:50.70 --> 00:55:55.14
Right now, the government backs up these loans that these people get.

987
00:55:55.14 --> 00:55:58.62
And so they're allowed to get loans for $200, $300,000.

988
00:55:58.62 --> 00:56:03.54
And they don't realize it, they should, but they don't realize that, hey, you know,

989
00:56:03.54 --> 00:56:07.74
long it takes to pay off a $300,000 loan, which is by the way, is the only loan that you can't

990
00:56:07.74 --> 00:56:08.74
go bankrupt from.

991
00:56:08.74 --> 00:56:11.38
It's gonna, and you're making $39,000 a year.

992
00:56:11.38 --> 00:56:16.82
And by the way, my, my daughter just graduated college in the spring and a really good college.

993
00:56:16.82 --> 00:56:23.94
And her friends are making $39,000 a year, $42,000 a year.

994
00:56:23.94 --> 00:56:27.42
Like they're not making a lot of money.

995
00:56:27.42 --> 00:56:35.26
So I think a lot of the, what used to feed the workers, now feeds into this, into this educational

996
00:56:35.26 --> 00:56:39.18
nightmare of college debt and loans and all that.

997
00:56:39.18 --> 00:56:42.10
That's what's kind of nice about what we're doing at origin because at origin, you don't

998
00:56:42.10 --> 00:56:43.10
need to college education.

999
00:56:43.10 --> 00:56:45.86
You can go get a job and get a skill.

1000
00:56:45.86 --> 00:56:46.86
We have a career.

1001
00:56:46.86 --> 00:56:47.86
Right.

1002
00:56:47.86 --> 00:56:52.42
And we got people that have careers now that have learned to skill, that's a highly valuable

1003
00:56:52.42 --> 00:56:53.82
skill.

1004
00:56:53.82 --> 00:56:59.94
And they don't have any debt because they didn't go and study basket weaving for four years

1005
00:56:59.94 --> 00:57:01.94
at $42,000 a year.

1006
00:57:01.94 --> 00:57:03.94
That's getting late.

1007
00:57:03.94 --> 00:57:05.94
And how he skits a better.

1008
00:57:05.94 --> 00:57:09.74
Oh, it almost seems like a basket weaving would be a better skill than some of the degrees

1009
00:57:09.74 --> 00:57:10.74
that people are getting.

1010
00:57:10.74 --> 00:57:11.74
Right.

1011
00:57:11.74 --> 00:57:12.74
I would basically be a skill.

1012
00:57:12.74 --> 00:57:14.74
You can sell baskets.

1013
00:57:14.74 --> 00:57:18.26
But they need to stop harassing basket weavers.

1014
00:57:18.26 --> 00:57:19.26
No, bro.

1015
00:57:19.26 --> 00:57:23.66
It's almost, but it feels, I'm not a economist.

1016
00:57:23.66 --> 00:57:26.74
Or nothing like this, you know that.

1017
00:57:26.74 --> 00:57:30.46
It kind of seems like that there's certain times and then the education is kind of like

1018
00:57:30.46 --> 00:57:32.18
trying to facilitate those times.

1019
00:57:32.18 --> 00:57:38.10
Let me have people running the education and then the times change and then education just

1020
00:57:38.10 --> 00:57:42.22
follows up with the change, but just way, way too late.

1021
00:57:42.22 --> 00:57:45.74
It might even be 50 to 70 years late.

1022
00:57:45.74 --> 00:57:46.74
But yeah.

1023
00:57:46.74 --> 00:57:48.30
And then things, so now think about it, consider that.

1024
00:57:48.30 --> 00:57:54.78
So now that now it changes from like just straight up factory workers to, you know,

1025
00:57:54.78 --> 00:57:57.10
a little bit more advanced workers types.

1026
00:57:57.10 --> 00:57:58.10
Right.

1027
00:57:58.10 --> 00:58:01.02
So now it's like, okay, really the change that should have been made long time ago is

1028
00:58:01.02 --> 00:58:04.82
for you to be influenced to go to college, get a higher education.

1029
00:58:04.82 --> 00:58:05.98
Right.

1030
00:58:05.98 --> 00:58:09.38
Because you have higher level jobs, generally speaking, you know, lower level jobs,

1031
00:58:09.38 --> 00:58:10.86
obviously can exist and all this stuff.

1032
00:58:10.86 --> 00:58:12.66
But just generally speaking, it's just general.

1033
00:58:12.66 --> 00:58:16.46
So boom, now everyone should be going to college long time ago.

1034
00:58:16.46 --> 00:58:17.54
They should be doing that.

1035
00:58:17.54 --> 00:58:20.94
If they want to get a degree that creates way more opportunities back then, there's not

1036
00:58:20.94 --> 00:58:23.26
all these crazy degrees like now there's plenty of degrees.

1037
00:58:23.26 --> 00:58:27.18
When I went to college, like they started doing this program called liberal freaking studies,

1038
00:58:27.18 --> 00:58:31.78
right, which in concept, concept, it's good.

1039
00:58:31.78 --> 00:58:36.74
The concept is good, but probably got to do is get your little degree approved.

1040
00:58:36.74 --> 00:58:38.42
And you can just study whatever you want.

1041
00:58:38.42 --> 00:58:42.06
Essentially, be like, yeah, my degree is in this, as long as the title was approved,

1042
00:58:42.06 --> 00:58:43.06
you can get it.

1043
00:58:43.06 --> 00:58:45.66
It's called liberal studies, but it's, and then you have a title for it.

1044
00:58:45.66 --> 00:58:49.26
Again, you start doing it just for the sake of getting a degree.

1045
00:58:49.26 --> 00:58:50.26
Right.

1046
00:58:50.26 --> 00:58:52.50
When you get out of college, you know, you, you could be jammed up.

1047
00:58:52.50 --> 00:58:56.54
That's what I just said exactly right, but okay, and that's the later part of it.

1048
00:58:56.54 --> 00:59:01.26
But so now you have, and when I say it's a social thing or it feels like a social thing,

1049
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:04.86
it's kind of like people are still stuck in that little zone that's like, it is

1050
00:59:04.86 --> 00:59:06.02
beneficial to go to college.

1051
00:59:06.02 --> 00:59:08.02
Because there was a point where it's not on that thing.

1052
00:59:08.02 --> 00:59:10.62
So you think that they think that, oh, what are you doing?

1053
00:59:10.62 --> 00:59:11.62
I'm going to go to college.

1054
00:59:11.62 --> 00:59:12.82
Because the day is going on the path.

1055
00:59:12.82 --> 00:59:13.82
Yeah.

1056
00:59:13.82 --> 00:59:14.82
And then it realized that it's not the path.

1057
00:59:14.82 --> 00:59:15.82
That's not the reality right now.

1058
00:59:15.82 --> 00:59:17.82
That's all much has changed.

1059
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:21.58
And then you have all these people who, like back in the day, you said people can drop

1060
00:59:21.58 --> 00:59:22.62
out of high school and get a job.

1061
00:59:22.62 --> 00:59:25.26
Because yeah, you can drop out of high school because all you have to do is know how to

1062
00:59:25.26 --> 00:59:28.34
read and do basic arithmetic and get a job somewhere.

1063
00:59:28.34 --> 00:59:32.94
Like at a factory or at it, you know, one of the jobs that were freaking prevalent for

1064
00:59:32.94 --> 00:59:36.78
those times as times change, you need a little bit more education now for these jobs.

1065
00:59:36.78 --> 00:59:37.78
What do you end on true?

1066
00:59:37.78 --> 00:59:38.78
What?

1067
00:59:38.78 --> 00:59:45.94
There are always, there's, I mean, there is massive jobs that are, you know, carpentry,

1068
00:59:45.94 --> 00:59:50.54
concretes or plumber, electrician, automatic drive.

1069
00:59:50.54 --> 00:59:55.74
Like there's all these jobs that you definitely do not need a college education to have.

1070
00:59:55.74 --> 00:59:56.74
Yes, sir.

1071
00:59:56.74 --> 00:59:57.74
Do not need it.

1072
00:59:57.74 --> 01:00:03.78
And those are awesome jobs and those, those, those people go out and build America.

1073
01:00:03.78 --> 01:00:06.74
But to your point, you're talking about right now.

1074
01:00:06.74 --> 01:00:11.74
Those jobs, fullies is, but here's two, you're point.

1075
01:00:11.74 --> 01:00:17.74
A lot of people would say, okay, hey, what should I do with my life?

1076
01:00:17.74 --> 01:00:23.06
And the first nine things that come up on their list are go to college, go to college,

1077
01:00:23.06 --> 01:00:26.66
go to college, go to college, where is it when I was in high school.

1078
01:00:26.66 --> 01:00:30.14
Maybe the first thing would be go to college, but the second thing was like becoming a

1079
01:00:30.14 --> 01:00:32.14
apprentice electrician.

1080
01:00:32.14 --> 01:00:35.38
You know, like I took electricity in high school.

1081
01:00:35.38 --> 01:00:39.82
I was saying that was kind of the social kind of, I think that was way more normal.

1082
01:00:39.82 --> 01:00:43.62
There wasn't, there wasn't the mandatory track to college.

1083
01:00:43.62 --> 01:00:48.14
And I think nowadays, almost every kid is being told, go to college, go to college, go

1084
01:00:48.14 --> 01:00:53.62
to college instead of saying, hey, you can go and become an apprentice electrician.

1085
01:00:53.62 --> 01:00:55.22
And that's a freaking great job.

1086
01:00:55.22 --> 01:00:56.98
And you can have a great life.

1087
01:00:56.98 --> 01:01:01.26
And you can contribute to society in a massive way, doing something you enjoy.

1088
01:01:01.26 --> 01:01:05.34
Because look, when I was in high school, I didn't want to be looking at books.

1089
01:01:05.34 --> 01:01:06.34
Right?

1090
01:01:06.34 --> 01:01:09.10
I would much rather be an electrician.

1091
01:01:09.10 --> 01:01:11.22
Much rather be an electrician.

1092
01:01:11.22 --> 01:01:12.22
Yeah.

1093
01:01:12.22 --> 01:01:18.06
And yeah, I think the zone where, okay, basically break it into these two things, where the

1094
01:01:18.06 --> 01:01:22.14
social influence, like, hey, you should go to college or you should whatever or it's okay

1095
01:01:22.14 --> 01:01:24.22
not to go to college, you can just get a job here, whatever.

1096
01:01:24.22 --> 01:01:26.58
This, that passes and changes through time.

1097
01:01:26.58 --> 01:01:30.34
The social, to me, the social part is lagging, like way behind the reality.

1098
01:01:30.34 --> 01:01:31.58
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

1099
01:01:31.58 --> 01:01:32.58
Yes.

1100
01:01:32.58 --> 01:01:36.38
That's a little zone where it was the best to go to college if you had that opportunity.

1101
01:01:36.38 --> 01:01:38.38
That was the zone.

1102
01:01:38.38 --> 01:01:41.70
Right now, socially, the influence is still in that zone.

1103
01:01:41.70 --> 01:01:44.10
They're still saying, it's starting to change, though.

1104
01:01:44.10 --> 01:01:47.06
You start to hear people being like, hey, college, you know, you're going to be able to

1105
01:01:47.06 --> 01:01:48.06
say that stuff.

1106
01:01:48.06 --> 01:01:50.02
Yes, but it's, I think it's still there.

1107
01:01:50.02 --> 01:01:55.90
The reality on the streets is bro, college is for a handful of people and that's it.

1108
01:01:55.90 --> 01:01:56.90
Yeah.

1109
01:01:56.90 --> 01:01:59.50
I want to say, yeah, there's people out there that are actually hiring.

1110
01:01:59.50 --> 01:02:00.90
They're not looking for college degrees.

1111
01:02:00.90 --> 01:02:03.66
And I'm talking to like, I think Peter Teal is one of them.

1112
01:02:03.66 --> 01:02:06.14
And he's out there saying, we'll test.

1113
01:02:06.14 --> 01:02:09.74
I don't know if they got a testing program, but they're saying we just want smart people.

1114
01:02:09.74 --> 01:02:11.46
It doesn't matter where you want to college or not.

1115
01:02:11.46 --> 01:02:12.86
That's, or freaking legit.

1116
01:02:12.86 --> 01:02:17.62
And here's how you know, here's how you kind of, it's kind of like a finger on the

1117
01:02:17.62 --> 01:02:18.62
pot.

1118
01:02:18.62 --> 01:02:21.46
Like this is how you can kind of tell that people are still in the zone of like college is a good

1119
01:02:21.46 --> 01:02:22.46
thing.

1120
01:02:22.46 --> 01:02:26.78
You can be like, oh, yeah, that guy has a degree from Harvard.

1121
01:02:26.78 --> 01:02:29.22
It's like a total appeal appeal to authority.

1122
01:02:29.22 --> 01:02:33.14
The college being the authority by the way, you don't even have to say what he has a degree

1123
01:02:33.14 --> 01:02:34.14
from.

1124
01:02:34.14 --> 01:02:36.02
You can say he has a degree from Harvard.

1125
01:02:36.02 --> 01:02:39.50
And that automatically, I'm not saying that's it, but I'm just saying that in and

1126
01:02:39.50 --> 01:02:42.34
of itself is a point, like a positive thing.

1127
01:02:42.34 --> 01:02:43.34
Yeah.

1128
01:02:43.34 --> 01:02:44.34
I'm saying.

1129
01:02:44.34 --> 01:02:45.34
Yeah.

1130
01:02:45.34 --> 01:02:46.58
You can ask the zone, there'll be like so.

1131
01:02:46.58 --> 01:02:47.58
What's it in?

1132
01:02:47.58 --> 01:02:48.58
What's he doing?

1133
01:02:48.58 --> 01:02:50.74
What's one is I actually hear that right now.

1134
01:02:50.74 --> 01:02:55.74
I'm starting to, I, and people that I know for sure are starting to hear like, oh,

1135
01:02:55.74 --> 01:02:57.54
that person has their MBA or whatever.

1136
01:02:57.54 --> 01:02:58.54
Yeah, whatever.

1137
01:02:58.54 --> 01:03:00.54
Yeah, it's a we're already getting there.

1138
01:03:00.54 --> 01:03:02.06
It's not getting there.

1139
01:03:02.06 --> 01:03:06.06
But when moving in that direction, I hear of those comments.

1140
01:03:06.06 --> 01:03:07.06
Check.

1141
01:03:07.06 --> 01:03:09.06
Back to education here.

1142
01:03:09.06 --> 01:03:14.14
Finally, and perhaps the most fatal of all the private schools ethic of honor and fair

1143
01:03:14.14 --> 01:03:15.14
play.

1144
01:03:15.14 --> 01:03:21.02
So admirable in itself leads to disastrous results when mistakenly imputed to those like

1145
01:03:21.02 --> 01:03:23.78
Hitler who play the game by different center rules.

1146
01:03:23.78 --> 01:03:27.06
So these kids were told, hey, you got to follow the rules.

1147
01:03:27.06 --> 01:03:28.58
And this we play with honor.

1148
01:03:28.58 --> 01:03:29.66
And then Hitler's like, oh, really?

1149
01:03:29.66 --> 01:03:30.86
Watch this.

1150
01:03:30.86 --> 01:03:36.30
This particular weakness of military endeavor continued to feature in many subsequent

1151
01:03:36.30 --> 01:03:37.30
campaigns.

1152
01:03:37.30 --> 01:03:43.02
Indeed is no exaggeration to say that an absence of adequate reconnaissance that refusal

1153
01:03:43.02 --> 01:03:48.66
to believe intelligence reports and a general horror of spying have tended to keep our

1154
01:03:48.66 --> 01:03:52.42
armies wrapped in cocoons of catastrophic ignorance.

1155
01:03:52.42 --> 01:03:56.66
This fatal preference for honorable ignorance rather than useful knowledge, clean by

1156
01:03:56.66 --> 01:04:02.58
devious means was not confined to soldiers in the field, but as an attitude of mind permeated

1157
01:04:02.58 --> 01:04:05.06
the highest levels of all military intelligence.

1158
01:04:05.06 --> 01:04:08.58
So another thing, this is what these kids got educated to do.

1159
01:04:08.58 --> 01:04:11.30
They got educated to live with honor.

1160
01:04:11.30 --> 01:04:12.62
That means we're not going to sneak around.

1161
01:04:12.62 --> 01:04:13.62
We're not going to cheat.

1162
01:04:13.62 --> 01:04:14.98
I had to watch out for that.

1163
01:04:14.98 --> 01:04:18.54
Sometimes you get the like, well, I, these for cowards.

1164
01:04:18.54 --> 01:04:19.94
Like, okay, we get it.

1165
01:04:19.94 --> 01:04:20.94
That's for cowards.

1166
01:04:20.94 --> 01:04:21.94
But as well.

1167
01:04:21.94 --> 01:04:22.94
I, E.D.s, roadside.

1168
01:04:22.94 --> 01:04:24.54
All right, we try to go that out.

1169
01:04:24.54 --> 01:04:25.54
You know, that's a coward.

1170
01:04:25.54 --> 01:04:26.54
Yeah, sure.

1171
01:04:26.54 --> 01:04:27.54
It is.

1172
01:04:27.54 --> 01:04:28.54
Guess what?

1173
01:04:28.54 --> 01:04:30.22
We have to contend with it just because it's cowardly.

1174
01:04:30.22 --> 01:04:31.22
It doesn't mean it's going to go away.

1175
01:04:31.22 --> 01:04:34.42
It doesn't mean it doesn't produce dead bodies and main bodies.

1176
01:04:34.42 --> 01:04:36.54
Is it cowardly?

1177
01:04:36.54 --> 01:04:37.54
Yes, it is.

1178
01:04:37.54 --> 01:04:38.54
How do we counter it?

1179
01:04:38.54 --> 01:04:39.54
Hmm.

1180
01:04:39.54 --> 01:04:42.62
So you put some sniper overwatch on some roads and shwack some people.

1181
01:04:42.62 --> 01:04:44.54
That's how you counter it.

1182
01:04:44.54 --> 01:04:51.74
Like a reformed, because enormously successful, burglar, who self-righteously puts down his

1183
01:04:51.74 --> 01:04:58.50
gemmy to take up proselytizing on the evils of crime, we took to repudiating these very

1184
01:04:58.50 --> 01:05:05.02
traits, push cleverness, ruthless and sheer naked aggression that it put us where we are.

1185
01:05:05.02 --> 01:05:10.42
The reason that, so what he's saying is, you like a criminal that sort of makes it and

1186
01:05:10.42 --> 01:05:14.18
like all of a sudden puts down his thieving tools and starts saying, you know, thieving

1187
01:05:14.18 --> 01:05:16.06
it's bad and you're going to be right just wet.

1188
01:05:16.06 --> 01:05:18.50
But he's forgetting about how he got there.

1189
01:05:18.50 --> 01:05:22.30
And what he's what the point he's making here is we can have a tendency to do that.

1190
01:05:22.30 --> 01:05:28.90
Like, hey, in war, if you got to be brutal, we're on top because we were brutal.

1191
01:05:28.90 --> 01:05:33.94
We're on top because we spied and you know, broke shit and killed people.

1192
01:05:33.94 --> 01:05:36.78
That's what got us here and we can't now set up here.

1193
01:05:36.78 --> 01:05:39.90
So let's all roll.

1194
01:05:39.90 --> 01:05:43.06
You got to be careful about that.

1195
01:05:43.06 --> 01:05:49.30
Now we get to part three of this book.

1196
01:05:49.30 --> 01:05:52.50
Interestingly enough, you want to hear what quote it starts off, there's no bad regiments

1197
01:05:52.50 --> 01:05:53.50
only bad officers.

1198
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:55.62
All right, we've heard Napoleon say it.

1199
01:05:55.62 --> 01:06:02.10
We've heard hackworth said, we've heard echelon front say we know that quote is an extreme

1200
01:06:02.10 --> 01:06:03.10
ownership.

1201
01:06:03.10 --> 01:06:04.26
Well, it's we're using a different quote.

1202
01:06:04.26 --> 01:06:07.62
No bad teams, only bad leaders is what we said.

1203
01:06:07.62 --> 01:06:08.62
Did we steal it?

1204
01:06:08.62 --> 01:06:12.34
Yes, we stole it from hackworth.

1205
01:06:12.34 --> 01:06:20.50
And hackworth steal it from field martial lord slim who is in World War I World War II wounded

1206
01:06:20.50 --> 01:06:25.30
three times and guess what, he stole it from Napoleon.

1207
01:06:25.30 --> 01:06:26.30
So we're stealing it.

1208
01:06:26.30 --> 01:06:27.30
We're using it.

1209
01:06:27.30 --> 01:06:28.30
Can't steal.

1210
01:06:28.30 --> 01:06:29.30
It's free.

1211
01:06:29.30 --> 01:06:30.30
Okay.

1212
01:06:30.30 --> 01:06:33.30
We're attributing.

1213
01:06:33.30 --> 01:06:38.90
Also too much of history is written as though men had no feelings, no childhood, no bodily

1214
01:06:38.90 --> 01:06:49.38
senses, which is something that I have tried with all my might, with this podcast to make

1215
01:06:49.38 --> 01:06:53.58
sure that history is written.

1216
01:06:53.58 --> 01:07:00.14
And it's clear that these men had feelings, had bodily senses, had childhoods and beyond

1217
01:07:00.14 --> 01:07:02.50
that had hopes and dreams for the future.

1218
01:07:02.50 --> 01:07:06.06
A lot of histories not written like that.

1219
01:07:06.06 --> 01:07:07.58
Section here called the worst and the best.

1220
01:07:07.58 --> 01:07:12.78
So now what he does is he starts pointing out some, and this is why I can start moving a

1221
01:07:12.78 --> 01:07:13.78
little bit faster.

1222
01:07:13.78 --> 01:07:16.66
I told you before we started recording like, hey, there's a big chunk of the book we're

1223
01:07:16.66 --> 01:07:21.66
going to cover and cover and what podcast because he starts going into a lot of details

1224
01:07:21.66 --> 01:07:23.02
and it's worth reading.

1225
01:07:23.02 --> 01:07:25.58
You have to get the book if you want to read all these things.

1226
01:07:25.58 --> 01:07:31.90
But he starts pointing out the worst and the best of some of these military leaders.

1227
01:07:31.90 --> 01:07:36.06
He said this about Hitler or John Strauss and said this about Hitler in a war from which

1228
01:07:36.06 --> 01:07:40.86
so much human error had been eliminated by technological advances alone.

1229
01:07:40.86 --> 01:07:45.30
Human error was still the principal factor in determining wars outcome.

1230
01:07:45.30 --> 01:07:48.62
Hitler, slip knot.

1231
01:07:48.62 --> 01:07:49.62
A little bit about Hitler.

1232
01:07:49.62 --> 01:07:53.74
Hitler's particular brand of military incompetence is precisely what one would expect.

1233
01:07:53.74 --> 01:07:58.02
He showed a total unconcern for the physical and psychological welfare of his men and

1234
01:07:58.02 --> 01:07:59.02
his armies.

1235
01:07:59.02 --> 01:08:02.16
And we, man, when we covered Stalin Grot, remember when we covered Stalin Grot on this

1236
01:08:02.16 --> 01:08:03.16
podcast?

1237
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:05.46
Actually, a book called Stalin Grot.

1238
01:08:05.46 --> 01:08:14.58
He was written by a Nazi soldier and they were listening on the radio as they were surrounded

1239
01:08:14.58 --> 01:08:23.78
and they were listening to Hitler talk about praising their dying to the last man.

1240
01:08:23.78 --> 01:08:28.34
That's like insane.

1241
01:08:28.34 --> 01:08:32.58
Number two, his imperviousness to human suffering, which resulted in such enormous waste

1242
01:08:32.58 --> 01:08:37.38
of his own forces was a contributary factor in his stubborn refusal to ever relinquish

1243
01:08:37.38 --> 01:08:39.26
gained ground.

1244
01:08:39.26 --> 01:08:45.02
Three from his extreme ethnocentrism came another well-known form of military incompetence

1245
01:08:45.02 --> 01:08:50.18
that which results from a gross underestimation of the enemy and in particular of the ability

1246
01:08:50.18 --> 01:08:53.26
of civilian populations to withstand the effect of war.

1247
01:08:53.26 --> 01:08:54.26
Yep.

1248
01:08:54.26 --> 01:09:00.26
Thinking that your Nazi soldiers are just superior and then you come up against the Russians

1249
01:09:00.26 --> 01:09:03.34
civilians and they're like, what?

1250
01:09:03.34 --> 01:09:05.54
One play?

1251
01:09:05.54 --> 01:09:08.22
And thinking that they're just going to fold.

1252
01:09:08.22 --> 01:09:11.70
Thinking that the Russians are just the Russians civilian populace and even their

1253
01:09:11.70 --> 01:09:17.38
red army, which is, you know, bait up of, you know, peasant soldiers, they're going to

1254
01:09:17.38 --> 01:09:21.98
fold under the might of the Nazis.

1255
01:09:21.98 --> 01:09:25.30
You might want to check yourself, homey.

1256
01:09:25.30 --> 01:09:29.90
While many of foreign, while many of Hitler's decisions were military disastrous, his underlying

1257
01:09:29.90 --> 01:09:34.90
ego weakness and fear of criticism eventually in several other traits which are under

1258
01:09:34.90 --> 01:09:38.14
desirable to say the least in a military senior commander.

1259
01:09:38.14 --> 01:09:44.86
He promoted his AIDS and advisors for their sick of the C rather than their ability.

1260
01:09:44.86 --> 01:09:47.02
Just promote people because they sucked up to him.

1261
01:09:47.02 --> 01:09:50.78
He refused to accept, believe, or even listen to unpalatable intelligence and when things

1262
01:09:50.78 --> 01:09:56.10
got went really wrong, he was first to find scapegoats, opposite of extreme ownership,

1263
01:09:56.10 --> 01:09:58.70
promoting people because they kissed your ass.

1264
01:09:58.70 --> 01:10:01.46
Not listening to intelligence coming in.

1265
01:10:01.46 --> 01:10:05.34
This is having closed mind being an idiot.

1266
01:10:05.34 --> 01:10:10.94
Like his henchmen, himler, even Hitler, could on occasion show that over control of aggression,

1267
01:10:10.94 --> 01:10:16.46
that procrastination, which has incapacitated some other authoritarian military commanders,

1268
01:10:16.46 --> 01:10:20.18
perhaps his most disastrous decision of the war was when he halted the German advance

1269
01:10:20.18 --> 01:10:24.78
before Dunkirk, thus allowing the British to escape.

1270
01:10:24.78 --> 01:10:30.74
Finally on April 22nd, 1945, Hitler failed as a military commander in a way that he had never

1271
01:10:30.74 --> 01:10:34.82
failed before, and advocating responsibility he betrayed his command.

1272
01:10:34.82 --> 01:10:38.26
And if you're a Ben and leadership in duty like so, yeah, he quit.

1273
01:10:38.26 --> 01:11:02.66
He's the ultimate quitter, D.O.R.D.O.R.D.D.D., drop on request on April 22nd, 1945, and then a few days later, on April 30th, killed himself.

1274
01:11:02.66 --> 01:11:12.46
He was a good person dumb.

1275
01:11:12.46 --> 01:11:15.30
All those things, not stupid.

1276
01:11:15.30 --> 01:11:20.18
So you can be really smart and do really dumb things because you're authoritarian, because

1277
01:11:20.18 --> 01:11:22.98
your ego is out of control, etc.

1278
01:11:22.98 --> 01:11:26.78
Some good examples.

1279
01:11:26.78 --> 01:11:29.70
General Sir James Wolff.

1280
01:11:29.70 --> 01:11:33.70
He's bitterly and unfashionally opposed to what he called the spirit-breaking tactics of

1281
01:11:33.70 --> 01:11:35.82
harsh punishment and drill.

1282
01:11:35.82 --> 01:11:39.82
Was quite prepared to disobey orders if these conflicted with what he knew was right.

1283
01:11:39.82 --> 01:11:43.70
That sees us going through like these are the opposite of authoritarian personalities.

1284
01:11:43.70 --> 01:11:47.10
This guy's Sir James Wolff, I'm going to burn through some of these at the risk of making himself

1285
01:11:47.10 --> 01:11:48.10
on popular.

1286
01:11:48.10 --> 01:11:53.94
He forced his officers to attend the welfare of their men to visit their living quarters,

1287
01:11:53.94 --> 01:11:59.74
have regard for their health and generally get to know them as fellow human beings.

1288
01:11:59.74 --> 01:12:00.74
Wellington.

1289
01:12:00.74 --> 01:12:02.34
Next guy, he highlights here.

1290
01:12:02.34 --> 01:12:06.98
Wellington did not even science of emotional restriction, did not remain unmoved by human

1291
01:12:06.98 --> 01:12:07.98
suffering.

1292
01:12:07.98 --> 01:12:13.66
Suffering did not seek popularity was unimpressed by bull and did not seek scapegoats for

1293
01:12:13.66 --> 01:12:15.06
his military setbacks.

1294
01:12:15.06 --> 01:12:17.70
This is a good leader.

1295
01:12:17.70 --> 01:12:20.22
He spurned the decorations of authority.

1296
01:12:20.22 --> 01:12:23.90
Large staffs, centuries, gold braids.

1297
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:26.30
We didn't want to be all dressed up.

1298
01:12:26.30 --> 01:12:32.70
Wellington's self-confidence is also reflected in his refusal to make scapegoats of others.

1299
01:12:32.70 --> 01:12:37.86
Thus up the Burgos fiasco he said, I see that a disposition already exists to blame the

1300
01:12:37.86 --> 01:12:41.18
government for the failure of the siege of Burgos.

1301
01:12:41.18 --> 01:12:45.98
It was entirely my own act.

1302
01:12:45.98 --> 01:12:48.46
Thankfully he didn't put that into a book and call it extreme ownership.

1303
01:12:48.46 --> 01:12:50.58
Otherwise I would have been kind of out of luck.

1304
01:12:50.58 --> 01:12:52.78
Because that's what he did.

1305
01:12:52.78 --> 01:12:57.94
Here's the bad situation that unfolded during the siege and he took ownership of it.

1306
01:12:57.94 --> 01:13:01.10
Then blame anybody.

1307
01:13:01.10 --> 01:13:06.26
As usual after a battle his mood was set by the losses, not the glory.

1308
01:13:06.26 --> 01:13:12.34
On the morning after the siege, another Wellington showed himself to his deeply astonished

1309
01:13:12.34 --> 01:13:13.34
staff.

1310
01:13:13.34 --> 01:13:17.98
He visited the dead and on seeing so many of his finest men destroyed, he broke down and

1311
01:13:17.98 --> 01:13:22.98
swept.

1312
01:13:22.98 --> 01:13:30.14
Finally he displayed an open mind to new ideas, quick to innovate and see advantages in the

1313
01:13:30.14 --> 01:13:31.86
progress of technology.

1314
01:13:31.86 --> 01:13:38.30
Use remarkably laws a fair regarding the dress of his soldiers.

1315
01:13:38.30 --> 01:13:42.06
Thirdly he did not commit that cardinal error of so many military incompetence under

1316
01:13:42.06 --> 01:13:48.42
the rest of the enemy, he took infinite plans, pains and military planning, left nothing

1317
01:13:48.42 --> 01:13:52.06
to chance, selected officers for their efficiency, always did recon.

1318
01:13:52.06 --> 01:13:53.86
So you can see what he's getting out here.

1319
01:13:53.86 --> 01:14:01.50
Shaka, the Zulu King of his general ship that has been written.

1320
01:14:01.50 --> 01:14:07.02
Shaka's particular genius, laying his meticulous personal attention to detail and sheer

1321
01:14:07.02 --> 01:14:08.34
hard work.

1322
01:14:08.34 --> 01:14:12.82
If it all possible, he always insisted on inspecting everything himself in every one of

1323
01:14:12.82 --> 01:14:17.74
his critical battles he insisted on personal recon ordering the ground and the disposition

1324
01:14:17.74 --> 01:14:23.62
of enemy forces, he invariably checked all reports by procuring collateral evidence.

1325
01:14:23.62 --> 01:14:25.46
Shaka could also be humane.

1326
01:14:25.46 --> 01:14:31.90
He talks about Shaka actually being pretty brutal to his men, which I don't always

1327
01:14:31.90 --> 01:14:36.66
a little bit thinking, well, why are you trying to give this guy as this great example?

1328
01:14:36.66 --> 01:14:40.02
Who's who hesitated to follow his example in painful initiation where instantly clubbed

1329
01:14:40.02 --> 01:14:41.02
the death?

1330
01:14:41.02 --> 01:14:43.46
It seems a little authoritarian to me, bro.

1331
01:14:43.46 --> 01:14:44.46
Dixon, where are you at?

1332
01:14:44.46 --> 01:14:49.90
Well, I mean, if we're cutting some slack here, so here's the deal.

1333
01:14:49.90 --> 01:14:54.10
Another example of his flexibility and refusal to dominate a by tradition was Shaka's

1334
01:14:54.10 --> 01:14:56.34
banning of sandals for his fighting men.

1335
01:14:56.34 --> 01:14:59.98
By making them run barefoot, a considerable and by no means popular break with tradition,

1336
01:14:59.98 --> 01:15:04.22
he invested his army, the speed of movement, foreign access of that achievement by his enemies.

1337
01:15:04.22 --> 01:15:09.66
The displeasure he incurred through this innovation was hardly reduced by an order to his

1338
01:15:09.66 --> 01:15:14.46
warriors that they should harden their feet on the parade ground, stroom with thorns.

1339
01:15:14.46 --> 01:15:18.30
Those who hesitated to follow him in his example in this painful tradition were instantly

1340
01:15:18.30 --> 01:15:19.74
clubbed the death.

1341
01:15:19.74 --> 01:15:23.42
Seems a little authoritarian there, bro.

1342
01:15:23.42 --> 01:15:30.62
But Dixon says that Shaka could also be humane as well as punitive in caring for his

1343
01:15:30.62 --> 01:15:34.46
army to ensure that his fighting men were kept warm, well rested and well fed and orderly

1344
01:15:34.46 --> 01:15:37.22
was provided for every three soldiers under his command.

1345
01:15:37.22 --> 01:15:42.34
No battles fought without adequate supplies of food, water, and bark dressings being assembled

1346
01:15:42.34 --> 01:15:44.46
at strategic points beforehand.

1347
01:15:44.46 --> 01:15:49.62
It can be summed up as autocratic, totally non-authoritarian, high-enachievement motivation

1348
01:15:49.62 --> 01:15:52.66
and yet capable of great warmth and sympathy.

1349
01:15:52.66 --> 01:15:57.98
According to Ritter, he was highly emotional and sentimental behind a facade of iron-clad

1350
01:15:57.98 --> 01:16:01.94
iron self-discipline the fact that he was the finest composer of songs.

1351
01:16:01.94 --> 01:16:07.10
The leading dancer and wittyest punster suggests an artist who would naturally have a highly

1352
01:16:07.10 --> 01:16:14.78
strong nature and more sensitive than the comber common run of the Nungi race.

1353
01:16:14.78 --> 01:16:18.82
So there's Shaka Napoleon.

1354
01:16:18.82 --> 01:16:22.62
The evidence suggests that though he was ambitious ruthless, devious unscrupulous, grand

1355
01:16:22.62 --> 01:16:29.14
geos, despotic, Machiavellian, dictatorial and autocratic he was not authoritarian.

1356
01:16:29.14 --> 01:16:35.98
Again, this is where he's getting some semantics here that's kind of like, mmmm.

1357
01:16:35.98 --> 01:16:40.74
Napoleon could be the reverse of extra punitive, the fault to argue lay not so much

1358
01:16:40.74 --> 01:16:43.02
of the men as with himself.

1359
01:16:43.02 --> 01:16:48.14
So he, when things were didn't go the way he wanted, he often said it was his fault.

1360
01:16:48.14 --> 01:16:50.58
Cool.

1361
01:16:50.58 --> 01:16:55.02
I think he's stretching, man, on Napoleon.

1362
01:16:55.02 --> 01:16:57.10
Because I think it's a scale, right?

1363
01:16:57.10 --> 01:17:00.42
Napoleon, I think, had an open mind when it came to combat.

1364
01:17:00.42 --> 01:17:02.02
But I think he was an ego maniac.

1365
01:17:02.02 --> 01:17:03.26
We have a free what's that?

1366
01:17:03.26 --> 01:17:05.26
Napoleon complex, right?

1367
01:17:05.26 --> 01:17:09.70
You're all little and trying to be big.

1368
01:17:09.70 --> 01:17:14.30
Stern and Imperius II, in his business hours, Napoleon was all ease and sunshine to his

1369
01:17:14.30 --> 01:17:15.30
sentiments.

1370
01:17:15.30 --> 01:17:18.94
They admired his pleasant wit, his unaffected gate, he's rich and brilliant, handing of

1371
01:17:18.94 --> 01:17:20.54
moral and political themes.

1372
01:17:20.54 --> 01:17:25.22
And he's trying to make him out to be a little less authoritarian than he was in my opinion.

1373
01:17:25.22 --> 01:17:32.74
But some of these guy, even the guy Chuck Azulu, he was maybe he was authoritarian in certain

1374
01:17:32.74 --> 01:17:33.74
ways.

1375
01:17:33.74 --> 01:17:35.34
That's what I just said, it's a scale, right?

1376
01:17:35.34 --> 01:17:36.34
Or whatever in other ways.

1377
01:17:36.34 --> 01:17:38.30
And he kind of found Chuck a balance.

1378
01:17:38.30 --> 01:17:44.98
Yeah, so like back to Chuck, he would be not what is the one, what's the opposite of

1379
01:17:44.98 --> 01:17:47.42
authoritarian, authoritarian?

1380
01:17:47.42 --> 01:17:48.42
Libre, what's the opposite?

1381
01:17:48.42 --> 01:17:51.54
Well, yeah, he was anti.

1382
01:17:51.54 --> 01:17:54.74
Except when it came to those feet, man, those feet got it, you know, like, you got a

1383
01:17:54.74 --> 01:17:57.66
like, how you guys say, you got the line on some stuff.

1384
01:17:57.66 --> 01:18:00.50
You know, those radios, you got to know how to program your radios.

1385
01:18:00.50 --> 01:18:03.06
But the patches, that's like a little bit.

1386
01:18:03.06 --> 01:18:05.06
So Chuck was like that with a lot of stuff.

1387
01:18:05.06 --> 01:18:06.86
So man, Chuck, kind of keeping it real.

1388
01:18:06.86 --> 01:18:07.86
Kind of keeping it real.

1389
01:18:07.86 --> 01:18:09.70
Kind of keeping it real, you know.

1390
01:18:09.70 --> 01:18:10.70
But that's how, right?

1391
01:18:10.70 --> 01:18:11.70
That's the day caught him.

1392
01:18:11.70 --> 01:18:12.70
Yeah.

1393
01:18:12.70 --> 01:18:13.70
That's the day caught him in.

1394
01:18:13.70 --> 01:18:15.90
And I think that's, he's trying to point out some of that day caught him.

1395
01:18:15.90 --> 01:18:18.38
I think he's leaning to try and show these good leaders as being less of them.

1396
01:18:18.38 --> 01:18:19.38
authoritarian.

1397
01:18:19.38 --> 01:18:20.38
Yeah.

1398
01:18:20.38 --> 01:18:27.22
Because Napoleon, I mean, gusher, you know, Hitler, Napoleon, these guys like, yeah, they

1399
01:18:27.22 --> 01:18:30.14
lost and they lost huge and they're bad.

1400
01:18:30.14 --> 01:18:31.94
But they did some effective stuff.

1401
01:18:31.94 --> 01:18:36.62
Oh, yeah, well, Napoleon, I mean, Napoleon won a lot.

1402
01:18:36.62 --> 01:18:38.02
And Hitler won a lot too, man.

1403
01:18:38.02 --> 01:18:39.02
That's what I'm saying.

1404
01:18:39.02 --> 01:18:40.78
So let's crack kick in and off.

1405
01:18:40.78 --> 01:18:46.34
Took over giant swaths of Europe and Napoleon did the same thing.

1406
01:18:46.34 --> 01:18:50.98
So there was definitely some, they did some shit that was that they want.

1407
01:18:50.98 --> 01:18:51.98
It was effective.

1408
01:18:51.98 --> 01:18:52.98
Yeah.

1409
01:18:52.98 --> 01:18:56.58
And by the way, there's other people that were totally authoritarian that did authoritarian

1410
01:18:56.58 --> 01:19:01.78
shit and law and also want the Crimean War, right?

1411
01:19:01.78 --> 01:19:07.06
With the brits, the brits were doing the dumbest, most horrible authoritarian ego driven

1412
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:16.22
moves and getting guys killed by the bushel and yet they still were able to win.

1413
01:19:16.22 --> 01:19:19.54
This is a little bit more about Napoleon, finally like many of the other commanders on our

1414
01:19:19.54 --> 01:19:20.54
list.

1415
01:19:20.54 --> 01:19:22.30
Napoleon was without that vanity.

1416
01:19:22.30 --> 01:19:26.94
This like struck me bro, without that vanity which Patokan's a week ego was notoriously

1417
01:19:26.94 --> 01:19:30.86
careless about his dress, had a wide range of intellectual interests and promoted his

1418
01:19:30.86 --> 01:19:32.54
subordinates on the basis of their efficiency.

1419
01:19:32.54 --> 01:19:33.54
Okay.

1420
01:19:33.54 --> 01:19:34.54
So that's cool.

1421
01:19:34.54 --> 01:19:35.54
Makes sense.

1422
01:19:35.54 --> 01:19:39.02
Nor did he display the debilitating over control of aggression, which his on occasion

1423
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:44.86
is paralyzed, warlike behavior of less successful commanders.

1424
01:19:44.86 --> 01:19:45.86
Nelson.

1425
01:19:45.86 --> 01:19:53.74
Nelson did not display a compulsive concern with Ordea Lenniss if his dress was anxious to

1426
01:19:53.74 --> 01:19:58.58
give pleasure to everyone about him distinguishing each turn by some act of kindness and chiefly

1427
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:00.34
those who seem to require it.

1428
01:20:00.34 --> 01:20:04.02
The most Nelson seems like he's just a really good guy.

1429
01:20:04.02 --> 01:20:07.46
And he residual doubts one might have regarding Nelson's freedom from the crippling effects

1430
01:20:07.46 --> 01:20:13.50
of a week ego should be resolved by considering his most famous characteristic disobedience.

1431
01:20:13.50 --> 01:20:15.42
Possessing boundless moral courage.

1432
01:20:15.42 --> 01:20:21.06
He was himself prepared to disobey if he fought it to the advantage of his country.

1433
01:20:21.06 --> 01:20:22.38
And often he was right.

1434
01:20:22.38 --> 01:20:26.94
Nelson was in fact always urging others even allies, superiors and officials of the army

1435
01:20:26.94 --> 01:20:32.78
to disregard their orders if necessary and what he thought was to be the general interest

1436
01:20:32.78 --> 01:20:34.94
of the cause.

1437
01:20:34.94 --> 01:20:42.90
This is one of the best quotes on decentralized command I have ever heard in my life.

1438
01:20:42.90 --> 01:20:45.34
So this is Nelson.

1439
01:20:45.34 --> 01:20:52.06
Nelson's own view of this matter was uncomplicated as he said to the Duke of Clarence

1440
01:20:52.06 --> 01:21:00.18
to serve my king and to destroy the French I consider as the great order of all from which

1441
01:21:00.18 --> 01:21:03.02
little one spring.

1442
01:21:03.02 --> 01:21:10.54
And if one of these little ones militate against it for who can exactly tell at a distance

1443
01:21:10.54 --> 01:21:15.78
I go back and obey the great order and object.

1444
01:21:15.78 --> 01:21:19.18
That's a beautiful understanding of decentralized command.

1445
01:21:19.18 --> 01:21:20.78
Here's what we're trying to get done.

1446
01:21:20.78 --> 01:21:22.30
And there's a bunch of different ways you can get it done.

1447
01:21:22.30 --> 01:21:25.86
I'm telling you to do something but it doesn't quite make sense in supporting the strategic

1448
01:21:25.86 --> 01:21:26.86
goal.

1449
01:21:26.86 --> 01:21:27.86
Don't do it.

1450
01:21:27.86 --> 01:21:29.82
Do something else.

1451
01:21:29.82 --> 01:21:36.38
So that's a non-authoritarian mindset which is good to go.

1452
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:41.34
See Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia of his general ship, L'Adele Hart Row Lawrence can bear

1453
01:21:41.34 --> 01:21:46.98
comparison with Mar-Bron Napoleon in that vital faculty of general ship.

1454
01:21:46.98 --> 01:21:51.14
The power of grasping instantly the picture of the ground in situation of relating the

1455
01:21:51.14 --> 01:21:53.98
one to the other and the local to the general.

1456
01:21:53.98 --> 01:21:57.90
He was able to see what was happening not just what's happening right there but see it in

1457
01:21:57.90 --> 01:21:58.90
the big picture.

1458
01:21:58.90 --> 01:22:01.70
He was able to attach take a step back, look around.

1459
01:22:01.70 --> 01:22:06.26
I think strategic L'Adele Hart considered that Lawrence also showed the same profound

1460
01:22:06.26 --> 01:22:11.54
profound understanding of human nature, the same power of commanding affection while

1461
01:22:11.54 --> 01:22:16.70
commanding energy and the same consummate blend of diplomacy with strategy.

1462
01:22:16.70 --> 01:22:23.34
At a cool head, L'Adele Hart also considered that Lawrence the most widely read of generals

1463
01:22:23.34 --> 01:22:29.66
was more of a steep denogged of war than any other generals of the last one.

1464
01:22:29.66 --> 01:22:34.42
In personality, this one read a little bit more because well because this in personality

1465
01:22:34.42 --> 01:22:39.66
Lawrence is probably the least authoritarian senior commander of the world as ever known.

1466
01:22:39.66 --> 01:22:46.18
He was totally without personal ambition, refused promotion, honors and awards for himself

1467
01:22:46.18 --> 01:22:52.42
and deplored the pump, vanities and ritualized bowing and scraping which won associate with

1468
01:22:52.42 --> 01:22:57.54
the power structure of the hierarchical command systems.

1469
01:22:57.54 --> 01:22:58.54
We like this guy.

1470
01:22:58.54 --> 01:22:59.54
How do they get?

1471
01:22:59.54 --> 01:23:02.54
Yeah, we're down.

1472
01:23:02.54 --> 01:23:07.06
The fact that he could renounce his name for that of Ross and later Sean happily

1473
01:23:07.06 --> 01:23:13.62
resume his role of a lowly ranker after achieving worldwide fame indicates a degree of

1474
01:23:13.62 --> 01:23:18.38
self-effacement quite unique amongst military men.

1475
01:23:18.38 --> 01:23:24.42
Contrary to a characteristic predisposition of authoritarian individuals, Lawrence disliked

1476
01:23:24.42 --> 01:23:29.26
interfering with other men's freedom.

1477
01:23:29.26 --> 01:23:32.10
You can't impose on other people you shouldn't impose on other people you shouldn't

1478
01:23:32.10 --> 01:23:34.54
mess with their freedom.

1479
01:23:34.54 --> 01:23:41.78
He disliked giving orders and in fact exercised effective command largely through the

1480
01:23:41.78 --> 01:23:44.66
tendering of advice.

1481
01:23:44.66 --> 01:23:48.62
Have you ever heard of your late father and explained how many times I gave him a direct

1482
01:23:48.62 --> 01:23:49.62
order?

1483
01:23:49.62 --> 01:23:56.62
Oh yes, I have heard him explain the number.

1484
01:23:56.62 --> 01:23:58.10
Zero times.

1485
01:23:58.10 --> 01:24:02.10
That this advice was acted upon suggest that by his personality he achieved a level of

1486
01:24:02.10 --> 01:24:06.10
leadership rarely attained by military commanders.

1487
01:24:06.10 --> 01:24:10.86
He himself was prepared to obey foolish orders but disliked passing these on to others

1488
01:24:10.86 --> 01:24:16.34
as La Dal Hart remarks and war such orders are often the result useless sacrifice of men's

1489
01:24:16.34 --> 01:24:20.58
lives in peace they often contribute to the sterilization of men's reason.

1490
01:24:20.58 --> 01:24:22.42
Oh that's a good one.

1491
01:24:22.42 --> 01:24:27.86
You barco orders, you make people do what you want them to do, you're going to sterilize

1492
01:24:27.86 --> 01:24:31.10
their brain.

1493
01:24:31.10 --> 01:24:35.90
Lawrence was a great respect to reason and consider that the possession of knowledge was

1494
01:24:35.90 --> 01:24:38.42
of primary importance for a military leader.

1495
01:24:38.42 --> 01:24:43.06
In his opinion, quote, the perfect general would know everything in heaven and earth and

1496
01:24:43.06 --> 01:24:50.06
quote by the same token this most open minded of men deported the closed and vaccus minds

1497
01:24:50.06 --> 01:24:57.50
of his military compatriots of men who displayed a quote fundamental crippling, incuriousness.

1498
01:24:57.50 --> 01:25:00.30
There you go.

1499
01:25:00.30 --> 01:25:03.30
T.E. Lawrence.

1500
01:25:03.30 --> 01:25:07.98
We got slim who this thing kicked off with, general slim like so many generals when plans

1501
01:25:07.98 --> 01:25:08.98
have gone wrong.

1502
01:25:08.98 --> 01:25:11.30
Oh, you take a little bit of ownership here.

1503
01:25:11.30 --> 01:25:15.70
Like so many generals, as a quote, when so many generals like so many generals when plans

1504
01:25:15.70 --> 01:25:18.94
have gone wrong, I could find plenty of excuses.

1505
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:22.10
But only one reason myself.

1506
01:25:22.10 --> 01:25:27.70
When two courses of action were open to me, I had not chosen as a good commander should

1507
01:25:27.70 --> 01:25:28.90
the boulder.

1508
01:25:28.90 --> 01:25:33.18
I had taken counsel of my fears and bad reference.

1509
01:25:33.18 --> 01:25:39.06
There is no evidence here of that telltale defense projection and even though he had ample

1510
01:25:39.06 --> 01:25:43.34
opportunity for making scapegoats to those subordinates who had given the advice which

1511
01:25:43.34 --> 01:25:44.34
tended to failure.

1512
01:25:44.34 --> 01:25:46.02
So you got another guy slim.

1513
01:25:46.02 --> 01:25:52.62
Had he written a book and taken, you know, given it a cool title like extreme ownership.

1514
01:25:52.62 --> 01:25:56.50
We mean a different spot right now.

1515
01:25:56.50 --> 01:26:00.34
Taken into account with other traits as warmth towards his family is absence of rigidity

1516
01:26:00.34 --> 01:26:04.54
as parsimony with the lives of his men, his ability to improvise his popularity with

1517
01:26:04.54 --> 01:26:08.90
the troops and relative lack of concern regarding his popularity with his equals.

1518
01:26:08.90 --> 01:26:12.38
She had come as no surprise to learn that this shiverless, autocratic and most efficient

1519
01:26:12.38 --> 01:26:17.10
of generals enjoyed a happy childhood apparently unmarked by those stresses and strange

1520
01:26:17.10 --> 01:26:20.18
which may weaken the ego and stunt the personality.

1521
01:26:20.18 --> 01:26:23.22
He kind of, in I've been skipping these parts a little bit.

1522
01:26:23.22 --> 01:26:26.90
I'm guessing being a little bit biased, but I'm skipping a lot of the clothes like go

1523
01:26:26.90 --> 01:26:31.46
and analysis because you know that and I'm just giving you that little taste of them.

1524
01:26:31.46 --> 01:26:32.78
You want to get some of that.

1525
01:26:32.78 --> 01:26:36.30
You got to kind of get into it here a little bit.

1526
01:26:36.30 --> 01:26:39.78
His next section is exceptions to the rule.

1527
01:26:39.78 --> 01:26:41.82
Got a little quote here from Rommel.

1528
01:26:41.82 --> 01:26:46.54
One must not judge everyone in the world by his qualities as a soldier otherwise we should

1529
01:26:46.54 --> 01:26:50.22
have no civilization that's Rommel to his son.

1530
01:26:50.22 --> 01:26:52.38
Interesting.

1531
01:26:52.38 --> 01:26:58.02
In confidence is not confined to those who were extreme in their ineptitude but may operate

1532
01:26:58.02 --> 01:27:06.74
a long line of a continuum of military excellence from worst to the best senior commanders.

1533
01:27:06.74 --> 01:27:12.94
Military shortcomings of Montgomery, Kitchener and Hague and their positions along a dimension

1534
01:27:12.94 --> 01:27:16.18
of authoritarianism are perfectly correlated.

1535
01:27:16.18 --> 01:27:19.54
So this is what you were saying earlier.

1536
01:27:19.54 --> 01:27:24.78
It's not like, oh, this is either a authoritarian or you're not.

1537
01:27:24.78 --> 01:27:26.26
You could be anywhere on this spectrum.

1538
01:27:26.26 --> 01:27:30.86
And as we have been discussing, you want to have some level of authoritarianism.

1539
01:27:30.86 --> 01:27:31.86
You just don't want too much.

1540
01:27:31.86 --> 01:27:32.86
It's got to be a balance.

1541
01:27:32.86 --> 01:27:36.42
But some people can be, oh, they're a little bit in the red.

1542
01:27:36.42 --> 01:27:38.18
Some people full green.

1543
01:27:38.18 --> 01:27:39.66
Maybe some people too much green.

1544
01:27:39.66 --> 01:27:40.82
They're going to make it.

1545
01:27:40.82 --> 01:27:44.78
But I think in the military, people that are far green don't even join the military.

1546
01:27:44.78 --> 01:27:47.02
We got to remember that people might even in there.

1547
01:27:47.02 --> 01:27:51.66
So you already have a composite of people that are a little bit at least in the middle.

1548
01:27:51.66 --> 01:27:52.86
Maybe a little bit orange.

1549
01:27:52.86 --> 01:27:55.02
Some people lean in in the red.

1550
01:27:55.02 --> 01:27:58.30
And it's a continuum.

1551
01:27:58.30 --> 01:28:02.54
Talking about Montgomery, and again, you got to get, if you want the details of this,

1552
01:28:02.54 --> 01:28:03.54
read, get the book.

1553
01:28:03.54 --> 01:28:07.98
It's not my purpose to debate Montgomery's greatness of face to say that, while not without

1554
01:28:07.98 --> 01:28:13.06
blemishes, he was in the main, a highly competent commander, and as such needs to be considered

1555
01:28:13.06 --> 01:28:17.90
in present context, does he or does he not support the hypothesis that competence depends

1556
01:28:17.90 --> 01:28:22.38
upon an absence of authoritarianism and its associated traits.

1557
01:28:22.38 --> 01:28:24.86
So that's what we're really hearing there is that.

1558
01:28:24.86 --> 01:28:27.94
The more authoritarian you are, the worse you're going to be.

1559
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:31.66
Unless you have zero authoritarianism.

1560
01:28:31.66 --> 01:28:35.42
And he points out some things that makes him not authoritarianism.

1561
01:28:35.42 --> 01:28:36.42
Authoritarianistic.

1562
01:28:36.42 --> 01:28:40.26
Here's Montgomery lacked those obsessive traits, which tend to accompany authoritarianism.

1563
01:28:40.26 --> 01:28:44.70
He's not particularly mean or particularly obstinate and judging from his own dress and

1564
01:28:44.70 --> 01:28:46.58
leaning it attitude towards that of his troops.

1565
01:28:46.58 --> 01:28:49.74
He did not harbor any compulsive urge for a bull.

1566
01:28:49.74 --> 01:28:54.66
In this, as in other matters, his approach was essentially realistic.

1567
01:28:54.66 --> 01:29:00.02
Seems that whatever else he may be, Montgomery does not advance a well-documented signs

1568
01:29:00.02 --> 01:29:01.74
of authoritarianism.

1569
01:29:01.74 --> 01:29:05.38
And yet, even in this case, there remains the undisputable fact that for all his greatness

1570
01:29:05.38 --> 01:29:10.86
as a military commander, Montgomery did have serious shortcomings which could not be attributed

1571
01:29:10.86 --> 01:29:13.46
to a lack of professional ability.

1572
01:29:13.46 --> 01:29:17.26
So Montgomery did some jack-up things, and we covered it in one of the earlier podcasts.

1573
01:29:17.26 --> 01:29:23.14
We also covered it on a podcast, not about this book.

1574
01:29:23.14 --> 01:29:29.02
These lapses were an inability to get along with many of his military colleagues.

1575
01:29:29.02 --> 01:29:33.42
Like Kitchener, he had a knack of making himself enormously unpopular with his contemporaries

1576
01:29:33.42 --> 01:29:35.90
and preferred the company of younger and more junior officers.

1577
01:29:35.90 --> 01:29:39.18
It was a bad sign of talking about this on the Academy of the other day.

1578
01:29:39.18 --> 01:29:41.38
Extremeownership.com.

1579
01:29:41.38 --> 01:29:43.26
Somebody who's talking about it can't get along.

1580
01:29:43.26 --> 01:29:45.58
If you're not getting along with people, you're doing a bad job.

1581
01:29:45.58 --> 01:29:47.22
But what's wrong with you?

1582
01:29:47.22 --> 01:29:49.26
Aren't you getting along with people?

1583
01:29:49.26 --> 01:29:50.86
You should be getting along with people.

1584
01:29:50.86 --> 01:29:51.86
It was part of your job.

1585
01:29:51.86 --> 01:29:52.86
Build relationships.

1586
01:29:52.86 --> 01:29:55.14
What's happening with you?

1587
01:29:55.14 --> 01:30:00.10
Montgomery's second shortcoming was that he sometimes allowed his own desire for personal

1588
01:30:00.10 --> 01:30:04.46
glory to influence planning, a military plan tainted by an attempt to satisfy the commander's

1589
01:30:04.46 --> 01:30:09.02
ego is unlikely to be the best plan, and irrelevant factor has been introduced into the

1590
01:30:09.02 --> 01:30:10.02
calculation.

1591
01:30:10.02 --> 01:30:12.18
Clearly, that's jacked up.

1592
01:30:12.18 --> 01:30:15.58
Montgomery's next shortcoming presents something of a paradox, a concerns, a matter

1593
01:30:15.58 --> 01:30:16.58
of communication.

1594
01:30:16.58 --> 01:30:21.82
From man who is a depth that simplifying the apparently complex, whose ability to extract

1595
01:30:21.82 --> 01:30:27.46
the essentials from a host of irrelevant factors was second to none, who could communicate

1596
01:30:27.46 --> 01:30:31.46
his intentions and issue orders to his subordinates with the lucidity that left no room for

1597
01:30:31.46 --> 01:30:36.30
misinterpretation, and who could write his memoirs with such a style that puts most generals

1598
01:30:36.30 --> 01:30:37.30
to shame.

1599
01:30:37.30 --> 01:30:41.98
It is extraordinary that he should have been almost incapable of explaining himself to those

1600
01:30:41.98 --> 01:30:42.78
above him in the J.D.

1601
01:30:42.78 --> 01:30:43.78
Command.

1602
01:30:43.78 --> 01:30:44.78
Kind of crazy.

1603
01:30:44.78 --> 01:30:50.42
Got a whole big explanation on Montgomery and who wears some of that stuff came from

1604
01:30:50.42 --> 01:30:53.38
fast forward a little bit to Kitchener Kitchener who became Secretary of State in the

1605
01:30:53.38 --> 01:30:59.30
First World War had, according to Philip Magnus, two basic attributes and unparalleled

1606
01:30:59.30 --> 01:31:02.22
thoroughness and an unparalleled drive.

1607
01:31:02.22 --> 01:31:06.98
He was an individual, individualist of great conceptions, whose hard and selfless nature

1608
01:31:06.98 --> 01:31:10.54
was capable at times of kindness, sympathy, and even affection.

1609
01:31:10.54 --> 01:31:16.26
His traits, his excessive drive, Lord Curson, once described Kitchener as this molten

1610
01:31:16.26 --> 01:31:21.94
massive devouring energy, his individualism, and his refusal to conform the originality

1611
01:31:21.94 --> 01:31:26.34
of his thinking and the occasional flashes of underlying warmth and generosity are hard

1612
01:31:26.34 --> 01:31:29.18
to reconcile with the notion of authoritarianism.

1613
01:31:29.18 --> 01:31:36.34
So he's got Montgomery who has some authoritarianism, Kitchener is a little bit more authoritarianism

1614
01:31:36.34 --> 01:31:41.94
and as we push through his authoritarianism from Kitchener for all his greatness, Kitchener

1615
01:31:41.94 --> 01:31:46.54
seems to have been a victim of the repressive forces in place in him as a child, presumably

1616
01:31:46.54 --> 01:31:48.10
as a marionette of his father.

1617
01:31:48.10 --> 01:31:53.98
Then psychoanalytics going on, but what were those traits, regardless of where they came from,

1618
01:31:53.98 --> 01:31:58.18
his elufness, his unpopularism, many of his fellow officers, his failure to work as part

1619
01:31:58.18 --> 01:31:59.18
of a team.

1620
01:31:59.18 --> 01:32:03.74
And most damaging of all is latter-day indecisiveness and hesitancy in directing, collipally,

1621
01:32:03.74 --> 01:32:07.90
and pain must be ascribed to defects of the personality rather than intellect.

1622
01:32:07.90 --> 01:32:12.92
And again, it's just interesting to point out that authoritarianism, you'd think that

1623
01:32:12.92 --> 01:32:18.22
makes people make calls, but it actually freaks them out in these pressures that you

1624
01:32:18.22 --> 01:32:22.44
waste because they don't want to get, they don't, they don't, they don't handle failure

1625
01:32:22.44 --> 01:32:25.18
that don't know what to do and they just, they don't want to do anything.

1626
01:32:25.18 --> 01:32:27.98
Run to, run to, run, go off!

1627
01:32:27.98 --> 01:32:29.46
Where's somebody that's a little less authoritarian?

1628
01:32:29.46 --> 01:32:31.50
So like, okay, you know what, we've got to make a call here.

1629
01:32:31.50 --> 01:32:32.50
That's what we're doing.

1630
01:32:32.50 --> 01:32:39.26
Now, we get to Hague, and trying to answer the question whether the recurring features

1631
01:32:39.26 --> 01:32:43.18
of military incompetence derived from aspects of the authoritarian personality even in

1632
01:32:43.18 --> 01:32:45.74
a commander who ultimately emerged victorious.

1633
01:32:45.74 --> 01:32:49.46
One cannot do better than consider the case of Douglas Hague, Commander-in-Chief of the

1634
01:32:49.46 --> 01:32:54.42
British armies on the Western Front between 1915 and 1918.

1635
01:32:54.42 --> 01:32:58.70
Dudging from the war of words, which has raged between his detractors and devotees, there

1636
01:32:58.70 --> 01:33:00.90
was never a more controversial military commander.

1637
01:33:00.90 --> 01:33:07.34
Here's some quotes, Hague, Britain's number one war criminal, expected Germans to advance

1638
01:33:07.34 --> 01:33:12.78
in this attack and at the same time slow, at the same slow pace of his own clumsily planned

1639
01:33:12.78 --> 01:33:13.78
results.

1640
01:33:13.78 --> 01:33:17.46
Another quote, he seemed to be most highly equipped thinker in the British army.

1641
01:33:17.46 --> 01:33:19.66
That's totally different quote.

1642
01:33:19.66 --> 01:33:23.90
Another quote, Hague perhaps failed to see that a dead man cannot advance and that to

1643
01:33:23.90 --> 01:33:26.22
replace him is only to provide another corpse.

1644
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:30.94
Here's another quote, it is indeed strange that the man who stubbornness in the offensive

1645
01:33:30.94 --> 01:33:37.22
had all but ruined us on the Psalm should from August 1918 onwards have become the driving

1646
01:33:37.22 --> 01:33:39.22
force of the Allied armies.

1647
01:33:39.22 --> 01:33:40.22
That is crazy.

1648
01:33:40.22 --> 01:33:42.70
You freaking conduct this horrible operation.

1649
01:33:42.70 --> 01:33:47.34
So many people die and you just continue being in charge and directing operations.

1650
01:33:47.34 --> 01:33:52.70
Hague was unimaginative, maybe he was competent according to his lights, but these were

1651
01:33:52.70 --> 01:33:56.78
dim, confidence of divine approval appeared to satisfy him.

1652
01:33:56.78 --> 01:33:59.70
Nothing can excuse the casualties of the Psalm and passion dale.

1653
01:33:59.70 --> 01:34:05.66
World War I, freaking nightmare.

1654
01:34:05.66 --> 01:34:08.50
So what's up with his personality?

1655
01:34:08.50 --> 01:34:13.46
Did Hague evince those character traits that are associated with authoritarianism?

1656
01:34:13.46 --> 01:34:15.26
He certainly had most of them.

1657
01:34:15.26 --> 01:34:19.06
First start he was conservative, conventional and it is added to toward the French

1658
01:34:19.06 --> 01:34:26.26
Eiffnose centric, his diary and dispatch is suggest he was unemotional and totally anti-interceptive

1659
01:34:26.26 --> 01:34:30.30
IE not one to reflect upon his own motives.

1660
01:34:30.30 --> 01:34:34.34
He was manifestly lacking in compassion towards his fellow men.

1661
01:34:34.34 --> 01:34:38.42
It's just so important to hear these things, just to think, what do you think a military

1662
01:34:38.42 --> 01:34:43.54
commander should be like and what should a military commander actually be like?

1663
01:34:43.54 --> 01:34:49.02
He was a confirmed believer in the direction of events by supernatural powers and reserved

1664
01:34:49.02 --> 01:34:52.62
to the point of being verbally almost inarticulate.

1665
01:34:52.62 --> 01:34:58.78
Hague also betrayed that triad of traits which, according to contemporary research, defines

1666
01:34:58.78 --> 01:35:04.94
the obsessive character and correlated with authoritarianism.

1667
01:35:04.94 --> 01:35:09.30
He was obstinate, orderly and mean.

1668
01:35:09.30 --> 01:35:13.66
About his obstinacy, little further need to be said from the beginning to the end his handling

1669
01:35:13.66 --> 01:35:19.10
of the 30 braze, betoken and obscenancy of statuesque proportions.

1670
01:35:19.10 --> 01:35:21.14
His gallouge is stubborn, never changed his mind.

1671
01:35:21.14 --> 01:35:22.70
We're sticking with the plan.

1672
01:35:22.70 --> 01:35:26.86
For the second trait in his dress, habits and appearance, Hague was a maculate, orderly and

1673
01:35:26.86 --> 01:35:31.94
quite probably the cleanest man on the western front, a contemporary of his at Clifton,

1674
01:35:31.94 --> 01:35:36.10
remembered him particularly for his cleanliness, a remarkable attribute to be recalled

1675
01:35:36.10 --> 01:35:37.90
of a fellow schoolboy.

1676
01:35:37.90 --> 01:35:43.42
In the first, for an example of his love of bull, there's this excerpt from a cavalryman,

1677
01:35:43.42 --> 01:35:48.42
cavalryman's letter, quote, he had a personal escort consisting of a full troop of his own

1678
01:35:48.42 --> 01:35:49.82
regimen.

1679
01:35:49.82 --> 01:35:54.70
They were easily the smartest thing in France, not a buck a lot of place, stripes of gold for

1680
01:35:54.70 --> 01:36:01.34
the NCOs, silver, great silver skull and crossbones, and quote, other writers have commented

1681
01:36:01.34 --> 01:36:06.26
on his meticulous attention to my new detail and his habit of planning each day according

1682
01:36:06.26 --> 01:36:07.82
to a set pattern.

1683
01:36:07.82 --> 01:36:15.14
So there you go.

1684
01:36:15.14 --> 01:36:20.50
Any breaks out, basically, saying Montgomery, out of those three was the best and had the

1685
01:36:20.50 --> 01:36:26.66
least authoritarian nature, Kitchener, little bit more authoritarian, little bit worse performance

1686
01:36:26.66 --> 01:36:33.74
and then finally you get to Hague, total authoritarian attitude, and well, the worst,

1687
01:36:33.74 --> 01:36:36.94
example, and the worst leader.

1688
01:36:36.94 --> 01:36:45.30
And now we're getting to the final chapter of this book, Six Podcasts, Deep Spinos.

1689
01:36:45.30 --> 01:36:55.22
I went hard in the paint, retreat, this one's called, Hail, ye, indomitable heroes, hail,

1690
01:36:55.22 --> 01:36:58.18
despite all of your generals, ye prevailed.

1691
01:36:58.18 --> 01:37:03.06
That's from a land or who wrote a poem about the Crimean heroes and I just was talking

1692
01:37:03.06 --> 01:37:04.90
about this, right?

1693
01:37:04.90 --> 01:37:16.02
The Brits want, the Brits and their allies beat the Russian, despite their shitty leadership.

1694
01:37:16.02 --> 01:37:21.06
Classwits, this does difficulty in seeing things correctly, which is one of the greatest

1695
01:37:21.06 --> 01:37:27.06
sources of friction and war makes things appear quite different from what was expected.

1696
01:37:27.06 --> 01:37:29.54
Good job, classmates.

1697
01:37:29.54 --> 01:37:32.82
You know what you better learn how to do if you want to see things correctly, you better

1698
01:37:32.82 --> 01:37:36.78
learn to detach, you better learn to take a step back, you better learn to put your ego

1699
01:37:36.78 --> 01:37:39.86
and check, you better learn to get control over your emotions, so you're not seeing through

1700
01:37:39.86 --> 01:37:45.78
an e-gatistical or emotional lens.

1701
01:37:45.78 --> 01:37:51.14
It is not the intention to leave a comparable impression of general ship, but rather to

1702
01:37:51.14 --> 01:37:59.06
show that the nature of interspicy, that the nature of interspicy's aggression predisposes

1703
01:37:59.06 --> 01:38:04.66
the leaders of armies and navies to certain sorts of error.

1704
01:38:04.66 --> 01:38:08.46
So you're saying, look, when you start fighting and killing each other, it leads to certain

1705
01:38:08.46 --> 01:38:12.26
types of error, just in its own right.

1706
01:38:12.26 --> 01:38:18.58
Then he says, from far from diminishing the stature of senior military commanders, the existence

1707
01:38:18.58 --> 01:38:25.18
of this predisposition makes the performance of the majority of soldiers and sailors doubly

1708
01:38:25.18 --> 01:38:26.66
credible.

1709
01:38:26.66 --> 01:38:33.66
So there's so much natural disaster about to happen that when someone does a good job,

1710
01:38:33.66 --> 01:38:37.34
you should get double credit, two gold stars.

1711
01:38:37.34 --> 01:38:43.66
For being able to pull it off, when there's all this natural gravity towards chaos, may

1712
01:38:43.66 --> 01:38:49.90
have destruction, ego, authoritarian personalities, all that stuff is going on and yet some

1713
01:38:49.90 --> 01:38:55.70
people's most military people from the bottom to the top do a good job and overcome

1714
01:38:55.70 --> 01:38:56.70
that.

1715
01:38:56.70 --> 01:39:00.70
So you should get double the credit.

1716
01:39:00.70 --> 01:39:02.98
And this is all kind of a conclusion here.

1717
01:39:02.98 --> 01:39:07.78
The theory advanced in this book starts from the position that by its very nature, military

1718
01:39:07.78 --> 01:39:10.82
incompetence cannot be attributed to the dullness of intellect.

1719
01:39:10.82 --> 01:39:12.14
We've hammered that point home.

1720
01:39:12.14 --> 01:39:13.14
There is.

1721
01:39:13.14 --> 01:39:16.70
It seems a reoccurring pattern to military messaps, which defies any explanation in terms

1722
01:39:16.70 --> 01:39:17.70
of the bloody full theory.

1723
01:39:17.70 --> 01:39:20.70
So these people aren't stupid.

1724
01:39:20.70 --> 01:39:27.02
It is, and instead is tentatively suggested that the syndrome occurs through the enormous

1725
01:39:27.02 --> 01:39:33.18
difficulties of professionalizing the instinctual activity of interest species aggression.

1726
01:39:33.18 --> 01:39:41.26
This professionalism entails the growth of militarism, that collection of rules and conventions

1727
01:39:41.26 --> 01:39:45.22
whereby hostility is controlled and anxiety reduced.

1728
01:39:45.22 --> 01:39:53.46
So you've got this system set up to put command in place to reduce anxiety to overcome

1729
01:39:53.46 --> 01:39:55.22
some natural instincts.

1730
01:39:55.22 --> 01:39:58.30
That's what the military set up to do.

1731
01:39:58.30 --> 01:40:04.14
Not surprisingly, a military career attracts a minority of people with these sort of anxieties

1732
01:40:04.14 --> 01:40:06.14
within a military organization.

1733
01:40:06.14 --> 01:40:07.78
Their neurotic needs are gratified.

1734
01:40:07.78 --> 01:40:12.46
They, for their part, help to reinforce those very aspects of militarism, which are so

1735
01:40:12.46 --> 01:40:17.82
congealed to their requirements in return as it were for fitting in so well.

1736
01:40:17.82 --> 01:40:23.34
They may rise to positions of considerable power once they become incapacitated by the very

1737
01:40:23.34 --> 01:40:26.34
characteristics, which hasten to their assent.

1738
01:40:26.34 --> 01:40:28.74
You come in, you're authoritarian, you love it.

1739
01:40:28.74 --> 01:40:32.70
You come in because you're authoritarian and you want to fit into that, then you get in there

1740
01:40:32.70 --> 01:40:37.42
and you're gratified because that in your advance because you're authoritarian.

1741
01:40:37.42 --> 01:40:41.86
And if you make it all the way up, the chain of command, the very authoritarian traits

1742
01:40:41.86 --> 01:40:45.14
that you have are actually a disaster.

1743
01:40:45.14 --> 01:40:48.50
So this is a horrible thing.

1744
01:40:48.50 --> 01:40:52.70
And it took me six podcasts to get that out.

1745
01:40:52.70 --> 01:40:55.58
So much for a theory based on past history.

1746
01:40:55.58 --> 01:40:59.66
Has it, and he kind of goes, okay, look, I've showed you all these examples, which this book,

1747
01:40:59.66 --> 01:41:02.98
450 pages of this book is examples.

1748
01:41:02.98 --> 01:41:06.18
But he says so much for this theory based on a past history.

1749
01:41:06.18 --> 01:41:07.86
Has it any relevance for the future?

1750
01:41:07.86 --> 01:41:14.38
Since armies and navies have changed out of all recognition, perhaps the sorts of military

1751
01:41:14.38 --> 01:41:19.78
incompetence described in these pages are no longer likely to occur.

1752
01:41:19.78 --> 01:41:23.22
In fact, the evidence suggests this to be a foreloin hope.

1753
01:41:23.22 --> 01:41:25.18
So this shit still happens.

1754
01:41:25.18 --> 01:41:30.46
Some of the same sorts of mistakes occur now as blighted the lives of soldiers 100 years

1755
01:41:30.46 --> 01:41:31.46
ago.

1756
01:41:31.46 --> 01:41:37.02
In Vietnam, in three weeks, in 1968, the Ted offense of a lone cost of the Americans 500

1757
01:41:37.02 --> 01:41:42.38
dead in the South Vietnamese, 165,000 dead with 2 million refugees.

1758
01:41:42.38 --> 01:41:43.70
Why did it happen?

1759
01:41:43.70 --> 01:41:50.14
One reason was the inability to respond to unexpected military intelligence.

1760
01:41:50.14 --> 01:41:51.06
Fast forward a little bit.

1761
01:41:51.06 --> 01:41:55.50
Any doubts as to whether the three factors of remote control.

1762
01:41:55.50 --> 01:41:59.82
He goes into a thing explaining how some of the changes that have taken place.

1763
01:41:59.82 --> 01:42:01.74
One of them is remote control meaning we're now radios.

1764
01:42:01.74 --> 01:42:03.78
We can micromanage people out on the battlefield.

1765
01:42:03.78 --> 01:42:08.86
We make these big swollen staffs and all kinds of weaponry.

1766
01:42:08.86 --> 01:42:10.30
Has this helped?

1767
01:42:10.30 --> 01:42:12.06
Now do we have multiple people on a staff?

1768
01:42:12.06 --> 01:42:15.18
Maybe they can help sort through some of these people that are incompetent.

1769
01:42:15.18 --> 01:42:18.50
Or we have the power to see what's happening on the battlefield.

1770
01:42:18.50 --> 01:42:22.22
Maybe we can make adjustments through remote control.

1771
01:42:22.22 --> 01:42:23.86
We've got all these resources and weapons.

1772
01:42:23.86 --> 01:42:24.86
Maybe that helps.

1773
01:42:24.86 --> 01:42:25.86
So here's what he said.

1774
01:42:25.86 --> 01:42:26.86
It doesn't help.

1775
01:42:26.86 --> 01:42:29.82
He says any doubts to whether these three factors for remote control, swollen staffs and

1776
01:42:29.82 --> 01:42:34.86
the wealth of resources made for incompetence are removed by the contemplation of Vietnam.

1777
01:42:34.86 --> 01:42:39.50
In this most ill-conceived and horrible of wars, there was the commander in chief, Lyndon

1778
01:42:39.50 --> 01:42:46.14
Johnson, aided by his advisors, dreaming of policies and even selecting targets at a nice

1779
01:42:46.14 --> 01:42:49.26
safe distance of 12,000 miles.

1780
01:42:49.26 --> 01:42:55.78
And there was the man on the spot, General West Moreland, a by no means unintelligent military

1781
01:42:55.78 --> 01:43:01.10
commander, but be muzed by the sheer weight of destructive energy and aggressive notion

1782
01:43:01.10 --> 01:43:03.78
supplied by his president.

1783
01:43:03.78 --> 01:43:09.30
Together the Maca-Villian mind of the one coupled with the traditional military mind

1784
01:43:09.30 --> 01:43:13.02
of the other produced a pattern of martial lunacy.

1785
01:43:13.02 --> 01:43:18.54
So abject and appalling that it eventually did for both of them.

1786
01:43:18.54 --> 01:43:23.58
Like the Boor leaders, a half-century earlier, earlier, the versatile General G-Op, this

1787
01:43:23.58 --> 01:43:28.30
is the Vietnamese, North Vietnamese commander and his commander in chief, a little old man

1788
01:43:28.30 --> 01:43:29.86
with a wispy beard.

1789
01:43:29.86 --> 01:43:34.62
Ho Chi Minh made a huge professionally trained and over-equipped army of their enemies

1790
01:43:34.62 --> 01:43:37.50
look utterly ridiculous and their leaders helplessly.

1791
01:43:37.50 --> 01:43:42.66
I rate unfettered by traditional militarism, lacking in excessive brute force and without

1792
01:43:42.66 --> 01:43:50.14
an obsession with capturing real estate, whole and job relied on poor men's strategy.

1793
01:43:50.14 --> 01:43:54.66
Surprise deception and the ability to melt away, they relied on the fact that West Moreland

1794
01:43:54.66 --> 01:44:00.38
would expand, expand his energies, swatting wherever they had last been heard of while they

1795
01:44:00.38 --> 01:44:07.74
got ready to sting in somewhere else.

1796
01:44:07.74 --> 01:44:12.90
Yeah, and it's one of the most fascinating thing, and when we covered General Mouse,

1797
01:44:12.90 --> 01:44:18.18
like little red book, one thing that's so fascinating about this is what the communists

1798
01:44:18.18 --> 01:44:23.78
do to win wars is utilize decentralized command and they do it great and then for the way

1799
01:44:23.78 --> 01:44:27.22
they run their government, they decide to make it a foritary and in centralized, which

1800
01:44:27.22 --> 01:44:34.10
is crazy, which is crazy, and that's exactly what that spells out right there.

1801
01:44:34.10 --> 01:44:39.66
When we're in battle, decentralized command make things happen, small units out there acting

1802
01:44:39.66 --> 01:44:43.10
independently with freedom, and then for the government, guess what, we're locking

1803
01:44:43.10 --> 01:44:48.86
it all down, you're going to obey obey obey.

1804
01:44:48.86 --> 01:44:54.38
This brings up yet another hazard of modern war, government by committee.

1805
01:44:54.38 --> 01:44:58.82
Take the decision to invade Cuba with a group of crew, Cuban excitals, Bay of Pigs, and

1806
01:44:58.82 --> 01:45:02.98
approving the CIA plan Kennedy and his advisors made six assumptions each was wrong.

1807
01:45:02.98 --> 01:45:06.78
They assumed that no one would guess the US government was responsible for the invasion,

1808
01:45:06.78 --> 01:45:10.42
and they're contempt for the Cuban Air Force, they assumed it would be annihilated before

1809
01:45:10.42 --> 01:45:11.78
the invasion began.

1810
01:45:11.78 --> 01:45:16.26
They assumed that the small invasion force led by unpopular ex-offices from the best

1811
01:45:16.26 --> 01:45:21.46
teaser regime would be more than a match for Castro's quote, week army of 20,000 well-cooked

1812
01:45:21.46 --> 01:45:26.22
Cuban troops, they assumed that the invasion would touch off a general revolt behind Castro's

1813
01:45:26.22 --> 01:45:31.34
line, they assumed that even if unsuccessful in their primary objective, the ex-IL forces,

1814
01:45:31.34 --> 01:45:38.14
the ex-IL force could hold up in Cuban reinforced anti-Castro guerrillas.

1815
01:45:38.14 --> 01:45:42.10
What's their plan? Do assumption, assumption, assumption, assumption, and the event that

1816
01:45:42.10 --> 01:45:47.70
each assumption proved a gross, in the event, each assumption proved a gross miscalculation.

1817
01:45:47.70 --> 01:45:48.70
Nothing went as planned.

1818
01:45:48.70 --> 01:45:53.30
Nobody believed the CIA covered story that ships carrying reserve ammunition for the invasion

1819
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:54.70
force failed to arrive.

1820
01:45:54.70 --> 01:45:59.10
Two were sunk in two fled by the second day, and the invaders were surrounded by Castro's

1821
01:45:59.10 --> 01:46:01.82
army and by the third day they were either dead or behind bars.

1822
01:46:01.82 --> 01:46:04.74
Seven months later, the United States recovered what was left of their invasion force

1823
01:46:04.74 --> 01:46:10.74
for a ransom price to Castro of $53 million, Kennedy was stricken.

1824
01:46:10.74 --> 01:46:15.22
How could I have been so stupid as to let them go ahead he asked?

1825
01:46:15.22 --> 01:46:19.66
As Sornson wrote, his anguish was doubly deepened by the knowledge that the rest of the

1826
01:46:19.66 --> 01:46:21.86
world was asking the same question.

1827
01:46:21.86 --> 01:46:27.14
Arthur Slesinger, Jr., noted that Kennedy would sometimes refer incredulously to the Bay

1828
01:46:27.14 --> 01:46:32.98
of Pigs, wondering how irrational and responsible government could have big common involved

1829
01:46:32.98 --> 01:46:39.66
in so an ill-start adventure.

1830
01:46:39.66 --> 01:46:44.22
Sonded is 77, 7, 1941 had been set aside by Admiral Kimmel Commander Chief of the

1831
01:46:44.22 --> 01:46:50.86
Pacific Fleet for a friendly game of golf with his colleague General Short.

1832
01:46:50.86 --> 01:46:56.30
96 of his ships, the American Fleet slept at anchor in the harbor American plane, stood

1833
01:46:56.30 --> 01:47:01.06
a wing-tipped wing-tipped on the tarmac, American servicemen were off duty and doing weekend

1834
01:47:01.06 --> 01:47:05.62
leave by the end of the day, Pearl Harbor with the ships planes and military installations

1835
01:47:05.62 --> 01:47:09.90
had been reduced to smoking ruins, 2000 service men have been killed and many more wounded

1836
01:47:09.90 --> 01:47:11.62
are missing.

1837
01:47:11.62 --> 01:47:14.30
By the end of the day, Kimmel was offering to resign.

1838
01:47:14.30 --> 01:47:17.42
Later he was court-martialed, reprimanded and demoted to a position where he's never

1839
01:47:17.42 --> 01:47:20.06
again required to make decisions of any consequence.

1840
01:47:20.06 --> 01:47:24.58
Pearl Harbor, like the Bay of Pigs, confirmed once again that military incompetence is

1841
01:47:24.58 --> 01:47:33.22
more often a product of personality characteristics than of intellectual shortcomings.

1842
01:47:33.22 --> 01:47:40.78
For these American disasters show very clearly that even combined intellect and specialized

1843
01:47:40.78 --> 01:47:46.58
knowledge of highly intelligent and dedicated men are no proof against decision so totally

1844
01:47:46.58 --> 01:47:52.98
unrealistic and subsequently to tax the credually of even those who had made them.

1845
01:47:52.98 --> 01:48:00.74
Far from diminishing the chances of an aptitude, the group actually accentuates the effects

1846
01:48:00.74 --> 01:48:08.94
of those very traits which may lead to incompetence in individual commanders.

1847
01:48:08.94 --> 01:48:13.62
So you get a group together and you'd think that this would kind of cancel out and say,

1848
01:48:13.62 --> 01:48:15.30
hey, heck, I don't have that's a good idea.

1849
01:48:15.30 --> 01:48:16.66
No, it actually gets worse.

1850
01:48:16.66 --> 01:48:17.86
It turns into groupthink.

1851
01:48:17.86 --> 01:48:25.30
The symptoms of this process, which Janice terms groupthink include, one, and illusion of

1852
01:48:25.30 --> 01:48:30.82
invulnerability that becomes shared by most members of the group.

1853
01:48:30.82 --> 01:48:37.22
Two, collective attempts to ignore rationalize a way, items of information which might

1854
01:48:37.22 --> 01:48:41.70
otherwise leave the group to reconsider shaky but cherish assumptions.

1855
01:48:41.70 --> 01:48:47.82
Three, an unquestion belief in the groups inherent morality, busson-nabling members to overlook

1856
01:48:47.82 --> 01:48:51.86
ethical consequences of their decision.

1857
01:48:51.86 --> 01:48:57.26
Four, stereotyping the enemy as either too evil from negotiation or too stupid and

1858
01:48:57.26 --> 01:49:01.34
feeble to be a threat.

1859
01:49:01.34 --> 01:49:04.38
You can see, you can hear this happening in the room, right?

1860
01:49:04.38 --> 01:49:06.66
You can hear the discussions happening.

1861
01:49:06.66 --> 01:49:13.90
A shared illusion of unenemity in a majority viewpoint augmented by the false assumption

1862
01:49:13.90 --> 01:49:24.14
that silence means consent and six self-appointed mind guards to protect the group from adverse

1863
01:49:24.14 --> 01:49:33.86
information that might shatter complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions.

1864
01:49:33.86 --> 01:49:40.26
That's what happens when you put a bunch of people that have these tendencies into a group

1865
01:49:40.26 --> 01:49:45.50
together, it gets a worse.

1866
01:49:45.50 --> 01:49:49.02
This is the last thing I'm going to read from the book here.

1867
01:49:49.02 --> 01:49:56.46
Finally, it is worth noting that the personality determined malaise of groupthink produces

1868
01:49:56.46 --> 01:50:03.34
once again those four most frequently occurring symptoms of past military incompetence,

1869
01:50:03.34 --> 01:50:05.70
wastage of manpower.

1870
01:50:05.70 --> 01:50:16.02
Everconfidence under estimation of the enemy and ignoring of intelligence reports, these

1871
01:50:16.02 --> 01:50:26.46
it seems are the enduring hazards of professionalizing violence.

1872
01:50:26.46 --> 01:50:30.70
And I can tell you these are not only the hazards of professionalizing violence, these

1873
01:50:30.70 --> 01:50:39.78
are the enduring hazards for us as human beings, as leaders, that we can all fall into.

1874
01:50:39.78 --> 01:50:44.26
And as you pointed out, this book is a big warning of what not to do.

1875
01:50:44.26 --> 01:50:47.86
I got it, I said it was the last thing I'm going to read, but there's a, look, this guy's

1876
01:50:47.86 --> 01:50:51.82
funny and I did a bad job of relaying some of this humor.

1877
01:50:51.82 --> 01:50:54.30
Here's the after word of this book.

1878
01:50:54.30 --> 01:50:57.70
And then this is the last thing I'm going to read from this book after six podcasts.

1879
01:50:57.70 --> 01:51:02.34
He says, this is so British.

1880
01:51:02.34 --> 01:51:06.46
He says, let's the readers should have doubted my qualifications to write this book.

1881
01:51:06.46 --> 01:51:13.62
Let me assure him that I have marked authoritarian traits a week ago, fear of failure

1882
01:51:13.62 --> 01:51:20.10
motivation and no illusions about the fact that I would have made a grossly incompetent

1883
01:51:20.10 --> 01:51:21.98
general.

1884
01:51:21.98 --> 01:51:24.78
It takes one to no one.

1885
01:51:24.78 --> 01:51:26.50
That was from the author in 1935.

1886
01:51:26.50 --> 01:51:27.50
A little bit of humor.

1887
01:51:27.50 --> 01:51:32.14
And he says it takes one to no one.

1888
01:51:32.14 --> 01:51:34.14
But that's unfortunately not true.

1889
01:51:34.14 --> 01:51:37.74
It's unfortunately not true.

1890
01:51:37.74 --> 01:51:45.30
If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.

1891
01:51:45.30 --> 01:51:47.02
You can see where I'm going this.

1892
01:51:47.02 --> 01:51:50.90
If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.

1893
01:51:50.90 --> 01:51:54.70
Because if you think you're incompetent, you're actually humble and you're thinking, ooh,

1894
01:51:54.70 --> 01:52:00.38
I don't know if I need to listen to one of the people I have to say, I need to check myself.

1895
01:52:00.38 --> 01:52:03.26
I need to learn, I need to open my mind and see what other information I can grab

1896
01:52:03.26 --> 01:52:07.34
or because I've got to feel like I might be incompetent.

1897
01:52:07.34 --> 01:52:12.54
If you feel like it's kind of when people ask me about the imposter syndrome, what if

1898
01:52:12.54 --> 01:52:13.54
I'm impostering it?

1899
01:52:13.54 --> 01:52:14.54
Good.

1900
01:52:14.54 --> 01:52:16.98
That means you're actually thinking, man, do I even believe need to be?

1901
01:52:16.98 --> 01:52:17.98
I always had that.

1902
01:52:17.98 --> 01:52:21.70
I always felt like, oh man, if I'm going to need to be making decisions, I better do my

1903
01:52:21.70 --> 01:52:22.70
homework.

1904
01:52:22.70 --> 01:52:26.70
I better think this through a better pay attention.

1905
01:52:26.70 --> 01:52:30.78
So if you think you're incompetent, you probably aren't.

1906
01:52:30.78 --> 01:52:35.38
But if you've been listening to these six straight podcasts and you've been thinking

1907
01:52:35.38 --> 01:52:38.90
that this book is about all the incompetent leaders around you, that's the little warning

1908
01:52:38.90 --> 01:52:40.30
sign.

1909
01:52:40.30 --> 01:52:46.26
Be careful because if you are in that mindset where you think, man, I can't believe how

1910
01:52:46.26 --> 01:52:49.18
jacked up all these other leaders are.

1911
01:52:49.18 --> 01:52:58.06
So not you, red flag because chances are, this is about you.

1912
01:52:58.06 --> 01:53:00.42
And look, here's the other red flag.

1913
01:53:00.42 --> 01:53:01.74
It's a scale, right?

1914
01:53:01.74 --> 01:53:02.74
You brought that up.

1915
01:53:02.74 --> 01:53:06.06
It's a continuum.

1916
01:53:06.06 --> 01:53:12.50
And so we all of us, even if you feel like you're pretty competent, you are under threat

1917
01:53:12.50 --> 01:53:15.06
of being dragged to incompetency.

1918
01:53:15.06 --> 01:53:18.50
So all these little, this book is just a warning sign after a warning sign after a warning

1919
01:53:18.50 --> 01:53:22.26
sign and by the way, there's nothing new.

1920
01:53:22.26 --> 01:53:23.50
There's almost nothing new.

1921
01:53:23.50 --> 01:53:25.30
There's one thing that I said, that's a new thought to me.

1922
01:53:25.30 --> 01:53:26.66
I forget what it was.

1923
01:53:26.66 --> 01:53:32.06
But in these 400 pages and whatever we just did 12, 15 hours worth of podcasts, it's

1924
01:53:32.06 --> 01:53:33.78
all, it's a rehash.

1925
01:53:33.78 --> 01:53:37.66
It's a reinforcement of information that I already knew that we already knew that we

1926
01:53:37.66 --> 01:53:42.22
talk about all the time, that we've seen it a bunch of other situations.

1927
01:53:42.22 --> 01:53:43.94
It's a rehash.

1928
01:53:43.94 --> 01:53:51.14
But we're all getting, we can all get pulled, over there, we can get pulled towards

1929
01:53:51.14 --> 01:53:52.14
that authoritarian mindset.

1930
01:53:52.14 --> 01:53:54.74
Because, you know why we get pulled towards the authoritarian mindset?

1931
01:53:54.74 --> 01:53:59.06
We get pulled towards that authoritarian mindset because it seems easier.

1932
01:53:59.06 --> 01:54:01.70
It seems easier to say, shut up and do what I told you to do.

1933
01:54:01.70 --> 01:54:02.70
It seems easier to say, you know what?

1934
01:54:02.70 --> 01:54:05.34
I'm not going to listen to that piece of information.

1935
01:54:05.34 --> 01:54:07.58
It seems easier to do that.

1936
01:54:07.58 --> 01:54:10.78
It seems like the right move.

1937
01:54:10.78 --> 01:54:12.38
It seems easier to say, you know what?

1938
01:54:12.38 --> 01:54:15.34
The competitor's never going to be able to do what we're doing.

1939
01:54:15.34 --> 01:54:20.06
It seems easier and it's not.

1940
01:54:20.06 --> 01:54:21.06
So you got to get watched.

1941
01:54:21.06 --> 01:54:22.06
You got to watch out.

1942
01:54:22.06 --> 01:54:23.06
You got to pay attention.

1943
01:54:23.06 --> 01:54:24.06
You got to be careful.

1944
01:54:24.06 --> 01:54:26.50
We all have to be on guard in competence.

1945
01:54:26.50 --> 01:54:28.62
In competence is out there sort of ready to attach.

1946
01:54:28.62 --> 01:54:29.78
It's ready to attach.

1947
01:54:29.78 --> 01:54:30.78
Yes.

1948
01:54:30.78 --> 01:54:32.62
And if you're not on guard, it'll grab you.

1949
01:54:32.62 --> 01:54:36.02
It'll pull you down and you'll be making bad decisions and getting people killed or ruining

1950
01:54:36.02 --> 01:54:41.26
your business or ruining your marriage or ruining your life through incompetence.

1951
01:54:41.26 --> 01:54:43.26
So we have to pay attention.

1952
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:46.50
You got to be careful.

1953
01:54:46.50 --> 01:54:47.50
We got to stay on the path.

1954
01:54:47.50 --> 01:54:48.50
Yes.

1955
01:54:48.50 --> 01:54:49.50
The path.

1956
01:54:49.50 --> 01:54:52.94
Speaking of where it's, you know?

1957
01:54:52.94 --> 01:54:53.98
What do you got for us?

1958
01:54:53.98 --> 01:54:54.98
How do you advise?

1959
01:54:54.98 --> 01:54:56.98
We avoid incompetence.

1960
01:54:56.98 --> 01:54:57.98
We avoid incompetence.

1961
01:54:57.98 --> 01:54:58.98
Mental incompetence.

1962
01:54:58.98 --> 01:54:59.98
Leadership incompetence.

1963
01:54:59.98 --> 01:55:00.98
Physical incompetence.

1964
01:55:00.98 --> 01:55:01.98
Physical incompetence.

1965
01:55:01.98 --> 01:55:04.38
We don't want to have that.

1966
01:55:04.38 --> 01:55:05.38
What do you got for us?

1967
01:55:05.38 --> 01:55:06.38
Second trial.

1968
01:55:06.38 --> 01:55:12.30
Because the Dunning Kruger effect that you kind of referred to, where the, it takes one

1969
01:55:12.30 --> 01:55:15.70
to know on that's not necessarily true.

1970
01:55:15.70 --> 01:55:20.50
Yeah, that it feels like when you, you think you know everything.

1971
01:55:20.50 --> 01:55:24.30
It's like it's easy to know everything when you think there's only like three or four things

1972
01:55:24.30 --> 01:55:25.30
to know.

1973
01:55:25.30 --> 01:55:29.30
But then when you start due to it and you're like, man, once I know how to stop that

1974
01:55:29.30 --> 01:55:30.70
on lock, I'll be good.

1975
01:55:30.70 --> 01:55:31.70
Kind of be it.

1976
01:55:31.70 --> 01:55:32.70
Yeah.

1977
01:55:32.70 --> 01:55:33.70
Because you got on lock three times.

1978
01:55:33.70 --> 01:55:34.70
Yeah.

1979
01:55:34.70 --> 01:55:37.62
You're in a random, you know, blue belt, you're like, oh, dude, I'm gonna stop that.

1980
01:55:37.62 --> 01:55:39.22
And then you get your toe figured it out.

1981
01:55:39.22 --> 01:55:40.42
And you feel like I'm not gonna stop the choke.

1982
01:55:40.42 --> 01:55:41.42
Then you know, heel hook.

1983
01:55:41.42 --> 01:55:42.42
Yeah, I do.

1984
01:55:42.42 --> 01:55:43.42
I'm not gonna stop that heel hook.

1985
01:55:43.42 --> 01:55:44.42
Yeah, just goes on.

1986
01:55:44.42 --> 01:55:45.42
Yeah.

1987
01:55:45.42 --> 01:55:49.10
Yeah, so the guy who actually does stop after like you get heel hooked, armedlocked, a

1988
01:55:49.10 --> 01:55:51.26
zeeke heel choked, freaking.

1989
01:55:51.26 --> 01:55:52.54
Then you go, oh, there's a lot more.

1990
01:55:52.54 --> 01:55:53.54
I don't know what I'm doing.

1991
01:55:53.54 --> 01:55:54.54
Yes.

1992
01:55:54.54 --> 01:55:56.66
So it's a minute to convince you of that.

1993
01:55:56.66 --> 01:55:57.66
Yeah.

1994
01:55:57.66 --> 01:56:02.02
So that's when you kind of, when the, it's all the Dunning Kruger effect.

1995
01:56:02.02 --> 01:56:06.22
It's essentially like, yeah, when you think you people who are like so confident, they're

1996
01:56:06.22 --> 01:56:09.42
the ones that know less than the people who are like not confident at all because they know

1997
01:56:09.42 --> 01:56:10.74
how much there is not to know.

1998
01:56:10.74 --> 01:56:12.74
You know, they have a grasp on it or whatever.

1999
01:56:12.74 --> 01:56:14.98
Yeah, Dave, good deal, Dave.

2000
01:56:14.98 --> 01:56:15.98
Said something.

2001
01:56:15.98 --> 01:56:18.94
I forget his exact words, but I wish I remembered it.

2002
01:56:18.94 --> 01:56:22.14
It was something like, oh, yeah, when he's talking about you, you're just a, he was like,

2003
01:56:22.14 --> 01:56:26.50
um, yeah, it's almost like you get, you learn what he said.

2004
01:56:26.50 --> 01:56:28.78
It's almost like you get worse over time.

2005
01:56:28.78 --> 01:56:31.50
Because yesterday there was only three things I didn't know.

2006
01:56:31.50 --> 01:56:33.86
Like now there's like 40 things that don't know.

2007
01:56:33.86 --> 01:56:34.86
I don't know.

2008
01:56:34.86 --> 01:56:35.86
There's a thousand.

2009
01:56:35.86 --> 01:56:36.86
Yeah.

2010
01:56:36.86 --> 01:56:40.14
With a day that you start to look, start to feel okay as when you go, oh, there's

2011
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:41.14
an infinite number of things.

2012
01:56:41.14 --> 01:56:42.14
Yeah.

2013
01:56:42.14 --> 01:56:43.14
I just don't know anything.

2014
01:56:43.14 --> 01:56:44.14
Yeah.

2015
01:56:44.14 --> 01:56:45.14
Take a look.

2016
01:56:45.14 --> 01:56:47.58
Well, so we want to know stuff.

2017
01:56:47.58 --> 01:56:49.58
Hey, complacency, right?

2018
01:56:49.58 --> 01:56:50.58
complacency.

2019
01:56:50.58 --> 01:56:51.58
That's one of the deals.

2020
01:56:51.58 --> 01:57:00.78
It's like your whole brain and body, but brain, trying to, trying to like be lazy for

2021
01:57:00.78 --> 01:57:05.14
lack of a better term, like I said before, trying to save energy, trying to save work,

2022
01:57:05.14 --> 01:57:07.74
like when you do more work or less work.

2023
01:57:07.74 --> 01:57:08.74
Yep.

2024
01:57:08.74 --> 01:57:10.74
She was saying it's like a Rubik's cube.

2025
01:57:10.74 --> 01:57:12.86
You're, are you good at Rubik's cube?

2026
01:57:12.86 --> 01:57:13.86
Yeah.

2027
01:57:13.86 --> 01:57:14.86
You are.

2028
01:57:14.86 --> 01:57:15.86
Yeah, you know the formula.

2029
01:57:15.86 --> 01:57:19.30
Yep, I know all the algorithms to get the sides, termed up, right?

2030
01:57:19.30 --> 01:57:20.30
This good.

2031
01:57:20.30 --> 01:57:21.30
Well, let's say you didn't.

2032
01:57:21.30 --> 01:57:23.34
Well, actually, not just kid riding on your room.

2033
01:57:23.34 --> 01:57:28.42
That kind of surprised me when I was like, damn, all right.

2034
01:57:28.42 --> 01:57:30.10
That's like if you say new how to play the piano.

2035
01:57:30.10 --> 01:57:31.10
But it is an algorithm.

2036
01:57:31.10 --> 01:57:32.10
Yeah, yeah.

2037
01:57:32.10 --> 01:57:33.10
Yeah, yeah.

2038
01:57:33.10 --> 01:57:34.10
Yeah, yeah.

2039
01:57:34.10 --> 01:57:35.10
It's like a little like a literature.

2040
01:57:35.10 --> 01:57:36.10
A little steps.

2041
01:57:36.10 --> 01:57:37.10
Yes, yes, exactly right.

2042
01:57:37.10 --> 01:57:39.90
Like yeah, it's a little formula for sure.

2043
01:57:39.90 --> 01:57:43.90
But whether you know the formula or not, I would imagine that, let's say you got that

2044
01:57:43.90 --> 01:57:44.90
thing figured out.

2045
01:57:44.90 --> 01:57:45.90
Right.

2046
01:57:45.90 --> 01:57:51.30
But then on one side, you got that one freaking different color on the side.

2047
01:57:51.30 --> 01:57:53.98
Just the one, you know that's not just one move.

2048
01:57:53.98 --> 01:57:57.02
That's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,

2049
01:57:57.02 --> 01:57:59.02
you know, there's like, oh, you know the formula.

2050
01:57:59.02 --> 01:58:02.26
It was like 13 moves, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

2051
01:58:02.26 --> 01:58:03.78
left left up to two, two, five.

2052
01:58:03.78 --> 01:58:06.86
But it would imagine it would be like multiples of four for some reason.

2053
01:58:06.86 --> 01:58:08.98
I don't know why I think that could be right.

2054
01:58:08.98 --> 01:58:09.98
Could be wrong.

2055
01:58:09.98 --> 01:58:10.98
There's the deal.

2056
01:58:10.98 --> 01:58:11.98
Let me ask you this.

2057
01:58:11.98 --> 01:58:15.90
What, you know, I was the kid and when we were, we just creeped came out.

2058
01:58:15.90 --> 01:58:19.82
It took me like no less than, you know, 15 minutes to figure out how to break that thing

2059
01:58:19.82 --> 01:58:20.82
apart.

2060
01:58:20.82 --> 01:58:21.82
Oh, yeah, assemble it in the correct order.

2061
01:58:21.82 --> 01:58:22.82
Yeah.

2062
01:58:22.82 --> 01:58:25.74
And then actually, that's smart to do in a couple of, yeah.

2063
01:58:25.74 --> 01:58:26.74
It's creative.

2064
01:58:26.74 --> 01:58:27.74
Put it this way.

2065
01:58:27.74 --> 01:58:28.74
Yeah, that's the thing.

2066
01:58:28.74 --> 01:58:31.70
This might, I'm not saying you were creative because I don't know.

2067
01:58:31.70 --> 01:58:34.22
But you seem like the type, you didn't do it out of creativity.

2068
01:58:34.22 --> 01:58:38.74
You did it just out of like brute-fucking jacco.

2069
01:58:38.74 --> 01:58:39.98
Yes.

2070
01:58:39.98 --> 01:58:41.70
But when you break it, that's not the night.

2071
01:58:41.70 --> 01:58:42.98
I just broke jacco.

2072
01:58:42.98 --> 01:58:45.98
It's just like, hey, yeah, I'm going to solve this problem.

2073
01:58:45.98 --> 01:58:47.58
It's direct way I can.

2074
01:58:47.58 --> 01:58:51.54
But if you look at those rules, you take it all apart.

2075
01:58:51.54 --> 01:58:55.98
It the last pieces, those center pieces, kind of tell a little bit of a story.

2076
01:58:55.98 --> 01:58:56.98
Yeah.

2077
01:58:56.98 --> 01:58:58.38
You can, they're stuck there.

2078
01:58:58.38 --> 01:59:00.06
But no, I think you take them out.

2079
01:59:00.06 --> 01:59:02.18
You could pop off like this little star thing.

2080
01:59:02.18 --> 01:59:03.46
Yeah, yeah, it would make less sense.

2081
01:59:03.46 --> 01:59:04.46
Exactly.

2082
01:59:04.46 --> 01:59:05.46
That's what I'm saying.

2083
01:59:05.46 --> 01:59:06.46
It tells a little story there.

2084
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:11.82
So you're like, oh, I see, then maybe, I don't know what you do to then put them back

2085
01:59:11.82 --> 01:59:12.82
together.

2086
01:59:12.82 --> 01:59:14.46
Here's another way to do it.

2087
01:59:14.46 --> 01:59:16.26
All the colors are little stickers.

2088
01:59:16.26 --> 01:59:17.26
Oh, God.

2089
01:59:17.26 --> 01:59:18.26
Yeah.

2090
01:59:18.26 --> 01:59:20.54
The last brute wave doing that a little bit more sophisticated.

2091
01:59:20.54 --> 01:59:21.54
It is.

2092
01:59:21.54 --> 01:59:22.54
I don't know.

2093
01:59:22.54 --> 01:59:24.74
So you got like glue all over your freaking hands.

2094
01:59:24.74 --> 01:59:26.34
I didn't say it was perfect to you.

2095
01:59:26.34 --> 01:59:27.90
And then say it was perfect.

2096
01:59:27.90 --> 01:59:29.70
Either way, that's the frustration.

2097
01:59:29.70 --> 01:59:30.70
You got it all figured out.

2098
01:59:30.70 --> 01:59:32.54
You're going to use it for like, in seconds.

2099
01:59:32.54 --> 01:59:33.54
Yeah, the way.

2100
01:59:33.54 --> 01:59:34.54
Oh, yeah.

2101
01:59:34.54 --> 01:59:35.94
You're going to use it for like a second.

2102
01:59:35.94 --> 01:59:36.94
So Rubius Cube is what?

2103
01:59:36.94 --> 01:59:38.38
It's nine on each side, right?

2104
01:59:38.38 --> 01:59:39.38
Right?

2105
01:59:39.38 --> 01:59:44.78
You're seeing those ones with like, freaking like 64 squares on each side or whatever.

2106
01:59:44.78 --> 01:59:45.78
I have not.

2107
01:59:45.78 --> 01:59:46.78
They're not.

2108
01:59:46.78 --> 01:59:47.78
And guys will do them too.

2109
01:59:47.78 --> 01:59:49.58
In like a time lapse or whatever.

2110
01:59:49.58 --> 01:59:51.94
Nonetheless, you see my point.

2111
01:59:51.94 --> 01:59:54.26
No, I have no idea what you think you got.

2112
01:59:54.26 --> 01:59:56.90
You think you got things figured out in life.

2113
01:59:56.90 --> 02:00:01.74
Then you get this one lone idea that kind of jams up your whole way of thinking.

2114
02:00:01.74 --> 02:00:03.54
Just that one.

2115
02:00:03.54 --> 02:00:08.46
It's way easier to take off that sticker or maybe just turn it to the side where you can't

2116
02:00:08.46 --> 02:00:09.46
see that thing.

2117
02:00:09.46 --> 02:00:10.46
It's way easier.

2118
02:00:10.46 --> 02:00:11.46
Okay.

2119
02:00:11.46 --> 02:00:13.82
Safe way, way more energy.

2120
02:00:13.82 --> 02:00:17.94
But the reality is the correct thing to do is, bro, you got to know that algorithm,

2121
02:00:17.94 --> 02:00:18.94
the formula.

2122
02:00:18.94 --> 02:00:21.14
It's going to take some steps and take some more work.

2123
02:00:21.14 --> 02:00:22.78
But at the end of the day, you're going to have a correct.

2124
02:00:22.78 --> 02:00:23.78
That's what I think.

2125
02:00:23.78 --> 02:00:24.78
Okay.

2126
02:00:24.78 --> 02:00:25.78
It's the 100% wrong.

2127
02:00:25.78 --> 02:00:27.78
And that's what you got to think in a way.

2128
02:00:27.78 --> 02:00:28.78
So amazing.

2129
02:00:28.78 --> 02:00:35.18
Like it's even your attitude right now is telling me that you might be feeling the effects

2130
02:00:35.18 --> 02:00:39.18
of the what he called, well, how'd you put it, like slipping off the path?

2131
02:00:39.18 --> 02:00:42.42
You know, my mind is so close to your freaking metaphors right now.

2132
02:00:42.42 --> 02:00:44.42
Let's ridiculous.

2133
02:00:44.42 --> 02:00:46.30
Anyway, we're working out.

2134
02:00:46.30 --> 02:00:47.30
It's squat season.

2135
02:00:47.30 --> 02:00:50.30
By the way, I heard my apparently it's squat season.

2136
02:00:50.30 --> 02:00:51.30
Back to squat.

2137
02:00:51.30 --> 02:00:52.30
That's the worst.

2138
02:00:52.30 --> 02:00:53.30
So we're on the path.

2139
02:00:53.30 --> 02:00:54.30
Stay in there.

2140
02:00:54.30 --> 02:00:58.10
The beginning of squat season, the beginning of any physical related season.

2141
02:00:58.10 --> 02:01:04.30
If there's any more in squat season, it's going to be painful, especially the beginning.

2142
02:01:04.30 --> 02:01:09.14
If you go snowboarding the first day of snowboarding season, that day you're going to have

2143
02:01:09.14 --> 02:01:10.14
dawn.

2144
02:01:10.14 --> 02:01:11.14
It should be sore.

2145
02:01:11.14 --> 02:01:12.14
It seems like anyway.

2146
02:01:12.14 --> 02:01:15.14
My point is you're going to need some supplementation here and there.

2147
02:01:15.14 --> 02:01:16.14
You know, it's no problem.

2148
02:01:16.14 --> 02:01:17.14
We got some for you.

2149
02:01:17.14 --> 02:01:18.14
Jocco has some for you.

2150
02:01:18.14 --> 02:01:19.14
Jocco feel.

2151
02:01:19.14 --> 02:01:20.14
That was a long wrap.

2152
02:01:20.14 --> 02:01:23.30
Let's start with the energy drinks.

2153
02:01:23.30 --> 02:01:25.34
See, this is not seasonal.

2154
02:01:25.34 --> 02:01:27.94
This is your own energy drink.

2155
02:01:27.94 --> 02:01:30.58
But not the tradition energy drink.

2156
02:01:30.58 --> 02:01:33.18
This is a healthy energy drink.

2157
02:01:33.18 --> 02:01:34.18
Energy health drink.

2158
02:01:34.18 --> 02:01:35.46
Whatever you want to call it.

2159
02:01:35.46 --> 02:01:36.46
All upside no downside.

2160
02:01:36.46 --> 02:01:37.46
All healthy for you.

2161
02:01:37.46 --> 02:01:40.42
You'll be healthier after you drink one or two.

2162
02:01:40.42 --> 02:01:41.42
Seems same.

2163
02:01:41.42 --> 02:01:51.18
By the way, there's a new pre workout powder formula, which JP to Mel did two dry

2164
02:01:51.18 --> 02:01:52.18
scoops.

2165
02:01:52.18 --> 02:01:56.06
And then the chaser of the sour apple sniper.

2166
02:01:56.06 --> 02:02:00.10
But I did, I was talking to my daughter today.

2167
02:02:00.10 --> 02:02:07.74
And she just did her first experience on the new powder, the new go powder.

2168
02:02:07.74 --> 02:02:10.82
And while I was talking to her, she was on the roller.

2169
02:02:10.82 --> 02:02:13.70
She didn't see to get net pole on poles.

2170
02:02:13.70 --> 02:02:14.70
Chain out.

2171
02:02:14.70 --> 02:02:16.62
Get that chain out, this her.

2172
02:02:16.62 --> 02:02:22.14
And she was saying as she in between breaths that I won't even have.

2173
02:02:22.14 --> 02:02:23.14
I wrote it in.

2174
02:02:23.14 --> 02:02:25.26
But I took the go.

2175
02:02:25.26 --> 02:02:28.06
It freaking hit.

2176
02:02:28.06 --> 02:02:29.06
And that is a real thing.

2177
02:02:29.06 --> 02:02:30.06
That's a real thing.

2178
02:02:30.06 --> 02:02:31.06
Yeah.

2179
02:02:31.06 --> 02:02:38.34
And I was an mention this before offline, where I'm no stranger to the jittery pre workout

2180
02:02:38.34 --> 02:02:39.34
powders.

2181
02:02:39.34 --> 02:02:42.06
I'm not scared of that kind of stuff.

2182
02:02:42.06 --> 02:02:45.34
And in fact, you get the jitteres or whatever all that stuff.

2183
02:02:45.34 --> 02:02:46.78
To me, that's no factor.

2184
02:02:46.78 --> 02:02:50.66
And in fact, when you're tired and the jitteres hit you, I'd rather have jitteres than

2185
02:02:50.66 --> 02:02:53.86
to be fired up to work out than not have jitteres than not be fired up.

2186
02:02:53.86 --> 02:02:56.98
So I'm like, I'm not scared of that kind of stuff, right?

2187
02:02:56.98 --> 02:02:59.30
And our jitter's necessary, though, that's the thing.

2188
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:01.82
That seems like we've discovered that we don't need them.

2189
02:03:01.82 --> 02:03:03.62
I didn't even think about that stuff.

2190
02:03:03.62 --> 02:03:05.78
To me, that's just what the pre workout was.

2191
02:03:05.78 --> 02:03:06.78
Good.

2192
02:03:06.78 --> 02:03:09.18
I'll take all of it, whatever you do whatever.

2193
02:03:09.18 --> 02:03:10.18
But it is.

2194
02:03:10.18 --> 02:03:11.18
And I read our realises.

2195
02:03:11.18 --> 02:03:13.78
Because I heard people say like, oh yeah, you drink this like tea.

2196
02:03:13.78 --> 02:03:14.98
They'd say this about some teas.

2197
02:03:14.98 --> 02:03:17.86
Like yeah, you're up, but it's like a smooth or whatever.

2198
02:03:17.86 --> 02:03:18.86
The smoothness or whatever.

2199
02:03:18.86 --> 02:03:20.34
I'm like cool man, smoothness.

2200
02:03:20.34 --> 02:03:21.34
Oh, good.

2201
02:03:21.34 --> 02:03:22.34
Whatever.

2202
02:03:22.34 --> 02:03:25.10
It just wasn't part of my world until I got the experience.

2203
02:03:25.10 --> 02:03:28.90
So the pre workout I took it, my cool thing is I haven't been doing pre workout for

2204
02:03:28.90 --> 02:03:30.54
like years now.

2205
02:03:30.54 --> 02:03:31.54
So I took this one.

2206
02:03:31.54 --> 02:03:32.54
I was like cool.

2207
02:03:32.54 --> 02:03:35.94
No jitteres, so I'm thinking, maybe juck was just sort of scared of the pre workout

2208
02:03:35.94 --> 02:03:36.94
experience.

2209
02:03:36.94 --> 02:03:38.26
I get it, you know, a little bit more mild.

2210
02:03:38.26 --> 02:03:40.46
I get it man, I get it.

2211
02:03:40.46 --> 02:03:43.54
But when you start warming up, that's when you feel it.

2212
02:03:43.54 --> 02:03:47.30
Like that when everything starts flowing, it's like it connects your brain to your freaking

2213
02:03:47.30 --> 02:03:48.86
body more or something.

2214
02:03:48.86 --> 02:03:49.86
That's a body experience.

2215
02:03:49.86 --> 02:03:50.86
That's what I'm saying.

2216
02:03:50.86 --> 02:03:53.38
Let me know in in in body experience.

2217
02:03:53.38 --> 02:04:01.86
Nonetheless, what I'm saying is what your daughter was talking about, I understand.

2218
02:04:01.86 --> 02:04:03.50
And it's true.

2219
02:04:03.50 --> 02:04:08.38
And yeah, I think it had to reevaluate my whole standard of the pre workout.

2220
02:04:08.38 --> 02:04:11.74
Because I knew like the pre workout I said I was taking, that's not good.

2221
02:04:11.74 --> 02:04:12.74
That's why I stopped.

2222
02:04:12.74 --> 02:04:13.74
Yeah.

2223
02:04:13.74 --> 02:04:17.14
Because I'm like cool, it's working, but probably I know I'm jamming myself out

2224
02:04:17.14 --> 02:04:18.14
of my heart.

2225
02:04:18.14 --> 02:04:19.54
I don't know what I'm jamming up on the inside.

2226
02:04:19.54 --> 02:04:20.54
But I'm jamming something up.

2227
02:04:20.54 --> 02:04:24.98
And yeah, man, now I know the new standard.

2228
02:04:24.98 --> 02:04:31.94
So you can get it that you can get your super hard workouts with a little extra kick.

2229
02:04:31.94 --> 02:04:36.42
Which might mean you need to protect yourself from a joint perspective a little bit more.

2230
02:04:36.42 --> 02:04:37.42
Let's go join warfare.

2231
02:04:37.42 --> 02:04:39.42
Let's go super curl.

2232
02:04:39.42 --> 02:04:45.54
Might as well keep your immunity in check because we're starting to work hard getting

2233
02:04:45.54 --> 02:04:48.02
like a needing recovery.

2234
02:04:48.02 --> 02:04:52.10
What, maybe the immune system's taking a little hit will get a little boost from some

2235
02:04:52.10 --> 02:04:55.14
cold war, some vitamin B3.

2236
02:04:55.14 --> 02:04:56.14
Kind of got you covered.

2237
02:04:56.14 --> 02:05:00.34
Yeah, you know, when you kind of like go down the list, you kind of like, it's a whole system.

2238
02:05:00.34 --> 02:05:01.34
Really.

2239
02:05:01.34 --> 02:05:05.74
And it's not the kind of like, like, I don't want to say useless because I don't want

2240
02:05:05.74 --> 02:05:10.34
to like put, put that kind of stigma on other types of supplements.

2241
02:05:10.34 --> 02:05:16.10
But it's like a whole system to stay very solidly like on the path.

2242
02:05:16.10 --> 02:05:17.10
And then you get on them.

2243
02:05:17.10 --> 02:05:19.34
We know we're kind of in squat season apparently.

2244
02:05:19.34 --> 02:05:24.18
But then you can be in squat season, which means you might want to get on board the

2245
02:05:24.18 --> 02:05:25.18
malt train.

2246
02:05:25.18 --> 02:05:26.18
Yes, sir.

2247
02:05:26.18 --> 02:05:29.86
Because you're going to need to he build from your activities.

2248
02:05:29.86 --> 02:05:30.86
Oh, yeah.

2249
02:05:30.86 --> 02:05:31.86
It's got activities.

2250
02:05:31.86 --> 02:05:35.58
So I, Scott, Scott, to this area.

2251
02:05:35.58 --> 02:05:38.46
I, two stakes the other day.

2252
02:05:38.46 --> 02:05:39.46
Concurrently like why?

2253
02:05:39.46 --> 02:05:42.98
Yeah, in one mirror, in one meal, just takes brown rice.

2254
02:05:42.98 --> 02:05:45.42
Because why would you just have one big stake?

2255
02:05:45.42 --> 02:05:47.70
Well, they were two medium stakes.

2256
02:05:47.70 --> 02:05:48.70
Okay.

2257
02:05:48.70 --> 02:05:49.70
I don't know.

2258
02:05:49.70 --> 02:05:50.70
That's the size you buy at the store.

2259
02:05:50.70 --> 02:05:51.70
Oh, yeah.

2260
02:05:51.70 --> 02:05:52.70
Oh, yeah.

2261
02:05:52.70 --> 02:05:58.18
I mean, maybe I could have went to the body, but you know, and I, that didn't happen.

2262
02:05:58.18 --> 02:06:00.14
How many ounces were you thinking?

2263
02:06:00.14 --> 02:06:01.14
What's the medium regular one?

2264
02:06:01.14 --> 02:06:03.62
You know, I have the thin one, the revised, right?

2265
02:06:03.62 --> 02:06:04.62
You have the thin, the buys.

2266
02:06:04.62 --> 02:06:07.90
And you have the super those super fat ones that you get from the guy behind the counter.

2267
02:06:07.90 --> 02:06:09.74
And then you have the regular medium ones.

2268
02:06:09.74 --> 02:06:10.74
Okay.

2269
02:06:10.74 --> 02:06:11.74
Yeah, two of those.

2270
02:06:11.74 --> 02:06:12.74
Two of the mediums.

2271
02:06:12.74 --> 02:06:13.74
Which was a lot.

2272
02:06:13.74 --> 02:06:15.38
Normally, it just happened.

2273
02:06:15.38 --> 02:06:16.38
Oh, my cool.

2274
02:06:16.38 --> 02:06:17.98
I needed some additional protein.

2275
02:06:17.98 --> 02:06:19.38
That's why came home late.

2276
02:06:19.38 --> 02:06:20.38
Didn't eat all day.

2277
02:06:20.38 --> 02:06:22.82
I was only having one meal, so I needed to double up on the protein.

2278
02:06:22.82 --> 02:06:23.82
Had to.

2279
02:06:23.82 --> 02:06:24.82
Hmm.

2280
02:06:24.82 --> 02:06:25.82
Some same brown rice.

2281
02:06:25.82 --> 02:06:27.42
But can't be doing that every day.

2282
02:06:27.42 --> 02:06:28.42
Some same.

2283
02:06:28.42 --> 02:06:29.66
I'm just saying it's not convenient.

2284
02:06:29.66 --> 02:06:31.78
And also, let's face it when you get done.

2285
02:06:31.78 --> 02:06:34.30
You still, these eye.

2286
02:06:34.30 --> 02:06:36.94
Even with the most dose rib eyes.

2287
02:06:36.94 --> 02:06:37.94
Yeah.

2288
02:06:37.94 --> 02:06:39.38
I can still get done with two rib eyes.

2289
02:06:39.38 --> 02:06:40.38
Marbled tasty.

2290
02:06:40.38 --> 02:06:41.38
Good.

2291
02:06:41.38 --> 02:06:42.38
Good.

2292
02:06:42.38 --> 02:06:43.38
Good.

2293
02:06:43.38 --> 02:06:44.38
Yeah.

2294
02:06:44.38 --> 02:06:47.98
I can still get done and want to have dessert.

2295
02:06:47.98 --> 02:06:48.98
What?

2296
02:06:48.98 --> 02:06:51.26
Now, what am I going to have for dessert?

2297
02:06:51.26 --> 02:06:55.98
Could I have something that is negates my physical progress?

2298
02:06:55.98 --> 02:06:56.98
I could.

2299
02:06:56.98 --> 02:06:58.38
Or I could just have milk.

2300
02:06:58.38 --> 02:06:59.38
Yeah.

2301
02:06:59.38 --> 02:07:00.98
That's one more step forward, you mean?

2302
02:07:00.98 --> 02:07:01.98
Oh, man.

2303
02:07:01.98 --> 02:07:02.98
So good.

2304
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:04.98
Once it hits the lips, bro.

2305
02:07:04.98 --> 02:07:06.98
It's so good.

2306
02:07:06.98 --> 02:07:09.38
Thank you, Joko, for the lips.

2307
02:07:09.38 --> 02:07:10.38
Thing.

2308
02:07:10.38 --> 02:07:11.38
That's from a movie.

2309
02:07:11.38 --> 02:07:12.38
You should have picked up on that.

2310
02:07:12.38 --> 02:07:13.38
I'll pick up on that.

2311
02:07:13.38 --> 02:07:14.22
No, bro.

2312
02:07:14.22 --> 02:07:16.22
I like that is the imagery of your lips.

2313
02:07:16.22 --> 02:07:17.22
No, that's it.

2314
02:07:17.22 --> 02:07:19.82
That's a Frank the Tank, man.

2315
02:07:19.82 --> 02:07:21.02
And what movies it?

2316
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:22.02
K dog.

2317
02:07:22.02 --> 02:07:23.02
Oh, it's cool.

2318
02:07:23.02 --> 02:07:24.02
It's cool.

2319
02:07:24.02 --> 02:07:25.02
Yeah.

2320
02:07:25.02 --> 02:07:26.02
He's talking about beer.

2321
02:07:26.02 --> 02:07:27.02
Like a beer funnel.

2322
02:07:27.02 --> 02:07:28.02
What is it called?

2323
02:07:28.02 --> 02:07:29.02
The beer funnel.

2324
02:07:29.02 --> 02:07:30.02
Beer.

2325
02:07:30.02 --> 02:07:31.02
Beer.

2326
02:07:31.02 --> 02:07:32.02
Yeah.

2327
02:07:32.02 --> 02:07:33.02
Beer.

2328
02:07:33.02 --> 02:07:34.02
Yeah.

2329
02:07:34.02 --> 02:07:35.02
Beer.

2330
02:07:35.02 --> 02:07:36.02
He's so good.

2331
02:07:36.02 --> 02:07:38.02
Once it hits the lips, it's kind of like milk.

2332
02:07:38.02 --> 02:07:39.02
It's the same feeling.

2333
02:07:39.02 --> 02:07:40.02
It's so good.

2334
02:07:40.02 --> 02:07:42.02
Once it hits the lips, you just, yes, or.

2335
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:43.02
Same thing.

2336
02:07:43.02 --> 02:07:44.02
I understand, fully.

2337
02:07:44.02 --> 02:07:45.02
But I think that's the new thing.

2338
02:07:45.02 --> 02:07:48.02
Get a grass fed, bison, rib, by smaller.

2339
02:07:48.02 --> 02:07:50.02
But, bro, it's kind of a dream.

2340
02:07:50.02 --> 02:07:53.82
Well, actually, the thing, you know, over at other people's houses right now is actually

2341
02:07:53.82 --> 02:07:54.82
milk.

2342
02:07:54.82 --> 02:07:55.82
All right.

2343
02:07:55.82 --> 02:07:56.82
That's right.

2344
02:07:56.82 --> 02:07:57.82
Yeah, that's right.

2345
02:07:57.82 --> 02:07:58.82
Yeah, that's good.

2346
02:07:58.82 --> 02:07:59.82
Yeah, that's good.

2347
02:07:59.82 --> 02:08:00.82
Yeah, that's good.

2348
02:08:00.82 --> 02:08:01.82
Yeah, that's good.

2349
02:08:01.82 --> 02:08:05.58
Out there, just, you know, you know, exactly where it came from.

2350
02:08:05.58 --> 02:08:06.58
Just elk in and up.

2351
02:08:06.58 --> 02:08:07.58
Yep.

2352
02:08:07.58 --> 02:08:08.58
Good.

2353
02:08:08.58 --> 02:08:09.58
We're there at the moment of truth.

2354
02:08:09.58 --> 02:08:10.58
Yeah.

2355
02:08:10.58 --> 02:08:11.58
Did it?

2356
02:08:11.58 --> 02:08:12.58
Good.

2357
02:08:12.58 --> 02:08:18.86
So, in the event of you not having elk in your freezer, in the case, maybe from your

2358
02:08:18.86 --> 02:08:25.82
hunt, as the case, maybe or double rib eyes at any given moment or bison steak.

2359
02:08:25.82 --> 02:08:26.82
Right.

2360
02:08:26.82 --> 02:08:27.82
You want some additional protein?

2361
02:08:27.82 --> 02:08:28.82
Mulk chain all day.

2362
02:08:28.82 --> 02:08:29.82
Mulk chain.

02:08:29.82 --> 02:08:32.06

Wow.

2367

You can get all of it at vitamin shop.

2369
02:08:39.10 --> 02:08:41.82
We appreciate those, those stores carrying this stuff.

2370

Because look, you might want to roll in there.

2371
02:08:44.06 --> 02:08:45.66
Yeah, it's really rolling there.

2372
02:08:45.66 --> 02:08:46.66
Roll in there.

2373
02:08:46.66 --> 02:08:47.66
Roll in a wall.

2374
02:08:47.66 --> 02:08:50.10
Get yourself a hogey and a go.

2375
02:08:50.10 --> 02:08:51.70
I didn't really know what a hogey was.

2376
02:08:51.70 --> 02:08:54.06
By the way, is that a East Coast thing or what?

2377
02:08:54.06 --> 02:08:55.06
Yes.

2378
02:08:55.06 --> 02:08:56.06
Yes.

2379
02:08:56.06 --> 02:08:58.86
There's a whole bunch of names for that particular subway sandwich.

2380
02:08:58.86 --> 02:08:59.86
Sub sandwich.

2381
02:08:59.86 --> 02:09:00.86
Sub sandwich.

2382
02:09:00.86 --> 02:09:02.26
What, you know what we used to call it?

2383
02:09:02.26 --> 02:09:03.26
Where I'm from grinder.

2384
02:09:03.26 --> 02:09:05.70
If you heard that before, it's not.

2385
02:09:05.70 --> 02:09:06.70
It's not.

2386
02:09:06.70 --> 02:09:09.90
My wife, who's from England, would call it a back.

2387
02:09:09.90 --> 02:09:10.90
AP.

2388
02:09:10.90 --> 02:09:11.90
That's not true.

2389
02:09:11.90 --> 02:09:12.90
That's true.

2390
02:09:12.90 --> 02:09:13.90
That's true.

2391
02:09:13.90 --> 02:09:14.90
There's some other ones I think were missing.

2392
02:09:14.90 --> 02:09:15.90
Oh, poor boy, poor boy.

2393
02:09:15.90 --> 02:09:16.90
Poor boy.

2394
02:09:16.90 --> 02:09:17.90
Poor boy.

2395
02:09:17.90 --> 02:09:18.90
That's another one.

2396
02:09:18.90 --> 02:09:20.90
So there's some names out there.

2397
02:09:20.90 --> 02:09:21.90
Yeah, all day.

2398
02:09:21.90 --> 02:09:22.90
Meanwhile.

2399
02:09:22.90 --> 02:09:24.90
Also, also, origin USA.

2400
02:09:24.90 --> 02:09:25.90
This is American-made stuff.

2401
02:09:25.90 --> 02:09:28.58
Look, you get, look, our health is together.

2402
02:09:28.58 --> 02:09:29.58
We know that, Erie.

2403
02:09:29.58 --> 02:09:30.58
We're standing in the path.

2404
02:09:30.58 --> 02:09:31.58
It's not.

2405
02:09:31.58 --> 02:09:32.58
Don't complicit on the path.

2406
02:09:32.58 --> 02:09:33.58
Right?

2407
02:09:33.58 --> 02:09:34.58
Yeah.

2408
02:09:34.58 --> 02:09:35.58
Look.

2409
02:09:35.58 --> 02:09:36.58
You want it as far as a parallel goes.

2410
02:09:36.58 --> 02:09:37.58
We all wear clothes.

2411
02:09:37.58 --> 02:09:38.58
Hopefully.

2412
02:09:38.58 --> 02:09:39.58
Well, maybe we wear clothes.

2413
02:09:39.58 --> 02:09:40.58
Yeah.

2414
02:09:40.58 --> 02:09:51.98
We want some iconic American-made attire denim jeans, boots, some shirts, some other leather

2415
02:09:51.98 --> 02:09:54.38
garalettes, belts, this kind of stuff.

2416
02:09:54.38 --> 02:09:56.26
What if it was all made in America?

2417
02:09:56.26 --> 02:09:57.26
Oh, it is.

2418
02:09:57.26 --> 02:09:58.26
What is it?

2419
02:09:58.26 --> 02:10:00.26
By the way, but you want that bison steak?

2420
02:10:00.26 --> 02:10:01.26
Cool.

2421
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:02.26
How about that bison boots?

2422
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:03.26
Oh, yeah.

2423
02:10:03.26 --> 02:10:04.26
Made in America.

2424
02:10:04.26 --> 02:10:05.26
A couple leather.

2425
02:10:05.26 --> 02:10:07.26
We were able to use the terms, so I'll go.

2426
02:10:07.26 --> 02:10:10.26
I think I did one time and I was very uncomfortable.

2427
02:10:10.26 --> 02:10:11.26
Yeah.

2428
02:10:11.26 --> 02:10:15.02
I'm going to use it again right now, describing some bison boots, which are supple.

2429
02:10:15.02 --> 02:10:16.02
All right.

2430
02:10:16.02 --> 02:10:17.02
There you go.

2431
02:10:17.02 --> 02:10:18.02
You heard it here.

2432
02:10:18.02 --> 02:10:19.02
Look, go.

2433
02:10:19.02 --> 02:10:22.62
But yes, but everything made in America from the materials, the raw materials, grown

2434
02:10:22.62 --> 02:10:23.62
in America.

2435
02:10:23.62 --> 02:10:27.18
Everything all the way up to the jeans you wearing on your hips.

2436
02:10:27.18 --> 02:10:29.50
And so you're good 24 hours a day.

2437
02:10:29.50 --> 02:10:33.02
Because you got also, because we're training to jitter, you got your jitter geek.

2438
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:34.02
You got to rift geeks.

2439
02:10:34.02 --> 02:10:36.38
You're never going to get another kind of geek in.

2440
02:10:36.38 --> 02:10:37.38
Oh, yeah.

2441
02:10:37.38 --> 02:10:39.02
So the whole system is accounted for.

2442
02:10:39.02 --> 02:10:40.02
Yeah.

2443
02:10:40.02 --> 02:10:41.02
So the first thing I did was do the game.

2444
02:10:41.02 --> 02:10:42.02
It's true.

2445
02:10:42.02 --> 02:10:48.06
Or junior say dot com also, jitter, so now you want to go into straight up representing

2446
02:10:48.06 --> 02:10:53.18
on the path like a choice, a contrast choice to represent.

2447
02:10:53.18 --> 02:10:58.90
Is there a psychological hit that you get when you were a little kid?

2448
02:10:58.90 --> 02:10:59.90
You got new sneakers.

2449
02:10:59.90 --> 02:11:00.90
Yes, sir.

2450
02:11:00.90 --> 02:11:01.90
We're running a little bit faster.

2451
02:11:01.90 --> 02:11:02.90
Yes, sir.

2452
02:11:02.90 --> 02:11:03.90
We're on the path.

2453
02:11:03.90 --> 02:11:07.02
We put on a freaking t-shirt that says, dear spleen equals freedom.

2454
02:11:07.02 --> 02:11:09.38
Do we go a little bit harder in the pain?

2455
02:11:09.38 --> 02:11:09.98
Yes, we do.

2456
02:11:09.98 --> 02:11:12.94
So there's a thing that sounds like, oh, that's kind of like funny.

2457
02:11:12.94 --> 02:11:13.94
You're right.

2458
02:11:13.94 --> 02:11:14.94
It's absolutely true.

2459
02:11:14.94 --> 02:11:16.74
And here's the thing, do an experiment.

2460
02:11:16.74 --> 02:11:17.74
The science.

2461
02:11:17.74 --> 02:11:19.74
Where's the wear?

2462
02:11:19.74 --> 02:11:22.46
A shirt or a hoodie or whatever says this will equals freedom.

2463
02:11:22.46 --> 02:11:23.70
Look in the mirror and eat a cookie.

2464
02:11:23.70 --> 02:11:26.02
See how I'm not saying not going to be able to eat the cookies.

2465
02:11:26.02 --> 02:11:27.02
I'm not saying that.

2466
02:11:27.02 --> 02:11:29.34
It's going to be a hard way harder.

2467
02:11:29.34 --> 02:11:30.34
Yes.

2468
02:11:30.34 --> 02:11:31.34
Oh, yeah.

2469
02:11:31.34 --> 02:11:34.34
So now if you're just in your everyday life, but you're representing.

2470
02:11:34.34 --> 02:11:38.14
But the chances of you flipping off the path, even for that moment.

2471
02:11:38.14 --> 02:11:40.98
I actually feel bad we haven't put this word out before.

2472
02:11:40.98 --> 02:11:41.98
Because this is important.

2473
02:11:41.98 --> 02:11:43.38
It's like the same.

2474
02:11:43.38 --> 02:11:44.78
It's kind of important.

2475
02:11:44.78 --> 02:11:45.78
It is.

2476
02:11:45.78 --> 02:11:46.78
Yes, sir.

2477
02:11:46.78 --> 02:11:47.78
It's true.

2478
02:11:47.78 --> 02:11:51.06
It just sort of applies like if you're just representing the general in general,

2479
02:11:51.06 --> 02:11:53.50
it's just that much more efficient way of staying on the path.

2480
02:11:53.50 --> 02:11:54.86
So I'm saying, and let's face it.

2481
02:11:54.86 --> 02:11:57.46
You see somebody else representing your representing this.

2482
02:11:57.46 --> 02:11:58.46
The collegian.

2483
02:11:58.46 --> 02:11:59.46
Right.

2484
02:11:59.46 --> 02:12:01.06
Now we're even stronger together together.

2485
02:12:01.06 --> 02:12:03.58
Also, the shirt locker.

2486
02:12:03.58 --> 02:12:04.98
This is a part of Jocco's store.

2487
02:12:04.98 --> 02:12:05.98
It's a part.

2488
02:12:05.98 --> 02:12:09.94
Choose the sign up for shirt locker. You're going to new shirt every month with.

2489
02:12:09.94 --> 02:12:10.94
Did you change the word?

2490
02:12:10.94 --> 02:12:11.94
Creative designs.

2491
02:12:11.94 --> 02:12:12.94
You said something.

2492
02:12:12.94 --> 02:12:16.34
Well, now there's actually bad ass because the new one that just came out is.

2493
02:12:16.34 --> 02:12:17.82
And it's new.

2494
02:12:17.82 --> 02:12:20.82
It's like a new scenario.

2495
02:12:20.82 --> 02:12:22.62
It's a tank.

2496
02:12:22.62 --> 02:12:26.50
There's kettlebells flying off, which I noticed.

2497
02:12:26.50 --> 02:12:27.62
You did run into the kettlebells.

2498
02:12:27.62 --> 02:12:30.14
There's kettlebells flying through the air.

2499
02:12:30.14 --> 02:12:33.42
I'm riding this tank sort of in a aggressive hospital kind of way.

2500
02:12:33.42 --> 02:12:34.42
We're in a deaf court.

2501
02:12:34.42 --> 02:12:35.66
We're in a deaf court.

2502
02:12:35.66 --> 02:12:36.66
Which I'm wearing right now.

2503
02:12:36.66 --> 02:12:39.38
By the way, maybe I just dismounted my tank and showed up here to tell you his

2504
02:12:39.38 --> 02:12:40.38
forecast.

2505
02:12:40.38 --> 02:12:41.38
Two machine guns.

2506
02:12:41.38 --> 02:12:42.38
Two machine guns.

2507
02:12:42.38 --> 02:12:45.86
And the tank is an M1 Abrams tank.

2508
02:12:45.86 --> 02:12:46.86
By the way.

2509
02:12:46.86 --> 02:12:49.06
So you have a good depiction.

2510
02:12:49.06 --> 02:12:51.38
When it looks like a comic book thing, that's what made it because kind of a

2511
02:12:51.38 --> 02:12:52.38
dope thing.

2512
02:12:52.38 --> 02:12:53.38
Yeah.

2513
02:12:53.38 --> 02:12:55.86
I commend your work there.

2514
02:12:55.86 --> 02:12:56.86
Commended.

2515
02:12:56.86 --> 02:13:02.54
The bad news is that was last month's shirt.

2516
02:13:02.54 --> 02:13:04.98
Like this past month's shirt.

2517
02:13:04.98 --> 02:13:07.70
The good news is when you're signed up as short, long as I don't care if you

2518
02:13:07.70 --> 02:13:10.50
sign up next year, you can still get that shirt if you want.

2519
02:13:10.50 --> 02:13:11.82
If access to that shirt.

2520
02:13:11.82 --> 02:13:12.82
If you signed up.

2521
02:13:12.82 --> 02:13:15.06
So, boom, nowhere is anyway.

2522
02:13:15.06 --> 02:13:16.06
Yeah.

2523
02:13:16.06 --> 02:13:17.06
Jockels.com.

2524
02:13:17.06 --> 02:13:18.06
You want to represent.

2525
02:13:18.06 --> 02:13:19.06
Boom.

2526
02:13:19.06 --> 02:13:20.06
That's where you can get the stuff to represent.

2527
02:13:20.06 --> 02:13:22.06
Speaking of subscription.

2528
02:13:22.06 --> 02:13:23.06
Subscribe to this podcast.

2529
02:13:23.06 --> 02:13:25.74
Don't forget about unravelling podcasts, grounded podcast.

2530
02:13:25.74 --> 02:13:26.74
War your kid podcast.

2531
02:13:26.74 --> 02:13:31.30
I got to ask by kids at Jockel Live, which by the way is Jockel Live in Austin.

2532
02:13:31.30 --> 02:13:37.30
Coming up Saturday night, Austin, Texas, November 20th.

2533
02:13:37.30 --> 02:13:42.78
So, we're going to come to that and ask me questions or hang out or listen to me talk.

2534
02:13:42.78 --> 02:13:45.06
Come check that out, but also where you're kid podcast.

2535
02:13:45.06 --> 02:13:50.90
We also have Jockel on the ground, which again, we have contingency plans.

2536
02:13:50.90 --> 02:13:55.18
We will recently, we will recently shadow ban.

2537
02:13:55.18 --> 02:13:56.18
Shadow ban.

2538
02:13:56.18 --> 02:13:58.62
Yeah, forgot Shadow ban.

2539
02:13:58.62 --> 02:14:00.50
On Instagram.

2540
02:14:00.50 --> 02:14:01.82
We know people going to why.

2541
02:14:01.82 --> 02:14:02.82
Why do you get shadow ban?

2542
02:14:02.82 --> 02:14:03.82
That's the problem.

2543
02:14:03.82 --> 02:14:04.82
We don't know why.

2544
02:14:04.82 --> 02:14:06.46
We have some suspicions.

2545
02:14:06.46 --> 02:14:09.06
We're going to talk about it on the underground.

2546
02:14:09.06 --> 02:14:13.26
I'm going to explain the reasons why I think the Shadow ban might have come.

2547
02:14:13.26 --> 02:14:15.94
I've been on Shadow ban now apparently.

2548
02:14:15.94 --> 02:14:19.34
We have information.

2549
02:14:19.34 --> 02:14:20.34
We do have information.

2550
02:14:20.34 --> 02:14:24.50
We've got troopers in, let's just say, we have a place.

2551
02:14:24.50 --> 02:14:27.10
Something we call access in placement.

2552
02:14:27.10 --> 02:14:28.70
We have people.

2553
02:14:28.70 --> 02:14:31.90
So we will hopefully not let that happen again.

2554
02:14:31.90 --> 02:14:34.14
But look, it can happen.

2555
02:14:34.14 --> 02:14:40.78
And that's where we made Jockel on the ground in case mayhem happens in case we get locked

2556
02:14:40.78 --> 02:14:41.62
down.

2557
02:14:41.62 --> 02:14:44.14
We don't control these platforms that you're listening to this on.

2558
02:14:44.14 --> 02:14:45.62
We do control Jockel on the ground.

2559
02:14:45.62 --> 02:14:51.82
If you want to help support us, it costs $8.18 a month because we appreciate that support

2560
02:14:51.82 --> 02:14:53.82
to have that contingency plan set up.

2561
02:14:53.82 --> 02:14:55.46
We make an extra podcast.

2562
02:14:55.46 --> 02:14:56.14
Jockel on the ground.

2563
02:14:56.14 --> 02:14:57.98
We talk about other subjects.

2564
02:14:57.98 --> 02:14:58.98
We talk about Jockel on the ground.

2565
02:14:58.98 --> 02:15:15.34
If you can't afford it, we still want, we're still, you're still with us.

2566
02:15:15.34 --> 02:15:17.10
You can't afford that $8.18 a month.

2567
02:15:17.10 --> 02:15:19.14
Just email assistance at Jockel on the ground.com.

2568
02:15:19.14 --> 02:15:20.62
We'll get you access to it.

2569
02:15:20.62 --> 02:15:23.22
We have a YouTube channel.

2570
02:15:23.22 --> 02:15:24.22
You can subscribe to that.

2571
02:15:24.22 --> 02:15:27.78
Or you're subscribed to the origin, USA, YouTube channel for some behind the scenes.

2572
02:15:27.78 --> 02:15:30.34
We got an album called Psychological Warfare.

2573
02:15:30.34 --> 02:15:35.46
If you need a little help in a moment of weakness.

2574
02:15:35.46 --> 02:15:39.54
And look, we could make an album where you have a moment of weakness and we pre-press

2575
02:15:39.54 --> 02:15:41.26
of the track.

2576
02:15:41.26 --> 02:15:47.78
And it's echo talking about Rubik's Cube for 15 minutes with no logical meaning behind it.

2577
02:15:47.78 --> 02:15:48.78
That part's incorrect.

2578
02:15:48.78 --> 02:15:49.78
Very much logic.

2579
02:15:49.78 --> 02:15:50.78
Yes.

2580
02:15:50.78 --> 02:15:51.78
But we did.

2581
02:15:51.78 --> 02:15:52.78
We didn't do that.

2582
02:15:52.78 --> 02:15:53.78
Maybe we'll do that.

2583
02:15:53.78 --> 02:15:58.02
People that have more time to overcome their weakness.

2584
02:15:58.02 --> 02:15:59.90
But if you want to get that, go to wherever you get M.P.

2585
02:15:59.90 --> 02:16:01.98
Threes, you can get Psychological Warfare.

2586
02:16:01.98 --> 02:16:03.34
I am the artist.

2587
02:16:03.34 --> 02:16:04.34
Yeah.

2588
02:16:04.34 --> 02:16:05.90
Because this is artist's name.

2589
02:16:05.90 --> 02:16:06.90
Jockel.

2590
02:16:06.90 --> 02:16:07.90
Jockel.

2591
02:16:07.90 --> 02:16:08.90
Yeah.

2592
02:16:08.90 --> 02:16:09.90
So there you go.

2593
02:16:09.90 --> 02:16:10.90
Flipside Canvas.

2594
02:16:10.90 --> 02:16:13.62
Dakota Meyer making just awesome stuff.

2595
02:16:13.62 --> 02:16:17.66
He started a distribution company, by the way, is not in Texas.

2596
02:16:17.66 --> 02:16:20.78
I'm investing in his beverage distribution company.

2597
02:16:20.78 --> 02:16:26.02
He started going out proactively delivering Jockel Goal to various stories.

2598
02:16:26.02 --> 02:16:27.82
And now he's got people ordering it.

2599
02:16:27.82 --> 02:16:30.50
Brother, that's an anti-authoritarian is sick.

2600
02:16:30.50 --> 02:16:33.78
My head's freaking Dakota Meyer doing the M.P.

2601
02:16:33.78 --> 02:16:35.02
I'm always going to make things happen.

2602
02:16:35.02 --> 02:16:36.02
You think it's whatever.

2603
02:16:36.02 --> 02:16:37.02
Who's in what?

2604
02:16:37.02 --> 02:16:38.02
There's someone in the way.

2605
02:16:38.02 --> 02:16:39.02
Cool.

2606
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.02
I just outmaneuvered them.

2607
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.02
Oh, there's some distribution company that didn't want to make the connection.

2608
02:16:43.02 --> 02:16:44.02
Oh, cool.

2609
02:16:44.02 --> 02:16:45.90
Dakota Meyer is just in a truck.

2610
02:16:45.90 --> 02:16:47.06
Oh, yeah.

2611
02:16:47.06 --> 02:16:48.06
Making it happen.

2612
02:16:48.06 --> 02:16:50.74
I think he signed up 40 stores right now.

2613
02:16:50.74 --> 02:16:51.74
Oh, my man.

2614
02:16:51.74 --> 02:16:52.74
What?

2615
02:16:52.74 --> 02:16:53.74
Hey, what's going on?

2616
02:16:53.74 --> 02:16:55.14
Oh, I'll figure it out.

2617
02:16:55.14 --> 02:16:57.14
Make it happen.

2618
02:16:57.14 --> 02:16:58.14
So there you go.

2619
02:16:58.14 --> 02:17:01.26
He's also got, he's also selling stuff to hang on your wall.

2620
02:17:01.26 --> 02:17:04.10
Flipside Canvas.com, going order something cool there.

2621
02:17:04.10 --> 02:17:05.34
Got some books.

2622
02:17:05.34 --> 02:17:06.34
Final spin.

2623
02:17:06.34 --> 02:17:09.22
It's out right now.

2624
02:17:09.22 --> 02:17:10.62
We don't even know what it is.

2625
02:17:10.62 --> 02:17:12.34
Novel poem.

2626
02:17:12.34 --> 02:17:17.10
We know that it brings tears to J.P. to NL, to NL crying in the play.

2627
02:17:17.10 --> 02:17:20.62
And in public, check that out.

2628
02:17:20.62 --> 02:17:23.94
Leadership Strategy and Tax Field Manual, code valuation, protocol, discipline, and

2629
02:17:23.94 --> 02:17:24.94
freedom field manual.

2630
02:17:24.94 --> 02:17:26.34
Way of the word, kid, one, two, three, four.

2631
02:17:26.34 --> 02:17:30.94
Get them freaking books for your kids or kids, as you know.

2632
02:17:30.94 --> 02:17:36.34
It's sort of, if you have the ability to get those books for some kid that you know,

2633
02:17:36.34 --> 02:17:40.70
and you don't, you are, you're not a good person.

2634
02:17:40.70 --> 02:17:42.50
You're not a good person.

2635
02:17:42.50 --> 02:17:46.46
If you know a kid and you don't get them those books, you're not, you're hurting those

2636
02:17:46.46 --> 02:17:47.46
kids.

2637
02:17:47.46 --> 02:17:49.98
This is factual.

2638
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.46
So whatever, I know I've met some really cool people lately.

2639
02:17:54.46 --> 02:17:58.58
I met someone down at the master, GJ2, GJ2 player.

2640
02:17:58.58 --> 02:18:02.46
He's like, oh, I carry way the word, you're kid in my bag.

2641
02:18:02.46 --> 02:18:04.34
Any kid that I meet, they're getting it.

2642
02:18:04.34 --> 02:18:07.94
He's just helping kids worldwide.

2643
02:18:07.94 --> 02:18:11.54
So do that.

2644
02:18:11.54 --> 02:18:13.02
Put it in your bag, carried around.

2645
02:18:13.02 --> 02:18:15.58
You see a kid, you're going to kid, here you go.

2646
02:18:15.58 --> 02:18:16.58
Imagine that.

2647
02:18:16.58 --> 02:18:20.54
You can influence the rest of someone's life by doing that.

2648
02:18:20.54 --> 02:18:22.82
So where the word kid, one, two, three.

2649
02:18:22.82 --> 02:18:23.82
Mike in the dragons.

2650
02:18:23.82 --> 02:18:27.34
Apparently the best, what age group is that?

2651
02:18:27.34 --> 02:18:28.34
Little kids.

2652
02:18:28.34 --> 02:18:29.34
What do you call them?

2653
02:18:29.34 --> 02:18:30.34
Little kids.

2654
02:18:30.34 --> 02:18:31.34
Like post, taught.

2655
02:18:31.34 --> 02:18:32.34
I don't know what they're called.

2656
02:18:32.34 --> 02:18:34.54
That age group is probably the most level.

2657
02:18:34.54 --> 02:18:35.54
Yep.

2658
02:18:35.54 --> 02:18:41.42
Mike in the dragons, get your kids to overcome fear.

2659
02:18:41.42 --> 02:18:46.90
Back worth about face, wrote the forward to that one and honor.

2660
02:18:46.90 --> 02:18:50.22
And then of course, extreme ownership in the decademy of leadership.

2661
02:18:50.22 --> 02:18:52.86
And we have National Front Leadership Consultancy.

2662
02:18:52.86 --> 02:18:54.86
myself and my brother, Dave Babin.

2663
02:18:54.86 --> 02:18:55.86
We started that.

2664
02:18:55.86 --> 02:18:59.06
Now we got a big bunch of team, a big team of people.

2665
02:18:59.06 --> 02:19:01.42
And what we do is solve problems with leadership.

2666
02:19:01.42 --> 02:19:03.74
The solution is leadership.

2667
02:19:03.74 --> 02:19:05.86
Whatever's going on in your organization, the solution is leadership.

2668
02:19:05.86 --> 02:19:09.06
Go to eslamfront.com for details on that.

2669
02:19:09.06 --> 02:19:13.82

2674
02:19:24.22 --> 02:19:26.22
November 20th.

2675
02:19:26.22 --> 02:19:28.06
Come and check it out.

2676
02:19:28.06 --> 02:19:31.54
We have online training, extreme ownership academy.

2677
02:19:31.54 --> 02:19:35.90
You do not learn any of this stuff overnight.

2678
02:19:35.90 --> 02:19:39.02
You have to train in it just like Gigiitsu, just like playing guitar,

2679
02:19:39.02 --> 02:19:41.06
just like shooting basketball.

2680
02:19:41.06 --> 02:19:43.66
You need to train continually.

2681
02:19:43.66 --> 02:19:48.26
Go to extreme ownership.com to get your leadership skills.

2682
02:19:48.26 --> 02:19:49.26
Home.

2683
02:19:49.26 --> 02:19:54.30
And if you want to help service members active and retired their families, go to our families.

2684
02:19:54.30 --> 02:19:56.66
Mark Lee's mom, mom Lee.

2685
02:19:56.66 --> 02:19:57.66
She's got a charity organization.

2686
02:19:57.66 --> 02:20:02.30
If you want to donate, or you want to get involved, go to America's MightyWorriers.org.

2687
02:20:02.30 --> 02:20:08.54
And if you want more of my excruciating explanations, or you need more of Echos, convoluted

2688
02:20:08.54 --> 02:20:11.30
connections to Rubik's cubes.

2689
02:20:11.30 --> 02:20:12.30
Welcome.

2690
02:20:12.30 --> 02:20:13.30
Welcome.

2691
02:20:13.30 --> 02:20:14.30
Welcome.

2692
02:20:14.30 --> 02:20:15.30
Echos, adequate.

2693
02:20:15.30 --> 02:20:18.90
I am at Jockel Willing and to all the troops out there around the world standing

2694
02:20:18.90 --> 02:20:20.42
watching, keeping us safe.

2695
02:20:20.42 --> 02:20:24.62
Thank you for your service and sacrifice and to our police and law enforcement.

2696
02:20:24.62 --> 02:20:29.14
Firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret

2697
02:20:29.14 --> 02:20:32.38
service, and all first responders.

2698
02:20:32.38 --> 02:20:33.54
Thank you for your service.

2699
02:20:33.54 --> 02:20:36.86
Here at home to keep us safe.

2700
02:20:36.86 --> 02:20:45.30
And everyone else out there may be asking yourself that question if you are possibly incompetent.

2701
02:20:45.30 --> 02:20:48.70
And I hope you're not.

2702
02:20:48.70 --> 02:20:50.74
But how do you avoid being incompetent?

2703
02:20:50.74 --> 02:20:54.46
Number one lesson from this book is something that we talk about all the time.

2704
02:20:54.46 --> 02:20:55.90
Be humble, listen.

2705
02:20:55.90 --> 02:21:03.42
Don't think you know everything because you don't.

2706
02:21:03.42 --> 02:21:04.42
Be humble.

2707
02:21:04.42 --> 02:21:05.98
Keep an open mind.

2708
02:21:05.98 --> 02:21:15.58
The thing that traps your mind, the thing that traps your mind is your mind.

2709
02:21:15.58 --> 02:21:21.54
So pry it open, keep it open and go get after it.

2710
02:21:21.54 --> 02:21:36.98
Until next time, Zekko and Jockel.
