00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 This is jocopondcast number 212 with me jocowooiling.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000 The path of jujitsu is hard.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000 It is a hard path.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000 You have ups and downs.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000 And there are times when you've got to work and there are times when you get injured and there are times when you get mentally defeated.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 And you feel like you don't want to do it anymore.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000 And those days go on and on and on.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000 But if you do the right thing and you stay on the path over time, you will move forward on that path.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000 You will move forward on that path.
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000 If you keep your nose to the grindstone.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000 You move forward on that path.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000 If you have the humility to say, you know what?
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000 I still have more to learn.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000 And that's the same way it works with life.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000 You're going to have ups and downs in life.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000 Things are going to go wrong.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000 You're going to lose businesses.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000 You're going to lose jobs.
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000 You're going to break up.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000 Things are going to go wrong.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000 And what you need to do is to keep moving forward.
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000 No matter what happens, keep moving forward.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000 And you're just who is representative of life.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000 If you stay humble and you stay on that path,
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000 you will end up achieving your goal.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 That will happen.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 And it did happen.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000 It happened to my friend here, echo Charles,
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000 and those are the words that I said in August
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000 when he received the black belt.
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000 The black belt.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000 It always referred to the black belt.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000 If there's only one in the world, the black belt.
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000 He received the black belt in GJ2.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000 And it was not an easy path.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000 And there was much learned along the way,
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000 not just about GJ2, but about life.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 And so I told echo at that time,
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000 at some point, we would discuss that journey on the podcast.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000 So here we are.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Good evening echo.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000 Good evening.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000 So we did, I did immediately say,
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000 well, probably not immediately, but a few hours after you got your black belt.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000 And it was a lot.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000 We were a lot of people talking, you know,
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 we're at origin camp.
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000 We were all talking about everyone getting their black belts.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000 You get your black belt.
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000 What it's like to get your black belt.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000 All the things that you'd been through.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000 And I said, you know what, we just got it.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000 This is what we'll do.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 We need to do a podcast about this because it's a journey.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000 Yeah.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 And you know what's interesting too.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000 I was thinking about this.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000 Our last guest, Joel Strothers.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000 When he came in and we before we started recording,
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000 he was, he was very humbled to be here.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000 He's like, man, it's like, yeah, kind of feel.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 You know, here we are.
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000 We haven't these guys that were from sod that were Vietnam.
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000 The Vietnam Medal of Honor recipients.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000 I mean, just really just a steamed guests on the podcast.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 And Joel's kind of like, you know, he's a humble guy.
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000 And what I realized is, I said, well, you know, I'm thinking of myself.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000 I'm still going to learn from you.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000 You know, I'm looking at Joel.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000 I mean, he did some really cool stuff.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000 Had a good six years in the French foreign legion.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000 Learn some cool lessons.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000 I want to learn those lessons too.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000 So when I talk to you, like, I want to learn what you learned.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 I want to learn from you.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 And that's part of what makes me,
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000 keep trying get better.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 That's what makes me get better.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000 I'm going to learn from everyone.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000 You know, you hear someone say, you even learn something from a white belt.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000 Yeah.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000 You know, that's like I say, it's actually true.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000 You hear, you hear a seal said, oh, you could still learn something from a new guy.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000 It's not just to say it's true.
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000 Yeah.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000 So with that,
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000 also some people have asked, you know, over the years, like, how did you and I meet?
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000 Yeah.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000 So I think that's probably a good place to start because we did meet from Jiu-Jitsu.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000 So how do we meet?
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Go.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Well, in Jiu-Jitsu.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000 Actually, I remember it probably earlier than you do.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000 But you know, but when you say like how you can learn something from anyone, right?
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000 Like, oh, this, I think, I mean, you learning something from me or whatever.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000 And I'll see it in your face every once in a while when I'll say something.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000 It's almost like you're kind of computing and calculating like my interpretation of a certain event or incident.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Versus your interpretation of it.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000 So it's kind of like, oh, it's almost like something's clicking in your eye.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Like, think, okay.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000 So that's what you saw during this, you know, like so you can almost kind of kind of formulate
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000 how you come off a little bit more accurately, you know, how you impress on.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000 To like the world.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000 Absolutely, getting feedback from someone on how they interpret what you're saying is absolutely.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000 Yeah.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000 Because you could be like, oh, yeah, like, I'm, I said that so well, you know, like, I was so clear.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000 So like it even sounded dope the way I said it, you know.
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000 And then they're like, yeah, you, you know, you sound like an arrogant when you said anything.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000 You know, like, yeah, it's more accurate.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000 Yes, yeah, a little one that was off, you know, over shot the target, under shot the target.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 If you don't communicate with the target, you don't know.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Yes.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000 Yeah.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000 So all right.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000 So yeah, so we met when I first met you was I was a white belt at the boxing club.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000 Mm-hmm.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000 He was like, I remember this zero.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000 Yeah.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000 I remember meeting you and I'm literally thinking of like the look in your eye, thinking like you will not remember this.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000 Yeah.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000 But I knew of you.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000 I seen you before over at over at a number kid.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 So Dean Lister opened a little spot.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000 It was half of a marsh of a karate gym.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000 So he kind of, I don't know if he just was an easy.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000 Yes.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000 Yeah.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000 And he had half of it.
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000 He put this big curtain.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000 Yeah.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000 It's like the karate class in our class.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000 So I was, I went down there.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000 That's where I joined.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000 And I saw you there.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000 And I had heard about you from like Dean and some interviews that he did or whatever.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 And then that's when I seen you.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 But I didn't talk to you or nothing like that.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000 And there was like a weekend or something.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000 And then you know how we would go there to the boxing club, which is a different gym.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 More of a gym or boxing gym with you, to an MMA.
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000 So we'd go from there to the boxing club there and walk, you know, we kind of be training at vote.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000 Yeah.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000 You were.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000 I only trained at the place in East Lake like a probably 10 times because it was a far away.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000 Yeah.
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000 You know, by far away, I mean like 35 minutes or something like that.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000 But it's pretty far.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000 Well, yeah.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000 It's pretty hot.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000 When you're at the boxing club, it was pretty close.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000 Victory is a close fist.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000 It's a good strategic.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000 But nonetheless, when I first rode with you was at the boxing club when we were done with the
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000 South of the, the, the, the, the, the July vista place or East Lake place.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000 And then yeah.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000 So I rolled with you and you, you know, I won't wipe out at this time.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000 And yeah, you can, you know beat me up whatever.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000 And then I remember you did this move that you still, she, you'll still try to do this move to me.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.56 do this move to me? I don't remember it working any time recently, but it's
00:07:53.56 --> 00:07:58.72 where you kind of can't be doing this after. You've been me down inside
00:07:58.72 --> 00:08:02.48 my side control and you basically do a forum across the neck. Okay, yeah, yeah.
00:08:02.48 --> 00:08:05.92 Kind of scenario and if your head is facing a certain way, it's really hard to get
00:08:05.92 --> 00:08:10.96 out. Yes, you're right. So you did that to me. I think one, maybe two times just
00:08:10.96 --> 00:08:14.76 a real surprise move because no one thinks that they can get choked there. But
00:08:14.76 --> 00:08:17.56 you actually can't get choked there. You can tap out. I tap out people with that
00:08:17.56 --> 00:08:21.36 move. Yes. Yeah. And me as a white belt, I didn't know or I didn't have that
00:08:21.36 --> 00:08:24.32 preconceived notion that you can't get tapped out. I didn't even have that. I was
00:08:24.32 --> 00:08:30.64 brand new and so you did it and I was like, oh cool. And now in that at that point,
00:08:30.64 --> 00:08:35.68 I was like, I was one of these guys who asked a lot of questions. Like a lot of
00:08:35.68 --> 00:08:38.96 questions. Like anything I saw for the first time, I'm like, hey, how'd you do
00:08:38.96 --> 00:08:44.32 how'd you do? So I asked you, but you're still kind of like this, where
00:08:44.32 --> 00:08:49.64 when you meet someone like you don't, you don't, how should I say exchange
00:08:49.64 --> 00:08:54.64 pleasantries that much? Yeah, that's true. I, you know, I actually have more
00:08:54.64 --> 00:09:00.20 conscious of it now when I meet people like let's say, if I meet someone that's
00:09:00.20 --> 00:09:04.32 sort of like listens to the podcast, obviously like I'm cold on because there's
00:09:04.32 --> 00:09:07.76 some kind of connection. But for sure, never in my life, if I've been a person
00:09:07.76 --> 00:09:13.20 where I meet someone and I'm, you know, having some big open conversation with
00:09:13.20 --> 00:09:17.72 them, that's not really it's weird because because, you know, kind of what I do
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:27.36 for a living now is basically talk and and I, not a big talker in, if I don't
00:09:27.36 --> 00:09:30.04 know people, yeah, but I don't know people, if I go to a party like I would go
00:09:30.04 --> 00:09:34.96 to like, let's say some kind of a whatever party with my wife and just not talk
00:09:34.96 --> 00:09:38.76 that. And not, not, not, not look, I'm not like standing in order of brooding at
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:43.32 people in a jerk, but I'm not going to make a big connection with a lot of people
00:09:43.32 --> 00:09:47.72 right now if someone's got cauliflower here or something, you might open up a
00:09:47.72 --> 00:09:52.64 little square, yeah, but yeah, yeah, fully like you're not the guy who's, you know,
00:09:52.64 --> 00:09:56.68 in the corner telling all the story, not looking back for us is whatever, yeah,
00:09:56.68 --> 00:10:04.72 fully. And and back then you were like that as well. So even like even like when you
00:10:04.72 --> 00:10:08.56 make small talk nowadays, if you, if you kind of see someone and you're like, you're
00:10:08.56 --> 00:10:12.48 whatever, even your small talk is like, and I'm comparing this to knowing you know,
00:10:12.48 --> 00:10:16.76 for however long, you can, there's like huge disconnect, like a huge, and I don't
00:10:16.76 --> 00:10:21.12 mean in a bad way, it's just more like you're, you're doing it kind of in this
00:10:21.12 --> 00:10:25.24 almost like an official way, you know, where it's like you're not open kind of
00:10:25.24 --> 00:10:29.72 thing. And it may be me saying even talking about it makes it seem like a bigger deal
00:10:29.72 --> 00:10:35.92 than it is, but it's there big time. So back then, oh, it was there huge time. So you're
00:10:35.92 --> 00:10:41.76 like, over there, you're like, yeah, like this is blank look. Like, yeah, man, like good,
00:10:41.76 --> 00:10:46.12 you know, whatever, strong, whatever, you know, giving, doing the same, they're correct
00:10:46.12 --> 00:10:51.12 stuff. That's cool, but like, like a like a shark with Slack. I just got there.
00:10:51.12 --> 00:10:58.12 Just glad. That's funny because that's exactly how I feel. Yeah. And that's what I
00:10:58.12 --> 00:11:01.96 heard too. So that was like, and I, and I, I kind of just admit,
00:11:01.96 --> 00:11:07.68 sardge, you know, at that point. And he was sort of the same way, but it was your,
00:11:07.68 --> 00:11:11.68 your kind of different level in that regard. And so I was like, hey, how do you,
00:11:11.68 --> 00:11:16.12 what, what would you do there? Whatever. And you were like, well, it's just what
00:11:16.12 --> 00:11:21.76 you saw, you know, side mouth boom, put your arm right there and just choke you.
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:27.32 There's no big revelation. It was like, all right, so I'm like cool,
00:11:27.32 --> 00:11:32.16 really. All right. And I didn't, I didn't get the impression that you like disliked
00:11:32.16 --> 00:11:36.12 me or nothing, which I probably would have if you were anybody else, but I knew that
00:11:36.12 --> 00:11:40.68 you were sort of like that. So whatever, jump, he's like apparently, you know,
00:11:40.68 --> 00:11:45.92 what I thought he was. And then that was sort of it. And I didn't like train with you or
00:11:45.92 --> 00:11:50.72 nothing like that. I, not that I remember anyway. And then, um, so this, this was
00:11:50.72 --> 00:11:56.48 for like 2005, 2006. Check. And I know, yeah, I don't know if you're gone, you know,
00:11:56.48 --> 00:11:59.76 overseas or whatever, I guess you were right. Yeah, well, I went overseas, probably
00:11:59.76 --> 00:12:04.60 after I met you because I deployed it in the summer of 2006, I left in like April
00:12:04.60 --> 00:12:09.40 for a body. Yeah. And then when did you come back and then came back and start
00:12:09.40 --> 00:12:16.04 training and start talking October or November of 2006. Six. Yeah. So the, when I
00:12:16.04 --> 00:12:23.12 remit the first like early memory of actually like seeing you again after that was,
00:12:23.12 --> 00:12:29.56 like well after Purple Belt. So I got purple belt in 2007. And I was like competing
00:12:29.56 --> 00:12:32.68 and stuff. And then you were there. And I was sort of kind of training with you
00:12:32.68 --> 00:12:39.16 whatever, not not that much. But yeah, I remember you being at the competition.
00:12:39.16 --> 00:12:43.16 Yeah. I remember coaching you some years. Yeah. Yeah. And then when you're, when
00:12:43.16 --> 00:12:46.52 you were actually coaching me like on like right before I got injured and stuff,
00:12:46.52 --> 00:12:51.12 like we were training a lot. I was training with you. And then, um, it was funny
00:12:51.12 --> 00:12:54.92 because you're like the same way. And this actually helped me out first. I was like,
00:12:54.92 --> 00:13:00.60 fuck, chocolate doesn't care about me that much, you know. But this is what I
00:13:00.60 --> 00:13:03.88 realized like pretty quick is like, it's not that you don't care about me. It's like
00:13:03.88 --> 00:13:08.96 certain things are not a big deal. Which we all think are a big deal like to
00:13:08.96 --> 00:13:14.36 be you. They're just not a big deal. So like that time when it was the same
00:13:14.36 --> 00:13:19.20 tournament as I hurt my arm the first time. And I got go go plot it. Remember?
00:13:19.20 --> 00:13:22.36 And here's the thing. When I was like when I was competing before that, like I
00:13:22.36 --> 00:13:27.20 never, ever since I went because you, okay. So no geek, it's not by belt. Back
00:13:27.20 --> 00:13:31.40 then it was not by belt. It was like, uh, if it was a big tournament, it was a
00:13:31.40 --> 00:13:35.88 novice beginner intermediate advance. That's how it went. And then if it's a
00:13:35.88 --> 00:13:40.88 smaller tournament, there's just beginner intermediate advance. So the when I
00:13:40.88 --> 00:13:45.04 started competing in advanced, like that's when I was sort of training with you.
00:13:45.04 --> 00:13:48.44 And at that point, like I was doing really good. I was training like a lot
00:13:48.44 --> 00:13:52.68 a lot, and I never, and I never lost. Never lost. I'll be until that day, right?
00:13:52.68 --> 00:13:57.84 That I hurt myself. So like a few matches before I hurt myself, I didn't get
00:13:57.84 --> 00:14:02.40 to say the genre Roberts by the way. So you know what genre Roberts is? He's
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:04.96 like he ended up being a famous Gigi. You know? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
00:14:04.96 --> 00:14:09.48 genre Roberts. That's how it's got it. So he, uh, I go against him and he
00:14:09.48 --> 00:14:16.60 go, he finishes me with a go go plot. Right. What's there? Yeah, my family's there.
00:14:16.60 --> 00:14:19.88 Everything, you know, they kind of expected me to win. Yeah, because it's a
00:14:19.88 --> 00:14:24.40 champion. Yeah, go. Champion of the family. Just got, and they can't tell
00:14:24.40 --> 00:14:28.64 what that was. Yeah. It's going to bother to is like a, I'm not going to say
00:14:28.64 --> 00:14:33.64 it's a, it's a, it's a move of humiliation to have done to you. But there is a
00:14:33.64 --> 00:14:41.44 level of it's a highlight on the humiliation scale. It's not in the middle.
00:14:41.44 --> 00:14:44.80 It's leaning towards the humiliating. Yeah, yeah, yeah, because there's a lot of
00:14:44.80 --> 00:14:49.24 things that have to happen. And yeah, well, you said a go go plot, right? Go go
00:14:49.24 --> 00:14:54.52 go. Yeah. So I would say this to evaluate a go go plot to if it's done to you.
00:14:54.52 --> 00:14:58.52 You were the, the, the, the, the, the buddy and of a highlight. Yeah, you are like
00:14:58.52 --> 00:15:02.44 pretty much under all circumstances. You know, once a, so, and meanwhile, genre
00:15:02.44 --> 00:15:07.04 orbretzes, a thinner, like more thin guy. So when we, when we face off, it's like,
00:15:07.04 --> 00:15:11.68 Oh, this guy's going to get smashed and Sean, oh, man. Yeah, and he told me
00:15:11.68 --> 00:15:16.12 got me with it. Like, probably textbook, like, it was, there was at no point in
00:15:16.12 --> 00:15:19.68 that match that I was like, get, you know, or nothing. He ran through me and, and
00:15:19.68 --> 00:15:24.44 tapped me out. Right. And then, so I'm like, Devastie, never lost in advanced
00:15:24.44 --> 00:15:27.60 competition. I'm like Devastie, my, you know, my family's there, whatever, my wife's
00:15:27.60 --> 00:15:30.52 like, well, we weren't married at the time, but she's like, oh, like, oh, man,
00:15:30.52 --> 00:15:33.64 are you like, okay, like, worried about how I'd handle it, but so I'm like, whatever.
00:15:33.64 --> 00:15:37.000 Like, I wasn't that like broken up about it, but it was something. It was like,
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.44 alusha. And then, you're like across the arena, whatever, later, and he
00:15:42.44 --> 00:15:46.52 texts me, he goes, oh, you got caught with the go go. That's got a sting.
00:15:46.52 --> 00:15:53.96 Like, bro, my coach, my coach telling me this, you know, not like, hey,
00:15:53.96 --> 00:16:02.44 shake it off, you know, like, get back in there, nothing like that. What's strangely,
00:16:02.44 --> 00:16:06.20 that made me feel so much better when you did it, like, when you said that, you know,
00:16:06.20 --> 00:16:09.48 because I was like, man, it's a lot of big deal, man. There's not a bit, you know,
00:16:09.48 --> 00:16:13.80 like, we're in this arena, you know, it's like, we're in a Jiu-Jitsu, everyone's competing,
00:16:13.80 --> 00:16:17.32 and it's like, you know, it's so not a big deal at the end of the day, but it
00:16:17.32 --> 00:16:20.60 feels like a huge deal, you know. So I want to, I got to church, I was like, I mean,
00:16:20.60 --> 00:16:24.20 well, I see you across the thing, like on your phone or at our town, like, oh, this guy,
00:16:24.60 --> 00:16:31.40 but I'm like, whatever. So, um, yeah, that was kind of like how the whole deal was. I ended up
00:16:31.40 --> 00:16:38.60 getting hurt, my first by step, yeah, or whatever, and so I was out for a little bit, but yeah,
00:16:38.60 --> 00:16:42.60 when I came back, we'd train somewhere, too. But before you told your by step, because there
00:16:42.60 --> 00:16:47.16 was a time period where we were training hard all the time. That was this time period, right? Yes,
00:16:47.16 --> 00:16:53.24 yeah. Like, I always need an alternate training partner for Dean, because Dean's traveling or
00:16:53.24 --> 00:16:57.80 Dean's hurt or whatever, and as always, I have someone else, and it's some up and come or that's
00:16:57.80 --> 00:17:04.28 hungry that doesn't mind training hard and wants to train a lot. So, you know, you, and then Andy
00:17:04.28 --> 00:17:08.52 after Andy's who it is right now. Andy was way after though. Oh, yeah, Andy's way after,
00:17:08.52 --> 00:17:12.20 but I'm just saying like, at that time, you were training with me. Like, I remember we were,
00:17:12.20 --> 00:17:16.60 we'd go to other mats, we would train, you know, other mats in our gym, be like, oh, they're,
00:17:16.60 --> 00:17:20.20 they're just over there. Let's get there's more room. We'll go over here. Yeah. I remember actually
00:17:20.20 --> 00:17:28.20 when victory first, it was called throw down in heat, and we went, um, it wasn't even done yet.
00:17:28.20 --> 00:17:31.96 Yeah, we were in Australia. We were like, hey, let's go downstairs. Like, no one had ever touched
00:17:31.96 --> 00:17:35.64 these mats before. And that, and we rolled it whatever, and the mats were still like,
00:17:35.64 --> 00:17:40.04 weird slippery, because they still had the little, you know, layers of the mattress. The fact
00:17:40.04 --> 00:17:46.60 you're new, you son of a sudden. Yeah. And, you know, whatever, but I remember that's when you were like,
00:17:47.40 --> 00:17:51.000 you were saying, you know what a good feat. I forget your exact words, but it was like this,
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.24 you know what what feeling is really, really good to have your own gym to train at. And every
00:17:57.24 --> 00:18:03.64 you want. I was like, I, I remember that specifically, but yes, yeah, that was, um, yeah, that was
00:18:03.64 --> 00:18:10.76 when I was competing. And yeah, training as much as possible. So, uh, then you hurt your arm, whatever.
00:18:10.76 --> 00:18:15.48 And then what, at what point did you start, because at this point, you were a bouncer,
00:18:16.12 --> 00:18:22.12 whatever, um, what point did you start making videos? Because it was pretty early on that you
00:18:22.12 --> 00:18:30.92 used decided that you were going to become a videoographer, make makeer, something. Uh, yeah. So we,
00:18:30.92 --> 00:18:36.52 I stopped being a bouncer and I started getting to web with my brother from scratch. I didn't know
00:18:36.52 --> 00:18:42.36 anything. So it's, you know, it's kind of like multimedia, you know, web development graphic design,
00:18:42.36 --> 00:18:46.68 that kind of stuff. I always was sort of into that in one where another's growing up. So it's a little
00:18:46.68 --> 00:18:53.80 kid where me and Jade, my brother were kind of standouts in that regard, like drawing. And in fact,
00:18:53.80 --> 00:18:58.20 I remember one time, Jade, he was in in sixth grade. We did, you know, how that you said poster
00:18:58.20 --> 00:19:02.44 contests. Yeah, I'm sure they still have it in some of them. Yeah, I'm sure they do. But you basically
00:19:02.44 --> 00:19:10.44 they give you a theme and then you call you draw in color up big poster. That, that's, you know,
00:19:10.44 --> 00:19:15.88 that follows that theme and Jade ended up winning it a national. Like, it goes by,
00:19:15.88 --> 00:19:21.08 up so you win and it's like, yeah, apparently it was about a drunk, a drunk driving, mad,
00:19:21.08 --> 00:19:27.24 these against drum driving. So, you know, you win this school. It was actually kind of dope. It was a
00:19:28.60 --> 00:19:35.08 car for the time. This is like, you know, sick literally six grade. A car crashing into a big can of
00:19:35.08 --> 00:19:40.68 beer. That was it. But the way he did it was good. You know, we're real good at drawing to at that time.
00:19:40.68 --> 00:19:46.28 So he wins the school. He wins the island of Koi that and then it wins like the state,
00:19:46.28 --> 00:19:50.92 you know, then all the winners of the state go into the national, which wins any freaking wins it.
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:58.68 $1,000. Dang. So there's a lot of money. Oh yeah, trip to like New York and like all this stuff.
00:19:58.68 --> 00:20:03.72 So it was kind of a big deal just for a drive. So anyway, the point is like we, we, we, we were always
00:20:03.72 --> 00:20:10.04 into artistic and drawing stuff. So web design and graphic design was kind of like, okay, that was good.
00:20:10.04 --> 00:20:17.80 And then kind of through that, I don't know. So you know the ideal, you watch a movie, right?
00:20:17.80 --> 00:20:21.64 Or a movie is going to come out and you watch the trailer. Yeah. You're like dang. The trip.
00:20:21.64 --> 00:20:25.48 Look, it can't wait to watch that movie. Then you watch the movie and you're like, okay, cool,
00:20:25.48 --> 00:20:30.20 good movie, but man, the trailer was like way better. You know, got me way more fired up than like the
00:20:30.20 --> 00:20:35.40 movie, the movie, kind of was a laptop. So that whole idea that whole phenomenon like a really was interested
00:20:35.40 --> 00:20:40.52 in where like who made that trailer where he got the movie and chopped it up and got the cool
00:20:40.52 --> 00:20:45.000 parts and told almost like a little alternate story, you know. Like and not necessarily alternate,
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000 but remember what was it a specific trailer that came up, what was it? A bunch of them. So
00:20:50.04 --> 00:20:55.64 one of the ones that I always watch was Terminator Salvation and it has the I think,
00:20:55.64 --> 00:21:00.68 whenever you say a movie and then you give me this look of your waiting for me to give you a nod of like,
00:21:00.68 --> 00:21:06.36 oh yeah, I know that. I'm just giving you a straight register because I've seen Terminator 1 and 2.
00:21:06.36 --> 00:21:10.36 Yeah. And I don't know what's comes after that, but I'm apparently Salvation is known. Yeah,
00:21:10.36 --> 00:21:17.80 one of them. So Terminator 1, which, okay. So Terminator 1, Terminator 2, or the best, by far,
00:21:17.80 --> 00:21:26.04 like I'm pretty much factually the best one. Pretty much, it's not very much out for DB. But that's
00:21:26.04 --> 00:21:30.60 back in the day before trailers really kind of hit their stride as far as movie trailers go. So
00:21:31.24 --> 00:21:36.12 and there's Terminator 3 which is completely flopped by the way. Side note. So anyway, Terminator
00:21:36.12 --> 00:21:42.92 Forest Terminator Salvation, Christian Bale was in no one. Anyway, the trailer was like really well done
00:21:42.92 --> 00:21:48.44 in my opinion. And it had, I forget the group. I'm just trying to blank, but I think it might have been like
00:21:48.44 --> 00:21:52.84 nine inch nails or something like that where they did, they had the song called The Day, the whole world went away
00:21:52.84 --> 00:21:57.72 and built a day, you know, you know, into saying it for us, but we'll take the word for it. Anyway,
00:21:57.72 --> 00:22:04.60 they use that song in the trailer and then the way they did it, I was like, man, this is like,
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:10.68 I want to live my life like this trailer feels or whatever. As far as like, you know, the videos I
00:22:10.68 --> 00:22:15.80 want to make. So there was that, there was like, Clash of the Titans, that was a good one, I thought,
00:22:16.52 --> 00:22:20.60 yeah, there's a bunch. Okay, so then you decided you're going to start making trailers.
00:22:20.60 --> 00:22:25.32 What was the first video that you got paid to make? But I got paid to make. Yes.
00:22:25.32 --> 00:22:33.000 Was with you, bro? And what was it? Was it throwdown or did we victory? Nope, not even that. Was it before that?
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.44 Well, was it? So the first video I made ever was like on a cruise like, you know, now you can see him anywhere.
00:22:38.44 --> 00:22:41.96 Like you, you know, you basically take your camera and do the keys, chop it up, put it with music. But the first
00:22:42.84 --> 00:22:49.88 video that I made from money was with you for like some people. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I made like a
00:22:50.60 --> 00:22:54.92 thing about the laws of combat. You filmed being sat there and talked about it. And then they
00:22:54.92 --> 00:23:00.60 instituted inside their organization for 18 months or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one that
00:23:00.60 --> 00:23:11.48 the sound was off. So the movie is not funny. Obviously, T's. So, so just let me fill in the listeners.
00:23:12.52 --> 00:23:17.16 This is like a probably a one hour video. Maybe maybe I don't know. 45 minute video.
00:23:17.72 --> 00:23:23.000 Yeah, yeah, it's a 45 minute video. I'm talking. I'm explaining the laws of combat. I'm talking about
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.84 extreme ownership. I'm going through these things to the screen and the the audio is off by a half a
00:23:32.84 --> 00:23:39.80 second. So it looks like a weird old Chinese martial arts film with the voice double over.
00:23:40.36 --> 00:23:45.80 And so I say to echo, you know, like, hey, it seems like, you know, it seems like my voice doesn't match
00:23:45.80 --> 00:23:52.36 my mouth. And I'm saying it sort of as a question, but like term the first two terminators being
00:23:52.36 --> 00:23:58.76 the factually, this was a factual situation. Who was no debating? I was watching my lips move with no words
00:23:58.76 --> 00:24:04.84 coming out. And I'm like, this is not good. And you, you pushed back on me actually. That's what's really funny.
00:24:04.84 --> 00:24:09.48 That's that actually may be suspect of your whole existence. So your whole, because you were like,
00:24:09.48 --> 00:24:14.60 you would try and explain to me that that was somehow like your first one, you're telling me like,
00:24:14.60 --> 00:24:18.84 no, no, not really. I might watch the lips move. See how there's no words coming out?
00:24:18.84 --> 00:24:22.92 Wait, was that the time where you came over and we were watching it or where you texting me?
00:24:22.92 --> 00:24:27.000 I think if you came, I started off texting you like, hey, can you sync these things? And your response is
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.92 we're like, well, it's not really that often. I'm like, what are you talking about? And so that I
00:24:30.92 --> 00:24:36.20 probably came to your house with a pistol and was like, okay, we're going to fix this. But
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.12 you had a serious, there was a problem. So this is this is what how and how did you think that was okay?
00:24:44.12 --> 00:24:49.32 Okay, this is, okay, so this is three little elements to this whole equation that'll make it make sense.
00:24:49.32 --> 00:24:56.52 Okay, so, okay, so first off, I wasn't necessarily acting like this and I'm not saying I was trying
00:24:56.52 --> 00:25:00.12 to give the impression that I knew exactly what I was doing because come on, let's face, this is
00:25:00.12 --> 00:25:06.12 literally my first video that I've ever made that anyone's actually depending on me, right? So I'm like,
00:25:06.12 --> 00:25:10.52 all right, so yeah, I syncoped the audio, whatever, and I don't know how to syncop audio. No idea.
00:25:10.52 --> 00:25:17.16 So I'm just swinging it. So I syncoped the audio, what I thought was like synced up.
00:25:17.16 --> 00:25:20.12 Yeah. And so I'm going to take a half a second to get to.
00:25:22.44 --> 00:25:27.96 So editing it and just like I said, but I'm used the video, the one or two videos that I've ever made
00:25:27.96 --> 00:25:33.64 was like two minutes long. So editing a two minute video is like, okay, click, click, click,
00:25:33.64 --> 00:25:39.72 you edit it, but man, 45 minutes of editing your brain just a kind, you know, like, so he'll be
00:25:39.72 --> 00:25:43.80 off sync by a lot and your brain will kind of connect the dots. It's weird. Like, you ever watch a
00:25:43.80 --> 00:25:50.84 move, uh, no, I get it. Yeah. So my brain essentially connected it and was interpreting it as sunk up.
00:25:52.52 --> 00:25:56.84 So you're over here saying, hey, it's off sync. Look at this and I'm like, look at that, I'm looking at it.
00:25:56.84 --> 00:26:01.64 And then I'm doing all these weird mental experiments like to be like, okay, let me pause it right
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:07.24 when he said, and it's all checking out in my brain. I get it. And that's what I was like,
00:26:07.24 --> 00:26:13.08 no, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong. So finally you're like, bro, I'm like, I'm coming over
00:26:13.08 --> 00:26:17.88 and we're gonna get to the bottom of this. So I'm like, yeah, come, whatever. So you come and we're doing it.
00:26:17.88 --> 00:26:21.56 And you're like, me and you're just seeing two different things at this point. Because my brain is all
00:26:21.56 --> 00:26:25.000 wack to all jammed up. Because I remember like, we were, I was trying to meet it. We were trying to
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.52 meet a deadline too. That's a thing. So I'll stain up like super late and I get much sleep. So
00:26:29.48 --> 00:26:34.12 so you come over, we're looking at it. We're seeing two different things until this one little part
00:26:34.12 --> 00:26:39.48 where you're like, you clapped. You did this. Yes. And then it was like, oh my gosh. So it's real
00:26:39.48 --> 00:26:44.12 clear when you clap and then the sound comes later. And you're like, yeah, look at that. And I'm like,
00:26:44.12 --> 00:26:48.76 it all came crashing down like, man, I'm completely wrong. But that was good because I could be like,
00:26:48.76 --> 00:26:54.28 okay, now I'm gonna sink the whole 45 minutes off of this one thing. You're saying, so that's, that's
00:26:54.28 --> 00:26:58.44 what happened there. Okay. So that was your first video near failure. Here's the thing about that
00:26:58.44 --> 00:27:03.08 first video too. That was like the beginning of Eshenalon front, essentially. Yeah, that was.
00:27:03.08 --> 00:27:07.56 Because when you think, okay, so I revisited that video like last year, just going through what year was that?
00:27:07.56 --> 00:27:14.52 You have to remember? I got 2010. Yeah. Yeah. So Eshenalon front wasn't officially formed yet.
00:27:14.52 --> 00:27:20.36 I think that was like right after your return. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man, I looked at it so a year ago. I
00:27:20.36 --> 00:27:24.36 looked at bring up the video, looking over hard drives or whatever. I'd bring it up on, let me check this out.
00:27:24.36 --> 00:27:29.96 You're all young. So funny. So like you're all young looking and you're saying all Eshenalon front
00:27:29.96 --> 00:27:34.60 stuff. But super like early beginnings of it. Yeah. Some say, and I was like, comments,
00:27:34.60 --> 00:27:40.12 really interesting to watch. Now that like I know like all the content to whatever. It's funny. But yeah,
00:27:40.12 --> 00:27:48.92 that's what it was. Eshenalon front 1.0. Yes. That is it right out there. First one. And the second video
00:27:48.92 --> 00:27:53.56 was with you as well. That was the victory. The throw down was the victory. Yeah, it was victory.
00:27:53.56 --> 00:27:59.80 That was victory. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And which video was it? The outtakes from some of those videos
00:27:59.80 --> 00:28:04.04 are awesome. Yeah. Those those later on. It was just like there's one where the investors like
00:28:04.04 --> 00:28:10.12 monkeys giraffe squirrels. Yeah. That's how it cracks me. Yeah. But that I think that those the victory
00:28:10.12 --> 00:28:15.72 ones, that's how like people started to know around like here around 10 years ago that I did video
00:28:15.72 --> 00:28:22.36 because I did a series of them and that just kind of, we're like, I just tried to make them like
00:28:22.36 --> 00:28:26.76 kind of like move you trailer kind of dramatic and no one at that time was doing anything like that
00:28:26.76 --> 00:28:32.44 as far as like making videos for companies or whatever. And so you look at them now and they're like
00:28:32.44 --> 00:28:37.72 they're pretty cheesy. Now. But back then it's kind of like, oh dang you know. Yeah, no, those were like
00:28:37.72 --> 00:28:43.88 those were really good videos for that time period. Yeah. And I sort of put my name on them.
00:28:44.52 --> 00:28:48.28 Not sort of straight up put my name on them. You know, when I'd upload them whatever. And that's
00:28:48.28 --> 00:28:51.96 how people are like, oh, you're actually the one that does those videos. Like that, you know,
00:28:51.96 --> 00:28:58.84 I guess, my name's kind of distinct or whatever. So that's how I kind of kind of gained like some people
00:28:58.84 --> 00:29:04.04 started knowing some fame. Not not not fame. But people started knowing I made a name record.
00:29:04.04 --> 00:29:09.24 Yeah. It's for the end. Okay. So now there's a chunk of time now we're talking because
00:29:09.24 --> 00:29:15.40 we didn't start this podcast until 2015. And these are easy dates for me to remember because
00:29:15.40 --> 00:29:20.20 extreme ownership came out in October of 2015. But I was on Tim Ferriss podcast.
00:29:20.20 --> 00:29:32.20 That came out like September 25th, 2015. And then I was on a rogan like December 8th or something
00:29:32.92 --> 00:29:40.76 2015. And then we started this two weeks later. This podcast, I remember I was like, let's get it
00:29:40.76 --> 00:29:45.40 out before Christmas. And we did. We got out like 20 second of December or something like that.
00:29:45.40 --> 00:29:52.76 So there's five years between, okay, you made the first echelon front one point of video
00:29:54.04 --> 00:29:58.36 between that time period and 2015. What were you doing? Okay. So you were making other videos.
00:29:58.92 --> 00:30:03.88 You had some, but you actually had some pretty big, pretty big videos, right? You did,
00:30:04.84 --> 00:30:11.16 well, let's just start with the ha not show. Right? So the ha not show. Yeah. So you will,
00:30:11.16 --> 00:30:17.16 before like after the victory, that was started this cascade of like other people wanting me to do
00:30:17.16 --> 00:30:24.20 that. Those were good videos. So which was perfect because I kind of got thrown into the mix,
00:30:24.20 --> 00:30:28.76 like, and had to like, you had to learn. Yeah. Like hard. Like there's no better way to learn than
00:30:28.76 --> 00:30:33.88 getting thrown in the, well, there are better ways. But that's a way, that's a way you're going to
00:30:33.88 --> 00:30:37.24 have to learn. Yeah. You get a sink or swim and you started swimming, crawl stroke,
00:30:37.24 --> 00:30:43.80 oh yeah. Restro, side stroke. Yeah. And like mistakes, you make like you really learn the lesson
00:30:43.80 --> 00:30:47.56 because it's not like, oh, I made the mistake in my freaking, what was your next bit after the
00:30:47.56 --> 00:30:55.08 war is the next like big break after victory? Um, I, a big one. I worked for a guy Blake Malin
00:30:55.64 --> 00:30:59.64 and that was like, as far as content goes, it was like, okay, it was kind of, you know,
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:04.04 corporate and stuff like that, compared to the stuff I do know. When you would make early,
00:31:04.04 --> 00:31:07.80 which, what is what I noticed when you make, or when those early videos that I was in,
00:31:08.36 --> 00:31:12.92 when I watch them, I'm like, this is the same thing we're doing right now almost. Like the same,
00:31:12.92 --> 00:31:17.72 especially you see the, well, like you said, like the thing that the things I'm saying that
00:31:17.72 --> 00:31:21.88 was like, oh, yeah, we, if we would have known then we just say, okay, let's just start making more of
00:31:21.88 --> 00:31:26.20 those right now. And really when you think about the whole thing as a big picture, it's, that's
00:31:26.20 --> 00:31:30.04 literally what happened. So like when you, like when we're making the victory videos, right,
00:31:30.04 --> 00:31:34.76 there's so many outtakes like, and most of them are me and you because you're messing with me the way,
00:31:34.76 --> 00:31:39.000 always messing with me like you're like, there's this one where you're like, because okay, and you,
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.56 you, you, you're kind of smart you, like you, and I don't mean smart like you're observant.
00:31:45.56 --> 00:31:52.92 No more observant than the normal person. So I'm new to video and I figured out really early when I
00:31:52.92 --> 00:31:56.92 do shoots with people, I just press record because a lot of the good stuff you can get with
00:31:56.92 --> 00:32:00.68 people is when they don't know you're recording. When I'm talking to them directing them, um,
00:32:00.68 --> 00:32:03.96 they're doing something else. They say something. They're trying to at least loosen up and they're
00:32:03.96 --> 00:32:08.92 doing whatever. And there's a lot of good stuff coming from there. And you picked up on that pretty
00:32:08.92 --> 00:32:13.80 quick and you're like, you're recording, aren't you? You know what I'm saying? I saw you pressed a button.
00:32:13.80 --> 00:32:18.84 Oh man, like, but the way you said is like, that's literally the same stuff you do, you know what
00:32:18.84 --> 00:32:25.32 else is funny? You got that one video of our old CrossFit instructor. Yeah. And he said,
00:32:25.32 --> 00:32:31.32 he said, I'm gonna try and summon my inner jacco, which is weird because how did he,
00:32:31.32 --> 00:32:37.56 what had even seen me before? Well, that comes from. Amen. Everybody new, man. That's random.
00:32:37.56 --> 00:32:43.64 Yeah. That was random. But yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I did some, some of that. Then yeah,
00:32:43.64 --> 00:32:47.16 I'm working with Blake because that was, it's like an ongoing thing, which that's what I really
00:32:47.16 --> 00:32:52.04 liked about like doing video or the type of videos I like to do is like ongoing one stuff where I
00:32:52.04 --> 00:32:57.32 could like think of like cool little themes for the next one, you know, kind of think. So I did that
00:32:57.32 --> 00:33:02.52 for a while and then, um, and then I tried to, and then I wanted to make like movies and stuff like I
00:33:02.52 --> 00:33:08.60 think like anyone who does video. You did, uh, you did some martial arts, some grappling stuff, too.
00:33:08.60 --> 00:33:13.32 Those were some pretty good videos. And you're actually traveling to do those videos, which one?
00:33:13.32 --> 00:33:16.60 Like Metamores. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did some really cool
00:33:16.60 --> 00:33:22.60 Metamores videos. They were kind of, uh, prefight. Right. Yeah. Like kind of like a hype down.
00:33:22.60 --> 00:33:27.88 Yeah. It's countdown type videos 30 for 30 or whatever. Yeah. Kind of like little mini
00:33:27.88 --> 00:33:31.96 document. Yeah. It's like about the person in the fight coming up. Yeah. Yeah. And that actually
00:33:31.96 --> 00:33:38.52 doing those a lot. That's how I met a lot of the big due to players and how even more how that
00:33:38.52 --> 00:33:42.68 spread like through the due to community outside of San Diego. Like, okay, that guy makes like videos
00:33:42.68 --> 00:33:49.96 or whatever. So I did that. And at the same time, I met Resson who is Hennato Laranja, I met him.
00:33:49.96 --> 00:33:55.64 And I was like, brother, this guy needs like a show. So we made a show with him. And we got
00:33:55.64 --> 00:34:03.56 episodes. I think six six altogether. Those are hilarious. Oh, yeah. Those are epic. Yeah. And
00:34:03.56 --> 00:34:10.60 those are on Flexpoint TV. Well, they're on YouTube. Yeah. But I wear on YouTube. Oh, just just go
00:34:10.60 --> 00:34:16.36 and not to learn on just show. Or yeah, Flexpoint.tv. They're on there. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. But we had
00:34:16.36 --> 00:34:23.08 that how that's a hard one to that was hard to make given where I was in my career. We'll say
00:34:23.08 --> 00:34:29.16 because it's like, okay, I can do if I was just doing that full time, which I kind of was at a
00:34:29.16 --> 00:34:33.08 little pocket. I was just doing that full time. You could do it. But because consider what you got to
00:34:33.08 --> 00:34:38.84 do as just, you know, I don't have this huge production studio with people like arranging everything.
00:34:38.84 --> 00:34:43.72 So we got to basically arrange my schedule because I still got to work and stuff. Like, I was
00:34:43.72 --> 00:34:47.80 we were mean. Jade, we're putting money into it. We were spending money to produce this show.
00:34:48.44 --> 00:34:53.40 So there's that. And then there's, I got to work. Right. I have other stuff to do. So I got to
00:34:53.40 --> 00:34:59.88 schedule with myself. And we filmed an LA with two hours away. Where'd you what space did you use?
00:34:59.88 --> 00:35:04.12 It's called the Dream Factory LA. Some place that you were paying to use that you rent out the studio.
00:35:04.12 --> 00:35:07.64 Yeah. It's a little set there. It was pretty dope though. It was really cool.
00:35:07.64 --> 00:35:12.84 And then so my schedule, the Dream Factory schedule, which it wasn't too bad because, you know,
00:35:12.84 --> 00:35:16.68 you can schedule it in advance or whatever, but not those schedule. And then the select,
00:35:16.68 --> 00:35:20.92 because the guests are celebrity types, bass, rude, dine, Frank Shamrock, like, Hannah,
00:35:20.92 --> 00:35:25.000 like all these. So you got to schedule with them as well. Like Kenny Florian was the first one.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.88 But that was really fun show. But it was really hard to get together and put on.
00:35:29.88 --> 00:35:36.20 Yeah. So when I had a career and then towards the end of us filming that, my career started
00:35:36.20 --> 00:35:41.64 to go up and up even more. So it's like, man, I can't do it. I just couldn't do it. We couldn't do it.
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:47.48 So yeah. So it stopped. But that's a funny one. All of everyone's all like watching again.
00:35:47.48 --> 00:35:53.72 And it's freaking funny. Yeah. Oh, he's a hilarious guy. It was a, it's a good show, great show.
00:35:54.52 --> 00:36:00.52 And then meanwhile, you and I are still training hard. I mean, we're training hard this whole time.
00:36:00.52 --> 00:36:06.44 You were one of my primary training partners this entire time. Yeah. And then,
00:36:07.96 --> 00:36:15.24 at like I just kind of told part of the story, but I go on 10 Ferris' podcast and he tells me to
00:36:15.24 --> 00:36:21.72 start a podcast. And you reminded me of this. We actually had talked about it in a little bit.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.44 Wait, were you trying to convince me to do one? Yeah. So you told me that we should do a podcast
00:36:28.44 --> 00:36:34.76 that you could figure it out or whatever. Yeah. And then I was on Rogan. And that's why at the end of
00:36:34.76 --> 00:36:40.12 the first time I was on Rogan Show, I said echo, get it, get ready. Because in the middle of Rogan
00:36:40.12 --> 00:36:44.84 Show, he says, you should have podcast, which come to find out Joe Rogan tells everybody that.
00:36:44.84 --> 00:36:51.88 Yeah. Everyone who should have one. Oh, yeah. And, but I listened, thankfully. And it was, you know,
00:36:51.88 --> 00:36:58.92 bit both here in it from Tim and Joe was was was a convincing. And I mean, I would have done it just
00:36:58.92 --> 00:37:04.44 off of Tim, but the book, it was like I was on Tim, then the book came out, then I was doing that thing
00:37:05.48 --> 00:37:11.40 and just barely got done doing kind of the book promotions in New York City when I came home.
00:37:11.40 --> 00:37:16.28 And that's when Rogan. So it all happened pretty quick, but yeah, having both of those guys said.
00:37:16.28 --> 00:37:23.000 So then, but I do remember this conversation to for sure. I came back from Rogan and I said,
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.08 hey, we're going to do a podcast. Are you good? You know, can, can you make it? Can you make it?
00:37:30.28 --> 00:37:34.44 And you said, I'll tell you tomorrow because I remember you specifically said, I'll tell you tomorrow.
00:37:34.44 --> 00:37:38.68 You could, you didn't have an answer for me right then. The next day, you come into training. I come into
00:37:38.68 --> 00:37:44.12 training and you said, hey, I know I can do the podcast. I figured it all out. I know what I got to do.
00:37:44.12 --> 00:37:53.40 And then you said, let me be on it, too. And I said, what are you going to do? And you said,
00:37:54.52 --> 00:37:59.000 I'll be normal and you be you. And I thought that was a pretty good idea.
00:38:00.28 --> 00:38:07.40 And plus, more important, I didn't want to sit and talk to myself. I'd rather talk to you.
00:38:08.12 --> 00:38:13.32 And because you and I would talk on the mat anyways, and oftentimes we're talking about subjects that
00:38:13.32 --> 00:38:19.56 we would, that we're interested in. So why not be able to sit there and talk to someone and
00:38:20.12 --> 00:38:25.80 you're a super humble guy. I was like, yeah, I could, you know, we hang out all the time. So if there's
00:38:25.80 --> 00:38:33.000 one person that I can see that can sit there and listen and not feel like, hey, I'm going to throw my
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.44 two cents in on every. It's like, okay, cool. Like, let's do this. So that's how we ended up doing this.
00:38:40.44 --> 00:38:48.04 Yeah. Yeah. And the, yeah, the timeline little, okay. So you, and just from my perspective,
00:38:48.04 --> 00:38:52.20 I remember very clearly, too, by the way. When you were on Tim for like, okay, so most of the
00:38:52.20 --> 00:38:56.12 listening to me on Tim first. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Right when he came out, those good. Even
00:38:56.12 --> 00:39:00.52 and I knew you for a long time, but that was a really good. That was a really good podcast. Tim was
00:39:01.88 --> 00:39:07.96 think about Tim. Tim, I mean, you think about the caliber of people that Tim Ferris has on his podcast.
00:39:07.96 --> 00:39:15.32 Mm-hmm. And it was my buddy Kirk Parsley who introduced me to Peter Atia with the purpose,
00:39:15.32 --> 00:39:22.52 like, Kirk was trying to, trying to hook me up and Peter, when I talked to Peter, who I'm now,
00:39:22.52 --> 00:39:25.80 you know, good friends with Peter too, but you know, it was the same thing. Like, they're trying
00:39:25.80 --> 00:39:33.80 to decipher if I would be a person that would be interesting. Right. To listen to. So, so
00:39:33.80 --> 00:39:40.20 awesome, you know, like I said, Kirk hooked me up with Peter, Peter called Tim and said,
00:39:40.20 --> 00:39:46.20 you should have this guy on your podcast. And that was the first first interview I ever did.
00:39:46.20 --> 00:39:54.04 No, that's good. In my life. Yeah. Sitting in Tim Ferris's house in the San Francisco Bay,
00:39:54.04 --> 00:40:00.20 or what he doesn't own anymore, because he moved to Austin, Texas, but just that, like I went
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:05.48 up there on a, I flew up there. That was a good call, because he said, we can do it over remote.
00:40:05.48 --> 00:40:11.32 And I said, no, I'll come up, you know, because I, I want communicating over the phone and
00:40:11.32 --> 00:40:15.08 there's gaps and there's pauses, you can't see the person. So thankfully, I went up there.
00:40:15.64 --> 00:40:18.92 And, you know, Matt, we actually stayed the night. There's, there's awesome, man.
00:40:18.92 --> 00:40:24.52 Tim's just was super cool. And then, so that podcast happened. So you listen to that one?
00:40:24.52 --> 00:40:28.36 Oh, yeah. That's interesting that you sort of figured that that communication thing,
00:40:28.36 --> 00:40:32.76 because that's a huge deal. Like if you can go, if you have the option to go in person or
00:40:32.76 --> 00:40:37.32 over Skype, of course, you're going to choose in person, that kind of seems obvious, but
00:40:38.12 --> 00:40:43.08 I feel like people don't understand how much of a difference that that makes. Like, it's
00:40:43.08 --> 00:40:49.40 night and day. It's a night and day situation. I was working for the Admiral in charge of all the
00:40:49.40 --> 00:40:59.72 seals. And there was a meeting happening in DC, like at the Pentagon. And the Admiral had a small,
00:41:00.60 --> 00:41:06.60 a small decision was being made. And he had an opinion on it. And someone else had another
00:41:06.60 --> 00:41:10.76 opinion on it. And he talked to the guy that was making the decision. It was like, hey, you know,
00:41:11.48 --> 00:41:15.64 do you want me to come out here for this meeting? And the guy's like, well, you don't have to.
00:41:15.64 --> 00:41:20.76 And the Admiral's like, okay, cool. Because for the Admiral and I, you know, I meant us getting on
00:41:20.76 --> 00:41:25.32 of, you know, on a flight, flying six hours, not like we have a jet. Like we're going to get on a
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:28.68 commercial flight. We're going to stay the night and some random hotel, blah, blah, blah. So he goes,
00:41:28.68 --> 00:41:33.56 okay, well, you understand my perspective boss sounds good. If you don't need me out there,
00:41:33.56 --> 00:41:39.56 I won't come. So we did a bit, it was a video teleconference. And I'm sitting in there and the decision
00:41:39.56 --> 00:41:46.28 goes the other way. And the Admiral goes, he soon as we got off, he looked at me and he said, I should
00:41:46.28 --> 00:41:55.08 go into that meeting. Yeah. And I was like Roger that boss. You, you face to face is a big deal,
00:41:55.64 --> 00:42:00.60 especially if there's no relationship established. If you don't have a relationship with someone,
00:42:00.60 --> 00:42:05.88 you need to go build it and you build it as much as you possibly can face to face. Yeah. And
00:42:05.88 --> 00:42:11.16 there's a lot of, I mean, there's a lot of over obvious stuff, you know, to figure that. When you
00:42:11.16 --> 00:42:15.08 figure that, it's like, okay, for these obvious reasons or whatever, but not so obvious reasons,
00:42:15.08 --> 00:42:19.88 or just the little teeny tiny almost subconscious subtleties of being there with someone. Even
00:42:19.88 --> 00:42:25.80 like split seconds in a conversation can like, can make a difference between like, if it's like
00:42:25.80 --> 00:42:30.36 cohesive or feels cohesive, for sure. And that's not, and that's of course from person
00:42:30.36 --> 00:42:35.40 but from people listening as well. So like that's why I like, I think that was a good, good move
00:42:35.40 --> 00:42:40.36 for you to just make that, make that sacrifice and go up there and be there with them. Yeah, no,
00:42:40.36 --> 00:42:46.76 it was awesome. And Tim was pretty in the groove at that time. Like he knew how to do it.
00:42:47.96 --> 00:42:54.28 And he, and also the format of his podcast was like, you knew kind of what I kind of knew what
00:42:54.28 --> 00:43:00.76 he was going to ask about. And yet you could veer off and talk about other subjects. So it was
00:43:00.76 --> 00:43:07.16 like a really nice way to kick things off. And now that I've done a bunch of television interviews,
00:43:08.76 --> 00:43:16.36 podcasts are just infinitely more comfortable for me. So some people, they don't want to get
00:43:16.36 --> 00:43:21.16 trapped in some long term conversation. It'd have to remember what they just said and formulate
00:43:21.16 --> 00:43:27.16 thoughts fresh on the spot on the moment. Whereas because the TV people that are doing TV interviews,
00:43:27.72 --> 00:43:32.28 they're not formulating thoughts at that moment. They go into that with a preconceived statement.
00:43:32.28 --> 00:43:36.04 They got four sentences that they're going to say. And that's what they're going to say. It doesn't
00:43:36.04 --> 00:43:40.68 really matter what they get asked. So some people would prefer to do that. Some people would prefer
00:43:40.68 --> 00:43:48.68 to do along. I don't mind doing either, but it's infinitely more fun and thought provoking and
00:43:48.68 --> 00:43:56.44 intellectually stimulating to actually go have a legitimate conversation with, and with with Tim,
00:43:56.44 --> 00:44:02.92 which was awesome. That was a very cool way for me to kick things off. Very lucky. Yeah.
00:44:02.92 --> 00:44:09.56 And me, I was just like probably millions of people who like knew about Joe Rogan,
00:44:09.56 --> 00:44:15.80 listen to Joe Rogan's podcast, which that's kind of like the standard, you know, that top standard
00:44:15.80 --> 00:44:20.28 of podcast. But here's the thing about it. It's like since it's so conversational, where he's like
00:44:20.28 --> 00:44:25.56 just talking in the early days of Joe Rogan's podcast, he would just talk to like red band and like
00:44:25.56 --> 00:44:30.92 his friends and they're just talking about stuff, you know. Now it's like there's a lot more to it,
00:44:30.92 --> 00:44:35.32 for sure. But back then it was like, all these are just guys cruising down in their base
00:44:35.32 --> 00:44:39.96 manner, some cool room that they're just basically what we all sort of do anyway and talk
00:44:39.96 --> 00:44:46.12 shit with each other with friends. And so I think me like millions of other people were like, man,
00:44:46.12 --> 00:44:50.76 that'd be so cool to be able to do that do a podcast like that. You know, just talking with
00:44:50.76 --> 00:44:54.76 my friends or whatever. And then so being in jujitsu, I think that a lot of people were in this
00:44:54.76 --> 00:44:59.96 same boat where they know the guy who like when he's kind of talking to everyone sort of just
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:05.96 listens and likes to chime in and whatever. Right. So like with us in jujitsu was like you and
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:10.20 even Dean when he talked about jujitsu or stories or whatever like they there's a lot of cool
00:45:10.20 --> 00:45:15.96 conversations that go on on the mat after we're before jujitsu, whatever. And those things would always
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:21.000 go on. Those are things we're going on way before it's in the first interview. Right. So before the
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.36 whole podcast idea, we already had I think I was like a lot of people we already had kind of for
00:45:26.36 --> 00:45:31.80 lack of a better way of putting it like dreams of doing some cool podcasts. Like everyone had that thought
00:45:31.80 --> 00:45:35.32 not that we were ever going to pursue it or nothing like that. But the thought like wouldn't that be
00:45:35.32 --> 00:45:41.40 so cool if we could have podcasts like jujitsu and have it be like a good you know successful one.
00:45:41.40 --> 00:45:45.000 A lot of people and you get even nowadays people even when you're only all the time saying like
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.76 oh yeah like I want to start my own podcast on a separate podcast right because it's like when
00:45:48.76 --> 00:45:52.44 you listen to two people talking it's like man that's your job man that's the coolest thing in the world.
00:45:53.08 --> 00:45:58.84 So I already had that in my brain. So when you went on to embarrass ourselves like man when you was like
00:45:58.84 --> 00:46:02.68 you should do a podcast like hell yeah you should do we should do a podcast to me that was like we should
00:46:02.68 --> 00:46:08.76 do a podcast let me say that. So that's actually it was I thought I'm pretty sure it was before Joe
00:46:08.76 --> 00:46:14.60 Rogan I was like hey we should do a podcast and you were like yeah you were like we like why would you
00:46:15.16 --> 00:46:20.20 be on like it doesn't I said you should have me on and you were like why like what and it wasn't like
00:46:20.20 --> 00:46:24.52 it'd be pretty easy for me to be like dang bro like freaking when you got to say like that why would you
00:46:24.52 --> 00:46:28.52 ever be on it but I didn't take like that I don't feel like you're saying it like that you're just
00:46:28.52 --> 00:46:33.08 starting to look Jerry at that question like why why would you be on it yeah they didn't make sense to
00:46:33.08 --> 00:46:40.04 me yeah and I had it in my brain just like I said where bro I'll just be the person you're talking to
00:46:40.60 --> 00:46:45.16 be normal be normal person you know and if I have questions I ask questions like that's not what I'm
00:46:45.16 --> 00:46:49.56 here for I'm here to just you be talking to somebody rather than talking to the microphone or talking
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:54.52 to the screen by yourself or whatever which you know that's fine too but it it's just and so I was
00:46:54.52 --> 00:46:58.52 essentially like thinking of Joe Rogan's podcast where he's like talking to somebody the whole time
00:46:58.52 --> 00:47:02.84 someone's there listening and trying me to never that's what that was my little engineered
00:47:03.88 --> 00:47:09.48 perceived or conceived yeah you know what what I was thinking about I've told you this before when
00:47:09.48 --> 00:47:14.36 it comes to having multiple people on the same podcast like on our podcast we don't have it had
00:47:14.36 --> 00:47:19.96 many episodes where we've had more than one person to interview you know one of the reasons is
00:47:19.96 --> 00:47:25.24 like I already talked about and we already talked about if there's a bunch of people talking I won't
00:47:25.24 --> 00:47:30.92 talk yeah and so what I was thinking myself well when I'm getting interviewed by Tim Ferris he's
00:47:30.92 --> 00:47:35.80 asking me questions okay I answer them because I'm being you know I'm being asked a question
00:47:35.80 --> 00:47:40.36 to an answer it Joe Rogan's asking me questions I'm an answer him but if you put me into a
00:47:40.36 --> 00:47:46.68 situation where there's multiple people and they want to talk I'll just let him talk I'll listen
00:47:46.68 --> 00:47:52.04 so in my mind I was like thinking well if I have someone else on there then I'll just sit there
00:47:52.04 --> 00:47:57.80 and listen to them talk and well if people if Tim Ferris is telling me to have a podcast he's not
00:47:57.80 --> 00:48:01.96 telling me to have a podcast so I can sit there and listen to someone else I should be talking
00:48:01.96 --> 00:48:08.04 okay got it so for me I had to get over the the idea of like oh well and then I thought you
00:48:08.84 --> 00:48:12.84 like I said earlier you're not a person that you know when we're having a normal conversation
00:48:12.84 --> 00:48:15.72 you're not one of these people it's a cold on wait listen to my viewpoint you're a person that
00:48:15.72 --> 00:48:21.16 like oh that's cool interesting you're a you you will listen as much as I will and so that's why
00:48:21.16 --> 00:48:26.84 I thought okay cool yeah make sense good call echo Charles yeah fully and keep in mind too
00:48:26.84 --> 00:48:33.08 yes it was like the a partially myself for sure since like I wanted to be on a podcast for sure
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:38.76 but not at any moment was I being like hey so I can be a star too it was right I didn't have
00:48:38.76 --> 00:48:43.96 that at all like I knew what I was getting into it I knew why I could do it not because I have
00:48:43.96 --> 00:48:47.72 all these cool things to say because I don't really like in my mind like I'm that's not what I'm
00:48:47.72 --> 00:48:52.36 thinking especially compared to you I'm listening to Tim for that interview Tim Fair like
00:48:52.36 --> 00:48:57.40 probably I literally could never bring anything like this to the table but if you're over here
00:48:57.40 --> 00:49:02.52 talking about like stuff stuff and and I have just little detailed questions about that just to
00:49:02.52 --> 00:49:07.32 clarify what you're saying or whatever like I think that I could facilitate in that way and not
00:49:07.32 --> 00:49:11.40 to mention just technically I could make the whole thing happen and I have my own little creative
00:49:11.40 --> 00:49:18.12 ideas as well with that so I'm figure yeah that's it but yeah it never even entered my mind that like
00:49:18.84 --> 00:49:23.48 it's my podcast I'm gonna talk you know you're gonna sort of listen to me sometimes
00:49:23.48 --> 00:49:31.80 so you did have a vision for the podcast at least because the podcast number one I had a vision too
00:49:31.80 --> 00:49:36.84 my vision was basically what the podcast is right now that's what I had the vision of hey
00:49:36.84 --> 00:49:42.36 we're gonna execute this thing like a military operation boom it's gonna and the first podcast
00:49:42.36 --> 00:49:46.76 starts off with your vision which is you know we're kind of talking and then we kind of
00:49:46.76 --> 00:49:53.48 we kind of drift into the beginning of the podcast and then we kind of drift and actually you know
00:49:53.48 --> 00:49:59.40 as you know me and my kind of leadership principles at this time I wasn't 100% sure that I was right
00:49:59.40 --> 00:50:03.72 I just thought to myself this is what it'll be and then you had a different idea and then we didn't
00:50:03.72 --> 00:50:07.08 really talk about it until the next podcast and then I came in and was like because I listened to
00:50:07.08 --> 00:50:10.92 and I was like yeah that's not we shouldn't do it that way in my mind I was like well I don't
00:50:10.92 --> 00:50:15.88 think we should do it that way I think this thing should start and one thing that I wanted it to do was like
00:50:15.88 --> 00:50:22.28 start right when you press plates yeah when you press I wanted people when they put their headphones
00:50:22.28 --> 00:50:30.12 on and press play they were like okay here it comes and that means no intro music that means no
00:50:30.12 --> 00:50:35.96 advertisements rolling in it's like hey this is Jockel podcast number four here we go rock and roll
00:50:36.60 --> 00:50:44.76 and so that's what we started doing one podcast number two yeah what's funny is like that
00:50:44.76 --> 00:50:49.96 so there's two kind of thoughts and I didn't think it out fully but I just kind of sort of felt like
00:50:49.96 --> 00:50:55.24 you know creed it was like a creative feeling I guess maybe that drove that decision to make
00:50:55.24 --> 00:50:59.96 to be like oh yeah I just sort of rolled into it casually because you know like certain move like
00:50:59.96 --> 00:51:03.80 movie start in all kind of different ways you know some movie start just the way how you were saying
00:51:03.80 --> 00:51:09.56 like you want to start like it begins and then some movies just sort of start unfold yeah they don't
00:51:09.56 --> 00:51:14.12 know creed it's no nothing but it just sort of like people just sort of doing something you know
00:51:14.12 --> 00:51:18.12 like wait what are they doing okay let me see you know boom and it's sort of slowly develops into this
00:51:18.12 --> 00:51:24.76 thing then it maybe hits you with something and boom boom so I remember like I'm vaguely remember
00:51:24.76 --> 00:51:28.76 editing it and being like when should I start because we're talking a bunch before that too and
00:51:28.76 --> 00:51:34.68 then what so when should I just roll into this and then it was like me talking actually it was like
00:51:34.68 --> 00:51:40.36 what does that pomegranate pomegranate chy-ty because you're drinking the white tea and you're like
00:51:40.36 --> 00:51:45.56 white tea yeah and then man I remember thinking that it was like man yeah that was cool but then yeah
00:51:45.56 --> 00:51:53.56 you shut it down real quick you're like that is why but you I think even thinking back on it the way
00:51:53.56 --> 00:52:00.28 you had and given what you took it wound up talking about it so like that yours is way better
00:52:00.28 --> 00:52:05.48 it's way better yeah and I just did a bad job of out of the gate kind of explaining
00:52:05.48 --> 00:52:08.84 well hey this is not right yeah we didn't talk about it but what's interesting too is uh
00:52:09.48 --> 00:52:13.72 I think it was brand you know brand and pick worth yeah so he he we talking to me was a while ago
00:52:13.72 --> 00:52:21.16 he was like saying that out of the gate with this podcast it's you know when you hear people
00:52:21.16 --> 00:52:25.24 you go oh listen to Joe Rogan's first podcast or listen to him for even Tim Ferrissal say listen
00:52:25.24 --> 00:52:30.28 my first podcast I know what I was doing it's mono it's this it's that and it takes a while for
00:52:30.28 --> 00:52:35.88 people to kind of figure out where they're going I mean it might take 20 30 100 episodes or whatever
00:52:35.88 --> 00:52:41.40 at least 30 40 50 of people trying where they kind of find their groove and brand it was like
00:52:41.40 --> 00:52:47.32 out of the gate your podcast hasn't even changed that much I mean it's we did make you know I mean
00:52:47.32 --> 00:52:52.20 I think we've improved we've improved our audio we'd probably speak better now but it wasn't like
00:52:52.20 --> 00:52:58.68 it's not this drastic turnaround from we were doing something radically different the podcast
00:52:58.68 --> 00:53:05.80 is essentially the same now as it was on episode one it's essentially the same thing
00:53:06.68 --> 00:53:12.76 and so I and I think that did that is based on what I thought the podcast was going to be like
00:53:12.76 --> 00:53:17.80 and I should have done a better job of saying hey here's what we're doing but I didn't you know
00:53:17.80 --> 00:53:23.64 I didn't if you remember if you even think about it right now you know we don't like especially like
00:53:23.64 --> 00:53:29.32 creative stuff like you don't we don't really talk about you're just like you just do it and then if I
00:53:29.32 --> 00:53:35.40 didn't if I go off the rails in one way or another then you'll tighten me back up whatever but yeah we never
00:53:35.40 --> 00:53:38.92 did like it was like you said like one thing like hey we should do it in black and white
00:53:38.92 --> 00:53:45.32 actually did you even say that yeah and that was sort of it and then we talked about like the
00:53:45.32 --> 00:53:49.96 entire like the ideal look would be like an interrogation room I mean I used the term interrogation
00:53:49.96 --> 00:53:54.44 but just like super simple whatever but yeah other than that we're just you just sort of like
00:53:54.44 --> 00:54:02.68 let me do whatever the varying levels of success I guess and so then that that came out of the
00:54:02.68 --> 00:54:07.64 gate was we got really lucky I mean at the time there was in a lot of part there was there was a
00:54:07.64 --> 00:54:13.16 lot of podcast but there wasn't even close to number of podcasts that there are now and that went that went
00:54:13.16 --> 00:54:22.20 forward pretty quick and next thing you know we were like on it was it was happening I mean it was happening
00:54:22.20 --> 00:54:30.84 meaning meaning this idea of hey this is this will be cool to try it went from this will be cool to
00:54:30.84 --> 00:54:37.40 try to like we this is what we're doing it went to that in two or three episodes yeah I mean maybe it was
00:54:37.40 --> 00:54:43.32 even one episode I mean the first episode came out and it was like okay everyone said more and
00:54:43.88 --> 00:54:48.04 did we know yeah we did know we were gonna I told you we're gonna do one a week I think I think that was
00:54:48.04 --> 00:54:52.60 from the beginning it's like hey we're gonna do one a week there's a time when I wavered for a little while
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:59.56 probably 40 episodes and or something I was like I don't know if I can keep I don't know if I can get
00:54:59.56 --> 00:55:05.40 this much content red I don't know if I can do this so we might have to go to one every two weeks
00:55:05.40 --> 00:55:12.68 and I got shut down by the people yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I forget when that was but
00:55:12.68 --> 00:55:16.92 yes I remember that how I told I told a couple people that Ashland front was working with one
00:55:16.92 --> 00:55:24.92 guy named Mike great guy I was going to a job site with him and I just we were driving and I said yeah
00:55:24.92 --> 00:55:29.32 yeah you know I'm thinking about going to like maybe put in the podcast once every two weeks and
00:55:30.36 --> 00:55:35.64 hold it was yeah it was like I told him that you know there was a disease you know it was like
00:55:35.64 --> 00:55:41.32 really bad and and he that seeing his reaction there was one of the person I told the same thing
00:55:41.32 --> 00:55:49.32 and got the same exact reaction which was like he he almost he was almost like lost for words you know
00:55:49.32 --> 00:55:54.28 because this was early so there was still it wasn't like you could go oh well just let's no one
00:55:54.28 --> 00:55:58.52 that I haven't listened to or want to have it hurt no while this was hey there's only this many
00:55:58.52 --> 00:56:05.40 episodes and I'm waiting for the next one yeah you know I remember him being you you know you you
00:56:05.40 --> 00:56:09.16 should think about that and I remember what he said he said he said he said because there's people
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:14.36 that are waiting for these to come out yeah and I said to myself oh okay I got I got I got to
00:56:14.36 --> 00:56:20.44 get I got to work harder yeah and I could and I make sense yeah just work harder dude
00:56:21.72 --> 00:56:26.84 make sense too because of how like you know you were pretty like engaged with the people too
00:56:26.84 --> 00:56:30.44 and out and I was to like where people would be like hey that was this and that's why
00:56:30.44 --> 00:56:35.56 and you'd be engaged like online on Twitter and stuff like that so it kind of like it really
00:56:35.56 --> 00:56:39.88 felt like and in a lot of ways it still does feel like we were sort of all in this together like
00:56:39.88 --> 00:56:45.08 everyone like me knew doing it and then everyone whoever was listening like they were kind of in it too
00:56:45.08 --> 00:56:50.52 you know it still feels like that yeah and what's crazy is you go to Australia where we just
00:56:50.52 --> 00:56:57.000 were and it's the same way we're literally the other side of the world and people are asking
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.56 me about hey would you said this in episode 48 did you think and I'm like yes I did think that I could tell
00:57:03.56 --> 00:57:08.60 you know people are that into it yeah which is awesome but back in the day when it's when you
00:57:08.60 --> 00:57:13.48 first sort of start you're that feeling is so on the front of your mind like it feels like we're
00:57:13.48 --> 00:57:18.04 just all doing it people are giving me input because I'm trying to I mean I don't know about you
00:57:18.04 --> 00:57:22.04 but I was trying to figure out a lot of stuff early on as well like how to get certain things done
00:57:22.04 --> 00:57:25.96 or accomplish whatever and people were trying you know jumping out of the woodwork kind of like hey
00:57:25.96 --> 00:57:29.80 you should do this better you know you should compress the audio you should do so I'm taking it
00:57:29.80 --> 00:57:34.52 vice I'm you know so we're all sort of in it together and there was one episode I forget what episode
00:57:34.52 --> 00:57:40.92 it was when it sort of hit a point where there was so many downloads that it crashed our website
00:57:40.92 --> 00:57:47.08 and like the podcast like the hosting right and it um because you know when you start I don't know
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:51.72 about that I don't know about that can stuff like where after certain crazy too to think that
00:57:52.36 --> 00:57:58.60 yeah it's easy to think that we would have enough downloads that would crash the system yeah
00:57:58.60 --> 00:58:03.56 so and so of course I mean whether whether or not that came across my mind you know maybe
00:58:03.56 --> 00:58:07.80 maybe not but it wasn't like a worry I wasn't concerned about that at all I was like no this is
00:58:07.80 --> 00:58:14.60 okay it's a computer like whatever so you know you have this host for this and the website of this
00:58:14.60 --> 00:58:22.36 and that um and the the moment that I was like okay there's a lot of people like depending on
00:58:22.36 --> 00:58:28.04 this for like a better way of putting it is when it crashed on the day that I you know released a podcast
00:58:28.04 --> 00:58:33.48 it crashes so it's like you know whatever it says technically I gotta do all this stuff and
00:58:34.68 --> 00:58:41.08 just Twitter Facebook like emails like through the website my personal email like coming in like
00:58:41.08 --> 00:58:46.28 where's the podcast web and it was probably way less of a deal than then it seemed like to me at the
00:58:46.28 --> 00:58:51.32 time but still when you get like essentially let's face it strainers people I don't know like just
00:58:51.32 --> 00:58:54.84 by the hundreds just saying where's the podcast where's the podcast it's kind of like them
00:58:54.84 --> 00:58:58.92 saying hey where's our where's our dinner you know like where's our podcast and I'm like oh my gosh
00:58:58.92 --> 00:59:03.24 I'm like freaking out where you're then at the end of that I'm like we're gonna about you like oh man
00:59:03.24 --> 00:59:07.72 if I'm feeling this and I'm not even the star of the podcast what the hell is jokbo thinking and you
00:59:07.72 --> 00:59:11.80 gonna kill me and all this stuff and regret even doing this with me should it did it with some
00:59:11.80 --> 00:59:18.12 professional guy out of all this stuff and then everyone's gonna like text me hey so how's it going so
00:59:18.12 --> 00:59:23.96 to me that was the way that the way I interpreted that how is it going is like what the hell
00:59:23.96 --> 00:59:29.72 like the freaking but then you'd call everyone's well this was a amount of days like days are
00:59:29.72 --> 00:59:36.12 going on still well this is this is when the podcast crashed and I would text you like hey
00:59:36.12 --> 00:59:41.88 yeah like how's it going yeah are we making any progress yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember I was on
00:59:41.88 --> 00:59:47.48 an op I was in Iraq I was on my first deployment and we were traveling a far distance to the south
00:59:47.48 --> 00:59:54.36 of Iraq there was some mayhem going on we're traveling through this city there's eerie there's people
00:59:54.36 --> 01:00:01.88 whistling it's just it's the middle of the night and we get lost and we're driving around and I'm
01:00:02.68 --> 01:00:11.64 I'm tracking and so finally we stop and I go up to the lead nav who's a great guy in the lead
01:00:11.64 --> 01:00:19.88 vehicle and I look at him and I and I could see the look in his eyes like we're lost just know where we are
01:00:20.60 --> 01:00:28.28 and I go I go how's it going bro and and like just that right there like he is just his look of panic
01:00:28.92 --> 01:00:33.80 when I said hey how's it how's it going bro his look of panic went down a little bit
01:00:33.80 --> 01:00:43.08 and he goes I don't know where we are and I go okay cool this is I literally said I go okay cool
01:00:43.08 --> 01:00:47.88 we're gonna set a perimeter take your time figure out where we're at and how we can get back on
01:00:47.88 --> 01:00:54.92 track let me know when you're ready and he goes Roger that and and then it allowed him to actually
01:00:56.20 --> 01:01:01.40 decompress for a second and figure out where we were and it took him a minute two minutes and then
01:01:01.40 --> 01:01:07.72 he you know we did it so that idea of instead of texting you I wear this that's fine
01:01:07.72 --> 01:01:12.52 guys people are waiting for it yeah hey how's it going we make an any progress yeah
01:01:13.48 --> 01:01:19.24 yeah and so that became clear when you actually would like would call and be like hey you'd be like
01:01:19.24 --> 01:01:24.84 same that I think you said the same thing hey how's it going like in that way and you're right
01:01:24.84 --> 01:01:30.04 man it's that because bro I'm not used to that you know like when something's that was
01:01:30.04 --> 01:01:35.56 pressure and I work yeah you know you're pretty pressure no no I'm used to some pressure I mean
01:01:35.56 --> 01:01:40.76 it's facing them from quite not that much pressure but we're you know working for people in the
01:01:40.76 --> 01:01:44.76 deadline hurry up and you know like this and you know where are we with it something going wrong
01:01:44.76 --> 01:01:49.56 and stuff like that I that okay I'm no stranger to that but the reaction for the people who I'm
01:01:49.56 --> 01:01:55.16 working quote unquote for I'm not used to them being so cool about it usually them saying
01:01:55.16 --> 01:02:01.56 well yeah you know their frustration is now you know kind of part of my world my added
01:02:01.56 --> 01:02:08.28 for us or stress whatever so when you came with that with how's it going bro it was like I was
01:02:08.28 --> 01:02:14.44 like dang this is like it really helped really helped a lot so meanwhile but still the problem
01:02:14.44 --> 01:02:19.80 still there meanwhile I'm not giving that level of coolness from the general public our people
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:26.76 and it you know it morphed into jokes about echo how he's not an old cruising too hard and
01:02:26.76 --> 01:02:32.76 like all this stuff which is kind of cool I guess it's funny but anyway then our savior Brady Lanter
01:02:32.76 --> 01:02:37.40 comes and is like hey I can I can help you with this and all that all knows all this technical
01:02:37.40 --> 01:02:41.88 background stuff which I knew like a little bit from web development but he knew like the real
01:02:41.88 --> 01:02:47.96 tech side and man he basically took my hand and held my hand and called some people and boom boom
01:02:47.96 --> 01:02:51.40 you gotta do this hey we gotta spend a little bit more money to do this but we can we can
01:02:51.40 --> 01:02:57.56 patch it up and man he got it he got it rolling and like literally solved that problem forever
01:02:58.44 --> 01:03:05.80 so man but point is there where that's when I knew that yeah like how you say like you can't
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:10.92 really do a twice or once every two weeks because people were like hey we kind of need this thing
01:03:10.92 --> 01:03:16.12 that's when it was clear to me that yeah man it's we kind of have like we're all kind of in this
01:03:16.12 --> 01:03:21.40 together and you can't just bust out once every two weeks yeah and you also can and I mean I always
01:03:21.40 --> 01:03:24.68 feel this way about everything too but you also can't be like oh you know what we'll just throw
01:03:24.68 --> 01:03:29.80 something together and put it out there like that's not happening so it has to be a real effort
01:03:30.36 --> 01:03:38.52 100% of the time yeah or it's a failure all right so that's cool you get some technical
01:03:38.52 --> 01:03:47.48 knowledge from just the function of being the guy that's putting this stuff together what about just
01:03:48.12 --> 01:03:57.56 from sitting across the table for what do we almost four years yeah almost four years what are
01:03:57.56 --> 01:04:05.48 the lessons learned from a broader perspective life wise well they yeah it started quick to so okay
01:04:05.48 --> 01:04:13.16 so remember get what the early episodes like I would drink I would have a drink going you know
01:04:13.16 --> 01:04:16.68 I wouldn't get hammered nothing you say drink you mean alcohol yeah like that
01:04:16.68 --> 01:04:20.92 feature not talking to joccal discipline go or a joccal white tea yeah yeah little a hit
01:04:20.92 --> 01:04:25.40 discipline hitter yeah talking your drinking what did you use to drink vodka and
01:04:26.36 --> 01:04:31.64 soda water there you go yeah or it was sometimes a beer whatever but it was like that was one of
01:04:31.64 --> 01:04:37.08 those things and not that I was like nervous doing it but I was like kind of nervous going into it
01:04:37.08 --> 01:04:41.48 kind of thing and it was just yeah like a little comfort thing whatever and it was one of the
01:04:41.48 --> 01:04:45.80 things where you didn't necessarily tell me like hey you don't need to do that you know like you
01:04:45.80 --> 01:04:50.44 or that's weak or now that you didn't tell me that but there was always like this feeling of it you know
01:04:51.32 --> 01:04:58.84 and it kind of hit me where it's like yes p right yeah kind of what he's just sensitive
01:04:58.84 --> 01:05:07.48 extra sensory perception yeah that's like me just kind of willing like thoughts into your head I guess
01:05:07.88 --> 01:05:13.64 but there's it's like one of the earlier things that you said and not necessarily to me but just
01:05:13.64 --> 01:05:17.96 on the podcast that you know like you say a lot of stuff and it's kind of like and you are essentially
01:05:17.96 --> 01:05:22.60 talking to me right you're sitting across talking to me but one of the things you said was you already
01:05:22.60 --> 01:05:26.20 know the right thing to do you just have to do it and then I'm like oh yeah I'm thinking like okay
01:05:26.20 --> 01:05:30.36 I heard that before but but you start to think about it and I call it and that's true huh
01:05:30.36 --> 01:05:36.68 like you just you know already it's not like a big like mystery like you know so it's like
01:05:36.68 --> 01:05:42.44 water because it's kind of lame to know the right thing to do and not do it there has to be
01:05:42.44 --> 01:05:49.48 something too with the fact that you're not just hearing me say the words but you are a person
01:05:49.48 --> 01:05:55.80 that actually sees what I'm doing on a daily basis in a way yeah you know what I'm doing
01:05:55.80 --> 01:06:01.72 yeah you see what I'm doing so when I'm saying that it's not like oh you
01:06:03.56 --> 01:06:09.56 whatever what's that word drifted through what's like scrolled through your Instagram feed and
01:06:09.56 --> 01:06:15.24 someone said you already know what to do just do it you're actually watching me and saying oh yeah
01:06:15.24 --> 01:06:21.000 he's he knows what he's supposed to do and he's doing yes so and and here's the here's when that
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.32 part became clear where the first time okay so okay so I'm recording a podcast let's say five
01:06:27.32 --> 01:06:32.12 episodes and we'll just say I don't know maybe it's more maybe it's less but five episodes in
01:06:32.12 --> 01:06:37.72 it's like okay that's five weeks every week now and we were recording in my house at this time
01:06:37.72 --> 01:06:41.80 and you'd come up and it was like at night yep we have to do it after uh President was asleep
01:06:41.80 --> 01:06:47.16 yeah after when it's going to see and um and you'd come up we'd record him like cool and one time
01:06:47.16 --> 01:06:52.84 I'm like shoot this is like again again again and then you're coming in with your notes and
01:06:52.84 --> 01:06:58.20 all this something man this guy is like this guy is like no quit because it was like you can
01:06:58.20 --> 01:07:02.36 be doing the coolest fun of thing but when it's like coming again and again and again you're like
01:07:02.36 --> 01:07:08.28 well let me take a rest between sets here a little bit you know but nope not you you're just rolling
01:07:08.28 --> 01:07:13.08 in and then after well when when I start getting used to it that's when I'd like sort of
01:07:13.08 --> 01:07:19.000 reflect like man if you weren't here doing this right now if I let's say I'd feel my little weirdo
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.24 dream of having a podcast and that's my job I don't think I would I don't think I would have done it
01:07:25.24 --> 01:07:30.84 as well as often for sure I would have started slowing down or whatever because there would be
01:07:30.84 --> 01:07:34.68 times where I'd be like man maybe we should just take this week off kind of thing and it's not
01:07:34.68 --> 01:07:38.60 like it's this crazy hard work I'm just saying it's just that's sort of how it is but it seems like
01:07:38.60 --> 01:07:45.80 that didn't phase you at all I remember one time I had a gig on the east coast and I flew and
01:07:45.80 --> 01:07:51.48 then I had another gig on the east coast and I had whatever a day in between and we and we owed a
01:07:51.48 --> 01:07:57.72 podcast and I flew back to San Diego we went record of the podcast and I flew back out to the east
01:07:57.72 --> 01:08:05.16 coast yeah and I said that's what we're doing here yeah this podcast yeah yeah man and that's it's like
01:08:05.16 --> 01:08:11.80 that is so such a for lack of a term like I'm so lucky in that way because like that that's not
01:08:11.80 --> 01:08:17.64 like a rare thing where you're hanging around with someone and they rub off on you you know where
01:08:17.64 --> 01:08:21.48 you knew all this stuff but since the person right next to you is doing it then you start to do it
01:08:21.48 --> 01:08:25.32 you know it's like like jiu-jitsu you know you hear about jiu-jitsu we know about jiu-jitsu whatever
01:08:25.32 --> 01:08:29.88 but it's like what if like your brother starts to do in jiu-jitsu whatever or the people at work
01:08:29.88 --> 01:08:34.28 start doing jiu-jitsu then you know let me go check this out it like it kind of influences you you know
01:08:34.28 --> 01:08:40.36 in that way so it's lucky that like and if this is every week not to mention all the training jiu-jitsu
01:08:40.36 --> 01:08:44.12 so I'm around you more and we're talking about it and it's new and excited so we're always talking
01:08:44.12 --> 01:08:49.88 about so oh yeah man I was just primed for influence at that time so at that point I was like yeah
01:08:49.88 --> 01:08:55.56 man he's he's really doing it and going back to you already know the right thing to do you just
01:08:55.56 --> 01:09:00.20 have to do it mean it was so I'm like okay and then I see you doing it so that influenced me to like
01:09:00.20 --> 01:09:06.12 really take that into considerations for us like daily conscious thought you know so so then what
01:09:06.12 --> 01:09:11.80 of that what did that actually turn into as far as action wise get first I stopped drinking and
01:09:11.80 --> 01:09:17.72 here's the idea it stopped drinking but I stopped drinking where that was like a habit so I stopped that
01:09:18.36 --> 01:09:23.32 and so you went from jiu-jitsu to drink every day every day yeah how often do you drink now
01:09:23.32 --> 01:09:30.44 well there's no like often like sometimes I'll drink sometimes I won't but yeah yeah once a month
01:09:30.44 --> 01:09:35.56 once a week sometimes yeah yeah sometimes none a month zero a month but then sometimes like three
01:09:35.56 --> 01:09:41.40 times a week whatever and this is just how it shook itself out like now it's not a habitual thing
01:09:41.40 --> 01:09:46.92 every night you know it's just it's more of a yeah I can maneuver my way through any like drinking
01:09:46.92 --> 01:09:52.68 scenario you know and I don't even know if I was like addicted like an alcoholic I mean maybe
01:09:52.68 --> 01:09:59.08 technically on paper or something maybe but it was a kind and it was basically this if I had
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:04.12 three and I think I told you this before where there was three factors with me drinking a lot
01:10:04.12 --> 01:10:09.64 and that was if I was undisturbed meaning by like my family or any like obligations you know
01:10:09.64 --> 01:10:13.96 like I got to drive somewhere or take care of the kids or whatever underserved
01:10:14.84 --> 01:10:19.56 meaning if you had no responsibility at a certain time that's certain time yeah so that's an
01:10:19.56 --> 01:10:24.28 opportunity to drink and a likelihood drink yes okay that was a factor put it out and then
01:10:24.92 --> 01:10:30.44 the other one was obviously alcohol present right and then the third one was being in front of my
01:10:30.44 --> 01:10:37.96 computer that was it if any of those if one or more of those three factors were not there like I
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:42.20 wouldn't drink I'm not compelled to drink at all you know like I'm not against drinking like I'll
01:10:42.20 --> 01:10:48.36 go out and drink sake or someone you'd see for whatever but it was a non factor but if you get those
01:10:48.36 --> 01:10:52.68 three especially back then if I had those three present which was essentially every night
01:10:52.68 --> 01:10:57.32 the kids go to bed you know I don't have to wake up early for something specific or whatever
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:02.52 my computer and it's weird because it wasn't my laptop when I'm traveling or something like that
01:11:02.52 --> 01:11:09.000 it was like my home computer it's weird but if those three things were present like it was
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.12 it was pretty much uncontrollable so then what was it that broke that that thing like your thing
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:21.000 where it's like you know the right thing to do you just look at it you know like and this is
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.80 I think always gonna be the case I'm sure it's something has to do with your brain but
01:11:27.32 --> 01:11:31.08 like you can know the right thing to do you can do you know but you it's almost like you
01:11:31.08 --> 01:11:37.32 oversimplify it you're like hey how do you wake up early wake up early you know but a real person
01:11:37.96 --> 01:11:42.36 will be like how do I wake up early okay yeah I wake up early yeah that's where I want to get how
01:11:42.36 --> 01:11:47.24 do I do that you're like yeah just do it it's like you're skipping all these like mental who's
01:11:47.24 --> 01:11:54.04 and acrobatics that normal people do on like emotions and habits and like all this like stuff
01:11:54.04 --> 01:11:58.60 that we have to sort of go through to get there you know because we like certain comforts in fact
01:11:58.60 --> 01:12:03.000 not only do we like come this like we can sort of need them in a little bit a little bit of a time
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.32 yourself right exactly right and you kind of oversimplify it so come in from someone just
01:12:09.32 --> 01:12:15.08 telling you that oh yeah just wake up early you're like okay like I shouldn't even have asked you
01:12:15.08 --> 01:12:18.52 because that's essentially in a way it's not really what I'm asking like I know that part
01:12:19.40 --> 01:12:24.28 like how do I get there how do I make that part like more accessible or that ability more
01:12:24.28 --> 01:12:29.64 accessible to to myself that's kind of what they're asking but mean well like I'm watching you do
01:12:29.64 --> 01:12:34.20 all these things and it's kind of like that's how you are you just oversimplify it kind of thing
01:12:34.20 --> 01:12:38.76 like you just all right I'm just gonna do it right and there's more to it but like what I'm
01:12:38.76 --> 01:12:45.08 seeing you just do it so I guess I'm just gonna do it then and then you do it then it's kind of like
01:12:45.08 --> 01:12:51.08 off probably should it done that like ten years ago that is literally how simple it is granted
01:12:51.08 --> 01:12:57.32 it'll make it'll be just as simple or just as complex and hard and you know slippery of the situation
01:12:57.32 --> 01:13:06.12 as as you make it as you allow it to be yeah and allow it yeah but when you kind of when I think back
01:13:06.12 --> 01:13:13.72 on on it for myself I'm like making it complicated like putting effort into making it and I still
01:13:13.72 --> 01:13:18.28 do it that's one step further it's one step further than allowing it to be it's actually making
01:13:18.28 --> 01:13:22.12 it kind of I think that's almost how it's are that's the thing so okay so here's another thing
01:13:22.12 --> 01:13:26.92 that I learned when you're like and it it does go back to just you know the right things
01:13:26.92 --> 01:13:31.72 it's just do it regardless how you feel about like working out right so I work and I like to
01:13:31.72 --> 01:13:35.72 work you know weightlifting and stuff I sort of liked it you know sort of one of those things look
01:13:35.72 --> 01:13:39.48 for it but you know I get all the other responsibilities and all this stuff you don't
01:13:40.12 --> 01:13:44.04 necessarily like it as much but you know it's good for you know this stuff so
01:13:44.76 --> 01:13:49.24 there is a point where it was really easy to justify and skip workouts let's do it tomorrow whatever
01:13:50.60 --> 01:13:54.60 because they don't feel like it I can didn't get enough rest or I'm doing this other thing or
01:13:54.60 --> 01:13:59.000 whatever right but if you're just like hey you know it needs to be done you just do it don't think
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.72 about it don't think about but that's not really how my brain worked my brain worked where I was
01:14:03.72 --> 01:14:08.84 kind of dependent on that that good feeling of looking forward to working out and getting fired up
01:14:08.84 --> 01:14:13.64 and working out and I was kind of dependent on that feeling you don't realize it but it's there
01:14:13.64 --> 01:14:17.80 fully where you're depending on it so you're just like hey you just don't think about just do it but
01:14:17.80 --> 01:14:22.36 I'm like wait but I really don't feel like it you know like that's just a given I don't feel like
01:14:22.36 --> 01:14:26.92 like that's like given part of the equation so then what I would do is okay I'll just do it but
01:14:26.92 --> 01:14:32.12 not do it like I just do it as in workout I just do it as in trying to get fired up and try to
01:14:32.12 --> 01:14:37.64 get myself motivated and get get fired up to do this stuff but that's not that's not how it works you
01:14:37.64 --> 01:14:43.08 just get you don't you don't work harder to get that unnecessary part of it into the equation
01:14:43.08 --> 01:14:49.08 you can if it were free but but that's not the point you were that I took from it the point is you
01:14:49.08 --> 01:14:54.04 skip that but you could just go work out just do it you know kind of thing and it's like I
01:14:54.04 --> 01:15:00.68 so simple when I'm like seen it out loud it's like that's a good connection to make it's a good
01:15:00.68 --> 01:15:08.84 connection to make when it's like just go do the activity it's not just it's not hey just force yourself
01:15:08.84 --> 01:15:15.40 to get fired up just force yourself no just can't even do that yes you can try but
01:15:15.40 --> 01:15:20.20 why waste the energy on that just go do the activity that you're supposed to do yeah and then another
01:15:20.20 --> 01:15:23.96 thing is like you make a good point it's like a lot of this stuff is just sort of there and you're just
01:15:23.96 --> 01:15:30.20 there to like grab my hand and like be like here see the thing you've been seen this whole time here
01:15:30.20 --> 01:15:36.20 it's crazy okay so when you're learning if you ever learned something in GJ2 we cannot believe
01:15:36.20 --> 01:15:40.28 that you couldn't figure that out that you didn't figure that out I'll give you an example here's a real
01:15:40.28 --> 01:15:48.84 simple example um you're mounted on someone and they start to push your knee or with their hand or
01:15:48.84 --> 01:15:54.76 their elbow to start now but escape I remember like people would do this to me I mean I'm
01:15:54.76 --> 01:16:01.32 I'm a white belt maybe even I'm a blue belt and I think I asked Dean I'm like hey Dean what do
01:16:01.32 --> 01:16:08.68 you do when they start pushing and he goes oh so he does it to me or he you know he he mounts me
01:16:08.68 --> 01:16:12.12 and he goes here push my knee so I start pushing his knee he reached down and sand pulled it off
01:16:12.12 --> 01:16:20.76 yeah and and and the answer was so obvious and this is one of hundreds of examples and I'm not the
01:16:20.76 --> 01:16:26.76 smartest guy in the world but I'm not that stupid either and for me to not be able to figure out
01:16:26.76 --> 01:16:32.28 certain things it shows you that if you can't it shows you that there's certain things that can be
01:16:32.28 --> 01:16:36.76 right in front of your face and you just don't see him and I think that's what you're talking about like
01:16:37.40 --> 01:16:41.32 I'm not holding your hand but I'm just going hey no no no wait let me show you exactly what
01:16:41.32 --> 01:16:46.20 do you just do this yeah it's like oh yeah and there's a lot you know there's I've heard many
01:16:46.20 --> 01:16:50.68 people have told me that that's what they got from the podcast or that that's what they got from
01:16:50.68 --> 01:16:54.44 extreme ownership or the economy leadership or the discipline equals freedom field manual they're like
01:16:54.44 --> 01:17:00.92 I always thought that I always knew that I mean I was just with the Australian when we were
01:17:00.92 --> 01:17:04.60 at the monster you know the Australian guy that was in the military for what a long time
01:17:05.48 --> 01:17:07.88 and he said yeah when I read when I read your book I was like
01:17:07.88 --> 01:17:14.36 yes you just put in the words what I the way I've been trying to lead and the good thing about that is
01:17:15.08 --> 01:17:21.16 you have the idea in your head of what's good but you don't necessarily codify it where you can
01:17:21.16 --> 01:17:27.32 now say yes this is the answer so that's a it's a big step it's like occasion you randomly pull
01:17:27.32 --> 01:17:31.32 the hand that's getting you in the mouth you might do the case but you don't actually know it
01:17:31.32 --> 01:17:34.92 and identify it as something you can do where's one should go oh when someone's doing that here's the reaction
01:17:34.92 --> 01:17:43.56 book do so there's there's a definite plus to that yeah and and that rabbit hole of like
01:17:43.56 --> 01:17:49.96 revelations like that is is endless keeps like going and going and going and and certain things you
01:17:49.96 --> 01:17:54.52 sort of forget to you know because you know a human being we're all human beings with habits and
01:17:54.52 --> 01:18:00.68 stuff like that so you forget certain ones or whatever but man it's like they're everywhere so even
01:18:00.68 --> 01:18:07.64 like the whole just the whole concept of if you don't feel like doing it but you need you know that
01:18:07.64 --> 01:18:12.36 it has to get needs to get done or whatever or even just that you want it to be done but you don't
01:18:12.36 --> 01:18:17.40 feel like it just the just excluding the part that you don't feel like it just doing that
01:18:18.44 --> 01:18:24.28 seems like super simple it seems easy it is very simple it seems like pretty easy when you say it
01:18:24.28 --> 01:18:29.32 and then when you go through it it's like it seems so hard but the weird to end this is nothing new
01:18:29.32 --> 01:18:34.76 where once you once you get it done like okay so an email right I don't know you may or may not go
01:18:34.76 --> 01:18:39.56 through this but a lot of us go through this where it's like you have this nagging email of someone
01:18:39.56 --> 01:18:43.88 that you have to respond to someone and to respond to him you need certain information and to get that
01:18:43.88 --> 01:18:49.24 information you got to go reopen some files and stuff like that it'll take two minutes to minute probably
01:18:49.24 --> 01:18:55.000 not even two minutes but you got to your brain has to stop thinking this way it has to pivot and change
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.52 these weird directions and do all this other stuff right so you just don't feel like doing that right
01:19:00.52 --> 01:19:04.60 now I'm doing this other stuff or I'm just not doing that right now I'll do it tomorrow do it later
01:19:04.60 --> 01:19:10.12 today whatever and then it winds up being like weeks and meanwhile still there that email still
01:19:10.12 --> 01:19:14.76 hanging over your head hanging over your head then you're like a seven talk about that on the
01:19:14.76 --> 01:19:19.40 warrior kid podcast letting your homework hang over your head yeah I did actually there's some
01:19:19.40 --> 01:19:22.84 kids that probably didn't know what hang over your head I kind of kind of explained what that means
01:19:22.84 --> 01:19:25.88 yes because when something's hanging over your head what are you waiting you're waiting for that thing
01:19:25.88 --> 01:19:31.40 to hit you so you don't want that you've got when you get home from school do your homework don't
01:19:31.40 --> 01:19:36.36 let it hang over you ruin that whole night so that email is going to ruin your all night you're
01:19:36.36 --> 01:19:41.48 holding thing your whole life you're alive so I mean I'm in this huge way but it'll be nagging
01:19:41.48 --> 01:19:45.72 it's like you know it's kind of like when you're sleeping and you get to use bathroom and you're like
01:19:46.60 --> 01:19:51.40 just go use it about them you don't want to get a stand up just go just do it anyway so meanwhile
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:55.24 okay then finally you're like you know what finally I feel like you're finally I can't take it anymore
01:19:55.24 --> 01:19:59.16 finally it's your take it it's your take me enough so I'll do it you go on the email you take
01:19:59.16 --> 01:20:02.84 care the thing you do it it takes two minutes or whatever you're done you're like proud white
01:20:02.84 --> 01:20:08.12 and I just do that a long time ago I wouldn't have felt any of that stress or whatever and so
01:20:08.68 --> 01:20:12.76 but habitually going into that mode where it's like okay this needs to get done I don't care how I
01:20:12.76 --> 01:20:18.04 feel I'm just going to do it real quick like that in and of itself is a habit is a way you know
01:20:18.04 --> 01:20:26.12 is a way of thinking at the very least so if that was something that I got better at as well
01:20:27.08 --> 01:20:31.88 the other thing that's been interesting well interesting from my perspective
01:20:32.60 --> 01:20:38.04 is that you are de facto detached during this whole thing so you get to be
01:20:39.40 --> 01:20:45.32 I mean first of even when if I'm recovering a book I mean you're listening but you get to kind of
01:20:45.32 --> 01:20:51.56 observe me reading the book thinking about the book talking about the book when we have guests on
01:20:52.52 --> 01:20:57.64 a lot of times you don't say anything and you're just completely getting to observe this whole thing
01:20:57.64 --> 01:21:04.44 unfold from the outside so you I know we've gotten done with some podcast and and someone would ask
01:21:04.44 --> 01:21:09.72 me say like well how was that like one of our guests would say how was it and I'll look at you
01:21:09.72 --> 01:21:15.88 and say how was it because I'm in it and you have a better perspective because you are literally
01:21:15.88 --> 01:21:25.80 detached and watching it I mean I'm somewhat detached but I'm also reading writing thinking engaging
01:21:25.80 --> 01:21:29.24 answering so I'm doing all those things and I'm detached from that enough you know I've
01:21:29.24 --> 01:21:35.24 detached from it enough that I can guide the conversation I'm detached from it enough that I'm not
01:21:35.24 --> 01:21:39.64 getting too emotional or to stuck on something or I mean let's let's face it there's been
01:21:39.64 --> 01:21:45.16 some danger close calls for those emotions are creeping up you know sit across from a from a guy
01:21:45.16 --> 01:21:49.72 that's you know what had been through whatever and you're bringing those emotions back out of them and
01:21:49.72 --> 01:21:54.04 I mean it can get danger close for sure and sometimes I got to do a little detachment to keep it
01:21:54.04 --> 01:21:59.24 real but you all and sometimes I do a better job of detaching a mess than you do because
01:21:59.64 --> 01:22:03.32 because you'll be over in the court or you'll be sitting in your chair you know and I got to
01:22:03.32 --> 01:22:10.76 I got to try and keep it together because you're not so but that's sometimes sometimes you
01:22:10.76 --> 01:22:15.80 get wrapped up in the emotions of the story yourself especially when asked to do with kids you
01:22:15.80 --> 01:22:22.04 kind of lose the bubble and so but other than those moments a lot of times you're sitting there
01:22:22.04 --> 01:22:30.04 just listening and you're detached so you kind of get to you kind of get a great perspective of it
01:22:30.04 --> 01:22:40.12 which is nice yes sir yeah it's a I'm like maybe 60% maybe 50% detached because I'm like I'm
01:22:40.12 --> 01:22:44.52 the audience member just like everybody else really like when you're talking about stuff and
01:22:44.52 --> 01:22:48.44 or when you're interviewing someone like man I'm enjoying the show like everybody else but
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.56 I'm like in the show as well you know so as an audience member we'll say that's how I can
01:22:55.56 --> 01:23:00.12 evaluate and that was a good show or like really what you guys didn't even talk to him or you know
01:23:00.12 --> 01:23:05.16 anything and I'm not saying that it's ever happened I'm not saying it you know but
01:23:06.04 --> 01:23:11.48 that and that's why it is you know so yeah I will be affected by these things and but then
01:23:11.48 --> 01:23:16.28 I'll be affected even more because yes I am part of it like I'm in it you know I'm sitting in your
01:23:16.28 --> 01:23:22.36 classroom you guys but yes yeah because when you're talking whether you or even like let's say
01:23:22.36 --> 01:23:27.40 what I'm talking even right now like there's a few things sort of rolling in my brain like okay
01:23:28.12 --> 01:23:33.08 sure I say what I'm going to say my little idea and it comes out but then there's like a post
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:38.60 talk thought is this thing yeah exactly like a little assistant like shit or am I saying the
01:23:38.60 --> 01:23:42.44 right thing you know or did that sound dumb it's like it's just a constant like small like
01:23:42.44 --> 01:23:47.000 humming evaluation kind of process that's going on and then it's like okay like doing
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.52 want to interrupt at this point because I have a thought but no I couldn't so I'm sort of minding
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:55.64 my pees and queues as well you know so there's all these little things that hold you in and not
01:23:55.64 --> 01:24:00.20 it won't it'll kind of keep you from being detached but I don't have that one I'm not saying anything you
01:24:00.20 --> 01:24:04.52 know but yeah even you I mean I would imagine you're you kind of have the same thing you know
01:24:04.52 --> 01:24:08.68 you have to run this you have to yeah I gotta think about what I'm saying at the same time
01:24:08.68 --> 01:24:14.28 this is this is the dichotomy of that if you think about what you're saying too much it's not
01:24:14.28 --> 01:24:18.04 good it's just like jiu jitsu right if you're thinking about it move it's too late if you if you're
01:24:18.04 --> 01:24:21.32 analyzing what you're gonna say before it comes out of your mouth to make sure that's the right
01:24:21.32 --> 01:24:27.16 thing where you you're you're not not the right thing to do at the same time you can't just go
01:24:27.16 --> 01:24:32.36 verbal diarrhea and just start spewing stuff out because now you now you may say some stuff
01:24:32.36 --> 01:24:37.56 that you shouldn't say so there's a little a little game that you have to play you have to you have to
01:24:37.56 --> 01:24:42.60 kind of assess that stuff you have to be detached from your doing it to make sure that you don't say
01:24:42.60 --> 01:24:49.56 something stupid and you can say stupid stuff I mean I I think about the amount of interviews
01:24:49.56 --> 01:24:53.80 I've done and and just like you yeah you never know when it's gonna come I'm sure at some point
01:24:53.80 --> 01:24:58.76 I'm gonna say something go oh yeah I wouldn't have said that I should have never said that
01:25:00.60 --> 01:25:06.36 because it is what it is yeah and you could I mean it makes sense too where you can
01:25:07.08 --> 01:25:10.92 you can have a certain thought and then there's like how do you say that thought right like how do you
01:25:10.92 --> 01:25:18.52 how do you articulate your thoughts right and to expect or to think that like if you have a thought
01:25:18.52 --> 01:25:22.92 it'll be perfectly articulated or whatever those don't go hand in hand you know some people are
01:25:22.92 --> 01:25:27.16 super good at it like in fact you're like you're one of the better people that I've witnessed anyway
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:32.20 that at that probably you know probably because he keeps things pretty simple most of the time but
01:25:32.76 --> 01:25:37.24 at the same time like you're not immune to that you know so sometimes like your articulation of a
01:25:37.24 --> 01:25:42.60 certain thought will come off like different you know it'll come off like it might even be accurate
01:25:42.60 --> 01:25:45.88 but then the way it'll land on people will be like okay and I'm not saying this
01:25:45.88 --> 01:25:49.72 necessarily has happened I'm saying this this type of stuff can't happen so it'll be like oh yeah
01:25:49.72 --> 01:25:56.12 you came off as like insensitive or you don't understand or or your races or you're you know
01:25:56.12 --> 01:26:01.24 like all these interpretations that seem like reasonable interpretations given the words that you said
01:26:01.24 --> 01:26:05.72 but it's like man that was just I shouldn't have said it that way because it's not quite as accurate
01:26:05.72 --> 01:26:11.72 as what I think you know so yeah you got constantly monitored monitor that so it'll jam you up
01:26:11.72 --> 01:26:16.44 that's right there for that yeah what about in terms of relationships like
01:26:17.40 --> 01:26:24.20 your wife what if you take it away just take it man is your wife does your wife like you more now
01:26:24.20 --> 01:26:31.56 yeah or before I think I think she likes me more now put it this way like I
01:26:31.56 --> 01:26:40.52 I like our relationship better now and that's saying a lot because like we have a good
01:26:40.52 --> 01:26:44.68 we already had a good relationship you know like I was one of these we're like these people
01:26:44.68 --> 01:26:48.44 who we knew each other before we started dating like we knew it so there was no like
01:26:51.32 --> 01:26:56.12 you can you can you can you can jam yourself up I think sometimes like if you jump into a
01:26:56.12 --> 01:27:00.60 dating situation like super early and then a married situation super early and whatever like
01:27:00.60 --> 01:27:04.60 you can jam yourself up I'm saying no it's not because but you can and I'm not saying if you
01:27:04.60 --> 01:27:07.96 know someone for a long time and take it so I'm not saying that's a perfect like solution I'm not saying
01:27:07.96 --> 01:27:13.96 that but in our case we took it like super slow so there was like we had a solid foundation
01:27:13.96 --> 01:27:19.08 have a solid foundation so the point there we had a good relationship but you know like in your
01:27:19.08 --> 01:27:23.16 relationship there's like arguments you know me since Danny I'm sorry I shouldn't act it like that
01:27:23.16 --> 01:27:29.08 you know there's like way less of that like because I know like habitually how to
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:36.12 how to act you know so okay so extreme ownership right extreme ownership perfect that goes deep
01:27:36.12 --> 01:27:40.92 well it's it's that's a concert like that rabbit hole right there is like you've at first
01:27:40.92 --> 01:27:45.000 when you first like get introduced to it like oh yeah everything then you're like yeah okay
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.24 make sense like I could get that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:27:47.24 --> 01:27:52.36 I get the concert together don't blame I get it right but there's like so many levels of
01:27:52.36 --> 01:27:57.48 blaming so many there's like the overt like hey you should have done this like blaming right
01:27:57.48 --> 01:28:03.56 the kind I think it I say it I'm blaming 100% then there's like oh you know it's not your fault
01:28:03.56 --> 01:28:07.96 but inside your head you're like it's your fault you know so that'll drive certain other like
01:28:07.96 --> 01:28:13.16 a subsequent like behavior you know then there's like okay I know I'm supposed to take
01:28:13.16 --> 01:28:16.92 I'm you're thinking this area I'm supposed to take extreme ownership so I'm not gonna blame them
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:22.12 so it's not your it's my fault you know but meanwhile your behavior it doesn't like take
01:28:22.12 --> 01:28:27.16 full responsibility because kind of sort of quote unquote deep down you know it's not fully
01:28:27.16 --> 01:28:31.56 air you know it's kind of and it just goes deeper and deeper and then you find out all these
01:28:31.56 --> 01:28:37.96 little pockets of like non extreme ownership you know that you have and to me
01:28:39.32 --> 01:28:45.80 granted you know my life is very specific but with your wife or I guess kids but that's different
01:28:45.80 --> 01:28:51.96 but with your wife is a good it's a good battlefield to to to to test that out and to learn about it
01:28:51.96 --> 01:28:56.20 because it can get so emotional you know like yeah and you don't really have a break from it you
01:28:56.20 --> 01:29:00.52 know it's like I work it's like cool that didn't work even if I messed up I could still go home
01:29:00.52 --> 01:29:05.64 to my lovely family or go out to the bar I I have a break from it you know with your wife it's
01:29:05.64 --> 01:29:09.24 like you don't have a break from it it's like you you got a performance you know like you got
01:29:09.24 --> 01:29:14.76 it kind of means a lot it matters a lot so I think it it works good but at the same time
01:29:14.76 --> 01:29:20.36 you guys both have a commitment to be there so it's like you can get cuts some slack most of the time
01:29:20.36 --> 01:29:27.64 obviously depends on you like but in my case that's how it was so what I sort of discovered and
01:29:27.64 --> 01:29:33.80 continue to discover like just how good it works it's how good like extra ownership just and
01:29:33.80 --> 01:29:38.44 everything that comes with it you know like not blaming all the little tips that you'll say like
01:29:38.44 --> 01:29:44.20 um what is the one where like what do you say absorb and something you know when they come at you
01:29:44.20 --> 01:29:48.52 with something that happened to them like can you believe like yeah yeah yeah like that
01:29:48.52 --> 01:29:56.68 huh man man go hold and take it right there man so good even like and that reflect in diminish
01:29:58.04 --> 01:30:02.84 in fact you can even use it in like you can just reflect oh for you even have to diminish just jump
01:30:02.84 --> 01:30:07.16 on to say if it doesn't mean anything you know just jump on our side right now you know well yeah
01:30:07.16 --> 01:30:10.92 you can jump on the side the thing is with the reason that diminish is important on reflecting
01:30:10.92 --> 01:30:16.92 diminish is because if you can fuel the fire even more what you want to move towards is a solution
01:30:16.92 --> 01:30:21.24 you want to you want to de-escalate the situation yeah but the best way to do that is to
01:30:21.24 --> 01:30:25.24 reflect the emotions that they're showing and then diminish them a little bit so that they come
01:30:25.24 --> 01:30:29.96 so that they're on your side yes but then they start to calm down yeah so you can like um you can
01:30:29.96 --> 01:30:35.72 ref so that what I when I just said that I'm thinking of like a few different scenarios where
01:30:35.72 --> 01:30:40.68 I'll just reflet I won't even diminish until like the next day or something like you know so
01:30:40.68 --> 01:30:45.80 it's essentially it's really but I'll just reflect it's extended reflect oh man you know how
01:30:45.80 --> 01:30:50.84 much it does for your your limit well I'm speaking about myself but I don't know but no it's true
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:55.000 and and by the way you're talking about this from a marriage perspective I'm talking about it from
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.64 from a leadership perspective but and they're the same thing they're the same thing but what's
01:30:59.64 --> 01:31:02.92 interesting is you just said you know how good this is and you're right and you know what you got
01:31:02.92 --> 01:31:10.20 to be careful of that because it's an easy way to bond with someone is they come and say the boss sucks
01:31:10.20 --> 01:31:15.24 and you go yeah the boss sucks that's actually not the right thing to do right you don't want to
01:31:15.24 --> 01:31:21.000 disparage your boss what you want to say is you know you want it but you don't want to say no the
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.24 boss is awesome because now you're at enemies right but when the person says oh the boss sucks
01:31:28.04 --> 01:31:32.68 and you say you know I'm not really sure where they're making this decision from oh okay we're now
01:31:32.68 --> 01:31:35.88 you're talking about a decision so you're you're giving them a little bit of reflection but you're
01:31:35.88 --> 01:31:39.08 diminishing a little bit so you can have a real conversation about what's going on yeah
01:31:39.08 --> 01:31:47.08 yeah yeah so there's a certain scenario that that is comes up a lot this scenario literally means
01:31:47.08 --> 01:31:51.72 nothing at the end of the day so I knew I'll get the other one in my life I'll get these from time to
01:31:51.72 --> 01:32:00.12 time where so for example my way like many ways watch reality TV from time to time and you know
01:32:00.12 --> 01:32:05.72 it's the real housewives of this or married to medicine or whatever right these these are TV shows
01:32:05.72 --> 01:32:11.88 TV shows and they're like the depends on your opinion but you know they're in my opinion
01:32:12.52 --> 01:32:17.48 one of the most like the lamest type of show but whatever it's real these girls they throw them together
01:32:17.48 --> 01:32:21.48 and they're all rich and super immature and doing dumb stuff and yelling and blah blah blah
01:32:21.48 --> 01:32:28.36 sounds like awesome no great team problem so but here's the thing you know when there's like
01:32:28.36 --> 01:32:32.36 it's sort of you know when we're just sort of cruising relaxing and whatever and it's on
01:32:32.36 --> 01:32:38.92 this is what I used to do back in the day where I'd be like like what is this show is done
01:32:38.92 --> 01:32:45.64 like this is just being a you disparage her the thing that she likes right and I mean that's not
01:32:45.64 --> 01:32:52.28 what I mean which means you're disparaging her oh yeah but I didn't mean to do that I'm more like
01:32:52.28 --> 01:32:56.76 I'm talking about the show you know you're just being truthful exactly right you know you're just using
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:03.48 radical camera exactly but meanwhile she'd get I mean she wouldn't get mad but everyone's
01:33:03.48 --> 01:33:07.72 well she'd be like hey just leave it alone you know like I don't you know talk trash about your
01:33:07.72 --> 01:33:12.36 shows you know I don't give you she's like I don't insult you you know about your shows or whatever
01:33:12.36 --> 01:33:17.64 meanwhile I'm thinking like keeping my net sometimes watch my giver and these steps of shows
01:33:17.64 --> 01:33:22.52 right so I don't really have much of a leg to stand on but in my head I'm like yeah because
01:33:22.52 --> 01:33:28.20 my shows are awesome kind of thing you know and the thing is I'm not doing anything to her I'm
01:33:28.20 --> 01:33:32.28 talking about the show you know kind of thing but just like I said it's like I'm disparaging her
01:33:32.28 --> 01:33:39.72 taste and show her choices like basically all that sort of whole thing so so I started to realize
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:45.08 that or whatever so I did the whole reflect no diminish because it's meaningless the show and
01:33:45.08 --> 01:33:49.16 it's mean like I can disparage her show and her all or which is still gonna like the show you know
01:33:49.16 --> 01:33:54.44 it's not like she bases her life on it this is literally meaningless so now she'd be like oh my gosh
01:33:54.44 --> 01:33:58.44 I can't believe like this lady did that I'm in the room so of course it could literally be a cat in
01:33:58.44 --> 01:34:02.44 the room she probably say the same thing like she's just saying it to someone right so I can't
01:34:02.44 --> 01:34:06.04 believe I can't believe she did this and she'll like rewind it or whatever but I can't yeah
01:34:06.04 --> 01:34:10.84 yeah she's so stupid like kind of like I'm into the show you know everyone's on all show
01:34:10.84 --> 01:34:15.000 catch it she'd be like you don't like this show whatever but and the things I don't but it's
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.40 kind of fun to do and at the same time it's like considered the difference you know consider the
01:34:19.40 --> 01:34:23.24 difference would be saying oh my gosh don't you don't rewind it I don't care about that's you know
01:34:23.24 --> 01:34:29.16 so it's like that kind of stuff as well man we're it's like you kind of look at in you look at
01:34:29.16 --> 01:34:35.72 the whole situation as far as like the big picture you know where's like did do I do I make it a
01:34:35.72 --> 01:34:48.52 point to make a point right now yeah that question for you yeah so when you look broadly what's what's
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:58.04 like your most valuable thing that you've kind of adopted into your life since we started recording
01:34:58.04 --> 01:35:03.40 this podcast okay there's there at first there's one but there's two things and they might play
01:35:03.40 --> 01:35:09.40 off each other I guess but the main one is the long game versus the short game and and you said that
01:35:09.40 --> 01:35:15.48 to me early on that I was like I wouldn't never thought of that given what you said it about back then
01:35:16.36 --> 01:35:21.40 but the long game versus the short game so I can so that stuck in my head and since then I realize
01:35:21.40 --> 01:35:24.92 every little move you make literally like in life I don't care if it's like you're going to
01:35:24.92 --> 01:35:30.52 store to go buy some I don't know paper towels or something like there's always a long game
01:35:30.52 --> 01:35:35.80 in a short game in play right now so anything and if you think about it anything that you're successful at
01:35:35.80 --> 01:35:39.96 it's like you you're at least playing the long game some things in life people just aren't even playing the
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:44.04 game they're just going to minute to minute you know and that's a that's short play short you know
01:35:44.04 --> 01:35:52.44 you know you you caught this at one of the monsters a guy asked how often are you thinking strategically
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:57.08 which thinking strategically is thinking the long game and you you caught a clip of me getting a little bit
01:35:57.08 --> 01:36:04.04 fired up of saying you know I'm thinking strategically all the time that's let and that's the truth
01:36:04.04 --> 01:36:11.32 that is the way you should look at every decision that you make why would you make a decision based
01:36:11.32 --> 01:36:17.32 on the short term outcome being positive if it if it has a negative long term effect you just
01:36:17.32 --> 01:36:25.16 shouldn't do that you gotta play the long game and I'll tell you like I am thinking strategically
01:36:25.16 --> 01:36:37.64 all the time and that is so beneficial it's so beneficial in everything that you do and yet it's
01:36:37.64 --> 01:36:43.000 easy to get suckered in to make short term decisions based on short term gratification based on the
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.88 ease of movement based on the path of least resistance based on what's going to feel good right now
01:36:47.88 --> 01:36:55.88 based on even what's going to produce good results right now look we hope that our immediate results
01:36:55.88 --> 01:36:59.88 are aligned with our long term results and something that benefits us right now will benefit
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:06.12 benefits in the long run that's a great opportunity that does happen sometimes but sometimes
01:37:07.48 --> 01:37:14.20 oftentimes short term gains will result in long term losses so you gotta think through this
01:37:14.20 --> 01:37:21.80 in everything that you do yeah and I remember one when that guy asked that question and I
01:37:21.80 --> 01:37:27.72 remember thinking to myself that that's interesting kind of became clear why that's not so obvious
01:37:27.72 --> 01:37:32.12 and there's obvious reasons why it's not for sure because when he asked the question he's like
01:37:32.12 --> 01:37:37.000 how because even when you put it in those terms like strategic versus tactical right tactical is the
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.40 short term game strategic is a long term even so when you put when you use those specific words like
01:37:43.40 --> 01:37:49.24 hey so how often are you thinking strategic it's almost like it gives this feeling it's a feeling
01:37:49.24 --> 01:37:54.76 that you're like plotting you know often are you plotting meaning you have a certain plot in my
01:37:54.76 --> 01:38:01.000 you know like but it doesn't mean that like that's one maybe possible way of seeing it but
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.20 I don't I'm not talking about that like everything is like a game like you're moving through life you know
01:38:06.20 --> 01:38:12.20 so what where's your aim going to kind of sort of be and those those aims those goals for
01:38:12.20 --> 01:38:16.20 lack of better term or literally everything you do like you otherwise why what are you
01:38:16.20 --> 01:38:20.04 even doing why would you even move a muscle you know if you don't have like an aim to do it or whatever
01:38:20.92 --> 01:38:25.000 and that aim is going to be either long term or short term can be both for sure and that's like
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:32.36 the that's that's rare but that's really good opportunity as you put it but even if like you
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.44 stand it like you're sitting there right not moving a muscle right we'll say it's going to
01:38:36.44 --> 01:38:42.52 extreme example and you're like okay I got to move a muscle right maybe because I'm getting
01:38:42.52 --> 01:38:48.84 stiff or whatever there's always some like goal that you got to sort of achieve and if you look at
01:38:48.84 --> 01:38:53.40 everything like that and you consider okay what what's the ultimate outcome that I want you know
01:38:53.40 --> 01:38:59.32 and you could just keep that in mind man that is like a life life changing thing when you can really
01:38:59.32 --> 01:39:05.80 understand that I think that is a good one another thing that I told a story when hit one time
01:39:05.80 --> 01:39:09.32 on this podcast and you mentioned it to me I was talking about how when I was young I was in a
01:39:09.32 --> 01:39:16.12 seal butoon and I was thinking I was awesome and all of a sudden like other guys were getting promoted
01:39:16.12 --> 01:39:22.04 other guys were moving into better positions than me and I I've kind of looked at myself and I said
01:39:22.04 --> 01:39:32.28 if you're so smart then why are you winning and that was a big step for me to come to that realization
01:39:32.28 --> 01:39:40.28 and and what's good about it is that's another kind of early indicator of taking ownership
01:39:40.28 --> 01:39:44.84 because instead of me saying look I'm smart and I'm not winning because everyone else is against
01:39:44.84 --> 01:39:48.84 me because this guy's that and this guy's an ass kisser and this guy you know all that
01:39:48.84 --> 01:39:52.92 could have done that instead I looked at myself and said wait a second if you're so smart
01:39:52.92 --> 01:39:56.44 and luckily for me some of the guys around me were good guys they were my friends they I knew
01:39:56.44 --> 01:40:01.56 that they I couldn't blame anything on them but if I was so smart why wasn't I winning yeah
01:40:01.56 --> 01:40:06.60 that's the other thing that oh that's the other that's the other hundred percent and you know you
01:40:06.60 --> 01:40:10.92 see it in people and like like a lot of these things just like extreme ownership like you can see it
01:40:10.92 --> 01:40:16.84 in other people super clear you know like it's talking a lot of trash for being a loser you know
01:40:16.84 --> 01:40:20.76 kind of thing you know like you know the old thing where it's like oh yeah I'm getting this guy's
01:40:20.76 --> 01:40:25.56 giving me a relationship advice when he's like a single person you know he doesn't have a successful
01:40:25.56 --> 01:40:29.64 relationship or whatever you know it's like that kind of stuff you super easy to see that in other
01:40:29.64 --> 01:40:34.60 people but for yourself it's like yeah man I have this cool idea that you probably got from someone
01:40:34.60 --> 01:40:39.48 else or whatever and you have this quite doing you're so quick to be to tell people about it and
01:40:39.48 --> 01:40:43.96 to correct this person you know because it's so obvious they're doing it wrong right so you're
01:40:43.96 --> 01:40:47.96 gonna correct them and boom boom and you have your arguments and debates all like formulated
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:53.72 perfectly we ain't any debate meanwhile you're not doing anything you know you're just like sort of
01:40:53.72 --> 01:41:00.52 it so that is a big deal like what I realized that that's a huge deal like it and it's way
01:41:00.52 --> 01:41:04.68 better just to be quiet man you got it and it kind of like how you guys talk about it the monster
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:11.16 you didn't date broke they'll go deal they you'll talk about like taking action right so it's
01:41:11.16 --> 01:41:15.16 like taking action part is like the hardest part of whatever right it's like the guy who goes to school
01:41:15.72 --> 01:41:19.64 so much so much and then he's like but he can't really function the real world because his whole
01:41:19.64 --> 01:41:25.88 focus is on coin a school or the person watching like a bunch of motivational videos and he's just
01:41:25.88 --> 01:41:29.32 all he's motivated to do is watch more motivation videos you know he doesn't take any action
01:41:29.32 --> 01:41:35.96 whatever you get dopamine from a one motivational video do I just do people yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:41:35.96 --> 01:41:39.16 so that's that's what that's what makes him gonna want want to go watch another one
01:41:39.16 --> 01:41:45.000 what's more yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they're like two things you know like two separate separate things
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:54.68 but nonetheless it it kind of brings all that into perspective you know like you you if you're not
01:41:54.68 --> 01:41:59.32 you know if you're so smart why aren't you winning so the why aren't you winning part that's the
01:41:59.32 --> 01:42:03.24 most important part you know like it's almost like brown who cares how smart that person is
01:42:03.24 --> 01:42:09.08 you ever ever hear someone hate on someone like oh they're just dumb or whatever like uh who's the one
01:42:09.08 --> 01:42:15.24 the uh the kind of Kim Kardashian right you know people hate on her they're like I'm not even saying
01:42:15.24 --> 01:42:18.76 necessarily that I feel this way but I'm saying this is what plays out a lot of times they'll hate on
01:42:18.76 --> 01:42:24.20 her she's so dumb and they're so dumb or whatever and then it's like all right but if you're so
01:42:24.20 --> 01:42:29.40 not dumb like why is she like winning you know you're sort of not you know kind of thing it's like
01:42:29.40 --> 01:42:35.80 that whole idea is there is got put into perspective very much so it's like that's always on
01:42:35.80 --> 01:42:40.12 my mind too like before it opened my mouth or whatever it's like probably before you open your mouth you
01:42:40.12 --> 01:42:46.04 should really work on a bunch of stuff first you see what I'm saying so that's a big one and it
01:42:46.04 --> 01:42:51.48 helps a lot too because you start to focus on doing rather than blabbing you know and play and I don't
01:42:51.48 --> 01:42:56.44 mean just blabbing I mean everywhere like on social media all these people having their strong opinions
01:42:56.44 --> 01:43:03.32 you know it's crazy you know I you know I I I see that happen right um you know like I when I was
01:43:03.32 --> 01:43:12.44 on with Joe Rogan and Tulsi Gabbard you know obviously there's she's a she's literally running
01:43:12.44 --> 01:43:18.12 for president United States from America okay cool and there's obviously we we touched on we didn't
01:43:18.12 --> 01:43:24.04 really have a debate by any stretch I mean we we both kind we both kind of talked about things and we
01:43:24.04 --> 01:43:30.84 all kind of talked about things as human beings that were whatever you know it's pretty straightforward right
01:43:30.84 --> 01:43:40.36 but the the conversations that took place on Twitter after that I mean we're talking just I was
01:43:41.72 --> 01:43:49.56 I was like man is this the best place for this random person to have this major debate with some
01:43:49.56 --> 01:43:59.80 other random person about whatever topic had come up that was either you know they didn't agree
01:43:59.80 --> 01:44:09.96 with or they agreed with so that's a little crazy sometimes oh yeah huge I I hear people say you know
01:44:09.96 --> 01:44:19.32 that Twitter is just the most horrible thing to participate in right and I don't really think
01:44:19.32 --> 01:44:24.20 it's a horrible thing in fact I've gotten great interactions on Twitter I've gotten incredible
01:44:24.20 --> 01:44:31.88 feedback of met people I mean the whole reason that I was on with Joe and Tulsi was because of
01:44:31.88 --> 01:44:37.000 Twitter but books I've linked up with people we've had people on the podcast that I never would have
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.76 heard of or never would have been an introduced to that that are American heroes that have
01:44:42.76 --> 01:44:47.48 incredible stories that that's all through Twitter I've gotten great feedback I've gotten adjustments
01:44:47.48 --> 01:44:53.08 I've gotten correct so that's all good but yeah if you're gonna go down the whole of like hey let's
01:44:53.08 --> 01:45:10.60 debate this hot controversial topic you know it's hard for me to to to to reflect on that in a positive way
01:45:11.40 --> 01:45:16.60 you know it's a card for me to look at someone go man this is what you you know you just
01:45:16.60 --> 01:45:23.80 sent out nine tweets like linked here you can link tweets together and someone will send out nine tweets
01:45:23.80 --> 01:45:30.60 about some topic and it just worries me because I think there's more productive things that people
01:45:30.60 --> 01:45:36.44 could do with their time like if you want to put those things together and organize the way and
01:45:36.44 --> 01:45:41.64 you want to make those statements and and almost always they're attacking like in a super aggressive
01:45:41.64 --> 01:45:50.36 personal attack as well so anyways it's just interesting yeah it's a lot like the words say
01:45:50.36 --> 01:45:55.40 what they say but like the fact that those words are there like says a whole another thing you know
01:45:55.40 --> 01:46:01.88 you know the old nothing new where it's like man you don't have anything better to do
01:46:01.88 --> 01:46:06.68 than to like express and it's not like a lot any by any logical means they'd come to the conclusion
01:46:06.68 --> 01:46:11.40 that yeah what I say is gonna like solve whatever problem it is that I'm addressing it whatever like
01:46:11.40 --> 01:46:18.04 there's no reason to think that yeah I I guess I'm trying to think of a good metaphor
01:46:19.56 --> 01:46:27.56 for me this is like a metaphor if you saw someone that was having a that was shouting
01:46:28.60 --> 01:46:37.88 at a toilet at the top of their lungs and and they walk out of that stall kind of like
01:46:37.88 --> 01:46:43.88 you know kind of like yeah and and I'm thinking man you just you just yell because that's what
01:46:43.88 --> 01:46:47.64 that's what it is right you're yelling at a toilet because whoever doesn't want to listen you
01:46:47.64 --> 01:46:53.000 isn't even gonna read the little things that you wrote so what's once again that's why it's
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.16 more what's more important is like why not find some common ground with someone from a leadership
01:46:59.16 --> 01:47:03.16 from just from a leadership perspective right from a leadership ship perspective I want to find
01:47:03.16 --> 01:47:08.68 common ground with someone I want to figure out what it is that they think what their perspective is
01:47:08.68 --> 01:47:13.40 so that I can understand their perspective so that I can actually give them a logical
01:47:14.76 --> 01:47:20.44 argument or at least show them what I believe to be valid points so that they can then give me
01:47:20.44 --> 01:47:27.48 feedback on those points and I can learn from them and either adjust my position or adjust their
01:47:27.48 --> 01:47:33.32 position you can't get that done when you're yelling at a toilet which is a lot of people
01:47:33.32 --> 01:47:41.88 end up doing so yeah and also that reminds me as well another is a little bit more of a
01:47:41.88 --> 01:47:46.92 detail than anything but like how you how you do the old at the monsters you call it being a
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:52.28 tactical genius we just be quiet and let everyone else talk kind of thing and this like I find
01:47:52.28 --> 01:47:56.68 way more prevalent when I hear two people talk on their talking and they're debating and there's
01:47:56.68 --> 01:48:01.000 little differences and differences and then you can kind of you know like you're detached from
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.32 and right but you actively did that because man before I was strongly compelled to like jump in
01:48:07.32 --> 01:48:11.96 and like correct you you're wrong here and let me correct you right because I'm smart right
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:16.76 gotta prove it to these people I'm pretty I'm down for this whole thing I'm smart right so
01:48:16.76 --> 01:48:21.88 a soul quick to like jump in and be like yeah you know that's wrong or that's correct and let me
01:48:21.88 --> 01:48:25.96 expand on that kind of thing you know and it's fun to do you know it's all you know you're
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:30.12 having conversations whatever I dig it but there's a bigger picture you know so if you don't say
01:48:30.12 --> 01:48:34.04 anything you can see that bigger picture you can be like you know annoying you're being right
01:48:34.04 --> 01:48:38.44 like you're I think you're saying like truthful stuff or whatever but you're being there's a
01:48:38.44 --> 01:48:43.64 bigger picture with what you're doing so your tactics might be good your strategy is awful
01:48:43.64 --> 01:48:48.60 it's way wrong name is we you're gonna win this argument and you're gonna make this person
01:48:48.60 --> 01:48:53.48 dig in deeper that's what's gonna happen not to mention like you last yeah after this like you
01:48:53.48 --> 01:48:58.36 think you're impressing them with the and I'm thinking of like very specific conversations that
01:48:58.36 --> 01:49:03.64 I then remembering right now with whether be friends or whatever friend family but you kind of
01:49:03.64 --> 01:49:09.08 think to yourself man like I used to talk to my brother about this idea where it's like man what
01:49:09.08 --> 01:49:14.36 you're saying is correct in your little debate but brought what you're doing is wrong you know you can't
01:49:14.36 --> 01:49:21.16 do that or you can but you're gonna lose your war whatever so yeah so one of the things I learned
01:49:21.16 --> 01:49:27.08 that's just with me right now it's with me hardcore is just don't say anything just be the
01:49:27.08 --> 01:49:32.20 tactical genius so one they ask you or when they look at you or when you do for whatever like strategic
01:49:32.20 --> 01:49:40.76 reason want to chime in yeah you're like you're way more in a position of that you want to be in
01:49:40.76 --> 01:49:46.36 you know and you you don't run the risk of being all sucked in and alienating people and doing
01:49:46.36 --> 01:49:50.92 all the things that that you've run the risk of doing when you're you know trying to impress them
01:49:50.92 --> 01:49:56.52 with those smart you are and how good your position is you know all right so let's get to your
01:49:56.52 --> 01:50:04.20 black belt yes sir you were surprised yes we did a good job of keeping it under wraps yeah
01:50:04.60 --> 01:50:09.88 but had you at this point just surrendered to fact that you made we just were gonna be a brown belt
01:50:09.88 --> 01:50:15.56 for a really long time yeah and part of this part of it was like I'm glad I thought of it this way
01:50:15.56 --> 01:50:20.44 in part of it is like man I should you know you always think back on things like you should
01:50:20.44 --> 01:50:26.84 handle things or whatever so so moving up in ranks and and I say this kind in a way as it
01:50:26.84 --> 01:50:32.92 advice to maybe people who can fall into these psychological traps with the belt right they want
01:50:32.92 --> 01:50:36.84 to belt they want that stripe or the blue belt or the purple you know they want they want to get
01:50:36.84 --> 01:50:41.80 promoted right because they want to wear part of it is because they want to wear that belt and it
01:50:41.80 --> 01:50:47.16 doesn't keep in mind it does not help you just do doesn't help you just do this not that
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:52.60 currently does not help this particular situation where you know when and our school
01:50:52.60 --> 01:50:57.88 I like you're saying I thought you're saying it does not help like oh definitely like no no no
01:50:57.88 --> 01:51:02.04 I thought you're saying hey getting your black belt by the way it does not help your duty
01:51:02.04 --> 01:51:09.08 which I was like that's a great well I felt does not make your duty to any better nope it's a
01:51:09.08 --> 01:51:14.92 light even introduce the idea that it's not nearly as good as you thought it was but yes
01:51:14.92 --> 01:51:19.08 yeah I'll tell you about that too by the way but I'm saying the culture of duty to
01:51:19.08 --> 01:51:24.04 doesn't help your think your mindset about this especially like our school doesn't do this a lot
01:51:24.04 --> 01:51:27.80 where you know how they like everyone line up at the end or at the beginning class and it's like hey
01:51:27.80 --> 01:51:34.12 by belt you wipe out you go in the back on the back go suckers you know like you're a man sub
01:51:34.12 --> 01:51:40.44 human bread whatever you guys sandwiches oh yeah and oh the with a black belt not not even in the front
01:51:40.44 --> 01:51:46.36 room in front of every body facing them you know you guys bow down in front of us kind of thing right
01:51:46.36 --> 01:51:50.52 and then okay after your brown belt you're almost here so you can come close right everyone else in the
01:51:50.52 --> 01:51:56.44 back you know so it's like I dig it man I dig it does the duty to culture does not help but
01:51:56.44 --> 01:52:04.76 if you can kind of get past that this is how ideally I would have tried to think about it where
01:52:05.88 --> 01:52:11.56 you like okay so the belt doesn't matter okay so when I was coming up I didn't know there was belts
01:52:12.20 --> 01:52:17.40 like I didn't really know I watched UFC 1 2 3 4 or you know those ones and sure
01:52:17.40 --> 01:52:21.80 why's going to be wearing a belt but I joined no guedine so we don't wear belts therefore no belts
01:52:21.80 --> 01:52:27.56 I don't know I'm thinking back I didn't think about this but I think in that that's probably
01:52:27.56 --> 01:52:32.60 my subconscious thought so one day brand remember it was one of the trainers of whatever he was like
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:37.24 you guys are about white belts here and it was me and a group and I was like white belts it's like
01:52:37.24 --> 01:52:44.44 hmm I never thought of that you know so doing tournaments and competition and stuff like that
01:52:44.44 --> 01:52:51.40 after it was a year like 12 13 months right Jimmy remember Jimmy Santés right he was like hey
01:52:51.40 --> 01:52:56.92 come to class tomorrow and I was like I think now I can't come tomorrow at it was at six or whatever
01:52:56.92 --> 01:53:03.64 I work I work at night so I can't come and he was like no no come tomorrow come tomorrow you have to come tomorrow
01:53:03.64 --> 01:53:07.80 and I'm like I can't come tomorrow I don't know how else to tell you like I can't come tomorrow
01:53:07.80 --> 01:53:12.44 I'm not going to I mean he's like no no we're having promotions tomorrow
01:53:12.44 --> 01:53:17.96 so I'm like I'm thinking I'm not thinking belt promotions I don't know about that yet so
01:53:17.96 --> 01:53:23.64 he's like he's still didn't realize nope it had no idea and he and he goes uh he's like
01:53:23.64 --> 01:53:29.000 no we're having promotions but I'm thinking you know how like promotions like a tap out is coming in
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.04 to promote that brand and it's like a show and you can't imagine promotion that's what I'm thinking
01:53:34.04 --> 01:53:38.44 so and everyone comes and it's a fun thing I thought it was like a team thing or something and I'm like
01:53:38.44 --> 01:53:43.32 that's cool and I if man if I didn't work that'd be cool and I would it can he say pro
01:53:43.96 --> 01:53:47.80 it's like what I got it to I think you're getting because you're getting promoted tomorrow to blue belt
01:53:48.28 --> 01:53:53.000 now it's like oh blue belt because I never were gay before I was on nogie so it just didn't
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.04 don't mean so it's like okay that was only after like 13 months or whatever so I was just focused on
01:53:58.04 --> 01:54:01.56 training and learning cool new moves and oh my gosh I can do this now and all that you know
01:54:02.20 --> 01:54:05.56 getting better and that's what I was focused on learning and stuff so then I got a blue belt's like
01:54:05.56 --> 01:54:11.80 cool but still nogie I was competing so it's like the belt never really I'm just I just want to win
01:54:11.80 --> 01:54:15.48 I just want to get better and win because if I don't win I lose tournaments and that part sucks
01:54:15.48 --> 01:54:22.04 doesn't matter what don't plus nogie like I said it's it's not belt driven it's you know time so
01:54:22.84 --> 01:54:26.92 and then I got purple belt like another year like super fast and it was like a surprise it was like
01:54:26.92 --> 01:54:32.68 a liaisu's there joltutor was there it was like rolling and I did a little bit of ghee at this time
01:54:32.68 --> 01:54:36.44 and I was doing ghee and then alias just pass out of purple belt and he's like giving it to me
01:54:36.44 --> 01:54:43.32 whatever and I was like oh this is pretty kind of surprising and kind of crazy but I started to do more
01:54:43.32 --> 01:54:49.24 ghee and then I got hurt like at the end of purple belt and you know people were starting to look
01:54:49.24 --> 01:54:52.60 at me like hey when are you getting to get your brown belt then it started getting introduced to me
01:54:53.24 --> 01:54:59.24 so then my mindset kind of started to shift then I stopped competing too so now like just competing
01:54:59.24 --> 01:55:04.28 to win wasn't really part of it it was it was of all about walking in the training room or this
01:55:04.28 --> 01:55:09.96 corrupting the moment into my mind so walking the training room you know I'm a purple belt but
01:55:09.96 --> 01:55:14.36 I've been a purple belt for a while so like I want to be a brown belt well I'm better than that guy
01:55:14.36 --> 01:55:19.16 you know like I got that guy out I should be I should be wearing the brown belt standing up front
01:55:19.16 --> 01:55:24.20 little bit more you know it's that starts to creep in meanwhile all the stuff that got
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:27.88 got you there you know like focusing on like learning new moves getting better at your moves
01:55:27.88 --> 01:55:33.000 and and being effective or whatever that is like sort of secondary you know you kind of focus like
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.20 oh my instructors here now let me um I better not get caught I better not experiment I better like
01:55:38.20 --> 01:55:44.28 show them I'm good you know it's like that and it jams you up so and then not to mention the frustration
01:55:44.28 --> 01:55:48.84 when it doesn't happen day after day we get after week and don't let there be a promotion and you
01:55:48.84 --> 01:55:55.80 not get promoted harsh man harsh luckily that never happened to me but like I seen people like
01:55:55.80 --> 01:56:00.52 behaving ways that you should never be even due to after that happens to you know the kind
01:56:00.52 --> 01:56:06.28 like a promotion goes on and when we get promoted and they don't so anyway but I so I can
01:56:06.28 --> 01:56:12.36 imagine the feeling right and then it and it jams me up I felt like my learning just didn't
01:56:12.36 --> 01:56:18.28 would like I plateaued like pretty hardcore what year is this this is like end of purple belt
01:56:18.28 --> 01:56:27.48 which what year is that I got brought my brown belt in 12 2012 okay so there is that um and then you
01:56:27.48 --> 01:56:32.12 know after you kind of get promoted then everything starts to come into perspective you know like
01:56:32.12 --> 01:56:35.96 man I shouldn't waste my time thinking like that all this up but you're kind of easy now that you
01:56:35.96 --> 01:56:40.04 have the brown belt that you wanted the whole time kind of thing right so you kind of let it go
01:56:41.24 --> 01:56:45.48 and then especially because brown belt is kind of legit like I mean brown belt
01:56:45.48 --> 01:56:55.56 is legit like you're a complete you know yeah you're you're it's it's a real thing yeah it's
01:56:55.56 --> 01:57:01.96 I think you're seriously in the game yes you have game yes like you can technically be a
01:57:01.96 --> 01:57:06.44 purple belt and really maybe not have that great I mean look there's purple belt out there
01:57:06.44 --> 01:57:13.56 that are murderers for sure but you can you can be a purple belt me like you know and of
01:57:13.56 --> 01:57:21.08 course there's cases where this is completely untrue but usually a brown belt is legit like 90
01:57:21.88 --> 01:57:27.88 I guess for every belt it goes up like a percentage of what the what the how legit
01:57:28.52 --> 01:57:33.24 what the chances are that this person is totally legit and it has really good due to
01:57:33.24 --> 01:57:36.76 I brown belt there's a really high probability that you're legit and you have really good
01:57:36.76 --> 01:57:41.08 due to yeah that's a good way of putting it where it's like for every because it's it always
01:57:41.08 --> 01:57:47.72 feels that way when you're a white belt and you get promoted to blue belt you're like man that's
01:57:47.72 --> 01:57:53.000 like that's a big huge deal and then when you get promoted to purple belt it's so much of a bigger
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.56 deal that it's like oh my blue belt promotion was awesome but like nothing compared to this
01:57:57.56 --> 01:58:02.92 purple belt and then purple belt to brown is almost like you're becoming an adult kind of thing
01:58:02.92 --> 01:58:08.44 you know so it's like way bigger it's like cool purple belt but brown belt you know and then of
01:58:08.44 --> 01:58:13.80 course brown belt the black belt's even bigger you know plus is like an added little thing to the
01:58:13.80 --> 01:58:19.08 black belt but so you know it's easier to have clear thoughts on that and add a little thing
01:58:19.08 --> 01:58:25.24 to the black belt yeah well you get to stand up front and face the people now you know seems
01:58:25.24 --> 01:58:30.84 so that's the thing there's a lot one thing is when you're a black belt now the percentage of
01:58:30.84 --> 01:58:36.60 people that are that that that don't really have good due to that our black belt is very very small
01:58:36.60 --> 01:58:43.32 yeah it's very very small having a black belt in 22 means there's a 99% chance that you are
01:58:43.32 --> 01:58:47.64 good at due to yeah because there's some people that whatever I don't even know where they got
01:58:47.64 --> 01:58:51.72 their belts from or whatever because what I don't want to do is just blank it say everyone that's a
01:58:51.72 --> 01:58:56.60 black belt is awesome because that's not true right yeah but there's a really good chance
01:58:56.60 --> 01:59:02.04 that you got some good due to it's a real black belt yeah fully and so anyway the so the point
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:07.72 and then I never really ran into that at Brown Belt even though I was a brown belt for a long
01:59:07.72 --> 01:59:12.76 time like seven years I was a brown belt that was more because I had like career and I let myself
01:59:12.76 --> 01:59:17.72 like not focus on Gigi too you know for a while then you know I got hurt again like all this
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:21.64 all this stuff you know who was always campaigning for you to get your black belt
01:59:21.64 --> 01:59:30.36 who Greg Train yeah okay yeah yeah no he would and he's your your the guy that he'd be like hey
01:59:30.36 --> 01:59:36.28 right okay okay that's feeling good and I go yeah yeah and he's the that's the classic that's
01:59:36.28 --> 01:59:40.44 where my joke came from is Wendy you think he should get his black belt and I got her on probably
01:59:40.44 --> 01:59:45.80 another six months and then he probably asked me that five times you know for two years for two
01:59:45.80 --> 01:59:50.36 years yeah maybe even longer he was like hey what do you think I'm gonna be and then honestly part of
01:59:50.36 --> 01:59:56.28 it was you'd get hurt yeah you got you got hurt it's really bad timing to get hurt yeah meaning
01:59:56.28 --> 02:00:01.72 it was really close like okay we you know it's like okay we're almost an eye person was
02:00:01.72 --> 02:00:08.04 almost in the planning stages of like okay time to give him his black belt yeah and that I
02:00:08.04 --> 02:00:12.04 probably reached that planning phase I might have reached that planning phase I don't know if you've
02:00:12.04 --> 02:00:19.72 been hurt three times there they're a bit there well major injury was by at Brown Belt by
02:00:19.72 --> 02:00:26.20 Sep my knee I was out for a while just probably my by some of the way and as far as her injuries go yeah okay
02:00:26.20 --> 02:00:32.12 so there's probably two times in there where it was I was probably in the planning phase of okay
02:00:32.12 --> 02:00:36.28 we need to make this happen yeah and when you get hurt I'd be like well not happening now yeah you
02:00:36.28 --> 02:00:41.32 know it's what I guess could be frustrating but I didn't feel it at the time when I was in
02:00:41.32 --> 02:00:47.40 that happened with purple belt as well because that day when I got hurt um Alias told me hey you
02:00:47.40 --> 02:00:52.36 got it I was really into nogie and no geek uh competition so I didn't want to do the
02:00:52.36 --> 02:00:55.80 geek part of it that was like an all-day competition they'd be in the day and then no
02:00:55.80 --> 02:01:01.72 get night and uh Alias was like hey do the geek part of it and I was like no no that's not
02:01:01.72 --> 02:01:06.20 where my goals lie you know giving the speeches like no you should really do the gear it'll
02:01:06.20 --> 02:01:09.88 help your game all this stuff like I've been like cool man I respect you and you're the man but
02:01:10.60 --> 02:01:14.36 my goals don't look you know giving them this sort of technical speech and he's like
02:01:14.36 --> 02:01:21.24 kind of like how Jamie did me long time ago he's like bro do the geek because this geek competition
02:01:21.24 --> 02:01:26.04 is your brown belt test straight up told me because he wanted to just tell me like cool one I
02:01:26.04 --> 02:01:33.72 won the purple belt got hurt in the nogie no purple belt years and years and years ago by
02:01:34.36 --> 02:01:38.68 no purple belt so same deal man like right before that was he told you brown belt or purple belt
02:01:38.68 --> 02:01:43.88 I was a purple belt that was the that geek competition yeah so he didn't say if I won there he just said
02:01:43.88 --> 02:01:49.000 that's your test for to get your brown belt yeah you just changed it to to a purple belt when you
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.56 re-till the story so yeah got it yeah so that was the test um and yeah that's no promotion yeah
02:01:55.56 --> 02:02:01.56 because they got hurt so same deal but it's yeah that's part of the game but in brown in brown
02:02:01.56 --> 02:02:04.92 belt even though it was longer time and you know what how that I'm thinking of it and I had to
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:11.16 stop before you the the the the the introduction and I guess wasn't an introduction but the introduction
02:02:11.16 --> 02:02:19.08 of you taking a little bit more like control over what belt I had like one route um I don't know
02:02:19.08 --> 02:02:25.32 when exactly that was but there is a time where I'm where I'm thinking in fact someone even told me
02:02:26.04 --> 02:02:30.04 maybe told someone who eventually told me that like oh yeah they're gonna throw a
02:02:30.04 --> 02:02:35.72 brown belt but jockel standing in the way like jockel won't let it happen like the kind deen was said like
02:02:35.72 --> 02:02:41.88 okay and jockel was like no that's what someone told me that's a little bit of a that my little bit
02:02:43.16 --> 02:02:47.96 I mean the bottom line is we we have a pretty actually someone did tell me that exact thing
02:02:47.96 --> 02:02:53.96 and I know who it is it doesn't matter pretty pretty democratic promotional system here because we
02:02:53.96 --> 02:03:00.92 have so many black belts everybody knows different sides of people's games so generally there'll
02:03:00.92 --> 02:03:06.28 be like a hey what do you think I mean for the lower belts it's sort of you know the individual
02:03:06.28 --> 02:03:10.20 black belt so we like hey I'm promoted this guy this guy but when it comes to black belt
02:03:10.84 --> 02:03:18.60 there's gonna be some consensus yeah now I will say I am probably the biggest hurdle when it comes
02:03:18.60 --> 02:03:26.36 to black belt right because it's a big deal so I'm not over your thrown out black belts on people
02:03:26.36 --> 02:03:33.56 and going yep yep good to go so yeah I mean there were sometimes I don't you know whether I was the
02:03:33.56 --> 02:03:38.68 only guy standing in the way and part of it is just the whole dynamics of the situation which is
02:03:39.80 --> 02:03:44.76 you know someone throws it out there not like hey I think but someone being like hey you think
02:03:44.76 --> 02:03:50.68 echo is ready my standard answer is gonna be like no it's not ready probably like six months right
02:03:50.68 --> 02:03:57.16 probably pretty standard answer whether that was you or whoever so yeah there's probably some
02:03:57.56 --> 02:04:07.32 facts to me being the roadblock yeah but not because not because I was like I don't want to give
02:04:07.32 --> 02:04:13.64 echo his black belt that's what wasn't in it all it's like I want echo to be to deserve
02:04:13.64 --> 02:04:20.60 his black belt yeah right that's what I always felt too and I was ready yeah we'll put simply
02:04:20.60 --> 02:04:26.20 you had a specific standard that was in a that was not a flimsy standard that was like for the
02:04:26.20 --> 02:04:33.16 the real deal and I saw I figured that and with varying levels and mixed emotions about that
02:04:33.16 --> 02:04:38.44 because you know the image or sight of me is like man just let it go bro you know like
02:04:38.44 --> 02:04:43.40 way gotta be such a hard ass all the time kind of attitude and then the other side is like man the
02:04:43.40 --> 02:04:49.88 it's almost like logical where man who would you rather be like a medium or not so good black
02:04:49.88 --> 02:04:55.56 belt or like the best brown belt like who would you what as far as that kind of thinking goes
02:04:55.56 --> 02:05:00.20 in this thing and I'd rather be the good brown belt really you know because you're rolling
02:05:00.20 --> 02:05:03.32 a row with your butt like everyone knows the black belt is not that good you know and you
02:05:03.32 --> 02:05:06.52 don't want to be that guy it's free if you think if you're thinking like that you know so it's
02:05:06.52 --> 02:05:11.40 like you know I I get it I make sense and then of course if you can get to the maturity level
02:05:11.40 --> 02:05:16.20 to think well when it if it does happen I'm gonna be so happy that it happened this way if you
02:05:16.20 --> 02:05:19.96 can get there then it's like okay that'll make you feel better too and that's again if you're
02:05:19.96 --> 02:05:25.80 even focusing on that belt that belt situation so when I even thought about it and when I'd
02:05:25.80 --> 02:05:29.80 hear all this stuff that like yeah like these people want to like promote you but then jockel
02:05:29.80 --> 02:05:36.20 like doesn't you know kind of thing then I'd be then that when I think about it'd be like I think
02:05:36.20 --> 02:05:42.52 to myself yeah I'd basically have to tap jockel out like not even wants to like the kind
02:05:42.52 --> 02:05:47.32 like I'd have to I'd have to tap a lot of few times for him to like consider giving me that's
02:05:47.32 --> 02:05:53.24 what I just figured you just kind of got to that place yeah so that was it and then so it's in a way
02:05:53.24 --> 02:05:59.000 it's easy to to get or it made it easier for me to not even focus on it anymore it's kind of like
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:02.92 did you tap about jockel to you no okay then let's move on kind of thing in your own mind you know
02:06:03.64 --> 02:06:07.80 but let's say let's say I did tap you out though that would throw me right back into the downward
02:06:07.80 --> 02:06:13.08 spiral focusing on belt so that's kind of the van you want to think you like that so eventually
02:06:13.08 --> 02:06:17.40 I came to the conclusion this is probably like leading up like the the months or year maybe
02:06:17.40 --> 02:06:23.08 leading up to it is like jockel might keep me a black belt when he's on his deathbed and
02:06:23.08 --> 02:06:27.88 do we're done with his life and or he's done with his life hopefully I don't dive you for him and
02:06:27.88 --> 02:06:34.12 he'll be there oh by the way you know give boom I have a black belt and I for real had that thought
02:06:34.12 --> 02:06:40.20 like whatever and I'm like okay he's holding up for a little while too okay I got to tap him
02:06:40.20 --> 02:06:44.20 out before he's gonna give it to me okay so he's just now I'm never gonna get it never yeah
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:51.24 and keep in mind I'm not thinking this every single day I'm saying when I did think about that
02:06:51.24 --> 02:06:54.28 or when people would be like hey when are you gonna get in your belt or your black belt or
02:06:54.28 --> 02:06:59.24 what are those are the thoughts I was going my mind you know this was years ago I had a conversation
02:06:59.24 --> 02:07:03.96 with James Nielsen about this because I forget who we were looking at promoting to black belt
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:10.12 but I was like yeah you know maybe in like six months and then they were like you know James was like
02:07:10.12 --> 02:07:18.36 bro he's good or she's good and I was like yeah and I I think I said like hey that person's never
02:07:18.36 --> 02:07:23.64 even passed my guard before right you know it might even be meant about you but I don't think it was I think
02:07:23.64 --> 02:07:28.12 it was an earlier black belt I think it was maybe like Craig or someone in that group
02:07:29.56 --> 02:07:38.68 and James is like hey we're much better than we were when we got our black belts which is so
02:07:39.48 --> 02:07:44.12 you know I got my black belt a long time ago right 2005
02:07:44.12 --> 02:07:50.04 2000 right before I right so that's like what 14 years ago so 14 years ago
02:07:51.48 --> 02:07:56.52 I I've had my black belt for 14 years so how much better I've done so much training
02:07:56.52 --> 02:08:01.16 I mean I've done more training as a black belt than I did without a black belt for sure
02:08:01.16 --> 02:08:06.52 and high level training so you can't think oh I can't compare you
02:08:06.52 --> 02:08:14.20 because I mean the same thing right if I held the standard of you of like well Echo's never
02:08:14.20 --> 02:08:17.64 tapped me out so I'm never going I'm given this black belt when he touched him up that's an unfair
02:08:17.64 --> 02:08:24.68 standard because I'm way better than I was 14 years ago when I got my black belt so that's not a fair
02:08:24.68 --> 02:08:32.84 standard so yeah that's that's not a good but it's not a good couple so in that way because like
02:08:32.84 --> 02:08:39.80 there are certain people where it's like like Andy for example he his skill rose so fast that
02:08:39.80 --> 02:08:43.88 away I mean did he has he ever tapped you up before he got his black belt?
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:52.04 I think he did I think he got me I think he got me like one time but I think it was like
02:08:52.04 --> 02:09:00.84 as a purple belt and it had no influence on a black belt okay it just seemed like with Andy and
02:09:00.84 --> 02:09:05.000 whether this was the case or I just seems like this could be a possibility in this type of equation
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.76 where they rise so fast and they get so good so fast that it's like bro like I have no choice
02:09:12.76 --> 02:09:16.92 but to give this guy a black belt sure he's straight up he's tapping me out and I've been a black
02:09:16.92 --> 02:09:21.64 belt for 15 years you know it's it's kind of like that kind of attitude but yeah so it's not like
02:09:21.64 --> 02:09:28.36 a apple samples to a street in the way I guess but but it's true though yeah you're right so I could
02:09:28.36 --> 02:09:33.08 I couldn't be like oh well well I'm just gonna have to wait until Echo taps me out to get his
02:09:33.08 --> 02:09:38.92 buck belt cuz when is that gonna happen right could it happen today sure it could happen today
02:09:39.72 --> 02:09:46.36 but you might not tap me out for another two years right I mean like that's that's the
02:09:46.36 --> 02:09:51.56 reality of the situation you might tap me out tonight right I make a mistake you get a good move
02:09:51.56 --> 02:09:59.16 it can happen but it might take a long time I mean there's people that have never tapped me out and
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.56 you know it just happens right like this it doesn't mean that they're not worthy of you know
02:10:05.56 --> 02:10:11.56 exact right doesn't mean that doesn't mean that so that's one of those things where I had to kind of
02:10:11.56 --> 02:10:18.04 recognize that you know we're better now than we were then but to counter that argument everyone's
02:10:18.04 --> 02:10:24.68 better now than we were then so probably a good purple belt right now would be able to beat me as
02:10:24.68 --> 02:10:31.24 a black belt 14 years ago right a modern purple belt a modern purple like do you watch the
02:10:31.24 --> 02:10:37.24 worlds did you I mean you watch kids at the worlds the the purple belts at the worlds are savages
02:10:37.24 --> 02:10:44.92 right when you compare them especially to a black belt from 14 years ago 14 years ago is a long
02:10:44.92 --> 02:10:55.72 time ago the game has evolved a lot but so you were not expecting it all when we were able to do that you
02:10:55.72 --> 02:11:01.32 know I so what I did was I ran it ran it because you were ready and I was like okay you know
02:11:01.32 --> 02:11:06.04 that goes that goes good ago you should be having this back but I will watch you roll that's another thing
02:11:06.04 --> 02:11:12.04 I would evaluate is how you roll with other people not just with me because that's not fair either right
02:11:12.04 --> 02:11:17.64 because how does your game match up with me not the best way you know and I would watch you roll with
02:11:17.64 --> 02:11:22.76 someone that's good with me and I'm like you're doing better against that person so then I got you
02:11:22.76 --> 02:11:28.20 know it's the same thing with everyone like you watch them rolling you got ah you know you should
02:11:28.84 --> 02:11:33.08 you're killing this person or you're killing that person you know you're not killing me
02:11:33.96 --> 02:11:38.60 that person's given me a hard time so therefore it's just your game doesn't match well with with me
02:11:38.60 --> 02:11:46.28 which doesn't mean that you're not ready this means it's a bad matchup yeah that's not linear like that
02:11:46.28 --> 02:11:54.68 for sure so yeah so it was awesome to have that go down I know it was a long haul we're not
02:11:54.68 --> 02:12:02.60 into making stuff easy we're on it okay so what's the future hold for echo Charles at this time
02:12:02.60 --> 02:12:11.48 up man for what for jiu jitsu the same I feel like it's like so jiu jitsu and thinking back on it
02:12:11.48 --> 02:12:16.92 and I kind of had these feelings even kind of coming up for 14 years where white belt you're just
02:12:16.92 --> 02:12:21.48 like I taught you're like toddler kindergarten you know kind of you know and then you get
02:12:21.48 --> 02:12:26.68 through blue belt and purple belt you're like you know elementary you know junior high high school
02:12:26.68 --> 02:12:32.76 and then uh brown belt is kind of like college you know you sort of feel like you're in adult
02:12:32.76 --> 02:12:37.80 and you're in there you can do some good things you know having impact on the world in college
02:12:37.80 --> 02:12:43.48 talk about college uh and then but you're just learn it's you should be learning in there and then
02:12:45.16 --> 02:12:49.16 then you get black belt is like you graduated from college now you got to go function in the
02:12:49.16 --> 02:12:55.16 real world now you know so it's like man in a way people say oh jiu jitsu just begins at black belt
02:12:55.16 --> 02:13:00.76 and yeah in that way it totally does and that's not to mention all the little superficial things that
02:13:00.76 --> 02:13:05.40 kind of come good and bad by the way they come with it like when you when you when you're a black
02:13:05.40 --> 02:13:09.40 belt take case so if you're not a black belt and you tap out a black belt that's a that's a
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:13.08 good feeling you know it's like one of those little things in your mind that you're like hey I
02:13:13.08 --> 02:13:17.56 tapped out a black belt before you know kind of thing so now you have that kind of
02:13:17.56 --> 02:13:22.12 target on your back if you want to put it that way um you're gonna give other people that good feeling
02:13:22.12 --> 02:13:27.000 yes you're a target for that so people you can tell people's attitude when they roll with you is
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.40 a little bit different well it might be an illusion but I feel like it's different like physically
02:13:33.40 --> 02:13:38.28 and then um that's not to mention like you know the stuff that maybe the other black belts might
02:13:38.28 --> 02:13:42.52 have like oh where could the black belt like I don't know if it's them expecting me to like
02:13:42.52 --> 02:13:46.84 I'm a black belt now so I'm gonna put it on you or what but everyone's a mile a few little
02:13:46.84 --> 02:13:52.12 something like all you you seem like this role means a little bit more now than it does before it's like I
02:13:52.12 --> 02:13:58.84 get that feeling sometimes just not all the time but there's that but yeah like how we're talking
02:13:58.84 --> 02:14:03.40 yesterday whatever it's like it doesn't really change anything you know like just goes with
02:14:03.40 --> 02:14:08.60 my belt happens to be a different color it's like you're as good as you are you know that doesn't
02:14:08.60 --> 02:14:16.36 make your ginger ginger game no sir it does not right the future yet not just keep training you know
02:14:16.36 --> 02:14:21.40 I guess I mean there's in most ways I feel like the pressure is sort of off and more so
02:14:21.40 --> 02:14:26.28 than it's off it's more like I don't I'm not susceptible to that that wacky way of thinking like oh
02:14:27.64 --> 02:14:33.80 when am I gonna you promote it oh did I did I perform well so Dean and Jocco saw you know
02:14:33.80 --> 02:14:38.04 the pressure that I feel which is a good pressure is like the when you're a black belt man you
02:14:38.04 --> 02:14:42.20 got a main tane yeah you got a main tane you got a train you got a main tane you don't want to be
02:14:42.20 --> 02:14:49.000 rolling you don't want to put a black belt on and not represent and not have the skills man 100%
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.16 so I mean that doesn't you're gonna win every time like there's people that are training
02:14:53.16 --> 02:14:58.28 more than you and you're doing stuff and it's like yeah but you should have black belt level
02:14:58.28 --> 02:15:05.32 skills yeah period in the story yeah period in the story and I think that that makes it in I guess it
02:15:05.32 --> 02:15:09.88 depends on what you mean but I I think that makes it easier for you like how you say it's good
02:15:09.88 --> 02:15:16.12 pressure it's like it's not even it's more of like it it's like it's like a cool little push you know
02:15:16.12 --> 02:15:20.92 like it's almost like um like you know these celebrities or whatever like an actor or something
02:15:20.92 --> 02:15:25.64 right where he he has to play Wolverine so he has to work out you know it's like but you got to be
02:15:25.64 --> 02:15:31.24 Wolverine on this movie so work out okay of course you know kind of thing rather than let's so you
02:15:31.24 --> 02:15:36.28 didn't have the movie but you still got to work out it's you know it's kind of different so yeah like
02:15:36.28 --> 02:15:41.72 training more and maintaining kind of the you know the standard or whatever and if you like it's
02:15:41.72 --> 02:15:49.08 like easier uh Akbar yeah for those of you that don't know Akbar he's this awesome fighter
02:15:49.08 --> 02:15:58.60 and crazy jujitsu um he was in he was you know he fought in the UFC never really you know he never
02:15:58.60 --> 02:16:03.64 performed to the level of his capability unfortunately you know he you know he's just incredibly
02:16:03.64 --> 02:16:10.36 skilled and he just didn't put it together right you know circumstances things happened you know
02:16:10.36 --> 02:16:14.52 his opponents did things that were good you know it's like that's the way it is but he did pretty good
02:16:14.52 --> 02:16:19.56 and you like yeah he did great he did great he did great had some cool stuff oh yeah he he's but anyways
02:16:20.20 --> 02:16:25.72 he's awesome to train with but like I always had a rule with him we had a rule with each other
02:16:26.44 --> 02:16:32.28 if it's you want if you want a train we're gonna train like so there's no because both of us kind of
02:16:32.28 --> 02:16:38.60 know it's gonna be a it's gonna be a crushing roll it's gonna be it's gonna be an early
02:16:38.60 --> 02:16:42.76 and you know we had the we had the rule at first it was an unwritten rule and then one day I just
02:16:42.76 --> 02:16:48.92 said I was like hey no matter what do you want a roll we're rolling it and he's like hey if you
02:16:48.92 --> 02:16:54.12 want a roll we're rolling yeah so he but he's he just he just like came start a training again
02:16:54.12 --> 02:16:59.96 yeah we're trying to be so savage yeah freaking hard work when he rolls he rolls oh yeah he's going for
02:16:59.96 --> 02:17:07.56 he's gonna bring it yeah yeah he's gonna bring it and uh videos you're gonna start making
02:17:07.56 --> 02:17:13.40 some more videos yeah you know videos hard because like especially now that videos are
02:17:14.60 --> 02:17:19.64 I don't know if you know if I told you this fully but like videos are so common now
02:17:19.64 --> 02:17:24.36 yeah that like back when I made the victory videos it was like yeah you were right in the
02:17:24.36 --> 02:17:28.36 head of your time wait yeah that's the thing and looking at him now you're like oh hold that's
02:17:28.36 --> 02:17:33.40 kind of cheesy kind of funny like fun they're like cool but it's like you can you can you
02:17:33.40 --> 02:17:38.60 should post those on the uh jockel podcast channel so people can watch them yeah okay um but watching
02:17:38.60 --> 02:17:42.44 those videos now like those videos would not make a mark right now no not just say another one
02:17:42.44 --> 02:17:47.08 because they're good or not good or nothing like time just saying like videos are they're just so
02:17:47.08 --> 02:17:52.04 much everywhere so it starts to become like a wash of just many many millions of videos so
02:17:52.04 --> 02:17:59.72 granted sure like there's you and you know are all our people they they watch our videos regardless
02:17:59.72 --> 02:18:05.32 of of what they are whatever no I mean not regardless but like we do have an advantage
02:18:05.32 --> 02:18:09.72 as far as eyeballs as far as videos or people caring about the videos okay to me the the ocean
02:18:09.72 --> 02:18:14.28 of videos like it's hard to get people to care about videos so you kind of got to be selective I think
02:18:14.28 --> 02:18:19.16 so if I put like a bunch of videos out I don't want people to our people
02:18:19.16 --> 02:18:27.40 to be like oh cool and sort of get bored with them you know so it's like you want to leave a mark
02:18:27.40 --> 02:18:33.72 yeah so I mean it causes me to be a little bit apprehensive with like just flooding you know
02:18:34.84 --> 02:18:38.20 the place the videos the cool thing is there's people making all kinds of videos anyway it's
02:18:38.20 --> 02:18:45.32 with us so yeah so yeah they're out there yeah but yeah yeah I don't know it's weird it's
02:18:45.32 --> 02:18:51.72 but keep in mind too though I'm like the opposite of you in this way where I'm like like
02:18:51.72 --> 02:18:56.20 way more like hesitant like I'm also worried about that you know probably to the point where I shouldn't
02:18:56.20 --> 02:19:01.40 be worried about that quite yet I don't know well yeah we'll make some videos about that cool
02:19:01.40 --> 02:19:09.88 right oh definitely cool awesome anything else man thank you thank you for giving us your history
02:19:09.88 --> 02:19:15.72 human actually seems that good place to wrap up people been asking for a while for some
02:19:15.72 --> 02:19:21.72 more echo Charles they got it they kind of get it on the grounded podcast too the other podcast that we
02:19:21.72 --> 02:19:31.72 have yeah you a little bit it's you yeah it's a little bit more repr- and then again I don't
02:19:31.72 --> 02:19:39.72 know sometimes in the support part it's kind of this podcast yeah it's like representative of kind of back
02:19:40.28 --> 02:19:45.48 like you know okay if we're done training or something right and I don't know be your Greg or somebody
02:19:45.48 --> 02:19:50.20 bring something something up like some subjects and topics and a question for you or each other
02:19:50.20 --> 02:19:54.84 whatever and you start talking about it and then I start talking about it and you're talking trash
02:19:54.84 --> 02:20:00.20 to me like you're you know like all just that whole thing or whatever it's a little more casual
02:20:00.20 --> 02:20:07.08 conversation yeah the grounded kind is more skewed like in that regard well check well speaking of
02:20:07.08 --> 02:20:12.04 conversations I'm having some live conversations with people now you're gonna come to some of the
02:20:12.04 --> 02:20:20.28 show as I'm not sure what which ones but we're even though as people have pointed out I told everyone
02:20:20.28 --> 02:20:25.24 that you know echelon front is not a rock band or we're not going on tour yeah well I am going on
02:20:25.24 --> 02:20:33.16 it's not echelon front it just me and I am going to multiple cities so I guess that does make it a
02:20:33.16 --> 02:20:42.92 tour live gigs January 6 in DC January 11th in Austin which was the first one that sold out
02:20:43.80 --> 02:20:51.80 January 16th in New York January 20th in LA January 27th in Seattle in January 28th in
02:20:51.80 --> 02:21:03.88 SF so at those gigs if you're wondering what I am going to do I am going to talk I'm going to
02:21:03.88 --> 02:21:13.24 dive into some subjects I am going to do some Q&A from the crowd live which is enjoyable for me
02:21:13.24 --> 02:21:25.32 and I'm just going to go deep on some subjects the only I've only done one live event from
02:21:25.32 --> 02:21:31.16 that that would be closest and that was the live podcast that we did in New York City number 160
02:21:31.96 --> 02:21:37.64 and this isn't going to be a podcast and I'm not going to well we might turn these into podcast
02:21:37.64 --> 02:21:41.64 we might take a compilation of some of the questions or take a compilation of some of the things that I
02:21:41.64 --> 02:21:48.12 cover and make them into a podcast but not all of it will be in a podcast and I'm don't the reason
02:21:48.12 --> 02:21:53.56 that I didn't want to do a podcast is I don't want to put any framework around this I want to be able to
02:21:54.28 --> 02:22:05.000 really just go and get after it with no no framework and just be able to get after it hard
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.28 and I know that's I have no real other way of saying it that's what I want to do is I want to
02:22:10.28 --> 02:22:17.64 go hard on these on these events and with no framework and and make it happen so that's what I'm
02:22:17.64 --> 02:22:25.40 doing go to jockellive.com if you want to come to those and echo for so you've been talking
02:22:25.40 --> 02:22:31.72 today about kind of some of the things that you've done to improve your life get yourself we'll say
02:22:31.72 --> 02:22:44.84 on a tighter, a tighter sort of spanth of the path sure and there's good ways to do this in life
02:22:46.52 --> 02:22:51.000 and not to mention you can do that while you're supporting this podcast.
02:22:51.72 --> 02:22:58.28 Yeah if you want to it's true you can support yourself for sure we're highly recommended
02:22:58.28 --> 02:23:05.72 yes you can support the podcast too if you want to up to you because this podcast doesn't
02:23:05.72 --> 02:23:16.76 start off with 12 minutes of advertisements and we're not beholden to our sponsors
02:23:19.16 --> 02:23:25.32 like that because because we're not we don't we don't actually have sponsors and you can
02:23:25.32 --> 02:23:29.48 press stop right now because you know what we're gonna talk about. So what's staying on the path
02:23:29.48 --> 02:23:34.68 representing where we're on the path tips and I don't see tricks because it's not trick
02:23:34.68 --> 02:23:40.84 not trick we'll say guidelines to maybe help you along the way help everyone along the way.
02:23:40.84 --> 02:23:48.44 Yeah help you your husband or wife kids everything the whole gig I like it first thing you do
02:23:48.44 --> 02:23:53.000 jiu jitsu talked about it a little bit today little bit life changing activity by the way you have
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.40 everything about who you'd be without if you did you I would I told you this I've told everyone
02:23:57.40 --> 02:24:01.72 this because I've done been in all this podcast and I've the thread that connected things for me was jiu jitsu
02:24:02.36 --> 02:24:07.64 now what's interesting is you did jiu jitsu you didn't have the other pieces.
02:24:07.64 --> 02:24:12.20 Did you had you didn't have the other pieces but jiu jitsu allowed once you saw the other pieces
02:24:12.20 --> 02:24:17.40 like oh there's the thread there's how these things connect. For me I had the other pieces no jiu
02:24:17.40 --> 02:24:22.68 jitsu no connection got you jiu god connection you were the opposite had jiu jitsu no other pieces oh
02:24:22.68 --> 02:24:29.40 cool got got the other pieces now I said yeah interesting so so we want to do jiu jitsu.
02:24:29.40 --> 02:24:32.84 We do without jiu jitsu jiu jiu jitsu jiu jiu jitsu exists.
02:24:32.84 --> 02:24:41.80 Cesis to exist. Do you know that in a seal platoon there is a packing order.
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.84 That makes sense. That packing order straight up it's based on like hey
02:24:48.84 --> 02:24:53.24 who's gonna win in a fight that's the way it is. It makes sense. It's the way it is.
02:24:53.24 --> 02:24:59.08 And you know what that is not only in a seal platoon there's just like that underlying current.
02:24:59.96 --> 02:25:03.96 So what's nice is if you know jiu jitsu you're gonna move up in that packing order a little bit.
02:25:03.96 --> 02:25:09.96 That is true that's interesting how you put that into words that way uh I
02:25:09.96 --> 02:25:16.36 Man I agree with that that's true and it it applies to a lot of situations that in a way I almost
02:25:16.36 --> 02:25:20.44 done anyone will say I'm but we kind of already know you know that it that
02:25:20.44 --> 02:25:24.52 packing order structure hierarchy whatever that let's just say it exists.
02:25:24.52 --> 02:25:29.24 All right and yes jiu jitsu helps you and that I'm not saying that's the main benefit.
02:25:29.24 --> 02:25:33.08 What's cool about a seal platoon? The reason I can start by saying a seal platoon is because
02:25:33.08 --> 02:25:39.40 in a seal platoon that packing order is not always theoretical. So there's times you get some
02:25:39.40 --> 02:25:45.16 van fights right that's gonna happen. There you can be a van brawl and all of a sudden the
02:25:45.16 --> 02:25:50.60 packing order is revealed. Yeah yeah. And so you feel it but then when you get to see it you go yeah I
02:25:50.60 --> 02:25:54.60 was right there's a little those little packing order here and it has nothing to do with your rank.
02:25:55.80 --> 02:26:00.84 It's like here's what it is. And so when you see it when you see it in the
02:26:02.76 --> 02:26:09.000 in the under current in the under beneath the surface when you kind of think it's there in a seal platoon
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.60 and then it gets revealed and you're like oh yeah it was there then you see it everywhere.
02:26:12.60 --> 02:26:17.16 And you go oh yeah it's over there too oh yeah it's over there too you can just see it and it's a real
02:26:17.16 --> 02:26:24.20 thing. So why not elevate yourself? I'll tell me yourself yeah on that little hierarchy a little bit
02:26:24.20 --> 02:26:28.04 with some jiu jitsu doesn't mean you're running around choking people out. Nope but you can't.
02:26:28.04 --> 02:26:33.32 You can if you yeah well you know yeah so when you do jiu jitsu you need to get an origin
02:26:33.32 --> 02:26:37.24 geese. This is the thing people are gonna hear that right there like when we play that and say you know
02:26:37.24 --> 02:26:41.08 someone's gonna go oh yeah I see what this is this is like a macho bully thing right
02:26:41.08 --> 02:26:45.56 it's like hey I'm sorry to break the news to you this is a reality.
02:26:46.36 --> 02:26:51.000 Yeah this is a reality. Yeah and that's a good point where like yeah I think that
02:26:53.64 --> 02:26:57.32 when you think about it yeah I think that someone could come to could get
02:26:58.04 --> 02:27:01.96 I don't want to say triggered I'm not gonna use a word triggered but someone could just get
02:27:04.28 --> 02:27:10.36 moved into thinking that but it's whether that's the case or not it's like you can say that about
02:27:10.36 --> 02:27:16.04 anything. You know like the thing I'm not sitting here saying I'm not sitting here saying oh well
02:27:16.04 --> 02:27:23.64 this is what it should be like or this is what this is uh this is how things have turned out
02:27:23.64 --> 02:27:28.36 or this is good or this is bad I'm not saying any of those things I'm just telling you what it is
02:27:30.36 --> 02:27:36.68 factually. factually. This is what it is. Well factually that applies to everything in life like okay
02:27:36.68 --> 02:27:41.24 you know you and hey check this out just by the way you can be the best fighter in a seal
02:27:41.24 --> 02:27:45.24 puttune and everyone can hate you like you could never mean you're good operator doesn't mean anything
02:27:45.24 --> 02:27:48.68 well I'm just saying it's there and it's it's one of the many little it's one of the many things that
02:27:48.68 --> 02:27:54.12 many things that are being judged. Yes one of the many things that are being judged it's one of the
02:27:54.12 --> 02:27:59.48 many games that are being played it's one of the many little hierarchies that are existing so
02:28:00.04 --> 02:28:06.28 why not elevate yourself in that game. That's my question the reason the reason to not elevate
02:28:06.28 --> 02:28:11.24 there are no good reasons to not elevate because when you elevate yourself in that game it
02:28:11.24 --> 02:28:17.16 actually will elevate you in other games in your life so change your jitsu people yeah this isn't
02:28:17.16 --> 02:28:22.52 by the way this isn't 1995 when I started a jitsu and you had to you were lucky if there was a
02:28:22.52 --> 02:28:30.84 jitsu school somewhere around you this is America in 2020 and there are jitsu schools everywhere
02:28:30.84 --> 02:28:35.40 or you can go online and you can go to YouTube for free and watch jitsu and get some of your friends
02:28:35.40 --> 02:28:41.48 are rolling on my carpet and you can learn some jitsu learn some jitsu get yourself an orange and
02:28:41.48 --> 02:28:47.72 G. Because you're gonna need one for jitsu yeah it was funny because you know I don't train G
02:28:47.72 --> 02:28:54.60 as much right so it's been a while when we're involved in the promotion of Andy Burke
02:28:54.60 --> 02:29:06.68 well to get his first degree. To agree on his black belt on the black belt yes you know I put
02:29:06.68 --> 02:29:12.92 back on the the rift me that's facing when I came out with my rift on and I said this is
02:29:12.92 --> 02:29:21.000 the knife and you put it on it's a completely different scenario that's just going on so good
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.80 I kind of felt and I'm admitting this to you and whoever's listening because we're real close
02:29:25.80 --> 02:29:30.68 like that and I trust you guys a lot but I'm gonna admit this I felt a little bit like elevated like
02:29:30.68 --> 02:29:37.64 kind of better than everyone you know this is my in a small way because of that get me yes you
02:29:37.64 --> 02:29:47.64 really you know you have to do peat the the folks that made this ge you have to get like
02:29:47.64 --> 02:29:54.68 legitimately say yes you elevated the game this is a game changer this is not normal this isn't
02:29:54.68 --> 02:30:00.52 like this isn't like hey we took a sports car and we put racing stripes on it this isn't like hey
02:30:00.52 --> 02:30:07.24 we took a sports car and we put rims on it this is your driving a sports car I'm flying by you
02:30:07.24 --> 02:30:16.36 and a raptor and an F-20 through raptor yeah so yeah very very good so yeah get it origin main dot
02:30:16.36 --> 02:30:21.40 come that's where you get them so you get a multitude of options by the way including rash
02:30:21.40 --> 02:30:26.52 guards when you do no ghee which I think is important but I'm important right now preferring no
02:30:26.52 --> 02:30:31.32 ghee well then again I don't know it's like I kind of want ghee now I saw you
02:30:32.12 --> 02:30:40.12 wait did you sweep Greg train yes yeah yeah yeah it's hard to sweep yes you got that
02:30:40.12 --> 02:30:45.96 rasslin background yeah but you tied up that handle a little bit overy what did get you yes with
02:30:45.96 --> 02:30:51.48 that ghee you go in phases right you know ghee but yeah so if you do know ghee boom rash guards
02:30:51.48 --> 02:30:58.20 as well all available origin main dot come they also have jeans speaking of elevating the game
02:30:58.92 --> 02:31:06.68 I'm gonna tell you right now get some origin jeans and I will say this the lightweight jeans
02:31:06.68 --> 02:31:14.36 which are called Delta 68 those are possibly the best leg coverings that exist and I have to
02:31:14.36 --> 02:31:18.20 call them leg coverings you can include all kinds of things right we could be killed that cover
02:31:18.20 --> 02:31:23.88 for legs right we could be a wet suit bottom that could cover your legs you know we could be over
02:31:23.88 --> 02:31:28.36 there's all kinds of things that can cover your legs so I'm I'm putting all leg covering
02:31:28.36 --> 02:31:37.40 all leg covering in the world just to say in Delta 68 origin jeans are the best things you
02:31:37.40 --> 02:31:44.84 can cover your legs with the world is ever known straight out all right that's bold I know because
02:31:44.84 --> 02:31:49.48 technically and I'd to go too deep to it but whatever so technically you know when you talk about
02:31:49.48 --> 02:31:54.36 wet suit bottoms and kills all these other things those are like circumstantial like you know
02:31:54.36 --> 02:31:58.20 there's for certain scenarios right like especially when you talk about what suits or spats or
02:31:58.20 --> 02:32:04.04 something like this so you're saying at the end of the day net net as they say I don't I don't really
02:32:04.04 --> 02:32:10.36 like the expression net but whatever net net meaning under the circumstances that you wear a wet
02:32:10.36 --> 02:32:19.48 suit bottom versus jeans under the circumstances you'd ever wear jeans or the light jeans best 100%
02:32:19.48 --> 02:32:28.60 cross the board what I just said is what I meant overall in the world which this is 2020
02:32:29.24 --> 02:32:33.48 and I'm saying of everything that's been invented to put on your legs this is the best thing
02:32:33.48 --> 02:32:40.04 that's been invented Delta 68 now the the heavyweight jeans awesome too and they're caught
02:32:40.04 --> 02:32:47.48 running that close second but my legs don't get cold so I don't need that little extra
02:32:47.48 --> 02:32:54.92 plus I live in Southern California but that's true but Delta 68 that's the one yeah but
02:32:54.92 --> 02:32:59.000 heavyweight the the the right they're not heavyweight they're just normal jeans they're normal jeans
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:05.80 and they're awesome too but they're in second place yeah so I don't you know for Pete they're in
02:33:05.80 --> 02:33:11.96 first place what the heavyweight yeah he's up in Maine yeah he's up in Maine he gets that little bit
02:33:11.96 --> 02:33:17.56 if he's in Southern California you might have a different opinion yeah I'm gonna I'll be it doesn't matter
02:33:17.56 --> 02:33:22.92 to me because my legs don't get cold so it's not a factor so there you well so something
02:33:22.92 --> 02:33:26.92 makes it by the way if you knew that we all this stuff's made America did I mentioned that
02:33:26.92 --> 02:33:32.20 the it's like the little tiny little tagline made in America actually the huge factor
02:33:32.20 --> 02:33:37.88 huge yeah all the building materials are made in America that's how made in America this
02:33:37.88 --> 02:33:42.76 made in America stuff is oh wait we're gonna bring stuff in from other countries no no no no we're
02:33:42.76 --> 02:33:52.44 gonna grow it here American hands yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah joggers you know sweat stuff
02:33:52.44 --> 02:33:58.44 good stuff supplements though yes like I said important supplements joint supplements but you can
02:33:58.44 --> 02:34:04.52 have all the creatine uh mega mass whatever in the world if you join some working but you might
02:34:04.52 --> 02:34:09.40 as you just spinning wheels you're not even spinning your wheels your wheels are locked up like

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.20 kid that's super square away yeah it looks kind of rust you know you know me like well that's
02:39:12.20 --> 02:39:17.16 the reason I said branding in a funny way is because people talk about hey we need to work on our branding
02:39:17.16 --> 02:39:23.16 yeah you know what his branding is doing his job making the stuff that works and functionally
02:39:23.96 --> 02:39:30.44 is able he's able to produce yeah that's where it is and he gets it to boom one shows up boom good job

02:40:20.60 --> 02:40:25.56 yeah yeah because killing it is would take like uh chemicals that I'm not sure
02:40:25.56 --> 02:40:30.20 young aiden could put into a soap yeah we're not done with that we're putting this on our skin

02:49:30.84 --> 02:49:40.52 ups and downs and you will get injured and you will get beat down and you will get tested and those
02:49:40.52 --> 02:49:52.36 hard days will go on and on and on but if you impose discipline in your life if you play the long
02:49:52.36 --> 02:50:01.56 game and think strategic and if you stay on the path and keep moving forward you will end up
02:50:01.56 --> 02:50:13.96 achieving what you want to achieve that will happen so put on that key step on to the
02:50:13.96 --> 02:50:24.28 mats of justice in jujitsu and in life and keep getting after it.
