00:00:22.24 --> 00:00:25.36 Consistently and regularly go through
00:00:26.24 --> 00:00:28.96 Examples of that from military history
00:00:28.96 --> 00:00:30.96 and
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:36.96 About how the principles of extreme ownership apply to combat situations and I've had
00:00:38.56 --> 00:00:40.56 Many combat leaders
00:00:41.20 --> 00:00:44.64 On this podcast from every level from corpros and sergeants

00:00:50.80 --> 00:00:52.48 Talking about
00:00:52.48 --> 00:00:56.88 These principles of leadership and how they apply on the battlefield and
00:00:56.88 --> 00:01:02.16 Sometimes they talk about how these principles positively impact their lives as well as well
00:01:02.56 --> 00:01:04.96 So we've covered the battlefield. We've covered life
00:01:06.24 --> 00:01:10.96 Tonight we're going to get a perspective from the business side from an individual

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.68 Let's start at where you started. Yes, sir. Tell us about growing up
00:02:34.32 --> 00:02:38.88 Well, I grew up in a town not too dissimilar to to this one not as pretty
00:02:39.36 --> 00:02:45.68 Norfolk Virginia come on man. Oh, man. Norfolk's pretty pretty pretty place. I looked out the window at the last night or
00:02:45.68 --> 00:02:49.76 This morning overlooking the little harbor there's like man
00:02:50.56 --> 00:02:56.32 I see the big navy vessels, but doesn't quite look the same as my hometown, but a lot of similarities
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:02.000 A lot of differences, but you so I grew up in Norfolk Norfolk Virginia for those that don't know it's
00:03:03.20 --> 00:03:07.92 You know, it's part of East Coast command for the seals. It's the world's largest navy base. I think
00:03:09.60 --> 00:03:11.60 Lot of shipbuilding there as well
00:03:11.60 --> 00:03:17.36 I'm a navy brat so my my dad was enlisted in the navy's
00:03:18.48 --> 00:03:25.20 He made his way there from Texas, so he was born in Denison, Texas a classic story that you've prized so you a lot
00:03:25.92 --> 00:03:27.92 Tough childhood
00:03:28.64 --> 00:03:32.56 He said I'm gonna go join the navy and see the world and he did he did
00:03:33.60 --> 00:03:35.60 He was enlisted he five
00:03:35.60 --> 00:03:42.80 But he spent four years in the navy two years in the guard, but it brought them to Norfolk as you can imagine
00:03:43.28 --> 00:03:45.28 very met my mom and
00:03:46.56 --> 00:03:49.36 She too was a navy brat, so my grandfather
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:52.08 He he was
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:54.08 Chief Warren officer, so he's
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:56.08 20 years plus so he he served
00:03:56.56 --> 00:04:00.64 He was actually in the Pacific theater for the most of his career. Yeah
00:04:01.76 --> 00:04:03.76 he was injured and
00:04:03.76 --> 00:04:08.32 Comacazia tag and you know he's got some great stories. He's no longer what he was on
00:04:08.80 --> 00:04:13.76 Well, I only know in in the Atlantic he was on his first ship was the Brooklyn. He was us Brooklyn
00:04:14.80 --> 00:04:16.80 He's no longer with us, so in fact I
00:04:17.60 --> 00:04:21.76 Was trying to find some things before I came to see you to see if I could get some more data, but
00:04:22.64 --> 00:04:30.24 He was he lived and kind of raised for many years my mom and guam, so you know he was specific theater and
00:04:30.24 --> 00:04:37.44 You know finally move back to retire Norfolk and and that's how you know my parents met so it's you know
00:04:38.08 --> 00:04:42.16 Navy towns are a lot of examples like that. Yeah, so what's your dad do you are you grown up?
00:04:42.88 --> 00:04:45.84 You know it's funny in the navy, so he's the Texas guy of tough life
00:04:46.48 --> 00:04:48.88 Rainaway frankly to to get some freedom
00:04:49.60 --> 00:04:54.72 In the navy he he was involved with computers of all things which back in the day that was
00:04:55.52 --> 00:04:56.88 Thank you
00:04:56.88 --> 00:04:58.88 Was that like a calculator?
00:04:58.88 --> 00:05:00.88 He would have these big
00:05:00.56 --> 00:05:03.28 Tape type of things that he would choke around and
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:07.60 That was the skill that he learned in the navy and any went to work for
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:13.20 As this kind of new technology rolled out in the banking world, so he would oversee the computers
00:05:13.76 --> 00:05:17.36 at a couple local regional banks now when I was a kid
00:05:17.92 --> 00:05:21.44 I went on a field trip so this is we're talking this might be
00:05:22.08 --> 00:05:27.84 1977 or something like that I was young and I remember we went to a bank on a field trip
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:29.36 And
00:05:29.36 --> 00:05:32.48 First of all, I was just thinking this is the most boring thing I've ever seen in my life
00:05:32.48 --> 00:05:34.16 I don't want to I'm never going in a bank
00:05:34.56 --> 00:05:39.36 But they had this thing that they were calling a computer and they had the little these little punch cards
00:05:39.76 --> 00:05:46.08 And I think it was some kind of an IBM computer system that kept track of something and I remember thinking well
00:05:47.04 --> 00:05:52.64 Not going in a bank in over here. I'm sure there's some kids out. We're thinking wow look at that guy with a briefcase
00:05:53.04 --> 00:05:55.52 Remember did you think of briefcase was ever cool echo Charles?
00:05:55.52 --> 00:06:02.000 No, not that I can yeah, I remember some kids thought a briefcase was cool. I wasn't one of those kids
00:06:02.56 --> 00:06:05.20 So thank going into a big room now with
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.04 Stacks and stacks of machinery and they had to take these tapes down every night and move from for security to a different location
00:06:13.04 --> 00:06:14.000 It wasn't like
00:06:14.56 --> 00:06:19.28 We talk computers today. It's coding and all these you know kind of glamorous things. It was the opposite of that
00:06:19.28 --> 00:06:20.32 So he would
00:06:20.32 --> 00:06:23.68 Manage a store as the tapes would store the data from the transaction
00:06:23.68 --> 00:06:28.56 I guess from the customers during the day and make sure they protected really didn't know what he did
00:06:28.88 --> 00:06:30.88 But I too knew that I
00:06:31.36 --> 00:06:33.36 Never wanted to do that
00:06:33.36 --> 00:06:35.36 But you know as a kid you just
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:38.08 It's I would just say that my parents
00:06:39.28 --> 00:06:41.28 Just great people
00:06:41.28 --> 00:06:43.68 We grew up as you can imagine fairly poor so we
00:06:45.20 --> 00:06:46.24 lived in a
00:06:46.24 --> 00:06:48.72 12-hundred square foot house with one bathroom. I have a brother
00:06:49.36 --> 00:06:51.36 but never knew it frankly never knew
00:06:51.36 --> 00:06:57.44 What wealth really was just knew that my parents loved me just got after my mom was a telephone operator
00:06:58.32 --> 00:06:59.12 When
00:06:59.12 --> 00:07:04.16 Echoed any note that is but uh and they don't have his animal. I'm laughing because that stated about like
00:07:05.12 --> 00:07:07.52 We didn't have much money, but you know we didn't really know it
00:07:08.32 --> 00:07:12.48 So both my parents were school teachers. We didn't have much money and I knew it
00:07:13.92 --> 00:07:18.40 We were we we we had like a call we had one car for a while we had one car
00:07:18.40 --> 00:07:24.32 It was a shavet scooter a beige shavet scooter with no air conditioning and
00:07:25.12 --> 00:07:34.000 The had like a crappy am radio and and we would get get into that thing in the summertime to go like drive to see the grandparents
00:07:34.56 --> 00:07:37.20 Three kids in the back of the tiny as car
00:07:37.76 --> 00:07:40.80 So when people were like oh, you know how it was poor, but we didn't know it
00:07:41.28 --> 00:07:43.28 I knew
00:07:43.28 --> 00:07:46.88 I knew it man. I was like I'm getting out of this joy. Would I get
00:07:46.88 --> 00:07:52.24 I'm having flashbacks so we we had a similar we had a rabbit remember these Volkswagen rabbit
00:07:53.60 --> 00:07:59.84 Toadore not for door and so my dad was some Texas a case. We'd make a long drive from Virginia to Texas no AC
00:08:01.04 --> 00:08:03.60 All we had pictures of the four of us in this thing and
00:08:04.56 --> 00:08:09.60 You know it was good times good. Yeah, and of course. I mean I don't want to make it sound too bad
00:08:10.08 --> 00:08:14.72 When you have a car you're not too bad right and and we've always had food so
00:08:14.72 --> 00:08:19.76 Thanks to my mom and dad and and the the teachers union that they got paid
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:23.76 And we ate we got to eat all the time, but yeah
00:08:24.24 --> 00:08:27.84 As far as not knowing your poor I definitely I let me refresh it
00:08:27.84 --> 00:08:32.64 I knew we didn't have much money that that much I do I knew we weren't I knew we weren't getting
00:08:33.20 --> 00:08:37.92 Like you know a new bicycle right might get a used bicycle we might get a you know
00:08:39.28 --> 00:08:41.52 Well we always had some fun around Christmas time
00:08:41.52 --> 00:08:47.92 The the saying in my family was it's gonna be a lean Christmas yeah, which had been inherited I guess from my my mom's dad
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.60 Who would say the same thing it's gonna be a lean Christmas and that's all we'd hear about
00:08:51.84 --> 00:08:56.16 So whatever dreams you had for Santa go count on yeah
00:08:56.80 --> 00:09:03.52 Well look I go what appreciate this being Hawaii look the big meal sometimes during the week was spam
00:09:04.64 --> 00:09:09.76 Now back east that was an I think my mom grew up in Guam for many years, right? So yeah, we'll fire up some spam
00:09:09.76 --> 00:09:17.52 I put in a crock pot and then like what so running joke when I realized that spam really wasn't real me to see my mom
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.92 She made she signed me up for the spam with a month club and I had a sweet shirt that's its spam on it
00:09:23.92 --> 00:09:25.92 I would get this letter every month
00:09:26.40 --> 00:09:28.40 So you know again
00:09:28.96 --> 00:09:33.60 It took me water real I say you guys don't need spam at your house, you know, so anyway
00:09:34.24 --> 00:09:36.24 But so grew up in Norfolk
00:09:36.24 --> 00:09:37.60 You know
00:09:37.60 --> 00:09:39.60 Good parents normal childhood
00:09:39.60 --> 00:09:43.12 I actually going to elementary school
00:09:43.12 --> 00:09:46.16 I went this was when cross town busing was a thing
00:09:46.16 --> 00:09:50.96 I don't know if they have that here in California but back in the day that we would have crossed down busing in Norfolk
00:09:50.96 --> 00:09:52.80 So I grew up in a place called Ocean View
00:09:53.68 --> 00:09:59.28 I don't know if you remember that I don't know if you were stationed back in the I was stationed I remember where Ocean View is it's a little sketch
00:09:59.28 --> 00:10:03.36 We'll talk about that later maybe, but so across town busing was a big deal
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:06.64 So in first grade, you know mom would walk me out to the bus stop
00:10:06.64 --> 00:10:10.40 45 50 minute drive on the bus to a school
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:17.12 Young park elementary, you know, it's literally in the middle of the project and it did you know they were crossed down bus and so
00:10:17.92 --> 00:10:24.000 That lasted for a couple years and mom had enough of it so she said hey, we're gonna find the money to send
00:10:24.80 --> 00:10:26.80 Of course ever brother a parish and
00:10:27.44 --> 00:10:31.20 We're gonna send the boys to a Catholic school because Catholic schools are
00:10:31.20 --> 00:10:37.68 cheaper than private schools put great educations good educations and so we ended up going to a little private school
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:41.44 And she was so pleased I think I think if it was like $2,000
00:10:42.24 --> 00:10:44.72 But for those it was real money right and so
00:10:45.68 --> 00:10:48.64 Now that kind of changed the course of my life and and
00:10:48.88 --> 00:10:55.60 Fast forward a few years so we'll go up and go up there and then went to high school when you say that it changed the course of your life
00:10:55.60 --> 00:11:02.32 You can't just throw that out there and then to say hey we're moving on well what just the the folks on education
00:11:02.64 --> 00:11:04.64 Yes, so the focus on
00:11:04.64 --> 00:11:08.08 Look discipline I think is in port part of aspect of a Catholic
00:11:08.72 --> 00:11:10.08 Education now
00:11:10.08 --> 00:11:14.56 You know, I literally had nons that were teaching us right so you have some discipline that's instilled in that
00:11:15.12 --> 00:11:17.60 Some you know, okay, we're not Catholic either right and so
00:11:17.76 --> 00:11:21.68 Did you have to tell say that you're Catholic to get it? No, no, okay
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:24.24 They may allow non-Calcics to get it okay and so
00:11:24.24 --> 00:11:28.80 But I know I I certainly believe in the morality that they teach
00:11:29.36 --> 00:11:35.60 Now I would literally have to go today we went to mass every week and I couldn't participate right so literally for me
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:36.96 It was like
00:11:36.96 --> 00:11:40.48 We're certainly I just go and sit and as an hours remember it's nice and cool in the church
00:11:40.56 --> 00:11:44.96 Were they still doing the in Latin? No, no, not at this point. No, not at this point
00:11:44.96 --> 00:11:49.92 How long ago is Latin services? I'm I can't find my crazy no because they used to talk about
00:11:49.92 --> 00:11:55.28 Like I thought they did Latin up until fairly recently, you know the 70s or 60s
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:58.96 Long before maybe I was I'm not that old job
00:11:58.96 --> 00:12:03.36 Maybe I know they definitely didn't land but but not for me not for me
00:12:03.36 --> 00:12:06.32 But I just remember you know what could participate couldn't take the sacrament and
00:12:07.04 --> 00:12:11.04 But it was cool I would go as nice and cool in there and just sit do whatever
00:12:11.28 --> 00:12:14.64 There were a few in on Catholic so we just kind of pal around together were that group
00:12:14.64 --> 00:12:20.64 And just which is chill as people would go through the mass every week and as cool whatever
00:12:21.12 --> 00:12:29.60 But how it changed my life is you know a good curriculum a good focus on discipline and education and and can't really a good
00:12:29.92 --> 00:12:31.92 Moreal compass was delivered
00:12:31.92 --> 00:12:36.08 Weekly right not I'm not talking about mass here. I'm just talking about you know how they went about
00:12:36.64 --> 00:12:41.12 Derreducation right look if you look at today is a is a boom in Catholic education
00:12:41.12 --> 00:12:44.16 Yeah, again, what's going on education around the country and so
00:12:45.12 --> 00:12:49.68 You know it was a important part of my kind of upbringing even though I wasn't Catholic
00:12:49.68 --> 00:12:55.12 It was it was important part of my upbringing and how long were you in that Catholic school for why went so second grade?
00:12:55.12 --> 00:12:59.68 So third grade on through high school. Oh all the way through high school. Yeah, so
00:13:00.72 --> 00:13:04.48 Different schools but still in the Catholic sister so all these little teeny Catholic
00:13:04.48 --> 00:13:10.72 Elements your schools would feed up to the one high school they had in town at this time is called Norfolk Catholic High
00:13:11.60 --> 00:13:13.60 And some of my brother and I went there and
00:13:14.88 --> 00:13:19.68 So my my dad passed away when I was 14 so I was a freshman just tough
00:13:20.80 --> 00:13:22.80 How how that happened?
00:13:22.80 --> 00:13:27.60 Well he so he he again grew up in Texas with a lot of medical care and
00:13:28.40 --> 00:13:32.000 What they think was so see he had romantic fever when he was a child and and
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.76 You know
00:13:33.76 --> 00:13:40.40 Likely he never got medical attention until it was probably too late so he literally wore glasses because the the fever burned his
00:13:40.80 --> 00:13:45.12 His redness right so I mean members so he was born in the late 50s
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.04 And you know in Texas not in a big city. He was he was born in Dennis in Texas and later lived on a cattle farm right
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:57.68 So different mindset about healthcare and and and and and treating things
00:13:57.68 --> 00:14:02.16 Aggressive like so oh he's got 103 temperature. He'll be alright just you know
00:14:02.72 --> 00:14:06.56 Just laid out here's some water you know will be fine, but he he ultimately wasn't fine
00:14:06.56 --> 00:14:13.20 So he had he had a kidney failure a couple years prior so he was on dialysis for that and
00:14:14.24 --> 00:14:18.88 You know he would he would literally go on walks every morning to kind of keep in shape and he was then
00:14:19.28 --> 00:14:23.36 He'll not built like me. He was then and we go on these walks and
00:14:23.36 --> 00:14:28.80 One day just didn't come back. Please come to the house and we're about to go to school
00:14:29.76 --> 00:14:31.76 My brother and I and
00:14:31.92 --> 00:14:34.96 My brother he's a couple years old and he would drive us at school in the cops
00:14:35.44 --> 00:14:40.88 Literally came and we lived in a court came to the court drove through the court and I remember we're just kind of sitting there
00:14:41.92 --> 00:14:46.48 I was getting a drink of water from the faucet and I made some smart ass common like oh
00:14:46.48 --> 00:14:49.28 They're coming to get this guy Roger Baker every year, you know
00:14:49.28 --> 00:14:54.96 Again, you know rough neighborhood can't leave so a lot of guys the police would come by all the time
00:14:55.28 --> 00:14:59.60 And so he pulled right in front of the house and I I said something else smart to my brother like oh
00:14:59.60 --> 00:15:04.16 What'd you do and so he comes to the door and he brings my dad's wallet and
00:15:05.04 --> 00:15:09.44 Is it one of you guys needs to come with me and so my brother was the oldest and so he went
00:15:10.56 --> 00:15:16.16 He went with the police officer and you know I was there alone in that house and
00:15:16.16 --> 00:15:24.000 And that's just a very strange I mean when you're child's 14 just turn 14 just entering in high school as a freshman and
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000 Yeah, now I called my mom and
00:15:28.40 --> 00:15:32.48 She came home and you went to hospital and he was gone so
00:15:33.60 --> 00:15:36.000 I didn't early age you know when that that
00:15:36.40 --> 00:15:38.40 That happens you you
00:15:38.40 --> 00:15:42.08 You have one or two things right you have to you can either hide within yourself or you can
00:15:42.08 --> 00:15:45.76 Stop them to try to be more of a man around the house and and my mom
00:15:47.36 --> 00:15:52.24 You know she she's old school and the sense that you know she was very dependent on my dad
00:15:54.08 --> 00:15:59.12 She turned into we called her to Wanda after that like she's tried to be strong and do things that
00:16:00.08 --> 00:16:03.52 You know that she needed to do take care of her boys and she did
00:16:04.56 --> 00:16:11.12 But I had to become in my mind I had become more the man the house and and manage the finances and other things like that
00:16:11.12 --> 00:16:13.12 Because she wasn't great with that and so
00:16:13.92 --> 00:16:19.36 The interesting thing is she couldn't afford to send us to this school now in North of Catholic and
00:16:20.64 --> 00:16:22.64 And I didn't know this for a few years
00:16:22.96 --> 00:16:26.08 But the school came to her and said hey listen if you can pay for
00:16:26.80 --> 00:16:30.40 one of your sons a child my brother
00:16:31.28 --> 00:16:33.28 Then Mac can go for free
00:16:33.92 --> 00:16:35.92 Big deal right so
00:16:35.92 --> 00:16:41.12 That's how I was able to go to high school is that that school stepped up and allowed
00:16:41.84 --> 00:16:46.40 You know two knuckleheads to go to the school and when when I couldn't really afford it my mom couldn't afford it
00:16:47.20 --> 00:16:52.40 And I found out you know many years later, but my wife Sarah and I have you know
00:16:52.40 --> 00:16:58.000 We've given a lot of money back to the school and we even doubt a few scholarships for athletes to go to school
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.04 It's just
00:16:59.28 --> 00:17:02.24 More than you know the colleges I went to that was
00:17:02.24 --> 00:17:09.44 You know kind of the greatest act of kindness that set me on a course to to be an entrepreneur in the business man today and
00:17:10.16 --> 00:17:12.16 So I just I love that place
00:17:12.16 --> 00:17:14.64 And Sarah and I continue to get back to it, but
00:17:15.44 --> 00:17:17.44 So the high school
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:18.64 You know
00:17:18.64 --> 00:17:20.64 That's I from that pretty pretty
00:17:21.04 --> 00:17:24.000 Typical existence I played sports not great like you guys
00:17:25.04 --> 00:17:27.04 I played football and basketball
00:17:27.04 --> 00:17:33.04 Um, large and a lot of football all you know all conference I think it made all state one time, but
00:17:33.52 --> 00:17:36.80 Not great I remember like junior year
00:17:38.08 --> 00:17:42.24 This about you can ready go to college and look to be fair. I was complete knucklehead
00:17:43.12 --> 00:17:49.04 Might had a 2.2 GPA so your grades were not great. No, it's a great job great. We just not study no
00:17:49.04 --> 00:17:52.40 Just didn't care. I don't really think I brought a book home and and
00:17:54.24 --> 00:17:55.84 You know
00:17:55.84 --> 00:17:57.84 And I have the I factually did not know
00:17:57.84 --> 00:18:00.64 I'm not not not I did not break a vocal
00:18:01.68 --> 00:18:07.44 Well, I mean you have you have kids and some sons so I like literally I I have two sons now and
00:18:08.16 --> 00:18:11.36 I would be appalled if that that were the case for my sons so
00:18:12.96 --> 00:18:17.68 And looking back like what I know go so my mom worked all the time she you know I was a last key kid I literally
00:18:18.96 --> 00:18:22.72 That's all her you know right before bed and that was it and she had to work and so
00:18:22.72 --> 00:18:30.32 I remember going to a guidance counselor back in the day and the guidance counselor literally said hey
00:18:31.60 --> 00:18:33.60 You might want to think about a career in the shipyards
00:18:34.80 --> 00:18:38.64 And I got what do you mean you know mom says I need to go to college
00:18:39.36 --> 00:18:41.36 She's like yeah, but
00:18:41.60 --> 00:18:43.60 Mom has been seeing your grades
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000 You're not getting into college lady said and you know Norfolk is a home a bunch of shipyards, right and so
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.92 And nothing wrong with working the shipyards and I'll cover that in a little bit but she she she she's like you need to go
00:18:55.92 --> 00:18:58.96 We're think about that as a profession, right so I'll go home
00:18:59.68 --> 00:19:01.92 That was not a good conversation with mom
00:19:02.72 --> 00:19:08.40 She never went to college of course, but she'd already she knew about this thing called college and she said my my boys are going to college
00:19:08.40 --> 00:19:11.36 I don't know what that looks like but my boys are going to college and so
00:19:12.48 --> 00:19:14.48 Thankfully I could play football now
00:19:15.60 --> 00:19:16.64 I
00:19:16.64 --> 00:19:19.04 Should I should say that you know lightly?
00:19:19.04 --> 00:19:24.48 I could play football was smart enough to kind of talk my way and play my way into college
00:19:24.88 --> 00:19:26.88 but D3 so D3
00:19:28.56 --> 00:19:29.60 You know
00:19:29.60 --> 00:19:34.96 I go played and that you know D1 choose legit, but D3 I joke around it's like 13th grade
00:19:37.20 --> 00:19:41.60 So and they also don't give any money to go to play D3, but they they allow
00:19:42.56 --> 00:19:48.56 At least for me they allowed a knucklehead index into school so I was able to parlay kind of my average football skill
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:53.36 Into an amount of decent high scab but I could I could leverage that into getting into college and so I did so
00:19:55.20 --> 00:19:58.08 This is this is the interesting too. So I
00:19:58.48 --> 00:20:03.68 Went which college go to so I initially went to you gonna laugh Catholic University
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:06.08 So mind you
00:20:06.08 --> 00:20:11.68 Here's a guy. I'm a piscopee and like and so I imagine a all my careers been education
00:20:11.68 --> 00:20:13.68 By hokey
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.20 Oh
00:20:15.20 --> 00:20:16.72 You know
00:20:16.72 --> 00:20:21.60 So I ended up at Catholic University which is a division three school but CNDC and
00:20:23.04 --> 00:20:29.20 Supply football there but quickly boom blew out my knee. Oh yeah, right and I remember
00:20:30.24 --> 00:20:33.68 I'm not going to that shipyard. I can't go back right so
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:38.96 So my mine had to turn on turn to brain on I remember right
00:20:38.96 --> 00:20:42.88 What year was this in college at your career knee so I graduated high school in 90s was 91
00:20:43.92 --> 00:20:45.20 91 and
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:48.24 Did you play a season or did you know never saw the field?
00:20:49.28 --> 00:20:52.48 How do you blow any practicing yeah, okay yeah and
00:20:53.04 --> 00:20:58.72 Look I had a couple looks from service academies and course that was never gonna happen given my grades but
00:21:00.80 --> 00:21:02.80 But it was the is the only way I could really get
00:21:03.52 --> 00:21:06.88 Opportunity go to college and and so I went to Catholic
00:21:07.76 --> 00:21:11.36 blew out my knee but because of my fear I decided okay
00:21:11.36 --> 00:21:14.40 There's this thing called a brain you might want to turn that on. I
00:21:16.16 --> 00:21:18.16 You're looking back
00:21:18.16 --> 00:21:20.80 You're looking back and you say oh, this is what I said
00:21:20.80 --> 00:21:25.20 Do you actually remember a moment in time when you said okay?
00:21:25.20 --> 00:21:28.24 I'm gonna need to I'm gonna need to apply myself
00:21:28.80 --> 00:21:33.04 Academically one hour. Okay, so you that that actually because I look at my people was like hey
00:21:33.04 --> 00:21:39.04 When did this happen when was this moment and I I've always for the most part had more gradual
00:21:39.04 --> 00:21:41.04 Sort of sort of
00:21:42.16 --> 00:21:45.12 Realizations of what's happening in the world including for myself
00:21:45.44 --> 00:21:48.96 But that's where I'm asking they like did you have a specific like all right
00:21:50.16 --> 00:21:52.96 Literally I got to find their event right so you blow your knee
00:21:53.28 --> 00:21:59.40 Can't walk I was literally in the hospital like southeast DC not the greatest kind of hospital that you want to be in and
00:22:00.16 --> 00:22:02.80 Literally in that bed I said I'm not going back
00:22:03.52 --> 00:22:07.28 Not I'm not meaning Catholic, but I'm not going back to Norfolk
00:22:07.28 --> 00:22:09.28 I'm not gonna go back
00:22:09.28 --> 00:22:11.28 What I got to do right so
00:22:11.84 --> 00:22:16.32 Turned on the brain I finished the semester there had a three two which is okay
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:23.84 I didn't frankly fit. I didn't like the place. I didn't like I didn't like living in DC and so
00:22:26.40 --> 00:22:32.08 Again my mom she she does it we couldn't really for college right so she did a lot of research and she found that there's a
00:22:32.08 --> 00:22:38.24 A foundation in Norfolk called the Norfolk Foundation and they literally for underprivileged kids
00:22:38.24 --> 00:22:45.20 They would send these kids to this this this college ultimate graduate from called Hampton Sydney Colleges and Virginia
00:22:45.20 --> 00:22:46.16 It's a
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:48.80 Classical liberal arts school so when I say classic
00:22:49.36 --> 00:22:51.68 You know, they talk Greek and Latin
00:22:51.68 --> 00:22:56.80 We had two years of something called rhetoric and you had to place out of it before you could graduate right
00:22:56.80 --> 00:23:00.48 It is so old school. It's like a true academy and I loved it, right?
00:23:00.48 --> 00:23:02.48 So it was small less than a thousand
00:23:03.20 --> 00:23:04.56 Students
00:23:04.56 --> 00:23:08.24 Professor to student ratio was very high and professors that taught there
00:23:08.24 --> 00:23:14.32 They wanted to teach they didn't want to ride the research. They wanted to teach and is a perfect environment for me and so
00:23:15.12 --> 00:23:17.12 I went there
00:23:17.12 --> 00:23:19.52 The Norfolk Foundation paid my tuition
00:23:20.72 --> 00:23:22.72 What did you study?
00:23:22.72 --> 00:23:27.52 Economics and religion believe it or not so I have two degrees from there one in economics and one of religion
00:23:28.08 --> 00:23:30.08 People always ask me what
00:23:30.08 --> 00:23:35.20 Religion thing is the late day once you know me you realize that religion thing the one what what do you have that for?
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:36.88 What's just
00:23:36.88 --> 00:23:40.08 Look at economics was pure I want I wanted to to learn more about
00:23:40.56 --> 00:23:43.92 You know the economy and how to be effective in business and things like that, but
00:23:44.88 --> 00:23:47.52 My curiosity was really what drove
00:23:47.52 --> 00:23:52.56 Religion right so imagine going to school at a Catholic school for almost my childhood and
00:23:53.04 --> 00:23:56.80 Then of course, I'm a piscuit paying about just fascinated with the idea of
00:23:56.80 --> 00:23:58.80 of
00:23:58.80 --> 00:24:00.80 How religions are
00:24:00.80 --> 00:24:04.80 Historically rolled out and maintained and they are fed their effect on
00:24:05.12 --> 00:24:12.56 You know mankind and so we would study all kinds of religions and so it's just a is a personal kind of journey of my own intellect not
00:24:13.76 --> 00:24:16.80 Frankly not doing anything with us as you can imagine
00:24:16.80 --> 00:24:19.84 Yeah, well, no, if I was in the FBI and saw that thing pop up
00:24:19.84 --> 00:24:23.92 I would have pegged you as a cult potential future colater economy and religion
00:24:23.92 --> 00:24:31.84 All right, we're gonna watch this guy he's gonna be making moves. Well look that I saw I wrote my senior thesis on something called the morality of capitalism
00:24:32.48 --> 00:24:34.48 So I tried to blend them together
00:24:34.96 --> 00:24:39.36 Did so did you know you wanted to go into business at this time? Well you started to think
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.96 Did you see some kind of a career path was there anything an interest to do?
00:24:43.84 --> 00:24:48.000 You know I knew I didn't want to go into a traditional profession when I say profession
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.64 I mean true profession so you know law or medicine or accounting like I
00:24:52.64 --> 00:24:58.56 My mind wasn't linear that way and and I always knew that I wanted to pursue something in business
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:04.56 Whatever that might mean like it's so it's so ambiguous when you say hey, yeah, I want to go into business
00:25:05.76 --> 00:25:08.96 What the heck does that even mean right what does that look like and and
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:13.92 I just knew I wanted to have the tools to do that job
00:25:13.92 --> 00:25:16.72 I could go into business and be successful it was later
00:25:16.72 --> 00:25:23.76 That I learned kind of what specifically I wanted to be involved with in business as I met some some mentors, but
00:25:24.96 --> 00:25:32.56 At Hampton Sydney now I just knew I wanted to get some degree and and and that I felt like could best prepare me to be a successful
00:25:32.56 --> 00:25:38.000 Business and so I did my as I said I got this North of Foundation scholarship, right?
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.36 So and I get there my dad's gone no one my family's ever to go on to college
00:25:43.36 --> 00:25:45.36 I'm
00:25:45.36 --> 00:25:50.08 Mom thought this was and I thought okay, look at this is cool. I got this all paid for right well
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:52.56 I get there and what I realized they paid tuition
00:25:52.56 --> 00:25:55.84 But there's a little difference between room and bored and things like that so
00:25:57.12 --> 00:25:59.12 I'm a husser so I've always worked
00:25:59.84 --> 00:26:02.64 Even as in high school like it it's just part of the alone
00:26:03.12 --> 00:26:07.12 mindset we've always worked I remember I was working at Marine at 14
00:26:07.12 --> 00:26:12.72 Sanding the pile in the boat so they could paint them now mind you I didn't even have any kind of
00:26:13.60 --> 00:26:16.08 Face mask on like today with my company like
00:26:16.72 --> 00:26:18.72 What would they let me do that for?
00:26:19.92 --> 00:26:21.92 14 right
00:26:21.92 --> 00:26:26.72 I better not say the marina, but I was paid in cash and my brother worked there and he got the good gig
00:26:26.72 --> 00:26:32.24 So he drove one of these huge forklifts the where they stored the boats and you know they're huge forklifed
00:26:32.24 --> 00:26:37.12 And I was the idiot that would climb up on the fork lift get in the boat as you put it in the water
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:40.88 So I could drive it in park it so when the guests came they could pick up their boats anyway
00:26:41.28 --> 00:26:43.28 so we'd always been working and
00:26:45.20 --> 00:26:50.48 Even in high school I think you appreciate this and you might know these guys so I was a lifeguard of all things in high school
00:26:50.56 --> 00:26:52.96 Believe or not so I worked at this ocean view
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Life beach patrol and
00:26:56.88 --> 00:27:01.28 Good gig paid a lot more than marina didn't have to work as hard you can kind of work out and have some fun
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:03.28 You're not be reading the lead paint
00:27:04.40 --> 00:27:06.40 Right down your throw does I look at it
00:27:07.92 --> 00:27:11.12 Now you know people always joke. Okay. We knew there for the ladies and stuff
00:27:11.12 --> 00:27:14.40 I don't think you've really been ocean view bro. There's really no ladies there
00:27:16.08 --> 00:27:17.68 It's pretty rough place like a
00:27:17.68 --> 00:27:23.60 We used to work at this place called there are a couple beaches there and Norfolk and we worked at this place called city beach
00:27:24.40 --> 00:27:29.52 And city is a big development house replace it, but city was kind of way down at the end of the end of the bay
00:27:29.52 --> 00:27:34.16 And there were and that's where you could get the hotels you could get for the hour right and
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:40.32 Hookers on the corners and stuff like that and they only let the big guys go down there to city and we called it of course
00:27:40.32 --> 00:27:41.92 Shitty we're gonna go ahead shitty
00:27:42.08 --> 00:27:47.04 What I love those we had rescue boards. So we basically served all day because the client held in roll and mine
00:27:47.04 --> 00:27:52.16 You're surfing and Norfolk is very dimmer than here, but we felt cool jack-o-common
00:27:52.80 --> 00:27:57.24 So you know it's okay, well, you know you get there you get on duty at 10 and
00:27:57.24 --> 00:28:01.88 And clients don't really show up at that beach until about three so we kind of screwed around
00:28:02.92 --> 00:28:05.96 Well, there's a couple characters that you meet during
00:28:06.44 --> 00:28:10.04 Being a lifeguard right so you have the quintessential guy that that's his profession
00:28:10.12 --> 00:28:13.40 You know the dude that's like you would call him dude. His name is Jed
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:17.08 It like he was 40 years old you like a kid. I don't want to be that guy
00:28:17.40 --> 00:28:19.64 But we had these a few guys that went to
00:28:19.64 --> 00:28:26.44 Well, they went to college at Old Dominion and that work just work in there for the summer making good money and and
00:28:27.56 --> 00:28:29.56 And there forget this one guy
00:28:30.12 --> 00:28:37.16 He was a workout maniac so he was a wrestler at Old Dominion and we our lifeguard stands are about 10 feet tall and
00:28:38.28 --> 00:28:40.28 He used to hang off these things and do pull ups
00:28:41.40 --> 00:28:45.64 And then he would do one handed pull ups, you know, he'd grab his hand to complete the gentleman
00:28:45.64 --> 00:28:50.76 And I was in high school. I this this was cool to me, right so on his hey
00:28:50.76 --> 00:28:52.76 I'm not I'm I'm way out of high school
00:28:54.76 --> 00:28:58.92 I'm a fat ass can't do that. That's pretty cool. So on the lunch break so this guy
00:28:59.64 --> 00:29:04.92 He wouldn't go on lunch. He would literally jump on the beach take off his lifeguard gear and
00:29:05.16 --> 00:29:08.60 Dig holes he take out a military shovel and dig holes
00:29:08.60 --> 00:29:14.60 Is deep as he could as fast as he could for an hour and then filament does not lunch break was an hour and
00:29:16.52 --> 00:29:20.60 And I remember asking I said what do you what do you mean I love it? What are you doing?
00:29:21.08 --> 00:29:22.60 He said I want to be a seal
00:29:23.16 --> 00:29:26.36 So what's a seal right and so
00:29:27.24 --> 00:29:30.60 At city beach it's right across a jetty from
00:29:31.72 --> 00:29:37.16 At the amphitheid base there right and so you'd see copters out there drop in people and I didn't think there were seals but you
00:29:37.16 --> 00:29:43.000 They drop you know divers in or whatever and because I was so busy down there at that beach
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.24 I could just sit there with my bunocks and watch you see him swimming back right they just swim back
00:29:47.24 --> 00:29:49.48 And he's guys are out there a long time and
00:29:49.88 --> 00:29:53.96 He would say well those are probably seals and then he came in one day and came me a book
00:29:54.76 --> 00:29:56.12 Rogue warrior
00:29:56.12 --> 00:30:02.76 We classic right so of course is a lot of reading times sometimes on these liveguard stands because no one was there
00:30:03.24 --> 00:30:05.24 So Marcinka read that book and and
00:30:05.24 --> 00:30:08.52 And it was fun the other day. I was working out with
00:30:09.56 --> 00:30:11.56 retired seal
00:30:11.72 --> 00:30:13.72 And I had this
00:30:13.72 --> 00:30:19.96 I stole it I shouldn't say that but I have a a lifeguard sign in my gym at home like a rod
00:30:20.52 --> 00:30:22.52 He said I found that
00:30:23.16 --> 00:30:25.16 City of Norfolk I found that but
00:30:25.40 --> 00:30:31.40 So we're working on he said hey what's that sign and I said well I worked at I worked at this and this lifeguard thing and
00:30:31.40 --> 00:30:35.72 Then I remembered this story of this guy that wanted to be a seal and I said hey did
00:30:36.12 --> 00:30:38.12 Did you ever know this guy?
00:30:38.12 --> 00:30:40.36 His and his face he looked at me and said
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:43.24 You kidding right so
00:30:43.48 --> 00:30:46.04 So his name and I I have I've been seen him since
00:30:46.04 --> 00:30:47.56 Jocco so you should know this so his
00:30:48.28 --> 00:30:51.72 That two guys that work there they're called the fuzzle brothers as well. Oh no
00:30:52.68 --> 00:30:54.68 John and Chris fuzzle worked
00:30:55.40 --> 00:30:57.88 As lifeguards with me back in the day
00:30:57.88 --> 00:31:01.96 I had those of you John fuzzle was the guy that would just
00:31:02.92 --> 00:31:07.32 Work out maniac like hanging off lifeguard sand's digging holes and
00:31:08.36 --> 00:31:12.20 You know when I when I mentioned it the flan did you know this guy so you kidding right?
00:31:12.20 --> 00:31:18.20 So I did he just in her webs and check him out so I I guess they made it and they had a pretty good career in the seal team
00:31:19.48 --> 00:31:25.40 But I literally remember this guy hanging off the lifeguard sand doing you know one on pro loves what so I made it good for them
00:31:25.40 --> 00:31:27.40 So I'm so small story there, but
00:31:28.20 --> 00:31:30.20 You know always working
00:31:30.60 --> 00:31:36.60 So when I get to college of course realizing I had to figure out how to eat and where to live and things like that so I got a couple jobs
00:31:37.64 --> 00:31:44.28 One one of those jobs was I was a bartender now so I went to this school is the middle of the mountains of Virginia
00:31:44.28 --> 00:31:48.36 So not much light night life, but I worked for the school so I would
00:31:49.48 --> 00:31:51.48 Work for these trusty events
00:31:51.48 --> 00:31:59.24 So trusty is in college or folks that you know kind of sit on a board and give a lot of money and kind of direct the college and where it's going
00:31:59.24 --> 00:32:03.48 So they're pretty typically pretty successful folks that kind of for to give a lot of money away and
00:32:04.60 --> 00:32:09.32 You know I'd exposed to any of that world before and so I was working these trusty events and you know
00:32:09.32 --> 00:32:11.32 I had to wear bow tie and it's pretty horrible
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.16 So I stand there and have that this bar and this this gentleman fresh man year came up and
00:32:19.16 --> 00:32:23.24 He wanted to scotch neat really good at making those
00:32:24.68 --> 00:32:31.72 So and so we just got talking for four years we talked and again not about business but about life and politics and sports and
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.92 You know he he really became somewhere that I looked forward to talking to and
00:32:37.96 --> 00:32:42.60 his name was Bob Hatcher and and Bob had started a company
00:32:44.36 --> 00:32:46.36 that
00:32:46.36 --> 00:32:51.96 Called Johnson and Higgins which was one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the world he later sold it to Martian
00:32:52.68 --> 00:32:58.36 They are the largest and you know, I don't know what he was worth but it was a lot and I remember seeing you here
00:32:58.36 --> 00:33:03.40 He says hey Malone if you ever if you ever need anything give me a call and
00:33:04.20 --> 00:33:05.16 You know
00:33:05.16 --> 00:33:10.68 Okay, what does that mean right so again, you know and I even I said yes, I'm Mr. Hadjord. Thank you's you know
00:33:10.68 --> 00:33:17.24 So anyway, so uh graduate Hampton Sydney the brain turned on believe it or not five bit of cap
00:33:17.24 --> 00:33:20.28 which all these you know pretty high GPA
00:33:22.12 --> 00:33:24.12 Which is
00:33:24.12 --> 00:33:27.96 What it taught me was like you you focus on anything you bring some discipline to your studies
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.56 Most people can achieve anything right especially in school. It's it's not that hard. You just got to be disciplined about it
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:35.56 And I took it as my job like I was there
00:33:35.56 --> 00:33:41.08 To find a path to get out get the highest GPA I could to get theoretically give me the best job that I could
00:33:42.28 --> 00:33:44.28 So as I'm finishing up school
00:33:44.28 --> 00:33:49.08 One of the deans of the schools comes to me and says hey Malone I want you to apply for the scholarship
00:33:50.60 --> 00:33:55.24 And of course I heard scholarships are for you and I said okay, what's this about and he
00:33:55.24 --> 00:33:59.000 He encouraged me to apply for something called the rotary foundation scholarship
00:33:59.64 --> 00:34:02.84 Actually the rotary the rotary ambassador or a fellowship
00:34:03.64 --> 00:34:05.40 Very fancy
00:34:05.40 --> 00:34:10.36 And through the rotary club well apparently I've rotary clubs throughout the world and
00:34:11.32 --> 00:34:18.52 Part of this this this ambassador or role is that you go to these countries want where a country you're designated
00:34:19.24 --> 00:34:21.40 And you speak to rotary clubs in that country
00:34:22.12 --> 00:34:29.24 Every weekend so you travel around this countries given speeches about literally life in America and where you're from it's truly ambassador
00:34:30.04 --> 00:34:33.08 And in return for that they pay for your graduate school
00:34:33.08 --> 00:34:36.52 Like nice good gig I give that a go and so
00:34:37.64 --> 00:34:42.04 Now I can only speak English and so you know there's only that limits to where you can go in the world
00:34:42.04 --> 00:34:45.08 And so Australia or you know I'd kingdom right so
00:34:46.52 --> 00:34:47.24 I
00:34:47.24 --> 00:34:48.52 Being an economist
00:34:48.52 --> 00:34:53.24 Lose that phrase loosely I knew of course of me or Adam Smith
00:34:53.88 --> 00:34:57.48 He he actually taught at the University of Glasgow in Scotland
00:34:57.96 --> 00:35:00.68 There's a school there called Adam Smith School of Finance and
00:35:00.68 --> 00:35:06.92 And I applied to find the way it worked as you have to apply and then they at the rotary club picks and so
00:35:07.40 --> 00:35:12.84 Of course I pick the big boys I applied to Cambridge and lunch school of economics use the big boys right
00:35:13.80 --> 00:35:18.84 And on the fifth choice I brought my applied to University of Glasgow now what's interesting about Glasgow?
00:35:18.84 --> 00:35:20.84 It's very similar to Norfolk
00:35:21.40 --> 00:35:24.84 And the sense of huge ship building town depressed economies
00:35:24.84 --> 00:35:32.04 Because most of the ships at the back at least early on a lot of the shipyards
00:35:32.60 --> 00:35:36.44 For the United Kingdom all the boats really built right there in in Glasgow
00:35:37.32 --> 00:35:44.36 And so of course that's where they select me to go and so I ended I wish I'd gone to Cambridge or Oxford or one of these places
00:35:44.36 --> 00:35:48.52 So I've course ended up my luck going to University of Glasgow, but hey man it was free
00:35:49.96 --> 00:35:51.96 So I went so off I go to
00:35:51.96 --> 00:35:58.44 University of Glasgow in Scotland and and and yeah that that that was a good experience I
00:35:59.72 --> 00:36:04.76 School was like 14 91 it was found I mean so it's it's you going way back right and
00:36:05.48 --> 00:36:07.48 Definitely back in the day
00:36:08.28 --> 00:36:14.52 My classmates you love this one my classmates were really it's an international program so my classmates from around the world right so
00:36:15.32 --> 00:36:20.28 my my roommate was a fellow named Carl Howe who's from Barbados and
00:36:20.28 --> 00:36:24.28 You know he he spoke a different dialect of English
00:36:24.84 --> 00:36:29.08 um and then I don't know if you've been to Glasgow but glass weegin
00:36:30.36 --> 00:36:35.48 Obviously English but their accent are so thick so imagine I'm where I got this dude from Barbados
00:36:36.36 --> 00:36:39.08 Me and all these glass weegins
00:36:39.08 --> 00:36:42.44 I guess it's they're all speaking the same language but they're in the same
00:36:44.04 --> 00:36:48.60 So I did I did the masters program there in international finance
00:36:48.60 --> 00:36:52.92 I've really wanted to get out of there so I did my program pretty fast I did it in
00:36:53.48 --> 00:36:56.92 18 months I could write your dissertation finish and so I finished
00:36:58.76 --> 00:37:03.80 But because I finished early I came back to the states and and at that point
00:37:04.12 --> 00:37:08.04 Jock I I I wanted to be I thought an investment banker so
00:37:08.68 --> 00:37:13.08 For your listeners out there not to offend many investment bankers, but so investment bankers put
00:37:13.08 --> 00:37:20.12 buyers and sellers of companies together I have a lot of investment banking friends
00:37:20.12 --> 00:37:22.76 I apologize for this but they're like real estate agents
00:37:24.12 --> 00:37:26.12 But really smart and they make a ton of dough
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000 So at my mind I wanted to be an investment banker you know kind of facilitating
00:37:32.20 --> 00:37:37.000 Acquisitions and putting buyers and sellers to together for for for businesses and so
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.56 Going back to the states I was all cycle so they have a recruiting class so they they bring in students and put them in the
00:37:43.56 --> 00:37:47.08 Associate program after they get their MBA which my degree was equivalent to that
00:37:47.88 --> 00:37:50.84 And so I was kind of six seven months early for that program
00:37:52.04 --> 00:37:57.08 And say said hey just come back when we recruit for the program because it's kind of a couple of your program
00:37:57.08 --> 00:38:00.04 You got to get get a spot a slot and you'll go through the program
00:38:00.92 --> 00:38:05.56 And so I called Bob because I didn't have a job and I said hey Mr. Hadjir Guess who he says hey Malay
00:38:05.56 --> 00:38:11.40 What so I wrote this dissertation on derivatives and in graduate school and so I went to work briefly
00:38:12.44 --> 00:38:18.04 For this insurance company and I I'd literally wrote what's called exogenous for his models why I would
00:38:18.44 --> 00:38:23.16 Invertly correlate commodity prices and self insurance levels
00:38:23.72 --> 00:38:28.36 It's very technical very boring, but we both seen trading places so we come here
00:38:28.36 --> 00:38:35.32 Yeah, so I literally would build these models you got here. I literally is building these models
00:38:36.44 --> 00:38:38.44 So a lot of big companies are self-insured
00:38:39.56 --> 00:38:45.96 Some companies have massive exposure to their earnings based on a commodity price of something so like take Reynolds models for example
00:38:45.96 --> 00:38:50.04 So Reynolds models their earnings are probably driven by the commodity price of aluminum
00:38:51.24 --> 00:38:53.48 Well if you're self-insured to some level and
00:38:53.48 --> 00:39:01.08 And aluminum prices go through the roof you had taken more more risk so we kind of wrote these and developed these models
00:39:01.56 --> 00:39:07.24 The reviter products that as the commodity price of in this case aluminum would go up
00:39:07.80 --> 00:39:13.32 Your insurance would kick in so yourself insurance would go down so it allowed the company to have less risk
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.96 Yeah, I I realized in about a month. This is really cool, but it ain't for man. That's a no cube doing modeling for my career, right?
00:39:21.96 --> 00:39:23.96 So I say hey Mr. Hatch, thanks for the look
00:39:24.68 --> 00:39:29.24 So I can't do this. I'll wait out for the program that I'm gonna go to
00:39:30.36 --> 00:39:39.72 somewhere else so he he actually called the this fellow that ran this investment bank and and today you get malone on board until he gets to the associate program at your investment thing
00:39:40.68 --> 00:39:42.68 And so I went but again early
00:39:43.16 --> 00:39:45.16 They were in the middle of a big project and
00:39:45.16 --> 00:39:51.80 And they he I was I joined this project so it was kind of like process reengineering
00:39:52.68 --> 00:39:59.56 But it was this is that a new company that you're working out. Yeah, so I left I left Johnson Higgins and went to it's called wheat first
00:39:59.56 --> 00:40:02.76 Birch or sing it's no longer there. Someone bought it. I walk over you. I think bought it
00:40:04.36 --> 00:40:11.96 But imagine clearing trades again. I'm very very exciting stuff, right so imagine how broker dealers clear trades literally clear trades
00:40:11.96 --> 00:40:16.28 You know equity trades are cleared but also you know
00:40:16.52 --> 00:40:24.20 Municipal bond trades how the technology works and how the processes and the regulation around clearing those trades and how these systems have to work together
00:40:24.76 --> 00:40:32.60 To do that and they had they had they had started clearing trades for a bunch of different mama pop broker dealers and some big ones and so
00:40:32.76 --> 00:40:37.08 You know think about it from a business standpoint. They were bringing in all different types of
00:40:37.08 --> 00:40:43.56 People to do trade businesses to do trade so if the three of us start our broker dealer we would hired them
00:40:43.56 --> 00:40:47.96 They do all our back-end stuff as big as you know the big guys on the street
00:40:48.76 --> 00:40:50.76 First clearing corpus the name of it
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000 What they would do their work too
00:40:53.40 --> 00:40:57.72 Well, anyway, I got into this project to figure out how to make that more for business and things like that again
00:40:57.80 --> 00:40:59.80 Just waiting out to get to the investment banking
00:40:59.80 --> 00:41:04.04 But I actually started to fall in love with the operational component of what we were building and
00:41:04.04 --> 00:41:11.08 And you know I actually made the decision and to decide not to go into investment banking at that point
00:41:11.08 --> 00:41:12.04 And the the
00:41:12.44 --> 00:41:17.64 The consulting firm that was kind of leading that project strategy consulting firm called Ernst and young at the time
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.28 They hired me to to work with them on doing these types of projects and so I joined them
00:41:27.56 --> 00:41:31.32 So I kind of left the guys hanging there in a investment banking, but it's the right choice for me
00:41:31.32 --> 00:41:36.04 I just I didn't I didn't want to be transactional that makes sense. I didn't want to be a middle man
00:41:36.04 --> 00:41:41.000 I just didn't want to be in the middle. I wanted to be building things and and I thought
00:41:42.04 --> 00:41:46.68 Giving giving input and value to what I was doing and so fast word
00:41:48.12 --> 00:41:51.80 Join on to the young they said hey you can go to New York or San Francisco and and
00:41:52.76 --> 00:41:55.88 That's where they had their offices and so I went to San Francisco
00:41:56.44 --> 00:41:59.24 Not a big fan of New York and I've been there one time
00:41:59.24 --> 00:42:02.92 To be fair so when I when I interviewed for the job with Mr. Hatcher
00:42:03.40 --> 00:42:08.36 They had this big sky rise down in New York right so you go and they have what's called an executive
00:42:09.08 --> 00:42:11.08 Dining room
00:42:11.08 --> 00:42:13.88 Okay, and they all were white shirts and ties
00:42:13.88 --> 00:42:19.40 I never I just like on the 44 some big high rise and I was going through this executive dining hall
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:23.56 That's when I knew I didn't want to have an executive dining hall
00:42:24.92 --> 00:42:28.04 So anyway, so and I hated New York
00:42:28.04 --> 00:42:32.60 So I moved we moved to San Francisco and and started my career there and and
00:42:33.24 --> 00:42:34.76 Can and when the
00:42:35.16 --> 00:42:42.20 Biggest mentors that I met in my life was surely thereafter was a guy that was the COO over the NASDAQ stock market
00:42:43.40 --> 00:42:49.48 Guy named Pat Campbell also surveyed of worse, but he'd kind of took me under his wing and at the time the NASDAQ
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:56.12 Was was on a buying bench they were trying to buy up stock exchanges and they bought the American stock exchange
00:42:56.12 --> 00:42:59.80 Which is really an option exchange and and I work for him
00:43:01.32 --> 00:43:06.92 As Ernst and young doing what's called post merger and a duration PMI so emerging these two companies together and it was
00:43:07.64 --> 00:43:09.64 Okay, it was fun
00:43:10.68 --> 00:43:13.000 Putting two companies together understanding how that works
00:43:13.64 --> 00:43:17.72 Frankly we do that now groundwork so that was that was that was a good learning process for me
00:43:17.72 --> 00:43:25.32 And then a few years later not even a few years later maybe 18 months later. I got this call from my friend Bob Hatcher
00:43:25.96 --> 00:43:29.08 He's and he says hey Malone I want you go meet a guy
00:43:30.20 --> 00:43:35.000 And I said yes or Mr. Hash whatever you want you this guy's he's really helped me and
00:43:36.04 --> 00:43:38.04 So I'm living in San Francisco
00:43:38.36 --> 00:43:40.84 He says how need you go to San Diego go meet him in San Diego?
00:43:41.72 --> 00:43:45.64 Are you communicating with him on a regular basis ever? No, he just reaching out to you
00:43:45.64 --> 00:43:46.44 Yeah
00:43:46.44 --> 00:43:48.44 So he just made such a good impression over
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.24 Pouring him scotch over those years
00:43:51.48 --> 00:43:56.68 Whatever gigs you did form you did a good job built a good relationship with him and you liked you
00:43:57.24 --> 00:43:59.64 I think so I think he identified with being
00:44:00.28 --> 00:44:02.28 He just loved scrappy
00:44:02.28 --> 00:44:07.40 grinders. I mean to be fair that's that's what it was he just he I think he saw himself and me
00:44:08.20 --> 00:44:10.76 And when you see you see the light kinded
00:44:10.76 --> 00:44:17.96 Young guys you you want help and I think this was this is his way of helping now mind you his way of helping was just a little
00:44:17.96 --> 00:44:19.72 push and a little nod like he didn't
00:44:20.60 --> 00:44:27.000 Make it happen all they made in some cases he did but he didn't you know he he was just he was there to help push and prod and
00:44:28.04 --> 00:44:30.68 Look at change the course of my life this one guy
00:44:31.88 --> 00:44:34.84 Where I was tendon bar in some college to try to pay my way and
00:44:34.84 --> 00:44:39.40 And change the trajectory of my whole life and
00:44:39.80 --> 00:44:44.04 Anyway, so he calls jockey calls of course I'd never been to San Diego
00:44:44.60 --> 00:44:48.20 San Diego is good to me like I've been here a couple times and big things happen when I get here
00:44:48.92 --> 00:44:55.16 So so I hop on the flight from San Francisco and you know this was again this was probably
00:44:56.04 --> 00:44:57.40 in
00:44:57.40 --> 00:44:58.76 97
00:44:58.76 --> 00:45:01.16 Technology you know we'll have smartphones right
00:45:01.16 --> 00:45:05.000 It was I was going to meet a guy right so I get on I get in the yellow cab
00:45:05.72 --> 00:45:07.72 No, we've worked that time and
00:45:07.88 --> 00:45:13.48 And I give the driver the address and we're we're scooting along and he's like you sure this is the address
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:17.16 My kios this is the address. I checked us together. This is the address
00:45:17.96 --> 00:45:19.96 Sir five minutes later. He's like
00:45:20.92 --> 00:45:26.60 My driver suit on right mean the guy he says a hey bro. You sure this is the address and I'm like
00:45:26.60 --> 00:45:33.08 Uh, what's the only address I have why do you keep saying that he says well you're you're going to San Diego zoo
00:45:35.40 --> 00:45:41.16 Hi, Luis I said fucking Bob just punked me. You know, that's what I literally what I thought is okay
00:45:41.16 --> 00:45:46.28 That's the well look this is only address I have so I'm gonna continue on so we went to the San Diego Zoo when I got out and there's a
00:45:47.16 --> 00:45:53.40 This is in the evening times about five o'clock and people were leaving but there's a little side thing that they were having this event for
00:45:53.40 --> 00:45:58.76 And they had you know partitioned it off. I go there and I meet the guy I'm interviewing with
00:45:59.48 --> 00:46:05.24 Is name is Marvin Bush and Marvin is a son of 41 and the brother of 43
00:46:06.36 --> 00:46:12.52 And he owned a hedge fund in a private equity fund back in DC and Bob and he befriends and
00:46:13.64 --> 00:46:19.48 The way I understand the story that Marvin was at a party with him and Bob was an investor by the way in his firm called Winston partners
00:46:19.48 --> 00:46:27.24 And and Marvin was saying look I really I really need a young scrappy guy to come join my team boom
00:46:27.96 --> 00:46:30.20 And Bob says hey I got a guy
00:46:31.80 --> 00:46:34.84 So I go to San Diego. I of course I meet Marvin San Diego and
00:46:35.56 --> 00:46:40.12 Boom got the job and this was so this was in late nineties when so think about the so private equity
00:46:41.64 --> 00:46:47.80 At the time so private equity for your listener's so private equity is is is a unique category
00:46:47.80 --> 00:46:53.88 And the sense of it's an alternative investment category if you think if you think about why it even exists
00:46:54.52 --> 00:46:59.56 You know many of the investors in private equity tend to be pension funds and colleges and endowments
00:47:00.76 --> 00:47:02.52 And
00:47:02.52 --> 00:47:06.12 Just the unfunded liabilities for example with pension funds today
00:47:06.52 --> 00:47:09.80 So unfunded liabilities would be the difference between what they owe their
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.96 The folks at a part of that pension and what assets that they have
00:47:13.96 --> 00:47:17.96 There's always a big delta that they always have to pay out more than they have
00:47:18.52 --> 00:47:23.16 Because they're cost of medical and whatever the paying for a pension standpoint is hired in what they have
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:24.84 So they have to invest that money
00:47:25.08 --> 00:47:28.60 They invest that money in a lot of different vehicles including public markets
00:47:28.84 --> 00:47:32.60 But also private vehicles alternative vehicles of which
00:47:33.24 --> 00:47:35.24 Private equity is an alternative vehicle
00:47:35.88 --> 00:47:38.92 Like if you would have looked today, it's it's striking that the
00:47:38.92 --> 00:47:44.28 The unfunded liabilities for pension funds in the United States is something like 3.8 trillion
00:47:45.64 --> 00:47:49.96 So they're trying to make this up how they make this up they're making it up through hedge funds and private equity
00:47:50.04 --> 00:47:52.28 Where they get a outsized return
00:47:52.28 --> 00:47:55.08 Visa via the public markets or visa via
00:47:55.80 --> 00:47:57.80 You know bonds and
00:47:58.76 --> 00:48:03.96 So to grow that you've seen a private equity when I joined this private equity firm at Marvin was running
00:48:04.52 --> 00:48:05.88 So this would this would be
00:48:05.88 --> 00:48:11.64 1998 99 the number private equity firms at that time were under a thousand
00:48:12.84 --> 00:48:18.28 If you were to look at it today, there's there's somewhere around four thousand private equity firms
00:48:19.40 --> 00:48:23.24 And they got they manage five point eight trillion dollars
00:48:24.44 --> 00:48:27.24 So back when when I joined this private equity firm it was
00:48:27.88 --> 00:48:30.12 If there was a category but it was kind of new
00:48:30.60 --> 00:48:35.56 But I knew I wanted to be in it and by the way, so private equity and venture capital same category
00:48:35.56 --> 00:48:40.28 But different kind of investment focus growth capital is different than buy out things like that
00:48:40.92 --> 00:48:49.08 Well Winston was a buy out shop and a micro cap buy out shop which meant that they focused on company sub 50 million dollars until land surprise value
00:48:49.96 --> 00:48:51.000 Um
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 And he was looking to add
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.24 An analyst an associate to that team and
00:48:55.88 --> 00:48:59.72 You know he Bob mentioned you need to go hide this guy so move back to
00:49:00.36 --> 00:49:02.52 Just outside of Washington DC and mind you look
00:49:02.52 --> 00:49:06.20 This is kind of surreal for me, right so went to college
00:49:07.40 --> 00:49:10.68 Flying around with an asset to buy stock exchanges
00:49:11.32 --> 00:49:13.32 That's weird
00:49:13.32 --> 00:49:16.60 Then working for the presence brother, you know
00:49:17.32 --> 00:49:23.000 Super nice guy super smart hated politics but legitimate business man and learned a ton from him
00:49:24.20 --> 00:49:26.20 You know I get to this office
00:49:26.20 --> 00:49:35.16 And it's how to DC and McClan at the burlap made it this is like this is the pinnacle man like I grew up in ocean view, you know
00:49:35.72 --> 00:49:37.16 So um
00:49:37.16 --> 00:49:40.92 Couldn't afford to go anything so you're here and it's it's very surreal and I remember
00:49:42.68 --> 00:49:47.40 I made me three or four months into the job and I might might might drive my own office which would be a big deal
00:49:47.96 --> 00:49:49.96 more of and walks in
00:49:50.20 --> 00:49:55.08 And he sits down just just like this and he kind of sits back and he says
00:49:55.08 --> 00:50:00.12 Maddie like he called me Maddie don't call me that. But maybe you can get your monster, but
00:50:01.24 --> 00:50:02.76 This is a
00:50:02.76 --> 00:50:04.76 Maddie, do you trust me
00:50:06.04 --> 00:50:13.24 What do you think I said? Yep, I said no. Oh, I said no. I don't even know you
00:50:14.60 --> 00:50:15.24 And
00:50:15.24 --> 00:50:20.36 That was a turning point in my career in the sense that so that's why I was there is
00:50:20.36 --> 00:50:22.36 So
00:50:22.36 --> 00:50:26.52 So at this firm there are guys from Harvard business school and Wharton
00:50:27.96 --> 00:50:36.92 Double you know my dryboss was a guy named Steve Fry who I still work with today when to double UVA I mean the gentleman college is right and then got some knuckle dragger like me
00:50:37.72 --> 00:50:39.72 I college as you never heard of
00:50:40.60 --> 00:50:43.000 But what I think what Marvin wanted was a mutt
00:50:44.04 --> 00:50:45.16 And
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:49.40 What that means is and what I've later learned what that means is so a guy that will always speak the truth
00:50:49.40 --> 00:50:51.40 Whatever he believes the truth will be
00:50:52.52 --> 00:50:54.52 The truth is for him
00:50:54.52 --> 00:51:01.000 And I think he realized that I wasn't looking to climb the ladder like I wasn't just a yes man and I was just so raw
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:06.04 Either naive or stupid. I wanted to find it. I was just so raw
00:51:06.68 --> 00:51:11.24 He loved it and he he slapped a table walked out my office and said that's why you're my mud
00:51:12.68 --> 00:51:16.44 That was it right off this so um that's that was a
00:51:16.44 --> 00:51:18.44 They
00:51:17.80 --> 00:51:18.44 That yeah, I
00:51:19.08 --> 00:51:22.04 Retrospect you know that was a big turning point of my career
00:51:22.04 --> 00:51:26.52 He you know he involved me and everything and there was some trust there because I just wasn't one of those
00:51:26.52 --> 00:51:30.84 Yes men and I okay the guys that I worked a super smart super talented guys
00:51:32.12 --> 00:51:36.36 But I felt like I needed to stay there and earn my spots so I worked them and
00:51:37.80 --> 00:51:42.44 You know mom said a long time ago and I'm embarrassed to say this but she said honey
00:51:42.44 --> 00:51:47.16 You're not the smartest one they've ever created but if you work 10% harder you'll be just fine
00:51:47.88 --> 00:51:50.44 And that's literally how I've lived my whole life and my careers
00:51:50.44 --> 00:51:55.80 I will not be outworked in my mind right so I'll will not be outworked and so I always figured
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000 If I come in an hour before they do
00:51:59.80 --> 00:52:04.36 That you know that's that for me at that point that was five to six hours more a week if I stayed a
00:52:04.92 --> 00:52:08.76 An hour later you double that right at the end of the year effectively
00:52:09.08 --> 00:52:11.08 I gained a month of working time on them
00:52:11.08 --> 00:52:16.36 And you also set the tone right so you set the tone is that young guys here longer than me
00:52:16.92 --> 00:52:18.92 And that's another good message you know my
00:52:19.32 --> 00:52:23.80 My good friend and partner can make Donald we call a garden a castle. I still do it today
00:52:24.12 --> 00:52:26.12 So I like to be the first and in last out
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.84 Even at this big company that I run
00:52:29.56 --> 00:52:32.20 Because it sets the tone that you know, I'm not some
00:52:32.36 --> 00:52:35.08 Exactly that's gonna mail it in if we're gonna go after our mission
00:52:35.08 --> 00:52:38.12 We're gonna go after and I'm gonna be there to do it with you and so
00:52:38.12 --> 00:52:44.36 At once and I spent you know close to eight years there doing deals so private equity deals so we would buy companies
00:52:45.32 --> 00:52:50.04 And invest and I would not break them you know, so at this point is traditional private equity
00:52:50.12 --> 00:52:54.44 We'd buy these small companies we would invest in them sit on the boards
00:52:55.64 --> 00:52:57.000 You know try to
00:52:57.32 --> 00:53:04.52 Provide wisdom but and really I just really provide in capital and trying to direct them to good outcomes as as a business guy and so
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:06.52 I
00:53:06.52 --> 00:53:10.84 Enjoyed it. I loved and frankly I loved working with entrepreneurs because so these are small
00:53:11.40 --> 00:53:17.24 Companies right so you they're not as sophisticated as you get upstream you get large cat companies yet professional managers you have
00:53:18.68 --> 00:53:25.12 In a professional investment bankers that they're involved at this just you're still buying companies that's being operated by the founders
00:53:25.84 --> 00:53:29.64 100% and it was perver street fighters. I loved it
00:53:29.64 --> 00:53:35.80 You know with his no like Harvard MBA's running around kind of management they're guys literally
00:53:36.28 --> 00:53:40.36 Working you know if it's a construction company for example. They're literally driving hard equipment
00:53:40.36 --> 00:53:45.16 They're managing they're they're doing the work themselves while trying to manage the business and so
00:53:45.72 --> 00:53:48.20 I thought I could add value in many of those cases and and
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.68 That frankly is kind of where I cut my teeth for what I wanted to do learning and watching these founders and
00:53:54.76 --> 00:53:56.76 What I would pay them for their businesses?
00:53:56.76 --> 00:54:00.72 I would sit and oh my god, that's about to make you know 50 large and I
00:54:01.64 --> 00:54:10.08 Think I can do that you know you know and so I did that for a few years almost eight years great team great
00:54:10.32 --> 00:54:12.32 Marvin and I you know he's
00:54:13.68 --> 00:54:15.68 He took a chance on me
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:19.68 We didn't need to juggle in that guy
00:54:20.20 --> 00:54:25.92 You know you came to some great family, but this guy also he burned the midnight all and worked hard and it was a pleasure working for him
00:54:25.92 --> 00:54:27.92 But he comes in
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:33.12 He comes in one day and says hey, Matt, you might want to get your CV together. This is
00:54:34.32 --> 00:54:36.32 CV is fancy for resume and
00:54:38.40 --> 00:54:42.52 Like oh man something big's going on or I just got fired. I'm not sure which and
00:54:43.52 --> 00:54:48.48 Turned out they were he had a partner and they were separating the firm you know talk about you know
00:54:48.48 --> 00:54:51.64 Partnership sometimes don't last forever and so they were gonna separate the firm
00:54:51.64 --> 00:54:57.64 Never get this so I get up out of my sweet office and I walk down the hall to Marvin
00:54:57.64 --> 00:55:01.48 I said hey, Mar I think I'm gonna think I'm gonna go I think you know
00:55:01.48 --> 00:55:07.000 You don't want to be part of the firm that's kind of an indisiree and I said think I'm gonna go try something else
00:55:08.04 --> 00:55:11.36 He says he says Matt I knew you'd come down here and
00:55:13.32 --> 00:55:15.32 literally
00:55:15.32 --> 00:55:19.56 I ended up a couple days later meeting with a
00:55:19.56 --> 00:55:21.56 guy named
00:55:21.56 --> 00:55:28.16 Ray Hunt and Dallas so Ray Hunt is at the time was Fortune 50 which means
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:33.64 He's a 50 is one of the 50th richest richest bellas on the planet
00:55:34.32 --> 00:55:36.32 He owned a big all business
00:55:36.72 --> 00:55:40.52 But he also owned his own big all turnip investment group when you got that kind of money
00:55:41.72 --> 00:55:43.56 You invest your own money, right?
00:55:43.56 --> 00:55:50.48 So he had a team of folks that did all alternative investments so from real estate to venture capital to leverage buyout and
00:55:51.60 --> 00:55:53.60 I joined his leverage buyout team
00:55:54.84 --> 00:56:03.18 And was offered the opportunity to look all their offices weren't Dallas and and I was giving the opportunity to make open their first office outside of Dallas
00:56:03.40 --> 00:56:06.44 Which was a big deal. I was gonna build my own team leave my own deals
00:56:07.72 --> 00:56:13.28 And so you know I got to pick it land or Charlotte to do that and I opened my my office
00:56:13.28 --> 00:56:18.20 for Hunt private equity and and Charlotte North Carolina and did you know did some cool deals
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.94 It was fun again think about the progression here of
00:56:24.44 --> 00:56:28.60 Marvin to Ray and these are some you know players players
00:56:32.24 --> 00:56:35.12 Fast-word a few years as you this was then
00:56:35.12 --> 00:56:40.88 OA-09 the world's gone badly. Oh, yeah, so what was the how that all worked out?
00:56:40.88 --> 00:56:48.48 What we had at that time we only had three active portfolio companies we just started actively investing and and came all three of those were my companies
00:56:49.76 --> 00:56:52.16 And there was kind of this decision to make
00:56:53.40 --> 00:56:59.44 About what are we gonna do with these companies if things go really bad how are we gonna support them things like that and mind you hunt although
00:57:00.80 --> 00:57:07.08 Very wealthy he has other interests in particular energy and we're in energy company takes a lot of capital
00:57:07.08 --> 00:57:14.28 And so my here-brand ideas I was gonna buy the portfolio from Mr. Hunt and
00:57:16.28 --> 00:57:20.88 And so I I went down there and I offered to buy the portfolio and I
00:57:21.56 --> 00:57:25.08 He agreed and how did you structure that deal?
00:57:25.72 --> 00:57:30.20 So three active portfolio company, so I knew the enterprise values of all of them and mind you look
00:57:30.20 --> 00:57:32.70 I didn't have the money to do it. That's why I'm asking you how you structured
00:57:32.70 --> 00:57:35.94 You talk about hustling you'd love this jacket
00:57:35.94 --> 00:57:41.52 So so I got him a vertu agree to the deal right what was gonna be so total enterprise put them all together
00:57:41.52 --> 00:57:44.22 What the total purchase price would be what the return look like for him?
00:57:44.58 --> 00:57:47.06 We would take these portfolio companies into a new fund
00:57:48.30 --> 00:57:54.22 Now then I once you said yes, I was running around trying to raise the money first said investment vehicle
00:57:54.62 --> 00:57:57.94 To buy this portfolio. I got it so you did a little raise
00:57:59.22 --> 00:58:03.50 Attempted to do a little. I say because this is what 2008 2009. Yeah, you weren't raised in
00:58:03.50 --> 00:58:05.50 What
00:58:06.50 --> 00:58:10.98 Well the ironic thing is I I found that but the firms to back me
00:58:11.70 --> 00:58:17.12 We were gonna pull it off but the companies that we had invested in what performing so well
00:58:18.22 --> 00:58:21.42 literally these are these are kind of recession proof businesses that
00:58:22.58 --> 00:58:26.86 A billioners says no I had I'm deciding not to sell these companies. That's what he does
00:58:26.86 --> 00:58:32.34 And so he didn't we we couldn't able able to to pull off that transaction and mind you're not having money
00:58:32.34 --> 00:58:36.14 So I'm I've spent so he's so wait so he re-nigged a little bit
00:58:36.82 --> 00:58:38.82 I careful here
00:58:38.82 --> 00:58:40.82 He made a different decision
00:58:41.06 --> 00:58:44.14 He decided he's gonna keep them yes, sir got it yes, sir
00:58:44.62 --> 00:58:48.34 And he looked at the performance. He said man. I'm not losing money
00:58:48.34 --> 00:58:53.18 These things to last forever. I'm gonna keep them and so we did he did and so
00:58:53.82 --> 00:58:56.78 In vision this you when you go to your boss and say hey, I'm gonna take you out
00:58:56.78 --> 00:59:00.04 I want to take this in different strategy. I know the economy's terrible
00:59:00.04 --> 00:59:02.04 You're gonna focus on energy. I'm gonna buy this portfolio
00:59:02.84 --> 00:59:07.36 Doesn't but well for your career. So that was kind of my end of my career there at hunt
00:59:08.20 --> 00:59:14.44 So I had started this firm that I called at the time was doing the raise with these other private equity firms
00:59:15.56 --> 00:59:17.56 Called succession capital and
00:59:18.04 --> 00:59:22.52 It's a private equity firm I own today and and the the phrase succession literally means
00:59:22.52 --> 00:59:31.60 When you think about all the great businesses built by boomers of the last 50 years and I'd always thought to myself
00:59:31.60 --> 00:59:35.44 Look, I'm gonna have my private equity firm gonna buy my own companies and
00:59:36.28 --> 00:59:42.04 If you look at all the folks that needed to retire the boomers needed to retire and the data really is clear on this that
00:59:42.68 --> 00:59:50.12 Second second generation businesses never work 30% success rate third generation businesses around 12%
00:59:50.12 --> 00:59:57.60 Think that that's incredible right so you have all this wealth that's been created locked up in these businesses
00:59:58.60 --> 01:00:05.000 So we got the boomer creates the business. Yes, and that's business is doing great when that boomer steps away
01:00:05.60 --> 01:00:10.60 It's got a 30% chance to survival if you give it to your kids if you give it to your kids and if that
01:00:11.48 --> 01:00:14.92 Survives you got a 12 even to go to the next set of kids
01:00:14.92 --> 01:00:21.68 The 12th classic classic we see this over and over again, right right? Well look, they don't work to get it
01:00:21.68 --> 01:00:25.08 Yeah, they never struggle they never went through everything that's required to get it
01:00:25.08 --> 01:00:30.92 Right, so hey, man if you if daddy gives you a business you just show up the business starts interfering with my golf game
01:00:30.92 --> 01:00:32.92 Exactly
01:00:33.92 --> 01:00:38.60 So that was kind of my mindset is like you have all this pent up value in these companies and small companies
01:00:38.60 --> 01:00:44.000 And that I would just go and buy them and allow that owner to monetize their life's work
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000 And
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.16 And some of this you you probably recognize just some of the smart business owners
01:00:50.16 --> 01:00:56.68 They know they're not given it to their kids. Yeah, we see it every day today and some of the businesses that I buy not that they're bad kids
01:00:56.68 --> 01:00:58.68 But they're not going to run a business
01:00:58.68 --> 01:01:05.20 They're not going to run a business and the owner the person that built it they want the money to live whatever lifestyle
01:01:05.20 --> 01:01:06.20 They have left
01:01:06.20 --> 01:01:10.76 They don't want the company to slowly pay them out because think about this how would a kid buy a business?
01:01:10.76 --> 01:01:16.76 Well, one of the way to do it is that the company that they were given finances that exit for the for the parents
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.48 Well, you can't fly around the world enjoying life if that's how it's done and so my pitch to some of these owners was hey look
01:01:25.04 --> 01:01:31.52 Succession will buy you I'll lie you to man, you know monetize that great build and they go live your life and do your thing and
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:35.64 So that that notion was was was always in my mind
01:01:35.64 --> 01:01:40.68 After you know doing private equity at that point for you know 15 years a 13 years or something like that
01:01:40.92 --> 01:01:46.60 It was always in my mind and then the event at hunt kind of catapult that right into existence
01:01:47.60 --> 01:01:53.56 I formed it I was gonna put these three portfolio companies and then and you know I ran around spend you know
01:01:53.56 --> 01:01:57.48 I don't know hundred fifty thousand dollars of my own money trying to get this thing off the ground
01:01:58.76 --> 01:02:03.36 And you know, of course that's all zeroed out at that point because we couldn't buy the portfolio
01:02:03.36 --> 01:02:05.36 And so here I am in Charlotte
01:02:06.64 --> 01:02:11.96 Had enough money to kind of keep me plugging away for a maybe a year 15 months
01:02:12.44 --> 01:02:17.36 My goal was to find try to find a company. That's what I was gonna. You're still sitting on the money that you raised no no no
01:02:17.36 --> 01:02:21.72 Okay, you didn't do it never close never close to God. We turned the purchase agreement twice
01:02:22.56 --> 01:02:24.56 That's a tough one
01:02:26.56 --> 01:02:28.56 Yeah, anyway
01:02:28.56 --> 01:02:36.20 Hey good lesson never go against the beaner. I've done that twice in my career and I've definitely lost twice
01:02:37.44 --> 01:02:43.36 So I'm a slow learner sometimes I guess so I'm sitting there in Charlotte trying to find businesses
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:45.84 And the problem the Charlotte's a great city the problem in Charlotte though
01:02:45.84 --> 01:02:50.92 It's full of you know commercial bankers and investment bankers that all are looking to for little businesses
01:02:50.92 --> 01:02:54.24 They can buy so they can and they're might have lifestyle businesses right?
01:02:54.24 --> 01:02:56.88 So it's a pretty competitive find at business in that market
01:02:56.88 --> 01:02:58.88 As I'm looking for businesses
01:02:59.60 --> 01:03:01.60 I had friend
01:03:01.60 --> 01:03:03.60 Jimmy Flowers that
01:03:03.60 --> 01:03:06.80 That you know we had bought one piece of real estate jaco that
01:03:07.28 --> 01:03:12.84 So while COVID was melting down this point so this was like during the Great Recession right and so while COVID is what year we talking?
01:03:12.84 --> 01:03:14.84 A O 809 okay
01:03:16.12 --> 01:03:21.28 Ruff brutal right so I try to make it run the portfolio got nothing and you know
01:03:21.28 --> 01:03:24.000 I really can't really get a job. I could get a job
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.36 I'd suffice to get a job, you know, I'm gonna make a run at this so I'm looking at myself
01:03:28.36 --> 01:03:30.48 Can't married at this point. Yeah your kids?
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:35.36 Yeah my my son ate in Malone is uh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's it's not fun
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:39.12 Yeah, because I mean you can just get away with anything when you're saying go no kids
01:03:39.12 --> 01:03:41.44 You're like a cool. I'll sleep you know
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:45.76 I'll sleep in the van. It's all good. We can make a work when you've got the wife and kids
01:03:45.88 --> 01:03:51.20 You know the phrase burn the boats. Yeah. Yeah, man. That was it like I was I was not gonna lose now
01:03:51.20 --> 01:03:53.36 I don't have a path to like where that was going
01:03:53.36 --> 01:03:58.96 Yeah, I've had that discussion I had that discussion with my wife and I've told people about this
01:03:58.96 --> 01:04:07.44 You got to figure out what your minimum standard is and you got to figure out what your wife's minimum standard is and I had the conversation with my wife a few times
01:04:08.40 --> 01:04:11.28 Where I was saying look if this doesn't work
01:04:12.56 --> 01:04:18.72 I'm good with living in our RV and we're gonna travel up and down the coast California
01:04:18.72 --> 01:04:22.24 I'm gonna surf and we're gonna hang out. We're gonna go to a bunch of different jutsu schools and
01:04:22.24 --> 01:04:27.60 We'll live off my Navy retirement and I'm good with that. I need to check if you're good with that
01:04:27.60 --> 01:04:30.96 She's like oh, it sounds good and sounds like fun. I'll get to see you more and I was like okay cool
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.44 You got to figure out what that minimum standard is gonna be because if the minimum standard is hey
01:04:35.44 --> 01:04:39.92 I at least need a house or I at least need a house, you know with three bedroom
01:04:39.92 --> 01:04:41.92 So or for what's the minimum standard?
01:04:41.92 --> 01:04:47.28 You gotta have that conversation sometimes and I gave this advice on on the academy the other day someone was asking about
01:04:47.28 --> 01:04:48.80 You know, I'm going through this transition period
01:04:48.80 --> 01:04:54.000 How do I address it with my wife and I said look you're gonna take risk not just with you
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.84 But it's with your wife figure out what the minimum standard is and then make your decisions and and that you have a lot
01:04:59.84 --> 01:05:04.000 Your minimum standard is a lot lower would you know so low dude, right?
01:05:04.08 --> 01:05:05.76 You're flying like there is no minimum
01:05:05.76 --> 01:05:09.84 I really didn't even have a minimum standard as a person right as an individual
01:05:09.84 --> 01:05:14.88 I had no minimum standard. I could survive literally. Yeah, yeah, well we'll get it done
01:05:15.44 --> 01:05:17.84 But figure out what that minimum standard is so
01:05:17.84 --> 01:05:20.56 So so you had your wife you had kids
01:05:21.36 --> 01:05:24.80 So my wife or your wife okay with living a van down by the river she would have been
01:05:24.80 --> 01:05:31.36 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about she's right or die best thing that happened to me so Sarah's is all in she's always been all in
01:05:32.56 --> 01:05:38.32 Yeah, you need that when you do when you you know it looks from now you look back and say oh yeah easy life right
01:05:38.32 --> 01:05:40.32 Because I've been pretty successful today, but
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:48.000 But I can today it was it was it was not always this rosy and then you know her being you know
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.52 100% supportive
01:05:49.52 --> 01:05:53.76 It tells you everything you need to know when when when when things are hitting everything is great
01:05:53.76 --> 01:05:57.44 It's easy to have a relationship right but when things are bad and you don't know
01:05:58.48 --> 01:06:02.16 And we had some money more than living on the street, but you know it was it was running out fast
01:06:02.16 --> 01:06:03.20 Christmas
01:06:03.20 --> 01:06:04.000 Yeah
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000 I'm breaking out the spam hey mom what's that recipe
01:06:07.92 --> 01:06:08.96 So
01:06:08.96 --> 01:06:13.76 You know, I'm just again at this point just scrapping right I'm hustling like like nobody's business and
01:06:14.56 --> 01:06:17.92 We're sitting there we're looking for businesses and and we get a call from
01:06:20.48 --> 01:06:27.12 I fell of that a family office in Chicago Bayonair that had put a lot of money in a mess fund
01:06:27.52 --> 01:06:32.96 So a mess fund for your listeners is you know you got you got your additional equity where you you you put in your money
01:06:32.96 --> 01:06:37.92 You don't get a kind of dividend or annual return you get the upside in the game
01:06:37.92 --> 01:06:44.16 Dead of course is your traditional debt we have to pay some kind of interest on it. Mez is in between
01:06:44.16 --> 01:06:49.92 Well, you have a mezzanine strip or mezzanette where you get an elevated dividend
01:06:50.08 --> 01:06:55.04 So it's it's higher than I bank the risk is higher to what you pay more than a bank you'd have to
01:06:55.36 --> 01:07:01.12 Charge bank or bank would charge you but you also get a little bit of equity upside it was it's popular in real estate so
01:07:02.32 --> 01:07:03.68 He calls
01:07:03.68 --> 01:07:08.32 My friend Jimmy gets the thing it says the call and says hey, yeah, we're good
01:07:08.64 --> 01:07:10.84 They knew Jimmy and they said hey look we have this
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:17.60 Mezzan investment in this fund and this and they they're holding this thing at cost which this thing would be this
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:23.92 Big building and Shirley was charlotte it was was a big construction project they had and if you're in
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:26.96 Oh nine and oh wait if you're holding something at cost you're blind
01:07:26.96 --> 01:07:32.72 Because because they're saying hey look you put ten million dollars into this we're telling you it's still worth ten
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:35.84 So the guy calls and says hey flowers
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:39.52 They were ten so
01:07:40.24 --> 01:07:44.08 Fires the table on this go check this out so we help them to hop into truck we drive this building
01:07:44.72 --> 01:07:48.16 We look at the hundred nine unit building and and it's literally empty
01:07:48.56 --> 01:07:53.44 It's literally like residential like residential multi-family residential condo development
01:07:53.44 --> 01:07:55.44 Mm-hmm so
01:07:55.44 --> 01:07:59.84 We're looking at each other and with of course we're scrappers like how we monetize us
01:07:59.84 --> 01:08:01.84 Yeah, you look at that
01:08:01.84 --> 01:08:03.84 They like the hammer this is
01:08:05.28 --> 01:08:07.28 I don't know much about real estate, but I do now
01:08:08.56 --> 01:08:13.36 So we looked in James that we'll just get a fee we can help this guy that that that that that that that that's it now
01:08:13.36 --> 01:08:14.72 No, no, we're gonna
01:08:14.88 --> 01:08:18.32 We do something different so I call the guy that I knew in town
01:08:18.32 --> 01:08:23.68 Um, uh, that is the project done done oh worst case in there, right?
01:08:23.68 --> 01:08:30.24 So if it's in construction you kind of delay it a little bit so that you can finish it and sell an optimal price as as the economy recovers
01:08:31.04 --> 01:08:35.76 This came online the average square foot cost of this building was likely three X
01:08:36.64 --> 01:08:40.80 Overvalued so if you're buying a condo and trial at this point in your pain this price your
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:47.20 Your your full it's it's three X to expensive which means by the way your your mesdez and your equity prior word nothing
01:08:48.24 --> 01:08:51.76 So we do this work and we call the guys back and say
01:08:52.16 --> 01:08:54.16 Pay listen, uh, we'll come see you tomorrow
01:08:54.72 --> 01:08:59.76 Now mind you broke again. We're flying coach to Charlotte back at the bus right next to the lab and it's
01:09:00.16 --> 01:09:03.04 We're we're getting up there and I put this big proposal together and
01:09:03.68 --> 01:09:06.56 So we get up there and and our pitch was simply this hey look
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:14.32 Um, I had met the guy uh that night I called the banker that I knew who actually was banking the deal from a senior perspective
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:22.08 And he he control the debt and he shared with me hey where sellers of this debt and I offered him on the phone a number
01:09:25.44 --> 01:09:29.12 Mind you I didn't have them then money to do it, but I said okay. I'll pay you this for it
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:31.12 He said we're done. I said we're good. We're good. I said okay
01:09:31.12 --> 01:09:38.24 Next time on the plane going up to see these big in errors and our pitch was simply this let's do your mesdus word zero
01:09:38.72 --> 01:09:40.96 The good news is that we're gonna buy this note
01:09:41.60 --> 01:09:45.12 We're capitalized a little more and we'll buy this asset here's what your return will be
01:09:45.84 --> 01:09:49.60 You give me 18 months to sell off this repricely asset
01:09:50.48 --> 01:09:55.92 And you give me a some runway to start marketing this building you can make a great return
01:09:55.92 --> 01:10:00.56 Cavly out being we're gonna share profits. I'll do all the work
01:10:01.36 --> 01:10:03.36 I'll literally sell the units myself
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:06.08 With my partner Jimmy at that time and
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:09.20 They agreed
01:10:09.20 --> 01:10:13.36 Now mind you like I don't know anything about real estate this time is a PE guy, but I could learn pretty fast
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:18.88 No offenses not that complicated, right? So we got effort so our first big project access session was really
01:10:19.52 --> 01:10:23.12 A real estate project so we dispose of all those assets made a lot of money and
01:10:23.12 --> 01:10:25.12 And
01:10:25.36 --> 01:10:29.52 Second lesson from a billionaire so we're making so much money the final payment
01:10:30.40 --> 01:10:31.76 The guy calls us and says hey
01:10:32.72 --> 01:10:34.72 You guys are making too much money
01:10:34.88 --> 01:10:38.80 We're like hey, well, that's that's your agreement. We're gonna share the profits. We put in the work
01:10:38.80 --> 01:10:44.48 You know we're roughly roughly 19 months of hard labor to sell these units a hundred nine unit building
01:10:45.60 --> 01:10:47.60 And he said no no I want another half a million
01:10:49.68 --> 01:10:51.68 So what do you say?
01:10:51.68 --> 01:10:57.04 Yes, sir. I mean what are you gonna do? He literally said look I'll I'll tie up in core for five years you'll never see that money like
01:10:57.76 --> 01:11:01.20 Okay, well there you go. So another lesson hard lesson
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.40 But we did that that frankly helped me capitalize
01:11:04.56 --> 01:11:08.08 Succession and allowed me to kind of push our our model to wear this today
01:11:08.08 --> 01:11:12.24 I knew I didn't want to be in the real estate game although we have a real estate division today and
01:11:12.24 --> 01:11:14.24 comproducing properties
01:11:14.24 --> 01:11:17.12 We have about 30 and comproducing properties today
01:11:17.12 --> 01:11:24.56 It's a great business Jimmy fire's my part to run some real estate component of that, but my passion is operating companies and so
01:11:25.20 --> 01:11:29.84 We're now having a little bit of capital and you know no lean Christmas at least that year
01:11:31.52 --> 01:11:37.12 We I found a company so ultimately found a company back in Norfolk that was called petrochem
01:11:38.08 --> 01:11:43.68 Recovery I bought this business from the Fensca family super family. It was the environmental services space
01:11:43.68 --> 01:11:49.76 So think anything that can't go in a water treatment facility or landfill this company would clean up and dispose of
01:11:51.12 --> 01:11:54.24 Great family great business not as you can I don't know anything about that either
01:11:54.64 --> 01:11:59.28 But literally I wanted to cut my teeth on being a true operator so bought the company 23 employees
01:12:00.88 --> 01:12:02.56 Literally a thousand square foot office
01:12:03.52 --> 01:12:08.000 Mind you so think about this I'm flying around a private plane's working with some the biggest guys in the world
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.04 Now I'm in Norfolk at 1635 Mopiav a new thousand square foot building
01:12:13.68 --> 01:12:18.72 Moving houses are swaced around my office literally was like it has like the
01:12:19.52 --> 01:12:23.84 The old wooden plywood would like then not real wood like the plywood stuff
01:12:24.80 --> 01:12:28.000 Like wood paneling yeah wood paneling right like you'd see like
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:30.64 70s and stuff right yes
01:12:31.52 --> 01:12:37.12 So you know that's literally where my office was and and right next door to that was the shitter so it's always a good morning
01:12:37.12 --> 01:12:39.12 When you have 23 people using one bathroom, but
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:45.36 But you know, I loved it loved every minute of it so I got my has water certification
01:12:45.36 --> 01:12:48.40 Learn to drive a vactruck if necessary although rarely
01:12:49.84 --> 01:12:54.72 But I was able to at that point engage in a business from operational standpoint
01:12:55.60 --> 01:13:01.84 leverage everything that I'd learned in private equity over the years in terms of investing in process technology people
01:13:01.84 --> 01:13:05.84 And
01:13:05.84 --> 01:13:07.84 Started to realize the importance of
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.000 Investing in skill tradesmen and women and it wasn't really till I got there that I realized it deficit in the country as it relates to skill trades now
01:13:18.80 --> 01:13:21.76 We'll talk a little bit about that a minute, but so built that company
01:13:23.04 --> 01:13:25.52 We actually tripled that business in about two years
01:13:26.24 --> 01:13:29.68 Making so much money from that business that I was able to buy another company
01:13:29.68 --> 01:13:35.68 Called shipyard staffing so that that business is skill trade labor to the shipyards
01:13:36.72 --> 01:13:43.92 So we we initial business we eyeball was little we rebranded it to shipyard staffing get true skill trade
01:13:43.92 --> 01:13:46.96 So I think welders, pipe fitters shipbuilders shipfitters
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:54.80 Great men and women so this company would provide temporary skill labor to the shipyards as they would build
01:13:55.36 --> 01:13:57.36 You know boats
01:13:57.36 --> 01:14:00.64 For your listeners out there like when you build a an navy vessel
01:14:01.04 --> 01:14:09.12 There's a lot of peak demand for labor at certain points of the construction and so what what companies like ours would do provide that peak labor to allow them to
01:14:09.28 --> 01:14:11.76 Continual production and do it a more efficient manner
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.32 So build that bought that business built it we opened up. We had office in Norfolk
01:14:18.64 --> 01:14:20.96 Newport news where they built all the aircraft carriers as you know
01:14:20.96 --> 01:14:27.36 We opened up in Jacksonville, Florida another navy base. We opened up here in San Diego the last time I was in San Diego
01:14:27.36 --> 01:14:29.36 I signed a lease for a property down the road
01:14:30.64 --> 01:14:35.12 So it's been good to me and then Bremerton which is near Seattle
01:14:37.12 --> 01:14:39.12 That business again
01:14:39.12 --> 01:14:45.52 For me, it's really showed me that the deficit of skill tradesmen and women in this country is a problem
01:14:45.52 --> 01:14:52.64 For for not only my business, but for the country so the average age of a welder for us was like 54
01:14:54.96 --> 01:15:00.48 Think about that for one second like if you think about how this country is going to protect itself and build and and repair
01:15:01.04 --> 01:15:03.04 It just our worships
01:15:03.04 --> 01:15:06.96 in our aging workforce. What are we going to do in 10 years?
01:15:09.52 --> 01:15:11.12 It's a real
01:15:11.12 --> 01:15:13.52 National security issue that no one really talks about. I think
01:15:13.52 --> 01:15:16.08 We could talk a lot about this, but
01:15:17.28 --> 01:15:23.60 You know the push for college of the last 20 30 years and if you look at the stats I think since 1990
01:15:24.40 --> 01:15:26.40 College enrollments up 60%
01:15:27.28 --> 01:15:31.04 Cost adjusted for inflation is up like 300%
01:15:31.68 --> 01:15:33.68 Subsidized 100%
01:15:33.68 --> 01:15:38.80 Subsidized by the government and making loans just like just like the mortgage just like the mortgage crash
01:15:39.12 --> 01:15:41.12 They're making loans to people
01:15:41.12 --> 01:15:43.12 That
01:15:43.12 --> 01:15:46.48 Not necessarily can be able to pay those loans back because you go to college for four years and it cost
01:15:47.12 --> 01:15:51.20 $380,000 and the job that you get with your degree when you leave that school is a
01:15:51.60 --> 01:15:53.44 $32,000 or $38,000
01:15:53.44 --> 01:15:55.44 Your job that's what that's what's happening
01:15:55.84 --> 01:16:03.28 So it's a disaster and there's an impending cliff here and I know you feel strongly about bringing manufacturing back to the United States
01:16:03.28 --> 01:16:09.44 If we don't start building skill trades and a women in this country there will be a colossal collapse
01:16:10.88 --> 01:16:14.56 Think about everything we do like all these great high-tech companies and everything they do
01:16:14.56 --> 01:16:21.04 Well someone's got to run the electrical electrician lines there or the gas lines there or build those skyscrapers or whatever it might be
01:16:21.76 --> 01:16:25.44 The blue collar skill trade men and women in this country have been forgotten and
01:16:26.32 --> 01:16:31.12 You know it really came to roost for me as we started build now a shipyard staffing because the age
01:16:31.12 --> 01:16:39.84 Really scared me right and so crazy look our strategy there pretty simple so I I got a secret clearance there so I
01:16:40.08 --> 01:16:44.96 Through my company my idea was to provide skill trade labor to
01:16:46.24 --> 01:16:49.36 You know true US Navy shipyards and nuclear vessels
01:16:50.24 --> 01:16:54.16 So I could pay my guys more we could grow our business and that's what we did so we grew that business
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:59.28 We caught quadrupled that business and pretty fast which is great we opened it as you know a bunch of new offices
01:16:59.28 --> 01:17:01.28 And
01:17:01.84 --> 01:17:08.000 Like I the course and I I thought hey man. I'm I'm building some great value in these portfolio companies. I'm having fun
01:17:09.12 --> 01:17:11.52 And then I and then I met a guy that
01:17:13.12 --> 01:17:16.24 Kind of changed the course of my career as we got into groundwork
01:17:16.24 --> 01:17:22.08 So I friend of mine calls and says hey, listen, I build this software company and I like to pitch you on the idea
01:17:22.64 --> 01:17:26.64 Me you and some other guys and I went to college with this guy and I say bro
01:17:26.64 --> 01:17:31.20 I'm never gonna invest with you. You know you know you and one of those guys. I could guy but never gonna put my money behind
01:17:31.20 --> 01:17:34.40 And plus I what do I know about software? I'm a blue collar investor
01:17:34.40 --> 01:17:37.36 I I like to invest in companies that actually do things
01:17:38.16 --> 01:17:42.32 Manufacturer things are service things or those types of things and so
01:17:43.20 --> 01:17:47.36 I go because I know all my friends. I go I go to this big fancy you know
01:17:48.24 --> 01:17:50.24 Conference room and I walk in and
01:17:50.24 --> 01:17:55.76 Is a guy sitting next to me and is a tax account and I'm like
01:17:56.56 --> 01:17:59.84 Hey bro, what are you doing here? Is it what do you mean? I said you got no money?
01:18:00.72 --> 01:18:02.88 And he says yeah, no you told me to come and fill the seats
01:18:03.28 --> 01:18:04.88 He's putting on a show
01:18:04.88 --> 01:18:06.88 That's why I'm here and I
01:18:07.28 --> 01:18:09.28 I whispered to him I said
01:18:09.28 --> 01:18:11.28 Well, who's who's the dude with the money?
01:18:11.28 --> 01:18:14.32 Are there anyone here? We just look in at each other? Is he practicing?
01:18:14.32 --> 01:18:15.92 It's supposed to be some guy be a math
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:20.000 You know what? So he looks across the table and there's a guy there
01:18:20.80 --> 01:18:25.44 Got him Jesse Waltz and and he was the guy one of the guys I had real money and then in the room
01:18:26.56 --> 01:18:30.72 And so we listened to the pitch whatever but the tax guys is also his tax guy
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:34.40 And he says the Jesse hey you a man need to have dinner tonight so we have dinner
01:18:35.84 --> 01:18:40.72 And Jesse owned a couple companies one company was a software company and we're having dinner
01:18:40.72 --> 01:18:42.56 And he's telling me about the software business
01:18:42.56 --> 01:18:47.20 It's like a CRM or ERP combo for this industry
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.52 That's around
01:18:49.52 --> 01:18:50.80 Foundation repair
01:18:51.20 --> 01:18:56.08 Waterproofing cross-spacing cap salation. I like to refer to it as water management displacement
01:18:57.60 --> 01:19:00.32 Consumers don't know what that means but in the investment world that's what we call it
01:19:01.44 --> 01:19:04.40 And he's talking about the software business, right and I'm I'm learning
01:19:04.40 --> 01:19:10.72 I got to get out of here. This is this is ridiculous and no offense the Virginia Beach is not the hub for software development
01:19:10.72 --> 01:19:12.72 What's so funny I got
01:19:14.80 --> 01:19:19.84 So I'm thinking okay this this can't be world-class company, but as we as he continues to talk
01:19:20.48 --> 01:19:26.08 He discloses that the aggregate revenue running through his software was over 800 million dollars
01:19:27.44 --> 01:19:29.44 I think oh
01:19:29.28 --> 01:19:33.52 Not his business, but the businesses that we're using his I said oh, I mean I better pay attention
01:19:34.56 --> 01:19:37.28 So as I sit there and listen to learn more about the industry
01:19:37.28 --> 01:19:46.24 I literally had this crazy idea so I go home that night and literally get on the internet and start searching to kind of size the industry because my mind was like okay
01:19:46.24 --> 01:19:48.24 He's doing 800 million
01:19:48.24 --> 01:19:50.56 Again, no offense anyone ever junior beach and software
01:19:50.64 --> 01:19:54.72 But I didn't think he could have 50% of the market 20% of the market. I thought okay wow
01:19:54.72 --> 01:19:56.56 He probably didn't have 10% of the market
01:19:56.80 --> 01:20:02.88 But this industry has kind of been forgotten and there's no industry association for this specific industry
01:20:02.88 --> 01:20:08.96 So mostly you have an association windows roofing you can size the size of the category we couldn't do that here
01:20:10.16 --> 01:20:14.16 So my idea was was simply this look I pitched him and I put the
01:20:14.24 --> 01:20:16.64 Pupples of together that night and I
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:19.84 I remember my wife Sarah's like a year just a
01:20:20.40 --> 01:20:22.08 Crazy man
01:20:22.08 --> 01:20:28.16 So I put just Pupples of together Chaco and he was simply this I'll buy your software business. I'm sorry. I'll buy your service business
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:31.76 He owned a service business as well called J. Yes. I'll buy that service business
01:20:31.76 --> 01:20:37.68 You can capitalize your software business with the proceeds of the service business that I was kind of bought
01:20:37.76 --> 01:20:43.60 So he invented the software business to support his foundation business and I said look I ain't gonna buy that software business
01:20:43.60 --> 01:20:45.60 But I'll buy the service business
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.48 You do your own thing not your stuff out so like at 430 in the morning about the send this thing of course
01:20:50.48 --> 01:20:52.96 Sarah says hey, you idiot don't don't do that
01:20:53.44 --> 01:20:57.60 She says that a lot so I wait till like 7.30 truthfully send this thing out and
01:20:57.60 --> 01:20:59.60 And
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000 And the rest is his service of Jesse
01:21:02.48 --> 01:21:08.000 We agreed the terms like kind of three or four months after that and I bought this company called JES Foundation
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.72 Parangaging a Beach and they had at that time they had three offices a one in Monacis, which is effectively Washington DC
01:21:13.72 --> 01:21:18.40 One enrichment one Virginia Beach and he had owned another business that can't really
01:21:18.40 --> 01:21:24.08 I think he bought right before I bought him to get some R on the on the on the trade in Indiana called Indiana Foundation
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:26.08 So we started with these four
01:21:26.08 --> 01:21:28.08 locations and
01:21:28.48 --> 01:21:32.08 Aggregate revenue roughly 30 million dollars about a hundred and ninety employees
01:21:33.20 --> 01:21:35.20 um
01:21:35.20 --> 01:21:38.64 And my mind this what I wanted to do was build a national
01:21:39.44 --> 01:21:44.40 Foundation services business with this platform because I had I had seen there was no national player
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:52.000 Because there's no association. I couldn't find a national player and I'd really cut my teeth on these other businesses and kind of
01:21:52.96 --> 01:21:53.96 really
01:21:53.96 --> 01:21:57.96 felt like I was in a position to bring the leadership capital process
01:21:58.28 --> 01:22:03.16 Technology to an industry that time had forgotten and you mentioned it on the outset
01:22:03.16 --> 01:22:07.16 We are really in the construction business, but we don't talk that way. We talk consumer
01:22:07.88 --> 01:22:12.84 So day one we are consumer business. We don't talk construction. We are certainly construction company. That's what we do
01:22:12.84 --> 01:22:13.88 But we
01:22:13.88 --> 01:22:15.88 We go to market as a consumer business
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.68 In the way frankly the consumer has evolved over the last ten years if you don't go to business like that you're gonna lose and
01:22:22.68 --> 01:22:24.68 We win a lot of the
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:27.88 The business because think about your experience with contractors today
01:22:28.52 --> 01:22:33.64 It's typically horrible you know, they say they show up. They don't show up. They say you know
01:22:33.64 --> 01:22:37.96 They're gonna send you a bill. They don't so it's it's not a great process for consumers
01:22:39.08 --> 01:22:45.56 Our notion was simply we're going to build a company that puts a puts a consumer first that builds a national business
01:22:46.12 --> 01:22:48.12 But at the same time
01:22:48.12 --> 01:22:50.12 Build a unique
01:22:50.12 --> 01:22:56.84 Skill trades business that honors a men and women of this industry will they can have a profession and not a job
01:22:57.80 --> 01:23:03.56 And I learned that mindset through petrochem and shipyard staffing and it it's become kind of a
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:08.04 Not kind of it has become an obsession in mind to build businesses where
01:23:09.08 --> 01:23:11.08 We celebrate men and women that
01:23:11.80 --> 01:23:13.80 You know get it done
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:18.28 Not just with their mind with their hands because without them discontri fall support
01:23:18.28 --> 01:23:20.28 So
01:23:20.28 --> 01:23:22.28 That was how ground works was born and
01:23:23.32 --> 01:23:29.000 So that was in that was in May of 2016 we bought our but this first company and
01:23:30.28 --> 01:23:36.76 You know, I think I when I met you I'm sorry, of course. I this you might forget this but so I of course
01:23:37.32 --> 01:23:39.32 Reddictory ownership early on
01:23:40.20 --> 01:23:41.72 And
01:23:41.72 --> 01:23:45.40 Probably late 16. I think the book came out 15 but late 16. I read the book
01:23:45.40 --> 01:23:48.60 And it really resonated with me
01:23:50.28 --> 01:23:56.20 Especially as ever late at two ground works and the sense that think about what we do so we we are decentralized business
01:23:56.84 --> 01:23:59.80 our crews are three man crews if we can get them
01:24:02.28 --> 01:24:06.12 Trained on the laws of combat as as you define them we you know
01:24:07.16 --> 01:24:12.52 And as we live them you can empower a business to do remarkable things right and
01:24:12.52 --> 01:24:17.48 So we adopted this mindset of extreme ownership within the company and
01:24:18.52 --> 01:24:23.16 I never forget so what the early on it was it was pretty I had some struggles
01:24:23.16 --> 01:24:25.80 So I bought a company I had to fix up a little bit to be fair and
01:24:26.84 --> 01:24:30.84 So I went to the mustard and DC mustard of three or
01:24:31.72 --> 01:24:34.20 year was that I think was 18 okay and
01:24:36.76 --> 01:24:38.28 So I
01:24:38.28 --> 01:24:43.16 Didn't share this but look every penny I had when in this company I literally moved back in but mom
01:24:44.44 --> 01:24:48.60 To buy this company with a wife and a child so
01:24:49.32 --> 01:24:51.32 Yeah, so that was a lean of course. Miss
01:24:52.20 --> 01:24:54.20 Back to the Christmas
01:24:55.08 --> 01:24:58.92 And that's why your wife was like don't send that freaking email
01:25:01.32 --> 01:25:03.32 That's our money that's right
01:25:03.32 --> 01:25:10.20 So to make a run at this and put everything in and and you know you I hear you talk quite a bit
01:25:10.20 --> 01:25:13.96 But to be successful and anything there has to be a degree of obsession
01:25:14.60 --> 01:25:20.92 There's no plan B for us here. It is this is it there's we're all in on this and it there's that has to work
01:25:21.24 --> 01:25:25.32 And it will work because I'll put everything we have into to making it work and so
01:25:26.44 --> 01:25:31.96 We're cleaning up a few things that we needed to we spent probably over a million dollars of of going back and doing jobs
01:25:31.96 --> 01:25:33.96 We're consumers to do them correctly and
01:25:35.40 --> 01:25:39.72 So the price tag for the musters. It's it's it's real and so
01:25:40.60 --> 01:25:42.92 I was gonna bring some of my leaders and
01:25:43.72 --> 01:25:50.52 I have a partner so this fellow Jesse Walts invested back into the business with me and he's a minority shareholder at the time and and
01:25:51.88 --> 01:25:55.08 You know as I can't run this through the company because you know
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:58.36 He's not really happy with me at the moment anyway even though I'm an already guy
01:25:58.36 --> 01:26:04.52 I want to keep him happy and respect him so I tell the wife. Hey guess what uh is it okay if I spend X amount of dollars
01:26:04.52 --> 01:26:08.28 You go this muster. I'm gonna bring these guys and you can imagine the look
01:26:08.84 --> 01:26:13.96 You like what what are you doing right so go to the muster. I bring a guys
01:26:14.60 --> 01:26:19.32 One guys one my best friends a guy named Tom Gerard who doesn't work for me, but is a huge fan of yours
01:26:19.96 --> 01:26:23.48 And he's like like you gotta go these musters. I'm like probably you ever been to our muster?
01:26:23.48 --> 01:26:29.56 So no and by the way he played football Harvard so he's he's a bond trader. He ain't worried about living with mama
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:32.84 But he's like my long I'll pay my own way. I said you should pay my way
01:26:33.48 --> 01:26:37.40 So we go we go to we go to the muster and and and candidly
01:26:38.12 --> 01:26:40.84 It and I say this internally with my guy
01:26:40.84 --> 01:26:43.80 So it's like man, this is gonna either be like some Tony Robbins bullshit
01:26:43.80 --> 01:26:48.92 We're gonna hug it out and sing a kumbaya on and be a waste of money or it's gonna be the real deal and it was the real deal
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.36 It was literally the real deal and I said I gotta get me some of this
01:26:52.36 --> 01:26:55.56 I gotta figure out a way to weave the mindset and
01:26:56.36 --> 01:26:59.32 the cadence of what we talked about and all of the laws
01:27:00.12 --> 01:27:05.88 Into our business to empower this business to be as special as I want it to be if you're gonna make investments in people
01:27:07.08 --> 01:27:11.48 And you're gonna you're gonna build a business where the profession is honored
01:27:13.08 --> 01:27:19.96 You have to give them the tools in order to do it you just can't you know for example joc we can teach sales we can teach production
01:27:19.96 --> 01:27:23.32 But how do you teach leadership?
01:27:23.96 --> 01:27:28.76 How do you really teach it and how do you measure it's effect and what's the return on investment on that?
01:27:30.60 --> 01:27:32.12 And that was look
01:27:32.12 --> 01:27:33.96 The way you did it and
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:37.64 Laved it at seal teams and how you wrote about it I said well
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:43.08 There's no one on the planet that can do I mean if he can't do it for us it can't be done right so
01:27:43.48 --> 01:27:46.28 I'm driving back from DC and I'm all jacked up
01:27:46.28 --> 01:27:51.64 And I call I don't know about that back in the day you your headquarters were in Seattle
01:27:52.20 --> 01:27:54.20 So we call out to Seattle and
01:27:55.24 --> 01:28:01.08 And I get a young guy on the phone and he's like listen we don't really really do long-term programs
01:28:01.08 --> 01:28:05.40 If we're effective at what we do we don't really need to be there because I pitched him on hey look
01:28:05.40 --> 01:28:07.40 I want to multi-year deal
01:28:07.40 --> 01:28:13.64 So I can I can send new leaders through this program constantly so that I can transform my business so that
01:28:13.64 --> 01:28:20.04 We have a bunch of savages walking around that care about the customer care about themselves and are passionate about leadership and development
01:28:21.08 --> 01:28:23.08 and
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:26.04 So he said no initially and then so we call back
01:28:26.12 --> 01:28:29.56 Say look I don't think I've explained myself right where the who's kind of what we're looking for and
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:37.40 Yeah, that interesting little backstory and that that's sort of is the you know failure on my part because one of the things that I would tell
01:28:37.56 --> 01:28:39.96 The team at Ashland front is I'd say listen
01:28:39.96 --> 01:28:44.52 I don't want to be like these consulting companies that go in and hang on put their hooks and and
01:28:44.52 --> 01:28:49.000 Cloy is in and they they're just gonna milk company for everything that they're worth listen guys
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.44 If we're doing our job correctly, we're not there for five years
01:28:52.44 --> 01:28:56.52 We're there for six months. We're there for a year they understand these principles and they take them and run with them
01:28:57.24 --> 01:28:59.24 What I didn't clarify
01:28:59.24 --> 01:29:01.80 is hey if we've got a company that's growing rapidly
01:29:02.44 --> 01:29:08.36 We may need to help them along the way and and that happened with other companies in your companies one of the ones that had happened to
01:29:08.36 --> 01:29:12.84 Was happening to very fast and so I had to kind of I mean I forget how it got back to me
01:29:12.84 --> 01:29:18.76 But I remember rebrieving the team and saying listen if we have a client that's growing rapidly
01:29:19.48 --> 01:29:23.56 We can train all their trainers, but they're still gonna need people. They're just gonna need support
01:29:23.56 --> 01:29:28.76 I mean you when you when you're absorbing two or three companies a year that have two or three hundred people each
01:29:29.88 --> 01:29:34.20 You're probably gonna need help. Yeah, we need to help them. So there's a little backstory there
01:29:34.20 --> 01:29:40.12 Yeah, well, they certainly echoed your first sentiments right away. They said no no wait and it makes sense
01:29:40.12 --> 01:29:43.40 But we had to really explain look it's not the same people going to the program
01:29:44.36 --> 01:29:48.04 And you know, can't like that time we didn't have the ban what to have true trainers
01:29:48.20 --> 01:29:52.92 We were so okay. We're gonna hire the firm. We're gonna send new leaders new new leaders to the process and
01:29:53.40 --> 01:29:58.92 Look our growth rate. We are acquiring businesses and we wanted to make sure that those businesses
01:30:00.04 --> 01:30:02.04 They keep their culture. We celebrate that culture
01:30:02.04 --> 01:30:07.08 You know our average brand at ground works is over 26 years old other companies. We buy
01:30:07.64 --> 01:30:10.92 We buy businesses as small as three man as large as 80
01:30:11.88 --> 01:30:15.08 So they're big dichotomy in terms of the size of the businesses
01:30:17.16 --> 01:30:22.92 And when we buy then we we celebrate their culture, but we're gonna bring them on to the ground works way of culture
01:30:22.92 --> 01:30:30.36 Which you can marry those two hundred percent and the way we married them was by leveraging extreme ownership as our culture
01:30:30.36 --> 01:30:32.36 And
01:30:32.52 --> 01:30:42.20 So it empowers a given culture if they embrace these things and they do and so every acquisition now we run an FTX for the the
01:30:42.28 --> 01:30:43.88 partners that we we've just brought on
01:30:44.68 --> 01:30:46.68 I think we've run 16 of those now
01:30:47.40 --> 01:30:51.000 all kind of senior level leadership go to monsters
01:30:51.40 --> 01:30:55.64 You know, we're gonna send 23 folks Dallas it's part of our
01:30:56.76 --> 01:30:59.80 Leadership development training program at ground works and you know
01:30:59.80 --> 01:31:01.80 we have
01:31:01.80 --> 01:31:09.96 I think the last number we spent we've sent five hundred thirty folks through training directly with the echelon front team you know
01:31:09.96 --> 01:31:11.96 JP D'Nell
01:31:11.96 --> 01:31:13.96 Carlos
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:15.16 Corey
01:31:15.16 --> 01:31:20.20 Cody rather and then this this young guy flanned caucran back in the day
01:31:20.52 --> 01:31:23.88 You know they would lead that process for us and and really
01:31:25.08 --> 01:31:28.28 Again, not to sound like a promotion what they became part of the team like
01:31:28.28 --> 01:31:30.28 JP knows my team and
01:31:31.48 --> 01:31:37.24 He can relate the stories of our business and the construction component of our business and a way that
01:31:37.72 --> 01:31:42.36 Ties it into extreme ownership and how it applies to our business every day and
01:31:42.84 --> 01:31:46.28 That is how you really learn and that that's how it's absorbed and so
01:31:47.08 --> 01:31:49.08 Your team's done a really good job at that for us
01:31:49.64 --> 01:31:51.64 Yeah, that the
01:31:51.64 --> 01:31:56.76 You know when you talk about merging hey this idea this these principles into some other company and
01:31:56.76 --> 01:32:03.16 And sometimes I'll get out people will have discussions with leaders about that and you know that's why I don't know if it's gonna
01:32:03.16 --> 01:32:07.96 I don't know if you know our culture is gonna match and I always say I have like a
01:32:08.52 --> 01:32:10.52 I've answered this question so many times
01:32:10.52 --> 01:32:16.44 That I kind of just go oh you don't think the culture's gonna match you you maybe think you have some different leadership principles
01:32:16.44 --> 01:32:21.40 That you follow you. Yeah, you know we're just we're not the military we weren't the military so we're just you know
01:32:21.40 --> 01:32:23.80 We don't have that mindset and I said whoa, you know
01:32:23.80 --> 01:32:28.28 Let's talk about it a little bit, you know for instance we teach cover move which is teamwork which is supporting team
01:32:28.28 --> 01:32:31.80 Our you teach in that you should all stay in silos and work against each other
01:32:32.04 --> 01:32:36.20 We teach about keeping things simple our are you teaching that we should make things so complex
01:32:36.20 --> 01:32:39.16 That no one knows what's going on. We talk about prioritize next cue
01:32:39.48 --> 01:32:42.20 Do you think that in your company what you'd rather do is
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.88 Spread yourself so thin over so many different things at the same time that you can't effectively do anything
01:32:47.88 --> 01:32:53.48 It is that what you're thinking and decentralized commander are you are you thinking that you don't want to empower your
01:32:53.48 --> 01:32:59.16 Subordinate leaders you want all decisions to be run through some central location and even the idea of extreme ownership
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:06.60 Are what you think and is this doesn't match with your culture because your culture is we're gonna all sit around and blame each other and point fingers each other
01:33:06.84 --> 01:33:08.84 so like
01:33:08.84 --> 01:33:09.96 There's no
01:33:09.96 --> 01:33:14.52 Leadership human in the world that disagrees with these principles
01:33:14.92 --> 01:33:21.32 You just can't they're they're they're universal principles that are foundational to leading other human beings
01:33:21.32 --> 01:33:27.80 So the fact that you've that you recognize that that you saw oh I see this and then
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:33.16 The step that you're talking about that that JPE and and the rest of the team the JPE does well
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:37.000 But he's when work with you for a long time we do this all the time we do it finance companies
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.12 We do with manufacturing companies like the principles apply
01:33:40.84 --> 01:33:48.20 To any organization the thing that's nice is that you were able to sit there at that master and go oh I see the alignment between
01:33:48.20 --> 01:33:51.72 Oh decentralized command well late to see I got a bunch of disaggregated people
01:33:51.72 --> 01:33:53.48 I got small elements that are going out in the field
01:33:53.72 --> 01:33:57.88 They've got to understand how they're gonna interact with the customer that's how we're gonna get good feedback
01:33:57.88 --> 01:34:02.44 That's how we're gonna grow our business. Oh, okay, that makes sense. Oh, what about prioritize next here?
01:34:02.44 --> 01:34:07.24 Oh, yeah, well, we've got all these things that are gonna go wrong on a job site if we don't have people that
01:34:07.24 --> 01:34:13.56 Understand if we don't have people that understand how to react to those things and how to figure out what the most important thing is an execute on that
01:34:14.36 --> 01:34:16.04 And you just were able to
01:34:16.04 --> 01:34:20.92 See that and and therefore take any go hey, we need to run with that and that's
01:34:21.56 --> 01:34:25.000 That's an impressive call to make. Oh, thank you. Okay
01:34:26.04 --> 01:34:31.000 And retrospect it looks like genius, right, but but can't really at the time it was
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:38.92 Back to that simple equation how do you build leaders right? I've truly believe that that and you've said this main movement a thousand times or more
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:41.24 That you can teach leadership
01:34:41.24 --> 01:34:49.16 You can teach it and you should teach it and you should learn to be a student of leadership, right? And so look you've got so many war heroes on this podcast
01:34:49.40 --> 01:34:53.16 I'm the opposite of that. I'm just a normal knuckle dragger, you know entrepreneur
01:34:54.04 --> 01:34:56.52 But you don't have to be in the military to embrace these principles
01:34:56.84 --> 01:34:59.48 If you if you if you lead anything in your life
01:34:59.96 --> 01:35:05.80 These principles apply and I'm again just the walking example of that and my company is as well and so
01:35:07.32 --> 01:35:09.32 What you've seen at ground works is
01:35:09.32 --> 01:35:11.32 is the belief that
01:35:12.44 --> 01:35:15.40 If you at unite people on a mission and
01:35:16.28 --> 01:35:18.28 You empower them and
01:35:18.92 --> 01:35:20.92 Train them and believe in them
01:35:21.72 --> 01:35:23.72 You can do the impossible
01:35:23.88 --> 01:35:31.48 You know part of part of the notion of ground works and we've taken extreme ownership a little deeper than just the laws of combat
01:35:33.56 --> 01:35:38.28 At our company we have ever 235 owners so think about the decentralized business, right?
01:35:38.28 --> 01:35:42.04 So today the business again north of 800 million we have
01:35:42.52 --> 01:35:44.52 49 locations
01:35:44.52 --> 01:35:49.40 At each one of those locations as a general manager a sales manager a production manager an office manager
01:35:51.24 --> 01:35:55.64 My manager of philosophy before even reading the book pretty simple
01:35:56.04 --> 01:36:00.60 When I hear the best possible person like a possibly higher and afford that does change over time
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.96 But you want to do that you want to give them the best equipment you can afford to as a business training
01:36:05.96 --> 01:36:09.08 equipment whatever might need you want to
01:36:09.72 --> 01:36:14.28 Build and center programs that allow them as an individual to win when the company wins
01:36:15.48 --> 01:36:17.48 And then you want to hold them accountable
01:36:17.80 --> 01:36:21.80 So if you believe in that concept again that that's pretty simple management philosophy
01:36:21.80 --> 01:36:28.20 People even that concept and you super layer in the principle of the stream ownership and then you say one step further
01:36:29.16 --> 01:36:31.16 All you leaders in the branches
01:36:31.72 --> 01:36:33.96 You're going to be literally owners of our business
01:36:33.96 --> 01:36:35.96 So I don't want you just to
01:36:37.08 --> 01:36:43.80 Adopt extreme ownership live that way if you do that and you really believe it and we as a company win
01:36:44.60 --> 01:36:49.24 You and your family will get the benefit of that by ownership and so look at ground works
01:36:49.24 --> 01:36:54.28 We're going to make over a hundred millionaires out of this company for men and women that work with their hands
01:36:56.44 --> 01:37:01.64 Think about how many companies out there in the valley and and solve work companies startups you have all these young
01:37:01.64 --> 01:37:06.28 And they've earned it, but all these young overnight miners walking around
01:37:08.68 --> 01:37:14.12 I always felt like you can bring that same mindset to a skilled trades business
01:37:14.92 --> 01:37:18.60 You could and we're going to prove that it can be done and by doing that
01:37:18.60 --> 01:37:23.24 I'm going to track world-class talent to this business if you're at another home services company today
01:37:23.64 --> 01:37:26.44 if you're at you know window company or
01:37:26.44 --> 01:37:32.60 I won't say any company names, but if you're at any any company and you want to get after it
01:37:33.32 --> 01:37:38.28 And I don't mean just believe in the philosophy of this and also what we are building as a company
01:37:38.76 --> 01:37:43.16 But if you care about working with people that care and you want to build something unique
01:37:43.64 --> 01:37:48.04 And we get rewarded for that as a business and as an individual to help your family
01:37:48.04 --> 01:37:54.68 We're the only business that I think in home services adopted that mindset and that's why we're winning like
01:37:56.44 --> 01:38:01.80 Groundwork success has nothing to do with matmalon it has to do with the 4200 people that make it up
01:38:02.52 --> 01:38:08.28 Only thing I did was kind of push and know it's shut the strategy and adopt all these different tribes
01:38:08.28 --> 01:38:12.52 Not just Eostrategy, but how we in scent we have profit sharing programs for example
01:38:12.52 --> 01:38:13.96 We have good benefits
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:18.12 You know we have a career path where many women can join here and have a profession
01:38:18.60 --> 01:38:25.64 The many of the companies that I buy man, it is a job. Here's why you buy a family owned business and Mr. Smith is at the top
01:38:25.64 --> 01:38:29.56 And Mr. Smith's kids at the business and say it's a ten-man dollar business
01:38:30.04 --> 01:38:32.04 You're the third man down
01:38:32.44 --> 01:38:36.92 How are you going to get any more money? How are you going to grow? Well, in that kind of environment you're not going to grow
01:38:36.92 --> 01:38:38.92 So family owned businesses are great. We love them
01:38:38.92 --> 01:38:43.32 But in our business, I want someone on on on our staff to take my job
01:38:44.04 --> 01:38:45.24 They should
01:38:45.24 --> 01:38:51.08 That's what we're built to do is that if we build an environment respects the men and women that get up every day and work with their hands
01:38:51.08 --> 01:38:54.04 Shaco in the mud like it we have office in North Dakota
01:38:54.68 --> 01:38:58.60 And far go these dudes are out there in 10 degrees. We got offices in Miami
01:38:58.60 --> 01:39:05.16 It's a 110 degrees out there some days these guys get out there protect consumers great to sat there asset their home
01:39:05.56 --> 01:39:07.56 It's not sexy
01:39:07.56 --> 01:39:14.52 It's hard work, but at our company we can make it profession and a livelihood that recruits a best possible town the world in home
01:39:14.52 --> 01:39:19.88 Service has to do something's never been done and it's it's a big dream but it's not me
01:39:20.12 --> 01:39:25.56 It's my team the team is building it and that's what's great about not only our company, but this country is it
01:39:26.68 --> 01:39:31.72 You can do that you can do that here still and you're not spring or you know what I'm talking about so
01:39:31.72 --> 01:39:38.68 E.o. has been a big big part of our internal mindset and culture and still is like we have
01:39:39.24 --> 01:39:41.24 Meetings they're called cover and move
01:39:41.72 --> 01:39:47.96 So when sales and production get together every week to talk about their week and the jobs that we have to do it's a little the cover and move
01:39:48.52 --> 01:39:49.80 Meeting
01:39:49.80 --> 01:39:54.84 Deep debrief and rebak that is a that those are phrases we use every day
01:39:54.84 --> 01:39:56.84 You know standard protocol
01:39:56.84 --> 01:39:58.84 It's it's but
01:39:58.84 --> 01:40:03.88 Having work in other businesses and owning other businesses the power of just a readback
01:40:05.48 --> 01:40:09.96 It's hard to explain I use it with my wife was she hates. Let me give me a readback on that
01:40:09.96 --> 01:40:15.40 What is what I heard oh your kids my Logan I I I I said okay
01:40:16.04 --> 01:40:18.04 We just discussed this
01:40:18.04 --> 01:40:19.64 Tell me what daddy just said you know so
01:40:20.68 --> 01:40:22.68 You know you live it
01:40:22.92 --> 01:40:28.76 But to you know look to two some of your listeners out there that are in the service of thinking about getting out of service one day to all the business
01:40:28.76 --> 01:40:30.76 Guys out there all the entrepreneurs
01:40:32.28 --> 01:40:33.56 Look it's real
01:40:33.56 --> 01:40:40.36 It's real if you but if you adopt it and live it is real and I have this phrase that I use all the time internally. It's
01:40:41.40 --> 01:40:43.40 You get the life you give yourself
01:40:45.48 --> 01:40:50.20 Like their externalities that have happened in your life and sometimes you can't affect them you can't do anything about them
01:40:50.20 --> 01:40:51.88 But the end of the day
01:40:51.88 --> 01:40:57.88 If you decide to get up you have the discipline to get up and get after it every day and you make it a priority
01:40:57.88 --> 01:41:06.76 You can change your course of your life and all we're doing as at groundworks is using that mindset on a business that changes 4200 lies
01:41:08.20 --> 01:41:15.000 Sounds cool now, but when when you know those slim criss-misses when you know when when I'm begging my wife to
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:20.12 To allow us to send you know eight dudes to a mustard and DC it wasn't that way
01:41:21.72 --> 01:41:27.08 The the the the the investment that you make right so this is this is the thing that's very interesting
01:41:27.08 --> 01:41:34.28 You you are investing in your leaders and you've been investing your leaders. You know what when I got back from my last appointment when I
01:41:34.68 --> 01:41:36.68 Was in Ramadi came back and
01:41:38.36 --> 01:41:41.40 Took over the West Coast training and I was just
01:41:41.88 --> 01:41:47.16 So focused Charles focused on the shooters focused on making sure that the young guys understood that as
01:41:47.80 --> 01:41:53.28 Seals they needed to be thinking shooters absolutely, but I really really was focused on the leadership and making sure that the leaders
01:41:53.44 --> 01:41:55.44 leaders understood how to lead and
01:41:55.44 --> 01:42:03.84 It was one of the things that really opened my eyes is on that deployment and really on previous my previous deployments through my whole career
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:08.72 The army and the Marine Corps had had absolutely professionalized and
01:42:09.12 --> 01:42:14.96 Dr. Eliz how they trained leaders so the the army
01:42:15.60 --> 01:42:17.60 The army would go to this the
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:22.88 Company career course the career course they call it which is a company level commander and
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:29.36 And this is like a six month or a year long school that these guys would get trained on how to lead their troops
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:34.68 And they have that at every level in listed an officer in the army and in the Marine Corps and
01:42:35.36 --> 01:42:42.16 In the seal teams there was almost nothing there was almost nothing there was a little junior officer training course
01:42:42.40 --> 01:42:43.76 That was
01:42:43.76 --> 01:42:45.68 Lafend it up taking it over when he took it over
01:42:45.68 --> 01:42:49.36 It was hey this where you're gonna learn how to write evaluations this is gonna
01:42:49.36 --> 01:42:54.08 You're gonna learn a little bit about writing navy met navy message traffic it was
01:42:54.64 --> 01:42:58.48 And you'd get some debriefs on this stuff, but you weren't going to actually learn
01:42:59.20 --> 01:43:03.60 Any principles of leadership and it was just it was unbelievable
01:43:04.16 --> 01:43:08.24 That this was taking place and I remember as I started to try and push this hard
01:43:09.12 --> 01:43:13.92 The I went I started going up my chain of command and one of the things that I'd bring up the chain of command was was
01:43:14.32 --> 01:43:16.32 Hamburger University and
01:43:16.88 --> 01:43:18.40 Hamburger University if you don't know
01:43:18.40 --> 01:43:20.40 It's up in
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:31.04 I think it's in Shomburg Illinois, but if you're gonna run in McDonald's you've got to go to this this course and it's like a six month school that you go to
01:43:31.76 --> 01:43:36.88 And so I remember sitting down with my boss and saying hey you have you heard in hamburger universities and what's that?
01:43:36.88 --> 01:43:39.36 I said it's if you're gonna run a freaking McDonald's
01:43:40.08 --> 01:43:44.80 You're gonna go to a six month training course on how to lead a McDonald's where you flip burgers and
01:43:44.80 --> 01:43:52.72 And fry front fries and we've got guys that have are gonna go out and and oversee combat operations and have lives at risk
01:43:52.72 --> 01:43:54.96 And we give them they don't go to any school
01:43:55.60 --> 01:43:59.20 This is a problem and and and part of the problem is because
01:44:00.48 --> 01:44:02.88 We're a victim of our own success so hey, you know
01:44:03.44 --> 01:44:07.44 Hey, Jocco you just went on deployment you came back you did a good job you weren't charged. Okay, so what we're doing is working
01:44:08.40 --> 01:44:13.36 And hey this other guy, you know, Laefa you did good you got mentored and you got trained up
01:44:13.36 --> 01:44:18.32 So that what we're doing on the job training works and it does work sometimes
01:44:18.96 --> 01:44:22.96 But it but it also fails sometimes and this is so now we find this in every industry
01:44:23.28 --> 01:44:28.72 Every industry hey, oh we we got we got echo Charles here. He's a good salesman
01:44:29.12 --> 01:44:32.24 In fact, he's our best salesman. Let's put him in charge of sales
01:44:32.96 --> 01:44:38.48 What does he know about leadership? He knows how to sell stuff. He doesn't know anything about leading. Oh, we got echo Charles here
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:39.68 He's our best
01:44:39.68 --> 01:44:44.56 He's our best mechanic. Okay, great. What are we gonna do? Let's put him in charge of all the mechanics
01:44:44.80 --> 01:44:51.44 He's good at turn and rent. She's not good at leadership and we just throw him in there and for some reason
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:56.80 People think that leadership is something you're just born with or that you know how to do an
01:44:57.36 --> 01:45:03.52 Intuitively and it's just factually not true. So what we encourage and what you're actually doing is oh echo
01:45:04.16 --> 01:45:05.84 You're the best mechanic
01:45:05.84 --> 01:45:12.32 We're gonna take you and we're gonna elevate you into a leadership position and we're gonna train you how to lead just like at one point
01:45:12.32 --> 01:45:19.12 We trained you on how to turn rentches and repair this carburetor. We're we're gonna we're gonna train you the same way
01:45:19.68 --> 01:45:24.08 And you've put a massive amount of investment into your leadership and
01:45:25.36 --> 01:45:29.76 One of the earlier questions, you know when we started echelon front, you know, I get asked well how are we gonna?
01:45:30.64 --> 01:45:35.52 How are we gonna know if this works? What are the metrics and know if the succeeds and I still to this day
01:45:35.52 --> 01:45:37.52 I just had this conversation the other day
01:45:38.24 --> 01:45:42.16 Whatever metric you're running at your company that means you you are successful
01:45:42.16 --> 01:45:48.88 So whether you're trying to cut the cost to produce or you're trying to improve your time to produce or you're trying to grow or whatever metric
01:45:48.88 --> 01:45:55.44 You're looking at if we do our job training your leaders that metric all those metrics that you're trying to prove on
01:45:55.44 --> 01:46:00.24 They are all going to improve that's what's going to happen and and that's where you say hey
01:46:00.24 --> 01:46:06.80 Look we actually have we do some of these like you know soft skill surveys now and you know what do you think your leadership?
01:46:06.80 --> 01:46:10.08 And that's good too. That's good feedback. It's good feedback to say hey
01:46:10.40 --> 01:46:18.80 The leadership is now has a better relationship with the troops. That's great. The troops think the leadership is more in tune with what they're thinking and what they're saying
01:46:18.80 --> 01:46:20.80 Those are those are great things to do as well
01:46:21.36 --> 01:46:22.16 But
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:25.52 For me where the money for the rubber meets the road is hey
01:46:25.52 --> 01:46:30.40 We're trying to produce this widget in this amount of time and now we're doing it. We're cutting our costs
01:46:30.48 --> 01:46:32.88 We're getting it out ourselves people are doing better
01:46:33.20 --> 01:46:37.36 That's how we measure leadership success is what is the success of the company?
01:46:37.36 --> 01:46:41.52 So as you you invest you get that ROI and
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:47.52 That's what I you know that's what I I love about seeing the success of your company and some of the other companies that we work with that
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.56 We get to see this this incredible growth and
01:46:51.04 --> 01:46:55.44 You know I started this whole thing off saying leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield in business and
01:46:55.44 --> 01:46:58.48 Life and to look at a company like yours where you are proving
01:46:59.12 --> 01:47:05.68 How that works and how important it is and how you can grow things and how you can have
01:47:06.56 --> 01:47:12.24 4200 employees and I'd love to you know if you are fishing for a compliment say no
01:47:12.24 --> 01:47:17.12 But mad at all starts with you. Hey, it does I'll give you a compliment. It does start with you
01:47:17.36 --> 01:47:18.88 But let's face it
01:47:19.12 --> 01:47:23.52 You've got employees that haven't seen you in three months
01:47:23.52 --> 01:47:27.60 You've got you've got someone right now making a decision in a basement
01:47:28.08 --> 01:47:36.32 100% on on something that's happening and and that individual is making the right decision as a leader on the front lines
01:47:36.32 --> 01:47:38.32 He's empowered to do that and you
01:47:39.20 --> 01:47:44.000 You couldn't see that if your life dependent on it you couldn't help that person make that decision
01:47:45.04 --> 01:47:48.80 Except for the fact that you already have helped them because you trained him as a leader
01:47:48.80 --> 01:47:54.64 They understand the culture they understand the mission of the company and when you do that it allows you to
01:47:55.04 --> 01:47:59.12 To drive a company forward with people at every level
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:04.88 Leading making the right decisions and moving in the same direction strategically. It's the only way to scale
01:48:05.28 --> 01:48:09.52 Right, so you you just gave that great example you have a we have forming right now
01:48:09.52 --> 01:48:13.44 It's a forming right now probably anywhere in the country, right? So say it's in Kansas City and
01:48:13.68 --> 01:48:17.52 The footers not where you need to be and he's laying down when he needs to lay down he's second
01:48:17.52 --> 01:48:24.32 Wow shit what I got to do here he's been empowered. He knows the number one objective take care of the customer
01:48:24.56 --> 01:48:31.52 If it costs a few dollars more no factor if it costs a couple hundred dollars more no factor if it costs like a thousand dollars
01:48:31.52 --> 01:48:36.56 I'm gonna fire call my soup to make sure it's cool, but that soup's gonna know no factor go serve the customer
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:44.40 Okay, but that mindset is is is is is part of our culture and that comes from the investment that you make in a business
01:48:44.40 --> 01:48:51.12 We see it all the time when we buy businesses, you know this this this this old and I call it lazy
01:48:51.44 --> 01:48:54.08 The notion of all in the job training is lazy
01:48:54.88 --> 01:48:58.16 It's lazy if you if you say to yourself
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:00.64 I want to be world class. I want to be good
01:49:00.64 --> 01:49:05.36 You don't stick just a guy with a guy and say go learn from jaco because he's really good at this
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:09.68 That's lazy small businesses do that that don't want to grow
01:49:09.68 --> 01:49:15.60 If you if you want to get institutional approach to changing an industry and being the best possible business
01:49:15.60 --> 01:49:22.32 You can possibly be it has to be part of who you are and that takes time investment and energy and our
01:49:22.32 --> 01:49:24.96 KPIs at groundwork. They've exploded over the last
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000 four years five years
01:49:28.24 --> 01:49:31.44 A lot of factors one key factor one key factor
01:49:31.44 --> 01:49:38.96 Is investing in leadership training you can't be a leader in our company unless you go through it every employee gets a book
01:49:39.44 --> 01:49:44.08 I mean, it's it you can't get away from it now. Do they read it? I don't know
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:49.68 But you can't be a leader and a manager. I'm sorry. You can't be a manager. You can be a leader without being a manager
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.20 You can't be a manager at groundwork without going through a course
01:49:54.08 --> 01:49:56.08 And that's just who we are now
01:49:56.08 --> 01:50:02.48 As you know human beings are human beings and some people take it better than others but on average I think our culture is such that
01:50:03.12 --> 01:50:05.36 If you don't live that way you're kind of weed it out
01:50:06.08 --> 01:50:10.72 Because there's a complete alignment on what we are doing as a business
01:50:10.72 --> 01:50:14.72 Not just our mission of building a great world-class home services company
01:50:15.44 --> 01:50:18.16 But there's a culture internally of we're gonna do it the right way
01:50:18.56 --> 01:50:20.96 We're gonna care about the men and women that work here
01:50:21.52 --> 01:50:24.64 We call it walking in the light and living with the servants heart
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:26.64 And yes, we serve the customer
01:50:26.96 --> 01:50:34.64 But my leaders we serve each other and if the the overall goal is to build a great business where we all win
01:50:35.52 --> 01:50:39.44 And what we're literally making may-in-airs out of men and women that never have gone to college
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:43.76 We are serving one another
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:49.52 Yeah, and that's that's the powerful thing. I got to share this one pit with you so fast for
01:50:50.96 --> 01:50:52.96 I'm running out of money
01:50:52.96 --> 01:50:54.96 So this was in 19
01:50:57.04 --> 01:51:00.32 Serenite you know, we put everything we had in this business. I sold
01:51:01.12 --> 01:51:05.92 So I sold Petro Cam that company I first started with to put back into groundwork
01:51:05.92 --> 01:51:08.96 So I sold it to a big time private equity for a mountain San Francisco
01:51:10.24 --> 01:51:14.56 Huge return for me and the misses. I can't say it publicly, but it's
01:51:15.68 --> 01:51:18.32 Way north of five times over 20
01:51:18.32 --> 01:51:20.32 Oh
01:51:21.20 --> 01:51:28.000 Shipyard staffing have a great partner that his name is Jack Anthony that I partnered up with the run that business from a heat
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.76 He absolutely crushed it for us
01:51:30.48 --> 01:51:34.000 sold that to all of all funds the founders fund
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:41.04 The most legitimate vase VC farm in the world probably Peter Thiel and his team and and all the great investments
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:43.68 Some knuckle drag a promotion view
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:49.84 sold his company to Peter Thiel the guy that you know space X and pay for all those things, right?
01:51:50.08 --> 01:51:52.64 He started a company called work rise
01:51:53.20 --> 01:51:59.12 They are in the oligas industry they bought our little platform to enter the marine industry into defense industry
01:51:59.12 --> 01:52:01.44 Like it's surreal only in America, right?
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:06.96 So we took every penny that we had from those things pot of right pick and the groundworks, but still wasn't enough
01:52:07.92 --> 01:52:09.92 So in 19
01:52:09.92 --> 01:52:17.36 You know we decided now I had outside investors I had some friends and family, you know like folks that that I've seen and and been friends with
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:19.76 No institutional no big money guys
01:52:21.60 --> 01:52:28.16 We wanted to continue this mission and I had worked for four or five years developing relationships of companies to buy some big ones and so I
01:52:28.32 --> 01:52:32.16 Finally had to bite the bullet and and bring on a financial partner so
01:52:32.16 --> 01:52:39.12 We are fortunate enough. I have a really good friend that is a great investment banker John Nunes or forehome services and
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:44.08 I literally saw him on a sunrise service on Easter you love this so
01:52:45.76 --> 01:52:49.60 He don't live in VB, but you know I have this little guy Logan and you know
01:52:49.92 --> 01:52:53.92 We can't take him to church on Easter Sunday because he's mad man Hilbert on around
01:52:54.48 --> 01:52:58.64 So sirs like hey, let's go this sunrise service. We'll just run off and serve for whatever he does
01:52:58.64 --> 01:53:02.56 We're still got to be able to go to church right so he's running around and where at this sunrise service
01:53:02.56 --> 01:53:06.32 And I look behind me there's just guy John nooner who hadn't seen since college by the way
01:53:06.72 --> 01:53:11.44 I was his RA one of the other jobs I hadn't college. I was an RA. It's terrible don't judge
01:53:12.64 --> 01:53:16.64 Not good gig, but there this is guy John nooner. He said hey, I'm gonna fall in your company
01:53:16.64 --> 01:53:23.44 So this was in this was April of 19 and I say this is a great timing because we need a we need a financial partner
01:53:23.44 --> 01:53:26.96 So we talked about 13 private equity from some of the greatest brands in the world
01:53:26.96 --> 01:53:35.92 13 offers which again, that's surreal right you build a company and you know the names of all these firms
01:53:35.92 --> 01:53:37.92 Right, so it's kind of well it's pretty exciting
01:53:38.48 --> 01:53:44.16 We took it down to three and ultimately picked one we picked a group called quartet at a New York
01:53:45.84 --> 01:53:50.72 They have a guy that is our chairman of the guy named David Shnodik who is legitimate savage
01:53:50.72 --> 01:53:52.40 So he's he's more aggressive than me
01:53:52.40 --> 01:53:58.72 But they had great experience with Yeti so they built Yeti they were the private equity firm behind Yeti
01:53:59.28 --> 01:54:04.32 You know, they took that thing from whatever 40 million to billion and it's public now and but they're really good at marketing
01:54:05.44 --> 01:54:10.000 And I wanted to transform my business into consumer marketing company. Yes, we do construction
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.16 Yes, I have the the horsepower behind the scenes or men and women that dual with that their hands
01:54:14.72 --> 01:54:18.80 But how we went in the marketplace with consumers is being differentiated so that when
01:54:18.80 --> 01:54:22.000 Like it's the Amazon approach when I'm coming to your house
01:54:22.40 --> 01:54:27.28 You see you're going to get a text it's going to show where my car is is going to say hey this guy's going to show up here
01:54:27.28 --> 01:54:33.76 What he looks like so he went to leverage technology and and really leverage how we attack the consumer side of our business
01:54:34.24 --> 01:54:39.92 And I thought they were good at that and so we partnered up with them and then you know COVID hit right so imagine
01:54:40.56 --> 01:54:41.92 Big investment
01:54:42.16 --> 01:54:43.52 COVID
01:54:43.52 --> 01:54:45.12 Everyone is scared at this time right
01:54:45.12 --> 01:54:49.52 Thankfully at groundworks we were we were we were a
01:54:50.16 --> 01:54:54.72 Essential business which I love so we have these these shirts that we gave out called the essentials
01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.24 But I remember how to get lawyers to give letters to every driver so as we went down the road
01:55:00.64 --> 01:55:04.80 You know if they got stopped they could put out this letter and say look where you know we're such a so we went to work
01:55:05.84 --> 01:55:07.04 and
01:55:07.04 --> 01:55:08.24 You know
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:10.64 Some parts of the country took over a lot different
01:55:10.64 --> 01:55:13.12 I'll tell you this my guys that was there COVID
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:18.88 Like we just got after it now the only thing we did can so it was a kickoff of course, which you put your part of that but
01:55:19.60 --> 01:55:21.60 We just got after it and
01:55:21.60 --> 01:55:25.04 Which even crazier so this this this this group core tech
01:55:25.28 --> 01:55:29.44 I had lined up four or five big deals big companies to buy and
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:34.64 You know what we haven't talked about it so the founders that I bought these companies I call them the founders
01:55:35.04 --> 01:55:37.28 Made of some of the best men and women in the country
01:55:38.08 --> 01:55:41.76 We've been very lucky our strategies we buy the best brand in a given state
01:55:41.76 --> 01:55:45.04 We expand from their opening new offices
01:55:46.32 --> 01:55:49.12 And as you look at the map today, you know, we're
01:55:50.08 --> 01:55:53.36 We're we're getting there. We're kind of really southeast Midwest
01:55:53.92 --> 01:55:58.88 Mid Atlantic we're not west coast. We're not Texasia. We're not Pacific Northeast or New England
01:56:00.16 --> 01:56:06.64 But we're multi-billion dollar business just in our current footprint. Well, I buy these businesses from these founders who were guys that started with nothing
01:56:06.80 --> 01:56:10.88 They built these businesses and we give them good money for their businesses is great money
01:56:10.88 --> 01:56:18.16 Many of them most them reinvest a little bit into groundwork so they're my partners and they you know they give me counts on things like that
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:24.88 So as we're we're building these businesses buying these businesses. I needed to buy a few of these big ones and you know
01:56:25.28 --> 01:56:29.84 And I didn't see quartet for many many months. I think I've seen them five times and save invests
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:37.36 And they've given us a lot of money so we started on a buying bench and and I bought four the best brands in the country
01:56:37.36 --> 01:56:42.000 We do all our M&A and house so I do all them and they with my team
01:56:42.40 --> 01:56:48.08 Quartet a lot us to do that they were exactly as I thought they would be part of the reason I picked them going back to
01:56:48.56 --> 01:56:53.04 What we were talking about the importance of investing an ROI and leadership development and training
01:56:54.24 --> 01:56:56.24 They completely bought off on that
01:56:56.96 --> 01:57:00.24 It was net most PE firms. I should some PE firms
01:57:00.80 --> 01:57:03.04 You know they're looking for every penny to go to the bottom line
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:06.80 Never ever once have they said
01:57:07.44 --> 01:57:12.48 Don't do that or why are you doing that because it's part of who we are in the magic sauce and like what you look
01:57:12.88 --> 01:57:14.88 We've gone from 30 to 800
01:57:15.52 --> 01:57:17.52 We'll do cross a bay in this year
01:57:17.68 --> 01:57:22.56 You don't do that without investing in your people and you can't do all the job training
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:25.44 When you grow that fast so when I say it's lazy
01:57:25.44 --> 01:57:33.20 It's it's lazy in the sense that a small business can do that because echo and I can go and he'll teach me how to swing that wrench and
01:57:33.28 --> 01:57:35.28 Hopefully I'll be a good
01:57:35.52 --> 01:57:38.80 Mechanic at some point but you can't do that when you can you go from
01:57:39.52 --> 01:57:41.52 190 people to 4200 and
01:57:42.32 --> 01:57:43.20 You know
01:57:43.20 --> 01:57:48.24 360 thousand in payroll that was that was that was payroll from when you first bought the company
01:57:48.88 --> 01:57:51.92 I knew my wife and I could cover that maybe for a month or two if we had to
01:57:52.48 --> 01:57:54.48 slight 20 plus now
01:57:54.48 --> 01:57:58.80 It's so it's also real for me so the importance of investing and
01:57:59.36 --> 01:58:07.20 Not doing on the job the ROI for us has been I don't know if you could calculate it can't delay because it's built into everything we do at the company
01:58:07.20 --> 01:58:08.40 So it's not like
01:58:08.40 --> 01:58:12.96 one specific thing that makes this company great. It's it's thrown into the
01:58:13.68 --> 01:58:15.68 The mindset that culture
01:58:15.68 --> 01:58:23.76 It's so into everything that we try to do and it's a big piece of it as you know I mean, but it's thrown into that so I've never been asked for my board
01:58:24.88 --> 01:58:29.76 And I got some look I got legit guy. I'm up some legit guys on my board that have run public companies
01:58:29.92 --> 01:58:32.24 Some of the biggest sum services companies. They've never said
01:58:32.56 --> 01:58:38.48 Hey, what's just line item here leadership development. They've never said it because they know two we are because I gave him a book at first time
01:58:38.48 --> 01:58:40.48 I met
01:58:40.88 --> 01:58:42.88 I think it was project jocca
01:58:42.88 --> 01:58:46.08 I thought they yeah
01:58:46.08 --> 01:58:53.04 When you were talking about how the the culture gets into the system and it becomes part of who you are
01:58:53.44 --> 01:58:58.56 I was thinking so I was going to officer candidates school and when you're at officer candidate school
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:01.60 When you first show up there, it's you know, it's a
01:59:02.48 --> 01:59:05.28 total indoctrination boot camp style indoctrination
01:59:05.92 --> 01:59:11.28 And you what one of the rules the avalies weird rules one of the rules is that you can't look at your food
01:59:11.28 --> 01:59:15.20 So you sit down to eat and you can't look at your food. You can only look straight ahead
01:59:16.48 --> 01:59:21.92 And remember I was an enlisted guy from my first eight years and I'm kind of street smart
01:59:22.32 --> 01:59:27.12 So I'm sitting down and I got to eat and I think it was like chicken breast right?
01:59:27.12 --> 01:59:30.32 So how you gonna eat a chicken breast without looking at like how's that even gonna work right?
01:59:31.28 --> 01:59:36.32 But also I'm thinking how are they possibly gonna see if I'd glance down on my food right?
01:59:36.32 --> 01:59:41.20 So and really the people there's drill instructors so there's marine core drill instructors there
01:59:41.28 --> 01:59:47.44 But there's also the senior officer candidates are there so there so there so there are everyone to watching you when you get into the
01:59:47.44 --> 01:59:51.60 Chowhall for the first couple month the very all time but the first couple meals where this happened to me
01:59:51.84 --> 01:59:54.88 So I'm sitting there I sit down you know and people are yelling screaming
01:59:55.52 --> 02:00:02.16 You know don't look at your food look straight ahead. They call it squaring your meals also you have to lift your your food has to go up
02:00:02.72 --> 02:00:04.08 straight, you know
02:00:04.08 --> 02:00:10.80 90 degrees up from the ground from the plate you have to bring it up straight and then you know 90 degree turn into your mouth
02:00:10.80 --> 02:00:13.36 That's how you got to eat they call it squaring your meals you have to look straight ahead
02:00:14.24 --> 02:00:17.60 So as I'm sitting there I'm thinking they're never gonna be able to tell them look at my food
02:00:17.60 --> 02:00:21.12 I'm just gonna glance down and get it you know see what part of the chicken breast I'm about to eat
02:00:21.12 --> 02:00:23.60 So I kind of glance down there and it's soon a
02:00:24.24 --> 02:00:26.24 A millisecond after I look down
02:00:26.80 --> 02:00:32.32 They're like oh, what are you doing and they get it and I was thinking myself how did they see that so fast forward
02:00:32.32 --> 02:00:35.92 10 weeks or 11 weeks now. I'm one of the senior people and
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:39.04 I'm standing at the end of the table and
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.52 Everyone is staring straight ahead and it and when one person glances down for a half a second
02:00:45.52 --> 02:00:51.60 It's so blatantly obvious it stands out so much even though you wouldn't think and they could see you
02:00:51.60 --> 02:00:58.24 It stands out blatantly obvious and that's the that's what I think happens inside these companies that we work with where
02:00:58.24 --> 02:01:02.88 You get this attitude of ownership and when it starts to sink in
02:01:04.24 --> 02:01:08.16 Anybody on the team that's like well, you know, that's actually is it my fault
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:14.24 It is like so obvious to everyone and eventually it becomes obvious to yourself
02:01:14.56 --> 02:01:17.92 Eventually as you're about to say well, you know, this isn't really my fault. This is
02:01:18.72 --> 02:01:23.44 And you can't even get those words out of your mouth instead you say you know what what can I do to fix this problem?
02:01:23.44 --> 02:01:29.52 And it's it's a beautiful thing to say it's a beautiful thing to see and when you get that when you get that whole
02:01:31.28 --> 02:01:39.20 Attitude that culture in so deep man. It's really becomes unstoppable it really does because everyone on the team now becomes
02:01:39.76 --> 02:01:43.12 They're looking to solve problems. They're not looking to blame. They're looking to solve problems
02:01:43.44 --> 02:01:47.60 You combine that with decentralized command. They're have the authority to solve problems
02:01:47.60 --> 02:01:53.92 They know they can fix that problem for a hundred dollars and you know what's even also? You know, we're talking about that example
02:01:53.92 --> 02:01:56.16 You got somebody's part of the foundations a little bit messed up
02:01:57.92 --> 02:02:07.20 The attitude he fixed that problem that problems probably not happening because going into that moment when they were about to set that fixture
02:02:07.76 --> 02:02:10.48 That guy says hey, you know what if this isn't good
02:02:11.36 --> 02:02:17.28 I know I'm gonna have to fix it and I know if it's not good and it's gonna cost money to fix it
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:20.80 I'm gonna have to call my super advisor and say hey, I mess this up and you know
02:02:20.80 --> 02:02:22.80 We're gonna have to eat this one
02:02:22.80 --> 02:02:26.80 So you get that preemptive ownership where people care more about the job
02:02:26.80 --> 02:02:31.28 They want to do it correctly the first time because they are taking ownership
02:02:31.28 --> 02:02:35.76 You know that's one of the bad things about extreme ownership is the first books all about oh
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:41.36 Extreme ownership is in the past it's a mistake that happened and oh, it's my fault which is good
02:02:41.76 --> 02:02:43.36 But what's even better than that?
02:02:43.36 --> 02:02:48.56 I'm not if you let that mistake happen and that's what when you when you have it infuse like you have it at your company
02:02:48.80 --> 02:02:51.60 People are allowing that for those things to happen and
02:02:52.56 --> 02:02:58.16 And that's a powerful thing and then you reinforce that behavior by when they when they do make it
02:02:58.16 --> 02:03:04.84 Session or there is a mistake you say no problem. Yep. I'd rather make that mistake and and not get on the guy for overcorrecting
02:03:04.84 --> 02:03:08.92 Right, then undercorrecting and that feeds on itself too like if they know okay
02:03:08.92 --> 02:03:14.20 Like I was empowered to make this decision and I might have gone overkill and maybe I laid down more track and I needed to
02:03:14.20 --> 02:03:16.52 Or maybe this is how but it's perfect. So perfect job
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:21.08 You say okay you probably overbuilt that behavior. Good good for on you you took care of the customer
02:03:21.08 --> 02:03:26.16 We call it you know protecting the patch you got to protect the brand. Yeah, so you know
02:03:28.28 --> 02:03:31.96 A little bit you know you you've you've you've glass on this couple times and we've been on for a little bit
02:03:31.96 --> 02:03:34.36 But I just wanted before you before you kind of close out
02:03:34.36 --> 02:03:40.20 You know one thing you you mentioned a couple times was you know that the fact that we we got an average age of
02:03:40.20 --> 02:03:43.32 Well, there's that your company your prior company was 54 years old
02:03:44.20 --> 02:03:48.20 As you know, I'm also in the business of people working with their hands
02:03:48.20 --> 02:03:53.72 We've got we've got people that are manufacturing things in America that haven't been manufactured a long time here
02:03:54.52 --> 02:03:57.64 Passing on we were lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge
02:03:57.64 --> 02:04:03.24 You know Pete was lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge from some of these people that were older than 54 years old
02:04:03.24 --> 02:04:11.48 You know that were 65 we've lost some of those those mentors at origin that were passing on first hand knowledge of how to do this stuff
02:04:12.76 --> 02:04:15.72 Is there something that we could do better as a country
02:04:17.08 --> 02:04:20.76 To help steer people in the right direction. I know I just worked with a
02:04:21.40 --> 02:04:28.60 University up and up in Indiana called called Ivy Ivy Tech and they teach traits that's what they're doing and
02:04:29.24 --> 02:04:31.72 You know I had an interesting conversation with them
02:04:31.72 --> 02:04:37.56 It's like the the highest paying job that you can get out of Ivy Tech is a elevator
02:04:38.28 --> 02:04:39.48 Repairment
02:04:39.48 --> 02:04:46.76 Elevator repairman and they make like 80 grand coming out of that school you make 80 grand a year and you got a you got a
02:04:47.56 --> 02:04:49.88 Job a career all life
02:04:50.20 --> 02:04:59.08 What how are how are we failing to educate the the young people in America that they don't necessarily have to go to college
02:04:59.08 --> 02:05:03.40 They don't necessarily have to get a degree and they don't necessarily have to look for
02:05:04.12 --> 02:05:05.80 Some kind of a job
02:05:05.80 --> 02:05:11.16 Some kind of a white collar job that if you go and you get a trade and you learn how to do something
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:13.16 And I always say this the seal teams
02:05:14.04 --> 02:05:19.32 On the enlisted side this is as blue colors it gets I mean, that's what you're doing you're working a machine gun
02:05:19.72 --> 02:05:24.76 You're you're building demolition charges your it is and you're moving company
02:05:24.76 --> 02:05:26.76 We always joke about the fact of always moving stuff
02:05:26.76 --> 02:05:30.28 But where are we making that mistake how could we do better in America
02:05:32.04 --> 02:05:36.52 Well, I think it starts with the perception of these these jobs, right so
02:05:37.80 --> 02:05:39.48 If you think about
02:05:39.48 --> 02:05:44.28 At home right the parents thank now hey, I don't want you to be a plumber. I want you to go to college
02:05:44.92 --> 02:05:47.48 Well if you look at the data you say okay look it you got a
02:05:48.04 --> 02:05:53.08 Was it 1.6 train of college debt and you have no and I don't want to fend anybody but this will
02:05:53.08 --> 02:06:00.04 He have you're getting you know degrees and like art history right now no fence the art history
02:06:00.36 --> 02:06:06.12 But how many historians of art do you think they're or in the world that actually operate as art historians?
02:06:07.64 --> 02:06:09.64 Seven they can't be many right
02:06:09.64 --> 02:06:15.32 I mean I don't know but they're they're not the they're not thousands of these jobs and what do they pay?
02:06:15.96 --> 02:06:19.40 So there's this perception how you go to college as your ticket well
02:06:19.40 --> 02:06:25.72 The data would actually show if you if you if you if you do a skill trade at least my experience
02:06:25.72 --> 02:06:30.20 So we unemployment division as well look you you have you have plumbers that easily make
02:06:30.60 --> 02:06:32.20 80 96 figures
02:06:32.20 --> 02:06:36.60 I know welders that worked for us a shipyard staffing if you're not making six figures you're not any good
02:06:37.56 --> 02:06:43.72 at groundworks you know a good form and a good form and it's 90 to a hundred 20 thousand dollars a year
02:06:44.04 --> 02:06:46.04 now you got to work for it
02:06:46.04 --> 02:06:47.56 but think about
02:06:47.56 --> 02:06:49.56 the perception of
02:06:49.80 --> 02:06:54.52 a hidden high school saying hey look I'm gonna go do be electrician now that's a skill that will
02:06:55.08 --> 02:06:59.64 They can go anywhere and do anything and I would argue economically and today is world
02:07:00.04 --> 02:07:04.92 Their value is only increasing because there's fewer and fewer scarcity does cost you it does drive value
02:07:05.64 --> 02:07:08.84 So as a college I believe it's this this we've been shoved
02:07:09.32 --> 02:07:13.000 this idea for the last 20 25 years that you have to go to college to be successful
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.92 That has to change how does that change it's it's can't really parents
02:07:19.32 --> 02:07:24.44 I always believe it starts at home the perception of hey Mike Magiani and Sally whatever they need to go to college
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:29.000 you'd be successful not for everyone I'll tell you just a quick story at groundworks
02:07:29.40 --> 02:07:32.92 I have a and you know flink popcorn joined our companies to be with EF
02:07:34.12 --> 02:07:39.16 You know Harvard Business School McKinsey he's divisional vice president of our East Coast division our Eastern division
02:07:39.16 --> 02:07:44.92 He is a counterpart at West his name is Jeffrey Martin. Jeffrey Martin went to Moverly High School
02:07:46.92 --> 02:07:53.32 That's where he went so this notion of meritocracy is alive and well at groundworks and that's just a perfect example of it
02:07:53.96 --> 02:08:00.04 if if we if we if we celebrate the minimum and that work with their hands and not demean them we'll get more of them
02:08:01.16 --> 02:08:04.92 And then I think look there has to be some kind of mindset that that says oh
02:08:04.92 --> 02:08:10.20 We as a country need to unite around developing more skill trades and pushing it back down to the high school
02:08:10.20 --> 02:08:15.94 I don't know if you know, but I don't know any high schools that really have you know that kind of craft
02:08:15.94 --> 02:08:23.72 And it's not for everybody look on a college is not for everybody, but there are there are there are things we need to do as a country
02:08:23.72 --> 02:08:26.28 And I know you you know this better than me
02:08:26.28 --> 02:08:33.16 You know men and women that lead this country from a legislative standpoint need to figure out a way to push this agenda because if they don't
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:38.60 Nassurcurity National Security and my view will be at risk I only know that from shipyard staffing and
02:08:39.40 --> 02:08:41.80 If you can't repair these boats and you can't build them
02:08:42.68 --> 02:08:46.12 And I don't even that's not even including planes and tanks and everything else
02:08:46.76 --> 02:08:48.76 They still has to be welded
02:08:50.36 --> 02:08:52.36 An art history degrees not gonna get you there
02:08:53.24 --> 02:08:58.60 So how how we solve this as a country look again my view has to start at home parents need to think okay
02:08:58.60 --> 02:09:06.12 They're still a great livelihood for my my son or daughter by being a skill tradesman and we have to as a society
02:09:06.68 --> 02:09:08.68 Celebrate it
02:09:08.68 --> 02:09:11.08 Like part of the thing at ground works is we're celebrating profession
02:09:11.08 --> 02:09:14.60 We we honor you because you work with your hands you're you're not beneath me
02:09:15.16 --> 02:09:19.40 Now most of these art history majors they end up slinging you coffee at Starbucks, right?
02:09:19.40 --> 02:09:21.56 So you know you look at I mean you say okay
02:09:22.04 --> 02:09:24.68 There's two hundred grand down the toilet that you and I will have to pay for
02:09:24.68 --> 02:09:28.28 Conversely you go to all the parents out there if you have kids
02:09:28.68 --> 02:09:34.44 They can go to a trade school they come out not in that but making money and they you know
02:09:34.44 --> 02:09:40.92 They have a nice six figure job all to make a ton of money. So it's it's it's to has to start at home
02:09:40.92 --> 02:09:42.28 But I think legislative
02:09:42.28 --> 02:09:48.36 Legislative we we need to do better at celebrating the skill trades and put a concerted effort on building it
02:09:48.76 --> 02:09:50.76 Just like you would build a military
02:09:51.48 --> 02:09:53.48 It's it's really what we're building
02:09:53.48 --> 02:09:55.48 And then
02:09:55.72 --> 02:10:00.84 Like you mentioned I'm I'm in the manufacturing business well doing it here in America beautiful
02:10:02.12 --> 02:10:05.32 You guys are are you how much are you able to
02:10:05.88 --> 02:10:10.76 Keep your manufacturing in America. It's all in America. So I didn't mention this, but we're vertically integrated as you know
02:10:10.76 --> 02:10:13.32 We bought we have our software business, but we make our own
02:10:14.20 --> 02:10:16.20 Steel products as well so
02:10:16.20 --> 02:10:20.92 Get too technical because you're fall asleep, but you know when we when we secure foundations we get to the footer
02:10:20.92 --> 02:10:24.36 We put brackets on and we drive steel to support the foundations of a home
02:10:24.92 --> 02:10:26.92 Well all that steel
02:10:26.92 --> 02:10:32.60 We've abandoned our own products and we we actually make it in a hundred twenty thousand square foot facility in Rosewood, South Carolina
02:10:33.08 --> 02:10:38.76 You know we have we have lasers and and and machines and you know 40 guys out there get an after it
02:10:38.76 --> 02:10:41.48 So that's not imported steel we do it right here in America
02:10:43.08 --> 02:10:47.80 You know all our pumps and de-hues also made here in America. It's it's our little part
02:10:47.80 --> 02:10:55.000 To serve the countries if you can do it you should do it and again we we're not big manufacturers like you guys, but
02:10:55.64 --> 02:11:00.60 If you're going to serve the country in any little way you need to serve the country in part way of serve in the country is
02:11:00.84 --> 02:11:03.56 Make it here in America. I think we saw with pandemic and
02:11:04.44 --> 02:11:07.24 What's going on in China and the rest of the world hey man
02:11:08.28 --> 02:11:15.08 It'd be nice to have a supply chain from from some South Carolina versus from India and it's sitting off the coast here right now
02:11:15.40 --> 02:11:16.44 in a boat
02:11:16.44 --> 02:11:21.96 I've always I'm a very lucky person and in a lot of different ways, but certainly
02:11:23.48 --> 02:11:25.48 the luck
02:11:25.24 --> 02:11:29.48 the luck of being a kind of obsessed with building stuff in America and
02:11:29.88 --> 02:11:34.04 Having that supply chain up and you know Pete and the rest of the team at origin
02:11:34.60 --> 02:11:35.88 you know
02:11:35.88 --> 02:11:39.80 We when COVID hit we were kind of looking around had look we were
02:11:40.44 --> 02:11:45.24 It was horrible. I have you know people are losing their jobs. It was horrible, but we were kind of looking around like notting our head going
02:11:45.24 --> 02:11:48.92 We were on the right path and we're not worried about we're not we don't have
02:11:49.24 --> 02:11:53.48 We don't have containers sitting off the coast of wherever waiting to
02:11:54.04 --> 02:11:59.08 Waiting to get here. We have our supply chain. It's an American supply chain and then like you said
02:12:00.52 --> 02:12:07.08 We're employing Americans and we got people that are are building this country and and taking these skills
02:12:07.08 --> 02:12:09.64 You know how to conversation with someone's talking about
02:12:10.44 --> 02:12:14.68 You know people people not being fit for the military right you can sure you've seen articles like that
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:20.20 You know they say that the kids are spending so much time on video games or whatever that they don't even be
02:12:20.92 --> 02:12:22.92 Fit to join the military
02:12:22.92 --> 02:12:28.76 You know and I kind of said well who's gonna fight the wars if a war comes? Well, this is a very similar thing
02:12:28.76 --> 02:12:35.16 Right who's gonna weld the ships who's gonna manufacture the weapons who's gonna actually have the skills to do that
02:12:35.88 --> 02:12:38.52 and yeah, that's the idea
02:12:39.88 --> 02:12:40.68 I think
02:12:40.68 --> 02:12:42.68 You you mentioned that
02:12:42.68 --> 02:12:47.48 Who's going to a technical schools nowadays you know it's just I don't even know
02:12:48.76 --> 02:12:56.20 Like the high school or my kids went they they don't they are trying now to reopen the the the
02:12:56.20 --> 02:13:01.48 Auto motive you know repair section when I went to high school all the kids were working on cars
02:13:01.48 --> 02:13:07.56 It was part of you know everyone was building their own car and and doing that and then a lot of them went on to do that for a living
02:13:07.56 --> 02:13:11.88 Where's that where who's gonna do this stuff now if we don't refocus
02:13:12.84 --> 02:13:14.84 America on
02:13:14.84 --> 02:13:19.08 On the the skills that we need as a nation to be self-sufficient
02:13:20.60 --> 02:13:24.52 Could not agree more just don't need to say more could not agree more and
02:13:25.24 --> 02:13:28.84 If it's not done, Jocca there would be real ramifications to it right I mean
02:13:29.56 --> 02:13:32.28 It's a it's a silent killer at the moment because it's getting done
02:13:33.40 --> 02:13:35.40 people don't even know it
02:13:35.40 --> 02:13:37.40 Again average age
02:13:37.96 --> 02:13:41.32 I've read that average as you be in manufacturing job in the country's 55
02:13:42.20 --> 02:13:45.96 average age yeah, I got to throw one more thing out there because I've I've
02:13:46.84 --> 02:13:50.84 Just for anyone that's 18 19 20 22 years old whatever you are
02:13:51.88 --> 02:13:57.40 A lot of times I talk to people and they say well, you know, I don't want to be doing that kind of physical labor my whole life
02:13:57.40 --> 02:14:02.76 Well, I'm gonna tell you right now if you go if you become an electrician or you become a plumber
02:14:02.76 --> 02:14:09.72 You're not gonna do that if you're if you're smart in your hardworking and you really get after it and you have the intention
02:14:10.44 --> 02:14:13.40 Of elevating in that environment
02:14:13.88 --> 02:14:17.72 You will absolutely do it. I mean who's the guy you were talking about that's a high school graduate
02:14:18.44 --> 02:14:25.72 That's a Jeffrey Martin. So yeah, so Jeffrey Martin. Is he is he right now how old is Jeffrey Martin? 32 32 has dad owned the business
02:14:25.72 --> 02:14:32.20 He started okay, so he was slaying in steel at like 14 or 15 right so his experience level is crazy
02:14:32.20 --> 02:14:36.04 Right, so but he did 20 years is sling in steel
02:14:36.52 --> 02:14:45.000 He's not in a crawl space anymore, you know, and so my point is that and I've got all I've got multiple friends like this that started off
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.60 They were electrician and
02:14:46.84 --> 02:14:50.68 They were an electrician for four years six years and in all the sudden they
02:14:51.16 --> 02:14:55.32 Got put in charge of two electricians and then they got put in charge of four electricians
02:14:55.32 --> 02:14:57.72 Then they went and said you know what if I'm gonna be running four electricians
02:14:57.72 --> 02:15:01.16 I might as well just have my own business, right and they start their own businesses and
02:15:01.16 --> 02:15:05.40 And now they have 28 electricians working for me and you can go in any one of these trades
02:15:05.72 --> 02:15:11.08 If you have the mindset and you want to learn and you want to grow and you want to you want to take a little extra time to
02:15:11.16 --> 02:15:14.68 Understand the financial part of it if you have that mindset
02:15:15.16 --> 02:15:20.52 You can run you can run any kind of business that you want so don't think when
02:15:20.92 --> 02:15:25.24 I'm sitting here or Matt sitting here saying hey, we need people that are gonna know how to weld
02:15:25.64 --> 02:15:30.04 We do but this doesn't mean you're gonna be necessarily welding until you're 62 years old
02:15:30.04 --> 02:15:33.16 You can if you want to that's correct, but if your goal is to
02:15:34.12 --> 02:15:37.80 Is to grow out of that role you'll have the experience to do it
02:15:37.80 --> 02:15:43.80 You'll have the money to do it and you will definitely in this country have the opportunity to do it
02:15:43.80 --> 02:15:48.52 That's what America provides 100% the notion that by the way you can't be educated
02:15:49.96 --> 02:15:54.60 By not going to college is false the notion is you go to college you get educated
02:15:54.60 --> 02:16:00.84 You can be educated by doing your craft and still learning and being a learned adult
02:16:01.16 --> 02:16:02.84 You just have to take the time to do it
02:16:02.84 --> 02:16:07.56 You have to read the books you have to study on your own there's the notion that these some things
02:16:07.56 --> 02:16:12.12 It'll 100% correlate it or wrong. That's part of the mindset is I know a lot of very smart
02:16:12.12 --> 02:16:16.20 Forman a lot of very smart form you join our company you start as an installer
02:16:16.36 --> 02:16:22.60 Take sure you're to get to a form if you're any good then after that a couple years you can move to super and then production
02:16:22.60 --> 02:16:27.08 Manager and then ultimately to general manager then all three two regional manager and then division
02:16:27.08 --> 02:16:32.12 And then hopefully one day CEO, but the point is you still have to take and do the work
02:16:32.84 --> 02:16:38.68 Do the work of growing your mind investing in yourself and you don't have to have a sheep skin to say it
02:16:38.92 --> 02:16:44.76 You just have to have the mindset to go learn and and the notion that the two are or a
02:16:45.08 --> 02:16:49.72 Separated is as a fallacy in my opinion and it's it's just all you know he you mentioned
02:16:49.72 --> 02:16:55.48 Peter Teal right Peter Teal like he's he's hiring people and he's been doing that
02:16:55.48 --> 02:16:59.32 He doesn't care if you want to college or not and he's running a freaking you know he's running a giant
02:17:00.28 --> 02:17:05.08 Giant company that's that's moving money billions of dollars look at all these founders out
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:08.84 These big founders the big name founders as you see out there musk and feel and and
02:17:10.04 --> 02:17:11.56 Duck and all these guys
02:17:11.56 --> 02:17:13.56 They don't have a degree
02:17:13.56 --> 02:17:15.56 I call them zuck at like I don't know
02:17:15.56 --> 02:17:23.56 Yeah, that's your real awesome stuff probably a good place. We get to the it's so we let's just look where we at right now
02:17:24.04 --> 02:17:26.28 Groundworks what's the what's the future?
02:17:26.92 --> 02:17:28.92 Well, I think ultimately
02:17:29.16 --> 02:17:33.72 We want to continue the mission of course expand. I look at I think all of this is a public company
02:17:33.72 --> 02:17:37.48 I think we're we're getting to the point we're gonna be so big you're gonna need to cap it
02:17:37.48 --> 02:17:41.24 I'll tell you I'll tell me go public I think right now if you think about our business
02:17:41.24 --> 02:17:43.72 We are in the water management displacement business
02:17:43.72 --> 02:17:46.60 But you know we operate with an MPS
02:17:47.32 --> 02:17:51.64 Over 70 MPS is net promoter squads how you measure your performance with consumers
02:17:52.44 --> 02:17:59.08 You know we're gonna move into other home services lines we we believe are our mindset and our ability to
02:17:59.08 --> 02:18:03.32 Service the customer we think their other lines so we can get into the further expand our business
02:18:03.96 --> 02:18:05.96 You know gutters and
02:18:06.12 --> 02:18:09.72 Plumbing and other things like we're just beginning to build this business and so
02:18:09.72 --> 02:18:16.68 Ultimately, I think groundworks will be my passion will be that this this is a business last a hundred years
02:18:17.80 --> 02:18:19.32 that
02:18:19.32 --> 02:18:23.000 A business that celebrates again many women that work with their hands
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.12 They can go for a not a job but for a profession
02:18:27.08 --> 02:18:32.76 That's built with a with a common sense of respect and dignity where it's a true meritocracy that doesn't matter
02:18:32.76 --> 02:18:38.60 Where you come from what degree you have that you can come to a company like groundworks and make it to the very top
02:18:40.20 --> 02:18:44.20 That so that's where we're going that's where we're going. I do I have look you hurt my career
02:18:44.52 --> 02:18:50.76 It's a little bumpy and and uh it's you know my buddies call me the force gump of finance and some of these stores like that
02:18:50.76 --> 02:18:52.52 Brother that can't be true. Last where it's all true
02:18:53.64 --> 02:18:57.16 But I don't know I just know if we build something great you invest in people
02:18:57.80 --> 02:18:59.80 You surround yourself with really smart people
02:18:59.80 --> 02:19:02.92 And you and you you push them to grow and be better
02:19:03.40 --> 02:19:08.92 You can do anything. Okay. I think that's that's where we go in it. I if I could just make one final comment
02:19:11.32 --> 02:19:15.88 Is you think about your listeners. Do you think about kind of how we started?
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000 I would just say this if if you truly
02:19:19.88 --> 02:19:23.88 Sitting there and you want to be in business. You want to be an entrepreneur and you but you want to invest in yourself
02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000 And you believe that that ultimately
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.28 You get the life you give yourself that
02:19:31.08 --> 02:19:33.96 You can do it you can do it if you
02:19:34.68 --> 02:19:36.68 Put in the time you have the discipline
02:19:37.24 --> 02:19:39.24 You're obsessed about whatever it is
02:19:40.36 --> 02:19:45.48 I hope you know the dialogue and you gathered from our conversation that you in this country
02:19:46.04 --> 02:19:48.04 If you can do it and
02:19:48.68 --> 02:19:50.04 a guy like me
02:19:50.04 --> 02:19:53.48 Yeah, no cool drag or promotion view you know sitting down here with the
02:19:53.48 --> 02:19:55.48 So
02:19:56.20 --> 02:19:59.16 Jaco and his team and the best podcast in the country and
02:20:00.04 --> 02:20:03.24 The folks I've been able to to meet and my career
02:20:03.80 --> 02:20:07.16 But most importantly you can you can really do the impossible
02:20:07.88 --> 02:20:09.88 if you really just go after it and
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:14.36 That's that's I hope you'll listen or take away is that anything is possible
02:20:14.92 --> 02:20:18.12 It truly is just you just gotta go do it and it's not easy
02:20:18.12 --> 02:20:24.92 Oh no and there's gonna be nights and your wife's gonna look at you and say don't mess on that email and you're gonna have to get up
02:20:24.92 --> 02:20:28.76 And you're gonna take risks and you're gonna do things and you're not gonna win every time and
02:20:30.04 --> 02:20:34.12 And that's when it counts that's what when when you say you gotta keep going
02:20:34.12 --> 02:20:35.24 That's when it counts
02:20:35.24 --> 02:20:39.96 It's a different to find a hardship. That's the only way to get better looking I'm not a seal. I'll never serve
02:20:39.96 --> 02:20:43.56 But I'm sure that's how you guys look at it but business business is no different
02:20:43.56 --> 02:20:50.76 And you know that you're not your nerd the ups and downs characters really you learn more on failure than you do on victory and
02:20:51.48 --> 02:20:58.12 And they just a character is defined by the things that make you a better person and a better business person
02:20:58.12 --> 02:21:03.80 You know we we believe that at ground works we talk about walking in the light the goal is to make everyone a better human
02:21:04.68 --> 02:21:07.000 And if you're better human you're better professional and
02:21:08.20 --> 02:21:12.76 You know, I joked about the Catholic thing to begin with the morality that kind of instilled
02:21:12.76 --> 02:21:19.000 But you can do the impossible if you do walk in the light you care about others you lead with a servant heart
02:21:21.24 --> 02:21:25.56 You you make the mistakes you do you you you make the investments you take the risk
02:21:25.96 --> 02:21:29.32 You get up every day even if it's off the ground and you do it again
02:21:29.88 --> 02:21:32.60 And if I can do it any one can do it
02:21:33.16 --> 02:21:35.16 That's America
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:40.20 Echo Charles any questions. Yeah. You have what shark tank? Yes, sir is that your jam that's not my jam
02:21:40.20 --> 02:21:47.48 You know it's funny. I actually tell Sarah's I hate that they're stealing these companies from these people you know that the valuations are given these guys
02:21:47.48 --> 02:21:49.48 It's interesting
02:21:50.04 --> 02:21:53.48 So if you ever have an idea don't go on shark tank you come to see
02:21:54.76 --> 02:21:57.64 Better deal baby. Okay, all right. Oh you also said
02:21:58.36 --> 02:22:00.20 Kind of impassing you mentioned
02:22:00.20 --> 02:22:05.08 Lifestyle business you said it was a lifestyle business and you kind of what does that mean lifestyle business?
02:22:05.08 --> 02:22:12.28 So there there are a lot of owners out there that don't reinvest in their business. They they take money out of the business to
02:22:12.60 --> 02:22:18.60 You know by a house or second house or boat or you know that we call those lifestyle businesses and
02:22:20.20 --> 02:22:24.28 Their nice lifestyle business, but there's no long-term viability and health for those things
02:22:24.28 --> 02:22:26.84 They though they'll die as soon as that better owner dies
02:22:26.84 --> 02:22:32.04 So what like kind of almost like they have the business just so they can make money for their lifestyle
02:22:32.04 --> 02:22:38.12 That's right. Yeah, it's supposed to reinvesting every penny they have to make it grow into build it
02:22:38.12 --> 02:22:43.80 Etc. You see a lot of the looks but a lot of small businesses are lifestyle business and there's nothing wrong with that
02:22:44.20 --> 02:22:47.56 But when you can when we compete with lifestyle businesses you can imagine
02:22:48.44 --> 02:22:50.44 It's so ugly
02:22:50.44 --> 02:22:52.44 I want to competition
02:22:52.44 --> 02:22:57.56 Cool good to see you right on well Matt thanks coming on thanks for sharing some of these lessons
02:22:57.56 --> 02:23:04.76 And most important thanks for what you're doing today. I mean you can probably hear when I talk about this and I talk about all the time and I live it to
02:23:05.88 --> 02:23:07.88 the fact that you're
02:23:07.88 --> 02:23:09.88 building a company that is
02:23:11.48 --> 02:23:16.68 Well, it first of all it's providing a much needed service right? I mean like you said it's the American dream to have a house
02:23:16.68 --> 02:23:19.32 It's not the American dream to have a house with a basement full of water
02:23:20.60 --> 02:23:22.84 But but you not only provide that service, but
02:23:22.84 --> 02:23:28.68 You know you give ownership to your workforce and they get a skill and they get a career
02:23:29.96 --> 02:23:32.20 It's just powerful and that that helps
02:23:33.32 --> 02:23:37.48 That is that is what drives the American economy. That's what does it and
02:23:38.20 --> 02:23:39.88 That attitude
02:23:39.88 --> 02:23:43.72 That attitude that work ethic that's the American culture
02:23:44.52 --> 02:23:50.92 And and look the American culture might get might get pushed around a little bit it might get it might get some layers
02:23:50.92 --> 02:23:56.04 Put on it by various things that are going on in the world, but the American culture of
02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000 Hard work the culture of
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.64 Entrepreneurship and the culture that
02:24:02.52 --> 02:24:04.52 Superseeds all those
02:24:04.52 --> 02:24:10.84 Is the culture of taking care of your family taking care of your friends taking care of your community taking care of your people
02:24:11.48 --> 02:24:17.48 That's the American way and that's how you win and thank you for being an example of making that happen
02:24:17.48 --> 02:24:25.08 Thank you sir and with that Mr. Matt Malone has left the building so
02:24:26.68 --> 02:24:28.68 That will turn off yes, sir
02:24:29.24 --> 02:24:31.24 Did you get a little bit of the
02:24:32.44 --> 02:24:38.12 Beyond the shark tank on that because for you I think I think I think in your mind business is kind of like shark tank
02:24:38.12 --> 02:24:44.84 Actually you're kind of right. No, I think like legit yeah
02:24:45.88 --> 02:24:47.08 Yeah, well
02:24:47.08 --> 02:24:53.08 Like anything you know you have kind of what's in front of your face and that goes through like your life I guess when you kind of go through it
02:24:53.72 --> 02:24:57.40 And then every once in all you get reminded that there's this bigger game being played or
02:24:58.36 --> 02:25:03.16 Even a smaller game being played that plays a bigger role in your life, you know like that kind of stuff
02:25:03.16 --> 02:25:11.000 And this is like one of those reminders where he's over here talking about like he early on in the pot in this episode
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:17.48 He was he just mentioned like derivative. So I didn't want to do that like kind of like it was just as foregone everyone knows that kind of a tone
02:25:18.76 --> 02:25:23.96 And a lot of these terms that he was using it was like wait and that was gonna interrupt
02:25:23.96 --> 02:25:26.36 But you know in the spirit of keeping the flow I didn't
02:25:26.36 --> 02:25:32.76 Um, where I wanted to interrupt me like wait, what's that wait, what's that wait? What's that because it would tell like clear story for us
02:25:33.16 --> 02:25:35.16 We're not in that big game
02:25:35.16 --> 02:25:40.92 to understand a little bit more about how it works. Yeah, well, the I guess
02:25:41.72 --> 02:25:47.56 The trying to get like you said trying to get to the kind of ultimate position where we got to where he is now
02:25:47.96 --> 02:25:52.68 I think was cool and I think that's and plus maybe I was just like going yeah
02:25:52.68 --> 02:26:01.24 Dribbrips, yeah, it's clear that you are probably not the best person to filter some of that stuff out or to
02:26:01.80 --> 02:26:04.44 inquire about it, but what's interesting to
02:26:05.48 --> 02:26:12.44 Well the the each one like each one of those things is stone world, right and what are you calling it next level?
02:26:12.44 --> 02:26:16.76 What are you saying big game? No play there's different games man, and then there's games
02:26:16.76 --> 02:26:25.24 Within the games, but then more importantly to remember you're in there's a game that's bigger than the game you're in and that's what's always happening
02:26:25.24 --> 02:26:31.48 Yeah, and you got to be careful in life that you don't get trapped in the game and
02:26:31.88 --> 02:26:38.44 Think that you won that game because there's a bigger game going on. Yes, you need to watch out for it now. Listen, here's the thing
02:26:39.48 --> 02:26:41.48 You could never
02:26:41.96 --> 02:26:46.36 Very few people are just gonna win every game like all the games the big game, right?
02:26:46.36 --> 02:26:51.000 What do you got to do? What's the winning the biggest game? Is it Elon Musk and he won the like the big game?
02:26:52.04 --> 02:26:55.24 Could be but also there's some people that don't care about any of that
02:26:55.72 --> 02:26:58.84 So it's important remember that do you care about the game that someone else is playing
02:26:59.40 --> 02:27:03.000 This is comes back this whole discussion we had one time
02:27:03.88 --> 02:27:09.16 Where I was I compared basketball and soccer right like someone's playing soccer the best soccer playing the world
02:27:09.56 --> 02:27:13.48 In their whole season they score four goals and they're the best at that game
02:27:13.48 --> 02:27:19.72 Me while someone plays basketball they score four goals in the first minute and in the season they play they score
02:27:20.20 --> 02:27:21.72 thousand points
02:27:21.72 --> 02:27:26.04 So what game are you playing and you got to be careful because you might be
02:27:26.60 --> 02:27:32.76 I've known plenty of people in my day and I'm sure you have two that worked really really really hard and
02:27:32.84 --> 02:27:35.64 One the game that they were playing and we're winning that game
02:27:37.24 --> 02:27:39.64 But it but it was limited
02:27:39.64 --> 02:27:46.12 You know they weren't really barely even getting on the board so you want to make sure that you're playing a game that you can win
02:27:46.12 --> 02:27:51.40 And then you also at a certain point you say look I don't really care about that next level game. Yeah. I don't I don't care about that
02:27:51.40 --> 02:27:59.88 I don't need to win the game above my game and the game above that game. Right. I don't care about those games because
02:28:01.16 --> 02:28:06.28 Basically the games we're talking about right now are all business financial earning games
02:28:06.28 --> 02:28:13.08 Because you know you got a game that you're playing to win with your family to win with your legacy to pass on good
02:28:13.08 --> 02:28:19.16 behaviors to your children to help your community to build good relationships like there's that too
02:28:19.16 --> 02:28:21.16 Your health your health
02:28:21.16 --> 02:28:28.20 Right, so we're gonna ban in those things so I think it's important to and I think I think Matt spent quite a bit of time doing that
02:28:28.36 --> 02:28:32.68 Playing a game and not necessarily winning a game but saying I don't even want to play that game. Yeah. Oh
02:28:32.68 --> 02:28:38.52 I'm trying this other game. I don't like that game. Oh, I'm trying another game. I don't really like that game and finally figured out. Oh
02:28:38.68 --> 02:28:44.04 Here's a game that I like I actually want to be an operator that makes stuff happen. I want to interact with people
02:28:44.36 --> 02:28:45.40 I mean
02:28:45.40 --> 02:28:48.28 Look there's some people that don't want to interact with other humans
02:28:48.84 --> 02:28:51.72 Yeah leadership is something they don't even want to do
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.16 They just want to be in charge of like their computer screen. Yeah, that's cool
02:28:57.16 --> 02:29:06.20 So yeah, and the money part of things is a real easy one to kind of gravitate to as far as your attention and like maybe a lot of time
02:29:06.20 --> 02:29:13.000 Your value system because like like obviously guys like Matt where that's they're interested in that part of things
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.52 You know the fine he wanted to be an investment banker and you know that's not like a rare thing
02:29:18.52 --> 02:29:20.92 And nothing necessarily but bro. I'll tell you right now
02:29:21.56 --> 02:29:22.92 I never even
02:29:22.92 --> 02:29:24.92 Consider thinking about
02:29:24.92 --> 02:29:28.44 Even that whole industry and I'm sure a lot of people like that too
02:29:28.44 --> 02:29:31.88 So like hey, what do you want to be when you grow up investment bankers not part of that thing?
02:29:32.84 --> 02:29:34.92 But investment banking is in or
02:29:35.32 --> 02:29:43.80 What's involved in investment banking is a very specific type of thing that people like Matt are great like that's part of their interests like man
02:29:43.80 --> 02:29:45.80 It has to do with something like that
02:29:46.60 --> 02:29:49.64 So when you see the results of a successful
02:29:50.52 --> 02:29:54.12 Guy who's into that kind of stuff. It's easy to be like oh, yeah
02:29:54.12 --> 02:29:57.56 He's winning a bigger quote unquote bigger game than me
02:29:58.28 --> 02:30:02.92 But I feel like the bigger game that I'm talking about is the game that's like
02:30:03.96 --> 02:30:06.60 Like if you were to structure your life then
02:30:07.40 --> 02:30:11.72 What do you say what do you do this scale that's when you guys use right business guys
02:30:12.52 --> 02:30:16.68 Scale it it's like you can make this right but to scale it means you're above
02:30:16.68 --> 02:30:22.36 Maybe 10 people making that same thing 10 times the amount right and you scale it a lot of times
02:30:22.36 --> 02:30:24.36 That scale game
02:30:25.72 --> 02:30:31.56 That's the part we all miss but investment banking is kind of like it's part of it anyway
02:30:31.56 --> 02:30:33.72 Even what I understand which is not that much
02:30:34.84 --> 02:30:44.04 Part of what would drive maybe interest in that industry is the same stuff that's gonna draw your interest towards things like being able to scale xy
02:30:44.04 --> 02:30:49.32 Thing because the interest isn't on the xy's thing. It's about the scaling part of it. You see me. Yeah
02:30:49.32 --> 02:30:55.64 Yeah, it's good stuff. It is interesting. Well, what I was gonna say is that
02:30:57.32 --> 02:30:59.32 the also
02:30:59.32 --> 02:31:01.32 Like for instance
02:31:01.16 --> 02:31:02.12 at
02:31:02.12 --> 02:31:06.68 Origin right we're making jeans we could make more money making jeans in China
02:31:07.40 --> 02:31:11.80 Right so we could we could allegedly win a certain part of the game
02:31:11.80 --> 02:31:15.80 But we're playing by other rules and we're not winning the game that we want to win
02:31:15.80 --> 02:31:18.20 We want to win the game bring it back. I'm American media factory
02:31:18.20 --> 02:31:19.80 So you got it
02:31:20.04 --> 02:31:24.92 It's not it's quite so cut and dry and the other thing I was thinking about when you just talk about raw money
02:31:25.96 --> 02:31:30.28 What are people gonna use that money for a lot if you think about like an end-game?
02:31:30.52 --> 02:31:34.68 Is you're gonna use that money to buy time? Oh, now I don't have to work anymore. I can do whatever I want
02:31:35.08 --> 02:31:39.000 Well, how much how much time did you invest in a getting the money so that you could buy time?
02:31:39.56 --> 02:31:40.84 So you got to run that game
02:31:40.84 --> 02:31:45.88 Get around those numbers in your head because if you're investing all your time into into make money
02:31:45.88 --> 02:31:49.56 So that you can buy your time back you might be losing you know
02:31:50.04 --> 02:31:54.52 Unless you figure out a way to scale it which is what you were just talking about unless you figured out a way to scale it
02:31:54.52 --> 02:32:00.84 You're gonna have a hard time doing that so that's why it's important in my opinion to be doing something that you really love doing
02:32:01.40 --> 02:32:04.92 You know, I never even ever thought I was working in
02:32:05.48 --> 02:32:07.88 While I was in the Navy probably let me rephrase up
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.88 I was very seldom considering what I was doing work
02:32:12.76 --> 02:32:14.76 Just didn't seem like work ever
02:32:14.76 --> 02:32:22.68 Like just didn't seem like work so that's a really good life. You know, I had I didn't need money to buy time because I had all the time in the world
02:32:22.68 --> 02:32:26.44 Because I was doing exactly what I wanted to all the time. Yeah, that makes sense. So
02:32:28.04 --> 02:32:30.04 So that's good stuff. All right
02:32:30.60 --> 02:32:32.60 Hey, if you want to
02:32:33.40 --> 02:32:35.40 Invest in your health
02:32:35.40 --> 02:32:43.000 Get yourself some stuff some healthy things to put your body. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you noticed you know what we offered Matt
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.28 some
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:53.72 Go yeah, what flavor he chose. Yeah, I am a clean energy champion. Oh, that's just muted. That's right. Factually. Yeah, you know
02:32:54.04 --> 02:32:57.96 It's a good deal either way. We did notice Matt chose it and you know, it is what it is
