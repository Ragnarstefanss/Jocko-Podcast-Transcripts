00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.56
This is Jocco podcast number 27 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willing.

2
00:00:13.56 --> 00:00:23.12
I knew a simple soldier boy who grinned a life in empty joy, slept soundly through the

3
00:00:23.12 --> 00:00:30.16
lonesome dark and whistled early with the dark.

4
00:00:30.16 --> 00:00:42.56
In winter trenches, cowed and glum with crumps and lice and lack of rum, he put a bullet

5
00:00:42.56 --> 00:00:51.44
through his brain, no one spoke of him again.

6
00:00:51.44 --> 00:00:59.88
You smug faced crowd with kindling eye, who cheer when soldier lads march by, sneak home

7
00:00:59.88 --> 00:01:12.84
and pray you'll never know the hell where youth and laughter go.

8
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:26.44
It's a poem called suicide in the trenches by sick freed Sassoon.

9
00:01:26.44 --> 00:01:32.16
Good evening echo.

10
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:56.48
The sick freed Sassoon was decorated for extreme bravery.

11
00:01:56.48 --> 00:02:00.28
The gidci gile, he was severely injured.

12
00:02:00.28 --> 00:02:11.96
was eventually sent to a hospital to try and recover mentally from what he'd been through

13
00:02:11.96 --> 00:02:21.24
while he was there, he wrote a little letter that was called finished with the war, soldiers

14
00:02:21.24 --> 00:02:25.52
declaration.

15
00:02:25.52 --> 00:02:33.96
Here he came out and said, we got to stop fighting the war like this.

16
00:02:33.96 --> 00:02:42.88
I'm speaking for the men that are on the front lines in the trenches being killed.

17
00:02:42.88 --> 00:02:50.04
And even after that he was promoted.

18
00:02:50.04 --> 00:02:55.40
He returned to the front again.

19
00:02:55.40 --> 00:03:04.76
He was wounded this time by friendly fire.

20
00:03:04.76 --> 00:03:08.80
That's World War I.

21
00:03:08.80 --> 00:03:16.48
And while Sigfried Sassun tells us to pray we will never know the hell where youth and laughter

22
00:03:16.48 --> 00:03:24.52
go, I do not agree with that.

23
00:03:24.52 --> 00:03:37.16
I want to know when I want everyone to know and understand and to see the hell, the darkness

24
00:03:37.16 --> 00:03:44.16
that crushes youth and laughter.

25
00:03:44.16 --> 00:03:50.92
And taking us on this voyage into darkness tonight is a man by the name of Bob Hoffman.

26
00:03:50.92 --> 00:03:56.64
If you look him up, you'll see he's a very accomplished man.

27
00:03:56.64 --> 00:04:01.04
He was obsessed with health and fitness and he became a businessman.

28
00:04:01.04 --> 00:04:05.44
He was the one that founders at the York Barbell corporation.

29
00:04:05.44 --> 00:04:12.24
If you ever lifted weights in your life, you've used York Barbells at some time.

30
00:04:12.24 --> 00:04:16.08
He's often called the father of modern weightlifting.

31
00:04:16.08 --> 00:04:25.84
But interestingly, what you won't find much about him is his military service.

32
00:04:25.84 --> 00:04:32.40
You don't see generally that he was awarded the distinguished service cross, the silver

33
00:04:32.40 --> 00:04:38.60
star, the purple heart, the French cross of war, the French military medal, the Italian

34
00:04:38.60 --> 00:04:48.84
war cross and the highest Belgian military award the Order of Leopold.

35
00:04:48.84 --> 00:04:53.04
You just don't hear that about him.

36
00:04:53.04 --> 00:04:57.72
But that was a piece of his life.

37
00:04:57.72 --> 00:04:59.88
And he did write about it.

38
00:04:59.88 --> 00:05:07.92
You wrote about it in a book which is called, I remember the last war.

39
00:05:07.92 --> 00:05:11.20
Let's go to the book.

40
00:05:11.20 --> 00:05:15.56
Few people have been able to learn much about what actually took place in the front

41
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:19.76
line fighting of the World War.

42
00:05:19.76 --> 00:05:24.64
They have often asked about the war and have found few veterans who could talk about it.

43
00:05:24.64 --> 00:05:30.28
One of the chief reasons for this is that they had little or nothing to tell about the

44
00:05:30.28 --> 00:05:31.84
war.

45
00:05:31.84 --> 00:05:35.48
Approximately 4 million men were in service during the war.

46
00:05:35.48 --> 00:05:41.08
Most of these went to France and of these half a million were near the front.

47
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:46.36
Ten men are required behind the front to keep one man in action.

48
00:05:46.36 --> 00:05:51.44
Service supply, truck drivers, hospital workers, ambulance drivers, guards in the base

49
00:05:51.44 --> 00:05:54.72
ports that are replacement in casualty camps.

50
00:05:54.72 --> 00:06:00.40
Many thousands of military police artillery engineers, singlemen, aviators, mechanics,

51
00:06:00.40 --> 00:06:03.28
and endless more.

52
00:06:03.28 --> 00:06:08.56
Our division lost more men than any other former national guard division, more men than

53
00:06:08.56 --> 00:06:13.16
any other organization except the first and second regular divisions.

54
00:06:13.16 --> 00:06:18.44
Our regiment lost more men than any other regiment or our division, our battalion more

55
00:06:18.44 --> 00:06:23.72
men of any of the three battalions in our regiment and our company more men than any other

56
00:06:23.72 --> 00:06:26.40
company in the battalion.

57
00:06:26.40 --> 00:06:31.04
Yet we had men who never saw a German who was not a prisoner.

58
00:06:31.04 --> 00:06:36.20
Some of our men were cooks, top sergeants, company clerk, supply sergeants, buglers,

59
00:06:36.20 --> 00:06:38.000
signaling, kitchen police.

60
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.90
The men who carried up the ammunition, the rations, cared for the wounded and advanced

61
00:06:41.90 --> 00:06:49.48
stations, buried the dead, many were liaison men carrying messages from company to battalion.

62
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:56.16
They fired and were fired at as we fought in towns, woods and hills but seldom saw targets

63
00:06:56.16 --> 00:06:58.44
at which they fired.

64
00:06:58.44 --> 00:07:04.96
Men and shells were dropped on them, they suffered from gas and most of the horrors of war.

65
00:07:04.96 --> 00:07:10.68
They were killed but they weren't actually at the front.

66
00:07:10.68 --> 00:07:17.20
Men who were trained as I was, scouting, patrolling, observation, sniping, who led patrols,

67
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:22.68
reconnaissance, or combat, advanced guards, captured prisoners, put a gun out of action,

68
00:07:22.68 --> 00:07:27.68
held advanced posts, served as suicide squads and we were being attacked.

69
00:07:27.68 --> 00:07:34.80
And the men who actually saw war and most of them are dead.

70
00:07:34.80 --> 00:07:40.68
While 125,000 American dead in France are not so many when divided among the million men

71
00:07:40.68 --> 00:07:45.24
who were at or near the front, it is a tremendous percentage when it is considered how

72
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:49.16
few of these men were doing the fighting.

73
00:07:49.16 --> 00:07:54.44
More than 250 men in our company alone were killed.

74
00:07:54.44 --> 00:07:59.76
More than the original strength of the company lost their lives in France, they can't

75
00:07:59.76 --> 00:08:03.08
tell you the story.

76
00:08:03.08 --> 00:08:08.20
I was phenomenally lucky, so I will tell our story.

77
00:08:08.20 --> 00:08:12.20
We'll try to tell you something of what happened over there.

78
00:08:12.20 --> 00:08:17.40
There have been war books written by other men who were better writers than I, more fitted

79
00:08:17.40 --> 00:08:21.36
to place what they saw upon the printed page.

80
00:08:21.36 --> 00:08:25.84
But I don't believe a book about America's participation in the war has been written by a man

81
00:08:25.84 --> 00:08:33.12
who spent days, weeks, and months in intensive fighting at or in front of the front as my

82
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:36.96
comrades and I did.

83
00:08:36.96 --> 00:08:43.68
There is nothing particularly glorious or beautiful about this story.

84
00:08:43.68 --> 00:08:48.72
I've told it as well as I could, but have been able to give you only a faint idea of the

85
00:08:48.72 --> 00:08:55.72
conditions we encountered during the five worst days of any unit of the American Army experience

86
00:08:55.72 --> 00:08:57.56
in France.

87
00:08:57.56 --> 00:09:05.56
The five days of our battle of Fismet, you could fully appreciate its horrors only if you

88
00:09:05.56 --> 00:09:08.08
were there.

89
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:13.20
Never was a group of men harder pressed by superior forces of the enemy or more ill

90
00:09:13.20 --> 00:09:18.64
equipped to fight off those attacks than we.

91
00:09:18.64 --> 00:09:24.32
No artillery support during most of the fighting, no trench mortars, no hand or rifleed

92
00:09:24.32 --> 00:09:30.44
grenades, just a moderate amount of pistol, rifle, and machine gun ammunition.

93
00:09:30.44 --> 00:09:36.84
No food, proper medical attention, or the opportunity to bury the dead.

94
00:09:36.84 --> 00:09:44.24
Our men in that battle, the handful who held the front lines, covered themselves with undying

95
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:46.88
glory.

96
00:09:46.88 --> 00:09:51.28
The telling of this story will give a better idea of what we did in France and other books

97
00:09:51.28 --> 00:09:54.20
than other war books I've seen.

98
00:09:54.20 --> 00:10:05.60
It tells the unvarnished truth about how we lived, slept, hiked, fought, and died over there.

99
00:10:05.60 --> 00:10:13.36
Wars of my friends, the men I lived with, trained with, fought with, had come to like

100
00:10:13.36 --> 00:10:17.84
and admire, died in the woods in France.

101
00:10:17.84 --> 00:10:24.32
It was only by a series of miracles, amazing escapes that I did not die to.

102
00:10:24.32 --> 00:10:27.76
That I am here writing this book.

103
00:10:27.76 --> 00:10:34.64
I was young then, 19 years of age at the time of the battle of the Argonne.

104
00:10:34.64 --> 00:10:39.60
I had been too busy to live, and because I had not found what a fine place the world

105
00:10:39.60 --> 00:10:45.48
can be, I did not mind particularly dying.

106
00:10:45.48 --> 00:10:49.64
I had no actual fear of death.

107
00:10:49.64 --> 00:10:57.20
21 years ago, when we fought the battle of the Argonne, I had 32 ugly blood boils on my body

108
00:10:57.20 --> 00:11:02.04
from eating a diet consisting mostly of meat and bread for some weeks.

109
00:11:02.04 --> 00:11:06.56
I had no real skills which made me swear more than I have all the rest of my life, as I constantly

110
00:11:06.56 --> 00:11:12.60
scraped them on the rocky ground while digging a new hole to protect my body each time we

111
00:11:12.60 --> 00:11:15.16
halted.

112
00:11:15.16 --> 00:11:24.44
I had French itch and copious quantities of mustard gas, ugly burns which still leave their scars.

113
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:31.40
12 bullets left their mark on my person, or on my equipment, in the first short battle.

114
00:11:31.40 --> 00:11:40.12
I was one of 32 men of our 250 strength company who marched out of the battle of Fizme.

115
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:46.12
I was the only man to return of those who followed me on five patrols that I led in one

116
00:11:46.12 --> 00:11:51.24
day in the Argonne forest.

117
00:11:51.24 --> 00:11:56.88
I hope through this book, at least partially to show the gruesome side of war, barred from

118
00:11:56.88 --> 00:12:06.48
the waving of flags, the bugles, bands that cheering to show at least part of the ugliness,

119
00:12:06.48 --> 00:12:15.28
filth, dirt, evil, immorality and stink of war.

120
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:18.80
Be sympathetic but remain aloof.

121
00:12:18.80 --> 00:12:23.000
Be strong prepared to protect our own country against any nation or combination of

122
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.20
nations which may attack our homes, our democracy, our American way of living.

123
00:12:29.20 --> 00:12:34.68
If our country was attacked the first hour would not pass before I would plan to enlist.

124
00:12:34.68 --> 00:12:39.28
And millions of other Americans would be in just as much haste to protect our wonderful

125
00:12:39.28 --> 00:12:44.40
country and our American way of life.

126
00:12:44.40 --> 00:12:54.56
So that's how he kicks this book off, kind of burning through the intro there.

127
00:12:54.56 --> 00:13:00.56
I really liked the point that he made when he broke down the numbers and how many people

128
00:13:00.56 --> 00:13:05.000
go to war but how many people are actually fighting.

129
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.92
And it's a big discrepancy.

130
00:13:06.92 --> 00:13:11.16
It takes a lot of people to get bullets to the guy on the front line.

131
00:13:11.16 --> 00:13:15.04
It takes a lot of people to get that person transported to the front line.

132
00:13:15.04 --> 00:13:18.04
It takes a lot of people to get to keep that person fed.

133
00:13:18.04 --> 00:13:21.12
It takes all kinds of logistics and support.

134
00:13:21.12 --> 00:13:27.48
Just to get that guy through the door of a building where the enemy is.

135
00:13:27.48 --> 00:13:29.68
And I've talked about this before too.

136
00:13:29.68 --> 00:13:36.72
In Iraq there was places in Iraq where there was bases in Iraq where it was basically

137
00:13:36.72 --> 00:13:43.52
like being in America they had restaurants and Starbucks coffee and McDonald's and Burger King.

138
00:13:43.52 --> 00:13:47.96
And they had pools and movie theaters.

139
00:13:47.96 --> 00:13:49.84
I mean it was crazy.

140
00:13:49.84 --> 00:13:53.04
Is it where like how you mentioned like Burger King for example?

141
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:57.20
Do they disburger King the company kind of make a deal with you know the government

142
00:13:57.20 --> 00:13:59.20
be like hey we want to fly Burger King.

143
00:13:59.20 --> 00:14:02.60
Yes I'm sure and actually I shouldn't have said McDonald's it was usually Burger King.

144
00:14:02.60 --> 00:14:05.36
They must have be the ones that had the deal at the time.

145
00:14:05.36 --> 00:14:13.04
So Burger King was there on base and you would travel out stations where there's some

146
00:14:13.04 --> 00:14:15.98
army unit this is on my first appointment travel to some out station where there's some

147
00:14:15.98 --> 00:14:20.88
army unit living out middle of nowhere just totally desolate.

148
00:14:20.88 --> 00:14:23.92
Some Marine Corps unit living in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:14:23.92 --> 00:14:27.28
Eat and MREs every day and like there was a group we worked with one.

150
00:14:27.28 --> 00:14:30.60
I was like remember where they were to give them some credit.

151
00:14:30.60 --> 00:14:34.40
But they were out there there on one MRE a day which MREs meals ready to eat.

152
00:14:34.40 --> 00:14:39.64
And it's not a very good thing to live off of.

153
00:14:39.64 --> 00:14:43.32
And these guys were out there living off of one MRE a day.

154
00:14:43.32 --> 00:14:45.28
And you feel bad you know you go out we stopped that.

155
00:14:45.28 --> 00:14:48.52
I think we had to stop their base where to get some information to gather some intel.

156
00:14:48.52 --> 00:14:52.56
They knew some targets around the area we went and talked to them saw how rough they were

157
00:14:52.56 --> 00:14:53.56
living.

158
00:14:53.56 --> 00:14:56.32
We went out and hit our targets then we were driving back to our big base you know where

159
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:02.52
we had good food and you know internet stuff like that.

160
00:15:02.52 --> 00:15:06.64
I mean it's it's amazing how good it can be.

161
00:15:06.64 --> 00:15:11.36
And that's what that's what people don't realize about the military is it takes a lot

162
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:15.64
of support and logistics to keep the guys on the front lines on the front lines.

163
00:15:15.64 --> 00:15:18.72
And not taking anything away from those folks that are doing that because that's a hard

164
00:15:18.72 --> 00:15:21.84
job and I've talked about this before those logistics convoys.

165
00:15:21.84 --> 00:15:29.72
You know Iraq and Afghanistan those things were hard corn horrible dangerous jobs to do.

166
00:15:29.72 --> 00:15:34.48
And so I'm not taking anything away but if you want to say okay who went out and hunted

167
00:15:34.48 --> 00:15:40.44
down the enemy and got him it's a much, much smaller group of people.

168
00:15:40.44 --> 00:15:41.44
Right.

169
00:15:41.44 --> 00:15:45.68
So it's like individually yeah you got people who did that part of it but collectively

170
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:47.64
it's just this huge force.

171
00:15:47.64 --> 00:15:48.64
Right.

172
00:15:48.64 --> 00:15:49.64
Of people.

173
00:15:49.64 --> 00:15:56.32
Yeah it's a massive it's a massive force but and it's even more extreme because in World War

174
00:15:56.32 --> 00:16:00.12
war the lines were very clearly drawn.

175
00:16:00.12 --> 00:16:03.44
I mean you had literally had trenches during the ground.

176
00:16:03.44 --> 00:16:07.96
And so if you weren't within range of the of the enemy attacks I mean maybe they get

177
00:16:07.96 --> 00:16:11.72
some planes to you but you would do be living relatively safe and that's his point.

178
00:16:11.72 --> 00:16:14.20
And then when you get a little closer to the front lines yeah you're going to get some

179
00:16:14.20 --> 00:16:18.40
artillery bombardment but everyone had dug these nice holes in these trenches.

180
00:16:18.40 --> 00:16:24.60
So the guys that were actually invading German trenches.

181
00:16:24.60 --> 00:16:27.04
Most of them are dead most of them are dead.

182
00:16:27.04 --> 00:16:32.84
It's a small much it's one out of every ten soldiers that was actually going forward to

183
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:35.88
attack and most of them are dead.

184
00:16:35.88 --> 00:16:39.52
I mean you could hear what he just said they took more casualties than the strength of

185
00:16:39.52 --> 00:16:41.64
their of their company was.

186
00:16:41.64 --> 00:16:45.36
So they had 250 guys there was actually a thousand guys in the company because they took

187
00:16:45.36 --> 00:16:48.52
so many casualties.

188
00:16:48.52 --> 00:16:54.56
That's why World War one is so horribly disturbing and scary to me because like I've

189
00:16:54.56 --> 00:16:56.80
said before there was an attack.

190
00:16:56.80 --> 00:17:01.000
Your your own tactical prowess one gonna help you.

191
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.56
Your your own personal skill set wasn't really gonna help you.

192
00:17:06.56 --> 00:17:10.40
You were gonna get up you were gonna charge and and really Bob Hoffman talks about this

193
00:17:10.40 --> 00:17:11.72
and he was just lucky.

194
00:17:11.72 --> 00:17:15.88
He was a great athlete and he trained hard and he was constantly trying to make himself

195
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:16.88
better.

196
00:17:16.88 --> 00:17:21.96
I'm sure that contributed to it all somewhat but hey when you when he comes off the battlefield

197
00:17:21.96 --> 00:17:26.72
and he'd been shot 13 times a month you know in the knees his bullet holes in his

198
00:17:26.72 --> 00:17:30.08
canteens he'd been just just that's just miracle.

199
00:17:30.08 --> 00:17:34.92
You know look down.

200
00:17:34.92 --> 00:17:43.20
So going back to the book he says we should bend all our efforts toward becoming so strong

201
00:17:43.20 --> 00:17:49.52
that no other nation or coalition of nations will dare to attack us.

202
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.80
We should build the physical strength of our manhood and womanhood, our mechanical equipment,

203
00:17:55.80 --> 00:18:01.48
our navy in particular and our army so that we can resist any form of invasion in the

204
00:18:01.48 --> 00:18:04.52
future.

205
00:18:04.52 --> 00:18:08.70
And I put that in there because you're gonna see a pretty common theme in the way this

206
00:18:08.70 --> 00:18:13.96
guy lived his life which was to be stronger, faster, better, smarter, always trying to improve

207
00:18:13.96 --> 00:18:18.92
himself, always trying to be the best Bob Hoffman that he could be and obviously that's

208
00:18:18.92 --> 00:18:26.04
how he ended up running a giant you know organization for weightlifting and fitness.

209
00:18:26.04 --> 00:18:29.56
And he actually took some heat for the way he lived sometimes.

210
00:18:29.56 --> 00:18:36.92
And here they were on on a ship heading overseas, heading to France or to England and

211
00:18:36.92 --> 00:18:43.36
he's talking about what it was like for him being a guy that believes in being strong

212
00:18:43.36 --> 00:18:47.56
and healthy and smarter and trying to improve himself.

213
00:18:47.56 --> 00:18:49.80
Here we go back to the book.

214
00:18:49.80 --> 00:18:52.92
All sorts of men make up an army.

215
00:18:52.92 --> 00:18:55.60
Good, bad and indifferent.

216
00:18:55.60 --> 00:19:01.88
I found myself in lots of trouble for I had been fond of study, athletics and work went

217
00:19:01.88 --> 00:19:02.88
home.

218
00:19:02.88 --> 00:19:09.56
I didn't smoke, drink, chew, gamble or go out with questionable women or indulging other

219
00:19:09.56 --> 00:19:14.16
diversions that some consider to be manly.

220
00:19:14.16 --> 00:19:19.68
There were men who thought that I was a scissi because I did not have manly habits.

221
00:19:19.68 --> 00:19:24.88
This led to a great many fights and I thought at one time I would have to beat every man

222
00:19:24.88 --> 00:19:29.76
in the company individually to prove that I wasn't a scissi.

223
00:19:29.76 --> 00:19:34.76
I did get enough practice that later enabled me to win the boxing championship in my body

224
00:19:34.76 --> 00:19:37.76
weight class of our division.

225
00:19:37.76 --> 00:19:45.16
This experience served me well on the Atlantic crossing for I fought five, three round fights in one day.

226
00:19:45.16 --> 00:19:52.16
Someone had to do it and the job fell on me.

227
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:55.92
He was getting, you know, for lack of a better word, picked on because he was a good

228
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:57.48
he to use.

229
00:19:57.48 --> 00:20:02.84
The only way he was able to stand up for himself was just to get his scrap on.

230
00:20:02.84 --> 00:20:03.84
Get his fight on.

231
00:20:03.84 --> 00:20:05.84
He was a straight edge.

232
00:20:05.84 --> 00:20:10.40
He was a, he was an early day straight edge guy.

233
00:20:10.40 --> 00:20:15.88
Yeah, I don't think he had the straight edge music going into his head yet.

234
00:20:15.88 --> 00:20:19.52
That might help him out.

235
00:20:19.52 --> 00:20:25.68
So they get overseas and now I'm taking you straight into it, into them, getting him

236
00:20:25.68 --> 00:20:31.16
getting tasked with with their first mission.

237
00:20:31.16 --> 00:20:37.36
And here we go, was I thrilled the front at last when asked by our captain if I wanted

238
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:38.36
to go with the platoon.

239
00:20:38.36 --> 00:20:40.08
I said, do I want to go?

240
00:20:40.08 --> 00:20:44.04
That's what I've been yearning and aching for all these months.

241
00:20:44.04 --> 00:20:48.76
When I was just a youngster, I would read books telling how anxious soldiers were to go into

242
00:20:48.76 --> 00:20:50.08
action.

243
00:20:50.08 --> 00:20:55.96
I couldn't understand how men could desire to go out and fight and die.

244
00:20:55.96 --> 00:20:58.92
But it is something that grows on you.

245
00:20:58.92 --> 00:21:05.10
You train and expect so long that finally you become anxious to get into it, to get it

246
00:21:05.10 --> 00:21:07.10
over with.

247
00:21:07.10 --> 00:21:08.76
Time was short.

248
00:21:08.76 --> 00:21:11.72
We went back to our companies on the run.

249
00:21:11.72 --> 00:21:16.60
Our company was assembled and I briefly explained that a platoon of 58 men was to be

250
00:21:16.60 --> 00:21:22.88
selected and that we were to make an attack with the French at six o'clock that night.

251
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:27.28
My words felt like a bombshell, a brief cheer went up from our company.

252
00:21:27.28 --> 00:21:34.20
I asked all the men who wanted to be first in action to step forward and like one man, the

253
00:21:34.20 --> 00:21:37.64
entire company stepped forward.

254
00:21:37.64 --> 00:21:44.40
Men who did not get to go on this trip cried real tears, a direct contrast to the lack

255
00:21:44.40 --> 00:21:50.64
of volunteering for dangerous missions a few months later when they had become war weary.

256
00:21:50.64 --> 00:21:55.60
Then they would go, if assigned to any task, no matter how dangerous, but they did not

257
00:21:55.60 --> 00:21:57.24
rush in.

258
00:21:57.24 --> 00:22:01.88
They became fatalists and said they'd go if they were chosen.

259
00:22:01.88 --> 00:22:11.76
They die if it was their turn, but they weren't going to overwork fate.

260
00:22:11.76 --> 00:22:20.16
And if you, that's to perfect comparison to the story that I tell in my retirement speech,

261
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:24.48
where we had this horrible situation going on in eastern Ramadi and I basically said,

262
00:22:24.48 --> 00:22:28.64
all right, whoever wants to go and live in this warst area, put your name up on that board

263
00:22:28.64 --> 00:22:31.28
and every guy put their name up on that board.

264
00:22:31.28 --> 00:22:35.40
And I'll tell you, this is also accurate in the fact that you fast forward two or three

265
00:22:35.40 --> 00:22:39.88
months into deployment after we take in casualties, after market being killed.

266
00:22:39.88 --> 00:22:45.28
And all of a sudden, guys, we're not, and I'll use the exact quote he uses here.

267
00:22:45.28 --> 00:22:53.80
They'd go to any task assigned no matter how dangerous, but they did not rush in.

268
00:22:53.80 --> 00:22:57.08
We came war weary and that happens to anybody.

269
00:22:57.08 --> 00:22:59.40
Then I even saw that on my first deployment to Iraq.

270
00:22:59.40 --> 00:23:04.04
We first got up into Baghdad, everybody wants to go on every mission, everyone's all fired

271
00:23:04.04 --> 00:23:07.60
up, but his time goes by.

272
00:23:07.60 --> 00:23:09.80
You start saying, what do we do in this mission for?

273
00:23:09.80 --> 00:23:11.52
What's this mission about?

274
00:23:11.52 --> 00:23:13.52
Who are we going after?

275
00:23:13.52 --> 00:23:17.36
Fear starts to creep in.

276
00:23:17.36 --> 00:23:20.80
Now let's get to the assault.

277
00:23:20.80 --> 00:23:24.44
The French men were working like mad with their trench mortars.

278
00:23:24.44 --> 00:23:26.96
They kept shells continuously in the air.

279
00:23:26.96 --> 00:23:32.68
At three minutes to six, Sergeant Felix walked along the parapet informing all our men

280
00:23:32.68 --> 00:23:35.48
that we were going over in a few moments.

281
00:23:35.48 --> 00:23:41.64
I urged him to keep down not to make a target of himself, but he disregarded my advice.

282
00:23:41.64 --> 00:23:46.96
Finally, as our watches, which had been synchronized before the bombardment, pointed exactly

283
00:23:46.96 --> 00:23:52.60
to six o'clock, there were whistles and commands and climbing men leaving the trench all

284
00:23:52.60 --> 00:23:54.52
along the line.

285
00:23:54.52 --> 00:23:58.000
The gunners who had been working so desperately with the trench mortars to pave the way

286
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.08
for us cheered and cried out to us, evidently urging us to sweep the Germans from the hill.

287
00:24:04.08 --> 00:24:07.52
I just couldn't understand what they said.

288
00:24:07.52 --> 00:24:13.32
In soon, we were in the thick of things, bullets flying merely by this time from the German

289
00:24:13.32 --> 00:24:14.32
trenches.

290
00:24:14.32 --> 00:24:19.24
Perhaps a fourth of a mile away, I was hardly out of the trench until some great force

291
00:24:19.24 --> 00:24:24.32
pushed me, knocking me over for a distance of perhaps 20 feet.

292
00:24:24.32 --> 00:24:29.44
I didn't know what it hit me, but I felt blood running down my right eye.

293
00:24:29.44 --> 00:24:34.72
After that knock down, I forgot the line of combat groups, and we fought just as our

294
00:24:34.72 --> 00:24:38.56
ancestor's head always fought.

295
00:24:38.56 --> 00:24:45.84
An instinctive rushing forward, stopping to shoot, rushing again, and shooting again.

296
00:24:45.84 --> 00:24:48.12
That's your welcome to combat.

297
00:24:48.12 --> 00:24:50.72
Oh, you're all fired up.

298
00:24:50.72 --> 00:24:51.96
You ready to go get some?

299
00:24:51.96 --> 00:24:53.52
Cool, go over the top.

300
00:24:53.52 --> 00:24:56.32
The first thing that happens to you is you get shot, which is what happened to him.

301
00:24:56.32 --> 00:24:59.24
He doesn't even know it yet.

302
00:24:59.24 --> 00:25:05.68
All Americans have a legacy which has come to them from courageous fighting, pioneer,

303
00:25:05.68 --> 00:25:07.20
ancestors.

304
00:25:07.20 --> 00:25:10.72
The American soldier is a good soldier.

305
00:25:10.72 --> 00:25:15.72
He has not had the centuries of drilling to make his own individual self subservient

306
00:25:15.72 --> 00:25:18.60
to the will of the commanding officer.

307
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:23.56
He does not like to salute the brass bar, unless that lieutenant has won his respect

308
00:25:23.56 --> 00:25:25.52
through deeds.

309
00:25:25.52 --> 00:25:29.52
He does not like to be regimented, turned into a mere robot.

310
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:32.64
He can think and act for himself.

311
00:25:32.64 --> 00:25:40.40
And when a battle has passed the initial stages, he's the best soldier in the world.

312
00:25:40.40 --> 00:25:46.000
This is going, again, reminder, this is World War I.

313
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.32
And I say this all the time, people in the military are not robots.

314
00:25:53.32 --> 00:25:59.000
I can't speak too much about people from other militarys, but clearly this was a standout

315
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.64
fought as an American looking at American troops in combat.

316
00:26:03.64 --> 00:26:06.04
They're not just robots.

317
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:11.96
And one of the best things about them is that they can think.

318
00:26:11.96 --> 00:26:19.88
Now here come a bunch of Americans over on some Germans coming up on their trench.

319
00:26:19.88 --> 00:26:24.76
Perhaps the Germans were too startled at the size and evident ferrocity of their antagonists

320
00:26:24.76 --> 00:26:27.12
to fight well for a minute.

321
00:26:27.12 --> 00:26:34.44
And it seemed like a group of big men who had met a lot of boys playing soldiers.

322
00:26:34.44 --> 00:26:39.44
One push and the Germans rifle was knocked from his hand, a long thrust and that unfortunate

323
00:26:39.44 --> 00:26:42.24
man had reached the end of his life.

324
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:44.64
I can still see the faces of these men.

325
00:26:44.64 --> 00:26:46.08
They're evident terror.

326
00:26:46.08 --> 00:26:51.16
They're astonishment at the number of men who leaped at them from the grass, at the size

327
00:26:51.16 --> 00:26:52.92
and power of these men.

328
00:26:52.92 --> 00:26:55.92
They're evident helplessness.

329
00:26:55.92 --> 00:26:59.16
There was not time for them to surrender.

330
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:03.60
They had jumped up with bayonet and rifles in a moment or two.

331
00:27:03.60 --> 00:27:06.44
It was all over.

332
00:27:06.44 --> 00:27:07.80
Now this continues.

333
00:27:07.80 --> 00:27:10.80
Our advanced troops had passed me by.

334
00:27:10.80 --> 00:27:13.52
I could see dead Germans laying here and there.

335
00:27:13.52 --> 00:27:15.76
Right near me were two of them close together.

336
00:27:15.76 --> 00:27:19.56
One of them was a big older man with a Prussian mustache.

337
00:27:19.56 --> 00:27:24.88
His hand still clashed with the point in his stomach where the bayonet had gone in and

338
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:26.84
been withdrawn.

339
00:27:26.84 --> 00:27:32.20
The youngster lay all twisted up he too had been bayonetted and it seemed that his bones

340
00:27:32.20 --> 00:27:36.12
were broken from the strokes of the buttovile rifle.

341
00:27:36.12 --> 00:27:41.64
A rifle is a wicked weapon when swung by a powerful man and there were many strong men

342
00:27:41.64 --> 00:27:47.44
in action that day.

343
00:27:47.44 --> 00:27:56.06
You hear about bayonet fighting, but to think about it on this scale where this is

344
00:27:56.06 --> 00:28:00.36
looking more like a scene out of brave heart at this point than it is looking like a modern

345
00:28:00.36 --> 00:28:01.36
war.

346
00:28:01.36 --> 00:28:11.32
People clubbing each other to death and stabbing each other at bayonet range.

347
00:28:11.32 --> 00:28:15.52
The Germans weren't giving out giving up without a real struggle.

348
00:28:15.52 --> 00:28:21.40
We had read a lot about chained machine gunners, but these men weren't chained and they

349
00:28:21.40 --> 00:28:23.56
were fighting to the bidder death.

350
00:28:23.56 --> 00:28:28.28
Now that chained machine gunners is like a rumor that happened that the Americans would

351
00:28:28.28 --> 00:28:34.40
hear because the Germans had a machine gun and it was a big heavy sort of a medium weight

352
00:28:34.40 --> 00:28:36.08
heavy weight machine gun.

353
00:28:36.08 --> 00:28:42.76
I think it was a MG08 and it was so heavy that they put this big sling on it.

354
00:28:42.76 --> 00:28:47.84
On the sling it was made a leather but they had to reinforce the leather with chained.

355
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:53.68
So when they would find these soldiers dead with these machine guns and the chained would

356
00:28:53.68 --> 00:28:58.68
clip into their gear, the rumor was that these guys had just been chained to their machine

357
00:28:58.68 --> 00:28:59.68
guns.

358
00:28:59.68 --> 00:29:00.68
You can't leave.

359
00:29:00.68 --> 00:29:05.56
You're just going to stay here and fight to the death.

360
00:29:05.56 --> 00:29:07.12
Our men were back to the book.

361
00:29:07.12 --> 00:29:09.72
Our men were constantly rising and falling.

362
00:29:09.72 --> 00:29:11.92
Some of them never to rise again.

363
00:29:11.92 --> 00:29:16.28
Our ranks were becoming rapidly decimated and there were a few of us still going forward

364
00:29:16.28 --> 00:29:18.64
at this point.

365
00:29:18.64 --> 00:29:25.52
I have never seen an authentic list of the casualties of a company that day but I know this.

366
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:31.80
I never saw a single one of those 58 men of our company who went over the top that night

367
00:29:31.80 --> 00:29:37.28
again at the front.

368
00:29:37.28 --> 00:29:40.08
I had been hit several times.

369
00:29:40.08 --> 00:29:44.72
Once on the left knee, once on the right knee, either bullet could have left me crippled

370
00:29:44.72 --> 00:29:49.48
for life but both glanced off the bone leaving only a scar which is noticeable to this

371
00:29:49.48 --> 00:29:51.20
day.

372
00:29:51.20 --> 00:29:55.24
One graze my arm leaving a scar at present and inch long and three quarters of an inch

373
00:29:55.24 --> 00:29:56.24
wide.

374
00:29:56.24 --> 00:30:02.60
I had a variety of feelings as these bullets struck or scratched me.

375
00:30:02.60 --> 00:30:08.04
The first which hit my helmet gave me the same sensation as if I had been pushing, as if

376
00:30:08.04 --> 00:30:11.20
I had been pushed by a gigantic hand.

377
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:15.64
The bullets on the knees stung like I had been hit with a whip and the bullet that cut

378
00:30:15.64 --> 00:30:21.04
through the arm and the one which left its mark on my face felt like a drop of hot water

379
00:30:21.04 --> 00:30:23.24
had hit me.

380
00:30:23.24 --> 00:30:26.56
About this time, the battle had become very hot.

381
00:30:26.56 --> 00:30:31.24
We fired at every enemy we could see and they were firing from every direction from

382
00:30:31.24 --> 00:30:36.84
the front, left and right and even from behind because we had gone so fast that we had

383
00:30:36.84 --> 00:30:45.40
not dropped the snipers who were firing at us from the trees.

384
00:30:45.40 --> 00:30:50.08
Caught in a little 360 degree field of fire.

385
00:30:50.08 --> 00:30:59.08
By the way, caught in a 360 degree field of fire after you've been shot what five times.

386
00:30:59.08 --> 00:31:05.92
We talked about lucky, obviously, better to be lucky than good at this point.

387
00:31:05.92 --> 00:31:13.72
How he described getting shot, you know how you'd almost think that thing you get shot

388
00:31:13.72 --> 00:31:18.04
that would be so painful but when you're in the heat of things and I think it happened so fast

389
00:31:18.04 --> 00:31:23.04
that your nerves don't pick up on the destruction.

390
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:24.72
It depends where you get shot.

391
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:26.12
It depends where those rounds hit.

392
00:31:26.12 --> 00:31:32.88
I remember actually even here in guys from Vietnam guys from Seals from Vietnam told me

393
00:31:32.88 --> 00:31:37.56
one guy told me a story that the first time he got shot they were out in operation came

394
00:31:37.56 --> 00:31:38.56
back.

395
00:31:38.56 --> 00:31:42.92
He was literally heading out to the box and actually he said he was in the bar and he realized

396
00:31:42.92 --> 00:31:47.52
he was bleeding and he looked down and he even shot somewhere in the abdomen.

397
00:31:47.52 --> 00:31:51.80
But you know obviously it wasn't that bad but he had been shot.

398
00:31:51.80 --> 00:32:00.52
Yeah and you can catch a bolt in the wrong place and it's game over or you can catch

399
00:32:00.52 --> 00:32:03.000
a bolt in the wrong place and it can just take you off your feet or you can catch a bolt

400
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.24
in the wrong place and you're on or more moving or you can catch a bolt in the right

401
00:32:09.24 --> 00:32:15.44
place and it goes through and through it goes in and out very quickly doesn't hit anything

402
00:32:15.44 --> 00:32:19.80
vital and you know you're just kind of lucky.

403
00:32:19.80 --> 00:32:23.96
It's part of the pain goes you think it's the same thing.

404
00:32:23.96 --> 00:32:28.88
You're right sometimes it goes through and through and guys barely even notice it and

405
00:32:28.88 --> 00:32:32.56
sometimes if it hits the wrong spot it's a bone or whatever.

406
00:32:32.56 --> 00:32:35.08
I mean it's a ricochets.

407
00:32:35.08 --> 00:32:41.20
Like I hear stories about it's gonna sound kind of grotesque but like girls

408
00:32:41.20 --> 00:32:46.64
will get stabbed in the back or something and they'll be like oh it felt like I'm

409
00:32:46.64 --> 00:32:50.64
thinking of a particular story where we're about stabbed by an attacker in the back

410
00:32:50.64 --> 00:32:55.64
and she was like oh it felt like he was just beating me with his fist on my back and

411
00:32:55.64 --> 00:32:59.72
then I felt the warm blood going down you know and then later on they found out.

412
00:32:59.72 --> 00:33:04.16
It's like I don't know it's weird it happened so fast or something combined with the

413
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:07.36
adrenaline you don't feel the destruction part of it you know.

414
00:33:07.36 --> 00:33:08.96
It depends what it hits to.

415
00:33:08.96 --> 00:33:10.60
It does depend what it hits.

416
00:33:10.60 --> 00:33:11.60
It's crazy.

417
00:33:11.60 --> 00:33:13.40
It's felt like hot water.

418
00:33:13.40 --> 00:33:14.40
That's you know.

419
00:33:14.40 --> 00:33:18.08
Yeah actually I had a guy one of my guys got shot.

420
00:33:18.08 --> 00:33:24.60
He was out you know the firefight going on and all of a sudden he feels the hot you know

421
00:33:24.60 --> 00:33:29.52
a hot kind of dripping down his back hot liquid dripping down his back and it turned out

422
00:33:29.52 --> 00:33:33.36
he'd just been shot in the camel back in the camel back.

423
00:33:33.36 --> 00:33:37.12
The camel back you know those those they're like thermuses they're like a 13.

424
00:33:37.12 --> 00:33:42.16
Their soft canteen you wear when you're back and it was hot out so the water in your

425
00:33:42.16 --> 00:33:43.16
was hot.

426
00:33:43.16 --> 00:33:46.32
And he's certain if he shot he thought he got shot but it actually just hit his

427
00:33:46.32 --> 00:33:47.32
camel back.

428
00:33:47.32 --> 00:33:54.28
I remember my toenail fell off right in training that I stubbed that on a corner.

429
00:33:54.28 --> 00:34:01.64
And I almost passed out so you kind of consider the destruction you know you kind of

430
00:34:01.64 --> 00:34:02.64
compare.

431
00:34:02.64 --> 00:34:05.64
Yeah it's almost like taking a bullet would be less painful.

432
00:34:05.64 --> 00:34:07.000
Then ripping out echoes toenail.

433
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.36
Well it was my toenail that ripped off and then so it was jacked up for a few days and

434
00:34:12.36 --> 00:34:17.28
then I stubbed that on the corner of I think it was like you got a bunch of nerves in

435
00:34:17.28 --> 00:34:18.28
your toes.

436
00:34:18.28 --> 00:34:23.44
That's where you got fingernails or toenails and again the most important thing is where

437
00:34:23.44 --> 00:34:28.000
you know what is that what is that bullet hit what does that blade hit what does it do to you

438
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.36
yeah does it hit the nerve or not yeah and that adrenaline because when I got my

439
00:34:33.36 --> 00:34:38.44
toenail ripped off it hit at this weird angle where it just peeled back my whole big

440
00:34:38.44 --> 00:34:42.68
toenail and it didn't really hurt that much because I was rolling you know the adrenaline

441
00:34:42.68 --> 00:34:47.48
stuff but if I just sat there and said hey jockel peel back my toenail like that it

442
00:34:47.48 --> 00:34:48.80
probably hurt way more.

443
00:34:48.80 --> 00:34:55.80
It would hurt way more because I can't be a fall.

444
00:34:55.80 --> 00:35:02.12
All right you would go back to the book the operators of machine guns of any sorts are

445
00:35:02.12 --> 00:35:07.52
targets for all riflemen's their vulnerability and action gave rise to the term suicide

446
00:35:07.52 --> 00:35:12.60
squad Sergeant Felix called to one of the runners to bring him the gun the runner

447
00:35:12.60 --> 00:35:15.88
dropped that as he handed the gun to Felix.

448
00:35:15.88 --> 00:35:21.72
We did advance the German third line trench fighting desperately meanwhile and driving

449
00:35:21.72 --> 00:35:24.16
the Germans before us.

450
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:29.32
I had not reached any of them with my bayonet but had been doing the deadly work with my

451
00:35:29.32 --> 00:35:31.04
rifle.

452
00:35:31.04 --> 00:35:35.16
As we rushed to the German trench expecting to jump down into it and fight hand to hand

453
00:35:35.16 --> 00:35:39.64
with the enemy we saw that we could not do this.

454
00:35:39.64 --> 00:35:45.12
The trench was covered thoroughly with barbed wire so that nothing much larger than a humming

455
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:48.08
bird could get in.

456
00:35:48.08 --> 00:35:52.68
We laid down outside the parapet to fire at close range someone shouted look out there's

457
00:35:52.68 --> 00:35:53.68
a bomb.

458
00:35:53.68 --> 00:36:01.12
It went right off in my face but all my parts seemed to be present immediately afterwards.

459
00:36:01.12 --> 00:36:05.48
I saw Felix lying there sprawled out, grouping for his pistol.

460
00:36:05.48 --> 00:36:07.44
I said what's the matter Bill?

461
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:12.56
He couldn't answer but turned weekly to me and I saw that half his face seemed to have

462
00:36:12.56 --> 00:36:15.08
been torn off.

463
00:36:15.08 --> 00:36:20.36
I picked up the automatic rifle and as I turned it into the German trench they got

464
00:36:20.36 --> 00:36:21.96
up and ran back.

465
00:36:21.96 --> 00:36:23.60
I was the only one firing.

466
00:36:23.60 --> 00:36:28.28
I saw many of them drop with a 60 shots a minute I was pumping it them so I knew I was

467
00:36:28.28 --> 00:36:33.92
getting enough of the enemy to make up for our men who had been killed and wounded.

468
00:36:33.92 --> 00:36:39.000
For a time there was nothing to shoot at so I took stock of the situation.

469
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.48
So far back they were hardly more than specs I saw tiny men in blue digging in.

470
00:36:45.48 --> 00:36:48.76
They must have been all half a mile.

471
00:36:48.76 --> 00:36:52.84
I knew that we should not stay out here in such an isolated post but what we would

472
00:36:52.84 --> 00:36:54.16
do.

473
00:36:54.16 --> 00:36:58.28
I never thought for a minute of abandoning the wounded.

474
00:36:58.28 --> 00:37:00.36
So there we stayed.

475
00:37:00.36 --> 00:37:03.72
The snipers far off in the wood were still firing at us and there was no way we could

476
00:37:03.72 --> 00:37:07.64
reach them or entirely escape their bullets.

477
00:37:07.64 --> 00:37:11.24
I couldn't get into the trench so I called crawled around it.

478
00:37:11.24 --> 00:37:14.32
Well over into the woods.

479
00:37:14.32 --> 00:37:16.36
Shell holes everywhere.

480
00:37:16.36 --> 00:37:21.000
I saw for the first time what havoc could be wrought by shell fire.

481
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.16
At places the shell holes were connected solidly to each other.

482
00:37:25.16 --> 00:37:27.24
The trees and bushes were shattered.

483
00:37:27.24 --> 00:37:29.96
Men were blown up and blown up again.

484
00:37:29.96 --> 00:37:32.04
They were in pieces.

485
00:37:32.04 --> 00:37:37.000
It would have taken a bushel basket or a GI can to have gathered up all those Germans for

486
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.36
burial.

487
00:37:40.36 --> 00:37:45.08
I admit that they were the finest of soldiers after four years of war they fought to the

488
00:37:45.08 --> 00:37:49.16
death before they would give up a position.

489
00:37:49.16 --> 00:37:53.000
They were so well trained that it was second nature with them.

490
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.08
They had been regimented for so long that they never questioned an order put up with all sorts

491
00:37:57.08 --> 00:38:02.52
of privation and suffering and were cheerful food all.

492
00:38:02.52 --> 00:38:06.32
The majority of them were in very good condition when captured.

493
00:38:06.32 --> 00:38:08.40
It showed they could take it.

494
00:38:08.40 --> 00:38:14.96
I often wondered if our own men could be as good soldiers after four years of war.

495
00:38:14.96 --> 00:38:18.68
All of us could not be brave.

496
00:38:18.68 --> 00:38:21.16
Braveery is a sort of fixed quality.

497
00:38:21.16 --> 00:38:26.12
Something that some men have and others do not.

498
00:38:26.12 --> 00:38:31.64
Only physical collapse or death stops the brave.

499
00:38:31.64 --> 00:38:33.64
Some will be brave when they must.

500
00:38:33.64 --> 00:38:39.40
And they, like a mother animal, are driven by the instinct of self-prepared preservation

501
00:38:39.40 --> 00:38:44.24
to protect their own lives or that of their offspring.

502
00:38:44.24 --> 00:38:48.32
A man who naturally has courage is fortunate.

503
00:38:48.32 --> 00:38:56.16
It is the ability to control his mind to prepare it so that he feels nothing.

504
00:38:56.16 --> 00:39:01.68
Courage is the product of physical strength and mental strength combined.

505
00:39:01.68 --> 00:39:10.84
Courage training will make men more courageous and certainly these Germans were courageous.

506
00:39:10.84 --> 00:39:16.68
Physical strength and mental strength combined.

507
00:39:16.68 --> 00:39:19.60
That's where that courage comes from.

508
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:23.28
Back to the book, I tried to do something for the wounded.

509
00:39:23.28 --> 00:39:27.04
They were very cold by this time suffering from loss of blood.

510
00:39:27.04 --> 00:39:29.04
They were lying there stripped of the waste.

511
00:39:29.04 --> 00:39:32.16
I reached for the canteen of one of the dead men.

512
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:36.08
There were two bullet holes through mine and it was empty.

513
00:39:36.08 --> 00:39:40.48
Just as I turned a bullet from afar off to the left, toward through the flesh of my

514
00:39:40.48 --> 00:39:43.92
cheek, had I not turned at that very instant.

515
00:39:43.92 --> 00:39:51.52
It would have gone through my head dead center, killing me or sadly made me for life.

516
00:39:51.52 --> 00:39:57.68
Little Volcina, who lay there, was just 16 years of age.

517
00:39:57.68 --> 00:40:04.48
He was the first of a dozen youngsters whose ages ranged from 14 to 16 who would have listed

518
00:40:04.48 --> 00:40:07.32
in our company.

519
00:40:07.32 --> 00:40:13.88
They had lied about their actual age enamored with the appearance of our fellows in uniform.

520
00:40:13.88 --> 00:40:17.64
They too wanted to be soldiers.

521
00:40:17.64 --> 00:40:21.60
Some of them lost their nerve before they reached the front and tried in many ways to get

522
00:40:21.60 --> 00:40:23.92
out of service.

523
00:40:23.92 --> 00:40:31.72
The Spencer Brothers 15 and 16 years of age were to be killed by Shell Fire.

524
00:40:31.72 --> 00:40:34.28
There was no fear in this little Italian boy.

525
00:40:34.28 --> 00:40:38.48
He's talking about a little Volcina.

526
00:40:38.48 --> 00:40:43.60
He'd always been a hot head wanting to fight with a knife fork or anything he could

527
00:40:43.60 --> 00:40:47.000
lay his hands on when someone antagonized him a bit.

528
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
He was dashing forward with banded and rifle and hand so fast when the bullet which killed

529
00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:03.88
him, which hit him that he lay out well on the barbed wire covering the German trench.

530
00:41:03.88 --> 00:41:11.32
Kids 14, 15 and 16 years old.

531
00:41:11.32 --> 00:41:18.38
I don't, I'm not saying anything bad about our current state in America, but I have a hard

532
00:41:18.38 --> 00:41:27.18
time picture in the current brood of 14, 15 and 16 year olds getting their trench warfare

533
00:41:27.18 --> 00:41:30.46
on.

534
00:41:30.46 --> 00:41:34.70
14, 15 and 16 years old.

535
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:40.54
Face to face with the Germans.

536
00:41:40.54 --> 00:41:41.54
Back to the book.

537
00:41:41.54 --> 00:41:45.86
I crawled back and there was one of our men crying.

538
00:41:45.86 --> 00:41:50.82
I asked him why and he replied that so many of his friends had been killed.

539
00:41:50.82 --> 00:41:55.98
I told him not to worry about the killed that we had living wounded to be concerned about,

540
00:41:55.98 --> 00:42:04.34
to get back, that he'd better go for help and stretchers and see if we could not evacuate

541
00:42:04.34 --> 00:42:10.10
our fellows.

542
00:42:10.10 --> 00:42:16.02
I had no other thought than that I should die as bravely as I could for my friends or

543
00:42:16.02 --> 00:42:18.62
country or something.

544
00:42:18.62 --> 00:42:23.78
So I prepared to sell my life as dearly as possible.

545
00:42:23.78 --> 00:42:29.42
In a surprisingly few minutes there came a crashing through the woods, the sound of voices

546
00:42:29.42 --> 00:42:33.06
and a large body of men came into view.

547
00:42:33.06 --> 00:42:38.10
I lay still, waited until they were close and then jumped up pointing my automatic rifle

548
00:42:38.10 --> 00:42:41.54
at them and was prepared to go into action.

549
00:42:41.54 --> 00:42:49.22
I suppose it was very startling to have a dead men jump up for I certainly looked dead.

550
00:42:49.22 --> 00:42:57.10
I pulled the trigger and as soon as one man fell, the other all shouted, comrade.

551
00:42:57.10 --> 00:42:58.62
It's like holding up a train.

552
00:42:58.62 --> 00:43:04.90
No one wants to be the first killed, so a crowded car permits one man to hold it up.

553
00:43:04.90 --> 00:43:10.42
When the Germans found that I had stopped firing, they were anxious to surrender.

554
00:43:10.42 --> 00:43:15.46
Their officer was as nice and polite as any headwader in a high-class restaurant.

555
00:43:15.46 --> 00:43:19.42
He knew a little English and understood when I told him to have his men pile the arms

556
00:43:19.42 --> 00:43:24.42
in one place, put their packs in another and make improvised stretchers to carry back the

557
00:43:24.42 --> 00:43:26.22
wounded.

558
00:43:26.22 --> 00:43:33.70
This all took just a few minutes and soon we were starting back.

559
00:43:33.70 --> 00:43:40.30
So the tough Germans ended up capturing a bunch of Germans and he actually makes a funny

560
00:43:40.30 --> 00:43:47.62
comment here that he says that as he was walking back with all these Germans at he had

561
00:43:47.62 --> 00:43:53.14
captured, a couple of guys now helped him once he got off the front lines and he says

562
00:43:53.14 --> 00:43:58.54
that his award says that he had assisted in the capture of 38 Germans.

563
00:43:58.54 --> 00:44:02.46
He can see he's kind of upset about that because he didn't buy himself.

564
00:44:02.46 --> 00:44:08.06
He didn't assist, he got the whole thing done.

565
00:44:08.06 --> 00:44:13.34
And now he ends up because of the wounds that he suffered, he ends up in the hospital.

566
00:44:13.34 --> 00:44:16.78
Then he starts having thoughts and explaining what it's like being in the hospital and

567
00:44:16.78 --> 00:44:21.02
the people that are in there with them.

568
00:44:21.02 --> 00:44:26.58
Youth of all nations seldom reckons the cost.

569
00:44:26.58 --> 00:44:30.90
They make the best soldiers because they will go out and try to die bravely for their

570
00:44:30.90 --> 00:44:35.78
countries as I expected and tried to do.

571
00:44:35.78 --> 00:44:37.74
Older men are more cautious.

572
00:44:37.74 --> 00:44:41.54
They have homes, perhaps families, positions.

573
00:44:41.54 --> 00:44:43.46
They know about life.

574
00:44:43.46 --> 00:44:47.06
They usually know the folly of war.

575
00:44:47.06 --> 00:44:53.62
They are careful and battles are not one by being careful.

576
00:44:53.62 --> 00:44:58.58
The impetuous youthful soldiers are the best fighters.

577
00:44:58.58 --> 00:45:04.26
That's why war will always take the flower of the manhood of the nations involved.

578
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:11.46
The strongest, most intelligence, most useful of men.

579
00:45:11.46 --> 00:45:13.34
Now he starts talking about what happens.

580
00:45:13.34 --> 00:45:17.90
He's again still in the hospital trying to recover from the wounds.

581
00:45:17.90 --> 00:45:19.54
He has his wounds.

582
00:45:19.54 --> 00:45:25.62
Obviously, Ernest Bad is some of the other wounded that he's in there with.

583
00:45:25.62 --> 00:45:31.54
Back to the book, when a man was dying, they would move him out.

584
00:45:31.54 --> 00:45:38.42
It was bad enough for him to die without his comrades who did not know when their own

585
00:45:38.42 --> 00:45:40.50
turn might come.

586
00:45:40.50 --> 00:45:44.46
Having to watch him die.

587
00:45:44.46 --> 00:45:48.06
Some of the men went out screaming when they were moved.

588
00:45:48.06 --> 00:45:52.14
The nurses would try and ease their going by telling them that they were only going to

589
00:45:52.14 --> 00:45:59.34
be operating room for minor treatment or to the dressing room to have their bandages changed.

590
00:45:59.34 --> 00:46:04.86
The fellows soon learned to observe whether the little bag which held their personal belongings,

591
00:46:04.86 --> 00:46:10.38
sometimes a helmet or a coat came with them.

592
00:46:10.38 --> 00:46:14.02
If it remained behind, they could expect to come back.

593
00:46:14.02 --> 00:46:20.22
But if it too was moved, then they were sure that worse was in store for them.

594
00:46:20.22 --> 00:46:24.10
Some bag to be left there to die with their friends around them, not to be placed with

595
00:46:24.10 --> 00:46:31.02
a lot of near corpses who were complete strangers.

596
00:46:31.02 --> 00:46:35.34
The more pitifully wounded did not wish to live.

597
00:46:35.34 --> 00:46:40.70
They constantly begged doctors and nurses, sometimes at the top of their voices, to put

598
00:46:40.70 --> 00:46:44.10
an end to them.

599
00:46:44.10 --> 00:46:49.42
Some made attempts to end their lives with a knife or fork.

600
00:46:49.42 --> 00:46:56.98
They became necessary to feed these wounded and never leave a knife or a fork with them.

601
00:46:56.98 --> 00:47:02.10
A blinded man who was suffering greatly and did not wish to live had killed himself

602
00:47:02.10 --> 00:47:04.86
for the fork.

603
00:47:04.86 --> 00:47:10.02
It was hard to drive it deep enough through his chest to end his life and he kept hitting

604
00:47:10.02 --> 00:47:17.62
it with his clenched fist to drive it deeper.

605
00:47:17.62 --> 00:47:27.86
That is, I guess about his bad as it gets.

606
00:47:27.86 --> 00:47:38.82
When you have individuals that survived combat, but are in such a wretched state, that

607
00:47:38.82 --> 00:47:48.98
would hold your killed himself for the fork.

608
00:47:48.98 --> 00:47:55.90
They know one of my guys, one of my buddies, Brian Job, he got blinded.

609
00:47:55.90 --> 00:48:02.74
They involved fires after he took around to the face.

610
00:48:02.74 --> 00:48:06.30
It really does show you.

611
00:48:06.30 --> 00:48:14.54
We now talk to him on the phone when we were still over there and his attitude was so

612
00:48:14.54 --> 00:48:15.54
indomitable.

613
00:48:15.54 --> 00:48:18.54
His spirit was so strong.

614
00:48:18.54 --> 00:48:21.30
I'll tell you something else.

615
00:48:21.30 --> 00:48:25.22
He had been sent to at one point.

616
00:48:25.22 --> 00:48:31.94
He was sent to the place where they have the guys that have had traumatic brain injuries

617
00:48:31.94 --> 00:48:36.34
who are having trouble with their thoughts and with their motor skills and guys that are

618
00:48:36.34 --> 00:48:39.86
in really bad shape.

619
00:48:39.86 --> 00:48:45.90
When he was there and I talked to him on the phone, he was spent about a week there.

620
00:48:45.90 --> 00:48:56.06
He told me, I think I think he had already left, but he said, basically told him, hey,

621
00:48:56.06 --> 00:48:57.38
get me out of here.

622
00:48:57.38 --> 00:48:59.62
I don't need the kind of help these guys need.

623
00:48:59.62 --> 00:49:01.30
I'm taking up someone's bed.

624
00:49:01.30 --> 00:49:07.30
So even though he was blind and of course he was a tough bastard, but I mean, tough

625
00:49:07.30 --> 00:49:08.30
bastard not, he was blind.

626
00:49:08.30 --> 00:49:12.02
I mean, that's game changer, obviously.

627
00:49:12.02 --> 00:49:16.30
But he still looked at the guys that were wounded worse than him.

628
00:49:16.30 --> 00:49:18.58
It was like, hey, I don't want to take up anybody's bed.

629
00:49:18.58 --> 00:49:19.58
I'm good.

630
00:49:19.58 --> 00:49:20.58
I'll be okay.

631
00:49:20.58 --> 00:49:23.98
I can't see, but I'm good.

632
00:49:23.98 --> 00:49:25.62
Did you say he went to come back to?

633
00:49:25.62 --> 00:49:28.62
Oh yeah, of course.

634
00:49:28.62 --> 00:49:33.78
Yeah, he was like, tell me, just let me come back.

635
00:49:33.78 --> 00:49:43.30
Let me come back and I can, I can stand watch because I can smell him.

636
00:49:43.30 --> 00:49:51.90
And unfortunately, he didn't get a chance to go back.

637
00:49:51.90 --> 00:50:01.26
So now there's a, the Germans had made a drive for Paris and the Americans were now involved

638
00:50:01.26 --> 00:50:09.18
in a counterattack and Bob Hoffman is still in the hospital.

639
00:50:09.18 --> 00:50:13.82
And now the wounded start coming in from this counterattack.

640
00:50:13.82 --> 00:50:19.10
The wounded that came in now were particularly serious cases, men who had been wounded by

641
00:50:19.10 --> 00:50:22.14
tremendous shells.

642
00:50:22.14 --> 00:50:28.34
There was much screaming and anguish displayed by the sorely wounded men.

643
00:50:28.34 --> 00:50:31.66
Seldom was a quiet at night.

644
00:50:31.66 --> 00:50:36.38
Men whose nerves broke would be screaming all night.

645
00:50:36.38 --> 00:50:39.42
There were many cases of shell shock.

646
00:50:39.42 --> 00:50:45.30
Men who had had their maniacal moments when they felt that they were still at the front

647
00:50:45.30 --> 00:50:48.58
being subjected to shell fire.

648
00:50:48.58 --> 00:50:53.42
They were out of their minds and there was nothing that could be done about it.

649
00:50:53.42 --> 00:50:58.90
But it made it most unpleasant for the other wounded.

650
00:50:58.90 --> 00:51:03.94
Horrible cases of mustard gas were everywhere.

651
00:51:03.94 --> 00:51:08.86
Some of these men were blinded and had to lie for endless days with their heads covered

652
00:51:08.86 --> 00:51:12.22
with bandages.

653
00:51:12.22 --> 00:51:18.90
So the men were able to walk, spray to leg it down the aisles.

654
00:51:18.90 --> 00:51:26.38
I was told that their testicles had in some cases shriveled up like dry peas in a pod.

655
00:51:26.38 --> 00:51:33.06
They were certainly in a bad way.

656
00:51:33.06 --> 00:51:40.74
So the mustard gas, it attacks the softest part of your tissues.

657
00:51:40.74 --> 00:51:51.50
So your eyes, your testicles, anywhere where there's moisture and softness.

658
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:59.10
And on the 21st of July, the doctors decide that he's fit to go back to the front.

659
00:51:59.10 --> 00:52:00.66
He gets on a train.

660
00:52:00.66 --> 00:52:02.90
I can't imagine you go.

661
00:52:02.90 --> 00:52:04.10
You fight this battle.

662
00:52:04.10 --> 00:52:05.10
You get wounded.

663
00:52:05.10 --> 00:52:06.10
You come back.

664
00:52:06.10 --> 00:52:07.98
You're watching guys come in.

665
00:52:07.98 --> 00:52:12.14
You're better severely wounded shell shock mustard gas.

666
00:52:12.14 --> 00:52:14.30
And then they say, okay, by the way, now you're good to go.

667
00:52:14.30 --> 00:52:15.90
We're going to send you back out to the front.

668
00:52:15.90 --> 00:52:19.14
Like you think you got that million dollar wound that we talk about in a bunch of these

669
00:52:19.14 --> 00:52:22.22
episodes where people say, oh, I made it off the front.

670
00:52:22.22 --> 00:52:27.18
He goes off the front for I don't even think it's a month, I think it's a few weeks.

671
00:52:27.18 --> 00:52:29.70
And now you're fit for duty again.

672
00:52:29.70 --> 00:52:30.70
Back to the front.

673
00:52:30.70 --> 00:52:31.70
Back to the front.

674
00:52:31.70 --> 00:52:37.70
Back to the meat grinder.

675
00:52:37.70 --> 00:52:41.90
Meat goes there by train and surprisingly short time at about two o'clock where close

676
00:52:41.90 --> 00:52:45.90
enough to the front that we'd started to see the dead soldiers of both armies along the

677
00:52:45.90 --> 00:52:47.42
way.

678
00:52:47.42 --> 00:52:51.78
The American soldiers had been buried hastily and holes dead dug along the road as they were

679
00:52:51.78 --> 00:52:53.58
advancing.

680
00:52:53.58 --> 00:52:56.78
But there were still many of them laying in the fields.

681
00:52:56.78 --> 00:53:04.50
I could see their khaki uniforms and their white faces as we passed.

682
00:53:04.50 --> 00:53:09.58
There are two chief reasons why a soldier feels fear.

683
00:53:09.58 --> 00:53:13.06
First they will not get home to see his loved ones again.

684
00:53:13.06 --> 00:53:19.78
But most of all, picturing himself in the same position as some of the dead men we saw.

685
00:53:19.78 --> 00:53:25.02
They lay their face up usually in the rain, their eyes open, their faces pale and chalk

686
00:53:25.02 --> 00:53:29.14
like their gold teeth showing.

687
00:53:29.14 --> 00:53:31.46
That isn't the beginning.

688
00:53:31.46 --> 00:53:34.90
After that they are usually too horrible to think about.

689
00:53:34.90 --> 00:53:39.94
We buried them as fast as we could, Germans, French and Americans alike, get them out

690
00:53:39.94 --> 00:53:44.10
of sight, but not out of memory.

691
00:53:44.10 --> 00:53:48.18
I can remember hundreds and hundreds of dead men.

692
00:53:48.18 --> 00:53:53.18
I would know them now if I were to meet them in the year after.

693
00:53:53.18 --> 00:53:57.46
I could tell them where they were laying and how they were killed, whether with shell

694
00:53:57.46 --> 00:54:04.18
fire, gas, machine gun, or bayonet.

695
00:54:04.18 --> 00:54:07.02
In the beginning we had a fear of the dead.

696
00:54:07.02 --> 00:54:08.82
We hated to touch them.

697
00:54:08.82 --> 00:54:12.82
Some of the hardest experience of my life were taking the identification tags from my

698
00:54:12.82 --> 00:54:15.34
dead friends.

699
00:54:15.34 --> 00:54:21.10
The first dead man I touched was Philip Beckettich, an Austrian baker who was with our

700
00:54:21.10 --> 00:54:24.10
company.

701
00:54:24.10 --> 00:54:28.50
I tried to save his life by carrying him through heavy enemy fire and putting him in one

702
00:54:28.50 --> 00:54:32.42
of the sellers of the French houses.

703
00:54:32.42 --> 00:54:36.06
He was shot in my arms as I carried him.

704
00:54:36.06 --> 00:54:41.70
A few hours later I found time to go round and find how he was.

705
00:54:41.70 --> 00:54:46.66
He was dead, stiff and cold.

706
00:54:46.66 --> 00:54:51.54
I had to remove his identification tags and they slipped down between his collar bones and

707
00:54:51.54 --> 00:54:54.14
the flesh of his chest.

708
00:54:54.14 --> 00:54:59.58
They were held there and it took an effort to get them out.

709
00:54:59.58 --> 00:55:06.10
I thrilled and chilled with horror as I touched him.

710
00:55:06.10 --> 00:55:08.50
It was hard to touch these dead men at first.

711
00:55:08.50 --> 00:55:13.86
My people at home hearing of what I was passing through expected me to come back hard, brutal,

712
00:55:13.86 --> 00:55:20.46
countless careless, but I didn't even want to take a dead mouse out of the trap when I got

713
00:55:20.46 --> 00:55:22.46
home.

714
00:55:22.46 --> 00:55:26.82
Yet over there I buried 78 men one morning.

715
00:55:26.82 --> 00:55:30.70
I didn't dig the holes for them of course, but I did take their personal belongings

716
00:55:30.70 --> 00:55:37.62
from them to return to their people, their rings, trinkets, letters, and identification

717
00:55:37.62 --> 00:55:40.82
tags.

718
00:55:40.82 --> 00:55:48.74
We hear these days people will talk about seeing a dead body and how that's a traumatic

719
00:55:48.74 --> 00:55:49.74
experience.

720
00:55:49.74 --> 00:55:59.58
It is a matter of fact my son, he has found a dead body, one down on the beach and one guy

721
00:55:59.58 --> 00:56:02.34
fell off the cliff by my house.

722
00:56:02.34 --> 00:56:04.58
I saw that in the news.

723
00:56:04.58 --> 00:56:10.54
People were saying, oh, you should make sure you talk about it with them and make sure

724
00:56:10.54 --> 00:56:11.54
he's okay and all that.

725
00:56:11.54 --> 00:56:15.30
Great, you're concerned.

726
00:56:15.30 --> 00:56:19.70
But can you imagine, I mean, you're just seeing dead body after dead body after dead body,

727
00:56:19.70 --> 00:56:23.86
after dead body after dead body after dead body after dead body because it's on and on and

728
00:56:23.86 --> 00:56:24.86
on?

729
00:56:24.86 --> 00:56:37.06
Yeah, like that kind of, this kind of, if you're in that environment, sometimes it could

730
00:56:37.06 --> 00:56:41.22
you could have that kind of desensitized feeling.

731
00:56:41.22 --> 00:56:45.78
But I want to imagine it would really come to get you after everything comes down, like

732
00:56:45.78 --> 00:56:50.26
how he was saying he didn't even want to take a mouse out of the child dead mouse because

733
00:56:50.26 --> 00:56:57.62
it's a reminder in this calm environment, a reminder of just all that death, you know?

734
00:56:57.62 --> 00:57:02.78
But at the time, it seems like there, almost like there could be two kinds of reactions

735
00:57:02.78 --> 00:57:06.86
to it where they either get used to it or get tired of it kind of thing.

736
00:57:06.86 --> 00:57:09.82
And then so if you get tired of it, it's just way on you way on you way on you.

737
00:57:09.82 --> 00:57:13.46
But if you get used to it, it just gets less and less impactful, you know?

738
00:57:13.46 --> 00:57:16.82
Yeah, well, obviously they had to deal with it.

739
00:57:16.82 --> 00:57:17.94
They had to detach from it.

740
00:57:17.94 --> 00:57:20.90
You couldn't, I mean, it's just like you talked to a doctor that's been in practice for

741
00:57:20.90 --> 00:57:21.90
a long time.

742
00:57:21.90 --> 00:57:25.18
Eventually, they cannot get emotionally attached to every patient that they had or they would

743
00:57:25.18 --> 00:57:26.42
go completely insane.

744
00:57:26.42 --> 00:57:27.66
They wouldn't be able to do the job.

745
00:57:27.66 --> 00:57:28.66
But it's the same thing here.

746
00:57:28.66 --> 00:57:33.22
Obviously, you can't get emotionally attached to every single body that it's dealing with.

747
00:57:33.22 --> 00:57:35.18
But you can tell that it leaves a mark.

748
00:57:35.18 --> 00:57:36.58
Yes, fully.

749
00:57:36.58 --> 00:57:41.78
And you think that, I mean, the doctor's who did a good analogy, but the thing that the

750
00:57:41.78 --> 00:57:45.46
doctor has, and I was talking to Luke, you know, Dr. Luke, we're talking about it.

751
00:57:45.46 --> 00:57:49.82
Jade asked him that question, like, does it ever weird you out when you're operating on

752
00:57:49.82 --> 00:57:51.10
somebody or whatever?

753
00:57:51.10 --> 00:57:57.42
And what doctors get is this sense of, okay, so not only the job, but it's almost like

754
00:57:57.42 --> 00:58:01.62
working on a car because you kind of know all the little working parts and you can fix

755
00:58:01.62 --> 00:58:06.30
them, use them together and boom, it works now, you know, kind of, so there's that element

756
00:58:06.30 --> 00:58:07.30
of thinking.

757
00:58:07.30 --> 00:58:10.58
And then, yeah, sure on the other side, it's a person.

758
00:58:10.58 --> 00:58:13.22
And if you know the guy, you know, it might even be more personal.

759
00:58:13.22 --> 00:58:18.86
But in war, it seems way more dark because the guy's not supposed to be dead.

760
00:58:18.86 --> 00:58:21.46
You know, the goal is to live into when the war.

761
00:58:21.46 --> 00:58:25.34
Death is literally like the worst case scenario for the person or one of them.

762
00:58:25.34 --> 00:58:30.42
So when you see someone dead, it's like, man, it's not.

763
00:58:30.42 --> 00:58:34.54
It's part of the job, but it's not the outcome that you're the goal.

764
00:58:34.54 --> 00:58:37.18
It's no part of the goal is to die ever.

765
00:58:37.18 --> 00:58:38.74
It's like the bad part.

766
00:58:38.74 --> 00:58:46.54
So it can't be substituted with, hey, you know, that you can't substitute your thinking

767
00:58:46.54 --> 00:58:50.14
in regards to this dead person with, you know, part of being part of my goal of my job,

768
00:58:50.14 --> 00:58:51.14
you know.

769
00:58:51.14 --> 00:58:56.62
Yeah, although I will say that, you know, when you've got at least we had a, we have

770
00:58:56.62 --> 00:59:03.26
a volunteer military service and everybody that joins up knows that that's part of the

771
00:59:03.26 --> 00:59:05.14
risk of the job.

772
00:59:05.14 --> 00:59:11.58
So at least, even though that's obviously not the goal, you know, that guy's, have

773
00:59:11.58 --> 00:59:16.94
at least come to grips with the reality that that's what they may face.

774
00:59:16.94 --> 00:59:17.94
Yeah, absolutely.

775
00:59:17.94 --> 00:59:22.98
I like if you're a fighter in the guy, you know, getting knocked out, seeing a guy

776
00:59:22.98 --> 00:59:25.74
you knocked out, you know, broken leg or something like that.

777
00:59:25.74 --> 00:59:32.62
It's part of the game, you know, but obviously way, not quite as heavy as the war situation.

778
00:59:32.62 --> 00:59:39.86
So speaking of which back to the book here, they are, he's now just fighting and he's

779
00:59:39.86 --> 00:59:46.78
with another guy named Vaughn and Vaughn kind of pokes his head up above this barricade

780
00:59:46.78 --> 00:59:49.50
and starts shooting.

781
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:52.86
And he's kind of looking at him thinking that seems pretty dangerous, but he sees Vaughn

782
00:59:52.86 --> 00:59:56.86
and getting away with it.

783
00:59:56.86 --> 01:00:00.78
So he gets up there too and starts shooting and soon they're firing shots and then back

784
01:00:00.78 --> 01:00:02.30
to the book here.

785
01:00:02.30 --> 01:00:06.86
But after several shots each, I suddenly saw Vaughn's helmet go sailing down over the

786
01:00:06.86 --> 01:00:08.94
slight hill.

787
01:00:08.94 --> 01:00:15.86
I looked at him and the entire top of his head was off, apparently a dumb, dumb type bullet,

788
01:00:15.86 --> 01:00:21.26
one in which the lead had been cut so it would spread in the instant struck, tearing

789
01:00:21.26 --> 01:00:24.62
a terrific hole in the objected hit.

790
01:00:24.62 --> 01:00:31.54
Had flattened against his helmet or tin hat and had taken his head off his head to a level

791
01:00:31.54 --> 01:00:34.70
with his eyes and ears.

792
01:00:34.70 --> 01:00:39.86
He had been kneeling and his buttocks went back a bit, his head forward and his brains

793
01:00:39.86 --> 01:00:44.82
ran out there in front of me like soup from a pot.

794
01:00:44.82 --> 01:00:49.26
I did not fire over another wall.

795
01:00:49.26 --> 01:00:54.62
The sniper had his choice to pick one or the other of us.

796
01:00:54.62 --> 01:00:58.54
For some unknown reason he chose Vaughn.

797
01:00:58.54 --> 01:01:02.02
I'm here and he's gone.

798
01:01:02.02 --> 01:01:07.46
Vaughn lay there for a couple days, find that he was carried down and stored in the room

799
01:01:07.46 --> 01:01:13.10
where we had the other dead piled up like logs of wood.

800
01:01:13.10 --> 01:01:17.42
But he had to have his own place in the corner.

801
01:01:17.42 --> 01:01:25.98
It was gruesome enough.

802
01:01:25.98 --> 01:01:32.22
The nerve strain of the constant gas attacks was severe.

803
01:01:32.22 --> 01:01:36.66
We were waking up at every hour of the day and night to stand to and preparation for an

804
01:01:36.66 --> 01:01:45.62
attack to prepare to move on or at least put our gas masks on.

805
01:01:45.62 --> 01:01:51.66
And now they're getting ready to do another assault.

806
01:01:51.66 --> 01:01:55.78
One of the greatest barrages in the history of the war was being put over.

807
01:01:55.78 --> 01:02:00.90
The earth and the air constantly trembled with the force of explosions.

808
01:02:00.90 --> 01:02:06.74
Each flare would show us the details of no manland, no man's land between the lines.

809
01:02:06.74 --> 01:02:10.90
Dead men were laying everywhere in the most grotesque positions.

810
01:02:10.90 --> 01:02:13.58
Some of them lay as if sound asleep.

811
01:02:13.58 --> 01:02:19.50
One man's head rested so comfortably on his arm that I cannot believe he was dead.

812
01:02:19.50 --> 01:02:26.90
Others had been blown to pieces several times and some were just arms and legs or torsos.

813
01:02:26.90 --> 01:02:32.10
This night approached to the front made us sick.

814
01:02:32.10 --> 01:02:37.98
As we finally found the men we were to relieve, we were all thoroughly sick.

815
01:02:37.98 --> 01:02:44.86
The ground was rotten with tear and vomiting gas. Mustard gas too was all around.

816
01:02:44.86 --> 01:02:50.66
War was bad enough without the constant torture of gas.

817
01:02:50.66 --> 01:02:55.62
There was a constant cry for stretcher bearers for the red cross, the most diabolical

818
01:02:55.62 --> 01:02:59.46
screaming and moaning that could be imagined.

819
01:02:59.46 --> 01:03:05.62
Human beings lying helpless no way to fight back, not knowing who would be killed by the

820
01:03:05.62 --> 01:03:08.62
next shell.

821
01:03:08.62 --> 01:03:11.78
It is hard to be brave at night.

822
01:03:11.78 --> 01:03:15.62
Shelling at night saps the courage from the bravest.

823
01:03:15.62 --> 01:03:18.06
Everyone lies there, shakes.

824
01:03:18.06 --> 01:03:22.26
Only the strongest can keep their right minds.

825
01:03:22.26 --> 01:03:28.34
It is on such nights as this that men go out of their heads.

826
01:03:28.34 --> 01:03:32.30
One will never know how he will behave in such an ordeal.

827
01:03:32.30 --> 01:03:37.98
Men weep other shake, some stand up non-chalantly, apparently not caring whether they

828
01:03:37.98 --> 01:03:44.78
get killed or wounded, some tell crude jokes, but mostly the men dig and dig.

829
01:03:44.78 --> 01:03:49.54
That is only the direct hits that will get them.

830
01:03:49.54 --> 01:03:54.46
Grimly enduring the torture that human being subject to each other too, not knowing who

831
01:03:54.46 --> 01:03:57.38
will go next.

832
01:03:57.38 --> 01:04:03.14
We spent five days in that place which was popular called Death Valley.

833
01:04:03.14 --> 01:04:07.22
I don't know whether there was any real object and staying and dying there, but we were

834
01:04:07.22 --> 01:04:12.10
ordered into that valley and there we stayed.

835
01:04:12.10 --> 01:04:16.82
There were always a few maniacs around, men who had lost their mind through shell fire and

836
01:04:16.82 --> 01:04:20.50
had to be overpowered and bound.

837
01:04:20.50 --> 01:04:27.14
Some men were buried alive and we were constantly busy digging out the live ones.

838
01:04:27.14 --> 01:04:30.90
Many would be smothered before we could get them out.

839
01:04:30.90 --> 01:04:35.38
At times we would have a group of wounded and stretcher bears making their way up the hill,

840
01:04:35.38 --> 01:04:40.22
a shell would fall among them and nearly all would be killed.

841
01:04:40.22 --> 01:04:48.74
So many men were wounded, wounded again and were still under fire.

842
01:04:48.74 --> 01:04:53.82
Sometimes we found two or three men dead together and so badly mixed up that we could not

843
01:04:53.82 --> 01:05:00.26
tell whether we got the right parts and the right grave or not.

844
01:05:00.26 --> 01:05:06.34
The men suffered and so did the horses.

845
01:05:06.34 --> 01:05:10.70
One of my most painful memories at the front was seeing a shell drop near to artillery

846
01:05:10.70 --> 01:05:12.70
horses.

847
01:05:12.70 --> 01:05:16.58
The horses broke away from the tree to which they were secured and galloped up through

848
01:05:16.58 --> 01:05:18.78
the field.

849
01:05:18.78 --> 01:05:21.58
One of the horses was hitting the abdomen.

850
01:05:21.58 --> 01:05:28.02
It's in test and dropped out, dragged on the ground and soon it's feet were entangled

851
01:05:28.02 --> 01:05:33.54
in its own intestines to the point where it fell down and could not run any further.

852
01:05:33.54 --> 01:05:38.74
It lay there where it's head up for what seemed like to be an endless period.

853
01:05:38.74 --> 01:05:43.82
It seemed to be more surprised concerning how it had become entangled in its own parts

854
01:05:43.82 --> 01:05:46.62
than in the pain.

855
01:05:46.62 --> 01:05:52.18
We were sorry that it was so situated by this time that it was difficult to put it out

856
01:05:52.18 --> 01:05:54.70
of its misery.

857
01:05:54.70 --> 01:06:03.06
I think most people when they think of horses, you just think of a beautiful creature running

858
01:06:03.06 --> 01:06:06.54
free.

859
01:06:06.54 --> 01:06:11.42
Then now you have this image for the rest of your life.

860
01:06:11.42 --> 01:06:18.62
There was intense fighting in a place called Surgey and the usual atrocity stories.

861
01:06:18.62 --> 01:06:20.58
We heard many of them.

862
01:06:20.58 --> 01:06:23.10
They went something like this.

863
01:06:23.10 --> 01:06:29.18
A two-year-old girl got in the way of a marching column of German troops, a soldier bayonet

864
01:06:29.18 --> 01:06:33.94
at it and carried it away on his bayonet.

865
01:06:33.94 --> 01:06:36.70
Children were slaughtered for no apparent motive.

866
01:06:36.70 --> 01:06:41.66
The soldiers tied up civilian prisoners, prodded them with bayonets, put lit cigarettes

867
01:06:41.66 --> 01:06:44.74
in their noses and ears and shot them.

868
01:06:44.74 --> 01:06:47.50
Eyes were burned out with red hot pokers.

869
01:06:47.50 --> 01:06:51.38
Civilian snipers were tortured in every possible way.

870
01:06:51.38 --> 01:06:56.18
In Vameo, they had been spread eagled in the public square.

871
01:06:56.18 --> 01:07:02.42
A rat would be placed under an iron kettle upon the man or woman's bare abdomen, then

872
01:07:02.42 --> 01:07:05.50
a fire bill atop the kettle.

873
01:07:05.50 --> 01:07:10.26
The victim was tortured first by the frantic running around of the rat on his or her bare

874
01:07:10.26 --> 01:07:15.06
abdomen when it became nearly smothered and terror-stricken and pain filled from the smoke

875
01:07:15.06 --> 01:07:24.42
and heat, then it would eat down through the body of the humans living flesh to escape.

876
01:07:24.42 --> 01:07:27.50
We found the dead body of a girl.

877
01:07:27.50 --> 01:07:31.98
Her arms were nailed to the door and extended fashion, her left breast was half cut

878
01:07:31.98 --> 01:07:32.98
away.

879
01:07:32.98 --> 01:07:38.54
A young boy of five or six years of age lay on a doorstep with his two hands nearly

880
01:07:38.54 --> 01:07:42.98
severed from his arms but still hanging to them.

881
01:07:42.98 --> 01:07:48.34
At another place where the dead bodies of a man and woman are a girl and a boy.

882
01:07:48.34 --> 01:07:53.70
Each of them had both hands cut off at the wrists and both feet above the ankle.

883
01:07:53.70 --> 01:07:55.70
Child of seven beheaded.

884
01:07:55.70 --> 01:07:59.78
A whole family killed, including a young girl because the girl would not give herself

885
01:07:59.78 --> 01:08:02.66
to the Germans.

886
01:08:02.66 --> 01:08:07.06
One to death in their houses, all the women violated.

887
01:08:07.06 --> 01:08:12.38
The entire German regiment drunk, etc.

888
01:08:12.38 --> 01:08:17.34
The above are exact quotations from the Bryce report which specialized in outrageous

889
01:08:17.34 --> 01:08:20.46
against women and children.

890
01:08:20.46 --> 01:08:26.82
They are samples of the sort of stories we were always hearing.

891
01:08:26.82 --> 01:08:37.10
He goes on to say that he never saw personally these things, but this is the kind of things

892
01:08:37.10 --> 01:08:46.90
that they heard about happening all the time.

893
01:08:46.90 --> 01:08:49.42
They are getting ready for another counter attack.

894
01:08:49.42 --> 01:08:54.22
A court counsel for war brought the decision that we would cross the bridge in daylight.

895
01:08:54.22 --> 01:09:00.94
Then got ready to move and we prepared to rush across the bridge three or four at a time.

896
01:09:00.94 --> 01:09:06.82
The ranks of every company had been decimated and probably are outfit consisted of only

897
01:09:06.82 --> 01:09:10.62
four or five hundred men instead of the full strength one thousand men there should have

898
01:09:10.62 --> 01:09:15.46
been.

899
01:09:15.46 --> 01:09:20.22
There were dead Germans all around, but I could see one particularly well.

900
01:09:20.22 --> 01:09:25.58
He had been coming up the street past one of the garden walls and had been hit with a shell.

901
01:09:25.58 --> 01:09:29.58
His legs were laying on this side of the wall.

902
01:09:29.58 --> 01:09:34.90
We're lying there like they had been taking from some gigantic frog while on the other

903
01:09:34.90 --> 01:09:37.46
side of the wall, the hole the shell made.

904
01:09:37.46 --> 01:09:39.98
I could see the rest of his body.

905
01:09:39.98 --> 01:09:46.30
He was a powerful appearing man in his early 20s with a thick shock of blonde hair.

906
01:09:46.30 --> 01:09:48.86
His eyes were wide open.

907
01:09:48.86 --> 01:09:53.02
He never knew what hit him.

908
01:09:53.02 --> 01:09:56.70
About the middle of the afternoon the Germans tried another counter attack and we helped

909
01:09:56.70 --> 01:10:01.50
the defenders behind the barricade and in the houses farther up the street by sniping from

910
01:10:01.50 --> 01:10:04.86
the second floor of the houses we occupied.

911
01:10:04.86 --> 01:10:10.90
We were prepared to stop the attack if it had penetrated down the street to our positions.

912
01:10:10.90 --> 01:10:15.30
Firing over the heads of men behind the barricade we were able to assist in stopping this

913
01:10:15.30 --> 01:10:17.58
counter attack.

914
01:10:17.58 --> 01:10:21.74
The Germans too had their snipers to cover the advance of their men.

915
01:10:21.74 --> 01:10:27.42
I remember one who was firing very carefully from a window in a house well up the street.

916
01:10:27.42 --> 01:10:33.38
I took careful aim and he fell forward out of the window.

917
01:10:33.38 --> 01:10:40.14
During all this fighting the air was filled with dust and with the fumes of powder.

918
01:10:40.14 --> 01:10:43.94
They burnt our noses, throats and lungs to such an extent that we could not tell

919
01:10:43.94 --> 01:10:52.58
if gas was in the air and at this point they're trying to make progress and they get caught

920
01:10:52.58 --> 01:11:00.34
in a horrible crossfire flanking fire.

921
01:11:00.34 --> 01:11:05.38
Frontal fire is bad enough but flanking fire is suicidal.

922
01:11:05.38 --> 01:11:07.06
Men were getting hit all around us.

923
01:11:07.06 --> 01:11:11.62
They were calling for stretches trying to apply their own first aid kits on every side and

924
01:11:11.62 --> 01:11:16.50
some of them were gasping out their last breaths.

925
01:11:16.50 --> 01:11:23.30
To come so far at least 4,000 miles and to have their lives snuffed out so warmly, so

926
01:11:23.30 --> 01:11:28.46
uselessly behind this wall and the backyards of a remote French village that the world

927
01:11:28.46 --> 01:11:35.50
would never have heard of were at not for the action which took place there.

928
01:11:35.50 --> 01:11:45.50
This defense that they make of this village kind of comes down to one final situation

929
01:11:45.50 --> 01:11:55.02
that they're in, they're holed up and they're about to be attacked by the Germans.

930
01:11:55.02 --> 01:11:59.74
Some gas had fallen which added to the pain and bleeding of the wounded and proved to

931
01:11:59.74 --> 01:12:08.66
us that no hell in the hair after could be greater than this man made hell that we were enduring.

932
01:12:08.66 --> 01:12:13.54
Men began to go out of their heads shell shocked if we could call it that or just crazy

933
01:12:13.54 --> 01:12:22.86
from weakness, strain, suffering and hungry hunger with all bed death around them.

934
01:12:22.86 --> 01:12:27.18
It was near the breaking point for all of us who survived.

935
01:12:27.18 --> 01:12:34.62
We would ask ourselves how can there be any more but there was more and worse.

936
01:12:34.62 --> 01:12:39.26
The night war on and the morning of the fifth day was about to break.

937
01:12:39.26 --> 01:12:42.06
The German artillery speeded up again.

938
01:12:42.06 --> 01:12:44.94
We knew that an attack was impending.

939
01:12:44.94 --> 01:12:47.54
Everywhere I looked were dead men.

940
01:12:47.54 --> 01:12:51.90
There seemed to be no lifemen around to man the guns.

941
01:12:51.90 --> 01:12:56.54
Here they come with shout at along the line and many of the nearly dead men rose up to

942
01:12:56.54 --> 01:13:01.62
the man their guns behind the wall that had become almost a part of us.

943
01:13:01.62 --> 01:13:08.38
Wave after wave of Germans were coming through the pair, the pair orchard, rifles, hand grenades

944
01:13:08.38 --> 01:13:10.90
and machine guns.

945
01:13:10.90 --> 01:13:14.70
But worst of all, the flame throwers.

946
01:13:14.70 --> 01:13:16.50
I could see the men plainly.

947
01:13:16.50 --> 01:13:21.58
They had tanks on their backs and from the ends of their hoses came great masses of liquid

948
01:13:21.58 --> 01:13:26.66
fire shooting toward us at a distance of at least 50 yards.

949
01:13:26.66 --> 01:13:29.98
The smoke went far beyond us.

950
01:13:29.98 --> 01:13:33.66
We felt that they heat would burn us up.

951
01:13:33.66 --> 01:13:39.78
Every man able to fire concentrated upon the men who were operating the flame throwers.

952
01:13:39.78 --> 01:13:42.74
Almost immediately they were put out of action.

953
01:13:42.74 --> 01:13:48.34
Their tanks perforated and each man's body of mass of flames.

954
01:13:48.34 --> 01:13:53.14
The flames leaped and shot into the air.

955
01:13:53.14 --> 01:13:59.66
Thus was the attack stopped by the Germans' own diabolical weapon.

956
01:13:59.66 --> 01:14:03.46
They suffered far more than we.

957
01:14:03.46 --> 01:14:10.66
Never after that in the war did we encounter that type of flame thrower again.

958
01:14:10.66 --> 01:14:13.90
They were the real suicide squad.

959
01:14:13.90 --> 01:14:21.66
The men who operated those tanks were sure to suffer a terrible and quick death.

960
01:14:21.66 --> 01:14:24.14
It was a narrow escape.

961
01:14:24.14 --> 01:14:27.86
There were just a handful of us left.

962
01:14:27.86 --> 01:14:34.22
When we were relieved that night and staggered across the river, there were just 32 of us

963
01:14:34.22 --> 01:14:36.26
left.

964
01:14:36.26 --> 01:14:42.78
Our companies on the line were almost completely wiped out.

965
01:14:42.78 --> 01:14:48.14
But we had held the line.

966
01:14:48.14 --> 01:14:52.46
They held the line.

967
01:14:52.46 --> 01:15:02.70
And an unfathomable cost in blood and sanity and lives.

968
01:15:02.70 --> 01:15:07.98
They held the line.

969
01:15:07.98 --> 01:15:17.42
And men like Bob Hoffman who met face to face with hell and evil and darkness that

970
01:15:17.42 --> 01:15:22.46
crushes youth and laughter.

971
01:15:22.46 --> 01:15:30.74
And for many people it crushes hope.

972
01:15:30.74 --> 01:15:37.74
The Bob Hoffman overcame all of that.

973
01:15:37.74 --> 01:15:47.86
And really from my perspective, through fitness, he led an incredible life.

974
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:50.54
And he ended up writing a book about it.

975
01:15:50.54 --> 01:15:57.50
And it was called How to Be Strong, Healthy and Happy.

976
01:15:57.50 --> 01:15:59.74
And that's a tall order.

977
01:15:59.74 --> 01:16:06.74
Who doesn't want to be strong, healthy and happy.

978
01:16:06.74 --> 01:16:10.26
And the book, it's some of its day to much of it isn't.

979
01:16:10.26 --> 01:16:12.50
But some of its day to much of it isn't.

980
01:16:12.50 --> 01:16:15.46
But I don't want to go deep into the book.

981
01:16:15.46 --> 01:16:20.98
But I do want to hit some of my highlights from this book on how to be strong, healthy,

982
01:16:20.98 --> 01:16:23.10
and happy.

983
01:16:23.10 --> 01:16:31.10
And things to think about.

984
01:16:31.10 --> 01:16:38.70
Bob Hoffman, hero from World War I who'd been through hell.

985
01:16:38.70 --> 01:16:47.90
I'm just going to read some quotes from this, physical training pays.

986
01:16:47.90 --> 01:16:56.42
I always say that any exercise is better than no exercise.

987
01:16:56.42 --> 01:16:59.50
Now he talks about sleep a little bit.

988
01:16:59.50 --> 01:17:06.62
And those folks out there that harass me on Twitter, docked parsley, constantly harassing

989
01:17:06.62 --> 01:17:11.02
me on Twitter, telling me to sleep more.

990
01:17:11.02 --> 01:17:13.90
This is what Bob Hoffman had to say about sleep.

991
01:17:13.90 --> 01:17:19.66
There are different speeds of sleep, some sleep faster than others.

992
01:17:19.66 --> 01:17:24.30
And can awake refreshed with a moderate number of hours of sleep, which would leave others

993
01:17:24.30 --> 01:17:28.78
tired and warm.

994
01:17:28.78 --> 01:17:34.22
Fast sleeping is a result of properly operating bodily functions of perfect functioning

995
01:17:34.22 --> 01:17:36.46
of all organs.

996
01:17:36.46 --> 01:17:44.06
And it comes to from a customing the body to an hour to less sleep.

997
01:17:44.06 --> 01:17:47.98
Many great men of history are reported to have slept only a fraction of the time that

998
01:17:47.98 --> 01:17:51.90
the average person spends sleeping.

999
01:17:51.90 --> 01:17:56.06
It was said that Thomas Edison, the world famous inventor, would sleep up four hours

1000
01:17:56.06 --> 01:17:57.38
a night.

1001
01:17:57.38 --> 01:18:01.86
But he had a cot in his laboratory on which you would lie and think in his assistants

1002
01:18:01.86 --> 01:18:05.98
of reported he took naps during the day.

1003
01:18:05.98 --> 01:18:10.78
He men who are reported to sleep up four hours and I will make up for it with naps during

1004
01:18:10.78 --> 01:18:13.02
day light hours.

1005
01:18:13.02 --> 01:18:16.98
So there you go, you're good to go.

1006
01:18:16.98 --> 01:18:17.98
That's all you need to do.

1007
01:18:17.98 --> 01:18:22.10
Sleep faster.

1008
01:18:22.10 --> 01:18:23.98
Talk to you echo.

1009
01:18:23.98 --> 01:18:26.98
What do you get nine hours, ten hours?

1010
01:18:26.98 --> 01:18:27.98
No.

1011
01:18:27.98 --> 01:18:28.98
Regular eight, I think.

1012
01:18:28.98 --> 01:18:29.98
Nice.

1013
01:18:29.98 --> 01:18:32.98
Sleep faster.

1014
01:18:32.98 --> 01:18:37.78
Now speaking to that, too much sleep is not a benefit.

1015
01:18:37.78 --> 01:18:45.94
Rather it is depressing causes sluggishness and a state of authority.

1016
01:18:45.94 --> 01:18:49.22
I like that too much sleep.

1017
01:18:49.22 --> 01:18:53.74
Take that, take that dock parsley out there.

1018
01:18:53.74 --> 01:18:56.22
But you know, do you know, dock parsley?

1019
01:18:56.22 --> 01:18:57.22
He tried it.

1020
01:18:57.22 --> 01:18:58.22
He tried it.

1021
01:18:58.22 --> 01:19:03.14
He's a doctor, but he's he's done a lot of stuff with sleep and studying sleep and

1022
01:19:03.14 --> 01:19:04.14
he's always giving me a hard time.

1023
01:19:04.14 --> 01:19:05.58
Because sleep is good for you.

1024
01:19:05.58 --> 01:19:07.14
I'm only kidding everybody.

1025
01:19:07.14 --> 01:19:08.34
Sleep is definitely good for you.

1026
01:19:08.34 --> 01:19:09.74
I should sleep more.

1027
01:19:09.74 --> 01:19:11.10
I just have a hard time doing it.

1028
01:19:11.10 --> 01:19:13.02
There's so much to be done in the world.

1029
01:19:13.02 --> 01:19:14.38
And you're sleeping fast.

1030
01:19:14.38 --> 01:19:17.14
And I am sleeping a little faster than everybody else.

1031
01:19:17.14 --> 01:19:21.74
Another quote.

1032
01:19:21.74 --> 01:19:27.06
Any young man who desires to obtain the most from life should spend a good portion of his

1033
01:19:27.06 --> 01:19:31.38
time improving himself physically.

1034
01:19:31.38 --> 01:19:35.66
Regardless of your age, you just make it a rule to learn something new each day and to

1035
01:19:35.66 --> 01:19:38.30
do something each day to improve yourself physically.

1036
01:19:38.30 --> 01:19:42.18
So he's talking about mental and physical strength.

1037
01:19:42.18 --> 01:19:48.02
He's talking about learning stuff, memorizing stuff, doing math in your head.

1038
01:19:48.02 --> 01:19:49.30
Just getting smarter.

1039
01:19:49.30 --> 01:19:53.66
I believe we talk about that sometime.

1040
01:19:53.66 --> 01:19:58.14
The best hobby of all physical training, concentrate on your activities and set a

1041
01:19:58.14 --> 01:20:03.94
worrying about the future, welcome the opportunity to face problems or deals or battles of

1042
01:20:03.94 --> 01:20:07.22
your life.

1043
01:20:07.22 --> 01:20:13.14
You can build yourself so that you obtain pleasure from overcoming from defeating problems

1044
01:20:13.14 --> 01:20:16.86
apparently in surmountable difficulties.

1045
01:20:16.86 --> 01:20:20.10
You can overcome all your difficulties in win.

1046
01:20:20.10 --> 01:20:23.06
You will find the next encounter easier.

1047
01:20:23.06 --> 01:20:28.50
You will have greater confidence in your own ability.

1048
01:20:28.50 --> 01:20:29.50
God problems.

1049
01:20:29.50 --> 01:20:30.50
Good.

1050
01:20:30.50 --> 01:20:34.10
Let's face them.

1051
01:20:34.10 --> 01:20:39.42
And actually, I forgot to mention this, but this book, I remember the last war.

1052
01:20:39.42 --> 01:20:40.94
I got from somebody on Twitter.

1053
01:20:40.94 --> 01:20:43.14
And I'm sorry, hey, everybody on Twitter.

1054
01:20:43.14 --> 01:20:47.06
Number one, I don't know if people want to be mentioned or not.

1055
01:20:47.06 --> 01:20:52.58
And also when I transfer what people tell me to the document that I keep, it doesn't

1056
01:20:52.58 --> 01:20:56.10
pull their names, so they're just lost.

1057
01:20:56.10 --> 01:20:59.94
But usually people hit me up afterwards and say, oh, I gave you that book.

1058
01:20:59.94 --> 01:21:01.82
So somebody recommended the book to me.

1059
01:21:01.82 --> 01:21:03.02
I remember the last war.

1060
01:21:03.02 --> 01:21:08.10
And once I started doing some research about Bob Hoffman, and I saw he had another book that

1061
01:21:08.10 --> 01:21:11.54
was literally called How to Be Strong, Helping an Appie.

1062
01:21:11.54 --> 01:21:13.46
I just ordered immediately.

1063
01:21:13.46 --> 01:21:19.66
So I can see what he had to say about it all.

1064
01:21:19.66 --> 01:21:25.58
And I think he has some pretty good information.

1065
01:21:25.58 --> 01:21:27.02
Here's another quote.

1066
01:21:27.02 --> 01:21:30.94
People who know nothing of the pleasures and advantages of having super strength and health

1067
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:34.66
often say what good are muscles.

1068
01:21:34.66 --> 01:21:38.30
They say they have your no use for them that they are healthy.

1069
01:21:38.30 --> 01:21:42.90
But they are only half alive in many cases, for they will never have felt the indescribable

1070
01:21:42.90 --> 01:21:49.18
sense of power and well being, the sense of superiority or capability that strong persons

1071
01:21:49.18 --> 01:21:50.62
feel.

1072
01:21:50.62 --> 01:21:55.82
Many youths have eliminated an inferiority complex by the growing knowledge of the power

1073
01:21:55.82 --> 01:22:02.78
they possess by their physical ability or superiority over average persons.

1074
01:22:02.78 --> 01:22:05.58
We might have to do an ego check here, Bob.

1075
01:22:05.58 --> 01:22:06.94
I'm not sure.

1076
01:22:06.94 --> 01:22:09.10
But actually he's going to ego check it right here himself.

1077
01:22:09.10 --> 01:22:14.46
I do not mean by this that strong men should go around bullying others by demonstrating

1078
01:22:14.46 --> 01:22:16.58
their strength.

1079
01:22:16.58 --> 01:22:22.38
As an actual fact, a stronger and more capable man, the less likely he is to make a

1080
01:22:22.38 --> 01:22:26.86
show of his strength by hurting or fighting others.

1081
01:22:26.86 --> 01:22:32.58
But strength of mind and body does be get confidence to termination, perseverance and

1082
01:22:32.58 --> 01:22:36.94
many other admirable qualities.

1083
01:22:36.94 --> 01:22:40.74
So I think he brought it back around again.

1084
01:22:40.74 --> 01:22:45.94
And as for you know, we're talking before the podcast started about how some people, if

1085
01:22:45.94 --> 01:22:49.98
they're a little bit insecure, but they want to be a tough guy, they got to act like

1086
01:22:49.98 --> 01:22:50.98
that.

1087
01:22:50.98 --> 01:22:54.70
And when you're looking at them kind of like this guy, it must not be that tough because

1088
01:22:54.70 --> 01:22:55.90
you got to act this way.

1089
01:22:55.90 --> 01:23:00.62
So they actually are getting less respect than they think they are.

1090
01:23:00.62 --> 01:23:04.30
But if they actually had confidence in their situation, if they knew that they could

1091
01:23:04.30 --> 01:23:12.90
hand themselves, they wouldn't be acting like that.

1092
01:23:12.90 --> 01:23:19.30
Here's another little something to think about.

1093
01:23:19.30 --> 01:23:22.78
Don't worry about things that might happen.

1094
01:23:22.78 --> 01:23:27.18
Work hard and do the best you can and if something happens, it can't be helped.

1095
01:23:27.18 --> 01:23:28.18
Don't give up.

1096
01:23:28.18 --> 01:23:30.70
Never cry over spilled milk.

1097
01:23:30.70 --> 01:23:32.34
What is done is done.

1098
01:23:32.34 --> 01:23:34.70
It can't be helped when it's too late.

1099
01:23:34.70 --> 01:23:41.62
I have survived some apparently overwhelming difficulties easily enough with this point of view.

1100
01:23:41.62 --> 01:23:43.50
What are your basic?

1101
01:23:43.50 --> 01:23:46.90
I mean, no use crying over spilled milk.

1102
01:23:46.90 --> 01:23:47.90
Yeah.

1103
01:23:47.90 --> 01:23:51.98
Don't abuse that one though because you know how, you know, people will have that attitude,

1104
01:23:51.98 --> 01:23:57.70
but then sometimes they'll let it overflow and it'll get, it'll make itself.

1105
01:23:57.70 --> 01:24:02.62
They'll allow it to be an excuse to go, yeah, I don't prepared.

1106
01:24:02.62 --> 01:24:04.74
Yeah, no, that's not a good idea.

1107
01:24:04.74 --> 01:24:08.86
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it can do it, you know, because it's like a, there might be a small

1108
01:24:08.86 --> 01:24:12.50
gray area, you know, because they're like, oh, I don't really care that much about the outcome.

1109
01:24:12.50 --> 01:24:14.06
What's going to happen is going to happen.

1110
01:24:14.06 --> 01:24:18.30
So they might, like I said, overflow into their part of their mind of preparation.

1111
01:24:18.30 --> 01:24:19.90
Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't want to let that happen.

1112
01:24:19.90 --> 01:24:24.46
Yeah, so you know, because the opposite is like, if you obsess over the outcome, you might

1113
01:24:24.46 --> 01:24:25.86
obsess over the preparation.

1114
01:24:25.86 --> 01:24:30.38
Maybe, you know what I mean, that's, that's those kind of go hand in hand a little bit.

1115
01:24:30.38 --> 01:24:32.78
So if you go the opposite, you know, you can get that.

1116
01:24:32.78 --> 01:24:35.06
Be like, yeah, whatever is going to happen is going to happen.

1117
01:24:35.06 --> 01:24:36.06
So whatever.

1118
01:24:36.06 --> 01:24:37.78
That's not the excuse we're looking for.

1119
01:24:37.78 --> 01:24:41.82
No, no, no, no, no, that's not the same be careful with that, you know.

1120
01:24:41.82 --> 01:24:44.10
Here we go.

1121
01:24:44.10 --> 01:24:45.10
A few more of these.

1122
01:24:45.10 --> 01:24:50.34
If you want to live long and be healthy, strong and happy, acquire habits of activity

1123
01:24:50.34 --> 01:24:57.14
right now, if you are tempted to sit in an easy chair, find something to keep you busy.

1124
01:24:57.14 --> 01:25:02.10
A few minutes to a half an hour with the weights will be best.

1125
01:25:02.10 --> 01:25:06.42
If you find yourself going to the garage for your car to get to the grocery store, walk

1126
01:25:06.42 --> 01:25:08.46
instead.

1127
01:25:08.46 --> 01:25:09.66
I like this one right here.

1128
01:25:09.66 --> 01:25:14.98
If you don't feel like getting dressed to go out, do it anyways.

1129
01:25:14.98 --> 01:25:19.62
Instead of lying down after a meal, find something to do.

1130
01:25:19.62 --> 01:25:22.02
Don't pass the buck as they say in the army.

1131
01:25:22.02 --> 01:25:25.54
Do it yourself if it involves muscular action.

1132
01:25:25.54 --> 01:25:31.66
Clean off the snow, cut the grass, spade the garden.

1133
01:25:31.66 --> 01:25:33.46
That's a good one.

1134
01:25:33.46 --> 01:25:36.98
That's just a general rule.

1135
01:25:36.98 --> 01:25:41.30
If you don't feel like something, because you're being lazy, just do it.

1136
01:25:41.30 --> 01:25:42.30
Don't be lazy.

1137
01:25:42.30 --> 01:25:45.34
The thing that you could do tomorrow, do it today.

1138
01:25:45.34 --> 01:25:50.18
Do that thing today.

1139
01:25:50.18 --> 01:25:51.46
Otherwise you get this.

1140
01:25:51.46 --> 01:25:57.14
If you put off until another day, your good intentions to normalize your body, it won't

1141
01:25:57.14 --> 01:25:58.78
help.

1142
01:25:58.78 --> 01:26:05.78
The road to despair and unhappiness is paved with good intentions lost along the way.

1143
01:26:05.78 --> 01:26:08.74
I think you just say and get after it.

1144
01:26:08.74 --> 01:26:10.38
Basically is what I'm getting.

1145
01:26:10.38 --> 01:26:15.34
That's what I'm getting from ball-off-man.

1146
01:26:15.34 --> 01:26:17.42
This is just a old school.

1147
01:26:17.42 --> 01:26:19.66
Disemold school knowledge right here.

1148
01:26:19.66 --> 01:26:26.98
If our country was invaded and our young men were a lot of cream puffs, probably cowards,

1149
01:26:26.98 --> 01:26:31.98
through never having experienced hard work, athletic competition or a good punch in the

1150
01:26:31.98 --> 01:26:39.18
nose, we would lose to the invaders, lose our freedoms, and things worth more than life

1151
01:26:39.18 --> 01:26:40.18
itself.

1152
01:26:40.18 --> 01:26:42.18
So she's basically saying, be harder.

1153
01:26:42.18 --> 01:26:43.18
Tough enough.

1154
01:26:43.18 --> 01:26:44.18
The tougher.

1155
01:26:44.18 --> 01:26:48.58
I support this idea, 100%.

1156
01:26:48.58 --> 01:26:50.70
Two things that make you tougher and better.

1157
01:26:50.70 --> 01:26:52.70
Yes.

1158
01:26:52.70 --> 01:26:56.66
The only thing that makes you feel like you're going to be as life stagnation is death in life.

1159
01:26:56.66 --> 01:26:58.06
There is movement.

1160
01:26:58.06 --> 01:27:04.94
These are all well-known trueisms and exercise, bringing helpful activity to every organ,

1161
01:27:04.94 --> 01:27:11.38
gland, and cell of the body keeps the entire body and mind radiantly alive and with

1162
01:27:11.38 --> 01:27:16.74
a feeling of pep energy and well-being that makes one so buoyant and alive that they feel

1163
01:27:16.74 --> 01:27:18.54
like jumping and running.

1164
01:27:18.54 --> 01:27:24.46
Oh, he's fired up.

1165
01:27:24.46 --> 01:27:27.10
Exercise builds coordination balance control of the muscles.

1166
01:27:27.10 --> 01:27:30.58
It builds speed, judgment of time and space and distance.

1167
01:27:30.58 --> 01:27:35.46
Makes the entire body more responsive to the will, and it teaches the body to do the right

1168
01:27:35.46 --> 01:27:41.10
thing in times of danger even before it is directed by the mind.

1169
01:27:41.10 --> 01:27:44.94
Exercise is the best insurance against disease or sickness.

1170
01:27:44.94 --> 01:27:49.18
Exercise builds confident for there is no road to supreme confidence as sure as the knowledge

1171
01:27:49.18 --> 01:27:52.78
of one's physical and mental ability.

1172
01:27:52.78 --> 01:27:57.78
It cultivates power of will, gives you complete mastery of your physical and mental self,

1173
01:27:57.78 --> 01:28:04.26
promotes personal efficiency and all desirable mental characteristics.

1174
01:28:04.26 --> 01:28:08.86
Exercise improves the efficiency of every part of the body.

1175
01:28:08.86 --> 01:28:14.42
It helps you sleep sounder and faster so that you have more time for work and pleasure.

1176
01:28:14.42 --> 01:28:20.66
Makes it possible for you to earn more.

1177
01:28:20.66 --> 01:28:24.26
Exercise makes it possible to live more.

1178
01:28:24.26 --> 01:28:29.74
Exercise will only take one tenth of the time you now spend on foolish expenditures of

1179
01:28:29.74 --> 01:28:33.34
time and energy.

1180
01:28:33.34 --> 01:28:37.14
This is funny because this is written in like 1930 something.

1181
01:28:37.14 --> 01:28:43.98
Now you have time to sit around to read for entertainment too often, true detective stories,

1182
01:28:43.98 --> 01:28:49.86
other two stories which do you know good, but merely tell you of the troubles of others.

1183
01:28:49.86 --> 01:28:54.70
You spend a lot of time at the movies perhaps or listening to the radio in idle talk

1184
01:28:54.70 --> 01:29:00.98
or gossip in watching athletic events which put which others put forth effort and receive

1185
01:29:00.98 --> 01:29:03.34
physical benefit.

1186
01:29:03.34 --> 01:29:09.46
You know, add the interweb into that equation and social media and you've got no time

1187
01:29:09.46 --> 01:29:10.46
in the day.

1188
01:29:10.46 --> 01:29:15.22
It's essentially internet is basically all that.

1189
01:29:15.22 --> 01:29:16.22
All that without moving.

1190
01:29:16.22 --> 01:29:19.86
All that just with your thumbs.

1191
01:29:19.86 --> 01:29:23.98
So it's sure that you can find time for exercise to obtain much of what is worth in life.

1192
01:29:23.98 --> 01:29:26.18
You must find time.

1193
01:29:26.18 --> 01:29:32.22
Your health demands it.

1194
01:29:32.22 --> 01:29:37.62
I'm going to wrap it up right here with this one.

1195
01:29:37.62 --> 01:29:42.66
But probably you have done as the majority do.

1196
01:29:42.66 --> 01:29:47.58
Drift it along from day to day promising yourself that you would start exercising tomorrow

1197
01:29:47.58 --> 01:29:52.82
or next week or next month when the weather becomes cooler.

1198
01:29:52.82 --> 01:29:58.70
Tomorrow comes, next week and next month, cool weather and even next year comes and goes

1199
01:29:58.70 --> 01:30:01.22
and you do nothing about it.

1200
01:30:01.22 --> 01:30:06.62
After years of thinking about exercise but not acting, you find the firm rounded attractive

1201
01:30:06.62 --> 01:30:12.34
muscles of your youth have changed into the weak and soft muscles of middle age.

1202
01:30:12.34 --> 01:30:17.82
You take on a little excess flesh and make mental note some night when you gaze upon yourself

1203
01:30:17.82 --> 01:30:22.10
in the mirror that you'll have to do something, cut down on starches or sweets, get more

1204
01:30:22.10 --> 01:30:23.10
exercise.

1205
01:30:23.10 --> 01:30:28.66
But you've developed an enormous appetite during these years and at best you refrain from eating

1206
01:30:28.66 --> 01:30:31.26
sweets for a day or two.

1207
01:30:31.26 --> 01:30:36.54
It seems that all the things you like are the best fat producers.

1208
01:30:36.54 --> 01:30:38.90
You can't give them up.

1209
01:30:38.90 --> 01:30:40.94
You notice you don't have endurance anymore.

1210
01:30:40.94 --> 01:30:43.34
You get tired after you walk to block or two.

1211
01:30:43.34 --> 01:30:45.58
Your wind isn't as good as it used to be.

1212
01:30:45.58 --> 01:30:48.98
Remember last night how you puffed when you ran for the street car.

1213
01:30:48.98 --> 01:30:52.34
Remember how it made you blow to carry you.

1214
01:30:52.34 --> 01:30:55.18
That empty trunk up to the attic.

1215
01:30:55.18 --> 01:31:01.18
Your tailor pokes you good naturedly when he's fitting your suit and remarks that the

1216
01:31:01.18 --> 01:31:06.06
fat is piling on and your waist is increasing by inches.

1217
01:31:06.06 --> 01:31:08.86
These are all reasons why you should exercise.

1218
01:31:08.86 --> 01:31:10.30
It's not too late now.

1219
01:31:10.30 --> 01:31:14.82
It's never too late as long as you were able to be around to exercise and improve yourself

1220
01:31:14.82 --> 01:31:16.70
physically.

1221
01:31:16.70 --> 01:31:21.50
Man of all ages receive quick results from proper physical training.

1222
01:31:21.50 --> 01:31:29.50
It's never too late to make corrections in your mode of living.

1223
01:31:29.50 --> 01:31:31.14
Some classic stuff there.

1224
01:31:31.14 --> 01:31:33.82
There's a little caveat there with, you know, how he says it's never too late.

1225
01:31:33.82 --> 01:31:34.82
That's true.

1226
01:31:34.82 --> 01:31:35.82
That's true.

1227
01:31:35.82 --> 01:31:44.34
But the more time that you have spent getting into shape, you can fall out of shape.

1228
01:31:44.34 --> 01:31:47.94
And when you come back to it, it'll be way easier.

1229
01:31:47.94 --> 01:31:49.70
And I mentioned this before.

1230
01:31:49.70 --> 01:31:50.70
That's cool.

1231
01:31:50.70 --> 01:31:53.22
You can, you can keep telling yourself that.

1232
01:31:53.22 --> 01:31:57.46
I'm telling you, if let's say you're right, you want to have a good base.

1233
01:31:57.46 --> 01:32:01.82
If you have a good base of being strong, it's going to be easier for you than somebody

1234
01:32:01.82 --> 01:32:03.58
somebody that's never worked out before.

1235
01:32:03.58 --> 01:32:04.98
Yes, that's a given.

1236
01:32:04.98 --> 01:32:09.98
Being said, if you take a person that's never lifted before, never worked out before, when

1237
01:32:09.98 --> 01:32:11.98
they start, they make all kinds of crazy gains.

1238
01:32:11.98 --> 01:32:12.98
Right?

1239
01:32:12.98 --> 01:32:13.98
Yeah.

1240
01:32:13.98 --> 01:32:17.22
But keep in mind, they're still starting at the bottom of the ladder.

1241
01:32:17.22 --> 01:32:21.42
So yeah, the first 10 steps on the ladder come quickly, quickly.

1242
01:32:21.42 --> 01:32:24.66
But that comes for everybody, give her, give her, give her, give her.

1243
01:32:24.66 --> 01:32:26.66
So sure.

1244
01:32:26.66 --> 01:32:27.66
Okay.

1245
01:32:27.66 --> 01:32:31.34
In the small little picture, you can be like, hey, that guy, he started on the first

1246
01:32:31.34 --> 01:32:33.30
10 steps of the ladder way later in life.

1247
01:32:33.30 --> 01:32:34.94
So look at his gains way later in life.

1248
01:32:34.94 --> 01:32:39.42
But meanwhile, you had those first steps done 35 years ago.

1249
01:32:39.42 --> 01:32:42.70
You're going to step 125 right now.

1250
01:32:42.70 --> 01:32:44.02
You are correct.

1251
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:47.54
The bottom line is both groups will benefit.

1252
01:32:47.54 --> 01:32:48.54
Oh, yeah.

1253
01:32:48.54 --> 01:32:49.54
Feet time.

1254
01:32:49.54 --> 01:32:50.54
Physical activity.

1255
01:32:50.54 --> 01:32:54.06
And so the point being, you know, how any mentions this, how it's like, oh, I'll just

1256
01:32:54.06 --> 01:32:57.98
do it tomorrow or I'll just do it, you know, the New Year's resolution or whatever.

1257
01:32:57.98 --> 01:33:02.90
The more time you spend not doing it, the harder it is to get there and stay there.

1258
01:33:02.90 --> 01:33:06.86
Because man, you know, though, I actually have a theory on this too.

1259
01:33:06.86 --> 01:33:12.50
Like, if you miss a workout, you can never make it up.

1260
01:33:12.50 --> 01:33:13.50
It's gone.

1261
01:33:13.50 --> 01:33:15.22
Like, it's like, it's gone.

1262
01:33:15.22 --> 01:33:16.22
You can never make it.

1263
01:33:16.22 --> 01:33:17.58
Because you worked out the next day.

1264
01:33:17.58 --> 01:33:21.26
But no, no, you missed the day that you, that was supposed to be a different workout.

1265
01:33:21.26 --> 01:33:22.26
Right.

1266
01:33:22.26 --> 01:33:24.50
You know, we can't get it back.

1267
01:33:24.50 --> 01:33:26.66
Now sometimes you need a break.

1268
01:33:26.66 --> 01:33:27.66
Right.

1269
01:33:27.66 --> 01:33:29.10
Then, well, I think we got some questions about that.

1270
01:33:29.10 --> 01:33:33.06
So now you definitely need a rest that you're push your body so hard.

1271
01:33:33.06 --> 01:33:35.18
You do so much activity activity.

1272
01:33:35.18 --> 01:33:38.66
But you're not going to get that chance to work out again.

1273
01:33:38.66 --> 01:33:41.34
And you're not going to chance any time you waste any time in your life.

1274
01:33:41.34 --> 01:33:42.34
Guess what?

1275
01:33:42.34 --> 01:33:43.34
It's gone.

1276
01:33:43.34 --> 01:33:44.82
So don't waste it.

1277
01:33:44.82 --> 01:33:45.82
Don't waste it.

1278
01:33:45.82 --> 01:33:51.02
Don't waste it with sitting, listen to radio shows or internet shows or watching TV.

1279
01:33:51.02 --> 01:33:52.30
That's a waste.

1280
01:33:52.30 --> 01:33:53.30
Don't waste it with that.

1281
01:33:53.30 --> 01:33:55.30
Unless the shows are helping you.

1282
01:33:55.30 --> 01:33:56.30
Well, yeah.

1283
01:33:56.30 --> 01:33:58.62
Yes, if they're helping you if they're beneficial, if it's

1284
01:33:58.62 --> 01:34:02.14
a chocolate podcast, man, tune in.

1285
01:34:02.14 --> 01:34:08.78
But if you're seeing my reality, if you, oh, yeah, reality TV, just random social

1286
01:34:08.78 --> 01:34:11.86
media stuff that's not helping you get any better.

1287
01:34:11.86 --> 01:34:13.54
Of course, you're wasting it.

1288
01:34:13.54 --> 01:34:15.26
You're not going to get it back.

1289
01:34:15.26 --> 01:34:22.78
Sometimes if I miss something or if I'm lazy about something, that, that pisses me off.

1290
01:34:22.78 --> 01:34:26.94
And at the time, I'll say, oh, you know, I'll rationalize some excuses around it.

1291
01:34:26.94 --> 01:34:29.54
And then later, I'll say, what is your problem?

1292
01:34:29.54 --> 01:34:30.54
Why did you do that?

1293
01:34:30.54 --> 01:34:33.26
And then it's punishment time.

1294
01:34:33.26 --> 01:34:35.58
That it's, let's go get the squat rack.

1295
01:34:35.58 --> 01:34:37.30
Let's tell the pay for that.

1296
01:34:37.30 --> 01:34:43.62
Yeah, I think I'm going to put this real bluntly, almost to the point of ignorance.

1297
01:34:43.62 --> 01:34:49.42
But I think you value rest way less than a normal person.

1298
01:34:49.42 --> 01:34:52.42
I think I'm not going to argue with you.

1299
01:34:52.42 --> 01:34:59.94
Or it could be that you value the work part of it so much that your rest is quantity

1300
01:34:59.94 --> 01:35:03.62
wise less, but quality wise might be more.

1301
01:35:03.62 --> 01:35:04.62
Yeah.

1302
01:35:04.62 --> 01:35:08.34
And also, like, for instance, I don't get the opportunity.

1303
01:35:08.34 --> 01:35:13.74
I mean, when I travel, like for, for instance, when I travel, I barely, recently, I

1304
01:35:13.74 --> 01:35:17.18
have not had time to do digital, digital, and I'm traveling.

1305
01:35:17.18 --> 01:35:19.94
So when I'm back here, I got to just get it in.

1306
01:35:19.94 --> 01:35:23.98
You know, and if I miss it when I'm in San Diego, I'm not happy.

1307
01:35:23.98 --> 01:35:25.38
I'm angry at myself.

1308
01:35:25.38 --> 01:35:26.58
And I won't even let it happen.

1309
01:35:26.58 --> 01:35:28.34
I'm just not going to let it happen.

1310
01:35:28.34 --> 01:35:30.02
Even yesterday, I was all tired and beat up.

1311
01:35:30.02 --> 01:35:33.38
And I was like, OK, well, go train, all tired and beat up.

1312
01:35:33.38 --> 01:35:35.42
Because you can miss some days this week.

1313
01:35:35.42 --> 01:35:37.38
So you got to just go get it on.

1314
01:35:37.38 --> 01:35:41.30
Work on being weak and lame and getting your getting your game on.

1315
01:35:41.30 --> 01:35:43.82
I went rolled to the bunch of people and did what I normally do.

1316
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:44.82
And you know what?

1317
01:35:44.82 --> 01:35:47.98
By the time you're in the middle of a rolling, it doesn't matter anymore.

1318
01:35:47.98 --> 01:35:49.54
You're just dealing with a situation.

1319
01:35:49.54 --> 01:35:50.54
Yeah.

1320
01:35:50.54 --> 01:35:53.38
Man, if you can get to that point where you know, and you just

1321
01:35:53.38 --> 01:35:58.46
is kind of a weird one where it's really good, really, really good exercise.

1322
01:35:58.46 --> 01:36:00.46
But it's really, really fun to do.

1323
01:36:00.46 --> 01:36:01.46
Yes.

1324
01:36:01.46 --> 01:36:02.46
So it's like a win-win.

1325
01:36:02.46 --> 01:36:04.66
So weightlifting, I think it's like that.

1326
01:36:04.66 --> 01:36:05.94
But it's not like that for everybody.

1327
01:36:05.94 --> 01:36:08.06
It's like it's fun to actually do.

1328
01:36:08.06 --> 01:36:13.50
Even though sometimes you've got to build up the energy or whatever to,

1329
01:36:13.50 --> 01:36:15.42
motivation, whatever to do it.

1330
01:36:15.42 --> 01:36:16.74
It's still pretty fun.

1331
01:36:16.74 --> 01:36:20.42
But for most people, I would argue, most people exercise.

1332
01:36:20.42 --> 01:36:21.42
It's like work.

1333
01:36:21.42 --> 01:36:22.42
It's like a short.

1334
01:36:22.42 --> 01:36:23.42
Yeah.

1335
01:36:23.42 --> 01:36:26.34
And I think the more you do it and the better you get at it,

1336
01:36:26.34 --> 01:36:30.82
the more fun it is, the more you enjoy it.

1337
01:36:30.82 --> 01:36:32.90
For me, it's a mental break.

1338
01:36:32.90 --> 01:36:35.10
You know, it's a mental break from everything else.

1339
01:36:35.10 --> 01:36:36.26
I, you know what I'm gonna do?

1340
01:36:36.26 --> 01:36:39.74
I'm gonna go pick up this piece of metal off the ground.

1341
01:36:39.74 --> 01:36:40.74
A bunch of times.

1342
01:36:40.74 --> 01:36:41.74
Yeah.

1343
01:36:41.74 --> 01:36:45.74
And the point there is if you can get to that state where,

1344
01:36:45.74 --> 01:36:49.90
actually doing the exercise, separate from the results.

1345
01:36:49.90 --> 01:36:53.42
Actually doing it is fun.

1346
01:36:53.42 --> 01:36:56.90
You can recognize the pleasure in it.

1347
01:36:56.90 --> 01:37:00.66
That's when you can be on a program.

1348
01:37:00.66 --> 01:37:03.02
You know, Holly, I just got back from Kauai.

1349
01:37:03.02 --> 01:37:06.74
Little like a vacation, but I still, I still rolled.

1350
01:37:06.74 --> 01:37:10.62
I still did, you know, lift it away and exercise.

1351
01:37:10.62 --> 01:37:12.10
Great train with, went.

1352
01:37:12.10 --> 01:37:13.10
So.

1353
01:37:13.10 --> 01:37:14.10
Right.

1354
01:37:14.10 --> 01:37:17.22
Before and I think most people, it's when it's vacation time.

1355
01:37:17.22 --> 01:37:18.74
They're off the program.

1356
01:37:18.74 --> 01:37:21.30
And I'm not even saying I'm specifically on a program,

1357
01:37:21.30 --> 01:37:23.46
but it's just a part of the life program.

1358
01:37:23.46 --> 01:37:24.74
On the, yeah, on the deal, man.

1359
01:37:24.74 --> 01:37:27.78
So if you, if you're into it, you know, like,

1360
01:37:27.78 --> 01:37:30.58
I look forward to going training at a new spot.

1361
01:37:30.58 --> 01:37:31.70
There's a lot of fun to be had.

1362
01:37:31.70 --> 01:37:34.78
There's a lot of fun to be having going to treat the normal spot.

1363
01:37:36.10 --> 01:37:39.10
But if you're in that mindset where you like the exercise

1364
01:37:39.10 --> 01:37:40.22
that you're doing, right?

1365
01:37:40.22 --> 01:37:41.06
You'll do it.

1366
01:37:41.06 --> 01:37:41.90
You go on vacation.

1367
01:37:41.90 --> 01:37:44.06
You'll do it that fucking forward to it.

1368
01:37:44.06 --> 01:37:44.58
Yeah.

1369
01:37:44.58 --> 01:37:45.30
There's no doubt.

1370
01:37:45.30 --> 01:37:46.10
So you don't follow.

1371
01:37:46.10 --> 01:37:49.22
Having fun when you train is is.

1372
01:37:49.22 --> 01:37:50.22
End enjoying it.

1373
01:37:50.22 --> 01:37:54.22
I guess having fun because I did not like when I'm in the middle of a set of

1374
01:37:54.22 --> 01:37:55.22
clean and jerks.

1375
01:37:55.22 --> 01:37:57.02
I'm having fun.

1376
01:37:57.02 --> 01:38:01.10
See, but that's kind of what I mean though, where I remember when I

1377
01:38:01.10 --> 01:38:04.06
used to play football, we'd, we'd test in Olympic lifting.

1378
01:38:04.06 --> 01:38:07.26
So like, power clean was one and snatch was one.

1379
01:38:07.26 --> 01:38:09.38
And I remember training for those things.

1380
01:38:09.38 --> 01:38:11.50
If you get kind of good at the technique, right?

1381
01:38:11.50 --> 01:38:12.14
Comes fun.

1382
01:38:12.14 --> 01:38:12.34
Yeah.

1383
01:38:12.34 --> 01:38:13.14
There were your friends.

1384
01:38:13.14 --> 01:38:14.14
There's a lot of fun.

1385
01:38:14.14 --> 01:38:18.14
I guess I was thinking more of like a met constant.

1386
01:38:18.14 --> 01:38:19.14
Yeah.

1387
01:38:19.14 --> 01:38:20.14
What are you wanting to do?

1388
01:38:20.14 --> 01:38:21.14
Good.

1389
01:38:21.14 --> 01:38:22.14
Good.

1390
01:38:22.14 --> 01:38:23.14
Good.

1391
01:38:23.14 --> 01:38:24.74
And I've just been frank with you.

1392
01:38:24.74 --> 01:38:26.94
I'm not always having fun during those.

1393
01:38:26.94 --> 01:38:29.34
Sometimes I want to not do it.

1394
01:38:29.34 --> 01:38:30.34
Yeah.

1395
01:38:30.34 --> 01:38:31.34
And I still do it.

1396
01:38:31.34 --> 01:38:32.34
But I don't want to.

1397
01:38:32.34 --> 01:38:33.34
It's not fun.

1398
01:38:33.34 --> 01:38:35.34
I would say more times than not, especially in the met constitution.

1399
01:38:35.34 --> 01:38:36.34
That's going to be the case.

1400
01:38:36.34 --> 01:38:42.86
So my overall point is if you can get to that point where at the very least,

1401
01:38:42.86 --> 01:38:45.22
you can appreciate this that's happening right now.

1402
01:38:45.22 --> 01:38:48.10
I like, I find some.

1403
01:38:48.10 --> 01:38:49.10
Yes.

1404
01:38:49.10 --> 01:38:55.94
And furthermore, I will tell you this, if you get to know the feeling of how you feel

1405
01:38:55.94 --> 01:38:59.70
when you complete a hard workout, like you go, you know what?

1406
01:38:59.70 --> 01:39:03.10
It's going to be worth it because when I get done with this, I'm going to feel like

1407
01:39:03.10 --> 01:39:04.10
X.

1408
01:39:04.10 --> 01:39:05.10
Right.

1409
01:39:05.10 --> 01:39:06.10
I'm going to feel good.

1410
01:39:06.10 --> 01:39:09.98
And so that for me, that's why I'm, I think that's kind of why I'm doing hard

1411
01:39:09.98 --> 01:39:12.82
workouts because I'm doing hard workouts because I know that at the end of it,

1412
01:39:12.82 --> 01:39:14.86
I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm going to feel good.

1413
01:39:14.86 --> 01:39:17.58
I'm going to feel fired up for the rest of the day.

1414
01:39:17.58 --> 01:39:20.26
I'm going to feel like I did something.

1415
01:39:20.26 --> 01:39:25.86
I'm going to feel like a quality human being, like I didn't waste a little section

1416
01:39:25.86 --> 01:39:26.86
of my life.

1417
01:39:26.86 --> 01:39:27.86
I feel good.

1418
01:39:27.86 --> 01:39:28.86
Yeah.

1419
01:39:28.86 --> 01:39:32.34
So when you know what that, it's the same thing with waking up in the morning.

1420
01:39:32.34 --> 01:39:36.50
When you sleep in, that feels good at the moment.

1421
01:39:36.50 --> 01:39:42.42
But then when you wake up, you're like, oh man, I just wasted part of my life.

1422
01:39:42.42 --> 01:39:45.62
Whereas when you get up, even though it's hard, when you know how good it feels to be

1423
01:39:45.62 --> 01:39:50.06
done with your workout, that early in the morning, be like, yeah, I'm ready to bring

1424
01:39:50.06 --> 01:39:51.06
it, bring on the tasks.

1425
01:39:51.06 --> 01:39:52.06
Yeah.

1426
01:39:52.06 --> 01:40:02.02
And the strange thing about workouts is the workout pays you, pays you back for your work afterwards.

1427
01:40:02.02 --> 01:40:07.46
So it's basically, you know, you workout and the workout isn't what makes your muscle

1428
01:40:07.46 --> 01:40:08.46
big.

1429
01:40:08.46 --> 01:40:09.82
It's the response to the workout.

1430
01:40:09.82 --> 01:40:12.86
So when you workout, it's kind of like you did your part.

1431
01:40:12.86 --> 01:40:15.70
Now your body's going to pay you back with your gains, you know?

1432
01:40:15.70 --> 01:40:16.70
True.

1433
01:40:16.70 --> 01:40:17.86
So you're like, hey, I'm done with the workout.

1434
01:40:17.86 --> 01:40:19.38
I can go do some other stuff.

1435
01:40:19.38 --> 01:40:21.34
Meanwhile, I got that check coming.

1436
01:40:21.34 --> 01:40:22.58
That gains check.

1437
01:40:22.58 --> 01:40:24.06
That's a good daily.

1438
01:40:24.06 --> 01:40:25.06
Yeah.

1439
01:40:25.06 --> 01:40:26.06
That's a good daily.

1440
01:40:26.06 --> 01:40:27.06
Yeah.

1441
01:40:27.06 --> 01:40:28.06
That's awesome.

1442
01:40:28.06 --> 01:40:29.86
I'll see you there with me.

1443
01:40:29.86 --> 01:40:33.34
And now I think it's about time we go to the interwebs.

1444
01:40:33.34 --> 01:40:34.34
Sure.

1445
01:40:34.34 --> 01:40:39.50
But first, you can actually support the podcast through the

1446
01:40:39.50 --> 01:40:40.50
interwebs.

1447
01:40:40.50 --> 01:40:41.50
It's echo.

1448
01:40:41.50 --> 01:40:43.50
How do we do it?

1449
01:40:43.50 --> 01:40:46.10
Well, let the troopers know.

1450
01:40:46.10 --> 01:40:53.66
One of the ways, which may sound repetitive, but necessarily so in my opinion, on it.com

1451
01:40:53.66 --> 01:40:59.74
slash jockel, because some people they want to improve their improvement with supplements.

1452
01:40:59.74 --> 01:41:02.98
And we recommend, oh, we, I recommend supplements that work.

1453
01:41:02.98 --> 01:41:03.98
I'm assuming you do too.

1454
01:41:03.98 --> 01:41:04.98
I actually do.

1455
01:41:04.98 --> 01:41:05.98
Yeah.

1456
01:41:05.98 --> 01:41:06.98
There you go.

1457
01:41:06.98 --> 01:41:07.98
So you get them from on.

1458
01:41:07.98 --> 01:41:10.10
Improvement.

1459
01:41:10.10 --> 01:41:11.90
On it.com slash jockel.

1460
01:41:11.90 --> 01:41:14.18
Shroom tech.

1461
01:41:14.18 --> 01:41:15.90
These are ones I take.

1462
01:41:15.90 --> 01:41:17.38
Or have taken.

1463
01:41:17.38 --> 01:41:18.38
Shroom tech.

1464
01:41:18.38 --> 01:41:23.50
Alpha brain.

1465
01:41:23.50 --> 01:41:24.90
Crile oil for me.

1466
01:41:24.90 --> 01:41:25.90
Yeah.

1467
01:41:25.90 --> 01:41:26.90
We're out of their audit.

1468
01:41:26.90 --> 01:41:27.90
Out of Crile oil.

1469
01:41:27.90 --> 01:41:28.90
Right now.

1470
01:41:28.90 --> 01:41:29.90
Has a tail.

1471
01:41:29.90 --> 01:41:30.90
They won't be.

1472
01:41:30.90 --> 01:41:31.90
Yeah.

1473
01:41:31.90 --> 01:41:32.90
They'll be finding a Crile oil.

1474
01:41:32.90 --> 01:41:35.66
So just keep keeping your finger on the pulse of the Crile oil situation.

1475
01:41:35.66 --> 01:41:39.82
And then the, or your bar boom, that's good.

1476
01:41:39.82 --> 01:41:41.62
That's not, is that a supplement, do you think?

1477
01:41:41.62 --> 01:41:42.62
Would you call this a fruit?

1478
01:41:42.62 --> 01:41:43.62
That's just tasty.

1479
01:41:43.62 --> 01:41:44.62
That's just tasty.

1480
01:41:44.62 --> 01:41:45.62
Yeah.

1481
01:41:45.62 --> 01:41:46.62
On it.

1482
01:41:46.62 --> 01:41:47.62
.com slash jockel.

1483
01:41:47.62 --> 01:41:49.62
Get 10% off all supplements.

1484
01:41:49.62 --> 01:41:51.82
Let's do it.

1485
01:41:51.82 --> 01:41:58.82
Also if you like the shirts that we make, go to jockelstore.com and get one or more of that of

1486
01:41:58.82 --> 01:41:59.82
those.

1487
01:41:59.82 --> 01:42:00.82
Oh, man.

1488
01:42:00.82 --> 01:42:01.82
Yeah.

1489
01:42:01.82 --> 01:42:04.26
That's a good way to support, I think.

1490
01:42:04.26 --> 01:42:12.42
And before you do your Amazon shop shopping, click through jockelpodcast.com.

1491
01:42:12.42 --> 01:42:15.98
There's like, there's a little link on there.

1492
01:42:15.98 --> 01:42:16.98
And then jockelstore.

1493
01:42:16.98 --> 01:42:18.54
So while this is Amazon link, click their first.

1494
01:42:18.54 --> 01:42:20.42
Then do the shopping.

1495
01:42:20.42 --> 01:42:25.10
Also on the jockelpodcast website, we have all, I put all the books that you cover on

1496
01:42:25.10 --> 01:42:26.10
all these podcasts.

1497
01:42:26.10 --> 01:42:27.46
So you can see what they're about.

1498
01:42:27.46 --> 01:42:28.46
Click on it.

1499
01:42:28.46 --> 01:42:31.54
If you want to get one of those books, boom.

1500
01:42:31.54 --> 01:42:36.54
And then audible.com.

1501
01:42:36.54 --> 01:42:39.26
Automol is just the way to listen to audiobook.

1502
01:42:39.26 --> 01:42:44.58
So what they're doing is they're giving you 30 days free, 30.

1503
01:42:44.58 --> 01:42:46.38
If you got audible.com slash jockel.

1504
01:42:46.38 --> 01:42:52.66
So you get 30 days free and then you get to download a free book.

1505
01:42:52.66 --> 01:42:54.06
What one should they download?

1506
01:42:54.06 --> 01:42:55.06
Deep thing.

1507
01:42:55.06 --> 01:42:56.06
Would you recommend?

1508
01:42:56.06 --> 01:42:59.38
I think my recommendation would clearly be a little book by jockelwillink and

1509
01:42:59.38 --> 01:43:02.50
a live bab in called Extreme Ownership.

1510
01:43:02.50 --> 01:43:04.22
We actually read the audiobook too.

1511
01:43:04.22 --> 01:43:07.82
So if you like the jockelpodcast, you're probably going to like here in the extreme

1512
01:43:07.82 --> 01:43:09.06
ownership read by us.

1513
01:43:09.06 --> 01:43:10.58
It's about eight hours long.

1514
01:43:10.58 --> 01:43:15.30
So it's like getting four podcasts, maybe even five podcasts.

1515
01:43:15.30 --> 01:43:22.14
But yeah, we've gotten some really, because of the support people have shown the podcasts

1516
01:43:22.14 --> 01:43:23.54
and it's become a more popular.

1517
01:43:23.54 --> 01:43:26.90
We've been getting hammered by a bunch of people that want to sponsor us.

1518
01:43:26.90 --> 01:43:29.30
And we don't want a bunch of sponsors.

1519
01:43:29.30 --> 01:43:31.34
In fact, we don't want any.

1520
01:43:31.34 --> 01:43:35.74
The only thing we want is if there's things that can help people.

1521
01:43:35.74 --> 01:43:37.74
Help people get better.

1522
01:43:37.74 --> 01:43:38.98
Well, then that's what we want.

1523
01:43:38.98 --> 01:43:44.86
So on it gives you the supplements that you need, some of the gear that you need.

1524
01:43:44.86 --> 01:43:49.82
And then on top of that, you got audible, which is a way to listen to books while you can't

1525
01:43:49.82 --> 01:43:51.50
have the ability to read.

1526
01:43:51.50 --> 01:43:56.74
So if you're driving, if you're doing yard work, if you're doing something that requires

1527
01:43:56.74 --> 01:44:02.86
your hands and your eyes, you can just listen to a book on audible.com slash jacco.

1528
01:44:02.86 --> 01:44:08.14
And so that's another way to also then thereby support the podcast.

1529
01:44:08.14 --> 01:44:10.02
30 days free book.

1530
01:44:10.02 --> 01:44:11.26
Do it.

1531
01:44:11.26 --> 01:44:12.26
Get smarter.

1532
01:44:12.26 --> 01:44:16.66
I recommend the extreme ownership as well.

1533
01:44:16.66 --> 01:44:19.98
It's interesting that you guys read it, because that's not always the case right?

1534
01:44:19.98 --> 01:44:22.66
Sometimes it's like a professional reader or whatever.

1535
01:44:22.66 --> 01:44:26.90
But like if you know what life's voice sounds like, sounds like Batman.

1536
01:44:26.90 --> 01:44:27.90
Yeah.

1537
01:44:27.90 --> 01:44:28.90
That's all.

1538
01:44:28.90 --> 01:44:29.90
Batman.

1539
01:44:29.90 --> 01:44:30.90
Anyway, there it is.

1540
01:44:30.90 --> 01:44:31.90
Yes indeed.

1541
01:44:31.90 --> 01:44:33.90
So yeah, there you go.

1542
01:44:33.90 --> 01:44:34.90
Let's get to the question.

1543
01:44:34.90 --> 01:44:35.90
Now let's get to the questions.

1544
01:44:35.90 --> 01:44:36.90
Now let's get to the questions.

1545
01:44:36.90 --> 01:44:37.90
I'm down.

1546
01:44:37.90 --> 01:44:39.90
All right.

1547
01:44:39.90 --> 01:44:41.90
First question.

1548
01:44:41.90 --> 01:44:47.22
Jacco, do you ever feel burnt out from going full tilt several days or several weeks in

1549
01:44:47.22 --> 01:44:48.22
a row?

1550
01:44:48.22 --> 01:44:50.18
And if so, what do you do?

1551
01:44:50.18 --> 01:44:51.18
Never.

1552
01:44:51.18 --> 01:44:57.18
No, of course, you know, burn in the candle above ends.

1553
01:44:57.18 --> 01:45:00.02
Eventually it's going to catch up with you.

1554
01:45:00.02 --> 01:45:07.18
And for me, it's can come in the form of too much travel, too much exercise.

1555
01:45:07.18 --> 01:45:11.86
Sometimes I'll just be pressed at work, working with a bunch of different companies.

1556
01:45:11.86 --> 01:45:15.14
Sometimes I'm writing and I'm trying to get a bunch of writing done.

1557
01:45:15.14 --> 01:45:18.06
Sometimes I'm training so much due to it's going crazy.

1558
01:45:18.06 --> 01:45:22.02
So anyways, or a lot of times it's the combination of all these things going on at once,

1559
01:45:22.02 --> 01:45:25.02
because I'm trying to get a bunch done in a short amount of time.

1560
01:45:25.02 --> 01:45:30.54
And I end up whatever coming off the track, a little bit, coming off the rails a little

1561
01:45:30.54 --> 01:45:31.54
bit.

1562
01:45:31.54 --> 01:45:34.66
And so what do I do on those kind of days when I'm starting to feel like that?

1563
01:45:34.66 --> 01:45:39.82
Well, number one, I like to force myself to do it anyways.

1564
01:45:39.82 --> 01:45:41.34
That is a reality.

1565
01:45:41.34 --> 01:45:46.38
So if even if I'm, if I don't feel like working out, I'll be like, you know, I'll

1566
01:45:46.38 --> 01:45:50.62
go, I'll go and work out an easier work out, or I don't want to train GJT.

1567
01:45:50.62 --> 01:45:52.14
We were talking about this earlier.

1568
01:45:52.14 --> 01:45:53.38
Don't really feel like training.

1569
01:45:53.38 --> 01:45:57.02
I'm going to go train anyways.

1570
01:45:57.02 --> 01:46:00.46
Then maybe there's some form of work that I'm still still.

1571
01:46:00.46 --> 01:46:01.98
I'm just going to go and do the work anyways.

1572
01:46:01.98 --> 01:46:09.82
Now, if the next day, I still feel like I need a break.

1573
01:46:09.82 --> 01:46:12.74
That's sort of my red flag to say, all right, you know what, you need a break.

1574
01:46:12.74 --> 01:46:21.14
You need to take some time, relax, do some kind of active rest.

1575
01:46:21.14 --> 01:46:24.06
I don't really like just kind of sitting around.

1576
01:46:24.06 --> 01:46:32.34
I'll do something kind of active and probably eat some stakes, plural.

1577
01:46:32.34 --> 01:46:33.58
Trying to eat something really good.

1578
01:46:33.58 --> 01:46:41.22
Trying to eat just, you know, I might eat something really good like stakes.

1579
01:46:41.22 --> 01:46:47.38
Maybe sleep, take an extra nap, try and feel better, do some kind of stretching to try

1580
01:46:47.38 --> 01:46:48.38
and feel better.

1581
01:46:48.38 --> 01:46:49.66
Just recover.

1582
01:46:49.66 --> 01:46:50.66
Just recover.

1583
01:46:50.66 --> 01:46:52.18
So yes, I'm not super human.

1584
01:46:52.18 --> 01:46:57.86
Like anybody else, sometimes I get broken down, beat up, and I need some downtime.

1585
01:46:57.86 --> 01:46:58.86
And that's what I do.

1586
01:46:58.86 --> 01:47:01.46
I try and rest, relax, and eat some good food.

1587
01:47:01.46 --> 01:47:05.50
Yeah, that's a good one that I started to incorporate how you were saying, if I don't feel

1588
01:47:05.50 --> 01:47:10.42
like it or if I feel like I'm starting to get burnt out, you'll, it's like that one

1589
01:47:10.42 --> 01:47:11.42
last thing.

1590
01:47:11.42 --> 01:47:13.94
Let me just do it anyway.

1591
01:47:13.94 --> 01:47:18.86
And then I'll see if I do it, you know, because sometimes I like how you say you avoid the situation

1592
01:47:18.86 --> 01:47:20.50
where you just not in the mood.

1593
01:47:20.50 --> 01:47:22.86
If you're at some days, you're just not in the mood, but it doesn't mean you're burnt

1594
01:47:22.86 --> 01:47:23.86
out.

1595
01:47:23.86 --> 01:47:25.86
You're just not in the mood for whatever reason.

1596
01:47:25.86 --> 01:47:29.26
So that's a good way to kind of weed those days out.

1597
01:47:29.26 --> 01:47:33.46
And yeah, if you're still burnt out the next day or even the next day after that, then

1598
01:47:33.46 --> 01:47:34.94
I said, okay, you gotta rest.

1599
01:47:34.94 --> 01:47:39.98
I started doing that and you'd be surprised what it, how many times you really not burnt

1600
01:47:39.98 --> 01:47:41.98
out, you just not in the mood.

1601
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:45.66
That's a B.

1602
01:47:45.66 --> 01:47:51.78
You might not agree with this, but if you are like, not, what it'd be burnt out or just tired

1603
01:47:51.78 --> 01:47:55.30
of you, you know, you're, you just, you just tired of the grind or whatever and you need

1604
01:47:55.30 --> 01:47:58.26
a break of vacation or whatever.

1605
01:47:58.26 --> 01:48:00.54
What I saw.

1606
01:48:00.54 --> 01:48:08.98
What I sometimes do is don't do like filming for example where there would be times where

1607
01:48:08.98 --> 01:48:14.42
I would spend months just filming every week, filming in a film, and like, no brick.

1608
01:48:14.42 --> 01:48:21.46
And what I do is don't do any of it and don't think about it, don't do it at all.

1609
01:48:21.46 --> 01:48:26.42
And then slowly and you, in my experience, I was surprised how quick it came back where you

1610
01:48:26.42 --> 01:48:28.34
kind of want to get back to it.

1611
01:48:28.34 --> 01:48:32.50
But then I go like a week, still not doing it.

1612
01:48:32.50 --> 01:48:35.42
It's like, you're just, if you're like, I'm tired of training every day or whatever, you

1613
01:48:35.42 --> 01:48:36.78
had to turn them in and whatever.

1614
01:48:36.78 --> 01:48:38.78
And you're like, bad, I got to take a break.

1615
01:48:38.78 --> 01:48:42.86
Sure, but probably like three days if you're a competitor, three days, you're like, man,

1616
01:48:42.86 --> 01:48:44.38
I want to get back on the mats.

1617
01:48:44.38 --> 01:48:47.14
So what you do is you push that even more.

1618
01:48:47.14 --> 01:48:52.10
So it's like you're, you're pushing yourself to be burnt out on the recovery.

1619
01:48:52.10 --> 01:48:57.58
So the only, the only medicine for that burnt out of recovery is to get back into it.

1620
01:48:57.58 --> 01:49:01.38
But that hunger of getting back into it is even more than it normally would be after

1621
01:49:01.38 --> 01:49:02.38
normal break.

1622
01:49:02.38 --> 01:49:03.74
That makes sense.

1623
01:49:03.74 --> 01:49:08.74
I guess, and I just want to call us and both out right now for being total.

1624
01:49:08.74 --> 01:49:09.74
Cream puffs.

1625
01:49:09.74 --> 01:49:10.90
I think it's what Bob often said.

1626
01:49:10.90 --> 01:49:16.74
Here we are talking about how we get burnt out on working out training filming.

1627
01:49:16.74 --> 01:49:23.42
It's like Bob, Bob Hoffman was, you know, living in the seeds of mustard gas floating

1628
01:49:23.42 --> 01:49:24.42
around.

1629
01:49:24.42 --> 01:49:25.42
Yeah.

1630
01:49:25.42 --> 01:49:28.58
And maybe we should just say, don't get burnt out.

1631
01:49:28.58 --> 01:49:29.58
Just work harder.

1632
01:49:29.58 --> 01:49:30.58
Yeah.

1633
01:49:30.58 --> 01:49:31.58
Sorry.

1634
01:49:31.58 --> 01:49:34.06
You may be so real bad they're filming.

1635
01:49:34.06 --> 01:49:38.22
No, I mean, like, like, like, I was like, oh, I was typing on a computer.

1636
01:49:38.22 --> 01:49:39.22
And we'll burnt out.

1637
01:49:39.22 --> 01:49:40.22
Shut up, Jocco.

1638
01:49:40.22 --> 01:49:41.22
Yeah.

1639
01:49:41.22 --> 01:49:42.22
I got a better idea.

1640
01:49:42.22 --> 01:49:46.38
Why don't you just be fired up that you have the opportunity to create something?

1641
01:49:46.38 --> 01:49:47.38
How's that sound?

1642
01:49:47.38 --> 01:49:51.98
Oh, you got the opportunity to go train your jitsu to go get better physically.

1643
01:49:51.98 --> 01:49:53.82
Oh, I think I'm going to go ahead and do that.

1644
01:49:53.82 --> 01:49:56.86
I'm not going to sit there and say, I'm burnt out on training.

1645
01:49:56.86 --> 01:49:57.86
No.

1646
01:49:57.86 --> 01:49:59.50
No, don't be burnt out.

1647
01:49:59.50 --> 01:50:04.54
If Bob Hoffman's not burnt out on the front lines of World War I, I don't think we

1648
01:50:04.54 --> 01:50:08.78
haven't used to be burnt out on the pleasurable things we get to do in life.

1649
01:50:08.78 --> 01:50:12.26
Let's suck it up and just drive on of changing my answer.

1650
01:50:12.26 --> 01:50:13.26
How's that?

1651
01:50:13.26 --> 01:50:14.26
All right.

1652
01:50:14.26 --> 01:50:17.26
There you go.

1653
01:50:17.26 --> 01:50:18.26
Next question.

1654
01:50:18.26 --> 01:50:19.26
Jocco.

1655
01:50:19.26 --> 01:50:21.62
Hi, guys.

1656
01:50:21.62 --> 01:50:23.42
How about Judo as a martial art?

1657
01:50:23.42 --> 01:50:27.66
Compared to Jitsu.

1658
01:50:27.66 --> 01:50:29.78
Judo is a great martial art.

1659
01:50:29.78 --> 01:50:33.34
And Jitsu is actually rooted in Judo.

1660
01:50:33.34 --> 01:50:37.62
And I guess originally Judo was rooted in Jiu Jitsu.

1661
01:50:37.62 --> 01:50:38.90
And there are some connections.

1662
01:50:38.90 --> 01:50:46.90
I mean, Maida from Japan, he taught Judo to Carlos Gracie in Brazil, which was then learned

1663
01:50:46.90 --> 01:50:53.74
by Ali Ograci, who then morphed it into what we consider now to be Brazilian or Gracie Jiu

1664
01:50:53.74 --> 01:50:56.22
Jitsu.

1665
01:50:56.22 --> 01:51:02.30
But you can see clearly if you look at Judo that Jiu Jitsu exists inside.

1666
01:51:02.30 --> 01:51:05.98
I mean, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu exists inside of Judo.

1667
01:51:05.98 --> 01:51:07.34
There's no doubt about it.

1668
01:51:07.34 --> 01:51:12.74
But there are some things about Judo that have morphed it into a different direction.

1669
01:51:12.74 --> 01:51:18.10
Number one, in Judo if you throw somebody and anything touched the ground before their feet

1670
01:51:18.10 --> 01:51:19.10
you went on a matter of fact.

1671
01:51:19.10 --> 01:51:21.66
You can also pin people in Judo.

1672
01:51:21.66 --> 01:51:26.54
If you hold them down for I think it's 20 seconds, then the match is over and you win both

1673
01:51:26.54 --> 01:51:27.54
of those.

1674
01:51:27.54 --> 01:51:31.90
So what that does is now you can imagine if you get thrown, okay, you win.

1675
01:51:31.90 --> 01:51:35.50
If you're on the ground with your back down for 20 seconds you win.

1676
01:51:35.50 --> 01:51:36.50
So what does that do?

1677
01:51:36.50 --> 01:51:41.34
It eliminates a part of fighting that is very important.

1678
01:51:41.34 --> 01:51:47.30
And there are really two pieces of Judo.

1679
01:51:47.30 --> 01:51:51.66
One of them is called Randory, which is basically rolling and the other one is Nahuaza,

1680
01:51:51.66 --> 01:51:53.34
which is groundwork.

1681
01:51:53.34 --> 01:52:00.30
And those two are directly correlated to our part of Jiu Jitsu.

1682
01:52:00.30 --> 01:52:04.38
But Jiu Jitsu bottom line, in both these, if you don't know anything about these two,

1683
01:52:04.38 --> 01:52:06.90
Jiu Jitsu allows the fight to go on.

1684
01:52:06.90 --> 01:52:11.26
Even after you get thrown and it allows the fight, you can't, there's no pinning in

1685
01:52:11.26 --> 01:52:12.26
Jiu Jitsu.

1686
01:52:12.26 --> 01:52:16.62
You are allowed to fight and continue to fight until the match is over.

1687
01:52:16.62 --> 01:52:22.62
And you can recover from being pinned, just like you can recover from being thrown.

1688
01:52:22.62 --> 01:52:23.62
And it doesn't really matter.

1689
01:52:23.62 --> 01:52:26.26
I mean, today we were training today and we got some good Judo players.

1690
01:52:26.26 --> 01:52:33.86
Killing was, you know, Judo Killing, and he tossed, he tossed Andy, big Andy.

1691
01:52:33.86 --> 01:52:37.94
And I mean, because he's better at Judo, and he tossed him and it was legit,

1692
01:52:37.94 --> 01:52:42.42
then Andy ended up getting out of that position and getting in a better position.

1693
01:52:42.42 --> 01:52:45.70
And so the fight wasn't over just because he got thrown.

1694
01:52:45.70 --> 01:52:53.10
And so that's one of the big benefits of Jiu Jitsu is that you will generally learn

1695
01:52:53.10 --> 01:52:56.54
to better ground game.

1696
01:52:56.54 --> 01:52:58.82
But Judo, you will definitely have better take down.

1697
01:52:58.82 --> 01:53:02.54
So I mean, a Judo player is going to have better take down so that a Jiu Jitsu player.

1698
01:53:02.54 --> 01:53:05.94
And I'll tell you, if we're just going to start ranking things, you got to throw wrestling

1699
01:53:05.94 --> 01:53:10.50
out there because wrestling has possibly better take down the Judo.

1700
01:53:10.50 --> 01:53:14.74
I mean, with the Giveshure, Judo has an advantage.

1701
01:53:14.74 --> 01:53:20.06
But if you don't know this, in 2010, they actually banned the double leg take down from

1702
01:53:20.06 --> 01:53:22.66
Judo competitions in the whole world.

1703
01:53:22.66 --> 01:53:23.66
Why?

1704
01:53:23.66 --> 01:53:25.86
Because wrestlers came in and started double leg in people.

1705
01:53:25.86 --> 01:53:28.58
But boom, just hitting double legs.

1706
01:53:28.58 --> 01:53:34.22
So yes, I would say Judo is an awesome martial art.

1707
01:53:34.22 --> 01:53:40.42
It really in some ways could be considered the precursor to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

1708
01:53:40.42 --> 01:53:47.74
Even though Judo itself comes from actual Japanese Jiu Jitsu.

1709
01:53:47.74 --> 01:53:51.02
But I would say if you're going to, if you got the opportunity to learn Judo, yeah, learn

1710
01:53:51.02 --> 01:53:52.02
it.

1711
01:53:52.02 --> 01:53:55.78
Hopefully, you'll learn the take down and those are great things to have in real life,

1712
01:53:55.78 --> 01:53:59.74
they're great things to have in self-defense situations to be able to take someone down

1713
01:53:59.74 --> 01:54:02.66
with Judo throws a lot of awesome in Jiu Jitsu competitions.

1714
01:54:02.66 --> 01:54:06.58
If you're a Judo player in Jiu Jitsu competitions, you're going to get the take down with

1715
01:54:06.58 --> 01:54:10.78
the win-it-to-gui competition, unless you're going against a really good wrestler.

1716
01:54:10.78 --> 01:54:13.78
So good thing to augment Jiu Jitsu with.

1717
01:54:13.78 --> 01:54:17.38
But I would say you would want to make Jiu Jitsu your main focus.

1718
01:54:17.38 --> 01:54:22.70
I agree.

1719
01:54:22.70 --> 01:54:26.58
So a lot of times when you learn Jiu Jitsu, a lot of guys especially nowadays, a lot of guys

1720
01:54:26.58 --> 01:54:29.14
avoid the take down elements.

1721
01:54:29.14 --> 01:54:33.34
So they know ground game is just vast, but the take down elements, so you'll get a lot

1722
01:54:33.34 --> 01:54:34.34
of people pulling guard.

1723
01:54:34.34 --> 01:54:36.62
Which just means pulling a guy down on top of you.

1724
01:54:36.62 --> 01:54:39.94
Which is a crazy thing to do in a real fight.

1725
01:54:39.94 --> 01:54:45.70
Yeah, but man, if you're good for sure, that's what's crazy about it.

1726
01:54:45.70 --> 01:54:49.38
No, even if you're really good at it, you don't want to be pulling feet.

1727
01:54:49.38 --> 01:54:50.78
No one's top of you in a street fight.

1728
01:54:50.78 --> 01:54:51.78
I did.

1729
01:54:51.78 --> 01:54:52.78
Compared to being able to take them down.

1730
01:54:52.78 --> 01:54:53.78
Compared to being a little sign of your work.

1731
01:54:53.78 --> 01:54:54.78
Yeah, no brainer, yeah.

1732
01:54:54.78 --> 01:54:55.78
Not even close.

1733
01:54:55.78 --> 01:55:03.22
So what I like about wrestling, I think is more arguably more dynamic of the thing because

1734
01:55:03.22 --> 01:55:08.30
it's all these different situations, even on top of just the take down part.

1735
01:55:08.30 --> 01:55:12.10
But man, Judo, I feel like it takes a little less energy.

1736
01:55:12.10 --> 01:55:17.34
And it can kind of keep you in positionally, it can keep you in safe areas when you're

1737
01:55:17.34 --> 01:55:21.78
standing up because you know like these weird positions where you're on balance and that

1738
01:55:21.78 --> 01:55:26.42
guy's off balance or you you're controlling the guy's weight when you're standing up.

1739
01:55:26.42 --> 01:55:31.06
And so I learned like a signal, I took Judo when I was young for a little bit.

1740
01:55:31.06 --> 01:55:34.86
That's where I never would have guessed that for a little bit.

1741
01:55:34.86 --> 01:55:35.86
Yeah.

1742
01:55:35.86 --> 01:55:36.86
That's really little bit.

1743
01:55:36.86 --> 01:55:37.86
Anyway.

1744
01:55:37.86 --> 01:55:44.62
And then, but as an adult I learned a little bit of Judo from Terry, so could you.

1745
01:55:44.62 --> 01:55:46.82
See how's the Judo background?

1746
01:55:46.82 --> 01:55:48.10
And man, he was showing me stuff.

1747
01:55:48.10 --> 01:55:50.10
He was like, hey, wrestlers will do this.

1748
01:55:50.10 --> 01:55:54.34
And he kind of show how they grab your head and neck and he's like, and here's what you

1749
01:55:54.34 --> 01:55:55.62
do as a Judo guy.

1750
01:55:55.62 --> 01:55:57.86
And he, it's an elaborate thing you taught me.

1751
01:55:57.86 --> 01:55:59.18
But it's like, dang.

1752
01:55:59.18 --> 01:56:05.50
These are real useful things for Judo even aside from the take down part of it.

1753
01:56:05.50 --> 01:56:09.26
And then going to the take down part of it, if you know the take down solid, even if you

1754
01:56:09.26 --> 01:56:12.86
know like three or four really good ones and you're really good at them, that'll change

1755
01:56:12.86 --> 01:56:16.26
your whole approach and your whole outlook on Judo.

1756
01:56:16.26 --> 01:56:17.98
So, okay, and here's an example.

1757
01:56:17.98 --> 01:56:22.82
Let's say you go into, I don't know, you know, party or everyday thing where you could find

1758
01:56:22.82 --> 01:56:26.90
yourself in a situation where you got to get in a fight or defend yourself or your friend

1759
01:56:26.90 --> 01:56:28.30
or whatever.

1760
01:56:28.30 --> 01:56:33.62
If you know, take downs, especially take downs where you don't have to like risk.

1761
01:56:33.62 --> 01:56:38.34
And doing a double leg in a real situation, it's kind of an all or nothing situation.

1762
01:56:38.34 --> 01:56:43.02
You know, you can't just, it's not like this gradual escalating of force with a double

1763
01:56:43.02 --> 01:56:44.02
leg take down.

1764
01:56:44.02 --> 01:56:45.02
That's your answer.

1765
01:56:45.02 --> 01:56:46.02
Nice to meet you.

1766
01:56:46.02 --> 01:56:48.86
So, with Judo, it's to give me much more subtle with your take down.

1767
01:56:48.86 --> 01:56:52.74
With varying levels of force, you know, with the, with the Judo situation.

1768
01:56:52.74 --> 01:56:57.74
So if, and if you're good at that, men, when you get into these situations, it's like,

1769
01:56:57.74 --> 01:56:58.74
no factor.

1770
01:56:58.74 --> 01:57:00.18
You know, worried about it at all.

1771
01:57:00.18 --> 01:57:03.62
And they're like, you don't know take downs, but your Judo's sick.

1772
01:57:03.62 --> 01:57:06.22
You're like, not, not going to get this thing to the ground.

1773
01:57:06.22 --> 01:57:07.94
And it's like, that's going to be a pain in the ass.

1774
01:57:07.94 --> 01:57:09.14
Once we get there, I'm fine.

1775
01:57:09.14 --> 01:57:14.90
But just that one little crossover from standing or no fight to fight is like, yeah, it

1776
01:57:14.90 --> 01:57:16.70
kind of can provide some anxiety for you.

1777
01:57:16.70 --> 01:57:18.82
But if you know that, Judo, whatever.

1778
01:57:18.82 --> 01:57:19.82
Yep.

1779
01:57:19.82 --> 01:57:22.10
I guess the overall point is learn that Judo.

1780
01:57:22.10 --> 01:57:23.10
Very useful.

1781
01:57:23.10 --> 01:57:24.10
That's right.

1782
01:57:24.10 --> 01:57:27.42
And that's not to mention when the other guy knows it, you know what to do, too.

1783
01:57:27.42 --> 01:57:28.42
Yeah.

1784
01:57:28.42 --> 01:57:30.78
Otherwise, you're just getting taught.

1785
01:57:30.78 --> 01:57:31.78
Keeling toss media.

1786
01:57:31.78 --> 01:57:32.78
They're pretty funny.

1787
01:57:32.78 --> 01:57:37.52
Yeah, it's, and sometimes it can be funny and fun, because, you know, they can

1788
01:57:37.52 --> 01:57:39.34
toss you and you land in your back and stuff with them.

1789
01:57:39.34 --> 01:57:41.06
But men, you land on your head or something.

1790
01:57:41.06 --> 01:57:42.06
Yeah, that's true.

1791
01:57:42.06 --> 01:57:46.46
There is, there is some validity to the, upon in that, if you were in a street fight

1792
01:57:46.46 --> 01:57:50.06
and you've got thrown and land in the person puts you down in a bad way.

1793
01:57:50.06 --> 01:57:54.78
I mean, you're still, it's like, it's not like you're going to get knocked out 100% of the time,

1794
01:57:54.78 --> 01:57:56.50
probably not even 50% of the time.

1795
01:57:56.50 --> 01:58:00.52
But there is a, there is a chance that getting thrown, it's a palm style and a street

1796
01:58:00.52 --> 01:58:05.14
fight could be, I mean, you go, go pull up some judo videos of people getting tossed

1797
01:58:05.14 --> 01:58:08.62
it's a bone style even in the, in the high levels.

1798
01:58:08.62 --> 01:58:11.62
Some of those guys, if they landed on the street, they would be injured.

1799
01:58:11.62 --> 01:58:12.62
Not all the time.

1800
01:58:12.62 --> 01:58:15.22
And you do learn to, you learn to fall in judo.

1801
01:58:15.22 --> 01:58:17.42
You learn how to break your fall.

1802
01:58:17.42 --> 01:58:21.14
But yeah, some of those would be devastating if they happened to you in the street.

1803
01:58:21.14 --> 01:58:23.98
So that's why it's, it's a bone does have some validity to it.

1804
01:58:23.98 --> 01:58:29.10
But if you toss someone super hard and they landed on their back or on their head on the

1805
01:58:29.10 --> 01:58:32.22
street on concrete, they would be severe.

1806
01:58:32.22 --> 01:58:34.14
They would be, it could be a fight.

1807
01:58:34.14 --> 01:58:35.14
Ender.

1808
01:58:35.14 --> 01:58:36.74
But it's not going to be a fight.

1809
01:58:36.74 --> 01:58:37.74
Yeah.

1810
01:58:37.74 --> 01:58:38.74
That's the problem.

1811
01:58:38.74 --> 01:58:39.74
It's not going to be a fight.

1812
01:58:39.74 --> 01:58:41.50
It's possible that it's a fight.

1813
01:58:41.50 --> 01:58:45.82
Just like a left hook is possibly a fight.

1814
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:47.82
But it's not guaranteed to end a fight.

1815
01:58:47.82 --> 01:58:49.74
I'll tell you a guaranteed fight, ender.

1816
01:58:49.74 --> 01:58:50.74
We're in a good joke.

1817
01:58:50.74 --> 01:58:51.74
We're in a good joke.

1818
01:58:51.74 --> 01:58:52.74
We're in a good joke.

1819
01:58:52.74 --> 01:58:57.78
And if I'll tell you and knowing some judo and especially knowing some judo moves that

1820
01:58:57.78 --> 01:59:01.18
I feel like I'm pretty solid at, if you do it against the guy who doesn't really know

1821
01:59:01.18 --> 01:59:05.98
that much judo, it's your choice whether you want to put him on his head or his back.

1822
01:59:05.98 --> 01:59:06.98
It's your choice.

1823
01:59:06.98 --> 01:59:09.70
So if that's the other guys' choice that you're fighting with or competing against

1824
01:59:09.70 --> 01:59:12.82
or whatever, then that's his choice, that's yours.

1825
01:59:12.82 --> 01:59:15.50
So that's the reason to at least know.

1826
01:59:15.50 --> 01:59:17.26
Yeah, for sure you should know.

1827
01:59:17.26 --> 01:59:18.26
For sure.

1828
01:59:18.26 --> 01:59:20.26
I, yes, learn judo.

1829
01:59:20.26 --> 01:59:23.86
Learn wrestling.

1830
01:59:23.86 --> 01:59:24.86
Learn juditsu.

1831
01:59:24.86 --> 01:59:26.46
Juditsu is the most complicated.

1832
01:59:26.46 --> 01:59:27.46
Learn it first.

1833
01:59:27.46 --> 01:59:29.14
Spend the most time on it.

1834
01:59:29.14 --> 01:59:30.14
Learn to strike too.

1835
01:59:30.14 --> 01:59:31.14
Moitai, boxing.

1836
01:59:31.14 --> 01:59:33.54
Saying this for the millions of times.

1837
01:59:33.54 --> 01:59:35.90
I said one third again.

1838
01:59:35.90 --> 01:59:43.78
Although I actually do sometimes leave judo out, not intentionally, but just I just do.

1839
01:59:43.78 --> 01:59:45.34
I personally like judo.

1840
01:59:45.34 --> 01:59:46.34
No judo's wrestling.

1841
01:59:46.34 --> 01:59:47.34
I like it personally.

1842
01:59:47.34 --> 01:59:49.34
I like it better than wrestling.

1843
01:59:49.34 --> 01:59:55.02
Because when I was started to learn wrestling with them, I'm going to say great, Greg

1844
01:59:55.02 --> 01:59:56.02
train on you.

1845
01:59:56.02 --> 01:59:57.30
You didn't come and get you.

1846
01:59:57.30 --> 01:59:58.74
What I tell him this too.

1847
01:59:58.74 --> 02:00:00.54
But I'm not saying I dislike wrestling.

1848
02:00:00.54 --> 02:00:05.62
I'm just saying I like judo better because when you shoot a double or a single or something

1849
02:00:05.62 --> 02:00:08.30
and he stuffs it, you're in a bad situation.

1850
02:00:08.30 --> 02:00:09.30
You're in a bad situation.

1851
02:00:09.30 --> 02:00:14.30
Then if you go for, you know, some, you know, saying Nagi or something and you don't

1852
02:00:14.30 --> 02:00:15.58
get well, he's on your back.

1853
02:00:15.58 --> 02:00:18.38
But you know what I mean, though, is it failed judo throw?

1854
02:00:18.38 --> 02:00:21.38
You have way less of a price to pay typically.

1855
02:00:21.38 --> 02:00:26.86
Do you usually have less of a price to pay on a judo throw than you do in a wrestling

1856
02:00:26.86 --> 02:00:28.46
take down on your show?

1857
02:00:28.46 --> 02:00:29.46
Yeah.

1858
02:00:29.46 --> 02:00:30.46
And the whole thing depends on you.

1859
02:00:30.46 --> 02:00:36.14
Generally speaking, in my experience, that's why I'll give that to you with like a

1860
02:00:36.14 --> 02:00:38.90
small percentage of agreement, not a full.

1861
02:00:38.90 --> 02:00:41.14
Yeah, I mean, it's not that black and white for sure.

1862
02:00:41.14 --> 02:00:43.94
Because you look at Grego guys, Grego Roman Rust, exactly.

1863
02:00:43.94 --> 02:00:44.94
You have another not a group.

1864
02:00:44.94 --> 02:00:46.82
You know, I've not shooting on you anymore.

1865
02:00:46.82 --> 02:00:49.42
And believe me, you're getting tossed.

1866
02:00:49.42 --> 02:00:50.94
You train with a good Greco guy.

1867
02:00:50.94 --> 02:00:52.14
They're not grabbing your legs at all.

1868
02:00:52.14 --> 02:00:53.70
They're not even shooting.

1869
02:00:53.70 --> 02:00:55.74
But they are throwing you.

1870
02:00:55.74 --> 02:00:56.74
Right.

1871
02:00:56.74 --> 02:00:58.06
And they don't have to grab the gear to do it.

1872
02:00:58.06 --> 02:01:00.46
So Greco, that's Greco's awesome.

1873
02:01:00.46 --> 02:01:01.46
Yeah.

1874
02:01:01.46 --> 02:01:02.46
Yeah.

1875
02:01:02.46 --> 02:01:11.46
And then also the judo thing, it tends to, in my experience, take less out of you.

1876
02:01:11.46 --> 02:01:12.46
You know.

1877
02:01:12.46 --> 02:01:16.42
Yeah, it's a less, it's somewhere in between judo and wrestling.

1878
02:01:16.42 --> 02:01:17.42
Yeah.

1879
02:01:17.42 --> 02:01:18.42
Is the exertion.

1880
02:01:18.42 --> 02:01:19.42
Yeah.

1881
02:01:19.42 --> 02:01:20.42
General.

1882
02:01:20.42 --> 02:01:21.42
General.

1883
02:01:21.42 --> 02:01:22.42
General.

1884
02:01:22.42 --> 02:01:23.42
Yeah.

1885
02:01:23.42 --> 02:01:24.42
We're making a lot of generalities.

1886
02:01:24.42 --> 02:01:29.42
Please don't go crazy because of some generalities that echo made.

1887
02:01:29.42 --> 02:01:30.42
Yeah.

1888
02:01:30.42 --> 02:01:34.42
Well, I put, wait, are we good there?

1889
02:01:34.42 --> 02:01:35.42
Yeah, I mean, you want to add?

1890
02:01:35.42 --> 02:01:36.42
I have nothing further to add.

1891
02:01:36.42 --> 02:01:37.42
Keep training.

1892
02:01:37.42 --> 02:01:38.42
Everything you can.

1893
02:01:38.42 --> 02:01:39.42
Yeah.

1894
02:01:39.42 --> 02:01:40.42
I like the judo.

1895
02:01:40.42 --> 02:01:42.42
Thumbs up for the judo, though, for sure.

1896
02:01:42.42 --> 02:01:44.42
Question number three.

1897
02:01:44.42 --> 02:01:50.42
What's your recommendation for an employee that is late to work, who usually is late,

1898
02:01:50.42 --> 02:01:56.78
but they're usually a good performer?

1899
02:01:56.78 --> 02:02:02.22
So being late is unacceptable.

1900
02:02:02.22 --> 02:02:06.02
And I tell us when I've worked with the company and they start talking about, we know

1901
02:02:06.02 --> 02:02:08.14
this guy's late for meeting sometimes.

1902
02:02:08.14 --> 02:02:12.98
I always tell him that I was in the military for 21 years and I was literally never late.

1903
02:02:12.98 --> 02:02:14.98
I was literally never late one time.

1904
02:02:14.98 --> 02:02:15.98
Yeah.

1905
02:02:15.98 --> 02:02:16.98
Think about that.

1906
02:02:16.98 --> 02:02:18.98
20 years, never late.

1907
02:02:18.98 --> 02:02:20.98
Never late.

1908
02:02:20.98 --> 02:02:23.98
Any time for anything.

1909
02:02:23.98 --> 02:02:27.98
We would, you know, we would show up at work in the morning so early that even if it were

1910
02:02:27.98 --> 02:02:34.98
case scenario, my, I got teabone on the way to work, I would still be able to get insurance,

1911
02:02:34.98 --> 02:02:39.98
get everything covered, get a cab and still show up and be an hour earlier.

1912
02:02:39.98 --> 02:02:47.98
So you should be, you're right in the fact that being on time is definitely very, very important.

1913
02:02:47.98 --> 02:02:48.98
So people shouldn't be late.

1914
02:02:48.98 --> 02:02:53.98
So now with this individual, you got someone that's showing up late for work, you got it.

1915
02:02:53.98 --> 02:03:03.98
Like any other leadership challenge, what I would attack is making sure they understand why, why is an important.

1916
02:03:03.98 --> 02:03:08.98
Some people never make the connection as to why being on time is important.

1917
02:03:08.98 --> 02:03:12.98
So you got to explain to them why it's important.

1918
02:03:12.98 --> 02:03:20.98
You got to explain to them that's basic respect for other people's time that it's a basic operational readiness

1919
02:03:20.98 --> 02:03:35.98
is to follow a timeline that it's about being prepared, that it's about showing your reliability and your professionalism to other people that you're working with inside and outside of your company.

1920
02:03:35.98 --> 02:03:39.98
And even Sunsu.

1921
02:03:39.98 --> 02:03:40.98
Sunsu.

1922
02:03:40.98 --> 02:03:47.98
And I didn't say this during the, during the podcast that we did about Sunsu.

1923
02:03:47.98 --> 02:03:52.98
And I can't believe I didn't say it because I always believe in the wake and upper early and being early.

1924
02:03:52.98 --> 02:04:01.98
And Sunsu said that he who is waiting on the battlefield is going to win and who he is rushing late to the battlefield is going to lose.

1925
02:04:01.98 --> 02:04:07.98
Well, that's the way your life is to. And if you're rushing and you things are disorganized and you're running late.

1926
02:04:07.98 --> 02:04:09.98
It's horrible.

1927
02:04:09.98 --> 02:04:16.98
But if you wake up early and you show up early and you're ready and you're prepared and you're waiting on the battlefield, you're going to win.

1928
02:04:16.98 --> 02:04:18.98
That's all there is to it.

1929
02:04:18.98 --> 02:04:22.98
So those the important things that you have to explain to your employee.

1930
02:04:22.98 --> 02:04:32.98
That they so that they understand why being late isn't unacceptable and why being on time is the standard that needs to be maintained.

1931
02:04:32.98 --> 02:04:40.98
Some people it's a horrible habit that some people have of being late. It's a horrible habit.

1932
02:04:40.98 --> 02:04:41.98
Yeah.

1933
02:04:41.98 --> 02:04:42.98
You don't want to get into it.

1934
02:04:42.98 --> 02:04:45.98
It just just unreliability.

1935
02:04:45.98 --> 02:04:46.98
Yeah.

1936
02:04:46.98 --> 02:04:56.98
That's one of those people. I saw him in the nightclub in here, San Diego downtown for a while too, for like seven years.

1937
02:04:56.98 --> 02:05:01.98
And unlike you, I feel like I feel like I don't know. I don't I don't gauge it or not.

1938
02:05:01.98 --> 02:05:06.98
I'm counting but it feels like I was late at the very least one minute late.

1939
02:05:06.98 --> 02:05:07.98
You know, you have a shift right?

1940
02:05:07.98 --> 02:05:08.98
Yeah.

1941
02:05:08.98 --> 02:05:09.98
It starts at whatever time.

1942
02:05:09.98 --> 02:05:11.98
Either one minute late or ten minutes late.

1943
02:05:11.98 --> 02:05:15.98
I feel like I was more late more times than I was on time.

1944
02:05:15.98 --> 02:05:16.98
Yeah.

1945
02:05:16.98 --> 02:05:19.98
So my dad was always late.

1946
02:05:19.98 --> 02:05:23.98
I come from a long line of late guys.

1947
02:05:23.98 --> 02:05:24.98
Nonetheless.

1948
02:05:24.98 --> 02:05:27.98
But I was this guy. I was the guy was a good performer.

1949
02:05:27.98 --> 02:05:31.98
I felt like, according to my bosses and stuff and I would do well.

1950
02:05:31.98 --> 02:05:35.98
Other than the time thing, I was pretty reliable.

1951
02:05:35.98 --> 02:05:38.98
Very real Apple in the nightclub industry.

1952
02:05:38.98 --> 02:05:48.98
And I'd always justify it. Man, all this time I would take to be prepared to get there and find parking and all this stuff.

1953
02:05:48.98 --> 02:05:52.98
I could be doing something else in my life or whatever.

1954
02:05:52.98 --> 02:05:54.98
Not necessarily useful stuff, but just something else.

1955
02:05:54.98 --> 02:05:56.98
Why do I have to work while I'm not working?

1956
02:05:56.98 --> 02:05:58.98
You know, like preparing for work.

1957
02:05:58.98 --> 02:05:59.98
I don't know.

1958
02:05:59.98 --> 02:06:00.98
That was kind of my attitude.

1959
02:06:00.98 --> 02:06:04.98
As long as I have good output as long as my job is being done, it's fine.

1960
02:06:04.98 --> 02:06:09.98
So when I stopped the, you know, when I was done with the nightclub industry,

1961
02:06:09.98 --> 02:06:26.98
Jade, my brother would, he explained it to me where, and the thing that I really kind of hit me was being late is a blatant disregard and a blatant display of disrespect to the person or people who are waiting for you.

1962
02:06:26.98 --> 02:06:27.98
No doubt about that.

1963
02:06:27.98 --> 02:06:32.98
To their time, which is time is like, when you really think about it, it's the most valuable thing you have.

1964
02:06:32.98 --> 02:06:37.98
So even if you're talking about one minute or you're talking about one hour, you are wasting that person's time.

1965
02:06:37.98 --> 02:06:41.98
If you have a meeting or something, you can show up five minutes late.

1966
02:06:41.98 --> 02:06:42.98
People are waiting for you to start the meeting.

1967
02:06:42.98 --> 02:06:46.98
That's five minutes gone, where, you know, we still have to go over that material.

1968
02:06:46.98 --> 02:06:52.98
So we're going to spend an extra five minutes just because you're relate because you failed to prepare everyone else was there on time.

1969
02:06:52.98 --> 02:06:56.98
And you're the one doing it, you know, so, and then also I learned through,

1970
02:06:56.98 --> 02:06:58.98
I want to say it was a book I read.

1971
02:06:58.98 --> 02:07:10.98
I forget where, but where one of the two major, the main things that ensure your success or we'll get in the way of your success is reliability being reliable.

1972
02:07:10.98 --> 02:07:13.98
So, and one day I went to the store, right?

1973
02:07:13.98 --> 02:07:19.98
My wife sends me in the shopping spree. She says, get this kind of tomatoes, I can't tomatoes, but it was like a specific kind.

1974
02:07:19.98 --> 02:07:23.98
You ever try to go to shop for canned tomatoes, bro, there's like this one and this one and this one.

1975
02:07:23.98 --> 02:07:29.98
I'm just going to either just grab one, anyone, because I can't find this one or I'm not going to get them at all.

1976
02:07:29.98 --> 02:07:31.98
I'm just going to go home and be like, you get to tomatoes if you.

1977
02:07:31.98 --> 02:07:33.98
I don't even want whatever it is you're making with it.

1978
02:07:33.98 --> 02:07:39.98
So, I'm getting frustrated on the inside.

1979
02:07:39.98 --> 02:07:49.98
Like, down the line of frustrating things that I've told myself all the way to the point of, this isn't my job to do this.

1980
02:07:49.98 --> 02:07:51.98
It is my job, I'd like it.

1981
02:07:51.98 --> 02:07:55.98
This is my job, I don't want tomatoes. Why should I, why am I even shopping right now?

1982
02:07:55.98 --> 02:07:57.98
Why are you telling the story?

1983
02:07:57.98 --> 02:08:03.98
I'm making a point and in my opinion is a very important point.

1984
02:08:03.98 --> 02:08:10.98
So, if I do that, if I'm like, you know what's great, I'm not getting the tomatoes or I'm just going to go ahead and settle for the wrong one.

1985
02:08:10.98 --> 02:08:15.98
I've demonstrated and basically proclaimed that I'm unreliable.

1986
02:08:15.98 --> 02:08:17.98
So why would anyone come to me for anything?

1987
02:08:17.98 --> 02:08:22.98
Who's to say I'm going to be reliable about it and sure you might be reliable on some things,

1988
02:08:22.98 --> 02:08:28.98
but you've demonstrated that you can and will be unreliable under certain circumstances.

1989
02:08:28.98 --> 02:08:31.98
And those circumstances are dictated by you.

1990
02:08:31.98 --> 02:08:35.98
So who knows? Really? You're not going to get hired?

1991
02:08:35.98 --> 02:08:36.98
No, you're not.

1992
02:08:36.98 --> 02:08:38.98
You might not even be somebody's friend.

1993
02:08:38.98 --> 02:08:44.98
When you think about it or husband or whatever, you know?

1994
02:08:44.98 --> 02:08:53.98
Yeah, definitely it shows lack of being on time shows a total disrespect for other people's time and it shows a lack of reliability on your part.

1995
02:08:53.98 --> 02:08:59.98
So these are the kind of things you've got to explain to your subordinates or explain to this person that's being constantly laid.

1996
02:08:59.98 --> 02:09:04.98
So that they understand why you're telling them that and then you they can then they can improve and then you could,

1997
02:09:04.98 --> 02:09:10.98
you know, if the person's a good performer generally, that means it's a type of person that care about how they're perceived and doing a good job.

1998
02:09:10.98 --> 02:09:21.98
So let's get them to understand how being laid affects everybody else and affects their own reputation as a performer.

1999
02:09:21.98 --> 02:09:24.98
Yeah, sort of mean something to them.

2000
02:09:24.98 --> 02:09:30.98
Plus you'll be a come through guy. Everyone likes to come through guy who comes through.

2001
02:09:30.98 --> 02:09:33.98
I'm sure they liked you for coming in on time every single day for 20 years.

2002
02:09:33.98 --> 02:09:35.98
They did. They did.

2003
02:09:35.98 --> 02:09:45.98
Next question. Okay, you stated in prior podcasts that you are grateful for an understanding wife who allowed you to treat your seal career as the number one priority.

2004
02:09:45.98 --> 02:09:51.98
Do you believe that marriage and children should bring about a reprioritization of your life?

2005
02:09:51.98 --> 02:09:56.98
Given that marriage now brings another person on your life, a partner,

2006
02:09:56.98 --> 02:10:01.98
but also someone who relies on you and especially children who heavily rely on you.

2007
02:10:01.98 --> 02:10:05.98
How did you reconcile still treating the seals as a number one priority?

2008
02:10:05.98 --> 02:10:09.98
Both a wife and children you brought willing to willingly into your life.

2009
02:10:09.98 --> 02:10:16.98
Was there a point that despite having an understanding wife that you should have made the decision to end the seal career early?

2010
02:10:16.98 --> 02:10:20.98
Because of people you have a new fund responsibility for.

2011
02:10:20.98 --> 02:10:25.98
Debate a responsibility greater than the responsibility for your career.

2012
02:10:25.98 --> 02:10:34.98
So this is something that can be hard for people to understand.

2013
02:10:34.98 --> 02:10:49.98
But yes, the seal teams was my number one priority over my family, over my wife, over my kids, over my own life, over everything.

2014
02:10:49.98 --> 02:11:05.98
And just FYI, I literally told my wife that before we got married multiple times on the way to the chapel or to the San Diego Courthouse to get married on the way there on the bridge driving from Coronado San Diego.

2015
02:11:05.98 --> 02:11:10.98
I said, hey, listen, I just want to give you one last chance.

2016
02:11:10.98 --> 02:11:19.98
Being a seal is not just what I do, it's who I am and you are not going to change me so don't think that I'm going to change.

2017
02:11:19.98 --> 02:11:22.98
And she was like, oh, I know, I know what you are.

2018
02:11:22.98 --> 02:11:25.98
You still want to do this? Yes, let's go do it.

2019
02:11:25.98 --> 02:11:33.98
And what was good was to her credit, she didn't try and challenge that, she didn't try and fight that.

2020
02:11:33.98 --> 02:11:42.98
She gave that to me. She understood it and it's probably one of the reasons why we stayed married for so long.

2021
02:11:42.98 --> 02:11:49.98
And a lot of mean to seal teams if you don't know this has about a 90% divorce rate, it's an astronomical divorce rate.

2022
02:11:49.98 --> 02:11:58.98
And the reason a lot of it is because the guys are so dedicated to the seal teams that everything else starts taking a second a back seat.

2023
02:11:58.98 --> 02:12:07.98
Now, I think that my wife actually saw that I was loyal and I was dedicated to the seal teams and therefore she saw that as something that was positive.

2024
02:12:07.98 --> 02:12:12.98
And something that would transfer over to other parts of my life and go to my family.

2025
02:12:12.98 --> 02:12:18.98
Now to answer more on this guy's question, I want to think about this.

2026
02:12:18.98 --> 02:12:27.98
Being a seal, the best thing I could do for my family was be dedicated to my job.

2027
02:12:27.98 --> 02:12:32.98
It was the best thing I could do for the other seals I worked with.

2028
02:12:32.98 --> 02:12:38.98
It was the best thing I could do for myself and for my family was to be the best seal possible. Why?

2029
02:12:38.98 --> 02:12:41.98
Because we're going into combat.

2030
02:12:41.98 --> 02:12:54.98
And if I want to come home alive to my family and I want my brothers to come home alive to their families, the best thing we could possibly do for our families is to be totally dedicated to the jobs that we're ready.

2031
02:12:54.98 --> 02:12:59.98
And we can bring each other back.

2032
02:12:59.98 --> 02:13:04.98
So, I, that's the way it is.

2033
02:13:04.98 --> 02:13:08.98
And I would stand by that to this day.

2034
02:13:08.98 --> 02:13:16.98
And it actually does transfer in many cases to normal civilian careers.

2035
02:13:16.98 --> 02:13:25.98
Because being hardworking and being dedicated to your job generally is going to translate to being more successful in your job.

2036
02:13:25.98 --> 02:13:28.98
And if you're more successful in your job, you have more financial stability.

2037
02:13:28.98 --> 02:13:34.98
Right? If you have more financial stability, I mean, how many flights in families take place because of finances?

2038
02:13:34.98 --> 02:13:41.98
I mean, I think that's probably the leading cause of problems and families is there's a, there's financial strain.

2039
02:13:41.98 --> 02:13:52.98
And so, I think that it does translate somewhat to people in their normal careers, even if they're not seals, even not preparing for war, that they're trying to do a good job.

2040
02:13:52.98 --> 02:13:59.98
They're being dedicated to their jobs so that they can perform better and have more stability in their lives.

2041
02:13:59.98 --> 02:14:02.98
And by the way, when you work harder, you get rewarded more.

2042
02:14:02.98 --> 02:14:07.98
It also eventually translates into more freedom because you move into a leadership position.

2043
02:14:07.98 --> 02:14:13.98
Maybe you go into a situation where you're no longer working for somebody directly and they're over you.

2044
02:14:13.98 --> 02:14:15.98
And they're demanding now, listen, you get a little more freedom.

2045
02:14:15.98 --> 02:14:18.98
You can dictate what happens in your life more.

2046
02:14:18.98 --> 02:14:20.98
So that's important as well.

2047
02:14:20.98 --> 02:14:33.98
And also, on top of all that, guess what? The way you act and the way you care yourself, you are actually teaching your family and your children something.

2048
02:14:33.98 --> 02:14:41.98
Now, if you're a warrior, if you're a military guy, if you're a, then your children guess what?

2049
02:14:41.98 --> 02:14:49.98
Warriors have been going away to war for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

2050
02:14:49.98 --> 02:14:54.98
And people have been just fine from that.

2051
02:14:54.98 --> 02:15:00.98
Men have been raised by their moms because their dad was going away to war.

2052
02:15:00.98 --> 02:15:03.98
That's the way it is.

2053
02:15:03.98 --> 02:15:06.98
So I think that that's okay.

2054
02:15:06.98 --> 02:15:13.98
It doesn't mean that the warrior doesn't love his family. He does, but he's got to job the do and he's going to go do it.

2055
02:15:13.98 --> 02:15:18.98
And also, if, again, if you apply that to a normal civilian situation,

2056
02:15:18.98 --> 02:15:25.98
if your children see that you are dedicated, that you are hardworking, that you are loyal,

2057
02:15:25.98 --> 02:15:30.98
that's a positive example that you're setting for your kids.

2058
02:15:30.98 --> 02:15:39.98
Now, of course, the, the shouldn't be thinking and I never came home to my kids and said,

2059
02:15:39.98 --> 02:15:43.98
hey, look, you're number two on the list of priorities around here.

2060
02:15:43.98 --> 02:15:44.98
Right.

2061
02:15:44.98 --> 02:15:46.98
Now, I might have said, listen, I've got a job to do.

2062
02:15:46.98 --> 02:15:49.98
I've got guys that are depending on me.

2063
02:15:49.98 --> 02:15:52.98
We're going to combat bad things can happen.

2064
02:15:52.98 --> 02:15:57.98
I need to be ready and I need to be ready for my guys.

2065
02:15:57.98 --> 02:16:02.98
And I need to be ready for you.

2066
02:16:02.98 --> 02:16:05.98
And so I don't think you need to throw it in people's face and say,

2067
02:16:05.98 --> 02:16:10.98
no, you're number two priority, but your family should understand that you're working hard for them.

2068
02:16:10.98 --> 02:16:15.98
You're building their future. You're building your, you're building a legacy for your family.

2069
02:16:15.98 --> 02:16:18.98
That's what you're doing when you're working hard.

2070
02:16:18.98 --> 02:16:26.98
At any job. So I think that's a good, I think that's a good example to set.

2071
02:16:26.98 --> 02:16:31.98
And I think that there's nothing wrong with that example.

2072
02:16:31.98 --> 02:16:35.98
Now, where people can go too far, which, of course, they can.

2073
02:16:35.98 --> 02:16:37.98
They can do it in the military.

2074
02:16:37.98 --> 02:16:46.98
They can do it in their civilian career, where the job becomes not just the short term.

2075
02:16:46.98 --> 02:16:49.98
Priority.

2076
02:16:49.98 --> 02:16:51.98
Because I will say this.

2077
02:16:51.98 --> 02:16:55.98
My long term priority was my family.

2078
02:16:55.98 --> 02:16:57.98
Right. That was the long term priority.

2079
02:16:57.98 --> 02:16:59.98
I mean, I had these, you know, my wife and kids.

2080
02:16:59.98 --> 02:17:02.98
I'm going to raise them. They're going to be with me forever.

2081
02:17:02.98 --> 02:17:04.98
That's what I'm doing with my life.

2082
02:17:04.98 --> 02:17:07.98
So the long term priority is definitely the family.

2083
02:17:07.98 --> 02:17:10.98
But the short term priority, and by short team, I'm talking years.

2084
02:17:10.98 --> 02:17:12.98
Right. Two, three, five years, three years.

2085
02:17:12.98 --> 02:17:16.98
That's a long, that's a short term priority compared to your family,

2086
02:17:16.98 --> 02:17:20.98
which is going to be with you until you die.

2087
02:17:20.98 --> 02:17:24.98
And so I think you need to keep that in mind and make sure that you're not

2088
02:17:24.98 --> 02:17:29.98
sack-refacing things long term.

2089
02:17:29.98 --> 02:17:33.98
In other words, if you're going to destroy your marriage because you're working so hard,

2090
02:17:33.98 --> 02:17:37.98
you got problems. If you're going to destroy your marriage because you're dedicated

2091
02:17:37.98 --> 02:17:41.98
too much to your job, that's not, that's not supporting the long term

2092
02:17:41.98 --> 02:17:45.98
strategy of taking care of your family.

2093
02:17:45.98 --> 02:17:49.98
So that's sort of where I come out on that.

2094
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.98
And again, tons of credit to my wife and my kids who were, you know,

2095
02:17:54.98 --> 02:17:57.98
I was gone all the time and they dealt with it.

2096
02:17:57.98 --> 02:17:59.98
And guess what? I'm gone a lot too now.

2097
02:17:59.98 --> 02:18:01.98
I'm traveling all the time.

2098
02:18:01.98 --> 02:18:06.98
And again, they all know that, hey, I'd love to be staying home with them.

2099
02:18:06.98 --> 02:18:09.98
But I've got to take care of the family.

2100
02:18:09.98 --> 02:18:17.98
I've got to support the family. I've got to maintain my situation so that I can take care of

2101
02:18:17.98 --> 02:18:19.98
them if something bad were to happen.

2102
02:18:19.98 --> 02:18:20.98
Yeah.

2103
02:18:20.98 --> 02:18:21.98
But I think they understand that.

2104
02:18:21.98 --> 02:18:25.98
Yeah. And that's a, I think that's a big component where, you know,

2105
02:18:25.98 --> 02:18:27.98
your wife and your kids, they do understand.

2106
02:18:27.98 --> 02:18:31.98
And I'm assuming, I mean, given, you know, what I know about you guys is that

2107
02:18:31.98 --> 02:18:35.98
that you're, you're pretty clear through what you say and what you do that you

2108
02:18:35.98 --> 02:18:38.98
are supporting them and they are a part of you're like, you know, because some people,

2109
02:18:38.98 --> 02:18:41.98
let's say, I don't know, just this is a hypothetical situation, but let's say a

2110
02:18:41.98 --> 02:18:43.98
cop, right? Or detective.

2111
02:18:43.98 --> 02:18:46.98
He's willing to his job. He's frustrated with the job and the school's free

2112
02:18:46.98 --> 02:18:47.98
to job.

2113
02:18:47.98 --> 02:18:50.98
He comes home. He's frustrated because whatever works stuff.

2114
02:18:50.98 --> 02:18:54.98
He comes home, but he's not dedicated to his relationship or his family that

2115
02:18:54.98 --> 02:19:00.98
much. So he allows the frustrations of work to carry over.

2116
02:19:00.98 --> 02:19:03.98
Carry over. He takes it out on his wife because she said, you know, do the

2117
02:19:03.98 --> 02:19:07.98
dishes. You forgot whatever. She, and then he's even more man because he's frustrated

2118
02:19:07.98 --> 02:19:11.98
with work. Like that kind of thing where, you know, he kind of, in the back of his

2119
02:19:11.98 --> 02:19:15.98
mind, he regards his family as something that should, I don't know, serve him

2120
02:19:15.98 --> 02:19:20.98
while he does his, you know, real life in life, which is being amazing

2121
02:19:20.98 --> 02:19:23.98
detected. You know, so I think a lot of times there's that.

2122
02:19:23.98 --> 02:19:29.98
And then on top of it, the, the family wife will just say that the wife

2123
02:19:29.98 --> 02:19:34.98
has these expectations that are not clear, not not correct. But it that way.

2124
02:19:34.98 --> 02:19:38.98
You know, where, you know, you should be home at a certain time.

2125
02:19:38.98 --> 02:19:42.98
You know, you shouldn't be working late. That was your family.

2126
02:19:42.98 --> 02:19:46.98
That's the worst is like, I'm not coming home. Like, oh, I'm done with work in the

2127
02:19:46.98 --> 02:19:50.98
school teams. I'm done with work. But I'm going to the bar with the guys and I'll

2128
02:19:50.98 --> 02:19:54.98
be home and midnight or want to clock in the morning or two o'clock in

2129
02:19:54.98 --> 02:19:59.98
the morning. Yeah. And guess what? My wife actually understood that. She actually understood

2130
02:19:59.98 --> 02:20:04.98
that, hey, these guys are a team. These guys are a family of their own right.

2131
02:20:04.98 --> 02:20:10.98
And I got to let him go and develop and hang out with his friends because he's got to

2132
02:20:10.98 --> 02:20:13.98
know these guys better than anybody in the world. Yeah, seeing that, that's the

2133
02:20:13.98 --> 02:20:18.98
hard thing for for some people to handle. Yeah. And now when you got to be

2134
02:20:18.98 --> 02:20:23.98
careful with maybe seals to me, yeah. That's, it's absolutely true and legitimate.

2135
02:20:23.98 --> 02:20:27.98
But some guys might use that as like an excuse just to not have to come home and

2136
02:20:27.98 --> 02:20:31.98
wash dishes. Of course. Yeah. And they're, then they're all right. Right.

2137
02:20:31.98 --> 02:20:34.98
So, you know, kind of be careful with that one. Like, um, you know, I don't know.

2138
02:20:34.98 --> 02:20:39.98
It's a sales guy. He closes the deal and guys want to celebrate.

2139
02:20:39.98 --> 02:20:42.98
You know, meanwhile, it's done in a mother's day or something.

2140
02:20:42.98 --> 02:20:47.98
No, something or something. Or Thursday. You need that.

2141
02:20:47.98 --> 02:20:54.98
You know, and, you know, they, I don't think it's unreasonable for wives to have certain expectations.

2142
02:20:54.98 --> 02:20:57.98
Especially if you don't address them like, you know, you don't communicate or whatever.

2143
02:20:57.98 --> 02:21:02.98
Like, yeah, I've expectation for your husband to come home after work. You do.

2144
02:21:02.98 --> 02:21:07.98
So if he just doesn't shell up all of a sudden, you know, I mean, you're, I'm assuming you're

2145
02:21:07.98 --> 02:21:11.98
going to tell your wife, hey, I'm not going to, this is why, just like, are you saying, you're going to

2146
02:21:11.98 --> 02:21:16.98
explain everything. But some guys are like, I'm the man. I don't have to come home

2147
02:21:16.98 --> 02:21:21.98
now if I don't want to, which is kind of true, but you're in a relationship. You're in a team.

2148
02:21:21.98 --> 02:21:26.98
Yeah, and really I would say one thing that's awesome about my wife is I would say, oh, yeah,

2149
02:21:26.98 --> 02:21:29.98
sorry, I didn't come home. I was going out with the boys.

2150
02:21:29.98 --> 02:21:38.98
Yeah. And she was independent enough and secure enough and confident enough that she was like, oh,

2151
02:21:38.98 --> 02:21:42.98
okay, whatever. Hey, I'm going to do this. Most of the time.

2152
02:21:42.98 --> 02:21:47.98
Yeah. There was sometimes flowers were bought. Things were, things were rebuilt.

2153
02:21:47.98 --> 02:21:51.98
You know, because, you know, it's, it's life.

2154
02:21:51.98 --> 02:21:57.98
Right. Yeah. And no one's going to be like 100% focused on that, you know, that situation or

2155
02:21:57.98 --> 02:22:03.98
the, you know, you go, how you say, you said, I'm a Navy SEAL don't, you know, don't

2156
02:22:03.98 --> 02:22:08.98
change me or whatever. She, that's not going to be on the front of her mind, 100% of the

2157
02:22:08.98 --> 02:22:13.98
life. She has, she's a person, you know, and they, these people always think they can change you.

2158
02:22:13.98 --> 02:22:18.98
Oh, yeah. And even if they know ultimately, they can't, they still for a day they might,

2159
02:22:18.98 --> 02:22:23.98
you know, and it can go back, you know, so back and forth. So, yeah, it's not going to go perfect.

2160
02:22:23.98 --> 02:22:28.98
But as long as like how you're saying, you communicated that early and she is a strong enough

2161
02:22:28.98 --> 02:22:32.98
person to be like, understand that and understand the value of that throughout the whole

2162
02:22:32.98 --> 02:22:35.98
process. And, you know, then you're going to have success with that kind of thing.

2163
02:22:35.98 --> 02:22:42.98
But it depends on how good you communicate it and how willing your wife or husband or whatever

2164
02:22:42.98 --> 02:22:47.98
situation is depends on how good they can receive it and go through it. Yeah.

2165
02:22:47.98 --> 02:22:52.98
It's not before needy men. Yeah. And you know, though, a lot of military, I've been talking

2166
02:22:52.98 --> 02:23:00.98
to a lot of military people that listen to the podcast spouses and service members. And so,

2167
02:23:00.98 --> 02:23:07.98
yeah, guess what? Give your service member some room to form those bonds to be dedicated

2168
02:23:07.98 --> 02:23:13.98
to that job because they are truly doing it for you. They really are. They're doing it for

2169
02:23:13.98 --> 02:23:21.98
you. And now service members, as Echo just said, don't abuse the privilege. Don't abuse it.

2170
02:23:21.98 --> 02:23:27.98
Do what you got to do. Be the best you can be at your job bond with your brothers and

2171
02:23:27.98 --> 02:23:33.98
arms without your going on the battlefield with whether you're a cop, whether you're a

2172
02:23:33.98 --> 02:23:39.98
firefighter, build those bonds. But of course, don't abuse it and make sure you take

2173
02:23:39.98 --> 02:23:43.98
your family too. Yeah.

2174
02:23:43.98 --> 02:23:50.98
Juckle, can you lead those that don't want to be led? It's so hot.

2175
02:23:50.98 --> 02:24:04.98
The beauty of that question is in its simplicity. And the answer is yes. And no. You can't lead

2176
02:24:04.98 --> 02:24:12.98
them in the traditional sense. You have to be indirect. Again, there's our word.

2177
02:24:12.98 --> 02:24:16.98
You have to be indirect. Meaning you can't say, hey, you need to do this.

2178
02:24:16.98 --> 02:24:22.98
Or hey, I order you to do that. You need to be indirect. And the best way to do that

2179
02:24:22.98 --> 02:24:30.98
with people that do not want to be led is to let them lead. Put them in a

2180
02:24:30.98 --> 02:24:34.98
leadership role. Say, hey, you know what? You're really good at this. I think you've got

2181
02:24:34.98 --> 02:24:40.98
a good vision here. Can you run this? Can you lead this? And then once they're in

2182
02:24:40.98 --> 02:24:46.98
a leadership role, then you can make suggestions and you can subtly steer them as they

2183
02:24:46.98 --> 02:24:52.98
lead. But important point is that you actually have to be ready to let them lead.

2184
02:24:52.98 --> 02:24:56.98
You can't just be like, oh, I want you to run this. And then all of a sudden you go

2185
02:24:56.98 --> 02:25:02.98
all level seven micro management on people. You have to let them lead. You have to let it go.

2186
02:25:02.98 --> 02:25:12.98
Let them go. Now, you do need to make sure that they're being safe. You know, or

2187
02:25:12.98 --> 02:25:16.98
make sure that they're being profitable. Make sure they're not doing anything illegal

2188
02:25:16.98 --> 02:25:22.98
or a greasest in what they're doing. But you have to let them lead. You have to let them make decisions.

2189
02:25:22.98 --> 02:25:30.98
And so that is my first suggestion is to put them in a leadership role. Now, if there's no way to put them in a leadership role,

2190
02:25:30.98 --> 02:25:36.98
then let them lead their little part of the mission. Whatever that is, let them tell you how they

2191
02:25:36.98 --> 02:25:42.98
are going to do things. And again, you can make little course corrections along the way, but you need

2192
02:25:42.98 --> 02:25:50.98
to let them lead. Now, one of the hardest parts of both these situations is guess what your ego

2193
02:25:50.98 --> 02:25:58.98
because guess what you want to be the leader. You are offended by someone that doesn't want to

2194
02:25:58.98 --> 02:26:04.98
be led. Look, why aren't they listening to me? I am awesome. I am the leader. I'm in charge. I

2195
02:26:04.98 --> 02:26:10.98
will rank them. Why aren't they listening to me? All those are little insecurities that you have.

2196
02:26:10.98 --> 02:26:18.98
About your own leadership capabilities don't let it happen. I was never offended

2197
02:26:18.98 --> 02:26:26.98
by subordinates that I had that wanted to lead more. That wanted my job. I wanted them to want to have my

2198
02:26:26.98 --> 02:26:34.98
job. I wanted them to want to have my job. I wanted them to be able to take my job from me. That's

2199
02:26:34.98 --> 02:26:40.98
what I wanted. If they're doing that good, I can look upwards and outwards and focus on other things. Good.

2200
02:26:40.98 --> 02:26:46.98
Come and take my job. Be good enough to take my job. And if I ever send to myself, well, I can't

2201
02:26:46.98 --> 02:26:50.98
believe this guy is trying to step up and take my job. I realized, oh my god, I'm being insecure.

2202
02:26:50.98 --> 02:26:56.98
I need to put my own ego in check because you know what? If they can step up and do my job,

2203
02:26:56.98 --> 02:27:04.98
good, I'll step up and do the next person's job. So when somebody below you doesn't want to be led,

2204
02:27:04.98 --> 02:27:16.98
let them lead and be happy that they want to lead. Give them that leadership. That's what you do with people that don't want to be led.

2205
02:27:16.98 --> 02:27:32.98
I just thought of a riddle. I kind of got it from Twitter than made it into a joke. What kind of stake does

2206
02:27:32.98 --> 02:27:48.98
jocally? Ribby. Flank stake. Oh, I like it. I like it. Good solid question. That's one year a lot.

2207
02:27:48.98 --> 02:27:54.98
Yeah, and I said that obviously, but that's kind of like leading by way of flying. Oh, sure.

2208
02:27:54.98 --> 02:28:00.98
It's like you don't lead them directly how you would traditionally, whatever. You're kind of letting them lead.

2209
02:28:00.98 --> 02:28:08.98
Yes, you will. Yes, you will. I mean, the people that are like this, these are people that are either

2210
02:28:08.98 --> 02:28:14.98
have a big ego or maybe they know more than you. Maybe they're more or more experienced and you maybe they really do know more than you.

2211
02:28:14.98 --> 02:28:22.98
And they're bummed or angry because they've you've been promoted above them. So now what am I going to do? I'm going to be a jerk.

2212
02:28:22.98 --> 02:28:30.98
That's what I'm going to do. And so, you know, I'm not going to support your plan. I'm not going to do what you tell me to do and I'm going to have my own way of doing things.

2213
02:28:30.98 --> 02:28:38.98
That's what's going to happen. So don't let that happen. All you got to do is say, listen man, really respect what you've done. You've been doing this longer than I have.

2214
02:28:38.98 --> 02:28:45.98
You know what, can you can you run with us? Can you plan this? Can you execute this? That'd be awesome.

2215
02:28:45.98 --> 02:28:56.98
And then they go, oh, okay. Now, do they think, oh, that's right. He's in the 80. He doesn't know what he's doing. No, not what you do it right. Not what you say, hey, you have more experience in me.

2216
02:28:56.98 --> 02:29:04.98
I would really like you to lead this instead of me. How's that sound? You can only pull that off if you're secure in your own leadership.

2217
02:29:04.98 --> 02:29:07.98
Yeah. It's a way it works.

2218
02:29:07.98 --> 02:29:10.98
Just flank them.

2219
02:29:10.98 --> 02:29:14.98
Flank, flank, stile at least.

2220
02:29:14.98 --> 02:29:19.98
Next question.

2221
02:29:19.98 --> 02:29:28.98
Jockel, your podcast listeners and Twitter followers know you're before five daily, meaning you're up before five.

2222
02:29:28.98 --> 02:29:34.98
Work out essentially every day and are devoted to the student of Jiu-Jitsu.

2223
02:29:34.98 --> 02:29:41.98
What relationship do you see between physical fitness and empowering the mind slash will?

2224
02:29:41.98 --> 02:29:47.98
When a man commits really commits to changing his fitness, what else changes?

2225
02:29:47.98 --> 02:29:54.98
Well, you heard Bob Hoffman talk about this a bunch tonight. This book, Bob Hoffman wrote the book.

2226
02:29:54.98 --> 02:30:01.98
I remember the last war and he wrote the book, how to be strong, healthy and happy.

2227
02:30:01.98 --> 02:30:12.98
There's no doubt that physical fitness is going to help you in every fast away, especially in terms of what you're talking about, empowering the mind and the will.

2228
02:30:12.98 --> 02:30:15.98
Working out is a test of will.

2229
02:30:15.98 --> 02:30:22.98
Right? I mean, it is going to see can you push yourself harder? Can you get the last rep? Can you shave another second off the sprint?

2230
02:30:22.98 --> 02:30:28.98
Can you lift a little bit heavier? That's, that's what working out is it's a test of will.

2231
02:30:28.98 --> 02:30:34.98
And that test of will, and you've heard me say this before starts before the workout starts.

2232
02:30:34.98 --> 02:30:42.98
It starts when the alarm goes off. Can you get out of bed in the morning? These are all little tests of discipline and of will.

2233
02:30:42.98 --> 02:30:53.98
And as we've talked about before discipline, begets more discipline. The stronger you get, the stronger you get.

2234
02:30:53.98 --> 02:30:58.98
And physical will, that it takes to get through these workouts that it takes to get out of bed in the morning.

2235
02:30:58.98 --> 02:31:05.98
That carries over to mental will. So you can eat better foods. You can get worked on. So you can control your temper.

2236
02:31:05.98 --> 02:31:11.98
So you can create things and improve things and you can be better.

2237
02:31:11.98 --> 02:31:16.98
Now, I remember a while ago speaking of Twitter.

2238
02:31:16.98 --> 02:31:29.98
I posted a picture of early morning workout, got done. And then I posted a picture of a little the post surf session.

2239
02:31:29.98 --> 02:31:37.98
And then I posted a picture of post jujitsu session. And you know, so these were all like three posts in a row.

2240
02:31:37.98 --> 02:31:42.98
And someone made some kind of a comment that was kind of along the lines of,

2241
02:31:42.98 --> 02:31:49.98
oh, must be rough, right? Must be a rough life. You know, you're getting up. You're just surfing and doing jujitsu.

2242
02:31:49.98 --> 02:31:55.98
And honestly, when I saw that when someone wrote that, I kind of felt bad.

2243
02:31:55.98 --> 02:32:01.98
I kind of felt guilty in a way.

2244
02:32:01.98 --> 02:32:08.98
Because here I am. I'm going surfing. I'm working now. I'm training jujitsu. I'm kind of living the dream.

2245
02:32:08.98 --> 02:32:16.98
Or in fact, in my mind, I actually am living my dream doing what I want to do when I want to do it.

2246
02:32:16.98 --> 02:32:22.98
And then there's other people out there that are grinding that are either overseas,

2247
02:32:22.98 --> 02:32:26.98
that are in combat, that are working, that are doing jobs that they don't like.

2248
02:32:26.98 --> 02:32:30.98
They're working with people that they can't stand in a cubicle somewhere.

2249
02:32:30.98 --> 02:32:36.98
Whatever is that doing in here, I was almost, I felt like damn I'm rubbing this in people's faces.

2250
02:32:36.98 --> 02:32:41.98
And I actually felt bad, I was like, I can't be doing that again.

2251
02:32:41.98 --> 02:32:48.98
And someone else on Twitter came on the same thread or whatever.

2252
02:32:48.98 --> 02:32:57.98
And said discipline equals freedom. They quoted me.

2253
02:32:57.98 --> 02:33:12.98
And they were right. They made a great point. The reason I'm able to go surfing in the jujitsu and work out and do whatever is because of discipline throughout my life.

2254
02:33:12.98 --> 02:33:19.98
And again, I'm not making no claims right now to be the ultimate success story.

2255
02:33:19.98 --> 02:33:24.98
I'm certainly not. And I will tell you this, you know, I live in a great place right now.

2256
02:33:24.98 --> 02:33:28.98
And I have a lot of time where my wife and I wanted to live down by the beach.

2257
02:33:28.98 --> 02:33:32.98
We've on a house down by the beach, a dump that was barely livable.

2258
02:33:32.98 --> 02:33:36.98
And it was 150 square feet.

2259
02:33:36.98 --> 02:33:40.98
And we had three kids in there and my wife and I are bedroom, are bed.

2260
02:33:40.98 --> 02:33:44.98
When you open the front door to the house and walked into the living room,

2261
02:33:44.98 --> 02:33:46.98
our bedroom is on the floor right there.

2262
02:33:46.98 --> 02:33:49.98
For a few years, we just lived there.

2263
02:33:49.98 --> 02:33:51.98
And now we live in a great house.

2264
02:33:51.98 --> 02:33:55.98
But I have to remind people, like, you know what?

2265
02:33:55.98 --> 02:34:00.98
There was a time where I just was sucking it up and living on Navy pay.

2266
02:34:00.98 --> 02:34:07.98
And we squeezed into this house and borrowed a bunch of money and lived on the floor in the living room.

2267
02:34:07.98 --> 02:34:10.98
But we had that discipline back then.

2268
02:34:10.98 --> 02:34:18.98
And then the discipline eventually becomes a form of freedom.

2269
02:34:18.98 --> 02:34:24.98
And so it wasn't always like this where I was just chilling and surfing and doing jidjitsu and playing guitar.

2270
02:34:24.98 --> 02:34:27.98
And whatever, you know, there was a lot of blood sweat and tears along the way.

2271
02:34:27.98 --> 02:34:32.98
And by the way, the blood sweat and tears along the way, I actually enjoyed.

2272
02:34:32.98 --> 02:34:35.98
I enjoyed. I wouldn't trade it.

2273
02:34:35.98 --> 02:34:41.98
I'm glad that I was putting those situations to do those things.

2274
02:34:41.98 --> 02:34:47.98
And most importantly, this is a very important thing.

2275
02:34:47.98 --> 02:34:49.98
It's available to anybody.

2276
02:34:49.98 --> 02:34:53.98
That life that you want is out there.

2277
02:34:53.98 --> 02:34:56.98
And it might be a few years in the future.

2278
02:34:56.98 --> 02:34:57.98
But it's there.

2279
02:34:57.98 --> 02:34:58.98
And you can get to it.

2280
02:34:58.98 --> 02:35:00.98
And the path.

2281
02:35:00.98 --> 02:35:05.98
The path getting there starts early in the morning.

2282
02:35:05.98 --> 02:35:07.98
And it ends late at night.

2283
02:35:07.98 --> 02:35:10.98
And it requires sacrifice and discipline.

2284
02:35:10.98 --> 02:35:12.98
And it requires force of will.

2285
02:35:12.98 --> 02:35:15.98
And that comes at 430 in the morning when the alarm goes off.

2286
02:35:15.98 --> 02:35:19.98
That's when it comes. So get up and go get it.

2287
02:35:19.98 --> 02:35:29.98
And that's why I think that the idea of physical fitness,

2288
02:35:29.98 --> 02:35:32.98
empowering the mind and the will.

2289
02:35:32.98 --> 02:35:35.98
I think that's what happens when you commit to those things.

2290
02:35:35.98 --> 02:35:39.98
I think the rest of your life will reflect positively on what you've done.

2291
02:35:39.98 --> 02:35:41.98
And go, guess what? I've been real lucky too.

2292
02:35:41.98 --> 02:35:44.98
You know, I've been very lucky long away.

2293
02:35:44.98 --> 02:35:49.98
And I won't say that, you know, I made everything happen myself.

2294
02:35:49.98 --> 02:35:50.98
I got lucky.

2295
02:35:50.98 --> 02:35:52.98
I was blessed in a lot of situations.

2296
02:35:52.98 --> 02:35:53.98
It had good things to happen.

2297
02:35:53.98 --> 02:35:57.98
I mean, for instance, the housing market crashed.

2298
02:35:57.98 --> 02:35:59.98
And I was in the Navy.

2299
02:35:59.98 --> 02:36:00.98
It didn't matter to me.

2300
02:36:00.98 --> 02:36:01.98
I mean, I had a couple houses.

2301
02:36:01.98 --> 02:36:02.98
And I was like, I don't know.

2302
02:36:02.98 --> 02:36:04.98
I didn't even notice there was a housing market crash.

2303
02:36:04.98 --> 02:36:06.98
Once a while I was buying more houses and they were cheaper.

2304
02:36:06.98 --> 02:36:09.98
You know, but it wasn't that was luck.

2305
02:36:09.98 --> 02:36:10.98
Yeah.

2306
02:36:10.98 --> 02:36:11.98
Didn't plan that.

2307
02:36:11.98 --> 02:36:13.98
It was might have been a long-term strategy.

2308
02:36:13.98 --> 02:36:14.98
I wanted to buy houses.

2309
02:36:14.98 --> 02:36:19.98
But, you know, a lot of people got caught upside down and some rough situations in the

2310
02:36:19.98 --> 02:36:20.98
housing market.

2311
02:36:20.98 --> 02:36:23.98
And I was lucky in the fact that I hadn't overextended myself.

2312
02:36:23.98 --> 02:36:26.98
Again, maybe that's partial luck, partial strategy.

2313
02:36:26.98 --> 02:36:28.98
But that's a situation.

2314
02:36:28.98 --> 02:36:33.98
Again, I'm just trying to point out that I know I've been lucky in some of it.

2315
02:36:33.98 --> 02:36:36.98
But let's make our luck with some hard work.

2316
02:36:36.98 --> 02:36:37.98
For sure.

2317
02:36:37.98 --> 02:36:40.98
Yeah, just you pointing that out that you got lucky.

2318
02:36:40.98 --> 02:36:43.98
You know, and you're recognizing it.

2319
02:36:43.98 --> 02:36:46.98
Some people, a lot of people, they don't like, they don't want to recognize all the factors.

2320
02:36:46.98 --> 02:36:50.98
You know, it's just easy to blame something else for what didn't happen.

2321
02:36:50.98 --> 02:36:51.98
And then blame, not blame.

2322
02:36:51.98 --> 02:36:54.98
But take credit yourself for something that does happen.

2323
02:36:54.98 --> 02:36:55.98
Good.

2324
02:36:55.98 --> 02:36:56.98
Yeah.

2325
02:36:56.98 --> 02:36:58.98
So you're recognizing everything.

2326
02:36:58.98 --> 02:37:05.98
Kind of the good of it, which is party, your discipline way of being.

2327
02:37:05.98 --> 02:37:08.98
Back to your Twitter posts situation.

2328
02:37:08.98 --> 02:37:12.98
That was good. That was heavy. That was good right there. I thought.

2329
02:37:12.98 --> 02:37:15.98
And I know thinking about that.

2330
02:37:15.98 --> 02:37:18.98
Someone who posted must be must be rough, right?

2331
02:37:18.98 --> 02:37:19.98
Like a sarcastic.

2332
02:37:19.98 --> 02:37:20.98
Yeah, yeah.

2333
02:37:20.98 --> 02:37:20.98
Yeah.

2334
02:37:20.98 --> 02:37:21.98
Obviously, that was just a fun thing.

2335
02:37:21.98 --> 02:37:22.98
Yeah, yeah.

2336
02:37:22.98 --> 02:37:22.98
Right.

2337
02:37:22.98 --> 02:37:23.98
They weren't being a jerk.

2338
02:37:23.98 --> 02:37:24.98
We are right, right.

2339
02:37:24.98 --> 02:37:25.98
I don't think they were.

2340
02:37:25.98 --> 02:37:26.98
So, so, let's do that.

2341
02:37:26.98 --> 02:37:27.98
But in that other way.

2342
02:37:27.98 --> 02:37:27.98
Yeah.

2343
02:37:27.98 --> 02:37:29.98
And it hit you actually in a good way.

2344
02:37:29.98 --> 02:37:32.98
Some people might be like, hey, I work for this stuff.

2345
02:37:32.98 --> 02:37:33.98
Don't say that.

2346
02:37:33.98 --> 02:37:34.98
You know, take it the wrong way.

2347
02:37:34.98 --> 02:37:35.98
Whatever.

2348
02:37:35.98 --> 02:37:36.98
But you didn't.

2349
02:37:36.98 --> 02:37:39.98
You know, you're going to be a little bit too much.

2350
02:37:39.98 --> 02:37:42.98
Which is, says, yeah, again, more about you and your approach.

2351
02:37:42.98 --> 02:37:46.98
So that being said, let me add a little part to it.

2352
02:37:46.98 --> 02:37:47.98
Where.

2353
02:37:47.98 --> 02:37:50.98
When you look at those Twitter posts like that Twitter post, right?

2354
02:37:50.98 --> 02:37:53.98
You have your, you know, the aftermath of your workout.

2355
02:37:53.98 --> 02:37:56.98
You know, go look at or Instagram whatever.

2356
02:37:56.98 --> 02:38:01.98
Look at every single day of your post, every single day.

2357
02:38:01.98 --> 02:38:05.98
You'll see 434 wake up, you know, workout, 413.

2358
02:38:05.98 --> 02:38:06.98
Every single day.

2359
02:38:06.98 --> 02:38:10.98
And then step one step back and look at all of them while at once.

2360
02:38:10.98 --> 02:38:14.98
That's just the clear picture of your discipline of your, you know, doing it every single day.

2361
02:38:14.98 --> 02:38:19.98
Cause like, okay, I understand I can wake up at 434 tomorrow if I want to.

2362
02:38:19.98 --> 02:38:21.98
And I'll get a workout in and I'll be like, look at me.

2363
02:38:21.98 --> 02:38:22.98
I'm Jocco.

2364
02:38:22.98 --> 02:38:26.98
And then go surfing, go do your job so you eat flank steak.

2365
02:38:26.98 --> 02:38:32.98
But if you expect me to do that every single day and I'm not used to it.

2366
02:38:32.98 --> 02:38:37.98
And I do it that same a lot more.

2367
02:38:37.98 --> 02:38:39.98
And you do that.

2368
02:38:39.98 --> 02:38:41.98
So there's your picture.

2369
02:38:41.98 --> 02:38:42.98
That's what it is.

2370
02:38:42.98 --> 02:38:44.98
Of course, don't focus on just that little narrow view of,

2371
02:38:44.98 --> 02:38:48.98
Oh, how cool it was that he got to do Jitsu surf all day.

2372
02:38:48.98 --> 02:38:49.98
And cruise.

2373
02:38:49.98 --> 02:38:50.98
Look at the big picture.

2374
02:38:50.98 --> 02:38:52.98
And that picture just like I said,

2375
02:38:52.98 --> 02:38:53.98
Discipline equals freedom.

2376
02:38:53.98 --> 02:38:54.98
There it is.

2377
02:38:54.98 --> 02:38:56.98
There's your picture right there right there on Twitter.

2378
02:38:56.98 --> 02:38:57.98
Yeah, that was cool.

2379
02:38:57.98 --> 02:38:58.98
That, uh, that was cool.

2380
02:38:58.98 --> 02:39:00.98
Somebody actually had to point that out to me.

2381
02:39:00.98 --> 02:39:04.98
When I read it, I was like, damn, they, they're making it very good point.

2382
02:39:04.98 --> 02:39:05.98
Yeah.

2383
02:39:05.98 --> 02:39:09.98
Yeah, but that's like the perfect example in my opinion.

2384
02:39:09.98 --> 02:39:11.98
And that discipline equals freedom.

2385
02:39:11.98 --> 02:39:13.98
It's like within that picture of freedom,

2386
02:39:13.98 --> 02:39:15.98
all you see is discipline all over it.

2387
02:39:15.98 --> 02:39:18.98
I'm going to starting with the 4.30 for in the morning.

2388
02:39:18.98 --> 02:39:21.98
And you know, I tell you, if I would have had more discipline throughout my life,

2389
02:39:21.98 --> 02:39:24.98
I'd be in the even better situation than I am right now.

2390
02:39:24.98 --> 02:39:26.98
Like I look back and say, man, what did I do this for?

2391
02:39:26.98 --> 02:39:27.98
What did I do that for?

2392
02:39:27.98 --> 02:39:32.98
And that's one thing that as, now when people talk to me and ask me questions,

2393
02:39:32.98 --> 02:39:35.98
I'm trying to tell them what mistakes I made.

2394
02:39:35.98 --> 02:39:38.98
Things that I did wrong, things that I did that was stupid,

2395
02:39:38.98 --> 02:39:43.98
so that they can say, oh, okay, because the opportunities are out there.

2396
02:39:43.98 --> 02:39:47.98
You know, the opportunities are out there to make good things happen in your life.

2397
02:39:47.98 --> 02:39:52.98
But you're going to have to, they're not going to, they're not going to show up at your doorstep.

2398
02:39:52.98 --> 02:39:53.98
They're not coming to your doorstep.

2399
02:39:53.98 --> 02:39:55.98
I'm going to tell everybody that right now.

2400
02:39:55.98 --> 02:39:58.98
You have to go out and make them happen.

2401
02:39:58.98 --> 02:40:03.98
You have to go out and take them because they're not going to come knocking on your door.

2402
02:40:03.98 --> 02:40:05.98
The good deal is not coming your door, not happening.

2403
02:40:05.98 --> 02:40:07.98
So crazy how obvious that sounds.

2404
02:40:07.98 --> 02:40:11.98
You know, that, obviously, like you say in that, I'm not going to be like, hey, I never realized that.

2405
02:40:11.98 --> 02:40:13.98
I thought they were going to come to my doorstep.

2406
02:40:13.98 --> 02:40:17.98
But it's almost like most people, I don't say most people,

2407
02:40:17.98 --> 02:40:21.98
but it's almost like people don't really understand that that's true.

2408
02:40:21.98 --> 02:40:27.98
Because you have like people watch this TV, like if you, you know, can't remember lost.

2409
02:40:27.98 --> 02:40:28.98
Remember that?

2410
02:40:28.98 --> 02:40:29.98
I never watched it.

2411
02:40:29.98 --> 02:40:30.98
Okay.

2412
02:40:30.98 --> 02:40:30.98
Yeah.

2413
02:40:30.98 --> 02:40:31.98
I watched her feed up.

2414
02:40:31.98 --> 02:40:33.98
So I remember people were just really into that.

2415
02:40:33.98 --> 02:40:38.98
And they're like talking about loss in the characters because that was a confusing show.

2416
02:40:38.98 --> 02:40:39.98
Is why it's like, use that.

2417
02:40:39.98 --> 02:40:41.98
And they're talking about this.

2418
02:40:41.98 --> 02:40:43.98
Like, they know all the details.

2419
02:40:43.98 --> 02:40:45.98
And they're trying to figure this out.

2420
02:40:45.98 --> 02:40:47.98
And over like seasons upon seasons of loss.

2421
02:40:47.98 --> 02:40:48.98
And they know that.

2422
02:40:48.98 --> 02:40:53.98
Like, but you know what you could have been doing with all that mental energy.

2423
02:40:53.98 --> 02:40:57.98
And the time that it takes to watch all this, you could have been doing a lot.

2424
02:40:57.98 --> 02:41:02.98
And that lost example is just one of many examples of what we all do, I think.

2425
02:41:02.98 --> 02:41:05.98
Well, it's very fitting that it's called lost.

2426
02:41:05.98 --> 02:41:09.98
Because you lost a bunch of time and a bunch of opportunities in your life.

2427
02:41:09.98 --> 02:41:12.98
And let's, I mean, there's things that could be so inspiring.

2428
02:41:12.98 --> 02:41:16.98
I guess some artwork, there are some art forms or some film or movie or show that

2429
02:41:16.98 --> 02:41:18.98
could be so inspiring to you.

2430
02:41:18.98 --> 02:41:24.98
But if it's not inspiring to you, it's not, if it's not forcing you to get out and make something

2431
02:41:24.98 --> 02:41:27.98
more of yourself or create something more that is probably not worth your

2432
02:41:27.98 --> 02:41:29.98
wild, be quite honest with you.

2433
02:41:29.98 --> 02:41:30.98
Right.

2434
02:41:30.98 --> 02:41:34.98
And again, the whole, you know, lost situation.

2435
02:41:34.98 --> 02:41:36.98
I mean, if that, hey, everyone's different.

2436
02:41:36.98 --> 02:41:40.98
I know, but when you're watching TV, which is just, I think, a huge one that

2437
02:41:40.98 --> 02:41:45.98
that people waste their time on, I mean, I can get some inspiration from TV with

2438
02:41:45.98 --> 02:41:47.98
cinema stuff because I'm in video.

2439
02:41:47.98 --> 02:41:51.98
But I think that I would argue that that's not why most people watch TV.

2440
02:41:51.98 --> 02:41:54.98
That's not why they're watching, keeping up with the card actions.

2441
02:41:54.98 --> 02:41:56.98
I'll tell you that.

2442
02:41:56.98 --> 02:41:59.98
So I'm not familiar with this.

2443
02:41:59.98 --> 02:42:01.98
It's a show on TV.

2444
02:42:01.98 --> 02:42:06.98
Nonetheless, people don't act like that that's true.

2445
02:42:06.98 --> 02:42:09.98
That opportunities, not going to just come knocking on your door.

2446
02:42:09.98 --> 02:42:11.98
Well, it goes back to where we're talking about earlier today.

2447
02:42:11.98 --> 02:42:15.98
Are you going to let, are you going to, you only have so much time?

2448
02:42:15.98 --> 02:42:17.98
You only have so much time.

2449
02:42:17.98 --> 02:42:22.98
And if you miss a workout, if you miss a moment with your family, if you,

2450
02:42:22.98 --> 02:42:25.98
whatever you're missing, is it worth it?

2451
02:42:25.98 --> 02:42:26.98
You're letting it go away.

2452
02:42:26.98 --> 02:42:28.98
You only got that day.

2453
02:42:28.98 --> 02:42:30.98
It's only going to go by one time.

2454
02:42:30.98 --> 02:42:33.98
You only got one shot at today.

2455
02:42:33.98 --> 02:42:34.98
What do you can do with it?

2456
02:42:34.98 --> 02:42:35.98
Yeah.

2457
02:42:35.98 --> 02:42:37.98
Do something good.

2458
02:42:37.98 --> 02:42:38.98
Yeah.

2459
02:42:38.98 --> 02:42:41.98
Yeah. It's just, yeah, it's just so interesting.

2460
02:42:41.98 --> 02:42:44.98
How, again, this is like nothing new, you know,

2461
02:42:44.98 --> 02:42:50.98
but I feel like we're, a lot of us act like that that's simply not true.

2462
02:42:50.98 --> 02:42:53.98
Went out weird though.

2463
02:42:53.98 --> 02:42:57.98
Yeah, it is because it's such a big, you know, you have a lot of long time on this earth.

2464
02:42:57.98 --> 02:43:03.98
If you, if you just sit back and go day to day, then waste in a few hours watching a TV program.

2465
02:43:03.98 --> 02:43:06.98
Maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal when you add all those hours up.

2466
02:43:06.98 --> 02:43:09.98
And you subtract them from the actual time that you've got here, man.

2467
02:43:09.98 --> 02:43:10.98
Don't let it go away.

2468
02:43:10.98 --> 02:43:11.98
Let it go away.

2469
02:43:11.98 --> 02:43:14.98
Let's do it.

2470
02:43:14.98 --> 02:43:15.98
Don't do it.

2471
02:43:15.98 --> 02:43:18.98
One of the guys on last was named Mr. Echo, by the way.

2472
02:43:18.98 --> 02:43:19.98
Hmm.

2473
02:43:19.98 --> 02:43:20.98
I think he died though.

2474
02:43:20.98 --> 02:43:21.98
I don't know.

2475
02:43:21.98 --> 02:43:23.98
I wish you wouldn't have given me that information from my head.

2476
02:43:23.98 --> 02:43:25.98
You wasted space in my head.

2477
02:43:25.98 --> 02:43:27.98
I like echo actual.

2478
02:43:27.98 --> 02:43:29.98
It was a little stick with that then.

2479
02:43:29.98 --> 02:43:30.98
All right.

2480
02:43:30.98 --> 02:43:32.98
I think the last one.

2481
02:43:32.98 --> 02:43:34.98
Yeah, I think we got time for one more.

2482
02:43:34.98 --> 02:43:36.98
All right.

2483
02:43:36.98 --> 02:43:37.98
Jucko.

2484
02:43:37.98 --> 02:43:41.98
I lost my little brother who died in a random medical accident.

2485
02:43:41.98 --> 02:43:44.98
He was someone that I always looked after.

2486
02:43:44.98 --> 02:43:52.98
How do you deal with grief and loss of men in your command?

2487
02:43:52.98 --> 02:43:54.98
Someone asked me,

2488
02:43:54.98 --> 02:43:57.98
a similar question that the other day,

2489
02:43:57.98 --> 02:43:59.98
someone along the lines of,

2490
02:43:59.98 --> 02:44:03.98
how going to be good when you lose a loved one.

2491
02:44:03.98 --> 02:44:08.98
And that's definitely a tough question.

2492
02:44:08.98 --> 02:44:10.98
And I almost replied,

2493
02:44:10.98 --> 02:44:14.98
no, it isn't good.

2494
02:44:14.98 --> 02:44:19.98
There's nothing good in death.

2495
02:44:19.98 --> 02:44:32.98
And then I started to remember the people I've lost throughout my life.

2496
02:44:32.98 --> 02:44:36.98
The memories of them, the experiences, the fun.

2497
02:44:36.98 --> 02:44:41.98
There unique personalities.

2498
02:44:41.98 --> 02:44:45.98
And everything they'd given me,

2499
02:44:45.98 --> 02:44:50.98
not only in their life,

2500
02:44:50.98 --> 02:44:55.98
but in their death.

2501
02:44:55.98 --> 02:45:01.98
What their life taught me and what their death taught me.

2502
02:45:01.98 --> 02:45:06.98
The mark,

2503
02:45:06.98 --> 02:45:08.98
the mark they had left on me,

2504
02:45:08.98 --> 02:45:13.98
and I realized,

2505
02:45:13.98 --> 02:45:20.98
I realized that even in death,

2506
02:45:20.98 --> 02:45:23.98
even in death,

2507
02:45:23.98 --> 02:45:29.98
there is good.

2508
02:45:29.98 --> 02:45:35.98
First of all, I was lucky to have that person in my life.

2509
02:45:35.98 --> 02:45:38.98
Even if it was only first or time to short of a time,

2510
02:45:38.98 --> 02:45:41.98
but at least I got that.

2511
02:45:41.98 --> 02:45:44.98
Those unforgettable moments,

2512
02:45:44.98 --> 02:45:47.98
those precious moments.

2513
02:45:47.98 --> 02:45:49.98
At least I got those,

2514
02:45:49.98 --> 02:45:53.98
and I got to experience those times to know

2515
02:45:53.98 --> 02:45:58.98
the beauty of their personality,

2516
02:45:58.98 --> 02:46:05.98
their attitude, their outlook on the world.

2517
02:46:05.98 --> 02:46:09.98
They were all unique and I'm thankful

2518
02:46:09.98 --> 02:46:14.98
for the opportunity that I had to interact with them,

2519
02:46:14.98 --> 02:46:21.98
even if it was just for a short amount of time.

2520
02:46:21.98 --> 02:46:29.98
And now comes death.

2521
02:46:29.98 --> 02:46:31.98
Death is horrible,

2522
02:46:31.98 --> 02:46:32.98
and death is wretched,

2523
02:46:32.98 --> 02:46:33.98
and death is cruel,

2524
02:46:33.98 --> 02:46:38.98
and death isn't fair.

2525
02:46:38.98 --> 02:46:43.98
And I don't know why the best people

2526
02:46:43.98 --> 02:46:51.98
seem to get taken from us first.

2527
02:46:51.98 --> 02:46:59.98
But the fact is death is inescapable.

2528
02:46:59.98 --> 02:47:04.98
There is no way out.

2529
02:47:04.98 --> 02:47:10.98
And death in that death is part of life.

2530
02:47:10.98 --> 02:47:14.98
And like the contrast between the darkness and the light,

2531
02:47:14.98 --> 02:47:20.98
without death, then there is no life.

2532
02:47:20.98 --> 02:47:25.98
And the people that I've lost,

2533
02:47:25.98 --> 02:47:30.98
they taught me that.

2534
02:47:30.98 --> 02:47:35.98
They taught me how precious life is,

2535
02:47:35.98 --> 02:47:39.98
how blessed we are to have every day.

2536
02:47:39.98 --> 02:47:46.98
To learn and to grow and to laugh and to live.

2537
02:47:46.98 --> 02:47:52.98
To live.

2538
02:47:52.98 --> 02:47:57.98
To live every day with purpose and with passion.

2539
02:47:57.98 --> 02:48:03.98
To wake up in the morning and be thankful.

2540
02:48:03.98 --> 02:48:16.98
Thank for that morning, and thankful for the opportunity to go out into the world and live.

2541
02:48:16.98 --> 02:48:18.98
To live for them.

2542
02:48:18.98 --> 02:48:36.98
For those that don't have the opportunity for those that were stolen away by death's cruel hand.

2543
02:48:36.98 --> 02:48:40.98
For them.

2544
02:48:40.98 --> 02:48:43.98
I will live.

2545
02:48:43.98 --> 02:48:53.98
I will cherish their memory and I will live.

2546
02:48:53.98 --> 02:48:57.98
So let's cry no more.

2547
02:48:57.98 --> 02:49:00.98
Let's mourn no more.

2548
02:49:00.98 --> 02:49:04.98
Let's remember.

2549
02:49:04.98 --> 02:49:06.98
But let's not dwell.

2550
02:49:06.98 --> 02:49:10.98
Instead.

2551
02:49:10.98 --> 02:49:23.98
Let's laugh and let's love and let's embrace and cherish everything that life is and every opportunity it gives us.

2552
02:49:23.98 --> 02:49:33.98
Live.

2553
02:49:33.98 --> 02:49:40.98
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2554
02:49:40.98 --> 02:49:53.98
Remembering the ones we have lost by embracing the ones we still have.

2555
02:49:53.98 --> 02:49:56.98
So, Devon out there.

2556
02:49:56.98 --> 02:50:02.98
Thank you for embracing us and listening to what we have to say and supporting what we are doing.

2557

2558
02:50:07.98 --> 02:50:11.98

2561
02:50:18.98 --> 02:50:19.98
Sublimitation.

2562
02:50:19.98 --> 02:50:20.98
The good kind.

2563
02:50:20.98 --> 02:50:23.98
We haven't really talked that much about it recently.

2564
02:50:23.98 --> 02:50:26.98
But I mean, any kind of depth.

2565
02:50:26.98 --> 02:50:36.98
That's the best way to support yourself.

2566
02:50:36.98 --> 02:50:41.98
And that's the way to support yourself.

2567
02:50:41.98 --> 02:50:46.98
And that's the way to support yourself.

2568
02:50:46.98 --> 02:50:57.98
And you want to listen to them rather than physically read them.

You know, good one.

2578
02:51:29.98 --> 02:51:31.98
Speaking of good ones.

2579
02:51:31.98 --> 02:51:33.98

Get two or a coffee mug or whatever.

2583
02:51:40.98 --> 02:51:46.98
Yeah, or if you're in the mood to donate, which some people have been doing, which is crazy.

2584
02:51:46.98 --> 02:51:49.98
Yet very, I think we're very grateful for that one.

2585
02:51:49.98 --> 02:51:50.98
Right?

2586
02:51:50.98 --> 02:51:51.98
Don't eat something.

2587
02:51:51.98 --> 02:51:52.98
$4.34.

2588
02:51:52.98 --> 02:51:54.98
Or whatever.

2589
02:51:54.98 --> 02:51:56.98

Echo Charles is at Echo Charles and I am at

2593
02:52:09.98 --> 02:52:12.98
Jockel Willink.

2594
02:52:12.98 --> 02:52:17.98
We are also on Facebook and on Instagram.

2595
02:52:17.98 --> 02:52:21.98
And you know, this has been a pretty cool experience.

2596
02:52:21.98 --> 02:52:26.98
So far, in last week, this little podcast,

2597
02:52:26.98 --> 02:52:31.98
broken to the top 20 on iTunes, which was pretty cool of all podcasts.

2598
02:52:31.98 --> 02:52:33.98
And that's kind of crazy to see.

2599
02:52:33.98 --> 02:52:37.98
And it's because of you.

2600
02:52:37.98 --> 02:52:44.98
Because of you out there listening, reviewing, telling people to check it out.

2601
02:52:44.98 --> 02:52:46.98
Spread in the word.

2602
02:52:46.98 --> 02:52:48.98
It's you.

2603
02:52:48.98 --> 02:52:51.98
You are responsible for all this.

2604
02:52:51.98 --> 02:52:55.98
Your questions, your support.

2605
02:52:55.98 --> 02:53:02.98
So thank you for joining us in this.

2606
02:53:02.98 --> 02:53:06.98
This crazy world we're living in for choosing to fight

2607
02:53:06.98 --> 02:53:10.98
instead of surrender for choosing to bring light into the world

2608
02:53:10.98 --> 02:53:19.98
and set a darkness for choosing to be stronger and set a weaker for choosing to get better every day for choosing to live.

2609
02:53:19.98 --> 02:53:30.98
Every day by choosing to get up and get after it.

2610
02:53:30.98 --> 02:53:37.98
And so until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.

2611
02:53:37.98 --> 02:54:04.98
Out.
