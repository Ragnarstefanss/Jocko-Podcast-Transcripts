uh and again um I'm proud of that working group proud of Pete and Stan uh and uh the other guys a grin because I didn't like I said I didn't want to start going down his road if somebody was gonna you know throw out you know dozens of man years of work and planning to uh uh to toss it out so that was uh that and in combination with uh the uh the the SWICK NEC uh work the the two things that uh that I figured were probably the uh you know best accomplishments that uh uh that I uh that I ever had let me have one more thing you talked earlier about uh working with the uh uh the physical therapists and so on uh you need to uh to go back and uh thank uh uh I believe it was Pete Tony's uh who who started that uh you know bring it in those uh those physical therapists uh to work with the uh with the uh with the with the team guys uh Uh, um uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh, uh. Uh, I missed a particular, uh, the operation, but, uh, grant, uh, grant Telfer squad had a, uh, had a phenomenal app, uh, you know, based on some intelligence that we generated, uh, and again, uh, you know, jackshults, uh, uh, uh, uh, would, uh, would go off, uh, you know, uh, checking with, uh, the PRUs, the, uh, the advisors, and, you know, looking for, you know, bits and pieces of intelligence, and, uh, one of the, uh, uh, one of the clues that they came up with was a, uh, a weapon storage facility, uh, not too far from, uh, from where Salt Anchor was located down there in the, uh, Nam Can Province. So, as their son goes through training, uh, I was, you know, particularly careful to make sure that, uh, that I did not single, uh, you know, him out, but, uh, I was, it was also, uh, you know, attentive to the fact that, you know, sometimes, uh, the son of a, we call him legacy is going through training, uh, just like they did and what was that, uh, was that movie, uh, uh, animal house, uh, you know, legacies, uh, but, uh, we, we wanted to make sure that, uh, you know, somebody's father had been, uh, jackass of the week to one of the, uh, the instructors, that that didn't carry over and take his sons attempt to get through training. Uh, we, uh, you know, and, uh, unfortunately, uh, there was not much of a debrief, uh, you know, we were all there, and, uh, we all there have been two, I think, except Marcus, Marcus said, uh, Marcus went, well, I don't know what his, uh, his, uh, his, his, he's back process was, but, uh, the rest of us were there, and, uh, and, uh, been two, he third, uh, field surgical hospital, uh, together for a few days, but then, then we went different directions, uh, in the, uh, in the process, uh, uh, Jim Roland went one, one place I came back to San Diego. Anyway, uh, uh, the guys stood on me, uh, from the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it's all got punched for my feet and then the second and third rounds, you know, you start with one guy and what's called the bottom position and the other guy, his arms around the, around the rest of the, the top position. Uh, and sometimes, if you, if you, if you didn't have something to work with, uh, you know, it might be every, every, every third day, might be every fourth day, uh, but, uh, oh boy, uh, we had a, uh, we had a, uh, a little sign hanging on the, uh, on the, uh, on the, uh, on the outside of the Hootch, and I actually, uh, that, that, that, you know, where you draw the little lines and then a slash to a, you know, five, uh, those were the, uh, those were the, that was a, uh, telly, they, what we, of the, of the known K. I, uh, I, I really don't remember the, uh, the total number of options we did in that, uh, in that six months. yes all right here we go we still lifting weights or what well given the uh seven plus decades I've been on the face of the earth uh the uh you know you know a few and uh a few and far between I've uh I've actually uh just in the last five or six weeks uh started to uh to go back in the gym uh but uh it's something I'll never stop uh and and the reason for it is you know at uh it's 74 years of age I don't have to hire somebody to cut my lawn I can still go out there I can do it uh and I've got I've got my people working in trailers in trailers and uh long story short because it's the way things work we got that money we got an accelerated military construction program that you know clearly wasn't done by the time I uh I left command but that was that became one of the top priorities for the so-com uh so-com milk on budget to uh to get us some buildings and I'll go one step further uh you know this afternoon I'm getting a chance to go down and uh and uh and uh and view uh uh the new uh new facilities for uh for seal team one that whole Naval Special Warfare complex down there is billions of dollars more importantly that says that that billion dollar figure was high enough in the priority list to get funded that says that so-com and the United States Navy and the Department of Defense recognized the commitment required to retain the capability that Naval Special Warfare provides to our military readiness they understand that and they're funding it it's not just a bunch of new buildings it says so much more than that and I will also say that at one point in time when I was looking for the uh for the next uh you know command uh well the force master chief for naval special warfare it came down to Kelly and a uh and and tried and winner uh so those are the last two guys standing uh but uh he was a he was quite a guy so establishment of the uh uh the SWIC uh SWIC community was something that was uh uh just uh just outstanding and it's now it's a rate and everything and guys going that's the career they can go and they have their whole career and special special boat team and one of the no we were still in our if you will early years with special operations command we were still in our early years of somewhat of a divorce from the Navy if you will because you know my I had had two two people I reported to you know one was a joint service commander army Navy Air Force or Marine down there in Tampa and the other was a code up on the on the op-nav staff you know ultimately of course to the C&O but the the money was there's there's something called a golden roll he what's got the gold rules and the the money at that time was from socom and that's where you know the vast majority of my my attention went but going back to the to the opportunities there were so many things so many things going on in the in the world and and specifically within our community there is a captain by the name of Todd Visi he was not a captain at the time but Todd was a station down at Navy Military Personnel Command uh I believe that was after they had uh it was after they had uh shifted down to uh the Memphis and what Todd did was he carried the water for our efforts to create the SWIC community you know when I uh when I took over a CO special boat unit 13 we had fleet sailors coming to drive these small boats the engines the uh you know quote main propulsion engines of a uh uh 65 foot Mark III patrol boat where a Detroit V Detroit diesel 8B 713 and uh I knew I knew right then it was going to be uh you know quite a quite a deal uh because of the work I was doing with uh essay I see I had the opportunity to sit in on a briefing that was uh given by the chief and naval operations at the time and uh he had been with the president just a few days before and as he recounted his uh experience with the uh with the president you could have heard a pin drop in the room uh given the uh the commitment uh and the uh will to fix that We had, uh, we had deployed in, uh, in August of 70, and, uh, we were, you know, scheduled to come back to, uh, the, uh, beginning of February, 71, and, uh, and, uh, and my squad had, uh, you know, started, uh, you know, clean in the gear and prepare and gear to pack it up and, uh, and send it home. Uh, we did things like, uh, going out in, uh, sand pans, but rolling a night looking for the, uh, for the V.C. tax collectors, uh, you're trying to hit up the, uh, the locals, uh, we'd sit on, uh, sit on, uh, you know, reverse side ambushes, uh, you know, looking for these guys. but well look we we got a bunch of stories out of you today like I said I know you're gonna go um you got any closing thoughts you want to say uh I had a great 30 years a lot of good guys and I'll tell you one one important closing thought uh when I took over in 96 we were still deploying seal patterns the same way I walked out the door in 1970 26 years a lot of things have changed in those 26 years uh Captain Pete Tony's in Stan Demit uh both guys who'd been group commanders on the east coast had come in and had uh pitch day uh uh uh recommended change of how to do business uh and we were calling it the squadron deployment If you look at Vietnam on a map, there's, it's kind of like a little tail kind of like the, uh, the keys and, uh, in Florida, well, there's a little tail down there and, uh, the very bottom part of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, of Vietnam and we were on the, uh, we're on some called the Coulon River down there. And, uh, I was, you know, pretty much determined that I was going to go to a place called Portland State, uh, Portland had, uh, an, uh, an excellent, uh, you know, PT program, uh, you know, for, uh, teaching and, uh, they, uh, they also had a pretty good wrestling team at the time. Uh, and, uh, you know, one of them was a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a highly decorated, uh, seal chief by the name of, uh, Tommy Hatchett. but we had the uh we had the core of uh of what we were looking at we were already already looking at uh you know different uh team deployments and how we were gonna change that all so we would have one team uh with uh boat guys intelligent support we just support that kind of thing uh deploying forward and uh as I as I stop and and look today it looks a whole lot different than uh than what what walked out the door finally under Eric Olson A name was John Sanrico, uh, you know, stronger than a law allowed, uh, but, uh, with, with a name like, Sanrico, his nickname was dizzy, uh, but that John, uh, John could, uh, could quote only bench press about three and a quarter, three, thirty five and he was always complaining that listen, this is 198 pounder, you know, five foot eight, uh, 198 pounder, played full back, uh, and he's benching 335 pounds, you know, I mean, that's something to write home about. Oh, absolutely, uh, the SPI program, uh, when I went through it was, uh, run by, uh, guys like, uh, Mesh Chief, Own Yui, uh, and, uh, you know, Uncle Own, uh, Mesh Chief Own Yui was a, uh, was a fantastic individual. so you get a uh an engine from the fleet who's never seen your engine uh you get a gunners made from his fleet who's looking for the five inch gun uh you get a uh you get a uh communications or electronic technician who's looking for uh you know CIC it ain't there uh and old by the way uh you need to learn about the M60 the prick 77 uh you you name it that they've never seen before in their life so we'd get these guys for two or three years they learn a lot about names special warfare them boom One, uh, because nobody was killed, uh, with that number of bad guys, uh, and without the, uh, the, the, the flying and dedication of, uh, how three, uh, Carl Nelson in particular and, uh, and his, uh, you know, his door gunners, uh, I'm not here to have the conversation. I I talked to as many folks as I could on each coast and uh I remember you know saying the focus and guys you know this is this is hard for me because so much my time is going to be directed upward you know whether it's you know budget personnel matters that uh that I'm going to have to work with so common the uh and in the navy uh when I walked in to command at uh at Naval Special Warfare there was a relatively new building that didn't come close to accommodating the staff at Naval Special Warfare Command when I walked in six eight ten maybe use twenty trailers surrounding the building you know yeah do you got a gym at your house uh I've got a few hundred pounds so here you go when I went down to El Salvador I went on a company for a year and uh with that I was able to send uh uh a thousand pounds or 1100 pounds of uh a personal gear 700 pounds of weightlifting equipment I had I had squat racks of bench and at least 500 pounds of uh pounds of weights in my own room in my own uh in my own building when I uh there was a the the guy We had a, uh, we had a guy on the, uh, uh, on the, uh, on the football team, uh, name is Ray played, uh, and, uh, so I'm another, you know, 50 year reunion a few years ago and, uh, he's doing well. So, I get to Villanova and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what was back up a little bit more to, you know, staying in, uh, in school. I'm now the, uh, the skipper of, of butts and, uh, uh, Ray is, uh, is the admiral in charge of, uh, uh, Naval Special Warfare Command and, uh, Ray and his wife Kathy are living across the street on the amphib base and, uh, Ray's son is going through seal training. So, uh, and it was only X number of weeks, uh, you know, a couple of months, uh, because we had to, you know, finish up, uh, we're enough time to give, give guys a, uh, a week or 10 days off before, uh, deployin, just to, you know, take care of business. And the three star, Davy type, who was in charge of, of, of, you know, midies for, you know, navy, midies for, he, I didn't realize it, but he was in the talk the whole time, you know, listening, you know, I'm sure the, the was out was based in Bahrain, we're out there in the middle of the Persian Gulf, and the, the, the, the album was there, you just listen and you know, when I, when I called it off, when I saw what it was, you know, and when in, so I came, I came, a sure, you know, week 10 days later in the, you know, six, you know, up so caused me over and he says, good job, but, you know, we had, we had American lives on the line, we had international lives on the line, could have been a mining operation, I just did not know, and I was not sure that this was a minor, a mining vessel, so I said, nope, what I doing at, what were your major lessons learned, what was a good takeaway from being the mining officer tilting one? and I are supporting a uh a wildlife museum in uh in Virginia Beach and uh other than that where I were pretty much uh pretty much retired but uh anybody wants to uh an old far within a pinion uh you know give me a call
