00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 228 with Eccle Charles and me, Jockel Willing.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening, Eccle.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And also joining us tonight, once again, is Dave Burke.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening, Dave.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Good evening.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So we only got through the first two sections of the Marine Corps,

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Doctional Learning Publication.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Last time, we're the Doctional Publication Learning.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Last time.

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So we're going to finish it up today.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I must say that since we covered that, since I read this for the first time,

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I've been trying to pay attention to things from a learning perspective.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Learning things.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I've actually talked to both of you about squeezing your brains.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And we mentioned it on the last podcast, and we kind of bruised through it.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Like, I think I just said, oh, yeah, I've been talking to you guys about squeezing your brains.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Kind of breeze through it.

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Didn't really talk about what that actually means.

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So I wanted to, I wanted to kind of do a little discussion or dive into,

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What does that mean?

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What does it mean to squeeze your brain?

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because it's important.

24
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It is so important to put pressure.

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The pressure, put the pressure on your brain on your thoughts on how you're thinking

26
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because that pressure creates heat and pressure in your mind,

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
therefore creates energy.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It creates ideas.

29
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And that is how we learn.

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That is how we get smarter.

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That is how we get better from that pressure.

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And it ties back into something from the discipline of course freedom field manual,

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which is question everything.

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Right?

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Question everything.

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
No matter where it's coming from, question your own ideas,

37
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
question other people's ideas, you got to have that mindset,

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that kind of rebellious mindset where you're always going to push back against things.

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I'm not talking about just being a contrary and where Dave comes up with an idea and I say,

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
well, what about this?

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm not talking about that.

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But I am talking about a subconscious dialogue that's happening,

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
where that's, I would say, my original form of applying pressure to my mind

44
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
was sitting there saying, is there a better way to do that?

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Is there, I'm not saying I'm going to confront you,

46
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but I'm thinking myself, is there a better way to do that?

47
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Am I wrong about it?

48
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If I come up with it, am I wrong about this idea?

49
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Is the tradition wrong?

50
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Is the way, you know, the complaint about,

51
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
oh, this is how we all do it.

52
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And I'm constantly saying, well, just because we do it that way,

53
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is that tradition wrong?

54
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Is that standard wrong?

55
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And in order to answer those questions, in order to answer those questions,

56
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
it puts pressure on your brain, it puts pressure on your mind.

57
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because oftentimes the ideas that you're questioning,

58
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the ideas that you're questioning the standards that you're questioning,

59
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the tradition that you're questioning are things that have been around for a while.

60
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You've survived some level of pressure.

61
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So to think that you're going to come up with some new way is,

62
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it's a little bit ridiculous, but at the same time,

63
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
you have to do it.

64
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You have to do it too, free your mind,

65
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
which I used to post that on a pretty regular basis for you,

66
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but in order to free your mind,

67
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you actually have to add weight,

68
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
you have to put a force on top of your mind and your ideas in order to,

69
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in order to squeeze out results in order to free it.

70
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And when you do that, then that's when you improve.

71
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I'm not talking about the kind of,

72
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
hey, you know, all the constant self-improvement, right?

73
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm not talking about, I'm actually getting better.

74
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm talking about actual answers to real answers to questions.

75
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Actually, we'll improve understanding of the world.

76
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Improved understanding of the world.

77
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I've been talking about this day.

78
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And this is just kind of happening.

79
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I think I sense a light switch,

80
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
flipper, whatever you want to call it.

81
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
EF Online, you were coming up with sort of the discussion point for the day.

82
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And so EF Online is, we got a bunch of people coming on.

83
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
They're interacting with us. It's a Zoom meeting,

84
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
which I think the whole world is now familiar with.

85
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Zoom meeting. So we've expanded our online presence and we're really putting a lot of time and effort behind EF Online.

86
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And so we've been running these three times a week online community,

87
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
brigade of people.

88
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And so you were, you were kind of leading the discussion on this particular one.

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I think the question that spurned you to squeeze your brain a little bit was,

90
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
how do you adapt to a changing world?

91
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And you went through this story about when you were in the Marine Corps,

92
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and when you were a top gun instructor,

93
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and what the Marine Corps was doing and what top gun was doing was preparing,

94
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
being prepared to fight the Meg 29, the Meg 29 full-groom,

95
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
which is an aircraft that is correct me from wrong.

96
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The full-groom is not as good as our aircraft.

97
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And not as good as an F-18.

98
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah, that's right. F-14?

99
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Probably better than the F-14.

100
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So that's better than the F-14, but not as good as an F-18.

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yep.

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And that's what you, when you went to top gun as a student,

103
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that's what they were telling you, okay, this is what you need to be prepared to fight.

104
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Yeah, the Meg 29, that's right.

105
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
An aircraft that's not quite as good as yours.

106
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Not quite as good as your F-18.

107
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's what they were telling you.

108
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So then you leave, and I get this right, you leave top gun school.

109
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And when you come back now to be the instructor, the senior instructor, eventually,

110
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
the Russians had a new aircraft.

111
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That was the SU-27 Flanker, which actually, I was excited to know,

113
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that happens to be my favorite bird.

114
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I like, have you ever seen that bird?

115
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
No.

116
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It looks like a cobra that's getting ready to strike.

117
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's just an awesome look in aircraft.

118
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And it was now this aircraft is better than an F-18.

119
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Yeah.

120
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Were you in for the F-14s at all?

121
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes.

122
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So I-

123
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So I-

124
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They phase out F-14s.

125
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So the last F-14 class at Top Gun was probably 2004,

126
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
as when we phased him out.

127
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They probably flew a little bit in the fleet,

128
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but I was there as an instructor during the last Tomcat class.

129
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

130
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
In my mind, the F-the Tomcat has always been the muscle car.

131
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
The muscle car of the fighter jets.

132
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Yeah, it's like an iconic muscle machine.

133
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
For tuning, I've got a lot of power.

134
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Yep.

135
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I can go fast.

136
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Yep.

137
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'm not going to corner a great, right?

138
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Yeah, it's a more of a brute force machine,

139
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
really fast, really cool airplane,

140
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
but a little bit dated by the time I was there at Top Gun.

141
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So you're used to F-18.

142
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Now the SU-27 is now a real thing.

143
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yeah.

144
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And you come back as an instructor.

145
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The people, the thing that you all were preparing to fight

146
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
was still the, the make 29.

147
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And you, I guess, looked at this and said,

148
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a not a good plan.

149
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
There's something better.

150
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We should be prepared to fight the worst case scenario,

151
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
which for us is the SU-27.

152
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah.

153
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That's right.

154
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And it wasn't even just the worst case scenario.

155
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It was just the reality that this thing was being proliferated.

156
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So the Russians weren't just building it.

157
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
They were selling it.

158
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So it was going other places too.

159
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So you could have, well, we're not going to go to war with the Russians.

160
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Like, okay, maybe not.

161
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Maybe we're not going to go to the war with the Russians.

162
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But this airplane is going to find itself in places

163
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that we wouldn't even know.

164
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And if we showed up to meet that thing and we were unprepared,

165
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
we're going to get rolled.

166
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And that was a big deal.

167
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We're going to get rolled.

168
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So you saw this new world, basically.

169
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And you adapted to the new threat.

170
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You adapted to this new reality.

171
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And that was the lesson that you were trying to share on the F-Online,

172
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
which was, hey, when you get a new reality,

173
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
which, by the way, this is all in reference to COVID-19,

174
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
what's the new reality?

175
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And we've got every different spectrum of business on there.

176
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So it means different things to different people.

177
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And the bottom line is the lesson was you get ahead of the new reality.

178
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You don't wait for it.

179
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You get ahead of it.

180
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And when we got off the call or whatever,

181
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and I talked to you about it.

182
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I said, something like, hey, that was a,

183
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that was a solid lesson.

184
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Like, did you squeeze your brain to get that out?

185
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And you said something like, yeah, I did.

186
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I squeezed my brain.

187
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I thought about, you know, what is this situation?

188
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And how can I explain it better?

189
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And when you do that, you understand better.

190
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Right? Like, you Dave Burke, when you, when you,

191
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
when you put that threat out there and you, you,

192
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
you, you carried us through that story.

193
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
You understood things better.

194
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And that's why when I get all excited about understanding the world in a better way,

195
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that's an example of how, even you,

196
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
this is something that you know, it's something that you actually did as a human being.

197
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And yet until you recognize it from that other perspective until you scream,

198
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you squeeze your brain and pressure on your brain,

199
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you don't get the benefit of it.

200
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The real benefit, the next level of benefit.

201
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And then when you start to tie these threads to other things,

202
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
other things that don't always, always appear to be related like COVID-19

203
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and make 29s, but they are related, then you win.

204
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So every time you put pressure on your mind, you force yourself to think better and get better.

205
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And this happened to me the other day again.

206
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And it happens to me, I'll be honest with you, it actually happens to me a decent amount.

207
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Because I'm always, again, I'm always kind of put that pressure on there.

208
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm always squeezing it.

209
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And it was another EF online scenario.

210
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And what's good about EF online is look when people send me a question over social media.

211
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's cool.

212
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And we try to answer the question, but you can't get any context around it.

213
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
On EF online, you're getting the context, the person there.

214
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
In this case, in particular, this is a guy named Ben.

215
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And he was talking about being on the path.

216
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And at the time, it was something along these lines.

217
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
He's been furloughed.

218
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
He's not in charge of anyone right now.

219
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
He's stuck at home.

220
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It'd be a good time to get in shape.

221
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But he's having trouble doing it.

222
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Right?

223
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So I went down the path of, again, because the way this story was unfolding from him,

224
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
he's normally at work.

225
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
He's normally in charge of people.

226
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So we're talking about it from a leadership perspective.

227
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I said something like, hey, you are not in charge of anyone else right now.

228
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But you're your own CEO, which is something we hear all the time, right?

229
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You're your own CEO, you're your own Supreme Commander.

230
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
You're your own general.

231
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And he got it.

232
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And he said, thanks.

233
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And that was cool.

234
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I thought I kept thinking about it.

235
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Because it was some like thing in my brain where it makes sense.

236
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But it's not that easy.

237
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It's actually not that easy.

238
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Because here's the deal.

239
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You are your own general of your life.

240
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You're going to come up with a plan.

241
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You're going to make decisions.

242
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
You're going to give orders, right?

243
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
That's what's going to happen.

244
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Here's the part that I was kind of missing.

245
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Is that yes, you're your own general.

246
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You're your own commander on the battlefield.

247
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But you are also the soldiers.

248
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
You are also the troops.

249
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You are.

250
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And we actually know, factually, that troops don't just blindly follow orders.

251
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That doesn't happen.

252
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We, hey, look, we would like that to be happening.

253
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Right?

254
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Well, let me rephrase that.

255
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
That's the scenario that people think would be totally ideal.

256
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
That I borrow orders and everyone listens to me.

257
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
But we know we know that that doesn't work.

258
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It doesn't work in a military.

259
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It doesn't work in business.

260
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It doesn't work in a military.

261
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It doesn't work in business.

262
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It doesn't work with your kids.

263
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It doesn't work.

264
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
You have to get people to a certain point.

265
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
They have to be trained.

266
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They have to be educated.

267
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They have to be disciplined.

268
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They have to know why they're doing what they're doing.

269
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And if you don't explain these things to them, then they're not going to do what they

270
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
supposed to do.

271
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Right?

272
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
They're not going to do what they're supposed to do.

273
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
If you, if you don't build that relationship,

274
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
if you don't have that unifying mission, it's not going to work.

275
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So, if you're too close to your feelings, all kinds of parallels.

276
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
If you're too close to your feelings, right?

277
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
If you're reacting to your feelings, like, oh, I really don't feel like doing this.

278
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Then your feelings are going to start to drive the way you act.

279
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And we don't necessarily want that all the time.

280
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Just like a leader.

281
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
If a leader is too close to his troops and the troops are pushing back,

282
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
he's so, we don't want to do that.

283
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Okay, you guys don't feel, okay, you see what I'm saying?

284
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
It's like a perfect parallel.

285
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
At the same time, if you just bark orders at your troops,

286
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and they don't know why they're doing what they're doing,

287
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
then they're not going to commit to doing it in any meaningful way.

288
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And just like troops, if you're a grunt and I bark orders at you, you go, yep, yes sir, you go do it.

289
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I do that to you the next day, you go do it.

290
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I do that to you the next day, all of a sudden you're not, you're lagging.

291
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I do that to you for a month, you're not invested anymore.

292
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Same thing, so when you say to yourself, I'm just going to get up,

293
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I'm going to get up and do it.

294
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
That's cool.

295
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
In my work for a day, it might work for two days, it might work for three days.

296
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And sometimes I absolutely use that, use that type of leadership with myself,

297
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
where I'm, you know, hey, look, there's no time to debate right now.

298
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You need to get up and go to your workout.

299
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
But if you try and make that the way that the only way that you're leading yourself,

300
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
functionally over time, it's going to fall short.

301
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
If you push your troops too hard, they're going to break.

302
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Right, you can actually push yourself so hard that you break.

303
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
You can over-trained.

304
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
If you're too easy on your troops, you can then soft.

305
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Same thing with what the way you happens with yourself.

306
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
The better you try.

307
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
This is an important one.

308
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The better you train your troops, the better they respond.

309
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So once my troops are used to, hey, this is how I do it.

310
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This is why I do it.

311
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Once they're used to that, they respond better.

312
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They know what it is I want from them.

313
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
They want to give me that response, just like when you follow a routine every day.

314
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And you know what you're supposed to do.

315
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And you're troop, your mental soldiers know what they're supposed to do.

316
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
They start to respond better.

317
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
When you realize when your mental troops know that, hey,

318
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
dog was gonna work out.

319
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It's gonna happen.

320
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And we could either stand around and procrastinate

321
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
or we could just suck it up and go get it done.

322
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
They go, can I want, hey, this is going that way.

323
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So the better you train your mental troops,

324
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the better you're going to get a response from them.

325
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
The better the better you take care of your mental troops.

326
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The more they're going to take care of you.

327
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
As long as you don't cough them as long as you don't spoil them

328
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
because once again, they're going to be soft and they're going to be worthless.

329
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So you are leading yourself.

330
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
That's the thing.

331
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You are leading yourself.

332
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
You are in charge, but you are also the troops that have to do the work.

333
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And if you understand it that way, then you can actually start to pay attention

334
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
between the relationship that you have with you as the leader and you as the troops.

335
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And the connection between where you are and where it is you want to go.

336
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Because the general might want to secure a beachhead.

337
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But that's meaningless without the troops taking action and making it happen.

338
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So the ideas and plans of the generals have to be executed by the chain of command.

339
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And they might do it out of fear for a minute, but they're not going to do it for a long period of time.

340
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
They will do it out of honor.

341
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
They will do it out of pride.

342
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
They will do it if they understand the long term goal.

343
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
They will do it if the goal of the general is aligned with the goals of the troops.

344
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
If they're not aligned, we're not going to get what we want.

345
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.000
So whether you're talking about the chain of command inside your own head or the chain of command in the military,

346
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
the chain of command of business, leadership is leadership.

347
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And we cannot lead if we don't earn.

348
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000
We can't learn if we don't put pressure on our minds to make them figure things out.

349
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Learning.

350
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And with that, let's go back to the book.

351
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
You've ever seen the movie Goodfellis?

352
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Yes.

353
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So there's this scene where Joe Pashy, I think, his girl just came from the air.

354
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
He just came from the airport, smuggled some diamonds in her hair.

355
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So it's a long, and she's like, okay, let's get these diamonds out and she's doing this.

356
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
They're all falling out and she's like, yep, that's it.

357
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And they're like, hey, you sure you don't got any but they're got to be more in there.

358
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
There has to be.

359
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
She's like, this is it.

360
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So she's like, oh, there's no.

361
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And he essentially squeezes her little hair, do shuffles him in a few more diamonds come out.

362
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
All right.

363
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So that's the first.

364
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
It's the same thing.

365
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You do a little bit of a breath and remember how we were talking about this before, where you're

366
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
essentially when you told me about the brain squeeze was essentially a rebuttal to the idea that,

367
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
if it's just not coming to me, hey, it's not it's time, you know, it'll come in time or not at all.

368
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Right.

369
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Like it then it's not meant to be almost kind of thing, right?

370
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
That was your rebuttal because you thought that that's essentially what I was saying.

371
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I wasn't saying that, but that's what you thought I was saying.

372
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And that makes sense, especially when you go back, not especially, but when you go back to the good fellow

373
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
is the analogy where, you know, in her mind, yeah, hey, that's it.

374
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
That's all we got.

375
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
You know, what am I going to do?

376
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Shave my head?

377
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
No.

378
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Right.

379
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
That's all I got.

380
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You know, and Joe Bessier was like, oh man, we're going to do that little brain squeeze.

381
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
We're going to get a few more diamonds.

382
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
How do you?

383
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
That's a, that's a, that's sensible.

384
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You know, sir.

385
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
You get one credit for today.

386
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I think I understood.

387
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I think I understand.

388
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And now black already.

389
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Yeah.

390
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Well, you talked to me about that.

391
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I figured it was that you're talking about making videos, which is your creative pursuit on the earth.

392
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Sure.

393
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Wonderful.

394
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And you were telling me that sometimes, you know, this, this idea is a little bit of an idea, whatever,

395
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and then it fades and you forget about it or you don't execute on it.

396
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And I was telling you that, in fact, the little ideas just aren't going to grow to be,

397
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
outstanding without some pressure on them.

398
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
That put them a little squeeze on.

399
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
You're not going to get those diamonds out.

400
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000
You know, I was going to hang out and, you know, I guess maybe part of me when I'm kind of thinking back on that whole scenario or a scenario scenario's like it.

401
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Or I'm kind of like, or I was with the philosophy of like, well, hey, look, if there's some diamonds in there,

402
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
hey, they're gone.

403
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I come out, you know, let's let them come out naturally so they can kind of, you know, through their own

404
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
evolution kind of manifest themselves kind of thing, you know, and I think after thinking about it,

405
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
it's like, man, I don't know if that's the best way.

406
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I'm reviewing my entire life right now in my head, all of it.

407
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
As fast as I can, and I'm going to say that I think if I didn't put pressure on my head,

408
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I would be zero.

409
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I would be zero.

410
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
My score would be zero.

411
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
There would be zero diamonds on the table.

412
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Zero.

413
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Not that I'm saying I got diamonds on the table, but at least there's some pieces of coal.

414
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
That's come out and they can, they can whatever we can scratch some black marks on a, on a page or whatever, like at least it's something.

415
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
It's bet.

416
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
It's not nothing.

417
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
It's nothing.

418
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Right.

419
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
So we're going to have to do it.

420
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
But this perspective of learning and one of the, one of the things that I realized I never thought about before,

421
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
when they talk about learning, as we covered on the last podcast, they're talking about,

422
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
if I see the enemy do something, that was effective, I learned.

423
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I never thought about learning from that perspective before in my life.

424
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So this is a new development.

425
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
But now I just took that idea and started thinking about how,

426
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
there's a lot of things I've learned along the way.

427
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And I was trying to pull the thread and see what the source of that was.

428
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And a lot of it boiled back down to like asking questions of everything that I see.

429
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And again, I'm not talking about being a contrarian because,

430
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Contrarians, they have their time in place and I'm sure sometimes I might be a little bit,

431
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
actually I don't actually don't think that.

432
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I don't think I'm a contrarian.

433
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I think I will, if there's an idea that is contrary to what someone is saying,

434
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
and I would like to explore whether it's right or not, I will bring it up all day long.

435
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
But I won't bring up an idea just to kind of be different.

436
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
For the sake of doing it.

437
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I've worked for people like that.

438
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Yeah, it's like part of their personality.

439
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
I work from one in particular and it was just super annoying.

440
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
You know, and I just have to be like,

441
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
especially because he was a senior guy.

442
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
And so his little contrarian statements would,

443
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
would send people in directions that I wish we were not going,

444
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
because I knew that they were not going to prove.

445
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
They weren't going to provide any fruit on the other side.

446
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Definitely no diamonds were going on.

447
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
The brain squeeze also,

448
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
it does like secondary stuff too,

449
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
where let's say you're trying to squeeze your brain.

450
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I need this idea to kind of fulfill this last element of this comprehensive idea that I want to put out.

451
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I need this one little element and I'm squeezing my brain.

452
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
No diamonds yet, but other stuff is coming out.

453
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Maybe some collateral.

454
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Maybe some, you know, maybe a ruby over here.

455
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Or what do you call those blue ones, the sapphire, whatever.

456
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Maybe over there.

457
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I don't need that right now, but that came out.

458
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Maybe I'll save that one for later.

459
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Maybe maybe those will be part of a future idea.

460
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
So boom, you got all these jewels essentially.

461
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And then finally, let's say the diamond doesn't come out.

462
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Let's say it straight up doesn't come out.

463
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You got all those rubies and stuff.

464
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
If you didn't do that brain squeeze,

465
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
you can say I have no diamond anyway without those other jewels, you seem to say.

466
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Yeah, I'm taking a subconscious kind of note to myself,

467
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:29.000
or I'm putting myself on subconscious notice because like you and I are sitting here just throwing around that we're just producing diamonds.

468
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And that's so just not true, but it's a metaphor.

469
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yes, producing an idea which may or may not have value, but the thing is it doesn't exist unless you put some pressure on your on your mind.

470
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And it's so just like working out, right?

471
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
You're not going to get stronger if you don't put some pressure on you.

472
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
You're not going to get better to just who unless you get some pressure put on you.

473
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Doesn't happen.

474
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
So you have to put pressure on your mind.

475
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
The thing is you can so easily go through life right now without putting any pressure on your mind.

476
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
You can go through life right now.

477
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And I guess when I'm talking about you can be a 36 year old, a 42 year old, a 19 year old and put no pressure on your brain and just resort to the modules of knowledge that you have.

478
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And if they don't fit that well, it's cool just just you know put some spackle over it.

479
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Call it good.

480
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Yeah, all right.

481
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Dave relatively quiet over there.

482
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Dude, I'm listening now.

483
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
That's that was pretty legit.

484
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And yeah, squeezing your brain, you're not talking about that for a while.

485
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
And that particular case was kind of cool because I didn't know that I was going to be leading that, you know, taking point on the initial conversation.

486
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
But a couple days prior after we talked about it, I started thinking about it.

487
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Dave, calm as a came in, can you can you take lead on the Eiffon line on Wednesday, like absolutely I've heard him thinking about it.

488
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Which was also a really cool thing that I didn't think about when we were talking about the squeezing your brain.

489
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It makes you feel more prepared about things that life in general.

490
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Not that I was trying to produce, I wasn't thinking to produce some thing for the Eiffon line module.

491
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
That wasn't why I did it.

492
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And then when he asked me, I'm like, yes, absolutely.

493
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And then I spent more time creating that, you know, but I'd already been thinking about things to make the connection because we've been doing that so much.

494
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And the world has been changing for a lot of people.

495
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
God it.

496
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And I just started spending some time squeezing my brain, not to produce something that was for a deliverable or a client request that wasn't about the outcome.

497
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
It was about doing it.

498
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And it was pretty interesting how those two aligned.

499
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And it's like, hey, can you do this? I'm like, actually, no factor because I've been thinking about it.

500
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So you've been getting kind of broad questions from clients about how do we adapt to what's happening and you started squeezing your brain to figure out.

501
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Yeah, way to explain that.

502
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
That would be very clear.

503
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And it would make people connect the process of doing it to a story, which makes it easier to understand.

504
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Well, the stories are important.

505
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
But as we've, as we've been continuing to answer questions,

506
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
you have to find more ways to convey that message.

507
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Some resonate and some don't as well.

508
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
And sometimes what would go on a month ago is actually a little bit different than what's going on now.

509
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000
So I wanted to think of more effective ways to be able to communicate things for people to listen to and do something about.

510
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And that was what the squeezing the brain was initially for me is I have to be better in explaining what I think is going on.

511
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
So people can do a better job dealing with it.

512
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And if I just kind of go with the same way I've done it that little role with the ex I've got, like I'll just go back to module B coming like, well,

513
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
module B doesn't always work for everybody.

514
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
It's made it makes me smarter like you described, but it also makes me more effective for those people.

515
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So I was just thinking about it in those terms.

516
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
And then he's like, hey man, can you do this?

517
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

518
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And of course, we've been talking about it.

519
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And I've been thinking about it a lot in general in a whole bunch of different ways.

520
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And it isn't always just like, what can I do to convey further people?

521
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I actually more about me and just getting better at thinking about things and getting better at making decisions, getting better at solving problems.

522
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Because I actually am not as good as I need to be on that, not even close.

523
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Yeah, the idea that what you're talking about is learning.

524
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
That's what we're talking about.

525
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:38.000
We're talking about learning and learning can be a passive thing where you're waiting for someone to show you the way or it can be something that you're proactively engaged your brain in.

526
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Yeah.

527
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And I think this book, I can't remember exactly.

528
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
This idea of this learning being continuous process, the biggest weight against me personally.

529
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
This is probably true for a lot of folks.

530
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Continue to do this is looking back and be like, I have to pretty well for myself.

531
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
You know, I'm at this stage of my life.

532
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I've accomplished these things.

533
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And that's the biggest weight against continuing to do this.

534
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And this is what keeps me from getting complacent.

535
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
It's what keeps me from getting comfortable.

536
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
What I've already done.

537
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
I think we we we laughed about it the other day. I was telling you like I actually forgot I was in the Marine Corps for 23 years.

538
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Because I'm so focused on trying to figure out a whole bunch of other things that I'm not good enough at yet.

539
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And it's actually healthy to not rest on the laurels of whatever I did in the past.

540
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Because that actually isn't enough to keep me moving forward.

541
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And if this actually is continuously going to do this, you have to do this thing all the time all the time.

542
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Don't you find though.

543
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Reverse kind of over laying new information on what happened in the past.

544
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Speaking of the F online, I did that today.

545
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I was talking about.

546
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Mike's really it's we covered up when Mike's really was on the podcast.

547
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
The first thing I did when Mike's really checked in this asking a bruiser, he's checking in late is I gave him a counseling, a written counseling.

548
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And I was explaining why I did it.

549
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And I actually like back then whatever it was 15 years ago or something like that 15 years ago when I met him.

550
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
If you would have said, why did you do that?

551
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
You know what I was said? Because he checked in and he needs to be squared away or something like that.

552
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I would have given this.

553
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But if you would have actually squeezed my brain at the time and said, wait a second.

554
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
No, Jocco.

555
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
You're in a leadership position.

556
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
You take action because for a reason.

557
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Tell me why you actually, why did you actually decide of everyone that's in task in a bruiser?

558
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
You got this new guy coming in.

559
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Why is it him that you've decided at this point in time that you want to give him a written counseling the minute he checks in?

560
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And I was thinking about it.

561
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And I was squeezing my brain and I realized a couple things.

562
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
And I was trying to convince him to have a better one. He was coming from a task in it that just self-destructed.

563
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And I didn't want to any of that drama.

564
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Number two, I wanted to know that I was serious about what we do.

565
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
And the last one, the one that I had to squeeze my brain to get to is I didn't know Mike.

566
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And we were going to deploy in a few months.

567
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And I needed to know who this guy was.

568
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
I knew who is a primary and who is a prior recon and who is prior sniper.

569
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
And I, but I didn't know him.

570
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And so by me taking this young officer,

571
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
date the minute I meet him and say, yeah, come talk to me.

572
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
And I hand him a counseling sheet.

573
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And when it said something along lines of, hey, there's no drama in task in a bruiser.

574
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So don't bring any drama in a task in a bruiser.

575
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And Mike was like Roger that.

576
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
They need to sign it.

577
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And that moment where I saw his reaction.

578
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Yes, what this whole thing was really about. It was really just a test to see who am I getting.

579
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Is this guy have a big ego? Is this guy have a bad attitude?

580
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Is this guy think he smarter than everybody else?

581
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Is he, when I say, hey, I want you to sign this counseling.

582
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Should he be going to say, this ridiculous, why should I be yours?

583
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
You're going to roll his eyes at me or is he going to, you know,

584
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Huff and paw for whatever.

585
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
This is ego going to come out.

586
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
That's, that's the purpose.

587
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And I can now look back and see, hey, totally.

588
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
That's, that's, that's one of the reasons why I did it.

589
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And that all came from that all came from the fact that I was talking to this other woman on

590
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
EF online and talking about the Willy Wonka,

591
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Freaking example of how you test somebody.

592
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
The end of, you ever seen the movie Willy Wonka, echoed Charles?

593
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
The original?

594
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
No, sir.

595
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
That's pathetic.

596
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
The end of the original Willy Wonka, he goes off berserk and tries to get the person to

597
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
change his mind or to reveal himself as either being a thief and untrustworthy or being

598
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
trustworthy.

599
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
So I had explained that to him.

600
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
And so now I could see clearly why I'm doing this.

601
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
So even though you might say, I forget about being the Marine Corps and I get what you're saying

602
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Like it's, it's, yeah, I get what you're saying, but, but the reality is you take

603
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
What, you take this new thing that, this new thing that came out of your brain

604
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And you overlay it on the past and you go, oh, this makes,

605
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
This makes total sense now.

606
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Oh, I totally see why I would do that.

607
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And so it's a little reverse engineering.

608
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
It's actually a lot of reverse engineering, but it also reveals, hey, where did I make mistakes?

609
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
What did I do wrong? Why did I do? Why did I back this way when I shouldn't have?

610
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
If you want to take the things that you've learned and turn them into a little bit of

611
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Wisdom that might be helpful for you or your kids or the people around you,

612
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
You have to do what you just described.

613
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
And that's been the part that I've been wrestling with as I look back and think I did a lot of things.

614
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
But I didn't think about why I was doing them nearly enough to be as wise or articulate as I should be to look back.

615
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And so I didn't taking those lessons now, and I was just one of a million different things I could think of and think

616
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
What were we really doing when we were doing that?

617
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
And if you don't do that, all it is is an experience and the thing that matters the most is what you took from that

618
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Not just for you, but for the people around you, if you want to create some wisdom from that, you have to do what you just described

619
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And that was one of a million more things I have to do, and that's part of the reason why I was so fun

620
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
As I took this cool story from Top Gun, I'm like, you know what?

621
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
I didn't really think about why we're doing, there's a big thing what we're doing it

622
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And I didn't really think about it, and there is no way I would have thought, could what we were doing now

623
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Somehow be helpful somewhere else down the line other than rebased line and Top Gun training for this next aircraft

624
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
That's what I thought we were doing, that is not what we were doing

625
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
There was so much more going on there, and the squeezing of my brain is trying to create a much larger context

626
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.000
For all these things that I did in those 23 years that I look back and I'm like, dude, if you want this to be useful, you have to think about it a lot more

627
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Yeah, and it's crazy that when you see the patterns, the pattern recognition over time, you go, yeah, that's what I was doing there, yep, that's

628
00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And for me that a lot of that stem from GJ2, because that's when I started connecting the dots of, oh, you don't want to attack an area that's reinforced in on the battlefield in GJ2 or in as a leader

629
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000
You don't want to attack an area, okay, I got that, oh, you need to maneuver, you need to, you need to be able to move, right?

630
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Think about that, just think about that concept in GJ2

631
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:22.000
When you get, when you get immobilized, you are on the way to defeat the minute that you can no longer move, you are on your way to defeat

632
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Well, on the battlefield, if you can't maneuver anymore, if you dig in and you can't move, you're on your way to defeat, and mentally, if you close your mind and you stop thinking and seeing other perspectives and keeping an open mind, you are on your way to defeat

633
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So when you start taking these and seeing them in other areas, it opens your mind up, it frees your mind in so many different ways and that is learning, that's what it is

634
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
All right, little preamble

635
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:10.000
So chapter 3, the learning environment, it is necessary for us to learn from others mistakes, you will not live long enough to make them all yourself

636
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
That's, that's a, at Marickover

637
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Next one, our knowledge of circumstances has increased, but our uncertainty instead of having diminished has only increased

638
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
The reason of this is that we do not gain all our experience at once, but by degrees

639
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
So our determinations continue to be assailed, incessantly, by fresh experience

640
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And the mind, if we may use the expression, must always be under arms

641
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So new things are going to come about and you got to be, he's using, he's using kind of a different metaphor

642
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I'm saying keep your mind open, he's like you got to be ready ready to adapt, keep your mind under pressure

643
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Yeah, under pressure, exactly

644
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Next here, victory does not necessarily go to those who have the largest or most modern forces

645
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
But to those who are able to recognize the need to adapt, generate intelligent decisions and execute them more quickly than their enemy

646
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Victory does not go to the person who's the biggest and strongest

647
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Echo, yes sir

648
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
It goes to the person who can adapt, who can make intelligent decisions and execute them quickly

649
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Skipping ahead in the progress in the progression of learning, training should provide marines with an opposing will to practice against

650
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Through repetition and a training environment marines loaned out think adversaries and over-completion

651
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Prior to encountering these factors during real world operations

652
00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Therefore marines must integrate lessons learned from current and previous conflicts to adapt their learning environments, methods, assessments and feedback to reflect evolving threats

653
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Got a lot of questions about this one

654
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
A lot of questions of how do I get my mind ready to do this?

655
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
It's easy to sit here and talk about it

656
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Hey, you want to be adaptable, hey you want to be able to detach, you want to be able to handle pressure

657
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
How do I actually do that?

658
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Oh, you got to put yourself in those environments

659
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
You've got to go against an opposing will in order to practice

660
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Sparring

661
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
That is due to yes

662
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
You know what what is a barrier?

663
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Well, for you it might not be underrated because you have seemed to know the importance of it

664
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Value but role play right like role playing scenarios or whatever

665
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Yes, we do 100% see the value right, but that role playing goes deep though because and I

666
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
I don't want to say I learned it for me, but you really

667
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
You brought it to light the importance and how of how

668
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Good it it works, but just how easy it is to do so I think like okay, so I'll make kid

669
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
He's three and I'm going to say hey, don't like wine or whatever

670
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And they'll be like what or don't be what I say you say you stand up straight and say yes or when I say your name

671
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
You say yes or I don't require them to do that, but it was like a practice to have a certain attitude

672
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
So like I say if I say your name you say yes sir don't say what don't say like that

673
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Say when I say your name you say yes sir and he's like okay, you know

674
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
No role play like okay, so next time it happens I expect you to do that kind of

675
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Think but I said no, no, we're going to go through it this practice so I do it like two times

676
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Took like what 30 seconds not even 30 seconds now every single time

677
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
But I got to say it in a certain tone, but still it's in his head now

678
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
You know because he's sort of been there zoom's in rather than just some idea on a paper or out of my mouth

679
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Whatever yeah, the value of role play is equivalent to the value of rolling in jjitsu

680
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Sparring essentially what sparring is just playing with additional motivations of course, but yeah

681
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
I mean that's really the story that you're letting with is what we were talking about earlier is everything we did at top

682
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And it was role play because nothing was live you're not fighting against your real enemy and our problem is it

683
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
We were role playing against somebody who wasn't good enough to make it better and like hey I'm doing everything right

684
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
I'm winning and that meant I was going to but the role play the other person in that role play wasn't wasn't role playing a

685
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Hard enough situation for us to be effective

686
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Yeah

687
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And just like jjitsu you want to

688
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Yeah role play against the best possible opponent you can look can you over do that yes, you can if all you do is just get smoked and I bet you guys at top

689
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Conest instructors had to back off all the time and we had dialed we did we dialed by design and we knew what we were doing

690
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
But ultimately you there has to be someplace where the role play isn't designed just so you can win the role play is designed so you can be challenged correctly

691
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And then you know we're going to talk about adaptation but the more effective your counterpart is the more you have to adapt the less effective

692
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
They are the more you can just stick to your plan and you win and that's a really bad lesson is like I just keep doing what I'm doing

693
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
I'm going to be okay. Yeah, the more effective your opponent is the more pressure you put on your brain

694
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
It's right and the better results you're going to guess the more money learn. It's going to shake out of your hair

695
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Is there learning environments there's not a single correct design for creating the ideal learning environment because each learning objective

696
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Marine team and condition will differ therefore Marines modify learning environment to most effectively meet their the learners needs and reflect the conditions that they expect to encounter

697
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of the potential solutions to the problems and encourages Marines to explore alternative courses of action

698
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I had to highlight that part because effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of potential

699
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So that so if at top gone what you did was said

700
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Okay, Bill on this run you're going to go up you're going to do this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver

701
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000
And you're going to do them in this required timeline like you could create some false pressure with the required timeline they would get good at doing this maneuver this maneuver

702
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And then as soon as a real thing happened and they got a wrench thrown into order you came out of it. You just annihilate them same thing as you did so or the old school

703
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.52
The cutters if right that cutters in whatever traditional martial arts here's the move you know there's a downward frosting blow from your opponent you do the

704
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:56.000
Ex block and then whatever you do these coordinated moves which is what made those type of martial arts when you have see started or when they were doing NHB in in Brazil or Valley 2-Doh in Brazil

705
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Then the traditional martial arts that had been not learning in this way not learning for flexibility of thought and reasoning and creation of potential and what they didn't train for that they trained for a downward frosting whatever

706
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And when they got an upper cut or a leg kick that they did not work against they were dead in the water

707
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Same thing with when I was training what was what the seals that's how we train the seals we're not training hey here's the here's the

708
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Here's the here's the here's the next maneuver that you're going to do is call bay a center peel

709
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Now walk down the ravine and when the whistle blows you guys do a center peel actually that's how we start off right that's the beginning

710
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And I'm sure there's maneuvers you guys taught a topic hey here's the maneuver here's what you do yes but eventually you got to figure out what maneuver you're going to do when you're going to do it how long you're going to do it for what's your next maneuver going to be

711
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Yeah, and what little change is you're going to make to that maneuver in real time because it's not going to be the road application of that maneuver you learn

712
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
It's going to be a variation of that

713
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Trying to expand people's brains and

714
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Effective learning in back to the book and effective learning environment enables marines to clearly understand the intended war fighting doctrine concepts tactics techniques procedures and learning outcomes

715
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It clearly identifies the expectation for the learners

716
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Whether exercising marines critical thinking in problem solving skills or understanding circumstances where a medi'd obedience to orders or

717
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Application of specific basic skills such as good marksmanship are required so there's times where you are going to just straight up say Roger that got it

718
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And then there's times where you're going to have to push back or get creative

719
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Additionally effective learning environments provide opportunities for marines to execute the required repetitions under different conditions to achieve competency

720
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Have you ever read the book outliers

721
00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Gladwell, yes, yes, so one of the things that one of the experiments that they go through in that book is there is they're training two groups of kids to throw a ball into a basket or something like that not a basketball, but just a ball into a basket

722
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.000
And there's one group of kids that do it at varying distances five feet seven feet four feet three feet eight feet

723
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:21.000
The other kids are just doing it at six feet every single time test day comes the baskets at six feet

724
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Guess who does better echo Charles the six feet people nope really yep. It's the people that had the variety of flexibility

725
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:39.000
They trained and they were able to outperform. So that's counter-induitive right we think ages do the same thing that's why

726
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
That's why like the multi-sport athlete has this extra capability and they tend to do well

727
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I just watched a documentary about different really successful athletes that that oftentimes not all the time often times the player that does the best is not the best

728
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:09.000
The best baseball player is not the player that just played baseball. It's the player player that played football basketball and baseball and then when he was 14 he focused on baseball

729
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
But he had all this different athletic training. He was more capable with his body and yes

730
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
In moving his body through space

731
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:29.000
With force. Oh, I had to go deep on that one. Yeah, first and foremost the learning environment focuses on the learner's needs enabling Marines to understand

732
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Develop and retain the necessary knowledge and competencies they will use in combat fast forward. Although marine strive for learning efficiencies

733
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Improving the learning environment does not necessarily mean making it more efficient

734
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
For example, though rope memorization or reciting fast can be very efficient and useful for developing basic knowledge such as memorizing standing orders

735
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
They are not effective methods for all learning effective learning often requires approaching material from different perspectives

736
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Applying information in context and explaining how why accents occurred in addition to what occurred

737
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
How many times echo Charles have you heard me say

738
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.000
You learn an arm lock from a different professor and from different angles it will make your arm lock better

739
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So if Dean Lister teaches you an arm lock he's going to show you a couple details if I teach it to you it's going to show you a different detail if Jeffy clever teaches it to you

740
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
It's going to be an even different detail and each one of those different

741
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Left, these different perspectives is going to make you better then if you when you learn the arm lock from the mount, but then you also learn it from the guard

742
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Both the arm lock from the guard and the arm lock from the mount both to get better

743
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Yes, many times yeah many times better

744
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
So

745
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Learning from different perspectives

746
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Important tool important tool you got to have

747
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Fast forward

748
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Setting the conditions for success recognizing these surfaces and gaps requires awareness

749
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Honesty and judgment because they are often unique to the individual or the specific unit a surface in one learner or unit may be a gap in another

750
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:30.000
It is incumbent upon leaders and instructors learners and their peers to actively seek out these gaps through continuous and aggressive reconnaissance

751
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Learners should not hide gaps in their knowledge instead they should exercise intellectual humility to identify and fill these gaps in order to improve

752
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Intellectual humility

753
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
That's huge man

754
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Yes sir

755
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
That is not easy to do

756
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
To infern your peers especially if you're in charge

757
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
If you're like the leader of a team or an organization or even the instructor

758
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Which you know my time at Top Gun anything I can think of where I was the leader of the team that intellectual humility

759
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
We call that a brutally honest self assessment

760
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Yeah, and what's interesting is that

761
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:30.000
If you think if you're not going to be humble and you're not going to admit your mistakes you're going to look stronger to your troops you're completely and utterly wrong

762
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Yeah

763
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Yeah, that when you say it's not easy to do

764
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
If it's not easy to do and you choose subconscious your consciously you choose not to do it actually intellectual humility that is and you choose to hide your gaps

765
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
What's the called surfaces gaps gaps gaps in the knowledge

766
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:59.000
If you choose to hide your gaps in knowledge and you and that's sort of the way you are that's just how you get good at hiding the gaps and then you become

767
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Essentially successful at hiding the gaps then you get that so that will stunt your learning in that way the how it's it I mean actively yes, but it makes it harder and harder and harder as you go on

768
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Yeah, you know, so because the more you hide your gaps and the more you're committed to hiding the gaps

769
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
The more like when you get start to get exposed or you're gonna hide your gaps

770
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Yeah, and also you can only hide your gaps for so long

771
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I mean people recognize it when you don't have that part of your game

772
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
It's not like people don't know it man

773
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Yeah, and I'm thinking you get 200% where you know those guys where it's like man what they don't want to roll with certain guys

774
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
You know like it's everyone sees it everyone sees what you're doing

775
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Marines mitigate weaknesses by leveraging their strengths to form new understanding and focus on learning to eliminate gaps

776
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:01.000
This can only occur when learners first acknowledge their weaknesses and resolve to leverage their strengths to build meaningful connections

777
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Should we make a poster that says that you know I mean like just so important and so seemingly obvious and once again

778
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
You wonder why someone would have to take something so seemingly obvious and put it into a book

779
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
It's because even though it's seemingly obvious it's hard for people to do

780
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Next section is called the expeditionary nature of learning

781
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Marines recognize that to be effective war fighters

782
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
They must be warrior scholars

783
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
They must seize initiative to study the profession of arms whenever and wherever learning opportunities arise

784
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000
And once again, I like I like how the the Marine Corps manuals just state things as a matter of fact

785
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000
If you're a Marine then you obviously recognize that you need to be a warrior scholar. That's just how it is

786
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Now that goes into a little subsection here

787
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:18.000
And it's talking about force on force exercises to simulate wars complexity force on force exercises are purpose driven learning environments that are approximate the complexity of war

788
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
When developing such exercises Marines focus on designs that enhance problem solving and promote decision forcing events

789
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
This enables Marines to practice and better understand how to get inside the enemies decision making process

790
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
There is no substitute for fighting against a competent realistic thinking adaptive enemy

791
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Even if that enemy is simulated by other Marines this practice ensures that challenging learning environments provide a place to practice

792
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Develop experience allow errors adapt and learn how to fight and win

793
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000
That's the very premise of top gun need this to say

794
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
That is the very premise of top gun that is the very premise of the advanced seal training where you are in fact fighting against other seals all the time

795
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And what's

796
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000
What might be hard for people to grasp and you might even be able to have a more linear exposure to this

797
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
I could watch a young seal officer

798
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Get better at decision making events

799
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I could watch a young seal get better at being in chaotic situations

800
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Taking a step back, detaching, looking around, figuring out what the possibilities are, choosing a course of action, executing it

801
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I could watch someone get better at that

802
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
It's hard to

803
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
It can be hard to quantify what that

804
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Like what that actually looks like but I'm telling you I'm trying to tell you what it looks like

805
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
It looked like this why I think you might be able to give a better example

806
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
You'd see a young seal day one going through land warfare training

807
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
And or day his first

808
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
We'll call it field training exercise

809
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Or his first immediate action drill in an uncontrolled environment where he doesn't know what the call that he's going to make is

810
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Pertrolling out there, boom the targets pop up the simulator start going off

811
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.000
His people react and the first time it happens to him he's totally overwhelmed

812
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Doesn't know what decision to make he's shooting his gun he's looking around

813
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
But not with any purpose no call gets made eventually the platoon chief goes

814
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
He'll be right or whatever

815
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Then you know you're debrief him you go hey what were you thinking about when the shooting started

816
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Well, I saw that target out ahead of us okay what else did you see?

817
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
You didn't see anything else did you?

818
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
No, I didn't see anything else okay cool next time

819
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
I don't want you to even chew your gun

820
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Okay

821
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Same thing happens now at least the debrief he says yeah, I kind of saw that I saw that little piece of terrain we could get by

822
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000
That that seemed to be a good spot and then chief made the call milk. Okay, so you're your your eyes opened up a little bit more

823
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
And this continues down the road until finally he can actually make a decision on his own in these pressure environments

824
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:27.000
So you can watch someone get put into the chaos and get better at handling it over time

825
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
What did it look like at top of them similar?

826
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Yeah, very similar and what I was actually thinking with that is when you're talking about the progression is the end of the progression

827
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
You know we'd go through this multi-plane environment, which is I think more replicates what you were doing

828
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Not just the one against one, but multiple friendly aircraft and multiple enemy aircraft and it appears as if the enemy could give you any number of an infinite number of

829
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Possibles options to attack us, but we actually didn't do that we had not quite scripted

830
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:05.000
But some of the basic formations of basic ways we wanted them to do it and at the beginning of those phases the student leaders would come back and just be like completely overwhelmed and by the end

831
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:14.000
They wouldn't be they'd be and they would ask hey, what are you doing so what's so much different about these last runs I've been doing well and you're like nothing nothing

832
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.000
And it's when they you would see them starting to see what's happening and then their minds are thinking wow

833
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
They're dialing it back or they're making and we weren't changing anything but that they were able to see that time was slowing down

834
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Their decisions would make more sense and they'd ask the question of hey what change and like hey man nothing change here what you're able to do now is see and so the parallels there

835
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Amazing how similar are those two situations are and it also goes to show how much more thinking I have to put into how we were doing the training and where at fits elsewhere other than just making pilots ready to go to war

836
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Yeah, I would get asked the same question

837
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Hey, thanks for back and off tonight. I'd be like hey, thank you for using utilizing decentralized command and letting your subordinate leaders go on the assault

838
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Yeah, go on the attack go on the offense because when you do that my guys are pinned down. They can't do anything you know how many guys I had tonight out of out fighting you how many four you know how many had last night four you know how many had the night before four no change in the number of opt for you're going against

839
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000
What's what's changing is your ability to lead is your your team your subordinate leaders ability to step up and make things happen

840
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Your ability to give good guidance your ability to make decisions your ability for your team members to make good decisions because that's the other thing that makes it really drastic is as

841
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Eight fire team leaders all of a sudden you know when when they show up two of them are kind of proactively making things happen and then it becomes three and then it becomes four and then it becomes five and then it becomes six out of eight fire team leaders are proactively getting after it

842
00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:04.000
It's going to be hard to contain and that's when I would have to step up I wouldn't back off. I would step up my trade at guys. I'd be like, okay, hey, we need to bring it. We need four more guys. We need to put somebody over here and we try and screw them over

843
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:22.000
But we wouldn't be able to beat a good task unit with good decentralized command with simple calls doing cover move prior we couldn't we couldn't beat him you could not beat that right so you can get better at this stuff.

844
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Fast forward a little bit. Marines guard against complacency because they know that their adversaries are always watching what the Marines are doing and they are constantly making changes to adapt in an attempt to defeat us.

845
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:46.000
If Marine settle for what they think is good enough it may result in high-cathlete rates for the next fight.

846
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Marines just FYI are not complacent next question.

847
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:12.000
A learner centric model this is the next section is called a learner centric model. The learner centric model ensures that content is relevant to learners actively engaging and challenging Marines in a positive instructional climate.

848
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:29.000
For example, discussions on problem solving between the learners and leaders and instructors are an effective method to motivate learners and build teams as they analyze information, consider alternatives and work together to develop a solution to the problem that's posed on them.

849
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Now I am going to venture to guess that some of this section is aimed at an old philosophy of training which existed in the military well I definitely existed in the SEAL teams which is hey we're going we're here you're going to do what we tell you to do if you don't do exactly what we tell you to do it's because you're all screwed up.

850
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And you need to do it what the way we showed you which does not promote this whole idea of thinking and learning and developing.

851
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You know hey you you you you you enter that room wrong.

852
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:30.000
This is probably one of the first little. First little things that I noticed as I'm peeling back my career when I was at team one.

853
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And I was I would be instructing and I was never the lead instructor but I go out we'd be doing some close quarter combat training and someone would do something.

854
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Make a decision and some of the instructors some of the more old school instructors would say something along the lines of you went left that was wrong.

855
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Hey why did you go left and they'd say well when I approached the door I looked at the hinges I could see which way it was going to open and I thought it would be the quickest way and you go okay.

856
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Here's the thing and maybe there's a rebel that maybe there's a hey listen you wait just you know you can't you can't presume that because you saw this that's going to happen maybe it's the wrong but maybe you go okay.

857
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And I used to say to guys hey you did what you did you did what you did look you're going to be going in the house as you've never been in before that's the whole goal of this that you can go in a room you've never been before and you're going to react how you react we need to understand why you're reacting that way if it's if there's a better way to do it let's think about it.

858
01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But let's not. X out what you did as if this was the wrong thing by the way you don't get a second chance in combat you did you whatever you just did you just did and now you got to deal with it.

859
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Think about from a leadership standpoint to what actually helps that person more than you could do something like jacca that was wrong.

860
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:37.000
You actually made do it the way I told you to do it maybe you will maybe you won't maybe you're just stubborn you're gonna not but you're going to just do what you do.

861
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You're going to get you're going to get you're going to do that but just by asking the question and you and I almost knew what you're going to say was hey just tell me why you did that it doesn't mean that they're still right.

862
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But it means that you actually want to understand what they were thinking and if you understand what they're thinking it's so much easier to train and work with them that if you're just trying to force them into what you want them to do.

863
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:07.000
That's incredible is this section captures that whole thought process in the title of the section a learner centric model so if you're a trainer you're an instructor.

864
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:25.000
So often people set up instruction as if it's around me right this instruction around me hey this is how you doing arm lock right this is how you do watch me and then do what I just did instead of hey let me see your arm lock you know does this Dean Lister.

865
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You do something and when we were at camp up in Maine people would say hey.

866
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Pete so awesome and I'd be like oh why they'd say he was he came from across the room so giant mat space thousands of square feet of mat with a hundred people on it and they'd say he came from across the room.

867
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Hey I see where you're putting your foot on this position and it'd be better if you'd move it four inches over here to the right try it and then it would work.

868
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So it's learner centric it's not about Dean it's actually about the students and that's a Dean's very good at that it's fully it's fully about the learner it's a learner centric model.

869
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:33.000
The Marine but I think I think that there is an old school mentality of instruction in the Marine Corps possibly I was never in the Marine Corps but I did go through multiple training events with the Marine Corps and I definitely saw some instructor centric models.

870
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And I think actually Dean dealt with some instructor centric models Dean went up to do some combat and training with the Marine Corps and the instructors were there.

871
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And instead of them being like okay well how would you do this Dean Lister multiple time world champion did you do how would you do a rear naked choke and said they were saying we do it like this.

872
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And Dean said okay try that on me guess what there's some holes in the plan.

873
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Check.

874
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Next section self and the caveat haven't thrown it out there yet no I'm not reading this whole entire book we're skipping big chunks you can get it yourself it's free it's online it's PDF you can download it the Marine Corps is very generous with their knowledge.

875
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Next section self directed learning like mission tactics self directed learning benefits the leader and instructor by giving the learner more ownership and autonomy.

876
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Which enables the leader or instructor to focus on learners who need more help or to explore alternate ways to improve the learning environment.

877
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The commander leader instructor or mentor agrees to provide the learners with the necessary support and guidance to help them accomplish their missions without unnecessarily prescribing their actions.

878
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Oh these Angela's command.

879
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
We we want you to know how to do this we want you to take ownership of what you learned.

880
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Why because then you're going to be more invested in it.

881
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Just.

882
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Good to go.

883
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Vicarious experiences critical because even the most realistic training experiences in military education fall short of the reality of combat.

884
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Therefore the more vicarious experience that a marine obtains.

885
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It the less likely that a new experience in combat or otherwise will be completely unique yes you cannot simulate everything.

886
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I used to joke about this if trade it I would say.

887
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Unfortunately I can't just shoot you guys you know and they laugh because we do everything else.

888
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I was standing with the commanding officer of a sealed team as one of his seal task units was out in the.

889
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Out in the desert in the Imperial Valley of California and there was total may I'm going on and we both have radio is on were listening to all the calls getting made their strobes going off.

890
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
There's there's explosions going off there's communication.

891
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:22.000
We're just all this is happening and it's we have the perfect view there's guys on the rich and we're looking at like a bowl.

892
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
A valley and then guys are up on the ridge lines and you can see them all from our vantage point.

893
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And I just looked at him I said there is no better training in the world for a guy's been what these guys are you so realistic it was so.

894
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So crazy.

895
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But my point was even with that there was things that you can't simulate you there's things that you cannot simulate and so you have to use these.

896
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Vicarious experiences so that people can learn.

897
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Continuing on Marines can use mental imagery to gain confidence prior to executing a skill emphasize key points in after action to reviews.

898
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Examine possible outcomes of decisions and explor options mental imagery also provides an effective mission rehearsal technique when using mental imagery a leader pictures himself or herself in the operation.

899
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Vividly visualizes different scenarios including possible branches and sequels and rehearses the decisions he or she may make given specific conditions and enemy actions this way.

900
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:40.000
The leader mentally prepares for multiple potential enemy actions and reduces the possibility of surprise when the enemy reacts now.

901
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
What you're trying to do is close the gap.

902
01:08:43.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Between how hard you can train and what it's really going to be like right and you can look you cannot fully get there you can't fully get there there's emotions that you cannot trigger unless someone is about could die right now right in jetzu right there's.

903
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:28.000
You train for mma not even jzu mma we can throw punches we can grapple we can exhaust them we can do all these things but you can't have them walking into the octagon of the ufc even if you and I used it like we when we used to spore we stood on Saturdays when there's a crowd here get the crowd to start commenting you can do all those things.

904
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:52.000
But that last little thing you cannot simulate you cannot simulate and so you want to build up you want to close that gap as much as possible part of it is through the training part of it is through these vicarious experiences and reading and learning about it but there was a guy on the uf online today saying hey I understand that I'm supposed to detach but there comes a point when it starts happening and I.

905
01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:04.000
How do I get ready for that yeah. And the thing was I the advice I gave him I was a little let's say I was a little nervous about the advice I gave this guy.

906
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Because I was saying hey you need to set yourself up for surprise things that you're not ready for you actually want to tell like if I want to get ready to defend myself and not freak out I need to tell echo hey man occasionally I want you to just attack me.

907
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And here's where you got to be careful if you do that let's say you go okay all right I got this and you start tracking on me and one night at vans.

908
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:50.000
You know I'm out there getting some picking up some steak and you I get into my car or whatever I'm getting in my car you spring out of somewhere and start yelling and screaming with a knife in your hand to see how I react and next thing you know you got to shit to to gunshots to the head.

909
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Right and how am I going to explain that one away right it's going to be tough.

910
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Yes. So we got to be we got to do after put some parameters around it because I don't want to shoot you.

911
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Wait that's what is that essentially I mean obviously not the shooting thing but that's what that's what your answer was.

912
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Well what I said was listen you know talk to your wife and have your wife throw scenarios at you and then I had to give the same parameters because if you go imagine if you said and I said listen.

913
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:28.000
But you want to practice being in these turbulent situations you have to be in them as close as you can get so I said if you tell your wife that say hey I want you to throw some just crazy stress at me.

914
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
When you know and don't even do it to me today or tomorrow wait like a week till I really don't expect it.

915
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000
But then I told him hey you need to put some parameters around us right because his wife might come home and say his wife might come home and say I've decided to leave you.

916
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I think he goes good I was going to leave you anyway all the stuff.

917
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Yeah, all the stuff.

918
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
All the stuff.

919
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
So we have to put parameters on it.

920
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
We have to think through it.

921
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
But if you really want to to get someone used to being under stress that's what you do you put them under stress.

922
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
That's what you do and it's hard to do that if you if someone knows it's a roleplay there's a little thing in the background of mine.

923
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But if they don't.

924
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Hey you can you can create a lot of stress on someone.

925
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah, if you fail that like those test scenarios that they spring out at you if you fail that test you can do some damage and you're really.

926
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
That's what I'm saying.

927
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You're going to be going to be a little bit of thinking too man because what if yeah what if your wife says like essentially a fake.

928
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yeah, like whatever I'm leaving you I'm mad at even like something small let's say okay.

929
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Hey you didn't take out that trash or whatever and just with a slight attitude what if I fail the test and it'd be like you snow my job I bring up something that actually does.

930
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Really in real life trigger her a little just a little bit for sure. She's playing the role, but a what if she can't detach either you know which is normal.

931
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And now it just escalates from there and there which started to be a test now.

932
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Man, relationship.

933
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's like the office the fire test with.

934
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's right right.

935
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's supposed to be a test now we got people throw copy machines out the window.

936
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, it's a military we grew up with something called and I assume you got the same thing we had something called the training time out.

937
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So, in this scenario like they'd brief the okay we're going to go do this training and if something happens that you exceed a threshold of whatever you put your hands up on a tea or you put your arm up and say time out and then we'll stop the drill.

938
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
We're just going to like rudimentary training you do that and so.

939
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Kind of always knew in the back of your mind like okay.

940
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
This could get bad, but if it gets too bad I can stop the training.

941
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What would be certain or what what would be like an example of my recollection of the first time that I was briefed on the training time out was during like the first week of TBS where we do swim call.

942
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The first thing you do swim call yeah the water is hey look if you know where there's five instructors there's 40 dudes in a put to and we're watching you but if you get to a place where you or you can't handle this you can throw the hands up and we'll see that will stop the training.

943
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So you can introduce this concept early on and then you know as you evolved in in fighter aviation we have the knock it off which is actually kind of like in someone is kind of like tapping so I can do this fight with you and we're finally if I get to a point where I feel like.

944
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I've reached a limit like I don't think this is safe anymore I can't keep doing this or whatever I can say knock it off and you will stop training you will stop being the aggressor say.

945
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But you don't get to do that in combat there is no training time out there is no knock it off but it's impossible for any training scenario to remove that thing of hey if your life is now at risk.

946
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
There is no training situation that we would love that to happen we would never get to a place where you're going to get hurt or killed to prove a point.

947
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:51.000
But you actually kind of know that subconsciously and so that limit is there that's the gap that's the gap that's right the gap is when you've got a platoon of guys and they're receiving.

948
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Enemy fire air quote enemy fire and one of the guys just gets up and charges you know the bad guy and it's great and he happens to get him or whatever but.

949
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And it goes both ways too because I used to explain that's what evens it out for our training what evens it out is the bad guys the up my up for they don't care if they die either because they they're going to get reset and we'll go again.

950
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:35.000
But actually the mousha had been often didn't care if they died and so they have an advantage there we care about our friends we care about our comrades and arms so we're going to fight a different way than the mousha.

951
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And that's just they don't care not all the time but that's a part of their mindset is hey if I die that's cool martyrdom case they would have suicide missions yes I we don't do that we don't really like hey the look you're going to die on this one I want to talk about the plane we don't do that no and they would have they would do that actually all the time yeah and that and that.

952
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:08.000
The I think the point by this there are things that you simply cannot replicate and that's that's one of them not just the risk to your own life that you're going to mitigate but the willingness of the other person to have no regard for that.

953
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah which is something it's hard you cannot get that gap will always persist until you experience it for the first time.

954
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Yeah and then you got to try and close that gap to the best of your ability and the way you do that is different instructors different angles and then as I talk about here vicarious living vicarious experience hey tell me what that was like from you and there's a chance that you go you know what oh I know what I remember this guy remember this I've seen this before.

955
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000
This whole book starts off with Matt is saying hey you shouldn't be surprised by anything you should have read about it there's no thing that you can't see something like that before.

956
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Which is what they're going for all right so going back to the book here go back the if to rewind a little bit so the whole test about the guy that you're.

957
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I'm giving advice to the you know okay have yourself tested what have you tested put yourself in the pressure scenarios yeah for detachment practice essentially.

958
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So.

959
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I think first I think those should always be at a level one that's I think just for safe if that's your meaning we don't want we don't want.

960
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I'll try to catch to hydroshots to the great yeah bonds parking lot yeah so I'm threatening my state.

961
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So if you're weak or let's say detaching in moments like that or part of your maybe weakness will say which is why.

962
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I'm actually a question for the training right so it is a weakness so we got to figure there's some possibility that I'm not going to detach I'm not going to see that you and I'm just cracking off my rounds.

963
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:52.000
So yeah so I think level one to I don't know this is my been but I think part of or it's the very least the beginning of the answer to someone with that kind of like a detachment kind of weakness or whatever.

964
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Is the leadership primer you call it yes okay so before you even said the word leadership primer.

965
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I would essentially prime myself by doing this and a lot of people do do this they'll like tell me this they'll be like what would jacco do in the situation like anytime a stressful situation came up or decision had to be made they'll be like oh what would jacco do.

966
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
In fact also make sure this is what would jacco do kind of thing and like yeah.

967
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So essentially thought the same thing but not what would jacco do but more like hey I'm the leader so what should the leader do right now you know it's like or and so along with being the leader is it's your responsibility.

968
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:47.000
You can you cannot it's against life rules to blame anyone else you have to take 100% of the blame and come up with 100% of the solution if someone helps you good but you have to come with 100% of the solution right now even if you're being attacked and feeling under appreciated blood blood 100% up to you.

969
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
To cut to to manufacture a good outcome right.

970
01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So so that's essentially what would jacco do right that's like the press well I would essentially prime myself like if something some stressful situation that's the rule like any stress that comes in some bigger small boom I'm the leader you just you have to essentially prime yourself into being like the leader and what's hard is.

971
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Is being primed right because you're you're not walking around like that it takes a long time to develop the instinct of your very first reaction your initial reaction.

972
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Is detached take a step back and take a breath and make sure you understand what's happening that's a really hard thing to train in yourself it's a really hard thing to train yourself so.

973
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:47.000
For the leadership primer which again this is the F online we got this thing called the leadership primer where you you know you can just press play leadership leadership primer it's me saying hey this is what you think about this and it just gets you in the leadership mindset because.

974
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:58.000
If you're there already that's one less step you have to say hey if I tell you hey echo you're going to walk in that room and you're going to get no fight.

975
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
If I tell you that there's a guy waiting to fight you in that room you are going to do eight times better than if you just walk into that room thinking about you know getting sushi.

976
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Right you're going to do eight times better minimal.

977
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
You're going to be ready you're going to be primed you're going to be thinking you're going to be looking for an exit you're going to be looking for an entrance you're going to see what is we're going to size up your target all that's going to happen the second you walk in there if you're not expecting it all it doesn't happen at all.

978
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So getting yourself thinking that way is absolutely important and you know I'll take this whole thing one step further.

979
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000
The idea of like what what would jocou do I get it as like a leadership primer.

980
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You actually have to ask yourself one level deeper than that which is for lack of a better way of explaining it.

981
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:57.000
What would jocou actually do right now because the surface answer of what would jocou do is like oh you just beat tf through this right that's the surface answer.

982
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's not the real answer and that's the difference and I did a bad job sometimes in the teams of guys that worked with me but they didn't they got the surface jocou but they didn't get the next level and so they.

983
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Go overseas and have to report to some army.

984
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Some army major that.

985
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.000
They didn't get along with and they think what would jocou do jocou would tell this guy better straight himself out no and actually that's the wrong answer.

986
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Jocou would actually develop an awesome relationship with this guy get to know him really well and start planning seeds in his head where we ran everything that's what jocou would do so it's a little bit.

987
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Deeper than that you have to go next level before we end up priming ourselves for.

988
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Hey if it's just like this if if I said okay echo when you go in this room someone's going to get attack you and you walk in first person you see you punch him in the face.

989
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And it ends up being whatever.

990
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Someone that didn't serve right.

991
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
That's a problem.

992
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Yeah you were overly primed and you didn't really think through the problem.

993
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So there's a there's another level there that you got to go.

994
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Yeah but to your point correct.

995
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:22.000
How can you get yourself primed you know I talk about leadership strategy and tactics there's a list of 12 things to do as a leader and like look you can't read this list of 12 things to be like okay good cool now.

996
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:31.000
No if you're a new leader and you check in before you go into the meeting with your subordinate or with your leader you just take a look take three minutes and read through the thing to be like all right.

997
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I'm thinking the right way. I've got my mind primed for what I'm going to go make happen right now and when somebody blames me for something instead of going actually my fault at all.

998
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
It said you go.

999
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Yeah okay like you know let me get out my notebook and actually write down what you're saying.

1000
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yeah.

1001
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So I can make sure I can get it fixed because I don't want to be the person that's responsible for making mistakes.

1002
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
But I'm ready to take it on and fix it boom.

1003
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah and and of course just to be clear too like I'd by no means I'm saying people hey do this this is what all you got to do or not all you got it this way you got to do.

1004
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
After some of what we're talking to I'm not like advocating that at all.

1005
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I'm saying that is a different way of explaining what I would do and it's so it wasn't like what would you go do it was what would like the leader quote unquote leader do and I used you as a reference and here's the thing I know you're second and.

1006
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Even sometimes third level like I know I think I do anyway it's been effective with.

1007
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Behaving like I do put it away.

1008
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So to me I just worked on being that way the whole time 100% at the time because it's easier to like deprive than it is to like prime one year like laid on the priming kind of thing situation in one of the situation arises you know.

1009
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah and here's where all this is hard right all this is hard is that.

1010
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:07.000
There's a gap that you got to be able to fill that's that's what this is all about the gap is I'm I can get primed for so much I can think about what I'm going to do and how I'm going to act and I'm going to make this call and if somebody confronts my ego I'm going to detach but then.

1011
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:17.000
The person that you didn't expect to confront your ego the person that you didn't expect to say a nasty comment to you that happens and before you can get.

1012
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Think through it you go well who you even be called out someone with what you did last quarter and all of a sudden we've got an escalation on our hands.

1013
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So how do you get ready for that the answer is you do these training scenarios and you as much as you can you say look.

1014
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Hey Dave I've been having a problem losing my temper with people can you do me favor and just put me through some temper tests.

1015
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yeah now look we got to put some safety parameters about it because I don't want to save the save the save the save says Dave says you know.

1016
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Hey Jocco this is a good example for you to set an echelon front if you're not even submitting this paperwork on time and I go.

1017
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Well you're looking even at echelon front Dave I don't even know why you're here and all of a sudden we have a real bra.

1018
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
About this right so let's put some control parameters in place I know and then immediately Dave called the creative time out because it's about to get you know we're about to do.

1019
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So if you throw everything under the bus why because you was role playing so yes you got to put parameters around it but other than that like if you want to see how you're going to react.

1020
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:45.000
No hydrish locks to your friends chest because they surprise you trying to steal your steak.

1021
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
You know who tries to get me to take some kind of a training time out.

1022
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Yeah see and that's the thing and that's a whole rabbit hole to bread there's so many ways to do that to call for a training time because.

1023
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Injutsu it's like sure there is the training time out straight up like hey that's one of them oh yeah like you can let's say I'm I'm you know maybe kind of injured or maybe just a super you know let's say I'm a smaller person less like physical capability against a crazy you know 21 year old.

1024
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:29.000
235 pound white belt spas right I can call a training time out I can be like hey like I respect you but this seems like kind of dangerous I'm not kind of training with you specific that's a training time out really.

1025
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You know you're going to have a high level you just to put your out of shape and you're going with the monster guy who's who's really good at you to get in the better you you're guessing you're like you're getting you can beat down is what and you kind of don't like that you can call it a little training time out.

1026
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The here's where the subtlety kind of arise you can like fake an injury you can be like oh like oh my finger was caught in your shirt your shorts or something to give you like.

1027
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And again it's a spectrum you can get like maybe 10 seconds training time out think about can do or you can give yourself maybe like a minute or guys used to do.

1028
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I remember rolling with a guy and he was a higher belt than me and I wasn't shaped I wasn't better than him but I was a guy kept going going going any kept like we're doing key and he kept like.

1029
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Coach take no no he take time to tie his belt again and like bro where are you and bro our belts fly off you just keep training right.

1030
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:35.000
He kept like to and the kind like flagrantly taking like 20 30 seconds to tie his belt they did like six times that's a training time out to the only thing about I think a training time out.

1031
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Is is known and the right side like a training time out you're talking about little tactics little sneaky little tactics to catch a breath.

1032
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I'd rather catch a breath over here so it's a little bit different but there are I mean tapping out as kind of a training time out.

1033
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah well a training time out would be like actually remember when used to be claustrophobic when you remember when used to be more claustrophobic.

1034
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You would kind of you're training time out was I look I didn't have a submission on you at all but you would tap out and to say I there was a guy when I was at team two that I used to train with and he would get so mad.

1035
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
And he would just go.

1036
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
He would just be just get off me and then I'd get off me like go.

1037
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:37.000
He would be so like mad at me as a person.

1038
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000
When you would make it known that you were trying to make me claustrophobic it'd be less claustrophobic.

1039
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.000
The most claustrophobic I would get from you is one like you'd be pinning me down and it seemed like this was part of your like tactic to like slowly submit me like.

1040
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I'd have this feeling like I'm never going to get out of this like situation and I'm probably going to die under here kind of thing but if you're like one time this is what you did you were like.

1041
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Oh you're better at your claustrophobic now watch it kind of you said something along these lines and then you put all your weight on and you put your feet on the wall.

1042
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So all your weight was on me and you're essentially saying whatever we're using you're saying like yeah like how does that feel kind of thing.

1043
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And I was like proud I'm not claustrophobic at all right now.

1044
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You want to know why you are primed. I told you I was going to do it you were ready for it you were ready with the resist.

1045
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Yeah and my mental state was kind of like this me gets you know if I'm against any claustrophobic situation like my mind that the battle is different.

1046
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah.

1047
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Interesting that is interesting.

1048
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Back to the book.

1049
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Marines need time to reflect on new learning experience to exploit their lessons self reflection internalizes experience and increases mental preparedness for employment across the range of military operations.

1050
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So you're going to think about what happened little thing about Madison here and then on to general Al Grey.

1051
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And they're the sum of what it's saying about that they're saying Marines need to make time to reflect in order to build understanding exploit lessons and be ready to adapt to situations change.

1052
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So you kind of have to debrief then you have to debrief yourself.

1053
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Next section the role of the instructor regardless of the location of location or position marine instructors are knowledgeable skilled competent and confident in their abilities.

1054
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Once again, this is a statement of fact.

1055
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That's the way marine instructors are their knowledgeable skilled competent and competent in their abilities.

1056
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Fast forward a little bit assessments.

1057
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Assessments are employed to provide learners with constructive feedback so that they can further develop professionally rather than an arbitrary test score that does not capture growth or change.

1058
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:10.000
The most effective instructors use the coach teach mentor approach to provide learners with constructive feedback.

1059
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You know, as we covered the code the evaluations and the protocols and I think I got asked somebody asked me.

1060
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Would you recommend doing this in a company, you know, in a company and I'm like, yeah, the biggest problem with the Navy and the Marine Corps evaluation systems is that they're annual.

1061
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So only coming out once a year, this idea here that you have to provide assessments more often than that. They don't necessarily need to be official, but you got to give people feedback.

1062
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Fast forward learners and instructors like should understand that Marines learn because of their errors, not despite them.

1063
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Isn't that a, isn't that a smart thing to think to yourself, is that my employees, my support, it's my kids echo Charles are going to learn because of their errors.

1064
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Changes your mindset a little bit when the kids make a mistake, it's their turn to learn.

1065
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Next section, technology and supportive learning. Just as MCDP one confirms that war is a human enterprise and that no amount of technology can reduce the human dimension.

1066
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:50.000
For learning environment is also primarily based on human characteristics rather than equipment. Technology can support expand an individual individualized learning. It is one of the many tools to support learning objectives. So look, it's it's a tool.

1067
01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Technology is a tool, but it doesn't replace the human element of learning. The conclusion here.

1068
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Battle is the ultimate test of military learning and training as Marines will fight is a time honored Marine Corps principle train as you fight. In preparing for battle Marines leverage the art and science of learning along with helpful technologies to enhance learning environments.

1069
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Taylor learning experiences and provide constructive feedback to accelerate learning.

1070
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:38.000
There you go. And now we get into the last section of this chapter for the learning leader.

1071
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Hmm, it all just kind of comes together in this section for doesn't it the learning leader leadership and learning are indispensable to each other John F Kennedy.

1072
01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:00.000
The future operating environment will place new demands on leaders at all levels are leaders must have the training education and experience to meet those demands.

1073
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And that's general done for 36 common done of the Marine Corps and the 19th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1074
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And the last quote throughout history the difference between brilliant brilliantly performing armies and mediocre ones has always depended on a small handful of combat leaders.

1075
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And that is Dave Berks friend John Boyd.

1076
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Throughout history leadership has been the most important thing on the battlefield.

1077
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Small handful of combat leaders.

1078
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:48.000
When you're in a in a what's it called when there's a whole bunch of airplane in the sky one of those all those airplanes together called.

1079
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Is that like a squadron is that a is at a wing.

1080
01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:04.000
So if you're going on a on a soul when you call all those aircraft together we'd call an air wing in the Navy and ring or and if you're going you would you go on a mission like I would go on a mission with a seal puttune you would go on a mission with an air wing.

1081
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Everybody you'd be the air wing and there's smaller components of that you know you'd have like.

1082
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Section division a section that's right you'd break them down much like you know fire team squad things like that.

1083
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Is it true or is it is it also true in an air wing on an assault that a couple combat a couple good leaders good pilots can make a big difference that is true.

1084
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Oh really absolutely.

1085
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
We're working together in pairs basically is that the smallest unit that we're working in.

1086
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Yeah, despite the fact that there is an erling a there's a Marine Corps air you know madtuff an air wing component in the Navy has an air wing the most common formation that we go out there is a two sometimes a for ship but a two ship formation we call to this section.

1087
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Is the most common warfighting element when things break down into individual implementation.

1088
01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And how many how many aircraft how many sections would you go out roll out on on a.

1089
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:11.000
On a mission that you would train for a top gun and the reason I'm saying that like I like when you talk about and you have multiple aircraft like sort of the FTX scenario the final training exercises.

1090
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
How many aircraft are going out how many sections.

1091
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Top gun with the culmination of a top gun would be four sections be eight aircraft eight aircraft going out to assault the target then some some bogeys come out.

1092
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000
A lot and they are going to try and bring it and so does the.

1093
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Do the sections have a overall leader yes.

1094
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
If that guy's not quite as good, but there's a couple pipe hitters in there all the difference in the world all the difference in the world.

1095
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I think all the same fundamentals that you've always talked about if you put them into.

1096
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Leadership in the air it's exactly the same thing.

1097
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It you do not have to be the mission commander to be the most influential leader in the formation.

1098
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Logitech.

1099
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
When you go with the air wing to found Nevada.

1100
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:15.000
How many how many aircraft roll out on those mission now you're talking you know you could have 20 now you'd have much much bigger much more complex different missions all at the same time a lot more coordination 20 aircraft plus sometimes.

1101
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And that's the carrier group going up to found to run big exercise is getting ready for deployment and a carrier group would be you know three full squadges a 12 you'd have a squadron of six you'd have a squadron of four you know you'd have 40 50 airplanes in an air wing.

1102
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I did that trip.

1103
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Three I did three strike group carrier interoperabilities and found yeah which is just so so lucky on my part as I was a rate for for two of my was ready.

1104
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I mean for one of them I was the Jay assistant to commander but just the amount of visibility that gave me.

1105
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Because it wasn't normal for seals to do that trip we would have a couple seals that or station up there.

1106
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000
But we but to actually get up to be able to go up there and go in the field and do all the closer support very very healthy.

1107
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yeah we did some long patrols to from one end of that valley over to the other end.

1108
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:20.000
12 12 kilometers and a night lay up for the day recover a down pilot 12 kilometers back out the next night.

1109
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Did you ever get to be the down pilot up there?

1110
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
No never did.

1111
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1112
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I know you got to assign the down pilot.

1113
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Because that guy had to walk half those.

1114
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
It was not a job most people would.

1115
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Yeah they didn't seem to be chilling too.

1116
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Isn't winter time?

1117
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah we did every air wing and every every course went through you to have a down pilot scenario.

1118
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And you send a guy out there.

1119
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Side track two things and two things in my time in the seal teams.

1120
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Where I got to see something in nature that a normal person doesn't get to see.

1121
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000
One of them locked out of a submarine in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

1122
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000
And it was it was the brightest blue is a daytime or a lunar rehearsal.

1123
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
It was the brightest blue.

1124
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Most beautiful ocean and it was not it was incredible visibility.

1125
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And there was like a pot of dolphins coming alongside of us and just swimming.

1126
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
That's number one.

1127
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Number two.

1128
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I'm in Fallen Nevada.

1129
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I'm in a helicopter.

1130
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And it's early spring.

1131
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So there's still snow on the ground.

1132
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And we're flying nap of the earth up through these hills.

1133
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And we come across a pack of wild moustangs horses that are charging through the mountains.

1134
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And we're we're we're so low close to them.

1135
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And they're and we're like slightly above the tree line or whatever.

1136
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I don't know if there's a tree line, but there's no trees.

1137
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Very black shrubs and these things are just charged.

1138
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
It's big pack of wild moustangs.

1139
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It was freaking epic.

1140
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I want to cool things and I've ever seen.

1141
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
In nature that's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

1142
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
All right.

1143
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:07.000
So leaders at all levels are responsible for their own learning while supporting their subordinates development.

1144
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Each marine is either a leader or a future leader, whether by rank or by their experience and influence on other.

1145
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
You know, that's something I said at the early moustards.

1146
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I think I said it every moustard, but that would say training is the solemn duty of the leaders.

1147
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Because if you got some training command and they're not doing what they're supposed to do, you need to still do it.

1148
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
You need to make it happen. You're in charge of training.

1149
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:38.000
You're in charge of education. You're in charge of making sure people learn.

1150
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
An excellent way to master a topic is to endeavor to teach it well to other Marines.

1151
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Marines can develop leadership skills and improve communication skills through learning.

1152
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Marine succeed with leadership styles that provide clear intent through mission type orders and decentralized execution.

1153
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
We are in full support of this document.

1154
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
You want to get good at something, by the way? Teach it.

1155
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Yeah. Teach it. Do you think your leadership capabilities improve since you got to ask your own front and you teach leadership?

1156
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I wrote a note when I was going through this myself. I wrote down the word leading is teaching.

1157
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I was just a note. I just put in the margins. I was just running through this document a couple of times.

1158
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
The answer to question is yes. I do.

1159
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
That is a...

1160
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Yeah. So it's...

1161
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You... just even though you describe it, it can be a little bit of a slippery slope.

1162
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
You said as a leadership instructor, echelon front,

1163
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
was kind of implies my job is actually to teach.

1164
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I'm an instructor. I'm here to teach leadership and as leadership,

1165
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
leaders at all levels were responsible for their own learning.

1166
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I assure you that at a minimum, it's equal and the truth is it's probably tenfold my favor.

1167
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I have learned way, way, way more than what I have taught.

1168
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
In terms of like, what I get at...

1169
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Because every time I teach something, assuming I do the things we talk about,

1170
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I learn something while doing it.

1171
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And I've told youth as a bunch. That's been the biggest surprise of my second career.

1172
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Was having to acknowledge if how much more that is for me to learn out there.

1173
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
So just that title leadership instructor. If you have the word instructor anywhere in there,

1174
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I was at Top Gun and Shutter, whatever it is.

1175
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Your job is actually to learn and then help impart that with other people.

1176
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Not just that you are the teacher.

1177
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I got so lucky that when I was at Sealtime 1, as a young and list guy,

1178
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I eventually went into the training cell and taught and taught everything.

1179
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Luckily, and just seeing it, teaching it, you get so much...

1180
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Such a much better understanding of the subject that you are trying to teach.

1181
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
That's the coolest thing about being a student at Top Gun is that Marine Corps

1182
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
sends you to Top Gun to come back to be an instructor just in your squadron.

1183
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You don't have necessarily the title of instructor, but as a Top Gun graduate,

1184
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
especially when you are on the boat, if you are not flying, there is really not much else to do.

1185
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So you are training. That's all you are doing. You are training.

1186
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And so every brief, everything you are doing, it doesn't mean you teach all the briefs.

1187
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000
It might be that you take a brand new guy and go, hey, you are going to give a brief on how the countermeasures system works in the F-18.

1188
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And you in my mind, I might know that thing, like I could draw that thing out down to the battery.

1189
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
But this guy doesn't know anything about it.

1190
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But as the Top Gun graduate, you are responsible for either teaching or training every single thing that goes on.

1191
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
That is the coolest part about being a Top Gun graduate is that you are the focal point

1192
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
of making sure the squadron gets trained. And so you get to be part of all the training evolutions.

1193
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
How many Top Gun instructors on average would there be at a squadron?

1194
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Two. If you are really lucky, sometimes you have a third patch where pretty common, one, maybe two.

1195
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yeah, they ended up kind of buying necessity, but also just by design.

1196
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000
And it kind of ended up that when I was in the field teams in the early days, you would go to training cell,

1197
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
add a team, the team owned their own training cell, and you'd be in there.

1198
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And if things worked out because you were whatever, you didn't have orders for a certain amount of time

1199
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
or you had already done a bunch of deployments that put you in training cell.

1200
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And a lot of guys didn't want to go to training cell because hey, you know, why would you want to go to training cell?

1201
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
You're there to deploy. And I went into training cell as I was putting in my officer packages.

1202
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
So it was, hey, going to training cell and it'll give you some time to get, because otherwise it's what are you going to do?

1203
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Do another deployment. Of course. Of course. I'm going to go do another deployment.

1204
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Luckily, the master chief, Master Chief faculty, you know, he told us if you want to get good at this stuff, you need to teach it.

1205
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.000
You need to come in here and teach it. And thank God because that's was hugely that had everything to do.

1206
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Because you're de facto detached when you're struck by the way. When you're watching guys do immediate action drills out in the field,

1207
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
you're watching guys clearing rooms, you are de facto detached. You're literally watching that.

1208
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
So you can see these mistakes. And if you pay attention to it, you can learn a lot from it.

1209
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Marines hold a special relationship with each other that is akin to the relationship of mature siblings.

1210
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
They build each other up, share experiences, and hold each other accountable.

1211
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:31.000
This relationship begins with shared experiences in entry-level training and instills shared understanding of honor, tradition, and the importance of leadership.

1212
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
These are your brothers.

1213
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Learning is necessary to leadership strong leaders promote learning in subordinates.

1214
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Needs no explanation whatsoever. Thank you, nice, his Marine Corps.

1215
01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Foster and encourage the next section. Leaders model and set an example of learning for the Marines in their charge by openly seeking out and pursuing professional development for all Marines, including themselves.

1216
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
In italics. Yes.

1217
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The number one person that you should be getting to learn is you.

1218
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
J.P. was reminding you many other day that at some point I said, hey, you need to start re- it.

1219
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000
This was when we were back in times. And I told him, hey, here's these websites. You should look at these.

1220
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:27.000
You know what's going on in the world. You know, just not even news, but more intel kind of driven websites.

1221
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And it's I didn't remember.

1222
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000
As soon as you reminded me, I remember doing that. But that was me saying, hey, man, you need to know what's going on here.

1223
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:52.000
As stated, MCDP-1, which is warfiting, a leader without interest in or knowledge of the history and theory of warfare, the intellectual content of the military profession is a leader in appearance only.

1224
01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Self-directed study in the art and science of war is at least equal and important to maintaining physical condition and should receive at least equal time.

1225
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.000
You should be working out and studying the profession of arms.

1226
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Leaders who set an example with their actions and words that learning is important for the profession of arms inspire other Marines to learn more about the profession and its application.

1227
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Marine leaders prioritize learning for themselves and others taking an active role to foster and encourage marine learning.

1228
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Leaders foster learning by engaging their Marines taking interest in their well-being and supporting their professional development. Leaders are justifiably proud when their marine succeed.

1229
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Conversely, leaders help them overcome the stakes when they struggle.

1230
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Leaders do not wait for mistakes or failures to highlight a learning opportunity.

1231
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:59.000
They provide subordinates with the sufficient freedom of action to learn and develop without seating responsibility to monitor supervising correct subordinates actions when necessary.

1232
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:07.000
We cannot rightly expect subordinates to exercise boldness and initiative in the field when they are accustomed to being over supervised in garrison.

1233
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:13.000
The goal is for Marines to seek learning opportunities on their own accord even if the leader is not present.

1234
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:24.000
They've embedded decentralized command into the process of learning in the Marine Corps, making it a part of your very being.

1235
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And if you don't do that, you're putting your Marines lives at risk.

1236
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Factual.

1237
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Teaching and leading. Next section. Teaching and leading cannot be uncopled.

1238
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Think about that one, echoed Charles.

1239
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Marines who cannot teach will struggle as leaders. Strong leaders do not perrate a subordinate for making a first mistake.

1240
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000
They turn mistakes into teachable moments.

1241
01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.000
If you imagine if you don't have control over your temper, someone makes a mistake and you lose your temper, you're just thrown away an opportunity for someone to learn.

1242
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
You've squashed their initiative. All kinds of problems.

1243
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Leaders in Kyrrhus Marines pursue learning opportunities and cultivate an open dialogue to discuss lessons learned when mistakes are made.

1244
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000
It is the leader's responsibility to recognize act on and correct the mistakes by turning them into learning opportunities,

1245
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:32.000
understanding that it's far better to learn in a training environment than to make mistakes when deployed.

1246
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:45.000
You know, it's the idea that you're going to take people's mistakes and turning them into teachable moments.

1247
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
There's like another kind of thing that I would see.

1248
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And I still see it.

1249
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And that's this underlying, the underlying ego that gets involved.

1250
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:06.000
The little thing, the little thing that you can't let out of to make this teachable moment for you Dave,

1251
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
because obviously this was a little bit tricky for you.

1252
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You know what I mean? Like there's that little thing and even that right there.

1253
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Even that right there.

1254
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Detracts from the learning moment.

1255
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Just when I let my ego shine through my beaty little eyes and tear it into your ego, it's just detracting from the teachable moment.

1256
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
What does that look like just like the way you say it?

1257
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:43.000
The way I say it, the way I come across with, hey, hey Dave.

1259
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Clearly that question kind of stumped you on the web.

1260
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
You know what, why don't you want you, why don't you want you, uh,

1261
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
why don't you give me a call later to my, I can help talk you through it.

1262
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
You know what I'm saying?

1263
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Yeah, the whole, that's the whole five.

1264
01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
The whole presentation.

1265
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
It also lets the other person know what you think of the relationship.

1266
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
This is kind of the nature of our relationship.

1267
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Yes.

1268
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I'm here to mentor you.

1269
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
We get this question all the time.

1270
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
It's like, hey, I really want to have a mentor.

1271
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I think your answer is actually really good.

1272
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
It was like, hey, I never like assigned a mentor or assigned myself as a mentor.

1273
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Either one, you should try to learn from as many people as you can.

1274
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
But the one that I would see get people fired up the most is when someone

1275
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
to go, bro, I'm trying to help you here.

1276
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And that would send people off all the time, which was, hey, I'm doing you a favor.

1277
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I know something you don't know.

1278
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And I'm here to help you learn even that would put someone who, and look,

1279
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
the ego is in both sides because if you were to say that to me,

1280
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
even like that would be like, right on, what do you got?

1281
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I mean, that would be my goal as a how I'd respond to that, which is easier,

1282
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
easier for some people than for others.

1283
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
The ego's on both sides, but totally control your own.

1284
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
You can only control it.

1285
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Even if Dave has the most, the most totally humble attitude he's open,

1286
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
that's great.

1287
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I got lucky, right?

1288
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000
But any other guy is going, well, you know, actually, the way you talked about it,

1289
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
yesterday did even make sense.

1290
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Yeah, all of a sudden we're in a combative mode.

1291
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
What do you know?

1292
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Maybe I'm just running a little training drill on him.

1293
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
A little ego to check.

1294
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
A little bit.

1295
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I'm sure he's good.

1296
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Yeah, I see that out today.

1297
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I was like, I would my ego to or my test on Jamie.

1298
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I was like yelling, like pretending like I was going to yell at Jamie.

1299
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Did you know you were pretending?

1300
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yeah, well, I was just using it as an example.

1301
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Okay.

1302
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
But Jamie was just smiling because she knows, oh, I know,

1303
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
factually that Jamie would be like, okay, Joc, I appreciate it.

1304
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Let me go find out because she would just be escalated because she's dealing with this crap all day long.

1305
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
You know, that's what she does.

1306
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
You know, you know, so she keeps it real.

1307
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Real, real, real, real.

1308
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
All right.

1309
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
General John A. Lajoon 13th,

1310
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Commodanda Marine Corps, World War I, general.

1311
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:04.000
The relations between officers and enlisted men should in no sense be that of superior and inferior,

1312
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
nor that of master and servant,

1313
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
but rather that of teacher and scholar.

1314
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Now I want to hold up right there because that right there is not correct.

1315
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And if there's a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps

1316
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:25.000
and he's working with his gunnery sergeant, he is by no means by any stretch of the imagination,

1317
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
the teacher to a student at all.

1318
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
It's the opposite, actually.

1319
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000
So I think, you know, if you were to take a look at this in present tense, it would read a little bit differently,

1320
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
goes on.

1321
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
In fact, it should partake of the nature of the relations between father and son.

1322
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Again, that's not a great analogy because if unless you're now flipping it to the gunny is the dad

1323
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
and the second lieutenant is the son.

1324
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000
To the extent that officers, especially commanding officers are responsible for the physical, mental, and moral welfare,

1325
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
as well as the discipline and military training of the young men under their command.

1326
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That is true.

1327
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Yeah, I mean, I think I'd picture this in the context of being a senior officer with young,

1328
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
junior, and listed very young, junior, and listed Marines.

1329
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
But this to me kind of highlights some of the problems with the chain of command.

1330
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
The chain of command actually can be really good.

1331
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
It's good to have a good chain of commands.

1332
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I've been a well-defined hierarchy, but there are huge pitfalls in that because

1333
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:30.000
organizationally, as soon as you figure out who you are in the organization, you presume to take on some sort of set of roles that comes with that.

1334
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I think I'm very first podcast.

1335
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
You, I haven't talked about my very first job as a lieutenant.

1336
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I got lucky because I had one of those guannies that was like right out of the dream scenario.

1337
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Who do you want to be mentoring you in your first job?

1338
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
It was this guy named Gunny Pilgrim.

1339
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Who was like, you couldn't make a better Marine who was my subordinate.

1340
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I was his boss, and in no way was I leading him or teaching him or doing it.

1341
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It was a one-way relationship where I just learned everything that possibly could from him.

1342
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Because he was the type of gunny that knew where he was in the chain of command, but also knew what his job was.

1343
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:16.000
But it actually does require you to look at where you are in the chain of command and detach from that piece and say,

1344
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
where am I in this relationship?

1345
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And what do I actually need to learn from this?

1346
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And if you can view it like that, the chain can have really a sort of insignificant there.

1347
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Because as a junior officer, I had nothing constructed to offer this guy.

1348
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Nothing.

1349
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Gunny Pilgrim.

1350
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Gunny Pilgrim if you're listening.

1351
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
He knows what's up.

1352
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.000
We're going to have to bring him on here and get some good stories about second lieutenant.

1353
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
We should bring him.

1354
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
You weren't second lieutenant, huh?

1355
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
You were first lieutenant by the time you got to.

1356
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Yeah, yeah.

1357
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Leaders who, and so that ends that quote.

1358
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And like I said, there's some just some perception that quote that I think is a little bit off.

1359
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
A little bit off.

1360
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I think it's more like if you, if you just to say universally on this quote,

1361
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
universally what Marines are to each other, Marines are to each other.

1362
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You know, because I can always learn. I can learn from the most junior guy.

1363
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I can learn from the most senior guy.

1364
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
So just depending on what dynamics are happening in that relationship,

1365
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
you know, I might be the master in one situation in 20 minutes later.

1366
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
You're the master, right?

1367
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
That can happen because there's different parts of knowledge.

1368
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And you got to be open and flexible to do both those.

1369
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Continuing on, leaders who encourage and open discussion with their Marines about how

1370
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
some actions contributed to outcomes will have greater successes at teaching,

1371
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:49.000
compared to leaders who simply point out mistakes for Marine to improve upon without context or explanation.

1372
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Yeah, then again, I think that's some old school at least in the seal teams that was more old.

1373
01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And it wasn't always like this, but there would certainly be some guys in the seal teams in that when I was in the 90s

1374
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
that their role as an instructor was to point out your mistakes and tell you how to do it right.

1375
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Not a conversation, just in just instruction.

1376
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That direction is like wrote memorization.

1377
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
You tell me to memorize something?

1378
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Cool, I'll memorize it. I'm actually really good at memorizing things.

1379
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I'll memorize it.

1380
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
But I really don't want to really want to do is not memorize something.

1381
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I want to learn how to calculate what to actually do based on thought.

1382
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:36.000
A little note on here about constructive feedback.

1383
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000
The goal is not a simplistic discussion of the right answer, according to a leader's personal views,

1384
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000
but rather for the Marine to develop greater self-awareness and understanding of the situation and task,

1385
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
and to be able to adapt the lessons learned for future situations.

1386
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Again, not memorization.

1387
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:07.000
When I went to college, some of my classes were, I wanted to get an A on the test.

1388
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Yeah, you said this about OCS as well.

1389
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Or did you go to OCS or TBS?

1390
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I was talking about TBS.

1391
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Yeah, memorize this.

1392
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Hey, Roger that.

1393
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I will memorize this.

1394
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I will make flashcards.

1395
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I will memorize this.

1396
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And it would have been so much better if every minute that I had spent memorizing things,

1397
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I was actually having a legitimate conversation about what the meaning of these things.

1398
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
So learning and the mission.

1399
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Yeah, totally.

1400
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000
When I went back, we talked about, I think it started with the first one when we did war fighting.

1401
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Which everyone we did, the first Marine Corps Doctoral Pub, you and I did together.

1402
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
When I went back to start reading these again, and we've read a bunch of them,

1403
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I read this last one when I was laughing.

1404
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I had so much fun reading this.

1405
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I had no fun reading these pops.

1406
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I read all these pops at the basics school.

1407
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
All of them. I didn't enjoy any of it because I didn't have this.

1408
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
I wasn't there trying to learn.

1409
01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
And the mistakes that I made, I think I've said this several times, looking back.

1410
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000
If it could just figure out how to take the things out of there and have it make sense

1411
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
and you're heading to learn something from it, it's actually fun.

1412
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Learning is awesome.

1413
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
And I was going back through these pops as an adult.

1414
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I think in my experience reading this, it was nothing like this the first time.

1415
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But a total waste, so much I could have taken from that.

1416
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.000
So I could have learned so much more, so much faster if that's how I viewed reading these things.

1417
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Yeah. Well, that is a big part of the very nature of this podcast.

1418
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Is, hey, don't just read it.

1419
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I'm not just reading this section.

1420
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000
And that's that. How am I putting it in context with what I've been through?

1421
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
How are you putting it through context with what you've been through?

1422
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:59.000
And then how can someone that's listening take that and tie them together and say, okay.

1423
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Yeah, there's, you know, as soon as you hear me read from a book and then say, oh, that reminds me of,

1424
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
I'm just at that moment in time, giving you another angle,

1425
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:20.000
another piece of context, another way to triangulate that idea in your own head, which is what makes it worth.

1426
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Otherwise, otherwise, people just grab the audiobook or just read the book. Yeah, cool.

1427
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I read the book.

1428
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I even, for me, for me, getting, of course, more out of it than anybody, because I'm reading it and thinking about it.

1429
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And then overlaying and then getting feedback about it.

1430
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
So it's this, it's a, it's a, it's a exponential.

1431
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Exponential learning. It's an exponential pressure on my brain.

1432
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Very lucky to be in that situation.

1433
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Continue on, for example, providing topic areas for discussion using the

1434
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Socratic method asking and answering questions to simulate critical thinking, draw out ideas,

1435
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
and identify underlying assumptions during during debriefs rather than simply criticizing

1436
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
the brain's actions can be much more effective in fostering learning.

1437
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Positive feedback is constructive positive feedback makes learners aware of what they did correctly.

1438
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Reinforces desired behaviors and identifies areas to improve negative feedback that

1439
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:30.000
unnecessarily tears them, rain down seldom leads to effective learning and can stifle initiative.

1440
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It's a different mindset. This is the type of thing echo when you're talking about

1441
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:43.000
timing, you know, and priming your brain. If you're an instructor situation, just reading that right there before you go

1442
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and instruct your class is going to help you. It's going to help you teach and it's going to help

1443
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
be a blog.

1444
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
The next section oddly enough is called humility.

1445
02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:02.000
That's the name of the section by the way. It's just humility.

1446
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:10.000
When you are a 15 year old kid and you are thinking about which branch of service you are going to

1447
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:17.000
join and then you are very rapidly coming to the conclusion that the best branch of service to you for you to join

1448
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
would be the Marine Corps. You are not thinking about humility.

1449
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You are not thinking about humility. You are thinking, we are the best.

1450
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
The Marine Corps is the best. I'm going in the Marine Corps because they are the best.

1451
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
You know, humility and that whatsoever.

1452
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
And you end up realizing that that's wrong.

1453
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And one of the things that makes the Marine Corps great and makes any organization great is humility, which is why they have a section called humility.

1454
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Here we go back to the book. All Marines, especially those in positions of leadership, can learn from anyone if they are ready and willing to learn.

1455
02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:03.000
However, ego can hinder learning. Commanders, other leaders and instructors learn from the Marines in their charge while also leading those Marines to learn.

1456
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
So this is what we just said. I can learn from anybody.

1457
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I can learn from anybody in the chain and command.

1458
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Leaders recognize that humility is a part of the career long learning process.

1459
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
The best leaders at the highest levels recognize that the more they learn, the more they need to learn.

1460
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And they set the example for their subordinates.

1461
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.000
How much you don't know. That's the initial stages of Getsu.

1462
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:45.000
After like your third class, when you think you mastered the whatever, the two moves that you learned and then you realize, oh, wait a second, this never stops.

1463
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Effective leaders also recognize that we are not an expert in every topic.

1464
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.000
So we seek out those who are experts and learn from them regardless of relative rank or position.

1465
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.000
The Marine with the authority, the Marine with authority must make decisions, but until a commander has reached and stated a decision,

1466
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:12.000
subordinate should consider their duty to provide honest professional opinions even though these might be in disagreement with the seniors opinions.

1467
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.000
As I call that pushback, I want pushback, I need pushback. That's how we pressure test our ideas.

1468
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
And of course it's the Marine course. They throw in until you've made your decision.

1469
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000
As long as that decision comes forward, we're going to get on board with the program.

1470
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Hey, what if it's illegal and moral unethical? We're still going to pushback.

1471
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000
What if it means, hey, we could get a lot of guys died killed here unnecessarily.

1472
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:44.000
We're still going to pushback. We need to substrategy and tactics cover that whole thing in agnostic.

1473
02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.000
When we were at top, one of the things we had is something called a standardization board, which is like the,

1474
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.000
all the senior instructors to get together to make these really hard decisions. Big decisions that had to be made.

1475
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:02.000
And as you might guess, you get 26 people in a room, all top gun instructors, all kind of the top of their game,

1476
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:09.000
you'd have really, really strong opinions. And I think what stood out to me with this comment isn't like the idea,

1477
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000
hey, I've made a decision. I want you to get on board. Once we've actually gone to the map,

1478
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
we've talked to everything. We've made a decision. What I need you to do is be on board.

1479
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Not that you can't dissent, but what I can't have you do is walk out and be like,

1480
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000
yeah, we're doing this. It wasn't my idea. This is really stupid. But that's what the boss said.

1481
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000
It's not the same as, hey, we all argued we put it out there. Maybe we wanted an ad direction that isn't what you wanted,

1482
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.000
but it's still going to work. And it's a good idea where we can still do this. And you come out and go, hey, listen,

1483
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000
there's what we're doing. This is why I'm on board with this. Those are two very different things.

1484
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
So questioning those things. There are certainly times to do that. But just because you didn't get your way,

1485
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000
doesn't mean that it's wrong. It actually might mean that you need to just get on board,

1486
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
because you might be the one that maybe you got something to take from that.

1487
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
So when we had these stand boards kind of the standing rule was when we're done,

1488
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
if you were on the losing argument, that doesn't mean you walk out and go, yeah, well, I lost that argument.

1489
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
This is stupid. I'm going to do it, but I'm not really going to do it.

1490
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I'm trying to sit in here, I was kind of racking my brain over here thinking about,

1491
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000
why is it that me, I in my experience,

1492
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:27.000
was never, was rarely that I can even remember in a situation where I was saying,

1493
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:35.000
hey, guys, here's what we're doing. Why is that? Why is it that throughout my career and life?

1494
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:40.000
So seldom that I can't remember an example of where I said, hey, listen,

1495
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.000
we're not, this is the plan we are going with. Why is that?

1496
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I was sitting here trying to rack my brain and it's pretty obvious and it's like this.

1497
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
If Dave comes to me with his idea and his idea sucks,

1498
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
it's very easy to explain to him that his idea sucks and he goes, yeah,

1499
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.000
you just poke 14 holes in my 15 ideas. So obviously, that's not scored away.

1500
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
So that means it's pretty easy to win an argument when you are that right.

1501
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:21.000
When you are that right, it's pretty easy to win an argument and I'm decent at arguing.

1502
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000
So if Dave comes to me with a crappy idea, it's not hard for me to go,

1503
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000
yeah, Dave, I get what you're trying to say, but this, this, this and this and Dave goes,

1504
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
okay, I'll go back to the drawing board. So that's one reason,

1505
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:43.000
because when I'm right about my decision, it's because you're freaking just wrong.

1506
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000
You've come in with a bad idea. So that's that's half of the solution.

1507
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's half the reason why I'm not saying, hey, everyone, no more discussion.

1508
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
This is what we're doing. That's 50%. The other 50%.

1509
02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Is because when Dave comes to me and says, hey, here's what I think we should do.

1510
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And it's 13 or 12 of the points are pretty good.

1511
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
And even though I could lock down 15 out of 15, I'm totally good with going.

1512
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Sounds good, Dave. You win. Roll with it.

1513
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
And what does that mean? The amount of times, because otherwise, if I say, no,

1514
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Dave, my 15 ways, my 15 points are better. And you're like, no, my 13.

1515
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
And we get an argument about it and find they say, shut up and go,

1516
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
do what I told you to do. And now you go, do it.

1517
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
You resent it. You're pissed off and whatever.

1518
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:39.000
But 50% of that's not, or 50% the solution for me is, hey, you're so wrong that you can't argue with me.

1519
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
And I don't say that, but I just point out all the things.

1520
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
You go, yeah, good point, good point, good point. And you're not going to,

1521
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000
you're not going to fall on your sword when you are just blatantly wrong.

1522
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
People don't do that. Even the most, even the most dug-in person when they get

1523
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.000
shown the 19 reasons why they're wrong, they retreat.

1524
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000
So, therefore, we all go out with the same plan, or you come into plan that's free

1525
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000
and close, and I go, sounds great, man. Let's execute.

1526
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Coming down the chain of command, meaning how many times did someone tell me,

1527
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000
hey, Jocco, shut up and do what I told you to do? Again,

1528
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
racking my brain a little bit of can't think any off the top of my head.

1529
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Why? Same thing. Most of the time, when my boss had a bad eye

1530
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000
idea, I was able to articulate and convince him of a new way of doing it that

1531
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
made more sense, or I was able to say, you know what?

1532
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
That'll work. I can make that work. I can make anything work.

1533
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I can make that work. You know, this isn't a suicide mission.

1534
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
This may not be perfect, but I can go out there, mitigate the little downfalls.

1535
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
No factor. So that's why when I read these things, it's like, I know what

1536
02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:00.000
they're talking about, but I very rarely experience it, very rarely experience it.

1537
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I can't even at echelon front. The amount of times I've said, all right, guys,

1538
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
lock it up. This is what we're doing. I think we've talked about one of them is like

1539
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
a PT evolution at the master, master of four or something.

1540
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Where there was a crazy plan floating around. I was like, you know what?

1541
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
There's a lot of risk with that plan. There's no risk with a known plan.

1542
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Hey, we're just going to go with a known plan. We have, by the way, we have a minute.

1543
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yes, by the way, we got like seven minutes execute this thing.

1544
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
We got to make a decision that that's like one of the few almost every other time.

1545
02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And if we would, if I would have done a better job saying, hey,

1546
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
brief me, I want we're going to need a tomorrow and we can do a dry run and all that.

1547
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I would have been able to say, hey, we could have gone through the cycle of actually

1548
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
figuring out, hey, whether that plan would have worked, which it might have or

1549
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000
be what little adjustment we need to make and then everyone's happy.

1550
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:51.000
This mentality of open discussion, so by the way, all this revolve all

1551
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
around open discussion, right? All this revolve around meat, listening, you talking,

1552
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
you listening, me talking, it all revolves around that.

1553
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
This mentality of open discussion hinges on the leaders of willingness to

1554
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
remain humble and accept the honest feedback.

1555
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Therefore, all Marines prepare themselves to become leaders by exercising

1556
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
humility and being open to constructive feedback.

1557
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Boom, this is a message to everyone in the world.

1558
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Continuing on, the path to mastery starts out, starts with a sense of humility.

1559
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
The path to mastery starts out with a sense of humility.

1560
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Marines recognize that they do not know everything and therefore must

1561
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
remain humble as they pursue greater understanding and competence.

1562
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Marines should always recognize that there will be more to learn and they

1563
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
must embrace their curiosity in order to continuously learn.

1564
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Curiosity will lead Marines to knowledge required to fill their own gaps and

1565
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
experience and improve their skill set.

1566
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
And that curiosity is tying back to what I started this whole thing off with me

1567
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
like wanting to know a better way, is there a better way to do this?

1568
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Is that tradition right? Is that standard operating procedure correct?

1569
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000
When a Marine begins to feel more confident, it is because he or she is closing

1570
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.000
the gaps between their goals and their actual capabilities.

1571
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Reaching a goal along the path to mastery is an indication that it is time to move

1572
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
on to a more challenging goal.

1573
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Boom.

1574
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Next section, technical and tactical proficiency.

1575
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Marines begin their pursuit of mastery by developing brilliance in the basics of

1576
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
technical and tactical proficiency.

1577
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
At all levels, technical and tactical proficiency requires

1578
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Marines to reflect upon what they have learned, identify learning gaps and

1579
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
close them.

1580
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Self reflection enables Marines to evaluate the quality of their practice,

1581
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000
recognizing that deliberate, purposeful, quality practice leads to mastery.

1582
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Incorrect practice and lack of focus does not lead to perfection.

1583
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000
It leads to negative training that could be transferred into the battle space.

1584
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Marines focus on doing a basic correctly building speed and agility.

1585
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
No, no reason to get crazy.

1586
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.000
It's a pick and roll.

1587
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
There are many technical skills that Marines learn.

1588
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Some are standard battle skills training.

1589
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000
And others vary across military occupational specialties.

1590
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Marines build foundational technical skills such as marksmanship and operating

1591
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
as part of a team in entry level training.

1592
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Marines learn to be technically proficient as riflemen which provides a common identity

1593
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
among all Marines.

1594
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.000
The larger lesson for Marines for all Marines to learn is the hard work, dedication,

1595
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
and persistence required when seeking self improvement.

1596
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
That's what you're learning in boot camp.

1597
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
That's why every Marine is a riflemen.

1598
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Yeah, look, do we need you know how to work your rifle? Yes, we do.

1599
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.000
What's more important than that is the lesson that you learn that it takes hard work,

1600
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
dedication, and persistence.

1601
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
That's what it takes.

1602
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000
That's what you learn from becoming a riflemen.

1603
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Marines build on this lesson as they move onto the next technological challenge.

1604
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And then it kind of advances here into the larger picture.

1605
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Marines develop teamwork and competencies so that they are technically and tactically proficient

1606
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
as individuals, teams, units, and mag tasks.

1607
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Collective learning experiences build teamwork that enables success.

1608
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Teamwork building exercises provide the opportunity for Marine leaders to both lead the development

1609
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
of the Marines teamwork and learn from these exercises.

1610
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.000
During these learning activities, leaders who demonstrate humility by discussing what they did and why

1611
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
subordinates to reinforce learning at all levels of the team.

1612
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Learning takes time, dedication, intelligence, and the pursuit of mastery.

1613
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And the reason I had to call this out is that in an organization, the organization is collectively also learning.

1614
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:19.000
That's the big separation between like basic seal training and even when you get done with basic seal training,

1615
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
then you go to seal tactical training or when they call it now.

1616
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
A seal qualification training, both those are pretty much individual skill sets.

1617
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000
It's not until you get into a seal platoon, now it's collective learning.

1618
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Now you're learning how to do things as able to, which is totally different.

1619
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
And yet builds upon what you learn to do as an individual.

1620
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
What was the training you led?

1621
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Was the title of that training? Was it West Coast seal training? Was that SQT?

1622
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
What was that called again? I know that's not.

1623
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Pretty deployment work up. Pretty deployment, pretty pre-deployment training cycle.

1624
02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I usually call it advanced training even though technically the if you looked by the book, the advanced training that is run is actually advanced individual training.

1625
02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000
That's what they call advanced individual training, which is hey, you're going to learn to be a sniper.

1626
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
You're going to learn to be a parachute rigger. You're going to learn to be a medic.

1627
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Those things are advanced training is what they call it.

1628
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000
The simplest way to explain what I did is I just call it advanced training.

1629
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
There's a seal that would be sitting in the audience go you didn't run advanced training.

1630
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Like no, I ran advanced collective platoon training.

1631
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So it's simple way to put it is to say advanced training even though there's a technical.

1632
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:48.000
There's a command called advanced training. It's ATC advanced training command and they teach dive supervisor.

1633
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Got ATC radio men. They teach individual skills.

1634
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
But it's what I taught was the advanced.

1635
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000
And usually what I actually call it is advanced tactical training because that's what it was.

1636
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
And that's what it still is. It's advanced tactical training.

1637
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
How do you? And that's the unit.

1638
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Collectivate. You didn't level training.

1639
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:14.000
And actually now that you say it, what I actually taught is called ULT unit level training on it.

1640
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:24.000
How much just hearing you say that how much has buds evolved and changed what they did compared to what you did and how much that evolved.

1641
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Yeah, unit level training evolves all the time.

1642
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
All the time, right?

1643
02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000
But it is a, it buds is what buds is.

1644
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And you can, you know, there's something, if, if somebody that went through buds in 1964 went and watched buds right now, they would go,

1645
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Oh, yeah, we just, oh, yeah, they'd get a lot of reminders.

1646
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.000
If they came and watched a seal, Patu and going through urban warfare training, they'd be like,

1647
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Damn. They'd say, damn. Now, the land war first stuff has been,

1648
02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:06.000
it's, it's really been very similar. All the, no, I can't even say that because we have the, the, the laser tag system.

1649
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
We got all the, they would do pyro and stuff, but we, the laser tag system and the paintball and stuff would just,

1650
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I was around when paintball started to come out in the seal teams and it, and it changed everything for us.

1651
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000
It changed everything for us because, unfortunately, most of the Vietnam guys were gone.

1652
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And so, all of a sudden, we started doing wrote things, wrote things, meaning, here's the problem.

1653
02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Here's the solution. And that's not what a learning organization does.

1654
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000
They don't do wrote things. No, they don't do wrote things, but hey, if you get contacted from this position in your patrol,

1655
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.000
here's the wrote answer to that, do that thing.

1656
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000
And what happens is the enemy that you're going against is paper targets, they don't move and they don't shoot back.

1657
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.000
They don't maneuver and they don't shoot back. Well, guess what? That's actually what combat is.

1658
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Combat is fire maneuver. And now you're going against an enemy that doesn't maneuver or shoot back.

1659
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
It doesn't cover move, doesn't fire move, doesn't do anything.

1660
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:09.000
So it's, it's, it's not that it's worthless because you will learn what the mechanics of movement are.

1661
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Yeah, yeah. But, and, and we used to do this to we would do no fire drills where hey, you're going to get contacted from a bunch of different places,

1662
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
but you're not shooting or we use blanks, we use Dits gear, did you ever use Dits gear?

1663
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Oh, no, it's not Dits gear. What's a miles gear?

1664
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Yeah, yeah. So Dits was like the modern for us in the sealed team. Dits was the modern version of miles gear.

1665
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Miles gear was kind of, it had a lot of, it had a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of issues with miles gear.

1666
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
The old miles gear that we had in the 80s and 90s.

1667
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000
It wasn't, you know, it didn't work really well and it was just, it wasn't great.

1668
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:52.000
And you coupled that with a bad attitude, which is, here's something I heard.

1669
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000
The thing that was, was, it's going to give you training scars.

1670
02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Like they would say that about paintball. They'd say, hey, if you're using paintball guns, you're going to get training scars.

1671
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Meaning, I'm going to forget how to load my real weapon because I'm used to reloading a paintball gun.

1672
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:20.000
And so now when the moment hits, I'm fumbling around, looking for a hopper to put my more paintball in.

1673
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
We can't do it because of that. And what that essentially does, unfortunately, throws the baby out with the bathwater.

1674
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Because the training scars that you get from only fighting against paper targets are worse than the training scars you get from having to use a different weapon

1675
02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:50.000
to run these scenarios. So to go back to your point and I see where you're going with this, the basic level training of individuals has advanced and evolved a lot less than the unit level training,

1676
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000
where we were constantly adapting from what was happening on the battlefield.

1677
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Was that similar for you guys? I mean, if someone went through flight school right now, they would look very similar to World War II flight school.

1678
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:09.000
That thing is not a, and it was just this idea of what a learning organization was. It's the organization has to learn.

1679
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And look, and I'm sure it's true for buzz. You've described it, but you know, OCS primary flight training, they're a very specific function.

1680
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000
But that function is not to teach war fighting.

1681
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:28.000
And so the evolution of those organizations really isn't that dramatic. It doesn't change very much because it's teaching these fundamental skills that are absolutely required.

1682
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000
But they're not the skills that you would utilize in the only skills you'd utilize for war fighting.

1683
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:44.000
I just think this point is a leader when you read that idea about learning organization is that a learning organization evolves in adapts and changes and right back to what you started with was my story at Topkin,

1684
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:54.000
which was you actually need to be out in front of that and leading your organization. So your organization is designed to learn, the organism that you're a part of learns.

1685
02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:04.000
And when you start in the military like OCS or boot camp or even a little bit TBS, I bet if I went back to OCS right now, I'd take that.

1686
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Yeah, that's about right. I see guys marching on the grinder. I see guys ripping their their bed sheets off their racks and throwing their matches on the floor. I see people yelling and screaming and that's probably looks much closer.

1687
02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I went back to if I went to air wing training at Topkin up at Fowler now, like damn you guys are up here. I guarantee you I'd say you guys have up your game a lot just because I've been out of it for long enough because that is a learning organization.

1688
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000
That's really I think the goal and I think again the parallels are pretty obvious in how clear that is.

1689
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And it's not to imply that those basics are an important they're critical.

1690
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:47.000
But and they mentioned that here just a little bit ago they're saying look what Marines do is get brilliant at the basics and when I was running trade at.

1691
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I actually changed the terminology that we used to describe basic I ads.

1692
02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I changed it from basic to fundamental because it's truth because guys we think well I'm not going to do the basics.

1693
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:11.000
But I think that's a fundamental fundamental fundamental. This is what it actually all boils down to these things these fundamental things and you know what.

1694
02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.000
There there have been changes but guess what's never changed cover move.

1695
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Keep the things simple prioritize the actual decentralized map those things have not changed.

1696
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
And I don't foresee them trade change.

1697
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Conclusion.

1698
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Strong leaders are also teachers and mentors every Marine is a current or future leader and therefore leads by example to seek learning opportunities for themselves and other Marines.

1699
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:56.000
All Marines, especially those in positions of leadership should strive to remain humble so they are ready and willing to learn from anyone at any time in any place.

1700
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Learning is an institutional priority and a professional expectation for all Marines.

1701
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Continuous, disciplined and progressive learning is necessary for war fighting readiness.

1702
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Learning is the foundation for all that Marines do.

1703
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.000
It is the key, a naibler for all war fighting functions.

1704
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And our purpose as the nation's naval expeditionary force in readiness.

1705
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Marines learn to quickly recognize and understand important information.

1706
02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Adapt, make sound decisions and act.

1707
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Which is especially important in the fog and friction of war.

1708
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.000
All Marines must understand that continuous learning is a priority.

1709
02:24:44.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And key to alreadyness as the nation's first line of defense always being ready to be the first to fight.

1710
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:11.000
And that's the last line of that document aside from a giant bibliography of all the different documents that they cite in there.

1711
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Many of which are actually other Marine Corps, which would seem like all that's incestuous.

1712
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.000
If those original pubs weren't so freaking solid.

1713
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.000
But that idea that learning is the foundation for all that Marines doing.

1714
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
It's the key in naibler.

1715
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000
The key in naibler to be able to collect, absorb and understand information.

1716
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:45.000
And then use that information to make good decisions and execute is all based on learning.

1717
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And that obviously doesn't only apply to Marines.

1718
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
It applies to everybody.

1719
02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000
And I'll tell you, I think we've had this, how long have we been, how long did I,

1720
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.000
what is this better than about a month cycle of us with this document? It's been about a month.

1721
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:15.000
I have been paying attention and have realized what, a better understanding of what,

1722
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
I haven't realized fully what it is, but I have a better understanding of learning.

1723
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And that I have been learning.

1724
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And more important, what difference it makes when you are proactively learning.

1725
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:40.000
When you are actually engaging, you're, you're putting pressure on your brain to proactively learn.

1726
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Makes a huge difference.

1727
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Learning because you're experiencing something or learning because you are being taught, like think of those two things.

1728
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Learning because you're experiencing it and learning because you're being taught, that's one level of learning.

1729
02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:07.000
But when you learn because you are actively engaging your brain and processing information and making it part of your usable knowledge.

1730
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Making it part of your usable knowledge.

1731
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Hey, I'm not just taking this fact, then storing it in there and not being able to take it out and recollect it.

1732
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Not only recollect it because who cares about recollecting it, but taking it to apply it to a problem and solve a problem.

1733
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Or use it, look, what are the chances that you come up with a problem that fits this thing that you learned and it's an exact fit.

1734
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000
No, you got to take six different little elements that you've learned actively learn.

1735
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000
You've engaged your brain and you apply a little piece there and a little piece over there.

1736
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000
And then you have that knowledge and you use it and you apply it.

1737
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
And that is the deal.

1738
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
That is the game changer.

1739
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And that is learning.

1740
02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:03.000
We're pretty fired up about learning over here on my side.

1741
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Echo Charles.

1742
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, then you make a good point with like, are you say usable, usable knowledge?

1743
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Is it where? It's a whole different thing. So that's weird because okay, so you don't remember when you're in school.

1744
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
I don't know.

1745
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Think, bro, were you a good student?

1746
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I was okay.

1747
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
You seem like you're like, you do a good student.

1748
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
As opposed to just say, no, I was, I was not a trouble maker.

1749
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I was quiet.

1750
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I did well in school.

1751
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I did not work very hard.

1752
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
So I wasn't like a studious guy.

1753
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I didn't like try hard in school.

1754
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Right, right.

1755
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Okay, so for like a better way of putting maybe just happen to get good grades kind of thing, give me kind of who you are.

1756
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
You could say that, I guess.

1757
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Sure.

1758
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I'll say that, but I will also say, juggle what were you good student in high school?

1759
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Yeah, no.

1760
02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Okay, so a lot of it seemed like in school in a learning should be fun, which you said by the way today.

1761
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Learning should be fun, right? I've heard that before.

1762
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Yeah, I'm like, James Damon actually.

1763
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I like it. I, yeah, as an adult, I think we can realize that a little bit more especially when we're in to learning.

1764
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
But you know, how like when you're in school, they're like, you're learning should be fun.

1765
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000
You're like, well, I'm doing it wrong because this is super boring.

1766
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
You know, like playing at the park is fun.

1767
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000
The slides fun.

1768
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Recess is fun.

1769
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Lunchtime fun.

1770
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Learning part, not so much. Pretty boring.

1771
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000
And this is what I think is this is why I think because it's not usable knowledge in your brain.

1772
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000
It is long term for sure, but you don't, you don't feel it.

1773
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I'm going to let Jaco talk because I actually am not. I'm going to say, though, because it might be kind of what we're thinking.

1774
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I just said, I had fun reading this. I had fun reading this book, this pop.

1775
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I had fun doing it, which is kind of crazy to think about because the first time I did it was just purely a chore.

1776
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I actually think learning is fun.

1777
02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000
So I do stuff with my kids. I got a six year old boy.

1778
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Like we are doing things now. He's able to do things with his hands and built up.

1779
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And he's learning things and he's having fun doing it.

1780
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:11.000
It's what is the problem is that the inability to make the connection that everything they're learning,

1781
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
even the ones that feel like a chore.

1782
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:20.000
If I could somehow convince my kid, listen, buddy, I know it doesn't make sense right now,

1783
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000
but you will one day make the connection between this and other things.

1784
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
If I could, which I can't do because he's six, if I could help him make that connection,

1785
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000
he would be much happier learning things that don't make sense as why he's learning them.

1786
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
It's the inability to make the connection.

1787
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000
The thing of it is that you said something, I'm going to go like,

1788
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
since I cracked this thing open.

1789
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I said this to you a little while ago,

1790
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
hey dude, this is coming out. They're about to publish this thing.

1791
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Even in the last month, I am looking around and seeing things that I've been looking around and seeing in my entire life.

1792
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000
That's because I can make the connection between learning things and how it creates,

1793
02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:03.000
not just the usable knowledge, but how it makes my life better and helps me be better at what I do.

1794
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.000
If you could make that connection for your kids,

1795
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.000
and I think that's the hardest part for me is, hey, but we can't just all do the things that you're enjoying.

1796
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
We got to do some of these other things that are important,

1797
02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:19.000
but I promise you they'll have value and meaning, that's hard to cross that bridge and make that gap for a sexual old.

1798
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000
But I've never seen anybody who learned something, not enjoy learning it once they figured out what they're doing.

1799
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
You were so close.

1800
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
So close.

1801
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
So close.

1802
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000
It's taken my thunder away.

1803
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
You were so close.

1804
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
I'm glad I gave you the opportunity to attempt.

1805
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
You were dancing around it.

1806
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
You were dancing around it and tell me if I'm wrong.

1807
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Well, I was thinking of like, man, I'm going to start saying something.

1808
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
He's going to say, and every time I try to say something, he's going to say it.

1809
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Echo says, if you could say it like him, it'd be better.

1810
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000
So I almost, I should have just followed my instinct, which is the same.

1811
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
You were dancing around what I was thinking.

1812
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Okay.

1813
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Which is this.

1814
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
You're saying, hey, you've got this thing and you can't make a connection in the future.

1815
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I'm going to take that one step further.

1816
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Imagine this.

1817
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Which I thought you were going to say is the key phrase.

1818
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
And then I thought you were going to say is the key phrase.

1819
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000
The application of knowledge actually being able to use it is where that connection gets made.

1820
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:22.000
So when you teach your son how to do something that he can apply immediately, that's fun.

1821
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Imagine if in Gjitsu what you had to do was do an armlock on a, on a, what is it?

1822
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
A grappling dummy.

1823
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
That's what your lessons were.

1824
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Would that be fun, right?

1825
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Marginal.

1826
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Okay.

1827
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
This did you not want to give me a solid answer.

1828
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
What's more fun?

1829
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Are I'm locking a grappling dummy or armlocking a training partner?

1830
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Let me ask you this.

1831
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000
How many armlocks have you done on a grappling dummy?

1832
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
One.

1833
02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Okay.

1834
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
How many armlocks have you done on training partners?

1835
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000
One million.

1836
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Exactly.

1837
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
So this, what, what you said Dave told me accurately.

1838
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:05.000
And I think where that connection actually gets made is when you are, have the,

1839
02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000
have the opportunity to apply that knowledge.

1840
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000
So if you teach your kids something and all of a sudden they go to the store and you go,

1841
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:22.000
hey, it's 78 cents, you know, get out the coins and the kid gets to take out three

1842
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000
quarters and three pennies and put them on the table and he applied that and you give them a nod.

1843
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Right.

1844
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Right.

1845
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Boom.

1846
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Yeah.

1847
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
The cashier goes, I mean, I'll thank you, son.

1848
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:38.000
So as much as we can if we can teach people something.

1849
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000
And then we find an avenue for them to actually apply that knowledge and who knows.

1850
02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Maybe this could, maybe the, the goal is to actually teach people and stages where you're teaching them things that they can actually apply.

1851
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Like if you can set it up that way that you're not trying to teach them advanced physics before,

1852
02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
but when there's no application for it, but then when they get to a point where you can start to say, hey,

1853
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
you want to check out, you want to know what the tide's going to do.

1854
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000
We can actually figure that out from from from astrophysics.

1855
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
We can actually figure that out.

1856
02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Here's what it is and here's how it works.

1857
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.000
And then people say, so.

1858
02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Yeah, application knowledge.

1859
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000
What do you think Dave?

1860
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Yeah, do totally.

1861
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:28.000
And the piece that I still am grappling with, the larger connection and, and I wish I could say it more clearly is.

1862
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
The piece that I'm struggling with and I think most people struggle with is.

1863
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000
What you're learning doesn't have to be applied in that same way, meaning.

1864
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
So hey, you learn it.

1865
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Let me teach a kid out of count money and then he gets a count money.

1866
02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:49.000
But if I were to tell you that you could be better at arm locking your opponent by reading the Marine Corps pub on strategy.

1867
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Because there's something that makes you think and see differently and some people don't want to read that stupid book because it has nothing to do with what they want to do.

1868
02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Actually, it does.

1869
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000
And if you can make that connection of this thing that seems totally irrelevant to your world, I don't like math.

1870
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
I'm never going to go be a math teacher.

1871
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
My daughter will say, I'm not good at math and I'm never going to go be whatever.

1872
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.000
There's a connection there to every other thing that you're doing.

1873
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
And that's a gap that's hard to bridge.

1874
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.000
It's not that that you're going to go, but you don't have to become a mathematician for math to be important in your life.

1875
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I'm going to stop there because I want to read it to say.

1876
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
But that's the gap that I'm talking about.

1877
02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
That's that's the original idea of the thread, right?

1878
02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
The original idea of the thread is like all these things are connected.

1879
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:38.000
And if you realize that they're connected, then you'll understand them better and the better you understand this scientist from 1820.

1880
02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Yeah.

1881
02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.000
The better you'll be able to relate to this artist in 1904.

1882
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Like those things are real.

1883
02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And the mind, the brain is a muscle that the more you use it, the more you utilize it, the better you can respond.

1884
02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And so yeah, I think you're actually absolutely right.

1885
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.000
That's when when and it was kind of stuck in the sick year old brain, right?

1886
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Because it's really hard to explain to a six year old, hey, this math that you're learning is going to help you give you a greater capability to win in a soccer game, right?

1887
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Like that, even though we all know it's actually true because you're sharper, you're smarter than you have the million reasons.

1888
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:34.000
So finding it, finding the application of it and when you recognize that application, and I think that's where I've been very, very lucky because at some point, again, that's some point.

1889
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I said, I can take what I learned in GJitsu and I can apply it to combat and I can apply it to leadership.

1890
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
And by the way, I can take something that I learned in leadership and I can apply it to GJitsu.

1891
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:49.000
And all the way across those, those, those modalities.

1892
02:36:49.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And by the way, those modalities, as soon as you step into some other modality, if you have the open mind, you see the application again and you see it again and you see it again.

1893
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:12.000
And we do this all the time at Slam Front, we're working with a company that we've never worked with this company before and you take a look at what they're doing, how they're doing it and you can apply the principles that we know.

1894
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And if you don't understand that, it, look, you got to take this little piece of this, this principle, this little piece and you put them in place and look, we get people at Slam Front clients that they've read the book thousand times.

1895
02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
They've listened to every single podcast.

1896
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:33.000
And as soon as you roll in and you start talking about it, they don't act quite have the skill yet of maybe how to apply it.

1897
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:41.000
And as soon as they see how it applies, all of a sudden they're mind expands and you go back three months later.

1898
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
And now they don't need, they don't need us anymore.

1899
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
They don't need national and foreign anymore.

1900
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000
They've figured out the application process and that's where they go next level.

1901
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Yeah, totally.

1902
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Speaking of learning.

1903
02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Echo Charles.

1904
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Closing the knowledge gaps.

1905
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Yes, speaking of closing the knowledge gaps.

1906
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Don't hide them.

1907
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Hide knowledge gap.

1908
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.000
You know why I think it's fun as an adult, I think more.

1909
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
So like when you're young at that and maybe this has to do with part of the brain.

1910
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
I don't know.

1911
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I don't know if I'm what I hear it does.

1912
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000
When you're young, everything is short term, everything.

1913
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000
True.

1914
02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Like the long term, the brain has a hard time to comprehend that.

1915
02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.000
So like you'll get students, like young students or whatever, who get really good grades,

1916
02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000
but that tends to be because their goal is to get good grades.

1917
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
It's not to like learn math so I can apply it to life necessarily.

1918
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Maybe that's what they're told.

1919
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Maybe maybe not, but as far as they're actual like desire to learn the math, it's like to get good grades.

1920
02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Try.

1921
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000
You're return.

1922
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Okay, so I taught my three-year-old how to choose a slingshot.

1923
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000
So I should have slingshot.

1924
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So I should have slingshot.

1925
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000
You watch a three-year-old boy, by the way, you know, probably girl too, but shoot a slingshot

1926
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000
at a bottle in front of a three-year-old.

1927
02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Thinking of thinking it's the most awesome thing in the world.

1928
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
And they say, oh yeah, you try.

1929
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
He doesn't know how.

1930
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
He doesn't know how to put the thing in. He gets all mad at whatever.

1931
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I teach him. He's focused on that thing like man, this is I'm going to learn the world's

1932
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
solutions.

1933
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.000
This is the best thing in my life and I need to learn this.

1934
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Try teaching him how to like memorize the alphabet.

1935
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000
He'll be like, well listen to you, but I'm not into this right now, you know.

1936
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
It's just night and day, you know.

1937
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Or try to do a puzzle with a kid.

1938
02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Here, just looking for that one piece that fits and when it fits, it's like cool,

1939
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
but meanwhile, as an adult, you're like cool, that is cool.

1940
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
That's a good incremental progress that we're making, but it's really cool when this whole

1941
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000
corner is developed and then this whole corner is the end then you put them all together and

1942
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000
boom the big puzzle.

1943
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000
It seems same.

1944
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
It's like a bigger picture kind of thing.

1945
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Anyway, that's why I think, and then not to mention when you're in an adult,

1946
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.000
what you're learning tends to be something you chose to learn.

1947
02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.000
And that's already you're just already going on that path of fulfilling like little

1948
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
gaps in your knowledge that you need to be filled.

1949
02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000
So like actionable knowledge kind of thing.

1950
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000
It's already going to be set up like that just by the very nature of you choosing what to learn.

1951
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000
See what I'm seeing.

1952
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Yeah, that's why it's important for parents, teachers, human beings to try and get the kids to recognize

1953
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000
what that threat, that that threat dies, everything together, the long because if we're learning

1954
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000
for short term, we're learning for short term and it's hard to see where it all ties into.

1955
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Yeah, with that.

1956
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000
So it's beginning long term short term learning.

1957
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
What do you got for us echo Charles?

1958
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.000
If you have, I'm going to go with the knowledge gap situation that really,

1959
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
because that's a big one.

1960
02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Hiding knowledge gap or closing.

1961
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Oh, yeah, closing.

1962
02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
It's closing in there for closing.

1963
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Close.

1964
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Yes.

1965
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000
So, it's facing it.

1966
02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Let's face it.

1967
02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I don't need to learn how to fight, right?

1968
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Because I don't fight.

1969
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Yeah.

1970
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Big.

1971
02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000
If that knowledge gap is exposed in the real world, you can have a problem.

1972
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
We are going to have a problem.

1973
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000
So let's close that knowledge gap.

1974
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
We'll take you to.

1975
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
When we take you to what do we need?

1976
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Do you do training?

1977
02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Gear.

1978
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Gear.

1979
02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.000
If you do not get, we're actually going to do it.

1980
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Okay.

1981
02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000
So we're getting all this stuff.

1982
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
There's more stuff by the way.

1983
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Or domain.com.

1984
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000
That's where you can get.

1985
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000
You can use best key school world.

1986
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.000
American made.

1987
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000
100%.

1988
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Are we back making jeans?

1989
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Yeah.

1990
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
We are making jeans.

1991
02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
We are back in the game.

1992
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Jeans are being made.

1993
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
You can order them.

1994
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000
And you will get them.

1995
02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000
We have.

1996
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
We're making.

1997
02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
So if you don't know, we started making masks.

1998
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Face coverings actually because we don't want people to get confused and think that this is an end ninety five masks.

1999
02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000
They're not.

2000
02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.000
But there's recommendations from all kinds of people.

2001
02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Including law enforcement that will.

2002
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Find you here in the state of California if you're not wearing a mask.

2003
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Yes.

2004
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Is that under certain circumstances?

2005
02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.000
You're outside.

2006
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Started May 1st.

2007
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.000
No kidding.

2008
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Yeah.

2009
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
So anyways, at origin, we started making masks.

2010
02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
So that people face coverings.

2011
02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
So if you want to get those.

2012
02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Go to origin main.com.

2013
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
You can also get a bunch of other clothes.

2014
02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Including jeans.

2015
02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Yes.

2016
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000
You can also get.

2017
02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Let's say you're in lockdown at your house.

2018
02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yes.

2019
02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
You didn't have a gym.

2020
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000
No gym.

2021
02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Your gym is shut down because of COVID-19.

2022
02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Now you have no way it's no gym.

2023
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
What are you going to do?

2024
02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Well, you want to work out.

2025
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000
You want to train.

2026
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Guess what you can get from origin main.

2027
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Two items right now.

2028
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
One of them is a.

2029
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Plyo box, right?

2030
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
You want to get your jump on.

2031
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
And there's all kinds of things you can do with the Plyo box.

2032
02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
You don't what I do with a Plyo box.

2033
02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Push up.

2034
02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Yeah, push ups.

2035
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Yes, jump.

2036
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Yeah, all that stuff.

2037
02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
You don't have to stretch oddly enough.

2038
02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000
It's one of those things.

2039
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000
You use it to get yourself in positions that force you to stretch.

2040
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000
And I am not a good stretcher.

2041
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.000
And then we also have something known as the bird.

2042
02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000
The bird, which is A.

2043
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
What would you say it is?

2044
02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
A leather kettlebell.

2045
02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
It's a leather kettlebell.

2046
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:31.000
So it shows up to your house with no weight.

2047
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
And then you can fill it with whatever you want to fill it with.

2048
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
My recommendation actually pennies.

2049
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Go to your bank.

2050
02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Go to your bank and get 50 to $75 worth of pennies.

2051
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Yeah.

2052
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Load them into the burden.

2053
02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So a stitch it up.

2054
02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Not stitch it, but you tie it up.

2055
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
It's actually laces.

2056
02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
And then you have.

2057
02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:58.000
You got about a 30 to 40 pound kettlebell depending on how much you fill it up.

2058
02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Yeah, dang. That's a good idea.

2059
02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Pennis are heavy men.

2060
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Pennis are heavy.

2061
02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
And they're readily available.

2062
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
They have met the bank.

2063
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
There's going to be a run on pennies in America.

2064
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
They're going to go up the county.

2065
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
You know, they're going out.

2066
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.000
They're phasing out pennies.

2067
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000
They work.

2068
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Do they even have them at the bank?

2069
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yes.

2070
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
They do.

2071
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Yes, they do.

2072
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:21.000
I heard like five years ago that they're straight up phasing pennies out of the whole game.

2073
02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000
The cool thing 40 pounds might seem like for a kettlebell.

2074
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000
If you've never used a kettlebell before or you don't work out, you're going to be surprised.

2075
02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
40 pounds is heavy is more than you're going to have to go lighter than that.

2076
02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000
But dealing with the burden because it's.

2077
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Pliable.

2078
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000
It's actually harder to you.

2079
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
It's harder to work with in a kettlebell.

2080
02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000
So like you know a kettlebell is harder to work with a barbell because it's odd shape.

2081
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Yeah.

2082
02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Whatever.

2083
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000
This is one step even harder.

2084
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Yeah.

2085
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.000
So you can get really kind of savage workouts just with.

2086
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
The burden.

2087
02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Yeah.

2088
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Yeah, that makes sense because it's like, you know, that's the whole thing with like,

2089
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
like sandbags.

2090
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Yeah.

2091
02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
You know that awkward.

2092
02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Yeah.

2093
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
The awkward is like working more muscle.

2094
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Do you have a burden?

2095
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
No.

2096
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Oh, dang.

2097
02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Your relationships must not be a very good right now over an origin.

2098
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Yeah.

2099
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Well, it's a hot commodity.

2100
02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
That thing is good.

2101
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Yeah.

2102
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Well, we sold out immediately, but we got more leather.

2103
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
So we're back in the game.

2104
02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Making a happen with burdens.

2105
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Yes.

2106
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.000
More burdens for the world.

2107
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Yeah.

2108
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000
That was good.

2109
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Carry your burden.

2110
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Well, also boots are we're back doing the boots thing.

2111
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Do you have boots ready to know?

2112
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
No boots either.

2113
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
No boots.

2114
02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Very bad relationships.

2115
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Either that or they know me really well.

2116
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.000
You're right.

2117
02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.000
You're right.

2118
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.000
You're right.

2119
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Yeah.

2120
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Makes sense.

2121
02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Yeah.

2122
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Well, yeah.

2123
02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
You won't wear boots like this around.

2124
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000
No.

2125
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:54.000
I don't wear boots just around.

2126
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.000
But when I go on the road, I only wear boots.

2127
02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Yeah.

2128
02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Cool.

2129
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Makes sense.

2130
02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Everything at origami.com also supplements.

2131
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.000
If you are not keeping your joints in order, you're not going to be happy.

2132
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Big picture.

2133
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Because after a while, they jam up.

2134
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Trust me.

2135
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
So yes.

2136
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Joint warfare from Jocco.

2137
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Joint warfare.

2138
02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000
A super krill oil.

2139
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Also, we have the discipline.

2140
02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Keep your mind in the game.

2141
02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
You're brain in the game.

2142
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Dave Burke, super excited about the discipline.

2143
02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Pretty much daily.

2144
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Not pretty much.

2145
02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000
It's actual daily.

2146
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
It's actual daily.

2147
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Yeah.

2148
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Yeah.

2149
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Yeah.

2150
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000
We spun up some more cold war, too.

2151
02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000
So I was, yeah.

2152
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:44.000
If you need that little immune system hitter, you can jump on the cold war.

2153
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:53.16
war and get some of that. The cans of Disciplingo ready to drink and there's a new flavor

2154
02:46:53.16 --> 02:46:57.20
that will be coming out. Actually there's a couple new flavors that will be coming out. One

2155
02:46:57.20 --> 02:47:08.52
of them is called Sour Apple Sniper. The JPDNL signature and then also we will be announcing

2156
02:47:08.52 --> 02:47:15.32
afterburner Orange. The Dave Burke signature models. And then echo Charles we don't

2157
02:47:15.32 --> 02:47:20.76
have a name. We don't even have a flavor yet. But I sensed in the room today when we started

2158
02:47:20.76 --> 02:47:26.84
talking about afterburner Orange. Let's just say some of us weren't as excited and maybe

2159
02:47:26.84 --> 02:47:35.88
thought that maybe they should have their own talk about rather setting in tune. I think

2160
02:47:35.88 --> 02:47:47.68
you need your own flavor. Well thanks. But yes, the Sour Apple Sniper. Dude, it is so good.

2161
02:47:47.68 --> 02:47:53.48
I did my first two samples of the afterburner Orange. Right now that Sour Apple Sniper

2162
02:47:53.48 --> 02:47:59.68
Apple, they have that dial that thing in. That thing was good. Yeah, it'll take

2163
02:47:59.68 --> 02:48:06.48
some iterations. Yeah, I'm done two. I've done two trials so far. Afterburner Orange. Yeah, I got the first two.

2164
02:48:06.48 --> 02:48:10.80
Got the family. Everybody got in on it. Try it. Yeah. It's just going to take. It takes

2165
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:17.20
iterations. Okay. Get it there. The, I mean for the first mole. For mint mole, I went through

2166
02:48:17.20 --> 02:48:21.28
10 iterations. Try it again. Try it again. Try it again. And then finally I was like, yep, there it

2167
02:48:21.28 --> 02:48:26.40
is. So all that good stuff. Warrior Kid Mulk. Dockle White T. Man, I made a dockle

2168
02:48:26.40 --> 02:48:32.16
way to the other day like from the T bags. That is so legit. And all this stuff is available

2169
02:48:32.16 --> 02:48:35.92
at the Vitaminshopp if the Vitaminshopp is open in your area right now. So it's where I'll

2170
02:48:35.92 --> 02:48:45.68
mock down. You can check it all out there. Origin main.com Origin main M.A. I. N. E. Origin

2171
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:53.76
main. Dot com for any of this gear. And it does. Sapparch. Yes. Does support. Whole game. The whole

2172
02:48:53.76 --> 02:49:03.68
system. Really. Also, jocco as a store and it's called jocco store. So super original. Yes. We go to

2173
02:49:03.68 --> 02:49:09.60
joccostore.com and you can get, you know, what do you want to merge? That was the kid how

2174
02:49:09.60 --> 02:49:15.28
the kid say it. And the merch. Yeah. And the last T shirts, hoodies, more rash guards,

2175
02:49:15.76 --> 02:49:20.000
beanies, some women stuff on their tank tops and whatnot. You know, just plaincos freedom.

2176
02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:29.12
You know, the whole, uh, how should I say? As far as representation goes, you will be representing

2177
02:49:29.12 --> 02:49:35.04
the path. We'll say that. I got a good quarantine shirt on there too. If you want to represent

2178
02:49:35.04 --> 02:49:40.88
in lockdown, you're still putting in the work. You're still doing your, uh, decline pushups on the

2179
02:49:40.88 --> 02:49:46.56
plyo box. You're carrying the burden. You seem saying anyone will represent. We got a good

2180
02:49:46.56 --> 02:49:52.000
quarantine shirt free. Good. Oh, God, women's tank top two tank tops to buy the way anyway.

2181
02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.72
Jocco store.com. Good stuff. I'll just leave that out there for you. Yeah. It's good, man.

2182
02:49:58.64 --> 02:50:05.68
Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't yet. Leave a review. So we can read it. Hopefully it's

2183
02:50:05.68 --> 02:50:10.88
funny. Hopefully it's impactful. Also, got some other podcasts. Got a podcast called the thread.

2184
02:50:10.88 --> 02:50:18.24
The episodes are out there on YouTube. It's a different, what does it podcast feed?

2185
02:50:21.92 --> 02:50:26.08
What is it called? Yeah, it is called the feed. Yeah, that's true. So there's a, there's a different

2186
02:50:26.08 --> 02:50:31.28
feed for the thread. There's a different feed for grounded. So the thread is about, well, it's about

2187
02:50:31.28 --> 02:50:37.28
we're just talking about thread of things, how things connect together in the world. And we myself

2188
02:50:37.28 --> 02:50:45.60
a derocuper of Margar made. I haven't been doing that podcast. It's been, it's been wild to be honest.

2189
02:50:45.60 --> 02:50:50.08
With his bringing things up in my mind, we're making, we remember things. One of the coolest things

2190
02:50:50.08 --> 02:50:56.000
that he made me remember was this conversation with contractors. I'm in Baghdad. It's 2003, 2004,

2191
02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.28
and there's contractors that show up in Baghdad. These guys are black water guys or whatever triple

2192
02:51:01.28 --> 02:51:10.48
canopy guys. And these guys come in to our compound. And they just kind of arrived in country.

2193
02:51:10.48 --> 02:51:15.04
And a couple of reformer seals, you know, probably in the 90s, no combat experience. And they're

2194
02:51:15.04 --> 02:51:18.32
talking to us. And you know, we're looking at their gear and we're kind of giving them a heads up.

2195
02:51:18.32 --> 02:51:26.88
And that deral, because he's good like this, we were asking the guys, because they were

2196
02:51:26.88 --> 02:51:35.04
there about to go to Follugia. And they were taking up armored, at Ford explorers with sounds,

2197
02:51:35.04 --> 02:51:41.36
badass. But the up armored Ford explorers were actually horrible. All they were was a regular

2198
02:51:41.36 --> 02:51:49.68
Ford explorer, two wheel drive, Ford explorer with like a little bulletproof glass mounted inside of

2199
02:51:49.68 --> 02:51:53.92
it. They didn't make any adjustments to the suspension. They didn't make any adjustments to the power.

2200
02:51:53.92 --> 02:51:58.88
It was just, they were junk. And so we're looking at these guys getting ready to go in Follugia.

2201
02:52:00.40 --> 02:52:05.36
And we're asking them, hey, do you guys have run flats? For your, okay, we're asking

2202
02:52:05.36 --> 02:52:08.000
to hate you have this, do you have this, do you have a radio, do you have this? And then it's like,

2203
02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.08
hey, do you have run flats for your, for your Ford explorers? And they're like, no. And and

2204
02:52:14.08 --> 02:52:22.64
deral named the podcast, you know, do you have run flats? And it's such a great name because that

2205
02:52:22.64 --> 02:52:27.60
really shows you where we were at. That was towards the end of my deployment. And these guys

2206
02:52:27.60 --> 02:52:33.12
are just showing up. And we knew how bad things could get and how quickly they could get bad.

2207
02:52:33.84 --> 02:52:37.76
And these guys who had just showed up had no idea what they were getting into. And

2208
02:52:38.72 --> 02:52:45.84
within a month, the contractors that got that got ambushed in Follugia and strong up on the, on the

2209
02:52:45.84 --> 02:52:53.44
bridge. Then we're there. So we go into all kinds of things like that type of story, like that type

2210
02:52:53.44 --> 02:52:57.36
of information, which I really haven't talked about in that podcast, the thread. And we're going to

2211
02:52:57.36 --> 02:53:03.04
where we got China coming up. We're going deep on China. And so we also have the ground in podcast,

2212
02:53:03.04 --> 02:53:08.08
which is about you, Jitsu. We have the warrior kid podcast, which is for warrior kids latest latest

2213
02:53:08.08 --> 02:53:12.88
episode. I think it's the latest episode. It's about Johnny Kim. Yeah. Johnny Kims on it.

2214
02:53:12.88 --> 02:53:21.68
Guest guests starring astronaut, doctor and seal. Johnny Kim. Warrior kid soap don't forget about that.

2215
02:53:22.24 --> 02:53:28.88
It's available on Jocquistore now. Is it are we there yet? Are we there yet? Yes. That was a massive

2216
02:53:28.88 --> 02:53:33.76
hesitation. Warrior kid soap gets some killer soap for yourself. And that way you, your family,

2217
02:53:33.76 --> 02:53:41.76
everyone you know can stay clean. Stay clean. Stay clean. Stay clean. Speaking of staying clean,

2218
02:53:41.76 --> 02:53:47.68
we have a YouTube channel. Very clean YouTube channel. Where? Actually, I'm not sure how clean that

2219
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:53.60
YouTube channel is. Why can't you just go in and do like you need to make channels within the channel?

2220
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:59.76
One that says, you know, whatever you call hype videos or whatever things you have. And

2221
02:53:59.76 --> 02:54:03.44
dance videos you should have enhanced videos. You should have excerpts. You should have the thread.

2222
02:54:03.44 --> 02:54:08.64
You should have ground it. You should have grounded all in separate channels. That's my humble opinion.

2223
02:54:08.64 --> 02:54:15.60
Yeah. You want a while go home and do it. Okay. All right. Taking action. Well, they are they're in playlists.

2224
02:54:15.60 --> 02:54:19.20
Right. So it's called playlists. So they're called. So you're done that already. I've done that,

2225
02:54:19.20 --> 02:54:25.12
but here's the thing. What you're talking about. Which I agree. Is it I've done that? Or is it here's the thing?

2226
02:54:25.12 --> 02:54:30.88
Which one of these two are we talking about? It's actually technically both. So that is done.

2227
02:54:30.88 --> 02:54:35.84
They're in playlists. So you can go to the playlists section. Then they'll be organized. But if you go to the

2228
02:54:35.84 --> 02:54:42.24
main YouTube, then there's a way to organize it where it displays your playlist with which is what I think

2229
02:54:42.24 --> 02:54:47.04
anyway that you're talking about. Right. Like channels within the channel. Yeah. So when you go to the main

2230
02:54:47.04 --> 02:54:53.04
page, it's like you can's in nonetheless. Yeah. It is done. So yes, they can be played in a row and order,

2231
02:54:53.04 --> 02:54:58.72
whatever. And you know, be not filtered out. But like if you just want to listen to the thread.

2232
02:54:58.72 --> 02:55:03.92
Right. And you just let them play. Boom. See what I say? Yeah. Got them all. Anyway,

2233
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.56
yes, we do have a YouTube channel. Jockpock. Yes, YouTube channel. Video version. Video. See what they

2234
02:55:08.56 --> 02:55:12.88
look like. See what we all look like. Whatever. Also excerpts on there. We got psychological warfare.

2235
02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.84
If you need a little psychological hitter to push you through a moment of weakness, you can check that out.

2236
02:55:19.84 --> 02:55:27.68
Wherever MP3. Our sold. Wherever MP3, I was going to say songs, but they're not songs.

2237
02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:33.36
Wherever MP3 audio is coming at you. Check it out. Psychological warfare is the name of that flip side

2239
02:55:41.92 --> 02:55:49.12
Books. We got some books. What book? How about the code? The evaluations. The protocol. Dave

2240
02:55:49.12 --> 02:55:56.72
Burke. How's it going? It's going pretty good. Are you happy with the product? I am. I've been

2241
02:55:56.72 --> 02:56:01.20
more happy with the interaction that the product has created. Yeah. Oh, I've been interaction

2242
02:56:01.20 --> 02:56:07.04
man. It is so awesome. It is a how many people got it and got either back on the path or

2243
02:56:07.04 --> 02:56:12.96
understood the path better. The interaction from that has been awesome. I'm stoked to be a part of that.

2244
02:56:12.96 --> 02:56:18.80
That is the that book is like this is another thing that it that it sort of does. And whether

2245
02:56:18.80 --> 02:56:23.36
is the surprising maybe maybe not. But it's like okay, so you read it right? You could refer to it

2246
02:56:23.36 --> 02:56:28.48
all this stuff. It's like a big part of it is just a reminder to just evaluate how good you're doing.

2247
02:56:28.48 --> 02:56:34.16
And really remember that you have you do have a goal. And if you don't then make a goal whatever.

2248
02:56:34.16 --> 02:56:37.92
So like this is what it'll do. Like if I'll work out, which is a normal thing. You know,

2249
02:56:37.92 --> 02:56:43.76
try to work out. But I'm mentally conscious of like okay, what kind of workout was that? Was that

2250
02:56:43.76 --> 02:56:49.28
a two? Was that a five? You know, and I'm kind of like at the end I have a straight up number done,

2251
02:56:49.28 --> 02:56:54.96
straight up. And then I'll share it with somebody just through up a four today, you know, whoever

2252
02:56:54.96 --> 02:56:58.64
you know, if they're sort of in the game as well. Like that's what it'll do, you know,

2253
02:56:58.64 --> 02:57:02.40
it's a little keep you on track man in that way. Dude without a doubt you start thinking about

2254
02:57:02.40 --> 02:57:07.36
things you've never thought about before. You know, also just being able to say I just need to

2255
02:57:07.36 --> 02:57:13.04
at least get a one over here. Just at least like hey, and you also look at some cookies and you

2256
02:57:13.04 --> 02:57:18.56
say no, I'm not going to go to zero. Oh, I'm not throwing a fan was telling me he had a little scenario

2257
02:57:18.56 --> 02:57:24.64
unfold and he was like, this could be a zero through the zero all the diet. I had a little

2258
02:57:24.64 --> 02:57:35.28
scenario yesterday just had a phryophe zero on on fuel in the intake. Yeah. What?

2259
02:57:35.28 --> 02:57:40.48
In a whole no worse way worse. Don't know. I'm never going to eat donuts. I don't know. I'm

2260
02:57:40.48 --> 02:57:44.48
never going to eat donuts. If you see me eating donuts, you can stab me in the face.

2261
02:57:45.28 --> 02:57:49.20
Because I just not going to do it. But just straight up American

2262
02:57:49.20 --> 02:57:58.000
chicken, bacon cheeseburger, which right we're already not good, but fries with it. That's just

2263
02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.72
no fat. That's just unsat. Yeah. That's just unsat at the end of the day that does what is that

2264
02:58:02.72 --> 02:58:08.56
that that amounts to a zero. Yeah. So that's I was actually I asked Laefals like maybe I should

2265
02:58:08.56 --> 02:58:13.84
put some kind of negative numbering like you this could actually take you time to bake out to

2266
02:58:13.84 --> 02:58:21.20
you. Right. You had bacon double cheeseburger. The camera over for the next day is diet. You're

2267
02:58:21.20 --> 02:58:24.72
carrying that with you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't get another point. On tomorrow's note. It should

2268
02:58:24.72 --> 02:58:33.44
be a negative. Even if I ate today, you know, a grass fed steak, you know, whatever and a salad,

2269
02:58:34.16 --> 02:58:38.88
I would still not even be able to dig out of the hole. French fries. I don't mean French

2270
02:58:38.88 --> 02:58:47.52
for come on. What's what would be a one as far as a meal goes? You think? I think she's done

2271
02:58:47.52 --> 02:58:54.40
no. I think I think a well, I don't know. Because look, if there's a potential for a five

2272
02:58:54.40 --> 02:58:58.48
a meal that's a five, a four or three, a two and a one. Well, first of all, it's a whole day, right?

2273
02:58:58.48 --> 02:59:00.32
It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day.

2274
02:59:00.32 --> 02:59:03.76
It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. You don't get up and have a

2275
02:59:03.76 --> 02:59:08.24
ideal breakfast and give yourself a five for diet for the day and call it good. You got to do the

2276
02:59:08.24 --> 02:59:13.68
whole day. If you're on a five for a diet, that diet is that consumption is tethered to other

2277
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:21.04
things that you're doing. You're up to my, you're going. A one is like, I didn't do anything bad,

2278
02:59:21.04 --> 02:59:24.88
but I didn't do anything like constructive either. I'm not like managing what I'm

2279
02:59:24.88 --> 02:59:31.36
taking. A one's like you ate to survive. You and you didn't do anything that took you

2280
02:59:31.36 --> 02:59:36.40
going backwards. But like, we're so French fries involved. If you were French fries in the day,

2281
02:59:36.40 --> 02:59:40.96
you're not getting a one. Okay. No one. Is this a one day? We'll say breakfast lunch dinner.

2282
02:59:40.96 --> 02:59:47.92
Keep it simple. Okay. Breakfast. We ate frosted mini wheat. No. It's getting

2283
02:59:47.92 --> 02:59:52.32
your artist. It's serious. I always talk about it. Frosted mini wheat. Yes.

2284
02:59:52.32 --> 02:59:57.52
It is right now. I would not shred it. I know. Brother. What no wheat. No whole wheat. That's

2285
02:59:57.52 --> 03:00:02.72
cereal. What about Grinthala? No. No. That's not nice. Hey, there. Here's the other thing.

2286
03:00:02.72 --> 03:00:07.84
We got to look at what is what is it that you've set up for yourself, right? Because some people,

2287
03:00:07.84 --> 03:00:12.48
if you're running a marathon, all of a sudden, you're going to need certain foods that you would not

2288
03:00:12.48 --> 03:00:17.04
need. Had you been trying to cut weight or had you been trying to gain weight, right?

2289
03:00:17.04 --> 03:00:21.60
Right. It's not depends. Listen. There's a thing here that's a large and we've had a lot of

2290
03:00:21.60 --> 03:00:26.40
questions about this. First of all, whoever's like, you mark yourself whenever you want. This is your

2291
03:00:26.40 --> 03:00:31.52
evaluation. If you're a habit, if you're, if you're someone who's spent the last 10 years and you

2292
03:00:31.52 --> 03:00:36.16
get up in the morning and your breakfast is donuts. That's just been your thing, donuts, and coffee,

2293
03:00:36.16 --> 03:00:41.20
and you get off the donut and coffee train and you get up and you have some sort of whole wheat

2294
03:00:41.20 --> 03:00:46.96
cereal thing to replace that. You're doing, you're improving. You're getting better. Now, is that a five?

2295
03:00:46.96 --> 03:00:51.84
No. That's not a five. It's not to like punish you for making one small mistake, but it's the

2296
03:00:51.84 --> 03:00:55.92
measurement of the things that you're doing. The biggest takeaway is what you said is, are you thinking

2297
03:00:55.92 --> 03:01:03.28
about this? Because if donuts as part of your diet, every, that's your, your zero for nutrition

2298
03:01:03.28 --> 03:01:07.52
in your life and you need to get on a path by which that is no longer part of your repertoire. And when

2299
03:01:07.52 --> 03:01:13.04
you don't do that, you got to count for that. You know what? Why even play around? I have the book right

2300
03:01:13.04 --> 03:01:17.76
here. Here's the score of one. For at the end of the day, you ate everything you're going to eat. Here's

2301
03:01:17.76 --> 03:01:24.08
the score of one. Food intake was effective to sustain health, but did not optimize nutrition or

2302
03:01:24.08 --> 03:01:32.40
participate in health enhancing program. So maybe you had some little granola like it sustained you,

2303
03:01:32.40 --> 03:01:39.04
but it did not optimize. Right. Yeah. It wasn't. You were recovering from the week's quarter.

2304
03:01:39.04 --> 03:01:44.16
Zero is did not eat properly and did not provide any nutritional benefit to perform critical daily

2305
03:01:44.16 --> 03:01:53.36
tasks. That's your donuts and a pizza. Right. You're just to gear in a zero. Yeah. Five consumed ideal

2306
03:01:54.64 --> 03:02:02.88
ideal food intake and maintained perfect adherence to diet or fasting. Got it. Yeah. Every calorie

2307
03:02:02.88 --> 03:02:09.84
was optimal. What? Every calorie was optimal and nothing was consumed that didn't contribute to health

2308
03:02:09.84 --> 03:02:15.28
or nutrition allowing for a sustained peak level of performance throughout the entire day.

2309
03:02:16.32 --> 03:02:20.72
No big deal. No big deal. I had an interesting situation to throw out to the crowd here.

2310
03:02:20.72 --> 03:02:26.80
Happening me out Saturday night. So normal day Saturday. We're out. It's good day.

2311
03:02:27.44 --> 03:02:32.48
Took my kids mountain biking. We had a good day. Came back at a good. I think I grilled. We had a normal

2312
03:02:32.48 --> 03:02:38.48
dinner and then we had a little adult situation at the neighbors. We went to the neighbor's house.

2313
03:02:38.48 --> 03:02:42.08
We did some social distancing hanging out. Everything was cool. They're all drinking. I don't drink.

2314
03:02:42.08 --> 03:02:46.64
I'm hanging out. It's all good. We had a good time. Get home just before midnight.

2315
03:02:48.72 --> 03:02:56.40
Feeling hungry Dave feeling so at literally the stroke of midnight. I am consuming strawberry

2316
03:02:56.40 --> 03:03:03.68
mock at midnight. Yeah. I'm good with that. Yeah. I'm totally. Yeah. My last meal was

2317
03:03:03.68 --> 03:03:09.68
late after I didn't need them. I should have just gotten a meal. But I was I wanted something that

2318
03:03:09.68 --> 03:03:14.40
tasted good so bad that I just. That's a good question right there though. One of the good things

2319
03:03:14.40 --> 03:03:18.64
about mock. You check it out. You might feel guilty because it tasted so good. But it actually

2320
03:03:18.64 --> 03:03:24.000
needs probably here. That's a good thing. It's not a good thing. Yeah. And the motive too.

2321
03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.24
Right. You weren't like, hey, I'm on this program. This mock needs to facilitate the program.

2322
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:32.48
You're like, hey, I need something too. It's good. There's the mock. So it's kind of a question.

2323
03:03:32.48 --> 03:03:38.08
Is that so what is that? It's not like a two. It has to be something because mock is good for you.

2324
03:03:38.08 --> 03:03:44.32
Are you if you're working out on any regular basis? Moke is good for you and it does support your

2325
03:03:44.32 --> 03:03:49.52
goals. 100%. It's good for you period. I don't even think this is a question actually. This is a positive.

2326
03:03:49.52 --> 03:03:53.76
Just a good deal. It's just a little guilt because it tastes so good. Yeah.

2327
03:03:53.76 --> 03:03:59.04
Leadership strategy and tactic. So the code you can get that one. It's up and running. We had a

2328
03:03:59.04 --> 03:04:04.16
little lag time. I apologize. I didn't realize that every single person was going to buy it.
