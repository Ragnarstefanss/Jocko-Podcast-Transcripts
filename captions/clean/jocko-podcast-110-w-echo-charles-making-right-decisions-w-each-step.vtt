00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Jocopodcast number 1-10.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
With echo-chirls and me, Jocobillic.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
All sciences have principles and rules.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
War has none.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The great captains who have written of it give us none.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Extreme cleverness is required to even understand them.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it is impossible to base any judgment on their relations of the historians.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For they only speak of war as their imaginations painted.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
As for the great captains who have written of it, they have attempted rather to be interesting than instructive.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Since the mechanics of war is dry and tedious.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Books dealing with it have small success and their merit will not be recognized except after the passage of time.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Those writing historically of war have better luck.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They are sought by all the curious and kept in the all libraries.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That is why we only have a confused idea of the discipline of the Greeks and Romans.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
War is a science covered with shadows in whose obscurity one cannot move within a shared step.

18
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Routine and prejudice the natural result of ignorance are its foundation and support.

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Nothing is so disgraceful as slavishness to custom.

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is both a result of ignorance and a proof of it.

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Shevelair Fullard supposes all men to be brave at all times and does not realize that the courage of the troops must be reborn daily.

22
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That nothing is so variable and that the true skill of a general consists of knowing how to guarantee it by his dispositions, his positions, and those traits of genius that characterize great captains.

23
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Perhaps he reserved of this immense, perhaps he reserved discussion of this immense subject and perhaps also it escaped him.

24
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Nevertheless, it is of all the elements of war, the one that is most necessary to study.

25
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The same troops who, if attacking would have been victorious, may be inevitably defeated in entrenchments.

26
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Few men have accounted for it in a reasonable manner for it lies in human hearts and one should search for it there.

27
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:53.000
No one has written of this matter which is of the most importance, the most learned and the most profound of the profession of war.

28
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And without a knowledge of the human heart, one is dependent upon the favor of fortune which sometimes is very inconstant.

29
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So those are some opening words from a book called Reverees on War by Maristisax.

30
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This guy is a character, Maristisax.

31
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You do a little research on him.

32
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Did you find out how much of a character he was?

33
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
No, not.

34
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
He was a serious character.

35
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
There's a couple things, there's a couple things even in that opening right there that I wasn't sure if I was going to cover this.

36
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And I was kind of like going back to it to see if it was something we should cover.

37
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But I just, when you get right here, all sciences have principles and rules, war has none.

38
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That's a true statement.

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And it's true that there's, you know, there's principles of warfare, but there's no actual rules.

40
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Like you can do whatever you want. I mean, you can say that you need a convention, but then you can just defy it and just, you know, you can do things that are completely opposed to it.

41
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So there's no rules. You should do whatever you want to win.

42
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Now you could lose your respect and you could act inhumane and that might cost you in the long run, but if war is war, there's no other thing like that.

43
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Right? There's no other thing like that. Do whatever you want.

44
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I guess if you had a, if you had like a street fight with no weapons and someone's going to do whatever they could to win, right?

45
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It's the same, it's, that's war.

46
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It's the same thing. Yeah, I'm sure.

47
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Yeah, when you do it like death is kind of the goal and the consequences at the same time like death.

48
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That's the end of the line. So yeah, anything goes essentially.

49
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Yeah.

50
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Yeah, nothing else is like that.

51
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then he says this, nothing is so disgraceful as slavishness to custom.

52
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That's a bold statement too.

53
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I agree.

55
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Disgraceful. He calls it. He talks about these prejudices that people have.

56
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I think you call them. What do you call them?

57
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Biasis, right? Cognitive biases. He talks about, he doesn't talk about that, but he talks about them.

58
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But this guy was a character. He lived from 1696 to 1750.

59
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He started off as a German soldier in the army of the Holy Roman Empire, which was like this bunch of territories in Europe that were banded together on the same day.

60
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
They were banded together under that name, and they were around for a long time from like the Middle Ages until the time of the Napoleonic Wars.

61
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, you know, the early 1800s.

62
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And he served also served in the Imperial Army, which was another kind of army that often fought alongside the army of the Holy Roman Empire.

63
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And he's funny, but the weird thing is, is he finished his career as the martial general of France.

64
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so he kind of, I guess you could say, kind of switch size, but he rose up through the ranks.

65
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Because his military career started at the age of 13 when he fought at the Battle of Malpukhe.

66
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I think that's how you say it.

67
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Which, and that that war, that battle right there was that was between the army of the Holy Roman Empire and France.

68
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So he was on both sides at certain points of his life.

69
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I think the whole time he was, it seems like from what I read about him, he was always kind of looking to go up the social structure.

70
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
You know, rise up in the social structure and become more a powerful person in the hierarchy of those times in the dominance hierarchy.

71
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So yeah, he started fighting at age 13, which by the way, that's just so cool.

72
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I don't, I'm sorry if you think I'm a bad person, but as far as I'm concerned, if I could join the military at 13, I would have been so stoked.

73
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Sorry, everyone that doesn't agree with that, that's just how I roll.

74
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm just telling the truth on that one.

75
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And actually as I look back on my life, if I could have done that would have been even better.

76
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I think they should allow people to join the military. They should have some like a youth core. You can go in and just get after it at a young age.

77
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But they think a 13 year old can't make that decision.

78
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And they're right. The 13 year old can't make that decision. So you'd have to have really benevolent people that were in charge of them and charge of these troops.

79
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And you also think that an 18 year old person can make a good decision.

80
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But that's not true because you got 18 people that are dumb or dirt.

81
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You can make bad decisions. And people will worry that you're going to get thoughts put into your head.

82
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Yeah, you are. You are. And guess what? If they're good thoughts right on, that's not a bad thing, right?

83
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Yeah, but I mean, you have to learn everything yourself. Is that the way the world works?

84
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You can't have good ideas put in your head. You can't get a little bit programmed.

85
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Yeah, you can't get programmed to be a better human being. Would you accept that program?

86
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Yeah, of course. Okay, I'm just checking.

87
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But as you're over there looking like because I'm a bad person because I'm trying to brainwash you know, because you're just saying.

88
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Like, we're better. Good and better. Like there's this universal good and better. You know, there is.

89
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
There is. I mean, there is. Okay. But it's so narrow.

90
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Because then we have Jordan B. Peterson on there. You can convert that. You can you can have a conversation with him about that.

91
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
How do you say that you don't know that there's universal good and you've universal.

92
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
No, no, no, I'm saying. I mean, we could give it a lot of the things of things right now that we know are good and bad.

93
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I don't know about the child. Is that good or bad? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. For sure. I'm going to take something that doesn't belong to you.

94
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Good or bad. Yeah. But those, they're still basic and fundamental. You don't need a youth core to well.

95
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
There's a lot of people out there that don't get taught that stuff. And that's true, too.

96
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But that's all different issue. Okay. Well, I'm just making sure.

97
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Yeah. But if you're, I know what you're saying. You're saying good, like good ideas and good ideas.

98
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You're talking about your way specifically, which I think.

99
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
No, no, no, no. I would not. I would not. And I still, even, you know, I get in trouble for this because for instance,

100
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
if you were saying, oh, you shouldn't wake up at 430 in the morning. And I always say, like, yeah, I know.

101
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I'm not saying you have to wake up at 430 in the morning. I'm saying to wake up earlier. Don't be lazy.

102
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Yeah. Right. I'm not saying you have to. I say, you know, don't eat donuts, right? I'm not saying you can never taste anything that tastes good.

103
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I'm just saying, be smart. Man, come on. You don't need to donut.

104
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You don't know. It's a really actually on the evil. They might just be peer evil too, by the way. Right. Very well.

105
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Come on, man. Don't know, Sony. They don't even make you feel. I mean, is there any, do you get any satisfaction from a donut?

106
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Status will depends on what you mean by satisfaction. You always want to try and parse these things. Well, you can't.

107
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's not absolutely okay. So I guess you get a 10 second taste in your mouth. Sure.

108
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Yeah.

109
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Sure.

110
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You're rush.

111
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Yeah.

112
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, and technically pay for that.

113
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yeah.

114
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You're health and fitness.

115
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Sure.

116
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You know, it seemed to care.

117
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
No.

118
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
You mean, I'm trying to look at it from all angles.

119
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Satisfaction. Yeah. Technically and by luck.

120
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Okay. But you could go for some fundamental good things. And I'll tell you this.

121
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The military does teach some fundamental good things. So if I could have joined at the age of 13, it would have been good for me.

122
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I would have been stoked. Actually, I would have missed out on some cool stuff too, because I had some fun back in the jury.

123
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I did a cool stuff.

124
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
That actually led to me being who I am today.

125
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You know, I learned some stuff.

126
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But not what I'm saying. The point is, is that your way, not everyone will agree.

127
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I agree with you.

128
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Oh, okay.

129
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And I'm sure a bunch of people do.

130
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah.

131
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But I'm just saying this like different.

132
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
No, I guess I'm not pro universal brainwashing to my methods of.

133
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Yeah.

134
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm not, I'm not, which makes 13 year old by the way.

135
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Yeah.

136
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Which is 13 year old.

137
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now, I'll tell you.

138
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I just said that that going in the military, I would have missed out on some things.

139
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You know, maybe some growing up experiences.

140
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Marista Sack didn't miss out on a on a damn thing because he was getting after it in many different ways.

141
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Not only on the battlefield, but also as a.

142
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
A little bit of a maniac.

143
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
He was, first of all, he was like apparently physically.

144
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He was kind of a beast of a man.

145
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And like physically.

146
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And he fought.

147
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
He kind of proved himself.

148
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
He distinguished himself in some big battles as he was 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old.

149
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Apparently he could bend a horseshoe with his head.

150
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
With his hand and I was looking at that.

151
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I was thinking myself, he, they mean hands, right?

152
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They must mean hands.

153
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Yeah.

154
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It didn't say that.

155
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's at hand.

156
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And I didn't want to take anything away from him.

157
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So apparently he could grab a, he was big and

158
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
could grab a horseshoe and just bend it in one hand.

159
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So he had some serious strength and through his life,

160
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
he commanded companies, which he actually refers to as centuries,

161
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
which if you can imagine century, we know that means 100.

162
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So a century, like the ancient Roman army had centuries,

163
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
instead of companies.

164
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And they weren't even 100 people.

165
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
They were like 80 people.

166
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
But he led those, he led regiments.

167
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And he led whole armies.

168
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And he fought with a lot of success throughout his career.

169
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now with that, that being said,

170
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
he was far from what anyone would actually

171
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
consider role model because he, the way he lived his personal life,

172
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
who's not exactly exemplary, exemplary.

173
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I didn't say that word right.

174
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Exemplary.

175
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Yes.

176
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
In fact, well, the way he lived his life was probably the opposite

177
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of role model.

178
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So he was forced into marriage at the age of 18.

179
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
He didn't want to get married because he, I think he was,

180
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
too much of a woman, I certainly said, I don't want to get married.

181
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But he married this eras, 14 year old eras with a ton of money.

182
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
He blew all her money.

183
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And he was 18, she was 18, she was 14.

184
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
She was, she was an eras with a bunch of money.

185
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
He took all her money and blew it on horses for his regimen.

186
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And on women,

187
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
mistresses.

188
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And then he had a bunch of public affairs.

189
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And everyone kind of knew about it.

190
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And the marriage got unrolled.

191
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And he continued this kind of want and behavior.

192
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I think throughout his life.

193
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And a couple times he's hypocritical.

194
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Because in the book he talks about certain types of people.

195
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And I don't know if I cover it.

196
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
But he does come across a little bit.

197
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Hypocrinical sometimes.

198
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Now, I think one of, this is this one quote I grabbed from this mistress.

199
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
This kind of famous mistress.

200
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Actually, she's recognized as the chief mistress of King Louis XV.

201
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So did you know that the King had, like not just mistresses?

202
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
We know that.

203
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But there's a chief mistress who's known.

204
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Yeah.

205
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Her name was Madam Depompador.

206
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And this is what she said about sex.

207
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Marista sex does not understand anything about the delicacy of love.

208
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The only pleasure he takes in the society of women can be summed up in one word debotuary.

209
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So he's a little bit out of control.

210
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
He might have, in fact, inherited his lifestyle choices from his dad,

211
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
whose name was Frederick Augustus, who was well known for his personal unbridled lust.

212
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
How do you know that he had unbridled lust?

213
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Well, case and point.

214
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Marista was the eldest.

215
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So Marista sex was the eldest of 354 acknowledged illegitimate children that Frederick father.

216
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So while we might not want to emulate Marista sex's personal life,

217
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
he was an experienced and successful leader of men on the battlefield.

218
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And we can learn from him.

219
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And with that, let's go back to the book.

220
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And here's Marista sex.

221
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
The man who has the talent for architecture and can design will draw the plan and perspective of a palace with great skill.

222
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But if he is to execute it, if he does not know how to shape his stones to lay his foundation,

223
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
the whole edifice will crash soon.

224
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
It's the same with a general who does not know the principles of his art,

225
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
nor how to organize his troops.

226
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
For these are indispensable qualifications in all the operations of war.

227
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The prodigious success with which the Romans always gained with small armies against

228
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
multitudes of barbarians can be attributed to nothing but the excellent composition of their troops.

229
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Not that I would infer from this that a man of genius will not be able to succeed,

230
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
even at the head of an army of tartars.

231
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It is much this is the interesting part.

232
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It is much easier to take men as they are than to make them as they should be.

233
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It is difficult to reconcile opinions, prejudice, prejudices and passions.

234
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So there's a couple interesting things.

235
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I also forgot to point out that he wrote this kind of on a whim.

236
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And he actually starts off this whole book.

237
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
He says, this work was not born from a desire to establish a new method of the art of war.

238
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It was composed to amuse and instruct myself.

239
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And then one of the last things he says in the book is,

240
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to the readers, I wrote this book in 13 nights.

241
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I was sick.

242
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Thus it very probably shows the fever I had.

243
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
This should supply my excuses for the irregularity of the arrangement,

244
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
as well as the in elegance of the style.

245
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I wrote militarily to anticipate my boredom.

246
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Now on top of those, that excuse, right?

247
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
On top of that, he was a big opium user.

248
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So we're figuring he was probably right in this in an impaired state.

249
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
We're dealing with it.

250
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
We're not, we're not mad about it, but we're realistic.

251
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And the reason I say this is because some of the writing is a little bit tricky

252
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and some run on sentences.

253
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And yeah, so we have to, we have to pull a little bit harder.

254
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
It's nuggets, but there's plenty of nuggets.

255
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And I think that's one of them.

256
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It's much easier to take men as they are than to make them as they should be.

257
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And where I look at that as a leader, you get people that are good at something.

258
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And you get someone that's not good at something,

259
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
but they're good at something else.

260
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
You put people where you can use them.

261
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You put people where their skills are most available and where they can,

262
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
where they can perform their duties to the highest level,

263
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because they're naturally good at it.

264
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
That's all it's saying.

265
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I'm not having you proofread my writing at night, right?

266
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yeah, no.

267
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
No.

268
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
No, I'm not.

269
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And I'm not over here trying to make videos.

270
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

271
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
You see what I'm going with us?

272
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yes.

273
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It would be easier if you said, you know what, Jocco?

274
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
When it comes to podcast, why don't you come up with a talking,

275
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
a bunch of talking, and I'll make cool videos, right?

276
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
We kind of did that.

277
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Otherwise, people would be listening to you.

279
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Talk about movies from 1988 and comparing them to stuff.

280
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Yeah, very, very clunky.

281
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Which is, you know, it's fine.

282
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Yeah.

283
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But, and then wouldn't you have to expand more resources in your part to coach me up?

284
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Yeah, so I'm imagining that.

285
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yeah, and I'd be trying to make videos, which I can,

286
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and I'd be having to coach you.

287
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Which you make me mad.

288
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
We don't want that.

289
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
No, it would make me mad, because it's dealing with computers and stuff.

290
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Yeah, I don't mind computers, but I don't like them.

291
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Sure.

292
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
No.

293
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So.

294
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Yeah.

295
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
But that's a big part of why he's saying it, though, right?

296
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Because it's like, you're going to save yourself a lot of time and headache.

297
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
When you're trying to coach these guys up and stuff.

298
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
When you get to the seal teams, it's like, oh, you're a small guy.

299
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Cool.

300
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
You're going to be a point, man.

301
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

302
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
You're a big guy.

303
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Cool.

304
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You're going to carry an M60 or an Altsomark 48.

305
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
That's how it's happening.

306
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
We're not going to take the small guy and try and get him to come up.

307
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
They can taller and bigger and stronger, and we're not going to take the big guy and

308
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
starve him.

309
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
It's enderman to range your school.

310
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So he loses 38 pounds and he comes back and like, okay, your appointment now.

311
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
No, let's use nature.

312
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
He talks about that in other places.

313
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
All right.

314
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
He's talking about in this section how to, how to raise an army basically.

315
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
How do you make an army?

316
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.80
And I thought this one was a little bit interesting because people ask me this question all the

317
00:19:07.80 --> 00:19:10.80
time he's talking about mandatory service.

318
00:19:10.80 --> 00:19:12.60
And this is his opinion on it.

319
00:19:12.60 --> 00:19:16.72
Would it not be better to prescribe by law that every man, whatever his condition in life,

320
00:19:16.72 --> 00:19:20.80
should be obliged to serve his prince and his country for five years.

321
00:19:20.80 --> 00:19:21.80
Doesn't that's no joke.

322
00:19:21.80 --> 00:19:27.12
Sometimes people say two years and that seems reasonable and a lot of countries do that.

323
00:19:27.12 --> 00:19:30.08
He says five years and it's kind of funny his attitude towards five years back to the

324
00:19:30.08 --> 00:19:31.08
book.

325
00:19:31.08 --> 00:19:34.84
This law could not be objected to because it is natural and just that all said is since

326
00:19:34.84 --> 00:19:37.84
he should occupy themselves with the defense of the nation.

327
00:19:37.84 --> 00:19:44.16
Conquer, no inconvenience could result if they were chosen between the ages of 20 and 30 years.

328
00:19:44.16 --> 00:19:51.60
These are all the years of liberty niche when you seek its fortune travels the country and

329
00:19:51.60 --> 00:19:54.64
is of little comfort to parents.

330
00:19:54.64 --> 00:19:59.72
This would not be a public calamity because one could be sure that when five years

331
00:19:59.72 --> 00:20:02.28
had passed, discharge would be granted.

332
00:20:02.28 --> 00:20:04.88
So he's saying like people couldn't be mad about it because it's only five years.

333
00:20:04.88 --> 00:20:07.08
And he's also saying, look, this is when your kids are out of control in ways.

334
00:20:07.08 --> 00:20:09.48
You might as well happen in the military.

335
00:20:09.48 --> 00:20:14.40
There's that whole idea of the liberty in that took place back in the day.

336
00:20:14.40 --> 00:20:21.76
And these guys were basically wild morally getting after it or I should they were, they

337
00:20:21.76 --> 00:20:24.32
were, they were partying wicked heart.

338
00:20:24.32 --> 00:20:26.48
I'm trying to think of a good way to say it.

339
00:20:26.48 --> 00:20:30.36
They were partying wicked heart with drugs, booze and women.

340
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:37.84
The libertyans and they, they called them a rake like a guy, a guy that was out there

341
00:20:37.84 --> 00:20:39.96
with a bunch of different women all the time.

342
00:20:39.96 --> 00:20:40.96
They'd be called the rake.

343
00:20:40.96 --> 00:20:45.000
There's a bunch of period novels that I had to read when I was in college.

344
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.96
That's why I know about it about these liberty and rakes.

345
00:20:49.96 --> 00:20:54.88
So he continues on this method of raising troops would provide an inexhaustible reservoir

346
00:20:54.88 --> 00:20:58.52
of fine recruits who would not be subject to desertion.

347
00:20:58.52 --> 00:21:02.72
And of course of time as a consequence it would be regarded as an honor to have fulfilled

348
00:21:02.72 --> 00:21:03.72
one service.

349
00:21:03.72 --> 00:21:06.64
I'd say that's probably accurate.

350
00:21:06.64 --> 00:21:11.04
But to produce this effect is essential to make no distinctions to be immovable on this

351
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:16.52
point and to enforce the law particularly on the nobles and the rich.

352
00:21:16.52 --> 00:21:17.68
Then no one will complain.

353
00:21:17.68 --> 00:21:21.24
Hey, you've got to, you've got to do it to, one person, you've got to do it to everyone

354
00:21:21.24 --> 00:21:22.24
equally.

355
00:21:22.24 --> 00:21:28.48
But consequently those who had not served their time will scorn those who are reluctant to obey

356
00:21:28.48 --> 00:21:33.16
the law and insensibly it will become an honor to serve.

357
00:21:33.16 --> 00:21:39.24
The poor bourgeois who will be consoled by the example of the rich and the rich will not

358
00:21:39.24 --> 00:21:42.40
dare complain upon seeing the nobles serve.

359
00:21:42.40 --> 00:21:44.56
Arms is an honorable profession.

360
00:21:44.56 --> 00:21:46.68
How many princes have borne arms?

361
00:21:46.68 --> 00:21:50.60
Now what's interesting about this idea is that there's some people in the world that aren't

362
00:21:50.60 --> 00:21:53.08
really meant for warfare.

363
00:21:53.08 --> 00:21:57.48
And social we let nature, I more heavily agree with the previous point.

364
00:21:57.48 --> 00:22:00.28
You should let people do what they're good at naturally.

365
00:22:00.28 --> 00:22:04.20
So you're going to end up recruiting people that might not be good at this naturally.

366
00:22:04.20 --> 00:22:05.20
And that's not a good thing.

367
00:22:05.20 --> 00:22:07.000
But not everyone was a war right?

368
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
No, you're right.

369
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.24
You could put them in different jobs.

370
00:22:09.24 --> 00:22:11.24
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

371
00:22:11.24 --> 00:22:19.08
They could put the guy that's more, more apt to be good at writing.

372
00:22:19.08 --> 00:22:21.08
He could become a military journalist.

373
00:22:21.08 --> 00:22:23.000
Yeah, you're right.

374
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
People always ask me that question.

375
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.12
And the bottom line is it's a tough one.

376
00:22:27.12 --> 00:22:31.24
I'm sure I don't have like some hardcore stance on it one way or the other.

377
00:22:31.24 --> 00:22:37.24
Do I think it would benefit everyone every 18 year old if they join the military?

378
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:38.24
It would benefit them.

379
00:22:38.24 --> 00:22:39.84
I'm telling you it would benefit them.

380
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:41.56
Do I think it should be mandatory?

381
00:22:41.56 --> 00:22:45.84
I don't really think so because I don't want to have a bunch of drafts in the military.

382
00:22:45.84 --> 00:22:48.52
And if you don't want to join it, you want to miss out on having that partner life.

383
00:22:48.52 --> 00:22:49.68
And that's what you're called.

384
00:22:49.68 --> 00:22:51.64
And that's why in the America you can do what you want.

385
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:52.64
Yeah, that makes sense.

386
00:22:52.64 --> 00:22:57.28
Because on one hand, you kind of can look at it as like taxes, right?

387
00:22:57.28 --> 00:23:02.36
Where how it just like how this access is saying, you know, you have to have the

388
00:23:02.36 --> 00:23:08.24
I'm preferring the pleasure or the honor to serve in one's your country's defense.

389
00:23:08.24 --> 00:23:11.08
You know, like that should be obvious.

390
00:23:11.08 --> 00:23:14.84
And so it's kind of like compared with paint taxes, right?

391
00:23:14.84 --> 00:23:16.28
Taxes go to public service.

392
00:23:16.28 --> 00:23:17.28
Like for all this stuff.

393
00:23:17.28 --> 00:23:18.28
We live in this country.

394
00:23:18.28 --> 00:23:19.28
We have public service.

395
00:23:19.28 --> 00:23:20.48
We all have to pay for it.

396
00:23:20.48 --> 00:23:21.48
Not just one person.

397
00:23:21.48 --> 00:23:22.48
Yeah.

398
00:23:22.48 --> 00:23:23.48
We all pay.

399
00:23:23.48 --> 00:23:24.48
I want to pay a lot more than other people.

400
00:23:24.48 --> 00:23:25.48
Yeah, exactly right?

401
00:23:25.48 --> 00:23:26.48
A lot more.

402
00:23:26.48 --> 00:23:27.48
Yeah.

403
00:23:27.48 --> 00:23:28.48
I think it's some people don't really pay taxes.

404
00:23:28.48 --> 00:23:29.48
And that's how the military would have been.

405
00:23:29.48 --> 00:23:31.08
You just said everyone pays their tax done.

406
00:23:31.08 --> 00:23:32.08
Not everyone pays.

407
00:23:32.08 --> 00:23:33.08
I know that.

408
00:23:33.08 --> 00:23:34.08
And it's the fight.

409
00:23:34.08 --> 00:23:35.08
What if?

410
00:23:35.08 --> 00:23:36.08
Okay.

411
00:23:36.08 --> 00:23:37.08
So good.

412
00:23:37.08 --> 00:23:38.08
Yeah, perfect.

413
00:23:38.08 --> 00:23:39.08
Exactly.

414
00:23:39.08 --> 00:23:40.88
Part of my point is, so let's say, I'm like, hey, you just paid you to let's say it's tax

415
00:23:40.88 --> 00:23:41.88
times.

416
00:23:41.88 --> 00:23:42.88
April 15th, whatever.

417
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:44.88
So we'll pay taxes around just that.

418
00:23:44.88 --> 00:23:46.08
Yeah, I know I'm just saying.

419
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:47.88
But at the time, we're called a quarterly extra.

420
00:23:47.88 --> 00:23:49.88
You don't want none.

421
00:23:49.88 --> 00:23:51.88
I actually know about that.

422
00:23:51.88 --> 00:23:52.88
That's not the good stuff.

423
00:23:52.88 --> 00:23:53.88
Thankfully.

424
00:23:53.88 --> 00:23:54.88
Or not something.

425
00:23:54.88 --> 00:23:58.48
But let's just say for this example in 15th, that's when everyone knows it.

426
00:23:58.48 --> 00:23:59.48
You're right.

427
00:23:59.48 --> 00:24:01.68
And you're like, yeah, I just paid my taxes.

428
00:24:01.68 --> 00:24:02.68
Whatever.

429
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:04.88
I didn't like giving my money away, but that's it.

430
00:24:04.88 --> 00:24:08.08
Just like people in the draft situation or men and tear mills.

431
00:24:08.08 --> 00:24:09.08
I didn't want to.

432
00:24:09.08 --> 00:24:12.68
I would rather go be a rake or whatever.

433
00:24:12.68 --> 00:24:13.68
But I'm doing it.

434
00:24:13.68 --> 00:24:17.48
And boom, I did it. And then you got me or maybe that means someone else saying,

435
00:24:17.48 --> 00:24:18.68
oh, yeah, I didn't pay my taxes.

436
00:24:18.68 --> 00:24:19.28
Yeah.

437
00:24:19.28 --> 00:24:20.48
And then you're like, whoa, way, way.

438
00:24:20.48 --> 00:24:22.88
So you're saying it becomes an honor to pay your taxes.

439
00:24:22.88 --> 00:24:23.48
In a way.

440
00:24:23.48 --> 00:24:24.28
I could agree with you.

441
00:24:24.28 --> 00:24:25.08
No, no, no, no.

442
00:24:25.08 --> 00:24:28.08
There's I think there's a part of your brain, no matter how much you pay for taxes.

443
00:24:28.08 --> 00:24:32.28
It is like, you do have that feeling like I did my part, even though it's soft,

444
00:24:32.28 --> 00:24:36.88
even though it hurt, even though, you know, a way rather spent it on a Disney vacation

445
00:24:36.88 --> 00:24:37.68
or something like that.

446
00:24:37.68 --> 00:24:40.28
No, I would have rather been a bit of a little bit of a self into something that was

447
00:24:40.28 --> 00:24:40.88
productive.

448
00:24:40.88 --> 00:24:42.68
I built more business or something like that.

449
00:24:42.68 --> 00:24:44.08
You know, just little things like that.

450
00:24:44.08 --> 00:24:44.88
But whatever.

451
00:24:44.88 --> 00:24:46.28
You see what I'm saying.

452
00:24:46.28 --> 00:24:46.68
All right.

453
00:24:46.68 --> 00:24:47.68
I mean, I hear you.

454
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:48.68
It's kind of the same thing.

455
00:24:48.68 --> 00:24:50.28
That's one way to look at it though.

456
00:24:50.28 --> 00:24:51.08
Or you can.

457
00:24:51.08 --> 00:24:52.68
But the other, the other one way.

458
00:24:52.68 --> 00:24:53.28
Yeah.

459
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:53.28
Yeah.

460
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:58.68
But the other way is just like, you said, if you get some people who are in there in the military,

461
00:24:58.68 --> 00:25:03.48
with certain like jobs or whatever, and they don't want to be there, it's kind of too

462
00:25:03.48 --> 00:25:05.08
important to have people like that.

463
00:25:05.08 --> 00:25:05.28
Yeah.

464
00:25:05.28 --> 00:25:06.88
But you could have, yeah.

465
00:25:06.88 --> 00:25:12.28
What you said is actually correct that you could have elements that just did other things

466
00:25:12.28 --> 00:25:18.28
in the military that would be more aligned with the person's natural desires of what they want

467
00:25:18.28 --> 00:25:19.28
to do.

468
00:25:19.28 --> 00:25:20.28
Yeah.

469
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:21.68
And now there's something in the Navy called Needs of the Navy, right?

470
00:25:21.68 --> 00:25:26.88
So you would get a Navy, you, oh, I want to go get stationed in Hawaii.

471
00:25:26.88 --> 00:25:28.68
Like, OK, what are the needs of the Navy?

472
00:25:28.68 --> 00:25:31.28
Because the needs of the Navy come first, not you, not your family, nothing.

473
00:25:31.28 --> 00:25:32.28
Yeah.

474
00:25:32.28 --> 00:25:34.68
And so the needs of the Navy come first.

475
00:25:34.68 --> 00:25:35.68
Well, yeah.

476
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:39.28
And of course, same thing with like a tax situation where it's like, you're, if you don't

477
00:25:39.28 --> 00:25:44.28
want to do it, it's kind of hard to be like, I know you don't want to do it.

478
00:25:44.28 --> 00:25:46.88
But hey, it's now that you're here, do what you want.

479
00:25:46.88 --> 00:25:50.08
You know, you can't say that otherwise, I'll be like, I don't want to be here.

480
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:51.08
So I can do what I can do.

481
00:25:51.08 --> 00:25:55.88
OK, I'm going to do the the most smallest, most light, least time consuming.

482
00:25:55.88 --> 00:25:59.28
Like basically I'm going to do the least I possibly can't because I don't want to be here

483
00:25:59.28 --> 00:26:00.28
to be in the military.

484
00:26:00.28 --> 00:26:02.28
Is this the, this is the mandatory military.

485
00:26:02.28 --> 00:26:03.28
This will go for it.

486
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:03.28
Yes.

487
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:04.48
And that'll go for it.

488
00:26:04.48 --> 00:26:06.28
So you're going to get, this is kind of like,

489
00:26:06.28 --> 00:26:08.88
I guess you get people that would be not doing very much.

490
00:26:08.88 --> 00:26:11.28
Yeah, it's essentially a good, like, draft,

491
00:26:11.28 --> 00:26:16.88
Dodger kind of situation, but within, you know, who didn't actually dodge it.

492
00:26:16.88 --> 00:26:21.08
If I'm just saying, if it were a scenario like, we'll just put them where they're

493
00:26:21.08 --> 00:26:22.28
interests lie.

494
00:26:22.28 --> 00:26:24.28
Even though they have to be here, same thing.

495
00:26:24.28 --> 00:26:27.28
So I'm just saying that's the other side of the coin, where it's like, it's hard to

496
00:26:27.28 --> 00:26:30.48
make, make it work in an absolute kind of way.

497
00:26:30.48 --> 00:26:31.48
Check.

498
00:26:31.48 --> 00:26:36.48
All right, he talked a little bit about clothing troops, what they should wear.

499
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:38.48
And this is just, I thought this was interesting.

500
00:26:38.48 --> 00:26:41.48
Our uniform is not only expensive, but very, very uncomfortable.

501
00:26:41.48 --> 00:26:44.48
The soldier is neither shot nor cloth nor covered.

502
00:26:44.48 --> 00:26:48.48
The love of appearance prevails over attention to health.

503
00:26:48.48 --> 00:26:52.48
And this is one of the most important points demanding our attention.

504
00:26:52.48 --> 00:26:56.48
Hair is a dirty ornament for a soldier.

505
00:26:56.48 --> 00:27:00.48
And once the rainy season has arrived, his head has never dry.

506
00:27:00.48 --> 00:27:04.48
So it sounds to me like he's basically saying he doesn't care how he's looks.

507
00:27:04.48 --> 00:27:06.48
He's healed a win.

508
00:27:06.48 --> 00:27:11.48
So hair is a dirty ornament for a soldier in place of hats.

509
00:27:11.48 --> 00:27:13.48
I should prefer helmets as for shoes.

510
00:27:13.48 --> 00:27:14.48
This was interesting.

511
00:27:14.48 --> 00:27:17.48
You know, people wear minimalistic shoes,

512
00:27:17.48 --> 00:27:21.48
with out with zero heel to toe drop.

513
00:27:21.48 --> 00:27:25.48
If you're that expression, meaning it's the same level across.

514
00:27:25.48 --> 00:27:29.48
So it's any of the barefoot type shoes that they all say,

515
00:27:29.48 --> 00:27:37.48
oh, zero heel to toe drop, meaning there's not an eight millimeter difference between the height of the heel.

516
00:27:37.48 --> 00:27:40.48
And then it goes down to the height of the toe.

517
00:27:40.48 --> 00:27:41.48
This is what he says.

518
00:27:41.48 --> 00:27:48.48
As for shoes, I would prefer the soldiers to have shoes of thin leather with low heels.

519
00:27:48.48 --> 00:27:54.48
Instead of heavy boots, they would be perfectly shot and would march with better gray since low heels.

520
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:58.48
Would force them to turn out their toes, stretch their joints,

521
00:27:58.48 --> 00:28:02.48
and consequently, consequently draw in their shoulders.

522
00:28:02.48 --> 00:28:05.48
It's pretty interesting because everyone's all in the range of minimalistic shoes,

523
00:28:05.48 --> 00:28:10.48
which I actually wear shoes that don't have any heel to drop.

524
00:28:10.48 --> 00:28:10.48
Yeah.

525
00:28:10.48 --> 00:28:13.48
Maybe I'm caught up in that fad.

526
00:28:13.48 --> 00:28:14.48
But it's cool.

527
00:28:14.48 --> 00:28:17.48
But you know what, when we were kids, right, Chuck Taylor's?

528
00:28:17.48 --> 00:28:18.48
Yeah, Chuck Taylor's.

529
00:28:18.48 --> 00:28:19.48
Yeah.

530
00:28:19.48 --> 00:28:20.48
They have no heel to drop.

531
00:28:20.48 --> 00:28:22.48
People so wear them because they're good to go.

532
00:28:22.48 --> 00:28:24.48
That's kind of all well.

533
00:28:24.48 --> 00:28:25.48
Mostly all the way right now.

534
00:28:25.48 --> 00:28:26.48
Yeah.

535
00:28:26.48 --> 00:28:27.48
Well, there you go.

536
00:28:27.48 --> 00:28:29.48
You're in a big time trend.

537
00:28:29.48 --> 00:28:32.48
You're early adopter.

538
00:28:32.48 --> 00:28:33.48
Yeah.

539
00:28:33.48 --> 00:28:34.48
I didn't know about it.

540
00:28:34.48 --> 00:28:36.48
I brought much Chuck Taylor's a two narrow for me.

541
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:37.48
Two narrowed.

542
00:28:37.48 --> 00:28:37.48
Yeah.

543
00:28:37.48 --> 00:28:38.48
And they don't sell wide ones.

544
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:39.48
I've looked.

545
00:28:39.48 --> 00:28:41.48
All right.

546
00:28:41.48 --> 00:28:43.48
Pay, which got to pay people back to the book.

547
00:28:43.48 --> 00:28:46.48
Without going into detail about the different rates of pay,

548
00:28:46.48 --> 00:28:49.48
I shall only say that it should be ample.

549
00:28:49.48 --> 00:28:54.48
It is better to have a small number of well-capped and well-disciplined troops

550
00:28:54.48 --> 00:28:59.48
than to have a great number who are neglected in these matters.

551
00:28:59.48 --> 00:29:02.48
It is not the big armies that win battles.

552
00:29:02.48 --> 00:29:04.48
It is the good ones.

553
00:29:04.48 --> 00:29:06.48
Economy can boost people's push.

554
00:29:06.48 --> 00:29:08.48
Only to a certain point.

555
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:14.48
It has limits beyond which it degenerates into parsimony.

556
00:29:14.48 --> 00:29:16.48
I had to look that word up, by the way.

557
00:29:16.48 --> 00:29:17.48
parsimony.

558
00:29:17.48 --> 00:29:18.48
Yeah.

559
00:29:18.48 --> 00:29:19.48
Occasionally, you get one of those.

560
00:29:19.48 --> 00:29:21.48
It means just super cheap.

561
00:29:21.48 --> 00:29:23.48
Super cheap.

562
00:29:23.48 --> 00:29:26.48
It's interesting because that doesn't sound like the dad.

563
00:29:26.48 --> 00:29:28.48
It would fall in that category.

564
00:29:28.48 --> 00:29:29.48
parsimony.

565
00:29:29.48 --> 00:29:33.48
So if your dad would be considered parsimonious?

566
00:29:33.48 --> 00:29:34.48
I guess so.

567
00:29:34.48 --> 00:29:43.48
I know that my dad like many dads will drive an extra 18 miles to save three cents a gallon on gas.

568
00:29:43.48 --> 00:29:45.48
Is that all dads do that?

569
00:29:45.48 --> 00:29:46.48
No.

570
00:29:46.48 --> 00:29:47.48
They don't do that.

571
00:29:47.48 --> 00:29:48.48
Well, yeah.

572
00:29:48.48 --> 00:29:50.48
You drive 18 miles.

573
00:29:50.48 --> 00:29:53.48
You're in the ocean.

574
00:29:53.48 --> 00:29:54.48
That's the time.

575
00:29:54.48 --> 00:29:55.48
Yeah.

576
00:29:55.48 --> 00:29:56.48
I've heard of that before.

577
00:29:56.48 --> 00:29:58.48
Isn't that like a false thing though?

578
00:29:58.48 --> 00:30:00.48
Like because you drive your team.

579
00:30:00.48 --> 00:30:00.48
Yeah.

580
00:30:00.48 --> 00:30:01.48
For sure.

581
00:30:01.48 --> 00:30:02.48
Kind of put it, joke.

582
00:30:02.48 --> 00:30:06.48
You know, you get the app that has the cheapest gas prices in your area.

583
00:30:06.48 --> 00:30:07.48
Yeah.

584
00:30:07.48 --> 00:30:10.48
How much time are you spending looking at an app that you paid three dollars for to find out where the

585
00:30:10.48 --> 00:30:12.48
You saved two cents a gallon or gas?

586
00:30:12.48 --> 00:30:13.48
Yep.

587
00:30:13.48 --> 00:30:14.48
Now get it.

588
00:30:14.48 --> 00:30:15.48
I'm cheap.

589
00:30:15.48 --> 00:30:16.48
I inherited that.

590
00:30:16.48 --> 00:30:17.48
Right?

591
00:30:17.48 --> 00:30:18.48
I don't like to spend money.

592
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:21.48
I'm hard for me to part with the money, right?

593
00:30:21.48 --> 00:30:23.48
Including the tax man by the way.

594
00:30:23.48 --> 00:30:24.48
It's hard for you.

595
00:30:24.48 --> 00:30:25.48
So I get it.

596
00:30:25.48 --> 00:30:30.48
But I also have to have some like sometimes my dad could be irrational about it.

597
00:30:30.48 --> 00:30:31.48
Sure.

598
00:30:31.48 --> 00:30:33.48
You know, irrational just straight up crazy.

599
00:30:33.48 --> 00:30:36.48
Hey, well, you could save two cents.

600
00:30:36.48 --> 00:30:37.48
Yeah.

601
00:30:37.48 --> 00:30:38.48
Hey, if you know what?

602
00:30:38.48 --> 00:30:40.48
He gets fired up about that too.

603
00:30:40.48 --> 00:30:41.48
Yeah.

604
00:30:41.48 --> 00:30:42.48
That's another thing.

605
00:30:42.48 --> 00:30:45.48
You know, he always asked me how much the how much the gas out there in California.

606
00:30:45.48 --> 00:30:47.48
I'm like, I don't know what I'm going to pay for anyways.

607
00:30:47.48 --> 00:30:50.48
Let's take the nozzle there and pull the trigger and rock it all.

608
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:51.48
I got stuff I got to do.

609
00:30:51.48 --> 00:30:52.48
I'm not right.

610
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:54.48
How much cheaper is gas on base?

611
00:30:54.48 --> 00:30:58.48
When I didn't know how much cheaper gas was on base, he was beside himself.

612
00:30:58.48 --> 00:30:59.48
Yeah.

613
00:30:59.48 --> 00:31:01.48
And then we found out it was eight cents a gallon cheaper.

614
00:31:01.48 --> 00:31:03.48
You can't get on base.

615
00:31:03.48 --> 00:31:07.48
You want to go drive over there, wait, line, show you right knee and then we get on base.

616
00:31:07.48 --> 00:31:08.48
You got to wait.

617
00:31:08.48 --> 00:31:09.48
Because no.

618
00:31:09.48 --> 00:31:10.48
Come on.

619
00:31:10.48 --> 00:31:12.48
Wait, is it because parsimonious?

620
00:31:12.48 --> 00:31:17.48
Yeah.

621
00:31:17.48 --> 00:31:19.48
I'm going to try to use that one.

622
00:31:19.48 --> 00:31:22.48
But that's because the because it's like a win, right?

623
00:31:22.48 --> 00:31:24.48
You get a win when you got the deal.

624
00:31:24.48 --> 00:31:26.48
You think you got psychological win?

625
00:31:26.48 --> 00:31:27.48
Yeah.

626
00:31:27.48 --> 00:31:28.48
Yeah.

627
00:31:28.48 --> 00:31:29.48
Yeah.

628
00:31:29.48 --> 00:31:31.48
I think that is it because yeah.

629
00:31:31.48 --> 00:31:33.48
People like that too.

630
00:31:33.48 --> 00:31:35.48
Back to the book.

631
00:31:35.48 --> 00:31:40.48
Hope encourages men to endure and attempt everything in depriving them of it or in making it

632
00:31:40.48 --> 00:31:45.48
too distant, you deprive them of their very soul.

633
00:31:45.48 --> 00:31:50.48
Now, that immediately made me think of the stolen crowd when we were reading about stolen

634
00:31:50.48 --> 00:31:51.48
ground.

635
00:31:51.48 --> 00:31:56.48
And the fact that the soldiers, when something would give them a glimmer of hope, it would

636
00:31:56.48 --> 00:31:57.48
totally change their attitude.

637
00:31:57.48 --> 00:32:02.48
Like when they thought that the German troops were coming to rescue the guys that were

638
00:32:02.48 --> 00:32:06.48
in stolen ground and the pocket in the stolen ground, they were all excited and they were

639
00:32:06.48 --> 00:32:10.48
so happy and he literally said everyone's morale went up and then they find out they're not

640
00:32:10.48 --> 00:32:11.48
coming to just crushed.

641
00:32:11.48 --> 00:32:12.48
Yeah.

642
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:13.48
Crushed morale.

643
00:32:13.48 --> 00:32:14.48
Yeah.

644
00:32:14.48 --> 00:32:15.48
That's based on hope.

645
00:32:15.48 --> 00:32:16.48
Yeah.

646
00:32:16.48 --> 00:32:17.48
Fully.

647
00:32:17.48 --> 00:32:22.48
And you kind of see that in like a workout, for example, like if you have a football

648
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:23.48
we don't have like conditioning.

649
00:32:23.48 --> 00:32:24.48
Right.

650
00:32:24.48 --> 00:32:27.48
And sometimes they just be like, hey, we're just running sprints.

651
00:32:27.48 --> 00:32:28.48
Win sprints.

652
00:32:28.48 --> 00:32:29.48
It wouldn't say, hey, we've got 10 wins sprints.

653
00:32:29.48 --> 00:32:31.48
It's not like that.

654
00:32:31.48 --> 00:32:34.48
And after a while, like guys are dying and not dying.

655
00:32:34.48 --> 00:32:36.48
But you don't wear getting tired.

656
00:32:36.48 --> 00:32:38.48
So the sprints are a lot slower towards it.

657
00:32:38.48 --> 00:32:40.48
But they say, two more.

658
00:32:40.48 --> 00:32:43.48
Finish hard for all of a sudden everybody can run fast again.

659
00:32:43.48 --> 00:32:44.48
Yeah.

660
00:32:44.48 --> 00:32:46.48
Because you see that little light of the time.

661
00:32:46.48 --> 00:32:47.48
That second's pretty cool.

662
00:32:47.48 --> 00:32:48.48
I was kidding.

663
00:32:48.48 --> 00:32:49.48
Eight more.

664
00:32:49.48 --> 00:32:51.48
I'm going to do it.

665
00:32:51.48 --> 00:32:52.48
Yeah.

666
00:32:52.48 --> 00:32:54.48
And then you watch the hope just go, boom.

667
00:32:54.48 --> 00:32:57.48
Back to being slow.

668
00:32:57.48 --> 00:32:58.48
Back to the book.

669
00:32:58.48 --> 00:33:00.48
This is pretty heavy.

670
00:33:00.48 --> 00:33:08.48
Truly, the only good officers are the poor gentleman who have nothing but their sword and their cape.

671
00:33:08.48 --> 00:33:13.48
But it is essential that they should be able to live on their pay.

672
00:33:13.48 --> 00:33:19.48
The man who devotes himself to war should regard it as a religious order into which he enters.

673
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:25.48
He should have nothing, no other home than his troop.

674
00:33:25.48 --> 00:33:29.48
And should hold himself honored in his profession.

675
00:33:29.48 --> 00:33:32.48
So there you go.

676
00:33:32.48 --> 00:33:33.48
All in.

677
00:33:33.48 --> 00:33:34.48
Yeah.

678
00:33:34.48 --> 00:33:35.48
All in.

679
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:40.48
And when people always ask me, especially when I was in about work life balance and I'm like,

680
00:33:40.48 --> 00:33:45.48
I'm not the guy to talk about not the good person, especially when I was in the military.

681
00:33:45.48 --> 00:33:47.48
Because this was me.

682
00:33:47.48 --> 00:33:50.48
My number one priority 100% was the deems.

683
00:33:50.48 --> 00:33:52.48
Everything else was just kind of, hey.

684
00:33:52.48 --> 00:33:56.48
Everyone else is along for the ride, but I know where I'm going.

685
00:33:56.48 --> 00:34:02.48
So being that devoted to war and it has a power.

686
00:34:02.48 --> 00:34:07.48
That has a certain, it made, you know, if you got a guy that's thinking about all the time,

687
00:34:07.48 --> 00:34:08.48
I think it was Jade.

688
00:34:08.48 --> 00:34:10.48
Jade and I were talking about something.

689
00:34:10.48 --> 00:34:15.48
And he said, the person who cares more wins.

690
00:34:15.48 --> 00:34:16.48
Yeah.

691
00:34:16.48 --> 00:34:17.48
And that's accurate.

692
00:34:17.48 --> 00:34:18.48
Yeah.

693
00:34:18.48 --> 00:34:20.48
And I want a lot of stuff in my day.

694
00:34:20.48 --> 00:34:21.48
Just because I cared more.

695
00:34:21.48 --> 00:34:23.48
I mean, I'm not going to sleep.

696
00:34:23.48 --> 00:34:26.48
I'm just going to be thinking about this. You're going to go home.

697
00:34:26.48 --> 00:34:34.48
And this weekend, you're going to go and do a family barbecue and you're going to go play baseball with the kids and

698
00:34:34.48 --> 00:34:35.48
Bubblebot.

699
00:34:35.48 --> 00:34:37.48
And I was just like, no, I'm just going to be doing this all weekend.

700
00:34:37.48 --> 00:34:38.48
I'll be working on this.

701
00:34:38.48 --> 00:34:40.48
We're going, I'm, I got, I care about this.

702
00:34:40.48 --> 00:34:41.48
Yeah.

703
00:34:41.48 --> 00:34:42.48
Nothing else matters.

704
00:34:42.48 --> 00:34:47.48
So that's a, again, is it healthy for work life balance?

705
00:34:47.48 --> 00:34:48.48
No.

706
00:34:48.48 --> 00:34:49.48
It's not worth healthy.

707
00:34:49.48 --> 00:34:53.48
Except for to say, if you're that committed to your work, you're committed person, then I'm

708
00:34:53.48 --> 00:34:54.48
going to try to take care of your family.

709
00:34:54.48 --> 00:34:55.48
I thought I'm necessarily a bad thing.

710
00:34:55.48 --> 00:34:56.48
Am I reaching?

711
00:34:56.48 --> 00:34:57.48
Maybe.

712
00:34:57.48 --> 00:34:57.48
Yeah.

713
00:34:57.48 --> 00:34:58.48
I think you're.

714
00:34:58.48 --> 00:34:58.48
Okay.

715
00:34:58.48 --> 00:34:59.48
I'm reaching.

716
00:34:59.48 --> 00:34:59.48
That's fine.

717
00:34:59.48 --> 00:35:08.48
You know, Mary, a good independent woman, that doesn't need emotional support for you all the time.

718
00:35:08.48 --> 00:35:10.48
So she understands that that was the big thing for me.

719
00:35:10.48 --> 00:35:16.48
I think my wife understood that it wasn't meant as an offensive thing.

720
00:35:16.48 --> 00:35:17.48
Yeah.

721
00:35:17.48 --> 00:35:21.48
I have a job and I really care about my job.

722
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:24.48
Doesn't mean I don't care about you, but my job is right now.

723
00:35:24.48 --> 00:35:25.48
And I need to do that.

724
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:26.48
Yeah.

725
00:35:26.48 --> 00:35:27.48
And even the work life balance.

726
00:35:27.48 --> 00:35:28.48
My stupidity has been.

727
00:35:28.48 --> 00:35:34.48
No, no, because the work life, no, because there is no templated time, a lot of, you know,

728
00:35:34.48 --> 00:35:38.48
that you need to spend with these people, those people are work versus the fact, there's

729
00:35:38.48 --> 00:35:43.48
no like thing, you know, sometimes if you're like, hey, I need to spend more time with my wife.

730
00:35:43.48 --> 00:35:46.48
Your wife's like, bro, go do, give me a loan.

731
00:35:46.48 --> 00:35:50.48
You know, like, we spent the weekend again, calm down, you know, go to work or whatever.

732
00:35:50.48 --> 00:35:52.48
Some people like that in the, it's a spectrum.

733
00:35:52.48 --> 00:35:57.48
So work life balance is like it depends on your wife and, you know, in a husband, why situation?

734
00:35:57.48 --> 00:36:03.48
You know, I suppose instead of trying to take a life work life balance, lessen out of this, I think the most important thing to take out of this is

735
00:36:03.48 --> 00:36:05.48
is the level of commitment, right?

736
00:36:05.48 --> 00:36:07.48
If you really want to be successful, yeah.

737
00:36:07.48 --> 00:36:08.48
And I'm not just talking about war.

738
00:36:08.48 --> 00:36:09.48
I'm talking about business.

739
00:36:09.48 --> 00:36:10.48
I'm talking about life.

740
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:13.48
If you really want to be successful, you got to, you got to get after it.

741
00:36:13.48 --> 00:36:14.48
Yeah.

742
00:36:14.48 --> 00:36:16.48
That's the other things aside for now.

743
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:16.48
Yeah.

744
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:16.48
Right.

745
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:17.48
Just the way it is.

746
00:36:17.48 --> 00:36:18.48
Yeah.

747
00:36:18.48 --> 00:36:18.48
Yeah.

748
00:36:18.48 --> 00:36:20.48
Sorry.

749
00:36:20.48 --> 00:36:21.48
All right.

750
00:36:21.48 --> 00:36:23.48
Back to the book, training.

751
00:36:23.48 --> 00:36:29.48
Drill is necessary to make the soldier steady and skillful, although it does not warrant exclusive attention.

752
00:36:29.48 --> 00:36:32.48
Among all the elements of war.

753
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:35.48
It even is the one that deserves the least.

754
00:36:35.48 --> 00:36:39.48
If one accepts those which are dangerous.

755
00:36:39.48 --> 00:36:41.48
I tried to figure out that, man.

756
00:36:41.48 --> 00:36:42.48
I just thought, OPM.

757
00:36:42.48 --> 00:36:43.48
That was an OPM.

758
00:36:43.48 --> 00:36:44.48
Yeah.

759
00:36:44.48 --> 00:36:45.48
Hit right there.

760
00:36:45.48 --> 00:36:46.48
The last part.

761
00:36:46.48 --> 00:36:49.48
The foundation of training depends, oh, this is good.

762
00:36:49.48 --> 00:36:50.48
But, but, okay.

763
00:36:50.48 --> 00:36:55.48
So, Drill, if you don't think about the military, drill, especially back in those days, it

764
00:36:55.48 --> 00:36:59.48
was, it really was a necessary thing, because you had to function together as a team.

765
00:36:59.48 --> 00:37:02.48
And the way you do that, we still do what's called close order drill in the military.

766
00:37:02.48 --> 00:37:07.48
Now, you've seen it go watch the US Marine Corps, close order silent drill team.

767
00:37:07.48 --> 00:37:09.48
They do all these really specific maneuvers.

768
00:37:09.48 --> 00:37:13.98
And they have competitions and high schools between the ROTC classes, where you know you're

769
00:37:13.98 --> 00:37:16.48
caring the rifle, you spin, you do all that stuff.

770
00:37:16.48 --> 00:37:17.48
That's called drill.

771
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:18.48
Yeah.

772
00:37:18.48 --> 00:37:22.48
The reason it originated is because you needed, for two reasons, number one, you actually had

773
00:37:22.48 --> 00:37:27.48
to do those motions on the battlefield, rage, rifle, load, make ready, aim, fire.

774
00:37:27.48 --> 00:37:28.98
And then the next rank will be doing the same thing.

775
00:37:28.98 --> 00:37:31.48
You had to do it in a coordinated method.

776
00:37:31.48 --> 00:37:36.48
And the other reason that they kept doing it according to my drill instructor in off your

777
00:37:36.48 --> 00:37:42.98
unit school, gunnery sergeant, United States Marine Corps, all the enough last name was Seals.

778
00:37:42.98 --> 00:37:44.98
Those are the last name, great guy.

779
00:37:44.98 --> 00:37:45.98
Layers.

780
00:37:45.98 --> 00:37:46.98
Yeah, Layers.

781
00:37:46.98 --> 00:37:52.98
Gunnery sergeant Seals, my drill instructor from the United States Marine Corps, at

782
00:37:52.98 --> 00:37:56.98
Officer Canada School, he said the reason that you're learning this drill is because the

783
00:37:56.98 --> 00:38:02.98
reason that we do drill is because people need to act instantly upon orders.

784
00:38:02.98 --> 00:38:07.98
So it drills into your level of obedience when you get told by the left flank, march everyone

785
00:38:07.98 --> 00:38:11.68
goes, by the right flank, march everyone goes.

786
00:38:11.68 --> 00:38:13.68
So it teaches you that, ham, going to go.

787
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:17.28
That's what they used to use it for, but they still use it now to so that people get used

788
00:38:17.28 --> 00:38:18.98
to the immediate obedience of orders.

789
00:38:18.98 --> 00:38:22.98
Now, does that get contradicted by things that I talk about all the time on here, but questioning

790
00:38:22.98 --> 00:38:24.48
orders and making sure you understand why you're doing it?

791
00:38:24.48 --> 00:38:25.98
Yeah, it does absolutely.

792
00:38:25.98 --> 00:38:28.98
But there is a, that's why that's what it exists for.

793
00:38:28.98 --> 00:38:29.98
Yeah.

794
00:38:29.98 --> 00:38:30.98
Yeah.

795
00:38:30.98 --> 00:38:31.98
And at least the capability to do that.

796
00:38:31.98 --> 00:38:32.98
Is there?

797
00:38:32.98 --> 00:38:33.98
Yes.

798
00:38:33.98 --> 00:38:35.98
The capability is there.

799
00:38:35.98 --> 00:38:43.88
Back to the book, the foundation of training depends on the legs and not the arms.

800
00:38:43.88 --> 00:38:50.82
All the mystery of maneuvers and combat is in the legs and it is to the legs that we

801
00:38:50.82 --> 00:38:56.54
should apply ourselves, whoever claims otherwise is but a fool and not only in the elements

802
00:38:56.54 --> 00:38:59.98
of what is called the profession of arms.

803
00:38:59.98 --> 00:39:01.78
So interestingly.

804
00:39:01.78 --> 00:39:07.78
There are personal problems with people that talk about skipping leg day.

805
00:39:07.78 --> 00:39:09.78
They go back to here.

806
00:39:09.78 --> 00:39:11.78
The big guns.

807
00:39:11.78 --> 00:39:12.78
The big arms.

808
00:39:12.78 --> 00:39:15.78
They don't want to help us in the, in the art of war.

809
00:39:15.78 --> 00:39:16.78
Yeah.

810
00:39:16.78 --> 00:39:17.78
According to sacks.

811
00:39:17.78 --> 00:39:18.78
In a while, they call that big for nothing.

812
00:39:18.78 --> 00:39:23.78
Actually big for nothing and then why it means like I guess here they say all go no

813
00:39:23.78 --> 00:39:24.78
show.

814
00:39:24.78 --> 00:39:25.78
Right.

815
00:39:25.78 --> 00:39:29.78
So that's kind of what having big arms and small legs kind of is as well.

816
00:39:29.78 --> 00:39:30.78
Right.

817
00:39:30.78 --> 00:39:31.78
You're on board with that.

818
00:39:31.78 --> 00:39:32.78
Well, yeah.

819
00:39:32.78 --> 00:39:33.78
No.

820
00:39:33.78 --> 00:39:34.78
I never was skipping legs day.

821
00:39:34.78 --> 00:39:38.78
You're the one teasing me and I was wondering why is that so funny but I guess yeah.

822
00:39:38.78 --> 00:39:40.78
That's why it's in the day one.

823
00:39:40.78 --> 00:39:41.78
It's a fool.

824
00:39:41.78 --> 00:39:42.78
Because you look like a fool.

825
00:39:42.78 --> 00:39:43.78
That's it.

826
00:39:43.78 --> 00:39:44.78
That's it.

827
00:39:44.78 --> 00:39:45.78
That's the answer.

828
00:39:45.78 --> 00:39:46.78
Dang.

829
00:39:46.78 --> 00:39:47.78
Yep.

830
00:39:47.78 --> 00:39:48.78
It goes back.

831
00:39:48.78 --> 00:39:49.78
Yeah.

832
00:39:49.78 --> 00:39:49.78
It goes back a long time.

833
00:39:49.78 --> 00:39:50.78
Even back then people were skipping leg day.

834
00:39:50.78 --> 00:39:51.78
Yeah.

835
00:39:51.78 --> 00:39:52.78
Because they were fools.

836
00:39:52.78 --> 00:39:53.78
Yeah.

837
00:39:53.78 --> 00:39:54.78
Oh, they're focusing on the wrong thing.

838
00:39:54.78 --> 00:39:55.78
And it makes sense.

839
00:39:55.78 --> 00:39:58.78
Even like in those terms, they make sense today.

840
00:39:58.78 --> 00:39:59.78
Let me tell you something.

841
00:39:59.78 --> 00:40:00.78
Well, the amount.

842
00:40:00.78 --> 00:40:06.78
When I was in the teams, I was running training and I still talk guys obviously.

843
00:40:06.78 --> 00:40:12.78
But if you think about what's going on, the train, like people, people, you know, I say all the time, like all the

844
00:40:12.78 --> 00:40:13.78
Seal training is not that hard.

845
00:40:13.78 --> 00:40:14.78
Right.

846
00:40:14.78 --> 00:40:15.78
I say all the time.

847
00:40:15.78 --> 00:40:16.78
Like, but I'm talking about buds.

848
00:40:16.78 --> 00:40:20.78
I'm telling you the advanced training that you go to, the training that I used to run.

849
00:40:20.78 --> 00:40:23.78
It's it's freaking really hard.

850
00:40:23.78 --> 00:40:24.78
It's really hard.

851
00:40:24.78 --> 00:40:25.78
You're in the desert.

852
00:40:25.78 --> 00:40:32.78
The desert, don't think of sand, think of rocks, think of jagged on the even terrain up and down hills.

853
00:40:32.78 --> 00:40:33.78
Yeah.

854
00:40:33.78 --> 00:40:34.78
Then think about your on night mission.

855
00:40:34.78 --> 00:40:35.78
So it's at night.

856
00:40:35.78 --> 00:40:41.78
Think about you have, let's call it about 80 pounds of gear on just on average.

857
00:40:41.78 --> 00:40:44.78
That's like the average guy's got 80 pounds of gear on.

858
00:40:44.78 --> 00:40:48.78
You're going to get dropped off in the middle of the desert.

859
00:40:48.78 --> 00:40:51.78
Again, not the desert, but the rocky.

860
00:40:51.78 --> 00:40:56.78
What's it called?

861
00:40:56.78 --> 00:40:59.78
Sub.

862
00:40:59.78 --> 00:41:02.78
I forget it's it's the rocky, crazy terrain.

863
00:41:02.78 --> 00:41:04.78
It's hard to walk on in the daytime.

864
00:41:04.78 --> 00:41:05.78
It's hard to walk on.

865
00:41:05.78 --> 00:41:06.78
Now you're at night.

866
00:41:06.78 --> 00:41:08.78
Now you have night vision on, which is great.

867
00:41:08.78 --> 00:41:10.78
But night vision is looking far away.

868
00:41:10.78 --> 00:41:12.78
And you can adjust one of your night vision side.

869
00:41:12.78 --> 00:41:15.78
So you have to and you can adjust one to one to close.

870
00:41:15.78 --> 00:41:18.78
So you can see a little bit, but still your peripheral vision isn't there.

871
00:41:18.78 --> 00:41:21.78
Yeah. So you can't really see what's actually underneath your feet.

872
00:41:21.78 --> 00:41:25.78
You can look down and then you can see it for a second, but you can't walk around looking down the whole time.

873
00:41:25.78 --> 00:41:26.78
You got to look at the guy in front of you.

874
00:41:26.78 --> 00:41:28.78
You got to look at the you feel the fire.

875
00:41:28.78 --> 00:41:33.78
So as you're walking, you're making these micro adjustments all the time to adapt to your foot,

876
00:41:33.78 --> 00:41:35.78
hitting the ground in some weird spot.

877
00:41:35.78 --> 00:41:36.78
And so you get that.

878
00:41:36.78 --> 00:41:38.78
And then you have that weight on your back.

879
00:41:38.78 --> 00:41:39.78
And so you get dropped off.

880
00:41:39.78 --> 00:41:41.78
Then you patrol 10 kilometers.

881
00:41:41.78 --> 00:41:43.78
10 kilometers.

882
00:41:43.78 --> 00:41:45.78
Maybe what what's that that's six miles.

883
00:41:45.78 --> 00:41:48.78
So you're going six miles. Then you get six miles.

884
00:41:48.78 --> 00:41:49.78
You get to a target area.

885
00:41:49.78 --> 00:41:50.78
You get to the target area.

886
00:41:50.78 --> 00:41:52.78
You got to get eyes on the target area.

887
00:41:52.78 --> 00:41:53.78
You know, you get eyes on.

888
00:41:53.78 --> 00:41:56.78
You climb the biggest hill around.

889
00:41:56.78 --> 00:41:58.78
At night being as quiet as you can.

890
00:41:58.78 --> 00:42:00.78
You get to the top of that hill.

891
00:42:00.78 --> 00:42:01.78
You look at it.

892
00:42:01.78 --> 00:42:02.78
Then you go and assault the target.

893
00:42:02.78 --> 00:42:04.78
Once you assault the target.

894
00:42:04.78 --> 00:42:06.78
Guess what you're getting for when you're assaulting the target.

895
00:42:06.78 --> 00:42:07.78
You're now like almost running.

896
00:42:07.78 --> 00:42:09.78
You're running through the thing.

897
00:42:09.78 --> 00:42:10.78
At night, your shoot machine guns.

898
00:42:10.78 --> 00:42:12.78
Guess what guys get hit guys go down.

899
00:42:12.78 --> 00:42:13.78
This is even entertaining.

900
00:42:13.78 --> 00:42:15.78
Now you're going to carry him. Well, we're going to carry him.

901
00:42:15.78 --> 00:42:17.78
Who's going to carry him? You are.

902
00:42:17.78 --> 00:42:18.78
What are you going to do? How are you going to carry him?

903
00:42:18.78 --> 00:42:20.78
You're going to there's only one way.

904
00:42:20.78 --> 00:42:21.78
Sure. Okay. There's stretchers.

905
00:42:21.78 --> 00:42:24.78
There's you can you can bring leaders and we certainly bring leaders in the field.

906
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:25.78
But they take some time to set up.

907
00:42:25.78 --> 00:42:27.78
And you got to get organized to make that happen.

908
00:42:27.78 --> 00:42:32.78
What's going to happen initially is somebody is going to sling that dude on his back.

909
00:42:32.78 --> 00:42:35.78
And by the way, that person that weighs 200 pounds has 80 pounds of gear with him.

910
00:42:35.78 --> 00:42:37.78
So now it's all in 280 pounds.

911
00:42:37.78 --> 00:42:42.78
You're going to put that person on your back and you're going to walk at a high rate of speed through this

912
00:42:42.78 --> 00:42:47.78
Rocky terrain and you're going to do that for another two to three miles to get out.

913
00:42:47.78 --> 00:42:51.78
It's hard that kind of training.

914
00:42:51.78 --> 00:42:54.78
And by the way, this whole time there's no like who y'all.

915
00:42:54.78 --> 00:42:59.78
There's no hey come on. There's no there's no you don't even speak.

916
00:42:59.78 --> 00:43:01.78
It's just in silence.

917
00:43:01.78 --> 00:43:04.78
Yeah. Just go with everyone knows what you have to do.

918
00:43:04.78 --> 00:43:09.78
And so that's why you got to do leg day.

919
00:43:09.78 --> 00:43:10.78
Yeah.

920
00:43:10.78 --> 00:43:15.78
Skip leg day because you're legs. You're legs got to carry that weight.

921
00:43:15.78 --> 00:43:16.78
Yeah.

922
00:43:16.78 --> 00:43:22.78
Going back to the book to return to the march about which everyone bothers themselves to the

923
00:43:22.78 --> 00:43:26.78
death, but will never reach a conclusion unless I reveal a secret.

924
00:43:26.78 --> 00:43:29.78
So he's got a secret about maneuvering troops.

925
00:43:29.78 --> 00:43:31.78
This is this I found this interesting.

926
00:43:31.78 --> 00:43:33.78
Some wish to march slowly.

927
00:43:33.78 --> 00:43:34.78
Others would march fast.

928
00:43:34.78 --> 00:43:39.78
But what about the troops whom no one knows how to make march fast or slowly.

929
00:43:39.78 --> 00:43:45.78
As the desire or is necessary and who require an officer at every corner to make them turn

930
00:43:45.78 --> 00:43:48.78
Like some snails and others are running.

931
00:43:48.78 --> 00:43:52.78
And this is to advance this column, which is always training.

932
00:43:52.78 --> 00:43:55.78
It is a comedy to see even a battalion to commence movements.

933
00:43:55.78 --> 00:44:00.78
So what he's talking about is if you're moving with a unit and this happens with a

934
00:44:00.78 --> 00:44:01.78
even happens with a pool tune.

935
00:44:01.78 --> 00:44:06.78
But it definitely happens when you get bigger elements, you know, a company sized element

936
00:44:06.78 --> 00:44:10.78
where you've got a hundred people that are moving.

937
00:44:10.78 --> 00:44:13.78
It's the caterpillar effect, right?

938
00:44:13.78 --> 00:44:16.78
Like the front moves and then it takes a little while for people to catch up.

939
00:44:16.78 --> 00:44:21.78
And then when they stop at room bumps into them and you end up with this thing that's really, really hard to move.

940
00:44:21.78 --> 00:44:22.78
Yeah.

941
00:44:22.78 --> 00:44:28.78
And this is so this is how he says this is his big secret.

942
00:44:28.78 --> 00:44:34.78
Shall I say it this great word which comprises all the mystery of the art and which

943
00:44:34.78 --> 00:44:38.78
will no doubt be seen as ridiculous?

944
00:44:38.78 --> 00:44:42.78
Have them March in cadence.

945
00:44:42.78 --> 00:44:48.78
That is why these musical marches were instituted and that is why one beats the drum.

946
00:44:48.78 --> 00:44:52.78
It is this which no one knows and no one has perceived.

947
00:44:52.78 --> 00:44:55.78
With this you can march fast or slow as you wish.

948
00:44:55.78 --> 00:44:57.78
The tail will not lose the distance.

949
00:44:57.78 --> 00:44:59.78
All your soldiers will start on the same foot.

950
00:44:59.78 --> 00:45:03.78
The changes of direction will be made together with speed and grace.

951
00:45:03.78 --> 00:45:06.78
And the legs of your soldiers will not get tangled up.

952
00:45:06.78 --> 00:45:11.78
You will not be forced to halt after each turn in order to start off on the same foot.

953
00:45:11.78 --> 00:45:17.78
Your soldiers will not exhaust themselves at quarter as much as that presence.

954
00:45:17.78 --> 00:45:21.78
Now what I thought was interesting about that is it's an obvious answer.

955
00:45:21.78 --> 00:45:25.78
Right? And now clearly you're not going to do that in the modern day military in the field.

956
00:45:25.78 --> 00:45:29.78
But you're not going to play music so guys can march to it.

957
00:45:29.78 --> 00:45:35.78
You can stay in cadence. But I think it's more important to that sometimes we lose things.

958
00:45:35.78 --> 00:45:38.78
We lose methods.

959
00:45:38.78 --> 00:45:41.78
They're in front of our face but we don't understand why they were there.

960
00:45:41.78 --> 00:45:43.78
And I'll tell you I was thinking of a story.

961
00:45:43.78 --> 00:45:45.78
I was running training.

962
00:45:45.78 --> 00:45:52.78
And one of my guys who was one of the assistant platoon commanders in T.

963
00:45:52.78 --> 00:45:59.78
And T. Bruser, great guy, hard to choke, a real long neck.

964
00:45:59.78 --> 00:46:02.78
You can make it happen. You're going to work for it.

965
00:46:02.78 --> 00:46:06.78
Real, well some people might think long neck easy to choke.

966
00:46:06.78 --> 00:46:09.78
No, this was his neck was so long and he was strong too.

967
00:46:09.78 --> 00:46:14.78
He is strong. Long and strong neck. So his neck would like bend and a guillotine.

968
00:46:14.78 --> 00:46:17.78
And he would keep breathing. Yeah, that was that long.

969
00:46:17.78 --> 00:46:23.78
So anyways, we were out at this training site and we were doing his, it was his platoon.

970
00:46:23.78 --> 00:46:26.78
Now he was a platoon commander and they were coming over the beach.

971
00:46:26.78 --> 00:46:30.78
And meaning swimming over the beach and then you go do live fire.

972
00:46:30.78 --> 00:46:34.78
And this really, so they're doing it. They're doing iterations.

973
00:46:34.78 --> 00:46:40.78
And he's coming up on the beach and is a weapons, you know, you, you, when you get to the beach,

974
00:46:40.78 --> 00:46:44.78
your weapons wet sandy because you go through the surf and it's all jacked up.

975
00:46:44.78 --> 00:46:48.78
And then you try and shoot your gun and doesn't work. You got to clean it and just to paint.

976
00:46:48.78 --> 00:46:55.78
And he says, hey, man, do you have any like suggestions on how to get my weapon firing?

977
00:46:55.78 --> 00:46:59.78
Once I get over the beach and I go, yeah, man, don't let it get wet.

978
00:46:59.78 --> 00:47:04.78
And he, and he was kind of, you know, like really? And I said, yeah, don't let it get wet.

979
00:47:04.78 --> 00:47:07.78
Because when you're swimming in, you've got a rock sack.

980
00:47:07.78 --> 00:47:11.78
But the rock sack isn't, it's, it's waterproofed. So it kind of floats.

981
00:47:11.78 --> 00:47:14.78
And so you can put your weapon on top of your rock sack.

982
00:47:14.78 --> 00:47:17.78
And you can kind of keep it dry there. And when you're just swimming, you just keep it.

983
00:47:17.78 --> 00:47:20.78
Now you're not going to keep your weapon completely dry. It's not going to happen.

984
00:47:20.78 --> 00:47:22.78
It's going to get wet.

985
00:47:22.78 --> 00:47:30.78
But the attitude, if you have the attitude that you're trying to keep it dry, you'll keep it 90

986
00:47:30.78 --> 00:47:35.78
percent more dry than you would otherwise. And most important when you come through the beach,

987
00:47:35.78 --> 00:47:39.78
when you come through the waves, you won't let it get the sand in it.

988
00:47:39.78 --> 00:47:44.78
And he kind of looked at me with, you know, a funny face of like, are you serious?

989
00:47:44.78 --> 00:47:46.78
Like, how can you keep it dry? And I said, keep it dry.

990
00:47:46.78 --> 00:47:50.78
Next time I'm watching him, but on night vision, I'm watching him and sure enough,

991
00:47:50.78 --> 00:47:52.78
he is, his weapon barely went in the water.

992
00:47:52.78 --> 00:47:54.78
You got up on the beach and boom, it works. Guess what?

993
00:47:54.78 --> 00:47:56.78
It's an obvious answer.

994
00:47:56.78 --> 00:48:00.78
But sometimes people, we know we just need this, have somebody share the obvious answer

995
00:48:00.78 --> 00:48:02.78
with us so that we can execute.

996
00:48:02.78 --> 00:48:03.78
Yeah.

997
00:48:03.78 --> 00:48:05.78
Yeah, makes sense.

998
00:48:05.78 --> 00:48:06.78
Yeah, makes sense.

999
00:48:06.78 --> 00:48:08.78
Yeah, makes sense.

1000
00:48:08.78 --> 00:48:10.78
That's crazy. I didn't know that. That marching thing.

1001
00:48:10.78 --> 00:48:14.78
Like that's why you marched to Kate and so, remember, it's like, so that catapillar

1002
00:48:14.78 --> 00:48:17.78
effects, especially the like shots down the con, actually that's why there's traffic,

1003
00:48:17.78 --> 00:48:18.78
by the way.

1004
00:48:18.78 --> 00:48:21.78
Yes, that's why the traffic exists because of that little effect.

1005
00:48:21.78 --> 00:48:22.78
That's exactly true.

1006
00:48:22.78 --> 00:48:25.78
You know, one guy going in the reaction time.

1007
00:48:25.78 --> 00:48:29.78
You know, the other funny thing he said in here is he says, go watch people dance.

1008
00:48:29.78 --> 00:48:34.78
You see a soldier dance all night, but he can't march for more than an hour without

1009
00:48:34.78 --> 00:48:36.78
an entire Quietz that gives him music.

1010
00:48:36.78 --> 00:48:37.78
I'm funny.

1011
00:48:37.78 --> 00:48:42.78
I didn't want to say that part, but this isn't people start asking me about dancing.

1012
00:48:42.78 --> 00:48:43.78
Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:48:43.78 --> 00:48:47.78
No talk of dance on the podcast.

1014
00:48:47.78 --> 00:48:49.78
Back to the book.

1015
00:48:49.78 --> 00:48:52.78
If the previous war had lasted a little longer,

1016
00:48:52.78 --> 00:48:55.78
indubably everyone would have fought hand to hand.

1017
00:48:55.78 --> 00:48:59.78
This was because the abusive firing began to be appreciated.

1018
00:48:59.78 --> 00:49:03.78
It causes more noise than harm and those who depend on it are always beaten.

1019
00:49:03.78 --> 00:49:05.78
So what do you need?

1020
00:49:05.78 --> 00:49:07.78
I encapsulated a lot of stuff.

1021
00:49:07.78 --> 00:49:12.78
What he was talking about was how everyone was so excited to shoot their rifles.

1022
00:49:12.78 --> 00:49:14.78
And at this time period, the rifles weren't all that accurate.

1023
00:49:14.78 --> 00:49:17.78
And so it was a bunch of noise, but they weren't always that effective.

1024
00:49:17.78 --> 00:49:18.78
And it would be better.

1025
00:49:18.78 --> 00:49:21.78
And by the way, when you had to shoot your rifle, you had to stop.

1026
00:49:21.78 --> 00:49:25.78
So now instead of charging, we're stopping, we're loading, we're firing.

1027
00:49:25.78 --> 00:49:27.78
The other rank is firing.

1028
00:49:27.78 --> 00:49:29.78
And if the other people are moving on you,

1029
00:49:29.78 --> 00:49:33.78
they're going to get close enough and they're going to have no moment.

1030
00:49:33.78 --> 00:49:34.78
They're going to overtake you.

1031
00:49:34.78 --> 00:49:35.78
They're going to overpower you with what?

1032
00:49:35.78 --> 00:49:37.78
With bay and that's in hand to hand combat.

1033
00:49:37.78 --> 00:49:41.78
So what I thought was interesting about this is you say,

1034
00:49:41.78 --> 00:49:45.78
and hey, all this noise, it's basically noise makers.

1035
00:49:45.78 --> 00:49:49.78
For all practical purposes, they're noise makers.

1036
00:49:49.78 --> 00:49:52.78
And he's saying, and what I was thinking was,

1037
00:49:52.78 --> 00:49:57.78
this goes to be, this to me is very similar to people that are yellow.

1038
00:49:57.78 --> 00:50:01.78
Right? You yellow a lot. You were someone that's loud, someone that's always talking to me.

1039
00:50:01.78 --> 00:50:04.78
And he says that people who depend on that are always beaten.

1040
00:50:04.78 --> 00:50:07.78
And I thought to myself, that's a very accurate statement.

1041
00:50:07.78 --> 00:50:10.78
Very accurate statement.

1042
00:50:10.78 --> 00:50:15.78
So don't just talk for the purpose of talking.

1043
00:50:15.78 --> 00:50:18.78
Right? Don't. If you don't have anything to say, that's fine.

1044
00:50:18.78 --> 00:50:21.78
Be quiet. Don't say anything. It's actually good.

1045
00:50:21.78 --> 00:50:22.78
Yep.

1046
00:50:22.78 --> 00:50:30.78
Here he talks about the Roman legions, the Romans vanquished all nations by their discipline.

1047
00:50:30.78 --> 00:50:32.78
No big deal.

1048
00:50:32.78 --> 00:50:37.78
They meditated on war constantly, continually.

1049
00:50:37.78 --> 00:50:43.78
And they always renounced old customs whenever they found better.

1050
00:50:43.78 --> 00:50:46.78
In this respect, they differed from the Gauls,

1051
00:50:46.78 --> 00:50:51.78
whom they defeated during several centuries without the latter thinking of correcting their errors.

1052
00:50:51.78 --> 00:50:54.78
And this is clearly the Romans. Okay.

1053
00:50:54.78 --> 00:50:55.78
We know disciplines important.

1054
00:50:55.78 --> 00:51:03.78
Talk about it all the time. But more important lesson here is they always renounced old customs whenever they found better.

1055
00:51:03.78 --> 00:51:05.78
Boom.

1056
00:51:05.78 --> 00:51:08.78
Renounced the old customs when you find better ones.

1057
00:51:08.78 --> 00:51:10.78
This is something you need to do in your life.

1058
00:51:10.78 --> 00:51:12.78
Something you need to do in your business.

1059
00:51:12.78 --> 00:51:16.78
It's something you need to do on the mat.

1060
00:51:16.78 --> 00:51:18.78
And I'll tell you.

1061
00:51:18.78 --> 00:51:24.78
Going back to the other part, sometimes there's things in Gigiitu that you find a better way.

1062
00:51:24.78 --> 00:51:26.78
And they work for a while.

1063
00:51:26.78 --> 00:51:28.78
And then you go back to the old way.

1064
00:51:28.78 --> 00:51:31.78
And it works because people are expecting the new way.

1065
00:51:31.78 --> 00:51:34.78
The Dean talks to the Dean and say, this is a new old move.

1066
00:51:34.78 --> 00:51:35.78
Yeah.

1067
00:51:35.78 --> 00:51:36.78
You just sent that to you.

1068
00:51:36.78 --> 00:51:38.78
Yeah. This is a new old move.

1069
00:51:38.78 --> 00:51:40.78
It worked 10 years ago.

1070
00:51:40.78 --> 00:51:43.78
It wouldn't work five years ago because everyone knew it.

1071
00:51:43.78 --> 00:51:45.78
Now it'll work again because everyone forgot it.

1072
00:51:45.78 --> 00:51:49.78
Yeah. And that's kind of everyone forgot why we use cadence. Why we use music.

1073
00:51:49.78 --> 00:51:50.78
Yeah.

1074
00:51:50.78 --> 00:51:52.78
We forgot why we don't know how to march now.

1075
00:51:52.78 --> 00:51:53.78
Yeah.

1076
00:51:53.78 --> 00:51:59.78
And it's essentially the same reason why the new move will work because people are unfamiliar.

1077
00:51:59.78 --> 00:52:00.78
Yeah.

1078
00:52:00.78 --> 00:52:03.78
Because you know you have a certain attack or whatever.

1079
00:52:03.78 --> 00:52:07.78
And then the more people know about that attack, the harder it is to be successful with it.

1080
00:52:07.78 --> 00:52:11.78
And then you find some new variation that not everyone knows.

1081
00:52:11.78 --> 00:52:14.78
That's the football game kind of was like that too for a little bit.

1082
00:52:14.78 --> 00:52:23.78
And then after a while, all those fundamentals which work essentially the early version of the move, whatever.

1083
00:52:23.78 --> 00:52:24.78
That's still there.

1084
00:52:24.78 --> 00:52:28.78
But we got this new unrevealed move that's getting everyone because they're unfamiliar.

1085
00:52:28.78 --> 00:52:30.78
It's like a surprise kind of.

1086
00:52:30.78 --> 00:52:30.78
Yeah.

1087
00:52:30.78 --> 00:52:31.78
But they're just unfamiliar.

1088
00:52:31.78 --> 00:52:33.78
And then now everyone gets familiar with it.

1089
00:52:33.78 --> 00:52:35.78
And it's like, cause okay move.

1090
00:52:35.78 --> 00:52:35.78
Yeah.

1091
00:52:35.78 --> 00:52:37.78
But the real good one was that original though.

1092
00:52:37.78 --> 00:52:38.78
G1.

1093
00:52:38.78 --> 00:52:38.78
Yeah.

1094
00:52:38.78 --> 00:52:40.78
But everyone just got used to it.

1095
00:52:40.78 --> 00:52:40.78
Yeah.

1096
00:52:40.78 --> 00:52:43.78
And then once everyone gets used to the new one, they'll get about the old one.

1097
00:52:43.78 --> 00:52:43.78
Yeah.

1098
00:52:43.78 --> 00:52:44.78
Yeah.

1099
00:52:44.78 --> 00:52:45.78
For sure.

1100
00:52:45.78 --> 00:52:50.78
Correct and improve.

1101
00:52:50.78 --> 00:52:53.78
We now to old customs whenever you find better.

1102
00:52:53.78 --> 00:52:58.78
Now he's talking a little bit about peace time.

1103
00:52:58.78 --> 00:53:00.78
And how you maintain your army during peace time.

1104
00:53:00.78 --> 00:53:04.78
He says, as for the cavalry, it should never be touched.

1105
00:53:04.78 --> 00:53:07.78
I mean, you shouldn't get rid of any cavalry people.

1106
00:53:07.78 --> 00:53:10.78
The old troopers and the old horses are the good.

1107
00:53:10.78 --> 00:53:13.78
And the recruits of either are absolutely useless.

1108
00:53:13.78 --> 00:53:17.78
It is a burden and it is an expense, but is indispensable.

1109
00:53:17.78 --> 00:53:25.78
In regard to the infantry, as long as there are few old heads, you can do what you want with the tails.

1110
00:53:25.78 --> 00:53:31.78
So a horseman is you got the skilled horse and you got the skilled horse rider.

1111
00:53:31.78 --> 00:53:36.78
And he says in this, I don't know if I'll read it, but he says also in here takes ten years to make a good.

1112
00:53:36.78 --> 00:53:41.78
A good cavalryman, good guy that's really good on the horse with a really good horse takes ten years to make them.

1113
00:53:41.78 --> 00:53:43.78
So you can't just get rid of that person.

1114
00:53:43.78 --> 00:53:47.78
But an infantryman, if you got some good, this is what I like about it.

1115
00:53:47.78 --> 00:53:53.78
If you've got good leadership, good leadership with infantrymen, hey man, there's some fundamental skills you're going to need to learn.

1116
00:53:53.78 --> 00:53:57.78
It will be ready to rock and roll, which is awesome.

1117
00:53:57.78 --> 00:53:59.78
Good leadership goes a long way.

1118
00:53:59.78 --> 00:54:07.78
I mean, and again, you have to have, it takes a lot of takes the same amount of time to make a good infantry leader.

1119
00:54:07.78 --> 00:54:12.78
Because those are skills that take a long time to develop, they become a leader of infantry troops.

1120
00:54:12.78 --> 00:54:17.78
But your basic combat riflemen, you can make them pretty quick.

1121
00:54:17.78 --> 00:54:22.78
Not like it's a hell of a lot easier than making someone that can ride a horse.

1122
00:54:22.78 --> 00:54:28.78
So, and then your leadership's going to go a long way.

1123
00:54:28.78 --> 00:54:37.78
Back to the book, in attacking infantry, the two rear ranks are to lower their pikes.

1124
00:54:37.78 --> 00:54:42.78
In this position, the pikes will extend from six to seven feet ahead of the front rank.

1125
00:54:42.78 --> 00:54:50.78
The front ranks being sheltered in such a manner will, I am sure, aim with more confidence than if they had nothing in front of them.

1126
00:54:50.78 --> 00:54:56.78
Besides this, the third rank can ward off blows and defend the first rank,

1127
00:54:56.78 --> 00:55:01.78
which will do much better since it is covered by the first two ranks.

1128
00:55:01.78 --> 00:55:12.78
The second rank, which is armed with muskets, can fire and defend the man in front of him in the first rank without the latter being obliged to stoop.

1129
00:55:12.78 --> 00:55:17.78
This avoids a serious disadvantage, which is incurred in kneeling a dangerous movement,

1130
00:55:17.78 --> 00:55:27.78
because men who are afraid prefer this position, they cannot be made to get up and is always necessary to halt to kneel.

1131
00:55:27.78 --> 00:55:36.78
According to my formation, all the men are covered each by each other with reciprocal confidence.

1132
00:55:36.78 --> 00:55:44.78
The front presents a forest of spears that are parents is formidable and gives confidence to your own troops because they feel it's power.

1133
00:55:44.78 --> 00:55:56.78
So, a couple of interesting things are obviously to cover move situation and we're going to work that out, but I thought beyond that it was interesting that if you're going to take a knee,

1134
00:55:56.78 --> 00:56:02.78
well there's two things that are happening. Number one, you have to stop to take a knee. We're not advancing on our knees.

1135
00:56:02.78 --> 00:56:08.78
And number two, people in a fray, they want to be down there. It's going to be hard to get him back up, so don't even let him get down there.

1136
00:56:08.78 --> 00:56:11.78
Keep that momentum going.

1137
00:56:11.78 --> 00:56:15.78
We're looking to keep that momentum going.

1138
00:56:15.78 --> 00:56:22.78
Back to the book, those who imagine that, and I think I state this every time usually around this point in the podcast,

1139
00:56:22.78 --> 00:56:27.78
I'm skipping a lot of the book. It's just the way it is. We're not going to read the whole book on here.

1140
00:56:27.78 --> 00:56:32.78
You have to order it yourself if you want to hear every secret of sex.

1141
00:56:32.78 --> 00:56:42.78
Those who imagine that the Roman legions were composed of Romans from Rome are very much deceived. They came from all the nations in the world,

1142
00:56:42.78 --> 00:56:49.78
but their composition, their discipline, and their methods of fighting were better than all those other nations.

1143
00:56:49.78 --> 00:56:51.78
This is why they conquered them all.

1144
00:56:51.78 --> 00:57:01.78
Neither were they conquered in their turn until this discipline had to generate it among the Romans.

1145
00:57:01.78 --> 00:57:09.78
Discipline will get you a long way and lack of discipline will get you killed, disintegrated.

1146
00:57:09.78 --> 00:57:10.78
It disintegrated.

1147
00:57:10.78 --> 00:57:18.78
Talking more about cavalry here, the cavalry should be active and mounted on horses in nerd to fatigue.

1148
00:57:18.78 --> 00:57:28.78
It should be encumbered with as little baggage as possible, and above all should not make the common error of having fat horses.

1149
00:57:28.78 --> 00:57:36.78
If they could see an enemy every day it would only be better for this would soon put them in condition to attempt anything.

1150
00:57:36.78 --> 00:57:45.78
It is certain that the power of cavalry is not understood why, because of we have love for fat horses.

1151
00:57:45.78 --> 00:57:52.78
I had a regiment of German cavalry in Poland, with which I marched more than 1,500 leagues in 18 months.

1152
00:57:52.78 --> 00:58:01.78
I maintained that this regiment was more fit for service at the end of this time than another supplied with fat horses.

1153
00:58:01.78 --> 00:58:10.78
But to reach this condition they must be gradually accustomed to hardship and hardened by hunts and violent exercise.

1154
00:58:10.78 --> 00:58:21.78
This will maintain their health and increase their endurance, likewise it will make cavalrymen of the troopers and give them a martial bearing.

1155
00:58:21.78 --> 00:58:24.78
So you got to train hard.

1156
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:27.78
I just read all that to basically say you got to train hard.

1157
00:58:27.78 --> 00:58:30.78
You're going to be ready to fight, you got to train how you fight.

1158
00:58:30.78 --> 00:58:34.78
And don't get on a fat horse apparently.

1159
00:58:34.78 --> 00:58:38.78
I have to ask my wife about that once she knows more about horses than me or life.

1160
00:58:38.78 --> 00:58:39.78
Sure.

1161
00:58:39.78 --> 00:58:41.78
Life knows about horses, he's from Texas.

1162
00:58:41.78 --> 00:58:44.78
Everyone from Texas ride to horse.

1163
00:58:44.78 --> 00:58:45.78
Is that the image?

1164
00:58:45.78 --> 00:58:46.78
Yes.

1165
00:58:46.78 --> 00:58:52.78
When I would go overseas, people from everyone in America is basically carrying a pistol on them at all times.

1166
00:58:52.78 --> 00:58:55.78
That's the image that people have of America.

1167
00:58:55.78 --> 00:58:58.78
I like that image for people that have America too.

1168
00:58:58.78 --> 00:59:04.78
I mean, I'm certain people don't like that image, but, yeah, you know, be nice when you come here.

1169
00:59:04.78 --> 00:59:06.78
You can want to come and visit that school.

1170
00:59:06.78 --> 00:59:07.78
We welcome visitors.

1171
00:59:07.78 --> 00:59:08.78
Just be nice.

1172
00:59:08.78 --> 00:59:11.78
Everyone's carrying a 45 in their back pocket.

1173
00:59:11.78 --> 00:59:14.78
Yeah.

1174
00:59:14.78 --> 00:59:17.78
Can you carry a 45 in your back pocket?

1175
00:59:17.78 --> 00:59:18.78
You could.

1176
00:59:18.78 --> 00:59:20.78
Would it recommend it?

1177
00:59:20.78 --> 00:59:21.78
No, wouldn't recommend it.

1178
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:22.78
You get a holster.

1179
00:59:22.78 --> 00:59:23.78
Yeah, yeah.

1180
00:59:23.78 --> 00:59:24.78
So back.

1181
00:59:24.78 --> 00:59:25.78
But it's more of an expression.

1182
00:59:25.78 --> 00:59:26.78
No, no, it's not even expression.

1183
00:59:26.78 --> 00:59:31.78
But if you go to another country, they think that we've just got them in our back pocket.

1184
00:59:31.78 --> 00:59:32.78
Yeah.

1185
00:59:32.78 --> 00:59:33.78
Like you carry a wallet in a 45.

1186
00:59:33.78 --> 00:59:34.78
Yeah.

1187
00:59:34.78 --> 00:59:35.78
What?

1188
00:59:35.78 --> 00:59:36.78
Next question.

1189
00:59:36.78 --> 00:59:38.78
You see what I'm going from here?

1190
00:59:38.78 --> 00:59:39.78
Yes.

1191
00:59:39.78 --> 00:59:42.78
So we roll in America.

1192
00:59:42.78 --> 00:59:44.78
I do not back to the book.

1193
00:59:44.78 --> 00:59:52.78
I do not know why armor has been laid aside for nothing is either so useful or ornamental.

1194
00:59:52.78 --> 01:00:01.78
If it be considered how many troopers perished by the sword and how many are, how many many are dangerously wounded by random and weak shots,

1195
01:00:01.78 --> 01:00:09.78
accident against which armor guarantees protection, one cannot avoid acknowledging the benefits of it.

1196
01:00:09.78 --> 01:00:16.78
It is nothing but indulence and relaxation of discipline that caused it to be laid aside.

1197
01:00:16.78 --> 01:00:27.78
It is worrisome to carry a queer ass and a trail pike and trail a pike half a century to use it a single day.

1198
01:00:27.78 --> 01:00:34.78
But as soon as discipline is neglected in a nation as soon as comfort becomes an aim,

1199
01:00:34.78 --> 01:00:41.78
it needs no inspiration to fratell that ruin is near.

1200
01:00:41.78 --> 01:00:45.78
The Romans conquered all peoples by their discipline.

1201
01:00:45.78 --> 01:01:01.78
In the measure that it became corrupted, their success decreased when the emperor aggression permitted the legions to quit their curasses and helmets because the soldiers complained they were too heavy,

1202
01:01:01.78 --> 01:01:08.78
they were always lost, the ballbarians who they had defeated during so many centuries, vanquished them.

1203
01:01:08.78 --> 01:01:10.78
That's all.

1204
01:01:10.78 --> 01:01:14.78
That's all people stop wearing their armor because it's heavy.

1205
01:01:14.78 --> 01:01:17.78
Body armor is heavy.

1206
01:01:17.78 --> 01:01:19.78
Your helmet is heavy.

1207
01:01:19.78 --> 01:01:22.78
You want that little tiny helmet?

1208
01:01:22.78 --> 01:01:32.78
You want the back plate of our body armor?

1209
01:01:32.78 --> 01:01:35.78
You want that?

1210
01:01:35.78 --> 01:01:37.78
You want that?

1211
01:01:37.78 --> 01:01:39.78
Yeah, because they were like dang.

1212
01:01:39.78 --> 01:01:41.78
Yeah, we're not going to happen.

1213
01:01:41.78 --> 01:01:43.78
We like maneuverable.

1214
01:01:43.78 --> 01:01:45.78
That's the thing you say.

1215
01:01:45.78 --> 01:01:46.78
Yeah.

1216
01:01:46.78 --> 01:01:49.78
It's like skipping your work out and saying, well, I need to rest it.

1217
01:01:49.78 --> 01:01:53.78
Kind of the same thing.

1218
01:01:53.78 --> 01:01:54.78
Very similar.

1219
01:01:54.78 --> 01:02:02.78
Yeah, obviously as soon as discipline is neglected in a nation, guess what's the same thing with your personal life?

1220
01:02:02.78 --> 01:02:05.78
Obviously.

1221
01:02:05.78 --> 01:02:14.78
Back to the book, the troopers should have a goat skin bottle like those used in hauntries instead of a cantine or a barrel to hold liquor's in.

1222
01:02:14.78 --> 01:02:25.78
This with his linen stockings cap and cord and a few other necessities to be put in the bottom of the sack, which will roll up with his coat and can be fastened with two straps behind him.

1223
01:02:25.78 --> 01:02:29.78
This will reduce the monstrous load which is now carried by the cavalry.

1224
01:02:29.78 --> 01:02:36.78
It is necessary from time to time to inspect the baggage and force the men to throw away useless items.

1225
01:02:36.78 --> 01:02:37.78
I have frequently done it.

1226
01:02:37.78 --> 01:02:41.78
One can hardly imagine all the trash they carry with them year after year.

1227
01:02:41.78 --> 01:02:52.78
The poor horse has to carry everything. It is no exaggeration to say that I have filled 20 wagons with useless rubbish, which I have found in the review of a single regimen.

1228
01:02:52.78 --> 01:02:56.78
So people will tend to carry a lot.

1229
01:02:56.78 --> 01:02:59.78
A lot that they don't need.

1230
01:02:59.78 --> 01:03:01.78
And that weighs down on you.

1231
01:03:01.78 --> 01:03:09.78
I think I've talked about this before, but the back in the park and the do we had these winter pool tunes, which I never did one out on the east coast.

1232
01:03:09.78 --> 01:03:11.78
These winter pool tunes.

1233
01:03:11.78 --> 01:03:16.78
And you are going long distance on cross country skis.

1234
01:03:16.78 --> 01:03:20.78
You know those are long long distances.

1235
01:03:20.78 --> 01:03:23.78
You are basically running a marathon.

1236
01:03:23.78 --> 01:03:28.78
And so the guys were super anal about the weight that they carried.

1237
01:03:28.78 --> 01:03:34.78
So they would, you know the backpack has a strap that you pull, you pull the tight.

1238
01:03:34.78 --> 01:03:39.78
And then they get it to the port where it was supposed to be. Give it a little bit of a second and cut the rest off and sew it.

1239
01:03:39.78 --> 01:03:42.78
So they don't want to carry that little extra 4 inches of nylon.

1240
01:03:42.78 --> 01:03:43.78
Not going to do it.

1241
01:03:43.78 --> 01:03:46.78
They had every piece of gear that they had would be like that.

1242
01:03:46.78 --> 01:03:51.78
The winter warriors, a team to pro-cada-tune.

1243
01:03:51.78 --> 01:03:53.78
Here's an interesting thing.

1244
01:03:53.78 --> 01:03:57.78
In passing through water, the horses must never be allowed to drink.

1245
01:03:57.78 --> 01:04:01.78
A man who holds the water as horse will stop a whole army.

1246
01:04:01.78 --> 01:04:04.78
When this happens, the officers should hasten to the spot.

1247
01:04:04.78 --> 01:04:11.78
And instead of fruitless reprimands and ill-timed mercy, they should instantly chastize the offender.

1248
01:04:11.78 --> 01:04:16.78
Nothing is of such importance for the preservation of the cavalry.

1249
01:04:16.78 --> 01:04:20.78
Otherwise, the affection, the men they have for their horses,

1250
01:04:20.78 --> 01:04:23.78
will have them halting, little or much.

1251
01:04:23.78 --> 01:04:29.78
And then it is impossible for them to recover their ranks without galloping.

1252
01:04:29.78 --> 01:04:32.78
Discipline.

1253
01:04:32.78 --> 01:04:35.78
People get that little affection for their, not just, you know,

1254
01:04:35.78 --> 01:04:40.78
I was thinking horses are I was thinking about being on a long patrol or in the workplace.

1255
01:04:40.78 --> 01:04:42.78
You want your team to go.

1256
01:04:42.78 --> 01:04:47.78
And every time you grant that little bit of mercy, right?

1257
01:04:47.78 --> 01:04:49.78
Am I saying be merciless, Raver?

1258
01:04:49.78 --> 01:04:54.78
No, but when you do it, you start to develop that trend and now it throws other things off.

1259
01:04:54.78 --> 01:04:57.78
Sometimes you just got to be, hey, no, be quiet and execute.

1260
01:04:57.78 --> 01:05:00.78
Yeah, got to go.

1261
01:05:00.78 --> 01:05:03.78
Got to go.

1262
01:05:03.78 --> 01:05:07.78
In time of peace and in winter, quarters in time of war,

1263
01:05:07.78 --> 01:05:12.78
their horses should be kept in condition by violent exercise or runs at least three times a week.

1264
01:05:12.78 --> 01:05:14.78
I like this idea of violent exercise.

1265
01:05:14.78 --> 01:05:17.78
I'm going to start doing more violent exercise.

1266
01:05:17.78 --> 01:05:19.78
Yeah, that's good.

1267
01:05:19.78 --> 01:05:21.78
Like violent exercising.

1268
01:05:21.78 --> 01:05:28.78
The same severe usage is also proper for the heavy cavalry charge at those times.

1269
01:05:28.78 --> 01:05:29.78
It is in the field.

1270
01:05:29.78 --> 01:05:37.78
It is only in the field that they must be managed carefully to keep them in flesh and the squadrons complete and strong.

1271
01:05:37.78 --> 01:05:39.78
And this is interesting.

1272
01:05:39.78 --> 01:05:45.78
The best chance of teaching them to stand fire is when the infantry is practicing.

1273
01:05:45.78 --> 01:05:49.78
They should advance on the fire and walk.

1274
01:05:49.78 --> 01:05:54.78
And be kept calm, accustomed, accustomed them to go closer and closer.

1275
01:05:54.78 --> 01:05:58.78
They should never be beaten but stroked and encouraged.

1276
01:05:58.78 --> 01:06:00.78
Encouraged in the space of a month.

1277
01:06:00.78 --> 01:06:08.78
They will be so accustomed to it that they will even put their nose on the muscle of the muskets without any fright or surprise.

1278
01:06:08.78 --> 01:06:09.78
Then they are all right.

1279
01:06:09.78 --> 01:06:13.78
Nevertheless, they should not be allowed to approach too close for once.

1280
01:06:13.78 --> 01:06:14.78
They get burned.

1281
01:06:14.78 --> 01:06:16.78
You will not be able to bring them near again.

1282
01:06:16.78 --> 01:06:20.78
This ordeal must be reserved for the day of battle.

1283
01:06:20.78 --> 01:06:21.78
That was good.

1284
01:06:21.78 --> 01:06:27.78
That to me reminded me of what Jordan Peterson was talking about and where the warrior kid, how you slowly

1285
01:06:27.78 --> 01:06:28.78
and accumulate people.

1286
01:06:28.78 --> 01:06:34.78
You don't throw them into the, you don't bring them right up to the firing line and start shooting the guns and let them get freaked out horribly.

1287
01:06:34.78 --> 01:06:36.78
You bring them a little distance.

1288
01:06:36.78 --> 01:06:37.78
You let them listen from afar.

1289
01:06:37.78 --> 01:06:40.78
And then we'll make closer and next thing you know they're good to go.

1290
01:06:40.78 --> 01:06:41.78
They're standing in line.

1291
01:06:41.78 --> 01:06:42.78
What do you call that?

1292
01:06:42.78 --> 01:06:44.78
What did Jordan Peterson call that?

1293
01:06:44.78 --> 01:06:45.78
Exposure.

1294
01:06:45.78 --> 01:06:46.78
Yeah, great.

1295
01:06:46.78 --> 01:06:47.78
Exposure therapy.

1296
01:06:47.78 --> 01:06:48.78
Exposure.

1297
01:06:48.78 --> 01:06:49.78
Yeah.

1298
01:06:49.78 --> 01:06:50.78
Graduated.

1299
01:06:50.78 --> 01:06:51.78
Exposure therapy.

1300
01:06:51.78 --> 01:06:52.78
Something.

1301
01:06:52.78 --> 01:06:53.78
Something.

1302
01:06:53.78 --> 01:06:54.78
Something like that.

1303
01:06:54.78 --> 01:06:56.78
I'm telling you.

1304
01:06:56.78 --> 01:06:57.78
Cover move.

1305
01:06:57.78 --> 01:06:58.78
A little bit of that.

1306
01:06:58.78 --> 01:07:03.78
I am convinced every unit that is not supported is a defeated organization.

1307
01:07:03.78 --> 01:07:09.78
Infantry should always be supported by cavalry and cavalry by infantry.

1308
01:07:09.78 --> 01:07:11.78
Cover move.

1309
01:07:11.78 --> 01:07:13.78
Work together.

1310
01:07:13.78 --> 01:07:14.78
Support.

1311
01:07:14.78 --> 01:07:16.78
Here's a little note.

1312
01:07:16.78 --> 01:07:17.78
Back to the book.

1313
01:07:17.78 --> 01:07:24.78
The general or commander in chief of an army should have a standard to be carried ahead of him as a mark of his rank.

1314
01:07:24.78 --> 01:07:27.78
So he's talking about flags.

1315
01:07:27.78 --> 01:07:29.78
This is this also has a purpose.

1316
01:07:29.78 --> 01:07:33.78
Anyone searching for him will know instantly where to find him, especially in battle.

1317
01:07:33.78 --> 01:07:38.78
I'm the troops seeing the standard will know that the general is observing them.

1318
01:07:38.78 --> 01:07:41.78
So one thing we did.

1319
01:07:41.78 --> 01:07:45.78
And they do in the military is they you when you're giving your brief on how the mission is going to go.

1320
01:07:45.78 --> 01:07:47.78
Your brief location of leadership.

1321
01:07:47.78 --> 01:07:49.78
There's a guys we're going to take down these eight buildings.

1322
01:07:49.78 --> 01:07:52.78
I'll be here in this building on the top floor.

1323
01:07:52.78 --> 01:07:53.78
Boom.

1324
01:07:53.78 --> 01:07:54.78
So if you need me, no order to come find me.

1325
01:07:54.78 --> 01:07:55.78
So it happens.

1326
01:07:55.78 --> 01:07:57.78
Hey, where's this platoon leader going to be?

1327
01:07:57.78 --> 01:07:58.78
Yep.

1328
01:07:58.78 --> 01:07:59.78
Once we get our targets here, I'm going to come over here.

1329
01:07:59.78 --> 01:08:01.78
I'm going to stay on the backside with a breach took place if you need me.

1330
01:08:01.78 --> 01:08:02.78
That's where I'll be.

1331
01:08:02.78 --> 01:08:03.78
So everyone's got to know where everyone is.

1332
01:08:03.78 --> 01:08:07.78
And you see talking about like having a standard that's like a symbol.

1333
01:08:07.78 --> 01:08:08.78
It's a flag.

1334
01:08:08.78 --> 01:08:09.78
Yeah.

1335
01:08:09.78 --> 01:08:10.78
Yeah.

1336
01:08:10.78 --> 01:08:11.78
And actual flags.

1337
01:08:11.78 --> 01:08:12.78
You don't really want to do that.

1338
01:08:12.78 --> 01:08:14.78
Because isn't there like a thing?

1339
01:08:14.78 --> 01:08:15.78
Yes.

1340
01:08:15.78 --> 01:08:19.78
That's saying like, hey, you don't want it like I, what was it?

1341
01:08:19.78 --> 01:08:20.78
I don't say Stephen Primer.

1342
01:08:20.78 --> 01:08:21.78
I ain't like don't salute.

1343
01:08:21.78 --> 01:08:22.78
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

1344
01:08:22.78 --> 01:08:24.78
Because I don't want to enemy to see where.

1345
01:08:24.78 --> 01:08:29.78
Yeah, you definitely don't want to mark your position.

1346
01:08:29.78 --> 01:08:30.78
Right.

1347
01:08:30.78 --> 01:08:32.78
Like, yeah, well, these guys are doing their own things.

1348
01:08:32.78 --> 01:08:37.78
And as a matter of fact, and I'm trying to think of what book we recently did where he was talking about.

1349
01:08:37.78 --> 01:08:44.78
Like, yeah, if you're seen running around, if you're a radio man or you're seen running around giving direction, you're going to get shot.

1350
01:08:44.78 --> 01:08:45.78
Yeah.

1351
01:08:45.78 --> 01:08:45.78
Yeah.

1352
01:08:45.78 --> 01:08:45.78
Yeah.

1353
01:08:45.78 --> 01:08:50.78
The officer that I think it was, I think it was, I think it was the battle line drink.

1354
01:08:50.78 --> 01:08:52.78
But yeah, they're talking about that.

1355
01:08:52.78 --> 01:08:53.78
Oh, yeah.

1356
01:08:53.78 --> 01:08:54.78
It definitely was the battle line drink.

1357
01:08:54.78 --> 01:08:58.78
It was because when they were leaving, they said like within within minutes, the leaders had been killed.

1358
01:08:58.78 --> 01:08:59.78
Yeah.

1359
01:08:59.78 --> 01:09:00.78
The radio man had been killed.

1360
01:09:00.78 --> 01:09:02.78
The ones that were still with their elements.

1361
01:09:02.78 --> 01:09:04.78
So yeah, that's not something you want to do.

1362
01:09:04.78 --> 01:09:07.78
But what we would do is brief where we're going to be.

1363
01:09:07.78 --> 01:09:12.78
So that everyone on the team knew based on a terrain feature.

1364
01:09:12.78 --> 01:09:12.78
Yeah.

1365
01:09:12.78 --> 01:09:18.78
You know, hey, here's this building or here's this null of this mountain or here's this intersection is road.

1366
01:09:18.78 --> 01:09:19.78
That's where I'll be.

1367
01:09:19.78 --> 01:09:21.78
That's where I'm, that's where I'm planning to be.

1368
01:09:21.78 --> 01:09:22.78
So now people know where you are.

1369
01:09:22.78 --> 01:09:23.78
Yeah.

1370
01:09:23.78 --> 01:09:24.78
Makes sense.

1371
01:09:24.78 --> 01:09:30.78
I mean, he had an additional thing there when he said, so that you know the general's watching.

1372
01:09:30.78 --> 01:09:34.78
Kind of thing, I guess that wouldn't really apply to your situation.

1373
01:09:34.78 --> 01:09:35.78
No, no, yeah.

1374
01:09:35.78 --> 01:09:36.78
It wouldn't apply.

1375
01:09:36.78 --> 01:09:43.78
Although, like in the military, when the general is visiting and as a two star general, they raise a two star flag.

1376
01:09:43.78 --> 01:09:44.78
Yeah.

1377
01:09:44.78 --> 01:09:45.78
So there it is.

1378
01:09:45.78 --> 01:09:46.78
Yeah.

1379
01:09:46.78 --> 01:09:46.78
Yeah.

1380
01:09:46.78 --> 01:09:47.78
So okay.

1381
01:09:47.78 --> 01:09:48.78
So I guess yeah, you're right.

1382
01:09:48.78 --> 01:09:51.78
So it'll be real circumstantial like during the war.

1383
01:09:51.78 --> 01:09:52.78
Yeah.

1384
01:09:52.78 --> 01:09:53.78
You're not that old.

1385
01:09:53.78 --> 01:09:54.78
You're not doing that.

1386
01:09:54.78 --> 01:09:55.78
Yeah.

1387
01:09:55.78 --> 01:09:58.78
Now we talked about the companies.

1388
01:09:58.78 --> 01:10:04.78
And again, he calls them centuries, which is basically a company sized element of around a hundred guys.

1389
01:10:04.78 --> 01:10:10.78
And he's saying that they should have their own little symbols as well and their own standards.

1390
01:10:10.78 --> 01:10:11.78
Back to the book.

1391
01:10:11.78 --> 01:10:16.78
If the standards are distinguished by their different colors, the actions of every century will be conspicuous.

1392
01:10:16.78 --> 01:10:22.78
This will create the greatest emulation because both officers and soldiers will know that they are seen.

1393
01:10:22.78 --> 01:10:27.78
And that their countenance conduct and behavior are not ignored by the rest of the army.

1394
01:10:27.78 --> 01:10:37.78
The man as well as the officers will tell of it in the field and in garrison, their exploits will be constant, the constant subject of conversation.

1395
01:10:37.78 --> 01:10:40.78
I thought that was kind of a cool idea.

1396
01:10:40.78 --> 01:10:45.78
You know, if you're, if you're flying the flag, then people are watching you.

1397
01:10:45.78 --> 01:10:46.78
And so you better act.

1398
01:10:46.78 --> 01:10:47.78
You better come correct.

1399
01:10:47.78 --> 01:10:48.78
It represents.

1400
01:10:48.78 --> 01:10:48.78
Yeah.

1401
01:10:48.78 --> 01:10:49.78
You better represent.

1402
01:10:49.78 --> 01:10:50.78
Actually, I like come correct.

1403
01:10:50.78 --> 01:10:51.78
There's a, come correct.

1404
01:10:51.78 --> 01:10:51.78
Yeah.

1405
01:10:51.78 --> 01:10:52.78
Come correct.

1406
01:10:52.78 --> 01:10:53.78
Hmm.

1407
01:10:53.78 --> 01:10:54.78
Hmm.

1408
01:10:54.78 --> 01:10:57.78
Back to the book.

1409
01:10:57.78 --> 01:11:03.78
After the organization of military troops, military discipline is the first matter that presents itself.

1410
01:11:03.78 --> 01:11:06.78
It is the soul of armies.

1411
01:11:06.78 --> 01:11:07.78
Hmm.

1412
01:11:07.78 --> 01:11:10.78
That is such a nice ring to it.

1413
01:11:10.78 --> 01:11:16.78
It's the soul of the individual as well, but I suppose we'll talk about that later.

1414
01:11:16.78 --> 01:11:17.78
Back to the book.

1415
01:11:17.78 --> 01:11:23.78
If it is not established with wisdom and maintained with unshakable resolution, you'll have no soldiers.

1416
01:11:23.78 --> 01:11:31.78
Regiments and armies will be only contemptible, armed mobs, more dangerous to their own country than the enemy.

1417
01:11:31.78 --> 01:11:39.78
It is a false idea that discipline, subordination, and slaveish obedience, debase, courage.

1418
01:11:39.78 --> 01:11:48.78
It has always been noted that it is with those armies in which the severest discipline is enforced, that the greatest deeds are performed.

1419
01:11:48.78 --> 01:11:58.78
Many generals believe that they have done everything as soon as they have issued orders and that they are, and they order a great deal because they find many abuses.

1420
01:11:58.78 --> 01:12:07.78
So he's saying they're like, when a general feels like, they talk about a bad general, when a general feels like they've done everything as soon as they've given their order.

1421
01:12:07.78 --> 01:12:10.78
And since that's what they do, they give all kinds of orders.

1422
01:12:10.78 --> 01:12:11.78
I'm not order you to do this anymore.

1423
01:12:11.78 --> 01:12:12.78
Or do you do that?

1424
01:12:12.78 --> 01:12:13.78
I'm not order you to use something else.

1425
01:12:13.78 --> 01:12:14.78
Here's what he says.

1426
01:12:14.78 --> 01:12:17.78
This is a false principle.

1427
01:12:17.78 --> 01:12:24.78
Proceeding in this fashion, they will never reestablish discipline in an army in which it has been lost or weakened.

1428
01:12:24.78 --> 01:12:28.78
Few orders are best.

1429
01:12:28.78 --> 01:12:32.78
But they should be followed up with care.

1430
01:12:32.78 --> 01:12:42.78
Negligence should be punished without partiality and without distinction of rank or birth otherwise you will make yourself hated.

1431
01:12:42.78 --> 01:12:46.78
One can be exact and just.

1432
01:12:46.78 --> 01:12:49.78
And beloved at the same time is feared.

1433
01:12:49.78 --> 01:12:58.78
Severity must be accompanied with kindness, but this should not have the appearance of pretense, but of goodness.

1434
01:12:58.78 --> 01:13:01.78
And this is just a little note I thought everyone should know.

1435
01:13:01.78 --> 01:13:04.78
Whippings need not be severe.

1436
01:13:04.78 --> 01:13:12.78
The more moderate they are, the more quickly will abuse is be remedied since all the world will join in ending them.

1437
01:13:12.78 --> 01:13:20.78
So even when you're whipping your people, you know, be a little bit more judicious.

1438
01:13:20.78 --> 01:13:23.78
We have a, this is, this is good too.

1439
01:13:23.78 --> 01:13:29.78
We have a pernacious custom in France of always punishing with death.

1440
01:13:29.78 --> 01:13:32.78
A soldier called pillaging is hunger.

1441
01:13:32.78 --> 01:13:35.78
The result, now what do you think the result of that would be that he's going to say?

1442
01:13:35.78 --> 01:13:36.78
I'm quizzing you.

1443
01:13:36.78 --> 01:13:38.78
Which you're saying, somebody?

1444
01:13:38.78 --> 01:13:43.78
If you, if you are pillaging, compilaging, you're going to get hung.

1445
01:13:43.78 --> 01:13:47.78
What do you think the, what do you think it happens because that happens to who?

1446
01:13:47.78 --> 01:13:51.78
What do you think, do you think, do you think, why should we not hang people for pillaging?

1447
01:13:51.78 --> 01:13:57.78
Do you think there's a lot of pillaging going on if you get caught pillaging, they hang you or your fellow soldiers?

1448
01:13:57.78 --> 01:13:58.78
Do you think they pillage?

1449
01:13:58.78 --> 01:13:59.78
I say no.

1450
01:13:59.78 --> 01:13:59.78
Okay.

1451
01:13:59.78 --> 01:14:00.78
You're wrong.

1452
01:14:00.78 --> 01:14:08.76
The result is that no one arrest him because they do not want to cause the death of a poor devil who is only trying to

1453
01:14:08.76 --> 01:14:09.76
live.

1454
01:14:09.76 --> 01:14:13.76
If instead we were only turned him over to the guard to be put in chains and can have to

1455
01:14:13.76 --> 01:14:21.76
bread and water for one to three months or put to work in at any of the labors that always have to be done in any army.

1456
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:29.76
And then they were sent to his regiment before a battle or when the general wished, everyone would agree with this punishment and the officers of the patrols would arrest them by the hundreds.

1457
01:14:29.76 --> 01:14:34.76
Soon there would be no pillaging because everyone would join in putting it under control.

1458
01:14:34.76 --> 01:14:35.76
So, that makes sense.

1459
01:14:35.76 --> 01:14:39.76
Yeah, that is.

1460
01:14:39.76 --> 01:14:40.76
The reason I asked you that which I don't normally do is because I thought the same thing.

1461
01:14:40.76 --> 01:14:42.76
I was like, oh, where's he going with this?

1462
01:14:42.76 --> 01:14:43.76
Oh, yeah, it's obvious.

1463
01:14:43.76 --> 01:14:48.76
Once you think about it, you're not going to report one of your guys for stealing something if the punishment was death.

1464
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:50.76
But you know what that is?

1465
01:14:50.76 --> 01:14:52.76
That's like small picture versus big pictures.

1466
01:14:52.76 --> 01:14:56.76
Small picture is like, yeah, because you just look at it as yourself.

1467
01:14:56.76 --> 01:14:58.76
You get your bubble in your head.

1468
01:14:58.76 --> 01:15:01.76
I wouldn't pillage if it was death.

1469
01:15:01.76 --> 01:15:02.76
I wouldn't pillage.

1470
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:06.76
You're looking at it, but no, big picture is like, apply that to everyone.

1471
01:15:06.76 --> 01:15:08.76
I'll apply it to the whole community.

1472
01:15:08.76 --> 01:15:09.76
Exactly right.

1473
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:12.76
If you tell on this guy pillaging, you just sent his team to death.

1474
01:15:12.76 --> 01:15:15.76
If you tell on him, maybe you turn him in and whatever that's what you did.

1475
01:15:15.76 --> 01:15:16.76
Good point.

1476
01:15:16.76 --> 01:15:22.76
And I just remembered somebody pointed out to me, you remember rifleman Harris and it starts off when my rifleman Harris asked to execute a guy.

1477
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:29.76
And I said, I said on the podcast, hey, this guy is getting executed basically for

1478
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:37.76
deserves and being drunk. What I didn't realize is it's somebody sent me an email or a social media message.

1479
01:15:37.76 --> 01:15:43.76
They said, hey, the reason that guy was getting executed was because he had taken the money for like 16

1480
01:15:43.76 --> 01:15:46.76
Enlistments and kept disappearing.

1481
01:15:46.76 --> 01:15:52.76
So when you get a signing bonus, hey, here's here's, here's, there's probably nothing, but you know, here's here's 10

1482
01:15:52.76 --> 01:15:59.76
or 10, 10, quit or pound sterling or whatever. Here's 10 pounds sterling. Oh, you're joining the army. Cool. Here's 10 and then you take that money.

1483
01:15:59.76 --> 01:16:01.76
Go get drunk and get crazy.

1484
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:04.76
And then you do it again. And then you do it again in a different area because they have no internet.

1485
01:16:04.76 --> 01:16:08.76
They have no way of knowing that this is the guy when they finally catch him. He's getting sent to death.

1486
01:16:08.76 --> 01:16:10.76
Now, do I think you should get sent to death, even for that?

1487
01:16:10.76 --> 01:16:11.76
Not really.

1488
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:15.76
But he was doing something more severe than what I had mentioned on the podcast.

1489
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:19.76
So I just wanted to, while I'm thinking about that set the record straight.

1490
01:16:19.76 --> 01:16:32.76
But the main point here for me is the secondary effects, right? You think you're going to have the primary effect is, oh, if we do this, no one's going to, if we're going to kill you, if you get caught pillaging, no one's going to, no one's going to pillage anymore.

1491
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:37.76
No, actually no one's going to report it anymore because your punishment is too strong.

1492
01:16:37.76 --> 01:16:45.76
This is also how this is also how and why when people think that, oh, if someone's in the military, the soldiers just do it, they're told wrong.

1493
01:16:45.76 --> 01:16:51.76
The soldiers actually, they're secondary effects. Oh, you're going to kill the guys, no, we're not going to report it then.

1494
01:16:51.76 --> 01:16:56.76
Yeah. So there's secondary effects, even though they've been ordered to do that and their soldiers now have discipline. They've been trained.

1495
01:16:56.76 --> 01:17:00.76
He's bragging about discipline all the time. Guess what? They don't call that order because the order sucks.

1496
01:17:00.76 --> 01:17:03.76
And that's what we got to remember. Not just about the military, but about business too.

1497
01:17:03.76 --> 01:17:09.76
You give people dumb orders or you give people things that don't make sense. They're not really going to execute it the way you'd want them to.

1498
01:17:09.76 --> 01:17:18.76
And I'll tell you something else, you don't want them to execute that way because if they got hundreds of people pillaging and you now end up murdering hundreds of own your own people, you're affecting your own army, you're going to get deserves.

1499
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:21.76
Yeah. I'm going to work in an army like that. The same thing with the business.

1500
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:23.76
You start laying out severe punishment.

1501
01:17:23.76 --> 01:17:28.76
Punishment that doesn't make sense isn't reciprocal to the crime that was committed.

1502
01:17:28.76 --> 01:17:31.76
I mean, you pillage thinking about what pillaging is. I took some bread from the store.

1503
01:17:31.76 --> 01:17:34.76
Cool. We're going to shoot these ahead.

1504
01:17:34.76 --> 01:17:40.76
The punishment did not fit the crime in that case.

1505
01:17:40.76 --> 01:17:42.76
All right.

1506
01:17:42.76 --> 01:17:47.76
Eight. He's talking about where to build where to build tactical positions.

1507
01:17:47.76 --> 01:17:52.76
And he says, and this is just the same thing. He said earlier about people, but he's talking about.

1508
01:17:52.76 --> 01:17:58.76
Basically talking about terrain now. Nature is infinitely stronger than the works of man. Why not profit from it?

1509
01:17:58.76 --> 01:18:07.76
Using use a river, use a hill, use terrain to build your defensive positions. Don't just use a shovel.

1510
01:18:07.76 --> 01:18:14.76
Same thing that he talked about earlier with with human beings.

1511
01:18:14.76 --> 01:18:18.76
Now another piece.

1512
01:18:18.76 --> 01:18:23.76
Many persons believe that his advantage is to take the field early.

1513
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:28.76
And this is coming right back. Suns who are to war be their first sex.

1514
01:18:28.76 --> 01:18:34.76
Maybe doesn't agree with that a little bit here. They are right when there's a question of seizing an important post.

1515
01:18:34.76 --> 01:18:42.76
Otherwise, it seems to me that there is no need to hasten in that one should remain in winter quarters longer than usual.

1516
01:18:42.76 --> 01:18:47.76
So he goes on to talk winter quarters means you're going to go out in the field.

1517
01:18:47.76 --> 01:18:48.76
Well, we're going to go out in the field now.

1518
01:18:48.76 --> 01:18:53.76
We're going to be cold wet miserable for the next three days while we wait for the enemy to show up. And now they show up fresh.

1519
01:18:53.76 --> 01:18:55.76
Who's going to do better in the battle?

1520
01:18:55.76 --> 01:19:03.76
So just to think about, I used to say, the military used to say all the time, you know, you got to be forward leaning.

1521
01:19:03.76 --> 01:19:06.76
You heard that expression? Yeah, you got to be forward leaning.

1522
01:19:06.76 --> 01:19:12.76
And I would say, let's not be so forward leaning that we're in the leaning rest of the leaning rest is the push-up position,

1523
01:19:12.76 --> 01:19:15.76
which they would leave you in for a long periods of time.

1524
01:19:15.76 --> 01:19:18.76
A lot of different training situations.

1525
01:19:18.76 --> 01:19:25.76
So sometimes you get so proactive to get so leaning forward, a forward leaning that you're in the leaning rest and you're wasting energy, just trying to be prepared.

1526
01:19:25.76 --> 01:19:31.76
Like, you see some guys warm up. You do such a good warm up that your tires.

1527
01:19:31.76 --> 01:19:34.76
You win so far forward leaning, you're in the leaning rest.

1528
01:19:34.76 --> 01:19:38.76
And then the other thing is to not warm up at all, now you're not ready. So you've got to find the way you get that's a guy.

1529
01:19:38.76 --> 01:19:40.76
God of the leadership, you've got to find the balance between those two.

1530
01:19:40.76 --> 01:19:42.76
Yeah.

1531
01:19:42.76 --> 01:19:48.76
Another good point here, back to the book. It is absolutely necessary to a custom soldiers to labor.

1532
01:19:48.76 --> 01:19:53.76
If we examine Roman history, we find, we shall find that

1533
01:19:53.76 --> 01:20:01.76
Republic looked on ease and indolence as the most formidable enemies.

1534
01:20:01.76 --> 01:20:08.76
The consoles prepared their legions for battle by rendering them indiphatekbon.

1535
01:20:08.76 --> 01:20:15.76
Rather than have them idle, they employed them on unnecessary works.

1536
01:20:15.76 --> 01:20:23.76
Continual exercise makes good soldiers because it qualifies them for military duties by being habituated to pain.

1537
01:20:23.76 --> 01:20:28.76
They insensibly learn to despise danger.

1538
01:20:28.76 --> 01:20:32.76
The transition from fatigue to rest,

1539
01:20:32.76 --> 01:20:38.76
and renovates them, meaning weakens them. They compare one state with another.

1540
01:20:38.76 --> 01:20:44.76
And idleness, that predominant passion of mankind gains a tendency over them.

1541
01:20:44.76 --> 01:20:53.76
They then murmur at every trifling inconvenience, and their souls soften in their amasculated bodies.

1542
01:20:53.76 --> 01:21:03.76
So what he's saying is, people get used to the soft ways, people get used to the easy life.

1543
01:21:03.76 --> 01:21:08.76
And if you let him get used to it, when you want to do something hard, when it's time to do something hard, you're not ready for it.

1544
01:21:08.76 --> 01:21:11.76
Every minute that Charlie's out in the bush getting stronger.

1545
01:21:11.76 --> 01:21:14.76
Every time I'm saying every day at night, I'm spending this hotel to apocalypse now.

1546
01:21:14.76 --> 01:21:19.76
Every night I'm sitting in the hotel getting softer, every night, Charlie's out in the bush getting stronger.

1547
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:21.76
That's what he's talking about here.

1548
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:26.76
But now, do I agree with having people do unnecessary works?

1549
01:21:26.76 --> 01:21:32.76
No, I don't because people see right through that, and it's just you're just being stupid and taking...

1550
01:21:32.76 --> 01:21:35.76
They're going to see that. They're going to say, why are we doing this?

1551
01:21:35.76 --> 01:21:38.76
Take the whole Philip back up, take the whole Philip back up. No, don't do that.

1552
01:21:38.76 --> 01:21:40.76
But you know what we're going to do? Training exercise?

1553
01:21:40.76 --> 01:21:43.76
We're going to get stronger, we're going to get...

1554
01:21:43.76 --> 01:21:46.76
We're going to dig all, we're going to put, you know, set it up for a perimeter,

1555
01:21:46.76 --> 01:21:52.76
then we're going to move to another situation. If we have to back away or collapse our perimeter,

1556
01:21:52.76 --> 01:21:55.76
because when you collapse a perimeter, you've got to fill that whole back in, otherwise in the end,

1557
01:21:55.76 --> 01:21:57.76
it becomes a tack you. They use it.

1558
01:21:57.76 --> 01:22:00.76
So you've got to fill that whole back in. So let's run a real drill.

1559
01:22:00.76 --> 01:22:04.76
And by the way, let's make it into a little contest and see how fast we can dig in.

1560
01:22:04.76 --> 01:22:07.76
And then once we get it dug in, we're going to set up, we're going to see how fast we can collapse it,

1561
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:09.76
get it filled back in. We're doing it at the end of it.

1562
01:22:09.76 --> 01:22:12.76
We're going to give out some, you know, surprises and have a beer.

1563
01:22:12.76 --> 01:22:16.76
It's a good tactic, by the way, like to make a,

1564
01:22:16.76 --> 01:22:21.76
what a big game, or a big game.

1565
01:22:21.76 --> 01:22:25.76
You totally gave it for us. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones. Game of Hikation.

1566
01:22:25.76 --> 01:22:30.76
Game of Hikation. Like if you're moving, you know, when you're moving, yeah, you're house-water.

1567
01:22:30.76 --> 01:22:33.76
And how fast can I get this stuff packed up?

1568
01:22:33.76 --> 01:22:35.76
Yeah, let me use it as a little workout, little metcon,

1569
01:22:35.76 --> 01:22:39.76
we got to move all these boxes upstairs, two floors, whatever.

1570
01:22:39.76 --> 01:22:41.76
I mean, use it as a workout.

1571
01:22:41.76 --> 01:22:44.16
It kind of makes it more enjoyable as well.

1572
01:22:44.16 --> 01:22:47.76
But at the same time, you get the results of a little workout right there.

1573
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:51.76
Here, let me ask you this about that when you said you didn't agree with the unnecessary

1574
01:22:51.76 --> 01:22:52.76
unnecessary works.

1575
01:22:52.76 --> 01:22:55.76
So what about push-ups as punishment?

1576
01:22:55.76 --> 01:22:57.76
For example, or a cat or exercise?

1577
01:22:57.76 --> 01:23:01.76
That's an interesting one because I think, I think, like with kids, if you make

1578
01:23:01.76 --> 01:23:04.76
burpees uponishment, they don't like it.

1579
01:23:04.76 --> 01:23:06.76
Like, if you make it a reward, they like them.

1580
01:23:06.76 --> 01:23:07.76
And you better off.

1581
01:23:07.76 --> 01:23:09.76
Yeah, agree. I do that by the way.

1582
01:23:09.76 --> 01:23:11.76
Yeah, that's good. You make it a reward.

1583
01:23:11.76 --> 01:23:12.76
Yeah, like, wow.

1584
01:23:12.76 --> 01:23:13.76
Only the cool people do burpees.

1585
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:17.76
That's what they see dead-dim burpees, dead-dim, you know, these whatever exercise.

1586
01:23:17.76 --> 01:23:19.76
Yeah, only cool people do it.

1587
01:23:19.76 --> 01:23:22.76
I kind of push-harm on that too, but it's unfair.

1588
01:23:22.76 --> 01:23:26.76
But no, the question is, though, in the military, in the military.

1589
01:23:26.76 --> 01:23:28.76
Not kids.

1590
01:23:28.76 --> 01:23:30.76
No, calisthenics are definitely punishment in the military.

1591
01:23:30.76 --> 01:23:31.76
Yeah, straight up.

1592
01:23:31.76 --> 01:23:34.76
And it's not until you transition out of the boot camp series

1593
01:23:34.76 --> 01:23:38.76
and you get away from that. Now, in the seal teams, like, they don't,

1594
01:23:38.76 --> 01:23:42.76
you don't do calisthenics as punishment.

1595
01:23:42.76 --> 01:23:47.76
I will say that if you mess up, like, for instance,

1596
01:23:47.76 --> 01:23:53.76
when I was running training, if the guys performed poorly,

1597
01:23:53.76 --> 01:23:55.76
they were going to have more down to men.

1598
01:23:55.76 --> 01:23:57.76
Again, this is a training.

1599
01:23:57.76 --> 01:23:59.76
I'm talking about fake down men, but they're going to have more men that

1600
01:23:59.76 --> 01:24:01.76
couldn't walk.

1601
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:03.76
That's more men that have to be carried.

1602
01:24:03.76 --> 01:24:04.76
That's punishment.

1603
01:24:04.76 --> 01:24:05.76
If it's own right.

1604
01:24:05.76 --> 01:24:06.76
That's punishment.

1605
01:24:06.76 --> 01:24:10.76
If you, when I was running a communications course,

1606
01:24:10.76 --> 01:24:13.76
when I was a younger, enlisted seal,

1607
01:24:13.76 --> 01:24:15.76
if you missed a communications window,

1608
01:24:15.76 --> 01:24:18.76
you had to walk a longer distance.

1609
01:24:18.76 --> 01:24:23.76
If you missed multiple, you're going to have to walk tragic distances.

1610
01:24:23.76 --> 01:24:26.76
But that wasn't just a natural result of you missing missing.

1611
01:24:26.76 --> 01:24:28.76
Did you impose that for your imposed?

1612
01:24:28.76 --> 01:24:31.76
Yes, you were imposed and they knew it was imposed.

1613
01:24:31.76 --> 01:24:32.76
Yeah, okay.

1614
01:24:32.76 --> 01:24:37.76
And so yeah, if you miss in the seal teams,

1615
01:24:37.76 --> 01:24:42.76
if you miss the extraction point with a boat coming to pick you up after a dive,

1616
01:24:42.76 --> 01:24:44.76
well, now you've got to swim to the new, exactly.

1617
01:24:44.76 --> 01:24:45.76
New pick up point.

1618
01:24:45.76 --> 01:24:46.76
Guess what?

1619
01:24:46.76 --> 01:24:47.76
The new pick up point isn't close.

1620
01:24:47.76 --> 01:24:48.76
Yeah.

1621
01:24:48.76 --> 01:24:49.76
Because you've compromised now.

1622
01:24:49.76 --> 01:24:50.76
You're above the surface.

1623
01:24:50.76 --> 01:24:51.76
You need to get away.

1624
01:24:51.76 --> 01:24:52.76
Yeah.

1625
01:24:52.76 --> 01:24:53.76
And so that means you've got to swim in extra,

1626
01:24:53.76 --> 01:24:57.76
you know, maybe it's an extra hour of surface swimming with a rig on.

1627
01:24:57.76 --> 01:24:59.76
It's not fun, but I know.

1628
01:24:59.76 --> 01:25:00.76
I've done some fun.

1629
01:25:00.76 --> 01:25:03.76
Yeah, because you can't, you're not just, you're not just having fun.

1630
01:25:03.76 --> 01:25:04.76
Right?

1631
01:25:04.76 --> 01:25:05.76
It's called trouble backing.

1632
01:25:05.76 --> 01:25:08.76
You're laying on your back because it's really awkward.

1633
01:25:08.76 --> 01:25:12.76
It's, it's, it's comfortable to dive with our dive rig.

1634
01:25:12.76 --> 01:25:13.76
We have a dive rig.

1635
01:25:13.76 --> 01:25:15.76
That's, it's called a rebreether.

1636
01:25:15.76 --> 01:25:16.76
Yeah.

1637
01:25:16.76 --> 01:25:17.76
And it goes on your chest and it's small.

1638
01:25:17.76 --> 01:25:19.76
It's not, it's not tiny.

1639
01:25:19.76 --> 01:25:21.76
Close, it's close, circuit.

1640
01:25:21.76 --> 01:25:22.76
Yeah, look at you.

1641
01:25:22.76 --> 01:25:23.76
Look at you.

1642
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:24.76
Big time.

1643
01:25:24.76 --> 01:25:25.76
So it's a close, circuit dive rig.

1644
01:25:25.76 --> 01:25:27.76
But when it runs out, you can't,

1645
01:25:27.76 --> 01:25:28.76
it doesn't work anymore.

1646
01:25:28.76 --> 01:25:31.76
So you have to swim.

1647
01:25:31.76 --> 01:25:33.76
And we do something called turtle back generally.

1648
01:25:33.76 --> 01:25:35.76
We just basically are laying on your back and you're just

1649
01:25:35.76 --> 01:25:38.76
offending and it takes a long time to move very far.

1650
01:25:38.76 --> 01:25:40.76
And it's not comfortable.

1651
01:25:40.76 --> 01:25:42.76
So the punishment is in training.

1652
01:25:42.76 --> 01:25:44.76
If you miss your extraction point, that's fine.

1653
01:25:44.76 --> 01:25:47.76
Just got to swim to the alternate extraction point.

1654
01:25:47.76 --> 01:25:50.76
Your alternate extraction point is not going to be closed by.

1655
01:25:50.76 --> 01:25:51.76
Yeah.

1656
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:52.76
Because you screwed up.

1657
01:25:52.76 --> 01:25:52.76
Yeah.

1658
01:25:52.76 --> 01:25:55.76
Same thing with if you miss your helicopter extraction,

1659
01:25:55.76 --> 01:25:58.76
because you took too long on target and you got bogged down.

1660
01:25:58.76 --> 01:26:00.76
It took you long time to move all these down people.

1661
01:26:00.76 --> 01:26:01.76
That's, I mean, it happens.

1662
01:26:01.76 --> 01:26:03.76
We understand that.

1663
01:26:03.76 --> 01:26:07.76
But now you have to walk to the secondary extraction point,

1664
01:26:07.76 --> 01:26:10.76
which happens to be six kilometers up a hill.

1665
01:26:10.76 --> 01:26:11.76
Yeah.

1666
01:26:11.76 --> 01:26:14.76
See, but that's to me and this me thinking whatever.

1667
01:26:14.76 --> 01:26:16.76
10 seconds about it.

1668
01:26:16.76 --> 01:26:19.76
That seems like that makes perfect sense.

1669
01:26:19.76 --> 01:26:21.76
In fact, that seems like a cool little strategy because

1670
01:26:21.76 --> 01:26:22.76
in real life, that's how it works.

1671
01:26:22.76 --> 01:26:23.76
Yes.

1672
01:26:23.76 --> 01:26:25.76
You miss the bus.

1673
01:26:25.76 --> 01:26:26.76
You ride the bus to school.

1674
01:26:26.76 --> 01:26:27.76
You miss the bus.

1675
01:26:27.76 --> 01:26:29.76
You're walking to school or writing it by whatever.

1676
01:26:29.76 --> 01:26:31.76
It's kind of that thing.

1677
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:33.76
That's how life deals it to you.

1678
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:34.76
A lot of the time.

1679
01:26:34.76 --> 01:26:35.76
Like these types of things.

1680
01:26:35.76 --> 01:26:36.76
What you're saying.

1681
01:26:36.76 --> 01:26:36.76
Yeah.

1682
01:26:36.76 --> 01:26:40.76
But let's say, hey, you know, your shoes aren't shine or whatever.

1683
01:26:40.76 --> 01:26:41.76
I don't know.

1684
01:26:41.76 --> 01:26:42.76
We don't shine.

1685
01:26:42.76 --> 01:26:43.76
Give me 50 push-ups.

1686
01:26:43.76 --> 01:26:44.76
Yeah, no, they don't do that.

1687
01:26:44.76 --> 01:26:45.76
They don't do it in the seal teams.

1688
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:47.76
They definitely do it in the army.

1689
01:26:47.76 --> 01:26:49.76
They definitely do it in the Rangers.

1690
01:26:49.76 --> 01:26:51.76
They're dropping down all the time.

1691
01:26:51.76 --> 01:26:52.76
Right.

1692
01:26:52.76 --> 01:26:53.76
But no, we don't do that.

1693
01:26:53.76 --> 01:26:54.76
So that's the question.

1694
01:26:54.76 --> 01:26:58.76
Do you agree with that or do you think about that kind of stuff?

1695
01:26:58.76 --> 01:26:59.76
I don't think about that kind of stuff.

1696
01:26:59.76 --> 01:27:05.76
Yeah, I think being, I would say that I, that I would not do it.

1697
01:27:05.76 --> 01:27:06.76
Yeah.

1698
01:27:06.76 --> 01:27:11.76
When I was in a military leadership position, just because I would rather,

1699
01:27:11.76 --> 01:27:12.76
I don't know.

1700
01:27:12.76 --> 01:27:13.76
Yeah, it's weird.

1701
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:15.76
It feels like it, like, just like, you're...

1702
01:27:15.76 --> 01:27:18.76
Okay, make sense when I know that the army runs it that way.

1703
01:27:18.76 --> 01:27:19.76
It makes sense.

1704
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:20.76
And by the way, when the army does it,

1705
01:27:20.76 --> 01:27:23.76
and I shouldn't even say anything else about the way the army does it.

1706
01:27:23.76 --> 01:27:27.76
Because I'm not, I don't know exactly how they implement that strategy.

1707
01:27:27.76 --> 01:27:31.76
So next time we have Tim Kennedy on, we'll get him to give us a full debrief on that.

1708
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:35.76
We'll get another, another range run here to give us a full debrief on that.

1709
01:27:35.76 --> 01:27:36.76
Here's something.

1710
01:27:36.76 --> 01:27:41.76
So I was watching this show, this random show me my wife before we were married.

1711
01:27:41.76 --> 01:27:45.76
When we were just dating whatever, we'd watch these random shows.

1712
01:27:45.76 --> 01:27:48.76
And it was a kind of like a reality show, kind of like a competition show,

1713
01:27:48.76 --> 01:27:52.76
but it was, I think, army, like, you know, you grab regular people,

1714
01:27:52.76 --> 01:27:55.76
put them in army scenario, you give them like missions, and it's like...

1715
01:27:55.76 --> 01:27:59.76
Because they have a major, they have a best range, or every year they have a best range of competition,

1716
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:01.76
which is a really hardcore competition.

1717
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:02.76
Yeah.

1718
01:28:02.76 --> 01:28:06.76
Well, it's, you know what, it's a lot like the FTX, a lot like that,

1719
01:28:06.76 --> 01:28:09.76
but it's a whole, like, you know, you're there for like a month or whatever.

1720
01:28:09.76 --> 01:28:13.76
And same, but a lot of drill sergeant type situations,

1721
01:28:13.76 --> 01:28:15.76
dropping in me 20, 50, whatever, right?

1722
01:28:15.76 --> 01:28:17.76
So it was towards the end of the season and whatever.

1723
01:28:17.76 --> 01:28:23.76
And this girl was like, she was like, dang, look how strong and muscular my arms are now.

1724
01:28:23.76 --> 01:28:26.76
Just from all the push-ups we had to do in stuff like that.

1725
01:28:26.76 --> 01:28:30.76
Just by happenstents, sure she was getting punished, sure she was learning to,

1726
01:28:30.76 --> 01:28:34.76
you know, follow directions more meticulously and all the stuff that you learn from, you know,

1727
01:28:34.76 --> 01:28:37.76
the whole, you know, orders versus punishment situation.

1728
01:28:37.76 --> 01:28:42.76
But as kind of a byproduct, if you will, she has some physical strength now.

1729
01:28:42.76 --> 01:28:44.76
You know, you wonder if that has something to do with it?

1730
01:28:44.76 --> 01:28:47.76
Oh, no, definitely, you're definitely making people stronger.

1731
01:28:47.76 --> 01:28:48.76
There's no doubt about it.

1732
01:28:48.76 --> 01:28:50.76
Yeah, that's all positive for sure.

1733
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:55.76
Yeah, there's no doubt the great byproduct of of calistening,

1734
01:28:55.76 --> 01:28:58.76
because punishment is, you get stronger.

1735
01:28:58.76 --> 01:28:59.76
Yeah.

1736
01:28:59.76 --> 01:29:03.76
But like in the, in the seals, it's weird, it's weird.

1737
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:04.76
It's not a thing.

1738
01:29:04.76 --> 01:29:05.76
Yeah.

1739
01:29:05.76 --> 01:29:06.76
It's not a thing.

1740
01:29:06.76 --> 01:29:09.76
Like, okay, you're going to drop down and give me 50, like that literally,

1741
01:29:09.76 --> 01:29:12.76
I never saw that happen a single,

1742
01:29:12.76 --> 01:29:16.76
it might happen with new guys sometimes, like,

1743
01:29:16.76 --> 01:29:18.76
you're a new guy that you're not getting through.

1744
01:29:18.76 --> 01:29:19.76
Okay, guess what?

1745
01:29:19.76 --> 01:29:22.76
But even with new guys, if you really want to get through to new guy,

1746
01:29:22.76 --> 01:29:24.76
what you want them to be good at is tactics, not pushups.

1747
01:29:24.76 --> 01:29:27.76
People in teams, you're supposed to do pushups on your own man.

1748
01:29:27.76 --> 01:29:28.76
Yeah, that's kind of what it seems like.

1749
01:29:28.76 --> 01:29:30.76
We're not in here to teach you how to do pushups.

1750
01:29:30.76 --> 01:29:33.76
Like, you need to, you need to be in shape.

1751
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:36.76
But we seem to like get better things to do.

1752
01:29:36.76 --> 01:29:37.76
Yes.

1753
01:29:37.76 --> 01:29:38.76
Yes.

1754
01:29:38.76 --> 01:29:40.76
But at the same time, you can't help but wonder,

1755
01:29:40.76 --> 01:29:43.76
maybe that's just like, that's a certain way of looking at it,

1756
01:29:43.76 --> 01:29:44.76
which is good.

1757
01:29:44.76 --> 01:29:46.76
It seems obvious seems effective to me,

1758
01:29:46.76 --> 01:29:48.76
but what if there's something like that,

1759
01:29:48.76 --> 01:29:50.76
you know, like something from back in the day,

1760
01:29:50.76 --> 01:29:55.76
some old school, fundamental principle that that's kind of why you do it.

1761
01:29:55.76 --> 01:29:58.76
That's super maybe, maybe that's why in the teams,

1762
01:29:58.76 --> 01:30:01.76
they don't do it because they want you to be self-disciplined.

1763
01:30:01.76 --> 01:30:03.76
Yeah, not like specificity.

1764
01:30:03.76 --> 01:30:06.76
Yeah, not self, not disciplined by the group, but post.

1765
01:30:06.76 --> 01:30:09.76
But yeah, you don't want to impose discipline.

1766
01:30:09.76 --> 01:30:12.76
And just so, well, regardless,

1767
01:30:12.76 --> 01:30:14.76
I think that you should train hard

1768
01:30:14.76 --> 01:30:19.76
because you don't want to have your soul get soft

1769
01:30:19.76 --> 01:30:22.76
and inside of your amazculated body.

1770
01:30:22.76 --> 01:30:25.76
That just sounds like something I don't want to be a part of.

1771
01:30:25.76 --> 01:30:27.76
It's all keep training.

1772
01:30:27.76 --> 01:30:32.76
Back to the book, there is more skill in one might think,

1773
01:30:32.76 --> 01:30:36.76
then one might think in making poor dispositions,

1774
01:30:36.76 --> 01:30:40.76
potentially, but one must be able to change them into good ones.

1775
01:30:40.76 --> 01:30:44.76
And an instant, so he's talking about how you set yourself up in a bad position.

1776
01:30:44.76 --> 01:30:48.76
Only to let the enemy try and maneuver on that,

1777
01:30:48.76 --> 01:30:50.76
but you're waiting for him, he's already in do something,

1778
01:30:50.76 --> 01:30:52.76
you change your position and do something good.

1779
01:30:52.76 --> 01:30:55.76
Like in Gigiitsu when you let someone set up a triangle,

1780
01:30:55.76 --> 01:30:57.76
but you're just trying to pass their guard.

1781
01:30:57.76 --> 01:31:01.76
Yeah, nothing is more disconcerting to the enemy.

1782
01:31:01.76 --> 01:31:03.76
He has counted on a certain thing,

1783
01:31:03.76 --> 01:31:06.76
has disposed himself accordingly,

1784
01:31:06.76 --> 01:31:11.76
and at the instant of attacking, it is changed.

1785
01:31:11.76 --> 01:31:15.76
So this is pretty cool, right?

1786
01:31:15.76 --> 01:31:18.76
This is a good thing to remember.

1787
01:31:18.76 --> 01:31:21.76
I like what he talked about is psychological effect

1788
01:31:21.76 --> 01:31:22.76
that it has on the enemy.

1789
01:31:22.76 --> 01:31:24.76
So the enemy sees something,

1790
01:31:24.76 --> 01:31:26.76
they expect something,

1791
01:31:26.76 --> 01:31:28.76
they want something to go a certain way,

1792
01:31:28.76 --> 01:31:30.76
so they arrange themselves for it,

1793
01:31:30.76 --> 01:31:32.76
and then right, when they're getting ready to execute,

1794
01:31:32.76 --> 01:31:34.76
they realize it wasn't what they thought,

1795
01:31:34.76 --> 01:31:36.76
and he says there's nothing more disconcerting,

1796
01:31:36.76 --> 01:31:38.76
and I'd say that's true with a person too.

1797
01:31:38.76 --> 01:31:41.76
You know, with the unexpected is what disturbs people,

1798
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:44.76
especially, you see this all-time in MMA,

1799
01:31:44.76 --> 01:31:46.76
where a guy gets close to his submission,

1800
01:31:46.76 --> 01:31:48.76
and then the guy gets out,

1801
01:31:48.76 --> 01:31:49.76
and he expends it to the general,

1802
01:31:49.76 --> 01:31:54.76
you can see the moral draining from their face,

1803
01:31:54.76 --> 01:31:56.76
when it's bad, he's bad sometimes.

1804
01:31:56.76 --> 01:31:59.76
Dude, something.

1805
01:31:59.76 --> 01:32:03.76
He goes on, I repeat,

1806
01:32:03.76 --> 01:32:06.76
nothing confuses him so greatly,

1807
01:32:06.76 --> 01:32:10.76
and leads him into more serious faults.

1808
01:32:10.76 --> 01:32:13.76
If he does not change his disposition,

1809
01:32:13.76 --> 01:32:14.76
he will be defeated.

1810
01:32:14.76 --> 01:32:17.76
And if he changes them in the presence of the enemy,

1811
01:32:17.76 --> 01:32:19.76
he will still be defeated.

1812
01:32:19.76 --> 01:32:23.76
Human spirit cannot meet it.

1813
01:32:23.76 --> 01:32:28.76
I'm trying to think of how that affects someone's sight.

1814
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:31.76
Oh, yeah, it affects, it definitely affects your psychological,

1815
01:32:31.76 --> 01:32:33.76
like you throw the, you think you're going to get this person

1816
01:32:33.76 --> 01:32:35.76
to try and go, you put it on there,

1817
01:32:35.76 --> 01:32:36.76
and then almost on boom, you realize,

1818
01:32:36.76 --> 01:32:38.76
it's not just that you missed the triangle,

1819
01:32:38.76 --> 01:32:39.76
it's a realized that you got played.

1820
01:32:39.76 --> 01:32:41.76
You got played, you got set right up.

1821
01:32:41.76 --> 01:32:42.76
And that doesn't feel good,

1822
01:32:42.76 --> 01:32:44.76
and that can definitely hurt your morale.

1823
01:32:44.76 --> 01:32:46.76
Yeah, yeah, big.

1824
01:32:46.76 --> 01:32:50.76
That's a little different than just missing the move.

1825
01:32:50.76 --> 01:32:52.76
When you realize you got set, actually,

1826
01:32:52.76 --> 01:32:54.76
that it messes up your whole game, so,

1827
01:32:54.76 --> 01:32:56.76
okay, so you're always still, right?

1828
01:32:56.76 --> 01:32:57.76
Yeah.

1829
01:32:57.76 --> 01:33:00.76
So that's, I don't want to say that's his whole game,

1830
01:33:00.76 --> 01:33:01.76
but that's his game right there.

1831
01:33:01.76 --> 01:33:04.76
So, like if you go, you know,

1832
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:06.76
side control or amount or whatever,

1833
01:33:06.76 --> 01:33:07.76
he has dangerous moves.

1834
01:33:07.76 --> 01:33:08.76
He wants you there.

1835
01:33:08.76 --> 01:33:09.76
One, yes, exactly.

1836
01:33:09.76 --> 01:33:12.76
So it's like, and every once in a while,

1837
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:13.76
you get rolling with him like kind of hard.

1838
01:33:13.76 --> 01:33:15.76
It'll seem like he's trying to defend the mount,

1839
01:33:15.76 --> 01:33:18.76
but he's really letting you think that you got the mount.

1840
01:33:18.76 --> 01:33:19.76
Right? You know, because even if you're like,

1841
01:33:19.76 --> 01:33:21.76
if someone's letting you mount, you know,

1842
01:33:21.76 --> 01:33:22.76
they're letting you mount.

1843
01:33:22.76 --> 01:33:24.76
And if they're going to spring some sort of a trap,

1844
01:33:24.76 --> 01:33:26.76
it's going to be more obvious if they're letting you do it.

1845
01:33:26.76 --> 01:33:29.76
But you get them where he kind of lets you do it to the point

1846
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:31.76
where you don't realize he's letting me in.

1847
01:33:31.76 --> 01:33:32.76
Yeah, you just got and then he came in.

1848
01:33:32.76 --> 01:33:34.76
And then after while he keeps doing stuff like that,

1849
01:33:34.76 --> 01:33:35.76
you're like,

1850
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:37.76
I don't even really want to do anything to him.

1851
01:33:37.76 --> 01:33:38.76
Because he's just going to set me,

1852
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:40.76
this is just a bunch of traps right now.

1853
01:33:40.76 --> 01:33:41.76
So it messes up your whole game.

1854
01:33:41.76 --> 01:33:42.76
You can't do anything.

1855
01:33:42.76 --> 01:33:43.76
Yeah.

1856
01:33:43.76 --> 01:33:44.76
On your own accord though,

1857
01:33:44.76 --> 01:33:46.76
it's not like he's preventing you from doing anything.

1858
01:33:46.76 --> 01:33:47.76
Yeah.

1859
01:33:47.76 --> 01:33:49.76
It's like you're preventing yourself now.

1860
01:33:49.76 --> 01:33:51.76
That's a situation you have to deal with.

1861
01:33:51.76 --> 01:33:55.76
But actually, actually, I figured it out.

1862
01:33:55.76 --> 01:33:57.76
I figured out an,

1863
01:33:57.76 --> 01:33:59.76
I didn't figure it out.

1864
01:33:59.76 --> 01:34:02.76
I figured out a method to deal with just that whole scenario

1865
01:34:02.76 --> 01:34:03.76
within, by the way.

1866
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:05.76
And he even like asked me afterwards.

1867
01:34:05.76 --> 01:34:07.76
So I was like, Oh, I was going hard.

1868
01:34:07.76 --> 01:34:10.76
And I was like, you know how you get real like weary.

1869
01:34:10.76 --> 01:34:12.76
Like, okay, I know he's gonna send me a source real uneven for real.

1870
01:34:12.76 --> 01:34:14.76
So I was like, hey, let's go roll again.

1871
01:34:14.76 --> 01:34:18.76
And then I just loosened up and basically allowed him to spring

1872
01:34:18.76 --> 01:34:19.76
whatever trap he wants.

1873
01:34:19.76 --> 01:34:21.76
And he did all this stuff and he was like,

1874
01:34:21.76 --> 01:34:23.76
hey, you were rolling a lot later in that time.

1875
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:25.76
I was like, no, bro, I'm just trying to,

1876
01:34:25.76 --> 01:34:28.76
I'm trying to turn on the lights to all your traps that he said.

1877
01:34:28.76 --> 01:34:30.76
You know, so it's kind of like that thing.

1878
01:34:30.76 --> 01:34:33.76
It's comes with like the type of training like you can't

1879
01:34:33.76 --> 01:34:35.76
regard the training as a competition.

1880
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:37.76
Yeah, you know, you gotta go and it should be like otherwise

1881
01:34:37.76 --> 01:34:39.76
you're not learning anything.

1882
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:40.76
Yeah.

1883
01:34:40.76 --> 01:34:43.76
But man, you know, in a war battle or in a competition scenario,

1884
01:34:43.76 --> 01:34:45.76
it's like, you know, can you a big day?

1885
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:49.76
I'm trying to think if I ever got played like that on the battlefield.

1886
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:52.76
You know, sometimes we'd hit a target.

1887
01:34:52.76 --> 01:34:57.76
And it was real obvious that, you know, we had been.

1888
01:34:57.76 --> 01:35:00.76
I wouldn't say set up, but like there's no one there.

1889
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:03.76
Like clearly the information that we got was wrong.

1890
01:35:03.76 --> 01:35:05.76
And you'd be kind of like, you know,

1891
01:35:05.76 --> 01:35:07.76
be like, man, that wasn't good.

1892
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:10.76
Yeah, and really at a real rudimentary level,

1893
01:35:10.76 --> 01:35:12.76
that's what an idea is, you know,

1894
01:35:12.76 --> 01:35:15.76
it's like, you want to make it look like a trash cannon or a regular

1895
01:35:15.76 --> 01:35:17.76
something you have to address or something like that.

1896
01:35:17.76 --> 01:35:19.76
You know, some a place where you have to go anyway,

1897
01:35:19.76 --> 01:35:20.76
the road.

1898
01:35:20.76 --> 01:35:23.76
I don't know what a real simple level that's kind of what that is.

1899
01:35:23.76 --> 01:35:26.76
So now you're like, shoot, now we got to be weary of everyday things.

1900
01:35:26.76 --> 01:35:27.76
Normal protocol.

1901
01:35:27.76 --> 01:35:29.76
We got to be weary of that.

1902
01:35:29.76 --> 01:35:33.76
Yeah, that's a digger on the psychology for sure.

1903
01:35:33.76 --> 01:35:34.76
Back to the book.

1904
01:35:34.76 --> 01:35:37.76
I do not care for either one.

1905
01:35:37.76 --> 01:35:38.76
Oh, sorry.

1906
01:35:38.76 --> 01:35:40.76
It says lines in entrenchment.

1907
01:35:40.76 --> 01:35:42.76
So he's talking about lines in entrenchment,

1908
01:35:42.76 --> 01:35:43.76
meaning defensive positions.

1909
01:35:43.76 --> 01:35:48.76
I do not care for either the one or the other of these works.

1910
01:35:48.76 --> 01:35:50.76
When I hear talk of lines,

1911
01:35:50.76 --> 01:35:55.76
I always think I am hearing of talk of the walls of China.

1912
01:35:55.76 --> 01:35:58.76
The good ones are those that nature has made,

1913
01:35:58.76 --> 01:36:02.76
and the good entrenchments are good dispositions

1914
01:36:02.76 --> 01:36:05.76
and brave soldiers.

1915
01:36:05.76 --> 01:36:10.76
Again, just capitalizing on nature and saying that brave soldiers

1916
01:36:10.76 --> 01:36:13.76
are more important than your position.

1917
01:36:13.76 --> 01:36:17.76
Man always fears the consequences of day and night.

1918
01:36:17.76 --> 01:36:21.76
The consequences of danger more than danger itself.

1919
01:36:21.76 --> 01:36:24.76
Totally true.

1920
01:36:24.76 --> 01:36:27.76
When, and I'll tell you what's equally,

1921
01:36:27.76 --> 01:36:31.76
or you could throw in there is the, the anticipation of danger.

1922
01:36:31.76 --> 01:36:33.76
It's probably the worst thing.

1923
01:36:33.76 --> 01:36:34.76
Yeah.

1924
01:36:34.76 --> 01:36:36.76
You know, I see this, I see a lot of kids on the wrestling mat right now.

1925
01:36:36.76 --> 01:36:37.76
It's the wrestling season.

1926
01:36:37.76 --> 01:36:38.76
Yeah.

1927
01:36:38.76 --> 01:36:41.76
And you can see the kids get nervous before they get on the map.

1928
01:36:41.76 --> 01:36:42.76
They want to get on the map.

1929
01:36:42.76 --> 01:36:43.76
They want to get on the map.

1930
01:36:43.76 --> 01:36:44.76
They're in the game.

1931
01:36:44.76 --> 01:36:44.76
Yeah.

1932
01:36:44.76 --> 01:36:45.76
And now you're now you're doing your job.

1933
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:48.76
But the anticipation of what could happen.

1934
01:36:48.76 --> 01:36:49.76
Yeah.

1935
01:36:49.76 --> 01:36:50.76
Trust people crazy.

1936
01:36:50.76 --> 01:36:51.76
When is that?

1937
01:36:51.76 --> 01:36:53.76
Because you got it, you felt that before.

1938
01:36:53.76 --> 01:36:55.76
We're, you know, back to day when we were competing.

1939
01:36:55.76 --> 01:36:56.76
Yeah.

1940
01:36:56.76 --> 01:36:59.76
Like, and you get to turn them into a worse, especially back.

1941
01:36:59.76 --> 01:37:02.76
Actually, you're one of your last competitions

1942
01:37:02.76 --> 01:37:04.76
was my first competition.

1943
01:37:04.76 --> 01:37:05.76
Right away.

1944
01:37:05.76 --> 01:37:06.76
Yeah.

1945
01:37:06.76 --> 01:37:07.76
Where was that?

1946
01:37:07.76 --> 01:37:10.76
In LA, it was called like the Pan Amps, a submission grappling.

1947
01:37:10.76 --> 01:37:12.76
It wasn't the Pan Amps, Pan Amps.

1948
01:37:12.76 --> 01:37:15.76
It was like, I think like submission grappling.

1949
01:37:15.76 --> 01:37:16.76
It was no good.

1950
01:37:16.76 --> 01:37:17.76
How did I do?

1951
01:37:17.76 --> 01:37:18.76
I don't know.

1952
01:37:18.76 --> 01:37:19.76
I don't remember.

1953
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:20.76
Yeah.

1954
01:37:20.76 --> 01:37:22.76
I remember seeing all the pictures because one of the,

1955
01:37:22.76 --> 01:37:23.76
It's funny.

1956
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:24.76
One of like, it's not like tournament.

1957
01:37:24.76 --> 01:37:25.76
It was tournament.

1958
01:37:25.76 --> 01:37:26.76
Yeah.

1959
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:28.76
So remember Alicia photos.

1960
01:37:28.76 --> 01:37:29.76
I remember that.

1961
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:29.76
Who ran it?

1962
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:30.76
Who had the tournament?

1963
01:37:30.76 --> 01:37:31.76
I have no idea.

1964
01:37:31.76 --> 01:37:32.76
I didn't even know there was tournaments.

1965
01:37:32.76 --> 01:37:33.76
And I saw one.

1966
01:37:33.76 --> 01:37:34.76
Or, or, or,

1967
01:37:34.76 --> 01:37:36.76
Brand at the time was like, yeah, the tournament.

1968
01:37:36.76 --> 01:37:37.76
I was like, oh, we can have tournaments.

1969
01:37:37.76 --> 01:37:38.76
I was like, boom.

1970
01:37:38.76 --> 01:37:39.76
So I just jumped on it.

1971
01:37:39.76 --> 01:37:40.76
What was the iconic photo?

1972
01:37:40.76 --> 01:37:41.76
I say it's iconic.

1973
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:43.76
Because it's a kind of a long-term.

1974
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:44.76
It's a long word.

1975
01:37:44.76 --> 01:37:45.76
It's a very strong.

1976
01:37:45.76 --> 01:37:47.76
It's not iconic at all actually.

1977
01:37:47.76 --> 01:37:49.76
But it's, yeah, I'm so I'm, we,

1978
01:37:49.76 --> 01:37:50.76
I have this guy.

1979
01:37:50.76 --> 01:37:52.76
His name is Jim.

1980
01:37:52.76 --> 01:37:54.76
You probably know him.

1981
01:37:54.76 --> 01:37:54.76
Jim.

1982
01:37:54.76 --> 01:37:57.76
He, I have him in a, it's not an American.

1983
01:37:57.76 --> 01:37:58.76
It's a straight arm lock.

1984
01:37:58.76 --> 01:37:59.76
Mm-hmm.

1985
01:37:59.76 --> 01:38:01.76
And I wound up tapping him out.

1986
01:38:01.76 --> 01:38:02.76
And Alicia photos.

1987
01:38:02.76 --> 01:38:04.76
So that was the photographer at the time.

1988
01:38:04.76 --> 01:38:06.76
I mean, I had a really good picture of it.

1989
01:38:06.76 --> 01:38:08.76
It was such a good picture.

1990
01:38:08.76 --> 01:38:10.76
It was in the front of her website.

1991
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:11.76
The picture, right?

1992
01:38:11.76 --> 01:38:12.76
That's why I call it iconic photo.

1993
01:38:12.76 --> 01:38:14.76
You know, full on.

1994
01:38:14.76 --> 01:38:15.76
Not this.

1995
01:38:15.76 --> 01:38:17.76
Everyone knows that photo.

1996
01:38:17.76 --> 01:38:18.76
Everyone.

1997
01:38:18.76 --> 01:38:20.76
They probably do if they're just competing back at the day.

1998
01:38:20.76 --> 01:38:22.76
If they know Alicia photos.

1999
01:38:22.76 --> 01:38:24.76
Anyway, the full on like novice division.

2000
01:38:24.76 --> 01:38:25.76
Right.

2001
01:38:25.76 --> 01:38:27.76
I was like, I had been trained for two months twice a week,

2002
01:38:27.76 --> 01:38:28.76
by the way.

2003
01:38:28.76 --> 01:38:30.76
For two months from full month.

2004
01:38:30.76 --> 01:38:32.76
Um, still just dominating out there.

2005
01:38:32.76 --> 01:38:33.76
Look at you.

2006
01:38:33.76 --> 01:38:34.76
Yeah.

2007
01:38:34.76 --> 01:38:35.76
But no, I, I actually lost.

2008
01:38:35.76 --> 01:38:36.76
I lost my first match.

2009
01:38:36.76 --> 01:38:37.76
Took third.

2010
01:38:37.76 --> 01:38:38.76
None of us.

2011
01:38:38.76 --> 01:38:39.76
Doesn't matter.

2012
01:38:39.76 --> 01:38:43.76
Um, so I know that you did it because when I was looking through the pictures,

2013
01:38:43.76 --> 01:38:44.76
it was you compete.

2014
01:38:44.76 --> 01:38:46.76
I think you're competing against like so good.

2015
01:38:46.76 --> 01:38:47.76
You are somebody.

2016
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:48.76
I think for.

2017
01:38:48.76 --> 01:38:49.76
But I remember you.

2018
01:38:49.76 --> 01:38:50.76
People can soak it.

2019
01:38:50.76 --> 01:38:51.76
Yeah.

2020
01:38:51.76 --> 01:38:53.76
Well, it was maybe, I don't know some other black guy.

2021
01:38:53.76 --> 01:38:54.76
But I don't know.

2022
01:38:54.76 --> 01:38:56.76
I remember it was you because I remember like,

2023
01:38:56.76 --> 01:38:57.76
Yeah.

2024
01:38:57.76 --> 01:38:58.76
You.

2025
01:38:58.76 --> 01:38:59.76
I'll have to check that out.

2026
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:00.76
No, no, no.

2027
01:39:00.76 --> 01:39:01.76
I have to explore that.

2028
01:39:01.76 --> 01:39:02.76
But, uh, what was the point?

2029
01:39:02.76 --> 01:39:03.76
Oh, yeah.

2030
01:39:03.76 --> 01:39:05.76
Waiting for the match is like,

2031
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:06.76
that's the nerve.

2032
01:39:06.76 --> 01:39:07.76
Yeah.

2033
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:09.76
Like rolling, even when you step on the match,

2034
01:39:09.76 --> 01:39:11.76
and you see the guy in front of you getting right right,

2035
01:39:11.76 --> 01:39:12.76
that's not nerve-racking at all.

2036
01:39:12.76 --> 01:39:13.76
That's like every day you see that.

2037
01:39:13.76 --> 01:39:16.76
There was a iconic picture of Sarge.

2038
01:39:16.76 --> 01:39:17.76
This is pretty iconic.

2039
01:39:17.76 --> 01:39:19.76
And he, it was going against.

2040
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:23.76
One of the Gracies kids.

2041
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:25.76
So it was.

2042
01:39:25.76 --> 01:39:28.76
Hender or think it was how like with a holiday.

2043
01:39:28.76 --> 01:39:30.76
And he's, but he's double like him.

2044
01:39:30.76 --> 01:39:31.76
You know what I mean?

2045
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:32.76
Yeah.

2046
01:39:32.76 --> 01:39:34.76
Sarge has got like the savage double.

2047
01:39:34.76 --> 01:39:36.76
Yeah.

2048
01:39:36.76 --> 01:39:38.76
It's another thing where I see these.

2049
01:39:38.76 --> 01:39:42.76
Brian, we're talking about Brian Sarge and one of my buddies who has a

2050
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:44.76
judicial school in Connecticut.

2051
01:39:44.76 --> 01:39:46.76
It's called Jitu Life.

2052
01:39:46.76 --> 01:39:50.76
But he has, he's a good wrestler.

2053
01:39:50.76 --> 01:39:54.76
But when I see these kids, and he, he wrestled at Powerway High School,

2054
01:39:54.76 --> 01:39:59.76
which is, uh, one of the best wrestling high schools.

2055
01:39:59.76 --> 01:40:00.76
Maybe in the country.

2056
01:40:00.76 --> 01:40:03.76
I mean, it's definitely incredible program.

2057
01:40:03.76 --> 01:40:05.76
And he went there and wrestled there.

2058
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:10.76
And I see occasionally I'll see a kid that just has Sarge's attitude.

2059
01:40:10.76 --> 01:40:12.76
And I saw one of this last tournament.

2060
01:40:12.76 --> 01:40:17.76
This kid was just all over hit and I mean, it looked, it didn't look fair.

2061
01:40:17.76 --> 01:40:18.76
Right.

2062
01:40:18.76 --> 01:40:20.76
I mean, he was just murdering this kid from Powerway.

2063
01:40:20.76 --> 01:40:22.76
It was getting after his pretty awesome watch.

2064
01:40:22.76 --> 01:40:26.76
And you could see just boom, boom, boom is hitting the doubles.

2065
01:40:26.76 --> 01:40:32.76
But it reminded me of the iconic picture of Sarge.

2066
01:40:32.76 --> 01:40:33.76
Oh, there's a picture of it.

2067
01:40:33.76 --> 01:40:36.76
So yeah, there's a picture of Sarge and they put him on.

2068
01:40:36.76 --> 01:40:40.76
It was, it was one of those pictures that was so good that they put it, like on the

2069
01:40:40.76 --> 01:40:44.76
cover, I think, I don't know if it was that one or for happened later in the match.

2070
01:40:44.76 --> 01:40:47.76
He was double-legging him out of bounds.

2071
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:48.76
He was in the table.

2072
01:40:48.76 --> 01:40:50.76
Yeah, it was a table may come.

2073
01:40:50.76 --> 01:40:54.76
So yeah, you got to watch out for Sarge's double-legged.

2074
01:40:54.76 --> 01:40:57.76
It'll put you on your ass quick.

2075
01:40:57.76 --> 01:41:00.76
And he won two Sarge won.

2076
01:41:00.76 --> 01:41:01.76
Hard to submit.

2077
01:41:01.76 --> 01:41:03.76
So like, you just got taken down.

2078
01:41:03.76 --> 01:41:05.76
That's two points.

2079
01:41:05.76 --> 01:41:06.76
Right.

2080
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:07.76
And now what are you going to do?

2081
01:41:07.76 --> 01:41:09.76
Because you can't sweep Sarge.

2082
01:41:09.76 --> 01:41:10.76
Right.

2083
01:41:10.76 --> 01:41:11.76
Hard.

2084
01:41:11.76 --> 01:41:12.76
I mean, of course I can, but it's hard.

2085
01:41:12.76 --> 01:41:13.76
Yeah.

2086
01:41:13.76 --> 01:41:14.76
You only have a few minutes.

2087
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:16.76
And it's hard to submit.

2088
01:41:16.76 --> 01:41:17.76
Oh, but you got back to your feet.

2089
01:41:17.76 --> 01:41:18.76
Cool.

2090
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:19.76
You just got taken down again.

2091
01:41:19.76 --> 01:41:20.76
Yeah.

2092
01:41:20.76 --> 01:41:24.76
Yeah, that's the rub with the real good judo guys are wrestling guys.

2093
01:41:24.76 --> 01:41:25.76
That's the rub.

2094
01:41:25.76 --> 01:41:26.76
What's the rub?

2095
01:41:26.76 --> 01:41:27.76
Oh, how do you solve that problem?

2096
01:41:27.76 --> 01:41:29.76
Yeah, it'll become a better wrestling.

2097
01:41:29.76 --> 01:41:31.76
But typically that's not it.

2098
01:41:31.76 --> 01:41:32.76
Yeah.

2099
01:41:32.76 --> 01:41:33.76
Because I run a woodley.

2100
01:41:33.76 --> 01:41:34.76
Tyron Woodley fought.

2101
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:35.76
Damien Mayer.

2102
01:41:35.76 --> 01:41:39.76
And Damien is an incredible judo to player.

2103
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:42.76
And he couldn't get Tyron down to the map.

2104
01:41:42.76 --> 01:41:45.76
And every time he shot, I would hit my son.

2105
01:41:45.76 --> 01:41:49.76
And because every time every time Damien shot,

2106
01:41:49.76 --> 01:41:51.76
he would's Tyron would just stuff the shot.

2107
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:53.76
And I hit my son and go, that's why you wrestle.

2108
01:41:53.76 --> 01:41:55.76
That's why you wrestle boy.

2109
01:41:55.76 --> 01:41:57.76
Because you're going to be able to take people down.

2110
01:41:57.76 --> 01:41:58.76
Yeah.

2111
01:41:58.76 --> 01:42:00.76
And then once you get to the ground, if you have the judo too,

2112
01:42:00.76 --> 01:42:01.76
well now you got problems.

2113
01:42:01.76 --> 01:42:02.76
Yeah.

2114
01:42:02.76 --> 01:42:04.76
Because Tyron didn't want to go to the ground with Damien.

2115
01:42:04.76 --> 01:42:05.76
No.

2116
01:42:05.76 --> 01:42:07.76
Because that would have been very problematic for him.

2117
01:42:07.76 --> 01:42:10.76
But Tyron Woodley is a wrestler.

2118
01:42:10.76 --> 01:42:11.76
Oh, yeah.

2119
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:16.76
Was that you who said there's a difference between someone who can wrestle versus a wrestler?

2120
01:42:16.76 --> 01:42:17.76
Yes, well that's the same.

2121
01:42:17.76 --> 01:42:18.76
Yes.

2122
01:42:18.76 --> 01:42:18.76
Yes.

2123
01:42:18.76 --> 01:42:19.76
Tarsal Leisure.

2124
01:42:19.76 --> 01:42:21.76
And that's why I say that's not the problem.

2125
01:42:21.76 --> 01:42:24.76
That's why I say that's not the solution.

2126
01:42:24.76 --> 01:42:27.76
You have a wrestler always taking you down and the solution is to get better wrestling.

2127
01:42:27.76 --> 01:42:32.76
The sound solution because you want to get better at something that this guy is probably getting better.

2128
01:42:32.76 --> 01:42:34.76
And this is just chances are I'm not saying that to that.

2129
01:42:34.76 --> 01:42:36.76
But he's probably a getting better.

2130
01:42:36.76 --> 01:42:38.76
B already super good at it.

2131
01:42:38.76 --> 01:42:40.76
So it's like the solution is to chase something.

2132
01:42:40.76 --> 01:42:41.76
That's 12 years ahead of you.

2133
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:42.76
Yeah.

2134
01:42:42.76 --> 01:42:44.76
He's eight years ahead of you in wrestling.

2135
01:42:44.76 --> 01:42:45.76
Yeah.

2136
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:47.76
So that's not the solution.

2137
01:42:47.76 --> 01:42:48.76
I don't know what this is.

2138
01:42:48.76 --> 01:42:49.76
I'm not saying don't wrestle.

2139
01:42:49.76 --> 01:42:50.76
Well, I think I'll tell you what this is.

2140
01:42:50.76 --> 01:42:52.76
What I think the solution is off the top of my head.

2141
01:42:52.76 --> 01:42:55.76
You learn enough wrestling and then you figure out how to incorporate your

2142
01:42:55.76 --> 01:43:01.76
jujitsu into the wrestling so that and I say this all the time and Dean will tell you the same thing.

2143
01:43:01.76 --> 01:43:06.76
Dean will a Dean will hesitate to shoot on me because he knows there's

2144
01:43:06.76 --> 01:43:08.76
significant threats there.

2145
01:43:08.76 --> 01:43:11.76
He'll shoot all day on a good wrestler because he doesn't care what happens.

2146
01:43:11.76 --> 01:43:13.76
They're not going to catch him most likely.

2147
01:43:13.76 --> 01:43:16.76
I mean obviously a jujitsu wrestler can happen.

2148
01:43:16.76 --> 01:43:19.76
But and I feel the same way.

2149
01:43:19.76 --> 01:43:22.76
I'll shoot all shoot all day on a good wrestler because I don't care.

2150
01:43:22.76 --> 01:43:24.76
They're not going to catch me anything and if they do,

2151
01:43:24.76 --> 01:43:27.76
be able to do the proper defense and escape it.

2152
01:43:27.76 --> 01:43:30.76
But Dean, no, like no, that's a real problem.

2153
01:43:30.76 --> 01:43:31.76
Yeah.

2154
01:43:31.76 --> 01:43:32.76
Same with Andy, you shoot on Andy.

2155
01:43:32.76 --> 01:43:34.76
You know, it's like, okay, that could be problematic.

2156
01:43:34.76 --> 01:43:35.76
Yeah.

2157
01:43:35.76 --> 01:43:36.76
And not even just pay for it.

2158
01:43:36.76 --> 01:43:37.76
You can lose right there.

2159
01:43:37.76 --> 01:43:38.76
Yeah.

2160
01:43:38.76 --> 01:43:39.76
Yeah.

2161
01:43:39.76 --> 01:43:42.76
Andy and I'm going to problem whoever shoots, whoever shoots,

2162
01:43:42.76 --> 01:43:43.76
loses.

2163
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:44.76
Yeah.

2164
01:43:44.76 --> 01:43:47.76
Because we're both have good anti wrestling.

2165
01:43:47.76 --> 01:43:49.76
So yeah, that's it.

2166
01:43:49.76 --> 01:43:51.76
That's the that's the solution right there.

2167
01:43:51.76 --> 01:43:54.76
You have to figure out the the counter the crypto to the wrestling.

2168
01:43:54.76 --> 01:43:55.76
Right.

2169
01:43:55.76 --> 01:43:57.76
And whatever way, because that's not just do that.

2170
01:43:57.76 --> 01:43:58.76
That's not how it is.

2171
01:43:58.76 --> 01:44:01.76
It's but that's the direction that's the solution.

2172
01:44:01.76 --> 01:44:01.76
Yeah.

2173
01:44:01.76 --> 01:44:04.76
And there's there's problems with that.

2174
01:44:04.76 --> 01:44:10.76
Well, there's not problems that one of the easiest ways is to be very.

2175
01:44:10.76 --> 01:44:13.76
I guess this is a problem is to be very.

2176
01:44:13.76 --> 01:44:15.76
Non aggressive.

2177
01:44:15.76 --> 01:44:19.76
Because if all you're trying to do is avoid getting taken down.

2178
01:44:19.76 --> 01:44:26.76
You already are are a lot harder to take down than if you like if I go in and start trying to take down a wrestler,

2179
01:44:26.76 --> 01:44:29.76
they're going to put me on my ass because I'm trying to take them in.

2180
01:44:29.76 --> 01:44:31.76
They know their counters that much better.

2181
01:44:31.76 --> 01:44:32.76
They're timing that much better.

2182
01:44:32.76 --> 01:44:33.76
They hit the switch.

2183
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:34.76
I'll also I'm down.

2184
01:44:34.76 --> 01:44:34.76
Yeah.

2185
01:44:34.76 --> 01:44:39.76
You know, but if I'm just trying to avoid you, it's the same thing with someone that's really good.

2186
01:44:39.76 --> 01:44:43.76
Strik if you're just if your goal is that if you start striking with a striker that's better than you,

2187
01:44:43.76 --> 01:44:45.76
you are more likely to get knocked out.

2188
01:44:45.76 --> 01:44:48.76
You're more likely to get hit because you're playing there.

2189
01:44:48.76 --> 01:44:49.76
That's the point.

2190
01:44:49.76 --> 01:44:50.76
You're playing their game.

2191
01:44:50.76 --> 01:44:51.76
Yeah.

2192
01:44:51.76 --> 01:44:52.76
And you don't want to play their game.

2193
01:44:52.76 --> 01:44:56.76
Now what sucks about that and it even happened the time would be fight.

2194
01:44:56.76 --> 01:44:59.76
It was a boring fight because it was shots getting stuffed.

2195
01:44:59.76 --> 01:45:00.76
Yeah.

2196
01:45:00.76 --> 01:45:00.76
Stand up.

2197
01:45:00.76 --> 01:45:02.76
It was a little bit some striking shots getting stuffed.

2198
01:45:02.76 --> 01:45:03.76
Stand up.

2199
01:45:03.76 --> 01:45:04.76
Striking shots getting stuffed.

2200
01:45:04.76 --> 01:45:05.76
That's what the fight was.

2201
01:45:05.76 --> 01:45:10.76
It was a very boring fight because his goal is to not get taken down.

2202
01:45:10.76 --> 01:45:13.76
And he's a wrestler so he had the capability of doing it.

2203
01:45:13.76 --> 01:45:14.76
And now was that.

2204
01:45:14.76 --> 01:45:16.76
I'll tell you what it did.

2205
01:45:16.76 --> 01:45:20.76
What you do for for wrestling situation is one of those simple.

2206
01:45:20.76 --> 01:45:23.76
It's not easy at all, but simple.

2207
01:45:23.76 --> 01:45:28.76
You find a way to get to the back from the bottom.

2208
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:28.76
Whoa.

2209
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:29.76
Yeah.

2210
01:45:29.76 --> 01:45:30.76
That's great.

2211
01:45:30.76 --> 01:45:31.76
I mean, yeah.

2212
01:45:31.76 --> 01:45:32.76
You find a way to submit one.

2213
01:45:32.76 --> 01:45:33.76
That's great.

2214
01:45:33.76 --> 01:45:34.76
Right.

2215
01:45:34.76 --> 01:45:35.76
No, no, no.

2216
01:45:35.76 --> 01:45:37.76
Like get to the back because dip it in under the wall.

2217
01:45:37.76 --> 01:45:40.76
You can't get on there.

2218
01:45:40.76 --> 01:45:43.76
I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm there.

2219
01:45:43.76 --> 01:45:46.76
He was, he told me this when he was going to chill so on and for Metamores.

2220
01:45:46.76 --> 01:45:49.76
And he was like, he's like, yeah, it's interesting fighting wrestlers or whatever.

2221
01:45:49.76 --> 01:45:52.76
It's like they can provide like that totally paraphrasing.

2222
01:45:52.76 --> 01:45:56.76
They can provide these really hard situations for you in

2223
01:45:56.76 --> 01:45:58.76
Jiu Jitsu for many reasons.

2224
01:45:58.76 --> 01:46:00.76
They're super hard people to fight.

2225
01:46:00.76 --> 01:46:06.76
But if you can figure it out, you got to figure out ways where wrestling provides weaknesses in

2226
01:46:06.76 --> 01:46:07.76
a Jiu Jitsu scenario.

2227
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:08.76
Yeah.

2228
01:46:08.76 --> 01:46:11.76
And then if you watch the match, sure enough, like he was,

2229
01:46:11.76 --> 01:46:18.76
She'll sign it was really good at stuffing stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff and then you could see govels like just slowly and then you got to the back.

2230
01:46:18.76 --> 01:46:19.76
Yeah.

2231
01:46:19.76 --> 01:46:30.76
And I used to coach Dean with the same idea of, you know, if you was going against a good wrestler, I'd say use your Jiu Jitsu if he's going against a good Jiu Jitsu guy to use your wrestling.

2232
01:46:30.76 --> 01:46:35.76
Dean would have a tendency because of his personality to want to go against

2233
01:46:35.76 --> 01:46:36.76
them in their strength.

2234
01:46:36.76 --> 01:46:39.76
So he trying to out wrestle wrestlers.

2235
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:41.76
He trying out Jiu Jitsu out Jiu Jitsu guys.

2236
01:46:41.76 --> 01:46:45.76
He would, that's his natural tendency would be to go at people's strengths.

2237
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:56.76
And I'd have to like say no, do Jiu Jitsu against this guy and then he do it and get what we need to get.

2238
01:46:56.76 --> 01:46:58.76
All right.

2239
01:46:58.76 --> 01:46:59.76
Back to the book.

2240
01:46:59.76 --> 01:47:15.76
When one is obliged to defend entrenchments, one should post all the battions directly behind the parapet because if once the enemy sets foot upon that, those in the rear will think of nothing but to save themselves.

2241
01:47:15.76 --> 01:47:23.76
This is because of the consternation in men when something happens that they have not expected.

2242
01:47:23.76 --> 01:47:26.76
Again, consternation is like shock.

2243
01:47:26.76 --> 01:47:36.76
So he's again emphasizing the fact that when people aren't expecting something, it is a, it's a major down or for it.

2244
01:47:36.76 --> 01:47:37.76
It's a major down for it.

2245
01:47:37.76 --> 01:47:39.76
It interrupts what's happening.

2246
01:47:39.76 --> 01:47:40.76
Yeah.

2247
01:47:40.76 --> 01:47:41.76
And that's why you gotta think of contingencies.

2248
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:46.76
That's one of the biggest things, well, one of the best things about thinking about contingencies is just that you're aware of it.

2249
01:47:46.76 --> 01:47:49.76
It's going to, just that you thought about it for a half a second.

2250
01:47:49.76 --> 01:47:50.76
Big two.

2251
01:47:50.76 --> 01:47:54.76
That makes you so much better off getting caught completely, getting caught completely off guard.

2252
01:47:54.76 --> 01:47:55.76
I mean, this happens in Jiu Jitsu.

2253
01:47:55.76 --> 01:47:58.76
The thing that you get caught with is the thing that you didn't see coming.

2254
01:47:58.76 --> 01:48:00.76
That's the thing that catches you.

2255
01:48:00.76 --> 01:48:03.76
The thing that surprises you and you're like, how that happened.

2256
01:48:03.76 --> 01:48:03.76
Yeah.

2257
01:48:03.76 --> 01:48:04.76
It surprises you.

2258
01:48:04.76 --> 01:48:05.76
That's what you get caught with.

2259
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:13.76
You know, even like in your house, like that's the one I think of a lot where you know when you're in your house and if you think of like what if there's someone in here.

2260
01:48:13.76 --> 01:48:14.76
Oh, yeah.

2261
01:48:14.76 --> 01:48:14.76
Right now.

2262
01:48:14.76 --> 01:48:15.76
Yeah.

2263
01:48:15.76 --> 01:48:20.76
You're not even necessarily of how scary that would be necessarily, but it's like, okay, what if there's someone in here?

2264
01:48:20.76 --> 01:48:23.76
At least I'm ready for the fact that someone's in here.

2265
01:48:23.76 --> 01:48:27.76
My daughter, my eight-year-old daughter, will try and scare me.

2266
01:48:27.76 --> 01:48:28.76
Yeah.

2267
01:48:28.76 --> 01:48:31.76
And she'll hide somewhere.

2268
01:48:31.76 --> 01:48:34.76
And if I don't expect it, I get started.

2269
01:48:34.76 --> 01:48:35.76
You'll get, yeah.

2270
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:36.76
That's you.

2271
01:48:36.76 --> 01:48:39.76
And then what I do is I just, you know, you're talking about punishment.

2272
01:48:39.76 --> 01:48:41.76
No, what I know, I punish myself.

2273
01:48:41.76 --> 01:48:42.76
Oh, he's almost scared.

2274
01:48:42.76 --> 01:48:43.76
Yeah.

2275
01:48:43.76 --> 01:48:46.76
So she's, she's scared me twice last year.

2276
01:48:46.76 --> 01:48:48.76
Like that actually made me a little bit startled.

2277
01:48:48.76 --> 01:48:50.76
She tried 98 times.

2278
01:48:50.76 --> 01:48:53.76
96 of them were ineffective.

2279
01:48:53.76 --> 01:48:54.76
All right.

2280
01:48:54.76 --> 01:48:55.76
But I'll say what?

2281
01:48:55.76 --> 01:48:56.76
I punish myself.

2282
01:48:56.76 --> 01:48:58.76
Yeah, well, I'm going to be a good person.

2283
01:48:58.76 --> 01:48:59.76
I'm going to be a good person.

2284
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:00.76
Burpee school.

2285
01:49:00.76 --> 01:49:02.76
And then, but I really enjoy scaring people.

2286
01:49:02.76 --> 01:49:03.76
Sure.

2287
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:04.76
A lot.

2288
01:49:04.76 --> 01:49:05.76
I don't know why.

2289
01:49:05.76 --> 01:49:08.76
I find it very entertaining and funny and satisfying.

2290
01:49:08.76 --> 01:49:13.76
So I do, when I scare people, like, makes them cry.

2291
01:49:13.76 --> 01:49:14.76
Yeah.

2292
01:49:14.76 --> 01:49:15.76
Yeah.

2293
01:49:15.76 --> 01:49:16.76
Wait, wait.

2294
01:49:16.76 --> 01:49:17.76
I still have you scared.

2295
01:49:17.76 --> 01:49:19.76
Do you do the loud noise one or do you?

2296
01:49:19.76 --> 01:49:20.76
Yeah.

2297
01:49:20.76 --> 01:49:22.76
You know, because a lot of times the loud noise isn't the scary thing.

2298
01:49:22.76 --> 01:49:23.76
Right.

2299
01:49:23.76 --> 01:49:25.76
Sometimes, the scratching at the window is a lot.

2300
01:49:25.76 --> 01:49:26.76
Yeah.

2301
01:49:26.76 --> 01:49:27.76
Yeah.

2302
01:49:27.76 --> 01:49:28.76
Sometimes, you think you're home alone.

2303
01:49:28.76 --> 01:49:29.76
You think your dad's calling.

2304
01:49:29.76 --> 01:49:31.76
But then, on the other side, there's like scratching at the window.

2305
01:49:31.76 --> 01:49:32.76
And there's a noise at the door opening.

2306
01:49:32.76 --> 01:49:33.76
And you start calling out for your dad.

2307
01:49:33.76 --> 01:49:34.76
But he doesn't answer.

2308
01:49:34.76 --> 01:49:36.76
And then there's more scratching at the window.

2309
01:49:36.76 --> 01:49:39.76
And then all of a sudden, there's someone with a mask on that comes a little bit.

2310
01:49:39.76 --> 01:49:40.76
But the fries.

2311
01:49:40.76 --> 01:49:41.76
Yeah.

2312
01:49:41.76 --> 01:49:42.76
You can do that, Brad.

2313
01:49:42.76 --> 01:49:43.76
That's like, that's a violation.

2314
01:49:43.76 --> 01:49:44.76
You can't do that.

2315
01:49:44.76 --> 01:49:45.76
No, man.

2316
01:49:45.76 --> 01:49:46.76
I do do that.

2317
01:49:46.76 --> 01:49:47.76
Yeah.

2318
01:49:47.76 --> 01:49:48.76
Yeah.

2319
01:49:48.76 --> 01:49:51.76
Back to the book.

2320
01:49:51.76 --> 01:49:59.76
Well, let me catch this up to where we're talking about the shock that happens when people

2321
01:49:59.76 --> 01:50:00.76
don't expect something.

2322
01:50:00.76 --> 01:50:01.76
Back to the book.

2323
01:50:01.76 --> 01:50:07.76
This is a general rule in war and decides all battles and all actions.

2324
01:50:07.76 --> 01:50:11.76
It comes from the human heart and is what induced me to compose this work.

2325
01:50:11.76 --> 01:50:17.76
I do not believe that anyone yet has attempted to find their, find their the reasons for the poor

2326
01:50:17.76 --> 01:50:18.76
success of armies.

2327
01:50:18.76 --> 01:50:23.76
Thus, when you have stationed your troops behind a pair of put they hope by their fire

2328
01:50:23.76 --> 01:50:26.76
to prevent the enemy from passing the ditch and mounting it.

2329
01:50:26.76 --> 01:50:31.76
If this happens and spite of the fire, they give themselves up for lost, lose their heads and fly.

2330
01:50:31.76 --> 01:50:36.76
They would be much better to post a single rank there, armed with pikes, whose business will be to push

2331
01:50:36.76 --> 01:50:39.76
the mainland back as fast as they attempt to mount.

2332
01:50:39.76 --> 01:50:46.76
And certainly, they will execute this duty because it is what they expect and what they prepared for.

2333
01:50:46.76 --> 01:50:53.76
If with this, you post infantry formed according to my method into centuries at a distance of 30

2334
01:50:53.76 --> 01:50:59.76
paces from the entrenchment, these troops will see that they are placed there to charge the enemy

2335
01:50:59.76 --> 01:51:02.76
as fast as he enters and attempts to form.

2336
01:51:02.76 --> 01:51:09.76
They will not be astonished to see the enemy enter because they expect it and will charge vigorously.

2337
01:51:09.76 --> 01:51:14.76
Instead, if instead they had been placed on the parapet, they would have fled.

2338
01:51:14.76 --> 01:51:21.76
That is how a trifle changes everything in war and how human weaknesses cannot be managed

2339
01:51:21.76 --> 01:51:26.76
except by allowing for them.

2340
01:51:26.76 --> 01:51:29.76
That's heavy right there.

2341
01:51:29.76 --> 01:51:32.76
Human weaknesses cannot be managed.

2342
01:51:32.76 --> 01:51:35.76
You have to allow for them to think about that.

2343
01:51:35.76 --> 01:51:37.76
You have to do that all the time as a leader.

2344
01:51:37.76 --> 01:51:39.76
You have to try and do it as a leader.

2345
01:51:39.76 --> 01:51:47.76
Because if you don't try and manage these weaknesses, you don't allow for them, then they're going to jam

2346
01:51:47.76 --> 01:51:49.76
you up as you would say.

2347
01:51:49.76 --> 01:51:56.76
So you have to put them in a situation where that ego is going to flourish and not be offended

2348
01:51:56.76 --> 01:52:00.76
and when it does get offended, you have to allow for that and how you are going to adapt to it.

2349
01:52:00.76 --> 01:52:05.76
It's like expecting perfection, you know, like if you expect perfection.

2350
01:52:05.76 --> 01:52:10.76
Well, you're going to be let down a bunch.

2351
01:52:10.76 --> 01:52:11.76
Yeah, this is what I'm saying.

2352
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:15.76
So if you allow for imperfection, you can just manage better.

2353
01:52:15.76 --> 01:52:17.76
So there's two major points.

2354
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:21.76
You know, number one, if you set people up so that what they expect to happen happens, they're going to have a better

2355
01:52:21.76 --> 01:52:25.76
chance of achieving what it is you want them to achieve.

2356
01:52:25.76 --> 01:52:30.76
Because if these guys are in the parapet and all of a sudden they get run upon and they're surprised by it

2357
01:52:30.76 --> 01:52:32.76
and their mission was to defend the parapet.

2358
01:52:32.76 --> 01:52:35.76
Well, now they're getting overrun.

2359
01:52:35.76 --> 01:52:38.76
Whereas if you say no once they get parapet gets taken, you attack.

2360
01:52:38.76 --> 01:52:41.76
Now they know the parapets and they're not going to be surprised, they expect to happen

2361
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:45.76
and then when they get the opportunity they're going to get in there and get after it.

2362
01:52:45.76 --> 01:52:53.76
But man, allowing the manage, managing human weakness, the only way you can do is by allowing for it.

2363
01:52:53.76 --> 01:52:56.76
At least some measure of it.

2364
01:52:56.76 --> 01:52:58.76
Good.

2365
01:52:58.76 --> 01:53:02.76
Good lesson learned that something you can think about as you lead people.

2366
01:53:02.76 --> 01:53:05.76
You can think about, hey man, this is a little weakness here.

2367
01:53:05.76 --> 01:53:08.76
And if I don't allow for that, I don't give that some room.

2368
01:53:08.76 --> 01:53:14.76
And I count on you know, a Flynn from National Unfront newest member of National Unfront.

2369
01:53:14.76 --> 01:53:19.76
But he just wrote an article about a guy he was stationed on a ship before he got to the teams.

2370
01:53:19.76 --> 01:53:25.76
And he was saying this guy had been late for work.

2371
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:28.76
And but he was trying to bring the guy along had a lot of potential blah, blah, blah.

2372
01:53:28.76 --> 01:53:36.76
Anyways, they go to actually do an important training with their weapons on the ship that they were on.

2373
01:53:36.76 --> 01:53:40.76
And the guy missed the ship leaving port.

2374
01:53:40.76 --> 01:53:44.76
And he says, you know, I should have fired the guy before this.

2375
01:53:44.76 --> 01:53:45.76
And now I'm out here.

2376
01:53:45.76 --> 01:53:50.76
I don't have this primary guy and you let down me and let down the ship and everything like that.

2377
01:53:50.76 --> 01:53:52.76
But he didn't account for human weakness.

2378
01:53:52.76 --> 01:53:55.76
He thought that he could bring this guy along, but he just, you know, it's one of those things.

2379
01:53:55.76 --> 01:54:00.76
If you don't allow for that human weakness in there, you might be, you might be getting left high and dry.

2380
01:54:00.76 --> 01:54:10.76
Which is not good. That's in the, made that thing on the echelon front web page, which is called.

2381
01:54:10.76 --> 01:54:11.76
But we'll tune up.

2382
01:54:11.76 --> 01:54:12.76
Yeah.

2383
01:54:12.76 --> 01:54:13.76
And we're just like writing little.

2384
01:54:13.76 --> 01:54:17.76
I guess it could be referred to as a blog.

2385
01:54:17.76 --> 01:54:22.76
It's not really a blog because a blog to me seems very, you know, just say we're just going to write whatever blog.

2386
01:54:22.76 --> 01:54:23.76
Yeah.

2387
01:54:23.76 --> 01:54:27.76
So this is some little, I guess you might want to call them articles.

2388
01:54:27.76 --> 01:54:27.76
Yeah.

2389
01:54:27.76 --> 01:54:29.76
And there's like let, like let little lessons.

2390
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:30.76
Yeah.

2391
01:54:30.76 --> 01:54:30.76
Yeah.

2392
01:54:30.76 --> 01:54:31.76
Yeah.

2393
01:54:31.76 --> 01:54:32.76
I like to enjoy.

2394
01:54:32.76 --> 01:54:34.76
I'm going to put you in the whole time.

2395
01:54:34.76 --> 01:54:41.76
And the reason we call the Paltoon Hunt is because that's where you'd sit around and talk shop.

2396
01:54:41.76 --> 01:54:43.76
I guess we talk about other things.

2397
01:54:43.76 --> 01:54:46.76
But when you get back from a training op, because when you're overseas, you, you, you

2398
01:54:46.76 --> 01:54:48.76
still have a Paltoon Hunt, but it's not the Paltoon Hunt.

2399
01:54:48.76 --> 01:54:49.76
I guess it is the Paltoon Hunt.

2400
01:54:49.76 --> 01:54:50.76
But anyways, yeah, even there.

2401
01:54:50.76 --> 01:54:52.76
So when you get back from an operation, you're coming to debriefing you.

2402
01:54:52.76 --> 01:54:55.76
You get done with the official debriefing, but then you go into the Paltoon Hunt.

2403
01:54:55.76 --> 01:54:56.76
Yeah.

2404
01:54:56.76 --> 01:54:56.76
Yeah.

2405
01:54:56.76 --> 01:54:57.76
I think you should do this.

2406
01:54:57.76 --> 01:54:58.76
And so yeah.

2407
01:54:58.76 --> 01:54:59.76
So that's one of those.

2408
01:54:59.76 --> 01:55:08.76
He, as a young, a surface warfare officer in the Navy, didn't allow for the human weakness of this young sailor.

2409
01:55:08.76 --> 01:55:09.76
And it cost him.

2410
01:55:12.76 --> 01:55:14.76
Going back to the book.

2411
01:55:14.76 --> 01:55:19.76
The Greeks were very skillful in the art of war and well-discipline.

2412
01:55:19.76 --> 01:55:28.76
But their large phalanx was never able to contend with the small bodies of Romans disposed in this formation.

2413
01:55:28.76 --> 01:55:33.76
Now he goes on to, there's a guy named Polybius.

2414
01:55:33.76 --> 01:55:38.76
And he goes on to quote a huge chunk of text from Polybius.

2415
01:55:38.76 --> 01:55:48.76
Polybius was a Greek historian and Polybius actually talked about why the Roman armies could defeat the failings.

2416
01:55:48.76 --> 01:55:53.76
And pretty interesting.

2417
01:55:53.76 --> 01:55:55.76
So here's what he said.

2418
01:55:55.76 --> 01:56:02.76
It is easy to demonstrate by many reasons that while the failings retain its proper form and full power of action,

2419
01:56:02.76 --> 01:56:08.76
no forces able to stand against it in front or in support of the violent attacks.

2420
01:56:08.76 --> 01:56:12.76
So while the failings is in order, you're not going to be able to defeat it.

2421
01:56:12.76 --> 01:56:15.76
So the failings is a military formation.

2422
01:56:15.76 --> 01:56:19.76
And he talks a little bit about what it's made up of here.

2423
01:56:19.76 --> 01:56:25.76
When the ranks are closed in order to engage each soldier, as he stands with his arms,

2424
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:27.76
occupies a space of three feet.

2425
01:56:27.76 --> 01:56:33.76
The spears in their ancient form were 17 qubits long, a qubit is about 18 inches.

2426
01:56:33.76 --> 01:56:40.76
But for the sake of rendering them more comodious in actions, they have since been reduced to 14.

2427
01:56:40.76 --> 01:56:52.76
Of these four qubits are contained between the part which the soldier grasps in his hands and the lower end of the spear behind which serves as a counterpoise to the part that is extended before him.

2428
01:56:52.76 --> 01:57:04.76
And when the length of this last part from the body of the soldier when the spear is pushed forwards with both hands against the enemy is in consequence ten qubits.

2429
01:57:04.76 --> 01:57:09.76
From hands it follows that when the failings is closed in its proper form,

2430
01:57:09.76 --> 01:57:15.76
every soldier pressed within the necessary distance with respect to the man that is before him.

2431
01:57:15.76 --> 01:57:20.76
And on his side, the spears of the fifth rank are extended to the length of two qubits.

2432
01:57:20.76 --> 01:57:25.76
And those of the second third and fourth to a still greater length beyond the foremost rank.

2433
01:57:25.76 --> 01:57:37.76
It is manifest then that several spears differing each other in the length of two qubits are extended before every man in the foremost rank.

2434
01:57:37.76 --> 01:57:49.76
And when it is considered likewise that the failings is formed by sixteen in depth, it will be easy to conceive what must be the weight and violence of the entire body and how great.

2435
01:57:49.76 --> 01:57:53.76
The force of its attack. So you got guys.

2436
01:57:53.76 --> 01:58:03.76
Sixteen people deep, sixteen people deep and they've got these spears and they adjust the spears depending on where you are in the rank.

2437
01:58:03.76 --> 01:58:08.76
So the guy that's five ranks back still has a little bit of his spear sticking out.

2438
01:58:08.76 --> 01:58:14.76
And by the way, if one of those guys goes down there's another fourteen people there ready to take his place.

2439
01:58:14.76 --> 01:58:24.76
So the failings will lock together the shields protecting the person to your left. And it's like a porcupine of depth locked together.

2440
01:58:24.76 --> 01:58:31.76
And obviously the Greeks were hardcore warriors.

2441
01:58:31.76 --> 01:58:36.76
And this is what they use and they use to crush people with this failings.

2442
01:58:36.76 --> 01:58:40.76
Crush them. Spears and shields. That's all you see.

2443
01:58:40.76 --> 01:58:47.76
Now, Polybius talks about what the Romans did and what their setup was.

2444
01:58:47.76 --> 01:58:53.76
Back to the book to each of the Roman soldiers as he stands in arms is a lot of the same space of three feet.

2445
01:58:53.76 --> 01:59:08.76
But as every soldier in time of action is constantly in motion being forced to shift this shield continuously so that he may cover any part of his body against which a stroke is aimed and to vary the position of his sword.

2446
01:59:08.76 --> 01:59:13.76
So as to either push or to make a falling stroke, there must be also a distance of three feet.

2447
01:59:13.76 --> 01:59:23.76
The least that can be allowed for performing these motions with advantage between each soldier and the man that stands next to him both on his side and behind him.

2448
01:59:23.76 --> 01:59:25.76
So the Romans are in the same similar position.

2449
01:59:25.76 --> 01:59:33.76
But they're moving individually inside these little positions. So they're not working together. They're more mobile.

2450
01:59:33.76 --> 01:59:45.76
It will be easy, therefore, to conceive that while the failings retain its proper position in strength, no troops as I have before observed can support the attack of it in front.

2451
01:59:45.76 --> 01:59:49.76
So if you're going to get to failings, you're going to lose. If you're going to front.

2452
01:59:49.76 --> 01:59:58.76
To what caused then is it described that the Roman armies are victorious and those defeated that employed the failings?

2453
01:59:58.76 --> 02:00:10.76
So how is it that the Romans were able to be the failings? This is the cause. In war, the times and places of action are various and indefinite.

2454
02:00:10.76 --> 02:00:19.76
But there is only one time in place, one fixed and determined manner of action that is suited to the failings.

2455
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:34.76
In the case of a general action, if an enemy be forced to encounter with the failings in the very time and place which the latter requires, it is probable in the highest degree that the failings must obtain victory.

2456
02:00:34.76 --> 02:00:43.76
So if you fight the failings where the failings wants you to fight it, meaning on a big open area, you're going to lose.

2457
02:00:43.76 --> 02:00:54.76
But if it is possible to avoid an engagement in such circumstances and it is indeed easy to do it, there is nothing to be dreaded from this order of battle.

2458
02:00:54.76 --> 02:01:06.76
And here's where it gets to the nitty-gritty. It is well-known and an acknowledged truth that the failings requires a ground that is plain and naked and free from obstacles of every kind, such as trenches, breaks and

2459
02:01:06.76 --> 02:01:17.76
and brows of hills or the channels of rivers and that any of these are sufficient to impede it and to dissolve it, the unto dissolve the order in which it was formed.

2460
02:01:17.76 --> 02:01:27.76
If the enemy coming down on it should lead their army through the country, plundering the cities and ravaging the lands of what use then will be the failings.

2461
02:01:27.76 --> 02:01:37.76
So all you have to do is get them on some rough terrain. You get them on some rough terrain and that failings, it's hard to march already. We know that but now we're marching against weird terrain.

2462
02:01:37.76 --> 02:01:45.76
And the guy in front of you trips and falls, well what does he hit, he hits a rock and now that makes this guy fall and all of a sudden we got a big disaster on our hands.

2463
02:01:45.76 --> 02:01:59.76
Back to the book, when the Romans attacked the failings and the front they never employ all their forces so as to make their line equal to that of the enemy but lead on only a part of their troops and the rest they keep in reserve.

2464
02:01:59.76 --> 02:02:08.76
Now whether the troops the failings break the line that is opposed to them or whether they are broken themselves, the formation peculiar to the failings is alike dissolved.

2465
02:02:08.76 --> 02:02:18.76
So even if they win that initial onslaught even if the failings wins that the failings is out of order.

2466
02:02:18.76 --> 02:02:26.76
If they pursue the fugitive or if on the other hand they retreat and are pursued in either case they are separated from the rest of their own body.

2467
02:02:26.76 --> 02:02:41.76
And thus there is left some space which the reserve of the Roman army takes care to seize and then charges the remaining part of the failings. But the charge is not made against the front but in the flank or the rear.

2468
02:02:41.76 --> 02:02:57.76
Since it is easy then to avoid the conditions that are favorable to the failings and since those on the contrary that are disinvenged disinventages to it can never be avoided it is certain that this difference alone must carry with it a decisive weight in time of action.

2469
02:02:57.76 --> 02:03:04.76
So let them get a little bit disrupted once they are disrupted flank them.

2470
02:03:04.76 --> 02:03:16.76
The troops of the failings lose all their strength when they engage in separate companies or man on man. The Roman order on the contrary is never attended even on such occasions with any disadvantage.

2471
02:03:16.76 --> 02:03:25.76
Among the Romans every single soldier when he is once armed and ready for service is a like fitted and engaged.

2472
02:03:25.76 --> 02:03:40.76
Fitted to engage in any time or place or in any appearance of the enemy and preserves that always the same power and the same capacity and action whether in separate companies or man to man.

2473
02:03:40.76 --> 02:04:07.76
So big destructive element in front of you don't go head on head with it we've learned this over and over again you might want to distract it sure. But then you hit him from the flank and don't face people on their best category right don't wrestle against the rest of their don't do to the two against the two guys don't box against the boxer don't go at them and don't do it where they want to do it.

2474
02:04:07.76 --> 02:04:13.76
That's real important disrupting the failings.

2475
02:04:13.76 --> 02:04:24.76
Now we talk about attacking entrenchments which again these are defensive positions when an entrenchment is to be attacked and attempt should be made to extend the lines as much as possible make sense right.

2476
02:04:24.76 --> 02:04:37.52
I just don't want to I want to let make the person think that we're going to attack him on the whole the whole line that he's got this will make the enemy fearful everywhere so that he will not withdraw troops from any point to reinforce that which you intend to

2477
02:04:37.52 --> 02:04:43.52
attack even after he discovers it. This makes many of his troops use this and this was D day so what we did on D day.

2478
02:04:43.52 --> 02:04:54.52
You know they did those massive deception operations the breads the Americans and built those fake tanks and fake planes and put them all they were inflatable you see that stuff right.

2479
02:04:54.52 --> 02:05:17.52
The Americans and the breads when we were trying to to confuse Hitler about where we were going to attack D day they made these they made like fake air planes and fake tanks and they put them in different locations that the indicated that we'd probably be attacking this spot instead of that spot and it all works.

2480
02:05:17.52 --> 02:05:30.52
And so he had to defend the whole line and actually defended those areas where they thought the attack was coming more than they defended the area or D day was a little deception operation.

2481
02:05:30.52 --> 02:05:45.52
Back to the book too much attention cannot be paid despise and guides they're like eyes and are equally necessary to a general he is too much money cannot be spent to get good ones.

2482
02:05:45.52 --> 02:05:54.52
These men should be chosen in the country where the war is being fought they should be intelligent cunning and discreet.

2483
02:05:54.52 --> 02:06:06.52
The commanding general I have formed a picture of a commanding general which is not chimera.

2484
02:06:06.52 --> 02:06:16.52
I have seen such men the first qualities the first of all qualities is courage without this the others are of little value since they cannot be used.

2485
02:06:16.52 --> 02:06:25.52
The second is intelligence which must be strong and fertile in expedience the third is health.

2486
02:06:25.52 --> 02:06:33.52
He should possess a talent for sudden and appropriate improvisation that's a good that's you don't expect that.

2487
02:06:33.52 --> 02:06:45.52
A talent for sudden and appropriate improvisation if I didn't make this clear enough he's kind of going through the characteristics that he believes a good commanding general should have.

2488
02:06:45.52 --> 02:06:53.52
He should be able to penetrate the minds of other men while remaining impenetrable himself.

2489
02:06:53.52 --> 02:07:02.52
He should be endowed with the capacity of being prepared for everything with the activity accompanied by judgment.

2490
02:07:02.52 --> 02:07:11.52
With the skill to make proper decision on all occasions and with exactness of discernment.

2491
02:07:11.52 --> 02:07:24.52
Good lists. He should have a good disposition free from from Caprice and be a stranger to hatred and Caprice is like you're just going to change your mind all the time.

2492
02:07:24.52 --> 02:07:34.52
He should punish without mercy, especially those who are dearest to him but never from anger.

2493
02:07:34.52 --> 02:07:40.52
Because remember earlier he was talking about being kind of chill with it with the last things.

2494
02:07:40.52 --> 02:07:44.52
But he says you should punish without mercy especially those who are dearest to you.

2495
02:07:44.52 --> 02:07:47.52
And I think that goes to what he was saying about troops.

2496
02:07:47.52 --> 02:07:51.52
You're going to draft people. You're going to make sure you draft the rich people too.

2497
02:07:51.52 --> 02:07:57.52
And I think he's saying you've got to treat people fairly, right? Even when you're even when it's on your own.

2498
02:07:57.52 --> 02:08:10.52
He should always be grieved when he is forced to execute the military rules and should have the example of manelius.

2499
02:08:10.52 --> 02:08:23.52
Constantly before his eyes and manly is actually actually manly is he was like a Roman hero during the Gallic siege.

2500
02:08:23.52 --> 02:08:35.52
And beyond that he was sort of like a, I want to call him a human rights advocate, but maybe that's too strong or but anyways he ended up getting a crucifix, not crucified.

2501
02:08:35.52 --> 02:08:36.52
From him.

2502
02:08:36.52 --> 02:08:40.52
From a great height and killed as execution.

2503
02:08:40.52 --> 02:08:50.52
But he sort of seen as a guy that stood up. He almost was in like an alamo scenario like in Texas when they, when they stood and were killed.

2504
02:08:50.52 --> 02:08:54.52
He was in one of those situations, but he wasn't killed during that Gallic siege room.

2505
02:08:54.52 --> 02:09:06.52
Anyways, back to the book. He should discard the idea that is he who punishes and should persuade himself and others that he only administer the military laws.

2506
02:09:06.52 --> 02:09:13.52
With these qualities, he will be loved. He will be feared and without doubt obeyed.

2507
02:09:13.52 --> 02:09:25.52
The functions of a general are infinite. He must know how to subsist his army and how to husband it, how to place it so that it will not be forced upon to fight except when he chooses.

2508
02:09:25.52 --> 02:09:33.52
How to form his troops in an infinity of different infinity of different dispositions.

2509
02:09:33.52 --> 02:09:40.52
How to profit from that favorable moment which occurs in all battles and which decides their success.

2510
02:09:40.52 --> 02:09:51.52
All these things are of immense importance and are as varied as the situations and dispositions which produce them.

2511
02:09:51.52 --> 02:10:03.52
In order to see all these things, the general should be occupied with nothing else the day of the battle, the inspection of the terrain and the disposition of his troops should be prompt like the flight of an eagle.

2512
02:10:03.52 --> 02:10:16.52
This done, his orders should be short and simple. As for instance, the first line of attack, the first line will attack and the second will be in support. Boom, that's it.

2513
02:10:16.52 --> 02:10:29.52
Keep it simple. The general's under his command must be incompetent indeed if they do not know how to execute this order and to perform the proper maneuvers with their respective divisions.

2514
02:10:29.52 --> 02:10:37.52
Thus the commander and chief will not be forced to occupy himself with it nor be embarrassed with the details.

2515
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:50.52
For if he temps to be a battle sergeant and be everywhere himself, he will resemble the fly in the fable that thought he was driving the coach.

2516
02:10:50.52 --> 02:10:54.52
Thus on the day of the battle, I should want the general to do nothing.

2517
02:10:54.52 --> 02:11:06.52
His observations will be better for it. His judgment will be more sane and he will be in a better state to profit from the situations in which the enemy finds himself during the engagement.

2518
02:11:06.52 --> 02:11:17.52
And when he sees an occasion, he should unleash his energies hastened to the critical point at top speed, seize the first troops available advanced and rapidly and lead them in person.

2519
02:11:17.52 --> 02:11:27.52
These are the strokes that decide battles or end game victories. The important thing is to see the opportunity and know how to use it.

2520
02:11:27.52 --> 02:11:33.52
So what he's saying there's got to be detached. He's saying you got to be detached and then you got to stay back and you got to look around now.

2521
02:11:33.52 --> 02:11:40.52
He also says once you see the critical moment, you got to get up in there and make it happen.

2522
02:11:40.52 --> 02:11:47.52
But he's saying you definitely can't get laid down in the weeds. You can't be the sergeant that's trying to do everything.

2523
02:11:47.52 --> 02:12:00.52
Back to the book, many commanding generals only spend their time on the day of the battle and making their troops march in a straight line and seeing that they keep their proper distances in answering questions which their aids to camp come to ask,

2524
02:12:00.52 --> 02:12:10.52
and they're not going to be able to do anything. They're not going to be able to do anything.

2525
02:12:10.52 --> 02:12:18.52
So this is a great, this is just, you're in a leadership position. You try and do everything yourself. You're not going to do anything at all.

2526
02:12:18.52 --> 02:12:28.52
Then it's the same, that's the same thing as prioritize next to you. If you try and solve all the problems that are happening at the same time, you're not going to solve any of those problems.

2527
02:12:28.52 --> 02:12:42.52
They appear to me like men with their heads turned, who no longer see anything and who are only able to do what they have done all their lives, which is to conduct troops methodically under their orders under the orders of a commander.

2528
02:12:42.52 --> 02:12:57.52
How does this happen? It is because very few men occupy themselves with the higher problems of war. They pass their lives drilling troops and believe that this is the only branch of the military act.

2529
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:09.52
When they arrive at the command of armies, they are totally ignorant and in default of knowing what should be done, they do what they know.

2530
02:13:09.52 --> 02:13:21.52
That is so classic. It's so classic. When people don't know, they don't understand something. They do what they know how to do. They they always default into what they know how to do.

2531
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:34.52
Their minds are closed. One of the branches of the art of war that is to say drill and the method of fighting is methodical. The other is intellectual.

2532
02:13:34.52 --> 02:13:41.52
For the conduct of the latter, it is essential that ordinary men should not be chosen.

2533
02:13:41.52 --> 02:13:56.52
Unless a man is born with a talent for war, you will never be other than a mediocre general. There's the same with all talents in painting or music or in poetry that talent must be inherent for excellence.

2534
02:13:56.52 --> 02:14:14.52
All sublime arts are alike in this respect. That is why we see so few outstanding men in science centuries past without producing one. Application rectifies ideas, but does not furnish a soul for that is the work of nature.

2535
02:14:14.52 --> 02:14:32.52
I just answered a question on Twitter. I basically said, well, you can't do whatever you want just because you believe in it. You have hard work and discipline.

2536
02:14:32.52 --> 02:14:45.52
That doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. Like as a career or something.

2537
02:14:45.52 --> 02:15:01.52
I know there's any Olympic sport that I would be that I have the genetic makeup to be able to compete at the Olympic level. I'm of course we could go back and maybe that's possible from a child.

2538
02:15:01.52 --> 02:15:13.52
I don't feel like it, but even right now, if you take that to the extreme, that means hey, you know what if I have the focus and if I have the discipline, I can become an Olympic wrestler now.

2539
02:15:13.52 --> 02:15:31.52
The Olympic high jumper, right? How's that vert looking? So you see what I'm saying? Now my opinion is that is not true. And some people are not going to achieve certain things that they may want to achieve no matter how hard they want to do it.

2540
02:15:31.52 --> 02:15:49.52
Most people like, yeah, that's realistic. Some people like, no, you can believe if you believe it, you can achieve it. If I could believe it, because I believed it, I'd be like, I'd be just all winning everything.

2541
02:15:49.52 --> 02:16:01.52
It's not that easy. You got to believe it. You got to work hard at it. You got to have some natural capabilities. So it is. I'm sorry to let everyone down.

2542
02:16:01.52 --> 02:16:27.52
Sarahars the led fighters back to the top of the world. It's nice and looks like you're doing nice mistakes.

2543
02:16:27.52 --> 02:16:29.52
around, oh yeah, I believe I can do this.

2544
02:16:29.52 --> 02:16:31.32
So I'm going to achieve, no, no, no.

2545
02:16:31.32 --> 02:16:33.12
You want to achieve, you got to do something.

2546
02:16:33.12 --> 02:16:36.72
And the same token that is also correct is that if you don't believe in what you're doing,

2547
02:16:36.72 --> 02:16:38.72
then yeah, there's no way you're going to achieve it.

2548
02:16:38.72 --> 02:16:43.12
You won't be able to gut through it when it gets problematic, which it's certainly going to.

2549
02:16:43.12 --> 02:16:50.32
So, sacs agrees with me that, hey, the work of nature has to be in play.

2550
02:16:50.32 --> 02:16:53.52
Otherwise, it's not happening.

2551
02:16:53.52 --> 02:16:57.92
You might get to some level, but yeah, reality is.

2552
02:16:57.92 --> 02:16:59.92
That's hard. I think that's hard when to admit.

2553
02:16:59.92 --> 02:17:01.52
You don't seem like you want to admit this.

2554
02:17:01.52 --> 02:17:05.92
I think you're over there. Like, you, if you wanted to go to distance, put it this way.

2555
02:17:05.92 --> 02:17:13.12
It seems really like that's not true. It seems like, you know, you maybe just didn't work hard enough.

2556
02:17:13.12 --> 02:17:17.28
Even though you thought that you worked as hard as you possibly had, maybe the fact it,

2557
02:17:17.28 --> 02:17:20.72
this is what it seems like. But at the end of the day, I do agree with that.

2558
02:17:20.72 --> 02:17:27.04
I mean, it's way clear with physical stuff because physical limitations are way more obvious.

2559
02:17:27.04 --> 02:17:29.52
And there's, I don't know.

2560
02:17:32.24 --> 02:17:35.20
Well, let's face it. Let's say playing guitar because I play guitar.

2561
02:17:35.20 --> 02:17:38.56
Yeah. And I also now kind of play ukulele. Yeah.

2562
02:17:39.92 --> 02:17:41.12
But let's say playing guitar.

2563
02:17:42.72 --> 02:17:47.04
Even if you practice and you can mechanically play guitar, that doesn't give you the

2564
02:17:47.04 --> 02:17:54.64
natural spark of creativity that is demanded. If it did, then every person that worked

2565
02:17:54.64 --> 02:17:58.40
hard and play guitar would become a rock and roll star with great creative songs. But it just

2566
02:17:58.40 --> 02:18:03.84
doesn't happen. Yeah. There's hundreds of thousands, just in America, there's hundreds of thousands

2567
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:11.76
of people that play guitar at an incredibly capable proficiency. Right? They can play every song

2568
02:18:11.76 --> 02:18:16.24
that you hear on the radio. But you know what they do for a living? Cover songs.

2569
02:18:16.24 --> 02:18:19.92
Well, they play cover songs. They're also working as a banker somewhere because they didn't have

2570
02:18:19.92 --> 02:18:25.04
whatever creative thing that would give them to be able to create something that was new and that

2571
02:18:25.04 --> 02:18:30.24
people wanted to want to listen to. That needs to come from somewhere else. Yeah.

2572
02:18:30.24 --> 02:18:34.32
In practice isn't going to get you there. Some people learn it in the schools. Some people learn

2573
02:18:34.32 --> 02:18:38.16
it on the streets. But I think you kind of got to be born with it. Man, that's a little

2574
02:18:38.16 --> 02:18:49.12
tumacious deep for everyone. Yeah. And again, can you teach creativity? And even then, it's like,

2575
02:18:49.12 --> 02:18:55.04
yeah, but no. Yeah. Really. Exactly. I mean, compare the guys. And then where do you get it? Really,

2576
02:18:55.04 --> 02:19:00.000
you know, it's a, yeah. It's weird. It's just, I think that's really the reason that it is true

2577
02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.56
is because you can't put your finger on it. You can't be like, yeah, just work as hard as you

2578
02:19:04.56 --> 02:19:10.64
possibly can. Sure. That's going to be well, improve. Another classic example is look at the people,

2579
02:19:10.64 --> 02:19:18.16
you know, if I go to an academic high level academic environment where everyone is, you know,

2580
02:19:18.16 --> 02:19:24.72
incredibly intelligent, but not all of them are able to do something that not all of them are able

2581
02:19:24.72 --> 02:19:37.44
to succeed at the level that their heritage would point towards. So just because you got a 1600

2582
02:19:37.44 --> 02:19:42.40
on your SATs and you did this and you went to this great college, there's a lot of people that did

2583
02:19:42.40 --> 02:19:48.40
all those things and they're, they're not what they themselves would consider successful, right?

2584
02:19:49.12 --> 02:19:54.56
And so the reality is there's something not there. And like you said, I don't know that you can

2585
02:19:54.56 --> 02:20:01.20
actually put your finger on it. Yeah. Because there's some other kid that didn't do any of that

2586
02:20:01.20 --> 02:20:06.48
and made stuff happen. Yeah. And was extremely successful. There's thousands and thousands of

2587
02:20:06.48 --> 02:20:11.52
examples like that, too. Yeah. So it's kind of like when you compare it like the proverbial

2588
02:20:11.52 --> 02:20:17.68
person with all the potential versus someone with not that much potential. And maybe the guy with

2589
02:20:17.68 --> 02:20:22.72
it with lead less potential, there'll be exceptions where that guy made it. And then they'll be,

2590
02:20:22.72 --> 02:20:27.84
obviously like all these other scenarios where the guy with the potential doesn't. Doesn't make sure.

2591
02:20:27.84 --> 02:20:31.44
Yeah. So it's like, all right, you know, this guy's born with it. What would we kind of

2592
02:20:31.44 --> 02:20:36.96
let's take it to a new level, not just making it, but actually being a, like the highest level.

2593
02:20:36.96 --> 02:20:41.68
Yeah. For that person, you got to have the talent and you got to have the work. Yeah.

2594
02:20:41.68 --> 02:20:51.68
Gotta do both. Hence to be this case. Check. And he says the same thing here. I've seen very good

2595
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:57.52
kernels become very bad generals. I have known others who were great takers of villages, excellent

2596
02:20:57.52 --> 02:21:04.80
from maneuvers within an army, but who outside of that were not even able to lead a thousand men in

2597
02:21:04.80 --> 02:21:13.52
war, who lost their heads completely and were unable to make a decision. Any decision. So he sees the

2598
02:21:13.52 --> 02:21:21.84
same thing. And you, you know, I see that with business leaders. The business leader that you need to be

2599
02:21:21.84 --> 02:21:25.92
at the beginning of your business is not the same business leader that you need to be once your

2600
02:21:25.92 --> 02:21:30.40
business is more successful. You got to have this, some guys are good at street fighting. Right?

2601
02:21:30.40 --> 02:21:36.88
They're good at street fighting. They're not good at planning a war, planning a campaign. And so

2602
02:21:36.88 --> 02:21:41.84
you might win as a company. If you're a leader at the street fighting level and you do good,

2603
02:21:41.84 --> 02:21:48.80
you scrap it out. Then as you grow, if you don't transition mentally and become a different kind of

2604
02:21:48.80 --> 02:21:53.20
leader, not a different person, but a different kind of leader, you may not be able to win at the

2605
02:21:53.20 --> 02:22:01.52
higher levels. So that needs to get paid attention to back to the book. One should once and for all

2606
02:22:01.52 --> 02:22:07.92
a established standard combat procedures, which the troops as well as the general who leads them.

2607
02:22:07.92 --> 02:22:14.000
No, I'm not the first person to talk about standard operating procedures.

2608
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.08
Uh-oh. These are general rules such as preserving proper distances on the march,

2609
02:22:20.08 --> 02:22:24.72
when charging to charge vigorously to fill up intervals in the first line from the second.

2610
02:22:24.72 --> 02:22:31.20
No written instructions are required for this. It is the ABC of the troops and nothing is simpler.

2611
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:37.44
Standard operating procedures. He also says that the general

2612
02:22:37.44 --> 02:22:42.96
should preserve an unfettered mind and not occupy himself with trifles.

2613
02:22:47.36 --> 02:22:54.72
I am convinced that a skillful general could make war all his life without being forced into one.

2614
02:22:56.96 --> 02:23:02.000
That's the old. The real martial artist doesn't have to fight. The art of fighting without

2615
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:14.08
fighting is... War can be made without leaving anything to chance. And this is the highest point

2616
02:23:14.08 --> 02:23:24.40
of perfection and skill as a general. So he now are there things that are left to chance in war?

2617
02:23:24.40 --> 02:23:29.12
Yeah. There's a lot of things that are left to chance in war, but can you mitigate a lot of those?

2618
02:23:29.12 --> 02:23:33.84
Yeah. Absolutely. Back to the book. The words of the proverb,

2619
02:23:34.96 --> 02:23:39.36
a bridge of gold should be made for the enemy is followed religiously.

2620
02:23:40.16 --> 02:23:43.60
Meaning I'm going to give. If the enemy wants to run, I'm going to build him a bridge,

2621
02:23:43.60 --> 02:23:47.60
gold to run on. You want to run away? That's great. War is over.

2622
02:23:48.96 --> 02:23:55.92
This is false. On the contrary, the pursuit should be pushed to the limit and the retreat

2623
02:23:55.92 --> 02:24:03.28
which had appeared such a satisfactory solution will be turned into a route. A detachment of

2624
02:24:03.28 --> 02:24:12.08
10,000 men can destroy an army of 100,000 in flight. Nothing inspires so much terror or occasions,

2625
02:24:12.08 --> 02:24:19.04
so much damage for everything is lost. So he's saying, no, you don't let the enemy get away.

2626
02:24:19.04 --> 02:24:21.60
When they're running, that's when you destroy them completely.

2627
02:24:21.60 --> 02:24:29.76
This is not to say that it is necessary to give yourself up totally to the pursuit and fall

2628
02:24:29.76 --> 02:24:35.76
the enemy with all your forces. But if the officer you have ordered in pursuit,

2629
02:24:35.76 --> 02:24:43.28
prides himself upon the regularity of his formation and the precautions of his march,

2630
02:24:43.28 --> 02:24:51.36
there is no use in having sent him. He must attack, push and pursue without cease.

2631
02:24:52.48 --> 02:24:58.40
All maneuvers are good then. It is only precautions that are worthless.

2632
02:25:02.08 --> 02:25:11.12
Yeah, and that right there kind of wraps up the highlights of this book,

2633
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:20.48
attack, push, pursue without ceaseing. And I believe that is also known as getting after it.

2634
02:25:22.96 --> 02:25:26.16
And what's interesting is I think it's clear that as we continue to see

2635
02:25:27.44 --> 02:25:33.60
these leaders throughout history that were able to lead through the harshest of conditions,

2636
02:25:34.56 --> 02:25:40.000
there's obviously a lot of common principles that they share. And so the question is,

2637
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.36
okay, why do we keep reading them then? Why do I keep trying to confirm the same things?

2638
02:25:45.36 --> 02:25:50.72
Why am I always looking actually for counterpoints as well? That offers some kind of

2639
02:25:50.72 --> 02:25:54.80
different solution like the one about Sunsuit today. You don't need to be early on the battlefield,

2640
02:25:54.80 --> 02:25:58.16
but if it's cold out there and it's going to wear down your troops, don't be early.

2641
02:26:00.56 --> 02:26:07.20
But from my perspective, the more different angles that you see these things, the more different

2642
02:26:07.20 --> 02:26:13.36
ways that you learn the same lesson, the more clearly you understand. If you learn an armlock from

2643
02:26:13.36 --> 02:26:16.80
three different people, they're all going to give you something different. And it's the same thing.

2644
02:26:16.80 --> 02:26:26.08
We get something slightly different from all these strategic thinkers. And we get better understanding

2645
02:26:26.08 --> 02:26:36.72
of it. And there are differences in what people say. And I think it's good to look at the way

2646
02:26:36.72 --> 02:26:43.20
those differences manifest themselves on the battlefield and throughout history because maybe there's

2647
02:26:43.20 --> 02:26:49.12
one solution. That's a little bit better than the one that I know right now. So for me,

2648
02:26:51.28 --> 02:26:59.12
I'm going to continually try to reinforce, try and fortify, try and stay humble as

2649
02:26:59.12 --> 02:27:06.40
Sacks talked about, continue to learn and relearn and discard what doesn't work and always

2650
02:27:06.40 --> 02:27:15.44
try and get better. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2651
02:27:18.08 --> 02:27:22.16
Yeah, I guess it better be. I thought this was going to be a quick episode.

2652
02:27:22.16 --> 02:27:28.16
Well, I'm good. No, all right. I guess we should move quickly now. What do you think?

2653
02:27:28.16 --> 02:27:33.92
You agree? No, it doesn't sound like it. I'll see you at up. So getting better.

2654
02:27:34.56 --> 02:27:40.000
Yeah, speaking and getting better. Jocquad some supplements. They're jocquad supplements.

2655
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.32
So you know, you're going to get better. And there's, okay, so super crill is the crill oil supplement.

2656
02:27:48.32 --> 02:27:54.000
Good one. Super. And join warfare. And discipline case. We'll say those three supplements.

2657
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.40
If anyone's wondering if you're watching on YouTube and you're seeing me drink two things.

2658
02:27:59.36 --> 02:28:05.12
I'm drinking two things. One of them is in a smart water bottle. And it is I'm drinking discipline.

2659
02:28:06.24 --> 02:28:11.52
The other is in a Poland spring bottle that I brought back from Maine to a Miami of Maine.

2660
02:28:11.52 --> 02:28:15.52
And I'm drinking that one. Jocquad. So those bottles are in your tube.

2661
02:28:16.32 --> 02:28:21.04
Yeah, well, they're in a northeast. We'll say. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, but you won't get, you won't find

2662
02:28:21.04 --> 02:28:24.80
Poland spring out here. No, no, that's from Maine. You brought it back. Just don't.

2663
02:28:25.76 --> 02:28:31.68
Nonetheless, so super crill, crill oil. That is in fish oil. Factually.

2664
02:28:32.40 --> 02:28:38.32
Factually. And then this jocco super crill, which is better than regular crill oil. Factually.

2665
02:28:38.32 --> 02:28:44.80
No, there's, there's, there's people out there not taking crill oil. And I'm not saying they should

2666
02:28:44.80 --> 02:28:51.76
take real oil. They should take crill oil. I just just not what I'm saying right now. I am saying if I will

2667
02:28:51.76 --> 02:28:58.96
argue, I'll actually pretty much guarantee pretty much. I know that defeats the purpose of

2668
02:28:58.96 --> 02:29:04.80
a guarantee. But I'll pretty much guarantee that if someone's not taking crill oil, whether you

2669
02:29:04.80 --> 02:29:09.36
jocquad crill oil or not, and they take crill oil, they'll be like dang. I should have started

2670
02:29:09.36 --> 02:29:13.60
taking this crill oil before. Is it like learning to do when you start to just you got man, I should have

2671
02:29:13.60 --> 02:29:18.32
missed. I wish I started this when I was 13. It's just like that on a smaller level. I know,

2672
02:29:18.32 --> 02:29:27.68
unadjoint maintenance level. Yeah. And joint warfare is what I'm feeling is for me, that's kind of,

2673
02:29:27.68 --> 02:29:33.20
it's new, right? And I'm like man, I wish I could not this far along. Wait, the joint warfare? Yeah.

2674
02:29:33.20 --> 02:29:37.92
Yeah. Because you can feel it's like you're getting maintenance. Well, you should have

2675
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:42.56
came up with it earlier. No, no, no. Next time, that's what you're going to do. Come out with it earlier.

2676
02:29:42.56 --> 02:29:46.08
That's what I think you should do. Then the less they're for you joined. It's good. And we're all working out.

2677
02:29:46.08 --> 02:29:53.36
Hey, we're making something. We're making a new product. We'll share. And it is,

2678
02:29:55.20 --> 02:30:02.64
it's going to be good. You're going to like it. It's a it's a protein drink. And it's going to be

2679
02:30:02.64 --> 02:30:09.12
all. I've had, we've done two sampling given the ingredients. So we give the ingredients to the

2680
02:30:09.12 --> 02:30:18.000
supplement factory. They mix them. And we've gone through two, we've gone through two iterations.

2681
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:24.16
Mm-hmm. Right. The first iteration, I was like, oh my god, this tastes good.

2682
02:30:24.88 --> 02:30:29.44
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Well, talking pure taste. Yeah. You're just, the first one, I was like,

2683
02:30:29.44 --> 02:30:36.40
oh, this is this taste good. Really good. Like the kind where you think this is a whole new thing.

2684
02:30:36.40 --> 02:30:39.52
You know what I mean? Wait, I'll hold a new thing like this is like, I can't put it in this

2685
02:30:39.52 --> 02:30:45.68
thing. Yeah, because protein, taste, protein powders. Yeah, it has a graph. Yeah. And that was one of the

2686
02:30:45.68 --> 02:30:53.12
things. We researched to figure out how we could make it taste legit. Good. Where you, you're, hold

2687
02:30:53.12 --> 02:30:58.32
your nose. And forcing down the band. Yeah. The first sample that we got, which I was in Maine when

2688
02:30:58.32 --> 02:31:05.52
we tasted it, we stood there as me, Brian and Pete. And we were standing that. And we, we all mixed it

2689
02:31:05.52 --> 02:31:10.08
up together and imported it into three separate cups. Sure. And everyone when we drank it,

2690
02:31:10.08 --> 02:31:15.44
everyone's like quiet for a second. It was like, oh my god. What kind of is it? It was, well, this one was

2691
02:31:15.44 --> 02:31:22.88
mint chocolate. Yeah. And it's just really good. And obviously the protein and it's awesome.

2692
02:31:23.68 --> 02:31:30.56
And we've got some other things in it that are going to make it more complete. But yeah. And then I just

2693
02:31:30.56 --> 02:31:34.48
got the sec. But you know, there's a couple of gistements that I wanted to make to the taste, just the

2694
02:31:34.48 --> 02:31:40.48
pure taste. Yeah. So we just made those adjustments. I got the second iteration in. It tastes even

2695
02:31:40.48 --> 02:31:44.48
better than the first one. But I still, I've sent them back for one more. I hopefully it only

2696
02:31:44.48 --> 02:31:48.16
be one more iteration before we can start producing it. It's going to not come out for a while.

2697
02:31:48.16 --> 02:31:52.32
It takes a long time to get everything rolling. But yeah. Anyways, we have that in the future.

2698
02:31:52.32 --> 02:31:56.64
That's interesting. Yeah. Because I don't, I'm not into protein. I know you are. I was back. You

2699
02:31:56.64 --> 02:32:03.52
really. There is this one. I'm telling you, you will be. I won't be for protein. It'll be for like a

2700
02:32:03.52 --> 02:32:07.04
dessert. It'll be like someone saying they're not into this. It's going to be like someone saying,

2701
02:32:07.04 --> 02:32:13.76
I'm not into ice cream. That's how it tastes. It is. All right. Well, good. I guess we'll see. I guess that's

2702
02:32:13.76 --> 02:32:18.24
kind of the test right in a way. In a way. In a way. In a way. It's a test. Well, good. Now the last

2703
02:32:18.24 --> 02:32:25.20
cruel oil joint warfare and discipline. Those are already out. Yeah. Doing work. Discipline taste good, too.

2704
02:32:25.20 --> 02:32:29.12
Yeah. That's another thing. You don't have to drink something that tastes like crap, just because

2705
02:32:29.12 --> 02:32:34.56
it's awesome for you. You can drink something that tastes good. And I'll tell you one thing I'm

2706
02:32:34.56 --> 02:32:39.52
noticed and I don't know if this is, I don't know what this means. But when I drink discipline,

2707
02:32:40.08 --> 02:32:43.84
because I work out in the morning as I say all the time, I don't do a pre-workout thing. It's not

2708
02:32:43.84 --> 02:32:49.84
my thing. Right? I work out in the morning on an empty stomach. Yeah. And there's this old rock

2709
02:32:49.84 --> 02:32:55.36
climber. And I can't think of his name right now. One of the famous old rock climbers. And he would

2710
02:32:55.36 --> 02:33:01.04
I read an article one time about him where he was he would climb while starving himself and wearing

2711
02:33:01.04 --> 02:33:04.88
a weight belt. It was harder. I'll say yes. I'm going to do that. I've done that all the time.

2712
02:33:04.88 --> 02:33:15.28
Done the numbers. It's anyways. If you have some discipline, the drink. Then you will feel

2713
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:19.36
like, so when I get done working out, maybe like, let's say, you know, I always say, I usually have

2714
02:33:19.36 --> 02:33:26.96
some nuts around. It's going to mix nuts just to kind of get in my gut, little food. I've been

2715
02:33:26.96 --> 02:33:31.44
having some, you know, a couple handfuls of mix nuts and then having some discipline and I feel

2716
02:33:31.44 --> 02:33:37.20
so like super good that then I'm just firing through the day. And so basically what I'm getting

2717
02:33:37.20 --> 02:33:46.16
out of this is I've been eating even cleaner because I'm eating like, I'm eating basically right

2718
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:50.80
now I think I'm eating once a day. I'm eating discipline. I'm at drink it's discipline and then I'm

2719
02:33:50.80 --> 02:33:58.24
going once a day with a good solid meal and then yeah, it's man's good. It's good stuff and that's

2720
02:33:58.24 --> 02:34:03.44
good. That works. It's working good for me because I'll tell you why when I eat less, I feel better.

2721
02:34:03.44 --> 02:34:09.28
Yeah, that's when I eat less, I feel better. And so this is making me eat less. Now, I'm not saying

2722
02:34:09.28 --> 02:34:14.80
now believe me when I eat, dude, I get it on. That's how I roll. When I eat, I get it on. And

2723
02:34:14.80 --> 02:34:21.76
but this is just yeah, it's nice to be able to get to feel energized and sharp mentally without

2724
02:34:21.76 --> 02:34:29.12
getting crazy. I think that, because you know, that idea that what you eat less and you feel better.

2725
02:34:29.12 --> 02:34:32.72
Yeah. And I found that to be the case and this is what I really like. I found that to be the case

2726
02:34:32.72 --> 02:34:38.000
only sometimes. I was thinking why is it like that sometimes? If I'm doing something like, you know,

2727
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.48
when we go to the mustard or something like that, I'll correct. Yeah, we're doing something all day.

2728
02:34:42.48 --> 02:34:47.36
You don't eat. And I wasn't eating. Yeah. It's kind of like, yes. But if you eat, it's kind of like,

2729
02:34:47.36 --> 02:34:52.64
your body goes into this like kind of rest most, you know. For sure. But if you eat a little bit or like,

2730
02:34:52.64 --> 02:34:57.04
just, you know, just like, I'm going to stand now all this time. E. O. K. We cruising now. Yeah.

2731
02:34:57.04 --> 02:35:01.44
Yeah, when you rest when you bounce, you're basically telling yourself, you're going into

2732
02:35:01.44 --> 02:35:07.28
a level seven echo cruise. Yeah, I'm technically recover mode. It's really kind of what it does.

2733
02:35:07.28 --> 02:35:11.20
And that's really what it felt like. So yeah, I found that that yeah, if you, so you probably

2734
02:35:11.20 --> 02:35:17.52
have a bunch of stuff to do. Oh, all the time. Yeah. Yeah. But when I'm for sure, when you're like,

2735
02:35:17.52 --> 02:35:22.32
when I'm doing a fast, I want to be doing something. Yeah. Because you sit around and think about food.

2736
02:35:22.32 --> 02:35:26.56
Yeah. Brother, that's horrible. You say like, like, when Charlie Plum was talking about being

2737
02:35:26.56 --> 02:35:30.32
in the honeyway, helping them, he's just thinking of, they were just literally sitting around thinking

2738
02:35:30.32 --> 02:35:36.88
about food all the time. Yeah. Because it wasn't even anything to do. Yeah. And food is actually a

2739
02:35:36.88 --> 02:35:41.44
little bit of a cure or relief from boredom. Yeah. You know how you get to the first year.

2740
02:35:41.44 --> 02:35:44.40
If you're back, if they were your kid, you're just bored. You look in the streets for, I don't know.

2741
02:35:44.40 --> 02:35:47.92
You're not hungry. You're bored. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2742
02:35:48.24 --> 02:35:52.000
It's funny because right now I got my, you know, my it's wrestling season. So the, the weight cuts are

2743
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.04
on. And they're not neither one of my kids that are resting are, are cutting a bunch of weight. But

2744
02:35:57.68 --> 02:36:01.68
it means that you don't, it means that there's times when you don't eat for a day, right?

2745
02:36:01.68 --> 02:36:07.12
Same thing. So you get to see the effects of that. And my daughter's like, I feel, she's like,

2746
02:36:07.12 --> 02:36:12.40
yeah, I feel fine. She's just to get angry or nothing. Yeah. She doesn't get angry. I warned my wife.

2747
02:36:13.68 --> 02:36:16.64
I said, hey, you need to watch an out because of people because you mean you don't are cutting

2748
02:36:16.64 --> 02:36:20.72
weight with fighters. They're cutting much more severe weight. And they start getting in bad moods.

2749
02:36:20.72 --> 02:36:24.48
Oh, fighters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They start getting in bad moods because they can't eat. They get

2750
02:36:24.48 --> 02:36:28.88
angry. Yeah. But neither one of my kids are cutting that much weight. They're just kind of maintaining

2751
02:36:28.88 --> 02:36:33.28
through the season. Did what I don't know if we talked about angry like that's a for real thing

2752
02:36:33.28 --> 02:36:38.72
because this is what it is. When you, when you, I mean by that physiologically, so that your frontal

2753
02:36:38.72 --> 02:36:42.80
cortex or prefrontal frontal, I don't know, whatever the front of your brain, the part that's

2754
02:36:42.80 --> 02:36:50.000
under your side to your face. That makes decisions and empathy in like all these things get compromised

2755
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.56
one year. Wait, when you're what? Hungry. I'll come on, man. Listen to me.

2756
02:36:54.56 --> 02:37:01.28
Well, I'll tell you why because it because I believe that if you if you if you made all those things

2757
02:37:01.84 --> 02:37:06.64
less effective, then we wouldn't be here as a species because every time we got hungry in the past,

2758
02:37:06.64 --> 02:37:10.24
we would have gotten all confused and frustrated and we wouldn't have been able to hunt. But the

2759
02:37:10.24 --> 02:37:16.32
bottom line is the opposite. I think is true. Back in the dirty. If you needed to hunt something

2760
02:37:16.32 --> 02:37:20.48
down, you had to be sharp. So when you didn't need it, made you sharper and more tuned. That's how

2761
02:37:20.48 --> 02:37:25.68
I feel. Okay. That's not what you know what I read and heard. But hey, I'm not saying weird that you

2762
02:37:25.68 --> 02:37:30.40
can go on the internet and find an art to the scientific articles that say the exact opposite.

2763
02:37:30.40 --> 02:37:37.28
Just follow me. So hangry from what I read. Science director. Correct. Beca,

2764
02:37:37.28 --> 02:37:45.20
well, the dating is word hangry. But empathy and this is with like if you get hungry or sleep deprived

2765
02:37:45.20 --> 02:37:50.56
uh whatever. Yeah, just the part of your brain kind of. It doesn't shut down completely. It just

2766
02:37:50.96 --> 02:37:58.08
because yesterday yesterday, yesterday I went to sleep. I went to bed. Sure. At 830 at night.

2767
02:37:58.08 --> 02:38:03.68
Hey. That's the thing. Yeah. I woke a bit like 350 and I was kind of, I was like, yeah,

2768
02:38:03.68 --> 02:38:08.16
that felt good. Yeah. I was, but I didn't sleep almost at all the night before. So I was

2769
02:38:08.16 --> 02:38:12.72
recovering. I needed to put some more back in the back and everyone says you can't do that. Yeah.

2770
02:38:12.72 --> 02:38:16.88
I mean, you can't catch up on sleep. I just did. Yeah. I don't know. I just did. I feel like you

2771
02:38:16.88 --> 02:38:22.48
were in. Yeah. I caught up on sleep. I never let you finish your scientific explanation. So what was

2772
02:38:22.48 --> 02:38:29.76
the deal? It just was less hard to answer. So you'll treat people worse. Oh, technically.

2773
02:38:31.20 --> 02:38:36.16
So yeah, hangry. That's apparently from what I read is it's a little thing. Maybe not. So maybe

2774
02:38:36.16 --> 02:38:39.04
I'm sure. I'm sure. Gresson. Yeah. Maybe you're up your Gresson. Maybe it does make you sharpen

2775
02:38:39.04 --> 02:38:42.40
when you're sharper. You're not taking any crop from anybody. So you're more aggressive towards them.

2776
02:38:42.40 --> 02:38:45.92
Cause you want to go on hunt and kill something. Maybe I do agree with your weird science.

2777
02:38:45.92 --> 02:38:50.32
You say tomato. I say tomato. I say tomato. I don't, you know, be aggressive. But nonetheless, um,

2778
02:38:50.72 --> 02:38:56.96
yeah, it's a real thing. Apparently. Okay. No. I don't know. Not to say that everyone's going to

2779
02:38:56.96 --> 02:39:01.68
behave in a certain way. I'm just saying that's what I've been internally. Maybe maybe maybe not nonetheless

2780
02:39:02.32 --> 02:39:07.52
get disciplined. It'll cognitively enhance. So if you're prefrontal or frontal corta, I forget

2781
02:39:07.52 --> 02:39:12.64
we're just both of them. Both of them. A frontal thing in your brain is shutting down. Boom. Take that discipline.

2782
02:39:12.64 --> 02:39:17.04
The cognitive enhances is going to help it out. A lot. Don't be angry. Even if you're hungry.

2783
02:39:18.48 --> 02:39:23.12
Guess where you can get these things at originmain.com. Slotters cool stuff on there.

2784
02:39:23.12 --> 02:39:30.48
Originmain also has geese. Rashcards, various clothing items. All made in America. That's a good spot.

2785
02:39:30.48 --> 02:39:34.64
Just check it out. Look on there. Slotters cool stuff on there. If you want something, get something.

2786
02:39:34.64 --> 02:39:44.24
Also, if you're into workout equipment to populate your home gym, it's good. I mean,

2787
02:39:44.24 --> 02:39:50.64
home gym, by the way. One of my friends is coming into town. And he's like, yeah, let's catch a

2788
02:39:50.64 --> 02:39:56.000
workout. I'm like, we don't have to go to a gym and catch a workout at home to do something else.

2789
02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.44
Nonetheless, it made me think of how good it is to have a home gym. Nonetheless, if you have your home

2790
02:40:01.44 --> 02:40:06.08
gym going to populate it even a little bit, get your workout stuff from on it. That's what I think.

2791
02:40:06.08 --> 02:40:13.52
It's the cool one. You can do various interesting workout routines with the equipment unlike

2792
02:40:13.52 --> 02:40:19.52
Jockel. Jockel's workouts are super boring. Even though you do have kettlebells which I respect.

2793
02:40:19.52 --> 02:40:24.88
Yeah. Anything you want to add on that? No, man, that's it. Are you sure if that's the workout

2794
02:40:24.88 --> 02:40:28.32
thing? We're about to get it. No, no, no, no, that kettlebell you're good, but you're good. You're solid.

2795
02:40:28.32 --> 02:40:32.88
And I'm sure you're getting very strong. And I'm sure, you know, in case everyone doesn't know,

2796
02:40:32.88 --> 02:40:38.72
they're running his mouth. And I use that term like with, I'm not just throwing it out there.

2797
02:40:39.36 --> 02:40:44.08
I really was running my mouth and you're really pissed on that you have a what, how much is your

2798
02:40:44.08 --> 02:40:53.36
heaviest kettlebell? 90 90 pounds. Big foot and my heaviest kettlebell was 88 pounds. This is no

2799
02:40:53.36 --> 02:41:03.20
longer a problem. Now my heaviest kettlebells plural because I have two is 48 kilograms or

2800
02:41:03.20 --> 02:41:11.76
106 pounds commonly referred to as the beast. So, nonetheless, mine are from on it. They're the cool ones.

2801
02:41:11.76 --> 02:41:17.36
And you can get other cool exercise stuff there. So go on it.com slash jockel. Check out the stuff

2802
02:41:17.36 --> 02:41:26.96
there. If you want something, get something. Also, when you get your copy of reveries on the art of war,

2803
02:41:28.16 --> 02:41:34.96
by Maurice Disax. It's a good one. I like those manual kind ones. You know, one that goes, yep,

2804
02:41:34.96 --> 02:41:42.08
I know, if you think about it, there's really three types of podcasts that are happening. One is

2805
02:41:42.08 --> 02:41:54.40
Q&A. Two is manual strategies about war. Three is human nature inside war. So those are kind of,

2806
02:41:54.96 --> 02:41:58.000
when I'm reading a book, I'm like, oh, yeah, I just kind of like one of those. Yeah. Yeah.

2807
02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.52
So this would be with Napoleon's Maximus. Yeah. Something like that. The art of war by Sunsu. So we

2808
02:42:03.52 --> 02:42:10.08
don't quite a number of books like that. Yeah. And, you know, I get a little something different

2809
02:42:10.08 --> 02:42:14.16
from each of them because if you think about it, he says that you have to pay attention to the human

2810
02:42:14.16 --> 02:42:17.60
heart. Well, where are you going to learn about the human heart? He didn't say much about it. As much

2811
02:42:17.60 --> 02:42:20.48
as he said, you need to know about it. He didn't say much about it. Where are you going to find it?

2812
02:42:20.48 --> 02:42:24.16
You're going to find it by reading people that were actually in war and start to understand where

2813
02:42:24.16 --> 02:42:31.20
their heart was in this old gig. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting too because they're laid out in the

2814
02:42:31.20 --> 02:42:38.56
specific context. You know, like, like Sunsu, he's talking about, you know, a certain time period,

2815
02:42:38.56 --> 02:42:42.88
a certain place in the city of Vietnam, one and then a world where and they're still they're talking

2816
02:42:42.88 --> 02:42:47.52
about, okay, these principles at this time. Yes. This is why they were well, it was interesting

2817
02:42:47.52 --> 02:42:55.04
to do eye-drying and how more because it was his battle, two podcasts on his battle, and then

2818
02:42:55.04 --> 02:42:59.84
his book that he wrote about leadership. So you kind of got to see maybe I don't know if there's anything.

2819
02:42:59.84 --> 02:43:04.96
Now, we've seen some of that, for instance, you got Napoleon's Maximus, right? And then we

2820
02:43:04.96 --> 02:43:11.76
got to hear from a Napoleonic foot soldier. So you get to kind of see, see the war, what the war was

2821
02:43:11.76 --> 02:43:15.20
like, what the human heart was was going on with the human heart and then what was going on with

2822
02:43:15.20 --> 02:43:22.000
the minds of the stratitation. Yeah. I don't know if that's a word. Let's try it. Sure. I think so.

2823
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:28.48
Just because you know what's cool is the English language. You can words. They come about.

2824
02:43:29.04 --> 02:43:32.64
They just get formed. Yeah. That's a catch. There's a time where there was no word.

2825
02:43:32.64 --> 02:43:38.72
And then that word is there. Yeah. Well, and if you learn the OED, which is the Oxford English

2826
02:43:38.72 --> 02:43:46.96
dictionary, it tells you where the word came from and then it has like first useages. So there's

2827
02:43:46.96 --> 02:43:57.04
some words. This word was first in print in 1622 in this work of literature. Yeah. You know,

2828
02:43:57.04 --> 02:44:04.08
that's what's crazy. Two words will go in these cycles where they'll be used like like eight.

2829
02:44:04.08 --> 02:44:08.32
Right. If you say eight. That's again. That's the improper thing. It's not really a word

2830
02:44:08.32 --> 02:44:14.56
level. But aint was actually used by like high upper class people, broken the day, like long time ago.

2831
02:44:14.56 --> 02:44:20.88
And like aint and shant in all these like words. Like I shut, you know, all this and eight was one of them.

2832
02:44:20.88 --> 02:44:25.84
There's one of them. And I forget the deal, but someone in the lower class started using it.

2833
02:44:25.84 --> 02:44:30.56
And they're like, oh, they're using it now or something like that. So it went out. And it's like,

2834
02:44:30.56 --> 02:44:36.72
oh, that's not a word. But it is a word. The language in general, but definitely the English language

2835
02:44:36.72 --> 02:44:42.96
I studied English in college. And but the classes that I took, some of the classes that I took

2836
02:44:42.96 --> 02:44:48.64
were would focus on that, which was pretty interesting to me. Very interesting to me. And I think

2837
02:44:48.64 --> 02:44:56.16
the reason it's interesting to me is because language is how we communicate communication is how we

2838
02:44:56.16 --> 02:45:03.28
lead. Yeah. So if you don't know what words you're using or you can't find the right word to articulate

2839
02:45:03.28 --> 02:45:07.84
what it is you're trying to say. You know, a harder time getting your message across when you have a

2840
02:45:07.84 --> 02:45:13.92
harder time getting your message across, it's harder for you to lead it. Yeah. So and then if you kind of

2841
02:45:13.92 --> 02:45:18.56
look at the big picture of that, it's kind of like you have then then you kind of in a way should

2842
02:45:18.56 --> 02:45:22.80
know slang and stuff like that. Sure. For sure. For sure. If you're over your talking quote,

2843
02:45:22.80 --> 02:45:26.88
unquote, all proper to people who aren't used to hear from you properly, they're like,

2844
02:45:26.88 --> 02:45:30.56
what's this they're talking about or whatever? That is definitely true. And it's not just about

2845
02:45:30.56 --> 02:45:35.44
language. There. It's about culture as well. Yeah. And you know, one of the cool things that

2846
02:45:35.44 --> 02:45:40.64
when I grew up and I was kind of, you know, getting into the heart and I was in the hard

2847
02:45:40.64 --> 02:45:47.04
course in, right? It exposed me to people and things that I wouldn't have seen if I would have

2848
02:45:47.04 --> 02:45:54.16
stayed in my small New England town. So when I got to the world, meaning got out of that small

2849
02:45:54.16 --> 02:46:00.96
town and now I was in the military, I was able to understand better than I would have if I didn't.

2850
02:46:00.96 --> 02:46:08.32
Yeah. And I think that's important. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Help. For sure. Yeah. Okay. How's this word? Irrigardless.

2851
02:46:08.32 --> 02:46:14.000
Right. Irrigardless. It's not even a word. Right. That's what they said. So I had this bet.

2852
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.96
This is a long time. This is like over 10 years ago. I just bet. This is co-worker of mine. And

2853
02:46:19.84 --> 02:46:23.52
for whatever. I think my dad taught me to like, you're a girl. This is not a word. You know,

2854
02:46:25.04 --> 02:46:28.24
and he'd always like correct you. So you know how I'm in Prince in your mind. Like,

2855
02:46:28.88 --> 02:46:33.12
someone uses the word irregardless. They should be corrected. That was kind of imprinted in my

2856
02:46:33.12 --> 02:46:38.80
subconscious. So it happened at where? Yeah. Good Charles Grammar not to come out for a little bit.

2857
02:46:38.80 --> 02:46:45.04
I was for a little bit. It was more just out of fun. But nonetheless, he, no, she was a girl.

2858
02:46:45.84 --> 02:46:53.04
I said, Irrigardless is not a word. It's like, yeah, it is. I was like, no, Irrigardless is like a misuse

2859
02:46:53.04 --> 02:46:59.20
misuse of a word. Irrigardless is a misuse of a word. It's not a word. He's like, well, if it's a

2860
02:46:59.20 --> 02:47:04.80
misuse of a word, it's the word for the misuse of this specific word. And I'm like, it's not a word

2861
02:47:04.80 --> 02:47:09.84
that held that just means. Yeah, but she's saying she's saying basically, if you can say it and you

2862
02:47:09.84 --> 02:47:15.76
can spell it and it's like, if it's a little name for something, it's not the name of any of it. It's

2863
02:47:15.76 --> 02:47:22.000
a name for a misuse of a word is what that was her argument. That was the, did you win money? No, I did

2864
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.44
not win the money. No, so we're, we, it never got resolved between me and her. In fact, we hated it. I

2865
02:47:27.44 --> 02:47:31.92
think we kind of hated each other. Yeah, because it got heated. We're actually that

2866
02:47:31.92 --> 02:47:36.72
made each other. It was cool. But nonetheless, that was her stance. My stance is, you can't just

2867
02:47:36.72 --> 02:47:42.48
invent a word. You can't just use a word wrong, invent another word because you're wrong. And then

2868
02:47:42.48 --> 02:47:45.76
be like, oh, no, it's a word. Now I'm right. All of a sudden, you can't do this. Not how

2869
02:47:45.76 --> 02:47:50.72
it works. And then so I look it up in the dictionary. Yeah, I was haunting me. So when I went on

2870
02:47:50.72 --> 02:47:56.24
or looked it up in the dictionary, sure enough, the thing was there. And it said the misuse

2871
02:47:56.24 --> 02:48:01.84
of the, or the common misuse of the regardless, some, but I'm still confused. Like, is that a word?

2872
02:48:01.84 --> 02:48:06.72
And here's the thing. I talked to Jade about it. Yeah, I bothered me a lot. So I talked to Jade about

2873
02:48:06.72 --> 02:48:10.56
it and he was like, brother, that's kind of how the language is. He's right. Getting enough people

2874
02:48:10.56 --> 02:48:14.40
misusing regardless. And then in the area, let's boom, all of a sudden, he gets shuffle right

2875
02:48:14.40 --> 02:48:18.56
into the rotation as a legitimate word. It's what? Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing?

2876
02:48:18.56 --> 02:48:24.56
It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing. It's a, it's a language is always evolving. And

2877
02:48:24.56 --> 02:48:29.28
that's what allows the language just like, just like, jiu-jitsu, just like mixed martial arts. You

2878
02:48:29.28 --> 02:48:35.44
want it to evolve. You want it to, new words to come out that can articulate something a little bit

2879
02:48:35.44 --> 02:48:40.40
better. Like, for instance, irregardless articulates that you love being risk language very well.

2880
02:48:40.40 --> 02:48:47.04
Well, yeah, but, but yeah, at some point, a hundred years in the future, irregardless

2881
02:48:47.04 --> 02:48:52.48
will become a word that has a little bit of a different meaning than regardless. Like, it's maybe

2882
02:48:52.48 --> 02:48:59.92
it's more regardless. Like irregardless of what you're saying. And it will say first used in,

2883
02:48:59.92 --> 02:49:05.04
you know, somebody's going to write an article in online or, and it's going to, the guy's going to

2884
02:49:05.04 --> 02:49:08.40
misuse it, but everyone's going to understand it. He's going to say first used here. Yeah.

2885
02:49:08.40 --> 02:49:11.44
There's all kinds of arguments you can have about language, but you have to remember that

2886
02:49:11.44 --> 02:49:15.44
it's evolving all the time. Our language is evolving all the time and it should. In France,

2887
02:49:15.44 --> 02:49:19.44
they try not to let their language evolve. Yeah. They'll try and keep that language.

2888
02:49:19.44 --> 02:49:24.40
Interesting. Or the same, the ultimate result is something like that would be, uh,

2889
02:49:24.40 --> 02:49:31.84
but the word, I think it's the same result if you try and not, not evolve your martial arts.

2890
02:49:31.84 --> 02:49:34.16
Yeah. Eventually, if you don't evolve your martial arts, you're going to lose.

2891
02:49:34.16 --> 02:49:37.84
Yeah. Yeah. That's the same thing with language. Yeah, you become less effective,

2892
02:49:38.56 --> 02:49:43.76
communication wise. Yeah. In language, as far as that goes, the word literally. Now, okay,

2893
02:49:43.76 --> 02:49:48.48
literally. We know it, here's the hard part about accepting this because literally means something

2894
02:49:48.48 --> 02:49:53.92
very specific. There's no ambiguousness. If you started to be ambiguous, you wouldn't say literally.

2895
02:49:53.92 --> 02:49:58.48
Yeah. Say figuratively or you just won't say anything. That's what you, that's the defining

2896
02:49:58.48 --> 02:50:05.12
characteristic of the word literally. But here's the thing. Now, literally doesn't mean literally.

2897
02:50:05.12 --> 02:50:10.64
Literally means just almost a lot. Yeah. Just really strong. Not even almost

2898
02:50:10.64 --> 02:50:17.04
lyrics. Just really strong. So if I was like, man, this guy's joke was so funny. I was literally

2899
02:50:17.04 --> 02:50:22.32
dying. All right. I wasn't almost dying. It's not what it means. It just means it was super duper duper

2900
02:50:22.32 --> 02:50:29.52
funny. You know? That's the one changing. Yeah, man. But that's a hard one to accept. Like and all.

2901
02:50:29.52 --> 02:50:34.48
I think there's another word, but in America and California, this is a recent one. So

2902
02:50:35.52 --> 02:50:43.76
maybe the 80s, everyone's in order to say said, said like, more all, echo was like, you got to stop

2903
02:50:43.76 --> 02:50:48.16
doing this and I was all the way. I'm going to do that. That's just the way language evolves. Yeah.

2904
02:50:48.16 --> 02:50:57.28
Dang. That's cool. I mean, I dig it. So nonetheless, if you want to buy this book,

2905
02:50:57.28 --> 02:51:03.92
regardless, regardless of the language, you didn't do that. What I did was I made it easy.

2906
02:51:03.92 --> 02:51:10.32
You go to jocopakas.com on the top menu, whatever, you put a page there. Has all the books

2907
02:51:10.32 --> 02:51:14.80
buy up a so this one is on there along with everything else. Just click through there. It's a good

2908
02:51:14.80 --> 02:51:20.64
way to support and you get, you take the Amazon, you get your book and eight hours, however long it takes

2909
02:51:20.64 --> 02:51:25.68
to ship to your house. Good way to support. Also, if you're doing other shopping, if you're going to buy

2910
02:51:25.68 --> 02:51:31.44
that lawnmower and leaf blower that you've been meaning to buy and the rake as well.

2911
02:51:32.16 --> 02:51:36.80
Follow. Just saying. You're in the wrong time zone every wrong time of year for that. Oh yeah.

2912
02:51:36.80 --> 02:51:40.96
Wait, the rake. No, it's about to be springs. So what? You got another six months before you

2913
02:51:40.96 --> 02:51:46.96
get the rake out in the lawnbower. Yeah. I just, that's one of the last things I bought with a leaf

2914
02:51:46.96 --> 02:51:54.32
blower. Really. Yeah. Okay. Long story. Nonetheless, duct tape. That's your round tape. So if you

2915
02:51:54.32 --> 02:51:58.64
can eat it, duct tape, just carry on shopping, whatever you want to do. That's what you do. Good

2916
02:51:58.64 --> 02:52:03.68
way to support. Also, subscribe to the podcast. I do in the stitch or google play. Spotify.

2917
02:52:03.68 --> 02:52:09.84
Why? Or wherever else they have podcasts and wherever else you want to listen to the podcast. They have

2918
02:52:09.84 --> 02:52:15.60
like new podcasts apps out too. Yeah. They all have them though. Yeah. And I did it. So hey,

2919
02:52:15.60 --> 02:52:22.32
whatever you're using to listen, subscribe. It seems obvious, I guess, on the listening part.

2920
02:52:22.32 --> 02:52:26.40
But YouTube not so much. We have a YouTube channel. Subscribe to that too. That's a good way to support.

2921
02:52:26.40 --> 02:52:31.28
If you want, because some people not into YouTube. Who's not into YouTube? I don't know.

2922
02:52:31.28 --> 02:52:36.000
YouTube has good information on it. You can also waste a bunch of time on it. Yeah. Yeah. It's like just,

2923
02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:40.72
yeah, it's like the internet in general. You know, a lot of things. You're whole,

2924
02:52:42.08 --> 02:52:47.28
like pursuit can be on the internet and it can be very beneficial. And at the same time, your whole

2925
02:52:47.28 --> 02:52:52.40
pursuit can be in the internet or you do. And it can be detrimental. What do you mean you're pursuit?

2926
02:52:52.40 --> 02:52:57.44
Like, whatever you're trying to do, going on the internet will basically make it out. So like if you're

2927
02:52:57.44 --> 02:53:02.96
trying to, if you're trying to learn 3D modeling, going the internet, you can learn 3D modeling,

2928
02:53:02.96 --> 02:53:08.96
100% or not 100%. But you can learn to be a professional 3D modeler on the internet.

2929
02:53:09.68 --> 02:53:14.88
At the same time, you get caught up watching some nonsense and not even take one step towards 3D modeling.

2930
02:53:14.88 --> 02:53:19.52
I want to say it's that they caught me at the internet. YouTube has the same dichotomy. But if you

2931
02:53:19.52 --> 02:53:25.44
subscribe to the Jockel podcast YouTube channel, there's no dichotomy there. All good. All good.

2932
02:53:25.44 --> 02:53:30.72
100% upside because it has video version of the podcast. It has excerpts and it has various other

2933
02:53:30.72 --> 02:53:36.16
little videos. We'll just sort of add. I always say I'm going to add, but this time I think I'm

2934
02:53:36.16 --> 02:53:42.16
really going to add a different type of video. You'll see. Anyway, good way to support. Also,

2935
02:53:42.16 --> 02:53:47.28
Jockel is a store. If you didn't already know, it's called Jockel Store. Jockel Store. Come,

2936
02:53:47.28 --> 02:53:52.40
that's where you can get the shirt that Jockel is wearing right now. Victory MMA in fitness.

2937
02:53:52.40 --> 02:53:57.52
You have to be a member of a victory MMA in fitness. If you have the shirt, you're kind of a member.

2938
02:53:57.52 --> 02:54:03.60
Yeah, at least in spirit. You're a member in a, yeah, in that sort of way. Nonetheless,

2939
02:54:03.60 --> 02:54:10.48
it's on Jockel Store. Come. It's where you can get any of the shirts that we make and sell. We also have

2940
02:54:10.48 --> 02:54:18.48
hoodies on there and rash cards and hats and patches. A lot of good stuff. Kids, women's good stuff.

2941
02:54:18.48 --> 02:54:23.68
I'm not saying to go buy something. I'm not saying that. I'm saying go there. Jockel Store. Come.

2942
02:54:23.68 --> 02:54:28.80
Check out this stuff. You want something? Get something. And that's a good way to support. Also,

2943
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:34.80
psychological warfare. If you don't know what that is, which I know you do. But in the

2944
02:54:35.52 --> 02:54:40.24
unlikely event of you not knowing what that is, this is what it is. It's an album.

2945
02:54:41.04 --> 02:54:47.28
Not a music album. It's a spoken word album with tracks. Jockel, helping us through

2946
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:56.16
weak points of our day, weak points of our campaign against weakness, weak points of our struggle,

2947
02:54:56.16 --> 02:55:00.80
struggle, good struggles. Struggle for good, sure. Struggle for good. That's what it is.

2948
02:55:01.36 --> 02:55:04.80
You know, the day you want to, you want to sleep in or you want to chew it on the day. You want to

2949
02:55:04.80 --> 02:55:08.56
procrastinate. You want to skip the workout. That's the main one. That's iconic one.

2950
02:55:08.56 --> 02:55:13.84
Just keeping the workout. Because you get workouts. All the rest of us are over getting leg day.

2951
02:55:13.84 --> 02:55:20.56
I'm sorry, but I did legs the other day. A good one. Didn't skip it. Psychological warfare. That's

2952
02:55:20.56 --> 02:55:26.40
on iTunes. It helps you through it. Yeah. Some people don't know. So it's Jockel on each track.

2953
02:55:26.40 --> 02:55:30.32
I'm telling you sometimes that they're like, wait, what did I didn't hear it of this?

2954
02:55:30.32 --> 02:55:32.96
Psychological warfare. Now they're not going to listen to the rest of this podcast.

2955
02:55:32.96 --> 02:55:38.24
Brother, they will. It only has like two minutes three, four, like 25 minutes left. I'm just saying.

2956
02:55:38.24 --> 02:55:43.12
Psychological warfare is good. It's almost done. If you want Jockel to help you, just put it in.

2957
02:55:43.12 --> 02:55:49.28
That's what originated. Jockel. Me. Not skip workout. You can get an iTunes. You can get on Amazon

2958
02:55:49.28 --> 02:55:58.48
music. You can get on Google Play and other podcasting. Other MP3 platforms. Providing platforms.

2959
02:56:00.64 --> 02:56:06.000
Also, if you're on Amazon, you can get something called Jockel White Tea. If you don't

2960
02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.56
want to have your deadlift increase to eliminate thousand pounds, then don't get Jockel White

2961
02:56:10.56 --> 02:56:16.64
Tea. You can get the books. Yeah, the books that we cover on the podcast, which are all

2962
02:56:16.64 --> 02:56:21.36
listed on the website. You can also get a couple of books that you might want to check out. One of

2963
02:56:21.36 --> 02:56:30.56
them is called Way of the War Your Kid. I actually wrote that book. It teaches kids to make their

2964
02:56:30.56 --> 02:56:38.32
lives better to get on the path. And work hard. There's another book coming out. It's actually

2965
02:56:38.32 --> 02:56:43.76
available on Amazon right now. Well, you can't get it yet, but you can pre-order it. If you want to

2966
02:56:43.76 --> 02:56:48.40
spread the word, you pre-order it. That makes more people see it. So that's cool. It's called Way of the

2967
02:56:48.40 --> 02:56:55.52
War Your Kid Marks Mission. Nice. Little follow-up to Way of the War Your Kid. Different lessons

2968
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:01.36
to be learned. So you can check that out. If you want to check out an actual War Your Kid,

2969
02:57:01.36 --> 02:57:09.76
you can go and get some Jocco soap from Young Aiden. Twelve years old, no big deal. You know what

2970
02:57:09.76 --> 02:57:17.92
he's doing? Making soap. He has his own business. You can get that at IrishOx Ranch.com. Like I said,

2971
02:57:17.92 --> 02:57:24.56
a 12 year old kid making goat milk soap. You know why? You're why did that? You can't sell goat

2972
02:57:24.56 --> 02:57:30.32
milk in California. Yeah. But you can't sell goat soap. Good milk. So yeah. Sure. So he wanted to

2973
02:57:30.32 --> 02:57:33.92
make some good ones. So you can check that out as well. The discipline equals freedom,

2974
02:57:33.92 --> 02:57:40.56
field manual. It's about getting after it. There's really nothing more to say. If you,

2975
02:57:41.60 --> 02:57:48.32
I've gotten a lot of great feedback from that book. So I appreciate it. And once you feel that,

2976
02:57:49.36 --> 02:57:56.32
you've gotten what you can out of it, loan it to somebody so they can get on the path to.

2977
02:57:56.32 --> 02:58:03.44
Maybe they'll get their own or get it form whatever to your choice. Important part of that.

2978
02:58:03.44 --> 02:58:08.16
Everyone wants the audio version of that book. The discipline equals freedom field manual.

2979
02:58:08.88 --> 02:58:18.88
Is not on audible. It's on iTunes. Amazon music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms. And it also

2980
02:58:18.88 --> 02:58:24.48
is an album that has tracks. Some people say with tracks. Extreme ownership. The new

2981
02:58:24.48 --> 02:58:28.56
edition is out. Thank you for helping us put the new new edition together because we've got

2982
02:58:28.56 --> 02:58:34.24
questions from this podcast. A new folder. We've also got pictures or a question from the podcast

2983
02:58:34.24 --> 02:58:39.84
in there. Extreme ownership, combat leadership. How to get up there and leave you to the win.

2984
02:58:39.84 --> 02:58:46.80

02:58:52.88 --> 02:58:57.44

Today, Burke, email info on Eshelon front.com or you can go through the website Eshelon front.com.

2988
02:59:03.84 --> 02:59:11.92
There's also the Master Leadership Seminar with the Eshelon front team. We're only doing

2989
02:59:11.92 --> 02:59:15.28
two this year. I'm going to try and get a bunch of questions that I get asked all the time.

2990
02:59:15.28 --> 02:59:19.12
I'm going to try and get rid of those questions right now. We're only doing two masters this year.

2991
02:59:19.12 --> 02:59:24.08
We aren't going to New York City. We aren't going to Texas. We aren't going to Florida. We aren't

2992
02:59:24.08 --> 02:59:28.88
going to your hometown. I'm sorry. We just can't. We can't go to every town in America to do a

2993
02:59:28.88 --> 02:59:36.16
master. We're only doing two of them this year. We're doing one in Washington DC. So as an East

2994
02:59:36.16 --> 02:59:42.80
Coast in the West Coast, one is in Washington DC. It's May 17th and 18th. We're doing another one

2995
02:59:42.80 --> 02:59:48.88
in San Francisco October 17th and 18th. So if you want to come to a master, you got to come to

2996
02:59:48.88 --> 02:59:55.20
one of those two. We're not going to Omaha. We're not going to Milwaukee. I want to go there,

2997
02:59:55.60 --> 03:00:01.84
but unfortunately we can't just get to all those different places. So apologize thus far,

2998
03:00:01.84 --> 03:00:08.72
there has been four masters that we've done over the past year and a half. They all sold out.

2999
03:00:09.44 --> 03:00:14.88
These two masters are going to sell out as well. So if you want to come and you want to learn

3000
03:00:14.88 --> 03:00:21.84
pragmatic leadership skills and strategies, then you can go to extremownership.com and you can

3001
03:00:21.84 --> 03:00:29.12
register. We will see you there. Echo Charles will also be there. And until you get to the

3002
03:00:29.12 --> 03:00:35.60
master, if you have questions for us, or you have answers for us, we're looking for both. We're here

3003
03:00:35.60 --> 03:00:44.96
and we are cruising hard actually on the interwebs on Twitter, Instagram, and on Duffy.

3004
03:00:44.96 --> 03:00:52.32
Boha. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and finally thanks to those people

3005
03:00:52.32 --> 03:00:58.96
out there that make this podcast possible. And by that, I mean first and foremost, our military men

3006
03:00:58.96 --> 03:01:08.72
and women who go into harm's way to protect our freedom and our way of life. Thanks to you and also

3007
03:01:08.72 --> 03:01:16.24
to the police out there holding the thin blue line. Thanks for protecting us here on the home front

3008
03:01:16.24 --> 03:01:25.68
to the firefighters, paramedics, and other first responders. Thanks for being ready to come out

3009
03:01:25.68 --> 03:01:33.28
and rescue us anytime. Day or night into everyone else, that is listening. Thank you for listening.

3010
03:01:33.28 --> 03:01:42.08
Thank you for sharing. Thank you for supporting the podcast. Because we appreciate. We appreciate

3011
03:01:42.08 --> 03:01:52.88
all that, but more important. We appreciate going down this path with all of you. So keep putting

3012
03:01:52.88 --> 03:02:00.08
one foot in front of the other as you move down this path, keep making the decisions, the right

3013
03:02:00.08 --> 03:02:13.12
decisions, even on the little things, keep attacking, pushing, pursuing without cease and most of

3014
03:02:13.12 --> 03:02:24.24
all keep getting after it. So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
