You know one thing you you mentioned a couple times was you know that the fact that we we got an average age of Well, there's that your company your prior company was 54 years old As you know, I'm also in the business of people working with their hands We've got we've got people that are manufacturing things in America that haven't been manufactured a long time here Passing on we were lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge You know Pete was lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge from some of these people that were older than 54 years old You know that were 65 we've lost some of those those mentors at origin that were passing on first hand knowledge of how to do this stuff and yeah, that's the idea I think You you mentioned that Who's going to a technical schools nowadays you know it's just I don't even know Like the high school or my kids went they they don't they are trying now to reopen the the the Auto motive you know repair section when I went to high school all the kids were working on cars It was part of you know everyone was building their own car and and doing that and then a lot of them went on to do that for a living Where's that where who's gonna do this stuff now if we don't refocus America on On the the skills that we need as a nation to be self-sufficient Could not agree more just don't need to say more could not agree more and If it's not done, Jocca there would be real ramifications to it So you got to run that game Get around those numbers in your head because if you're investing all your time into into make money So that you can buy your time back you might be losing you know Unless you figure out a way to scale it which is what you were just talking about unless you figured out a way to scale it You're gonna have a hard time doing that so that's why it's important in my opinion to be doing something that you really love doing You know, I never even ever thought I was working in While I was in the Navy probably let me rephrase up I was very seldom considering what I was doing work Just didn't seem like work ever Like just didn't seem like work so that's a really good life. I'll lie you to man, you know monetize that great build and they go live your life and do your thing and So that that notion was was was always in my mind After you know doing private equity at that point for you know 15 years a 13 years or something like that It was always in my mind and then the event at hunt kind of catapult that right into existence I formed it I was gonna put these three portfolio companies and then and you know I ran around spend and the money part of things is a real easy one to kind of gravitate to as far as your attention and like maybe a lot of time Your value system because like like obviously guys like Matt where that's they're interested in that part of things You know the fine he wanted to be an investment banker and you know that's not like a rare thing And nothing necessarily but bro. I think We could talk a lot about this, but You know the push for college of the last 20 30 years and if you look at the stats I think since 1990 College enrollments up 60% Cost adjusted for inflation is up like 300% Subsidized 100% Subsidized by the government and making loans just like just like the mortgage just like the mortgage crash They're making loans to people That Not necessarily can be able to pay those loans back because you go to college for four years and it cost $380,000 and the job that you get with your degree when you leave that school is a $32,000 or $38,000 Your job that's what that's what's happening They they take money out of the business to You know by a house or second house or boat or you know that we call those lifestyle businesses and Their nice lifestyle business, but there's no long-term viability and health for those things They though they'll die as soon as that better owner dies So what like kind of almost like they have the business just so they can make money for their lifestyle That's right. And then I think look there has to be some kind of mindset that that says oh We as a country need to unite around developing more skill trades and pushing it back down to the high school I don't know if you know, but I don't know any high schools that really have you know that kind of craft It's You get the life you give yourself Like their externalities that have happened in your life and sometimes you can't affect them you can't do anything about them But the end of the day If you decide to get up you have the discipline to get up and get after it every day and you make it a priority You can change your course of your life and all we're doing as at groundworks is using that mindset on a business that changes 4200 lies Sounds cool now, but when when you know those slim criss-misses when you know when when I'm begging my wife to To allow us to send you know eight dudes to a mustard and DC it wasn't that way The the the the the investment that you make right so this is this is the thing that's very interesting That's what does it and That attitude That attitude that work ethic that's the American culture And and look the American culture might get might get pushed around a little bit it might get it might get some layers Put on it by various things that are going on in the world, but the American culture of Hard work the culture of Entrepreneurship and the culture that Superseeds all those Is the culture of taking care of your family taking care of your friends taking care of your community taking care of your people That's the American way and that's how you win and thank you for being an example of making that happen Thank you sir and with that Mr. Matt Malone has left the building so That will turn off yes, sir Did you get a little bit of the Beyond the shark tank on that because for you I think I think I think in your mind business is kind of like shark tank Actually you're kind of right. and you know that's why I don't know if it's gonna I don't know if you know our culture is gonna match I'm very very exciting stuff, right so imagine how broker dealers clear trades literally clear trades You know equity trades are cleared but also you know Municipal bond trades how the technology works and how the processes and the regulation around clearing those trades and how these systems have to work together To do that and they had they had they had started clearing trades for a bunch of different mama pop broker dealers and some big ones and so You know think about it from a business standpoint. It's an American supply chain and then like you said We're employing Americans and we got people that are are building this country and and taking these skills You know how to conversation with someone's talking about You know people people not being fit for the military right you can sure you've seen articles like that and I know you feel strongly about bringing manufacturing back to the United States If we don't start building skill trades and a women in this country there will be a colossal collapse Think about everything we do like all these great high-tech companies and everything they do Well someone's got to run the electrical electrician lines there or the gas lines there or build those skyscrapers or whatever it might be The blue collar skill trade men and women in this country have been forgotten and You know it really came to roost for me as we started build now a shipyard staffing because the age Really scared me right What's just Look at economics was pure I want I wanted to to learn more about You know the economy and how to be effective in business and things like that, but My curiosity was really what drove Religion right so imagine going to school at a Catholic school for almost my childhood and Then of course, I'm a piscuit paying about just fascinated with the idea of of How religions are Historically rolled out and maintained and they are fed their effect on You know mankind So we took every penny that we had from those things pot of right pick and the groundworks, but still wasn't enough So in 19 You know we decided now I had outside investors I had some friends and family, you know like folks that that I've seen and and been friends with No institutional no big money guys We wanted to continue this mission and I had worked for four or five years developing relationships of companies to buy some big ones and so I Finally had to bite the bullet and and bring on a financial partner JP D'Nell Carlos Corey Cody rather and then this this young guy flanned caucran back in the day You know they would lead that process for us and and really Again, not to sound like a promotion what they became part of the team like JP knows my team and He can relate the stories of our business and the construction component of our business and a way that Ties it into extreme ownership and how it applies to our business every day and That is how you really learn and that that's how it's absorbed and so Your team's done a really good job at that for us and you might know these guys so I was a lifeguard of all things in high school Believe or not so I worked at this ocean view Life beach patrol and Good gig paid a lot more than marina didn't have to work as hard you can kind of work out and have some fun You're not be reading the lead paint Right down your throw does I look at it Now you know people always joke. and You know he Bob mentioned you need to go hide this guy so move back to Just outside of Washington DC and mind you look This is kind of surreal for me, right so went to college Flying around with an asset to buy stock exchanges That's weird Then working for the presence brother, you know Super nice guy super smart hated politics but legitimate business man and learned a ton from him what does that look like and and I just knew I wanted to have the tools to do that job I could go into business and be successful it was later That I learned kind of what specifically I wanted to be involved with in business as I met some some mentors, but At Hampton Sydney now I just knew I wanted to get some degree and and and that I felt like could best prepare me to be a successful Business and so I did my as I said I got this North of Foundation scholarship, right? oh I see the alignment between Oh decentralized command well late to see I got a bunch of disaggregated people I got small elements that are going out in the field They've got to understand how they're gonna interact with the customer that's how we're gonna get good feedback That's how we're gonna grow our business. and I was like Can't they maybe out of it because you know, you know like you know when you're hiding something on purpose
