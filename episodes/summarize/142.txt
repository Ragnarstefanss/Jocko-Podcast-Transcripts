I mean okay if you want to say that you're maneuvering so that you can maneuver so you can fire even better that's that's technically true or your maneuvering so you can break contact but you could say that here's another quote let us not think of mobility in an army general Charles P. Summer all once said unless we think of mobility accompanied by violence that's cover move that's fire maneuver that's what we're talking about combat can cannot ever approximate the conditions of field maneuvers fears of varying sort of afflict the soldier in battle the unit commander soon comes to realize that one of his difficulties is to get men to leave cover because of enemy bullets and the fear they instill in training they're being no real bullet danger even on the courses which employ live ammunition every advance under a supposed enemy fire is unrealistic two in training the soldier does not have a man as his target he is not shooting with the idea of killing there is a third vast difference in the two conditions the riflemen in training is usually under close observation and the chief pressure upon him is to give satisfaction to his superior whereas the riflemen engaging the enemy is of necessity pretty much on his own and the chief pressure on him is to remain alive if possible when the infantry men mind when the infantry men's mind is gripped by fear his body is captured by inertia which is fears semi-situin in an attack half of the men on a firing line are in terror and the other half are unnerved so wrote major general jfc fuller when he was a young captain so again this is what i kind of already talked about the idea that in training you're shooting at you're not shooting with this intent to kill and we that's what we did all the time I mean that's just how we rolled if actually they make targets were like blood comes out we shoot and balloon blows up and black you see blood so they're trying to condition you and they talk about this with video games too right that these young kids come up killing all the time in these video games which are very very realistic and therefore they get conditioned to killing and they don't think it's a big deal anymore which clearly that you could tie that into school shootings a lot of people tie that into school shootings and say hey these kids were playing these video games where there's killing people all the time and that condition them to be able to kill these innocent people in a school so there is like I said for me all I ever shot at basically was human targets things that look like people and again I've seen the video games that they are so realistic it's unbelievable and so that's another good form of conditioning to get you over the if you have any moral objection to killing now the the counter statement to that is good for people to get over the moral condition of killing some people maybe here's he's saying uh this is just good advice for this is good you follow you folks that are thinking about joining the military here we go when you prepare to fight you must prepare to talk you must learn that speech will help you save your situation you must be alert at all times to let others know what is happening to you you must use your brain and your voice anytime that any word of yours will help you or others you are a tactical unit and you must think of yourself that way don't try to win a war or capture a hill all by yourself your action alone means nothing or at best very little is when you talk to others and they join with you that your action becomes important got to communicate this is life tells the story about me telling him to use verbal commands and we've got that story over and over again because I've done it with so many different people like you need to you need to use your man voice right now like you're not being loud enough and that was a classic example of that you know life trying to communicate over the radio and people are really listening because it's put noise in your ears and all these things happen and you're you know you're here little voice and in the sealed teams like I said we're so trained to repeat those commands and I'm like life you gotta try using verbal commands bro you gotta try it the multiples of information and what's great about this is he's no longer talking about he's no longer talking about tactics of fire maneuver and this percentage of fire and all that because he's out of his element there to be quite honest with you this one he's going to get into his element which is well I'll go to it I consider to be of utmost importance the keeping informed of our man as to current situation so that each man may perform his duty with understanding of its importance and that's sergeant David T. Bolt in a letter written from the African theater so you gotta keep your people informed having started to call this chapter communications I decided against it for fear that use of that rather formidable word might interfere with my communicating to the reader what I regard as a vital but frequently overlooked principle of minor tactics if a word comes to mean too many things it frequently misses fire at the critical point that has been the fate of the word communications it has become another military catch all and because it means so many things it is quite frequently means nothing to illustrate a regimental commander asks a company commander how are your communications and the latter replies excellent because his telephone line is working and his supply is coming forward and at the same time he is at the point of despair because he hasn't had anything worthwhile any worthwhile intelligence from his flanks for hours so there's a difference between communication like I can talk to you and actual communication you're telling you what I need to know one would think that it would become almost second nature to the commander to reach eagerly toward supporting forces one would imagine that whenever on the field of battle he made contact with a friendly element that fact would flash a red light in his brain causing him automatically to raise the question have I established full communications do I know the strength and intentions of the force now helping me do they know my strength and intentions but indeed such is not the case communications information is the soul of morale and combat and the balancing force in successful tactics and now he talks a little bit about communication he gives some guidelines about him and what the problems are so information is super important here's some of the problems one there is a lacking there is lacking a general recognition of the supreme importance of the lateral flow of information two command at the lower levels is too often neglectful of the principle that it is not a channel of information only but a distribution point so you got to pass the word three commanders at the lower levels tend to be arbitrary judges of what information deriving from a source lower would be highly useful to the other elements lowered down instead of a biting by the rule went and out pass it along so went and out pass along now I do have to throw out that there can be a dichotter there's a dichotter because you can communicate things too much you can send too many emails you can send too many messages you can do that that can be a problem and he actually talks about that dichotter me a little bit so he's just talked about how much you should communicate I got to see this over when I was running training I got to see this over and over and over and over again as my fact we lay for chapter about it in the decademy leadership of situations where one situation particular where there's no voice no one's taking charge finally someone steps up and take charge and it's like boom everything changes but clear commanding voices are all too rare on the battle on the field of battle so they wait doing nothing and in action takes further toll on their resolve more grievous losses will no doubt come to this band of men in time but as a company this is the worst hour that they will ever know so it's a downward spiral if no one steps up and starts making calls you start taking casualties now if people panic even more they get more in their own little world they become more detached from each other less unity of what you're trying to make happen back to the book it would serve no purpose to dwell on the discouraging detail of this or deal if it were not for the belief that much of it is unnecessary and that the infantry soldier can find a better way one must not come to rest on class vets gloomy warning that quote in war the novice is met only by pitch black knight on beyond that there are words to be read it is of the first importance that the soldier higher low should not have to encounter in war things which seem for the first time set him in terror or perplexity so that's calls for it's talking about training you got to get people ready for this chaos and mayhem you've got to get it get them ready for it you've got to get them ready you got to show them that when people panic and people are getting separated that one commanding voice one leader stepping up and leading will have a massive impact on the situation and failure to do that will also have a massive but the impact but it will be a massive negative impact now he talks chapter five is called ratio of fire and here we get into his little hypothesis I'm not going to waste a lot of time out of it so you you need to take action you need to take initiative as long as it's benefiting the company as long as you're and you know what we talk about as commanders intent like you can do whatever you want as long as it's in support of commanders intent if it's non-support of commanders intent we get a problem in the army of the United States we act towards speech as if it were mortally as if we were mortally afraid of it we tell our men to think yet we never tell them that if in combat they remain dumb it is slow suicide slow suicide the period between wars was an age of rapid advancement in communications technique radio was born the telephone was vastly improved the teleprinter appeared in television waited just around the corner it all came so fast that we were struck dumb by our own magic how brilliant is that we were struck dumb by our magic how many people these days are are be not becoming good communicators because they're not interacting with people enough because instead of talking to them they're sending them an email that how is that affecting us pretty much everybody pretty much everybody I'm one of the people you've got emojis coming up right we got issues I don't know that might be in the step in the right direction right that additional emojis additional communication you know what it is it does add some clarity to your statements you know you credit maybe I need to get an emoji game maybe not out so do you catch that we want our people to act we want our people to act for themselves we want them to think and act and at the same time we want uniform unified unity of command we want them to be working together so we want them to act alone we want them to work together there's obviously a dichotomy there there's a complementary halves of an enlightened battle testament here we go this is beautiful but the various curious part of it is that is that training largely ignores the soul principle which makes these two basic ideas fully and finally reconcilable we do not teach our men from the day they first put on the uniform that speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat we do not say to them that for a man to be able to think straight about his tactical situation is not enough he must communicate his thoughts to others before they can begin to produce unity of action out of speech or from the written word which is it's substitute comes all unification of strength on the battle field and from the latter comes the decisive action this applies to two men serving together on an outpost it applies equally to the battalion or the regiment right there right there if you can't communicate with the other people and people don't spread the word and your team doesn't communicate well with each other you're not going to be able to join these two halves which is acting and being decisive and being using initiative and cohesiveness of your unit the question still remains what kind of initiative is beneficial and what kind is harmful and how may troops be might might be taught to distinguish between the two right But you know, you know, if somebody who, there, they're like a complete like faker, dire, and you know, they, they got an orange, you know, just some same, you know, social scenario where, you know, they have a nice car, but then they owe like 10 people, like 10s of thousands of dollars because how they screw them over in something like their friends and all this stuff, right? so what does that mean when something goes wrong when something bad happens you adapt you adjust you you alter your plans and you continue forward you own it it therefore follows that the far object of a training system is to prepare the combat officer mentally so that he can cope with the unusual and the unexpected as if it were the altogether normal and give him poise in a situation where all else is in disequilibrium say all over and over again and how do you do that how do you do that in the civilian sector right prepare your people you role-play with people you give them hard problems you make them figure things out you put them in tough situations so that they become accustomed to it but how to do it I would say that the beginning lies in a system of schooling which puts the emphasis on teaching soldiers how to think rather than what to think even though such a revolutionary idea would put the army somewhat ahead of our civilian education that's a common thing that gets said in military training is teaching people how to think not what to think and this is a good the test of fitness of command is the ability to think clearly in the face of unexpected contingency or opportunity improvisation is the essence of initiative in all combat just as initiative is the outward showing of the power of decision think about this when you're raising your kids too that's a good little something to think about you want your kids to be able to think think get that's what we got to have doing some creative stuff and i think this is important to understand overall for kind of you for sure for everyone when someone you know how like someone will text you or someone will send you like a message like a long message and some it's easy to think like hey you could have responded with like just something you know rather than nothing but here's the thing it that's not true because someone sends you a text message or especially something long and meaningful like you don't want to just reply back with okay and you can't anticipate what's happening no you can't do that dichotomy leadership you got to balance it back to the book during war it often time happens that one company by trial and error finds the true solution for some acute problem which concerns everyone but when that happens to a company I can assure you that is the exceptional company officer who takes the initiative and passes it passes his unique solution along to his superiors even after he has proved and battle that the idea works a good company idea in tactics is likely to remain confined to one company indefinitely even though it would be a benefit to the whole military establishment this is where this is just dealing with silos it happens in the military it happens in the civilian sector somebody figures something out make keep to themselves the fundamental purpose of all training today should be to develop the natural faculties and to stimulate the brain of the soldier rather than to treat him as a cog which has been fitted into a great machine got to keep point that out loyalty in the masses of men wax is strong in the degree that they are made to believe that real importance is attached to their work and to their ability to think about their work so you got to get people engaged and people got to understand and believe that what they're doing is important and they got to have some kind of say they got to have some control over their own fate it weakens at every point where they consider that there is a negative respect for their intelligence this rule applies whether a man is engaged in digging a ditch or in working up a loading table for an invasion hey maybe that person needs a little time maybe that person needs a little space but you can't give them too much time because they're going to sit there and dwell on it so pay attention the unit which fights successful action but is without knowledge of its success may even ensure a great victory for some larger body and still emerge from the battlefield with a feeling of inferiority it's a complex sentence but what are you saying is like you make sure when your people do something good you tell them because there's a lot of times where people don't people don't understand what they did and how big of an impact it had and that's bad mmm here's a good one in combat nothing succeeds like success the knowledge of victory is the beginning of a conviction of superiority just as truly the saver of one small triumph will wholly drive out the bitter taste of any number of demoralizing defeats nothing succeeds like success now we get in this section tactical cohesion important so when you start getting shot at guess what you do you get down you can't say anyone else and you don't know what's happening so your first thing that happens when you get engaged is you fall apart there after so long as it continues to engage the overriding problem of the commander is the reunification of his elements this is a great way to think about all your tactical leaders out there military police firefighters this is important think about this after the thing after the engagement starts the overriding problem of the commander is the reunification of his elements proper fire support and direction are coming are among the tools which he uses and bringing about cohesion but the fundamental means is communication getting his men to link up by talking to one another and sending a long word of what they are doing and what they have seen now this is a very simple thing it is so simple that it recalls the warning from kernel GFR Henderson in war the simple things are the most difficult past the part we say that we seek initiative in our men that is the American way of fighting we say that we want men who can think and act we are just as steadfast however in proclaiming that the supreme object in training is to produce unity of action these two aims are not mutually exclusive in fact they are complementary halves of an enlightened battle discipline Yeah and if you're a business situation we just like put out word like like just something stupid like like you'll be in a store or something and people people will be like not knowing hey there's just someone say but I'm going to bring it up back to the book now I do not think I've seen it stated in the military manuals of this age or in any of the writing's meant for the instruction of those who lead troops that a commander of infantry will be well advised to believe that when he engages the enemy not more than one quarter of his men will ever strike a real blow unless they are compelled by almost overpowering circumstances or unless all junior leaders constantly ride herd on troops with specific mission of increasing their fire the 25% estimate stands for even for well trained and campaign season troops I mean that 75% will not fire or will not persist in firing against the enemy and his works these men may face danger but will not fight so that's his hypothesis and actually the beginning of this book has a forward in it that I'm just going to touch on the forwards written by a guy named Russell Glenn and he he points out some of the disputes against this about this low ratio of fire so here we go back to the book this is the introduction so this isn't SLA Marshall this is from the introduction from Russell Glenn Marshall's ratio of fire values did not go unchallenged even when they first appeared in 1947 general James and Gavin World War II commander of the 82nd airborne division discounted the low estimates as did Harry W.O. Kennard who served in the 101st airborne division in every one of its combat actions during World War II and later commanded the first cavalry division in Vietnam legendary general Bruce Clark commander of the US forces that defended St. Viff during the battle of the bulge flatly discounted Marshall finding his values ridiculous and dangerous assertions absolute nonsense another combat veteran british author George McDonald Fraser instead question Marshall's explanation for why soldiers failed to engage the enemy Fraser had served so one of the things that Marshall says is and mental energy by the way like like for like you can't go in one direction mentally and just pivot real quick and be like yeah let me just mentally accommodate this you know it's like man it takes more thought than that and and I talked to the parent and said hey you got one confident kid you know with speech impediment how did you get him to overcome you know this this speech impediment or the it's not so much the speech impediment because he didn't overcome it's still had it but guess what was going to talk your ear off and was going to sit down and act professional and get it convey his message and the response was got him to talk to people all the time and and made him talk to people and so that's what you do get have conversation with your kids how's that you have conversations with your people on your team how's that is that one of the reasons why podcasts are popular because you get to hear conversations between people because you're not here and so if you have negative respect for people's intelligence they're not going to do a good job big chunk a little bit of a big chunk here to square training with a reality of war it becomes a necessary part of the young officer's mental equipment for training to instill in him the full realization that in combat many things can and will go wrong without it being anyone's fault in particular so what did I just say things are going to happen is no one's fault does that really does that really marry up with the idea of extreme ownership well not really great because I'm taking ownership of anything however keep listening war is aimed at destruction the fire and general purpose of the enemy are directed against one's own personnel material and communications with the objective keeping one's own design from coming into play small plans miscarried because the wrong man happens to be hit at the critical moment or the guns which were counted on are knocked out of action the problem of command in battle is ever to establish a safe margin which will allow for such misadventure there you go so things are going to go wrong And but the real people who sang it, they're like, like I said, like, old, you know, funky, like kind of jazz type people from what I remember. even the video game thing it seems like there's like a step before that to for someone to get conditioned to killing because I don't know obviously might in less intense video game experiences like PlayStation 2 which seems like a long time ago or they get people fired they cost a bunch of money or something like you might not want to jump on their back immediately a man remains a man after he puts on a soldier suit death in the company is like a death in the family talk relieves tension okay talk relieves tension this is a tough one because guess what some people when something bad happens you know what they want to do they want to be left alone and then like kind of like how you meant you can from like wait, but this guy but then you know it's like it's the it's the that got to me. the you don't know what's going on the front lines if you don't have any idea if you can't even speak their language anymore you need to get down there you need to find out what's going on on the front lines businesses that means you too the diabolical effect of even such a relatively simple instrument as the field telephone is that it may come to command the commander the phone actually gets control of you it chains into a system of remote control at first he sees it only as a successful as a useful channel for quick communication and combat then he fears to leave it less it should require his presence in headquarters the moment after he leaves to go forward this state of mind in turn creates its own illusion fostering that fostering the conclusion that under the new system of war all matters can be settled at a distance all problems arising within the zone of fire can be fully understood without ever going there and all moral values which once attended the commander effort to impress his men with his personality and character are somehow sundered by the new technology of operations out of sedentary general ship arises evil of troops which while obeying mechanically have no organic thinking response to the commander's will yeah the video games are realistic but it seems like that they they have to get past a certain step to consider the video games as being training so you guys like when you guys were you know and see training you know in the seal team you guys are specifically training for that specific thing that was on your mind Like, to be like, hey, because, you know, I guess it could be said like, hey, you're kind of protecting other people from getting screwed in that same way. yeah see you get it that out if you want to no reds the same thing conceptually conceptually all right next back to the book and last if we are to strengthen sound training principles and establish mental attitudes which are essential to the understanding of the decisive importance of fire in tactics we will be well advised to cease talking about fire and movement as if the latter were separate and apart from the former in tactical fact there and there did not exist an automatic and unbreakable connection between them so now he's saying the same thing that I was saying earlier is fire is not more important they're the same thing fire maneuver cover move half to happen together that's what he's saying fire is the key to mobility to fire is to move so he goes on now this next section again this is great because next section is called the multiples of information so he said you got a rifleman that doesn't want to shoot give him a bigger more effective weapon he says this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to come from increased responsibility but it works I've seen many cases were men who had funked it badly with a rifle responded heroically when given a flame thrower or a bar self-pried and the ego are the touchstone of most these remarkable conversions a man may fail with the rifle because he feels anonymous and believes it nothing important is being asked of him so that's pretty cool because I talk about this all the time why could the earth because everyone has a rifle and he's like okay let's not really but I feel like there's this one kind of crucial step before that like you'd consider a slaughterhouse person like there's a difference between working in a slaughterhouse and being conditioned to the sight and the smell and the experience of doing it but not having the barrier that's like And that's the thing, like, just like I said, like, why not just get here that the people who were really saying those songs, they were older people. right so the first time now the first time not can these kids not conditioned in this way to you know to have the experience of killing somebody and watch them die and whatever so the first time they give them the gun they got you the kids shoots and what empties the clip right the kid was passed them that moral barrier long time ago but first time unconditioned as far as the experience goes he turns to the guard and goes hey can I have another magazine to do it and I'm not just talking about seals I'm talking about army infantrymen I'm talking about marines the guys are guys are not hesitating I mean broadly you could never make a statement like this could you make a statement that some people hesitate yes you could make that statement but to broadly say that only 15 to 25% of people are going to actively engage the enemy from everything I saw that's patently untrue now the advantage and what we had for an advantage and martial kind of claims this too is that once World War II is over and they started training us to shoot at one of the big objections it has that that guys were getting trained to shoot bulls eye targets and here we go getting the troops to that cohesiveness back to the book it may be done through one bold individual standing erect and saying to a few others follow me we are going on if a few rise and follow the entire line is apt to get in motion on the other hand if this same individual advances alone but says nothing it is unlikely that he will have any followers one word come makes his action tenfold as effective as if he plunges gauntly ahead in silence the act of moving is initiative the act of coupling motion with speech is thinking initiative and important very important here's talk about getting a gunfight the first thing you do is you hit the ground as reestablish contact with your men determine where they are and let them know where you are this this happens in business to something bad happens i don't know mean there were so in dictionaries i thought that was like a like a holy book i filled my mom at a ad a ad an oe de oxford english dictionary not the the four one is a volume the four one is twenty six volumes or something crazy like and then he gets to this point back to the book in the Pacific flighting I found company commanders joining a platoon in the line just to isolate themselves from their telephones they were literally tired to death of having the battalion commander insist on having a fresh progress report every 15 or 20 minutes and the battalion commander poor devil was only passing on the pressure which he had in turn received from a regimental commander who is trying to playkate division yet one would observe that unless a battalion commander is wholly lacking in judgment or intestinal fortitude he should be strong enough to take this on his aching back and not pass it down to the headquarters which is at grips with the enemy this happens all the time in the military for sure the senior commanders going I want to know what's going on and tell us that to the next junior guys is for my kids they're like what they were looking me like what what did you believe i didn't you know just because you you had to go to the library no to look something up get an encyclopedia i remember thinking in cyclopedias were were like holy like hey you can give that order but until everybody kind of knows that it's a good plan we're not knowing here's another good statement by rough approximation 60% of the art of command is the ability to anticipate 40% of the art of command is the ability to improvise to reject the preconceived idea that has been tested and proved wrong in the crucible of operations and to rule by action instead of acting by rules that's a good one by the way that's the entire art of command that's 100% anticipation and ability to improvise obviously there's some more factors those are some important ones and I don't think I pulled it out but you got to throw some other stuff out back to the book the darkest hour for the novice in war comes with the recoil after the unit has been had badly hit it is then that the young commander has greatest need of the friendship and steadiness of his superior or of any other officer whose judgment he respects criticism or tactical counsel are of no value at this time they can be given that later of necessary but in the wrong hour they add to the hurt led him get out his crying towel when he has told how it happened the important thing is that he be given a pat on the back and insurance and assurance that he did his full duty and some little reminder that while he may feel that his losses are excessive such incidents are unavoidable feature of combat and do not keep one from coming back in the next round in secret in sick freed sassons memories of an infantry man the young lieutenant tells of emerging from a bloody trench raid and meeting his kernel this was kind kernel kynjak and we all go into panic mode and start focusing on our world as a leader you need to say okay guys here's what's going on here's where I am here's what we're going to do leadership leadership leadership leadership leadership the majority of small unit leaders do not take any steps toward restoring control from which alone can come unity of action some try to contact their men by voice or by relay a voice during an action while the matter prone the voice will rarely carry more than 25 feet this means that unless there is a relay of all hands under and and all hands understand what is being attempted the voice method is ineffective in the seal teams when somebody yells out a command everybody says it and it's the best it's the coolest thing it's not the coolest thing i'm doing that right now i'm going with my cell phone but everyone around here's a thing though with that everyone around you kind of feel the same thing so like for example if you go to the store or if i go to the store people know Well, there's like a reporter, like a news reporter who's like Sadie was in a helicopter and it got to fire. I'm all find out what's going on and that guy says I'll find out what's going on and the people in the front line they can't even fight because they're too busy trying to answer the damn questions from up the chain of command so don't let that happen back to the book in the burden island fight during the invasion of the marshals one of these prodding demands for more progress raised from division right through lower headquarters to a platoon which had been stopped cold by japfire coming from spider holes arranged in great depth along the beach the lieutenant got the message and crawling forward to the his most advanced riflemen told him to get up and go on the boy screamed so the whole goddamn army wants me to want to kill me and i thought i thought it's gonna be a late night on Sunday i thought midnight which you know i don't want to go to bed a midnight on the Sunday night i got to god done it's like 945 at night i was like I mean we would shoot little round targets what were they called head plates right we're shooting at heads we're shooting body shots we're shooting that's what we do all the time and we shoot so we shoot targets with pictures on them with faces on them that look like people and then on top of that we did force on force training where we're actually shooting paint balls or semi-unition at other human beings and we're gunning them down so there's a lot of conditioning that we had that maybe that's why we were so much more apt and able and willing to shoot You know, like saying that is different than like this explosion was literally, you know, 200 feet in there. yeah some kind of just seems so filled with knowledge and if you didn't know what a word was you just had to go look it up and that thing you didn't know what a thing was you look it up in the encyclopedias you go library and look it up in the encyclopedias nowadays you're three seconds away you got Wait shorter too like the kind like I can like literally literally walk about 15 meters. He's like, he's like, he's like, this is surprisingly good. it's like you got to cover and move that's that's to me they go hand in hand which actually he says back the book fundamentally fire must always be beaten by fire fundamentally movement is the means of increasing the efficiency of ones own fire until the last strength of the enemy's fire is reduced to a vanish point i mean do you ever forget your do you have that at all like when you leave your phone at home or in the car something like that where you don't have it for like oh how's this I ask the guy not like in that line because it's where ahead I ask the guy in the next line who's like maybe two three people ahead of me but in a different line. But what if you didn't really get to where you wanted to be, and now you accelerated him, and he turned to get, you know, I mean, that's, that's a very tough decision to make, and that's why that's why you gotta be, that's why you gotta be tactfully, you gotta think about what's going on. He was like, you know, you got heavy, but nonetheless, the point is, it's like, hey I know this is I'm not training for anything specifically I'm just sort of doing it whether it be for fun or to get better at shooting or better at this game or whatever if you're not past the moral objection part is it really training you to be less more morally well let's say if you're a kid that's like got some major issues and you're thinking about doing a school shooting and i'm so stoked but like you said it's like like i can't literally just cannot see but it means like get fired up like it's like dope You know like I'm like yeah, It's kind of like, don't like what you call, you need, you know, money, the waters or whatever. They were like old, like 50s or something like that. So boom, I go in and you know pancake mix is like a certain kind of mix to create like a pancake. And I think the weird thing is social people that don't, they don't, they don't, they don't be coming around me if they, I kind of give off the vibe of like, hey, you don't want to be acting that way around me. yeah get down talk the troops here we talk about this is a part of the nature of the combat soldier once he loses that faith it becomes very difficult to resolve it he will lose it very quickly when he sees that casualties are wasted on useless operations or when he begins to feel that he is in any respect the victim of bad planning or faulty concepts that's important then he responds to that principle which was once well stated by general james harbored discipline and moral influence the inarticulate vote that is constantly taken by masses of men when the order comes to move forward when the order comes to move forward a variant of the crowd psychology that inclines it to follow a leader but the army does not move forward until the motion is carried unanimous consent only follows cooperation between the invid individual men in ranks that's a bold statement so i mean this is a very important especially for folks that are in the military or in services where you can take losses and that is when you're in charge it's the time is not then to provide tactical counsel right that's not the time first you got to let the person get over the emotional hump help them through that and if you got to go back and debrief later that's what you do i think everybody needs to pay attention to that so the communication things here's the other thing that happens with modern communications text messaging emails you start losing that little personal touch which is important here we go back to the book with his characteristically warm humor general Eisenhower has commented on the value of the personal factor in the command relation to his men under the conditions of modern war i found that it did a great deal of good to get down to my troops in the combat area my presence relax them and made them feel more comfortable about the situation You can't like, but I don't like people taking people's money. but you know that's a great thing to talk about raising kids to make sure you talk to your kids I work with someone once had had a kid that had like a speech impediment and this kid would just sit down and talk your ear off with speech impediment so it's not just a small little response or you who doesn't have time to send one text well the thing is yeah physically sending the text doesn't take any time but to consider you're a valid or appropriate response to most text and in a special in your case where you get messages legit messages you can just be like cool And now we talk about the name of the chapters combat isolation and he starts talking about what it's like when these soldiers get on the battlefield he's talking about the battlefield's cold and it's harsh and it's empty and there's it's chills a man's soul is what he's saying and then when the fire starts here we go back to the book he finds himself suddenly almost alone in his hour of greatest danger and he can feel the danger but there is nothing out there, nothing to contend against. Yeah this long long like a long line like there was a crowd. It really illustrated that that concept like how we talk about all the time where When someone says good like that, it really stands out now. and I always say well what he got the team to do is get everyone in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time like if you can do that you're winning if you can do that as a leader if you can get everybody in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time you're going to win Like, that's not a small, like your memory is not going to forget that, right? yeah you got to know that's like we're saying something a couple years ago so it's kind of like a pay attention kind of thing like it's a I think they're like saving up from, you know, cause sometimes that's how, you know, you save up for your geat, whatever.
