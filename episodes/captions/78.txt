[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 78 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:12] Nightmare.
[00:00:16] Now that's a word that I use often times to describe the most horrible things and the most
[00:00:24] wretched things and in my hierarchy of adjectives, nightmare is right alongside of hell.
[00:00:38] And I'm not sure which one is worse in my mind.
[00:00:41] That's why I say they're right alongside each other because hell is beyond the worst thing
[00:00:47] your mind can imagine.
[00:00:49] And that's basically what a nightmare is when you're asleep and your mind delves into
[00:00:58] the most horrific things beyond what you can consciously and willfully imagine in your
[00:01:05] own head.
[00:01:09] That's what a nightmare is.
[00:01:10] Now what if there was a place that was worse than a
[00:01:19] nightmare?
[00:01:22] And it was a real place.
[00:01:26] Who could create such a place?
[00:01:36] And the answer to that is we can.
[00:01:44] I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner who
[00:01:50] threw himself about and asleep obviously having a horrible nightmare.
[00:01:57] Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffer from fearful dreams or
[00:02:01] deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man.
[00:02:06] Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him frightened at the thing I was
[00:02:10] about to do.
[00:02:13] At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream no matter how horrible
[00:02:21] could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us and to which I was about
[00:02:29] to recall him.
[00:02:34] And that's a quote from the book, Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Franco which will
[00:02:41] be appearing in two today.
[00:02:45] And it's a book about the Nazi concentration camps which are really as he pointed out
[00:02:55] there worse than any nightmare we can imagine.
[00:03:02] Here's a Holocaust survivor.
[00:03:05] He won't be Weinstein on the death and the atrocities in Treblinka.
[00:03:15] By now the transports were coming every day.
[00:03:18] One was much like the next, the same incidents recurred again and again.
[00:03:23] Once as I swept out the interior of a car, an SS man suddenly struck me with his weapon
[00:03:28] ordered me to help a woman who was unable to stand and climb out of the car.
[00:03:34] The idea was to show his victims how well the ill would be treated.
[00:03:40] Then he ordered one of the workers to take the woman to the field, the field hospital
[00:03:46] for care.
[00:03:49] The newcomers really believed that the alien woman would be taken to an infermary.
[00:03:55] None of them realized that the field hospital was in fact just a giant pit about 30 yards
[00:04:01] in diameter which was always a blaze.
[00:04:06] They would place those who were sick or disabled on the ground at the edge of the pit facing
[00:04:12] in.
[00:04:13] The SS man in charge circulated among them and shot them in the back of the neck.
[00:04:19] Then the workers cast them into the pit.
[00:04:22] Some of the victims were still breathing when they were tossed in with the other bodies.
[00:04:28] The pit was separated from the spacious field by a barrier of fresh pine branches which
[00:04:34] were replaced from time to time to conceal the infirmary from the newcomers until the last
[00:04:40] moment.
[00:04:42] 20 minutes after I helped the woman climb out of the railroad car, I was told that some
[00:04:47] infants were sitting by the pit and no one else was there because the SS soldier had taken
[00:04:53] his lunch break.
[00:04:55] I gathered some trash and went over there.
[00:04:58] I saw the woman who I had removed from the car, still breathing, sitting at the edge
[00:05:02] of the pit and staring in fright into the burning inferno and its contents.
[00:05:08] The half-cremated bodies of old people and children mixed with smoldering trash.
[00:05:16] She tried to stand up but her legs would not hold her.
[00:05:21] She looked at the workers who stirred the embers remnants of human beings so they would burn
[00:05:27] better.
[00:05:31] Nearby we were about a dozen infants.
[00:05:34] Too young to have learned how to walk, they were not crying.
[00:05:38] They certainly did not understand what was happening.
[00:05:42] They looked about almost certainly in hopes of finding their mother or father.
[00:05:49] Later I heard that right after he returned from his lunch break, the SS man shot them all
[00:05:53] and ordered the workers to throw the tiny bodies into the flames.
[00:05:59] Of all my memories of that accursed place, the vision of these babies is undoubtedly the worst.
[00:06:08] I see their faces whenever I remember Trimblinka.
[00:06:13] As I write these lines more than 50 years after that day, I still cannot overcome the horror.
[00:06:28] In another report, here Martin's Spet of Tarnow, Poland, describes the massacre of Tarnow
[00:06:36] Jews in an interview.
[00:06:40] We heard the columns of Jews under German escort at night.
[00:06:44] It was going constantly.
[00:06:46] They were passing our house because this was already on the outskirts of the city, the
[00:06:51] cemetery and they were marching them to the woods behind the city.
[00:06:56] As we found out later, they were all shot over there.
[00:07:01] During the day I looked out through the shingles.
[00:07:03] My father said I shouldn't look but anyway, I was a kid, I was curious.
[00:07:09] The roof was overlooking the cemetery and wagons with bodies dead bodies were coming in.
[00:07:16] Groups, they were bringing in groups of Jewish people that had to dig trenches.
[00:07:22] They had to dig ditches and the bodies dumped in.
[00:07:26] After those Jews that dug the ditches, they were shot also and pushed in by another
[00:07:33] group that came in after them into those ditches and lime was poured over the bodies.
[00:07:39] The next group covered up those ditches and dug other ditches.
[00:07:48] They brought in pregnant women and they didn't use any bullets.
[00:07:59] They used bayonets.
[00:08:04] The screams of the mothers that their children, they tore their children out of their arms
[00:08:16] and the screams of the children, I still hear.
[00:08:27] The Solomon Redaski, who is the only survivor from the 78 people in his family.
[00:08:40] Described the concentration camp, they throw the people in the crematoriums that children.
[00:08:49] I will never forget alive.
[00:08:54] They throw them in the crematoriums.
[00:09:00] They grabbed by an arm, by a leg, by the head and throw them into the ovens.
[00:09:05] There it was so tragic.
[00:09:07] The cries and people, when crying there, you know it was so terrible.
[00:09:15] I can feel it now.
[00:09:16] I can even see the people.
[00:09:21] The other people were crying, the children were hollering, Mama Daddy helped me.
[00:09:28] Mama Daddy helped me.
[00:09:35] It was terrible.
[00:09:46] One more report, not Trublinka, from Henry Gold.
[00:09:53] The worst thing that happens to a person in that instance, he loses self-respect, and
[00:10:00] that's exactly what happened to the majority of the people.
[00:10:04] Some of them even lost their minds.
[00:10:06] They couldn't take it.
[00:10:08] They couldn't take the hunger.
[00:10:09] They couldn't take the beatings.
[00:10:10] They couldn't take the cold, no clothing, and the uncertainty.
[00:10:15] And the uncertainty, I think that was the worst thing that could happen to a person.
[00:10:19] You didn't know from one moment to the next what was going to happen.
[00:10:24] Life was very cheap.
[00:10:25] A person was alive one minute.
[00:10:27] The next minute he was shot, killed, beaten up, beaten to death, torn apart by dogs, and so
[00:10:34] on.
[00:10:37] Life was very, very cheap, and that's the way the Germans liked it.
[00:10:43] That particular camp was governed by the Jewish police and so on.
[00:10:48] The Germans did not stay in the camp.
[00:10:50] They were on the outside.
[00:10:54] But the life inside of the camp was just as bad without the Germans being right there
[00:10:59] than if they would be.
[00:11:03] The Jewish police was, I don't know.
[00:11:08] You take a person in that situation, and you give them a little power, and he becomes
[00:11:12] the same as the oppressor himself.
[00:11:17] There were some policemen that were not bad, but there were a lot of them that were ruthless.
[00:11:24] There were others that would beat people, and do all kinds of things that would degrade
[00:11:28] them and so on, especially women.
[00:11:32] They cut their hair off, and they looked like men.
[00:11:35] They looked like scarecrows, and they would get beaten up by the Jewish police just as bad
[00:11:40] as the man for no reason at all.
[00:11:45] If they wanted a little more soup, where they were distributing soup, and there was some
[00:11:50] left, and they were going to give everybody a little bit, and the Jewish police with their
[00:11:55] sticks and rubber hoses would beat them half-centeless.
[00:12:03] That's what happens when the conditions are the way they were then.
[00:12:07] When a person becomes an animal, and loses self-respect, that is willing to get a beating,
[00:12:13] and get beaten half-centeless just to get a little bit of soup.
[00:12:21] Either you died, or if you didn't die, the Germans would come and take you away.
[00:12:29] The filth was just terrible in the camp.
[00:12:32] In the barracks you had caught.
[00:12:33] I mean, bonks were everybody slept on straw, there were no covers, was no pillows, nothing.
[00:12:40] You slept in your clothes and the winners, and the winner because you're afraid to get
[00:12:43] cold.
[00:12:45] The only heating was a pop belly stove in the middle of the barrack.
[00:12:49] When somebody stole some wood in the factory or something, then we had a fire otherwise
[00:12:53] it was freezing.
[00:12:57] They only warmth they had if you huddled together and they kept warm that way, but nobody
[00:13:04] would get undressed.
[00:13:06] The lights were eating you up alive.
[00:13:10] Once a month you were allowed to take a shower, and we had to walk to camp a to go to the
[00:13:14] showers, and that means a 10-mile walk.
[00:13:19] 10 miles there and 10 miles back.
[00:13:23] There were a lot of people were too weak to walk, and those people hardly ever took a shower.
[00:13:30] There was no hot water in the washer, there was only cold, and in the winter you were
[00:13:34] afraid to wash up because there was nothing to wipe yourself with, therefore you would
[00:13:39] walk out in the cold, winter, and freeze to death.
[00:13:50] And we gold, brothers and both of his parents were all killed in the gas chambers.
[00:14:02] And from the Boocan walled report, which was translated and edited with an introduction
[00:14:09] by David A. Hackett, I will now describe the crematoriums and the transports.
[00:14:16] With the station 2,000 people got off the trains.
[00:14:20] They had to throw away all their luggage.
[00:14:23] Afterwards, the men and women were divided into two groups, at which the larger boys were
[00:14:27] assigned to the group with the men.
[00:14:32] Then that great devour of Jews, Mengala drove by and a car seeking out the strongest
[00:14:37] from each transport.
[00:14:40] They numbered around 30 out of 2,000.
[00:14:43] The remainder were led away by SS Technical Sergeant Moll, the officer of the crematorium.
[00:14:52] The elderly were loaded onto dump trucks and then dumped into burning trenches while
[00:14:56] still alive.
[00:14:59] The remainder were led to the gas chambers.
[00:15:03] Meanwhile new transports were arriving.
[00:15:07] In front of the gas chamber was a dressing room.
[00:15:11] Its walls were written in all languages, put shoes into the cubby holes and tie them together
[00:15:16] so you will not lose them.
[00:15:19] After the showers, you will receive hot coffee.
[00:15:24] Here poor victims undress themselves and went into the chamber.
[00:15:30] There were three columns for the ventilators through which the gas poured in.
[00:15:36] Special worked detail with trungeons drove the people into the chamber.
[00:15:41] When the room was full, small children were thrown in through a window.
[00:15:47] Sergeant Moll grabbed, infants by their legs and smashed their skulls against the wall.
[00:15:54] Then the gas was led into the chamber.
[00:15:58] The lungs of the victim slowly burst and after three minutes allowed clamoring could
[00:16:02] be heard.
[00:16:05] And the chamber was open and those who still showed signs of life were beaten to death.
[00:16:17] The prisoners of the special work details then pulled corpses out took their rings off
[00:16:23] and cut their hair which was gathered up, put in sacks and shipped to factories.
[00:16:29] Then they arranged the corpses in piles of ten each.
[00:16:34] After Sergeant Moll had counted them, they were taken to the ovens or if the crematoriums,
[00:16:39] crematoriums were insufficient thrown into fire trenches.
[00:16:45] Once it happened that a victim crawled out of a burning trench, he was beaten to death with
[00:16:49] trungeons.
[00:16:54] While Sergeant Moll put a naked woman in the trench and shot her in the genitals, another
[00:17:01] time Moll found a ring on a member of the special work detail.
[00:17:05] He ordered, nap, nap the poured over him and had it lighted.
[00:17:12] He hanged a man by his hands and shot him until his arms were torn through.
[00:17:18] Then he hanged him up by the feet and repeated the process.
[00:17:25] While Sergeant Moll took a family of six, first he shot the youngest in the presence
[00:17:31] of the rest, then he shot the older ones and finally their father and mother.
[00:17:45] That's the testimony of John DeWise, who was 15 years old at Burknow.
[00:18:03] So I think it's safe to say that this is a situation that has definitely worse than a nightmare.
[00:18:15] And what possibly can we take away from that?
[00:18:24] I think the best thing we can do is try and learn.
[00:18:35] And I think one of the best places to learn and take lessons away from the Holocaust is from
[00:18:42] the book that I started out with today called Man Search for Meaning by Victor Franco.
[00:18:53] Let's go to the book.
[00:19:02] Let us take the case of a transport, which was officially announced to transfer a certain
[00:19:07] number of prisoners to another camp.
[00:19:09] But it was fairly safe to guess that its final destination would be the gas chambers.
[00:19:15] A selection of sick or feeble prisoners incapable of work would be sent to one of the big
[00:19:20] central camps which were fitted with gas chambers and crematoriums.
[00:19:26] The selection process was the signal for a free fight among all the prisoners, or of group
[00:19:34] against group.
[00:19:36] All that matter was that one's own name and that of one's friends were crossed off the
[00:19:42] list of victims, though everyone knew that for each man saved another victim had to be
[00:19:48] found.
[00:19:51] A definite number of prisoners had to go with each transport.
[00:19:56] It did not really matter which since each of them was nothing but a number.
[00:20:02] On their admission to the camp, all their documents had been taken from them, together
[00:20:08] with other possessions.
[00:20:10] Each prisoner therefore had an opportunity to claim a fictitious name or profession
[00:20:14] and for various reasons many did this.
[00:20:18] The authorities were interested only in the captive's numbers.
[00:20:23] These numbers were often tattooed on their skin and also had to be sewn to a certain
[00:20:27] spot on their trousers jacket or coat.
[00:20:31] He guard who wanted to make a charge against a prisoner just a glance that is number.
[00:20:37] And how we dreaded those glances.
[00:20:39] He never asked for his name.
[00:20:43] To return to the convoy about to depart, there was neither time nor desire to consider
[00:20:47] moral or ethical issues.
[00:20:50] Every man was controlled by one fought only to keep himself alive for the family waiting
[00:20:55] for him at home and to save his friends.
[00:20:59] If no hesitation therefore he would arrange for another prisoner another number to take
[00:21:05] his place in the transport.
[00:21:11] As I have already mentioned, the process of selecting capos was a negative one.
[00:21:16] Only the most brutal of the prisoners were chosen for this job.
[00:21:22] So capos were prisoners, Jewish prisoners that got selected to help run the prison camp.
[00:21:33] And capo, I tried to find the etymology of where that came from and the best or the closest
[00:21:40] or the thing that made the most sense to me from what I read was, was they had two words
[00:21:46] combined together.
[00:21:48] Tom Rad Police and the German those got shortened to capo.
[00:21:57] So some of these and you already heard one of those earlier testimonies talking about
[00:22:02] the Jewish police inside the prisons and how they were just as bad as in many cases
[00:22:09] as the Germans themselves.
[00:22:13] Back to the book.
[00:22:14] But apart from the selection of capos which was undertaken by the SS there was a sort
[00:22:18] of self-selecting process going on the whole time among all the prisoners.
[00:22:26] On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who.
[00:22:30] After years of trekking from camp to camp had lost all scruples in their fight for
[00:22:36] existence.
[00:22:37] They were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise even brutal force, theft and
[00:22:43] betrayal of friends in order to save themselves.
[00:22:49] We have come back by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles, whatever one may choose
[00:22:57] to call them.
[00:22:58] We know the best of us did not return.
[00:23:10] So there is a dynamic that you don't think of immediately when you think of the concentration
[00:23:14] camps.
[00:23:15] Number one, you don't think about the capos, the Jewish police that are forced into this
[00:23:20] situation.
[00:23:21] And then the other thing you don't think about is this the fact that the people that
[00:23:25] we're going to survive were basically making a very broad say.
[00:23:31] But from what Victor Frankl saying here, it was the people that were willing just to do
[00:23:35] anything to survive, including betraying their friends.
[00:23:38] And he's saying straight up, we know the best of us did not return.
[00:23:43] And that is something that you don't think about.
[00:23:52] And we probably don't think about it because we don't want to think about it.
[00:23:55] Because when you start thinking about what would you do to survive?
[00:24:00] What would you do to survive?
[00:24:02] What would I do to survive?
[00:24:06] That's a question. I don't think a lot of people want to know the answer to.
[00:24:11] And it's very easy to go through life and never have to answer that question.
[00:24:16] Just talking a little bit now about what life was like in the camp.
[00:24:27] Back to the book.
[00:24:28] Somewhere it is said that man cannot exist without sleep for more than a stated number
[00:24:31] of hours.
[00:24:32] Quite wrong.
[00:24:34] I had been convinced that there were certain things I just could not do.
[00:24:38] I could not sleep without this or I could not live without that or the other.
[00:24:44] The first night in Auschwitz, we slept in beds which were constructed in tears.
[00:24:50] On each tier, measuring about six and one half to eight feet slept nine men.
[00:24:56] Directly on the boards.
[00:24:58] Two blankets would be shared by each nine men.
[00:25:03] We could of course lie only on our sides, crowded and huddled against each other,
[00:25:09] which had some advantages because of the bitter cold.
[00:25:13] Though it was forbidden to take shoes up to the bunks, some people did use them secretly
[00:25:18] as pillows, and spite of the fact that they were caked with mud.
[00:25:22] Otherwise, one's head had to rest on the crook of an almost dislocated arm.
[00:25:29] And yet sleep came and brought oblivion and relief from the pain for a few hours.
[00:25:39] The thaw to suicide was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time.
[00:25:45] It was born of hopelessness of the situation, the constant danger of death looming over us
[00:25:51] daily and hourly, and the closeness of deaths suffered by many of the others.
[00:25:58] In personal convictions, which we mentioned later, I made a firm promise on my first evening
[00:26:03] in the camp that I would not run to the wire.
[00:26:07] This was a phrase used in camp to describe the most popular method of suicide, touching
[00:26:12] the electrical, electrically charged barbed wire fence.
[00:26:15] It was not entirely difficult for me to make this decision.
[00:26:20] There was little point committing suicide since, for the average inmate, life expectation
[00:26:25] calculating objectively and counting all likely chances was very poor.
[00:26:32] You could not without any assurance, you could not with any assurance expect to be among
[00:26:35] the small percentage of men who survived all the selections.
[00:26:40] The prisoner of Auschwitz, in the first phase of shock, did not fear death.
[00:26:45] Even the gas chambers lost their horrors for him after the first few days after all.
[00:26:52] They spared him the act of committing suicide.
[00:27:02] Victor Frankle was a psychiatrist going into this situation.
[00:27:11] That's the view, that's the perspective that he takes throughout this.
[00:27:17] He's now been in for a couple days in Auschwitz and another guy comes into talk to him,
[00:27:27] who's another colleague of his.
[00:27:30] And we're going back to the book, a colleague of mine who had arrived in Auschwitz several
[00:27:33] weeks previously smuggled himself into our hut.
[00:27:36] He wanted a common comfort us and tell us a few things.
[00:27:40] He had become so thin that at first we did not recognize him.
[00:27:44] With a show of good humor and a devil-made care attitude he gave us a few hurried tips.
[00:27:49] Don't be afraid, don't fear the selections.
[00:27:52] Dr. M, the SS medical chief, has a soft spot for doctors.
[00:27:58] But one thing I beg of you, he continued, shave daily if at all possible even if you have
[00:28:04] to use a piece of glass to do it.
[00:28:06] Even if you have to give your last piece of bread for it.
[00:28:11] You will look younger and the scraping will make your cheeks look rudier.
[00:28:16] If you want to stay alive, there is only one way.
[00:28:19] Look fit for work.
[00:28:21] If you even limp because let us say you have a small blister on your heel and an SS man
[00:28:26] spots this, he will wave you aside and the next day you are sure to be gasped.
[00:28:40] Now his mind and his thoughts, he describes what he would think about.
[00:28:52] Back to the book, my mind still clung to the image of my wife.
[00:28:58] A thought crossed my mind, I didn't even know if she was still alive.
[00:29:03] I knew only one thing which I have learned well by now.
[00:29:08] Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved.
[00:29:13] It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, in his inner self.
[00:29:19] Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all ceases
[00:29:23] somehow to be of importance.
[00:29:28] I did not know whether my wife was alive and had no means of finding out.
[00:29:35] Everything was happening all my present life, there was no outgoing or incoming male.
[00:29:40] But at that moment it ceased to matter.
[00:29:45] There was no need for me to know nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts
[00:29:49] and the image of my beloved.
[00:29:53] Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I still would have given myself
[00:29:58] undisturbed by that knowledge to the contemplation of her image.
[00:30:02] That my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying.
[00:30:12] Set me like a seal upon my heart, love is as strong as death.
[00:30:28] And continuing on, Dr. Frankle talks about images from inside the camp.
[00:30:37] Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with
[00:30:41] clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors from steel blue to blood red.
[00:30:47] The desolate gray mud huts provided a sharp contrast while the puddles on the muddy ground
[00:30:53] reflected the glowing sky.
[00:30:57] And then after a few minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, how beautiful
[00:31:02] the world could be.
[00:31:08] And beyond looking for beauty around them, they were able to find humor.
[00:31:18] And I have people ask me about this from time to time about humor and combat situations
[00:31:23] and isn't it important and yes it absolutely is, and you'd think in a concentration camp
[00:31:29] even humor would go away.
[00:31:35] But not true, back to the book to discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration
[00:31:39] camp must be surprising enough for an outsider.
[00:31:42] But he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor.
[00:31:49] And if I'm not able to find a sense of humor there as well, of course only the faint trace
[00:31:53] of one.
[00:31:54] And then only for a few seconds or minutes, humor was another of the soul's weapons in the
[00:31:59] fight for self preservation.
[00:32:03] It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human makeup, can afford an
[00:32:08] aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation if only for a few seconds.
[00:32:16] The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind
[00:32:21] of trick I learned while mastering the art of living.
[00:32:26] Yet it is impossible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp although
[00:32:31] suffering is omnipresent.
[00:32:34] To draw an analogy, a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas.
[00:32:40] If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely
[00:32:45] and evenly no matter how big the chamber.
[00:32:50] Thus, suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind no matter whether the
[00:32:55] suffering is great or little.
[00:32:59] Therefore the size of human suffering is absolutely relative.
[00:33:08] And I think the point that I took away from that was that chamber that can be filled up
[00:33:14] with suffering filled up with some humor as well.
[00:33:18] Otherwise that suffering will just fill the whole chamber, fill your whole brain.
[00:33:27] Back to the book, we were grateful for the smallest of mercies.
[00:33:30] We were glad when there was time to delouse before going to bed.
[00:33:35] Although in itself this was no pressure as it meant standing naked and unheated
[00:33:40] hut where icicles hung from the ceiling.
[00:33:44] But we were thankful if there was no air raid alarm during this operation in the lights
[00:33:49] were not switched off.
[00:33:52] We could not do the job properly.
[00:33:54] We were kept awake half the night.
[00:34:04] So you're at a point in life where you're grateful for being able to stand naked and pick
[00:34:10] the lights off of your friends before you go to bed so that the lights won't keep you awake
[00:34:15] at night by chewing at your body.
[00:34:23] And you know I talked about how or he talks about how it was the person that was going
[00:34:31] to survive had to be ruthless basically.
[00:34:36] And here he says, but is not for me to pass judgment on those prisoners who put their own
[00:34:40] people above everyone else.
[00:34:42] Who controls snowen in a man who favors his friends under circumstances when sooner
[00:34:46] later it is a question of life or death.
[00:34:50] No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation
[00:34:56] he might not have done the same.
[00:35:06] And here he says, I mentioned earlier how everything that was not connected with the immediate
[00:35:11] task of keeping oneself in one closest friends of lives lost its value.
[00:35:18] Everything was sacrificed to this end.
[00:35:22] The man's character became involved to the point that he was caught in mental turmoil which
[00:35:29] threatened all values he held and threw them into doubt.
[00:35:33] Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human
[00:35:38] dignity which had robbed the man of his will and made him an object to be exterminated,
[00:35:44] having planned however to make full use of him first to the last ounce of his physical
[00:35:48] resources under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values.
[00:35:56] If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to
[00:36:01] save his self respect he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind
[00:36:10] with inner freedom and personal value.
[00:36:16] He thought of himself then as only part of an enormous mass of people his existence descended
[00:36:23] to the level of animal life.
[00:36:28] The men were herded sometimes to one place then to another sometimes driven together
[00:36:32] than a part like a flock of sheep without a thought or a will of their own.
[00:36:39] A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides well versed in methods of torture
[00:36:45] and sadism.
[00:36:47] They drove the herd and sessingly backwards and forwards with shouts kicks and blows and
[00:36:54] we the sheep thought of two things only.
[00:37:00] How to evade the bad dogs and how to get a little food.
[00:37:15] He's going to delve into this deeper, this idea of this inner freedom and how hard you
[00:37:23] had to fight to maintain that and how easy it was just to roll in and become one of the
[00:37:30] pack one of the herd.
[00:37:36] Back to the book, it is very difficult for an outsider to grasp how very little value
[00:37:40] was placed on human life and camp.
[00:37:44] The camp inmate was hardened, possibly became more conscious of this complete disregard
[00:37:52] of human existence when a convoy of sick men was arranged.
[00:37:58] The initiated bodies of the sick were thrown on two wheeled carts which were drawn by prisoners
[00:38:04] for many miles, often through snowstorms to the next camp.
[00:38:09] If one of the sick men had died before the cart left, he was thrown on anyways.
[00:38:14] The list had to be correct, but the list was the only thing that mattered.
[00:38:21] A man counted only because he had a prison number.
[00:38:26] One literally became a number, dead or alive, that was unimportant.
[00:38:32] The life of a number was completely irrelevant.
[00:38:36] What stood behind that number and that life mattered even less.
[00:38:41] The fate, the history, the name of the man.
[00:38:57] The camp inmate was frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative
[00:39:03] whatsoever.
[00:39:06] This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one's master and that one must
[00:39:11] not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course.
[00:39:19] In addition, there was a great apathy which contributed no small part to the feelings
[00:39:26] of the prisoner.
[00:39:28] At times, lightning decisions had to be made.
[00:39:34] Decisions with spelled life or death.
[00:39:37] The prisoner would have preferred to let fate make the choice for him.
[00:39:44] Some of the examples that he brings up in the book on that are, they'd get told, we need
[00:39:48] people to go to a different camp for rest.
[00:39:54] They had no idea.
[00:39:55] Sometimes it actually was.
[00:39:56] Sometimes it was some kind of actual medical facility.
[00:40:01] Sometimes it was just you're going to the gas chambers at another camp and they had no
[00:40:05] idea which one it was.
[00:40:07] They got into this mode of they were just going to externally just whatever was going
[00:40:12] to happen.
[00:40:13] They go beyond when they're trying to begin to get me off that list or I want to be on that
[00:40:20] list and they realize that they were messing with fate.
[00:40:24] They got into a mode of, I'm just going to let things happen and whatever happens happens.
[00:40:31] You get this feeling of apathy.
[00:40:36] You can just imagine how that, that having no control externally of what's happening, how
[00:40:42] that leads.
[00:40:43] Number one leads to this apathy of just I don't care what happens.
[00:40:48] But number two, how that can then sneak in and start to get control of your inner
[00:40:53] thoughts and your inner feelings where you just feel like you don't have control over
[00:40:56] anything in life and that's it.
[00:40:58] And here he talks about apathy some more.
[00:41:01] The prisoners apathy was also the result of other factors, hunger and lack of sleep contributed
[00:41:07] to it as they do in normal life also.
[00:41:13] And to the general irritability which was another characteristic of the prisoner's mental
[00:41:17] state.
[00:41:19] The lack of sleep was partly due to the pestering of vermin which infested the terribly
[00:41:23] overcrowded huts because of the general lack of hygiene and sanitation.
[00:41:29] The fact that we had neither nicotine nor caffeine also contributed to the state of apathy
[00:41:34] and irritability.
[00:41:37] Besides these physical causes, there were mental ones.
[00:41:41] In the form of certain complexes, the majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority
[00:41:46] complex.
[00:41:48] We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be somebody.
[00:41:53] Now we were treated like complete non-entities.
[00:42:00] The consciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things.
[00:42:05] It cannot be shaken by camp life.
[00:42:08] But how many free men load alone prisoners possess it?
[00:42:14] Without consciously thinking about it, the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded.
[00:42:21] This became obvious when one observed the contrasts offered by the singular sociological
[00:42:26] structure of the camp.
[00:42:28] The more prominent prisoners, the capos, the cooks, the storekeepers and the camp policemen
[00:42:34] did not as a rule field degraded at all.
[00:42:38] Like the majority of prisoners, but on the contrary, they felt promoted.
[00:42:44] They even developed miniature delusions of grandeur.
[00:42:52] Clearly we can all take a lesson out of that one.
[00:42:56] That is, you know, you get put into a promotion position or you've got authority over
[00:43:01] people.
[00:43:02] Don't let that go to your head.
[00:43:03] Yeah, I guess that's a natural thing where they did this experiment test in the university
[00:43:10] whatever.
[00:43:11] Just from random students, one played the prisoner, one group played the guards and that
[00:43:15] happened.
[00:43:16] You know, like an actor, it's just an experiment.
[00:43:19] It's not real life, you know, it's still happened.
[00:43:21] Yeah, and it happened in real life, which I think is even more insane.
[00:43:26] See, even more insane.
[00:43:28] Yeah, and away, huh.
[00:43:31] But then again, how can we sit here in judge when if you're in that situation and you need
[00:43:39] to survive and you need to do the best to get you to survive in your family survive?
[00:43:43] And you have an opportunity, oh, are we going to say nope?
[00:43:47] Nope.
[00:43:48] I'm going to instead of doing this where I maybe can do something good in the long run.
[00:43:52] Nope.
[00:43:53] I'm not going to go across my values.
[00:43:55] I'm going to die in three days and that's it.
[00:43:57] Yeah.
[00:43:58] That's a hard decision to make.
[00:44:00] Yeah, I mean, it seems easy when you're sitting in the comfort of your home.
[00:44:04] Like, I wouldn't do that or, you know, and this is what I would have done or I wouldn't
[00:44:09] have done.
[00:44:10] But yeah, you know, I, I, I, I talked to people about again, it's I'm not going to compare
[00:44:16] anything to what we're talking about here, but in the military, for instance, a lot of
[00:44:21] times I had to make decisions to, to, to, you know, I got to do something that maybe
[00:44:27] I didn't fully agree with, but I knew in the long run, it was going to get me something
[00:44:32] that it was going to be beneficial to my team or to my platoon or whatever.
[00:44:36] Yeah.
[00:44:37] So you make those little adjustments and you got to suck it up and you do something that
[00:44:40] you might not want to do, but in the long run, it's going to be beneficial.
[00:44:44] Yeah.
[00:44:45] I mean, this, I, I don't even know if this is even a remotely close comparison.
[00:44:50] But what I am saying is this, you take a human being and you say, look, you can either
[00:44:55] step up and act a different way and be abusive to these people or you're going to be dead
[00:45:00] in three days.
[00:45:01] That's it.
[00:45:02] Those are your choices.
[00:45:03] Yeah.
[00:45:04] And it's not that hard to figure out that a lot of people are going to step up and say,
[00:45:07] cool, all of you, those people because I need to live, need to live.
[00:45:11] Yeah.
[00:45:12] My choices either death.
[00:45:13] Yeah.
[00:45:14] And by the way, maybe the, maybe the the best person in that group is going to say, you
[00:45:19] know what, I'm going to do this and I'm going to step up and when I abuse these people,
[00:45:24] I'm going to do a little bit less than someone else might.
[00:45:26] And therefore, I'm doing the best I can.
[00:45:28] Yeah.
[00:45:29] I mean, these are decisions.
[00:45:31] How do you even think about these decisions?
[00:45:33] Yeah.
[00:45:34] No, man.
[00:45:35] And you have to think about it.
[00:45:36] You have to understand, you have to understand what human nature is that there is a survival
[00:45:40] point for humans.
[00:45:42] You have an instinct to survive that very few people can overcome.
[00:45:46] Yeah.
[00:45:48] And I don't even, you know, again, how do you judge whether it's right to overcome it or not?
[00:45:54] When is it right?
[00:45:55] I mean, obviously, when is it right?
[00:45:57] We're sitting here.
[00:45:58] You say, hey, don't, you know, these guys, why would you kill yourself?
[00:46:01] Well, if you don't do these things, you're basically killing yourself.
[00:46:05] If you don't step up, if you don't say, okay, I'll work as a capo.
[00:46:10] If you don't do that, you're killing yourself.
[00:46:11] Right.
[00:46:12] Is that make it okay?
[00:46:13] Man.
[00:46:14] Yeah.
[00:46:15] It's brutal.
[00:46:16] It's like you got to figure out whether or not you're better off dead in the, even in the grand scheme
[00:46:19] of things.
[00:46:20] Like these, these people that they're going to kind of succumb to these positions or do all these
[00:46:25] low things to survive, so they can survive and you don't live on and all this stuff.
[00:46:31] So it's either that or am I better off dead overall.
[00:46:35] You know, like that's the decision you got to make.
[00:46:37] Tank.
[00:46:38] Who knows what you think, especially with all these conditions?
[00:46:42] Yeah.
[00:46:43] You know, the opposite of that was Dick Winners was talking about how he had, and I don't
[00:46:46] know if I talked about it on the podcast, but in the book conversations with Dick Winners,
[00:46:52] you go through a big section where he talks about some of the guys and his
[00:46:55] company.
[00:46:56] And he called him the killers and he actually went on and said, hey, you know, I don't
[00:47:00] want to call him killers because that's going to give the wrong impression.
[00:47:04] But these guys were my most aggressive guys.
[00:47:07] They were my best guys.
[00:47:09] And he said, they didn't make it past.
[00:47:12] You know, he said, most of them didn't make it.
[00:47:13] I forget which, which battle, but he said, most of them didn't make it past this certain
[00:47:18] time because they were so aggressive.
[00:47:20] They were such good guys. They were so brave that they didn't make it.
[00:47:27] And this is sort of the opposite where you have the people that are brave.
[00:47:31] I guess no, it's the same in that people that are brave and going to hold their values.
[00:47:34] They're going to die.
[00:47:35] Right.
[00:47:36] And if you think about somebody that's cowardly in combat, that says, oh, you know, what,
[00:47:42] you know, echo you go first.
[00:47:43] I'm going to sit over here behind this, you know, covered position.
[00:47:47] Yeah.
[00:47:48] And it's a micro example of what we're talking about here.
[00:47:53] Yeah.
[00:47:54] Yeah.
[00:47:55] And this, this, given the book in what we're talking about, it might come off as borderline
[00:48:01] insulting, if not full fledged insulting.
[00:48:04] But you ever watched this show survivor?
[00:48:06] I, I, I, I was the first one when it was kind of a thing.
[00:48:09] Yeah.
[00:48:10] And it was an interesting psychology happening.
[00:48:12] Yeah.
[00:48:13] And that's like a lot of this Rudy Bosch was on it.
[00:48:15] You know, this, see, retired seal map.
[00:48:18] Yeah.
[00:48:19] And it's like, you know, everyone kind of knew in the seal teams.
[00:48:21] Okay.
[00:48:22] Yeah.
[00:48:23] So, especially when you're going to say is that the, the people that are not good human
[00:48:27] beings are the ones that went a lot.
[00:48:29] Well, they get far put it that way because they have this weird mechanism at the end,
[00:48:33] where the last, you know, few people who get voted off, they become this sort of a jury.
[00:48:38] So it's like if you went through the whole game, screwing people over, the jury's going
[00:48:41] to get you kind of thing.
[00:48:43] So it's a, yeah.
[00:48:44] And this is just how the show just sorted itself out over time.
[00:48:48] But the first ones didn't have any jury, right?
[00:48:49] I don't, I don't know.
[00:48:50] I don't know.
[00:48:51] I don't know.
[00:48:52] I'm going to go ahead and say, I'm almost positive they didn't because Rudy had his
[00:48:57] hand on some log and they had to keep it there for like X and for a whole time.
[00:49:01] And one person, you know, he actually, he like fought us on something else and took his
[00:49:05] hand off and then he was out.
[00:49:06] That was it.
[00:49:07] Okay.
[00:49:08] But yeah, there's absolute comparison there.
[00:49:10] There's an absolute comparison to, you know, if you're willing to be a snake, right,
[00:49:17] you can, and you can, you can win the game.
[00:49:20] And I've talked about that to in promotion.
[00:49:22] People getting promoted.
[00:49:23] And if you're willing to be a snake, you can get promoted.
[00:49:27] But the thing that I will say in a work environment is that that snake might get one
[00:49:32] promotion.
[00:49:33] They might get two promotions.
[00:49:35] They're not going to go to the distance.
[00:49:36] And if you hold the line on doing what's correct, then you might miss that first
[00:49:43] promotion.
[00:49:44] You might even miss that second promotion.
[00:49:45] And eventually, if you're on the right path, you will get the recognition and you will
[00:49:50] win in the long run.
[00:49:51] You've got to be patient though.
[00:49:52] Yeah.
[00:49:53] Yeah.
[00:49:54] I mean, obviously in your job, it's not life or death.
[00:49:58] You know, death isn't so close that, you know, one slip up your death.
[00:50:01] You're dead.
[00:50:02] So that's, you know, obviously the dynamics are different in work in that way.
[00:50:06] But otherwise, I think so.
[00:50:08] And survivor, there's also that other thing that kind of, what they talked about where or
[00:50:12] what you're just talking about is.
[00:50:14] If you, it's kind of, in a matter of speaking, playing at safe where you're just hiding
[00:50:19] under the wing, you might attach yourself to someone or you'll avoid any kind of, you
[00:50:25] know, risky, persuasion, and so in survivor, you can make it far like that as well.
[00:50:32] And nowadays, everyone knows about those things.
[00:50:34] Like, oh, you backstabbed everyone.
[00:50:35] Or you just hid behind this guy because he's strong by the same time, just like how you're
[00:50:40] saying, if you're brave or you're going to stick to your morals and be honest with everyone,
[00:50:44] you'll get voted off real quick.
[00:50:45] Even if you're really good at, you know, the challenges, but don't even really good leaders
[00:50:50] get voted.
[00:50:51] Like if someone just does a dynamic, they go to the office.
[00:50:53] That would be right.
[00:50:54] Yeah, yeah, see you later.
[00:50:55] Too much of a threat to everybody else.
[00:50:57] And actually what you're talking about going through seal training, I would hear it.
[00:51:00] And it was, I didn't hear it when I went through.
[00:51:02] But I heard it later, this idea of the gray man.
[00:51:05] And I think we might have actually answered a question on the podcast about that was going
[00:51:08] through training and just being a gray man, meaning just don't stand out.
[00:51:11] Right.
[00:51:12] That's the other.
[00:51:13] And you'll be good to go.
[00:51:15] And that's a strategy.
[00:51:18] That's a strategy.
[00:51:19] Right.
[00:51:20] And the seal team is a strategy going through buds through seal training, the initial seal
[00:51:24] training course.
[00:51:25] Because the many you stand out, people start knowing who you are.
[00:51:28] And now you got instructors looking at you and the more they watch you, the more they can
[00:51:31] see, maybe you're making some mistakes or maybe you're not doing everything right or maybe
[00:51:35] you're not.
[00:51:36] And so it's better just to be that guy in the middle.
[00:51:38] I was the guy in the middle, not because I wanted to be.
[00:51:41] Because I was not, you know, the fastest runner I wasn't the best runner.
[00:51:46] What you don't want to be is the guy on the tail end.
[00:51:48] Right.
[00:51:49] And it's weird because I put so many guys not through the basic seal training, but through
[00:51:52] the advanced seal training.
[00:51:54] And the guys that I remember, there's two types of guys that I remember, the guys that
[00:51:57] were awesome and the guys that were horrible.
[00:51:59] And the guys in the middle, all the gray guys, I know them when I see them, but a lot
[00:52:02] of times I know 100%.
[00:52:04] I might not know their name.
[00:52:06] Whereas some of the pipeters, the young pipeters, some E5 pipeter that was just getting
[00:52:10] after it.
[00:52:11] I always remember those guys names because they would take control of everything.
[00:52:13] And they'd stand out.
[00:52:14] And then the other guys you remember, a guy that are totally jacked up.
[00:52:18] So that idea of being a gray man, it seems like a good policy to have in the concentration
[00:52:23] cap.
[00:52:24] Look, I just don't want to stand out.
[00:52:25] I don't want to have a limp.
[00:52:26] I don't want to, you know, come across as I just want to fit in in the gray man.
[00:52:31] Unless you're going to go the distance, right?
[00:52:35] Which is, and that's a horrible way of saying, I'm going to stand out by saying, hey,
[00:52:39] I can whip these prisoners into shape.
[00:52:42] That's going and raising your hand and saying, I'll be a capo.
[00:52:45] I'm going to step up and what you're risking there is we don't know where this war is
[00:52:50] going to end and where you're going to be at the end of this thing.
[00:52:53] And I read some stories about that.
[00:52:55] The war didn't.
[00:52:57] And they did liberate these camps.
[00:52:59] And it didn't work out.
[00:53:00] Good for the capos.
[00:53:04] So there's the same thing.
[00:53:06] You might have done all right, getting your promotion the first couple of times, but eventually
[00:53:11] it comes around.
[00:53:12] Yeah, exactly right.
[00:53:15] You know, hardly flanagan was talking about karma.
[00:53:17] And I don't know how much reality there is to that.
[00:53:20] But there's the reality of you reap what you sow.
[00:53:24] Yeah.
[00:53:25] And if you treat people, if you take advantage of your position, if you maneuver and
[00:53:29] screw people over to get ahead of them, they'll remember that.
[00:53:32] Yeah.
[00:53:33] They'll remember that.
[00:53:34] Yeah.
[00:53:35] And karma with you.
[00:53:36] And it's never worth it, by the way.
[00:53:39] It's almost never worth it.
[00:53:41] I mean, could you possibly come up with some scenario where, you know, I did this to get
[00:53:47] a promotion.
[00:53:48] So that I could take care of you and everyone else.
[00:53:49] You could come up with this.
[00:53:50] Yeah, but it's very, very rare.
[00:53:52] And my gut feeling was always like it's not worth it.
[00:53:57] It's not worth it to do those little maneuvers and try and better your position on other
[00:54:03] people's backs.
[00:54:04] Yeah.
[00:54:05] We're screwing someone over in.
[00:54:06] Because you've got to live with that too.
[00:54:07] I mean, unless you're like a sociopath or something like that, you have to live with
[00:54:11] that.
[00:54:12] And man, yeah.
[00:54:14] And even at the time, it seems like, oh, I could live with that.
[00:54:17] Cause, oh, look at what?
[00:54:18] You're actually, you're actually taking a higher road than me.
[00:54:21] Because you're saying you personally have to live with it.
[00:54:23] And that's definitely, I'm saying beyond that, even if you're a person that can live with
[00:54:26] it, you're still going to pay in a long run.
[00:54:29] Even if you look yourself in the mirror, but like, I don't care, I got promoted.
[00:54:31] It's good.
[00:54:32] That's, that's, okay.
[00:54:33] So you can live with that.
[00:54:34] That's cool.
[00:54:35] But guess what, there's something else you're going to, that's going to come back around.
[00:54:38] And that is one of those other people that you stepped on their back is going to invent
[00:54:43] something new at work.
[00:54:44] And he's going to take over the division and you're going to pay.
[00:54:46] Not to mention the 10 people who watched it happen.
[00:54:48] Yeah.
[00:54:49] You know, yeah.
[00:54:50] You're just making enemies.
[00:54:51] Yeah.
[00:54:52] enemies.
[00:54:53] And that's really what Karma is for.
[00:54:55] I mean, karma could be this mystical thing that personally watches you and has this
[00:54:59] judgment system.
[00:55:00] But you can just be real.
[00:55:02] Just real life.
[00:55:03] So walk up to, you know, even mean you're even.
[00:55:05] We don't know each other.
[00:55:06] I don't have any bad or good feelings towards you.
[00:55:08] And I come and I slap you.
[00:55:10] I created a deficit now.
[00:55:12] Now you're in 10.
[00:55:13] You're right.
[00:55:14] Big deficit.
[00:55:15] Yeah.
[00:55:16] So you're intention, whether you do it or not, you're, what you, you're compelled
[00:55:21] to slap me back if not more.
[00:55:23] Usually more.
[00:55:24] Yeah.
[00:55:25] Because, you know, so that's kind of really what it is.
[00:55:26] I mean, really in a small teeny tiny nutshell.
[00:55:28] Yeah.
[00:55:29] I go out and start acting mad to everyone.
[00:55:32] They're not going to be like, oh, I love you.
[00:55:34] I mean, they might be, you know, intellectual or, you know, they might be
[00:55:37] able to think about it.
[00:55:38] But their natural compulsion will be to be mad at you back.
[00:55:42] And this, you know, the podcast, human nature, talking about human nature.
[00:55:47] And I always say that war reveals human nature more clearly than anything else.
[00:55:52] Because it's so much pressure on the people.
[00:55:55] Obviously a concentration camp, it's revealing human nature.
[00:55:58] And that's exactly what we're talking about.
[00:56:00] And it reveals itself in crystal clarity on a massive scale in terms of being able to
[00:56:07] see it in a concentration camp.
[00:56:09] And you see it reveal itself on a TV show called survivor.
[00:56:13] And you see it reveal itself in the work environment.
[00:56:16] And what I'm saying is, from all that, what you want to do is you want to make sure that
[00:56:22] when you get put into a position of authority, you don't abuse it.
[00:56:26] That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:27] You don't want to abuse it. You want to treat people with respect no matter what.
[00:56:33] And you don't want to step on people's backs to get ahead because ultimately it's not
[00:56:38] going to pay off.
[00:56:39] It really isn't.
[00:56:40] Yeah.
[00:56:41] You're only going to fool.
[00:56:43] Like that leader that you, that you fooled and thinking that you are a great guy.
[00:56:47] That's only going to last for so long.
[00:56:49] And eventually you're going to get found out.
[00:56:53] Now, all right, let's get back into the book here.
[00:57:01] The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.
[00:57:07] And this is we've talked about the capitals and he's going to talk about some of the
[00:57:09] more heroic people and some of those actions very briefly.
[00:57:14] And he says because it's the reason there's very briefly because there wasn't a lot of them.
[00:57:20] The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.
[00:57:23] There were enough examples often of a heroic nature which proved that apathy could be overcome
[00:57:30] irritability, irritability suppressed.
[00:57:34] Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom.
[00:57:39] Of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.
[00:57:47] We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts, comforting
[00:57:54] others, giving away their last piece of bread.
[00:57:59] They may have been few and number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken
[00:58:06] from a man but one thing.
[00:58:09] The last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances
[00:58:18] to choose one's own way.
[00:58:22] And there it is.
[00:58:23] I mean that is it.
[00:58:26] That is it.
[00:58:27] This idea and captain plumb talked about it as well and captain plumb had a quote from Stockdale.
[00:58:36] We got to explore this and I've got a bunch of stockdale books and we will get to some
[00:58:40] stockdale books.
[00:58:41] Who is the senior guy in the Hanau Hillton and he's a fighter pilot philosopher guy, brilliant
[00:58:49] guy in the hero.
[00:58:50] One was awarded the Medal of Honor and one of the things that Captain Plumb was talking
[00:58:56] to us about is Captain Plumb said that they got word from Stockdale and I'm going to misquote
[00:59:02] it by I'm going to do my best.
[00:59:04] It was just because we're in a prison camp doesn't mean we have to be on defense.
[00:59:10] We're going to be on offense.
[00:59:11] In a prison camp, that's just a completely different attitude.
[00:59:17] It's choosing the attitude.
[00:59:18] We're not going to sit here and be abused and be put down.
[00:59:23] We're going to step up.
[00:59:25] We're going to go on offense and they did.
[00:59:27] They did hunger strikes.
[00:59:28] They passed word around.
[00:59:29] They wouldn't stand up when people entered.
[00:59:31] They did these things.
[00:59:35] They went on offense.
[00:59:38] Human freedom to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.
[00:59:44] We always have that choice.
[00:59:47] No matter what the circumstances are that it's around you, always have that choice.
[00:59:55] Back to the book and there will always choices to make.
[00:59:59] Every day, every hour offered the opportunity to make a decision.
[01:00:03] A decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which
[01:00:09] threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom.
[01:00:15] Which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance.
[01:00:21] Conceying freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.
[01:00:28] Again, there it is.
[01:00:36] You're in a concentration camp, doomed, doomed.
[01:00:42] And yet you can hang on to that last bastion of freedom in your soul.
[01:00:48] To not let them win and not let them own that.
[01:00:57] Back to the book, seen from this point of view the mental reactions of the inmates of
[01:01:01] a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical
[01:01:06] and sociological conditions.
[01:01:09] Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses
[01:01:14] may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis,
[01:01:20] it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of inner
[01:01:27] decision and not the result of camp influences alone.
[01:01:36] Think about that.
[01:01:40] The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision.
[01:01:46] Not the result of the circumstances here and that doesn't matter what kind of person you
[01:01:49] become.
[01:01:50] What matters is the decisions that you make.
[01:01:58] Unbelievable.
[01:02:02] Back to the book, fundamentally, therefore any man can, even under such circumstances, decide
[01:02:09] what shall become of him mentally and spiritually.
[01:02:13] Okay, physically, you can have that one.
[01:02:14] Can't control that all the time, but mentally and spiritually, I get to decide what I'm going to be.
[01:02:26] He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.
[01:02:33] Thus the Fsky said, once there is only one thing that I dread not to be worthy of my sufferings.
[01:02:43] These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs
[01:02:48] who's behavior in camp, who's suffering and death bore witness to the fact that the last
[01:02:56] inner freedom cannot be lost.
[01:03:01] It can be said that they will worthy of their sufferings.
[01:03:07] The way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement.
[01:03:14] It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away that makes life meaningful and
[01:03:22] purposeful.
[01:03:28] The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which
[01:03:34] he takes up his cross gives him ample opportunity, even under the most difficult circumstances
[01:03:40] to add a deeper meaning to his life.
[01:03:44] It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation,
[01:03:53] he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.
[01:03:59] Heurlies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forego the opportunities of
[01:04:04] attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him.
[01:04:12] And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
[01:04:18] So think about that, when you get faced with this ultimate challenge, brutal challenge,
[01:04:26] when life is just about to crush you, that's when you have the biggest opportunity to
[01:04:34] prove who you are.
[01:04:38] Speaking of unworthy topics, but this is something I, when I was, when I first got to see
[01:04:47] what was at Silti-Mond, I ran a communications class.
[01:04:52] When I ran the class, I was super hard.
[01:04:56] I know it comes as a big shocker.
[01:04:57] But we would test, test, test on all these different subjects.
[01:05:02] What radio, what frequency you ran with, what all these different subjects.
[01:05:09] I would say the guys, hey, tomorrow we got another test, another opportunity for you to
[01:05:13] prove yourself.
[01:05:15] That's the way I looked at it.
[01:05:17] They didn't always look at it the same way.
[01:05:18] But that's exactly what he's saying here.
[01:05:21] When you have these brutal circumstances that you face, that's your opportunity.
[01:05:28] And if you think about all heroic tales, right?
[01:05:31] There's no heroic tales where the hero doesn't face any challenges.
[01:05:35] And as a matter of fact, the worst challenge is that he faces the more of a hero he becomes.
[01:05:39] If he rises to the occasion, if he doesn't rise to the occasion, guess what?
[01:05:42] We don't hear about it.
[01:05:43] Not a hero.
[01:05:47] In fact, let's say you're considered a hero.
[01:05:52] And then this big chance to prove yourself comes about and you fail or you don't step up,
[01:06:00] you're kind of like this big failure in a way.
[01:06:02] Even though you've been a hero the whole time.
[01:06:04] Yeah, I would say that's true.
[01:06:07] Although if you do something heroic enough, people are like good with it.
[01:06:12] I think.
[01:06:13] If they're significant enough, it's kind of the same thing.
[01:06:17] I mean, the bottom line is you face these challenges and you get challenged to have this attitude
[01:06:24] of basically good opportunity to solve the problems.
[01:06:30] Oh, big challenge, cool opportunity.
[01:06:32] Good.
[01:06:33] Yes, like those guys who, they start a business, the business is like,
[01:06:37] grows and then it just massively fails because of some mistake or I don't know something.
[01:06:42] Or the kind of out in a whatever.
[01:06:44] And then they reach, rock bottom and they build themselves back up and then it's this massive
[01:06:49] success.
[01:06:50] That's such an impressive story.
[01:06:52] Yeah, you know, that's much better than hey, I went to this school.
[01:06:56] I graduated.
[01:06:57] I worked this job.
[01:06:58] I made a bunch of money.
[01:06:59] Yeah.
[01:07:00] Everyone goes on cool.
[01:07:01] Right?
[01:07:02] Cool.
[01:07:03] Yeah, cool.
[01:07:04] They want to hear the struggle.
[01:07:05] They want to see that you were challenged.
[01:07:07] Yep.
[01:07:08] Back to the book, everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving
[01:07:17] something through his own suffering.
[01:07:19] God, think about that.
[01:07:21] The suffering that you're going through is an a chance to achieve something through your
[01:07:29] suffering.
[01:07:30] That's an incredible thought.
[01:07:32] Yeah.
[01:07:33] That's an incredible thought.
[01:07:36] Now, this next part is something that I get asked about on a fairly regular basis.
[01:07:43] Back to the book, take the fate of the sick, especially those who are incurable.
[01:07:50] I once read a letter written by young invalid in which he told a friend that he had just
[01:07:55] found out he would not live for long.
[01:07:57] That even an operation would be of no help.
[01:08:00] He wrote further that he remembered a film he had seen in which a man was portrayed
[01:08:05] who waited for death and encouraged and dignified way.
[01:08:11] The boy had a thought.
[01:08:13] The boy had thought it had great accomplishment to meet death so well.
[01:08:18] Now he wrote, fate was offering him a similar chance.
[01:08:25] Yeah.
[01:08:26] I mean, there's, there's, you know, diseases, terminal diseases.
[01:08:35] And that's it.
[01:08:37] And then what do you do?
[01:08:39] Well, I think you have to choose the best possible attitude you can.
[01:08:45] And again, I've never been in that situation, obviously.
[01:08:49] But that statement seems to be the best possible attitude to take.
[01:09:00] Again, that's when we see people doing something heroic.
[01:09:04] That's what we see.
[01:09:05] I know it's funny some of those when we were doing a lot of the Native Americans on
[01:09:10] the podcast.
[01:09:11] They all had that attitude.
[01:09:12] When you go to face death, hold your head high.
[01:09:16] Be afraid of it.
[01:09:19] And that's really, like you said, it's an easier sitting here in the recording studio.
[01:09:24] And of course, easy for me to sit here and say that.
[01:09:29] But that's a hard one.
[01:09:30] You know, the other day on the Jill Rogan podcast, Everlast was on there.
[01:09:39] And Jill Rogan, you know, Everlast was saying, hey, you know, I'm not in good shape right
[01:09:45] now.
[01:09:46] I wish I could better shape, but I have, you know, bad.
[01:09:47] I think he's got a back injury.
[01:09:49] And he's got this and he's got a daughter that's got some kind of illness, bad illness.
[01:09:53] And Joe put on the good video that you made.
[01:09:57] And you know, Everlast, when he got done, Everlast was like, hey, that's cool.
[01:10:01] That's inspirational.
[01:10:02] But how does that help me with my sick daughter?
[01:10:04] Yeah.
[01:10:05] What's good about that?
[01:10:06] You know?
[01:10:07] And I wish I could have jumped through and talked to him because this much I will say, when
[01:10:14] you got a bad situation like that, I'm telling you right now, it could be worse.
[01:10:20] Absolutely a hundred percent.
[01:10:23] And the fact that he's talking about his daughter and how she's sick and how he has
[01:10:26] to spend so much time with her to take care of her, well, well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:30] Yeah.
[01:10:31] Be thankful that you're in a position in life where you can spend time with her.
[01:10:33] Be thankful that she's in a condition where she can spend time with you.
[01:10:37] Yeah.
[01:10:38] And you know, there's, she's still here.
[01:10:41] If nothing else, that's good.
[01:10:43] If nothing else.
[01:10:45] And so what are you going to do?
[01:10:46] I mean, your, your other option is to say my daughter sick.
[01:10:50] This is horrible.
[01:10:51] I got cursed.
[01:10:52] It's, it's not fair.
[01:10:54] And what does that do for you?
[01:10:55] Where does that get you?
[01:10:56] It doesn't get you anywhere.
[01:10:58] It matter fact that takes you backwards.
[01:11:00] Yeah.
[01:11:01] So you really truly do have to look at these horrible situations.
[01:11:05] I remember, I got a call back from from overseas that a guy was a seal was really
[01:11:14] badly wounded.
[01:11:16] And a couple of my friends were kind of distraught.
[01:11:22] And I talked to one of the guys overseas.
[01:11:25] And I, you know, and, and man, I, at this point, you know, lost Mark, lost Mikey.
[01:11:33] I don't think Ryan had died yet.
[01:11:34] But like I was familiar with guys dying.
[01:11:39] Yeah.
[01:11:40] And I talked to one of the guys that was overseas.
[01:11:43] And they said, hey, you know, this guy is really, really messed up.
[01:11:46] And I'm like, is he going to live?
[01:11:49] And they're like, yeah, he's stable.
[01:11:51] And I go then don't worry about a thing.
[01:11:54] Be happy.
[01:11:55] He's alive.
[01:11:56] And it doesn't matter if he's missing a leg or two legs or whatever, he's going
[01:12:02] to be coming home.
[01:12:04] And he's going to carry on with his life.
[01:12:06] And it's going to be hard.
[01:12:07] And it's going to be hell.
[01:12:08] And it's going to be a challenge.
[01:12:10] But guess what?
[01:12:11] He's going to be here.
[01:12:13] Yeah.
[01:12:14] And that, you know, again, it's like, man, what's the alternative?
[01:12:18] The alternative is he's dead.
[01:12:20] The alternative is we never talk to him again.
[01:12:22] That's the alternative.
[01:12:24] Yeah.
[01:12:25] He's going to come back.
[01:12:26] Right?
[01:12:27] And this guy, the guy that got wounded, he wasn't like a great friend of mine.
[01:12:31] But I knew us talking to people that were very close to him.
[01:12:34] And so, you know, I had to make sure I wasn't coming across like, hey, it's no big deal.
[01:12:39] I, you know, look, he's going to be fine.
[01:12:41] No, it wasn't like that.
[01:12:42] But look, look what the alternative is.
[01:12:44] You know, let's be thankful that he's alive.
[01:12:47] Yeah.
[01:12:48] And he's going to come home.
[01:12:49] And we're, you know, he's going to carry on with his life.
[01:12:52] And that's what's important.
[01:12:53] So it's really when you do look at these situations, when things are going bad.
[01:12:59] And then you say, okay, well, good.
[01:13:00] Come with that.
[01:13:01] And then the one step further is then what happens when someone does die?
[01:13:05] Then what good comes of that?
[01:13:06] And my thought is always the same thing.
[01:13:09] I'm thankful that I got to know that person.
[01:13:12] I'm thankful that I got to understand their personality.
[01:13:16] I'm thankful that I got to spend a day with them laughing and having that memory.
[01:13:22] Yeah.
[01:13:23] So, what's good is I got to experience them in my life and they got to experience other
[01:13:27] people's in their lives.
[01:13:28] And that's what's good about it.
[01:13:31] But just to say, hey, you know, my friend, my family member is dead.
[01:13:38] This is horrible.
[01:13:39] And I can't escape from this.
[01:13:41] Wrong attitude.
[01:13:42] And of course, you're going to go through that.
[01:13:44] It's the, there's the, whatever those things are that you go through.
[01:13:47] It's shock.
[01:13:48] And then denial.
[01:13:49] And then anger and then acceptance and all that.
[01:13:53] That's I get it.
[01:13:54] And it's not going to be easy.
[01:13:56] But I'll tell you what will make it easier is to look at the situation and say, what
[01:14:02] here is good.
[01:14:04] You know, and you, one of the worst things is parents without have young children that
[01:14:09] are terminally ill.
[01:14:10] It's awful.
[01:14:12] It's awful.
[01:14:13] And the best you can think of is say, hold them while you can.
[01:14:18] Right?
[01:14:19] And get what you can and grow the memories that you can right now.
[01:14:23] Because just to focus on the fact that life isn't fair isn't going to help you.
[01:14:27] And guess what?
[01:14:28] You're right.
[01:14:29] Life isn't fair.
[01:14:30] Yeah.
[01:14:31] Life isn't fair.
[01:14:32] It's, it's a random, horrible thing.
[01:14:37] And if you want to focus on the randomness and the horribleness of it, that's where you're
[01:14:41] going to end up.
[01:14:43] And if you can focus on the good that comes out of those situations, try to.
[01:14:48] And again, I haven't been through that.
[01:14:50] I haven't been through that.
[01:14:51] Thank God.
[01:14:52] Yeah, not that level.
[01:14:53] But the best I can do, the best I can assess is say, man, at least try and look at what
[01:14:59] positive is coming out of this.
[01:15:01] And focus on that instead of focusing on what is negative, chew.
[01:15:06] It's going back to what Frankl said.
[01:15:08] You choose what you're at if you're just going to be.
[01:15:10] Yeah.
[01:15:11] Don't become a victim of the randomness.
[01:15:14] Yeah.
[01:15:15] And that goes on on all levels.
[01:15:18] You know, even if something isn't horrible, it's just kind of junk.
[01:15:24] All the way down to just something that's pretty horrible.
[01:15:27] There's still a lot of good going on in the situation.
[01:15:30] But in just like, are you saying, like, your attitude or another way to put it is what you're
[01:15:35] looking for to internalize?
[01:15:38] You know, a lot of times I know it's natural.
[01:15:40] And I've been there where it's like, everything just seems bad.
[01:15:43] Even the smut like, if something real bad happens, that you think is real bad.
[01:15:46] And then the same day or the next year, whatever, something small bad happens, it'll just
[01:15:51] add big time to the badness.
[01:15:52] Like, nothing's going right.
[01:15:54] Kind of attitude.
[01:15:55] Meanwhile, all the good things are going on all around you.
[01:15:57] We're not looking for that all those things.
[01:15:58] Yeah.
[01:15:59] So in a lot of times with like, real bad situations, especially with kids, because that's
[01:16:03] like the the most weak you can ever feel really like your kid.
[01:16:07] Like when my daughter had to chew a big staff infection.
[01:16:09] And so in her lymph nodes over neck of the age and the hospital for a week.
[01:16:13] And we're there.
[01:16:15] That's like the most weak in that that you'll feel in, of course, there's way worse situations.
[01:16:20] Yeah.
[01:16:21] And then that's nothing compared to situations.
[01:16:23] I know that.
[01:16:24] But there are good things that are still going on in your situation, your life.
[01:16:30] That's a B. There's good situations that can come of it.
[01:16:34] And a lot of them, a lot of them are strength related.
[01:16:38] You know, like if you let something beat you down and you don't get this strength, like
[01:16:42] that's a loss.
[01:16:43] You'll lose.
[01:16:44] Like you'll, so you're saying you're getting some kind of conditioning from it.
[01:16:48] In a way, in a matter of speaking, yes.
[01:16:51] So like if you have a quote unquote good attitude, when you emerge from the situation,
[01:16:57] you will have strength now.
[01:16:59] If you don't, you won't, you'll have weakness.
[01:17:01] You'll be, you know, gun shy.
[01:17:03] Everything happens bad.
[01:17:04] My life sucks.
[01:17:05] And you know, you'll continue down.
[01:17:07] And then that road.
[01:17:08] So the good part, like if you said, like I said, if you keep that good attitude, and when
[01:17:13] you make it out, you will have the other good things that can come from it.
[01:17:18] You will have the strength.
[01:17:20] Yeah.
[01:17:21] And you're right.
[01:17:22] And I mean, just look at Captain Plum and look at Colonel Reader.
[01:17:25] Anyhow, for those guys to go through what they went through and maintain a positive attitude.
[01:17:30] And then they come out and you talk to those guys and it's like, you can't think of
[01:17:33] more positive people in the world.
[01:17:36] Yeah.
[01:17:37] You know, I mean, not in the whole world, but you, they're just have so much positivity
[01:17:41] because they've been through something and they had to maintain that attitude.
[01:17:44] So you're right when they come out.
[01:17:45] It's like how are you going to make?
[01:17:47] And I think that's what happens a lot of times with guys that have been to war is they
[01:17:52] come back and they're like happy to see the sunrise.
[01:17:54] I know I am.
[01:17:55] I'm happy to see the sunrise.
[01:17:57] I'm happier than a lot of people to see the sunrise.
[01:18:00] I appreciate that thing.
[01:18:01] And I think when people go through some kind of devastating disease in their family or
[01:18:05] themselves, same thing once they get through it, they at least come out the other side and
[01:18:10] they can appreciate it.
[01:18:11] And yet if they let it beat them down, it's going to, it's going to everything is going
[01:18:15] to look down.
[01:18:16] If you're looking down, you're going to look down.
[01:18:17] If you're looking up, you're going to look up.
[01:18:19] Yeah.
[01:18:20] That's got to be a, it's hard.
[01:18:23] I mean, it's so hard for people.
[01:18:24] It's so hard.
[01:18:25] Yeah.
[01:18:26] And again, I'm over here talking, you know.
[01:18:28] Yeah, for sure, both of us are.
[01:18:30] You know, when I was on Joe Rogan, we started off talking about Chris Cornell, it's kill
[01:18:34] himself.
[01:18:35] We kind of cursory kind of talked about depression and neither want to.
[01:18:38] I mean, I definitely am not claiming to be any kind of expert at all about it.
[01:18:44] And I even said on there, I was like, look, I've never felt this way.
[01:18:46] And I had just a couple of people hit me up on social media like, you know, you should
[01:18:49] you should read this or you should do this or and, and, you know, or you're not right.
[01:18:54] And I'm like, no, I wasn't even trying to say anything that I'm right.
[01:18:56] I'm just tell, I was saying, I don't actually even know.
[01:18:59] Yeah.
[01:19:00] And so yeah, I'm not, you know, certainly an expert on how to overcome, you know, horrible
[01:19:07] situations.
[01:19:08] But I've been in some pretty horrible situations.
[01:19:10] And this is what my thoughts tried to be.
[01:19:12] Yeah.
[01:19:13] And it's not always easy at all.
[01:19:15] Yeah.
[01:19:16] Jordan Peterson has some good good, you know, good content on that where he's basically
[01:19:23] in that cell, he says, get yourself together where in his example, one of the many was,
[01:19:28] you know, a family member dies or whatever, get yourself together.
[01:19:31] So, you know, what are you going to do?
[01:19:33] Are you going to wallow with the rest of the people?
[01:19:35] So, no one can get a hold of anything in the funerals of master, whatever, or you
[01:19:39] can get yourself together, grief for sure, get, but get yourself together.
[01:19:42] So, you can kind of lead and get the funeral together and take care of the business or whatever.
[01:19:47] And it's such a cold, blooded thing to say, right?
[01:19:50] It's the complete.
[01:19:51] And that's what I think is hard about it is, you know, think about this.
[01:19:57] Oh, if someone in your family died and I was like, echo, get yourself together.
[01:20:00] Right.
[01:20:01] You know what I mean?
[01:20:02] Who says that?
[01:20:03] But that's probably the best thing I could possibly say to you.
[01:20:05] Yeah.
[01:20:06] I might need to say it in a more tactful way.
[01:20:08] I might just say, hey, I command, I feel for you, hey, man, what we need to do is
[01:20:13] grieve, but we also need to focus on moving forward.
[01:20:15] You know what I mean?
[01:20:16] It's that kind of thing.
[01:20:17] But the reality is, what am I really saying?
[01:20:18] I'm really saying, hey, get yourself together.
[01:20:21] You got to move on.
[01:20:22] We got to move on.
[01:20:23] We got to move forward.
[01:20:24] You got to move forward in your life.
[01:20:26] And that's such a hard thing to say to somebody.
[01:20:28] Yeah.
[01:20:29] But that's probably the right attitude to take.
[01:20:33] Yeah.
[01:20:34] Okay.
[01:20:35] Like, this is horrible.
[01:20:37] And I need to keep it together.
[01:20:38] Yeah.
[01:20:39] Yeah.
[01:20:40] Yeah, man, especially when there's no majorly prevalent things that are at risk
[01:20:48] at that moment as well.
[01:20:49] You know, like, your situation, like, in a combat situation, I think BTF Tony was talking
[01:20:54] about this.
[01:20:55] If you're in a firefight or something like that, and something gets hit, you don't just
[01:20:59] quit.
[01:21:00] No.
[01:21:01] Exit the fire fighting.
[01:21:02] Oh, my gosh, my guy's hit.
[01:21:03] It's like, okay, he's hit.
[01:21:05] Boom.
[01:21:06] Let's continue the firefight.
[01:21:07] But let's say there was no firefight.
[01:21:09] Then the guy gets hit.
[01:21:10] It seems like a harder thing to just move on.
[01:21:14] So what are you talking about?
[01:21:15] Yeah.
[01:21:16] You need to have a firefight going on.
[01:21:18] So that you, so that you can say, okay, I'm going to deal with this.
[01:21:24] But I need to also think about the rest of life.
[01:21:27] Yeah.
[01:21:28] So hard.
[01:21:29] And, you know, again, it's, you know what I'm feeling like right now?
[01:21:32] I got, I get some social media sometimes where someone will say, hey, I'm not a vet.
[01:21:38] But like a friend of mine is going through problems.
[01:21:40] And I don't know how to talk to him because I'm not a vet.
[01:21:41] And that's kind of like what I feel like right now.
[01:21:43] Like I haven't been through those kind of suffering.
[01:21:45] So I'm throwing darts.
[01:21:47] But I'm throwing them based on what I know.
[01:21:49] So it's the best, like, you know, best I could do.
[01:21:52] Yeah.
[01:21:53] You're at risk of someone saying, hey, you simply don't understand.
[01:21:58] And my fact is there.
[01:21:59] Yeah.
[01:22:00] And my statement to that would be, yes, I don't understand.
[01:22:03] You know, it's like in the, when I was talking to veterans saying, look, people, you feel
[01:22:08] like people don't understand?
[01:22:10] They don't.
[01:22:11] And that's okay.
[01:22:12] And so definitely not sitting here saying, oh, you know, I know.
[01:22:15] This is what you're doing in a situation like that.
[01:22:17] No, I don't know.
[01:22:18] Yeah.
[01:22:19] I don't know what you do when your family member suffers something.
[01:22:22] I agree just like that.
[01:22:24] Like a terminal disease or deaf.
[01:22:26] I don't know.
[01:22:27] Haven't been through it.
[01:22:30] What I have been through is losing guys in combat.
[01:22:33] That I have been through.
[01:22:34] This is, this is darkness.
[01:22:37] It's a different kind of darkness.
[01:22:39] But this is what I did in those situations.
[01:22:45] And that's what I would think would help you in these other situations.
[01:22:50] Hard.
[01:22:51] Question, right?
[01:22:52] What do you do?
[01:22:53] Hard.
[01:22:54] And we are sitting here reading a book by a guy that was in a concentration camp.
[01:22:59] And he's saying this thing to do.
[01:23:03] So that's another sort of reinforcement of this thought pattern.
[01:23:13] Yeah.
[01:23:14] All right.
[01:23:17] He talks a little bit about the passage of time here.
[01:23:20] In camp, a small unit of time.
[01:23:24] A day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue appeared endless.
[01:23:30] A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly.
[01:23:35] My comrades agreed when I said that in the camp, a day lasted longer than a week.
[01:23:42] How paradoxical was our time experience.
[01:23:46] And that's something this actually reminded me I was talking to a Sarah Armstrong.
[01:23:50] And well now it's actually around the conversation when life was talking about heat
[01:23:54] come out here and seeing all my kids, my kids are all grown up now.
[01:23:58] Basically, except for my little list one.
[01:24:01] But my oldest daughter's graduate in high school, you know, a couple of weeks and she's
[01:24:04] going to go to college.
[01:24:05] And you know, when life met her, she was, what was that 12 years ago?
[01:24:10] So she was, you know, no, six, something like that.
[01:24:19] So, you know, young and then you came out here, you know, he just come left his apartment
[01:24:24] in New York City where he's got his wife and kids and they're, you know, it's chaos
[01:24:28] and little kids and they're crying and screaming and spilling stuff and throwing up milk
[01:24:32] and pissing everywhere and it's just, you know, that's what life is when you're there.
[01:24:37] And you know, he came out here and saw how my kids were now grown up.
[01:24:41] That time has gone, by the way, gone.
[01:24:43] And get it back.
[01:24:45] And he, you know, he talked about it on the podcast, just name and make sure you appreciate
[01:24:49] those.
[01:24:50] And Sarah Armstrong, you know, said something along the lines of the days are long, but the
[01:24:55] years are short.
[01:24:56] Yeah.
[01:24:57] That's a very true statement.
[01:24:59] And you can, you can see that cured the same thing.
[01:25:02] You know, all of a sudden, this time is just going by so quickly.
[01:25:13] This is starting to talk again back to the attitude.
[01:25:15] We could say that most men in a concentration camp believe that the real opportunities of
[01:25:20] life had passed.
[01:25:22] Yet in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge.
[01:25:26] One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or
[01:25:33] one could ignore the challenges and simply vegetate as did a majority of the prisoners.
[01:25:39] Same thing, same topic.
[01:25:41] I know it's interesting.
[01:25:43] I told you this before we started this book, you know, is a great book.
[01:25:48] But I, I kind of wanted to talk about how bad concentration camps were, and I went and
[01:25:55] found some other sources for that.
[01:25:59] Because Victor Franco doesn't highlight it that much.
[01:26:03] I mean, his ad, I mean, he was in Auschwitz for crying out loud.
[01:26:06] Doesn't get any worse.
[01:26:08] And, you know, to really give the impact of how bad it was, I went and found some other
[01:26:13] sources that were a little bit more directly written and a little bit more horrifying
[01:26:20] to be lack of a better word.
[01:26:22] Because in his accounts, he doesn't go into those, some of those graphic details, which
[01:26:27] I feel like you should know, and you should understand what.
[01:26:30] Before you talk about, hey, he's keeping a good attitude.
[01:26:32] But no, no, it's not he's keeping a good attitude, because he was in a concentration camp,
[01:26:36] but it wasn't that bad.
[01:26:37] No.
[01:26:38] And that's what he's dealing with.
[01:26:40] And in his mind, you could make a triumph or a victory out of those experiences, which
[01:26:47] is incredible attitude to have.
[01:26:51] Going back to the book, the prisoner who had lost faith in the future, his future was
[01:27:01] doomed.
[01:27:03] With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold.
[01:27:07] He let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay.
[01:27:14] Usually this happened quite suddenly in the form of a crisis, the symptoms of which were
[01:27:18] familiar to the experience camp inmate.
[01:27:22] We all feared this moment, not for ourselves, which would have been pointless, but for
[01:27:26] our friends.
[01:27:28] Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one morning to get dressed and wash or to
[01:27:32] go out on the parade grounds.
[01:27:35] No intrudes, no blows, no threats had any effect.
[01:27:39] He just lay there hardly moving.
[01:27:42] If this crisis was brought about by an illness, he refused to be taken to the sick bay or
[01:27:47] do anything to help himself.
[01:27:49] He simply gave up.
[01:27:52] There he remained lying in his own extra, excret a, and nothing bothered him anymore.
[01:28:02] That's similar to what Colonel Riderset, how if you didn't actively stay alive, you
[01:28:09] would die.
[01:28:10] You couldn't just passively exist.
[01:28:13] You weren't going to make it.
[01:28:14] If you wanted to die, all you had to do is stop trying, then you were going to die.
[01:28:20] Back to the book, as we said before, any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in
[01:28:24] the camp had to first succeed in showing him some future goal.
[01:28:30] In Nietzsche's words, he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.
[01:28:43] That could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohyogenic efforts regarding
[01:28:49] prisoners.
[01:28:51] Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why, an aim for their
[01:28:56] lives.
[01:28:57] In order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence, what to him who
[01:29:04] saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point to carrying on.
[01:29:12] He was soon lost.
[01:29:14] Got to know why you're doing what you're doing.
[01:29:18] That's all there is to it.
[01:29:19] He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.
[01:29:26] Obviously, that translates right into a leader's perspective, making sure people understand
[01:29:30] why they're doing what they're doing.
[01:29:31] You just don't part of quarters at him.
[01:29:33] But from an individual perspective, why are you doing this?
[01:29:37] Find that.
[01:29:40] I actually made a post on social media the other day.
[01:29:47] It was something long, a lot of finding your inner why or something like that.
[01:29:53] I was mocking that attitude.
[01:29:58] I was saying sometimes my inner voice is trying to find out why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[01:30:04] When I'm doing something hard, my inner voice doesn't allow to talk.
[01:30:07] Be quiet.
[01:30:08] I'm over here working.
[01:30:12] But there is, obviously, just like a leadership perspective and from a personal perspective,
[01:30:18] why are you doing what you're doing?
[01:30:20] That should be the driving force.
[01:30:23] If you don't have that, it's hard to overcome these challenges.
[01:30:26] You can't just overcome challenges just because they're there.
[01:30:29] You need some greater reason.
[01:30:32] When that gets lost, you get lost.
[01:30:35] I don't know why I thought those were.
[01:30:40] I think the one why you were mocking that, this is my why.
[01:30:45] It wasn't, it wasn't, now that I think about it, it wasn't really the why thing.
[01:30:50] It was more about the inner voice.
[01:30:52] But yeah, I know I definitely said why in the tale.
[01:30:55] Because people do, it's like a lot of good expressions or things or whatever.
[01:31:01] Or people just, oh, I like that and they'll just start throwing it out and abusing it.
[01:31:05] It dumps it down and then everyone's saying it, now it just sort of sounds cheesy because
[01:31:09] no one's actually doing it.
[01:31:11] No one's actually understanding the real what it really means.
[01:31:15] The person who's like, hey, I'm going to lose weight and they've basically spent their life neglecting
[01:31:21] their health or whatever.
[01:31:22] They're like, okay, I'm going to get in shape and then they go on this program.
[01:31:28] They quit, but when they're doing good on the program, let's say the first or second day,
[01:31:32] they'll be like, this is my why and they'll show their dog or something like that.
[01:31:38] My why or my kids or whatever, but then the next day they quit the program.
[01:31:43] It's such a weak thing.
[01:31:44] You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just do that.
[01:31:47] That whole thing, my why.
[01:31:49] Whatever, that's way too powerful for people to just be like, hey, my why and then just not do it.
[01:31:54] It should know just like a little thing.
[01:31:55] You can't just throw a together a 38 second Instagram post that's about you.
[01:32:01] Why.
[01:32:02] That need you need to dig.
[01:32:03] Yeah, you gotta do that stuff.
[01:32:05] So that's why it's funny because like, people just throw that out now.
[01:32:10] Not means like nothing and it's almost like they seem, it seems like it seems like it's
[01:32:15] totally my interpretation of it.
[01:32:17] But it seems like they're saying it and thinking that they sound so profound and deep and
[01:32:22] new and inspirational, you know, but everyone's saying it.
[01:32:26] And to counter your point, I've had plenty of people that have talked to me about, you
[01:32:33] know, I wasn't bad shape.
[01:32:34] I wasn't taking care of myself.
[01:32:36] I wasn't healthy and I had my first kid.
[01:32:40] And I said to myself, I need to be there for my kid or I was doing bad at work and I didn't
[01:32:45] like Aaron, it wasn't focused on that career, it wasn't focused on being squared away and
[01:32:48] I was wasting all my money on dumb stuff and I had my first kid.
[01:32:50] Yeah.
[01:32:51] And then I said, I gotta, you know, this, this is me taking care of my kid and I need to do a
[01:32:55] damn good job.
[01:32:56] And that's exactly the point right there is that it's a real thing.
[01:33:00] And if that's for real, you're, you're why conceptually no.
[01:33:03] I'm just in the expression for sure.
[01:33:05] For sure, but there's a big difference between, well, there's a big difference between
[01:33:09] between the contemplation that goes into.
[01:33:11] I'm doing this for my kid.
[01:33:12] It's cool.
[01:33:13] I'm going to go on weight watchers.
[01:33:14] Right?
[01:33:15] It's like, um, no, like think about this.
[01:33:18] Think about your relationship with your children and where you're going to end up and
[01:33:22] now you want to see them live and what guidance you can give them as human beings.
[01:33:25] And the example that you're sending for them and you line all those things up, then
[01:33:29] maybe you can put down the donuts.
[01:33:31] Yeah, you're not clear it.
[01:33:33] In other words, you gotta do it.
[01:33:34] Yeah.
[01:33:35] Actually, you know, so yeah, that's why it just sounds cheesy because everyone does it.
[01:33:38] It says it.
[01:33:40] This is a great section going back to the book.
[01:33:43] We had to learn ourselves and furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men that it
[01:33:49] did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.
[01:33:59] We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life and instead to think of ourselves as
[01:34:04] those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly.
[01:34:10] One answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct.
[01:34:19] Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems
[01:34:25] and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
[01:34:30] Again, you're turning, you're flipping this idea around.
[01:34:34] It's not about what I want from life.
[01:34:37] It's what what is life want from me.
[01:34:39] And it's putting these challenges and these hurdles in front of me and I gotta go and jump
[01:34:43] over them.
[01:34:44] And then I got a smash them and then I got to set fire to them and then I got to use that
[01:34:48] fire to fuel the domination of everything that's in my path.
[01:34:54] That kind of like, hey, these weights aren't going to lift themselves.
[01:34:57] It's the exact same thing.
[01:34:58] It's the exact same thing.
[01:35:01] Yeah.
[01:35:06] And again, going back to this idea that war reveals human nature and this is Dr. Frankl's
[01:35:16] way of putting this exact same thing that I say back to the book, Life and a concentration
[01:35:21] camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths.
[01:35:27] It is, is it surprising that in those depths, we again found only human qualities which
[01:35:35] in their very nature were a mixture of good and evil.
[01:35:42] The rift dividing good from evil which goes through all human beings reaches into the
[01:35:47] lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by
[01:35:54] the concentration camp.
[01:36:00] So we've got this idea once again that there's a dichotomy.
[01:36:04] In people, in people, this dichotomy that you're capable of doing extreme good and you're
[01:36:13] capable of doing extreme evil.
[01:36:15] And we've seen it a bunch, we've seen it a bunch on this podcast.
[01:36:22] You look at the mele i'masicker.
[01:36:24] Those guys were normal guys that committed extreme evil straight up evil.
[01:36:34] Normal guys that were, you know, four days earlier probably would have done something
[01:36:41] heroic to save someone.
[01:36:44] And here they are the other end of the spectrum.
[01:36:49] And I think that you have to, we have to face that not only individually do you have that,
[01:36:56] but then obviously as the group you have that, as a group of human beings, we have that
[01:37:00] capability.
[01:37:01] We've seen it over and over again.
[01:37:02] If you want to know what that good part is, you got to know what that darkness is
[01:37:05] to.
[01:37:06] Yeah, the group thing is interesting.
[01:37:11] You know, you know, you always hear not always, but you hear sometimes about these riots
[01:37:15] on college campuses, whether it be after a game or something like that.
[01:37:20] But at a glance, you think dang is this college full of just whole guns?
[01:37:25] Like if this bit like you dry it, you know, but it's that.
[01:37:29] It's like as an individual or, you know, under a quote unquote normal circumstances,
[01:37:33] they just, they're just normal people.
[01:37:35] You know, guys girls, whatever, they're just normal people.
[01:37:38] But then you put them in this particular situation in some way extreme or whatever, you know,
[01:37:43] it's a spectrum.
[01:37:44] But, and they just act different.
[01:37:46] And the whole group dynamic to this act different.
[01:37:49] The group dynamic is a, is it can be a very, very scary thing.
[01:37:54] There's no doubt it can be a very, very scary thing.
[01:37:58] And that's why, you know, even when he's talking about, and I mentioned this on when
[01:38:02] I was on Joe Rogan's last podcast and this idea of individual freedom and acting as an individual
[01:38:08] is so important as to structure your life around to say, look, I'm not part of this group.
[01:38:16] Your group is not me.
[01:38:17] Yeah.
[01:38:18] This group is not me.
[01:38:19] They don't represent me.
[01:38:21] I represent me.
[01:38:22] Exactly.
[01:38:23] And I have my own individual choices.
[01:38:26] And that's what he's saying in here, the minute you give away to the herd, that's when
[01:38:31] you start going, you don't know, you're, you don't longer control it.
[01:38:34] Yeah.
[01:38:35] And when you give up that control, that's a scary, scary thing.
[01:38:37] And that's when these evil things take place.
[01:38:39] Yeah.
[01:38:40] And that, once again, it's, it's like, it's easy to say now.
[01:38:45] Because grouping yourself is actually a survival mechanism.
[01:38:49] True.
[01:38:50] So you, you know, it's not going to be just that you're not going to naturally just be an
[01:38:53] individual and act like an individual and conduct yourself in all these extreme situations
[01:38:58] as an individual.
[01:38:59] You're not just going to naturally do that.
[01:39:01] True.
[01:39:02] So I guess it just helps to know these things.
[01:39:05] Well, that's, you're, you're a hundred percent right on both facets.
[01:39:09] Number one, yes.
[01:39:10] Grouping and fitting in is a survival instinct that people have.
[01:39:15] And that's why trends happen.
[01:39:17] And that's why nations happen.
[01:39:19] And that's why that's why groups occur in people.
[01:39:23] And politics.
[01:39:24] Yeah, politics and everything, right?
[01:39:27] The, these groups.
[01:39:28] And I mean, it's weird now because with the internet, you can have groups.
[01:39:31] You can be part of these groups.
[01:39:32] Yeah.
[01:39:33] But honestly, yeah, whatever group you want.
[01:39:35] And you can connect with all these different people.
[01:39:37] But it's also important to make sure that you do remember that you are an individual.
[01:39:45] Man, you can't, that you don't want to give up that last shred of human will to decide
[01:39:53] what your attitude is going to be.
[01:39:54] Yeah, dang.
[01:39:55] And today, you know, in our luxurious society, if you can consciously navigate your waste
[01:40:02] clear that of falling into the group trap, it's what it is.
[01:40:06] It's a trap.
[01:40:07] Because you don't have to, if you can do that successfully, but probably you won't
[01:40:11] fall for the tricks, man.
[01:40:13] Like that's the thing.
[01:40:14] You get air, we all get tricked.
[01:40:15] All the way down to just something is seemingly benign as marketing.
[01:40:20] This man, you'll just fall for way less tricks.
[01:40:23] You don't like those tricks out there in the world, do you?
[01:40:25] No, I don't.
[01:40:27] Probably fell for too many of them, I think.
[01:40:32] This is a, I'm gonna wrap this book.
[01:40:34] This book is not long.
[01:40:35] It's a very fast read.
[01:40:37] And actually, he goes into sort of goes into the more of the psychological, the psychiatrists,
[01:40:46] the actual academic of it than I covered, but this is a fast read.
[01:40:52] I mean, it's only 150 pages or so.
[01:40:55] And you definitely get a raw look at, at human nature.
[01:41:00] But this closing, I think, is very, very powerful.
[01:41:03] Going back to the book, a human being is not one thing among others.
[01:41:10] Things determine each other.
[01:41:12] But man is ultimately self-determining.
[01:41:17] What he becomes within the limits of endowment and environment.
[01:41:23] He has made out of himself.
[01:41:27] In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground,
[01:41:35] we watched in witness some of our comrades behave like swine.
[01:41:41] All others behave like saints.
[01:41:45] Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions,
[01:41:56] but not on conditions.
[01:42:01] Our generation is realistic for we have come to no man as he really is.
[01:42:09] After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
[01:42:17] However, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright with the Lord's
[01:42:25] prayer, or the Shema Israel on his lips.
[01:42:36] And I think that thought that man has both potentialities within himself and we've seen
[01:42:50] them over and over again.
[01:42:53] These grand expanded potentialities in extreme display.
[01:43:01] And we've talked about these situations in the podcast over and over again in the Burma
[01:43:08] Railway that was built by the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war were tortured and
[01:43:16] killed by the Japanese and the genocide and a war in the rape of Nanking.
[01:43:21] And we've also seen the other potentiality.
[01:43:30] We've seen that over and over again that potentiality of goodness and of sacrifice.
[01:43:42] Those men that we've seen over and over again that lay down their lives or for their brothers
[01:43:51] and in doing so protect our freedom.
[01:43:58] But it's important to note that again that whether the evil is actualized in the minds
[01:44:08] of men that is not based on conditions but on decisions.
[01:44:18] And this doesn't only apply to good evil, of course, that's the most expansive thought
[01:44:25] that we can apply this to but it also applies to everything we choose to do or choose
[01:44:31] not to do and everything we choose to become or not to become.
[01:44:40] It's us.
[01:44:42] It's our choice and we are responsible.
[01:44:51] We are responsible to be good instead of evil to be strong instead of weak to become what
[01:44:58] we want to become not what we let ourselves become.
[01:45:06] We own the course.
[01:45:13] And with every decision that we make we actualize ourselves would become what we choose.
[01:45:25] Swine or saints.
[01:45:35] So when you make decisions every decision think about where that decision leads and what
[01:45:49] that decision will make you become.
[01:45:56] And then self-determined.
[01:46:06] What will make you a better person.
[01:46:12] And even in situations where you feel you have no choice at all, you still have one last
[01:46:20] freedom and that is to choose your own attitude in any given set of circumstances.
[01:46:31] Keep that choice.
[01:46:36] Keep that freedom that hard choice.
[01:46:42] The disciplined choice.
[01:46:49] With the discipline to make the right choice maintain your freedom.
[01:47:02] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:47:19] Is it an crazy home?
[01:47:20] I can't help but think of this.
[01:47:22] Like where how they talk about the SS officers, the Nazis, the guys there who are just
[01:47:31] savages.
[01:47:32] Obviously, but are they really savages as people?
[01:47:37] Or is it a circumstantial thing?
[01:47:39] I know they're trained to regard the Jews or these groups of people as being any them and
[01:47:44] all this stuff.
[01:47:47] Are they savages as individuals?
[01:47:49] Because it takes a savage to do some of this stuff.
[01:47:52] Especially grabbing a baby and smashing his books and scolds against the wall.
[01:47:58] That's subhuman behavior.
[01:48:01] When he goes home, he has kids.
[01:48:05] He's like, I don't care if these kids ultimately, if their heads get in, I'm sure he's
[01:48:10] not like that.
[01:48:11] I'm sure he's just a normal person who just be just as weak as all of us if your
[01:48:15] kid stubs its toe and starts crying.
[01:48:19] Yeah, well, we're going to explore.
[01:48:20] I've got some books in the queue to explore the other side of this and they're very
[01:48:25] revealing about some of that.
[01:48:27] But again, it's you're right, that some of these guys were normal, right?
[01:48:38] Some of these Nazis were normal and they were doing their job and that's one of the worst,
[01:48:44] there's a whole argument on whether that even is allowable.
[01:48:51] If you're doing your job and I'll tell you what, in the US military, that doesn't work.
[01:48:56] That's an excuse that we don't have.
[01:48:58] You can't say, hey, I got ordered to do this thing that was against the law or against ethical
[01:49:03] values doesn't matter.
[01:49:05] I still can't do it.
[01:49:06] That's not an excuse.
[01:49:07] And that came directly from this attitude that Nazi said, hey, I was just falling
[01:49:11] orders.
[01:49:12] Hey, what's my father's just falling orders?
[01:49:13] No, actually, you can't say that.
[01:49:15] You know, I'll have to say that.
[01:49:16] So as far as the normalcy, sure, they might have been normal when they went home, but that
[01:49:22] doesn't remove their guilt at all.
[01:49:24] Yeah, fully.
[01:49:25] You can't take a baby and smash it's head against the wall.
[01:49:28] You don't get a pass on that one, whether you ordered to do it or not.
[01:49:32] There's certain moral standards that exist and you can't violate them.
[01:49:36] And if you do, you're guilty.
[01:49:37] It doesn't matter what else you did.
[01:49:39] Back then, who was kind of the authority on that?
[01:49:45] Where the moral was it like a global thing?
[01:49:48] Or is it because obviously Hitler would be like, hey, whatever?
[01:49:52] Well, there's different societies that had different viewpoints.
[01:49:56] Obviously, and not to, hence the war, the Nazis and the Japanese both felt, okay, we can
[01:50:04] do what we need to do to dominate.
[01:50:06] And whether that's the rap and an king or whether that's the concentration camps and the
[01:50:10] final solution, both those things were in their societies.
[01:50:14] Now there was, of course, there was people inside those societies.
[01:50:18] I don't know, I don't know of any Japanese.
[01:50:21] I'm sure there were some Japanese that were against them.
[01:50:23] And even when we'd read the rap and an king, there was a Nazi in an an king, remember
[01:50:27] that sheltered people.
[01:50:29] So there's an example.
[01:50:30] Here's a guy now.
[01:50:31] He didn't know what was going on with the final solution back in Germany.
[01:50:36] At least it doesn't appear that way.
[01:50:38] But yeah, this is what makes morality and ethical decision making so challenging.
[01:50:46] But there is, in my opinion, you know, a certain standard moral code that human beings
[01:50:52] live by.
[01:50:54] And that is a universal, relatively, you know, now there's now a lot of people.
[01:51:00] I should actually say it's universal.
[01:51:01] There's the way that I believe that there's morals and standards that human beings
[01:51:06] live by.
[01:51:07] And when you start stepping outside those bounds, you're going on the wrong side.
[01:51:12] Yeah, and like anything, man, it's like obviously a spectrum.
[01:51:15] And then what you're talking about that universal line that you cross, it's actually
[01:51:19] when you really look at the line, it's like a universal gray area of, and then you really
[01:51:23] look closer.
[01:51:25] But I think that the circumstances don't really fall within the confines of that gray area
[01:51:31] very often.
[01:51:32] So it's easy to be like, that's obviously right.
[01:51:34] That's obviously wrong.
[01:51:35] But then everyone's in all these gray areas of emergent.
[01:51:39] And it's like this big debate and it depends on who you are.
[01:51:41] Yeah.
[01:51:42] I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas to be honest with you.
[01:51:45] Like in my fall pattern, I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas.
[01:51:47] I spend time because to me, it is pretty obvious.
[01:51:50] Like when you're ISIS and you're systematically raping 12 year old girls and boys, you
[01:51:57] don't get to live.
[01:51:58] That doesn't work.
[01:51:59] Yeah.
[01:52:00] That's not part of my deal over here.
[01:52:02] You die.
[01:52:03] And when you take people and you put them in cages and you burn them to death, you don't
[01:52:08] get to do that.
[01:52:09] Like these Nazis that are putting people in the context, you don't get to do that.
[01:52:12] No.
[01:52:13] We go to war, we fight, and we win.
[01:52:16] That's the way it works.
[01:52:17] Now these gray areas that you're talking about, I don't mess around in those gray areas.
[01:52:21] Yeah.
[01:52:22] I think there's too much, there's turbulence in there.
[01:52:26] And a lot of times you look at it from the outside and it's hard to tell what it is.
[01:52:31] What it actually is happening in there.
[01:52:33] Right?
[01:52:34] I'll, and maybe that's not the best policy.
[01:52:36] But I won't escalate something personally until I see it go outside the lines of what
[01:52:41] I deem to be.
[01:52:42] Okay.
[01:52:43] Yeah.
[01:52:44] Once you get outside those lines, you're done.
[01:52:45] Well, thankfully you're, you know, a little bit smart in a way where, you know, whether
[01:52:51] you name these things or not, there's always a particular standard that you go by, you
[01:52:55] know.
[01:52:56] So just like the difference between killing someone and when someone says murder, you
[01:53:01] know, murder is clearly defined.
[01:53:04] So if you murder someone, like killing someone is this broad thing, you kill them accidentally
[01:53:11] killed them, you killed them after planning.
[01:53:13] Yeah.
[01:53:14] There's a million.
[01:53:15] The revenge and all that, you know, that's killing someone, but murder is defined.
[01:53:18] You know, so, well, somebody asked me when I, I would attempt for a second time and
[01:53:24] someone asked me something along the lines of, well, who defines these rules, which is
[01:53:28] basically what you just asked me.
[01:53:30] And I think it actually, there is an answer to who defines these rules in warfare.
[01:53:33] It's the law of armed conflict.
[01:53:34] It's like a Geneva convention.
[01:53:36] We follow those laws.
[01:53:37] Right.
[01:53:38] They're very clearly defined what you can and can't do.
[01:53:39] That's it.
[01:53:40] Next question.
[01:53:41] Yeah.
[01:53:42] And I mean, unless you straight up disagree with the Geneva convention, you know, and
[01:53:46] because of your personal moral code, but as long as you have again, a standard that you're
[01:53:50] going by that'll reduce the gray areas by a lot.
[01:53:53] And still, we're going to be there, but it's easier to operate in black and white when
[01:53:58] you have standards.
[01:53:59] And it won't always be easy, but, you know, it's like, well, let me, let me, let me,
[01:54:03] let me do this.
[01:54:04] This, this, when we start getting in the gray area, and you're sitting here saying,
[01:54:06] that I'm all black and white, and that's, I'm actually saying that.
[01:54:09] Like, okay, I want you across this line.
[01:54:10] But guess what?
[01:54:11] Those lines can get blurry too.
[01:54:13] Yeah, because I heard about a guy that was on a documentary who is, he was, he was
[01:54:19] a Western journalist of some kind, and I got to watch this documentary, I'm sure someone
[01:54:23] will tell us what it is.
[01:54:24] But somebody else told me about it.
[01:54:25] The Western journalist, he's embedded with insurgence in Iraq.
[01:54:33] And he's filming.
[01:54:34] And we're going out in attacking coalition forces.
[01:54:37] Yeah.
[01:54:38] Right.
[01:54:39] And I guess he was, while he's doing it, you know, he's trying to get a story
[01:54:42] and do his job, but then all of a sudden they're attacking coalition forces, right?
[01:54:46] Now there's a gray area.
[01:54:47] Now let's say, if you want to take that example to the extreme, if we're in a fire
[01:54:52] fight, and I see a guy with a camera who's wearing a press badge following an insurgent.
[01:54:58] Right.
[01:54:59] I mean, I think I'm going to work out good for him.
[01:55:02] Because it's not like I'm going to say, okay, well, you know, he's clearly with insurgents.
[01:55:06] But what I'm saying is that's, that's one example of many that that you could get into,
[01:55:12] where also another thing that happened in Iraq a lot was people change sides.
[01:55:16] And then went from supporting the terrorist, to supporting the coalition, and then back
[01:55:19] again, and then back again.
[01:55:21] So how do you balance those?
[01:55:26] And I'll tell you how I balance them was how can we achieve our mission?
[01:55:31] And that sounds like one of those, hey, mission focus.
[01:55:34] But it's true.
[01:55:35] I look at, okay, this guy, you know, a year ago was being targeted by coalition forces
[01:55:41] for being a bad guy.
[01:55:43] Now he has changed course.
[01:55:46] So what am I supposed to do?
[01:55:47] Still prosecute him?
[01:55:48] Or is he going to help us achieve our mission of overall victory?
[01:55:50] I guess what I'm going to do?
[01:55:52] I'm going to cut him some moral slack because we're going to win.
[01:55:57] So those are hard things to.
[01:55:59] But that's exactly what I mean.
[01:56:00] They'll see the standard in your case became the overall mission.
[01:56:06] Yes.
[01:56:07] So you know, you have that saying it's not like just some guy floating down the road
[01:56:09] through life being like, I don't feel good about that right there.
[01:56:12] So I feel this way.
[01:56:13] So I'm going to do it.
[01:56:14] It's not that it's like the standard very concrete attached to it.
[01:56:17] Still great areas.
[01:56:18] Gunny emerged, but like I said, it just reduces that great area.
[01:56:20] Yep.
[01:56:21] And then the bottom line is, this is why leadership is hard.
[01:56:26] Yes.
[01:56:27] So the whole idea of leadership, whether it's in combat or whether it's in the business
[01:56:31] world or whether it's part of a team or whether it's part of a family or whether it's
[01:56:34] in a concentration camp or whether it's in a prisoner of war camp.
[01:56:38] Leadership is hard.
[01:56:39] There's gray areas like when Captain Plum was saying, hey, he got told an order, you
[01:56:45] know, make communications with this guy at all costs.
[01:56:49] At all costs.
[01:56:50] That means I'm going to get beaten and tortured and died by the guards to get this guy
[01:56:54] this piece of communication.
[01:56:55] Is he going to follow that?
[01:56:57] Yes.
[01:56:58] No.
[01:56:59] He had to make a judgment.
[01:57:00] And so you know what, though that doesn't make sense.
[01:57:03] That doesn't make sense.
[01:57:04] So this gray area that went outside the bounds of the gray area.
[01:57:07] And he said, no, I'll do my best.
[01:57:09] I understand that it's critical, but I'm going to stay within me staying alive.
[01:57:16] Right?
[01:57:17] So that is what makes leadership hard.
[01:57:20] Is you have to constantly make these decisions where there's their gray area and you're
[01:57:25] doing your best.
[01:57:26] And that's, that's again, to me it was always, I love that.
[01:57:30] I love that about leadership.
[01:57:32] I love weighing those decisions out.
[01:57:34] And I love discussing them with my guys up and down the chain of command and saying, hey,
[01:57:37] here's where we're at.
[01:57:38] Let me tell you exactly where we're at.
[01:57:39] You know, I'll use life.
[01:57:41] I'll be, you know, life here's what's going on.
[01:57:43] This is the situation.
[01:57:44] What do you think?
[01:57:45] Yeah.
[01:57:46] Well, I think that's okay.
[01:57:47] That's a good point.
[01:57:48] But did you think about that?
[01:57:49] Oh, that's a good one.
[01:57:50] You know what I mean?
[01:57:51] We're going to have those conversations.
[01:57:52] And I had never had any problem opening my mind up to these various opinions that people had.
[01:57:56] And I think as a leader, that's a huge piece of building trust up and down the chain of
[01:58:03] command is when you have an open mind to discuss things with people.
[01:58:06] And that also double gravitational pull echo Charles helps you build the relationship.
[01:58:12] Yeah.
[01:58:13] Helps you build the relationship and helps you say, oh, you know what?
[01:58:15] Like, what's the minute I'm in there and I'm talking to him like, hey, I got we got
[01:58:18] a gray area here.
[01:58:19] You know, we got a customer that is threatening to put us on the help, but we didn't do
[01:58:24] anything wrong.
[01:58:25] How do you think we should handle it?
[01:58:27] Okay.
[01:58:28] Well, you think we should just tell him, go ahead and put it on Yelp.
[01:58:32] We don't care and we'll go to Yelp and we'll talk to him.
[01:58:35] That might be the good answer.
[01:58:36] But also it might be good to say, bro, wait, why are you so mad?
[01:58:40] Customer?
[01:58:41] Let's talk.
[01:58:42] Hey, we want to refund you.
[01:58:43] We want to take care of you because our customers are important to us.
[01:58:46] Maybe you'll give us a positive thing on you.
[01:58:47] You know what I'm saying?
[01:58:48] There's all this gray area.
[01:58:49] Yeah.
[01:58:50] And if you have an open mind to discuss things with your team.
[01:58:53] Open down the chain of command.
[01:58:55] You know what you'll do is you'll get in that gray area.
[01:58:58] You'll start to get clarity.
[01:59:00] You'll start to get clarity and you'll start to see better.
[01:59:03] And you can move through the gray area without being without being so decisive that in a gray
[01:59:12] area, you don't know if it's black or white, right?
[01:59:14] So if you decide as the leader, I'm going black.
[01:59:18] Going black.
[01:59:19] Then when the gray area clears up, it was white that you should have gone with.
[01:59:22] Yeah.
[01:59:23] You don't need to do that.
[01:59:24] In many cases, you can say, okay, I'm going to lean a little bit towards the black
[01:59:27] because that's what I'm feeling.
[01:59:28] And then all of a sudden you start moving there and you start seeing that, no, this
[01:59:30] is going to be a white decision.
[01:59:32] Yeah.
[01:59:33] Okay, I can recover from that.
[01:59:34] I can move backwards and repair what decision was made.
[01:59:38] And the best way to do that is say, hey, guys, here's the situation.
[01:59:42] I thought that black was going to be the right decision.
[01:59:44] I started leaning in that direction.
[01:59:46] I was wrong.
[01:59:47] Now I see that white is the right answer and we're going with white.
[01:59:52] Does anyone have any questions about that?
[01:59:54] Does everyone understand why I did that?
[01:59:56] Oh, you don't understand why?
[01:59:57] Let me explain it to you.
[01:59:58] Here's what I thought.
[01:59:59] Here's what I saw.
[02:00:00] Next time, do you want me to wet contact you?
[02:00:02] So you could, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:00:03] And by the way, when I'm doing that, I'm building relationships with my team, which is
[02:00:06] what I want to do.
[02:00:08] I just was talking to leader the other day.
[02:00:10] And I told him and reiterated something.
[02:00:12] I'm saying, over and over again.
[02:00:14] But people that did things for me and the teams that were in the Army, the Marine Corps,
[02:00:19] in the SEAL teams, in my platoon, up and down the chain of command, doesn't matter.
[02:00:22] 99.9% of it.
[02:00:24] Wasn't because I had some kind of rank or privilege over them.
[02:00:28] It was always because I had a good relationship with people.
[02:00:31] And when you build that good relationship with people, that's what it's all about.
[02:00:34] Then they do things for you.
[02:00:36] And you know what?
[02:00:37] You do things for them, too.
[02:00:39] It's not a one way street that I'm talking about, because you won't build any relationships
[02:00:42] if you're building a one way street.
[02:00:43] No one's going to be your friend after you just take advantage of them over and over again.
[02:00:47] Like those people that call you only when they need something from you.
[02:00:51] Now I actually don't have a problem with that, because I don't communicate with a lot of people.
[02:00:56] I communicate on social media with a bunch of different people.
[02:01:00] They'll get you there too.
[02:01:01] But as far as, if, like, when one of my buddies calls me up and says, hey, I need this favor.
[02:01:06] I'm like, cool, on it.
[02:01:08] I haven't talked to him for nine months.
[02:01:10] He's only calling me because he needs something from me.
[02:01:12] Doesn't matter.
[02:01:13] People do that with me all the time and it's cool.
[02:01:15] Now it's in a big group of people.
[02:01:16] It's like six people in the world.
[02:01:20] And those same six people, they don't call the wish me happy birthday.
[02:01:22] They don't call them tell me, you know, Merry Christmas.
[02:01:27] They call me up and say, hey, I need this from you.
[02:01:30] Can you do it?
[02:01:31] I'm like, got it.
[02:01:32] No factor.
[02:01:33] Do you even have a birthday negative?
[02:01:35] I have a maybe factor in the day.
[02:01:37] So funny.
[02:01:39] I'm just trying to imagine someone calling you to wish you have a birthday.
[02:01:44] I mean, maybe like your wife was at awkward when I got in the civilian sector and people
[02:01:48] would be like, when's your birthday?
[02:01:50] I'm going to be like, why won't you?
[02:01:51] What are you talking about?
[02:01:52] Why are you trying to get my personal information?
[02:01:54] I'm going to attack you.
[02:01:55] Yeah.
[02:01:58] Hey, what's the inner you?
[02:02:00] No.
[02:02:01] You know, that's the thing.
[02:02:02] What was the other funny thing about the birthday deal?
[02:02:05] Well, that's a getting present.
[02:02:06] I'm not good with presents.
[02:02:08] Yeah, man.
[02:02:09] But don't get me any presents.
[02:02:10] Right.
[02:02:11] Because I don't want what you got me.
[02:02:12] Yeah.
[02:02:13] If I want something I already have to get it.
[02:02:15] Yeah.
[02:02:16] And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to be appreciated.
[02:02:19] There's a one gift that my wife got me one time.
[02:02:22] And I haven't, I've been thinking about why I haven't talked about this particular whole situation.
[02:02:27] And that's, there's a band called the white stripes.
[02:02:29] Sure.
[02:02:30] Light stripes.
[02:02:31] And the white stripes.
[02:02:32] Jack white, Meg white.
[02:02:34] The white stripes are awesome.
[02:02:36] They're an awesome band.
[02:02:38] And there's so many layers with the white stripes.
[02:02:41] The first of all, there's, I'll tell you two layers that I love about the white stripes.
[02:02:44] Number one, all their clothing, guitars, drums, keyboards, everything that they have on stage.
[02:02:53] And everything that they have on their record albums, everything that they have is either red, black, or white.
[02:02:59] On all the records since day one.
[02:03:01] That's number one.
[02:03:02] Number two, they only have three sounds in any other songs at any one time.
[02:03:11] So those three sounds could be drums, vocals, guitar.
[02:03:15] They could be drums, keyboards, vocals.
[02:03:18] They could be keyboards, guitar, vocals.
[02:03:21] But they only have three sounds at any one time.
[02:03:23] Vocals is one of the songs.
[02:03:24] Oh, this is one of the songs.
[02:03:25] Yeah.
[02:03:25] There's only two people in the band.
[02:03:27] Anyways, the white stripes is an awesome band.
[02:03:31] And my wife bought me tickets to go see the white stripes.
[02:03:35] Now, I didn't even think about.
[02:03:37] I never pay attention to when bands are playing or whatever.
[02:03:39] So my, I was, I was, I don't use this term very often, but I was overjoyed.
[02:03:45] That she got me tickets to the white stripes.
[02:03:48] I was so stoked.
[02:03:50] And then Meg White had some issues.
[02:03:54] And they canceled the whole tour and they never played again.
[02:03:56] They were like a couple weeks away from being in San Diego.
[02:03:59] Where I was going to go see the white stripes.
[02:04:00] So the question is, ultimately, ultimately,
[02:04:03] Grand scheme of things.
[02:04:04] Was that a good gift to give, Joko?
[02:04:06] That was an awesome gift to give me.
[02:04:08] So it was, it was the thought that counts in this case.
[02:04:11] It was a beautiful thought.
[02:04:13] And I was, and I couldn't believe she thought of it.
[02:04:16] Because normally it's like, oh, you got me a sweater from some story that I hate.
[02:04:20] No, I'm really hard to shop for.
[02:04:24] I'm really, if I want something, I have it.
[02:04:26] And I don't want that much.
[02:04:28] So it's like, oh, I want something I have it.
[02:04:30] Like once every 18 months, I want something.
[02:04:33] And then I get it.
[02:04:35] I'll get you like a new t-shirt or something. You wear that one.
[02:04:38] No, this t-shirt's fine. Don't get me a new one.
[02:04:40] This one works good.
[02:04:42] So, yeah, that's, yeah, it seems like a good gift.
[02:04:47] It's just going off on a tangent.
[02:04:49] I feel like you went off on a tangent.
[02:04:52] You know why? Because I was listening to the white stripes the other day.
[02:04:54] I was thinking, I never give the white stripes the props that they deserve.
[02:04:57] Yeah, I'm a jack white, the props that he deserves.
[02:05:00] As a singer songwriter.
[02:05:02] Aren't they brother and sister?
[02:05:03] They're not.
[02:05:04] They're not a big league.
[02:05:05] Allegedly.
[02:05:06] They were actually husband and wife.
[02:05:07] They got divorced, but they always claimed to be brother's sister.
[02:05:09] It's my little sister, Meg White.
[02:05:10] More like.
[02:05:11] Or this is my big sister.
[02:05:12] That's right.
[02:05:13] Yeah.
[02:05:13] It's what he always said.
[02:05:14] Thank you.
[02:05:15] It's good, man.
[02:05:16] Cool.
[02:05:17] Well, the original point was these crazy savage type people.
[02:05:22] Maybe normal people other than their crazy job.
[02:05:26] Yeah.
[02:05:27] And what's, and I'm, but I'm not saying so.
[02:05:29] It's cool.
[02:05:30] I'm not saying so.
[02:05:31] And this is your, your, your accountable for your actions.
[02:05:34] Yeah.
[02:05:35] You're going to say, well, cool.
[02:05:36] You are.
[02:05:37] Yeah.
[02:05:37] Yeah.
[02:05:38] And that's something from any leadership position.
[02:05:41] You need to be aware of.
[02:05:42] And when I say new leadership position, I mean, you as a front line trooper.
[02:05:45] Because if you as a front line trooper is getting told do something that you know as morally
[02:05:48] ethically or legally wrong and you still do it.
[02:05:50] It's on you sure you can point to finger and blame the higher ups and the higher
[02:05:53] ups should be burned to if they told you do something that was wrong.
[02:05:56] Yeah.
[02:05:57] But you need to be accountable for what you did.
[02:05:59] And that's all there is to it.
[02:06:00] Yeah.
[02:06:00] That's a rough tour.
[02:06:02] No one wants to play that game.
[02:06:04] The Nazis wanted to play that game.
[02:06:06] Oh, it's not mine.
[02:06:07] I was ordered to do this.
[02:06:08] Can't do that.
[02:06:09] Can't say that.
[02:06:10] Don't get that excuse.
[02:06:11] Yeah.
[02:06:12] You don't get the, I was a good person.
[02:06:13] And I took care of my kids.
[02:06:14] Even though I was shoving people into into a gas chamber.
[02:06:17] You don't get to play that game.
[02:06:18] No.
[02:06:19] Yeah, man.
[02:06:20] Too much.
[02:06:21] But there was a small little documentary on blind.
[02:06:23] I don't know.
[02:06:24] I don't watch the whole thing.
[02:06:25] But it was about the executioner in the middle east somewhere, you know,
[02:06:28] when these countries were, you know, he has his sword.
[02:06:31] Yep.
[02:06:32] And it's his job, you know, and he's just straight up executioner.
[02:06:35] Yeah.
[02:06:36] That's it.
[02:06:36] That's just his job.
[02:06:37] My dad's a job by the way.
[02:06:38] And he's like, yeah.
[02:06:39] It wasn't old school.
[02:06:40] Oh, it's on YouTube.
[02:06:41] Yeah.
[02:06:42] Like last week.
[02:06:43] Yeah.
[02:06:44] And there.
[02:06:44] But it's funny because the whole feel of the documentary was just real.
[02:06:47] Like, oh, yeah.
[02:06:48] This guy has a cool job.
[02:06:49] And he's like slicing people's heads off with great precision.
[02:06:52] And he's so good at his job.
[02:06:54] You know, here's his family.
[02:06:56] And they're loving, you know, and they're, you know, he's playing with his kids.
[02:06:59] It's like all this stuff.
[02:07:00] It's just weird, man.
[02:07:03] Anyway.
[02:07:04] Yeah.
[02:07:04] There's, there's,
[02:07:06] another culture.
[02:07:08] Yeah.
[02:07:09] It's weird.
[02:07:10] A lot of gray areas in that one too.
[02:07:12] But man.
[02:07:13] Indeed.
[02:07:14] Kind of.
[02:07:15] Anyway.
[02:07:16] Or not.
[02:07:17] I feel like we should go into the support.
[02:07:21] Yeah.
[02:07:22] We should go into the support.
[02:07:24] So support is one of those good things.
[02:07:26] Very dynamic.
[02:07:27] Supporting others supporting yourself.
[02:07:31] Supporting others and yourself, which is a separate category of support.
[02:07:35] My opinion.
[02:07:36] So there's yourself, others, and yourself.
[02:07:38] And others.
[02:07:39] That's not the category.
[02:07:41] When we talk about on it, we're talking about all three categories.
[02:07:44] Support yourself.
[02:07:45] By with supplementation.
[02:07:47] And we talk about supplementation all the time.
[02:07:49] But.
[02:07:50] You know, you talk about supplementation.
[02:07:52] Well, you're the one who turned it, turned me on to it.
[02:07:55] So actually some of it.
[02:07:58] I took Schumtech before you talk the before pre podcast.
[02:08:02] Pre podcast.
[02:08:03] I was on Schumtech.
[02:08:05] I was on Alpha Brain.
[02:08:06] Schumtech.
[02:08:09] I got my shipment of Alpha Brain pills.
[02:08:13] But back in, I had run out.
[02:08:15] And I was only had the instant.
[02:08:17] And so now like I said, what's nice about the pills is you got something.
[02:08:21] You got something coming to come to do the podcast.
[02:08:23] Guess what?
[02:08:24] Alpha Brain pills.
[02:08:25] And I might double up on the Alpha Brain if I think I got to really get my
[02:08:29] Gary.
[02:08:30] But it's good to have the the capsules.
[02:08:33] Yeah.
[02:08:34] As well.
[02:08:35] I dig in.
[02:08:36] But what's cool about the drink is it tastes good.
[02:08:38] And I, if you get the sweet tooth itch going and you want something sweet.
[02:08:42] And you get the peach.
[02:08:43] Yeah.
[02:08:44] The natural peach, not the spicy.
[02:08:46] The spicy has a different situation going on.
[02:08:48] The peach is just straight up like tasty.
[02:08:50] Like peach.
[02:08:51] Yeah.
[02:08:52] Peach.
[02:08:53] Peach.
[02:08:54] Yeah.
[02:08:55] Kind of like that.
[02:08:56] I dig it the pills.
[02:08:58] I dig it.
[02:08:59] And that's actually what we had.
[02:09:01] Was the pills.
[02:09:02] I said, we, because me and my brother were.
[02:09:05] Alpha Brain.
[02:09:06] But when they came out with the instant that was better.
[02:09:08] And it starts to become like this little kind of ritual.
[02:09:10] You know, you mix up your Alpha Brain.
[02:09:12] You know, kind of thing.
[02:09:13] And it's instant.
[02:09:14] I don't know.
[02:09:15] Just seems like either way it doesn't matter.
[02:09:17] If I haven't mentioned it already, I think I did.
[02:09:19] These are supplements from on it on it.
[02:09:22] On it.com.
[02:09:23] We talked about the supplements.
[02:09:25] But there's like workout side.
[02:09:27] I just bought a jump rope.
[02:09:28] Did you?
[02:09:29] Yeah.
[02:09:30] See.
[02:09:31] So when I was young, I was good at jumping rope too.
[02:09:34] Yeah.
[02:09:35] And then as I, you know, as I think kind of when, when, I don't
[02:09:40] maybe early 20s kind of stopped.
[02:09:42] So that's long time ago.
[02:09:43] Jump rope is awesome.
[02:09:45] Yeah.
[02:09:46] So as in, you know, you know, how like writing a bike.
[02:09:48] You can stay good at something a little bit.
[02:09:50] You're rusty.
[02:09:51] You're rusty.
[02:09:52] Yeah.
[02:09:52] Definitely give me rusty.
[02:09:53] You can't shred.
[02:09:54] And can't go as long.
[02:09:55] You know, like that could stuff.
[02:09:56] It's weird because it, you know how jump rope is.
[02:09:58] You know what's your weirdest back in the day of boxing?
[02:10:00] And no.
[02:10:01] Yeah.
[02:10:02] Boxing jumping rope for three minutes was like no factor.
[02:10:04] Yeah.
[02:10:05] Go jump.
[02:10:06] Yeah.
[02:10:07] Go get your jump rope right out.
[02:10:08] Get out.
[02:10:09] Get out.
[02:10:10] Three minutes on the ground.
[02:10:11] You feel it.
[02:10:12] Yeah.
[02:10:13] So yeah.
[02:10:14] About one of those.
[02:10:15] And it's so the interesting thing about that is.
[02:10:17] Jump rope technology has changed a little bit.
[02:10:20] So what does it made of steel?
[02:10:21] No.
[02:10:22] Well, there's, I'm sure there's steel in there.
[02:10:24] So but it's like each handle has a swivel.
[02:10:26] The little, I mean it's simple.
[02:10:27] But there's like way more to it than before last time.
[02:10:30] It was like two wooden handles and a rope.
[02:10:32] Yeah.
[02:10:33] Yeah.
[02:10:34] For sure.
[02:10:34] Actual rope.
[02:10:35] This one is like a cord that survives all this stuff.
[02:10:37] I don't know.
[02:10:38] Anyway, got a jump rope.
[02:10:39] The jump rope is on there if you want.
[02:10:41] Well, we'll have a jump off.
[02:10:43] Yeah.
[02:10:44] I was pretty good too.
[02:10:45] You had to put your nerve through.
[02:10:47] You remember when you jump rope and then when the, you know how like, and this was like elementary school.
[02:10:53] And if you get tired or you couldn't keep a rhythm, they'd say, hey, just just wave it from the front.
[02:10:59] You know, that's an angel move.
[02:11:01] Yeah.
[02:11:02] What's it called when you to turn to taro, to taro when you boom.
[02:11:06] Like I like,
[02:11:09] Matador.
[02:11:10] Is it called Matador when you just go side to side?
[02:11:13] Yeah.
[02:11:16] You can't get it or whatever.
[02:11:18] Yeah.
[02:11:19] I just get that rhythm going.
[02:11:20] Oh, yeah.
[02:11:21] I don't know the name.
[02:11:22] I never had to do that because I was expert level.
[02:11:23] Even in elementary school, but that's going to be you if, in fact, you want to step up.
[02:11:28] So you can get that on on it, not just.
[02:11:30] If you want, if you want, kettle bells on there too.
[02:11:33] The good kind.
[02:11:34] Well, kettle bells are good straight out.
[02:11:36] They're all good.
[02:11:37] And, but it has those artistic ones.
[02:11:40] Yeah.
[02:11:41] The competition ones are very cool hands.
[02:11:43] Yeah.
[02:11:44] Oh, yeah.
[02:11:45] So yeah, you get the legend bells, which is like what?
[02:11:48] Cyclops.
[02:11:49] The wear wolf.
[02:11:50] Better look at them there.
[02:11:51] There dope.
[02:11:52] You know, primal bells, which is like all that, you know, primates and stuff.
[02:11:56] Yeah.
[02:11:57] I think I got the,
[02:11:59] Chimp two chimps and two wear wolves.
[02:12:02] Yes.
[02:12:03] Yeah.
[02:12:03] I have zombie bells.
[02:12:05] Mine are just eagles on base.
[02:12:06] How big is this on?
[02:12:07] Don't want you out.
[02:12:08] I forgot I got a lock.
[02:12:09] Yeah.
[02:12:10] So it's like designer.
[02:12:11] You can you probably keep it inside too.
[02:12:13] Yeah.
[02:12:14] No, that's that's it.
[02:12:15] You really do.
[02:12:16] No, the one that I keep inside is not the ones in my garage are for the long heavy work.
[02:12:21] This one is for, oh, I'm tired of writing right now.
[02:12:24] I'm going to bang out some snatches.
[02:12:26] Right.
[02:12:27] Boom.
[02:12:28] Boom.
[02:12:29] God.
[02:12:30] Feel a lot better now.
[02:12:31] Yeah.
[02:12:32] Right.
[02:12:33] Yeah.
[02:12:34] There you go.
[02:12:34] But yeah, this is anyway.
[02:12:35] The point there is there's very cool things on the website on it.com.
[02:12:39] And the supplements, it's not to mention this.
[02:12:42] The fact is the supplements are straight up the best ones straight up.
[02:12:47] Because from the beginning and how is this?
[02:12:50] And I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
[02:12:54] I do.
[02:12:55] I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
[02:12:55] I do.
[02:12:56] I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
[02:12:58] I do.
[02:12:59] I listen to Joel Rogan all the time and he says these things.
[02:13:02] And I believe him.
[02:13:04] If you get like, I don't know.
[02:13:06] Shroom tech.
[02:13:07] Yeah.
[02:13:08] I don't even feel it.
[02:13:09] I got tapped out.
[02:13:10] So, you know, I expect more out of Shroom tech.
[02:13:12] I expect this to make me tap out everybody.
[02:13:14] I don't like it.
[02:13:15] Send it back.
[02:13:16] No, you don't even send it back.
[02:13:18] You send them an email.
[02:13:19] Saying hey, I don't like this.
[02:13:20] I'll just send you money back.
[02:13:21] You don't have to send it back.
[02:13:22] That's pretty awesome then.
[02:13:24] Yep.
[02:13:25] But don't be trying to be like, you're going to give me my money back.
[02:13:28] And the next month after you're done with it, order some more.
[02:13:31] And then do it again.
[02:13:32] Don't do it again.
[02:13:33] Yeah.
[02:13:34] You're going to get ostracized nonetheless.
[02:13:36] Crill oil.
[02:13:37] That's the one you don't want to not have crill oil.
[02:13:39] Even if you're like a young guy in my opinion, which I should always been on crill oil.
[02:13:44] Yeah.
[02:13:45] And if you're not on crill oil, I think you are like a step behind joint wise.
[02:13:49] Which puts you behind a lot of different ways.
[02:13:52] A lot of different ways.
[02:13:53] Yeah, you didn't work and out as hard.
[02:13:54] And I was working on this hard.
[02:13:56] A struggling through various activities in everyday life.
[02:13:59] I told this story whatever, but I do it all the time.
[02:14:02] You know, when you fill up water in the big five gallon jugs.
[02:14:05] And you know, and Brad, do that at night when it's kind of cold.
[02:14:08] It's like, break your carry those things from the thing to your car.
[02:14:11] You don't want to be worried about my knees or whatever.
[02:14:15] You're back.
[02:14:16] The trials.
[02:14:17] You shouldn't be like that.
[02:14:18] And you've got to put it in there.
[02:14:19] You think I should write your own book, dude?
[02:14:22] What about like the kind of crazy trials you've been through, carrying water?
[02:14:26] I'll look cool night in Southern California.
[02:14:29] I know.
[02:14:30] You know, very fresh and pure water, by the way.
[02:14:35] Doesn't make it lighter though.
[02:14:36] You still have to struggle.
[02:14:37] But here's the thing, though.
[02:14:39] There are micro, they're called micro struggles.
[02:14:42] It's really what they are.
[02:14:43] You know, standing in line.
[02:14:45] Actually, in the same kind of thing, that's not a struggle.
[02:14:47] That's manufactured struggle.
[02:14:48] So it's like an exercise in discipline and embracing struggle.
[02:14:52] That's what it is.
[02:14:53] It's not an actual struggle bestowed upon your heap on your shoulders.
[02:14:57] You know, they have to bear in everyday life.
[02:14:59] That's not what's the standing in line.
[02:15:01] That's why if you need your book about echoes struggles.
[02:15:04] You can document these various.
[02:15:07] Me looking for a specific wine.
[02:15:10] That's why.
[02:15:11] Was there a tomato one?
[02:15:12] Two likes.
[02:15:13] We're going to tomato sauce.
[02:15:14] I went.
[02:15:15] Yes.
[02:15:16] Yeah, it's a tomato struggle.
[02:15:18] The wine struggle.
[02:15:19] The groceries now.
[02:15:20] We got the fill in the water bottles.
[02:15:21] There's four chapters.
[02:15:22] My micro struggles.
[02:15:23] Yeah.
[02:15:23] And filling up the water is not a struggle because I'm on the
[02:15:26] real oil. Oh, Omega 3 is fighting to my joint.
[02:15:29] Straight into my joints.
[02:15:30] Uptake.
[02:15:31] High percentage uptake.
[02:15:33] Anyway, get on the cruel oil.
[02:15:36] I'm on the strong bone now, too.
[02:15:37] By the way, for that's for tendons.
[02:15:41] The tendon attaching to the bone.
[02:15:44] Strong TM does it.
[02:15:46] It does it about it.
[02:15:47] I feel really good about it actually.
[02:15:49] More preventative because I lift.
[02:15:52] Yeah.
[02:15:53] Nonetheless,
[02:15:54] Strong TM that's in strong bone.
[02:15:56] That get doesn't.
[02:15:57] That doesn't hit the like the limelight isn't on that all the time.
[02:16:00] It's all on calcium most of the time.
[02:16:01] I'm like calcium.
[02:16:02] It makes your bone strong.
[02:16:03] Strong TM just as much.
[02:16:05] So get on the strong bone.
[02:16:08] A bone strength.
[02:16:10] Also.
[02:16:12] Offer brain.
[02:16:13] Obviously, shrimp tech for high performance.
[02:16:15] Go on the website.
[02:16:16] Whatever you need, they got it.
[02:16:17] They even got like a try bland peanut butter.
[02:16:21] Not butter.
[02:16:22] It's not peanut butter.
[02:16:23] It's like almond cashew and walnut.
[02:16:26] Don't know.
[02:16:27] Anyway, still dish.

[02:16:37] Really?
[02:16:38] You haven't seen?
[02:16:40] I wouldn't recommend it.
[02:16:41] I don't even know if anyone would recommend that.
[02:16:45] Also, good way to support.
[02:16:48] If you're interested in the book.
[02:16:52] Man search for meaning, Victor Franco.
[02:17:00] What I have done is I put on the website a page with all of the books.
[02:17:07] All of them.
[02:17:08] That Jocqu's covered.
[02:17:11] Everyone's a well-jocqua-covered article.
[02:17:13] The links may be all do that.
[02:17:15] But nonetheless, the books are all on there.
[02:17:17] All in order, too, by the way.
[02:17:18] So the most recent is going to be at the top.
[02:17:20] This one will be on there. It is on there.
[02:17:22] If you want to support, click on there.
[02:17:25] If you're going to get the book, click through there.
[02:17:28] Directs you straight to Amazon.
[02:17:30] What if you're doing other shopping?
[02:17:32] Hey, man. Go ahead. Do the same thing.
[02:17:34] Click on it. We have a banner on the front page, too.
[02:17:36] And then you can click on there.
[02:17:38] Yeah? And then you can do shopping.
[02:17:39] Yeah, if you want.
[02:17:40] That sounds like a good plan.
[02:17:41] Even if you buy and don't take.
[02:17:44] Also, do you have a link to your favorite duct tape on there?
[02:17:48] No.
[02:17:49] Sometimes I say things that are just so inherently brilliant.
[02:17:53] And that's what we wonder.
[02:17:54] So we will have a duct tape link.
[02:17:58] Link for sure.
[02:17:59] Yeah, just in case everyone needs duct tape.
[02:18:02] And they especially need it when they get the most of the podcasts
[02:18:05] or they're thinking about the things that they're going to be duct-caping together.
[02:18:08] Yeah.
[02:18:09] Yeah, that's true.
[02:18:10] You know why I mentioned duct tape in the beginning?
[02:18:12] And I didn't really realize this because I didn't think about it
[02:18:15] until the handful of people asked me.
[02:18:18] You know why?
[02:18:19] Because he's watching the guy relevant time.
[02:18:21] Actually, I still watch my guy right now.
[02:18:22] That's a strange thing.
[02:18:24] No, no, no.
[02:18:25] It's on the channel called Clue.
[02:18:27] CLO, oh, random channel.
[02:18:30] Yeah.
[02:18:31] It's like a retro channel kind of.
[02:18:33] Okay.
[02:18:34] Okay, for a man.
[02:18:35] No, it says that.
[02:18:36] Well, there's a new guy right by the way.
[02:18:38] A new one.
[02:18:39] Which lame?
[02:18:39] I don't think it says good as a old one, but it could be just my,
[02:18:41] you know how you get attached to your old shows.
[02:18:44] It could be that.
[02:18:45] But my guy, we was dope back in the day.
[02:18:47] So, you know, whichever.
[02:18:48] And that was this thing.
[02:18:49] Duck tape.
[02:18:50] People like to say, well, paper clip, right?
[02:18:52] My guy over with the paper, he, I never really had a paper clip.
[02:18:55] Really?
[02:18:56] He had duct tape.
[02:18:57] That was his thing.
[02:18:58] I know, sorry.
[02:18:59] I watched TV.
[02:19:00] All right, way.
[02:19:01] That's on you.
[02:19:02] And I dig it.
[02:19:03] But I was busy getting back after.
[02:19:04] He had the switch.
[02:19:05] Sorry, man.
[02:19:06] And the duct tape.
[02:19:07] That was his thing.
[02:19:08] Everything else he just found in his environment is environment, which
[02:19:10] changed from episode to episode.
[02:19:12] On the last.
[02:19:13] Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.
[02:19:16] All these platforms that provide podcasts.
[02:19:19] We're on all of them.
[02:19:20] Boom, subscribe, which everyone you use.
[02:19:23] I mean, if he's two, I guess, right?
[02:19:25] And then, do people use two platforms?
[02:19:27] Why did I do that today?
[02:19:29] There's some reason I had to go to a different platform.
[02:19:33] So, I have a backup platform.
[02:19:36] Boom, subscribe to both.
[02:19:37] Yeah.
[02:19:38] Right.
[02:19:39] Is that kind of like YouTube and Vimeo?
[02:19:41] You know, some guys who have a Vimeo account as well.
[02:19:43] I don't know why that got escalated.
[02:19:45] It's good.
[02:19:46] YouTube.
[02:19:47] Bad video.
[02:19:48] I'll tell you what.
[02:19:49] I don't know why, but this could be the reason why because YouTube.
[02:19:52] Okay.
[02:19:53] Vimeo is kind of for like professional people who fancy themselves as like film makers.
[02:19:58] Right.
[02:19:59] This is my piece that I've made in artists.
[02:20:01] It tends to be that.
[02:20:02] Right.
[02:20:03] YouTube is just like, guys, you just kind of have to.
[02:20:06] But overall, yeah, exactly right.
[02:20:07] Just throw my video.
[02:20:08] YouTube, like, you know, the tube, TV, to you.
[02:20:11] Whatever you are.
[02:20:13] Vimeo is, I don't know, the name.
[02:20:14] I guess I can think about it.
[02:20:15] But nonetheless, that's what it shook itself out to beat.
[02:20:19] You know, so it's funny when people are like, I'm not on YouTube.
[02:20:22] I'm on Vimeo.
[02:20:23] I'm on my wrist.
[02:20:24] Yeah.
[02:20:25] Do you have to do anything to be on Vimeo or you're just still something to do?
[02:20:29] No.
[02:20:30] Same exact thing.
[02:20:31] It's exactly like YouTube except for the fact, which now that I'm thinking about it makes sense,
[02:20:35] where if you upload a video and you're like, oh man, in one of these titles midway through the video,
[02:20:40] I spelt it wrong.
[02:20:41] Which happens to me sometimes.
[02:20:43] You can go back into your account and replace the video, even if it's been up for a week.
[02:20:48] You can just replace or you too.
[02:20:49] Vimeo, YouTube, you cannot.
[02:20:51] Yes, a new video.
[02:20:52] Yeah.
[02:20:53] So you got to upload again.
[02:20:54] And here's the thing.
[02:20:55] You can't upload the same file.
[02:20:57] Got to rename it.
[02:20:58] Because YouTube, no, you got to re-eat it.
[02:21:00] It has all these little information in the file.
[02:21:02] They'll be like, hey, that's a duplicate file.
[02:21:04] You can't do that.
[02:21:05] You know, probably had something to do with advertising.
[02:21:08] I don't know.
[02:21:09] Nonetheless, subscribe to Jockel Podcast on YouTube.
[02:21:12] If you like that channel, we're trying to provide what you call providing value.
[02:21:17] You know, that's, don't say that.
[02:21:19] But that's another, it sounded cool when I first heard it.
[02:21:23] But it's another, that's another, it's a new, like,
[02:21:28] that's another one of those things where it sounded cool.
[02:21:31] And then everyone thought like me or I think like everyone else, whatever.
[02:21:35] And so everyone started using it now.
[02:21:37] It's like people are abusing it.
[02:21:38] And maybe here, just trying to provide value.
[02:21:40] It just starts to sound like that.
[02:21:43] You know, good voice, you just have to think, you know, we don't do voices.
[02:21:45] Other than exclamation.
[02:21:48] Thanks, Jockel.
[02:21:50] Anyway, subscribe to YouTube.
[02:21:52] We're trying to provide some value there with the excerpts and various other clips.
[02:21:58] Aside from the video version of this podcast, you're Memorial Day 1.
[02:22:03] It was really good.
[02:22:04] I liked it.
[02:22:05] It was a powerful, powerful letter.
[02:22:07] Yeah.
[02:22:12] Bunch of other stuff.
[02:22:13] Um, like.
[02:22:17] Jockel has a store.
[02:22:19] It's called Jockel Store.
[02:22:21] If you didn't know already, no.
[02:22:22] Jockelstore.com.
[02:22:23] What do we have in Jockel Store?
[02:22:24] We have T-shirts.
[02:22:26] If you were to show it to Jockel, also as a podcast.
[02:22:28] Sure.
[02:22:29] Jockel.
[02:22:30] Jockel has white tea.
[02:22:31] It's called Jockel White Tea.
[02:22:32] Yeah, I think I see a trend here.
[02:22:34] Yeah.
[02:22:35] Yeah, the trend is real.
[02:22:36] Yeah, sure.
[02:22:37] Um, nonetheless, the shit.
[02:22:39] A virginality and name.
[02:22:40] Well, no.
[02:22:42] Yeah.
[02:22:43] So in a way, because here, there are layers in that too.
[02:22:46] And there is sophistication to that even though it seems simple.
[02:22:49] Oh, because.
[02:22:50] There I was being sophisticated.
[02:22:52] You are being something out of it.
[02:22:53] Because there's more to Jockel than just, oh, yeah.
[02:22:55] That just happens to be my name.
[02:22:57] There's two.
[02:22:58] There's more to that goes beyond this podcast beyond the TV.
[02:23:00] Whatever.
[02:23:01] Right.
[02:23:02] Okay.
[02:23:03] So just let's just start with that fact, which is complex in and of itself.
[02:23:05] Then you're like, okay.
[02:23:07] Look, this is what roughly considered a company.
[02:23:12] Technically.
[02:23:13] Maybe.
[02:23:14] I guess if you had to.
[02:23:15] If you had to.
[02:23:16] Okay.
[02:23:17] That's me.
[02:23:17] Okay.
[02:23:18] What do I do?
[02:23:19] Like for a living.
[02:23:20] And I was like, I was like, oh, just like stuff.
[02:23:24] Yeah.
[02:23:25] And he goes, well, what would you?
[02:23:26] How would you, what he said?
[02:23:27] He said, well, how would you describe what you do?
[02:23:32] And I said, stay busy.
[02:23:35] That's what I do.
[02:23:36] Yeah.
[02:23:37] Okay.
[02:23:38] Fair enough.
[02:23:39] Yeah.
[02:23:40] There you go.
[02:23:42] But technically, because bar is.
[02:23:44] I've never heard that one in a while.
[02:23:46] Good.
[02:23:48] Jockelpot.cast.com.
[02:23:50] That's an entity.
[02:23:51] I don't know.
[02:23:52] Company business.
[02:23:53] It's a place where we have the web.
[02:23:56] It's not.
[02:23:57] Nonetheless, oh, you know what?
[02:23:58] I'm going to go ahead and out on a limb and call it a brand.
[02:24:01] It's brand-dish.
[02:24:02] Whatever.
[02:24:03] Nonetheless, if you call, okay, well, Jockel store, that's the name of the store.
[02:24:08] Yeah.
[02:24:09] Well, that's true.
[02:24:10] So, and to be honest with you, the reason that I called the podcast, Jockelpotcast,
[02:24:14] when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast, I said, Jockel Hungry.
[02:24:17] I don't even know.
[02:24:18] I don't know if I just said, I don't know if it's on the podcast or not.
[02:24:21] But he, I think he says, oh, you know, we got to go to get some food.
[02:24:24] And I was like, Jockel Hungry.
[02:24:25] And then I was like, well, we're going to do a podcast record.
[02:24:27] Jockelpotcast.
[02:24:28] But that was the initial thought.
[02:24:30] There's the layer.
[02:24:31] Makes sense.
[02:24:32] Yeah.
[02:24:33] And that's it.
[02:24:34] But even with naming the other words, I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted to do
[02:24:39] and not care.
[02:24:41] Yeah.
[02:24:42] And that makes sense.
[02:24:43] I knew we were going to talk about Jockelpot and fighting in music and in hardcore and war and death.
[02:24:48] And I just wanted to not have any limitations.
[02:24:52] And the only way I could do that, because if you can give the podcast a name like, you know,
[02:24:57] the, the, the, the, this podcast.
[02:25:00] Yeah.
[02:25:01] It's like, okay, well, then what I'm next to you know, we're talking about war and or if you call it the war podcast,
[02:25:07] but you're talking about business or if you don't talk about the leadership podcast, but you're talking about
[02:25:11] Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:25:12] So how do you get all those things into one thing?
[02:25:14] Call the Jockelpotcast and I can do whatever I want.
[02:25:16] Yeah.
[02:25:17] There you go.
[02:25:18] And if people are looking for you, they see you talk about XYZ or like, you know, I sure I can look up.
[02:25:22] XYZ.
[02:25:23] Easy connection.
[02:25:24] Yeah.
[02:25:25] And it's simple.
[02:25:26] You know, simply goes along with.
[02:25:27] Yeah, you know, and that's kind of like a thing.
[02:25:29] So why are we talking about this?
[02:25:30] I'm just saying that's what it's called Jockelpotto.
[02:25:32] Oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:25:33] So because it is a story.
[02:25:34] You know, people want to do other things in their life.
[02:25:36] Besides, listen to our ancestors.
[02:25:38] Well, you're the one chiming in.
[02:25:39] And over here, don't talk about that.
[02:25:41] I should've noticed that the other day when we had Roger Hayden on, and I gave you the silent treatment.
[02:25:46] And when you looked at me for affirmation while you were giving the advertising,
[02:25:50] I didn't even nod.
[02:25:51] I just looked at you and you got, you actually got uncomfortable.
[02:25:55] Yeah, you actually got uncomfortable.
[02:25:57] You were like, maybe you look on your face.
[02:25:59] Like, well, you look at me like I was going to give you a smile.
[02:26:02] I know, I just look at you like hurry up.
[02:26:04] And then you got uncomfortable.
[02:26:06] And I said, well, he's starting to feel it.
[02:26:08] Yeah, if you know, it works.
[02:26:09] Yeah, that's like subtle.
[02:26:11] Sure.
[02:26:12] You know, man.
[02:26:13] It's all good.
[02:26:14] You know, so do that again right now.
[02:26:16] You know, so I can talk about the story.
[02:26:18] Jockels story.
[02:26:19] Jockels story.com.
[02:26:20] If you like t-shirts.
[02:26:21] No, I'm not saying if you like t-shirts in general.
[02:26:24] I'm just saying, if you want to represent this clinical freedom,
[02:26:28] what get after it.
[02:26:29] No, the darkness.
[02:26:32] No, the darkness.
[02:26:33] That's a good one.
[02:26:35] You know, anyway, go on the search.
[02:26:38] Jockels story.com.
[02:26:39] You can see shirts if you like them.
[02:26:41] Go ahead and get one support.
[02:26:43] That's a good one.
[02:26:44] I've got some rash cards on there.
[02:26:45] One new rash card out already says get after it on it.
[02:26:48] Discipline on one sleeve.
[02:26:50] Freedom on the other sleeve.
[02:26:51] Jockel approved.
[02:26:52] Really good.
[02:26:53] I think it's good.
[02:26:55] I feel that the people who have witnessed it.
[02:27:00] Is that pompous to say, witness it?
[02:27:02] Like do some kind of a little bit of a lot.
[02:27:05] Yeah, maybe you know a lot.
[02:27:06] Anyone that's witnessed my rash card.
[02:27:09] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:10] That I bestowed upon them by way of visual.
[02:27:13] How about people that thought it was a little pretty cool.
[02:27:16] That was cool.
[02:27:17] That was really cool.
[02:27:18] That was cool.
[02:27:19] And so there it is.
[02:27:20] You go on the story.
[02:27:21] Look at him.
[02:27:22] If you think it's cool, you're going to want to witness the glory of echo Charles's rash cards.
[02:27:28] You may go to jockelstore.com and revel in the glory.
[02:27:35] Exactly right.
[02:27:37] And whatever else you want, this is good stuff on there.
[02:27:39] We added this little thing to if we're out.
[02:27:41] And I'm sure they'd like, I'm kind of treestock, you know, re-stock.
[02:27:44] Boom.
[02:27:45] But I added this little thing where if like let's say the size medium or whatever is out,
[02:27:51] it just says, oh, a little button.
[02:27:53] Notify me.
[02:27:54] But your email boom.
[02:27:55] Notify as you when it's back in stock.
[02:27:56] And again, I'm trying to put them back in stock.
[02:27:59] Ace app.
[02:28:00] Boom.
[02:28:01] But, you know, give me a day or two or whatever.
[02:28:03] I'll notify you.
[02:28:05] Boom.
[02:28:06] Also psychological warfare.
[02:28:10] If you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks.
[02:28:14] Come on.
[02:28:15] Not music tracks.
[02:28:17] Word tracks.
[02:28:19] It's like spoken word.
[02:28:22] You know, so basically what it's for is, you know, it's not like poetry.
[02:28:25] Well, arguably not poetry, but Stockholm.
[02:28:28] They're talking.
[02:28:29] Talking to us to me.
[02:28:31] Joc was talking to me.
[02:28:33] That actually quite literally was talking to you when that was made.
[02:28:36] Exactly right.
[02:28:37] So, you know, you can have me talk to you.
[02:28:39] So basically what it's for is he's not just talking.
[02:28:42] Every day stuff.
[02:28:43] So when you have hard time waking up in the morning or you have hard time because you're tired
[02:28:47] and you want to skip the workout or you have hard time because, you know, it's lunchtime
[02:28:51] and I'm all hungry and all they have is donuts here or whatever.
[02:28:55] What else is there?
[02:28:56] What if you're procrastinating?
[02:28:58] Also, if you're procrastinating or what do you call it?
[02:29:01] What if you're procrastinating?
[02:29:02] What if you're procrastinating?
[02:29:03] The podcast.
[02:29:04] Maybe you could listen to that one right now.
[02:29:07] We did.
[02:29:08] I'm trying to explain this thoroughly.
[02:29:10] So we can all have a really good understanding of what it is.
[02:29:14] And it's value.
[02:29:15] It's down over the moment.
[02:29:17] Me talking about moments of weakness so you can get through them.
[02:29:21] Yeah.
[02:29:22] Next comment.
[02:29:24] Yeah.
[02:29:25] I guess.
[02:29:26] Let me add this one more thing.
[02:29:28] Oh.
[02:29:29] Actually, you can even take it at moments of triumph and strength.
[02:29:33] And it will still work.
[02:29:35] You'll just want to do it more.
[02:29:37] You know?
[02:29:38] Yeah.
[02:29:39] It's like drinking coffee when you're not tired.
[02:29:41] You know what I mean?
[02:29:42] Yeah.
[02:29:43] Double down.
[02:29:44] That's sink in.
[02:29:45] It's like a lot of work.
[02:29:46] It's like a lot of work.
[02:29:47] Fair on iTunes.
[02:29:48] Amazon music.
[02:29:49] All these music.
[02:29:50] Google play.
[02:29:51] Google play.
[02:29:52] I think it's on everything.
[02:29:53] Cool.
[02:29:54] But yeah, man.
[02:29:55] Do it.
[02:29:56] Right on.
[02:29:57] All right.
[02:29:58] Also, you can get jacquo white tea on Amazon.
[02:29:59] And when you order jacquo white tea, make sure you also order more weights for your barbells.
[02:30:07] Because your deadlift is going to go up to approximately 8,000 pounds.
[02:30:11] So you need to get that much weights when you order it.
[02:30:14] Way the warrior kid.
[02:30:16] Book.
[02:30:17] It's been out for a couple weeks now.
[02:30:20] And thank you for getting it.
[02:30:23] Also, a little warning that someone put on Amazon in their review.
[02:30:30] I thought it was worth hearing and thinking about parents.
[02:30:33] Be ready.
[02:30:34] I bought this book after listening to jacquo on the Joe Rogan podcast where jacquo was the guest.
[02:30:37] Great podcast bought the book after learning jacquo has a book for kids.
[02:30:40] My son who isn't very motivated yet was excited about the book.
[02:30:45] When he started reading the book, a fire lit underneath him.
[02:30:48] He said to me, dad, I'm going to get up tomorrow at 5 a.m.
[02:30:51] Will you get up with me?
[02:30:53] And that moment I realized that I was going what was going on.
[02:30:57] And I couldn't let him down.
[02:30:59] I enjoy my sleep like everyone else.
[02:31:02] But I was amazed that my son got excited to order a pie.
[02:31:05] Yes, let's do it.
[02:31:06] Got up at 5 a.m.
[02:31:07] And there's a alarm clock must not have gone off, but I turned on his light and his bedroom.
[02:31:11] And he got right up.
[02:31:12] He got his clothes and shoes on and we went for a jog.
[02:31:15] We've never done this before.
[02:31:17] I had him do some sit ups and pushups after and he gladly did.
[02:31:21] Couldn't quite do pushups if that's okay.
[02:31:23] We'll get there.
[02:31:25] Long story short.
[02:31:26] This book only being a few chapters.
[02:31:28] And he only a few chapters in.
[02:31:29] That was kind of surprise.
[02:31:30] I saw that.
[02:31:31] Only a few chapters in.
[02:31:32] Made the book worth getting.
[02:31:34] In this day and age of electronics and iPads and tablets kids don't seem to be as motivated
[02:31:39] to do activities as when I was a kid.
[02:31:41] I'm 39.
[02:31:42] So I edified him after for making the decision to get up at 5 a.m.
[02:31:47] on a non school day.
[02:31:48] And I told him that he can apply that mentality to anything in life.
[02:31:52] Boom.
[02:31:53] Way the warrior kid.
[02:31:54] Get it for your kid.

[02:34:13] Remember what human beings are capable of suffering through and remember that even in those situations.
[02:34:25] Where everything seems to be taken away, when you seem to have no choice at all in the world.
