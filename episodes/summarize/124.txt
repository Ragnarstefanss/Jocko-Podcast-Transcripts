I mean, this, you know, Hac worth was just, you know, he always said, you know, he wasn't bald like today, you know, but you know, eighth of an inch, you know, razor sharp, you know, sides and all that. you got issues why that's how what are you doing even 11 o'clock at night because like I don't really start eating till like later in the day you say I don't know he breakfast like that you see him playing though like let's say he eat three meals a day and that's not a lot by the way that's actually a little bit you know some guys it all it's six times a day you know that kind not like that kind three times a day sometimes too so let's say I ate my first meal no breakfast only water maybe some coffee sometimes maybe some get ready sometimes maybe like a banana sometimes not a lot nonetheless at noon ish one maybe too lunch dinner You know, they said, you have an interest called this number, you know, and so I called, you know, and he said, hey, look, pull up my record, you know, you'll see, you know, I'm, I've got my masters degree in Fari Senefers. so right then and there the army knew what they were dealing with because I you know I was you know it was an opportunity to show that we have equal opportunity and he armed forces I tell people that one of the proudest things of my service was that when I was loose track of people's race you know I stopped looking at people as as Asian American or African American and in or Hispanic Americans I looked at them as private or full lieutenant whatever their job was in the military that's how I caught myself forgetting sometimes of people you know because I tell people everybody was all of drab. And, you know, I mean, the stupid rules of engagement that we had, you know, where do you have to get approval to fire on people, even though you're receiving fire, you know, and just nutty stuff, you know, and we just say, hey, you know, we're going to do what we have to do. so we have different programs that they can choose from some are as simple as a church can list the names of service members who are currently serving you know either relatives or members of the church and people can pray for them prayer is so important when you're overseas especially in a combat situation I know it helped me a lot when I was in combat I needed all I could get I'll tell you but also they could do things like send packages send letters how today who writes letters nobody you know it's all email and all that stuff how about getting a letter right at mail call how need is that you know we're on the path all of us one great now this is inevitable I think for the most part inevitable where you know hit moments of weakness sometimes you need a little help through those moments of weakness sometimes you need to just slip in those moments of weakness and fall and be like I'm not doing that again sometimes that's useful you learn in my opinion but in those moments of weakness where you just need a little spot this is what jockel tracks are for so let's say your weakness is not getting up early you want to hit the snooze so what you want to do to tie it on a note whatever maybe drink a little bit I don't know so you're on the fence you're like I'm gonna hit the snooze just for what what's the normal snooze 10 minutes nine minutes whatever I don't know seems to be good to tell me about that there's a mud over here it's true rotten and so you're balancing all that stuff and general Levine always remember emphasized the family he always made sure that we were aware of the stresses on the family you know when we were gone I'll never forget a microrear without fail that's when the furnace would break down that's when we'd have a blizzard so my 95 pound wife would have to go out there and shovel the snow because I wasn't there you know our son Jay who's who you know he he basically was a rascal when he was a young guy and my might have to take him to the emergency room in the hospital like three times I don't even know where it's time's a week You know, in my mind, you know, I thought everyone must look at Hac like, you know, this guy's Mr. Infantry as you put it, but I also would say to myself, well, you know, here's like, I'm thinking that because he wrote these books, and because I studied him, but that was an actual thing. he I think he's personally responsible for that balance part of my leadership concept that I've developed over my career uh he really emphasized family and and keep in mind when I joined the reserves I didn't have a clue about the citizen soldier you know those of us on air to duty what do we know about the garden reserves and their pressure you know what they do with you know people in the garden reserves have to balance three balls at the same time You know, he always said, bring your kids, you know, some guys would say, no, just, you know, bring your wife or whatever, because my kids were fairly young, and then we're really young, they were maybe eight or nine, you know, at that time. I mean, you know, but, you know, it was pretty sharp in the way of warming, you know, for my did have, you know, my jump wings and my E, I have an expert infantryman's badge, okay? And so when he came to see the general, he walks into the headquarters, you know, I'm sitting behind his desk, he walks in, so I stand up, you know, I say welcome Colonel Hacourt to Fort Lewis, you know, the general will be with you in 10 minutes, you know, because he came early, right? and I said you know what it's sad that you're surprised at that because 50 years ago everybody knew that that's where they made stuff they made it up there and it all disappeared and now it's coming back and we're bringing it back I told this guy it's a spring in a back we're bringing back made effect we got what weaving material up there you know what that you don't even know what I'm talking about people's first instinct is like You know, because, you know, really with the name which degree, as you know, you know, it's great for preparing you to understand things. so he writes a memorandum for record that to the chief of staff at the army that went into my file that said you know I spoke to John Wilmingham I told him it was you know above his paid rate levels and he might get involved with you know things that went out of hand and all that and he basically told me that he was going to wear his uniform so people come to me and say you know what difference are you guys making two years ago all I could say was what were developing this network of partners and we're asking them to help you know in their communities which did make a difference by the way I mean we prevented some suicides we've helped people that needed stuff you know okay so open decided they have a show about Japan bashing so she said if anybody knows anyone you know the Japanese American community what might be a good you know person on this please let me know Because I always felt that I shouldn't be managing my own career, you know, and if I, if I did my job, that the army would, you know, I, I'd be treated, okay, you know, well, none of that ever happened, right? I believe his name was but he had flown over heat scene what was happening he flew back to base told the senior leadership this is what's going on in the ground the senior leadership radioed into the field and said stop killing people and they they literally instantly stopped they stopped the massacre just because a leader stepped up and said stop so good leadership completely changed the situation as it was ongoing and clearly if there would have been a better leader on the ground that was leading in the right way it never would have even started so you can see here from what Hacks saying the way he led and the way he treated unknown you know people and then the way that was carried out through the whole battalion that's another amazing testament to good leadership. so I said is this in order you know from you know the secretary or from the chief I don't care you know whoever's above me is this in order and he said well I can't tell you it's in order but when we came up with this program we have a tracking thing where we know how many veterans are being helped we know what's been collected and we know so now if somebody says what difference do you make okay since January of 2016 we have helped over 31,000 veterans we've collected over 750,000 items in fact I think it's over million though and valued at almost 2 million dollars and we have we just provided this month our 1000's bed and and I said hey wait a second you know I don't have one day of finance formal education I didn't know the difference between a stock and a bond you know must for less a stock option and he said don't worry about it I felt the army was going in the wrong direction when it came to leadership I thought that they were looking for managers and not commanders I was in some positions during my career right had access to officer deficiency reports and I could see were the ratings of the senior officers that lieutenant colonels and the battalion commanders were the tendency was to give the managers high ratings irrespective of their command abilities and and then my personal career was was not managed very well the hack worth hack worth wanted me to stay he knew I was I was thinking of resigning and the fact that's why he offered me the company because you know he thought that experience might turn things around you know I'll do it and that started out of 35 year career in financial services industry and I became a member of the New York Stock Exchange the Chicago Board Options Exchange I was very blessed I became part-owner of the company so that enabled me to devote all the time I did in the reserves that I did because I was part of the deal I made with my friend I said listen if you want me to join you I'm bringing the reserves with me and you have to understand you know if I'm called I'm going and if I'm in the reserves I'm going to give it a hundred percent you know but it's real flimsy a lot of the time you got on it a lot of information on

couldn't get through whatever well I have a very I had at that time a very influential journalist in Chicago his name was Irv Cupsinet who had a very famous if's called Cups column he used to interview presidents kings and queens political people you know at in Chicago at a restaurant and yeah because you don't want to run out I'm telling you it's junk when you're at out I run out before it's wack also discipline supplement called discipline it is a pre workout pre mission pre study pre take test pre cognitive enhancing supplements good this is a good one pre get after it and it tastes good interestingly you know jacco focused a lot on that taste good lemon lime etc etc make calories in this one I don't know not not okay the army reserve and army national guard are the so-called reserve components okay now the active army of course are the 24-7 that's their full-time job the army reserves are a federal force and the army reserves fall into the normal army chain of command the partner of the army we answer to the orders of the president okay army national guard does not fall into that chain of command nor do they be poured to the president they be poured to the governors of each state it's really a state organization although 95% of their budget comes from the federal government so in their mind I'm the village idiot you know even though I have my masters degree I had commanded a company in combat I had signed for $10 million worth of equipment I had more responsibility and life than these guys will ever know you know I mean, one of the things he talks about and again, I've talked about this on another podcast, but you know, when he showed up, everyone had whatever they had guitars and they had radios and they had, you know, big hammocks for themselves and he got there and said, okay, anything that you can't carry on your back is going to be in the middle of our base tomorrow morning. Now guys, you know if there that might be something else, but we and we do not shoot civilians just you know who are who are caught with you know we we run across them just because they're there and we want to take revenge. okay we were professional in you know in the military as as you know you're not supposed to be political you're supposed to be a political right not involved in lobbying and stuff like that the national guard is very political it's jobs for the state They had lousy leadership before that and, uh, Hackworth basically said, you know, you guys are soldiers and he said, I'm going to keep you alive, you know, but you're going to have to soldier. And I remember being at the talk, you know, when he's planning on this hack, where it's had this innate quality, get just smell out the enemy, you know, even with all the intelligence we get and all this stuff, you know, he was able to figure out what they were doing. You know, I mean, hack worth always mentioned that, you know, the harder you train, you know, the better the delperform and combat. they you know they sure things they can help each other out but then to be serves in guard you know the rest of the you go to a meeting one week in a month you know and I didn't get a call back so the next morning and hour before their press conference we sent out a press release and we basically said this is not good this is you know shouldn't go through need to have a GAO study a government accounting office study and that pretty well got me into the crossers and so then what we did is and now keep in mind I had never done this in my life I had never lobbied I had never been to congress I had never walked the halls you know any of that stuff we had a we actually So I called the sky at the Pentagon and I say, hey, I'm volunteering for Vietnam again, and he basically said, well, okay, you know, give me your phone number, in case we lose connection here, and, and then he said, and I said, but I have a stipulation, I need to go to the night division, and he said, okay, I can make that happen. yeah you can't just walk into the store and start buying looms you just can't do that that's why it's hard to you know to kind that's why they have a unique situation there what's all mean in America and hey everyone that is supporting us at origin thank you because right now you know what we're doing we're expanding we're buying more machines we're buying better equipment and we're hiring more people so thank you for your support it's awesome I was and once again I'd say you've heard me say this before it's a god thing basically the army was the only service that really had a great process where we had reserve units whose wartime mission was to take over the training centers you know like the great lakes naval training center you know but I'll be there I will be there maybe not at full capacity the jiu jiu a lot of now we're going to see about some stuff long story day work life looks like life's a go j p working it well a lot of cool fun people will be there it's going to be a good good time um if last year is any indicators to be real good time also if you want to vary up your work out you want to get some kettlebells like some someone just text me today and I don't even know where it's at you know because I wasn't home so you know the stresses and and I said no I said you know the army's made it very clear you know they they don't want my services they don't think I have any value and it was a very prestigious company if anybody they had quote unquote Mitsui men you know if you were a Mitsui guy that was a big deal it was like their Harvard graduates would all go there you know and things like that do you also we have YouTube channel if you didn't already the subscribe to that one not to good way to support as well we have excerpts on there try to post every day try to sometimes two a day try to also on there is enhanced excerpts you know what I mean by that I know what you mean by what I mean you mean you put some cinematography into the scenario you film I think you know just more options we're convenient for the people good call for everybody I think nonetheless a lot of stuff on there uh if you want something just get something also psychological warfare if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jockel tracks and she said Jim you know God is sending you a message number one that you know this chapter in your life is over okay number two you survive Vietnam you also became a Tain the rank of two star general which was the highest in reserveist could get at that time yeah there's a lot of lot of cool stuff on there on there a lot of good information on there too so a lot of the questions that are directed at me I don't know the answer I sometimes don't know the answer for me as a place of me and that is every day is a great day I have my faith my family and live in the finest country in the world I say it every day every chance I got and people ask me well why you know how can you be so positive and you know why do you say that I say so he stands on the skits and they take off and he gets hit in the lake and that was the z-purple heart well after that you know he could tell the guys in the battalion I want you to walk through this wall of fire and the response would be where do you want us to go you know he he led by example but is that what caused the army you say and you gotta do this big thing if you even know how otherwise you're kind of screwed in away because you gotta go all up in there now take the origin geet these are just these details that when you get someone who's thinking of this kind of stuff when they design the whole geet you got some geet there that this is one of the many reasons why you get the origin geet this one the string comes out that's okay because it's not this this endless black hole loop holder I don't want you to say okay because you know there are a lot of people out there are clean to be veterans who are not and so we know they're going to veterans and it goes out almost as quick as it comes in and he didn't tell me I shouldn't go he kind of said that well you know it's really not a good idea you know for you to go and he was a good friend of mine If you want a company at yours, and like, I hit the lotto, you know, and frankly, I was, I was thinking of, you know, resigning my regular army commission, but I hadn't been to Vietnam yet. No not really that that read I when I mean by that is you know the whole stance that he took about Vietnam to risk his career and just actually just saying hey I'm out of here because you know I've done this now for 30 something years and frankly it was weighing on him let me talk about the moral injury of knowing that you're leading soldiers in combat when they could have been the policy could have been done better which would have resulted in fewer casualties. but I you know I was committed to doing 20 because especially at that time in 70 71 the reserve components didn't have a lot of combat experience guys and I felt that it was important that I tried to help you know the reserves be ready basically yeah enhanced excerpts that's us on there along with of course the video version of this podcast if you care the jockel looks like also jockel is a store it's called jockel store you're a jockel store dot com so obviously I know not that creative but still cool stuff on there stuff is creative I think so going there shirts hats we even got a new hat so they said okay we got the solution we'll take one out of each component right guard wouldn't accept that so what did they do they eliminated both our may reserve you know groups and I was live it because the 12th was under me at one time I wasn't the commander but it was in my chain we had taken that unit from C4 to C2 which for reserve unit to be able to get reserveist to past those special forces qualifications that's not easy and they did exactly what I told them they do because they mobilized half of my division so they just went right down the list you know down to eight or nine and that was it you know now you ended up having kind of a run in at the end of your career right I don't care you know you want me to put my uniform on this way instead of that way that's fine whatever I'll do it you want to start putting soldiers at jeopardy that won't that won't stand so here's what happened okay while all this stuff is going on the Washington Post puts this front page And they said, we just had a contact, you know, we killed three, we've kept, you know, we got four weapons, we captured a guy or whatever.
