00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.26
This is Jocco podcast number 99.

2
00:00:04.26 --> 00:00:07.14
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Winlink.

3
00:00:07.14 --> 00:00:07.98
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:07.98 --> 00:00:09.98
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.98 --> 00:00:12.02
It is a day for Q&A.

6
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:13.52
Let's go.

7
00:00:13.52 --> 00:00:14.26
Right into it.

8
00:00:14.26 --> 00:00:15.10
All right, let's do it.

9
00:00:15.10 --> 00:00:16.26
Jocco, hey, Jocco.

10
00:00:16.26 --> 00:00:18.98
As a director of our sales department,

11
00:00:18.98 --> 00:00:23.42
I require my guys to fill out sales call interaction logs.

12
00:00:23.42 --> 00:00:27.06
I have one guy who thinks because the sales are up.

13
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:28.82
This no longer is important.

14
00:00:28.82 --> 00:00:31.88
Nor does he have the time.

15
00:00:31.88 --> 00:00:33.68
How do you handle situations like this?

16
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:36.40
OK, so as I got this question, I'm like,

17
00:00:36.40 --> 00:00:37.36
OK, I've answered this before.

18
00:00:37.36 --> 00:00:38.96
I'm not going to answer it again.

19
00:00:38.96 --> 00:00:40.28
I've gotten something close enough.

20
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:41.28
And no one's interesting.

21
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:42.48
I talked to some people now.

22
00:00:42.48 --> 00:00:47.08
I talked to a lot of people and they say, hey, on Q&A,

23
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:48.44
I know what you're going to say.

24
00:00:48.44 --> 00:00:49.28
Yeah.

25
00:00:49.28 --> 00:00:49.84
I don't know how to say that.

26
00:00:49.84 --> 00:00:50.64
That's awesome.

27
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:52.88
They say I still need to hear it.

28
00:00:52.88 --> 00:00:54.56
But I know what you're going to say.

29
00:00:54.56 --> 00:00:56.68
And I said, OK, cool, that's good.

30
00:00:56.68 --> 00:01:00.16
That means people are starting to expand their brain a little bit,

31
00:01:00.16 --> 00:01:02.44
maybe see a different perspective that they might not

32
00:01:02.44 --> 00:01:03.000
had before.

33
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.04
So that's good in my opinion.

34
00:01:05.04 --> 00:01:10.52
Now, also what I realize is, as I answer these questions,

35
00:01:10.52 --> 00:01:14.68
there's additional information that comes out

36
00:01:14.68 --> 00:01:18.000
once you make a certain level of understanding,

37
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.28
then there's more understanding to be had.

38
00:01:20.28 --> 00:01:22.24
And so that's what I realized with this question.

39
00:01:22.24 --> 00:01:25.08
As I thought, well, OK, there's this standard answer.

40
00:01:25.08 --> 00:01:26.92
The standard answer is, OK, that you got people

41
00:01:26.92 --> 00:01:29.000
who are not doing what you want them to do.

42
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.80
And what do you do then?

43
00:01:29.80 --> 00:01:32.48
Well, the fact is, the real standard answer

44
00:01:32.48 --> 00:01:34.76
that everybody now knows, if you've been listening to podcasts,

45
00:01:34.76 --> 00:01:37.16
is they need to know why they're doing what they're doing,

46
00:01:37.16 --> 00:01:38.64
they need to know why it's important.

47
00:01:38.64 --> 00:01:41.20
They need to know how them filling out those forms

48
00:01:41.20 --> 00:01:45.36
will help the company and therefore help the individual

49
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:47.36
that needs to fill out the forms, because it'll

50
00:01:47.36 --> 00:01:51.44
provide better intel to the company that will provide them

51
00:01:51.44 --> 00:01:55.40
more accurate advertising which will in turn make them

52
00:01:55.40 --> 00:01:58.64
be able to sell more, which will in turn make the cost

53
00:01:58.64 --> 00:02:02.48
to produce the product go down, because they're selling more.

54
00:02:02.48 --> 00:02:05.68
And that means he has better pricing to sell things

55
00:02:05.68 --> 00:02:07.20
with an ill-being able to sell more and make more money.

56
00:02:07.20 --> 00:02:09.28
And so you have to tie that whole thread through.

57
00:02:09.28 --> 00:02:11.24
That's kind of the standard answer.

58
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:12.16
Which everybody should know.

59
00:02:12.16 --> 00:02:14.40
If someone's not doing what you want them to do,

60
00:02:14.40 --> 00:02:15.48
you need to make sure they understand

61
00:02:15.48 --> 00:02:17.08
why they need to do it, why it's important

62
00:02:17.08 --> 00:02:18.12
and how it ties back to them.

63
00:02:18.12 --> 00:02:21.28
OK, so boom, we get done with that standard answer.

64
00:02:21.28 --> 00:02:23.56
Now there's the next level.

65
00:02:23.56 --> 00:02:26.56
Now we're going to purple belt.

66
00:02:26.56 --> 00:02:30.20
And here's the non-standard answer.

67
00:02:30.20 --> 00:02:32.80
Here's the advanced answer, or the purple belt answer.

68
00:02:32.80 --> 00:02:36.64
Is OK, now let's ask yourself, this piece of paper

69
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:39.44
that you're having them fill out.

70
00:02:39.44 --> 00:02:42.52
Is it really actually important?

71
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:44.12
Is it actually important?

72
00:02:44.12 --> 00:02:47.92
What purpose does it actually serve?

73
00:02:47.92 --> 00:02:51.96
Because you want this guy who's a good producer, his sales

74
00:02:51.96 --> 00:02:53.44
are up.

75
00:02:53.44 --> 00:02:56.80
And you want him to continue to fill out these sales

76
00:02:56.80 --> 00:02:59.68
interaction logs so that you can track and make sure

77
00:02:59.68 --> 00:03:01.44
that he's making enough calls that he's got

78
00:03:01.44 --> 00:03:03.40
to write the right approach that he's using the right

79
00:03:03.40 --> 00:03:06.88
verbage when he's talking to his customers or clients.

80
00:03:06.88 --> 00:03:08.52
And so you want him to fill this up.

81
00:03:08.52 --> 00:03:10.64
But now he's actually doing well.

82
00:03:10.64 --> 00:03:15.20
And you got to ask yourself, OK, what purpose

83
00:03:15.20 --> 00:03:18.12
is this thing serving now that the guy is doing well,

84
00:03:18.12 --> 00:03:19.76
what purpose is it serving?

85
00:03:19.76 --> 00:03:22.40
Maybe at a certain level, you say, you know what?

86
00:03:22.40 --> 00:03:23.76
You don't need to fill that out anymore.

87
00:03:23.76 --> 00:03:27.56
If you sell 10 units a day, you don't need to fill this

88
00:03:27.56 --> 00:03:28.000
out anymore.

89
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.96
If you sell 80 day, you got to fill out your logs,

90
00:03:29.96 --> 00:03:33.60
because we got to check and see what you're doing.

91
00:03:33.60 --> 00:03:38.72
That's, or are you just making this person do it?

92
00:03:38.72 --> 00:03:41.88
Because that's what everyone does.

93
00:03:41.88 --> 00:03:46.88
So if you can't answer the question yourself,

94
00:03:48.24 --> 00:03:51.68
why it's important, then maybe you should check

95
00:03:51.68 --> 00:03:54.20
why you have this thing in place.

96
00:03:54.20 --> 00:03:58.92
So again, we put things in place to help people,

97
00:03:58.92 --> 00:04:01.52
but at a certain point, it is possible that they don't need

98
00:04:01.52 --> 00:04:01.96
to do it anymore.

99
00:04:01.96 --> 00:04:04.28
Some sales people, if you don't maybe want people

100
00:04:04.28 --> 00:04:06.20
to make eight phone calls a day and you want them

101
00:04:06.20 --> 00:04:07.44
to log down what they did.

102
00:04:07.44 --> 00:04:10.24
OK, what if this guy's doing 28 phone calls a day?

103
00:04:10.24 --> 00:04:13.08
And he wants to get to 38 phone calls a day,

104
00:04:13.08 --> 00:04:15.24
but he can't, because he's filling out your paperwork.

105
00:04:15.24 --> 00:04:18.24
OK, so if people are meeting the numbers,

106
00:04:18.24 --> 00:04:21.24
maybe raise the bar a little bit, make him,

107
00:04:21.24 --> 00:04:23.24
and you give him more freedom.

108
00:04:23.24 --> 00:04:25.24
He's got the self-discipline, right?

109
00:04:25.24 --> 00:04:26.24
He's got the discipline to make call.

110
00:04:26.24 --> 00:04:27.24
He's making the numbers.

111
00:04:27.24 --> 00:04:28.24
His numbers are up.

112
00:04:28.24 --> 00:04:32.24
OK, give him some more freedom.

113
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:34.24
Maybe you can turn that into more production.

114
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:36.24
If he starts to lag off, guess what?

115
00:04:36.24 --> 00:04:38.24
Hey, bud, if you keep selling 10 units a day,

116
00:04:38.24 --> 00:04:39.24
we're good.

117
00:04:39.24 --> 00:04:41.24
You don't need to fill out this crap.

118
00:04:41.24 --> 00:04:42.24
You go to nine.

119
00:04:42.24 --> 00:04:45.24
You're back on the filling out of paperwork.

120
00:04:45.24 --> 00:04:46.24
Guess what he's going to do?

121
00:04:46.24 --> 00:04:48.24
He's going to sell 10 every day, he's going to sell 12.

122
00:04:48.24 --> 00:04:49.24
He's going to sell 15.

123
00:04:49.24 --> 00:04:50.24
Yeah.

124
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:53.24
And then I would tell him, I'd say, look, if you sell 15 units a day,

125
00:04:53.24 --> 00:04:55.24
I'm going to fill out a piece of paperwork

126
00:04:55.24 --> 00:04:56.24
that says you're awesome.

127
00:04:56.24 --> 00:04:59.24
I'm going to do it every time you sell 15 units.

128
00:04:59.24 --> 00:05:00.24
It's good.

129
00:05:00.24 --> 00:05:02.24
Boom, little fun.

130
00:05:02.24 --> 00:05:03.24
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:05:03.24 --> 00:05:04.24
So that's it.

132
00:05:04.24 --> 00:05:08.24
There's the white, maybe three-stripe white belt answer.

133
00:05:08.24 --> 00:05:12.24
Everyone should know at this point, followed by a little bit more advanced,

134
00:05:12.24 --> 00:05:14.24
purple belt move, whom we'll plot a.

135
00:05:14.24 --> 00:05:16.24
Sure.

136
00:05:16.24 --> 00:05:20.24
And the same time that's not to say that it's guaranteed, not important.

137
00:05:20.24 --> 00:05:21.24
Not at all.

138
00:05:21.24 --> 00:05:22.24
You're just saying, make that evaluation.

139
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:23.24
Not at all.

140
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:26.24
And there is a chance that I'm wrong, right?

141
00:05:26.24 --> 00:05:30.24
That the paperwork that gets filled out actually really does get put into a

142
00:05:30.24 --> 00:05:35.24
data file that can then be used to target certain customers,

143
00:05:35.24 --> 00:05:38.24
or follow up with certain customers.

144
00:05:38.24 --> 00:05:41.24
And if that's the fact you explain it to the guy and how it's going to benefit him.

145
00:05:41.24 --> 00:05:43.24
And we're back to answer number one, which worked.

146
00:05:43.24 --> 00:05:44.24
Which is fine.

147
00:05:44.24 --> 00:05:46.24
Right and wrong.

148
00:05:46.24 --> 00:05:49.24
Right and wrong are interesting concepts.

149
00:05:49.24 --> 00:05:50.24
Yeah.

150
00:05:50.24 --> 00:05:54.24
And people sometimes get wrapped around right and wrong.

151
00:05:54.24 --> 00:05:55.24
Yeah.

152
00:05:55.24 --> 00:05:58.24
They just think that there's a right answer and there's a wrong answer.

153
00:05:58.24 --> 00:06:04.24
And many times, neither question or neither answer is right or wrong,

154
00:06:04.24 --> 00:06:06.24
or both answers are right and wrong.

155
00:06:06.24 --> 00:06:07.24
Yeah.

156
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:09.24
So you've got to open your mind on these things.

157
00:06:09.24 --> 00:06:10.24
You've got to open your mind.

158
00:06:10.24 --> 00:06:13.24
You know, as we talk about with GJ2 schools,

159
00:06:13.24 --> 00:06:16.24
should a GJ2 school be strict,

160
00:06:16.24 --> 00:06:17.24
bow to your professor,

161
00:06:17.24 --> 00:06:19.24
everyone where they same uniform,

162
00:06:19.24 --> 00:06:22.24
not allowed to ask people to roll,

163
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:25.24
or should it be, hey, where would whatever you want,

164
00:06:25.24 --> 00:06:27.24
the instructors named Jocco,

165
00:06:27.24 --> 00:06:29.24
and going there and crews in train hard.

166
00:06:29.24 --> 00:06:30.24
Which one is right?

167
00:06:30.24 --> 00:06:32.24
The answers that are both right.

168
00:06:32.24 --> 00:06:35.24
You both of those have benefits.

169
00:06:35.24 --> 00:06:37.24
And some people flourish in one kind of school,

170
00:06:37.24 --> 00:06:38.24
and some people flourish in another kind of school,

171
00:06:38.24 --> 00:06:40.24
and you can't say one's right or wrong.

172
00:06:40.24 --> 00:06:43.24
Same thing I used to run in this lot with in the shield things with tactics.

173
00:06:43.24 --> 00:06:46.24
Like should we enter the room like this,

174
00:06:46.24 --> 00:06:49.24
or like this?

175
00:06:49.24 --> 00:06:51.24
And the answer is actually,

176
00:06:51.24 --> 00:06:53.24
well, which is better in that scenario.

177
00:06:53.24 --> 00:06:55.24
And sometimes this one's better,

178
00:06:55.24 --> 00:06:56.24
and sometimes that one's better.

179
00:06:56.24 --> 00:06:59.24
And so if your mind can be more open,

180
00:06:59.24 --> 00:07:01.24
you'll be able to use more options,

181
00:07:01.24 --> 00:07:03.24
which is beneficial.

182
00:07:03.24 --> 00:07:04.24
Yeah.

183
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:08.24
That's the narrow kind of reminded me of one of my friends,

184
00:07:08.24 --> 00:07:10.24
it was a friend of a friend.

185
00:07:10.24 --> 00:07:13.24
And it was actually my friend's friend's life.

186
00:07:13.24 --> 00:07:15.24
And she was saying,

187
00:07:15.24 --> 00:07:20.24
yeah, she's kind of making light of the fact that they force their kids

188
00:07:20.24 --> 00:07:26.24
to watch a charger game or something on this day or whatever.

189
00:07:26.24 --> 00:07:28.24
And the kids don't like football,

190
00:07:28.24 --> 00:07:30.24
or the kid, the one kid.

191
00:07:30.24 --> 00:07:32.24
Don't like, doesn't like football, doesn't like watching football.

192
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:34.24
Doesn't like this whole thing.

193
00:07:34.24 --> 00:07:37.24
And she was like, oh no, it's a tradition, you know?

194
00:07:37.24 --> 00:07:38.24
So, you know, we make them do it.

195
00:07:38.24 --> 00:07:40.24
It's a tradition all the stuff.

196
00:07:40.24 --> 00:07:42.24
I'm kind of thinking, like, okay, I mean, that's cool.

197
00:07:42.24 --> 00:07:44.24
That it's like your tradition, but like no one likes it.

198
00:07:44.24 --> 00:07:46.24
Like so what is the tradition doing?

199
00:07:46.24 --> 00:07:48.24
I mean, I understand, like if you have a tradition,

200
00:07:48.24 --> 00:07:49.24
everyone likes it, or the tradition,

201
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:52.24
and it improves, like, I don't know, the cohesion of the family

202
00:07:52.24 --> 00:07:54.24
or something like that.

203
00:07:54.24 --> 00:07:56.24
And, you know, for all these beneficial reasons,

204
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:57.24
and one way or another beneficial.

205
00:07:57.24 --> 00:08:01.24
But, you know, if you're doing it just for the sake of, you know,

206
00:08:01.24 --> 00:08:04.24
the tradition, like this paperwork situation.

207
00:08:04.24 --> 00:08:05.24
And also, what are you doing?

208
00:08:05.24 --> 00:08:08.24
If you're telling your kid, like, no, you'll watch the football game,

209
00:08:08.24 --> 00:08:10.24
especially now that everyone hates the chargers,

210
00:08:10.24 --> 00:08:12.24
because they left San Diego.

211
00:08:12.24 --> 00:08:15.24
Yeah, this is one time ago, but, but,

212
00:08:15.24 --> 00:08:19.24
if you tell your kid, hey, no, it's a time for our family to get together.

213
00:08:19.24 --> 00:08:20.24
And you don't got to watch the game,

214
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:22.24
but hang out, we're going to have some hot dogs.

215
00:08:22.24 --> 00:08:23.24
Yeah.

216
00:08:23.24 --> 00:08:24.24
You know what I mean?

217
00:08:24.24 --> 00:08:25.24
And we're just, that's what it is.

218
00:08:25.24 --> 00:08:29.24
It's not about staring at the screen, watching something that you don't like.

219
00:08:29.24 --> 00:08:30.24
Yeah.

220
00:08:30.24 --> 00:08:32.24
It's about hanging out, you know, grandma's coming over,

221
00:08:32.24 --> 00:08:33.24
yeah.

222
00:08:33.24 --> 00:08:35.24
On teas coming over, we're going to cruise, we're going to eat,

223
00:08:35.24 --> 00:08:36.24
yeah.

224
00:08:36.24 --> 00:08:38.24
Barbara, keep chicken, right?

225
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:39.24
Yep.

226
00:08:39.24 --> 00:08:40.24
That's different.

227
00:08:40.24 --> 00:08:42.24
Then hey, you sit down and watch the football game.

228
00:08:42.24 --> 00:08:43.24
Yeah.

229
00:08:43.24 --> 00:08:45.24
But when kids reach a certain age, they don't want to hang out with you.

230
00:08:45.24 --> 00:08:46.24
First, certain time period.

231
00:08:46.24 --> 00:08:49.24
That's what started my whole argument right there.

232
00:08:49.24 --> 00:08:50.24
Yeah.

233
00:08:50.24 --> 00:08:52.24
Well, not it wasn't our argument, but that's what started my little discourse.

234
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:53.24
Yeah.

235
00:08:53.24 --> 00:08:57.24
And so, certain time period your children are supposed to rebel against you.

236
00:08:57.24 --> 00:08:58.24
Yeah.

237
00:08:58.24 --> 00:09:02.24
Somewhat, because they have to convince themselves and their mind that they,

238
00:09:02.24 --> 00:09:05.24
they, they're going to leave and they're going to be on their own.

239
00:09:05.24 --> 00:09:07.24
And, and something in their mind triggers that to be like,

240
00:09:07.24 --> 00:09:11.24
okay, I need to separate myself from these other humans that have been caring for me.

241
00:09:11.24 --> 00:09:11.24
Yeah.

242
00:09:11.24 --> 00:09:12.24
Because I was wearing diapers.

243
00:09:12.24 --> 00:09:13.24
Yeah.

244
00:09:13.24 --> 00:09:17.24
And now I need to get that out of my head and figure out how to survive on my own.

245
00:09:17.24 --> 00:09:20.24
So they, they do that by rebelging against you.

246
00:09:20.24 --> 00:09:22.24
And so, I don't want to see this stupid football game.

247
00:09:22.24 --> 00:09:24.24
I want to go to my friend Mary's house.

248
00:09:24.24 --> 00:09:25.24
Yeah.

249
00:09:25.24 --> 00:09:26.24
We're going to do something over there.

250
00:09:26.24 --> 00:09:27.24
Right?

251
00:09:27.24 --> 00:09:30.24
That's, you know, you think that there's an element of like a prayer.

252
00:09:30.24 --> 00:09:36.24
You know how like when you're a kid and you hit like 13, 12, 13 years old,

253
00:09:36.24 --> 00:09:39.24
you start to get this like empowered feeling, you know,

254
00:09:39.24 --> 00:09:41.24
because you're like physically kind of growing up.

255
00:09:41.24 --> 00:09:45.24
And then your parents are kind of, you have this feeling of oppression.

256
00:09:45.24 --> 00:09:46.24
Not that your parents are the problems.

257
00:09:46.24 --> 00:09:48.24
Things are totally, that's exactly what I'm saying.

258
00:09:48.24 --> 00:09:51.24
So you, I'm like, it's like an actual rebellion.

259
00:09:51.24 --> 00:09:53.24
You can oppress me no more.

260
00:09:53.24 --> 00:09:55.24
I don't have to ride with you.

261
00:09:55.24 --> 00:09:57.24
You know, I don't have to walk with you in the wall.

262
00:09:57.24 --> 00:09:59.24
No, I'm out.

263
00:09:59.24 --> 00:10:00.24
Yeah.

264
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:05.24
And you're trying to do that because you realize subconsciously that these people are not going to be here.

265
00:10:05.24 --> 00:10:07.24
I need to learn how to fend for myself.

266
00:10:07.24 --> 00:10:09.24
I need to get out of the nest.

267
00:10:09.24 --> 00:10:10.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:11.24
Get out of the nest.

269
00:10:11.24 --> 00:10:12.24
They're flapping them wings.

270
00:10:12.24 --> 00:10:13.24
But yeah.

271
00:10:13.24 --> 00:10:14.24
Exactly.

272
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:17.24
But the tradition, just for the sake of the tradition,

273
00:10:17.24 --> 00:10:23.24
because actually my whole argument with the lady was that he was trying to not necessarily prove,

274
00:10:23.24 --> 00:10:26.24
but try to find out whether or not she even thought about it.

275
00:10:26.24 --> 00:10:28.24
Like why you can make you do it.

276
00:10:28.24 --> 00:10:31.24
My point is that there are traditions that are important, right?

277
00:10:31.24 --> 00:10:33.24
With an family, with an culture.

278
00:10:33.24 --> 00:10:38.24
But if you lose fact, if you lose, if you don't understand the meaning of the tradition,

279
00:10:38.24 --> 00:10:40.24
yeah, then it doesn't make sense to you.

280
00:10:40.24 --> 00:10:41.24
Yeah.

281
00:10:41.24 --> 00:10:43.24
So then you don't care about it.

282
00:10:43.24 --> 00:10:44.24
Yeah.

283
00:10:44.24 --> 00:10:48.24
Look, this is our family, and this is when we get together this the only time.

284
00:10:48.24 --> 00:10:49.24
It's a tradition.

285
00:10:49.24 --> 00:10:50.24
Yes.

286
00:10:50.24 --> 00:10:51.24
So we're going to do it.

287
00:10:51.24 --> 00:10:52.24
And that way we get to know each other.

288
00:10:52.24 --> 00:10:54.24
And that way we keep connected.

289
00:10:54.24 --> 00:10:55.24
You know, we can help each other.

290
00:10:55.24 --> 00:10:56.24
Collision.

291
00:10:56.24 --> 00:10:57.24
Collision.

292
00:10:57.24 --> 00:11:00.24
Next question.

293
00:11:00.24 --> 00:11:05.24
Jockel, as a leader, at what point am I allowed to go to others and say,

294
00:11:05.24 --> 00:11:10.24
I need you because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing toward forward on my own.

295
00:11:10.24 --> 00:11:15.24
Or should that be an instance where I need to take a step back and apply more discipline to my life?

296
00:11:15.24 --> 00:11:17.24
Find a way to push forward by myself.

297
00:11:17.24 --> 00:11:18.24
Okay.

298
00:11:18.24 --> 00:11:23.24
You are allowed to say that to your team member immediately that you need them.

299
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:24.24
Absolutely.

300
00:11:24.24 --> 00:11:28.24
If you, of course, you need your team because if you didn't need your team, why would they be there?

301
00:11:28.24 --> 00:11:29.24
Yeah.

302
00:11:29.24 --> 00:11:32.24
If you, if you can do everything yourself, then you don't have a team.

303
00:11:32.24 --> 00:11:33.24
Yeah.

304
00:11:33.24 --> 00:11:34.24
Right?

305
00:11:34.24 --> 00:11:35.24
You just do everything yourself.

306
00:11:35.24 --> 00:11:39.24
So while you, of course, should be working already, you should be applying discipline.

307
00:11:39.24 --> 00:11:46.24
As a leader, it's your job to actually lead things and to let other people support and make things happen.

308
00:11:46.24 --> 00:11:47.24
And there's nothing wrong with that.

309
00:11:47.24 --> 00:11:51.24
And also, you don't want to be stuck in the weeds doing my new things.

310
00:11:51.24 --> 00:12:00.24
So if you're not capable, I think what might be holding this individual back.

311
00:12:00.24 --> 00:12:01.24
There's two things.

312
00:12:01.24 --> 00:12:05.24
Number one is I feel like I should take extreme ownership of everything.

313
00:12:05.24 --> 00:12:07.24
I feel like I should do everything myself.

314
00:12:07.24 --> 00:12:09.24
That is not what extreme ownership is.

315
00:12:09.24 --> 00:12:11.24
Extreme ownership isn't doing everything yourself.

316
00:12:11.24 --> 00:12:14.24
And also what can come into play is your ego.

317
00:12:14.24 --> 00:12:16.24
Because you don't want to ask people for help.

318
00:12:16.24 --> 00:12:18.24
And that's not a good sign.

319
00:12:18.24 --> 00:12:20.24
There's nothing wrong with asking people for help.

320
00:12:20.24 --> 00:12:23.24
If you need it, in fact, that's the humble thing to do.

321
00:12:23.24 --> 00:12:24.24
Hey, Echo.

322
00:12:24.24 --> 00:12:27.24
I don't know how to, quite finish out this, you know, this thing up.

323
00:12:27.24 --> 00:12:28.24
This project can work out.

324
00:12:28.24 --> 00:12:29.24
Can you give me a hand with this?

325
00:12:29.24 --> 00:12:31.24
I don't know how to work a video recorder.

326
00:12:31.24 --> 00:12:32.24
Can you show me how to do that?

327
00:12:32.24 --> 00:12:33.24
Right?

328
00:12:33.24 --> 00:12:34.24
Whatever.

329
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:37.24
So there's no problem with that. You're allowed to ask.

330
00:12:37.24 --> 00:12:38.24
You can, you can say that immediately.

331
00:12:38.24 --> 00:12:42.24
In fact, your team should feel that you are counting on them and relying on them.

332
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:43.24
They should know that.

333
00:12:43.24 --> 00:12:47.24
And then, but you're ego aside, ask for help.

334
00:12:47.24 --> 00:12:48.24
No problem.

335
00:12:48.24 --> 00:12:51.24
That doesn't mean you're giving away, that doesn't mean you're not taking ownership.

336
00:12:51.24 --> 00:12:52.24
That doesn't mean you're not applying discipline.

337
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:55.24
It means you're working as a team together to accomplish mission.

338
00:12:55.24 --> 00:12:58.24
Again, if a, if a, if a mission is so easily that you can accomplish it yourself,

339
00:12:58.24 --> 00:13:00.24
you don't need a team. Why do you have them?

340
00:13:00.24 --> 00:13:02.24
If you can do it all yourself just by applying discipline.

341
00:13:02.24 --> 00:13:03.24
Cool.

342
00:13:03.24 --> 00:13:04.24
You don't need anyone else.

343
00:13:04.24 --> 00:13:07.24
If your, but your mission should be larger than one human being,

344
00:13:07.24 --> 00:13:08.24
can accomplish.

345
00:13:08.24 --> 00:13:11.24
So that's why you have other people on board to help you out.

346
00:13:11.24 --> 00:13:11.24
Yeah.

347
00:13:11.24 --> 00:13:12.24
No problem.

348
00:13:12.24 --> 00:13:15.24
You know, like, I always think when, when that happens.

349
00:13:15.24 --> 00:13:17.24
I thought we made it out of that question.

350
00:13:17.24 --> 00:13:18.24
Go ahead.

351
00:13:18.24 --> 00:13:23.24
No, but you know, like, let's say it's like something that's just a pain in the ass.

352
00:13:23.24 --> 00:13:28.24
And you don't really need help, but you just don't want to do it by yourself.

353
00:13:28.24 --> 00:13:29.24
Oh, okay.

354
00:13:29.24 --> 00:13:30.24
We don't think.

355
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:31.24
Then yeah, then you gotta do that yourself.

356
00:13:31.24 --> 00:13:32.24
Yes.

357
00:13:32.24 --> 00:13:33.24
Yes.

358
00:13:33.24 --> 00:13:34.24
Yeah.

359
00:13:34.24 --> 00:13:35.24
Yeah.

360
00:13:35.24 --> 00:13:36.24
So that's kind of where this is coming from ultimately because it's like,

361
00:13:36.24 --> 00:13:42.24
I'm not saying that if you're the, if you're, if you have a position in a company,

362
00:13:42.24 --> 00:13:51.24
where you shouldn't be doing some sort of task because it's not financially efficient to have,

363
00:13:51.24 --> 00:13:56.24
you know, a person that's making a, a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year,

364
00:13:56.24 --> 00:14:00.24
doing a task that someone that's making ten dollars an hour should be doing.

365
00:14:00.24 --> 00:14:02.24
So, so you shouldn't do that.

366
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:05.24
That's not what I'm advocating and a company won't, won't be doing well.

367
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:06.24
Yeah.

368
00:14:06.24 --> 00:14:11.24
If you're paying people, $150,000 a year that you could get someone to do for ten dollars an hour.

369
00:14:11.24 --> 00:14:13.24
I'm not saying that.

370
00:14:13.24 --> 00:14:15.24
So don't get me wrong.

371
00:14:15.24 --> 00:14:16.24
Yeah.

372
00:14:16.24 --> 00:14:20.24
But that's why we have a team so that you can focus on going forward and whatever it is,

373
00:14:20.24 --> 00:14:24.24
you need to be focused on and somebody that's below you in the chain and command,

374
00:14:24.24 --> 00:14:28.24
that's a member of your team that's getting paid ten dollars an hour can do some of the stuff that you need him to do.

375
00:14:28.24 --> 00:14:29.24
Yeah.

376
00:14:29.24 --> 00:14:30.24
Yeah.

377
00:14:30.24 --> 00:14:35.24
And the question actually is, is really clear because it's because, quote unquote,

378
00:14:35.24 --> 00:14:40.24
because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing, you know, it's kind of like,

379
00:14:40.24 --> 00:14:42.24
it's obvious to you that you need help.

380
00:14:42.24 --> 00:14:44.24
It's not that you're, you know,

381
00:14:44.24 --> 00:14:47.24
raking leaves and I don't want to do this all by myself.

382
00:14:47.24 --> 00:14:51.24
So, hey, you know, you tell your brother come help me.

383
00:14:51.24 --> 00:14:53.24
It's not that it's different.

384
00:14:53.24 --> 00:14:54.24
Yeah.

385
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:58.24
And if you need to get the leaves raked and you need them done by Monday,

386
00:14:58.24 --> 00:15:03.24
so you can get them in the bags so that the dump truck can come and take the leaves away.

387
00:15:03.24 --> 00:15:05.24
And you can't physically get it done.

388
00:15:05.24 --> 00:15:07.24
Then you say to your brother, hey, can you give me hand?

389
00:15:07.24 --> 00:15:10.24
And you get these done tonight before the sun goes down.

390
00:15:10.24 --> 00:15:10.24
Yeah.

391
00:15:10.24 --> 00:15:11.24
I'm locking me up to make it in time.

392
00:15:11.24 --> 00:15:12.24
Can you give me a hand?

393
00:15:12.24 --> 00:15:13.24
Yeah.

394
00:15:13.24 --> 00:15:14.24
Your brother says absolutely.

395
00:15:14.24 --> 00:15:15.24
Oh, yeah.

396
00:15:15.24 --> 00:15:16.24
Got your back.

397
00:15:16.24 --> 00:15:19.24
Next wish.

398
00:15:19.24 --> 00:15:23.24
What's the best way to deal with feedback you don't agree with?

399
00:15:23.24 --> 00:15:27.24
My manager give, my manager gives me feedback on my personality.

400
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:30.24
That I don't agree with.

401
00:15:30.24 --> 00:15:36.24
I'm only in the company five months and he doesn't know enough about me to make the comments he's making.

402
00:15:36.24 --> 00:15:38.24
I find myself wanting,

403
00:15:38.24 --> 00:15:42.24
wanting to contest with what he's saying,

404
00:15:42.24 --> 00:15:45.24
but I believe this will ultimately end poorly for me.

405
00:15:45.24 --> 00:15:52.24
It's frustrating for me to listen to feedback from him about my personality when my friends and family would disagree with him.

406
00:15:52.24 --> 00:15:53.24
Okay.

407
00:15:53.24 --> 00:15:56.24
Again, this is one of those questions that I think people that will snap out.

408
00:15:56.24 --> 00:16:01.24
I think people that will snap out to know what the answer is, what you do when someone's giving you feedback.

409
00:16:01.24 --> 00:16:04.24
As you listen to it and you try and make adjustments.

410
00:16:04.24 --> 00:16:06.24
Get in their head and figure out where this is coming from.

411
00:16:06.24 --> 00:16:09.24
That they're obviously saying this for some reason.

412
00:16:09.24 --> 00:16:15.24
And maybe the reason is because they have a big ego or they don't understand people very well.

413
00:16:15.24 --> 00:16:16.24
And that's fine.

414
00:16:16.24 --> 00:16:18.24
And if you know that then you just learn something about them.

415
00:16:18.24 --> 00:16:23.24
But also you might not know yourself as well as you think you do.

416
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:28.24
And obviously if you contest with someone saying,

417
00:16:28.24 --> 00:16:30.24
you're going to look like you can't take critiques.

418
00:16:30.24 --> 00:16:31.24
So you're right.

419
00:16:31.24 --> 00:16:35.24
That's not a good approach to take furthermore.

420
00:16:35.24 --> 00:16:39.24
What you're saying is that your friends and family wouldn't agree with this guy.

421
00:16:39.24 --> 00:16:40.24
Well, guess what?

422
00:16:40.24 --> 00:16:42.24
They're your friends and family.

423
00:16:42.24 --> 00:16:43.24
Right?

424
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:48.24
It's like the dude's mom that, you know, the dude's mom always thinks the dude's handsome.

425
00:16:48.24 --> 00:16:49.24
Yeah.

426
00:16:49.24 --> 00:16:50.24
Dude's not handsome.

427
00:16:50.24 --> 00:16:54.24
But his mom thinks he's handsome and you know, your friends and family think,

428
00:16:54.24 --> 00:16:56.24
oh, I can't believe they'd say it about you.

429
00:16:56.24 --> 00:16:57.24
Well, that's your friends and family.

430
00:16:57.24 --> 00:17:00.24
There's a reason why you have friends because they like you.

431
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:00.24
Yeah.

432
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:06.24
Whatever personality is is not cool.

433
00:17:06.24 --> 00:17:07.24
They're over it.

434
00:17:07.24 --> 00:17:08.24
Yeah.

435
00:17:08.24 --> 00:17:09.24
They can deal with it.

436
00:17:09.24 --> 00:17:12.24
Well, this boss, the manager can't deal with it.

437
00:17:12.24 --> 00:17:13.24
He has no idea what they're doing.

438
00:17:13.24 --> 00:17:17.24
So like I said, when someone gives you critique,

439
00:17:17.24 --> 00:17:20.24
you should actually listen to what people have such a hard time with.

440
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:21.24
Yeah.

441
00:17:21.24 --> 00:17:25.24
And you should actually listen and say, okay, well, maybe I'm too aggressive.

442
00:17:25.24 --> 00:17:28.24
Maybe I'm too close minded.

443
00:17:28.24 --> 00:17:30.24
Whatever, whatever critique point you're getting.

444
00:17:30.24 --> 00:17:31.24
Listen to them.

445
00:17:31.24 --> 00:17:34.24
Maybe someone's like, hey, I don't think you take critique very well.

446
00:17:34.24 --> 00:17:36.24
And you're like, what are you talking about?

447
00:17:36.24 --> 00:17:37.24
Yeah.

448
00:17:37.24 --> 00:17:38.24
Of course I take critique well.

449
00:17:38.24 --> 00:17:39.24
You don't know.

450
00:17:39.24 --> 00:17:40.24
That's my point.

451
00:17:40.24 --> 00:17:43.24
So, and the other thing like I said is in doing this,

452
00:17:43.24 --> 00:17:46.24
the manager is actually telling you something about their personality.

453
00:17:46.24 --> 00:17:49.24
And their views and their judgment.

454
00:17:49.24 --> 00:17:51.24
So learn from that.

455
00:17:51.24 --> 00:17:54.24
Learn what they're, they're teaching you about their personality,

456
00:17:54.24 --> 00:18:03.24
which is going to help you better influence and manipulate and work with.

457
00:18:03.24 --> 00:18:05.24
Work with that person in the future.

458
00:18:05.24 --> 00:18:09.24
And perhaps help make them into a better leader at a better

459
00:18:09.24 --> 00:18:12.24
supporter of what it is that you're trying to do.

460
00:18:12.24 --> 00:18:16.24
So calm down relax.

461
00:18:16.24 --> 00:18:19.24
One of the best things you can do when someone says to you, hey, I think you're

462
00:18:19.24 --> 00:18:20.24
spooning stuff.

463
00:18:20.24 --> 00:18:21.24
Hold on.

464
00:18:21.24 --> 00:18:22.24
Let me grab a notebook.

465
00:18:22.24 --> 00:18:25.24
I just want to take notes and make sure I understand we're coming from

466
00:18:25.24 --> 00:18:26.24
so I can make some adjustments.

467
00:18:26.24 --> 00:18:28.24
I'm always looking to get better.

468
00:18:28.24 --> 00:18:29.24
Yeah.

469
00:18:29.24 --> 00:18:32.24
That might be a little extreme, but you know.

470
00:18:32.24 --> 00:18:33.24
Yeah.

471
00:18:33.24 --> 00:18:34.24
Hold on a second.

472
00:18:34.24 --> 00:18:35.24
Let me get my notebook.

473
00:18:35.24 --> 00:18:36.24
Yeah.

474
00:18:36.24 --> 00:18:38.24
So I can take notes because I want to get better.

475
00:18:38.24 --> 00:18:40.24
Well, I overdid that just a little bit.

476
00:18:40.24 --> 00:18:43.24
But not some people, some people they'll take notes.

477
00:18:43.24 --> 00:18:46.24
You know how like for you, but they like take taking notes.

478
00:18:46.24 --> 00:18:47.24
I feel good.

479
00:18:47.24 --> 00:18:52.24
When I was running the West Coast Seal training, the good officers,

480
00:18:52.24 --> 00:18:55.24
like there would be some officers when I'd be putting out work to them.

481
00:18:55.24 --> 00:18:56.24
They'd be taking notes.

482
00:18:56.24 --> 00:18:57.24
Yeah.

483
00:18:57.24 --> 00:19:00.24
And I was, you know, when I first saw it, it was kind of like,

484
00:19:00.24 --> 00:19:01.24
surprised me.

485
00:19:01.24 --> 00:19:02.24
Yeah.

486
00:19:02.24 --> 00:19:03.24
Okay.

487
00:19:03.24 --> 00:19:04.24
This guy's straight up taking notes.

488
00:19:04.24 --> 00:19:06.24
And what I'm telling is that one on one conversation,

489
00:19:06.24 --> 00:19:07.24
he's sending the like taking notes.

490
00:19:07.24 --> 00:19:08.24
Yeah.

491
00:19:08.24 --> 00:19:11.24
So, but if you said it with your tone, we like,

492
00:19:11.24 --> 00:19:12.24
Hold on.

493
00:19:12.24 --> 00:19:13.24
Oh, Joch was going to say something.

494
00:19:13.24 --> 00:19:14.24
And you get out my notebook.

495
00:19:14.24 --> 00:19:15.24
Oh, no.

496
00:19:15.24 --> 00:19:16.24
Yeah.

497
00:19:16.24 --> 00:19:17.24
That's sarcastic.

498
00:19:17.24 --> 00:19:17.24
Yeah.

499
00:19:17.24 --> 00:19:19.24
But there's also not just being sarcastic.

500
00:19:19.24 --> 00:19:22.24
I was leaning towards more like the brown noiser.

501
00:19:22.24 --> 00:19:23.24
Oh, that guy.

502
00:19:23.24 --> 00:19:24.24
Oh, echo.

503
00:19:24.24 --> 00:19:25.24
You're going to give me some feedback.

504
00:19:25.24 --> 00:19:26.24
Hold on one second.

505
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:27.24
I want to get my notes out.

506
00:19:27.24 --> 00:19:29.24
So I can make sure I do exactly what you're telling me to do.

507
00:19:29.24 --> 00:19:30.24
Thanks, buddy.

508
00:19:30.24 --> 00:19:30.24
Yeah.

509
00:19:30.24 --> 00:19:32.24
I see again with the tone.

510
00:19:32.24 --> 00:19:32.24
Yeah.

511
00:19:32.24 --> 00:19:33.24
I think, you know,

512
00:19:33.24 --> 00:19:34.24
tones that a little way.

513
00:19:34.24 --> 00:19:35.24
Middle ground.

514
00:19:35.24 --> 00:19:36.24
I think.

515
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:37.24
Yeah.

516
00:19:37.24 --> 00:19:38.24
I think pointed out on Twitter,

517
00:19:38.24 --> 00:19:41.24
something about tone and body language in some psychological

518
00:19:41.24 --> 00:19:42.24
survey makes up more than half of what it is actually being said.

519
00:19:42.24 --> 00:19:43.24
Yeah.

520
00:19:43.24 --> 00:19:44.24
And I heard that too.

521
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:46.24
And I was like, yeah, that sounds cool.

522
00:19:46.24 --> 00:19:48.24
But I mean, you know, maybe maybe not.

523
00:19:48.24 --> 00:19:50.24
Because if someone says something, it's pretty clear.

524
00:19:50.24 --> 00:19:52.24
But then I, it's kind of stuck with me.

525
00:19:52.24 --> 00:19:54.24
And it's true.

526
00:19:54.24 --> 00:19:56.24
Like, I could literally say the same, like, I don't know,

527
00:19:56.24 --> 00:19:59.24
10 words to you in all of the things that I've been doing.

528
00:19:59.24 --> 00:20:00.24
I think I've been doing it.

529
00:20:00.24 --> 00:20:03.24
I think pointed out on Twitter, something about tone and body language.

530
00:20:03.24 --> 00:20:04.24
In some psychological,

531
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:08.24
I say the same, like, I don't know, 10 words to you in all these different tones.

532
00:20:08.24 --> 00:20:09.24
And then it would mean 10 different things.

533
00:20:09.24 --> 00:20:10.24
Oh, for sure.

534
00:20:10.24 --> 00:20:12.24
Like, you can, like,

535
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:18.24
it's actually baffling and surprising how much we can actually communicate.

536
00:20:18.24 --> 00:20:21.24
Like, if I, if I make a joke to you, like something,

537
00:20:21.24 --> 00:20:23.24
you don't know my level of sarcasm.

538
00:20:23.24 --> 00:20:24.24
You don't know necessarily.

539
00:20:24.24 --> 00:20:26.24
You have to know the person, you know, like,

540
00:20:26.24 --> 00:20:29.24
so there's all these things that that have to be in place for you to effectively

541
00:20:29.24 --> 00:20:31.24
be communicated to.

542
00:20:31.24 --> 00:20:32.24
Yeah.

543
00:20:32.24 --> 00:20:36.24
Like, let's say you over here a conversation in the next room.

544
00:20:36.24 --> 00:20:39.24
Like, you could easily miss the whole point of the conversation,

545
00:20:39.24 --> 00:20:41.24
even though you heard every word.

546
00:20:41.24 --> 00:20:43.24
Because you don't know if they're joking, you don't know if they're serious,

547
00:20:43.24 --> 00:20:46.24
you don't know if one guy's mad, you know, if one guy's getting slid.

548
00:20:46.24 --> 00:20:49.24
And they can take the same exact, or they can say the same exact words,

549
00:20:49.24 --> 00:20:51.24
but they're just saying different things coming from different places.

550
00:20:51.24 --> 00:20:52.24
Yeah.

551
00:20:52.24 --> 00:20:54.24
That's where you end up a lot of communication problems with the email,

552
00:20:54.24 --> 00:20:56.24
where someone emails a joke,

553
00:20:56.24 --> 00:20:57.24
yeah.

554
00:20:57.24 --> 00:20:59.24
Joking about something and then someone takes it seriously.

555
00:20:59.24 --> 00:21:00.24
And next thing, you know,

556
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:02.24
people are flying off the handle.

557
00:21:02.24 --> 00:21:03.24
Yeah.

558
00:21:03.24 --> 00:21:06.24
I always had that rule in my seal battoons and task duty.

559
00:21:06.24 --> 00:21:08.24
You weren't allowed to joke on the radio.

560
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:08.24
Yeah.

561
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:10.24
And the main reason for that rules,

562
00:21:10.24 --> 00:21:14.24
because you don't want other people outside your organization to hear it

563
00:21:14.24 --> 00:21:16.24
and take it the wrong way, same thing.

564
00:21:16.24 --> 00:21:18.24
But it's the same thing with email.

565
00:21:18.24 --> 00:21:21.24
You must know someone really, really, really well.

566
00:21:21.24 --> 00:21:24.24
You better, it's better to keep the sarcastic comments

567
00:21:24.24 --> 00:21:28.24
and just be straightforward and speak plainly

568
00:21:28.24 --> 00:21:31.24
with your email and your communicate with people.

569
00:21:31.24 --> 00:21:32.24
It's a lot easier.

570
00:21:32.24 --> 00:21:34.24
And then even with that,

571
00:21:34.24 --> 00:21:36.24
it's not escaped from this.

572
00:21:36.24 --> 00:21:40.24
Even with that, you could easily come off as like two rigid or two.

573
00:21:40.24 --> 00:21:41.24
Or it's like,

574
00:21:41.24 --> 00:21:42.24
Dang, is this guy, does this guy not like me?

575
00:21:42.24 --> 00:21:42.24
Yeah.

576
00:21:42.24 --> 00:21:44.24
You know, like a jerk, that's your second email.

577
00:21:44.24 --> 00:21:47.24
And he's like, that's why communication is important.

578
00:21:47.24 --> 00:21:51.24
That's why learning how to write well is important.

579
00:21:51.24 --> 00:21:53.24
That's why little words that you put in matter.

580
00:21:53.24 --> 00:21:54.24
Yeah.

581
00:21:54.24 --> 00:21:56.24
And it in the phrases and the sentences.

582
00:21:56.24 --> 00:21:57.24
They matter.

583
00:21:57.24 --> 00:21:58.24
They're like different.

584
00:21:58.24 --> 00:22:01.24
Thus the invention of emojis.

585
00:22:01.24 --> 00:22:04.24
Well, I think you think the emoji.

586
00:22:04.24 --> 00:22:06.24
Yeah, no, you're very into emojis.

587
00:22:06.24 --> 00:22:07.24
I am now.

588
00:22:07.24 --> 00:22:08.24
Yeah.

589
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:13.24
I sometimes I, I must say that I think you communicate very well

590
00:22:13.24 --> 00:22:18.24
with emojis because even though you don't sometimes use

591
00:22:18.24 --> 00:22:20.24
new words and attacks to me,

592
00:22:20.24 --> 00:22:25.24
I fully understand what you mean by lightning bolt,

593
00:22:25.24 --> 00:22:26.24
lightning bolt, lightning bolt,

594
00:22:26.24 --> 00:22:29.24
rainbow, lightning bolt, thumbs up,

595
00:22:29.24 --> 00:22:30.24
shock up fire.

596
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:31.24
Shock up fire.

597
00:22:31.24 --> 00:22:32.24
Shock up fire.

598
00:22:32.24 --> 00:22:33.24
Yep.

599
00:22:33.24 --> 00:22:34.24
Very clear, right?

600
00:22:34.24 --> 00:22:35.24
Yeah.

601
00:22:35.24 --> 00:22:36.24
No, I agree.

602
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:37.24
Yeah.

603
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:38.24
I agree with that.

604
00:22:38.24 --> 00:22:39.24
Shock up fire.

605
00:22:39.24 --> 00:22:40.24
I forgot about fire.

606
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:41.24
You do quite a bit of fire.

607
00:22:41.24 --> 00:22:42.24
Yeah.

608
00:22:42.24 --> 00:22:43.24
The lightning bolt and fire,

609
00:22:43.24 --> 00:22:45.24
I use them in the shock up for sure.

610
00:22:45.24 --> 00:22:47.24
And the rainbow with you, I use the rainbow a lot.

611
00:22:47.24 --> 00:22:49.24
Is it going to lighten up the moon?

612
00:22:49.24 --> 00:22:53.24
What it helps, it seems like a child thing.

613
00:22:53.24 --> 00:22:55.24
I don't like emoticons.

614
00:22:55.24 --> 00:22:56.24
I don't like emojis.

615
00:22:56.24 --> 00:22:57.24
Yeah.

616
00:22:57.24 --> 00:22:59.24
But you're kind of like that in real life too.

617
00:22:59.24 --> 00:23:02.24
No, I know, but it seems like to me it's see.

618
00:23:02.24 --> 00:23:03.24
Yeah.

619
00:23:03.24 --> 00:23:06.24
It's like a kid, maybe your little daughter would do it or something.

620
00:23:06.24 --> 00:23:07.24
Yeah.

621
00:23:07.24 --> 00:23:11.24
It's what my daughter will send me 875 emojis from my wife's phone.

622
00:23:11.24 --> 00:23:12.24
Yeah.

623
00:23:12.24 --> 00:23:12.24
Yeah.

624
00:23:12.24 --> 00:23:14.24
All of them see if she can film me.

625
00:23:14.24 --> 00:23:15.24
Yeah.

626
00:23:15.24 --> 00:23:16.24
And I send back.

627
00:23:16.24 --> 00:23:17.24
Okay.

628
00:23:17.24 --> 00:23:17.24
Yeah.

629
00:23:17.24 --> 00:23:17.24
Yeah.

630
00:23:17.24 --> 00:23:18.24
Yeah.

631
00:23:18.24 --> 00:23:19.24
Yeah.

632
00:23:19.24 --> 00:23:20.24
Yeah.

633
00:23:20.24 --> 00:23:21.24
Yeah.

634
00:23:21.24 --> 00:23:22.24
I love it.

635
00:23:22.24 --> 00:23:36.24
If you know that you're running the risk of something too, like you know like stoic or whatever, you know, like if you if you have to answer question with yes when in whatever the question is, it's a yes or no question and you answer yes affirmatively right.

636
00:23:36.24 --> 00:23:39.24
You'll put yes period and that'll come off as like.

637
00:23:39.24 --> 00:23:40.24
Aw, chocolates like.

638
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:41.24
I don't know what up with this guy.

639
00:23:41.24 --> 00:23:43.24
I'm serious or something.

640
00:23:43.24 --> 00:23:45.24
You know, instead of yes,

641
00:23:45.24 --> 00:23:48.44
Yeah, it's two exclamation points lightning volt fire

642
00:23:48.44 --> 00:23:53.04
Limbo or something like that that gives away a little bit more like you know you're just like yes

643
00:23:53.04 --> 00:23:55.32
As if you're just looking someone in their eye

644
00:23:55.32 --> 00:23:59.96
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. You're like that in real life

645
00:24:02.04 --> 00:24:08.28
Most of the time right on anyway lightning bolt fire. Yeah, man. Let's see emojis don't

646
00:24:08.28 --> 00:24:11.28
In there don't overdo it double shocker double shocker. Yeah

647
00:24:11.28 --> 00:24:16.64
What's the highest level of a moji approval you can send me

648
00:24:18.04 --> 00:24:22.88
Three lightning bolts three fires three shockers three rain most

649
00:24:24.72 --> 00:24:26.72
For sure

650
00:24:27.36 --> 00:24:32.64
You know four it's like that's too much like you shouldn't do four for his die-mirty, you know

651
00:24:33.84 --> 00:24:37.76
Oh, plus depends on what I say though. So like if there's if it's a word

652
00:24:37.76 --> 00:24:39.76
Oh

653
00:24:39.76 --> 00:24:44.72
The vowel in the word will they'll be like that that can be infinite

654
00:24:44.72 --> 00:24:49.36
Or what do you like if I put I don't know you know like you'll tell me something exciting and I'll put on an all put

655
00:24:49.36 --> 00:24:51.84
Dang instead of DANG I'll put D

656
00:24:53.12 --> 00:24:55.12
Lorkace a

657
00:24:55.12 --> 00:24:57.12
Debending level of excitement a

658
00:24:58.16 --> 00:25:03.44
That can go infinitely by the way that can spend 20 text messages even over 20 days

659
00:25:03.44 --> 00:25:09.84
And that's how infinite it can be then the first half of the is in lower case the second half of the is are upper case the N

660
00:25:10.24 --> 00:25:11.60
Maybe 10 ends

661
00:25:11.60 --> 00:25:17.92
PG's all capital then you know then so it depends it just depends

662
00:25:18.64 --> 00:25:19.60
But yes, well

663
00:25:19.60 --> 00:25:21.60
Like I said I think you communicate well

664
00:25:21.60 --> 00:25:27.12
But yeah, that sounds on a series note in regards to communication that is effective

665
00:25:27.44 --> 00:25:32.80
You know what I mean you can sense my level of excitement as opposed to cool period

666
00:25:32.80 --> 00:25:35.52
Yeah, no, no, you're you were

667
00:25:36.56 --> 00:25:38.40
You're playing with that real quick

668
00:25:44.40 --> 00:25:46.40
Oh, that's funny

669
00:25:46.40 --> 00:25:48.40
I like

670
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Anyway

671
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.48
Next question if you are ready

672
00:25:55.84 --> 00:25:57.52
Sorry, I'm not all good

673
00:25:57.52 --> 00:26:01.68
I'm gonna good mood. I guess yeah the rainbow of mine

674
00:26:03.68 --> 00:26:05.68
That's nice

675
00:26:07.20 --> 00:26:08.72
Darius jacco speaking of

676
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.48
Lighthearted nice emotions

677
00:26:12.88 --> 00:26:15.28
Darius jacco you just get before

678
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:23.52
Okay, my my my my my okay jacco what is the difference between extreme ownership versus the easy button

679
00:26:23.52 --> 00:26:30.88
Can you elaborate I just need a little more clarification to connect the dots in my situation okay again

680
00:26:32.16 --> 00:26:37.52
So as a leader yes, of course you are supposed to take ownership of everything extreme ownership of everything

681
00:26:37.60 --> 00:26:39.60
That's what we talk about all the time

682
00:26:40.24 --> 00:26:42.24
But does this mean

683
00:26:42.48 --> 00:26:50.32
That you say I will do this and I will do that and I will do the other thing and I will do everything that the team is supposed to be doing

684
00:26:50.32 --> 00:26:53.44
No, that's that's not what I'm talking about now ownership does mean

685
00:26:53.44 --> 00:26:55.44
That you get things done

686
00:26:55.92 --> 00:27:03.76
You are responsible for making sure things get done that's what ownership is it is our team is in charge of something if our team is in charge of a project and

687
00:27:04.48 --> 00:27:08.64
And we don't get it done it's my fault. It's not anybody else's fault

688
00:27:09.12 --> 00:27:12.72
So that's that's what it is it means you take responsibility when things go wrong

689
00:27:12.72 --> 00:27:16.96
It means you take responsibility for problems and you get them fixed that's definitely ownership

690
00:27:16.96 --> 00:27:23.68
Now the easy button and when I talk about the easy button in a negative way because that's what I'm doing here

691
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:26.48
It's when your subordinates come to you and say

692
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.84
How should I do this or or what's the best way to execute this or can you

693
00:27:33.20 --> 00:27:37.20
Can you tell me a good plan on on how we should make this happen or even

694
00:27:38.08 --> 00:27:41.12
Hey, there's bad news can you come tell my people

695
00:27:41.12 --> 00:27:47.68
Because I don't really want to do it now if you say yes to those types of things on a regular basis

696
00:27:48.48 --> 00:27:55.60
Then what you're doing is you're actually you're actually stunting the growth of your subordinate leader because instead when you come to me and you say

697
00:27:56.24 --> 00:28:00.32
Hey, Jocke we got this mentioned we got a plan. How do you think we should do it if I say okay?

698
00:28:00.32 --> 00:28:04.64
We should come in from the north you should you know set up over watch position here you should move through the target from this direction

699
00:28:05.04 --> 00:28:08.96
You you didn't learn anything you just took what I told you and said I say

700
00:28:08.96 --> 00:28:12.48
Go come up with your best plan and come back to me and brief me on it and so now

701
00:28:13.04 --> 00:28:16.32
You might be kind of bummed out because you wanted you didn't have one half to do this extra work

702
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:21.60
But now you got to go do the extra work, but now you're learning and in two or three times you're not even coming to ask me anymore

703
00:28:21.60 --> 00:28:26.000
You're gonna come with a plan and because we already did a psycholopter cycle of you say hey

704
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Here's my plan and we say hey make this adjustment and you come back next time you say here's my plan

705
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.40
I say make this little adjustment and eventually you know to make those adjustments on your own and now you can do it by yourself

706
00:28:34.40 --> 00:28:40.88
And that's what we want I don't want to stunt the growth of my subordinate leaders so I don't want to be an

707
00:28:41.76 --> 00:28:43.76
Easy button

708
00:28:43.76 --> 00:28:48.20
So you're providing the easy button like that's what they're talking about when they see easy button

709
00:28:48.20 --> 00:28:52.44
Yeah, if you want to be that you don't want to be easy button for everybody else and I also

710
00:28:53.28 --> 00:28:57.24
No one's gonna be able to take your job from you which is actually what you want you want

711
00:28:57.24 --> 00:29:01.20
I want to make every one of my subordinate so good that they can take my job from me that means

712
00:29:01.20 --> 00:29:09.12
I can step up and look forward and look out and they can do a better job of handling what they've got a handle and eventually when it's my time to get promoted

713
00:29:09.12 --> 00:29:12.40
I got people to take my place and we're all good

714
00:29:12.96 --> 00:29:18.56
Of course that doesn't mean leave them blind or let them fail don't do that give you want to give them rope

715
00:29:20.32 --> 00:29:22.32
But you don't give them enough rope to hang themselves

716
00:29:22.96 --> 00:29:28.94
You give them enough rope that they maybe get a little not in the rope and it gives a little bit sloppy and you and then you go over to me

717
00:29:28.94 --> 00:29:33.14
Say it's not here. Let me help you get that on tide and now you give them the rope again

718
00:29:33.42 --> 00:29:36.86
So you don't you know in in a in the military

719
00:29:37.42 --> 00:29:42.82
You don't let someone go do a mission that's real where someone's gonna get hurt killed or a mission failure

720
00:29:43.10 --> 00:29:47.62
Because you wanted to not be the easy button. No. You don't do that in the civilian sector

721
00:29:47.62 --> 00:29:54.78
You don't let someone lose a big client or lose a bunch of money or make a mistake that costs a bunch of capital because you didn't want to be the easy button

722
00:29:54.78 --> 00:29:57.82
No, no, I'm now might you let someone make a little mistake

723
00:29:57.82 --> 00:30:02.38
Sure little mistake that costs them a little bit of money. Sure. So they learn a lesson sure

724
00:30:02.62 --> 00:30:07.12
But you know what I'm following your place. You don't let them hang your hang themselves. So that's that

725
00:30:10.30 --> 00:30:12.30
Next question

726
00:30:12.94 --> 00:30:14.30
Dearest

727
00:30:14.30 --> 00:30:15.58
Jocco a

728
00:30:16.06 --> 00:30:21.98
Question for you in the podcast our fire department promotion process has role playing scenarios

729
00:30:21.98 --> 00:30:27.82
And those role playing scenarios I lose points because I'm not outwardly passionate corner quote, you know

730
00:30:28.94 --> 00:30:35.86
I would have to fake it to succeed and I'm not a fake person is this worth it to fake it when seeking promotion

731
00:30:36.50 --> 00:30:39.50
It's not like I'm gonna fake it once I attain the promotion

732
00:30:40.14 --> 00:30:43.10
Okay, this is a very cool question

733
00:30:43.10 --> 00:30:47.66
This question a lot and actually on this guy sent me this question on Facebook. I responded

734
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:56.46
Very quickly and simply my response was play the game. Yeah, so fake it play the game

735
00:30:57.50 --> 00:31:05.02
And and you know what he wrote back got it. Yeah, so good for him. Yeah, because what everybody I think thinks I'm gonna say is that no

736
00:31:05.02 --> 00:31:11.98
You think yourself no, you don't play the game. You're not gonna get up there and act all passionate about stuff. You're you your hard court no

737
00:31:11.98 --> 00:31:17.62
Yeah, play the game now you because you what you're doing you play the game. You you want to do a good job

738
00:31:17.62 --> 00:31:23.86
And you're doing your job and doing your job doing any job requires some level of

739
00:31:24.46 --> 00:31:29.86
Faking it. Yeah, now does this mean that you're a fake person? No, it means that you're trying to do a good job

740
00:31:31.58 --> 00:31:39.94
Think if every time that your boss came in with a dumb idea and you your reaction was to say that's a dumb idea

741
00:31:39.94 --> 00:31:41.94
Yeah

742
00:31:41.94 --> 00:31:47.12
Is that gonna get you anywhere or every time a customer had an idiot idiot idiot idiotic complaint about something

743
00:31:47.12 --> 00:31:49.12
You were like hey you're an idiot

744
00:31:49.12 --> 00:31:53.12
Yeah, or every time your life said

745
00:31:54.42 --> 00:32:03.46
You know, is this chicken dry and you said it's drier than a piece of cardboard and the Sahara Desert is that is that?

746
00:32:03.46 --> 00:32:10.72
You know, would you would you benefit from that? How would that work out? You would he would not work out?

747
00:32:10.72 --> 00:32:20.94
Well in any of those cases you have to play the game. Yeah have to play the game and I know I know that that's hard and

748
00:32:22.22 --> 00:32:27.84
I'll tell you what I did to get myself over playing the game

749
00:32:27.84 --> 00:32:35.84
I turned it into a game in my head. I was like I'm I'm gonna build a relationship with this boss that I don't like

750
00:32:36.24 --> 00:32:41.90
I'm gonna do it. Yeah, I'm gonna build the best relay. That's my game. I'm gonna become this guy's bro, right?

751
00:32:42.40 --> 00:32:44.40
When I was at Officer Canada school

752
00:32:44.72 --> 00:32:47.76
You gotta do the most ridiculous rules

753
00:32:48.56 --> 00:32:52.92
They have these these rules that you've got to follow that were really annoying

754
00:32:52.92 --> 00:32:57.56
And you know what I did I executed the rules

755
00:32:58.52 --> 00:33:05.04
Hurger and more stringently than than anybody thought was even remotely necessary and had fun with it

756
00:33:05.04 --> 00:33:06.04
I

757
00:33:06.04 --> 00:33:08.04
Played that game I

758
00:33:09.04 --> 00:33:11.48
You know if I've got a peer that may be

759
00:33:12.76 --> 00:33:16.56
Competing with or there's some tension. I'm gonna support them. I'm gonna play the game

760
00:33:16.56 --> 00:33:20.56
That's what I'm saying. You got to play the game now. Does this make me a bad person or a fake person?

761
00:33:20.56 --> 00:33:27.02
No, why because you're doing this the reason you're playing the game the reason you're acting this way is

762
00:33:27.52 --> 00:33:30.000
For benevolent reasons

763
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.44
Right this this guy at the fire department. He's not

764
00:33:34.24 --> 00:33:39.16
Trying to get promoted so that he can you serve the powers and then take over no

765
00:33:39.68 --> 00:33:44.80
He's trying to get into a position where he can better lead and serve and and

766
00:33:44.80 --> 00:33:51.54
Step up and raise young leaders underneath him. That's what you're trying to do you're not trying to sneak into a position

767
00:33:51.54 --> 00:33:53.68
You don't deserve and you're not trying to build relationships

768
00:33:53.68 --> 00:33:59.08
So you can take advantage of people for your own benefit that that would be a fake person

769
00:33:59.08 --> 00:34:02.48
Yeah, in my opinion you're trying to move

770
00:34:02.48 --> 00:34:09.02
But if you're trying to move up and rank so you can do better and you can take care of the troops and you can increase readiness

771
00:34:09.02 --> 00:34:15.58
There's nothing wrong with that and if you don't play the game to set some level

772
00:34:16.46 --> 00:34:22.26
You're not gonna get promoted and guess what then people that played the game that might be less

773
00:34:23.18 --> 00:34:30.38
Less qualified to do that job. They're gonna get the job because you wouldn't play the game your two stubborn your ego is too big

774
00:34:31.10 --> 00:34:34.10
So you got to put that aside and I'll tell you something else

775
00:34:34.10 --> 00:34:37.78
Learn from what you're being told if

776
00:34:39.46 --> 00:34:46.34
If you're showing no passion if you're showing like a zero motion that's bad people will not connect with you

777
00:34:47.22 --> 00:34:49.22
And if they don't connect with you

778
00:34:50.90 --> 00:34:56.18
They don't follow you if they don't connect with you. You're not building relationships with people if you don't have relationships with people

779
00:34:56.34 --> 00:34:58.34
You don't have a good team

780
00:34:58.90 --> 00:34:59.94
So

781
00:34:59.94 --> 00:35:04.50
Show a little bit of passion sometimes you got to fake it. That's fine. You're just a really

782
00:35:04.50 --> 00:35:07.34
Unpassionate person cool show a little bit of passion

783
00:35:07.82 --> 00:35:09.50
Fake it a little bit

784
00:35:09.50 --> 00:35:12.42
Learn it a little bit because it's actually gonna be beneficial

785
00:35:12.42 --> 00:35:16.18
I would love for you to fake it for a little while until you start caring

786
00:35:16.42 --> 00:35:18.42
What like what are you not passionate about?

787
00:35:18.74 --> 00:35:21.14
Are you not passionate about the job?

788
00:35:21.14 --> 00:35:27.74
Are you not passionate about your firefighter about saving people's lives? Are you not passionate about having a square-to-weight apartment?

789
00:35:27.74 --> 00:35:32.62
You of course you're passionate about that stuff otherwise you wouldn't be you wouldn't be sending me a message saying hey

790
00:35:32.62 --> 00:35:36.06
How do I get advanced? How do I do better? Yeah, you are passionate about it

791
00:35:36.70 --> 00:35:38.70
And that's fine. It's good. Um

792
00:35:39.90 --> 00:35:44.94
I say it all the time, you know if you don't have any emotions that you're a robot and robots people don't follow robots

793
00:35:45.26 --> 00:35:49.58
So sometimes you got to show a little bit of that emotion and passion to

794
00:35:50.30 --> 00:35:55.10
Connect with people that's okay. Yeah, don't be scared. Hold me. Yeah, don't be scared. No

795
00:35:55.10 --> 00:36:00.14
Yeah, because that's really the thing right is showing it. Of course you're passionate about but showing it

796
00:36:00.14 --> 00:36:02.70
There's different people there something right and I dig it

797
00:36:02.70 --> 00:36:08.86
I don't always be like showing how fired up I am all the time or whatever in whatever scenario whatever

798
00:36:09.18 --> 00:36:11.18
But you're right that does help

799
00:36:11.18 --> 00:36:13.42
Yeah, like when you want something exciting about it

800
00:36:13.42 --> 00:36:15.58
It's and there's a there's a dichotomy here

801
00:36:15.58 --> 00:36:20.70
Yeah, because there's some people that will show too much emotions. Yeah, and there's some people that will not show enough

802
00:36:20.94 --> 00:36:23.58
So you want to be somewhere balanced in the middle. Yeah

803
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:24.70
Yeah

804
00:36:24.70 --> 00:36:32.22
Yeah, it's true and I dig it to when because it does feel like faking it because like in football the tradition is like to be fired up on the sidelines

805
00:36:32.22 --> 00:36:37.50
Let's go let's go, we know like that can but probably sometimes you know have the energy for that

806
00:36:37.50 --> 00:36:40.62
Sometimes you're kind of just nervous and you want to focus on what you got to do or whatever

807
00:36:40.62 --> 00:36:46.46
You know, but it's kind of part of the game, you know and and it does help the people around you too

808
00:36:46.78 --> 00:36:51.26
It's like okay, he's fired up. Okay, maybe I'm not fired up now, but he's kind of getting me fired up

809
00:36:51.26 --> 00:36:56.86
You know and it kind of like helps the team yeah, but yeah, so yeah, sometimes it doesn't feel like comfortable to do

810
00:36:57.74 --> 00:37:02.62
Express outwardly, you know, how passionate what it helps plus is fake like faking it

811
00:37:02.62 --> 00:37:08.06
That's like a framing thing too, you know, like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you frame it like you're faking it versus how you said you're playing the game

812
00:37:08.06 --> 00:37:10.70
Right, you're playing the game because you want to do a better job

813
00:37:10.70 --> 00:37:14.22
Yeah, you want to get promoted. You want to get promoted for the right reasons. Yeah

814
00:37:14.70 --> 00:37:20.94
There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah, that's that. Yeah. That's good. I think if you can kind of bend and stretch yourself in an uncomfortable way

815
00:37:20.94 --> 00:37:26.06
For the end of it, you know, you know, I think where people I think that term of faking it

816
00:37:27.26 --> 00:37:33.26
No one wants to be a fake person right, yes, which which is why you're correct in that the way that's framed

817
00:37:34.38 --> 00:37:36.70
Is I'm being a fake person and

818
00:37:37.82 --> 00:37:40.30
No one wants to be a fake person yeah

819
00:37:40.94 --> 00:37:42.94
At the same time

820
00:37:43.50 --> 00:37:45.50
You have to

821
00:37:45.50 --> 00:37:53.02
Grow and you have to adjust and if you're gonna be in a leadership position you're gonna do things that you don't

822
00:37:54.06 --> 00:37:56.70
That you wouldn't have man. I do that all the time

823
00:37:57.98 --> 00:38:01.82
I mean what I was in a military you know, I worked with people that I you know I've said this before

824
00:38:01.82 --> 00:38:07.82
I go I work with people both belomian the chain command and above me in the chain command that I despise

825
00:38:09.02 --> 00:38:11.50
They never knew it. They don't know who they are right now

826
00:38:11.50 --> 00:38:13.50
Dang

827
00:38:14.70 --> 00:38:20.30
But you know, you got it. Is that make me a fake person? No makes me a professional

828
00:38:20.62 --> 00:38:25.50
Makes me a professional doing my job because I wasn't gonna get let some little personal emotion in mine or some

829
00:38:25.82 --> 00:38:31.58
Oh, that guy's does this and I don't like that so I'm not gonna like him and and now we have an adversary relationship and now I

830
00:38:32.22 --> 00:38:35.98
But got a problem. Yeah, no. I'm playing the game play the game

831
00:38:35.98 --> 00:38:41.58
So what's the line what is the fake person genuinely? Well

832
00:38:42.30 --> 00:38:45.66
I was gonna as you asked me what the line is the line is if you go against what your principles are

833
00:38:46.30 --> 00:38:50.94
You know, so if you've got fundamental principles that they say oh if you want this job

834
00:38:50.94 --> 00:38:52.94
But what we need to do is

835
00:38:54.14 --> 00:38:56.14
Fill out a report about Billy

836
00:38:57.02 --> 00:38:59.90
Saying that he did something wrong that you know he didn't do wrong

837
00:38:59.90 --> 00:39:05.74
Hmm, right then you go no I'm not gonna do that that that that's what that's bad, right?

838
00:39:06.06 --> 00:39:08.06
That's not now you're not just playing the game

839
00:39:08.54 --> 00:39:14.54
Now you're going against your principles of being an honest person about what's happening. Yeah, that's really what it is

840
00:39:14.54 --> 00:39:17.02
Right like the honesty when you're a fake person

841
00:39:17.02 --> 00:39:22.38
So like if someone's like oh I'm faking it or I'm being a fake person. I said a fake person

842
00:39:23.26 --> 00:39:28.78
Like turning on some passion some manufactured passion for the sake of the team and stuff like that that doesn't feel like

843
00:39:28.78 --> 00:39:33.98
You're a fake person the fake person is kind of like you'll sit like someone I don't know for example someone's in the room and you're like hey

844
00:39:34.14 --> 00:39:37.18
You're great that sure it looks great and you're doing a great job

845
00:39:37.18 --> 00:39:45.34
They leave and we like like sucks right bad the reason I'll tell you the difference the reason that someone the reason that you would consider someone and be angry that someone's a fake person is when they are doing it

846
00:39:45.50 --> 00:39:48.14
Because they're doing it for personal benefit

847
00:39:48.70 --> 00:39:50.06
They're they're saying

848
00:39:50.06 --> 00:39:53.98
They're like if if if you were my boss and

849
00:39:54.70 --> 00:39:57.34
I come in and I say hey, I go

850
00:39:57.34 --> 00:39:59.74
I really like your new haircut looks great

851
00:40:00.86 --> 00:40:02.54
I don't really think that

852
00:40:02.54 --> 00:40:06.62
Your haircut looks dumb, but I'm gonna say that anyways and everyone knows that all I want to do is get that next promotion

853
00:40:07.34 --> 00:40:09.98
That's being fake. Yeah, that's being fake

854
00:40:11.18 --> 00:40:16.70
But if I'm saying well, because one of my really doing what I'm doing is I'm I'm making an adaptation

855
00:40:17.26 --> 00:40:18.54
I'm glowing

856
00:40:18.54 --> 00:40:21.74
I'm I'm doing something that I'm uncomfortable with

857
00:40:22.22 --> 00:40:24.22
Because I know it's gonna make me a better leader

858
00:40:24.22 --> 00:40:27.66
Hmm well, that's what I should be doing is trying to become a better leader

859
00:40:28.78 --> 00:40:34.46
Now again if that if if in this whatever organization what you have to do is

860
00:40:35.82 --> 00:40:38.22
Is do something that you don't agree with

861
00:40:40.06 --> 00:40:42.06
And it's it's the wrong thing to do

862
00:40:43.26 --> 00:40:47.34
And you do it anyways well, then then that's that's that's almost a totally different thing

863
00:40:47.34 --> 00:40:50.30
There's that then there's hey, I'm gonna kiss ass

864
00:40:50.30 --> 00:41:00.10
Right, so that I get promoted. It's all about me and that's probably the what we think of the definition of a fake person yeah

865
00:41:02.94 --> 00:41:04.94
Guys

866
00:41:06.86 --> 00:41:08.86
Next question I

867
00:41:09.18 --> 00:41:11.82
Saw a weakness in you

868
00:41:12.62 --> 00:41:17.98
On your latest podcast you seem to overlook the fact that some infant children were raised in

869
00:41:17.98 --> 00:41:22.22
Undiscipline environments with undiscipline parents they grow up having

870
00:41:23.42 --> 00:41:29.34
Modeled these undiscipline examples. I hate the fact that I have gross undiscipline behavior

871
00:41:29.82 --> 00:41:34.94
Solving this is a major priority in my life you have zero idea of what it of what this

872
00:41:34.94 --> 00:41:40.62
Experiences like for me you seem blind to this struggle like a father who would ignore their child's struggle

873
00:41:40.62 --> 00:41:48.70
And offer only the words manna so

874
00:41:49.26 --> 00:41:52.06
This is a good question and I see where

875
00:41:52.86 --> 00:42:00.38
This guy's coming from for sure and I know that it can be very very frustrating to try and become

876
00:42:01.18 --> 00:42:06.78
Discipline and I apologize that I haven't talked about the fact of of what to do

877
00:42:06.78 --> 00:42:11.50
If you come from an undiscipline family or you have undisciplined parents

878
00:42:11.50 --> 00:42:18.94
I haven't really talked about what to do in that situation, but there's a reason that I haven't talked about that before and that is because you don't get

879
00:42:19.34 --> 00:42:21.34
Discipline from your parents

880
00:42:23.18 --> 00:42:28.74
You don't get discipline from your parents from your grandparents from your older brothers and sisters

881
00:42:28.74 --> 00:42:32.58
You don't get discipline from an external source

882
00:42:32.58 --> 00:42:40.42
You have to get it from you that's what self discipline is you get it from yourself you get it from you

883
00:42:41.86 --> 00:42:43.86
so

884
00:42:44.10 --> 00:42:48.74
There's people from every possible background

885
00:42:49.54 --> 00:42:57.06
From no parents to crazy parents to you know drug addicted parents to

886
00:42:57.06 --> 00:43:04.74
Super square to way parents and every where in between on that spectrum that are completely disciplined people

887
00:43:05.54 --> 00:43:08.26
more disciplined than anyone I know

888
00:43:09.94 --> 00:43:15.70
It doesn't come from your parents. You don't inherit it and there's another piece here

889
00:43:18.26 --> 00:43:23.82
It's called ownership right it's called ownership and if you're if you want to blame other people

890
00:43:23.82 --> 00:43:29.74
For the problem and I say this all the time if you don't take ownership of the problem the problem's not gonna get solved

891
00:43:29.74 --> 00:43:34.86
So if you blame your parents for not having raised you in a disciplined environment you're not gonna solve that problem

892
00:43:35.42 --> 00:43:37.98
You're looking at your parents saying if you would have done a better job

893
00:43:38.70 --> 00:43:42.14
Being more disciplined for me. I would be more disciplined now

894
00:43:43.34 --> 00:43:47.10
So that means that means you can't do anything the fact of the matter is it's wrong

895
00:43:47.10 --> 00:43:49.66
You actually can do something and it doesn't matter

896
00:43:49.66 --> 00:43:58.14
What do how your parents raised you and brought you up you can have the discipline you need to decide to do it

897
00:44:00.70 --> 00:44:02.70
So

898
00:44:02.70 --> 00:44:07.82
As long as you're blaming other people. I mean if you blame me for not discussing it you blame me for having zero

899
00:44:07.82 --> 00:44:12.86
Idea what that experience is like you blame your parents for not raising you this way as long as you're blaming other people

900
00:44:12.86 --> 00:44:16.78
As long as you're counting on other people to give you discipline as long as you do that you will not have it

901
00:44:16.78 --> 00:44:20.78
So again, I

902
00:44:21.50 --> 00:44:23.90
I'm sorry I should have made that I should make that more clearly

903
00:44:23.90 --> 00:44:26.38
And I'm trying to make it more clearly now and like my parents

904
00:44:27.66 --> 00:44:32.06
My parents are are good people they had successful careers as

905
00:44:33.58 --> 00:44:35.58
Educators in public schools

906
00:44:35.98 --> 00:44:40.14
And my mom eventually became went into school administration my dad taught

907
00:44:40.14 --> 00:44:47.50
In high school for 30 something years and they were good hardworking people and but I'll tell you they were no

908
00:44:48.78 --> 00:44:55.82
They were no extraordinary preachers of discipline and I'll tell you I had in fact I

909
00:44:57.58 --> 00:45:05.10
I never remember either one of them ever using the term or referring to discipline in any way

910
00:45:05.10 --> 00:45:12.94
You know when actually both my parents worked they both worked a lot my dad was coaching sports and we're doing after school stuff

911
00:45:12.94 --> 00:45:15.74
My mom same thing like we were on our own a bunch

912
00:45:16.14 --> 00:45:20.38
My parents were gone in the morning. We got ourselves to school when we got home in the afternoon. They weren't home

913
00:45:21.42 --> 00:45:28.06
You know, so it wasn't like they were setting up this rigid discipline manner for me, right and

914
00:45:30.14 --> 00:45:33.42
And you can see this with families many many different families

915
00:45:33.42 --> 00:45:35.42
There's families that have kids

916
00:45:36.46 --> 00:45:42.46
That the parents are very disciplined and the kids are wild and out of control sometimes that problem

917
00:45:42.46 --> 00:45:46.70
Attically so right kids that come from really good families, but they get addicted to drugs

918
00:45:47.10 --> 00:45:48.70
lack of discipline

919
00:45:48.70 --> 00:45:55.74
Kids that come from really good families, but they they spin out of control and and go in the wrong direction and there's also the opposite

920
00:45:56.30 --> 00:46:01.90
Which is hey the parents weren't around or the parents were abusive for the parents were drug addicts and and all the

921
00:46:01.90 --> 00:46:04.78
The kid comes out of that and is squared away is awesome

922
00:46:05.34 --> 00:46:09.50
And we saw that all the time the seal teams and I've said that before on this program doesn't matter

923
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:13.10
It doesn't matter where you're back around is this is what you decide to do

924
00:46:13.66 --> 00:46:15.66
yeah

925
00:46:17.66 --> 00:46:19.66
And I'll tell you another thing. It's not even

926
00:46:20.46 --> 00:46:24.54
From the military like the military requires discipline obviously

927
00:46:25.50 --> 00:46:27.90
But there's plenty of people in the military that don't have it

928
00:46:27.90 --> 00:46:34.94
Right and and many poor many people lose their discipline when they leave the militaries not being imposed on them anymore

929
00:46:35.50 --> 00:46:37.50
So I mean just go look around

930
00:46:37.50 --> 00:46:40.78
I mean being in the military does not make you a discipline person

931
00:46:41.66 --> 00:46:44.46
Being from a discipline family does not make you a discipline person

932
00:46:45.26 --> 00:46:49.42
Being in a discipline group does not make you a discipline person what makes you a discipline-

933
00:46:49.42 --> 00:46:51.42
person is choosing to be disciplined

934
00:46:53.74 --> 00:46:55.74
So

935
00:46:55.74 --> 00:47:00.62
Yeah, and and also as far as telling people the man up

936
00:47:01.98 --> 00:47:05.26
Which you know when someone says how do I

937
00:47:06.22 --> 00:47:10.78
Get up early every day. I say get up early every day. How do I stop eating sugar stop eating sugar

938
00:47:11.34 --> 00:47:12.94
That's the definition of man up

939
00:47:12.94 --> 00:47:17.26
But obviously it's not just men that need discipline in their life. I don't think I use that term

940
00:47:17.26 --> 00:47:20.06
But what I do tell people is to get after it

941
00:47:21.66 --> 00:47:23.66
That's what I tell people to get after it

942
00:47:23.66 --> 00:47:27.42
Yeah, I tell people to do the things that they know they're supposed to do

943
00:47:28.86 --> 00:47:31.74
Right there's things that you know you're supposed to do as a human being

944
00:47:32.46 --> 00:47:35.26
Things that you know are gonna improve your life do those things

945
00:47:35.58 --> 00:47:40.46
There's things that you know are gonna make you a worse person and make your life worse don't do those things

946
00:47:41.98 --> 00:47:47.90
Don't do the things that are making you weaker start doing the things that are gonna make you stronger and

947
00:47:47.90 --> 00:47:53.66
Smarter and faster and healthier and gonna make you a better human being and I'll say the same thing to this guy

948
00:47:55.42 --> 00:47:57.90
You want to be more disciplined get after it

949
00:47:58.86 --> 00:48:03.58
But it and get up early do some kind of workout eat good foods clean your room

950
00:48:03.82 --> 00:48:08.30
Make a list of things that you're supposed to do in your life and then wake up in the morning and do those things

951
00:48:08.86 --> 00:48:10.86
That you put on the list

952
00:48:11.74 --> 00:48:13.74
That's what discipline is

953
00:48:13.74 --> 00:48:15.74
And

954
00:48:15.74 --> 00:48:17.74
No, it is not easy

955
00:48:17.74 --> 00:48:20.06
But you're not gonna get it from anyone else, but you

956
00:48:21.58 --> 00:48:25.98
And it's worth it and it is the thing that is going to bring you freedom

957
00:48:27.98 --> 00:48:32.38
That's the key word right there when you said it's worth it

958
00:48:32.78 --> 00:48:38.22
You know what I think this is what I think I think like in an environment as like how he put it

959
00:48:38.22 --> 00:48:44.30
In undisciplined environment or something like that where he grew up in an undisciplined environment

960
00:48:45.58 --> 00:48:47.58
I don't obviously that's a very vague

961
00:48:49.50 --> 00:48:56.06
Expression right undisciplined environment. Yeah, that coming a lot of different things so a lot of times like when you're

962
00:48:56.46 --> 00:49:01.26
Brought up in a certain environment basically you're kind of taught or or not taught

963
00:49:02.22 --> 00:49:07.34
Like like the value of certain things so if you use like I don't know working out or whatever

964
00:49:07.34 --> 00:49:09.34
Right, so

965
00:49:09.74 --> 00:49:12.62
I'm gonna use myself as an example my dad doesn't athlete

966
00:49:13.90 --> 00:49:15.10
You know

967
00:49:15.10 --> 00:49:21.34
Not a superior athlete, but he was you know he knew like working out was a part of life and stuff like that and

968
00:49:21.90 --> 00:49:27.18
You know in elementary school where doing sports and stuff like that, you know some people

969
00:49:27.18 --> 00:49:31.90
They don't do that at all so when they grew up into adulthood that some people straight up

970
00:49:31.90 --> 00:49:38.86
Have never worked out before never been in the gym and you know so growing up they they were never taught the value of

971
00:49:39.98 --> 00:49:42.94
What work you know does for you? You never taught so they kind of appreciate it

972
00:49:42.94 --> 00:49:47.26
They just simply don't know the value sure they see people with you know, you know

973
00:49:47.66 --> 00:49:51.50
They're in shape where they can do these things and they're very function whatever they see that of course

974
00:49:51.50 --> 00:49:56.22
But they don't have that value. They don't feel that value. They just never learned it

975
00:49:56.70 --> 00:50:00.22
So it can come off as like this thing for other people, you know

976
00:50:00.22 --> 00:50:02.22
Like all that's what other people do kind of things

977
00:50:02.22 --> 00:50:08.86
So they don't understand the value so back to the point in their mind this weird the connection is not made that

978
00:50:08.86 --> 00:50:11.26
It's worth it because they don't know the value of it really

979
00:50:11.42 --> 00:50:15.82
But if you do know the value of it and then you can decide okay, is this worth it?

980
00:50:15.82 --> 00:50:22.70
Is it worth it to wake up every day and in quote unquote get after it for this particular goal or the this particular set of goals?

981
00:50:23.02 --> 00:50:27.66
So that's what it is and I think sure the undisciplined environment

982
00:50:27.66 --> 00:50:32.94
Can maybe provide that but I think you're right. I think that once you're like oh, yeah, that's worth it

983
00:50:32.94 --> 00:50:37.18
Yeah, you know how people they'll find reasons when it's worth it even though they've never experienced like

984
00:50:37.82 --> 00:50:41.42
You know like a person who has a heart attack or something is like and they have kids

985
00:50:41.98 --> 00:50:44.86
Young kids with some they have a heart attack maybe never worked out ever in their life

986
00:50:44.86 --> 00:50:48.22
They have heart attack they almost died. They're like guess what I'm working out every single day

987
00:50:48.22 --> 00:50:55.66
I'm a vegetarian now. Yeah, you know like doing major major changes that they've never even thought about making and they'll do it because they decided

988
00:50:55.66 --> 00:51:00.86
It's worth it and they'll be disciplined. They'll find that discipline real quick no matter how they're trained

989
00:51:01.26 --> 00:51:06.46
As you know they're environment because now you had it's gonna be worth it. That's it

990
00:51:06.70 --> 00:51:12.78
Yeah, and if it's not worth it, you said and that I think is what you develop the value of

991
00:51:13.50 --> 00:51:16.54
Working out the value of but you develop you can develop that from anywhere

992
00:51:16.94 --> 00:51:24.14
That's one of that's but essentially that's certainly developed that from any any you can develop that from from anywhere

993
00:51:24.14 --> 00:51:27.74
Yeah, yeah, you can get it from parents you can get it from yeah exactly right exactly right

994
00:51:27.98 --> 00:51:31.26
But the discipline itself just like I said that's gonna come from you

995
00:51:31.82 --> 00:51:38.30
Your parents can teach it but guess who it has to it's still you it's still you and you can go to the military

996
00:51:38.54 --> 00:51:41.26
To specifically learn discipline when you leave

997
00:51:41.66 --> 00:51:44.86
It's on you who's it yeah exactly right and just like I said like yeah

998
00:51:44.86 --> 00:51:50.38
I know people who were done with the military and are glad they're done with that right they're glad with this waking up early

999
00:51:50.38 --> 00:51:55.58
They're bad they get they've done for six months they're out of shape. They're not doing it productive

1000
00:51:55.58 --> 00:52:00.94
It's it's horrible to say yeah, but it happens happens with the military it happens with anything

1001
00:52:01.26 --> 00:52:03.26
Yeah, because when kids get out of high school sports

1002
00:52:04.22 --> 00:52:06.46
You know, and all of a sudden they don't want enough to do that anymore

1003
00:52:06.46 --> 00:52:08.46
I don't have to listen to coach yeah

1004
00:52:10.70 --> 00:52:13.98
Crazy don't listen to coach listen to yourself yourself. Yeah

1005
00:52:13.98 --> 00:52:20.14
Did determine whether or not it's worth it and I'm telling you that you don't need to determine I'm telling you

1006
00:52:20.14 --> 00:52:24.54
It's worth it. Oh, yeah, I'm telling you it is worth it. And you know what you actually know it's worth it

1007
00:52:24.54 --> 00:52:27.26
That's why you're asking this question you know it's worth it

1008
00:52:27.26 --> 00:52:29.90
You know it's worth it to have discipline, but you think there's an easier way

1009
00:52:30.14 --> 00:52:34.46
You think that it's something that people have you think that when jocos alarm clock goes off

1010
00:52:34.86 --> 00:52:40.30
It's like oh just like my father taught me I rise and I shine you know like no

1011
00:52:40.30 --> 00:52:46.06
It's like the pillow feels soft and comfortable and the alarm clock is banging on my head

1012
00:52:46.06 --> 00:52:49.98
And I don't like it, but you know what I know it's worth it to get up and get after it

1013
00:52:49.98 --> 00:52:54.06
I know it's worth it and you know it's worth it. Here's the thing though. We all know it's worth it

1014
00:52:54.06 --> 00:52:56.86
Is it in a way you're right, but like really though really

1015
00:52:57.66 --> 00:53:02.62
I'm gonna be open and honest with you. I don't think that people know it's worth it

1016
00:53:02.62 --> 00:53:07.34
I think they know it's worth it like the kind on paper. You know they have a multiple choice question is it worth it?

1017
00:53:07.34 --> 00:53:11.74
Yes or no, they'll be like yes. Obviously. I know working out is worth it

1018
00:53:11.74 --> 00:53:17.50
But here's the thing. I don't if you don't know if you don't like like having good credit for example

1019
00:53:17.98 --> 00:53:19.98
So I never got taught like why

1020
00:53:21.10 --> 00:53:26.70
Really my mom said yeah, you should have good credit. That's it. That's the limit to my education on credit

1021
00:53:26.70 --> 00:53:31.18
Right, so of course they're below it because they get you know I fall for literally all the tricks

1022
00:53:32.06 --> 00:53:34.06
It's self-inflicted and otherwise

1023
00:53:34.06 --> 00:53:41.50
Credit gets jammed up so I don't know. I don't know the value. I don't know. I have never experienced the benefits of having good

1024
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:48.46
I don't know the value of the credit. So it really didn't mean much to me really my credit was like junk and I didn't care until I got

1025
00:53:49.02 --> 00:53:55.74
Denied for something then I cared you know, but just like if you're never into working out until you're in a specific situation where it shows

1026
00:53:55.74 --> 00:54:02.38
But but like this guy that's asking this question and glad he's asking the question. I'm not I'm trying I'm not trying to come off all hard

1027
00:54:02.38 --> 00:54:04.38
Um

1028
00:54:04.70 --> 00:54:06.70
But he realizes

1029
00:54:06.70 --> 00:54:10.70
He realizes the value of discipline because he's saying that he wants it right?

1030
00:54:10.70 --> 00:54:18.06
He knows that it's gonna make his life better. Yeah, and and and that's why I think he's he's gotten jammed up

1031
00:54:18.06 --> 00:54:23.02
In whatever way we don't know because I don't know him maybe he's gotten unhealthy maybe he's you know

1032
00:54:23.02 --> 00:54:25.58
Who knows? Maybe he's gotten his finances jammed up?

1033
00:54:25.74 --> 00:54:29.18
What ever the case may be he knows that discipline is better for them him?

1034
00:54:29.18 --> 00:54:31.18
He knows that he does know

1035
00:54:31.82 --> 00:54:36.46
This isn't a guy that doesn't know yet because sure there's people that don't you know when you're 16 years old

1036
00:54:36.46 --> 00:54:39.90
You don't know the value of discipline. You don't know that the what you're at the way you're acting right now

1037
00:54:39.90 --> 00:54:44.62
It's gonna affect you in five years. You don't know that you can set yourself you're to hold life up to be pretty awesome

1038
00:54:44.94 --> 00:54:49.34
Yeah, you don't know that yet. You're just like worried about where you're going on a Friday night

1039
00:54:49.66 --> 00:54:51.66
right? Yeah, so this guy knows

1040
00:54:53.26 --> 00:54:55.26
And he wants it and

1041
00:54:55.26 --> 00:55:03.58
He's looking for where he can find it and where he can find it is in the mirror. Yeah, that's where it is

1042
00:55:04.46 --> 00:55:07.90
So do it brother good luck get on the path and stay on the path

1043
00:55:08.38 --> 00:55:11.74
Yeah, and that's gonna be beneficial when you do the I've a stem

1044
00:55:12.46 --> 00:55:18.06
harshly maintaining that like not knowing the value is a big is a big thing it's kind of like okay

1045
00:55:18.06 --> 00:55:20.06
So back to my credit thing

1046
00:55:20.62 --> 00:55:22.62
There is a point at the end where okay, so

1047
00:55:22.62 --> 00:55:26.14
You know like I don't know 10 years ago or whatever I I

1048
00:55:26.62 --> 00:55:32.70
Repaired my credit I my credit was repaired I went to it was painstaking not fun stuff

1049
00:55:33.26 --> 00:55:39.42
But I did it got my credit repaired and now I know the value because as an adult I'm functioning

1050
00:55:39.74 --> 00:55:44.86
It's useful now, you know, so now I know the value of having good credit because I've been through all the things that

1051
00:55:45.42 --> 00:55:47.02
Having good credit

1052
00:55:47.02 --> 00:55:53.42
Bring you through you know now I'm thinking I'll never go back to bed, okay, never it's what that every single day

1053
00:55:53.42 --> 00:55:57.18
I'm telling you that I agree with what you're saying yeah, I agree with what you're saying

1054
00:55:57.66 --> 00:56:01.02
I'm saying that this guy knows the value and that's why he wants it

1055
00:56:01.26 --> 00:56:06.38
Yeah, it's like when you freak realize that you got denied for something and you were like oh

1056
00:56:06.38 --> 00:56:11.66
That oh credit has value I understand that yeah something happened in his life where he said discipline has value

1057
00:56:11.66 --> 00:56:14.06
I know that now, but you did credit repair

1058
00:56:14.06 --> 00:56:22.38
And and what you said was okay, I need to go out and repair my credit you didn't say hey, you know what my mom didn't tell me about bad credit now

1059
00:56:22.38 --> 00:56:27.58
I have bad credit. Yeah, so now what am I supposed to do you know who repaired your credit? Who repaired your credit?

1060
00:56:28.38 --> 00:56:32.86
It was a combination of my wife and I but yeah, but who repaired your credit? Yeah, we did it. Yeah, we did this

1061
00:56:33.42 --> 00:56:36.70
You took responsibility for it and said okay, I'm gonna get my credit for you. You talked to you

1062
00:56:36.70 --> 00:56:45.42
Life because she's smarter than you. She was like hey, I will I will help this but it was you that said okay, I got to get this fixed and you got help

1063
00:56:46.22 --> 00:56:48.22
But you knew to reach out for help

1064
00:56:48.30 --> 00:56:53.18
But you're the one that ultimately is responsible for yeah, you're right about that like I didn't like

1065
00:56:53.82 --> 00:56:56.54
And it blame my parents and then continue

1066
00:56:56.54 --> 00:57:03.02
I mean that good right right like you said no I got to get value this this thing has credit has value

1067
00:57:03.02 --> 00:57:08.54
I need to fix it yeah, and you fixed it yeah, regardless the way I came from regardless

1068
00:57:10.86 --> 00:57:17.10
So what oh, you know, oh, you don't know how to work out cool then you go higher personal trainer because you know it's gonna it's the right thing to do

1069
00:57:17.10 --> 00:57:23.34
You know what I mean? Oh, you don't know how to repair your finances cool go get a counselor that's gonna help you repair your finances

1070
00:57:23.34 --> 00:57:28.54
Oh, you're addicted to drugs or alcohol. Okay. I'm gonna go find a counselor or join a group so I can get through that thing

1071
00:57:28.54 --> 00:57:34.14
Yeah, no one's gonna hold your hand and bring you into any of those situations you gotta do yourself you gotta have the discipline to make it happen

1072
00:57:43.18 --> 00:57:46.54
Number seven good morning

1073
00:57:49.26 --> 00:57:54.54
Did you find that people in the military mock those that emphasize the importance of good leadership

1074
00:57:54.54 --> 00:58:00.54
Who take leading and our responsibility seriously? What does that mean mocking like

1075
00:58:01.26 --> 00:58:05.74
Big fun of you. Yeah, like what people in the military making making fun of you

1076
00:58:06.38 --> 00:58:09.98
Because you take leadership super seriously. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1077
00:58:09.98 --> 00:58:14.38
Yeah, this is a nice go. This is an interesting question. So it makes me a little bit nervous

1078
00:58:15.26 --> 00:58:21.34
Because my suspicion is that this individual might be going about being a good leader the wrong way

1079
00:58:21.34 --> 00:58:28.70
And if you go about it the wrong way people can take offense to it if you're the guy that goes around telling everyone that you're a leader

1080
00:58:28.70 --> 00:58:31.18
And you're trying to be great leader people will take offense to that

1081
00:58:31.74 --> 00:58:35.18
But you can't make that part of your thing right

1082
00:58:36.86 --> 00:58:43.42
People that talk about the importance of good leadership right they come across as implying that they are a good leader

1083
00:58:44.94 --> 00:58:46.94
and and

1084
00:58:46.94 --> 00:58:53.66
That can be offensive especially if you aren't quite as good of a leader as you think you are

1085
00:58:54.54 --> 00:58:57.66
She ran around like you understand how important leadership is

1086
00:58:58.22 --> 00:59:01.90
Like just think about that statement right there you understand the importance of leadership echo

1087
00:59:02.22 --> 00:59:07.02
I'll all of a sudden I'm basically telling you like I'm a good leader and you're not right when the reality is just the way I'm talking

1088
00:59:07.02 --> 00:59:08.30
proves that I'm not a good leader

1089
00:59:08.30 --> 00:59:10.30
Because I'm talking down to you

1090
00:59:10.70 --> 00:59:14.70
So we have a problem right there and also

1091
00:59:14.70 --> 00:59:16.70
If you

1092
00:59:18.70 --> 00:59:22.30
Take leading and our leading responsibility seriously. What does that actually mean?

1093
00:59:24.30 --> 00:59:26.70
Does that mean that you can't have any fun with your team?

1094
00:59:27.98 --> 00:59:30.94
Does that mean you can't laugh at yourself when you've made a mistake?

1095
00:59:32.86 --> 00:59:42.62
Does that mean that you are trying so hard to give off the impression that you are a great leader that it appears to everyone else that you aren't

1096
00:59:42.62 --> 00:59:47.82
Really who you act like and that your character is is disingenuous

1097
00:59:49.82 --> 00:59:56.62
Right if I'm if I'm constantly trying to put up this front that I'm the great leader everyone starts looking at me thinking that guy's not even

1098
00:59:56.86 --> 01:00:00.62
That's not that's not the real him. He's just trying to rock around like a like a

1099
01:00:02.22 --> 01:00:05.90
He's not true right you think about that you're trying to build trust it and as a leader

1100
01:00:06.78 --> 01:00:12.38
We we're trying to build trust we talked you can dick winters talking about honesty being the most one of the most important traits

1101
01:00:12.38 --> 01:00:18.62
of a leader but if we're putting up a facade and how we act that does not come across as honest

1102
01:00:19.42 --> 01:00:21.90
And that doesn't build trust in fact it builds the opposite and

1103
01:00:26.06 --> 01:00:30.94
Also if if if you have to put up a leadership front

1104
01:00:33.34 --> 01:00:38.46
If you have to put up a leadership front if in other words if sometimes you have to act a certain way

1105
01:00:38.46 --> 01:00:46.62
Fake it going back to something earlier if you have to act and fake like a leader that means you might be

1106
01:00:47.42 --> 01:00:53.18
You might be insecure about your leadership capability and you will come across as insecure and people

1107
01:00:53.18 --> 01:00:55.58
Consents that insecurity so that can be very problematic

1108
01:00:56.30 --> 01:00:59.82
Also if you're so into being a good leader

1109
01:01:01.98 --> 01:01:03.98
That probably means that you have issues

1110
01:01:04.70 --> 01:01:06.70
Giving up the reins

1111
01:01:06.70 --> 01:01:11.26
That means that you are probably micro managing

1112
01:01:12.30 --> 01:01:17.66
Because you want to be a leader you want to prove everyone that you're a good leader and so you start micro managing and

1113
01:01:18.22 --> 01:01:20.94
No one wants to follow a micro manager. They don't want to do that

1114
01:01:23.18 --> 01:01:25.18
And if you add

1115
01:01:25.90 --> 01:01:27.90
All these things together

1116
01:01:28.62 --> 01:01:30.62
What what do people end up doing

1117
01:01:32.78 --> 01:01:34.78
They end up mocking you

1118
01:01:34.78 --> 01:01:40.94
They end up mocking the things that you think are important like leadership itself

1119
01:01:41.66 --> 01:01:43.66
They start to make fun of it

1120
01:01:45.10 --> 01:01:47.10
It's

1121
01:01:47.10 --> 01:01:49.50
The it's like the needle I think its name is

1122
01:01:50.46 --> 01:01:52.46
Needle myor in animal house

1123
01:01:53.26 --> 01:01:54.46
Is this the right name?

1124
01:01:54.46 --> 01:01:57.10
I don't know I've got a kind of a movie reference

1125
01:01:57.10 --> 01:01:59.02
Yeah, I don't know if you do this is messed up

1126
01:01:59.02 --> 01:02:01.26
I like you can give you the John blue sheet. That's all

1127
01:02:01.26 --> 01:02:07.02
So there's it's like the leader the the ROTC guy. Yeah, he's a guy that's like Mr. Leader

1128
01:02:08.70 --> 01:02:13.98
And everyone makes fun of him. Yeah, he's trying to be a great leader. He's trying to be the

1129
01:02:13.98 --> 01:02:16.38
Aforetative figure everyone is making fun of him

1130
01:02:17.58 --> 01:02:19.34
So you have to be careful in this case

1131
01:02:20.94 --> 01:02:22.54
I would recommend

1132
01:02:22.54 --> 01:02:28.30
You move to the center a little bit more meaning that on the one hand you have a leader that isn't building relationship isn't building trust

1133
01:02:28.30 --> 01:02:33.26
Expects people to do is they are told and and treat treat that leader with respect to even though they haven't earned it

1134
01:02:34.94 --> 01:02:38.86
That's not a good leader on the other hand. You have leaders that are too close with the troops has

1135
01:02:39.50 --> 01:02:41.82
Very personal relationships two personal

1136
01:02:41.98 --> 01:02:46.06
Relationships with the team and has lost any semblance of authority over the team

1137
01:02:46.06 --> 01:02:48.94
So there's your two extremes you want to be balanced in the middle

1138
01:02:48.94 --> 01:02:52.38
You want to build relationships with your people you want to build your team up

1139
01:02:52.38 --> 01:02:59.02
And also forcing leadership on the people does not work any more

1140
01:03:00.06 --> 01:03:07.02
than forcing a religion or a diet or a workout or a political breed belief system

1141
01:03:09.18 --> 01:03:14.54
And can you make someone from a from a leadership perspective if you have a 40 over other people

1142
01:03:14.54 --> 01:03:18.54
Can you make someone bow down to your program mechanically for a little while?

1143
01:03:18.54 --> 01:03:23.90
Now yeah, you can you can but

1144
01:03:25.58 --> 01:03:29.50
If it's not from them if they're not part of it

1145
01:03:30.54 --> 01:03:33.58
Willfully it's not going to work over time

1146
01:03:35.02 --> 01:03:40.38
So you know don't be people up verbally with your leadership lessons

1147
01:03:40.38 --> 01:03:49.42
Hmm don't make it your external religion that you are forcing on people internally

1148
01:03:49.42 --> 01:03:53.26
Yes, of course, obviously my I always thought about leadership

1149
01:03:54.62 --> 01:03:56.62
I always thought about leadership

1150
01:03:56.94 --> 01:04:01.74
But I wasn't barking it and I don't I don't even think I don't even think

1151
01:04:05.58 --> 01:04:08.62
Like my the best the people that taught me the most about leadership

1152
01:04:08.62 --> 01:04:10.62
They never said the word to me about leadership

1153
01:04:11.50 --> 01:04:16.70
Right and I'm not saying that that's the best course of action because because sometimes it is good

1154
01:04:17.26 --> 01:04:19.34
You know pull someone aside and say hey

1155
01:04:19.58 --> 01:04:22.62
This the way you're acting right now in front of your troops and that that's not gonna be effective

1156
01:04:22.94 --> 01:04:24.70
Sometimes that is good

1157
01:04:24.70 --> 01:04:27.98
Especially once you've built the relationship because if I don't have a relationship with you

1158
01:04:27.98 --> 01:04:31.66
I can when I say hey, I need to talk you hey the way you're treating your guys right now

1159
01:04:31.66 --> 01:04:35.42
Isn't gonna go over very well with them. What's your reaction gonna be you're gonna be pissed?

1160
01:04:35.42 --> 01:04:39.42
Yeah, you think I don't know my guys. I know them better than you and we're gonna have a problem

1161
01:04:39.42 --> 01:04:42.54
I did I accomplished nothing my coaching and mentoring of you

1162
01:04:43.42 --> 01:04:45.42
Was horrible because we didn't have a relationship

1163
01:04:46.38 --> 01:04:48.38
So you're not listening

1164
01:04:48.38 --> 01:04:53.66
And obviously of course when I start coaching and mentoring that implies that I'm the greatest leader of all time

1165
01:04:54.14 --> 01:04:55.58
That's my that's the thnm

1166
01:04:55.58 --> 01:05:01.50
Plied statement you saw come great which people reject that as well especially when you're not that great of a leader in the first place

1167
01:05:01.50 --> 01:05:03.50
Hmm

1168
01:05:03.50 --> 01:05:08.86
So don't talk about it so much just leave be a good leader open up the discussions

1169
01:05:11.58 --> 01:05:18.06
Take a wrap off come from the flank instead of going straight on maneuver

1170
01:05:18.70 --> 01:05:23.98
tactically and tactfully get into their heads and make better leaders

1171
01:05:24.94 --> 01:05:26.94
By actually

1172
01:05:26.94 --> 01:05:28.94
Yeah

1173
01:05:29.90 --> 01:05:38.54
Yes, kind of like that lead you know lead by example kind of thing it kind of makes you like the question kind of how you said at the beginning it makes you wonder

1174
01:05:39.74 --> 01:05:45.10
He says the question is do you find the people in the military mock those that emphasize the importance of good leadership

1175
01:05:45.26 --> 01:05:49.02
You kind of think yourself. I wonder how this person is

1176
01:05:49.50 --> 01:05:53.98
emphasize in the importance of good is he the guy at the party who you know

1177
01:05:53.98 --> 01:05:59.82
People are talking about I don't know the food or something then he just bust out leadership stuff

1178
01:05:59.82 --> 01:06:03.58
You know that guy you know who's like everything on a like the RLTC guy

1179
01:06:03.58 --> 01:06:08.78
Yeah, like everything he's just pushing it everything, you know leadership everything

1180
01:06:08.78 --> 01:06:12.38
Leadership is everything, we weren't even talking about that leadership is everything kind of thing either way

1181
01:06:12.38 --> 01:06:17.34
Work this is coming from a person me that I literally talk about leadership all the time

1182
01:06:17.34 --> 01:06:26.06
I think yeah, and I actually think that way and I get up on stage and in companies and in front of military members and police officers

1183
01:06:26.06 --> 01:06:28.86
And I talk about leadership that's what I talk about all the time. Yeah

1184
01:06:30.22 --> 01:06:32.94
And that's what you know what's interesting that's what makes about face

1185
01:06:34.22 --> 01:06:39.18
By Colonel David Hackworth the one of the best things about that book is it's not a leadership book

1186
01:06:39.18 --> 01:06:44.38
He doesn't he just talk he barely talks about he barely says a straightforward sentences

1187
01:06:44.38 --> 01:06:51.26
That this is how you lead it's all from the flank and that's why it gets you so

1188
01:06:51.82 --> 01:06:54.22
Well because it's from the flank

1189
01:06:54.94 --> 01:06:57.74
Yeah, it's not a book about leadership doesn't even say like you know

1190
01:06:58.14 --> 01:07:00.14
How many books get published all the time?

1191
01:07:01.18 --> 01:07:04.22
You know this is a leadership book I wrote a book with life

1192
01:07:05.42 --> 01:07:11.18
How to lead and win yeah hackworth did it better hackworth's like oh this is about

1193
01:07:11.18 --> 01:07:18.70
Or read it yeah in a way hey, I digley you've seen but obviously that's your job

1194
01:07:18.70 --> 01:07:23.50
Well, I guess my point is that if you're if this is coming from someone who talks about leadership all the time

1195
01:07:23.74 --> 01:07:28.30
Literally wrote a book about leadership. Yeah, and I'm saying hey you might not want to talk about it

1196
01:07:28.30 --> 01:07:33.10
That's my point. Yeah, yeah, that's my point. Yeah good point just just just

1197
01:07:33.10 --> 01:07:42.78
Back off a little bit. Yeah, so if you were like you know you go on the road you do one of your you know your deals and then you know at dinner

1198
01:07:44.22 --> 01:07:46.22
With your family you start

1199
01:07:47.34 --> 01:07:49.74
Going into your leadership stuff with them

1200
01:07:50.46 --> 01:07:55.74
That's what you should it do. Yes, yes, but I'm what I'm saying is with your team with your platoon

1201
01:07:55.74 --> 01:08:02.46
You don't sit there and say all right today. We're gonna talk about leadership again

1202
01:08:02.86 --> 01:08:06.70
Yeah, you don't quote unquote emphasize the importance of good leadership right you

1203
01:08:07.26 --> 01:08:12.38
Just lead yeah, yeah, they're smarter than you think there you know what you're into doing

1204
01:08:12.38 --> 01:08:16.86
I'll as you're kind of condescending you can't help it you're treating them like they don't know

1205
01:08:16.86 --> 01:08:19.90
You want to talk about the importance of leadership. They know what the importance of leadership during the military

1206
01:08:19.90 --> 01:08:28.86
Yeah, in fact in example of their reaction of how people take it when you start preaching to them

1207
01:08:28.94 --> 01:08:30.94
You know how they take it they mock you

1208
01:08:31.74 --> 01:08:35.58
That's a lesson learned you know that's a lesson learned if people are mocking you

1209
01:08:35.74 --> 01:08:37.74
They're not taking you seriously

1210
01:08:37.74 --> 01:08:39.98
Yeah, that means you're doing something wrong

1211
01:08:39.98 --> 01:08:45.34
What you're doing wrong in this case is you're condescendingly talking to them about the importance of leadership

1212
01:08:45.34 --> 01:08:47.66
They know what the importance of leadership is yeah

1213
01:08:47.66 --> 01:08:52.30
They're in the military they know how bad it is to have a bad platoon sergeant or bad platoon

1214
01:08:53.10 --> 01:08:55.10
Platoon commander they know

1215
01:08:55.98 --> 01:08:57.98
Don't need to rub it in their face yeah

1216
01:08:58.78 --> 01:09:02.70
I remember I think I told you the story about one of my friends not a names name because I'm

1217
01:09:03.26 --> 01:09:08.70
Surtin you know you see me, we're at a party and he got he got you and he's

1218
01:09:09.50 --> 01:09:14.86
Sitting at the table explaining to all of us how badass navy seals are yeah like for a long time

1219
01:09:14.86 --> 01:09:19.34
Two, this is and he even said those words navy seals are just so badass like we're so badass

1220
01:09:19.34 --> 01:09:24.14
And this is why and all this stuff and it's the exact same thing because we know navy seals are badass

1221
01:09:24.14 --> 01:09:30.78
But you sitting here telling us how badass you and yeah all navy seals are is gonna make us mock you

1222
01:09:30.78 --> 01:09:31.98
Yeah, they're gonna get mocks

1223
01:09:31.98 --> 01:09:33.02
Yeah, even a little bit

1224
01:09:33.02 --> 01:09:33.82
You get mocked a lot

1225
01:09:33.82 --> 01:09:37.42
You be mocked by other navy seals by the way for sure doing that stuff

1226
01:09:38.06 --> 01:09:39.26
Anyway check well

1227
01:09:39.50 --> 01:09:42.06
I'm glad that this guy is asking the question

1228
01:09:42.06 --> 01:09:50.30
I'm glad that the guy is focused on leadership and I hope that these points can come across and be digested

1229
01:09:51.42 --> 01:09:53.42
with no

1230
01:09:53.58 --> 01:09:57.58
You know, they're just really easy to get offended by what I'm saying right if you're amulate

1231
01:09:57.58 --> 01:10:00.86
We just doesn't get it, you know, I mean it's really easy to say that yeah, he's as it

1232
01:10:02.62 --> 01:10:04.70
Oh, it's easy for him to say he just know what he's talking about

1233
01:10:04.70 --> 01:10:06.70
I'm the one that's here. I'm trying to get these guys to be better

1234
01:10:06.70 --> 01:10:10.22
You know, I'm trying to get my but to understand the importance of leadership. I know man

1235
01:10:10.22 --> 01:10:16.70
I know when I respect that I like the fact that you're have that mindset man. That's awesome. That's awesome

1236
01:10:18.22 --> 01:10:22.70
Come from the flank a little bit come from the flank man. You're not gonna you're not gonna

1237
01:10:23.50 --> 01:10:25.90
You're not gonna get that get it done this way. Yeah

1238
01:10:27.98 --> 01:10:32.70
It's kind of like if you try to convince everyone that you're the most humble person in the world

1239
01:10:33.10 --> 01:10:33.90
You know

1240
01:10:33.90 --> 01:10:37.58
I'm like nobody more humble than me. Yeah, I'm the most humble. I'm humbleer than that guy

1241
01:10:37.58 --> 01:10:42.30
I'm humbleer than you I'm humbleer than anyone who ever lived just the most humble guy in the world

1242
01:10:42.94 --> 01:10:44.94
Just doesn't work like that. That's a work there

1243
01:10:46.62 --> 01:10:48.62
Next question

1244
01:10:49.34 --> 01:10:52.14
Joko how do you lead a team of volunteers

1245
01:10:53.90 --> 01:10:57.90
How to punish or discipline them can't threaten to fire them

1246
01:10:59.58 --> 01:11:02.94
Because they're all I have I know a leader does so much

1247
01:11:02.94 --> 01:11:10.30
More than threatened and punished, but I need some guidance try to motivate but feel the need to do more

1248
01:11:10.30 --> 01:11:15.74
Thank try to answer this one quickly once again because this is kind of a question I've answered before in a different form

1249
01:11:17.34 --> 01:11:22.46
Do they understand why they're doing what they're doing and do they understand why it's important? Do they understand how?

1250
01:11:22.62 --> 01:11:24.62
What they are doing will benefit them?

1251
01:11:25.34 --> 01:11:27.98
Do they also see you

1252
01:11:29.50 --> 01:11:31.50
Working hard to try and make things happen

1253
01:11:31.50 --> 01:11:37.50
So those are those are just the basic questions. Let's just get those out there every time every time someone's not doing what you want them to do

1254
01:11:37.66 --> 01:11:43.02
Do they understand why they're doing what they're doing? Do they understand why it's important to the mission and do they understand?

1255
01:11:43.02 --> 01:11:45.34
How being successful in the mission will benefit them?

1256
01:11:45.66 --> 01:11:48.38
So so let's just get those out of the way next

1257
01:11:48.94 --> 01:11:52.62
What can we do here have you gamified the situation at all? How do you like that?

1258
01:11:53.42 --> 01:11:57.42
Gamified right have you gamified the situation because I realized that's a term that's getting thrown around now

1259
01:11:57.42 --> 01:12:01.82
But we would gamify stupid things all the time in the seal teams to make them fun

1260
01:12:02.30 --> 01:12:04.14
Right how much brass can you pick up?

1261
01:12:04.14 --> 01:12:08.14
Let's see I'll pick up more than you my squad will pick up more brass and you'll pick up all this

1262
01:12:08.14 --> 01:12:14.06
And we're running around the range trying to pick up brass one of the most miserable things that you have to do in the seal teams is pick up brass off the hot range in the summer time

1263
01:12:14.78 --> 01:12:16.78
And you do it for for like two days

1264
01:12:17.18 --> 01:12:19.34
Because once you get done with all your work you got to go pick up

1265
01:12:20.22 --> 01:12:26.86
Millions of rounds of brass spread out all over the desert in in August in the imperial valley

1266
01:12:26.86 --> 01:12:30.06
It's hot it sucks, but guess what we're gonna do have a contest

1267
01:12:30.78 --> 01:12:32.78
So what are you gonna do to gamify?

1268
01:12:33.66 --> 01:12:35.66
Like what kind of cool competition

1269
01:12:36.94 --> 01:12:40.46
Around some short term goal. Can you set up that's gonna be?

1270
01:12:41.26 --> 01:12:43.50
That's gonna make it fun for them some kind of cool reward

1271
01:12:44.62 --> 01:12:46.30
What about some kind of friendly bets

1272
01:12:47.18 --> 01:12:50.14
Around achieving something like I bet if I raise this much money

1273
01:12:50.14 --> 01:12:56.14
You know I will go to work with a pair of underwear on my head or you have to you know what I mean whatever these stupid bets

1274
01:12:57.26 --> 01:13:00.06
You know what we used to do in the teams is we bet one dollar

1275
01:13:01.02 --> 01:13:03.02
One of my old running mates

1276
01:13:03.02 --> 01:13:05.02
We we we we had something like critical

1277
01:13:05.90 --> 01:13:07.90
About you one dollar yeah

1278
01:13:08.54 --> 01:13:12.46
That was like the biggest bet you could make yeah because it's just it's pure pride

1279
01:13:13.02 --> 01:13:17.82
So you know and then we we'd always have fun if you were collecting or if you're giving the dollar

1280
01:13:17.82 --> 01:13:22.78
Collecting the dollar was just totally glorious yeah giving the dollar was shame

1281
01:13:23.26 --> 01:13:28.26
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, like you could add like okay when you give me this dollar eight has me in front of everybody

1282
01:13:28.42 --> 01:13:33.34
V you have to I don't know you have to do it while like walking in your knees just something to real

1283
01:13:33.34 --> 01:13:36.60
Yeah, but we didn't even have to do all that yeah

1284
01:13:36.60 --> 01:13:40.78
For you just understand me in my run-and-mate if we won or lost the bet it was like

1285
01:13:41.38 --> 01:13:45.50
What a loser, you know and you wouldn't even ask for the money you just look at them

1286
01:13:45.50 --> 01:13:52.18
And this bugged mind he had one of the most classic looks when he'd give you the look when I've lose a bet to him

1287
01:13:52.18 --> 01:13:54.42
He gave me the look. I I wanted to cry

1288
01:13:55.66 --> 01:13:58.06
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, last one more than that. Yeah, last one more

1289
01:13:58.06 --> 01:14:03.34
So maybe you make a bet for a dollar and if that's not working okay now that's not working if you can't game a fight if you can't have fun with it

1290
01:14:05.22 --> 01:14:06.74
Maybe ask them

1291
01:14:06.74 --> 01:14:08.98
while they're why they are there and

1292
01:14:09.34 --> 01:14:11.34
and figure out

1293
01:14:11.34 --> 01:14:15.86
What their motivation is for being there and how you can tie that into something concrete and

1294
01:14:16.42 --> 01:14:20.96
Then also look like you might have some people that aren't really into this and

1295
01:14:21.74 --> 01:14:26.18
Then lower your expectations of this particular group of people and gone recruit some people that want to get after it

1296
01:14:29.34 --> 01:14:31.34
Makes sense yeah

1297
01:14:33.18 --> 01:14:40.82
Have some fun fun goes a long way yeah fun goes a long way having fun doing things goes a long way and

1298
01:14:40.82 --> 01:14:44.54
And that praise thing to you know when you said like add like a reward or something for

1299
01:14:45.02 --> 01:14:49.90
Because a lot of times especially volunteers were so you know and we all feel this like even at work

1300
01:14:49.90 --> 01:14:53.90
You can have like a super fun job, but you'll get you to people generally

1301
01:14:53.90 --> 01:14:57.10
Be speaking tend to get complacent in one way or another

1302
01:14:57.10 --> 01:15:01.10
You know when things are routine or things are you know not as exciting or whatever

1303
01:15:01.82 --> 01:15:07.02
And you know when you're volunteering and that happens it's kind of like you're not tied there by a paycheck really

1304
01:15:07.02 --> 01:15:11.46
You know, which is just it's just a powerful tie, you know that people have to work. It's like yeah, I don't like my job

1305
01:15:11.46 --> 01:15:14.14
But it's pays bills and paying the bills is a big deal kind of thing

1306
01:15:15.26 --> 01:15:20.66
So if you add that element of excitement or fun or you know a little personal payoff in one way or another

1307
01:15:20.66 --> 01:15:26.52
I think that helps a lot of the time indeed and that tends to happen to if the if the Lee

1308
01:15:26.52 --> 01:15:28.62
I'm not saying this person is doing this or not doing this, but

1309
01:15:29.18 --> 01:15:36.50
like if they become kind of complacent and not recognizing how much they they they appreciate the volunteers

1310
01:15:36.50 --> 01:15:40.14
You know like if they're just like oh, yeah, this just business is usual, you know

1311
01:15:40.14 --> 01:15:43.14
Thanks for coming in that's kind of it kind of thing and they're you know

1312
01:15:43.14 --> 01:15:48.30
Then it just gets kind of kind of blog, you know like it doesn't not the payoff that they used to have you know

1313
01:15:48.30 --> 01:15:51.66
But if you kind of keep that going, it's keep them in the game

1314
01:15:53.38 --> 01:15:55.38
Next question

1315
01:15:55.38 --> 01:15:59.42
Do I need to keep training due to if I hate it?

1316
01:15:59.42 --> 01:16:06.34
I mean can I just live my life the way I think it should be which is of health energy and become becoming a force of nature

1317
01:16:06.34 --> 01:16:13.22
as a doctor without dreaming up of some invisible enemies on the street that I've yet to come across and preparing and spending my

1318
01:16:13.38 --> 01:16:20.06
Pitons of wage of a wage on lessons that I hate in every sorts of ways for something that might be avoided

1319
01:16:20.38 --> 01:16:26.78
physical clash if I learned to use wit and saving my money to move into a good neighborhood and I've been successful in

1320
01:16:26.78 --> 01:16:35.50
Preventing physical clash is to occur. I've learned basic ways to escape the mount I can run. I'm fairly strong isn't that enough?

1321
01:16:37.98 --> 01:16:40.46
Okay, so yeah, bro

1322
01:16:43.10 --> 01:16:44.70
Do you just who is not the meaning of life?

1323
01:16:44.70 --> 01:16:52.14
All right, you just who has a lot of I mean I find you jitsu very enjoyable. I get a lot out of it beyond

1324
01:16:52.14 --> 01:17:02.14
Physical training beyond self defense. Yeah, I get a lot out of it and I apply it in all different sorts of realms in my life

1325
01:17:03.02 --> 01:17:05.02
But if you hate it and

1326
01:17:06.30 --> 01:17:12.38
And you've learned some basic ways to defend yourself to escape the mount maybe some basic guards type stuff

1327
01:17:13.34 --> 01:17:18.46
Then then okay, I mean then step away. I mean you shouldn't be going through life doing something that you hate

1328
01:17:18.46 --> 01:17:24.06
If I were you I'd still train occasionally even if it's just like once every two or three weeks

1329
01:17:24.78 --> 01:17:31.10
Once a month just to keep some of the ideas fresh and also also there's always the possibility that I'll click in your head and you'll realize

1330
01:17:31.58 --> 01:17:34.86
There's like a magical thing that you could get out of the jiu-jitsu

1331
01:17:35.82 --> 01:17:39.26
And it's kind of like waking up, you know waking up at 430 in the morning

1332
01:17:40.30 --> 01:17:46.30
That's what time I wake up and first of all I'm genetically predisposed to sleep less than most people and

1333
01:17:46.30 --> 01:17:49.74
And for instance, we just had daylight savings time and

1334
01:17:51.02 --> 01:17:57.66
Yeah, and so and I went to bed so I set back my clock and it was it was like 940 at night

1335
01:17:57.90 --> 01:18:01.98
So went from 1040 when I was going to bed I set back my clock and now it's 940

1336
01:18:01.98 --> 01:18:04.94
Yeah, that's an all-cooling you know all to sleep extra hour

1337
01:18:06.78 --> 01:18:08.78
We know it's how my woke up like

1338
01:18:09.42 --> 01:18:11.42
248

1339
01:18:11.42 --> 01:18:16.70
And then I I made him bed saying no sleep more sleep more I couldn't do it so I got out of about a 330

1340
01:18:16.70 --> 01:18:20.46
But that's that's that's me and and that's that's just me

1341
01:18:21.66 --> 01:18:22.94
And

1342
01:18:22.94 --> 01:18:28.78
It depends what your schedule is it depends on what your genetic makeup is for sleep and if you work the night shift then obviously

1343
01:18:29.50 --> 01:18:34.54
You're working at 430 in the morning or you're getting off at work of work at 430 morning

1344
01:18:34.54 --> 01:18:36.14
So this just doesn't work and I

1345
01:18:36.14 --> 01:18:41.98
I try and put that caveat on pretty much everything that I say like my workouts

1346
01:18:42.70 --> 01:18:44.70
When I eat

1347
01:18:44.70 --> 01:18:49.90
Everyone's a little bit different and I like what I like and and I do what I do and it works for me and you can try it

1348
01:18:50.22 --> 01:18:51.98
Then if you come up with something that's better

1349
01:18:53.02 --> 01:18:55.02
I'll listen to you

1350
01:18:55.02 --> 01:18:57.42
And that's the same with your juts your man if you hate it

1351
01:18:58.30 --> 01:19:01.42
then you know, maybe it's not for you and and

1352
01:19:01.42 --> 01:19:07.98
You know what I what I truly think might my true thought is it beneficial for you?

1353
01:19:07.98 --> 01:19:09.98
Yes, it is

1354
01:19:09.98 --> 01:19:13.98
Should you stop doing everything that you don't like just because you don't like it? No

1355
01:19:13.98 --> 01:19:19.58
I mean there's some things that you should press on should you get it should everyone have a fundamental level of knowledge of jutsu?

1356
01:19:19.58 --> 01:19:21.58
It's very very beneficial

1357
01:19:21.58 --> 01:19:25.90
But if you hate it and and you've kind of come back conclusion

1358
01:19:25.90 --> 01:19:33.90
then don't do it yeah and and I think also

1359
01:19:34.62 --> 01:19:36.38
Once you give yourself that out

1360
01:19:37.98 --> 01:19:42.38
Once you give yourself the out and you're not forcing yourself to do it anymore

1361
01:19:42.38 --> 01:19:48.70
Yeah, it might open up your mind to actually enjoy it and try it and not be miserable about it. Yes. Yeah

1362
01:19:49.02 --> 01:19:53.58
That's what actually what I was gonna say. I was like it's but they're probably and I don't know

1363
01:19:53.58 --> 01:19:59.74
But easily this some people don't like it straight up. I got I accept that I know I know but

1364
01:20:01.58 --> 01:20:06.86
That being said there is a possibility that the environment that

1365
01:20:07.98 --> 01:20:13.82
This person or that's people training sometimes will make you not like it and it's not necessarily the jutsu

1366
01:20:13.82 --> 01:20:18.06
You don't like sure not it wound up that way you don't like jutsu anymore because you were kind of

1367
01:20:18.62 --> 01:20:20.62
Pushed in the wrong direction as far as like what you

1368
01:20:20.62 --> 01:20:25.90
You like and don't like so you could try a different school try different try different school

1369
01:20:25.90 --> 01:20:30.14
Yeah, like I said earlier today some schools are really strict and rigid and maybe that's

1370
01:20:30.14 --> 01:20:35.18
Would be better for you some schools are real wild and there's no control maybe that that would be a better school

1371
01:20:35.18 --> 01:20:36.54
Depending on what your personality is

1372
01:20:37.26 --> 01:20:41.26
Some people like that regiment and environment. Yeah. Yeah. You could you could definitely try a different school

1373
01:20:41.74 --> 01:20:45.10
But again, I think I think the mental hurtled to come over is

1374
01:20:46.06 --> 01:20:50.22
You've told yourself that you have to do it and now tell yourself you don't have to do it if you don't want to

1375
01:20:50.22 --> 01:20:52.62
But certain in any state try different school

1376
01:20:52.62 --> 01:20:57.34
It's the environment that you train in so the school's part of the environment for sure

1377
01:20:57.34 --> 01:20:59.34
But it's like training partners. It's like the

1378
01:21:00.22 --> 01:21:05.34
Which can lined up as the pressure you put on yourself? It's like everything, you know the whole

1379
01:21:05.50 --> 01:21:10.54
Environment so I know that and people are different people told some people they want that pressure

1380
01:21:10.54 --> 01:21:14.78
They want people yelling you know like remember I used to tell you like when you start coaching either me

1381
01:21:15.34 --> 01:21:19.26
Just in training you know like you'll get fired up when you see two people training or whatever and you'll be like

1382
01:21:19.26 --> 01:21:26.38
Do this really and you'll start coaching it's almost like you're like as a friend you're doing it like just for fun and you're like

1383
01:21:26.38 --> 01:21:30.46
Okay, do this and you usually coach up the other guy when I'm rolling with him and

1384
01:21:31.18 --> 01:21:35.34
That other guy oh he's getting coached by jocco so he turns up the heat and bro

1385
01:21:35.34 --> 01:21:39.50
I don't like that because it's now it's like a thing. I know I don't like that at all

1386
01:21:39.90 --> 01:21:44.14
But some people do like that so people that get some fired up it gets some more in the game, you know

1387
01:21:44.14 --> 01:21:46.14
So I'm saying people are different so

1388
01:21:46.14 --> 01:21:49.42
So the possibility is that this guy

1389
01:21:50.30 --> 01:21:54.80
Happens to be in the wrong environment for you jitsu for him for you to do for him self. Yeah

1390
01:21:54.80 --> 01:21:57.66
Exactly as a possibility and just like I you said

1391
01:21:58.06 --> 01:22:02.90
You know he he could very well be putting that pressure on himself like you have to go and everyone

1392
01:22:02.90 --> 01:22:08.30
Saying how great it is and it's the best thing and if you don't show up to practice you're black and you're lame or get on the best

1393
01:22:08.30 --> 01:22:11.26
You know like if you get told all the time

1394
01:22:11.26 --> 01:22:15.74
It's the best thing in the world and then you show up there and you get beat up which is what happens

1395
01:22:15.74 --> 01:22:18.86
Yes, and you and now you're like how does everyone like this?

1396
01:22:18.86 --> 01:22:22.06
Yeah, this doesn't feel good to me and you just go on a negative mindset right?

1397
01:22:22.06 --> 01:22:27.90
Yeah, so you should be careful that and that's not to mention when you even imply that you don't necessarily like it

1398
01:22:27.90 --> 01:22:31.58
Oh, yeah, because you suck. Oh, yeah, because you're this or you're weaker

1399
01:22:31.58 --> 01:22:35.50
You're whatever you're a slacker like basically all this negativity, you know

1400
01:22:35.50 --> 01:22:42.46
It's gonna turn you off even more so now yeah, you hate it now. Yeah, which which there's a reality of it is some some things

1401
01:22:42.46 --> 01:22:44.46
Don't agree with some people

1402
01:22:44.46 --> 01:22:47.98
Right, that's that's a reality like there's some things in the world

1403
01:22:49.02 --> 01:22:53.42
That that I don't I I just don't like them

1404
01:22:54.06 --> 01:23:00.46
Like when we were driving to LA you're playing some music. Yeah, some of the music that you're playing is is popular music

1405
01:23:01.02 --> 01:23:05.26
I just don't like it. I just don't like it and and

1406
01:23:06.22 --> 01:23:07.98
There's other things like that in the world

1407
01:23:07.98 --> 01:23:13.90
I'm trying to think of things that I just just like other people like them. Yeah, and I just don't like them. I just don't

1408
01:23:14.30 --> 01:23:15.90
Pokemon go

1409
01:23:15.90 --> 01:23:20.62
That's one yeah, I mean, I don't I'm never even thought about Pokemon go. It seems like a cool idea

1410
01:23:20.62 --> 01:23:24.86
You got you look for things on your phone. I mean, oh, I'm not that's not the type of thing that I'm talking about

1411
01:23:27.58 --> 01:23:29.82
You know, I guess dancing at the club

1412
01:23:30.54 --> 01:23:33.42
I mean, I don't care about I'm trying to think of something that some

1413
01:23:34.54 --> 01:23:37.18
I guess music is the best is one of the best examples

1414
01:23:37.18 --> 01:23:43.50
For me is is you know, I hate this certain types of music certain artists

1415
01:23:44.22 --> 01:23:46.22
Like life

1416
01:23:46.22 --> 01:23:48.86
Late late flex hair late flex hair metal from the nine

1417
01:23:49.58 --> 01:23:56.30
The legit likes it and I like legit do not like it and and the reason I use the reason that's a good example

1418
01:23:56.86 --> 01:24:00.70
Is because that's not far off from kind of the music that I do like

1419
01:24:00.70 --> 01:24:05.58
I mean, I like I like I like Led Zeppelin. I mean, I love Led Zeppelin, right?

1420
01:24:05.58 --> 01:24:12.22
Led Zeppelin's awesome and and the step from Led Zeppelin to to to poison

1421
01:24:12.94 --> 01:24:17.34
I mean you could you could they could be in the same record category in the store, right?

1422
01:24:17.90 --> 01:24:21.10
Rock and roll. Yeah, uh, Led Zeppelin. I love

1423
01:24:22.22 --> 01:24:23.10
I

1424
01:24:23.10 --> 01:24:30.30
Poison kind of turns my stomach. I hate it and so that's an example of so some things they just don't sit well with you

1425
01:24:30.94 --> 01:24:34.30
and and maybe jiu-jitsu doesn't sit well with this guy now

1426
01:24:34.30 --> 01:24:39.50
Like I said, I think there's a lot of benefits to it. I think you get it a lot out of it try a different environment

1427
01:24:39.50 --> 01:24:45.02
But if you hate it, don't make force yourself to do it open open the escape

1428
01:24:45.34 --> 01:24:52.14
Right give yourself an out and that allows you to feel more comfortable because you feel trapped everyone feels like a cornered animal

1429
01:24:52.14 --> 01:24:56.14
And now you're just pissed off. Yeah, you if you've been like hey these guys everyone

1430
01:24:56.14 --> 01:25:00.22
I hear everyone talking about your jiu-jitsu, so I'm gonna try it. Yeah, and now your first day. You don't like it

1431
01:25:00.46 --> 01:25:02.86
But you're like I'm gonna keep doing it because everyone's saying it's great

1432
01:25:02.86 --> 01:25:07.90
And you just end up in a bad way. Yeah, so be careful with that one. Yeah, you're gonna trap

1433
01:25:07.90 --> 01:25:14.78
Do with it with the junk parts of it. Yeah, that kind of came about and yeah, and you can't really escape it then you're like

1434
01:25:15.26 --> 01:25:17.26
Rebelligance it

1435
01:25:18.78 --> 01:25:26.46
Yeah, check remember when we were driving up to LA. I was playing carry by Europe that is actually technically at 80s

1436
01:25:26.46 --> 01:25:32.62
Hair metal. Yeah, that's an easy for sure, but you're really mad. Yeah, yeah

1437
01:25:32.62 --> 01:25:36.06
No, I'm telling you that music doesn't sit well with me for some reason you got a little bit

1438
01:25:36.06 --> 01:25:40.70
And I'm going back to life like layflakes Metallica layflakes black Sabbath layflakes tool

1439
01:25:41.02 --> 01:25:46.14
He likes rocking bands too yeah for some reason there's some genetic code in his head that poisoned's cool

1440
01:25:46.14 --> 01:25:48.14
Yeah, just let's it right in

1441
01:25:48.54 --> 01:25:54.78
Mine gets the and hole yeah, but then I guess on the other end of the spectrum you get we get into music that

1442
01:25:54.78 --> 01:26:02.38
Life and like like life like Spantara, Panterra is a hard band now. I go one step further than Pantara right in some of the some of the music that I listen to

1443
01:26:03.42 --> 01:26:08.86
Which I think leaves life a little bit where he wouldn't listen to some of the harder music that I listen to

1444
01:26:08.86 --> 01:26:12.86
But Pantara was you know brushing up against it. Hey, do you listen to soft music?

1445
01:26:13.42 --> 01:26:18.22
Come on. What do you consider soft music? That's something about love songs. I don't know so you know

1446
01:26:18.62 --> 01:26:20.62
Something soft you know what I'm seeing

1447
01:26:20.62 --> 01:26:27.66
I'd say white buffalo white buffalo is hard acoustic music, but you know he's got some pretty melos songs

1448
01:26:27.66 --> 01:26:32.86
He got a song called love song number one. What's it about though like is he is it like romantic?

1449
01:26:32.86 --> 01:26:37.34
You know, is he talking about? Yeah, he's love. I would say yes a girl or something like that. I would say yes

1450
01:26:38.06 --> 01:26:43.10
He kind of does account because you know how like well how can that not count? I don't know because you know how like like

1451
01:26:43.74 --> 01:26:48.94
Metallica for example. They have unforgiving right so it sounds softer, but they're still talking about hard stuff

1452
01:26:49.42 --> 01:26:50.38
Okay

1453
01:26:50.38 --> 01:26:55.98
And then they have like enter San Man which is okay. Well, and I guess I'm just not no my answer to you is no

1454
01:26:56.54 --> 01:27:03.22
Like do you like what about Zeppelin but I won't see you're still talking about like these aren't soft things like you know

1455
01:27:03.22 --> 01:27:08.06
Okay, so I'll explain algebra remember remember algebra and you're like what the

1456
01:27:09.34 --> 01:27:13.26
Yes, you're pissed you're mad at me personally like you

1457
01:27:14.54 --> 01:27:19.18
And you're like who is this and no no, you know what though actually I played another song

1458
01:27:19.18 --> 01:27:21.18
Ah, who was it?

1459
01:27:21.18 --> 01:27:27.02
He was like Josh Radin or something and you were like hey, this is pretty good. I was very surprised. It was a soft song

1460
01:27:27.66 --> 01:27:32.46
Okay, do you remember that's well my musical taste are very yeah

1461
01:27:32.46 --> 01:27:36.46
Different types of music. Yeah, so I guess sometimes types of music that I don't like yeah

1462
01:27:37.02 --> 01:27:42.06
I sometimes wonder with you like if you're the kind you know how some people they they just just I like music

1463
01:27:42.30 --> 01:27:47.34
Not I'm not saying me. I'm just saying certain people they are into just a specific type of music

1464
01:27:47.34 --> 01:27:53.10
That's it that's the whole reason for music in their head is like this very specific feeling like some people

1465
01:27:53.66 --> 01:28:00.46
That I know before they they only like house music they aren't like anything other than house music

1466
01:28:00.46 --> 01:28:03.50
Yeah, it's like it's just they old brother listen to nothing

1467
01:28:04.06 --> 01:28:08.14
So I was wondering if you were like kind of that kind of where because I was in all different kinds of music

1468
01:28:08.70 --> 01:28:10.70
Well least just not

1469
01:28:10.70 --> 01:28:16.78
Maybe not all different yeah, no, okay, you're right. I listened to a wide range of various types sure

1470
01:28:17.82 --> 01:28:19.10
There you go

1471
01:28:19.10 --> 01:28:23.42
Not elder or although I forget the song, but you was you can refer back to it later

1472
01:28:24.38 --> 01:28:26.38
Other time cool

1473
01:28:27.42 --> 01:28:29.42
All right next question how about that

1474
01:28:33.66 --> 01:28:37.58
Kind of feel bad for the guy who hates do you get to that's kind of crazy. Yeah, it's a bummer

1475
01:28:37.58 --> 01:28:45.34
But it's it's not that rare. Yeah, makes sense. It totally makes it and I was actually talking with you know Dave came around sure

1476
01:28:45.34 --> 01:28:47.34
I know who that is yeah, well

1477
01:28:47.34 --> 01:28:52.46
I was up with him up in San Francisco area yesterday and

1478
01:28:53.02 --> 01:28:56.14
We were talking about how some people don't like jiu-jitsu

1479
01:28:56.14 --> 01:29:00.94
Yeah, and you'd think even people that are you would think would like jiu-jitsu

1480
01:29:01.58 --> 01:29:03.58
People that have jobs that

1481
01:29:03.58 --> 01:29:11.42
Jiu-jitsu would be really beneficial for them to know yeah, they don't like jiu-jitsu and and so and I was saying that

1482
01:29:11.74 --> 01:29:16.70
I've introduced a lot of people to jiu-jitsu a lot of people to jiu-jitsu

1483
01:29:17.26 --> 01:29:22.06
Not many of them have actually stuck with it for a long period of time yeah, but and and so

1484
01:29:22.78 --> 01:29:24.78
It's not that rare

1485
01:29:24.78 --> 01:29:30.38
For people to not like jiu-jitsu. Yeah, and I I dig it's like not sticking with it because jiu-jitsu takes work

1486
01:29:30.38 --> 01:29:37.34
It's not like the easy thing that they provide just someone oh your size difference between not like in jiu-jitsu and not actually sticking with it

1487
01:29:37.34 --> 01:29:42.62
Yes, so this guy straight up. I hate it. Yeah, yeah, that's something that's a little bit more powerful

1488
01:29:42.62 --> 01:29:47.26
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like definitely doesn't like people don't stick with it for the most part

1489
01:29:47.26 --> 01:29:52.06
This is just a total guess on my point. Yeah, lazy and like discipline. Yeah, like they're they just they

1490
01:29:52.94 --> 01:29:58.46
They don't like it enough on in on a kind of moment to moment basis to get off the couch and go

1491
01:29:58.46 --> 01:30:01.74
That's kind of it. No, it's one of those situations

1492
01:30:03.50 --> 01:30:04.78
Next question

1493
01:30:04.78 --> 01:30:11.90
Jockel I have a question after reading your book which I thought was one of the best books. I've read since your last book

1494
01:30:12.46 --> 01:30:13.66
Nice

1495
01:30:13.66 --> 01:30:19.58
I'm curious what what you did during your sealed team days to maintain your your schedule

1496
01:30:19.58 --> 01:30:27.50
As I would imagine in the teams your schedule changes at any minute to include you being deployed or active during your various missions at night

1497
01:30:28.62 --> 01:30:34.38
So as in life how do you keep your balance of your schedule when do you call in your book?

1498
01:30:34.38 --> 01:30:35.98
You say

1499
01:30:35.98 --> 01:30:39.90
Keep your schedule but how did you work through this when you

1500
01:30:40.70 --> 01:30:43.74
Would be on a mission that didn't allow you to sleep at night?

1501
01:30:43.74 --> 01:30:48.94
Did you still did you still the following day upon return maintain your normal schedule

1502
01:30:48.94 --> 01:30:50.94
Appreciate your time and response okay

1503
01:30:50.94 --> 01:30:57.18
Yeah, obviously the teams your schedule and the teams can vary a lot and you have to adopt to what makes sense and

1504
01:30:57.18 --> 01:31:03.02
Sometimes in the teams you're working 18 20 hour days sometimes out in the field you're going to the field for two three four five days at a time

1505
01:31:04.06 --> 01:31:05.50
Sometimes

1506
01:31:05.50 --> 01:31:10.06
You're working for 24 hours a day or you work for 36 hours straight because you do planning in the bubble

1507
01:31:10.06 --> 01:31:13.02
Was so that could be wrong with sometimes you're doing dives

1508
01:31:13.34 --> 01:31:15.34
You're doing two dives a day and

1509
01:31:15.34 --> 01:31:20.22
That takes a bunch of time and it takes a toll on you. It's hard work. I guess you could say

1510
01:31:21.26 --> 01:31:23.50
Sometimes we're running around all day or all night

1511
01:31:24.14 --> 01:31:28.14
Running around the desert running around the urban training facility and

1512
01:31:28.70 --> 01:31:33.34
So the schedule's changing all the time and it's the same thing with business the same thing with business

1513
01:31:33.34 --> 01:31:36.78
Right now I travel and the flight leaves early the flight leaves late or the work all day

1514
01:31:36.78 --> 01:31:42.62
Are they dinner with the clients or the interview with a writing or the the recording of the podcast or the changing time zones and things just change

1515
01:31:42.62 --> 01:31:50.22
And so what what I do is yes, I try and I try and keep the schedules much as I can and if I fall off the schedule for whatever reason

1516
01:31:50.22 --> 01:31:52.62
I get back on it as quickly as possible and

1517
01:31:53.34 --> 01:31:59.26
I think so so yes, you do the best you can. I think the main thing you have to watch out for is letting

1518
01:32:00.30 --> 01:32:02.30
Letting a change in schedule

1519
01:32:02.86 --> 01:32:04.86
Or a problem in your schedule

1520
01:32:05.34 --> 01:32:09.50
Being excuse to fall off the path, right that's what you have to watch out for

1521
01:32:09.50 --> 01:32:15.10
You know we think oh I'm in a new time zone or I've got jet lag or I didn't sleep well

1522
01:32:15.10 --> 01:32:21.74
Or I need rest from traveling or I did this the other night and so I'm gonna sleep until 930 tomorrow morning and just call it good

1523
01:32:22.46 --> 01:32:26.46
That's what you have to watch out for now sometimes you need to work to 9th these sleep till 930 yeah

1524
01:32:26.70 --> 01:32:31.98
Sometimes you do sometimes you stay up for 36 hours you go to bed at three o'clock in the morning

1525
01:32:32.14 --> 01:32:37.34
Guess what you might need to sleep until 930 that's cool good do it get some sleep

1526
01:32:37.34 --> 01:32:39.34
But just be careful of

1527
01:32:40.38 --> 01:32:42.38
Using it as an excuse

1528
01:32:43.18 --> 01:32:47.50
To go way off the path and just get yourself back on the path as soon as possible

1529
01:32:49.18 --> 01:32:51.18
Makes sense yes, sir

1530
01:32:51.42 --> 01:32:57.18
Yeah, that's all me right there like one little thing on my schedule throws up on this whole day is gone. I'll do tomorrow

1531
01:32:58.78 --> 01:33:00.78
He's got a careful net

1532
01:33:00.78 --> 01:33:02.14
Speaking of schedule

1533
01:33:02.14 --> 01:33:07.10
I think we're about good for questions. There's one more thing that I wanted to close out with and you know

1534
01:33:07.10 --> 01:33:10.54
I get a lot of I get a lot of really a great

1535
01:33:11.98 --> 01:33:13.98
emails I got a lot of great

1536
01:33:15.74 --> 01:33:18.06
Messages through social media

1537
01:33:19.02 --> 01:33:23.18
Letters written letters get all those kinds of things and I appreciate them all

1538
01:33:23.82 --> 01:33:29.18
I don't always respond to all them because I physically cannot do it and you know of course

1539
01:33:29.18 --> 01:33:33.18
You know oh get someone to manage your social media or whatever not doing that

1540
01:33:33.18 --> 01:33:39.18
If you hear back from me you hear from me not from somebody that I paid

1541
01:33:39.74 --> 01:33:44.14
$10 an hour to respond to my stuff and say cool get after it like no

1542
01:33:45.42 --> 01:33:47.42
Not doing that but

1543
01:33:48.06 --> 01:33:54.46
You know I get all these things and I do read them so if you send it I read it and so I appreciate the feedback and everything

1544
01:33:55.50 --> 01:33:58.70
I got one though that I that was good. I wanted to

1545
01:33:58.70 --> 01:34:03.42
Actually wanted to read on here because I felt that it not only

1546
01:34:04.22 --> 01:34:06.06
Said hey thanks for you know

1547
01:34:06.30 --> 01:34:12.78
The podcast or whatever and thanks for the books whatever it actually gave some pretty good methodology and really an insight into a

1548
01:34:13.02 --> 01:34:15.66
mindset that I think will help people

1549
01:34:16.62 --> 01:34:18.62
Doing what they're doing so

1550
01:34:18.62 --> 01:34:22.06
Here we go Mr. Willink just wanted to share a quick story with you

1551
01:34:22.06 --> 01:34:28.62
At 39 I had fallen into a 15-year rut of undisciplined alcoholism

1552
01:34:29.66 --> 01:34:32.30
I was soft and heavy and wanted to change

1553
01:34:33.58 --> 01:34:37.66
Earlier this year I had started working out three to four times a week in my basement

1554
01:34:38.62 --> 01:34:45.82
I was trying and failing to get a handle on my alcohol abuse and every failure made the beast seem bigger and unbeatable

1555
01:34:46.94 --> 01:34:48.94
It was like I didn't have control over my body

1556
01:34:48.94 --> 01:34:50.94
I

1557
01:34:50.94 --> 01:34:56.06
Finished your book on a Monday night and decided that I would get up early the next morning and work out

1558
01:34:57.50 --> 01:34:59.50
I got up and worked out

1559
01:34:59.82 --> 01:35:01.98
Not much but I just wanted to do something

1560
01:35:03.18 --> 01:35:05.82
Sit-ups pushups 15 minutes on the bike

1561
01:35:07.34 --> 01:35:09.34
Worked out twice Tuesday

1562
01:35:10.46 --> 01:35:12.46
Got up Wednesday and did it again

1563
01:35:12.46 --> 01:35:18.38
Got to Thursday night a normal drinking night and decided to try not drinking

1564
01:35:20.14 --> 01:35:22.14
Made it through

1565
01:35:22.46 --> 01:35:27.66
Friday same thing worked out morning and night stayed busy and stayed away from the drink

1566
01:35:29.98 --> 01:35:31.82
Falled I should try and push it through the weekend

1567
01:35:33.02 --> 01:35:35.02
Worked out Saturday morning

1568
01:35:35.26 --> 01:35:37.26
Took the rest of the weekend often stayed dry

1569
01:35:37.26 --> 01:35:41.90
Monday morning I got up and started two days again

1570
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:46.86
Made it through the week with 11 workouts

1571
01:35:48.62 --> 01:35:52.30
By the second week I felt better than I had in my entire life

1572
01:35:53.58 --> 01:35:56.78
I was astounded that normal people walked around feeling this good

1573
01:35:58.30 --> 01:35:59.26
I guess not

1574
01:35:59.26 --> 01:36:01.98
systematically poisoning your body will do that

1575
01:36:01.98 --> 01:36:08.38
On the fifth week I got a project at work that was going to require traveling for the next eight weeks

1576
01:36:09.74 --> 01:36:13.42
I was worried about overcoming my triggers and road habits

1577
01:36:14.78 --> 01:36:19.34
But normal traveling evening was dinner watch cable and drink eight beers

1578
01:36:20.94 --> 01:36:25.18
To my surprise the hotel at a sweet gym cool. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing

1579
01:36:26.62 --> 01:36:30.54
Then at the site I found out that we would start work at 6 a.m

1580
01:36:30.54 --> 01:36:34.46
Damn that means I have to get up at four to work out

1581
01:36:36.70 --> 01:36:42.78
On 12 weeks into my traveling two a days usually getting 11 to 12 workouts a week

1582
01:36:43.66 --> 01:36:48.78
They recently moved our start time to 7 a.m. so now I get an hour and a half in the morning and evening

1583
01:36:50.30 --> 01:36:52.30
I'm 16 weeks clean

1584
01:36:52.94 --> 01:36:56.46
Drop 30 pounds or more haven't been on a scale in three weeks

1585
01:36:56.46 --> 01:37:00.46
34 waste jeans hang off of me

1586
01:37:01.66 --> 01:37:06.06
My sit up and push-up sets went from 10 to 40 to 50

1587
01:37:07.10 --> 01:37:11.66
Kettabel swings went from 35 by 10 to 50 by 15

1588
01:37:13.58 --> 01:37:17.74
I started to learn how to run as I haven't done it in 20 years

1589
01:37:19.18 --> 01:37:22.14
Now after a day off I can do two miles without stopping

1590
01:37:22.14 --> 01:37:29.26
I do four to five miles on the treadmill and nine miles on the bike besides the sit-ups push-ups

1591
01:37:29.66 --> 01:37:32.06
Kettelbells core and weights

1592
01:37:34.14 --> 01:37:37.90
I look forward to next year's competitive shooting season. I'm going to bring it

1593
01:37:39.26 --> 01:37:43.90
At this point my cravings are gone and I actually recoil from the smell of booze

1594
01:37:45.98 --> 01:37:48.30
When I started this I thought it would be temporary

1595
01:37:48.30 --> 01:37:54.30
Now it's going to be permanent no reason to waste time with it anymore

1596
01:37:56.22 --> 01:38:00.78
Now when I question something your voice comes to me with the hard answer

1597
01:38:02.38 --> 01:38:04.38
It's only black and white with no gray area

1598
01:38:06.86 --> 01:38:13.42
One day when I'm standing before the lured lord and here is voice if it doesn't sound like yours I might be disappointed

1599
01:38:13.42 --> 01:38:21.02
The book I read those months ago was the way of the warrior kid

1600
01:38:23.02 --> 01:38:24.86
I'm working on extreme ownership now

1601
01:38:26.86 --> 01:38:30.62
Thank you for your service. Thank you for producing a badass podcast

1602
01:38:31.42 --> 01:38:33.90
Thank you for influencing my life

1603
01:38:38.22 --> 01:38:40.22
So

1604
01:38:40.22 --> 01:38:42.22
There you go

1605
01:38:43.74 --> 01:38:45.74
And I say this to people all the time

1606
01:38:48.38 --> 01:38:51.26
Most important here is it isn't me

1607
01:38:54.30 --> 01:38:55.58
It's you and

1608
01:38:56.30 --> 01:39:01.26
Sure you may have grabbed some little foot hold from the podcast or from one of the books

1609
01:39:01.58 --> 01:39:04.70
But it isn't me that changes you it's you

1610
01:39:04.70 --> 01:39:06.70
You

1611
01:39:07.66 --> 01:39:16.30
You set the small goals you achieve those goals then set some more and achieve those and set some more goals

1612
01:39:16.30 --> 01:39:18.70
Maybe a little bit bigger, but not that much bigger

1613
01:39:21.58 --> 01:39:24.86
You pay attention to the progress this guy is 16 weeks deep

1614
01:39:27.50 --> 01:39:29.50
30 pounds lighter

1615
01:39:29.50 --> 01:39:34.06
Working harder stronger faster more efficient competitive

1616
01:39:37.18 --> 01:39:44.78
The individual that wrote that is getting after it and changing his life and you can too

1617
01:39:47.90 --> 01:39:49.90
Just start

One little victory at a time

1625
01:40:19.18 --> 01:40:24.94
Appreciate the letter and I think that's all I've got for tonight

1626
01:40:24.94 --> 01:40:29.18
So echo speaking of people getting

1627
01:40:30.14 --> 01:40:32.94
Better stronger and faster

1628
01:40:34.62 --> 01:40:41.26
And actually supporting the podcast if they want to do that sure do you have any suggestions for us sure of course

1629
01:40:41.26 --> 01:40:43.26
I do

1630
01:40:43.82 --> 01:40:49.26
I can talk about the fact that origin has a new key coming out

1631
01:40:51.74 --> 01:40:53.74
Good on

1632
01:40:53.74 --> 01:40:57.74
I don't know that the name of the you know keys have names

1633
01:40:58.30 --> 01:41:02.70
You know like the origin does yeah, yeah, you know

1634
01:41:02.70 --> 01:41:06.30
That's a cool name do by the vaccine, but this one is called I think

1635
01:41:07.10 --> 01:41:11.50
Discipline I think it's called discipline. I think it might be called discipline. Yeah

1636
01:41:12.38 --> 01:41:19.26
Not the discipline. This is just this discipline. I could be called that sure you could check it out origin main dot com right yeah

1637
01:41:20.06 --> 01:41:22.06
surprisingly

1638
01:41:22.06 --> 01:41:23.66
aesthetically

1639
01:41:23.66 --> 01:41:25.66
Great

1640
01:41:27.74 --> 01:41:30.38
I would say it's I would say it's probably

1641
01:41:32.22 --> 01:41:40.38
Is the term they use like on brand on brand meaning it kind of fits fits your brand okay sure

1642
01:41:41.02 --> 01:41:45.10
It does that yeah, yeah, yeah, it totally does it um

1643
01:41:46.78 --> 01:41:50.22
It's like yeah, it's not the kind where you know like some keys like

1644
01:41:50.22 --> 01:41:55.58
You look at them you can tell there's like all these bells and whistles as far as decorations go

1645
01:41:55.58 --> 01:42:00.38
You know, yeah, it's a good word decorations. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so but he's looking for decorations

1646
01:42:00.38 --> 01:42:05.18
Here's the thing though. There are some there are some uh how should I say functional

1647
01:42:05.98 --> 01:42:12.38
Decorations and now that's not actually a good word for it anyway. It looks cool put it that way it looks cool

1648
01:42:12.78 --> 01:42:14.78
You know basically

1649
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:16.78
Kind of lighter weight one

1650
01:42:16.78 --> 01:42:23.42
For functionality but awesome nonetheless look at it. I got a way one

1651
01:42:24.06 --> 01:42:26.06
I know you got the black one

1652
01:42:26.38 --> 01:42:32.30
How do you know I don't have both yeah, I'm sure you do have both and I'm still working on the black one but that's a long story

1653
01:42:33.10 --> 01:42:35.10
nonetheless it's a good one and

1654
01:42:36.54 --> 01:42:41.42
Like back when we first started everyone would ask and I don't want to say everyone but a lot of people

1655
01:42:42.46 --> 01:42:44.46
You know, I don't like I

1656
01:42:44.46 --> 01:42:46.46
Don't say that yeah a lot of people

1657
01:42:46.46 --> 01:42:51.58
I say some people some people some people but the thing is a lot of people though it's like a lot of people

Two times a week for two years by the way that's a lot of people

1663
01:43:10.78 --> 01:43:14.70
Asking the same exact question anyway. They asked like oh what kind of geese should I get it?

1678
01:44:27.34 --> 01:44:30.70
Yeah, even if you're not looking for a geey just look at this brand and pick worth

01:44:30.70 --> 01:44:35.10
E he he said on Twitter he's gonna get the geey even though he's not training jiu-jitsu

01:44:35.98 --> 01:44:42.38
And then actually I have I didn't respond to brand and but I'll respond right now get the geey and

1684
01:44:51.54 --> 01:44:53.90
I get that's my bet. I would

1685
01:44:54.62 --> 01:45:00.30
I almost am challenging him to prove me wrong. That's how my journey went and proved to everyone that he could do a hundred

1686
01:45:00.30 --> 01:45:03.66
Burpees in ten minutes. Yeah, he's challenged for him. It's hard for him. Yeah, but he did it

1687
01:45:03.66 --> 01:45:07.02
Yeah, and that was his original challenge. I'm gonna sit on the mat. Yeah

1688
01:45:07.26 --> 01:45:13.74
He's gonna you can't just get the geey when you put it on and this goes for pretty much any like legitimate geey when you put it on your

1689
01:45:13.74 --> 01:45:14.94
You want to

1690
01:45:14.94 --> 01:45:22.06
All right, and this is true like you're like we we didn't mean like a data happens all the time when you had you put on the geey

1691
01:45:22.06 --> 01:45:25.58
Just don't you and when you grab it you're like all the time

1692
01:45:25.58 --> 01:45:27.18
You know kind of thing yeah, same thing with the sun

1693
01:45:27.18 --> 01:45:39.98
Same exacting yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1694
01:45:39.98 --> 01:45:46.06
The last yeah, so it comes from origin if you didn't already picked that part up origin main dot com

1695
01:45:46.06 --> 01:45:52.54
There's a lot of geyslons there even if you want to get a another one other than the you don't want to do

1696
01:45:52.54 --> 01:45:59.34
I have all the patches that you know how like like knock a no-one in and you know

1697
01:45:59.34 --> 01:46:05.18
They'll give you like their police patches stuff like that. I'm gonna have all of them on Mickey all of them

1698
01:46:05.66 --> 01:46:07.66
How many do you have

1699
01:46:07.66 --> 01:46:10.30
About 12 okay, because I have like 90

1700
01:46:12.30 --> 01:46:18.78
I've got so many awesome patches from fire departments police departments military units all over the country foreign

1701
01:46:19.18 --> 01:46:21.50
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff that would be a biggie

1702
01:46:21.50 --> 01:46:27.90
Yeah, you got to put them on multiple geys if you got the black ant noise. Yeah, well, it wasn't ever from

1703
01:46:28.54 --> 01:46:34.46
A lot of patches bro. Yeah, yeah, and there's certain places you can't really put them to so that even limits you more

1704
01:46:35.42 --> 01:46:39.90
But I'm doing it. I'm starting it and if I run out of space I'm getting another geid boom

1705
01:46:39.90 --> 01:46:41.90
I'm gonna keep it going

1706
01:46:41.90 --> 01:46:50.30
I do kind of risk people saying hey you're not law enforcement. Why are you wearing that patch like some of those patches to me seem like you like you can be a NASA one

1707
01:46:50.30 --> 01:46:55.42
Like that's yeah, do shoot should I even wearing this patch? Yeah, we got we got friends at NASA

1708
01:46:56.78 --> 01:46:59.50
I'm gonna wear it. I was hit this is from my friends at NASA

1709
01:47:00.06 --> 01:47:02.06
Yeah, great up

1710
01:47:02.38 --> 01:47:09.58
Anyway, you know, I back to origin origin. That's all American made stuff from look cotton out of the ground American

1711
01:47:11.50 --> 01:47:15.34
To the factory American factory in America in America in Maine

1712
01:47:15.34 --> 01:47:20.78
Mm-hmm make the material make the clothing make the geys make the rash guards

1713
01:47:21.50 --> 01:47:29.42
Make the one else to there some bags and yeah, yeah Jim bags and whatnot accessories. I believe they're called accessories

1714
01:47:29.66 --> 01:47:36.46
Yeah, they're like beanies and these shirts all made in America. Yeah, I think when I told Jordan Peterson that I think he liked it

1715
01:47:37.02 --> 01:47:40.70
Even though he's not American yeah, yeah, yeah, and the supplements

1716
01:47:41.34 --> 01:47:42.30
Yeah

1717
01:47:42.30 --> 01:47:46.22
From origin labs yeah those are jocquoise supplements so

1718
01:47:47.42 --> 01:47:56.54
Here's the thing I'm gonna I'll go into the details later, but superkrill there is a legitimate difference between superkrill in regular krill oil

1719
01:47:57.02 --> 01:48:02.14
There is and it's very beneficial. I'm not gonna say right now, but just no superkrill oil

1720
01:48:03.42 --> 01:48:05.66
Jocquill brand joint warfare

1721
01:48:05.66 --> 01:48:11.42
Jocquill brand for your joints supplements boom jocquill came out with it. That's the stuff

1722
01:48:12.30 --> 01:48:17.02
From the beginning that was the main supplements, you know joint stuff krill oil

1723
01:48:18.22 --> 01:48:23.58
You're the number one reason not even the number the only reason I started taking it and I'm kind of mad

1724
01:48:23.58 --> 01:48:28.14
I didn't take it before yeah, you were behind yeah, and now you got your own one which is even better

1725
01:48:28.14 --> 01:48:35.34
Yeah, it's super as a matter of fact. Yeah, but it's not just a name and I'll just enjoy it. We're fair the joint warfare as a

1726
01:48:35.82 --> 01:48:42.54
Let's imagine getting sure in my opinion sure and and in my shoulders opinion yeah left shoulder

1727
01:48:43.26 --> 01:48:50.38
Both of my shoulders my back and my elbows so yeah, or do me that calm that's the place to go also

1728
01:48:51.50 --> 01:48:54.70
Some legitimate fitness gear everyone knows I'm into kettle bells now

1729
01:48:54.70 --> 01:48:56.70
I

1730
01:48:56.94 --> 01:49:00.02
Get mine from on it. They're the cool one straight up. That's it. I

1731
01:49:00.86 --> 01:49:02.86
Don't think I

1732
01:49:02.86 --> 01:49:06.46
Could go back to regular kettle bells. It's my opinion

1733
01:49:06.86 --> 01:49:11.98
Got the where we've got the big foot 90 pounds two pounds heavier than jocquill's heaviest kettle bell

1734
01:49:12.54 --> 01:49:16.62
Every rep. I think Jordan Peterson was impressed with that too, by the way. Yeah, he was

1735
01:49:17.74 --> 01:49:19.74
That makes one of us

1736
01:49:19.74 --> 01:49:25.74

1754
01:50:50.06 --> 01:50:56.78
The video version of this podcast. Yeah, but one still and I still do get the the whole thing like oh echo

1755
01:50:56.78 --> 01:50:58.78
You don't look like you sound and

1756
01:51:00.14 --> 01:51:02.70
I remember changing the way you talk yeah, yeah

1757
01:51:03.74 --> 01:51:05.74
Or change the way I look

1758
01:51:05.74 --> 01:51:08.14
You know get skinny yeah

1759
01:51:08.86 --> 01:51:11.18
Get less jacked that is

1760
01:51:12.14 --> 01:51:17.90
It is kind of an intuitive a YouTube comments like one out of every 20 YouTube comments is

1761
01:51:18.54 --> 01:51:20.54
Echo's jacked

1762
01:51:21.74 --> 01:51:29.82
Yeah, that's funny. It kind of is because you wouldn't think that you could determine what someone looks like by what they sound like but it feels like you can

1763
01:51:30.22 --> 01:51:31.82
I think a lot of times you can

1764
01:51:31.82 --> 01:51:37.26
I don't know though actually now that you think about like talk show hosts on radios. Yeah, you don't know what yeah

1765
01:51:37.26 --> 01:51:42.78
It's okay. I guess it's uh it's it's harder to do than you think yeah it feels like you can

1766
01:51:42.78 --> 01:51:47.74
Yeah, you can like if someone has like a I don't know like a deep voice you think they're huge or something

1767
01:51:47.74 --> 01:51:53.74
You know like something like that not necessarily true. Yeah not true at all remember that sign filled one

1768
01:51:54.14 --> 01:51:56.14
No, they're the guys like

1769
01:51:56.14 --> 01:52:05.90
She I think Elaine is the girl in their youth like she's like oh he had a a good looking voice or something like he sounded like he was good looking or something like that

1770
01:52:05.90 --> 01:52:07.90
How to turn out

1771
01:52:07.90 --> 01:52:14.46
I forget I think you were telling that story you need to remember it. Yeah the analogy I didn't remember it

1772
01:52:14.46 --> 01:52:17.10
But it reminded me of that nonetheless

1773
01:52:17.50 --> 01:52:19.10

1776
01:52:27.02 --> 01:52:33.74
Barely maybe a little bit I guess maybe I sit because if I see you out in the wild

1777
01:52:34.38 --> 01:52:38.06
It'll you know we can recognize each other if you know what I look like that

1778
01:52:39.34 --> 01:52:43.74
There's times when people recognize you and you'll like say oh yeah this is echo Charles

1779
01:52:43.74 --> 01:52:47.18
Yeah, tell on their face. They're like oh, are you sure that this is echo?

1780
01:52:47.18 --> 01:52:49.66
Yeah, I kind of think I've encountered that

1781
01:52:50.22 --> 01:52:52.22

01:53:16.46 --> 01:53:18.46
High quality

1791
01:53:18.46 --> 01:53:21.10
Layers too by the way the good is backwards

1792
01:53:21.10 --> 01:53:24.30
To look at in the mirror that message is for you

1793
01:53:25.66 --> 01:53:32.30
If you think about the whole message of good, I mean, I know you said it you know you're like good kind of thing

1794
01:53:32.70 --> 01:53:38.54
But you were kind of like you guys had the the luxury of you being there to be able to explain it

1795
01:53:39.90 --> 01:53:42.22
If someone's going through like something hard it's

1796
01:53:43.90 --> 01:53:47.82
You can't just automatically just say good it kind of comes off kind of weird

1797
01:53:48.46 --> 01:53:50.46
Yeah, potentially

1798
01:53:50.46 --> 01:53:55.82
That's why I put this backwards because it's like you tell yourself good. You seem saying that's the layer

1799
01:53:55.82 --> 01:54:01.82
That's the little inside to the layer. I'm not gonna go deep and I'm not gonna go into any of the other explanations for the other layers

1800
01:54:01.82 --> 01:54:05.90
But just know that they have layers on all the clothing on jaco store.com

1801
01:54:06.78 --> 01:54:11.02
Check it out. I'm not saying to buy something. I'm saying go on there look on there if you like something

1802
01:54:11.82 --> 01:54:14.30
Get something good way to support this away and stuff on there

1803
01:54:15.18 --> 01:54:17.18
T-shirts like I said some patches

1804
01:54:17.18 --> 01:54:24.70
Rashcards for jitsu or anything physical cycling anything requiring range of motion

1805
01:54:25.18 --> 01:54:27.18
Maybe some compression situations

1806
01:54:28.86 --> 01:54:32.86
High aesthetic value, but not too high because it's more about functionality

1807
01:54:34.06 --> 01:54:38.46
That's my take on all do but they do look good and they have layers

1808
01:54:39.18 --> 01:54:41.18
Who do you are in?

1809
01:54:41.18 --> 01:54:46.70
Being shipped out right now. They're in heavy. Do you have one no? No. I'm sorry

1810
01:54:49.50 --> 01:54:53.74
Well, we aren't California so yeah, but it's not that big of a deal

1811
01:54:54.46 --> 01:54:59.26
You got your old one. It's all good. Oh, but yeah. There's some hoodies on there. Uh some warrior kids

1812
01:55:00.62 --> 01:55:02.46
Rashcards are coming

1813
01:55:02.46 --> 01:55:08.46
Boom because people have been asking me about that because I wore one that was like a test one and they wore one while streamed deep

1814
01:55:08.46 --> 01:55:11.82
Deeper and they're like all warrior kid Rashcards, you know whatever

1815
01:55:11.82 --> 01:55:17.42
But I was trying to narrow down kind of the colors and stuff, but they're narrowed down and they should be available within the next

1816
01:55:18.22 --> 01:55:22.06
We can out where those made those are made all in America

1817
01:55:22.62 --> 01:55:29.42
All in America warrior kid Rashcards also there's another kind of cool fun one, but I want to talk about that one till later

1818
01:55:30.62 --> 01:55:32.06
Also

1819
01:55:32.06 --> 01:55:37.10
Good way to support yourself psychological warfare if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks

1820
01:55:37.10 --> 01:55:42.62
Jockel tracks and there are two aid you in the event of you needing aid

1821
01:55:43.26 --> 01:55:47.50
in your campaigning and sweetness on your path on the path

1822
01:55:49.42 --> 01:55:52.94
Okay, so here's the thing about the path. It's not always gonna be easy

1823
01:55:53.98 --> 01:55:59.98
You don't see I know what you're saying yeah every day man this is not a one day gig

1824
01:56:01.66 --> 01:56:03.66
This isn't every day

1825
01:56:03.66 --> 01:56:06.86
Every day is a Monday yeah on the path

1826
01:56:07.82 --> 01:56:12.94
Here's I will say this though. Okay, so and you you read the letter for the guy with drinking

1827
01:56:12.94 --> 01:56:17.10
I could I could relate to that deeply deeply could relate to that and

1828
01:56:18.38 --> 01:56:22.78
In a way and I don't go to deep into it, but in a way the my situation was

1829
01:56:23.66 --> 01:56:28.22
In a way harder because the drinking wasn't preventing me from working out

1830
01:56:28.22 --> 01:56:33.10
It wasn't preventing me from doing like a lot of stuff. It was only preventing me from doing like a handful of things

1831
01:56:33.26 --> 01:56:35.26
But those things I really

1832
01:56:35.26 --> 01:56:40.06
Wanted to do, but it was really preventing me or it was put it this way. It was making it super difficult

1833
01:56:40.38 --> 01:56:44.78
And then just a fact of like drinking every single day, you know kind of thing and

1834
01:56:45.02 --> 01:56:49.74
The more you do you know how you the more you get in the routine it on some with something the harder

1835
01:56:50.14 --> 01:56:55.82
The harder it is to just straight up break that routine especially when it provides the payoff is like drinking does chemically

1836
01:56:55.82 --> 01:56:58.46
I mean you're like when you drink it the instantaneously yeah

1837
01:56:58.46 --> 01:57:04.78
Exactly right along to a payoff no long-term pay off negative like not even proportionately

1838
01:57:05.66 --> 01:57:09.82
More beneficial to to to to stop drinking like you know when he said

1839
01:57:11.34 --> 01:57:13.66
Wow, this is how everyday people walk around

1840
01:57:13.66 --> 01:57:16.94
Yeah, yeah, that's really and really and I felt that

1841
01:57:16.94 --> 01:57:22.46
Statement great that's so true. That's exactly what I thought I'm saying no one did trick in these feet

1842
01:57:22.46 --> 01:57:26.94
Chocolate doesn't drink right so no one did chocolate's doing all this stuff. I could I could do all that stuff

1843
01:57:26.94 --> 01:57:29.26
That's how you feel I'm not saying I'm doing all this stuff

1844
01:57:29.50 --> 01:57:32.94
I'm just saying that's the feeling so I could I could dig it anyway

1845
01:57:33.98 --> 01:57:36.62
Point is when you're on this path it's not always easy

1846
01:57:38.54 --> 01:57:44.78
But psychological warfare is there to get you through those difficult parts parts that you admit

1847
01:57:45.50 --> 01:57:49.98
Or that you can admit that you need maybe a little little push little help little spot

1848
01:57:49.98 --> 01:57:53.58
We can up early procrastinating that's a big one

1849
01:57:55.34 --> 01:58:00.70
Skipping the workout that kind of stuff psychological warfare, okay, so there's a track for every little weakness you might encounter

1850
01:58:01.26 --> 01:58:04.30
Skipping the diet or or or slacking on the diet. That's a good one

1851
01:58:05.18 --> 01:58:11.50
But yeah check that one out and you know see what up could we just support yourself in your on the path when you're on the path and

1852
01:58:11.50 --> 01:58:21.42
What the podcast as well also you can get some jocco white tea which tastes like victory and we'll make you feel really good

1853
01:58:21.98 --> 01:58:27.98
You get that on Amazon the books way the warrior kid number one which we just covered obviously

1854
01:58:28.62 --> 01:58:34.70
It is not just a book for kids. Yeah Uncle Jake has something to teach all of us myself included

1855
01:58:34.94 --> 01:58:37.50
It's for adults and teenagers and anyone else that wants to

1856
01:58:37.50 --> 01:58:44.62
Have a better life can I add something about where the work you yeah, which and I I'm on a cycle

1857
01:58:44.62 --> 01:58:47.90
I just read it over and over again like I just like a routine

1858
01:58:48.22 --> 01:58:51.58
Your child or yeah, she's for an asshole. She can't quite read yet

1859
01:58:53.10 --> 01:58:55.90
But there's little things in there that it's like

1860
01:58:56.46 --> 01:59:01.82
This is really good that these kids are getting this this message because it's stuff that as an adult you're like dang

1861
01:59:01.82 --> 01:59:05.18
I never really even though you know it like okay, and this is what it is

1862
01:59:05.18 --> 01:59:08.78
When you're like how do you expect to be good at something if you don't practice

1863
01:59:10.06 --> 01:59:16.02
Like little kids don't know that they don't they straight up don't yeah and you got it practice

1864
01:59:16.02 --> 01:59:20.54
I feel like we kind of forget that no way no, we absolutely do yeah

1865
01:59:21.10 --> 01:59:28.46
So yeah, it's for sure there's a lot in that book and and sometimes I read that book and I and there's even more in there

1866
01:59:28.54 --> 01:59:34.06
Then I even recognized you know it in because I the lessons that are coming out of my head

1867
01:59:34.06 --> 01:59:39.90
They're so important they're like beyond my own comprehension. Yeah, and I was just explaining the book way the warrior kid two

1868
01:59:39.90 --> 01:59:45.98
Which is gonna come out and I was I was just talking through a with a guy yesterday like what what it's about

1869
01:59:46.54 --> 01:59:49.18
And as I'm explaining everything that it's about

1870
01:59:49.66 --> 01:59:53.26
It's a lot of stuff and it's a lot of really important lessons

1871
01:59:54.38 --> 01:59:59.34
But yeah, it starts with way the warrior kid the second warrior kid book will be out April 28th

1872
01:59:59.66 --> 02:00:01.66
2018

1873
02:00:01.66 --> 02:00:06.46
Actually speaking of books there is extreme ownership a new edition a

1874
02:00:07.18 --> 02:00:12.10
New edition is out. It's not a totally new book. It's a new edition of it. It's gonna be available November 21st

1876
02:00:16.94 --> 02:00:20.46
It's got a new forward in it so so later I wrote a new forward

1877
02:00:21.34 --> 02:00:23.66
It has some color pictures in it

1878
02:00:24.70 --> 02:00:29.66
Also the new cover is black we changed the cover from white to black. Why?

1879
02:00:29.66 --> 02:00:31.66
Because black

1880
02:00:31.66 --> 02:00:39.42
Yes, because it looks cooler. Way cooler also and this is interesting. There's a new Q and A section in the back of the book

1881
02:00:39.50 --> 02:00:42.54
That is actually from this podcast

1882
02:00:43.34 --> 02:00:51.14
So I kind of rounded up the most prominent leadership questions that that that we've answered on this podcast and wrote them up and kind of ed

1883
02:00:51.14 --> 02:00:56.66
How to edit them a little bit to make sure that they made sense without without everything we talked about today without the tone and

1884
02:00:56.66 --> 02:01:00.10
And the the pacing of what's being said

1885
02:01:00.74 --> 02:01:03.62
excited edit them a little bit but that they're there

1886
02:01:04.26 --> 02:01:08.58
What the answers were given on this podcast and they're all from everyone's questions

1887
02:01:09.06 --> 02:01:11.06

1888
02:01:11.06 --> 02:01:18.46

Fauts and actions they're both in there. It's been great again getting great feedback. I appreciate everyone's feedback

1896
02:01:53.18 --> 02:02:01.98
It's pretty straightforward book no fluff involved not not making you read a bunch of

1897
02:02:04.62 --> 02:02:08.22
Words to get to my point here's my point

1898
02:02:09.58 --> 02:02:13.82
You can get it anywhere that they that they sell books including

1899
02:02:15.58 --> 02:02:22.06
Obviously Amazon Barnes and nobody you can get it at Walmart by the way target the publisher ship that out to everywhere

1900
02:02:22.06 --> 02:02:28.46
So you can pick it up. It's a good book to give to people in my opinion

1901
02:02:28.70 --> 02:02:33.78
It's it's it's not just like giving someone a book you're giving them something a little bit more than a book

1902
02:02:35.06 --> 02:02:40.08
Yeah, it's like something a little bit more than a book. It's I don't know if I can't I can't explain it too well right now

1903
02:02:40.58 --> 02:02:46.14
Look at it. Yeah, you can look at it. It's it's not normal. I would say it's not normal

1904
02:02:46.14 --> 02:02:51.82

Echoes at echel Charles and I am at jockelwillink and

1921
02:04:14.86 --> 02:04:21.90
To close out. I want to say thanks to our military that's out there on the front lines. I recently got reports of ISIS in Iraq

1922
02:04:23.34 --> 02:04:25.34
sending kids to

1923
02:04:25.74 --> 02:04:29.82
To surrender to coalition forces, but they've been laden with suicide

1924
02:04:30.38 --> 02:04:36.70
bombs and rigged to blow up and as these kids would approach the areas

1925
02:04:36.70 --> 02:04:38.70
set aside for surrender

1926
02:04:39.02 --> 02:04:45.98
to American forces they would the Americans would see the terror in their eyes and realize that there was something wrong and American

1927
02:04:46.54 --> 02:04:48.54
military men

1928
02:04:49.18 --> 02:04:53.26
Especially explosive ordinance disposal technicians would risk their lives

1929
02:04:54.78 --> 02:04:57.82
time and time again to go disarm these bombs

1930
02:04:59.02 --> 02:05:03.02
risking their lives so that these young children can live

1931
02:05:03.02 --> 02:05:07.66
who who even does that

1932
02:05:09.74 --> 02:05:13.26
I'll tell you who America's service men and women

1933
02:05:14.86 --> 02:05:23.02
They are the finest and we thank them for their service and sacrifice and to police and law enforcement

1934
02:05:23.02 --> 02:05:26.46
firefighters, paramedics, other first responders

1935
02:05:26.46 --> 02:05:32.30
Thank you for doing your job extremely difficult

1936
02:05:33.82 --> 02:05:35.82
Often thankless

1937
02:05:35.82 --> 02:05:41.26
Keeping us safe here on the home front and to everyone else that is listening

1938
02:05:43.82 --> 02:05:49.34
Remember this if there's something in your life that you want to change then change it

1939
02:05:50.70 --> 02:05:55.74
You have control and if you don't think you have control then take

1940
02:05:55.74 --> 02:05:57.02
control

1941
02:05:58.62 --> 02:06:00.62
Get a grip on your life

1942
02:06:02.94 --> 02:06:05.18
and start getting after it

1943
02:06:05.18 --> 02:06:27.82
So until next time this is echo and jacco out
