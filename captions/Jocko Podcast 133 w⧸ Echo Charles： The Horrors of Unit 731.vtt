00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.06
This is Jockel Podcast number 133 with echo Charles and me jockelwillink

2
00:00:06.90 --> 00:00:08.90
Good evening echo. Good evening

3
00:00:10.72 --> 00:00:12.72
And this podcast

4
00:00:13.68 --> 00:00:15.68
will cover a

5
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:17.76
horrific

6
00:00:17.76 --> 00:00:19.76
subject of history

7
00:00:20.88 --> 00:00:24.96
And it is not for children or the faint of heart

8
00:00:26.24 --> 00:00:27.44
So

9
00:00:27.44 --> 00:00:30.72
Listener discretion is advised

10
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:37.12
I am a war criminal

11
00:00:39.84 --> 00:00:45.12
I served in Manchuko that phony country created by Japan

12
00:00:48.48 --> 00:00:51.12
In 1992 a group of us

13
00:00:51.12 --> 00:00:59.52
Went to China to apologize to the family members of the people we had sent to unit 731

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.48
One woman now about 60 was the grandchild of one of the victims

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.72
She told us our grandfather was killed by unit 731 in experiments

16
00:01:12.72 --> 00:01:20.32
He was killed because they can be tied to the sentence

17
00:01:21.76 --> 00:01:24.32
If you hadn't sent him he would have lived

18
00:01:24.88 --> 00:01:27.60
Your killers just like those doctors

19
00:01:29.84 --> 00:01:38.80
We prostrated ourselves in apology and she kept pressing the fact home that we were partners in crime as guilty as the doctors of unit 731

20
00:01:38.80 --> 00:01:42.80
And it's true

21
00:01:44.80 --> 00:01:46.80
It is just as she said

22
00:01:48.40 --> 00:01:51.76
Apologizing does not erase the crime

23
00:01:54.24 --> 00:01:56.24
We were the aggressors

24
00:01:56.80 --> 00:02:00.32
Most of the Japanese participants in the war were aggressors

25
00:02:02.72 --> 00:02:05.44
Orders came from above orders from the emperor

26
00:02:05.44 --> 00:02:09.60
And people were killed because it couldn't be helped

27
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:17.44
According to international convention those who kill in combat are not criminals

28
00:02:19.60 --> 00:02:26.32
The 3000 people killed by unit 731 were all sent there by the Kenpatae or the police

29
00:02:26.32 --> 00:02:36.08
The American Navy was attacked at Pearl Harbor and the Japanese thought it was a victorious strike

30
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:42.40
Yet within two years America had built up its naval strength again

31
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:46.32
America is a machine society

32
00:02:48.72 --> 00:02:52.40
But bacteriological warfare does not rely on machines

33
00:02:52.40 --> 00:03:00.16
So, he's idea was to kill the attacking Russians with disease

34
00:03:02.88 --> 00:03:06.64
Once killed troops are not rebuilt like machinery

35
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:14.80
The Japanese army promised Chinese children money for bringing in rats

36
00:03:14.80 --> 00:03:24.40
The later gave them a pencil for every rat the end purpose of all this effort was war

37
00:03:26.80 --> 00:03:29.36
In war the side who kills more people wins

38
00:03:31.52 --> 00:03:34.16
bacteria can kill on a large scale

39
00:03:34.16 --> 00:03:45.60
So, he's he pressed this forward

40
00:03:45.60 --> 00:03:50.96
And that is testimony from a Kentypai officer

41
00:03:50.96 --> 00:03:54.64
Which was kind of like a secret police that served in Japan

42
00:03:55.60 --> 00:03:58.32
Leading up to and during the World War II

43
00:03:58.32 --> 00:04:05.12
And this is a part of history that

44
00:04:07.52 --> 00:04:10.08
I don't really want to talk about no one does

45
00:04:11.84 --> 00:04:13.44
But of course to ignore it

46
00:04:15.68 --> 00:04:21.76
To think that if we pretend it didn't happen that only opens up the door for it to happen again

47
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:30.88
So, this is the story of unit 731 and arm of the Japanese Imperial Army

48
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.40
That along with some other associated units they developed tested

49
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:41.60
And employed chemical and biological warfare weapons

50
00:04:43.52 --> 00:04:47.92
And there's two books that I reviewed and will be referring to

51
00:04:47.92 --> 00:04:54.16
During this podcast one is unit 731

52
00:04:55.60 --> 00:05:01.04
By Pete Williams and David Wallace and the other is unit 731 testimony

53
00:05:02.64 --> 00:05:06.64
By how gold and

54
00:05:08.80 --> 00:05:13.76
The history and the acts that are counted for in these books

55
00:05:13.76 --> 00:05:18.40
Really show what man is capable of

56
00:05:20.96 --> 00:05:23.68
Especially on a malevolent leadership

57
00:05:25.60 --> 00:05:26.40
And in this case

58
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.28
The leader that is primarily culpable for the crimes of unit 731 is the individual referred to in that opening statement

59
00:05:37.28 --> 00:05:44.40
The guy named by the name of E.C. Shiro E.C.

60
00:05:44.72 --> 00:05:51.68
June 25th 1892 the fourth son in a wealthy land owning family he was

61
00:05:52.96 --> 00:06:00.64
Smart apparently very smart individual he was a big tall kind of strapping guy then in

62
00:06:00.64 --> 00:06:06.56
By most accounts he was a pretty arrogant individual as well

63
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.20
Anyone to school to become a doctor and join the army and

64
00:06:13.36 --> 00:06:15.36
their he studied

65
00:06:16.80 --> 00:06:18.80
Bacteriology and

66
00:06:19.28 --> 00:06:27.36
Serology which is the the study of blood and pathogens in the blood and he was also a fiercely patriotic and nationalistic

67
00:06:27.36 --> 00:06:32.16
Individual and what that men in Japan at this time

68
00:06:33.44 --> 00:06:36.72
Was a feeling of total superiority

69
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.04
Both a cultural superiority and a racial superiority

70
00:06:43.52 --> 00:06:45.52
Cultural and racial superiority

71
00:06:45.92 --> 00:06:49.68
Superiority over the rest of Asia and really over the rest of the world

72
00:06:51.92 --> 00:06:54.24
And he moved up through the ranks

73
00:06:54.24 --> 00:07:01.68
Fairly quickly and he had done some traveling and of course saw things that happened in World War I

74
00:07:02.72 --> 00:07:08.000
And he saw chemical and biological warfare as a way to win wars and obviously Japan as a

75
00:07:08.64 --> 00:07:13.68
Ironation with limited resources and so you need some advantage

76
00:07:14.48 --> 00:07:16.40
And he thought the advantage that

77
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:19.76
Japan could get was chemical and biological warfare

78
00:07:19.76 --> 00:07:26.96
And in order to really maximize that advantage

79
00:07:28.16 --> 00:07:30.16
He believed

80
00:07:30.80 --> 00:07:34.80
That these weapons needed to be tested

81
00:07:36.08 --> 00:07:38.08
on people

82
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:41.28
He believed that human experimentation

83
00:07:41.28 --> 00:07:49.36
was the pathway to move ahead of the rest of the world technologically in these departments

84
00:07:51.12 --> 00:07:53.60
And oddly enough he

85
00:07:55.20 --> 00:07:58.88
Gained a decent amount of clouds and prestige by

86
00:08:00.08 --> 00:08:02.40
Inventing a water filtration system

87
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:09.52
That could provide clean water to soldiers on the front line which was a really big deal and and the book

88
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:11.04
The book

89
00:08:11.04 --> 00:08:19.04
Testimon of the unit 731 Testimon he goes into pretty good detail about the number of people that were killed in in wars back then and how many of them would die of

90
00:08:19.12 --> 00:08:26.56
Diseases and and malnutrition from being sick from the water having disease and whatnot and so he developed this

91
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:30.000
This filtration system that worked really well

92
00:08:31.60 --> 00:08:33.60
And he ended up actually

93
00:08:33.60 --> 00:08:41.76
Taking advantage of that a little too much and he used that technology which he'd come up with to get some kickback payments from a commercial company

94
00:08:41.76 --> 00:08:48.56
That manufactured the filters and that kind of got him in some trouble, but that trouble was overcome because he had some political connections that he had gained and

95
00:08:50.56 --> 00:08:55.52
He's gotten a go back on path and continue to gain rank and gain stature

96
00:08:57.12 --> 00:09:02.48
And with that rank and that stature that he gained he convinced his leadership

97
00:09:02.48 --> 00:09:05.20
To allow him to begin a

98
00:09:06.32 --> 00:09:09.84
Highly secret program where he would make and

99
00:09:11.20 --> 00:09:15.60
Test the biological and chemical weapons and

100
00:09:17.76 --> 00:09:21.12
Again at this time chemical and biological weapons were very

101
00:09:22.32 --> 00:09:23.68
Politically sensitive

102
00:09:23.68 --> 00:09:31.28
So this is in the mid 1930s the end of world war one had had only occurred just prior to this really

103
00:09:31.28 --> 00:09:33.28
20 years and

104
00:09:36.48 --> 00:09:45.20
People remembered those those wars that war and they remembered the horrors of those weapons and and that's why international law had

105
00:09:46.16 --> 00:09:48.16
for bitton these weapons

106
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But he she didn't care

107
00:09:53.04 --> 00:09:57.84
He she was there to win at any cost and

108
00:09:57.84 --> 00:09:59.84
And

109
00:10:01.20 --> 00:10:07.28
Because of the view of the chemical and biological weapons at this time in the political sensitivity around them

110
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:10.48
He couldn't do what he wanted to do inside of Japan

111
00:10:12.08 --> 00:10:18.40
Because these weapons are dangerous first of all, but again the political sensitivity around them that was okay because he had other plans

112
00:10:19.92 --> 00:10:22.80
And he opened his first laboratory in

113
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:29.44
Manchuria an area of China that was at this time under the brutal control of Imperial Japan

114
00:10:31.28 --> 00:10:38.40
And the first laboratory that he put together was outside of a city called harbin and

115
00:10:40.96 --> 00:10:44.96
Interestingly the unit maintained a level of cover

116
00:10:44.96 --> 00:10:55.52
Meaning their their purpose wasn't made known to the world that people they advertised the unit that they put in Manchuria

117
00:10:56.08 --> 00:11:02.72
That it was all about water purification and they and they actually did water purification there so it was a good cover story

118
00:11:04.56 --> 00:11:11.68
But what was really being focused on underneath that cover was the creation of biological and chemical weapons

119
00:11:11.68 --> 00:11:17.44
That they could use for war and as E.C

120
00:11:19.76 --> 00:11:21.76
Made progression

121
00:11:22.40 --> 00:11:24.40
The project

122
00:11:24.40 --> 00:11:31.68
Expanded and now I'm going to go to the book unit 731 by Peter Williams and David Wallace

123
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:37.68
Here we go and a few short years

124
00:11:37.68 --> 00:11:44.000
E.C's project had hurled from relative obscurity to one of top secret and national importance

125
00:11:44.08 --> 00:11:46.64
It took two years to construct the establishments

126
00:11:47.36 --> 00:11:52.56
150 or so buildings which included accommodation for thousands of people a railway siding an

127
00:11:53.20 --> 00:12:00.40
Insinerator in powerhouse with tall cooling towers an animal house and airfield a large administration building an

128
00:12:00.80 --> 00:12:04.68
Exercise yard and a strange for bidding square shaped building known as

129
00:12:04.68 --> 00:12:06.68
Roll Block

130
00:12:06.92 --> 00:12:08.92
R.O

131
00:12:08.92 --> 00:12:17.40
The Japanese character, Roll is square in shape hence the name of the building although roll block looked square from the outside

132
00:12:18.68 --> 00:12:24.52
Hidden from view in the center where two other buildings known as blocks seven and eight

133
00:12:26.36 --> 00:12:31.80
Roll block was the center of bacteria production and disease research block seven and eight

134
00:12:31.80 --> 00:12:33.80
Had a more sinister purpose

135
00:12:36.44 --> 00:12:45.000
Unit 731's bacterial logical research division was divided into more than a dozen squads each investigating the warfare

136
00:12:45.16 --> 00:12:51.24
Possibility of a wide variety of diseases plague and thorax disentery typhoid paratide foid

137
00:12:51.24 --> 00:12:55.56
cholera and many other exotic and unknown diseases were studied

138
00:12:55.56 --> 00:13:02.92
Every conceivable facility was given to unit 731 so I think that's important because

139
00:13:03.96 --> 00:13:05.32
They

140
00:13:05.32 --> 00:13:10.44
They were getting a lot of money this wasn't like a little rogue project that wasn't being supported

141
00:13:11.40 --> 00:13:13.40
As a matter of fact

142
00:13:13.40 --> 00:13:19.96
Here so two were luxuries lavished on the lifestyle of e-she's researchers and workers in the remote

143
00:13:19.96 --> 00:13:26.52
Manchering plane at ping fan a whole biological township grew up. It was known as

144
00:13:26.84 --> 00:13:28.84
Togo village

145
00:13:28.84 --> 00:13:34.92
So around this unit 731 there's a whole village that got created and they were all living the good life by the way

146
00:13:34.92 --> 00:13:42.76
Walter Pan is not living rest of Japan is you know out getting ready to go to war or at war in various parts of the world and living lean

147
00:13:43.64 --> 00:13:45.64
The here they're living large

148
00:13:45.64 --> 00:13:51.72
Back to the book Togo villagers had plentiful supplies of the best foods at times when people in Tokyo were starving

149
00:13:52.36 --> 00:13:57.64
Ping fan was essentially heated against the bitter sub-zero temperatures of the Manchering winter

150
00:13:58.44 --> 00:14:04.28
Naturally it had the best sanitation including even western style style laboratories

151
00:14:06.04 --> 00:14:08.04
So he took care of his people and

152
00:14:08.68 --> 00:14:11.16
His people and he were getting taken care of

153
00:14:11.16 --> 00:14:16.60
Building a bacterial weapon E.C. found out was not an easy task

154
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:22.44
He and his researchers faced a myriad of problems what kind of microorganisms would make a

155
00:14:22.92 --> 00:14:25.40
Effective biological warfare agent

156
00:14:26.60 --> 00:14:35.000
Should it have a lethal or incapacitating effect could it be produced in quantity sufficient for wartime employment could these living organisms be kept kept alive

157
00:14:35.32 --> 00:14:38.84
Through storage and shipment to their ultimate employment on the battlefield

158
00:14:38.84 --> 00:14:42.44
What type of munition would be needed to deliver the agent to the target?

159
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.60
What were the technical and military characteristics of such a weapon?

160
00:14:46.92 --> 00:14:48.92
So he started from ground zero

161
00:14:49.64 --> 00:14:51.64
Trying to figure all this out

162
00:14:52.36 --> 00:14:59.40
Issue approached the problem by looking for weapons that could be delivered from altitude by aircraft causing massive outbreaks of epidemics

163
00:15:01.16 --> 00:15:03.80
Ever since his trip to Europe play get fascinating

164
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:10.12
And I talked about his travel and this is they're talking a little bit about that here he knew would make a deadly weapon if it could be

165
00:15:10.12 --> 00:15:15.72
Harnessed it is highly infectious with an incubation period of three to four days sometimes up to a week

166
00:15:16.36 --> 00:15:18.36
The onset is abrupt with chills

167
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.68
High fever and extreme weakness the eyes redden the face becomes congested and the tongue coded

168
00:15:25.40 --> 00:15:26.84
Victims can become

169
00:15:26.84 --> 00:15:31.000
Moniically delirious and death may be rapid sometimes within one day

170
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.48
Compared with some bacterial pathogens plague is only moderately infectious

171
00:15:37.72 --> 00:15:40.36
But more virulent strains can be cultivated

172
00:15:42.04 --> 00:15:48.04
Plague could create casualties often out of all proportion to the number of bacteria disseminated

173
00:15:49.40 --> 00:15:57.40
Issue deduced therefore that it would make an efficient weapon and set about preparing the most dangerous strains and it's some point on this podcast

174
00:15:57.40 --> 00:15:59.40
We'll talk about the black plague

175
00:15:59.40 --> 00:16:01.40
Which is

176
00:16:01.80 --> 00:16:04.20
Unepidemic that was insane in Europe

177
00:16:05.40 --> 00:16:12.44
But when you when you when you have any knowledge about the black plague and you read about someone that's looking at it

178
00:16:12.44 --> 00:16:14.44
San he this looks like a good idea

179
00:16:14.44 --> 00:16:18.20
You realize that this is just a sick sadistic person

180
00:16:19.88 --> 00:16:21.88
Plague had another advantage for eshi

181
00:16:22.92 --> 00:16:24.92
Its origins could be concealed

182
00:16:24.92 --> 00:16:33.48
Science had not then provided a satisfactory answer to the age old question of why where for how long and how badly

183
00:16:33.48 --> 00:16:38.12
A plague epidemic broke out so he he just thought this is great. We can cover it up

184
00:16:38.84 --> 00:16:42.04
The plague hits our enemy and we you know we don't know where it came from

185
00:16:47.24 --> 00:16:53.24
So they are producing this they begin to produce this so large was the production plant that in the heyday of unit

186
00:16:53.24 --> 00:17:00.28
731 and had the potential for creating sufficient bacteria to kill the world's population several times over

187
00:17:02.68 --> 00:17:05.80
Now that eshi could produce plague and other virulent bacteria

188
00:17:06.36 --> 00:17:13.88
Insufficient quantities for warfare his next task was to discover how he could deliver his deadly microbes to the enemy and

189
00:17:14.60 --> 00:17:15.96
Obviously I'm

190
00:17:15.96 --> 00:17:22.76
Not reading this entire book and and there's more detail about the process of getting to breed these back here

191
00:17:25.16 --> 00:17:27.16
Once they figured out how to breed it

192
00:17:27.96 --> 00:17:31.40
And now we got to figure out how to deliver it how are we gonna attack the enemy with this?

193
00:17:33.08 --> 00:17:39.32
He tries all kinds of different things and then finally back to the book his eye had come to rest upon the humble

194
00:17:39.96 --> 00:17:41.48
flee

195
00:17:41.48 --> 00:17:47.64
As in nature so to and war this my new insect could be relied upon as the carrier of pestilence

196
00:17:49.40 --> 00:17:56.76
To yield vast quantities of flees and feed them enormous numbers of rats had to be caught and bred

197
00:17:58.20 --> 00:18:04.28
This was the job of unit 731's animal house run by eshi's elder brother Mitsuil

198
00:18:04.28 --> 00:18:15.08
There's like a as I was reading this there's like this whole image of I mean are there you just think about the

199
00:18:16.12 --> 00:18:19.56
The reputation of rats and flees

200
00:18:20.12 --> 00:18:22.12
Right rats and flees are just

201
00:18:22.68 --> 00:18:29.72
The worst right and and it just paints this picture you just see rats and flees and this is what they're breeding

202
00:18:29.72 --> 00:18:34.20
Yeah, this could this is like a horror movie yeah

203
00:18:37.16 --> 00:18:44.84
At back to the book at times of peak production members of e-she's force were required to dress in civilian clothes and go rat catching

204
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.72
He found a method suitable for weapons use

205
00:18:52.28 --> 00:18:58.28
Here's a description of the flee factory the second division had four special premises for the mass breeding of flees

206
00:18:58.28 --> 00:19:03.08
In which a mixed temperature a fixed temperature of 30 degrees Celsius was maintained

207
00:19:03.48 --> 00:19:08.76
Metal jars 30 centimeters high and 50 centimeters wide were used for the bleet breeding of flees

208
00:19:09.32 --> 00:19:18.76
Rice husks were poured into the jars to keep the flees in after these preparations a few flees were put into each jar and also a white rat for them to feed on

209
00:19:18.76 --> 00:19:30.36
The rat was fastened in such a way as to not hurt the flees it's a horror movie

210
00:19:31.56 --> 00:19:33.56
but

211
00:19:34.12 --> 00:19:36.76
So they're they're going through this process of

212
00:19:37.48 --> 00:19:43.64
Breeding flees breeding rats using the rats to feed the flees and and raise the flees so they can put these flees into containers

213
00:19:43.64 --> 00:19:50.12
They're trying out all different kind of containers and how to drop them and how to spread them and as they're figuring all that out

214
00:19:51.32 --> 00:19:55.000
They're doing other things as well and it wasn't just rats and flees

215
00:19:56.20 --> 00:20:03.80
They're at unit 731 back to the book hidden from the outside world at the center of unit 731's roll block was

216
00:20:03.80 --> 00:20:05.80
E-she's secret of secrets

217
00:20:06.68 --> 00:20:13.24
So carefully was its existence kept secret that many junior members of unit 731 had no knowledge that it was there

218
00:20:13.24 --> 00:20:15.24
at all

219
00:20:15.24 --> 00:20:19.96
For prisoners to pass through the tunnel entrance was to start a journey of no return

220
00:20:21.64 --> 00:20:23.64
Only two things were certain

221
00:20:24.92 --> 00:20:26.92
Agony and death

222
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.76
Three of the E-she brothers and including Takeo

223
00:20:33.48 --> 00:20:35.88
Mitsuo and of course the youngest Shiro

224
00:20:35.88 --> 00:20:44.52
Worked at Pingfain Takeo was the prison commander the prisons guards were second or third sons from the E-she brothers village

225
00:20:44.92 --> 00:20:46.92
cameo

226
00:20:48.12 --> 00:20:54.76
They were called the special squad tied by bonds of peasant loyalty to their lord and master they worshiped him

227
00:20:55.88 --> 00:21:00.84
They called him the honorable E-she or sometimes in reverence war god E-she

228
00:21:00.84 --> 00:21:05.64
Most were uneducated but all were unstorvingly loyal

229
00:21:06.68 --> 00:21:14.28
To ensure allegiance E-she paid them extra allowances for their terrible and dangerous duties the sort of money sent home for which

230
00:21:14.52 --> 00:21:20.04
Would support whole families through difficult times to come even pay for their brothers and sisters educations

231
00:21:22.44 --> 00:21:29.48
No cameo villager has ever publicly spoken even today about their former life in manchuria the village is silent

232
00:21:29.48 --> 00:21:36.12
The E-she family name is still revered for its kindness asked about unit 731 older residents were

233
00:21:36.68 --> 00:21:42.32
Presence of we reply I have nothing to say because it concerns the secrets of the honorable Shiro

234
00:21:42.32 --> 00:21:44.32
E-she

235
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:51.20
E-she based his unit in remote northern manchuria so he could experiment on human beings

236
00:21:51.20 --> 00:21:58.32
Therein what was a police state he could be given an uninterrupted supply of human guinea pigs

237
00:21:59.60 --> 00:22:07.12
With a unique data gained from the human experiments E-she believed Japan could outstrip the rest of the world and developing this new weapon of war

238
00:22:08.40 --> 00:22:15.36
No other country would have such accurate details about how ec epidemic spread or how to forget protect against them

239
00:22:15.36 --> 00:22:22.56
Only Japan would fully master the twin fields of biological warfare offense and defense

240
00:22:25.60 --> 00:22:30.24
From the earliest days E-she appears to have employed human guinea pigs

241
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.32
It was performed on prisoners who were sentenced to death at Harbin prison

242
00:22:37.76 --> 00:22:42.56
Each prisoner was placed in a closely guarded cell while the experiments took place

243
00:22:42.56 --> 00:22:48.48
After death the bodies were burned in an electric furnace to leave no trace

244
00:22:50.96 --> 00:22:57.52
By 1935 motion pictures of human experiments were customarily being shown to senior staff officers

245
00:23:00.40 --> 00:23:09.28
Occupied Manchuria and Harbin in particular was an ideal location for supply of human fodder and I should say that so it started off

246
00:23:09.28 --> 00:23:14.32
They would use prisoners that were sentenced to death. That's that's where it started

247
00:23:14.40 --> 00:23:19.12
But the supply wasn't enough and it escalated from there just to just to normal people

248
00:23:20.80 --> 00:23:29.20
And here's where it talks about that a little bit back to the book occupied Manchuria and Harbin in particular was an ideal location for supply of human fodder

249
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:35.04
Harbin a multi-racial city of shifting minority groups was a nest of spies

250
00:23:35.04 --> 00:23:42.64
In addition Japan's occupation had brought forth strong resistance from both Chinese nationalist and Chinese communists

251
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:46.48
as well as indigenous mancharians and Mongolians

252
00:23:47.52 --> 00:23:54.08
There was also a large white Russian population caught in the middle between communist Russia and expansionist Japan

253
00:23:55.60 --> 00:24:02.56
To maintain control in these difficult circumstances was the job of this Japanese secret service agency

254
00:24:02.56 --> 00:24:06.72
Called the Tokomu Kikan and the Kenpitai

255
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:11.44
They did so through brutal tactics of fear

256
00:24:12.08 --> 00:24:19.84
Anyone who voiced opposition to the self-decare declared a paradise of Manchuko was liable to detention

257
00:24:20.80 --> 00:24:22.80
Many never returned

258
00:24:22.80 --> 00:24:29.20
The Japanese secret service guide to the fundamental rules for interrogating war prisoners

259
00:24:29.20 --> 00:24:37.76
Reveals that world so this is a document which I'm going to read a couple parts of of how you torture people

260
00:24:38.80 --> 00:24:40.80
They're their process for torturing people

261
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:44.72
Number 62

262
00:24:44.72 --> 00:24:50.000
Sometimes depending on circumstances it is advantageous to resort to church torture

263
00:24:51.52 --> 00:24:55.76
Torture the inflection number 63 torture the inflection of physical suffering

264
00:24:55.76 --> 00:25:03.60
Must be sustained and continued in such a way that there should be no other way of relief from suffering except by giving truthful information

265
00:25:04.96 --> 00:25:11.44
Tortures advantageous because of the speed with which it is possible with relative ease to compel persons of weak will

266
00:25:11.84 --> 00:25:13.84
To give truthful testimony

267
00:25:13.84 --> 00:25:23.68
But there is danger that in order to relieve himself from suffering or in order to please the interrogator the person interrogated will on the contrary distort the truth

268
00:25:23.68 --> 00:25:34.88
In the case of a persons of strong will torture may strengthen their will to resist and leave ill-feeling against the empire after the interrogation

269
00:25:37.28 --> 00:25:44.08
In relation to persons of weak will torture is usually applied in those cases when the person interrogated does not speak the truth

270
00:25:44.08 --> 00:25:46.08
Even in the face of evidence

271
00:25:46.08 --> 00:25:51.04
But there is full reason to suppose that this person will speak frankly if torture is applied

272
00:25:51.04 --> 00:26:03.04
It is necessary to bear in mind that the methods of torture must be such as can easily be applied as will sustained suffering without

273
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:05.44
Rousing feelings of pity

274
00:26:06.96 --> 00:26:11.52
And as will not leave either wounds or scars. So let's think about that right there

275
00:26:12.08 --> 00:26:15.76
What they're saying is that the torture has to be so easy to apply

276
00:26:15.76 --> 00:26:19.92
That the person that's doing the torture won't feel sorry for

277
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:28.80
However in cases where it's necessary to create the apprehension of death the harm caused the person

278
00:26:28.80 --> 00:26:36.96
Interrogated can be ignored but this must be done in such a way as to not make it possible to continue not make it impossible to continue the interrogation

279
00:26:38.56 --> 00:26:44.56
After the application of torture is necessary to convince the person who is undergone the torture that the torture applied to him was

280
00:26:44.56 --> 00:26:51.36
Quite a natural measure or to take such measures as will induce him out of his sense of pride sense of honor

281
00:26:51.36 --> 00:26:52.16
etc

282
00:26:52.16 --> 00:26:54.16
Not to speak about it afterwards

283
00:26:54.48 --> 00:26:56.88
So that's when you say hey look we torture you you broke and

284
00:26:57.52 --> 00:27:00.000
Your weak and you should be embarrassed about it

285
00:27:02.72 --> 00:27:04.16
Number 69

286
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:08.80
Nobody must know about this application of torture except the person's concerned with this

287
00:27:09.60 --> 00:27:12.56
Under no circumstances must other prisoners know about it

288
00:27:12.56 --> 00:27:16.64
It is very important to take measures to prevent shrieks from being heard

289
00:27:20.80 --> 00:27:25.20
So they had their methodology they had their standard operating procedures

290
00:27:26.64 --> 00:27:31.76
To be a spy or dissident in Manchuria was to risk death by firing squad or decapitation

291
00:27:32.88 --> 00:27:34.88
But there was an alternative far worse

292
00:27:36.16 --> 00:27:39.04
Death at the hands of unit 731

293
00:27:39.04 --> 00:27:46.64
Unsuspecting an innocent people were also tricked into the clutches of unit 731

294
00:27:47.04 --> 00:27:53.44
somewhere lowered by the prospect of employment young boys mothers and children even pregnant women

295
00:27:54.72 --> 00:27:56.72
were trapped

296
00:27:59.04 --> 00:28:01.04
Here's a

297
00:28:01.28 --> 00:28:03.28
A medical orderly

298
00:28:03.28 --> 00:28:10.08
named Isubashi who carried out checkups on and there's a word here Marutus

299
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:15.84
And you're gonna hear what Marutus this what they describe the people that are being held the prisoners inside of

300
00:28:16.40 --> 00:28:20.64
Unit 731 they called them Marutus or Maruta singular

301
00:28:23.04 --> 00:28:31.12
And here's what they orderly had to say about it. I started to work for unit 731 at age of 18 in the special section

302
00:28:31.12 --> 00:28:39.04
Which did the press the checkups on new prisoners we took details of their blood type it's pulse and pressure and other things

303
00:28:40.48 --> 00:28:47.68
Prisoners were all referred to as Maruta which is the Japanese word for a log of wood

304
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:55.52
Although when they arrived they had cards each with their name birthplace reason for arrest and age

305
00:28:55.52 --> 00:28:57.52
We simply gave them a number

306
00:28:57.52 --> 00:29:03.28
Maruta was just a number a piece of experimental material

307
00:29:05.28 --> 00:29:07.28
They were not even regarded as human beings

308
00:29:08.96 --> 00:29:14.80
Most were between 20 and 40 years old none were over 50 they seemed to know their fate

309
00:29:17.60 --> 00:29:19.60
We did terrible things

310
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:28.64
So you can see some obvious dehumanization they don't call them people they call them logs

311
00:29:29.52 --> 00:29:31.52
They give them a number not a name

312
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:36.48
Very standard practice for dehumanization

313
00:29:38.16 --> 00:29:40.56
Back to the book the prison was a vision of hell

314
00:29:40.56 --> 00:29:49.04
Through the spyhole cut in the steel doors of each cell the plight of the chain Marutus could be seen

315
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:55.52
Some had rotting limbs bits of bone protruding through the skin blackened by necrosis

316
00:29:56.48 --> 00:29:58.32
Others were sweating in high fever

317
00:29:58.32 --> 00:30:03.84
Riving in agony or moaning in pain those who suffered from respiratory infectious coughed and

318
00:30:03.84 --> 00:30:10.56
cessantly some were bloated some amaciated and others were blistered or had open wounds

319
00:30:12.16 --> 00:30:14.16
Many of the cells were communal and

320
00:30:15.12 --> 00:30:21.28
Infected person would be put in with healthy marutus to see how easily did the disease is spread

321
00:30:22.80 --> 00:30:29.28
In desperation marutus would try to practice primitive preventive medicine to escape the diseases

322
00:30:29.28 --> 00:30:38.72
Through these little spyholes the most act the most acute symptoms of the worst diseases in the world were coldly observed by

323
00:30:38.72 --> 00:30:41.36
731's white coded doctors

324
00:30:44.96 --> 00:30:50.64
Marutus were used up at the rate of two to three per day

325
00:30:50.64 --> 00:31:01.68
The dichotomy between the doctors true vocation and the need to build a medically based weapon was well

326
00:31:01.68 --> 00:31:09.68
An expediently expressed by an individual probably issue at the initial assembly of unit 731 so this is a quote

327
00:31:10.24 --> 00:31:16.40
Our God-given mission as doctors is to challenge all varieties of the disease causing microorganisms

328
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:24.88
To block all roads of intrusion into the human body to annihilate all foreign matter resident in our bodies and to devise the most

329
00:31:25.60 --> 00:31:27.60
Expeditious treatments possible

330
00:31:29.36 --> 00:31:39.20
However the research upon which we are now about to embark is the complete opposite of these principles and may cause us some anguish as doctors

331
00:31:39.20 --> 00:31:48.88
Nevertheless, I besiege you to pursue this research based on the double medical thrill

332
00:31:50.56 --> 00:31:57.12
One a scientist to exert effort to probing for the truth in the natural science and

333
00:31:58.16 --> 00:32:05.04
Research and into and discovery of the unknown world and two as a military person

334
00:32:05.04 --> 00:32:09.60
To successfully build a powerful military weapon against the enemy

335
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
One young serologist

336
00:32:18.64 --> 00:32:20.64
Dr. Akimoto

337
00:32:20.64 --> 00:32:24.48
sent from the Tokyo Imperial University to Manchuria by his professor

338
00:32:24.56 --> 00:32:30.80
We called the horror of discovering the true purpose of an epidemic prevention and water supply unit

339
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:36.80
And here's what he said I was very shocked when I arrived and found out about the human experiments

340
00:32:38.08 --> 00:32:40.08
Very few of those scientists

341
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:42.72
Scientists had a sense of conscious

342
00:32:44.88 --> 00:32:49.36
They were treated they treated the prisoners like animals the prisoners were the enemy

343
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
They would eventually be sentenced to death

344
00:32:52.40 --> 00:32:58.72
They thought the prisoners would die an honorable death if in the process they contributed to the progress of medical science

345
00:32:58.72 --> 00:33:03.68
I was very frightened although my work involved no human experiments

346
00:33:03.76 --> 00:33:06.40
I wrote my resignation three or four times

347
00:33:07.04 --> 00:33:09.04
But there was no way to get out

348
00:33:09.68 --> 00:33:13.60
I was told that if I left I might secretly be executed

349
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:25.20
So yeah, and I this is covered in pretty good depth in the book. There's like a whole recruiting process to bring the best doctors and scientists from all the

350
00:33:25.20 --> 00:33:32.000
Universities in Japan up to Manchuria to work there so these young kids are becoming doctors think they're going to go out there and save people and

351
00:33:32.32 --> 00:33:34.32
The exact opposite happens

352
00:33:38.16 --> 00:33:40.16
Back to the book

353
00:33:40.16 --> 00:33:42.16
Siffelis was studied

354
00:33:42.16 --> 00:33:48.16
Many female Maruta's died as unit 731 in Devert to solve the venereal disease epidemics

355
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:54.88
Raging through the ranks of Imperial Japanese Army as its military horrors marauded around the Asian

356
00:33:54.88 --> 00:33:56.88
continent

357
00:33:57.84 --> 00:34:03.68
On one occasion a pregnant woman was deliberately infected with the disease and when her child was born

358
00:34:04.72 --> 00:34:06.72
Both were dissected

359
00:34:12.24 --> 00:34:15.92
Crew experiments were not confined confined to the robot

360
00:34:17.36 --> 00:34:20.16
Five hours from ping fan by truck lay

361
00:34:20.16 --> 00:34:31.92
Anta proving ground unit 731's education division trees chief lieutenant coloniti took part in one experiment here are his comments and

362
00:34:32.24 --> 00:34:39.04
Experiment in which I participated was performed in infecting 10 Chinese war prisoners with gas gang green

363
00:34:40.72 --> 00:34:48.24
The object of the experiment was to ascertain whether it was possible to infect people with gas gang green at a temperature of 20 degrees

364
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:50.24
Celsius below zero

365
00:34:52.16 --> 00:34:54.56
This experiment was performed in the following way

366
00:34:55.20 --> 00:35:03.36
10 Chinese war prisoners were tied to stakes at a distance of 10 to 20 meters from a shrapnel bomb that was charged with gas gang green

367
00:35:05.52 --> 00:35:07.84
To prevent the men from being killed outright

368
00:35:08.40 --> 00:35:14.40
Their heads and backs were protected with a special metal shield and thick quilted blankets

369
00:35:14.40 --> 00:35:17.76
But their legs and buttocks were left unprotected

370
00:35:20.16 --> 00:35:31.28
The ball was exploded by means of an electric switch and the shrapnel bearing gas gang green germs scattered all over the spot with the experimentes were bound

371
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.28
All the experimentes were wounded in the legs or buttocks and seven days later

372
00:35:39.28 --> 00:35:46.48
They died in great torment

373
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.60
Miraculously some maruda survived all infection experiments developing remarkable in the unities

374
00:35:59.52 --> 00:36:01.52
But their fate was always the same

375
00:36:02.32 --> 00:36:07.28
Unit 731 had many other uses for human fodder so

376
00:36:07.28 --> 00:36:13.76
They talk about this in the book. I'll some people would develop immunity some guys were just super tough

377
00:36:14.64 --> 00:36:17.04
Just tough and in fact, there's one way to talk about

378
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:23.36
They they finally killed this guy after experiment. He was a 65 year old guy. He was just just tough

379
00:36:24.16 --> 00:36:27.92
He survived all these different infections all these different diseases and they they finally

380
00:36:28.96 --> 00:36:35.68
When they kill him they they open him up they dissect him and they see that he's like got the organs of a 25 year old or something

381
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:40.96
But it didn't matter even if you were resistant to diseases they had other experiments to do

382
00:36:42.88 --> 00:36:48.32
The education chief Nishi had some other recollections about some of those other experiments

383
00:36:51.04 --> 00:36:57.68
Back to the book with temperatures below negative 20 degrees Celsius people were brought out from the detachment's prison into the open

384
00:36:59.28 --> 00:37:04.24
Their arms were buried and made defrees with the help of an artificial current of air

385
00:37:04.24 --> 00:37:09.92
This was done until their frozen arms when struck with a short stick

386
00:37:10.24 --> 00:37:15.20
He made it a sound resembling that which a board gives out when it is struck a

387
00:37:18.32 --> 00:37:21.04
Film was made on this subject too

388
00:37:26.08 --> 00:37:28.08
Here's another

389
00:37:28.64 --> 00:37:31.60
Accounts of these so they were they were trying to figure out

390
00:37:31.60 --> 00:37:37.28
Things about frostbite frostbite and what people could take because they were gonna be fighting up in the

391
00:37:37.84 --> 00:37:39.84
Steps of mentuary and Russia

392
00:37:39.84 --> 00:37:44.40
They thought they'd be fighting there so they had to figure out do experiments to figure out how to

393
00:37:45.28 --> 00:37:48.48
Heal frostbite once it happened and how much cold someone could take

394
00:37:49.92 --> 00:37:53.52
Here's a a printer that worked there and here's a

395
00:37:54.40 --> 00:37:58.24
Account of what he witnessed two naked men were put in an area

396
00:37:58.24 --> 00:38:04.24
40 to 50 degrees below zero and researchers filmed the whole process until they died

397
00:38:07.12 --> 00:38:12.08
They suffered such agony they were digging their nails into each other's flesh

398
00:38:17.36 --> 00:38:22.56
This was military life you couldn't say I want to do this or that in war however good or bad

399
00:38:22.96 --> 00:38:25.76
The Japanese way is to obey a superior

400
00:38:25.76 --> 00:38:30.72
It was the same as if the order came from the emperor

401
00:38:32.56 --> 00:38:36.72
Sometimes they were no anesthetics they screamed in screamed

402
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:41.52
But we didn't regard the logs as human beings

403
00:38:41.52 --> 00:38:52.32
They were lumps of meat on a chopping block

404
00:38:58.16 --> 00:39:00.40
The Japanese way is to obey a superior

405
00:39:03.44 --> 00:39:05.84
I talk about that all the time you got a question

406
00:39:05.84 --> 00:39:09.84
We've got a question

407
00:39:12.88 --> 00:39:14.16
Continuing

408
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:16.80
Detachment 731 had a sister unit

409
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:21.04
It was called the 716 chemical warfare unit

410
00:39:22.40 --> 00:39:26.72
Test were carried out in a large cloud chamber the size of a telephone box

411
00:39:26.72 --> 00:39:33.76
Made of thick steel it had an agitator in the ceiling connected by large pipes to a gas producing machine

412
00:39:36.72 --> 00:39:43.92
Maru does were putting a truck tied to a pole and pushed inside some naked some in full army uniform and some in gas masks

413
00:39:43.92 --> 00:39:53.60
731 and 516 researchers watched them gasping convulsed to their deaths through the chambers reinforced a glass window

414
00:39:57.28 --> 00:40:01.68
A young mother and her baby were even put to death in this chamber

415
00:40:04.32 --> 00:40:09.76
She desperately tried to predict her child from the fumes by covering her it with her body

416
00:40:09.76 --> 00:40:14.96
She died lying on top of her child

417
00:40:23.68 --> 00:40:25.92
Here's another account from a medical

418
00:40:28.08 --> 00:40:37.20
Orderly about other experiments beyond cold and beyond chemical and beyond beyond biological here we get to malnutrition

419
00:40:37.20 --> 00:40:39.20
I saw malnutrition experiments

420
00:40:40.16 --> 00:40:43.36
They were conducted by the project team under the technician

421
00:40:43.92 --> 00:40:45.44
Yoshi Murrah

422
00:40:45.44 --> 00:40:54.88
He was a civilian member of unit 731 the purpose of the experiments I believe was to find out how long a human being could survive with just water and biscuits

423
00:40:56.72 --> 00:41:03.04
Two maru does were used for this experiment. They continuously circled at prescribed course

424
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:08.96
Within the grounds of the unit carrying approximately a 20 kilogram sandbag on their backs

425
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:15.04
Once a come before the other but they both ultimately died

426
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:20.16
The duration of the experiment was about two months

427
00:41:22.56 --> 00:41:29.68
They only received army biscuits to eat and water to drink so that they would not have been able to survive for very long

428
00:41:29.68 --> 00:41:34.64
They weren't allowed a lot of sleep either

429
00:41:39.84 --> 00:41:41.84
And here's

430
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:44.88
One of the major generals

431
00:41:46.24 --> 00:41:48.24
Kawashima

432
00:41:48.24 --> 00:41:56.64
And he talks about the fate of some of the maruutes from 500 to 600 prisoners were consigned to detachment 731 annually

433
00:41:56.64 --> 00:42:07.44
If a prisoner survived the anoculation of lethal bacteria this did not save him from a repetition of the experiments which continued until death from the infection

434
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:10.16
Superveened

435
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:14.88
The infected people were given medical treatment in order to test a various methods of cure

436
00:42:15.28 --> 00:42:18.48
They were fed normally and after they had fully recovered

437
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
We're used for the next experiment

438
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.76
But infected with a different kind of germ at any rate no one ever left this factory alive

439
00:42:32.40 --> 00:42:39.12
Following anatomical study the bodies of the dead were burned in the detachment's incinerator

440
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:47.12
So as I said there's even if you're just

441
00:42:47.12 --> 00:42:52.64
Tough as nails they're just gonna give you a different disease or more disease

442
00:42:58.24 --> 00:43:00.24
And

443
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:02.88
All pretty horrible and now it gets worse

444
00:43:05.76 --> 00:43:11.28
Back to the book perhaps the greatest horror of unit 731 was

445
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:14.56
Viva section

446
00:43:14.56 --> 00:43:19.92
Unit 731 had two teams of pathologists

447
00:43:21.60 --> 00:43:27.76
One headed by doctor akamoto the other by doctor esicawa

448
00:43:30.08 --> 00:43:35.76
Anatomical study performed by these squads was not always confined to the dead

449
00:43:38.24 --> 00:43:40.24
Pathology squad assistant

450
00:43:40.24 --> 00:43:44.88
Kirum zawa saw vivis sections

451
00:43:46.80 --> 00:43:51.60
Unit 731 did work on living human bodies he said

452
00:43:53.52 --> 00:43:57.20
To do this work our sentiments were suppressed

453
00:43:57.20 --> 00:44:09.04
So this is a whole new level we're actually dissecting or vivisecting people that are alive

454
00:44:11.20 --> 00:44:16.08
Back to the book some doctors are said do have come all the way from Japan just to see such a dissection

455
00:44:17.20 --> 00:44:19.20
Laboratory assistants got extra pay

456
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.40
Called the chemical weapons allowance for wielding the scaffold during this dreadful work

457
00:44:24.40 --> 00:44:31.52
Blood is said often to have spurred all over the ceiling of the dissection room as certain

458
00:44:31.52 --> 00:44:39.60
Insisions were made limbs of the dying maruitas would flex and jerk involuntary in voluntarily as the scalpel entered

459
00:44:39.92 --> 00:44:41.92
particular parts of the brain

460
00:44:43.04 --> 00:44:46.64
Organs would twitch vigorously after they were thrown into jars

461
00:44:47.92 --> 00:44:49.92
Of formalin for preservation

462
00:44:49.92 --> 00:44:56.80
Not only were anesthetics researched, but also bizarre surgical experiments

463
00:44:57.36 --> 00:45:01.60
Connecting different parts of the body are reported to have been performed

464
00:45:07.12 --> 00:45:09.12
So

465
00:45:09.36 --> 00:45:12.88
Yeah, this is this is a horror movie that's actually happening you got

466
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:16.40
Sewing different parts of the body together. This is just

467
00:45:16.40 --> 00:45:19.68
a horror movie except this is not a movie and

468
00:45:23.76 --> 00:45:27.12
The

469
00:45:27.12 --> 00:45:30.48
People that are being referred to as maruitas right now are people

470
00:45:34.32 --> 00:45:40.000
Back to the book the world will probably never learn of all the grizzly experiments that took place at unit 731

471
00:45:41.04 --> 00:45:44.80
Among them were pressure experiments similar to those carried out by

472
00:45:44.80 --> 00:45:46.80
Dr. Ratira Dacau

473
00:45:47.68 --> 00:45:49.68
concentration camp

474
00:45:50.32 --> 00:45:55.12
Presumably done on behalf of the Japanese Air Force. It was an extremely painful method of killing

475
00:45:55.68 --> 00:46:05.24
Individual plates in the unit 731 pressure chamber with suffered terrible agony as their eyes first popped out of their sockets as the i membrane

476
00:46:05.24 --> 00:46:15.32
ruptured and later as blood forced its way out through pores in the skin

477
00:46:21.80 --> 00:46:26.36
Maruitas had their blood siphoned often replaced with horse blood and plasma experiments

478
00:46:26.36 --> 00:46:34.92
It was said the number of these poor men women and children who became maruitas were mummified a live and told dehydration experiments

479
00:46:34.92 --> 00:46:38.92
They sweated a death under the heat of hot dry fans

480
00:46:40.92 --> 00:46:44.68
At death their corpses wait only one fifth normal body weight

481
00:46:46.68 --> 00:46:48.68
Others were electrocuted

482
00:46:48.68 --> 00:46:50.68
Boyle the live

483
00:46:50.68 --> 00:46:56.60
killed in giant centrifuges or died from prolonged exposure to x-rays and

484
00:46:58.76 --> 00:47:01.000
All some 3,000 are said to have been murdered

485
00:47:03.40 --> 00:47:06.28
Some were just killed off when there was an excess of supply

486
00:47:07.96 --> 00:47:11.24
They were killed like animals in an abatua

487
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.76
Every bit of their bodies mercilessly

488
00:47:14.76 --> 00:47:20.76
We mercilessly used up in the name of the terrible medicine of military science

489
00:47:28.52 --> 00:47:30.52
Now

490
00:47:31.40 --> 00:47:32.36
As

491
00:47:32.36 --> 00:47:36.92
Is she went on with these experiments he was he got worried about something

492
00:47:36.92 --> 00:47:47.72
And this is what he got worried about back to the book there was a small but crucial chance that some of his weapons might not work on American or Anglo-Saxon racial groups

493
00:47:52.28 --> 00:47:59.88
In 1943 researcher Utsumi was sent on trips to intermongolia to study the immunities of Mongolians and other races

494
00:48:00.44 --> 00:48:03.48
Another had already been sent to a place called mucked in

495
00:48:03.48 --> 00:48:07.08
So mucked in another prison camp

496
00:48:07.48 --> 00:48:16.52
So he got concerned that as he did these experiments that some diseases affect different races differently and there was some chance that oh

497
00:48:16.52 --> 00:48:21.88
We've we'd use this type of bacteria against an Anglo-Saxon or white person it might not work

498
00:48:22.52 --> 00:48:24.52
So we got to we got to figure that one out

499
00:48:27.56 --> 00:48:28.92
Well the

500
00:48:28.92 --> 00:48:30.92
Japanese had captured Americans and

501
00:48:30.92 --> 00:48:32.92
Brits and Australians

502
00:48:36.36 --> 00:48:39.56
So here we're gonna hear a little bit about the prisoners in mucked in

503
00:48:40.28 --> 00:48:43.64
Okay, that is another prison camp back to the book or in w

504
00:48:44.36 --> 00:48:46.36
Welch

505
00:48:46.36 --> 00:48:48.36
known more familiarly as

506
00:48:48.92 --> 00:48:53.32
Papi came from Tulsa, Oklahoma was a master sergeant with the US 200

507
00:48:53.96 --> 00:48:58.44
200 coast artillery anti aircraft regiment on April 9

508
00:48:58.44 --> 00:49:02.76
1942 baton fell on May 6th

509
00:49:03.72 --> 00:49:05.72
So to correct or

510
00:49:05.72 --> 00:49:10.28
Papi Welch and 88,000 other Americans in Filipinos were captured

511
00:49:10.28 --> 00:49:17.16
Papi remembers it was the beginning of one of the most dehumanizing experiences ever perpetrated on humans

512
00:49:20.12 --> 00:49:26.04
Welch illness fellow prisoners had to endure the familiar ill treatment the Japanese met it out to prisoners of war

513
00:49:26.04 --> 00:49:28.04
a

514
00:49:28.04 --> 00:49:33.24
Proceeding that is understandable only if you'd from the Japanese standpoint that to die in battles honorable

515
00:49:33.24 --> 00:49:35.24
But to surrender is to be shamed

516
00:49:36.92 --> 00:49:38.20
But is also

517
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:40.20
dehumanizing because

518
00:49:40.20 --> 00:49:48.04
Unknown to him he was to become a human guinea pig in Japan's experimental program as they sought to build weapons of biological warfare

519
00:49:48.20 --> 00:49:55.08
Welch will has to spend three years of his life as one of the 1,485 American and British and

520
00:49:55.08 --> 00:50:00.68
Australian and New Zealand prisoners of war who were heard it into a special prison camp in

521
00:50:00.68 --> 00:50:02.68
Manchuria at Mookden

522
00:50:06.28 --> 00:50:08.28
And of course

523
00:50:09.24 --> 00:50:17.40
They hiked there back to the book the route the 1,000 American prisoners took to Mookden began with what became known as the baton death march

524
00:50:19.16 --> 00:50:23.16
We were subjected to beatings killings forced marches during the heat of the day

525
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:27.64
We were deprived of food water in any medical attention whatsoever

526
00:50:28.60 --> 00:50:30.60
Papi Welch will remembered

527
00:50:38.12 --> 00:50:42.36
They were penned in two camps in the Philippines hundreds more died both in the camp and

528
00:50:43.16 --> 00:50:49.96
From suffocation as more than 100 crammed into box cars on the journey from one camp to another

529
00:50:49.96 --> 00:50:55.72
Then in October of 1942 about a thousand US troops had been single about and marched to Manila

530
00:50:56.36 --> 00:51:00.44
The capital of the Philippines. They went aboard the Japanese vessel

531
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.04
Tutory

532
00:51:02.04 --> 00:51:04.04
Maru

533
00:51:05.16 --> 00:51:08.52
Then here's a quote from the moment we went aboard that hellship

534
00:51:09.48 --> 00:51:14.28
They were experimenting on us. They threw us aboard to see how much we could stand and how many of us died

535
00:51:14.60 --> 00:51:19.08
They took us from the tropics to a bitterly cold climate and that took its toll on us

536
00:51:19.08 --> 00:51:25.88
They gave us few crackers and little rice to eat and I feel that it was a systematic way of beginning to test us to

537
00:51:25.96 --> 00:51:30.60
Found out to find out how much the Americans and the British and Australians could endure

538
00:51:31.88 --> 00:51:33.88
And that was said by

539
00:51:34.12 --> 00:51:39.72
Gregg Rodriguez senior now retired from his career as a foreman in

540
00:51:40.36 --> 00:51:42.36
Henrietta Oklahoma

541
00:51:42.36 --> 00:51:45.40
Rodriguez was a private in 59 coastal

542
00:51:45.40 --> 00:51:51.88
All-terry core US army he survived the journey to mookden and three years in the camp itself

543
00:51:53.24 --> 00:51:55.24
Now there's another guy

544
00:51:55.24 --> 00:51:58.28
named Robert PD who was a

545
00:51:58.92 --> 00:52:00.92
Senior British officer

546
00:52:00.92 --> 00:52:09.64
And he was also in prison in mookden and he kept a daily diary or at least he tried to keep a daily diary and he kept it

547
00:52:10.60 --> 00:52:12.60
in code form

548
00:52:12.60 --> 00:52:14.60
but here's some

549
00:52:16.44 --> 00:52:18.44
Here's some of his

550
00:52:18.36 --> 00:52:20.36
entries into his journal

551
00:52:20.36 --> 00:52:22.36
19 April

552
00:52:22.04 --> 00:52:24.84
43 another Japanese medical investigated

553
00:52:25.64 --> 00:52:29.64
Investigations started today as apparently the findings of the first did not meet with approval

554
00:52:30.20 --> 00:52:32.60
24 May diarrhea is increasing

555
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.40
25 May waiting for medicine for diarrhea which was not forthcoming

556
00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:40.12
Men were ordered to exercise by playing baseball

557
00:52:40.12 --> 00:52:42.12
26 May

558
00:52:42.12 --> 00:52:46.92
Diagnosis of diarrhea consists of running the men around the parade ground

559
00:52:47.32 --> 00:52:51.96
I saw some of them with bare feet those who do not mess their pants or drop from exhaustion

560
00:52:51.96 --> 00:52:54.36
Are reckoned to be liars and are told to go back

561
00:52:55.64 --> 00:53:00.04
A protest has been made and a change is expected in both methods and personnel

562
00:53:00.52 --> 00:53:02.52
4 June

563
00:53:02.52 --> 00:53:04.92
3rd Japanese medical investigations started

564
00:53:05.88 --> 00:53:09.24
5 June anti-dissenti inoculation

565
00:53:09.24 --> 00:53:14.04
1.5 cc including flessure y 8 June

566
00:53:14.04 --> 00:53:16.52
Diary is still steadily increasing

567
00:53:17.24 --> 00:53:21.80
13 June second anti-dissentiary shot 1 cc

568
00:53:23.32 --> 00:53:25.32
6 August

569
00:53:25.32 --> 00:53:41.32
There are now 208 dead

570
00:53:41.72 --> 00:53:44.52
So as they're doing these experiments and they've got these dead bodies

571
00:53:45.80 --> 00:53:48.76
of American Australian British soldiers

572
00:53:48.76 --> 00:53:56.60
They're still trying to utilize them when they're dead to try and learn from them

573
00:53:58.68 --> 00:54:02.04
Back to the book one morning early in 1943

574
00:54:02.04 --> 00:54:05.32
Frank James was assigned to burial detail

575
00:54:05.32 --> 00:54:06.60
This is of some of those bodies

576
00:54:07.32 --> 00:54:12.60
I was pretty sick myself but I wouldn't go to the hospital because nobody that went in ever came out

577
00:54:12.60 --> 00:54:19.96
I went round to the hut and it must have been I reckoned 340 bodies stacked there each body had a tag

578
00:54:20.68 --> 00:54:22.68
attached to its toe

579
00:54:23.40 --> 00:54:26.84
There were two or three men who I took to be Japanese doctors there

580
00:54:27.16 --> 00:54:28.92
They were all masked 100 percent

581
00:54:29.64 --> 00:54:31.72
All the time they were there their faces were covered

582
00:54:32.84 --> 00:54:37.80
Another fellow and I were told to lift up the bodies and put them on the autopsy tables

583
00:54:37.80 --> 00:54:45.72
Then they began to cut them open they went deep into the stomach the bile the small intestine and they took what look like

584
00:54:46.04 --> 00:54:48.04
Pancreas and lungs

585
00:54:48.84 --> 00:54:52.04
They also operated on the heads and took part of the brain

586
00:54:58.60 --> 00:55:02.28
So just a heart a heart or show

587
00:55:02.28 --> 00:55:06.28
So for the prisoners

588
00:55:08.28 --> 00:55:14.04
The end of their incarceration in moonken was quite matter of fact and again this is a fast forward

589
00:55:14.04 --> 00:55:16.44
And it also skips ahead a little bit talking about how

590
00:55:17.80 --> 00:55:19.64
How the war ended and what that was like

591
00:55:21.32 --> 00:55:25.88
After days of rumor major pd's diary records for August 16th

592
00:55:25.88 --> 00:55:29.88
1945 six men were brought into camp this evening

593
00:55:29.88 --> 00:55:34.04
And from the fact that they were smoking more than the regulation distance from an astray

594
00:55:34.04 --> 00:55:36.04
We knew they were not prisoners of war

595
00:55:37.24 --> 00:55:42.20
After an unusually good supper all prisoners were released from the guard house

596
00:55:44.44 --> 00:55:49.64
Then he continues on this is on 20 August at about 7 p.m. a small Russian

597
00:55:50.44 --> 00:55:54.84
A small party of Russian officers arrived and announced that we are now

598
00:55:55.96 --> 00:55:57.96
free

599
00:55:57.96 --> 00:56:00.84
The Russian officer in charge said here they are

600
00:56:02.12 --> 00:56:06.60
Do what you like with them cut their throats or shoot them it's all the same to me

601
00:56:08.52 --> 00:56:12.84
But this was translated diplomatically as he says he hands them over to you

602
00:56:14.20 --> 00:56:21.64
For major pd and the hundreds who had survived the privations of moped in the victory was theirs in every sense

603
00:56:21.64 --> 00:56:26.84
They had no need they decided to seek reprisals

604
00:56:27.40 --> 00:56:29.88
It would have been said the major

605
00:56:31.08 --> 00:56:38.92
Beneath our dignity it would have reduced us to their level after all they had to live the rest of their lives with what they'd done

606
00:56:43.40 --> 00:56:45.000
So

607
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
the horror show ends and

608
00:56:47.40 --> 00:56:49.000
these

609
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.56
these soldiers that had been tortured and

610
00:56:52.36 --> 00:56:54.36
killed murdered

611
00:56:54.68 --> 00:57:01.16
They they decide they're not even gonna take revenge because they don't want to they don't want to lower themselves to that level that's an amazing

612
00:57:03.48 --> 00:57:05.48
But like I said that it skipped ahead

613
00:57:06.20 --> 00:57:08.20
The war still wasn't over and

614
00:57:09.16 --> 00:57:14.76
Here we go back to the book. Is she expected the final and decisive battle would take place between June and September

615
00:57:14.76 --> 00:57:19.72
1945 when America attempted to land on Japan proper

616
00:57:20.04 --> 00:57:25.48
Okinawa Japan's own island bastion fell in June the month before Germany had surrendered

617
00:57:25.48 --> 00:57:30.44
Russia urged by Britain and America at yalta turned their attention to Manchuria

618
00:57:31.40 --> 00:57:38.36
For forces swelled on both sides of the Soviet Manchuria and border as millions of troops remained at standoff point

619
00:57:38.36 --> 00:57:44.76
Tanaka's flee factory was expanded and given more staff with

620
00:57:45.48 --> 00:57:48.52
4,500 flee breeding machines and operation

621
00:57:48.92 --> 00:57:52.44
100 million insects could be produced every few days

622
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:54.28
Ishi plant a breed

623
00:57:54.44 --> 00:58:00.36
300 kilograms approximately one billion plague flees in the run-up to war

624
00:58:00.36 --> 00:58:08.36
Special training courses in flee breeding were set up at ping-fain and June and subunit members ordered

625
00:58:08.36 --> 00:58:11.64
back afterwards to establish their own production bases

626
00:58:13.08 --> 00:58:18.76
To propagate plague cultures and to feed the flees rats were needed in their thousands

627
00:58:18.76 --> 00:58:24.76
Yamada ordered every land unit of the Quantang Quantang army to trap rats

628
00:58:24.76 --> 00:58:34.84
Kaurasau is new conveyor system and again I'm throwing names in here that are explained with a lot more detail

629
00:58:34.84 --> 00:58:38.52
in the book that's why you buy the book and read the book so you can get the full picture

630
00:58:39.08 --> 00:58:42.76
Kaurasau is new conveyor system was working around the clock producing plague,

631
00:58:42.76 --> 00:58:48.60
typhoid, cholera and and throx organisms which were sufficient if correctly dispersed to in fact

632
00:58:48.60 --> 00:59:02.68
half the planet between midnight and 1 a.m. on the morning of August 9th after Hiroshima had been

633
00:59:02.68 --> 00:59:09.000
devastated by the atomic bomb the Soviet army swept across the border into Venturia and Korea

634
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.32
with a massive force of 1.5 million men 5,500 tanks and 5,000 airplanes

635
00:59:15.32 --> 00:59:22.68
the Quantang army was thrown into panic confusion broke loose that day or the day after

636
00:59:22.68 --> 00:59:29.40
Yamada ordered the destruction of units 731 and 100 again 731 we've been talking about

637
00:59:29.40 --> 00:59:33.40
100 who was another one of these parallel units that was doing the same type of stuff

638
00:59:34.20 --> 00:59:39.80
a nearby sapper unit was ordered to blow up ping-fain's main headquarters the units personnel

639
00:59:39.80 --> 00:59:45.96
were to destroy all evidence and be evacuated to sell Seoul in Korea a second bomb was yet to be

640
00:59:45.96 --> 00:59:51.08
dropped on the Nagasaki so here the war is obviously turning we dropped the bomb and they go to

641
00:59:51.08 --> 00:59:56.76
cover their tracks they've completely destroyed everything destroy the buildings destroy all the

642
00:59:56.76 --> 01:00:04.28
records destroy everything and when I say everything I mean everything here we go back to the book

643
01:00:04.28 --> 01:00:12.68
at ping-fain marutes were the first to be destroyed members of the five 16 chemical warfare unit

644
01:00:12.68 --> 01:00:19.80
gas the marutes by throwing flasks of toxic chemicals into their cells 600 local

645
01:00:19.80 --> 01:00:27.24
mentoring and Chinese laborers who worked at the Yagasawa plant disease farm and elsewhere at ping-fang

646
01:00:27.24 --> 01:00:36.92
were machine gun potassium cyanide poison was also put into the marute is breakfast food so

647
01:00:37.72 --> 01:00:41.48
they're just trying to like I said destroy everything and make it like it didn't happen

648
01:00:42.84 --> 01:00:48.92
and as they wrap this up the rest of unit 731 expecting a few left behind for final clearing up

649
01:00:48.92 --> 01:00:54.76
assembled on the 13th and 14th at the shunting yard each he made a formal speech

650
01:00:54.76 --> 01:01:02.20
extoling the memory of unit 731 and its diligent research as if in mockery of him

651
01:01:02.20 --> 01:01:09.24
it was interrupted by the sound of a prison exploding members were issued vials of poison

652
01:01:09.24 --> 01:01:14.28
he she had originally wished every branch member and all families in togo village to commit suicide

653
01:01:16.36 --> 01:01:23.64
with this proposal this proposal was met met the violent disagreement of major general

654
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:30.92
kikuchi 731's research chief nonetheless some took their lives without orders from ishi

655
01:01:32.84 --> 01:01:35.96
three thought they should all kill themselves got a little resistance there

656
01:01:37.56 --> 01:01:45.72
I would I would have thought that kikuchi perhaps would have provided more resistance

657
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:50.60
against the behavior that they were occurring to you not just to you just want to protect

658
01:01:50.60 --> 01:01:57.64
himself here at the end hey I'm not going to question anything as long as it doesn't

659
01:01:57.64 --> 01:02:03.88
affect me right that's what that is on august 15th the emperor broadcast japan's defeat

660
01:02:03.88 --> 01:02:11.96
and surrender it had never occurred to ishi that japan might give in he had to confirm the broadcast

661
01:02:11.96 --> 01:02:17.64
before believing it such was the shock that according to one account ishi was seen in a listless

662
01:02:17.64 --> 01:02:25.48
condition utterly crest falling that day in the late afternoon unit 731 train arrived at

663
01:02:25.48 --> 01:02:30.36
hens king there on the following night ishi made a final address to the

664
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.52
to his earnest wild troops he swore them to life in the shadows for the rest of their lives

665
01:02:39.64 --> 01:02:45.88
and the lie the candle held by an aid to camp ishi ordered them never to speak of their military past

666
01:02:45.88 --> 01:02:50.20
never to take official positions in the future and never again to contact each other

667
01:02:51.56 --> 01:02:58.60
it is a promise that some have kept to this day the pathetic end of japan's once mighty

668
01:02:58.60 --> 01:03:05.16
biological warfare effort was to let loose thousands of infected rats in the neighborhood of ping fan

669
01:03:06.68 --> 01:03:12.44
it caused a local plague epidemic which claimed many innocent lives into the summer of

670
01:03:12.44 --> 01:03:20.20
1946 a unit 100 a handful of infected horses were freed after the surrender

671
01:03:26.12 --> 01:03:30.20
yeah you know you hear that argument about the the dropping of the atomic bombs

672
01:03:31.24 --> 01:03:36.84
and the common argument is always it would have cost massive amounts of lives on both sides

673
01:03:36.84 --> 01:03:40.28
Americans and japanese because the america the japanese were going to fight to the death

674
01:03:40.28 --> 01:03:44.04
and the americans were going to kill them all and so the best thing to do is like okay we drop

675
01:03:44.04 --> 01:03:50.04
the atomic bombs this just kind of makes that a close deal in my mind you know you got people

676
01:03:50.04 --> 01:03:55.000
that are trying to they got enough enough biological weapon treated in fact half the world

677
01:03:57.88 --> 01:04:03.72
so and again jumping forward in this book get the book so that you can get the whole story

678
01:04:04.36 --> 01:04:09.64
but there's a massive infestigation that takes place to find out what's going on there's little leeks

679
01:04:09.64 --> 01:04:14.84
they they catch wind of little bit of it but not a lot of it and at one point there

680
01:04:14.84 --> 01:04:20.44
interrogating ishi and here's ishi did not any involvement our work was to protect soldiers

681
01:04:20.44 --> 01:04:25.96
he said did anyone else concerned themselves with biological warfare against crop plants

682
01:04:25.96 --> 01:04:31.96
I do not know replied ishi his interrogator made no effort to pursue the matter Thompson

683
01:04:31.96 --> 01:04:36.84
of veterinarian by training turned the questions of biological warfare against animals

684
01:04:36.84 --> 01:04:43.96
we did not do any experiments on large large animals said ishi we used small animals as

685
01:04:43.96 --> 01:04:53.72
test animals besides we had no veterinarians what field tests were made with the plague organism

686
01:04:53.72 --> 01:04:58.76
he asked due to the danger of it there were no field experiments with that organism

687
01:04:59.72 --> 01:05:03.96
there were great many field mice in menturia and it would have been dangerous to conduct field

688
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:08.20
experiments with plague because the field mice would very easily carry the organism since

689
01:05:08.20 --> 01:05:12.92
started an epidemic we conducted the experiments with plague in the laboratory said ishi

690
01:05:13.64 --> 01:05:18.92
what kind of experiments Thompson acquired we put rats and cages inside the room and sprayed the

691
01:05:18.92 --> 01:05:24.76
whole room with plague bacteria this was to determine how the rats became infected whether through

692
01:05:24.76 --> 01:05:29.56
the eyes knows mouth or through the skin what did you find out the test results were not too

693
01:05:29.56 --> 01:05:35.88
favorable we usually got 10% infection by which way that was the total said ishi misunderstanding

694
01:05:35.88 --> 01:05:42.04
the question what route was most effective Thompson repeated through the nose said ishi also

695
01:05:42.04 --> 01:05:49.64
through an open wound so they're interrogating he's been pretty he's lying he's covering up

696
01:05:50.20 --> 01:05:55.08
but there's there's a twist that we're going to see unfold here and I'll explain it a little bit

697
01:05:55.08 --> 01:06:03.64
so it makes sense as it comes forth the twist in this story is that the cold war was about to

698
01:06:03.64 --> 01:06:11.96
start the cold war was now starting and America these experiments that had taken place

699
01:06:11.96 --> 01:06:18.12
and knowledge had been gained through this through these evil experiments well America looked at

700
01:06:18.12 --> 01:06:23.16
the knowledge and recognized or saw that there could be knowledge that they didn't that we didn't

701
01:06:23.16 --> 01:06:32.12
have that America didn't have and and decided let's try and get this knowledge now one of the

702
01:06:32.12 --> 01:06:37.24
problems is and again this is going to unfold but I'll give a brief synopsis of it one of the

703
01:06:37.24 --> 01:06:42.20
problems is if you charge someone with war crimes and you put them on trial well you've got to

704
01:06:42.20 --> 01:06:47.16
say with their own what the war crimes are that they committed and if you say that the war crimes

705
01:06:47.16 --> 01:06:53.000
were committed were these experiments with chemical and biological weapons then people are going to know

706
01:06:54.92 --> 01:06:59.32
what the results of the experiments were and that means the knowledge is going to be out there

707
01:07:00.28 --> 01:07:06.04
and the knowledge could fall into the hands of people that we were now looking to be facing

708
01:07:06.04 --> 01:07:13.32
in another war which ended up being the cold war luckily not a full war so

709
01:07:13.32 --> 01:07:19.08
that's how this that's how this story continues to unfold back to the book there's no

710
01:07:19.08 --> 01:07:25.16
question that is an individual and many of the associates were guilty of serious war crimes

711
01:07:25.16 --> 01:07:31.80
as lieutenant general ishi was unissue undoubtably possessed sufficient high military rank

712
01:07:31.80 --> 01:07:38.28
to be classified as a class a war criminal he was the top of the tree in his own field his

713
01:07:38.28 --> 01:07:46.12
actions as the head of unit 731 qualified him as a criminal on many accounts not only was

714
01:07:46.12 --> 01:07:52.44
biological warfare considered extra legal by most countries but issue is also guilty of

715
01:07:52.44 --> 01:07:57.64
outrageous conventional war crimes he had carried out calculated human experimentations on

716
01:07:57.64 --> 01:08:03.000
prisoners of war a conventional war crime that had long been prescribed in the manials of military

717
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000
law of every major power he'd carried out similar research against innocent civilians

718
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.72
clearly a crime against humanity. Ishi had taken his biological weapon out of the research laboratory

719
01:08:15.72 --> 01:08:21.08
and used it in the field he had sought autonomy and independence of action for his biological

720
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:27.40
warfare forces throughout the war zones he had done nothing to restrain the conduct of his

721
01:08:27.40 --> 01:08:38.04
subordinates so this guy is as guilty as they come they there was other

722
01:08:40.60 --> 01:08:49.48
other events that took place that were equally bad and here we go some tribunals were held

723
01:08:49.48 --> 01:08:55.16
in China the Philippines and the Pacific Islands but most a total of 314 cases were held at

724
01:08:55.16 --> 01:09:01.72
Yokohama Japan at these courts a sufficient number of medical atrocity cases were heard for them

725
01:09:01.72 --> 01:09:08.28
to be considered as a special category the most well known and worst case presented by legal

726
01:09:08.28 --> 01:09:14.36
section at Yokohama concerned the fate of captured American flyers held by the Japanese western

727
01:09:14.36 --> 01:09:21.88
army in Q-Shu after April 1945 the appalling experiments to which they had been subjected

728
01:09:21.88 --> 01:09:32.84
included vivis section and the substitution of sea water for their blood for this gross

729
01:09:32.84 --> 01:09:39.56
act of barbarism on August 27, 1948 the nine Japanese involved were convicted and sentenced

730
01:09:39.56 --> 01:09:49.56
either to be hanged or to serve life imprisonment one professor ishi yama of kishu

731
01:09:49.56 --> 01:09:59.48
university committed suicide in prison so clearly they had the attitude of like we're going to

732
01:09:59.48 --> 01:10:03.40
get some of these guys that conducted experiments and that's exactly what should have

733
01:10:03.40 --> 01:10:10.20
been said happened and this was a much smaller number of people that were tortured and killed

734
01:10:10.20 --> 01:10:21.000
and used this human experience than what was used at 731 continued on called war tensions had been

735
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.52
increasing throughout 1946 the desire to meet outstern justice at the Tokyo trial was increasingly

736
01:10:28.52 --> 01:10:35.72
subsumed if found in conflict with the interests of national security Japan was in the front line

737
01:10:35.72 --> 01:10:45.48
so to now was biological warfare on August 24, 1946 Washington cabled MacArthur ordering him to protect

738
01:10:45.48 --> 01:10:52.04
intelligence especially scientific which might jeopardize America's national security it read

739
01:10:52.04 --> 01:10:56.52
under present circumstances intelligence relating to research and development in the field of science

740
01:10:56.52 --> 01:11:01.64
and war material should not be disclosed to nations other than the British Commonwealth

741
01:11:01.64 --> 01:11:09.08
biological warfare intelligence seems by this time to have become too much too sensitive to be brought

742
01:11:09.08 --> 01:11:15.32
into the glare of massive of a massive international trial throughout 1946 both Russia and

743
01:11:15.32 --> 01:11:21.32
America appear to have been reluctant to reveal their hands in Japan America appears to have

744
01:11:21.32 --> 01:11:25.96
taken some extra precautions to prevent information from falling into Soviet hands

745
01:11:25.96 --> 01:11:35.88
so you can see how it's unfolding one of these again one of these senior officers that has

746
01:11:35.88 --> 01:11:42.12
talked about deeply in the book but I didn't discuss too too much his name was NATO

747
01:11:44.28 --> 01:11:51.80
and here's a quote from NATO we want to corroborate and we owe it to the general headquarters

748
01:11:51.80 --> 01:11:57.32
but we have a responsibility to our friends we took an oath never to divulge information on human

749
01:11:57.32 --> 01:12:03.48
experiments we are afraid some of us will be prosecuted as war criminals we do not know how much

750
01:12:03.48 --> 01:12:12.20
others will be willing to give us if you can give us documentary immunity probably we can get everything

751
01:12:13.48 --> 01:12:18.84
the subordinates not the section chiefs know all the details if we contact someone who is a

752
01:12:18.84 --> 01:12:27.72
communist he is liable to tell the Russians the Japanese were given insurances that war crimes

753
01:12:27.72 --> 01:12:32.44
would not be involved

754
01:12:34.84 --> 01:12:39.56
MacArthur sent a five again fast forward from MacArthur sent a five part radio message to

755
01:12:39.56 --> 01:12:44.44
Washington showing the extent of his knowledge clear from part five they have the whole the whole

756
01:12:44.44 --> 01:12:49.64
message in the book it is clear from part five of the message that MacArthur favored gaining the

757
01:12:49.64 --> 01:12:56.12
biological warfare technical information by offering the assurances that data would not be employed

758
01:12:56.12 --> 01:13:04.76
at war crimes trials and here's E.C. I will not reveal the information to the Russians

759
01:13:04.76 --> 01:13:13.96
you can see how this is unfold this is like one of those horrible when a crime gets committed

760
01:13:13.96 --> 01:13:18.28
in for whatever little technicality people are getting off that's exactly what's going on

761
01:13:18.28 --> 01:13:27.32
and you can hear it unfolding and I mean it does national security trump the it's almost like an

762
01:13:27.32 --> 01:13:31.56
ego move right it's almost like an ego move you're going to make these guys pay it's also a

763
01:13:31.56 --> 01:13:37.16
morality move and it's a justice it's a guess beyond ego and beyond it's justice these guys

764
01:13:37.16 --> 01:13:43.40
were criminals these guys did heinous things to other human beings and they should pay and as strong

765
01:13:43.40 --> 01:13:50.04
as that case is it didn't seem to hold up to the case of national security we want to have this

766
01:13:50.04 --> 01:13:56.28
information not that we were going to use it but we better have it better to have it and not

767
01:13:56.28 --> 01:14:00.84
need it the need and not have it's better to have it yourself and not let your enemy have it

768
01:14:00.84 --> 01:14:05.24
which is the Russians at this point yeah so that's where the decisions getting made yeah so you

769
01:14:05.24 --> 01:14:10.84
got to kind of consider what's more important like this justice yeah that's exactly the question

770
01:14:10.84 --> 01:14:16.76
and answers pretty clear what the what the answer is safety right the I mean security

771
01:14:18.20 --> 01:14:23.24
yeah you can get all the justice yeah you can get all the justice you want but that it's

772
01:14:23.24 --> 01:14:31.08
going to create some serious problems in the future is kind of like you know is it worth it yeah and

773
01:14:31.08 --> 01:14:36.28
here's the issue talking some more I cannot give detailed technical data all the records were destroyed

774
01:14:36.28 --> 01:14:41.48
I never did know many details and I forgot in what I knew I can give you general results

775
01:14:42.52 --> 01:14:48.20
I've never heard of onto that's another base that they used until I returned to ping fan in

776
01:14:48.20 --> 01:14:54.20
1945 I did not visit the location I am responsible for all that went on at ping fan I am willing to

777
01:14:54.20 --> 01:14:59.56
shoulder all responsibility neither my superiors or my subordinates had anything to do with issuing

778
01:14:59.56 --> 01:15:04.44
instructions for experiments if you ask me specific questions I can tell you general results

779
01:15:06.12 --> 01:15:09.88
I am wholly responsible for ping fan I do not want to see any of my subordinates or

780
01:15:09.88 --> 01:15:16.60
superiors getting trouble for what occurred if you will give me documentary immunity for myself

781
01:15:16.60 --> 01:15:22.12
superiors subordinates and subordinates I can get you all the information for you

782
01:15:24.36 --> 01:15:29.16
so he's he's making a deal he's making a deal I said look I'm responsible for everything

783
01:15:29.72 --> 01:15:34.76
and what he's doing is saying look I'm responsible for everything and if you give me immunity I'll

784
01:15:34.76 --> 01:15:41.88
get you all the information you want he's actually a good move it's a good move on his part because

785
01:15:41.88 --> 01:15:46.44
he says I'm responsible for everything even if they say no we don't take a deal and we're going to hang you

786
01:15:46.44 --> 01:15:51.16
he's still he's still trying to protect of many as as many of his people as he can I'll band down the chain

787
01:15:51.16 --> 01:16:01.72
to command the advisability of complying with ishi's bargain war crimes immunity in written form

788
01:16:01.72 --> 01:16:07.16
in exchange for scientific data was to occupy some of Washington's most senior minds throughout the

789
01:16:07.16 --> 01:16:16.12
summer of 1947 ishi continued masuda canako and nato whom you say you know can give you a lot of

790
01:16:16.12 --> 01:16:22.36
information I would like to be hired by the United States as a biological warfare expert in preparation

791
01:16:22.36 --> 01:16:28.04
for the war with Russia I can give you the advantage of my 20 years research and experience I have

792
01:16:28.04 --> 01:16:33.16
given a great deal of thought to tactical problems in the defense against biological warfare I have made

793
01:16:33.16 --> 01:16:38.76
studies on the best agents to be employed in various regions and in cold climates I can write

794
01:16:38.76 --> 01:16:44.68
volume of a while biological warfare including the little thought of strategic and tactical employment

795
01:16:45.40 --> 01:16:48.68
God this God this is scumbag

796
01:16:54.52 --> 01:16:58.52
so it continues and open back to the book and it opened admission about human experimentation

797
01:16:58.52 --> 01:17:04.12
allegations about the the use of biological warfare even hints about the connection between unit 731

798
01:17:04.12 --> 01:17:09.64
and a member of the Japanese imperial family were all contained in the files of legal sections

799
01:17:09.64 --> 01:17:17.16
case 330 by the middle of 1947 how did this come about and why was nothing be done being done about

800
01:17:17.16 --> 01:17:23.88
the files contents so this is getting shut down that's what's happening now here's the sort of the more

801
01:17:23.88 --> 01:17:31.000
official opinion back to the book on balance the subcommittee felt it was desirable to avoid a

802
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.68
war crimes prosecution and here's what they said since it is believed that the USSR possesses

803
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:42.68
only a small portion of this technical information and since any war crimes trial would completely

804
01:17:42.68 --> 01:17:49.16
reveal such data to all nations it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in interests of

805
01:17:49.16 --> 01:17:55.64
defense and the security of the United States it is believed it is believed also that war crimes

806
01:17:55.64 --> 01:18:02.36
prosecution of eshi and his associates would serve to stop the flow of much additional information

807
01:18:02.36 --> 01:18:09.80
of a technical and scientific nature it is felt that the use of this information as a basis for

808
01:18:09.80 --> 01:18:16.12
war crimes evidence would be a grave detriment to Japanese cooperation with the United States

809
01:18:16.12 --> 01:18:26.44
occupation forces in Japan so there you hear the decisions getting made and that's the way it went

810
01:18:27.88 --> 01:18:35.40
and in the end going back to the book no member of unit 731 was called before any British or American

811
01:18:35.40 --> 01:18:45.16
military tribunal to account for war crimes none of them well actually not by any British or

812
01:18:45.16 --> 01:18:51.56
Americans because the Russians they still went after and they and when they went after them

813
01:18:51.56 --> 01:18:57.96
and they got some of them they made America look bad they had a big trial and here's the

814
01:18:57.96 --> 01:19:04.04
the state council the state council's name was smear off and here we go back to the book smear

815
01:19:04.04 --> 01:19:08.92
off spelled out a message intended for the ears of an audience thousands of miles from the courtroom

816
01:19:08.92 --> 01:19:15.72
these men ishi and the rest now ishi wasn't a part of this trial but ishi and the rest enjoy the

817
01:19:15.72 --> 01:19:23.000
protection of those reactionary forces in the imperialist camp who are themselves dreaming of a time

818
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:30.20
when they will be able to hurl upon mankind loads of tnt atomic bombs and lethal bacteria

819
01:19:30.20 --> 01:19:37.80
the accused received the sentences as follows and then they listed these guys that various

820
01:19:39.56 --> 01:19:45.16
soldiers and civilians that served in some of these biological warfare

821
01:19:46.04 --> 01:19:52.36
experimentation centers they got 25 years 20 years 18 years 15 years 12 years 10 years

822
01:19:52.36 --> 01:20:03.000
two years three years but again those sentences don't include ishi or the other main players at units

823
01:20:04.20 --> 01:20:11.64
731 because they got kind of protected not even kind of they got protected by America

824
01:20:12.44 --> 01:20:19.16
and exchange for their information sort of in response to everything that was going on there on December

825
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:25.72
27th 1941 the following story appeared in the New York Times date land Tokyo no knowledge MacArthur says

826
01:20:26.36 --> 01:20:31.80
general darkless MacArthur's headquarters said today there were no known cases in which

827
01:20:31.80 --> 01:20:37.32
Japanese used American prisoners in jernmore for experiments the headquarters added that the

828
01:20:37.32 --> 01:20:43.80
Japanese had done some experiments with animals although there was no evidence they had ever used human beings

829
01:20:43.80 --> 01:20:49.64
as far as it is known here no American's held prisoner by the Japanese that mook didn't ever

830
01:20:49.64 --> 01:20:55.000
accuse their captors of having used them as guinea pigs in biological warfare tests

831
01:20:57.24 --> 01:21:05.000
so that's all not true that's all not true back to the book to this day Russia has allowed

832
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.24
itself to bask in feelings of moral superiority over America and not without some justification

833
01:21:11.24 --> 01:21:22.92
in respect of the way it brought its unit 731 criminals to justice so just that's the way it

834
01:21:22.92 --> 01:21:31.24
flushed out now this you might think that's a little disturbing this is equally disturbing this

835
01:21:31.24 --> 01:21:39.88
just horrible back to the book after the war most of the scientists of unit 731 prospered

836
01:21:41.72 --> 01:21:47.24
much is explained by the clear complicity on the part of the United States authorities in the war

837
01:21:47.24 --> 01:21:54.68
crimes of unit 731 the detachments civilian researchers and other associated scientists were quite

838
01:21:54.68 --> 01:22:04.76
free to return to academia and it goes through this lit this multiple page list of of guys that

839
01:22:04.76 --> 01:22:09.72
went on to work at the research institute for natural resources chief and you know another guy was

840
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:20.36
chief research section at a pharmaceutical company doctor ishi kawa once a pathologist at unit 731

841
01:22:20.36 --> 01:22:26.36
who had brought home within thousands of human pathological samples became a professor at at a

842
01:22:26.36 --> 01:22:33.16
university in 1944 a position he held throughout the 1960s and 70s he eventually became president of

843
01:22:33.16 --> 01:22:40.68
the university's medical school the local newspaper once planned to award him with a metal for his

844
01:22:40.68 --> 01:22:47.48
contribution to society but after students who knew of his wartime record objected the war was canceled

845
01:22:47.48 --> 01:22:56.84
so these guys carried on another guy professor of show a university from a ecological another

846
01:22:57.72 --> 01:23:07.32
professor of bacteriologically a Kyoto university the list goes on on and on doctor

847
01:23:07.32 --> 01:23:16.36
he sought to Yoshimura who directed unit 731's frostbite experiments literally freezing people

848
01:23:16.36 --> 01:23:24.20
the death became a faculty member at the Kyoto perfectural medical college in the 1950s and later it's

849
01:23:24.20 --> 01:23:36.52
president and like i said that list goes on and on and of course he still haven't heard about

850
01:23:36.52 --> 01:23:42.12
ishi yet the mastermind behind this whole thing here we go back to the book ishi inherited much

851
01:23:42.12 --> 01:23:47.16
of the family's property in cameo village because if you remember cameo villages where they bring

852
01:23:47.16 --> 01:23:51.80
all these prison guards from their home village so that they'd get the complete loyalty from

853
01:23:51.80 --> 01:23:56.76
them so he inherited much of the properties family the family property in cameo village is to

854
01:23:56.76 --> 01:24:05.32
elder brothers tecao and mitzuo were childless unlike shiro who fathered six children tecao unit 731

855
01:24:05.32 --> 01:24:10.84
special prison squad leader eventually died of liver cancer and Kobe the city went to his second

856
01:24:10.84 --> 01:24:19.000
wife had come mitzuo who wants to provide the the unit's animal house outlived his younger brother

857
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.48
shiro but was unable to work after the war and lived on money gained by selling his country property

858
01:24:25.48 --> 01:24:33.32
mitzuo and tecao and their eldest brother torael who had been killed in the ruso

859
01:24:34.04 --> 01:24:39.80
japanese war during japan's major period are buried in the ishi family cemetery at cameo

860
01:24:39.80 --> 01:24:49.48
on august 17th 1958 13 years after the end of the war in the back room of a stone mason shop

861
01:24:50.12 --> 01:24:56.52
near tomah cemetery stokeo ishi made his first and apparently only post war appearance

862
01:24:56.52 --> 01:25:05.40
before assembled at junior members of his former unit he reminisced about the early days of

863
01:25:05.40 --> 01:25:12.92
unit 731 in a speech reportedly still rich in xenophobia and elitism he she described how his

864
01:25:12.92 --> 01:25:20.12
unit was to have been the salvation of japan a country then encircled by the west scientifically

865
01:25:20.12 --> 01:25:26.12
impoverished yet spiritually rich he apologized for their suffering since the end of the war

866
01:25:26.12 --> 01:25:37.96
but urged his audience to remain proud of the memory of unit 731 and here's a little part of his

867
01:25:37.96 --> 01:25:44.76
what he said it was in order that we could have precious human material that the unit 731

868
01:25:46.12 --> 01:25:53.16
was set for the saving of the nation national circumstances were not permitting

869
01:25:53.16 --> 01:26:07.000
unfortunately we did not achieve our aims so even after all that even after all that even looking

870
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:14.20
back after 13 years after the end of the war he's looking back and and still has the same mindset

871
01:26:14.20 --> 01:26:18.44
and that meant how could he's hard to understand and I want to shed a little bit of light on that

872
01:26:18.44 --> 01:26:29.000
mentality and do that through some personal accounts of what happened at unit 731 and that's

873
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:37.32
from this other book it's called unit 731 testimony and let's go to this book and I think these

874
01:26:37.32 --> 01:26:48.20
make it pretty clear where this mentality comes from so this account is from a captain

875
01:26:48.20 --> 01:26:55.96
in the Japanese imperial army named Kojima Kojima te kaio and here we go perhaps there are some

876
01:26:55.96 --> 01:27:04.60
people here and and by the way most of these accounts are from an exhibition that went around

877
01:27:04.60 --> 01:27:09.56
Japan kind of explaining what happened and people would come to this exhibition and they would capture

878
01:27:09.56 --> 01:27:13.72
if someone was involved in unit 731 or someone remembered or someone had a story about it they

879
01:27:13.72 --> 01:27:20.12
would capture their account and that's what this book has a lot of from this ex but this exhibition

880
01:27:20.12 --> 01:27:25.32
that they did I think it was in the mid 1990s that they did this exhibition so this particular

881
01:27:25.32 --> 01:27:33.32
person that was showed up at this exhibition he was a captain the Japanese army his name is Kojima te kaio

882
01:27:34.52 --> 01:27:40.68
and here's what he said perhaps there are some people here at this unit 731 exhibition

883
01:27:40.68 --> 01:27:49.32
who think that this was all there was to jippit japanese aggression at the time unit 731 was

884
01:27:49.32 --> 01:27:55.96
merely one segment of the dark shadow of Japan's aggression and I would like to tell of my

885
01:27:55.96 --> 01:28:02.20
experience in this and I think this is why I pulled this one specifically because this talks about

886
01:28:02.20 --> 01:28:10.04
where this came from where this mentality came from that issue had to the end we were born and

887
01:28:10.04 --> 01:28:17.48
raised in a society of emperorsum a person's absolute responsibility above the army and government

888
01:28:17.48 --> 01:28:24.76
was to the emperor the emperor was a living deity the emperor's command was supreme and controlled

889
01:28:24.76 --> 01:28:31.88
the entire country we were told how we must serve the emperor how we should behave toward our

890
01:28:31.88 --> 01:28:37.08
parents how should we we should behave toward our teachers and how should we should behave toward our

891
01:28:37.08 --> 01:28:44.92
siblings we were taught that Japan is a sacred country that the people of Japan are a superior race

892
01:28:44.92 --> 01:28:53.16
that the people of china korea south east Asia and Russia were all inferior races and the superior

893
01:28:53.16 --> 01:29:00.68
race must govern them and by doing so we would bring them happiness this was the cause to which

894
01:29:00.68 --> 01:29:08.92
Japan must devote itself he goes on again I'm not reading the entire thing but you have to get the

895
01:29:08.92 --> 01:29:14.68
book to get these entire accounts soon after we went into service we were given training to get our

896
01:29:14.68 --> 01:29:22.60
courage up we were ordered to watch beheadings chinese were made to sit by a hole in the ground

897
01:29:22.60 --> 01:29:30.84
and the season soldiers would cut their heads off blood spurred up from the neck into the air

898
01:29:30.84 --> 01:29:38.68
and the bodies would roll into the holes then we had bayonet practice victims had their hands tied

899
01:29:38.68 --> 01:29:46.12
behind them around a tree and were used as bayonet targets we had to watch this as part of our training

900
01:29:46.12 --> 01:29:52.28
this was a shock to me and for two or three days food would not pass through my throat

901
01:29:54.12 --> 01:30:00.60
but two years later I became an officer in charge of a platoon and with about 25 men under me

902
01:30:02.04 --> 01:30:07.16
later I became a company commander with a hundred and fifty one men and that meant

903
01:30:07.16 --> 01:30:13.96
that if I didn't build a strong platoon and a strong company I would fall behind and so I too

904
01:30:13.96 --> 01:30:22.60
tested the courage of the soldiers under me by using chinese prisoners this was normal training

905
01:30:22.60 --> 01:30:33.24
in the Japanese army when we were not involved in major operations we would go out into our

906
01:30:33.24 --> 01:30:40.68
own immediate area on continuous three-day operations to see if there were any enemy around on such

907
01:30:40.68 --> 01:30:48.36
occasions we stole tortured and slaughtered people the chinese had a saying about us that

908
01:30:48.36 --> 01:30:55.64
Japan had a three-way complete policy burned completely killed completely and pillaged completely

909
01:30:57.24 --> 01:31:03.88
yet when we were doing those things we had no sense of guilt or of doing anything wrong

910
01:31:03.88 --> 01:31:22.04
it was for the emperor for the country so that's how the rest and that's how you can

911
01:31:22.04 --> 01:31:27.40
put someone like yeeshie that goes through all that and still remains loyal even after defeat

912
01:31:27.40 --> 01:31:41.08
still remains loyal to the deposed emperor and here's an army doctor named uosah Ken this is not

913
01:31:41.08 --> 01:31:48.44
easy for me to speak about but it is something I must confess what I did was wrong

914
01:31:51.16 --> 01:31:56.84
it is also true that it was forced on me by the government but that does not reduce the size of

915
01:31:56.84 --> 01:32:05.80
my crime it is something that happened a long time ago but those who are not taught about the war are

916
01:32:05.80 --> 01:32:13.56
ill-educated the Japanese army went to plunder and steel materials and to kill

917
01:32:15.40 --> 01:32:21.64
Japan wanted iron, coal and provisions and the army drove into the mountains to prosecute the war

918
01:32:21.64 --> 01:32:31.48
at the time the Japanese used derogatory terms for the chinese like chinamen and

919
01:32:31.48 --> 01:32:39.32
chink and looked at them with contempt when I was a child we were told to despise the chinese

920
01:32:39.32 --> 01:32:46.20
despise the Koreans it's all right to conquer them we have become elite and should join with the

921
01:32:46.20 --> 01:32:52.20
Americans in British and conquer Asia I hated war and killing but around middle school and into

922
01:32:52.20 --> 01:33:01.000
college I began to think that such ideas were unavoidable people were driven into a life

923
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.44
which human qualities in which human qualities were lost the soldiers outlet for frustrations

924
01:33:08.44 --> 01:33:15.88
was the brothel of the comfort women any means was resorted to in order to raise one's rank

925
01:33:15.88 --> 01:33:24.84
and keep up the authority of the country and in the army hospital we practiced vivis section

926
01:33:26.92 --> 01:33:31.56
living persons are good for the scalpel practice so people were brought in

927
01:33:33.72 --> 01:33:38.92
one day soon after I started at the assignment the hospital had told us today we will have surgery

928
01:33:38.92 --> 01:33:47.64
practice I was startled it was an order there was no getting out of it normally we dissected people

929
01:33:47.64 --> 01:33:54.60
who had died of such diseases as typhoid fever, dysentery and tuberculosis now we were being taken

930
01:33:54.60 --> 01:34:00.60
to the section room for a different type of exercise soldiers came along as observers

931
01:34:02.84 --> 01:34:08.52
everything started with a signal from the hospital head one chinese had big thighs and walk slowly

932
01:34:08.52 --> 01:34:14.20
and calmly he laid down and had no sign of fear no stress on his face he was composed

933
01:34:16.60 --> 01:34:21.96
someone else used him for surgery practice I went over and pushed the other one onto the operating

934
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:31.24
table I had no feeling of apology or of doing anything bad the farmer was resigned to his fate

935
01:34:31.24 --> 01:34:39.48
and he lowered his head and walked forward I didn't want to get my clothes dirty from him I wanted

936
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:46.36
to look sharp he went down as far as the operating table but didn't want to lie down

937
01:34:47.96 --> 01:34:54.60
a nurse using broken chinese told him we're using ether it won't hurt so lie down

938
01:34:54.60 --> 01:35:03.24
she gave me a rise smile when she said that she had been working there for a long time

939
01:35:03.24 --> 01:35:07.88
and when I happened to meet her again much later and asked her about it she didn't remember

940
01:35:09.88 --> 01:35:18.20
she was handling so many vivis sections it was routine people who repeat evil acts do not

941
01:35:18.20 --> 01:35:27.08
remember them there is no sense of wrongdoing war means this also war is not just shooting

942
01:35:27.08 --> 01:35:32.44
in order for Japan to win all the chinese were made prisoners women's bellies were cut open

943
01:35:33.08 --> 01:35:39.56
homes were burned if you couldn't do this then you weren't a loyal soldier of the emperor

944
01:35:39.56 --> 01:35:51.72
even if one despises an act one must bear it from there a person becomes accustomed to it

945
01:35:52.60 --> 01:35:58.60
we all received practiced it was normal to smile at this the crimes committed during our aggressive

946
01:35:58.60 --> 01:36:11.96
wars are forgotten gone from memory at the time they were considered right so the surgery began

947
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:18.04
the man was given ether and dissected his appendix was so small that it was like looking for a

948
01:36:18.04 --> 01:36:26.20
burling worm I had to cut and search repeatedly the blood flow was stopped nerves were cut

949
01:36:26.20 --> 01:36:33.24
bones were cut with a saw and a tracheotomy was performed blood and air escape from his body

950
01:36:33.24 --> 01:36:43.08
the blood came foaming up practice time was two hours the man died and his body was thrown into a

951
01:36:43.08 --> 01:37:00.76
hole and buried that was my first crime after that it was easy eventually I dissected 14 chinese

952
01:37:03.88 --> 01:37:10.52
I also saw vivis sections once I saw about 40 doctors gathered there was a man bound and

953
01:37:10.52 --> 01:37:17.72
squatting the guard asked the doctors are you ready and the prisoner was laid out without anesthetic

954
01:37:17.72 --> 01:37:24.28
two cuts were made down as belly the victim made a few gas the dissection was a botch and he

955
01:37:24.28 --> 01:37:35.88
died soon I saw four people dissected that way it is said that there are that there were 20

956
01:37:35.88 --> 01:37:45.24
million victims of the war in China but only 10 to 20% of these were killed in gunfire exchange

957
01:37:45.24 --> 01:37:54.44
most non-resisting old people women and children were captured and slaughtered prisoners of war

958
01:37:54.44 --> 01:37:59.80
could not be taken to the front or allowed to escape so they were killed in the manner of the rape of

959
01:37:59.80 --> 01:38:09.16
NAN King those who were a part of it do not come forward to tell the people how it was

960
01:38:09.96 --> 01:38:22.76
why because the Japanese have forgotten all about it everybody's forgotten they did things

961
01:38:22.76 --> 01:38:32.60
and got medals and they don't think they did anything worse than kicking a dog they weren't bothered

962
01:38:33.40 --> 01:38:39.72
because they never considered a dreadful thing to take a scalpel and cut open a living person

963
01:38:39.72 --> 01:39:00.04
and this will be the last piece of testimony that I read and this was a soldier that was

964
01:39:00.04 --> 01:39:12.20
attached to unit 731 named O'Hara Takiyoshi and he said I joined the cavalry

965
01:39:13.80 --> 01:39:20.20
from my home in 1939 in April of that year I was stationed in northeast China then in March

966
01:39:20.20 --> 01:39:31.48
1942 I was transferred to unit 731 I did not know anything about that unit my first duty was

967
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:42.20
taken care of domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, horses and cows I assisted in researching

968
01:39:42.20 --> 01:39:51.48
the diseases that affect these animals I saw tests in which Maruta were tied to crosses in a large

969
01:39:51.48 --> 01:40:00.68
circle as planes flew over and dropped bacteriological bombs in the area surrounded by the crosses

970
01:40:02.52 --> 01:40:09.80
their legs were chained and their bodies tied tightly we observed the tests from a distance of about

971
01:40:09.80 --> 01:40:19.16
200 meters I had the job of cleaning up and disinfecting after the experiments and gathering to

972
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:36.60
bring lying around I want people who come to this exhibition to tell their children and grandchildren that there is nothing more stupid and fearful

973
01:40:36.60 --> 01:41:03.56
then more nothing more stupid and fearful then more and I think that's a good quote to end this

974
01:41:03.56 --> 01:41:18.12
except for it is wrong it is wrong because as stupid and as fearful and as reprehensible as war is

975
01:41:18.12 --> 01:41:31.16
there is something worse than war and that is allowing this kind of evil to exist

976
01:41:37.24 --> 01:41:46.12
as bad as war is and war is awful war is hell and I have said that over and over again as

977
01:41:46.12 --> 01:41:56.92
have many others but there are worse things than war things like unit 731 things like the Nazi

978
01:41:56.92 --> 01:42:05.80
concentration camps things like the rape of Nand King there are things that are worse than war

979
01:42:05.80 --> 01:42:12.52
and there are times when war is not only justified but it is a moral obligation

980
01:42:12.52 --> 01:42:32.20
and I do not say that lightly but when evil and when darkness and when malevolent and demonic spirits rise to power

981
01:42:32.20 --> 01:42:46.76
they must be stopped in the responsibility for that lies within all of us every day to do our best

982
01:42:46.76 --> 01:43:01.72
to do our best to move the world away from the darkness and the demons that linger inside men's minds

983
01:43:01.72 --> 01:43:30.92
and move the world toward the light and toward what is good and I think that is all I have

984
01:43:30.92 --> 01:43:44.44
got for tonight so echo Charles I think while I decompress a little bit if you could

985
01:43:45.72 --> 01:43:51.32
talk about ways for the crew here to move towards the light I'm gonna try

986
01:43:51.32 --> 01:44:01.40
I know I know and if you think about originally when we started getting into these kind of podcast

987
01:44:01.40 --> 01:44:11.48
that touched upon some heavy some very disturbing subject matter that was that was where the whole

988
01:44:11.48 --> 01:44:23.16
sort of ex that's called extended closing to the show began yeah kind of yeah could just

989
01:44:23.16 --> 01:44:29.64
and and I remember like I remember like the first time I said you like hey man you just talk for a little while

990
01:44:30.44 --> 01:44:36.28
I need a break over here yeah that's how we ended up with this this thing yeah but then the

991
01:44:36.28 --> 01:44:40.92
interesting thing people would say hey thanks for doing that yeah because you're not the only one that needs

992
01:44:40.92 --> 01:44:46.44
decompress after you hear this freaking crap yeah after you hear about this just heinous evil yeah

993
01:44:47.08 --> 01:44:52.92
that really happened yeah we need a little break we need a little echo Charles here

994
01:44:54.92 --> 01:44:59.96
to you know yeah that's that's rough where you you know you go from

995
01:44:59.96 --> 01:45:07.56
vivis section you know and then what if you were like hey all right that's all I got for

996
01:45:07.56 --> 01:45:13.48
tonight yeah yeah yeah then you kind of all right you turn off you go into I don't know work

997
01:45:14.04 --> 01:45:21.48
whatever whenever you let's do it go to bed no that's that came out with with 121 122 and 123

998
01:45:21.48 --> 01:45:28.28
with Louis Polymer and with Chester Polylor and then Jake Shick I wasn't gonna do

999
01:45:28.28 --> 01:45:36.12
I I I said to myself I can't do 121 and 122 and just leave 122 out there in the world by itself

1000
01:45:36.12 --> 01:45:41.08
I need to Jake Shick my brother to come on and like show that you can get through that you know

1001
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:48.12
and so this is kind of the same thing you know I just can't like walk off yeah yeah my

1002
01:45:48.12 --> 01:45:53.16
drop and then oh yeah hey you guys deal with it now no we're gonna deal with it together that's

1003
01:45:53.16 --> 01:45:58.36
yeah we're gonna have echo Charles help us deal with it so come back a little bit a little bit try

1004
01:45:58.36 --> 01:46:02.28
kind of camp forget I mean it's been you're not gonna forget that you know and you just like

1005
01:46:02.28 --> 01:46:08.04
you can't forget machetes and you can't forget the reaper banking so you can remember but

1006
01:46:08.04 --> 01:46:16.76
camp forget the mili masquer yeah the harsh I mean it's it's it's crazy yeah but yeah man oh

1007
01:46:16.76 --> 01:46:29.72
far beyond from our intention to leave you with bad feelings that last we want I've said this before

1008
01:46:29.72 --> 01:46:37.000
right we want you to remember but not dwell yes right I think that's important I speak you know

1009
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.16
you're doing with loss I mean I talk about that a lot when you're dealing with loss yeah you always

1010
01:46:41.16 --> 01:46:48.04
want to remember the people you've lost but you can't dwell on it and you always want to remember

1011
01:46:48.04 --> 01:46:53.000
the reaper banking you always want to remember machetes he's and you always want to remember unit

1012
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.80
731 you always want to remember man search for meaning you always want to remember me I

1013
01:46:57.80 --> 01:47:02.36
mask you want to remember those things because they're real and they happen and they can happen again

1014
01:47:02.36 --> 01:47:09.56
if we let them yeah we can't dwell on them because there's there's because you know what we won

1015
01:47:09.56 --> 01:47:17.16
good one and good will win yeah it's what I'm thinking yeah fully you know okay there's this

1016
01:47:17.16 --> 01:47:25.56
movie called something about a centipede human centipede maybe there's a lot of

1017
01:47:25.56 --> 01:47:32.04
literally no possible way I've seen this movie yeah yeah I've never seen it I've seen the

1018
01:47:32.04 --> 01:47:36.76
the the you know we're usually like completely like psychosec dysturvy yeah yeah we're

1019
01:47:36.76 --> 01:47:42.44
gonna be a scientist guy yeah yeah you know I can't help but kind of think you know it's when you

1020
01:47:42.44 --> 01:47:46.04
said this isn't a movie this is this really happened and that's really the hard part when you

1021
01:47:46.04 --> 01:47:52.04
really start to think about it like just like how we're sitting here right now what's really hard

1022
01:47:52.92 --> 01:48:00.76
is you know you you picture the mother in a gas chamber with her baby and you you can't just

1023
01:48:00.76 --> 01:48:07.56
picture a mother you can't just picture a child you have to like picture a mother and a child

1024
01:48:07.56 --> 01:48:12.44
that you know you need to put that in you need to picture someone that you can't you can't make

1025
01:48:12.44 --> 01:48:18.04
that connection be saying a mother and a child that doesn't that doesn't bring it together for you

1026
01:48:18.04 --> 01:48:25.000
you actually have to picture someone you know and their kid being for that's what you need to

1027
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.88
picture being for because that's what those people are they were people they were people with

1028
01:48:29.88 --> 01:48:33.80
alive and they had hopes and dreams and all those things and they got put into a gas chamber to

1029
01:48:33.80 --> 01:48:43.16
see how long they could last without a gas mask that's what you have to picture yeah it makes the

1030
01:48:43.16 --> 01:48:51.32
point for sure what oh here's a moral question okay you know how like some of these doctors

1031
01:48:51.32 --> 01:48:59.64
and a scientist they went on to be prosperous you know after the deal and they obviously

1032
01:48:59.64 --> 01:49:04.84
I mean apparently some of them did some really good work where they're getting like awards and whatnot

1033
01:49:04.84 --> 01:49:09.48
and you know what speaking of this I was thinking about this because another really dark book

1034
01:49:09.48 --> 01:49:14.36
that we covered on here was ordinary men which ordinary men talked about the the police the

1035
01:49:14.36 --> 01:49:19.40
the Nazi police that went from being normal guys that were middle aged hadn't been indoctrinated

1036
01:49:19.40 --> 01:49:26.04
in the Nazi way of life as children they got kind of like swept along with the rest of the

1037
01:49:26.04 --> 01:49:33.000
Germans and they ended up committing these heinous acts and murdering thousands and thousands of

1038
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:40.84
of Jews but what's interesting about that so in that story it's normal guys going evil in this

1039
01:49:40.84 --> 01:49:46.60
story these evil guys that did evil things they come out the other side and kind of like go normal

1040
01:49:46.60 --> 01:49:52.20
right and they it's just so did they didn't they get kind of they got forced into it though right

1041
01:49:52.20 --> 01:49:57.40
remember they were like hey hey you gotta do this or you die they did get well not really

1042
01:49:57.40 --> 01:50:02.60
if you remember in ordinary men they're commander action in the beginning it's like hey if you

1043
01:50:02.60 --> 01:50:06.36
want to if you don't want to do this go home right no I mean the the Japanese there's definitely

1044
01:50:06.36 --> 01:50:10.36
one there's definitely some guys getting forced into it yeah so you here so here's the

1045
01:50:10.36 --> 01:50:14.92
more question is like okay of course you know these guys committed crimes regardless of you know

1046
01:50:14.92 --> 01:50:21.24
the surrounding circumstances they committed these crimes is factual and then they kind of get away

1047
01:50:21.24 --> 01:50:27.000
and then they get into normal society and they and they don't get punished right proceed like

1048
01:50:27.72 --> 01:50:35.80
no justice right no justice but so here's the more questions so does is it did they make up

1049
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:43.64
even a little bit further crime by doing good in the future even though they didn't get punished

1050
01:50:43.64 --> 01:50:49.96
like did they make up for it or is it more of a crime because they got to do good stuff they got to

1051
01:50:51.16 --> 01:50:56.36
get awards and they got to be prosecuted in the prosperous and they shouldn't the end either what

1052
01:50:56.36 --> 01:51:02.12
if you look at it from the perspective of like hey let's look at them hold it so there's

1053
01:51:02.12 --> 01:51:06.60
there's there's two ways I'm gonna stage this for you look at it holistically from like okay

1054
01:51:06.60 --> 01:51:11.08
here's this person let's look at it from my from joccos perspective here's this person they did

1055
01:51:11.08 --> 01:51:15.56
these horrible things but now they've kind of got back on track and they've put their life

1056
01:51:15.56 --> 01:51:20.84
together and and that's that's a positive thing and they've even if you can't make up for that

1057
01:51:20.84 --> 01:51:25.48
whole crime at least you're chipping away at some of the horrible things you did in replacing

1058
01:51:25.48 --> 01:51:30.36
something good and and you can see where people come to the conclusion that like well okay I can

1059
01:51:30.36 --> 01:51:35.96
kind of see how that makes sense that's one way of looking at it or others too by the way not just

1060
01:51:35.96 --> 01:51:41.48
and I mean it's easy to be like hey he got to do all this but if they're doing good work scientifically

1061
01:51:41.48 --> 01:51:46.52
and for you know medical schools and stuff like this is obviously they're teaching people

1062
01:51:46.52 --> 01:51:51.000
they're probably you know making breakthroughs and you know discoveries in the field and stuff

1063
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.08
that's gonna help people in general you know now here's the other way I'm gonna frame it for you

1064
01:51:55.88 --> 01:52:03.48
is from the eyes of that mother who's in that gas chamber who's watching that switch get turned

1065
01:52:03.48 --> 01:52:10.12
and she knows it's gonna kill her and her child and there's no there's no redemption zero

1066
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:20.12
check good job trying to lighten up the mood over here you're all you well hey man you know

1067
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:26.92
all right well hey let's talk some support some support we can support we're dwelling we're

1068
01:52:26.92 --> 01:52:33.64
dwelling we're breaking our we're breaking our our own code here we're dwelling good code yes all right

1069
01:52:33.64 --> 01:52:38.12
well let's talk about origin I feel like we should talk about origin and the first thing about

1070
01:52:38.12 --> 01:52:45.88
origin that I will talk about is the geese the flagship product geese all made in America by the way

1071
01:52:46.52 --> 01:52:52.92
rashcards as well this is for jiu-jitsu by the way specifically but not limited too so while the geese are

1072
01:52:52.92 --> 01:52:58.52
kind limited to unless you want to make a dragon we suit like you're the one who recommend

1073
01:52:58.52 --> 01:53:03.24
you could do you know you could do you know in a yeah I guess technically you could do

1074
01:53:03.24 --> 01:53:08.04
karate too if you want technically I mean but they're made for jiu-jitsu the rashcards made for

1075
01:53:08.04 --> 01:53:14.84
jiu-jitsu but you can use it for like cycling and body boarding and whatnot anything that you want

1076
01:53:14.84 --> 01:53:23.72
to protect yourself from rashes not at but not jure rashes like rashes actually it does have

1077
01:53:23.72 --> 01:53:30.12
anti-microbial stuff in it too so it is kind of protect from it anyway origin main dot com that's

1078
01:53:30.12 --> 01:53:39.56
where you can get this stuff all made in America and also joggers coming from the condos who have

1079
01:53:39.56 --> 01:53:45.24
come for himself that's me people are so calm at about that yes they are you're now becoming known

1080
01:53:45.24 --> 01:53:50.92
yeah maybe you could parlay that until like a whole thing yeah like a whole thing yeah yeah just have

1081
01:53:50.92 --> 01:53:57.000
your own thing no no listing things were comfort levels yeah all established a standard of comfort

1082
01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.28
it'll be called the concept of comfort scale seems like you know how like in temperature there's

1083
01:54:02.28 --> 01:54:09.08
like Kelvin yeah Celsius Fahrenheit yeah I'll be that for comfort the echo scale yeah echo scale of comfort

1084
01:54:09.08 --> 01:54:13.72
what would the highest level of comfort be would it just be one to ten you know it'd be uh oh you

1085
01:54:13.72 --> 01:54:21.80
oh joy what would be the highest what's that ranking oh joy origin joggers oh

1086
01:54:21.80 --> 01:54:27.56
oh dad it's like I'm over here I'm like I'm getting a peat for some reason he's the kind

1087
01:54:27.56 --> 01:54:32.20
guy I like to just call you know how you like you'll text someone you know really I want to

1088
01:54:32.20 --> 01:54:38.60
you know really but nowadays we like to text people you know I'm not gonna bother them I'm not gonna you know but

1089
01:54:38.60 --> 01:54:45.08
I'm for some reason I like to call peat so call them and I'll be like hey when the shorts come

1090
01:54:45.08 --> 01:54:50.44
yeah not first so we can you know because I want to wear them you know that kind of stuff

1091
01:54:50.44 --> 01:54:54.36
anyway so I'm about to call them and be like hey we need more colors of joggers or whatever but

1092
01:54:54.36 --> 01:54:59.80
here's the thing do we I need more colors so I can't just be running peat around his factory

1093
01:54:59.80 --> 01:55:06.36
making new colors just for me personally or maybe I can't I don't but it would help but yeah there

1094
01:55:06.36 --> 01:55:11.40
they're real good joggers uh T-shirts and hoodies and whatnot good stuff may origin may

1095
01:55:11.40 --> 01:55:16.44
murder me in America may in America yeah which is good on a whole bunch of different levels

1096
01:55:16.44 --> 01:55:25.08
also we got a bunch of supplements we got joint warfare we got krill oil we got discipline which is

1097
01:55:25.08 --> 01:55:36.36
good to drink before you get after it mentally or physically and also we got milk yeah

1098
01:55:36.36 --> 01:55:42.60
but back to joint warfare okay so let me get the pit I know you you're wondering how my arm is doing

1099
01:55:42.60 --> 01:55:49.72
you're not I know man oh let you know so I went to Oregon the Oregon coast last week one week

1100
01:55:49.72 --> 01:55:57.48
forgot the joint warfare I just had surgery on my bicep about six yeah six weeks ago and you know

1101
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:02.76
woo you you know I would have fed extra some broth I know but yeah and thank you but you know

1102
01:56:02.76 --> 01:56:06.92
I didn't see how long ago to take before you noticed it I'm guessing the moral of the story

1103
01:56:06.92 --> 01:56:11.48
is this didn't work out yeah so and here's the thing my surgeon is good he was good he did a good

1104
01:56:11.48 --> 01:56:16.52
job on my arm reattached my bicep tendon to my bone drill the hole in the bone

1105
01:56:16.52 --> 01:56:24.04
bones to get through so it up good good good shot so I take joint warfare the thing feels good like

1106
01:56:24.04 --> 01:56:28.04
I'm way ahead of schedule you know surprisingly because I had it done in my other 99 years ago

1107
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:34.36
about so it's all good I'm moving around doing like pushups doing stuff that no way I could

1108
01:56:34.36 --> 01:56:38.92
I could have done with my other arm last time so I got it Oregon coast forget the joint warfare

1109
01:56:38.92 --> 01:56:43.24
I attributed to the joint warfare how far ahead I am so I forget the joint warfare I'm in the

1110
01:56:43.24 --> 01:56:48.84
Oregon coast I would say about two days and here's the thing in start like hurting or going

1111
01:56:48.84 --> 01:56:54.04
backwards and I think that but it was just this weird stiffness that sort of just like I couldn't

1112
01:56:54.04 --> 01:56:58.20
straighten it out right away when I wake up you know I can't like you know I kind of got to work

1113
01:56:58.20 --> 01:57:02.92
it out and it slowly just started to just stiffen up a little more and here's the thing I was

1114
01:57:02.92 --> 01:57:08.28
way less active on it too where because when I do like pushups and stuff where I'm using my elbow

1115
01:57:08.28 --> 01:57:13.000
a lot it would be kind of stiff that night you know than the next thing you do stuff and then it's

1116
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.80
stronger you know it's just one of the same like muscles but it's in my try so I was doing that

1117
01:57:17.80 --> 01:57:26.84
not much activity and it was just general stiffness yeah bro I don't want to say it felt inflamed

1118
01:57:26.84 --> 01:57:32.36
but it felt like you know you know like you spraying your thumb or something like that and it's like

1119
01:57:32.36 --> 01:57:38.20
swollen and it's like just jammed up you can use it but anyway it kind of felt like that

1120
01:57:38.20 --> 01:57:45.08
functional but not optimal functional but not optimal and then I come back two days back

1121
01:57:45.08 --> 01:57:49.64
from the joint warfare boom back in the game that's full on back in the game that's pretty cool

1122
01:57:49.64 --> 01:57:54.92
and it's for her for hell of a thing man it's supposed to mean could straighten

1123
01:57:54.92 --> 01:58:00.28
curcumin good for you bring to by the way yeah just like discipline yeah also milk as you were

1124
01:58:00.28 --> 01:58:06.12
sane what up with milk well there's first one milk's awesome second of all what is milk

1125
01:58:06.12 --> 01:58:10.20
it's milk everyone knows that now I think that's pretty much gonna be the new thing

1126
01:58:11.48 --> 01:58:17.40
and we have peanut butter chocolate will be coming out I want to say it a week

1127
01:58:17.40 --> 01:58:22.68
I want to say it within a week you're all like yeah we have peanut butter and chuck we have

1128
01:58:22.68 --> 01:58:28.12
peanut butter and chocolate coming in a butter week yeah maybe no no it's not even a

1129
01:58:28.12 --> 01:58:32.92
maybe it's straight up one week counting down the day okay that's good so milk protein how

1130
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:39.24
much you're having a protein amount you know 22 so and I heard this I recently read

1131
01:58:39.24 --> 01:58:43.000
actually I didn't read it I saw it on a video YouTube video I know that sounds like

1132
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:52.44
or YouTube video but I think this one had credibility so so you need that need but a good

1133
01:58:52.44 --> 01:58:57.32
amount of protein is one gram they thought it was like one point five we were trying to build

1134
01:58:57.32 --> 01:59:01.16
muscle on this stuff but it's changed it's about yeah it's way the according to this youtube

1135
01:59:01.16 --> 01:59:07.40
video right in the video it's like 0.7 or something like this 0.7 I don't know

1136
01:59:07.40 --> 01:59:13.24
I need more in that yeah well there you go milk get it and it tastes good real good

1137
01:59:13.24 --> 01:59:18.68
by the way it's dessert yeah any was a small classified as a dessert that's the question

1138
01:59:18.68 --> 01:59:24.04
yeah it's currently it's currently that's how I classify too it would have to be literally

1139
01:59:24.04 --> 01:59:26.20
eat my dinner and then I'm all excited you have more

1140
01:59:26.20 --> 01:59:32.28
you know it's a dessert it is a dessert and what I would on a trip and I haven't figured

1141
01:59:32.28 --> 01:59:36.68
out how to travel with milk yet which is a real bummer but you know it's it's scoop you can't

1142
01:59:36.68 --> 01:59:42.04
bring six scoops and I'm real light traveler yeah and so now when I go somewhere

1143
01:59:42.92 --> 01:59:48.04
and I get whatever I get a good meal I'll get a legit meal but I want to dessert yeah I want

1144
01:59:48.04 --> 01:59:56.20
milk does that you do you put it in a zip lock bag yeah puff not in your carry on by the way

1145
01:59:56.20 --> 02:00:01.40
then you got to bring a shaker right there's this multiple problems that I have I have

1146
02:00:01.40 --> 02:00:05.96
got to figure it out figure out a sister figure it out one thing I can say is two is when I

1147
02:00:05.96 --> 02:00:13.000
when I always if I drink protein shakes in the past I would have to use a big shaker

1148
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:20.28
um and put a lot put price 16 ounces of milk oh my goodness forever one thing that's good

1149
02:00:20.28 --> 02:00:23.88
about milk and because that's the only way to feel satisfied with milk you can use one of the

1150
02:00:23.88 --> 02:00:28.44
small little shakers so this is the possibility I'm creating ideas right now I can bring one of

1151
02:00:28.44 --> 02:00:32.68
the small shakers bring a little bit of milk in it and then just hit it up it would be good yeah

1152
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:35.80
because you don't need a big giant shaker because you don't need to drink that much milk to feel like

1153
02:00:36.84 --> 02:00:41.000
like like you got enough dessert like you got enough dessert yeah

1154
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.60
anyway back to the deal uh emerging camp yeah winter jackets coming August 26th

1155
02:00:48.60 --> 02:00:54.36
August 26th through September 2nd this is weird but we might it looks like we might actually

1156
02:00:55.08 --> 02:00:59.80
sell out like have a certain point how do you sell out of the camp they didn't think we'd be

1157
02:00:59.80 --> 02:01:04.36
but we so if you want to come get registered because it we're probably gonna end up

1158
02:01:05.08 --> 02:01:09.80
because you can only we we have we we're we are about more mats double the mats that we had the

1159
02:01:09.80 --> 02:01:17.96
muster yeah it's a lot of mats but still I mean they're still a limit so if you want to come to that

1160
02:01:18.76 --> 02:01:24.36
come I'll be there echo will be there Dave Burke will be there latefabble will be there jp's on the fence

1161
02:01:25.64 --> 02:01:33.48
Dean Lister Dean Lister will be there sure yeah and that's good and where you know when you

1162
02:01:33.48 --> 02:01:37.32
learn stuff at the I mean there's they're you know there's they're you're gonna learn

1163
02:01:37.32 --> 02:01:44.04
specific things from specific people and all that stuff but don't look at it like this thing

1164
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:48.04
where you're gonna go and you're just gonna learn what they have to teach you you know they're gonna

1165
02:01:48.04 --> 02:01:55.88
teach you um flighters like the 15 or 20 black belt sir yes so on top of that if you made it

1166
02:01:55.88 --> 02:02:00.28
your goal if you went and you went and you said went to each one of those 15 black belts and said

1167
02:02:00.28 --> 02:02:08.44
show me your your best move yeah if you did that and you walked away that would be that would be solid

1168
02:02:08.44 --> 02:02:13.32
yeah but you you couldn't this isn't this isn't a hey show me your move and you spend three minutes

1169
02:02:13.32 --> 02:02:19.40
now I'm talking if you if you spent like an hour maybe even an hour and a half going over what's

1170
02:02:19.40 --> 02:02:28.76
your best move like I bet I could teach certain moves for an hour and a half and just show

1171
02:02:28.76 --> 02:02:33.32
every little detail if you came to the immersion camp and that's what you did you be rocking out

1172
02:02:33.32 --> 02:02:38.76
of their solid it'd be it'd be rough if everyone did that because you know it'd be hard

1173
02:02:38.76 --> 02:02:45.16
yeah I don't think you could logistically do it but I will say this that on top of what all the

1174
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:51.24
instructors there and not to mention just other experienced people what they have to offer and teach you

1175
02:02:51.24 --> 02:03:00.28
you can come and be like hey my rear naked choke needs work yeah this is how I do it a juggle

1176
02:03:00.28 --> 02:03:05.64
come here this is how I do it this is all day by the way you the other subject this is how I do it

1177
02:03:05.64 --> 02:03:10.44
and show well that's that's one thing that you could do because you can't just literally train

1178
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:16.44
the entire time but you can get shown moves and you can work moves oh yeah you can't just

1179
02:03:16.44 --> 02:03:24.28
train because you'll die well yes you'll die for sure but if but the point is there though where

1180
02:03:24.28 --> 02:03:28.68
you can come and you can come to immersion camp right and it's good again to learn from from

1181
02:03:28.68 --> 02:03:34.44
everything that everyone has to teach but you can go in with specific like questions with your

1182
02:03:34.44 --> 02:03:38.04
game where you still like oh for sure how am I going to get better of course my Jesus is going to get

1183
02:03:38.04 --> 02:03:44.20
better in general that's good of course but if it's like wait will my mouth if you get better

1184
02:03:44.20 --> 02:03:48.76
your mouth escapes get better and that's what you focus on and you can ask actually while I'll give

1185
02:03:48.76 --> 02:03:55.000
you this advice if you have trouble being mounted and escaping the mouth a good person to ask about

1186
02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.04
that is actually echo Charles you have a very good uh mouth escape oh yes very teachable to that's

1187
02:04:00.04 --> 02:04:06.12
one of your best moves is the mouth escape I will say that right now a foritatively right off got a good

1188
02:04:06.12 --> 02:04:14.36
non escape thanks for also shifting gears so yeah anyway but yeah immersion camp August 26 to September

1213
02:06:39.48 --> 02:06:44.92
the podcast is to subscribe to the podcast what I tunes in google play stitcher wherever you listen

1214
02:06:44.92 --> 02:06:50.92
to to podcasts interesting all this so many of them out there now there's a lot of podcasts

1215
02:06:50.92 --> 02:06:57.08
no platform sorry yeah a lot of podcasts and there's a lot of podcasts platforms yes it's the new media

1216
02:06:57.08 --> 02:07:04.92
it's the new media the new media voice yeah it is voice it is voice also in addition to this podcast

1217
02:07:06.28 --> 02:07:15.32
which is called the jacco podcast there's also the warrior kid podcast which is 4 kids but

1218
02:07:15.32 --> 02:07:20.76
I promise you can get a lot out of it as an adult too cool thing I've been doing on that I've done it twice

1219
02:07:20.76 --> 02:07:27.08
I'm gonna do it more but so it's questions for uncle jaccoz the basic premises premise of it

1220
02:07:27.08 --> 02:07:32.76
but now I have stories from uncle jaccoz and the stories from uncle jaccoz actually from uncle jaccoz

1221
02:07:32.76 --> 02:07:41.64
childhood and they kind of teach a lesson to people yeah so that's number podcast number 14

1222
02:07:41.64 --> 02:07:47.72
and 15 or the first two that I've started doing stories from uncle jaccoz so I think people will like those

1223
02:07:49.08 --> 02:07:54.92
they're a little bit of yeah they're good some so this kind of like character development

1224
02:07:54.92 --> 02:08:01.40
sprinkled in there with less the to me the less it wasn't I'm maybe this is intentional but the

1225
02:08:01.40 --> 02:08:08.92
lesson is the primary thing of course and it's deep sim very consistent with the whole uncle jaccoz

1226
02:08:08.92 --> 02:08:19.96
so the idea is I'm explaining how uncle jaccoz got his values from experiences that he went

1227
02:08:19.96 --> 02:08:26.20
through as a child and their stories are five minutes eight minutes something like that they're

1228
02:08:26.20 --> 02:08:32.60
they're pretty short stories but they're cool and they're enjoyable so warrior kid podcast you can

1229
02:08:32.60 --> 02:08:39.88
check that one out it's it's good and if kids if your kids have questions from uncle jaccoz

1231
02:08:47.24 --> 02:08:51.56
also youtube subscribe to the youtube channel we do have a youtube channel if you're interested in the

1232
02:08:51.56 --> 02:08:57.88
video version of this podcast or if you want to see echoes editing skills sure some people say you

1233
02:08:57.88 --> 02:09:03.56
went over the top sure oh go up on top something so you there's a video called warpath it's it's

1234
02:09:03.56 --> 02:09:08.52
probably the most controversial video from my perspective because it was originated with Christmas music

1235
02:09:08.52 --> 02:09:13.32
which I don't like Christmas music and echo made with Christmas music and he put a lot of time

1236
02:09:13.32 --> 02:09:18.28
and effort into it on Christmas so if we want to talk leadership here like from my perspective I

1237
02:09:18.28 --> 02:09:22.28
knew you'd been working really hard on this thing and then you showed it to me and then the Christmas

1238
02:09:22.28 --> 02:09:28.04
music kicked in which I didn't like didn't match but you know I just had to be like hey man it's great

1239
02:09:28.04 --> 02:09:35.000
I really appreciate it oh it's a great video so I lied to you is that a lie you didn't say great no you

1240
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:44.36
did not lie okay said and I quote interesting choice of music for this that's it now I also will say

1241
02:09:44.36 --> 02:09:51.24
that I don't 100% trust myself like I think to myself well echo really liked Christmas music so

1242
02:09:51.24 --> 02:09:55.80
he put it in there so that's fine if that maybe some other people will like it too and that's

1243
02:09:55.80 --> 02:10:00.20
I'm not here to like dictate what people like and don't like I'm just here to tell you what I like and don't

1244
02:10:00.20 --> 02:10:07.32
like yes but then you but then you read it the video with with more appropriate music sure

1245
02:10:07.32 --> 02:10:14.76
which is good but but then some people said you got crazy you went too far with the you went to

1246
02:10:14.76 --> 02:10:18.84
for you too much stuff exploded you got too much stuff going on there's the same amount of

1247
02:10:18.84 --> 02:10:23.16
exclusion I never would have said I never really paid too much attention about people said because I

1248
02:10:23.16 --> 02:10:27.64
couldn't even get past the music once I got past the music and I checked that YouTube comments

1249
02:10:28.92 --> 02:10:35.08
which I know right yeah you know I went there and people some people the majority of people

1250
02:10:36.04 --> 02:10:43.72
said amazing right the majority some people just threw it out there hey take it easy bro yeah you can't

1251
02:10:43.72 --> 02:10:50.28
make that you can't you cross the line right yes you went over like I think you were around the line

1252
02:10:51.64 --> 02:10:59.000
I think you might have you know step the toll over it but but we have to find out where the

1253
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.24
line is right yes and I think you did a good job of pressing up a good line without just kidding

1254
02:11:03.24 --> 02:11:08.60
well let me let me tell you the philosophy and tell me if this is a good way to approach it

1255
02:11:08.60 --> 02:11:15.24
so a lot of those videos just okay so consider the first one we did good right it's a good first one

1256
02:11:15.24 --> 02:11:22.76
you did okay good all about the game I think I might have told the story like there's a story behind

1257
02:11:22.76 --> 02:11:28.52
but we're recording podcast it's like number three or five one of the first initial ones and I was like

1258
02:11:28.52 --> 02:11:34.92
oh my camera was sitting over there behind kind of behind over in the corner and if you notice on

1259
02:11:34.92 --> 02:11:40.12
good when it shows you you can see like it's behind like a monitor and see you can see this stuff I

1260
02:11:40.12 --> 02:11:44.76
just went and pressed I kind of moved the camera a little bit and I just pressed record before you

1261
02:11:44.76 --> 02:11:49.80
said that that part and I was like oh I'm gonna record this just in case I'll make a video a lot of it

1262
02:11:49.80 --> 02:11:56.44
or something or whatever and if you look at I watch it the other day we're like Joe Rogan as we're talking

1263
02:11:56.44 --> 02:12:01.000
about it so I was like oh let me watch it you know and I remember thinking and you're like reading

1264
02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:07.96
and when you're looking up like you're looking at me and I remember you uh design this stuff

1265
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:14.20
to me and I'm like five this is crazy I'm glad I'm recording it but that wasn't made it wasn't like

1266
02:12:14.20 --> 02:12:17.16
okay we're gonna do this we're gonna record this and we're gonna do that you know it's just like

1267
02:12:17.16 --> 02:12:23.48
I'm gonna try to make a fun video out of it and then just put some random like graphics on there

1268
02:12:23.48 --> 02:12:28.68
that was just having fun doing so these videos you do it they're kind of done out of just fun you know

1269
02:12:28.68 --> 02:12:34.84
and everyone's gonna say oh hey man you have too much fun you grab some sound effects you make the

1270
02:12:34.84 --> 02:12:39.96
walls combo you do kind of stuff you know you have some fun with it I mean there's no I guess

1271
02:12:39.96 --> 02:12:45.08
there is kind of they're thematic I guess right there's some theme to it like warpath like yeah

1272
02:12:45.08 --> 02:12:50.84
it's kind of for me it's like it's it's pretty awesome to watch yeah it's just and I could see where

1273
02:12:50.84 --> 02:12:55.32
you're like you I can see where you start going down the path of like just more as better

1274
02:12:55.32 --> 02:13:01.80
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's really what happens and I'll catch myself doing

1275
02:13:01.80 --> 02:13:06.44
and it'll take along as I don't know like brother it's not even necessary and in fact and some

1276
02:13:06.44 --> 02:13:11.000
people they will bring up this point which is a good point where I put stuff commonly right for

1277
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.52
okay warpath or take warpath for example I put the walls crumbling in Jacoen Dean rolling

1278
02:13:16.52 --> 02:13:21.48
and when they when they clash like the walls come chattering down it's all these special effects

1279
02:13:21.48 --> 02:13:26.04
which is like cool when you look at but all the special effects the sound effects and like all

1280
02:13:26.04 --> 02:13:31.08
this stuff is like is it kind of getting in the way of the message because the message is like you're

1281
02:13:31.08 --> 02:13:35.88
saying something specific you know so it's kind of getting in the way you know so I got to watch

1282
02:13:35.88 --> 02:13:39.96
up for that yeah and I think that's a good point when people say that I'm like saying that's true

1283
02:13:39.96 --> 02:13:46.12
and because you know when you're in the middle of the whole stuff yeah I guess but yeah I've got

1284
02:13:46.12 --> 02:13:52.84
to watch out there's also a warrior kid youtube channel okay so the reason that we separated

1285
02:13:52.84 --> 02:13:59.56
the warrior kid and the warrior kid and the Jaco podcast channel channel blah blah blah is because

1286
02:14:00.28 --> 02:14:05.72
we know that there's things on this podcast and on the therefore on the youtube channel Jaco podcast

1287
02:14:05.72 --> 02:14:11.64
there's stuff that's inappropriate for children to listen to or watch and so this is a way to

1288
02:14:11.64 --> 02:14:16.76
separate them so there's also a warrior kid youtube channel that your kid can sit there and watch and

1289
02:14:16.76 --> 02:14:22.04
and hopefully I'm not guaranteed because I don't know how the algorithms work that pop up the next

1290
02:14:22.04 --> 02:14:29.08
video selections but hopefully your kid can watch the warrior kid videos without getting hooked into

1291
02:14:29.08 --> 02:14:36.60
the unit 731 test mode about the intersection so watch out for that yeah true story and

1292
02:14:36.60 --> 02:14:46.12
that ones in color too by the way yeah also good way to separate yourself is to get some new gear

1293
02:14:46.84 --> 02:14:52.44
if you work out to boring give me new gear from on it by the way on it dot com slash jockel

1294
02:14:52.44 --> 02:14:58.36
good place to go good information too about starting your kettlebell workout browser and I just thought

1295
02:14:58.36 --> 02:15:05.64
this is yesterday was in the pool with my daughter and my wife was saying you know you know

1296
02:15:05.64 --> 02:15:10.04
like okay so you might seem like bj pen do this where he'll go in the bottom of the ocean

1297
02:15:10.04 --> 02:15:15.24
and he's asking that right now yeah yeah that's so so I'm like hey you could grab one of those

1298
02:15:15.24 --> 02:15:21.000
kettlebell for sure and and my daughter she's five so she's like yeah I'll grab the little it's like

1299
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:27.72
it's like a pixie no or I don't know what it is but it's like one of those legend bells yeah

1300
02:15:27.72 --> 02:15:32.20
it's a small one that I got for so she grabs it and she goes in the pool she's like I'm

1301
02:15:32.20 --> 02:15:36.44
gonna say yeah I walked to the other side and it's like deep it's she goes kind into the deep

1302
02:15:36.44 --> 02:15:41.80
section so she goes and she's carrying it she's doing the whole bj pen with the little kettlebell

1303
02:15:41.80 --> 02:15:46.04
she's five by the way under the water and we're watching it we're like oh that's cute but she

1304
02:15:46.04 --> 02:15:50.84
starts to sort of run out of air and she don't want to drop the kettlebell because it's like going to slam

1305
02:15:50.84 --> 02:15:54.60
in the bottom of the pool and I don't know maybe she just she's five she didn't think of that you know

1306
02:15:54.60 --> 02:15:58.52
kind of thing so I see her trying to like swim with it like trying to get to the top and it's kind

1307
02:15:58.52 --> 02:16:02.44
of deep and it's like always started to get worried and then she started a little bit more urgency

1308
02:16:02.44 --> 02:16:07.72
so I had to jump in grab her echo with the save save but she did right when I got towards

1309
02:16:07.72 --> 02:16:11.56
she put it up on the little there's a little ledge on the other side of the pool there she managed

1310
02:16:11.56 --> 02:16:18.36
to do it just but just barely so I went in there with my middle daughter was probably

1311
02:16:19.24 --> 02:16:25.08
eight eight years old and we had a party at the beach for our birthday or what it

1312
02:16:27.08 --> 02:16:30.28
and so I was dealing with like as long as I could I was dealing with the games and the

1313
02:16:30.28 --> 02:16:35.48
whatever and finally I'm like you know what that's it we're going we're gonna get some so we formed

1314
02:16:35.48 --> 02:16:39.72
the party up into two teams and we're gonna compete against each other in obstacle courses and

1315
02:16:39.72 --> 02:16:47.000
sprints and all this other stuff and this particular location has a river gentle flowing

1316
02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:54.20
title river that comes out and anyways one of the contests I had was okay you just we got a swim

1317
02:16:54.20 --> 02:16:58.52
across and there's big rocks and stuff and I go you got a swim across the river and come back

1318
02:16:58.52 --> 02:17:06.28
and whoever brings back the biggest rock is the winner so my middle daughter is top top she's top

1319
02:17:06.28 --> 02:17:13.48
and she's strong she's a wrestler and gymnastics and all that crap and we're not crap

1320
02:17:13.48 --> 02:17:20.60
but all that stuff you know that she's just she's a beast and she's mentally like um I don't

1321
02:17:20.60 --> 02:17:26.12
want to use the term psycho but like she's real determined about stuff so anyways this is where

1322
02:17:26.12 --> 02:17:33.96
she's a little kid you know and so go across the river and whoever brings back the biggest rock

1323
02:17:33.96 --> 02:17:40.68
wins so she goes so they all go across and kids are grabbing rocks that are size of let's say

1324
02:17:40.68 --> 02:17:47.72
let's say a softball you know maybe a softball what's in between the size of a softball and a soccer ball

1325
02:17:49.56 --> 02:17:57.08
uh I don't know so so something okay low for bread like like maybe a small low for bread

1326
02:17:57.08 --> 02:18:03.08
that's the max right that any of these kids are grabbing my daughter grab something that's like the

1327
02:18:03.08 --> 02:18:11.72
size of a like a legit watermelon like a big giant giant giant rock a two hand oh two hand rock

1328
02:18:11.72 --> 02:18:18.12
rub giant rock like four or five loaves of bread just a big big giant rock and and I'm watching

1329
02:18:18.12 --> 02:18:20.92
and I'm thinking she's just gonna sink to the bottom and so I have to let it go and so I have to go

1330
02:18:20.92 --> 02:18:26.76
back and get a smaller one maybe she can still do okay so she's come and the river has weird

1331
02:18:26.76 --> 02:18:30.36
contours on the bottom you know you're you're you can walk a little while and then it just drop

1332
02:18:30.36 --> 02:18:38.60
super deep and you've got to make it yeah so I'm watching her and she's she's just hard for even

1333
02:18:38.60 --> 02:18:45.64
carry it and she carries he gets that deep section just drops down goes under and I'm waiting for

1334
02:18:45.64 --> 02:18:51.24
to pop up but she doesn't pop up and I'm waiting for the pop up and she doesn't pop up and I'm waiting

1335
02:18:51.24 --> 02:18:55.80
for the pop up and she doesn't pop up and then I see like an air bubble come up and I'm like

1336
02:18:55.80 --> 02:19:02.36
oh damn but the air bubble is progressed so now watching the air bubbles like progress

1337
02:19:02.36 --> 02:19:09.48
they're coming closer to the other side and and then it starts to come up and sure enough

1338
02:19:09.48 --> 02:19:15.48
out she comes like a like a beast she's going to hold the rock and she comes about the water

1339
02:19:15.48 --> 02:19:21.64
aww how we do it powered through that and brings the rock up drops it at my feet

1340
02:19:21.64 --> 02:19:27.16
now it's like victory is yours that's that's actually pretty powerful because

1341
02:19:27.16 --> 02:19:32.60
bro when you're I mean unless she was like defense under mindset so her she was probably like

1342
02:19:33.96 --> 02:19:38.04
I'm not gonna let this rock defeat me I'm gonna bring it to the other side and that's kind of the mindset

1343
02:19:38.76 --> 02:19:44.92
I'm not gonna drop it for that reason I think my daughter did was like I'm can't drop this thing

1344
02:19:44.92 --> 02:19:49.80
so I'm stuck with it you know kind of thing that's what you know so she started you could tell she was

1345
02:19:49.80 --> 02:19:54.68
little bit going into panic mode yeah yeah so it's the whole difference scenario technically

1346
02:19:54.68 --> 02:20:00.76
but that's pretty savage though do you think that I should because she's probably she's scared she even said

1347
02:20:00.76 --> 02:20:04.60
like later like oh that was like scary and all this stuff I should probably make her do it again

1348
02:20:04.60 --> 02:20:10.52
huh yeah yeah like not make her like do it but maybe jump in with her my daughter my

1349
02:20:10.52 --> 02:20:15.88
youngest daughter just did a big cliff jump yesterday and long swim in the ocean open open ocean waters

1350
02:20:15.88 --> 02:20:20.28
you know you gotta get them and she was I was I thought she was gonna be panicky

1351
02:20:20.28 --> 02:20:24.92
yeah because it's a big drop and it's ocean in whatever and it's a way of action

1352
02:20:24.92 --> 02:20:27.96
but she was I said you good and she said yeah

1353
02:20:27.96 --> 02:20:33.64
do you do it too yeah yeah yeah that you know unless you got traumatized by it or something like this

1354
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:39.24
yeah where bro Mike it's weird come from Hawaii jump off everything yeah no water go

1355
02:20:39.24 --> 02:20:46.28
on that's right yeah you see you know what that so we have this ledge you know that you know you saw it

1356
02:20:46.28 --> 02:20:51.80
and it's not that high but for a one year old it's pretty high pretty good but my boy and my

1357
02:20:51.80 --> 02:20:59.48
daughter when she's one two they just jump off we catch them they can swim you know and my son

1358
02:20:59.48 --> 02:21:04.68
he jumped off a few times and was all good but then one time he went to walk and there is this

1359
02:21:04.68 --> 02:21:09.80
little just a slight little dip and you know when you're you know you're new to walk he slipped he

1360
02:21:09.80 --> 02:21:15.48
tripped and he fell in I caught him but he flew on like hey decide on the edge of the thing and he's

1361
02:21:15.48 --> 02:21:20.04
getting his crying he's won and just just over one maybe like you're making a minimum do it again

1362
02:21:20.04 --> 02:21:25.32
he didn't want to do it though but so I didn't like push him again I just kept like hey do it I

1363
02:21:25.32 --> 02:21:29.96
got you I got you and you'd be like you know crying in whatever and then you know my daughter would

1364
02:21:29.96 --> 02:21:35.24
do it I would do it they need to find me like reluctantly did it and we cheered for him and now he's all good

1365
02:21:35.24 --> 02:21:41.88
good to go like forces himself he makes me catch him now he's like almost two anyway but yeah the

1366
02:21:41.88 --> 02:21:47.32
the point is you make him do it again right yeah but you're very accurate and saying don't traumatism

1367
02:21:47.32 --> 02:21:51.56
yeah like you're going right now okay you'll walk him off now it's just getting worse you're not you're not

1368
02:21:51.56 --> 02:21:56.60
yeah you know it's like the hey do it you should do it oh you want to take a little break that's okay

1369
02:21:56.60 --> 02:22:00.44
but you know you should definitely do this it's you've already done it before you don't want to

1370
02:22:00.44 --> 02:22:05.64
traumatize them worse yeah yeah that's not gonna work out good yeah especially with the waterman

1371
02:22:05.64 --> 02:22:10.92
because it's like it's one minute it's all fun and games and literally your mind can flip you know

1372
02:22:10.92 --> 02:22:16.76
like I'm about to die I used to say this so in the 90s in the seal teams when there was no

1373
02:22:16.76 --> 02:22:23.80
war going on and whatever you're to go out and you do training there was times I would always tell

1374
02:22:23.80 --> 02:22:28.68
guys when you're working in the water it's a real world mission like we didn't know what a real

1375
02:22:28.68 --> 02:22:32.92
world mission got never been on one but the the fact of the matter is when you're working with

1376
02:22:32.92 --> 02:22:37.16
the water it's a real world mission because if you screw something up you can easily die

1377
02:22:37.16 --> 02:22:41.16
yeah easily if you're not careful one up one down just gonna throw it out there if you're doing

1378
02:22:41.16 --> 02:22:45.40
any kind of this training any training the water one person stays up on the surface the other

1379
02:22:45.40 --> 02:22:51.40
person you know and be a lifeguard you don't do simultaneous training in the water so just throwing

1380
02:22:51.40 --> 02:22:56.44
that out there's a little safety note for everyone one up on down that's the rule yes and especially

1381
02:22:56.44 --> 02:23:02.52
if you're carrying the kettlebells from on it or otherwise if the bottom of the pool the bottom of the

1382
02:23:02.52 --> 02:23:10.04
ocean bottom of a reservoir bottom of anybody of water yeah one up one down one up one down

1383
02:23:10.04 --> 02:23:15.32
is the rule nonetheless so that's how we utilize the pixie I think it's called pixie it's one of

1384
02:23:15.32 --> 02:23:21.56
legend bells anyway if I guess that doesn't really have much to do with what on it offers but it

1385
02:23:21.56 --> 02:23:27.000
just I just thought of that could just happen okay he was represented in the story boom

1386
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.32
indeed but anyway if you want cool a thin enough on it dot com slash jacco a lot of good

1387
02:23:31.32 --> 02:23:37.08
information on there some socks on there I mentioned the socks like it's like this big deal and

1388
02:23:37.08 --> 02:23:43.80
here's the thing it is on it socks of the TSA the other day I just stunt on it on it socks

1389
02:23:43.80 --> 02:23:48.28
you know they're looking they're like do the dope socks anyway on it dot com slash jacco is

1390
02:23:48.28 --> 02:23:53.24
the good spot psychological warfare is an album that you can get where I talk about stuff

1391
02:23:53.24 --> 02:23:58.12
just overcoming when you have a little moments of weakness and I'm gonna make another one

1392
02:23:58.12 --> 02:24:02.60
good and make another one got it got me plotting on it good it looks like it's gonna be called

1393
02:24:02.60 --> 02:24:09.000
all your excuses are lies yes good I could take a lot you get that what I do in school play

1394
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:15.64
whatever MP3's are so old yeah man that was on and also jacco white tea

1395
02:24:16.60 --> 02:24:20.92
people now seeing that we have cans of jacco white tea where do you get them you get them on

1396
02:24:20.92 --> 02:24:26.52
Amazon if you want them it tastes awesome you can get the dry tea on there too which you add

1397
02:24:26.52 --> 02:24:32.84
water to and then you brew it and then if either one you're gonna get a 8000 pound dead lift

1398
02:24:32.84 --> 02:24:36.84
so that's cool do that got some books way the warrior kid

1399
02:24:36.84 --> 02:24:45.48
and mark submission two books which one do you like better do I like better uh can't say

1400
02:24:45.48 --> 02:24:50.92
because the first one the OG the original one from wimpy to warrior will always have

1401
02:24:51.56 --> 02:24:58.04
that's the one that establishes establishes the ethos in my house anyway um but yeah no

1402
02:24:58.04 --> 02:25:04.84
I can't say I think they're both outstanding but it's good how you evolve the issues you know

1403
02:25:04.84 --> 02:25:08.84
like it's like boom basically think about how many people like all you're gonna write more

1404
02:25:08.84 --> 02:25:12.44
well yeah what are you gonna write about think about all the issues you have as a human being

1405
02:25:12.44 --> 02:25:15.80
and then think about all the issues you had as a kid yeah like we're gonna cover all those yeah

1406
02:25:15.80 --> 02:25:20.20
that's like 10 books right google jacco has helped for you yeah so yeah way the warrior kid books

1407
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:26.76
the one thing that's cool is people as a parent you're like man how do I get my kid to

1408
02:25:26.76 --> 02:25:30.68
even something as stupid as cleaning your room right how do you get your kid to clean your room

1409
02:25:30.68 --> 02:25:37.000
how many this book I got pictures I got I got pictures on Twitter the other day kids got a vacuum cleaner

1410
02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.92
at the dad's a pump right yeah that's a pump he's like oh look at this I don't think that's a real thing

1411
02:25:42.92 --> 02:25:49.32
even as um like okay so kids read the book of course but I read it to my daughter who is

1412
02:25:49.32 --> 02:25:54.52
for at the time for yeah so I'm reading it and it's answering a bunch of questions I have

1413
02:25:55.08 --> 02:25:59.48
so it's like hey you know my kid you know my daughter's like okay okay oh he means parenting

1414
02:25:59.48 --> 02:26:03.96
course yeah exactly right so and it's just little stuff little stuff sometimes you won't even

1415
02:26:03.96 --> 02:26:08.04
really think up so like okay for example and I said I mentioned this before but it's a huge deal

1416
02:26:08.04 --> 02:26:12.52
that I still use it like it's not a front of my mind every single time so you know how like you

1417
02:26:12.52 --> 02:26:16.68
have a kid and they'll be like real good at something just kind of right away maybe your kid's

1418
02:26:16.68 --> 02:26:21.000
more athletic or something maybe they're bigger taller whatever so they kind of win real quick you know

1419
02:26:22.04 --> 02:26:27.48
so when they run into a situation where they're in an activity that actually requires practice

1420
02:26:27.48 --> 02:26:33.16
like a cartwheel or something like this and so my daughter she's big she's athletic little girl

1421
02:26:34.28 --> 02:26:38.76
way bigger she's you know and so she has this friend same age she's like a week

1422
02:26:38.76 --> 02:26:42.76
either older a young guy forget but they're the same age and she can do a cartwheel and just

1423
02:26:42.76 --> 02:26:47.24
fly through cartwheels one handed cartwheels all this stuff this other girl can she's way smaller

1424
02:26:47.80 --> 02:26:53.08
you know way whatever so my daughter she doesn't like that not the fact that the girl can but just

1425
02:26:53.08 --> 02:27:00.52
she can you know so she tries to do it and it's kind of like yeah you know it's a whole thing

1426
02:27:00.52 --> 02:27:08.36
so it's it's very upsetting so Uncle Jake said something in the first one that this will always

1427
02:27:08.36 --> 02:27:12.12
stick with you once she complains to me about it can't do a cartwheel and how much you can do a

1428
02:27:12.12 --> 02:27:18.84
cartwheel but I can and all this stuff I say and that quote how do you expect to be good at

1429
02:27:18.84 --> 02:27:23.48
something when you've never practiced the bone just like the times table yeah I can be good at times

1430
02:27:23.48 --> 02:27:28.92
if we'll never study you know and you know how to do a cartwheel you're not foreign no

1431
02:27:28.92 --> 02:27:33.16
not a do a cartwheel just like how you know our other neighbor can play the guitar you know

1432
02:27:33.16 --> 02:27:37.56
much practice you know kind of thing and it's crazy because just that simple line right there

1433
02:27:37.56 --> 02:27:41.96
like to choose for and she understands you know she's like practicing but anyway that's how

1434
02:27:41.96 --> 02:27:46.44
that's how that book is man warrior kid books there's two of them where the warrior kid and
