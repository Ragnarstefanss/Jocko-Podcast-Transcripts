00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.72
This is Jockel podcast number 274 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I

2
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:14.52
go. Good evening. All right. So the last podcast, 273 we were with Anthony Herbert, Tony Herbert,

3
00:00:14.52 --> 00:00:22.24
also known as and we started off his journey from a kid growing up in Pennsylvania. So if you

4
00:00:22.24 --> 00:00:28.80
haven't listened to podcast 273, go listen to that right now. He tried to join the Marines at

5
00:00:28.80 --> 00:00:37.36
2014, 14 years old credit. Eventually doing the Army at 17, off to the Korean War, went from

6
00:00:37.36 --> 00:00:45.96
private to master sergeant, all kinds of heroic actions, suffered all kinds of wounds, shot, hit

7
00:00:45.96 --> 00:00:53.68
with frag, white phosphorus burns, and also bayoneted multiple times, including one bayonet

8
00:00:53.68 --> 00:01:03.04
stab that broke off in his chest. He in the Korean War served as a platoon leader, even

9
00:01:03.04 --> 00:01:09.64
though he was just a young and listed guy, and eventually at the end of that podcast and at

10
00:01:09.64 --> 00:01:13.96
the end of that part of his life, he was pulled off the battlefield, one of the most decorated

11
00:01:13.96 --> 00:01:21.16
soldiers of the war sent on a marat. It was basically a maral tour. And first we got flown back

12
00:01:21.16 --> 00:01:27.96
to the White House, met President Truman. And then basically went to London and Antwerp and Brussels

13
00:01:27.96 --> 00:01:34.20
and the Hague and all the other European allies that were fighting alongside America in the Korean War.

14
00:01:34.20 --> 00:01:41.80
Along the way, he met Mrs. Elinor Roosevelt. She encouraged him to go to college. He kind of agreed.

15
00:01:42.44 --> 00:01:46.28
One of the quotes he says in the book is he agreed because he was already the youngest master

16
00:01:46.28 --> 00:01:49.48
sergeant in the Army and he said, what am I going to do? Sit around the enlisted man's club,

17
00:01:49.48 --> 00:01:55.08
telling stories about Korea. So he was sort of not not over it, but he realized that he had

18
00:01:55.08 --> 00:02:02.76
kind of done what he was going to do. So he ends up getting assigned as an ROTC instructor at a high

19
00:02:02.76 --> 00:02:12.52
school in Denver because he liked to ski. Goes to the third Ranger class that ever happened.

20
00:02:12.52 --> 00:02:18.04
He was in. He ends up getting married to his hometown sweetheart, Mary Grace. Starts going

21
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:23.96
to college or he gets out of the Army then starts going to college at the University of Pittsburgh.

22
00:02:23.96 --> 00:02:29.56
While he's there, he writes a book called Conquest to Know where, which was his first book about

23
00:02:29.56 --> 00:02:33.96
the Korean War, which he later rewrote, which we covered. When it was rewritten, it was called

24
00:02:33.96 --> 00:02:40.04
the Making of the Soldier. That was podcast 273 for the most part. Worked at a steel mill at night

25
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:46.68
while he was going to college and then eventually commissioned as an officer in the Pennsylvania

26
00:02:46.68 --> 00:02:53.88
National Guard shot out to the two to eight iron soldiers. All right. So so then he goes to

27
00:02:53.88 --> 00:02:59.72
the knees back kind of in the Army and he gets some warnings at the Army's different now.

28
00:02:59.72 --> 00:03:05.000
You know, the war is over. Both the good people got out. We just left with people that shouldn't

29
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.16
even be in the Army that he got those kind of warnings. But he stayed in. He loves being a soldier.

30
00:03:11.16 --> 00:03:16.44
He wants to be a soldier. Goes to the basic army infantry course. When's nine out of 10

31
00:03:16.44 --> 00:03:23.32
awards there, including the leadership trophy, which is the leadership trophy is awarded by

32
00:03:24.36 --> 00:03:29.08
the other students. Like the other students select who deserves this leadership trophy,

33
00:03:29.88 --> 00:03:40.76
then he gets assigned as a Ranger instructor and he starts, he starts in the mountain phase. And so

34
00:03:41.72 --> 00:03:45.48
today we're going to be reading. So the first book that we covered, we covered a little bit. So

35
00:03:45.48 --> 00:03:50.52
he's written two books. Like I see written three one was conquest and nowhere. That one got rewritten

36
00:03:50.52 --> 00:03:54.68
as the making of a soldier. That was the bulk of what we read last time. This time we're going to

37
00:03:54.68 --> 00:04:02.60
read from his second book primarily and it's just called Soldier. Just called Soldier. And lots of

38
00:04:02.60 --> 00:04:10.60
lessons learned. But as I mentioned in the first podcast in 273, there's some serious lessons

39
00:04:10.60 --> 00:04:20.68
learned about life and things get really crazy when he goes to Vietnam as a battalion commander.

40
00:04:21.72 --> 00:04:28.68
And we will get there. All right. So here we go. Going to the book, Soldier written by

41
00:04:29.40 --> 00:04:35.32
Anthony B. Herbert. And he says this teaching young men, the essentials of mountain climbing, combat,

42
00:04:35.32 --> 00:04:39.48
and survival was more of a learning experience for me. Then for them, I began discovering things

43
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:45.24
about the resources in me as well as the way the army was moving. I was an alternate instructor at

44
00:04:45.24 --> 00:04:52.12
first, assigned to teach cliff descents on suspension traverses. I took it seriously. It was dangerous

45
00:04:52.12 --> 00:04:57.80
business if you didn't. The ropes to be used for traverses, which were one inch in diameter and

46
00:04:57.80 --> 00:05:05.64
900 feet long, cost the army about $300 each. I had set up two of the traverses on a 60 foot

47
00:05:05.64 --> 00:05:11.08
cliff the day before a new class was to begin. And that afternoon, I went out to inspect the ropes.

48
00:05:12.04 --> 00:05:17.80
One of the criteria for determining the quality of the kind of rope that was the present was the

49
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:25.16
presence of a tiny colored strand running all the way through its core. I inspected the first

50
00:05:25.16 --> 00:05:32.04
traverse and found the strand. But the second rope didn't have it, which meant that I simply couldn't

51
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:37.56
approve its use. The strand was an indication that the machines used to put the hemp together

52
00:05:37.56 --> 00:05:42.52
into a strong enough cord had worked the way they were supposed to. If the strand wasn't there,

53
00:05:42.52 --> 00:05:48.20
something had gone wrong and the rope might be faulty. I went back to my quarters and wrote an unsatisfactory

54
00:05:48.20 --> 00:05:52.12
report on the rope and then went to the chief instructor and told them of my findings.

55
00:05:53.24 --> 00:05:56.92
The army paid good money for that rope and you want to throw it away, he argued,

56
00:05:56.92 --> 00:06:02.60
we're not going to do that Herbert. I explained what I had found or rather what I had not found.

57
00:06:02.60 --> 00:06:08.68
Strand shmanned, he said, you go out there and test it again by going down the traverse. If it holds,

58
00:06:08.68 --> 00:06:15.56
if it holds you, it's okay. This is kind of a strange safety check, right? Go ahead and risk your

59
00:06:15.56 --> 00:06:20.04
life to see if it's going to work. I returned to the cliff and went down the traverse. So he does it.

60
00:06:20.68 --> 00:06:25.72
It held. It was supposed to be sturdy enough to support a Jeep. I went back and told the captain

61
00:06:25.72 --> 00:06:30.20
and he ordered me conduct the class the next day using the rope. I filed the unsatisfactory

62
00:06:30.20 --> 00:06:34.20
report and went to bed. The next morning, as we stood at the top of the cliff, I ordered the

63
00:06:34.20 --> 00:06:38.12
class into two lines. The captain nodded his approval from nearby. One group would use the

64
00:06:38.12 --> 00:06:42.04
traverse made of the rope, I'd inspect it and proved. The other would be would use the traverse

65
00:06:42.04 --> 00:06:48.04
of the rope, I'd inspect it and reject it. A young corporal in the second group stepped off.

66
00:06:48.04 --> 00:06:56.60
The rope snapped and he fell 60 feet to the rocks below. I went down quickly on the other

67
00:06:56.60 --> 00:07:01.000
traverse. His body was so broken. It almost crumbled in my hands as I lifted him into a Jeep

68
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.20
and sent him to the hospital. The captain had seen what happened. He left the scene running up

69
00:07:06.20 --> 00:07:11.32
over the hill. The students were nervous. They said, they weren't going through with it.

70
00:07:12.28 --> 00:07:16.20
I made them a little speech on courage and reminded them that they'd all known that

71
00:07:16.20 --> 00:07:20.84
Ranger training included risks. It seemed to work. We spent the rest of the morning learning how to

72
00:07:20.84 --> 00:07:25.88
use the traverse. There were no further accidents and at lunchtime I went back to base where

73
00:07:25.88 --> 00:07:32.28
Colonel Bierley and the captain asked me how the kid who fell was going to be. He'll be dead on a

74
00:07:32.28 --> 00:07:36.52
arrival, I said, don't say that. The captain said, you can't say that. How the hell do you know?

75
00:07:37.64 --> 00:07:42.28
Because I'm the one who put him on that Jeep for the hospital. He'll be dead on arrival.

76
00:07:42.28 --> 00:07:49.96
The phone rang. It was a hospital calling and the captain came back to Bierley and me with a

77
00:07:49.96 --> 00:07:55.88
strange look on his face. The hospital says he was dead on arrival. He reported. It was quiet in the

78
00:07:55.88 --> 00:08:03.88
office. Finally, the captain said, I was responsible for the accident. I realized that sir

79
00:08:03.88 --> 00:08:08.36
and I'll stand whatever comes from it. I said, you're responsible. You know he said,

80
00:08:08.36 --> 00:08:13.56
you're the one who's responsible. I know sir. I know. I answered.

81
00:08:16.92 --> 00:08:22.28
So I'm sure it's pretty obvious why I decided to pull out that particular quote because

82
00:08:23.88 --> 00:08:31.32
that is 100% accurate. Obviously he's taking ownership for what happened, but it's not just lip

83
00:08:31.32 --> 00:08:39.000
service. If you don't think something is right and you execute it, it's on you. It's on you.

84
00:08:41.96 --> 00:08:47.16
A little bit more from Ranger School and this book, look, this book is

85
00:08:49.48 --> 00:08:55.08
four, almost 500 pages long. And obviously I'm not reading the whole thing. There is so much good

86
00:08:55.08 --> 00:09:03.88
information and I'm just, I tried to parse it down to some key points along the way, but this is a

87
00:09:03.88 --> 00:09:10.52
book that is packed filled with knowledge. And I tried to bring out as much of that as I could,

88
00:09:11.56 --> 00:09:17.000
some of the war stories that I don't even go into. There's all kinds of combat scenarios that

89
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.96
I don't even go into. Just an incredible book. Fast forward a little bit here. I didn't develop any

90
00:09:23.96 --> 00:09:29.000
really sophisticated theories about teaching and I still haven't. What seemed to be important was that

91
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.04
the teacher know what he was talking about and be able to show as well as tell. One of the

92
00:09:34.04 --> 00:09:40.44
fouls he's an army training these days is that kind of experience is no longer part of the

93
00:09:40.44 --> 00:09:46.76
tradition. Kids are taught combat techniques by men who, through no fault of their own, of course,

94
00:09:46.76 --> 00:09:52.44
have never spent a moment in combat. And we wonder how it is that we turn out soldiers like Cali.

95
00:09:52.44 --> 00:09:59.88
Talk about Lieutenant Cali, Meal I Masker. What seemed most important then and still does

96
00:10:00.60 --> 00:10:05.72
was that the students realize that the army and war are not really games at all, even though they

97
00:10:05.72 --> 00:10:11.000
might seem that way at times, especially when you hear someone of the barroom tales,

98
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.80
or when you hear some of the barroom tales of the way it was at Inchon, where that night in the

99
00:10:15.80 --> 00:10:23.88
Meekong Delta. I saw so many army teachers who were trying to make up for the times when they had

100
00:10:23.88 --> 00:10:29.32
been down at the bottom of the heap, when they had been the ones taking orders. They played games

101
00:10:29.32 --> 00:10:36.12
with their men, building their egos with nitpicking orders that produced nothing but descent

102
00:10:36.12 --> 00:10:43.64
and ranker among the men. So often I found it that way in the military, the rules and the rags

103
00:10:43.64 --> 00:10:49.64
and the juvenile coverups and the children's games that had nothing to do with creating a system of

104
00:10:49.64 --> 00:10:58.76
discipline or building soldiers. It was simply an ego game. Again, I think it's quite obvious,

105
00:10:58.76 --> 00:11:05.000
well, why I, you know, I'm talking about this. This is something that we all have to watch out for.

106
00:11:05.56 --> 00:11:11.40
You get put in that position of authority. You got to watch out. You got to watch out. Some good

107
00:11:11.40 --> 00:11:17.32
opportunity for you to pump up your ego. Make them do some stupid stuff that doesn't make any sense.

108
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:22.92
And we'll do that all day long. If you like your ego run the show, that's what you're doing. And by the

109
00:11:22.92 --> 00:11:32.12
way, it creates what he say, descent amongst the troops. All right. So what he does in the next

110
00:11:32.12 --> 00:11:38.44
kind of stages of the books, he gets stationed in Germany, he kind of creates this provisional

111
00:11:38.44 --> 00:11:41.96
ranger, puttune, he becomes the commander of the provisional ranger, puttune,

112
00:11:43.32 --> 00:11:50.12
1962 he gets promoted to captain. He's deployed to Africa. He's deployed to the, well, the

113
00:11:50.12 --> 00:11:55.96
Congo in Africa, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, the Persian Gulf deployed to Bahrain, all in the

114
00:11:55.96 --> 00:12:03.16
60s. And there's all kinds of good stories in the book about these different situations that he's in.

115
00:12:03.16 --> 00:12:11.56
He's doing some kind of clandestine type operations. He's, it's just a, you know, borderline,

116
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:19.24
spies, scenarios going down, working with the CIA, interacting with the CIA, intelligent services,

117
00:12:19.24 --> 00:12:26.20
and this kind of stuff. So he does all that. 1966 goes back to being a ranger instructor.

118
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:31.72
It starts working towards his master's degree in psychology, gets his degree in 1968, gets off

119
00:12:31.72 --> 00:12:36.52
for the slot at war college. But of course he doesn't want to go to war college, not yet.

120
00:12:36.52 --> 00:12:43.40
Anyways, he wants to go to Vietnam. And the bunch of reasons, obviously, he has always felt that he

121
00:12:43.40 --> 00:12:51.64
wants to be a combat leader. And he sees an opportunity to lead. He also has never worked with

122
00:12:51.64 --> 00:13:00.84
helicopters at the level they were used in Vietnam. So, so he said quote, I wanted to know I wanted

123
00:13:00.84 --> 00:13:06.44
to go. I wanted to see I wanted to fight. Ask his chain to command. Hey, can I please go to Vietnam?

124
00:13:07.32 --> 00:13:11.56
And he does. He ends up getting orders to Vietnam. He wants to be a battalion commander,

125
00:13:11.56 --> 00:13:15.80
because by this time he's been promoted a few more times. He wants to be a battalion commander.

126
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:22.44
He doesn't show up immediately in Vietnam as a battalion commander. He has to pay his dues first.

127
00:13:22.44 --> 00:13:29.80
And the way he pays his dues is my becoming the Inspector General of the 173rd Airborne Brigade.

128
00:13:31.72 --> 00:13:35.32
So Inspector General, what's an Inspector General? The Inspector General,

129
00:13:37.16 --> 00:13:43.16
their mission, Inspector General mission is to quote, provide impartial objective and unbiased advice and

130
00:13:43.16 --> 00:13:49.48
oversight to the army through relevant timely and thorough inspections and assistance investigations

131
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:54.68
and training to promote and enable stewardship, accountability, integrity and efficiency.

132
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.16
Also good order and discipline and enhanced total army readiness. That's what an IG of you ever heard

133
00:14:03.16 --> 00:14:09.000
that term before IG Inspector General. Yes, you have. Where'd you hear it? What movie?

134
00:14:12.60 --> 00:14:16.84
I don't remember. You might have been like mash or something like this. Okay,

135
00:14:16.84 --> 00:14:23.16
okay, I was trying to think of a good way to explain all those things and have you ever seen

136
00:14:23.16 --> 00:14:28.92
police movies where they have the internal affairs? Well, yeah, that's kind of the, I think that's a good

137
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:35.08
comparison. Right? It's somebody that's kind of inspecting us like our team. Yeah, it's not, it's not

138
00:14:35.08 --> 00:14:38.52
hey, we're out inspecting, look what the bad guys are doing. We're looking at what we're doing as

139
00:14:38.52 --> 00:14:42.28
good guys. We're making sure we're doing the right things. Internal affairs always, it's

140
00:14:42.28 --> 00:14:49.56
or they came off as kind of like that wasn't a good thing when internal affairs is involved.

141
00:14:49.56 --> 00:14:54.44
It's kind of like they're investigating some some bad stuff. Yeah, something went something bad happen.

142
00:14:54.44 --> 00:14:59.64
Yeah, Inspector General comes out and I just hits me as something more like, hey, we're almost

143
00:14:59.64 --> 00:15:07.48
like a compliance officer like kind of like, hey, just to make sure everyone's kind of doing the right

144
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:14.12
thing. It's not like it seems like they're kind of on your side still. Okay. No. Well,

145
00:15:14.12 --> 00:15:17.96
straight on that phrase. If you're doing the right things they're on your side. If you're doing

146
00:15:17.96 --> 00:15:21.88
the wrong things just like internal affairs. If you were doing all the right things and internal

147
00:15:21.88 --> 00:15:25.80
affairs came along, you'd be like, oh, cool, they're here to keep people straight. If you were

148
00:15:25.80 --> 00:15:32.84
if you were a criminal or you were, if you were corrupt, right? Well, training day, your favorite

149
00:15:32.84 --> 00:15:39.16
movie. Yes sir. But is there internal affairs in training day? No. So there should have been.

150
00:15:39.16 --> 00:15:44.76
Right? You got there should have been someone tracking, hey, what's going on? Where's this money going?

151
00:15:44.76 --> 00:15:48.92
Where's this, you know, what are these reports? Why aren't they? Yeah, like in the whole scenario for

152
00:15:48.92 --> 00:15:54.60
sure, but probably not in the movie for the given that particular storyline, but yeah, yeah, overall for sure.

153
00:15:54.60 --> 00:16:00.20
Yeah, that's that guy. What's Denzel Washington's character name in that movie? Do you know,

154
00:16:00.20 --> 00:16:05.80
Alonzu? Okay. Alonzu would be a not a big fan of internal affairs. Most of all, although he was,

155
00:16:06.76 --> 00:16:12.28
he was such a mover and so manipulative. He might have had some internal affairs people that were on his side.

156
00:16:12.28 --> 00:16:16.76
Yeah, he kind of did imply that not internal affairs necessarily, but kind of like he had some people

157
00:16:16.76 --> 00:16:21.72
on the inside kind of backing his moves when they were talking about getting drug tested. There you go.

158
00:16:22.28 --> 00:16:27.48
There you go. So that's what that's what the IG is. And looking, I was in the Navy for 20 years.

159
00:16:27.48 --> 00:16:33.56
Obviously, I saw some IG inspections go down or the IG would get called in like maybe someone's

160
00:16:36.12 --> 00:16:43.24
some ammunition goes missing for an extent. It's not the kind of thing where something happens one time

161
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:48.76
and you know, the command would just kind of handle that. But if there's some kind of an ongoing problem,

162
00:16:49.32 --> 00:16:56.52
the I maybe someone's falsifying travel claims or something like that. Yeah, okay. So we're bringing in the IG

163
00:16:56.52 --> 00:17:02.68
who's going to give an unbiased look because, you know, maybe the commanders wrapped up in it or whatever.

164
00:17:02.68 --> 00:17:08.12
Yeah. So okay. So they're not just sort of around all the time or nothing like that. They call them in the first.

165
00:17:08.12 --> 00:17:14.20
It's called in the other place they could get used is let's say you work for me and I'm a tyrannical jerk.

166
00:17:14.92 --> 00:17:25.000
You could then reach out to the IG. Check. So you could reach out to the IG sort of through a anonymous.

167
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:35.16
You know, let me email or something and say, hey, this guy, Jocco is verbally and physically abusive.

168
00:17:35.16 --> 00:17:41.000
That's a good tip. Two, two his subordinates. So there you go.

169
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.64
So this guy shows up as the IG now. Now, like you said, it seems like they would be on our side.

170
00:17:49.64 --> 00:17:54.60
Right? Yeah. That was my misinterpretation though. I thought Inspector General sort of like just

171
00:17:54.60 --> 00:17:59.96
another guy who's there or another department kind of that's there all the time. That's kind of like, oh,

172
00:17:59.96 --> 00:18:04.04
hey, by the way, guys, you guys are kind of slacking over here. So let's tighten that up. We're all good kind of a thing.

173
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:08.68
So if you were doing the right things, the right reasons you'd have no reason to fear the IG.

174
00:18:09.40 --> 00:18:16.52
But if you were doing some things that were shady, you might you might not be very welcoming or you might be scared of them.

175
00:18:16.52 --> 00:18:24.20
Yeah. And the IG is obviously it's a weird role to play, right? Because you're looking at your team

176
00:18:24.92 --> 00:18:29.80
and you're sort of a, you can end up in a situation where you're accusing your team of doing things

177
00:18:29.80 --> 00:18:38.20
that are wrong. So it's weird dynamic. And so he shows up as the IG for this brigade. And

178
00:18:38.20 --> 00:18:55.000
and this is the thing about Anthony Herbert. He seems like a very, what's the word here? He's like a

179
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.84
straight shooter, right? Let's straight shooter that kind of a little bit of black and white,

180
00:19:00.84 --> 00:19:07.88
little bit of like, hey, right and wrong, good or bad, good or evil, he seems like he's got that kind of

181
00:19:07.88 --> 00:19:14.76
a personality. And actually you can go watch some of his interview. There's interviews of him on YouTube.

182
00:19:14.76 --> 00:19:21.56
And you can see some of them. But you're going to start to see that. And that's sort of in the first one

183
00:19:21.56 --> 00:19:27.000
that we when I did cover the beginning of this book just to talk about his upbringing. You know,

184
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.88
he's a church going guy. He's, so he's a, he's kind of, he's kind of a, he's very straightforward.

185
00:19:35.88 --> 00:19:45.48
And right or wrong. That's what the personality comes across for the most part to me. And so this IG,

186
00:19:47.96 --> 00:19:52.12
you know, he's going to kind of, he kind of comes out of the gate swinging. He kind of comes

187
00:19:52.12 --> 00:19:56.92
out of the gate swinging. And here we go. He's checking into this guy. He's checking in with

188
00:19:56.92 --> 00:20:02.60
this guy who's a, who's the lieutenant colonel, who they call the mayor of on K, you know,

189
00:20:02.60 --> 00:20:07.40
some, some outpost over there in Vietnam. The guy is the commander of the brigade support battalion.

190
00:20:07.40 --> 00:20:13.56
So he's checking in. And the guys saying, you know, I can get you this. I can get you that.

191
00:20:13.56 --> 00:20:21.08
But then he says, I, I expect some cooperation from you in return. He added, like what I asked.

192
00:20:21.08 --> 00:20:28.04
Well, like talking things over before they go to the general he replied, most things never even

193
00:20:28.04 --> 00:20:32.84
have to reach his ears if you and I cooperate. You know, Herbert, sort of run things ourselves,

194
00:20:32.84 --> 00:20:40.04
trust each other, get along and keep it all in the family. See where this is going? I stared at him

195
00:20:40.92 --> 00:20:47.80
and said he had to be joking. I realized almost instantly he was not. I'm supposed to be an IG.

196
00:20:47.80 --> 00:20:53.72
I said he seemed not to have heard launching and said into a lengthy recitation of his immense

197
00:20:53.72 --> 00:20:58.20
responsibilities as the man in charge of the barrack, the brigade's rear area headquarters.

198
00:20:58.20 --> 00:21:03.000
Everything at on K was under his purview. He said men slept where he told them to sleep and

199
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.24
took their meal wherever he assigned them and enjoyed themselves in his clubs and theaters and bought

200
00:21:09.24 --> 00:21:15.56
from his post exchange. It suddenly dawned on me that here was a senior lieutenant colonel,

201
00:21:15.56 --> 00:21:20.76
supposedly a professional soldier who was bragging about his job as a building officer, a task

202
00:21:20.76 --> 00:21:25.24
generally reserved for a second lieutenant in the states and usually for a not-to-keen second

203
00:21:25.24 --> 00:21:30.44
lieutenant at that. He rambled on and on about the scope of his influence and I tried hard to look

204
00:21:30.44 --> 00:21:37.40
interested and concerned. Finally he stopped. It was my turn. Look, Colonel, I understand your position

205
00:21:38.04 --> 00:21:43.16
and if you'll just assign me a room and a mess, I'll be glad to cooperate. I said he smiled

206
00:21:43.16 --> 00:21:48.84
and relaxed in his chair. But you have to understand my position too, I added. Now he was staring.

207
00:21:48.84 --> 00:21:57.32
I'm an IG. So I work for the commander who, by the way, is General Allen, not you. Since I work

208
00:21:57.32 --> 00:22:03.08
for the general, I'll report to the general and if that isn't a satisfactory arrangement for you,

209
00:22:03.08 --> 00:22:06.76
well then you can talk it over with the general and maybe the two of you can work something out more

210
00:22:06.76 --> 00:22:13.000
suitable. His jawline straighten noticeably. In the meantime, if you're finished, I have a lot of work to do.

211
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.76
I concluded he looked ill. Is there anything wrong? I asked rising from the bed. No, not at all.

212
00:22:20.76 --> 00:22:25.88
He said rather gloomly, also rising. I have some things to do myself. I nodded open the door

213
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:31.32
to the outer room and he left. The place was quiet until the sergeant spoke. You just made an

214
00:22:31.32 --> 00:22:37.08
enemy, sir. He said from his desk, a real danger, sent me. I walked into the outer room. Real

215
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:46.20
dangerous, real dangerous, real real dangerous. I repeated smiling slightly. Yes, sir. He's okay, sir.

216
00:22:46.20 --> 00:22:51.08
He said, sheepously when he noticed my grin, no kidding, sir. He's really bad news.

217
00:22:52.04 --> 00:22:58.60
I took some papers from his desk and looked at him. So am I, serge. I asked. I said, and I'm not

218
00:22:58.60 --> 00:23:12.68
kidding either. You see where this is going, right? So you can see where this is going. He's forming

219
00:23:12.68 --> 00:23:20.60
antagonistic relationship with a guy right out of the gate. I talked about this on EF online the other

220
00:23:20.60 --> 00:23:27.08
day. We talked about, take the high ground of the high ground will take you. But when you're all in the

221
00:23:27.08 --> 00:23:40.04
high ground, you have to be careful that you don't, that you don't launch attacks on other people

222
00:23:40.84 --> 00:23:50.04
from a position where you feel like you're superior to everybody else. You are in a superior position.

223
00:23:50.04 --> 00:23:54.28
This is known, right? You when you're on the high ground, you're in a superior position. But let me

224
00:23:54.28 --> 00:23:59.32
tell you this, when you start to launch attacks with the attitude that you're superior, you're

225
00:23:59.32 --> 00:24:07.64
giving up some of the high ground. So and this is what's really a hard line to walk in this

226
00:24:07.64 --> 00:24:14.28
book. And as I try and talk through, so I'm not going to do a good job of it. But just because you're right

227
00:24:15.80 --> 00:24:20.28
doesn't mean you're right. And you're going to see this over and over again. I mean this guy is a

228
00:24:20.28 --> 00:24:24.68
like morally at least he appears to be and again there's some controversy around that everything we're

229
00:24:24.68 --> 00:24:30.68
talking about. He certainly appears if you read the words that he writes in this book. He certainly

230
00:24:30.68 --> 00:24:37.80
appears to be a morally upstanding human being that and look at what he did, look at his heroic

231
00:24:37.80 --> 00:24:43.48
actions from the last podcast, what he did in the Korean War. This guy is willing to sacrifice

232
00:24:43.48 --> 00:24:50.76
for his brothers in arms. He's an incredible soldier and you're going to see how much his men,

233
00:24:51.80 --> 00:25:00.60
how much his men love than revered him, which is awesome. But he's on that high ground and he's

234
00:25:00.60 --> 00:25:05.80
this is this is what he's doing. He's on the high ground and he's looking down on others from the

235
00:25:05.80 --> 00:25:13.16
high ground. And when you do that, they don't like it. People don't like it. Doesn't feel good.

236
00:25:14.92 --> 00:25:20.44
Yeah, that's interesting. What would you, how did you just put it? Like you just because you're

237
00:25:20.44 --> 00:25:24.44
right doesn't mean you're right. Doesn't mean you're right. Yeah, so there's got to be a better way

238
00:25:24.44 --> 00:25:30.60
to say that. It's like just because you're right doesn't mean you should smack people in the

239
00:25:30.60 --> 00:25:35.96
person. If it doesn't mean other people are going to think that you're right. Yeah, just because you're right doesn't mean you're right or

240
00:25:35.96 --> 00:25:42.60
what you said actually does sound kind of cool. I feel like that should be the quote. I used to

241
00:25:42.60 --> 00:25:46.84
like get into little debates, whatever, with my brother. I think I told you this before where

242
00:25:47.96 --> 00:25:52.76
you know, he is. Yeah, kind of where. There's no. We understand getting debates with your brother. Yeah,

243
00:25:52.76 --> 00:26:00.84
he's down for the cause and it goes hard. But anyway, so we'd we'd give him to these things,

244
00:26:00.84 --> 00:26:04.68
you know, sometimes against my will or whatever. And so finally I came to the conclusion,

245
00:26:04.68 --> 00:26:08.92
they said, hey, what you're saying is like right is right, but what you're doing is wrong.

246
00:26:08.92 --> 00:26:11.56
Yeah. Like I see what you're saying and you're saying all the correct stuff, there's all

247
00:26:11.56 --> 00:26:15.08
true stuff, it's all factual and all this stuff. But what you're doing right now is wrong. Like you can't

248
00:26:15.08 --> 00:26:19.80
like force people into debates. You can't like. So it's kind of the same concept essentially.

249
00:26:19.80 --> 00:26:23.64
You know, where it's like, yeah, this guy is taking the he's doing the right thing. You know,

250
00:26:23.64 --> 00:26:27.32
he's he's right. He's doing the right thing. But what you're doing kind of right now in a big and

251
00:26:27.32 --> 00:26:31.64
essentially in a bigger picture, there's just a bigger picture in play. Yep. And look, there's a,

252
00:26:31.64 --> 00:26:38.84
there's there's things that are universally morally wrong. So there are things like that. Well,

253
00:26:38.84 --> 00:26:45.40
almost universally morally wrong. There's things that you can say that that that is not correct.

254
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:51.64
That is not right. That should not happen. When he starts, he's getting into some of this stuff

255
00:26:51.64 --> 00:27:00.60
early on. Look, you're right, Colonel Herbert, you're right, but you're, you're not going to

256
00:27:00.60 --> 00:27:07.80
make this easy. And if you, and if you, if you run around just slapping people from the high ground,

257
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.96
what you're doing is you're, you're, you have to get off the high ground to slap people. You're

258
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:19.16
coming down off the high ground to slap people. And what we're going to see how this unfolds.

259
00:27:22.52 --> 00:27:27.64
Fast forward a little bit. Within a few weeks, I realized that the desk sergeant had been worth

260
00:27:27.64 --> 00:27:32.68
listening to. He had a peg, pound for pound. The brigade was garbage. Discipline was laxed. The

261
00:27:32.68 --> 00:27:38.44
troops were slavingly disrespectful and sluggish. Mentally, as well as physically, it was obvious that

262
00:27:38.44 --> 00:27:44.36
on K, it was obvious that in on K, at least there were no match for either the Vietcong or the

263
00:27:44.36 --> 00:27:50.52
North Vietnamese regulars. As the sergeant said, they preferred pot to the one. But marijuana was

264
00:27:50.52 --> 00:27:55.88
only an expression of deeper, more serious failure. At on K, the troops wore what they damn well

265
00:27:55.88 --> 00:28:01.000
wanted to wear, including beads and bracelets. They cap their teeth with different colors, red,

266
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.60
blue and gold. And they called the hierarchy motherfuckers and printed fucked the green machine

267
00:28:06.60 --> 00:28:12.52
on their jackets and hats. Some of them wore earrings, a few sported nose rings, and the battle

268
00:28:12.52 --> 00:28:19.24
flag of the Confederacy flew for many of the bunkers. The sergeant was right about nobody giving a

269
00:28:19.24 --> 00:28:25.96
damn to, almost everyone looked the other way. On K was a staff and headquarters post crammed with

270
00:28:25.96 --> 00:28:33.08
chair-borne commando types. In any other war, it would have been ridiculous, but not in Vietnam.

271
00:28:33.08 --> 00:28:40.36
Every careerist who could re-do his way was over there drawing combat pay while the citizens

272
00:28:40.36 --> 00:28:45.000
back home were getting blood for the bill. The troops knew best what to call it, a humbug.

273
00:28:47.48 --> 00:28:54.52
The 173rd was the largest brigade in Vietnam with over 10,000 men attached to it. It was according

274
00:28:54.52 --> 00:29:01.000
to the manual, a combat brigade with absolutely no dead weight. But it was a humbug. There were

275
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.76
five so-called combat battalions in the brigade and not one of them had more than 600 physically

276
00:29:06.76 --> 00:29:13.40
present for duty. Out of a total of 10,000 men, there were no more than 3,000 at the battalion level,

277
00:29:13.40 --> 00:29:20.36
which means that some 7,000 were assigned to support roles. Stayed houses, pizza huts, clubs,

278
00:29:20.36 --> 00:29:26.60
headquarters, the general's mess, artillery, engineers, etc. Even among the approximately 3,000

279
00:29:26.60 --> 00:29:32.20
at the combat battalion level, not all were looking, not all were out looking with their rifles.

280
00:29:33.08 --> 00:29:38.28
Somewhere, of course, but the battalions had their own rear areas, just like the brigade,

281
00:29:38.28 --> 00:29:43.32
with their own stay-couses and their own clubs. Each battalion was composed of five companies.

282
00:29:43.32 --> 00:29:49.56
One of them, a makeshift out-out fit responsible for heavy weapons, which left four companies

283
00:29:49.56 --> 00:29:55.16
for walking. No company in the battalion of brigade had more than 75 men physically present and

284
00:29:55.16 --> 00:30:01.72
ready to go, thus each battalion fielded about 300 combat troopers. Except that each battalion

285
00:30:01.72 --> 00:30:07.80
assigned one company to guard its base of operations each day, that left the maximum of 225

286
00:30:07.80 --> 00:30:14.84
man available for the field. Or 1,125 on the brigade basis, and that would have been on a good

287
00:30:14.84 --> 00:30:19.64
day with everybody out and everybody with a rifle, but everybody didn't carry a rifle.

288
00:30:19.64 --> 00:30:25.08
Some totaled radios, some stayed back and typed, some worked in company supply, some were

289
00:30:25.08 --> 00:30:31.16
fireflies, the daily helicopter resupply lifts, and some were just planes screwed off. So on an

290
00:30:31.16 --> 00:30:39.96
average day, the 173rd airborne brigade could feel a proxmily 800 men. If all of its battalions were out,

291
00:30:39.96 --> 00:30:45.56
in the year I was in the brigade, all the battalions were never out simultaneously. We feel less

292
00:30:45.56 --> 00:30:53.000
than 800 out of 10,000 troops in the brigade. On a country-wide basis, it meant that out of 500,000 men,

293
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.20
we had there at the peak of our involvement, less than 50,000 were engaged in the business of fighting

294
00:30:58.20 --> 00:31:03.16
in the field. And that figure applies only if all the other outfits were doing as well as the

295
00:31:03.16 --> 00:31:08.44
173rd. As General West Morlin, like to say, the 173rd was the cream of the whole crop.

296
00:31:09.24 --> 00:31:13.64
It wasn't that our kids didn't fight well in the field. It was just that so damn few of them

297
00:31:13.64 --> 00:31:19.24
ever got there. We had a 500,000 man army, fielding less than one infantry division in

298
00:31:19.24 --> 00:31:26.20
dead in World War II or in Korea. On paper, we were hell on wheels. The report's on a column for it

299
00:31:26.20 --> 00:31:34.76
in the field. And on paper, it was 98% or more every day. I've filed those reports myself and they

300
00:31:34.76 --> 00:31:40.36
looked truly magnificent. All the guys at the stay-couse in the field, all the guys at the club

301
00:31:40.36 --> 00:31:46.04
in the field. The General's orderlies in the field, the lifeguards at Esther William Swimming Pool

302
00:31:46.04 --> 00:31:52.20
in the field. Stunning, absolutely stunning, and from time to time, I found myself and

303
00:31:52.20 --> 00:31:56.84
climbed to go along with it. It was so mesmerizing that when I later took over,

304
00:31:56.84 --> 00:32:02.60
but telling myself, I added another column to my reporting procedure just to keep things straight.

305
00:32:03.40 --> 00:32:08.44
As in the grass, I called the new column. It was no joke. It was necessary.

306
00:32:08.44 --> 00:32:17.80
And as in the grass, means you're actually in the field. You can see this guy, he's going hard in the

307
00:32:17.80 --> 00:32:27.56
paint. And again, I'm reading from the book. I'm not, these, I don't, we're going to get to sort

308
00:32:27.56 --> 00:32:32.76
of some of the pushback against this stuff, but we have to take him for what he's saying.

309
00:32:32.76 --> 00:32:41.08
Well, we have to, let me refer to it. We have to listen to what he's saying. He goes on here.

310
00:32:41.08 --> 00:32:45.80
I soon discovered that almost all the problems at any level of the brigade were either the

311
00:32:45.80 --> 00:32:52.44
director or indirect result of piss poor leadership. Being an IG, so you kind of, he's got this attitude

312
00:32:52.44 --> 00:32:57.56
and he's the IG. What, as you can be making friends, what's your prediction?

313
00:32:57.56 --> 00:33:04.68
Being an IG is an extremely educational experience. I was spending about twenty nights a month

314
00:33:04.68 --> 00:33:11.08
with assing the grass troops, blending him as well as I could, taking every opportunity afforded

315
00:33:11.08 --> 00:33:15.000
me to discuss tactics. I found that one of the best ways to get to know any particular outfit

316
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.36
was to accompany its men on an ambush. Generally, they were disgrace. So this is interesting.

317
00:33:20.36 --> 00:33:25.40
I guarantee, and I don't, you know, I don't use that word very often. He shows up as the IG

318
00:33:25.40 --> 00:33:29.40
and what does he do? He starts going in the field all the time with the troops. Because he's that kind

319
00:33:29.40 --> 00:33:34.12
of bro. You know, he's that kind of brother that's just like, oh, I'll be in the army. We got troops.

320
00:33:34.12 --> 00:33:38.76
I'm going in the field. So that's what he starts doing. And as you're going out on patrol,

321
00:33:38.76 --> 00:33:42.92
well, this is what he finds. The fault was obvious poor leadership and more specific

322
00:33:43.48 --> 00:33:49.24
absentee leadership. Few of the ambush patrols, I accompanied included a senior or non-commissioned

323
00:33:49.24 --> 00:33:54.12
officer. The enlisted men at humped all day long and carried their load. And then at night,

324
00:33:54.12 --> 00:33:58.60
they were expected to stay awake and cut it again the next day. They took their sleep where and

325
00:33:58.60 --> 00:34:03.40
when they could get it on patrol and for what most and for the most part, the company commanders

326
00:34:03.40 --> 00:34:07.64
didn't know what the hell was going on or worse just didn't care. It was their fault. But the

327
00:34:07.64 --> 00:34:11.80
real culprits were at the higher level, battalion commanders who rode out the procedures,

328
00:34:11.80 --> 00:34:16.76
almost verbatim from the fort-bending operations and training handbook, passed them down to their

329
00:34:16.76 --> 00:34:23.16
subordinates and let it go at that. They were covered. The procedures had no relationship to the

330
00:34:23.16 --> 00:34:29.80
realities of combat. And you got to remember the Colonel that originally told me about this book,

331
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.44
this guy is the same kind of vein as Hacworth. He's coming at you. And he loves being a soldier

332
00:34:40.44 --> 00:34:47.48
and he loves his soldiers. But he's got no love for the upper chain of command. You can, as you can see,

333
00:34:47.48 --> 00:34:54.76
a field standards, which apply to combat conditions are important. And those were the criteria I

334
00:34:54.76 --> 00:34:58.92
applied as I walked through B company's area and then he's getting into like actually being out there.

335
00:34:58.92 --> 00:35:04.68
A good soldier wears even the most ragged deer well. Even in the field, he is trim,

336
00:35:04.68 --> 00:35:09.48
neat and tight with pockets buttoned and no loose or hanging straps or webbing. He does not wear

337
00:35:09.48 --> 00:35:14.76
sunglasses. He keeps a clean face and clean weapon and clean ammunition. These kids didn't cut it.

338
00:35:14.76 --> 00:35:19.24
The reason I could only conclude was poor leadership. Leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield.

339
00:35:21.32 --> 00:35:25.96
Good or bad. It was strictly a matter of leadership. He's talking about going on patrol with a

340
00:35:25.96 --> 00:35:32.04
couple different companies. Take the contrast I found between B company and C company. It was the

341
00:35:32.04 --> 00:35:35.72
same battalion, same area of operations with approximately the same number of troops in the same

342
00:35:35.72 --> 00:35:43.08
kind of mission. Yeah, while B company was a mess, C company was struck strategic tough and ready around the

343
00:35:43.08 --> 00:35:48.92
clock. They were airborne man all the way. One night I went along in a pertune size patrol

344
00:35:48.92 --> 00:35:54.20
commanded by a young lieutenant. It was like clockwork, like beautiful Swiss clockwork. We moved quietly,

345
00:35:54.20 --> 00:35:58.52
paused for a silent C rap meal and drifted off further into the brush to set up shop. Nobody

346
00:35:58.52 --> 00:36:03.64
smoked nobody talked Charlie company in a lieutenant Webster or hunters. And as I sat tight against

347
00:36:03.64 --> 00:36:08.52
a palm tree that night I felt good about being out there with them. They had a purpose. Just before

348
00:36:08.52 --> 00:36:15.32
dawn Webster received orders. This is such a good lesson. Just before dawn Webster received orders

349
00:36:15.32 --> 00:36:22.12
to drift back to base. About 12 miles away. Helicopters were unavailable. He was told. So orders

350
00:36:22.12 --> 00:36:27.16
were to foot it back and bring along the mermaids. The thermal food containers that weighed about

351
00:36:27.16 --> 00:36:32.20
30 pounds of work clumsy as hell to carry. Webster stared at me in the early morning light.

352
00:36:32.20 --> 00:36:38.76
It's stupid. He said, but it's an order I replied playing at straight. He looked at me steadily

353
00:36:38.76 --> 00:36:44.60
and then made up his mind. Yeah, he said, well fuck them. We're not carrying no goddamn cans back

354
00:36:44.60 --> 00:36:49.000
through the bush. He turned to his radio man. Pass the word to get rid of the garbage cans and

355
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.36
all. We're going to take a hike so keep it light and don't leave anything for Charlie.

356
00:36:53.24 --> 00:36:56.84
The radio man turned to leave and Webster stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.

357
00:36:56.84 --> 00:37:02.28
The first fucking noise somebody gets it in the mouth. He warned and then turned to me.

358
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:08.60
I'll take the gig and the asked chewing. Webster had a real outfit because he was a real leader.

359
00:37:08.60 --> 00:37:13.80
He had a good reputation and he earned an even larger one by the time we left. The captain

360
00:37:13.80 --> 00:37:19.16
and B company and Webster and C company both at the same raw material. Yeah, one was running a

361
00:37:19.16 --> 00:37:24.04
sloppy sad ass show that couldn't cut it. The other was commanding a tough tight combat ready

362
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:33.64
and combat able outfit. The difference was leadership. So there you go. That's a freaking classic

363
00:37:33.64 --> 00:37:39.56
case of you get told do something stupid. What's the good leader do? Now he could have had that

364
00:37:39.56 --> 00:37:44.04
argument. Maybe he said, hey, you really don't want me to carry this stuff. That's just a big pain in

365
00:37:44.04 --> 00:37:48.68
the ass and he says, you know what? There's a kernel here. Fuck it. We're not doing that. That

366
00:37:48.68 --> 00:38:01.64
doesn't make sense. He says this. If a legitimate study is made of that war, most Americans will

367
00:38:01.64 --> 00:38:05.64
be stundled learn that we killed the hell of a lot of our own people. Once again, a failure

368
00:38:05.64 --> 00:38:10.76
directly traceable the poor leadership. All that took was the sound of a booby trap or the

369
00:38:10.76 --> 00:38:14.92
sighting of movement and we were prone to just open up to fire to the jungle and brush in every

370
00:38:14.92 --> 00:38:20.12
direction without any idea of who might be on the right or left or behind or ahead. We did it

371
00:38:20.12 --> 00:38:30.60
over and over again to ourselves. Here's an example he gives. Once again, we had killed one of our own

372
00:38:30.60 --> 00:38:36.76
and this particular case he had caused his own death that was said. He was a young lieutenant out on

373
00:38:36.76 --> 00:38:42.28
his first patrol. According to the report, he had set up the ambush and then left its perimeter

374
00:38:42.28 --> 00:38:48.28
to establish security, which was completely asked backwards but nevertheless the way he had been

375
00:38:48.28 --> 00:38:55.80
trained by the US Army. When I was in Ranger School at Fort Benning, I had seen the examples

376
00:38:55.80 --> 00:39:04.36
set dozens of times without any criticism. Training bullshit. We had too many damn academics.

377
00:39:04.36 --> 00:39:09.88
We trained not only with blank ammunition but with blank attitudes as well, using instructors who

378
00:39:09.88 --> 00:39:14.92
had gone through the same kind of blank training men who in their wildest dreams could not relate

379
00:39:14.92 --> 00:39:19.56
to a real combat patrol because it never meant part of their own experience. The Army claimed

380
00:39:19.56 --> 00:39:25.16
the instructors were combat veterans and some no doubt were but most had merely been in combat

381
00:39:25.16 --> 00:39:32.28
zones. Because of that kind of training, the young lieutenant was dead. The report detailed how he had

382
00:39:32.28 --> 00:39:38.68
gone out from the patrol's main body to position the outpost people himself just as he had been

383
00:39:38.68 --> 00:39:44.12
taught and then headed back through the deep jungle and at night alone toward his main group.

384
00:39:45.32 --> 00:39:49.96
In the daylight moving through brush his heart at night, it's a formidable task.

385
00:39:50.84 --> 00:39:58.04
When his men heard movement to their rear, the report related, they called him on the radio.

386
00:39:58.76 --> 00:40:03.48
At least he had enough sense to take it along. So they got an ambush set up. He goes to

387
00:40:03.48 --> 00:40:10.20
set some security out now. He's walking back and the guys that are in the ambush here noise.

388
00:40:10.20 --> 00:40:16.12
So they call him up and say, hey, you know, we hear noise behind us. And what does the lieutenant say?

389
00:40:16.12 --> 00:40:19.88
He says, Kremum and they did. He was dropped in his tracks.

390
00:40:20.76 --> 00:40:26.28
Schooled, trained, ranger, airborne and he had ordered his own execution.

391
00:40:27.88 --> 00:40:32.68
I tried to console myself by thinking that anybody so goddamn ignorant deserved to die,

392
00:40:32.68 --> 00:40:39.08
but it didn't work. I knew he had been trained by guys like me, not me personally, but by senior

393
00:40:39.08 --> 00:40:45.72
personnel like me. It was our fault. I tried to imagine myself doing what he had done

394
00:40:46.28 --> 00:40:52.20
even several years earlier and I couldn't. He was worse than untrained. He was badly trained.

395
00:40:52.20 --> 00:40:57.80
He had no business being out there in charge on his first patrol and his battalion commander couldn't

396
00:40:57.80 --> 00:41:04.12
be held blameless either. It was sickening. We were the healthiest, wealthiest, supposedly best

397
00:41:04.12 --> 00:41:09.16
trained soldiers in the world. Our army had the finest raw material of any country. We had the

398
00:41:09.16 --> 00:41:14.44
equipment and the experience to do better. We fought like a bunch of amateurs. I shoved my coffee

399
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:20.20
aside and looked around the talk. There were white cloths and flowers on the tables and paintings

400
00:41:20.20 --> 00:41:26.68
on the walls. It was ludicrous. I grabbed a chopper back to on K and on the way, constructed the

401
00:41:26.68 --> 00:41:32.12
rest of the night, that night's pitiful drama. The dead lieutenant was from a little town in

402
00:41:32.12 --> 00:41:37.64
Pennsylvania, not far from where I had grown up. A telegram would soon arrive and the middle-aged

403
00:41:37.64 --> 00:41:42.44
mother would collapse on the couch in the living room while the father tried to console her through

404
00:41:42.44 --> 00:41:48.68
his own tears. I imagine myself walking into the room and standing at the end of the couch,

405
00:41:48.68 --> 00:41:55.88
looking down on them and saying that I had killed their kid. The vision passed and I was grateful

406
00:41:55.88 --> 00:42:00.12
that he wasn't one of my men and I wouldn't have to explain it even to myself.

407
00:42:07.16 --> 00:42:12.92
We had much, much, too much. Whatever the reason was, the nature of war, the difference in the

408
00:42:12.92 --> 00:42:17.48
attitudes and the personnel, the abundance was overwhelming. The red cross, for instance, came

409
00:42:17.48 --> 00:42:24.68
up with 15,000 individual Christmas packages for the 10,000 men of the 173rd. He's kind of going

410
00:42:24.68 --> 00:42:33.40
on a rant here about just what that giant logistical and rear echelon footprint was like,

411
00:42:33.40 --> 00:42:39.56
Sergeant Renn, the motel, they have a motel, the motel manager told me and booth that the tab for

412
00:42:39.56 --> 00:42:46.60
the brigade's entertainment ran close to $200,000 a month. So there's all this stuff is going on

413
00:42:47.24 --> 00:42:52.92
and look, he counts for a lot of this stuff that he's investigating with the IG. There's stealing

414
00:42:52.92 --> 00:43:00.04
going on, there's fraud going on, there's rape going on, sexual harassment, sexual assaults,

415
00:43:00.04 --> 00:43:06.68
and murder, and prisoner abuse, people going awall, there's all kinds of criminal behavior happening.

416
00:43:09.16 --> 00:43:15.000
He goes into this one. The records of the stay counts and pizza hut were equally shocking.

417
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.72
Tons of meat were unaccounted for along with thousands of pre-fixed pizzas and truckloads of

418
00:43:19.72 --> 00:43:24.60
liquor and beer. Three years later Congress would be pulling the covers off what would become known

419
00:43:24.60 --> 00:43:30.52
as the club scandals. It would involve generals at the very top and the very top Sergeant of the

420
00:43:30.52 --> 00:43:36.52
whole army, Sergeant Major Woolrich, whom General Westmoreland himself had handpicked as the

421
00:43:36.52 --> 00:43:41.64
US Army's first top kick, even then the army would be trying to sweep it under the rug.

422
00:43:43.16 --> 00:43:47.96
It was in our brigade that the investigation which led to the scandal started our investigation

423
00:43:47.96 --> 00:43:54.60
launched at General Allen's request. The lines were being drawn and the IG shop was no longer

424
00:43:54.60 --> 00:44:00.84
sluffed off in dinner conversations. It'd become a power and I'd become for some of my comrades and

425
00:44:00.84 --> 00:44:14.76
arms the enemy. Fast forward a little bit. He's looking, he's, remember, he went there as the

426
00:44:14.76 --> 00:44:19.24
IG but he's supposed to get a battalion and become a battalion commander eventually. It would be

427
00:44:19.24 --> 00:44:23.88
the third battalion and I would get it in April. He said this would necessitate an extension of

428
00:44:23.88 --> 00:44:29.08
my tour so I could get in my six months minimum of command time. But it would be worth the

429
00:44:29.08 --> 00:44:33.32
extension he said. The present commander of the third battalion would have six months in by April,

430
00:44:33.32 --> 00:44:38.92
which was another anomaly of the Vietnam War. It mattered not that a commander was doing a great

431
00:44:38.92 --> 00:44:44.04
job or a crappy job. Six months was the magic number. Officer's got their tickets punched in

432
00:44:44.04 --> 00:44:49.16
six months and then got the hell out to some other assignment to work on another credit or get

433
00:44:49.16 --> 00:44:54.76
their another coupon certified. General West Morland had said it a long time before when I was

434
00:44:54.76 --> 00:44:59.96
a major that the Russians were very envious of the way our officer corps was getting tremendous

435
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:06.04
combat experience in Vietnam and even then I knew it was bullshit. It takes a commander a couple

436
00:45:06.04 --> 00:45:10.76
months to become acclimated to his responsibility, a couple more to get going and then he's gone. It was

437
00:45:10.76 --> 00:45:17.48
crazy. Besides we were losing in Vietnam. A fact which the US Army officer corps seemed not to want

438
00:45:17.48 --> 00:45:22.52
to recognize. It would have been better to have fought the whole goddamn war with a hundred honest

439
00:45:22.52 --> 00:45:27.000
to God commanders than a thousand of the half-ass combat leader types we were producing.

440
00:45:27.96 --> 00:45:33.48
Whatever gave the notion we could build a better mouse trap in six months. It was a pipe dream

441
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:39.32
and what was worse was that the leaders quote the quote leaders we were grinding out

442
00:45:39.32 --> 00:45:47.16
would be not an asset but a detriment in a big war should one come. Then they would be considered

443
00:45:47.16 --> 00:45:56.84
experts and the delusion would cost us plenty. So you go there, you're a Italian commander for six

444
00:45:56.84 --> 00:46:02.84
months, get your box checked and then you're out. And by the way now all of a sudden you're a

445
00:46:02.84 --> 00:46:13.96
Italian commander. So that means what you say is gold. Another thing he's got to deal with.

446
00:46:13.96 --> 00:46:21.64
Fracking. Fracking the deliberate attack on a non-com or an officer by an enlisted man or

447
00:46:21.64 --> 00:46:27.72
men was not unknown in the 173. One sergeant over in the signal section had made the mistake of

448
00:46:27.72 --> 00:46:32.92
raising hell with a trooper about the cleanliness of his area. The man wired to claim or mine

449
00:46:32.92 --> 00:46:37.88
outside the sergeants room aimed it right through the wall of the switch at the switchboard

450
00:46:37.88 --> 00:46:45.56
went to a phone and called his victim. The sergeant lost both legs. There was a fracking in second

451
00:46:45.56 --> 00:46:51.64
battalion too with seven wounded. They tried to get Nicholson with explosives and on another

452
00:46:51.64 --> 00:46:56.12
occasion they tried to blow up his tactile operation center. One of the men in second battalion

453
00:46:56.12 --> 00:47:01.24
had reportedly blown himself the bits with a claim or mine but my investigation failed to corroborate

454
00:47:01.24 --> 00:47:07.24
this. It had been in his hands. So here's a guy with a claim or mine in his hands. That was

455
00:47:07.24 --> 00:47:12.52
certain but there were two men in nearby bunker handering the candling the controls of the mine

456
00:47:12.52 --> 00:47:17.96
went off. The victim had left the bunker to retrieve the mine at the request of the other two

457
00:47:17.96 --> 00:47:24.92
and somehow they said the circuit had been completed. I wasn't a real detective but even though

458
00:47:24.92 --> 00:47:31.08
two company commander Swarr it was accidental I did sign my report with a recommendation that the

459
00:47:31.08 --> 00:47:35.32
criminal investigation division checked into it they never did.

460
00:47:37.40 --> 00:47:44.44
Fourth battalion had a genuine insurrection. Herb Matsuo, the executive the battalion executive officer told

461
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:49.64
me an old Colonel living in an air condition trailer to become sort of a father figure for the

462
00:47:49.64 --> 00:47:55.72
riff raff in the battalion. No kidding, Tony, Herb said he's actually pulled all the freaks in

463
00:47:55.72 --> 00:48:00.60
around him and made a personal bodyguard outfit with weapons and all and the old geezers

464
00:48:00.60 --> 00:48:05.48
dumb enough to believe they're responding to him. The Colonel called his men the Mafioso.

465
00:48:06.60 --> 00:48:11.40
They're going to cause serious trouble, Tony. They're the worst kind of people we have over here.

466
00:48:11.40 --> 00:48:20.20
They're killers and I'm not joking. You better get worded general island before it's too late. I think

467
00:48:20.20 --> 00:48:30.12
I'm maybe kind of confused. So, fragging is a term where it's what it means is you got an officer

468
00:48:30.12 --> 00:48:34.36
or you've got a senior enlisted person that you don't like and you kill him.

469
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:44.04
That's a thing. There you go. There's two examples. They put it in movies in Platoon. You've

470
00:48:44.04 --> 00:48:50.84
seen Platoon, right? No. What? I don't hear anything. Are you serious? I am serious. I have never

471
00:48:50.84 --> 00:48:59.96
seen Platoon. Well, go assignment. Go watch Platoon. Yeah, okay. So, okay, okay, it's a movies.

472
00:48:59.96 --> 00:49:05.56
Uh, yeah, there's a lot of things in movies, but it's seen. That seems really weird. Obviously,

473
00:49:05.56 --> 00:49:11.16
that doesn't happen. Nowties. Well, you'd certainly hope not. Yeah, I mean, I've, I've never heard

474
00:49:11.16 --> 00:49:16.68
of a crazy case of fragging now, but yes, in Vietnam, it absolutely. Like, there's, there you go.

475
00:49:16.68 --> 00:49:26.36
There's cases up right there. So, so, imagine this. You are a young 21-year-old, 19-year-old,

476
00:49:26.36 --> 00:49:32.28
18-year-old person. You don't believe in this war. You don't like it. You don't want to die.

477
00:49:32.76 --> 00:49:38.20
And in comes, you know, Lieutenant Rambo, that's like, we're going to go out. We're going to take

478
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:43.32
the fight to the enemy. And you think you can get killed. Yeah. And he's going to charge you with

479
00:49:43.32 --> 00:49:49.72
being a coward or whatever. Yeah. You're killing people. That's what's happening over there. So,

480
00:49:49.72 --> 00:49:54.36
you're going out on a combat operation. You get into a firefight. Oh, Lieutenant,

481
00:49:54.36 --> 00:49:59.56
young Lieutenant happens to get shot. Yeah. I guess I'm training day technically that's what he did

482
00:50:00.36 --> 00:50:04.12
or was trying to do where it's like, yeah, you know, we're going to see if this guy's going to

483
00:50:04.12 --> 00:50:11.24
play ball with us in our, in our group. He doesn't. And then he sets him up to get killed. Yeah,

484
00:50:11.24 --> 00:50:16.76
that's a, well, yeah, that's a fragging. It tries to do it anyway. Yeah, it's a real thing.

485
00:50:16.76 --> 00:50:26.28
It's a real thing. There's another, he's doing an investigation of a company that got

486
00:50:26.28 --> 00:50:33.24
creamed. He said, so this company like took massive casualties and he's talking through it.

487
00:50:33.96 --> 00:50:40.44
What had happened with, uh, he's about to talk through with General Allen. It had been marijuana.

488
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:46.52
I took it back to Allen and he didn't like it one bit. The company had been creamed and there was an

489
00:50:46.52 --> 00:50:51.32
single dead enemy. I suggested that we write it up as a lesson. The learned one that even a

490
00:50:51.32 --> 00:50:57.40
knit wit trooper could understand no one individual had been at fault. I reasoned it had been marijuana.

491
00:50:57.40 --> 00:51:01.56
And as bad as that was, it would serve as a valuable purpose. It would serve a valuable purpose as a

492
00:51:01.56 --> 00:51:09.16
combat lesson for the living. Marijuana and guns don't miss mix. The general was staring at me when I

493
00:51:09.16 --> 00:51:15.72
finished. You must be mad. I said, sir, do you realize what you're asking he said, walking over to his

494
00:51:15.72 --> 00:51:20.60
window for another glance at those goddamn flowers? He's got flowers like panel planted outside of his

495
00:51:20.60 --> 00:51:26.44
window. Sir, can you imagine what you've just suggested? Those were American kids. Two captains

496
00:51:26.44 --> 00:51:31.16
in a hell of a lot of American kids are dead. He threw up his hands and discussed and shot sat down

497
00:51:31.16 --> 00:51:36.04
at his desk and you want me to tell higher headquarters and their families that they were on dope.

498
00:51:36.76 --> 00:51:41.56
Not dope sir, marijuana. And we don't have to say that everyone was on it. Just point out that

499
00:51:41.56 --> 00:51:49.000
the reason they had had their asses creamed. He stood up again. I'll have to think about it.

500
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.88
For the time being, just keep it to yourself. Understand? I stood up. I understand sir. He sat back

501
00:51:53.88 --> 00:52:00.44
down again and I will consider it. Later I read about A company's fate in the stars and stripes

502
00:52:00.44 --> 00:52:06.92
and in our own brigade newspaper, the sky's soldier. The two accounts were nearly identical. The company

503
00:52:06.92 --> 00:52:12.92
had put up one hell of a fight but it had been overrun by a numerically superior force at a substantial

504
00:52:12.92 --> 00:52:18.44
cost to the enemy. It was one more glorious chapter in the glorious history of the 173rd

505
00:52:18.44 --> 00:52:23.88
Eric born brigade. The official accounts of that night on the hill were a goddamn discredited to

506
00:52:23.88 --> 00:52:28.84
every mother's son who fought worth a lick and Vietnam. The general no doubt believed it saved some

507
00:52:28.84 --> 00:52:41.32
face. I never mentioned it again. So you know you get like this is Matt Mass coverups right?

508
00:52:41.32 --> 00:52:45.000
And no lessons learned by the way. So that lesson learned doesn't get passed on anybody.

509
00:52:48.36 --> 00:52:53.000
The story of A company's heroism and gallantry was published about the same day. The lieutenant

510
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.64
Colonel Joseph Ross Franklin joined the brigade as a replacement as the deputy commander. Franklin

511
00:52:59.64 --> 00:53:05.48
had graduated from West Point 1949. One of the distinguished service cross in Korea. His head was

512
00:53:05.48 --> 00:53:11.64
completely hairless. He shaved it. He looked like a badass combat commander. He was impressive. No doubt

513
00:53:13.32 --> 00:53:19.32
and his teeth sparkled. They say he's a breath of fresh air. Abbott remarked. So here comes this

514
00:53:19.32 --> 00:53:30.76
guy Franklin and I think he's the most decorated officer from his class at West Point. This guy

515
00:53:30.76 --> 00:53:40.60
Franklin and that's from Korea. And so you think you know if you were decorated highly decorated

516
00:53:40.60 --> 00:53:44.36
veteran from Korea and I was a decorated highly decorated veteran from Korea there's a good chance

517
00:53:44.36 --> 00:53:49.88
that you and I could meet and be like hey bro right on right like we could just be you know have this

518
00:53:49.88 --> 00:53:56.20
kind of unified past right sure what else could happen. You'll a little bit threaten some competition

519
00:53:56.20 --> 00:54:00.52
you should have some ego scenarios right we could have that competition between you and me and I

520
00:54:00.52 --> 00:54:05.000
think I'm a little bit braver than you my my medals are a little bit made of whatever yeah.

521
00:54:06.20 --> 00:54:11.88
Well unfortunately no it's it didn't and it gonna be growing out.

522
00:54:11.88 --> 00:54:13.88
Yeah.

523
00:54:16.92 --> 00:54:22.20
Here we go. How about a briefing he finally suggested and don't pull any punches Herbert.

524
00:54:23.80 --> 00:54:28.68
When I finished he had one question where that bad huh? Where worse sir but you'll see it for yourself

525
00:54:29.24 --> 00:54:34.12
and it's not because the caliber of the troops either. We have the finest top sergeants I have

526
00:54:34.12 --> 00:54:38.52
ever known in the army and we have the healthiest toughest privates you can find anywhere.

527
00:54:38.52 --> 00:54:46.60
But the worst general he said not really I said Allen is okay. Then leadership sir I said

528
00:54:47.16 --> 00:54:51.08
and then he not then as he nodded I related every last air ride scene in the brigade.

529
00:54:51.64 --> 00:54:57.88
When I finished I attributed them all directly to lack of leadership. How do you mean that Herbert

530
00:54:57.88 --> 00:55:04.20
Franklin asked? It was precisely what I wanted him to ask. The troops are ragged asked because they

531
00:55:04.20 --> 00:55:09.40
have no one to emulate that they respect. Men are dying because leaders don't care enough to lead.

532
00:55:09.40 --> 00:55:14.36
It is an Allen in particular although he's included but the real problem is that a much lower level

533
00:55:14.36 --> 00:55:19.000
at the level of the battalions and the companies. If I followed regulations I'd be recommending

534
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
courts Marshall for every last battalion commander I've seen in this brigade and I've seen them all.

535
00:55:23.64 --> 00:55:27.96
They write policy books have their men initial them and then try and correct any value

536
00:55:27.96 --> 00:55:34.76
violations they after they occur. Nobody leads by example. They command from 1500 feet up in a chopper

537
00:55:34.76 --> 00:55:40.04
then and they wear spit-shined boots like they're on parade while their men hump through the bush

538
00:55:40.04 --> 00:55:46.60
with their asses half out of their trousers. Everybody plans big but nobody sees two of

539
00:55:46.60 --> 00:55:50.92
it but that their plans are carried out. Our lieutenant colonels fight their battalions on paper

540
00:55:50.92 --> 00:56:00.44
as if they were chest pieces on a board. That's Herbert. The office was definitely quiet until he spoke.

541
00:56:01.56 --> 00:56:07.32
What do you recommend Herbert? Well since you asked kick a couple battalion commanders in the

542
00:56:07.32 --> 00:56:11.88
ass get them out of their birds and onto the ground make them spend a few nights out with their

543
00:56:11.88 --> 00:56:16.44
units and don't permit them the right to transfer the men they consider bad news force them to

544
00:56:16.44 --> 00:56:22.28
get off their asses and lead and then we'll have a brigade. That's exactly why I'm here Herbert.

545
00:56:22.28 --> 00:56:27.72
He said sir to lead. He said that's why the brigade is getting a new general to lead. General

546
00:56:27.72 --> 00:56:33.16
Pierce's damn sick of Allen and his entire hajpodge. He walked to the door.

547
00:56:33.96 --> 00:56:38.76
Things are about to change Herbert for the better. He stepped out into the darkness. I slipped the

548
00:56:38.76 --> 00:56:42.60
files back in the cabinet and sat down for a moment to think about it. Maybe he was going to make

549
00:56:42.60 --> 00:56:48.52
a difference I'm used. Maybe as Abbott had told me frankly it would be a breath of fresh air.

550
00:56:48.52 --> 00:56:52.28
So off to good start. We did a little bit of growing out. Yeah.

551
00:56:57.24 --> 00:57:03.08
Then we have Brigadier General. John W. Barnes took over the 173rd thus making a complete change

552
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:09.24
command. That as Abbott said was supposed to be it bring a breath of fresh air to that part of

553
00:57:09.24 --> 00:57:20.60
you. So then things start to go sideways. There's a little incident that goes down the next day.

554
00:57:20.60 --> 00:57:25.000
I was summoned to LZ English by Franklin the new deputy commander of the brigade.

555
00:57:26.20 --> 00:57:32.84
You're a no good disloyal son of a bitch he said for openers. What are you talking about? I asked

556
00:57:32.84 --> 00:57:37.000
you insulted one of my battalion commanders. When a year battalion commanders are repeated.

557
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.88
Yes, God damn it. Wanna mind? No sense in trying to lie out of it either because your ass is

558
00:57:41.88 --> 00:57:46.36
going to swing. I was dumbfounded until he finally explained that he had heard about the call from

559
00:57:46.36 --> 00:57:51.72
Northern to General Allen and Northern to said you suggested that call Franklin said you did it without

560
00:57:51.72 --> 00:57:56.20
permission. What do you think I should have done? I asked to come to me. That's what for what

561
00:57:56.20 --> 00:58:01.000
reason? Because I'm the commander. That's why he said and all along I thought General Barnes was the

562
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.32
new top man in the brigade. My eyes were wide but I tried to keep the emotion out of my voice.

563
00:58:05.32 --> 00:58:11.40
I knew damn well I was treading on very thin ice. You sir are not my commander. The general is.

564
00:58:12.20 --> 00:58:20.20
You can tell it's just like a bad move. He exploded and the breath of fresh air was gone forever.

565
00:58:20.20 --> 00:58:27.40
I was he said again a no good son of a bitch and a disloyal liar. I had continued true. I had

566
00:58:27.40 --> 00:58:32.52
he continued trying to sink angel and others in the brigade for my personal gain as the IG.

567
00:58:32.52 --> 00:58:36.84
General Barnes stepped out of his trailer and Franklin hailed him. General do you know

568
00:58:36.84 --> 00:58:42.52
what this Colonel of yours did he said? Shubbing his finger into my chest. The illegally warned

569
00:58:42.52 --> 00:58:49.48
General Allen of an investigation we had talked about. So things are going sideways.

570
00:58:49.48 --> 00:59:04.04
Yeah and that it was sort of the re I didn't even cover the thing that he did because it was

571
00:59:04.04 --> 00:59:11.08
like it was almost nothing. I called the Ednor Thinkton who had been Allen's aid. It was now in his

572
00:59:11.08 --> 00:59:16.84
new job and asked him if he had heard about the investigation. Is it General and Trouble? No that's

573
00:59:16.84 --> 00:59:22.76
what he did. He like basically gave a heads up and but it was like a little bit outside the chain

574
00:59:22.76 --> 00:59:31.56
of command so General or sorry Colonel Franklin freaks out. Fast forward a little bit.

575
00:59:32.44 --> 00:59:41.72
He is in Hawaii with on leave with his wife Mary Grace. Mary Grace finally asked him about

576
00:59:41.72 --> 00:59:49.16
Vietnam. A royal screw up I said your anti war Tony Herbert. No that's not what I mean. I mean I'm

577
00:59:49.16 --> 00:59:53.80
just disgusted by what I've seen happening to the army I said she looked puzzled. I had already told

578
00:59:53.80 --> 00:59:59.32
her about getting batying command and though she knew it meant that I would be more vulnerable

579
00:59:59.32 --> 01:00:05.72
to injure your death than I was and as an IG she took it as I had as she'd always taken my career.

580
01:00:05.72 --> 01:00:10.36
She was proud she said but now she looked bewildered as I talked about some of the things I had

581
01:00:10.36 --> 01:00:16.20
seen. This war is not only killing our people it's ruining our army the whole damn show is run

582
01:00:16.20 --> 01:00:22.12
without leaders and we're losing really losing. We talked the rest of the afternoon and finally she asked

583
01:00:22.12 --> 01:00:27.48
about what would happen when my Vietnam tour was finished. Wait till you hear this I said grinning

584
01:00:27.48 --> 01:00:33.48
you're gonna quit she said throwing some sand my way right Colonel Herbert wrong Mrs. Herbert.

585
01:00:33.48 --> 01:00:38.68
I've got orders for the command and command and General Staff College at 11 worth. All Tony that's great

586
01:00:38.68 --> 01:00:44.04
and after that I'm gonna try and finish my doctorate maybe then I can really contribute something to the army.

587
01:00:49.24 --> 01:00:52.68
Fast forward a little bit I kissed Mary Grayson lay back in bed staring out at the ocean

588
01:00:52.68 --> 01:00:57.88
through the glass doors at the end of our room. I thought about them all night and about the years

589
01:00:57.88 --> 01:01:04.60
that had passed and the things that had happened to all of us. Now is 1968 and I was 38 years old I

590
01:01:04.60 --> 01:01:09.000
had a wife and daughter and I had killed one hell of a lot of people and watched a lot more

591
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.04
suffer and cry and die and now Maul is gone and Pa and sister Irene.

592
01:01:17.24 --> 01:01:22.68
You are what you are you dumbass Lithuanian. I thought that night is the moon illuminated the far

593
01:01:22.68 --> 01:01:36.36
end of the room you are what you are and what you always wanted to be a soldier.

594
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.36
Get back to Vietnam and I'm just going through so much of this book what I'm just skipping so much

595
01:01:48.36 --> 01:01:53.88
there's so much detail in here about all these different things that he's dealing with. These relationships

596
01:01:53.88 --> 01:01:59.88
that he has with Colonel Franklin and General Barnes and how these things are just going sideways and

597
01:02:02.36 --> 01:02:06.84
he gets this one point take a look take a look at this and please read it all before your

598
01:02:06.84 --> 01:02:11.48
comment. Ray said handing me a file folder the investigation had been handled by major

599
01:02:12.52 --> 01:02:17.64
Henry Boyer the executive officer of second battalion. I flipped the cover sheet and turned to the

600
01:02:17.64 --> 01:02:21.80
first page of three inch by five inch color photographs dared to me. It was a picture of a

601
01:02:21.80 --> 01:02:27.56
Vietnamese male lying on his back and what appeared to be a shell creator. His face had been blown away

602
01:02:28.60 --> 01:02:33.000
in guilt beneath the picture was engraved piece on earth from the peacemakers.

603
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.88
Sea company 173rd airborne brigade or something that affect. I glanced at Ray.

604
01:02:37.88 --> 01:02:42.44
Sea company of second battalion he he he he company of second battalion he said. I turned the

605
01:02:42.44 --> 01:02:48.52
page and read it through well he said I put it down on his desk it's a cover up your damn right it's a

606
01:02:48.52 --> 01:02:53.48
cover up and little old Paul here is not going to be caught in the middle. You know what Franklin

607
01:02:53.48 --> 01:02:57.56
wants he asked without waiting for me to answer Franklin wants it swept under the rug.

608
01:02:58.12 --> 01:03:02.12
They're exactly 50 cards out like that and he wants them gathered and covered.

609
01:03:03.24 --> 01:03:07.48
And what if that's not possible? Well then I guess we just have to put the burden on Christ.

610
01:03:07.48 --> 01:03:15.32
He said referring to Captain Christ the company officer of sea company. So like it's just big

611
01:03:15.32 --> 01:03:20.84
cover up is going on. Make this go away no one everyone's worried about their career.

612
01:03:28.12 --> 01:03:34.68
All right through through all this chaos

613
01:03:34.68 --> 01:03:43.96
and he's he's been the IG at the 173rd and you don't think he's going to get a battalion

614
01:03:43.96 --> 01:03:49.32
because he's kind of created these bad relationships but he ends up getting tasks getting

615
01:03:49.32 --> 01:03:53.48
awarded getting task getting charged with taking over second battalion.

616
01:03:56.60 --> 01:03:59.96
So he's going to be working for the guy that has hated him as the IG.

617
01:03:59.96 --> 01:04:06.60
Mm-hmm. As I walked back to my sack that night I decided to use the next 24 hours prep time.

618
01:04:06.60 --> 01:04:10.04
I wanted to work out the second battalion in my mind. I laid down and began and in the

619
01:04:10.04 --> 01:04:13.32
states you might be able to go in and take your time with changes but not in Vietnam.

620
01:04:13.32 --> 01:04:16.28
In the states you could look around for a bit and maybe take a couple of weeks before

621
01:04:16.28 --> 01:04:21.64
actually making a change but in Vietnam it was a different story. Take your time in Vietnam

622
01:04:21.64 --> 01:04:27.40
and men died or lost legs or arms or eyes. So I had already been looking and thanks to my

623
01:04:27.40 --> 01:04:34.04
opportunities as an IG and and coachers help I knew about as much as anybody could know about

624
01:04:34.04 --> 01:04:39.000
the second battalion and it all blew down to one primary conclusion. Like the entire brigade

625
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.08
the second battalion was fat in every area except combat. The solution was to trim.

626
01:04:47.40 --> 01:04:53.000
He goes on about how he's going to get rid of people or move people into more combat rules

627
01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.12
because there's all these people that are not doing combat. Fast forward a little bit. I didn't

628
01:05:00.12 --> 01:05:06.52
like the way Nicholson had handled the men who were on the way home. Frequently they would come

629
01:05:06.52 --> 01:05:12.04
back to the rear as much as 30 days before they were scheduled to depart. That was a bunch of crap.

630
01:05:12.04 --> 01:05:17.64
I had learned my lesson in Korea. Rotation had been established and tigers became plussies.

631
01:05:17.64 --> 01:05:22.28
So what are you talking about there and we cover that in the lost podcast?

632
01:05:23.96 --> 01:05:28.12
In World War II when you went on deployment for the war you went on deployment for the war.

633
01:05:28.12 --> 01:05:32.92
You were going to get to go home when the war was over. In Korea is when they started hey you're

634
01:05:32.92 --> 01:05:36.60
going to deploy for six little a year. You're going to deploy for a year and then you get to go home.

635
01:05:37.72 --> 01:05:41.16
Well what does that do? Well according to him it turns tigers into plussies.

636
01:05:41.16 --> 01:05:49.40
They had hung back and played it safe until they until we wise up and came up with a new policy.

637
01:05:49.40 --> 01:05:55.000
He who fought up front went home up front. I didn't have the authority to establish that policy

638
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.20
in Vietnam but I did have the authority to decide who came back to the rear and win.

639
01:06:00.20 --> 01:06:04.44
I could make sure that a man kept his ass in the grass until seven days before his departure

640
01:06:04.44 --> 01:06:10.20
day and I was determined that the battalion would start rewarding achievement rather than failure.

641
01:06:13.32 --> 01:06:18.04
Under Nicholson the last battalion commander. If a guy wrapped a sergeant in the mouth or if he

642
01:06:18.04 --> 01:06:24.36
refused to fight he came back to the rear sat on his ass waiting drinking, seeing shows,

643
01:06:24.36 --> 01:06:30.36
smoking pot and screwing everything that wago downtown until he was court-martialed or given an

644
01:06:30.36 --> 01:06:36.04
article 15 at which point he would pay a small fine for his vacation of several weeks or months.

645
01:06:36.04 --> 01:06:41.96
Then he went back to his unit and did it again. But not with me. Every mother's son was going to

646
01:06:41.96 --> 01:06:46.76
hump it and carry his share of the load just like the few already out there.

647
01:06:48.52 --> 01:06:53.64
There were others so that's that's the secondary consequences that you got to think about or

648
01:06:53.64 --> 01:06:59.000
unintended consequences that you got to think about. Hey if echo Charles punches his platoon sergeant

649
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.76
what we're going to send him back to the rear and what's he going to do through. Get drunk.

650
01:07:04.04 --> 01:07:09.40
You know smoke pot. Get a vacation. Have to pay a small amount of money and you come back right

651
01:07:09.40 --> 01:07:13.000
out and do it again because you don't want to fight you. We're actually giving you what you want.

652
01:07:13.88 --> 01:07:20.12
Yes kind of like the kid, the teenager with the with the video he has like he gets punished and sent

653
01:07:20.12 --> 01:07:25.72
to his room but then in his room is like video games and magazines and all this stuff is phone

654
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:32.68
internet, yeah all this stuff. So he'll go you know when things get tough in real life you know go

655
01:07:32.68 --> 01:07:39.88
mo the lawn out on a whatever he'll act up get sent to his room. Yeah. Yeah. That's why the punishment,

656
01:07:39.88 --> 01:07:46.28
the modern day punishment with kids with teenagers is phone. Yeah. Take away your phone. Yeah.

657
01:07:46.28 --> 01:07:50.76
It's brutal. My kids like if I say that to my kids they're like, what?

658
01:07:50.76 --> 01:07:57.56
Right. Squarsimal way quick. You're seeing Ozark. I have not seen it. Okay. So it's like anyway

659
01:07:57.56 --> 01:08:02.84
I don't go too deep into it but basically they're they're put over simplifying it. They're running

660
01:08:02.84 --> 01:08:11.96
from these the drug cartels. So they're trying to leave. They're trying to disappear. And so it's like

661
01:08:11.96 --> 01:08:18.44
two kids. One is 12 one is like I don't know 16 17. Like girl and then the two parents. So

662
01:08:18.44 --> 01:08:22.28
the parents are like, hey we gotta go. We're changing our identities and all this stuff. So here

663
01:08:22.28 --> 01:08:27.56
give me your phone. The girl just starts flipping out. And it's kind of one of those things where,

664
01:08:27.56 --> 01:08:32.52
yeah man like some, especially kids while it depends on who you are but a lot of times kids are

665
01:08:32.52 --> 01:08:37.24
so attached to that phone. Oh yeah. Like it's such a big deal. It's the social thing like you know when

666
01:08:37.24 --> 01:08:44.04
I was a kid you know you would get grounded. Right. What you meant you couldn't see your friends.

667
01:08:44.04 --> 01:08:49.72
Yeah. You couldn't see your girlfriend. You couldn't see your bros like you were grounded.

668
01:08:50.52 --> 01:08:54.44
Well nowadays you like you said you can send the room but you're still gonna hang out with your friends

669
01:08:54.44 --> 01:08:59.16
because you're gonna be on snap. Chaps. Right. That's what's gonna be happening. Yeah. So

670
01:09:00.52 --> 01:09:03.56
sending them to a room doesn't really it's not really grounding them. The way you've ground them is

671
01:09:03.56 --> 01:09:08.84
you gotta get that device. Get that phone. There's so many kids that are mad at me right now.

672
01:09:08.84 --> 01:09:19.48
I'll put that this one. Hey what's article 15? It's if I'm your commander and you do something wrong.

673
01:09:20.76 --> 01:09:27.88
Then you can be punished under the uniform code of military justice.

674
01:09:27.88 --> 01:09:37.96
The UCMJ article 15. Article 15 means that I can dock your pay. I can reduce your rank like I can apply

675
01:09:37.96 --> 01:09:44.20
punishment to you. Now you have to opt. You can you can say you can accept

676
01:09:45.56 --> 01:09:50.76
you can accept the UCMJ or you can say I want a court martial in which case you're gonna get

677
01:09:50.76 --> 01:09:55.96
a lawyer. You're gonna get a jury and all that kind of stuff. So article 15 is going to be lesser.

678
01:09:55.96 --> 01:10:02.04
It's a little bit of a gamble sometimes depending on what you did and because you could say

679
01:10:04.04 --> 01:10:09.000
if I'm your boss and you did something wrong, people might be telling you just do just take

680
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.56
just take article 15 and you know, Joc was pretty lenient. You know he's pretty or people might be like

681
01:10:13.56 --> 01:10:16.92
you don't want to do UCMJ. You don't want to go article 15 with Joc or he crazy.

682
01:10:18.12 --> 01:10:21.32
He's gonna he's gonna fill my bucket. So it's kind of like what like a

683
01:10:21.32 --> 01:10:27.72
I guess not like a plea bargain then because you know not like a plea bargain. It's just

684
01:10:27.72 --> 01:10:34.52
accepting your fate with what your boss is gonna your boss has the authority article 15

685
01:10:34.52 --> 01:10:41.80
UCMJ to say okay echo Charles he stole a piece of gear from the platoon. We're kicking them out

686
01:10:41.80 --> 01:10:48.84
of the platoon. Well he's gonna go to UCMJ. So you go to you go to me on your boss and I say okay

687
01:10:48.84 --> 01:10:53.24
you stole gear. We're taking your try and you have to pay back the money. I'm bossing you down in

688
01:10:53.24 --> 01:10:59.56
rank and you're gonna go to the break for 30 days. There you go. Now you could let's say you didn't you

689
01:10:59.56 --> 01:11:04.52
thought you didn't steal it and you you want to make a case you could say I request court Marshall

690
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:08.36
in which case and how are we gonna court Marshall now you get a lawyer that says well he's he was just

691
01:11:08.36 --> 01:11:14.44
borrowing that gear right and everyone knows that that you're lying. So that's the kind of similarity

692
01:11:14.44 --> 01:11:20.52
to going to trial. You know all guys like no I'll take this. So in that case it is. Except for

693
01:11:21.08 --> 01:11:25.56
you don't necessarily know what the bargain is. Right so it's not like a plea bargain. It's

694
01:11:25.56 --> 01:11:31.56
just like a blind. Just a little bit of blind. It's a little bit of blind but it's sort of is

695
01:11:32.92 --> 01:11:37.80
a little bit of like hey look I know I kind of did this I'm throwing myself at the mercy of the court.

696
01:11:37.80 --> 01:11:45.08
Hey boss I screwed up I'm sorry hit me yeah like pleading guilty essentially you know my

697
01:11:45.08 --> 01:11:49.48
inner kind of way because the you know that you're kind of yep it's up to the judge I was like okay

698
01:11:49.48 --> 01:11:52.76
you're putting it in your phone your kind of that kind of stuff out the mercy the court.

699
01:11:53.80 --> 01:11:59.32
That's the 15. What is forgive me by the way I'm demediating what didn't you and I've heard this

700
01:11:59.32 --> 01:12:02.28
here you guys say this all the time taking your tried and what does that mean you're not in

701
01:12:02.28 --> 01:12:06.60
maybe see anymore. Yeah just straight up you can't get it back. You can't go through the whole deal.

702
01:12:06.60 --> 01:12:14.44
Yep. Yep. That's kind of everything right? Not kind of. That's everything but you're still in the

703
01:12:14.44 --> 01:12:18.52
name you though. You can still be in the name you know but that's not your jam if you're a seal typically.

704
01:12:18.52 --> 01:12:26.60
Yeah it's not your jam I remember there was a guy that stole a pair of sunglasses from

705
01:12:26.60 --> 01:12:36.36
like another guy. Yep. They had his they had a capins mask the next day for a little

706
01:12:36.92 --> 01:12:43.000
article 15 took his bird he was gone like that how's it always pretty new guy because if you

707
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.68
are a thief in the team's yeah it's brutal you you are gonna get you are gonna get crushed like you

708
01:12:50.68 --> 01:12:55.48
will get there's there's you can leave anything out in the seal teams you can leave a freaking

709
01:12:55.48 --> 01:13:03.56
diamond uh uh in crusted knife yeah and no one will touch it in the team. You don't know we don't

710
01:13:03.56 --> 01:13:09.000
steal anything in the team's. Yeah and that makes sense I mean especially like such when you're like a

711
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.16
cohesive or supposed to be cohesive team you know. Oh yeah you're gonna steal something yeah that's

712
01:13:15.16 --> 01:13:21.96
like nuts. He's still still still he sunglasses too I mean day. Oh I know especially when you

713
01:13:21.96 --> 01:13:26.12
get issued sunglasses hey supply guy I need new sunglasses and I don't even know what all the

714
01:13:26.68 --> 01:13:30.68
circumstances were behind it because let's face it we all have Oakley's back. Yeah

715
01:13:31.88 --> 01:13:36.36
can you do we're all wearing the same sunglasses so I don't know if I do had some engraving on there

716
01:13:36.36 --> 01:13:41.80
or scratch his name into it whatever but man this guy was gone and that makes even less sense when

717
01:13:41.80 --> 01:13:44.92
you think about it because it's not like you're not gonna wear him when you're gonna do just

718
01:13:44.92 --> 01:13:48.68
steal him and put him in your house under your pillow or something like this you're gonna be wearing

719
01:13:48.68 --> 01:13:52.68
them around. Who knows maybe there was other things that I didn't know about I was a new guy I didn't

720
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:59.000
know anything there's like hey don't steal shit I'm like cool god it's not like we're not stealing

721
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.88
in the zoo things if freaking pissed me off on time when I went to my first ship board deployment

722
01:14:04.60 --> 01:14:12.04
and a guy stole I had my gear out and a guy stole a knife. They wasn't from my

723
01:14:12.04 --> 01:14:16.28
petune but it's just somebody on the ship maybe it was a marine maybe it was a navy guy I don't know

724
01:14:16.28 --> 01:14:20.92
oh you didn't find them no we never found them but same thing like what's this guy gonna do he's

725
01:14:20.92 --> 01:14:26.04
gonna hide that knife and then take it home and put it under his pillow like he's not gonna be

726
01:14:26.04 --> 01:14:33.16
able to use it because we'll see him and then we'll throw him off the ship. Yeah man yeah and that makes

727
01:14:33.16 --> 01:14:38.20
it even here about a guy stealing from someone else on the team it's like bro yeah you're

728
01:14:38.20 --> 01:14:42.60
known to mess around that guy anymore the probably had a guy's name I forget his name

729
01:14:42.60 --> 01:14:47.64
he stole a video game systems like a super Nintendo or something like that from one of the

730
01:14:47.64 --> 01:14:53.80
guys in the dorms on the football team both of them and they were like it was weird because yeah my

731
01:14:53.80 --> 01:14:59.40
friend the name's Dave he's the one who got it stolen from he was like looking around for

732
01:14:59.40 --> 01:15:03.08
he's like you know you're just confused it's not like something kind of steal your whole video

733
01:15:03.08 --> 01:15:07.48
okay I do your dorm room and he lives in the same dorm too so it's like it's like what do you

734
01:15:07.48 --> 01:15:12.36
set it up for doors down that's what I'm saying so it was just gone so he was confused and then

735
01:15:12.36 --> 01:15:17.000
after what's like no someone stole this you know so they you know they went through the thing and

736
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.60
they were like dusting for prints which was like you know that doesn't matter because everyone

737
01:15:20.60 --> 01:15:25.64
comes in and out of the dorm so it just doesn't didn't even matter but I think Davey was suspicious

738
01:15:25.64 --> 01:15:30.68
of this guy I don't know if he became suspicious or he was already suspicious so he was so

739
01:15:30.68 --> 01:15:37.56
he was so he was so he went to his room and just was like you know what I'm gonna get to the

740
01:15:37.56 --> 01:15:41.000
bottom of this thing and he was like asking him he was like what are you talking about on that

741
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.04
or whatever became his big thing and then he looked and in the dorms there's these beds right

742
01:15:46.04 --> 01:15:50.76
the beds are like that and you can like take there's like a drawer under the bed and all this stuff

743
01:15:50.76 --> 01:15:58.28
right you know everything got a fit uh got a fit in the door so he pulled out the drawer of the bed

744
01:15:58.28 --> 01:16:03.56
and like took you know you can take out the drawer so he unhooked it and like took it out and

745
01:16:03.56 --> 01:16:09.80
blown there it was Davey did that Davey did that too yeah the guys it was a call out essentially but

746
01:16:09.80 --> 01:16:13.16
you know when you call somebody out you better get the stuff because you know look dumb you

747
01:16:13.16 --> 01:16:19.40
must have been super suspect then yeah he was like because that's weird too imagine accusing someone

748
01:16:19.40 --> 01:16:25.96
right yeah but also you can kind of tell oh yeah I am looking at someone you can tell yeah and consider

749
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.96
it's really not all the freaking lies yeah and usually but and consider even I mean I'm sure

750
01:16:33.96 --> 01:16:39.96
it's like this in the military too where you kind of consider who could or had the opportunity or

751
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:43.96
whatever and if they did what would they have done it's like oh they could keep it in front of

752
01:16:43.96 --> 01:16:48.36
you if they can practice the other day and I come all of them on my shit's gone exactly right yeah

753
01:16:48.36 --> 01:16:53.08
so I think there's that kind of going on as well and then we had some circumstantial evidence

754
01:16:53.08 --> 01:16:58.84
then he read his face and probably so they arrest them straight up everyone was like oh my

755
01:16:58.84 --> 01:17:04.12
I can't believe this even happened like why would you do that it just wasn't computing for a lot of us

756
01:17:04.12 --> 01:17:08.60
and boom they arrested me using jail so this guy I remember his name I don't want to call him

757
01:17:08.60 --> 01:17:14.76
out to me but he uh so he calls the coach like you know you know when you're in college let's face it

758
01:17:14.76 --> 01:17:19.80
like you get into some sort of thing you say hey coach I'm in this thing like what can we do to

759
01:17:19.80 --> 01:17:25.48
sort of you know I hope to work it out so he calls the coach and he's like hey this is what

760
01:17:25.48 --> 01:17:29.40
happened I mean jail I think you need to get bail out because he didn't live in Hawaii he was from the

761
01:17:29.40 --> 01:17:35.08
from the mainland so it's like you know it's hard because anyway he calls the coach and the coach

762
01:17:35.08 --> 01:17:41.56
you know he's disturbing those rod in there okay that's what I like to do I gotta say

763
01:17:41.56 --> 01:17:46.92
that's what I like to do yeah don't like thieves no don't be stealing don't steal

764
01:17:48.92 --> 01:17:52.20
otherwise you're gonna get UCMJ article 15 alright

765
01:17:52.20 --> 01:17:58.36
um going back to the book here there were other things running through my mind that night

766
01:17:58.36 --> 01:18:04.52
tactics for instance the infantry maximum was just a slogan and I wanted it to be in practice

767
01:18:05.16 --> 01:18:12.04
find them fix them fight them and finish them but it simply wasn't being used I wanted to change

768
01:18:12.04 --> 01:18:17.32
that find them use reconnaissance and intelligence the reconnaissance platoon is being used as a special

769
01:18:17.32 --> 01:18:22.28
ambush unit rather than for reconnaissance the battalion had to have eyes and ears it's area of

770
01:18:22.28 --> 01:18:27.72
operations was bordered on the east by the south china scene and on the what south china c

771
01:18:27.72 --> 01:18:31.88
and on the west by string of mountains running north and south from those ridges a trooper with

772
01:18:31.88 --> 01:18:38.60
binoculars could see in most cases all the way to the sea but it wasn't being used fix them fire

773
01:18:38.60 --> 01:18:44.44
and maneuver one pins them down with fire while the other runs up around the rocks and comes in

774
01:18:44.44 --> 01:18:52.44
from the flanker from the behind fire maneuver have always been the key to infantry success

775
01:18:54.92 --> 01:19:00.20
but in Vietnam we were just calling in artillery and backing off the way the next day we would

776
01:19:00.20 --> 01:19:04.04
go and pick up the pieces in generally there weren't any except for the women and kids who hadn't

777
01:19:04.04 --> 01:19:08.84
had the sense to make it out of the area fight them close with and destroy the enemy the military

778
01:19:08.84 --> 01:19:13.64
enemy killed them or capture them but and emphasize prisoners because they give information

779
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:19.08
that leads to more prisoners dead men are just dead men capture them if possible but if not

780
01:19:19.08 --> 01:19:24.60
finish them off for good i lay there in my sack that night trying to put it all together in my mind

781
01:19:24.60 --> 01:19:29.64
where i had been and what i had done and how i got to where i was at that very moment in time

782
01:19:29.64 --> 01:19:36.44
and space i was alive i decided because of two things sheer luck and not forgetting i attributed

783
01:19:36.44 --> 01:19:42.20
to nothing else but i knew that the presence of mine had a great deal to do with one's fortunes

784
01:19:42.20 --> 01:19:47.48
i also knew there were some things beyond anybody's control they just happened regardless of

785
01:19:47.48 --> 01:19:52.52
planning or preparation or skill or courage or cowardice i went to sleep thinking about all that

786
01:19:52.52 --> 01:19:57.88
the next day i poured over my batalion plans again and when i hit the sack the next night

787
01:19:57.88 --> 01:20:07.80
i knew i was ready as i'd ever been i slept well so i'm gonna jump through some of this

788
01:20:07.80 --> 01:20:12.52
stuff right now this is where he starts he takes over the batalion he starts squaring things away he starts

789
01:20:12.52 --> 01:20:19.32
going on operations he's still having it's not an overnight process not like the batalion oh there's

790
01:20:19.32 --> 01:20:25.56
new commander like we're good to go now everything's perfect it's not like that um and as he's

791
01:20:25.56 --> 01:20:30.44
starting to dig into the he's going on some ops he's starting to dig into trying to find out how to get the

792
01:20:30.44 --> 01:20:39.000
he get the platoon's moving in the right direction um he's got he sits down to talk to one of one of

793
01:20:39.80 --> 01:20:44.44
these latinits he's talking to the sleutannet and the lieutenant kind of he this lieutenant doesn't want

794
01:20:44.44 --> 01:20:49.56
to go in the field doesn't want to go in the field and he's trying to figure out why and the

795
01:20:49.56 --> 01:20:55.88
lieutenant says you know not with this particular leader and he says why not and he's kind of

796
01:20:55.88 --> 01:21:00.12
doesn't want to say anything he's finally says tell me and he and then he says he opened up he had been a

797
01:21:00.12 --> 01:21:05.32
platoon leader and his group had police up a detainee from a village that had reported the details to

798
01:21:05.32 --> 01:21:11.56
a CEO over the company net the platoon had began to tie up the the detainee for extraction

799
01:21:11.56 --> 01:21:18.36
when the co called back the lieutenant told me the co said what they had out there was a kia

800
01:21:18.36 --> 01:21:24.76
a dead dink a body count of one to which the lieutenant replied that he did not have a dead person but a

801
01:21:24.76 --> 01:21:32.68
detainee and reasonably good health so he says no what we have is a dead dink killed trying to get

802
01:21:32.68 --> 01:21:39.000
away the lieutenant continued so what did you say I asked well I told him the guy might be a civilian

803
01:21:39.64 --> 01:21:45.40
and what did he say he said that wasn't hardly possible because once he's dead he's a dink

804
01:21:46.60 --> 01:21:51.40
which in fact was about the only way it was played in Vietnam regardless of what a person might have

805
01:21:51.40 --> 01:21:58.20
been before he was killed afterwards he was a dink very very damn few people ever reported

806
01:21:58.20 --> 01:22:03.72
killing a civilian regardless of how unavoidable the death might have been and very damn few dead

807
01:22:03.72 --> 01:22:09.000
civilians failed to be included in body counts it was time to stop the lieutenant though before

808
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.24
his narrative went beyond the point of no return I held up my hand hold you do you understand

809
01:22:15.24 --> 01:22:19.56
did that make sense because I know I jumped in the story so basically this young lieutenant is there

810
01:22:19.56 --> 01:22:25.88
they have a detainee that they've captured and he calls his company commander and says hey company commander

811
01:22:25.88 --> 01:22:30.92
I got a I got a captured individual I got a detainee you know what do you want me to do

812
01:22:30.92 --> 01:22:35.24
and the the commanding officer calls back and says you don't have a detainee you have a killed an action

813
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.84
and you know that the the term dink obviously this is a slur and but it it doesn't just mean it means

814
01:22:44.84 --> 01:22:51.000
enemy that's what they're saying if you kill someone they're enemy with so he's he implying that you

815
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.20
should he should kill him yep yeah and he's about that's what he's he's about to get to that part

816
01:22:56.20 --> 01:23:03.40
and and Colonel Herbert says hold on and he he says hold it I cautioned him sir look before you get too

817
01:23:03.40 --> 01:23:07.96
far there are some other questions but first you have to realize that if you say what I think you may be

818
01:23:07.96 --> 01:23:13.56
going to say I'm gonna have to report it therefore it's only fair in fact by the regulation in

819
01:23:13.56 --> 01:23:18.60
fact it's required by regulations and the UCMJ that I make you aware of your rights do you understand

820
01:23:19.32 --> 01:23:25.40
yes sir well then let me ask you this do you understand your rights under article 31 yes sir I do well

821
01:23:25.40 --> 01:23:31.40
let me go over them again for you anyways you don't have to say anything anything that you say can be

822
01:23:31.40 --> 01:23:36.28
used in court you can stop right now or or you can continue or you can have a military council right

823
01:23:36.28 --> 01:23:42.04
here while you do talk if you wish and that's an that's it in a nutshell now do you want to go on

824
01:23:42.04 --> 01:23:48.52
since I've gone this far for Christ's sake lieutenant at least think before you answer my next question okay

825
01:23:49.88 --> 01:23:57.96
okay was the execution in fact carried out yes sir it was now lieutenant here comes the big one

826
01:23:57.96 --> 01:24:03.32
and let me stay it again that you neither have to answer nor you expected to answer just because I'm your commander

827
01:24:03.88 --> 01:24:09.80
if it's going to incriminate you I want you to understand that part for sure do you yes sir I do

828
01:24:09.80 --> 01:24:16.52
all right then who actually did the killing he started to answer and then stop the abruptly

829
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:20.84
abruptly sir I prefer not to answer that one right now if it's okay with you that's your

830
01:24:20.84 --> 01:24:25.40
prerogative you keep this to yourself until I get back to you do you want to put it in writing

831
01:24:25.40 --> 01:24:31.32
I think that I think I'd better do that good he said I said handing him a pad bring it back

832
01:24:31.32 --> 01:24:48.68
when you finished and forget about going out and see company right now it can wait so obviously bad situation

833
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:55.16
he starts to run it up the chain a command who's that include Franklin what does Franklin say

834
01:24:55.16 --> 01:24:59.16
what the hell kind of commander are you he asked it's none of your business what occurred before

835
01:24:59.16 --> 01:25:06.92
you assumed command I'll back it up with an investigation I said there'll be no investigation

836
01:25:08.52 --> 01:25:15.000
says Franklin it's required sir I got damn it Herbert I'll handle it I said I'll handle it and I will

837
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.52
if anything is done it will be done with the general's approval and it will be done by me can you

838
01:25:20.52 --> 01:25:26.20
understand that much I understand sir do you want to statement from major boyer I want nothing

839
01:25:26.20 --> 01:25:29.08
until I'm ready which means I don't want anyone discussing it either

840
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:37.24
that

841
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.72
so while he's dealing with all this and while he's continuing to create friction and again there's

842
01:25:49.72 --> 01:25:55.08
so much of this and there's so much in this book so many good lessons here's here's a lesson

843
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:59.72
he's talking about planning and how he planned because he's still leading troops he's still

844
01:25:59.72 --> 01:26:05.88
they're still doing all kinds of operations he says this to his troops I want you all to come

845
01:26:05.88 --> 01:26:11.08
up with the plans and recommendations I told them and I meant it hell I didn't profess to be an

846
01:26:11.08 --> 01:26:16.92
expert in anything and by the way if you're a leader just write this whole thing down I didn't

847
01:26:16.92 --> 01:26:22.92
profess to be an expert in anything I was the dumb son of a fine coal miner and I could use

848
01:26:22.92 --> 01:26:28.60
all the help I could get if anybody came up with a brainstorm I damn sure wanted to hear about it

849
01:26:29.24 --> 01:26:34.44
and that includes suggestions for a commander raid on Hanauoi from Doctali I concluded

850
01:26:35.24 --> 01:26:42.60
I really wanted to listen to them because if a man makes a contribution to a plan he has a material

851
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:49.96
interest in making it succeed so the trick is to forget about taking credit for ideas and to persuade

852
01:26:49.96 --> 01:27:01.16
others that they are their own take notes I talk about that very thing all the time

853
01:27:04.36 --> 01:27:10.04
he also says I thought out everything and tried not to waste words or time frequently may have

854
01:27:10.04 --> 01:27:15.56
appeared to have been spur of the moment response but it was generally prepared even though they were

855
01:27:15.56 --> 01:27:21.48
volunteers as all paratroopers are the grunts were different the grunts were by nature different

856
01:27:22.20 --> 01:27:26.76
they were not career men in the same sense that officers and most of the senior NCOs were

857
01:27:26.76 --> 01:27:31.56
career men and they were not sensitive to opportunities for promotion or self a grand

858
01:27:31.56 --> 01:27:37.64
diesmen but because individuals are aggressive and competitive by nature the grunts did require an

859
01:27:37.64 --> 01:27:44.44
opportunity to express those instincts or in a word a chance to operate I knew the grunt hell I was

860
01:27:44.44 --> 01:27:50.84
one of them promoted grunt to be sure but still a grunt I'd been an enlisted man over half my entire

861
01:27:50.84 --> 01:27:55.88
career I had fought as one and been wounded as one and I understood what made a grunt tick because

862
01:27:55.88 --> 01:28:02.60
I knew what made me tick I'd also been fortunate enough to gather enough psychological insight

863
01:28:02.60 --> 01:28:08.20
to comprehend them and myself even more deeply and thoroughly at the same time gaining enough military

864
01:28:08.20 --> 01:28:13.72
experience to recognize that they were the best raw material in the world they were bigger and

865
01:28:13.72 --> 01:28:18.60
healthier and more intelligent and better educated than any soldier the US army had ever had the

866
01:28:18.60 --> 01:28:24.36
opportunity to use before and they were superior to any soldier any other country was getting

867
01:28:25.40 --> 01:28:31.40
even with our training shortcomings and there were by god plentiful the grunts and Vietnam were

868
01:28:31.40 --> 01:28:37.08
still the best trained men around as well as the best fed and best equipped more over I think I

869
01:28:37.08 --> 01:28:43.16
recognize something that must have slipped by most of the brass including Westmoreland and later Abrams

870
01:28:43.16 --> 01:28:47.72
that the length of the hair on a man's head wasn't nearly as important as the caliber of the

871
01:28:47.72 --> 01:28:57.08
brain inside I knew that the grunt was a man just like me and that he was entitled to the same

872
01:28:57.08 --> 01:29:06.68
respect I myself demanded his dignity was sacred it could never be changed the commander could

873
01:29:06.68 --> 01:29:12.60
scream and rant and rage and curse like a sailor but he could never encroach on the troopers dignity.

874
01:29:14.12 --> 01:29:19.56
If the leader attacks his troopers dignity the trooper has but two alternatives to fold up

875
01:29:19.56 --> 01:29:25.40
roll over and die or strike back I was determined to follow the pattern that had worked for me in the

876
01:29:25.40 --> 01:29:31.000
past to allow my men to make at least as many of the same kind of mistakes as I had made and god

877
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:38.20
knows I had made my share and more to deal with them honestly to to express admiration respect love

878
01:29:38.20 --> 01:29:45.08
patriotism and my own conviction that he represented with all my faults with all its faults the

879
01:29:45.08 --> 01:29:50.84
greatest country in the history of civilization and the mightiest combat arm this universe ever

880
01:29:50.84 --> 01:29:56.44
assembled under a single power to persuade him that it not really been equipment and mass production

881
01:29:56.44 --> 01:30:04.60
in a one world war one world war two in Korea for us but rather blood guts courage know how and a

882
01:30:04.60 --> 01:30:06.84
steadfast devotion to a cause.

883
01:30:16.52 --> 01:30:17.88
Respect to your people.

884
01:30:17.88 --> 01:30:28.20
I laid out the strategy for my battalion it was some lousy war when a piddling battalion commander

885
01:30:28.20 --> 01:30:32.92
had to lay out a master strategy but that's the way it was hell nobody else laid out anything

886
01:30:32.92 --> 01:30:38.20
for these men either from a national or an international perspective I ordered to them to give them

887
01:30:38.20 --> 01:30:43.96
some kind of purpose and a reason at the battalion level at least got to know why you're doing

888
01:30:43.96 --> 01:30:51.64
and what you're doing and he's saying they're not even hearing that fast forward a little bit

889
01:30:51.64 --> 01:30:57.96
in fact the whole damn US army in Vietnam was crazy the generals west moreland Abrams pierced

890
01:30:57.96 --> 01:31:05.56
Ross and depue Richardson you will ramsey and the rest were all working on the premise that

891
01:31:05.56 --> 01:31:09.88
they were the best in that whatever problems we were having were the fault of the commanders at

892
01:31:09.88 --> 01:31:15.16
lower levels.

893
01:31:15.16 --> 01:31:17.80
Bullshit.

894
01:31:17.80 --> 01:31:22.12
The major leadership problem in Vietnam was the generals and the rest of the senior officer

895
01:31:22.12 --> 01:31:27.16
corps the colonels the lieutenant colonels and the majors the captains the tenets and list

896
01:31:27.16 --> 01:31:32.84
men weren't to blame the generals were has bins or never bends from world war two vintage

897
01:31:32.84 --> 01:31:46.68
who had paper images built up by the public information people so again you know we're we're

898
01:31:46.68 --> 01:31:53.32
reading this book and really he's placing the blame on everybody else which is not good

899
01:31:54.44 --> 01:31:57.56
but he's telling what it looks like from his perspective.

900
01:31:57.56 --> 01:32:03.40
He says about those generals they walked and talked like leaders in war ribbons and

901
01:32:03.40 --> 01:32:07.64
uniform so it was only reasonable that back in Washington they were regarded as leaders and we're

902
01:32:07.64 --> 01:32:09.64
listened to.

903
01:32:10.84 --> 01:32:16.44
If you were in the military you must be a great leader right we still have that anybody that was

904
01:32:16.44 --> 01:32:18.04
in the military must be a great leader.

905
01:32:18.04 --> 01:32:28.84
So I wish it was true it's not always true unfortunately.

906
01:32:31.72 --> 01:32:39.000
Again he wasn't just talking he's guys not just a talker this guy is not when he's talking

907
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.52
smack about these other leaders he's not just talking smack and and say no they're not leading

908
01:32:44.52 --> 01:32:50.28
he's leading he's actually leading there's all kinds of stories in here here's one I cross the

909
01:32:50.28 --> 01:32:53.80
yard there out on the mission across the yard to the bunker and nail myself up against it's

910
01:32:53.80 --> 01:32:54.84
outer-redge.

911
01:32:54.84 --> 01:32:59.88
Chewhoe I shouted using the name of the program we had set up for leniency and return for immediate

912
01:32:59.88 --> 01:33:01.40
unresisting surrender.

913
01:33:01.40 --> 01:33:06.52
Chewhoe as always there was no response I waited then stepped back and fired two quick rounds

914
01:33:06.52 --> 01:33:10.84
into the sandbags around the doorway then stepping back against the wall I lifted a grenade

915
01:33:10.84 --> 01:33:15.96
from my belt the old woman on the porch screamed and there was one hell of a scuffling inside the

916
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:17.88
bronzer bunker.

917
01:33:17.88 --> 01:33:23.48
They tripped all over each other coming out hands first two hoi two hoi me two hoi two hoi they

918
01:33:23.48 --> 01:33:27.96
were shouting I figured you were I mumbled to myself there were three of them two in

919
01:33:27.96 --> 01:33:31.72
khakis and the wounded guy stripped down to his shorts.

920
01:33:31.72 --> 01:33:35.80
I nudged them toward warden keep them covered I said I'll get the bunker I'll get it

921
01:33:35.80 --> 01:33:41.56
searched midi said trotting across toward me God dammit keep that group covered I shouted I'll get

922
01:33:41.56 --> 01:33:46.44
the damn damned bunker we all get paid by the same people.

923
01:33:46.44 --> 01:33:51.64
I don't think it was bravado it was just that I had learned years before that if you wanted to be

924
01:33:51.64 --> 01:33:56.20
followed then you had to get your house out and lead by setting the example.

925
01:33:56.20 --> 01:34:00.60
If I expected other people to go down inside bunkers and holes after the enemy then I had better

926
01:34:00.60 --> 01:34:06.20
be ready to do it myself this time it was my turn I kept my rifle in front.

927
01:34:09.40 --> 01:34:14.44
Someone shouted grenade and the others hit the dirt I dropped them one knee holding my head down

928
01:34:14.44 --> 01:34:19.08
low in front of my shoulders I saw the guy break out of the bushing out of the bush with another

929
01:34:19.08 --> 01:34:23.64
grenade in his hands I squeezed twice on the trigger and watched the rounds slam his two is chest

930
01:34:23.64 --> 01:34:28.68
driving him up against one of the palms bouncing him off into the bushes two of our men had been hit

931
01:34:28.68 --> 01:34:34.36
by the explosion I didn't remember even hearing their grenade detonate except vaguely perhaps that's

932
01:34:34.36 --> 01:34:39.64
how unimportant grenades were for me at least I'd seen them all over the world and had used

933
01:34:39.64 --> 01:34:46.04
them and had them used against me over and over I did not respect them as a weapon they were charges

934
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:50.84
they blew up and out lay one an arms length stay down flat and the worst you would do

935
01:34:52.04 --> 01:34:58.36
was give you a concussion run and you got some shrapnel in your ass watch him I said and turn to

936
01:34:58.36 --> 01:35:03.64
the ray that grenade came from the building you take that side and I'll take this one I turned the

937
01:35:03.64 --> 01:35:10.68
muzzle of the M16 west and followed it around the building I heard the ray fire just then a grenade

938
01:35:10.68 --> 01:35:15.56
exploded and I got the building just in time to see the ray kicking away the reads and dragging

939
01:35:15.56 --> 01:35:21.000
the body from between the false walls the guy had been wedged into a section about the size of a bird

940
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.64
cage the red nudged the bloody the bloody body with his foot a loser sir he said quietly gently

941
01:35:27.64 --> 01:35:32.36
with that same catch in his voice that you hear in the movies just before tears a god damn loser

942
01:35:32.36 --> 01:35:38.44
dink he rolled it over gently the guy had been a real trooper and he had tried to do just as he

943
01:35:38.44 --> 01:35:44.04
had been told just as so many of our kids had been told and would have tried had they been in his place

944
01:35:45.24 --> 01:35:50.92
uncle hoe would never even know the poor bastard was dead nor would he have given a shit if he had

945
01:35:50.92 --> 01:35:57.000
known like those on our side he was just another statistic we left him there in the dirt

946
01:36:04.84 --> 01:36:10.44
we started back down the trail at a truck and outright run was out of the question because

947
01:36:10.44 --> 01:36:15.40
more than likely if you broke out of the bush running you were a dead ass even at our speed it was

948
01:36:15.40 --> 01:36:19.96
more than a few seconds before we reach a large grassy clearing the american lieutenant

949
01:36:19.96 --> 01:36:26.12
the advisor was on my left as we entered the clearing and the rest of were standing around in

950
01:36:26.12 --> 01:36:33.96
no particular formation across the clearing I saw one man a Vietnamese holding the young girl's

951
01:36:33.96 --> 01:36:41.72
hair with his left hand bending her head back bearing her throat his right arm was around her neck

952
01:36:41.72 --> 01:36:47.32
and a knife in his right hand was dug deeply into her flesh beneath and to the left of her

953
01:36:47.32 --> 01:36:55.72
softfrogus all he had to do was pull and she was gone one of the children was hanging onto her

954
01:36:55.72 --> 01:37:02.04
pajamas screaming and the other child's face was being steadily squashed into the sand by the foot

955
01:37:02.04 --> 01:37:09.80
of another Vietnamese soldier the child was suffocating I shoved the american lieutenant out of the way

956
01:37:09.80 --> 01:37:19.88
and shouted something staring at the guy with the knife in the girls throat he was staring at me too

957
01:37:19.88 --> 01:37:24.36
these Vietnamese these are South Vietnamese soldiers and this the first person that he pushed out of the

958
01:37:24.36 --> 01:37:35.64
way was a was an american advisor so he comes on this scene in this in this clearing and there's

959
01:37:35.64 --> 01:37:40.28
an american lieutenant he pushes that guy out of the way and these Vietnamese soldiers that the american

960
01:37:40.28 --> 01:37:45.80
lieutenant was an advisor to all this is happening so these are these are South Vietnamese soldiers

961
01:37:45.80 --> 01:37:50.52
with the with the young girls we have pulled them to hold the knife to this young girls throat so

962
01:37:50.52 --> 01:38:01.88
this is a ally so this Vietnamese soldiers staring at herber with the knife to the girls throat

963
01:38:01.88 --> 01:38:09.08
back to the book with great ease he pulled the blade across her blood spirited and gushed down

964
01:38:09.08 --> 01:38:14.68
the front of her pajamas and she dropped to the darkening sand pulling the child with her it took

965
01:38:14.68 --> 01:38:19.16
no more than a second from the instant he moved the knife until she crumpled in a lifeless

966
01:38:19.16 --> 01:38:24.36
heat per baby still screaming still plying at her legs her killer jumped back in the group of

967
01:38:24.36 --> 01:38:29.24
Vietnamese pulling with him the guy who'd been suffocating the child I should have shot them on the

968
01:38:29.24 --> 01:38:35.32
spot while I could still identify them the rest of the detainees were lined up against the bushes

969
01:38:35.32 --> 01:38:40.92
four of the men were already dead lying off in the grass to my right with their heads blown away

970
01:38:40.92 --> 01:38:45.80
a Vietnamese soldier was parading up and down in front of the survivors waving a pistol

971
01:38:46.60 --> 01:38:50.84
I noticed that one of the four dead men was the stud we had captured in the hut

972
01:38:52.28 --> 01:38:58.52
I felt myself go empty something dreamed from me in that moment that you that I have yet to replace

973
01:38:58.52 --> 01:39:03.08
you dumb son of a bitch I screamed grabbing the american lieutenant by the by his shirt

974
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:10.44
in that instant I was only a flick away from killing him it passed I calmed and turned him loose

975
01:39:10.44 --> 01:39:15.24
just what the hell did you let happen here lieutenant he was only an advisor he said

976
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:21.08
there they were only doing a job they knew their business guerrillas weren't protected under the

977
01:39:21.08 --> 01:39:28.20
Geneva Accords they were following orders oh god I thought a big badass to american

978
01:39:28.20 --> 01:39:32.28
who had never killed anyone in combat or captured a single prisoner legitimately had played hell

979
01:39:32.28 --> 01:39:38.36
with these poor devils big badass to all american boy god I was frustrated I raised my hand to

980
01:39:38.36 --> 01:39:44.60
slap him clear across the area I lowered it you get all your scrap together and then get the hell

981
01:39:44.60 --> 01:39:49.40
out of here I screamed at him so I have a job I glanced down at the four dead men and over to the

982
01:39:49.40 --> 01:39:54.60
woman's body not anymore you don't lieutenant he was staring at me with what seemed to be disbelief

983
01:39:54.60 --> 01:39:59.80
I moved his near to him as possible without touching now get your people out of here out of here

984
01:39:59.80 --> 01:40:06.76
I said quietly and calmly you're finished here the rest of this like the charges will take care

985
01:40:06.76 --> 01:40:17.48
back at base so he witnesses this this this this atrocity and gets back to base

986
01:40:17.48 --> 01:40:29.16
runs it up the chain of command tells to frankly Franklin frankly Franklin he tells Franklin what happens

987
01:40:31.40 --> 01:40:35.48
Franklin finally asked what had happened and I told him every last sword detail right down to the blood

988
01:40:35.48 --> 01:40:41.96
leaping from the girls throat Herbert you're a goddamn liar he said I sure to my wasn't lying there are other

991
01:40:57.08 --> 01:41:02.44

992
01:41:02.44 --> 01:41:07.48

994
01:41:24.36 --> 01:41:30.12
a day or two so so they start going through and this is what's really interesting about this book is they have

995
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:38.28
like the the actual documents from this guy Warden I started in first class Warden

996
01:41:38.28 --> 01:41:44.52
during the period of 14 February that's Valentine's Day 1969 was a platoon sergeant for so he explains

997
01:41:44.52 --> 01:41:54.60
what he saw happen and you can get this book and read those documents then this happens a

998
01:41:54.60 --> 01:42:00.04
day or two after the St. Valentine's Day massacre which we just read about a black trooper named white

999
01:42:00.04 --> 01:42:06.20
refused to go into the field and offered his refusal loud and clear out in the battalion street where he

1000
01:42:06.20 --> 01:42:11.80
could be heard by one and all you're going out white just like everybody else I told him

1001
01:42:12.60 --> 01:42:17.72
like hell I am you son of a bitch I ain't fighting for no whiteies right white

1002

1003
01:42:23.56 --> 01:42:29.08
but by god you're going like hell I am he said taking off his glasses and slamming them against the

1004
01:42:29.08 --> 01:42:34.84
ground they were unbroken he stepped on them and ground them into tiny pieces now you bastard he said

1005

1010
01:43:03.40 --> 01:43:09.72
bronze star and even if you don't I'll see to it that you get a purple heart out there when you're on

1011
01:43:09.72 --> 01:43:18.04
your own your anybody's and everybody's meet if Vc or NVA don't get you the locals will you are

1012
01:43:18.04 --> 01:43:23.72
money and they're all bounty hunters I'll cut out as soon as I get back then know you won't

1013
01:43:23.72 --> 01:43:28.76
because you either straighten out here either straight now out out there or when the company returns

1014
01:43:28.76 --> 01:43:33.64
you'll be transferred to a unit that replaces them you reached into his shirt pocket and pulled

1015
01:43:33.64 --> 01:43:39.80
out another pair of glasses he was swaggering away he swaggering as he walked away toward the helicopter

1016
01:43:40.84 --> 01:43:43.56
big guy big bad guy you'll get yours baby

1017
01:43:46.68 --> 01:43:51.96
the best I could do is hope that the best I could hope for would be that he would do a good job it

1018
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:56.60
was his only chance if he didn't cut it he was going back out with the next unit just as I had promised

1019
01:43:57.16 --> 01:44:04.04
it was the only way reward the right response and do everything you can to get it most of time it

1020
01:44:04.04 --> 01:44:13.08
worked with white it didn't so just to kind of debrief that we heard earlier about his policies

1021
01:44:13.08 --> 01:44:18.60
he doesn't want to punish people for acting badly so if this guy with his old Italian commander acted

1022
01:44:18.60 --> 01:44:24.44
this way he'd get okay you're you're in trouble you need you need to go stay in the barracks

1023
01:44:25.16 --> 01:44:29.96
and you're going to go to you see MJ and whatever but he's not going to go fight which is what

1024
01:44:29.96 --> 01:44:36.44
he actually wanted so his deal is not only are you going to go fight but if you don't do a good job

1025
01:44:36.92 --> 01:44:41.48
when this when this platoon gets back from this mission you're going out with the next platoon

1026
01:44:41.48 --> 01:44:52.60
until you do a freaking good job he performed poorly in the field just as he vowed he would

1027
01:44:52.60 --> 01:44:55.56
and I had him held at the gate when his unit came back

1028
01:44:57.56 --> 01:45:01.96
I had asked children which is his senior on to go to get the very best trooper he could find

1029
01:45:01.96 --> 01:45:07.48
to guard white until the replacement unit he was going to join came out someone who wouldn't

1030
01:45:07.48 --> 01:45:16.60
scare and he came up with pfc shnelling don't take any crap from him I told shnelling and watch

1031
01:45:16.60 --> 01:45:24.28
out the unit coming out will pick him up that was it except that shnelling drilled him through the

1032
01:45:24.28 --> 01:45:30.12
head and killed him right outside the gate white had some words and shnelling had paid no attention

1033
01:45:31.24 --> 01:45:36.92
white had made a threat and then gone for his rifle he got it to his shoulder before shnelling

1034
01:45:36.92 --> 01:45:43.48
squeezed the trigger and the MP at the gate had seen and heard it all thank God it was that cut and

1035
01:45:43.48 --> 01:45:50.52
dry shnelling had done his job I brought in the criminal investigation division people they

1036
01:45:50.52 --> 01:45:56.12
questioned everyone took statements and that was it except that later in the day I had shnelling

1037
01:45:56.12 --> 01:46:03.56
into the office a crowd of white's friends gathered outside chanting we want shnelling we want

1038
01:46:03.56 --> 01:46:09.32
shnelling he killed a brother he killed a brother we want shnelling we want shnelling

1039
01:46:12.20 --> 01:46:21.88
freaking nasty I'm this is like horrible so again just to make sure everyone's tracking

1040
01:46:23.32 --> 01:46:27.64
he puts in the guy comes back he hadn't white comes back hadn't done a good job

1041
01:46:27.64 --> 01:46:33.16
so he's got him standing by for the next platoon that's gonna go out while he's standing by

1042
01:46:35.40 --> 01:46:41.56
Herbert puts a guy to guard him this guy named shnelling shnelling's out there guarding him

1043
01:46:42.36 --> 01:46:52.04
white makes a move shnelling kills him luckily there's a witness which is the MP

1044
01:46:52.04 --> 01:47:06.68
who had seen and heard it all so in now they're in the office of Herbert and there's a crowd out

1045
01:47:06.68 --> 01:47:13.08
front of white's friends saying we want shnelling we want shnelling he killed a brother he killed a brother

1046
01:47:15.16 --> 01:47:18.76
and here's what Herbert does I reached over and picked up my M16

1047
01:47:18.76 --> 01:47:28.52
look shnelling you are now a spec for so he promotes him and says not because you killed a man

1048
01:47:28.52 --> 01:47:34.92
but because you didn't fail to do it when it was your job now about that out there that's up to you

1049
01:47:35.56 --> 01:47:41.96
I'll tell you what I do I'd walk out there and end it right now I'd pick out the biggest mouth

1050
01:47:41.96 --> 01:47:47.16
out there and walk up and explain the facts tell them you tell them that you just made

1051
01:47:47.16 --> 01:47:53.16
corporal and if they don't clear out you might take it into your mind to try for sergeant

1052
01:47:55.32 --> 01:48:00.84
I jacked around into the M16 chamber I'll cover you from up here and if anyone so much

1053
01:48:00.84 --> 01:48:05.88
as raises a weapon I'll drop him that's the least I can do I shrugged

1054
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.32
he stepped through the door and walked over to the group I could not hear what he said but they

1055
01:48:13.32 --> 01:48:20.76
dispersed and I never heard white's name again which is sad too that a man could die and snap

1056
01:48:21.40 --> 01:48:24.20
just fade out of people's minds and disappear

1057
01:48:30.60 --> 01:48:37.48
you're gnarly want to talk about some leadership challenges that's like insane right

1058
01:48:38.04 --> 01:48:38.84
that's insane

1059
01:48:38.84 --> 01:48:52.20
yeah I mean does this kind of stuff still happen like now yeah it's just seems so almost like wild

1060
01:48:52.20 --> 01:49:01.08
Westish oh yeah that that's that section right there like that's a that's an insane the whole thing is

1061
01:49:01.08 --> 01:49:11.96
freaking crazy yeah yeah that is crazy I mean like there's so many elements too you know

1062
01:49:11.96 --> 01:49:19.72
where it's like all right you know you have a friend he gets straight up just killed but

1063
01:49:20.36 --> 01:49:24.12
you know and it's like it's hard it's one of those deals where you kind of got to take sides a

1064
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:29.40
little bit or whatever right if you're in that mix or whatever so your guy your friend your brother

1065
01:49:29.40 --> 01:49:33.64
gets killed by another guy so it's like all right we got to see vengeance this is obviously

1066
01:49:33.64 --> 01:49:37.48
out of line obviously not part of this you know we're all the same team where you're going to kill this

1067
01:49:37.48 --> 01:49:41.72
guy all you know no matter what happens kind of like you didn't have to kill him it's easy to be like

1068
01:49:41.72 --> 01:49:46.84
you didn't have to kill him whatever so yeah of course so they want vengeance they want just

1069
01:49:46.84 --> 01:49:52.12
as they want like all this stuff or whatever and they kind of have a point in in a in a way

1070
01:49:52.12 --> 01:49:56.52
especially if they don't know the whole thing they kind of have a point yeah well you're also

1071
01:49:56.52 --> 01:50:05.72
so let's face it there's a huge assumption that the lone MP is just of the big witness right

1072
01:50:05.72 --> 01:50:11.24
this one I mean what if what if shaleings friends with the MP so hey I got this issue with this guy

1073
01:50:11.80 --> 01:50:16.28
or hey we just had beef and I shot this guy you got me and he's like yeah that's what happened

1074
01:50:16.28 --> 01:50:23.80
he showed it is weapon right one guy one is it's it's it's it's such a freaking nightmare

1075
01:50:23.80 --> 01:50:29.72
and then okay then then it gets worse so where you know he's he's like hey this is what you

1076
01:50:29.72 --> 01:50:36.12
should do this is what I would just crazy but there's a lot of no and the thing is but that's

1077
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:40.44
not gonna I mean of course it worked right but we don't we don't even know what he said we don't do

1078
01:50:40.44 --> 01:50:46.36
in the moment before he went out but that's not gonna work but these guys like they want to

1079
01:50:46.36 --> 01:50:50.44
they want to kill me already you know I already killed they're got like we're at war right now

1080
01:50:50.44 --> 01:50:55.16
with this war within the war going on right now here's what here's the only thing that makes me think

1081
01:50:57.56 --> 01:51:01.96
well how it turned out you think well I I wonder if his friends were kind of like

1082
01:51:02.76 --> 01:51:09.72
look we know why and why it was kind of like he maybe he you know maybe they knew what type of

1083
01:51:09.72 --> 01:51:15.40
person he was and you had that he was close to the ragged edge or whatever but god I don't even know

1084
01:51:15.40 --> 01:51:25.72
what to say about this like it's just a freaking nightmare this whole book is freaking crazy like

1085
01:51:25.72 --> 01:51:32.20
when you think let look at what we just read you got this freaking soldier killing another soldier you

1086
01:51:32.20 --> 01:51:47.16
got the woman getting her throat slash there's four other people executed it's madness all right

1087
01:51:48.84 --> 01:51:54.92
under what circumstances do you slay the girls through because obviously the girls not military

1088
01:51:54.92 --> 01:52:01.40
nothing like this yeah mean the you know oh she's a vc sympathizer that's you know probably what their claim was

1089
01:52:03.40 --> 01:52:09.08
yeah yeah I guess I will give you no circumstance if that's what you're looking for right

1090
01:52:09.08 --> 01:52:13.48
well I shouldn't say that you know this you know you could obviously be in some kind of a

1091
01:52:14.12 --> 01:52:18.92
hand-to-hand combat scenario where you've got an enemy fighter that happens to be female

1092
01:52:18.92 --> 01:52:26.20
you know could happen with their baby okay yeah I mean there's a thing okay in this scenario

1093
01:52:26.20 --> 01:52:30.68
it makes no sense whatsoever in this scenario Herbert saying look that's a freaking war crime

1094
01:52:31.56 --> 01:52:38.12
that's what he's saying that's what we're two like Herbert he's you know like on the like he's

1095
01:52:38.12 --> 01:52:41.96
uh what I say earlier he's a straight-laced guy right he's like a straight-laced guy

1096
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:49.000
that's when he sees stuff like that it he's unacceptable to and and that's what's about the

1097
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:55.32
about the guy white getting killed he's not the Herbert's not the kind when I'm Herbert

1098
01:52:55.32 --> 01:52:58.92
you remember in Korean War they go hey burned down this village he's like I'm not gonna do it

1099
01:53:00.12 --> 01:53:04.52
they they bring that up and that's kind of why focused on some of that stuff and um it when we did

1100
01:53:04.52 --> 01:53:11.88
the last podcast you know he had had this he he he mentioned that they had uh the first black

1101
01:53:11.88 --> 01:53:17.64
replacement showing up and he was like we didn't you know we don't the what the troops didn't care

1102
01:53:17.64 --> 01:53:22.68
if you did a good job you were we're good he talked about the fact that he was raised

1103
01:53:24.20 --> 01:53:28.68
by that doctor that was like hey all these people in the world they're people like you they're

1104
01:53:28.68 --> 01:53:34.28
out there aren't trying to feed their families so he's seems like he's this kind of straight

1105
01:53:34.28 --> 01:53:45.56
laced for lack of a better word good person man I like to sit down with this dude he's not alive any more

1106
01:53:45.56 --> 01:53:58.60
button I know you haven't seen the movie Platoon pull you should watch it that shows a lot of chaos

1107
01:53:58.60 --> 01:54:05.32
mayhem but all these things that you read all the books you read about Vietnam and all the movies

1108
01:54:05.32 --> 01:54:11.96
that you see about Vietnam like it's all wrapped up in this in these scenarios that are just freaking

1109
01:54:11.96 --> 01:54:22.76
insane I mean one of your soldiers kills one of your other soldiers after you say hey you you got

1110
01:54:22.76 --> 01:54:28.84
to go out it's like nuts and then you're thinking well look then you're thinking is it worth it

1111
01:54:30.12 --> 01:54:34.36
like hey this guy white I could have just said all right fine you're not going out right fine

1112
01:54:34.36 --> 01:54:39.48
you go see I'll put you on kp dude you can go peel potatoes you know what I mean and then what happens

1113
01:54:39.48 --> 01:54:43.48
a bit I and then other people like well I don't want to go out either so now what are we doing yeah

1114
01:54:46.36 --> 01:54:51.88
I mean it kind of could be viewed as like yeah man that's like that's how it needs to be almost

1115
01:54:51.88 --> 01:54:56.76
yeah it could be and this is why it's that you got to be very careful about painting yourself

1116
01:54:56.76 --> 01:55:02.76
into a corner right you have to be very careful about painting yourself into a corner in life

1117
01:55:03.32 --> 01:55:07.08
especially as a little in from a leadership position if you paint yourself into a corner you're

1118
01:55:07.08 --> 01:55:13.56
you're painting in that corner there's no moving there's no moving so for me

1119
01:55:15.72 --> 01:55:19.56
well as I look at this I'm okay I got a guy that doesn't want to go what can I get from him what

1120
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:24.28
can I do with him how can I talk to him and again we don't know any of the history the guy

1121
01:55:24.28 --> 01:55:28.60
would know how bad of a soldier he was we know his behavior was I mean obviously he's calling the

1122
01:55:28.60 --> 01:55:33.56
he's calling his commander like a son of a bitch and all this stuff so he's not you can tell he's not

1123
01:55:33.56 --> 01:55:40.04
down for the cause right so why is that how do we build a relationship with that guy

1124
01:55:41.32 --> 01:55:45.40
and there's some guys that are totally overboard right they're gone like you're not going to get

1125
01:55:45.40 --> 01:55:51.64
him back well he there and if he's there why you actually have them out on patrol but if everything

1126
01:55:51.64 --> 01:55:57.40
you is kind of blocking white you're sort of you're sort of like hey this is what everyone this

1127
01:55:57.40 --> 01:56:02.68
is what you're going to do and you have no you paint yourself in that corner and you have no way out of it

1128
01:56:02.68 --> 01:56:16.04
hmm going back to the book I should never have had any problems in Vietnam because it was an

1129
01:56:16.04 --> 01:56:23.80
infantry war infantry and helicopters with a different quality of commanders the helicopters could have

1130
01:56:23.80 --> 01:56:28.04
played a very important role in command and control the unfortunate fact was that the commanders

1131
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:33.24
kept their butts glued in the seats in the birds I don't think I can overemphasize the weaknesses

1132
01:56:33.24 --> 01:56:41.000
and heritness from 1,500 feet up war was simply a lot of little guys in green running here and there

1133
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.68
shooting up the landscape the birdmen he's talking about the commander's fast forward a little bit

1134
01:56:46.68 --> 01:56:51.24
the birdmen may have been commanders in the technical sense of the word but they weren't leaders

1135
01:56:51.24 --> 01:57:00.12
and the grunts knew it down there was their world it was a ground war an infantry exercise and

1136
01:57:00.12 --> 01:57:07.000
as infantry we could have won it man for man we were better and we could have won it with less than

1137
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.44
half the people we had there all we had to do was get rid of the wasted headquarters

1138
01:57:12.44 --> 01:57:18.04
chaff get rid of the px's in the state houses and the clubs and the massage parlors and the pools

1139
01:57:18.04 --> 01:57:25.48
and the pizza houses and the commissaries and get down to fighting an infantry war we had the training

1140
01:57:25.48 --> 01:57:31.000
and we had the men who could have done the job the problem was not only a lack of command leadership

1141
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.56
but a lack of distinct mission we didn't have one before I got there we didn't have one while I was

1142
01:57:37.56 --> 01:57:45.24
there and we never had one after I left but an army requires a mission it desperately needs some

1143
01:57:45.24 --> 01:57:51.64
direction towards a specific goal it was all charts and graphs for us with machine technicians

1144
01:57:51.64 --> 01:57:56.92
like the West Point engineers running the show I don't think we have to be conditioned to kill

1145
01:57:56.92 --> 01:58:03.16
we need no training to destroy will built for that killing comes easy established no rules

1146
01:58:03.16 --> 01:58:10.60
and leave a vacuum and won what you end up with our me lie and cool away the absence of policy

1147
01:58:10.60 --> 01:58:28.12
and mission was a policy in itself need to know what the freaking mission is by the way

1148
01:58:29.16 --> 01:58:35.40
in war freaking absolutely I guess we'll in your normal life yes absolutely in your business

1149
01:58:35.40 --> 01:58:43.000
and your job yes and you know the freaking mission is fast forward as we continue to score

1150
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.44
every night Franklin began to increase his visits to the field finally he made it a point to be on

1151
01:58:48.44 --> 01:58:54.60
hand personally to personally count the bodies and I found myself as his constant escort guiding him

1152
01:58:54.60 --> 01:58:59.88
from one dead man to the next and standing by while he snapped photos it was another syndrome

1153
01:58:59.88 --> 01:59:03.64
the guys that didn't kill anybody were the ones who broke their asses to get a picture

1154
01:59:03.64 --> 01:59:09.64
what the hell it would probably have been the same way with Indian scalps if we had cameras back then

1155
01:59:11.88 --> 01:59:15.40
so Franklin is out there kind of coming out and he goes through a bunch of this stuff

1156
01:59:19.96 --> 01:59:23.80
there's a guy named Grimshaw and we're gonna hear his name later

1157
01:59:26.60 --> 01:59:32.28
one of his company commanders Grimshaw said a dead VC is a dead VC and a dead NVA is a dead NVA

1158
01:59:32.28 --> 01:59:37.72
and a dead VCI is a dead VCI except of course when killed by the second battalion

1159
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:43.32
then there are only dead if Franklin touches the touches his toe to them

1160
01:59:44.36 --> 01:59:48.36
and they better be wearing a uniform and have a weapon what the hell is I trying to do Franklin

1161
01:59:48.36 --> 01:59:54.68
asked I had to be an ass to move to rifle companies that distance in the dark why they might have

1162
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:59.48
opened up on each other if either of them had become disoriented and besides he said it was one

1163
01:59:59.48 --> 02:00:04.52
big waste we could have taken them all in a court and search and saved all the inconvenience

1164
02:00:05.16 --> 02:00:15.64
so meanwhile while all this stuff is happening the the brigade is keeping battalion scores

1165
02:00:15.64 --> 02:00:20.84
they're keeping scores to figure out who's the best battalion who's the best battalion

1166
02:00:20.84 --> 02:00:26.36
they keep track of a bunch of different things enemy killed an a killed an action body count

1167
02:00:26.36 --> 02:00:33.32
enemy prisoners of war enemy contacts enemy weapons captured number of a wall so who's

1168
02:00:33.32 --> 02:00:37.72
absent how many people you got absent without lead how many article 15s have you done meaning

1169
02:00:37.72 --> 02:00:43.32
how many times have you punished somebody how many delinquencies have you had how many malaria

1170
02:00:43.32 --> 02:00:48.04
cases do you have how many relishments do you have how many special courts do you have

1171
02:00:49.08 --> 02:00:53.32
and then they take all these different numbers and they put them into like one final number

1172
02:00:53.32 --> 02:01:00.28
so here's how the numbers shake out basically they shake out the second battalion so her birds

1173
02:01:00.28 --> 02:01:07.000
battalion is winning in all categories it's not even close for enemy killed an action it's

1174
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:15.40
uh the other battalions are 14 4 29 and 36 second battalion has 84 so more than twice as much

1175
02:01:15.40 --> 02:01:22.92
as the next battalion for enemy captured listen to these numbers eight zero zero and three

1176
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:35.000
how many does the second battalion have 90 for enemy contacts it's 34 27 37 60 and

1177
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.96
second battalion has 66 for enemy weapons captured it's 15 11 3 and 17

1178
02:01:41.96 --> 02:01:48.92
16 second battalion has 57 so this is not even it's almost like it's not even close for

1179
02:01:48.92 --> 02:01:55.64
absent ways that without leave so this is this should you want below number here it's 14 24 26

1180
02:01:55.64 --> 02:02:00.44
and 24 and what is second battalion have eight they only have eight people that have gone a

1181
02:02:00.44 --> 02:02:08.76
wall for article 15s the numbers are 39 56 57 and 52 what is second battalion have 24

1182
02:02:08.76 --> 02:02:18.12
for delinquency reports 17 9 11 10 second battalion has five malaria they're all the same

1183
02:02:19.64 --> 02:02:25.64
reenlistments listen to this reenlistments the numbers are zero zero 40 and zero

1184
02:02:26.52 --> 02:02:36.68
no one wants to frequency in what is second battalion have 53 so the total score and they have

1185
02:02:36.68 --> 02:02:42.04
whatever they have this wave making all this into one number second battalion for this

1186
02:02:42.04 --> 02:02:51.40
particular month this is February 1969 has 420 points during the lead and then the other

1187
02:02:51.40 --> 02:03:00.36
ones are 180 145 70 and 20 I mean just combat ineffective right and they're and by the way this is

1188
02:03:00.36 --> 02:03:07.40
so they're getting graded by Franklin and Barnes getting graded and they're crushing

1189
02:03:08.44 --> 02:03:16.68
second battalion under herbert is absolutely crushing everything but the hits just keep on coming

1190
02:03:17.40 --> 02:03:21.48
there's some military intelligence interrogation rooms that are on their little base

1191
02:03:23.16 --> 02:03:27.88
and herbert pays a visit I walked into one of the rooms and back and knocked lightly on the door

1192
02:03:27.88 --> 02:03:33.96
one night who's there Herbert just a moment sir someone answered and second later the door

1193
02:03:33.96 --> 02:03:39.80
swung inward sergeant Carmody greeted me come in sir I squeeze past him and close the door behind me

1194
02:03:39.80 --> 02:03:45.96
inside in addition to Carmody were captain bowers of Vietnamese man and one of the honey's

1195
02:03:46.84 --> 02:03:51.64
the wild cats had captured in the morning she was seated to my left in a chair against the wall

1196
02:03:51.64 --> 02:03:56.92
just off the corner Carmody was standing to a right my left and the Vietnamese man was sitting just

1197
02:03:56.92 --> 02:04:01.64
off my right foot facing the girl in the chair their knees only a couple inches apart captain

1198
02:04:01.64 --> 02:04:05.96
bowers was just behind the Vietnamese man sitting in a chair and leaning over the viet's shoulder

1199
02:04:05.96 --> 02:04:12.44
the girl was moaning and trembling find anything out I asked turning to Carmody she claims

1200
02:04:12.44 --> 02:04:19.000
she was out picking waterbed bugs sir he said and laughed what patrol where was it headed what about

1201
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.12
what about the patrol where was it headed Carmody turned to her and asked something in Vietnamese

1202
02:04:24.12 --> 02:04:30.92
she shook her head he hit her with the back of his hand raking it down along her face you're a

1203
02:04:30.92 --> 02:04:37.80
fucking liar he shouted blood began to rush into the long abrasion on her cheek it began to happen

1204
02:04:37.80 --> 02:04:42.44
in a rush I turned to bowers thinking he would say something Carmody said something in Vietnamese

1205
02:04:42.44 --> 02:04:47.72
bowers nodded to the Vietnamese man in front of him and touched his shoulder with his hand the girl

1206
02:04:47.72 --> 02:04:55.24
screamed I glanced down and saw for the first time that there were wires from her body to a telephone

1207
02:04:55.24 --> 02:05:03.08
between the viet's knees he was cranking it I grabbed the wires and yanked damn near lifting the

1208
02:05:03.08 --> 02:05:09.08
viet up with them before the wires separated from the phone it clattered to the floor are you crazy

1209
02:05:09.08 --> 02:05:16.28
bowers I yelled so just so you understand these these telephone machines that you can power them

1210
02:05:16.28 --> 02:05:21.72
by cranking them this is an old school like telephone and so that's where he had to have these

1211
02:05:21.72 --> 02:05:27.000
they're basically electro shock electro electro cutinger are you crazy bowers I yelled sir I

1212
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.28
what the hell kind of crap are you pulling here sir I go get okay sir major okay and says I don't

1213
02:05:32.28 --> 02:05:36.52
give a damn what he says you go get him I said I turned to comedy and knock this off until this thing

1214
02:05:36.52 --> 02:05:40.92
is settled bowers left and Carmody the viet and I followed him out of the hall leaving the girl

1215
02:05:40.92 --> 02:05:45.56
alone in the little room in a moment bowers returned major okay and isn't here he said where the

1216
02:05:45.56 --> 02:05:50.84
hell is he he's gone down to brigades sir and behind him through the open doorway I saw the major

1217
02:05:50.84 --> 02:05:56.28
getting into a Jeep I left to and walked down to Franklin's office where not surprisingly okay

1218
02:05:56.28 --> 02:06:01.000
was still deep in conversation with the deputy commander Franklin sigled to meet a hold up until he

1219
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.28
was finished when okay left Franklin called me in and immediately began screaming we were right

1220
02:06:06.28 --> 02:06:10.92
back where he left off you son of a bitch he ran it you dirty rotten son of a bitch how many times

1221
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:17.80
if I warn you to stay the hell away from MI or have your tap cut off it seemed like the time for accuracy

1222
02:06:17.80 --> 02:06:23.72
four times sir I said I did you understand yes sir but I understand torture too I don't give

1223
02:06:23.72 --> 02:06:29.000
a shit about that I sir God damn it herpurver don't you sir me I gave you a director or did you

1224
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.16
understand it yes sir but they were torturing a viet and he said you personally see them torturing

1225
02:06:33.16 --> 02:06:38.92
this girl at least he knew it had been a girl yes sir they US soldiers no sir this viet

1226
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:43.56
to meet God damn it Herbert how many times must I explain the rules of land warfare to you over here

1227
02:06:43.56 --> 02:06:48.04
what the Vietnamese do is none of our damn business but sir the guy was cranking this phone generator

1228
02:06:48.04 --> 02:06:54.60
while bowers was who is cranking the generator this interpreter I guess and was he viet to meet

1229
02:06:54.60 --> 02:07:00.68
yes sir but and was bowers cranking no sir but then God damn it that's the end of it okay and said

1230
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:06.12
that's all there is to know he lifted his hand as shook his finger one more god damn interference

1231
02:07:06.12 --> 02:07:12.28
Herbert and you're all washed up at MI understand no sir I don't carmety was did you see

1232
02:07:12.28 --> 02:07:18.20
carmety crank the phone no sir did you see any US crank that phone no sir then what's your bitch

1233
02:07:18.92 --> 02:07:23.80
it was the first time I had to really compose a sentence for one thing I told him it was a

1234
02:07:23.80 --> 02:07:28.60
violation of US army directives as well as Geneva Accords and the rules of land warfare

1235
02:07:28.60 --> 02:07:35.000
and for another I finished it just isn't army oh you son of a bitch he said you're so

1236
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.24
God damn righteous you never did anything like that right no sir I haven't he slapped the girl

1237
02:07:41.24 --> 02:07:47.24
end and you never have honor of it is that correct that is correct sir I but you saw comedy

1238
02:07:47.24 --> 02:07:53.40
slap her huh yes sir I did and and so all at once you're the judge the jury and the executioner

1239
02:07:53.40 --> 02:07:59.08
is that correct Herbert no sir I know sir I know sir I know sir I tell you what you are Herbert you're

1240
02:07:59.08 --> 02:08:04.92
a disloyal and you're maybe getting kind of old you just can't stomach it anymore what the hell

1241
02:08:04.92 --> 02:08:11.72
is a matter with you look he said with relative benevolence in his voice let me explain these are the

1242
02:08:11.72 --> 02:08:17.48
enemy even you must be able to understand that right these are the guys who killed your buddies

1243
02:08:18.36 --> 02:08:23.32
whom did she kill sir God damn it I'm talking about the enemy in general he said raising his hand

1244
02:08:23.32 --> 02:08:30.28
let me put it this way their VC I decided there was no sense in carrying out this farce any further

1245
02:08:30.28 --> 02:08:35.000
and we were supposed to be soldiers and we are supposed to be soldiers sir American soldiers

1246
02:08:36.12 --> 02:08:41.48
I want to make a charge I'd like to charge charge my ass you've already made a charge and now it's

1247
02:08:41.48 --> 02:08:47.08
an investigation and I'll take care of that not you you just be able to back your mouth with sworn

1248
02:08:47.08 --> 02:09:04.60
verified testimony sure I said sir anytime yeah so again it's very strange not very strange but

1249
02:09:04.60 --> 02:09:10.76
you can see this guy he seems to be trying to do the right thing but man he's making some enemies

1250
02:09:10.76 --> 02:09:23.24
I guess big part of his me trying my best to look at it from all or more than just herbards perspective

1251
02:09:23.24 --> 02:09:28.20
and he kind of got it meant when you think about it where you don't want to like

1252
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:35.80
okay when you're in a complex situation and you have like a goal and then you have all these rules

1253
02:09:35.80 --> 02:09:44.36
sometimes those rules do get kind of looked over some on a smaller level right and sometimes it

1254
02:09:44.36 --> 02:09:53.40
can be more efficient meanwhile you got this guy who's kind of by the book and most people are

1255
02:09:53.40 --> 02:09:59.32
most people I'm pretty I almost want to say everybody's not going to be by the book hundred

1256
02:09:59.32 --> 02:10:04.12
percent of the time okay in one way or another and you get a group of people and they're they're

1257
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:11.08
carrying out a goal whatever and and it's working and it's working out and they're okay well that's

1258
02:10:11.08 --> 02:10:16.20
an assumption yeah because it doesn't because let's face it if we just look well how well the

1259
02:10:16.20 --> 02:10:22.36
battalions are doing his battalions doing the best and he's kind of flying the the righteous path yeah

1260
02:10:22.36 --> 02:10:28.92
yeah fully and yeah this is this particular story aside I'm saying in general okay and then you get

1261
02:10:28.92 --> 02:10:34.84
whether be a new guy or just somebody there who's always like how should I's not in my

1262
02:10:34.84 --> 02:10:40.52
commanding but like nitpicking or certain things and it kind of jams up your whole approach to

1263
02:10:40.52 --> 02:10:46.52
what you're doing sure it could be better or not or whatever but it becomes kind of a nuisance you know

1264
02:10:46.52 --> 02:10:55.72
well okay I mean I see what you're saying but let's let's remember that this guy is witnessing

1265
02:10:55.72 --> 02:11:01.000
murders tortures sexual assaults which I didn't really cover rapes which I didn't really cover but

1266
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:07.80
they're in here he's he's seeing all kinds of horrible shit this isn't somebody this isn't all

1267
02:11:07.80 --> 02:11:14.92
of these people are kind of bending the rules to get the job done the same that yeah fully and that's

1268
02:11:14.92 --> 02:11:20.36
what I mean so and that's what I mean just what you said like people bending the rules to get the job

1269
02:11:20.36 --> 02:11:26.20
done kind of a thing right we we understand that yes and he understands it right remember the guy

1270
02:11:26.20 --> 02:11:32.68
that got told hey bring back the mermaids on your patrol and and the guy says this is stupid and

1271
02:11:32.68 --> 02:11:37.32
Herbert says well it's an order and he says fuck them remember that part he's down with bending

1272
02:11:37.32 --> 02:11:45.40
the rules if the rules don't make sense right yeah fully and uh and yes that is true and we got a good

1273
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:52.52
bird's eye view of the whole deal for sure but the guy this guy that he's talking to Franklin

1274
02:11:52.52 --> 02:11:57.80
yeah Franklin from his perspective he might be looking at it as hey we're bending the rules to get

1275
02:11:57.80 --> 02:12:04.36
the job done he might be genuine feeling that he might be he might be now what you have to fall back on

1276
02:12:05.40 --> 02:12:11.24
as you have to you have to fall back and this is a tough one you have to fall back not only on

1277
02:12:11.24 --> 02:12:18.76
what is the right thing to do but you also have to bounce that off of one is legal yeah okay so

1278
02:12:18.76 --> 02:12:23.96
for the young leaders out there especially military leaders but this applies to anything this applies

1279
02:12:23.96 --> 02:12:28.76
to business because look there's things there's things you do in business where oh there's the right

1280
02:12:28.76 --> 02:12:33.40
thing to do and then there's the wrong thing to do and then there's the legal thing to do

1281
02:12:33.40 --> 02:12:41.48
and then yeah there's the criminal thing to do so when you're doing something hey listen I can

1282
02:12:41.48 --> 02:12:49.000
explain this you know the the CNN test have you ever heard of this before look if I can go on CNN

1283
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:55.96
and say hey this is why I made this decision and you don't feel shame because of what you did

1284
02:12:55.96 --> 02:13:03.24
that's definitely part of the test the other thing you got to remember is what is legal because

1285
02:13:04.36 --> 02:13:09.40
if you let and this is something you can tell you your your employees or your troops

1286
02:13:09.96 --> 02:13:17.32
you got to remember about what's legal because someone that should steer because look if if

1287
02:13:17.32 --> 02:13:25.16
you're let's say you're in a you're in a platoon you're out on a target and you find somebody that's

1288
02:13:25.88 --> 02:13:32.36
killed Americans right they freaking kill they have the bodies and you catch them with the bodies

1289
02:13:32.36 --> 02:13:38.76
and with the freaking bloody knife there's almost no one that would say okay well I don't feel

1290
02:13:38.76 --> 02:13:44.84
like killing those bad guys right there's a guy with a bloody knife you see them killing Americans

1291
02:13:44.84 --> 02:13:49.40
to say hey do the right thing a lot of people look I don't know the right thing to do is we kill

1292
02:13:49.40 --> 02:13:54.92
that guy we execute them you have you have to remember that that is not legal you are not allowed

1293
02:13:54.92 --> 02:14:01.48
to do that so you have to get your people to understand that regardless of how you feel

1294
02:14:02.60 --> 02:14:06.44
it's not just to see an end test because that kind of past the CNN test hey I showed up

1295
02:14:06.44 --> 02:14:12.20
this guy killed a bunch of Americans and we freaking we I shot him and you can that's the

1296
02:14:12.20 --> 02:14:17.16
way it is and I I'd feel no shame because of it you pass the CNN test guess what you can still go

1297
02:14:17.16 --> 02:14:22.68
to you can sell what a jail it's legally wrong so as a leader what you have to do you have to

1298
02:14:22.68 --> 02:14:30.28
sort of merge all these ideas into one final thought and you have to take the fact that hey what

1299
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:38.20
this is not legal to do this this is not legal to do this now there's others we could come up with

1300
02:14:38.20 --> 02:14:46.28
scenarios where doing the legal thing still isn't the right thing and it's actually wrong it's wrong

1301
02:14:46.28 --> 02:14:51.72
to do that and sometimes you may have to break that rule but what we're talking about here is

1302
02:14:51.72 --> 02:14:57.48
they're doing things that are not legal yeah so regardless of how you feel you're doing something

1303
02:14:57.48 --> 02:15:03.40
that is not legal on a very in a very big way these aren't minor charges these are war crimes

1304
02:15:03.40 --> 02:15:07.96
scenarios which right this isn't like hey we've been through we we left some freaking

1305
02:15:07.96 --> 02:15:15.24
mermaids out in the field which is pretty easy to argue right hey listen my guys were already tired

1306
02:15:15.24 --> 02:15:17.96
we were if we're gonna carry these things it was gonna bog us down we had a better chance

1307
02:15:17.96 --> 02:15:23.88
to get an ambush it was gonna be a problem I left them okay got it that's not war crimes

1308
02:15:23.88 --> 02:15:30.20
yeah so there's a there's a difference yeah yeah there does there comes a point where it gets

1309
02:15:30.20 --> 02:15:34.60
like you just can't defend certain things you know and yeah especially when you're talking about

1310
02:15:34.60 --> 02:15:38.44
like you got to remember that's not even just that you can't defend him because if I roll up

1311
02:15:38.44 --> 02:15:45.000
and I find an ISIS fighter that killed three people you can defend that all day you can defend

1312
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.04
oh yeah I saw him I'm a shot him he killed three Americans I saw him doing it you can defend

1313
02:15:50.04 --> 02:15:55.08
that all day long but it's not legal so now you got to deal with the ramifications whatever those are

1314
02:15:55.08 --> 02:16:04.84
yeah you're seeing the movie cobra no come on so best of us alone cobra I have not seen it

1315
02:16:04.84 --> 02:16:10.44
dang all watchbook two new watch cobra no not deal so there's a fight there's a fight in the

1316
02:16:10.44 --> 02:16:15.08
beginning where this psycho guy takes over the supermarket or whatever right and cobra is kind of one

1317
02:16:15.08 --> 02:16:20.44
of these guys he uses excessive force you know kind of like demolition men same actor by the way so

1318
02:16:20.44 --> 02:16:26.52
that's just so either way so cobra ends up killing this guy right and then the the

1319
02:16:26.52 --> 02:16:33.40
press comes not CNN but the press comes and they're trying to interview cobra and they're like

1320
02:16:33.40 --> 02:16:37.88
he's like hey did you have to kill him you know did you have to die or did you you know

1321
02:16:40.28 --> 02:16:43.80
you know he has a right to live and all this stuff for whatever and he's like yeah he's

1322
02:16:43.80 --> 02:16:47.32
you'll did you use excessive force and all this he's like yeah he used everything I have

1323
02:16:47.32 --> 02:16:52.04
and he's like hey you know like people are protected are protected you know entitled to

1324
02:16:52.04 --> 02:16:59.72
protection by the law or whatever and he says so he grabs the recorder and unwraps or he

1325
02:16:59.72 --> 02:17:04.04
uncovers like one of the bodies right and he's like you tell that to his family huh

1326
02:17:06.20 --> 02:17:12.92
he passed the CNN test is what I'm saying yeah I think it was legal too though technically

1327
02:17:12.92 --> 02:17:17.56
it depends on the situation it was like borderline so yeah I don't want to go into the movie

1328
02:17:17.56 --> 02:17:22.84
what happened you know to kind of to get cobra off the hook or nothing like that but nonetheless

1329
02:17:22.84 --> 02:17:28.60
that's the CNN test it seems like yeah no that so so the CNN test is but it's not a

1330
02:17:30.04 --> 02:17:37.08
it's not a unilateral test that just because it passed I see it's okay that's what I'm

1331
02:17:37.08 --> 02:17:42.44
trying to explain to young leaders it's not just the CNN test it's the CNN test

1332
02:17:42.44 --> 02:17:50.92
plus it's the legal test is what you're doing legal or is it illegal and if it's illegal

1333
02:17:50.92 --> 02:17:59.48
there are going to be repercussions even if you pass the CNN test so as a leader you've got to

1334
02:17:59.48 --> 02:18:03.88
pay attention those things and what you have to do is keep your troops out of trouble that's

1335
02:18:03.88 --> 02:18:14.36
incumbent upon you to keep your troops out of trouble because they they might be reacting emotionally

1336
02:18:14.36 --> 02:18:16.92
and you're the one that's supposed to rain them in and make sure that they're not getting not

1337
02:18:16.92 --> 02:18:24.20
not doing things that are illegal and I'm not saying those things are deserved you know you find

1338
02:18:24.20 --> 02:18:29.64
somebody that just killed three Americans that that ISIS member deserves to die we get it

1339
02:18:29.64 --> 02:18:39.000
not legal yeah not so out so where did these go and and my original point was like Franklin

1340
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:44.84
maybe to him it was he was quote unquote like I said maybe bending a few rules or

1341
02:18:44.84 --> 02:18:51.40
returning a blind eye just just small minor things and the means kind of justified the end

1342
02:18:51.40 --> 02:18:56.92
scenario and yeah I agree I think that's true or it's like well I remember we're

1343
02:18:56.92 --> 02:19:03.88
slitting a girls throat yeah yeah fully we have to leaders have to lead their troops to make

1344
02:19:03.88 --> 02:19:08.44
sure that they are not just doing the right thing that they're not just passing the CNN test

1345
02:19:08.44 --> 02:19:13.32
but they're also doing what's legal otherwise there's going to be repercussions that's just

1346
02:19:13.32 --> 02:19:24.76
that's just the way it is the seriality all right back to the book when I remember the

1347
02:19:24.76 --> 02:19:29.96
folly of it all now I rationalize a bit and tell myself that there wasn't enough time to be

1348
02:19:29.96 --> 02:19:35.64
fully sensitive to the finality of death for instance to say that it had not been a very

1349
02:19:35.64 --> 02:19:41.48
important day because the second battalion had but two NVA kills now seems ludicrous it was a

1350
02:19:41.48 --> 02:19:48.04
damn important day for those two dead men when even just one man died or got his fingers blown

1351
02:19:48.04 --> 02:19:53.16
off for his legs shattered or is hearing impaired or his eyes bludded and blinded it was one hell

1352
02:19:53.16 --> 02:20:00.36
of a costly battle especially if you happen to be the guy who got it that day it's something

1353
02:20:00.36 --> 02:20:07.88
generals and presidents can never understand only mothers fathers brothers sons daughters and wives

1354
02:20:10.12 --> 02:20:14.52
maybe if I were a general or a president who never went to war with his men or who never

1355
02:20:14.52 --> 02:20:20.68
risked paying the same price maybe I'd want to convert the whole damn show into a statistical

1356
02:20:20.68 --> 02:20:28.52
table to be read solemnly by some broadcaster every Thursday night generals and presidents are

1357
02:20:28.52 --> 02:20:35.24
fine for explaining to all of us those things that we ought to be willing to die for but when the war

1358
02:20:35.24 --> 02:20:43.40
is over all that's left our statistics and the generals and the presidents are always among the living

1359
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:50.52
if anything has happened to our country as a result of the Vietnam war it is that our

1360
02:20:50.52 --> 02:20:56.76
national infection with the sickness of the numbers game we reduced the blood and the suffering

1361
02:20:56.76 --> 02:21:04.04
and the death and destruction to mere ciphers and in doing so we reduced our own souls

1362
02:21:06.52 --> 02:21:09.24
numbers don't die people do

1363
02:21:10.52 --> 02:21:16.92
columns of figures don't disintegrate in the explosion of a bomb human beings do

1364
02:21:16.92 --> 02:21:25.08
statistics don't bleed and if you make your war a war of numbers you will have no trouble sleeping

1365
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.80
most generals and presidents slept well

1366
02:21:29.80 --> 02:21:52.60
so this stuff is continuing on in another mind boggling plot twist on April 2, 1969 Barnes

1367
02:21:52.60 --> 02:21:57.40
gave me a letter of commendation from general counters who had replaced general peers as the

1368
02:21:57.40 --> 02:22:02.84
commander of the first field force victor he also handed me a letter from peers which had come all the way

1369
02:22:02.84 --> 02:22:08.20
from the states peers was quite complimentary and Barnes added that the second battalion was the

1370
02:22:08.20 --> 02:22:14.12
best in the brigade and that I was the best battalion commander he had personally ever known so that's

1371
02:22:14.12 --> 02:22:23.72
Franklin's boss then he handed me his own letter of commendation the score sheet for the brigade

1372
02:22:23.72 --> 02:22:30.44
which again listed the second battalion as the top battalion and the official IG report which listed

1373
02:22:30.44 --> 02:22:37.32
the second battalion as the tops in the brigade he also assured me that I would very soon begin

1374
02:22:37.32 --> 02:22:43.56
reaping the awards rewards for my efforts as he called them he said the distinguished

1375
02:22:43.56 --> 02:22:50.60
service cross was being prepared and the general already had a verbal assurance it would be approved

1376
02:22:50.60 --> 02:23:00.04
he's getting some love I went back to the battalion and sat down with warm islas bourbon my god what was

1377
02:23:00.04 --> 02:23:06.04
happening two months of nothing but crap and now all this in one day maybe things really were going

1378
02:23:06.04 --> 02:23:10.68
to be different maybe the brigade was going to shape up with less than two and a half months to go

1379
02:23:10.68 --> 02:23:15.88
sweetness and light were in the air and there were signs that everything was going to be okay

1380
02:23:15.88 --> 02:23:24.60
but something else nodded me I had reported eight atrocities or war crimes or whatever the

1381
02:23:24.60 --> 02:23:31.80
hell they wanted to call them the abuse of the detainees at on k the three torture incidents the

1382
02:23:31.80 --> 02:23:37.24
murders the looting the alleged murder of a young lieutenant and the alleged execution of the

1383
02:23:37.24 --> 02:23:43.56
detainee in the custody of the hero lieutenant if I could get those things cleared up I'd really be up

1384
02:23:43.56 --> 02:23:51.08
to date and I knew I'd better get my statements down sooner or I'd have to get them in writing

1385
02:23:51.08 --> 02:23:55.40
from back in the states taking time out of the command in general staff college at 11 worth

1386
02:23:55.40 --> 02:24:04.28
and I didn't expect to have that kind of time so yeah this all comes really clear right now

1387
02:24:04.28 --> 02:24:08.52
I went down on the morning of April 3rd so the next day to talk to Franklin about them

1388
02:24:08.52 --> 02:24:13.16
Sir I jokingly said when I entered your best batying commander of yesterday would like to have

1389
02:24:13.16 --> 02:24:21.24
a talk with you today okay sure Herbert come in he said have a seat I sat down where he

1390
02:24:21.24 --> 02:24:29.16
indicated it was only it was the only chair in the room what's on your mind the eight allegations sir

1391
02:24:29.16 --> 02:24:33.48
the atrocities I reported I want atrocities he interrupted what the hell are you talking about

1392
02:24:33.48 --> 02:24:39.32
atrocities eight sir and I took them off one by one counting them on my fingers as I went sir

1393
02:24:39.32 --> 02:24:44.20
I'm going home in less than two weeks and most of the other witnesses have already gone I'd

1394
02:24:44.20 --> 02:24:50.12
like to get my part wound up now while I still have time and things are going kind of slow

1395
02:24:53.64 --> 02:24:59.08
God damn it Tony said the investigations are ongoing what more can I do

1396
02:24:59.08 --> 02:25:08.84
the next morning when I reported Barnes was behind his desk and Franklin was in the chair to his

1397
02:25:08.84 --> 02:25:14.76
right it was quick Colonel Herbert the general said I'm going to replace you as the commander of second

1398
02:25:14.76 --> 02:25:21.80
battalion I felt the blood drained from my head replace sir you mean relief not relief Tony replace

1399
02:25:21.80 --> 02:25:27.80
I'm giving you a maximum efficiency report and sending you to Saigon hit me like a ton of rocks

1400
02:25:27.80 --> 02:25:33.32
it is is it over the allegations I made sir Franklin leap to his feet screaming that's right you

1401
02:25:33.32 --> 02:25:38.44
son of a bitch you and your goddamn lies about beach and crouched and all the rest that poor lieutenant

1402
02:25:38.44 --> 02:25:45.96
and every other one of your damn lies and exaggerations so clearly they were buttering him up

1403
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:52.04
hey you've done great you're our best battalion we're got you we give you a maximum efficiency report

1404
02:25:52.04 --> 02:25:57.88
like you're the best guy how about you just freaking keep the old mouth shut my allegations

1405
02:26:00.04 --> 02:26:05.40
and then when he brings him up again they realize he's going to stick to his guns

1406
02:26:05.96 --> 02:26:10.12
I felt cold and empty then a wave of relief swept over me in calm said and I stared at Franklin

1407
02:26:10.12 --> 02:26:15.16
as though he were in insect and I tried to speak as deliberately and as cool as I could

1408
02:26:15.96 --> 02:26:19.96
I'm not talking to you sir I'm trying to speak to my commander general Barnes

1409
02:26:19.96 --> 02:26:26.12
it stopped Franklin's ranting and he gave me the chance to turn back to Barnes sir the very

1410
02:26:26.12 --> 02:26:32.20
least you owe me is a complete investigation to see who really is telling the lies and exaggerating

1411
02:26:32.20 --> 02:26:36.60
the general had his head down over his desk tripling on a piece of note paper

1412
02:26:36.60 --> 02:26:41.24
Carl Franklin has already investigated all your charges and I'm satisfied he said reaching out and

1413
02:26:41.24 --> 02:26:48.44
handing me the note you'll be out on the landing zone in one hour there are two planes leaving

1414
02:26:48.44 --> 02:26:53.48
for side gone today you be on one of them your records will be ready for you an onk when you

1415
02:26:53.48 --> 02:27:01.40
in side gone or onk when you get there you report to Colonel Lou Ashley in side gone it's on the note

1416
02:27:01.40 --> 02:27:05.40
sir I said I have a battalion I've signed for over a million dollars with a material and

1417
02:27:05.40 --> 02:27:11.24
an equipment I just can't clear out in an hour Franklin broken one hour herberg one hour you'll be

1418
02:27:11.24 --> 02:27:15.80
picked up under arrest and taken out by the provost marshal one hour Barnes said again

1419
02:27:15.80 --> 02:27:22.28
I saluted don't do many favors with the efficiency report I intend to see you all again

1420
02:27:24.36 --> 02:27:32.12
so even though they said we're gonna let you out of here with a good evaluation he's saying don't even

1421
02:27:34.52 --> 02:27:36.28
this dude does not play bro

1422
02:27:36.28 --> 02:27:45.88
as I walk back to the battalion I told myself it was important to remain calm

1423
02:27:45.88 --> 02:27:51.48
co-inclected I knew I had them both just as long as I didn't blow it they had gone far beyond

1424
02:27:51.48 --> 02:27:55.80
their authority in removing me without any grounds for relief I was convinced by then

1425
02:27:55.80 --> 02:28:00.52
that it had to be something more than any allegations of atrocities hell everybody knew about

1426
02:28:00.52 --> 02:28:05.56
them anyways somebody else would be bringing them up again and soon if they thought that by

1427
02:28:05.56 --> 02:28:10.04
getting rid of me they were also getting rid of the shame of what it occurred then they that they

1428
02:28:10.04 --> 02:28:15.72
had got it under the rug they neither understood me nor the army at that point I still had faith in

1429
02:28:15.72 --> 02:28:21.24
the system I walked over to the talk Ernie had most of the officers gathered in the briefing room

1430
02:28:21.24 --> 02:28:26.44
he had already told them look I began there's no time to screw around you know I've been given the

1431
02:28:26.44 --> 02:28:31.72
boot that's why I wanted to talk to you all right away I've only got about 15 minutes more before

1432
02:28:31.72 --> 02:28:36.68
I have to get out of here but I wanted to take some time to thank you and get the chance to shake as many

1433
02:28:36.68 --> 02:28:42.20
of your hands that could before I have to go there were some protests and a few remarks about quitting

1434
02:28:42.20 --> 02:28:47.32
I stifled that quickly the army has a system of military justice and rules and rags so none of

1435
02:28:47.32 --> 02:28:52.12
you need to go off half cocked and try and take things into your own hands nobody quit see there

1436
02:28:52.12 --> 02:28:57.000
just keep thinking about the battalion that's what's important not me if you're if you

1437
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:02.04
quit you're letting down not only me but every last one of those grunts out here they have to stay

1438
02:29:02.04 --> 02:29:07.48
they can't quit you can but many of them need you and the guy who replaces me is going to need you

1439
02:29:08.28 --> 02:29:12.92
it's not going to be his fault what happened to me so stick with the battalion and stick with him and

1440
02:29:12.92 --> 02:29:21.72
stick with them I said waving toward the booties I started shaking hands in the in the landing zone

1441
02:29:21.72 --> 02:29:28.04
area men all along the ground were lined up pulling off smoke canisters of every color in the rainbow

1442
02:29:28.04 --> 02:29:33.56
there were maybe a hundred men out there and a hundred smokes it was their honors smoke

1443
02:29:33.56 --> 02:29:38.68
when the troops were coming back after a kill they buzzed the field with a smoke on each skid

1444
02:29:39.72 --> 02:29:44.92
and when one of their own left they lit one to five depending on how well he was like

1445
02:29:44.92 --> 02:29:52.36
light plus his reputation as a fighter and I was looking down on at least a hundred of them knowing

1446
02:29:52.36 --> 02:29:57.32
all the time that nobody was that good but choked up with appreciation nevertheless

1447
02:29:58.52 --> 02:30:05.16
I waved and they waved back the pilot bank the ship again and I sat against the wall rigging

1448
02:30:05.80 --> 02:30:07.000
and wiped my eyes

1449
02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:16.20
we landed in Saigon a bit before nine o'clock that evening and although I shouldn't have

1450
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:20.12
been feeling like a bastard on father's day I didn't although I should have been feeling

1451
02:30:20.12 --> 02:30:25.32
like a bastard on father's day I didn't I was relieved in more ways than one I suppose I

1452
02:30:25.32 --> 02:30:30.44
reasoned that if Barnes and Franklin had hated me that much I was better off out of the outfit

1453
02:30:31.24 --> 02:30:36.76
I had the marbles in my pocket they had nothing to fall back on but their own lies and false

1454
02:30:36.76 --> 02:30:42.52
effications I knew I had been lucky I could have had accidental kills of women and children or other

1455
02:30:42.52 --> 02:30:47.80
non-combatants and they would have had me had the marbles in their pockets I could have ranked second

1456
02:30:47.80 --> 02:30:52.76
or third on the IG inspection I could have had a high court martial rate or accident rate or

1457
02:30:52.76 --> 02:30:58.84
large number of article 15s or delinquencies reports from the military police or any one of a number

1458
02:30:58.84 --> 02:31:04.36
of other things that could have been used against me but I've been lucky frankly I'm used I had

1459
02:31:04.36 --> 02:31:11.24
let Franklin I'm used had let his personal dislike for me get the best of him it had forced him

1460
02:31:11.24 --> 02:31:26.60
into a premature confrontation that I was bound to win I was bound to win well

1461
02:31:26.60 --> 02:31:39.80
it was not that clear cut it was not that clear cut at all and the book goes on and it goes into

1462
02:31:39.80 --> 02:31:52.60
a lot of detail and there are all kinds of further accusations and counter accusations and they end up

1463
02:31:52.60 --> 02:32:01.000
making sworn statements against Herbert including him leading the killing of civilians so they

1464
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:09.88
start making accusations against him and this is and again these documents are in this book that's

1465
02:32:09.88 --> 02:32:14.84
one of the things that makes this book so good is it's got all this actual documentation here they

1466
02:32:14.84 --> 02:32:21.96
they recommend revoking disorders they recommend removing his opportunity to to lead or being

1467
02:32:21.96 --> 02:32:29.72
command again general rust who's the overall decision maker on the case agrees with the accusatory

1468
02:32:29.72 --> 02:32:38.76
statements kills Colonel Herbert's career so the idea that he was bound to win no actually doesn't

1469
02:32:38.76 --> 02:32:44.20
work out that way Colonel Herbert fights it he fights this spends a bunch of his own money

1470
02:32:44.20 --> 02:32:54.84
and then he goes on the offense because he won in investigations before now he goes on the offense

1471
02:32:54.84 --> 02:33:01.72
charges uh brings charges up against Colonel Franklin 14 separate specifications including

1472
02:33:01.72 --> 02:33:08.60
failure to report murders and church torture he does the same thing to general barns fail up failure

1473
02:33:08.60 --> 02:33:15.48
to report war crimes on multiplications so he's going on the offense it gets national publicity it's in the

1474
02:33:15.48 --> 02:33:24.68
news the lead investigator for the army this guy by the name of major Carl Hensley

1475
02:33:26.36 --> 02:33:32.04
according to the book and I hate to say that I'm just because I don't know what I don't know

1476
02:33:32.04 --> 02:33:37.88
what the truth is according to the book this guy major Carl Hensley had told Herbert like look we

1477
02:33:37.88 --> 02:33:44.92
believe you you're right we can win this thing and then he kills himself kills himself with a

1478
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:51.96
shotgun you can you can look that one up it's in a New York Times press briefing major Carl Hensley

1479
02:33:51.96 --> 02:34:01.64
suicide ends up all the charges are eventually dropped against both barns and Franklin

1480
02:34:01.64 --> 02:34:11.08
Colonel Franklin eventually relieved from his command for throwing a Vietnamese body out of

1481
02:34:11.08 --> 02:34:19.000
a helicopter in Vietnam and again this guy was the most decorated from what I could find in

1482
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:27.80
research most decorated officer from his West Point class 1950 1991 by the way Colonel Franklin

1483
02:34:27.80 --> 02:34:36.36
convicted and spent five years in prison for us securities scheme scam swindled about $100 people out

1484
02:34:36.36 --> 02:34:47.16
a million dollars so there's like you know you see these questionable characters characteristics

1485
02:34:48.44 --> 02:34:53.96
so all the charges so imagine us all the charges against barns and Franklin get dropped

1486
02:34:53.96 --> 02:35:01.24
but Herbert is not charged with making a single fall statement so all these things that he had said

1487
02:35:02.20 --> 02:35:05.80
he never gets charged for making a fall statement but the charges get dropped

1488
02:35:09.56 --> 02:35:16.12
he goes kind of public does a bunch of interviews eventually he's retired or he retires

1489
02:35:16.12 --> 02:35:24.60
you know he's done with the army he gets eventually he gets interviewed on 60 minutes by Mike Wallace

1490
02:35:27.56 --> 02:35:33.40
and this is freaking crazy so they have and I've tried to find this him been able to find it

1491
02:35:34.12 --> 02:35:41.08
but I read about it they have Herbert getting interviewed by Mike Wallace he kind of tells his story

1492
02:35:41.08 --> 02:35:49.32
and then out of the other room they bring major grim shot who was part of the unit who comes out and says yeah look

1493
02:35:49.32 --> 02:35:53.96
I worked for Herbert I know Herbert I respect Herbert but what he said isn't true

1494
02:35:57.88 --> 02:36:07.64
so so now who he's supposed to believe so Herbert sues Mike Wallace in 60 minutes for libel

1495
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:18.76
it's a 13 year court case it's a 13 year court case eventually gets all the way to supreme court

1496
02:36:18.76 --> 02:36:29.40
and Herbert loses the case Herbert eventually he became a clinical psychologist and also police

1497
02:36:29.40 --> 02:36:38.68
psychologists dies of cancer June 7th 2014

1498
02:36:46.84 --> 02:36:57.56
just the the whole thing is a travesty and I guess the best thing we can do is

1499
02:36:57.56 --> 02:37:07.000
what can we learn from it what can we learn from it I would say the obvious lesson here is

1500
02:37:08.12 --> 02:37:16.68
put your ego aside and build relationships with people now you might say well these people

1501
02:37:16.68 --> 02:37:22.52
were doing wrong okay so what what good do you do when you just build form an antagonist

1502
02:37:22.52 --> 02:37:27.16
relation could you have more influence over them or less influence over them you have less

1503
02:37:30.28 --> 02:37:35.72
so if you can build a relationship with people now listen this is again this is some freaking

1504
02:37:35.72 --> 02:37:38.60
hard this is what makes leadership part if these if there's people that are doing things that are

1505
02:37:38.60 --> 02:37:44.68
moral illegal and ethical okay what are you going to do you can do what Herbert did stand up to

1506
02:37:44.68 --> 02:37:47.08
him and guess what he gets fired now he has no influence over the situation

1507
02:37:47.08 --> 02:37:54.36
because if you think like you have to stop that that's my moral obligation to stop this

1508
02:37:54.36 --> 02:38:02.68
stuff from happening was did Colonel Herbert stop from happening no he said he's gone he has no

1509
02:38:02.68 --> 02:38:09.88
more influence who took over his baton some yes man when a Colonel Franklin's you know boys

1510
02:38:09.88 --> 02:38:27.64
that came in and started telling the party line so freaking disaster it's just a disaster you get

1511
02:38:27.64 --> 02:38:30.92
you get the high ground great you got the high ground and then you and then you

1512
02:38:30.92 --> 02:38:43.56
look down on people and you get an antagonistic relationship with him yeah and there's all

1513
02:38:43.56 --> 02:38:48.36
all the stuff is documented you got to read the book and I'm sure we could have more

1514
02:38:48.36 --> 02:38:52.76
discussions maybe we will maybe we'll bring some maybe we'll find somebody that was there

1515
02:38:52.76 --> 02:38:58.60
that knows more about it and now let's look there's two sides to every story too I mean you

1516
02:38:58.60 --> 02:39:03.48
are you pointed out you know what are they just trying to get the job done

1517
02:39:04.60 --> 02:39:13.80
is he was he exaggerating some of this I don't know I don't know my original take

1518
02:39:15.72 --> 02:39:21.40
was that this guy is like a hack my original information that I got was this guy was a

1519
02:39:21.40 --> 02:39:34.76
hack worth type individual from that was from from Colonel how his Herbert had worked for his

1520
02:39:34.76 --> 02:39:40.04
grandfather right so this is like a close to getting right now that we can go off of I don't know

1521
02:39:41.32 --> 02:39:47.72
I don't know I know that leadership is a freaking challenge I know that

1522
02:39:47.72 --> 02:39:51.88
and this book proves it

1523
02:40:00.20 --> 02:40:09.32
hate this feeling echo Charles the kind of empty feeling yeah sure don't like it yeah and so

1524
02:40:09.32 --> 02:40:16.28
I don't like when I can't really identify the truth I can't like it yeah and that's kind of why

1525
02:40:16.28 --> 02:40:21.96
I did think about that we're thinking about the other people's perspective you know

1526
02:40:24.12 --> 02:40:29.96
and with that kind of you kind of think like how did how did let's say that the guys like all

1527
02:40:29.96 --> 02:40:34.04
wrong like because let's face according to the story kind of sounds like they're almost like

1528
02:40:34.04 --> 02:40:41.32
corrupt almost where they're like hey who cares you know kind of thing so it's like what

1529
02:40:41.32 --> 02:40:50.12
was the what we just have a straight up corrupt military is that what you saying like in that little

1530
02:40:50.12 --> 02:40:57.56
but it's horrible for us to think that this entire division or this entire brigade at a minimum

1531
02:40:58.36 --> 02:41:07.08
was corrupt yeah and that's what I'm thinking but the reality is like so these aren't like bad people

1532
02:41:07.08 --> 02:41:11.96
like most people aren't just bad people who are just like destined for corruption or whatever

1533
02:41:11.96 --> 02:41:16.04
it's almost like you kind of got to consider how did they get there why is it like that it's not

1534
02:41:16.04 --> 02:41:20.36
because they're just these evil people who finally got there position of power and now can just

1535
02:41:20.36 --> 02:41:25.88
exploit weakness and nothing like that but you take and you put all these factors in place like

1536
02:41:25.88 --> 02:41:30.28
the fact that hey if you go do this tour you're going to get promoted you're going to get more money

1537
02:41:30.28 --> 02:41:33.96
you're you got to go do this and when you get over there well what's the best way to get a good

1538
02:41:33.96 --> 02:41:38.20
evaluation you get a good evaluation by doing whatever else is doing late you know you don't want to

1539
02:41:38.20 --> 02:41:42.68
stick your head up and be the one that gets draws a bunch of attention so if that's what we're doing

1540
02:41:42.68 --> 02:41:49.08
you know it's an expression that you use you use this expression that's what we're doing you know

1541
02:41:49.08 --> 02:41:54.04
like you'll say oh that's I thought that's just what we were doing yeah you use that expression sometimes

1542
02:41:54.60 --> 02:41:59.16
well that's a normal thing for people to feel look that's what we're doing okay that's what's

1543
02:41:59.16 --> 02:42:05.56
everyone else is doing I'm on okay yeah if we're gonna let the Vietnamese kind of run and do

1544
02:42:05.56 --> 02:42:08.92
whatever they want if that's what we're doing cool I don't want to be the one that's drawn a bunch

1545
02:42:08.92 --> 02:42:13.88
of attention myself they know about me so I'm just going to kind of sit back and let it happen yeah

1546
02:42:13.88 --> 02:42:20.04
so people getting that mode and you lose vision here's the other thing I can't much confidence

1547
02:42:20.04 --> 02:42:26.20
do you have in yourself to say like hey everyone here is wrong everyone here that's letting this

1548
02:42:26.20 --> 02:42:31.64
happen as wrong you know how do you not feel like wait a second there's you know a brigade of

1549
02:42:31.64 --> 02:42:36.44
5,000 people here and everyone's kind of down with what's happening and I'm the person that's not

1550
02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.48
there's something wrong here maybe it's wrong maybe there's something wrong with me yeah

1551
02:42:43.40 --> 02:42:52.20
and you get the momentum and the inertia of you get the inertia of hey hey we're going to get a new

1552
02:42:52.20 --> 02:42:55.32
Italian commander soon enough don't worry about this guy we got he's going to be going to do

1553
02:42:55.32 --> 02:43:01.32
here for six months what what are we trying to do make money right we can run these little scams and

1554
02:43:01.32 --> 02:43:07.24
make some money we we just want to have the time pass so I can move on I can just be done with my

1555
02:43:07.24 --> 02:43:13.08
job trust me that's that's a real thing even in today's military like have you ever heard

1556
02:43:13.08 --> 02:43:19.72
does zero defect zero defect model where it's like oh yeah we're gonna promote someone that has

1557
02:43:19.72 --> 02:43:24.20
had no mistakes so if you're over on deployment if you're an Iraq or you're an Afghanistan

1558
02:43:24.92 --> 02:43:32.44
and you want to get promoted and there's a mission to go do and you get to decide whether you

1559
02:43:32.44 --> 02:43:39.88
go do that mission or not do you think you should do it or not oh yeah got it yeah so if you don't

1560
02:43:39.88 --> 02:43:44.12
basically if you don't take that much action you don't want make that mean mistakes right

1561
02:43:44.12 --> 02:43:50.36
on you can have the zero defect record you have the zero defect record I went on deployment I did

1562
02:43:50.36 --> 02:43:58.76
four missions they all went well get a bronze star go home get a good evaluation and we're good to go

1563
02:44:00.04 --> 02:44:05.16
or I'm gonna go over there I'm gonna do a hundred missions every single one of those missions is

1564
02:44:05.16 --> 02:44:09.80
a freaking challenge and by the way if you're doing four missions you can kind of hand pick

1565
02:44:09.80 --> 02:44:15.48
like if you do 10 missions you do 20 missions you're hand pick okay this one's not bad not about

1566
02:44:15.48 --> 02:44:19.88
area we've got really good intel looks good all right go look go ahead and execute this one

1567
02:44:19.88 --> 02:44:25.24
all right if you're gonna do a hundred missions you're going okay look this one's a little bit more

1568
02:44:25.24 --> 02:44:31.48
high risk but we're gonna go it seems like a well-making impact will go executed there's a tendency

1569
02:44:31.48 --> 02:44:36.12
well not a tendency there's a possibility that you say you know what look I don't want to have

1570
02:44:36.12 --> 02:44:41.56
everyone get hurt I don't want to have any bad you know I don't have any negatives on my evaluation

1571
02:44:42.20 --> 02:44:47.64
I just want to get my job done to move on you know I want to punch the ticket so you end up doing

1572
02:44:47.64 --> 02:44:54.60
14 missions and you did your job good for you and now you get your ticket punched and you go home

1573
02:44:54.60 --> 02:44:59.000
and everyone's good and by the way when you get home because it was get rid of everyone says hey

1574
02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:05.32
he did it he was a he was a company commander he was a baton commander he did it you know he's a combat

1575
02:45:05.32 --> 02:45:09.88
experienced veteran as he said right so now are you kind of on a pedestal a little bit yeah

1576
02:45:09.88 --> 02:45:14.52
even though you really don't know anything so what I'm saying is the system even more so

1577
02:45:14.52 --> 02:45:21.48
in Vietnam was all set up where hey get over there keep your mouth shut go with the flow

1578
02:45:21.48 --> 02:45:26.92
fitting with the crew yeah and that's why hack worth had such a freaking issue with it and so did

1579
02:45:26.92 --> 02:45:33.56
herber makes sense so almost like they should maybe think about and I'm saying this with

1580
02:45:33.56 --> 02:45:38.92
complete ignorance by the way but they should change the little system to be you know like diving

1581
02:45:38.92 --> 02:45:44.20
you're much diving like I don't know Olympics or whatever diving right like platform whatever they have

1582
02:45:44.20 --> 02:45:50.60
they have a discord and the difficulty level exactly right so you get a score for difficulty level

1583
02:45:50.60 --> 02:45:56.20
and if the difficulty level is low you're not gonna get a high score you know yeah it's true and that's

1584
02:45:56.20 --> 02:46:05.08
fine again the system is really it's very easy for the system to fall back into a zero defect

1585
02:46:05.08 --> 02:46:12.84
mentality a risk of vers mentality because look I could go on to point it tomorrow and circumstances

1586
02:46:12.84 --> 02:46:17.96
could be that there's just not a lot going on and so we did four missions not because we want

1587
02:46:17.96 --> 02:46:23.08
aggressive but because there wasn't that many missions to do and so I'd come back and you can't look

1588
02:46:23.08 --> 02:46:26.84
down on me you can't say well joccal when we did four missions I did all the ones that I could

1589
02:46:26.84 --> 02:46:31.88
I was aggressive as I could possibly be we only did four you go on deployment there's you could

1590
02:46:31.88 --> 02:46:37.24
do a hundred missions but you only do four you come back sad as many as jocca were good to go and

1591
02:46:37.24 --> 02:46:43.000
I'm a overall leader I wasn't there so I'm looking at go hey I go did four jocquitted four hey

1592
02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:46.84
these guys are equivalent we're good to go move on meanwhile you were super risk of earth didn't

1593
02:46:46.84 --> 02:46:51.96
take any chances really didn't impact their battlefield and you're gonna get the same recognition

1594
02:46:51.96 --> 02:46:56.52
so it's a very difficult thing to do it's a very difficult thing then you can see you can see

1595
02:46:56.52 --> 02:47:03.64
that Vietnam just got so wrapped up in this this careerism of hey go do your time keep your mouth shut

1596
02:47:03.64 --> 02:47:09.40
getting you know go with the flow and that's that what are the missions that we're doing okay we're doing

1597
02:47:09.40 --> 02:47:15.000
that kind of mission cool oh got it we got guys smoking pot no one really seems to notice that

1598
02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:22.36
oh we're getting smoke and pot like it's just bad across the board and a lot of it has to do with what

1599
02:47:22.36 --> 02:47:29.16
is our mission what is our mission why what what what what means we want what means we want

1600
02:47:29.96 --> 02:47:33.80
if you don't even know what means you want how are you gonna you know if you went on a football field

1601
02:47:33.80 --> 02:47:37.16
and you didn't know what how if you didn't know how to score a goal what would you do

1602
02:47:39.40 --> 02:47:42.12
what would you do you wouldn't be able to do anything you wouldn't but as long as you know

1603
02:47:42.12 --> 02:47:46.60
hey here's where you're trying to get to okay got it give me that ball moving to foot down the

1604
02:47:46.60 --> 02:47:49.80
field I'm moving to yard down the field I'm moving and inch down the field you're at least

1605
02:47:49.80 --> 02:47:53.72
know which direction you're moving it if you get told hey go out on that field you know when

1606
02:47:53.72 --> 02:48:03.000
tells you where the end zone is right no no one tells you so what are you gonna do so as a leader

1607
02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.92
you gotta take that into account you gotta make sure people know what the mission is you gotta know what

1608
02:48:06.92 --> 02:48:17.48
the strategy is when you better know why you're going to war and you better make that perfectly

1609
02:48:17.48 --> 02:48:34.44
clear when you're going check empty feeling sorry don't like it all right so what else can we do

1610
02:48:34.44 --> 02:48:42.04
this is just a freaking well speaking of empty feelings I have one two three cans of empty

1611
02:48:42.60 --> 02:48:49.24
two and a half cans of empty just plain go some of the take this opportunity to tell our people

1612
02:48:49.24 --> 02:48:55.24
what does plain go is I'm glad because I'm just I had some two but I still feel I'm still so empty

1613
02:48:55.24 --> 02:49:00.28
alright hey it's all good well okay I won't start with discipline go how about that we'll just

1614
02:49:00.28 --> 02:49:05.40
talk about jockel fuel in general okay look we're on the path we're learning stuff lessons hard

1615
02:49:05.40 --> 02:49:16.04
any easy by the way obviously well you know how they say like there's hard lessons like the

1616
02:49:16.04 --> 02:49:21.64
hard lessons are the ones that are learned like the best yes true he who suffers remembers

1617
02:49:22.84 --> 02:49:29.64
yeah yeah so boom so we're on the path right we're looking for lessons we're learning from lessons

1618
02:49:29.64 --> 02:49:35.80
learning from lessons from others that's one of those efficiency things yeah there's some great

1619
02:49:35.80 --> 02:49:39.64
leadership lessons in the both these books that's for sure like some read like that thing about

1620
02:49:39.64 --> 02:49:44.92
planning if you let your team come up with a plan they're invested they have a material interest in

1621
02:49:44.92 --> 02:49:49.72
seeing the plants succeed that right there's gold read those books look you come away feeling empty

1622
02:49:49.72 --> 02:49:54.84
like I did let me fill in that whole little bit there I just did I just filled in my own hole in my

1623
02:49:54.84 --> 02:49:59.24
heart for getting to the end of this book by saying hey if you let your team come up with a plan

1624
02:49:59.24 --> 02:50:04.84
if they have a material interest in making the plan succeed there you go I feel better already

1625
02:50:04.84 --> 02:50:13.64
me too so yes the last one the path and through that path a lot of people know about the path

1626
02:50:13.64 --> 02:50:20.44
they don't walk the path I saw that meme today since I'm in my head but when we when we do walk the path

1627
02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:28.04
we may need assistance assistance through whether it be mentorship guidance or supplementation

1628
02:50:28.04 --> 02:50:35.80
yeah it's for supplementation goes we have jockel fuel so we got stuff for joints we got stuff for protein we

1629
02:50:35.80 --> 02:50:44.92
got stuff for a brain and we got stuff for immunity that's it right more or less or I'm just getting

1630
02:50:44.92 --> 02:50:50.04
stronger with the moke yes that's the protein that's the original product oh yeah so and here's the

1631
02:50:50.04 --> 02:50:55.56
thing thank you to about something else I understand for here's the thing here's the formula for

1632
02:50:55.56 --> 02:51:01.32
getting strong could you tell I was like not with you yeah okay I'm just making sure I'm very used to that

1633
02:51:02.92 --> 02:51:08.76
dynamic you usually I'm paying attention well depends on what you mean by usually but true

1634
02:51:09.64 --> 02:51:16.36
anyway the formula for getting strong that if you've sensed that for me it should be a non-verbal

1635
02:51:16.36 --> 02:51:21.56
cue to talk fast and kind of rap yeah I thought that in the beginning but now you don't care

1636
02:51:21.56 --> 02:51:26.28
there while yeah it's just what I don't care I'm very used to you have no material interested moving

1637
02:51:26.28 --> 02:51:33.24
it's gonna be a long which is fine I'm a material interest but it's very small nonetheless okay

1638
02:51:33.24 --> 02:51:43.16
the material formula for being strong is three things the correct exercise the correct

1639
02:51:43.16 --> 02:51:51.56
rest in recovery and the correct fuel nutrition slash fuel slash food if you'll ever yeah moke

1640
02:51:52.28 --> 02:51:57.64
is part of that last part the fuel forgetting strong seem saying so yeah moke will make you

1641
02:51:57.64 --> 02:52:02.60
strong as long as those other two things are in places well sure anyway go to jockelfuel.com for all

1642
02:52:02.60 --> 02:52:09.08
these things score score some supplementation for this path that we are walking not just knowing

1643
02:52:09.08 --> 02:52:15.72
you can also get a vitamin shop you can also get it at wallaw well you can get the

1652
02:53:07.16 --> 02:53:12.28
earned that's it right yep it's kind of thing is more of a framing thing okay not to go too deep on
