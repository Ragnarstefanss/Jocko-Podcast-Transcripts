and I have tears rolling down my face as I'm like reading the book I'm like you have your kid and me now if anybody knows me well, it's not a surprise like you know a emotional person you know one of my real close friends is one of my black people so Matt Waltman and he He just knows he's like bro, he's like I know when you're gonna get emotional If you listen to a podcast amount he's like yep, and then I'll get emotional just if you know me I don't like You don't get it like how do you keep on I'm like I love I literally love what I'm doing and it was like the same thing He's like wait just wait hold like hold like all and I'll study like JP activate. and I was like hey, you're following him now because I followed you You gave him back to them like I was like why was this that I'm like you look like he's being shadowed It starts like looking through all your stuff. She was dead serious like just like this is going to be horrible like body posture like like go down to the side like And so we go through this whole talk and that you know I said hey, I know one of you guys have to leave because it's actually your your teammate I said you guys have hit all the training objectives and so we can be done and this would be a good day training Or we can do one more run and we can do it to honor this gentleman that just got killed Because I'm telling you right now leadership is what's gonna solve every problem within this organization If we pulled the thread there was a leadership failure somewhere that allowed this complacency to creep in and this individual just got killed Because what this guy was doing he had done thousands of times over his career It was literally thousands of times and so we finished the run we finished today strong That was a Friday We had another week with them that we're supposed to do at the end of that month Two days later we get an email from the leaderships and hey, we'd like to talk to you guys about You know some stuff We're testing a bruiser all the other stuff doesn't matter Like this is who we are and this is what we're going to do and I like to also tie that in When I'm talking about Ramadi, you know when we talk about like hey, well you come back from the point when we talk about the cost and the burden and all that stuff I tried to make it very clear when I'm talking with individuals or large groups like We're all gonna have those dark times we're all gonna have those things from our past that could hold us back if we allow them to Like if they're not doing something right, make sure we're not being like, hey, you know, get on to them like we would team guys and Marines because team guys and Marines are very good at going back to that default of like, hey, you stupid. Yes, which is awesome and continuing to see success after success after success that's That's another great example of the many companies that we work with that go out there It take these principles implement them and dominate yeah, and it shows them one thing that I've written down I wanted to hit is the importance of like Like the diversity of people's like different people's ideas and backgrounds That's one thing I was talking like a company. We don't know what's causing it and then COVID hit and I hit up my Malika she was like, hey, you need to get these treatments for your TBIs and I'm like, okay, yeah, because you know Real bad tonight is and you know just Issues with just remembering stuff and headaches and stuff like that and Problems sleeping and she just been trying to get me in the treatment. Like you know, a basic student thing like it should have been like 20 push-ups or you know, make them like jump in the pool with your gear and come back out and go. well what's interesting about that is this this training program In situations like this which I've seen and you've seen when it goes Beyond Business application beyond the combat application obviously beyond the business application and it starts to get into people souls and sitting there listening to people debrief seeing grown men Seeing you know women apologizing for behavior that they know they they shouldn't have done and it was negatively impactful to their family like seeing those deeper those deeper changes That's always it's always amazing to see that this stuff applies and gets through gets through the people's souls it does I mean One of our larger field train exercise clients one of their upper executives You know the company I'm talking about everyone that we've been interacting with since 2018 run these FTXs all of those key leaders So we go we give the class and then we let them have fun like our hey shoot the guns like shoot them as fast as you can here's how you reload it we teach them how to put like a basic patrol and I always tell them like, hey guys these are not tactics these are the basics. All right, so those means where people were like this is my body like with all the checklights like That was you me I trade at me on the outside and sales of financial company It's been me for a long time, but not anymore that you're like They're like just it's incredible What those treatments do and actually to the point that One of our clients that I should on a front that's a part of Dave's LDAP program that we did an FTX for One of the guys is like, hey, what's a good charity that we can donate to and I told them America's mighty warriors This is what they're doing Well, one of these team members was so motivated because I told them what happened to me Other members like Cowell who's on our team a he went got those treatments He said it's been a game change night and day And we explained them like hey That problem is a leadership problem that is a leadership problem and you allow complacency to creep in People get offended at first They they get offended, but then we kind of changed the tone like let's pull the thread If we pull the thread enough it goes back to a leadership problem that allowed the complacency to creep in Because if we go to war with that complacency and we combat it and we do what we're supposed to do we mitigate all those things That's what we talk about being default aggressive as what we tell people hey default aggressive isn't and mindset for victory against another human being Now in combat yes, but we're not talking about that We're talking about being default aggressive to improve a relationship Work on your communication being default aggressive to mitigate safety risks and if you're Not allowing that complacency creep in because Of the leadership that you have because the culture culture is an ultimate form of decentralized command It is very disturbing It is very very disturbing and to that degree where they can wear someone and I'm totally dispaculating But they'll hear you say something that they didn't like like Somewhere else and then be like let me go to his Instagram And shadow it really makes me start to think about all the level of Interconnectivity between some of these elements out there and it's Because it is very strange now look could it be like Like, like, you're stoner, be like, Roger, you know, like, no handle that shit. I'm like that's a lot I was like I know a lot of bad ass females that run companies that are kicking ass I know a lot of bad ass female leaders in the military that did some phenomenal things I'm like don't. and he said hey One of our guys just got killed on a job site and it brought me back to when when Seth was like hey Mark just got killed It brought me right back to them and I remember sitting on the wall That's all I could think about is just like I didn't think I was dealing with this stuff anymore I don't have I could not Make something like that and sell it to people I couldn't yeah as far as I'm concerned I might as well be a drug dealer that that that is a drug dealer that is it that is a person that is Given freaking crystal meth and fedemine to people and and knowing that they're gonna get a dick to do it Knowing that you're hurting the health probably gonna kill them and you don't care because I'm making money I could not do that from a moral standpoint as a human couldn't do it zero chance and yet I kind of felt like I got to do something because otherwise people are out there They're visiting the meth dealers So I talked with Carlos and Cody like we give the intel pull them aside on my k we just keep an eye on her we need to like pour into her because she thinks it's going to be horrible like we need to make sure she gets the burden. I'm like what do you got like this is like this is the time for let's talk through it as if you're comfortable if you're comfortable with it she goes well for my past. and You got some smart guys you got some educated guys you got some uneducated guys you got some short guys some tall guys some slow guys some fast guys You got somebody that was born with a silver spoon in their mouth You got someone that was raised in the ghetto you got all these different people with all these different perspectives and That makes that platoon strong. But I also know that because I have that background perspective I do at times a peeled a larger base Then some of the other instructors because I can relate to all the different levels and I and I get that so I want to be when I'm like talking through this stuff I want to be I don't think I was just phenomenal like perfect leader in the military I was a Good team guy. So we want to make sure they know what we're talking about and Carlos is going to if somebody pops up the middle We have to shoot like what would you be able to shoot them and it's all every single time Like the client who has zero tactical training goes It's like hey, what was What was your biggest takeaway that you're gonna Leave this training with the implement back home and hers was you know same thing like I'm not gonna let my past define me This is this is what I've been looking for came to a monster pay for some guys to go to the monster with them Came back was like hey, we want to engage with you guys We did a we did a little trial FTX with with a bunch of their leaders and when they saw that FTX are like Okay, we need this I won't get into all the details of how they run their business and what they're doing so immediately I'm like there's something there like there's something deeper there obviously for her to be like she was not thrilled and just thought it was going to be bad. But this shitty chief that was in charge of us just completely, like even though Bobby was like kind of Raymy back and I was like, okay, yeah, And so I said all right, you know you guys kind of let me know I'll give you guys some time to kind of think about it and everyone's kind of like checking and they're talking and there's a few people crying
