[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 142 with echo Charles and me, Jockelwillink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:10] SLA Marshall could be a bragher of the first order. I could write on toilet paper with a crayon and
[00:00:18] cellet was a routine boast, but his favorite claim to fame was at first the most puzzling to me.
[00:00:24] Years later the most significant in terms of unraveling the hustler and the phony that he was,
[00:00:30] and how he was nonetheless able to make such a mark on the US Army. SLAAM regularly brought
[00:00:36] up the fact that the army had made him a general despite his never having attended even one military
[00:00:42] school and that he was the only general in the army to have this distinction. He neglected to say
[00:00:48] and never would have had a not followed up out of sheer curiosity that he'd gotten his star not
[00:00:54] in the regular army, but in the reserves. Meanwhile, with no reason not to believe him, I accepted
[00:01:00] SLAAM's story of World War I. His experiences as an infantryman in all the major campaigns,
[00:01:07] his battlefield commission to become the youngest second lieutenant in the US Army during the war,
[00:01:12] the romantic tale he spun of armistice day when he saw in the end of the war sharing his
[00:01:18] canteens with his brigade commander in the trenches. With no reason not to believe him,
[00:01:24] I accepted SLAAM's tales of World War II, too. His participation in the fighting in the Pacific,
[00:01:29] as well as his service in Europe, which had him in the front line of the Normandy invasion.
[00:01:35] It would be many, many, many years in which SLAAM repeated the stories endlessly in which his
[00:01:42] reputation was only further bolstered as one or the other appeared in everything from current
[00:01:48] biography 1953 to the obituary upon his death in 1977, and in his autobiography published two
[00:01:56] years later before I would discover it was all a lie. SLAAM had been an enlisted man
[00:02:03] with the 315th engineers, 90th infantry division during World War I, and spent his time not fighting
[00:02:10] as an infantryman, but repairing French road roads until just before the wars end. He had not
[00:02:17] been battlefield commissioned, and he wasn't anywhere near the trenches on 11 November 1918,
[00:02:23] in being instead at the Army, France based officer candidate school, then called infantry
[00:02:29] candidate school, the self-proclaimed youngest lieutenant in World War I who, in fact, never served
[00:02:35] an officer in any outfit regular or reserved in any capacity ever was not commissioned until April
[00:02:42] 1919 long after the last angry shots were fired. According to his service record,
[00:02:49] SLAAM saw no infantry combat in World War II, either, although he was awarded a CIB for the
[00:02:55] Marshall Islands campaign while serving on the DA staff, and far from being on the ground from
[00:03:01] the earliest hours of the 6 June 1944 Normandy invasion, SLAAM didn't even arrive in the European
[00:03:08] Thirit Theatre until July, and then it was as a staff officer slash historian reconstructing
[00:03:15] the operation, and while SLAAM would speak with pride of being the only American soldier to serve
[00:03:21] in all four of America's great wars in the 20th century. It was a claim more than a little deceptive.
[00:03:28] His Korean war experience covered exactly three months, December of 1950 to February 1951,
[00:03:34] when he was recalled from the reserve to active duty as a historian slash operations analysis
[00:03:41] for the 8th Army, a stint for his country that produced the river and the gauntlet for himself,
[00:03:47] and his service in Vietnam was undertaken as a six-year retire reserve general and a 40-year
[00:03:54] experienced journalist. SLAAM's job when he wasn't wearing a khaki, looking for a story on the Army's
[00:04:00] tab. A historian as careless with his own history as SLAAM Marshall was could hardly be a careful
[00:04:08] historian and Marshall proved the rule. Veterans of many of the actions he documented in his books
[00:04:15] have complained bitterly over the years of the inaccuracy or blatant bias.
[00:04:22] With it although the truth was that SLAAM was a fallen and irrevocably smashed idol in my eyes.
[00:04:29] He knew I'd grown away from him throughout our time together, but it was not something to discuss.
[00:04:34] I cherished my career too much to risk getting on his bad side, and I was opportunistic enough
[00:04:41] to see the value of my staying on the good side. But there must have been many like me,
[00:04:47] whose silence in the face of SLAAM's power only added to it and gave credence to his dubious expertise,
[00:04:54] who allowed him to have an observed amount of influence which fed his ego and lined his purse.
[00:05:00] And for years did an incalculable horrific disservice to the Army, the thing he professed to love
[00:05:07] above all, not to mention to the nation and to the men who fought and died in Vietnam.
[00:05:14] When General Johnson had warned me to take care with SLAAM, he is the Army's powerful friend,
[00:05:20] but he can be a treacherous enemy. I had not understood what he meant. But when I finally did,
[00:05:26] I understood too that the Chief of Staff had gotten it backwards. The reality was that SLAAM Marshall
[00:05:32] was the Army's powerful enemy because he was its most treacherous friend. And if he were alive
[00:05:40] today, perhaps even more than the Vietnam-era generals who determinedly maintained we won the war,
[00:05:47] we lost in their hands. SLAAM Marshall would have plenty to answer for.
[00:05:53] That right there is a section from my favorite book about face by Colonel David Hackworth.
[00:06:03] And he's talking about his experience with a guy by the name of SLA Marshall,
[00:06:08] otherwise known as SLAM, SLAM Marshall. And that's a pretty devastating opening. That's a pretty
[00:06:16] devastating opening. You can hear what his career was. So there's a lot of
[00:06:23] negativity around SLA Marshall. And for me coming from Hackworth, that's basically all I need to hear.
[00:06:31] That's all I need to hear is when Hackworth goes and so Hackworth works with him and did a
[00:06:39] torn Vietnam with him, they were going around documenting things and he got to know him. And at
[00:06:44] first he kind of idolized him and he'll talk about that a little bit. But that's one of the things
[00:06:51] that Hack mentions in about face was that he had this huge impact on the army. And
[00:07:00] Hack says that he used to read his books over and over again. And so it's kind of a weird
[00:07:05] dichotomy there is that Hack got information from some of SLA Marshall's famous books that he wrote
[00:07:13] about combat. But then he turned out to not have told the truth. So one of the books that
[00:07:24] he talks about that he read a bunch is a book called Men Against Fire. And it's based on his
[00:07:30] interviews and reporting on World War II. And that book made some claims. And some of the claims
[00:07:35] that the book made are just patently untrue. Just law there. Just not true. And the biggest of the lies.
[00:07:46] Is that right to call the light? The biggest of the claims. Maybe it's a lie. The biggest of the
[00:07:52] untruths will call it that. The biggest of the untruths revolves around this notion that SLA
[00:07:58] Marshall presents that in combat only about 15% of the soldiers on the battlefield in combat actually
[00:08:06] fires a weapons at all. 15%. Now that's a really strange thing to say. Now and knowing what I know
[00:08:18] now I think he may have done that for a couple of reasons. And I'm not making excuses. I'm saying
[00:08:24] this is why I think he would do that because there's no excuse for doing this. The first is I think he
[00:08:30] wanted to have a theory or a hypothesis that was like kind of shocking and would gain him
[00:08:37] simplicity. Right? That's a shocking thing. When you hear hey in combat only 15% of people fire
[00:08:42] their weapons. Right? You're going, what are you talking about? That's crazy. So I think he wanted
[00:08:47] to have something to discuss that would bring him out to the limelight. You know, the shocking
[00:08:52] claim. And second, I think he saw that there was an actual problem. Right? That maybe not as many people
[00:09:02] shot their weapons in combat as should. And he wanted to fix that problem. So it was at 85% of the
[00:09:10] people that weren't shooting the weapon? No. But maybe the number was a decent percentage that
[00:09:15] didn't shoot or could have shot more. Is that possible? Yeah, I could say that that's possible. Maybe
[00:09:19] not as many people were, not as many people were shooting as you would have liked. So that's why I
[00:09:29] think he got focused on that particular subject. And I think the normal human life things, right?
[00:09:34] I think he had a big ego, which actually I don't think he did. He had a big ego. He was insecure.
[00:09:39] I think he made up some of these other stories, which are horrible to make up stories about
[00:09:44] your combat experiences. It's a big mistake. I think this is, you know, in many ways, this is like
[00:09:49] one of the first documented cases of stolen valor, right? And obviously I don't like stolen valor.
[00:09:54] So there's a lot of negativity around SLA Marshall. And I have to be careful because
[00:10:02] I, it's very easy for me to throw the baby out with the bath water, right? And when you,
[00:10:10] you know, okay, so I'm here to learn, right? And despite these very, very significant
[00:10:17] character shortfalls, here's the facts, the books that hero guided the military and had a significant
[00:10:24] impact on military leaders for many years, including hackworth, including hackworth. So
[00:10:34] eventually I had to look and see what is in these books and what if anything I could learn from the
[00:10:44] books? And I think, from my perspective, okay, so he did massive amounts of interviews with people.
[00:10:52] And he did have, you know, he was, okay, he was an indie day. He was there a month later,
[00:10:59] interviewing people, finding out what happened. So he talked to a lot of people. And I think his
[00:11:04] perspective and same thing with World War I, he wasn't there, but he was close to it. And he
[00:11:09] talked to a lot of people. And then he spent his time in the Pacific theater and he spent time
[00:11:13] in Korea. So he had perspective. It's not the perspective that he claimed to have. And if he would have
[00:11:17] been smart and just said, look, I wasn't on the front lines, but I talked to a lot of people.
[00:11:20] I have, I wasn't a military, I have a good perspective. Here's what I've learned. If you were to
[00:11:25] said that, it would have been fine. Unfortunately, he didn't say that. Do we throw the baby out with
[00:11:32] the bath water? The, the, my initial, like, gut reaction is yes, flyer, right? Right? Hey,
[00:11:41] no, I'm not going to listen this guy. But I have to think about it. If this book influenced the military
[00:11:48] so much and this book in particular with the book is, is men against fire is the big book that he wrote.
[00:11:52] I say the big book, it's the book that he wrote after World War II. I think it came out in 1947.
[00:11:58] And it's, it had a big influence. And I can tell you that I had a big influence. It had a big
[00:12:05] influence. And this is what's funny. It had a big influence because despite so I guess the facts about his
[00:12:11] career came out after he died. He died in 1977 and the facts came out some years after that, right?
[00:12:18] I would hear quotes from SLA Marshall all the time when I was in. This guy is a known liar.
[00:12:29] Again, maybe that's a harsh word, but he did not tell the truth. And you know, when it comes to
[00:12:34] like making up what you did in combat, you kind of kind of earned yourself the the name liar.
[00:12:40] So the guy lied. And yet I would hear quotes from what he said and what he taught and what he
[00:12:49] thought and a lot of it made sense, right? So okay, is it true that a even a broken clock is right
[00:12:58] twice a day? That's still a pretty small percentage. But I'd hear quotes from SLA Marshall that
[00:13:05] were correct. And it wasn't a small number of quotes. And so I think despite his ego, despite his
[00:13:11] lying, he had a lot of good, he had gathered a lot of good information and talked to enough people
[00:13:17] that he actually started to make sense and he saw people in multiple different wars. Again,
[00:13:21] did he see it to the degree that he claimed to? No. But you know, there's, there's a lot of
[00:13:26] military historians that were never in any kind of combat whatsoever. That were never even in the
[00:13:31] military. There's there's plenty of very respected. I've got books in the queue and I don't know if
[00:13:38] I'll ever cover them, but I've got books in the queue that are great books about war and about the
[00:13:42] military that were written by people that were never in the military. There's military theorists that
[00:13:46] were never in the military that I have a great deal of respect for. So then that they say sensible things.
[00:13:54] So is there a question of character? Yes, are we going to throw the baby out of the bath water?
[00:13:59] I'm going to try not to. I'm going to try and see what we can learn. And I think from when I read
[00:14:05] this book, and I read this book a long time ago and I don't know
[00:14:11] anyways, I got stuff out of it. And I think there's actually, I'm going to tell you, I think there's
[00:14:17] actually a lot to get out of this book. And if nothing else, it reflects
[00:14:21] and reinforces some lessons and brings some other ones. We paint them a little bit more clearly.
[00:14:27] So without further ado, and I found myself as I was reviewing this book again,
[00:14:35] like about halfway through it, I totally forgot that it was this guy that I
[00:14:39] consider a liar, right? I got over that, right? Because I'm thinking to have that make sense. Yes,
[00:14:43] that does that. And he's pulling in quotes from military leaders. And yeah, yeah, that's
[00:14:49] are you with me? I mean, doesn't make sense? It makes 100% sense because remember back in the day,
[00:14:53] remember Millie Vanilli? Remember that? Those are that group. Oh, you guys are the two guys. Yes,
[00:14:58] so they were liars. Yeah, because in that way, yeah, so it wasn't them singing and all this stuff,
[00:15:05] as it turns out, as it turns out, but when they were on the radio and stuff,
[00:15:08] everyone liked that, you know, blaming on the rain and whatever. Did they,
[00:15:12] did they recover? They did not recover from their situation. Negative. And I, SLA Marshall was dead.
[00:15:18] Yeah, well, one of the guys committed suicide in Millie Vanilli. He was like, you know,
[00:15:22] you got heavy, but nonetheless, the point is, it's like, yeah, it's not them singing it,
[00:15:27] you know, their liars are whatever, but the songs were kind of dope. That's the thing.
[00:15:31] So, you know, it's one same deal. So I get like Marshall Millie Vanilli. It's same thing. Same
[00:15:36] same situation right here. I'm saying, if you put on one of the Vanilli, Millie Vanilli songs
[00:15:40] right now, don't bring it right back, you know, the dance or whatever, and you know, it's still good.
[00:15:45] It's good. So you had a liard that you take the guys that actually sang it or why don't you teach
[00:15:49] those two guys how to sing is that how that are to sing? Yes. So one time, not to go too deep into it,
[00:15:54] but they tried to make it was to do a podcast about Millie Vanilli out of here.
[00:15:57] They went into it. And they were like, hey, we think you could because they messed up on stage.
[00:16:02] Right. That's how they got to taste the skip. Yeah. And well, and so they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:16:08] they panic. They ran off stage all the stuff. They could have just been like, yeah, we're lip
[00:16:12] syncing for that show. But then I forgot how they handled it. But then people were like, hey,
[00:16:17] how long did you take the guy to kill himself? Oh, long time. Here's, you know, they got exposed
[00:16:21] and all this stuff. Yeah. But he was just, and so they're like, um, they're like, no, we'll prove it,
[00:16:27] you know? And then so the people came in and listened to him like actually singing the thing.
[00:16:31] It was like, oh my god, not even close. These guys can't even sing. You know,
[00:16:36] it's, you got to tell the truth about what's going on, man. You got to. And that's the thing,
[00:16:40] like, just like I said, like, why not just get here that the people who were really saying those songs,
[00:16:45] they were older people. They were like old, like 50s or something like that. Like, so they didn't have
[00:16:50] the pop culture kind of feel. So they were less marketable. But they did just hire a couple, like,
[00:16:56] vocalists. I mean, how bad can those guys sing terrible. Oh, the real guys. Oh, man. Yeah, you
[00:17:03] can watch the little documentary thing. What I was like, good. And they have thick German accents,
[00:17:07] too. That's the thing too. Yeah, they're from Germany. Oh, so it's like it's a night and day. They're different.
[00:17:13] And but the real people who sang it, they're like, like I said, like, old, you know, funky,
[00:17:16] like kind of jazz type people from what I remember. There is less marco. But just like how you said,
[00:17:22] sure they're less marketable. But man, they're putting out some pretty cool songs. I mean,
[00:17:27] yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know. The marketing, I think that's a big part of it. I don't know,
[00:17:31] man. But I mean, you are right. You know, it's weird. It's also because the stuff that stuff that
[00:17:36] S.L.A. Marshall says in this book, he's making, he's making statements that they stand on their own.
[00:17:43] You don't need, you know, to be able to say, look, I was here. So therefore what I'm saying,
[00:17:49] you should listen to. Like, no, the the value of what you're saying should stand on its own.
[00:17:54] He don't need to be, you don't need to be a have some certain experience. You know, it's like
[00:17:59] life. And I talk about, and I would say, you can't, if you're trying to prove a tactic to someone,
[00:18:07] like if I say, hey, when you get in the situation, here's what you should do. I shouldn't say,
[00:18:10] because this is how we did it when I was in Baghdad or when I was in a mod or whatever, or when I was
[00:18:16] in nom, like, no, here's the tactic and look at how it performs. Go and do a trial run,
[00:18:22] go and do some force on force training. You'll see that the tactic works. And S.L.A.
[00:18:26] Marshall, smart guy, great writer, got, you know, could have said, hey, here's these tactics that I
[00:18:32] learned from these other people that just got out of it. And that wasn't good. That's a little
[00:18:37] even thing, isn't it? Just wasn't good enough for them. Didn't you guys have a name for that
[00:18:40] one, someone must let out? Yeah, yeah, we we we we we we we we we just when I was in Baghdad. Yeah,
[00:18:47] when I was in Baghdad, like, when I was in Baghdad, we did it like this. Yeah. And you can't stand.
[00:18:52] You can't stand on that, right? Is it good to have experience and say, hey, look, when I was in Baghdad,
[00:18:56] this is how we did it, perhaps we should try it this way. That's one thing. But to say, when I was in Baghdad,
[00:19:02] this is how we did it. So that's how is the best way to do it, which is just not true. It's not true.
[00:19:07] Things evolve. The the fundamental principles of combat leadership don't change, but the tactics that
[00:19:13] you use can definitely model. You have to modify your tactics. The enemies can modify their
[00:19:17] tactics. So you have to adjust as well. And so to rely on your personal experience as how you
[00:19:24] bolster your arguments is wrong. It's it's a it's an additive, right? It's it's good to say,
[00:19:31] hey, look, I've done this before. And this is a good way. I'm in a ride situation where I was
[00:19:37] teaching how to go over the beach with boats, right? And I brought up some things and I said,
[00:19:44] hey, look, I've done and I had happened to have done multiple deployments on a ship. And when you're
[00:19:51] on a ship, you go over the beach a lot. And going over the beaches, a complicated operation.
[00:19:54] I don't care. There's no easy way to do it, man. You got gear that's going to flood out and you
[00:19:59] got waves. You got tied. You got surf. You got sand. You got salt water. It's a nightmare. And
[00:20:04] that's one of the things that makes the seals good is that we have to do this. So when you go,
[00:20:08] you knew insert any other way. It's freaking easy. Like you step off a helicopter. Everything's fine.
[00:20:13] You see, you know, you you you you you get dropped out of a vehicle. Everything's fine. You come
[00:20:19] over the beach. Everything is a disaster. There's salt everywhere. There's water everywhere. Everything's
[00:20:23] flooded and broken and you're freezing cold. It's just sucks. And that's that's our normal mode of
[00:20:27] operation is right there. So everything else seems easy. But I had a guy that was saying, don't,
[00:20:33] don't ever bring the boats in. And I totally disagreed with that. It was like, well, it you have to
[00:20:45] think about what you're going to do. It's basically what I'm saying. You have to think about what you're
[00:20:49] going to do. If you can avoid if the boats come in and they flip, it's a real problem. Right. It's a real
[00:20:55] problem. If there's a surf, it's a real problem. And you need to have like elements ready to just
[00:21:01] handle the boats. Because if something goes wrong, so you can't you have to really think about what you're
[00:21:06] doing. Anyways, I almost fell back on the like look, I've done this. I've done over the beach
[00:21:13] over and over again. I know the deal. Right. It's like, no, no, actually, because the deal is many times
[00:21:18] when you look at the surf and you go, you know what, we need to swim in. It's going to suck,
[00:21:23] but we need to swim in because risking the boats going through. And there's two, there's two
[00:21:28] things that are pulling at you. The waves are big, right? You're thinking, hey, we better get the boats
[00:21:32] to bring us in. That's actually counterintuitive. Because the waves are big, man, you flip a boat over
[00:21:36] and you got, you're just a disaster. It's a disaster. So anyways, I almost relied on the, hey,
[00:21:45] this is the way we did it. And I've done this a bunch. And it's like, no, that's not merit. You have to
[00:21:49] be like, explain, okay, here's what can happen. Here's the problems. And here's, and there's problems for
[00:21:52] both of us. There's times where you swim in. There's times where you don't. But you have to understand
[00:21:55] why you're making that decision. You can't just blank it a decision. Because it gets sketchy. All right,
[00:22:01] anyways, this is a big introduction to SLA Marshall. Here we go. I got to say one more thing.
[00:22:10] Bro, and in your life and we've written two books about our experiences. They're not, they're
[00:22:15] they've leadership books, but you know, we make it very clear that like, hey, this is our
[00:22:20] memory to the best of our ability. But there's some things that you just don't,
[00:22:24] you, you, you, if you don't know something, you shouldn't make a claim. But there's something like,
[00:22:28] you know, if you were participating in D day, you don't mess up that fact. Like, for me to be like,
[00:22:35] hey, I, oh, yeah, I was on that mission. And so I'm going to be like, oh, well, actually you weren't.
[00:22:40] Maybe like, well, when was it? And, well, I did whatever. I was on 100 operations. Oh, I don't know
[00:22:46] if it's on that one or that. Well, you know, you know, like, it's understood, right? People make mistakes.
[00:22:50] People, your memory, it fades with memory. I think late for night. I mean, we, in both the
[00:22:54] intros to extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership, we spelled out, you know, this is to the best of our
[00:22:58] memory. This isn't a historical document. And we, you know, at some point, I'm sure we'll go back and
[00:23:04] and actually get the dates and explain every single thing that happened by date and who is there
[00:23:09] in what experience took place. Like, yeah, that would be good to have. And especially now,
[00:23:14] it's probably, it's all unclassified now because it's been a long time. But the kind of errors that he's
[00:23:21] making in are like, I was at D-Day or I was in the trenches with my brigade commander on the
[00:23:30] day that world war one ended. Like, that's not a small, like your memory is not going to forget that,
[00:23:37] right? It's just not going to happen. So, tell the truth. And what sucks is, this is what sucks.
[00:23:45] If you don't tell the truth, you discredit everything that you've said that actually is truthful.
[00:23:51] That's the problem with this book. That's the problem with this book. Everything that,
[00:23:55] it basically, you could take this book and throw it in the garbage can and no one could really
[00:23:58] argue with you. Oh, that guy lied about a bunch of stuff. Okay. Well, throw it in the garbage can. I get it.
[00:24:01] Yeah. And if it wasn't for the fact that hack actually had learned a ton from this book,
[00:24:08] I would be like, well, well, throwing the garbage. But if you learned from it, and then used what
[00:24:14] he learned from it to implement in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, it's like, okay, you know what,
[00:24:19] I'm going to pay attention to it. That's a rough time. This is a rough time. It took me a long time
[00:24:25] to decide to cover this book, actually. Yeah. In that crazy makes sense, though. Totally makes sense.
[00:24:30] Wait, makes sense that it took a long time and it makes sense that we're here right now with book and hand.
[00:24:34] Both. Okay. I mean, more the long time thing. Of course, yeah, you got to consider. Just like that.
[00:24:37] Well, there's like a reporter, like a news reporter who's like Sadie was in a helicopter and it got to fire.
[00:24:45] And all that was Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Yeah. She took sniper fire coming. Right.
[00:24:49] So there was a reporter that did that too. Yeah. It was like a legit reporter. Yeah.
[00:24:53] And then he said like he did took all this stuff and they were like, well, I was in the helicopter.
[00:24:57] Like two helicopters behind the camera. You know, you know, meanwhile, yes, I'm good stuff.
[00:25:03] Yeah. You shouldn't have said that, you know, just like I said, you should. You don't have to say all that.
[00:25:06] You know, there's something else that happens. This catches people when it comes to storytelling.
[00:25:11] Okay. I'm going to explain this. If I'm telling you a story about something taking place
[00:25:20] and I'm not a great storyteller, I want you to feel how I felt.
[00:25:25] Hmm. So if I say to you, like, let's say I got a mortar that exploded 50 yards from me.
[00:25:34] 50 yards. I'm pretty safe. Could I get fractured? I could get fract, but I'm pretty safe.
[00:25:39] It's still pretty shocking. Whoa. It's blower. Boom. And when that first mortar hit you, like, oh,
[00:25:45] wait, is another mortar going to hit me? What's going on? Well, when I tell you, hey, a mortar hit
[00:25:52] and hit 50 meters from me, I'm thinking, well, that doesn't really convey how I felt at that moment.
[00:25:59] Yeah. So you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to cut that down with. I had this mortar hit 10
[00:26:03] meters from me. And now you're thinking, oh, dang. Like, even you, I can see it on your face. You get it now.
[00:26:09] So in order for me to try and convey the emotions that I actually felt, people start to adjust.
[00:26:16] And you've got to be careful that. I don't think they're doing it intentionally. You know,
[00:26:20] I, I just put myself in check. Like, okay, I need to tell a good story, but I need to keep the facts straight.
[00:26:28] Yeah. Right. sketchy. Yeah. That's the thing. The facts. So there's a difference between saying,
[00:26:33] hey, this was the biggest explosion you'd ever seen in your life. You know, like saying that is
[00:26:38] different than like this explosion was literally, you know, 200 feet in there. Right. Right. Like this.
[00:26:44] Well, you could say, oh, this was a 400 pounds worth of TNT. Yeah, you can't make those facts.
[00:26:49] You can't make those facts with it. But hey, something hits 50 meters from you and you never
[00:26:53] been ordered before. That will, that is a scary thing. Yeah. It's a scary thing. Do a metaphor, though.
[00:26:59] Yes. Yeah. But here's what's here's what's cool. Or here's what you need to, here's what I always
[00:27:04] need to remember. When I tell you, I got a mortar that landed 50 meters. Most people are like,
[00:27:09] damn, that's scary enough. I don't need to make it more scary. Oh, yeah. Let's just keep it real.
[00:27:15] Yeah. You even mentioned the smoke trail behind the mortar when you see it going up to me. That's scary.
[00:27:20] Yeah. I don't care how many meters. It's not really smoke. It's, uh, it's like little sparks.
[00:27:25] Like a sparkler. Oh, like a trail. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it sounds like too.
[00:27:29] It's something that even sounds scary by the way. So um, here we end up. We end up with SLA Marshall's
[00:27:36] buck. Lots to learn from it. And yeah. So let's get into it. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,
[00:27:42] we'll try and take it for what it's worth. Yes, sir. And I believe you're going to find as I was
[00:27:49] reviewing this buck. I'm like, yeah, there's so much good information in here. Here we go to the book.
[00:27:56] In the early years of World War II was the common practice of public spokesman in the United
[00:28:01] States to magnify the role of the machine in war while minimizing the importance of large forces of
[00:28:08] well-trained foot soldiers. Hey, World War II. We're just going to win this thing with all these
[00:28:13] big machines. We're, we're, we're creating once the total contest between national societies is
[00:28:21] predicated. It becomes impossible to write off the ultimate clash between the masses of men
[00:28:26] who fight on foot. They are the body of the national defense. There is no other way out.
[00:28:33] So the society, which looks for an easier way, is building its hope on sand.
[00:28:43] Do you already getting kind of fired up? Because that's real.
[00:28:49] Improvisation is the natural order of warfare. The perfect formulas will continue to be found only
[00:28:58] on charts. That's good. What's the quote that you clipped out of Dave Burke saying? Good deal.
[00:29:07] Yeah, good deal. Saying, you said it at the master. It's not a spreadsheet.
[00:29:13] Oh, yeah, this isn't a spreadsheet anymore. This isn't a spreadsheet anymore. And that's kind of
[00:29:16] what I, that maybe think of that because leadership is not a spreadsheet. It's not a spreadsheet. It's
[00:29:22] not a perfect thing that you can just put out in a spreadsheet. Okay, here's the decision. We're
[00:29:25] going to make it doesn't work that way. All right, here we go. Getting back to the book. Since
[00:29:30] more than a century ago, when the rifle bullet began its reign over the battlefield and soldiers
[00:29:35] slowly became aware that the day of close order formations in combat was forever gone,
[00:29:40] all military thinkers have pondered the need of a new discipline. It has been generally realized
[00:29:47] that fashioning the machine to man's use in battle was but half of the problem. The other half
[00:29:52] was conditioning man to the machine. The mechanisms of the new warfare do not set their own efficiency
[00:30:02] rate in battle. They are ever at the mercy of training methods, which will stimulate the soldier
[00:30:07] to express his intelligence and spirit. The philosophy of discipline has adjusted to changing
[00:30:14] conditions. So, think about this. Talk about discipline. The philosophy of discipline has adjusted
[00:30:19] to changing conditions. As more and more impact has gone into the hitting power of weapons,
[00:30:25] necessitating ever widening deployments of the forces of battle,
[00:30:31] keep the quality of the initiative in the individual has become the most praised of the military
[00:30:38] virtues. So, as we got these weapons that can shoot and kill more people at greater distances,
[00:30:43] people got more spread out. The more spread out, people got, the more it becomes important that you
[00:30:48] have initiative. Back to the book, it has been readily seen that the prevailing tactical
[00:30:54] conditions increase the problem of unit coherence in combat. This, the only offsets or people are
[00:31:01] more spread out, the only offset for this difficulty was to train for a higher degree of
[00:31:06] individual courage, comprehension of the situation and self-starting character in the soldier.
[00:31:12] So, the more spread out people get, the more you have to rely on these individual soldiers to make
[00:31:17] the right decisions out there, it's show initiative. That becomes the new discipline. This is
[00:31:22] decentralized command. By the way, from this realization, have come new concepts of discipline,
[00:31:30] which have altered nearly all the major aspects of life and of human association within Western
[00:31:36] armies. We have continued to grapple with the problem of how to free the mind of man,
[00:31:42] how to enlarge his appreciation of his personal worth as a unit in the battle, how to stimulate him
[00:31:49] to express his individual power within limits, which are good, which are for the good of all.
[00:31:58] How do we free the mind? How do we, and notice this is a little dichotomy here,
[00:32:03] free the mind to express the individual power, but here's the dichotomy within limits, which are
[00:32:09] for the good of all. So, you can't just be doing what's good for you, you can't just express your
[00:32:13] for your mind and do whatever you think is right for your own purpose, you need to do it for everyone,
[00:32:17] the good for all. Back to the book, it is universally recognized that as the means of war change
[00:32:24] so much the intelligence of man be quick and to keep pace with the changes. Our weakness lies in
[00:32:30] this that we have never got down to an exact definition of what we are seeking, failing that we fall
[00:32:37] short in our attempt to formulate in training how best to obtain it and our philosophy of discipline
[00:32:43] falters at the vital point of its practical tactical application. I say that it is a simple thing.
[00:32:51] What we need in battle is more and better fire. What we need to seek in training are any
[00:32:59] and all means by which we can increase the ratio of effective fire when we have to go to war.
[00:33:04] The discipline training methods and the personal policies of our forces should all be regulated
[00:33:08] to conform with this one fundamental need. Now, you can see what he's getting out here. This is
[00:33:14] his big statement. This is his big hypotheses. So, it's actually, he says, I say it's a simple
[00:33:20] thing. We need what we need in battle is more and better fire. That's his big statement. I don't
[00:33:26] agree with that. Like there's other things. There's a lot of other things going on in leadership.
[00:33:30] I think actually the things that he talked about prior to this are more important than fire.
[00:33:35] Descentralized commanded, making people take initiative and having people step up and do the right
[00:33:38] thing for the entire team. But with a free mind making these things happen. And for some reason,
[00:33:44] he just bypasses all that super important stuff. It says, hey, no, the most important thing. We need
[00:33:48] to be more and better fire. Fire is important. Hell, yes. Fire is important. That's why I love
[00:33:55] machine gunners. It's all my machine gunners out there. God bless you. You laid down the fire
[00:34:00] to all the supporting fire elements out there. Artillery, close air, love you. Thank you. We need
[00:34:07] more fire. I agree with that. But that's not, that's not the, it's not the thing that we narrow
[00:34:13] everything down to, which is his hypothesis. So, a lot of good information there. He narrows it down
[00:34:20] to a different direction. Don't agree with it. And actually I'll go ahead and say,
[00:34:24] not true. It's all these factors that we need to improve. Fire is not the sole thing. Fire is
[00:34:30] absolutely important. Fire wins fire fights. Absolutely fire maneuver. Cover, move wins fire
[00:34:38] fights. It helps. So, fire helps when fire fights doesn't win it on its own. Next chapter is called
[00:34:44] on future war. He says the battlefield is the epitome of war. All else in war, when war is perfectly
[00:34:52] conducted exists, but to serve the forces of the battlefield and to assure final success on the field.
[00:34:57] It is on the battlefield that the issues of war are decided. Check.
[00:35:05] Concure. It should be noted that all military power is dependent on civil will.
[00:35:14] It is the nation and not the army, which makes war. So, I've talked about that
[00:35:18] before the will. You gotta have the will. If you don't have the will as a nation,
[00:35:24] you're not going to win. And if talked about it before, the wills you're going to have to
[00:35:28] are the wills to the will to kill and the will to die because that's where war is. It's killing and
[00:35:33] die. And if you don't have those, if you don't have the will to do those two things, you should not be
[00:35:37] entering war. Because the outcome is not going to be good. Every improvement in weapon power is aimed at
[00:35:46] lessening the danger on one side by increasing it on the other. Consequently, every improvement in
[00:35:51] weapons is eventually met by a counter improvement. That's the jitsu, right? You get the counter.
[00:35:58] Come up for the new move. Guess what? Somebody's going to come up with a move to counter it.
[00:36:02] That's always happening with weapons. I like this little line right here. Decision in war is a
[00:36:09] clenching act. It is the action which finally delivers the victory surely into one's hands. Decision,
[00:36:16] decisiveness, making the call. That's what you need to do. Next chapter, man on the battlefield.
[00:36:28] On the battlefield, the real enemy is fear and not the bayonet or bullet. All means of union of
[00:36:34] power, demand, union of knowledge. That's a quote from Robert Jackson. And he continues here. It is
[00:36:41] of the battlefield that I speak in saying that the mind of the infantry soldier should be conditioned
[00:36:47] to an understanding of its reality through all stages of his training. And that's one of the reasons
[00:36:52] why I heard so many quotes about SLA Marshall is while we were getting trained, people would refer
[00:36:57] back to SLA Marshall. And when I ran training, I knew I had to bring it up sometimes because I
[00:37:03] 'd say, look, here's what's going on. We need to think about this. And I'll get to some of
[00:37:07] those points later. But training is methodology when he wrote this book, part of the focus is like,
[00:37:13] hey, we need to train people differently. And what he says about training is 100% valid, 100% valid.
[00:37:22] Back to the book, he needs to be taught the nature of the field as it is in war and as he may
[00:37:27] experience it someday. For if he does not acquire a soldier's view of the field, his image of it
[00:37:32] will be formed from the reading of novels or the romance written by war correspondence of which he was
[00:37:37] won by the way. Or from the viewing of or from viewing the battlefield as it is imagined to be by
[00:37:45] Hollywood. One of the purposes of training should be to remove these false ideas of battle from his mind.
[00:37:50] Totally agree. Absolutely. To give the soldier a correct concept of battle is a far different thing
[00:37:58] from encouraging him to think about war. So think about what I just said. To give the soldier
[00:38:04] a correct concept of battle is a far different thing from encouraging him to think about war.
[00:38:10] The latter is to vast the canvas. It includes too much detail which is confusing to his mind and
[00:38:15] immaterial to his personal problem. Here's like, don't think about this big picture. You need
[00:38:20] to think about what's happening. We have surpassed all other armies and outstripped common
[00:38:25] sense in our effort to teach man something about war. He's counted about war's causes, which is a
[00:38:30] good thing on which those rare occasions when he is when the instruction isn't qualified hands.
[00:38:34] He's told about how the soldiers and sailors of other nations observe, currency and foster
[00:38:39] tradition. He is even bored by lectures on the strategy and logistics of high command.
[00:38:44] But he does not get what he requires most. The simple details of common human experience on the
[00:38:50] field of battle. As a result, he goes to the supremely testing experience of his lifetime as it
[00:38:57] almost a total stranger. So you learn all the, you know what, actually when life took over the
[00:39:04] junior officer's course coming out of buds, it was very focused on the big picture stuff and it
[00:39:11] wasn't helping these guys being prepared to be in a seal putton. And life was like, no, I got to
[00:39:16] change this. You can still talk about this stuff and it's important to you don't throw it out.
[00:39:22] But you got to teach people what the human experience on the battlefield is and that's what
[00:39:28] life tried to do and that's what I try to do and I took over training and my training was further
[00:39:31] along when I took it over, you know, we already moved in that direction or it already reflected that.
[00:39:38] But a lot of the stuff that life was being taught in life's course was not
[00:39:42] the human experience on the field of battle. Life tried to get that in there and he did a good
[00:39:48] job of it. Back to the book, the price for failure. So the, so you're talking about to train these
[00:39:53] people correctly. The price for failure is paid all up and down the line. Men going to action
[00:39:59] the first time, haltingly and gropingly as if they were lost at night in the deep woods,
[00:40:05] lives are wasted unnecessarily. Time is lost. Ground that might be taken is overlooked.
[00:40:10] It is not necessary that these misfortunes before organizations simply because they are new to
[00:40:16] battle. It is possible that the infantry soldier can be trained to anticipate fully the true
[00:40:21] conditions of the battlefield. It is possible that units can be schooled to take full and prompt
[00:40:26] action against this, against the disunifying effect of these conditions. Fear is ever presence.
[00:40:32] But the, but it is the uncontrolled fear that is the enemy of successful operation and the control
[00:40:37] of fear depends upon the extent to which all dangers and distractions may be correctly anticipated
[00:40:43] and therefore understood. You got to simulate battle. That's what you got to do. And they did a great
[00:40:49] job when I was going through my workups. They did a great job of doing that. When I took over
[00:40:52] and was running training, we brought it even to the next level. It was freaking mayhem out there.
[00:40:57] And I had many people. And we're going to have some guys that are retiring in the future
[00:41:01] that are coming on the podcast that went through my workups. They will tell you being an actual
[00:41:06] cop. That was easier. There was easier. And that's what my goal was. We want this training to be
[00:41:12] so chaotic. And what you think about this right here. And you think about law enforcement training.
[00:41:17] Should be the same way. You want these guys completely tested. You want it to be harder than
[00:41:21] anybody they ever have to deal with. You want the situation to be more stressful than they're
[00:41:24] going to deal with in real life. And that's how you get them prepared. Next, the heart of the
[00:41:30] matter is to relate to man is to relate the man to his fellow soldier as he will find him on
[00:41:37] the field of combat to condition him to human nature. As he will learn to depend on it when the
[00:41:44] ground offers him no comfort and weapons fail. He talks a lot about human nature. I talk a lot about
[00:41:50] human nature. When you were when you'd hear about this, oh, this guy or the man this one,
[00:41:58] did you know that he was a faker back then? It was yes. But it was, you know, there's two sides to
[00:42:07] every story. It seemed like to me until I read about face. And I was like, okay, there's the actual
[00:42:13] side. There's the actual side. Because, you know, Hackworth said, look, this is what he actually did.
[00:42:18] Here's his military records. So, but up until I read about face, it was kind of like, oh,
[00:42:22] that's, oh, there's some weird stuff about his career. But you know, yeah, kind of what is a gray area?
[00:42:31] But not everyone. Some people would talk about him like he was the man without any
[00:42:36] demarits against him, without any question against him. Right. Which kind of adds to the little
[00:42:41] hodgepodge opinions? Yeah. That was a crazy thing. I mean, when Hackworth was just talking
[00:42:47] about opening that I read, this is something that is just what you read it, you go, oh, God. So,
[00:42:52] he's saying that, Hackworth is saying that basically he, he, he didn't want to bring up the fact.
[00:43:01] He stayed on his good side. Right. Hey, he, value his career. Slam had a lot of power. So,
[00:43:07] he's just going to stay on his good side. And then he's saying how many other guys were doing that.
[00:43:12] How many guys were just staying on SLA Marshall's good side because they wanted to continue their
[00:43:18] career and in order to do that, they're like, oh, you know, I'm not going to say anything about it.
[00:43:22] Yeah. And that actually bolsters his power because Hackworth at this time,
[00:43:26] right, if you get a blessing from Hackworth, it's like, that's real problem. Remember what,
[00:43:31] remember what, Mook, Jim Mook, Yama said about Hackworth? He's like, everybody knew Hackworth.
[00:43:35] Everybody knew him. He was Mr. Infantry. Coolest nickname ever about it, right?
[00:43:40] Yeah. Sure. If I come back in another world, I'm going to do whatever it takes to earn the
[00:43:45] nickname Mr. Infantry. That's just as legit as it gets. So, but when you got Hackworth going, oh,
[00:43:53] yep, yeah, I work with Slam. Good guy. Right. That's a little, oh, that's Hackworth saying that. So,
[00:43:58] it's, it's like, and now there's other generals are saying this because everybody just wants to
[00:44:02] protect a little career. I mean, he's saying he was opportunistic. And this is Hackworth coming out,
[00:44:06] straight up calling himself guilty. Yeah. So, do you think this happens all the time though, right?
[00:44:12] That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's all the time. So, do you think that it's kind of in a way you're
[00:44:16] duty to kind of to call it out? Okay. There's two ways to answer that question. If you call it out,
[00:44:24] and it doesn't work, and you get blacklisted by SLA Marshall. And now you don't make rank,
[00:44:29] and now you're not in charge, and they shove you off to some billet over and wherever.
[00:44:33] Mm-hmm. And now you have no more influence. Did you do a good job?
[00:44:38] Did you make a right call? If you play the game and you just go along with it,
[00:44:43] and you try and get yourself to a position of power where you can actually have more influence,
[00:44:47] and you would have had, and you had to, you had to bite your tongue. Was that the good move?
[00:44:53] But what if you didn't really get to where you wanted to be, and now you accelerated him, and he
[00:44:57] turned to get, you know, I mean, that's, that's a very tough decision to make, and that's why
[00:45:00] that's why you gotta be, that's why you gotta be tactfully, you gotta think about what's going on.
[00:45:04] You gotta think about the long-term consequences of what you're about to do. That's why leadership
[00:45:07] is challenging. And that's why playing these little political games, which you have to play in every
[00:45:11] different organization. People don't think there's political games in the military golf. It's a big political
[00:45:15] game. It's a big giant political game. And same thing in companies corporations. That's the way
[00:45:21] the world works. You gotta play the game. Yeah. So like even socially, you know, where,
[00:45:27] let's say you know a person, and I've been in the situation before, not even necessarily in it.
[00:45:32] I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that either, but I'm saying plausible denying,
[00:45:36] no, and just came out. They're job-etcrolls. But you know, you know, if somebody who,
[00:45:42] there, they're like a complete like faker, dire, and you know, they, they got an orange,
[00:45:48] you know, just some same, you know, social scenario where, you know, they have a nice car,
[00:45:52] but then they owe like 10 people, like 10s of thousands of dollars because how they screw them over
[00:45:58] in something like their friends and all this stuff, right? Yeah. Meanwhile, there's a small group of
[00:46:03] people who know all about that stuff. And we see, you know, we'll see, or you'll see this person
[00:46:07] as this huge faker going around town as this huge faker. But everyone else who's not in it sees
[00:46:13] them as this great person who's like, you know, whatever. Is it your duty on a social level,
[00:46:21] same same? Like, to be like, hey, because, you know, I guess it could be said like, hey,
[00:46:26] you're kind of protecting other people from getting screwed in that same way. Yeah, for sure.
[00:46:31] But at the same time, it's like, yeah, do you, especially if you don't have a dog in the faker?
[00:46:35] Actually, look at what, what is this person doing? That's benefiting anyone. If all
[00:46:39] they're doing a screw in people over, I'm going to say something for sure. If this person,
[00:46:43] if this individual is somehow, you know, running a big charity organization, right? Right? Like,
[00:46:50] that's a legit thing, right? That could happen. He's donate money or getting people to donate or
[00:46:54] whatever. Maybe I'd try and mitigate it more. But, you know, in a social situation, just first
[00:47:02] and just sounds like they're going to screw people over. I think I'm going to, I think I'm going
[00:47:05] to drop time. Yeah. Yeah. On one hand, you're kind of like, yeah, let me, let me, and not the kind
[00:47:11] you're not going to go on the radio or something and broadcast it. Well, you don't have to go on the
[00:47:16] radio or these, right? You don't know, you can go on the social media. No, that's what it mean. But
[00:47:20] you're not going to go on and announce these things. It's just like, if it ever comes up. Here's,
[00:47:25] you know, here's a situation that could unfold. If you call this person out, now that no,
[00:47:31] now they stop whatever form of income they have, now no one that they always money to is actually
[00:47:35] going to ever get paid back. Right? Isn't that to be problematic? Yeah. Or you now you have like
[00:47:39] a little conflict with this person. Now you got to deal with whatever comes of that. Yeah.
[00:47:44] Same thing. It's kind of like, don't like what you call, you need, you know, money, the
[00:47:49] waters or whatever. Like don't disturb the waters kind of thing. Yeah. And then hopefully,
[00:47:53] which usually actually is the case in such an social situation where they're going to play
[00:47:58] themselves anyway. So that's true. And that gets out. You can't like, but I don't like people
[00:48:04] taking people's money. Yeah. So I'm going to have a problem with this person. Yeah. That's the bottom
[00:48:08] line. Yeah. Fully. And I think most people that's how it is, you know, they're like that's all.
[00:48:13] And I think the weird thing is social people that don't, they don't, they don't, they don't
[00:48:16] be coming around me if they, I kind of give off the vibe of like, hey, you don't want to be
[00:48:21] acting that way around me. Yeah. So I don't have a lot of people like that hanging around. Yeah.
[00:48:27] There it is. Going back to the book. Only when human, rather than material aspects of
[00:48:35] operation are put up or most, can tactical bodies be conditioned to make the most of their potential
[00:48:40] unity. So the human being, he's saying that human beings are more important. It is beyond question
[00:48:47] that the most serious and repeated breakdowns on the field of combat are caused by failure of controls
[00:48:55] over human nature. I'm going to read that again. It is beyond question that the most serious and
[00:49:02] repeated breakdowns on the field of combat are caused by failure of the controls over human nature,
[00:49:08] not tactics, not weapons, not machinery, not physical strengths, but human nature.
[00:49:16] And guess what, I agree with that. I agree with that. We all grant that the soldier must be trained
[00:49:24] for initiative and encourage to think about what is problem while in combat. So again, he talks about
[00:49:32] a lot about initiative and that's one of the things that I think was very positive.
[00:49:37] That's one of the things that influenced me knowing that it was important for people to have
[00:49:43] initiative and knowing that you can't control whatever you want on the battlefield and
[00:49:45] understanding decentralized command. Back to the book, our training methods are conditioned by the
[00:49:49] ideal of automatic response. So he's saying like we think that the best thing, the best ideal
[00:49:56] is just automatic response. That's what we want. At the same time, our observation of the battle
[00:50:01] fields reality makes it clear to us that we need men who can think through their situation and steal
[00:50:08] themselves for action according to the situation. So we don't want automatic response. We want
[00:50:14] people that can think. The thinking soldier, the man who's trained for self-starting, cannot be matured
[00:50:20] in a school which holds to the vestiges of the belief that automatic action is the ideal thing
[00:50:27] in the soldier. Again, this is undeniable, undeniable. We want people that are think for themselves.
[00:50:40] I hold it to be one of the simplest truths of war that the thing which enables an infantry soldier
[00:50:45] to keep going with his weapons is the near presence or the presumed presence of a combat.
[00:50:50] It happened too frequently in our army that a line company was careless about the manner in which
[00:50:58] it was received a new replacement. The stranger was not introduced to his superiors,
[00:51:03] nor was there time for him to feel the friendly interest of his immediate associates before
[00:51:08] he was ordered forward with the attack. The result was the man's total failure in battle and
[00:51:13] has returned to the rear as a mental case. So it is far more than a question of the soldier's
[00:51:20] need of physical support from other men. He must have at least some feeling of spiritual unity
[00:51:26] with them if he is to do an efficient job of moving and fighting. This is very important. I work
[00:51:32] with companies all the time. So you take a army unit and you throw a random guy in there, a random
[00:51:39] replacement and no one meets him and no one talks to him and also they're going on and attack. He's
[00:51:43] going to fail. That's the statement because he doesn't under he doesn't know anyone else and he
[00:51:47] goes more into detail in the in the book. But that happens with companies where they have some
[00:51:52] new new person check on board they get hired they check on board, no one meets him, no one greets him,
[00:51:57] no one becomes friends with them, they're in their own isolated little world, the pressure starts to
[00:52:01] come and they bail or they break. He talks more about this in chapter four which is called combat
[00:52:08] isolation and there's a quote that it starts off from major general Charles W. O. Daniel and it says,
[00:52:13] the finest theories in most my new plans often crumble. Complex systems fall by the wayside
[00:52:24] parade ground formations disappear are splendidly trained leaders vanish. The good men which we
[00:52:33] had at the beginning are gone. The raw truth is before us. That's good. Yeah and obviously
[00:52:46] law of combat number two keep things simple. That's exactly what he's talking about. You got to keep
[00:52:51] things simple but he's also saying that everything that you come up with these complex things they're
[00:52:56] going to fall apart and combat. That's what happens. And now we talk about the name of the
[00:53:02] chapters combat isolation and he starts talking about what it's like when these soldiers get on the
[00:53:09] battlefield he's talking about the battlefield's cold and it's harsh and it's empty and there's it's
[00:53:16] chills a man's soul is what he's saying and then when the fire starts here we go back to the
[00:53:22] book he finds himself suddenly almost alone in his hour of greatest danger and he can feel the
[00:53:27] danger but there is nothing out there, nothing to contend against. It is from the mixture of
[00:53:33] mystification and fear that there comes the feeling of helplessness which in turn produces greater fear.
[00:53:41] That is what green troops are up against. Time and again I have heard them say after their first
[00:53:46] triacombat by God there was never a situation like it. We saw no one we were fighting phantoms
[00:53:52] and as frequently they have and as frequently they have added this though their convictions about
[00:53:59] the matter were holy at odds with the fact of the situation we had to do it all alone we got no
[00:54:05] support on either flank. So he's talking about the fact that we you feel alone on the battlefield
[00:54:12] and the fact that guys would come back and say even though they were fully supported it didn't matter
[00:54:19] they thought they were alone out there and that's what he's talking about he goes on. The enemy
[00:54:25] now he's talking about fire fights situation the enemy fire builds up it's aim becomes true
[00:54:30] or the man spread the men spread further and further from each other moving individually to whatever
[00:54:35] cover is nearest or forwards the best protection a few of them fire their pieces at first they do so
[00:54:42] almost timidly as if fearing a rebuk for wasting ammunition when they do not see the enemy.
[00:54:47] Others do nothing some fail to act mainly because they are puzzled what to do and their leaders do
[00:54:52] not tell them. Others are wholly unnerved and can either think nor move in sensible relation to
[00:54:58] the situation such response as the men make of two enemy fire tends mainly to produce greater
[00:55:04] separation in the elements of the company thereby intensifying the in-tenceifying the feeling
[00:55:09] of isolation and the insecurity of its individuals. The junior leaders are affected as much as
[00:55:16] the rifle files. So when chaos starts people start to be alone again this can apply the battlefield
[00:55:26] this can apply the business world when chaos starts people start to focus on their own little
[00:55:30] world and the more you focus on your own little world the more separation there is the less
[00:55:36] unity there is in your unit to make something happen now he goes on back to the book could one
[00:55:41] clear commanding voice be raised even though it be the voice of an individual without
[00:55:47] titular authority they would obey or at least the stronger characters would do would do so
[00:55:54] and the weaker would begin to take heart because something is being done. I got to see this over
[00:56:03] when I was running training I got to see this over and over and over and over again as my
[00:56:07] fact we lay for chapter about it in the decademy leadership of situations where one situation
[00:56:14] particular where there's no voice no one's taking charge finally someone steps up and take
[00:56:20] charge and it's like boom everything changes but clear commanding voices are all too rare on the
[00:56:26] battle on the field of battle so they wait doing nothing and in action takes further toll on their
[00:56:33] resolve more grievous losses will no doubt come to this band of men in time but as a company this is
[00:56:40] the worst hour that they will ever know so it's a downward spiral if no one steps up and starts
[00:56:45] making calls you start taking casualties now if people panic even more they get more in their own
[00:56:49] little world they become more detached from each other less unity of what you're trying to make happen
[00:56:56] back to the book it would serve no purpose to dwell on the discouraging detail of this or
[00:57:00] deal if it were not for the belief that much of it is unnecessary and that the infantry soldier can
[00:57:06] find a better way one must not come to rest on class vets gloomy warning that quote in war the novice
[00:57:17] is met only by pitch black knight on beyond that there are words to be read it is of the first
[00:57:27] importance that the soldier higher low should not have to encounter in war things which seem for the
[00:57:34] first time set him in terror or perplexity so that's calls for it's talking about training you
[00:57:41] got to get people ready for this chaos and mayhem you've got to get it get them ready for it you've
[00:57:45] got to get them ready you got to show them that when people panic and people are getting separated
[00:57:50] that one commanding voice one leader stepping up and leading will have a massive impact on the
[00:57:55] situation and failure to do that will also have a massive but the impact but it will be a massive negative
[00:58:00] impact now he talks chapter five is called ratio of fire and here we get into his little hypothesis
[00:58:12] I'm not going to waste a lot of time out of it but I'm going to bring it up back to the book now
[00:58:16] I do not think I've seen it stated in the military manuals of this age or in any of the writing
[00:58:21] 's meant for the instruction of those who lead troops that a commander of infantry will be well
[00:58:26] advised to believe that when he engages the enemy not more than one quarter of his men will
[00:58:31] ever strike a real blow unless they are compelled by almost overpowering circumstances or unless
[00:58:38] all junior leaders constantly ride herd on troops with specific mission of increasing their fire
[00:58:44] the 25% estimate stands for even for well trained and campaign season troops I mean that 75%
[00:58:55] will not fire or will not persist in firing against the enemy and his works
[00:59:00] these men may face danger but will not fight so that's his hypothesis and actually the beginning
[00:59:07] of this book has a forward in it that I'm just going to touch on the forwards written by a guy named
[00:59:12] Russell Glenn and he he points out some of the disputes against this about this low ratio of fire
[00:59:23] so here we go back to the book this is the introduction so this isn't SLA Marshall this is from the
[00:59:28] introduction from Russell Glenn Marshall's ratio of fire values did not go unchallenged even when they
[00:59:34] first appeared in 1947 general James and Gavin World War II commander of the 82nd airborne division
[00:59:42] discounted the low estimates as did Harry W.O. Kennard who served in the 101st airborne division
[00:59:49] in every one of its combat actions during World War II and later commanded the first cavalry
[00:59:54] division in Vietnam legendary general Bruce Clark commander of the US forces that defended St. Viff
[01:00:01] during the battle of the bulge flatly discounted Marshall finding his values ridiculous and dangerous
[01:00:09] assertions absolute nonsense another combat veteran british author George McDonald Fraser
[01:00:18] instead question Marshall's explanation for why soldiers failed to engage the enemy
[01:00:24] Fraser had served so one of the things that Marshall says is that people aren't are taught not to
[01:00:33] kill and you know it's against the commandments of God and it's bad to kill and so that's one of the
[01:00:39] things we have a moral and inherent moral objection to killing and so so this guy Donald Fraser
[01:00:47] Fraser had served in Burma as an infantryman though he recognized that moral upbringing might influence
[01:00:53] men's behavior his first-hand experience failed to support Marshall's rationale Fraser wrote that
[01:00:59] we all have kindly impulses fostered by 2,000 years of Christian teaching gentle Jesus and love
[01:01:06] thy neighbor but we have the killer instinct too the murderous impulse of the hunter
[01:01:14] and so the introduction of the book goes on and talks about many vets that just outright deny this
[01:01:21] and I do too and I never saw I never saw or felt any hesitation or saw anyone that I was with
[01:01:33] hesitate in any way to engage in fact quite the opposite most guys were more than ready to get after it
[01:01:41] and I'm not just talking about seals I'm talking about army infantrymen I'm talking about marines
[01:01:45] the guys are guys are not hesitating I mean broadly you could never make a statement like this
[01:01:54] could you make a statement that some people hesitate yes you could make that statement but to
[01:01:58] broadly say that only 15 to 25% of people are going to actively engage the enemy from everything I saw
[01:02:05] that's patently untrue now the advantage and what we had for an advantage and
[01:02:13] martial kind of claims this too is that once World War II is over and they started training us
[01:02:20] to shoot at one of the big objections it has that that guys were getting trained to shoot bulls
[01:02:25] eye targets right so that your training is shoot a bulls eye when you first see a man you're like oh no
[01:02:29] that's a man we my whole career I'd barely ever shot a bulls eye target we did that when we had to
[01:02:38] qualify with a rifle or pistol every single other time we shot we were shooting a man shaped target
[01:02:44] I mean we would shoot little round targets what were they called head plates right we're shooting at
[01:02:49] heads we're shooting body shots we're shooting that's what we do all the time and we shoot
[01:02:55] so we shoot targets with pictures on them with faces on them that look like people and then on top
[01:03:00] of that we did force on force training where we're actually shooting paint balls or semi-unition
[01:03:05] at other human beings and we're gunning them down so there's a lot of conditioning that we had that
[01:03:12] maybe that's why we were so much more apt and able and willing to shoot but yeah it's from you know
[01:03:25] you can see from what these other vets said and these other leaders said and my personal experience
[01:03:30] and you'll find that I think SLA martial like I said I think you just had a hypothesis you
[01:03:36] wanted to talk about and threw it out there without really good facts behind it so I'm not going
[01:03:42] to waste a bunch of time talking about that and I'm going to go into the next chapter fire is the cure
[01:03:54] finally it is the volume of fire that counts you win if you kill more of the enemy than
[01:03:59] he can kill a view if you cannot you're defeated that's secretary of war robber p pattern and again
[01:04:05] I'll go back to this fire counts for sure it's important but you got him maneuver it's covered
[01:04:10] move it's not just covering fire it's like you got to cover and move that's that's to me
[01:04:15] they go hand in hand which actually he says back the book fundamentally fire must always be beaten
[01:04:23] by fire fundamentally movement is the means of increasing the efficiency of ones own fire until
[01:04:28] the last strength of the enemy's fire is reduced to a vanish point okay I mean okay if you want to say
[01:04:34] that you're maneuvering so that you can maneuver so you can fire even better that's that's technically
[01:04:39] true or your maneuvering so you can break contact but you could say that here's another quote
[01:04:48] let us not think of mobility in an army general Charles P. Summer all once said unless we think
[01:04:55] of mobility accompanied by violence that's cover move that's fire maneuver that's what we're talking
[01:05:02] about combat can cannot ever approximate the conditions of field maneuvers fears of varying
[01:05:14] sort of afflict the soldier in battle the unit commander soon comes to realize that one of his
[01:05:20] difficulties is to get men to leave cover because of enemy bullets and the fear they instill in training
[01:05:28] they're being no real bullet danger even on the courses which employ live ammunition every
[01:05:34] advance under a supposed enemy fire is unrealistic two in training the soldier does not have a man
[01:05:41] as his target he is not shooting with the idea of killing there is a third vast difference in the
[01:05:46] two conditions the riflemen in training is usually under close observation and the chief pressure
[01:05:52] upon him is to give satisfaction to his superior whereas the riflemen engaging the enemy is
[01:05:57] of necessity pretty much on his own and the chief pressure on him is to remain alive if possible
[01:06:04] when the infantry men mind when the infantry men's mind is gripped by fear his body is captured
[01:06:10] by inertia which is fears semi-situin in an attack half of the men on a firing line are in terror
[01:06:19] and the other half are unnerved so wrote major general jfc fuller when he was a young captain so
[01:06:27] again this is what i kind of already talked about the idea that in training you're shooting at
[01:06:31] you're not shooting with this intent to kill and we that's what we did all the time I mean
[01:06:35] that's just how we rolled if actually they make targets were like blood comes out we shoot and
[01:06:39] balloon blows up and black you see blood so they're trying to condition you and they talk about
[01:06:43] this with video games too right that these young kids come up killing all the time in these video
[01:06:48] games which are very very realistic and therefore they get conditioned to killing and they
[01:06:54] don't think it's a big deal anymore which clearly that you could tie that into
[01:06:59] school shootings a lot of people tie that into school shootings and say hey these kids were
[01:07:03] playing these video games where there's killing people all the time and that condition them
[01:07:07] to be able to kill these innocent people in a school so there is like I said for me all I ever
[01:07:14] shot at basically was human targets things that look like people and again I've seen the video games
[01:07:22] that they are so realistic it's unbelievable and so that's another good form of conditioning
[01:07:28] to get you over the if you have any moral objection to killing now the the counter statement to that
[01:07:35] is good for people to get over the moral condition of killing some people no if you're not a soldier
[01:07:42] that's probably a bad thing I would say yeah yeah even the video game thing it seems like there's
[01:07:48] like a step before that to for someone to get conditioned to killing because I don't know obviously
[01:07:56] might in less intense video game experiences like PlayStation 2 which seems like a long time ago but
[01:08:06] so yeah the video games are realistic but it seems like that they they have to get past a certain
[01:08:11] step to consider the video games as being training so you guys like when you guys were you know
[01:08:17] and see training you know in the seal team you guys are specifically training for that specific thing
[01:08:22] that was on your mind so you're past the point of the moral objection part of it seems
[01:08:27] saying so let's say you weren't past the moral objection part of it and you were just
[01:08:31] shooting what if you'd be video games or shooting at the range or shooting at these other
[01:08:34] things and you were like hey I know this is I'm not training for anything specifically I'm just
[01:08:38] sort of doing it whether it be for fun or to get better at shooting or better at this game or whatever
[01:08:43] if you're not past the moral objection part is it really training you to be less more morally
[01:08:50] well let's say if you're a kid that's like got some major issues and you're thinking about
[01:08:55] doing a school shooting and then you're sitting there playing these video games and you're
[01:08:59] killing people over and over again it's conditioning yeah yeah that's what I mean you put
[01:09:04] anyone in a you know you get someone that works in a slaughterhouse they don't think twice about
[01:09:09] killing a pig or killing a cow or whatever that's what they do they don't think a millisecond
[01:09:13] about it whereas you take someone that's never seen an animal killed before and it'll be
[01:09:17] disturbing to them so that right there is that they're conditioning is a thing right and if you
[01:09:23] watch a bunch of you know a bunch of videos of something being killed you'd become conditioned to it
[01:09:30] and if you play a game where you kill people all the time you will become conditioned to it
[01:09:35] now I don't think this is even debatable yeah but I feel yeah I agree but I feel like there's this
[01:09:40] one kind of crucial step before that like you'd consider a slaughterhouse person like there's a
[01:09:45] difference between working in a slaughterhouse and being conditioned to the sight and the smell
[01:09:49] and the experience of doing it but not having the barrier that's like okay I'm gonna make a
[01:09:56] decision to do this under you know a different circumstance something that's more more
[01:10:01] morally tied well yeah I mean in let's face the factors millions and I'm others 100
[01:10:06] of millions of people that play video games all day long and they're not going out there and
[01:10:11] I have no intention of going out there but okay so yeah I see what you're saying if you start thinking
[01:10:16] that way and that becomes your intent then it is conditioning because you can even consider someone
[01:10:21] on the opposite where let's say they're morally what do you call them moral barrier has been
[01:10:27] crossed in their head or they're weird they're psychopath I don't know you know and they're brain
[01:10:31] and then they've never killed anyone or anything like that so I heard it actually read this thing
[01:10:37] on Saddam Hussein's son son's devil and so the first time how they'd quote him quote
[01:10:44] condition them they'd be like hey you know here's some prisoners shoot him kill him right so the
[01:10:49] first time now the first time not can these kids not conditioned in this way to you know to have
[01:10:55] the experience of killing somebody and watch them die and whatever so the first time they
[01:10:59] give them the gun they got you the kids shoots and what empties the clip right the kid was
[01:11:05] passed them that moral barrier long time ago but first time unconditioned as far as the experience
[01:11:10] goes he turns to the guard and goes hey can I have another magazine to do it so he really liked it
[01:11:17] he didn't need necessarily conditioning because he was passed that more apart so him saying yeah
[01:11:21] so yeah it feels like they are they are two separate things but once you kind of cross that
[01:11:25] that initial moral barrier oh yeah the more conditioned you are the you know the more
[01:11:30] effect I mean I hate these were the effect but more into it you are or the less impact it'll have
[01:11:37] like on your brain or whatever yeah and again we would get this is one of the things we get
[01:11:42] quoted on SLA Marshall was this stuff about how as the targets got more realistic it encouraged
[01:11:49] people and made them more comfortable with shooting and killing that's the point um
[01:11:54] then I believe yeah that's true it's true so it is going back to the book as another
[01:12:03] experiment unwilling riflemen may have maybe switched to heavier and more decisive one man
[01:12:09] weapons this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to come from increased
[01:12:16] responsibility this is good so he said you got a rifleman that doesn't want to shoot give him a
[01:12:21] bigger more effective weapon he says this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to
[01:12:30] come from increased responsibility but it works I've seen many cases were men who had
[01:12:36] funked it badly with a rifle responded heroically when given a flame thrower or a bar
[01:12:43] self-pried and the ego are the touchstone of most these remarkable conversions a man may fail
[01:12:49] with the rifle because he feels anonymous and believes it nothing important is being asked of him
[01:12:55] so that's pretty cool because I talk about this all the time why could the earth because everyone
[01:12:58] has a rifle and he's like okay let's not really but I'm not really that important yeah
[01:13:02] then you give him like a heavy weapon or heavy machine gun or a flame thrower and also he's like
[01:13:07] oh yeah I'm the man I'm going to step up and make this happen which if I've talked about this many
[01:13:11] times on the podcast you get someone that's not doing their job or they need to do a better job
[01:13:16] or what have you if you can give them more responsibility they have a good chance of actually
[01:13:21] stepping up and making things happen root off the red nose reindeer not familiar with the
[01:13:26] what yeah don't have familiar with root off the red nose yeah okay so root off was the only one
[01:13:31] with the red nose and before they were like they used to tease him and all this stuff you know
[01:13:36] so he's he thought he was inferior but when Santa was like hey your nose is so bright
[01:13:42] won't you guide my slate or tonight I get to guide the slay hell yeah steps up does the job there you
[01:13:47] don't see check yeah see you get it that out if you want to no reds the same thing conceptually
[01:13:54] conceptually all right next back to the book and last if we are to strengthen sound training principles
[01:14:03] and establish mental attitudes which are essential to the understanding of the decisive
[01:14:07] importance of fire in tactics we will be well advised to cease talking about fire and movement
[01:14:15] as if the latter were separate and apart from the former in tactical fact there and there did
[01:14:23] not exist an automatic and unbreakable connection between them so now he's saying the same thing
[01:14:29] that I was saying earlier is fire is not more important they're the same thing fire maneuver
[01:14:34] cover move half to happen together that's what he's saying fire is the key to mobility
[01:14:41] to fire is to move so he goes on now this next section again this is great because
[01:14:49] next section is called the multiples of information the multiples of information and what's great
[01:14:55] about this is he's no longer talking about he's no longer talking about tactics of fire maneuver
[01:15:00] and this percentage of fire and all that because he's out of his element there to be quite honest
[01:15:05] with you this one he's going to get into his element which is well I'll go to it
[01:15:13] I consider to be of utmost importance the keeping informed of our man as to current situation
[01:15:18] so that each man may perform his duty with understanding of its importance and that's sergeant
[01:15:24] David T. Bolt in a letter written from the African theater so you gotta keep your people informed
[01:15:33] having started to call this chapter communications I decided against it for fear
[01:15:39] that use of that rather formidable word might interfere with my communicating to the reader
[01:15:44] what I regard as a vital but frequently overlooked principle of minor tactics if a word
[01:15:51] comes to mean too many things it frequently misses fire at the critical point that has been the
[01:15:56] fate of the word communications it has become another military catch all and because it means so many
[01:16:03] things it is quite frequently means nothing to illustrate a regimental commander asks a company
[01:16:11] commander how are your communications and the latter replies excellent because his telephone line
[01:16:16] is working and his supply is coming forward and at the same time he is at the point of despair
[01:16:23] because he hasn't had anything worthwhile any worthwhile intelligence from his flanks for hours
[01:16:30] so there's a difference between communication like I can talk to you and actual communication
[01:16:34] you're telling you what I need to know one would think that it would become almost second
[01:16:40] nature to the commander to reach eagerly toward supporting forces one would imagine that whenever
[01:16:46] on the field of battle he made contact with a friendly element that fact would flash a red light
[01:16:50] in his brain causing him automatically to raise the question have I established full communications
[01:16:56] do I know the strength and intentions of the force now helping me do they know my strength and
[01:17:00] intentions but indeed such is not the case communications
[01:17:07] information is the soul of morale and combat and the balancing force in successful tactics
[01:17:19] and now he talks a little bit about communication he gives some guidelines about him
[01:17:24] and what the problems are so information is super important here's some of the problems one
[01:17:28] there is a lacking there is lacking a general recognition of the supreme importance of the lateral
[01:17:36] flow of information two command at the lower levels is too often neglectful of the principle
[01:17:43] that it is not a channel of information only but a distribution point so you got to pass the word
[01:17:50] three commanders at the lower levels tend to be arbitrary judges of what information deriving from a
[01:17:56] source lower would be highly useful to the other elements lowered down instead of a biting
[01:18:01] by the rule went and out pass it along so went and out pass along now I do have to throw out
[01:18:10] that there can be a dichotter there's a dichotter because you can communicate things too much
[01:18:14] you can send too many emails you can send too many messages you can do that that can be a problem
[01:18:20] and he actually talks about that dichotter me a little bit so he's just talked about how much
[01:18:24] you should communicate and then he gets to this point back to the book in the Pacific flighting
[01:18:28] I found company commanders joining a platoon in the line just to isolate themselves from their
[01:18:33] telephones they were literally tired to death of having the battalion commander insist on having a
[01:18:39] fresh progress report every 15 or 20 minutes and the battalion commander poor devil was only
[01:18:45] passing on the pressure which he had in turn received from a regimental commander who is trying to
[01:18:50] playkate division yet one would observe that unless a battalion commander is wholly lacking in judgment
[01:18:58] or intestinal fortitude he should be strong enough to take this on his aching back and not pass it
[01:19:04] down to the headquarters which is at grips with the enemy this happens all the time in the military
[01:19:11] for sure the senior commanders going I want to know what's going on and tell us that to the next
[01:19:16] junior guys is alright I'm all find out what's going on and that guy says I'll find out what's going on
[01:19:21] and the people in the front line they can't even fight because they're too busy trying to answer
[01:19:25] the damn questions from up the chain of command so don't let that happen back to the book in the
[01:19:31] burden island fight during the invasion of the marshals one of these prodding demands for more
[01:19:37] progress raised from division right through lower headquarters to a platoon which had been stopped
[01:19:42] cold by japfire coming from spider holes arranged in great depth along the beach the lieutenant
[01:19:49] got the message and crawling forward to the his most advanced riflemen told him to get up and go on
[01:19:56] the boy screamed so the whole goddamn army wants me to want to kill me does it okay lieutenant
[01:20:02] here I go but watch what happens he was shot dead almost before he had gotten out of his tracks
[01:20:09] that incident seared deep into the brain of every man who witnessed it it was final judgment on
[01:20:16] the futility of that kind of leading decentralized command who's going to make a better call somebody
[01:20:23] back in the rear or this lieutenant that's there on the beach back to the book the all two frequent
[01:20:32] consequences of such pressure are lying exaggeration and distortion of the situation at lower
[01:20:38] levels resulting in a false concept of the situation at the higher the average company commander can
[01:20:44] stand only a limited amount of this heat and then he will knock over a couple of outhouses
[01:20:49] and report that he has captured a village. It also this effect also makes a wishful thinker of the
[01:20:58] most objective shoulder he reads he reads into himself I'll have that position in another hour
[01:21:04] so I'll tell him that I have it now and get them off my back so lots about communication being
[01:21:15] important next is the riddle of command many headquarters people become strangers to the front
[01:21:22] and cannot speak its language or understand its tribulations okay the you don't know what's going
[01:21:27] on the front lines if you don't have any idea if you can't even speak their language anymore you
[01:21:30] need to get down there you need to find out what's going on on the front lines businesses that
[01:21:34] means you too the diabolical effect of even such a relatively simple instrument as the field
[01:21:43] telephone is that it may come to command the commander the phone actually gets control of you it
[01:21:52] chains into a system of remote control at first he sees it only as a successful as a useful
[01:21:57] channel for quick communication and combat then he fears to leave it less it should require his
[01:22:02] presence in headquarters the moment after he leaves to go forward this state of mind in turn creates
[01:22:10] its own illusion fostering that fostering the conclusion that under the new system of war all
[01:22:16] matters can be settled at a distance all problems arising within the zone of fire can be fully
[01:22:22] understood without ever going there and all moral values which once attended the commander
[01:22:27] effort to impress his men with his personality and character are somehow sundered by the new technology
[01:22:34] of operations out of sedentary general ship arises evil of troops which while obeying mechanically
[01:22:43] have no organic thinking response to the commander's will so i mean how how poignant is this
[01:22:49] first what we live in today right everyone thinks they can just send a text message in the problem
[01:22:54] solved make a quick phone call on the problem solved and actually the reality is sometimes you
[01:22:59] need to get down there you also the whole thing about it controlling you you know i mean
[01:23:04] do you ever forget your do you have that at all like when you leave your phone at home or in
[01:23:10] the car something like that where you don't have it for like yeah you know i don't forget things
[01:23:14] a lot so i don't that doesn't really happen me a lot but yeah i would say if if i left my phone
[01:23:20] somewhere i would be like oh dang i want to try and call me right now one if there's an emergency
[01:23:25] going on yeah what's weird but you know back in the day when we're you know whatever
[01:23:30] teenagers or whatever pre cell phones pre cell phone yeah there was no internet i was telling
[01:23:40] my kids the other day that when i was a kid there was no internet that was not a thing yeah that's
[01:23:46] like saying there's no roads yeah for that that this is the same thing yeah for my kids they're like
[01:23:51] what they were looking me like what what did you believe i didn't you know just because you
[01:23:56] you had to go to the library no to look something up get an encyclopedia i remember thinking
[01:24:03] in cyclopedias were were like holy yeah i don't know mean there were so in dictionaries i
[01:24:09] thought that was like a like a holy book i filled my mom at a ad a ad an oe de oxford english dictionary
[01:24:18] not the the four one is a volume the four one is twenty six volumes or something crazy like
[01:24:23] but my mom had one that was big i mean it was big it was six inches thick yeah it was like six
[01:24:30] maybe six inches thick and big and it had little tabs little indentations bigger yeah you think
[01:24:36] about it but to me that thing seemed like some kind of bible yeah some kind of just seems
[01:24:43] so filled with knowledge and if you didn't know what a word was you just had to go look it up
[01:24:48] and that thing you didn't know what a thing was you look it up in the encyclopedias you go
[01:24:52] library and look it up in the encyclopedias nowadays you're three seconds away you got that
[01:24:57] google yeah you want to look in the dictionary dot com dictionary dot com bo need those fingers
[01:25:02] unless you got that really the app oh you the app won't even better because you got to
[01:25:07] want to get that etymology of the word to you on the word it comes on that stuff yeah
[01:25:11] then you got what what's the the street language what is that one uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[01:25:17] urban dictionary yeah that's kind of fun balance alert but here's the thing it's weird it's like
[01:25:22] it is fun and it's funny but it's very useful because you know when people they'll say stuff
[01:25:26] and you're like wait wait I had to look some things up on urban dictionary a couple times i'm trying
[01:25:30] to think of a good example right now but i can't think of one next time i will i will note
[01:25:36] that it cuz you know i got teenage kids so sometimes they got some words yeah you got to know
[01:25:41] that's like we're saying something a couple years ago hi fee remember i don't remember that
[01:25:46] oh well that's not all that's new hi fee what does it mean well i don't know if i can define
[01:25:52] it specifically but it means like get fired up like it's like dope oh okay hi fee okay
[01:26:00] oh fifty cent or somebody i don't know anyway but yeah but that's the thing though you you
[01:26:05] lose or you forget yourself on you go to the store i don't know you go to the vans and you leave
[01:26:11] by accident or whatever your phone at home it's like oh yeah and just like how you said
[01:26:16] you got those thoughts like oh what if there's an emergency what if someone's calling me kind of
[01:26:19] thing yeah all you got to do is black press it calls yeah yeah or this is the one day that there's
[01:26:24] like any emergency i'm not to say that you can't have an emergency you totally can't but it's like
[01:26:28] of literally the 99.99 99 99 9% of the time you have access to that phone that one teeny tiny
[01:26:37] sliver of time that you don't oh now all the emergency is gonna come soon say and you think back
[01:26:41] to when you when there was no cell phones it's like how did you ever get along no i'm doing that right
[01:26:46] now i'm going with my cell phone but everyone around here's a thing though with that everyone around
[01:26:54] you kind of feel the same thing so like for example if you go to the store or if i go to the
[01:26:58] store people know i go to the store or people know i went to store my wife knows you know
[01:27:04] maybe if i'm like hanging out with friends or i'm gonna store real quick right we're having a barbecue
[01:27:09] I don't know they expecting me to have my phone and i expect to have a phone so it's like that
[01:27:15] communication now communication the standard of communication is way higher now yeah so you say like
[01:27:20] you're access to someone else is okay one thing that is a kind of a bummer and i you know for a long
[01:27:27] time i responded to like everybody that reached out to me and and i just can't i mean i can't do it
[01:27:34] i just i would be doing nothing but sitting around doing that yeah and it's really cool man i
[01:27:39] get letters and emails and facebook and dms on you know and i just don't have time and i feel bad
[01:27:50] you know i read most everything but it's been getting crazy and here's the thing and i think
[01:27:57] this is important to understand overall for kind of you for sure for everyone when someone you know
[01:28:04] how like someone will text you or someone will send you like a message like a long message and some
[01:28:10] it's easy to think like hey you could have responded with like just something you know rather
[01:28:15] than nothing but here's the thing it that's not true because someone sends you a text message or
[01:28:19] especially something long and meaningful like you don't want to just reply back with okay or okay
[01:28:25] a text you later more about this message that that makes way less sense you want to have something
[01:28:30] kind of thought out yeah so it's not just a small little response or you who doesn't have time
[01:28:35] to send one text well the thing is yeah physically sending the text doesn't take any time
[01:28:41] but to consider you're a valid or appropriate response to most text and in a special in your case
[01:28:48] where you get messages legit messages you can just be like cool yeah and then move on to the next
[01:28:53] thing you can't do that so you gotta like consider all these things and then all that consideration
[01:28:58] that's what takes the time yeah and mental energy by the way like like for like you can't go
[01:29:03] in one direction mentally and just pivot real quick and be like yeah let me just mentally accommodate
[01:29:08] this you know it's like man it takes more thought than that so it's hard to fit it all in
[01:29:12] especially for you know it is man i feel bad when i can't get back to people but i appreciate them
[01:29:19] reaching out and letting me know that they're getting good information right whether it's work
[01:29:28] related whether it's individual person related their kids whatever warrior i mean all kinds of
[01:29:33] good stuff and i'm so stoked but like you said it's like like i can't literally just cannot
[01:29:40] see that's tried yeah yeah yeah and i tried so i posted uh today i was like hey it's Monday
[01:29:50] sometimes life gets up or hand you gotta go you gotta attack yeah and that's why i was feeling
[01:29:55] this weekend i was like because i've been on the road we went to Maine didn't get a lot of work
[01:29:58] done to Maine because we were working in Maine we were rolling and then we were working in recording
[01:30:04] podcasts and interviewing and all that stuff so didn't have a lot of time out there got a little
[01:30:08] bit behind life got the upper hand on me and so i was kind of feeling it on when i got home and
[01:30:16] then when i said it was oh you know what i'm gonna do so Sunday i just i'm just gonna work all day
[01:30:21] just get just get busy get the upper hand because people were talking about the kids podcast
[01:30:28] hip podcast yeah where's the other you know hey hey my kids love listening to it
[01:30:33] when listening to it for the we're listening to the first 16 episodes for the ninth time now
[01:30:37] can you make another one or are you giving up on that like oh those are straight up five times
[01:30:44] yeah so so i got after that recorded some of that today but well that's what i did go on
[01:30:49] the attack like and that really does it really like by the end by by the end of Sunday i was like
[01:30:55] oh i got and i thought i thought it's gonna be a late night on Sunday i thought midnight
[01:30:58] which you know i don't want to go to bed a midnight on the Sunday night i got to god
[01:31:03] done it's like 945 at night i was like oh yeah and i was ahead i was back ahead but i had to get
[01:31:10] aggressive i had to dig deep i had to go like okay this is what's going on so if you start feeling
[01:31:15] that little life's getting the upper hand if you if you let it continue to maneuver on you
[01:31:21] it's gonna get worse if you go oh oh you think you're gonna get the upper hand i mean watch this
[01:31:26] i'm gonna get aggressive i'm gonna knock out so much stuff in the next 24 hours you're not
[01:31:30] gonna know what just happened son yeah so that's how i went at you know as is actually i
[01:31:35] made the video on monday technically it was a Sunday evolution but by the time monday
[01:31:39] little around i was back in the game yeah that's too hard it's good like if you get the or
[01:31:44] it's something someone else something else gets to the upper hand it's like dang you got to
[01:31:49] work double time just so it doesn't have the upper hand any more once you get the upper hand okay
[01:31:53] yeah you can boom you can find your way the way when when you get the upper hand
[01:31:58] it's like when you're playing a sport and the team starts to get the little upper hand and then
[01:32:03] they just they can start taking a little bit more risks they get a little bit more confident yeah
[01:32:07] and they get them will match yeah they get them momentum and they start going and that's productive
[01:32:12] right that they they widen that score run up the score boy and so that's the same thing i'm thinking
[01:32:19] but i had me on the ropes a little bit you know it was on the ropes i was on the ropes over here and
[01:32:24] i had to think i had to get it i woke up early and i was just boom i'm gonna start hammering
[01:32:30] and that's what you got to do finished reading a book wrote another book edited a book i had to
[01:32:35] postak a stuff come get some be aggressive okay so the communication things here's the other
[01:32:45] thing that happens with modern communications text messaging emails you start losing that little
[01:32:53] personal touch which is important here we go back to the book with his characteristically warm
[01:32:57] humor general Eisenhower has commented on the value of the personal factor in the command
[01:33:02] relation to his men under the conditions of modern war i found that it did a great deal of good
[01:33:08] to get down to my troops in the combat area my presence relax them and made them feel more comfortable
[01:33:16] about the situation but i was not deceived as to the reason i knew what was running through
[01:33:21] their minds they were saying to themselves there must be less danger than we thought or the old man
[01:33:27] wouldn't be here yeah get down talk the troops here we talk about this is a part of the nature
[01:33:35] of the combat soldier once he loses that faith it becomes very difficult to resolve it he will
[01:33:42] lose it very quickly when he sees that casualties are wasted on useless operations or when he
[01:33:48] begins to feel that he is in any respect the victim of bad planning or faulty concepts that's
[01:33:56] important then he responds to that principle which was once well stated by general james harbored
[01:34:07] discipline and moral influence the inarticulate vote that is constantly taken by masses of men when
[01:34:15] the order comes to move forward when the order comes to move forward a variant of the crowd
[01:34:21] psychology that inclines it to follow a leader but the army does not move forward until the motion is
[01:34:28] carried unanimous consent only follows cooperation between the invid individual men in ranks
[01:34:36] that's a bold statement like hey you can give that order but until everybody kind of knows that
[01:34:40] it's a good plan we're not knowing here's another good statement by rough approximation 60% of the
[01:34:52] art of command is the ability to anticipate 40% of the art of command is the ability to improvise
[01:34:59] to reject the preconceived idea that has been tested and proved wrong in the crucible of
[01:35:04] operations and to rule by action instead of acting by rules that's a good one by the way that's the
[01:35:14] entire art of command that's 100% anticipation and ability to improvise obviously there's some more
[01:35:22] factors those are some important ones and I don't think I pulled it out but there's also one
[01:35:28] part in the book where it says anticipation is important but it's but it's you can't just say someone hey
[01:35:34] anticipate harder and anticipate more it's hard to say to that someone someone's got to have experience
[01:35:41] someone's got to have the mindset for it they got to they got to free their mind it open their
[01:35:45] minds so that they can be aware of little nuances that are happening and changes that are occurring
[01:35:51] and you can't be down in the weeds or else you can't anticipate anything because you're getting
[01:35:55] knocked around in the dust and the dirt yeah so it's kind of like a pay attention kind of thing like
[01:36:01] it's a it's a way of paying attention I think really the key is detachment because if you can't
[01:36:08] detach you're not going to be able to anticipate anything because you're in and that's why there's
[01:36:11] obviously dichotomy here yeah do you want to go down and be with the troops absolutely but can you
[01:36:15] go down and be with troops so much that you lose track of what's happening at a strategic level
[01:36:19] and you can't anticipate what's happening no you can't do that dichotomy leadership you got
[01:36:23] to balance it back to the book during war it often time happens that one company by trial and
[01:36:30] error finds the true solution for some acute problem which concerns everyone but when that happens
[01:36:36] to a company I can assure you that is the exceptional company officer who takes the initiative and
[01:36:40] passes it passes his unique solution along to his superiors even after he has proved and
[01:36:45] battle that the idea works a good company idea in tactics is likely to remain confined to one company
[01:36:51] indefinitely even though it would be a benefit to the whole military establishment this is
[01:36:56] where this is just dealing with silos it happens in the military it happens in the civilian sector
[01:37:00] somebody figures something out make keep to themselves the fundamental purpose of all training today
[01:37:07] should be to develop the natural faculties and to stimulate the brain of the soldier rather than
[01:37:15] to treat him as a cog which has been fitted into a great machine got to keep point that out
[01:37:26] loyalty in the masses of men wax is strong in the degree that they are made to believe that
[01:37:33] real importance is attached to their work and to their ability to think about their work
[01:37:39] so you got to get people engaged and people got to understand and believe that what they're
[01:37:47] doing is important and they got to have some kind of say they got to have some control over their own fate
[01:37:53] it weakens at every point where they consider that there is a negative respect for their intelligence
[01:37:59] this rule applies whether a man is engaged in digging a ditch or in working up a loading table
[01:38:05] for an invasion so if you have negative respect for people's intelligence they're not going to do a good job
[01:38:16] big chunk a little bit of a big chunk here to square training with a reality of war it becomes a necessary
[01:38:21] part of the young officer's mental equipment for training to instill in him the full realization
[01:38:26] that in combat many things can and will go wrong without it being anyone's fault in particular
[01:38:32] so what did I just say things are going to happen is no one's fault does that really
[01:38:39] does that really marry up with the idea of extreme ownership well not really great because I'm
[01:38:44] taking ownership of anything however keep listening war is aimed at destruction the fire and general
[01:38:52] purpose of the enemy are directed against one's own personnel material and communications with the
[01:38:58] objective keeping one's own design from coming into play small plans miscarried because the wrong
[01:39:05] man happens to be hit at the critical moment or the guns which were counted on are knocked out of action
[01:39:11] the problem of command in battle is ever to establish a safe margin which will allow for such
[01:39:18] misadventure there you go so things are going to go wrong but what you have to take ownership of is
[01:39:25] figuring out how you're going to have a plan that's going to overcome those problems back to the
[01:39:32] book but this much is certain there is no system of safeguards known to man which can fully
[01:39:37] eliminate the consequences of accident and mischance in battle hence the only final protection
[01:39:43] is the resiliency and courage of the commander and his subordinates so what does that mean when something
[01:39:50] goes wrong when something bad happens you adapt you adjust you you alter your plans and you continue
[01:39:56] forward you own it it therefore follows that the far object of a training system is to prepare the
[01:40:04] combat officer mentally so that he can cope with the unusual and the unexpected as if it were the
[01:40:11] altogether normal and give him poise in a situation where all else is in disequilibrium
[01:40:22] say all over and over again and how do you do that how do you do that in the civilian sector right
[01:40:26] prepare your people you role-play with people you give them hard problems you make them figure things out
[01:40:32] you put them in tough situations so that they become accustomed to it but how to do it I would say
[01:40:40] that the beginning lies in a system of schooling which puts the emphasis on teaching soldiers how to
[01:40:45] think rather than what to think even though such a revolutionary idea would put the army somewhat ahead
[01:40:51] of our civilian education that's a common thing that gets said in military training is teaching
[01:40:58] people how to think not what to think and this is a good the test of fitness of command is the
[01:41:06] ability to think clearly in the face of unexpected contingency or opportunity improvisation is the
[01:41:13] essence of initiative in all combat just as initiative is the outward showing of the power of decision
[01:41:22] think about this when you're raising your kids too that's a good little something to think about
[01:41:26] you want your kids to be able to think think get that's what we got to have doing some creative
[01:41:33] stuff right sure jiu jitsu's creative but you got to throw some other stuff out back to the book the
[01:41:44] darkest hour for the novice in war comes with the recoil after the unit has been had badly hit
[01:41:51] it is then that the young commander has greatest need of the friendship and steadiness of his
[01:41:55] superior or of any other officer whose judgment he respects criticism or tactical counsel are of
[01:42:02] no value at this time they can be given that later of necessary but in the wrong hour they add to the
[01:42:09] hurt led him get out his crying towel when he has told how it happened the important thing is that he
[01:42:18] be given a pat on the back and insurance and assurance that he did his full duty and some little
[01:42:23] reminder that while he may feel that his losses are excessive such incidents are unavoidable
[01:42:29] feature of combat and do not keep one from coming back in the next round in secret in sick
[01:42:36] freed sassons memories of an infantry man the young lieutenant tells of emerging from a bloody
[01:42:42] trench raid and meeting his kernel this was kind kernel kynjak i'd never met before and it was the
[01:42:50] first time i had ever shared any human equality with him he spoke kindly to me in his rough way
[01:42:56] and in doing so he made me very thankful that i had done what i could so i mean this is a very
[01:43:04] important especially for folks that are in the military or in services where you can take losses
[01:43:10] and that is when you're in charge it's the time is not then to provide tactical counsel
[01:43:17] right that's not the time first you got to let the person get over the emotional hump help them through
[01:43:23] that and if you got to go back and debrief later that's what you do i think everybody needs to pay
[01:43:30] attention to that and i mean you could say the same thing for businesses you know if somebody
[01:43:34] makes a big mistake and they feel bad about it and it hurts them or they get people fired
[01:43:38] they cost a bunch of money or something like you might not want to jump on their back immediately
[01:43:46] a man remains a man after he puts on a soldier suit death in the company is like a death in the
[01:43:52] family talk relieves tension okay talk relieves tension this is a tough one because guess what
[01:44:00] some people when something bad happens you know what they want to do they want to be left alone
[01:44:05] and yet it's talked that relieves tension and getting that out of which i agree with but
[01:44:10] again you gotta be tactful there's a dichotomy you just can't go hey man or you really want to
[01:44:14] talk to you about what happened it's like hey maybe that person needs a little time maybe
[01:44:17] that person needs a little space but you can't give them too much time because they're going to
[01:44:20] sit there and dwell on it so pay attention the unit which fights successful action but is
[01:44:27] without knowledge of its success may even ensure a great victory for some larger body and still
[01:44:33] emerge from the battlefield with a feeling of inferiority it's a complex sentence but what are you saying
[01:44:39] is like you make sure when your people do something good you tell them because there's a lot of
[01:44:43] times where people don't people don't understand what they did and how big of an impact it had
[01:44:48] and that's bad mmm here's a good one in combat nothing succeeds like success the knowledge of
[01:44:57] victory is the beginning of a conviction of superiority just as truly the saver of one small triumph
[01:45:04] will wholly drive out the bitter taste of any number of demoralizing defeats nothing succeeds like success
[01:45:12] now we get in this section tactical cohesion important I think about that you know there's a
[01:45:24] story and extreme ownership about the boat crews in the boat crew doing well and sometimes people
[01:45:29] say what you know what do the guy that do do different well the new leader do and I always say well
[01:45:33] what he got the team to do is get everyone in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction
[01:45:39] at the same time like if you can do that you're winning if you can do that as a leader if you can
[01:45:45] get everybody in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time you're going to win
[01:45:51] and you'd be surprised how often I see companies I see business I see military units where
[01:45:55] people are not rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time so that's what tactical
[01:46:00] cohesion is tactical he's just how can we get people to be working together and here we go
[01:46:06] getting the troops to that cohesiveness back to the book it may be done through one bold individual
[01:46:13] standing erect and saying to a few others follow me we are going on if a few rise and follow
[01:46:20] the entire line is apt to get in motion on the other hand if this same individual advances alone
[01:46:26] but says nothing it is unlikely that he will have any followers one word come makes his action
[01:46:33] tenfold as effective as if he plunges gauntly ahead in silence the act of moving is initiative
[01:46:40] the act of coupling motion with speech is thinking initiative and important very important
[01:46:53] here's talk about getting a gunfight the first thing you do is you hit the ground as reestablish
[01:46:57] contact with your men determine where they are and let them know where you are this this happens
[01:47:02] in business to something bad happens and we all go into panic mode and start focusing on
[01:47:06] our world as a leader you need to say okay guys here's what's going on here's where I am here's what we're
[01:47:09] going to do leadership leadership leadership leadership leadership the majority of small unit leaders
[01:47:19] do not take any steps toward restoring control from which alone can come unity of action
[01:47:24] some try to contact their men by voice or by relay a voice during an action while the
[01:47:28] matter prone the voice will rarely carry more than 25 feet this means that unless there is a relay
[01:47:33] of all hands under and and all hands understand what is being attempted the voice method is ineffective
[01:47:40] in the seal teams when somebody yells out a command everybody says it and it's the best it's the coolest
[01:47:46] thing it's not the coolest thing but it's pretty cool when you hear that word getting past
[01:47:52] and you hear the criticalness of an important command coming out and everybody says it and
[01:47:58] the it's just that's what you have to do and we're so well trained at that that's one of the
[01:48:03] few tactical things that you learn in basic underwater demolition seal training is you better
[01:48:08] pass the word pass the word man it's one of those things it's one of those things you learn to pass the
[01:48:13] word this is this is a great point the company coming under fire literally begins its engagement
[01:48:24] by falling apart so when you start getting shot at guess what you do you get down you can't say
[01:48:28] anyone else and you don't know what's happening so your first thing that happens when you get
[01:48:33] engaged is you fall apart there after so long as it continues to engage the overriding
[01:48:39] problem of the commander is the reunification of his elements this is a great way to think about
[01:48:43] all your tactical leaders out there military police firefighters this is important think about this
[01:48:50] after the thing after the engagement starts the overriding problem of the commander is the
[01:48:54] reunification of his elements proper fire support and direction are coming are among the
[01:49:00] tools which he uses and bringing about cohesion but the fundamental means is communication
[01:49:06] getting his men to link up by talking to one another and sending a long word of what they are
[01:49:11] doing and what they have seen now this is a very simple thing it is so simple that it recalls
[01:49:20] the warning from kernel GFR Henderson in war the simple things are the most difficult past the
[01:49:30] part we say that we seek initiative in our men that is the American way of fighting we say that we want
[01:49:40] men who can think and act we are just as steadfast however in proclaiming that the supreme
[01:49:45] object in training is to produce unity of action these two aims are not mutually exclusive in fact
[01:49:52] they are complementary halves of an enlightened battle discipline so do you catch that we want our people to act
[01:50:00] we want our people to act for themselves we want them to think and act and at the same time we want
[01:50:04] uniform unified unity of command we want them to be working together so we want them to act alone
[01:50:10] we want them to work together there's obviously a dichotomy there there's a complementary halves
[01:50:15] of an enlightened battle testament here we go this is beautiful but the various curious part of it
[01:50:21] is that is that training largely ignores the soul principle which makes these two basic ideas
[01:50:27] fully and finally reconcilable we do not teach our men from the day they first put on the uniform
[01:50:35] that speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat
[01:50:40] speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat we do not say to them that for a man to be
[01:50:52] able to think straight about his tactical situation is not enough he must communicate his thoughts
[01:50:58] to others before they can begin to produce unity of action out of speech or from the written
[01:51:06] word which is it's substitute comes all unification of strength on the battle field and from the latter
[01:51:14] comes the decisive action this applies to two men serving together on an outpost it applies equally
[01:51:20] to the battalion or the regiment right there right there if you can't communicate with the other
[01:51:30] people and people don't spread the word and your team doesn't communicate well with each other
[01:51:35] you're not going to be able to join these two halves which is acting and being decisive and
[01:51:43] being using initiative and cohesiveness of your unit the question still remains what kind of
[01:51:52] initiative is beneficial and what kind is harmful and how may troops be might might be taught
[01:51:59] to distinguish between the two right so could a person on your in your cartoon takes so much
[01:52:04] initiative that it hurts oh yes they can I see many times before many times before I've seen that
[01:52:11] so the question is how do we know how much there's a dichotomy right we want people to action
[01:52:16] but we don't don't want to take too much action I'm glad I'm not the book that got me the
[01:52:20] issue yeah and here's here's his way of trying to define that is the soldier acting on his own
[01:52:28] to advise others of his tactical situation or conveying any other information which may be of general
[01:52:34] benefit in furthering the tactical situation of the company or in enlisting the aid of others
[01:52:40] in carrying out any action which will benefit the tactical situation of the company so you you
[01:52:47] need to take action you need to take initiative as long as it's benefiting the company
[01:52:53] as long as you're and you know what we talk about as commanders intent like you can do whatever
[01:52:56] you want as long as it's in support of commanders intent if it's non-support of commanders intent we
[01:52:59] get a problem in the army of the United States we act towards speech as if it were mortally as if we
[01:53:10] were mortally afraid of it we tell our men to think yet we never tell them that if in combat they
[01:53:16] remain dumb it is slow suicide slow suicide the period between wars was an age of rapid
[01:53:26] advancement in communications technique radio was born the telephone was vastly improved the
[01:53:30] teleprinter appeared in television waited just around the corner it all came so fast that we were
[01:53:35] struck dumb by our own magic how brilliant is that we were struck dumb by our magic how many people
[01:53:46] these days are are be not becoming good communicators because they're not interacting with people
[01:53:52] enough because instead of talking to them they're sending them an email that how is that affecting us
[01:54:00] pretty much everybody pretty much everybody I'm one of the people you've got emojis coming
[01:54:05] up right we got issues I don't know that might be in the step in the right direction right that
[01:54:10] additional emojis additional communication you know what it is it does add some clarity to your
[01:54:16] statements you know you credit maybe I need to get an emoji game maybe not out but you know that's
[01:54:24] a great thing to talk about raising kids to make sure you talk to your kids I work with someone
[01:54:28] once had had a kid that had like a speech impediment and this kid would just sit down and talk
[01:54:35] your ear off with speech impediment and and I talked to the parent and said hey you got one
[01:54:42] confident kid you know with speech impediment how did you get him to overcome you know this
[01:54:48] this speech impediment or the it's not so much the speech impediment because he didn't overcome
[01:54:52] it's still had it but guess what was going to talk your ear off and was going to sit down
[01:54:55] and act professional and get it convey his message and the response was got him to talk to people
[01:55:01] all the time and and made him talk to people and so that's what you do get have conversation
[01:55:08] with your kids how's that you have conversations with your people on your team how's that
[01:55:17] is that one of the reasons why podcasts are popular because you get to hear conversations between
[01:55:22] people because you're not here and then otherwise yeah maybe here's he's saying uh this is just
[01:55:29] good advice for this is good you follow you folks that are thinking about joining the military
[01:55:33] here we go when you prepare to fight you must prepare to talk you must learn that speech will
[01:55:38] help you save your situation you must be alert at all times to let others know what is happening to you
[01:55:43] you must use your brain and your voice anytime that any word of yours will help you or others
[01:55:50] you are a tactical unit and you must think of yourself that way don't try to win a war or
[01:55:56] capture a hill all by yourself your action alone means nothing or at best very little
[01:56:03] is when you talk to others and they join with you that your action becomes important
[01:56:10] got to communicate
[01:56:12] this is life tells the story about me telling him to use verbal commands and we've got
[01:56:21] that story over and over again because I've done it with so many different people like you
[01:56:25] need to you need to use your man voice right now like you're not being loud enough and that was
[01:56:31] a classic example of that you know life trying to communicate over the radio and people are
[01:56:36] really listening because it's put noise in your ears and all these things happen and you're
[01:56:40] you know you're here little voice and in the sealed teams like I said we're so trained to repeat
[01:56:44] those commands and I'm like life you gotta try using verbal commands bro you gotta try it and he
[01:56:50] kind of looked at me like man I'm given the perfect brief over the radio right now my man will respond
[01:56:56] and so finally you know he's you know angry lathe came out and he's got it and you're
[01:57:00] everyone yelled and everyone repeated and everything happened and it was one of those things and
[01:57:05] that's I mean this is what 10 years ago 15 12 years ago but it was definitely we all had radios on
[01:57:13] and everybody every single person had a nice radio the same radio that's being used today
[01:57:17] with a with a noise canceling headset do you know what that is? Yes, right. Okay yeah so I know
[01:57:21] he's canceling it so you'd think what could be better than that what could be better than this
[01:57:26] brand new modern technology with a noise canceling headset you know it's better than that your voice
[01:57:30] Yeah yeah, yeah. I'd think that's saying a lot with the voice canceling headset and even even
[01:57:35] then the voice is better. Yeah, well when you got the noise canceling headset it shuts off the sound.
[01:57:42] So when you're shooting your gun there's no sound coming in now you don't hear whatever's being told you
[01:57:49] check
[01:57:50] Alright one final statement on that men governed by words
[01:57:54] speech galvanizes the desire to work together is the beginning of the urge to get
[01:58:00] something done. So learn how to communicate. Read Study English. Learn how to write.
[01:58:09] It's going to make you better communicator. All right. Now we go to Why Men Fight.
[01:58:15] When a retrograde movement becomes necessary in combat, it is an invitation to
[01:58:21] disaster to move before the men are told why they are moving. If the pressure is made,
[01:58:27] the fact that that fact obvious, then they still must be told how far to go and the
[01:58:31] line or point to which they're withdrawing must be made clear and unmistakable.
[01:58:35] Otherwise, they will keep moving and all control will be lost. The spoken word is
[01:58:40] the greatest of studying forces in any time of crisis. Think about that. The spoken
[01:58:47] word is the greatest of studying forces in any time of crisis. An excited lieutenant
[01:58:53] shouting, get that out of here and follow me to that tree. If follow me to that tree
[01:58:57] line on the far side of the creek, we'll succeed. The little perfectly calm captain
[01:59:03] trying to bring off the same movement but keeping his voice down with the result
[01:59:08] that the men do not hear him will fail. That's obvious. Formal language under these
[01:59:14] circumstances is almost unknown in the army of the United States. In fact, get the hell out
[01:59:20] of here has virtually established itself in our jargon as the customary order.
[01:59:30] Said, dren general dragon, dragon mirroh. A strong moral education is the best safeguard
[01:59:39] to solidarity of troops under fire. Even so, the soldier will forget or discount much
[01:59:45] that training has taught him as the danger mounts and fear takes hold. It is then the
[01:59:52] voice of the leader must cut through fear to remind him of what is required. The reason
[02:00:00] to explanation of why this is true has never been more clearly stated than by staff sergeant
[02:00:07] Pete F. Dyne of the 17th Infantry Regiment after he had won the silver star for taking over
[02:00:14] the leading of a demoralized platoon during the Burton Island fight.
[02:00:22] And here's staff sergeant Pete Dyne. I knew that the men were afraid and careless at the
[02:00:27] same time. Though some were being killed, the others would not take even average precautions
[02:00:32] in going after the enemy installations as we passed through them. I knew they were afraid
[02:00:38] because I was aware of my own fear. Then I asked myself why it was that we felt fear in
[02:00:46] each other and I realized it was because all of the leaders had quit talking. I knew
[02:00:52] then that the only way to get confidence back into the platoon was to talk it up as a man
[02:00:57] might do in a football game. I continued my own attack on the enemy shelters and spider
[02:01:03] holes, but there was a difference. That now began yet that I've now began yelling to
[02:01:10] others. Watch me. This is what your supposed to do. Get at it. Keep working. Keep your eyes
[02:01:15] open. Soon the platoon became collected and began to operate methodically. But I kept
[02:01:21] talking until the end because I had learned something new. Leaders must talk if they are to
[02:01:27] lead. Action is not enough. A silent example will never rally men. Get some or get at it.
[02:01:40] In battle, back to the book. In battle, the voice of the leader is always needed to call
[02:01:45] back the man from carelessness. It is their chronic attitude in and out of danger. Even in veteran
[02:01:52] troops, it is not expected. It is not the expected presence of the enemy, which keeps them
[02:01:57] alert on a hostile field, but the force with which they feel pressing them at any given moment.
[02:02:04] When fire comes against them, they sense danger from every direction unless they are informed
[02:02:09] of the source of the danger. There is apt to occur swift moral transition in which they become
[02:02:15] mentally pinned by the mere incidents of fire. Like that's a mentally pinned. You don't know
[02:02:21] what's going on. So this was interesting. On seven occasions, it has been part of my duty to
[02:02:28] investigate the sources of panic along the battle line twice in the Pacific in five times in
[02:02:34] Europe. There was times where people just panicked and left the line and he had to investigate them.
[02:02:43] And he goes into that was how each of these incidents, each of these seven incidents got
[02:02:47] it start. One or two or two or more men made a sudden run to the rear, which others in the vicinity
[02:02:55] did not understand. But it was the lack of information rather than the sight of running men,
[02:03:01] which was the crux of the danger. For in every case, the testimony of all witnesses clearly
[02:03:06] developed the fact that those who started the run and thereby spread the fear which started the
[02:03:11] panic had a legitimate or at least reasonable excuse for the action. It was not the sudden motion
[02:03:17] which of itself did not did the damage, but the fact that the others present were not kept informed.
[02:03:24] Got it, you people got to know what's going on. For example, a sergeant in the first battalion
[02:03:33] 502nd Infantry was hit through an artery during the Carratin caused way fight on June 12, 1944.
[02:03:42] It happened in a flash. One second he was hit and the next he was running for a first aid
[02:03:47] station without telling his own squad why he was getting out. They took out after him and then
[02:03:53] the line broke. Others who hadn't seen the sergeant make his dash saw someone else in flight.
[02:03:58] They ran too. Someone said the order is to withdraw. Others picked up the word and cried it
[02:04:04] along the line with draw, with draw. It happened just as simply as that. You can see how that happened
[02:04:11] all day long, right? The term control is not in this instance to be considered as synonymous
[02:04:18] with the voice of authority. Control is a man to man force on the battlefield. No matter how
[02:04:23] lonely his rank any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.
[02:04:30] That's legit. Any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.
[02:04:36] Fear is contagious, but so, but courage is not less so. To the man who is in terror and
[02:04:43] virgin on panic no influence can be more steady than that he sees some other man near him who is
[02:04:49] retaining self control and doing his duty. It's weird how people are just so influenced by other
[02:04:57] people. Let me see it everywhere. Personal honor is the one thing valued more than life itself
[02:05:07] by the majority of men. The lips of the dying attest how strongly this force influences
[02:05:13] individual conduct in battle. A young company runner hit by a shell at Carataine collapsed into
[02:05:21] the arms of his commander and with his life swiftly abing said captain this company always called
[02:05:28] me a screw up. Tell me that I wasn't. Tell me that I wasn't one this time. The captain replied
[02:05:35] no son you sure weren't and the board died with a smile on his face. The Wallen army is a collection
[02:05:45] of individuals. It is also a crowd under pressure and under pressure it tends to ever to
[02:05:52] revert to crowd form. The seeds of panic are always present in troops so long as they are in
[02:05:58] the midst of physical danger. The form of which changes moment to moment. In the majority of men
[02:06:03] the retention of self discipline under the conditions of the battlefield depends on the maintaining
[02:06:09] of an appearance of discipline within the unit. So obviously with businesses and with businesses
[02:06:18] you're going to business that like people are squared away. That's how they roll. And everyone
[02:06:22] acts squared away and you get some people that aren't and that's the image that's the culture
[02:06:28] of the company and no one squared away. Should the latter begin to dissolve so should the
[02:06:36] discipline within the unit begin to dissolve only a small minority of the most hardy individuals
[02:06:40] will retain self control. The others cannot stand fast if the circumstances appear to justify
[02:06:45] flight. When other men flee the social pressure is lifted and the average soldier will respond
[02:06:52] as if he has been given a free release from duty. For he knows that his personal failure is made
[02:06:56] inconspicuous by the general dissolution. To it is a normal tendency in troops that they will
[02:07:05] drift rearward from the fire line unless they are being given an active direction. But it is
[02:07:11] just as normal that they will reverse themselves quickly and return to their duty if given a firm
[02:07:16] order by someone whom they know. Yeah and if you're a business situation we just like put out word
[02:07:23] like like just something stupid like like you'll be in a store or something and people people will
[02:07:29] be like not knowing hey there's just someone say hey there's a register over here or like you're
[02:07:35] at a waiting and a line at a and a public event of some kind you know. Hey wrap this thing around
[02:07:40] wrap the line around and everyone just does it. Yeah yeah like it's a thing to kind of what you're
[02:07:47] talking about to be like at the airport. The day I was super late. Remember to get a lot of planes.
[02:07:53] You're gonna watch the DC and went to the wrong airport. Last minute. Last second by the way.
[02:07:59] Anyway I'm standing in the TSA line. I see super long by the way. When I see super long I mean like
[02:08:07] like you ain't got to make it flat. Yeah this long long like a long line like there was a crowd.
[02:08:13] Yeah. So I'm standing in line. I'm like you know when you're in a hurry you're always looking
[02:08:17] for a little shortcuts and I'll violate a few rules you know to get there quicker so I'm on the
[02:08:22] lookout. Everyone else is just cruising just falling in line literally. So I look and I see a weird
[02:08:29] sort of line start of kind of the forming. Wait shorter too like the kind like I can like
[02:08:36] literally literally walk about 15 meters. I had to the end of this weird little line forming.
[02:08:44] Ever see it? It's a little line but it's kind of like one of the things I go about what we're doing
[02:08:48] and I think the lines make it even more psychologically rigid you know where it's like we're in line
[02:08:53] and to get out of line that's a kind of a big deal. Yeah well it's the social what is you call in it here.
[02:08:58] The social you get the release from social duty right. Yeah oh yeah yeah if you're
[02:09:05] showing everyone saying in line and you're just doing whatever else there's like a social
[02:09:09] pressure to stay in line. Yes exactly right so but boy man I was doing a mischief like so
[02:09:16] I ask oh how's this I ask the guy not like in that line because it's where ahead I ask
[02:09:22] the guy in the next line who's like maybe two three people ahead of me but in a different line.
[02:09:28] I was like is that another line and he you know he says he said yeah it is he goes yeah it is
[02:09:33] so I go I just go he already knew it but then he was like standing it like he didn't do it
[02:09:38] probably from that social pressure so of course I go and then everyone falls. I look behind everyone
[02:09:43] I feel like a commotion behind me but it's just so many people feeling in that's how freaking leading
[02:09:49] from the bottom and it made the flight by literally like what 10 seconds probably you're close.
[02:09:55] Yeah. This is again I kind of covered this moment ahead at one more time.
[02:10:04] Individuals, Traggers had almost no combat value and inducted into a strange organization.
[02:10:10] The majority of them were unwilling to join any such solid unit which still facing the enemy.
[02:10:15] The minority even after being given food and a little rest took their place in line but the moment
[02:10:21] the new unit came under enemy pressure the individuals quit their ground and ran rearward or
[02:10:26] sought cover behind somewhere behind the combat line. So this is what I would talk about. You get a new
[02:10:31] person and they don't know anyone they're not going to do their job on the other hand. This is
[02:10:35] important for businesses on the other hand that was not true of gun crews squad groups or
[02:10:40] Paltoon which had been routed from their original ground and separate from their parent unit but had
[02:10:45] managed in some way to hold together during a fallback upon being inducted into a strange
[02:10:50] company they tended to fight as vigorously as any element in the command which they had newly joined
[02:10:56] and would frequently set an example of initiative and courageous action beyond what had been
[02:11:01] asked of them. Think about that. Keep your little elements together. I used to be real big on that.
[02:11:08] You got your little fire teams and I was always trying to keep a little fire team integrity.
[02:11:13] Keep that fire team integrity. And these are like in a sealed tune there's four fire teams in
[02:11:18] a task unit. You know there's eight fire teams trying to keep these guys still know each other but
[02:11:22] they're going to do a little bit better. They just keep that fire team integrity. No each other.
[02:11:25] They already know what's up. In our striving for a system of discipline which recognizes in theory
[02:11:34] they'll the theories offered in order to practice that the relationships within our army should be
[02:11:38] based upon intimate understanding between officers and men rather than familiarity between them
[02:11:45] on self-respect rather than fear and above all on uniting comradeship.
[02:11:55] Self-respect rather than fear. This is they have destroyed the name and tradition of old and
[02:12:04] honored regiments with the stroke of a pen for convenience sake. They have uprooted the names and
[02:12:10] numbers which had identity with a certain soil and move them willy nilly to another soil.
[02:12:17] They have moved men around as if they were pegs and nothing counted but a specialist classification
[02:12:23] number. They have become fillers of holes rather than architects of human spirit.
[02:12:30] That's bold, isn't it? Yes, you like them. I do. So sometimes in the army and the army does this
[02:12:36] more than anyone else I believe. They'll just like take a unit that's been around for 122 years
[02:12:43] and fought in all kinds of wars and just disband them. They're done. Just get rid of them.
[02:12:47] And sometimes they bring them back thankfully but that's not a good idea. There's a certain power
[02:12:55] in tradition. There's a certain power in tradition. When they formed up Seal Team 5 they took
[02:13:03] they took Seal Team or sorry underwater demolition team 11 and they disbanded it and basically
[02:13:11] reformed it as Seal Team 5. But if you look at the symbol of Seal Team 5 there's a setting
[02:13:18] son and on the setting son is the number 11. You can see it go down. Little will fact for you.
[02:13:23] Pretty cool. But they at least kept that tradition alive.
[02:13:29] Yeah. And yes, this idea of fillers of holes rather than architects of human spirit.
[02:13:35] You got to think about what you're doing with the little units when you start breaking them up and
[02:13:37] moving people around. There's this there's relationships there that you're messing with. You might not be
[02:13:41] doing a good thing just because this guy has a certain qualification. I'll put him over there.
[02:13:46] They're in lies at great weakness and we have suffered from it through every war.
[02:13:51] For it must ever remain that acquisition of a true knowledge of the nature of man in war will
[02:13:57] suffice very little if put to work only by the local commander on limited ground.
[02:14:04] So everybody's got to understand that there's human beings working here that you're dealing with
[02:14:09] human that you have to be an architect of the human spirit. That again leaves too much to chance
[02:14:15] and puts too high a premium in on the virtues and talents of the average leader.
[02:14:19] What does need to primarily if we are to go forward the policy stemming from the top which are
[02:14:23] based not upon slide rule calculations but on knowledge of the human heart.
[02:14:32] Next chapter. The aggressive will. I like this little section.
[02:14:39] Moral is the thinking of an army. It is the whole complex body of an army's thought. The way it
[02:14:47] feels about the soil and about the people from which it springs. The way that it feels about
[02:14:52] their cause and their politics is compared with other causes and other politics. The way that it
[02:14:58] feels about its friends and allies as well as its enemies, about its commanders and gold bricks.
[02:15:05] About food and shelter, duty and leisure, militarism and civilianism, freedom and slavery,
[02:15:11] work and want weapons and comradeship, bunk fatigue and drill, discipline and disorder, life and death,
[02:15:20] God and the devil. That's a big, that's a big, that's what he's saying.
[02:15:28] Like you've got human beings and the morale of the army is all of that stuff combined together.
[02:15:34] You have to account for it. The definition cuts through one of the oldest myths in the military
[02:15:42] book that morale comes from discipline. The process is precisely the reverse. True discipline is
[02:15:52] the product of morale. Right? I never really thought about that too much. How's your morale?
[02:16:04] If you have good morale, you're going to have better discipline. If your morale is weak,
[02:16:08] what happens to your discipline goes out the window? The soldier needs a sound and vigorous body
[02:16:18] if he is to contend in modern war. But this itself should be the object rather than the
[02:16:24] perfecting of him in drills, not even remotely related to use of his weapons, out of a mistaken
[02:16:30] and obsolescent notion that they somehow improve his discipline. There's no such time for
[02:16:37] the method, for this method. So doing stuff just to do it, to like improve your discipline,
[02:16:43] is not what we're talking about here. Beyond the basic physical requirement, the essential is that
[02:16:49] he be given the freedom to think with a clear mind which freedom can be his only when he becomes
[02:16:56] convinced that the army and particularly the army as represented by his immediate
[02:17:00] superiors is doing everything possible for his welfare. You've got to care about your people.
[02:17:05] That's what Mook said. That's what Dezwit General Mookiama said. You've got to care about your people.
[02:17:10] Like 100% agree. Soldiers can endure hardship. Most of their training is directed toward
[02:17:17] conditioning them for unusual privation and exertion, but no power on earth can reconcile
[02:17:23] them to what common sense says is unnecessary hardship which might have been avoided by greater
[02:17:29] intelligence in their superiors. That is awesome. If your people do all kinds of take all kinds
[02:17:38] of punishment for you, but if they see that there's a way you could have avoided punishment for them
[02:17:42] and you didn't do it because you were dumb, they're going to rebel against you. The more intelligent,
[02:17:48] the more intelligent the soldier, the more likely it is that he will see as a sign, see that as a
[02:17:55] sign of indiscipline up above and will answer it the same way. So if the upper chain of commands
[02:18:01] drop in the ball, guess what's going to happen lower chain and where drop in the ball too.
[02:18:05] Nothing more radical is suggested here than that the leader who would make certain of the
[02:18:11] fundamental sound as of his operation cannot do better than concentrate his attention on his men.
[02:18:18] That's a bold statement. There's nothing better you can do than concentrate your attention
[02:18:27] on your men. If you want something to be successful, concentrate on your people. There is no
[02:18:33] other worthwhile road. They do only themselves who believe that there is a brand of military
[02:18:41] efficiency which consists in moving smartly expediting papers and achieving perfection
[02:18:46] informations while at the same time sliding or ignoring the human nature of those who may command.
[02:18:53] The art of leading in operations larger, small is the art of dealing with humanity
[02:18:59] and working diligently on behalf of men, of being sympathetic with them, but equally of insisting
[02:19:05] that they make a square facing toward their own problems. These are the real basis of commanders
[02:19:13] major calculations. That's just a awesome, that whole thing. The art of leading,
[02:19:20] dealing with humanity, working diligently on behalf of your men, being sympathetic with them.
[02:19:26] And at the same time dichotomy insisting that they make a square facing toward their own problems.
[02:19:33] Men who have been in battle know from firsthand experience that when the chips are down a man
[02:19:38] fights to help the man next to him, next to him, just as a company fights to keep pace with its
[02:19:43] flanks. Things have to be that simple. And ideal does not become tangible at the moment of
[02:19:49] firing a volley or charging a hill. Having already suggested that the thinking bayonets
[02:20:00] can never be subordinated by the routine methods of a discipline which is based largely in
[02:20:05] mechanical procedures, I will add that no leader will ever fail his troops, nor will they fail
[02:20:12] him who leads them in respect for the discipline life.
[02:20:19] Between these two things, discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military value of discipline
[02:20:26] lies all the difference between military, maturity and mediocrity.
[02:20:31] A salute from a willing soldier is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.
[02:20:40] It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by gust of wind, but a salute from the man
[02:20:45] who takes pride in the gesture because he feels privileged to wear the uniform,
[02:20:49] having found that service good is an act of the highest military virtue.
[02:20:55] One further fact that needs to be stressed about the character of those officers whose
[02:21:02] capacity could be measured in the efficiency of their companies while they were
[02:21:06] scrupulous in the care of their men, they were not wet nurses.
[02:21:12] They treated their subordinates as men. They did not regard them as adolescents and they did not employ
[02:21:19] the classroom manner in dealing with them individually or in the mass. That was an important part
[02:21:28] of their hold upon the men. The men prize a commander the more if he looks and acts the
[02:21:35] part of a soldier, but the characteristic of a fine appearance will but betray him the sooner
[02:21:41] if he has no real canship with the men. So he, this is dichotomy. You got to take
[02:21:46] air in your men, but you're not a wet nurse. You don't treat them like little kids.
[02:21:53] The characteristics which are required in the minor commander if he is to prove capable of
[02:21:59] preparing men for and leading them through the shock of combat with high credit may therefore
[02:22:03] be briefly described as one diligence in the care of men. So here's the characteristics.
[02:22:10] Number one diligence in the care of men. Number two, administration of all organizational affairs
[02:22:15] such as punishments and promotions according to a standard of resolute justice. Number three,
[02:22:21] military bearing. Number four, a basic understanding of the simple fact that soldiers wish to
[02:22:30] think of themselves as soldiers and that all military information is nourishing to their spirits and
[02:22:37] their lives. Number five, courage, creative intelligence and physical fitness. Number six,
[02:22:49] innate respect for the dignity of the position and the work of other men. I'm gonna tell you those
[02:22:55] are some good rules. Some good things to think about if you're in a leadership position.
[02:23:01] Here's a little commentary and it was written in 1947, might still be true today. It is my belief
[02:23:10] that there is no more hopeful doctrine put before our people today than that the army should
[02:23:16] duplicate the arrangements which obtain within the civil society, slavishly imitating the
[02:23:22] latter's comforts, social customs and ideas of regulating justice and insisting on no higher standards
[02:23:30] of personal responsibility for its people. So hey guess what, the military is not the civilian
[02:23:37] world and we shouldn't be trying to make it that way. The military is the military.
[02:23:44] That's 1947 he's saying that. I'm gonna have to say I agree.
[02:23:52] In my opinion and I do not say this lightly, the fault in our disciplinary level during World War
[02:23:57] II was not primarily that the discipline of the ranks needed to be more relaxed, but that the discipline
[02:24:03] of a considerable percentage of our officers needed to be tightened. For this simple reason,
[02:24:09] insofar as his ability to mold the character of troops is concerned, the qualifying test of an
[02:24:14] officer is the judgment placed upon his soldierly abilities by those who serve under him.
[02:24:20] You can only mold your troops if they judge you worthy of molding them. Think about that for a minute.
[02:24:33] If they do not deem him fit to command he cannot train them to obey.
[02:24:40] Thus, where slackness is tolerated in officership, it is a direct invitation to disobeyedience
[02:24:47] and as disobedience multiplies all discipline disappears.
[02:24:58] I love this little section right here. No officer can command unless he is certain of himself
[02:25:02] and confident that his orders are likely to lead to success. On the other hand, command does not
[02:25:08] create its own magic. Men who are filled with the spirit of disobedience will break the heart
[02:25:15] and ruin the character of the finest officer who ever lived. Men who deal with the rabble
[02:25:20] browsers out there. You're going to deal with some tough cookies. The way in which the loss of
[02:25:30] moral incentive is reflected in the tactile behavior of troops was thoughtfully expressed many
[02:25:35] years ago by the British teacher Colonel GFR Henderson. When troops once realized they're in
[02:25:42] fear-rewardy they can go they can no longer be dependent on. If attacking they refuse to advance
[02:25:49] if defending they abandon all hope of resistance. It is not the losses they have suffered,
[02:25:54] but those they expect to suffer that affect them consequently unless discipline and national
[02:25:59] spirit spirit are of superior quality and unless the soldier is animated by something higher than
[02:26:05] the habit of mechanical obedience, panic, shirking and wholesale surrender will be the ordinary
[02:26:12] features of the campaign. Pretty harsh warning. Nothing more unfortunate can happen to the commander
[02:26:22] than to come to be regarded by his subordinates as unapproachable for such a reputation isolates him
[02:26:29] from the main problems of command as well as its chief rewards. So you got to be approachable as a leader.
[02:26:35] This saying there's nothing more unfortunate than being regarded as unapproachable. It is back
[02:26:40] the book is never a waste of time for the commander to talk to his people about their problems.
[02:26:46] Here's a good people ask me. I get all the junior leaders from the military from the civilian
[02:26:51] sector from everywhere and they ask me what am I supposed to do? To the young officer whose conscious
[02:26:56] of his own reserve and his anxious to do something about it I can suggest nothing better than to
[02:27:02] make a habit of full physical participation. That is instead of watching the squad or a platoon
[02:27:09] workout or problem and either directing or criticizing its action. Let him pick up a weapon,
[02:27:14] relieve one man in the group, then let himself be the one commanded until the conclusion of the
[02:27:20] operation. Is this course of contact beneath the dignity of the American officer? Certainly not.
[02:27:26] So what does it get in the game? Getting the game.
[02:27:29] In the United States Service we are tending to forget because of the effective motorization
[02:27:40] that the higher value of discipline of the road march in other days that it wasn't that it
[02:27:47] hardened muscles but that short of combat it was the best method of separating the men from the
[02:27:53] boys. Always come back to a little road march action. Best method for separating a men from the
[02:27:59] boys is the road march. This is true today. Despite all the new conditions imposed by
[02:28:04] high velocity warfare, hard road march is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength
[02:28:11] of the individual man. The great advantage of the gain in moral force through all forms of physical
[02:28:17] training is that it is unconscious gain. All forms of physical training are going to give you an
[02:28:23] unconscious gain of moral force. Let that propel your workout tomorrow morning. Will power,
[02:28:30] determination, mental poison, mental control, all march hand in hand with the general health and
[02:28:35] well-being of the man. Fatigue will beat men down as quickly as any other condition for
[02:28:41] for fatigue brings fear with it. There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the
[02:28:48] road for lack of adequate preliminary hardening in troops. Such a condition cannot be redeemed by the
[02:28:55] resolve of a commander who insists on driving troops in extra mile beyond their general level of
[02:29:00] physical endurance. That's important to remember. If you've got people that aren't ready,
[02:29:05] doesn't matter how much you try and make them do something they're not physically capable of doing it.
[02:29:11] That's the reality. Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command
[02:29:18] and thus strike at the tactical efficiency from two directions at once. For when men resent
[02:29:25] a commander they will not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are
[02:29:30] gone. In this state, the soldiers every act is mechanical. He is reduced to that
[02:29:36] animatism of mind which destroys physical response. His courage is killed. His intellect falls asleep.
[02:29:43] Truly then it is killing men with kindness not to insist upon physical standards during training
[02:29:51] which will give them a maximum fitness for the extraordinary stresses of campaigning in a war.
[02:30:00] Killing men truly killing men with kindness not that they're physically ready. As the body is
[02:30:05] hardened so must the mind be steadily informed so that the soldier will take a reasoning view
[02:30:10] not only of the privations of the field but of that which is being attempted. Once we depart from
[02:30:15] the ideal of automatic responses the condition most likely to produce unity of action in battle,
[02:30:20] the only substitute for it lies in the possibility that more and more men in the ranks can be trained
[02:30:26] to see and think through the haze of battle in unison with their commanders.
[02:30:34] You can see, you can see, I mean when you read about face, there's the hack worth,
[02:30:38] this is what hack worth did, man this is how hack worth rolled.
[02:30:44] Fact. Back to the book, why is the will of the military commander deemed more decisive
[02:30:52] of success than the will of leadership in any other calling? Clear lead is because the inertia,
[02:30:57] frictions and confusions of the forces of the battlefield make all positive action more difficult.
[02:31:03] And yet the principles which win intelligent man to man cooperation apply equally in all circumstances,
[02:31:12] the same rules work on the battlefield as in an office. That's why we got to have something called
[02:31:20] Ashalon front. The will does not operate in a vacuum. It cannot be imposed successfully if it
[02:31:28] runs counter to reason. Things are not done in war primarily because a man wills it.
[02:31:35] They are done because they are doable. Okay, this is a really important little section.
[02:31:41] And, you know, I, you know, I talk about force of will. You're going to make something happen.
[02:31:47] Force of will. But there's a very important, I've called a caveat to that and we're about to
[02:31:53] get into this caveat. So to say that again, things not done in war, things are not done in war
[02:31:59] primarily because a man wills it. They are done because they are doable. The limits for the
[02:32:05] commander in battle are defined by the general circumstance. When he asks what he asks of his men
[02:32:11] must be consistent with the possibilities of the situation? That might seem like common sense, right?
[02:32:17] Hey, I can't ask you do anything that cannot be done. Yeah. Back to the book.
[02:32:22] What can be successfully willed must first be clearly seen and understood. If a mid the confusion
[02:32:29] of battle the commander sees what is required by the situation. If a mid the miscarriage of
[02:32:34] arrangements and other assailing doubts of other men, he measures the means of doing it. And if he
[02:32:39] then gives his order and holds his men to their duty, this is the ultimate triumph of the will on the
[02:32:45] battlefield. To reflect on this thought is to know that he exercises his will far less upon his
[02:32:53] men than upon himself. Should he on the other hand attempt to will that which his men know
[02:33:04] cannot be done or feel unanimously as utterly beyond reason or should he base his order on
[02:33:11] assumptions which they recognize as false his will becomes temporarily without power and cannot
[02:33:18] help the situation. This is one of those things where people think, I'm just going to tell him to
[02:33:24] do it and we'll see what they can get done, right? Like no, they're not going to see that they can't
[02:33:28] do it and they're just going to say we're not going to even try. Make your goals realistic. Make them
[02:33:33] not just realistic. Make them achievable. There is scarcely any commander with any time in combat,
[02:33:45] but has had his experience of having willing troops become suddenly unresponsive because his
[02:33:51] facts were not straight. So sometimes the troops aren't going to do what you want to do. Even though
[02:33:57] you have this strong will, they're not going to do. Why is that? Here we go. It happened to lieutenant
[02:34:01] Colonel H.W. O. Knard during the night advance of first battalion, 501st parachute infantry
[02:34:10] against the German held Dutch village in September 1944, the village of Shinjou,
[02:34:18] which I have praised elsewhere in this book as one of the most brilliant battalion actions of the war.
[02:34:25] The column had advanced only 500 yards beyond its outpost line when it came under machine gun and
[02:34:34] anti-tank fire. Knard heard some of the fire clipping the branches of the tree above his head
[02:34:39] and judged it was all going high. But the lead company had stopped and the men had jumped for the
[02:34:46] ditches. He ran forward shouting to the men, keep going, keep going, that fire is high.
[02:34:51] But his personal advance had no effect. Not a man stirred. So this is an incredibly
[02:35:01] like seasoned, I mean, tough well-trained group and he's telling them, he's personally leading
[02:35:08] him forward tanko. Go, go, we got to go. Don't worry that fire is high, but has no effect. Not a
[02:35:13] man stirred back to the book. Within a moment, he understood why he had failed from one of the ditches
[02:35:19] a rifleman answered him. If you think the fire is high, Colonel, come over here. We've had eight
[02:35:24] men hit in the legs. So you've got to think about what is actually possible.
[02:35:35] The supreme trial of the commander-in-war lies in his ability to overcome the weaknesses of human
[02:35:41] nature in the face of danger and these are the matters which he cannot know in full unless he
[02:35:48] is served with men where danger lies. Check. Chapter 12, men under fire.
[02:36:02] To those that have known the firing line, it would scarcely be necessary to point out that
[02:36:06] morale and combat is never a steady current force, but a rapidly oscillating wave whose variations
[02:36:12] are both immeasurable and unpredictable. It is in this respect chiefly, the rapidity and capriciousness
[02:36:21] of its variations that the morale problem in the zone of fire differs from that of a rear
[02:36:28] area soldiering. A band of men go through a terrible engagement, take its losses bravely,
[02:36:35] and then become wholly demoralized in the hour in which it must bury its own dead.
[02:36:39] A regiment, threaded to utter objection by a protracted stay in the lines may find its fighting
[02:36:47] spirit again in a six hour a spite during which the men are deloused and giving a chain given
[02:36:53] a change of underwear. A battalion advancing boldly may be brought in check because it's commander
[02:37:00] did the disservice of going too far forward and getting himself killed within sight of the ranks.
[02:37:06] A platoon may charge in capture and enemy hell, held ill, losing half its numbers and doing so,
[02:37:13] then run down the hill again because one of its own artillery shells landed too close and hit one man.
[02:37:21] So that the morale of the troops is constantly at risk of going up or going down.
[02:37:29] The near presence of death and the prospect of meeting it at the next moment move men in
[02:37:36] mere many curious and contrary ways, many men seem to change character under the guns.
[02:37:45] The life of hardship and of danger gives new strength to the truly strong and greater weakness
[02:37:51] to the truly weak. So combat is going to have an effect on people. It's going to amplify their
[02:37:57] situation. What normal man would deny that some of the fullest and fairest days of his life
[02:38:08] have been spent at the front or that the sky ever seems more blue or the air more bracing than
[02:38:15] when there is just a hint of danger in the air. This is an important thing for leaders to understand
[02:38:23] the man who cannot bring himself to trust the judgment and good faith of other men cannot command very long.
[02:38:31] He will soon break under the unnecessary straining puts on himself, sleeplessness, nervous irritation
[02:38:37] and loss of self control will be his... will be his lot until he is at last found totally unfit.
[02:38:46] The ideal relationship between a commander and his subordinate is nowhere better illustrated than
[02:38:52] an passage from the letter of instruction wherein Grant told Sherman to proceed to the destruction
[02:38:59] of Johnson's army. Quote, I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign,
[02:39:06] but simply to lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to execute it
[02:39:13] in your own way. Some decentralized command right there. This is another good one. When a company is
[02:39:24] stopped by physical shock restoration of its movement becomes a problem for the battalion.
[02:39:29] When a company is stopped by psychological shock, the continuing of the advance remains the problem
[02:39:35] of the company commander. And here are some examples of that. Defusion of the company over
[02:39:41] two-wide a sector, a retrograde movement by supporting weapons such as armor, the death of a well-loved
[02:39:47] officer, light losses from friendly supporting fire. The appearance of some new and unexpected weapon
[02:39:53] in the enemy sector such a few of the causes of psychological shock, the local treatments,
[02:39:59] arous many and is varied as are the diseases. With respect to the effect of friendly fire hitting
[02:40:05] among troops however, it is to be observed that if circumstances leave any room for doubt as to
[02:40:10] the source the men will jump to the conclusion that they are being victimized by their own guns.
[02:40:18] It is, in instances where it is unmistakable that they have been hurt by their own fire,
[02:40:23] however, the commander is ill-advised to lie to them. They will usually learn the truth later on and
[02:40:29] when they do it strikes a blow to his prestige. The experience combat soldier knows that such occasional
[02:40:36] accidents are part of battle and he accepts them as such but he cannot make any good judgment to
[02:40:41] the realization that his commander is either a fool or a liar. No gain ever comes from being
[02:40:48] slick with troops, from acting divviously instead of forthrightly, from posing as having superior
[02:40:55] knowledge or from being secretive or discounting the common sense of the majority. See a lot of
[02:41:00] people do that. They discount the common sense. They think they're going to get away with that with
[02:41:05] trying to bullshit the troops and it doesn't work. The most common cause of psychological shock
[02:41:13] however is partial victory. The adage at the weakest point follows success as a fundamental
[02:41:19] truth of minor tactics and the danger is always greatest when success is too easily won.
[02:41:25] Success is disarming. Tension is the normal state of mind and body in combat when the tension
[02:41:31] suddenly relaxes through the winning of a first objective. Troops are apt to be
[02:41:36] pervaded by a sense of extreme well being and there is apt to ensue laxness in all its forms
[02:41:44] and with all its dangers. He hammers this home. It might be well to speak of the importance of
[02:41:54] enthusiasm, kindness, courtesy and justice which are the safeguards of honor and the tokens of
[02:42:00] mutual respect. Respect between man and man. This last there must be if they are to go forward
[02:42:07] together. Prosper and one another's company and find strength in the bonds of mutual
[02:42:12] service and experience a common velocity in the relationship between the leader and the lead.
[02:42:19] Loyalty is the big thing. The greatest battle asset of all but no man ever wins the loyalty of
[02:42:26] troops by preaching loyalty. No man ever wins the loyalty of troops by preaching loyalty.
[02:42:38] It is given him by them as he proves his possession of the other virtues.
[02:42:46] The doctrine of a blind loyalty to leadership is a selfish and futile military dogma
[02:42:51] except in so far as it is enobled by a higher loyalty in all ranks to truth and decency.
[02:43:01] War is too, war is much too brutal a business to have room for brutal leading. In the end,
[02:43:07] its only effect can be to corrode the character of men and when character has lost, all is lost.
[02:43:14] The bully and the sadist serve only to further incomber in army. Their subordinates must
[02:43:22] waste precious time clearing away the wreckage that they make. The good company has no place for
[02:43:28] the officer who would rather be right than be loved for the time will quickly come when he walks
[02:43:35] alone and in battle no man may succeed in solitude. That's worth repeating. The good company has
[02:43:44] no place for the officer who would rather be right than be loved. We talked about that when Jordan
[02:43:51] was on. You don't need to be right when you're dealing with your significant other. No. That's not
[02:43:56] important. I have known a few brutal battle whose talents were so limited that they could not
[02:44:04] try no other means of command than the abuse of men. But I have yet to see one who did a good
[02:44:09] job of holding his command together when the going became rough and in the ranks fear of the
[02:44:14] enemy began to eclipse fear of the man up top. Now he here comes the dichotomy.
[02:44:23] Because he's talking about all these kindness and courtesy and justice and then he says
[02:44:27] ruggedness, ruggedness, toughness, ah, these are quite different things. So long as they are only
[02:44:35] the outer reflection of an inner determination and so long as the inner fire is tempered by a
[02:44:41] heart having real compassion for men, these are the best hands for the business. They will win
[02:44:48] the hearts of other men and will stimulate their valor. These others will try to be like them.
[02:44:53] For as a truth not to be denied that the rugged way is the natural way in battle.
[02:45:01] dichotomy right there. It tells this quick story. There comes to mind one last picture
[02:45:10] from the same campaign. The scene is stone-walled fort Montbury, the last obstacle
[02:45:17] barring entry into breast. A battalion of the 116th Infantry Regiment under major Tom Dallas
[02:45:26] has had the fort invested for three days. But the defenders have withdrawn to within the inner
[02:45:33] walls and will not surrender. The infantry fire cannot get at them. The ports have been
[02:45:38] flamed but without visible effect. Finally Dallas acts for three tons of TNT to blow the walls.
[02:45:45] He is given one ton, assisted by the infantry, the engineers lay the charge in a gallery
[02:45:52] under the wall. The work completed Dallas is ready to give the orders.
[02:46:00] Then he remembers, on the night before the battalion had attacked and Lieutenant Dürwood C.
[02:46:06] settles had been killed in the moat. There had been no chance to recover the body.
[02:46:12] It is still there and will be crushed by the falling masonry.
[02:46:18] So the demolition is held up and Dallas asks for a volunteer to go down to the moat,
[02:46:24] under fire and bring out the body. A young Lieutenant named Kelton responds.
[02:46:32] In a few minutes, Kelton returns with his burden. He says to Dallas,
[02:46:37] we are ready now. Dallas replies, ready? Then blow them all to hell.
[02:46:47] The charge goes off the earth shakes. The walls collapse with a roar.
[02:46:53] There is a stunned silence from within the fort. Dallas stands there for a few seconds
[02:47:00] and the tears fall as he looks down at the body of his dead officer. That is loyalty.
[02:47:14] It closes out with a couple more things. In every action larger small is decided by what happens
[02:47:20] up there on the line with where men take the final chance of life or death.
[02:47:26] Though I would not for a moment contend that modern war can be fought in one without vigorous thought
[02:47:33] and action on the home front, I deny absolutely that these things can vouch safe military victory
[02:47:38] anymore now than in the days when men fought with spears and crossbows. Any who look at war
[02:47:47] and think otherwise are citing through the wrong end of the telescope. They have become deceived
[02:47:53] by the vatness of the national preparation. How differently they would see things if it became
[02:47:58] their duty to measure the thin margins between victory and defeat on the field itself.
[02:48:05] The great victories of the United States have pivoted on the acts of courage and intelligence
[02:48:10] of a very few individuals. The time always comes in battle when the decisions of statesmen
[02:48:17] and of general generals can no longer affect the issue. And when it is not within the power of
[02:48:23] our national wealth to change the balance decisively. Victory is never achieved prior to that point.
[02:48:31] It can only be one after the battle has been delivered into the hands of men who move in
[02:48:36] imminent danger of death. Courage is the real driving force in human affairs and that every
[02:48:46] worthwhile action comes of some man daring what others fear to attempt. The man who is willing
[02:48:56] to fight for his country is finally the full custodian of its security. If there were no willing
[02:49:05] men, no power and government could ever rally the masses of the unwilling.
[02:49:10] To men who have been long and battle and have thought about it deeply, there comes at
[02:49:18] last the awareness of this ultimate responsibility that one man must go ahead so that a nation
[02:49:27] may live. And so the final and greatest reality that national strength lies only in the
[02:49:39] hearts and spirits of men. The army, navy and air force are not the guardians of its national
[02:49:49] security. The tremendous problem of the future is beyond their capacity to solve.
[02:49:58] The search begins at the cradle where the mother makes the decision either to tie her child
[02:50:05] to her apron strings or to rear him as a man. It continues through years of schooling when children
[02:50:16] are taught either to place personal interests up or most or to think in terms of their responsibility
[02:50:23] toward their society, their country and all of mankind. And there you go. Strength lies in the
[02:50:39] hearts and spirits of men and freedom lies in the courage and the discipline of daring to attempt
[02:50:52] what others fear. And I think that that reflects not just the strength and freedom of
[02:51:08] nations of countries but also of individuals. We are ultimately responsible for ourselves
[02:51:21] for our own freedom, for our own security. It is on us. And I think that is one of the
[02:51:33] or the most valuable lessons to learn from SLA Marshall. And you know unwillingly he also taught
[02:51:41] us a lesson about being truthful and honest which he was not and had he listened to some of his
[02:51:54] own teachings. He might not have made that mistake to tarnish his reputation. It's not worth it.
[02:52:00] He failed to listen to his own lesson. And maybe that's the last thing we learned is that we
[02:52:12] just don't just don't talk the talk, just don't preach. But walk the walk and live the life
[02:52:24] live correctly and follow the rules that you set for yourself. And then you go and you live
[02:52:40] with the courage and the strength and the discipline. So that you can truly free your mind.
[02:52:57] And I think that's all I've got for tonight, echo Charles. Yes. So speaking of
[02:53:06] strength and discipline and walking the walk and walking the walk and living the life
[02:53:13] staying on the path. Maybe you've got some things that could help us uphold the personal standards
[02:53:23] that we set for ourselves. Yes. I can. I will. SLA Marshall.
[02:53:30] Tautus a lesson he didn't want to teach us about that didn't he? Yeah, you know, there's one of those things where I was kind of
[02:53:36] getting into it. You know like I'm like yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's and then like kind of like how you
[02:53:42] meant you can from like wait, but this guy but then you know it's like it's the it's the that got to me. Yeah,
[02:53:47] it's the that got to me. It's an unfortunate that got to me. Yeah, see that's man. If this guy, if this guy,
[02:53:53] if we just knew about his normal military record and you never said he didn't have enough stuff,
[02:53:57] this would have so much more impact. Yeah. The fact that he lied just just it just hurts it.
[02:54:05] It's all there's to it jammed him up as as echo trolls would say. But you know, if you can
[02:54:12] how as it were not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yeah. Yeah. There's some of those
[02:54:19] stuff in there. Yeah. I'll tell you what is possible. This for us to stand the path.
[02:54:23] Yeah. And in that path on that path is jujitsu. Of course. Right. Better be for shibi. Should be in my
[02:54:32] entire team. You actually said today that that was one quarter of your life. It is in your life.
[02:54:37] One quarter of the things you do is jujitsu. You know of the total things that I do. Yeah.
[02:54:44] Important things because there's things that aren't on that list like no one will grow street store. Well,
[02:54:48] going in the grocery store does facilitate one of the other things in my life. See what I'm saying?
[02:54:54] Does not one of the things. It is not one of the things. No. That's like saying,
[02:54:58] okay, breathing. You know, well, bro, it breathing is not a part of your life. Well, yeah, but it
[02:55:01] facilitates other things. Okay. So if that's the case does origin facilitate jujitsu. Yes,
[02:55:09] it does. Big time. Which is good, right? Yes. So I eat food and you gotta have origin. Yes. Check.
[02:55:14] Big time. And okay. So origin. Okay. Origin main.com. This is where you can get your geat for jujitsu.
[02:55:21] If you haven't got one already, go get one. There's people out there who don't know any other geeks
[02:55:26] at for origin geat. Actually, some contact to me was like, hey, I realize, you know, origin is the
[02:55:33] geat, but before I buy one, would you consider donating one to my cause? I think they're like saving
[02:55:39] up from, you know, cause sometimes that's how, you know, you save up for your geat, whatever. So I'm thinking
[02:55:44] on one hand, the dichotomy. Sure. I'm never using these other geeks again. I wouldn't. Oh, I see.
[02:55:50] But on the other hand, why would I want to bestow a substandard geat on to someone just starting by the way?
[02:55:57] So it's like boom, they got that. But then again, no, I'll get, I probably will. I'll see.
[02:56:02] I mean, that's the size, you know. All right. Well, that's me. They're here nor there. And
[02:56:05] nonetheless, the point is if you want to get good geat, all made it America, various types of
[02:56:10] ships. I had when we were in Maine. So after the campus over at the factory, we were just
[02:56:16] getting stuff done and planning and everything. But he went into depth on weaving the fabric on the
[02:56:23] loom and everything. Bro. It's crazy. I've got full understanding, though. Yeah. And it's also.
[02:56:33] Yeah. It's awesome to see. It's interesting to watch Pete get into it. Just let him go. Yeah.
[02:56:38] Oh, yeah. For sure. Oh, man. That's why these things are like so dope when you look at him. That's why
[02:56:45] that's why that's why the company is where it is. Yes. Because without that passion for him for the
[02:56:52] team, like when you talk to anyone on the team in origin, they're like whining of this stuff to be
[02:56:57] awesome. Yeah. And so that's why it's that way. Yeah. Yeah. So it's cool. If you ever get a chance to
[02:57:03] go to the factory up there, it's worth checking out. Yeah. Because it isn't just like, oh, a factory.
[02:57:08] It's like a factory. You can hang out there. It's kind of like a, would you, it's a
[02:57:11] project like a pro shot. Yeah. You can kind of go in there and then it's like kind of open.
[02:57:16] You can talk to the people. It's good, man. That's good. Yeah. So yeah. Oh, yeah. I would recommend that to
[02:57:22] in farming to main, by the way. So it is anyway, also on there is joggers and rash guards and
[02:57:32] clothes. Yeah. For sure. For sure. The rash guards compression compression gear. Yeah. That's
[02:57:40] for your supplements as well. So you got for supplements joint warfare, which is going to help
[02:57:45] your joints for a bunch of different reasons. I get awesome compliments about that that I'm
[02:57:52] stoked on. That kriloil also going to help your joints and it's going to help you just whole life.
[02:57:59] And then you got the discipline, which I'm on a lot of discipline right now. And I didn't even realize
[02:58:03] we were at a three hour podcast at this moment in time and we recorded a couple other podcasts today.
[02:58:09] Yeah. The shorter podcasts, but podcasts, nonetheless. You over here getting the upper hand on
[02:58:13] life. Yeah. That's what's going on. Plus I did the three scripts of discipline. Yeah. I'm doing
[02:58:18] I have to feel like I understand it. So just one free life, pre-mission, pre-function. Yeah, pre-function.
[02:58:26] Pre-get some. Pre-get some. Yeah. You're going to get some in any format, mental format, physical format,
[02:58:35] that my middle daughter took the ACTs on Saturday and she came home. She I kind of fueled her up on
[02:58:47] some discipline before going in and she came back fired up. She was like, yeah, no, I felt so
[02:58:53] I was getting off. And I was like, yeah, you're just, you're just a discipline. Yeah, so it's one of the
[02:58:58] many schools I ever. And you know, she's not as big as me. No. I still gave her an opportunity to do this.
[02:59:06] I'm down for the three schools of discipline. By the way, yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's kind of a double effect
[02:59:11] and I could see how that could be. Especially if you go into some situation like a test. Or even like a
[02:59:15] jujitsu situation, whatever. Just get it. Just do it. Yeah. And then even afterwards, when you remember
[02:59:20] how like solid you were, you're like, you kind of get you fired up. Yeah. It's true. It's like a double layered
[02:59:25] thing. You got fired up because you got fired up. You like that, though, too. Yes, I do very much. And
[02:59:32] oh, yeah, and the last thing is, and it's not the last, but certainly not the least is something called
[02:59:36] mok. If you want to know what mok is, it's real simple. Mok is mok is mok. It's really nice. Yeah,
[02:59:42] if you want some additional protein. Right. I mean, mok pancakes straight out. How did you do it? Okay.
[02:59:48] Okay. So now you're going down this rabbit hole. It's making mok everything. Okay. Here's the
[02:59:53] thing. I'm sketch about the pancakes. Right. So first of all, I don't even like, I straight up
[02:59:57] don't even like pancakes at all. That's interesting. For me to even think about making mok pancakes,
[03:00:03] maybe it's something I could try because maybe I would like it. Well, if you don't like it,
[03:00:07] here's the thing. I'm not a mok pancake like expert at all. Okay. So I tell people how to make it.
[03:00:12] Well, here's the thing is how I made them. Okay. So I get tests with the way where they good.
[03:00:17] Because they weren't good. Let's not talk about it. Oh, they're real good. Yeah. So
[03:00:21] did you put maple syrup on it? I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did.
[03:00:26] Maple syrup come from origin. Main. Okay. That's okay. Well, then again, no, I can't say that. I don't
[03:00:31] think so. Not that I know it, but I don't read the bottle or nothing. Okay. Good. Oh, well,
[03:00:36] okay, on Saturdays or Sundays, depending I get I make pancakes. It says only one day. And then it's
[03:00:41] for the kids and all this stuff. So it's a thing. Oh, that's cool. Hey, you know what I'm going to do for
[03:00:45] you kids this weekend? I'm going to give you a bunch of carbohydrates and poison you. Yeah. Well,
[03:00:49] in my defense maple syrup. I got these or my wife got these paleo, but it's paleo pancake mix. Okay.
[03:00:55] Yeah. Check. Was that almond powder or something? Ah, I don't know. Okay. Paleo pancake mix. Check.
[03:01:02] So boom, I go in and you know pancake mix is like a certain kind of mix to create like a
[03:01:06] pancake. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why it is. But then I'm like, wait,
[03:01:11] I need to create pancake. I can make pancake mix. I could easily jam this whole thing up easily.
[03:01:18] And I'm not being able to just for me as an experiment. My kids are still on the way.
[03:01:21] She seems like, yeah, they're about to make it. But I give them more pancakes. They are not correct.
[03:01:26] I will hear about it. And the whole thing is a flop. Yeah. I guess technically I just make regular
[03:01:31] pancakes later. But it wasn't about that right then. There I was trying to deliver big time. So I
[03:01:34] can't just start throwing random ingredients and I'll recipe in the back of it. So this is what I did.
[03:01:40] It called for a cup and a third of pancake mix. I just put like a little less than a cup
[03:01:46] and then a third, a little bit over a third cup milk. Milk in there. A little bit of water.
[03:01:54] Some MCT oil. I put in. It calls for like you put butter and I did put butter. Like a
[03:01:58] grass-bed butter by the way. And there was an eggs. Yeah. Yeah. So you put an egg. Boom. Mix it all up.
[03:02:08] Pancakes. Oh, I put chocolate chips in the form of a happy face too. We did it all from time to time.
[03:02:12] And yeah. So we did that. Yeah. I'm more like a sad face at your house. But boom. I make them
[03:02:21] a little bit darker. Obviously because it was the chocolate peanut butter by the way. What's in the
[03:02:25] minute? Yeah. Well, yeah. There is darker brown. Yeah. Not the mint too. By the way, I think that
[03:02:33] you're risking jamming up pancakes for the mint. I think I don't know. I didn't do it. Anyway,
[03:02:37] yeah. Came a good boom. Maybe we'll syrup. Boom. Big hit. Kids like they kids didn't know. But
[03:02:43] they had the peanut butter kind of flavor in there. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the milk. It normally
[03:02:48] goes with milk. Or you can put it on water. But that's like a ham sandwich. Whereas if you put milk
[03:02:54] in there, it's like a delicious. You know what? It did do I put a two drops of vanilla in there?
[03:02:57] Oh. Andy. Andy Burke came home from camp. And we were just talking about camp. And
[03:03:04] this cool. He's like out with the awesome meeting to everyone and training in bubble
[03:03:08] ball. And he's like, you know what I really like though? And I was like, oh, why? He's my first
[03:03:12] time having more. Yeah. He's all. He's like, he's like, he's like, this is surprisingly good. Like,
[03:03:17] like, Brad, we already knew that. And I was like, ah, you, you do you think people don't
[03:03:22] believe it? Is your instinct to think, oh, this is some kind of a supplement. It's going to taste
[03:03:27] bad. And it's have to deal with it. But this one may be tastes okay. And therefore, you know,
[03:03:32] these guys are talking up. But the reality is the reality is it's good. Like a dessert. Straight up.
[03:03:39] Yep. It's like a milkshake. Yep. That's the milk. And has is good for you. That's the crazy thing.
[03:03:45] All right. So cool. That you can do all that stuff in origin, main dot com. Yes. And also
[03:03:51] jocquistorts called jocquistore. And this is where you can get shirts, hoodies, rash, other rash
[03:03:58] guards, more skewed towards the bad, the message. Well, call it the message. Anyway, there's some
[03:04:04] cool stuff on there. If you want to represent discipline equals freedom, because discipline does
[03:04:09] equal freedom, by the way. That's one of those things like you can think about that for like 20
[03:04:14] days. And it'll it'll make more and more sense over the 20, 20 days. And then after two years. And in
[03:04:20] my case three years makes even more sense. You see it everywhere. Just the fingers were busy. Yeah.
[03:04:25] And so it does. And if you want to represent jocquistore.com, that's where you can get the stuff.
[03:04:31] Cool stuff on there. So new stuff on there too, by the way. Really? Yes. I.e.
[03:04:36] Because you're making stuff. I don't even know about decentralized command style. Well, we got a
[03:04:40] few novelty items. You know, what I'm using is that. I'm assuming if I have it correctly, it's just
[03:04:46] something that's pretty cool. You know, got to go in there and find out any novelty items. Sure. You
[03:04:52] think people are going to read you think people on the path throughout spending their harder and money on
[03:04:55] novelty items. Is that what's going on? Uh, well, there's always layers. So it's not just novelty.
[03:05:01] It's still you're still representing big time. 100%. But some one of the layers is just quite novel.
[03:05:08] In my opinion. Anyway, go there. Jocquistore.com. Why is it so long? You're talking about it.
[03:05:12] Yeah, we're throwing that's why you got to know. It's going to check and check. Jocquistore.com.
[03:05:16] Yeah. Anyway, hats on there as well. A lot of just cool stuff. Anyway,
[03:05:20] Jocquistore.com. Good way to support. Good way to stand the path. It's just good all around. Good.
[03:05:27] David, did you see the, uh, what's the name? Um, not what's the name. But the, you know, the Nike commercial,
[03:05:35] right, you know, the Nike commercial has been in the news, right? The commercial, whatever. And
[03:05:41] Theo Vaughan was like, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[03:05:47] yeah, yeah, yeah. The opposite of it. The opposite of it. That was a thing. Yeah, you know what that is. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe not
[03:05:51] obviously. You know, when you look at it, it's like, yeah, hey, yeah, they did the same thing. But it, that way.
[03:05:55] I know where they got it from, you're not okay. Whatever. Um, but they did do the same thing. But here's what?
[03:06:02] Yeah, here's what I have really got from that whole thing. Especially his video. How he did it. He was like, watch it. You know what I did?
[03:06:07] It really illustrated that that concept like how we talk about all the time where
[03:06:10] When someone says good like that, it really stands out now.
[03:06:16] Like you see that everywhere.
[03:06:17] Even if you see the word good written on the sign or something,
[03:06:21] you're like, this is too jocous it.
[03:06:22] You know what I'm saying?
[03:06:23] So it sticks out in your mind just way more.
[03:06:25] And again, whether that happened or not,
[03:06:27] it's a weird word to pick.
[03:06:30] Yeah.
[03:06:30] That's a weird word to pick for the ad for the Nike ad.
[03:06:34] It's a little bit of weird word to pick.
[03:06:37] It's a little bit, it's not a normal word to pick.
[03:06:41] In my opinion, it's a good word to pick.
[03:06:44] But anyways.
[03:06:48] Nonetheless, good, that's all good, man.
[03:06:51] You're the man.
[03:06:52] Also, good way to support the seal.
[03:06:55] Do you still want to kind of hand my back though, didn't you?
[03:06:57] Oh, big time.
[03:06:58] Oh, yeah, what's up.
[03:06:59] Yeah.
[03:07:00] And it makes sense too.
[03:07:02] Yeah, just the whole, I mean, you know.
[03:07:05] But yeah, I think that when you hear that, you, I always hear,
[03:07:08] oh, joc, I just hear you saying it, you know.
[03:07:10] Even if I see the word good in all caps in a regular sentence.
[03:07:14] Like in a different context, I'll be like,
[03:07:17] You know, remind me of it.
[03:07:18] It just sticks out like that.
[03:07:20] I don't know.
[03:07:21] Anyway, good way to support also is to subscribe on iTunes and
[03:07:26] Stitcher, if you're Android, Google play and you know,
[03:07:29] wherever you where we listen to your podcast, just subscribe.
[03:07:32] And don't forget that there is.
[03:07:34] The warrior kid podcasts, you have which we recorded a couple more.
[03:07:38] Today, so we've got some fresh ones out there.
[03:07:40] I apologize for to everyone for taking so long to get those out.
[03:07:44] Life got the upper hand a little bit.
[03:07:46] We back, but that's like, yeah,
[03:07:49] I had to get default aggressive this weekend and just crush some of those.
[03:07:53] Yeah, so warrior kid podcasts for your kids and for, well,
[03:07:57] really uncle J.K. has less than for everybody.
[03:07:59] Also, warrior kid, there's a warrior kid at Irish Oaks Ranch.

[03:08:07] he's got a business.

[03:08:12] Yeah.
[03:08:12] Good soap.
[03:08:13] Good soap.
[03:08:13] Yeah.
[03:08:13] Good soap.
[03:08:13] Yeah.
[03:08:13] And you can get that there.
[03:08:15] Help help yourself.
[03:08:16] And you help yourself by staying clean.
[03:08:20] That's the idea.
[03:08:22] Stay clean.
[03:08:23] Yeah.
[03:08:24] The YouTube channel.
[03:08:26] If you want to see echoes legit video,
[03:08:28] Did you post the video that you just made for kids?
[03:08:32] The revenge.
[03:08:33] I call the revenge video.
[03:08:35] You call it the frigid.
[03:08:36] Yeah.
[03:08:37] That's interesting.
[03:08:38] Yeah, that is interesting.
[03:08:39] There's some of these things there.
[03:08:40] I have not posted that yet, but yes, yes.
[03:08:42] That's the YouTube video.
[03:08:43] YouTube channel, which is called Jocco podcast.
[03:08:47] It's a YouTube channel.
[03:08:48] You can watch all the YouTube videos on there.
[03:08:51] And then you can leave crazy comments from someone now and then a thing about all kinds of crazy stuff, which is fun.
[03:08:57] Sure.
[03:08:58] Whatever you like.
[03:08:59] Also, back back to working out.
[03:09:01] I got re-onit.com on it.
[03:09:04] The company on it.
[03:09:05] Don't.
[03:09:06] I got rings until you recently hear something about rings.
[03:09:09] Again, I said before, you're always preaching about the rings.
[03:09:13] Right.
[03:09:14] So, one of the what do you call it?
[03:09:15] The staples.
[03:09:16] It's actually, in many ways, considered to me to be the first thing you could get.
[03:09:21] If you had one thing you could get, you could get rings and you could do really well with them.
[03:09:26] Yeah.
[03:09:27] Now, reaping the benefits of the rings.
[03:09:31] They're like, they're actually pretty dope.
[03:09:33] Yeah, we got to get wood rings.
[03:09:35] I was telling everyone, get wood rings, not plastic rings, not metal rings, get wood rings because they absorb the sweat.
[03:09:39] They dig.
[03:09:40] Yeah.
[03:09:41] Anything else is slippery.
[03:09:42] They'll get debris.
[03:09:43] Yeah.
[03:09:44] And my kids are, you know, and they're adjustable.
[03:09:46] I've only had on it rings.
[03:09:48] They're cool.
[03:09:49] They're adjustable by number.
[03:09:50] And it's all the stuff.
[03:09:51] So my kids, two years old and five years old.
[03:09:54] They're swinging on them.
[03:09:58] They get real creative with them anyway.
[03:10:00] It's not yet one night.
[03:10:02] But I'll do that.
[03:10:04] It's all these little functional things anyway.
[03:10:06] There's a lot to be gained with the rings.
[03:10:08] I'm a gram of the lever of the rings now.
[03:10:10] And now I would agree with you 100 percent that that should be kind of the first thing I think.
[03:10:14] You can say a part of it.
[03:10:15] But you might as well get rings.
[03:10:16] You can do folks and you can do dips and you can do pushups and you can do muscle ups and you can do like weird.
[03:10:21] It's kind of squatting, planking.
[03:10:24] Oh, yeah.
[03:10:25] Yeah.
[03:10:26] App stuff.
[03:10:27] I can't do it by the way.
[03:10:28] Just in case anyone gets the idea that I can do it.
[03:10:30] I'm here to tell you I cannot even come close.
[03:10:32] Yeah, that would be pretty impressive.
[03:10:33] Because I just impressive even if a little gang.
[03:10:35] Yeah.
[03:10:36] Yeah.
[03:10:37] But here's the thing about rings and pull ups specifically.
[03:10:39] This is why it's better than a pull up bar.
[03:10:41] Because pull ups pull up bars coins.
[03:10:43] Good.
[03:10:44] Really good.
[03:10:45] I've had a pull up bar for a long time.
[03:10:47] But the rings is like, yeah, you can adjust for pull ups.
[03:10:49] And then you can adjust them down so you can do kind of like a rose.
[03:10:52] It's a way that you get their pull adjustable.
[03:10:54] You can do a piece of bra.
[03:10:55] It's a bra.
[03:10:56] That's the overall day.
[03:10:57] That's the overall.
[03:10:58] It extended my workout literally by like 30%.
[03:11:02] Dang.
[03:11:03] 30.
[03:11:04] Yeah.
[03:11:05] Yeah.
[03:11:06] Because there's other like I use them every single time.
[03:11:07] Yeah.
[03:11:08] You do your next exercise majorly.
[03:11:09] Anyway, you know what?
[03:11:10] Those are rings.
[03:11:11] This is a lot of other cool stuff on on it.com.
[03:11:14] So yeah, man.
[03:11:15] Brows around.
[03:11:16] See what up?
[03:11:17] Get something.
[03:11:18] Psychological warfare album.
[03:11:20] We're working on the next one.
[03:11:21] I'm thinking that the next one is not going to come out.
[03:11:23] It's going to come out right around Christmas is my guess.
[03:11:26] Yeah.
[03:11:26] So if you have anything, somebody wants one about shopping.
[03:11:29] Compulsive.
[03:11:30] How do I shop?
[03:11:31] Stop.
[03:11:32] Compulsive shopping.
[03:11:33] Yeah.
[03:11:34] I don't know if I can tackle that one.
[03:11:35] You know why?
[03:11:36] I have no compulsion to shop.
[03:11:37] I don't even like shop.
[03:11:38] I don't even like go to the store.
[03:11:39] You don't know.
[03:11:40] I don't buy anything.
[03:11:41] What the demons of shopping.
[03:11:42] Yeah.
[03:11:43] I've seen.
[03:11:44] No.
[03:11:45] I will say I've seen it because you see people that buy things that they can't really afford.
[03:11:47] Yeah.
[03:11:48] So I guess maybe we could talk about it because yeah.
[03:11:51] No.
[03:11:52] Actually now that I think about it, I can talk about that.
[03:11:54] We can put together a little something.
[03:11:56] Psychological warfare.
[03:11:57] If you got little moments of weakness you want to overcome, I can talk to you personally about
[03:12:02] that through your iPhones.
[03:12:04] Google Play iTunes.
[03:12:06] This is an MP3.
[03:12:07] Through your Android.
[03:12:08] I don't want to leave you all out.
[03:12:09] Through your Samsung.
[03:12:10] Right?
[03:12:11] Sure.
[03:12:12] Equal Opportunity Platform.
[03:12:14] Device.
[03:12:15] Devices.
[03:12:16] In every scenario.
[03:12:17] Let's say.
[03:12:18] Yeah.
[03:12:19] And also you can get that chocolate white day.
[03:12:22] I'm on that train too.
[03:12:23] There's a lot of trains in the chocolate situation.
[03:12:27] It's supplementation situation.
[03:12:29] It's been hot.
[03:12:31] Yeah.
[03:12:32] And while when it was hot up in Maine at the camp, how good did that tea taste?
[03:12:36] Legend.
[03:12:37] Because it had it.
[03:12:38] It was really good.
[03:12:39] It was really good.
[03:12:40] It was really good.
[03:12:41] It was really good.
[03:12:42] It was crazy.
[03:12:43] So yeah.
[03:12:44] She was always super scary.
[03:12:46] She was very cool.
[03:12:47] Afterdish became dr świat.
[03:12:48] Right?
[03:12:49] Because he could pack it up, or at least he had it begun.
[03:12:52] I wanted to know.
[03:12:53] Okay.
[03:12:54] But even though it broke down,
[03:12:55] when it struck new light.
[03:12:56] It dropped into half of the lights,
[03:12:59] the light absorbed the light on the back of the mic.
[03:13:01] Yeah.
[03:13:02] Apply beeps and light on top of the light.
[03:13:04] You're low-grade.
[03:13:05] At all that was the light for the lights.
[03:13:07] It's not a nice watch around you.
[03:13:06] And don't worry, your difference is over.
[03:13:10] For a for a for a chance to see.
[03:13:11] As it seems to work.
[03:13:12] I didn't really expect it.
[03:13:13] I'll come for it.
[03:13:14] I'll install it.
[03:13:15] Okay, so then I also got some books.
[03:13:17] We got the way into Warrior Kid and Mark's mission.
[03:13:21] This is for kids.
[03:13:22] Between the ages of four and 84.
[03:13:25] Because everybody can get something.
[03:13:28] Yeah, you got life's five year old fired up about getting the job.
[03:13:35] By the way.
[03:13:36] No.
[03:13:37] Yeah, in the second book, Mark, who's the young character,
[03:13:39] and the book wants to get, wants to get a new bike.
[03:13:42] But he needs money in order to get money.
[03:13:44] Guess what you need.
[03:13:45] You need a job, son.
[03:13:46] You need a job, or sell some stuff.
[03:13:48] Or sell some stuff.
[03:13:49] All right, job and sell.
[03:13:50] Or that's what he has to do.
[03:13:52] So yeah, if you want to give your kids a good book,
[03:13:55] that will teach them about discipline, hard work.
[03:13:59] Being kind.
[03:14:01] Yeah.
[03:14:02] But the dichotomy of being strong.
[03:14:05] It's all in there.
[03:14:06] Yeah, man.
[03:14:07] And it's all in there.
[03:14:08] You're late.
[03:14:09] You explain it while you Uncle Jake.
[03:14:11] Whoever one of you guys, it's good how you explain it
[03:14:16] in real simple terms.
[03:14:17] And then you get this kid Mark, especially in the sub talk
[03:14:20] about the second one.
[03:14:21] Right now where he's like, he kind of,
[03:14:23] he overcomes them stuff.
[03:14:24] He's super strong right now.
[03:14:26] But still a lot to learn.
[03:14:27] So he understands it.
[03:14:28] And then at first he's questioning it.
[03:14:30] Then he starts to understand.
[03:14:32] Any questions?
[03:14:32] Then he understands.
[03:14:33] Then he's fired up about doing it.
[03:14:35] I mean, because he gets, but it's really good.
[03:14:37] And that's literally how like the kid, whoever you're reading
[03:14:39] in my case, really read into my daughter.
[03:14:41] She's fired up.
[03:14:42] And I watch her getting just as fired up as Mark.
[03:14:45] He's like, oh, my gosh.
[03:14:46] She's like, oh my gosh.
[03:14:47] Yeah.
[03:14:48] No, she gets fired up.
[03:14:49] Pretty good, man.
[03:14:50] Really, it's interesting to see the little transition.
[03:14:53] Yeah, I forget so much good feedback.
[03:14:55] Anyways, that's that way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
[03:14:58] Also the Dispunnyckels Freedom Field Manual, which is solid,
[03:15:03] which is solid.
[03:15:04] It's a good daily reminder.
[03:15:07] It's not, you don't need to read that whole book every day.
[03:15:10] You can read one.
[03:15:11] You can read three pages and you can get yourself, you know, you might have been
[03:15:14] very often path of like, get yourself right back on the path.
[03:15:17] Yeah.
[03:15:18] It's a good thing to read.
[03:15:19] You could like read that, but read it.
[03:15:21] A page two pages three pages every day.
[03:15:23] It will, would you, I would say this.
[03:15:26] It will absolutely help you if you read three pages a day.
[03:15:29] Yeah.
[03:15:30] That's a bold statement too.
[03:15:31] I'm saying this book, a book.
[03:15:33] This is not, this is not an exercise program.
[03:15:36] This is an supplement that you take.
[03:15:38] This is not, this is not a treatment that you get.
[03:15:40] This is a book pages in a book.
[03:15:42] If you read them, it's going to help you.
[03:15:44] Yeah.
[03:15:45] That's, that's what my statement is.
[03:15:46] And I believe it's, be true.
[03:15:47] Why?
[03:15:48] Because I read it.
[03:15:49] I wrote the damn thing.
[03:15:50] And I still read it.
[03:15:51] And it's helping.
[03:15:52] And then we got extreme ownership, which is combat leadership, a run with my brother,
[03:15:57] Lave Babin.

[03:16:03] life.
[03:16:04] And the follow on book to that.
[03:16:06] The dichotomy of leadership, which I mentioned the word dichotomy quite a bit, Dean
[03:16:10] Lister says it's my favorite word.
[03:16:12] I'm not so sure it's my favorite word.
[03:16:15] I think my favorite word is discipline, but I don't know if I have a favorite word.
[03:16:21] Anyways, I do talk about the dichotomy a lot because the dichotomy is present in everything
[03:16:26] that we do.
