If you want to get yourself to a position, like, my, my, my, my, my, it seems to me that you're making a distinction between discipline and strategy, like, you know, and, and, and, and, and, like, impulsive moral responding, you know, like, let's say that you are in a situation where you have a boss who's intolerable, and maybe what you'd like to do, you know, the resentment has built up over five years, and you'd like to go in there and, and yell at him and tell him everything you think. They were ordinary men, and they were brought, and they had a commander who had made an explicit case that if they weren't able to tolerate the conditions in Poland that they could go home, so there was no top down order that you had to do this or else, and then they were, you know, first of all, they started rounding up, well, mostly Jewish people men between 18 and 65, and then, you know, they started to participate in the entire atrocious mess, and they were, they ended up many of them taking naked pregnant women out into fields and shooting them in the back of the head, and what the author does is outline how that happens to you, you know, one step at a time, and so it's a really horrifying book, and it's a brilliant book, because there's no attempt to make the perpetrators like some creatures that aren't human, like just pure psychopaths, and of course, in a situation like Nazi Germany, and in the horrors of the communist states, there was no shortage of places for psychopaths to prevail, but that's not really the issue. Like those guys, they're people, and I think that key thing of reading it and going, man, every single person, like when you read about these, you're talking about millions of people that were tortured, died, murdered, every one of those people, key word as people, every one of those people is a person, and to your point, every single one of those executioners, every single one of those murders, is also a person. I watched one of their videos yesterday and it's kind of an older one too, but it made me like love origin even more because it's like you'll see you know the people that make up and all the ladies there and then pee like he has like longer hair and stuff like that. Well, it is, there is this like it's like, you know, if there's something satanic at the bottom of this, you know, mythologically speaking, there's also something that's like a cosmic, it's like cosmic black humor. And you know, like you can imagine that, you can imagine a dark night, you can imagine the winter, you can imagine the alcohol, you can imagine the rage that fuels these people who are drinking too much in the pubs that have been sitting there for the last 20 years like what would you say eating up their own souls with resentment and bitterness and then someone comes in and says you're the true victim here and here's the people that you can go after. And that was, so when I was talking to this group, and I'm getting, and I said to them, I said, you're looking at me like, right now, like, I'm like, I don't know what I'm talking about. And what socializing it's indeed was scour his conscience and try to put himself together, partly because he was shamed, he was a shamed of himself in the face of these extraordinarily extraordinary people who seem to be able to keep their moral compass under circumstances where no one should ever assume that they would keep their moral compass because certainly, like I said, when I was reading this the Gulag and other books like that, I never assumed that if I was in those situations that I would have been one of the people who kept their head and were able to withstand the temptation to become a trustee for example and to take things the easy way and to lured it over the other prisoners and to adopt that position of authority. Right, and so it's one of the greatest books written about what happened in the Second World War, I think, on the end of the atrocity end, because the author does such a lovely job of, well, it's a strange way of putting it in this context, but it's about this police battalion that was moved into Poland after the Germans went through and occupied the country, to establish order like police do, but also to participate in the mopping up, let's say, that was part and parcel of the war, and these were ordinary policemen, middle class guys, most of whom had been educated and socialized before the Nazi propaganda machine really got rolling, so they weren't like Hitler, youth types. and I guess you're, that's what I was trying to say with when we started this conversation, I was trying to say that it's like you're watching this, like like you said, it's like a bad comedy movie. If you don't know what echo Charles looks like or if you don't know what I look like, you can watch the YouTube channel. I mean, he was a very weird, mystical sort of person, you know, and he made claims or some of his characters to it, but on his behalf that, you know, not only are you responsible for everything you do, but in some sense you're responsible for everything that everyone else does too, and you know, obviously there's a way in which that isn't true. So while you were going through that, I was thinking myself, so I was talking to I still talk to military folks, and I was talking to some military leaders young leaders, so like platoon level and company level leaders, so these are guys that are in charge of, you know, 40 guys or maybe 150 guys. Again, just going back to this idea of what you get out of reading, because people ask me to ask me to, because I read books all the time on my podcast, and what you just said, it struck me as something that's... People have told me, I read that book before, but I didn't really get out of it, what you got out of it, and when I heard you read it, I was saying, how did I... And you can see what people look like if you don't know what Jordan B. Peterson looks like. It's like the whole, the whole book and the whole Soviet Union, when you read about it now, it seems like it seems like a bad joke. And yet, that's not only did it happen, there was like a contest to top the absurdity, you know, to, to, to consider the engineers, for example, records is, well, these people were building the, so the, it's system to the degree that it was built, and then to turn around and accuse exactly those people of being the ones who destroy and undermine it. Okay, so imagine you get a village, and now there's a bit of a socioeconomic pyramid, and there's some people that are doing well, and they're really, and there are, and it isn't the crooked people that are really annoying, though people who, like the genuine cool acts, let's say that that small percentage of psychopathic types who were basically profiting criminally off the efforts of others. But when you pick it up, it's like, it's like, when you pick up your friend, you know, or your kid freaking in the way 70 pounds. You probably, I'm assuming you don't either, maybe you do, I don't know, but when Pete posts little like videos of the close, you know, close up of the buttons, the jeans. And then the next question is, well, what does it mean about how you should conduct your life, and one of the things that, I mean, I think what happened to me when I read all this material in the 80s was that I became convinced that there wasn't anything more important to do in the aftermath of what had happened in the 20th century, than to try to build people who were responsible enough as truth-telling courageous, responsible citizens, so that the probability would increase that if they were in a position to make a terrible choice that they would make the right one, and I would say this lecture tour that I'm doing, which is now extended over more than 100 cities, is an extension of the same thing. You know, you think about the rape, for example, or just the theft or but it's the rape that you can really think about as as absolute revenge for all that bitter resentment all fueled by the fact that, you know, you'd sat there for the last 20 years being completely goddamn useless and bitter hatred and angry and and and and fantasizing about the day that would come where you'd have your opportunity. If now, I guess it's easy to look from the outside and say, hey, if I was in this prison camp, my gut instinct is like, okay, jok, or you know, you've been through these kind of things before, play the game. Yeah, I feel like it's like origin denim they make it, you know. You know, it's like, one of those, like, that's not good.
