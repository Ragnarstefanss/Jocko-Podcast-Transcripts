And I'm like this is awesome the two you do it in like in reprisal to me are The the cop you do that but in like revenge like if you get to like all right, sir I'm like content You're in my you're in the wrong neighborhood today. You know The instructors representative are as well self as they're trying to press you so we sign a contract Sign a contract is okay, but if you believe in and the instructor you'd like what you saying you like the environment because then as a visitor You're gonna see like this person not trying to sell me something you can see how they actually are and if you hear what they're saying It's making sense to you and you you vibe with the energy or let's say the style or the personality of the The instructor go to all five gyms in this and pay the day fee 20 30 bucks and try and then come back Which which one did you like best and then try it out and yes Jesus awesome because Also you're not getting hit the head. Yeah, like it's like making my mind like Pro solve problems rather than like be all you know you have little micro reaction the inside internally I mean I'm not bad. I'm not really for some reason Me and Corop don't talk so much anymore but he was the resident Grappling guy slash coach training partner so I arrived and I'm like I'm kind of like the new guy like a This dude that he looks at me and there was that little bit of like okay, this is the new guy. and when this is like a transition I had a Like an energy type drink the other day and because I was driving and I needed a little energy and it was like one of those ones And it said you know like all the all the little buzzwords on it healthy natural blah Charles game and she got ready and about to leave and the guy said hey listen You know I like you like spend time with you, but I'm just saying I Had my own expectations and you know I don't really want to be with a girl who goes out all the time with a girl Friends, I mean how a good time go have a good time. but I was kind of like waxed days ago like always close I went hey echo here's my arm and usually he's like there's something wrong like it's there's a trap Usually there's a trap. and I feel like I'm a like whatever I was like it's like so if you lose I lose also I'm a strong swimmer, I'm not, he was like, you know, like, flipers, you know, I flipers like, I thought he did. You know like Jocco said I mean there's been some rough times and That's some some some unique things that I'd been through and you know That's how you know you have a little bro's real team stick by my side and you know help me actually You know if I can help them as well. and He afterwards he was like, you know, he was cool to watch you roll because First of all, like it didn't even look like Anything I've been training right because you guys are just getting crazy and he goes Okay on it calm flash jockel this is where you can get your kettlebells I got some heat for calling them artistic kettlebell actually wasn't called them that for Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't he it was like an inch or an offering what are Just to get a little like primal bells the ones that look like faces on them But you know I noticed it's a beautiful bro, you know you know in Japan and Russia Brazil whatever Caratia in any country you can imagine I've been to for some reason I'm I'm by far like not a Criminal or something like that but for some reason you get you get a lot of these Gangster mafia type guys that are fans and you end up hanging out these guys and happen to Russia or like an a movie theater like I'm sitting next to you ready I like that range just my style you know No, I roll you were meant for that you were meant for that do you what do you think about when you see All the for locks that's become such a huge focus the game I remember one day you came in everyone cheered for you because it's the first You know you were like you're maybe like when I face she's like my shadow and the superfight and you know like well their foot hit hit Hammer something like that you get on so where you like we get it move That's why I was that's if you're drinking Because I know it like tea if you drink tea, but if it was just if it was just like you in a store in grab the can you open You be like It's not cool and he also do the I'll do it to all start I'll like the fire you know like like and we don't you know, that's just kind of our attitude Here's a quick story jockel you would appreciate it and I'm not gonna say his name because you know Been training here for a few years nice nice guy Actually came through me and said hey Dean I want you know I really like training with you or my coach It's always It's really interesting very Great man I used to just spam his phone up I send like videos and or pictures And one of the funniest things you used to like you didn't do this like yeah, but I really know how like through the day you'll get you know How to get tested things won't go your way or whatever I felt like oh man. He's two by the way and I think he thought it was like a for real milk Like a dessert and he's like yeah, so this may be like a week or two into due to Right even then right when we locked up I knew okay that there is zero chance of me beating Dean Yeah, or that's maybe when Dave Burk came on and we were talking about top gun and how like He he he said it up really nice thing. He was like the next day Yeah, or like in the like yeah, you know military police firefighters border patrol paramedics other first responders We know that all of you makes sacrifices every day to protect us and we Absolutely thank you for that and like Dean I also hope that all you and all those jobs Find some time to train some jujitsu Because it'll make you better at your job, but it'll make you better at life and if you can't find jujitsu Find some boxing or some judo or some resting or some mojitai or Some way to train so that you can fight when the time comes And and really that goes to everyone that is listening to this If you can get out there fight Like I was wondering what's up with that because if you're super competitive in training you'll pull that kind of stuff Like jacquette now Pull not he won't cheat like that, but jacquette is a little more stingy selfish Yeah that guy You know the first time I trained with him at crowcops gym Chrome has a gym under his house is full gym with a case Sasha ways That 230 probably dude he's got a ways in that his head I've knack on the size of this table five foot but it's five foot nine ten, you know and he has real good hands That guy's hardcore he was what's up with his head and his Come on, he was like and I was like what do you mean he's like you normally just look like The same all the time Well, I Okay, I was a seal Whereas maybe a 19 year old kid who wants to be a seal will be like I'm gonna be as you know He's gonna say it and a young fighter or Or someone wants to be a fighter to be like And I was like, and so again, you tell me if this is insecurity, but I was like, I never want to have another man be able to impose his will on me like that. So by the way Stuff to that Mental note I don't know you know these themes I have like I Just finished with All for Venezuela like I yeah, you are my U.S. fighter you get a really established fighter is not Not gonna usually say I'm a fighter I break those arms and not use that way also Some of the richest people I know you wouldn't know the rich because But I've met girls diddy girls who they have one nice dress Their pores hell, but they look they look like their rich when they're going out They're trying really hard to look rich, Three quarters, yeah, it was like, you know, whether maybe at the beach by the house is with, you know, both I don't know, or my own branch, yeah.

So I'm like, Joc, how much did you lose you mother, you know, I think I was like three quarters of, I think I think I actually read the stuff. I just, I look like, like, from a damn horror movie, like, with the real one. Sounds like, sounds like something sounds like I'm making them up. It's actually a lot of times when you teach moves you're like this is a move that you would only do to someone that's Very good friend of yours or someone that you hate Yeah, which is really kind of jacked up if you think about it like I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, mental note. And I'm like, I'm just like, I'm like a shame. I think you just you know a higher understanding about that the the Confrontational A few my bees I've talked about how when you blow with someone you've never rolled with before you meet someone And as soon as you make contact with them as soon as you clinch up with them you can tell what's up You can you can kind of tell Like okay, this is gonna be this guy knows what he's doing this because this person doesn't really know Or they're okay or wait a second you right before the match because we were trained for like three weeks You know and a pretty old right before match because he didn't want to talk to you He said in English section he went just so you know I came down here to help you and If you don't win today, I've let you down Yes, I might my dad would kind of like how you raised the war like you know you're gonna do this yeah Go like it's fine because we know what we do here and Other gyms it's like
