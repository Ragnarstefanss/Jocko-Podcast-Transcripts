00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000 This is Jockelfondcast number 261 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:24.000 Being in the teams is the best job in the world. Probably heard me say that before, the best job in the world. Why do I say that?
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:45.000 Well, first of all, the job itself, which consists of shooting machine guns, jumping out of airplanes, blowing things up, scuba diving, running around in the woods. It's just a freaking awesome job.
00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:04.000 So, so you got that. On top of that, you got this mission, the mission that you're focused on, you're on a mission to protect America, to protect democracy, to protect freedom, to protect people.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:30.000 And in order to do that, kill bad guys. Because you're supposed to do all that protecting, in order to do all that protecting, you got to kill bad guys, which, which has a kid and really as a man for that matter, that's what me and my friends always wanted to do. And I'm sorry if that doesn't sit right with you.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000 Or if you think I'm some kind of a monster because of it, but that, that's the reality.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:54.000 So that's another reason why the job is awesome. But the last thing and certainly not the least thing, in fact, the best thing about the job, by far, is the boys.
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.000 The guys you get to work with. They're, they're awesome. And contrary to popular belief, there's no cookie cutter format that represents a guy in the field teams.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000 Your guys coming all shapes and sizes, they come from all different backgrounds.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000 And it should be noted that not all of them are good guys. There are some knuckleheads for sure. There's some ego maniacs. There's some guys that really aren't part of the team.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000 There's some guys that look out for themselves. There's guys that don't help out. There's some guys that don't care about the mission.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000 There's guys that put themselves above the team.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000 So there's, there's some of those types running around. And that's true in any organization. But as a whole,
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000 the boys are pretty legit. There are working, they're tough. They put the team first.
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000 They get the mission done.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000 They have fun while they're doing it. And you can count them on them.
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000 Which is an underrated thing, right? You can count on them.
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000 And I was lucky enough to work with a ton of those guys during my career.
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000 I was leaving Ramadi. So at the end of my last appointment, and I was leaving Ramadi and another task unit came in to take our place.
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:37.000 And they were coming into a complete and utter firestorm of sustained combat.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000 And look, we had all been deploying a bunch over the years since 9 to 11. And this was 2006.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000 Sort of the end of 2006. And so guys knew what it was like to go on combat deployments.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000 But this particular combat deployment that we had been on in the Battle of Ramadi was significant. We had a lot of casualties.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000 And these guys that were coming to replace us.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000 I mean, I knew that they were coming into something that Seals hadn't deployed into in a long time.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000 And look, I'm not saying that Seals weren't deploying into dangerous places. They were, but kind of a known scenario like that.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000 It'd been a while.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000 And so I felt horrible, actually. I felt horrible for the new task unit that was showing up to replace us.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000 Because I felt like we had learned so much there. We had gotten good at our jobs.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000 And I felt like we were leaving this other task unit in a bad spot.
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000 And I was worried about them and worried how they would survive.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000 Well, I knew a few of their guys.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000 A few of their guys I knew. And that gave me a level of comfort.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000 One of the guys that I knew was the senior enlisted guy of the task unit, the guy named Steve Ward.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000 One of the good guys. And I kind of knew him tangently over the years.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000 Because I had turned over with him in Baghdad a couple years earlier.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000 He'd been in a leadership position in a platoon at Team 5 and run a bunch of operations and done a great job.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000 And I'd gotten a solid turn over from him. So that was awesome.
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000 And it just made my comfort level go up that someone was coming in.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000 That was humble enough to listen and learn not just from me, not just from task unit bruiser, but also from the army in the Marine Corps.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:10.000 And who is also smart enough and knowledgeable enough to mix in that knowledge and that experience with humility and make sense of the whole crazy situation.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000 Which is what he did. And when Steve came back from that deployment, which was a hard deployment for them, we ended up working together.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000 Actually, actually truly working together for the first time at trade at the training command.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000 He took over the land warfare, training cell as the senior enlisted advisor in that training block.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:44.000 And we ended up spending a lot of time together training and preparing seals for combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000 And it was a...
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000 It's hard for me to even say it was a challenging job. Yeah, it was a challenging job.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000 But it was so critical and it was so rewarding to be able to work with the young frogmen and pass on the lessons learned to the next generation.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000 So that they could go out there and take the fight to the enemy and keep themselves safe as safe as they possibly could.
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:31.000 And I've actually retired out of that job and Steve carried on in his career. You went on to more senior positions of leadership and continued to deploy over and over again in support of the war on terror.
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000 Until a few months ago when he finally retired.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000 And since then, we've been working together again. Still...
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000 ...still actually training leaders this time for leadership in the business world. But we're back at it.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000 And it is an honor to be working with Steve again. And it is an honor to have Steve here on the podcast to tell us about his life, his experiences, and his lessons learned.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Steve, thanks for coming all, man.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000 Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it, Juggle.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000 You were one of the guys in the beginning when this podcast kind of kicked off that was given me reports from the field that you were in the game listening to it.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000 Yeah, me and Gardner go on back and forth. You know, in some of the books you covered early on, like the last hundred yards, and I was like damn.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000 How could you not get on the net and listen to that for a couple hours? So that was good.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000 Yeah, and here you are sitting in the chair. Let's go. Let's rock and roll. Let's talk about where Steve word came from.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:45.000 Yep. So group in Sacramento, California, small town. My mom and dad were divorced. So I'd go see my dad in the summer months and my sister and my mom and I, we all grouped the other Sacramento.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000 I graduated high school in 91.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000 Would you slow your roll, bro?
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Yeah, so we got a list of cover.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000 Come on.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000 So would you let your mom do? Would your mom do for 11?
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000 So she worked at a Davis college. She was like an administrator there.
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000 And then what about your dad? Where was your dad? So my dad, he was an air traffic controller. So we kind of bounced around the US.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000 It's been a lot of time and floor to Puerto Rico up in Washington.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000 Did you see much of your dad growing up?
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000 Yeah, in the summertime, I mean, my sister gone and see him for anywhere from two weeks to 30 days in the time.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 So it's good.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000 Well, so it's good.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000 So you just breeze through like, oh, when Ty is going to graduate, you were about to be in the Navy.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Well, we did play sports.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 Yes.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 So played a baseball soccer football coming up.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000 Any good? I'd say I was an average athlete.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000 Nothing special.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000 I wasn't consistent. I had good. Like for baseball, I had times and I was doing good.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000 And then I'd get in the slump and when do so good.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000 Slump due to bad attitude.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000 Slump from, I'm trying to think of a good way to work this here.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Slump from up. I guess being good enough.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000 You know, like you get, so I was a pitcher. I played baseball. I played pitcher and I played outfield.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000 And I'd have some times where I'd get up there and, you know, my friends would be cracking jokes.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000 I mean, you're going to be in the first batter. You're going to be in the first batter.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000 You're going to be in the first batter. First pitch. I'm being the first batter.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000 Like damn. You know, you can't crack.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 Crack jokes up on the mound because you just hit somebody with a baseball.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000 So, you know, didn't pan out too good for me. So my junior, I kind of quit baseball.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000 And my freshman year, I started playing football. And I really enjoyed football.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000 Contacts sport. Hard. Like a lot of hard work goes into that.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000 So I enjoyed football. Finish that up my senior year. I played all four years.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000 And soccer. I kind of quit playing that when I was probably like around 13, 14 years old.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000 What kind of what were your friends doing when you weren't playing sports?
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000 Get in trouble. Get in trouble. So sports.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000 You know, I was probably like, I wouldn't say a bad kid, but I was definitely off the path.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000 7th, 8th and 9th grade. Not good thanks for me.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000 You know, I got, I was picking up trash on the side of the road. Those are on probation. Just doing stupid shit.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000 For what? Just nothing. I cared for Peter.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000 Just, uh, what do they call that? Delinquent. Delinquents.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000 I was a delinquent. And it wasn't my friends. It was me.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000 I was a guy that was like, one of the, when my friends came around, I was the guy instigating and kind of leading the charge on doing.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000 What kind of music were you listening to?
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000 I just whatever. Like country rap rock I did, my just didn't matter.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000 We had the old AMFM rados or anything. That's going on. There's a different time.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000 Yeah. You were limited to what you could actually hear. Yeah. Was it a small town?
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000 Um, yeah. So I grew up actually in West Side.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000 I was definitely a small town. Okay.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000 So, yeah, small town, smaller high school.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000 I went to high school called River City. Um, that was small.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000 Did they have wrestling there?
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000 They had, they started a wrestling program. I think when I was in about 10th grade there.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000 I didn't, I didn't wrestle. I played football. I stayed away from basketball.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000 Um, yeah.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000 How was your grades? I'm really a convention.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000 Not good. Not, they were not good. I passed high school by the, you know, barely passed high school.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000 So it wasn't good for me. I didn't pay attention. Had good teachers always given you good advice.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000 I was just not in the learning.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000 So you were a little bit of a trouble maker, right?
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000 Do you think when you were being a trouble maker?
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 Do you think you were doing it for attention? Do you think you were doing it for the thrill?
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Do you think you were doing it for adrenaline? Like why do you think you were doing it?
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000 I think when I was a, which I was, I think of a lot of it.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000 What I was doing to sort of prove to myself and my friends that I was like, uh, uh,
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000 tough like type things. Like I don't care. I'll do this like that kind of thing.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000 When I think back as to why I did dumb shit, which I did plenty of,
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000 I think that's why a lot of it was like to prove that I was a quote and I'm putting in big air quotes here,
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000 tough because the stuff I was doing was by no stretch of the imagination, tough.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000 Yep. I'd say I fallen that same category trying to prove something just doing,
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000 and I got our journal journal and rush out of doing those dumb things.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000 And it took a long time to get out of my system.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000 So you said that was mostly six, seven, eight, ninth grade, seven, eighth and ninth.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000 Yeah. By tenth grade, were you kind of a little bit more square to, uh, turn in the corner?
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000 Yes. Yep. Did you feel, did you have some runs with a law that kind of straightened you back out?
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000 Provation and picking up trash on the side of the road.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Hmm. Kind of scored me where we'll get away with a little more interest.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000 You're in the van with all the rest of the delinquents.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000 You're on the road on Saturday and Sundays. Not a good situation.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000 So then you graduate, you barely graduate high school.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000 At what point did you think about joining the Navy or did you think about the joining the Marine Corps or the Army?
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000 Where did you, what was the situation with and listing in the military?
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000 So I remember one of my high school teachers told me, hey, you got three choices when you get out of high school.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000 And he's kind of mentoring us and none of us know it at the time, but he's like, hey, you can go to college,
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000 which I highly recommend, you can get a job or you can join the military.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000 Or you can do a company that's not going to be a good job.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000 You can get a job or you can join the military. Or you can do a combination of one and two.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000 And that kind of always stuck with me.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000 You know, and then as I started going in college, like, man, I just, I don't want to learn.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000 I wasn't ready to learn.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000 Wait a second. So you just skipped right to your in college.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000 So when you, when you're still in high school, you didn't join the Navy or join the military while you're in high school.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Correct. He gave you the three options.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000 Job, college, military, you chose college.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000 Yes. First.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Yep.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000 You thought, all right, did you have any freaking vision of any kind whatsoever you just like know sign up for whatever classes they signed me up for?
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 Yeah. So I just signed up for the basic general education stuff.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 You know, went for a full semester and then dove into the second semester.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000 And that's where like a one point. I don't know how to recruit or wound up at our door, but the recruit or wound up on our doorstep.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000 And I started talking to him and we used to do a step of what your house of the house.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000 You know, you go through and I was like, yeah, this is something I think I might be in a rescue map.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000 Your mom called the dam recruiter in Santa Monica.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000 Oh, she was kicking him out of there.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000 Oh, really? She was not having any other recruiter. She told him to get that out of here.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000 Oh, he did.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000 Was your mom a hippie or something?
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 No, no. She's a farm girl. She grew a farm.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000 Yeah, she just didn't. She didn't want me join the military.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000 Hmm.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000 But you talked to him.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000 I talked to him and was he a Navy recruiter?
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000 Navy guy. Yep.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000 Navy recruiter.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000 Did you have any inklet? Did you have any parents, grandparents? Anything about the military?
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000 Yep. You so stood?
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Yes.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000 So my grandfather was in the army and he was he never went.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000 He was around the World War Two, but he never went and served.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000 You know, he got stationed out in Alaska somewhere.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000 And then my dad was in the Air Force.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000 So I had some small touch points there with some cool stories of, you know, grandfather being in the military.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000 He was talking about throwing his grenade in the sergeant was telling that was the best throw ever type thing.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000 And then my dad was in the Air Force.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000 Your grandfather was getting told you're going to beam the batter with that grenade.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 Yeah.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 Yeah.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000 So then so the guy took the recruiter talks to you.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000 And at this point, you realize college is like the waste of your time.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000 Yes.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000 I'm done with school in the school.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000 How did you enjoy high school?
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 And I definitely wasn't enjoying college at that point.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000 Which college was it?
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000 I was just called Saxity Community College.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000 So you're living at home during this time?
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000 Yes.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.000 Yeah.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000 Living at home working part time going to college.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000 What was your part time job?
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000 I mean, I don't remember what it was.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000 I had a couple of jobs growing up.
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000 I worked in a bunch of different little restaurants being a bus boy being a dishwasher,
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 a booth furniture with a guy named Craig is great family guy.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And so we get on the road.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000 You work for a light furniture.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000 We'd be trucking on down Delle with furniture on the back of his big old eating wheeler.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000 I was actually a good job.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000 It was hard work, but a paid good money.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000 It was paying 10 bucks an hour back then.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000 That was good money.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000 You kind of the man with 10 bucks an hour.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000 It was the man with 10 bucks an hour.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000 Yeah.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000 And that was a lot better paid than the Navy paid you.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000 I'll tell you that back then.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000 So how did the Navy recruit or convince you?
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000 He was just like, hey, come in and give this a go, man.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000 And so I went through, did all that as a bad test.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000 And he's like, right, we can get you in in June timeframe.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 And what job were you signing up for?
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000 Because you didn't list.
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000 Did you know about the seals at this point?
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000 No, I didn't.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000 I never.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000 I didn't know what the seal was.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000 So I just, I was signing up to go to the regular Navy to go on a ship.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000 Day to figure life out.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000 Yep.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000 Little did I know.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000 It was about to get after some bathroom cleaning.
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000 So so what, like job that he sell you on.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000 He didn't sell me.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000 He was just like, I mean, so I had.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000 I grew up with some friends and they, you know, a lot of people are getting in trouble.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 People are doing drugs, all that kind of dumb stuff.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000 So I just knew I had the best option for me at that point in my life.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000 Was to get out of Sacramento and go try something different.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000 So the job, I, I didn't know what I wanted to do.
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Did you go to, did you go UD undesignated?
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000 Yes.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000 Oh, damn.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000 Yeah.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000 So I was in, you know.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000 So for people that don't know, like in the Navy, you have a job.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000 It's called your rating.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000 And your job is, you know, you might be a welder.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000 You might be a technician or an engine man that's going to work on engines.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 Or you might run a weapon system.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000 They have names for all these different jobs.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000 But if you don't have a job, they call it, and I remember this from bootcamp.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000 They was a threat.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000 They'd say, you keep this up.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000 You're going to go to the fleet UD undesignated.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 We mean you have no job, no skill.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000 You're just going to go in there.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000 So that threat that I got told was actually what you got signed up for.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000 Go to the fleet UD undesignated.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000 Sign me up already.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000 Roll.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000 Get me out of the sack.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000 Yeah.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000 Get me out of here.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000 So you rolled into bootcamp.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000 Yep.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000 Roll into bootcamp.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000 Fennish up.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000 I want to say right around October time frame.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000 So when did bootcamp win?
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 When did you go to bootcamp in July 1991?
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000 Okay.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000 And then did you go to Orlando?
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000 No, no.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Here in San Diego.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000 Oh, you went to San Diego.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000 That's right.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000 West Coast.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000 So you went to bootcamp.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 And you just went to bootcamp eight week.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000 It was eight weeks.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000 I think you had weeks.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000 You went to eight weeks of bootcamp.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000 And then to the fleet.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Oh, yeah, eight weeks of bootcamp.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000 Then I went to Seaman training.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000 Because I was going to work in Debt Department.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000 That was my own designating.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000 I'm going to be, you know, Seaman.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000 So got trained up for three weeks there.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000 And then showed up to a ship sometime.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000 And I think November December timeframe.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000 Of 91.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000 Bro.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000 Yeah.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000 Yeah.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000 Yeah.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000 Hey.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000 Jocco.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000 It's not that funny.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000 That's crazy, dude.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000 Yeah.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 Well, you must have done good on your ass.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000 Vabs.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000 That guy didn't try and make you into like whatever.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Some other rates we could get more.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000 No.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000 That's crazy.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Dude.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Well, that's in.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000 So that was probably my first lesson learned in life.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000 Hey, pay attention in school.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000 So you score good on your ass.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000 So you have option.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000 Right.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000 Hey, when you're in high school, you don't.
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000 I didn't.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000 I really thought about that.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000 I just need to make it through.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 Yeah.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000 In life, you're going to be given some test.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000 Well, you're going to go working a fire department, a police department.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000 You're going to go in the military.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000 And so the better edge educated you are, the more options you're going to have available to.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000 And I didn't do so good.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 So my options were limited.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Hey.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000 Yeah.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000 That's the one thing I always try and explain when like parents ask me about kids and like what the.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:21.000 And I think one of the biggest things you can do for a kid, the size getting them in a duty to is making them realize that their actions today have impact on the rest of their life.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000 We get little kids and when I say little kids, I'm talking me when I was 23, right?
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000 What I'm doing right now is going to impact where I'm going to be, right?
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000 And so you how can you expect a 13 year old or a 15 year old?
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000 And you know girls, I feel a little bit smarter than boys.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000 It's possible.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000 It seems judging from my own children.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000 Anyways, let me let me phrase X. I don't want to generalize in my personal family.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000 It seems like my daughters are a little better at connecting.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000 And what they're doing right now with the future than my son who just doesn't do it as much.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000 So yeah, that's a good point.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 And when you realize it, what I'm doing right now as a kid,
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000 and it's not just kids, what I'm doing right now is a human is going to impact away my life goes.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000 Yep.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000 And you might end up in the fleet, you do.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000 You do.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000 Get after it.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000 So so you do eight weeks of boot camp, three weeks of.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000 You know, you're going to be a prep school, you know,
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000 and then boom, you go to a ship.
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000 Yep.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000 What was that wake up call like?
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000 It wasn't bad.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000 It wasn't bad.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000 It was probably one of the best things that I've ever been to me.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000 Well, in what way?
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000 Yeah, I just, it was, it was a lot of hard work.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000 You know, so when you show up in Dr. Parvint and you're an E2,
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000 you're getting every, you know,
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000 you're getting all the assignments that are not fun to do.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000 You know, you're cleaning bathrooms, you're painting the ship,
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000 you're just doing all the things on ship maintenance.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000 And so you're eating some humble pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000 Why you're doing this?
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000 Give me a chance to kind of grow up a little bit.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000 It was good.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 It was hard work.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000 I'd roll the sleeves up and get dirty.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000 Yeah, you had time to reflect.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000 Yeah.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000 Time to reflect.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000 What were you thinking about when you were reflecting?
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000 I was, so when I'm reflecting on that,
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000 I'm just like, hey man, you can make the best out of this situation.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000 So I had one of my buddies that I went through boot camp with.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000 We wound up on the same ship, Chris, and me and him just always had competition.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000 We got put into the same deck department, and every assignment they gave us,
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 we're like, we're running up and down them, sterile with ladders, just a little day.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000 You know, completing assignments, coming back, like, hey, what else do you got from me?
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Like hey, you knuckleheads, that's supposed to take you to lunchtime.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000 We're like, well, we're done. Give us more.
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000 That's awesome, man.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000 So it was, it was fun. We made the best of it.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000 You know, and we had some good, some good leadership on the ship,
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000 and some bad leadership. You got to, that was my first exposure to kind of what right looks like.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000 What bad leadership looks like.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000 So it was good, and you're taking down all these data points, and you're stormed it in your head, you know.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000 And probably one of the biggest things I took out of that assignment is we had guys that were super knowledgeable,
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000 just very good. Like, we had a BM2, and he was super good at being a boesimate.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000 He knew everything, how to tie all the ropes, all the maintenance, he knew everything.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000 And he was square away, hard worker looked out for his guys.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000 Like, that's a dude I want to be like.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000 You know, he's talking about Esslime front, eight modeling, the correct behaviors.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000 That dude is modeling all the right behaviors.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000 Busted his ass, did good things, and he was getting promoted while he was on that ship.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000 So you're like, on that, that a point.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000 That's what right looks like. Same thing with the handful of chiefs around that ship.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000 Just good solid dudes. They weren't afraid to roll their sleeves up, get in there with the guys,
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000 and get to work.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000 You know, like, all right, check.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000 Mental note on that.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000 So then how long, how long was it when you were in the fleet until you heard about the deans?
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000 Yeah. So we had a couple guys that didn't make it through sil training.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000 They showed up, came friends with those guys at some point.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000 They told me all about, you know, basic underwater demolition sil training.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And I was like, damn, that's something I'm in and rest at in.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000 So I started training up, they told me kind of all the things you need to do to be successful.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000 They took me over to the obstacle court, course showed me all the tricks on how to navigate that thing,
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000 a lot of technique.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000 In the meantime, I was getting my application together and submit everything.
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000 So when I hit the two-year mark on the ship, I'd had my application back.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000 I was approved to go to a sealed training and everything was dialed in as tight as it could be.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000 No matter what I was going to have to do two years on that ship.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000 So you weren't even close to your two years yet, and you already had your application in?
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000 I would say I had it in right around the probably 13, 14 months cycle.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 So you owed whatever, whatever the month were.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 The other year or something like that, 10 months left.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000 Yep.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000 Yep, something like that before they'd release you.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000 Yeah, and the cool thing was, you know, we had two, my division master chief was an E9.
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000 Obviously he was a good dude and then our CMC or Command Master Chief of the ship was a good guy.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000 And they're like, hey man, you work hard, you stay out of trouble, we'll make some phone calls.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000 We'll make sure that you get a shot at going to Buds.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000 And they didn't have to do that, you know, they could have been like, hey, pack sand, Jack, you want to get off the ship.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000 Get out of the fleet and go to some other program.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000 That's not helping us out.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000 They didn't do that.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000 They looked out for me, you know, working hard, staying out of trouble, being a good person, all those three things were good.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000 You know, so again, it was kind of like reinforcing good behaviors.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000 So always be thankful to those guys.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000 And then the guys that showed up that had been to Buds, what kind of impression did that give you?
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 Did you?
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000 Because there's a weird thing that somehow you have to think that you can actually do it, right?
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 Yeah.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000 Or, you know, like, for me, I was like, I can do this, which is a really arrogant thing to think, right?
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000 It's arrogant to think most people quit, but I'm going to be able to do it.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Yeah.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000 I wouldn't sure where I was going to shake out on the whole thing beyond with the, I didn't like run long distance and grown up.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000 You know, we did a lot of sprints and football.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000 And I wasn't good with Polips.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 That's so Polips, I was, I definitely sucked at it.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000 And I was like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do the amount of Polips that are needed to do it.
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000 So I just started working hard on my Polips.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000 Got on a good running program.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000 Got on a good swimming program.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Those guys taught me how to do the sidestroke.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000 And so, you know, I just get up early morning and knock all this stuff out.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000 Going and either do a weightlifting program and then do my cardio at lunchtime or vice versa.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000 And every now and then those guys that come with me like a dial this and work on this.
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000 Look at that.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000 So I was, I was mentally and physically prepared for first face on what to expect.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000 These guys that give me so much information.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000 Did those guys talk about what happened to them?
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000 Yeah, so one of the two of the guys, one of the guys made a past hell week.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000 Another guy was in second phase and he got a drop for a full comp and then the other guy he was.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000 He got up right around the third week mark for a week mark in first phase and he got injured and he got rolled out.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000 Got a drop for pool comp and second phase up and then what did you see the other one was?
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000 The one guy made it past hell week and something happened when he was waiting a class up for second phase and they dropped them.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000 And then the third guy he made it I think to like week three or four.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000 And then got hurt or quit.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000 I think he, well, he said he got, so you know, no one ever quit.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000 Yeah.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000 Yeah, no one ever quit.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000 So you had a pretty good idea of what you're going into.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000 Yeah, because I can tell you I didn't have anybody that I didn't know anyone that went to seal training at all.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000 You know, because I was in the civilian world.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000 So for me, I didn't know what pool comp was.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000 I didn't understand anything.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000 It was just a blank open nothing and do nothing.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000 But you had a decent idea of what was going to be coming.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Yep.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000 Yep.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000 I could, I was physically and mentally prepared for first phase.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000 Did you get your pull-up square away?
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000 I did.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000 I actually went in a little better with my pull-ups and you know,
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000 the deal when you show up and you start classing up.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000 You're starting from scratch again.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000 So now you're, from where I came in, I was coming back down with,
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000 you know, my run times and swim times and all that stuff.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000 Meaning you were in better shape than what was required.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000 Yes.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000 Which is the way you freaking should try and get there.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.000 Yep.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Yep.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000 So you showed the buds.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000 Did you get what you expected?
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000 Yes.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000 Yeah, I was, feel as full benefit.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000 So it was good times.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000 Well, classroom unit.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 I was in 194.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000 So we start we classed up.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000 I want to say right around January of 1994.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000 What do you have the, do you have problems with anything?
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000 In buds?
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000 Yeah.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000 Oh yeah.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000 Yeah.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000 So first phase, first phase and third phase were,
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000 those came a lot more natural to me.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000 I grew up hunting and fishing and shooting guns and doing all that fun stuff.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000 So third phase wasn't bad. First phase I was mentally prepared for second phase.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000 I'd never scuba dive and never did any diving.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000 And for me, that was the hardest phase.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000 You know, actually filled a couple events in there.
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000 Like I filled pool comp the first go around.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 You know, then when I did my retest, I passed it and then like every little thing,
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000 you know, you're doing ditch and dawn.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000 You're doing all these little things with scuba tanks and going down and doing stuff.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000 I was jacking it all up.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000 And for me, my learning style, I really have to digest.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000 You know, what it is I need to do and kind of like visualize it.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000 And things were on a quick tempo for dive phase.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000 So it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't good for me.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000 Where did you feel like you're on the bubble the whole time?
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000 Like when I filled pool comp, I was like, all right, damn, I'm not going to make it through this man.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000 You know, you're on the wall of shame.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000 That doesn't help either you're looking at directional and jeez.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000 I filled pool comp too.
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000 Yeah.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000 I had our ops guy from train at our ops war and officer from train at, put me through.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Yeah.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000 Pool comp.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 Savage.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000 Yeah.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000 He just, well, you know what's crazy with pool comp?
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000 Like I'm going through and in my head, I had the procedures down.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000 And I thought I did good.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000 I'm like, I'm down there tying the wami knot, you know, all the shit.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000 And I'm like, I'm cool, I'm a collect.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000 I'm going through the procedures and the structure just yanks me up by the tank.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000 She's like, you failed.
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000 Get on the wall and I was like, damn seriously, like I'm going through trying to think of what I did wrong.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000 I'm like, I thought I was good, you know, but I didn't know if they were playing.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000 I didn't know if they were playing games with me or what, but I went over the wall and I was like, shit, I don't know if I'm going to make it.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000 That guy that failed me, who's a great guy.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000 But when he, he's same thing.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000 He had me down there.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000 I was down there.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Pool comp was 30 minutes when I went through and I know they showed that at some point to 20 minutes,
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000 but when I went through it was 30 minutes.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000 And he just, what he did was he just, he ripped my mask off and then he just started doing like a bob.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000 And he would bob down.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000 He would come down.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000 He would just knock the regular out of my mouth.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000 And then he'd go back up and I would grab the regular and I put it back in.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000 I'd clear it and then he'd knock it out again.
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000 And he did that for 19 minutes.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Damn.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000 And then I just kept replacing it and every one of those breaths was a nightmare because you're trying to,
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 I just got, got, got, got, get the water out of there, swallowing some of the water and then get a breath and then,
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000 and then boom, he'd knock it out again.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000 And you can't defend yourself.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 You can't protect yourself and you can't panic.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000 So I just kept doing it.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000 And then at 19 minutes he just comes down and gives me the thumbs up, come to the surface.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 And I come up and I'm like, I feel fine.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000 And he goes, he goes, you don't look comfortable down there. You fail.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000 And I was like, okay.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000 So I guess that's that.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000 Roger that.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.000 Yeah.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000 What's a whammy knot?
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000 Like they just tighten this complex knot.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000 It's like a multiple knot and we're not on that.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000 Okay. So it's not like a specific method allegeer.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000 Is it just like a generally speaking jam on that?
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000 So during this evolution called pool competency,
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000 also known as pool comp pool comp.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000 They want to make sure that you are beyond fully
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000 comfortable in the water.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000 You will not pass this if you're not comfortable in the water.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Zero percent chance.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000 So what they do is they they cause problems.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000 You have these old school scuba gear on like jaccoo stow style stuff.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000 No, they can be big hoses.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000 One hose goes in and one hose comes out.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000 And they're just like rubber hoses.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 And they start taking these things.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000 And they first they start off the knock off your mask.
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000 They rip off your fins.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000 They pull your regulator out.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000 And then they start pulling your regulator out.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000 And then like undoing your thing.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000 And eventually they pull it out and put it behind you.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000 Pull your regulator behind you and tie it.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000 And then not you got to take your gear off.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000 Pull the rig over your back.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000 Untie the knot.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000 Start breathing again.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000 Put everything back on in order.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000 Following the procedures.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000 As soon as you get it back on,
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000 boom they hit you again.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000 And so they keep doing this.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000 And eventually they give you what's called a whammy knot.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000 Which is a knot that you cannot get out.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000 You won't come out.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000 So now what you have to do is ditch your rig.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000 Which means you have to take it off.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000 You have to lay it on the bottom of the pool.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 You have to take your weight belt off and place it on top of the tank.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000 So they don't float.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 Then you have to kiss your your your kiss your manifold.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000 You kiss your manifold.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000 Oh no.
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000 You request permission to go up.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000 They give you permission.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000 You know, you give them a thumbs up.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000 They give you a like an okay thumbs up.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000 Then you kiss your manifold.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000 And then you blow and go to the surface.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000 And kiss your manifold.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000 You literally the part of the scuba tank is called the manifolds where the regulator kind of comes out of.
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000 You kiss that.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000 Like why?
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000 I don't get it.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000 Because those are the procedures.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000 So that's the deal.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Okay, like you got to follow these directions kind of kiss your manifold.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Right.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000 Did you have to kiss your manifolds?
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000 Yes.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000 So you kiss your manifold.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000 And then you blow and go.
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Which means you're not going to give yourself an air ambulism by the air expanding your lungs.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 And then you go to the surface.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000 You blow and go to the surface.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000 When you get to the surface, you give a thumbs up and you say, I feel fine.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000 And they either say, you know, good job.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000 You passed or they say, you looked uncomfortable with you failed.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000 Which for me, they said you looked uncomfortable with you failed.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 And then for Steve, they said you looked uncomfortable with you failed.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000 I would say the one thing that's different about me was I did good on everything else.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000 So when I failed, who compiles I called God?
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000 Like this is it.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000 I'm I'm going to fail super sketched out.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000 Yeah, not me.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000 That wasn't my first time failing.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000 So you like failed like getting down on and on.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000 Body breathe.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000 I was good on the buddy breathe.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000 Ditch and dawn and something else.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000 I don't know what else I felt.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000 It was like three things.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000 You know what I was like?
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000 My buddy breathe partner was a freakin' rest there from Iowa.
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000 He was a beast of a guy.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000 But he was a total freakin' panic in the water.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000 This dude would take the freakin' buddy breathe from me.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000 Cause you're using one set of scuba tanks.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000 He would take it and just breathe off of it for like a long time.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000 And then I'd be like, hey, you know, like giving a single leg.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000 I need that right now.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000 You know, and so he'd give it back to me.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000 And as soon as I took one breath, he'd be like, you know,
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000 give me the signal.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000 He needs more.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000 Hmm.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000 But you passed the second time.
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000 Yep, passed it.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000 Made it out.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000 Made it.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000 Made it in the third phase.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000 And then third phase was.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000 On eventful.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000 He's, you know, you're just doing a lot of run and swimming in shooting.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 So it was, that was a lot easier than second phase for me.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000 And running you were good.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 Running good.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 I had all my run times down before I went into Buds.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000 I wasn't so concerned about running.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000 I was just worried about kind of getting injured.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000 Slimming.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000 What about the open ocean swims?
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000 Good to go.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000 No factor.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000 No factor.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000 Did you, you are on her man?
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000 So I, so when you were firing the gut?
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000 Yeah, so the way they press it dude.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000 Yeah, the way they've worked it is I think we voted the fire
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 and the gut before the oner man results came out.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000 You know, the class voted that for me knows that card.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000 That's awesome.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000 And they're like, hey, Ward, you got oner man too.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000 And I was like, all right, check Roger that.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Well, well, well, well, the reason I say that's impressive is.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000 The oner man is usually somebody that's like it does really well in all the events,
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000 like running swimming.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000 Oh, of course.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000 And the fire and the gut is usually a guy that like doesn't.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000 Yeah.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000 It's a guy that had to kind of grill through it and go through it to pass.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000 Yeah.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000 Like in my class, it was Jeff Higgs, who had hypothermia multiple times,
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000 like five or six times and he just, he showed back up to buzz,
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000 even though they kicked him out, he showed up.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000 The class in his Dunga Rees and just kept doing it.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000 So he got firing gut, like of course.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000 And then oner man was Keith Cameroys, the total start athlete.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000 But for you to get both of those, that's pretty freaking.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000 Yeah.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000 So how did you even get that?
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000 I don't know.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000 I don't know man.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000 I don't know.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000 I didn't feel like it.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000 Were you one of the leading guys and were you an e4 at this point?
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000 So yeah, I'd made e4 off the ship before I went to buzz.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000 So I showed up the buzz and I was an e4 already.
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Were you the class leading petty officer?
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000 No, I was a second class nurse.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 No, we had a second class and there and I think eventually we had a,
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000 you know, he got the guy, our original LP, he got stress fractures and had real bad
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000 chance points.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000 So we got rolled on and another guy came in and now he took over the class
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 he'll be able to up.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000 So was he a week like for you?
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000 I'll tell you what, how week wasn't.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000 It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000 It sucks for everyone.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000 I had enough gas on my tank.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000 I think I could have went one more day.
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000 But you know, it was manageable.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000 Yeah, it was manageable.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000 We just had a guy on who ended up in SF,
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000 but he went to buzz and he didn't make it through buzz.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000 But he said buzz is really, really hard.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000 You know, he's like, it's because if you're thinking you're going to go there,
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000 you're going to get what you ask for.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000 For me, how week was kind of cool because I wasn't the best runner.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000 I wasn't the best runner.
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000 I wasn't the best swimmer.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000 And so it was like hard for me.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000 Like I had to put out super hard to pass those evolutions and I had the fear of
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000 failing.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000 Yeah.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000 And and and hell, you, there's no time limit on there's no time limit on the
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000 have illusions just keep going and I'm pretty good at keeping going.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000 That's, that's a, that's a good thing.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000 I'm good at just keep going no matter what.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000 The one thing I remember about how we get,
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000 you remember when we're doing steel pier.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000 And then we're doing the one of the coldest points I had in my life.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000 You know, they're a hose on the soft on that thing.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000 And it felt like my damn hip flexors were going to pop off.
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000 You're doing flutter kicks.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000 Then they'd pop us in the ocean and the ocean had to been around 60 degrees.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000 But the ocean was way warmer than still.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000 So you're in there and you're like, oh man, this is great.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000 Keep us in the ocean for a little longer.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000 You know, and they'd pop you back up there back and forth.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000 And I could barely walk when we got off of that damn, that damn pier.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000 So the peer evolution and how we was was horrible.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000 And then the instructors just wrenching down on that rope.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000 Carrying the boats to and from child that shit sucked.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000 You mean wrenching down on the rope so that the thing is pulling down on your head on your head.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000 Yes.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 Yeah, I thought my little neck was going to snap off there.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000 Were they jumping from boat to boat when you were?
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000 We had instructors in our boat.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000 I don't remember if jumping to another boat, but we were carrying them around.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000 The structures were jumping from boat to boat.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000 Damn.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000 And like I remember here in my freaking neck bones just grinding.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000 Yep.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000 No, I was like, this doesn't seem like it's good for me.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000 But, well.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Yeah.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000 So honor man and fire in the gut guy.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000 And of course you jack into team five and known cares about any of that.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000 No, it cares.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Like, hey, new guy.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000 Grab, go clean the shitter.
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000 He's like, damn, I thought I got away from the shitter.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 You're following me everywhere.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000 I jacked into team five.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000 Yep.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000 Chugging into team five and August 1994.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000 And then back then, you know, we started to go through STT.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000 So they pop you in a pitoon and you start doing your pitoon work up.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000 But you also got to detach from your pitoon and go through a seal tax.
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000 Oh, no kid.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000 So you're okay.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000 So, but your pitoon work up started.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 Our pitoon work up.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000 We, it was almost, we were a couple months before starting the work up.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000 But we were broken off and going to STT and the pitoon had just started some things when we had finished up.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000 And you went to the group STT didn't you?
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000 No team.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000 I think, you know, it's just the team.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000 Just to your team.
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000 Okay.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000 I thought they had already combined because eventually they combined.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000 Yep.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000 Where every guy went directly to a group.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000 Well, not directly, but everyone went through STT together for a while.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000 They still do now, but there was a time when they started.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 I thought they started around that time.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000 So with you, is just guys from team five?
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000 Yep.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000 Was it run by team five?
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000 It was run by team five.
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000 I'm trying to get out.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000 That's the same thing that I did.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000 And, and did you have any idea what your job was going to be?
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000 No.
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000 I got, you know, putting them at tune initially.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000 I was a, a dub guy in there.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000 I worked in there.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 The problem I had with a dub is I was left handed.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000 And we did one of our guys in training.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000 And he's like, hey, man, you're, they do to left handed.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Why do you guys have a shooting in a dub?
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000 Because you know, I all that rounds are the brass and the link.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000 Yeah, link are going out to the right, which is going right across your field of fire and then your face and stuff.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 So like, hey, put them on rear security.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000 So, got on rear security for that first battoon.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000 And then worked in there, dabble around and first attend it and ordinance.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000 What kind of platoon was it just a spec ops?
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000 Speaks back off, spoutin.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000 Yep.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.000 Yep.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000 So we were deploying out to a little island out there on the Pacific.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000 Did you, uh, how was, how was like your platoon leadership?
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000 No.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000 The first battoon was not, was not good.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000 So I got to see what wrong looks like.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000 You know, and it was kind of funny.
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000 Like our, uh, was a classic case of, you know, our, our OIC was, it was a good dude.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000 But I think it was two smart birds.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000 I don't get it.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000 And he, he was a little more concerned with PT and being a good shape.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000 And he was a phenomenal athlete.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000 Like, you know, one of them triathletes guys.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000 Mm-hmm.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000 But it came at the cost of showing up to dive evolutions on time.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000 Came at the cost of being a good tactical leader down on the ground, which is what everyone's,
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000 104.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000 Um, so I think he kind of lost, you know, a lot of our guys respect.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000 And he was kind of hardheaded, you know, and that classic,
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000 you know, I'm smart and everyone else type thing.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000 So it didn't go over good.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000 And it, it was just a, it was weird, you know, it was weird.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000 And I didn't realize how, you know, trying to find a good way to wear this.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000 It wasn't an ideal patoon.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000 You don't realize that until you get into a really good patoon.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000 Yeah, for you, you didn't know anything different.
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000 Of course, so for you, that's just the way a patoon was.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Yep.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000 And the scary thing about that is you get such a big impression made on you by your first
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000 patoon, that if you're not careful, you can think that other
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000 patoons are jacked up because they're not like your first patoon.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000 Yeah.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000 You know, you're so impressionable.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000 Yeah.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.000 Yeah.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000 So it was, it was an arresting.
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000 So there was a huge difference between my first patoon and third
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000 patoon, my third patoon I did.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000 We were like the best patoon of the team.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 And it felt good.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 Like the leadership was dialed in.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000 They were balanced out.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Harpatoon chief was squared away.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000 Well, respect it.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000 He was good.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000 Tactically he was good administrative.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000 That's the dude I want to be like.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000 You know, that was in your third patoon.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000 That was my third patoon.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000 You know, my second patoon was better than my first.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000 Still a lot of room for improvement.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000 You know, we, you were security.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000 Did you move a to point manner?
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000 Yeah.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000 Yeah.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 Move up to a point manner at some point.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000 I think my second patoon, the third patoon, I was running a point.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000 Running a point.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 Your tall for a point.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000 I know.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000 How tall are you?
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000 Yeah.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000 Six two.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000 Yeah.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000 And what were you, you know, just to give people a reminder, this is the 90s.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000 So we don't have a lot of assets.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000 Nope.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000 We don't have a lot of money.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000 Nope.
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000 We don't have.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000 We're not really doing any real missions.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Barely.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000 No.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000 You know, some guys like Gardner went to Somalia.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000 But that was a real rare occurrence.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000 Yeah.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000 So what we would do is train.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000 Get ready.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 Go on to point.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000 Kind of party.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000 Just kind of like what the scene was.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000 Yeah.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000 I was kind of funny because when I showed up to the team, Gardner was already in there.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000 He already had a couple of pothones on his bone.
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000 I'm on the damn quarter deck watch.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000 And this dude has a long maybe he's still in.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000 So I won't say his name.
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000 But he had a long name.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 And I'm like tension in the team five compound.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 Someone's so, you know, reports of the quarter deck.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000 And I've put your name.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000 What do you think's calling me on the damn before you go Gardner?
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000 He was a hard case man.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000 Hey, you have to new guy.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000 Say his name right.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 That's a shit man.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000 That's a friend.
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000 Yeah.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000 You're Gardner everything?
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000 Yeah.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000 He was.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000 I was like damn I'm not getting out of the compound tonight.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000 We don't get taped up and thrown in a damn mil van.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Yeah.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000 So, so this was ninety.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000 Yeah.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000 Because at that time.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000 Actually, yeah.
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000 At those years, you were starting to get a migration to team five from, like, for instance, from team one.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000 If people wanted to leave team one, if they didn't like the stall log.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000 And so there's a whole gang of guys that went down to team five.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000 I remember that to just get to have some freedom.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 No fun one.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000 Yeah.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000 They're all right down the street up.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000 They were coming on down the street north.
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000 Gardner was always at team five.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000 So he was, but he was just like, why would I want more, like,
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000 Why would I want to be over there with as a bunch of rules that you have to
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000 fought with?
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000 Yeah.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000 You can always find Gardner out when you're doing work into the desert.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 Because you just look for some smoke and look for fire.
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Look for fire.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000 There's Gardner.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000 He's a lights up shit on fire.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000 Gardner got.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000 So you do your third puttune.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 And then what?
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000 What are you thinking?
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000 What are you thinking about your life at that point?
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000 So what?
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000 What year is it?
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000 So this is I finished my third puttune in 99.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000 So I was going through a divorce at a kid and I was like, hey, I got to hit the
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000 reset button.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000 So I talked to our master.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000 I see him saying, I was like, hey, man, I can't even get you in here.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000 Be the training cell LPO and I was like, hey, man, I got a lot of baggage right now.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000 I need to break contact here, go reset.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000 So I got orders over to our special boat team and the headquarters element.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000 And I got put in there training cell.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000 We were basically setting up operational readiness exercises just like we used to
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000 run.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000 Yep.
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000 And so you went just to everyone understands you went from instead of being a team training cell,
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000 which you're going to be gone all the time doing training trips.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000 You go to a boat training and then the O.R.E.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Training.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 So you're going to be home a lot more.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Yes.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 Yep.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000 And so at that point, I was ready to go back to school.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000 So as soon as I got there, I was already enrolled back in college on a cup.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000 A one year.
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000 I don't know what you call, but you know, they have military program.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000 So I was going to school Saturday and Sunday.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 They're not out on my upper level units from my bachelor's
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000 degree and then I was working on my lower level units at the same time.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000 So I wanted to finish up my degree in about three years.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000 And so I'm there going through the training.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000 We're home away trips every now and then every now and again.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000 And it was good man.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000 I had good leadership in there.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000 You know, the special warfare combat and craft crewmen.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 Them dudes are square the way.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000 And so I got to learn a lot about the boats.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000 And that play off.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000 Or it helped me out later on because you really learned in, you know,
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000 a how far can these things go load capacity.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000 All those key tactical things that matter when it comes into a mission planning process
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000 for training or for a mission.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000 Yeah.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000 And what's good is you start to relate those to helicopters and aircraft and vehicles.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000 And so it gives you a better sense because as a young team got,
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 I was really lucky.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000 I was a communicator.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000 I was a company guy.
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000 So I was always involved in the planning.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000 More than my peers.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Right.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000 And the point man might plan the the end, you know, the route.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000 But like I was like, okay, here's what we're going to,
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000 here's what we're going to do for communications during the insert.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000 And then once we're on target.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000 So I was more involved in the planning, which was super lucky.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000 And then I did Args where I was working with the Marine Corps and working with the big Navy.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000 So once again, what's the distance that this helicopter can take us to and
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 serve us?
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000 What's the distance that we can get with our boats?
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000 What's the distance that our ribs?
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000 Once again, the boats, how far can they take us?
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000 So I was very lucky that I got that opportunity because once you realize how to plan with assets,
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000 it's a big, you can transfers to all different assets.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000 It makes you, makes you smarter across the board.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000 Yep.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000 So all that was good.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000 So in, while was there at the boat at the boat dead, I was like,
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000 a not much going on in the 90s.
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000 I was kind of like ready to punch out of the military.
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000 And so I started putting him application for the CHP California Highway Patrol.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000 Went through all the interview process, all the testing, got my letter of acceptance.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000 And I was kind of just on standby.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000 I was going to transition out.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000 And then August of that year in 2001, I made Chief.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000 I don't know how that one made Chief that.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000 You know, I wasn't expecting to put it on.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000 It was like a total shocker, you know.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000 And then in September 2001, 9.11, I was at Garret Shed.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000 I'm staying in.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000 Man, we've been waiting a long time to get in the base.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000 I've been training for whatever.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000 I've been seven years.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000 Yeah, I was like, yep.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000 So, you know, from there, I worked with the CMC over team five.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000 You get back there and he's like, I got a potato chip slot open.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000 If you want him, I was like, hell yeah.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000 You rolled right into a platoon chief slot.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000 Yep.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000 After September 11th.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000 Yes.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000 So I went back to the team.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000 I left like a few months early, TAD to go back to team five until my orders could catch up.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000 And then got over there and like I think right around January, February timeframe.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 We started forming up our battalion, getting ready for a 12 month workup.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000 So you called the CMC at team five.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000 Yep.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 And today, bro.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000 Yeah, I wouldn't say I was saying, hey, bro.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000 But I got the other match you've had with me at the boat debt.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000 He was my second platoon chief.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 And he's like, hey, I'm working with Jimmy over here.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000 Team five.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000 You want to, you got a spot open.
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000 You want to.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000 I was like, hell yeah, I want it.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 Dude, my point is like.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000 It man, build some good relationships with people.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000 Yeah.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000 Build some good relationships with people.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000 Yeah.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000 Because that pays off.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000 Yeah.
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000 That means you, how do you build good relationships?
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000 Not by kissing ass by working hard by doing a good job.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 That's how you build good relationships.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000 When I checked into team seven after September 11th is actually like whatever
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000 Two years after September 11th.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000 My, the CEO there, which first of all, the detailer who I was friends with,
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000 sent me to the next deploying team.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000 So when I left, I had to go to college for a CMC animal program.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000 When I left college, I went to the next deploying team.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000 Yeah.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000 That's not luck bro.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.000 Yeah.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000 And then when I got to the team, the command officer who I'd also work for in the past,
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000 fired a platoon commander and put me in as a platoon commander, whatever three months before
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000 deployment.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000 That's just, you know, that's based on my past performance.
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000 Yeah.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000 And relationships for sure, but relationships are built on the fact that I worked hard
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000 and was trustworthy to get the job done.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 Yeah.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000 So you never, plus you just never know who you're going to be working with.
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000 No.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000 You know, don't burn any bridges, man.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000 Don't burn any bridges.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000 Yeah.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000 And just go back to what you're saying there that your credibility in the teams is everything.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000 Your reputation.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000 Yeah.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000 And you don't want to have a reputation of being a, you know, a jackass.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 You're a jackass.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000 Yeah.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000 You're a cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 You don't want to be that.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000 Yeah.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000 And the reputation is, is a, I don't know what the word to describe it.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000 It is a heavy thing that sticks with you.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000 It's actually, it's a sticky thing.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000 It's a sticky thing.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000 And if you have good reputation, it'll stick with you.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 If you have a bad reputation, it'll stick with you.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000 It can take people years to overturn a bad reputation.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 Yeah.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000 And interestingly, it can also take people years to ruin a good reputation.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Yeah.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Like a person with a good reputation can make mistakes and people like all you
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 get.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000 I don't worry about it's friend.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000 You know, it's good to go.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000 Or a person with a bad reputation can make one little slip up and people like you got to be
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000 kidding me.
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000 We need to get rid of this guy.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000 Pull us, try to get him out.
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000 Yeah.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.000 Yeah.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000 I like, and I hate to say that because right, right, that's like, that's like, what?
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000 That's like political and all this stuff.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000 But it's just the reality, the situation.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000 And there's, there's a reason for that.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 Because a look, human beings are going to mess up.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000 But if you, I guess the difference is you have a good, a good person with a good reputation.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000 They earn that reputation by consistent good performance.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000 Yeah.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000 And eventually that reputation stands on its own.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:05.000 And therefore, if they make a mistake, which everyone's going to make mistakes, when they make a mistake, when they make a mistake, which they will, people go, oh, you know, like, guess what?
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000 You know what?
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000 They've done a hundred good things.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000 That's how they built that reputation.
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000 Now here comes a bad one.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000 All right.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000 Well, we're carry on.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000 Whereas, if you've done a bunch of bad things.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000 And now you do something bad.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000 You're good.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000 You don't have any leg to stand on.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000 Yep.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000 Yep.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000 You're screwed.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000 So that reputation thing.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000 And it's everywhere.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000 It's everywhere, but man in the teams, it's a big thing.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000 It's a big thing.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000 It's damn near everything.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000 It's damn near everything.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000 It's damn near everything.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 You're rep.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000 So you roll in.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Now you're a political, a political chief at team five.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000 Yep.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000 Get ready to deploy.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Yes.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Yep.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000 But at what point do you realize you guys are going to Iraq?
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000 We didn't know until probably January 2003.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000 So we're, you know, I get there in October 2001.
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000 January February 2002.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000 We started our 12 month long work up cycle.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000 And then it's going through and it looks like we're going into Iraq.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000 You know, we no one really understood the scale of that thing.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000 How big it would wind up being.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000 How many years it wind up being, you know?
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000 So when they told us how you're going over,
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000 we were like hell.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Yeah.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000 Yeah.
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000 This is awesome.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Because you, like everybody else in the teams,
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000 was worried that there would be a three month war and you'd miss the whole thing.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000 Exactly.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000 Exactly.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000 Which is so hard to explain to people, especially now that we've been a war for almost 20 years straight.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000 Yeah.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000 It's hard to explain to people how much it meant to go to war when there was no war going on.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000 Yeah.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000 It was everything.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000 Like you were just like, man, this is going to be awesome.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000 You know, it's getting prep.
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000 You know, like, I don't know what to expect.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000 Everyone was thinking they had chemical weapons.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000 You know, we were going through all kinds of mob drills with our CBR gear and just going through everything.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000 Are you with you guys were getting everyone tuned up so we were dialed in.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Then you're looking at the freaking mob uniforms.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000 Yeah.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000 And it's like got a elastic drawstring at the waist and like you're thinking,
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Wait a second.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 Yep.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000 This is supposed to keep me alive and happen.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 Whatever.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000 Let's rock and roll.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000 Did you ever think that you ever take that charcoal freaking light laden suit and be like,
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000 Hey, how would it wait?
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000 You're saying this thing's going to save me?
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000 It's got some elastic drawstring around the ankles and that's supposed to keep me good to go.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000 Yeah.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000 That that mob suit didn't have a good reputation.
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Do you?
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000 Sure.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000 It was it was lacking.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000 I don't know what the US government paid for those mob suits.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000 And what level of security they provided us,
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000 but I don't have a lot of confidence.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 The idea was a lot.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000 And the gas masks do like one of the chances.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000 Yep.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000 But that's where we were getting told we were going to do.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000 And not one single guy said, no, because we did.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000 I did one.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000 Up where we mopped up because we thought we were hitting a target that had allegedly.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Some whatever chemical weapons.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000 And you know what everyone did.
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000 Everyone got jocked up.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000 Everyone put those gas masks on.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000 Everyone put those stupid freaking uniforms on.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000 And I'll tell you what we had quite a few missions when we got over to Iraq.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000 What we were going around with some of those three letter agencies looking all over the place.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000 Seeing what was around.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000 And everything we saw was was old.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000 It was like it been there left.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000 You know, nothing knew at all.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000 You know, um,
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000 As far as CBR, CBR.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000 Yeah.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000 She had like all the facilities and everything was like nothing's been here for a long ass time.
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000 So.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000 So all right, well, let's, so you get them with your work up.
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000 You find out you're going to Iraq in January.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000 And you guys are going on deployment in like April or something.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yep.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yep.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 April timeframe.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000 So a team three was already over there and just going back to your relationships.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000 Peace.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000 We had a couple guys on the battoons that were dialed in with some team three guys.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000 And they started sharing information.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000 You know, back and forth.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Hey, here's what's going on.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 Here's what to expect.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000 So that gave us a really good idea on what we needed to prep for.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000 And so right around April timeframe, we deploy over to Kuwait and work stage in Kuwait,
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 Wait and go into Iraq.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Team three's, I think, wrapping things up at that point.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 We might already turned over with them.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Um, and we're actually in, um, Kuwait for a handful of weeks.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000 I want to say right around three weeks.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000 And we actually did our first all about a Kuwait into Iraq on 53's.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Yeah.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000 That was, that sounded like a crazy out.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000 It was good.
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000 It was a good shake out.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000 Nothing, nothing happened.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 But we planned for 96 hours.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000 We went through all of our helicopter aerosols.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000 You know, and it was a big, obliverted up those, uh, our D.P.V.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000 He's Desmond Role vehicles.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000 And we went in with a big package.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000 And we, what was your mission?
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000 To go take down the, the dam.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Get control.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Control.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000 He did.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000 It wasn't a deed.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000 There was somewhere up north, the Mucorium.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000 Okay.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Mucorium dam.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 So, uh, we went up there.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000 And it was a long ass flight in there.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000 And we're all jacked up on the cat.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000 Now, you think you're going to get in the shit.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000 You know, we're flying there.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000 We got her.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000 He and our plan laid out.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000 Case of helicopter.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000 Get shot down.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000 We got our mob gear with us.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.000 Yeah.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000 And we're roping down off 53's onto the dam.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000 With our CBR gear, you look like, you know,
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 Mitchell and snowman.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 Do you mask up when you, when you fast roped?
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 We were not.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000 The, the game plan was secure the dam.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Get everything set up.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000 Get everything cleared.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000 And then they had some tunneling systems in there.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000 Because it was a dam.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000 They wanted us to go inside the tunneling system.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000 See if there's any, you know, weapons, a mass destruction or chemical weapons in there.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000 So the, once we secure the dam, which took a little while,
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000 because you don't only think about how big a dam is on the inside.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000 There's a lot of shit going on in there.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000 This is a one-platoon up.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000 This is, so we had like a bar.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000 We had a two plus.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000 We had a two plus.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000 We had our, our mobility element.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000 And we also brought in some, as TV brothers,
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000 which was good.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000 They'd already been there.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000 And they'd clear the tunnel ships small, you know,
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000 little, what do you call the little boats out there?
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Dows.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Dows.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000 They cleared a tunnel.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000 So these guys had already.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Had some reps on the boat.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000 So we were excited to get them on the opposite.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000 But yeah, we went in there, on the vent,
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000 filled clear to chuck the tunnels, nothing there.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000 Then we, you know, waited there a couple days.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000 And then we pulled out.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000 But that, that's a, that's like a big,
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000 that's the big mesh that we were planning for in the 90s.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000 Like that type of fig.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000 Yeah.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Like hey, here it is.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Yeah.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000 You're going to heal a win.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000 This is the big mesh.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000 And plus, that was your first combat operation.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000 Yes.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000 Yep.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000 It was a big deal.
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000 We felt good to get that under our belt.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000 And we, we, it was a good shake out for planning.
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000 Because, you know, you're either going through the 96 hour planning cycle.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000 Um, a lot of good lessons learned.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000 First time using 53 is on an automation like that.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000 So it was good.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000 You know, in one of the things I jacked up is me and another guy on our medical guy's
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000 squad, the way to stay in the teams for a while.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000 But we rope down.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000 And we had our CBR gear strapped on our sides.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000 And so it was we're coming down.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000 We got that damn molly pack.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000 You know, you got a weave it in and out of the, the nylon.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000 I didn't weave mine in and out like I was supposed to.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000 So I went through a couple, but I left like the bottom on done.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000 And I don't know if I hit the wheel or the skin of the aircraft, but that thing, that damn thing
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000 came popping off.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000 Of course, I had my MVGs in there.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000 Ooh, the heel, you know, and the, uh, the backpack goes over the side.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000 Same thing with the other cat that was with me.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000 We think the world of wash, you know, put it in the river and stuff.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000 And everybody was talking about, hey, it's not a big deal.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000 You can, you get, you know, right it off as a combat.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000 It's a combat loss.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000 That's what everyone was talking about.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000 You know, like, all right, I guess it's not the big video.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000 Calm about last.
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000 I was like, do the skipper was not happy.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000 The combat loss right off was not a thing.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000 Yeah.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000 Well, what's really not a thing is trying to do a night clearance without nods.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000 Yeah, night vision.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000 We white lighted everything then.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000 Okay.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000 So back then, we're coming up on the damn we're white lighten it.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000 And then even the clearance on the inside.
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000 So you were lucky.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000 In that respect.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000 What do you mean?
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000 I'd say it if you, you said you lost your nods, right?
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.000 Oh, yeah.
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.000 Yeah.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000 I'm saying you're lucky that you didn't, you didn't need them.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Yeah.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Yeah.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000 Yes.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000 That is accurate.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000 Because that would have freaking, you'd have just been blind to walking around.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000 Yeah.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Yeah.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 Walk into a wall.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.000 Yeah.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000 It was just buddy along with somebody.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Yeah.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000 It was a good lesson for me.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000 Did you, uh, that little Molly weave?
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000 How many Molly weaves did you make?
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000 Like two?
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000 I think I had about three in there.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000 I think there was around five.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000 And I just left out the last two and snap that end.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Snap that end.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Snap that end.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Yeah.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000 Snap that end.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000 Get her done.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000 She's good.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000 Not so good.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000 Yeah.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000 How did you get such a good one?
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000 And the skipper was pissed.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000 Oh, he was hot.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000 And I was on the mat with him.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000 Like he's, you know, called me to task all that way.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000 Yeah.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000 Luckily, like I said, you had a good reputation.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000 Like if you had a bad reputation at that point, that would really suck.
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000 Yeah.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000 Yeah.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000 Would have really sucked.
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Yep.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000 So that was your first big mesh.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000 And then what?
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000 But that was out of Kuwait.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000 That was out of Kuwait.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.000 Yep.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000 And then what happened?
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000 Then we moved up into Baghdad.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000 We had a little camp set up out there.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000 I'd call camp pose.
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000 You know, we had a, I don't know if you know,
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000 opposed you, but it could go more and more on serving.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000 And I'm doing good.
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000 Good scores.
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000 Good scores.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.000 And the best.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000 And we had another guy we called him Ranger.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000 And, uh, those two dudes came in.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000 And we were going to build out the camp.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000 You know, we took a Ranger with us on, uh,
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000 on the fight a few missions.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000 Good dude.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000 And then we just started operating out of Posey into Baghdad.
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000 Yeah.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000 We were right there at the Baghdad International Airport.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000 And what I was impressed with looking back,
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000 or what I am impressed with at looking back is,
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000 you guys were freaking super proactive in getting missions started.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000 Like you guys were super proactive in forming relationships.
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000 Yep.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000 And getting me and tell that you needed from various sources.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000 And, and starting to do a lot of operations.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000 Yeah.
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000 We set the foundation for you guys.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000 Yeah.
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:47.000 Yeah.
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000 Yeah.
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000 As came in it did like four times more than what we did.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000 But we were definitely in laying that foundation.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000 And one of the things we had our task unit senior enlisted leader.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000 Um, he was dialed in and he came from Damnet.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000 Mm-hmm.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000 And so he had a lot of good relationships.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000 Yeah.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:01.000 You know, you know,
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000 Damnet was over there at that point.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000 And so he was tied in with a lot of the three letter agencies,
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000 which opened up the door with quite a few missions,
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000 shared intelligence.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000 So that really helped set that foundation for us.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000 And then from there we were starting to get,
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000 you know, some good missions.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000 And hell even if you're getting one mission, you're like,
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000 all right, we're good to go, you know,
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000 because you think we all think we're going to be out of there with then six, seven months.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000 Like the whole thing shutting down.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000 Yep.
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000 Um, but obviously it didn't.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000 Yeah.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000 So, what was your, you guys got in some gun fights, too?
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000 Yeah.
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000 What was the first one like, what do you remember?
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000 Our first shoot I was kind of funny.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000 We were dialing in our standard operating procedures for a shootout.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000 Um, which we had done.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000 Like, you know, we went through training training was good,
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000 but it was nowhere near the level that, you know,
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000 we provided our guys once we got over to trade it.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000 Wasn't anywhere near that.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000 So we identified a few of the gaps we had.
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000 And we went, we developed, we brought on the batoon,
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000 we brought in guys with experience.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000 And we developed our standard operating procedure for what we're going to do
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000 inside a house if we get in a shootout.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000 And it was basically a press fire cover crash maneuver using a cover move
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000 and we're going to deploy some crashes.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000 So, what's going to be, it's a press and fire while that's happening.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000 So, on this particular mission, we went in and, uh,
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000 the house, the guy Mark Force was the wrong house.
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000 We didn't know that.
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000 We want imagery, everything looked down, then tight,
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000 and they market.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000 It looks good.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000 We go in.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000 Breach the door.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000 So we gone exposed.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000 So now the neighborhood started to wake up.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000 We clear the house.
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000 I kept everything on the clock.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000 We clear the, you know, two story house in under two minutes.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000 We get the call on the net a reset.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000 The actual target house is down the street.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000 So we reset, we consolidate, you know,
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000 ones on the left, two is on the right, gear check,
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000 you know, sensitive equipment check.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Everyone's good.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000 Come back out of the house, grab our wood ladders,
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000 patrol back down the road and the right house is marked.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000 And we go up there.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000 And it was the right house.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000 It had a double security screen door.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000 We go to close up on it.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000 We got a, a fail breach.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000 So now it's turned into a big construction project.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000 The guys were up and nothing mentioned it just so everybody knows like after you
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000 hit the first house, everybody in a two mile square radius knows what's happening.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000 And if you're in that neighborhood, you know exactly what's happening.
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000 So if you're a bad guy in that neighborhood,
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000 you are now alert and ready to be attacked and you're prepping.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000 Yep.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000 Exactly.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000 So now we got to fail breach.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000 We're on the outside of the structure.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000 The preachers are working through getting through that heavy security screen door.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000 We're kind of raken windows.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000 We're deploying crashes in there to keep people away from the front door.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000 We finally get entry clear the first floor.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000 Everything's good.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000 We're dialed in and back then we always pressed into our guys.
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000 Hey, you make the call.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000 If you stack on the stairs, you're the number two guy.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000 You got three or four more guys behind you.
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000 Make the call and go up the stairs.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000 We don't want to just have this lag period where you're waiting for.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Me or the OIC to make a decision.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000 Tell you what to do.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000 Decentralized command.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000 So the guy stack on the stairs.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000 I'm right there.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000 I just came out of the kitchen area.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000 They start moving up the stairs and there's young kid upstairs with an AK 47.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000 So he's like 10 feet away and he's just full auto.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000 Guy's, our guys are on the stairs.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000 They're trying to return fire.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000 But the, the volume's just all around our dudes, man.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000 I'm young in the guys get back down here.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000 They come back down the stairs.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000 And then we go through our shootout procedures, which, which paid dividends.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000 They worked.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000 We couldn't shoot get at the guy because the guys on the second deck are now working down the loan.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000 So there's no way to get the direct fire.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000 So our guys are exposing themselves a little bit trying to get an angle here.
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000 Guys are deploying crashes.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000 We deployed about five, six crashes.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000 There's no more gunfire.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000 We're like, all right, check.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000 We're going up.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000 So, you know, we go up the stairs.
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000 The kid had actually dropped his gun.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000 We clear the second deck.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000 There's freaking smoke everywhere.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000 So he's just, I mean, we're gagging.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000 There's so much smoke in the house.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000 Go up there.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000 The guy's not there.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000 We're like, where the hell this guy go?
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000 And our guys go out on the deck patio.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000 And they're clearing.
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000 And now we're looking really hard.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000 Like, where is this guy?
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000 And the kid is a young kid hiding behind curtains.
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000 And, you know, the guy's there.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000 And then boom, our guys, Mosul Strike the guy.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000 Get him into the center room.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000 We cuff him up.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000 And that was that.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000 So, they didn't want to get hit by him by the bad guy.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000 And also these, you know, our, our guy had enough of the stairs.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000 First, the first guy up, he had a graze over his NVGs.
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000 But actually, he had his, his mount.
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000 But he didn't get hit.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000 It was like, it was a total pulp fiction pulp fiction.
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000 And then boom, boom, boom.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.000 Yeah.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000 Like he had angels on his.
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000 Because I could have been a bad guy.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000 And I would get a two, three guys hit in that one ball.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000 And no one got hit.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000 We, we were extremely lucky.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000 How many, how many rounds do you think the guy shot one mag or two mags?
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000 Did he get a reload?
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000 No, no, no, he didn't get a reload.
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000 I think you got a full mag off somewhere in between 25 and 30 rounds.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000 Damn dude.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Yeah.
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000 From 10 feet.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.000 Yeah.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000 Yep.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000 Close.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000 Yeah.
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000 I mean, I don't know how he probably missed because he was on full auto.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000 You know, those things get, you're just bouncing all around and going full auto.
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000 And the dude, you know, the guy was just a total douche bag of shot as two.
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000 He was like, I love towards push.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000 I love Coca-Cola.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000 And you're like, you should shut up, man.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000 So yeah, we cuffed him up.
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000 And that was, that was emotional when you're getting shot at that close and you're dealing with the bad dude that just tried to kill you.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000 You know, those emotions get jacked up pretty high.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000 Um, we had some good teammates there.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000 I mean, I was, I wanted to kill the dude.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000 Um, but you can't do that, you know, as much as you want to.
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000 You're gonna, it's not gonna be good.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000 But we got him cuffed up, took him over to our attention facility and, you know, the guys did good that night.
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000 And they did good because of the training, the talk throughs that we did.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000 Going through the checklist, going through multiple rehearsals.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000 Every time these missions came up, all that paned out, all that worked in our favor.
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000 For that one event, for that one shoot out, that all worked for us.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000 You know, having, uh, having contingency plans, which is that what you guys had.
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000 And it's what, you know, we have all kinds of contingency plans.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000 I mean, every eye add, every immediate interaction truly we do is a contingency plan.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000 Like, oh, if we could shot that from over there, we're gonna, we're gonna do.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000 So having those contingency plans, it just makes it so that you don't really have to think.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000 Decentralized command just works.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000 Everyone knows what to do.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000 They know what the objective is.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000 They make it happen.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000 And so you can make very little call, very very, you can give a very little direction.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000 And things still will proceed the way they're supposed to.
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000 Yeah.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000 What about, um, what about your next, what about your next gunfight?
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000 So our next one, I think, was our, our helicopter.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000 So we've gone in after this guy and he, um, he shot an RPG and killed an army guy.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000 And so we were going in after him.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000 And so we came in, we did quite a bit of heel work that deployment.
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000 So we came in with our helicopters and our game plan was to, you know, land on the X assault the building and get grab a guy and go.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000 And he was out in this, uh, think we actually out in Feluso, Romani.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000 So there were some palm grows out there.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000 So on insertion, we come in in the helicopters went to the wrong house.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000 You know, our RPGs back then, they're kind of, they're not good.
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000 So we could see how that.
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000 So we, we, we sat down or like, this is not the right house.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000 Get back up.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000 They get back up, they get back up, do one orbit, come back into the right house.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000 Land us.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000 We dump off, clear the building, everything's on a bit of a, we get the bad guy.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000 Now as we're going through all the, uh, sensitive side exploitation, we're trying to grab as much as we can on this guy.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000 You know, we get a report as we're breaking out that hey, there's two or three armed guys coming your way through this palm grove.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000 So the helicopters were, a ways out, but we had a gun chip overhead.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000 And so we set up a quick hasty perimeter, little fushook and we're going to wait to see if these guys came into us.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000 Well, they never came into us.
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000 They sent something was wrong and they bagged out.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000 So we get set up in the palm grove and we're calling in the helicopters at this point to come pick us up.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000 And as we're setting up the perimeter, you know, someone calls out over the radio.
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000 Hey, man, there's a tracer father just won by.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000 And no one else had seen us.
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000 One dude paying attention in his field of fire.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000 She's one round come in.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000 And so we calls it out.
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000 So we kind of go on hyper alert here.
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000 We're waiting for watching and as the heroes are coming in this dude, they were probably like 300 yards from us.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000 They start opening up with triple a fire over our LZ.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000 Now the only thing protect us at that time is we had a palm grove.
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000 And the LZ's here in the house is somewhere over here.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000 So this tracer fire is coming over the palm grove.
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000 And the issue we had is like communicating this back up the chain.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000 We had our tashkin to command around the ground with us on this one.
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000 And some people just didn't see this shit.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000 Some people didn't see the tracer fire coming.
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000 And I picked it up pretty damn quick once the guy called it out.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000 And you know, I call you shit.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000 That's a good volley of fire.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000 We're going to get a helicopter shot down in front of our car.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000 So anyways, the helicopter comes in, picks up the package, grabs our headquarters on the bay bounce out.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000 And then we just go over to our secondary LZ, which was pretty easy.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000 But it was very uncomfortable known that you got triple a fire coming over the top of you.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000 You know, when he said he looks get shot down, this is going to be a long night,
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000 especially out here in this rural area.
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000 We didn't have to be back up.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000 And then what was your up tempo like?
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000 It wasn't bad.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000 It wasn't like we were going out, taking a target every night.
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000 But we would, we got a point there where we were going out at least twice a week.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000 I'd say once or twice a week.
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000 And more like twice a week.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000 But in between that, we were doing other stuff.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000 Yeah, mobility stuff.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000 We're going to do a little bit of sniper stuff here and there.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000 Which was, which was good.
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000 And then just going back on decentralized command, you know,
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000 the other CQC or close court combat sheet,
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000 we had, you know, our guys were going up to this house.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000 And man, there's freaking telephone wires everywhere.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000 And you know how that is.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000 You're like, there's no rhyme or reason why.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000 How do you guys live with this?
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000 There's wires wires everywhere.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000 You know, we got to hop over this damn gate, you know, to get to this house.
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000 So we literally like 30 or 40 wires like you could be just total mayhem wires.
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000 Yep.
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000 And we plan for.
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000 We actually picked it up on the energy.
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000 We're going through our rehearsals and we're like, hey, there's wires everywhere.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000 It's your coming over.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000 It's this spot right here.
01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000 Be careful.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000 Don't get your nods.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Hit on them.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000 Don't, you know, we got to be quiet.
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000 So we start going up and over.
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000 We get the entry team over.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000 And actually, we had our full squad in the courtyard because the distance from the gate to the actual house was a lot.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000 It was a big house.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000 So we needed a soldiers up front.
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000 So we get up front.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000 And the, you know, the entry teams going through, you know,
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000 our breaches going through laying the charge on the door.
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000 Going through all the procedures.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000 And the next thing you know, you get this whack bang bang bang doors around your coming through the door.
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000 And so, you know, our breacher, we borrowed him from another petone.
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000 He was dialed in good dude.
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000 You and Dave know.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000 But so he's, he's laying the charge and he's using his cover right if he's in the center of the door.
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000 The dudes getting shot.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000 No, what the 45 calipestal.
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000 But he's off to the side using his covers like he's supposed to.
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000 Set's the charge.
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000 Our guys are the guys holding security.
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000 They go through our standard operating procedures.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000 They're waking the windows.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000 They're shooting in through the window to get the person away from it.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000 And they're dumping crashes and to keep the person away.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000 Kick them out away from the doorway.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000 So boom, we blow it.
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000 Of course, it's a propane tank there.
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000 So the whole damn doorway catches on fire.
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000 So now we can't, you know, we've got to fill breacher.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000 We can't get into the doors open.
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000 But there's just this massive propane fire going on.
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000 So we got to go to our secondary door.
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000 You get over the secondary door.
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000 And these dudes got a damn drop on her on there.
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000 So we, you know, we need to took us forever to get a,
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000 it was a shit show.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000 We get entry into the, into the doorway and there's like a family of eight people sleeping in there.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000 And they're like, they're still sleeping.
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000 Like, how is it possible?
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000 We just blew in your door.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000 There's gunshots going on.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000 You, or you all are still, like physically sleeping.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000 Like zombies, you know.
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000 So anyways, we got in there clear the building.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000 That sounds so unbelievable if you haven't been into Iraq before.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000 Like, you can't explain things like that.
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000 Yeah.
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000 You can't, you can't explain things like that.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000 To get an explosive breach of failed breach.
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000 And then we got a huge shock.
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000 That's going off of fire and the team, the freaking family just racked out.
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000 Yep.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000 They racked out.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000 And there was zombies, man.
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000 What did you ever catch the guy that was shooting through the door?
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000 Yeah, it was, it was actually the, I think it was one of the guys wife shooting through there.
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000 She's like, hey, I thought you, thought you were looters.
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000 You're like, coming into Robert House.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000 I don't know.
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000 Like, yeah, no, we're not looters, you know.
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000 But anyways, we got that situation all squared away.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000 That's a rough, that, that,
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000 Well, when I say that's rough one, that's the kind of mission where things can go really sideways.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000 Like, if you start fracking that room, which you could easily do to say,
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000 Hey, look, we just got shot at.
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000 I'm throwing some frag grenades into this room.
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000 And actually, you know, you got a family eight person family that are getting blown apart by
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000 Frag grenades because the woman was trying to defend her house from looters, which again,
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000 may sound like a crazy story.
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000 And it could also be the absolute 100% truth.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000 I don't know. I'm not going to try and, you know, replay the situation that you lived through.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000 But that could be legit.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.000 Yeah.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000 And you have no idea that we're out there.
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000 And now to been, now to been horrible.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000 Yeah, I'm in a fracking nightmare.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.000 Yep.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.000 Yep.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000 Any other big missions that you guys did,
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000 did you guys do like some, some like, SA7 recovery hours?
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000 So we, I forgot about that one.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000 So we were out, we went out there, you know, we're going with some other
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000 intel people out there and they're like, hey, we're going after some of this sensitive
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000 stuff here and we, you know, anyways.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000 So we went and hit this farmhouse.
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000 We got good air coverage overhead of us.
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000 No one's there.
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000 The place is a ghost town.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000 We start going through our sensitive side exploitation.
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 And man, it was like a gold mine.
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000 You know, the, the perimeter around it was just this big huge cash.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000 And so we found a truckload of, you know,
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000 SA7 and SA14 missiles, the ton of RPGs,
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000 uh, rock about pelgrinades and launchers.
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000 And so thanks started getting a little spicy around the areas.
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000 We're calling them a little bit of a fire support.
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000 And we actually had to turn that over to an army unit who came in the next day during
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000 daylight and they started going through the field.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000 And then I was like, right, I mean, it was like radio.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000 It was like enough shit to outfit a damn army.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000 You know, um, so that was a, that was a good off, nothing happened.
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000 But we found a lot of stuff.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000 So you know, you leave there feeling pretty good about it.
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000 And that, so that was a good, that was a freaking great deployment for you guys,
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000 especially in like, whatever, 2003, that, that deployment was pretty freaking epic.
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000 Oh, man, we left there and we're like, where are the man?
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000 More and ever coming back here again.
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000 Yeah, because no one had, no one ever thought you'd be back there again.
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000 No, no, no, it was good.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000 And so the one thing we did that was really good with our patoon,
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000 that we learned from the team three guys when we,
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000 we relieved them as we shared information.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000 You know, I was back with, you know,
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000 you're, you're brother there, team one, communicate everything I had back to him.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000 Here's what we're doing, here's what worked, here's what,
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000 here's what, here's what didn't work, here's some things to think about with mobility.
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000 Mm-hmm.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 And you just try to share as much information as possible, you know.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000 Yeah.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000 That way the next guys coming in, they know what to expect.
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000 And they can adjust training coming into high level, ready to rock and roll.
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000 I know when you guys came in, you guys did, I don't know, four times, four, five times.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000 I'm out of mission as we did for that deployment.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000 Yeah, well, you get, you guys were pushing a lot of information back to us.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000 I know you guys were feeding my Poutoon Chief.
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000 And my Poutoon Chief was already like a mobility kind of mobility dude.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000 That's how he was just amped bro.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000 We were doing freaking, uh,
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000 freaking tire change drills like NASCAR, like a pit crew.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000 I mean, it was just like it was on.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000 But here's the funny thing, we were on an ORE prior to that deployment.
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000 So like maybe three months before going on a deployment,
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000 we were on an ORE, we did our ORE ship board.
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000 And we went and we were doing hydrographic reconnaissance of red beach up in Camp Pendleton.
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000 We've led live in Slate, dude.
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000 Like it was the world hadn't caught up.
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000 Yep, right?
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000 The world hadn't caught up yet.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000 And thank God, you know, like after that, we found some home v's.
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000 We borrowed home v's from like the C-B's or something.
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000 And started running up running, you know, training ops down at like the old NTC,
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000 the old Naval Training Center where they had a bunch of old buildings that were all dilapidated.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000 But we started running little ops in there with our, you know,
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000 and our task unit commander had actually been in Iraq on the push-ups.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000 So he had some experience, our task unit SCA had also been in Iraq on the push-ups.
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000 So he had some experience, um, which was awesome, and they're both great guys.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000 So we were, and we were just going off of the reports of how you guys were doing stuff.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000 And we were just like, okay, this is what they're doing.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Cool, this is what we're going to do.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000 This is what they did. This is how they rigged their vehicles. Okay.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000 This is how we're going to rig our vehicles. So that's kind of what we did.
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000 And then I know you and I did a turnover in that.
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000 Was it, we did a like, ball rain, right?
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000 Yeah, ball rain, that's where I was at.
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000 We had a, put two left up there in a mobile, it almost left up there.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000 Yeah. We came back a few weeks early out of ball rain just because there was enough room to bring everyone in.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000 So, yeah. So we sat down, did it awesome turnover with you guys with you and your OIC.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000 Yep. Who's up for a great dude. That was awesome.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000 And that was kind of like, I knew who you were.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000 Yeah.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000 Just from, I guess, being around.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000 But then that was, that was when I was like, that's when I first really remember getting a working.
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000 Like, you know, I might have seen you on the piece or something.
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000 You know, but the first time I ever actually got a working.
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000 I think that was the first time I ever did some kind of working.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000 I think that was the first time I crossed paths with you.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Yeah.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000 Always hear the name out there. I mean, I was roommates with Taco and Taco had nightmares
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000 stores with you and Chris. Those guys, man, they need a quick beat in us up.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000 You were, you were, you were hostile.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000 See on the seals. Yeah.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000 We had the gang mentality for sure.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000 For sure.
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000 So when would you do when you got home from that deployment?
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000 So got back off that deployment.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 There was another Petunchev slot open.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000 So the seems to be like, hey, man, you, the guy that was going to come doesn't look like
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000 a company. You want to do another one. I was like, hell, yeah, so then, you know,
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000 started forming up another Petunchev. Got a bunch of new guys in new I see and started
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000 another 12 month work up cycle.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000 Dang.
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000 That's, you have freaking two Petunchev slots.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000 Yep.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.000 Yep.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000 It was awesome.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000 Man, that's the best job in the world.
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000 The task unit spot is good.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000 Yeah.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:58.000 Yeah.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000 The Petunchev slots a lot.
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000 Oh, yeah.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.000 Petunchev.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000 I mean, I always say like, E5 and Petunchev.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000 I was just talking to some guys the other night that were E5.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000 I'm so glad like, hey, you're good, man.
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000 E5 and Petunchev is an awesome place to be.
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000 And it is.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000 It is. It's an awesome place to be. And hopefully you reach a point where you go,
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000 I can take care of those awesome guys.
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000 Yep.
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000 And that's when you go, okay, I'm going to be an hope you're going to be a Petunchev.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000 Or I want to be a, you know, if you go the officer route, you can try and go that
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000 officer route.
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000 But at some point, you realize the best thing I can do as it to be a good E5
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000 is to take care of the other FEE5s means I got to get promoted.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000 I got to take care of them.
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000 Yeah.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000 And the best way I can do that is to increase my rank a little bit.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000 Yeah.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000 I have a little bit more sway.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000 Yep.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000 We don't have to do dumb shit.
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000 Yep.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.000 Yep.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000 Yep.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000 I'm complaining about my boss.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000 You know, you can only complain so much before you got to actually do something about
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000 it.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.000 Yeah.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000 Absolutely.
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000 And it's rare that someone gets to do Platoon Chiefs back to back like that.
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000 I mean, no, it's rare that a guy even gets to do two Petunchev slots.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000 That's freaking rare.
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000 Yeah.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000 You were getting better at it now.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000 That's one of the things that I know with the headquarters level that we're looking
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000 at.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000 Our our our rating really took control over.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000 I hate you can only do one.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000 You got to move out of another guy's got to move in and they started looking at that
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000 because you know, we had.
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000 We were losing quite a few tactical leaders.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000 Like they're guys are getting fired.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000 Why are they getting fired?
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000 Hey, they need more seasoning.
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000 Yeah.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000 Hey, let's grab.
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000 Let's keep two three guys that are doing really good to keep that.
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000 Uh.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000 Going with the word on looking for continuity continuity at the team.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000 And these are dialed in people.
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000 You know, you can count on them and move it forward.
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000 So we've got better with with that over the last 10 years.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000 So those guys it's common now for your top two or three guys to stay the team.
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000 Even if they pick up senior chief.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000 They're going to stay in that Petunchev.
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000 Yeah, that's awesome.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:46.000 Yeah.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000 That's awesome.
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000 And so then you do another work up.
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000 You must have been freaking dialed now.
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000 You're doing a second Petunchev.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000 The second Petunchev was way easier than the first.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000 And the first one.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000 So I didn't do a Petunel PO.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000 So I was sucking on a fire house.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000 Okay.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000 You know what I'm saying?
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000 Yeah.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000 So you know, setting up the Petunes.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000 There's just, if you had never worked in training either.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000 Nope.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000 Not a team.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000 Yeah.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000 See, I'll tell you, man.
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000 My whole, you know, that's probably, you know, my first three Petunes.
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000 But leaders have strategy tactics.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000 We were talking about my first three Petunes.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000 I learned these certain things, right?
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000 Yeah.
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.000 And I wrote about it.
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000 Leadership strategy and tactics.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000 But where that was like where all these seeds got planted.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000 Yeah.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000 But I'll tell you what.
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000 You want to know where the fertilizer and the water came from on those seeds.
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000 It was working in training cell.
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000 It's the old team one.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000 Where I was a single, enlisted, he five.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000 And you know what trip I went on?
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000 Every free trip there was.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000 I taught everything.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000 I would volunteer for every course.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000 I, you know, we would go teach land warfare.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000 Then I teach diving.
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000 Then I teach CQC.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000 I just do it.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000 And I was the main instructor on any of them.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000 Yeah.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000 I was just a guy that was out there like I got on that trip.
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000 And that's where those little seeds started to come to fruition.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000 And the biggest thing was when you're instructing and you know this now that we worked in land warfare.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000 When you're running, when you're watching I ads or you're teaching I ads, you are defacto detached.
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000 So you're watching and you can see and you realize how easy it is when you're detached.
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000 And when you realize how easy it is when you're detached and you go away to second.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000 If I'm in there, I just need to take a step back and see what the hell's going on.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000 And that can make a good call.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000 So that is where I learned so much.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000 So for you of to not done that definitely had to make your first platoon chief go around a little rough.
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000 It was hard. I got lucky like the our sister platoon.
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000 That platoon chief was dialed in.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000 He'd done all those things. He was on his like seven platoon.
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000 I was doing my fourth at the time.
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000 And so I leaned on him. I'd ask him a hundred billion questions on things.
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000 And he always gave me good good guidance man.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000 Yeah.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000 So then you get done with that one.
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000 And now you're going through to get it now you're kind of like,
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000 I'm like, this is the day you're doing what the same issues.
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000 I got all my standard operating procedures in place.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000 So for every block attorney we're doing a plus you're a freaking combat that.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000 I'm a combat kind of the man.
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000 I'm ready to get after him.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000 So it was way easier man way easier.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000 You know, you're always going to have those same personnel issues.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000 And now you know how to deal with him.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000 You know what right looks like.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000 And then what was that?
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000 Then you were going back to Iraq again.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000 Yep.
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000 So we wound up back over, you know, you guys came in and late September 2003.
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000 We went back in September 2004.
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000 And the place was just the disaster.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000 Roadside bombs all over the place.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000 You know, the drill or the fighters all over the place was a shit show.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000 Yeah, that that was the end of my first deployment.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000 It was when we went and got your coupé, which was Saadur's guy.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000 That's the whole freaking thing.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000 And two of just a total mayhem.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000 Yep.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000 And we saw that.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000 We saw the like it was it was a radical change.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000 Yeah.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000 Because before that, like in would be in March of 2004, it was kind of like,
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000 Okay, we'll go to a mission in April.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000 We were, you could look out and you'd see smoke and fire vehicles burning.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000 Like it was totally, it was a very different scenario in that one month period in April of 2004.
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000 Yeah.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000 And it just got worse from there.
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000 Yeah.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000 And then we'd probably the time you guys showed up.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000 Yeah, it was a disaster.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000 I remember, and we were doing the PSD mission.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000 So we weren't doing a typical direct action.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000 But we got in there in my Paton.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000 We got split up.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000 So we're in squads now supporting other Patons.
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000 Because you need X number of people to protect these guys.
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000 And one of the good things that the headquarters element did is they rotated guys out for
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000 sniper mission.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000 So if you're sniper qualified, you come on in.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000 And so we covered down within our PSD elements.
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000 And guys, you go out and do sniper stuff.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000 So I was lucky.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000 I got to get out there on high for street a couple of times.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000 Were you a sniper?
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000 Yeah.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.000 Yeah.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000 Yeah.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.000 Yeah.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000 So I went through and went through sniper school in 98.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000 And that was back when there was out at cold.
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000 And then stuck.
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000 And when I got back off of that deployment, 99, I went to work for Mark.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000 He was running the sniper course.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000 So I did a couple of instructor, you know, courses with him.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000 So it was good.
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000 And that helped me out for, you know, the 2003 deployment 2004, the 2006 deployment.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000 Yeah.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000 But I remember getting out on high for street.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000 It was the first time we're out.
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000 And we did sniper work in 2003.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000 But there was nothing going on.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000 Everything was under control.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000 And I remember going out there.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000 We're supporting an army unit.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000 They're doing a clearance.
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000 So we come in, dump out of the Bradley setup in the buildings.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000 We got all our sectors covered.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000 And like there's this mooch and an apartment building with an RPG launching RPGs at a patchies that are in the area.
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000 And you know, the deal.
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000 Like you don't shoot a rocket from a room.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 That's not good.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000 Good practice, right?
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000 You're going to jack yourself up.
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000 He's just in there getting after don't dunk.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000 And like so the patchies come in and they're just like,
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000 oh, go, go, go, go. And they just take the dude out and you're like,
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000 Holy shit man, this place is not good.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000 Totally different.
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000 And then you come out for extra act.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000 The Brad's are coming in a pole sound.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000 Like there's rounds coming in at you.
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000 We didn't deal with that 2003.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000 2003, we had the upper hand.
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000 You know, you're operating at nighttime.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000 But we had the upper hand with what we were doing.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000 So it's just, it was different.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000 And then at that same time in 2004, you had Phantom Fury out there and
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000 Felizio going off.
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000 You know, and yet good dude supporting that.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000 And it's just, I'm ever looking up on the, the jocks screen.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000 And the marines are going through and doing a clearance nighttime.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000 And there's like grenades getting chucked out.
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000 And the marines are just going in and getting after it.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000 I mean, they're carrying like 25 mags in there.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000 Yep.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000 And going building by building.
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000 And like God bless the marine core man.
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000 These days are like bad asses.
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000 And we all wanted to be there.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000 Like hey, switch with us man.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000 Come do the PSD thing.
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000 We want to be out there doing what you're doing.
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000 But so anyway.
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000 So you know, Phantom Fury just died down.
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000 Like hey, we want to send a sniper element up to Samara.
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000 And so it was like, life got chosen to be a OIC.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000 And I was like, hey, they selected me to come in there with life.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000 I was like cool, put our 10 man, love man team together.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000 Went up to Samara.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000 We thought we were going to get after it.
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000 You know, it was go time.
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000 It was go time.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000 We were going to get someone.
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000 It was on event pole man, nothing happened.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000 We set up damn near.
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000 We were out in the streets every damn day, sitting up man.
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000 And it was just, you know, that the guys were going after their real cage.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000 It was like civilians.
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000 You know what you're going to be looking like.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000 They come in and said an ID.
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000 You know, they said it.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000 And they'd be out of there.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000 How many, how much did you spend?
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000 How much time did you spend on high fester?
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000 Not much.
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000 I would say I probably got out there about six or seven times total for that.
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000 And I was only in Iraq for 90 days during that time period.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000 And then you rotate it out to the Pacific.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000 Yep.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.000 Yep.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000 Over to P.I.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000 Yep.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000 Guam and P.I.
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000 And the PSD was, look, it was a hard mission and everything.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000 Yeah.
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000 But relatively un-eventful.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000 Because that sort of is possible.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000 So at that time, seals were providing security for the top seven.
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000 Something like that.
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000 Authority's in Iraq.
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000 And, you know, in charge of keeping them safe.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000 And they did an awesome job.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000 Yeah.
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000 But that, in doing an awesome job, men's there wasn't action.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000 Thankfully.
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000 Yeah.
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000 Because the action probably would have been a giant 2000-pom v-bid that would have killed everybody.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000 Or something crazy like that.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000 Yeah.
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000 2000-pom v-bid.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000 I was at first time, I really started seeing the, you know, the truck bombs, the car bombs,
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000 air building.
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000 And I mean, they built them, you know, they put so much explosives in them that the dam springs
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000 and shocks would break on them.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000 You know, if you're trying to get on base, I'm going to like jack-duff your head.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000 Yeah.
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000 Not good.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000 So, but that wrapped up another deployment for you.
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000 Yep.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000 And then, so then what, then what'd you do?
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000 I stayed at Team 5, I made a senior chief in 2005 picked up a team.
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000 Did you make it up for going to the fleet UD?
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000 Yeah.
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000 I mean, you're making rank quick.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000 Yeah.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000 No, you're making rank quick for, on average above average, it seems like you are.
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000 Yeah.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000 So, I would say probably above average up to chief.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000 And then, you know, I got passed over the first time for senior chief and then made it
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000 the second time.
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000 So, you know, you don't want guys to make rank too fast. You want guys to really understand what
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000 they're doing and why they're doing it, which takes time.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000 It takes a lot of reading, it takes for repetitions.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000 And I think when I put on chief, I didn't, I was undergunned, you know, with my training
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000 and my experience.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000 So, it was good that I got passed over my first time for senior chief.
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000 You know, so anyway, so I made senior chief in 2005 and then picked up a task in it.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000 And, you know, from there, we started working up to relieve you guys.
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000 When did you guys know that you were going to relieve us?
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000 I would say right around March, April, timeframe of 2006, right?
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000 When you were going to, so we got there.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000 Yep. Right around that same time.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000 Yep. Yep. They're like, hey, you guys are going to come in behind these guys and we're going to
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000 replace them.
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000 At what point did you guys start tracking like, what was happening?
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000 Did you guys start getting hot and heavy and what made you in timeframe?
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000 Yeah, an April time period.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000 Yeah. Like, as soon as we got there, it was getting crazy.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000 It was right around then.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000 And like, we, all of us were just kind of thinking, hey, it's going to be like a
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000 fullusious style clearance.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000 And fullusious went pretty quick.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000 You know, went pretty quick.
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000 You know, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of good work being done.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 A lot of people getting killed.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000 You a soldiers getting injured.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000 We thought it was going to be like that.
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000 We didn't know it was going to be what it was.
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000 You know, we didn't go on up against that type of enemy before.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000 Yeah, well, we thought it was going to be a fullusious type thing too.
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000 Yeah.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000 And we talked about this on the unraveling with Darryl Cooper that we,
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000 Well, that's where we got told when we got there.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000 They're like, hey, you guys are going to, we're going to do
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000 fullusious.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000 And we're like, thank you.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Thank you.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000 This is going to be because fullusious at that point was a real high watermark for
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000 for just awesome crushing kinetic operations by the Marine Corps.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000 And it was seals in their support and they did a great job.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000 So we were thinking, okay, like, it's on.
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000 And it's going to be whatever.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000 It's going to be two weeks or three weeks.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000 Maybe a fighting and we'll get cleared through this city.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000 But it ended up not going that way.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000 And then being that there's a smart move by the prime minister who is a
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000 Shea to recognize that if if the shea army, which,
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000 It basically was a she army went in there and did this type of crushing
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000 kinetic sweep through a body, which was most, which was Sunni.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000 They would have set up Sunni versus Shea civil war.
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000 And so he said, we're not doing that.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000 You're going to find another way to do it.
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000 And the other way to do it was a counter insurgency was going into the neighborhoods
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000 and trying to preserve the infrastructure and trying to keep the civil
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000 impopulous as safe as you can as you do it. And yet at the same time
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000 do battle with these insurgents.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000 So that's what that's what we ended up doing.
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000 And I always wonder what it was like for you guys once we started taking
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000 a lot of casualties.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Once we started losing guys, you guys must have been like,
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000 a little nervous about coming.
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000 Oh, hell yeah.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000 Absolutely man.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000 No one had been through that amount of combat.
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000 Like for us at that point, heavy combat.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000 You know, we had our group,
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000 Commodore, he was out there with us doing our,
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000 you know, ORE, what do they call the final battle problem?
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000 And he's like, man, you guys are going to a body stand by.
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000 There's a lot going on there.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000 There's like, I mean a lot going on there.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000 And I think things really hit home for us.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000 Like, remember, Cali, Cali come a bang when he was shot.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000 And like you look at the essential like, okay,
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000 that's manageable. Like, he shot.
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000 He's coming in through. It looks like he's going to be okay.
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000 And then shit really hit the fan for us when Mark was killed.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000 Really like holy shit.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000 This is we're going into something that we like,
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000 you know, we hadn't been in before.
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000 So we had like, we dialed in our training.
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000 We had like, we're giving this information.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000 Tell one of us everything you're doing.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000 What's working? What's not working?
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000 We had some hard conversations with our operators.
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000 Hey, man, like someone's going to get wounded.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000 Someone might get killed. Like,
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000 there's some of these things we can't control.
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000 What we can do is our rehearsals,
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000 train to this, make good decisions on the battlefield
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000 to reduce our casually levels.
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000 But we're going to be shot at.
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000 Someone's going to get hit. That's coming.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000 And at the end of the day, it's going to be a stand in here.
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000 That's going to kind of get us out of this shit.
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000 We're going to be going to be a tight game.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000 We've got to be tight with what we're doing.
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000 And the guys understood that.
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000 You know, the guys understood that.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000 But it's different when you get on the ground.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000 And you got a lot of rounds coming out to you.
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000 You know, yeah, you know,
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000 I'm trying to think of a way to explain the difference
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000 in my mind that you got.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000 Like, it seems like, but prior to that point,
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 most of the times when guys would go out.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000 You want to guys would go out and get wounded or
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000 guys would go out and know what had been killed.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000 And I rack yet, but even in Afghanistan,
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000 it was like, it was a mission, right?
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000 It was like a mission, an isolated mission where
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000 something had happened.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000 And then once that isolated mission is over,
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000 it's like you reset the clock.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000 And now, okay, we're in a different,
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000 it's a different mission.
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000 And so it's almost like you do get to reset the clock.
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000 But in a body, it was like you were in the same game.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000 And the clock was freaking ticking the whole time.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000 And so you guys knew that you were just going to come
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000 and get in the game and it wasn't going to be one mission.
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000 And it wasn't going to be three missions.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000 It was going to be mission after mission after mission after mission.
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000 And it was going to be as many days as you were there.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000 And yeah, I remember you guys showing up.
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000 And I remember actually briefing your task unit
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000 and literally saying,
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000 you guys are going to, you guys are going to take casualties.
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000 Which was the, it was the thing I was thinking of myself.
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000 Do I say that?
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000 Is that a bad attitude?
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000 Is that a negative attitude?
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000 Is that a self-fulfilling prophecy?
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000 Or is that just the fucking truth about what's going on?
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000 And I would rather have you guys thinking,
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000 okay, this is the truth.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000 And if we can avoid it, great,
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000 but we have to be ready.
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000 And we need to do everything we can, but we got to be ready for it.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.000 Yep.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000 I remember you guys were telling us, man,
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000 we had, we had our go bags ready.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000 So we got some get-singer to our standard operating procedure in place.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000 Who's going with the guy that's injured,
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000 all of our passports,
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000 ID's everything we're in the bag.
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000 Someone gets injured, boom, they're getting on the heel with the injured guy.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000 They're pushing out, you know,
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000 at least getting them over to Germany.
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000 So we were definitely in the right mindset.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000 You know, in our first op-out there,
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000 you guys helped set that up out there at Firecracker.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000 Oh yeah.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000 And that was, that was a good one with the Marine Corps.
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000 We said you guys have to firecracker for you.
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000 Yeah, first op.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000 So, you know, you're like, hey,
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000 you guys are going around race track.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000 And we'll just call this,
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000 we'll call this operation Firecracker.
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000 Because there's going to be some shit going down up there.
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000 Yeah.
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000 It was, it was a good first shake out,
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000 you know, in the Marine Corps's up there.
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000 You know, the Colonel that was running the Marine Corps for a good,
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000 his name.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000 Yeah, you just took good outstanding,
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000 good leader, just good, like good dude, man.
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000 So we set that up.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000 You know, there's, you know, our guys,
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000 our sniper's killed a few guys on that one,
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000 and the shoot was good.
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000 You know, and they, I'm just memory,
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000 I was at home be out in the street and he's pulling security down from us.
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000 And the dude starts, you know,
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000 gets a little bit of an RPG and like the Marines are dumping out of it.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000 They're doing cover move drills, getting back.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000 And they're taking small arms fire and work position where we can't,
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000 you know, the enemies in dead space,
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000 we can't even do anything to support them.
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000 They come back and there's a couple, like smaller mortars that came in that day.
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000 You know, didn't hit our building,
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000 the front of us there, wasn't too bad there or small,
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000 but it was a good, it was a good shake out for us,
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000 like a little confidence builder,
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000 like a couple bad guys, no one got injured.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000 These are all good things.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000 And then you guys start started rolling.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000 Then we started rolling in our first,
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000 I was on that mission.
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000 The next mission we did,
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000 I was not on.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000 And our guys went up down the street,
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000 I think from Falcon and other set and up over watch positions.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000 And, you know,
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000 they're, I think they're in the morning time and grenades come in.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000 You know, I think they had one or two grenades come in.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000 They all grenades,
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000 the guys are diving down the stairs and we had two guys get fragged from those.
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000 And from that point,
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000 it was like, all right,
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000 you know, we knew we were getting into, but then it's like,
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000 now it's real.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000 You know, now our guys are getting injured.
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000 We knew we were going to get wounded.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000 Now you got two guys moving with frags.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000 And their injuries weren't bad enough.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000 They had to get mad about it out.
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000 So they stayed with us, you know,
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000 and talking about three weeks to heal up in their,
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000 they were okay.
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000 And that was like your second op.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000 Yep.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000 That was like our second one.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 Yeah.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Yeah.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Yeah.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000 And then, you know, throughout that thing there,
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000 you know, one of the things I realized,
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000 and this is further down the road,
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000 but we did this, this river often.
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000 We're going to set support setting up a combat outpost.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000 And we're using the marine river.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000 Yeah.
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000 You know,
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000 and they're awesome.
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000 But think out funny that is like,
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000 maybe they're supposed to deliver the marine's, the other marine's are deliver enough.
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000 And they were good dudes, man.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000 They were down there.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:35.000 They were awesome.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000 They were square away.
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000 So they take us down river.
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000 And we had all of our deep conflicts and up payers.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000 When we get this point in the water,
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000 call it to the security army security check point up ahead.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000 Make sure everything's dialed in.
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000 Went through all the procedures.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000 And there was obviously a disconnect.
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000 So we get close to where we're going.
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000 And we can see the security position off to the right.
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000 And it's on a two story building.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000 And we get that.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000 And we get that.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000 And we're like,
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000 that's not good.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000 That's around coming over our head from the security position.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000 And then we're like,
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000 like your strobes do your shit.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000 And then the boat starts speeding up a little bit to get us to shore.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.000 And like,
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000 Now we're all pissed because we just got shot at it.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000 And then we get the.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000 You know,
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000 like,
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000 for a can traders are coming over.
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000 So we're like,
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000 you can get us to the shoreline, man.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000 So we get to the shoreline.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000 And we're dumping out at that point.
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000 It's a full on.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000 Dude, I just got chills.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000 Right.
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000 He's got chills.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000 Because when you're talking about your received fire from
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000 the friendlies,
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000 it's really uncorrible.
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000 And then it's a full on.
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000 We're not shooting back.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000 Yeah.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000 But then it's full on.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000 They think we're moved in boats coming down the river.
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000 And it's just.
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000 We're dumping off in the tolies.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000 And I'm I'm freaking hot, man.
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000 So I'm dumping in the side of the tolies.
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000 And we learned from you guys.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.000 Hey,
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000 Do you conflict that with your white star cluster?
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000 So I had all trusty right here.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000 You know,
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000 and as I'm going to the shoreline,
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000 I'm popping this thing out.
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000 My weapons flying all over the place.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000 And I'm yelling at the A O I C.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000 I was like, Hey,
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000 freaking call back to your get this shit.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000 You conflicted now.
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000 And I'm pissed.
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000 I'm yelling at him.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000 I'm yelling.
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000 I'm like, what the after you think I'm doing?
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000 What the after you think I'm doing?
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000 I'm like, fucking hurry up, man.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000 And so we're yelling back and forth.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000 And popping up the white star cluster.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000 And it of course, as soon as you get the white star
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000 cluster up,
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000 the shit stops.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000 Yeah.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000 But I couldn't get to that damn thing fast enough.
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000 By the time I got it,
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000 I had it out.
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000 Probably like less than 30 seconds.
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000 Dude,
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000 30 seconds of long time to be receiving fire from
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000 American machine gunners.
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000 Yeah, we were all sucking my advice.
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000 It was a good lesson learned.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000 One of the things with the body is when you go
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000 into a high stress environment.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000 There's multiple units in the area.
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000 The likelihood of you having a blue on blue.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000 You just go up drastically.
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000 You know, you've done a lot of podcasts with a
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000 Vietnam shit.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000 So when you're in those type of environments,
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000 you've got to have your deconstruction down.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000 You can't do it enough.
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000 Really.
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000 And you know, another thing I've been thinking about
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000 is from a leadership perspective.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000 A thing that I've been talking about all the time is like,
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000 if you work for me,
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000 and I come to talk to you,
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000 I got to understand what your perspective is.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000 I got to understand that.
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000 So that I can like,
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000 okay, he's reacting like this because of that.
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000 And even more in depth than that,
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000 I got to kind of know what your freaking story is.
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000 So I can't just know your perspective.
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000 I got to know what your story is.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000 Oh, this is Steve. He's he's been here for 20 years.
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000 He's he's done a good job.
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000 He also is known for having a bad temper.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000 He also has some trouble at home right now.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000 So I got to know this stuff.
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000 Yeah.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000 So that I can assess like,
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000 okay, what approach am I going to take?
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000 What reaction am I going to get?
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000 Well, guess what?
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000 When you're in a combat situation,
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000 you better think about the perspective of the people
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000 that you're working with.
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000 Yeah.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000 Because guess what?
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000 The kid that's 18 years old,
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000 he's scared shitless.
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000 He doesn't he he's freaking sick of being on this post.
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000 He's afraid he's going to get killed.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000 He's not being briefed by his seniors.
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000 He's tired.
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000 He's pissed off.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000 He's got an itchy trigger finger.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000 And what do you think this guy's going to do?
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000 Yeah.
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000 He's going to shoot at you.
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000 Yeah.
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000 If you don't make it clear, what's happening?
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000 Yeah.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000 So it's important to remember that.
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000 When you have to understand other people's perspective,
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000 and understand what their story is,
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000 and then you need to account for that somehow.
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000 Otherwise bad things happen.
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000 And like that's a nightmare, man.
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000 Like if those, those, those know protection on those surf boats.
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000 I mean, you're, if that, if one,
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000 one iteration of fire hit those surf boats,
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000 you'd have three, four guys dead wounded, whatever.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000 Maybe more.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000 Yep.
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000 You got 10 guys in a boat.
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000 Damn, it's a nightmare.
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000 Yeah.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000 It wasn't good. I didn't just talk about perspective.
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000 I know the army guys.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000 There were a couple units there that, you know,
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000 they'd been there for like eight months.
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000 I want to say like eight months.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000 And then they get the call.
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000 Hey, you're going to stay like three more months.
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000 Oh, yeah.
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000 And then dudes are wore out, man.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000 I mean, they're pulling security out front,
01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000 they're taking round RPG rounds.
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000 They've lost two,
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000 they're friends,
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000 three other friends for their friends.
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000 They've seen VBIDs go in.
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000 Yeah.
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000 They've heard rumors about boats.
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000 I mean,
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000 yeah.
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000 And look, the army guys and the Marines that were there,
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000 the most professional badass dudes ever.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000 Yeah.
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000 Ever.
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000 But there's a lot of them.
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000 Yeah.
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000 And if you have, look,
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000 you can have a platoon of 40 guys and 39 of them.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000 Can be the most square to weigh guys.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000 You've ever met and can understand everything and become cool and collected.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000 But there's going to be one person in there.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000 That's not.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000 Yeah.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000 And once one person starts shooting,
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000 bro.
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000 Yeah.
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000 It's a real problem to get.
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000 It's a real problem.
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000 I think other people aren't going to start shooting as well.
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000 That's that's what we literally get trained to do.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000 Oh, if there's a contact start shooting,
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000 help your buddy.
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000 Yeah.
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000 Not, uh,
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000 not good.
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000 Understandable,
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000 but not, not a good situation.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000 We definitely get a better job on that with us.
01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000 Um,
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000 Yeah.
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000 Wasn't good.
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000 We're lucky.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000 No one got in on that one.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000 Yeah.
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000 We had one other blue on blue that I know about.
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000 There's, there's, there's, I'm a convention.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000 It's probably quite a few blue on blues going on.
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000 You just don't, you don't know.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000 Um, there was, because I was, I was,
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000 we're talking about this with the brigade commander all the time.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000 There was one, there was usually one blue on blue per day per day.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000 Yeah.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000 But that, that wouldn't get reported.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000 And there was a one blue on blue per week that actually got reported.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.000 Yeah.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000 Of like, hey, we were taking fire from this unit at this time.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000 Most of them was like, hey,
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000 I've got a few fire, she's fire.
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000 You know, that's friendly position like that happened,
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000 all the, it happened once a day.
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:41.000 Yeah.
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000 One to day, you know, usually at night.
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000 But the, the most harrowing example of that was
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000 there was a blue on blue between humvies.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000 Like one humvie at night saw another humvie and started shooting.
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:53.000 Yeah.
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000 And there wasn't no mouss that had humvies.
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000 Yeah.
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000 Like at least the boat, the boats weren't super common to be in the river.
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000 Even the Marine Corps boats.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000 They weren't super common to be in the river.
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.76 roll about. Some goes, oh wait a second. I don't know what this is. This might be
01:46:05.76 --> 01:46:10.68 moust boats. Let's shoot a, but a humvee. Like that's how itchy the trigger
01:46:10.68 --> 01:46:13.80 fingers can get. And you got to understand people's perspective, man. We were so
01:46:13.80 --> 01:46:18.44 freaking paranoid about that stuff. Yeah. It was, uh, it wasn't a good feeling. That's
01:46:18.44 --> 01:46:22.20 for sure. Geez. There's nothing you can't, like, what are you going to do?
01:46:22.20 --> 01:46:26.20 Shoot back? No, like you can't do that. No. Yeah. You've grabbed that damn
01:46:26.20 --> 01:46:32.32 white star cluster and get fired off. Boy. Damn. We had one of the blue
01:46:32.32 --> 01:46:37.96 we were out there earlier down there by Grant. Com Grant. And we went to the
01:46:37.96 --> 01:46:41.84 unit, decinfilted everything. And, you know, our guys went out there and
01:46:41.84 --> 01:46:46.60 were getting set up on a rooftop and like, shoot. They come all
01:46:46.60 --> 01:46:53.48 manned. Yeah. You know what, one good. But, um, those high stress level areas
01:46:53.48 --> 01:46:56.48 people are getting wounded and shit. People are seeing different things.
01:46:56.48 --> 01:47:00.16 That's out there. It's real. You got to be careful. Yeah, when
01:47:00.16 --> 01:47:03.48 they've made a road extreme ownership, like we didn't plan to write. There's three
01:47:03.48 --> 01:47:07.76 chapters in there that are just blue on blue chapters. Yeah. Out of 12 chapters. Yeah.
01:47:07.76 --> 01:47:11.56 So, a quarter of the chapters are about blue on blue. Like, that's, we didn't
01:47:11.56 --> 01:47:14.40 think about that. But that's what the reality of the situation was.
01:47:14.40 --> 01:47:17.76 Those are some of the scariest. You know what's crazy? When we went back to
01:47:17.76 --> 01:47:22.64 trade that and we incorporated our, our laser gear. Oh, yeah. People found out how
01:47:22.64 --> 01:47:26.16 easy it is to, uh, blue on blue just to your point with perspectives. Like, we
01:47:26.16 --> 01:47:34.16 drew that out. It was awesome to draw that out and training. Um, yeah. So,
01:47:34.16 --> 01:47:38.72 you know, so after, you know, after those handful of ops, we had, uh, you
01:47:38.72 --> 01:47:42.88 know, we had no rubber 19. And so this is putting us, you know, right
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:46.64 before Thanksgiving and we had the whole task in or out. And so we had, uh,
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:51.12 you know, our crudged or guys are up in the papa, sectors are, are, are,
01:47:51.12 --> 01:47:57.36 are you, patoon is down. We're down past Grant. I think we're down past ground
01:47:57.36 --> 01:48:00.80 that area. We're about eight blocks from those guys. Half mile miles. Something
01:48:00.80 --> 01:48:06.56 like that. Maybe Julie, yet. Yeah, Julie at sector. Yeah. I don't remember
01:48:06.56 --> 01:48:10.000 all the sectors, but man, we're out there and things are going good. And like
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.80 eight o'clock in the morning, we're set up. We got mutually sporting
01:48:12.80 --> 01:48:15.60 positions with our patoon. They got mutually sporting, uh, supporting
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:18.56 positions with their patoon. Things are good. And I remember the first
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:21.52 thing was like, all right, this is going to be a shit chill in here. You know,
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:25.36 we had a car going around with the, the hazard zone, you know, so there's
01:48:25.36 --> 01:48:28.24 signally in the area. Hey, man, US troops are in there, but they didn't
01:48:28.24 --> 01:48:31.84 know where we're at. We didn't have any, you know, loopholes. We didn't
01:48:31.84 --> 01:48:35.76 pound out any, any, any brick or use explosives. So they had a hard time
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:39.28 figuring out where we were, they're out the whole day. But as we're sitting there
01:48:39.28 --> 01:48:42.32 thanks start heating up, you know, either's maims over two streets over
01:48:42.32 --> 01:48:45.12 and they're all consolidating one area. They got weapons. And then,
01:48:45.12 --> 01:48:47.60 you know, it's coming. We're going to get, we're going to get in the mix
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:52.56 here. And so like around 11 o'clock, we started calling in for our,
01:48:52.56 --> 01:48:55.84 our gimmlers, we're going to guided multiple launch wrong
01:48:55.84 --> 01:48:59.76 system. And we started getting not ready to
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:03.76 generate coordinates to bring in rockets because there's different
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:06.80 requirements. That wasn't coming from off the rails from the air.
01:49:06.80 --> 01:49:10.72 So it was easier to get it approved. And so as we're doing that, you know,
01:49:10.72 --> 01:49:14.24 we get a call over the radio, you know, that, you know, our other unit from
01:49:14.24 --> 01:49:17.04 Corrigator was hit. And we didn't know how bad they were hit, but, you know,
01:49:17.04 --> 01:49:20.56 the, the AOSC came on as I came in earlier, it's had these in bad,
01:49:20.56 --> 01:49:23.28 he's in bad shape. And so it was Joe, you know, and we're like, oh,
01:49:23.28 --> 01:49:26.48 shit, man. And, you know, they're taking them down to the cash and
01:49:26.48 --> 01:49:31.20 shit. Which wasn't good. And we're like, everyone just got a sick
01:49:31.20 --> 01:49:34.000 feeling into their stomach. You know, we didn't know what happened
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.48 until after we got back. But we're like, shit, he's going to make it. He's not
01:49:36.48 --> 01:49:38.88 going to make it. But, you know, those guys were in a position. They started
01:49:38.88 --> 01:49:42.88 taking light fire. And as they're taking light fire, you know, they had rooftop
01:49:42.88 --> 01:49:45.52 jumpers in a body. They'd get as close as they could. And they dump
01:49:45.52 --> 01:49:48.56 grenades right on top of your position. So the first thing that happened is
01:49:48.56 --> 01:49:52.96 that a grenade dumped on their position. And Ellie gets sliced in the dam,
01:49:52.96 --> 01:49:56.96 wrist pretty bad. So, you know, their collapse and off down off the rooftop. And
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:00.48 we had explosives up there. So the guys are clapping off explosives to, you
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:04.48 know, move the rooftop jumpers away from from their guys. So as they
01:50:04.48 --> 01:50:09.12 collapsed down into, you know, on the bottom floor, everything still
01:50:09.12 --> 01:50:12.48 on the control. There's a light ball in a fire. They're calling to the other,
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:16.16 the other sniper supporting element, A were hit. We're going to call in the next
01:50:16.16 --> 01:50:19.28 track. There's a calling the next track. You know, the, the, the, the
01:50:19.28 --> 01:50:24.08 Iraqis come out and our unit comes out to get in the Bradley's. And, you know,
01:50:24.08 --> 01:50:27.60 their hit was some type of white phosphorus explosive device. And I did a
01:50:27.60 --> 01:50:30.88 lot of analysis on it. What that was at a roadside bomb. What was it?
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:34.88 I can never determine what it was. But, you know, killed. I think three Iraqis
01:50:34.88 --> 01:50:38.96 wounded two are two guys. Our two seals were hit critically injured. You
01:50:38.96 --> 01:50:42.88 know, so now they're pulling everyone back into the house. The Bradley's
01:50:42.88 --> 01:50:46.64 are getting out of there because it's just a total shit show. The other
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:49.52 units fighting their way down the street to get in a position to help these
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:55.12 guys out by this by this time. In long story short, you know, everyone's in a
01:50:55.12 --> 01:50:56.64 bad position. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
01:50:56.64 --> 01:51:00.96 it was such a, uh, such a good dude. He's sitting there telling dudes. He's
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:04.40 cool comic collect. He's got shit burning on him. You know, burning through his
01:51:04.40 --> 01:51:07.44 camis and he's telling guys what to do to how to patch him up and do all
01:51:07.44 --> 01:51:11.68 this shit and he's jacked up. Um, you know, Joe, he had his legs kind of
01:51:11.68 --> 01:51:16.16 blown backwards on his lower extremities. So it's a complex situation. You know,
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:20.40 outside still heated up injured guys on the inside dead guys. Our own
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:23.76 dead guys. Our Iraqi troops out on the street. Guys fighting their ways
01:51:23.76 --> 01:51:28.16 back down. It's like, his bad as a situation is, is you can conjure up,
01:51:28.16 --> 01:51:31.92 right? You know, they get things under control that call in another
01:51:31.92 --> 01:51:35.28 quick-goer actionary force. They load these guys up. And, you know, and that's
01:51:35.28 --> 01:51:38.48 when we get the call over the radio that those guys have been hit. Meanwhile,
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:41.44 over on our sector things are starting to heat up. And so we're
01:51:41.44 --> 01:51:44.16 spinning up aircraft. We're trying to get our gimlers in
01:51:44.16 --> 01:51:47.28 position to start launching. And, you know, our guys are out there,
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:49.92 you know, laying down to made up fire and launching a few
01:51:49.92 --> 01:51:54.96 Carl Gustav rockets into some positions down there by us. But it was just, you know,
01:51:54.96 --> 01:51:58.96 shitty day for us, you know, obviously the whole task you know, was hit,
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:07.28 was hit hard on that. Wasn't good. Yeah. And, I mean, Elliot is probably
01:52:07.28 --> 01:52:12.56 one of the most severely wounded seals from the Iraq war. Yeah.
01:52:12.56 --> 01:52:18.72 Yeah. He's, I mean, he's freaking warrior. Yeah. But he, he took a heavy hit that day.
01:52:18.72 --> 01:52:23.20 Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, an Elliot story, you know, I got never quit. He never
01:52:23.20 --> 01:52:29.52 gave up on life. And, you know, he's going through physical therapy. And
01:52:29.52 --> 01:52:33.44 him and his physical therapist falling love. And, Elliot,
01:52:33.44 --> 01:52:38.16 merrier, they get married. They have kids. What you're just asked, you know, I've
01:52:38.16 --> 01:52:41.52 seen Elliot a handful of times over the years, you know, it
01:52:41.52 --> 01:52:46.48 buds graduations and stuff like that. You know, just sucks that shit. I'm
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:50.96 doing that. Yeah. And, and, and, life was super good friends with Elliot. And, you
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:55.36 know, obviously we had just all high five done the tarmac and said goodbye. And,
01:52:55.36 --> 01:52:59.12 and then the next thing the laves doing, he's down at the burn center. You know,
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:02.40 trying to try and give support to Elliot. You know, it's freaking,
01:53:03.84 --> 01:53:08.40 freaking rough man. That shit took the, uh, that took the wind out of
01:53:08.40 --> 01:53:11.52 our cell for the whole task. You know, you're just wondering like what the hell is
01:53:11.52 --> 01:53:15.68 going out? And, you see, so now we got two guys wounded with frags. You got
01:53:15.68 --> 01:53:19.52 Joe and Elliot with what they got going on. And, actually, the first week we were
01:53:19.52 --> 01:53:22.72 there, you know, we had Jimmy left over from you guys and you get to get shot. He
01:53:22.72 --> 01:53:29.20 gets a grayser. Crosses nipple. So, yeah, things were starting to stack up, man.
01:53:29.20 --> 01:53:32.32 You know, and Elliot was a unknown, what he wanted. Sure, if he was going to make it or
01:53:32.32 --> 01:53:37.68 not. Yeah, and I left October 21st and that was November 19th. So, you
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:41.84 guys, it only been on the ground without us for under a month. Yeah.
01:53:41.84 --> 01:53:44.96 Yep. And he had all this already stacked up. Yep. Yep.
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:51.92 Yeah. We, it's not to mention in a way you are writing in already with
01:53:51.92 --> 01:53:57.28 the mental fault of all of our casualties and our lost guys. Yeah. You know, so you
01:53:57.28 --> 01:54:03.36 already know that this is just the way. Yeah. Yeah. We had, uh, you know, so we
01:54:03.36 --> 01:54:09.12 get past November 19th. We're kind of re-organ and things are starting to
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:12.16 change at that point. I can't remember if it was November December, but you
01:54:12.16 --> 01:54:16.08 know, we had one of the tribes out there that al-Qaida come in and they
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:20.96 killed a couple of their tribes. And they were like, F al-Qaida, we want to come over to the
01:54:20.96 --> 01:54:25.28 you know, US side. And that was a big tip and point out there, a
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:29.52 correct order. I forget the name of the tribe out there. But the guys went out there
01:54:29.52 --> 01:54:32.32 and they're meeting up with the shake and they're local guys and it was a
01:54:32.32 --> 01:54:36.32 weird situation. Because at that point, those guys were dropping motors on
01:54:36.32 --> 01:54:39.84 correct order. So, there's this friction like I freaking help and these dudes out,
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:42.88 they want to join us now. They're just, you know, the other day they're dropping
01:54:42.88 --> 01:54:49.20 motors on us, you know. So that was, that was, that was interesting. And then
01:54:49.20 --> 01:54:55.68 December timeframe, we'd set up, uh, I think was right before Christmas. We're up
01:54:55.68 --> 01:54:59.20 there around racetrack and the Marine Corps didn't a big huge push
01:54:59.20 --> 01:55:02.48 in through to clear out that whole area. That area was still pretty much
01:55:02.48 --> 01:55:05.36 contested when you guys were there. And that was an area we'd operate
01:55:05.36 --> 01:55:09.76 in quite a bit. And so we're out there for like, I don't know, three, four days. And this
01:55:09.76 --> 01:55:12.96 is right before Christmas time. We think we're going to be out there past
01:55:12.96 --> 01:55:17.20 Christmas. And a couple of events there like the the moves there were so good at
01:55:17.20 --> 01:55:20.56 using dead space. You know, I remember we're on a two-story building. We got
01:55:20.56 --> 01:55:24.32 Marine Corps sniper's in position. We're in position. We're spread out. And
01:55:24.32 --> 01:55:27.60 I go to use the bathroom and I'm looking out this window and there's a tank
01:55:27.60 --> 01:55:32.48 down in my corner. And a dude slips out of dead space with an RPG in like
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:36.24 moves. Boom. He clocks that thing off in under three seconds, melts back
01:55:36.24 --> 01:55:40.32 away. And you're like, even if I was on my gun, I don't think I had enough time to
01:55:40.32 --> 01:55:44.88 shoot that guy. We had a couple clothes calls in that area. You know, they
01:55:44.88 --> 01:55:49.20 had some snipers in vehicles. And so in muffled the sound, you couldn't tell
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:52.88 where they were coming from. You know, and when, uh, you know, I took a
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:57.12 damn shot and through our position right at the 12 o'clock. So, you know,
01:55:57.12 --> 01:56:01.52 we got our loophole set up and around 762 by 54 big one punches all the
01:56:01.52 --> 01:56:04.72 way through the wall. Right at the 12 o'clock position. So the guy's dead
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:09.04 center trying to get into our whole where we're at. And I just remember
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:12.96 thinking, damn man, that's whoever shot that. That's a good shot. That's not,
01:56:12.96 --> 01:56:19.28 you know, some JB dude making that shot. Um, and as I got to tell
01:56:19.28 --> 01:56:22.16 this story, I forgot about this one, but we had our country boy,
01:56:22.16 --> 01:56:24.88 old Charlie, he's out now. So I'll say his name on it out. But Charlie,
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:30.16 we're on the, this is all in this three, four day period. And uh,
01:56:30.16 --> 01:56:34.32 we're on the rooftop. And that's the same day that I take that round and through the 12 o'clock
01:56:34.32 --> 01:56:40.24 position. And there's moves doing a center peel down the street. And so like I'm here,
01:56:40.24 --> 01:56:44.16 Charlie's position is over here with his crew. And we got a pilot up over
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:47.36 hand and he's like, hey, you got some, you got bad guys coming down the street
01:56:47.36 --> 01:56:50.16 towards you. And you know, Charlie's just a good old country boy. He's like
01:56:50.16 --> 01:56:56.64 Roger that, you know, he's like, fire out. He dumps a flag. And it like,
01:56:56.64 --> 01:57:00.72 hit, I don't know how he does. He throws a flag in the blind. Those are down on the street.
01:57:00.72 --> 01:57:04.64 It hits in between where these moves are right. And the pilots more excited than any
01:57:04.64 --> 01:57:08.72 police. I guess I got to direct it. And so I don't direct it. And I'm like,
01:57:08.72 --> 01:57:11.84 talking to Charlie, what do you do? So I was just popmarked right in through it.
01:57:11.84 --> 01:57:16.32 I'll throw you know, I'll just rock Roger that dude. So you guys, you guys were
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:21.04 getting an aircraft overhead inside the city. Yeah, we, you know, on the
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:25.92 daily, God hit, we had a, I don't know, as a 14 or 15. Okay, fast movers. Yeah,
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:30.24 fast. You are getting heels. Where are you? No. Yeah. I don't remember having any
01:57:30.24 --> 01:57:34.80 heels. There to be too slow. Yeah, the heels wouldn't come in for us,
01:57:36.40 --> 01:57:40.40 because that reason they want to freaking black lockdown scenario on the fold,
01:57:40.40 --> 01:57:46.16 which, which would have. Yeah, the Apache's came in one time. And they left and didn't come back.
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:50.80 Yeah, they got, they got lit up like it was crazy. It was an crazy amount of volume of fire.
01:57:50.80 --> 01:57:54.64 We were putting it in a combat outpost. And they came in. They said they want to
01:57:54.64 --> 01:58:01.44 support. They flew in and it was like, it was crazy. Yeah. They flew away and didn't come back.
01:58:01.44 --> 01:58:05.20 We, man, things were so confusing over there. I remember being out there in positions. And
01:58:05.20 --> 01:58:10.96 now we had, you know, these two young ladies and they're doing clothes, they're hanging clothes.
01:58:10.96 --> 01:58:15.44 And then this other, what looks like the lady comes out there and she's like laying clothes out.
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:20.40 But the third person that came out late, they're just looking everywhere. They're looking
01:58:20.40 --> 01:58:24.40 for us. And it was a dude just like a woman. You know, they got the garb over their head. So
01:58:24.40 --> 01:58:27.84 you can't even tell. But he's constantly looking, look, and look, and look, and the girls are
01:58:27.84 --> 01:58:33.04 gigland because it's, you know, it's kind of funny of them. I was like, it took me a long time to put that
01:58:34.32 --> 01:58:38.08 picture together, what transpired. And I couldn't do it while I was in the field. You know,
01:58:38.08 --> 01:58:41.92 I was like, it was just weird. I'm like, all right, that had to been a dude trying to find our
01:58:41.92 --> 01:58:47.44 position and stress as a woman. And these dudes were just, they were cagey, man. We're out there
01:58:47.44 --> 01:58:52.96 in the pop of sect on another mission. And it's mean another dude and we're set up in the hole.
01:58:52.96 --> 01:58:58.40 And I remember I'm looking in a guy's looking at looking directly at us. But he's got like a
01:58:58.40 --> 01:59:02.08 three or four year old girl right next to him. But he's looking in our direction. I'm like,
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:06.24 that shouldn't right. But he's got no gun. He's like two, three hundred yards away. I'm keeping
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:11.76 my on him. Watching, watching, watching, watching nothing happens. Me and the other guy rotate out of
01:59:11.76 --> 01:59:15.44 the hole. He gets in there and shit five minutes after he gets in the hole. We just started,
01:59:15.44 --> 01:59:19.44 you know, get, get, get, get into the hole, man. And like I'm young. Let's do a lot of there.
01:59:19.44 --> 01:59:23.92 You know, he rolls out, but they're shit flying everywhere. You know, and we're like, damn,
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:28.56 that was close. Look at that dude. And you get it. You know? But that guy was spotting with his daughter.
01:59:29.12 --> 01:59:34.80 Yeah. If it even was his daughter. Yeah. Oh, yes. Spotting with a child. Spotting grabbed out.
01:59:34.80 --> 01:59:39.44 So, yeah, hold my hand. Come over here. Boom. Yeah. And if the guy had a gun,
01:59:40.80 --> 01:59:44.000 I had a felt comfortable taking the shop. But he doesn't have anything. So you're just like,
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.68 is this just more weird shit going on over here? There's somebody weird thing going on. Yeah.
01:59:47.68 --> 01:59:51.28 There's always been all the weird inexplicable things that are happening all the time.
01:59:51.28 --> 01:59:56.64 Yeah. And they're all looking freaking crazy suspicious. Yeah. I mean, we had a ISR asset one time
01:59:56.64 --> 02:00:02.96 over, go flying overhead. Like there's a fast mover or something. And he's like, okay, we got,
02:00:02.96 --> 02:00:06.96 we got a vehicle pulling up. Like we got a vehicle. So everyone's looking at this vehicle. I'm looking
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:12.96 at this vehicle on the ISR screen. And like, it's this, this looks super suspect. They're stopping.
02:00:12.96 --> 02:00:16.72 They're looking around. They get out. Yeah. Open the trunk. All right. Oh, they're opening the trunk.
02:00:16.72 --> 02:00:21.60 You know, everyone's on this mode. And then the reaching the point, something out, the point,
02:00:21.60 --> 02:00:25.28 something out. The point out. The point out an object right now. And sure enough, like,
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:28.88 everyone's all excited and thinking, this is like, we need to drop a bomb on this thing. And sure
02:00:28.88 --> 02:00:34.24 enough, they got out of jack out of the thing and jacked up their freaking car and changed the tire
02:00:34.24 --> 02:00:39.20 and put it all away and left. And like they tracked them, they're, they left. They weren't,
02:00:39.20 --> 02:00:47.44 it wasn't like a setup, you know? And, and man, it's so difficult to decipher what's
02:00:47.44 --> 02:00:54.72 really happening. And you get better at it. But it's a tough war to fight. You know, it's a tough
02:00:54.72 --> 02:00:58.56 war to fight. You know, like, I don't know what we turned over with you guys. You always talked about the
02:00:58.56 --> 02:01:03.44 hey, it was a good shoot, bad result. Hey, what they're doing is lined up with the enemy
02:01:03.44 --> 02:01:10.08 procedures. You build the story and you make the best decision you can with what you're looking at.
02:01:10.80 --> 02:01:14.40 And sometimes just your point. It's actually legitimate. But you don't know that, you know?
02:01:14.40 --> 02:01:21.04 Yeah, well, that was something I learned and stole from the first the 506 because we had,
02:01:21.60 --> 02:01:26.000 or they, when we, when we first got there and we were over with them and they had some one of
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.08 their guys shot and killed somebody and they were like, the person was out.
02:01:30.08 --> 02:01:35.36 I forget what suspicious activity they were doing. But it was like they were digging a hole on the
02:01:35.36 --> 02:01:40.24 side of the road and they shot, killed the guy and then they sent a team out there to inspect and he was
02:01:40.24 --> 02:01:45.44 whatever, you know, he was planting a plant. I don't know what he was doing. But it was something that
02:01:45.44 --> 02:01:52.40 was not the activity that that the shooter thought it was. Yeah. And I was talking to their
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:56.000 ops officer and he was like, hey, you know what, this is a, this is a good shot, bad result,
02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.52 meaning that the, our soldier was following the proper rules of engagement. And it turns out that
02:02:04.24 --> 02:02:09.92 the result of that shot is bad, even though the shot was good, the result was bad. And, you know,
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:15.68 it bothers me so much when I hear people talk about, you know, these, the US military, you know,
02:02:15.68 --> 02:02:20.24 causing all these civilian casualties, man, we go through such great lengths to prevent civilian
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:28.000 casualties and put our soldiers, sailors, airmen of a marine at such risk to prevent those
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.52 casualties to civilian casualties from happen happening. But it does happen. That's the reality
02:02:33.52 --> 02:02:37.84 that it's going to happen. And that's why if you're going to go to war, you better be ready for that.
02:02:37.84 --> 02:02:42.32 Yeah. You can't go to war thinking, oh, yeah, don't worry. We won't kill any civilians. Like,
02:02:42.32 --> 02:02:48.24 no, if you go to war, you're killing civilians. Yeah. I'm trying to think I know in the other
02:02:48.24 --> 02:02:52.96 deployments I did over there. We started doing a lot of collateral damage assessments before we
02:02:52.96 --> 02:02:56.80 did anything. I don't remember doing that one. We're in Romadi. Like, because we weren't really
02:02:56.80 --> 02:03:04.000 dropping bombs. And there was mostly just ground, um, ground units, handling business, you know,
02:03:04.96 --> 02:03:10.000 but anyways, that, that became a factor later on. Sure, everything was a CD. Yeah. I mean, even
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.20 even even when I relieved you and Baghdad, we started looking at collateral damage in terms of
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:19.60 like breaching. Yeah. Like, okay, we're going to breach this building. What's the collateral damage?
02:03:19.60 --> 02:03:24.88 Could we hurt someone? Yeah. Can we, are we going to ruin this? You know, how many, how many
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:28.40 wind shields are we going, or how many wind does in this neighborhood are we going to blow out
02:03:28.40 --> 02:03:35.36 with this explosive breaching charge? And what good does that do for our overall strategic mission here
02:03:35.36 --> 02:03:39.60 if we're the assholes that come in every night and blow up everyone's house and windows, right?
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:44.56 Yeah. All of a sudden, we're not cool. Yeah. So sometimes it was like, oh, okay, well,
02:03:44.56 --> 02:03:47.52 maybe we shouldn't explicitly breach well, then how are you going to execute the mission?
02:03:47.52 --> 02:03:51.20 And what risk does it put the troops at? Yeah. Because the safest way to do a direct action
02:03:51.20 --> 02:03:55.92 mission is to explosively breach the shit out of them. Yeah. Yeah. Shock everyone in the building.
02:03:55.92 --> 02:04:03.04 And by, okay, cool. So there's other tactics that we had to develop to to mitigate the risk. But
02:04:03.04 --> 02:04:08.000 what I'm saying is we were taking risks for sure to try and mitigate and not just us every,
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.72 I'm going to say, we, I mean, the US military at large,
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:18.32 mitigates risk of civilian casualties by risking our own casualties. That's what we do.
02:04:19.36 --> 02:04:24.16 And even as much as we mitigate them, we can't mitigate them all. And civilians are going to die.
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:31.52 So you need to think about that. Yeah. So how to, when you guys had that horrific incident with
02:04:31.52 --> 02:04:37.36 Elliot and Joe, then what? Then like, how did the rest of the deployment? And I know that you guys,
02:04:37.36 --> 02:04:42.40 so one thing that's really positive is, part of this transition, I don't even know if you knew this.
02:04:42.40 --> 02:04:50.56 So we were doing everything we could. We, that whole sons of Ambar and that whole thing started when
02:04:50.56 --> 02:04:56.88 we were there. And then the other thing we were trying to do is we were trying to get the Iraqi police
02:04:56.88 --> 02:05:04.000 force built up. And we just started to get it built as we left. And so you guys got the benefit
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:11.04 of the Iraqi police force, all of a sudden, the local Iraqi police force was respected. They were
02:05:11.04 --> 02:05:16.32 manned. They had, they, they understood the neighborhoods. They were tribal, most of the guys were
02:05:16.32 --> 02:05:23.84 tribal guys. And so all of a sudden, over a very quick period of time, the, the violence went down a lot.
02:05:23.84 --> 02:05:28.72 Joe, absolutely. Absolutely. I remember the police became a huge factor. I think it was late
02:05:28.72 --> 02:05:33.44 January, early February for us. They came in. They were setting up their own police stations and combat
02:05:33.44 --> 02:05:39.04 outpost. But man, then they were targeted by a queue. You may need to head police chief. They're trying
02:05:39.04 --> 02:05:45.44 to car bomb him and his entire family. They eventually got him. But it was, it was rough. And it
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:52.96 definitely settled down everything. I would say, and by the, you know, mid, mid January to February,
02:05:52.96 --> 02:05:57.68 somewhere in there is where things really settled and good. Where, hey, the attacks are going
02:05:57.68 --> 02:06:02.88 way down. You know, we're still getting the occasional ID, you know, ID at him, you know, an army,
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:09.60 silver affairs. They're going down to freaking Falcon and boom, they hit an ID killed our full
02:06:09.60 --> 02:06:15.92 people. Oh, yeah, that was, that was Travis Patrickwin. And he was a freaking epic guy. That, and that
02:06:15.92 --> 02:06:22.32 was a major McClellan, the female Marine Corps officer. Because they were there when I was there.
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:28.16 They were both just freaking awesome. Awesome. Just awesome. Unbelievable. That was such a freaking
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:33.68 horrific situation. Yeah, absolutely horrible. But thanks definitely die down there towards,
02:06:33.68 --> 02:06:40.72 you know, January, February, time, prime. It was in a good place. Then you read a poll. You came
02:06:40.72 --> 02:06:44.72 back to America. Came back to America in boom. I'm going to work for Jockel Willi.
02:06:44.72 --> 02:06:52.24 It's raining. Rolled in the trade that man. And that was, um, that was awesome. Yeah. That was awesome.
02:06:52.24 --> 02:06:55.84 Did you, did you volunteer to come there or what happened? How did you guys so before the
02:06:55.84 --> 02:07:00.000 plumbing, I know I was working with our group CMC and they were doing team level detailing.
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.20 So he came in. He's like, hey, man, what do you want to do? I was like, well, I want to stay
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:06.80 out. I want to stay in the area. He's like, what would you think about going to trade? I was like,
02:07:06.80 --> 02:07:10.40 keep me in the area. He was like, yeah, I was like, hell, yeah, I'll do it. So Roger that, man.
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:16.40 I was looking forward to, you know, and you know, the guy I really do with their BJs is a good
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:22.72 dude smart and I think he set up a good foundation with what he had. So I inherited a really
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:29.92 a good product. Yeah. He was doing good shit. Yeah, no, it was, it was legit. And then you showed up.
02:07:29.92 --> 02:07:38.08 It was awesome. And then I mean, what was your experience of trade at like in terms of C now?
02:07:38.08 --> 02:07:44.32 This is interesting. You know, I told you that like the seeds of my experience in knowledge were
02:07:44.32 --> 02:07:51.28 watered heavily and fertilized heavily, but I was young. So now you get to experience this in a much
02:07:52.48 --> 02:07:57.04 in a much more powerful environment because the training we were conducting was so much more advanced.
02:07:58.48 --> 02:08:03.12 Then and also you were more advanced and you were a combat veteran of multiple combat
02:08:03.12 --> 02:08:08.64 tours and you were a senior and listed guy. So man, it was just, it was awesome. It was a good experience.
02:08:08.64 --> 02:08:11.92 But I'll tell you what I went in there and I'm like, holy, it's different when you're
02:08:12.72 --> 02:08:18.16 responsible for a live fire range versus you're going through a live fire range.
02:08:19.04 --> 02:08:23.52 And so there was, there was a lot to that, you know, the most stressful thing for me during
02:08:23.52 --> 02:08:27.68 land warfare was doing all the live fire training because there was definitely a lot of opportunity
02:08:27.68 --> 02:08:32.96 for someone to get injured or wounded, you know, you know what I mean. And so it was good
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:37.68 and getting up there and teaching these things, you just learned so much more. I mean, the pipeline
02:08:37.68 --> 02:08:42.96 should be, we need guys and instructor positions, but you need them a budget. You also need them over
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:49.60 at our trade at that. If there was a way to split that where they do 15 months, it bugs, 15 months
02:08:49.60 --> 02:08:55.44 a trade, it would be ideal. It's just, it's not practical, you know. But going to trade, it was an
02:08:55.44 --> 02:09:01.68 eye open. And I really started, you know, I'd say around 2003 I started 2003-2004,
02:09:01.68 --> 02:09:06.32 started reading quite a bit. I never heard of the last hundred yards. You know, we didn't have
02:09:06.32 --> 02:09:10.64 a portal with libraries. We didn't have guys going around if you went in a training so you might see it.
02:09:11.36 --> 02:09:16.48 But I really started building up a good reading block. And I remember talking to you when we're at
02:09:16.48 --> 02:09:21.68 trade at, and we were reading, I think I just went through the maneuver of warfare handbook. And I was like,
02:09:21.68 --> 02:09:27.20 man, I'm thinking these things. And then you read it in a reinforces what you were thinking. So
02:09:27.20 --> 02:09:33.20 not, now your confidence just goes through the roof. And I think one of the things we did good in
02:09:34.08 --> 02:09:38.48 in a stubby of continues to do this is developing our future leaders. I mean, think about when
02:09:38.48 --> 02:09:42.80 you and I came up with it. There was no portal, there was no none of this stuff. We've got stuff
02:09:42.80 --> 02:09:47.52 hanging. Hey, you want to be a good tactical leader, leader, go read your doctrine, go read these
02:09:47.52 --> 02:09:51.92 books here, and that is going to boost you up. And the guys that are hungry, they're going to
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:55.44 go in there and read it. The guys that are, you know, a little bit lax a days ago and they don't want to
02:09:55.44 --> 02:09:59.28 do it. They're going to meet the minimum standard. But you definitely need to have something out there
02:09:59.28 --> 02:10:04.88 to wear, you know, your high performers are hungry, give it to them so that they can become,
02:10:06.08 --> 02:10:10.56 a better leader. So I think we did that good, but just going back to land war for, I think,
02:10:10.56 --> 02:10:14.96 you know, the stress levels, they were high during a life-iron training, the field training exercises
02:10:14.96 --> 02:10:20.64 we did were just badass were building, you know, little wood huts all over the dam place on those ranges.
02:10:20.64 --> 02:10:26.000 And I think the guys, you know, I mean, shit, we had a thermal camera out there at one point and we're
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.76 video tape in the guys coming in so they come back and go through their debrief, we're going,
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:33.60 this is what you all look like. Here's what we're telling you. Here's what you look like and the people
02:10:33.60 --> 02:10:37.12 see what they look like. They go damn check, Roger that, you know, they're making some adjustments.
02:10:38.08 --> 02:10:42.24 But I thought it was good. I was definitely learning a lot while was there. I wish I had
02:10:42.24 --> 02:10:48.80 a done that assignment earlier on in, in at least a team five training. So I would have boosted me up a lot,
02:10:48.80 --> 02:10:56.16 you know, what did you see? What did you notice from the, I mean, the crazy thing about it is you get
02:10:56.16 --> 02:11:04.56 to, it's the best lat, I truly think this. I think that that land warfare training is the best
02:11:04.56 --> 02:11:08.40 leadership laboratory in the world. I think that's it. I don't think there's a better leadership
02:11:08.40 --> 02:11:14.40 laboratory where you can see leadership in action. I really don't because you get the whole dynamic,
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:22.40 someone might say, well, you know, in some business or in some bureaucratic situation or some
02:11:22.40 --> 02:11:26.000 boardroom, you get that part too because you get the mission planning that's taking place. And
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.72 there's no gunfire going on during the mission planning, but you get the stress that you get the
02:11:30.72 --> 02:11:34.48 people that have to make decisions, you get the team arguing with each other, and you get the
02:11:34.48 --> 02:11:40.000 different personalities that are coming out. And so you get to watch all this and you get to learn and
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.32 you get to see how people react and you get to see human nature over and over and over again.
02:11:44.32 --> 02:11:51.36 And you get to see one puttune do it. And then you see another puttune do the same thing. The same,
02:11:51.36 --> 02:11:57.60 I mean, we had all those little pet nickmames for all the different maneuvers that we knew that
02:11:57.60 --> 02:12:04.48 our moush was going to do. And we, so you'd see a puttune go through the octopus, you'd see a puttune
02:12:04.48 --> 02:12:11.04 go through the corner of death, right? You'd see the trail of tears. You'd get to see how they would
02:12:11.04 --> 02:12:16.24 react and you'd see what a good leader would do. And you'd see how that would turn the puttune and
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:21.20 all the sudden they'd be able to get things together and survive and make it happen and do a good
02:12:21.20 --> 02:12:25.60 job. And you'd see bad leadership. And you'd go, well, these guys are just going to be a
02:12:25.60 --> 02:12:34.24 suffer fest. And so that that leadership laboratory was just unbelievably powerful. And really,
02:12:34.24 --> 02:12:40.72 it was, it was powerful for for us as instructors because we were detached and we got to watch it.
02:12:40.72 --> 02:12:46.16 Look, the troops, Abby, obviously, get a ton out of it too. But getting to see it over and over again
02:12:46.16 --> 02:12:53.92 was just ridiculous amount of learning. One of the things I, I really respected about land warfare,
02:12:54.56 --> 02:12:59.20 you got to see people's true character when they're coming through there, they're up late at night,
02:12:59.20 --> 02:13:03.68 you're under a lot of stress, whatever you're thinking in your head or whatever type of attitude
02:13:03.68 --> 02:13:07.68 you have, good or bad, that's coming out. And you really get to see what you're working with with
02:13:07.68 --> 02:13:14.000 your pertune, you know. And that's a good precursor because when you go to combat, if you end up
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.40 going on deployment and you end up getting in real combat, you're going to see that, that's the only
02:13:18.40 --> 02:13:22.96 place that's going to come out even more is when you go into combat, people start acting crazy.
02:13:22.96 --> 02:13:27.04 Like, and I'm not talking about hey, and gunfight, there, and I'm talking about on a day-to-day
02:13:27.04 --> 02:13:32.32 basis, you start seeing what their character is. They do, they want to operate, do, they want to
02:13:32.32 --> 02:13:36.80 hide, do, they will, like you get to see, start to see all that stuff. And you'll see it,
02:13:36.80 --> 02:13:42.32 you'll see it out in the desert, in training, you'll see people start to crack, and you'll also see
02:13:42.32 --> 02:13:46.64 people step up and you'll see people start to lead and you see people that are tough. And when you
02:13:46.64 --> 02:13:50.32 see those good leaders coming through and look, the good leader could be anyone in the platoon from
02:13:50.32 --> 02:13:58.40 an E5 to the platoon or the task unit commander, anyone in between, you have one good leader or two
02:13:58.40 --> 02:14:04.08 good leaders in there and they're going to do a good job. They can be countered by bad leadership.
02:14:04.08 --> 02:14:10.08 So you can have a good leader that gets countered by someone that's an ego jackass and they that
02:14:10.08 --> 02:14:14.80 ego jackass can actually ruin everything. Sometimes if you just have one good leader, that's the
02:14:14.80 --> 02:14:20.48 LPL of one platoon, and he's a really good sol leader, he can carry the whole task unit.
02:14:21.52 --> 02:14:26.96 Now if you put a jackass, just seen your chief in there, a jackass chief or a jackass lieutenant,
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:33.68 he can he can override two or three squared away leaders because he's a knucklehead and doesn't
02:14:33.68 --> 02:14:38.40 want a lesson and wants to do everything his way and wants to let his ego run the show.
02:14:38.40 --> 02:14:45.28 The freaking disaster. Yeah, we saw quite a few good leaders come through, probably the most
02:14:45.28 --> 02:14:49.28 rewarding thing, having guys come through training, they're coming through, they're just starting out
02:14:50.40 --> 02:14:54.40 as a unit. They're figuring out some things out if they haven't been through another block
02:14:54.96 --> 02:15:00.16 and they come in and the growth that you see, that you're providing as instructors and you know
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:05.28 as a cadre, as a unit and you see him start here and by the time they finish after that
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:10.96 three, four weeks, they're up here, 100%. The growth is tremendous and guess what, the
02:15:10.96 --> 02:15:15.44 heart of the trainer, the heart of the training, the more the guys appreciate it, the more growth
02:15:15.44 --> 02:15:20.80 you have. That's what I physically saw happening with with our formation.
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:26.56 Yeah, because it was miserable. Yes, it was freaking miserable. It was freaking hard. When you're
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:34.88 carrying out, I mean, if a platoon did a bad job, they'd have 12 down men. They'd be carrying out
02:15:34.88 --> 02:15:40.72 12 down men for three or four kilometers before they could finally get a helicopter in there
02:15:40.72 --> 02:15:44.32 to pick up and take the wounded, then they still got to walk, the rest of them got to walk out.
02:15:44.32 --> 02:15:48.64 Like when you got your ass kicked, you got your ass kicked and it would sometimes,
02:15:50.08 --> 02:15:55.04 you know, that was another big difference when a leader, when the leadership in the task unit
02:15:55.04 --> 02:15:59.36 or in the platoon would say, would come back and say, hey, we screwed up. We better fix it.
02:16:00.08 --> 02:16:05.92 They would fix it. If the kick, if they came back and said, oh, trade at cheating or trade at,
02:16:05.92 --> 02:16:10.16 this is this this training is unrealistic. If they said that, they wouldn't improve. And they just
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:16.24 follow a part. But when they say, hey, we spent too much time on target. Hey, we didn't cover
02:16:16.24 --> 02:16:22.32 move or hey, we didn't give the priorities correctly or we didn't have. When they came back and said
02:16:22.32 --> 02:16:29.68 that, recognize that they'd come out in a good task unit by the end, our trade at guys couldn't
02:16:29.68 --> 02:16:33.44 keep under wraps. Like, they would get the the trade at guys we get their ass's kicked.
02:16:33.44 --> 02:16:37.36 Because there's, because there's 40 of the back, I mean, 40 of the of the platoon guys.
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:42.56 So they could freaking, when they would do good cover move, you can't stop them.
02:16:42.56 --> 02:16:46.64 No. They're unstoppable. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what I always tell people, hey, man,
02:16:46.64 --> 02:16:51.68 the people who utilize the laws of combat did good cover and move kept things simple, good
02:16:51.68 --> 02:16:55.92 communications across board, prioritizing executed, stayed detached from what was going on
02:16:56.64 --> 02:17:00.24 in the guys that utilize decentralized command, whether they'll allow fire team leaders and
02:17:00.24 --> 02:17:04.64 squad leaders to make decisions at their level. Because you can't be everywhere as the boss
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:10.40 making these decisions. You got to train your, you got to train your, your leaders up, put up some
02:17:10.40 --> 02:17:14.72 guard wells, get them to where they need to be. And then you let them start making decisions, you know.
02:17:14.72 --> 02:17:17.92 And that's probably like one of the most beautiful things with land warfare.
02:17:17.92 --> 02:17:22.16 Guys are going out there, they're learning these things and they're slowly building their
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:26.000 confidence to where when they get to the field training exercise, we can start making some of
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.84 these decisions, then it's even that much more of a confidence builder, you know.
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:38.64 It's weird because you can, you can, I mean, look, I would explain this stuff.
02:17:39.20 --> 02:17:43.36 Ad knows you, right? Ad knows you. I mean, I would explain it and explain, I'd say, look,
02:17:43.36 --> 02:17:46.72 you got to do that. You got to do this. You got to do this. But sometimes, man,
02:17:46.72 --> 02:17:54.24 it would just take like it happening to someone. And being, and me sitting there like
02:17:54.24 --> 02:18:00.40 literally running over to a fire team leader and saying, hey, what are you doing? Those guys are
02:18:00.40 --> 02:18:03.60 freaking running right now. You got to get them down. You got to put down cover five of them
02:18:03.60 --> 02:18:08.40 and then I'm going, oh, wait a second, I get it. And then you'd see this light come on,
02:18:08.40 --> 02:18:12.88 or I'd run up to a freaking task. You'd a commander and be like, where do you want everyone to
02:18:12.88 --> 02:18:17.76 go right now? What do you want everyone to do? And he'd say, we need to get out of here. Okay,
02:18:17.76 --> 02:18:23.36 what direction? I said, are you going to be able to move everyone out of here? No. Can you think
02:18:23.36 --> 02:18:28.16 your fire teams can start moving? Yes, tell them where you want them to move. Just tell them all,
02:18:28.16 --> 02:18:32.64 and they'll start making it happen. And you could see the little, like all of a sudden, the
02:18:32.64 --> 02:18:39.04 light would come on. But sometimes it would just take that, like you have to live, you almost have
02:18:39.04 --> 02:18:44.16 to live through it. In some cases, some guys would be like, yeah, got it. Cover move, check, got it.
02:18:44.16 --> 02:18:49.20 Because you learn cover move day one or the day one of the teams, you learn cover move. You better
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:54.64 freaking cover move. Yeah, sometimes it took a guy's a little while to figure out how to utilize
02:18:54.64 --> 02:18:59.76 the train correctly. You know, because the train was a, was a factor of Rockies, small waddies,
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:04.24 uneven terrain, which was hard to maneuver, especially when you got a downman.
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:14.56 There was something there too. To train, to rain is the, is the next level. Right? The next
02:19:14.56 --> 02:19:20.96 level is, oh, I don't just know how to cover move. I just don't know simple. I just don't know
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:26.72 prioritize next. Cute. I don't just know decentralized command. I know how to utilize the terrain
02:19:26.72 --> 02:19:32.80 to my advantage. That's the next level up. That's the next level up. When you realize, oh,
02:19:32.80 --> 02:19:35.92 I can get a little high ground. Oh, there's a little dead space. Oh, there's a ravine over here.
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:40.40 I can get the guys out. That's the next level. And we tried to teach it in that method. You know,
02:19:40.40 --> 02:19:45.36 you start off doing I ads in a flat spot. And then all of a sudden you start to get used to rain.
02:19:45.36 --> 02:19:52.16 But when the leadership, when the, when the, when the whole task unit, when a fire team leader
02:19:52.16 --> 02:19:56.48 knows how to use terrain. And then all the fire team leaders know how to use terrain. All of a sudden
02:19:56.48 --> 02:20:03.92 we're in a whole different spot. Yeah. We're in a whole different spot. So yes, the terrain is so freaking
02:20:03.92 --> 02:20:10.000 critical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. A little bit of high ground. Yeah. We had guys down on that
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:17.52 micro tray. Doing good things. Yeah. Tough stuff on the body. And we had, I mean, we had rain,
02:20:17.52 --> 02:20:21.76 we had Rangers out there helping us. Oh, which was awesome. Do those guys, they brought a lot.
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:27.04 And the, the Rangers, we had out there. They had all kinds of both of them came from leadership
02:20:27.04 --> 02:20:32.24 assignments within their, their Ranger unit. And they had a lot of reps, man. They brought a lot to
02:20:32.24 --> 02:20:35.52 the table. They had all kinds of good info. We were eating it. We were just like,
02:20:35.52 --> 02:20:41.12 Com, stand by keep it coming. Keep it coming. Yeah. It's always, it's one of the, the worse,
02:20:41.12 --> 02:20:44.64 one of the bad things. One of the worse things about the, the seal teams is,
02:20:44.64 --> 02:20:52.80 we don't come from an infantry background. Yeah. You know, we're not soldiers. We're not infantry.
02:20:52.80 --> 02:20:58.16 We're, we're, so we don't have that skill set. And you can get lucky and you can get a brush
02:20:58.16 --> 02:21:03.20 up against it. I got, I got at least brushed up against it. Doing orgs with the Marines and being like,
02:21:03.20 --> 02:21:09.92 okay, I at least understand what an infantry platoon is. Yeah. Because if you regular seal,
02:21:09.92 --> 02:21:13.44 new guy, you don't know what the hell an infantry platoon is. You have no idea. You think a
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:18.96 platoon is 16 guys, you know, they're a platoon. But, but yeah, so those, so in the army,
02:21:19.52 --> 02:21:22.88 you have that infantry background. In the Marine Corps, you have that infantry background. It's
02:21:22.88 --> 02:21:27.52 so helpful. So having like, Rangers out there with us who were freaking great guys, by the way,
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:34.24 and they bring that that infantry background. And they were stoked too. They were, they freaking
02:21:34.24 --> 02:21:38.40 luck. They loved our trading. Yeah. They were awesome. The both of those guys had a lot of reps
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:43.12 in half canis 10. I'm trying to remember right. And I know where the, the one guy came in and he was
02:21:43.12 --> 02:21:50.80 really tightening up our helicopter procedures. Just, you know, you covered so much like damn
02:21:50.80 --> 02:21:54.72 I didn't even think about that. You know, all my deployments were to Iraq at that point.
02:21:55.60 --> 02:22:01.36 But yeah, good dudes, man. Did you read about face back then? Oh, yes. So I read it when I got to
02:22:01.36 --> 02:22:07.68 trade it. You know, you had that as your Bible. Damn, what was the guy's name? I had them in here.
02:22:07.68 --> 02:22:18.72 There was another kernel that he's got a page on four page for something in about face. But the guy
02:22:18.72 --> 02:22:23.76 was just a beast. Oh, Glover Jones. That's him. Yeah. And that guy had so many good nuggets on the
02:22:23.76 --> 02:22:29.28 page and a half. Yeah. Yeah. But I remember reading through that page 402 half worth. And he just has
02:22:29.28 --> 02:22:33.76 some nuggets. And there's got like 15 things that he covers. You know, strive to do small things. Well,
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:40.72 be a doer in a self-starter. You know, the one that I always hit home with me because I think it's so true
02:22:40.72 --> 02:22:46.24 is what is it? The two, you know, in order to be a good, two good characteristics of the leaders.
02:22:46.24 --> 02:22:52.32 You've got to be a good communicator and you've got to be a good writer. And the writing piece
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:56.40 comes into play as you start moving up in your upper level, leadership and management positions
02:22:56.40 --> 02:23:00.96 because you're writing e-vowels for the guys. And I remember being at trade it and you were kind of like,
02:23:00.96 --> 02:23:07.36 hey, man, if you guys bring me an e-vow in the thing requires minor or requires major surgery,
02:23:07.36 --> 02:23:12.56 I'm only going to be able to do so much to it to make it better. But you bring me an e-vow that's
02:23:12.56 --> 02:23:16.56 dialed in pretty damn tight. I'm going to get it over the line. It's going to be a beautiful piece of
02:23:16.56 --> 02:23:21.44 work. It's going to be a piece of art. And you're getting into people shit on it. You, you were not a
02:23:21.44 --> 02:23:26.24 happy camper because there was like always e-vowels coming in. Yeah. But it's so true when you think about it.
02:23:26.24 --> 02:23:31.36 Hey, how do we take care of people? A-way is in through our evaluation system. Making sure the
02:23:31.36 --> 02:23:36.40 right people are getting promoted and through awards, those all require some type of writing skill.
02:23:36.40 --> 02:23:41.84 Right. One, freaking series, one year of evaluations, probably the first year that you were there.
02:23:43.04 --> 02:23:48.96 The shit that you guys turned in. And I had no choice. I didn't get them till two late. And I just
02:23:48.96 --> 02:23:54.32 had to, I just had to do nine days in my office just rewriting every single one of them. And that's why
02:23:54.32 --> 02:24:03.12 the next year early. I said, hey, everyone, write me the e-vow for your best guy. And then I brought you guys
02:24:03.12 --> 02:24:08.24 it. You were in this group right? I brought you guys into the, into the conference room and posted
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:15.44 them up all the screen. I made you guys read your sentences to me. And you guys were just like,
02:24:16.32 --> 02:24:21.60 like the very first sentence that each guy read. It would just be like this blah, blah,
02:24:21.60 --> 02:24:27.76 just a shit sentence. And I'd be like, all right, how does that sound? Like not good. But that
02:24:27.76 --> 02:24:33.36 worked so well. Because then everyone realized, oh, I should actually read this stuff. I should
02:24:33.36 --> 02:24:37.44 actually read it aloud to myself. I should actually see if these sentences make sense. And it just
02:24:37.44 --> 02:24:43.44 helped everybody so, so it helped me. Because now you guys were all turning in square to way stuff
02:24:43.44 --> 02:24:49.68 which then I could, what, what would you say turn into a piece of art? I know, I go quite go that far.
02:24:49.68 --> 02:24:56.64 I believe in quotations of piece of art. Joccaloo. We got an artist on the net over here.
02:24:57.76 --> 02:25:02.24 Glover Johns from Hackworth to and he wrote a book called The Clay Pigeons of St. Love,
02:25:02.24 --> 02:25:06.40 which we covered on this podcast. And it's written. It's hard to tell because he wrote it in the third
02:25:06.40 --> 02:25:12.64 person talking about himself as if he was a different person, but it's about him. Then it's a great
02:25:12.64 --> 02:25:17.36 book and it gives all kinds of leadership lessons as well. One of the things I want to
02:25:17.36 --> 02:25:21.36 camp out of real quick on, on Hackworth. One of the things is I was reading through that book and it
02:25:21.36 --> 02:25:27.12 took me six months to get through it. It's a big book. But it really reinforced. You know, when you're
02:25:27.12 --> 02:25:31.52 coming in is a leader, at any level, and you're new to that leadership assignment, you're always
02:25:31.52 --> 02:25:36.56 uncomfortable. So you're trying to figure out am I making the right decision? And when you're going
02:25:36.56 --> 02:25:40.88 through and you're reading some nonfiction that pertains to your field, your field craft,
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.16 it just reinforces what you're thinking. And I remember after reading about face the maneuver
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:50.64 worth for a handbook, I came out of those like damn, a lot of these decisions I was uncertain about,
02:25:50.64 --> 02:25:55.44 it reinforced that I was making the right decision. So how do you become better? You read that
02:25:55.44 --> 02:26:00.24 stuff before you get those leadership positions. And who's responsible for, for destroying that
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:04.40 out, the leadership? You know, if you're in a leadership position out there, what are you doing to
02:26:04.40 --> 02:26:10.40 develop your future leaders? You have people that want to take your job. What are you doing to
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:15.20 develop them? And you go, look across the world like we got COVID everywhere. You can get a car accident.
02:26:15.20 --> 02:26:19.28 Who's the next person in line that's going to take your job? Who is that person? And what are you
02:26:19.28 --> 02:26:23.04 doing to develop them? You know, we've gotten way better over the years in the military and in
02:26:23.04 --> 02:26:27.28 a stubby doing this. Well, but let's think about that. That's pretty powerful. You know,
02:26:27.28 --> 02:26:34.000 yeah, do J.P. sent because I gave, I gave a J.P. a copy of, at least I think I gave it to him.
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.08 Anyways, he got a copy of the new addition of about face with the forwarding and everything. And so
02:26:38.08 --> 02:26:47.28 he's like sending me highlighted passages and he's not happy. And he's like, bro, I cannot believe
02:26:47.28 --> 02:26:54.88 that you didn't make me read this when I was a, you know, when I was 23 or 22. And I'm like,
02:26:54.88 --> 02:26:58.80 dude, I'm sorry, like I'm a horrible leader because there's so much information in there.
02:26:58.80 --> 02:27:06.88 And I just ripped it off wholesale, wholesale just ripped it off. And it's like, why didn't I
02:27:06.88 --> 02:27:12.96 share that? And part of me was I just didn't think team guys had any desire to read anything,
02:27:12.96 --> 02:27:19.52 you know, because most team guys didn't. Most team guys let me be here. You know what I did with my
02:27:19.52 --> 02:27:25.20 about face when I got back over to when I got over to team seven, I gave it out to one of our younger
02:27:25.20 --> 02:27:29.68 tactical. So that's like, like, that's a big book. I'm like, yes, you need to read that.
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:33.76 Did you? And then when you're done with it, you need to pass it on to someone else. Do you think you
02:27:33.76 --> 02:27:39.20 read it? I don't know man. See, you take book. It's such a big book. I don't know. It's good. And here's the thing,
02:27:39.20 --> 02:27:45.28 always talk about making hard calls. You look at those decisions he made in there. Those were,
02:27:45.84 --> 02:27:50.48 he was going to be hated. He knew that going in. He didn't care. He knew what the right thing to do
02:27:50.48 --> 02:27:55.44 was. He made the right calls. And you know, he wind up saving a lot of lives with his guys from
02:27:55.44 --> 02:28:01.92 it. Yeah, we'll see. There's a little nuance there in what you said. He had to make hard calls.
02:28:01.92 --> 02:28:09.20 He knew that he would be hated in the short term. He knew that there would be resistance. Yeah.
02:28:09.20 --> 02:28:14.96 But he knew in the end he would be admired and he would be loved because he would be able to keep his
02:28:14.96 --> 02:28:20.80 guys alive. And he knew that that what what would shine through is the fact that he cared about his
02:28:20.80 --> 02:28:26.48 men. Yeah. That's what would shine through. And believe me, when we had General Mooka Yamon,
02:28:26.48 --> 02:28:33.44 I was so, uh, not really worried, but like going into it. Here I'm going to meet a guy that
02:28:33.44 --> 02:28:39.12 worked for Freak and Hack. And what is he going to say? Yeah. Like he's going to be like, well,
02:28:39.12 --> 02:28:43.12 you know, Hack will made himself out to be a little bit more than he was or Hack talked to good
02:28:43.12 --> 02:28:46.96 game, but that really wasn't the guy he was air. I didn't know what he was going to say. Yeah.
02:28:46.96 --> 02:28:54.08 But dude, he was just 100% 100% Hack was the man. And he was a company commander when
02:28:54.08 --> 02:28:58.40 Hack was a baton commander. I mean, that's the that's the leadership. Wow. So, you know,
02:28:59.68 --> 02:29:03.68 what what you know and I said, did you know who Hack was? He was everybody knew who Hack was.
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:12.000 And like that attitude and and I said, you know, what how did you, what was it that made
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.20 he goes everything like the way he's carried himself, the way he looked, the way he had his head,
02:29:17.20 --> 02:29:21.76 he had his hair, he's like he had his head shaved and he just looked like this guy's just freaking
02:29:21.76 --> 02:29:27.04 square away from day one. But so you're going to make because because one thing I don't like
02:29:27.04 --> 02:29:33.60 and Lafayne, I have talked about this on the podcast is the someone thinking, well, you know,
02:29:33.60 --> 02:29:37.92 I'm in charge, so I'm going to be hated and that's okay. It's like, no, that's actually not okay.
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:42.24 If you're hated by your troops, that's a freaking problem. That means you're doing something wrong.
02:29:43.12 --> 02:29:49.28 For your troops to take over a unit or take over a team or take over a position
02:29:49.28 --> 02:29:52.40 and say, all right, we're going to start making some adjustments.
02:29:53.44 --> 02:29:58.000 Now, one thing that's different to in Hack's case when he took over the 439, this he took over a
02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.96 disaster, a known disaster. He had to come in there and kind of swing a hammer a little bit.
02:30:02.96 --> 02:30:07.92 Oh, he had to bring out the flame throw. Yeah, he had to do some barbecue. He had to do some barbecue.
02:30:08.48 --> 02:30:13.68 But he also eventually, you know, anyone would do anything. You know, like talking to General
02:30:13.68 --> 02:30:17.44 Mucchial, those guys would do absolutely anything for happen. Anything. And even the freaking,
02:30:17.44 --> 02:30:20.56 even the drafties would do anything for Hackworth. Like they loved them. Yeah.
02:30:21.28 --> 02:30:24.88 And it's kind of like you said earlier, when people go through hard training, they appreciate it
02:30:24.88 --> 02:30:30.08 and they love the training more. When you are disciplined with your troops, when you're hard on
02:30:30.08 --> 02:30:36.80 your troops, they respect you and they respect themselves. And you start to get this camaraderie that you need.
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.72 You know, I think a hack worth, I think of like you said a dude showing up right here, cut,
02:30:42.72 --> 02:30:50.48 right uniform, just everything he's communicating lines up with his actions. And the guys just
02:30:50.48 --> 02:30:54.16 had to be like, damn, does this guy do anything wrong? You know what I mean? Is he sweet?
02:30:54.16 --> 02:30:58.16 Let's go on on with this dude. And then when you look at that, you're like, hey, my margin of air
02:30:58.16 --> 02:31:03.44 is going to be small because this dude's doing everything he's saying. Yeah, you know, that's
02:31:03.44 --> 02:31:08.16 powerful. That leadership, by example, that's how you got to roll 100%.
02:31:08.16 --> 02:31:13.68 What, anything else from trade at? No, I was all good. Christmas in the desert.
02:31:14.24 --> 02:31:20.08 Christmas in the desert. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I remember, uh, nine-lin man, we were wrapping up.
02:31:20.08 --> 02:31:25.44 And we had to, it was a good run. The troop came through good energy levels and we're getting ready to
02:31:25.44 --> 02:31:31.68 go home. And you came and you said, that wasn't bad guys. And I was like, all right, let me put that
02:31:31.68 --> 02:31:36.88 through my enlisted description device up here. What Jockel saying is, good job. Have a good
02:31:36.88 --> 02:31:41.84 Christmas. He loves you all and you're like, oh, go, go, go. You gave a little chuckle out of there.
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:45.84 So I got you kind of being hugged here there right before Christmas. The spirits were good.
02:31:47.84 --> 02:31:51.52 So I said that wasn't bad. That's a, that's a good of a compliment as you're going to get out of
02:31:51.52 --> 02:31:55.52 me. Yeah. I had to translate it for him. But yeah, let's check.
02:31:57.60 --> 02:32:05.28 Maybe compliments weren't my strong point. They were not. I got some recordings of some of those
02:32:05.28 --> 02:32:12.08 debriefs. Somebody's, somebody's hooking me up. One of one of my buddies. He just texted me a couple
02:32:12.08 --> 02:32:17.84 weeks ago and he said, hey, somebody gave me recordings of your debriefs. He said, you're going to want
02:32:17.84 --> 02:32:24.40 to hear him like, Chad. I remember being on Target out there. And this unit was maneuvering.
02:32:24.96 --> 02:32:31.52 I forget what's happening. But one of the guys communication is so long. Hey, I need you to grab
02:32:31.52 --> 02:32:35.68 your guys and move to the mountain like in Black Hawk down to like, what the hell? What don't you,
02:32:35.68 --> 02:32:41.04 you know, what are you talking about there? It was just crazy talking. Yeah, just hit record on my voice
02:32:41.04 --> 02:32:45.52 recorded during those things and play it back for people like listen to yourself. I think
02:32:45.52 --> 02:32:49.12 you need to keep your stuff a little clearer. More simple clear and concise. I was keeping it
02:32:49.12 --> 02:32:55.12 simple. Oh, really listen to this. Here's you telling your troops. Peel right. I need everyone to
02:32:55.12 --> 02:33:00.80 blow, blow, blow, blow, blow. Freaking ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, freaking totally ridiculous. Yeah, yeah,
02:33:00.80 --> 02:33:08.24 what was crazy. So then where'd you go? Yep. So after that, head back over to our headed two teams
02:33:08.24 --> 02:33:12.000 seven and at that point it already made master chief. So I was going to there's the ops,
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:18.16 master chief, senior listed guy and then I got pegged to do. So I went back there and what October
02:33:18.16 --> 02:33:24.96 22,000 nine October, 20,000 nine just finished up the senior listed cadmium. They're like, hey,
02:33:24.96 --> 02:33:29.28 those big one. They're trying to pump as many people as they can over an Afghanistan. So I got hit
02:33:29.28 --> 02:33:34.72 with a joint individual augment headed out to a small outstation out in Afghanistan. I was the senior
02:33:34.72 --> 02:33:39.68 listed leader out there, which was a good experience. So the first time at that point where I
02:33:39.68 --> 02:33:46.08 really worked in a joint environment. So my boss was a full bird colonel. He was SF dude. Good guy
02:33:46.08 --> 02:33:50.16 learned a lot from him. He'd been in like 32 years. He was prior and listed and worked as we have
02:33:50.16 --> 02:33:56.72 to the right. He's just a salty old dog. And then we had the army air force, Marine Corps out there
02:33:56.72 --> 02:34:02.56 everyone. And then we had quite a few military officers from different countries. We had Afghanistan
02:34:02.56 --> 02:34:10.24 and a few other surrounding countries in there. And our primary goal was to fusion until. And then
02:34:10.24 --> 02:34:15.84 we had some reconnaissance platforms up overhead and they were doing their stuff. And
02:34:15.84 --> 02:34:22.08 some other countries. But it was good. And that was the first time I really appreciated our special
02:34:22.08 --> 02:34:27.12 forces unit. And I was working with another senior listed leader. He was in another country.
02:34:27.12 --> 02:34:30.88 And he's like, hey man, here's what we got going on. I mean, and we'd communicate back and forth,
02:34:30.88 --> 02:34:36.88 you know, like once or twice a week. And he's like, hey, I got my SF Italian. We're training up this.
02:34:36.88 --> 02:34:41.04 And he's like, here's our numbers. And I was like, hey, wait a minute. You guys have this many,
02:34:41.04 --> 02:34:48.08 you know, ODA's over there. And you've trained up. You've man trained in a quip. 2000 of these soldiers.
02:34:48.08 --> 02:34:53.52 He's like, yeah. And I was like, holy shit dude, that's a big deal, man. That's like our formation
02:34:53.52 --> 02:34:59.52 in a SW and action over there. You know, yeah. Like by that, you mean all of the West Coast seal
02:34:59.52 --> 02:35:04.16 and all support. Yeah. In action. Yeah. And so these guys were trained up these guys and they're
02:35:04.16 --> 02:35:08.72 going in and they're fighting the Taliban. And he's got his ODA's doing it. I was like, holy shit,
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:14.16 that's pretty badass, man. So it was a good deployment, like not much going on outside the
02:35:14.16 --> 02:35:18.24 wire. The area I was in was actually like, yeah, I was like, cool. I just got out of Nailin. Then I go over
02:35:18.24 --> 02:35:22.96 there. And I'm like, they're going back in Nailin. The terrain is exactly what they say. I would
02:35:22.96 --> 02:35:27.28 know, there was some hub hub about us losing our desert training facility. Someone else was going
02:35:27.28 --> 02:35:33.60 to take it over. Oh, yeah. And I made this this slide show. Did I ever show you that? I made a slide
02:35:33.60 --> 02:35:40.48 show. And it was pictures of Afghanistan and pictures of our desert training facility side by side.
02:35:40.48 --> 02:35:45.20 And you literally couldn't tell the difference. Wow. And I was like, you've got to be kidding me.
02:35:45.20 --> 02:35:52.32 If you think that this isn't the greatest training site for us to have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So
02:35:52.32 --> 02:35:56.64 anyways, that was a short deployment at that point. I'm the ops master chief that I'm deployed.
02:35:57.20 --> 02:36:02.88 Come back six months later. I got home right before July. And then as I'm back at the team,
02:36:02.88 --> 02:36:06.80 the team's going through unit level training. And then we're prepping up for our deployment
02:36:06.80 --> 02:36:12.80 in March timeframe. And that was a weird deployment. Like we wanted up some of us wound up back
02:36:12.80 --> 02:36:19.68 over in Iraq. And so this is 2010, 2011 timeframe now. And we're breaking down Iraq. Yes.
02:36:19.68 --> 02:36:24.80 And we're also yeah, we're waiting for our four battoons. They're still in San Diego to get over to
02:36:24.80 --> 02:36:31.52 Afghanistan. And they're going over to do village stability operations. So get over to Iraq. And
02:36:31.52 --> 02:36:36.24 that, you know, that deployment, it was a long one. It was like eight and a half months long.
02:36:37.36 --> 02:36:41.68 A lot of, you know, the unit we were working with had all the bells and whistles. And it was
02:36:41.68 --> 02:36:46.08 good man. So a lot of good things happened. And our guys wrapped up quite a few bad guys.
02:36:46.64 --> 02:36:50.48 And it was, it was a good learning experience. It was, it was a first time I was in,
02:36:51.28 --> 02:36:57.28 you know, a professional jock setting where you're actually seeing everything unfold in real time.
02:36:57.28 --> 02:37:02.40 All they ask that you can imagine, you know, and our guys did some good targeting. They got a
02:37:02.40 --> 02:37:07.12 couple of bad guys have been after for four or five years. So it was good. Then came back off that
02:37:07.12 --> 02:37:11.44 deployment. Then took over as the team, you know, command master chief. So explain what a team
02:37:11.44 --> 02:37:19.12 command master chief is. Well, our primary job is to initially use the setup the battoons. You're
02:37:19.12 --> 02:37:23.12 working with the, you know, the top five of the team, the commanding officer of the XO,
02:37:23.12 --> 02:37:27.68 your operations department, you know, the senior listed in there and the, and the ops boss.
02:37:30.48 --> 02:37:34.24 In, in your primary functions are manning training and equipping the civil team. And you're the
02:37:34.24 --> 02:37:40.80 senior and listed leader and tactical advisor to the commanding officer. Your primary goal is training
02:37:40.80 --> 02:37:47.04 up all these, you're not training, educating and training, you know, your, your patoon chiefs and
02:37:47.04 --> 02:37:54.80 task unit senior listed advisors. Can't junior officers. And so you take over this position and
02:37:54.80 --> 02:38:02.40 you start building platoons. Yeah. Yeah. And I always used to say about platoons. Let's say there's a
02:38:02.40 --> 02:38:11.04 magic number. Let's say the number number is 20. Yeah. In your top four in a platoon. So your LPO,
02:38:11.04 --> 02:38:15.52 your assistant platoon commander, your platoon commander, your platoon chief. That number's got a equal
02:38:15.52 --> 02:38:23.44 20. When you add them all together. Yeah. So that means if you have a platoon chief, that's like a
02:38:23.44 --> 02:38:29.76 16 because he's just a badass. Cool. You can give them a platoon commander. That's like a two and of LPO
02:38:29.76 --> 02:38:37.60 that's a one. If you have a platoon chief, that's like a, you know, maybe a six, you got to give them a
02:38:37.60 --> 02:38:42.64 platoon commander. That's maybe like a seven and you got to even it out. What you don't want to do
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:47.04 is make sure first of all, you got to make sure that the number gets to 20. Yeah. Because if it doesn't
02:38:47.04 --> 02:38:51.92 get to 20, you're going to have issues. Then then you got to compliment strengths and weaknesses.
02:38:51.92 --> 02:38:54.96 You know, if you've got a guy that's got a bunch of tactical experience, put his horrible
02:38:54.96 --> 02:39:00.96 paperwork. Well, cool. You know, put him with a person that's good at good at paperwork. So there's
02:39:00.96 --> 02:39:07.92 a lot of balancing in there that you need to do. Absolutely. And I know, uh, our 20, when we formed
02:39:07.92 --> 02:39:12.48 of the team in 2010, we went with some heavy platoon. What the idea we're going to go back and
02:39:12.48 --> 02:39:18.96 have gannistered. And in one of the things with our training and deployment schedules, that there's
02:39:18.96 --> 02:39:24.08 a lot of lag time in there. So things are always changing. And I was like, man, when we get back
02:39:24.08 --> 02:39:28.64 and I'm forming up the team, I want to make sure just to your point, all these platoons are balanced
02:39:28.64 --> 02:39:33.04 out. You know, when you go heavy and some platoons, that means you're going to be light in the others.
02:39:33.04 --> 02:39:39.44 Yeah. And that comes, that comes at a cost. And in the really, what I wanted was you got how many
02:39:39.44 --> 02:39:44.000 platoon do you have a seal team? You should be able to pick up any one of those platoons and snap them in,
02:39:44.56 --> 02:39:49.28 no matter where, you know, where you're going, what the mission is. They should all be
02:39:49.28 --> 02:39:54.48 pretty balanced out equally with experience in the platoon, leadership. Yeah, you're, yeah, check.
02:39:54.48 --> 02:40:00.000 And here's another thing to be careful of. Be to watch out for. You, you're trying to get to 20.
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:10.000 You don't build the platoon with a leadership level 40. Yeah. Because it's probably not going to work
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.08 the way you think it is. What you're going to end up with is a bunch of big personalities. Like,
02:40:14.08 --> 02:40:20.56 you take the strongest possible OIC, the strongest possible chief, the strongest possible LPO,
02:40:20.56 --> 02:40:24.56 and the strongest, what you're going to end up with is people that they all want to freaking
02:40:24.56 --> 02:40:27.04 stab each other in the back. They all want to be the guy. They all want to, they have such
02:40:27.04 --> 02:40:32.32 begos and it just turns into a nightmare. So building the stacked platoon leadership is generally
02:40:32.32 --> 02:40:36.88 not a good call. And you're going to even even if it happened, if you actually had such
02:40:36.88 --> 02:40:44.24 exceptional individuals that they actually did work well together, well, then it's bad that you
02:40:44.24 --> 02:40:47.92 have them all together. Because like you said, you're not balanced now, they'll rush to the teams.
02:40:47.92 --> 02:40:55.52 Because because you should take those exceptionally, because for a, for a level 20 individual leader,
02:40:55.52 --> 02:41:04.40 actually, for, for a level 17 individual leader to work with another high performing leader,
02:41:04.40 --> 02:41:10.48 that other leader needs to be a 20. Yeah. Because that, the person that's a 20 and 20 instead of a
02:41:10.48 --> 02:41:18.64 17, the difference between a 17 and a 20 is that 17 can can subordinate their ego. That's the
02:41:18.64 --> 02:41:23.28 difference. Because when you take two people that are 18s, they're missing quality that they don't have
02:41:23.28 --> 02:41:27.20 is that they don't, they don't know how to work with other people and subordinate their ego.
02:41:27.20 --> 02:41:34.80 That's what gets you to a freaking level 20 yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The balanced out patoons are
02:41:34.80 --> 02:41:40.32 our key for the entire team. It's goodness. And you think about it. So if I'm bringing in a patoon,
02:41:41.12 --> 02:41:45.92 we really spread out our guys with two and three patoons. Because those guys are developing
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:49.84 the next set of leaders below them. The patoon chief and LPO and everyone's got to develop the
02:41:49.84 --> 02:41:53.60 other guys too. But those guys have the most impact. When the leadership's gone, they're the
02:41:53.60 --> 02:41:59.28 guys that are around and their shown on what right looks like. So we crossed it quite a few guys,
02:41:59.28 --> 02:42:05.84 got everything balanced out good. And overall, our deployment was un-eventful for that one,
02:42:05.84 --> 02:42:13.20 went over to Sincam and we were on standby to standby. That was after Ben Gazi and happy. So the
02:42:13.20 --> 02:42:17.28 new normal was, hey, beyond standby, in case there's a crisis in there. If crisis comes up,
02:42:17.28 --> 02:42:25.44 we want to have special operations posture to go handle an embassy type event. And it was good.
02:42:25.44 --> 02:42:29.60 So for that deployment, we wanted to, you know, in and out of the embassy quite a bit, which was good.
02:42:29.60 --> 02:42:33.60 Because I was like, oh, I've never been in embassy before. So you're talking directly to
02:42:33.60 --> 02:42:38.16 the ambassador and whole new world. Yeah. And you got to be professional. You got to have your suit on.
02:42:38.16 --> 02:42:43.92 And you know, you can't drop any of bombs out there. Yeah. It's a whole new world. Yeah. So it was a
02:42:43.92 --> 02:42:48.80 really good learning experience, although nothing happened. I don't say this. We got poshured.
02:42:49.52 --> 02:42:55.20 You know, we had a unit over into a neighboring country. And that country was, you know,
02:42:55.60 --> 02:43:00.48 they were going through a withdrawal process. And our unit still stayed in position, but we were
02:43:00.48 --> 02:43:05.20 going to reinforce that unit. So we were staged. We had to stage. So we brought in the aircraft,
02:43:05.20 --> 02:43:09.52 which, you know, we're going through a full blown rehearsal. Like we're, we think and we're going to launch
02:43:09.52 --> 02:43:16.08 our guys. And you know, our, my biggest takeaway from that point was like, hey, these relationships,
02:43:16.08 --> 02:43:20.56 we have with the embassy, they matter. Because all we had to do was call up there because we had a
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:24.56 tight relationship. And they tell us, hey, here's what's going on. The ambassadors working with
02:43:24.56 --> 02:43:27.68 the prints and the prints. And they're going through this whole thing. Do we want to launch out
02:43:27.68 --> 02:43:33.36 here? Do we not want to launch out here? So it was good. You know, it was boring, but it was a good
02:43:33.36 --> 02:43:38.96 learning experience. Yeah. And for for people that don't really know too much about this world,
02:43:38.96 --> 02:43:45.04 there, there can be and usually is a lot of tension between the state department, which is the
02:43:45.04 --> 02:43:52.000 ambassadors and whatnot and the military. Yeah. Because the state department wants to solve things
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.68 diplomatically. Yeah. That's what their life is, right? And the military, we think we can solve
02:43:57.68 --> 02:44:03.28 things militarily. So there's tension. Yeah. There's often tension between those two sides.
02:44:03.28 --> 02:44:09.20 But if you remember that, hey, we all have the same goal, right? We all have the goal of
02:44:09.20 --> 02:44:14.48 stability and security and overall peace. So if we understand that and we're working towards the same
02:44:14.48 --> 02:44:19.04 goal, let's figure out the best way to go about it. And those tensions look hopefully we can
02:44:19.04 --> 02:44:23.12 overcome. Yeah. Because they can cause to, they can cause some really bad things to happen.
02:44:23.12 --> 02:44:28.96 You know, there can be times where the military should be used. And if the relationship was good,
02:44:28.96 --> 02:44:33.36 the military would be used. Yeah. And there's some times where the military shouldn't be used.
02:44:33.36 --> 02:44:37.12 Yeah. And if the relationship is bad, the military gets used even though it really shouldn't be used.
02:44:37.12 --> 02:44:41.60 Yeah. So once again, forming good relationships is,
02:44:42.80 --> 02:44:47.84 it's just freaking critical. No, absolutely. Especially in that environment, more so than ever.
02:44:47.84 --> 02:44:52.56 You know, hey, going back into when we were forming up, you know, one of the first things we did
02:44:52.56 --> 02:44:59.28 is, you know, what grabbed in our go-lock, you know, our, our enlisted formation, he's 79.
02:44:59.28 --> 02:45:04.88 And we went through roles and responsibilities. And the CMCI had at the time when I was my
02:45:04.88 --> 02:45:09.60 task unit, when I was a task unit, senior, the supervisor. He went through, and I don't know how
02:45:09.60 --> 02:45:14.16 much you played into the roles and responsibilities. He developed or if they crossed actual
02:45:14.16 --> 02:45:18.40 what, but he went through every position. So I'd already had something that I'd kept for
02:45:18.40 --> 02:45:24.96 G's. What is this? Four years now, four or five years later. And I've got it and I go through,
02:45:24.96 --> 02:45:30.000 and I'm, I'm tweaking the verbage in there to fit to, you know, to art to our era or time to our era.
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:35.36 Yeah. And so go through roles and responsibilities with the go-lock and our tactical level leaders.
02:45:35.36 --> 02:45:40.72 Hey, here's my expectations as a leader. And we had your jockel brief on there. So I had a little
02:45:40.72 --> 02:45:44.80 reading folder on our drive. Here's what's in there. Read this shit. It's going to make you better
02:45:44.80 --> 02:45:50.32 leader. And I think for the most part, our guys did. Like we didn't have too many missteps for that,
02:45:51.44 --> 02:45:57.44 for that workup cycle and deployment. You know, things were relatively contained. You know, like
02:45:57.44 --> 02:46:04.16 no cookie shit. No big event. Yeah, setting expectations is definitely solid. And in the in the
02:46:04.48 --> 02:46:09.84 seal version of the jockel brief, there's a side that was roles and responsibilities. By person. Yep.
02:46:09.84 --> 02:46:15.60 Like task unit commander, here's what you're doing. And I went right on down the line. And I'm sure
02:46:15.60 --> 02:46:20.32 you guys had to adjust it to. But the point is, and the reason I don't give it really in this
02:46:20.32 --> 02:46:23.84 civil, because I don't give it. I don't give roles and responsibilities part of the brief,
02:46:24.56 --> 02:46:28.56 because I don't know what the roles and responsibilities are in this construction company. You
02:46:28.56 --> 02:46:32.80 were in this manufacturing company or in this financial company, right? It changes the shifts.
02:46:32.80 --> 02:46:36.56 But in the seal, but in the seal, but in the seal, in the seal task unit, I knew what the rules
02:46:36.56 --> 02:46:41.28 responsibilities were. And listen, and here's something I used to explain. Like, if you're
02:46:42.40 --> 02:46:49.68 the platoon chief and you're supposed to be the person that's handling the tactical situation.
02:46:50.40 --> 02:46:55.60 Okay. If the officer is supposed to be looking at the next move that we're going to take.
02:46:56.24 --> 02:47:01.76 Hey, listen, chief, if your officer is not capable of doing that, you better get your LPO trained
02:47:01.76 --> 02:47:06.000 up so he can handle the tactical situation. So you can go and and figure out what you're going to
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:12.24 do next. So we have to be able to not just do like our specific job, our role in responsibility,
02:47:12.24 --> 02:47:17.20 but if we have to inside of our platoon, we might have to say, hey, you know what, chief, you handle this
02:47:17.20 --> 02:47:22.48 over here. You know, if I got a chief that's not super dynamic on target, and I got an LPO that's a
02:47:22.48 --> 02:47:28.88 badass. I'll go, hey, hey, LPO, you're going to be responsible for this stuff. You're going to be
02:47:28.88 --> 02:47:34.08 responsible for the assault. Chief, you're going to be responsible for the marshalling. Okay, cool.
02:47:34.08 --> 02:47:38.40 Got it. You're like, that's okay. It doesn't matter. Now, look, don't let your ego get in the way
02:47:38.40 --> 02:47:42.08 because the chief will almost be in charge of your assault. Cool. You're not good at it.
02:47:42.08 --> 02:47:46.64 Yeah. And of course, I'd be much more gentle about it. What I would say is, hey, you know,
02:47:46.64 --> 02:47:50.24 well, the thing is I want the LPO to get some experience. So we're going to let him handle some of
02:47:50.24 --> 02:47:55.20 these right now and see how he does. And in the meantime, you can just kind of handle the marshalling
02:47:55.20 --> 02:48:01.68 over here, you know, with the with the A, O, I see. But yeah, those roles responsibility. So the fact
02:48:01.68 --> 02:48:07.68 that you laid those out early, let's everyone know what the expectation is. Let's everybody know
02:48:07.68 --> 02:48:12.24 where you stand. Right. Let's everybody know like, hey, I don't put up, I'm not going to put up with
02:48:12.24 --> 02:48:16.40 this. I'm not going to put up with that. I'm not going to put up with the other thing. If you're
02:48:16.40 --> 02:48:21.12 out of line, come, you better come and tell me what's going on. If I get blindsided, you're going to be
02:48:21.12 --> 02:48:28.96 problems. So all those, all those things, absolutely. Like, that's a great point. Setting those expectations
02:48:28.96 --> 02:48:36.72 of what you, what you need, what you want, what your standards are. You set those out of the gate.
02:48:36.72 --> 02:48:41.76 It's going to line people real quick. Yeah. And then you model them. You got a model. Yeah, yeah,
02:48:41.76 --> 02:48:45.44 I do what you're saying. Oh, yeah, if you're, if you're not, you might as well just freaking
02:48:46.24 --> 02:48:50.32 just not even put out the word. If you're going to say, hey, everyone be square away. You're going to
02:48:50.32 --> 02:48:55.28 act like a jackass. Just don't even put it out. Yeah, just clean your own videos. This is good.
02:48:55.28 --> 02:49:01.52 Don't move. And then what? And then what? So finish up that deployment. Come back. And then I
02:49:01.52 --> 02:49:06.96 go and work it out. Headquarters for our forest master chief, which was an awesome guy at the
02:49:06.96 --> 02:49:11.92 time, or truckload from him, which I would have tried to be able to use from our next two positions.
02:49:11.92 --> 02:49:17.28 And so at the headquarters element, you know, what I have on here, let me just go back one
02:49:17.28 --> 02:49:21.76 real quick. The headquarters element was good because it was the first time I'm outside of that
02:49:21.76 --> 02:49:28.24 that that sealed team, you know, whether it's training or just seal, you know,
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.44 mission. You're up at the headquarters element. You know, I was in the same
02:49:33.44 --> 02:49:37.28 office here, but I'm working for the forest. You're working for the admiral. So it's
02:49:37.28 --> 02:49:41.92 very similar line. Did you do how long do you work there for? Right around less than a year and a
02:49:41.92 --> 02:49:47.20 half got it. But it was enough. We're ready to get out of there after 12 months. But here's what I would
02:49:47.20 --> 02:49:54.000 say. I wish I would have done that position early or on, probably like as a chief or a senior chief.
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.76 But what is right? Look like where does it fit? The training I think would have priority because
02:49:57.76 --> 02:50:03.12 that's going to set you up tactically. But going up there, you're like holy cow, your aperture
02:50:03.12 --> 02:50:10.72 just opens wide up with actually how things work. You know, with with seal battoons going over
02:50:10.72 --> 02:50:15.52 in two Afghanistan and do I rack? How all that stuff works? You want more gear? Here's the
02:50:15.52 --> 02:50:20.72 process to procure the gear and you're going through all that. One of the things the guy I
02:50:20.72 --> 02:50:26.08 worked for did is he was up there and he like he laid out initiatives. Hey, here's the initiatives.
02:50:26.08 --> 02:50:31.68 I want to get over the line and then I was the guy, you know, when he's on travel back at the
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:36.72 black palace trying to move these tanks forward as you know, as quickly as possible without
02:50:36.72 --> 02:50:40.80 missing anything. So it was a good experience and the guy I worked for he had over 30 years and
02:50:40.80 --> 02:50:45.36 he bounced around just he was a good dude man. Yeah, learn a lot from him. Yeah, well,
02:50:45.36 --> 02:50:49.84 you're right. I did work it. We worked in the exact same front of the college, the front office.
02:50:49.84 --> 02:50:59.36 Yeah. And for sure, when you start to see, you start to see how small of a roll, right? Like
02:51:00.88 --> 02:51:05.36 you're small. There's like there's like the whole military. That's the first time you get a taste of
02:51:05.92 --> 02:51:10.32 like did you go to the Pentagon? Did you go on travel with your boss? I went back to a
02:51:10.32 --> 02:51:15.68 socom. I didn't travel that much with those guys. Yeah, so I was going to the Pentagon. Yeah.
02:51:15.68 --> 02:51:24.56 I was I was you know sitting in in the back of the meeting with socom, you know, over and over again
02:51:24.56 --> 02:51:31.36 and here in the world being put out and seeing the handwritten notes from the secretary of defense,
02:51:31.36 --> 02:51:36.16 you know what I'm saying? Like all the sudden you realize how big this machine is
02:51:36.16 --> 02:51:43.20 and that puts things in perspective for you. And yes, you learn a lot about you know how to make things
02:51:43.20 --> 02:51:47.36 happen and how well not how to make things happen, but how things happen. And then you can at least
02:51:47.36 --> 02:51:51.04 provide some level of influence on trying to hopefully make things happen yourself. Yeah.
02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:56.08 Because that's a big understanding it makes all the difference in the world. Yeah, because now you know how to
02:51:56.08 --> 02:52:00.48 navigate it. Yeah, and you also know like I'm there's no point getting frustrated about this thing over here.
02:52:00.48 --> 02:52:05.60 Because I can at least explain to the troops. Hey, this is why this is happening. I know it seems
02:52:05.60 --> 02:52:11.36 crazy, but guess what? The money that's getting spent for weapons right now was actually allocated
02:52:11.36 --> 02:52:18.24 five years ago. Yeah. Yeah. And so if you're going to be mad about it, that's fine, but it's not going
02:52:18.24 --> 02:52:24.08 to help. Yeah. Yeah. That and that was the issue. I remember we were getting gear three, four years
02:52:24.08 --> 02:52:29.68 later that was designed for the previous three years. And it was already obsolete. Like I don't
02:52:29.68 --> 02:52:35.12 do, I can't even use this stuff right now. You know, but it was good. And I remember being up there in 2015.
02:52:35.12 --> 02:52:39.92 And I think that was when you and Dave sent your first published copy of extreme ownership
02:52:39.92 --> 02:52:43.68 up there for approval. Oh, yeah. Well, then it wasn't a published copy. It was probably like a
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:48.32 man you script. That's what it was. So I got me a copy of that. Oh, really got the early one.
02:52:48.32 --> 02:52:51.84 I got the early one. So I read through that in order to expect, you know, in the back then everyone's
02:52:51.84 --> 02:52:55.52 going, hey, man, people are on the net writing books. I'm like, let's see what Jocelyn
02:52:55.52 --> 02:52:59.44 lay for writing about here. A little courtesy copy. And I remember picking up my reading like
02:52:59.44 --> 02:53:03.68 damn, this is really good because the way you guys translated into the business role was just,
02:53:03.68 --> 02:53:10.88 you know, it made sense, you know. So in plus you recognized it all. Yeah. From from the Jockel
02:53:10.88 --> 02:53:16.56 brief, which is, you know, basically where your hall came from. Yeah. And your guys at the way you
02:53:16.56 --> 02:53:21.12 wrote it, the position on it was from a humility standpoint, which people are going to appreciate
02:53:21.12 --> 02:53:28.24 that. So it was good, man. Yeah, I know that was a that was a big obstacle to overcome mentally.
02:53:28.24 --> 02:53:36.24 You know, like, for me it was massive. You know, I can't speak for life, but like for me, I mean,
02:53:36.24 --> 02:53:41.36 we just talked, open this whole thing up about talking about reputation. Yeah. And all of a sudden,
02:53:41.36 --> 02:53:48.32 you know, you can, you can destroy your reputation by becoming that guy. Yeah. We wrote that book
02:53:48.32 --> 02:53:54.80 and, you know, and that's, so that was horrible. That was a horrible experience to go through.
02:53:54.80 --> 02:53:57.92 It was like walking into the unknown and you can't look and you can't,
02:54:00.16 --> 02:54:07.20 there's look when you write a book, it is not a humble act, right? Like there's no,
02:54:07.20 --> 02:54:11.68 there's, it's like saying, hey, I'm going to go freaking, uh, uh, uh, start a podcast.
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:16.16 Get a designer suit. Yeah, we're starting a podcast. Hey, I'm going to go get a designer suit.
02:54:16.16 --> 02:54:21.60 But it's not, it's not for me. Yeah. Like it doesn't work. Or hey, I'm going to start a podcast and talk
02:54:21.60 --> 02:54:26.56 a bunch. Like when you got to talk about you, so to say you're going to write a book, you're going to
02:54:26.56 --> 02:54:30.48 start a podcast or you're going to put a spotlight on yourself. It's basically what you're doing.
02:54:30.48 --> 02:54:35.04 That's, that's the way I'm saying. Right. When you write a book, you're putting a spotlight on yourself,
02:54:35.04 --> 02:54:39.68 look at me. Yeah. And, and there's no, it doesn't matter what that book says,
02:54:39.68 --> 02:54:47.28 yeah. At least at the initial impression. Like you, you, you, you are putting a spotlight on yourself.
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:52.96 And I hated that and it was really, it was hard to overcome that. Yeah. But then you think,
02:54:52.96 --> 02:54:56.72 here we are working with these civilian companies. Yeah. And they are
02:54:57.84 --> 02:55:04.000 being able to move forward and execute better. And it's like, you know what,
02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.92 the stuff that we learned is probably worth teaching. Yeah. Yeah. The stuff that we learned is
02:55:09.92 --> 02:55:18.32 people need to hear it. And then one of the, the, the Admiral, you know, to kind of had that kind
02:55:18.32 --> 02:55:26.000 of conversation with him. And he says, he said, he goes, you know what, Joko, we are quiet professionals.
02:55:26.40 --> 02:55:32.80 We are not silent professionals. And some of the stories need to be told and some of the lessons
02:55:32.80 --> 02:55:38.72 need to be taught. Yeah. And the way you're doing it is the way it should be done. Yeah.
02:55:38.72 --> 02:55:44.08 And, and that was a real, um, you know, obviously that was about as much reassurance as I could get.
02:55:44.08 --> 02:55:48.80 And then, and then you know, just having, uh, having friends that read the book in the, in the,
02:55:48.80 --> 02:55:54.32 in the teams and were like, bro, legit. Good. And then, and then same thing with the podcast. Like,
02:55:54.32 --> 02:55:58.40 when I started, bro, when I started with the podcast, we know what all my friends started like,
02:55:58.40 --> 02:56:04.48 calling me like, dude, that podcast was sick. And everyone, like, that's when I was super stoked, you know,
02:56:04.48 --> 02:56:09.20 because you feel horrible, uh, and you feel like you're shining a spotlight on yourself. Yeah.
02:56:09.20 --> 02:56:15.60 And what I realized was that people saw it. I was actually trying to shine a spotlight, not on me,
02:56:15.60 --> 02:56:22.000 but like, on the community, not even just our community, but the army, the, the Marine Corps,
02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:29.52 to like, every one that is out there working hard is where where the spotlight was trying to be shine.
02:56:29.52 --> 02:56:33.76 It's just that I happened to hold it. Yeah. And it's pretty sketchy to pick that thing up, bro.
02:56:33.76 --> 02:56:39.20 We, I think about this. Think about if there were podcasts going on in the 90s,
02:56:39.20 --> 02:56:43.92 run, we were coming up where we could learn and go and get information on books to read and
02:56:43.92 --> 02:56:48.24 lessons learned from people that were in Vietnam that are talking, hey, here's some things we
02:56:48.24 --> 02:56:51.92 jacked up. We had a blue on blue. I wish I'd have done this. Here's what I did as a leader. There was
02:56:51.92 --> 02:56:55.76 jacked up. I wish I would have, you know, came over and talked to echo on this day. I mean,
02:56:55.76 --> 02:57:02.80 how much better would we? We had, we had nothing. And, and that's, um, believe me, I think about
02:57:02.80 --> 02:57:08.64 that all the time. I mean, even when I, when Mike Thornton came on, yeah, and we did a full debrief.
02:57:09.20 --> 02:57:14.72 I was like, I was in the seal teams for 20 years. Yeah. And I never got that debrief. I never read
02:57:14.72 --> 02:57:20.32 that debrief. Never saw it. No, no, no, no. All those lessons that he learned. Yeah. And it's like,
02:57:20.32 --> 02:57:27.36 wait a second. That's wrong. I felt horrible. Yeah. And so, you know, what now, it's like, oh,
02:57:27.36 --> 02:57:33.84 you can bring on Roger Hayden because Roger Hayden taught me stuff. Yeah. But how is a new guy
02:57:33.84 --> 02:57:39.04 going to learn about Roger Hayden and his lessons? Yeah. Yeah. You know, and it's not even just lessons
02:57:39.04 --> 02:57:45.60 about hey, cover move or hey, keep it simple. It's lessons about hey, when this happens when you
02:57:45.60 --> 02:57:52.000 lose a guy, when you get a guy badly wounded, when you get somebody that's, you know, acting a certain
02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:00.32 way, when someone's losing combat, like all those lessons, being able to learn them is freaking
02:58:00.32 --> 02:58:05.20 so powerful. Yeah. It only helped people out in the future. You know, it's good. I mean, when I had
02:58:05.20 --> 02:58:13.76 James Webb on, who was, you know, Naval Academy Marine Corps Navy Cross, you know, Secretary of
02:58:13.76 --> 02:58:21.44 Navy. But when we got done, and I mean, he, he wrote the book, uh, fields of fire and incredible
02:58:21.44 --> 02:58:28.96 book. And it's sort of the book that all Vietnam movies are based on. Yeah. All, every movie about
02:58:28.96 --> 02:58:34.80 Vietnam is based on that book in one way or another. And it's based, and that book is is a
02:58:34.80 --> 02:58:41.44 thinly disguised autobiography. But when we got done, we walked out and he was like, I
02:58:42.48 --> 02:58:47.68 never got debrief like that. No one ever debriefed anything that I did in Vietnam like that.
02:58:47.68 --> 02:58:53.52 Wow. And he goes, you know, I wrote, there's some stuff written down in some library and the
02:58:53.52 --> 02:59:00.000 12th floor of the Pentagon, you know, row 17, Alpha. He was no one's ever going to read that.
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:08.16 And to be able to debrief like that, it's, you know, he's like, thank you. And he, and he has
02:59:08.16 --> 02:59:15.52 son was in freaking Ramadi. Wow. Wow. So, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm just, and we'll do believe me. I mean,
02:59:15.52 --> 02:59:20.000 I mean, I meet, I meet Marines and Army guys and team guys all the time. They're like, oh, yeah,
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:25.76 episode this episode is freaking awesome. Because just what you just said, we didn't get that opportunity
02:59:25.76 --> 02:59:34.88 to be able to get the debriefs from people and hear these lessons. Yeah. And it's so, we're so lucky
02:59:34.88 --> 02:59:39.60 to be able to do that. It's a powerful learning tool. You know, a lot of things we do just
02:59:39.60 --> 02:59:43.76 your point, the military translate right over to the business world for everyone to learn.
02:59:43.76 --> 02:59:48.96 You know, so then what you get done, you got done with the work on what happened. So,
02:59:48.96 --> 02:59:56.24 got done with the work on and went over. And at that time, we're doing rotations with combined
02:59:56.24 --> 03:00:01.28 joint special operations task force. Task force it goes into Iraq and then, you know, the deal
03:00:01.28 --> 03:00:05.52 with the siege of sort of, you know, their charge of the maneuver elements. Yeah. So, basically,
03:00:05.52 --> 03:00:11.28 this is a group that's in charge of all the special operations in a area. In this case, Iraq. Yeah.
03:00:11.28 --> 03:00:14.72 Yep. So, one up there and I think we had, you know, you're working with all these other
03:00:14.72 --> 03:00:18.80 countries and they're reporting you. We're working together as one big team, one big unit.
03:00:18.80 --> 03:00:23.28 I think we had in between 800 and 1100 people with the siege of sort of, and guys are dispersed
03:00:23.28 --> 03:00:29.92 everyone. This is a point in Iraq where, you know, ISIS has a foothold up in Mosul. And we've got,
03:00:29.92 --> 03:00:35.28 you know, as a first time I actually worked with the Marsock. We had their insoths and their
03:00:35.28 --> 03:00:40.88 insock out there along with the 05 headquarters, they were up north. And we had our NSW unit.
03:00:40.88 --> 03:00:48.40 And they were co-located with us there in Baghdad. And so it was a good experience. You know,
03:00:48.40 --> 03:00:55.44 and we're figuring out, hey, how are we going to take down Mosul? You know, there's been several
03:00:55.44 --> 03:00:58.64 rotations before us where everyone's just waiting. One of the Iraq is going to want to do it. One of
03:00:58.64 --> 03:01:03.52 the Iraqis is going to want to do it. And that came to a head on our deployment, which was good.
03:01:04.56 --> 03:01:09.84 And so, finally, we get approval. Guys come in there and, as a whole year as this is 2016.
03:01:09.84 --> 03:01:17.60 So, you know, guys going there and start clearing out Mosul, you know, at some point, you know,
03:01:17.60 --> 03:01:23.12 one of our seal units rotated out in J and his formation rotated in which is awesome. J,
03:01:23.12 --> 03:01:28.16 J's team was awesome. Having his commanding officer did a great job building that out.
03:01:28.16 --> 03:01:34.16 You know, it was, you know, one of the best seal teams I'd seen. So it was good.
03:01:34.16 --> 03:01:40.40 Anyways, they come in and start clearing Mosul. Me and my boss, we push up to, or beel, and then
03:01:40.40 --> 03:01:44.80 out of or beel, we were running a small jok out of there. So we were co-located with,
03:01:46.24 --> 03:01:52.08 got to forget the sea jok. And the sea jok was the one who could clear airspace to drop
03:01:52.08 --> 03:01:57.36 ordinance. And we needed to be co-located with him to help de-conflict in case anything got snagged up.
03:01:59.60 --> 03:02:03.20 So anyways, there was a lot of connect fighting in there going on at that point.
03:02:03.20 --> 03:02:07.04 But a good experience, we're working with, I think, seven or eight different countries.
03:02:07.04 --> 03:02:10.96 First time I've been inside a sea jok, just sort of working like that. You're up in the upper
03:02:10.96 --> 03:02:15.44 leadership and management position, you know, taking on everything that's going on. I'm trying
03:02:15.44 --> 03:02:21.92 to provide my, my boss with the best advice I can on, you know, what I recommend, you know,
03:02:21.92 --> 03:02:27.84 in the boss I had back then, he's an admiral now, but he was just scored away just, even tempered
03:02:27.84 --> 03:02:31.84 guy, people loved him. The other countries loved him. Like, I wanted to get this guy. I'm like,
03:02:31.84 --> 03:02:35.04 I got my first time work going, but he's dialed in and he had a great reputation, you know.
03:02:36.56 --> 03:02:40.48 So it was, it was, it was a good deployment, you know, and it probably the things that
03:02:40.48 --> 03:02:47.12 weighed the most on that deployment is I'd never really been a part of a ramp ceremony to where you're
03:02:47.12 --> 03:02:54.56 like, you're leaving this thing. And we had one of our war officers, and this was our first ramp
03:02:54.56 --> 03:03:01.20 ceremony. And so we had a pilot that was shot down. I want to say it was 2006 time period and
03:03:01.20 --> 03:03:07.52 his remains were never recovered. And our war officer went off this and he's working with a shake.
03:03:07.52 --> 03:03:11.84 And the shake's going, hey, we got the remains if you want them. And they start doing negotiations.
03:03:11.84 --> 03:03:15.68 And then the shake's like, hey, we want to dismount a money and our guy's going back and forth.
03:03:16.56 --> 03:03:22.16 And in just a point up front, I want to make is when you assign the right person, you know,
03:03:22.16 --> 03:03:28.24 the right talent to that to what you're trying to accomplish, you can get a lot over the finish line.
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:33.28 And I'm saying that up front because there was other agencies that had worked with the shake to try
03:03:33.28 --> 03:03:37.44 to get the remains back. They couldn't get it over the finish line. But here was a guy with never
03:03:37.44 --> 03:03:41.68 done this before. The right temperament, the right attitude went in there and was playing a little
03:03:41.68 --> 03:03:46.16 hardball with this guy, played a little softball over here and he got it over the finish line.
03:03:46.16 --> 03:03:51.76 You know, we wanted to, you know, negotiate with the shake. We got the remains back.
03:03:51.76 --> 03:03:56.16 We went through our ramp ceremony back here and then we got the, you know, the remains back to the
03:03:56.16 --> 03:04:01.44 US who, you know, that officer could be properly buried. And he was, he was a pilot that had been
03:04:01.44 --> 03:04:09.20 shot down. So it was powerful, felt good, you know, felt good. And then we had a few other
03:04:09.20 --> 03:04:15.04 ramp ceremonies. You know, we lost this was one of Jayceo's, these buffers. But he was hit,
03:04:15.04 --> 03:04:20.64 you know, up there in Mosul with an ID and he was killed. And so we did a ramp ceremony
03:04:20.64 --> 03:04:25.92 for him, brought him back. And we had one other guy and I want to tie this back in a
03:04:25.92 --> 03:04:30.96 Romadi, but the third guy we had, he was, you know, he's doing some stuff in another country.
03:04:30.96 --> 03:04:38.40 He was hit hard, he was killed. And we brought him back to us. And it was like the night before
03:04:38.40 --> 03:04:45.68 Thanksgiving back in the US. And in Romadi, we were operating right before Christmas. And, you know,
03:04:45.68 --> 03:04:49.36 the C.J. Soda Commander pulled us out and we were pissed off. We were like, what the hell, man?
03:04:49.36 --> 03:04:53.68 We were planning on being here and through Christmas Eve and through Christmas. And the C.J. Soda
03:04:53.68 --> 03:04:58.48 Commander back in 2006 said, hey, man, I don't want to report back to anyone's family that
03:04:58.48 --> 03:05:03.52 their son was wounded or killed, you know, before Christmas. And then here we are, you know,
03:05:03.52 --> 03:05:09.76 damn near 10 years later. And in Iraq, in this guy gets killed right before Thanksgiving. And his
03:05:09.76 --> 03:05:14.32 family's over with the other family, your wife and kids are over with their family. And they got
03:05:14.32 --> 03:05:18.56 to get notified. We're coming back here, going through all our procedures to make sure everything's
03:05:18.56 --> 03:05:23.60 tightening. He's getting his proper respect before we sent him out. But those things like,
03:05:24.48 --> 03:05:30.24 when you're putting an American on an aircraft in a casket with the flag draped over, man,
03:05:30.24 --> 03:05:36.32 it's just, it's a gut punch, man. It sucks. It sucks, man. It's something I never, you know,
03:05:36.32 --> 03:05:49.60 wish upon anyone. And it really gets home to you, you know, not good.
03:05:51.92 --> 03:05:59.60 How long was that deployment? That was a six-month-tor. And the Iraqis took massive casualties on
03:05:59.60 --> 03:06:04.72 the planet. Before we left, they were like the special, you know, we were working with and it
03:06:04.72 --> 03:06:09.44 trained up over the years. The SF actually trained in well, but they could be at a hand of the
03:06:09.44 --> 03:06:14.72 pie somewhere in there. But they were dialed in. They were the best unit that the Iraqis had. And these
03:06:14.72 --> 03:06:20.64 guys had a lot of pride, but they were like over 800 casualties when we left. And the aides,
03:06:20.64 --> 03:06:28.000 this deal was, I mean, ISIS was no joke over there, man. They were barbaric, brutal. And, you know,
03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:33.12 there's a, there's a fraction of people where you think you're going to come in. You're going to
03:06:33.12 --> 03:06:38.88 talk some sense into some people like that. You're not, you're not talking to them. And if they
03:06:38.88 --> 03:06:42.64 get a hold of you, it's not going to be good for you. You're going to get your head chopped off.
03:06:43.44 --> 03:06:48.08 And that's the type of, that's what you're dealing with over there. And those, you know,
03:06:48.08 --> 03:06:53.20 that unit that our guys were working with, they later it all out there. They're going in there
03:06:53.20 --> 03:06:58.88 for their country for Iraq to secure that city, to make it a better place. And man, they took heavy
03:06:58.88 --> 03:07:09.60 casualties. I mean, heavy casualties. You know, the, the truck bombs, they built from 2004 to 2016,
03:07:09.60 --> 03:07:14.16 they up armored them in 2016. So when they're coming at you, there's no way, there's not a good
03:07:14.16 --> 03:07:18.80 way to defeat them. You need some type of missile system or rocket system coming in on top.
03:07:19.52 --> 03:07:23.28 Or you need some type of arresting device to where you can stop the vehicle from coming at you.
03:07:23.28 --> 03:07:29.04 You know, we had some good penetration with some of our heavy caliber weapons. We'll stop
03:07:29.04 --> 03:07:36.64 them, but it was hard. It was not easy. And in date, hide them underneath, vehicle or carport
03:07:38.32 --> 03:07:41.92 entry points. And you wouldn't be able to tell what it is. And next thing you know, that big
03:07:41.92 --> 03:07:46.72 huge truck bomb is on the move. And there's a farmer at all over the place. And there's just a small
03:07:46.72 --> 03:07:52.24 window that they can look out. And guess what, if they come off the seat or anything happens with the
03:07:52.24 --> 03:07:56.32 seat and their adjustment, the things rigged to just blow. So as soon as it hits something,
03:07:56.32 --> 03:08:01.04 the whole thing is going up. And man, we just remember watching CTSU and it's a damn thing
03:08:01.04 --> 03:08:05.60 it'd become. You'd be trying to call in an air strike. But you got like a minute and 30 seconds
03:08:05.60 --> 03:08:10.80 to clear airspace overhead to get bombs down on targets. So you'd just like, it wasn't going to happen.
03:08:10.80 --> 03:08:16.24 So you had to be able to handle business as a tactical unit on the ground to take this thing out.
03:08:16.24 --> 03:08:21.52 You know, we give these guys rockets and ship, but they weren't effective. So it was a super
03:08:21.52 --> 03:08:27.44 complex and frustrating environment, you know, took a lot of casualties.
03:08:28.16 --> 03:08:34.88 Yeah, no Jason was saying that, you know, at a certain point they were thinking that the Iraqi
03:08:34.88 --> 03:08:39.36 unit that was doing the majority of the fighting was just going to run out of guys. Like they just
03:08:39.36 --> 03:08:45.04 were going to, they were just going to all be dead or all be casualties, which was freaking scary.
03:08:45.04 --> 03:08:49.76 And I was horrified when he was telling me that. And I was hearing some of that while,
03:08:49.76 --> 03:08:54.40 you guys were actually over there. But at the same time, even though it kind of horrified me,
03:08:54.40 --> 03:09:00.88 at the same time, I also was this going to sound wrong, but I was happy to hear it
03:09:01.76 --> 03:09:08.48 because what it told me was that the Iraqis were fighting. Yeah. And when we were in
03:09:08.48 --> 03:09:14.64 Ramadi, the Iraqis, they, they, some of them would fight, but it definitely wasn't. They weren't
03:09:14.64 --> 03:09:20.24 looking to take massive casualties to try and take a city back. Like they didn't care that much. And
03:09:20.24 --> 03:09:25.84 they would run away. We had a whole battalion, a whole battalion to Iraqis soldiers said, yeah,
03:09:25.84 --> 03:09:32.000 we're out. Well, we had one entire company disappear. Like there was a strike on their on one of
03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:37.68 their checkpoints. And they all just bailed. That was that. So to hear how hard the Iraqis were fighting.
03:09:37.68 --> 03:09:41.76 And they were taking it to ISIS and that they were staying in the fight. That was just freaking
03:09:41.76 --> 03:09:45.84 um, that was just, it was awesome to hear that. It was so horrible to hear that they were taking
03:09:45.84 --> 03:09:51.04 casualties, but it was great to hear that they had found the will to fight and that they were
03:09:51.04 --> 03:10:00.80 unified and, and fighting courageously to to liberate other Iraqis inside their country from
03:10:01.20 --> 03:10:08.56 these actual savages that are doing the most hate committing the most heinous atrocities
03:10:08.56 --> 03:10:15.28 imaginable. And it was all it was awesome to hear that they were fighting like that. And it was also,
03:10:15.28 --> 03:10:22.56 you know, when ISIS decided to, you know, wear a uniform and put up flags. It was like right on.
03:10:23.20 --> 03:10:30.48 Let's see how this works out for you. Yeah. Fried them legit. And then what?
03:10:31.20 --> 03:10:36.08 Then what? So finish up with that deployment, get back off of that. And then that's when I rolled
03:10:36.08 --> 03:10:42.96 over to group one. And so, you know, started, you know, I got a good six, six month of getting
03:10:42.96 --> 03:10:48.000 saturated with group level stuff. And, you know, at the group, you're responsible for all, you know,
03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:52.80 four West Coast seal teams and three other commands. So you got roughly right around 1,800 people
03:10:52.80 --> 03:10:57.76 or so. And your primary function there is manning training in equipment. So I'm working directly
03:10:57.76 --> 03:11:03.36 with the team command master chiefs on some occasions there are commanding officers. And so
03:11:03.36 --> 03:11:07.76 you're in a position of a lot of influence at that point. You know, and I'm directly working with
03:11:07.76 --> 03:11:14.40 our Commodore on on our initiatives and moving the mission forward. And you're also dealing with
03:11:14.96 --> 03:11:20.40 whatever sort of, you know, equipment, like trying to get equipment for the guys, trying to just
03:11:20.40 --> 03:11:27.44 the whole nine yards. And overall responsible for their training. Did you go out to the desert during
03:11:27.44 --> 03:11:31.52 that time? We're not there a couple times. Damn bro. And it's just so it's weird. It's different.
03:11:31.52 --> 03:11:37.36 When you're up at that level, when you come down in, it's never the same. It's never, you know,
03:11:37.36 --> 03:11:41.12 you're the guy show for you. Yeah, you're the guy. Then it's like, hey, I'm coming in there to
03:11:41.12 --> 03:11:45.20 see this. And you're like, and man, you guys might want to tighten this shit up over here, you know,
03:11:45.20 --> 03:11:52.48 but it was good, you know, damn who's there? I think Jay, yeah, Jay was it traded at the time.
03:11:52.48 --> 03:11:56.64 So it was good. So Jay was always there right hand man, I had out there and we had a good
03:11:56.64 --> 03:12:01.52 crew of a team committed master chiefs. And one of the things we started doing back in
03:12:02.24 --> 03:12:07.52 2015 with the force I was working with, the force command master chief, as you started implementing
03:12:07.52 --> 03:12:12.48 a screening process. So we were basically going through a hiring to make sure that we were
03:12:12.48 --> 03:12:17.84 getting the right leaders in at the master chief level to take over some of these command positions.
03:12:18.40 --> 03:12:21.44 And it's not perfect, but it was a hell of a lot better than where we were.
03:12:21.44 --> 03:12:26.72 And they also, we also started implementing then, you know, Patoon Chief and TASC unit
03:12:26.72 --> 03:12:31.76 seniorless advisor screening. And that was developing. So it's, it's getting better as a move
03:12:31.76 --> 03:12:35.28 forward. Bottom line is, you know, things are getting better. Your movement thanks forward.
03:12:35.28 --> 03:12:40.96 That's what you want for a better formation. You know, and just going back to work on real quick,
03:12:41.76 --> 03:12:45.20 one of the things I realized when you're up there, you know, when you're down in the troops,
03:12:45.20 --> 03:12:49.20 you're just like, give me my gear. I want to get go to war and do all these things. And
03:12:49.20 --> 03:12:53.52 people talk a lot of shit about everyone above them. And here's the deal with the people that are
03:12:53.52 --> 03:13:00.16 above you. I'm you. I was the E5 talking that shit saying all those things. And guess what? I moved
03:13:00.16 --> 03:13:05.36 up positions, but I moved up in positions to take care of people. Right? And so there's a lot of
03:13:05.36 --> 03:13:09.68 cookie things that come out. You're the guy behind the scenes, squashing these things, you know,
03:13:09.68 --> 03:13:14.64 to make sure that there are people that are taking care of. And I always had, I had a buddy that was,
03:13:14.64 --> 03:13:18.40 you know, he was a hard case. And he's like, hey, man, won't you ever see this?
03:13:18.40 --> 03:13:21.68 Won't you, you need to stand up and say something about that? I'm like, hey, man, I'm handling
03:13:21.68 --> 03:13:26.80 that shit behind closed doors. I'm not going to come here and open form with the commander and disagree
03:13:26.80 --> 03:13:32.000 with them and front of all these people. And that's not smart. I'm getting nowhere. Yeah. But if I come
03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:36.88 around the backside, you're doing a little flank, plant some seeds. You can have a lot more influence
03:13:36.88 --> 03:13:41.92 that way. So anyways, you're always going to get that shit with the hard cases. You know what I'm talking about?
03:13:41.92 --> 03:13:47.20 Yeah. And then how long was that tour? So that was a two-year tour. Yeah. I wanted to finish up my career
03:13:47.20 --> 03:13:53.52 there and towards the end, you're like, I mean, what were you thinking? What was on the horizon
03:13:53.52 --> 03:13:58.40 and what was your decision making process to decide to punch? Punch. Yes. So I punched
03:13:58.40 --> 03:14:02.24 right at like the 28 and a half year mark. So I could have gone another year and a half, but
03:14:02.24 --> 03:14:06.40 man, I was out of juice. And one of the things people talk about is, hey, you know, when it's time
03:14:06.40 --> 03:14:11.84 to go and man, I was in that position and we had some high profile cases out there and they just
03:14:11.84 --> 03:14:17.36 wear on your man, you know, they just wear on you. And even before that happened, I knew it was time
03:14:17.36 --> 03:14:21.28 for me to go, oh my god, I don't want to do this position. It's time for me to move out of here.
03:14:21.28 --> 03:14:26.56 I don't think I had anything left to add value to the mission and the organization. I was
03:14:26.56 --> 03:14:31.68 topped out with my leadership capacity. And we have plenty guys that go out there and do the T-Sawks,
03:14:31.68 --> 03:14:35.60 you know, the theater special operations command and that's a high level of influence. Those
03:14:35.60 --> 03:14:41.68 are action arms in the operational areas. And I was like, man, I just don't see myself going and
03:14:41.68 --> 03:14:45.44 working at that level. You're working with general officers with admiral's and I was like, man,
03:14:45.44 --> 03:14:50.24 I just, I was up at Warcom, kind of got a little bit of a taste of that. And I was like,
03:14:50.24 --> 03:14:55.12 that's just not me. And we need people to do those positions. So we had quite a few East Coast
03:14:55.12 --> 03:15:01.28 guys going into those T-Sawks positions and you need them because that's a huge high level of
03:15:01.28 --> 03:15:07.04 influence that we have in NSW. If you have your guy in there, he can help influence some outcomes,
03:15:07.04 --> 03:15:14.56 which is super important. But I was definitely matched out out of gas time for me to pack up and go home.
03:15:15.36 --> 03:15:23.20 And one of the things that always comes to mind with me is in 2003, you know, we had Posi out there
03:15:23.20 --> 03:15:27.84 or Vietnam guy, good dude, man, just good family guy, Vietnam had more stores and you can imagine.
03:15:27.84 --> 03:15:35.68 But he was like, man, Steve, you guys are stronger, faster, smarter than we ever were.
03:15:35.68 --> 03:15:40.96 I was like, dang what's he talking about? And then I looked back, you know, 28, you know, 15 years
03:15:40.96 --> 03:15:45.52 later, whatever it was. And I'm like these young guys that are coming in, they're hungry,
03:15:45.52 --> 03:15:50.48 they're smarter, they're stronger than I was. They're faster than I was, meaning they
03:15:50.48 --> 03:15:54.48 the communities in a good spot. We got our next generation coming up and through our ranks,
03:15:54.48 --> 03:16:00.96 doing good things. You know, one of the things, one of our head leaders for the Navy put out
03:16:01.60 --> 03:16:06.88 Macpond Stevens, he said, hey, work hard, stay out of trouble and be a good person. That's all I'm
03:16:06.88 --> 03:16:11.20 asking the formation to do. The entire Navy, that was his mantra. Work hard, stay out of trouble,
03:16:11.20 --> 03:16:17.60 be a good and be a good and decent human being, be a good person. And I never knew what the
03:16:17.60 --> 03:16:23.12 healthy meant by stay out of trouble. And then, you know, as you start moving up in these positions
03:16:23.12 --> 03:16:28.64 and you have high profile cases and things going on, they can bring your entire community down to
03:16:28.64 --> 03:16:34.48 its knees, meaning it's hard to move initiatives forward. It's hard to focus on what your actual
03:16:34.48 --> 03:16:39.76 job is because you're dealing with, you know, in JP you're dealing with court marshals, all those
03:16:39.76 --> 03:16:47.76 things weigh on you and it's never good. In my boss in 2015, our four C, he hammered it home to me
03:16:47.76 --> 03:16:52.40 and it made sense. He said, hey Steve, we've got a protect emission, we've got to protect our
03:16:52.40 --> 03:16:57.28 credibility, credibility, it's built, know the people's blood, it was built, know the people's blood,
03:16:57.28 --> 03:17:01.60 we've got to protect that at all cost. And he's like it's hard for us to protect the homeland
03:17:01.60 --> 03:17:07.20 if we've got, if our credibility's damaged and we can't get employed overseas to wrap up bad guys.
03:17:07.20 --> 03:17:14.48 And I was like, yeah, check, that ship makes sense. So, yeah, well, that's the same thing as a
03:17:14.48 --> 03:17:18.24 reputation, right? Yeah. The community has a reputation and you've got to do everything you can to
03:17:18.24 --> 03:17:25.84 protect that reputation because if you're, yeah, just, just what you have to do and you do your best.
03:17:26.48 --> 03:17:30.40 You do everything you can to protect the reputation. I mean, that's what you got to do, you know.
03:17:32.08 --> 03:17:35.92 Man, any other echo, you got anything?
03:17:38.96 --> 03:17:43.92 Said something about a firecracker earlier, like firecracker scenario or whatever and you were like,
03:17:43.92 --> 03:17:48.72 oh, you got the firecracker right off the bat or something like that, like that was the nickname. It was the
03:17:48.72 --> 03:17:57.44 nickname for an area in Ramadi that was north of Route Michigan and it was this little road that
03:17:57.44 --> 03:18:01.76 wrapped up in the round. It was called firecracker and the reason it was called firecracker was because
03:18:01.76 --> 03:18:06.72 there was a lot of bad shit going on here. There was a lot of fire like a lot of firecracking off
03:18:06.72 --> 03:18:12.32 and as you said. Interesting. Okay. And that was like your first, that was our first
03:18:12.32 --> 03:18:17.52 operation and Ramadi. Dude, that's a welcome to Ramadi situation right there. Damn.
03:18:18.72 --> 03:18:25.12 It was good. That was good. That's a lot. Freaking crazy. Anything else Steve? Any closing thoughts?
03:18:28.24 --> 03:18:34.08 No, that's it. Right all man. Well, thanks for coming on, man. Yeah.
03:18:35.68 --> 03:18:40.16 Oh, you know what I'll say one more thing at one point, probably you were like six months out from
03:18:40.16 --> 03:18:44.88 retiring and you said I have three courses of action for what I'm going to do and I get out
03:18:46.48 --> 03:18:51.12 echelon front echelon front echelon front. I was like right all man. Pretty good. Awesome.
03:18:51.84 --> 03:18:58.72 Which is a rip off from the marine that I covered the book on the podcast where when he was
03:18:58.72 --> 03:19:06.64 getting ready to graduate from the basics school and they had to fill out what they wanted to do
03:19:06.64 --> 03:19:12.000 and this was the 1967 that it fell out what they wanted to do in the Marine Corps and he put one,
03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:16.40 two, three infantry, two commander infantry, two commander infantry, two commander. It's like that's
03:19:16.40 --> 03:19:20.80 what I'm going to do. I was like, Roger that. All right. Yes, we're going to execute on this thing.
03:19:20.80 --> 03:19:27.28 So it's freaking awesome. Thanks for what you did to the teams for the teams. Obviously for America,
03:19:27.28 --> 03:19:33.28 obviously and and and for freedom and I know we had an awesome time working together in the past. I
03:19:33.28 --> 03:19:39.28 still I just when I drive at night whenever I drive at night, especially out here in California,
03:19:39.28 --> 03:19:44.88 the desert, I'm always thinking I'm driving back from from the desert from our desert training facility
03:19:44.88 --> 03:19:51.12 and just with just totally amped because I wouldn't be able to sleep because I'd be so fired up
03:19:51.12 --> 03:19:58.000 from the teams and for the boys and I'd be like just amped driving back, knowing that we made some
03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:04.16 freaking guys ready for war. So it was awesome working with you then and awesome working with you again
03:20:04.16 --> 03:20:10.000 right now, man. Yeah, I really appreciate it. I'm glad to be on with with Eshelon front. It's awesome.
03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:14.000 Can I say one thing real quick? Yeah. Yeah, I like to thank my wife, Allison. She's put up with me
03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:20.80 for all these years. She's prior military. Good southern girl from Arkansas and she runs a tight
03:20:20.80 --> 03:20:26.32 game. She keeps me and she keeps me in line. So I love with all my heart. She's an awesome person.
03:20:26.32 --> 03:20:34.80 And my kids, I love you guys. Right, oh, man. Awesome. Well, echo. Yes, sir. Speaking of
03:20:37.20 --> 03:20:42.48 getting after it. Speaking or speaking of being awesome. What do you think we can do to
03:20:43.76 --> 03:20:49.12 become more awesome to strive? Strived. Strived for awesomeness at the very least. How about that?
03:20:49.12 --> 03:20:55.28 Strived. There's some podcast we did from some ancient warrior. Shaking the world with your
03:20:55.28 --> 03:21:02.64 awesomeness. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, that's a big step. Good striving to shaking the world.
03:21:02.64 --> 03:21:07.36 Hmm. Same thing. Like that's kind of a big step for sure. So let's start with striving. Cool.
03:21:07.36 --> 03:21:14.64 Good. All right. Well, hey, in your path to strive for awesomeness more and the event that you're
03:21:14.64 --> 03:21:20.32 just straight up trying to shake the world with awesomeness. Hey, look, you might need some supplementation.
03:21:20.32 --> 03:21:28.000 Okay, let me let me start this by Steve, you know, you listen to the podcast. Yes. How often do you
03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:36.96 listen to this part of the podcast? What percentage of time? I'm probably 50%. 50% you'll let you hang on.
03:21:36.96 --> 03:21:43.60 I'm hang on. Or is it just you can't hit stop on your freaking iPhone? So you just have to go with it. It's like stuff.
03:21:43.60 --> 03:21:47.52 There's so many new products coming out. You've got to listen to it. To kind of go, all right.
03:21:47.52 --> 03:21:54.24 Is there some new line coming out here on my track? Oh, yeah. Let's do it. He makes it good. So so he's saying 50% my guess.
03:21:54.24 --> 03:21:58.24 He's kind of rounding up to be nice because you know, he doesn't want to be like harsh to act.
03:21:58.24 --> 03:22:03.20 That's cool. All of a sudden he is 1%. That's right. He's a little bit at 50. She does 49.
03:22:03.20 --> 03:22:08.000 Here's what I know. I just got a text from JP and and Dave Burke. They want to know if you're going to talk about
03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:15.04 their discipline. Go some sour apple snipals. You mean good deal. Dave. Good deal. Dave. Okay. JP just just tracking on it.
03:22:15.04 --> 03:22:20.56 Yeah. By tracking that Steve's here and then sending taking the time to send a text to say,
03:22:20.56 --> 03:22:25.60 hey, make sure you talk about sour apple sniper. Okay. Dave wants to make JP jealousy.
03:22:25.60 --> 03:22:30.40 You got to mention Dave's afterburner. Okay. No problem. We're on it fully.
03:22:31.04 --> 03:22:36.16 These two guys are just breaking in the game. That's all man. That's all.
03:22:36.16 --> 03:22:40.96 And I dig it. Either way, before we get to the discipline or discipline, go, which are, you know,
03:22:40.96 --> 03:22:44.40 they're kind of different but kind of the same. We're talking about joint supplements.
03:22:45.20 --> 03:22:48.32 It's important because you don't want to think about this kind of stuff while we're trying to
03:22:48.32 --> 03:22:53.36 watch shake the world with, you know, weapons or striver, whatever. You don't want to think about your
03:22:53.36 --> 03:22:56.96 joints. You don't want to think about your immunity getting sick all this kind of stuff. So you take
03:22:56.96 --> 03:23:04.08 these supplements. Join warfare. Join super cruel oil. Joins. Vitamin D3 immunity and general health
03:23:04.08 --> 03:23:10.64 by the way. Vitamin D3 is good for a lot of stuff. All kinds, especially at this moment in time in
03:23:10.64 --> 03:23:18.56 particular, we're talking about factual information about the glory of the vitamin D. It's true.
03:23:18.56 --> 03:23:24.96 Absolutely true. Also cold war immunity supplement. Keep those in mind. So you don't have to
03:23:24.96 --> 03:23:29.68 keep the other stuff in mind. Well, yeah, that's when you've, you've finally gotten through to me.
03:23:29.68 --> 03:23:38.80 It's only taken 260 episodes of a beat. Now I understand that you're like, oh, it's good to not have
03:23:38.80 --> 03:23:44.48 to think about your joint spottering you. Yes. That's a good thing. That is a good thing. So now I understand
03:23:45.36 --> 03:23:51.60 we don't want to wake up and be like, I hope my joints hold up today and work out or whatever.
03:23:51.60 --> 03:23:55.52 It seems to be. Yes. You just want to go into the workout or my people. We want to get it done. Let's
03:23:55.52 --> 03:24:03.20 say exactly right. Also, we have something I may call discipline to supplement for your brain,
03:24:03.20 --> 03:24:08.24 for your body, for your whole thing, really life, your life, man, your life, powder,
03:24:10.32 --> 03:24:14.80 take discipline powder instead of coffee. Try that. Good call. It could be something.
03:24:14.80 --> 03:24:19.20 This is what I'm saying as far as the routine. Also, discipline go, which are and or should I say
03:24:19.20 --> 03:24:26.16 where capsules to begin when they are capsules. This is your on the go. Yes. Did that. They're
03:24:26.16 --> 03:24:32.56 very popular at echelom front. Can I see something on the discipline go capsules? Hey, so I've been
03:24:32.56 --> 03:24:36.40 using that stuff. And so when I'm going in and I'm doing a speaking engagement, that's why they're
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:42.64 so popular. I take two. And here's the deal. When I'm communicating, when I'm not taking that
03:24:42.64 --> 03:24:47.36 stuff, it's like I'm going down the highway and I really have to think hard about the words I'm
03:24:47.36 --> 03:24:53.28 going to communicate. It's like the words are in off the shoot off a street. When I'm on the discipline
03:24:53.28 --> 03:24:57.68 go, the words are right there. On the road, I'm going 60 miles an hour. You're like boom,
03:24:57.68 --> 03:25:02.40 boom, clearic and size communications. And I don't know what's in it, but it definitely clears up
03:25:02.40 --> 03:25:08.32 your mind. It clears up your mind. It works. You got to get, I'm telling you, if you're a boss,
03:25:08.32 --> 03:25:13.28 you got some things going on, a meeting, a high speed meeting, you're talking to people. It helps.
03:25:13.28 --> 03:25:18.32 I promise you it helps. I wouldn't say if it did. Yeah, no, that's why that's why at Eshelon
03:25:18.32 --> 03:25:22.64 front where we get up and we have to not only we have to speak, but we got to take questions and
03:25:22.64 --> 03:25:27.04 trip questions. We got to come up with answers and solutions. And so the team is always like,
03:25:27.04 --> 03:25:33.92 yeah, yeah, I'm going to, I want to bring the A game. Right? How do you ensure you bring the A game?
03:25:33.92 --> 03:25:40.16 Take a little discipline go. And then if you have like a little more time or maybe you want to
03:25:40.16 --> 03:25:47.76 enjoy that a little bit more. You can get a can of discipline go. Yes, which is what you mentioned.
03:25:47.76 --> 03:25:54.24 Right? Many flavors now. It's true. The flavor roster getting big over here. So most recently,
03:25:54.24 --> 03:26:02.72 afterburner orange, good deal. Dave Burke, boom, before that sour apple sniper. JP didn't know
03:26:02.72 --> 03:26:07.68 what are they competing with each other? Oh, good. There's some competition before that.
03:26:07.68 --> 03:26:15.68 Jocco Palmer, which by the way, which by the way, Jocco Palmer, Jocco Palmer is not. Jocco Palmer,
03:26:15.68 --> 03:26:22.08 what it is is it's 50 50, iced tea lemonade. That's what it is. Yeah. Some people were thinking
03:26:22.08 --> 03:26:27.76 it was pomegranate because we also have Jocco, pomegranate, white tea. Yeah, which which you probably
03:26:27.76 --> 03:26:33.68 remember Steve. Yeah. Tell us about that's the origin story right there. At Nyland,
03:26:33.68 --> 03:26:41.84 me rolling into those briefs with that big old plastic protein shaker with freaking with pomegranate
03:26:41.84 --> 03:26:45.44 tea, which I would get from wherever and then I'd just sit there in the front row and they'd give
03:26:45.44 --> 03:26:54.40 their brief and check to just take it notes. You give your points or actually like you know
03:26:54.40 --> 03:26:58.80 whatever. The front line instructors would give their points and then you'd give your points and then
03:26:58.80 --> 03:27:08.24 be like, be like, got anything bossed by back. Oh, there's just a little bit. Yeah,
03:27:08.24 --> 03:27:13.84 this little thing. Yeah, so speaking to caffeine and just a little bit, yes, Jocco Palmer,
03:27:13.84 --> 03:27:19.68 that was the one before that and then before that was what, who's the first signature, oh,
03:27:19.68 --> 03:27:24.96 DAX have it just the first signature was DAX average. Dakota, tasty. Is that your go-to? What's your
03:27:24.96 --> 03:27:31.04 go-to? I like the DAX average. I like the story behind DAX average. Yeah, dude, he's a monster. If you
03:27:31.04 --> 03:27:38.32 can just get a little bit of mentality of Dakota, then your whole, your whole being is better.
03:27:39.20 --> 03:27:45.92 Not enough, no offense to J.P. and Dave. I don't know how to have bad mentalities too. But let's face it.
03:27:45.92 --> 03:27:51.28 DAX average. It's freaking Dakota. What kind of end the game? Dakota's kind of take, do you,
03:27:51.28 --> 03:27:56.32 did you drink Dr. Pepper when you were a kid? I did not. Because that's kind of the, yeah,
03:27:56.32 --> 03:28:02.88 it's kind of the flavor apparently. It's tasting. Yeah, that's my, that's my wife's favorite. Yeah.
03:28:02.88 --> 03:28:08.08 Which, what do you think of that Dakota? I see you tracking on my life. You tracking,
03:28:08.08 --> 03:28:13.44 tracking on my life Dakota. Yeah, so that one's kind of a sour apple sniper is,
03:28:14.88 --> 03:28:19.12 I'm going to say if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth, probably sour apple sniper's your go-to.
03:28:19.12 --> 03:28:26.16 It's true. Dr. Pepper is, if you like, ice tea and lemonade. Yeah, that was my favorite before
03:28:26.16 --> 03:28:32.72 the orange. The orange is your favorite. Currently my favorite. Yeah, Mr. But hey, man, you know, teach their own
03:28:32.72 --> 03:28:37.92 and we're going to move forward. So what this is though, discipline go in a can, energy drink,
03:28:37.92 --> 03:28:44.32 health energy drink, healthy energy drink, no health drink in the form of energy drink. Yeah,
03:28:44.32 --> 03:28:50.48 it's been hard to figure out what to call it. Whatever you are just saying, Steve was pretty
03:28:50.48 --> 03:28:55.60 legit about just going down the road, finding words and everything. No, okay, so I'm like, yeah,
03:28:55.60 --> 03:29:01.28 I know what your feeling is. Yeah, and that's what makes like the, the can so good. Because you're
03:29:01.28 --> 03:29:06.16 not like, let's face it. You're just doing whatever during the day, whatever we do during the day.
03:29:06.16 --> 03:29:12.64 You're like, oh, you know, I'll grab a water or grab a juice, grab a soda, sometimes, some of us,
03:29:12.64 --> 03:29:18.56 no, this, this exactly right though. This is like you can grab it. No, you don't get the bad parts of
03:29:18.56 --> 03:29:22.72 soda. Yeah, you know, I mean, yeah, if you're going for a water cool man, do it. But if you're
03:29:22.72 --> 03:29:29.20 grabbing like a red bull, or I shouldn't say any particular brand, but you're grabbing a soda or
03:29:29.20 --> 03:29:33.84 a energy drink, just saying you're going to pay a price for that. Your pain of price,
03:29:33.84 --> 03:29:39.20 your pain of price with your health. Yeah, and with this discipline, go, it's pain you would think
03:29:39.20 --> 03:29:44.40 that somebody would have already made an equivalent, right? You would think you'd think that.
03:29:44.40 --> 03:29:48.32 It's real obvious. Hey, I'm going to make something that makes you a enhances your performance,
03:29:48.32 --> 03:29:52.40 but it's actually good for you. You'd think somebody would have met done that. Why didn't they do it?
03:29:52.40 --> 03:29:56.88 Number one, cost too much. Another, now they're not making, they're not maximizing profits at
03:29:56.88 --> 03:30:02.88 the freaking cash register. Yeah, that's true. And number two is hard. It was hard to do because we
03:30:02.88 --> 03:30:06.32 had to instead of just throwing a bunch of chemicals in there. So it wouldn't go bad. We had to
03:30:06.32 --> 03:30:12.40 pasteize it, which no one does. So there you go. And you're not only that, hey, well, how you
03:30:12.40 --> 03:30:17.04 going to make it taste good? Well, we'll just put a bunch of chemicals in there that are bad for you,
03:30:17.04 --> 03:30:20.72 but they'll make people taste good. And we don't care about the people that we're serving this, too.
03:30:20.72 --> 03:30:28.96 So we'll just let them drink poison. What did we do? We said, I was like, no, we're not doing that.
03:30:28.96 --> 03:30:34.56 We're going to sweeten it with something real, it's monk fruit. So that's why it doesn't even
03:30:34.56 --> 03:30:38.32 that doesn't seem like a lot of barriers to entry, right? Like, hey, we're going to pass tries.
03:30:38.32 --> 03:30:42.56 They're, we're going to put, we're going to sweeten it naturally. We're going to only put healthy
03:30:42.56 --> 03:30:48.32 ingredients in it. You'd think that those, those bars to entry aren't that high. You'd think someone
03:30:48.32 --> 03:30:54.80 would have done it, but they didn't, they didn't do it. So we did. Like I said, now everyone else can
03:30:54.80 --> 03:31:01.04 get in line. As far as getting in line goes for sure. Also speaking of tasting good, monk,
03:31:01.04 --> 03:31:09.84 some pure your protein and the form of a dessert. So you know, you know, I such a good dessert.
03:31:09.84 --> 03:31:15.76 Yeah, very much so so, I don't even know if I'm supposed to say this, but Brian sends my son and me.
03:31:16.40 --> 03:31:20.80 I'm more of a secondary thing, but it sends my son, monk bars. Oh yeah. I don't know if
03:31:20.80 --> 03:31:25.36 they're still in the experimental stage. The version that you're getting right now is pretty close to a
03:31:25.36 --> 03:31:31.28 done deal. Yeah. So it's like it's one of those things where you get man, if you want to dessert,
03:31:31.92 --> 03:31:36.56 like monk is the dessert and it's super as far as like, you know, like sometimes you're like,
03:31:36.56 --> 03:31:40.96 I need a dessert, but I, you know, I'm on the pass. So I'm going to have a dessert substitute or something
03:31:40.96 --> 03:31:44.72 like this. You know what I'm saying? You had those out. I thought those were out already.
03:31:44.72 --> 03:31:51.36 Mostly bars. Yeah, was eating something back in December last year. We were in the experimental phase.
03:31:51.36 --> 03:31:56.32 Well, they were tasty. Yeah. They've gotten better. Wow. They've gotten better. So it's been hard,
03:31:56.32 --> 03:32:00.64 man. It's been really hard. There's a, it's the same. It's the same kind of battles you're fighting
03:32:01.20 --> 03:32:06.000 with the, like, with, with making the drink and how do you actually keep it stable? There's more,
03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:09.60 there's, well, it's not more, but there's different things in play trying to make a bar. How do you
03:32:09.60 --> 03:32:13.36 keep it stable? How does it maintain its texture over time? What happens when it's sitting on the
03:32:13.36 --> 03:32:17.04 shelf for two months? There's a bunch of things to deal with. So we find in the version that you're
03:32:17.04 --> 03:32:22.32 getting right now. Echo, we find we figured out how to overcome all that and do it naturally and
03:32:22.32 --> 03:32:29.12 make it taste good and have the right flavor profile and stay stable on the shelf. So it's been a
03:32:29.12 --> 03:32:34.08 long road. It's been a road that we almost back away from. And you know me, I'm not one to,
03:32:35.28 --> 03:32:40.96 DOR. DOR is this. Sure. Yeah. But either way, yes,
03:32:40.96 --> 03:32:48.08 smoke, protein, the form of dessert, not a dessert substitute by the way. Just simply dessert. Straight up.
03:32:48.08 --> 03:32:55.68 Where do you get all this stuff? Origin main.com originally originally as many other places to get it,
03:32:55.68 --> 03:33:00.32 but before we go there, okay, let's go here. Jocco, wait, you mentioned the Pumagranto,
03:33:00.32 --> 03:33:05.44 wait, T. Jocco, wait, T. That is available. We're not just talking about Jocco, you used to drink
03:33:05.44 --> 03:33:11.76 white tea now. He doesn't. Yeah. Drink even better. I had a double white tea. Yeah, remember you
03:33:11.76 --> 03:33:17.84 still drink it in that big jar. So bring the big jar. Oh, I just bring it back in the day. Like a crazy person.
03:33:17.84 --> 03:33:25.04 Yeah. Yeah. Nonetheless, yes, that's available as well at origami.com also at the Vitamin Shop offline.
03:33:26.48 --> 03:33:32.40 What do you call it like brick and retail? Yeah, boom, Vitamin Shop, go get it. Also,
03:33:32.40 --> 03:33:38.64 the discipline go cans. All right, wow, wow. In Florida currently. Yeah. And by the way, if you live in Florida
03:33:39.28 --> 03:33:45.76 and you've been and look, I ask and said, hey, please, this is the mission. We want to we want to go
03:33:45.76 --> 03:33:52.32 into the full chain of rawa. We needed to go hard in Florida. We needed to go in there clear shelves.
03:33:52.32 --> 03:33:58.64 Well, you all that I've been clearing shelves. Thank you. Keep going. We're on the path to victory.
03:33:58.64 --> 03:34:06.56 Don't let up. Let's keep getting after it. Because you know why? Because people in Pennsylvania
03:34:06.56 --> 03:34:12.88 and New Jersey and Maryland, they're they're counting on Florida. It's all eyes on Florida. We got a rock
03:34:12.88 --> 03:34:19.28 and roll in Florida. We're on the right path. Don't let up. But it's true. And the thing is again,
03:34:19.28 --> 03:34:24.96 I said it for it's kind of a big deal though to go and get like an energy drink or whatever and it
03:34:24.96 --> 03:34:30.40 be legitimate and healthy for you. It's guys a huge deal. I like you didn't even really have to think about.
03:34:30.40 --> 03:34:34.88 But it might be just went back. I mean, we were talking about that 15 minutes ago, but we're talking
03:34:34.88 --> 03:34:39.92 about it again. That's cool. I don't think I'm a capitalite, not capitalized. I broke down the entire thing
03:34:39.92 --> 03:34:44.000 about the bars and the thing we got to do and how hard it was. Yeah, but that wasn't good enough.
03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:48.80 But not about the price you pay when you when you take drink and energy drink or a soda or something like this.
03:34:48.80 --> 03:34:54.16 That price you pay versus the price that you don't pay. That's a big deal. I then think I maximize
03:34:54.16 --> 03:35:01.76 the how should I say the communication of that big deal. Check. I think I have no. Okay. Also at originmain.com
03:35:01.76 --> 03:35:07.04 is American made stuff. Do you get some stuff? Geese, rash cards, some athletic skills.

03:39:39.04 --> 03:39:43.60 cool stuff to hang on your wall. That's all you need to say. Check that out. Flipside
03:39:43.60 --> 03:39:48.000 Canvas dot com. Got a bunch of books. We talked about one of them today. We talked about a couple of
03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:55.60 them today. But about face by Colonel David Hackworth. He highly recommended. There's a new version
03:39:55.60 --> 03:40:02.88 that has a forward in it written by me. I'm now freaking stoked. I was to do that, man.
03:40:04.08 --> 03:40:08.72 Did I tell you that? How that happened? No. They were. So, it started selling again kind of like
03:40:08.72 --> 03:40:12.88 when I started talking about it all the time. And so they eventually pulled the thread and tried
03:40:12.88 --> 03:40:16.56 to figure out why it was selling. And they eventually figured out what was selling because
03:40:17.20 --> 03:40:23.28 we were talking about all the time on the podcast. And they wrote me and said, hey, do you want to
03:40:23.28 --> 03:40:27.60 write? We're going to re-release it. Do you want to write a blur for the back, which is like a little
03:40:27.60 --> 03:40:32.48 quote? Like, hey, this is a great book. And I wrote them and said, uh, I'll write, can I write a
03:40:32.48 --> 03:40:36.96 forward to it? And they'd be like, you want to write a forward? I said, hell, yeah, I'll write a forward to it.
03:40:36.96 --> 03:40:42.40 Most forwards are about 500 words. If you Google, like, how long should a book for it be?
03:40:42.40 --> 03:40:48.32 It should be about 500 words. My forward for this is $5,000. Yeah, it's like a
03:40:48.32 --> 03:40:54.16 really good. Because I just went off and explained how I found it when it meant, you know, all these
03:40:54.16 --> 03:41:00.32 lessons I learned from it. And so yeah, it's been, it's been awesome. So if you want to check out
03:41:00.32 --> 03:41:05.20 that book about face by Colonel David Hackworth, then go ahead and check that out. Also leadership
03:41:05.20 --> 03:41:12.80 strategy and tactics field manual. So good. You, what, you just had a company that told you
03:41:12.80 --> 03:41:18.72 what they just said. Yeah, well, so they'd already, they read extreme ownership in their
03:41:18.72 --> 03:41:22.16 leadership team as them. They have the decademy leadership. And I was like, hey, do you guys have
03:41:22.16 --> 03:41:27.12 leadership strategies and tactics? And they want to have them purchased it. They're like, yeah,
03:41:27.12 --> 03:41:30.88 they're inbound. You got them for the whole thing. And the beautiful thing with it is,
03:41:31.44 --> 03:41:36.16 you got an issue. You can find it in that book with a good solution. It might not be a
03:41:36.16 --> 03:41:42.24 100% solution for your situation, but you can take that formulated and utilize it. That's the
03:41:42.24 --> 03:41:47.68 beauty of that thing. Yeah, that's so powerful. That's exactly what I had in mind when I wrote it.
03:41:47.68 --> 03:41:52.96 Was can you look up in here? Yeah. Okay. Let me go. I'm having a problem with my subordinate.
03:41:52.96 --> 03:41:57.12 What, how do I do? What do I do? You know, I'm having a problem with people getting on board
03:41:57.12 --> 03:42:01.12 with a new plan. What do I do? And just be able to look it up in there, find the solution.
03:42:01.12 --> 03:42:05.92 The, the beautiful thing about it is you don't even have to tab it because the answers are
03:42:05.92 --> 03:42:10.80 up front. Hey, you're having this issue flipped to this page. And in a, in a, in a, one to two pages,
03:42:10.80 --> 03:42:15.52 you find your answer. You read through it, digest it, boom, implement it. So easy. Check.
03:42:18.88 --> 03:42:25.04 The code, the evaluations, the protocol, few needs some guidance on where to go. Look in the
03:42:25.04 --> 03:42:28.96 military, we got told, hey, you're slacking a little here. You could do a little better here. But we
03:42:28.96 --> 03:42:34.16 go through life without an evaluation of ourselves. How you expect to know where to go? Get the code,
03:42:34.16 --> 03:42:39.20 the evaluation of protocol. Get the discipline equals freedom, field manual, new version,
03:42:39.20 --> 03:42:46.56 bigger picture of my head. Yes. Therefore, you know, obviously better. Another 35 or 40 pages
03:42:46.56 --> 03:42:55.44 of writing in there. I deal. I'm going to say it. I don't like to throw that out there. But kind of an
03:42:55.44 --> 03:43:00.56 ideal gift book, right? It's not just like, oh, I went to the book store and randomly found this book
03:43:00.56 --> 03:43:05.04 over here called whatever. Oh, it's like, I got something with a little substance. It's a little
03:43:05.04 --> 03:43:11.20 bigger, it's a little heavier. Looks cool. Looks cool. You could put it on a table and just have it be there.
03:43:12.16 --> 03:43:18.64 And if you read it, you're doing even better. Yes, sir. What up? So I got this. You, you gave me a
03:43:18.64 --> 03:43:23.20 sign copy a few years ago. Oh, I'm just trying to see what the difference is. Oh, yeah. Well,
03:43:23.20 --> 03:43:29.60 the difference is there's about 40 extra pages of what I wrote more stuff. Gotcha. More information.
03:43:29.60 --> 03:43:37.04 So there's that. And then also there's a way of the war. Your kid for field manual, which is what
03:43:37.04 --> 03:43:43.04 your kid wants for Christmas. That's what your kid wants for Christmas. Because all these lessons

03:43:52.64 --> 03:43:57.20 life, understanding these things. And you can end up in a much better place. So what do you
