haircut all the time, but he coached a couple, a couple, super high-level archers, but he was also like, he didn't coach very many people, and he was also, you know, very, I don't know, he was very like stone, you know, so you knew if he was there, he was there watching his few athletes, and they like would pay for him to come and stuff like that, but I remember one time I was in a leading group, we got peer grouped, and then the second day, you know, like ranks 1, 2, 3 and 4 together on the target, you know, in the shoot through, and then it kind of came down to the last target, and you know, I needed a 12 or something to make it into the shoot off, you know, into the top 6, and I missed, you know, and I was freaking pissed about, you know, like broke my stabilizer over my knee and freaking hammer tossed my bow through the woods type thing, and, you know, ended up coming back, like with my bow, just kind of seeing the damage I did, and he came over to me, his name was Tim Strickland, and he said, you know, you could be an amazing archer, but he said, until you start not letting the arrow that you shoot affect the ones that are still in your quiver, you never will, and he said, he goes, do you know a way to get an arrow back once it's left your bow, and I said, what do you mean he goes, do you know a way to get it back other than to physically go down there and pull it out of the target like you just did, and I said no sir, and he said, well, once it's gone, it's gone, and he said, so if you make one mistake, don't make the same mistake for every arrow that's left in your quiver, you know, make one, pull it, you know, pull that arrow out, throw it away, whatever you want, but there's other arrows in the quiver that are capable of doing what you want them to do, and so there's been tournaments where I've, you know, I've actually talked, you know, where I will freaking make a bad shot, and then just look down on my quiver and be like, do any of you sons of bitches want to go in the tenoring because that guy didn't, and you know, and it was just like a totally different approach and mentally, it honestly helped me, this was a, it's kind of a weird thing to say, but, you know, he told me said, you won't figure out how to win until you learn how to lose, and that was, you know, I was like the rage of losing was overpowering my ability to perform at my best because I was letting, you know, I was letting those things happen, and then I remember kind of wanting to get into that a little more, and I read some kind of a sports psychology book, you know, I don't know what it was called, but it said something in there that this sports psychologist had talked to like, he worked with a lot of high-level pictures, and he told him that part of their success was that they had to be able to accept that there was going to be an empire that would, they needed to expect two to three bad calls by the empire, every game, and when they got a call that they didn't think was right, they could just check it off the list of okay, well, there was one of them, and so I started doing that too, and started saying, okay, when I go to an international event because there are certainly our judges that call them really, really tight, you know, and they're all looking at them with the magnifying glass, but they're some like when you'll say like judge, and then, you know, some dude comes over that isn't a tour, like if that, you know, when they do the random thing of like judge, so and so go pull it, and then you see him, you're like, it's out. So, you know, if I focus on just execution, and so once I kind of came to that realization of no one can beat me if I'm executing, if I make a good shot right here, I don't need to see where it lands, because if my site tapes right, and I trust the equipment that I've got, I know it's in the middle, like I know that, but I have to execute here, and so it really got to the point where I like, I took away my spotting scope to where I wasn't getting in the habit of shooting an arrow looking for the result, shooting an arrow looking in a result, which is something that even today, when I work with parents, I tell them that there's, there's like parents that at an archery tournament, they sit like front row with a spotting scope, so the kid will shoot, and then they'll be like 10 at 11 o'clock, and then, you know, the kid will shoot and just turn around to like dad to get confirmation of like how that was, and so part of the things when you have that type of parent is telling them like, listen, this kid, like they need to execute, them looking for you at you for, you know, the result, all the time, it just athletes start to lean on their coach so much, and that was actually one of the problems with some of the people that had that coach that I talked about. I mean, while like the wives and kids are just like not giving a crap about what's going on, but then you just turn in your score card and, you know, this, but once you get into like the professional events, there's two people that keep score, the majority of the group has to agree on the arrow call, and then if there's ever a divide, then you call an official scorekeeper to come and call it, which is kind of a big reason why I liked progressing, because once I was shooting like internationally, you know, they had like, you couldn't even have an arrow judge that was from your country, so if you, you know, it's like if an American needed an arrow call, someone would come over like an official judge from another country would come over because obviously now there's teams competing against teams, so, you know, these judges had schooling on how to call an arrow and stuff like that. Yeah, like, you know, had to, like sat around after tournaments and would like take down courses for places if they'd give me a target, so I'd have another target, you know, or, you know, I would freaking cut grass or clean the bottoms of people's boats, or whatever, so I could buy another target, and then, you know, I had to have an entire range to practice on, and then it just, you know, and then I wanted like a colored target bow, and then it just, it's just like, it's me, it's just me, it's who I am all the time, it just, you know, I had to like, I had to get good at it, but then there came a point where, um, and actually at that tournament was kind of a turning point because this is the cheater one. They only did really well when he could be there with them, because, you know, he'd be like, all right, hey, you miss that one, if those guys, you know, you're good, you're the free, you know, and they had to have that, that continual like affirmation, whereas honestly, for my life, I feel like most of it, I was alone, you know, in regards to like, I like training alone, you know, honestly, I like archery too, because it's a singular sport, so if I train and if I prep, then I'm ready, and it's in my hands, same with hunting, you know, same way with hunting. So I feel like, because I've had to train that way, and even even when I lift, you know, I love lifting by myself versus like going to somewhere where people distract me, I just feel like, you know, I've, I know that if I put in the work, then at that point, it's, it's really on me, not on someone else, and like, when I told you, we sucked it football, you know, there was a couple people like, you know, like Jason, who knew their role and knew their position, and other people's position, and they would cover for people that maybe didn't do something right, but there's also three cores of the team that didn't. And, you know, even though it was a raffle, you know, people still well, you know, not everyone's got 20 bucks to buy a bunch of raffle tickets and it's like, you know, you can't make everyone happy, but the reality is, you know, if someone really wants to go through and put it all together, they can, you know, they can read all these and, you know, so many different things that I've heard you talk to people, you know, and give them, I don't know, you people will come and be like, hey, you know, Jock, go give me some advice about this. So, you know, I think we made a lot of really good choices by weighing out, like, long-term relationships that understood the direction we needed to go, but we weren't there yet, but they were going to help at a rate that they could to where we could get to our goal versus, like, you know, a lot of startups or the perfect example of, like, you know, they make a lot of dumb decisions as I did as a business, you know, given stuff away to the wrong people, and those, those places come and go all the time, and I think as like an and, you know, an ambassador type figure, whatever, you can, I think you can be like the call me influencers. So then I went to the National Triple Crown and slept in the back of my truck and, you know, shot at that and sucked at it horribly, but then the next year, you know, I instead of going like two, I went to all of them, drove to all of them, and just got better and got better, and then within like five years, I was at a level that was, you know, that I was happy with, but I was also still refining it, you know, just there's, that's what's cool about archery is, I think the reason I'm still doing it is because, you know, I still find, if I'm not centered, then it shows, so it's hard, like, you're never going to have a perfect game to where you can just back away and know that like, okay, that was a Cinderella story I've done, because you can go have a perfect round, but then in an hour later, I've seen you have to shoot another one, I just, I don't know, it's just what I was into, like I was a skater and honestly, there was, I enjoy skating, I enjoyed like freaking ninja movies and so I, like, I built ramps and you know, and people and I was just like a punk and Northern Illinois, that, you know, when, when everything was like skater died and there was, you know, all these, like anti-scape things, that was me. But even if they don't listen right there, by the next time they talked to you, they've a hundred percent, you know, went crazy about trying to apply that, you know, the work ethic is very, it's like the perfect formula for a coach, you know, is all those guys and every, every one of them that I've introduced it to so far has needed, has really needed archery as, I don't know, like, like you said, it's like a quiet, it's like a quiet form of what you used to do, you know. So, you know, I just eventually, I did what I needed to do in competitive archery to like help me build a platform to where I really wanted to go, which is I've always liked to coach, you know, and, and I've always liked really good coaches, you know, I've liked, I'm the type of person where I liked coaches that like, honestly that like yelled at me and were like, Paris had coaches, we're, you know, Sharon said, that guy just sat there and like, I kind of think I would love that guy. You know, I remember like one of the saying, my football coach always would have, he'd be like, you know, bring the boat in, you know, he always would say like the boats lost, he's like a geor job to bring the boat in, you know, and he was like, you're job-meaning you, They're doing a couple of team things there, and so he had asked me if I wanted to go down just to to teach some navigation of like, instead of learning the long distance aspect to like make some competitions on the closest shot to where they, you know, to where I would assess their choice of that navigation and like what they could do different to where it's like, okay, we know how far you can shoot something from now, you know, who can jack something at a guard or whatever, you know. So there's no one watching, because just you just can't you're like on a path through like through this course, to where it's not like golf, like professional golf, there'd be like a crowd following like those leaders through that course, which in professional archery like that happens. But yeah, learning that, you know, learning how to lose, because I've lost way more than I've won, and that's a fact, you know, you have to figure out a way to win in life, you know, you do have to figure out a way to win, but if you deal with like being a hyper-competitive, then you also have to learn how to lose, otherwise you freaking derail yourself, way more than others can derail you, and I'm convinced that I beat myself way more than other people beat me and most of the things that I've lost at, you know, it's like, which is why now my coachings involved so much, because now my coaching is so focused on, you know, what you execute within your box, because I kind of got to the point where I recognized if I make a good shot, it's a 10, that's the highest score on the paper. I mean, they're freaking cute up, you know, because I remember, uh, Andy and I were on something where it was, it was, it was a pretty tough, like, yeah, it was kind of a little bit of a miracle that we pulled off this stock and jack something I don't know what it was, but I remember saying, like, you know, doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to kill a person, he's just like, dude, because it is not this hard at all. I was more, you know, I come up with things to talk about based on someone I'm working with at that time, but yeah, the brand became a community, you know, it became, you know, Sharon always said like, we're not, you know, we don't have fans, we have, you know, we have a community like we have, you know, we have a knock on nation. And honestly, my mom's like, you know, she was so, you know, involved with her position at backster to where she's like, yeah, if you want to, you know, go somewhere for a month in the summer, do it, you know, because I think she probably just, you know, was managing plants and Puerto Rico or Singapore or wherever the heck, you know, she was for her job. If they don't know like stroke and like how to block and breathe and you're like taking on water in your mouth and you're like trying to blow that out and yeah, you know, you're freaking sprinting when there's waves up like and we were on that hillside, glass and you just said, bro, this freaking, this is a recon right now, like, you know, I'd have a team right over there, there'd be freaking two dudes right there, they'd be like, you know, back up and then we'd be here and like, you know, the shit would be all pulled over tight, you know, you were in your element just dorking out. Yeah, it is 100% I think it's an awesome and awesome sport, especially for people that come from your background who are looking for a new mission, you know, you set it perfectly because with all of you guys who have done it, you know, learning a new discipline or a new trade is one thing but then once it comes to like packing up to freaking go on call, that lights a whole different intensity where, you know, hey, we're meeting, you know, we're out at dark, back at dark and when you're out there, you know, geared up and freaking ready to get after it, you know, I remember the first time you and they acted like, you know, he just told them something this never been said and it's like, actually, if they would follow that, like, you know, I'm a broken record when it comes to archery, I've, I've boiled down a recipe to, you know, what I feel is like a balsamic glaze. It was like and rode down and I'm just like, now you tell me dude, I freaking was taken like full endos, just freaking one after another in the freaking mortar zone, just taking heavy artillery, Josh going Josh or just out there like, watch me just like, you know, he'll be back, he'll be back out here 15 or whatever. So what I feel bad about is, though, is I know that some people are doing like they're like, oh, cool, like I want to support because we're like, you like, hey, man, if you want to support what's going on here, then you get some get some gear. You like really like when you're at a local tournament or a weather, it's freaking bowling, you know, like over the line, you know, markets zero, they're just having an argument, you know, it's like you can cheat. But yeah, like, I think about, you know, because like, all my dads, you know, all my dad's military stuff, like, every picture he had from, you know, as a child, you know, everything we had, every single thing. So it went from like me being like the short fat skater to now I'm, you know, second tallest kid in the school and growing and, you know, becoming an asshole, you know, just kind of being, you're just growing up just being like overly confident, you know. So I just went like full sprint for like the first 30 seconds and then Josh, like, as I'm like kind of starting to burn out, you know, that freaking Josh is like strokes by and there just go and then Jocca was just looking back. If I, you know, I've had hunts where I've had a lot of distractions, and I threw my stuff in a case that, you know, the day before and went and, you know, missed a couple shots and was just like, in rage, but then I also thought like, yeah, dude, you didn't prep, you didn't know homework, you know, that's what happens. and it's like this weird like mock-up of the design on this real like real like like, what do you see in these, like, model? Or, you know, you know, there's just ore I can try a different species or a different, you know, climate or a different time of year, and it's a whole new challenge, like it's a clean slate, and then you're, you know, trying to formulate a plan and map out a plan of how do I, you know, how do I, like, win this challenge? So I just like stretched out and just looked like this gumby going up and down the basketball court, you know, my dad's like, I always felt like if you tripped it sound like a chandelier break and a crossing. It'd be like, you know, it'd be just like walking up and even if a big dude, you said like, you know, hey, do a clean and jerk and you just like put 200 pounds on there. You know, I didn't, like, if I would have just, like, taken that blanket and like, you know, if he would have just said, go throw that blanket out in the yard, like, game over. So they said, you know, if you feel like you want to create a bow that's specific to, you know, to your followers or if you want to do something and I said, well, you know, can I bring in a bow that's like at a budget price, you know, and they just said, And they use like super, when I say substandard material, it's like, you know, it's like the internet shirt that you print, you know, it's like that, then they get that. So, that kind of gave us the platform to create a name for ourselves and then obviously, you know, we've just continually built we meaning I've only ever done the content, the brand was always sharing, you know, the brand and, you know, knock on archery.com has always been sharing, where is, you know, I really don't like that side of things, I just really want to like, I want to teach people from my experience of whatever's happening at the moment. It's kind of like, I think there's like $100 increments like you can get a bow for 400 bucks, but you're going to be limited, you know, and then I think once you get to like $699, $799 for the bow only, you're in a really good position and then put good accessories on it What does it, what does it, end of it may it looks, it reminds me of looks like, you know, the old school, like, you know, if you have archery class at school, you know, the thing, like it's, it's not sharp, but it's made to stick into something. You know, they'd never seen me even at a local club, you know, because I was just nothing, and then when as I always do, you know, oh, I'm not good at this, then just like headfirst into the deep in like, how many shoot narrows at night, waking up in the morning, shoot narrows, like, you just fall on, fall on the session immediately. I just always made sure that they used my photo content so that, you know, I was able to give exposure to the brands that I represented and so, you know, it's just kind of like the perfect storm of having enough support to where I could grow into where I wanted to be and then, you know, then eventually like knock on knock on's like evolved. And then, you know, there's a ton of people now that are just for a better food source alternative, they're open-minded to hunting if it's, you know, in their minds fair chase, which, you know, bow hunting, you know, kind of lowers that boundary for people to where they're like, okay, if I'm going to put in all this work and do it, I'm totally cool, you know, eating this thing or killing it or whatever. I know I did some stuff with like, you know, I remember wearing like pants, jersey helmet, you know, just doing like dry runs and stuff. And so he kept telling me, like, you need to go, just go do something, you know, just, you know, go get active, hang out with your friends, like, you know, he wasn't want me to like sit around and get depressed about it. I feel like those are the little things in business, you know, especially now, like so many people build business based off social media or, you know, maybe they've, you know, maybe they've been with the origin for, you know, using your guise for a year. and I had already done DVDs that were like, you know, kind of out of the, the trunk of your car DVDs that I thought were a little bit of head of their time because I always said that like I wanted our hunting show to be like hunting, kind of crashed with MTV cribs, crashed with like Robin Big. It's like when you buy a metallic a t-shirt like from some dude on the beach, yeah, it looks like there's like plastic stickers like yeah, Like, and that's what, it had to be because, you know, we've worked really hard, Sharon and I, to, you know, really stay on our path at knock on our tree because there's, there's been a lot of opportunities to, you know, maybe, I don't know if sell out would be like the term because it probably wouldn't be that drastic, but we could have definitely made a lot more decisions that would have put our following secondary to decisions that we made and the PSE collaboration was a, was an awesome plug-in play for us. I'd just know where to go and then you go to these courses and it would be like, well, a lot like, you know, we shot big sky together, you know, for the total archery challenge and we've shot the same course because it ends in a good place, you know. So, one time it was, you know, South Africa, another time it was like Germany, another time it was Australia but it came around to Canada and so I went up and talked to a lot of shops up there and said, you know, hey, what do you guys think about doing like a seminar tour like what was working for me and other demographics? And then, but like, I've, I've done that, like, when I was in, when I was in the, when I was in the seal teams and I was teaching, like, I would be, you know, I'd have some guy that I could be like, hey, man, if I freak out in this guy, he's going to freak out. Where a jiu-jitsu tournament, like when you have like, I've victory, I have an in-house jiu-jitsu tournament, there's no like escalating the call that the point keep, you know, your tech, hey man, you lost whatever you did good, someone could be like, It's like, no, it's just like, it's just the understanding of like the technique of like where you're pushing and pulling and like the leverage of it. And he's like, you know, we need to make a man of you because I'm showing up with freaking Tony Hawk haircut and freaking earrings and, you know, stuff like stuff like that. So after I, you know, slung some kettlebells around for a while, I, you know, went and grabbed some bands and just did some like burnouts of, you know, shoulders and, you know, freaking arms and stuff, which I thought was, you know, I worked out for an hour. Because if someone just really started focusing on, you know, teaching surfing to people like me, you know, and I came in, they like start this whole other thing to where these people all over here are probably looking at like, what's this guy even doing? And then yeah, one of the hard things for me, one of the hardest things is, you know, I'm a very loyal person, you know, and I've since I've also been, I've worked internally at manufacturers, I look at, you know, ambassadors or external representatives in a different light than, you know, if someone just outbearing an ambassador, you know, or public figure, whatever, whatever, you know, it's way different now. So by like 2003, I just felt like I would land know how to get to the shoot without even like, wouldn't even need to like look at a map. And I'd just throw, you know, from corner to the gym to corner the gym, I'd just run like three step drills and just like run 73 passes into those or then into garbage cans or then eventually just like throwing into the basketball hoop and then just doing like three step drops, five step drops, seven step drops, roll outs and And you know, it's such a different side than, you know, kind of like at the beginning of the thing when you're reading your socials and awesome at that, like you're the perfect person to like do voice over work. I'm like, hopefully keep score for these other guys that have a problem, you know, because it's called like pencil pushing, you know, and they just said, well, if you don't want to deal with that, you could always go to Nationals where there's two score keepers, and so I'm just like, where's that? So like I'm hearing him tell it how it is and you know, and even like the terminology like he was a good man, that was classic, you know, that was classic pop up right there. He's like, he goes, all of us would be, he's like, you know, he's like, a lot of us would be, you know, at a totally different level if we had to learn this way first. And I liked the idea of like getting, honestly, I never really felt like that town was home, you know, and maybe it's because, like, you know, my parents were kind of always split. You've talked about, you know, like, you know, for extreme ownership, right, when you first started doing it, and you would, you know, probably when you started, you would get cash by going in places and doing that presentation, which is kind of like when I used to travel Europe. It's like, they're good stuff, you know, and I know like what can make most archers who are brand new be at a very high level fast and eliminate a lot of mistakes, but, you know, whether you watch every video I have or read all those articles or you come in person. I think what might be confusing you, I go is like the first tournament that he's talking about are just like kind of like local, just going to be like, just going to be a festival. There's just a whole new archery pie, like, you know, people within the archery community, that pie would be like, you know, local surfers around here probably, you know, that's probably a pie. You know, it's like once I started to compete, I hadn't ever been taught the management of like, you know, raging out when you, like made a bad play or through an interception or something. Like, for, bro, I was going into like, I was, I was saying this kind of stuff like, bro, you got to give me like two minutes of hard pattern. But for me, I had gone through two consecutive contracts that were multi-year contracts and both of them kind of got cut when our business is projecting, you know, in this format, but then, you know, they're like, well, you know, we're kind of plateauing from a marketing point of view and, you know, we're not getting added budgets, but we need to make room for other things.
