00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jockel podcast number 251 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening. And also joining us tonight. This is my brother, Dave Baben.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
From podcast 11, first guest ever on the podcast 34 65 14 and 138.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And obviously, Dave was in task unit, bruiser as the Charlie Platoon commander in the Battle of

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the body. We wrote extreme ownership. We wrote that I caught a major leadership together.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we have a leadership consultancy called Escelon Front.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I at one point in my life gave him the book that I've been reviewing for the last couple episodes that I wrote, the new forward to the book is called about face.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we're going to talk a little bit about that, but then we're going somewhere else.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Dave, thanks for coming back all man. Thanks for having me on with 2018.

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
14 August 2018. The world has changed drastically since then. That's kind of crazy.

11
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's crazy that as much as I see you, we just didn't coordinate for another podcast in over two years.

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's apparently, did you say everything you had to say on the first five? Apparently so. That's just the way it is.

13
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You were telling me about about face in the Battle of Ramadi.

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Me kind of saying, hey, check this out. Check out this section.

15
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What were you thinking about reading you about like the South Vietnamese Army and how corrupt they were,

16
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
or whatever, all these different examples?

17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I mean, just I thought it was so awesome that this new, you know, this new book with the new forward grid in my view, you know, for about face, the new, the new version of it that's out with the new forward.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I remember to say they come back from operations in Ramadi, more pull tests, probably at least four or five different times.

19
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I could remember where I like walk into the year office in the Tackle Operations Center at the Cat Margley and you'd say,

20
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Hey, listen to this and I was like, okay, and you bust out the book, you'd open it up to like a highlighted section, read this section.

21
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And it was mind blowing because it was just like, it was written about the operation that I was just on like an hour ago.

22
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And instead it was written 40 years before about Vietnam.

23
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And it was pretty, pretty early. And I was, it had, I never realized all the influences until later when you gave me a copy of the book,

24
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which is the one thing that you gave to me and you gave the SESNON, the Delta Tick Commander, when we finished task in a loser, we came home.

25
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I still have that book, it's dated, you know, January, 2007, we just been home for two months at that point.

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But now going through that book, I realized like, where you got the, you know, renaming task in a loser.

27
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You know, all those things like there's so many things that came from that. So it had so much influence on you and through you on me and everybody in task in a loser.

28
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And then every generation after it, that's crazy.

29
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, in that book, in the book about face, there's two quotes that always bothered me.

30
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Here's the first one.

31
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Men in battle, men will do in battle what they have been in the habit of doing in training.

32
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
General Bruce Clark, one of the US Army's greatest training generals had written in his then recently published guidelines for the leader and commander.

33
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So that's the first quote that bothered me. The second quote that bothered me was this quote.

34
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The troops responded well to hard hands on repetitive but still interesting work.

35
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
They may not have wanted to go to Vietnam, but they sure as hell didn't want to die there. So they even flocked to off duty classes like Rekondo.

36
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Meanwhile, I established the requirement that all officers and NCOs in the battalion read and carry on their person.

37
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000
General Bruce Clark's guidelines for the leader and commander as far as I was concerned the finest little handbook on leadership and training ever written.

38
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And it dropped as their own philosophy, the one that I'd learned from a five by seven card, which I still had issued to me in Clark's seventh army in Germany, which stated an organization does well only those things the boss checks and quote.

39
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So why did those two quotes bothered me? They didn't bother me because I didn't agree with them. Obviously, they bothered me because I could never find this specific book called guidelines for the leader and commander.

40
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And I always searched for it.

41
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I would look for, and you know, these days you can pretty much find anything online, especially like a lot of the old manuals that I read.

42
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Old army manuals on, you know, they've been out of print for a long time, but you can go find a PDF somebody uploaded it. This thing has been nowhere forever.

43
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And here I was learning from this book that Colonel Hacworth wrote, but I could never find the book that Hacworth learned from.

44
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And that did not make me happy. So so who was this guy? General Bruce Clark Bruce Clark.

45
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
He's a world war world war 2 career. He enlisted in 1917 and it up going to West Point. Hope you don't hold that against some life.

46
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Get to go. I turned down my poem at the West Point, but it's a great place. He's got into a army school. Look at you over a cheever.

47
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I had to go to the seal, let's see it around man. There's a goal.

48
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You, that's a rough gamble, right? It was a rough gamble and it paid. It was very poor gamble. I graduated and I didn't get selected with a seal program.

49
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I could tell you, I was like, I should have gone to West Point. I'd be in the army.

50
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You know, I'd have all those opportunities in front of me.

51
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That is the, that is the worst luck that that happens that the seal teams is in the Navy.

52
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And if you don't, if you want to be a seal and you don't make it into the seal teams, you're in the Navy because you probably don't want to have the type of job that a regular Navy dude has.

53
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
If you want to be in the seal teams, would you concur?

54
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Definitely. I mean, if you, if you want to be in the seal teams, that means you want to be shooting machine gun and run around in the streets or the jungle or whatever.

55
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You don't want to be on a ship. You don't work in an engine room or, or, you know, driving a ship or,

56
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
driving a ship or a bridge or whatever. And those are cool jobs too, different people like different jobs, but those are two almost totally different types of jobs.

57
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Whereas, hey, if you tried for special forces and you didn't make it, you still be an infantry guy and that's still the similar thing.

58
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But you just rolled the dice big time.

59
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I did, but it worked out. And, you know, you got to trust it.

60
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In fact, I got selected for the seal program right out of the academy in 1998, when I graduated. I'd have never been a task in Bruser.

61
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I would have not been Charlie between commander. I would have done my OIC, probably at least a year or two or three prior to that as a lot of the guys who were my same year group.

62
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So, you know, that's the good Lord has a plan and you got to just trust in that plan and, and I actually not had I got selected from Marine Corps.

63
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I was never had a chance to be in the seal teams either. So, but last points in awesome school man, it was a really, really agonizing decision for me because I got picked up for last point in, and like, it was like probably January,

64
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000
February of my senior year and then I found out I got, I got an appointment. So I accepted it and then I didn't find out until like April that I got into the Navy.

65
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So it was, you know, it was, it was a big gamble for sure, but hey man,

66
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000
it's an awesome, obviously there's a great rivalry between West Point and you know, Army Navy, everyone knows the football games, but I am one of the things we're most proud of, obviously,

67
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the Intascan Ruser was being the one-one AD Army Seals as they call this and so good on General Cart.

68
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
One thing that I just wanted to say when you read that quote, I'm fascinated, you know, to listen this as well because I have used that quote,

69
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
an organization does well only those things the boss checks, I probably a thousand times.

70
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Since teaching the Junior Officer Training course up through what we do now with our strong front and I did not realize it came out of this book.

71
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I was going to say don't you use the attributed to that? I was a trivety-taque.

72
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yeah, I think I just missed remember that he, he obviously was giving credit to General Clark and I clearly did not remember that.

73
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I did not do that right. Yeah, so he went to West Point, so he enlisted World War I went to West Point, World War II,

74
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
commanded the fourth armored division in patents, patents third Army,

75
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Battle of Arakort, Battle of the Bulge, Distinguished Service Cross and three Silver Stars, also in Korea, ended up with 45 or so years of service.

76
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Not only leading troops, but also he oversaw a bunch of training schools and training commands,

77
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
died in 1988 at age 86 and I wanted this book, I searched for this book for years, I wrote an email to the publisher.

78
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This publisher still exists, I'm going to call them out right now because I'm sure someone will reach out to them.

79
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I think it's stacked poll books, they still exist and we've covered other books of theirs on this podcast because they print a lot of military type books.

80
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think the clay pigeons is St. Low, we covered that on this podcast and a few others that are in the queue.

81
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I reached out to them and said, I'm email, hey, I'm looking for this book, I see that you used to publish it.

82
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Nothing never heard, nothing back.

83
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And then, you know, like you said, the Lord works in mysterious ways about face the new, the new version comes out.

84
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I searched on Amazon once a month, I'll search and see if they would have this book.

85
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I've listed in there, that's why I knew the publisher was, but they would have it in there and not available, not available for years, it's been not available.

86
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It popped up. It says available one copy, $300, $300, this is, and I'm only holding a photo copy right now.

87
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It was $300, this thing is 117 pages, it's like, I don't know, six by a little, it's small.

88
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It's this little book, it showed up in a little tiny envelope, I was super stoked.

89
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And as you might imagine, like you said, it's filled with lessons filled with the obvious roots of hackers theories around training and leadership, which I stole as you already.

90
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Rightfully accused me of stealing many things from hack worth as I fully admit all the time that I stole, I used to pass on to everyone I could still try and pass on.

91
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Still trying pass on to about face, still trying to pass on what we do in echelon front, trying pass on these lessons.

92
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So you know what, I don't think you can actually use the word steel because they're freely given in the same way that like, when people are like, hey, do you mind if we like talk about it's remodership with our team like, no.

93
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I actually don't mind, in fact, that's what we wrote the book for, that's why hack, I'm sure that's why hack wrote the about face and I'm sure, obviously that's why general Clark wrote what he wrote.

94
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So it's not stealing, it's freely given and I think as we often said, like, we didn't learn anything new, we just, we just maybe package it a little bit differently.

95
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah, I use a different term than maybe other's used.

96
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's always good when it's pretty common for, you know, me to do a, an initial client call with a company and they'll be, you know, give me a brief on their company and they're like, our company values are blah, blah, blah, blah,

97
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
extreem ownership and they're like, hey, we hope you don't mind, we're like, exact same thing.

98
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I say, you can't steal, what's free? So, uh, and I, I try and give hack worth credit. Yeah, but I guess you're right, can't steal, what's free, but what we can do is we can take it and we can try and pass it on.

99
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So without further ado, I present to you at long last guidelines for the leader and commander.

100
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.000
There's, I'll have to show it to you later. There's a little, there's a little signature. I don't have it in the photo copy. There's a, it's written, there's a little, you know, somebody gave it to someone, something gave it to like the command sergeant major or something like that.

101
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
All right. So here we go dedicated to the ground combat soldier.

102
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Paramount concern of the army is the ground combat soldier. He is the focal point of all our efforts organizing equipping training, sustaining and supporting him so that he can perform his indispensable role in combat is the army role.

103
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
The role is equally significant in any kind of war hot or cold.

104
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It is just as important in general war as it is in limited war for our nation to entertain any notion to the contrary would be dangerous.

105
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The danger could be social as well as military more than any other category of personnel in the armed forces, the ground combat soldier comes from the general populace. He is the private citizen under arms the clenched fist of his people.

106
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I think I'm just rolling that from now on. That is the greatest description of a combat. Yes.

107
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm a combat soldier I've ever heard of my life. The clenched fist of the people. Why? Why is this the first time I'm hearing this? That's the one thing I'm, I'm just remiss about.

108
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Me too. We could have, we could have put that up as like a post to a potassium abuser.

109
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You know, I think I used and you may have heard me use this in fact, I know you did. The sort of destruction.

110
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I used that to describe sort of what our methodology was, especially in cleaning out insurgency and how, hey everyone wants to be. Everyone wants to make friends and when the hearts and minds and that's all definitely important.

111
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But that really comes and this is, this is what I use this line that would come after the sort of destruction has been wielded on the insurgents or the bad guys.

112
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I think the fist of the people is better. We're going with a clenched fist, the clenched fist of the people.

113
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Back to the book, it is by no idle chance in the history of mankind that the course of democracy parallels the importance according to the ground combat soldier in the military forces of nations.

114
00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It is no exaggeration to say that the basic freedoms we now enjoy are closely related to his ascending importance on the battlefields since the battle of crazy.

115
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Nor is it an exaggeration, in my opinion, to say that the preservation of those freedoms will continue to be oriented by his place in the sun.

116
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Only when men from all of the people are willing and ready to fight and die for freedom does freedom have meaning for them.

117
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Only then does democracy thrive.

118
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Is the inexorable lesson of history. These are important things to be reading right around this time in the world, because what percentage of the populace actually is in the military one percent.

119
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So there's not a lot of people that seem to step up and be ready and willing and what does that mean? That means they don't understand what the price is.

120
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And the cost is what he's saying here is freedom is only safe when there's people that are when there's all people he's saying all people by the way, all people have to be ready and willing.

121
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
To be.

122
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Well, you also have to think about his perspective though, right? I mean, I think in America today obviously we've been at war for a long time since 9.11.

123
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But there really there isn't an existential threat in the way that he was living with World War I. You've got this expanding empire now World War II.

124
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You've got you've got the Japanese Germans. I mean there's the world was truly at stake and and it was everybody all hands on deck even those that couldn't serve who are medically qualified or whatever.

125
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Like they're they're they're doing everything for blood drives to you know collecting tires all that kind of stuff is going on back here bond drives you know.

126
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
We've got to.

127
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Yeah, you know the rosy the riveter I mean ladies out there turning wrenches and building planes and tanks and all that stuff.

128
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So I think that was I mean our country has an experience that probably since that's World War II, but I think living to that probably gave him unique perspective.

129
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:22.000
This also ties in continuing on but guide by the mechanical marvels of an age it is easy for people to forget the true character of the ground combat soldiers in war.

130
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000
When free men have been so bogiled in the past they have slipped back into slavery.

131
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000
For the ability of the ground combat soldier to play his part in the social scheme of things depends upon the part he has given in the military scheme of things.

132
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Again, we we can very easily think about the fact that you know this war is a technical thing and you don't have to put boots on the ground and that whole idea that technology can eliminate war.

133
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:18.000
But you and I were talking the other day that there's there's some people that hey God bless them they have a positive attitude that we as a species can evolve to a point where you know we don't have more anymore and that's a very positive thought think we would all agree that that would be a great thing.

134
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We are probably highly unrealistic because there's always going to be somebody to put no matter how nice you are there's always going to be somebody that's going to try and.

135
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Take a couple extra dollars from you echo Charles yes you have to defend yourself.

136
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Even if you're super nice.

137
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Yes you might have to fight.

138
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I think you can't study history and believe that we're on some greater trajectory and mankind is above war or conflict or evil or darkness and I think I'll have most about this podcast is.

139
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Reminding people of the darkness you can't appreciate the light if you don't know the darkness and and I think that's that's the most powerful thing and I think only view experience what general clock is experienced do you fully get understand that.

140
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I answer a question on podcast a long time ago guy said you know you keep talking about training jjitsu but I don't even like to fight why should I train jjitsu and I said if you don't like to fight you are actually the premier person that needs to train jjitsu.

141
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And if you don't like war and you don't want to go to war.

142
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Then you should train and prepare and be ready to go to war and then hopefully won't have to.

143
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And if you do it'll be swift.

144
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And that quote reminds me of is that we get asked how often do we get asked about you know talk about some training or bud story you know from the seal basic training program and we don't even talk about that stuff because I think people.

145
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I mean the I'm trying to explain to people that the the the physical nature of combat operations is so much more you know more difficult than anything and training and then then the emotional you know.

146
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So it's going to say that as a physical yes but the mental and emotional isn't even comparable thing right like it's not a comparable thing to say.

147
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Well you know I was really wet and cold during seal training compared to I was waiting to suck start an IED.

148
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:29.000
17 nights in a row you know like that's definitely more mental stress than hey you're going to have to go hit the surfer again who cares.

149
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
No question about that but what I'm talking about the physical nature of it so we're talking about the ground combat so here and this is.

150
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:53.000
You know I'm thinking about you know one of our seals I mean you certainly know well it's one of my most awesome guys in charge of it's in suit just a physical you know stud awesome dude who's like going down with heat exhaustion and like can't can't continue forward and I'm having like.

151
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I've made you're machine gun take my you know my rifle my M4 we got a movement we can't stay here we're going to get we're going to get hammered and we knew we're going to get we're going to get ambushed any second so it was.

152
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I'm going to go to the vehicle nature of that like I can't physically continue because I'm carrying you know 80 pounds of gear on this patrol and it's 117 degrees right now and I got a little behind the hydration curve.

153
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I think that's something that people when you're talking about technology and arriving in vehicles or flying an aircraft or shooting missiles and there's there's just no getting around.

154
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I was carrying a rock sack you know a heavy rock sack would gear and going on foot and out the you remind was unique like that for us because.

155
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I think it's just it's just savage like it's just you know whenever you put on you know like at the beginning of land warfare training and you have put on a rocksack and whatever two months because you were.

156
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I'm going to go on leave and whatever and you get out to the desert warfare training facility and you put your gear on for the first time and you're like yeah and the first it's one of those things were the first like 20 minutes.

157
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:50.000
You're just thinking this completely sucks and then it just sucks about that the suck kind of numbs out but it's just savage it's just it's just it's just a constant level of pain and no no matter how good of shape you thought you were I mean that guy was just talking about was an awesome shape he was a great you know physical specimen like awesome dude train hard all the time well the best deals I know.

158
00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:00.000
I mean it happened to me I remember Johnny Kim was a patron in the position Johnny Kim was like you know here's our corpsman he's like hey life you do an okay.

159
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:29.000
I'm like I don't know man you know he's I was like super pale and he could see that I was and I just I was dehydrated and we're already smoke you've been up for 24 hours so he like gave me an IV and you know to just help me help me recuperates and we were in good shape I mean we train hard we are already a climate does it just it was it was hard it was physically difficult all those emotional things are absolutely okay when it was a it was physically hard.

160
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And probably the best dayberg talks about this you could deal with good deal dayberg.

161
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Running with a pallet of water between where you you were back at cop falcon we were in a cyber Overwatch position like 300 yards down the street.

162
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Carrying on on Israeli stretcher with like pallets of water and MREs which probably you know probably way like 200 pounds and running as fast as we could with that in all our combat gear for 300 yards.

163
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And then we were like hey we're like let's go and we're just running and it was awesome I didn't deliver you run to you guys down there you did you brought some water to this we're just we're just baking on the roof top and nothing.

164
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah, no, no, no, no, like even just that even just sitting there baking on a rooftop for three days just just getting dehydrated everything sucks as to quote Tony everything sucks everything sucks.

165
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:48.000
All right back to the book it will be a sorry day for all mankind in this supersonic nuclear age of ours should the ground combat soldier ever be deprived of his rightful place in the hearts and minds and military forces of his people.

166
00:24:48.000 --> 00:25:01.000
In our efforts to abort this danger a one army attitude must pervade all ranks the ground combat soldier is not a guardsman nor regular nor reservist nor a selectee.

167
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
He is simply the American fighting man on the one army team.

168
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I appeal to every member of the team civilian and military to give his cause the enthusiastic support marited by its vital importance to our country Bruce C Clark general US army.

169
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
There's the intro.

170
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
We're already off to good start.

171
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I'm the next copy that's effort 300 bucks.

172
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I'm sure stack full will will reach out, but if they don't, I'm just going to publish this thing.

173
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Jack O'Poachal publish yes coming in hot with the PDF.

174
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Publishers forward.

175
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:56.000
These guidelines were written by a leader and commander out of the wealth of experience gained by him in leading and commanding troops from a squad to an army group.

176
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000
These guidelines were prepared for the benefit of the of other leaders and commanders in the US army in order that they in turn may make use of his counsel and experience.

177
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
So as you said, he wrote this for us.

178
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:20.000
General Bruce C Clark has probably had more command duty at more command levels than any other officer in the US army living or dead.

179
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:44.000
He served more than 40 years in all grades from private to forestar general known as the most effective trainer of modern times in the US army as well as an outstanding combat commander general Clark here specifies the methods he has used without standing success in management training in soldier management and in leadership and general ship.

180
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
What do you think not exactly the light way not exactly the light way.

181
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
The picture in here says the ground combat soldier the focal point of all our efforts.

182
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
You know what's cool God.

183
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I was just as you're as you're saying that you know I'm sitting there thinking about my experience and body and you know our combat experience three to points or a rack is just absolutely nothing compared to what someone who fought in World War one World War two and Korea.

184
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I mean it's it's just it just I'm so humble when I read about people's experiences and realize oh I if I think I thought I thought I saw some combat and that was significant for the Iraq war is like man it's absolutely nothing all the even the physical hardship something describing just pale in comparison.

185
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:39.000
You know to to battles and just what what general Clark experience it's so many have experienced about the ages we often joke about the fact that.

186
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Just what we experienced compared to what these guys went through when we had Dean lad on the podcast.

187
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Who got got shot.

188
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Rollin into Taroa 500 yards from the beach.

189
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
There's no possible way he should survive that and by the way what was really crazy is that was like he did.

190
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
After he got done with a he had already done.

191
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:15.000
The one of the other islands he goes into Taroa gets got shot two of Marines disobey all orders and actually grab him and bring him back to a boat he gets somehow miraculously safe he goes back.

192
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:23.000
To Hawaii and then six months later he's back going on another island campaign it's like oh you got got shot but you survived school you're in the game.

193
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Yeah.

194
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
America what.

195
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
All right chapter one.

196
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Part one is leadership and command chapter one command responsibilities introduction when an individual assumes command of a unit larger small he steps into one of the most interesting and the most challenging assignments a member of the armed forces can have.

197
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Here is a job into which a man can sink his teeth.

198
00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Here is a job where initiative originality hard work fidelity and human understanding can pay off in the richest dividends this chapter includes many matters that are connected with the ability of the commander to train his unit.

199
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So it's interesting what extreme ownership we close out by saying this is the most challenging endeavor human can.

200
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Leadership is the most challenging endeavor human faces and therefore the most rewarding.

201
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And so where we didn't steal that from him even though he just said the exact same thing even though he wrote it a lot earlier than us.

202
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000
You know what you know what it is though like it was when we talk which I believe it's all the time and they say hey we're already doing a lot of things you're talking about.

203
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And and what the reason for that is because there's what works and there's what doesn't work so no matter what you call it you know we gave a little framework around

204
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And so if you're in a leadership position you're going to you're going to figure out what actually works and that makes me think about this you talk about psychology a lot and not not in like.

205
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Psychological terms and you know like clinical terms but in like.

206
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And I try to get people do what you need them to do to accomplish a mission with and that's exactly a human nature it took me out of the home of the podcast must have been around I don't know but at some point I said yeah this is a podcast about human nature really that's what it's about human nature and where human nature is most revealed is in war or in.

207
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:33.000
atrocities or human suffering or human struggle that's when that's when human nature is revealed and you know.

208
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:48.000
We had this conversation and I don't know when but I remember telling you and stoner and being like hey look when we go on deployment people are going to go crazy and look I didn't mean hey these people are going up but we don't when you talk about senior leaders or.

209
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I'm going to start feeling pressure and people do crazy things and I saw that from my first deployment to Iraq Ross I was thinking wait a second this is just like people are going crazy so.

210
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000
That's something that happens it's it's just human nature is revealed and if you're.

211
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Let's say you're nervous about things let's say you're nervous type person you're you're you're a scared of something. What's that going to do in combat it's just going to get worse let's say you're worried about things.

212
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
What's going to happen to combat you're going to be even more worried let's say you have a tendency to focus on things that don't really matter.

213
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
You're going to do that even more in combat it's like everything you're just your human nature gets exposed.

214
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
To quote you it's combat is life amplified and it's a bunch of and I think that's that's.

215
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
That's a hundred percent true it's a hundred percent true and it's like that friend that.

216
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:54.000
That tells you like they go crazy when they drink and you're like no you're actually just when you drink you actually are crazy and you're able to keep it.

217
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:05.000
I tell you put the alcohol in you know you actually are crazy and it just comes out yes very similar.

218
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Here we go back to the book so you want a command how often if we heard an officer say I do anything to get a command.

219
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Have you ever wondered if you really meant it have you ever wondered if you really would make a good commander.

220
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:31.000
We have often heard the expression a good commander is born not made this is interesting so he's saying hey we often hear a good commander is born not made.

221
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You know how nowadays they say you know actually anyone can be a leader.

222
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
I shouldn't say it's such a sarcastic voice people say look anyone can be a leader you can learn.

223
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
What I talked about leaders of strategy and tactics is it's both like you're going to get some natural qualities for sure some other things you're going to have to work in.

224
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So he says we often hear heard the expression a good commander is born not made he says this is not entirely true.

225
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000
By exercising certain principles the vast majority of officers can become good commanders there you go he agrees with me.

226
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Let us see if considering the following 20 questions will provide us with some guidelines if the answers to these questions are yes the potential commander statement is sincere and he should fight to get it and should be given a command.

227
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
He will never have an assignment that will give him greater sounds fraction or one that will enable him to contribute more to the army and to our country.

228
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
So here's the 20 questions.

229
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Is the officer seeking command duty willing to devote all hours of day and night seven days a week to his command.

230
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Is his wife willing to take an active role in helping to make a happy army community in their unit area.

231
00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Is his family willing to be secondary if necessary to the company battalion group regimen combat command brigade or division.

232
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So glad you wrote that because I still have people that will call me out because I'll say hey when I was in the teams the teams came first the teams were more important than my family and I'm sorry.

233
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
But you have to take care of your guys you have to.

234
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000
You mean when you would say things like I'm going to go home and see this woman and these kids that live at my house.

235
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Yes, and just for the record, Jago was, Jago is a loving husband and awesome dad, but we knew that was a joke.

236
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
That's pretty funny.

237
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Is he willing to learn teach stress and live with the fundamentals necessary to make his unit good and believe his great talents for bigger things are not to be wasted.

238
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Does he like to be with young people can he live with their energy points of view and problems they create?

239
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Is he willing to take the hard knocks that come from carrying the responsibilities for the failures of his subordinates?

240
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Do we get the past these things on echo Charles?

241
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I don't think so. No, we don't.

242
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Sounds a little like he's training hard or shit.

243
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Sir, he does.

244
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Can he Jago at the same time all the balls of training maintenance test administration inspections property communications messes supplies athletics,

245
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Marksmanship discipline and public relations without dropping any of them.

246
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:36.000
I or does an execute is he able to do many things concurrently rather than being a consecutive do or can he manage a complex job?

247
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Can he receive and carry out orders? Can he follow orders as well as give them?

248
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.000
So number eight there is he able to do many things concurrently rather than being a consecutive do or opposite of prior exercise next.

249
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
It's like I'm going to I need to be able to do multiple things at once.

250
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Here's what's interesting.

251
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I highlighted that and I started I was thinking about it as I read through the rest of the book.

252
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:09.000
He starts to go into a a delineation and a bifurcation between between the title of book leader and commander.

253
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000
And what he starts talking about is when you're a leader, squad leader, put two leader at company it changes to commander.

254
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
And now what you have to do is realize that you've got to you've got to be able to task people to do things right you got to be able to delegate.

255
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And so as a leader it's like prioritize next you as a commander. Yes, you're going to prioritize next.

256
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
But you're going to prioritize delegate and then have other people doing multiple things at the same time.

257
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.000
I mean when we were going on an operation for example, did we say okay right now we're only going to set security.

258
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
We're not going to do sensitive site exploitation.

259
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We're not going to do a search right now. We're only going to set security. No, we set security.

260
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Then we start interrogating prisoners. We start searching. We start organizing.

261
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
There's multiple things that you're doing at the same time.

262
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
So that's different than hey, we've got we've got we're getting attacked with multiple problems right now.

263
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
We need to focus on the biggest problem.

264
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And it also starts to lean into talking about delegation and how and you know, I've always said even when I'd explain prioritize next.

265
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I say these words. Once you've got that problem solved or you've got it going in the right direction, then you can move on to the next problem.

266
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
So if I look if we're getting a contact from the south and I go late, take it between go start knocking those guys out.

267
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
I don't even worry about you anymore. I'm good.

268
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Like I might check in with you five minutes later to make sure you're good, but meanwhile what am I doing?

269
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I'm saying Seth, I'll continue the assault on this building, right?

270
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It's not like I'm saying everyone Seth, everyone on mine.

271
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:53.000
No, if you can handle it, you handle it. Another way you used to explain this is let's say you're building a building.

272
00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And you've got to get one of the rooms electrical done because they're going to put drywall in that room today.

273
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And you've got ten electricians on site and the room is small.

274
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Does that mean you take all ten of your electricians and you pack them in at that room and put them all to work?

275
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Because it's there, you don't need that many you need for guys in there.

276
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
That's the fastest and most efficient you can get it done.

277
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So you take those for guys, you put them in that room and you take the other six guys and they can start doing something else.

278
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
You don't just say that's the number one priority everyone just sitting there and do nothing.

279
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
For guys do it and everyone wants to watch them.

280
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
No, you handle the problem, you get it moving in the right direction, then you move on to the next.

281
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
You then you can take the remaining resources and apply them to the next thing.

282
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000
That makes me think about target fixation, which is what we talk about with the experiment with with the prioritized next year, which it's really easy.

283
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Like this is the priority to get so focused on that.

284
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
But I mean, the example you just gave like, life take your built-in and take you hit that target the south and then south you continue to the assault.

285
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Like you wouldn't even say it's safe continue to the south because he's going to do it.

286
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And you talk about how your greatest goal is to go out on operations and not say anything.

287
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And I used to think that like that was like, I wanted to be the leader like the John Wayne, Sans of Evil Gima with my helmet on sideways and my gun and highport is my finger is point.

288
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000
You know, like the classic army man with a finger pointing and his leader with his is his gun and highport pointed to the sky.

289
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And so many times for money in the middle of a big gunfight where you're like, I'm not saying anything at all.

290
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.000
My team's doing what they need to do the fire team leaders are running their guys are squad leaders running their guys are the leading petty officers doing his thing the chiefs doing his thing.

291
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I can think to steps ahead.

292
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
So I mean, that's you have to be able to do that.

293
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000
That's decentralized command and when you had a team that's running that then you can you can handle 12 or 15 problems the same time because each of the teams is doing their thing.

294
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.000
I was talking to a client today and he was talking to me about how he sometimes has meetings.

295
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:13.000
He'll have eight blocked meetings a day or ten that he has to go to and he gets done. He's like, yeah, I know I got this meeting this meeting and I had him pull up his calendar and he's talking me through each one of these meetings.

296
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:26.000
And I said, um, what's wrong with you? Like what is wrong with you that every like each one of your teams needs to talk to you every single day.

297
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
That's crazy to me. That's crazy to me.

298
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
That's not decentralized command. That is centralized command. So you aren't given the people the right direction. They're not hearing what you're saying.

299
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:49.000
They don't have the guidelines you haven't given them the trust. Do you been an easy, but there's a bunch of reasons why it could be happening, but it shouldn't be happening. You shouldn't have to attend those meetings all day long every day.

300
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Because that's not decentralized command. It's not efficient.

301
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
What happens if you aren't in those meetings? Well, the guys want no to do. Okay, well, there's your problem.

302
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Give them the guidance and let them run. And if you're down on the weeds trying to solve those problems, which is what you're doing in the meetings, then you can't. Who's actually taking a step back?

303
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
But that's, you know, when you wrote in that the decentralized command chapter, an extreme ownership that.

304
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
I mean, we, we, that would have been a horrible blue on blue situation that happened. If you were down on the weeds trying to tell, you know, stoner,

305
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:29.000
sestone had to run his buto, you know, that's just the way it is. So I think that's your job as the leader should be to take a step back and thanks strategically.

306
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
The next step, the next step out for that. And you can't if you're down on the weeds and make it make it make it make it make it.

307
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And, but you can also see where people need help and you could step in temporarily when you take a step back and you got teams actually handling those problems, which you did all the time as a ground force commander when you're like, come over.

308
00:41:46.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I'm talking to the house, we call it target security, welcome that's what's going on. Check in with me. I give you a quick update on what's going on. You kind of, then you'd move to kind of where you were needed, you know, where people might need more resources or hey, we need some more guys outside, you know, can we, can you guys spare a fire team?

309
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Or hey, when you're more guys in the house, let's bring a fire team in or whatever, maybe.

310
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Yep, you know, got to do that.

311
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Continue and down this list. Can he receive and carry out orders? Can he follow orders as well as give them?

312
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Can he stand tough competition from like units and still retain a spirit of cooperation and teamwork with him?

313
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:40.000
That's outside the wire. Is he physically and emotionally fit to carry the load? That's what you and I just talked about. I talked about the mental side, you talked about the physical side, they're both freaking grueling.

314
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Does he have the courage to make and stand by tough decisions? Are he and his family willing to live in a goldfish bowl where their actions are closely observed by both subordinate and superior?

315
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Is he still enthusiastic and cheerful when confronted with seemingly impossible tasks to perform with inadequate means?

316
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Is he willing to leave a warm office to check and supervise training maintenance and many other activities of his unit? Is he willing to take responsibility himself and correct the situation rather than blame it on the staff of a higher head quarters or on a subordinate when things go wrong in his unit?

317
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Man, we owe this guy some money.

318
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That's pretty phenomenal. He's capturing the burden of leadership so well. By obviously someone who's been and lived in a multitude of levels.

319
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I think so often we talk to frontline troopers or frontline leaders. If I wasn't the senior rigs, everything would be great and they don't fully understand the burden of leadership. That's a tough thing, not everybody can do that. And there are a lot of people that don't want that.

320
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
And I think once they get there, they realize maybe that ain't for me.

321
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Next, is he willing to do the best with what he has even though what he has seems inadequate? Is he confident he can produce a superior unit with the usual run of manpower?

322
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Can he inspire personnel to produce outstanding accomplishments? Is he willing to take a chance on being relieved for attaining only mediocre results?

323
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Does he really want command rather than just to get command on his record?

324
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And I just realized he's got a lot of these 20 questions. There's like three or four questions in each one. He snuck some in on us.

325
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:51.000
But what a great outline, just to just to check yourself and see where you're at. See how in the game you are.

326
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Next, what does the soldier expect from his commander?

327
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Having dealt with the prerequisites of command. So that's what we just did. I offer these thoughts on what soldiers look for in their commanders regardless of branch of service.

328
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Honest, just and fair treatment, men admire a strict officer if he is also just.

329
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And officer who tries to be a good fellow loses his grip early and officer cannot be expected to know everything. He cannot bluff his men and retain their respect.

330
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000
When he does not know, he should say so and then find an announce the answer.

331
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Like we're laughing as reading this, you're laughing as a reading this. This is like straight out of leadership strategy and tactics.

332
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Just it's crazy to sit here and read this. You asked that question all the time like who's got it all figured out who has all the answers and nobody. So why would you even try to pretend like you do people.

333
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
You know, and then we get that question for the leaders like well the lose respect for me.

334
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
You know if I if I like I've got to pretend like I know it all and like no everyone knows you don't know at all. So so they know you don't know and if you're pretending they're losing respect for you.

335
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
If you can actually admit you don't know and take ownership, then it over mistake, whatever it happened, then obviously they respect is going up.

336
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I'll tell you another tricky situation that this offers some insight into it. It doesn't offer a different answer, but I've seen leaders back into a corner where you know,

337
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:35.000
like you know, late screwed something up and whatever the mitigating circumstances were, you know, I say you know what though, late it's I got a punishment.

338
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000
You know, late late didn't finish the project on time. I'm writing him up. I told him I was going to write him up. I'm going to write him up and let you know you come to me and say hey boss, I get it.

339
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I'm going to give you some mistakes that I made and I go yep, doesn't matter right new up and I feel like I'm going to lose respect of people if I don't be like drop the hammer on you.

340
00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:10.000
And the fact of the matter is you don't if you're if you're a reasonable human being and you understood you you listen to the mitigating circumstances of situation and say, you know what I really hope that this doesn't happen again.

341
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:22.000
I'm going to let you off the hook. But you came to me with a plan on how you're going to fix these things don't ever allow to happen again.

342
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:36.000
You respect for me doesn't go down people don't think oh, jocquoise weak they think we got a boss it's going to take care of our people. Now look, if you have somebody that's just out of you know does something totally off the wall, of course, punishment must be dealt out.

343
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And it's a week to be reasonable I guess that sums it up.

344
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Conspeaking of punishment a commander should administer punishment in an impersonal way and to a degree that fits the circumstances and the offense.

345
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000
When a man pays his debt the commander should fit forget the incident.

346
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:16.000
I know like you might have a repeat of fact. I get it bro, I get you general clerk, but that one you know you know and I think what he's saying there what what I interpret that as is is what you talk about when the first chapter of extreme ownership this horrible blue on blue situation that was tragic that was terrible.

347
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:28.000
And you know the you know our commanding officers coming to to you know find out what happened and we think okay man they're probably going to fire someone for this and there's a lot of stake and then you talk about by taking ownership.

348
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
My implement and a plan to make sure that never happen again the boss actually his trust increased and you rather than decrease so.

349
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:45.000
And I think when people take ownership and the implement a solution to make sure that you see hey there fixing that problem. You are gaining trusted and even if something bad happened so it's not that you're.

350
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
It's not that you're forgetting about it, but you're certainly like you're not holding it against.

351
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Yeah, and I think that's the key thing isn't that's not the literal term forget but you know I'm not going to look at you and go well you know.

352
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I don't know, Dave last time you didn't quite do that. Did you do no it's okay you you you major mistake we figured out what the punishment is going to be you did your time for your crime we're going to move on and I'm not going to hold it over your head that being said.

353
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:25.000
You know I'm paying attention make it sure you're not a repeat offender courage every man experiences fear in a crisis the commander cannot show it he must fortify himself by learning to control his emotions.

354
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:48.000
I'm not crazy to read consideration. Do them so this is again this is all into the topic what does the soldier expect from his commander consideration do them as mature professional soldiers regardless of age or grade soldiers should be treated as mature individuals they are men engaged in honorable profession and deserve to be treated as such.

355
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I'm going to start between officers observation of these currencies between seniors and subordinates is not belittling to either their evidences of the alertness pride and good manners of your men.

356
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:16.000
The commanders rank should be used to serve his subordinates it is not a reward and is not a license to an exercise idiocync crazy rank has one object to enable the officer to fulfill his responsibilities.

357
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Subordinates expect the commander to play his part according to his position they do not regret but grudge him his rank if he uses them if he uses it in the interest of his subordinates and superiors.

358
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:48.000
So if you're using your rank in the interest of your troops we're good. If you're using it for yourself we got to miss you we got a problem you know that part about the professional these are professionals treat them like professionals.

359
00:50:48.000 --> 00:51:02.000
It's a reminder of our experience in the remote working alongside us soldiers and Marines and someone you always said about these guys are true professionals they're.

360
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And it was interesting how there are some special operators that did not treat them that way because they felt like oh they were special and they went through some you know specialized training and they were part of a specialized unit and they had better gear whatever and.

361
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:40.000
And they were looking at us like oh man the Seals are you and they look at our short barrel little rifles and our cool gear and we had better night vision all this stuff and I'm looking back at these young private's thinking man these guys have fired more rounds of their weapons and all of us put together in the entire task unit are ever going to fire and our.

362
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:54.000
The entire careers in the SEAL teams I mean that's how much combat they were seeing and it was just.

363
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000
What an honor and privilege of being I mean they were they were absolute professionals and that served as well by treating them accordingly.

364
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:18.000
But it's like one of those little golden rules. Why is this so hard treat people with respect treat people respect it's it treat people respect.

365
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Personal interest taken in them as individuals again what is a soldier expect from his commander personal interest taken in them as individuals a good officer will know the names background and individual characteristics of his men he must have a genuine personal interest in them or they will not have it in him.

366
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Each individual has problems there is no easy way of getting a grip on men than by helping them solve their personal problems that give them great concern and officer should not however be too familiar with his men.

367
00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Good soldiers do not expect it and usually resent it is not necessary to call soldiers by their first names even if the officer sleeps in the same fox old them.

368
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000
But not too close as we like to say that that caught me of leadership.

369
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Yeah, you know that the the expression and I I didn't ever hear anyone say this.

370
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And I started saying it a little while ago I don't know maybe it's not an I don't know I'm not trying to take credit for something.

371
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:39.000
But you know you know the term that we'd say and the teams which was take care your gear in your girl take, are you which is means Hey when you get done with a dive you take your dive rig and you do the proper maintenance on it.

372
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
When you get done with the pepper parachute jump you take your parish and you do proper maintenance on it when you get done with a firefight or operation you take your weapon into the proper maintenance.

373
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.80
proper maintenance, are you take your your gear and your gear will be there to take

374
00:53:45.80 --> 00:53:50.44
your you same thing with people you take your people and your people will take care of you.

375
00:53:52.84 --> 00:53:57.72
That's true. As you say in the thumb, I'm taking out some of those tax messages that you've

376
00:53:57.72 --> 00:54:03.000
said echo Charles. Those things are going to become public I think. Yeah, might tell a

377
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.24
different story in a little way, but why is it so hard for people to respect people? There's no

378
00:54:09.24 --> 00:54:18.68
respect whatsoever. My text messages to echo Charles, they do have a high level of disrespect.

379
00:54:18.68 --> 00:54:23.40
And this also brings to the fact that I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm not 100% sure.

380
00:54:23.40 --> 00:54:29.72
I believe that I have a certain guard passing technique that is called the disrespect.

381
00:54:29.72 --> 00:54:34.92
Literally. That I actually named because of you because I would use this guard pass and it's

382
00:54:34.92 --> 00:54:41.64
so disrespectful that you would you would feel disrespected. Did you think of that? No, you did.

383
00:54:42.92 --> 00:54:49.56
I remember very vividly. Expand. I like this. You know after it's just very disrespectful.

384
00:54:49.56 --> 00:54:55.80
That's it. Yeah, I think that's a good question. Is it that hard to to be respectful?

385
00:54:55.80 --> 00:55:03.64
And apparently it is. So, yeah, man. There's a fine line between Jess and

386
00:55:03.64 --> 00:55:08.68
Jess from SPAC. Maybe a little more of a gray area. Yeah, yeah, it gets blurry sometimes.

387
00:55:08.68 --> 00:55:15.96
I find some good screenshots and let's post some some Jocco echo texts. I think that'll be

388
00:55:15.96 --> 00:55:24.76
flood. Okay. Back to the book. There's nothing wrong today with the following instructions written

389
00:55:24.76 --> 00:55:32.20
by Baron Vaughn, Stubin at Valley Forge and published in the continent published by the

390
00:55:32.20 --> 00:55:39.48
continental Congress. Instructions for the captain. A captain cannot be too careful of the company.

391
00:55:41.72 --> 00:55:47.96
A captain cannot be too careful of the company. The state has committed to his charge.

392
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.04
He must pay the greatest attention to the health of his men, their discipline, arms,

393
00:55:54.04 --> 00:56:04.44
accoutrements, ammunition, clothes, and necessary. His first object should be to gain the love of

394
00:56:04.44 --> 00:56:11.56
his men by treating them with every possible kindness and humanity and acquiring into their complaints

395
00:56:11.56 --> 00:56:18.28
and when well-founded seeing them redressed. He should know every man of his company by name and character.

396
00:56:18.28 --> 00:56:24.60
He should often visit those who are sick, speak tenderly to them, see that the public provision

397
00:56:24.60 --> 00:56:31.24
weather of medicine or diet is duly administered and procure them besides such comforts and

398
00:56:31.24 --> 00:56:37.96
conveniences as are in his power. The attachment that arises from this kind of attention to the

399
00:56:37.96 --> 00:56:46.76
second wounded is almost inconceivable. It will moreover by the means of preserving the lives of many

400
00:56:46.76 --> 00:56:56.76
valuable men. So there you go. What a incredible thing to be able to read.

401
00:56:56.76 --> 00:57:07.64
Instructions for a captain from Valley Forge. That's powerful. It's humbling as well too.

402
00:57:07.64 --> 00:57:13.40
I think about all of my shortcomings and how much I could have used that guidance directly

403
00:57:13.40 --> 00:57:19.24
prior to being a chartered-up-attuned commander or even now just reviewing that and thinking about it.

404
00:57:21.24 --> 00:57:27.08
It captures, I think, like I said, the burden of leadership and a massive way and all of its

405
00:57:27.08 --> 00:57:32.20
acquired of you, which is a lot. Everything, under-person, all the time.

406
00:57:33.64 --> 00:57:37.96
And if you take care of your men, you're going to take care of you. And if you have this,

407
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:46.84
if you have this inconceivable attachment, what that does is deserves the hives.

408
00:57:47.64 --> 00:57:54.76
So when you are a tight unit, I've often said that the thing that makes a seal platoon strong

409
00:57:55.88 --> 00:58:03.32
is just the bonds that you have. That's what's going to make the difference. In any military,

410
00:58:03.32 --> 00:58:07.48
you're not just the seal. I mean, I can talk about the seal platoon because I've been in them, but any

411
00:58:07.48 --> 00:58:12.92
military unit. What is it that makes a really strong unit? It's how tight they are and what makes

412
00:58:12.92 --> 00:58:20.04
people tight? You take care of them. It's it. It goes on. Instructions for the Lieutenant.

413
00:58:22.04 --> 00:58:28.44
He should endeavor to gain the love of his men by his attention to everything which may contribute

414
00:58:28.44 --> 00:58:33.40
to their health and convenience. He should often visit them at different hours, inspect their

415
00:58:33.40 --> 00:58:38.68
manner of living. See that their provisions are good and well-cooked and as far as possible,

416
00:58:38.68 --> 00:58:44.20
obliged them to take their meals at regulated hours. He should pay attention to their complaints

417
00:58:44.76 --> 00:58:49.80
and when well-founded endeavor to get them redressed, but discourage them from complaining on

418
00:58:49.80 --> 00:58:55.16
every frivolous occasion. So for the captain and for the Lieutenant, what are you trying to do?

419
00:58:55.16 --> 00:58:58.76
You're trying to build relationships with your team. You're trying to take care of your people.

420
00:59:01.32 --> 00:59:04.68
And by the way, those are the instructions. Not one. That's it.

421
00:59:08.04 --> 00:59:11.72
Next. I was just going to say, I think that's the most profound thing to me.

422
00:59:11.72 --> 00:59:18.44
You think if Hachor of the saying, everyone, every officer should be required to read this,

423
00:59:19.08 --> 00:59:22.84
you would think it's going to be talking about tactics. You would know how to set up,

424
00:59:22.84 --> 00:59:29.000
you know, based a fire and your assault elements or how to position your troops and it's not

425
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.84
that at all. It's all about building relationships with your team. What's required of you to actually

426
00:59:34.84 --> 00:59:43.08
be a leader? It's how you manage and lead and that's pretty phenomenal. And you said at all

427
00:59:43.08 --> 00:59:51.000
a time, something that we talk about often which is the hardest part of combat leadership is always

428
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.48
the human aspect, not the tactics. That's the easy part. That's when I wrote the forward

429
00:59:57.48 --> 01:00:05.48
for about face, and he turned. He turned against. He said, hey, we can't win this war if we keep

430
01:00:05.48 --> 01:00:14.36
fighting like this. And they asked him how we're talking about that interview, that famous interview,

431
01:00:14.36 --> 01:00:21.64
you know, he gets asked, could you, could you become are you two emotional about the

432
01:00:21.64 --> 01:00:27.48
war in Vietnam? And Hachor says one couldn't have spent the number of years. I spent in Vietnam

433
01:00:27.48 --> 01:00:33.24
without becoming emotionally involved. One couldn't see the number of young studs die or terribly

434
01:00:33.24 --> 01:00:41.16
wounded without becoming emotionally involved. I have just seen the American nation spend so much of

435
01:00:41.16 --> 01:00:46.36
its wonderful, great young men in this country. I have seen our national wealth being drained away.

436
01:00:46.36 --> 01:00:52.44
I see the nation being split a sunder and almost being split apart and almost being split a

437
01:00:52.44 --> 01:00:56.76
sunder because this war and I'm wondering to what end it will lead to. And quote,

438
01:01:00.76 --> 01:01:03.64
you know, like that's a guy that loved his troops.

439
01:01:03.64 --> 01:01:15.08
I can only imagine that burden, you know, with 58,000 dead in the Vietnam war, 58,000 US troops

440
01:01:15.08 --> 01:01:20.04
killed. And because even at the tiny fraction of that number, you know, that we've experienced

441
01:01:20.04 --> 01:01:25.16
in Afghanistan and Iraq, coming back from Iraq when we came back from a body, I think one of the

442
01:01:25.16 --> 01:01:31.08
hardest things for me just after having lost Mark, with Ryan was blind, Mike, you know, we lost

443
01:01:31.08 --> 01:01:38.52
Mike, you dealt with tune. And a good friend of mine who's hopefully going to be on this podcast

444
01:01:38.52 --> 01:01:45.08
with you sometime, Elliott, who was severely wounded and he was in Brook Army Medical Center in San

445
01:01:45.08 --> 01:01:52.36
Antonio, which is the primary burn care facility for all of the US military. And so I went to

446
01:01:52.36 --> 01:01:57.80
spend a much of time with him there and from December for, you know, really through much of like

447
01:01:57.80 --> 01:02:04.12
2007 back there regularly and trying to, you know, just help him, support him as family wherever we could.

448
01:02:04.92 --> 01:02:13.64
And just witnessing those burn victims in there, you know, when Idees that were causing,

449
01:02:13.64 --> 01:02:17.48
you know, the enemy's most valuable weapon and you're walking into those,

450
01:02:17.48 --> 01:02:23.80
besides you, rooms and you're seeing young soldiers and Marines with no lips, no no noses,

451
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:30.28
no ears, just face, you know, faces burned off. It was one of the most horrific things I've

452
01:02:30.28 --> 01:02:35.72
I've ever had experience. And when I would hear people on the news talking about the war and

453
01:02:35.72 --> 01:02:42.92
pontificating about the blood and treasure that we'd spent and they had no inkling of just how

454
01:02:43.16 --> 01:02:50.12
deep and personal that was, you know. And again, that's just a fraction in the Iraq War of

455
01:02:50.12 --> 01:02:55.24
Experience in Vietnam. I can only imagine, for him and for every other Vietnam better and out there.

456
01:02:56.28 --> 01:02:59.72
What that was like. But there's no way to not make that personal.

457
01:03:02.36 --> 01:03:09.64
Yeah, and you can see the root of that is, you know, it's the same root like you said earlier,

458
01:03:09.64 --> 01:03:15.88
these things that you uncover over time, you know, if you take care, if you, if you love your

459
01:03:15.88 --> 01:03:21.24
troops, that's going to be, that's, that's what it's about. And

460
01:03:21.24 --> 01:03:25.80
hackworth knew that. You know that. I know that general Clark knew that. That's the way it is.

461
01:03:32.92 --> 01:03:41.64
Goes on here. Loyalty. Loyalty to superiors and subordinates is a basic requirement.

462
01:03:41.64 --> 01:03:47.64
Criticism of a commander's superiors in front of subordinates lays him open to the same

463
01:03:47.64 --> 01:03:53.000
treatment. He should stand up for his men as he expects them to stand up for him.

464
01:03:55.32 --> 01:04:01.16
You can, you can, you can almost see hackworth's life unfold, right? Like you can see that

465
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:09.40
that statement in everything that he did. And officers presence when the conditions are unpleasant

466
01:04:09.40 --> 01:04:14.04
and when the going is tough, sharing the situation of the men means a great deal to them.

467
01:04:16.76 --> 01:04:23.48
Pick up the brass. The commander should act as a buffer between superiors and subordinates.

468
01:04:24.52 --> 01:04:29.64
He should protect his men from harassment that comes from above, but still get the job done.

469
01:04:34.44 --> 01:04:39.32
Yeah, I know sometimes I would pull back the curtain for a few minutes and like show you

470
01:04:39.32 --> 01:04:46.04
what was happening above me in the chair to command on all different fronts and look,

471
01:04:46.04 --> 01:04:51.16
everyone up above me in the chain of man doing their job, but it's pressure and it's

472
01:04:52.44 --> 01:04:58.84
it's kind of maddening. And sometimes I would be asking you for something and you'd get pissed off

473
01:04:58.84 --> 01:05:02.28
about it, you know, that'll you need this for a night's sake, come here for a minute.

474
01:05:02.28 --> 01:05:06.92
Let me, let me, let you take a look behind this curtain for 15 seconds. You look back there,

475
01:05:06.92 --> 01:05:11.24
see that sausage get made and say, okay, I'm good. I'll get you what you need, I'm out. Thank you.

476
01:05:11.24 --> 01:05:17.24
You did it. You always had a great job of screening us from that. But I think that was very valuable

477
01:05:17.24 --> 01:05:21.64
for me because it gave me a new perspective. You know, like, oh, they're asking us for this,

478
01:05:22.04 --> 01:05:26.20
you know, I'm getting mad about it and then I realize like how much you're actually screening out,

479
01:05:26.20 --> 01:05:30.68
you know, of that harassment. Like, I'm keeping these guys off your back so that you guys can go

480
01:05:30.68 --> 01:05:38.36
do what you need to do. Next, that their needs be anticipated and met a good soldier has needs

481
01:05:39.08 --> 01:05:45.000
both spiritual and physical and the commander should do everything possible to anticipate and meet

482
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.80
those needs at the same time. He should provide all the comforts and privileges practical.

483
01:05:52.20 --> 01:05:57.64
This is not meant to imply that he should cuddle his men or treat them as babies. Like, how

484
01:05:57.64 --> 01:06:02.04
beautiful is this dichotomy? Just when you think, oh, maybe he's a little off track here. Maybe I'm a

485
01:06:02.04 --> 01:06:07.48
little bit no, this does not mean to imply that he should cuddle his men or treat them like babies.

486
01:06:07.48 --> 01:06:12.44
Such things as a hot meal when it is not expected, unit parties, liberal past,

487
01:06:12.44 --> 01:06:15.88
plat-privileges and good recreational facilities are more, more to the point.

488
01:06:18.68 --> 01:06:25.000
Next thing that the soldier expects from his commander to be kept informed and told the reason why

489
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.48
the commander should keep his men informed at all time, tell them the reasons behind decisions

490
01:06:31.48 --> 01:06:36.52
affecting them. Many jobs seem purposeless unless the facts behind them are known.

491
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.44
He should continually take action to offset rumors and speculation by giving his men all the

492
01:06:44.44 --> 01:06:50.12
information he can. Yeah, we all this guy, money, dude. We all this guy, money.

493
01:06:50.12 --> 01:06:57.72
You know what though? You're probably, I mean, obviously there's direct influence

494
01:06:57.72 --> 01:07:05.000
through David Hackworth, you know, in a bow face from General Clark, I think you could go back to

495
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.20
the Greek hop lights or the, you know, the Roman legions and probably find some centurion who's

496
01:07:10.20 --> 01:07:14.44
riding the same stuff. I mean, they're learning the same stuff. Some, some different aspect of

497
01:07:14.44 --> 01:07:19.56
different terminology, a little bit different, you know, a vastly different era millennia apart,

498
01:07:19.56 --> 01:07:25.72
but it's, it's human nature as we just said has a change and I bet there would be something very similar.

499
01:07:27.56 --> 01:07:33.80
And just to make sure everyone realizes we're not just talking about war, we are talking about

500
01:07:33.80 --> 01:07:38.12
leadership, we're talking about leadership and business. You need to tell your people what's going on

501
01:07:38.12 --> 01:07:41.72
and they need to understand why they're doing what they're doing. I'm talking about your family,

502
01:07:41.72 --> 01:07:45.88
they need to understand what's going on and they need to understand why they're doing what they're doing.

503
01:07:45.88 --> 01:07:54.28
And any situation where you're interacting with other human beings, these rules apply.

504
01:07:55.88 --> 01:08:00.92
And they apply to the point, why do we know that they work because they've been tested? We tested them,

505
01:08:00.92 --> 01:08:05.56
but these guys test them and even crazier conditions, harder conditions, three freaking wars.

506
01:08:06.76 --> 01:08:10.04
That's, that's one of the most common things we're getting at Ashlyn front these days is

507
01:08:10.36 --> 01:08:15.56
questions about managing the family schedule and how do I work from home with so many people

508
01:08:15.56 --> 01:08:21.96
still working from home? You know, it's, those are like, a good bulk of the questions are about that

509
01:08:22.28 --> 01:08:26.28
and it's directly applicable. Well, the other thing that's been interesting is with COVID hit,

510
01:08:27.32 --> 01:08:31.000
you know, most of the companies that we work with are good companies that want to be awesome.

511
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.40
We do get some companies that come to us, sometimes against their will brought to us by the

512
01:08:35.40 --> 01:08:40.76
border, whatever that we are going to fix them, help fix them. Most of the companies we work with

513
01:08:40.76 --> 01:08:46.76
are good companies that want to do better when COVID hit. So these companies aren't companies that

514
01:08:46.76 --> 01:08:51.64
are struggling. These are companies that just want to do, you know, better. And so they would implement

515
01:08:51.64 --> 01:08:55.64
the, the principles that we talk about, implement, cover move, implement simple prioritizing

516
01:08:55.64 --> 01:08:59.56
next year, decentralized command, default aggressive, you know, extreme ownership. So they implement

517
01:08:59.56 --> 01:09:05.000
these things and, and yes, they're absolutely start doing better. And we watch them and we get feedback

518
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.24
from them and their profits go and they become more efficient and more effective and they start

519
01:09:09.24 --> 01:09:13.56
taking market share. Everything goes awesome. And it's cool. And everyone goes, hey, yeah, that's great.

520
01:09:13.56 --> 01:09:16.92
And we're super excited about it. When COVID hit and all of a sudden there was companies that

521
01:09:16.92 --> 01:09:26.28
weren't in dire situations and we're able to utilize the principles to survive. Yes, but also

522
01:09:26.28 --> 01:09:32.52
start to actually go on the attack and thrive. That was pretty epic. Because it basically was like,

523
01:09:34.28 --> 01:09:39.16
have you ever, do you ever pull a reserve parachute? Never had. Yeah, I only did it one

524
01:09:39.16 --> 01:09:43.88
time. And all the other times, I'd be like, yeah, cool, you know, I'm got to reserve on the time

525
01:09:43.88 --> 01:09:48.28
that I pulled it. I was like, this thing's freaking awesome, bro. Thank you for backing this

526
01:09:48.28 --> 01:09:53.48
thing correctly. Case appeared in the rigor, you know, because you, because normally it's just like,

527
01:09:53.48 --> 01:09:56.28
yeah, yeah, it's, it's work, you know, it's on there. It's all good. And that's kind of what

528
01:09:56.28 --> 01:10:00.04
companies you. Okay, we're doing really good hair profits are up all these quality positive things.

529
01:10:00.04 --> 01:10:05.24
But also when they're faced with real hardships and challenges, they're like, what should we do

530
01:10:05.24 --> 01:10:11.48
here prioritize next year? Oh, yeah, okay, or die. Oh, if they no longer exist exactly. Hey,

531
01:10:11.48 --> 01:10:14.76
what, you know, we've got this going. We got at least people working at home. What should we do?

532
01:10:14.76 --> 01:10:19.24
This is decentralized command. Yeah, we've been doing that. Well, yeah, now you need to do it harder.

533
01:10:19.24 --> 01:10:22.20
You need to make sure everyone understands what the mission is, what the goal is, what the

534
01:10:22.20 --> 01:10:25.08
end state is. You need to communicate with them. They need to understand why they're doing,

535
01:10:25.08 --> 01:10:30.84
what they're doing. Can, can you make that happen? Yes, we can. Okay, execute. You know,

536
01:10:30.84 --> 01:10:36.52
that makes me think there was an educator. Remember on Eophone line a few weeks ago, as they were

537
01:10:36.52 --> 01:10:42.12
about to go back to school, you know, in her state or her district. She was an educator. She was

538
01:10:42.12 --> 01:10:46.68
talking about how crazy it was and how much uncertainty it was. And you said,

539
01:10:47.96 --> 01:10:52.68
we didn't learn this stuff in a boy scout trip. You know, how this, we learned this on the battlefield.

540
01:10:52.68 --> 01:10:57.56
It was crazy. It was chaotic. There was a lot of stake. There was a lot of uncertainty about what

541
01:10:57.56 --> 01:11:02.36
was going to happen. What you need to do is prioritize an execute. That's where this came from.

542
01:11:02.36 --> 01:11:08.28
I think I know it's getting crazy in that six grade classroom. And I'm telling you, this is going to work.

543
01:11:09.16 --> 01:11:14.36
And it did. She came back and gave us a great set of stuff. It was, she was implementing that

544
01:11:14.36 --> 01:11:21.000
and moving forward and doing great. legit. Next thing that the soldier requires is a well-thought-out

545
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.24
program of training, work and recreation. The commander should keep a balance between training

546
01:11:25.24 --> 01:11:31.72
and recreation too much of either becomes a drag on the men. Logical progression of training helps

547
01:11:31.72 --> 01:11:37.000
the helps keep the men from becoming confused. Yeah, this is exactly what we wrote about

548
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.76
back out of the leadership. Train hard, but train smart. You can smoke people. You can crush

549
01:11:40.76 --> 01:11:47.64
them to the point where they're not getting any benefit anymore. Next, demands, commensurate with

550
01:11:47.64 --> 01:11:54.12
capabilities. Neither too great nor too small. A commander should not overload his men with unnecessary

551
01:11:54.12 --> 01:12:00.44
work. On the other hand, letting men be comforted because they are not working off is just as bad.

552
01:12:01.40 --> 01:12:06.76
Neither men as individuals nor units be expected to accomplish in possible tax. What do you

553
01:12:06.76 --> 01:12:10.60
say? You got a balance at that time. It sounds like general Clark had the same experience with

554
01:12:10.60 --> 01:12:15.000
his soldiers that we always said, like a board team guys, like the most dangerous thing in the

555
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.28
universe because they're going to figure something out to go cause trouble or because create

556
01:12:20.28 --> 01:12:26.36
me because rock fights. That was when I was a young team guy. If there was, if we weren't

557
01:12:26.36 --> 01:12:30.12
being told to do something like sitting around waiting for something, there was a rock fight happening.

558
01:12:30.12 --> 01:12:34.60
You know, all sons and sons just hit you in the leg with a rock from 20 yards and it's a rock

559
01:12:34.60 --> 01:12:40.28
fight or actually actually wasn't rock fights. There was a couple of those, but most of you

560
01:12:40.28 --> 01:12:44.28
we're not talking about like tossing a pebble. You talking about like fucking, no, when it was,

561
01:12:44.28 --> 01:12:49.40
it wasn't rock fights. That's when I was a kid. When I was a kid there was rock fights. And I don't

562
01:12:49.40 --> 01:12:53.80
know what you're even thinking when you're having rock fights. But we had, we had BB gun wars.

563
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:59.24
Yeah, we had BB gun wars too. You're buddy in the leg with your, we had to be on wars. If you got

564
01:12:59.24 --> 01:13:04.84
shot, you got shot, you had to take off one layer of clothing. By the way, zero, I prove we were like

565
01:13:04.84 --> 01:13:10.12
it was just the dumbest thing. What's that? I got hit in the face one. I came home and told my

566
01:13:10.12 --> 01:13:16.52
eyes swollen so shut. And my dad was like, son, what happened to you? I got hit with a spear.

567
01:13:16.52 --> 01:13:20.92
We were having spear wars. You know, sharp and sticks throwing them to each other to hit me.

568
01:13:20.92 --> 01:13:27.000
I mean, it missed my eye by like three millimeters. My dad was like, you're an idiot. Don't ever do that again.

569
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:33.80
Anyway, rock fights. Oh yeah, not rock fights. Hucking rocks at objects. It'd be like, hey,

570
01:13:33.80 --> 01:13:37.48
who can hit that? So I guess it's similar to the pebble, but it'd be like, hey, who can hit that

571
01:13:37.48 --> 01:13:41.16
lamp over there? You know, that street light or something? Well, it started saying they're

572
01:13:41.16 --> 01:13:45.000
hucking rocks at it. Speaking of board team, as in rock fights, so my, my first deployment

573
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.48
for we worked together in testing in Bruser in 2004. So after your first deployment to Iraq,

574
01:13:49.48 --> 01:13:53.24
one of our super solid team guys, you know, in an, in an, in an arpotune,

575
01:13:53.96 --> 01:14:00.60
was throwing rocks through the window of, uh, and got in all kinds of trouble because he damaged this

576
01:14:01.40 --> 01:14:07.08
smash and shattered a window of, of, of this, like, former Saddam Palace. And they literally like,

577
01:14:07.08 --> 01:14:14.20
like pulled in a ward form. I mean, it was crazy. This, this palace had a J. Dam drop with the

578
01:14:14.20 --> 01:14:19.08
metal of it. It was completely like, for some reason, they got all upset that he, like,

579
01:14:19.08 --> 01:14:25.40
shattered the windows. What's his J now? Uh, a giant bomb drop from the sky. It's, it's, it's a,

580
01:14:25.40 --> 01:14:31.000
it's a GPS guy to bomb. God. You have something, something,

581
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.72
joint direct attack munition. I don't know. I don't know. We're going to, I don't know.

582
01:14:35.72 --> 01:14:37.64
I don't know how fast we're going to deal with it. Where's they when you need to,

583
01:14:37.64 --> 01:14:41.48
we're going to deal with it. You know what, there weren't too many times a task in a Bruser,

584
01:14:41.48 --> 01:14:48.36
where we had bored team guys because you always had us busy doing stuff. But the one time that we

585
01:14:48.36 --> 01:14:56.76
did let it go, um, the Andrew Paul got volunteered to demonstrate the new tasers that we got.

586
01:14:56.76 --> 01:15:02.36
I remember that. And Chris Kyle, tazed him and everyone sat around filming it and

587
01:15:02.36 --> 01:15:07.16
laughing Andrew said that was the worst experience in the entire life. The cool thing there was

588
01:15:07.16 --> 01:15:13.16
safety officer there that someone someone made like we put out the Jitsu mats because this was

589
01:15:13.16 --> 01:15:19.000
remember we're new Jitsu in the morning and the high bay there and I forget, you know, I heard

590
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
someone came like, hey, Joko, they're about to taste Andrew Paul. I'm like, up to work. I'm like,

591
01:15:23.96 --> 01:15:27.88
all right, I better go to your earmuffs. Did you go, Jay? I don't, I don't even remember.

592
01:15:27.88 --> 01:15:30.76
I might have been one of those things where I was like, all right, let the boys do what the

593
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:35.24
boys are going to do. Maybe I just saw the video. Yeah, I think he's probably saw the,

594
01:15:35.24 --> 01:15:39.88
I saw the video, but I saw that there was a mat. They took our green, they were actually my

595
01:15:39.88 --> 01:15:45.08
mats. They took them, put them down underneath to, he fell face down on the freaking mat. Thankfully.

596
01:15:46.68 --> 01:15:50.52
Yeah, that's a bored team guys bad. Didn't he say he was going to fight through it?

597
01:15:54.52 --> 01:16:00.20
I think so. He did not fight through it. Andrew tells a tough, tough dude, but that

598
01:16:00.20 --> 01:16:05.32
days are talking about. All right, back to the book. Guide lines to orders.

599
01:16:08.20 --> 01:16:13.80
Give orders. This is ridiculous. Give orders in a manner which indicates you expect compliance.

600
01:16:13.80 --> 01:16:20.52
Do not issue orders. You cannot enforce. Give clear, complete, correct orders and follow them.

601
01:16:20.52 --> 01:16:24.76
I mean, the reason I said this ridiculous is because it's just crazy that the actual

602
01:16:24.76 --> 01:16:30.12
verbiage that we use when we brief is, you know, give simple clear, concise guidance. And here they're

603
01:16:30.12 --> 01:16:36.92
saying, clear, complete, correct. Only by long and careful training can the commander achieve

604
01:16:36.92 --> 01:16:43.48
perfection in giving orders. Ambiguity, vagueness, and incompleteness of orders are to blame for the

605
01:16:43.48 --> 01:16:53.000
most disobedience and failure to comply. Which is when I say, if your team isn't doing what you,

606
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.52
what you want them to do, the very first person you should check is yourself. And here it is.

607
01:16:57.96 --> 01:17:03.000
And yet that's so hard for any of us to do. You get frustrated with the person from not doing what

608
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.24
you wanted them to do. And instead of actually looking at yourself and saying, hey, okay,

609
01:17:07.24 --> 01:17:13.88
obviously I wasn't clear. I could have done a better job. The words of an order indicate what is

610
01:17:13.88 --> 01:17:19.48
to be done. The manner in which it delivers generates the spirit in which it will be carried out.

611
01:17:19.48 --> 01:17:28.36
Alloy orders should be repeated back. Failure to do so will most assuredly result in a

612
01:17:28.36 --> 01:17:36.36
grave misunderstanding. Only by long and careful training can men learn to receive obey and pass on orders

613
01:17:36.36 --> 01:17:45.56
to others. Lack of orders does not relieve a commander from acting. You must strive to

614
01:17:45.56 --> 01:17:52.28
maintain a complete picture of the situation so you can take suitable action in the absence of orders.

615
01:17:54.68 --> 01:18:03.48
It is a wise officer who refrains from criticism until he can make logical, constructive suggestions.

616
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:11.16
An officer should be as good as his word. He should not make promises. He cannot keep or make

617
01:18:11.16 --> 01:18:21.96
decisions. He cannot support. Just perfect guidance on how you tell people what it did you want

618
01:18:21.96 --> 01:18:32.20
to know, how you give orders. The combat commander, a positive leadership, battle appears to

619
01:18:32.20 --> 01:18:37.88
add peculiar problems to command. But when further analyze the problems are merely magnifications

620
01:18:37.88 --> 01:18:42.12
of those present in training. The great difference between combat and training is the presence of

621
01:18:42.12 --> 01:18:47.56
danger and confusion in combat. These two obstacles can be overcome only by positive leadership

622
01:18:47.56 --> 01:18:52.12
and by developing a positive and automatic reaction in the individual soldier.

623
01:18:54.52 --> 01:19:00.44
That's cool. It says this like we absolutely added confusion, massive amounts of confusion into

624
01:19:00.44 --> 01:19:06.12
our training to simulate the we couldn't you know you can't shoot people obviously during training.

625
01:19:06.12 --> 01:19:10.68
You can't add that element of danger but you certainly can't add some freaking confusion.

626
01:19:10.68 --> 01:19:16.28
Yeah, the term I think I always use was chaos and mayhem. You know like, like activate chaos and

627
01:19:16.28 --> 01:19:21.08
mayhem and your trade instructors were awesome to do that. They weren't very awesome at doing that.

628
01:19:21.08 --> 01:19:25.56
These positive traits of the commander and of the soldier are acquired during training,

629
01:19:25.56 --> 01:19:29.96
training in peace, training in wartime before combat, training during battle and by mental

630
01:19:29.96 --> 01:19:37.24
factors not easily described, desire to overcome the enemy devotion to country and to organization

631
01:19:37.24 --> 01:19:44.12
and personal devotion to the commander. When a disciplined unit is spurred by the mental drives

632
01:19:44.12 --> 01:19:52.92
mentioned, it fights not only well but brilliantly. Those are some awesome things to strive for.

633
01:19:52.92 --> 01:19:59.88
The willingness to overcome the enemy devotion to country and organization and personal

634
01:19:59.88 --> 01:20:11.96
devotion to the commander. Battle is fought for real money and for keeps battles are won by teamwork,

635
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:18.44
not by individuals acting alone. The only teamwork that can stand up under the confusion and

636
01:20:18.44 --> 01:20:24.76
constant danger, feeling of fear and physical exhaustion is the battle of instinctive teamwork.

637
01:20:24.76 --> 01:20:31.40
Success in combat is do largely to endurance on the battlefield the day after day strain of

638
01:20:31.40 --> 01:20:36.28
living in the dirt of going without sleeping food, of the constant threat of death will cause

639
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:43.24
men, cause the man who is physically or mentally weak to quit. Fateege makes cowards.

640
01:20:43.24 --> 01:20:54.52
Men in good physical condition are the last to tire. I would definitely agree with that for sure.

641
01:20:55.72 --> 01:20:59.96
You know what, Phil Man? I was just thinking about that going through the strain and stress of

642
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:04.92
like I think I just think about the support of the team. You were talking about the

643
01:21:04.92 --> 01:21:11.96
bonds between teams and relationships and just that attitude. You know, you talked about the

644
01:21:11.96 --> 01:21:17.72
respect of the commander and obviously we always know whenever we want to let you down into you

645
01:21:17.72 --> 01:21:23.80
bruise or clearly. But I think understanding the mission and just looking at another guy that

646
01:21:23.80 --> 01:21:29.80
you could be under fire in a crazy situation and I look at like Tony, Tony, but I look back at you

647
01:21:29.80 --> 01:21:35.16
or even that situation I said earlier were Dave Burr, a couple of our guys ran down to

648
01:21:35.88 --> 01:21:40.44
grab the palatable water like interact with you or when you came down for delivery

649
01:21:40.44 --> 01:21:45.56
to resupply us. You know, you're just showing up for just a few minutes checking us out,

650
01:21:45.56 --> 01:21:50.60
seeing how things are going. And I think just the look and you're out like hey cool how

651
01:21:50.60 --> 01:21:55.96
things going down here. It's no matter what the physical strain is on you, you know, or what you're

652
01:21:55.96 --> 01:22:01.72
going through mental strain. It's I think that support of your teammates around you and like the attitude

653
01:22:02.28 --> 01:22:07.48
particularly the kind of attitude of humor in I think the midst of some really dire situations.

654
01:22:07.48 --> 01:22:16.52
I think it was always super helpful for us. Yeah. That the attitude that people have,

655
01:22:17.56 --> 01:22:22.52
any I would love to tell you it's leaders but as you know full well it's not just leaders. It

656
01:22:22.52 --> 01:22:28.36
can be anyone in the pollton. Anyone on a team, anyone in the organization when things are going bad

657
01:22:28.36 --> 01:22:33.96
and someone says dude we got this you know or whatever someone instead of saying oh you know hey

658
01:22:33.96 --> 01:22:38.92
we got to roll out again. You're going to be kidding me someone goes good let's bring it. You know like

659
01:22:38.92 --> 01:22:46.52
that little thing the best example or man there it is and the best example I can think of is

660
01:22:46.52 --> 01:22:51.96
we'd wrote about in the planning chapter of of extrem ownership which you know me and everyone

661
01:22:51.96 --> 01:22:55.80
knows this jock over about the launch on that hostage rescue operation and me and you're sitting

662
01:22:55.80 --> 01:23:01.64
in there and and butters are you know Intel and since it comes rolling and it goes they got a ID

663
01:23:01.64 --> 01:23:05.72
spirit in the yard and bulk up machine gun positions the house and you just looked at me and

664
01:23:05.72 --> 01:23:11.32
with this big smile on your face like I guess you guys are going to get some and I was like I

665
01:23:11.32 --> 01:23:15.96
guess we are I mean if that's and that attitude instead of being like you know if you look at me like

666
01:23:15.96 --> 01:23:20.36
oh no yeah do you think you know maybe we shouldn't go on this you know it was like no you just

667
01:23:20.36 --> 01:23:24.92
started you were like smiling laughing about it not look obviously we'd planned and for

668
01:23:24.92 --> 01:23:29.24
contingencies a place that we weren't being call us about it but it was that attitude was contagious

669
01:23:29.24 --> 01:23:33.80
for everybody you know are markly rolling out on the as the lead turret gunner like

670
01:23:34.52 --> 01:23:41.24
mark if you're lucky tonight like everybody's a winner you know so pay attention that

671
01:23:41.24 --> 01:23:50.52
because it's real easy it's real easy it's really easy to let that bad attitude come out

672
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:55.32
and you just stifle that thing you just need to stifle it and anybody that wants to talk to me

673
01:23:55.32 --> 01:24:02.84
about being transparent and showing your feelings I'll say no no actually just be quiet just

674
01:24:02.84 --> 01:24:08.12
shut up and what you need to do is you go oh this is gonna suck and I'll look at lathe and say

675
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:12.68
this you guys are gonna get some watch this let's go bring it

676
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:23.000
the importance of endurance on the battlefield is underlined by grants philosophy the idea that in

677
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.64
every battle that may come a moment when each side is fought out and ready to quit and the belief

678
01:24:29.64 --> 01:24:35.16
that in such a moment victory will go to the side which is able to make one final effort

679
01:24:38.76 --> 01:24:44.36
in the heat of a firefight the poor commander will not be able to lead men into danger

680
01:24:44.36 --> 01:24:50.20
to make them attack or keep order when he and his men are under hostile artillery fire he won't

681
01:24:50.20 --> 01:24:56.36
be able to execute his plans instead his men will forget teamwork and follow their own plans

682
01:24:56.36 --> 01:25:01.16
in fighting for survival therefore you must take every opportunity to make your men confident in your

683
01:25:01.16 --> 01:25:09.32
ability to command and of the skill and toughness of your unit unit morale the prospect of entering

684
01:25:09.32 --> 01:25:17.32
battle puts every soldier under severe nervous strain dangers real and imaginary are thick around

685
01:25:17.32 --> 01:25:22.76
them the commander can overcome much of this strain and strengthen the mental endurance of his

686
01:25:22.76 --> 01:25:30.04
men by teaching them in advance what to expect an event for scene and prepared for will have

687
01:25:30.04 --> 01:25:39.32
little harmful effect you were talking about the grants philosophy there and I was thinking about

688
01:25:40.12 --> 01:25:45.48
Chamberlain at Gettysburg we're just at Gettysburg for Eiff battle field and I mean they you know

689
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:50.84
he in the the 20th main charged fixed bandets and charged down the hill and low round top that was

690
01:25:50.84 --> 01:25:56.60
the absolute last inch ever they didn't have any ammo I mean it was it was it was you know

691
01:25:56.60 --> 01:26:01.000
millimeters close to losing that battle and that would have changed the entire

692
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.60
title of battle you know if if we're around top of it taken so I think that's such a phenomenal

693
01:26:06.60 --> 01:26:12.36
example of to me that's that default aggressive mindset of like hey okay we're going to be

694
01:26:12.36 --> 01:26:17.48
default aggressive to to continue this and that one last bush is going to change the the entire outcome

695
01:26:18.84 --> 01:26:24.36
there's a famous boxing match with Muhammad Ali and I want to say I want to say

696
01:26:28.28 --> 01:26:35.40
I can't remember which match it was but it is a brutal boxing match and at one point

697
01:26:36.28 --> 01:26:40.04
both fight Muhammad Ali's all beat up in whoever he was fighting my forget it was a

698
01:26:40.04 --> 01:26:48.04
it was incredible fight but he gets back to his corner and he's telling his corner

699
01:26:48.04 --> 01:26:53.08
caught him off he's done caught my gloves off I'm done and basically his corners like you

700
01:26:53.08 --> 01:26:56.28
got you know you got to keep going and they look over the other guy didn't answer the bell

701
01:26:57.16 --> 01:27:01.000
so like that's that's where it's at like if you you can give up right there

702
01:27:02.12 --> 01:27:06.76
that's something to think about you know like can you just go a little bit more

703
01:27:06.76 --> 01:27:15.48
can you just go a little bit more back to the book in combat you really see the critical

704
01:27:15.48 --> 01:27:20.60
importance of high morale and a speed of core morale must be high enough to stand the shock

705
01:27:20.60 --> 01:27:26.04
and boredom of combat you know actually before I continue here I want to say this that thing

706
01:27:26.04 --> 01:27:32.60
about giving people heads up about what they're going to face like that you you know you're going

707
01:27:32.60 --> 01:27:40.44
to like if you I've had fighters where they're they got their first big they're on the big stage

708
01:27:40.44 --> 01:27:45.96
maybe they're in the UFC for the first time or whatever they get nervous and they don't know what

709
01:27:45.96 --> 01:27:53.000
that is no one ever told them hey man you're gonna feel you know you're gonna feel sick you're

710
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.44
gonna feel butterflies T do or T is you know Dean used to corner T do a lot and T do and they just

711
01:27:58.44 --> 01:28:05.40
they just had a a show about T do versus Chuck and one of the scenes you can see it's T do

712
01:28:05.40 --> 01:28:11.08
he's right about to walk out and he's throwing up just viciously throwing up and I remember Dean

713
01:28:11.08 --> 01:28:15.32
telling me T do would get so nervous before fights that he would just start throwing up

714
01:28:16.68 --> 01:28:22.04
but he understood what it was now imagine you you just going in your first fight and all the

715
01:28:22.04 --> 01:28:26.28
sudden you start you want to throw up and someone just be like hey just go ahead and throw up

716
01:28:26.28 --> 01:28:31.16
just get it out you know just get it out of your system it's the same thing in combat you

717
01:28:31.16 --> 01:28:35.96
gotta say hey listen you're nervous it's okay if you're jittery if you if you feel sick

718
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:40.84
if you whatever it's okay that's just your body you know focus in its energy towards where

719
01:28:40.84 --> 01:28:46.12
it needs to be focused it's perfectly fine but if you don't know that it can be a problem

720
01:28:48.36 --> 01:28:52.84
back to the book so morale must be high enough to stand the shock and the boredom of combat

721
01:28:52.84 --> 01:28:57.24
every man must be strong must strongly believe that what he is doing is right he must have

722
01:28:57.24 --> 01:29:01.48
supreme confidence that he can deal with any situation that he is a better fighter than the enemy

723
01:29:02.04 --> 01:29:08.04
a spree decor is unit morale every man must feel that his unit is a superb fighting unit and that

724
01:29:08.04 --> 01:29:13.96
he like the rest will sacrifice even life itself for the unit the spirit is often the difference

725
01:29:13.96 --> 01:29:21.32
between mediocre and superior armies it was strong in the robin legions and the French troops

726
01:29:21.32 --> 01:29:29.08
under Napoleon recognize though that the commander must inspire beyond the group a spree

727
01:29:29.08 --> 01:29:35.88
only deep personal conviction springing from the identification with a cause will drive a man forward

728
01:29:35.88 --> 01:29:47.08
when his unit is destroyed or scattered personal example the commander should be a model soldier

729
01:29:47.08 --> 01:29:54.36
he must master the technique of war as it fits his assignment he must improve and expand his

730
01:29:54.36 --> 01:30:00.12
technical knowledge the commander must strive to make it possible for every soldier to say truthfully

731
01:30:00.12 --> 01:30:06.44
the old man knows the old man always knows the right thing to do in addition he must exhibit

732
01:30:06.44 --> 01:30:13.000
daily a fine example of stamina and courage besides his own example the higher commander is also

733
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:20.04
represented by his staff officers they too must reflect the superior qualities of their commander above all

734
01:30:21.96 --> 01:30:24.04
set the proper example

735
01:30:29.64 --> 01:30:37.24
leading by example there you go the model soldier soldiers morale show me a unit that is well run

736
01:30:37.24 --> 01:30:41.32
properly trained and ready for combat and I'll show you a unit with high morale

737
01:30:41.32 --> 01:30:46.28
no commander will readily admit that his units morale is anything other than next

738
01:30:46.28 --> 01:30:50.44
I wrote the leadership strategy in tax people is asking how do I improve do hard things you

739
01:30:50.44 --> 01:30:59.24
unimproven morale do hard things as we compare units however it is often obvious that morale

740
01:30:59.24 --> 01:31:04.52
in some units is more excellent than in others what is morale our manual on leadership defines

741
01:31:04.52 --> 01:31:09.48
morale is the mental and emotional state of the individual although it is a complex and

742
01:31:09.48 --> 01:31:16.52
intangible quality the manifestations of its absence in a unit can be detected readily

743
01:31:16.52 --> 01:31:22.44
in the form of poor appearance of the individuals of the individuals and unit area poor

744
01:31:22.44 --> 01:31:30.12
discipline and a low state of training that's something I mean obviously a high worth immediately

745
01:31:30.12 --> 01:31:35.96
applied that you know to the the hard from the hard luck to the hardcore for Italian and I was

746
01:31:35.96 --> 01:31:40.60
thinking about that with task and bruiser something that we talk about often which is you know

747
01:31:40.60 --> 01:31:46.12
the initially we were working hard than everybody you know people were working hard

748
01:31:46.12 --> 01:31:50.76
than we were preparing for scenarios that we the guys had been to Iraq previously like what

749
01:31:50.76 --> 01:31:55.96
why are we training for this crazy multi-cash little scenario you know that we we didn't experience

750
01:31:55.96 --> 01:31:59.96
anything like that on the on the battlefield or when the instructors say hey you guys are good to go

751
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:03.80
and we said you know what we need to do a few more runs and there was a grumbling around that people

752
01:32:03.80 --> 01:32:07.56
were people were saying hey we're working harder than we know we're coming in early we're

753
01:32:07.56 --> 01:32:11.48
staying late we're not taking the night off and going out drinking beers and town we're actually

754
01:32:11.48 --> 01:32:17.56
planning and training and preparing you know and it's interesting to think about how those

755
01:32:17.56 --> 01:32:23.48
complaints just faded away as our performance increased and I mean that was morale that's that's

756
01:32:23.48 --> 01:32:28.28
morale increasing to say we're tasking a bruiser hey why why are we working harder than you know

757
01:32:28.28 --> 01:32:32.60
these are the taskings because we're tasking a bruiser that's why because we strive to be

758
01:32:32.60 --> 01:32:38.68
better than everybody and that's what we're gonna do and that's that's that's that's a that's awesome

759
01:32:40.04 --> 01:32:51.16
101 more stuff I stole from hack hack with 101 several adjuncts to morale chart three good

760
01:32:51.16 --> 01:32:55.88
management we all like to be in a unit where things run smoothly where things are planned where

761
01:32:55.88 --> 01:33:00.92
men do not have to hurry up and wait adequate information men like to be kept informed ahead of time

762
01:33:00.92 --> 01:33:05.24
of things that affect them or are act to affect them it is far better to for the commander to

763
01:33:05.24 --> 01:33:11.000
keep his men informed that have the men seek to get such information from rumors high state of

764
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.32
training if a unit is not well trained it's men know it this fact shakes their confidence especially

765
01:33:17.32 --> 01:33:23.32
if they anticipate the possibility of using that training in a critical situation chances for advancement

766
01:33:23.32 --> 01:33:29.000
progress is morale raising to all men knowing that advancement is possible and that excellent

767
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.60
performance and preparation lead to promotion helps morale good physical and mental condition

768
01:33:35.32 --> 01:33:40.52
good physical condition goes hand in hand with good mental condition these two elements are basic

769
01:33:40.52 --> 01:33:48.44
to achieving good morale good administration men like to know that they're paying accounts

770
01:33:48.44 --> 01:33:53.24
and individual records are correct confidence and equipment are is the best equipment

771
01:33:53.24 --> 01:34:00.28
best equipment army in the world confidence and commanders men expect their commanders to

772
01:34:00.28 --> 01:34:04.60
know their jobs to share the hardships with them and to take a personal interest in their

773
01:34:04.60 --> 01:34:08.60
problems you will not know whether a particular officer or soldier has a problem until someone has

774
01:34:08.60 --> 01:34:15.72
heard his case a willing ear will gain much confidence comfortable quarters I'm paraphrasing some of

775
01:34:15.72 --> 01:34:22.44
these mess good food mail service medical attention post exchange facilities leaves and passes

776
01:34:22.44 --> 01:34:28.20
religious services and character guidance it is especially important that a army be made up of

777
01:34:28.20 --> 01:34:33.08
mostly young soldiers be provided with facilities for religious services in accordance with their

778
01:34:33.08 --> 01:34:37.56
preferences a program of character guidance will help to continue in the service the whole

779
01:34:37.56 --> 01:34:47.08
some influence of home and community life awards and letters of commendation standards soldiers

780
01:34:47.08 --> 01:34:53.16
like to be in a sharp unit they appreciate achievement of high standards in discipline dress house

781
01:34:53.16 --> 01:34:58.52
keeping police maintenance training and athletics but lifting morale that comes from impressive

782
01:34:58.52 --> 01:35:04.52
and well executed military ceremonies is an important factor that can remind you like

783
01:35:05.72 --> 01:35:11.000
group heaties you know and the team and everyone like hates group heaties like crumbles like

784
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.84
our group group heaties and then you get together and you do some awesome work out together and after

785
01:35:14.84 --> 01:35:20.92
we're like that's awesome that was great you know we just got some little help from external

786
01:35:20.92 --> 01:35:25.40
sources that was we'll move on to this in a second we just got a little some little help from

787
01:35:25.40 --> 01:35:30.36
external sources that it was Ali Frazier when that fight happened when that fight I was talking

788
01:35:30.36 --> 01:35:38.04
about about earlier happened and it was Frazier his Frazier's corner was basically saying

789
01:35:38.04 --> 01:35:45.64
you're done and Ali's was overtelling his corner caught him off I'm done and Frazier's corner said

790
01:35:45.64 --> 01:35:52.44
you can't you you're done and that was it Ali they all these corners you know is no you can't

791
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:57.64
caught I mean you're fighting again you're fighting more and he decided to stick you know that was it

792
01:35:57.64 --> 01:36:05.16
you want for an ex he held on for an extra three seconds and got the victory after our 15 round

793
01:36:05.16 --> 01:36:12.52
war isn't the or a 14 round war going into the 15 round but I like that like what I know

794
01:36:12.52 --> 01:36:18.84
look I know I'm not the most talented and gifted person in any way shape or form but I know that

795
01:36:18.84 --> 01:36:24.76
I if someone's having if I'm having a hard time I know someone else is too and I know that I will answer

796
01:36:24.76 --> 01:36:29.40
the bell and I know that's gonna that's gonna be a problem it's gonna be a problem for somebody

797
01:36:29.40 --> 01:36:35.40
you know that that's I think for a lot of us it's kind of human nature to focus on yourself you know and

798
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:39.88
think oh if you're having a struggle and it's you know it's you something you talk about whether it's

799
01:36:39.88 --> 01:36:45.40
you know this one is for you to waking up you know at the alarm early in the morning and how it's like

800
01:36:45.40 --> 01:36:49.40
you're a human being it's hard for you it's hard for anyone to do that but it's we kind of like to

801
01:36:49.40 --> 01:36:54.92
think oh it's harder for me and without the recognition of like man this is it's hard for

802
01:36:54.92 --> 01:36:59.96
everybody and if I can push a little bit harder it's gonna give me the advantage I figured that out

803
01:36:59.96 --> 01:37:06.44
in hell week for me I wasn't the fastest runner I wasn't a fastest swimmer but like by like day two of

804
01:37:06.44 --> 01:37:12.04
hell week everyone is crushed I was like dude I'm good to go like all of a sudden I can I can

805
01:37:12.04 --> 01:37:16.84
hang with guys that were way faster runners than me you know they were they were hurt more and and

806
01:37:16.84 --> 01:37:22.12
and it's like even the score so I think that's that gives you a pretty huge advantage if you can

807
01:37:22.12 --> 01:37:29.56
keep grinding yeah the tough types you that with that the normal face philosophy for so much

808
01:37:29.56 --> 01:37:33.72
because it jumped like and I'm obviously thinking about like a jujitsu situation or whatever where

809
01:37:33.72 --> 01:37:39.48
you're competing against someone directly where if they're guessing or whatever they're in a state

810
01:37:39.48 --> 01:37:44.68
of extreme adversity we'll say and they interpret because just like how you say in life how you're like hey

811
01:37:44.68 --> 01:37:49.32
we're so focused on ourselves I'm focused on how tired I am I don't know how tired this guy is all

812
01:37:49.32 --> 01:37:54.84
I have really is his external what he's doing or looking like but if the other guy's just like cruising

813
01:37:54.84 --> 01:37:59.48
in his face like he's really comfortable you're like man I can't compete with this at all so now you

814
01:37:59.48 --> 01:38:07.000
want to give up even more you can never like the joke about normal face is no joke man it really isn't

815
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.24
it really truly isn't and you talk about you talk about you know like when how many times have you

816
01:38:13.24 --> 01:38:19.000
seen me like we're doing jujitsu or even not you training with me but me training with anybody me

817
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.40
training with Dean Lish you know training with somebody that's better than me that's given me a run

818
01:38:23.40 --> 01:38:30.76
have you ever seen like a look on my face of just like despair no so and I told this story plot

819
01:38:30.76 --> 01:38:36.20
probably more than once before already on here but there was a time where you were rolling with Dean

820
01:38:36.20 --> 01:38:42.92
and you know with all the respect he was he was kicking your ass pretty bad and I was like dang

821
01:38:42.92 --> 01:38:46.20
I was like he's really in jokbo over and you guys were going hard that's the thing and that's the

822
01:38:46.20 --> 01:38:50.28
part that really like stuck with me I'm like man I would be disgusting right now like hard green

823
01:38:50.28 --> 01:38:54.20
I used scrambled scrambled again you scrambled again you scrambled again and then you kind of

824
01:38:54.20 --> 01:38:58.44
raster it but you guys weren't even doing that I was like man and you're getting your ass kicked

825
01:38:58.44 --> 01:39:02.76
some like jokbo's in a world or hurt right now then he had you in mount double snowing you're

826
01:39:02.76 --> 01:39:07.72
you're gonna like I would be I was feeling literally like physically claustrophobic because of how

827
01:39:07.72 --> 01:39:12.68
tired I was like empathetically getting from watching you guys and like how your arms were

828
01:39:12.68 --> 01:39:17.40
whatever else like man I don't know how he he can even take that or whatever and then you ended

829
01:39:17.40 --> 01:39:21.48
up sort of getting out on the round ended and I was looking at your face and you're just like

830
01:39:21.48 --> 01:39:26.36
kind of like that's what you do every day kind of think that's like I don't know that's what I

831
01:39:26.36 --> 01:39:29.72
knew is like oh okay this could's a little bit different than the normal person you know

832
01:39:30.36 --> 01:39:37.000
you do that even when probably the lowest point that I've seen you when Seth

833
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.20
still and I came to visit you and the hospital after your next surgery and we went bought you a

834
01:39:42.20 --> 01:39:47.08
big like Danny slam burger you know like double cheese burger like we're gonna go let's go see

835
01:39:47.08 --> 01:39:53.32
jokbo you just had a surgery and we roll up there and you were just and you were like normal I

836
01:39:53.32 --> 01:39:58.52
knew you were hurt back as you did like like just set it down over there like you were still

837
01:39:58.52 --> 01:40:02.20
like normal face and I don't know what you looked like before we walked in there but you

838
01:40:02.20 --> 01:40:07.80
definitely turned on normal face when you know and I knew you had to be in mass of pain you just

839
01:40:07.80 --> 01:40:12.60
coming out of neck surgery that you know had all these these nerve issues and they had you on a

840
01:40:12.60 --> 01:40:16.68
bunch of you know just tell but you were even still were normal face well it's freaking get an

841
01:40:16.68 --> 01:40:22.52
ex surgery cousin Dean Lister that's what I mean but it's a real thing and and also I mean look

842
01:40:22.52 --> 01:40:30.12
life you've come to me with many times with all kinds of you know bad bad news you know whether it's

843
01:40:30.12 --> 01:40:33.96
just hey you know whether even it's just something stupid like I'm thinking of some dump stuff like

844
01:40:33.96 --> 01:40:39.16
a you lost some gear right some let's say some critical gear which you did or your

845
01:40:39.16 --> 01:40:44.84
platoon did which means you did like like you know you come to me and you go hey hey boss

846
01:40:46.04 --> 01:40:50.92
we lost this that and the other thing and I go okay well looks like we're gonna have to fill

847
01:40:50.92 --> 01:40:57.80
it to paperwork right like it's a real thing and if I can't control my emotions because you lost

848
01:40:57.80 --> 01:41:02.92
a piece of gear your platoon lost a piece of gear like wow am I gonna react in the future

849
01:41:02.92 --> 01:41:07.000
and by the way when you're saying I lost a piece of gear like we're talking about like I'm

850
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.40
coming and telling you we lost a $15,000 pair of like PBS 15 like night vision which can be used

851
01:41:13.40 --> 01:41:19.40
by the enemy yeah which is a big deal or we lost a a kick 13 which is you know

852
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:28.04
cryptologic device that you know that we use for radios it's a cryptological device that

853
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:33.56
when you lose means the entire country of America has to update their cryptological modes

854
01:41:35.24 --> 01:41:41.000
which is a giant deal and so for Jocco to just give you the normal face on that it's actually

855
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.64
the worst it's like your dad telling you he's he's uh he's not angry he's just disappointed

856
01:41:46.36 --> 01:41:50.44
I mean it's actually the worst because if you were like dude are you kidding me you know like

857
01:41:50.44 --> 01:41:58.52
I would look at it it would be desirable which I was like Roger and just looks back at you like it's

858
01:41:58.52 --> 01:42:03.96
like angry doesn't it give you like a no I maybe it's on the other side of like your brain

859
01:42:03.96 --> 01:42:09.16
or something but doesn't it give you like a big sense of comfort like okay at least this is manageable

860
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:13.56
like it's a big deal but at least it's manageable because like if you're already kind of freaking out

861
01:42:13.56 --> 01:42:20.04
for whatever reason and you bring it to him who's like part of the reason you're kind of apprehensive

862
01:42:20.04 --> 01:42:26.84
about the whole thing to say the least and he doesn't freak out so it's like it feels like in your

863
01:42:26.84 --> 01:42:33.16
mind you're like okay maybe this this whole chaotic situation that just emerged is kind of manageable

864
01:42:34.52 --> 01:42:41.000
well I mean look to me there's there's there's definitely like it's it's it's more difficult

865
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
to handle a boss is like doesn't freak out about it right when you're like because you don't

866
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.16
want to let that boss down yeah you want to let that boss down you're like hey man is like Roger

867
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:56.76
you know and it's it's it's it's it's harder it's more and but I guess to your point

868
01:42:56.76 --> 01:43:00.28
ago it's you're gonna I'm gonna actually fix that problem I want to make sure it doesn't

869
01:43:00.28 --> 01:43:05.08
happen again whether if you do if you flip that about it and you know yelled and screamed to me

870
01:43:05.08 --> 01:43:10.68
then that's my punishment whereas the punishment for me is knowing like it's constructive

871
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:15.16
because I know like I kind of get the specs we can't let this happen again this is a massive issue

872
01:43:15.16 --> 01:43:21.64
hey okay I know we get a send out a message until the entire US military you know department

873
01:43:21.64 --> 01:43:26.76
of defense send out a jackass message yeah so you know what I'm gonna start riding the message right

874
01:43:26.76 --> 01:43:33.24
now let me do it let's get yeah you know that's that's that's probably not the best example I

875
01:43:33.24 --> 01:43:38.68
could have picked because as I'm thinking about it what you're saying is accurate like it's it's

876
01:43:38.68 --> 01:43:44.28
more tormenting for me just to be like all right cool Roger you know as opposed to being like I

877
01:43:44.28 --> 01:43:48.44
can't believe you did that because now you can be like god jack was such a jerk and it's almost

878
01:43:48.44 --> 01:43:57.40
like you know we can have a little spatio as opposed to me just late just saddling you with

879
01:43:57.40 --> 01:44:04.28
unbearable guilt for letting me down but it's it's the reality is it's gets the problem fixed it

880
01:44:04.28 --> 01:44:10.20
gives the problem fixed I mean with it's not unbearable guilt it's like okay we can't let that happen

881
01:44:10.20 --> 01:44:15.72
again this is a huge deal and we gotta get we gotta I'm gonna make sure this doesn't happen again

882
01:44:15.72 --> 01:44:19.40
which is gonna be better for me gonna be better for you gonna be better for our team gonna be better for

883
01:44:19.40 --> 01:44:25.80
everybody rather than like oh okay I got yelled at you know and and that's the end of it you know

884
01:44:25.80 --> 01:44:30.44
yeah and even like when they flip out on you or something you're like yeah I messed up but like

885
01:44:31.40 --> 01:44:36.92
he didn't have to flip out on me like that you know so it kind of like on that justify is what it kind of

886
01:44:36.92 --> 01:44:43.40
let's give you it gives you it gives you a cause right yeah lift lift freaking just lost his mind

887
01:44:43.40 --> 01:44:47.72
with me on that you know what I mean you go back to the platoon you go do jack would just totally

888
01:44:47.72 --> 01:44:52.68
freak out he's freaking out about this that guy turns him out in a moha all the time right

889
01:44:52.68 --> 01:44:57.88
all of a sudden it's me against you and then turns into me against your platoon so it's just all bad

890
01:44:57.88 --> 01:45:02.76
one thing I will say about normal face and I could say this because anybody that knows me knows

891
01:45:02.76 --> 01:45:08.52
that I'm probably the worst one of them yeah the worst normal face guy ever like it is a real

892
01:45:08.52 --> 01:45:17.40
struggle for me to like maintain normal face it's it's funny because I I mean you yes it is not a

893
01:45:17.40 --> 01:45:23.48
strength of yours but you are better now because man back in the day it was just like I would be

894
01:45:23.48 --> 01:45:30.12
looking you're going oh this is my face getting red just clenching your teeth I'd be like oh

895
01:45:30.12 --> 01:45:35.40
jack ladies get spooked up this ought to be good I'd be thinking like please please don't say

896
01:45:35.40 --> 01:45:40.36
anything until the boss leaves or whatever I'll hand it do you know that's the safety thing

897
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.24
and yeah that would be good but what I was gonna say is this is a great example of this when

898
01:45:45.24 --> 01:45:49.08
it goes freedom right and your kids well we know I mean I've known them since they all are

899
01:45:49.08 --> 01:45:55.72
super little and watching growing up and you have helped them you know train them and that like

900
01:45:55.72 --> 01:45:59.80
like help they're you're practicing that and it's something that you got to practice it something you have to

901
01:46:00.36 --> 01:46:05.08
you can get better with reps even if you're not naturally good at it like me you can definitely get better

902
01:46:05.72 --> 01:46:11.08
with with reps and and so I have improved I don't know when it goes still but I think you got to be

903
01:46:11.08 --> 01:46:15.16
thinking about it all the time and that's you know we talked about it on the podcast years ago

904
01:46:15.16 --> 01:46:20.44
when I was here like you're decaying us at home I got young kids at home that's a great example

905
01:46:20.44 --> 01:46:25.24
to like accept that as like a okay I'm not gonna spin up this is a good chance to practice normal

906
01:46:25.24 --> 01:46:30.60
face right now when I'm upset I'm frustrated we're not getting out the door for the road trip

907
01:46:30.60 --> 01:46:35.64
but whatever it is that we all get I get spun up about all the time and it's if you accept that as

908
01:46:35.64 --> 01:46:41.32
like a training opportunity then you're when when you actually need to use normal face you will

909
01:46:41.32 --> 01:46:46.12
actually be much better doing it. You're you mentioned like training and the kids and stuff the

910
01:46:46.12 --> 01:46:53.56
whole reason it's called normal face is because it's an actual game that this guy plays played whatever

911
01:46:53.56 --> 01:46:59.16
with the kids with the it's like a one at the wrapping paper the wrapping paper left over from the

912
01:46:59.16 --> 01:47:07.16
wrapping paper the the tube I've witnessed the normal face you know I did it to one we had a guy

913
01:47:07.16 --> 01:47:12.44
that showed up in Ramadha a new guy who's a great dude when he showed up and he's a happy guy

914
01:47:13.08 --> 01:47:18.68
and he had and he would smile all the time right we're talking private pile you know and so I

915
01:47:18.68 --> 01:47:23.96
look at him go hey you need you can't be walking around like smile like that you're a freaking

916
01:47:23.96 --> 01:47:31.88
team guy you need to represent we we are tasked a bruiser not task unit freaking smiley so

917
01:47:32.52 --> 01:47:36.84
I played normal face with that guy you know what I'm talking about okay yeah and it was so

918
01:47:36.84 --> 01:47:42.60
funny because I mean I was laughing so hard because he could not even come close to not smiling

919
01:47:42.60 --> 01:47:47.000
and the more I did it and the harder I hit him the harder I was laughing he was laughing it was pretty

920
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.76
funny one normal face game I'm thinking about was was your oldest daughter when she was probably

921
01:47:54.76 --> 01:48:00.44
probably seven maybe and we were at your house and on the pull-up bar on the garage do you remember

922
01:48:00.44 --> 01:48:05.32
that no and you're like get up there show life how many pools you can do now she gets up she

923
01:48:05.32 --> 01:48:10.52
cranks out to pull ups like awesome and then you know maybe she wasn't even seven because she was

924
01:48:10.52 --> 01:48:14.76
way off the ground you know you like lifted her up there to get there on the full size pull

925
01:48:14.76 --> 01:48:20.44
up our freaking so she's like four feet off the ground and you're like and you're like I will

926
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:26.28
not catch you as she's hanging on the bar like I will not catch you she's like dad you're like

927
01:48:26.28 --> 01:48:31.56
I mean well you're your hands are like right there but she can't see you and I was just like

928
01:48:32.28 --> 01:48:36.68
and you know what she actually was like you you could see up initially she was like dad and then

929
01:48:36.68 --> 01:48:42.28
then she was like she just went like normal face and then she dropped off your cotter it was like

930
01:48:42.28 --> 01:48:48.92
yeah well you also have to train your kids to deal with just unknown terror

931
01:48:51.72 --> 01:49:01.40
fallie breaking broken bones sorry kids that's the way she turned that out right

932
01:49:01.40 --> 01:49:08.84
okay great she's outstanding yeah I you know it's a learning process you know you learn

933
01:49:08.84 --> 01:49:12.68
about you know you learn about control in your emotions life I've learned a lot about parenting

934
01:49:12.68 --> 01:49:20.36
I feel like with the kids practicing or taking opportunities to practice normal face 100% of the

935
01:49:20.36 --> 01:49:27.56
time is a good method it's a good method and it is a great thing like no joke it is a great thing

936
01:49:27.56 --> 01:49:34.44
for a leader to be able to control your emotions because your emotions we already talked about this

937
01:49:34.44 --> 01:49:39.48
if I'm panicking if lay for a porch to me some news and I panic he's gonna panic every

938
01:49:39.48 --> 01:49:45.40
of the panic it's gonna be mayhem if he sees me go alright got it you know it's like okay

939
01:49:45.40 --> 01:49:51.64
you know I've had like at the master you know the masters uh there's there's timelines and

940
01:49:51.64 --> 01:49:55.64
there's you've got to be at a certain place at a certain time you know and I've had Jamie come up to me you

941
01:49:55.64 --> 01:50:02.04
know the so-and so we don't have any that stuff yet like okay and you can see that she's kind of

942
01:50:02.04 --> 01:50:06.20
panicked about it you know we don't have the labels for the whatever to pass out stuff and I

943
01:50:06.20 --> 01:50:12.20
go okay we'll pass them out tomorrow and she's like okay you know just like it's all good but that

944
01:50:12.20 --> 01:50:15.80
that's an awesome thing man and that's powerful I mean you and I were just talking about this

945
01:50:15.80 --> 01:50:21.16
today right with some some uh with Ashlong front stuff and and uh and our strategic growth and

946
01:50:21.16 --> 01:50:25.88
and things that I was really spinning up about and and really stressing on you're like it's not

947
01:50:25.88 --> 01:50:31.24
that big of a deal you know and that is that's something that is uh that perspective you know

948
01:50:31.24 --> 01:50:37.08
what someone's immersed it or it's someone is immersed in the details of things and they're like

949
01:50:37.08 --> 01:50:40.84
it's the way it's bearing down on them or like man this is gonna happen it's really easy to get

950
01:50:40.84 --> 01:50:46.84
stressed out about that so it's it's a powerful thing man yeah that also you know falls into

951
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:55.56
some implied intent right of me and leaving you with the impression that something needs to be

952
01:50:55.56 --> 01:50:59.32
perfect because well you know me like hey I like things to be squared away and then all of a

953
01:50:59.32 --> 01:51:03.24
sudden you got something that's not squared away and you start trying to fix this problem and

954
01:51:03.24 --> 01:51:09.80
it's you're investing more than it's worth into the problem and it's because I am giving you the wrong

955
01:51:09.80 --> 01:51:14.12
implied intent that hey you know what if it's that much investment I don't want you to make

956
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:19.24
that much investment of time and it's something that's really not gonna have a massive impact strategically

957
01:51:19.24 --> 01:51:26.20
so like I gotta do a better job of going oh you know let me know if something's a struggle

958
01:51:26.20 --> 01:51:33.96
where have I done this before like hey if it's gonna cost this would be really cool to have

959
01:51:33.96 --> 01:51:41.32
it'd be really cool if we executed this but if we can don't worry about it you know don't invest

960
01:51:41.32 --> 01:51:46.52
more than x amount of hours hey go look at it for two hours if we can't do it you know we won't do it

961
01:51:46.52 --> 01:51:53.16
no factor it'd be cool if we can but let's not let's not lose sleep over it whereas you know it's like

962
01:51:53.16 --> 01:52:01.40
once again going back to get his burg what I need to remember is if if generally tell Stonewall

963
01:52:01.40 --> 01:52:06.28
Jackson to do something he's gonna freaking do it and he doesn't care what price he has to pay to

964
01:52:06.28 --> 01:52:10.68
accomplish that mission well if I if I mentioned to you like hey this would be cool to have

965
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:14.68
you're like cool and now the sudden you're paying the ultimate price to finish it makes

966
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:19.96
something happen and you look up you know three weeks later and you've spent money in time

967
01:52:19.96 --> 01:52:26.28
and it's like you know like I got it done or no or maybe we can't execute what your vision was it's like

968
01:52:26.28 --> 01:52:32.60
oh okay cool no worry about it so that's not a good normal face you know it's a little bit too much

969
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:40.04
so yeah it happens the final thing I'll say about normal face is I love that my kids now have been

970
01:52:40.04 --> 01:52:45.56
influenced I'll be like we call it jocconormal face so when you when you say you know we pretty much

971
01:52:45.56 --> 01:52:49.88
brand everything is jockel around here so we're good with that I say execute jockel normal face and they're

972
01:52:49.88 --> 01:52:56.52
like these smiling for a picture that I boom it's on cue it's awesome I won't you're old not so much

973
01:52:56.52 --> 01:53:03.96
yet but my four year old six year old they get so that's legit that's legit all right back to the book

974
01:53:05.40 --> 01:53:10.52
chart number four evidence of we're on this whole thing talking about morale and this is evidence

975
01:53:10.52 --> 01:53:15.88
of morale and discussing the subject of morale with visitors I often ask and am asked what do you

976
01:53:15.88 --> 01:53:22.36
look for in a unit or in order to gauge the morale since morale is influenced by so many factors

977
01:53:22.92 --> 01:53:28.20
there are naturally many indications of the state of morale the things I know quickly and sizing

978
01:53:28.20 --> 01:53:35.56
up a unit include I'm gonna burn through some of these saluting dress good house keeping pride

979
01:53:35.56 --> 01:53:40.84
pride I'll go into that one a little bit are the men eager to show their accomplishments do they

980
01:53:40.84 --> 01:53:46.28
point to their units history with pride do they have something good to sell and try and sell it

981
01:53:48.52 --> 01:53:53.56
participating in charities athletic program and support teams and athletic program enthusiastically

982
01:53:53.56 --> 01:54:00.60
supporters always a favorable indication of morale church attendance soldiers deposits and other

983
01:54:00.60 --> 01:54:07.08
savings a man who saves his money each month is banking on his future and his wellage it is usually

984
01:54:07.08 --> 01:54:12.92
a well adjusted and confident soldier when there are many such soldiers in a unit there is a depth

985
01:54:12.92 --> 01:54:18.36
of stability in the organization but commanders should not attempt to coerce the men to participate in this

986
01:54:18.36 --> 01:54:25.72
program you know just for for for all leaders really this is probably one of the things when I look

987
01:54:25.72 --> 01:54:34.20
back at my military career that I did a pretty horrible job of and that was that I never said all

988
01:54:34.20 --> 01:54:39.32
guys here's what you should do with your money here's some here's some moves to make you know

989
01:54:40.12 --> 01:54:43.48
here's some things that you should do here some things that you shouldn't do so just if you're a

990
01:54:43.48 --> 01:54:48.36
leader especially if you're a military leader look when you're a militant a lot of kids that

991
01:54:48.36 --> 01:54:54.92
joined the military myself included hey when I got to the teams and I was an E4 in the teams I was

992
01:54:54.92 --> 01:55:02.04
the richest person in the world and you know I got that paycheck every two weeks and I was ready to rock

993
01:55:02.04 --> 01:55:09.64
and roll make it right it was great and you know I really wish somebody along the way would have said

994
01:55:09.64 --> 01:55:16.92
hey man that's cool you know you're gonna make whatever $5,000 this month you know what I know you

995
01:55:16.92 --> 01:55:22.60
like to get after it and go have a good time and you should and you should do that with $4,000 not

996
01:55:22.60 --> 01:55:32.84
with $4,999 so if you're in a position where you can help people plan their economic future please do that

997
01:55:32.84 --> 01:55:38.84
you know what it's funny that you're actually saying that because you of all the people I worked with

998
01:55:38.84 --> 01:55:44.52
in 13 years in the Navy like you're the only one that did that and maybe not on like a

999
01:55:46.36 --> 01:55:50.92
you didn't like have a presentation to the entire task unit you know maybe you could have done

1000
01:55:50.92 --> 01:55:56.12
something absolutely should have but you had a lot of direct interaction with a whole lot of people

1001
01:55:56.12 --> 01:56:01.24
and helped direct them you know our influence or our encourage of the do something you know

1002
01:56:01.96 --> 01:56:06.12
go in the right way yeah I think to your point I think guys that were close to me

1003
01:56:06.12 --> 01:56:11.000
I would be like hey bro what you need to do is this and so that's cool but you know I should have

1004
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.16
been doing it for everybody and I didn't and the reason is I didn't really care about that stuff

1005
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:21.64
honestly I didn't really think about it I didn't really think about that I just thought about

1006
01:56:21.64 --> 01:56:25.96
hey we we just want to be good frogmen and a good task unit and good platoon you know like that's it

1007
01:56:25.96 --> 01:56:31.72
so we're here for so I should have been thinking a little bit deeper about that but if you're in that position

1008
01:56:33.08 --> 01:56:42.04
do it enlistment and re-enlistment records a wall when such offenses are reasonably easy to commit

1009
01:56:42.04 --> 01:56:48.36
and the number of offenses is low it is indicative of high morale sizes sit call court

1010
01:56:48.36 --> 01:56:55.80
martial rates incidents and accidents complaints about the inspector general this is another

1011
01:56:55.80 --> 01:57:01.88
classic thing right so complaints to the inspector general sorry this is in complaints to the

1012
01:57:01.88 --> 01:57:07.32
inspector general later in the book lady talks about how you should be open and ready to being

1013
01:57:07.32 --> 01:57:13.32
inspected when if you everyone's hates inspections and doesn't want the commander to come down

1014
01:57:13.32 --> 01:57:19.64
and he says you should be waiting for that and it's very similar to our attitude and Ramadi which

1015
01:57:20.28 --> 01:57:28.28
which I absolutely stole from the exo of the first the 506 or sorry yeah the exo the first the five

1016
01:57:28.28 --> 01:57:33.96
well the ops officer from the first the 506 who as soon as we got there there's an investigation

1017
01:57:33.96 --> 01:57:37.72
happening and he and I was like yeah what you can investigate before he goes oh this that and the other thing

1018
01:57:37.72 --> 01:57:44.68
and or this thing and I said oh this is that how's that gonna work out he goes I love it when we get

1019
01:57:44.68 --> 01:57:50.84
inspected because I want them to come in inspect and see what we're doing and see what it's like down here

1020
01:57:50.84 --> 01:57:54.76
and see what it's like to live down here and let them understand what's going on in the front lines

1021
01:57:54.76 --> 01:58:03.24
and I absolutely adopted that policy and what's cool is what he says in this book is you know

1022
01:58:04.52 --> 01:58:09.16
why are you afraid of being inspected you shouldn't have nothing to hide so if you're if you're

1023
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:14.20
afraid of being inspected that's a problem and let's fix the thing so that you could be

1024
01:58:15.56 --> 01:58:19.48
open to being inspected you know we we talked about that in extro membership right leading up

1025
01:58:19.48 --> 01:58:24.84
the chenic command and how we invited our commander to come down and see what we're doing and

1026
01:58:24.84 --> 01:58:29.80
and invite our operations officer and the there staff to be there but that's it's a complete opposite

1027
01:58:29.80 --> 01:58:34.76
though of what everybody else oh yeah everybody else's mindset was like get the boss man away

1028
01:58:34.76 --> 01:58:40.04
we don't want them around here we want to be able to and what they wanted to be able to get away with

1029
01:58:40.04 --> 01:58:46.52
was like really minuscule stuff like uniforms around the camp like attendance at meetings a little

1030
01:58:46.52 --> 01:58:51.80
things that don't really matter and and yet what we gained by having them come out and visit us was

1031
01:58:53.24 --> 01:58:57.56
a deep understanding of our mission how we were mitigating risk what resources we needed

1032
01:58:58.12 --> 01:59:02.76
I mean it's it's it's a no brainer and yet nobody does that because they don't want the

1033
01:59:02.76 --> 01:59:10.04
the scooby of the big boss man the wrong attitude next section outside influence on morale

1034
01:59:10.04 --> 01:59:16.12
the factors and indications of morale covered so far concern things generally within the control

1035
01:59:16.12 --> 01:59:21.88
of the commander but there are influences on the morale of the soldiers especially those on duty

1036
01:59:21.88 --> 01:59:27.48
in a far off land which stem from apt attitudes of officials the press radio commentators

1037
01:59:27.48 --> 01:59:34.12
and public at home the soldier should feel that he is needed and that his sacrifices are the

1038
01:59:34.12 --> 01:59:40.28
of immediate and long range benefit to his country his home his family and himself he should

1039
01:59:40.28 --> 01:59:46.12
feel that his unit is in is as important to him as his family that he is just as important to the

1040
01:59:46.12 --> 01:59:52.68
unit he will feel that importance as long as the people at home feel that he is sensitive to

1041
01:59:52.68 --> 02:00:00.04
public opinion at home and because of good radio newspaper and male facilities is constantly

1042
02:00:00.04 --> 02:00:06.04
aware of attitudes at the home toward the importance of his job that's an interesting perspective

1043
02:00:06.04 --> 02:00:12.36
compared to totally all enough if we were reading newspapers and watching TV you know the

1044
02:00:12.36 --> 02:00:17.96
particular 2006 the rack war it was just constant negative coverage quagmire we can't win

1045
02:00:18.60 --> 02:00:26.20
you know this is terrible we just had a tune that stuff out yeah and it's it's even more pronounced

1046
02:00:26.20 --> 02:00:33.48
now with social media do we have social media was there social media for us in in remodels like

1047
02:00:33.48 --> 02:00:37.96
my space and actually I do remember markly used to always come back and get on Facebook

1048
02:00:37.96 --> 02:00:44.44
and it existed yeah Facebook existed but it was not I think it like my space was still like the

1049
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:49.48
dominant uh 2006 echo where were we at social media wise 2006?

1050
02:00:49.48 --> 02:00:55.000
his correct yes just kicking it with my space between my space and my space was like a music

1051
02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:01.32
something yeah you could put me so so so my space was legit social media back that yes

1052
02:01:01.32 --> 02:01:08.76
and before that yeah 2007 2006 what you did what you did Facebook come to prominence

1053
02:01:08.76 --> 02:01:14.84
I don't know the exact year but that's when you know when it was it was rolling

1054
02:01:14.84 --> 02:01:19.64
it was for sure but my space was still going on as well but there was a lot less people on all

1055
02:01:19.64 --> 02:01:25.80
these things you know yeah I mean now it's now it's the now it it has replaced me pre-eyefall

1056
02:01:25.80 --> 02:01:30.92
so you could access it with your phone you know access it through the you know your computer

1057
02:01:30.92 --> 02:01:37.72
yeah that was like barely like right when pictures to the internet started going

1058
02:01:38.76 --> 02:01:44.92
like not all phone dead cameras so bottom line we got to pay attention the influence on

1059
02:01:44.92 --> 02:01:53.56
morale from outside our organization pay attention to it this next section is called junior officers

1060
02:01:53.56 --> 02:01:59.56
conferences and and it says there are always many newly commissioned officers find officers in the

1061
02:01:59.56 --> 02:02:03.40
army they have come from many sources some of these young officers have demonstrated

1062
02:02:03.40 --> 02:02:07.40
outstanding ability and combat others have not had this experience few of them have had

1063
02:02:07.40 --> 02:02:11.96
the time or opportunity become fully indoctrinated with the duties and responsibilities required

1064
02:02:11.96 --> 02:02:17.88
of an officer the standards and responsibilities of an officer are in many respects more

1065
02:02:17.88 --> 02:02:23.64
exacting and more difficult to discharge in peace time than in combat consequently officers

1066
02:02:23.64 --> 02:02:27.64
conferences should be conducted for all junior officers to review the duties and response

1067
02:02:27.64 --> 02:02:31.80
response so what do you say is that look you should meet with your your

1068
02:02:32.84 --> 02:02:39.80
subordinate leadership and educate them and teach them and I often ask this question to clients

1069
02:02:43.24 --> 02:02:51.88
I say as anyone here had a person that invested in them personally and you know most of the time

1070
02:02:51.88 --> 02:02:58.44
especially when I'm talking to leaders most of the time people will raise their hand and say you

1071
02:02:58.44 --> 02:03:03.24
know oh yeah you know I've had this person that took me under the wing or and I and I

1072
02:03:03.24 --> 02:03:08.68
would then I say well how does that how did that make you feel and obviously everyone says oh yeah

1073
02:03:08.68 --> 02:03:12.12
that makes you feel great make you feel like you can do well and it's person that's encouraging you

1074
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.52
and then I say how many people are you doing that for right now and like there's less hands right

1075
02:03:18.52 --> 02:03:23.32
and so we take this investment of the people that raised you like the people that raised me and the

1076
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:27.80
teams right what if I take that investment I just hold on to it don't give it anybody else that's horrible

1077
02:03:27.80 --> 02:03:34.44
and it's not continuing to grow the capabilities of the community there's there's there's something

1078
02:03:34.44 --> 02:03:40.04
deeper there that I when he he said rolls and responsibility so you were viewing rolls and

1079
02:03:40.04 --> 02:03:44.60
responsibilities with them and I think that's something that you know the jocco brief that you would

1080
02:03:44.60 --> 02:03:49.24
give in like the junior officer training course when I was running training for two years I ran

1081
02:03:49.24 --> 02:03:53.80
training for all seal officers are graduating from our our basic training pipeline and you came

1082
02:03:53.80 --> 02:03:57.88
in we'd have you come in and give the jocco brief and it was the same thing that you briefed to

1083
02:03:58.92 --> 02:04:03.16
the task units and impultines going through the work up and I think one of the most important parts

1084
02:04:03.16 --> 02:04:07.72
of that was the rules and responsibilities so it's great to mentor I mean you write people

1085
02:04:07.72 --> 02:04:12.12
don't invest in their people I agree with that 100% but I think a lot of people don't know how to

1086
02:04:12.12 --> 02:04:17.48
mentor people and what he's saying there I think which is if you've got to make their roles

1087
02:04:17.48 --> 02:04:23.96
and responsibilities clear and you broke down I mean it was it was it was shooter you know your job

1088
02:04:23.96 --> 02:04:28.68
is to make things happen you know get default of the grass you have you haven't listed out

1089
02:04:28.68 --> 02:04:33.24
all the way fire team leader you know take your four guys lead your fire team support your squad leader

1090
02:04:33.24 --> 02:04:37.48
you had the squad leader then you had the butoon commanders you had the assault chief you had the

1091
02:04:37.48 --> 02:04:43.16
you know assault force commander the ground force commander etc and that was a really powerful

1092
02:04:43.16 --> 02:04:51.40
document so much so that I've had several several very successful seals including good friends

1093
02:04:51.40 --> 02:04:56.28
of years who have reached out to me and said hey can we get a copy of that yeah yeah yeah yeah

1094
02:04:56.28 --> 02:05:01.56
because it really it without breaking that down enables you to execute with confidence if you

1095
02:05:01.56 --> 02:05:05.32
know what your roles or responsibilities are then you can actually step up and execute with confidence

1096
02:05:05.32 --> 02:05:11.40
and I think that's a really people don't define that though you define it away it was easy to

1097
02:05:11.40 --> 02:05:17.64
understand and enable people to execute and I think that's a great that's a key thing to mentor people

1098
02:05:17.64 --> 02:05:22.52
on one of the key parts of that when I would get done talking about what the roles and responsibilities

1099
02:05:22.52 --> 02:05:27.24
of everyone was I would say okay now that you know your roles and responsibility you also have to

1100
02:05:27.24 --> 02:05:30.84
understand the person below you and the person above you are the chain of command you have to

1101
02:05:30.84 --> 02:05:36.04
understand what their roles and responsibilities are and if you have to you have to either ascend

1102
02:05:36.04 --> 02:05:40.84
or descend into the situation where you can solve a problem do their job as soon as you get a

1103
02:05:40.84 --> 02:05:45.48
problem solved you can't get stuck there you have to elevate yourself up to the next position

1104
02:05:45.48 --> 02:05:51.40
the last thing that I would start saying to guys once they were done with jazzy now I'm talking

1105
02:05:51.40 --> 02:05:58.12
up to tunes is I would say listen and I would usually say this just to like the headshed I would say

1106
02:05:58.12 --> 02:06:05.56
listen here's the roles and responsibilities I don't actually care who does these things but you

1107
02:06:05.56 --> 02:06:13.80
better figure it out because sometimes you might have a platoon chief that hadn't been in the

1108
02:06:13.80 --> 02:06:18.52
teams for a few years and he had some platoon commander that had just gotten back off deployment

1109
02:06:18.52 --> 02:06:24.52
or you'd have whatever the case may be maybe the LPO just got done teaching assaults out at

1110
02:06:24.52 --> 02:06:29.16
trade at and now he's in the platoon or just got back from land war for so he's going to really

1111
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:35.88
know how to do that job so I'd say listen it doesn't really matter which one you have now I'll tell

1112
02:06:35.88 --> 02:06:41.80
you basically and this is what I always say basically in listed guys you're the tactical experts

1113
02:06:41.80 --> 02:06:47.24
you handle the problem that you got at hand officers you need to figure out what the next move is

1114
02:06:47.24 --> 02:06:55.16
going to be and that was the general thing but then I'd say listen if this officer like doesn't have

1115
02:06:55.16 --> 02:07:01.16
any experience whatsoever and maybe the LPO is kind of badass and the chief is I'd say listen listen

1116
02:07:01.16 --> 02:07:06.44
officer you need to look to your chief and he needs to elevate a little bit and figure out what's

1117
02:07:06.44 --> 02:07:13.56
going to do next so and that well the reason that happened was because as I put more and more

1118
02:07:13.56 --> 02:07:18.76
platoons through training I saw that some platoons they just didn't they would they had a mismatch

1119
02:07:18.76 --> 02:07:24.20
they had some prior and listed officer that was freaking just a badass new everything or they had

1120
02:07:24.20 --> 02:07:30.92
a a chief that was you know been out of the loop for a while and so okay but the LPO like I said

1121
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:36.52
so eventually I would say listen I don't really care how you guys break these up but you have to

1122
02:07:36.52 --> 02:07:43.16
know who's responsible for what and one man cannot do all these jobs it's it's not possible for one

1123
02:07:43.16 --> 02:07:48.44
man to do all these jobs I seen some badass seals with tons of experience come through here and

1124
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:53.08
they might be able to pull it off for on offer two ops and then something's going to happen and all

1125
02:07:53.08 --> 02:07:56.04
of a sudden it's going to be overwhelmed and other people have to be able to back them up not

1126
02:07:56.04 --> 02:08:00.52
to mention if somebody's doing all these jobs I'm going to kill him and you better figure it out

1127
02:08:01.64 --> 02:08:05.80
I remember that don't get stuck there in your house so it's stuck there

1128
02:08:05.80 --> 02:08:13.56
there so I okay so the reason I wanted to cover this section is because it says this so we're talking

1129
02:08:13.56 --> 02:08:19.40
about these junior officer conferences these conferences should be conducted by commanders themselves

1130
02:08:19.40 --> 02:08:24.68
and on an informal basis lieutenant and separate companies and attachments may be invited to

1131
02:08:24.68 --> 02:08:28.92
join groups from units commanded by a field great officer groups should not be too large

1132
02:08:29.80 --> 02:08:34.44
preaching should be avoided I read this whole section just so I could say that preaching should be

1133
02:08:34.44 --> 02:08:39.96
avoided these conferences can well can well be the means of improving the unit team

1134
02:08:40.68 --> 02:08:45.32
under the coaching of its captain the unit commander these conferences may consist of one hour

1135
02:08:45.32 --> 02:08:50.20
meetings he goes he goes into some detail about how to do it but the fact that he's saying look

1136
02:08:50.20 --> 02:08:55.000
you're not bringing people in there to preach on how to do things you're bringing in their

1137
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
educate to have discussions and he's got the whole topic of discussions here military courtesy

1138
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:08.28
personal standards military discipline promotions unit history a speed of core accomplishments missions

1139
02:09:09.48 --> 02:09:14.04
troop information morale self education of officers professional publications

1140
02:09:14.84 --> 02:09:20.52
responsibility for fun he's got everything security classification use a misuse of military vehicles

1141
02:09:20.52 --> 02:09:27.08
so basically it's like tell the guys what's going on that's what he's saying you have to tell

1142
02:09:27.08 --> 02:09:34.92
people what's going on and then he's got this commander's checklist for success and this

1143
02:09:34.92 --> 02:09:38.12
we've already been going for a while so this will probably be the last thing we cover

1144
02:09:40.20 --> 02:09:46.04
every commander at every echelon should maintain a continuing checklist to be left for or given

1145
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:54.44
to his successor to command this checklist should contain items of value that will assist the new commander

1146
02:09:54.44 --> 02:10:00.12
in becoming familiar with his command more rapidly than if he had had to uncover the same

1147
02:10:00.12 --> 02:10:05.80
items over a period of time such items must consist of one significant strengths and weaknesses

1148
02:10:05.80 --> 02:10:13.16
of key officers and non-commission officers in the command boom isn't it weird that we might be in

1149
02:10:13.16 --> 02:10:19.72
charge of people and know that we would have to turn this over and not keep track of like who's

1150
02:10:19.72 --> 02:10:25.32
what strengthen weaknesses are next important policy matters announced by senior commanders and

1151
02:10:25.32 --> 02:10:31.48
not contained in SOP or directives so you're tracking this stuff a good turnover is such an

1152
02:10:31.48 --> 02:10:38.44
important thing to to do and what I think is important about a turnover it's great to have it

1153
02:10:38.44 --> 02:10:44.20
to turn over to the next unit but what it does is it forces you to actually think through

1154
02:10:44.20 --> 02:10:49.96
how you are operating and when you force yourself to think through how you're operating you

1155
02:10:50.84 --> 02:10:58.76
define it you refine it you codify it and now it becomes stronger just like when you

1156
02:10:59.56 --> 02:11:04.04
just like when you write down these principles just like when you formulate a standard operating

1157
02:11:04.04 --> 02:11:08.52
procedure and you just like when you teach a jiu-jitsu move or you write out how you do any time that

1158
02:11:08.52 --> 02:11:13.96
you study what you're doing you will get better at it and that's what this commanders check list

1159
02:11:13.96 --> 02:11:18.68
for successors I said successors it's for successors for someone that's going to take your place

1160
02:11:20.28 --> 02:11:24.12
that you know what part of that too I think is yeah that's self analysis you're talking about

1161
02:11:24.12 --> 02:11:29.08
is like hey what do we screw up what do we learn from it I remember given a turnover one time

1162
02:11:30.28 --> 02:11:36.04
on a follow on deployment and and when the new unit came in the new seal seal unit taken over for

1163
02:11:36.04 --> 02:11:40.84
for us and one of the one of the senior leaders was like this is a great turnover you guys are

1164
02:11:40.84 --> 02:11:46.04
given here I really this is one of the best tours I've ever seen I'm like why did you say that

1165
02:11:46.04 --> 02:11:50.12
I did kind of caught me off guard I was like what what do you say that he's like because you're telling

1166
02:11:50.12 --> 02:11:55.64
us all the stuff that you screwed up and it was it's really you know when you have a unit turning

1167
02:11:55.64 --> 02:12:00.52
over thing like people coming in like get these idiots out of here we're going to take take over

1168
02:12:00.52 --> 02:12:05.40
even though we've been there for six months learning and I was like man how are you going to

1169
02:12:05.40 --> 02:12:09.80
learn from us to continue the mission to be more effective if we don't tell you what we screwed up

1170
02:12:09.80 --> 02:12:14.60
but clearly he wasn't used to that and most people weren't doing that and I think that

1171
02:12:14.60 --> 02:12:19.08
taking deeply about it and if you care about the mission then you want you want the people it

1172
02:12:19.08 --> 02:12:23.40
is successful I mean we tried to set up the next seal team for sure you know Steve Ward and his

1173
02:12:23.40 --> 02:12:31.72
guys sir yeah yeah speaking of Steve Ward you can be coming on the podcast sometime real soon

1174
02:12:33.64 --> 02:12:37.72
names and personalities of individuals outside the command with whom it is necessary to associate

1175
02:12:37.72 --> 02:12:42.44
new business areas of training weaknesses within the command so reporting the weaknesses like you

1176
02:12:42.44 --> 02:12:47.72
just talked about disciplinary matters security matters critical equipment shortages so that's

1177
02:12:47.72 --> 02:12:57.72
that's that section and here's the last thing we'll cover vigilance and by the way we're we are on

1178
02:12:57.72 --> 02:13:06.04
page 13 right now so yeah we are on page 13 of this book there's 117 pages

1179
02:13:06.04 --> 02:13:14.92
when I'm page 13 a unit operational readiness status must be ready for immediate employment at

1180
02:13:14.92 --> 02:13:22.52
all times regardless of how well a unit has been trained the commander cannot allow it to become

1181
02:13:22.52 --> 02:13:28.76
wax and let down its guard World War II and the Korean conflict were started by surprise attacks

1182
02:13:28.76 --> 02:13:36.44
on Sunday mornings these surprises remind us that we must be ready for anything seven days a week

1183
02:13:36.44 --> 02:13:47.32
24 hours a day we cannot relax our vigilance in any way that would contribute to disaster

1184
02:13:47.32 --> 02:14:01.08
so there you go like I said that is the first 13 pages I'm only two thirds of the way through

1185
02:14:01.08 --> 02:14:08.12
my second just get our help sniper just get it up look I'll get to the rest of this I'm sure

1186
02:14:08.12 --> 02:14:15.40
I'll cover this thing but it's just incredible to see how these principles remain the same

1187
02:14:15.40 --> 02:14:25.48
over time and it's so intriguing to uncover the roots of hack worth and about face and thereby

1188
02:14:25.48 --> 02:14:31.40
the roots of me and of you and of extreme ownership and the Academy of Leadership and Leadership

1189
02:14:31.40 --> 02:14:38.76
Strategy and Tactics there's a thread you can trace through all these books you got to know your

1190
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:46.60
roots and the better the better you understand yes history but the better you understand the origin of

1191
02:14:46.60 --> 02:14:54.44
ideas and principles then the better you understand those ideas and principles themselves

1192
02:14:56.12 --> 02:15:03.80
and the better leader and person you will become crazy

1193
02:15:03.80 --> 02:15:11.40
what do you think life I think that's outstanding I think that's incredibly eye-opening and

1194
02:15:12.68 --> 02:15:19.08
it's because I've read about face and detail and you know I've just flipped it through my copy

1195
02:15:19.08 --> 02:15:25.24
this week as I was kind of organized myself in my home office and looking at just the you know

1196
02:15:25.24 --> 02:15:31.48
the tab and underlying pages and I actually had to I put packing tape along the binder because

1197
02:15:31.48 --> 02:15:38.20
it's been so just it's been so from over use it's just been torn up and I had to reinforce it

1198
02:15:39.24 --> 02:15:46.52
it's awesome to to understand where Colonel Hackworth got some of these ideas and and look I'm sure

1199
02:15:47.40 --> 02:15:54.12
you know I'm sure also you know that these were learned from from mentors you know and from generations

1200
02:15:54.12 --> 02:16:03.16
as well but incredible stuff definitely making us better yeah I'll tell you

1201
02:16:03.16 --> 02:16:10.28
speaking of getting better you you have any maybe I don't know suggestions on how we can get

1202
02:16:10.28 --> 02:16:15.88
you now that you mention it actually I think that's the interesting you're that book

1203
02:16:16.68 --> 02:16:21.40
that you finally located it was like a little treasure hunt you know the kind guys who like

1204
02:16:21.40 --> 02:16:26.12
they look for treasure that might not even exist you know that can go that that was you

1205
02:16:26.12 --> 02:16:31.24
she's like oh it doesn't exist seems saying you only got hints of it through Hackworth

1206
02:16:31.24 --> 02:16:38.04
I have I have access to all kinds of like I pay you know these various websites that offer

1207
02:16:38.04 --> 02:16:43.16
all these ancient PDFs I mean I got the most the the dumbest subscriptions and I've

1208
02:16:43.16 --> 02:16:49.16
spent scouring these things for years you know nothing not it and how crazy is it

1209
02:16:49.16 --> 02:16:55.32
that the month that this version of about face comes out I freaking find this thing there's

1210
02:16:55.32 --> 02:17:04.04
one copy of what on Amazon and I have it it was meant to be I have it it's legit juggle gutties treasure

1211
02:17:04.04 --> 02:17:11.40
I have the ARC which is the advanced readers copy so that's so an advanced readers kind no I

1212
02:17:11.40 --> 02:17:15.64
don't have it of that book but an advanced readers copy when a when a book is gonna come out

1213
02:17:15.64 --> 02:17:23.96
they release they'll print like they'll print how many how many ARCs do you think they print in current days

1214
02:17:25.96 --> 02:17:31.40
I have no idea 100 well 2000 no no advanced reader copies what are they call the galley's

1215
02:17:32.20 --> 02:17:37.000
I'm sorry yeah I'm gonna you think they print like for instance for a whole first stream

1216
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.48
ownership I think I got six and you got six yeah like that and then they printed this home to send to whoever

1217
02:17:43.48 --> 02:17:49.88
but we're talking absolutely doesn't yeah absolutely less than 50 right less than 50

1218
02:17:50.92 --> 02:17:56.12
so we're at the master in a guy named Tobin came up and he goes I have something for you and he

1219
02:17:56.12 --> 02:18:01.48
gives me like a brown paper bag and this is just weird because it's hard even understand this

1220
02:18:01.48 --> 02:18:07.40
it's if you don't understand what an ARC is and I understand how rare they are that you know look you

1221
02:18:07.40 --> 02:18:12.04
get like I love first edition like I love first edition about face but there's got to be a 100

1222
02:18:12.04 --> 02:18:17.64
thousand of those things floating around right you know you might like the first edition of

1223
02:18:17.64 --> 02:18:22.68
extreme ownership you know we always joke about it but there's hundreds of thousands of copies

1224
02:18:23.48 --> 02:18:32.92
of the first edition of extreme ownership there's only probably less than 50 ARCs of extreme ownership

1225
02:18:33.72 --> 02:18:39.88
and same with the rest of all of our books well so I'm at the master and this guy comes up to me

1226
02:18:39.88 --> 02:18:43.000
and he goes yeah I wanted to give you something and I all awesome appreciate it and people

1227
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:48.28
give us a lot of cool stuff all the time you know and he hands me this paper bag and I open it up

1228
02:18:48.28 --> 02:18:52.92
and there's a plastic but there's a book in plastic just a plastic bag I pull it out and I look at it

1229
02:18:52.92 --> 02:18:58.60
and it's an version of about face that I've never seen before and it's thinner than normal and I go

1230
02:18:59.80 --> 02:19:06.68
what is this and I pull it out of the plastic and sure enough it's an unedited advanced

1231
02:19:06.68 --> 02:19:19.24
to readers copy of about face signed by David Aquarth this thing is priceless to me right so

1232
02:19:20.12 --> 02:19:26.68
he's out there I actually owe him copies of about face of this new version but guess what I'll

1233
02:19:26.68 --> 02:19:38.20
some sending him a RCs of extreme ownership because they gave us about six each I have all of mine

1234
02:19:38.20 --> 02:19:42.20
I have mine as well you want to know why why do you have yours why did you keep yours

1235
02:19:45.16 --> 02:19:49.40
I think I some of my intended to send to people and they didn't get sent and some of my just

1236
02:19:49.40 --> 02:19:54.20
thought be kind of cool to get hang on to you know I only kept I first of all I didn't know that it was a

1237
02:19:54.20 --> 02:19:58.76
big deal I didn't know that this is this whole thing you know we didn't know if the hell we are doing

1238
02:19:58.76 --> 02:20:03.08
when it came to writing so we didn't know if the hell we were doing so they send us these things

1239
02:20:03.08 --> 02:20:07.000
and I'm like yeah whatever well I didn't they're like you could send them to you know the

1240
02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:14.52
influencers that you know yeah well I'm like and so what I'm thinking is there's misspellings in this

1241
02:20:14.52 --> 02:20:18.92
there's some things that we edited out I said I don't want anyone to see this and I just put them right

1242
02:20:18.92 --> 02:20:26.68
my I put them in you know in like a drawer somewhere and then I don't know a few years later

1243
02:20:26.68 --> 02:20:34.12
I started as I actually as we started doing the podcast and I started getting more into getting

1244
02:20:34.12 --> 02:20:39.16
various books and I always liked the first edition thing but then I realized at some point that

1245
02:20:39.16 --> 02:20:45.88
there was something better than the first edition and that was the readers ARC I got I guess

1246
02:20:45.88 --> 02:20:52.92
something better than the readers ARC and that is the the word document manuscript oh yeah

1247
02:20:53.56 --> 02:20:58.04
which we got we've got the edit all the edits like just the crazy edits that we went through

1248
02:20:58.60 --> 02:21:02.92
well that was crazy too because you were you were you knew yeah you were in New York when we wrote

1249
02:21:02.92 --> 02:21:08.44
extreme ownership and we had to edit that thing and I remember spending four hours on the phone

1250
02:21:08.44 --> 02:21:14.04
going through final edits would be like art pages page 64 hey you're said that's what you think and

1251
02:21:14.04 --> 02:21:18.04
you'd be like oh yeah we knew you know we said we would just sit there and manually go through

1252
02:21:18.84 --> 02:21:25.40
for hours on the phone these stupid edits you know and what's what's interesting isn't we

1253
02:21:25.40 --> 02:21:29.56
were talking about this the other day there was one of the last edits that we did we kind of got

1254
02:21:29.56 --> 02:21:35.64
out the freaking the clenched fist of editing and just started cutting stuff you know we started

1255
02:21:35.64 --> 02:21:41.16
getting rid of stuff that was pretty that was pretty cool you know it'll be interesting to see

1256
02:21:41.16 --> 02:21:45.32
you know I think particularly if you think about decades from now what that might be like I

1257
02:21:45.32 --> 02:21:50.28
a friend of mine showed me you know obviously that stuff becomes quite valuable to collectors

1258
02:21:50.28 --> 02:21:55.80
and people that know you know it's meaningful to people that it has the understand the value

1259
02:21:55.80 --> 02:22:02.44
of what it is and how rare it is and a friend of mine showed me a copy of it was a biography of Stonewall Jackson

1260
02:22:03.40 --> 02:22:07.16
and he was like he handed it to me it was kind of his old and kind of brittle I felt like

1261
02:22:07.16 --> 02:22:13.72
it was going to fall apart open up and it's this G-Patten it was it was Patton's personal copy

1262
02:22:13.72 --> 02:22:19.72
totally annotated like noted like all the notes in the margins you know something that general

1263
02:22:19.72 --> 02:22:24.84
pattern went through and and note it was pretty pretty awesome that is awesome I have all the

1264
02:22:24.84 --> 02:22:30.12
books that I've covered in the podcast with all the tabs and notes and red lines and highlights

1265
02:22:30.12 --> 02:22:35.40
and everything and it's freaking cool to sit there and go back because I'll go back and look at

1266
02:22:35.40 --> 02:22:40.60
a book that I you know I had to cover on the podcast and like I didn't even come close to getting

1267
02:22:40.60 --> 02:22:46.20
like out everything out of this that I need to get out of this you know with the old breed especially

1268
02:22:46.20 --> 02:22:52.44
the early podcast where we would not they weren't as long and and now I look at I go man

1269
02:22:52.44 --> 02:22:58.92
I go we get to get right back into that thing right back into that thing you did you did

1270
02:22:58.92 --> 02:23:03.48
speak to Patton you did boards I knew it as well which I gave you that copy you gave me that copy

1271
02:23:03.48 --> 02:23:12.84
yeah it's signed by Lave Babin not by General Patton I'm not quite a valuable copy of

1272
02:23:12.84 --> 02:23:21.80
Oras I knew it and it is signed by Lave Babin and I am damn bravo that disappointed yeah

1273
02:23:21.80 --> 02:23:28.84
you posted the copy that I originally gave you about face the other day and you know it had

1274
02:23:28.84 --> 02:23:33.80
my my you because you made me sign it you were like hey bro you needed to sign this and I was kind

1275
02:23:33.80 --> 02:23:39.32
like whatever you thought it was I was like bro you give me my book you needed to sign the book

1276
02:23:39.32 --> 02:23:44.60
and I've put a date in it you know I'd never give the present to anyone and so or gifts of any kind

1277
02:23:44.60 --> 02:23:51.40
and I've never given anything to anybody really have I ever given you anything I go books oh yeah

1278
02:23:51.40 --> 02:23:56.28
so yeah I've given you some books I just gave you the I just gave you about face yeah all right

1279
02:23:56.28 --> 02:24:02.60
so anyways but when you ask me I was kind of I don't come from the background of giving things

1280
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:11.000
in in the in the on the scale of gift giveers like tacos you know 10 is greatest one is the least

1281
02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:20.68
um tacos like 02 Jamie covered move caucran sent like my sent my oldest daughter flowers for

1282
02:24:20.68 --> 02:24:27.48
her birthday whatever a year ago or something like that from me and my daughter did not even

1283
02:24:27.48 --> 02:24:33.08
remotely believe it for one second yeah she's like who did you get to send me flowers and I was like oh

1284
02:24:33.08 --> 02:24:41.08
Jamie I can't lie can't lie to my daughter so there you go pretty cool so yeah I did sign your book

1285
02:24:41.08 --> 02:24:47.56
and and then we just we just re we re enacted the signing of the book and I put the same thing

1286
02:24:47.56 --> 02:24:53.000
so there you go all right echo Charles speaking of getting better yes you said oh then you you

1287
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.20
started asking us of course do you have any more questions no for the crew here no no that was more of my

1288
02:24:58.20 --> 02:25:01.88
that was my takeaway that's how it's regarding this book the whole time like that's your little

1289
02:25:01.88 --> 02:25:07.96
treasure that you found finally after your journey you know I wonder what's gonna happen now like

1290
02:25:07.96 --> 02:25:15.96
once this comes out is is stack pole books gonna reassure it or is jockel publishing somebody's

1291
02:25:15.96 --> 02:25:21.40
gonna dig their like grandfather's copy out and there's gonna be nine of one the internet all

1292
02:25:21.40 --> 02:25:27.40
by seven hundred fifty books yeah all by him you know how much old hardcover copy of about

1293
02:25:27.40 --> 02:25:31.64
faces like they were on they were on Amazon the other day now you can buy it they were a little

1294
02:25:31.64 --> 02:25:38.68
two hundred bucks yeah two hundred bucks I have twenty copies all right there we go

1295
02:25:39.88 --> 02:25:44.20
yeah okay all right getting better right we're on the path okay we're getting better even

1296
02:25:44.20 --> 02:25:50.68
in for good by the way like you know what he call we're maintaining vigilance yes big time for sure

1297
02:25:51.72 --> 02:25:59.16
but anyway on the on our road of improvement for improvement is what we're doing okay we're working

1298
02:25:59.16 --> 02:26:03.96
out every day all right life not to put you too much on the on the spot but you work out every day

1299
02:26:04.68 --> 02:26:09.88
I try to okay so that was my answer to which you know that that's a non-answer by the way

1300
02:26:09.88 --> 02:26:16.52
because there's varying levels of try not to say that that's you know that yeah listen the goal

1301
02:26:16.52 --> 02:26:22.52
is work out every day sometimes I achieve that on a you know on a weekly basis cool I knocked it

1302
02:26:22.52 --> 02:26:30.36
out other times you know so life gets in the way but every every the days that I miss work out

1303
02:26:30.36 --> 02:26:35.24
it's it's deeply regretful and when you don't do that it's it's a problem yeah and and I

1304
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:39.64
actually you've got to kind of be honest with where if that's the goal like for real goal you know

1305
02:26:39.64 --> 02:26:43.88
to work out every day that is a good thing as opposed to you know like I'm going to try to work

1306
02:26:43.88 --> 02:26:47.72
out this week you know there's a difference is what I'm saying so hey well there's a big difference

1307
02:26:47.72 --> 02:26:52.92
you're not going to try and work out every day and I'm going to work out every day yes sir yeah

1308
02:26:52.92 --> 02:26:59.000
and then if you want to talk about just keep it real yeah and as far as better and where it's

1309
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:04.04
goes for sure for sure anyway so when we work out every single day is this conversation we're going

1310
02:27:04.04 --> 02:27:08.28
to have with life in a jockel is that what's happening because that's what I'm feeling I think it's

1311
02:27:08.28 --> 02:27:13.16
it's widely unnecessary to have it with you at this time you know I'd rather go ahead you know

1312
02:27:13.16 --> 02:27:18.28
your joints will jam you up if you let him I'm not going to talk too much about this right now

1313
02:27:19.16 --> 02:27:24.60
I don't even appreciate that I don't think we should anyway I don't think we should even think about

1314
02:27:24.60 --> 02:27:29.48
it that much right it at all joint should be a thing you don't think about you seem to say

1315
02:27:29.48 --> 02:27:34.20
at point I see where you're going with this and I like it yeah what should we be thinking about

1316
02:27:34.44 --> 02:27:40.12
gains obvious yes yes so let the joints just be joints he seems saying anyway so if the joints are

1317
02:27:40.92 --> 02:27:45.40
monopolizing your attention here's what you do boom jockel feel joint warfare these are for your

1318
02:27:45.40 --> 02:27:50.36
joints for sure super krill oil for your joints I take those every day for sure every day

1319
02:27:50.36 --> 02:27:55.88
you know what actually I I had I had an eye surgery recently and so I had to stop taking it for a

1320
02:27:55.88 --> 02:28:01.000
little bit and like I know it what's crazy about those is when you stop taking them like why they

1321
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:08.04
stop taking why did they actually tell me to but like I just you know I just I just didn't take them

1322
02:28:08.04 --> 02:28:12.28
for like three or four days you know because you were like laid up and whatever not really laid up

1323
02:28:12.28 --> 02:28:19.24
but just just like I got I got off your routine I was off my routine yeah and it was it was

1324
02:28:19.24 --> 02:28:28.52
like I I feel it I definitely feel it and there's it's it's it ain't just it's real it really is man

1325
02:28:28.52 --> 02:28:33.56
you feel the joints and and I think both both krill oil and joy warfare are awesome love yeah

1326
02:28:33.56 --> 02:28:38.12
man it just keeps you kind of boom on the path in that way so boom yeah don't worry about

1327
02:28:38.12 --> 02:28:42.60
joints anymore you don't have to is what I'm saying anyway another thing you don't want to be

1328
02:28:42.60 --> 02:28:47.16
worrying about is getting sick because that's one of those things is face it we're not every day like

1329
02:28:47.16 --> 02:28:54.84
fighting to boost our immune system or something like this maybe we are maybe not consciously

1330
02:28:56.44 --> 02:29:02.84
okay so when you wake wake up yeah well you better do some good enough you better up

1331
02:29:02.84 --> 02:29:09.96
doco so at for a yeah whenever you wake up are you like okay let me get this immune boosting

1332
02:29:09.96 --> 02:29:15.08
scenario cracking right now it's consciously part of your routine consciously part of my routine

1333
02:29:15.08 --> 02:29:22.92
I have my supplements lined up when I go into brush my teeth in the morning doesn't count

1334
02:29:22.92 --> 02:29:26.36
I do what I'm supposed to do totally doesn't count what I go into brush my teeth at night

1335
02:29:26.36 --> 02:29:30.60
I do what I'm supposed to do that includes both brushing my teeth taking my supplementation

1336
02:29:30.60 --> 02:29:34.20
and flossing which I never flossing till I join the Navy the Tome and Flossing so I

1337
02:29:34.20 --> 02:29:40.04
are flossing okay cool do you take supplements pre workout yes yeah me too yep what are you taking

1338
02:29:40.04 --> 02:29:46.52
I take three super curl three joint warfare and vitamin D oh like for the pre workout you mean

1339
02:29:46.52 --> 02:29:51.48
like for the workout you know it's but I it's different not for the workout but be prior to

1340
02:29:51.48 --> 02:29:56.12
yes I do yeah is that what you're asking yeah like is that when you take them rather than do you

1341
02:29:56.12 --> 02:30:04.28
take something before the workout for the workout yeah yeah yeah usually yeah usually the

1342
02:30:04.28 --> 02:30:09.72
no it's that's it's good I just I just was kidding yeah I do I take it every morning

1343
02:30:10.44 --> 02:30:16.12
it's part of my routine and then in at night and we had this whole guy I do not want to talk

1344
02:30:16.12 --> 02:30:21.000
about this right now but echo did not have a routine and therefore he would miss just like

1345
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.76
you just said life you got out of your routine and you miss like that's a real thing set up a routine

1346
02:30:26.76 --> 02:30:31.40
follow it yeah and that's an invariant sometimes to make sure they're terrorist aren't tracking you all good

1347
02:30:31.40 --> 02:30:39.24
I know yeah good idea yeah and when you all out of the routine workout or taking the you know

1348
02:30:39.24 --> 02:30:45.08
the supplements supplementation as we like to say um that can sort of become the routine

1349
02:30:45.08 --> 02:30:50.52
same same or part of it it is not even thinking about it all right well anyway back to the

1350
02:30:50.52 --> 02:30:56.20
immune system thing so technically you're just like hey I'm gonna go ahead and take this stuff so

1351
02:30:56.20 --> 02:31:00.76
I don't have to worry about my immune system kind of thing you're not consciously what look

1352
02:31:00.76 --> 02:31:06.04
I'm not splitting hairs here but it's significant it's significant it's kind of think anyway

1353
02:31:06.68 --> 02:31:12.20
immune system like ultimate point with that is you don't have to worry about that either no vitamin D

1354
02:31:12.20 --> 02:31:18.04
three and call the doctor and call the or boom look the combo now you're really not worrying about it

1355
02:31:18.84 --> 02:31:25.48
anyway also after you're done not worrying about these things you don't have to worry about now let's

1356
02:31:25.48 --> 02:31:31.96
start with the conscious stuff okay we got discipline right good really good helps you think I would say

1357
02:31:31.96 --> 02:31:38.04
think but here's what I noticed about this about this but this plan where it's one of those ones where

1358
02:31:38.04 --> 02:31:41.80
you know how like when you go somewhere like you always want to have a little drink going whether

1359
02:31:41.80 --> 02:31:47.72
be water or whatever I think this is the best thing for that I agree maybe not before we go to

1360
02:31:47.72 --> 02:31:55.80
bed or whatever but yeah I thought you pound that I just watched you I just crushed two of these

1361
02:31:55.80 --> 02:32:02.52
dude this is my new that you were notably smarter this entire podcast I noticed it but what are you saying

1362
02:32:02.52 --> 02:32:10.68
the bar wasn't very high okay I gotta say I am not a sour apple sour apple guy like I if I was

1363
02:32:10.68 --> 02:32:17.56
a kid eating jolly ranchers like I would leave the sour apples there unlike JP to know sour apple

1364
02:32:17.56 --> 02:32:25.80
sniper is legit yeah that is it's awesome my family actually is all over the map I mean don't give

1365
02:32:25.80 --> 02:32:30.36
me wrong dax savage oh it's dax savage you're going through dax savage has been my go to for a while

1366
02:32:30.36 --> 02:32:38.60
but uh but sour apple sniper is is awesome and I gotta give JP credit for that's legit it's awesome

1367
02:32:38.60 --> 02:32:42.92
yeah those I'm kind of with your family and that one where here's what I found and this might be

1368
02:32:42.92 --> 02:32:46.68
the case for all this it's only reason I'm mentioning it so remember yeah when it first came out I was

1369
02:32:46.68 --> 02:32:52.44
like man this is the best one a little bit better than jockel pomer what straight up yeah so that's what

1370
02:32:52.44 --> 02:32:56.92
I heard a lot of that and you know it's funny people like say it to me like you're all in either

1371
02:32:56.92 --> 02:33:03.08
one or two ways one is like you know I kind of like this sour apple sniper like they kind of

1372
02:33:03.08 --> 02:33:08.20
ashamed to tell me and then the other ones like sour apple sniper is way better yeah so you can

1373
02:33:08.20 --> 02:33:14.44
yeah yeah so but I did find out there's like a deeper game within the game it was it was probably

1374
02:33:14.44 --> 02:33:24.12
better because it was new straight up because I kept out there no sweet yeah here and I'll

1375
02:33:24.12 --> 02:33:30.36
tell you something else just just to just to people might be thinking about this I want to drink

1376
02:33:30.36 --> 02:33:35.16
this stuff all day long yeah I want to drink jockel pomer I want to drink it all day long but it

1377
02:33:35.16 --> 02:33:42.60
does have caffeine in it 95 milligrams caffeine so I don't want to drink seven discipline goes so we are

1378
02:33:42.60 --> 02:33:50.60
making a discipline go type drink that doesn't have any caffeine but and it's it's going to be a ginger

1379
02:33:50.60 --> 02:34:02.04
ale flavor a ginger flavor and I've already approved the taste of it and it's really good and

1380
02:34:02.04 --> 02:34:07.88
what's cool about it is it's it's on the sweet side I have to admit the sour apple sniper kind

1381
02:34:07.88 --> 02:34:12.52
of started making me like yeah start leaning me a little bit more sweetness so the ginger

1382
02:34:14.28 --> 02:34:18.12
is it's it's nice sweet but here's what makes me think about it is that night you know you

1383
02:34:18.12 --> 02:34:23.32
get done with eating your tomahawk steak sure and you have a little sweet tooth but you're too full

1384
02:34:24.12 --> 02:34:29.24
for a mulk because that's face it we could go just straight to mulk get your dessert on but you're

1385
02:34:29.24 --> 02:34:33.40
a little bit full the tomahawk was bigger than normal okay but you want to have a little

1386
02:34:33.40 --> 02:34:39.88
little sweetness crack it open boom there you go decaf yeah decaf so we're working it okay good

1387
02:34:39.88 --> 02:34:43.56
well there it is there's also discipline powder by the way life you mentioned pre-workout that's

1388
02:34:43.56 --> 02:34:48.76
might go to pre-workout to the discipline powder with water most of the time we actually were talking

1389
02:34:48.76 --> 02:34:54.20
about this like that I the the discipline powder is awesome what flavor do you like lemon lime

1390
02:34:54.20 --> 02:35:02.60
tame is legit because jaccopommer powder is freaking legit the other day it was sour and

1391
02:35:02.60 --> 02:35:09.16
so cold is good for sure and I made I made I mixed up a picture like you do and like they do

1392
02:35:09.16 --> 02:35:15.08
in the like they do in Texas bro a big glass picture I filled it up with ice put the jaccopommer

1393
02:35:15.08 --> 02:35:20.04
in there and it was a huge amount and I just drank that thing all day it was freaking awesome

1394
02:35:20.04 --> 02:35:26.68
so get your jaccopommer on yeah agree my recommendation also you know what what's cool about that

1395
02:35:26.68 --> 02:35:30.76
I think with the powders you can you can dilute a little bit you know so you can you can you can

1396
02:35:30.76 --> 02:35:37.56
have the attention I have a problem good like many Americans the problem that many Americans myself

1397
02:35:37.56 --> 02:35:45.40
included have is simply stated more it's better so so I like mixed these things it what's these

1398
02:35:45.40 --> 02:35:51.48
things called deco these these glass things are no wait what do you mean the glass tumbler

1399
02:35:51.48 --> 02:35:56.52
tumbler so I get these tumblers and you know let's face it you only need two

1400
02:35:56.52 --> 02:36:01.64
scoops of discipline into one of these tumblers well in your case but I will know doubt

1401
02:36:01.64 --> 02:36:06.68
but I will know doubt put four scoops in there more is better and it doesn't need it but

1402
02:36:06.68 --> 02:36:11.24
you know you just think I might as well get that extra little later I know it's going to be a

1403
02:36:11.24 --> 02:36:15.96
good time with the mustard when we've got a tumbler up there on the stage mixed up and you get

1404
02:36:15.96 --> 02:36:21.32
you're drinking at the bottom of it you just get all powdered here let's get so you're

1405
02:36:21.32 --> 02:36:26.84
going to fire this thing up here you're good so yeah that's you know okay let's just talk

1406
02:36:26.84 --> 02:36:32.20
about that for one second okay the early musters where we were disorganized on the back end we we

1407
02:36:32.20 --> 02:36:36.76
had a lot of stuff to learn and so we would sleep not at all I'm in the New York

1408
02:36:36.76 --> 02:36:42.04
Muster we slept a one hour one night if that and the next time we got like an hour and 45 minutes

1409
02:36:42.04 --> 02:36:48.12
and if it says you're cognitive if you sleep less than five hours it's like your drunk

1410
02:36:49.32 --> 02:36:53.64
have you ever heard that yeah if you sleep less than five hours it's like your drunk your

1411
02:36:53.64 --> 02:37:00.68
it has her to humanity meanwhile you and I are up on stage for seven straight hours that day

1412
02:37:00.68 --> 02:37:07.08
answering questions you know people are coming at us with all kinds of leadership problems and

1413
02:37:07.08 --> 02:37:11.08
I didn't hear you up there going I'll tell you what you're not in my bed

1414
02:37:13.08 --> 02:37:17.56
how do they come up with that who's the scientist this says like well here drunk if you

1415
02:37:17.56 --> 02:37:22.28
slept less than you and look I'm not trying to get crazy here and you know for everyone that

1416
02:37:22.28 --> 02:37:27.000
freaks out about this in discipline goes freedom field manual I explain sleep is necessary I get it

1417
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:32.20
it it's good for you it's healthy I tell everyone get as much sleep as you can I'm totally

1418
02:37:32.20 --> 02:37:39.000
down for the cause sleep it's great but to go and say hey if you don't get eight hours you're a

1419
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.64
drunk you're in a quiff and a being drunk and all that's it think about in Vermonty man

1420
02:37:43.64 --> 02:37:48.44
we're launching on drunk cop Falcon you know we're going into South Central Remadi neither

1421
02:37:48.44 --> 02:37:53.96
you or I had slept at all yeah we were up we've been up for 24 hours at that point and we're

1422
02:37:53.96 --> 02:37:58.68
launching on operation where we're going to be out on the battlefield for 48 hours so it's like

1423
02:37:58.68 --> 02:38:04.36
what do you do like you you just power through like this you just be yeah there's I mean you know

1424
02:38:04.36 --> 02:38:08.92
when we when we got into position and I got security set like I tried to take her down for an hour

1425
02:38:08.92 --> 02:38:13.64
you know just to try to get a get some shut eye while I could while I was dark before the sun

1426
02:38:13.64 --> 02:38:18.52
came out we knew we were going to get it on as we got attacked but life requires that you're going

1427
02:38:18.52 --> 02:38:23.32
to have some sleep this night and you got to be able to get some and and you can get some more

1428
02:38:23.32 --> 02:38:27.80
if you have some a little bit of discipline on a little bit of discipline go whatever have we

1429
02:38:27.80 --> 02:38:32.84
had some discipline go on the cop Falcon up would have been that much better I think Relady would

1430
02:38:32.84 --> 02:38:40.52
have been secured a lot quicker I think the drunk reference comparison was like when you're driving

1431
02:38:40.52 --> 02:38:44.44
yeah okay so now if they take oh the number of actions that happen from people that are drunk

1432
02:38:44.44 --> 02:38:49.88
to the number of people that fall asleep the wheel okay cool got it in a way I got it in a way being

1433
02:38:49.88 --> 02:38:55.000
like overly tired driving could then again I don't know could be worse if it's because people

1434
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.68
were sick of the wheel because you can't control it you get the point where you can control it

1435
02:38:58.68 --> 02:39:03.96
with like being drunk because it's you know it's facing sometimes when people are drunk behind

1436
02:39:03.96 --> 02:39:09.24
the wheel they get like more daring and aggressive so they'll you know it's less that like

1437
02:39:09.24 --> 02:39:14.60
oh they're drunk and they drift as trash you're saying it's their attitude more than their

1438
02:39:14.60 --> 02:39:19.48
motor speed in there yeah this and then sure a lot of times you can't react as fast as you're talking

1439
02:39:19.48 --> 02:39:25.72
about lack of sleep so it's kind of like leaving nylon at like two o'clock in the morning

1440
02:39:25.72 --> 02:39:31.16
the red bull run yep and had we had some discipline go back then obviously we'd be that much better

1441
02:39:31.16 --> 02:39:37.48
we know she was good away we'd been good to go you know so hey you know again not to split

1442
02:39:37.48 --> 02:39:42.20
hairs but you know these things sometimes you know you add a little nuance little explanation

1443
02:39:42.20 --> 02:39:46.04
they start to make more sense yeah it was what I think that's what I mean what else we got

1444
02:39:46.04 --> 02:39:52.36
job white team or your kid milk milk what else anything else talk a little bit bunch of cool stuff

1445
02:39:52.36 --> 02:39:55.96
yeah and so by the way you can get a bit origin main dot com you can also get them at the

1446
02:39:55.96 --> 02:40:04.36
vitamin shop and you can get them at a little place called wawa in Florida and the Virginia area

1447
02:40:04.36 --> 02:40:11.000
and by the way if you're in those areas go get some yeah going to a wawa clean it out

1448
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.96
yeah it's a different situation like I mentioned before is it because look online even if you

1449
02:40:15.96 --> 02:40:20.92
got to go I mean vitamin shop Scott is convenient storage like they're not everywhere whatever

1450
02:40:20.92 --> 02:40:24.84
but is a different situation you got to go on there you got to make it a point to stock up and all

1451
02:40:24.84 --> 02:40:27.96
this stuff right now you can just grab one on the ghost way different here's what the here's what

1452
02:40:27.96 --> 02:40:33.80
the folks at wawa are wondering who wants this stuff should they should they put it in every store in

1453
02:40:33.80 --> 02:40:40.60
America that's what they're wondering wherever store that they have if you want to you can support

1454
02:40:40.60 --> 02:40:48.52
the cause just clean them out let them know we want we want it is in demand it's in demand

1455
02:40:50.36 --> 02:40:55.24
all right also yes okay you you mentioned origin main dot com that's where you get the can get

1456
02:40:55.24 --> 02:41:00.44
jockel fuel which is all of this stuff also at origin main dot com is jujitsu stuff geese rash

1457
02:41:00.44 --> 02:41:06.44
guards some shirts on there and also of course jeans and boots American made delta denim is

1458
02:41:06.44 --> 02:41:11.48
back in the game by the way if you're awaiting on delta jeans they're back and we got more denim

1459
02:41:11.48 --> 02:41:16.12
so we're good very good also I got my Lincoln boots getting broken in right now nice little

1460
02:41:16.12 --> 02:41:21.08
jut nice what do you mean Lincoln boots that's what that's the one with the toe cap oh that's

1461
02:41:21.08 --> 02:41:26.52
yeah the model did you did you request the toe cap or did you just get it from Pete he just sent you

1462
02:41:26.52 --> 02:41:35.24
what he want yeah you got to watch out dude Pete is sneaky Pete tries to try to impose his will

1463
02:41:35.24 --> 02:41:40.20
on you like I was like no I don't want to talk out I don't know as I said I don't come to the

1464
02:41:40.20 --> 02:41:44.28
Lincoln's give me the regular ones and he goes yeah yeah I didn't watch shows up at my house

1465
02:41:44.28 --> 02:41:50.92
the regular ones and the pair of Lincoln's and I'm like bro he does he does these little sneaky

1466
02:41:50.92 --> 02:41:56.76
things and he thinks he's getting one over on you that's the thing Pete we're track it bro

1467
02:41:56.76 --> 02:42:01.56
we are tracking he likes to do that I like the toe cap it's good oh oh here's another thing you

1468
02:42:01.56 --> 02:42:08.84
did to me I said hey bro I wear white geese I wear white geese so you know this was

1469
02:42:08.84 --> 02:42:16.20
pretty early into the whole merger and he's like he's like oh yeah yeah definitely what does he send

1470
02:42:16.20 --> 02:42:20.52
me and I said you know what in a stretch maybe a black bee why is that by the way

1471
02:42:21.40 --> 02:42:28.76
traditions the tradition it's the tradition the first geek he sends me no shit it's blue

1472
02:42:28.76 --> 02:42:34.84
the only color I said hey look he don't send me a blue geese I I wear a white geese maybe I get it

1473
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:40.04
black you know what the you know the most popular color to get geese and the like just an origin

1474
02:42:40.04 --> 02:42:46.28
oh which means yes in the world black yes black yeah which which to me white was the

1475
02:42:46.28 --> 02:42:52.52
tradition that's what we do we keep a tradition but let's face it what's the facts the facts is

1476
02:42:52.52 --> 02:42:59.72
everybody wants to be an ninja that's what it is they're having a little yeah makes sense for me

1477
02:42:59.72 --> 02:43:06.52
I want to be Charles Bronson in the movie the mechanic they're they're wearing white geese and

1478
02:43:06.52 --> 02:43:11.64
that's what I always refer back to in my opinion some of my training partners and instructors

1479
02:43:12.04 --> 02:43:19.80
I've sent them as a gift origin rift geese and we are I think we're six for six for black

1480
02:43:19.80 --> 02:43:27.96
yeah the black riffs yeah did you request white no no I said tell me what you want oh yeah

1481
02:43:27.96 --> 02:43:33.56
there's a little one said me a black one well that's that means a lot coming from Todd White

1482
02:43:33.56 --> 02:43:39.000
right because he's an artist he understands the color palette yeah he's not sure same he's

1483
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.88
down there thinking what will look good the it I got to say though on the for the riffs we've got

1484
02:43:43.88 --> 02:43:52.12
we've also got six out of six like outstanding reviews as well the rift is ridiculous yeah it's kind

1485
02:43:52.12 --> 02:43:57.96
of junk not the ghee but the situation because you know a lot of us we have more than just the one

1486
02:43:57.96 --> 02:44:02.84
ghee you know so you do the rift now all those other geese sort of seem absolutely a little bit you know

1487
02:44:02.84 --> 02:44:09.08
like you don't put that down you know the old ones you know yeah that's just how it's like a new

1488
02:44:09.08 --> 02:44:13.40
iPhone when you get the new iPhone you're kind of like this is old well it happened with the iPhone

1489
02:44:15.72 --> 02:44:23.16
not the six the 11 oh the no seriously the the iPhone six you're like oh you know it's okay

1490
02:44:23.16 --> 02:44:28.92
and the battery run out the pictures sucked and all this stuff I was with the dorogan

1491
02:44:28.92 --> 02:44:33.64
like last year and we were we were taking pictures of the sunset while we were hunting

1492
02:44:33.64 --> 02:44:39.96
yes his picture looked freaking he had an iPhone 11 it looked brilliant filled with colors it

1493
02:44:39.96 --> 02:44:43.96
looked like a freaking national geographic picture because we were taking pictures of the sunset so you

1494
02:44:43.96 --> 02:44:47.96
could see like the mountains and then there was the horizon and then there was a sky all beautiful colors

1495
02:44:47.96 --> 02:44:53.56
my picture just looked like black on the bottom and white on top and I then I just said I'm

1496
02:44:53.56 --> 02:44:59.48
an idiot they call that dynamic range yeah so what you're saying is you don't realize

1497
02:44:59.48 --> 02:45:04.12
that you don't realize how good something can be until you actually try out the new and I

1498
02:45:04.12 --> 02:45:08.12
think it like task in a bruiser I was like I thought we were pretty good in my first task

1499
02:45:08.12 --> 02:45:12.76
in it until we were in bruiser and like actually weren't that good task in bruiser better

1500
02:45:12.76 --> 02:45:19.88
and the rift is definitely like that girl and like okay it's kind of a game but Pete I don't think

1501
02:45:19.88 --> 02:45:24.84
he's sneaky I think oh he's sneaky but I think he's like smart he's in that way because look

1502
02:45:24.84 --> 02:45:29.000
there's what it was we think he's a big difference yeah that's what I'm saying I agree with his

1503
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:35.08
difference so the the the the ghee right so I wasn't down for the other color geese either all

1504
02:45:35.08 --> 02:45:39.88
ahead it was white for a reason like I'm like cause you're one of my black belts one of the people

1505
02:45:39.88 --> 02:45:45.32
yeah I yeah it was true but here's what Pete was thinking is my hypothesis he was like look I

1506
02:45:45.32 --> 02:45:49.40
get it they like the white he that's the tradition can argue with that but they just haven't felt

1507
02:45:50.04 --> 02:45:54.68
the power the pleasure of the black he they just if I can get them to somehow feel what I'm

1508
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:59.24
feeling about okay so he'll give you a friend when you be like I can't wear this thing and you put it

1509
02:45:59.24 --> 02:46:04.44
on you're like feel like I can't wear the eye of the ninja after all right Pete is successful boom

1510
02:46:04.44 --> 02:46:10.60
did that with the boots for you Pete gets some level of credit for his sneaking this but just so you

1536
02:48:41.96 --> 02:48:46.52
it's long as it's a video less than five minutes there may be cool stuff if it's a long video

1537
02:48:46.52 --> 02:48:51.72
that actually would be nice to see some effects and they won't be there okay you know I

guess and you can see what life looks like if you're not um or if you're intrigued by his

1539
02:48:57.08 --> 02:49:05.08
Texas Batman um persona voice wise get a pretty appropriate way to put it we got something called

1540
02:49:05.08 --> 02:49:09.96
psychological warfare it's an album with tracks that I talked to you about overcoming your moments

1541
02:49:09.96 --> 02:49:18.20
of weakness you can get that on any MP3 platform out there in the world it was the number one

1542
02:49:18.20 --> 02:49:26.12
selling spoken word album for 11 months on iTunes and it makes sense it makes sense because it's not

1543
02:49:26.12 --> 02:49:33.40
just artistically uh good or whatever it's effective function uh how many spoken word albums are

1544
02:49:33.40 --> 02:49:39.000
there a ton of the questions yeah there's that I will say this there's something in the universe where

1545
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.72
sometimes you know how you're like if your bluetooth on your phone just randomly syncs up at your car

1546
02:49:44.28 --> 02:49:50.20
and like if my kind of darkest or lowest moments like it seems to like sync up and just random

1547
02:49:50.20 --> 02:49:54.68
these select and it's Jocco's voice and it's usually it max of all you everything happens

1548
02:49:54.68 --> 02:49:57.96
for a little bit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that moment of weakness creeping in and you're probably

1549
02:49:57.96 --> 02:50:05.96
heading to the donut shop and that thing comes on uh also flipside canvas my brother Dakota Meyer

1562
02:51:36.20 --> 02:51:42.92
way the warrior kid four you can preorder it right now it's called way of the warrior

1563
02:51:42.92 --> 02:51:46.76
do you know what the name of the new way the warrior kid is you might know yes do you know what it is

1564
02:51:46.76 --> 02:51:55.80
I do not it's called way of the warrior kid four field manual premises the last day of school

1565
02:51:55.80 --> 02:52:00.44
you know marksman having some hard years but now he's kind of getting dialed in last day of school

1566
02:52:00.44 --> 02:52:05.88
kid comes up to him and says hey you know I've never really talked to you before and I notice

1567
02:52:05.88 --> 02:52:10.68
you know you wear that warrior kid I see you doing pull ups with your friends and this kind of

1568
02:52:10.68 --> 02:52:17.48
kid's kind of shy and he says I really wanted to be a warrior kid like you and now it's too late

1569
02:52:17.48 --> 02:52:24.68
because I'm moving away and you know I just wish I could have hung out with you and so Uncle Jake

1570
02:52:24.68 --> 02:52:31.24
shows up and and Mark tells Uncle Jake about this and says you know hey this I feel really bad

1571
02:52:31.24 --> 02:52:36.52
this kid's moving away he wanted to be a warrior kid he was too shy to say anything and he's you know

1572
02:52:36.52 --> 02:52:40.36
wanted me to help him but I don't know what I could do and Uncle Jake says I know what you can do

1573
02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.52
right him a field manual on how to be a warrior kid so there you go and uh it's the same

1574
02:52:47.80 --> 02:52:53.96
let's say shape and size as the discipline equals freedom field manual you may notice some

1575
02:52:53.96 --> 02:53:00.04
similarities when it comes to the layout just the layout of the cover it's funny

1576
02:53:00.04 --> 02:53:10.44
John Bosaque the artist the designer whenever I say it's like a good idea he always says I think

1577
02:53:10.44 --> 02:53:15.64
you might be on to something there so I was explaining the cover warrior kids in the

1578
02:53:15.64 --> 02:53:20.60
later he is I think you might be on to something there so yeah so way the warrior kid for is

1579
02:53:20.60 --> 02:53:28.68
available mic in the dragons which has been described as the greatest children's book ever written

1580
02:53:28.68 --> 02:53:33.56
I that's what I've heard sure I mean I'm not look I wrote it I don't want to you know be

1581
02:53:33.56 --> 02:53:41.64
out of line here but apparently a lot of people think a lot of people think and the discipline

1582
02:53:41.64 --> 02:53:45.72
equals freedom field manual oh by the way there's a new version of that coming out you know what

1583
02:53:45.72 --> 02:53:51.80
it's called Mark one mod one you know what that means kind of yes some cameras are like that this

1584
02:53:51.80 --> 02:53:56.52
I go mark one mark two mark three so this is the first modification to the original discipline equals

1585
02:53:56.52 --> 02:54:03.16
freedom field manual there's a bunch of new pages in there wrote about a bunch of new things

1586
02:54:03.88 --> 02:54:09.64
so you can check that out and then of course there's a little book called Extreme Ownership

1587
02:54:09.64 --> 02:54:15.72
that I wrote with my brother Dave Babin and the follow up to that book which is called the

1588
02:54:15.72 --> 02:54:21.64
dichotomy of leadership the things that we heard us talking about today if you want to see how to

1589
02:54:21.64 --> 02:54:27.16
take those things and apply them to the what you're doing in life whether it's your business whether it's

1590
02:54:27.16 --> 02:54:31.64
your first respond whatever you're doing whatever you're doing if you're interacting with other human beings

1591
02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.64
get to the source extreme ownership in the dichotomy leadership

1592
02:54:38.04 --> 02:54:43.56
Ashland front what's up with Ashland front Dave we got got like going on with Ashland front work with

1593
02:54:43.56 --> 02:54:48.20
leaders all the time you know as we talk about it just been phenomenal watch them particularly through

1594
02:54:48.20 --> 02:54:54.52
this tough times of you know some some economic turmoil through COVID lockdowns and and unrest across

1595
02:54:54.52 --> 02:54:59.96
riots across America etc like it's been it's been awesome to see companies taking apply those

1596
02:54:59.96 --> 02:55:04.12
principles and so we've got got some great stuff going on Ashland front I think particularly for

1597
02:55:04.12 --> 02:55:11.80
EF online are we if we have redesigned that thanks to the great echo Charles who put some

1598
02:55:11.80 --> 02:55:18.76
mastery behind that are for our our our landing page and design and set up and we've streamlined the process

1599
02:55:18.76 --> 02:55:23.24
of logging on that thing and we've got troopers from I think I'm glad you get the great echo

1600
02:55:23.24 --> 02:55:28.52
Charles I seem to end up with the average echo Charles over here I think we're wreck is wrecking

1601
02:55:28.52 --> 02:55:36.20
I think we're happy with that good joke I think we have 46 countries around the world represented

1602
02:55:36.20 --> 02:55:41.40
yeah EF online what we're doing is we're look our goal our mission at Ashland front is to teach

1603
02:55:41.40 --> 02:55:46.44
the leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield that we translate into everyday business

1604
02:55:46.44 --> 02:55:51.000
everyday life how to lead how to lead up and down the chain of command doesn't matter if you're

1605
02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.28
it doesn't matter if you're the the CEO or a frontline person that's not in charge of anyone

1606
02:55:56.28 --> 02:56:02.20
when you are interacting with other human beings you are in the leadership position you can

1607
02:56:02.20 --> 02:56:07.80
you can do things to improve the mission you can do things that will improve your station in life
