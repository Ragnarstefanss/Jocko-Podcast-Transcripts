and cheeseman during the first few days of his demobilization is wife died miserable and forlorn he returned to his old job in Covent Garden and a few years later he met in married Bella who in his own words was a comfort and inspiration to him Charles Raven joined the London Transport as a bus conductor later transferring to the clerical staff and rose by hard work and study to be a garage inspector Joe Thomas and George Harris went into the building trade industry in Bridgewater surprisingly just incredibly normal paths after this incredibly not normal life and and what happened to Sydney Jerry so here's what happened to Sydney Jerry back to the book arriving in England on 9th July 1945 I reported to the holding battalion of the Hampshire Regiment at Westgate on sea and was immediately sent on 28 days leave after night out in London with three friends also berm a bound I telephone my parents and found them away caught a train from waterloo and went to see them staying at the same hotel as my parents were flight lieutenant Jack weatherlies widow Peggy and their three-year-old daughter Anne we're staying at the same hotel as his parents at once a bond of deep understanding and affection developed between us in August and Adam Baum was dropped and so at a stroke my visit to Burma was rendered pointless so two in my heart was a military career I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine with the first battalion of my own regiment for two more interesting years and finally was demobilized in May of 1947 within a week of leaving the army I attended a job interview the managing director who saw me a pale and thin-lipped man was a business acquaintance of a relative he eyed me coldly slowly and precisely from his desk he lifted a ruler which he rudely pointed at my face I understand that you made a slight name for yourself in the war be that as it may people like you Jerry should remember that while you have been galleventing around the world most of my staff had remained loyal to the company if you can give me one valid reason why should even consider you for any position I should be interested to hear it I nearly hit him now I wish that I had quickly grabbing my hat no umbrella I rose and told him that if he was the last man in the world I would rather starve than work for him with that I left my heart pounding and a foul taste in my mouth I walked aimlessly through miles of streets wishing that I was back on some battlefield with real men soldiers like 18 platoon armistice day brings its problems pagan I would like to go to church we used to go but found almost without exception a lack of perception and sensitivity amongst the clergy we suffered one armistice day sir sermon devoted to the curates theory that war being a crime against humanity all chivalry must therefore be hypocritical I wondered whether the German stretcher bears and their wounded at sin drn would have agreed I took offense pagan I have a lot to mourn she jack weatherly and I 18 pltunes dead perhaps it is expecting too much of anyone to understand intense grief particularly that of an now aging platoon commander who had to lead some of his men to their deaths we now spend armistice day quietly at home with our ghosts memories abound during the night I made a habit of wandering around the platoon position so that each of my soldiers could talk to me I learned a lot they talked about their families and their future hopes I hardly had to contribute to those whispered conversations that some times took place in the dead of night or in the cold gray light just before dawn I think it may have helped my soldiers to have a confidant invaluable experience of human nature I now treasure the memory weapons also left memories the monotonous repetitive bursts of the brain the hysterical shriek of the mg 42's for furious rate of fire and the lethal chatter of the stands and schmysers all contribute all contributed to the cacophony of battle traceable it seared themselves into memory fired from a distance the parable approached almost lazily until suddenly like a swarm of fiery demons they accelerated directly past one's head with earspooling cracks I shall never forget the brain splitting shockwave as mortar bombs detonated nor the rending of the atmosphere when a stick of nebel war for bombs straddled one slit trench my memory is stocked with smells the metallic stench of dead cattle and Normandy the punching odor of German prisoners and the vial penetrating chemical smell from a newly plowed shell creator strange fleeting memories too why in circumstance of great danger did the palms of my hands moisten making it difficult to grip the butt of my pistol why on pitch black knights full of menace was it possible to discern enemy movement by fixing my straining eyes slightly to its side it sounds foolish but I swear that it works after 40 years I am sure I could still prime a 36 grenade in total darkness or load the magazines of a cult automatic pistol I remember our dead their souls departing they lay awkwardly like bundles of discarded clothing at bedberg lands corporal portius lay by their railway crossing in an instant he had gone leaving his body clothing and equipment empty at halvin boom private jones died with a tiny cry boston the chill winter air as the bullet took him from us memories are not all sad rarely since as my adrenaline flowed as an advance to combat with all the senses alert one lived for a few hours sometimes for day at a concert pitch like a drug it captivated me I wanted more totally absorbed one pressed on until objectives had been seized then I flopped as I had never done since I remember the mood of pulsating expectancy during the last few hours before battle old trusted friends like Dennis Clark and brandly handcock would arrive to tie up their artillery support others troop commanders from the Sherwood Rangers would appear almost in party mood demari up with us the very air was vibrant with excitement and good fellowship no acrimony simply an exercise and willing cooperation to help us the infantry over come the day's grim task but my most treasured memory is the simple and sincere affection which existed between us all based on mutual trust it was the cornerstone of the platoon success and it survives unchanged to this day this is changed with regret regret because Jim Kingston owned cheeseman and particularly Doug Proctor did not receive any recognition they so richly deserved Jim and Owen were mentioned dispatches but Doug was left unrewarded over the years this omission has troubled me particularly because I had not been so had I not been so young and inexperienced more notice might have been taken of my representations I have no doubt that they all learned a military metal on more than one occasion and I their platoon commander failed them in this respect I miss my soldiers the warmth of their presence comforted me and their humor restored my spirits in the brutal world of infantry warfare although few of them realized it and certainly none would admit it their behavior was noble their absence left avoid which but for an exceptionally happy marriage would have certainly drawn me back into the army for the comfort that only a soldier can understand strangely I have never since considered myself anything but a soldier and that wraps up that book and I'm not sure if I have much to add because because Sidney Jerry seems to capture it and so much of what he talks about explains so much not only about about being a soldier but also about what it's like when a soldier is no longer a soldier to to miss the adrenaline to miss that singular focus to miss seeing men at their best at their noblest to miss the men themselves your comrades your friends your brothers to miss what he calls so perfectly that simple and sincere affection that exists in a platoon in affection that I'm not sure exists anywhere else and you you hear me talk about when I start talking about a seal platoon about how that's the best thing in the world and Sidney Jerry captures it better than me you miss the mission and you miss the men and of course you miss the fallen as the British call them the glorious dead and you wonder what would have become of them where would they be now and you you wonder why why them why was it them and you know I talk about the gift right the gift that they gave us that the fallen have given us this gift of freedom and this gift of life but there's there's more there's more because you see the rest of us we grow old from time passes us by and that that simple and sincere affection that Sidney Jerry describes it changes as we change it ages as we age but the fallen do not change the fallen do not age time has no effect on them they remain they remain young and bold and brave and uncomfortable and so we remember them that way as they were and as they will always be are heroes heroes who walk no more and yet walk everywhere with us who smile no more and yet they never stop smiling heroes who live no more yet never stop living are friends who shine no more and yet never stop shining and that is the other gift that they give us the fortune to panic and remember I think that's all I've got for tonight. so he I think he does grab another guy in this occasion but he goes out and he's going through this field and it's like a corn field or something and he can't see and he's horrified and he he's trying to think of a reason to quit he's like I just want to go back this isn't smart and as he's as this is taking place and this is fear is climaxing all of a sudden he hears oh, bunch of cows that have fielded right so he's doing another solo operation here trying to find out what these tank like assault guns are doing out there back to the book climbing up above the tracks I put my head into the coupla which was open a familiar interrible stench hit me inside was a sharnell house six inches away a set of bear teeth set in unrecognizable black and incinerated lump grinned it me beside it a charred and bony arm reached up in agony spread on the floor like a pool of tar lay the melted remains of the driver I had entered Dante's inferno my head reeled and with my mouth knows and lungs filled with the stench of death I fell back to the ground although unmarked by fire on all on our side all three assault guns had brood up and were blackened on their sides which faced the enemy with no stomach to look further I ran back to the company for getting to look for American minds never again did I look into a knocked-out tank or self-propelled gun I reported to Douglas that nobody in the right mind would use them for an observation post or for any other purpose later that day he asked that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander of a Sherman tank to fire some armor piercing shells into each of them positioning his tank hold down beside 16 platoon positions which were two are left the tank commanders the tank commander first selected the assault gun I had visited his first shell hit it slightly above the tracks like the hammer of Vulcan a red glow blossomed on the armor plate around the point of entry and slowly faded it was followed by a second and third shell until a morage of heat appeared above it and for a second time the funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent ferocity the Sherman gunner then turned his attention to the next assault gun which despite being penetrated by about six armor piercing rounds failed to brew up his first shot at the third caused a massive internal detonation no doubt due to amination stacked within a volcano erupted from its coppola sending a dense cloud of black smoke and red sparks into the air a truly wagonarian end for the warriors entuned within but it revolted me for the rest of the day I brooded this communicated itself to my nco's and soldiers who stole mystified glances at my grief for an unknown enemy during the afternoon I wandered across the road to a lone house where Dennis Clark had his observation post I was looking for solace from a wise and good friend a post was filled with gunner officers there must have been a dozen of them setting up their equipment and preparation for an attack by 214 brigade this activity precluded any solace for me immature and undisciplined my imagination ran riot what were they like these men whose already incinerated remains had been blasted into oblivion by the 75 millimeter shells of our friend in the Sherman my attitude to war was ambivalent undoubtedly I was part pacifist but despite an abysmal record in mathematics and particularly in geometry I was moderately logical for my age this clearly ruled out total dedication to pacifism I had previously discussed the concept of conscious objection with clergy of all denominations but none of them could give me constructive answers to my questions the privations and suffering of 18 putoon hurt me an infantry subaltern is faced with a conflict which cannot be resolved one gets emotionally involved with those under one's command without this bond few men will respond and consequently little can be achieved however to win battles decisions have to be taken and orders given which at times may seem to be a betrayal of this trust before battle the commander must exude confidence and enthusiasm whatever fears his private thoughts may hold just how thin the line divides this from deliberate deception I call it the commander's dilemma a pretentious phrase but there is nothing to be done about it the Nicholas Montserrat's book the cruel sea poor commander Eric Itson makes the point with poignancy it's the war the whole bloody war we've just got to do these things and say our prayers at the end there was another side possibly caused by adrenaline danger attracted and excited me I felt elated and until the battle was over I was impervious to exhaustion commanding a platoon embattled demands not only a clear mind right he had brewed a mess tin of tea on a solid fuel stove by any standards this was an inspired act he was considerate with our reinforcements pale unsure men some of whom until recently it served in the royal artillery and it been transferred to infantry regiments to replace the appalling losses incurred in the Normandy Bocage beside them Raven looked bronze in weather beaten a hardened campaigner complete with a German luger pistol to prove it some of the platoon regaled the reinforcements with horrible tails from Normandy and else as little more than a schoolboy I found these stories amusing Raven did not fear for him was horribly real and never to be joked about he developed a eternal attitude toward the newer and younger soldiers a relationship devoid of patronage but essentially one of kindly understanding he spoke to me about it when I thanked him for his help I admit I'm dead windy sir his extraordinary honesty with himself and the rest of the platoon forbade him to attempt to hide the fact Raven in overtaxed his nervous and physical resources long before we arrived in hoven woods after two days in the position he came to me late one evening and asked my permission to report sick the following morning I suppose I should and fettically have refused but something made me hesitate and avoid dealing directly with the situation I said simply all right Raven but do come see me before you leave he didn't come the matter was never again mentioned I can only surmised the struggle which rage in his mind all that night while he crouched in his waterlogs slit trunch peering into the sinister darkness of the wood I do know however that in hoven wood a considerable moral triumph over stark horror was achieved by a good man unequipped for nature unequipped by nature for war in my view the bravest of the brave so that guy Raven had been through all this stuff and just barely held the line and finally he was going to break finally he was going to break and he comes to city gerian says hey I'm gonna go sick tomorrow send the gerian says okay come and see me before you go it doesn't come back it doesn't come back to him doesn't go sick back to the book infantry warfare is wretched business it makes physical and emotional demands on participants that run contrary to all human instinct the strong minority must quietly help the weak majority to me that is the essence of good teamwork and that jewel in the crown of the British army the regimental system is the strong foundation upon which we all knowingly or unknowingly relied so there's going to be some people that deal with it better than others and you got to help um here's a situation they set up early warning flares so little trip wires in case to to notify them if the enemies move and down one of their flanks and here we go back to the book after about 10 minutes had passed we heard the popping of mortars behind hoven village in a concentration of bombs fell in the fields where we had laid the flares suddenly our left flank was vividly illuminated as flair after flair ignited knowing little about these flares we had laid them with the trip wires to talk had we allowed a degree of slack the flares were not a vergnited my fault I should have known had to fill the extreme ownership from Sydney Jerry and therefore y'all now he's talking about the attitudes of the soldiers and how soldiers you know there was a claim he read an article years after the war that said that people you know people became brutal from the from the war and here's what he says back to the book does war brutalize one can only speak from personal experience I was far too young and inexperienced to appreciate that an infantry platoon was the finest command in the army and that's the success or failure of a battle so often lay solely in the hands of a young officer after careful reflection I doubt that at any time since the war have I carried the burden of responsibility that I bore as a subaltern in battle when an army corps division or brigade was committed to battle it was the battalion company in platoon commanders who took over the mantle of responsibility from the generals and brigadiers in close country for us and street fighting the platoon commander became the lynch pin only the company and platoon commanders particularly the latter were able to have close relationship with their soldiers which is a prerequisite for having above average success failure by one infantry company could record a divisional battle plan conversely gallant success like B company at Xan 10 underwrote the battalions victory again I would emphasize the analog with the bond of professional respect between a great conductor and the members of a symphony orchestra without which a truly great performance is not possible outstanding performances cannot be arranged in a concert promoters office the created by some magic by the conductor in players in rehearsal and performance similarly while senior commanders appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their battions and brigades they could not extract a great performance from the riflemen upon whom victory depended only the company of platoon commanders supported by their NCOs could ensure that 42 years on I get considerable satisfaction from 18 platoon successes more so than I got at the time so those are his thoughts and he's the wars now over and a few days after the war ended well go to the book after cholera and noculations we were conducted into the world of Frankenstein nothing had prepared us for what we now experienced not hill one twelve not mount pinchon else or hoven could compete with this horror before the incredulous eyes of 18 platoon spread over acres of delightfully wooded countryside was a factory of death and they sheaded bodies resembling wax effigies of an alien race from a strange and distant planet filled many pits the stench of death and the sight of such highly industrialized human degradation left my soldiers speechless private macy d companies deep driver aptly summed it up there is now no doubt that we have fought a just war that's after they saw the concentration camps obviously back to the book within a month of the war ending 21st Army group was required to supply junior officers for the 14th Army in Burma lipy the commanding officer decided that I should be one of them and by then being intent on a military career I was not inclined to argue I would gain useful experience of jungle warfare of which I knew nothing about so they're getting orders still a war going on in the Pacific yeah back to the book I now have little doubt that for the first two months in Normandy we lack two things comprehensive and imaginative training and personal experience of battle we were also seriously handicapped by our casual attitude too many junior officers did not think for themselves and persistently relied on the narrow teaching of battle schools who's dogma had assumed the proportion of holy rit so whatever he was taught he was taught that that's the only way you can ever do it and these guys and if talk about this many times on the on the podcast the goal when I was running training was to actually get the people to think it wasn't get sure you have to establish the baseline standard operating procedures that's great and those need to be rock solid but once those things are established you need to make people understand that you don't always follow them and you need to call off a piece of that standard operating procedure to insert some other thing and bring in another standard operating procedure and mix and match them so you get something that's effective you need to think that's what a leader needs to do a leader needs to think back to the book the British infantry platoons and companies were overtrained and board stiff with basic infantry tactics which as far as they went were good much of this training unfortunately had been in the hands of battle school instructors who themselves lacked battle experience and imagination these tended to become pedagogues disciples of DS directing staff solution about which no argument could be tolerated so DS is that he be he mentions in a bunch like that's their solution the directing staff you can't argue with them they're the they're the cadre possibly like most of our entry infantry they suffered some consequences of the pre-roar shortage of creativity intelligent regimental officers two few of them were professionally dedicated to the extent that they could visualize how battles would be fought and identify the problems that might arise when planning them they seemed to lack the capacity to think relentlessly through these things until solutions were found much of their time had been spent policing the British empire also unlike the Germans we British instinctively avoid displays of keenness the enthusiast particularly if he is innovative isn't embarrassment thus the battlefield became our teacher and inevitably it exacted a grim price in blood and time so as you're training you got to push yourself hard you've got to put yourself in situations I don't care what you're training for I don't care if you're training for combat in a sea of platoon in an army infantry platoon or if you're in the business world and you're training your leaders to handle situations or you're training your customer service reps to handle situations what no matter which one of those you're in you need to push people hard you need to put them in worst case scenario so that they need to learn how they need to learn how to think to get out of those problems but then once they're on the defense and they're just waiting to get shell they start to stoop they start to crouch a little bit he continues back to the book the jokes began to peed around and the cheerful good morning surf ceased when I went around the platoons at stand two morale was always higher during an attack sitting around and being sheldt is not an occupation to be recommended so there's a good lesson there if you or your team is being defensive about things your morale is going to go down because you're waiting to get hit so go on hit somebody you know go on the attack don't wait around don't let your morale drown here's another attack back to the book scrambling out of the culvert we set a fast pace up the side of the road to a company's positions this immediately brought small arms fire down on us but by then we were then 200 yards of their slit trenches so on we ran as fast as we could being soaked I began to steam my boots squelched and seemed to drag me back clawing at my feet as in a bad dream and stopping me from reaching the inviting cover of the slit trenches a company was dug in with two platoons forward in an orchard face to face to the enemy who were in dikes only a few yards beyond the third platoon was to the right rear protecting the open flank and company headquarters to the left rear centered on some farm buildings it was to these farm buildings that we ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on the barn floor we lay panting and gasping for breath john a cock a company commander appeared round the door of the barn he looked haggard and warned I doubt he had slept for a week the whole company area was covered by the most intense spandell fire and defensive and the defensive battle here was one of fire supremacy which the Germans had undoubtedly won a company's morale was low they had just lost hairy barns one of the platoon commanders who refusing to take cover strutted about an usual manner he took a complete burst of spandell fire under the arm hairy was an amazing and fearless fellow who didn't care a damn for anything even after the burst hit him he still lived for about three hours the men respected hairy and with their idle shot down in front of them they were very jumpy another time you have to watch out for morale obviously now if you remember this book started in the summer time and now we're starting to get towards fall and this this is something I never thought about before when fall comes you know the sun is up for a shorter period of time so here we go back to the book the nights became longer and the dawns gray and chilly the sun sets were red and vivid and the days though beautiful short and rapidly as the nights lengthened the hours of staggered lengthened and with them the mental and physical fatigue of the company so they have to stay up you know rotate through watches at night you just don't get to sleep the whole time but also considerable emotional force I suspected is the same transmitted force that exists between a conductor and orchestra 40 years later the dilemma of my ambivalence is still unresolved I find the suffering inflicted by war unacceptable particularly amongst women children and animals thank God I was spared the horrific sights at felays on some days I am a pacifist and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds of guns and but for an extraordinarily happy marriage would have found it difficult to resist the lore of soldiering so what he calls the commanders dilemma this one I call the dichotomy of leadership and that one is the premier of them all and that is as a leader as a combat leader you are going to love your men and care about them more than anything else in the world and with that you are going to make decisions and make plans where you are sending those men into a situation where they can be wounded or killed and that's it and that is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership that is the hardest one to balance it back to the book a new officer arrived named Humphrey's he used to play cricket for warstisher he came on the same day that sergeant Oxlyn received a well-earned commission in the field Douglas told him about sergeant Oxlyn and with great consideration he went to 17 platoon's position to offer his congratulations while they talked just one salvo of one oh five straddled them one shell fell into second lieutenant Oxlyn's slit trench and both were killed instantly like me can Oxlyn has survived five months Humphrey's survives not a full day is there a mathematical formula by which survival can be calculated who are the survivors and can they be recognized over the past 40 years I've often pondered this but still offer no real answer I suspect however that is something to do with attitude attitude seems to me to be a parameter which restricts not only our relationships but also our creative effort further comment is on wise Humphrey's one cargue had little time to develop an attitude to our kind of existence undoubtedly a self-fulfilling circle develops newcomers inexperienced in the perils of the battlefield suffered the highest casualties knowledge of what can and what cannot be wrists post-pones the fatal reckoning for the soldier for the commander however junior battle field experience will not only protect himself but also all those under his command and that's that's why training is so important it's so important and that's why when I got done with you know deployment to her body that's why I went to training because I knew that right there and I was thinking you know I didn't know I was wrong the war was going to last and when we left for money where money was still horrible and when the task unit came in relieved us man they were getting after it oh group after the oh group I made myself unpopular by asking why we're advancing towards an area of considerable German opposition when my patrol found a better route by which we might outflank the enemy so that so he's saying hey wait what because his patrol his puttune had been out on a patrol and found a better route and he's asking why and he kind of gets shut down I was just twenty years old at the time and even then I knew I was incapable of disputing orders without giving a fence we started at zero six hundred hours two platoons leading on either side of the track the third falling in single filed down the track itself on either side were the small holdings were small holdings a few allotments in bungalows surrounded by small picket fences but platoons advanced through the gardens and vegetable patches and passed on either side of the bungalows the rear section searching each one quickly and while they're searching these little bungalows as their own patrol they find this back to the book during one of these hurried searches one section found a Dutch family the widdages father mother son and daughter riddled by schmites or fire that's a German machine gun they lay in awkward postures of death amid their ransacked home a visit from the SS no tears came nor did they come a half an hour later when we came upon the charred wreckage of an american decoda it had carried US parachute troops the 82nd airborne division and their torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard like charred and mutilated rag dolls it was a further iron or irony attached to the front window in what remained of the decoda's cockpit was a tiny teddy bear untouched by flames two months before a lonely teddy bear and an impersonal pool of blood had brought forth tears now I was collected and objective when faced within the span of thirty minutes within a trotious murder and mass carnage by fire and he's referring there in the beginning of the book one of his first experiences he's by a slit trench and there's a dead guy soldier in it and there's a little teddy bear and and for some reason you know he's young he's in experience and it gets gets makes him super emotionally starts crying and and now he's a little further in the war he sees you know this horrible murdered family and these tragically you know burned and killed paratroopers and he's able to detach emotionally from it back to the book the enemy decided to make life unpleasant for us as possible by sudden unpredictable concentrations of heavy artillery right in the middle of our company area we called them stunks but we did not know who is going to take over our positions the take over was to be at night and was to be carried out as quickly as possible if the enemy discovered it a determined attack could cause endless confusion and slaughter during the late afternoon of one particularly unpleasant day Douglas appeared that's a company commander appeared within American captain in two lieutenant's from a parachute battalion of the hundred and first airborne division they patied around the company area in their rubber-sold boots with the eyes of the whole company following them it's a hundred and first is coming into a leave him having reckoned ordered our area the Americans returned to the company HQ to discuss administrative points for the takeover the plan was for the American company commander to bring his company down the main road in single file along the edge of the ditch when the head of the column reach our company HQ they would be met by guides from each of our platoons to lead the American platoons to their positions as soon as they were on the ground our platoons were withdraw and assemble on the road this may sound simple in practice at but at night in close contact with the enemy it certainly was not this type of operation leaves two companies particularly vulnerable during the handover a determined enemy could attack and turn the operation into a massacre this is one of and I've said this before on the podcast one of the hardest things to do is link up with friendly forces on the battlefield and if you're under fire it's it's even harder so this one they're trying to do it not under fire trying to sneak and make it happen back to the book the rest of the day was spent packing making sure the enemy noticed nothing of this antit activity we put our spare ammunition onto the carriers with great coats and blankets the whole afternoon was strangely quiet there was no activity from the enemy and we in turn kept quiet the sun went down a mid-a-firey sky looking east the sky was threateningly gray I went around I went around my position to with Sergeant Kingston before the Americans arrived all my men looked tired and could hardly muster a smile as I went from slit to slit many had contained two men and now contained only one together with some momento of his former mate a mess tin or a bloodstained jacket even a packet of cigarettes wet and limp with dew I wondered how many more momentos would be there when the Americans were relieved about an hour later the Americans arrived they loomed up in the darkness by the roadside padding along in the rubber sold boots without a whisper I fought at the time what splendid troops they were and how excellent their equipment I was particularly impressed by the silent and quick way they were led by their squad commanders to our section positions so there come the Americans who leave them the hundred first airborne division who's just outstanding soldiers they're just awesome i think he must have been a German medical officer turned and saluted in our direction i returned the salute and with that gesture the tiny battle of cinder and ended in bremen little over a month later one of our stretcher bears Lance Corporal J. Stevens was killed by a German grenade as he went to tend to wounded German soldier 18 platoon remembering cinder and were justifiably outraged by such unsolderly behavior there is a mathematical formula aggression increases the further one goes behind the lines opposing infantry with few exceptions like the SS are joined by a natural bond of mutual compassion which few but the aristocracy of the battlefield can understand the public influence no doubt by writers with literal no experience of battle have strange and sometimes silly ideas about what makes a good soldier ill informed television programs of added to this misunderstanding few professions can be have been so misleadingly caricatured i had had i been asked at the time before august 1944 to list the personal characteristics which go to make a good infantry soldier my reply would indeed have been why to the mark why to the mark like most i know doubt one of suggested only masculine ones like aggression physical stamina a hunting instinct instinct and competitive nature how wrong i would have been i would now suggest the following firstly sufferance without which one could not survive so he's listing what he thinks the most important characteristics for a for an infantry soldier out of the first one is sufferance the ability to suffer secondly a quiet mind which enables a soldier to live in harmony with his fellows through all sorts of difficulties and sometimes under dreadful conditions as in a closed monastic existence there's simply no room for the assertive or acrimonious thirdly below no less important a sense of the ridiculous which helps the soldiers are mount the unacceptable add to these a reasonable standard of physical fitness and a dedicated professional competence and you have a soldier for all seasons none of the soldiers or nco's who made 18-platoon what it was resembled the characters portrayed in most books and films about war all quiet sensible unassuming and some by any standard were heroes if i now had to select a team for a dangerous mission and my choice was restricted to stars of the sports field or poets I would unhazitatingly recruit from the latter very interesting it's a name of the city village casualties from the preceding companies in the opposition lay all around about 300 yards short of the town were extremely accurately engaged by a battery of 105s some of their shells exploded on the hard surface the road your splitting detonations and frightening fragmentation pieces of shell casing hummed and wind around us one trolling peace embedded itself with a foot into the trunk of a tree a few inches from my right ear was the only time in the whole campaign when i regretted throwing away my steel helmet i think it was the accuracy and the intense noise of the shelling that caused it one of 18 pertunes lance corpoles a big man who had served honorably since market garden went to pieces there was a pathetic site and to everyone's credit he was quietly removed from the battle he had passed his limit and nothing more can be said so you don't know these guys are brave at one moment and then a week a month two months four months they can't do it anymore they get across the line now they're fully in Germany there's a little bit of a low in the fighting back to the book early one morning while we were waiting for our supporting armor to arrive our podry john Williams drove over to see us after wandering around the platoon for a chat he suggested he suggested that we should go for a short stroll i had now been commanding 18 platoon for over eight months and i suspect that our agitant Tim Watson a kindly soul had asked him to find out what shape i was in we had not gone far into the next field when he came across some grizzly remnants one of our artillery shells must have exploded right at the feet of a German soldier who had been digging a slit trench his splintered and twisted spade lay beside laid by the side of that half dug trench beside which was a small shell hole he had been disintegrated into small pieces of flesh and bone which they scattered all over the field had I been on my own I would no doubt have shuttered and quickly departed from this horror draped over a wire fence nearby lay a parachute which are extraordinarily brave podry spread out as a shroud on the cold and damp grass then stupid he walked around the field a lonely figure reverently picking up every piece of that poor soldier to my shame i stood and watched him i lacked the courage to help somewhere beneath those flat damp fields just north of the line that pallet it pathetic bundle must still lie now they're in attack again but it seems like things are going their way I mean it ended up not lasting that much longer that kind of intense fighting but it was impossible to tell at that time we would just barely seeing stuff start to get better at the end of our deployment just barely starting to see the first indications of that back to the book the fifth Duke of Cornwall's light infantry had attempted to attack Hove and village through these ghastly woods and had taken heavy casualties their reign soaked bodies littered the paths and clearings while carrying out a reconnaissance I came across one of their sections lying along a small path facing the enemy at first I fought them alive until I saw that the studs on their boots were rusty and their webbing equipment was bleached with rain their battle dress was starched with mud and their hands and faces were green German booby traps were on or near many of the tracks and I was told by the company commander of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we took over the position that some of the bodies were also booby trapped don't try to bury them he said I was temporarily commanding the company because Douglas had been given a well deserved leave in Brussels although militarily comparatively un-adventful Hove and has a special place in my memories it was without doubt my most the most grizzly and horrifying position that we ever hold held but more importantly it was the place of private Charles Raven's triumph Raven had fought in all our battles since hill 112 which to him was a yardstick of horror all subsequent experience was compared with that his first battle he was no soldier I doubt if he influenced greatly any of the skirmishes and counters or battles in which he took part sometimes he was frightened and he was so out of place on the battlefield that I often wondered how he became an infantry soldier before the war he had been a clerk in north London I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal employee and a considerate and loving husband for unlike most of us he was married Raven had hidden depths and could be inspired once in Normandy during a nasty little platoon attack up a sunken lane 18 platoon was held up by the inevitable unlocated spandows straining my eyes through binoculars I was trying vainly to locate these guns when I was handed a steaming mug of tea he should have been observing to his front but judging the moment The Patoons are getting overrun and people are getting me you know shot with paintball and they're not hitting their objectives and I walk over to the company commander he's sitting in a home v I'm sorry the the to you commander the troop commander he's sitting in a home v and I like the windows up because they're both windows but he doesn't want to get shot with paintball the windows up he's just sitting in there he's got his head set on of his radio like knock on the door I'm like hey man you know what what's going on out there he's like well I'm I'm trying to gather that information right now hmm I recall within bearishment an incident at 45th Infantry Division battle school during the spring of 1944 an exceptionally tall and good-natured Canadian officer had been sent to the school to give a talk on the street fighting he had experienced nearly it was an interesting talk but some of his advice ran contrary to that being taught in the school when the lecture was over the chief and instructor with insulting condensation thank this shy and kindly man for a vivid word picture and turning to the students warned us that as this officer's experience was probably unusual we had best not stray from the DS solution as taught at that school so you got to combat veteran come and back with experience from street fighting in Italy and he'd come back with some different tactics and they tell him you don't listen that guy that's just a rare case close mind will get you killed this is starting to talk about they're overall sort of formulation of combat plans and how they operated back to the book the most successful actions by 18 Paltoon were fought without the support of artillery or armor we had learned in a hard school how to skirmish infiltrate and edge our way forward the right or left flanking platoon attack so beloved of the battle school staff would rarely succeed in the Normandy Bocage I remember with harbing locked into timetables of meticulously planned large battles these invariably left the junior infantry commander no scope for exploitation if you found a gap in the enemy defenses adherence to artillery program which rarely could be altered effectively stopped any personal initiative so I decided to take a total patrol strength of six men one brand with seven magazines and three armed with stands with five magazines and four thirty six grenades each plus a pair of wire cutters I carried my cult four grenades and a non-brella my umbrella had been a source of amusement to the battoons inside found on the roadside in muc apart from keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench it was useful when prodding for mines and brought some fun and color to our lives Jim Kingston and Doug Proctor fought otherwise maintaining a disapproving silence which I failed to notice so now they're out on patrol moving down the bank the right we crawled forward in the mud and wet grass into we're almost past the orchard from which came the sound of digging and voices suddenly a challenge came from our front followed by a shower of stick grenades thrown from a trench just inside the orchard on our left one of the grenades landed between my legs which were stretched out and spread apart as I lay flat on the river bank there was no flash it's explosions seemed muffled and more importantly owing to the soft mud I received not a scratch the game was up now the concentrated fire of the three stands poured into the German into the surprise Germans putting away my pistol I threw three thirty six grenades in quick succession into the orchard heardly reaching from my umbrella which alluded me and then enormously, economically we'd be to retreat so he gets a graze throw on him and actually had this happen until you bruiser some guys were out on a patrol they were an open field they had cover from one side because they had pre-plant how they were in a crosses field and while they were out there they got hit with machine gun fire and then mortars and they got mortars dating like on them and luckily because it was they were in like a muddy field like almost rice paddy scenario the mortars when they hit they went into the mud but I think not certainly no soldier of mine was made brutal rather the opposite war developed in 18 puttune consideration for comrades and humanity towards civilians and prisoners of war I was proud of my soldiers then and this sentiment has increased with the passing of years I would not suggest that the naturally brutal might not find in war and outland for their brutality however that war does not brutalize the type of decent man the type of decent and fair-minded young English men whom I had the very great honor to command we were not an aggressive generation a fact which may explain my failure to understand some present day attitudes in the armed services particularly in the royal marines and the parachute regimen possibly a degree of personal aggression is appropriate in troops are who are committed to battle for comparatively short periods like the marines and the paras when the success of an operation depends on ultra rapid action however in my experience troops lose personal aggression after about two months in battle after three months they acquire a mature compassion which in no way detracts from their offensive capability they simply know a lot more about war I would suggest that personal aggression should not be confused with offensive spirit based on professional competence and experience interesting take that aggression that you can maintain if you it's not going to last rubber and he says one day when you're in charge of battalion you'll understand why that is and the reason why that is because you got the good guy and that's the guy you're going to send out you're going to rely on the people that get it done well this is an interesting we got another patrol that they're getting ready to have to go out on and the patrol was to probe between the roads and advance if possible as far as the forest beyond this its purpose was indeed vague Douglas called me and another platoon commander to company HQ and explained it to us he then suggested we should toss a coin for an embarrassing situation arose I thought that the winner would lead the patrol the other officer anticipated that the loser would I lost the toss and got the job so so imagine that you and me are saying all right there's a dangerous patrol we're going to have to do let's flip for it I'm thinking heads if I win I get to do the patrol you're thinking if you win you don't have to do the patrol not everyone was quite as fired up I guess this is Sydney Jerry was and they they wrap up a relatively kind of un-eventful patrol relatively un-eventful patrol and he's he realizes it back to the book no young officer can command a puttune in battle on his own in Normandy I'd seen puttune commander served by poor nco struggling to gain some semblance of control over their but wielded and frightened men I'd also seen puttunes with good nco's go to pieces in the hands of an indifference officer Jim Kingston Doug Proctor and Owen cheeseman set the standard n-tone for 18 puttune without them I as the puttune commander would have joined the ranks of so many poor young officers who never achieved grip now going to another we're putting together another plan as they're advancing and obviously this is a long book I'm doing an abridge version hitting some highlights you should get the book obviously get the book by the book back to the book at zero four hundred hours on twenty-fourth of September Douglass this is the new company commander Douglass held along I thought I'd remember and I was right Dennis Clark was a was an artillery guy that called an artillery so here we go back to the book I was saved by Captain Dennis Clark MC our team gunner Dennis had a virtue also touch where 25 founders were concerned sniping with one gun that should get the buggers out he said with total confidence moving his 19 set into my that's a radio moving his 19 set into my platoon position no easy task in daylight he gave us a display of the most brilliant professionalism we had come to expect from the 94th field regiment by firing with only one gun and making his mean point of impact beyond the diek containing the Germans he slowly decreased the range yard by yard until one shell exploded in the diek out came five very wet and shaken pans or grandadiers during this episode all the platoon had to remain in the bottom of their slith trenches because Dennis' shells came over our positions with minimum clearance I doubt if any experienced infantry officer would deny that the Royal Artillery during the second World War were the most professionally competent people in the British Army so again an interesting dichotomy because in the beginning he talks about how the artillery can track them because it's being used in this broad plan that's locking in with there's no deviation but here he's talking about how brilliant it is because he's directly coordinating with it he's explaining to the artillery officer where to put those rounds what the problem is and then letting the artillery officer solve it and it's that same attitude that I saw with guys in Ramadi the same attitude alright now he makes a statement here about this whole big operation which was called market garden which was this giant operation to try and caught off the Germans sees multiple bridges and there's three bridges they were trying to seize and it it didn't reach its full effect it wasn't like a complete mission success they didn't achieve every objective that they wanted to so here we go back to the book market garden was a sad operation complete success coming so close at a stroke the war in Europe could have been finished in 1944 undoubtedly mistakes were made both by the first airborne division particularly their planners and also by 30 core and there was no shortage of bad luck however in my experiences in my experience most battles are riddled with misfortunes and mistakes and the of the sort found in this operation it was not a failure because the ground was taken and a prerequisite to both operation veritable and the rind crossing so wasn't like a total failure back to the book I'm convinced that had the supreme commander generalize now are given market garden the unqualified support that it justified it would have totally succeeded despite its crop of tack coerres and planning and execution I suppose it was just one more casualty of the american mania for dispersal of effort however it was without a doubt the most exciting and imaginatively planned battle in which 18 puttune ever fought
