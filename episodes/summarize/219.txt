And that's like the kind, like you just get one person to see, like hey, or even realize, You know, the kind where you go, you know, she goes for selection. And when, you know, when you're going down the list of all the new things that they had or whatever, when you think about it comparatively, you know, to what we have or whatever, still like, Pro those are like slave conditions really still. And it's, I mean, you know, according to her, like you just do one single, You know, sign of resistance, you're like, oh, well, they're just killing you. And you know, I just read that as his focus and it seems like everyone's focus was like, okay, we're going to move forward. Ben, when he came in, he said he'd been listening to the podcast a little bit to kind of get a feel for it and talk to you a little bit about what it's going to be like. And it seems like that's what you should do because how many thousands of people said, oh, I'm going to sneak out of the sign and they got seen and they got, Do they got killed? So yeah, the idea of sticking together and having that, and, you know, obviously, like that's what That's what the seal ptune is, you know, that's what any, any team is, right? But, you know, sometimes if people want it, because there was a time where someone's trying to kind of impersonate a little bit. But since you were kind of engrossed in the story when you started revealing it, I was like, Oh, that feels like a relief, even to me, you know, hearing it. You know, you know, I'm going to take a little aside here. As I read that, it seemed a little bit counterintuitive to me because I always think, well, if I just have to take care of myself, it seems like you'd be able to make more things happen as opposed to you're looking out for other people. You know, the reason that I thought, and I had heard that before, like I told you before we started out, I study war a lot and I read a lot about war. Because like, and it makes sense because it's like not even, we need people to work in obey. When the day, when the next day arrives, Mom and Strux us to wear three layers of our best clothes, because we don't know where we are going or how long we will be gone. He seems saying, I'm like, you know, like a thing. You know when you are being told hey pack a bag, hey get on the train, like those things don't sound good It sounds like you read it like you're telling a story which is exactly what it sounds like. The last time I said their in-production, it sounded cool, but it was a little bit of like, like, I was assuming. Yeah, I'm going to make sure this time kind of thing, you know, Yeah. Even if you consider that opportunity, it's just like going to go home and drink some water, some clean water, going to go home and clean yourself. But man, that's, that's how that's like that demonstrates, you know, like, how thankful we should be. What was it like with, you know, a little Christian girl, a little girl that you knew that you played with. And you know, you know, you're a victim of the fear from the people that made it. But two things that really stand out, small, seemingly small, but kind of big, where, like, so they stuck together, you know. I am told this is how they know how much space is available for the new people they bring in by train every day. But what I failed to realize and what I think is that because you're sticking together, you're looking out for each other, you're keeping maybe you give a little bit of extra bread, you share some bread so you're able to take care of each other and people that went by themselves had less of a chance to survive. But the next towns on either side of us, they had like 20 to 25,000 people on each, like Czechslovak, I mean, hung excuse me. So that was kind of like, and you know how you said it was kind of counter counter, counterintuitive. I'm going to fall in love with more and again you tell some really fascinating stories about what goes on inside and people need to get the book to see those to read about those. Even there's the time when I know you're probably feeling this too, where, where she, or might have been Max, I forget which story it was, but they went from the, oh, yeah, once you went to work. When they arrived, they explained that some people cannot endure the severity of the camp and know that if they hold onto the electrified fence, their life ends in 20 seconds. You know, every time I open the book and I go through it a little bit, I just can't believe that this happened to us. Well I hope we can share and educate people on what you went through, on what your family went through, on what happened to millions of people. I don't think I don't know how many people we had there, but I don't think we had more than between 1500 And I got to say, like I said, this whole thing got started when my wife went and saw you speak. And just remember, if you have a problem, if something is going, not going so well, remember tomorrow is going to be better. There's like a lot of luck, you know, But man, her bravery basically was the function or was the result of just milking that luck. You know, in a situation like this, you have to do certain things to survive. And this is just the exact, you know, what they're doing it to an absolute extreme, you know, stripping you naked and shaving your entire body and just removing anything that you had from the past. Even though my husband's family sent us F-A-Dabes to come to America, but still the Jewish organizations need to know who's coming, what's coming and everything else. And to me, you know, sometimes you hear the anti-Semitism is this long-standing thing that everybody knew about for a really long time. And your sisters didn't even want to know where it was going to be. Hey, you know, when we get them, we can see for ourselves, you know? And just looking at this book, you didn't know her at the time, but you made a little inscription to my wife. Going on here, it says all of us notice a huge fire spewing heavy smoke that looks like a burning mountain across the open area from us. Like I said, I just learned that word, so you know, I'm practicing.
