yeah because you kind of know when you're being a dick you don't see unless you're like not being honest with yourself there are some people that don't there's some people that don't get it there's some people that don't get it all right because it's like you know how like when you don't like people they just can't step outside of themselves and you said to me I wouldn't care kind of thing and be like bro but I think you're more if you go extreme with the diet you don't like slowly phase out of the way you know it's interesting you know it's interesting I don't know if you remember I read a letter while back on the podcast about a guy that had read way the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and that guy did what you're saying he just made little changes you know he made little changes along the way but yeah you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever almost like you if you really think about it if Steve Jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways or whatever if you were to be less like that maybe there would be more because they were more similar but he was so strong in these other areas that it kind of like mitigated the effects you know there's there's businesses that are successful because there are successful business model and they have really bad leadership and that's you've been really that bad of a cheat day a cheat day is like fries fries then you're starting to go into it for sure but the I'm like you know a cheat day cheat day like asked Tim held it'll be like for like a whole thing of donuts re box a cook and then they just continue to do it more and more and more and then it doesn't work it's like it's kind of like drugs to regret the like when you like when you flare up on someone and and you win or whatever you know you kind of like it worked nine cups of cheetos later you know what you see and then two cups and respectfully I don't like your cheetos example why because you're like I'm going to allow myself cheat okay don't allow yourself cheetos that's not how small of a change you're going to make if you're not going to eat cheetos anymore you're not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm saying like if you go extreme on your diet let's say you eat yes maybe you should check your ego a little bit then you have to ask yourself do you have an eye for design on artistic eye for design like like divinci or Michelangelo if you have that you you you probably don't if you think you have that maybe you should check his ego again are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey your vision with total clarity to big giant groups broad groups of people and if you think you can do that again you should check your ego can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck to to close the gaps in some of those other areas so if you could do all those things if you answered yes 100% to all those questions and okay maybe you can get away with being a kind of leader that Steve Jobs was but if you're a normal person if you're a normal human being then maybe you should try and be a good leader and maybe you should be a leader that build relationships and forms cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite the ups and downs of whatever business you're in and I know this with you because let's say if I pass your guard sorry you let me pass your guard I don't know you don't spaz and like you know like an tournament where the guys like really trying hard not to let you settle in guard yeah maybe what's the verdict I think just in the like middle of the road not the whole story like same thing I said balance so you're saying balance as well I'll tell you though man if that balance doesn't work for you you're gonna have to step it up you're gonna have to go hardcore I'd give yourself two weeks two weeks for a balanced approach on the diet side if you can't get your shit under control in two weeks you got to go hardcore you got to get in there with a garbage client can throw away the Twinkies throw away everything else that's crap in your fridge and go hardcore and start with a fast too right yeah which is a little bit contrary because you know I always say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield but in the business world if you have a phenomenal idea then you can you can be successful on that idea alone now that is that is a unicorn that is one of those rare things where you have something that's that incredibly different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going to be successful no matter what you know when the when the early gyms MMA type gyms if you had one you were successful didn't matter what kind of leader you were because you had you had it and now there's competition if you're not if you're not good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product amongst all the competitors you're going to have problems but after the things you can't just eat donuts four times a day or three you just don't feel good like your stomach gets all upset and the more healthy you eat the more it's gonna be like that so the longer you're on the path you straight like if you ate some donut like the other day we went to the Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream some mid-chocolate chip ice cream was it and I think that's like the mistake planning people make we say this a lot where people will be like hey I'm just straightforward you know take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like you know what they call framing you know you frame something in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way whatever so he's an extremely driven and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and they're developing negative attitude so having extremely being extremely driven and having high expectations doesn't equal driving them too hard so they develop negative attitude those are two different things you know you can still be extremely high expectations you can be driving extremely hard and you can still have a incredibly positive attitude with your team yeah that's the way it is we and this is like my thoughts this is fact this is like I talked about this in this in the field manual is like look there's no conjecture it's not like I wonder what would happen no it's not my fault when I my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that and about a bunch of people responded you should read the book extreme ownership because it absolutely is your fault it is your fault if your team has a bad attitude it's your fault you're the leader you only attitude if they're attitude is bad then it's then it's actually your fault now this is not to say that you can't have a bad apple on the team that's completely possible and who's responsible for getting rid of the bad apples you are you're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a uh bad apple on your team you might even have two bad apples on your team you don't have 14 bad apples on the team when you have 14 battles the apples on the team guess who the problem is it's you whatever so if you if you're at that point still facing a threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or whatever while you're on the ground compare if you know Jesus you're still saving way more control way more so meanwhile like the box situation or karate situation whenever it's gonna be less effective in controlling your situation no if you don't look at it like that like if you look at it but you said you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what your day would look like like if you like everything you did was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of thing your boxing is your boxing is not worthless you know marginalized we'll say but it's heavily marginalized yeah heavily marginalized yeah same thing with you know kickboxing and whatever so there's that if you know Jesus you're just a little bit of Jesus too if you're on the ground you have control over the fight more depending on your level and it's own right garners respect from most people there's there's a fraction of losers that are like oh echo he works so much it's it's so lame like no like as I'm making him look bad or something like they're you know we'll know that you know little chocolate Domets you know what a total full size donut straight up they're kind of a little bigger too you know Because you know how the old saying where it's like, yeah, we know we had to have a limited time on this earth, but we don't act like it. you know there's just a very relaxed atmosphere where I was I was standing at a very nice part of Australia there's a very relaxed atmosphere when you're in America there's a heightened atmosphere there's a heightened awareness you have to have and depending on where you are and it's the same thing I'm sure in Australia I'll go on the way to the nice part I'm sure you could go to some some tough areas where you better be more aware of what's happening but teach your kids because some kids don't know the difference maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for what kind of people you need to watch out for in the street so work on that and then yes train and up here in U.K. and of course I've said this before if you're truly in a situation where you feel threatened on the regular basis oh I'm like tired now because the workout like was kind of hard it's like oh shit I wasn't expecting that I was expecting to feel right after my workout everyone says whatever so you're gonna run into all these little things that don't tell you about so i'm i've answered this question over and over again and i'm going to do a quick job over here just because people may not they have gone back and listen to all all the other podcasts but you have listened the answers always the same and it's always the same whether you're a young person leading old person whether you're an old person leading young for people whether you're a woman leading man a man leading man leading women whether you're coming in from a different department into a new department that you don't know anybody whether you're going into a thing that you don't have the experience it's like all of the same basically what it is you're going into a leadership position and on that on that cheat day you do they call it the cheat day you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any guilt at all even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to become an off a real strong week to like be to feel good about cheat for three like three burgers are good too whatever you want straight up whatever you want this is disgusting here's the thing though with when you when you start to eat healthy and you then you try to eat a whole box of donuts you're after like one two three maybe six eight donuts you're gonna be like you know you're in six donuts easy you're in six donuts in one yeah that's what it is be humble listen take advice build relationships keep your ego in check also that one of the reasons i pulled the dead pull this question i was like how do you demand respect will be answers you don't demand respect and if you don't if you do demand respect you'll get anything but respect from people so so get that out of your head you earn respect and how do you earn respect you respect them in this case you respect their experience you respect their knowledge you respect it they've been doing it for a long time you have respect for it and when you show respect for them they're going to respect you back now none of this means be passive right this doesn't mean coward down unless yeah you know construction or something you know something like that same thing you're gonna get joint stuff that's so yeah you start with what you can do but there is a little bit of there is there is I would try I would say this keep this one in the in the back of your mind there is the whole thing of like you know what I'm changing my life right now you go home you get the garbage can out you bring it into the kitchen you throw away the twinkies you throw away the pop-tarts you throw away the the you pour the the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the path and you just don't look back but I have all this other knowledge the same rule you try it for two weeks see if you can keep yourself on the path and if you can't got to bring someone in right here's what I like hire a trainer but not like the kind every day it's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program
