00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50 This is Jocco podcast number 269 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening echo.
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:12.000 Good evening and also joining us tonight is Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000 The last podcast with Lave we covered the first part of this Marine Corps manual, which I don't even know if it's not really a manual.
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:35.000 It's like somebody made this. It's called the squad leader makes a difference and I know who made it actually. Lieutenant M. M. Abalday and Lieutenant A. M. Attaro.
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000 They made it at the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab in August of 1998.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000 And we're going to push through the last few pages of this book that we didn't cover last time, but then we're going to dive deeper into the last example, which I actually moved to the end.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000 And if you've ever wondered where these podcasts come from, where my mind is going, if you've ever wondered how I'm thinking through these things, this is an opportunity to follow me down a path of discovery.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000 To learn more about leadership, to learn more about human nature and about war and about history and about fear and about sorrow and about life and about death.
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000 It's an interesting ride.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000 And it all starts by picking up where we left off with this manual.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000 The squad leader makes a difference. The subtitle is readings on combat at the squad level.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000 This book is a book that by its very nature simultaneously establishes and then reinforces a culture of maneuver warfare.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000 It enforces that, it establishes it.
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000 It is decentralized command. It's literally a book about the front line leaders making a difference and stepping up and leading.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000 So, here we go. We're going to go back to the book right now.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:21.000 This one is Sergeant Joe Hooper, US Army Vietnam 1968.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:34.000 Sergeant Joe Hooper was a squad leader with D company, second battalion, five hundred and first infantry, hundred and first airborne division, near Way City.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000 Big salute right now, obviously, to the second of the 50 first.
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000 In January of 1968, Way was captured by the North Vietnamese in the Ted offensive. US forces fought desperately deliberate.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000 Vietnam's ancient Imperial City on February 17, D company was assaulting a defended position along a riverbank outside Way City when it was attacked by rocket and machine gun fire.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000 The company had run into a defensive position, manned by two North Vietnamese companies in dugout bunkers.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000 With the company pinned down by fire, Sergeant Hooper located the source of the enemy fire. He rallied his squad and attacked across the river.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000 He overran several enemy bunkers. This bold maneuver inspired the rest of the company to join the attack.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000 During this attack, some of Sergeant Hooper squad had been wounded.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000 He ran out into the open to retrieve them, but was seriously wounded himself.
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000 Sergeant Hooper refused medical treatment and returned to his men. Enemy fire continued to hamper the attack.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000 Sergeant Hooper led his squad through the bunkers and buildings clearing a path for the company and mortally wounding a North Vietnamese officer.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000 When his squad came under direct fire from a building to their front, Sergeant Hooper assaulted the building himself and killed the enemy with grenades and rifle fire.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000 Upon reaching the final line of the North Vietnamese defenses, Sergeant Hooper destroyed fire bunkers by running the length of the position tossing grenades into each of the dugouts.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000 The enemy soldiers began to withdraw from their positions.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000 Sergeant Hooper then led his squad in destroying the last two Vietnamese bunkers with white phosphorus grenades.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000 After the last pocket of resistance was eliminated, Sergeant Hooper organized his unit into defensive positions.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000 When the remainder of his company caught up, Sergeant Hooper allowed himself to have his wounds treated.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000 Sergeant Hooper played a major role in defeating a large force of North Vietnamese.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.000 D-Company's attack forced the withdrawal of North Vietnamese reinforcements attempting to enter the city. This action outside the city weakened the NVA defenders inside way.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:01.000 Easing pressure on the besieged city and leading to the eventual liberation of the Imperial capital.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000 In oddly enough, it doesn't talk about him receiving the metal of honor or anything after he's charging bunkers by himself.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000 This is just who?
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000 I guess that's just what we're doing.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000 Lessons, Sergeant Hooper displayed exceptional leadership. His endurance despite being wounded served as an example to his squad and his company.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000 After taking initiative to assault across the river Sergeant Hooper squad assumed the role of the company's main effort and spearheaded the attack.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000 His exceptional courage under fire inspired the remainder of the company.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000 Sergeant Hooper's combat decisions and tactical leadership at the squad level contributed to his company's success in this better fight.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000 With the North Vietnamese attempt to reinforce the city halted other forces were able to clear the city.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:05.000 This is obviously the kind of initiative. This is the kind of bias for action that the Marine Corps talks about all the time.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000 This is the kind of initiative that we try and train leaders to have at every level.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000 But they are going to make things happen.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 That's what we want.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000 And they followed up this quote. I've actually, we actually hit this quote before, but I'm going to hit it again.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000 We covered it a while ago on podcast 62, Ardent De Peake, his book Battle Studies.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000 Listen to this though. Listen to this and think about this.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000 Four brave men who do not know each other will not dare to attack a lion.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:00.000 Four less brave men, but knowing each other well, sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid will attack resolute me.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000 There is the science of the organization of armies in a nutshell.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000 When I was in South Africa, late in the South Africa, we worked with some companies down there.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000 But they were talking about how back in the day the African tribes would hunt lions with spears.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000 But they would say, you know, be like three or four guys that would be able to take a lion because they could maneuver in from different angles and they could eventually kill the lion.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And this was after the conversation that I don't know if you know this in South Africa.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000 There's no lions living out in the wild. They're all in these big giant gamers' nerves, which are like the wild, but they're not in the wild.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000 Why is that? Because then you have freaking lions roaming around, killing people. I mean, you're no match for a lion. No match.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000 But if you got some friends, three friends, I mean, if you think about the, okay, what are the odds if you were to do this?
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000 The odds of a human beating a lion in a fight? What are the odds? What do you know? Like it is not, it's almost zero.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000 How is it? How is a human going to kill a lion in a fight? Right? Okay.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000 Okay, you give him a spear. He has some kind of a chance. But it ain't good when a freaking lion's coming at you.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:43.000 That thing's going to, just, it's a slaughter. But as soon as you got some friends, and you can make some maneuvers, now you can not only can you win, you are confident enough that you do it on a regular basis.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000 That's decentralized command. That's not only decentralized command. That's what a good team is. A good team was he calling it.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000 If you're sure of the mutual aid, if I know you got my back, that's the strength of the team.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000 I like how he used the phrase in that quote, the science of organizations.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000 And you think of science, I think of like all this research and all this analysis and all the things, you know what the science of organizations is?
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000 I got relationships. I got your back. That's the science. That's all you need to know.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000 I think that quote, that word actually, I wrote that down, because that that run loudly of, there's actually it's not complicated.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000 This is not complicated. You have to have someone that you trust.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000 If you trust that person, you'll do so much more with just one other person that you trust than what you do as a on your own.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000 Yeah, and before I jumped on and completed your sentence for you, you were going to say relationships, right?
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000 And I was already in the combat mode if I got your back, because that's, you know, what do you, you don't, you don't tell a, a Lance Corpel.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000 Hey, you need to build a relationship. Now you say, you got to make sure they got your back, right?
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000 But if you're talking to a business, which is what we do, it's hey, you got to make sure you're building good relationships.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000 You got to make sure that they know they're going to give you that support, that mutual aid if you need it. That's what we're doing.
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000 And if we have that, we're unstoppable. If we have that, three of us can take a lion.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000 Corpel Gregory.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000 Corpel Gregory was a squad leader. This is Vietnam 1971, US Marine Corps.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000 Corpel Gregory was a squad leader assigned to the first combined unit pacification platoon, third battalion, first Marines.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000 The unit was the northern most marine unit in Vietnam. Corpel Gregory's combat experience had made him an extremely proficient infantry leader.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000 He placed strong emphasis on training in the field.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000 Where? Wait, back in the rear? Were they at plenty of time to train? No, in the field. He placed strong emphasis on training in the field.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000 He took every chance to conduct opportunity training with his Marines.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000 There were numerous duties required of Corpel Gregory squad.
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000 Each day, Corpel Gregory assembled the squad and instructed them in a single practical infantry skill.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000 I'm gonna say that again. Every day, well, we got all these duties.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000 The reason I'm saying this is, we hear this all the time from companies. We don't really have time to train. So, so guess what? No one has time to train.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000 And if you think that this Marine Corpel in the field has, quote, time to train, you're wrong.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000 So what does he do? Every day he assembles the squad and instructs them in a single practical infantry skill.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000 How long does that take? 10 minutes, five minutes, seven minutes.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000 While in a patrol base, Corpel Gregory instructed his men in such skills as helicopter medevacs,
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000 Closer support and call for fire.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000 Corpel Gregory required that his squad members continue their professional development.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Every day after returning from patrols, Corpel Gregory squad would work on their Marine Corps Institute correspondence courses.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000 PFC Kirby, a member of Corporal Gregory Squad, finished the Marine Corps NCO MCI in the field in Vietnam.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000 In the field in Vietnam, Corporal Gregory took the initiative to train his Marines in the skills required by his units mission and environment.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000 His training exceeded the basic requirements established by the Marine Corps and created a squad that was particularly well prepared for combat.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000 The Corpel used scenario-based training to run his men through multiple repetitions of probable combat situations.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:00.000 He made sure that each Marine in his squad understood their commanders intent, their role in the mission, and how each man affected the outcome of events during battle.
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000 Corporal Gregory is freaking square away.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000 By the way, everything that I'm saying right now, apply it to what you're doing in your company, in your business.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000 Think of how much you could do to help, how much you could do to train your people.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:28.000 Not because you've got two weeks allocated to train your personnel, but because you've got 20 minutes to review with them how this product works or how this piece of equipment functions or what to do in an emergency situation.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000 Or how to handle a client.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000 It was not long before Corporal Gregory's training proved vital.
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000 On the night of February 14, 1971, Corporal Gregory and his unit came under heavy attack.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000 Corporal Gregory was killed.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000 Yet, because the squad was so well trained and understood what it had, what had to be done, the squad was able to meet the challenge and skillfully engage the enemy.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000 Corporal Gregory's exemplary leadership in the weeks prior to the attack at prepared his Marines for this firefight.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000 The enemy was repulsed and the squad held its position.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:32.000 In the morning, over 30 dead NVA were found in the area surrounding the squad's position, every Marine in the squad realized that it was Corporal Gregory's training emphasis that had won the battle and saved their lives.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:46.000 Lessons. Corporal Gregory displayed outstanding initiative in training his Marines.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000 He assumed the responsibility for preparing his Marines for the demands of combat.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000 This training greatly exceeded the established standards of the Marine Corps, which by the way are no low standards.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000 And directly contributed to the combat success and survival of the unit after Corporal Gregory's death.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Corporal Gregory, and by the way, if they ended up with 30 dead NVA, over 30 dead NVA, that was a big force that attacked his unit.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000 Corporal Gregory used whatever time was available to instruct his Marines and hone their professional skills.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000 This aggressive opportunity training was necessary because few units could conduct formal training in the combat zone.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000 I talked about this on the F online the other day.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.000 I absolutely learned more from informal training than I did from formal training during my time in the Navy without questions.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000 Not even close.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000 If you were to remove all the informal lessons I learned, I would be an idiot.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000 Do you find that the formal training is like kind of sorts itself out to be more valuable early on?
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000 Explain.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 So like, you know how you have basic training, right?
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000 That's where you learn like all the formal protocols that were everyone has to essentially do the same thing under very similar circumstances.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000 And then the informal training seems to, and I'm totally just thinking about you, just to know.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000 And it work I guess, where when you get informal training, that's when you're trained up on all the basics.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000 It's kind of like college in a way, you know, you have like all these prerequisites.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000 Like hey, you guys all got to know this, this, this, this and know it good.
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000 And then later on, then maybe we'll send you out to a specific company or whatever to learn kind of what they do.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000 And then you can start to apply these things in specific situations.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:50.000 I think the example to use would be let's say you went to some kind of a technical school like being a doctor, being a mechanic, being a air conditioning repairman.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000 You're going to learn some technical stuff in the classroom, but when you really get good, it's doing the job.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000 It's when someone pulls your side and says, oh yeah, when you see this, here's the problem.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Right.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000 When you when you go here, here's what you need to do.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000 You see this symptom from a patient, here's what's actually happening.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:20.000 It's all that informal training that and maybe I'm wrong about the doctors because I don't know what medical schools like, but I can only imagine that you get a heck of a lot better.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000 By once you're in the field and you're doing surgeries and someone says, hey, here's a better way to do this.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Here's the technique and you do this there. Here's something like that.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 Yeah.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000 Yeah.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000 It's like, you know, I think it was, it was a book you're reading a long time ago where they'd have a name.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000 Should it might have been one of our guests, I don't know, but they'd have a name for the people who don't do.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000 I think it was in the army where they don't do it. They just do all the theory and they call them something like nerds or something.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Those, I don't know.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000 Anyway, but yeah, there's a people who know and they essentially, they know what to do and what the protocols are in a vacuum.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000 Once you start when you get out out there in the field and the real world kind of thing, that's where that informal like, no, this isn't by the book over here.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000 You've got to watch out for this because you know,
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000 And there's also a difference between just learning from experience, which is, hey, I did this operation.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000 Here's something mistakes that I made and all and that's just experience classroom is classroom.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000 I'm talking about in between where you're, you know, someone's pulling you inside and say, hey, Jonko,
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000 when you start to see this develop, that's not a good call.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000 Here's a call that would be better to make and here's why.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000 It's not formal training. It's my platoon chief telling me something.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.000 Yeah.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000 It's my LPO, my leading petty officer saying, hey, hey, new guy.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000 Here's what you need to do when you see that unfolding.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000 And you go, okay, Roger that. It's not formal training, but that's where you learn.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000 And it's not just experience either.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000 Experience alone would take you way longer than informal training.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000 Like how many, okay, Jjitsu example, here you learn the armlock.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000 Now we're rolling.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 Yeah.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000 And you try an armlock me and I say, hey, echo, if you, if you don't squeeze your knees together,
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000 it's really easy to get out here.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000 Put, look at me your arm, boom, oh yeah, you feel that.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000 Try and pull your arm or oh, I can't. Okay, yeah.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000 That's because it's all because I'm squeezed my knees.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000 Okay, look, the instructor guaranteed the instructor said squeeze your knees.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000 Yeah.
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000 But you need that informal assessment of your actual situation to realize,
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000 oh, I see what I need to do.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000 Yeah, exactly right. That's exactly what else I can do.
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000 Did you get it?
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000 What was the, I mean, you have to get informal training once you're in the,
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000 once you're done with the rag.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Yeah.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000 I think just how you described it.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000 The, you talked about like being on cider being in the field or doing it like that.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000 You talked about even just the interconnection of repair man.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000 What that looks like.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000 The way you described what life would be like if all we ever did was formal training,
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000 you'd have no context for anything.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000 You wouldn't even know how it applies.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000 So I think that's true.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000 And certainly in my case, in aviation,
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000 I don't think it's any different.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000 Like everything is taught by the book.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000 Everything is formal training the beginning.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000 It's all these things.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 And the many you get in the airplane and get up in the sky.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000 And you are feeling things in a different way.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000 It's really hard to apply them because you learned it on the ground.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000 And the context of the informal, hey, hey listen, look,
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000 you see that? Yeah.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000 That's what it means in the book when it says this.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000 That's what it looks like.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000 Oh, man, I would never be able to understand that from reading it in a book.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000 They have to train.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000 You have to get a translation.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Yeah.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000 You do.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000 You have to be able to see and feel it.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000 And that will not happen in formal training.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000 It's important to realize if you have some experience.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000 And you have people that are on your team.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000 The amount of knowledge that you can transfer to them is so valuable.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000 And the reason I'm pointing this out is because a lot of times you forget that.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000 You think you can do this for a long time.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000 You think it's a big deal.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000 Hey, this is just what you do.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000 You forget that you've learned all this.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000 But taking that and saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000 now come over here.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000 Let me show you some.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000 Let me show you better way to do that.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000 Let me show you a little trick.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000 It's very powerful.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000 Not to mention when you invest in people like that for 10 minutes.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000 For 10 minutes.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000 You're helping them.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 And you're building that relationship.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Which is what this whole thing is that we're talking about.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000 Yeah.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000 And I wrote down while you're talking that telling that story of that corporal is.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000 I just wrote down.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000 I always take notes.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000 It's all I do in this podcast.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000 I just take notes.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000 I take these things.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000 I write them down and I keep them.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000 And I find places where they apply.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000 And as you know, they apply everywhere.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000 And this idea of this guy training is people is actually the best thing he can do to take care of them.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 It's the best thing he can do.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000 It's the best thing any leader can do to help them.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000 Not give you a break and not give you free time.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000 And yeah, of course there's a balance there.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000 But the best thing he could do is prepare them to be in a position.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000 And I think the reason that stuck with me is that when we talk about decentralized command, which we talk about all the time,
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 when business.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000 The scenario that always plays out is the reason why decentralized command is so important is that your people have to know what to do when you're not around.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 That's pretty obvious.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000 But the scenarios are usually your on vacation.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000 You're on a different shift.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000 You've got the day off.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000 Not that you're dead.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000 So when you kind of think of it in these context that these of what he was doing is being able to prepare them to be successful.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000 That him being around is in the worst possible situation.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000 If literally him dying in that situation is the best thing he can do.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000 So so the same thing doesn't happen to them is train them.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000 Even if it's five minutes at a time.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000 That's how we kept those guys alive.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000 And that is something that you can you can translate to almost any situation.
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000 You're family.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000 You know we talk about this in the code, the protocol.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000 The evaluation.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000 It's like hey, what can you do your family?
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000 Can you give your family five minutes of training to pass on knowledge that you have?
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000 More lessons here.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000 Corporal Gregory realized that combat is a dynamic environment which takes a heavy toll on leaders within an infantry company.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000 He trained his subordinates to be able to assume his role.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 This saved the lives of his men during the chaos of battle.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:28.000 After his death the men of corporal Gregory squad performed well performed well because they had confidence in their training and in themselves a confidence that was instilled by corporal Gregory's leadership.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000 You know when we were talking when we talk about confidence how do you get confidence?
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000 You confidence to work.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000 You know when we talk about confidence by doing something.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000 You know when we talk about confidence by doing something.
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000 Doing it well doing it again doing it better doing it better.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000 That's where confidence comes from.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000 Otherwise it's false confidence.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000 Maybe I should just stop talking because the way he that was written.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Because a lot better than the way I said it.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000 Well here's what's really cool.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000 So they have a if.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000 We he mentioned he mentioned Kirby in this PFC Kirby.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Remember of the of corporal Gregory squad that finished this NCO MCI in the field.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000 We'll have a quote from him not from Vietnam from 1998.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000 And now Sergeant Major RB Kirby said the very worst night of my torn Vietnam when we were involved in a major firefight and we were losing marines.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000 Our squad survived as result of the corporal's training.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 We are alive today because of him.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000 Next one.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:44.000 Corporal Abolz British Army.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000 Foculons.
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000 1982.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000 In 1982 Argentina invaded the Foculons.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000 Foculons in the South Pacific South Atlantic Ocean.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000 The island had been British territory since British days as an imperial power not willing to give up its territory.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000 Britain sent a task force to the islands in order to reclaim them after an amphibious assault.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000 British forces pushed their way across the islands.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000 The second battalion of the parachute regiment known as two parah of the British Army was ordered to attack the Argentine forces of Goose Green.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000 It was to be the first pitched battle between British and Argentine forces.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000 The land bridge between Goose Green and the town of Darwin was the only way for forces to move between East Foculon Island.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000 And Lafonia Island.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000 If two parah could not break through to Goose Green, the British would have to spend valuable time mounting another amphibious assault of the Foculon Islands.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000 Corporal Abolz was a section leader equivalent to a squad leader in a company to parah.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000 A company's mission was to attack along the battalion's eastern flank and assault the town of Darwin.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000 On the night of 27 May 1982, two parah attacked Goose Green.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000 The Argentineans were well prepared for the attack and the paratroopers could advance only yards at a time.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000 As the sun rose, the battalion was left in a precarious position.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.000 Two parah was stalled pin down in the open by Argentinean mortar and machine gunfire.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000 A company was trapped in a crossfire between the Argentineans on Goose Green and those in Darwin.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000 This is a nightmare scenario.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000 You're in a crossfire receiving both mortar and machine gunfire.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000 Realizing that the trap could only be broken by persistent aggressive action.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000 Corporal Abolz decided to continue to lead his squad in assaulting enemy positions,
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000 seeking to break the deadlock himself.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000 The commanding officer of two parah charged the machine gun nest.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000 And we shot dead.
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000 The commander of a company kept the event quiet, not wanting to demoralize the troops,
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000 whose predicament seemed to worsen at this critical point in the attack.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000 At that moment, Corporal Abolz led an assault upon an Argentinean position.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000 He decided to fire a 66-millimeter shoulder-launched anti-tank rock that into the bunker.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000 The penetration of this rocket caused such a magnificent explosion, which was followed by silence.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000 The first flags of surrender then began to surface from the Argentinean positions.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000 The Argentineans had been demoralized by the utter destruction of this single bunker
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000 and the ruthlessness of Corporal Abolz resolved.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000 This allowed a company to turn its full attention toward Goose Green.
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000 Momentum gathered behind the British attack in the next 24 hours.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000 The parah opened the route to Lafonia Island.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000 Corporal Abolz persist in aggressiveness had broken the will of the defenders.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000 This action proved to be pivotal in a company's attack to parah.
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000 Two parah's victory at Goose Green assured a British victory for the Falkland campaign.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000 Lessons.
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000 Corporal Abolz squad level action effectively turned the tide of the battle at Goose Green.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000 This is an example of how an aggressive tactical action can have effects out of all proportion
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 to the size of the action.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000 His command decisions fully supported both his company and battalion commanders intent.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000 His spectacular assault of that particular bunker affected the morale of both sides.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000 Crush the spirit of the Argentineans and pass the initiative and momentum to British forces
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000 and prove to be the action needed to continue the British advance.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000 After this action, Argentineans soldiers began to surrender rather than die in combat.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000 One person, a corporal, makes a one move and it changes the tide of this battle.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:54.000 By the way, moments after his commanding officer was killed, heroically assaulting a machine gun nest.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.000 Corporal Abolz courage leadership and determination propelled him to persevere and achieve decisive results in extricating his unit from a desperate situation.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000 When all else fails, persevere and prevails.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000 And if you want more on the Falkland Islands, podcast 88 excursion to hell.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:27.000 Sergeant David C. Freeman, US Army, Vietnam, 1966.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000 During Operation Crazy Horse and pay attention to that name, Operation Crazy Horse.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000 We're going to go deep.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000 In the Vin van Valley in June of 1966, a company of Montenegro troops led by special forces
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000 advisors, landed at LZ Monkey for a search and destroy mission.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000 Sergeant Freeman, a member of the command element was the fourth senior man in the unit.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000 Soon after landing, the company attacked and secured a bunker complex.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000 The company suffered some casualties and a helicopter met a vac was requested.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 The company moved back to LZ Monkey with their wounded.
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000 At the LZ, the company began receiving heavy, small arms fire.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000 The command element around Sergeant Freeman was devastated.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000 The situation demanded rapid action.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000 Sergeant Freeman grabbed a radio and took command of the company.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000 He called and helicopter gunships, coordinated supporting arms, and reorganized his defenses.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000 The helicopter pilot's flying above the battle were amazed at his coolness, under fire,
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000 under Sergeant Freeman's competent command, the perimeter held all night and the enemy eventually withdrew.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Stepping up.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 Lessons, Sergeant Freeman, a well-trained NCO was prepared to lead his company in combat.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000 He knew the techniques and procedures for air support supporting arms, met a vac, and company defensive positions.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000 And knew they kind of rattle that off.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000 And one thing that the Marine Corps does really good in this manual is they hit on the fact that you got to have the skills.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000 You got to have these fundamental skills of combat leadership.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000 The technical and tactical skills of combat leadership, meaning how to call for air support,
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000 how to call for supporting arms, how to call for artillery, how to call for met a vac.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000 These are technical skills that you have to have, and they reinforce that throughout this book.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000 So if you're in a leadership position, you think, well, I'm not going to have to do that.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000 No, actually, you better go and dig in and figure out how to do these things.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:36.000 In addition to his technical knowledge, he was able to match these abilities with strong leadership and cool competence in the face of disaster.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000 Because of his experience and situational awareness, Sergeant Freeman knew that rapid action was required.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000 Once again, what do we see? We see someone that's taking action.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000 He immediately took control of the situation, making decisions and issuing orders, and extricated his company from a perilous situation.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000 And here's a little cloud squids on war, which we haven't covered yet.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000 It's sort of one of those ones.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000 Is it like not playing the obvious one? You know, I haven't done that one yet.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:29.000 The end for which a soldier is recruited, armed, and trained, the whole object of his sleeping eating, drinking, and marching is simply that he should fight at the right place, and at the right time.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000 Check. All right. Now, here we go. Here we go.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000 So this section that I'm about to read actually came earlier in the manual. I pulled it out and I put it at the end.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 This is the last one of these examples.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000 And there's a reason why. And it immediately struck me when I saw it.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000 So the title of this section is just Sergeant 1st class, US Army Vietnam, 1966.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000 So as soon as I read that, I was kind of surprised because I had all the other ones to give the person's name.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000 Something in why why why aren't they saying this guy's name?
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000 This is a top secret mission. Well, no, this is 1998. There was no no more secret missions.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:24.000 So why aren't we explaining this? It becomes obvious when I read it why they just called this individual Sergeant 1st class. So here we go.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:38.000 In May of 1966, C company of 1st Battalion, 12th Cavery, 1st Cavery Division established a mortgher fire base at LZ Harford in the Ving Fan Valley.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000 So this is actually part of and I'll get into this.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000 This is part of that earlier operation that we mentioned.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.000 The position was 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. The upper slope was covered in six foot high elephant grass.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000 The mortgher section was led by a sergeant 1st class, no name given.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000 His position lay on a hill which had previously been occupied by Vietcong Gorillos.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000 He formed his men in a weak perimeter.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:22.000 We're not off to a good start. Arrange in a U shape with the curve facing uphill and set up the mortgher's in order to provide support for the company.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000 The main body of the company went off to patrol the valley below leaving the 22 man mortar section to defend their own position.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000 The men fired off a few rounds to seat their base plates. The sergeant decided to give the men a break.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000 It did not order anyone to dig in or examine the area around the perimeter.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:52.000 No security patrols were sent out. The men lounged, eight sea rations and walked around in the open.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 In the jungle heat it seemed like a day at the beach.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.000 At 1330 an enemy machine gun opened up at a range of 50 meters from the elephant grass uphill of the mortgher position.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000 A 200 man unit of VC had been waiting to ambush the laks mortar unit.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000 Machine gun fire was followed by rifle fire and grenade attacks.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000 The rest of the company which had gone down the hill on patrol.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000 The rest of the company took 35 minutes to rush back to the devastated mortar position.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000 The enemy had withdrawn and left only a handful of dazed survivors.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000 The failure of the sergeant to properly lead his unit.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000 In force basic security measures or prepare for enemy contact led directly to disaster.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000 With its support element eliminated, the company was not able to establish its patrol mission,
00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:01.000 which in turn negatively affected the battalions mission in the Vin Tham Valley.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000 I read that and I think about what is this mean.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000 They hadn't given away any names, right?
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000 They didn't give this guy's name, but they had given away a date may of 1966.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000 They'd given away the lz, lz hair effort.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000 I started to do some research and it turns out that this battle, this specific battle,
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000 was written about in a book on Vietnam called Battles in the Monsoon.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000 This is an outer print book, but I was really curious.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000 What happened?
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000 What happened?
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000 I found this outer book, print book, ordered it.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000 The book Battles in the Monsoon is a book full of basically a bunch of short little stories.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:16.000 This particular section in this book about this battle is called Men Facing Death.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.000 So let's hear a little bit more detail about this situation.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000 By the way, this is all Operation Crazy Horse.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.000 By the night of 21 May, the Battle of Vin Tham Valley appeared to be slowing to a stop with the enemy fractionalized and everyone running for cover.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000 Well, landing zone, hair effort, that well worked over slope where the initial explosion has occurred, had occurred, and I'm skipping to this specific.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000 They give a little bit of background.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000 This lz hair effort had been used a bunch.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000 It looked like one of the safest places in the fire zone such had been the consistency of armed traffic in and out of it.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000 So this was a lz that was getting used all the time.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000 That was about how Colonel John Jay Hennessey thought of it when he decided on a special mission for Charlie Company.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000 First of the 12 for the following morning, it was a courteous gesture.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000 The main object being to return Charlie Company to its parent Battalion, but before doing so, a Hennessey plan to ask a small favor in return.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:31.000 The company under Captain Don F. Warren, a taciturn Georgian who had been with his same unit since winning his gold bars in 1961.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000 So this guy's been in the same unit since for five straight years.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000 He was on the perimeter in Hill, on Hill 766 several ridges beyond hair effort.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000 The airline distance was about 3,000 meters.
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000 Hennessey directed Warren to sweep back over the high ground to hair effort after son up.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:59.000 One worried about that passage, he was most concerned that Charlie Company should reconnoiter the lower slopes beyond the landing zone, which thus far no one had proud.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000 That taciturn it could rejoin the battalion in the valley not far away.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000 Hennessey had no reason to be suspicious. He was merely being cautious.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000 The ground around hair effort had not been worked over carefully for several days.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:20.000 Captain Jack Cummings and Alpha Company were in perimeter on the landing zone at the same hour. They were not left wholly.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000 They were not left wholly undisturbed, but the occasional sniper rounds and grenades that innoculously bitten to their ground were attributed to enemy stragglers.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000 So there's a company there. They're getting hit occasionally, but there's just a bunch of stragglers is what they're assuming.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000 Alpha Company needed to be back.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000 So they send in Charlie Company.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000 Word of that was a foot and that reached major Charles Siler at the on at on K shortly after Hennessey gave his order the divisions.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000 Public information officer was entertaining a visitor and a weighing problem all his own.
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:12.000 Relatedly drawn by the news that Operation Crazy Horse was racking up a score, war correspondent Sam Caston, a 32 year old senior editor of Look magazine had just arrived in camp pursuing a theme worthy of Hemingway.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 Caston was the only correspondent drawn to the battle.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000 He said to Siler,
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000 I wish to know the thoughts of men facing death. So that's what this war correspondent says Sam Caston.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000 Siler voiced an honest doubt that the quest was logical, men's fears and reflections not being all of one kind,
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000 and the soldier hardly knowing how he thinks about death until he feels he is dying.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000 It is just not the subject that makes for easy talk among combat men.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000 So that kind of weird, right? We got this reporter saying, hey, I want to go get some men facing death.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000 At the time General Norton had put the on K position on semi alert.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000 The whole camp was a stir, siler, and the staff were in the bunkers around the press camp, re-aligning some of the sandbags.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 You don't have to worry about this ground tonight.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000 Said Caston, I'm the luckiest reporter alive wherever I go, nothing happens.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.000 Even this guy who's looking for problems, he's got that attitude where I'm going to go look for problems and we're not going to find him.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000 Siler remembered the words, thinking them slightly ironic and view of what Caston was looking for.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000 This guy wants to go find people facing death, but then he says they don't worry about they're going to be in any problems, because I'm so lucky that nothing's going to happen.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000 There's a big hill not far from here where a lot of men have died in the last few days he said.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:43.000 Then I want to get up there first thing in the morning said Caston, and by the way I intend to follow the subject all the way through, see the coffins in which you place the bodies.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000 We put them in rubber bags, said Ciler grumbling, hoping to close the conversation,
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000 but Caston continued to fret about getting up to hair referred soon after dawn, siler broke off work to arrange for Caston's certain departure.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000 These were the circumstances which resulted in Caston being delivered to hair referred by the same helicopter that carried ammunition coffee and a hot breakfast to Cummings and Alpha Company.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000 His first hours were unrewarding that the unit was too busy stacking supply equipment for an early getaway to talk with Caston about death.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000 Besides the morning was disarmingly fair and quiet.
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:23.000 Warren and Charlie Company meanwhile were beating their way along the ridge on the way back from Hill 766, having broken camp at 100,
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:32.000 at 100, a fairly wide trail runs from the top of the scarf, the entire distance. Fast forward a little bit.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000 Alpha Company was lifted from LZ, hair referred when Charlie Company arrived at Hynoon.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:48.000 Caston stayed. On the landing zone, Warren talked briefly to Lieutenant Colonel Ruff-Rutland-Peard Jr.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000 The Battalion Commander and his S3 Major role.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000 It was arranged.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000 That Warren and the main body of the company would continue their stroll down slope through the trees and across the river.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000 Now, I just want to call out these words, it was arranged because we're going to get some more information.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:20.000 So you've got the Battalion Commander talking to the company commander and they come to, this is what it says.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000 It was arranged.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000 That Warren and the main body of the company would continue through the stroll through the down slope through the trees and across the river.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000 The mortar platoon would remain unharaford to cover its further advance with fire from the 81 millimeter tube.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000 So now you can see where we're going, the sergeant first class of the mortar platoon that we talked about from the squad leader makes a difference.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000 This is the guy.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000 This is the guy.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:02.000 The platoon 22 strong was led by Sergeant Robert L. Kirby, a 29 year old Negro from Los Angeles.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000 The light of frame, solemn face, Kirby is rated one of the stoutest, harded fighters in his brigade.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000 So that's a little different, right?
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:26.000 Now we're calling this guy one of the stoutest, harded fighters in the brigade, but in the reflections from the manual, he's not going to do a good job.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000 And by the way, they're going to get left with 22 people in a mortar platoon, which is again, we'll dive more into that.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000 Few of numbers, his men seem to sufficiently armed.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:50.000 Each carried 300 more rounds for other M16s and from two to four hand grenades, the one heavy weapon was the 81 millimeter mortar for which Kirby had only 18 rounds.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000 That with the tube was as much weight as the men could carry.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000 But efficiently armed is an interesting way of saying it.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000 Because we know that at M16 with 300 rounds and M16 is fine, a mortar is fine.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000 But if you get into a legitimate gunfight, there's something that you need called a machine gun, and you need a few of them.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000 And they don't have any.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Not good.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000 Moreover, it had been agreed that is promptly as the descending company passed beyond the range of the platoon.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000 That the platoon would be lifted out by chopper.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000 Alpha company had 100 or so mortar rounds behind Kirby reckoned he would not need them.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000 Casting the reporter had decided to stay on her referred instead of moving with the company called.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000 It's an interesting decision.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000 It's an interesting decision because if you would think if you're looking for to get in the fight, you would, oh, they're going to go with the trigger.
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000 But I'm sitting on this kind of LZ, we're kind of, it's almost like a little bit secure,
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000 and these guys are going to go on patrol. I would probably think I'm going patrol. Casting for whatever reason.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000 He says he decides to stay up there on her referred.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:10.000 And it's Kirby, the sergeant who says it will happen here if anywhere.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000 No, sorry, that's casting that says to Kirby, it will happen here if anywhere.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000 Like the working in combat, Kirby says about that, your dead wrong.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000 And he honestly felt that way though, as he looked about what he saw this position hardly
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Weren't such a serence. It was all wrong from any reason to tactical view. So now this is Kirby.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000 He's looking at the situation, even though he says, yeah, it's not going to happen here.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000 He knows it's all wrong from a tactical perspective.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000 The landing zone at Herford was by then a burned off trampled and rumple,
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000 rubble strewn about the size of a professional basketball court running length wise down the edge of a ridge.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000 It scorched earth and grasses were less apparent than the fox holes distributed more or less evenly around the oval shaped perimeter.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000 Originally these had been enemy spider holes, and were subsequently enlarged by American occupancy.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000 The trouble was that Kirby did not have enough men to round out his holding.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000 So the position became a you pointed, a you pointed up an up slope.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000 And this is where there's there you can see the similarity here from from the manual.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:22.000 The uphill open and fronting toward the high ground was not covered by weapons present since the platoon was sighting its pieces down slope.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000 The company having gone that way and weapons.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000 So they have a U shape and they're like, well, the platoon went that way.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000 So we don't really need to have much there.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000 And that's where he decided to put light, not any protection in that direction.
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000 In neither direction was the prospect of a fight was a prospect good if a fight was to be forthcoming.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:56.000 There was beauty everywhere, but there was beauty everywhere for the to sue the eye, up slope, and bordering the very edge of the defended ground was a sea of elephant grass standing six to eight feet tall.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.000 Down hill there was a shear and rocky precipice extending 30 feet and giving away to an extension in the field of tall grasses, which also invested the flanks.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Greenness was all about except where the men looked to their weapons.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000 The company took off down, so now here goes the company the company took off down the steep clutching to the rocks, creepers and creepers for balance.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000 No preparatory artillery fires or air strikes had been put on the slopes around herford because of Lawrence movement.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000 The earlier presence of Alphacompan and the all-round feeling that crazy horse operation was slowing to a halt.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000 This operation had been going on for a pretty long period of time.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000 There's been all kinds of activity. They didn't feel like they needed to do any preparatory fire for this patrol.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000 Kirby worried less about his platoon than about the movements and enterprise of caston.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000 The reporter, the men had gone to ground.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000 The correspondent was moving from position to position standing erect, taking photographs and asking numerous questions.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:00.000 Wanting to protect caston, he did not know how to object his freewheeling, though he realized that his movements were describing the limitations of the force.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000 In fact, these things little matter.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000 Caston was enjoying himself hugely. He asked Kirby, how do you feel about these things?
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000 Kirby answered, if you think you're going to get a story out of this platoon, you're wrong. Nothing will happen here.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000 Caston continued with his rounds of the perimeter, snapping pictures and asking the men, how do you feel?
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000 Kirby lost interest in caston kept moving.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000 The position of the mortar of one mortar was near the bottom of the slope LZ.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000 Just inside the U where the crew had dug a little pit.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.000 At approximately 1,300 the platoon began supporting the descending company with the fire of the 81 millimeter mortar.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:48.000 The range 800 meters, it takes a while to hack through the jungle, Captain Warren got Kirby on the radio and told him to bring it closer, which Kirby tried to do.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.000 So now you got the platoons up there, they're dropping mortars in front of the platoon that's driving through the jungle.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000 An hour later, Warren called Kirby again.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000 This time the message was an uplift, said Warren, choppers are incoming to take you out within 30 minutes.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.000 Just about done so. Just to recap, you've got the platoon, you've got the mortar platoon in this landing zone.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000 You've got the rest of the company pushed down the hill and they're just on a patrol.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000 And eventually they're so far away that there's no point in the mortar platoon being up there anymore.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000 So now helicopters are going to come grab them and take them out.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.000 30 minutes. That was what Warren and Kirby both fought, but the choppers had put down at landing zones.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000 Avoid Hennessey's command post in the valley just to make certain orders that the orders given still stood from their delay.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.000 Holy unfaltable came rocking general Jack Norton rocking the high command rocking us all.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000 Kirby got off his 17th mortar round in support of the advancing company.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000 That being the last one he fired.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000 Remember that 18 rounds. He just fired 17th round.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Then the thing happened.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000 There was no advance warning.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Sergeant Lewis Buckley and PFC Wade taste were still collecting the company water cans and other material for the flight.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000 Moving carelessly in the open even as was corresponded cast in.
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:34.000 Including Kirby stayed put in their foxholes that they did so as less a sign of their alertness than of their forthcoming operational routine.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000 Once lodged in position, they had not moved to scout its surroundings.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000 The long trek via the jungle trail had half had them half busched.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 So they're tired.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000 Over much of the distance they had to move.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000 They were crouching because the tiny overhang there was no shade where they were sprawled to sunbeat directly down on them.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000 And it was not less than 100 degrees.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000 The word was passed from hold a hole that they were returning to home base.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000 Nothing much else.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000 Not even the eccentric movements and questions of cast and interested them.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000 The hour must have been about 1330 from up slope and from not more than 50 yards away came a.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000 Came the fire of a heavy machine gun.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000 Its bullet stream was dead on the mortar.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000 The first rounds ripping through the tube as if the weapon had already been zeroed in.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Thereafter it beat directly on the mortar put pit with never a pause.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000 So came Kirby's first warning that he was engaged.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000 He yelled out fire.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000 But it was superfluous though he did not know it.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Being too close to the mortar, a split second before Kirby had reacted.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000 His own men had started the fight.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000 On the left of the inverted you it would have been the right flank.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Had these men been facing uphill.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000 Once the fire was specks four Paul Jay Harris and then Charles Stucky had seen three enemy
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000 skirmersers moving in through the elephant grass, not five meters beyond their foxholes.
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000 There m16 there m16 fire signal detection of movement to which the enemy machine gun instantly responded.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000 A swiftly as those three weapons spoke from the elephant grass on three sides of the perimeter rifle.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Fire cracked and Kirby sensed that his position was almost totally enveloped.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000 So he gets the feeling that worse around it.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000 He yelled to his radio man.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000 Speck four John F. Sprains a call company get them back where being hit.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000 As the message was relayed to Captain Warren and as he remembered it, the words were come back we're being hit.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000 Though the main body moving through the jungle was too far down the slope to get the sounds of the fight.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000 Warren had his movement of agonized, had his moment of agonized shock.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000 And that's an interesting tidbit.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 A moment of agonized shock.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Almost as if he may have expected that this would happen.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000 He knew Kirby as a thoroughly brave soldier.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000 And this is the unnamed person from the manual.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000 Two steady two seasons to be stampeded by a little random fire when he called for help the thing had to be fully desperate.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000 The confidence between the white captain from Georgia and the Negro sergeant from California was complete.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000 So these guys had trust.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:35.000 Wasting not an instant Warren called back on the radio to attend Robert McClillin of first platoon,
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000 bringing up the rear of the far stretch column, get your ass back up that hill.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000 All hands reversed and started scrambling upward, men clutching at rocks, tearing their palms on foreign vines,
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000 sliding, falling and panting and desperate effort to race up the steep.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000 All did not fully understand the reason why there was no attempt to observe security.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Had they been without knowing moving into an ambush the disaster that too soon followed could have been even greater.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000 Far above them on the slope of hairford, men who still moved,
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000 crouched below to escape the sheet of fire beating from all sides.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000 Most of Kirby's men had died in the first 10 minutes, though he did not know that yet.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000 The return fire from his people grew steadily fainter.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000 Sergeant Isaac Johnson, a 27-year-old Negro, had been sitting with a plat board at the mortar pit when the fight began.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000 He heard someone yell they're coming out of the woods.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000 In his agitation he tried to turn the mortar around to fire it up hill, not even noticing that it had been drilled through.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000 The incoming fire was too great and his strength too little.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000 So he slithered up on his belly to the left flank and dropped into a foxhole.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:52.000 He could see 40 to 50 men at a run out of the trees into the elephant grass where he lost sight of them.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000 They were partially camouflaged in their shirts where of all colors.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000 Looking down how hill he saw many more of the enemy moving through the grass.
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000 Some crawling others hunched over firing as they moved in.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000 It came to him as a sudden idea that he should fire too.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000 He thought he thought as he fired he had dropped at least four enemy skirmishers with his M16.
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000 So by the way, I mean we're already talking about a totally outnumbered force.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000 This in one flank he sees 40 or 50 bad guys.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.000 From the next foxhole above him, PFC Henry Benton and Joe L. Tomato were ultimately firing up slope and downhill.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000 Helling as they pulled the trigger Johnson saw his last of them when he ran out of ammunition and crawled back to the mortar pit in search of a magazine.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000 Inside the pit there were four men heads down.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000 The enemy machine gun and at least two automatic rifles were bearing directly on the hole and smashing its rim.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000 Johnson could not be sure whether the men were ducking or dead.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:06.000 Sergeant Buckilloo, Paul Buckilloo, 22 years in the army was having his first go in combat.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.000 The opening barrage cracked him wide open. He bolted straight across the perimeter, vanished into the elephant grass and was never heard from again.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:25.000 Sergeant Johnson couldn't find his spare magazine so he picked up an M16 with 15 rounds in it from the dead hand of Sergeant Edward Shepherd, who had no business being there that afternoon.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Though he ranked Kirby and might have taken command, he was overdue to be lifted out by chopper for an appearance before a promotion board.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000 So he passed up the honor and died inconspicuously from a bullet through his brain.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:50.000 Another long time soldier under fire for the first time he had stayed motionless petrified by personal terror as boundless as the horror exploding all about him.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000 His 15 bullets gone, Johnson crawled toward the mortar pit screaming, come out, you'll all be killed.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000 There was no response. It was minutes too late for that. The hole held four corpses.
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000 Heads bashed in by bullet fire.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:13.000 In the nearby hole with Kirby was another bloody welter, a rocket. The Russian made p40 round of so slow of motion.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000 At the Ieasley Falls, the trajectory came arcing in dead center of the mark. Kirby sought in flight and yelled, watch out.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000 So did his foxhole mates.
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:36.000 Spectre for Austin, Eldrumman and David S. Crocker, who cried warning in the same split second. Before any man could move the rocket exploded just to the left of the hole. Crocker died instantly from a shard that crushed in his skull.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000 Drumming took heavy fragments and left arm and left egg. Leg.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:50.000 Such gouts of blood spouted from him that Kirby, who had taken four pieces of steel in his head, but remained conscious knew that Drumming couldn't not last long.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:04.000 In physical torment, Drumming tried to rise. Kirby pulled it in. Drumming screamed, let me go. I'm hurting.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000 Kirby pulled him down within a minute he died under Kirby's body.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000 Blood from Kirby's paint was streaming into his eyes, but the little sergeant could still see and think.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:29.000 He yelled to his RTO, Spectre for Sprainsa, call company, say I'm being hit by mortars and rockets. We got to have gunships and Arty.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.000 Sprainsa did his part, Captain Warren struggling uphill, remembered this piece of the message coming in. We're hit by rockets and mortars.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:53.000 He later could, later he could not recall that Sprainsa had also asked for gunfire and air artillery. But anyhow, he relayed that message to the command capsule at LZ Savoy and Sprainsa got the word back from him. It's on the way.
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:07.000 Those words find words, right then communication between the company and Paltoon ended. Both radio has worked. The mass of the originals intervened.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:23.000 They were using radio, they work when you can see them. They work a line of sight. They don't work. Whatever the terrain was, they kind of dip down the terrain and all the sudden they lost communications.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000 At that moment, the front men in Warren's column were halfway back to Harraford.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:39.000 They got double-dwarnts anxiety, though he was already doing everything possible. He had asked that artillery replaced on the slopes alongside the perimeter, not on Harraford itself.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:47.000 For Kirby had passed on nothing about casualties and Warren was still thinking of 22 live men holding the contested ground.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:57.000 The double-time climb had begun to slow from sheer exhaustion. Men stumbled, dropped in their tracks, were pulled to their feet by their mates and reeled upwards again.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000 Warren realized now that if he continued the pressure, the company would reach the scene of the fight deadbeat.
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000 About that, he no longer gave a damn.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Passing information on the radio is so freaking important and so hard.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:30.000 But if you always think that you're trying to paint a picture for the person on the other end, you've got to think that way. They don't know what's happening.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:40.000 If you've got casualties and if you can give any additional information, now look. Obviously these guys are in such a horrible way.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000 But that's what's happening. That's what's happening. He doesn't know that anyone's been wounded. He has another one's been killed.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:02:00.000 He thinks that they're in that position and he's saying, hey, start to put artillery on the outskirts of the LZ.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:17.000 The sounds of the struggle had not carried to LZ Savoy in the distant valley bottom. The control point was a throb partly because of Warren's call for help. Still more because of the monitoring of the conversations between eyewitnesses who were viewing the fight from platforms directly overhead.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:31.000 What they saw and what they said in no way less than the confusions. Colonel Beard. So this is the interesting thing about Vietnam is that a lot of times there would be aircraft because they had air superiority for the most part.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:45.000 There would be helicopters that would just get up, CNC helicopters, command and control helicopters that would just get up and fly around and be watching this stuff. I have a friend whose dad was in Vietnam and he was a silver star recipient.
01:02:45.000 --> 01:03:02.000 The whole thing was photographed. This whole event, you know, there was a gunfight broke out and his dad sort of jumped into a a diekin and then crawled along and flanked the enemy and the whole thing. It pictures the whole thing is, but that tells you what it's like.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:14.000 What do you got to do? Look, I got all sorts of things going on in my head right now. This is a brutal scene that you're reading. This whole thing is it's playing out and describing these different things is brutal.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:33.000 Because we already know we know the outcome and I'm describing these little pieces. But when you're talking about the inability for the and I think it's the company commander. That's kind of Warren Warren's trying to visualize was going on with with Kirby and his in his platoon.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:47.000 When you when you was a leader get something in your head when you kind of create what you think is the outcome when you when you get comfortable with what you think you know the outcome or the situation is and you sort of solidify that it's really hard to change that.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:07.000 So if I picture this guy leaving and there's just complacency slipped into all these comments that you've read through these little pieces of complacency of. Yes, not going to happen. Yeah, I know it's going on. This is my best guy or all those little pieces are helping this guy warns solidify in his mind what he thinks is is going on.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:21.000 And it's impossible for him and the part that I'm connecting to on my mind is how hard it is to for him to visualize things are nowhere near what you think they are and he can't get it in his head that this whole thing has been wiped out his best guys getting over run.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:40.000 And when you in your own mind predetermined the way the outcome is going to be it makes you so much less flexible and adaptable and incapable of maneuvering the way you need to and you know it's all on retrospect. I'm just thinking myself.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:51.000 You don't presume how this is going to go. Yeah, it's one of the worst things you can do and you can you can almost hear this guy's brain struggling trying to accept what's going on.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000 So it's interesting that you bring that up and as we start to hear more sides of this story.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:13.000 This guy warns who's he doesn't really know he knows that his guy is a good guy and that he's calling for help and it says that's enough for him to realize that there's something really, really bad.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:28.000 There's a panic. There's a panic of hey, like you know if you call me Dave you're on the on the else you call me a hey, John, I need to put right now. I'll be like, okay, hey guys listen, we're going to start taking the they almost immediately go into.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:41.000 So get your ass back up he's literally says get your ass back up the hill now. So there's a level of. Let's say urgency that he gets to almost immediately.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:06:01.000 We peeled this onion back. You're going to see that you're right, but the picture that he's painted is what's happening he knew something was going to go wrong. And as soon as it starts to happen, he's like, get back up there because he didn't feel comfortable with it.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000 It's like you said it's just freaking awful. Yeah.
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:24.000 Back to the book Colonel Beard, the Battalion commander, Major Roll, his S3 and Captain Robert offer artillery liaison where at the brigade CP when the news came in. They took off in a Huey to view the fight from above.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:44.000 This is a cat worth would get on the ground just kind of FYI just said everybody knows hack worth would get in the helicopter. He land. When it made sense obviously. Before they could reach the scene out of sheer happenstance, major auto can trail the Battalion executive officer of 112 was already hovering above it.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:07:12.000 So he's flying in the area. He arrived at the opposite peak when he heard Warren's voice in the earphone saying that a platoon was being overrun on herford. So Warren didn't know that the platoon was being overrun at this point. So he flew to station directly above and began orbiting low enough to see people milling around and firing on the ground below him. Cantrell was yet too high to determine whether they were friend or enemy.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:30.000 Then it william D. Fessendend. An artillery observer in another age 13 had flown the same way and was circling near Cantrell. He asked Cantrell. Sir can I bring in fire? Cantrell replied, no, I can't tell where our people are. Cantrell then flew lower.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:42.000 And about that time, beard the Battalion commander and his party arrived. They could see 40 or more men pressing close to the perimeter. They must be VC called beard.
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.000 Either that replied Cantrell or GIs with uniforms soaking wet.
01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:02.000 So this is a I know it seems crazy to think that you couldn't tell the difference between you know American soldiers and Viet Kong. I'll tell you when you're in a helicopter and you're looking at things on the ground. It is not obvious.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:23.000 And you don't need to be miles away. You can get 50, 60, 70 feet away and things get really hard to tell what's going on. I was I learned this. I was up at found and we were calling in helicopters to pick us up. And I'm sitting there. I'm standing you know the terrain in found Nevada is not there's no trees is just dirt.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:33.000 And we're standing there and the helicopter I'm sitting there looking at the helicopters. It's like the wind is hitting you. That's our close it is and they can't see me.
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.000 And I was just like what do you mean you can't see me I'm waving. They're like who coming around we'll come back around we can't and so I had to get out the red smoke or the orange smoke or whatever.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:53.000 We are violet smoke because red smoke was emergency. I think I tried to orange. Orange panel wasn't big enough.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:07.000 So that's where these guys are at back to the book his words his words merely aggravated doubts all around can trails troubles that he simply could not make himself believe that one whole American platoon had been wiped out.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:17.000 There and he was right now this is where what you were talking about you have this idea how could a whole American platoon get wiped out.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000 And it says in the book you're there and he was right and it is right why.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:39.000 When we'll get to this later this American platoon look 22 guys is not a platoon right that's not a platoon you think of a platoon you think of multiple machine gunners you think of 40 guys.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:53.000 And he dropped to 100 feet for one swift pass the phenomenon of those few seconds doubled his perplexity on the ridge crest above hair furtive saw company of men and dark suits marching to marking marching to the to the fire.
01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:12.000 And he was breaking into the landing zone can't trail out no way of knowing that these were enemy rocket rounds not American rounds coming from other bases the dark suit and men up slope he identified as enemy he knew that he knew that camouflage rig which from a distance made made them to him look like so many turtles.
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000 But where were the Americans if not on hairford.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:34.000 Friendly voice on his FM radio please please you must hurry. They was sprains of getting off his last message but can't trail had no way of knowing that either beard viewing from the same height was for a moment equally in the dark from the start of the fight with good reason curbion forgotten cast in.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:48.000 Correspondent he remembered only when cast and slid into his position to ask when are we going to get the hell out of here. Curbied in answer then cast and said I've got to have a weapon.
01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:07.000 Curbied silently handed him his own 357 magnum. Quiet now he briefly fitted into the whole beside curbied. He spoke only once to say sergeant shepherd is dead so now cast in the reporter is in the fox hole and he's got a 357 magnum.
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:24.000 All curiosity about the thoughts of men facing death was gone from cast and he had been eagerly questioning shepherd when the first shots were fired that that soldier's swift moral collapse and sudden death were his first shot contact with the realities which mocked his quest.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:37.000 While cast and opening words to curbied wrinkled they also rang a bell almost anywhere seemed to be better than the exposed ground to which the survivors clutched now under a dust Paul kicked up by the grazing fire.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:58.000 The fight had been going somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes and the fire was vastly becoming wholly one sided. Next to curbied's position the enemy skirmishers crawling through the elephant grass were not more than 15 feet away. The fire buildup suggested they were bunching probably for a rush. Curbied saw them fleetingly and vaguely as through a haze.
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:10.000 The flash of an arm of the bobbing of a head curbied got off three hand grenades and that direction is rapidly as he could throw the explosion seemed to damp the close up fire but not for more than 60 seconds.
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:22.000 In this moment of decision curbied did not doubt that the ring had been closed and that all the skirmishers waited on the lower slope amid the tall elephant grass between him and the company poised for the kill.
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000 This sitting there thinking okay worse around it and I know the company is down the hill but there's bad guys in between us.
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:41.000 Still he yelled out let's make it. With that he rolled out of his hole and down the slope cast and jumped from the hole just ahead of him and was running upright and in the clear.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:52.000 PFC Bob tastes and spec for AV spikes from the fox hole above curbied went past curbied one rolling the other sprinting then sprans a dashed by him.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000 As he rolled curbied thought he glimpsed Isaac Johnson off to his left firing two m16s.
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000 He was wrong about that. Johnson had heard someone not quite echoing curbied.
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.000 He should have moved down the hill. His own weapon was empty. He paused briefly to pick up another only to find it in like condition.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000 Curbied seen him in that fleeting second when he clutched two useless pieces before throwing them both aside.
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:28.000 Johnson's face was already a bloody mask from three superficial grenade wounds. Such was his tension. He knew you're heard the blast of the grenade nor knew that he had been hurt.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:37.000 Now in panic because he was unarmed he made a running dive at the rocky embankment giving him getting him off her referred lowers side.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:49.000 Then he rolled on and on down slope till his body could take no more beating in that spinning descent he covered 150 meters of rock stream trail.
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:59.000 Then in where he stopped a twisting V shaped cleft and the ridge back gave off to the left along this slit that trickled the stream no water in the palm of Johnson's hand.
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000 He crawled into the bed of it 20 yards or so to where the jungle growth stopped them. Then he gathered bushes and vines down around him and lay with his face flat in the water.
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000 So he's hiding.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:21.000 Dov off a freaking cliff fell down 150 meters and now he's hiding in this little ravine not too far above in the ordeal of the other few survivors continue to grow worse.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000 Of this Johnson felt and remembered nothing. Thought paralyzed by the grip of exhaustion.
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000 He had closed his mind to the sounds.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:42.000 Getting out separately some running others rolling Kirby's men had stayed that way during the first few yards of flight through the short grass just off the LZ coming to the rocky steep.
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000 They began to converge toward the center.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000 Wence the trail ran downhill. It is always so with men against fire.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:00.000 Fear and herd instinct brings them together which is the worst which is the worst thing that can happen since it just shapes up a broad target.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:10.000 Sprainsa was the first to get it as they approach the steep Kirby still rolling others crawling cast and standing.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000 I'm hit. Sprains a yelled and screamed like a panther.
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:25.000 Three bullets one in each leg and one in the head but marvously he still lived and now he was erect and walking cast and the reporter yelled back.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000 Hell everybody's hit. That was news to the others cast and taking a bullet in one arm and several grenade frags in the back saying nothing.
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000 In his last moments the correspondent had the courage of a lion. Here was a man and they knew it.
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:51.000 Spikes yelled I'm hit. It was a bullet through the right arm. They then moved 20 feet down the rock bank when sprans a yelled again. Hold it up. They're in front of us.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:00.000 Expecting it would come Kirby froze right where he was cast and kept moving in long strides straight to the trail which led downhill through the elephant grass.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:14.000 He had made up his mind and Kirby did not bow their dish out of warning standing clear on the trail was an enemy shoulder rifle aimed Kirby heard a scream as cast and went down.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:29.000 Though casting was not 15 yards from him he could not see the fall as the body was enveloped by the sea of grass. He heard the whack of the bullet and the thump of the body the bullet had drilled cast and through his left temple.
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:40.000 Cast and personal effect were looted as soon after he fell. The camera films and purse were later recovered from the bodies of the enemy in the fight that soon followed.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:57.000 Many of the next of kin get not even that grain of comfort. It is an agonizing matter for the commanders having to explain why the dead soldiers most prized possessions and pictures cannot be returned.
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:06.000 Kirby could now hear enemy soldiers moving up slope toward him. They're chattering the clang of metal from their weapons being worked.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000 He was down on his haunches and so were sprains of spikes and taste. None was firing.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:22.000 There only thought was to hide in the grass which rose to feet taller than a standing man. They all new taste was slowly dying. Two bullets in his neck. Multiple mortar shards in his back.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000 Though conscious he made no complaint only asking for water of which there was none.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:37.000 The skirmershers were moving up now and beating the grass on both sides of them Kirby saw seven of them coming right toward him not ten feet away.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000 And he knew he was discovered. He still held an M79 grenade launcher, so did spikes.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:53.000 They fired right together and the blast killed five of the enemy. The other two crawled away leaving blood trails. Another skirmershershers closed in from the left spring.
01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000 The ground between them with automatic pistol. Kirby had his M79 croaked in his arm. He had just taken another bullet through the right wrist and was feeling the wound.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000 The skirmershershers came on and looked through the grass straight at them. Spikes fired his M79. The range was so short that the grenade didn't arm.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000 But the sheer velocity it blew the man's head off.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:24.000 Had it armed, it would likely killed both spikes and Kirby. A second VC closed in from the left only to turn his back as he almost stumbled over them. Kirby killed a metter range of five feet.
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:34.000 Together two more groups closed in on them from the right and left. Kirby took two hand grenades from Spraenza, who by now was wholly down and throwing them in both directions with his wounded arm.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000 He drove them off. He had no impression of how many he had killed or whether he had even him scored a hit.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000 He simply knew that they had faded back, easing the immediate pressure momentarily.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:56.000 While this deadly hide and seek game went on down slope, Harraford LZ was being pounded by 105 and 155 millimeter Howard Cers from the valley bases.
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000 Colonel Beard had called for it from his perch aloft and still earlier when worn asked for it.
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:14.000 Whether it might have been brought in sooner and done any good is an open question. There was no right moment for its use until the Americans declared away, which movement could only be guessed that.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000 Now it had come and the perimeter was being cratered.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:27.000 One of the effects was to drive more of the enemy to the grass field lower down where Kirby and his mates crouched. The game was still on.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:37.000 From down slope, a machine gun opened fire and skydred the grass beside them. Kirby went flat in the nick of time and the bullets is being directly over his head. Spikes didn't make it.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000 One burst caught him in the head. The sound was enough. Kirby, two feet from him, didn't have to look to know he was dead.
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000 And he did not wish to look.
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000 Kirby crawled down slope about 10 feet now looking for a weapon.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:02.000 Thinking that the enemy might have dropped one. No luck. He was wholly out of ammunition and had no arm left but a flare pistol.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:13.000 So we lay flat on his back wondering what to do. Another skirmisher came up. Part of the grass and looked directly down on him. Kirby rolled over on his side and the same motion fired his flare pistol upward.
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:23.000 The rounds smashed into the glaring face not three feet above him. Getting him right between the eyes. The body was spun completely over by the blast with the figure kicking.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:34.000 Kirby did not wait to see more than that. He crawled back the way he had come to get sprainsa. The impulse was that if he had to die he would rather not be alone. Both men were silent now.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000 There was nothing to say.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:46.000 Time it about run out. They thought they were the only survivors though. This they were slightly wrong. Johnson was still face down in his private cleft.
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Spectre four Charles Stucky who swift reaction had started the fight had moved obliquely to the others and getting away from the perimeter.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000 Hidden in the tall grass alongside the knob. He had rare fortune.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000 Until the final minutes he came under a grenade shower.
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000 The blast of the survivors to get hit.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:15.000 Directly towards Kirby and Sprainsa. Another enemy group moved down the slope. Kirby didn't wait for them. Having nothing to fire he crawled upward through the elephant grass.
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000 Leaving Sprainsa and passing the skirmishers undetected.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000 They fairly stumbled across Sprainsa. He played dead. His head being gory from a bullet that had entered his left ear and emerged through his nose.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000 It is less remarkable that the deception worked than that he stayed conscious and was capable of thought.
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000 They rolled them over, searched his pockets, took his wallet knife and cigarettes and continued on.
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000 Having gone inert, Sprainsa stayed that way. Kirby had no sense of the barraging of her referred.
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000 Though the fire had been going on all of ten minutes. Now as he crawled upward he heard at last heard the explosions and knew what they were.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000 That determined him. He would crawl to the fire and try and hug it.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000 Two thoughts weren't his mind. Charlie will get his far away from this as possible.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000 And if he had to die that was still the preferable risk.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000 Halfway back to the perimeter. His ear told him that the shelling and suddenly ceased.
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000 Not knowing what that meant. He still crawled on. It was a tortured, most labored movement.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000 As his last reserve of will and strength was draining away he got within six feet of the first foxhole before he looked up.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000 What he saw almost numbness senses and he felt as if he would faint.
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000 Sitting in the foxhole pointing M16 directly at his head was PFC Morgan of First Platoon.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:49.000 He crawled a few more feet forward, still prone, looked around. Every hole at hairford was occupied by an American.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000 Captain Warren and the company had returned to the hill.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000 Sergeant Owen L. Lewis and James W. Edwards came over to help Kirby to his feet.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000 No words pass between them.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000 They were not merely choked up. They were sobbing convulsively.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000 And seeing them Kirby knew tears for the first time that day.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000 Later Warren said if my men cried it was because they were so damn mad.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000 Kirby knew better than that. They were burning morning the death of the platoon.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000 Kirby told them where to look for sprains and not knowing that the company had found them on the way up.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000 Or that he'd already been evacuated from hairford by the chopper.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000 Stucky appeared about that moment and he and Kirby were phoned on Kay aboard the same Huey.
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000 It was some time later that Johnson came in. When the hill went quiet he started crawling upward.
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000 Coming to the tall grass he saw his friend, Sergeant Wallace W. Hood standing in the clear on the forward edge of hairford.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000 And that sight brought him to his feet.
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000 Days later he was still in the state of shock. Kirby taken to the hospital of his own choice.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000 Return to the company duty within ten days still convollescent.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:12.000 On Mike Johnson he was fully coherent with his emotions under tight control to the smoke of seeing the company in tears.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000 Warren in the company had made that frantic uphill climb to hairford in exactly thirty five minutes.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000 They descend over the same trail of taking them an hour longer.
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:33.000 If a record march it was too little avail. They saw dead Americans in all but six fock holes and fought at first sprains.
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000 It was the only survival survivor.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000 The platoon weapons had been taken. Everybody had been stripped of personal effects.
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000 Warren deployed two of his platoons for a six hundred yard sweep to the eastward along both flanks of the ridge.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000 The hunt proved almost barren of result. Though blood trails were numerous and heavily marked.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000 Only five bodies were found and they all too obviously had been feld by artillery.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000 The fanatics must have hauled away larger count of dead than was lost to the company.
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000 So in the end they departed as they had come more suddenly.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000 Then mysteriously how the trap had been sprung was easy enough to figure out in retro-spect.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000 This enemy force of about two hundred was much too fresh to have followed in along Warren's wake.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000 As he came over the trail from hill seven sixty six the time intervals not long enough to have permitted a cent from lower levels.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000 Toward which Warren had kept moving. If there had been an assembly and movement still no sound had been detected.
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Last the enemy's main weapons were sighted dead on target.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:54.000 Thus the enemy force must have been there all the time. Some yards off the trail and along the ridge sides as Warren's column had walked through.
01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000 Had Warren stayed in full strength on her referred there might have been no fight.
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:17.000 He carried out his orders of that came the most melancholy episode in operation crazy horse.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Now you may have noticed that I didn't mention the author of this book that I'm reading.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000 The reason I didn't mention the author of this book is because I didn't want to cloud your impression.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000 The author was a guy by the name of SLA Marshall.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:52.000 And I talked about him on podcast 142 where we covered his book, Medigins Fire, you heard him use that phrase in here.
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:59.000 And SLA Marshall was a famous military man.
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:07.000 And he ended up being a general. He was a historian. He was a writer. He was a reserveist.
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000 So he was a civilian writer and wrote a bunch of articles. It was work for a newspaper.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:23.000 He was also a very controversial figure and hackworth. Tor did a tour with him in Vietnam and kind of reveals the guy's character. He was very e-cautistical.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:33.000 And he also made claims about his experiences in war that were not true.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:43.000 He lied about his experience. He lied about his combat experience in World War I.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:54.000 And then he also wrote in a way that supported his own theories and his own hypotheses.
01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000 And in Medigins Fire, there's a lot of people that went back and broke down what he wrote in that book.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000 On this podcast, like I said, because we didn't want to throw away the baby with the bath water.
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000 But there's a lot of things that were very controversial and some of them just straight up wrong.
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000 And on top of all that, he never let the truth get in the way of a good story.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.000 So when I read this portion of battles in the monsoon, this was on my mind.
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:40.000 And the article, I mean, this book didn't paint Kirby in such a bad light as the manual did, which made him just sound like a complete, you know,
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:48.000 Lacks a days ago guy that just let all the stuff go and didn't have any discipline and didn't follow any good protocols.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:57.000 But at the same time, I'm reading this book thinking, well, you know, SLA Marshall, he's not necessarily a guy that's going to, he just wants a really good story.
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:06.000 So he's in my opinion, and just based on the things he's written in the past, this isn't something, this isn't a reliable source either.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:16.000 Even though he would go and interview people, like those quotes he's going to, he would interview people absolutely, but still he's going to, he's going to make that story kind of the way he wants it.
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.000 And so I was still not satisfied with the information that I had in front of me.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000 And so I did some more research, and I found another article.
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000 And I found an article on a website called historynet.com.
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000 And there's an article written by a guy named Michael Christie.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000 So Michael Christie enlisted in the Marine Corps out of high school.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000 And then he joined the army.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:56.000 They became an officer, probably went to college, came an officer served in the fifth special forces group in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:05.000 And in 1970, he was the commander of C company, first battalion, 12th cavalry regiment.
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:13.000 The very same company involved in the battle at L. Z. Herford. So he wasn't there, but you know, you're going to have some connection to you.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000 We'll put some things together. You're going to hear some backfill.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000 And he eventually retired and became a writer and he produced a bunch of documentaries.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000 And then he made a series of leadership videos for the 4th of the military.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000 So the military hired him to make leadership videos.
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000 Some of those were hosted by Lee Marvin, which is pretty cool.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000 But he wrote this article.
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.000 And this article is called Last Stand at L. Z. Herford.
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:55.000 Soldiers shield themselves as best they can from the dirt and debris stirred up by a hewie, squeezing into tight one ship landing zone around noon.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000 The pilot touches down in two officers jump from the helicopter and land in a large mud puddle.
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:12.000 One GI chuckles, pokes his buddy and laughs quietly at the officers in fresh jungle fatigues stamping the mud off their polished boots.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000 A dirty unshaven captain greets them wearing torn jungle fatigues and mud covered boots, toting in M16.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000 So there's one.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:30.000 So now we're starting to get a little better picture. You know, you've got the stereotypical sort of officers rolling in with their
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000 brand new fatigues and polished boots and outcomes.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:41.000 Warren, who's been out in the jungle now for a while on this just this operation.
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000 The trio moves to the edge of the landing zone where towering elephant grass offers a bit of protection from the early afternoon sun.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000 The major unfolds of map and the three begin discussing a mission within minutes.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000 There's strong disagreement over the plan.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:08.000 Lieutenant Colonel Rutland Beard, commander of the first battalion, 12th Cavalry, first cavalry division, and his operations officer Major William Roll are insisting that Captain Don Warren,
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000 Charlie Company commander, leave his 20 man mortar platoon alone on landing zone,
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:27.000 and then move down the steep precipice toward the valley below.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000 Warren is equally insistent on keeping at least one rifle squad behind to provide security.
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:40.000 Sir, my mortar platoon is down to half strength because of malaria and has only M16s and a couple M79s.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000 The first time I'm going to have a gun force security.
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:52.000 Beard tells Warren that the mortar platoon will be on the hill for less than an hour before it will be lifted out and taken to another LZ.
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Warren's eyes lock on Beard's.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000 Anything can happen in hours, sir.
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000 Eritated at Warren's near-in-subordination.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:09.000 Beard warns, Captain, if you don't do as I order, you will be in more trouble than you can imagine is that understood.
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000 Warren has a date to moment before answering, Tursley, yes Colonel, will that be all sir?
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Beard indicates, yes, and Warren spins on his heels and walks over to his rifle platoon leaders to pass the orders.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:28.000 Beard takes a sideward glance at Roll, shakes his head, and returns to his helicopter.
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000 So, all automatically we see where this is going.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.000 By the way, look, I love this book. The squad leader makes a difference.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.000 But the squad leader's getting put in a bad situation right now.
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000 Warren has every reason for concern about the safety of his understrength mortar platoon.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000 Herifords topography makes it nearly impossible for even a fully armed rifle company defendant from a determined enemy.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.000 It is a small saddle, 165 yards, long by 45 yards. Why this partially encircled by Paul Taule,
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000 I'll have to grasp beyond the elephant grass, it's completely surrounded by rugged unforgiving landscape.
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:17.000 The most hostile being the steep Razor-back, Rajeline, reaching northeast toward a towering mountain near the near-lea thousand feet high at the base of the ridge.
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000 Herifords northern boundary begins to slope gently downhill.
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:29.000 Herifords are on explaining what we already know. Herifords is also the center of fierce fighting that began seven days early on May 15.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000 So, now they give a little background to this whole operation crazy horse.
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:43.000 When word of that battle filtered down to first cavalry leaders, they then decided the next day to conduct their major operation in the area.
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000 And that's what they're doing. Sitting on the edge of his foxhole on LZ Heriford.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000 Staff Sergeant Robert Kirby watches as Captain Warren leads three platoons from his rifle company off the mountain and down a steep slope in search of the enemy.
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000 When the last man disappears over the rim, Kirby checks his watch, it's 140 pm less than 45 minutes.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:13.000 His mortar platoon is to be airlifted, off-hair referred to LZ Savoy, where it will continue providing fire support for Charlie Company.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000 To ask occupy a company size defensive perimeter with only 19 men.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000 So now we're talking company size perimeter. That's 150 people. Yeah, he's got 19 guys.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000 Kirby figured the best way to do this was to form a U-shaped defense and place two men into every third foxhole.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000 This however, left the top of the horseshoe open.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:46.000 Knowing his men are spread to thin, Kirby, a 29 year old native of South Los Angeles, scans the perimeter from his foxhole at the bend of the hershoe beginning.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:56.000 With the gun crew directly behind him inside the pit is Sergeant Charles Gaines and Spectre for Austin, drumming a former golden gloves champion with fast hands,
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000 Perfect for dropping rounds into a mortar tube, Sergeant Isaac Johnson sits on the ground nearby with a potboard on his lap.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000 The one crew is ready to place supporting fire, went and wear the company commander.
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000 Needs it.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000 Most of the mortar platoon have been together since fort-bending Georgia, but a few are replacements who have never been in battle.
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000 So Kirby has no idea how will they react on their fire.
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000 One of his new men is Spectre for David Crocker, a 21 year old medic who sits a few feet from Kirby reading a paper back.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000 His medical bag ready at his side. In the foxhole next to Kirby is longtime a radio operator Spectre for John Spraenza.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000 Who is the platoon's linked to the outside world and is never more than an arms length away from Kirby communications are unreliable because the high mountains in deep valley.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000 How's the combo ask Kirby so far so good answer Spraenza, but who knows from how long Kirby focuses on the western section of the perimeter.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000 Holding down the most forward position at the top of the open horseshoe are two men who have fought bravely in previous firefights.
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:10.000 Private Solani sleepy Williams, who's deep sleep often resulted in heavy snoring and clearance Gomer Braim, a good natured hillbilly who looked and acted like TV's Gomer pile.
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:23.000 Two empty fighting positions below them are combat vets, Robert radar, rotor and PFC Harold Mac Jr. in a fierce firefight a few months before Kirby had been wounded and pinned down.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:31.000 When 18 year old rotor ignoring heavy fire ran out and pulled him to safety, Mac and rotor have been close friends ever since airborne school.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000 So we didn't know that about Kirby that Kirby's been in combat he's been wounded and he's still out there doing his job.
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000 This guy has combat experience and I want to think that he's going to be an accidental in this scenario.
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:58.000 In the last defensive position on the western side Kirby assigned a competent and respected leader Sergeant Lewis Buckley with PFC Henry Benton who joined the platoon only two weeks ago Kirby knows little about Benton and the two new privates covering the southern sector a few yards away from Kirby's position.
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000 Joel Tamayo and James Francis Brooks Jr. both of whom joined the platoon just a few weeks earlier.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000 So he's got those guys that he doesn't really know too well kind of close to hand. Kirby decides to walk the eastern side of the perimeter.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000 But before he goes he tells Buckley to collect and stack water cans food containers and other equipment and preparation for the helicopter pickup.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000 Roger that, Sarge says Buckley as he springs into action.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000 As Kirby walks away he hears sprans a take call.
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000 Take the first call for reconnaissance fire and advance the company's movement in the valley below.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000 So why is Kirby walking the perimeter because he's doing his job as a leader?
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:42.000 And he's also prepping to leave because when you when the helicopters come in, is it that the good time to stack up stuff and get it off the DZ?
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:51.000 The LZ? No, you want to have it prepped. So the helicopters don't spend a bunch of time there and you want to get all the stuff off the LZ so the enemy can't use it.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:04.000 Sitting in the nearest position to Kirby Kirby's on the eastern sector is spec for AV spikes who is complaining about something to PFC Wade taste.
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000 Spike stop bitching and keep your eyes open.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000 Warn's Kirby as he approaches.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000 Spike's 26 to 7 year veteran who's disregard for authorities well known looks at Kirby but says nothing.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000 Kirby orders 18 year old taste to help Buckley who's already picking up scattern cans and containers.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000 So he's stopped bitch and he can keep your eyes open.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000 This is what a platoon sergeant should be doing.
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.000 Kirby moves the next position where look magazine correspondent Sam Cassen is interviewing
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000 spec for Daniel Post and PFC Roger Robert Benjamin.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000 Cassen came out of the field a day before to write a story about death.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000 He had chosen to stay on her referred with a more to Patoon rather than travel with company Post known as
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:51.000 Patoon's practical joke or feeds cast in mischievous responses while Benjamin only respond and yes or no answers.
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:58.000 Kirby queries the two troopers on what they will do if attack they tell him they plan on throwing hand grenades down the rocky preposis
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.000 below their position and firing interlocking fires with their positions on their left and right.
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000 So that's Kirby Kirby's like okay what do you gonna do if we get hit they say we're in the third
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000 grenades over there and we got interlocking fendered fields of fire with these other position.
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000 Satisfied Kirby heads for the most forward position at the top of the eastern sector,
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000 man by Paul Harrison and Charles stucky both battle tested specialist Harrison and stucky of established
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000 interlocking fields of fire across the open end of the U.C. perimeter with Williams and Braim on the western side.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000 So he set the positions he went out inspect the positions make sure people understand their field of fire.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000 Squawed leaders actually doing his job.
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000 On the way back to his position Kirby Nides nods to Sergeant first class Edwin Shepherd sitting on the rim of the fox will not far apart from the morta pit
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000 Shepherd 38 is the only soldier there who's not in the morta platoon he stayed behind to catch a helicopter where he is a.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:03.000 To appear before a promotion board. Kirby sits on the edge of the fox will watch his sprains of talking on the radio with Captain Warren who's calling correction on where to place another
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000 Brown sprains of yells back correction to the gun crew and it then fires a few more rounds shortly after two p.m.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000 Warren radio sprains of that the helicopters are on the way and that word spreads from hold the whole.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000 What Warren does not know is that the helicopters are actually delayed and still sitting on the ground at L. Z.
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000 Savoie in the valley.
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000 Around 2.15 five minutes before the anticipated arrive at the helicopter.
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:37.000 Stucky spots three well camouflaged north Vietnamese army soldiers watching him from the elephant grass he opens fire with his M16 and Harrison joins in the three enemy drop either dead or wounded.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:46.000 So you're if you don't catch well camouflaged NVA if you're not paying attention these guys are paying attention.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:57.000 Then in the next instant. A massive volume of automatic fire and smaller fires on least from the high ground to the north and a ravine to the east shepherd sitting on the rim of the fox holds killed in the first valley.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:04.000 Vali within seconds the rocker propelled grenades more to rounds explode near each occupied position men bro deep inside their fox hold under the terrifying.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000 Shrapnel slicing through the air and bullets cracking overhead the platoon is surrounded outman and now gun.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:24.000 Kirby Elsa's friends are ready to warn and tell them they are under attack and need immediate immediate air and artillery support a stunned warn acknowledges immediately calls battalion for fire support and orders is company to turn around head back up the hill.
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000 So to your point earlier.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:37.000 Warren the reason he was able to turn around and head and go is because he didn't even want to leave in the first place.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:47.000 In the open stacking equipment taste falls to ground with two bullets to the throat buckly his shoulder covered and blood dashes across the open perimeter screaming get off the hill get off the hill and disappears in the elephant grass.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000 Harrison yells for stucky to go to the mortar pit while he stays behind a hold off the enemy.
01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:00.000 Stucky takes a few more shots at the enemy turns and zigzags for the mortar pit when an RPG round explodes in front of him throwing him to the ground after the sharp no and dirt stop falling.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000 He raises his head and looks to see where post of Benjamin had been trying to make an escape both or dead.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000 He sprints towards a large rock right just outside the perimeter as he turns the corner of it.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000 He encounters an enemy soldier about to throw a grenade into the LZ spotting stucky the NVA tosses the grenade directly at him at stand instead.
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000 The grenade sails over stucky's head hits the rock behind him and explodes wounding him.
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000 Managing to stay in his feet stucky fires three rounds in the NVA's chest killing him instantly.
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000 Stucky then moves around the rock face finds a narrow crevice and squeezes into it hidden from the enemy.
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:47.000 Paul Harrison slapping magazine after magazine to his rifle fires at every charging enemy soldier he can see when he runs out of ammunition he jumps up from his foxhole and charges the NVA using his M16 as a club.
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000 Cracking a few heads before the blood-covered rifle slips from his hands.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:01.000 He then wades into the enemy with his fist until he falls dead from dozens of bullets.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:11.000 As North Vietnamese burst through the elephant grass, Sprains opens up with his M16 on full automatic tearing three of them apart.
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:20.000 He manages to fire off a few more shots before RGB rounds, RBG rounds visible in their slow trajectory, plunged toward the mortar pit.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000 One round slams in front of Sprains' foxhole, shouring his back with strappin'l.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000 Another explodes to his left killing dock-crocker instantly.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000 The third round cent strappin'l into Kirby's arms head in chest.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000 The last round hits the rear lip of the mortar pit, tearing off drubbins right arm and mangling his left leg.
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000 He dies in a pool of blood.
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:48.000 Gains his killed with a bullet through his head.
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000 Johnson, the only gun crew member alive, takes shrapnel in the face, but continues firing on the advancing enemy.
01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:03.000 As attackers fall, others jump over them, running toward Johnson, who keeps firing until he is out of ammunition.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.000 He makes a running dive at the rocky embatement on heraford southern edge, and rolls down the slope,
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.000 carining off rocks and over tree roots until finally coming to a stop. He spots a V-shaped depression hidden in thick vegetation,
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000 with a stream running through it, pulls himself into the stream, and gathers brush and vines to hide his body grip with fear and exhaustion.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:31.000 On the western perimeter, Williams and Braim, frankly, fire their M-16s on full automatic at the waves of NVA, as do rotor and mack.
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:40.000 A few NVA fall dead, but most brave the wall of fire over running the position in killing Williams and Braim before turning toward rotor and mack.
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000 Mack pops up to get a better shot when he takes a bullet to the head, crumbling back into the foxhole dead.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:46:00.000 Rotor fires his M-79 until he is out of ammunition, then picks up M-16 and continues firing until it is empty. He throws two grenades at the charging enemy, forcing them to fall back, then jumps out of his fighting position at heads for Benton's foxhole.
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:13.000 When he tumbles in, he finds Benton dead. He crawls out, and with bullets trailing, is every step, races over to the foxhole of Brooks and Tamayo, but there dead as well.
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:21.000 The western defense is crumbled. Figuring everyone else's dead, Rotor does what he is trained to do, escape and evade.
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:32.000 He tears down the side of the hill into the elephant grass, followed by several enemy, with bullets zipping over his head, he runs deeper into the elephant grass as fast as he can, until he's overcome by exhaustion and drops to the ground.
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:43.000 When he is gasping, when his gasping for air subsides, he realized the enemy is no longer following him. He stays hidden, silently praying that he will be spared.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:50.000 Still in his whole, sprains a sees at figure running toward his position. He fires off a quick burst, somehow missing his target.
01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:01.000 Don't shoot for God's sake, it's me. Sam cast in screams as he drops into the foxhole. The reporter looks over at Kirby and yells, we need to get the hell out of here. Kirby shouts back where,
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000 we're surrounded.
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:14.000 Get six on the horn. Kirby tells Sprainsa. Tell him to hurry or we're dead. Sprainsa screams into the head set.
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000 Please hurry, we're being overrun.
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000 But Warren doesn't get the transmission as communication between hair for in the company no longer exists.
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:37.000 Sprainsa turns to the artillery frequency and repeats the message. The artillery artillery all passes the call to Warren, who now pushes his company even more ordering his men to double time up the hill, a murderous pace in the mud and tangled vines.
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:47.000 By this time, the battalion executive officer Major Cantrell is circling above hairford and his observation helicopter in Colonel Beard is watching the battle from his command and control Huey.
01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:00.000 The swarm of enemy they see below is so intermingled with the mortar position neither officer can distinguish who to. Rather than kill the defenders by mistake, Beard holds off on artillery requested by Kirby.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:10.000 Meanwhile, Kirby sees four enemy crawling towards his position less than 15 feet away and tosses three hand grenades as fast as he can stopping their advance. Kirby now realizes cast in his right.
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:24.000 They're only chance for survival is to get off the LZ. He cubs his hands to bark the order when the badly wounded taste suddenly drops into his foxhole. Kirby ties a dressing on tastes, bleeding throat and yells over the enemy fire.
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000 We got to make a break for it. Call, already on the hill.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:40.000 Sprains are reaches the artillery net shouting into the handset. We're getting out of here. The place is covered with enemy just about everybody is dead.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.000 He is told artillery is on hold.
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.000 With bullets kicking up dirt all around them Kirby entased low crawl over to Sprains and castin.
01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.000 We'll go over the rim in the direction the company will be coming in Holler's Kirby. Let's go. As Sprains are struggles with his radio while he climbs out of the foxhole Kirby screams forget the radio blow it.
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000 Sprains are pulls the pin of a hand grenade and throws it in the foxhole with the radio. The three soldiers and castin move is quickly away from the blast and a few steps later come across a wounded.
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:26.000 Wounded AV spikes clutching his M79. Kirby and Sprains have their M16s but very little ammunition. Castin who is also wounded has a 357 Magnum that Kirby gave him. Taste is unarmed.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:42.000 The five wounded men now move toward the slope, descending into a deep ravine to the east. Kirby tastes spikes and castin run crawl and roll into the elephant grass while Sprains act as a rear guard before rolling down the hill to join them.
01:49:42.000 --> 01:50:02.000 As they reach a small ravine they hear the enemy coming down from the LZ and Hopper suit they lie down figuring the Americans are hiding. The NVA began beating the grass. The first North Vietnamese to spot the Americans is shot in the face by Sprainsa. Kirby kills another standing nearby Spikes fires his M79 near the group killing five the other two crawl away wounded.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:13.000 Seconds later another group of North Vietnamese spray the ground around the American Sprainsa takes three bullets in his right leg one smashing into his kneecap severing the tendon. Another bullet rips through his left leg.
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000 I'm hit Sprainsa screams as he falls into a heap on the jungle floor. Kirby sprays the advancing enemy with the last of his ammunition causing them to retreat.
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:44.000 When he bends down to check on Sprainsa bullet smashes into his right arm he's now losing blood from many wounds. Kirby eyes and NVA peeking over the grass and pulls out a rusty French flare gun. He'd found on an old battlefield and fires hitting him between the eyes. The soldier falls backward screaming in agony as his flesh burns away.
01:50:44.000 --> 01:51:09.000 In the meantime taste silently boot bleeds to death from his throat wounds. Hearing something behind him, Sprainsa spins around just as a bullet enters the back of his skull, travels through his jaw and excess out of his nose tearing away the cartilage teeth tissue and skin. Eyes filled with blood, Sprainsa goes down badly wounded but somehow still alive.
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:27.000 Possibly to regroup the enemy stops firing. Kirby tells everyone to head farther down the ravine quietly the four-group survivors crawl then walk down the slope with help from Kirby and Spike Sprainsa manages to keep up.
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:37.000 Feeling somewhat safe with an NVA about a hundred yards behind they move a little faster, suddenly spotting a small group of enemy coming up a trail to their flank. Sprainsa signals to get down.
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:49.000 Sprainsa's chest is not seen as sprainsa's warning and keeps going running straight into a group of North Vietnamese coming from another direction. One of the NVA shoots casting the head killing him.
01:51:49.000 --> 01:52:00.000 The enemy now opens fire into the grass from two sides. Spike takes several bullets in his chest. Kirby checks his pulse but cannot find one.
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:13.000 He gets to meet troops slowly wade through the grass toward Kirby and Sprainsa. Kirby's out of ammo. Sprainsa's rifle is jammed but he has two grenades left and he gives them to Kirby who tosses them into the advancing enemy.
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:22.000 Just then, friendly artillery rounds begin pounding LZ-Hairford. The deafening explodes and stop the enemy's advance.
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:35.000 Kirby and Sprainsa take advantage of the situation and begin to move slowly back up the hill but it's too much for Sprainsa. Go without me he gas. I can't move any further. I'm dying. I'm not leaving you alone. Says Kirby.
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:46.000 Go now. Sprainsa yell save yourself. I've made peace with my Lord. Just go.
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:55.000 Kirby, believing Sprainsa will die for sure reluctantly, exceeds to the RTO's demand and crawls away back towards Hairford.
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:07.000 Sprainsa, although growing weaker from loss of blood, finds the will to take off a scabbard knife, strapped to his leg by a leather thong. He places the knife around on the ground.
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:18.000 Next to him uses the raw hide as a turn to get to stop the bleeding in his right leg. He then somehow manages to open his first aid kit, find a gauze bandage and begins wrapping around his head and eye.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.000 Before he can finish however, he hears rustling of men coming toward him through the grass. He takes his knife and do his hand and rolls over face down in the dirt.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:36.000 Playing dead, Sprainsa doesn't move a muscle as three or four NVA slowly approach. He smells their bodies and stale breath as they search him for anything of value.
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:46.000 One man turns him over and roughly strips off his signature ring. Another's take his wallet, cigarettes and dog tags, unable to stay motionless another second.
01:53:46.000 --> 01:54:00.000 He's about to jump up with his knife when he hears a helicopter rapidly descending. It sprays the ground with bullets, some so close they spatter dirt in his face, screaming frantically, the NVA run for cover.
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:13.000 Still afraid to move, Sprainsa continues to play dead and seconds later he hears someone carefully moving toward him. He grips his knife a little tighter and when he feels a hand grab his shoulder he musters all the strength he has left and tries stabbing the man.
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:27.000 But the large shadowy figure bat-lick by the sun drifting through the trees quickly grabs Sprainsa's knife in hand, screaming, hey it's me Carlos Carlos Cruz.
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000 Charlie Company had made it back up the hill.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:42.000 The last of his energy drained, Sprainsa lays down his head and slips into unconsciousness. Kirby is halfway up the slope when friendly artillery cease is falling, uncertain what it means.
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:53.000 He keeps crawling, his many wounds are taking their toll but he keeps going until he reaches the top of the hill where he sees Charlie Company troops everywhere.
01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:02.000 Unable to control his wounded body and freight emotions, he slides to the ground, a medic gives him a shot of morphine and stops his bleeding.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000 When the wounded stucky comes crawling into the LZ and other medic rushes over, lays him down and treats his wounds.
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:18.000 Sprainsa is carried up the hill and a stretcher made from ponchos and shortly he, Kirby and Stucky are placed in a meta-vac helicopter and flown out.
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:26.000 Passing the meta-vac flying out, helicopters begin delivering reinforcements who pile out onto her referred.
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:36.000 A look of horror passes over their faces at the sight of so much death and destruction, one soldier throws up.
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:46.000 Hearing the helicopters coming and going, Johnson, who got off the hill and evaded the enemy slowly approaches the LZ, only to face the muzzle of an M16 held by PFC Morgan.
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:53.000 He drops to the ground out of relief when he is recognized by Morgan.
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000 The last mortar pulled to and survivor to get back to the LZ as a dazed rotor.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:08.000 Company pulled to and leader asked Rogan to identify the bodies, all of which had been stripped of personal effects and shot in the head.
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:17.000 He is able to name a few before the weight of the massacre takes its toll.
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000 He cannot look at another dead friend.
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:31.000 As he sits down, the afternoon monsoon rains begin pouring down out of the dark sky.
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:40.000 Rotor shivers as the rain pelts his sobbing body.
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000 So much death in such a small place.
01:56:45.000 --> 01:57:00.000 So there's another view of this battle and clearly,
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:08.000 the difference is immense the leadership issues.
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000 There's a whole discussion to have about that.
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000 What point when you're being told to do something that doesn't make sense?
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000 What point do you say, or not doing that?
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000 And this is leadership strategy and tactics.
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000 The whole assessment of that.
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000 And it's not like I'm not saying leadership strategy and tactics tells you the answer.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000 But it gives you the options.
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000 And it's heavy options to weigh.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000 And you could look at Warren and say, well, if it wasn't safe, I wouldn't do it.
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000 Okay, well, then he fires you on the spot.
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000 He puts the young lieutenant in charge of the bulltune.
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000 Now, you can also say, hey, Roger that.
01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000 By the way, give me a fire team over here, give me a machine gunner.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000 This is what we're doing.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000 Once the boss leaves, you can do that.
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000 That's good option.
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000 I like that option.
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000 You can, and you don't know what kind of relationship we have.
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000 Because there's also, I mean, I guess we could say the peers that you relationship is great.
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000 I guess we do know that much.
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:27.000 But sometimes, if somebody is very convicted in the way that they're offering advice, it can be convincing.
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000 And this is something that I have to be careful of.
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000 Because I know I can be convincing.
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000 I know I can't be.
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000 And I have to be careful.
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000 In fact, that's one of the probably original reasons for me being such a listener.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000 As I know that, if I say, I think we should do this.
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000 A lot of people just get a Roger that.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000 Like, if that's what you think, we're on board.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000 I mean, that's kind of something I had to watch out for.
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:58.000 And it'd turn me into more of a listener because I didn't want to subdue people's thoughts.
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000 I didn't want to tamper with their ideas.
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:07.000 And I didn't want to override how they thought something should go.
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:14.000 So we have to be careful of that as a leader to make sure that we aren't just being so overbearing that people don't.
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000 That people don't push back against us.
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.000 The three different versions, I do if you want to call them versions, just a three different perspectives of that.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000 You know, paint each one paints such a unique picture.
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000 And, you know, I wrote down on my notes again, everything that I write down,
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000 and just the things that I'm thinking in real time.
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000 And it's really frustrating to sit here and listen to this,
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:49.000 knowing the outcome and seeing all these pieces play out, knowing that this was a totally,
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000 this was a preventable, this is a leadership failure.
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000 It is a leadership failure at a lot of different levels.
01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000 And this last one really paints a more clear picture of how this predicament happened.
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000 But knowing that this is not an unsolvable problem that they were just,
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000 you know, way could this have been prevented, this is just simply not true.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000 And the frustration of that. And when I picture just the conversation of the,
02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000 of the person in charge telling a subordinate do it or else,
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000 just the philosophy that I lead through my authority.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000 And the catastrophic events that happened that has, in this case,
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000 we're talking human life, I mean, this is a, a catastrophic thing,
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000 but those same, that same approach and how often leaders are in fact,
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:48.000 and what they want, not recognizing just how destructive that is to them as a leader.
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000 And then I'm sitting and trying to picture these guys up,
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000 and I have a couple of looking down, and the seconding feeling they must have had,
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000 this is what, what did I create, how did I, how did this happen?
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000 Well, it happened because of you because you as a leader demanded
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000 things happen the way that you want, and I'm picturing,
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000 I mean, and I was struggling early with this guy with, with the company commander,
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000 not being able to reconcile, and that's just me piecing things together.
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000 And, and I imagine this feeling of the entire time walking down the hill,
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.000 knowing, knowing he didn't want to do that.
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000 The, pat, you quote, front line, the front line, the leader in the field,
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000 is always right, right? So you're coming from your,
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000 how will it come through? You're getting off and you're telling me what to do.
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000 That just sits so foul for me.
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000 And the other thing that's interesting about this is,
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000 you would think that we could be sitting here saying,
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000 as to, you know, military leaders that you and I were,
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.000 it's very easy to say, we could, you and I could be sitting here having a conversation
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000 where look, discipline is paramount.
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000 Obviously, we could sit here and say,
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000 jocco, jocco is saying discipline is paramount.
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000 No one would question that for one millisecond.
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000 Discipline is paramount.
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000 You have to, you have to get people into a point where they will obey what you say,
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000 and you, they need to do it.
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.000 That's what military training is.
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000 That's what you learn in boot camp.
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000 That's what you learn in officer candidate school to,
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000 to instant obey orders.
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000 Like, that's what we want.
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000 And that's just just so wrong.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000 It's so wrong to think that it's so wrong to feel that way.
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000 And you know what?
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.000 Like, I'm so thankful that I had the luxury of being in the military
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000 and being able to experience this.
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000 And then on top of that, getting to see it while I was training people.
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000 And then on top of it, getting to see it with all these companies that we work with.
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000 Because occasionally, to this day,
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000 someone will say to me, somebody at some company will say,
02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000 yeah, but sometimes don't they just need just showing up and do what they're told to do.
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000 I get that.
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000 I get that.
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000 I still get that.
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000 And what they think I'm going to say is, whoa, you hell, yeah.
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000 That's what everybody thinks I'm going to say.
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000 And it's like, actually, no, you don't want that.
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000 And I actually, I actually had a good situation like this.
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000 I was working with a client.
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000 And I had two people on the call. There's more than two people, but there's two people that kind of rose to the conversation.
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000 One of them was, you know, but they just need to do it.
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000 And I rebutted that guy and said, well, if what you're going to do is just, you know,
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000 bark to them, shut up and do it, whether you believe it or not,
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000 that's not going to have a good outcome and here's why I went through the whole thing.
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.000 And when I got done with that, the other guy said, that's what we need to do.
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000 We need to actually listen what they have to say.
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000 We have to take their input and all those things.
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000 We need to make their plan, all those things that we talk about all the time,
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:59.000 which is it's just shocking that people still, you know what?
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000 They think tactically because tactically, if I say Dave shut up and do what I told you to do,
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000 you're going to do it.
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000 You're just like, this guy did.
02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:13.000 It's a tactical in, hey, the Italian commander says, hey, you shut up and do what I told you to do.
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000 Yeah, Roger that.
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000 Okay, you just won the tactical battle, but what, what happens?
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000 Look what happens.
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000 You won that little tactical battle and you lose these other people and look,
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000 could there have been no one waiting on that, I'll see you absolutely.
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000 There could have been no one waiting, there could have been no one waiting.
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000 There could have been no one waiting on that, I'll see you and everything would have gone fine.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000 And that guy's tyrannical behavior would have been reinforced as the right way to lead.
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000 And in an eight the right way to lead is not the right way to lead.
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:48.000 This guy's a battalion commander, he's probably been leading like that through his whole career with with with with no consequence.
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000 Certainly no nothing like this to this degree, this story.
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000 And you know what makes that happen and I brought this up with a client the other day.
02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:06.000 In the military, because I say, look, you can be effective with that kind of brow beating tyrannical leadership for, for whatever,
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000 for an hour, for a week, right?
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000 I can just y'all Dave shut up and do what I told you to do.
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000 And actually in the military, I can get away with it from my whole career.
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000 Why is that?
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:21.000 Because you Dave, you're working for me, you know, you only have to work for me for 18 months.
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000 You know, it's going to take me a couple months to figure myself out.
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000 By the time my tour is starting to look coming to an end, you're not even going to give me resistance anymore.
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000 You're like cool, he's gone and whatever.
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000 So these guys can bounce from job to job to job being in charge of this group.
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000 By the time he leaves, they hit, he's hated.
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000 But he's accomplished, he's quote accomplished the mission, right?
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000 He's got his good fit rep. He's done his job. He's accomplished the mission.
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000 He's hated. They don't want to do it. They're sabotaged.
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000 And they're, they're, they're sloughing him off. They're doing all those things.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000 But no one knows it.
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000 His, his chain of command above him thinks, oh, yeah, well, did a good job.
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000 He got the mission accomplished.
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000 First of all, they never got tested.
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000 Second of all, it doesn't know the moral of the troops because that guy's able to hide it.
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000 So that's how these military leaders sometimes they get through their whole career.
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000 Yeah, and I mean, whole career. I'm talking 34 year careers where they never actually led anybody.
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000 All they did was bar quarters and they retire as an admiral. They retire as a general and they don't know how to lead.
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000 They don't know how to lead. Obviously, there's some incredible generals and animals.
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000 Obviously, and captains and kernels. Obviously.
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:31.000 But just because you became an admiral or you became a kernel or you became a captain or you became a general.
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:37.000 That doesn't mean you know how to lead. And you know what? You if you were a tyrannical leader.
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000 You, you can get away with that in the military. You can get away with it because only a two year command.
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000 No one wants to, they, well, I guess what? Everyone below you actually also wants a good fit wrap.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000 So you want a good fit wrap. So you're going to bark in everyone and everyone below you just wants a good evaluation.
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000 So they're just going to kind of follow your lead and put up with it.
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000 That, I mean, that's that self preservation. I saw that in my career all the time too.
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000 And we had a term for it. We called it a run out the clocks scenario.
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000 And we'd sit, you know, and we'd have, you know, young captains.
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000 The junior guys would sit around and it was just us and we'd vent and we'd get frustrated.
02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000 And I'd see people complain and I'd see my peers getting this off their chest and and when you do the calculation,
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000 Hey, what are we going to do about it? Are we going to push back or we're going to, you know,
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000 Are we going to fight back up the chain of the end? The conclusion is always
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000 just run out the clock man. This guy's gone in seven months or whatever or just,
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000 Yeah, this guy's gone in seven months and by the way, we have a, we got a two month trip here.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:42.000 He's not coming with us. We got this. We got that. He's going to this thing and it's really what is it going to be face to face
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000 and him for another month. Don't worry about it.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000 And I don't know me to paint some picture that we just sort of resigned yourself.
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000 Really what it was was, you know, I'm going to focus my energy. Oh, my guys.
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000 Yeah. I'm going to, I'm not going to waste my time with this guy.
02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:00.000 But, but it does create that that it helps perpetuate this scenario, just describe and, you know,
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000 to whatever small percentage there are leaders in the military, just like every other organization
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000 that got their way, they, they, they got their way through and it, and they're not good leaders
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:18.000 because they do exactly this and, and I'm, I'm thinking too of of not just a scenario where
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000 you're my subordinate leader and I go, hey, I want to done this way, Jaco.
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.000 And you're not like, well, me, you know, I was kind of thinking maybe plan B is better than plan A.
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:34.000 You're saying, Dave, no way, man. What better position for me is a leader to have a guy who, who,
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000 the more infatric you are about what you're doing more likely, it's likely that the more loyal you are
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000 and the more you want the outcome to be good. That's why you're pushing back.
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.000 And if you're in a leadership position and your people are pushing back aggressively,
02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:55.000 that's even more of a reason to listen to them because this clearly is something.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000 And what always happens is we meet, we see people meet resistance with resistance.
02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000 The more resistance I get, the more I should stop resisting them.
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000 Or I want to listen. Now, if you go,
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.000 well, yeah, I mean, I guess so, okay, according to Stu Mayway, and that's kind of the end of the story.
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000 But if you, if you go to the mat with me, no, this is a bad idea.
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000 And I'm not going to listen to that as a leader. Why is this person pushing back?
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000 Because they, because they don't care about the mission.
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000 They don't care about the people. They don't care about the outcome.
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.000 And it's, yeah, it's, it's Jockel pushing back because he doesn't,
02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000 because he doesn't care about his people because he doesn't want to be successful.
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000 Why, why would Jockel possibly be drawing a line in the sand right now, right?
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000 Yeah, there's a read, you want to know what the reason is.
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000 There's a reason. There's a reason. There's a damn reason.
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.000 And you need to figure it out. And also, in this thing, this scenario we're painting where you're my subordinate leader.
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.000 I also have to give you a little bit of credit that you recognize, you are putting your career at risk.
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000 What, you're going to bow up to me, Junior subordinate.
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000 I have to recognize that you even realize that this is a sketchy move you're making right now.
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000 You're going to the boss and tell him, no.
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000 You don't think the subordinate leader recognizes the risk that he's taking by digging in.
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000 In a little bit, and going boss, this is a bad idea.
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.000 I mean, of course, I'm sitting here with the luxury of having benefited from all the things that
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000 Eschlan front has done and all the things you've written about and all the podcasts I've listened to.
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000 It doesn't make it any less easy to hear the story and picture that conversation.
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000 And know that that tyrannical leadership is widespread in its all over the place.
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000 And it doesn't work.
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000 It's frustrating to listen to that story and you think about the catastrophic outcome.
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000 But even the subtleties of people leading through, hey, at the end, we can go back and forth.
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000 But in the end, you're going to do it my way.
02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.000 What a devastating approach that is to leading the people around you.
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000 Horrible in every possible way.
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000 So digging a little bit deeper on this.
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:21.000 There was some, there was some people that wrote in to historynet.com and asked Michael Christie for some more amplifying information.
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000 Here's one of the letters that got written in.
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:29.000 The article last handed LZ Harraford by Michael Christie had me living the experiences as if I were there.
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:37.000 I served in Vietnam with the Marines, including 40 days under siege at Caun Pin in 1967.
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000 We always feared a human wave attack like experienced by the soldiers in Harraford.
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:55.000 I would like to know if Lieutenant Colonel Rutland Beard was ever charged with negligence for ordering Charlie Company commander Captain Don Warren to leave his mortar platoon behind in a vulnerable position with no infantry support while the rest of Charlie moved out.
02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:07.000 Also, I was curious to know if Staff Sergeant Robert Kirby was recognized for his harrowing attempt to lead a small group of soldiers and journalists Sam Cast and to safety.
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:16.000 I have to wonder how John Sprainsa who was badly wounded and played dead before his rescue and the other survivors are doing today after their dreadful experience.
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:24.000 Well, for one thing, we know that Staff Sergeant John Kirby, though not named, was written about in a very negative way in this other manual.
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000 But guess what, Michael Christie respond?
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000 And here's where here's his response.
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:40.000 As one would expect, the horrors of the massacre at LZ Harraford had a tremendous impact on the lives of those of all those involved.
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:49.000 Captain Don Warren became an alcoholic and eventually committed suicide.
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:57.000 So the decision that we're sitting here toiling over.
02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000 He toiled over it too.
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:09.000 Sergeant Robert Kirby retired from the army and refuses to talk about LZ Harraford claiming he remembers almost nothing about it.
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000 Although he did receive a silver star for his part in the battle.
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000 God bless him.
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000 Bob Roter has a severe case of PTSD.
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000 But still managed to succeed.
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000 He married his high school sweetheart raised a family and operated in multi-million dollar medical supply business.
02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000 John Sprainsa overcame his physical injuries.
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000 So Bob Roter was the last guy to be recovered.
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000 He got broke down trying to identify his friends.
02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000 John Sprainsa got shot in the ear.
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000 Exit wound in the nose.
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000 John Sprainsa overcame his physical injuries but suffered from emotional damage.
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.000 His drinking lead to three divorces yet the same determination that saved his life.
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000 46 years ago, allowed him to work successfully in two long careers.
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.000 First in the printing industry and then as a rural postman for 20 years.
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000 He and his wife for 26 years are retired in the vignore than Georgia.
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:08.000 Charles Stucky died of cancer six years ago.
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000 No one has heard from Isaac Johnson since El Zihar referred who's overrun.
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000 No official record exists on Rutland Beard receiving any reprimand.
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000 He retired from the army as a colonel.
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000 As for the company members who rushed to the rescue,
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000 all are still horrified by the carnage they witnessed once they reached El Zihar referred.
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:40.000 There's another letter.
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000 The story of Carnage on El Zihar referred as a riveting piece of work but as noted it very
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000 clearly in spots from the SLA martial narrative published 46 years ago.
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000 Nonetheless both authors accurately capture the overall horror of the event.
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000 About a week before the attack described by Christy on a company from another battalion had been
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000 overrun at Herford.
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000 And my company from the one five-cap first-cav division was airlifted onto the El Zihar
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000 the following morning to assist.
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:17.000 In his book Battles in the Montsoon Marshall claimed that all that the KIAs had been evacuated
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:25.000 the previous evening but I distinctly recall seeing the poncho covered bodies of the US soldiers still ringing.
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.000 And there's one more little, maybe not so little.
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.000 There's one more detail that I want to go into.
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000 So Sam Casten.
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:53.000 The journalist.
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000 He was married when he was in Vietnam.
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:07.000 And his wife, a woman named Fran Casten, had moved to Hong Kong while he was working in Vietnam.
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.000 So they were close flight.
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000 He figured, well I still want to see you.
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000 So we'll move to Hong Kong and then we're going to go working Vietnam and then we're not working
02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000 on coming back. And they've been there for about a month before he was killed.
02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000 And they had a 13-month-old toddler at the time.
02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:43.000 They were in Hong Kong and after he was killed, she packed up, she went back to the states.
02:16:43.000 --> 02:17:01.000 I mean, devastated obviously and not only devastated but now what?
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:13.000 Whatever plans she had are now obviously gone.
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000 So she had to put her life together as best she could.
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:23.000 She had been a school. She'd studied English, I believe.
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:29.000 And she went and started knocking on doors and eventually got a job at the New Yorker magazine.
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:37.000 And then she moved over to the Scholastic magazine.
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:45.000 And eventually became a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:57.000 Teaching right again. And that is when at age 40 she started the right poetry.
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:08.36 And she wrote a poem about her husband, Sam Castan, the brave journalist who was killed on that
02:18:08.36 --> 02:18:15.000 awful day. And the poem is called Operation Crazy Horse.
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:25.000 And here it is, a grand Calloun Hotel, a hedge of red
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000 Habiscus, a tiled pool.
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:39.000 A masseuse who pressed fragrant oil of almond into my body in the full heat of the sun.
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:55.000 Elsewhere, northeast of Saigon, a man beheld you and fired.
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000 At the undertakers, you were all made up.
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:11.000 And your hair was parted wrong, so I smoothed it the way you would have liked.
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000 Someone shouted, stop.
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:23.000 As if we were caught making love on the couch and my father's house.
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000 God knows what they feared.
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:35.000 Unfamiliar streaks in your hair must have pailed at the moment of terror.
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000 And grown longer in the time since.
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:49.000 Eerie as strands of ticker tape still printing.
02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:55.000 Such dark hair shocked white.
02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:03.000 How afraid you were.
02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:25.000 All I could do was hold you.
02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.000 And there you go.
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:37.000 There is more to every story.
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:47.000 And more for us to learn.
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000 And what we need to learn here.
02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:03.000 And what we need to learn here is to learn from our opinions from all of this.
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000 Is that your decision and your actions make a difference and have an impact on the world.
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000 Again, like this is an incredible manual.
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:21.000 The squad leader makes a difference.
02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:27.000 It doesn't just apply to squad leaders and applies to all of us.
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000 Your actions make a difference and have an impact on the world.
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:37.000 You're going to leave a mark.
02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:49.000 You leave an imprint on the world and you leave an imprint on the people around you.
02:21:49.000 --> 02:22:03.000 So make it a good one.
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000 Well echo Charles.
02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000 Yes sir.
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000 Go ahead man.
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.000 Well it's true.
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000 We do leave an impact on the people around us.
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000 And we do make a difference.
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000 And to make a difference, we need to be capable.
02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000 We do the right things for ourselves.
02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000 So people around us.
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000 We start with our physical health.
02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000 In my opinion as I always say.
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000 So on our journey through the improvement and maintaining physical health.
02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000 You know.
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000 We need supplement.
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000 I give you hard time about just being able to press record.
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000 It's like a very hard job.
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000 But what I just did to you is kind of a shitty thing to do isn't it?
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000 Well you're throwing that challenge and I understand.
02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000 You don't have to come to understand these things.
02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000 Which is okay.
02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000 For those of you that might be joining us for the first time.
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000 Sometimes the podcast can be a little much.
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000 We'll have you.
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000 And so early on we realize that maybe a little decompression would be good.
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000 I know I needed.
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000 Yeah.
02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000 I know I needed sometimes.
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:30.000 So so I'm sorry for setting you up with the freaking horrible job of going from that conversation that we just had.
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000 Into whatever it is you're talking about.
02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000 I'm sorry bro.
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000 It's okay and you know what in the spirit of understanding and how should I say.
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000 Doing my part.
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:51.000 I should have took what you said and really gave my thoughts on it because my thoughts can be a little bit lighter than your general.
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000 So it would be a little bit of a trans a little smoother transition.
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000 Because you just went straight into talking about you know.
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000 Yeah.
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000 Yeah.
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000 Still true.
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000 What would your thoughts have been?
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.000 Oh man that's like that's why I didn't go into it because it was like dang.
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000 I should just be quiet just for a little bit.
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000 Yeah.
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000 Maybe.
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000 Yeah.
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000 That's part of the thing.
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000 That's part of the deal is.
02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000 That could just be the end of the podcast.
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000 I get it.
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000 Right.
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.000 But I actually don't want to leave anyone.
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000 That way to be honest with you.
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000 I don't want to leave.
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000 Look.
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000 The point has been made.
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000 We get it.
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000 Right.
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000 It's true.
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:38.000 Yeah.
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000 I don't want to leave.
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000 So I don't want someone to press stop walk out and like that's what's going through their head.
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000 Yeah.
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000 They walk through the work also.
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.000 Right.
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000 We need to little.
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000 We need to bring it back around.
02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000 Right.
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000 The world has darkness in it.
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000 Right.
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000 We just saw that.
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000 We just saw that.
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000 Yeah.
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000 By the way, the author.
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000 The his wife, Fran Castan.
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.000 She's alive.
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000 She's in like East Hampton or something.
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000 She's out there.
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000 Right in poems.
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000 Yeah.
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000 Maybe we're here from her.
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.000 You know.
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000 Yeah.
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000 I mean, given the circumstances, it's like, okay.
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000 It's what he call like good to meet you.
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000 But not under these circumstances.
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000 Yeah.
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000 That's what he'll do.
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000 The common.
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000 Anyway.
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.000 All right.
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.000 Well.
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000 How can we make a difference if we're not capable?
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000 Right.
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000 True.
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000 We'll just say it's hard.
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000 I would say where we want to make a good mark on the world.
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000 Yeah.
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000 How do we do that?
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000 What?
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.000 How do you suggest us doing a better job of leaving a positive impression on people and on the world?
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000 I say, keep your stuff together.
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000 Cool.
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000 Got it.
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000 Keep it together.
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000 Clean.
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000 Yeah.
02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000 You know, get it together.
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000 Did you get a break of your support?
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000 He's reading freaking cans.
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000 He's reading me greedy.
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000 I'm not saying you're wrong.
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000 He's looking at that.
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000 That's like a what he call like a vanity.
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000 But he's looking at his own can.
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000 He's like, oh, my can.
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000 He's a notice.
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000 I've to forever.
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000 If why I do, I've just happened to notice that these are two different cans.
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000 So it caught my attention.
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000 Oh, really?
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000 Oh, I see that too now.
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000 See?
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000 So.
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000 I guess I could be more vain than I am.
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000 Honestly, I'm just.
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000 No, just now barely noticing.
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000 These are different cans.
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000 The same drink.
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:29.000 Yeah.
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000 Because right before that, you're looking at your fingernails and like you're, you know,
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000 I don't know if you worked out today, whatever you're looking at.
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000 You're physique.
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000 I saw the whole deal.
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000 I saw the whole deal.
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000 So all good and all or or he could be bored whichever.
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.000 Well, I think you've successfully lightened the mood.
02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000 All right.
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000 Well, I'm done.
02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000 You know, a press record.
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:51.000 I do things from time to time nonetheless.
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000 When we're working out, we need supplements.
02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000 So, you know, it's joints get.
02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000 Take a beating.
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000 Sometimes we've got supplements for you joints.
02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000 You need protein.
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000 Okay.
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000 So if you're working out hard and hard, isn't, you know, depends on who you are, whatever.
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000 You need a certain amount of protein to facilitate the gains.
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000 Or should I say the results?
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000 Okay.
02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000 Ah, you said games.
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000 I haven't.
02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000 You said games.
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000 I'm a little bit with the.
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000 I saw it.
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000 The point is you need a certain amount of protein.
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000 Otherwise, we'd buy now going to recover.
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000 We recover correctly.
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000 Do you know the protein range?
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000 Yeah.
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000 I see that.
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000 Yes.
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000 One gram.
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000 What?
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000 Go ahead.
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000 You're like shaking your head.
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000 I'm sorry.
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000 I'm sorry.
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000 Interested.
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000 You're going to.
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:37.000 What?
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000 One gram.
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000 One gram per pound of lean body mass.
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000 Yeah.
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000 I think that's.
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000 Do I know correctly?
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000 I think that's the old school.
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000 It's actually less than the new school.
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000 Okay.
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000 I'm going to arrange from point six.
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000 Okay.
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000 I mean, one that's high.
02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000 One gram per, you know,
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000 fainter.
02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000 Stuff.
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000 It might.
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000 It starts to level out.
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000 I think it like point eight or something like.
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000 Okay.
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000 Nonetheless, not everyone knows that is what I'm trying to say.
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:10.000 So, and furthermore, not only do not do not a lot of people know that,
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000 it's hard to do that.
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000 Unless you're like just that's your jam.
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000 You know, you're planning the week and all that.
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000 You know, I didn't realize that.
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000 So, look, let's say you have 180 five pounds of lean body mass in.
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000 And you're trying to get the point seven.
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000 We'll say, it's a lot of protein.
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000 Not for you.
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000 I know.
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000 But I'm just saying for the rest of, you know, like,
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000 I don't think about it.
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000 But I'm everything up that echo is trying to say,
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000 you need more.
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000 Okay.
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000 See, see, right, you're not like, you know,
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000 really understanding, like,
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000 okay,
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000 seven, one range.
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000 That's what you're talking about.
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000 Mulk is needed.
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000 Let's say I didn't say any of that.
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000 Okay.
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000 What if I just said, hey, you need more people going to be like,
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000 all right.
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000 You have failed.
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000 Point to describe why you need more.
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000 I'll stand down.
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000 But can you hurry a little bit?
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000 I'm standing down, but can you just, like,
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000 we get the mass.
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000 Do you want to?
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000 Do you though?
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000 Do you get the mass?
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000 I think we get the mass in the ground.
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000 I obviously don't think you do, and that's why I'm here.
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000 See, if you do it.
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000 Yeah, between, you and Dave, you are too awkward.
02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000 I think I Bet, you know, I think I'll ask,
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000 take good.
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000 Anyway, take them all.
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000 Yeah, this is too bad.
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000 Can I ever see a more brilliant, like this?
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000 I like it anyway.
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000 Speaking of discipline, go.
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000 Okay, and bear with me here, bear with me.
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000 So discipline, go, it's a thing.
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000 It tastes good, it's a little drink.
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000 Kind of like a soda.
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000 Mmm-hmm.
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000 I mean, okay, it's not like a soda
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000 but it's like a soda.
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.08 So, and I'm gonna tell a little story short.
02:29:46.08 --> 02:29:48.20 So, you know how like when you go to the movies, right?
02:29:48.20 --> 02:29:49.20 You go to the movies.
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:50.20 Yep, do you get no?
02:29:50.20 --> 02:29:51.60 So, the in popcorn at the movies.
02:29:51.60 --> 02:29:52.60 Sure.
02:29:52.60 --> 02:29:53.60 They've broke.
02:29:53.60 --> 02:29:54.60 So, the popcorn?
02:29:54.60 --> 02:29:55.60 Sometimes, right?
02:29:55.60 --> 02:29:56.60 Yeah, that's the thing.
02:29:56.60 --> 02:29:59.54 So, you go to the movies, you get your soda, you get your popcorn, you have the
02:29:59.54 --> 02:30:02.16 wash the movie, but your kids, it's awesome, right?
02:30:02.16 --> 02:30:06.44 You come home and you kind of remember whether it be later that night or the next day,
02:30:06.44 --> 02:30:07.84 you're like, oh yeah, that's a cool movie.
02:30:07.84 --> 02:30:09.76 I mean, man, but I ate that whole thing of popcorn.
02:30:09.76 --> 02:30:12.96 You know, many calories are in popcorn and junk calories, too, by the way.
02:30:12.96 --> 02:30:13.96 There's a difference.
02:30:13.96 --> 02:30:14.96 I have no idea.
02:30:14.96 --> 02:30:17.92 It's like 2000, it depends on how big the popcorn is.
02:30:17.92 --> 02:30:18.92 And then you got the soda, right?
02:30:18.92 --> 02:30:23.52 And there's a small tinge of guilt that comes with you.
02:30:23.52 --> 02:30:27.24 Same thing with the brownies, same thing with the other stuff that you eat, don't
02:30:27.24 --> 02:30:28.24 actually eat.
02:30:28.24 --> 02:30:31.76 Oh, the pretzel wrap, pretzel wrapped hot dogs at my wife made for me on Superb
02:30:31.76 --> 02:30:32.76 Balls Sunday.
02:30:32.76 --> 02:30:37.04 I somehow, I forget where everyone was, but like, they came out of the oven.
02:30:37.04 --> 02:30:38.84 And my fam wasn't around.
02:30:38.84 --> 02:30:41.84 And I was like, oh, I just have one or two while my family's not around.
02:30:41.84 --> 02:30:44.68 I racked it half a track, half a tray.
02:30:44.68 --> 02:30:45.68 I crushed them.
02:30:45.68 --> 02:30:47.92 How big was the tray?
02:30:47.92 --> 02:30:50.04 I don't know this, but it's like a cookie type.
02:30:50.04 --> 02:30:51.84 Oh, like a sheet like a regular standard.
02:30:51.84 --> 02:30:52.84 Yeah, the standard.
02:30:52.84 --> 02:30:53.84 It's a lot.
02:30:53.84 --> 02:30:56.08 It must have been a nice good.
02:30:56.08 --> 02:31:00.28 I'm going to go and say 20, 20 of those things.
02:31:00.28 --> 02:31:02.36 You figure like no, like no factor.
02:31:02.36 --> 02:31:04.88 That's probably like 300 calories per probably.
02:31:04.88 --> 02:31:05.88 I have to.
02:31:05.88 --> 02:31:07.60 They're real small.
02:31:07.60 --> 02:31:13.16 But those are like sausages with freaking straight up biscuits.
02:31:13.16 --> 02:31:15.44 Yeah, like, oh, that's who knows.
02:31:15.44 --> 02:31:16.64 But I bought it there.
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:17.64 Oh, yeah.
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:18.64 It sounded nice.
02:31:18.64 --> 02:31:19.48 And you, I get it.
02:31:19.48 --> 02:31:21.96 Like you'll just go punish, you know, you'll pay the price in X-in.
02:31:21.96 --> 02:31:28.12 They're just a little bit more like gal to, like, man, I just, I kind of just shouldn't
02:31:28.12 --> 02:31:29.12 have done that.
02:31:29.12 --> 02:31:33.08 You know, anyway, the point is when you drink the discipline, go and the milk, too, by
02:31:33.08 --> 02:31:37.56 the way, you get that same sort of satisfaction that you would have had with the soda
02:31:37.56 --> 02:31:43.16 or the freaking Oreo cookie shake from the drive through or wherever.
02:31:43.16 --> 02:31:46.40 You get that same front end, but you get a way better back end.
02:31:46.40 --> 02:31:47.40 You do the same thing.
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:48.40 You get actually positivity.
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:49.40 Exactly.
02:31:49.40 --> 02:31:50.40 It was actually better.
02:31:50.40 --> 02:31:53.68 What was weird was I kind of thought about it because I had a milkshake with a banana
02:31:53.68 --> 02:31:54.68 by the way.
02:31:54.68 --> 02:31:57.04 And the next house like man, last night I had that dessert.
02:31:57.04 --> 02:31:59.60 I was like, wait, the dessert wasn't something junk.
02:31:59.60 --> 02:32:00.60 It was something good.
02:32:00.60 --> 02:32:01.60 Yeah.
02:32:01.60 --> 02:32:02.60 So it's like you get the refreshing.
02:32:02.60 --> 02:32:04.60 You got a double positive hit.
02:32:04.60 --> 02:32:07.60 Actually, we're protein getting to your 0.7.
02:32:07.60 --> 02:32:08.60 Yeah, I guess.
02:32:08.60 --> 02:32:11.60 And then you got a guilt for not even guilt free, but positivity.
02:32:11.60 --> 02:32:12.60 Yeah.
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:17.60 So this is like across the board, win, win, front end back end, tactical strategic, all
02:32:17.60 --> 02:32:18.60 good stuff.
02:32:18.60 --> 02:32:19.60 Okay.
02:32:19.60 --> 02:32:20.60 Appreciate that.
02:32:20.60 --> 02:32:21.60 You got a bunch of other stuff there.

02:33:18.36 --> 02:33:19.36 Chain wide.
02:33:19.36 --> 02:33:21.80 Apparently there's some insurgency happening.
02:33:21.80 --> 02:33:30.20 Some other brands are trying to maneuver and they're getting ambushed.
02:33:30.20 --> 02:33:35.88 So I appreciate everyone going in there and just getting after it, clearing shelves.
02:33:35.88 --> 02:33:38.12 Yeah, and it tells kind of good story.

02:33:39.12 --> 02:33:41.12 Did Corey?
02:33:41.12 --> 02:33:42.96 He went in with a cooler.
02:33:42.96 --> 02:33:45.16 He literally cleared.
02:33:45.16 --> 02:33:46.16 He posted it.

02:35:35.40 --> 02:35:40.76 I don't like the word theme, but more disciplines that slanted skewed a pair of
02:35:40.76 --> 02:35:41.76 pair.
02:35:41.76 --> 02:35:42.76 Here's the thing.
02:35:42.76 --> 02:35:44.48 You do want to represent one when you're on the path.
02:35:44.48 --> 02:35:45.48 You do.
02:35:45.48 --> 02:35:49.08 Think about what you are representing, no.
02:35:49.08 --> 02:35:50.08 It's facing.
02:35:50.08 --> 02:35:53.96 You do run the risk of representing the same thing.
02:35:53.96 --> 02:35:58.04 Your neighbor across the street, who's not on the path, by the way.
02:35:58.04 --> 02:35:59.04 These are represented.
02:35:59.04 --> 02:36:00.04 Are you a deletes?
02:36:00.04 --> 02:36:01.04 No, no, no, no, no.
02:36:01.04 --> 02:36:02.04 Where's my neighbor across the street?
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:03.04 It's a badass.
02:36:03.04 --> 02:36:04.56 Well, then, okay, then there you go.
02:36:04.56 --> 02:36:05.56 That's cool.

02:36:06.96 --> 02:36:07.96 Got it.
02:36:07.96 --> 02:36:11.12 So, I'm saying, look, if you have discipline, you go to freedom, or you have good, or you
02:36:11.12 --> 02:36:14.52 have like one of the hoodies or something like this, you don't run that risk.
02:36:14.52 --> 02:36:17.88 You seem to say, so if you're going to represent on the path here, this is a good place
02:36:17.88 --> 02:36:20.96 to get this stuff, and it's a good move over.

02:40:00.20 --> 02:40:02.92 It's a, it's a knob.
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:04.24 Dave, assessment.
02:40:04.24 --> 02:40:05.56 You've read final spin.
02:40:05.56 --> 02:40:06.88 Oh, I have.
02:40:06.88 --> 02:40:07.88 Assessment.
02:40:07.88 --> 02:40:12.64 I'd actually kind of secretly want to know where I sit in the log of readers where I'm.
02:40:12.64 --> 02:40:14.36 I actually, I know what I haven't got.
02:40:14.36 --> 02:40:16.36 You haven't got you the final version.
02:40:16.36 --> 02:40:17.36 The final version.
02:40:17.36 --> 02:40:18.36 So I finally got it.
02:40:18.36 --> 02:40:21.04 It is not just a book.
02:40:21.04 --> 02:40:23.20 I can tell you that for sure.
02:40:23.20 --> 02:40:24.56 Interesting.
02:40:24.56 --> 02:40:27.56 It is, they're going to have a hard time figuring out where to put this one on the
02:40:27.56 --> 02:40:28.56 bookshelf.
02:40:28.56 --> 02:40:29.56 Yes.
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:31.48 They put it over there and they put it over there and the, yeah.
02:40:31.48 --> 02:40:32.48 Like where does it go?
02:40:32.48 --> 02:40:34.04 They have a hard time.
02:40:34.04 --> 02:40:41.68 My validation that it wasn't just me just digging what I was reading is I shared it with my
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:46.88 wife, which I got to be honest, I don't, there's not a lot of crossover in my world that
02:40:46.88 --> 02:40:47.88 I'm doing that.
02:40:47.88 --> 02:40:48.88 I don't share all this up with my wife.
02:40:48.88 --> 02:40:49.88 We got enough stuff going on.
02:40:49.88 --> 02:40:52.16 I don't like, you know, bum barger with the work stuff.
02:40:52.16 --> 02:40:53.96 You're not talking about battles in the bond soon.
02:40:53.96 --> 02:40:54.96 Nope.
02:40:54.96 --> 02:40:55.96 I'm not, how is the podcast?
02:40:55.96 --> 02:40:56.96 It was awesome.
02:40:56.96 --> 02:40:57.96 Okay, cool.
02:40:57.96 --> 02:40:58.96 What do I need to do around the house?
02:40:58.96 --> 02:40:59.96 How can I help?
02:40:59.96 --> 02:41:01.40 I know it's been gone for seven hours.
02:41:01.40 --> 02:41:04.44 I shared this with her and she just burned through it.
02:41:04.44 --> 02:41:08.28 I think in two days, you know, and burned through it was like 10 o'clock and I get's in the
02:41:08.28 --> 02:41:11.000 bed and she says up way too late and finishes in two nights.
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.68 She just like, that was really good.
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:16.52 That's when I knew like my version of it being good had to be validated by a totally
02:41:16.52 --> 02:41:20.88 disinterested third party with no bias.
02:41:20.88 --> 02:41:22.04 She was totally still.
02:41:22.04 --> 02:41:26.60 Well, interestingly, my mom.
02:41:26.60 --> 02:41:29.72 So you would think what you just said, like, oh, bias, right?
02:41:29.72 --> 02:41:32.04 You'd think, oh, I send it to my mom.
02:41:32.04 --> 02:41:34.12 That's a given, right?
02:41:34.12 --> 02:41:35.84 You know my mom.
02:41:35.84 --> 02:41:39.16 My mom knows like, it's because she was an English teacher.
02:41:39.16 --> 02:41:41.92 And so she's just there to just, she's just there.
02:41:41.92 --> 02:41:44.32 I would say throw darts, but she's not there to throw darts.
02:41:44.32 --> 02:41:46.92 She's there to hook machetes at your work.
02:41:46.92 --> 02:41:49.12 I got my work, right?
02:41:49.12 --> 02:41:56.08 And so I sent it to her for a final read and she sent me a text that said, like, halfway
02:41:56.08 --> 02:41:57.96 done, I am loving this book.
02:41:57.96 --> 02:41:59.24 That was complete shock.
02:41:59.24 --> 02:42:00.24 Yeah.
02:42:00.24 --> 02:42:05.52 In fact, I don't lay for about it because life was with me in New York City when extreme
02:42:05.52 --> 02:42:09.12 ownership made number number one New York Times bestseller.
02:42:09.12 --> 02:42:14.52 Which is like sort of the thing, the cool thing for a book, right?
02:42:14.52 --> 02:42:18.32 And I called my parents on speakerphone and, and, and,
02:42:18.32 --> 02:42:20.80 Lafes like Santa and their list, I'm like, hey, I just want to let you guys know, you
02:42:20.80 --> 02:42:25.12 know, we made New York Times bestseller and us, you know, with the book that I wrote with
02:42:25.12 --> 02:42:30.12 Lafes and my mom's like, oh, we'll see how long it's on their phone.
02:42:30.12 --> 02:42:32.12 I was like, cool.
02:42:32.12 --> 02:42:34.88 Yeah, I guess we will.
02:42:34.88 --> 02:42:36.76 So a positive review.
02:42:36.76 --> 02:42:37.76 Yeah.
