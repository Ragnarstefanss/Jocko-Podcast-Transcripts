[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 277 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, I
[00:00:06] go. Good evening. It is again impressed upon every officer and man of this command that
[00:00:14] ground once captured must under no circumstances be given up in the absence of direct, positive
[00:00:22] and formal orders to do so, emanating from these headquarters. Troops occupying ground
[00:00:30] must be supported against counter attack and all gains held. It is if favorite trick of the
[00:00:39] Germans to spread confusion by calling out retire or fall back. If inaction any such
[00:00:47] command is heard, officers and men may be sure that it is given by the enemy. Whoever
[00:00:56] gives such a command is a traitor and it is the duty of any officer or man who is loyal
[00:01:03] to his country and who hears such an order given to shoot the offender upon the spot.
[00:01:13] They are not going back but forward. So came the order from Major General Robert
[00:01:23] Alexander on the morning of September 26, 1918 at the beginning of the Muse Argonne
[00:01:33] Offensive World War I. A few days later, October 1, Major Charles White Wittlesy was given
[00:01:44] his orders. He was to advance north up the Argonne ravine, go across a brook and take
[00:01:53] Charlottesville mill and the purpose was to get control of this mill from which a nearby
[00:01:58] road and nearby rail line could be controlled. I want to say that completed. They were to push
[00:02:05] on to heal 198 to be to complete a flanking maneuver on the enemy. This is salt. Started
[00:02:15] on October 2. The man woke up eight breakfast and commenced to fighting by the evening
[00:02:26] of October 2. Major Wittlesley got reports that his men had found a way up hill 1,198.
[00:02:35] So they attacked. Got control of the hill. Got control of the hill with men from battalions
[00:02:45] of the 307th and 308th infantry regiments of the 154th infantry brigade 77th division.
[00:02:53] Now once he got control of this hill, didn't receive any communication from the French unit
[00:02:59] that was supposed to be protecting his left flank and no communication from an American
[00:03:03] unit that was supposed to be protecting his right flank. And it's World War I. There's
[00:03:11] no radios or anything where the flanks had collapsed. He didn't know this, but the Germans
[00:03:15] had taken the ground. Wittlesley and his men dug in. Created a defensive position on that
[00:03:26] hill which became known as the pocket. At about 2230 that night, Wittlesley realized
[00:03:35] the Germans were on hill 205 and they were in the ravine off to his right. The morning
[00:03:43] of October 3, Wittlesley sent out runners to his flanks to establish communications
[00:03:50] find out where these American and French units were. That's what you did in World War.
[00:03:55] One, when you know what was happening, you didn't have radios to call, so you sent runners
[00:03:58] or you sent carrier pigeons. So he sends out the runners to the left and right flank,
[00:04:08] known of them come back. Since carrier pigeons with various messages about their position
[00:04:16] and situations, receives no communication back. And he comes to the realization that they
[00:04:26] must be completely surrounded. On the afternoon of October 3, the Germans attacked from all
[00:04:39] sides. One of the American company commanders, a guy named Captain Holderman, let a break
[00:04:47] out to try and connect with allied forces took massive casualties and the breakout was
[00:04:55] stopped so they're surrounded and stuck. And the Germans attacked with mortars to get the
[00:05:05] heads down and then got closer and attacked with grenades. Then the Americans held.
[00:05:16] And as evening approached, the Germans backed off because while the Germans were assaulting,
[00:05:23] not only did they cause massive casualties, they received massive casualties. On the
[00:05:32] morning of four October, the major, major whittles, he was worried that no one knew what
[00:05:39] his situation was. There was massive casualties. And then they began getting sheld. But
[00:05:49] they began getting sheld by their own artillery. And he has one last carrier pigeon left.
[00:05:59] And he launches it. And this last carrier pigeon arrives at headquarters. It's been shot
[00:06:04] through the breast. It's been blinded one eye. And it's got one leg hanging on by a tendon.
[00:06:13] And the message says, we are along the road parallel to 276.4. Our own artillery is dropping
[00:06:21] a barrage directly on us for heaven's sake. Stop it. So the artillery stops. And then
[00:06:37] the Germans attack again. And they're driven back once again. And there's again mass casualties
[00:06:44] on both sides, except for that the Americans are running low on ammunition. They don't
[00:06:52] have any food. The one water source that they had close by exposed them to German fire. And
[00:07:03] so this continues on the fifth and the sixth of October. Attack after attack, the wounded in
[00:07:14] the dead pile up. And on the seventh of October the Germans send a blind folded American
[00:07:20] POW forward carrying a white flag. And he has a note with him. And the note is directed
[00:07:32] to the commanding officer of the Americans. And it says, the suffering of your wounded men
[00:07:40] can be heard over here in the German lines. And we are appealing to your humane sentiments to stop.
[00:07:50] The white flag shown by one of your men will tell us that you agree with these conditions.
[00:07:55] Please treat private lowl are hauling sheds, the bearer of this note as an honorable man.
[00:08:07] He's quite a soldier. We envy you.
[00:08:13] Signed the German commanding officer.
[00:08:16] And major, whittles the allegedly replied, you go to hell.
[00:08:30] So they honkered down and they braised for more attacks. And then that night a relief
[00:08:38] force arrived and the Germans finally retreated. And of the 554 troops that originally attacked,
[00:08:49] that hill, 190 wounded, 63 were missing and 17 were killed. Only 194 were able to walk out.
[00:09:03] They became known as the lost battalion. There were seven medals of honor awarded for this action,
[00:09:20] including one two major Charles W. Whittlesley, who was immediately promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:09:35] And if you are tracking the dates here, this was an October of 1918, and the war ended
[00:09:40] a little over a month later November 11th, 1918, and this became in America, one of the most
[00:09:47] publicized events of the war. So the war ends in November of 1918. In 1919,
[00:10:00] there's a movie came out. The movie was called the Lost Battalion. Whittlesley himself
[00:10:08] was in the film, playing himself.
[00:10:10] And it's a silent film. You can go watch it. You can see him. You can see him reenacting
[00:10:21] these events. And he tried to go back to civilian life. He's now out of the army
[00:10:30] and he's smart and he's educated. He's has a law degree from Harvard and he added his own law
[00:10:37] partnership before the war. But obviously things had changed. And one thing that had changed was
[00:10:54] a movie star and a hero and there was this constant demand for speeches and there were
[00:11:00] parades for him and interviews and the star to wear on him and in November of 1921,
[00:11:11] he served as a Paul Bear at the burial of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Semitary.
[00:11:19] And a few days later, he booked a trip on a ship from New York to Havana, a ship called the SS
[00:11:37] to Lowa. And he set sail on November 26, 1921. And that night he had dinner.
[00:11:52] He chatted with some people about 1130 that night. He left for his state room.
[00:11:59] And in the morning, the stewards knocked on his door to going to his cabin and no one answered
[00:12:11] to the entered his cabin so they could clean. And they found a note. And the note said
[00:12:23] to the captain of the SS to Lowa. Deer Sir, my name is Charles W. Wittlesy,
[00:12:37] 14 Wall Street, New York City. I'm enclosing some money and my watch.
[00:12:45] Please give $10 to each of the deck stewards, the room stewards and the table steward.
[00:12:51] To duck what is necessary for sending the enclosed wireless messages and send my balance to my
[00:12:59] executor John B. Pruehn to Rector Street, New York City.
[00:13:05] Please throw my suitcases and close overboard. I don't want anything returned.
[00:13:12] And I'm writing my father that I'm making this request of you.
[00:13:16] Here are the messages I would very much appreciate you sending. One, Frank R. Wittlesley,

[00:14:02] Alysha Wittlesley, 136 East 44 Street, New York City. Your brother, Charles Wittlesley,

[00:14:34] I am very sorry to bother you with these unpleasant details.
[00:14:46] Cyan Charles W. Wittlesley.
[00:15:07] His body was never recovered and they put a stone for him in the military cemetery in
[00:15:16] Pitsfield Massachusetts that reads in memory of Charles W.
[00:15:20] Wittlesley Lieutenant Colonel US Army World War I 1884 to 1921.
[00:15:26] Metal of Honor.
[00:15:46] And that's that.
[00:15:51] Hero and the tragedy and you can't help but ask yourself how does this happen.
[00:16:02] How does the story of heroism and camaraderie encourage how does that turn into a story of
[00:16:09] despair and loneliness and loss of hope?
[00:16:17] And what can we learn from that story?
[00:16:19] How can we learn to avoid that tragedy and move away from the darkest and move toward the light?
[00:16:33] And here tonight to discuss that with us.
[00:16:41] There's one of the few people in the world that can have some semblance of understanding
[00:16:47] of that story of what Colonel Wittlesley went through.
[00:16:55] His name is Dakota Meyer and if you don't know who he is then just stop listening right
[00:16:58] now and go listen to podcast number 115.
[00:17:04] Dakota Meyer is a Marine.
[00:17:05] He's a sniper.
[00:17:06] He's a father.
[00:17:08] He's a recipient of the Metal of Honor.
[00:17:13] He's one of my heroes.
[00:17:16] My most important is one of my friends.
[00:17:21] Dakota.
[00:17:23] Thanks for coming down man.
[00:17:26] Thanks for having me.
[00:17:28] Man.
[00:17:31] That's, you know, that hits home.
[00:17:38] You know I was listening to the last time you were on this podcast.
[00:17:42] And we basically kind of closed it out after you received the Metal of Honor.
[00:17:48] I mean we went just a little bit past it.
[00:17:50] But you know since then, you and I have talked about things that are going on and what
[00:17:59] it was like after that.
[00:18:01] And you know as I read through that story of Colonel Wittlesley, you can see there's
[00:18:11] definite parallels.
[00:18:12] Oh, I mean it's, yeah I mean like why you were reading it.
[00:18:18] I mean like I was like tearing up because like I could just, I could feel how lonely
[00:18:26] that guy was.
[00:18:29] You know it's, yeah.
[00:18:33] I mean you know, how do you, yeah I mean there's, like what do you do the rest of
[00:18:40] your life?
[00:18:41] You know like what do you, what do you do the rest of your life?
[00:18:45] You know like yeah you can keep going and giving back.
[00:18:47] But it's also a lonely road because you know everybody's sitting here just, first off
[00:18:55] you don't know why they're around you.
[00:18:57] You know and then you don't know and everybody loves to just like they just want to
[00:19:04] watch you fail.
[00:19:06] You know what I mean so that they can in their mind make themselves feel better.
[00:19:09] And it's like everything you do is criticized.
[00:19:12] And I just, I mean just with how that guy did it, it's just he did it on his terms.
[00:19:19] You know it's like it's a, yeah I mean it's a lonely road.
[00:19:25] I mean it's a lonely road and it's not just, it's not just, yeah I mean I'm nothing special.
[00:19:33] I don't look at myself as anything, as anything special.
[00:19:37] I did what I trained to do, I did what I put hope into people to do if they were in that
[00:19:43] situation.
[00:19:45] But you know it's just and it's, and honestly I think it's even worse today with everybody
[00:19:51] being able to, to watch how you live your life.
[00:19:55] Like more people have their eyes on you right?
[00:19:57] Like you know you get a guy who goes out and deals with PTSD or whatever you struggle
[00:20:04] in that day.
[00:20:05] I mean I'm scared, I won't even go, like I remember when I call my doctors if I need
[00:20:10] to go talk to somebody at therapist or something like I come up with a route of how I can
[00:20:14] go in the back door so nobody sees me so that they can publicize, oh look, look there's
[00:20:18] the code of going like there's something wrong with them.
[00:20:21] You know what I mean?
[00:20:22] Like it's just the standards are not, the grounds not equal now and it's just, yeah I mean.
[00:20:30] But also like you get a choice every day is a choice and it's like am I going to take this
[00:20:37] and try to get back and continue using the things that made me successful in that moment
[00:20:43] and apply it somewhere else.
[00:20:45] You know like the most of the film and I get is my daughters and whenever I'm trying to
[00:20:50] help people as a firefighter, like it's been the best thing for me.
[00:20:54] Like I'll, I'll never forget I, there was this guy and I, I talked about in the book,
[00:20:59] there was this was one of the first times I felt, if I felt real again almost and I'd
[00:21:07] help this guy and he didn't know who I was.
[00:21:10] He didn't know me for what I'd done.
[00:21:12] He didn't know my name.
[00:21:13] I was just a guy in the uniform and there when he needed help and he like thanked me and
[00:21:17] was so appreciative and I was like that feels good.
[00:21:21] That feels good.
[00:21:22] He didn't have any, any assumption of who I was or how I was.
[00:21:27] You know what I mean? Like that guy just needed that moment and I could be there for
[00:21:30] him and it shows me that I still got it.
[00:21:33] That I still got it.
[00:21:35] You know, because I mean you get off and like how long do you get out of the military?
[00:21:39] We've talked about this.
[00:21:42] How long do you get out of the military and you can still, you can still walk around with
[00:21:48] this, I'm a warrior, but you haven't even had to get in the ring.
[00:21:53] How long does that credibility still give you? I'm a warrior today.
[00:21:58] Not I was a warrior, but I am a warrior.
[00:22:01] How long do you get that credibility without getting in the ring?
[00:22:05] You know?
[00:22:06] And it's always a struggle.
[00:22:08] That's always a struggle is, do I still have it?
[00:22:13] Could I still do it?
[00:22:15] Could I still perform at that level?
[00:22:18] Because at the day you can't, you have to say I was a warrior.
[00:22:25] And it's like, I mean you have to be tested.
[00:22:30] And that's the one thing you talk to David Goggins, like that guy, he test himself all the
[00:22:34] time.
[00:22:35] He's always pushing it.
[00:22:37] But that's like, yeah, I mean that's the struggle is it's like, could I still?
[00:22:42] In the further I get away from that day in Afghanistan, you know, like I question myself
[00:22:47] all the time of, did I?
[00:22:50] How could I have done that that day?
[00:22:52] But like today I don't, to tell you I can't even, you know, get myself to have an up
[00:22:58] discipline to go work out.
[00:23:01] What happened to me?
[00:23:04] Do you know?
[00:23:06] So when you get done, like how long did it take for the, for the damn ceremonies and the
[00:23:16] round of interview, I remember you and I were talking on the phone, I forget when, but
[00:23:22] you were talking about like you were on 60 minutes, you were on all the, like every, what
[00:23:26] freaking lettermen, you did everything.
[00:23:28] How long did that last four?
[00:23:32] You know, like I was, I was like, it was really crazy all the way up to, I got it in September
[00:23:38] 15th of 2011.
[00:23:41] Through December it was crazy.
[00:23:43] I mean, I was on the view 60 minutes CBS Sunday morning, Fox all the time, I was on, obviously
[00:23:50] Letterman, J. Leno, I mean, you got everything.
[00:23:54] You got down down a list.
[00:23:57] And it was, I mean, it was crazy.
[00:23:59] It was crazy.
[00:24:00] And it's still like speeches kept going, like, I mean, you still walk out places and
[00:24:05] people recognize you and, you know, everybody's coming at you and wanting you and this and that.
[00:24:10] And it was, it took me, I got hated it.
[00:24:13] I was, I mean, I, when I hear people say, hey, I met you back in, but anytime I'm like,
[00:24:17] when you meet me, and people was between 2011 and 2014, I apologize.
[00:24:22] First, I said, I'm sorry.
[00:24:24] I'm sorry.
[00:24:25] I was drunk the whole time.
[00:24:26] I hated it.
[00:24:27] I got hated it.
[00:24:28] Like there would be times, it like, so I had a whole team around me.
[00:24:32] The Marine Corps sent, like right after a day and now I'm starting to get in the middle.
[00:24:36] The Marine Corps sent out like seven people to live with me, 24, 7.
[00:24:42] What would they, what would they do with it?
[00:24:45] I had a security guy that stayed in my house.
[00:24:49] Like he stayed, I wasn't anywhere by myself for probably 90 days, at least 120 days.
[00:24:58] And a guy live with me.
[00:25:01] They sent in like, there were PR people, PAO people.
[00:25:06] There was three of them, and you're 23 years old.
[00:25:10] Twenty-three years old.
[00:25:12] How was Ty and Steve?
[00:25:13] There's, there's, there's interviews.
[00:25:15] You go on the internet and there's interviews.
[00:25:18] So they sent divids out, right?
[00:25:19] So like the DOD, the Marine Corps, like combat camera people, like capturing this.
[00:25:25] There are images of like, I, I refuse.
[00:25:27] I'm like, no, it's not changing my life.
[00:25:30] And I'm literally on a skid steer, like working under a skid steer and they're interviewing
[00:25:33] me because they had to get something and I would not stop.
[00:25:37] I'm like, no, you can follow me, but that's it.
[00:25:39] So they would get up and follow me to go work at yards and stuff all day long.
[00:25:44] But yeah, I mean, so I had all that.
[00:25:45] And I mean, it was just like a, you know, my whole life changed.
[00:25:50] And, and then, you know, it like everything was good.
[00:25:54] It's like they built me up.
[00:25:55] Like, I was, I couldn't do anything wrong.
[00:25:59] And it's like when they got you to the top of the mountain, it was like the pinniat
[00:26:03] that they raised up.
[00:26:04] And then it was just like, here came the media, just as soon as you said something wrong.
[00:26:08] Or, I mean, they were just, it's the gotchas.
[00:26:11] And it was like, it was like, they just build you up to just try to smash you down, right?
[00:26:15] And there was always this one reporter who was there.
[00:26:20] They just always want to take me to task.
[00:26:22] So it's like, you just got, you had to, you just start, you take these beatons, right?
[00:26:26] And, and like, you know, like, people like, all do cares.
[00:26:29] Who cares what they say about you?
[00:26:31] Well, there's only one thing I've gotten this life.
[00:26:35] And that's my name and reputation.
[00:26:37] That's the only, like, when I die on my tombstone, it's not going to have any of my awards.
[00:26:44] It's not going to have anything, but the day I was born and the day I died, and it's
[00:26:49] going to say, myr at the top of it.
[00:26:52] And that's what people are going to know.
[00:26:54] But that's my brand.
[00:26:56] And so I took it serious, like, when I would come home and I remember I landed one
[00:27:01] night and I landed really late in Louisville.
[00:27:05] And I was driving home and the career journal had released on the front page across the
[00:27:13] state, because I remember I pulled into this gas station in my hometown.
[00:27:16] And it was across the state.
[00:27:17] And it was metal of this honor with my page on the front page of the state paper, right?
[00:27:23] And they were trying to spread it everything that I had done.
[00:27:26] And it was so bad that my friends got up.
[00:27:30] Like they found out about it.
[00:27:32] And they got up and they went and bought all the papers out in town.
[00:27:37] And it was just always something man.
[00:27:38] And it's just like, you just can't, there's no rhyme or reason to it.
[00:27:45] You know, and it's just a, yeah, I mean, you get isolated.
[00:27:51] So I get, I get what that guy said.
[00:27:53] You know, what that guy did.
[00:27:58] I mean, sometimes you just, you know, what if I can't help people and make a difference,
[00:28:04] what am I doing?
[00:28:06] What are you doing?
[00:28:09] So you say the like the hype train lasted from September to December.
[00:28:15] And I mean, at some point, does all the sudden, those seven Marines that were there
[00:28:18] watching their remove all sudden, like their, their duties over, we got my, are done with
[00:28:24] whatever he need to get done.
[00:28:26] Yeah. And then like one day you wake up and like, they're alone.
[00:28:30] Yeah. So we were supposed to go to, so we did at East Coast West Coast, and we're supposed
[00:28:35] to Hawaii tour.
[00:28:36] So it's like a, we were like a weekend in New York.
[00:28:40] And then a week in California.
[00:28:42] And then we were supposed to go to Hawaii for like a week to do press and all this,
[00:28:46] right, see the bases and do the press on each coast.
[00:28:50] And we went to New York.
[00:28:53] Did that. So like I got the medal, came home.
[00:28:57] And then the week after that, this was when all this started.
[00:29:01] And by the time I hit California, I'm like, I'm out.
[00:29:06] Like I, I'm on the plane to California from New York to California.
[00:29:08] I said, I can't, I'm out.
[00:29:10] I can't keep doing this.
[00:29:11] Um, and so that was it.
[00:29:14] Like, what was it that made you feel like you're like, the people just constantly talking
[00:29:18] to you. I mean, was it just, you feel like you're put up on a pedestal.
[00:29:22] We talked about this the first time you're on here.
[00:29:25] I mean, basically everyone's saying, hey, good job.
[00:29:30] I mean, you got to take this like, I am literally known for the biggest failure of my life.
[00:29:39] Like you, you can't change the narrative to like, that's where people get wrongness
[00:29:46] or like, well, like they just defy stuff in their head.
[00:29:50] The facts are this like you can't change the facts.
[00:29:53] All my team is dead.
[00:29:55] Like I didn't get them out.
[00:29:57] Whether it was rational or not.
[00:30:00] Somebody can say, I'm gonna do 10,000 push-ups today and they're trying to break
[00:30:04] against book a world record.
[00:30:06] Nobody looks at him and says, well, you did, you did 500 in hour.
[00:30:10] That's good enough.
[00:30:11] They failed.
[00:30:13] I failed.
[00:30:16] My team answered dead.
[00:30:17] Their families has, unanswered questions.
[00:30:20] There's, there's four kids that don't ever see their dad.
[00:30:26] And I'm getting preyed around the nation as a hero.
[00:30:32] And it's like I look at all these other mental, like all the other mental alarmers guys.
[00:30:36] And I'm away from them because, you know, I get, look, call carpentry.
[00:30:41] I couldn't imagine what that kid got through.
[00:30:43] Like you talk about a guy that's a warrior.
[00:30:45] That kid's a warrior.
[00:30:47] I don't have anything like that.
[00:30:50] But I tell these guys that like, you guys did some bad-ass stuff.
[00:30:57] You guys did bad-ass stuff.
[00:31:01] And you got some guys that enjoy it with.
[00:31:04] I come home and I ain't got anybody.
[00:31:08] And it's literally the biggest failure of my life.
[00:31:10] Now with that I've learned a lot.
[00:31:13] And I can't change the narrative because it doesn't feel good.
[00:31:18] And you started, you started feeling this way while you're flying from New York, California.
[00:31:22] Like, I mean, I, I told the president that I couldn't accept the metal.
[00:31:26] I wanted him to break it down to a Navy Cross.
[00:31:28] I told him I couldn't accept the metal because like he said, you're, I'll never forget
[00:31:34] President Obama told me that I was a hero.
[00:31:36] And I said, if you think I'm such a hero, why don't you call my teammates up and get
[00:31:41] their opinion, go let them know I'm a hero.
[00:31:46] And I'm not.
[00:31:48] And that's why like, that's why when these people are like trying to discredit or they're
[00:31:52] trying to say, oh, you know, whatever, I mean, I can't argue with them.
[00:31:56] I, you talk about getting my ass kicked.
[00:31:59] Like I got a metal of honor for getting my ass kicked.
[00:32:04] And so I just, I couldn't keep living this in the media of like, it just, it was a
[00:32:10] hard thing like, I just wasn't there yet, right?
[00:32:13] Now I don't do it about me.
[00:32:15] I do it about my teammates, right?
[00:32:17] Like I do it to try to show these lessons.
[00:32:21] If, hey, you know, I come to this point to where I wasn't going to change it.
[00:32:25] I wasn't going to be able to get away from it.
[00:32:27] You know, it was like, and so how do I use it to make a difference?
[00:32:32] How do I try to turn something so terrible into something good?
[00:32:36] And that's what I ended up having to do.
[00:32:37] But yeah, I got off like on the plane to, it was on the plane to L.A.
[00:32:41] It was on the plane from New York to L.A.
[00:32:43] And I remember looking at the girl who was running all my stuff.
[00:32:47] She was, she's a rock star.
[00:32:48] You talk about a girl who she is a rock star.
[00:32:52] And I said, we were done.
[00:32:56] We're done.
[00:32:57] We'll finish these interviews here, but we're not going to lie.
[00:33:00] And I'm going home.
[00:33:01] And landed.
[00:33:03] We did the stuff we had doing in L.A.
[00:33:05] I flew home from there.
[00:33:08] And then I was still doing events and still doing what people wanted me to.
[00:33:12] I had a scholarship fund with the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation.
[00:33:15] I had this challenge to America where we would raise a million dollars to put kids
[00:33:20] through college.
[00:33:21] So like I was going out and speaking of events for that to like go into private dinners
[00:33:26] to where somebody would write a huge check to the scholarship foundation.
[00:33:29] So I was doing that.
[00:33:30] And then yeah, no, I didn't have any, nobody taught me.
[00:33:35] What I should do, what I shouldn't do, you know, it was like 23 years old just thrown
[00:33:41] to this machine that, I mean, I didn't even have an Instagram at the time.
[00:33:47] Right?
[00:33:48] Like I didn't know what to do.
[00:33:49] And so yeah, I mean, I did that.
[00:33:53] I was on the speaking, like I did speaking with leading authorities.
[00:33:57] Broke my book with being West in 2012.
[00:34:01] And you know, like speeches kept going and like events and things like that.
[00:34:04] And but you just kind of just kind of going with the flow of what's next, right?
[00:34:11] And yeah, I didn't see it.
[00:34:13] Was the Marine Corps when you said, hey, look, I'm not going to Hawaii.
[00:34:16] Where I'm done.
[00:34:17] I'm done.
[00:34:18] Was the Marine Corps thinking or did anybody say, okay, hey, maybe we need to give Dakota some
[00:34:25] help to get through this because he's got a massive amount of guilt over what happened.
[00:34:31] Did anybody talk to you along those lines at all?
[00:34:34] So the Marine Corps didn't know what to do either.
[00:34:37] Right?
[00:34:38] Like I was the first living Marine since Vietnam to receive the Medal of Honor.
[00:34:43] So they weren't really schooled up on it either.
[00:34:47] And there was one mistake that they made from the beginning is, and they tried to put it
[00:34:56] together.
[00:34:57] But when they put the narrative together, this is what opened us up to the media to the
[00:35:02] guy who actually was the reporter that was actually the one that just was trying to
[00:35:09] discredit everything.
[00:35:11] And this was his heart.
[00:35:12] This is a piece of your hand on.
[00:35:14] But like in the first initial write up they had to do, right?
[00:35:20] They put numbers in of how many people were rescued or say, whatever you want to call it.
[00:35:27] And how many people I killed?
[00:35:31] Which opened it up to numbers, which a doesn't matter, and b opens it up.
[00:35:39] Right?
[00:35:40] Because it doesn't really matter.
[00:35:41] Did you kill 28 people or 72 people or 172 people?
[00:35:46] It's like it doesn't really matter.
[00:35:47] Wait, wait.
[00:35:48] Did you save?
[00:35:49] Because you can get a Medal of Honor for saving one person.
[00:35:52] You can get a Medal of Honor for killing one person.
[00:35:55] You can get a Medal of Honor for saving 100 or killing 100.
[00:35:58] That's not what it's about.
[00:35:59] But if they opened it up for that, all of a sudden they make it matter.
[00:36:03] And that was where it messed up.
[00:36:06] And I think they started the negative stuff started coming out.
[00:36:10] And that was where.
[00:36:11] But like the reporter even says in his article, there's an article out there about
[00:36:15] how it was quite a few.
[00:36:17] But he even states he goes, he states all these things, these discrepancies.
[00:36:24] But he goes, I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.
[00:36:28] I actually read that article.
[00:36:29] He said he says something along the lines of not that these actions alone don't fully
[00:36:35] warrant the Medal of Honor.
[00:36:36] So what the hell are you doing?
[00:36:39] Yeah.
[00:36:40] So it's those things that like, you know, I got like me and like you, you've had to talk
[00:36:45] me down.
[00:36:46] I got like me all I've known my whole life.
[00:36:50] Like there's only one thing I'm good at.
[00:36:53] And it's fighting.
[00:36:54] It's all I know.
[00:36:55] Like I have been, it's all I know.
[00:36:59] You know what I mean?
[00:37:00] Like it's the only thing that's made me successful anything is that I was willing to fight
[00:37:04] and I was willing to work.
[00:37:06] And you put those things in a spot where there's people who are poking.
[00:37:14] It's not a good thing, right?
[00:37:19] And so like I had to back up, you know, get myself together.
[00:37:23] I was drinking too much like I was just trying to deal with all of it.
[00:37:26] I mean, imagine walking into a room and everybody wants to talk to you about the worst
[00:37:30] day of your life.
[00:37:33] Like over and over and over and it's like you don't have to.
[00:37:39] It's not about going home and not dreaming about it.
[00:37:42] It's about I'm walking into rooms and I'm sitting here literally reliving it over and over
[00:37:49] which is okay.
[00:37:55] But I just think that like sometimes the worst day of my life is somebody else's entertainment.
[00:38:02] I wish I would have pulled this quote major wittlessly.
[00:38:07] He was at like a dinner and spoke at the dinner.
[00:38:09] He sits down with his friends and the friends were talking.
[00:38:11] They said something along the lines of he said exactly what you just said.
[00:38:18] He said something along the lines of every time I talk about this, I go right back there
[00:38:25] and I can't get away from it.
[00:38:27] Yeah, like yeah, I mean, I just, I mean, look, I still today, I miss my guys.
[00:38:37] I mean, you know, I just seen that one of my, like one of my teammates, his daughters,
[00:38:45] you know, she's about to have a baby and you know, you just, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:38:51] You know what I mean?
[00:38:52] It's like, I get to sit here and enjoy my two beautiful daughters who are more than I ever
[00:38:57] deserve.
[00:38:58] I get to hang around such amazing people and I get to live a beautiful life and all these
[00:39:04] things and, you know, it's just it's not, it's not a fair world, you know?
[00:39:12] It's not.
[00:39:13] That's, that was always a thing, you know, struggle for me to deal with and, you know,
[00:39:17] and how do you give back, how do you continue to give back, right?
[00:39:20] Like what?
[00:39:21] Look, I mean, yeah, how do you get back, right?
[00:39:25] So yeah, so like the Marine Corps left, they went on their own way.
[00:39:28] Honestly, they kind of separated from me.
[00:39:30] I didn't hear much from them again.
[00:39:34] Probably two and a half, two and a half years.
[00:39:36] I didn't hear much from them.
[00:39:38] It was like mission complete for them.
[00:39:40] It was like, hey, let's separate from this because I don't know if this thing's going to
[00:39:42] be a hangar-nade or, you know, what's going to happen?
[00:39:46] Isn't it weird, you know, you said earlier, like, for this guy, you said it's worse today,
[00:39:52] right?
[00:39:53] Because everyone, there's, you know, word travel so fast and all this stuff.
[00:39:58] But you would think, man, like, that least people understand the concept of survivor guilt
[00:40:05] and post-traumatic stress, like at least we understand those things.
[00:40:11] And yet, it seems like, you know, if I, when someone goes through something like this,
[00:40:16] you've got to like give them some support, you know?
[00:40:18] Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:40:22] But you know, like, how do you do that when everybody looks at you like a hero?
[00:40:27] I mean, how many times have you been in a situation with a group of people knowing them
[00:40:33] well that you all, you're all scared as it gets?
[00:40:38] And, but it's like, as long as you keep your poker face on, you could literally be the
[00:40:44] thing that breaks them, where everybody's going to be like, no, you just confirmed their
[00:40:50] fears or you, you are the thing that keeps them going.
[00:40:55] And, you know, I, I just always took it as, this is my, I got the medal.
[00:41:08] And that's my punishment for letting my teammates get killed.
[00:41:14] This is my punishment to be paraded in front of all the people as a hero, the exact opposite
[00:41:21] of what I am.
[00:41:22] And that was, that was my punishment.
[00:41:25] That was what the universe or God, whoever you want to think about, this was, this was
[00:41:30] what I got for failing that day.
[00:41:35] And that was, that was kind of how it was, you know.
[00:41:40] And so like any time I got to give a speech or talk to people and tell them the realities
[00:41:44] of it, you know, I just wanted to know that hey, look, you can get your ass kicked and
[00:41:47] get back up from it.
[00:41:49] And that's what the story is.
[00:41:51] My story is not a story of a guy who is some high speed, low drag.
[00:41:57] You know, my story is a story of a guy who got his ass kicked and his hat is ass kicked,
[00:42:03] his whole life and has, who lives a life of success.
[00:42:09] He has found a way to make success out of a shit ton of failures.
[00:42:15] And that's kind of, that's kind of what it is, you know.
[00:42:19] But yeah, the Marine Corps went away and then I started hiring my own people.
[00:42:22] He was a hired new old people, kind of people.
[00:42:24] So like I had agents, right?
[00:42:27] So I had a book agent, a book and movie agent with ICM Sloan Sloan Harris.
[00:42:33] It was a great guy.
[00:42:35] I had, you know, obviously with the speaking agency, I had security people like that
[00:42:42] I would keep on me and not really for anything other than to protect me from myself, right?
[00:42:47] Like, because you know, I walked in, I mean, I would walk in somewhere and like, we'd
[00:42:52] be drinking and somebody would say something, I would hit him.
[00:42:55] You know what?
[00:42:57] That's a lawsuit now.
[00:42:58] You know what I mean?
[00:43:00] I had, you know, assistance, I mean, you know, people who were kind of handled me to
[00:43:04] get me what I need to be.
[00:43:06] I mean, it was, it was a crazy, it was a crazy time.
[00:43:10] I mean, it was crazy.
[00:43:12] And that was all the way up until probably 2014.
[00:43:16] And then, and then I just, I kind of just, I was like, I just want to get away from it.
[00:43:20] And I started backing off.
[00:43:21] And you know, I was so fortunate that I've been with Toyota since 2011.
[00:43:25] And you know, you talk about Ed Loutkiss and you talk about Don Esman and you talk about,
[00:43:30] like, all these incredible people inside of Toyota, like these people, like met me and
[00:43:37] they've mentored me the whole way.
[00:43:38] Like you talk about sticking with me through thick and thin and believing in a cause of,
[00:43:43] of, you know, of helping veterans and just, like you take them out of, out of, you know,
[00:43:51] if I had to met them in 2012, there's no time where I'd be.
[00:43:57] So those guys were kind of helping you guy, guy, do you through all this?
[00:44:01] And former Marines.
[00:44:03] So Don Esman was a Marine.
[00:44:04] He was a Vietnam pilot and Vietnam.
[00:44:06] He was a Metavac pilot.
[00:44:09] So he's got over 900 missions shot down Silver Star recipient.
[00:44:13] I mean, but he was, he was the, I think it was the COO of Toyota.
[00:44:21] And we, you know, I got in contact with them and they brought me on.
[00:44:27] They, they got what this program called hiring or heroes that I work with and helping veterans
[00:44:32] get back to work and, but it was more personal for them.
[00:44:37] It wasn't a business thing for them.
[00:44:38] Like they took me in and, you know, Ed Lakis, his mom and dad both were in World War II and
[00:44:45] Marines.
[00:44:46] And so it was just like, it was crazy how I got there, Tune.
[00:44:50] And they, you know, gosh, you talk about 2011, 2012 Dakota.
[00:44:55] Yeah, yeah, yeah, because that when you were the hand grenade that the Marine called
[00:45:00] this scared you were.
[00:45:02] Yes, you, you, you, you take those people out of my life, you know, John Lisco.
[00:45:08] And they didn't have to do it.
[00:45:11] And, you know, you just find these people.
[00:45:13] Yeah, you know, when you say these people, like, helped you out, there's always people
[00:45:19] that ask me, hey, how can we help veterans?
[00:45:23] And you know, it's really easy to say, like, give to charity, which is awesome for sure.
[00:45:27] But in terms of what is helpful and what you're talking about is like, actually form relationships
[00:45:35] with people so that you can see where you can help them and you can provide them the help
[00:45:39] and support that they need.
[00:45:40] Yeah.
[00:45:41] There's a big difference between me right in a check and saying, okay, I feel better
[00:45:44] about myself because I wrote a check to whatever foundation, which again, that's good.
[00:45:49] But if you want to go next level, form some relationships with some people and look,
[00:45:55] veterans have, especially like you, like me when I was young, right?
[00:46:00] You have no, I didn't really have any experience in the world, right?
[00:46:02] I was institutionalized.
[00:46:03] It was just, I just knew the military, that's me, that's my life.
[00:46:07] So if I would have gotten out when I was 23, 24 years old, I would know what to do.
[00:46:14] So someone that's a civilian, that's a little older.
[00:46:17] If you form a relationship with someone and look, I can tell you, it's not going to be
[00:46:23] easy.
[00:46:24] I can almost guarantee that being trying to mentor a guide 23 year old, the color,
[00:46:30] there's going to be challenges like it's like having a free continued boy.
[00:46:36] That's old enough to drink and has money.
[00:46:38] Yeah.
[00:46:39] Yes.
[00:46:40] Yeah.
[00:46:41] And that was it, right?
[00:46:43] You know, you talk about Ed, I mean, I go back, keep talking about Ed Larkis and
[00:46:48] you talk about a guy who just, I mean, he was like a second dad, you know what I mean?
[00:46:52] Like he, you know, it's wife Karen, just, I mean, I actually, I just call her mom, you know?
[00:46:57] And you talk about Ed, you know, they went out of their way and I was so lucky.
[00:47:00] But you know, that's the one thing that I have to say, if I've ever been good at, you know,
[00:47:06] all the way growing up, I've always been able to find, um, great.
[00:47:13] Like I've always had this way of finding great people and knowing who good people were,
[00:47:18] who I should try to be like, I was really good at figuring those out and making them believe
[00:47:24] in me, right?
[00:47:25] Like I was, that that's the only, that's the only power I really have is, is that I can,
[00:47:31] I know who's, who's really good in the room and who's, who's, who I should be like.
[00:47:37] And I find a way to get them to help get me there.
[00:47:41] And then always having great mentors, I've had that from day one.
[00:47:46] I've been, I've been so fortunate to have that, right?
[00:47:50] And that's what's got me, I mean, even still today, even still today, that's the pieces
[00:47:54] that keep me going and keep getting me better and keep helping me grow and learn and develop.
[00:48:00] You know, and that's, that's been my key to success or whatever you call it to, to still being
[00:48:05] here, right?
[00:48:07] Is those people, you know, I'm just a, I'm just a product of the people who are around me.
[00:48:15] They should get the credit for any success as I have, you know, and that's how it is.
[00:48:22] So when you, when you, in the book into the fire, you, you, by me, you had the lowest
[00:48:26] of low points, right?
[00:48:27] You're in your freaking truck and you're, you basically try and kill yourself, but luckily
[00:48:33] someone pulled around out of the, pulled around out of the chamber.
[00:48:38] So your, your weapon wasn't chambered.
[00:48:42] Round wasn't chambered.
[00:48:44] Then you get the metal.
[00:48:46] Then you're on like a, there's a little lift, you're getting the metal, you're getting
[00:48:49] all this attention.
[00:48:51] Do you go back down to a low point at some point?
[00:48:55] Yeah.
[00:48:56] Yeah.
[00:48:57] I mean, I mean, I think, like if, yeah.
[00:49:00] I mean, it's, it's always like a, it's like a roller coaster.
[00:49:05] I mean, I don't know what it calls it.
[00:49:07] The end I mean, like there's some days I wake up and I'm just like, me out, I don't even
[00:49:10] get out of bed.
[00:49:11] I don't even get out of bed.
[00:49:13] And why I don't know.
[00:49:15] But yeah, I mean, after I got the metal, I was in the lowest of the lows.
[00:49:19] I mean, it was the lowest of lows.
[00:49:21] I mean, it was just, I would literally, like, I'll never forget this one time, who was actually
[00:49:26] going to my speaking agency.
[00:49:28] Well, you, you talk about the day the, the president called me to come have a beer with
[00:49:32] him.
[00:49:33] Like, I was standing, I can remember, I was standing, speaking to some Marines.
[00:49:39] I won't say where, but I was speaking to some Marines at an event.
[00:49:42] And I, I was hammered.
[00:49:44] Like, it was probably 9, 10 a.m. in the morning.
[00:49:47] And I'm not talking about, like, buzzed.
[00:49:49] I'm talking about, like, Dakota was drunk.
[00:49:52] I would get up in the morning before interviews, like the six, five, six a.m. interviews.
[00:49:57] And I'd be taking shots on the way to the studio.
[00:50:03] And like, I was standing there and I'll never forget, like, whenever they said for me to
[00:50:07] come over and have a drink.
[00:50:10] So the, the girl who used to take care of me, her name is Janette.
[00:50:13] Janette looked at me in, like, her face, like, melted.
[00:50:16] She's like, I hope they don't give you sobriety tests before you go in.
[00:50:20] Like, we have to sober you up.
[00:50:21] She literally started making me pound waters to try to get me sober enough to go into the
[00:50:26] White House.
[00:50:28] And I mean, that was how I lived.
[00:50:29] Like, I just, I couldn't, I could, I hated, I couldn't take it, you know, and I mean,
[00:50:33] I could, but I just, I just hated what it was about.
[00:50:36] It wasn't about the work or about the workload.
[00:50:39] It was just I was literally just living this nightmare.
[00:50:43] And, you know, there were rock stars.
[00:50:46] And, but yeah, I mean, how was this shit, Joe?
[00:50:50] So how long did you stay in that mode for?
[00:50:55] Probably until, like, 2014?
[00:50:57] And then what happened in 2014?
[00:50:59] Did you realize something, what happened?
[00:51:02] I just, I state, like, I kind of, I kind of seen that, like, I need to get my shit together.
[00:51:08] You know, I was going out and I kind of had a turn of, like, I, look, I wasn't going to be
[00:51:16] able to change it.
[00:51:17] Like, I wasn't going to be able, I realized I wasn't going to be able to out drink it.
[00:51:20] And, um, how do I turn into something positive, right?
[00:51:23] And I, I just, I had this dream to be able to, to my ass, me one time, they're like,
[00:51:27] what do you want to do?
[00:51:28] And I'm like, I honestly, I just want to change the world.
[00:51:32] And I know it sounds crazy, right?
[00:51:34] It sounds so crazy.
[00:51:35] But when I, when I looked real deep into, why have I done, like, the stuff I didn't
[00:51:42] have can withstand?
[00:51:45] You know, like, I didn't do it for me.
[00:51:49] I didn't do it.
[00:51:51] The thing I did was ultimately down, of trying to make the world that I was part of,
[00:51:56] just a little bit better.
[00:51:58] Like, like, like, anytime I handed out soccer balls to the kids, or I went out front
[00:52:04] of the gate, you know, I was just trying to make their day a little bit better.
[00:52:08] Show them a different perspective.
[00:52:10] When I was, when I was taking a shot, now I was trying to take a guy out, or I was
[00:52:14] going in and they were asking for help.
[00:52:16] And hey, we need security in this, in this village to help us out the Taliban's doing this,
[00:52:20] so that I literally just wanted to make the world just a little bit better.
[00:52:24] And if, if that's truly my core purpose, why can do that here?
[00:52:31] It's no different.
[00:52:32] Well, one of the things that I've been talking about in a bunch of different ways lately
[00:52:37] is this idea of being caught in, like, an echo chamber and a feedback loop, and you hear
[00:52:41] it in the social media world because if you're a super liberal person, you just see a bunch
[00:52:47] of conservatives stuff, happens in a leadership position because if you're in a leadership position,
[00:52:54] and you have an idea and everyone just is a yes man, then says, yep, yep, yeah, you're
[00:53:00] great boss.
[00:53:01] That sounds like a great idea and you go forward, you're only hearing, you don't get any
[00:53:04] other input.
[00:53:07] And it happens to people's mentalities too, where, you know, they have a bad day, and then
[00:53:13] they think, well, today was so bad and tonight's going to be bad too, and then tomorrow
[00:53:16] was going to be bad, and I don't, they get caught in this echo chamber of reinforcing the
[00:53:24] same thoughts over and over again.
[00:53:27] And that's fine if they're good thoughts, but when it's a negative thought, and just like,
[00:53:31] you know, when you do feedback with a microphone into an amplifier, right?
[00:53:34] It just turns into a freaking squeal and you can't get out of it until you either shut
[00:53:38] that thing off or you get that microphone away.
[00:53:41] So, you know, it sounds like you were in that mode, but then you thought to yourself,
[00:53:48] you know, it's pretty, what you've just said of like realizing, hey, I can't change it,
[00:53:54] why did I do it, what can I do to move forward?
[00:53:57] Like that's a huge step away from, it's, it takes a lot of strength to break out of
[00:54:06] this negative attitude.
[00:54:08] And what sucks is you meet people and they're freaking trapped in there.
[00:54:14] And it's, it's, I don't know, I don't know if you can actually manually, I don't know
[00:54:22] if I can manually go to you and say, hey, you're in an echo chamber right now and get
[00:54:26] you out of it.
[00:54:27] Yeah.
[00:54:28] I think sometimes I think it may be that the person has to do that for themselves.
[00:54:33] Well, I always say like you, you can either like sometimes you find yourself in the middle
[00:54:42] of nowhere and the middle of nowhere and sometimes in the middle of nowhere you find yourself.
[00:54:48] And yeah, I mean, I think what's even more dangerous is when you start drinking your own
[00:54:55] coolly, right?
[00:54:58] Like when you're not looking at everybody else and kind of getting a feeling off of
[00:55:03] it and then you surround yourself with a bunch of yes people like and then you, and then
[00:55:07] you only get that you start drinking your own cool light.
[00:55:10] I mean, what happens?
[00:55:11] Like, yeah, you can live off of in a survival situation drinking your own urine.
[00:55:16] But what happens if you drink it five times over?
[00:55:19] It's dead, your dead.
[00:55:21] And I think that's dangerous.
[00:55:23] Well, actually, it's the same mechanism.
[00:55:25] It's just a different, it's just a one positive, one negative.
[00:55:28] If you go and just positive positive positive positive, you'll spend out and you'll think
[00:55:31] you can't be stopped and you can think you can do nothing wrong.
[00:55:34] If it's negative, negative, negative, you don't think you can do anything right.
[00:55:36] And the reality is for everybody.
[00:55:38] When you're some right, we do some wrong.
[00:55:39] We make some mistakes.
[00:55:40] We have some wins.
[00:55:41] We have some losses.
[00:55:42] We move forward.
[00:55:43] We take a couple steps back.
[00:55:44] We move forward again.
[00:55:45] But people that think, oh, every step I take is going to move me forward and everyone's, you
[00:55:50] know, everyone's following me because I'm awesome or nothing I can do can move me forward.
[00:55:56] It's not, that's not the way life is.
[00:55:57] It's not one or the other.
[00:55:58] It's both.
[00:56:01] And people get stuck there in one or the other.
[00:56:05] I think the negative one is the one that looked a positive one.
[00:56:10] It seems like what happens with the positive one is when you fall off that train, you
[00:56:16] at least you fall onto, you have a little distance to fall and you're going to be okay.
[00:56:20] You have like enough room to pull your reserve.
[00:56:23] When you're at the bottom, you're on reserve and you burn in.
[00:56:28] And that's what I was on, right?
[00:56:29] It was just everything was negative around me.
[00:56:31] The alcohol, I mean, everything was negative, right?
[00:56:34] I mean, I'm waking up literally talking about my teammates death.
[00:56:37] And everything was negative.
[00:56:40] I mean, it was, and I, I just had to pull myself out of it.
[00:56:48] I don't know of one situation that just like boom, smacked me out of it.
[00:56:55] I will say this like ultimately the, one of the biggest changing points in my life was
[00:56:59] when I had my daughter.
[00:57:04] That was, that was whenever the drinking quit.
[00:57:08] Like that was whenever I took it.
[00:57:10] And I said, I said, you know what, it's not about me.
[00:57:18] I know I'm not the best person in the world.
[00:57:21] And you know, I, but I'll tell you this, my daughter didn't choose to come in this world.
[00:57:27] She didn't choose to come in.
[00:57:28] The circumstances that she came in under.
[00:57:32] And it is my obligation to ultimately give her and wake up every day and strive to be
[00:57:38] the father that that young girl deserves.
[00:57:41] And that's it.
[00:57:43] It really is that simple.
[00:57:45] And so that was whenever the drinking just went to a halt.
[00:57:50] But then there was a whole suit problems after that right of now I'm not dealing with my
[00:57:55] anxiety or my issues with drinking now they're coming to light.
[00:58:00] So you know now it was kind of having to face the true reality of this not not not taking
[00:58:05] the band aid.
[00:58:06] I mean drinking is no different than taking.
[00:58:08] It feels, I mean, it's just a, it's just another, it's just another form of it right.
[00:58:13] And so that was a whole other problem.
[00:58:17] But I got to look at that little girl and like that was that is, you know, sailor and
[00:58:25] athlete are by far.
[00:58:28] I need them way more than they could ever need me.
[00:58:31] You know what I mean?
[00:58:33] Like, and they change my life for the better and they still do every day.
[00:58:39] Because ultimately that's what the man that I am, I have to be a good man because I want
[00:58:47] my daughters to find good man and I want them to know what a good man looks like.
[00:58:51] And I want if they start dating shitty guy someday it's probably because I'm a shitty guy.
[00:58:56] I want to set the example to them of hopefully what they strive to go to go find and
[00:59:02] marry someday.
[00:59:04] And I have to wake up and be that.
[00:59:09] That's weird from being in the military.
[00:59:13] The perspective for me because I was a young, unlisted guy.
[00:59:17] I was going to say young dumb.
[00:59:19] And yes, I was a young dumb and that's the guy.
[00:59:22] And the more I moved up in the ranks all of a sudden you're like responsible for people.
[00:59:28] And those was no overnight like transition for me.
[00:59:32] Because I was enlisted and then I became an officer and I was a junior officer.
[00:59:36] But it wasn't like I was an officer now and now I need to or I'm in charge of this training
[00:59:42] event.
[00:59:43] And so I need to know it wasn't like an overnight thing.
[00:59:46] But I realized that hey, all of these guys are counting on me to do my job to make good
[00:59:52] decisions to give them the support that they need.
[00:59:55] That's all on me.
[00:59:56] All on me 100%.
[00:59:57] And so slowly over time, I started acting more and more like a freaking responsible human
[01:00:03] instead of like a complete freaking savage when I was freaking younger to you guys.
[01:00:11] So I just got, you know, I just grew.
[01:00:14] And then obviously, yeah, when I had kids, it's like, oh, now there's people that also
[01:00:19] rely on me 100%.
[01:00:23] For everything.
[01:00:24] For everything.
[01:00:25] And they're looking at me as an example of how they should be acting and what they should
[01:00:30] be looking for.
[01:00:31] Yeah.
[01:00:32] Yeah.
[01:00:33] So you did you stop drinking like, yeah, I mean, cold turkey?
[01:00:38] I did.
[01:00:40] When sailor, when sailor was born, I pretty much, I mean, I pretty much cut it out to
[01:00:47] cold turkey.
[01:00:49] Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, I was like, yeah, I mean, I was, I had to, I mean, I was, I was in a
[01:00:57] custody battle first off.
[01:00:59] So how do the gate?
[01:01:00] I mean, I wasn't even, I mean, I wasn't, yeah, I mean, yeah, I wasn't
[01:01:03] in there when sailor was born.
[01:01:05] And I got to meet her like three months later.
[01:01:08] And so, you know, with the custody battle, it was, look, I'll take 90% of it, my fault.
[01:01:15] Mambras didn't get along.
[01:01:17] She went back to Alaska.
[01:01:19] It didn't work out, right?
[01:01:21] And so I wasn't there for the, the, the birth.
[01:01:25] And so finally, after three months of fighting and all the stuff that people do,
[01:01:33] right, and I look, I'm sure I call as my amount of it.
[01:01:37] So let me say that upfront, I'm definitely not an easy person to live with.
[01:01:42] You know, I finally got to meet her.
[01:01:46] And my out-kniver forget like I flew up, I flew up on an airplane.
[01:01:52] So first off after I seen, realized that sailor was born, I went.
[01:01:55] It was on the, it was on the 23rd, or she was born on the 23rd.
[01:01:59] And so Christmas that year was 20, Christmas Eve was on a Thursday.
[01:02:04] And Christmas is on Friday that year.
[01:02:07] And I went up that Saturday as soon as the store's open back up.
[01:02:11] And I, I went ahead and bought like all of her stuff to have my house.
[01:02:14] I didn't know when I'd get to see her or anything like that.
[01:02:17] If she'd ever even get to come, they can tuck you.
[01:02:19] But like, I was at that.
[01:02:20] So I was going to be a dad.
[01:02:22] And I had no clue about a change of diaper anything.
[01:02:25] And then I went to this month long, it's like an online nanny school.
[01:02:30] And I became a certified nanny and different care specialists.
[01:02:34] So I was like doing these classes.
[01:02:37] I was doing these classes, right?
[01:02:38] Like of how to swaddle, like learning about all these things that kids do, right?
[01:02:45] And I mean, I just never wanted to.
[01:02:47] It wasn't my daughter's fault.
[01:02:48] So like I never wanted to not be what she needed if she needed it.
[01:02:54] And so like I need to spend my mind set was I need to, you know, I'm a dad.
[01:03:00] And I need to try to, if I, even if I'm not with her, I need to be training to do something
[01:03:05] to be able to, to give her the life that she deserves.
[01:03:09] And man, three months into it, I got to major.
[01:03:11] And so I fly up there.
[01:03:13] And what I would do is I would fly to Alaska and we're like, I'm going to put this
[01:03:16] training to the kids.
[01:03:17] Yeah, it says like I had all this stuff like man, like I knew like the five essays of like,
[01:03:23] you know, how to get a child to like, you know, to calm down, like all this stuff.
[01:03:27] I was a master.
[01:03:28] I had this like little baby doll that I used to swaddle practicing, right?
[01:03:32] Yeah, crazy.
[01:03:33] I know.
[01:03:34] I know.
[01:03:35] So I fly up there.
[01:03:40] And so I would fly to Alaska every other weekend.
[01:03:43] And I would raise her for four days out of a hotel room, a three month old.
[01:03:49] And from Kentucky.
[01:03:51] And so I would go up there and I got her man.
[01:03:54] The first time I laid eyes on her, that was it.
[01:03:57] Like I got on the plane coming home after those four days.
[01:04:01] And I just say, hey, I'm getting rid of everything and Kentucky.
[01:04:03] And even if I just have to work at McDonalds, I'm going to Alaska and I'm going to raise
[01:04:06] this kid.
[01:04:09] I don't want anything else.
[01:04:10] I don't want another life.
[01:04:11] I don't want anything else.
[01:04:12] I don't care if I just, if I just have to live in a car park on a side road, I'm going
[01:04:16] to raise this kid.
[01:04:17] And I am going to, I'm going to be the best dad that I can be.
[01:04:21] And that's why I started figuring out right.
[01:04:24] I went home and literally started looking at assets about how to close everything down and
[01:04:28] leave.
[01:04:29] And yeah.
[01:04:31] So that was kind of, that's kind of that.
[01:04:33] And I just go up there.
[01:04:34] And then after that, you know, like a little ways into it, we stopped fighting.
[01:04:37] And remember, it's still decided to get married.
[01:04:40] And we got married and you know, had another kid and then went to shit.
[01:04:47] And all this stuff, you were,
[01:04:51] this is like tabloid material.
[01:04:53] Yeah, all tabloid material too.
[01:04:56] Yeah.
[01:04:57] So you, yeah.
[01:04:58] Like if you look at the tabloids now, like they don't refer to me as a metal of honor
[01:05:03] recipient, they refer to me as Bristol Palin's X.
[01:05:10] So you guys get married, which, you know, you're doing the best you can, you know,
[01:05:16] people do what they're going to do, you're trying to figure things out.
[01:05:19] Yeah, I mean, we tried looking.
[01:05:21] Bristol's not a bad person.
[01:05:22] You know, she's, she's the mother of my children.
[01:05:25] She gave me the most beautiful things in the world.
[01:05:27] Like my kids are healthy.
[01:05:29] They're beautiful.
[01:05:30] They are, they're the best thing that I have.
[01:05:35] And I owe her for that.
[01:05:36] I owe her for for all that.
[01:05:38] You know, I'm not an easy person to live with.
[01:05:41] Like let me tell you, I'm not.
[01:05:45] So yeah, so we got, we got our beautiful kids.
[01:05:47] So where did you move?
[01:05:47] Once you got, once you guys got married.
[01:05:50] So I, we, we got married and I literally packed up two suitcases and left
[01:05:56] for Alaska and I never came home.
[01:05:58] I just moved in with her.
[01:06:00] And I would fly to the States, just as I was on, going to give speeches across
[01:06:05] them, you know, Canada, lived up there for a year and then we moved to Austin.
[01:06:11] And how you doing, like at that point, are you starting to sort of process
[01:06:17] everything that happened or you starting to be like, okay, these people are calling
[01:06:22] me a hero, but I have an opportunity to be able to explain to them my perspective of it.
[01:06:26] When you start to kind of put this together in a way that was more manageable for you.
[01:06:31] No, I mean, it's still not, right?
[01:06:33] Because everybody wants to argue with me.
[01:06:35] You know, it's like, no, no, like understand I'm a failure.
[01:06:39] Oh, no, you did everything.
[01:06:42] You could, like shut up.
[01:06:45] You know what I mean?
[01:06:46] No, it's still that way.
[01:06:47] You know, it's just, no, it's still not.
[01:06:52] It's still not back.
[01:06:54] You know, people still, they hold me in this regard that I'm like, that I'm something, that
[01:07:00] I'm something that I'm not, I'm no different than anybody else.
[01:07:04] You know, as I said to something, you said you, I was listening to your podcast actually.
[01:07:11] When you were saying something along lines of, hey, you know, I, I received the metal of
[01:07:16] honor, but I don't want to let that define me.
[01:07:19] I don't want that to be like the thing that I'm known for.
[01:07:21] And I started thinking to myself, you and me know how freaking completely random war is.
[01:07:27] Like, you don't know what the hell is going to happen.
[01:07:30] There's nothing to wait to predict anything.
[01:07:32] You could have done that deployment.
[01:07:34] That mission could have got scrubbed for 10,000 reasons at night.
[01:07:37] It could have gone in the Taliban could have not been there.
[01:07:40] There's like a million things.
[01:07:41] And so really there's a role of the dice that you were in this situation, the way it
[01:07:47] went down, you didn't get killed.
[01:07:49] You know, it's just, it's so random that if you did hang your hat on that one thing, it's
[01:07:55] like, that's like saying, hey, that's like, that's like, I won the loto.
[01:08:00] Yeah.
[01:08:01] So you should, you know, that means I'm smart or whatever.
[01:08:04] Like, you know, it's, you can't let me pick your numbers for all your body.
[01:08:07] Yeah.
[01:08:08] Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about that.
[01:08:11] Like, you can't let it define you because if you do let it define you, then you're defining
[01:08:16] yourself on the fact, it's like, it's like defining yourself on, you know, how tall you are.
[01:08:20] Yeah.
[01:08:21] It's like, hey, you know, that's just how tall you are.
[01:08:23] There's nothing you could do about that.
[01:08:24] Now look, obviously you took actions that were conscious decision to go doing what you
[01:08:30] had to do.
[01:08:31] But you're right in the fact that if you let that one thing define you, you're hanging
[01:08:37] your hat on something that's kind of random.
[01:08:39] Well, exactly, right?
[01:08:41] But it's also, I mean, it's also like, like, what if, what if like a fighter gets in the ring
[01:08:49] and he gets a win?
[01:08:51] I mean, whether like he got a knockout and it was one hit and it was a whiz.
[01:08:56] I mean, are those hits lucky, right?
[01:08:58] I mean, you know, I mean, like, could you, can you really walk into a ring and say you're
[01:09:03] going to like, and knock people?
[01:09:05] You know what I mean?
[01:09:06] Like, some of that is the same, right?
[01:09:08] Some of it is this guy, just, if you've, if you didn't break this or you know what I mean?
[01:09:13] Like, that's why the games are played, right?
[01:09:15] It's why football teams are not fantasy.
[01:09:18] You know what I mean?
[01:09:19] Like, that's why the game is played.
[01:09:21] And so like for me, it was like, yeah, that day, that day out, like, if it comes down
[01:09:30] to fighting, like, I fought myself.
[01:09:32] I'll say that.
[01:09:36] I fought as hard as I could.
[01:09:40] But that was one day in my life.
[01:09:43] What about the rest of them?
[01:09:45] You know, like, that day's done.
[01:09:46] That's behind me.
[01:09:47] Well, what's next?
[01:09:49] Right?
[01:09:50] Like, I mean, I was in a gunfight four days later that I felt like was worse than that one.
[01:09:55] You know what I mean?
[01:09:56] Obviously I lost my teammates with sucked, but as far as like, I mean, the next one was
[01:10:04] was a harder one for me to pick out than the first one, right?
[01:10:07] And nobody knows about that.
[01:10:09] I mean, I still kept fighting.
[01:10:10] We've gotten a ton of fights after that.
[01:10:13] And so like, you just can't be defined by that.
[01:10:15] You know, your only is good as, as your next step bad.
[01:10:19] And it's like you can't, you can't let your failures define you.
[01:10:24] And you can't let your successes define you.
[01:10:26] Both of them are nothing more than moments in time.
[01:10:30] Yeah.
[01:10:31] That's, that was kind of my, I don't want to call it a setup, but like, it's one thing.
[01:10:38] That's right.
[01:10:39] And even though you feel like, oh, I failed that night.
[01:10:42] So yeah, that was one, that was one thing.
[01:10:44] I did.
[01:10:45] And so to say, you don't want to define yourself by receiving this one award.
[01:10:51] It's also you can't define yourself by the fact that that day you didn't win.
[01:10:56] Exactly, but it still doesn't change the results of the day, right?
[01:11:01] Like, and at the end of the day, those of all taught me valuable lessons.
[01:11:08] You know, you can't, like, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:11:14] hear me out on this, but like life is nothing more than like a, uh, and you're gonna laugh when
[01:11:20] I've defined it.
[01:11:21] When I say this.
[01:11:22] Life is nothing more than for doing.
[01:11:24] You know, like, you know, like an Halloween, they have those rough, good start.
[01:11:29] Okay, scary houses, right?
[01:11:31] Or those those those those whatever those houses that they talked about.
[01:11:34] On the house.
[01:11:35] On the house, right?
[01:11:36] Calm scary houses.
[01:11:37] Whatever.
[01:11:38] So life is like, that's life.
[01:11:42] After you've walked through that heart house once, does it get you again?
[01:11:46] No.
[01:11:47] So that's life, right?
[01:11:48] Like life is full of these things that are not real that scare us because we've never seen
[01:11:55] them or we've never seen them in that place or whatever, right?
[01:11:58] We wouldn't expect them coming there.
[01:12:01] So it kind of shakes us for a second.
[01:12:04] But you got one or two options.
[01:12:06] After you've seen it, you can either, okay, I got it.
[01:12:11] You're there.
[01:12:12] You got me on that one.
[01:12:13] But if I walk through this house again, you don't have me, right?
[01:12:15] And that in that life, like, that's life, right?
[01:12:18] And you know, so like that day, I got the cool parties is like, that's my, that day's
[01:12:25] my kryptonite.
[01:12:26] I'm not going to say that I could never see anything worse because, obviously it could
[01:12:33] always be worse.
[01:12:34] But man, at 21, 21, I got to walk through one of the scariest damn houses that life could
[01:12:43] throw at me.
[01:12:45] I'm going to tell you right now, I got, I got to sit here and look death.
[01:12:48] Right in the eyes, I never thought, I, I never thought I would make it out.
[01:12:55] I got to look at that.
[01:12:56] So I don't have to worry about every day's a bonus day for me.
[01:12:58] I didn't think I was going to live past September 8, 2009.
[01:13:02] I got to sit here and see the very best of human beings.
[01:13:06] I got to see the very worst.
[01:13:08] I got to see what I would do if somebody had a gun to my head.
[01:13:12] I got all these things out of the way in one day that most people go through their whole
[01:13:16] life wondering what they would do.
[01:13:20] You know, I got to know that at 21, what do I have to worry about, going into the next
[01:13:26] house?
[01:13:27] You know what I mean?
[01:13:29] I got my ass beat, all of it.
[01:13:32] You're not going to beat my ass worse than that.
[01:13:37] So I don't have to worry about it.
[01:13:38] You know, the most dangerous guy in the room is the guy that doesn't care to lose.
[01:13:42] I'm not going to tell you.
[01:13:44] I don't care to lose.
[01:13:46] You know, and that's my kryptonite.
[01:13:50] That's like my power or whatever, right?
[01:13:52] That's my, and I'm so fortunate to have gotten that out of the way at 21 years old because
[01:13:59] it's allowed me to go live the life that I've lived, right?
[01:14:02] I get to, I mean, I jump out of airplanes.
[01:14:05] I fly airplanes.
[01:14:07] I fly helicopters.
[01:14:09] I do it.
[01:14:10] And it's like, I get to do it because, and I get to go talk to people about what it's
[01:14:14] like.
[01:14:15] To go tell people, it's all good.
[01:14:18] You can do this, right?
[01:14:19] And so it's kind of a, it's good.
[01:14:21] It's a good thing.
[01:14:25] So where does like, I know a while ago, you know, you had like anxiety.
[01:14:33] Yeah.
[01:14:34] What even is that?
[01:14:35] What does that feel like?
[01:14:36] What happens?
[01:14:38] Where does it come from?
[01:14:39] What do you know about it?
[01:14:41] So I didn't even know, I didn't even know what, I didn't even know a had anxiety.
[01:14:48] I guess like you just kind of get used to feeling this way.
[01:14:52] And I, he got so bad, like after I moved to Alaska when the drinking stopped.
[01:15:00] That, like, I would, I would wake up throwing up.
[01:15:04] I would grind my T-Sohar, like, my teeth on the back are caps.
[01:15:09] And like, I would, I have been here, and I would knock my teeth off with been here.
[01:15:12] Like I'd knock them off by grinding my teeth.
[01:15:15] I'm out of wake up and I'd be throwing up.
[01:15:17] I would be sweating in bed, crying my eyes out.
[01:15:21] Like just can't sit down, can't, like I would try to run it off.
[01:15:24] I can't run it off, can't lay down.
[01:15:25] Like, it just, it was like, what's wrong with me?
[01:15:29] You know what I mean?
[01:15:30] What is wrong?
[01:15:31] I don't even know what's going on.
[01:15:32] And I find out this is this an anxiety attack.
[01:15:39] And you know, I just, I started dealing with it.
[01:15:45] I had a real bad anxiety attack, but I didn't want to go to the hospital because like,
[01:15:51] the VA gave me the option of the VA gave me an option of, I call them up.
[01:15:57] Okay.
[01:15:58] I call them up and I'm like, hey, I need to, I kind of just need to see somebody.
[01:16:02] And they're like, what do you have a case manager?
[01:16:05] I said I don't, like, I live in Alaska, I don't.
[01:16:08] And they're like, okay.
[01:16:10] Now I'm a metal runner recipient.
[01:16:12] I mean, I've got pretty high status in the VA, like as far as the statuses they have, right?
[01:16:19] Like they have these old levels or whatever.
[01:16:20] I imagine.
[01:16:21] So I'm going to be pretty high up there, yeah.
[01:16:23] So like I ask them, I'm like, I just need to see somebody like maybe to give me like
[01:16:27] some blood pressure medicine or something to help me get this, just get through this.
[01:16:30] I just need to get something to get through it.
[01:16:31] I don't want any, like, I'm not asking for Zanxes or whatever, right?
[01:16:37] And they go, well, if you don't have a case manager, then we'll have to get you one of those.
[01:16:40] And then after you get and seen with the case managers, then what we'll do is that case manager
[01:16:44] will get you a doctor and then after you meet with a doctor, then they'll get you to a psychiatrist
[01:16:49] and then you'll be able to get some help for it.
[01:16:51] I said, well, how long is that going to be?
[01:16:54] Probably four to six weeks.
[01:16:57] And I said, I don't have four to six weeks.
[01:17:01] And the woman on the phone, she said, well, you can always come check your in yourself
[01:17:06] into the psych ward.
[01:17:11] And I was like, I don't need that.
[01:17:15] There's no way.
[01:17:17] These are my options.
[01:17:19] And so I called, I called one of my buddies and he knew a doctor and the doctor was like,
[01:17:25] they gave me like some blood pressure medicine that usually some people take for anxiety.
[01:17:29] So I were taking it.
[01:17:30] And then fortunately, they sent me this thing called the alpha stem.
[01:17:35] And it clips on your ears.
[01:17:37] And when they sent it to me, I wouldn't even open it.
[01:17:40] I was so mad that somebody sent this to me because I was like, you really think, this
[01:17:46] is what you think my level of anxiety is.
[01:17:48] You think it's a joke?
[01:17:50] I'm picture in the thing that the time travel machine that Kip puts on his head in the
[01:17:57] Napoleon Dynamite, something like that.
[01:17:59] So finally one day, I'm sitting there and I've got anxiety.
[01:18:04] And it feels like your chest is just like something sitting on your chest.
[01:18:08] Does it come from like, thoughts?
[01:18:10] No, I don't know.
[01:18:12] Is it a physical thing?
[01:18:14] Is it a mental thing?
[01:18:15] It's a physical.
[01:18:16] It's a physical.
[01:18:17] Like you'll feel like you're having a heart attack.
[01:18:21] And you could be watching the freaking cartoons with your kids.
[01:18:24] I'm happy to be just sitting in my truck.
[01:18:26] Sitting in your truck, nothing, just playing.
[01:18:29] And all of a sudden you feel this.
[01:18:30] Yeah, I can feel it coming.
[01:18:32] Is it the same as a panic attack?
[01:18:34] Same thing.
[01:18:36] But do you feel like you're worried about something consciously?
[01:18:39] Or I think it lives in your subconscious?
[01:18:43] You know, like, you can't know.
[01:18:45] I mean, I would be fine.
[01:18:48] And then like it just all of a sudden hits.
[01:18:50] And it's like, it's like, oh gosh, like you can feel it coming.
[01:18:54] And you just, how do I get rid of this?
[01:18:56] And it's, I think it's a subconscious piece, right?
[01:18:58] Like, that's why like it comes out mostly when I'm sleeping.
[01:19:03] Because I can't consciously control what I'm thinking about.
[01:19:06] And when I go to sleep, whatever in your brain needs to come out is coming out.
[01:19:12] Are you dreaming?
[01:19:14] Or you have a nightmare?
[01:19:16] Yeah.
[01:19:17] And the nightmare is like trigger this.
[01:19:19] Usually.
[01:19:22] When the cure for it, because you said the case advisor would send you to a doctor,
[01:19:28] the doctor would send you to a psychiatrist.
[01:19:31] So ultimately, is that what they're looking to do to you is give you some kind of
[01:19:35] psychiatric medicine.
[01:19:37] You know, X-axis, clotipin.
[01:19:40] And these are things that like mellow you out.
[01:19:42] Yeah, or something.
[01:19:44] Allegedly.
[01:19:45] And get you, get you addicted to them.
[01:19:47] Yeah, that was on me.
[01:19:48] Because they're going to numb the pain.
[01:19:50] They're going to numb the thoughts that are causing this stuff.
[01:19:53] Yeah.
[01:19:54] And, yeah, I mean, it's like, you get on that.
[01:19:58] It's a slope, right?
[01:19:59] It's a slope of, you know, why have you started taking that?
[01:20:04] Then, you know, you start getting depressed, right?
[01:20:06] Because I mean, imagine, you know, that was always my problem.
[01:20:09] Like, if I took clotipin or anything like that,
[01:20:11] well, you have a hangover the next day.
[01:20:13] And then I didn't feel like working out.
[01:20:15] So then I don't feel like working out.
[01:20:17] So then it's like, you just, it's like a, it's like this slope of just.
[01:20:20] Right.
[01:20:21] Then, you know, when you, when you get depressed and you start, you know,
[01:20:24] you can't work out.
[01:20:25] You don't feel your normal self.
[01:20:26] Then you're like, why I'm broken.
[01:20:28] And it's just like this downward slope of just.
[01:20:32] It's like, hey, you know what, like, I don't, I'm not scared to look at it.
[01:20:36] I'm not scared to look my demons in the eyes.
[01:20:40] But like when it turns into something like mentally,
[01:20:44] I can deal with it.
[01:20:45] It's when it starts coming out physically.
[01:20:47] Is it starts, is it starts getting you, right?
[01:20:50] So, so back to the earlobe freaking machine.
[01:20:54] So, so that's it.
[01:20:55] So the alpha stem.
[01:20:57] I finally put it on.
[01:20:59] And it would like melted away.
[01:21:02] It would like melted away.
[01:21:05] So you start feeling it, go hook it up.
[01:21:08] I'd hook it up 20 minutes at night before I went to bed.
[01:21:11] That's sleep better.
[01:21:13] Yeah, it was awesome.
[01:21:14] And then, and then I met this person.
[01:21:18] She worked with the guys out at Fort Bragg.
[01:21:23] I met her one and she's like, hey, you need to try this.
[01:21:27] It's called a Stella gangley in block.
[01:21:30] Actually, a seal.
[01:21:31] Sean Mulvaney, Dr. Mulvaney.
[01:21:34] I'm like, come on.
[01:21:37] Everybody's promised me the world with this stuff.
[01:21:40] She's like, go to it.
[01:21:42] SGB.
[01:21:44] And so I fly out.
[01:21:46] I was at rock bottom again.
[01:21:49] Like, it was just frustrating that I can't operate.
[01:21:52] How often are you having these anxiety attacks twice a week?
[01:21:56] And they're freaking crippling.
[01:21:58] I'm talking about throwing up in the floor.
[01:22:00] Like, I'm talking about throwing up in the floor.
[01:22:03] Like, I'm talking about how long are you last for?
[01:22:06] Uh, an hour, 45 minutes.
[01:22:09] And you know, I deal when they're going to hit.
[01:22:11] No.
[01:22:12] And there's no going back to sleep after them.
[01:22:14] Right? Like, there's no.
[01:22:16] Yeah.
[01:22:17] And I'll never forget my daughter looked at me one time.
[01:22:20] We were actually on the road.
[01:22:21] Me and her traveling.
[01:22:23] And so like, I would be scared.
[01:22:25] Like, I never liked the kids to sleep in the bed with me because I never wanted my daughters to see me like that.
[01:22:30] And there were there were a lot of nights that I was sleeping my car in the best by parking lot.
[01:22:36] Probably about three years ago, four years ago, three years ago.
[01:22:40] I was sleeping the best by parking lot because I didn't want anybody to see me see me like that.
[01:22:45] If I felt like I was getting anxiety.
[01:22:47] And you, you still married at this time?
[01:22:50] Yeah.
[01:22:51] And is there any like, how's that going?
[01:22:56] Yeah.
[01:22:57] Just like you guys are trying to figure it out. Yeah.
[01:23:00] It's just what it is.
[01:23:01] She can't. I mean, she doesn't.
[01:23:02] You know, she's, we got three kids and, you know, she's watching me.
[01:23:07] How could you be married to somebody like that?
[01:23:10] How could you be married to somebody who, you know, you look at.
[01:23:13] And like, you don't understand their anxiety.
[01:23:16] So like, you're kind of like, what's wrong with this person?
[01:23:18] You know what I mean? Like, this guy's just this week.
[01:23:20] You know what I mean? It's like, it's not something.
[01:23:22] It's hard to understand, you know?
[01:23:24] And I never forget like me and say they were traveling.
[01:23:28] We were actually at a Marine base.
[01:23:30] And I'd been speaking to a bunch of Marines.
[01:23:32] And she was with me.
[01:23:34] And she was having to sleep in the bed with me at, you know, on the road.
[01:23:38] And I woke up and I was, I was throwing up and I was sitting on a side of bed crying.
[01:23:44] And like, I, I knocked two of my teeth off my, and they came off.
[01:23:49] And like, she, I honestly forgot she was in the bed.
[01:23:53] And, um, man, she got up and like, she like,
[01:23:58] She like, patting me on the back and she said, uh,
[01:24:03] It's okay, daddy. Like, I know you're a good daddy.
[01:24:07] And, uh, man, it was, that was, that was a tough one, right?
[01:24:13] You know, like, it was just, uh, and so I, um,
[01:24:18] Then I was like, I got to do something different.
[01:24:21] You know, like, I was getting the still like angley and blocks quite a bit.
[01:24:24] So you, I cut you off or whatever, but so how was that first one that you and got?
[01:24:29] The needle went in. So I was laying on this hot, this bed.
[01:24:32] So the, the process is that they stick a needle into some part of your neck brain.
[01:24:36] Well, so your neck. So like they do it under ultrasound.
[01:24:39] And like a stick this needle on and, and it like, um, it's a block.
[01:24:44] Um, and it goes on your, it goes on one of your nerves.
[01:24:48] And, um, it's like a reset.
[01:24:51] And, man, as soon as before the needle was even out,
[01:24:54] I remember I was looking at, I was like literally looking at the ceiling.
[01:24:58] And I didn't want anybody to talk because I got, I couldn't believe that,
[01:25:05] that, that I could feel this way.
[01:25:07] Like, there was like the world, the way to the world was off my shoulders.
[01:25:11] Like the anxiety was gone. Like it was, like I didn't know you could feel like that.
[01:25:15] And I was just, the next morning, like I was taking a shower.
[01:25:19] And I was, I caught myself like laughing and singing in the shower.
[01:25:23] And I was like, this is like amazing.
[01:25:26] And, um, so I did that and that worked for a while.
[01:25:30] What's it blocking?
[01:25:31] So I guess what it does is, is you have, you have, um, this is how I was explaining to me was,
[01:25:37] as you have your automated, um, basically like where you automatically do things like breathing.
[01:25:44] Things you don't have to think about, blinking.
[01:25:46] And then you have your, um, where you have to like your manual side of your, your nervous system.
[01:25:53] Right? Like we're okay. I want to pick this cup up.
[01:25:55] I have to think about that and do it.
[01:25:57] So fighter flight is supposed to be, I recognize you as a threat.
[01:26:02] You're a threat now. So I recognize that.
[01:26:05] Now I go into fighter flight.
[01:26:07] And what happens is, is when we've been in that mode for so long,
[01:26:12] your mind just starts to adapt and it puts it over into the automated side.
[01:26:17] And so that's where you get these guys who are automatically back in that fighter flight.
[01:26:24] Um, they automatically go back there because their brain has, has shoved in that system.
[01:26:29] So, so you're kind of like a, imagine with your, your cell phone.
[01:26:34] If it's running wrong or an apps running wrong, what do you do? You reboot it.
[01:26:38] Well, that's what this block does. It doesn't really shut it down,
[01:26:42] but it kind of helps you reboot your system.
[01:26:44] And that's Dr. Muldany was one of the first guys to ever give this for PTSD.
[01:26:49] And what he did was, is he went, he was, I guess he was at this clinic.
[01:26:53] And he was seeing all these symptoms that, uh, pregnant women were having, um,
[01:27:01] when they were, when they were going through pregnancies.
[01:27:04] And they were giving this, I guess it for some piece of it.
[01:27:06] And he's like, well, this is kind of, these symptoms are kind of, let me try it for this.
[01:27:11] And like, it's been huge.
[01:27:14] I'm saved. So, I mean, saving lives like a lot of the guys get it, you know?
[01:27:18] And, um, it helped me for a long time.
[01:27:21] Yeah, I got, I got, I got some people that have been reaching out to me to talk about it.
[01:27:25] Maybe you have some of the experts on here to kind of explain it.
[01:27:28] So more people can understand it. And, uh, and actually when they approached me,
[01:27:33] I said, well, I got a friend that had it. And I actually asked you.
[01:27:36] And I said, did you get that thing? You said you opened as an, how was it?
[01:27:38] You said it's freaking awesome.
[01:27:39] Awesome.
[01:27:40] So that kind of opened my mind up and said, all right, you know,
[01:27:42] for the virus can help spread the word on this, then let's do it.
[01:27:45] Yeah, and, you know, like, all these things are, like, let me say this.
[01:27:48] Like, like, the, the alpha stem, it was, it was great.
[01:27:52] Worked great, right? Uh, the still like, angley and black.
[01:27:54] Like, all these things, they work. Um, it's just a matter of how long they work, right?
[01:27:59] Like, the alpha stem, I'd have to use it pretty much every day, right?
[01:28:02] The still like angley and black. I mean, sometimes I would go six months without getting
[01:28:06] one. Sometimes I'd have to go three months. You know, it just, it's about the longevity of how long they
[01:28:12] worked. You know, and, and honestly, none of it's going to fix it.
[01:28:16] You have to fix it yourself. Like, these are all, I call them, uh, they're kind of like flash
[01:28:22] bangs. Um, they're, they're the flash bangs of life. It's going to, it's, you're going to
[01:28:27] throw that flash bang in there. And it's going to give you some time to get on the
[01:28:30] offense and work there on the defense. Um, right? So you better make you better fix it
[01:28:36] of whatever's causing it. You better get in there and start doing work as soon as as soon as
[01:28:42] as soon as it, as soon as you get it. Right? It's not a, you're not going to sit here and take it
[01:28:46] and, and there, you know, you'd not have to go home and work on your life and work on the way you
[01:28:50] think about things. You know, you got work to do.
[01:28:54] So, we, we, yeah. So what's that work look like? Because when you, I know what I do when I
[01:28:58] throw a flash, flash bang in the room, I know what to do next. I know what that work is.
[01:29:02] What's the work when that you're talking about? I mean, look, some people want to go do some
[01:29:08] counseling, right? Go into talking to people. What I say with people go to counseling, I say,
[01:29:13] uh, I tell people, if you don't have goals, don't go to counseling. Like, don't go into
[01:29:20] counseling and, and think that it's going to be somebody else fixing it for you. Um, it's kind of like
[01:29:25] calling up a trainer and thinking that you, you know, you can go to the best gym, you can have the
[01:29:30] best trainer and the best nutritionist, but you still got to put it in the work, you still got to eat
[01:29:33] the right food, and you still got to show up and do it, right? And, and it's kind of the same thing
[01:29:37] with counselors. Um, know what you want changed. You know, you know, really look at, take a hard
[01:29:43] look in the mirror and, and it starts with accountability and like a lot of people want to
[01:29:48] avoid accountability because as soon as you recognize, as soon as you say and look in the mirror,
[01:29:52] it's like, hey, I'm fat. Well, then you've made a conscious choice not to do something about it.
[01:29:57] And, um, so for me, like, I know that I have to get, like, usually I, I look in the mirror and I
[01:30:04] start seeing who I'm surrounded by. Like, when I start going down that road, the first thing I look at,
[01:30:09] where am I spending my time? Um, and that usually tells me the most of it, right? So I'll back off
[01:30:17] of that and then, um, and then I just start, I start, you know, if I need to go to counselor,
[01:30:23] if I want to talk to people, I'll talk to people. But most time for me, like, I want to talk to
[01:30:28] I'll call you or I'll call, I call people and they don't even know why I'm calling them,
[01:30:33] but I'll call them. I'll call them. We're just to get out. Whenever you're free,
[01:30:39] get me pops up on my phone. I'm like, here we go. I like, do I have an hour? Yes, I do. We're living
[01:30:46] a rocker. Oh, I don't know what I know. I'm like, it's good to be doing. Sometimes I get out the
[01:30:51] phone with you. I was sitting on my front porch talking to you one day. I got a phone, I called you
[01:30:56] for like five minutes and we were on the phone for an hour and I got off the phone and I'm like,
[01:31:00] I promise you, I won't back in. I'm like, I don't even know why this guy answers the phone for me.
[01:31:05] I remember the one time we were talking and when I got off my wife was like, who was that?
[01:31:12] I was like, it was Dakota. She goes, I have never heard you laugh. So freaking hard for so long.
[01:31:20] One time I remember I was in my kitchen and I had tears. Literally tears were coming out of my eyes.
[01:31:26] I was laughing. So freaking hard at what you were telling me and man, and that's happened a few times.
[01:31:33] It's happened a few times. I mean, oh yeah. So yeah, I know when I see that when I see the
[01:31:41] code of pop up on my phone, I'm like, all right. Yeah. I should freaking record those things.
[01:31:46] Yeah, I could record them for counseling. I could record them for podcasts or I could record them
[01:31:50] for comic freaking relief. Yeah, you know, because like you, you, you don't help it though.
[01:31:57] Like let me say this. You, you are like the fuel of it because because I'll say something.
[01:32:04] And you'll say like a few little words just like, you know, like I'll be coming down and he'll just
[01:32:09] like say something else and gauge and it's like, there we go again. Yeah. No, I remember one time you
[01:32:14] called me two and you were like, man, you were ready to go hot. Oh, I was. And I was like, all right,
[01:32:19] man, and actually I remember what I said, I said, okay, let's think about this strategically.
[01:32:24] Let's think about this strategically. Well, if you execute what you're talking about,
[01:32:28] execute me. I said, where are you? You've been six months, where are you going to be three years?
[01:32:36] Where you can be five years like that was pretty much all I had to say. Did you get it? Yeah.
[01:32:41] Oh, oh, yeah, I remember that conversation. Yeah.
[01:32:47] Jock, Jock, Jock told me was and he didn't say not to do it. I understand. He didn't say not to do it.
[01:32:53] He, he, he said, hey, he said, if you're going to do it, um, like only do it if it's worth
[01:33:01] losing everything. That's exactly what he told me. And that's a picture. And then that's what I left with.
[01:33:08] And I was walking around Lowe's and I was like, yeah, I don't think further yet. All right,
[01:33:13] so that's working around. So what is the hard work story? Are you going to do it?
[01:33:17] We're not talking about that. We're not talking about that, but we will say it was not legal.
[01:33:24] No way. It was no way. When I had already thought it, you had a freaking course of action
[01:33:28] before me. It was called the freaking battlefield command. He was like, hey, boss, I got a
[01:33:32] course of action. I want to run by you. See if I can get mission execute on this thing. I'm like,
[01:33:36] okay, go ahead. You know, I'm all ears. What you got? Seven minutes later, you know, he's running through
[01:33:41] time line. Oh, that's a cute check list. I'm like, okay, I already had the cover up story.
[01:33:47] Right. Yeah. Man. But like that to me is like that. Like, but as you know what, like, but I know who
[01:33:59] to call, right? Like, I know in that situation, I'm not going to call some idiot. You know what,
[01:34:05] I mean, because next thing you know, they're like, we're going to meet you. We're doing right?
[01:34:11] I know, I know, like, I'm so fortunate. I got, I've got all, like, I've got quite a few, just people
[01:34:17] that I just look up to so much. And I trust. I trust like, like, you like, if you tell me something,
[01:34:23] like, I know, I know it's what you would do. And so I trust that, right? Like, I know it's exactly
[01:34:29] what you believe in what you would do. And so like, that's why I would call you with something like that.
[01:34:35] Or I would call you. And that's for me, that's that's my, that's how I fix myself.
[01:34:41] You're, I mean, yeah, no, it's, it's, it's, uh, believe it or not, if you have people around you,
[01:34:48] that can, are, are on the same wavelength as you, it's a method of actually detaching from the
[01:34:53] situation, because you're all wrapped up in it, right? You're with the emotions and all this stuff.
[01:34:57] You're all wrapped up up. And I'm not just saying you, but any human echo could be all wrapped up
[01:35:01] on some emotional thing and call me up and be like, hey, this is what's going on. This is what I want to do.
[01:35:06] Because we're bros, I, I'm thinking in your best interest. I'm thinking in your best interest.
[01:35:11] So I'm, but I'm not wrapped up in it. So I can say, hey, man, let's think through what you want to do
[01:35:16] right now. Let's see what the long term. I mean, and that why, like, in fights, I mean, their coaches are in
[01:35:22] the coaches are there. The coaches in the corner, right? Like, the coaches and out there necessarily,
[01:35:28] you know, engaging or necessarily having to put in the physical piece of it, but the coaches make
[01:35:33] sure that guy doesn't get too emotional, making sure to, to stay stick to the plan exactly.
[01:35:38] And, and that's why it's so important in life, you know, like even back when all this media stuff
[01:35:45] used to go on, and I would get hammered. Like, I have a few people who are very, the one at some
[01:35:52] of the best in the media world. And I'll back up and call them. And you know what I make a rule.
[01:35:58] I make a rule that as soon as I pick up the phone, like, I'm not calling you for advice.
[01:36:02] Like, when I call you about that, like, if you say don't, don't do this or, or, hey, do this,
[01:36:08] why listen to that? Because I picked up the phone and I called and asked it, like, I'm not
[01:36:12] going to sit here and ask you and then go do something stupid because like, why would I even waste
[01:36:17] your time? You know, and, and that's, I think that's so important to have those people in your life,
[01:36:24] to be that logic side when you get into the emotional side too much. You know, for sure.
[01:36:29] All right. So we're getting the the Stelet gangly and block and that's sort of
[01:36:36] giving you the opportunity to work some of these things out. You know, the weird thing is
[01:36:42] that's thinking about. So one of the things that I know for a fact, right? So, you know,
[01:36:48] for me, I'll go and talk to a company or I'll go and talk to people or I'll talk on this podcast
[01:36:54] about the worst days of my life, right, when I lost guys and it's, I believe it's helpful
[01:37:04] because I've like, okay, I've talked about, I've written this down, I've explained what this
[01:37:08] situation is, even even, you know, giving like, ulegies for my friends at their, at their
[01:37:19] memorial services, like you have to kind of think through things and you have to process them and
[01:37:23] then you write down and then you like even that for me, it's socks and it's freaking horrible,
[01:37:30] but at the same time, I know that it allows me to sort of gather together my thoughts and put them
[01:37:36] in some kind of perspective. And when you write something down, you're actually attaching from it.
[01:37:40] You're actually attaching from it. You're, you're, it's on the paper. It's, it's actually on the paper.
[01:37:46] And then when you talk to some people about it, it's like, oh, you get to see their perspective,
[01:37:50] they get to give you some of their perspective about it. And so it's a way of, um, um,
[01:37:58] I guess just working through the problem, like it's like almost like stretching your when you're
[01:38:02] sore, you know, you stretch out, right? It's almost like that. Hey, I'm going to get some blood back
[01:38:06] in there. I'm going to think through this and the difference for you, like in those early days,
[01:38:12] people are just putting their perspective on you. It's like just layering it on you all the time.
[01:38:18] Yeah, and like let me ask you, yeah. So like when you, like what, how old, like where were you
[01:38:24] at in your life? Like when you lost your guys? 30, five. Okay. Were you married? Yes. Okay. So like
[01:38:35] so like check. So like how old are you right now? I'm 32. Yeah. So so my, my thing is is right is like
[01:38:43] what, what would have happened if you know, you, you, you, you, you had that it happened 10 years before.
[01:38:54] For sure. You know, you know what I mean? So like I think that's what's, I think that's where you,
[01:38:58] like that, that's, that's, that's what's awesome about is like you're kind of like,
[01:39:04] for just for me. I'll talk about for me. Like you're the, you're, you're the, I can, like you're the,
[01:39:14] you're the better side of this. Like I can, like you, you give hope to a guy like me.
[01:39:20] They, man, I can get there. I can, I can, I can, I can be okay. Like this ain't this ain't like the
[01:39:25] realities that are in my mind sometimes. Like I understand, like I can look at somebody and say,
[01:39:30] look, no, no, this isn't realities. Like I'm not, I, I will figure this out. If I, if I, if I hang around
[01:39:35] people, if I hang around jocco and I take that and I take that mentorship, I can be that someday.
[01:39:41] I can get there someday. I can literally look at it. It's not an idea. Your reality. And for a guy like
[01:39:47] me, that's reality. And I think that's, but, but on the back side of it, you're not giving me,
[01:39:53] you're not giving me advice. The guys, if I talk to my buddies, like I'm taking advice from a guy who
[01:39:59] seen it at at 23 21 myself, right? You got to see it from a perspective at an older age with a different
[01:40:08] life. 100% my whole, in fact, my whole experience of like being in combat was the most,
[01:40:17] the most gentle, like rot, like the first operations I did were like, no, that was like nothing.
[01:40:22] Like cool, we're going outside the while. It was like this really nice, kind of ramp, slow ramp.
[01:40:26] It wasn't just like, oh, welcome to combat. You know, everything's freaking crazy. So I,
[01:40:31] you know, even like the, the just the nervousness about of being like, oh, this is real. Like,
[01:40:38] that was, I was very lucky. Yeah. I got that out of my system. The first five
[01:40:42] ops I went on, and nothing happened, right? I was like, oh, okay, cool, I kind of got this, right?
[01:40:46] And then it, it was just a slow kind of ramp from there. And, and yes, I was old.
[01:40:52] I mean, I can't believe I was three years older than you are, right, freaking now.
[01:40:56] I'm, let's, but crazy. And I'd spent my whole life in the military.
[01:41:01] And that's what, you know, so the, yeah, I was a huge, I was very, very lucky in the way things unfolded
[01:41:07] from it. And, and when things, if they got, when they got, not good for you,
[01:41:14] you had a person in your life that you trusted with everything.
[01:41:17] That you knew if you were starting to get off the path, you knew you could look at her and
[01:41:23] you could have a good gauge. You had a, you had a very good gauge of the man that you were.
[01:41:30] Yeah, and I think more than that, um, in my own mind, I realized that I needed to.
[01:41:37] And I, I'll tell you what I talked about this with J.P. when J.P. was on here. And, um,
[01:41:40] and so when, when Mikey got killed, we were sending him home. And he was, so we're going into
[01:41:50] like a connex box to like say goodbye to him one at a time. And like I walk, so basically you can walk
[01:41:58] in the connex box. You see, Mike, you know, freaking give him a kiss and say goodbye. And then turn around
[01:42:06] and walk back out. And, um, I remember just looking at J.P. and because J.P. was like right ahead of me
[01:42:16] walking in and as he's walking back out, like I, I see J.P. and J.P. was 22 or 23 years old.
[01:42:25] And this was his bro. And I look at his face and he is just fucking just absolute torment in his face.
[01:42:33] And I said to myself like, hey, J.P. you better keep your shit together right now. Because
[01:42:40] like you said earlier, like it's like a breaking point. And people, if one person breaks it's,
[01:42:44] and on the guy that's allegedly in charge. And if I break down right now, man,
[01:42:50] it's going to be what it's going to be a nightmare. And I remember seeing him be turned around. He
[01:42:54] looked at me in the eyes and his face was just tormented and, and J.P. is such a passionate guy. And he's
[01:42:59] so emotional and, and he was young, you know. And I just remember, I said, I better,
[01:43:05] you gotta keep your shit together right now. Because they, because, you know, they need you.
[01:43:12] Right, they need you to act like a fucking man right now. And that's what I had to do. And I kind of
[01:43:19] felt like, you know, with with my wife, with my family, it's the same type of thing. Like,
[01:43:23] hey, you got a hold the line. Like, you got to, you got to do this. And look, my wife's
[01:43:27] a freaking badass. You know, she's the one that was, you know, I think, I didn't go to Mikey's funeral.
[01:43:33] I was still in Iraq. I didn't go to Mark's funeral. I was still in Iraq. Like, this is,
[01:43:37] this is, this is my wife going to those things, you know. So, and she's, by the way, she's got three
[01:43:43] kids. You know, she's getting a baby sitter so she can go to my friends' funerals. So, I'm not trying
[01:43:48] to sit here and say, like, oh, I had to be all, all strong. She had to be strong. But that's what,
[01:43:54] um, I guess to your point, I was older. I had a little bit more life experience, um, and, you know,
[01:44:05] as you get older, you're, you're more able to handle things and put them in perspective.
[01:44:10] Yeah, I mean, at, so like, at 33, that would be 12 years older than what I was when it happened to me.
[01:44:20] You know, and I'm, by no means, I'm not, I'm not saying that it's either way or the other. I'm
[01:44:26] just saying that like, the world's a little bit different than, right? And, and, and, you know,
[01:44:32] like, the maturity levels of how I handled a lot of it is not the right way. You know what I mean? Like,
[01:44:38] was drinking and, and going out and, and, you know, punching people in the face, like, you know,
[01:44:43] and in the new book, we, we have coming out, right? Like, I talk about like, you know, I've just,
[01:44:47] I mean, I was evil. Like, I don't want to tell you, like, I came back and,
[01:44:53] I mean, I was mean. How was mean? And the problem was is like, when you take mean and you take a
[01:45:01] guy who doesn't care and a guy who felt like he's already lost everything, like that is a dangerous
[01:45:06] dude. Like, I would, it was nasty. I would say stuff. Like, I hurt my family. I mean, I would say
[01:45:12] do stuff and it's just, you know, and, and I'm not saying like, I just didn't handle it right.
[01:45:19] And I didn't have anybody there to, to hold the line with me. You know, like,
[01:45:25] I mean, everybody, I, I mean, my whole team was gone. Like, everybody, like, my, the leaders
[01:45:30] on my team were gone. And, um, yeah, I mean, you know, do I regret it? I regret it a ton of it.
[01:45:38] And maybe if I had dealt with it better and maybe I had, you know, you just never know, right?
[01:45:42] And, um, but yeah, it's just, it's different. It's different.
[01:45:47] This is bringing me back to something you were talking about earlier. And I just want to,
[01:45:52] so you're talking earlier about like having a mentor and having people. And I, I just want to say,
[01:45:58] like, you know, if you're in a position where you can help somebody out, that maybe you've
[01:46:03] already been through the haunted house and you can give them a heads up. And I think people when
[01:46:08] they hear being a mentor, it's isn't like this has to be some official thing. Like, hello,
[01:46:13] Dakota, okay. What do you like me to mentor you? Is this not what I'm talking about?
[01:46:17] But just being being someone that can indirectly say, hey, man, how's it going? Okay,
[01:46:24] what are you doing with that? Hey, what are you, what are you thinking is going to happen next?
[01:46:28] Just those kind of comments to be a mentor. You don't have to sign up and you don't have to,
[01:46:32] you don't have to freaking go through a course. You know, there's no eight week, what,
[01:46:37] what, what, what, what was your baby care course code? There's no course for how to handle a 22 year
[01:46:42] old or whatever. It doesn't exist. But just giving sharing your experience and the, the other
[01:46:47] thing is you don't have to be perfect. I'm damn far from, I'm not even, I'm not even the same ballpark.
[01:46:53] Right? You don't have to be perfect to be able to say, hey, listen, Dakota, when this happened to me,
[01:46:59] here's what I did. Here's the actual mistakes that I made. Yeah. Right? The, the,
[01:47:03] the, here's the things that I freaking completely screwed up, watch out for these things. So it's not
[01:47:08] hey Dakota, here's what I'm doing and I was perfect. No, not even close. So maybe you might be
[01:47:15] thinking, listen, this like, well, oh, uh, uh, you know, I'm not good enough to be someone's mentor,
[01:47:21] bullshit or maybe you think I don't want to be someone's mentor, bullshit. Be someone's friend
[01:47:27] build a relationship with them and show them the freaking path through the haunted house, tell them
[01:47:31] what they can expect. Even if you screwed it up, it's better than it's better than not than letting them
[01:47:36] just, you know, get, get in a bad situation, but don't try to mentor them on something you have
[01:47:42] not gone through. Don't say it up front. That's got to be your disclosure. Yeah. Of, you know,
[01:47:50] and, and like, I'm so fortunate because like, man, I'm, I'm surrounded by people I don't deserve.
[01:47:57] Like, I've got, I, I, I, I mean, I, I'm just so fortunate to have just great people. I can pick up
[01:48:02] the phone and call it, hey, what do you think about this, right? And, you know, I tell you the
[01:48:07] one thing that I cut out when, whenever I start going, you know, when I tell you, I have to do
[01:48:11] that self reflection and look around. The people who are feeding into my bullshit are the people
[01:48:16] that have to go. Like, the people who hype me up on my bullshit, like when I call up and I'm like,
[01:48:21] who, yeah, what do you think about this? Oh, you know, like, not that bullshit or whatever,
[01:48:25] right? Like, that's the first people that have to go. I don't, I don't need a cheerleading squad.
[01:48:31] You know, I, I need people who are going to look at me like Tim Kennedy. Like, Tim Kennedy
[01:48:35] looking at me and saying like, you know, I, I, I, I, I, I'm there forget one of the, we were working
[01:48:39] out one time. And, um, I said something, he could tell us down. I was, you know, I was going through
[01:48:44] my divorce and stuff. And I, I looked at him and I said, man, I'd made like a offhand
[01:48:48] comment like, gosh, I'm, I'm fat. And he, like, Tim stopped what he was doing and he looked at me and
[01:48:53] he said, hey, check it out. He said, you, when people hear your name, they look at you as a warrior.
[01:49:00] When you walk on stage, they expect a warrior. When you talk, they expect a warrior. When you
[01:49:05] wake up in the morning, they expect a warrior. So you know what you need to do? You need to look
[01:49:08] in the mirror and he started acting like one. And that was it. Turn around went back to work out, right?
[01:49:13] But that's what I need, right? Like, was that like a kick to me? 100%. But like, I don't need people
[01:49:20] to, to feed in to, to my bullshit. I need people who are going to hold me accountable to standards
[01:49:25] that I can't even hold myself to, to, to know what I can be and hold me to that standard. No,
[01:49:31] hold the line when I don't even see it myself. Yeah, no doubt. And Tim Kennedy is one of those
[01:49:39] common at you. Coming at your life. When he calls me, it's always going to, like, he calls
[01:49:46] me for like reasons. He's like, hey, this is what's going on. He's like ready to brief me. It's
[01:49:50] freaking legit. He's like, hey, here's what's going on. I got this this next time. Hey, Roger that.
[01:49:54] Well, let me think about this. Okay, here's a move. You know, or whatever, here's a deal. Like,
[01:49:59] like, if I call Tim Kennedy up and I said, hey, man, like if he thought I was filling
[01:50:04] so far for myself, I was like, hey, man, I think I'm just going to end it today. Like, I honestly
[01:50:08] think that Tim would be like, oh, I just make sure you leave all your cool, like, how can I have your
[01:50:11] two guns? Like, he's not going to play the sip. Like, if I needed something to know, like, the
[01:50:18] dude would be like, like, hey, I killed this guy. All right, well, well, I'll bring the shovel.
[01:50:23] You know what I mean? Like, but I know these guys are like that. Yeah. And that's where I'm so
[01:50:28] fortunate because I got that circle, right? Like, that circle is everything. Yeah. And I guess
[01:50:33] what I'm saying is that's awesome. And everybody that's listening, you can actually be part of
[01:50:39] that circle for somebody else. 100%. 100%. And if you do that, man, you, you, you make such a huge
[01:50:46] impact in people's lives by doing that. So how long was this stellar gangly and block like of
[01:50:55] the deal? Are you still getting that? I don't like, I, um, I probably did it up until 2020.
[01:51:04] Um, and then my buddy, um, I was struggling real bad. Like, I was, it just, well, I don't know.
[01:51:16] I was just still, I was still struggling with it, right? And, um, he's like, you got to get
[01:51:22] you're going to Mexico. And I was like, for what? He said, don't worry about it. You're going to Mexico.
[01:51:30] I, he said quite a few veterans are going down there. Guys, I trusted he named off a few people that
[01:51:38] I trusted had gone to this. And I said, all right. And so I booked a trip and flew into San Diego. And so
[01:51:47] I was going down to do, uh, it's a therapy, uh, with I will gain and five in me, ODMT and
[01:51:56] then something that I would defer this thing that I could, you could ever get me to be around.
[01:52:05] I was like, this is complete bullshit. And honestly, I was going to go and I told the doctor
[01:52:12] when I got there, I said, hey, I'm coming to this. Just so I can walk away from this and tell
[01:52:17] people that this is all this all bullshit. And I told him that I said, as soon as this doesn't
[01:52:22] work, I'm going to go on every podcast. And I'm going to tell everybody that this is all dissolved.
[01:52:28] So what, what were you going for? What was it? It's called Ibo gain. Okay. And it comes from a
[01:52:34] root. What was the other thing that you said? Five in me, O, it comes from a toad, DMT.
[01:52:39] So this is when Mike Tyson and and Joe Rogan are talking about riding the toad. This is what they're
[01:52:44] talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I went down there and I was in a
[01:52:51] bad. Like I was still like my anxiety just you know, and for me, like the only thing that I like
[01:52:57] when I look back at it, whatever, what would always got me to the point of where I'm like, I don't
[01:53:03] know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow was anxiety. For like the best way to describe it for you is
[01:53:09] imagine when you're underwater and you can't breathe, you should know very well. Do.
[01:53:14] What will you do to get to the top to get a breath and whatever it takes? Yeah. Right. And that's
[01:53:21] what anxiety is. Like if you can't get rid of it, you'll get to the point to where you're like,
[01:53:28] if I have to end it, for anxiety to get rid of this feeling, I will do that. And that was the
[01:53:35] point. That was the only thing that got me there. And so I went down there, the other guy I'm talking
[01:53:43] about when I went to his name, but he was struggling to and let me tell you something. He's one of the
[01:53:46] hardest dudes I know. My team leader, you know, and this was about a year after my team leader,
[01:53:52] who was a Marine sniper took me through, got me to become a Marine sniper, went down a rack with
[01:53:57] him deployed with him, then he went over it, got out of the Marine Corps and said, forget it,
[01:54:01] I'm going to go be a Navy seal, became a Navy seal, deployed with the Navy seals, team out in
[01:54:07] Hawaii and in one day you said, I'm done and put it, put it, put it to gun to his mouth and kill
[01:54:14] himself. Another hard guy, no. And so, you know, when people call these guys cowards,
[01:54:25] they're not cowards. They're not cowards. These are some of the hardest man that have ever
[01:54:33] walked the face to planet. And that's why you know, you have to take it serious. And so anyway,
[01:54:39] this guy, he went down there, I get down there and you have to sign like paperwork that says,
[01:54:47] you may experience that you're dying. I mean, it's one of the scariest things that I've ever done.
[01:54:53] And after you take it, there's no, you ride it to the law frame. There's no off-rim.
[01:54:59] And so I took this out, so you go there and there's like, you didn't eat all day on a Friday.
[01:55:06] I took the Ibogaine at 8 p.m. on a Friday. And now you're talking about, they were like doing
[01:55:13] this sage stuff, like hippie stuff. And I'm like, you guys are hippies. I don't, I don't mean that.
[01:55:18] Like, I'm nothing against hippies, but I'm just not one, right? I don't know, I can't get into this,
[01:55:23] you know, waving this stuff around or whatever. And believe whatever you want again, but like,
[01:55:30] I couldn't, I couldn't get into the mood. And so I'm like, I take it and you have to write down
[01:55:37] your intentions on this piece of paper. And I just wrote that I just wanted to some relief.
[01:55:46] I wanted some, I just wanted some relief, whatever. So you go up and you lay down this room,
[01:55:54] you lay on this, the bed, it's beds on the floor. And you put these blindfolds over.
[01:56:00] And I didn't feel anything for a minute. When you take it, what is that like a drink?
[01:56:04] It's like, like, peel, measure it out, so you take it, you know, in, you and I talked a little bit
[01:56:12] before you came out here. And I knew about some of these things that you were trying. And I don't
[01:56:18] know about these things. Yeah. And one of my friends, Tim Ferriss, is like, just to say, like,
[01:56:25] when you're like, oh, this hippie stuff, that's kind of the way I think, too, right? And, and
[01:56:33] I like want to understand it better because I know it helped you. Look, even, even Rogan.
[01:56:39] He told me he's like, I think it will help. I think it will help Dakota. And you and I went back and
[01:56:45] forth. I was like, hey, man, I'm going to ask Joe. And I said, hey, Joe, what do you think? And at that point,
[01:56:50] he'd met you and he'd been on his podcast. And he was like, that was actually, you actually texted me.
[01:56:58] I did it. You were like, hey, what, this is what I'm coming to San Diego for. What do you think?
[01:57:02] And I was like, dude, I don't freaking know. Let me ask Rogan. So I asked him. And of course,
[01:57:07] what is he's. But he wasn't. I mean, as much as Rogan is is understands this stuff. And he's for it.
[01:57:14] He was also like, he laid out reasons. Yeah, I'll text him and ask him a question about something.
[01:57:19] And he'll be like, no, don't know. That is not going to help. If you're trying for this,
[01:57:24] he's like, nope, that won't help you. So, so that's one part of it. Like, Rogan has that level of
[01:57:29] understanding. And then on the other side, Tim Ferriss is trying to get this stuff approved medically
[01:57:37] and trying to get support there. And so I just asked him to give me a rundown of like, hey,
[01:57:41] what is all this stuff? You know, it's not just hippie stuff. And he's like, no, it's not just hippie stuff.
[01:57:47] And here's what it is. And like, he said, I began because he, he was kind of talking me through this.
[01:57:51] I began from some shrub in Africa. And he said, it's like the most powerful. There is.
[01:57:58] Right. He said a lot of seals do it because seals are like, you know, all right, what I'm going hard.
[01:58:04] Yeah. What do you got? And so, so that's what I became is. I began is it's a lot of times
[01:58:12] they use it for opioid addiction. So yeah, but like, it's so it's so hardcore that they put these
[01:58:19] people on it for opioid addiction. And it kicks their ass to where they don't do opioids again.
[01:58:24] All right. So back to your story. So you take the thing, they're waving, they're waving hippies stuff for
[01:58:33] around. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I just, I couldn't, and I like, they laughed at me the
[01:58:40] whole time, right? They're like, I'm like, yeah, whatever. I can't get it. Are these Americans that are
[01:58:45] down there? Are they? So there was like, yeah, all of them were except for two. Okay.
[01:58:50] And so we're there in this house. And then there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of seals there.
[01:58:59] I like that are, make sure we, nothing, nobody comes in that are there to help you.
[01:59:09] If you need something, but like, all I'm going to tell you, all I'm going to say is,
[01:59:12] is like, I was surrounded by seals. And so that tells me, like, hey, like seals are no bullshit.
[01:59:19] Like, you know what I mean? Like, and that's, yeah. So I took it and all the sudden, like,
[01:59:28] I feel it starting to come. Like, it's like, it was like this spinning. And, and you were just like,
[01:59:38] it was like, it was like, all, it's like I was watching my life on a TV screen. And I didn't see anything
[01:59:44] from more. And I was walking through this town and everything looked gloomy. And I, I, I, I, I
[01:59:53] never forget I went into this one room. And I went in this room. And I, I, I seen like all these
[01:59:58] people, like, this huge crowd. And, but I felt like just disappointment. And, um, and I got,
[02:00:10] I did my typical me of wanting to fix it. Like, what did I do wrong? Like, how can I fix this?
[02:00:14] And I kept running up to all of them. And then it would be like flashing up people that I knew
[02:00:21] and people that like, I knew I hadn't done anything to, but just did it for manipulation.
[02:00:30] And like, there were just flashing on and on. And finally, I'm just like, what did I do wrong? And,
[02:00:35] like, I just remember feeling this like this feeling of just defeat. And I was in there
[02:00:40] for probably four hours. And then I came out and I was walking down the town. Like, I would look
[02:00:45] at every little gauge. And it would be like, uh, the gauge would instead, like it would fill up.
[02:00:51] And instead of being at full, it would say finished. And it would be like this far from finished.
[02:00:56] And I never finished anything. And then I would see this beautiful ball light. And I would go to it.
[02:01:00] And it would be my two daughters playing. And, um, this went on until three p.m. on Saturday
[02:01:09] afternoon. And I never forget there was at one point of it. And I, uh, like, I was just, like,
[02:01:21] I just felt like I was such a trash that I was falling just like, I just, I don't care anymore.
[02:01:30] Like, my ego, it took my ego and just smashed it. And it's like, I don't care when anybody thinks,
[02:01:36] I don't care. I know I wake up and I, I'm the best man. I know I get my best. I'm not perfect. I know
[02:01:44] that I know that I don't come off and say the right things. But I know what my antenna is.
[02:01:50] I know there's, you couldn't look at me and make me question my intent. Like, you can definitely
[02:01:55] question my delivery. You can criticize how I come off or how I do this or, but my intent is there.
[02:02:02] And my intent is good. And I'm never forget like that, it broke everything. It's like,
[02:02:08] got to the point where I got in care anymore. And like, I'm never forget that I was laying there. And I was like,
[02:02:13] just, I'd like, if this is odd, I, this is odd, I. And, um, I just didn't care anymore. I didn't care
[02:02:21] what my mom thought of me. I didn't care what, you know, all these people that I had, I had invested in.
[02:02:27] And I had gave them these titles, which when you give somebody titles, you give them a thought,
[02:02:32] you know, you're not going to tell me what my intent is. And so I come out of it. I was so pissed off.
[02:02:44] When I came out of it, like I literally looked at the doctor and I said, this is what you brought me here for.
[02:02:50] I said, I called up the guy who sent me there who's a close friend. I said, this is
[02:02:56] 100% bullshit. Like I was so down, like out, because my biggest fear was opening Pandora's box.
[02:03:02] And, um, he's like, wait till the next day. So the next day you do this, this five
[02:03:08] MEODMT. And, um, I never forget like, I, I, I, I, I wanted to make sure I seen the world the same. So I'm
[02:03:14] looking out this window in Mexico. And we're looking out. We're right by the ocean. I look out.
[02:03:18] And all I can see is it's not all I can think of my head is man. This place is a shittle.
[02:03:22] That's all I can think. I go down to do this DMT and I, I laid down and as soon as you go, like,
[02:03:29] it's almost like it, it was like feet first. Like I was like gone, like to a tube, right?
[02:03:36] And, um, and it feels real. Or do you know that you're like, no, you know you're tripping.
[02:03:42] You don't see a thing. No, you, you know, I mean, you know, it's, it's not like it's a physical thing.
[02:03:47] Like when you drink you physically feel drunk. It's like your salt. Like it's, it's not a,
[02:03:53] it's not a physical reaction. It's like your soul. And, um, I was, it was gone. And like,
[02:04:01] you can't see anything. It was pure white. It was the most beautiful white
[02:04:04] that I've ever seen in my life. It was, there's no, there's no word in English dictionary to
[02:04:10] ever describe how beautiful the white was. And all I could feel was love. Like I felt good.
[02:04:17] I felt like you could feel what good is. Like if you took how I feel when my daughters
[02:04:22] give me a hug or that that unconditional love, like that's what the whole place felt like.
[02:04:28] It was like the perfect temperature. I didn't think about anything else.
[02:04:37] And all I heard were my teammates say that it was all right.
[02:04:40] And, um, yeah, it was like, it was like everything bad was gone. It was like, I got
[02:04:51] to like a reset in my life. And, uh, when I came back to, I set up. And I just like, I started crying.
[02:04:59] And I looked at these, these two women who were there, these two nurses. And I just couldn't
[02:05:04] believe that like there were such, there were like, I had to like, I'm in Mexico and there's
[02:05:11] two people who genuinely care about me. And, uh, I care about me enough to, to help me through this.
[02:05:20] And I looked out the window and I was like, gosh, this is the most beautiful place I've ever
[02:05:23] been. And I didn't have any anxiety after that. I went back home. The stuff that like would send
[02:05:33] me over the edge. Man, I was just happy to be alive. How long has this, I woke up every, like I
[02:05:40] still, I mean, still, I get up. And do I have bad days? Yeah, but, but like, I'm just happy to be here.
[02:05:53] You know, like, like, you know, I, I just changed my whole life. Like, I, I came back in my anxiety
[02:06:03] was, I mean, I get normal. There is normal anxiety. But like that, those anxiety tax, I haven't had
[02:06:12] one sense. How long has it been? It'll be two years this November.
[02:06:24] You know, the thing that you said about intent is something that I, I, I talk about a lot from a,
[02:06:30] from a leadership perspective and that bleed over into life because I think if you're doing the
[02:06:36] right things for the right reasons, if your intent is good, you're going to be okay. Right? If you're
[02:06:43] not trying to screw somebody over for not trying to maneuver, for not trying to sneak one by somebody,
[02:06:48] if you're not trying to look out for your own agenda, like the military, it's a classic example.
[02:06:52] You get an officer or a senior enlisted leader that what their intent is to get themselves promoted,
[02:06:57] or what their intent is to get themselves at freaking a war or credit or accolades. If that's what
[02:07:03] their intent is, everybody can see it. And it doesn't work out good for them in the end.
[02:07:09] If their intent is good, that they want to get the mission done that they want to take care of
[02:07:12] their team, that they want to, that they're putting themselves below their team and lifting their
[02:07:16] team up. Like, that intent is what, what makes a good leader, what makes a good person.
[02:07:22] And I think when people have bad intent, it eats them apart, it eats them up.
[02:07:28] And they can, they can have bad intent. You can cover it up. You can try and drown it out. You can
[02:07:32] pretend that it's not there, but it's there. And what I tell people is like intent, you can smell
[02:07:37] people's intent. And the worst part about it is you can smell your own intent. You can. And if you have
[02:07:43] bad intent, you have to sit in that rod and stink yourself. And it will, you apart. You can put
[02:07:50] a perfume all over it. You can put the odor in all over it. It's still there. And you know it.
[02:07:56] So that's like a realization that you had of my intent is good. Yeah, like, like, look,
[02:08:07] your intent is, is your foundation of your house. Your priorities are basically the, the shell
[02:08:17] of your house. They can change. You can move rooms. You can adjust on it. Right. But if you're intent,
[02:08:29] you know, if your intent is is is wrong, that house is not going to stand. You can't keep building
[02:08:37] on that house. You can't keep adding on to it. You can't keep making it better. The foundation
[02:08:41] is done. It's done. And the only difference between murder and self defense is intent. And
[02:08:51] nobody can question that. No, it, it is what it is. It's, it's black and white. It is,
[02:08:58] it is an, your intent is absolute. And that's ultimately, when you start digging down the root of this
[02:09:07] tree, that's ultimately what's going to decide if you're going to hold up in the bad times or not.
[02:09:13] Yeah, the, the thing is, I don't know if, you, I don't know if I caught exactly what you said,
[02:09:19] but I've seen people change their intent in their life. 100%. Okay. So I, I, I, I thought you said,
[02:09:28] like, oh, you can't change your intent. You can't change your intent of something that happened in the past.
[02:09:31] But if you've been running around looking out for yourself and stepping on people's backs and that's the
[02:09:38] way you roll, you can change that. You can actually begin to act like a good person. Yeah, but
[02:09:45] here's what I'll tell you is, is you can't be both. That is true. You can't, you can't, you can't,
[02:09:53] you can't be selfish and selfless. You're either one of the other. And there is no
[02:10:01] why I'm selfish at these times, but I'm selfless at these times. No, no, no, because then when you're
[02:10:06] selfless, you're only being selfless when you want to be selfless and that's selfish. Yeah, right?
[02:10:12] Like there's no being both in this life. Like you don't get to, you don't get to skirt the line.
[02:10:17] You're either all in on one of the other. And it's obvious. And there's no,
[02:10:22] there's no, there's no, there's no ex, there's no excuse for that. It is what it is.
[02:10:30] And you know it. And you know it on everything you do. You ultimately know it.
[02:10:36] Is it like a one time thing? I just, I've done it once. And then, you know, the only thing I'll do now
[02:10:44] is like a, like how you're still a sideband. If I, if I start feeling anxiety come around, right? Like,
[02:10:53] I'll, I'll just do a dose of still a sideband. Okay. So, so a sideband is mushroom. Mushrooms. Yeah.
[02:11:00] And, and then when you say you feel it coming, it's just like, hey, tomorrow, like I feel like I'm
[02:11:06] nervous about tomorrow or is it like, hey, I'm starting to feel nervous right now. Now I start like,
[02:11:12] like, you know, like I came home from that I would gain experience and like, I got to see the world
[02:11:17] and a place that I've never seen it. Like I got to see like with a relief that I had never felt,
[02:11:24] I didn't know that people could really walk around like this. And, you know, I, I mean, you got to take,
[02:11:34] I grew up in chaos. I mean, the only, a lot of times, you know, my, my biggest thing is
[02:11:40] is, is not like people talk about being in like the, the dark places. Why I'm comfortable there?
[02:11:49] The problem I have is is being in the light where there's not dark places. You know,
[02:11:54] I have the problem of being when there's no chaos. You want to talk about where I'm the best
[02:11:58] is, is you put me in the most chaotic environment and it needs to get figured out. Like,
[02:12:04] and the stakes are high? Well, that's, that's where I'm good. The problem I'm trying to learn is how to be okay
[02:12:12] when it's not chaotic. And that's what I have to, that's what I have to work on.
[02:12:19] How often do you feel like that anxiety is coming and you go like, like, how often do you feel like,
[02:12:25] oh, I better get a little bit of a little bit of a suicide and help me get through this.
[02:12:29] You know, once a quarter, one, like, so I'm just me personally. Like, I, I don't think,
[02:12:40] like, I don't, I don't know how to do this stuff. Do I look at as a recreational type of thing? Like, I don't,
[02:12:46] I don't think, I think if, if you're using it as a medicinal piece as a, not as a medicinal,
[02:12:54] of I'm going to do it every night, if I go to bed, you know what I mean? I can't, if you're using it to,
[02:13:00] because it's something you need. Nobody questioned somebody who takes blood pressure medicine.
[02:13:05] You know what I mean? Like, so, you know, for me about once a quarter, you know, and I'll do, like,
[02:13:12] I'll do a big dose, like, like, like a six or six or seven grams of psilocybin and
[02:13:25] then like, how, I'm good. It's like five hours and then I'm good.
[02:13:33] So before we wrap up this little section on, uh, this is, this is, this is,
[02:13:40] like I said, I talked to Tim and, and he just gave me a bunch of really good information,
[02:13:46] because I don't understand this stuff. I don't know about it. I've never done it before,
[02:13:52] and, but I've talked to so many of my friends that have had that it's helped them so much,
[02:13:58] you included, that I want, you know, I have an open mind. I want to understand it better.
[02:14:03] Um, you know, a couple of things that he said actually, there's a few things that he said,
[02:14:07] number one, like, because the veteran community has gone through such traumatic experiences,
[02:14:13] that's the main group to, to need this type of treatment. The other one is is survivors or victims
[02:14:21] of traumatic assaults, whether that's sexual assaults or physical assaults, but people that have been
[02:14:25] through that. So it's, but, but there's no federal funding for it. So there's no federal funding for it,
[02:14:32] which means there's no, there's, there's not enough money. It's just people that are donating,
[02:14:38] donating money to try and try and help get funding for more research. Um, the thing about
[02:14:47] specifically, he said about mushrooms, they've been used for thousands of years, right? So mushrooms
[02:14:53] have been used for thousands of years, um, and, and he also said, and this was interesting to me,
[02:15:00] like, there's no, you don't need, you don't want to do more. No, he said, you do something,
[02:15:07] and you're like, okay, I don't want to do more. It's not, it's not like heroin or cocaine,
[02:15:12] where we need to do cocaine apparently, because I've never done it, but apparently, when you do it,
[02:15:16] you just want to do more. When you do either I had a neighbor that had gotten out of prison and
[02:15:20] moved in with his uncle, and he was, he was out of prison after seven years, and he, um,
[02:15:26] he was on meth, and he said the first, he said, hey, the first time I did crystal meth,
[02:15:33] it was the only thing I ever wanted to do for the rest of my life. Yeah, so, and he went right
[02:15:39] down that path and stole from everybody that knew and freaking wrecked his life and ended up in jail.
[02:15:44] But, you know, what Tim was saying is like, there's, there's like an anti-addictive,
[02:15:49] like, um, because you can't, you don't want to do it every day. No, I mean, like, I couldn't
[02:15:57] imagine if you thought you were going to go out and party and somebody gave you a thing of
[02:16:00] eye-bogaine. You know what I mean? Like, like, like, like, like, I couldn't imagine if you thought
[02:16:06] you were going to go out and party and you took, you know, six to eight grams of still siren,
[02:16:11] like, for me personally, maybe I'm weak, but I, I just, I couldn't imagine and like, there's
[02:16:17] nothing about it. Like, it's like, work. Like, if I'm taking this, like, I know I'm going in to do some
[02:16:25] work. The, um, the way he was describing it to me and he certainly talked about the tattoo,
[02:16:32] you know, we're about leadership strategy and talking about detachment. He's like, oh yeah,
[02:16:35] here's what it is. He goes, uh, mushrooms, civil siren is like, it is your brain can detach and look
[02:16:43] at what is going on and then you can find a solution for it. And you just made a face like, yes,
[02:16:48] it's clarity. And I get off like, I come off of it and I can thank clear, then I've ever been able to
[02:16:54] think. He, he said, you know, I begin definitely got to be careful. He said there's cardiac risk,
[02:17:02] like you can have some significant problems from that, um, whereas mushrooms, he, he said,
[02:17:08] basically, I don't think there's any, like, reported ODs on mushrooms. You would have to do
[02:17:12] pounds of it. And there's no way he can do pounds of mushrooms. He also said that,
[02:17:20] he said, look, there's a whole warning thing, right? There's a whole, like, warning thing that you
[02:17:24] need to watch out for, uh, specifically if you've had schizophrenia in your family, it's like a
[02:17:30] big red flag. It's probably no go. They don't, when, when they're testing it, they don't test it on
[02:17:36] people that that have had those types of problems before. But, um, like you said, like, it's like
[02:17:47] these, these things are one to two, maybe three sessions and you don't need it anymore.
[02:17:52] So some of the other warnings look, there's legal, like there's, it's illegal. Yes, it's illegal.
[02:17:58] It's illegal. So you can't do it. You're not allowed to do it. You're not allowed to do it.
[02:18:03] Mm-hmm. Um, and if you get caught with it, you, you'll go jail. You go, you go to jail.
[02:18:09] So that's, that's number one, right? The other thing that Tim said is like,
[02:18:18] you've got a, for him, he's like, if somebody asked me about it, he says, here's the protocol.
[02:18:24] You, you know, a month of preparation. And the preparation that he's put on people is like,
[02:18:28] hey, you got to meditate every day. You got to, he's got some books to read. Um, you got to do that.
[02:18:34] He said, you got to look at it like, if you're getting knee surgery. If you're an athlete and
[02:18:38] getting knee surgery, what do you do? You go out. You research. You find the best doctor. You do the,
[02:18:42] there's prep work to get ready to have surgery. You got to like work out a certain way and do
[02:18:46] certain exercise to get ready. Then once you get the surgery done, you got to go into,
[02:18:50] you got to rehab and you, and it's what you said earlier, like, you got to do the work.
[02:18:54] You, you got to do the work. And like, if you're not willing to put in that work on the front end,
[02:19:01] you don't respect it enough to do it. You don't have, you don't want to get better. You don't
[02:19:06] want to use it for the intent that it needs to be used for, right? Like all these things,
[02:19:11] I take it very serious. Like, I don't, let me tell you something. Like, I, I mean, it's even
[02:19:18] hard for me to talk about like honestly, like, it just upfront. Like it's hard for me to even talk
[02:19:22] about in this room because it's like, this is something that I, in this room, a year ago, two years ago,
[02:19:30] would have looked at like, what are you doing? Right? And it's hard to bring that up around people
[02:19:37] that I know and trust because if they haven't, it's one of those things that if you haven't done it,
[02:19:43] but then I start thinking to myself, why can I drink alcohol? You know what I mean? Why,
[02:19:50] why can I do all these other things that somebody has allowed me to do? I could go to the VA right now
[02:19:56] and get prescribed clotapin. I could get Xanx's. I could be out of my mind on all these pharmaceuticals
[02:20:03] and that's acceptable in our society and addictive and addictive and bad for you. But this,
[02:20:13] this is even if I have to think about this, even if I have to go through my life. Let's say I do this
[02:20:18] once a quarter, the rest of my life. For five hours, once a quarter. Really? People go to bars.
[02:20:28] They spend more than that in a bar drinking alcohol on the weekends. Well, for me,
[02:20:37] like I said, I've got you and when you got, I actually like I'm like, how was it, man?
[02:20:40] I mean, how was it? And you were like, I feel freaking awesome now and I was like, okay,
[02:20:47] I mean, like if my friend can escape this pain and this suffering that you're in,
[02:20:53] like I want at least other people know about it and listen, there's like, there's all kinds of
[02:20:59] things you need to think about. It's preparation. It's making sure you understand it. It's
[02:21:03] finding the best doctor the right place. It's, it's also having a safety net in place before you do it
[02:21:09] because because it can't uncover things that you didn't think we're going to come. You didn't think
[02:21:14] this was coming and guess what, you get hit with it and it will. You get ambushed. So you better have
[02:21:18] some backup. You better have some safety net. You have to assume that you're going to need help when
[02:21:23] you're done with it. Getting the right environment, Tim said, take less than you think you can handle.
[02:21:31] Everyone's like, oh, I'm just going in hard. Like, dumb move. Yeah, dumb move. He did also mentioned
[02:21:38] a couple places where there's John Hopkins University, John Hopkins University is doing all kinds
[02:21:47] of experimentation to try and figure out how to use it properly. There's a bunch of other places
[02:21:51] that are doing it as well. There's something called maps.org, map.org, maps.org, which is the
[02:21:59] multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies. That's it. That's, this is if you want to
[02:22:05] support what we're talking about. If you want to try and get it, so it's not underground. Right?
[02:22:11] Because if you can go get prescribed X and whatever other things that you're talking about, or you can
[02:22:15] just go down to the freaking corner store and buy a bottle of whiskey and a knee-brie at yourself,
[02:22:21] which all it does is cover up the problems, numbs the problems. If you would like to say,
[02:22:25] hey, maybe we should take a different approach, you can go to maps.org, you can go to
[02:22:30] usesonainstitute.org. It's just another, it's USO N-A-I-N-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.org. To try to donate or whatever,
[02:22:46] you can support there and then just universities that are out there that are doing this.
[02:22:51] He told me a couple documentaries that will help you have better understanding one of them's
[02:22:56] called Trip of Compassion and apparently it's super intense. Apparently they show this therapy
[02:23:04] taking place and it's like really intense. And the other one is called Fantastic Fungi. Let me say that
[02:23:15] right? Fungi. Fungi. Fungi. Fungi. Which is kind of a Alice kind of like, oh, that's kind of,
[02:23:20] it sounds like whatever, almost a comedic right name and then he told me what it's about and
[02:23:25] what it's about is they've got people that are have some kind of terminal disease. In many cases
[02:23:32] older people, but people that are people like you what, what we're talking about where people that
[02:23:38] would never think about doing anything like this in their lives and they haven't for 40, 60,
[02:23:42] 80 years and they're doing these drugs in order to overcome or be comfortable as they face death.
[02:23:54] Yeah. And something like he says that there's like grandmalls on there that you know never
[02:23:59] drank in their life and they're on there saying this is the best thing that I've ever done. So
[02:24:05] definitely some look this again. I'm I'm no pro do research, but it's something that we
[02:24:14] need to start talking about because if it can help us out, if it's been helping people for
[02:24:20] a long time anyways, you know, with the case of mushrooms been helping for thousands of years,
[02:24:24] if there's something, if there's a way to help people, let's freaking research it, let's find out
[02:24:30] how to do it right and let's let's get people to a situation where they can do it legally,
[02:24:36] but again doing it with the right intent. Yeah, with the right intent. And I'm telling you,
[02:24:43] drinking is way easier than going in and facing and working through what you see with this.
[02:24:52] Drinking is easier going and you know running away from your problems is way easier. This is a
[02:25:00] this is where it's going to it's going to look you in the eyes and you're going to if you want to
[02:25:05] work on it, you'll work on it. I mean, and it's so hard. It sounds like even me talking about it.
[02:25:09] It sounds so crazy. Just even talking about it like that. But it's really like for example,
[02:25:15] the last time I did it. I mean, I I I I I sit there and looked at my teammates dead,
[02:25:21] but you know what I looked at it and I waited. I was okay with it. I came out of it and I was okay
[02:25:28] with it. Yeah, did I still feel the hurt? Yeah, there was I said I got to see my grandparents,
[02:25:33] which I loved more than anything. But I was okay with it. Yeah, it's okay to it's a normal reaction
[02:25:43] to to hurt from it to miss them, but it's not normal to let these actions dictate the rest of your life.
[02:25:51] And that was where it did it gave me the perspective of seeing it again on my terms.
[02:25:55] And it and hopefully with that did is it processed it now. It's out, check.
[02:26:05] Proceed with caution with caution with caution. Let's talk about something that's a little less
[02:26:15] controversial, but also provides a massive amount of healing in my humble opinion. A little something
[02:26:21] called jujitsu. How's the jujitsu coming along, man? You know, I haven't I haven't rolled much lately.
[02:26:30] I was rolling quite a bit whenever all the the COVID hit right now. Everything got shut down.
[02:26:37] I feel like I'll probably be a white belt for life. We're all white belts for life.
[02:26:44] I yeah, I mean, I haven't got the role of time lately. I think I rolled maybe like a month ago,
[02:26:50] but I just I hadn't been able to get back around to there's plenty of jujitsu to go on and
[02:26:57] allstate. Roger that. Tim Kennedy just FYI your brother here has not been rolling lately.
[02:27:03] I'm sure you will help remedy that situation. One of the things that you know for me,
[02:27:09] jujitsu is is so important for so many reasons. And it's aligned with the reasons of like
[02:27:16] being in shape, working out, working out every day. To me, that's that's therapy. That's therapy.
[02:27:23] Right. That's therapy for me. And I know it's therapy for a lot of people. And I know,
[02:27:28] hey, give me one day for where for whatever reason I literally can't work out. Like,
[02:27:34] whatever it is. Like, I woke up at three o'clock in the morning to travel and then when I got home,
[02:27:38] the water he could, where it's broken and I had three clients call me and then my kid was sick.
[02:27:41] And what I, whatever the thing is, it just didn't happen. I can feel it. Right. It's like a mental,
[02:27:50] negative emotion that's going on. Yeah. If I, if it's like seven o'clock at night,
[02:27:59] my wife's about to serve dinner and I didn't get to work on it. Go, hey, give me 30 minutes.
[02:28:03] I'm going to go hammer one out. It's like a whole bunch of whole bunch of whole
[02:28:07] little changes. But whole world change. Hey, my time that you've worked out and you left and you're,
[02:28:11] you're not happy that you worked on my bum that did that. Oh, man. So fitness, huge thing. And I,
[02:28:17] I know that speaking of fitness, what's up with this new freaking like application you got out?
[02:28:23] Yeah. Talk to me about this. I just, I just launched this news. So like, I've always wanted, look,
[02:28:28] I don't, I don't want to be a bodybuilder. Like, I have no credibility. I don't have no idea how
[02:28:33] you can do it, right? I don't want to be a trainer. I don't want to be any of those, right? But like,
[02:28:38] I do enjoy the therapy side of working out of of staying in shape, of being able to, you know,
[02:28:45] know that that if we get a fire, I can go perform or knowing that I can get us out, you know,
[02:28:51] like, I mean, I, I, I still get a truck to go get after it, right? Like, I have to be a dad to my,
[02:28:57] you know, to my daughters and, and look, at some point in a few years when I'm older,
[02:29:02] they'll be dating boys and I still have to be able to kick their ass, right? So I take that very
[02:29:07] serious. You know, so I, I still have this, I know how to train. And to me, you know,
[02:29:18] I feel like the closest I became, all my, look at, look at what all my friends have in common,
[02:29:23] they all train. You know why? Because, you know, where we got close to our closest friends,
[02:29:29] suffering and training together, right? I mean, that's it. And so, you know, I tell you,
[02:29:35] build a team. I launch this new app. It's on owned the dash training.com and you can get on there.
[02:29:40] We got workouts on there. Um, getting workout, same stuff I do, right? It's not about,
[02:29:46] are you going to get on there with a program to come out as a bodybuilder? No, I don't,
[02:29:49] I don't want to be that. But if you want to get on there and get after it and have a program,
[02:29:52] you can follow to get after it and to be able to leave and know you did something. It's like,
[02:29:57] I call it practical fitness. It's like, you don't, it's not complicated. I'm a simple guy. I get it done
[02:30:04] where I can. I like to think it's efficient. You know, it's efficient. I just get in what I can with
[02:30:09] what I got. And that's what it is. So you real quickly, like, just mentioned, oh, when I'm out
[02:30:15] getting on the truck. Because you're a firefighter. Yeah, firefighter, you know, I did that last
[02:30:20] year. I got knocked that out last year because, you know, during COVID and I was like, man, I really want
[02:30:26] to get back. I really want to, I really want to, I feel like I just, I have more to give. Like,
[02:30:33] this country's giving me so much people. I've given me so much. And I just, I feel like I have an obligation
[02:30:39] to give. And I want to do it by being able to put my hands on people and being able to be there
[02:30:44] in their worst moments. And so yeah, I went got my certification, became an EMT, became a firefighter.
[02:30:49] I got my commission in Texas. And yeah, so I was paid for probably six months, five, four,
[02:31:00] five, six months. And then just my, my speeches and stuff started coming back. So I had to get off
[02:31:04] the truck. And, you know, me, you talked about, I mean, I wasn't a forever thing. It was more about
[02:31:08] getting experience and trying to just sharpen that craft. And then, you know, now I still volunteer.
[02:31:13] And then I'm, hopefully I'll start doing some part time stuff, start picking up some shifts at this,
[02:31:19] this, uh, one of my, one of my closest mentors in the fire service, Sam Stacks has just been there
[02:31:26] for me the whole time and just kind of led me through like he's like the, we call him though, you
[02:31:31] know, you know, the white bearers, right? Like he's like the white bearer to the fire service,
[02:31:35] you know him. And, um, just been there close for, and so anyways, I did that. And, you know, I just
[02:31:41] get out there and try to try to help people when they need it. And it's awesome, man.
[02:31:46] I, uh, I, uh, I've talked to a lot of fire departments in the country and a lot of fire departments
[02:31:54] use the principles from extreme ownership, from dichotomy leadership, from leadership strategy
[02:31:58] and tactics. We, we work with these guys a lot. And I, I always feel like, hey, I appreciate what you guys
[02:32:07] do. I know it's a hard job. I know it's like a rough job. I know that you see a lot of stuff that
[02:32:14] sucks. And I know that a lot of it is like note like you, you, you think of firefighting, you think of like
[02:32:20] a movie like back draft where it's like all kind of dangerous, but heroic. And the other part of it
[02:32:28] that I know exists is the part that's like heroic, yes, but a different kind of heroic. And man,
[02:32:37] you and I have had some conversations about that that even up to my appreciation for firefighters and
[02:32:45] EMTs even more when you're talking about just the day to day life. I mean, it is, yeah, let me tell you,
[02:32:57] first off, let's let's talk about police and like, uh, EMS side of it, police, paramedics, EMTs,
[02:33:05] police, let me tell you, they are the unsung heroes of this nation. The, the strain that is put on
[02:33:18] our, uh, the film, the system that we have, the demand from them. They're overworked, they're treated
[02:33:27] like shit, um, on deployment 365 days a year. On deployment 365 days a year. On deployment 365 days a year.
[02:33:35] And I'm telling you, they are dealing with the, the piece of the world that we want to pretend
[02:33:41] does not exist. And it is here. Um, the respect for them is, if you see a cop, you see a, any of them,
[02:33:54] a first responder, you should thank them and you should thank from the bottom of your heart
[02:34:01] for what they do that you don't have to see. Um, I had no clue as much as I pretended like I thought I
[02:34:09] did. I had no clue. The stuff that I see have seen, but just since I've been doing it,
[02:34:16] is, is worse than anything I've seen in Afghanistan. Um, almost daily basis. Yeah, I mean,
[02:34:27] you'll, you have shifts that nothing goes on, but you have days where it sucks. And, um,
[02:34:34] yeah, it's in, and it's, what they go through is just, you, you can't,
[02:34:39] what, what I went through in Afghanistan, which I'm not going to say is for everybody,
[02:34:43] is, is, is what everybody's gone through, um, but it can't touch what I've seen here in, in,
[02:34:50] in the United States. And, you know, I'll tell you where it really hit me one time.
[02:34:57] Is whenever I, uh, I was working on ambulance, uh, me and my, one of my closest friends,
[02:35:03] um, when we, when we pull up and, um, to call where a kid hung himself. And, uh,
[02:35:14] I'm never forget it was like a hanging and I'm never forget he looked at me. He's
[02:35:18] way, I mean, this dude is talking about solid. Real, he's, he's, he's awesome. He looked at me
[02:35:23] and goes, hey, make sure when we get out, grab the bolt cutters. He's like, uh, you never know,
[02:35:27] like, if they hung themselves with something, other, like I never even thought about that, right?
[02:35:31] Like this guy just, you know, you just, you walk in and you just see, you know, you can't,
[02:35:39] this is not war. This isn't somebody shooting at you because they hate you. I mean, this is a
[02:35:43] kid who was so lonely that he hung himself. And this is what happens. This is happening in our world
[02:35:50] every day. Has anybody ever thought about who comes and takes care of this?
[02:35:54] You know, and it's the car ricks. You know, the, the, the, you know, it's just, it's something that we
[02:36:06] try to pretend that doesn't exist. And you got these people who were just going out and doing this
[02:36:12] every day. I have no clue as what they've gone through. I've seen a little just about this much of it.
[02:36:16] Just a, a smidge of it. But they go out and they get up in the middle of the night to go and
[02:36:20] be there for when you dial 911 and it's like these, these people. Um, not me, but these people
[02:36:29] that I have, got to work with, that I've got to see who have done this for years. Like they really are
[02:36:37] the real life Batman's Superman. You look at it. Like, you know, they, when you call them,
[02:36:48] they go and answer whatever needs you need in the worst moments of your life.
[02:36:56] And they go back and they live theirs and they walk the streets among us and they don't ask for anything.
[02:37:02] And it is crazy. They are, they are really gods in. And it's, it's incredible. And like,
[02:37:10] you know, the appreciation I have for them just getting to work next to them. I just, I'm honored to just be
[02:37:16] able to be around them. But it's, you talk about the world, the world right around us.
[02:37:25] I mean, the houses that you walk into, you're just so sad. I mean, it's the people you see,
[02:37:30] the overdoses. And, and you know, you're just like, I'm telling you right now,
[02:37:34] the one thing that I have have been able to see is that people are hurting.
[02:37:39] And yeah, but I'll tell you this, it's a, it's been the most fulfilling thing I've done.
[02:37:50] You know, how cool is it to be somebody to be the person that can show up when somebody
[02:37:58] calls 911 because they don't know how to figure it out. How cool is that to be able to come up
[02:38:03] on a scene to where everything's chaotic and they just need somebody to help them get through that
[02:38:08] moment and you get to be that person, right? And that's where I think like my perspective has changed
[02:38:13] on all this, like with my teammates or with all the people I've seen die and all this, like,
[02:38:20] you know what's kind of cool is, man, is I, for some reason, I keep getting put in these positions
[02:38:26] and it's an honor because I get to be the person that's there with them as their soul leaves their
[02:38:31] body and how cool is that to be able to share that moment with somebody. There are last moments on
[02:38:39] this earth. I sometimes I get to share that with them, these people and it's an honor. Like I walk away
[02:38:47] and does it bother me? Of course it bothers me. But now I get to say, hey, you know what,
[02:38:52] it was an honor. It was an honor that you shared that moment with me. Whether you obviously didn't
[02:38:58] choose to, but obviously we're here for a reason and I get to do this and it is like, it's awesome.
[02:39:06] It is awesome. It's awesome. I've been lucky enough to work with police departments around the
[02:39:17] country and what's interesting about what you were saying is that like you said, it's underneath
[02:39:23] the surface, right? And I think when you see something on the news, you know, you see a shooting on
[02:39:29] the news or a suicide or an overdose, we have a tendency to think that it's somewhere else.
[02:39:38] Yeah, it's someone else. And I'm telling you small towns, big towns, cities, country, rural,
[02:39:46] north, south, east, west. You don't have to go very far, quote beneath the surface because,
[02:39:55] by the way, socio-economic class doesn't matter. You go to rich people's houses, you go to poor
[02:40:02] people's houses, you go to the projects and there's people that are in their worst moments.
[02:40:09] And then worst moments. And like you said, it's these first responders that are out there
[02:40:20] that they answer that call every time. Every single time, every single time. And they do it for years.
[02:40:30] They do it for years and on and it is like watching them, you know, just like literally,
[02:40:41] they prepare for the unknown. They never know what the call is going to be. Like they literally
[02:40:47] wake up every day to be, whatever you need them to be when they need to be it. And I'm telling you,
[02:40:53] and they do it and they do it. They're, it's such a police, especially like police,
[02:41:00] such a thankless job obviously right now, right? And they're out there doing their best and they're out there,
[02:41:05] just trying to, just trying to, to be what people need them to be. And at the end of the day,
[02:41:11] they're no different than you are. There are mother, there are sister, there are father,
[02:41:18] there are son, there are no different than you are. The only difference is that they chose to put a
[02:41:24] badge on to go serve other people. They're not, they're not some trained robot. They're not
[02:41:34] some person who is, you know, was was born with all these, mind reading activities or can
[02:41:41] read the future to know if someone's going to kill them tonight. They are just like you are. They are
[02:41:46] as scared as you are. They, they don't want to do, like they got their own problems at home and
[02:41:53] guess what they do. They choose to set theirs aside and they don't, let me tell you upfront,
[02:41:58] they don't do it for the pay. They do not do it for the pay. They, they don't do that. They do it because
[02:42:06] they care about people. I don't care. They're intent. They don't stay in that job without good intent.
[02:42:13] It's not possible. It is not possible. It ain't worth it. It is not worth it. But it's awesome, man. It's
[02:42:24] awesome. Like it's just awesome. Like I, I would get on a truck with these guys and I would just
[02:42:28] look at them and all of just like no matter how chaotic it got, they, they had it and it was like,
[02:42:35] this is awesome. I want to be one of them. How often do you walk around and say that? I want to be
[02:42:42] one of them. It's badass. They're badass. Absolutely. All you mentioned a couple of times today,
[02:42:50] the new book, the new book coming out, tells about the new book, the way forward.
[02:42:56] Yeah. So I wrote a book. Me and Rob, oh, Neil, we speak for the same speaking agents.
[02:43:08] Me and Rob connected on not necessarily about like combat stuff. But just more about
[02:43:15] this life. We both come from small towns. We both are somewhere that neither one of us
[02:43:21] you know, ever thought we would be, right? You know, and we both have stuff that haunts us. And
[02:43:30] that was kind of where we connected of like, how do we put a book together, kind of talking about
[02:43:36] giving some perspective that we're no different than anybody else. You know, that's the
[02:43:43] one thing that I always felt like a lot of these war books came back, right after you know,
[02:43:49] these war books came out. And I feel like all the way up until Chris Collins movie, there wasn't
[02:43:56] really that humanization piece, right? And Chris Collins movie, they they showed more of the, when he
[02:44:02] was coming back home between deployments, the struggle sometimes, right? And I think that was a first
[02:44:07] time in any of the movies that it ever really hit. And you know, I always felt like in our books that
[02:44:15] we wrote, we built ourselves up to be something great, but we never showed that we never humanized
[02:44:21] the factors of war. And you know, that was a piece that always got me and we kind of like
[02:44:28] when I came home. And so like, you know, in the way forward, it's just about life, like a lot of
[02:44:34] stories that I told today, you know, that I've against stories in there, right? Like the, you know,
[02:44:39] the story I talk about my grandpa, you know, just about, you know, the the circle. I talk about my
[02:44:44] circle and what I talk about Tim Kennedy, the story I told you. I put that in there about how like
[02:44:49] between Tim, Shane, and Brandon, my friends about how like, you know, you got the sword, the
[02:44:58] shield in the armor, right? And those are like that, that how each of them fit. And you know,
[02:45:06] I talk about, you know, my struggles in Alaska, I talk about, not, you know, about like my
[02:45:12] divorce. I talk, you know, I talk about all this and I talk about more of the human fact side of it,
[02:45:16] to human eyes about who we are. And I know, and I think it's going to be great. It comes out in July,
[02:45:22] and I think it's going to be great because at, you know, I think it's coming at a probably a good time
[02:45:27] in the country of where people are looking for a way forward, right? And that's kind of where it
[02:45:34] comes around. So what's the layout? What's the, normally, as you know, I read books before
[02:45:41] people come on here, but in this case, you handed it to me today. And so you've got a new book
[02:45:45] coming up. So what's the format of it? So basically, in each chapter, Rod tells a story,
[02:45:53] you can find all story. For each chapter? For each chapter. Is there a common theme between you?
[02:45:57] Yeah, so like if you look at like if you, you know, when you read it, you know, I haven't looked at it
[02:46:01] because you know what, you can give it to me. So today. So that's your tricky way of getting back here again.
[02:46:07] Yeah, you know, like that, right? So you know, you talk about like American boys, like that's the first
[02:46:13] chapter taking aim, find your heroes, you know, drilling and open your eyes. Like, you know, I talk about,
[02:46:19] I kind of, you know, like one of the stories I talk about in here that I felt like,
[02:46:24] you know, my cousin Steven was, I mean, you talk about a guy who was always there for me, right?
[02:46:29] And especially one of my biggest cheerleaders when I went to Marine Corps. And,
[02:46:34] um, man, when I came back and I was just in that dark mode, um, you know, he had a kid,
[02:46:44] and married and all this and like he got busy, right? And, you know, he just wasn't answering the phone.
[02:46:49] And I took it as, he's like, leaving me, leaving me hanging, right? But really, now that I'm a father,
[02:46:55] I get it. Um, so, mean him got into it pretty bad and like, I tell you, I, uh,
[02:47:05] I'll over it just because of ego and resentment. Um, I invited everybody in my family except him
[02:47:12] to the metal of honor ceremony. And, uh, you know, man, I, that's one of the dudes that stood by me
[02:47:22] the whole time, you know? And, uh, just, just stuff like that, like, lessons of,
[02:47:28] hopefully, if I can't meet somebody that they can read this book and, and maybe it touches their
[02:47:33] life to say, you know what, maybe I'm doing this in my life right now before I go and, and mess it up,
[02:47:38] even worse, you know, maybe I, you can look at this as, as a little bit of perspective that maybe
[02:47:43] maybe some mentorship, you know, um, but yeah, it's just all stories about that, that you should be able,
[02:47:50] you know, everybody could relate to whether you served in combat or you didn't, and Rob's is the same way,
[02:47:55] you know, Rob's just talking about, um, basketball about growing up and, you know,
[02:48:01] you Montana, I mean, Rob has got some funny stories. I'm laughing because, um,
[02:48:07] Rob and I were on deployment. It was like 99 or 2000. And I don't even think we had aimed,
[02:48:14] we were like, went to the gym to work out. And there were some dudes playing basketball.
[02:48:19] Yeah. And I played basketball. I sucked, but like I played basketball in high school, you know,
[02:48:23] when I was a point card, so I could like dribble at some ballhandling skills. I could pass and whatnot,
[02:48:28] but I, I would like get more steals in a game than I would points, right? Parts because of my
[02:48:32] position, but parts because I, and I was like, I was a hustler, right? I would be, I'd every game
[02:48:37] I'd be with like skin knees and skin, it looks like dive on every ball. Well, well, Rob's like, uh,
[02:48:44] he played a little bit of college ball and being from Montana, most of the time you find
[02:48:48] with people that are from the north, they're really good at shooting because, you know, you can't
[02:48:52] dribble in the wintertime. So you just sit out there and shoot, shoot, oops. So he could, he could,
[02:48:57] he could shoot. And we're like walking across, you know, in our running shoes, ready to go work out.
[02:49:01] And there's some guys, you know, playing some ball. We had one, I think we had one or two other
[02:49:06] guys with us. Yeah. And you know, Rob, you know, constantly talking shit to everybody. You know,
[02:49:11] he said something like, oh, nice shot, you know, the dudes were like, oh, you guys want some?
[02:49:14] And Rob's like, yeah. Yeah. And you know, these kids were wearing, you know, air Jordan.
[02:49:20] And they were like, they were ready to run some game on us. Nike shot. Yeah. Yeah. Nike shocks and stuff.
[02:49:26] And Rob, I mean, I get, no, you, he's a little taller, right? What's he? Six one, Pice.
[02:49:32] Yeah, six, six, six, one. Yeah, maybe six ones. But you're not looking at him thinking he's a baller,
[02:49:35] especially he's like, you know, a pale white dude with red hair with red hair. And, you know,
[02:49:40] so they're looking at us like, oh, these nerds and sure enough, man, like, it's a great combo.
[02:49:47] Because I could, I could ball handling. And I could just, I would just feed him and he's just hitting jump shot,
[02:49:51] jump shot, outside shot, jump shot. We just destroyed him and we walked off and we've Rob still talking shit.
[02:49:58] You know, like, yeah, I mean, you know, I, I love Rob death.
[02:50:02] Uh, great guy. Um, you know, he's, he's always been, I tell you what, he's been one of my biggest cheerleaders.
[02:50:11] Yeah, and it was just, it was, we wrote this book together. I think it's, you know, it's going to be good.
[02:50:15] You know, hopefully it gets out there and helps people and yeah, you know, it's going to be awesome.
[02:50:20] Right on, well, I look forward to reading it now that I have a copy.
[02:50:23] Yeah. What else, what's the future? What else you got coming up? You know, I,
[02:50:28] you know, getting, you know, getting, we're going to do this book tour starting July.
[02:50:35] We're out there. We're, uh, pushing the discipline go. Right. The best flavor there is.
[02:50:42] Dax, that's right. So, you know, Dax, have it. Um,
[02:50:47] Dax, have it. So you got your own energy drink is what I'm hearing. Well, I don't, I'm on flavor. Yes.
[02:50:52] Okay. Well, it's kind of easier. Yeah. Dax, have it, you know.
[02:50:55] Um, it's uh, wins the tour taking place. So why do you lie? And then what do you,
[02:51:00] you guys are going to different cities? Yeah. So, you know, we're, well, I guess we'll see
[02:51:04] you, right? I mean, the right. Because of Miss Rona. Well, yeah. I mean, you know, that,
[02:51:08] I guess they're like, they're doing virtual book signing. So we're going to have those going. But,
[02:51:11] but, you know, me and Rob both have talked it. We want to get on the road. Like, we want to go out and see people.
[02:51:16] I want to honestly, man, I just want to go and get around people and be able to fire people up,
[02:51:20] get them excited about life again. You know, get them excited. Look, it's going to be all right. Like,
[02:51:24] we're going to, we're going to get through this, you know, get out of the TV, get, get out of, get,
[02:51:29] turn, turn the news off, get off social media and stop believing what people tell you and just
[02:51:36] look around and believe what you see. Right. And, um, yeah. So that's, that's that, you know,
[02:51:42] that's kind of, it's kind of what we're doing to crushing it. Well, before we jump into this support,
[02:51:47] I kind of wanted to wrap this up, um, bringing it back to, to Colonel Charles Wittlesley, Wittlesie.
[02:51:59] So at his memorial service, there was a friend of his family. This is in Petsfield,
[02:52:05] Massachusetts, Adam and Wittleservice. And this family friend, who is also a judge,
[02:52:12] a guy by the name of Charles Hibbert, he, uh, he delivered the, the ulogy.
[02:52:23] And this is what he said, quote, we can sit here and say, he had so much to live for.
[02:52:32] Family, friends, and all that makes life sweet. But no, my friends,
[02:52:46] life span for him was measured those days in that distant forest. He had plumbed the depth of
[02:52:55] tragic suffering. He had heard the world's applause. He had seen and touched the great realities of life.
[02:53:08] And what remained was of little consequence. He craved, rest, peace, and sweet forgetfulness.
[02:53:26] He thought it out quietly, serenely, confidently, minutely. He came to a decision not lightly or
[02:53:42] unadvisately, and in the end did what he thought was best. And in the comfort of that,
[02:53:55] we too must rest and quote and I disagree. I don't think we can rest. I don't think we should
[02:54:18] rest. I think we must not rest. What I think we should do is help. I think we need to help
[02:54:28] are veterans that are suffering and not just veterans, but people from all walks of life because
[02:54:39] life is hard.
[02:54:41] And no matter who you are, you either are facing or you will be facing disappointment
[02:54:57] and despondency and loss. But don't give up. Just you got to keep fighting.
[02:55:17] You got to get out of that echo chamber that your head is trapped in. You got to build relationships
[02:55:28] with people. Then you got to move forward. Not just for yourself, but for the people around you.
[02:55:40] So let's not rest. Let's help. Thanks for coming along, man.
[02:56:04] Thanks for having me. And with what you're saying, that ain't quote, I agree. I tell people all
[02:56:12] the time you do matter. You do. The biggest lies, the biggest lies that are told are the ones you
[02:56:22] tell yourself. And just as the good times, they don't last forever, neither to the bad.
[02:56:30] And you do matter. You do matter. Somebody somewhere is relying on you. Somebody somewhere.
[02:56:39] Whether you've met on me or not, they will be relying on you and you do matter. And I'm with you.
[02:56:46] Look, there's nothing weak about it. There's nothing struggle is struggle. You know, a lot of times
[02:56:53] people, they see us as that, that, that, you know, we don't struggle or we don't have hard days,
[02:57:00] because we don't necessarily walk around and talk about all the time, but like the hardest, even the
[02:57:05] hardest people on earth, they got hard, not because easy times, they got hard because of hard days,
[02:57:12] and they got through it. And it's a choice. And you just have to continue to choose to get through it.
[02:57:20] And it's worth it. Indeed. Thanks for having me. Yeah, man. It's a freaking honor to have you on here.
[02:57:33] Echo Charles. Yes. I'm not quite 100% sure that it's an honor for me to have you on here, but it's
[02:57:42] pretty cool. Oh, it's an honor for you. Thank you. It's always an honor for me to be in your presence.
[02:57:51] Yes, very, very big pleasure for you. We want to help ourselves. We want to help others.
[02:57:56] What do you reckon? Select. What do you mean?
[02:57:58] Hey, do you still have a fire helicopter? I sold it, but I'm getting another one. Are you getting like a
[02:58:05] better one? I don't know what I'm making for one. Do you see different ones? Why was that one? No,
[02:58:08] good. No, no, no, no, no, no. They only have like so many hours. Was that one getting close to the end?
[02:58:16] Yeah. What do you mean like a projector light bulb kind of thing? Well, like after like so many hours,
[02:58:20] they have to be rebuilt. Yeah. What models that one that you have are 44, Raventune? And those are like
[02:58:27] very common. Yeah. They're like the Toyota Corolla of helicopters. Yeah. It's fun. It's a thought of
[02:58:34] this video idea of a while ago, like last year. So like, let's do it. Now he's in the execution phase now.
[02:58:40] So he likes to, he likes to, he likes to do it. No, no, I got, we got my buddies. We got like
[02:58:45] four or five of them out there. So let's do it. Well, I gained access to a 3D model of your helicopter.
[02:58:52] And I saw little videos of it. So I'm like, and so I made it look like you're, so I was going to do something.
[02:58:57] But yeah. But you know, it's been a decade. It's been a decade. I'd be a for a year. That's what kind of,
[02:59:05] you know, actively we got going on over there. Still doing my research. Hey, the last podcast that just
[02:59:10] came out. It's two, I think it's 275. Yeah, 275 helicopter pilot from Vietnam. And there's the best.
[02:59:20] You, you, you use a check it out for sure because he just flying that huian. We kind of got more into
[02:59:27] the, like a, just questions about like flying that thing and how hard it is to fly a helicopter.
[02:59:34] And there was one quote in there. His dad was a master chief in the Navy. So this guy is a freaking
[02:59:40] worn officer, whatever, worn officer too. And his dad is a master chief in the Navy. Oh,
[02:59:46] was a match. He became like Lieutenant Commander in Navy. And then goes to see him.
[02:59:51] Or no, he's stationed in Saigon. The, the dads in Saigon, like we're doing some bureaucratic,
[02:59:56] whatever logistics thing. And the sons up freaking fine. Ops every day. He goes and picks up his
[03:00:02] dad and brings him up to wherever they were out in the bush and starts flying missions with his
[03:00:07] dad. It's dads on the 50 cow. He's dad's like, is that like 45 years old like a Lieutenant Commander
[03:00:13] up there just get, they get into firefight's bro. He's dads on the 50 cow. Anyways, his dad says
[03:00:19] to him like after a couple of days ago. You know, I, I, I work with a lot of Air Force guys and
[03:00:24] those Air Force, those jet fighter pilots, you know, they're always so positive. They're always
[03:00:27] having such a good time. And you guys are all miserable walking around like everything's horrible.
[03:00:32] What's up with that? And he says, well, dad, Air Force fighter pilot is flying an aircraft that
[03:00:39] wants to fly that, that, that if you don't do anything, it's kind of going to just keep flying.
[03:00:44] Yeah. He goes, we're flying something that doesn't want to fly. It wants to fly. And if we don't
[03:00:49] balance these four different things, it's going to go down. And we're close enough to
[03:00:53] know that people are shooting at us with machine guns and RPGs and everything else on top of it.
[03:00:57] So you want to know why we're freaking stressed? That's why. Next question. Next question, dad.
[03:01:04] He's talking about a father's son relationship after that. Dude, freaking crazy, right? It's crazy.
[03:01:10] Hey, dad, I'm going to come pick you up when I'm going to take you on to run some.
[03:01:13] They did three days of operations. That's crazy. His dad shot and look, he is that shot
[03:01:19] a 50 cow. Who shooting a 50 cow out of the, out of the Huey? That's kind of move a Huey a little
[03:01:24] bit. Don't you think? Like you're moving a little bit. I don't know. I'm not, they got so much power.
[03:01:31] Yeah, I know things are. Yeah, damn, but the thing is, they do, but it's weird talking to him.
[03:01:40] It's the first time that I really got the feeling of like, man, how in touch with those aircraft
[03:01:46] those guys were? Yeah, like you, you can't be reactive. Like it's like balancing yourself on a
[03:01:51] beach ball. Yeah, and it's part of them. Yeah, they flew to the point where it's part of them. And so that's
[03:01:56] why I say like when they're like, like there'd be like a little thing like, uh, they could tell
[03:02:01] like how much weight they had on. They're like, oh, we're 100 pounds heavy. How do you tell your
[03:02:06] 100 pounds heavy on a freaking helicopter? The way they could, they were just, they just knew
[03:02:09] everything and they were so in touch with those birds. It's freaking nuts, man. Yeah, it's the power load.
[03:02:15] Yeah, I'm much power. It takes to come all. Yeah, freaking crazy. Yeah. Um, yeah, awesome. So echo
[03:02:24] Charles, trying to get better. Yes. Trying to be better. What do you recommend? Well, let's start
[03:02:31] with these illustrious healthy energy drinks. You know, we don't all have our own flavor.
[03:02:39] Maybe someone's doing something. I'm like, you said, I'm a little bit like a
[03:02:43] little, you're not all so small. That's all that. Look at that. Some of them will still. But
[03:02:46] either way, flavor, whichever flavor, these are good things. Tell us about uh, it was kind of
[03:02:52] interesting. How did you end up with this? Who'd you talk to? You? Always me?
[03:03:05] You said you're still in touch. I can't remember. Yeah. I don't know. What'd you call me up and say,
[03:03:10] yeah, I should have my own flavor? No, no, you, you said it after I, I got
[03:03:16] rabbedo on the other energy drink. Right. And you're like, I was like, oh, I remember saying, bro,
[03:03:21] you can't be drinking that stuff. What's in it? It's this, this, this, I went through
[03:03:25] everything like, bro, let me send you some real shit. Yeah. And then you're like,
[03:03:28] we'll make your own flavor. Yeah, then I said, what flavor do you want? What flavor do you like?
[03:03:32] Do you see, how did you forget? Well, how are you gonna add? Oh, I remember that. No.
[03:03:38] Yes. I remember that now. But I remember saying like, well, what flavor do you like?
[03:03:43] And you're like, I like Dr. Pepper. And I was like, okay. All right. We can work with that.
[03:03:48] Because that's a cult following Dr. Pepper. It is. People is a cult following. But who wants to drink
[03:03:56] high-frupped, those current syrup? Who wants to drink that? Well, probably nobody. If they knew
[03:04:01] the reality, nobody wants to drink it. No, I hate it. So what we're talking about is this drink
[03:04:07] right here? Well, his drink is called back savage. Back savage. It is black cherry vanilla.
[03:04:18] It's totally healthy for you. How many did you drink? You just drink three?
[03:04:23] That drink, three, two. You guys are fired up, man.
[03:04:27] That's cool. We have to drink three to stay on your level. I don't know, man. I don't know. I can't
[03:04:33] even remember that conversation with you about this. All right. So we got we got these awesome drinks.
[03:04:39] If you want to get one go to get some go to jockelfuel.com and you can order them. You can also
[03:04:44] get them from wall wall on the out on the east coast. By the wall wall, by the way, wall wall
[03:04:49] put like put the brakes on me a little bit. They're like, well, because people are like going in
[03:04:55] there and buying all of them. And we had to get our supply chain caught back up. So, by changing
[03:05:00] it's caught back up. So roll on roll. Go get some clear those shelves. Tax average. Yeah.
[03:05:07] Tax average. Tax average is your flavor. Yeah. So there you go. What else? Interesting. These drinks
[03:05:14] is like one of those things where it's like, oh, yeah, I'm trying to improve. Let me do a, I don't
[03:05:17] know, a pre workout. We'll call it a traditional pre workout energy drinks scenario. Technically,
[03:05:24] I mean, it's, that's like a short term. Oh, very short. Half thing with long term detriment.
[03:05:30] Yeah, I was going to say it's not just short term like, oh, but I feel good for a minute. No,
[03:05:34] and now I legitimately am going backwards. I'm less healthy. Literally less healthy. Yeah.
[03:05:39] No, do that. This is not like that. This short term and long term straight up straight up.
[03:05:45] Tactical and strategic victory. Yeah. It's like, you know, the, you know, those combination
[03:05:51] ancient combination locks on those old school movies. I don't know. Indian and jumped out.
[03:05:56] I don't know. I want to be steel. Actually, but it's impossible to do. It's actually not an Indian
[03:06:00] and it's, I don't think. Maybe it is. Either way, it's like that. If you figured out the combination,
[03:06:05] it's the same. Yeah. That's a short term and a long term and it's healthy and it tastes good.
[03:06:11] Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Incredible metaphor. Also speaking of tasting good,
[03:06:17] we've got some additional protein supplementation called milk. I've been on that. I've been on the
[03:06:21] train this past week. I have been to actually. Hey, is this a, is it a violation? And I always
[03:06:27] have been actually looking at how, I guess I got a sweet. I got a sweet tooth. Okay, is this
[03:06:32] violation? Let me put it to the other. You, I don't think you've done this, but this may have been done
[03:06:38] from other people other than just me put dark chocolate chips in the milk. Right. Come on.
[03:06:45] Yeah. I, no, I haven't done that. But I've done probably something equally. What is it? Is
[03:06:51] this a violation? Do you think? Yeah, that's the question. Yeah. I don't think it's a violation,
[03:06:54] but I have put ice cream straight up into my milk. Yeah. We'll say it's not a violation, but you're
[03:07:01] pushing it. Here's the thing. I did it. I was like, okay, it wasn't worth it. Yeah, it kind of,
[03:07:06] yeah, the, it has a, oh, it's going to be a no. No. Yeah. The reason for milk is because it already tastes
[03:07:11] like dessert. It's like, can you have something, can dessert taste more like dessert? No, really,
[03:07:17] you might opinion. Yes, like, like, I don't know if you like Rocky root ice cream, but let's say
[03:07:21] you know, I'm a marshmallow. I'm going to, okay, all right, cool. I dig it then, but what if let's say
[03:07:26] you know, it's more is no marshmallow is no. However, lucky charms back in the
[03:07:31] world. It's a joke with this eating the freaking mushrooms. I love the lucky charms. Yeah, that guy,
[03:07:37] bro. You know, I take the milk and what I do is I mix water with it and I put it in a bowl
[03:07:43] in the morning and I'll mix water with it and then I'll like make a pudding out of it and I'll put it in
[03:07:47] the, uh, I just I do it first thing in the morning and then I'll put it in their refrigerator
[03:07:51] and then when I come home in the evening, I eat it like that. Oh, it's like pudding. Pudding.
[03:07:56] It's interesting. Hey, so if you're just telling me those right now. So basically, you just like,
[03:08:00] you can't put too much water. So you just put it like you just put like a little bit of water in there
[03:08:04] and then see if it mixes it up and if you need just a little bit more, you put it in there until it's
[03:08:07] basically like a like mud like mud and then you stick it in there for a generator and it is
[03:08:15] listen, well, I'm afraid of you. We'll flavor you do. Well, so I, I like, I may have loved the pumpkin.
[03:08:21] I'm just, yeah. The pumpkin is like, it's like pumpkin pie. He just looked like an addict when he said that.
[03:08:27] Ah, he's like, I like the pumpkin. We talked about the toe, the DNT toe at earlier. You look more
[03:08:33] exciting about the pumpkin. Oh, yeah. You gotta get on the pumpkin. You gotta get on the pumpkin.
[03:08:38] That does make sense though because if I don't add enough, whether being milk,
[03:08:42] you know when you make it in the blender the normal way. If I put a little bit of peanut butter in it,
[03:08:47] though sometimes. So I've even the peanut butter flavor. Yes, okay. Sometimes. You're going to
[03:08:52] O D on peanut butter, but it's all because it's very possible. But there had been times where I didn't
[03:08:56] put enough milk or I put too many scoops in there. And yeah, after I blended it up, it was like,
[03:09:01] oh, this is kind of like almost like a pudding. Now you need to throw it in the fridge. So,
[03:09:05] don't let the fridge in the fridge. Oh, it's listen, you'll call me after you do that. And we'll say,
[03:09:11] thank you. You'll freeze B to the quota. So, boom, again, another short term long term payoff
[03:09:18] situation right there. It's a good strategic victory. Yes, sir. Yes. So, yes, go to
[03:09:24] soccer field. That's where you can get all this stuff. Chocolatefield.com. Vitamin shop. You can get
[03:09:27] a vitamin shop too. Oh, yes. If you need to get it. Oh, local. Yeah, I'm also this. Another cool
[03:09:32] supplements on there. Vitamin D 3. Join the word for a superkilled oil for your joint. We don't want
[03:09:37] to worry about that kind of stuff. We don't want to worry about getting sick. No. You're immune
[03:09:41] system. We're about that. And you just worry about your immune system. Give it vitamin D 3. You don't worry
[03:09:46] about that. It's nothing more. That's my point. You feel me seeing what you see them saying. Anyway,
[03:09:50] you can get this stuff also at origin. USA.com. Yeah. It's a lot of stuff on origin. USA.com
[03:09:57] by the way, aside from chocolate fuel supplements. Cheers. American made. Geese. Geese.
[03:10:04] Geese. Rashcards. Rashcards. Or other purposes. What do you use a rash card for?
[03:10:12] So, I'm out of, I'm using a wire rash card, but I wear those shorts as underwear. Oh, dang. Let me tell you
[03:10:18] something. Which ones? Yeah. The, I mean, the one that's like the actual underwear. Oh, not those.
[03:10:27] No. The ones like have the the constitution on them. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:10:34] Do you just have to? Or this? Yeah. Those are, well, yeah. Those are those are those are supposed
[03:10:37] to be underwear, bro. Oh, so you're actually using them in the correct manner. Yeah. Where
[03:10:41] underwear is underwear, what happens when you roll it? What happens when you roll it on without
[03:10:46] underwear? Oh, that's the stretch. Really? Yeah. Okay. Hey, the club. I don't know.
[03:10:54] He's with you. I'm going to come roll with you, mind. Where? Bro, Dean, let's
[03:10:59] start your business. Yeah. Yeah. He's the man. So yeah, that's great. I'm glad he's the man.
[03:11:04] Here's the deal. Like in the early G. J. J. J. J. J. There was like this thing in Brazil, where they
[03:11:09] would wear like, it's called a song. It's called a sungong. And then there's a long, a longer one
[03:11:15] is called a sungong. But a shorter one's called like a sungonger. It's basically a freaking pair of
[03:11:19] speedos. And Dean had something like that sort of like in between the two. But they're freaking
[03:11:25] basically hot pants. Yeah. I mean, it's basically a speedo. And he'd roll with me, you know.
[03:11:33] And like, you know, I'm going to see if I can get a pair. And I just are freaking nightmare.
[03:11:39] And I'm glad that those things went out of style. How is it past in the guard?
[03:11:44] Dude, it's just all adventure. It's, say what? It's not as bad as North South. I'll tell you that.
[03:11:50] It's a freaking nightmare. Like you want to talk about PTSD, bro. Probably better. I got freaking
[03:11:57] a damn animal male animal in a pair of white, tidy whiteies freaking all up on me. North South
[03:12:05] them on top. Either way, bro. But at least, at least if I'm on top, I can maneuver. And I'm going
[03:12:11] on, I'm going, cross-eyed, neon belly. I might even just run away.
[03:12:19] Nightmares. I need eye-begined freaking recover from that. And then to be smart. Well, yeah, I think you're
[03:12:26] right about that. By the way. Also, and origin-me, we got some American-made denim jeans, boots, boom.

[03:14:20] I'm out. Yes, different. It's different. It's different. It's hard to connect with them. I've done
[03:14:25] a couple of them. Not for this one. We're trying to maintain the live situations. I've done a
[03:14:30] bunch of zoom. And look, it's zoom is zoom is real close. It's depending on what you're going to talk
[03:14:35] about. If people are just going to talk about, you know, whatever or some whatever, like not totally
[03:14:42] surface topics. But if you're not going deep, you know, we're good. Yeah, I'll do zoom. If you're
[03:14:48] if you're doing an interview like a maybe a standard for lack of better term interview like,
[03:14:52] hey, this is going on. What do you feel about this? The code of mine. Then we wait for the
[03:14:56] code of mine to answer. Oh yeah. Yeah. But it's hard to have a conversation. Exactly. Right.
[03:15:02] So check out that podcast from Dakota. Also, you can subscribe to this podcast if you want.
[03:15:08] And Echo used to seem to think that there was a lot of people that were like purposely not
[03:15:13] subscribing.
[03:15:13] Oh, the look on your face when I when I was growing, when I put thoughts into your head. Yeah.
[03:15:22] And you know, I've I've tried to do it. You look so puzzled because you look like you you trust me.
[03:15:27] And so you go look on your face like wait, did I really do that? No. Okay.
[03:15:31] Anyways, let me try to recall when I said you do that in front of trust me. You trust me that I'm that I'm not
[03:15:37] sitting here just making things up which I just did. Yeah. So I could never say that trust me. Trust me.
[03:15:42] It's broken. No, no.
[03:15:44] If you want to subscribe to this podcast, go ahead and do a leave a review or whatever.
[03:15:49] Also, I have a jockel unraveling podcast with Darryl Cooper.
[03:15:52] New one just came out. They're they're freaking.
[03:15:58] It's a good place to learn grounded podcast about you. It's a warrior kid podcast. Some new episodes
[03:16:02] just dropped. So you can check that out. If you want, we also have the jockel
[03:16:07] underground dot com, which is another it's it's look what it is. It's a way for us to build a
[03:16:16] network that we don't have to rely on anybody else. We don't have to rely on it. It's platforms. We don't
[03:16:19] have to rely on any advertising. Nothing like that. So if you want to help out, you want to support
[03:16:24] you can go to jockel on a round dot com. You can join that. And as a as a thank you, we do another
[03:16:31] freaking podcast and answer questions. I'm going to be a now I'm starting to cover a little topics.
[03:16:36] Yeah. Little topics. Little topics to give people some perspective because because
[03:16:44] not everything is a jockel podcast, right? There's a certain you first of all, you can have a
[03:16:49] jockel podcast. Really, that's like 18 minutes long. Yeah. You could, but it wouldn't be what people
[03:16:56] are expecting. And normally we don't like to do that. So we made this other podcast talking about
[03:17:01] different topics, educational topics, life topics. It's not all about to do with war and all that stuff.
[03:17:08] It's not all all leadership, but but it of course it does include those things as well. So anyways,
[03:17:13] if you want to check that out, how's this for a topic? You know, in your opinion, this might
[03:17:17] pre-liminary thought. I think I might have sent it to you. I might not have the fight to use to get into
[03:17:22] you. Not like as an adult, but you know, like as a kid, you know, like you could into like your first
[03:17:28] fight. Like what was that? Oh yeah. And then go up through high school. I mean, I don't know. I'm not going
[03:17:33] to put, I don't know what your actual experiences, but I thought of it because I was talking with
[03:17:38] my wife and she reminded me of something that I said it and that she was like, oh, you're this bad
[03:17:42] kid. And then I'm like, yeah, well, when you condense all the fights I ever got in in my life,
[03:17:47] kind of seem like I was this bad kid. But it was kind of interesting to kind of go
[03:17:51] through those in like debris. Compare. Yeah, it's like you compare your mindset, like as a kid
[03:17:57] and then versus as an adult. Yeah, I got some, yeah, that's interesting. That's literally the
[03:18:03] next thought I had was like, I wonder if like, because you know how you you've went through like some
[03:18:08] stuff, you know, with especially in the hardcore scene and all this stuff. And then it's like, it's a
[03:18:13] different, that's a different community. We'll say, yeah, yeah, it's weird to look back at those days.
[03:18:18] It's very strange to look back at those days now. Yeah, very strange. So it's like, yeah, that'd be
[03:18:23] really interesting. Because it's just a different like what you were saying earlier, Dakota about being
[03:18:28] just younger. Yeah. I mean, when I was like 15, like my whole partially developed brain
[03:18:37] filled with testosterone and rage. Yeah. Yeah. We got some interesting topics on there. If you want to
[03:18:45] up, it costs money $8.18 a month. Again, this is how we're building a contingency plan in case
[03:18:51] things go sideways. We'll still have a way to get this information out. If you can't afford that,
[03:18:56] it's all good. We got you just email assistance at underground at jockel underground.com.
[03:19:02] And we'll hook it up. We got a YouTube channel. Yeah. It's official. official. It's called
[03:19:09] jockel podcast. Is that what it's called? It's called jockel podcast. And the good videos on there.
[03:19:15] I am the assistant director of. Okay. So you can check those out. A origin also origin has a little
[03:19:21] has a channel HD, a little HD that they put out. If you want to know what's happening up at origin,
[03:19:26] as we rebuild America. And let's say what pretty soon, it looks like it could be also
[03:19:32] if you want to see what's going on down there with origin. Because we want to be expanding
[03:19:36] in small other states, some other opportunities are out there. So we can tell you to bring back
[03:19:41] manufacturer, not just a main, not just a New England, but to America at large, which is what
[03:19:47] we're looking to do. Yeah. True. Also, psychological warfare is an album that we put out a few
[03:19:52] years ago, by the way. Still doing well. What it does is what you do is you listen to these tracks
[03:19:57] of jockel letting you know how to get past these moments of weakness if they come about.
[03:20:03] We work. We work. They will from time to time for sure. And if you might want a visual representation
[03:20:09] of maybe how to overcome some weakness, you can go to flipsidecampus.com. Try it.

[03:20:40] Hey, Dakota has a company here. We talk about every episode, flipsidecampus.com. Where did you
[03:20:47] come up with the name flipside? You know, the last thing that my, the kind of fix said to me,
[03:20:54] when he kicked off that morning, he said, uh, my I'll see you on the flipside. And, um,
[03:21:00] that's for the name came from, you know, flipsidecampus, just trying to do another little part of
[03:21:06] changing the world, the same thing that he stepped off to do that day. And, um, yeah, that's where
[03:21:11] it comes from to motivate to be able to inspire people, you know. Um, you know, I figured out like
[03:21:16] when we look at something, you know, when we, when we view something, it makes us feel a certain way.
[03:21:21] It's connected, you know, our eyes are connected right to our soul. And then, um, you know,
[03:21:26] so that's where the art came from of like, how do we put things out to where people see this and
[03:21:31] feel something that inspires them? And that's, that's where flipside comes from. And also on top of
[03:21:37] all that, once again, bringing manufacturing back to America, because it's all made America,
