Because you know, I mean, even in everyday person, if they, they do something kind of hard or work out or even, you know, something like people will recreation and be like, I think going around a marathon or something like that. Like one of the things that that separate, like what when I worked with you that first time, and I saw you like being humble, I was like, man, that's that to me is the characteristic that you can tell the guy is not just a good team guy, but an awesome team guy when he's humble about what's going on. I mean, there's just, you know, if I don't get to people back home's name, I'm sorry, but, you know, I got really good friends that that tried to help me kind of, but they just have no idea, like, you know, there's one old team guy back there. But some people like just insane skydivers, some guys are just phenomenal rock climbers, some guys are just like swimming, sons of guns, you know, or runners and wrestlers and fistfighters and there's, you know, some people just in the guns. Like, like I remember, you know, I remember getting like three briefs about some guy that I was getting in a platoon about where this guy got lost. You know, like if you, I mean, even like you'll hear about a guy that gets lost in buzz in and you or like gets lost going through the initial training. Yeah, so eight, you know what's interesting too, like we talked about points, you know, but the guys like all of our guys are AW gunners put sights put the eight cogs on there on there. But even even overall above and beyond just the water situation where, and you're like this tool that we're kind of talking about this where, do you think that, you know, like if you just sit around indoors and after all, you're like, bro, I gotta get out. Oh, like people like, like look, my cool scar, you know, that kind of thing. You know, he's like, well, I wish I could, you know, conceal weapon carry, you know, it's got, say I got my revolver So if someone was like, hey, you know, that guy's a really good shot and then someone immediately, but you know, you ever, you don't know how to swim though. Like, like, like, I, I freely admit, like, I don't sleep a lot, right? There's little things, but overall, you know, I didn't have to like, figure out, figure out like a woman and, you know, it was all wishy, washy, about shit and stuff. Because if you lead by example and you're humble and you're good to your guys and you know, you're guys and you know your guys and you let them know you. You know, I, I don't, I guess I could have been more like a nice whatever, but I'm like, man, you look like you're fucking fat. I feel like just like how you were saying, I think, you know, a few weeks ago, you were like, There is, there is a word for it. And it wasn't like a big difference, but you know, a normal person has a 26% chance of making it through and someone from New England had like a 37 or something like a small uptick. I was like, hmm, I, you know, so that was like, yeah, that was like my praise. I mean, everybody's got to know that man, you know, I, I don't want, like, my favorite thing is I go out on an operation with you guys and not do anything. You know, even, even stuff like the weather, you know, talk it, you know, all of a sudden, a snowing. But, but, you know, a lot of people, so if you're listening and you're wondering, you know, what makes, what makes somebody a good, like a good NCO and it was a lot of Marines, a lot of soldiers listen to this. And I know that, you know, like I always trust, you guys are going to do the right thing. Like, a lot of people, like some people, they can be big, well, they can run, you know, 10 miles, no problem all this stuff, but they get in certain kind of discomfort physically or whatever they're done. He was like, oh, yeah, no, like, like just guys that were so, so fired up that, yeah. Then like, you know, the guys who showed up later, whatever they're still kind of like, hey, you want all kicked out of the ladies. And so that kind of trained us like being hung over and stuff like, I mean, we would be like, hung over and go work I mean, especially like the sister's kids, those guys were, you know, we had the new guys, we had the older guys, and then we had the middle guys. Actually, I actually remember you were briefing some of the guys when we were back and you were like, um, you were like, hey, you know what? You know, I got some good families back there, you know, that helped me out, like, friends of mine, friends of my family. You know, in the bottom line is I'm not coming down and going, I'm not coming down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down and going down. And like, if we can just slow down a little bit, you know, I'm like, okay, I mean, what's your limit, bitch? But when the shit hits the fan, you know, it's, it's strange because it makes me, like, a little bit like a little calmer, I think. Yeah, like, just not the other way for those of you out there like, oh, he like didn't do his job. It's no fun being a team guy when you're 44, you know, and you get up and you're like, I'm like, I better retire. And you know how, like, after around this done, like a lot of people, and I was one of those people. And you know, actually when I told people that you're coming on the show, you know, people actually know who you are from the Liftetel. You know, I figured if this, I have a pretty good chance to stay out of the clinic, you know, this way, but not always, but a few times, you know. You know, this guy and I was like, you know, is he, is he good to go?
