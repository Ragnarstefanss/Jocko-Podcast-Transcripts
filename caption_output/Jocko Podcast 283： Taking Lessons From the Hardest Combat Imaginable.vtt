00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.02
This is Jockel podcast number 283 with echo Charles and me. Jockel willing good evening echo.

2
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:08.02
Good evening.

3
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:14.80
Jumping into combat lessons. We've done some combat lessons before. We've done volumes

4
00:00:14.80 --> 00:00:20.56
one two and three on this podcast. I'm skipping ahead a little bit to volume seven.

5
00:00:20.56 --> 00:00:26.96
There's a section here that I kind of got kind of got into. These combat lessons were written

6
00:00:26.96 --> 00:00:34.56
during World War II with the explicit intention of disseminating lessons learned rapidly

7
00:00:34.56 --> 00:00:41.84
back to the troops to keep more guys alive and kill more enemy. And you might think

8
00:00:41.84 --> 00:00:46.80
and I started thinking like why am I reviewing these? Why am I reviewing number four?

9
00:00:46.80 --> 00:00:51.44
Why am I doing that? I'll tell you why. Because I've never heard these lessons before.

10
00:00:51.44 --> 00:00:58.16
Think about that. I was in the military for 20 years and I never heard these lessons before.

11
00:00:58.96 --> 00:01:03.76
There's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with that. These guys,

12
00:01:03.76 --> 00:01:08.80
these are lessons written in blood in the hardest combat imaginable.

13
00:01:10.88 --> 00:01:15.68
And they're not in the past on. So I want to make sure I pass on these lessons. And you know what?

14
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:21.68
Obviously, they're not just for combat. Not just for combat. You're going to see the translation

15
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:25.60
to every situation that a human being and a leadership position can be in.

16
00:01:28.88 --> 00:01:35.52
So combat lessons. The volumes are getting better. So the first one was kind of like a little

17
00:01:35.52 --> 00:01:40.64
bit. I'm not going to say it was half-hazardly put together. But now you got the full

18
00:01:40.64 --> 00:01:46.000
cover picture. You know, they're if you're looking at this on YouTube, you got the cover picture up.

19
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.72
They're combat lessons. Combat lessons number seven, rank and file and combat. What they do,

20
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:58.64
what they are doing and how they do it. The intro to this thing, to this book, comes from,

21
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.40
I'll just read it. Our armies in Europe have won their victory. So this is late in the war.

22
00:02:05.28 --> 00:02:08.88
Victory in Europe already. So now we're just fighting in the Pacific theater.

23
00:02:08.88 --> 00:02:13.44
Veterans of the campaigns of North Africa and Europe are now joining forces with the veterans of

24
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:19.52
the Pacific for the final assault against Japan. Can you imagine having that on the horizon?

25
00:02:21.12 --> 00:02:29.68
You're thinking, okay, we're going final assault on Japan on the Japanese Empire. We're going

26
00:02:29.68 --> 00:02:32.72
to kill all of them because they fight to the death. That's what's about to happen.

27
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.08
They don't, they don't know anything about the atomic bomb yet. That's not even an option.

28
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:44.16
They've seen the Japanese fight to the death on island after island. And now they're going to go

29
00:02:44.16 --> 00:02:51.12
and assault the Japanese island itself. The island of Japan. Back to the book, they are coming

30
00:02:51.12 --> 00:02:56.08
to grips with a folk quite different from the German soldier, different as an individual fighting

31
00:02:56.08 --> 00:03:02.16
man and different in the tactics employed. Even the most experienced soldier of the European battlefields

32
00:03:02.16 --> 00:03:09.04
will have much to learn. Humility. You imagine you get done with Normandy, the D-Day, the Battle

33
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:12.72
of the Bulge and you show up in the Pacific theater. You got a lot to learn, kid.

34
00:03:14.64 --> 00:03:20.48
Dang. We must now bring to bear against the Japanese all the experience we have gained in every

35
00:03:20.48 --> 00:03:26.88
theater. The suggestions made in combat lessons are drawn from such expert experience. Since to be

36
00:03:26.88 --> 00:03:32.40
effective, they must reach the soldier promptly. Publication is not delayed to ensure that they

37
00:03:32.40 --> 00:03:38.96
always represent the thoroughly digested views of the war department. The great combat lesson

38
00:03:38.96 --> 00:03:46.16
learned from every operation is the importance of leadership. Our equipment, our supply and above

39
00:03:46.16 --> 00:03:55.12
our men are splendid. Aggressive and determined leadership is the priceless factor which inspires

40
00:03:55.12 --> 00:04:04.56
a command and upon which success all success in battle depends. It is responsible for success or failure.

41
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:08.56
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. By the way, signed by General Marshall,

42
00:04:09.44 --> 00:04:18.24
five star general. Three, no, four, no, five star general. Churchill called General Marshall,

43
00:04:18.24 --> 00:04:24.56
the organizer of victory. The organizer of victory of World War II. Let's think about that. That's

44
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:30.16
a pretty good compliment coming from Churchill. This is a guy that was a platoon in a company commander

45
00:04:30.16 --> 00:04:36.88
in the Philippine war. Ended up being a secretary state. Remember to learn about the Marshall

46
00:04:36.88 --> 00:04:41.84
plan? Well, when you were in high school at some point you learned about the Marshall plan. You

47
00:04:41.84 --> 00:04:48.32
just don't remember it. It was like the World War II. It was the recovery. The rebuilding

48
00:04:48.32 --> 00:04:55.12
after World War II oversees in Europe that the Marshall plan named after this guy. He got a no

49
00:04:55.12 --> 00:05:01.68
bell piece for us for that. By the way, a very capable man. So kicking it into the book here,

50
00:05:02.48 --> 00:05:08.64
leadership. First section, leadership. Too much stress cannot be placed upon the necessity for

51
00:05:08.64 --> 00:05:16.16
developing intelligent aggressive troop leaders in all echelons. So says General Omar Bradley

52
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:23.92
Commander of the 12th Army Group. I want to say that again, too much stress cannot be placed.

53
00:05:23.92 --> 00:05:30.56
There's no way you can stress the necessity for developing intelligent aggressive troop leaders

54
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.92
and where in all echelons, in all echelons, squad leaders. However, to use the battlefield as a

55
00:05:41.92 --> 00:05:46.88
school room for the training of leaders is to sacrifice needlessly the lives of our men, the habit

56
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:52.08
of command and the technique of troop leading must be learned thoroughly by all leaders prior to

57
00:05:52.08 --> 00:06:00.08
entry in combat. Not only must leaders learn their own jobs thoroughly, but they must also be given

58
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:07.12
ample opportunity to operate in the command capacity of the next higher echelon in order that

59
00:06:07.12 --> 00:06:12.16
qualified replacements will be available. So if you're running a business, I said there's some

60
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:15.60
similarities. If you're running a business and you're not investing in your leadership, you're wrong.

61
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:21.68
And throwing them out to the wolves, throwing them out to the clients, throw them out to a building

62
00:06:21.68 --> 00:06:27.04
site without any training and preparation or without any mentorship while they're out there is the wrong

63
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:36.08
move. By the way, that's why echelon front actually exists. That's why we exist to help that process

64
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:42.64
take place. The junior leaders responsibility, field leaders constantly emphasize the need for junior

65
00:06:42.64 --> 00:06:48.40
officers who will share the responsibilities of their superiors and take charge when emergencies arise

66
00:06:48.40 --> 00:06:57.92
in battle. Check this out. Here's a note. You're young. You're new to the company. You're inexperienced

67
00:06:57.92 --> 00:07:05.92
in some way or another way. If you have the willingness to pay attention and then start taking

68
00:07:05.92 --> 00:07:11.68
responsibility and start taking ownership of things, you will go places. Now look, you got to be,

69
00:07:11.68 --> 00:07:17.68
you don't want to go overboard with it. But if you see your boss has got some things that maybe

70
00:07:17.68 --> 00:07:25.20
you could take over for, take them over. Have a question. Go. But extreme ownership and this

71
00:07:25.20 --> 00:07:31.92
might be splitting hairs, but in the spirit of understanding. So let's say whatever you come to me

72
00:07:33.12 --> 00:07:43.04
and or whatever. I'm taking ownership of a mistake that happened. What if I do, I am like,

73
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:50.16
I'm not blaming you, but I am defensive. I am whatever. I am all that, but I actually do at the end of

74
00:07:50.16 --> 00:07:57.92
the lecture or whatever. I do want to, at the end of the day, I do think that the mistake was my

75
00:07:57.92 --> 00:08:04.80
fall 100% and I'm going to take it upon myself to fix the mistake. But I handled the initial

76
00:08:04.80 --> 00:08:13.36
lecture wrong. Is that still technically extreme ownership? Why am I lecturing you? I don't know.

77
00:08:13.36 --> 00:08:18.80
Like a, you know, I messed up the project. Okay, you know, failed the project. And then

78
00:08:18.80 --> 00:08:23.68
I come to you and say, hey, echo, it looks like we're not going to get this project done on time.

79
00:08:23.68 --> 00:08:28.72
Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Like, or let's say we straight up didn't fail. Okay. Oh,

80
00:08:29.12 --> 00:08:36.000
echo, I see that we failed to get this project done. Yeah. Did you get the support that you

81
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.44
need? Is there anything that I should have done a better job up to make sure you had what you need

82
00:08:39.44 --> 00:08:42.64
to get this thing done? Because this is a big let down for the client. Yeah. And this is in the

83
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:48.72
kind of reputation we're looking to have. Where did I let you down? Okay. So that's a you take

84
00:08:48.72 --> 00:08:53.92
ownership, right? Extreme, you know, and you're like, okay. So what if instead of that good

85
00:08:53.92 --> 00:08:58.64
lecture, you were like, hey, you messed up and you, you know, like you did this in a go.

86
00:08:58.64 --> 00:09:03.20
Yeah, go. You failed this project. That's pathetic. I'm thinking about maybe

87
00:09:03.20 --> 00:09:08.32
demoting you. Yeah. And then let's say, okay, after you lecture me, you think in your head,

88
00:09:08.32 --> 00:09:13.12
you know what? This is my fault. This actually is my fault. And I'm going to do everything I can

89
00:09:13.12 --> 00:09:19.60
to to correct this. You do after you lecture me the law with you, but then I realize I'm wrong. Yes.

90
00:09:19.60 --> 00:09:22.64
And then I said, you know what? There's some things I could have problems with. No, you don't say

91
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:27.44
that part. Okay. You don't say nothing to me. You just kind of at you. Basically the whole thing

92
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:31.20
you learned the lesson. You failed the first part, but it's like, you know, you do the

93
00:09:31.20 --> 00:09:37.60
car. You failed the first one, but you succeed in the second one. Okay. But then I opt

94
00:09:37.60 --> 00:09:43.52
not to take ownership for some reason. With your verbal, it's a wrong idea. You can see where

95
00:09:43.52 --> 00:09:48.72
you can see where this is. What's interesting about these questions that you're trying to formulate

96
00:09:49.68 --> 00:09:55.12
is how quickly they dissipate when the person legitimately takes ownership. Right. All, like when I

97
00:09:55.12 --> 00:09:58.80
said, okay, so I say to you, hey, echo, where did I not support you? All of a sudden, you didn't even

98
00:09:58.80 --> 00:10:02.32
have an argument. You didn't have a question anymore. It was gone. You had to get me to say thing

99
00:10:02.32 --> 00:10:08.40
wrong to you. Yes. And then you want me to like switch halfway because I'm just a crazy person.

100
00:10:09.36 --> 00:10:14.08
So that's what we're at right now. Which is fine. Okay. So what's the hypothetical point that we're

101
00:10:14.08 --> 00:10:20.08
trying to get out? Well, I guess if I if I learned anything from you right now and in the past,

102
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:25.84
it is that if you're going to take ownership extreme, well, if you're going to demonstrate that

103
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:32.80
practice that, there's two parts of it and that's sort of it. There's two parts of it. You the way you

104
00:10:32.80 --> 00:10:37.28
come at the person or whatever, you let them know that it's your fault kind of thing. And then the second

105
00:10:37.28 --> 00:10:42.64
part is you for real, it is your fault in your mind. It is. It is your responsibility to take action

106
00:10:42.64 --> 00:10:47.84
to fix those problems. Not the kind of one that's in your question is when I come at you and say,

107
00:10:47.84 --> 00:10:52.08
you failed this project, you go, well, you're a big project. So you get defensive at first, right?

108
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:57.52
Yes, because you take it the wrong way. And you don't remember to take ownership for another two minutes.

109
00:10:57.52 --> 00:11:03.60
The whole thing, the whole time you forget to take ownership and the last two minutes, you know what you do?

110
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:09.92
You go, you know what, you know what boss, I'm getting defensive because my ego is getting in the way.

111
00:11:09.92 --> 00:11:14.80
And this is actually my fault. And all these excuses that I'm making right now make no sense whatsoever.

112
00:11:14.80 --> 00:11:19.20
Here's the mistakes I made. Here's the things I'm going to do to fix it. I will not let this happen again.

113
00:11:19.20 --> 00:11:25.28
Yeah, I'll get all myself. Yeah. So without that second recovery part, I'm talking about the interaction between the two people.

114
00:11:25.28 --> 00:11:31.28
Mm-hmm. That alone not that subsequent actions that you're going to take to solve the problem. I'm not talking about that because you're going to do that anyway.

115
00:11:31.28 --> 00:11:40.16
Yeah. But that second verbal part interaction part without that that technically does not fit. Does not fulfill the formula of extreme ownership.

116
00:11:40.16 --> 00:11:46.24
What do you mean without that second part? Which second part? The part where you're, where you explain to the person that you have the interaction with?

117
00:11:46.24 --> 00:11:50.08
Like, all of that was my fault. And my ego's getting away. Like not that part.

118
00:11:50.08 --> 00:11:56.08
Straight up, you left the meeting straight up like we got scolded. Oh, whatever. Then, and then you say,

119
00:11:56.08 --> 00:11:59.28
this wasn't my fault and you leave. Yeah. Yeah. You have to take ownership of that.

120
00:11:59.28 --> 00:12:02.96
That's the point of extreme ownership. Right in your mind, you're like, wait, it is my fault.

121
00:12:02.96 --> 00:12:05.36
Yeah, then you go back and then you say, hey, this is, that's what I'm saying.

122
00:12:05.36 --> 00:12:09.76
Okay, you do that. The interaction is part of the, yes. Yes, it is.

123
00:12:09.76 --> 00:12:14.88
You have to, I mean, otherwise you're just making excuses and blame another people. And I don't trust you by the way.

124
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:17.76
Yeah. I'm like, oh, echo screwed this up, but he isn't even realized that he screws up.

125
00:12:17.76 --> 00:12:21.68
He thinks it's a devil and else is fault. He doesn't take ownership. Cool. I'm never given him another project again.

126
00:12:22.64 --> 00:12:26.16
Whereas you come back and he said, you know what, boss, this is, this is completely my fault.

127
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:29.76
And then I let my ego get in the way. And I got mad. My temper and my ego.

128
00:12:30.48 --> 00:12:32.80
I will not let that happen again. Boom.

129
00:12:33.92 --> 00:12:36.40
Problem solved. I understand. Check.

130
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:39.52
All right. Moving on.

131
00:12:39.52 --> 00:12:47.20
Comments, major general John P. Lucas commander of six core. Prior to battle, we must develop the feeling of

132
00:12:47.20 --> 00:12:52.56
responsibility and junior officers and non-commissioned officers develop the feeling of responsibility.

133
00:12:52.56 --> 00:12:59.68
We want to give them ownership. I suggest doing this during field exercises by suddenly an

134
00:12:59.68 --> 00:13:06.08
and unexpectedly declaring the commander a casualty and placing the second in command in charge.

135
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:10.64
Something did all the time in seal training. Oh, got a good platoon commander. He's doing a great job. Cool.

136
00:13:10.64 --> 00:13:13.84
You're down. Oh, platoon chiefs doing a super job. Cool. You're down.

137
00:13:15.52 --> 00:13:20.08
But commanding officer of the 119th Infantry in Germany makes this statement in battle. Nothing is

138
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:26.08
more important than having leaders who will share their commanders responsibility for the accomplishment

139
00:13:26.08 --> 00:13:31.04
of the mission. Again, if you're a junior person out there, if you're joining an organization or

140
00:13:31.04 --> 00:13:35.76
you're a mid-level manager, if you can be a person that starts to take ownership of things

141
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:42.64
and starts to take pressure and jobs and tasks and responsibilities off your bosses play,

142
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:50.56
they are going to love you. Nothing more important. He says. Nothing more important than having

143
00:13:50.56 --> 00:13:55.60
leaders that will take their share of the commanders of responsibility. One of the most difficult

144
00:13:55.60 --> 00:14:03.36
tasks for the junior leader is getting the men to move forward under fire. Issuing the orders is

145
00:14:03.36 --> 00:14:09.76
easy, but seeing that the orders are carried out may call for every ounce of energy and initiative

146
00:14:09.76 --> 00:14:18.32
the officer or NCO possesses. Issuing the orders is easy. That's easy, Bart. I think Paton said

147
00:14:18.32 --> 00:14:28.24
10% of the job is issuing orders. 90% is getting them done. Responsible leadership in actions

148
00:14:28.24 --> 00:14:35.20
the next section. Captain Souter was at his command post CP when a soldier came into report that

149
00:14:35.20 --> 00:14:40.96
two wiremen had been wounded by an enemy sniper about 500 yards away. He immediately took four men

150
00:14:40.96 --> 00:14:46.16
and set out to assist the wounded men. Before arriving at their goal, the captain and his men

151
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:52.72
observed a group of wiremen pinned down in an open field by enemy machine gun fire. Captain Souter

152
00:14:52.72 --> 00:14:57.52
spotted the enemy machine gun and ordered his men to cover positions but himself took an

153
00:14:57.52 --> 00:15:02.000
exposed position from which he could fire upon the machine gun. He opened fire suddenly and killed

154
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.28
six of the enemy crew making it possible for the wounded men to be evacuated in safety and for the

155
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:12.56
wiremen to continue their work. By that time, Captain Souter had observed more serious trouble

156
00:15:12.56 --> 00:15:17.60
in the vicinity. An enemy armored car was part-beside a building some distance away.

157
00:15:18.40 --> 00:15:23.20
The captain knew that part of another advancing regiment was in the sector covered by the enemy

158
00:15:23.20 --> 00:15:28.24
vehicle. He immediately sent back for a 50 caliber machine gun at the command post and for two

159
00:15:28.24 --> 00:15:33.68
tanks to cover the oncoming regiment during its approach. While waiting for these reinforcements he

160
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:39.12
collected a few of his men and resumed fire on the enemy with the result that many were forced to

161
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:44.88
flee an 18 enemy were wounded. While this was going on, Captain Souter was informed that all officers

162
00:15:44.88 --> 00:15:49.68
of one company with the approaching regiment had become casualties. He immediately took charge

163
00:15:49.68 --> 00:15:56.16
and reorganized the company so at the when the other officers came up, the unit was well dispersed

164
00:15:56.16 --> 00:16:02.40
and under control. He then gave first aid to the wounded officer officers and saw that they were

165
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:07.92
evacuated to a safer location for further care. The tanks arrived in time to assist the other

166
00:16:07.92 --> 00:16:12.32
regiments assault on the enemy positions and the objective was successfully taken. Had it not been

167
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:17.28
for Captain Souter's timely and decisive actions, casualties among our men would have been extremely

168
00:16:17.28 --> 00:16:22.80
heavy and the attainment of the objective questionable. First contribution in this emergency,

169
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:24.80
Captain Souter was awarded the Silver Star.

170
00:16:26.88 --> 00:16:32.08
Initiative taking charge. I love this part where he got wounded as a company coming forward and

171
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:36.24
they're wounded officers so you disperse your company and you prepare to receive those guys

172
00:16:36.24 --> 00:16:45.68
and you're able to put him to work immediately. Responsible leadership as the soldier sees it.

173
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:50.32
Another final example of responsible and inspiring leadership is given in the following account

174
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:58.32
of the part played by Lieutenant William E. Everett, 101st Infantry, 36 Division A in action in

175
00:16:58.32 --> 00:17:04.16
Italy. This account was written by three of the enlisted men who served under him during that

176
00:17:04.16 --> 00:17:10.24
action. Our company led the attack on a hill and took it. The enemy counter attacked laying down heavy

177
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:16.32
artillery, mortar and machine gun fire that knocked out a large number of our men and every officer

178
00:17:16.32 --> 00:17:26.40
except Lieutenant Everett. Lieutenant Everett took over the difficult and dangerous job of keeping

179
00:17:26.40 --> 00:17:32.96
the company under control without any communications whatever. He had become so short of men

180
00:17:32.96 --> 00:17:37.84
that even the runners had to stay on the line fighting hard to help hold the ground we had won.

181
00:17:37.84 --> 00:17:44.48
At the time Lieutenant Everett took charge the enemy were coming up three sides of the hill

182
00:17:44.48 --> 00:17:49.52
and our men were in trouble. The Lieutenant ordered us to open fire with everything we had

183
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.84
while he took an exposed position on the side of the hill and called fire orders to our mortar.

184
00:17:55.84 --> 00:18:00.88
Our mortar finally stopped the advancing enemy. He then located an enemy mortar that had been

185
00:18:00.88 --> 00:18:05.92
giving us trouble all day and adjusted our mortar on it. Notking it out with a direct hit on the

186
00:18:05.92 --> 00:18:11.28
third ground. He personally eliminated two enemy snipers who had wounded several of our men.

187
00:18:11.28 --> 00:18:16.08
It was largely through his daring and determination that we were able to beat off the strong

188
00:18:16.08 --> 00:18:20.64
enemy counter attacks. For three days and four nights he risked his life by going from one

189
00:18:20.64 --> 00:18:25.76
platoon to another under enemy machine gun fire keeping the men under control and helping them

190
00:18:25.76 --> 00:18:31.60
meet each problem as it came. At times he himself helped carry the wounded to save for places.

191
00:18:31.60 --> 00:18:38.16
The Lieutenant was sick during all this fighting yet he never thought of his own discomfort but

192
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:42.88
stuck by the men who might have lost out if he had not been for his leadership.

193
00:18:49.12 --> 00:18:51.12
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

194
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:58.08
Next section discipline the first function of leadership.

195
00:18:58.08 --> 00:19:06.56
You know I'm happy and smiling when I see that. In the frequent discussions of battlefield

196
00:19:06.56 --> 00:19:11.44
leadership we are often prone to overlook the first function of leadership. The development of

197
00:19:11.44 --> 00:19:16.000
unit and individual discipline. The battle is the payoff.

198
00:19:17.68 --> 00:19:24.16
Said Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Ingersall and it is exactly that. The payoff on the leadership

199
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:30.80
which welded individuals into a smoothly functioning team. Discipline applies to all

200
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:37.68
Captain Jack Gary company commander of the 11th Infantry writes. Discipline is sometimes

201
00:19:37.68 --> 00:19:40.24
the determining factor between winning and losing.

202
00:19:42.80 --> 00:19:47.76
I once listened to a wounded officer back from fighting in Africa who said forget all the

203
00:19:47.76 --> 00:19:52.16
formalities in the field forget the officer and NCO distinctions in the field. Keep all the

204
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:57.36
eight balls they will fight like hell and I tried to look up this term eight balls and

205
00:19:58.08 --> 00:20:04.40
I assume it means like a like a rebel type guy. The reason I assume that is because the next sentence says

206
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:10.32
so that that was the guy quoting someone from Africa. He says I do not believe he had seen very

207
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:16.88
much action or he would not have made such a statement. I had a few quote eight balls who did

208
00:20:16.88 --> 00:20:22.32
fight like hell but I have also had a lot of men who never caused me trouble who were quiet,

209
00:20:22.32 --> 00:20:30.000
confident, well disciplined and these men fought much better. So you know you get that in case of

210
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.80
war, break glass thing where look this guy's little rough around the edges.

211
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:39.20
Yeah it seemed like when he was like I also had guys who were quite calm discipline whatever

212
00:20:39.20 --> 00:20:42.96
it just seemed like this eight ball phenomenon was the opposite of that. They're like the trouble

213
00:20:42.96 --> 00:20:47.92
makers. They're a little bit a little bit wild. Now look gotta have those guys too. We're going to need

214
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:54.48
those guys and they do have it. They can be awesome for sure because you gotta have a little bit of that.

215
00:20:55.60 --> 00:20:59.84
I mean let's face it if you're joining the military. If you're joining the military to

216
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:03.76
go into combat arms or you're joining the military to go in special operations you're going in

217
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:08.72
that you want to do something that's you basically want to do things that are not legal in the world.

218
00:21:08.72 --> 00:21:13.76
That's like you're going to kill people you're going to blow things up you're going to plant

219
00:21:13.76 --> 00:21:18.56
bombs that's what you're going to do. You can't really do that anywhere. Yes that's you know you're

220
00:21:18.56 --> 00:21:23.68
a kid and you're like what do I want to do when I grow up doctor. Boyer. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

221
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:30.64
Blow things up and kill people. That sounds like a good one. Right? That's not normal.

222
00:21:30.64 --> 00:21:31.84
And just an answer.

223
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:36.72
Had a conversation with a guy the other day and he was like telling me that

224
00:21:36.72 --> 00:21:40.80
he was having a conversation with a guy that was a seal and he's like, you know there's

225
00:21:40.80 --> 00:21:45.84
something that made me nervous. Because when this guy was a young seal he said you know I

226
00:21:46.24 --> 00:21:50.56
I was asking him, you know you you think you're ready to kill people and you know you're

227
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:54.48
going to deploy and this was kind of as Iraq was going on and this was like a younger seal that was

228
00:21:54.48 --> 00:22:00.72
going to be heading to Iraq and the young seal was like oh yeah I'm ready I want to kill people

229
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:05.60
and he's you know the guy says you know just seemed a little bit seems like it shouldn't be like that

230
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:14.48
and I was like it's like that bro. I go you know you know a frontline infantry grunt whatever

231
00:22:15.36 --> 00:22:19.92
well I can't I can't speak for all of them. You talk to most of Asmajority of seals

232
00:22:21.28 --> 00:22:25.36
and you say hey if the enemy presents themselves an opportunity if the enemy if there's an

233
00:22:25.36 --> 00:22:34.48
opportunity for you to kill the enemy will you be happy the right word will you be will you hesitate

234
00:22:34.48 --> 00:22:39.84
in the moment truth I'll be like one negative nobody's stoked so that's the reality so

235
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:47.12
there's a little eight ball you know let's face it. He's down for the cost yeah now that's that's

236
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:55.28
the thing is the the very good soldier that you want has that capability but has the discipline

237
00:22:55.28 --> 00:23:01.04
to keep it under control the whole the little clip you made of Jordan Peterson and I talking about

238
00:23:01.04 --> 00:23:09.60
the the the good man is a dangerous man who has their their their danger and their aggression

239
00:23:10.24 --> 00:23:15.44
under control under through discipline all in Terry control that's what what are looking for

240
00:23:15.44 --> 00:23:18.88
that's what are looking for yeah actually that's what we're looking for

241
00:23:21.76 --> 00:23:27.20
next section discipline is based upon competence only a few hours later after he had lost

242
00:23:27.20 --> 00:23:33.76
both legs in combat lieutenant tickinore who had acted as a platoon leader in fifth division 12

243
00:23:33.76 --> 00:23:39.84
army group made this comment to a military observer our officers have to be real leaders

244
00:23:40.72 --> 00:23:47.76
discipline in combat depends largely upon the men's knowing that the officer in charge of them

245
00:23:47.76 --> 00:23:54.64
knows his business and is not reluctant reluctant to take necessary risks. A batiling commander

246
00:23:54.64 --> 00:24:00.08
of the sixth armor division in France makes a similar combat comment unless the officer or

247
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:07.04
NCO knows his job completely the men have no faith in him unless the men have faith in their

248
00:24:07.04 --> 00:24:15.04
leaders their battle discipline will be poor so when they're talking about discipline there they're like

249
00:24:15.04 --> 00:24:19.36
are you is the team going to knew what they need to do when they get when they get the orders to do it

250
00:24:19.36 --> 00:24:25.60
and if they have faith in the leader they'll do it and if they don't guess what which is interesting

251
00:24:25.60 --> 00:24:28.96
because you think well you know it's a military it's a military and if they get ordered do something

252
00:24:28.96 --> 00:24:33.20
no that's what they're talking about here that's what they're talking about it doesn't work like

253
00:24:33.20 --> 00:24:37.04
that doesn't work like that anywhere just because I bark in order you and I have rank over you

254
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:43.76
doesn't mean you're going to do it especially if it's going to get you killed there's a comment here

255
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:49.92
and in these books they just they the sort of the authority times in the author whoever the author is

256
00:24:49.92 --> 00:24:55.20
the the author's chime in and they just write comment and it says comment a leader who is not

257
00:24:55.20 --> 00:24:59.84
gained the respect respect and confidence of his men during training has two strikes again and

258
00:24:59.84 --> 00:25:04.24
when he against him when he answers combat the element of doubt in the minds of his men

259
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:10.32
may be the difference between success and failure of a mission gaining respect and confidence

260
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:14.64
of your men how do you do that do you that by barking out of no do you that by yelling out of no

261
00:25:15.76 --> 00:25:18.56
you do that by listening you do that by treating them with respect

262
00:25:20.88 --> 00:25:27.20
here is a definition of discipline says Colonel E. L. Montz and Signal Corps true discipline is

263
00:25:27.20 --> 00:25:36.32
voluntary it is based on knowledge region a sense of duty and idealism a good leader

264
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:44.40
develops in his men a cheerful and willing obedience that wants to respond that wants to carry out

265
00:25:44.40 --> 00:25:52.64
his orders this kind of discipline will in the end bring combat results as no other kind possibly

266
00:25:52.64 --> 00:25:59.60
can we could probably stop right here because everyone thinks when the military talks about discipline

267
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:04.24
they're talking about the what if you can beat your people into submission

268
00:26:04.24 --> 00:26:09.28
then you're going to be good to go no that's not the kind of discipline we're talking about

269
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.80
cheerful willing obedience that's a totally different thing willing obedience people want to carry out

270
00:26:18.80 --> 00:26:25.76
the orders you know totally different you don't really think of discipline associated with cheerful

271
00:26:26.96 --> 00:26:33.12
yeah you the context that they're using is military discipline is like hey do the does the team

272
00:26:33.12 --> 00:26:43.84
respond and execute what they're told to do with discipline right so in the context of that

273
00:26:43.84 --> 00:26:50.16
we there's multiple ways to achieve that one of them is by beating people that you're going to

274
00:26:50.16 --> 00:26:54.80
do this and you beat them and they're afraid and they're doing it out of fear the other way is

275
00:26:54.80 --> 00:27:00.40
they're doing it because they understand because they're part of it the result is the result is similar

276
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:09.52
but what this guy is saying is that the one that will bring combat results like no other kind

277
00:27:09.52 --> 00:27:15.84
is the kind where it's a positive discipline yeah when they say it's a self imposed discipline

278
00:27:15.84 --> 00:27:25.84
we're doing this because we want to not because someone's barking at us this little section here

279
00:27:25.84 --> 00:27:32.40
it's a replacement instruction the wrong kind so in in in in world war two you had guys get wounded

280
00:27:32.40 --> 00:27:37.52
guys get killed and there was replacements coming in and so this happens inside all organizations

281
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:42.56
as organizations grow you got to bring a new people and as new people come in what happens to

282
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:47.12
replacement orientation right this is like new hires how do you treat your new hires

283
00:27:47.12 --> 00:27:52.56
here's some things that they did it's called the wrong kind a lieutenant comments on his ominous

284
00:27:52.56 --> 00:27:56.96
introduction to frontline existence on my way to the front as an officer replacement I met several

285
00:27:56.96 --> 00:28:03.52
individuals who had come back from the front line invariably they recounted to me their hair raising

286
00:28:03.52 --> 00:28:08.72
experiences their outfits had been wiped out or pinned down for days officers didn't have a

287
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:15.44
dog's chance of survival etc one puttune sergeant went statistical on me he said his puttune

288
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:20.40
lost 16 officers in one two week period I expected confidently that I would be blown to bits

289
00:28:20.40 --> 00:28:27.36
within 15 minutes after my arrival to the front went statistical on yeah that's what you know they're

290
00:28:27.36 --> 00:28:33.60
going hard yeah later experiences shown me that enlisted men who come in as replacements are

291
00:28:33.60 --> 00:28:38.48
subjected to similar morale breaking tales I've tried to get my old men to give the new

292
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:43.60
replacement a break by being careful not to exaggerate their battle experiences or in any way

293
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:48.88
distort the picture of frontline existence give the new men a common sense introduction to the

294
00:28:48.88 --> 00:28:56.08
combat zone and there will be fewer men going on sick call before an attack noncombs and privates

295
00:28:56.08 --> 00:29:02.72
of company K 11th Infantry draw attention to the same problem our replacements come to us

296
00:29:02.72 --> 00:29:08.48
filled with tension and dread caused by stories they have heard in the rear special instructors from

297
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.12
the front should be used as at replacement centers to talk to the new men to talk the new men

298
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:18.80
out of this unnecessary panic of course the soundest remedy is to have the replacements occupied

299
00:29:18.80 --> 00:29:23.28
defensive position for a time but even then the kind of treatment they are given upon arrival

300
00:29:23.28 --> 00:29:28.08
at the front makes a big difference in the amount of good they will do to their new outfit

301
00:29:29.04 --> 00:29:34.40
so how are we treating people at show up at your company and you can have such a huge influence

302
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:40.96
if you do a good job bringing someone on board in a squared away manner don't screw it up

303
00:29:40.96 --> 00:29:46.56
comment company commanders and platoon leaders should meet orient and indoctrinated

304
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:51.60
all replacements so they gain an authentic picture of current battle conditions this should be done

305
00:29:51.60 --> 00:29:57.04
even though battle indoctrination has been started in replacement centers knowing what to expect

306
00:29:57.04 --> 00:30:03.92
even when the expected is bad is better than not knowing and consequently imagining the worst

307
00:30:04.88 --> 00:30:11.20
that's what's going to happen we're going to freak out and and part of this is I think on intentional

308
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:18.48
when people tell stories right if you're to tell me let's say you were in a jiu jitsu tournament and

309
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:23.92
you wanted to tell me about something that happened that happened to you maybe you got caught

310
00:30:23.92 --> 00:30:30.40
negating and look your congregating and it was bad right and you got out of it but it was

311
00:30:30.40 --> 00:30:38.64
a crazy when you when you want to tell me that you want to make me feel how you felt and one of the

312
00:30:38.64 --> 00:30:45.20
ways you can kind of get closer is by making a little exaggeration but I started seeing I started

313
00:30:45.20 --> 00:30:50.80
the wall started coming in and it might not necessarily I understand what you're doing I understand

314
00:30:50.80 --> 00:30:54.32
why you're doing it but you weren't really going to get choked out you're just in a good

315
00:30:54.32 --> 00:31:00.56
guet teen but it wasn't good enough because obviously you got out so people can exaggerate for the purpose

316
00:31:00.56 --> 00:31:10.56
of of of giving the feelings that they had you know this mortar like I've been murdered before

317
00:31:10.56 --> 00:31:15.76
mortar hits mortar hits I don't know I don't know what the closest mortar to me ever was but

318
00:31:15.76 --> 00:31:23.84
maybe let's call it 20 yards or something like that so that's close bro that rocks your world

319
00:31:23.84 --> 00:31:30.72
you're like damn and if I'm just telling you this bro I got mortar I want you to feel like so I might

320
00:31:30.72 --> 00:31:36.16
be stupid I'm practically right on top of me it's 20 yards away bro yeah yeah you're right and if you

321
00:31:36.16 --> 00:31:40.56
don't kind of take a lot of times we'll take that personal you know like fine don't don't lie

322
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.60
don't lie to me and exaggerate like that you know like be accurate kind of thing but you can

323
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:50.32
when you really think about it it makes sense because if you're like unless you're some if you got

324
00:31:50.32 --> 00:31:55.76
mortar like a thousand times you know when it's 20 yards you know oh you don't have to exaggerate

325
00:31:55.76 --> 00:32:00.72
to me because I know but you know most people yeah yeah if I was talking to someone else

326
00:32:01.52 --> 00:32:05.84
be like oh bro you've been mortar for oh yeah oh yeah I was over here oh yeah

327
00:32:05.84 --> 00:32:09.84
man this one landed close it was like 20 yards away you'd be like damn I don't need to explain it

328
00:32:09.84 --> 00:32:13.76
to you but if you don't know yeah exactly then I start making you know I start making it

329
00:32:13.76 --> 00:32:20.24
like a little bit well basically you want them to understand how you might exactly but because and

330
00:32:20.24 --> 00:32:23.28
they don't they don't have the capability to understand what you felt because they weren't there

331
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:27.04
you know something you can imagine like oh yeah if I was there I do this like you have a

332
00:32:27.04 --> 00:32:33.28
misrepresentation of how it would actually feel in the situation that's natural exactly right but

333
00:32:33.28 --> 00:32:37.92
when you're in the situation yeah you can tell me I've never been mortar before and I know so

334
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:42.88
pricing but I haven't if you were like hey yeah we got mortar and it was crazy it was 20 yards away

335
00:32:42.88 --> 00:32:48.80
I'd be like I know how 20 that's not that close that's like I'd be all right oh yeah whatever that's

336
00:32:48.80 --> 00:32:54.32
like half of a 40 yard dash like that's kind of far yeah that's not scary at all but you know

337
00:32:54.32 --> 00:32:59.52
I get in what you explain it's not like that right you in that situation you're you think you're

338
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:04.32
gonna die or whatever you know but yeah so that's a natural thing if you're not in the situation you

339
00:33:04.32 --> 00:33:10.16
can't feel it you never can so let's sort of let's write it on top of us pro it's basically

340
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:13.92
get the standard of understanding up to where it needs to be for me to convey the story you know

341
00:33:13.92 --> 00:33:20.16
that's what we got to watch out for so we care for with that okay then it goes into the right kind

342
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:24.32
of orientation poor orientation of replacements may seriously affect the fighting ability and

343
00:33:24.32 --> 00:33:29.20
survival chances of men themselves and may also endanger the unit with whom they first serve

344
00:33:29.20 --> 00:33:33.76
for these reasons that leaders of putoan squads and companies should find out exactly what

345
00:33:33.76 --> 00:33:38.64
orientation and training have been given the men and should provide essential orientation on the

346
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:47.52
spot in so far as practical before sending them into combat if a divisional training plan similar to

347
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:54.08
that describe below is in operation the problem of inducting new members new men into smaller units

348
00:33:54.08 --> 00:34:00.32
is much simplified and lower unit orientation can be modified accordingly then there's an effective

349
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:05.68
an effective training system described our division has received thousands of replacements since

350
00:34:05.68 --> 00:34:10.72
it first since it's first combat experience enormity more than 90% of these replacements have been

351
00:34:10.72 --> 00:34:15.36
infantry many of the replacements came into the division lacking confidence in their ability and

352
00:34:15.36 --> 00:34:22.80
paralyzed by the apprehension and gendered by loose talk before and upon their rival exact

353
00:34:22.80 --> 00:34:30.56
guys are scared shitless sometime ago we started a course of instruction for our replacements

354
00:34:30.56 --> 00:34:37.20
they last two and a half days and is conducted by battle experienced personnel particular emphasis

355
00:34:37.20 --> 00:34:43.92
is placed upon how to live in a foxhole development of an aggressive attitude the use of

356
00:34:43.92 --> 00:34:49.68
fragmentation grenade anti-takernade and bazooka throughout the course these men are trained in groups

357
00:34:49.68 --> 00:34:55.28
of 12 they are later assigned to organizations by these same groups you know what I'll tell people about

358
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:02.40
is it close out here by saying we we found that this course of instruction gives replacements

359
00:35:02.40 --> 00:35:06.96
much greater self confidence it debunks the notions that they have picked up in the rear

360
00:35:06.96 --> 00:35:12.32
the course has definitely improved not only the morale but also the fighting ability of our

361
00:35:12.32 --> 00:35:18.000
replacements who expect to continue the plan for all replacements to come into the division you know

362
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.88
what else you gotta tell people is like oh you're gonna be nervous but it's okay you're gonna be nervous

363
00:35:22.88 --> 00:35:29.44
it's no big deal everyone's nervous no big deal it's fine that helps a lot because I've seen

364
00:35:29.44 --> 00:35:34.16
this with fighters they get nervous and they don't know what nervous feel like even a really

365
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:38.48
experienced athletes that might have wrestled or they might have you know boxed or they might

366
00:35:38.48 --> 00:35:43.04
have done smokers they might even have a decent MMA record but now they're going in the UFC

367
00:35:43.84 --> 00:35:48.24
and they get nervous for the first time and they don't know what they don't know that feeling

368
00:35:48.24 --> 00:35:52.08
and all of a sudden they think it's bad yeah something's wrong and you gotta say hey listen

369
00:35:52.08 --> 00:35:55.76
oh you're feeling a little like queasy right now feeling some butterflies that's good

370
00:35:55.76 --> 00:36:00.80
that's your body putting your blood into your muscles instead of to your stomach it's all good

371
00:36:05.20 --> 00:36:12.56
common failings says a successful third army rifle company commander

372
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:18.88
the following failings are common among replacements they must be strictly and promptly eliminated

373
00:36:18.88 --> 00:36:25.04
if excessive casualties are to be avoided and combat efficiency obtained lack of ordinary discipline

374
00:36:25.04 --> 00:36:32.48
saying yeah instead of saying yes sir jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming

375
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:43.04
artillery show we acted like we were like straight up nom like that's in a

376
00:36:43.04 --> 00:36:50.32
body like with the guys would show up and sometimes there'd be outgoing artillery from camp or body

377
00:36:50.32 --> 00:36:55.84
it's outgoing we like we're all this hard to work that's what's fun with that that's what

378
00:36:55.84 --> 00:37:01.36
I was gonna ask like is that a thing because like you know when you first encounter gunfire even

379
00:37:01.36 --> 00:37:08.48
if it's like you know the guy next year whatever shooting outgoing you know as we say it can

380
00:37:08.48 --> 00:37:14.64
startle you if you don't hear that all the time it's so loud so I'll be like this at the gun

381
00:37:14.64 --> 00:37:20.64
range bear with me I know so at the gun range you know when you first go in you start hearing

382
00:37:20.64 --> 00:37:24.80
the boom and then you know you got a little jump you know but after a while you go if you

383
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:28.88
time do whatever it's like you don't jump at all but then let's say you take your friend and

384
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:33.20
say it's his first time or something like that first time long time whatever and you see him jump

385
00:37:33.20 --> 00:37:38.96
and then is that a thing like ah you jump you're kind of you know you're gonna get startled I mean

386
00:37:38.96 --> 00:37:42.96
you'll get startled but you do get used to it yeah fully but what I'm saying is let's say mean

387
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:48.80
you go to the gun range somewhere or you know corn out or whatever and like boom you know

388
00:37:48.80 --> 00:37:53.28
shots fired whatever like down range or whatever and I like jump are you gonna tease me is that

389
00:37:53.28 --> 00:37:57.28
the culture you know kind of like like why are you jumping for you know kind of thing

390
00:37:57.28 --> 00:38:03.36
you're asking if I'm gonna tease you yeah answers yes that's kind of a universal thing

391
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:12.88
yeah yeah but but you do get used to it but still like I startling noise but you get you get used

392
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:18.64
I mean we shoot a tawn in the sealed teams oh yeah just like so much yeah it makes sense and again yeah

393
00:38:18.64 --> 00:38:25.52
I you know I haven't shot an a ton in the sealed teams but when I go to the range it's the same

394
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:29.28
thing on a different scale where yeah when you first go in you're like boom or when like you're

395
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:33.68
about to shoot in here the next you shoot you like oh you know you know did my gun go for whatever

396
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:41.76
it's like a joke so I hear so I hear that question I hear my gun my gun my gun this is not

397
00:38:41.76 --> 00:38:47.84
very reassuring but you know I just hear and then but then after a while it doesn't affect you

398
00:38:47.84 --> 00:38:53.04
it's no figure that's natural regardless of the environment you know did Jason Gardner tell

399
00:38:53.04 --> 00:38:58.56
that story on the podcast where the guy they were doing a debrief they're doing a debrief so

400
00:38:58.56 --> 00:39:06.64
Jason Gardner's like at T5 and they're doing a debrief after like a CQC kill house run or something

401
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:13.84
and this young officer standing there during the debrief and he just cracks off a round like

402
00:39:13.84 --> 00:39:18.64
during the debrief supposed to be cleared safe he cracks off around it goes between two of the

403
00:39:18.64 --> 00:39:23.92
guys they're standing in a circle and he cracks off around and the dude had like an out of body

404
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:31.12
experience and he looks up at the group and he says he was decarking it he says he was decarking

405
00:39:31.12 --> 00:39:36.32
it as if it was him that's one of my favorites stories from Gardner dude because that tells you how

406
00:39:36.32 --> 00:39:41.12
people get crazy they they do something and they think that it wasn't even there he's making

407
00:39:41.12 --> 00:39:51.12
excuse for a person that is someone else he was decarking it so there you go jumping at the sound

408
00:39:51.12 --> 00:39:58.000
of every outgoing or incoming artillery shell here's another good one stoner was stoner's

409
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.08
tasking it was going through CQC training and this guy threw a crash into a room and it like

410
00:40:06.08 --> 00:40:11.76
he threw a crash into the room and then went in the room and then like backed out because he

411
00:40:11.76 --> 00:40:15.20
scared the crash because it's something weird like that where the guy was basically scared of the crash

412
00:40:16.48 --> 00:40:21.44
and so stoner was watching and so stoner was like they get done with the run and so he was like

413
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:28.32
hey come with me and stoner got like seven crashes in his pocket and he went into like a small closet

414
00:40:29.68 --> 00:40:33.92
and he goes and he starts talking to the guy all normal and like like hey you know I just want to

415
00:40:33.92 --> 00:40:38.32
talk and as he's pulling the crash out just like undoes it and pulls the pin and just drops it

416
00:40:38.32 --> 00:40:43.04
at their feet and continues talking totally normal just like oh man he does that seven times

417
00:40:44.08 --> 00:40:47.76
and then at the end of whatever he was saying to me goes hey by the way don't be scared of crashes

418
00:40:47.76 --> 00:40:53.60
they're not gonna hurt you oh man wait so are they what do you mean I mean okay they can't

419
00:40:53.60 --> 00:40:58.16
hurry got it but a crash just go bang I mean what you hold in your hand if you hold your hand

420
00:40:58.16 --> 00:41:02.40
it could hurt yeah yeah so he just didn't admit anything yeah it doesn't admit anything it's like

421
00:41:02.40 --> 00:41:06.16
a big firecracker basically yeah I mean and look you don't want to put a firecracker

422
00:41:06.16 --> 00:41:12.32
next to your hand or next to your eye but they're not gonna hurt you yeah I mean you crash each

423
00:41:12.32 --> 00:41:18.88
other all the time so I always thought that was a good lesson learned from stoner to that dude

424
00:41:19.76 --> 00:41:27.44
probably not great for his hearing but oh oh well unwillingness to use the rifle many

425
00:41:27.44 --> 00:41:34.08
have been told never to fire without direct orders for fear of revealing positions lack of pride in

426
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:41.28
self organization or work poor physical condition a tendency to bunch together when in danger I

427
00:41:41.28 --> 00:41:47.04
wrote about that in leadership strategy and tactics not just from a battlefield but also from a

428
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:53.44
mental status we all just want to like crowd each other we get we get we feel comfort being next to

429
00:41:53.44 --> 00:42:01.52
each other don't freezing under fire slavin slavinliness in care of equipment lack of skill with the

430
00:42:01.52 --> 00:42:06.80
rifle or other infantry weapons fear of the night ignorance of squad formations ignorance of

431
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:13.76
field sanitation and of personal hygiene combat comment replacement to exhibit these deficiencies

432
00:42:13.76 --> 00:42:18.96
usually have usually not had the advantage of such training system as described above

433
00:42:18.96 --> 00:42:27.76
so think about how you're indoctrinating your people you can probably do a better job of it

434
00:42:27.76 --> 00:42:33.52
the next section is about river crossing as it goes by this whole this is these are tactical things

435
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:41.12
trying to help people win this war these are tactical things about literally how to cross rivers

436
00:42:41.12 --> 00:42:47.28
very cold a read I'm not gonna cover it right now it covers assault boat handling and water safety

437
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:52.08
and foot bridges and cable bridges and engineer bridges it just goes on all these detailed

438
00:42:52.96 --> 00:43:04.72
sections then it goes into this story about Roger Young and it's got a song that's got a song

439
00:43:04.72 --> 00:43:11.68
with musical notes that you can sing I'm gonna read you the the lyrics in first part of it oh

440
00:43:11.68 --> 00:43:18.16
they've got no time for glory in the infantry oh they've got no use for praises loudly sung

441
00:43:19.20 --> 00:43:27.04
but in every soldier's heart in all the infantry shines the name shines the name of Roger Young

442
00:43:28.24 --> 00:43:34.32
Roger Young who fought and died for the men he marched among so

443
00:43:35.52 --> 00:43:40.32
this story is about a metal of honor recipient and it tells a bit of the story here that

444
00:43:40.32 --> 00:43:46.64
that song is about this metal of honor recipient Roger Young on July 31st 1943 the infantry

445
00:43:46.64 --> 00:43:51.84
company of which private young was a member was ordered to make a limited withdrawal from the

446
00:43:51.84 --> 00:43:56.72
battle line in order to adjust the battalion's position for the night at this time private

447
00:43:56.72 --> 00:44:02.24
young Splatoon was engaged with the enemy in dense jungle where observation was limited the

448
00:44:02.24 --> 00:44:08.16
Splatoon was suddenly pinned down by intense fire from a Japanese machine gun concealed on higher ground

449
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:15.28
only 75 yards away the initial burst wounded private young as the Platoon started to obey the order

450
00:44:15.28 --> 00:44:23.12
to withdraw private young started creeping toward the emplacement despite a second wound he continued

451
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:30.64
his heroic advance attracting enemy fire and answering with rifle fire I'm close to his objective

452
00:44:30.64 --> 00:44:36.16
he began throwing hand grenades and while doing so he was hit again and killed private

453
00:44:36.16 --> 00:44:41.28
young's bold action in closing with this Japanese pill box and thus diverting its fire

454
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:47.76
permitted his platoon to disengage itself without loss and was responsible for several enemy

455
00:44:47.76 --> 00:44:58.40
casualties like I said Roger Young was he received the metal of honor for this action and I looked

456
00:44:58.40 --> 00:45:04.48
up I looked up Roger Young it's an interesting story he was from a small town up in Ohio

457
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:09.60
to play it's called Tiff and Ohio and sometime during high school he was a really good athlete

458
00:45:09.60 --> 00:45:14.32
he was small but he was a really good athlete and sometime in high school he was playing

459
00:45:14.32 --> 00:45:23.28
an either basketball or football he got some weird injury some weird head injury that left him

460
00:45:23.28 --> 00:45:29.76
almost completely deaf and blind like he could see but not really well he could hear but not really

461
00:45:29.76 --> 00:45:35.36
well and he was worried about being able to get into the regular army so he joined the national

462
00:45:35.36 --> 00:45:40.88
guard and he was like a really good soldier despite the fact that he couldn't see very well

463
00:45:40.88 --> 00:45:49.68
and he couldn't hear very well and before this this assault in New Georgia and this island

464
00:45:49.68 --> 00:45:55.28
in New Georgia which is in the Solomon Islands before this assault he had been advanced in rank

465
00:45:55.28 --> 00:46:03.60
and he went to his leadership and requested a demotion because he felt like he was putting his

466
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:07.44
guys at risk because he couldn't see well enough and he couldn't hear well enough and at first

467
00:46:07.44 --> 00:46:12.64
they thought he was just trying to get out of the you know he's just trying to not do this do this

468
00:46:12.64 --> 00:46:18.96
assault and he said no I'm doing the assault I'm doing the assault but I shouldn't be in charge of

469
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:25.04
anyone because I can barely see and I can barely hear and they said okay Roger that they

470
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:29.60
demoted him so he wasn't in charge of a squad anymore and he just became a rifleman

471
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:32.88
went out there and saved his guys

472
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:45.44
next section's called patrol pointers

473
00:46:48.16 --> 00:46:54.24
commanders and staffs as well as troops should be made to realize the amount of detail

474
00:46:54.24 --> 00:46:59.76
essential to proper preparation of a patrol for each mission and precise the fact that the

475
00:46:59.76 --> 00:47:05.92
patrol leader must be given the means to end time to accomplish his mission how often do we actually

476
00:47:05.92 --> 00:47:09.92
think about what where it's tasking people with you got to realize what you're asking people with

477
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:13.52
what time it's going to take how much time they need to prepare for

478
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:20.64
contact with the main force leaders of flank and security or security patrols should be

479
00:47:20.64 --> 00:47:24.40
impressed with the importance of maintaining contact with the main force at all times

480
00:47:25.52 --> 00:47:31.04
loss of contact has often proved disastrous so you have to maintain communications

481
00:47:33.04 --> 00:47:37.76
the opposite extreme there we got a little dichotomy going here the opposite extreme however

482
00:47:39.12 --> 00:47:45.04
can also have serious results one patrol leader over zealous about maintaining contact

483
00:47:45.04 --> 00:47:50.08
cause the attack to involve the main body and develop into a major action for which the latter

484
00:47:50.08 --> 00:47:54.24
was not prepared so this guy kept everyone so close that by the time they did the assault the main body

485
00:47:54.24 --> 00:47:58.96
got caught up in the assault as well so there's a dichotomy you got a balance

486
00:48:02.80 --> 00:48:07.68
patrol leadership strictest discipline must be maintained during a patrol operation

487
00:48:07.68 --> 00:48:13.60
rigid control should be exercised to eliminate unnecessary noise talking sneezing and most

488
00:48:13.60 --> 00:48:21.68
important ill-advised firing all movement must be regulated to take full advantage of conditions such

489
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:28.80
as rainstorms temporary obscuring of the moon by clouds etc so this is what we got to remember

490
00:48:28.80 --> 00:48:35.20
when we say strictest discipline has to be maintained and control if you and I are in a patrol

491
00:48:35.20 --> 00:48:39.92
and you're in the back of the patrol and I'm the year of the rear security and I'm the PL

492
00:48:39.92 --> 00:48:46.32
I'm the patrol leader and I'm number two so there's 14 18 22 guys between us how do I control what

493
00:48:46.32 --> 00:48:52.56
you're going to do? I can't and if you see something that makes you nervous you can start shooting

494
00:48:52.56 --> 00:48:57.36
you know you might start making a call you might be doing dumb things why is that because you're

495
00:48:57.36 --> 00:49:00.88
dumb no it's because I'm a bad leader because I didn't explain to you what the parameters

496
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:04.24
were of what we're doing I didn't explain to you why we're doing what we're doing I didn't

497
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:08.08
explain to you the dangers of shooting your rifle if you weren't sure of what was happening

498
00:49:08.08 --> 00:49:13.52
so when they say control don't think of it like oh I've got to sit there and tell everyone exactly

499
00:49:13.52 --> 00:49:17.76
what to do you're going to really lose then what you have to do is you have to utilize

500
00:49:19.12 --> 00:49:26.16
powerful and and and well executed decentralized command that's what control is

501
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:33.60
back to the book one patrol had almost completed its mission when its presence and location

502
00:49:33.60 --> 00:49:39.12
were revealed to the enemy through an unguarded movement by one of the members this betrayal

503
00:49:39.12 --> 00:49:45.52
nullified the entire effort of that particular patrol patience is of the utmost importance in patrolling

504
00:49:46.40 --> 00:49:53.12
that's true the success or failure of a patrol depends in the final analysis upon the

505
00:49:53.12 --> 00:49:58.56
qualities of leadership possessed by the patrol leader in most cases the commanders have selected

506
00:49:58.56 --> 00:50:05.28
their best officers and NCOs to perform in his duty leadership is what makes a patrol successful

507
00:50:05.28 --> 00:50:07.04
leadership

508
00:50:09.20 --> 00:50:13.76
organizing professional patrols this is an interesting combat concept some commanders have

509
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:17.92
gone so far as to organize permanent patrol groups whose principal function is to furnish

510
00:50:17.92 --> 00:50:22.48
personnel for battle missions the officer selected for these groups are volunteers the most

511
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:27.04
aggressive tough and rugged officers in the unit they are permitted to select from the unit

512
00:50:27.04 --> 00:50:31.92
men who possess the same qualities after a period of intensive training in scouting patrol in

513
00:50:31.92 --> 00:50:38.08
battle drill and physical hardening the patrol group is attached to the unit headquarters

514
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:41.84
from which it receives its mission so he's talking look you can make a little element that's

515
00:50:41.84 --> 00:50:48.16
made of your best guys fatigue and strain and dirt by battle patrols make it impracticable

516
00:50:48.16 --> 00:50:53.12
to assign them more than one major mission every two or three days upon completion of a mission

517
00:50:53.12 --> 00:50:59.04
the men should be moved to a rear location fed rested and prepared for the next what I say is

518
00:50:59.04 --> 00:51:06.40
interesting about this is what do you have in your company that's a duty or a mission or a task

519
00:51:06.40 --> 00:51:12.40
that maybe it's such a such importance that you put together a little hit team and they get good at it

520
00:51:12.40 --> 00:51:15.76
and they do it all the time and you give them the support and you give them the training that's a

521
00:51:15.76 --> 00:51:20.000
very sensible thing to think about now it doesn't mean you have to exclude everybody else because

522
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.48
I can have a hit team of four people that do presentations to clients that doesn't mean

523
00:51:26.48 --> 00:51:29.36
I send two other guys you know occasionally I throw this guy throw this guy throw this guy

524
00:51:29.36 --> 00:51:34.40
so other people learn and maybe they spend some time in the hit team but it's an interesting

525
00:51:34.40 --> 00:51:39.60
concept and a good one to make someone a professional at that particular part of the duty

526
00:51:40.64 --> 00:51:43.92
I mean you're a football player that's like what football is right specialty

527
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:47.60
essentially right yeah I mean it didn't used to be that way

528
00:51:48.32 --> 00:51:52.40
used to be like hey what we're gonna play football everybody's playing yeah we're just playing football

529
00:51:52.40 --> 00:51:59.36
yeah now it's like I'm only going out with this plays app that's an interesting way to look at

530
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:03.36
yeah only one this plays app yeah I mean there's some people I don't only play one play

531
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:09.28
yeah kicker kicker a wedge breaker something that can be kind of versatile

532
00:52:09.28 --> 00:52:13.84
yeah you're right specialty probably there is this guy actually he was a whiter seever but

533
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:20.72
what the heck was his name he played at you eight trade he was just well and he was a whiter seever

534
00:52:20.72 --> 00:52:26.000
for sure and he did some things or whatever but it was marginal compared to what his specialty was

535
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.48
was blocking field goals and puns he's on the outside because he could run real fast if that's got

536
00:52:30.48 --> 00:52:37.52
a team yeah he yes he had the instinct he was just so yeah the instinct and his speed he was a

537
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:44.56
fast guy in the team so the way he could just like get his rod and rebounding yeah yeah

538
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:49.52
he was in his rod but I mean it's the scenario is a little bit different because it's not like

539
00:52:49.52 --> 00:52:53.60
they're like hey we need to call the rebounder you know then it's running and I was just playing

540
00:52:53.60 --> 00:52:58.72
okay some same but this guy hey they're about to kick a field goal a freaking what the heck was

541
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:03.20
his name Matt oh man they're gonna be mad at me for not remembering that so this guy had good

542
00:53:03.20 --> 00:53:08.48
instincts to get that hand on the ball speed instincts you know what's weird about this is he must have

543
00:53:08.48 --> 00:53:14.88
been really good to actually be identified as that guy yep totally was he was famous for that so it was

544
00:53:14.88 --> 00:53:19.68
like the team was like kind of known for that like hey buckle up when we kick field goals or puns

545
00:53:19.68 --> 00:53:24.08
like this guy's coming so there was time they got to the point where they would stack that side wherever

546
00:53:24.08 --> 00:53:29.12
he was which is dangerous to do because you open up the other side for other guys but bro it's

547
00:53:29.12 --> 00:53:35.76
that important that's so good that's so good the specialized skill he had developed you know

548
00:53:36.56 --> 00:53:42.24
there's something to be said about this concept and specializing and focusing on something

549
00:53:43.60 --> 00:53:48.56
I was watching a thing about Wayne Gretzky and when he was like he would sit there and watch hockey

550
00:53:48.56 --> 00:53:54.88
games as a kid and while he was watching the hockey game he would trace the puck like with a pen

551
00:53:54.88 --> 00:53:59.60
on the on the on like a piece of paper like he draw hockey ring and then he would sit there and

552
00:53:59.60 --> 00:54:04.32
trace where the puck went where to go the whole time and then when the game was over three

553
00:54:04.32 --> 00:54:09.36
periods later he would look at the where his marks were on this piece of paper and start to think

554
00:54:09.36 --> 00:54:13.28
that's where the puck is this is where the puck is most time this is where I need to be

555
00:54:13.92 --> 00:54:19.28
and same with Dennis Rodman he would know where different shooters on his team what kind of spin

556
00:54:19.28 --> 00:54:23.68
they put on the ball and he'd be able to assess where that ball was gonna go where's the highest

557
00:54:23.68 --> 00:54:30.000
chance of that happening that's what he focused on so if you can do that with a team and you can

558
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.76
get a team focused on a particular item they're gonna excel at it it's a good concept and the

559
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:40.16
comment here says the presence of a professional patrol group in a unit should not be considered

560
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:45.20
a complete solution to the patrolling problem nor should it operate to curtail the training of individual

561
00:54:45.20 --> 00:54:48.64
riflemen and scouting of patrolling right this doesn't mean you got rodents and now no one else

562
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:52.80
needs to work on their rebounding the professional groups should be used for difficult or

563
00:54:52.80 --> 00:55:00.000
special missions while normally normal with trying continues as well now this section that I'm about

564
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.48
to read this is kind of this is one of the ones where when I read these for the first time I was like

565
00:55:04.48 --> 00:55:11.68
this one's kind of it's a good debrief because it's a failure and they actually debrief a mission here

566
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:20.80
this section is called how not to patrol and it's got notes in it a six army report includes

567
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:25.28
this account of an unsuccessful patrol action in New Guinea those some members of the patrol

568
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:29.60
exhibited splendid courage and initiative the mission was not accomplished in casualties were high

569
00:55:29.60 --> 00:55:34.80
the negative results of this patrol action were doing large part to several violations of basic

570
00:55:34.80 --> 00:55:40.32
patrol principles as pointed out below a map of the area shown on the opposite page

571
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.72
so the terrain that they're dealing with there's a section on terrain the coastal flat northwest

572
00:55:48.72 --> 00:55:54.32
river there's a river and the way the river is broken out the rivers covered with

573
00:55:54.32 --> 00:55:59.68
kunei grass two to five feet hot feet high interspersed with wooded areas traveling as difficult

574
00:55:59.68 --> 00:56:04.08
and exhausting trees in the wooded areas are not close together but the underbrushes,

575
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:08.40
dense and visibility limited so you already know this is freaking horrible this is hard

576
00:56:08.40 --> 00:56:14.08
terrain to get through a track paralleling the beach is about eight feet wide and clear of underbrush

577
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:19.84
along the beaches of four to eight foot embankment suitable for cover against small arms fire from

578
00:56:19.84 --> 00:56:27.84
inland the width of the river varies from 15 feet in some places to 35 feet feet in others

579
00:56:27.84 --> 00:56:33.28
its current is swift the stream bread is rocky and relatively shallow except for the main channel

580
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:37.44
which at the time of this patrol action was more than six feet deep as a result of recent rains

581
00:56:39.12 --> 00:56:43.92
so the way this is set up there's like this they're on an island they got the ocean

582
00:56:43.92 --> 00:56:52.000
it's a beach there's an outpost that's to the south end outpost a and then there's a river mouth

583
00:56:52.40 --> 00:56:58.96
and this patrol goes across the river to enemy territory and they've got these various locations

584
00:56:58.96 --> 00:57:04.48
a is the outpost and across the river you got this coconut plantation you got a perimeter that

585
00:57:04.48 --> 00:57:09.44
gets set up and you got a little village up there and they've got all these routes that go in and out

586
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:14.88
route k they take in route l one element takes out route and another element takes out so

587
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:22.88
there's a lot going on in this in this patrol and I don't want to get too wrapped around trying

588
00:57:22.88 --> 00:57:27.52
to explain like exactly what happened without the visuals but the patrol consisted of a rifle

589
00:57:27.52 --> 00:57:31.68
between reinforced by two sixty millimeter mortar squads one intelligence man a radio operator an

590
00:57:31.68 --> 00:57:38.08
eight man second lieutenant why the platoon leader was in command first lieutenant x from wise company

591
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:45.68
was attached to the patrol as observer and coordinator comment the higher commander keeps

592
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:50.72
the accomplishment of the mission in mind when he selects the patrol leader the more important

593
00:57:50.72 --> 00:57:57.68
the mission the more careful his selection must be a good leader should have judgment initiative

594
00:57:57.68 --> 00:58:06.40
courage endurance and be a highly skilled leader the attachment of lieutenant x as coordinator

595
00:58:06.40 --> 00:58:13.04
not only divided responsibility but also indicated a doubt in the commander's mind as to wise

596
00:58:13.04 --> 00:58:18.32
ability to lead the patrol so you've got you've got this second lieutenant that's going out there

597
00:58:18.32 --> 00:58:24.000
in command but you put a first lieutenant with him it doesn't make any sense and that's what

598
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.44
they're that's what their common is you're kind of you're kind of throwing two people if you

599
00:58:27.44 --> 00:58:31.68
don't trust one guy to run the mission don't don't do it it's just a rifle platoon why

600
00:58:31.68 --> 00:58:34.80
you send in two officers out there do you not have confidence one of them and if that's the

601
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:41.12
case why you send in about there important thing to think about and what does it do to the minds

602
00:58:41.12 --> 00:58:46.96
of the troops hey we there's the boss cool oh wait now we got another boss wait a second why we

603
00:58:46.96 --> 00:58:55.92
get two bosses the mission the mission the patrol is across the river in vicinity of the

604
00:58:55.92 --> 00:59:03.84
battalion outpost reconwear to the coastal area south of this village and destroy any enemy

605
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:09.12
found right so there you go but i'm gonna read that again the mission of patrol is to cross the

606
00:59:09.12 --> 00:59:15.36
river in the vicinity of the battalion outpost do reconnaissance of the coastal area

607
00:59:16.40 --> 00:59:22.56
and destroy any enemy found and it says here comment the mission assigned by the higher commander

608
00:59:22.56 --> 00:59:28.96
to the patrol leader must be specific and unmistakable indefinite missions invite confusion casualties

609
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:35.52
and failures one patrol cannot be expected to to execute efficiently a number of missions and by the

610
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:42.08
way they're quoting field manuals for this that's FM 2175 reconnaissance patrols are used primarily

611
00:59:42.08 --> 00:59:49.20
to secure information maintain contact with the enemy or observe terrain they avoid unnecessary combat

612
00:59:49.20 --> 00:59:54.16
and accomplish the mission by stealth reconnaissance patrols engage in fire fights only when

613
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:58.08
necessary to accomplish their mission order protect themselves so you see the dichotomy here

614
00:59:58.08 --> 01:00:02.80
we want you to re-conocense but we want you to destroy any enemy that you find that's two different

615
01:00:02.80 --> 01:00:08.40
things that's saying i want you to fight someone and run away from them at the same time

616
01:00:10.08 --> 01:00:15.04
a combat patrol executes missions which they which may require fighting to accomplish or to help

617
01:00:15.04 --> 01:00:21.44
accomplish every combat patrol secure information as a secondary mission then here's the comment

618
01:00:21.44 --> 01:00:26.56
this patrol had been given two primary missions reconnaissance and combat without any indication

619
01:00:26.56 --> 01:00:33.12
as to which has priority prioritize next to we need to know what the priority is the directive to

620
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.16
destroy any enemy found in the area if taken as the primary mission will preclude successful

621
01:00:38.16 --> 01:00:42.000
will preclude successful operation as a reconnaissance patrol the mission should have been

622
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.40
either combat with reconnaissance as a secondary mission or reconnaissance alone in which case the

623
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:50.80
patrol would engage in combat only to the extent necessary to complete its reconnaissance mission so

624
01:00:50.80 --> 01:00:55.76
think about that when you're assigning someone a mission make sure they understand what the

625
01:00:55.76 --> 01:01:01.60
damn mission is and don't assign them two missions that are opposed to each other and when you do

626
01:01:01.60 --> 01:01:06.80
assign people two or three missions or tasks or projects make sure they know what the priority

627
01:01:06.80 --> 01:01:15.60
mission is what the priority project is the patrol departed out of the outpost at 10 15 leaving

628
01:01:15.60 --> 01:01:21.04
a 160 millimeter mortar squad to furnish fire support a rope secured of both banks were used to

629
01:01:21.04 --> 01:01:27.44
help put the patrol way across the stream by 11 15 personnel and equipment had crossed and

630
01:01:27.44 --> 01:01:32.96
we're waiting for scheduled artillery concentration before moving forward at 11 30 80 rounds of 105

631
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:40.32
was fired after completion of the artillery fire the patrol reconnoiided along the route to the beach

632
01:01:41.60 --> 01:01:45.76
except for the killing of three japs by the rear point no contact was made and the trip was on

633
01:01:45.76 --> 01:01:54.08
eventful okay at 1405 the patrol arrived at sea which is they they basically patrol from the

634
01:01:54.08 --> 01:01:58.80
outpost which is on the beach inland a little bit and to the north and then they get to the beach

635
01:01:58.80 --> 01:02:02.72
up north and they set up a perimeter that's the point sea that they're talking about

636
01:02:03.84 --> 01:02:07.44
for purposes of command and control the patrol was divided into three sections

637
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:14.08
consisting respectively of second lieutenant y and ten men the platoon sergeant and 13 men

638
01:02:14.08 --> 01:02:18.72
and first lieutenant x and 20 men so now we're dividing

639
01:02:22.40 --> 01:02:27.36
and the comment is actually command and control were not improved by this organization as was

640
01:02:27.36 --> 01:02:33.84
demonstrated later lieutenant y in addition to commanding the patrol was also commanding one of the

641
01:02:33.84 --> 01:02:39.84
sections lieutenant x as a loop as a section leader was now under the command of his junior lieutenant

642
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:46.48
so if you ever heard me say you probably have if you want to be in charge of everything you want

643
01:02:46.48 --> 01:02:49.92
to be in charge of nothing so when you're supposed to be in charge of a patrol and then you take

644
01:02:49.92 --> 01:02:54.48
charge of a section you're not going to be able to control everything you're going to be focused on

645
01:02:54.48 --> 01:03:00.64
the the squad or the section that you're leading so that's why you have subordinate leadership so

646
01:03:00.64 --> 01:03:04.24
they can look down and in and run that little element and you can look up and out and see what

647
01:03:04.24 --> 01:03:12.08
the whole team is doing together and you can mutually support each other and cover and move for each other

648
01:03:13.04 --> 01:03:17.44
at this time radio communications with the battalion commander at outpost was established

649
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.08
however radio soon went out did not function thereafter contact the first contact with the

650
01:03:22.08 --> 01:03:26.48
enemy came shortly after the reorganization had been completed about twenty japs with armed armed

651
01:03:26.48 --> 01:03:30.96
with automatic weapons attacked the perimeter from the southwest apparently this group had followed

652
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:36.72
the trail made by the patrol in the brief ensuing scrimous teneming were killed and then remained

653
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.12
dispersed okay they do okay through that one patrol then move southeast along the coastal

654
01:03:41.12 --> 01:03:47.12
track toward coconut grove at b so now they were far up north in the perimeter now they start moving

655
01:03:47.12 --> 01:03:52.64
south towards this coconut grove when advanced element of the patrol reached the northwest edge

656
01:03:52.64 --> 01:03:57.76
of the coconut grove they received heavy machine gun fire rifle mortar hand grenade fire

657
01:03:57.76 --> 01:04:03.28
from their front and right flank so this is a bad scenario cross fire three members of the

658
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:07.92
patrol were wounded it was estimated that about fifty enemy fighters were in the grove

659
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:13.84
first lieutenant ex assumed command and because they had a fire order the patrol to return to the

660
01:04:13.84 --> 01:04:19.60
former beach at position c to the wounded man had been it had to be assisted after their arrival

661
01:04:19.60 --> 01:04:24.48
so now they go back to this perimeter that they had after their arrival at c the firing stopped

662
01:04:24.48 --> 01:04:28.88
and the temporary perimeter was organized so they they get back the regroup they got two wounded

663
01:04:29.52 --> 01:04:34.16
lieutenant ex finding them into closely grouped ordered two sections to move forward further inland

664
01:04:34.16 --> 01:04:39.20
neither section moved as far as lieutenant ex intended so he signaled them to move further

665
01:04:40.80 --> 01:04:45.36
so their inner perimeter lieutenant ex says hey push out from the perimeter a little bit they

666
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:52.000
don't really move far enough so he gives him a signal to move further this signal was interpreted

667
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.40
to mean that the sections were to return to the river via separate routes as had been discussed

668
01:04:58.40 --> 01:05:03.76
earlier when the patrol first reorganized it see because both sections moved out leaving lieutenant

669
01:05:03.76 --> 01:05:08.48
ex by himself with his twenty men so now we have completely we have three different sections out here

670
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:14.96
three different elements out there and you do not want to split forces in the first place and you

671
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:18.16
definitely want to split forces into three groups and you definitely don't want to split forces

672
01:05:18.16 --> 01:05:21.84
into three groups and you all wounded and you've already been attacked by a fifty man enemy force

673
01:05:21.84 --> 01:05:28.80
this is crazy the comment the patrol must be directed regulated and controlled at all times

674
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:33.52
patrol members must be familiar with all prescribed signals the leader may arrange for a few

675
01:05:33.52 --> 01:05:39.20
additional signals for special purposes in this instance and in this instance the loss of control

676
01:05:39.20 --> 01:05:45.04
can undoubtedly be attributed to the poor chain of command in the patrol organization to sudden change

677
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:50.16
in command from lieutenant y to lieutenant ex while the patrol is in and contact with the enemy

678
01:05:50.16 --> 01:05:59.52
and to a failure to reach clear understanding of plans and signals you can see how these little

679
01:05:59.52 --> 01:06:04.08
compounding problems and if you look at your organization if you look at what you're doing inside

680
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:09.52
of your business what little what little mistakes are you making what little what little things

681
01:06:09.52 --> 01:06:13.84
are you compounding what problems do you have that can be compounding that can lead to disaster

682
01:06:13.84 --> 01:06:20.80
is it communication is it chain of command are you not mutually supporting each other

683
01:06:21.68 --> 01:06:27.92
do people not understand what the mission is you see this applies to everything that we do

684
01:06:27.92 --> 01:06:34.08
with any kind of team the trip back the platoon sergeant with his 13 men followed the route m

685
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:40.80
so basically they all start going back in different directions they cross the river without incident

686
01:06:40.80 --> 01:06:46.72
and reported back to caught so they get back this first group of 13 guys gets back to the

687
01:06:46.72 --> 01:06:51.76
command post the battalion command post second lieutenant why in his ten men made it wider circuit

688
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:58.72
and they report back to battalion an hour later without having contacted the enemy

689
01:06:59.36 --> 01:07:03.68
okay so we're doing pretty good but first lieutenant ex realized that the other two sections

690
01:07:03.68 --> 01:07:07.44
had gone he proceeded to the river to another route and he's got the wounded guys

691
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:13.92
one of the wounded died and route the body was carried the section reached the one point on the

692
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:19.76
river without difficulty but found the point in the river that they got the river was 30 feet wide

693
01:07:19.76 --> 01:07:25.68
and the current was very swift and it would have been dangerous even for excellent swimmers

694
01:07:25.68 --> 01:07:30.80
and attempt to reach the original crossing site was unsuccessful because the enemy was in position

695
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:37.12
because the enemy would they try to go back where they originally crossed that's where they

696
01:07:37.12 --> 01:07:42.08
try and go back to and guess what the enemy is waiting for in there obviously they know how hard

697
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:48.08
it is crosses river they know the crossing points patrol should return from up this is comment patrol

698
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:52.96
should return from a mission over a different route to avoid ambush alternate crossing points

699
01:07:52.96 --> 01:07:59.44
could have been determined by reconnaissance before the combat patrol was sent out it appears that

700
01:07:59.44 --> 01:08:04.88
the enemy allowed the patrol to cross the river unaposed and planned to ambush it by closing in behind

701
01:08:11.28 --> 01:08:17.12
so now lieutenant ex goes back so they get they get fought away from the place where they originally

702
01:08:17.12 --> 01:08:23.36
crossed he sets up a perimeter anticipation of attack by the enemy a sergeant was then sent out

703
01:08:23.36 --> 01:08:30.40
with the mission of crossing the river and reporting to the battalion commander for help the next

704
01:08:30.40 --> 01:08:34.96
section is called the rescue meanwhile the battalion commander received a situation report from the

705
01:08:34.96 --> 01:08:39.84
leader of the section which returned acting upon this information the battalion commander had formed a

706
01:08:39.84 --> 01:08:45.76
group of 20 men and had proceeded to the vicinity of this island and this is another thing that screwed

707
01:08:45.76 --> 01:08:51.28
up and when you see it on the terrain where this element wants to cross over they're going to

708
01:08:51.28 --> 01:08:55.04
cross the river but they're going to cross on to like a little mini island where they'll have to

709
01:08:55.04 --> 01:08:58.64
do another freaking crossing but they don't know that because they haven't done recon.

710
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:08.40
believing that this to be the balance of the patrol also so this group was preparing to cross the river

711
01:09:08.40 --> 01:09:14.40
to aid the remainder of patrol when they observed lieutenant wine his section crossing back

712
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:18.96
and so now the battalion thinks oh okay they're coming back now so we're good so they all go back

713
01:09:18.96 --> 01:09:23.92
to they all go back to the battalion and then the battalion figures out the battalion commander figures

714
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:29.12
out oh wait you didn't even bring back all the guys so two groups have come back but there's a third

715
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:37.04
group out there now the battalion commander's like trying to figure out what to do so he goes back out again

716
01:09:37.04 --> 01:09:40.88
and again this is the battalion commander this is a very senior guy going out to execute this rescue

717
01:09:40.88 --> 01:09:45.20
mission in order to evacuate and they link up in order to evacuate the wounded it was decided that

718
01:09:45.20 --> 01:09:49.84
a rope must be used several attempts by lieutenant extra cross the river with the rope or unsuccessful

719
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:54.96
finally but the battalion commander and four others grasp hands and formed a human chain out into

720
01:09:54.96 --> 01:10:01.52
the water lieutenant X removed his clothes and tied the rope to his waist from a point upstream he

721
01:10:01.52 --> 01:10:06.32
plunged in the river and was successful in reaching the hand of one of the men in the human chain

722
01:10:07.12 --> 01:10:12.32
as he was carried downstream by the current as the men in the human chain with the aid of others

723
01:10:12.32 --> 01:10:18.80
on the bank were pulling lieutenant X on the rope ashore an enemy machine gun opened up

724
01:10:18.80 --> 01:10:23.68
from the northwest bank although the rope was eventually secured on the island one man had been killed

725
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:29.12
and five wounded including the battalion commander the wounded were evacuated to the outpost

726
01:10:29.12 --> 01:10:37.84
where the battalion commander died within an hour. Comment although his bravery was commendable

727
01:10:37.84 --> 01:10:42.40
the in invisability of a tying commander participating in a patrol action is obvious.

728
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:50.32
Subsequently, back to the event subsequently the enemy subjected the island to heavy machine gun

729
01:10:50.32 --> 01:10:55.12
and mortar fire however the men on the island this is that little island of the river however the

730
01:10:55.12 --> 01:11:01.20
little island the men in the island stayed in position to cover the crossing of the remaining

731
01:11:01.20 --> 01:11:07.44
17 men on the far bank one of the two wounded men with this group of the 17 was successfully

732
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:11.52
evacuated to the other was swept away and drowned while trying to cross.

733
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:20.000
Of the 15 men only of the 15 remaining men only eight succeeded in getting across the river

734
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.44
before the japs closed in these men said they had been subjected to heavy mortar and grenade fire

735
01:11:25.44 --> 01:11:29.36
and it was believed that the others were killed. It's only eight of them make it.

736
01:11:30.24 --> 01:11:36.16
It is believed that all of the un-injured men in the group could have crossed the river before the

737
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:40.80
enemy closed in on them had they not chosen to stick it out in hopes of getting the wounded

738
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:45.60
across. So there you go these guys were brave they wanted to stay with their friends and they

739
01:11:45.60 --> 01:11:48.96
end up losing just about everybody because they're trying to get these wounded guys across.

740
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:57.68
The comment the patrol cost a difficult obstacle and moved rapidly deep into hostile territory

741
01:11:57.68 --> 01:12:03.20
where the enemy situation was obscure. So start this whole this whole thing. You start off by

742
01:12:03.20 --> 01:12:08.24
going into enemy territory and in order to get into enemy territory you're going across a freaking

743
01:12:08.24 --> 01:12:14.48
river. We better have a damn good plan. We don't know what the enemy situation is up there

744
01:12:15.44 --> 01:12:19.92
and how deep are we going to go? Like you know what you're doing in a situation like that

745
01:12:19.92 --> 01:12:24.000
I call charge you put really good fire support on one side of the river and say,

746
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.20
guys you're going to go go cross go ahead. If something happens we got you. We got mortars we got

747
01:12:29.20 --> 01:12:31.84
heavy machine guns it will be able to get you back. And by the way we're going to put a rope around

748
01:12:31.84 --> 01:12:34.96
the first guy. So when you go across the river some happens we're going to pull you right back.

749
01:12:36.40 --> 01:12:44.96
That's covered move by the way. And then you don't go on a lengthy patrol without good support.

750
01:12:48.72 --> 01:12:52.72
There was apparently very little reconnaissance on the part of the patrol and it was unaware of the

751
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:59.12
enemy strength and the immediate vicinity. The patrol is of sufficient strength to fight its way

752
01:12:59.12 --> 01:13:05.12
out against the superior number of enemy but when control was lost and the patrol was disorganized

753
01:13:05.12 --> 01:13:11.04
and split up it was susceptible to defeat in detail. And just check this out. If you were on

754
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:16.80
patrol with me and you saw me give you a hand signal like to go out set up a bit further push out a

755
01:13:16.80 --> 01:13:22.16
little bit further and you saw another hand signal with me from me there would be no part of your

756
01:13:22.16 --> 01:13:26.08
brain that would be thinking I would be telling you to split forces and go back to base. No part

757
01:13:26.08 --> 01:13:30.16
of your brain would think that you would know that I would that I would want to stick together. You

758
01:13:30.16 --> 01:13:35.04
would know that everyone would know that everyone on the team would think hey the only way we're

759
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:39.92
splitting forces if Jockel comes over and looks at me and says hey we're splitting forces here's

760
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:45.92
the new plan other than that we're sticking together. That's like an implied commanders intent

761
01:13:45.92 --> 01:13:51.76
from me always. We are sticking together. We will cover move for each other for sure but we're not

762
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:56.88
going to get separated where we can't mutually support each other that's not a good thing ever.

763
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:03.68
So what kind of implied intent do you have with your team in your organization that people know

764
01:14:03.68 --> 01:14:12.000
what to do and they won't make mistakes like this? So essentially you're saying like for your

765
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.76
example where that's such a rigid rule that you have and it's established like that's kind of the

766
01:14:19.76 --> 01:14:27.20
Ethan like if if Lave heard me on the radio say that could split force. He wouldn't be like hey

767
01:14:27.20 --> 01:14:30.40
Jockel just told me to split force he back with something something's wrong. Yeah, I can't

768
01:14:30.40 --> 01:14:35.04
he would make sense to him. He'd be like okay hey Jockel say again hey Jockel I'm going to

769
01:14:35.04 --> 01:14:39.60
come and talk to you because if you're still you've never remotely said anything like hey let's split

770
01:14:39.60 --> 01:14:45.92
up and see how we do. Right. Right. Let's get to for me to say hey set up a good cover position.

771
01:14:45.92 --> 01:14:52.80
Cool all day long. Hmm. Provide cover moved to high ground. Any of those things but to say split forces

772
01:14:52.80 --> 01:14:57.76
it would be he would need to he would ask questions right and you're saying that's because

773
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:01.76
there are certain things that are when you see he said implied right but there's certain things that

774
01:15:01.76 --> 01:15:06.64
are just this is what we're starting to let me tell you one of them is cover move. If you get

775
01:15:06.64 --> 01:15:11.36
it's cover move is what I live by it's a first law of combat right. First law of combat is cover

776
01:15:11.36 --> 01:15:16.64
move. If I'm telling you to go away from me we can't cover move anymore and life life here's

777
01:15:16.64 --> 01:15:20.24
that goes away. Second, Jockel doesn't want me to cover move that's crazy something's going on

778
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:25.76
that I need to understand or it's a miscommunication. He's not like oh cool later. No if I

779
01:15:25.76 --> 01:15:30.32
elates one of the principles of combat leadership and it's not going to happen. Hmm.

780
01:15:31.44 --> 01:15:35.28
So what are those principles inside your organization? Do you have them established correctly

781
01:15:35.28 --> 01:15:39.84
that people know what to do and if a weird signal comes through they go away to say what are you

782
01:15:39.84 --> 01:15:45.60
talking about? This doesn't make any sense. You know like Dave Burke gets a request from a client

783
01:15:46.48 --> 01:15:53.28
and he built it. Yeah, you know and I say don't give the client any support. But if you would be

784
01:15:53.28 --> 01:15:57.12
you say wait a second no something's going on here. You know something's not clear there's a

785
01:15:57.12 --> 01:16:01.12
miscommunication because we are here to support our clients we're here to teach them leadership.

786
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.08
We're here to give them all the leadership tools that we can. And Dave knows that implicitly

787
01:16:08.08 --> 01:16:11.76
so if I will say don't give them any support. Wait a second I gotta go talk to Jockel

788
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:16.48
about there's something going on. Yeah kind of like if you lost your temper on somebody it would be like

789
01:16:17.12 --> 01:16:21.68
something would be. If you wouldn't yeah wouldn't compete. Really you'd be like oh that must

790
01:16:21.68 --> 01:16:31.36
be like a demonstration or something you know. Check. Before we jump this next section that section

791
01:16:31.36 --> 01:16:37.68
right there was the section that I kind of wanted to that kind of caught me because it's a very

792
01:16:37.68 --> 01:16:45.20
good debrief of a little you know you read about big battles and we've covered many big battles

793
01:16:45.20 --> 01:16:53.68
and of course we get the gist of the battle we get the experience of battle from one man's vision

794
01:16:54.48 --> 01:17:02.72
but to get it after action debrief like that and you can imagine how this is this is just a one

795
01:17:02.72 --> 01:17:10.32
little tiny example one little tiny example and and that's why when I when I started this thing

796
01:17:10.32 --> 01:17:15.76
often I said you know why do I cover these because I never heard these lessons every freaking

797
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:22.000
military leader should read that after action report where a bunch of guys get killed a bunch of

798
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.88
guys get wounded and why do you just have happened it's so clear why it happens they give you the

799
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:30.88
reasons you have multiple chains of commands you have guys splitting forces there's unclear

800
01:17:30.88 --> 01:17:35.44
communication like you should know these things you should get taught these things

801
01:17:38.80 --> 01:17:43.20
and look what else you're facing out there you got your enemy right what else you got

802
01:17:45.04 --> 01:17:51.12
the river the river oh that's doesn't sound like a big deal but people drowned yeah

803
01:17:51.12 --> 01:17:55.60
this is not this isn't like a little stream this is a river where people drowned

804
01:17:55.60 --> 01:18:02.48
yeah and yeah and that's the kind of the assumption for us outsiders where you know we think

805
01:18:02.48 --> 01:18:07.84
okay they got you know they got this many guys on their side and we got this many guys but we got this

806
01:18:07.84 --> 01:18:12.08
and we got that like we have these tanks we got that you know it's like kind of nuts against nuts

807
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:18.96
kind of a thing but you consider not at all there's there's like we need food we need to get across

808
01:18:18.96 --> 01:18:25.12
that river yeah they're all this stuff that's kind of like jungle I'm just the jungle just getting through

809
01:18:25.12 --> 01:18:30.40
there yeah just what about our weapons they're getting you know sand in them they're getting

810
01:18:30.40 --> 01:18:36.24
water in them there's raining yeah we're we're our feet are rotting we're starving by the way

811
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:41.68
we need water we have this intrigued like what is going on yeah and by the way there's a bunch of

812
01:18:41.68 --> 01:18:49.04
Japanese suicidal fighters that want to kill us all yeah they're never saving private Ryan right

813
01:18:49.04 --> 01:18:56.000
where they kind of you know they they they they they come up on the beach and you know everyone

814
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.08
guys are jumping in the water whatever and then a couple guys they just drowned like it's like you

815
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:05.68
know when you you see that opening shot and you consider it in real life or whatever it's kind

816
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:10.88
of like okay what are we about to get into this is gonna be scary machine guns you know

817
01:19:10.88 --> 01:19:16.88
tricking Germans bombs all this stuff right but then oh wait a second what about the actual water

818
01:19:16.88 --> 01:19:24.56
we have to go through like that's gonna kill some of us and imagine this you go and you make a movie

819
01:19:25.76 --> 01:19:36.72
and you actually go into the horror and panic of each individual that jumps into the water with

820
01:19:36.72 --> 01:19:44.56
64 pounds of gear they're not a great swimmer they go to the bottom panicking fighting and drowning

821
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:51.28
and dying a horrible death and that's happening all over the place on that day and then meanwhile

822
01:19:51.28 --> 01:19:57.44
if you survive if you somehow get your shit together and get your gear off and now you get to

823
01:19:57.44 --> 01:20:05.52
the beach you're getting freaking strafed by enemy elevated bunker machine gun positions

824
01:20:05.52 --> 01:20:16.08
yeah check last section of volume seven is called OP and CP security

825
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:25.12
observation post and command post security this is such a good start it says even at this late date

826
01:20:26.32 --> 01:20:32.88
needless casualties delays and expenditures of effort are being caused by breaches of OP and

827
01:20:32.88 --> 01:20:37.28
security rules so what he's saying is like look we've been fighting this war for three and a half

828
01:20:37.28 --> 01:20:44.96
four years and even right now we have to explain what to do how to maintain security

829
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:50.16
because we're taking unnecessary casualties because people aren't falling the proper protocols

830
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:57.12
the inevitable results of of security carelessness are pointy illustrated by three following incidents

831
01:20:57.12 --> 01:21:07.28
carelessness cost lives cost lives reported by technician fifth grade earnest j-langie

832
01:21:07.28 --> 01:21:14.96
130 fifth infantry we stayed in one CP for two weeks without drawing a shell and it felt quite

833
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:20.64
secure for we had been told that the enemy hadn't been shelling in that particular vicinity

834
01:21:20.64 --> 01:21:29.04
for the past thirty days however a few of the men either forgot or disregarded their instructions

835
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.08
they watched some white towels and shirts and hung them out the dry and effective signal for the

836
01:21:36.08 --> 01:21:44.000
enemy artillery fire upon our command post three of our men were killed in the shelling that followed

837
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:57.68
this breaches security learning security the hard way reported by an infantry battalion commander

838
01:21:59.44 --> 01:22:06.32
after being sheld out of two CP locations the first time with severe casualties we reorganized

839
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:13.20
a sadly depleted CP group and opened for business in another building a third story battalion

840
01:22:13.20 --> 01:22:20.16
OP and the same building could be reached only by passing a large open window on a stair landing

841
01:22:20.16 --> 01:22:26.48
since the entire village was under enemy observation and direct fire it was necessary to crawl

842
01:22:26.48 --> 01:22:34.32
past this open window to ensure that this would be done a century was stationed in the stairway so

843
01:22:34.32 --> 01:22:39.04
there's a window you have to crawl when you go by this window and it's so important that they put

844
01:22:39.04 --> 01:22:46.56
a guy sitting by the window going hey freaking crawl buddy hey you crawl all went well until it was

845
01:22:46.56 --> 01:22:51.12
discovered that the sergeant major had just covered the opening with a large sheet of tin

846
01:22:51.92 --> 01:22:58.32
so that the century could be released for work with the wire team so he needs the century to go do

847
01:22:58.32 --> 01:23:03.36
something else so he says hey just put the speed to tin up against the window this might seem like a

848
01:23:03.36 --> 01:23:13.12
weird question or maybe what's a century guard yeah a guard as opposed to like you could it's

849
01:23:13.12 --> 01:23:20.24
literally a guard is that like a rank like a position or someone like a guard guard tonight so

850
01:23:20.24 --> 01:23:26.24
now you're a century tonight like that you could you could use the word guard and century same word

851
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:33.68
same okay synonym yeah the century might have a little bit more tone of military century as opposed to a

852
01:23:34.88 --> 01:23:42.48
guard of a prison so a centuries more like someone that's standing watch got you so what if you guys are

853
01:23:42.48 --> 01:23:46.64
out on a mission and it's like a two-day mission whatever and then it's like okay someone's got

854
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:52.16
to stand watch and it's jocco and you're a Navy SEAL straight up are you the century for that night

855
01:23:52.16 --> 01:23:57.76
kind of we think we would use the term watch like hey I got watch as opposed to saying hey you're on

856
01:23:57.76 --> 01:24:06.08
century duty in the in the navy you generally call it just watch so even hey who's got like in the

857
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:12.32
barracks I'll be like who's got fire watch or that you have watch because you stand and watch

858
01:24:12.32 --> 01:24:17.76
sections on the ship but technically you're a century but you're well like I said it's it's

859
01:24:17.76 --> 01:24:25.04
leaning towards well we would call century duty even in the in the navy century duty we'd probably

860
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:31.12
just call it watch but in other outfits probably some century yeah let's say you seem to be the

861
01:24:31.12 --> 01:24:38.08
yep okay so and you could put obviously this century was all he was doing was telling people what

862
01:24:38.08 --> 01:24:43.84
do hey get down when you go across that window so he wasn't actually protecting the perimeter

863
01:24:43.84 --> 01:24:51.44
he was protecting the troops from doing something stupid yeah it was a guard in a specific capacity

864
01:24:51.44 --> 01:24:59.52
there you go in the century so they put this big tin sheet up we abandon the CP and hasten

865
01:24:59.52 --> 01:25:04.24
moved to an already established alternate CP the only remaining location in town but last man

866
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:10.40
had hardly left the building before was taken under direct artillery fire and rapidly disintegrated

867
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:17.92
this incident thoroughly impressed our personnel with the folly of signaling OP and CP locations

868
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:23.76
to the enemy by altering the outward appearance of the building after occupancy that particular

869
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:27.44
error was not repeated they I just got lucky that thing and I bet someone was like great

870
01:25:27.44 --> 01:25:31.76
sergeant major what'd you do you put a piece of tin up do we got to get out of here you're an idiot

871
01:25:31.76 --> 01:25:35.68
sergeant major with all due respect you're an idiot and how the enemy knows we're here and we got to

872
01:25:35.68 --> 01:25:46.32
get out of here and the last the last section here one mistake is too many

873
01:25:47.84 --> 01:25:53.84
reported by the commanding general first infantry division officers this one is so important

874
01:25:53.84 --> 01:25:59.76
officers visiting the front line units should be warned against actions that might reveal to the

875
01:25:59.76 --> 01:26:07.28
enemy the locations of our installations in one case an observation post was located in a

876
01:26:07.28 --> 01:26:12.72
wrecked building inside walls of the rooms had been camouflaged to give a dark background

877
01:26:12.72 --> 01:26:18.16
instruments had been set well back in the rooms and observers were careful to move about only in

878
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:26.56
the shadows all went well until the day some visiting officers stopped by they moved about freely

879
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:31.36
even leaning out of the windows and they're with their field glasses with an half an hour

880
01:26:31.36 --> 01:26:35.20
the building was completely destroyed by enemy fire one of our observers was killed

881
01:26:38.64 --> 01:26:43.36
that's the situation when you roll down to the front lines and you think you're just going to be cool

882
01:26:43.36 --> 01:26:46.72
yeah and in my mind I'm thinking I'm not even thinking that they were being stupid

883
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:52.40
because they might just be being stupid but they might also be like hey I'm cool oh

884
01:26:52.40 --> 01:26:57.20
I'm not gonna hide I'm not gonna walk around I'm not gonna hide my shadows

885
01:26:59.20 --> 01:27:02.64
late late late's got a funny story about going to the government center for the first time in

886
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:07.84
downtown Ramadi and they like pulling the humbese and they see marines sprinting from one location to another

887
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:12.88
you know like so they did just do what they were doing and like everything cool like yeah

888
01:27:12.88 --> 01:27:16.08
there's snipers around here you've got to move it you know like Roger that

889
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:27.36
but that that wraps up this this particular volume volume seven and you know that last little

890
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:34.08
section it's these moments these little moments where we slack off where we get complacent just for a minute

891
01:27:35.28 --> 01:27:44.32
just for a minute and that's when we get crushed we can't let that happen we need to always stay

892
01:27:44.32 --> 01:27:52.96
on the path speaking of the path echo Charles is a day as one old record podcast speed

893
01:27:52.96 --> 01:27:59.04
it's good this book handle that some sections that I didn't cover because

894
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:06.32
look I find leadership lessons everywhere but when we're talking about using cable foot

895
01:28:06.32 --> 01:28:12.40
bridge to cross rivers I found a little bit it was really a stretch yeah it was really a stretch

896
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:17.84
I kept it to the leadership principles good so there we go all right how do we how do you stay

897
01:28:17.84 --> 01:28:23.52
on the path well part of this when you know only hear these accounts and go over these field

898
01:28:23.52 --> 01:28:29.04
manuals and learn these lessons from the past from books whatever it is important to even just

899
01:28:29.04 --> 01:28:33.60
remember to pay attention to the lessons because you can get caught up in the story man yeah like I was

900
01:28:33.60 --> 01:28:40.40
kind of concerned about those guys with guys human bridge link chain whatever I was concerned

901
01:28:40.40 --> 01:28:46.64
you know but there is a lesson that if you don't pay attention you might miss it so that's

902
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:52.40
important too so yes we're staying capable for sure we're reading you know listening all that stuff

903
01:28:52.40 --> 01:28:56.88
we are reading I know I'm reading I'm not sure how much reading you're doing right now read

904
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:03.76
either way for staying physically capable as well we're training I'll tell you that

905
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:12.40
nonetheless we've got to keep ourselves healthy and capable that's important I think concur

906
01:29:12.40 --> 01:29:16.08
so yeah so when you're on this path you might need some supplementation it helps

907
01:29:16.64 --> 01:29:21.68
oh it definitely helps yeah big time keep your immunity up keep your functionality up keep your strength

908
01:29:21.68 --> 01:29:29.68
up keep your endurance up keep your cognitive attitude up up yeah we'll be good time let it go down see

909
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:35.52
that's no good for nobody you got people depending on you including yourself so mostly yourself

910
01:29:35.52 --> 01:29:39.68
mostly yourself it's real good be my others I guess we can't have anyone relying on loss if we

911
01:29:39.68 --> 01:29:43.84
can't rely on ourselves that's what I'm saying that's what I'm trying to say what if you're at a

912
01:29:43.84 --> 01:29:49.92
capability two scenarios one you're at a capability health level 10 and then the other scenario

913
01:29:49.92 --> 01:29:57.84
you're at a health capability level five you got let's say two kids depending on you you got

914
01:29:57.84 --> 01:30:04.16
let's say maybe an employee depending on you maybe it has I don't know so someone else depending on you

915
01:30:05.60 --> 01:30:09.44
you want to be level five you want to be level ten let's face it that's not even a really good

916
01:30:09.44 --> 01:30:14.000
question well obviously answer right but that's but that's not the point that I'm making a point

917
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.80
I'm making is some of us we're just like I'm fine with my number five you're not doing

918
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:24.96
nobody no favors by being at number five no at level ten you are doing a lot of people and there's

919
01:30:24.96 --> 01:30:32.32
a weird thing here some people would rather let let themselves down then let other people's down

920
01:30:32.32 --> 01:30:36.64
some people would rather than care about someone else but they would not want to let themselves down

921
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:42.32
either one of those let's not let anyone down let's get that level ten and keep it

922
01:30:42.32 --> 01:30:47.60
see what I'm saying slipping off the path and not getting back onto the path is doing

923
01:30:47.60 --> 01:30:52.96
no good for nobody and you've got people depending on you you got to you got to do the right thing

924
01:30:52.96 --> 01:30:58.000
yeah let's do it all right yeah supplementation is far supplementation goes

925
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.20
jacquoise supplementation jacquo fuels called jacquo fuel jacquo dot com if you want to get it

926
01:31:03.20 --> 01:31:08.56
you have very reliable very high quality stuff this will keep you on the path this will help you

927
01:31:08.56 --> 01:31:14.000
straight up so first thing we will go into is discipline and discipline go supplementation for

928
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.56
your brain and body here's the thing the days of poison energy drinks which is the thing I get it

929
01:31:20.56 --> 01:31:27.36
I get it energy you know this thing but you got other bad stuff in there the days of drinking that

930
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:34.08
can stuff art are gone no no no need nope not anymore it's a big deal now it the when you

931
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:40.08
drink an energy drink now yeah it's good for you it's kind of like a smoke did the desserts right

932
01:31:40.08 --> 01:31:46.88
that's exactly what happened what the desserts is what discipline go does to energy drinks

933
01:31:46.88 --> 01:31:51.52
because let's face it you kind of like the taste of an energy drink you kind of like the fact

934
01:31:51.52 --> 01:31:57.36
that it gets you a little amped what you don't like is you crash what you don't like is it's bad for

935
01:31:57.36 --> 01:32:03.68
you what you don't like is it you get that freaking jitters and what you don't like is you're giving

936
01:32:03.68 --> 01:32:10.16
yourself type two diabetes which also sucks that there's no reason for any that no it's like dessert

937
01:32:10.16 --> 01:32:17.36
you know you you you feel like crap after you eat a big whatever if we can horrible dessert filled

938
01:32:17.36 --> 01:32:25.04
with sugar you know you just have milk yeah easy money yeah you you pay an additional cost for

939
01:32:25.04 --> 01:32:30.24
drinking an energy drink in a traditional sense you want to hear a non-traditional use of

940
01:32:30.24 --> 01:32:40.000
milk that I've been doing so I used to go to this restaurant and they did this thing called

941
01:32:40.24 --> 01:32:45.52
dessert shots have you heard this concept it's just a really small dessert yeah but it's kind of

942
01:32:45.52 --> 01:32:51.76
cool because let's face it you get done with a piece of big prime rib and a Caesar salad and you're

943
01:32:51.76 --> 01:32:57.12
kind of stoked but then you think I kind of want something sweet too but I don't want to get everything

944
01:32:57.12 --> 01:33:01.92
you know whatever big giant dessert so I'm just going to get myself a little

945
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:06.08
little Sunday shot at this particular restaurant I used to go to back in the day which

946
01:33:06.08 --> 01:33:11.60
is close now unfortunately because it was a damn good restaurant me my wife used to go there

947
01:33:11.60 --> 01:33:18.08
and stone or would come like he would just show up with the third wheel just coming get it hang out

948
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:25.52
all the time like every time but lately I've been doing like the same thing but I've

949
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:30.24
been doing shots of moments just maybe a little bit bigger than a shot but just enough where you're like

950
01:33:30.24 --> 01:33:35.92
yeah you know like yeah that would work I think now I'll just keep a monk mixed up in the fridge

951
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:44.48
oh yeah and just pour a little shot and just get a little hitter mix in some like dark chocolate chunks

952
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:48.88
you need to get the like the smell of it on that yeah you put that in the shot so you like hit it

953
01:33:48.88 --> 01:33:54.08
and you can jump up the the dark chocolate and do a hitter nice I'm telling because those gourmet

954
01:33:54.08 --> 01:33:58.24
those dessert shots or whatever yeah I heard that you can get a little tray of them or whatever and

955
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:02.56
it's like yeah one's like a little cup of brownie or something they're just small right so you're

956
01:34:02.56 --> 01:34:07.20
saying so yeah you want to spice it up make it more like gourmet and lavish yeah let me tell you

957
01:34:07.20 --> 01:34:13.68
chocolate yeah I'm here to have a look at how bad it is also don't worry about the days of worrying

958
01:34:13.68 --> 01:34:19.36
about your joints just acting up those days are going to they are yeah I'm telling you stay on

959
01:34:19.36 --> 01:34:24.88

960

961
01:34:30.56 --> 01:34:35.04

01:34:35.04 --> 01:34:42.000
sick little scratchy throw whatever however you get sick you're gonna be you're gonna notice it

963

1011
01:39:36.08 --> 01:39:40.64
to Dean about getting some of those back online warrior kid podcast as well you can also join us

1012

1013
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:53.04
podcast we've been talking about a bunch of wild things on there things that are not quite

1014
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:58.24
jockel podcast material but they're adjacent material amplifying material we've talked about a bunch

1015
01:39:58.24 --> 01:40:03.76
of psychology we talk about group dynamics we do talk about leadership we talk about and we and we

1016
01:40:03.76 --> 01:40:09.52
be doing Q and A on there as well so the reason we have that is because we don't know what's going

1017
01:40:09.52 --> 01:40:14.08
to happen with all of these platforms that we're on and we did get we did get some is it called

1018
01:40:14.08 --> 01:40:19.84
censorship we we get fully censored but we got some some warnings on one of the last podcast that we

1019
01:40:19.84 --> 01:40:26.96
did about the Armenian genocide so who knows we we can't I know I do know you know who knows I

1020
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:33.84
know I know I know that we can't leave ourselves at the whim of someone having control over what we do

1021
01:40:33.84 --> 01:40:39.20
so we created another platform at jockel underground dot com and if you want to help us build

1022
01:40:39.20 --> 01:40:44.56
and maintain that platform it's eight dollars and eighteen cents a month there's some layers

1023
01:40:44.56 --> 01:40:48.96
behind that but if you want to help us out then do that and you can get this other podcast called

1024
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:54.80
jockel underground you can ask questions and that also prevents us from having to interject

1037
01:42:09.92 --> 01:42:15.44
it kind of like under values really what it is telling you so some people listen to music

1045
01:42:55.28 --> 01:43:00.32
to get it to say first edition and I know there's there's legal requirements about that page

1046
01:43:00.32 --> 01:43:03.20
you know it's like copyright stuff so I don't know if I'm going to be able to get away with it but

1047
01:43:03.20 --> 01:43:08.64
we're going to try and at a minimum it's going to say first edition it might even say first edition

1048

I'm reading it and I'm freaking loving reading it I'm like and I get the same thing I used to have

1052
01:43:32.56 --> 01:43:38.56
this with the way the warrior kid where I'm reading it and I kind of forget that I wrote it because

1053
01:43:38.56 --> 01:43:43.04
it's fiction so I didn't live it where you know when I'm reading the extreme ownership or leadership

1054
01:43:43.04 --> 01:43:50.64

1055
01:43:51.44 --> 01:43:56.80
it's a story right that's in my head that's almost a different part of my brain I look it's

1056
01:43:56.80 --> 01:44:01.44
obvious I think it's real obvious that it's me that wrote it you know I was on the

1057
01:44:01.44 --> 01:44:07.36
Lex free you know Lex freedman yeah I just I just said a podcast with him and he said that I speak

01:44:14.48 --> 01:44:21.68
hear a Russian person speak English you know send location like that kind of thing he says that

1060
01:44:21.68 --> 01:44:30.56
