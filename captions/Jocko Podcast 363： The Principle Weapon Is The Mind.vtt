00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.28
This is Jocko podcast number 363 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.28 --> 00:00:05.32
Jocko willing.

3
00:00:05.32 --> 00:00:06.16
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:06.16 --> 00:00:07.44
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:10.68
All commanders should consider the professional development

6
00:00:10.68 --> 00:00:11.96
of their subordinates,

7
00:00:11.96 --> 00:00:14.28
a principal responsibility of command.

8
00:00:15.76 --> 00:00:18.20
Commanders should foster a personal,

9
00:00:18.20 --> 00:00:21.68
personal teacher-student relationship

10
00:00:21.68 --> 00:00:23.76
with their subordinates.

11
00:00:23.76 --> 00:00:25.24
Commanders are expected to conduct

12
00:00:25.24 --> 00:00:27.88
a continuing professional education program

13
00:00:27.88 --> 00:00:29.000
for their subordinates,

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.44
which includes developing military judgment

15
00:00:31.44 --> 00:00:32.40
and decision making

16
00:00:32.40 --> 00:00:34.92
and teaches general professional subjects

17
00:00:34.92 --> 00:00:37.32
and specific technical subjects pertinent

18
00:00:37.32 --> 00:00:39.60
to occupational specialties.

19
00:00:40.76 --> 00:00:44.60
Useful tools for general professional development

20
00:00:44.60 --> 00:00:47.20
include supervised reading programs,

21
00:00:47.20 --> 00:00:50.000
map exercises, war games,

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.16
battle studies and terrain studies.

23
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:56.76
Commanders should see the development

24
00:00:56.76 --> 00:01:01.36
of their subordinates as a direct reflection of themselves.

25
00:01:02.24 --> 00:01:07.24
Finally, every Marine has a basic responsibility

26
00:01:07.24 --> 00:01:10.94
to study the profession of arms on his own.

27
00:01:12.12 --> 00:01:15.04
A leader without either interest in

28
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:17.36
or knowledge of the history,

29
00:01:17.36 --> 00:01:18.84
the theory of warfare

30
00:01:18.84 --> 00:01:22.40
and the intellectual content of his profession

31
00:01:22.40 --> 00:01:27.12
is a leader in appearance only.

32
00:01:27.12 --> 00:01:31.16
Self-study in the art and science of war

33
00:01:31.16 --> 00:01:33.96
is at least equal in importance

34
00:01:33.96 --> 00:01:36.04
and should receive equal time

35
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:38.12
to maintaining physical condition.

36
00:01:39.80 --> 00:01:42.84
This is particularly true among officers.

37
00:01:42.84 --> 00:01:47.84
After all, an officer's principal weapon is his mind.

38
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:52.84
And that right there is a little excerpt

39
00:01:54.60 --> 00:01:59.60
from the Fleet Marine Force Manual One, War Fighting,

40
00:02:01.68 --> 00:02:04.44
a book that was commissioned by General Al Gray,

41
00:02:04.44 --> 00:02:06.88
the 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps

42
00:02:06.88 --> 00:02:09.96
and one of the most iconic Commandants of the Marine Corps.

43
00:02:09.96 --> 00:02:11.12
It's one of the first manuals

44
00:02:11.12 --> 00:02:13.18
that we covered on this podcast.

45
00:02:13.18 --> 00:02:17.34
And what that excerpt describes

46
00:02:17.34 --> 00:02:21.78
is an approach that I have tried to take to study war,

47
00:02:21.78 --> 00:02:24.66
to study history, the theory of war,

48
00:02:24.66 --> 00:02:27.34
the history of war, the profession of war

49
00:02:28.34 --> 00:02:31.22
and I've met some folks along the way

50
00:02:31.22 --> 00:02:36.22
who are also enthralled by the study of history and warfare

51
00:02:36.70 --> 00:02:38.86
and one of the most knowledgeable

52
00:02:38.86 --> 00:02:41.70
that I've met is here with us tonight.

53
00:02:41.70 --> 00:02:45.46
His name is JD, Judd JD Baker.

54
00:02:45.46 --> 00:02:48.22
He served in the Marine Corps for 21 years

55
00:02:49.14 --> 00:02:51.54
as an infantryman, a sniper, drill instructor,

56
00:02:51.54 --> 00:02:55.62
senior enlisted advisor in a bunch of different billets,

57
00:02:55.62 --> 00:02:58.06
deployed to war zones around the world

58
00:02:58.06 --> 00:03:01.86
and he's here with us tonight to share his experiences

59
00:03:01.86 --> 00:03:06.06
and lessons learned with us, JD.

60
00:03:06.06 --> 00:03:07.86
Thanks for coming by, man.

61
00:03:07.86 --> 00:03:09.10
Thanks for having me on.

62
00:03:09.10 --> 00:03:11.94
Let's get into it, man.

63
00:03:11.94 --> 00:03:15.66
You've got so much knowledge that I wanna squeeze out of you

64
00:03:15.66 --> 00:03:18.02
and we'll get to the end where we'll talk about

65
00:03:18.02 --> 00:03:19.82
how I plan to squeeze knowledge out of you.

66
00:03:19.82 --> 00:03:22.98
I got a whole campaign plan on how to do that.

67
00:03:22.98 --> 00:03:25.62
But let's talk about you, where you came from,

68
00:03:25.62 --> 00:03:26.46
how you grew up.

69
00:03:26.46 --> 00:03:27.70
So when were you born?

70
00:03:28.82 --> 00:03:31.26
69, March 8th, 1969.

71
00:03:31.26 --> 00:03:33.02
And where?

72
00:03:33.02 --> 00:03:37.10
Huntington, West Virginia, right on the higher river

73
00:03:37.10 --> 00:03:38.94
down on the southeastern side.

74
00:03:38.94 --> 00:03:42.02
So you could basically swim to Ohio and walk to Kentucky.

75
00:03:43.02 --> 00:03:45.26
That's a pretty good triathlon right there, huh?

76
00:03:45.26 --> 00:03:46.10
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:03:46.10 --> 00:03:47.22
The three state triathlon.

78
00:03:47.22 --> 00:03:49.62
So what's your mom and dad do?

79
00:03:49.62 --> 00:03:51.50
My mom was a stay at home.

80
00:03:51.50 --> 00:03:55.06
My dad, he worked for a nickel plant,

81
00:03:55.06 --> 00:03:58.30
big industrial kind of area down there on the river,

82
00:03:58.30 --> 00:04:00.74
you know, West Virginia, coal, nickel,

83
00:04:00.74 --> 00:04:01.74
all that kind of stuff.

84
00:04:01.74 --> 00:04:03.54
And my dad hated his job.

85
00:04:05.14 --> 00:04:08.26
You had to suit and tie, go into work every day,

86
00:04:08.26 --> 00:04:10.30
same kind of deal.

87
00:04:10.30 --> 00:04:14.38
And all he wanted to do was scout major league baseball.

88
00:04:14.38 --> 00:04:16.94
So he put applications out all over the place,

89
00:04:16.94 --> 00:04:18.82
got picked up by the Pittsburgh Pirates,

90
00:04:18.82 --> 00:04:22.18
and got to live out the rest of his life,

91
00:04:22.18 --> 00:04:23.06
scoutin' baseball.

92
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:26.34
Did he quit his job at the nickel plant?

93
00:04:26.34 --> 00:04:29.14
He just put in enough time to get retirement,

94
00:04:29.14 --> 00:04:31.46
like as soon as like early retirement.

95
00:04:31.46 --> 00:04:32.62
So it was kind of like in the military,

96
00:04:32.62 --> 00:04:34.06
you just do the 20 years.

97
00:04:34.06 --> 00:04:35.62
What is he putting on his application

98
00:04:35.62 --> 00:04:37.66
to become a major league scout?

99
00:04:37.66 --> 00:04:39.14
I mean, don't you have to spend like time

100
00:04:39.14 --> 00:04:40.78
looking at high schools, then maybe you get

101
00:04:40.78 --> 00:04:43.02
a community college, then you go to a regular college,

102
00:04:43.02 --> 00:04:47.42
then you get to go to be a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

103
00:04:47.42 --> 00:04:49.38
That's a big jump out of the gate, isn't it?

104
00:04:49.38 --> 00:04:51.30
Yeah, it's a pretty big jump.

105
00:04:51.30 --> 00:04:54.18
My dad played college ball at Marshall.

106
00:04:54.18 --> 00:04:55.82
So he played a little bit of college ball,

107
00:04:55.82 --> 00:04:57.82
and you know, in our household,

108
00:04:57.82 --> 00:05:02.02
if it wasn't white with little red stitches on it,

109
00:05:02.02 --> 00:05:05.10
my dad didn't give two shits about it.

110
00:05:05.10 --> 00:05:07.46
So basically we were raised in a dugout,

111
00:05:07.46 --> 00:05:10.42
which was super cool for kids growing up

112
00:05:10.42 --> 00:05:12.62
with me and my older brother.

113
00:05:12.62 --> 00:05:14.50
So it was strictly baseball.

114
00:05:14.50 --> 00:05:17.86
He coached baseball, never like coached us

115
00:05:17.86 --> 00:05:19.18
while we were playing Little League.

116
00:05:19.18 --> 00:05:21.54
My dad coached Babe Ruth,

117
00:05:21.54 --> 00:05:24.02
he coached some of the travel teams, stuff like that.

118
00:05:24.02 --> 00:05:27.02
Was he smart enough to realize that he shouldn't coach you?

119
00:05:28.26 --> 00:05:30.46
He didn't like little kids.

120
00:05:30.46 --> 00:05:32.26
Okay, that'll do it too.

121
00:05:32.26 --> 00:05:33.10
You know what I mean?

122
00:05:33.10 --> 00:05:34.66
Like he didn't want to be the one out there,

123
00:05:34.66 --> 00:05:36.78
like you know, clapping for little Johnny

124
00:05:36.78 --> 00:05:39.66
and Susie telling them they're doing a great job.

125
00:05:39.66 --> 00:05:40.50
You know what I mean?

126
00:05:40.50 --> 00:05:42.90
He wanted to like to elevate, you know,

127
00:05:42.90 --> 00:05:45.06
kids that are 13 and above,

128
00:05:45.06 --> 00:05:48.38
they kind of know that they know the basics of the game.

129
00:05:48.38 --> 00:05:50.70
Was he doing like weird, subliminal stuff to you

130
00:05:50.70 --> 00:05:52.30
when you were little to like,

131
00:05:52.30 --> 00:05:55.42
was he like throwing the apple to you?

132
00:05:55.42 --> 00:05:57.86
Like, oh, hey, hey, Judd, you want an apple?

133
00:05:57.86 --> 00:05:58.86
Like toss it to you real quick,

134
00:05:58.86 --> 00:06:00.82
we gotta catch it to work on your hand, I ask you.

135
00:06:00.82 --> 00:06:02.10
I feel like I did that with my kids.

136
00:06:02.10 --> 00:06:05.10
I was doing all this weird kind of like things.

137
00:06:05.10 --> 00:06:09.54
Well, the funny thing is, is like both myself and my brother,

138
00:06:09.54 --> 00:06:12.90
we throw right, but we bat left.

139
00:06:12.90 --> 00:06:16.42
And I don't remember ever,

140
00:06:16.42 --> 00:06:17.94
like it's kind of like learning to swim.

141
00:06:17.94 --> 00:06:21.50
Like I don't remember when I learned to swim.

142
00:06:21.50 --> 00:06:24.70
And I don't remember learning how to swing a bat,

143
00:06:24.70 --> 00:06:28.50
but both my brother and I both bat left-handed,

144
00:06:28.50 --> 00:06:30.50
because in baseball you have an advantage.

145
00:06:30.50 --> 00:06:33.34
You're already facing first when you get done swinging.

146
00:06:33.34 --> 00:06:34.98
So you've got to drop.

147
00:06:34.98 --> 00:06:37.14
You can get the first base faster.

148
00:06:37.14 --> 00:06:37.98
So it was like-

149
00:06:37.98 --> 00:06:38.82
That's the kind of thing right there.

150
00:06:38.82 --> 00:06:40.42
I bet your dad was like, no, no, no,

151
00:06:40.42 --> 00:06:43.86
you need to stand over here, buddy, stand over here.

152
00:06:43.86 --> 00:06:44.78
Right.

153
00:06:44.78 --> 00:06:47.42
So yeah, it was all that with baseball.

154
00:06:47.42 --> 00:06:49.90
And of course as a kid, we loved the game.

155
00:06:50.86 --> 00:06:54.14
You know, we played other sports as well, but baseball was-

156
00:06:54.14 --> 00:06:55.46
What other sports did you play?

157
00:06:55.46 --> 00:06:57.86
We played soccer, we played basketball.

158
00:06:57.86 --> 00:07:00.38
We played a little bit of football, but not as much.

159
00:07:00.38 --> 00:07:03.46
It was mainly, it was baseball.

160
00:07:03.46 --> 00:07:07.22
Now, you played the other sports all the way through high school,

161
00:07:07.22 --> 00:07:09.54
or at some point did we focus and just go like,

162
00:07:09.54 --> 00:07:11.98
it's baseball, baseball, and baseball?

163
00:07:11.98 --> 00:07:14.02
It was pretty much like, you know,

164
00:07:14.02 --> 00:07:16.90
soccer was mainly for the running aspect,

165
00:07:16.90 --> 00:07:19.74
to be prepared for baseball season.

166
00:07:19.74 --> 00:07:22.38
Like everything came off of baseball.

167
00:07:22.38 --> 00:07:25.74
You know, basketball, my brother wrestled,

168
00:07:25.74 --> 00:07:29.34
because he wasn't coordinated enough to play basketball.

169
00:07:29.34 --> 00:07:33.22
So he wrestled, you know, I played basketball,

170
00:07:33.22 --> 00:07:34.06
I loved the game.

171
00:07:34.06 --> 00:07:37.06
Just a little thing here for the wrestlers out there.

172
00:07:37.06 --> 00:07:38.66
I gotta say this, Jeremy Stevens,

173
00:07:38.66 --> 00:07:41.74
you know, he's an MMA fighter and a great dude,

174
00:07:41.74 --> 00:07:44.62
but he wrestled in Iowa, you know, in high school and stuff.

175
00:07:44.62 --> 00:07:47.98
And one of their insults they would say,

176
00:07:47.98 --> 00:07:50.82
if someone came in, if they wrestled against a guy,

177
00:07:50.82 --> 00:07:52.94
or someone that was in the wrestling room,

178
00:07:52.94 --> 00:07:54.18
they'd be like, oh, how was that guy?

179
00:07:54.18 --> 00:07:56.62
He said, oh, he felt like a basketball player,

180
00:07:56.62 --> 00:07:58.14
meaning just like weak.

181
00:07:59.14 --> 00:08:01.34
So when you say, I just gotta throw that out there

182
00:08:01.34 --> 00:08:03.74
for the wrestlers, because I can't let it go unchecked,

183
00:08:03.74 --> 00:08:05.98
that you're like too not coordinated enough

184
00:08:05.98 --> 00:08:06.82
to play basketball.

185
00:08:06.82 --> 00:08:07.86
So we wrestled and said,

186
00:08:07.86 --> 00:08:11.06
so I gotta give some props to my wrestlers out there.

187
00:08:11.06 --> 00:08:13.90
Yeah, my brother on the wrestling team, you know,

188
00:08:13.90 --> 00:08:16.06
of course, my older brother, and of course,

189
00:08:16.06 --> 00:08:18.54
his wrestling friends would all come over to the house

190
00:08:18.54 --> 00:08:21.26
and wanna put the basketball player

191
00:08:21.26 --> 00:08:23.10
into a pretzel in the middle of a family room

192
00:08:23.10 --> 00:08:24.70
on a daily basis.

193
00:08:25.70 --> 00:08:27.10
The only thing I liked about it was

194
00:08:27.10 --> 00:08:29.90
when we sat at the dinner table, you know,

195
00:08:29.90 --> 00:08:31.02
I didn't have to cut weight.

196
00:08:31.02 --> 00:08:31.86
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:31.86 --> 00:08:35.82
And my brother is over there, just like lettuce,

198
00:08:35.82 --> 00:08:37.26
just shaking the water off,

199
00:08:37.26 --> 00:08:39.70
and I've got like a big thing, a pasta,

200
00:08:39.70 --> 00:08:43.14
and just, you know, just wolfing it down.

201
00:08:43.14 --> 00:08:46.22
So I always felt bad, you know,

202
00:08:46.22 --> 00:08:48.10
for my brother and those aspects,

203
00:08:48.10 --> 00:08:51.62
but wrestling was huge in West Virginia,

204
00:08:51.62 --> 00:08:52.94
you know, at Huntington High,

205
00:08:52.94 --> 00:08:54.26
where we went to school,

206
00:08:54.26 --> 00:08:57.54
Coach Archer, legendary All-American wrestler

207
00:08:57.54 --> 00:08:59.34
coming out of there.

208
00:08:59.34 --> 00:09:01.34
We had some other Ken Zefalato guys,

209
00:09:01.34 --> 00:09:02.74
you know, wrestle Pan-An game.

210
00:09:02.74 --> 00:09:04.18
I mean, wrestling was huge,

211
00:09:04.18 --> 00:09:07.78
so it was a real big deal,

212
00:09:07.78 --> 00:09:09.30
but I was just thankful enough

213
00:09:09.30 --> 00:09:12.10
that I didn't have to like cut weight.

214
00:09:12.10 --> 00:09:16.38
And, you know, and the wrestling practices were just brutal.

215
00:09:16.38 --> 00:09:17.58
My brother would come by,

216
00:09:17.58 --> 00:09:18.58
I mean, basketball practice,

217
00:09:18.58 --> 00:09:21.10
he'd go shoot some hoop man, play a little one-on-one.

218
00:09:21.10 --> 00:09:21.94
You know what I mean?

219
00:09:21.94 --> 00:09:24.38
It was like nothing demanding.

220
00:09:24.38 --> 00:09:25.22
You know what I mean?

221
00:09:25.22 --> 00:09:26.06
You were a little, you know,

222
00:09:26.06 --> 00:09:28.18
back then in the 70s, those, you know, tube socks

223
00:09:28.18 --> 00:09:30.42
all the way up, little cute shorts, man.

224
00:09:30.42 --> 00:09:32.94
Yeah, little short shorts, put on a tank top, man.

225
00:09:32.94 --> 00:09:33.94
That's what we're doing.

226
00:09:33.94 --> 00:09:35.94
Yeah, you know, watch Larry Bird,

227
00:09:35.94 --> 00:09:37.70
Magic Johnson kind of stuff,

228
00:09:37.70 --> 00:09:39.30
but yeah, you played basketball.

229
00:09:39.30 --> 00:09:42.02
So, yeah, I always, yeah, the wrestlers,

230
00:09:42.02 --> 00:09:44.38
that was next level, you know.

231
00:09:44.38 --> 00:09:48.38
So did you, did you play three sports in high school then?

232
00:09:48.38 --> 00:09:50.18
Or did you at some point just play baseball?

233
00:09:50.18 --> 00:09:52.34
Yeah, it ended up just being baseball.

234
00:09:52.34 --> 00:09:54.30
Your dad's plan came together.

235
00:09:54.30 --> 00:09:55.74
Yeah, and the other-

236
00:09:55.74 --> 00:09:56.78
What position did you play?

237
00:09:56.78 --> 00:09:58.34
I was a pitcher.

238
00:09:58.34 --> 00:09:59.38
How tall are you?

239
00:09:59.38 --> 00:10:00.50
Six foot three.

240
00:10:00.50 --> 00:10:03.74
I went and talked to the Padres a few years ago.

241
00:10:03.74 --> 00:10:06.94
And, you know, I don't really follow baseball super close.

242
00:10:06.94 --> 00:10:07.78
But when I was growing up,

243
00:10:07.78 --> 00:10:09.62
it seemed like everyone that played baseball

244
00:10:09.62 --> 00:10:12.42
was like a little Dominican dude

245
00:10:12.42 --> 00:10:15.90
or a little Puerto Rican dude, you know, like little guys.

246
00:10:15.90 --> 00:10:17.34
And I went and talked to the Padres.

247
00:10:17.34 --> 00:10:22.22
Every one of those guys was a freaking giant human, giant.

248
00:10:22.22 --> 00:10:24.42
And I was like, oh, I guess it's a huge advantage.

249
00:10:24.42 --> 00:10:25.62
I guess it's coming back now

250
00:10:25.62 --> 00:10:26.70
where they got some smaller players,

251
00:10:26.70 --> 00:10:28.30
but it's a huge advantage, right?

252
00:10:28.30 --> 00:10:30.54
To be a pitcher and be six three.

253
00:10:30.54 --> 00:10:31.74
Oh yeah.

254
00:10:31.74 --> 00:10:33.94
And, you know, I started out as a kid.

255
00:10:33.94 --> 00:10:37.50
I think I was eight years old for my birthday.

256
00:10:37.50 --> 00:10:39.70
You know, we didn't make a big deal out of birthdays.

257
00:10:39.70 --> 00:10:41.38
We just, you know, running a mom and dad's room

258
00:10:41.38 --> 00:10:43.26
on your birthday and they'd have a present for you.

259
00:10:43.26 --> 00:10:44.98
And mom was a catcher's met.

260
00:10:44.98 --> 00:10:46.26
Cause they thought, you know, my dad was like,

261
00:10:46.26 --> 00:10:47.78
okay, he's going to be the short one.

262
00:10:47.78 --> 00:10:49.50
So he'll be the catcher.

263
00:10:49.50 --> 00:10:50.34
You know what I mean?

264
00:10:50.34 --> 00:10:52.62
My older brother, Tommy, he's going to be the tall one.

265
00:10:52.62 --> 00:10:53.54
So he'll be the pitcher.

266
00:10:53.54 --> 00:10:54.74
My dad was a pitcher.

267
00:10:54.74 --> 00:10:56.38
He's six foot three.

268
00:10:56.38 --> 00:10:58.02
He was a big guy.

269
00:10:58.02 --> 00:11:01.46
I mean, not like big unit kind of guy, that big,

270
00:11:01.46 --> 00:11:03.02
you know, six, seven, six, nine,

271
00:11:03.02 --> 00:11:06.90
but then at like 10 years old,

272
00:11:06.90 --> 00:11:11.06
my brother quit growing and I kept growing.

273
00:11:11.06 --> 00:11:12.82
So then we, we reversed.

274
00:11:12.82 --> 00:11:15.02
We just traded myths.

275
00:11:15.02 --> 00:11:16.70
So then my brother became a catcher,

276
00:11:16.70 --> 00:11:18.10
which I was thankful for.

277
00:11:18.10 --> 00:11:21.18
Cause again, as you can kind of see with like, you know,

278
00:11:21.18 --> 00:11:23.94
the basketball aspect, a catcher is a,

279
00:11:23.94 --> 00:11:26.62
that's a brutal, brutal job.

280
00:11:27.70 --> 00:11:30.10
You know, I mean, but you control the field.

281
00:11:30.10 --> 00:11:31.50
You're the leader.

282
00:11:31.50 --> 00:11:34.22
You're the only one that can see all eight players

283
00:11:34.22 --> 00:11:37.06
at one time, but you know, being a catcher,

284
00:11:37.06 --> 00:11:39.34
just, you know, hot, sweaty behind the plate.

285
00:11:39.34 --> 00:11:43.06
You're engaged in every play out there.

286
00:11:43.06 --> 00:11:44.34
And my brother was really good.

287
00:11:44.34 --> 00:11:48.10
My brother was a really good baseball player as a catcher.

288
00:11:48.10 --> 00:11:50.06
And then for me, being a pitcher,

289
00:11:50.06 --> 00:11:51.74
you're kind of like the, you know,

290
00:11:51.74 --> 00:11:53.74
like a basketball player compared to a wrestler.

291
00:11:53.74 --> 00:11:57.14
You're the, you know, you got to take care of the pitcher.

292
00:11:57.14 --> 00:11:58.14
And you know what I mean?

293
00:11:58.14 --> 00:12:02.02
He's, you know, he's special kind of aspect of it.

294
00:12:02.02 --> 00:12:06.62
So I didn't get beat up as much as my brother did.

295
00:12:06.62 --> 00:12:07.46
And how about school?

296
00:12:07.46 --> 00:12:08.30
Are you doing all right in school

297
00:12:08.30 --> 00:12:09.78
as far as like grades and everything?

298
00:12:09.78 --> 00:12:10.62
Do you care?

299
00:12:10.62 --> 00:12:11.66
Is it like no big deal?

300
00:12:11.66 --> 00:12:12.82
Are you getting into trouble?

301
00:12:12.82 --> 00:12:15.02
What's going on with your, just your youth?

302
00:12:15.02 --> 00:12:16.18
Yeah.

303
00:12:16.18 --> 00:12:20.10
School pretty much get terrible.

304
00:12:20.10 --> 00:12:21.66
Just, just terrible.

305
00:12:21.66 --> 00:12:26.66
The coolest thing in school was in the first grade.

306
00:12:28.02 --> 00:12:30.90
My first grade teacher was Mrs. Goheen.

307
00:12:32.02 --> 00:12:34.02
And Mrs. Goheen, cool thing about it is

308
00:12:34.02 --> 00:12:36.14
I'm friends with her on Facebook, even still today,

309
00:12:36.14 --> 00:12:38.02
which is like super cool with social media

310
00:12:38.02 --> 00:12:39.94
to be friends with Ms. Goheen.

311
00:12:39.94 --> 00:12:42.58
And she made us do a book report.

312
00:12:42.58 --> 00:12:45.14
And probably the biggest impact she had on me was

313
00:12:45.14 --> 00:12:47.50
she let you pick whatever book.

314
00:12:47.50 --> 00:12:51.06
She didn't like assign a book to make us read

315
00:12:51.06 --> 00:12:51.98
something specific.

316
00:12:51.98 --> 00:12:54.22
You got to pick whatever you wanted.

317
00:12:54.22 --> 00:12:57.26
Me, I did my first book report on Babe Ruth

318
00:12:57.26 --> 00:12:58.38
with the New York Yankees.

319
00:12:58.38 --> 00:13:01.94
Obviously we had a lot of baseball books in the house,

320
00:13:01.94 --> 00:13:05.26
just laying around everywhere.

321
00:13:05.26 --> 00:13:07.94
So she allowed me to write my first book report

322
00:13:07.94 --> 00:13:11.66
and then just to have a love of reading.

323
00:13:11.66 --> 00:13:14.66
It doesn't matter what you read, just read.

324
00:13:14.66 --> 00:13:19.10
So after that, I always enjoyed reading as a kid.

325
00:13:19.10 --> 00:13:24.10
But I love gym class, I liked recess, I like to play.

326
00:13:24.46 --> 00:13:27.02
I mean, whatever the game is, it doesn't matter.

327
00:13:27.02 --> 00:13:28.74
I enjoyed playing a game.

328
00:13:28.74 --> 00:13:33.50
And my dad was always pretty, he was pretty liberal

329
00:13:33.50 --> 00:13:37.10
with the aspects of boys will be boys kind of aspect.

330
00:13:37.10 --> 00:13:39.26
But my dad was a mathematician.

331
00:13:39.26 --> 00:13:41.46
So he loved math.

332
00:13:41.46 --> 00:13:43.18
And I'm the complete opposite.

333
00:13:43.18 --> 00:13:45.14
I don't like math.

334
00:13:45.14 --> 00:13:47.86
I'd rather the liberal arts, the history,

335
00:13:47.86 --> 00:13:49.66
the reading, the books and stuff.

336
00:13:49.66 --> 00:13:53.30
So, we kept enough to play sports.

337
00:13:53.30 --> 00:13:55.74
So you got to have a 2.0 to play ball.

338
00:13:55.74 --> 00:13:57.54
So as long as you were above a 2.0,

339
00:13:57.54 --> 00:13:59.46
my dad was like, well, I'm good with that.

340
00:13:59.46 --> 00:14:00.78
You know what I mean?

341
00:14:00.78 --> 00:14:03.78
I wasn't an honor society or holding candles,

342
00:14:03.78 --> 00:14:05.82
having photos taken in school.

343
00:14:06.74 --> 00:14:10.10
But I had a lot of fun, great childhood.

344
00:14:10.10 --> 00:14:14.50
You got an A in recess, lunch, gym class and fun.

345
00:14:14.50 --> 00:14:15.34
I like that.

346
00:14:15.34 --> 00:14:19.66
I knocked it out the park in all those areas.

347
00:14:19.66 --> 00:14:23.82
And then where I grew up, probably another big aspect

348
00:14:23.82 --> 00:14:26.90
of my life was at eight years old,

349
00:14:26.90 --> 00:14:28.50
my dad sent me to camp.

350
00:14:29.38 --> 00:14:31.06
Now, this is a camp.

351
00:14:31.06 --> 00:14:33.18
It's called Camp Walla-Watula.

352
00:14:33.18 --> 00:14:36.74
And it's in Milborough Springs, Virginia, Bath County

353
00:14:36.74 --> 00:14:38.54
on the Cal Pasture River.

354
00:14:38.54 --> 00:14:41.02
My dad went to this camp.

355
00:14:41.02 --> 00:14:43.22
And it's kind of like Hogsworth,

356
00:14:43.22 --> 00:14:45.74
and like the Harry Potter stuff where they would take us

357
00:14:45.74 --> 00:14:47.34
to the train station in Huntington.

358
00:14:47.34 --> 00:14:51.06
You'd have your big luggage,

359
00:14:52.14 --> 00:14:53.98
and you'd get on a train,

360
00:14:53.98 --> 00:14:57.74
and we would take the train to Clifton Forge, Virginia.

361
00:14:57.74 --> 00:15:02.10
And the counselors would pick us up from the train,

362
00:15:02.10 --> 00:15:04.22
throw all of our luggage in there and take us out

363
00:15:04.22 --> 00:15:06.70
to Camp Walla-Watula on the Cal Pasture River

364
00:15:06.70 --> 00:15:09.58
for seven weeks, living in tents.

365
00:15:09.58 --> 00:15:13.66
And it was like, I loved camp.

366
00:15:14.82 --> 00:15:17.30
Huntington, you'd shot 22 rifles,

367
00:15:17.30 --> 00:15:22.02
you shot bow and arrow, canoeing, swimming, horsebacking,

368
00:15:22.02 --> 00:15:25.14
oran tearing, leaf identifications,

369
00:15:25.14 --> 00:15:27.46
not tying, all these kind of things.

370
00:15:27.46 --> 00:15:30.34
And it was at Camp Walla-Watula,

371
00:15:30.34 --> 00:15:33.18
and I had to beg my parents to go at eight years old

372
00:15:33.18 --> 00:15:34.90
because normally you had to go when you were nine,

373
00:15:34.90 --> 00:15:36.66
but my older brother went.

374
00:15:36.66 --> 00:15:38.62
And when we went to go pick up my brother,

375
00:15:38.62 --> 00:15:42.78
and I got to see this camp, I was like, oh, this is it.

376
00:15:42.78 --> 00:15:46.62
Like, so we would spend seven weeks every summer

377
00:15:46.62 --> 00:15:49.62
on the Cal Pasture River at camp,

378
00:15:49.62 --> 00:15:53.02
which had a huge effect on the rest of my life.

379
00:15:53.02 --> 00:15:56.54
I mean, going into the Marine Corps was like going to camp.

380
00:15:56.54 --> 00:15:57.82
You know what I mean?

381
00:15:57.82 --> 00:16:00.98
I mean, you join the infantry, going to camp,

382
00:16:00.98 --> 00:16:01.82
you got activities.

383
00:16:01.82 --> 00:16:05.94
So you did that every year for, like until you were how old?

384
00:16:05.94 --> 00:16:09.06
Until I was 14, and then Don Sutton,

385
00:16:09.06 --> 00:16:10.98
the family that owned the camp that had,

386
00:16:10.98 --> 00:16:12.98
like I said, my dad went to that camp.

387
00:16:14.82 --> 00:16:18.98
He had two sons and nobody wanted to take the camp over.

388
00:16:18.98 --> 00:16:20.90
So they basically shut the camp down,

389
00:16:20.90 --> 00:16:24.38
but every June, we have a reunion

390
00:16:24.38 --> 00:16:27.02
with all the guys at Camp Walla-Watula.

391
00:16:27.02 --> 00:16:30.14
The sad thing is, is like, I'm one of the youngest

392
00:16:30.14 --> 00:16:32.30
of the reunion guys.

393
00:16:32.30 --> 00:16:35.06
And we go back every June,

394
00:16:35.06 --> 00:16:37.74
but being at camp with the counselors,

395
00:16:37.74 --> 00:16:42.74
and they had a big effect on me as a kid growing up of like,

396
00:16:44.26 --> 00:16:48.02
I mean, you sat at tables, they taught you manners,

397
00:16:48.02 --> 00:16:50.82
how to eat, how to take care of yourself,

398
00:16:50.82 --> 00:16:52.62
basically how to be a Virginia.

399
00:16:53.70 --> 00:16:57.42
And every, at the three week mark,

400
00:16:57.42 --> 00:16:59.58
they would take us into Lexington, Virginia.

401
00:17:00.62 --> 00:17:04.90
VMI's there, and then they've got the Robert E. Lee tomb is there.

402
00:17:04.90 --> 00:17:07.06
So we would go visit Robert E. Lee.

403
00:17:07.06 --> 00:17:10.74
So like at the first time at eight years old,

404
00:17:10.74 --> 00:17:12.98
I remember seeing the Robert E. Lee,

405
00:17:12.98 --> 00:17:17.58
Stonewall Jackson, Virginia, all that Washington,

406
00:17:18.74 --> 00:17:21.86
Virginia in history is huge.

407
00:17:21.86 --> 00:17:25.98
And at camp, we had mandatory like nap time,

408
00:17:25.98 --> 00:17:27.10
after lunch, you'd come back.

409
00:17:27.10 --> 00:17:29.78
And it was like reading, reading, laying rack,

410
00:17:29.78 --> 00:17:30.62
kind of an event.

411
00:17:30.62 --> 00:17:34.30
So you could bring a book, you could write letters home,

412
00:17:34.30 --> 00:17:36.30
the letter writing really didn't go very well.

413
00:17:36.30 --> 00:17:38.18
I think my mom still has the first letter I wrote,

414
00:17:38.18 --> 00:17:41.82
and it was like, dear mom and dad having a good Judd.

415
00:17:41.82 --> 00:17:44.58
And that was it, you know what I mean?

416
00:17:45.86 --> 00:17:50.86
But yeah, that aspect of growing up and seeing mentorship

417
00:17:51.70 --> 00:17:54.14
of like the counselors that came into the camp,

418
00:17:54.14 --> 00:17:57.30
and they mentored us at a very early age,

419
00:17:57.30 --> 00:18:00.66
and seeing kind of like what Wright looked like

420
00:18:00.66 --> 00:18:05.22
for growing into becoming a man was a huge, huge aspect.

421
00:18:05.22 --> 00:18:07.86
That was an all boy camp, all boys.

422
00:18:07.86 --> 00:18:10.66
Yep, there was an all girls camp right down the river

423
00:18:10.66 --> 00:18:13.18
called Camp Montchanadoa, still exists today.

424
00:18:14.18 --> 00:18:17.18
And we would do like a dance with them and stuff.

425
00:18:17.18 --> 00:18:20.86
We'd go up river and go there,

426
00:18:22.02 --> 00:18:25.30
nice to see young girls at a camp.

427
00:18:26.54 --> 00:18:30.18
So it was fun, but yeah, I mean,

428
00:18:30.18 --> 00:18:32.58
the Cowpasture River is a part of my life.

429
00:18:32.58 --> 00:18:34.14
I mean, I've got, when I die,

430
00:18:34.14 --> 00:18:37.06
I want to be cremated, my ashes dumped in the Cowpasture.

431
00:18:38.18 --> 00:18:40.82
We go every year, I mean, I love the plate.

432
00:18:40.82 --> 00:18:44.42
My wife and I, Tracy, we were married in the Cowpasture River,

433
00:18:44.42 --> 00:18:46.30
like standing in the river.

434
00:18:47.18 --> 00:18:49.94
Yeah, that's a huge tie to me,

435
00:18:49.94 --> 00:18:51.90
is that river and that part of my life.

436
00:18:51.90 --> 00:18:54.14
How far is that river from where you grew up?

437
00:18:55.82 --> 00:18:58.34
Probably about three and a half hours,

438
00:18:58.34 --> 00:19:01.14
three and a half hours, four hours just over the Appalachia.

439
00:19:01.14 --> 00:19:05.70
It's on the Virginia, West Virginia border

440
00:19:05.70 --> 00:19:09.50
in Bath County, Virginia, up in the mountains up there.

441
00:19:09.50 --> 00:19:10.94
Beautiful part.

442
00:19:10.94 --> 00:19:14.74
So were you on track to like go to college

443
00:19:14.74 --> 00:19:15.74
and play baseball?

444
00:19:15.74 --> 00:19:16.78
Were you good enough?

445
00:19:16.78 --> 00:19:19.02
Were you like, what was going on with that?

446
00:19:19.02 --> 00:19:22.94
Well, you know, the good thing is I had my older brother

447
00:19:22.94 --> 00:19:25.70
and so I could kind of like watch what he did

448
00:19:25.70 --> 00:19:29.10
and see his mistakes and try not to repeat,

449
00:19:29.10 --> 00:19:31.58
because you gotta go home and deal with my dad.

450
00:19:31.58 --> 00:19:34.14
So my brother went to WVU, you know what I mean?

451
00:19:34.14 --> 00:19:36.18
He was gonna try the college thing

452
00:19:36.18 --> 00:19:40.50
and my brother was a lot smarter than I was.

453
00:19:42.58 --> 00:19:44.66
But still, he couldn't figure out

454
00:19:44.66 --> 00:19:47.50
that you have to go to class to like get a grade.

455
00:19:48.74 --> 00:19:50.74
Did he get recruited for baseball?

456
00:19:50.74 --> 00:19:51.94
Was he playing baseball there?

457
00:19:51.94 --> 00:19:53.26
No, no, no.

458
00:19:53.26 --> 00:19:54.10
He just went.

459
00:19:54.10 --> 00:19:55.74
Yeah, he was just going to college.

460
00:19:55.74 --> 00:19:57.78
So despite the efforts of your dad

461
00:19:57.78 --> 00:20:00.02
to turn you guys into baseball players

462
00:20:00.02 --> 00:20:04.34
that could play in college, he didn't play in college.

463
00:20:04.34 --> 00:20:09.06
No, and with my dad's aspect of,

464
00:20:09.06 --> 00:20:12.06
he more or less looked at it on the aspects

465
00:20:12.06 --> 00:20:15.22
of try to go straight farm league.

466
00:20:15.22 --> 00:20:19.06
Like, I would say that my dad,

467
00:20:19.06 --> 00:20:21.78
he kind of looked at it like you can always go to college.

468
00:20:21.78 --> 00:20:23.58
You can be 60 years old, man.

469
00:20:23.58 --> 00:20:24.82
You can go to college.

470
00:20:24.82 --> 00:20:27.54
You get one shot to play pro ball.

471
00:20:27.54 --> 00:20:29.10
And you know what I mean?

472
00:20:29.10 --> 00:20:32.42
And you try to get in, if you can get minor league

473
00:20:32.42 --> 00:20:35.14
kind of aspects, he always worried about

474
00:20:35.14 --> 00:20:37.98
like a college coach, you know what I mean?

475
00:20:37.98 --> 00:20:39.98
Of their pedigree.

476
00:20:39.98 --> 00:20:43.42
I mean, they can ruin, they can ruin a guy

477
00:20:43.42 --> 00:20:46.06
because in college, college coach, he's there to win.

478
00:20:46.06 --> 00:20:47.58
He's gonna throw you, he's gonna work you

479
00:20:47.58 --> 00:20:50.62
as much as possible because that's his job.

480
00:20:50.62 --> 00:20:53.34
And college baseball isn't necessarily

481
00:20:53.34 --> 00:20:55.46
like a big thing like college football.

482
00:20:55.46 --> 00:20:58.50
I mean, to play pro football, you gotta go to college.

483
00:20:58.50 --> 00:20:59.82
You gotta play college ball.

484
00:20:59.82 --> 00:21:03.02
You're not gonna go direct to where like baseball

485
00:21:03.02 --> 00:21:06.66
is more of a direct, you know, the Derek Jeter's,

486
00:21:06.66 --> 00:21:08.46
the Griffys, those kind of guys.

487
00:21:08.46 --> 00:21:09.42
You don't go to college.

488
00:21:09.42 --> 00:21:11.10
You go straight to the minor leagues

489
00:21:11.10 --> 00:21:13.26
and then you work your way through the minors.

490
00:21:13.26 --> 00:21:15.50
So that was more of, I would say my dad's

491
00:21:15.50 --> 00:21:17.78
kind of take on things was.

492
00:21:17.78 --> 00:21:19.66
But your brother decided to go to college.

493
00:21:19.66 --> 00:21:21.58
Yeah, he was gonna go to college.

494
00:21:21.58 --> 00:21:24.14
Again, my brother was really, he was good in school.

495
00:21:24.14 --> 00:21:26.34
My brother was a lot smarter than I was.

496
00:21:26.34 --> 00:21:29.62
He paid attention a lot more than I did.

497
00:21:29.62 --> 00:21:32.70
So he went to WVU, but like I said,

498
00:21:32.70 --> 00:21:34.78
he didn't go to class much.

499
00:21:34.78 --> 00:21:37.10
You know, college football games were great on Saturday

500
00:21:37.10 --> 00:21:37.94
kind of thing.

501
00:21:37.94 --> 00:21:40.38
I'd go up and hang out with my brother.

502
00:21:40.38 --> 00:21:44.34
And then he ended up, you know, not making the grades

503
00:21:44.34 --> 00:21:49.22
and they're like, yeah, you can't stay at school here anymore.

504
00:21:49.22 --> 00:21:52.18
So my brother, he joined the Air Force.

505
00:21:52.18 --> 00:21:53.38
He's like, yeah, well, you know,

506
00:21:53.38 --> 00:21:56.34
dad's like, yeah, not, you don't wanna hang out

507
00:21:56.34 --> 00:21:57.18
in the house here.

508
00:21:57.18 --> 00:21:58.02
Let's come back.

509
00:21:58.02 --> 00:21:59.38
So my brother joined the Air Force.

510
00:21:59.38 --> 00:22:01.46
And when he joined the Air Force,

511
00:22:01.46 --> 00:22:05.22
he was a worked on C-130s, crew chief stuff with C-130s.

512
00:22:05.22 --> 00:22:07.38
He was out of Dias, Texas.

513
00:22:07.38 --> 00:22:09.38
I mean, it seemed like a pretty good gig

514
00:22:09.38 --> 00:22:11.62
for what he was doing.

515
00:22:11.62 --> 00:22:15.34
And then for me, you know, when I was 17,

516
00:22:15.34 --> 00:22:17.54
I played on a couple of travel teams.

517
00:22:17.54 --> 00:22:21.06
And we were playing in Cincinnati.

518
00:22:21.06 --> 00:22:25.02
And, you know, regardless of my dad,

519
00:22:25.02 --> 00:22:27.06
I mean, I love my dad to death.

520
00:22:27.06 --> 00:22:28.90
But, you know, his nickname,

521
00:22:28.90 --> 00:22:30.38
yeah, between like me and my brother,

522
00:22:30.38 --> 00:22:32.14
and then we called him the dick.

523
00:22:34.62 --> 00:22:35.58
And love him to death.

524
00:22:35.58 --> 00:22:37.54
But I mean, you know, all my friends were like,

525
00:22:37.54 --> 00:22:39.54
dude, it must be so cool having like, you know,

526
00:22:39.54 --> 00:22:41.62
cause my dad's nickname was T-Bone.

527
00:22:41.62 --> 00:22:43.38
So they were like, dude, it's like so cool.

528
00:22:43.38 --> 00:22:45.10
Like, you know, your dad T-Bone.

529
00:22:45.10 --> 00:22:46.58
Cause everybody thought my dad was great.

530
00:22:46.58 --> 00:22:47.42
You know what I mean?

531
00:22:47.42 --> 00:22:49.22
Cause at all the games, you know,

532
00:22:49.22 --> 00:22:51.34
whether it was football, basketball, you name it.

533
00:22:51.34 --> 00:22:52.74
I mean, why did they call him T-Bone?

534
00:22:52.74 --> 00:22:54.10
Just cause his name Tom Baker.

535
00:22:54.10 --> 00:22:56.38
And he was, you know, six foot three, you know,

536
00:22:56.38 --> 00:22:58.58
hundred and, you know, 55 pounds.

537
00:22:58.58 --> 00:23:02.10
He looked like just a T-Bone coming off of a stake.

538
00:23:02.10 --> 00:23:03.94
And so they called him T-Bone.

539
00:23:03.94 --> 00:23:05.34
And everybody thought it was like the coolest thing.

540
00:23:05.34 --> 00:23:06.54
Well, it's like, well, dude,

541
00:23:06.54 --> 00:23:08.42
you didn't live with my dad.

542
00:23:08.42 --> 00:23:11.78
Like, of course he's cool outside of the house,

543
00:23:11.78 --> 00:23:14.94
but step into the house and live with this guy.

544
00:23:14.94 --> 00:23:17.50
I mean, and again, it was still, it was great.

545
00:23:18.58 --> 00:23:22.30
But, you know, my dad was, I mean, he was funny, humorous,

546
00:23:22.30 --> 00:23:26.06
you know, but yeah, I loved him to death, but he,

547
00:23:26.06 --> 00:23:30.26
we came back from playing in Cincinnati, Ohio.

548
00:23:30.26 --> 00:23:32.70
And, you know, I was throwing in a game.

549
00:23:32.70 --> 00:23:35.22
You know, my dad and I kind of got into it a little bit

550
00:23:35.22 --> 00:23:37.06
at the game.

551
00:23:37.06 --> 00:23:39.14
And I was like, I'm done.

552
00:23:39.14 --> 00:23:39.98
You know what I mean?

553
00:23:39.98 --> 00:23:40.82
I'm done.

554
00:23:40.82 --> 00:23:42.26
I came back.

555
00:23:42.26 --> 00:23:44.18
Went straight up 17.

556
00:23:44.18 --> 00:23:46.50
Went to the Marine Corps recruiting office.

557
00:23:46.50 --> 00:23:48.10
How'd you hear about the Marine Corps?

558
00:23:48.10 --> 00:23:50.02
I had a buddy of mine.

559
00:23:50.02 --> 00:23:53.34
Actually, I had quite a few friends of mine of our class.

560
00:23:53.34 --> 00:23:55.82
It was a lot that went in the Marine Corps.

561
00:23:55.82 --> 00:23:57.70
Rick Schenck was one of them.

562
00:23:57.70 --> 00:23:59.98
His dad was a Korean, Vietnam vet.

563
00:23:59.98 --> 00:24:02.18
He was an Army Ranger guy.

564
00:24:02.18 --> 00:24:03.82
But, you know, there was a lot of us

565
00:24:03.82 --> 00:24:08.32
that had looked at the military in a blue collar town

566
00:24:08.32 --> 00:24:09.94
like Huntington.

567
00:24:09.94 --> 00:24:11.34
It's a way out.

568
00:24:11.34 --> 00:24:12.18
You know what I mean?

569
00:24:12.18 --> 00:24:15.70
There's a lot of folks that joined the military to get out.

570
00:24:15.70 --> 00:24:17.02
You know what I mean?

571
00:24:17.02 --> 00:24:19.94
There's something bigger out there.

572
00:24:19.94 --> 00:24:23.54
And again, like I said, I loved camp.

573
00:24:23.54 --> 00:24:25.74
And, you know, I don't have to like...

574
00:24:25.74 --> 00:24:28.38
Those recruiters, man, they were licking their chops

575
00:24:28.38 --> 00:24:29.22
when you showed up.

576
00:24:29.22 --> 00:24:30.06
Oh, I was an idiot.

577
00:24:30.06 --> 00:24:31.22
They're like, oh, you like camp?

578
00:24:31.22 --> 00:24:32.42
We got camp for you, son.

579
00:24:32.42 --> 00:24:33.66
Yeah, I mean, I love camp.

580
00:24:33.66 --> 00:24:34.50
Yeah.

581
00:24:34.50 --> 00:24:36.86
Yeah, and they've got activities.

582
00:24:36.86 --> 00:24:37.70
Tents.

583
00:24:37.70 --> 00:24:38.78
They got tents.

584
00:24:38.78 --> 00:24:42.26
They give you all this free stuff, you get a gun.

585
00:24:43.46 --> 00:24:45.50
So yeah, I mean, I was like, oh, you know,

586
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:47.18
when I came in there, I was like, you know,

587
00:24:47.18 --> 00:24:48.22
telling them to recruit, I was like,

588
00:24:48.22 --> 00:24:50.62
hey, I've got to be infantry.

589
00:24:50.62 --> 00:24:52.62
And, you know, and he's giving us the look like,

590
00:24:52.62 --> 00:24:54.66
oh, that's going to be a difficult one to get.

591
00:24:54.66 --> 00:24:56.34
You know what I mean?

592
00:24:56.34 --> 00:24:58.90
Because we didn't really know a lot.

593
00:24:58.90 --> 00:25:01.30
And, you know, and of course I can get you,

594
00:25:01.30 --> 00:25:04.10
you know, guaranteed, you know, infantry.

595
00:25:04.10 --> 00:25:05.78
You know, if you score high enough.

596
00:25:05.78 --> 00:25:06.62
He's taking care of you.

597
00:25:06.62 --> 00:25:08.86
Yeah, I'm thinking like this guy's the heat.

598
00:25:08.86 --> 00:25:12.46
Like he's hooking us up until I go to boot camp.

599
00:25:12.46 --> 00:25:13.30
You know what I mean?

600
00:25:13.30 --> 00:25:15.50
But then I'm 17, so I got to get a signature.

601
00:25:15.50 --> 00:25:18.34
So, so you're 17, you're 17.

602
00:25:18.34 --> 00:25:19.74
Are you done with high school?

603
00:25:19.74 --> 00:25:21.50
No, no, no, I still have my senior year to go.

604
00:25:21.50 --> 00:25:22.86
So I was like delayed entry.

605
00:25:22.86 --> 00:25:23.70
Okay.

606
00:25:23.70 --> 00:25:24.94
But I had to get my mom to sign.

607
00:25:24.94 --> 00:25:25.78
Uh-huh.

608
00:25:25.78 --> 00:25:26.74
And what mama say?

609
00:25:26.74 --> 00:25:27.66
Mom was all about.

610
00:25:27.66 --> 00:25:29.58
She's down for the cause.

611
00:25:29.58 --> 00:25:31.42
Just give me that paper.

612
00:25:31.42 --> 00:25:33.18
Let me get my signature out of here.

613
00:25:33.18 --> 00:25:34.22
Yeah.

614
00:25:34.22 --> 00:25:36.66
Yeah, why even waste your time?

615
00:25:36.66 --> 00:25:37.50
Yeah.

616
00:25:37.50 --> 00:25:39.82
Which was, you know, when you look back at like,

617
00:25:39.82 --> 00:25:42.78
at life of like a decision that you made,

618
00:25:42.78 --> 00:25:46.98
that was probably the smartest decision I ever made.

619
00:25:46.98 --> 00:25:48.26
Cause I would have been a shit show.

620
00:25:48.26 --> 00:25:49.10
For sure.

621
00:25:49.10 --> 00:25:50.42
Oh, I'm right there with you.

622
00:25:50.42 --> 00:25:51.26
Yeah.

623
00:25:51.26 --> 00:25:53.02
Thanks, thanks to my recruiter.

624
00:25:53.02 --> 00:25:55.26
I can't, I don't even remember anything about my recruiter.

625
00:25:55.26 --> 00:25:56.98
But I just would like to thank him.

626
00:25:56.98 --> 00:25:58.14
Even though he probably screwed me over.

627
00:25:58.14 --> 00:25:59.26
He's like, oh yeah, you're going to go

628
00:25:59.26 --> 00:26:00.10
into the SEAL team?

629
00:26:00.10 --> 00:26:00.94
Sure, buddy.

630
00:26:00.94 --> 00:26:03.58
Yeah, you look, oh yeah, you're going to make

631
00:26:03.58 --> 00:26:05.34
a great SEAL, right?

632
00:26:05.34 --> 00:26:07.34
That's bullshit.

633
00:26:07.34 --> 00:26:09.74
Like there's no way any recruiter knows

634
00:26:09.74 --> 00:26:12.34
if anyone has the remotest chance of making a, yeah.

635
00:26:12.34 --> 00:26:13.94
SEAL teams, you seem like the kind of guy

636
00:26:13.94 --> 00:26:14.82
that's going to do great there.

637
00:26:14.82 --> 00:26:16.46
It's like, yep, just sign this piece of paper.

638
00:26:16.46 --> 00:26:17.30
Sounds great.

639
00:26:17.30 --> 00:26:19.26
You know, recruiter or sir?

640
00:26:19.26 --> 00:26:20.66
So those guys are definitely hooking you up.

641
00:26:20.66 --> 00:26:23.14
But like, that's the same with me.

642
00:26:23.14 --> 00:26:25.94
That the greatest thing, probably like you said,

643
00:26:25.94 --> 00:26:29.50
the single pivot point of the trajectory of my life

644
00:26:29.50 --> 00:26:32.26
was signing that piece of paper and saying, yep, I'm in.

645
00:26:32.26 --> 00:26:34.30
And I remember, I signed up for six years.

646
00:26:34.30 --> 00:26:38.46
It was six years to get a SEAL, to get a BUDDS contract

647
00:26:38.46 --> 00:26:39.86
where you go to BUDDS.

648
00:26:39.86 --> 00:26:41.74
Actually all it was, actually all it was

649
00:26:41.74 --> 00:26:44.46
was you sign up for six years and that gives you a chance

650
00:26:44.46 --> 00:26:46.66
to take the screening test to possibly pass,

651
00:26:46.66 --> 00:26:47.58
to possibly go to BUDDS.

652
00:26:47.58 --> 00:26:48.78
That's what it was.

653
00:26:48.78 --> 00:26:51.94
And you know, you're thinking you're 18 years old.

654
00:26:51.94 --> 00:26:55.22
Like six years is a long, that's one third of your life.

655
00:26:55.22 --> 00:26:57.06
And I remember just thinking, well, whatever.

656
00:26:57.06 --> 00:26:59.54
Well, rock and roll, let's do this.

657
00:26:59.54 --> 00:27:01.22
But definitely a pivot point.

658
00:27:01.22 --> 00:27:05.94
That's interesting because they got me on the six year.

659
00:27:05.94 --> 00:27:07.18
But they gave you infantry?

660
00:27:07.18 --> 00:27:10.34
Yeah, I mean, guaranteed infantry.

661
00:27:10.34 --> 00:27:11.42
Guarantee.

662
00:27:11.42 --> 00:27:13.74
I wonder how many bonus points he got for that,

663
00:27:13.74 --> 00:27:15.42
that they're recruiting.

664
00:27:15.42 --> 00:27:19.90
So you roll in there, you enlist, now you're in.

665
00:27:19.90 --> 00:27:21.82
You have to go to debt meetings your whole senior year

666
00:27:21.82 --> 00:27:23.10
of high school or something like that?

667
00:27:23.10 --> 00:27:23.94
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:27:23.94 --> 00:27:27.50
We kind of meet on the weekends and go for runs

669
00:27:27.50 --> 00:27:28.34
and stuff like that.

670
00:27:28.34 --> 00:27:30.50
So basically, my senior year was,

671
00:27:30.50 --> 00:27:33.58
I mean, I think I took like four gym classes.

672
00:27:33.58 --> 00:27:37.02
You know, because I was like, okay, I'm done.

673
00:27:37.02 --> 00:27:39.22
Like this is what I'm gonna do.

674
00:27:39.22 --> 00:27:41.34
So why do I need to, and of course-

675
00:27:41.34 --> 00:27:42.82
Did you even play baseball your senior year?

676
00:27:42.82 --> 00:27:44.30
No, I quit everything.

677
00:27:44.30 --> 00:27:47.86
I mean, my dad was not happy.

678
00:27:47.86 --> 00:27:48.70
I was gonna say.

679
00:27:48.70 --> 00:27:53.42
Yeah, it was, but you know, he looked at it as,

680
00:27:53.42 --> 00:27:57.66
I don't think my dad was like a big fan of me

681
00:27:57.66 --> 00:28:01.08
making that decision of going in the Marines.

682
00:28:02.86 --> 00:28:06.98
But, you know, I mean, when I remember he took me down there

683
00:28:06.98 --> 00:28:08.66
to the recruiting office to drop me off,

684
00:28:08.66 --> 00:28:11.82
because I shipped like three days after graduation.

685
00:28:11.82 --> 00:28:14.50
Like the recruiter was standing at the graduation.

686
00:28:14.50 --> 00:28:17.10
So when I walked across and I got the piece of paper,

687
00:28:17.10 --> 00:28:19.66
you know, they gotta like take it to make copies.

688
00:28:19.66 --> 00:28:20.50
Yeah, he's there.

689
00:28:20.50 --> 00:28:21.34
Oh, he's there.

690
00:28:21.34 --> 00:28:22.18
But yeah.

691
00:28:22.18 --> 00:28:23.78
We get this in the Xerox machine, son.

692
00:28:23.78 --> 00:28:25.86
Well, the funny thing is, there's like six other

693
00:28:25.86 --> 00:28:28.02
of my classmates that are just as stupid as me,

694
00:28:28.02 --> 00:28:29.62
and we're all going to boot camp together.

695
00:28:29.62 --> 00:28:32.06
Which kind of made it fun.

696
00:28:32.06 --> 00:28:34.34
Yeah, so I had like Ricky Shank and Carrie Nessle

697
00:28:34.34 --> 00:28:37.74
are like literally in the same recruit platoon as me.

698
00:28:37.74 --> 00:28:38.58
Don't kid him.

699
00:28:38.58 --> 00:28:41.18
Yeah, so it was kind of fun to where,

700
00:28:41.18 --> 00:28:43.66
when you're seeing the drill instructor kind of,

701
00:28:43.66 --> 00:28:45.94
you know, give them a ration and you're over there

702
00:28:45.94 --> 00:28:48.26
trying not to laugh, but like what's going on

703
00:28:48.26 --> 00:28:49.98
and then they're doing the same thing to you.

704
00:28:49.98 --> 00:28:52.62
So it was kind of nice.

705
00:28:52.62 --> 00:28:54.22
Like I said, it was kind of like going to camp.

706
00:28:54.22 --> 00:28:55.86
You know what I mean? I had some of my friends there

707
00:28:55.86 --> 00:28:59.02
that I'd known since, you know, I grew up with them.

708
00:28:59.98 --> 00:29:02.82
And there was a, you know, so it was cool to have,

709
00:29:02.82 --> 00:29:04.66
you know, a couple of guys that I went to school with

710
00:29:04.66 --> 00:29:08.30
and ran around with a lot in my recruit platoon.

711
00:29:09.18 --> 00:29:11.82
But I didn't realize like, and we were all guaranteed

712
00:29:11.82 --> 00:29:13.46
infantry by the way.

713
00:29:13.46 --> 00:29:15.18
I mean, you know, they don't make them smart

714
00:29:15.18 --> 00:29:17.46
coming out of Huntington West Virginia.

715
00:29:17.46 --> 00:29:20.38
And the recruiter is probably just, you know, he's loving it.

716
00:29:20.38 --> 00:29:24.46
So until we like, they're announcing

717
00:29:24.46 --> 00:29:27.82
like your military MOS at the end, you know,

718
00:29:27.82 --> 00:29:29.30
the senior drill instructor stand up there.

719
00:29:29.30 --> 00:29:32.06
He's like, you know, Baker infantry, you know what I mean?

720
00:29:32.06 --> 00:29:35.78
He's like, guaranteed boy, you're some kind of stupid.

721
00:29:35.78 --> 00:29:37.10
You know what I mean?

722
00:29:37.10 --> 00:29:39.86
But, you know, back then like, I didn't really know

723
00:29:39.86 --> 00:29:44.38
that like there was other jobs like in the Marines.

724
00:29:44.38 --> 00:29:46.82
Cause I knew like, you know, Navy dock, you know,

725
00:29:46.82 --> 00:29:49.10
we get a lot of our stuff from the Navy.

726
00:29:49.10 --> 00:29:50.82
You know, I thought like everybody

727
00:29:50.82 --> 00:29:52.94
went in the Marine Corps to be infantry.

728
00:29:52.94 --> 00:29:55.70
And, you know, and then you got cooks.

729
00:29:55.70 --> 00:29:58.26
Every Marine rifleman to you is the facts.

730
00:29:58.26 --> 00:29:59.22
You can't say.

731
00:29:59.22 --> 00:30:00.06
Yeah.

732
00:30:00.06 --> 00:30:00.90
Is it everybody?

733
00:30:00.90 --> 00:30:02.10
How was boot camp when you showed up?

734
00:30:02.10 --> 00:30:03.26
Was it like a shocker?

735
00:30:03.26 --> 00:30:04.94
Were you like, holy shit?

736
00:30:05.86 --> 00:30:08.78
Or were you just like, hey, camp, let's do this?

737
00:30:08.78 --> 00:30:09.62
Yeah.

738
00:30:09.62 --> 00:30:12.46
Of course, you know, the shock and all of, you know,

739
00:30:12.46 --> 00:30:15.38
when they bring in, I went to Paris Island.

740
00:30:15.38 --> 00:30:20.14
When I flew out of the Huntington, it's the Tri-State

741
00:30:20.14 --> 00:30:21.66
airport of what they call it.

742
00:30:21.66 --> 00:30:25.50
And that was the first time I had ever been to an airport.

743
00:30:25.50 --> 00:30:28.62
And I don't know, you know, the history of Huntington,

744
00:30:28.62 --> 00:30:31.34
of Marshall University, you might have seen the We Are

745
00:30:31.34 --> 00:30:36.34
Marshall, the 1970 plane crash, the NCAA history,

746
00:30:36.58 --> 00:30:38.66
you know, most fatalities.

747
00:30:39.90 --> 00:30:41.74
And that was at that airport.

748
00:30:41.74 --> 00:30:45.22
So where I grew up, the whole Marshall University

749
00:30:45.22 --> 00:30:48.02
in that plane crash, November 14th, 1970,

750
00:30:49.22 --> 00:30:51.90
you know, every year in Huntington.

751
00:30:51.90 --> 00:30:56.90
I mean, it's a big deal for that Marshall plane crash.

752
00:30:56.98 --> 00:30:59.62
I had, you know, kids that I went to school with

753
00:30:59.62 --> 00:31:02.66
that, you know, their parents were on that plane.

754
00:31:03.98 --> 00:31:07.06
You know, it devastated the community in Huntington.

755
00:31:07.06 --> 00:31:10.74
And then here I am going to the airport, you know,

756
00:31:10.74 --> 00:31:13.30
and I was like, by the way, why can't we just like

757
00:31:13.30 --> 00:31:15.74
take a bus, it's South Carolina, man.

758
00:31:15.74 --> 00:31:16.58
You know what I mean?

759
00:31:16.58 --> 00:31:18.42
Like, can we just, so it was one of those props

760
00:31:18.42 --> 00:31:21.58
that's got like the little curtain that the, you know,

761
00:31:21.58 --> 00:31:24.86
the pilot like puts luggage on and then he takes the curtain

762
00:31:24.86 --> 00:31:26.98
and whips it over there to the side.

763
00:31:26.98 --> 00:31:27.82
And you know what I mean?

764
00:31:27.82 --> 00:31:32.34
And that almost stopped me from going to boot camp.

765
00:31:32.34 --> 00:31:34.22
I mean, I was like, this is ridiculous, man.

766
00:31:34.22 --> 00:31:35.90
Why are we flying?

767
00:31:35.90 --> 00:31:39.14
And so I got down there and then they bring in at night.

768
00:31:39.14 --> 00:31:42.22
You know, so you don't really know like where you're going.

769
00:31:42.22 --> 00:31:44.26
And it's, you know, coming on to Paris Island.

770
00:31:44.26 --> 00:31:47.18
And of course you hear all the mystique of Paris Island.

771
00:31:47.18 --> 00:31:48.98
And of course you remember Full Metal Jacket.

772
00:31:48.98 --> 00:31:51.98
It just came out when you and I were in high school.

773
00:31:51.98 --> 00:31:55.34
So of course, you know, that dude's like a stamina comic.

774
00:31:55.34 --> 00:31:56.18
You know what I mean?

775
00:31:56.18 --> 00:31:57.70
That movie was hilarious.

776
00:31:57.70 --> 00:31:58.70
You know what I mean?

777
00:31:58.70 --> 00:32:03.46
And I'd probably say that with the drill instructors are,

778
00:32:03.46 --> 00:32:05.42
they're stand up comics.

779
00:32:05.42 --> 00:32:08.22
I mean, some of the stuff that they do is just,

780
00:32:08.22 --> 00:32:11.58
it's Saturday Night Live, but it's like 18 hours

781
00:32:11.58 --> 00:32:12.90
of Saturday Night Live a day.

782
00:32:12.90 --> 00:32:16.30
And you're getting the end of the joke.

783
00:32:16.30 --> 00:32:17.30
You're the butt of all the jokes.

784
00:32:17.30 --> 00:32:19.34
Yeah, you're the butt of all the jokes.

785
00:32:19.34 --> 00:32:22.18
But it was still, it was a, it was, you know, the shock

786
00:32:22.18 --> 00:32:24.34
and all, but then once we kind of got into the rhythm

787
00:32:24.34 --> 00:32:28.94
of boot camp, then, you know, with the drill instructors.

788
00:32:28.94 --> 00:32:29.78
What year is this?

789
00:32:29.78 --> 00:32:30.62
Is this 87?

790
00:32:30.62 --> 00:32:31.46
87.

791
00:32:31.46 --> 00:32:32.30
87.

792
00:32:32.30 --> 00:32:33.50
Yep, June.

793
00:32:33.50 --> 00:32:35.74
So, you know, go the way until the winter time

794
00:32:35.74 --> 00:32:37.62
to make it a little bit more pleasant down there.

795
00:32:37.62 --> 00:32:40.26
But yeah, so we ended up there in June,

796
00:32:40.26 --> 00:32:44.10
graduated in August, you know, three months down there.

797
00:32:45.14 --> 00:32:48.82
And then went straight off to Camp Lejeune,

798
00:32:48.82 --> 00:32:52.14
went up to Camp Geiger's where the infantry school was

799
00:32:52.14 --> 00:32:53.98
at the time and went through, you know,

800
00:32:53.98 --> 00:32:57.38
Infantry Training School, 0311, you made it.

801
00:32:57.38 --> 00:32:58.22
How?

802
00:32:58.22 --> 00:33:00.98
How 311, you made it.

803
00:33:02.14 --> 00:33:04.86
How was that, how was that infantry school?

804
00:33:04.86 --> 00:33:09.86
Again, you know, kind of looking back on,

805
00:33:12.06 --> 00:33:17.06
I mean, it's so many like new Marines coming in

806
00:33:17.98 --> 00:33:20.54
that you don't really like get a lot of that

807
00:33:20.54 --> 00:33:23.38
individual education training.

808
00:33:23.38 --> 00:33:25.46
How long was the school?

809
00:33:25.46 --> 00:33:27.86
I think it was like 10 weeks, maybe.

810
00:33:27.86 --> 00:33:31.50
Did you have Vietnam guys teaching you or not really?

811
00:33:31.50 --> 00:33:35.98
Some of the older, like the E7s and E8s that were there

812
00:33:35.98 --> 00:33:38.26
were Vietnam era guys, but you know,

813
00:33:38.26 --> 00:33:42.18
like what you would call like the troop handlers

814
00:33:42.18 --> 00:33:44.94
or more like the corporals and the sergeants kind of.

815
00:33:44.94 --> 00:33:48.62
So those guys had come in in like the early 80s

816
00:33:48.62 --> 00:33:51.58
and were there, but the senior folks,

817
00:33:51.58 --> 00:33:54.62
yeah, they were Vietnam era guys.

818
00:33:54.62 --> 00:33:57.02
Did you think you were going to war at some point?

819
00:33:59.22 --> 00:34:00.90
Yeah, no.

820
00:34:00.90 --> 00:34:05.82
Yeah, I mean, never really even like crossed my mind,

821
00:34:05.82 --> 00:34:09.06
you know, at the point, you know, when,

822
00:34:09.06 --> 00:34:11.42
like I remember I listened to you when you had like,

823
00:34:11.42 --> 00:34:13.74
when you and Dave, when you had Dave Burke on,

824
00:34:13.74 --> 00:34:16.94
you were talking about like the top gun when like we grew up.

825
00:34:16.94 --> 00:34:21.86
I was more of the John Jay Rambo kind of like being John Jay

826
00:34:21.86 --> 00:34:24.46
kind of turned me on more than like Tom Cruise.

827
00:34:24.46 --> 00:34:25.30
Oh yeah, for sure.

828
00:34:25.30 --> 00:34:28.34
I mean, I couldn't relate to Tom Cruise.

829
00:34:28.34 --> 00:34:31.14
Yeah, I wanted like the green Odie green jacket

830
00:34:31.14 --> 00:34:34.46
where jeans boots get a big knife with like a compass

831
00:34:34.46 --> 00:34:36.06
on the top of it, you know what I mean?

832
00:34:36.06 --> 00:34:37.34
With matches in it.

833
00:34:38.34 --> 00:34:40.94
Yeah, I wanted to be John Jay.

834
00:34:40.94 --> 00:34:45.94
So, you know, those aspects of it were pretty interesting.

835
00:34:46.06 --> 00:34:49.34
Did you have like a global perspective of the world

836
00:34:49.34 --> 00:34:51.14
and think, well, you know, it's the, you know,

837
00:34:53.62 --> 00:34:56.26
Cold War is going on, you know, this could kick off.

838
00:34:56.26 --> 00:34:59.26
Did you, did you have any thoughts like that?

839
00:34:59.26 --> 00:35:00.10
Yeah, no.

840
00:35:00.10 --> 00:35:02.06
Yeah, I was gonna say, because I, you know,

841
00:35:02.06 --> 00:35:03.18
I joined in 1990.

842
00:35:03.18 --> 00:35:06.62
Now what changed for me was that the Gulf War was starting,

843
00:35:06.62 --> 00:35:07.46
right?

844
00:35:07.46 --> 00:35:10.38
So when I came in, it was like, oh, we're going on.

845
00:35:10.38 --> 00:35:13.18
I remember watching CNN and CNN is saying there's gonna be

846
00:35:13.18 --> 00:35:16.94
something like 30,000 casualties in the first 48 hours

847
00:35:16.94 --> 00:35:17.94
on our side.

848
00:35:17.94 --> 00:35:19.50
And I was like, oh, bro, we're going.

849
00:35:19.50 --> 00:35:21.38
Like I was thinking it's on.

850
00:35:21.38 --> 00:35:24.30
I'm gonna get some for sure.

851
00:35:24.30 --> 00:35:28.18
And then once that was over, it seemed like that I just

852
00:35:28.18 --> 00:35:30.50
seemed like, well, I'm gonna be doing some kind of secret

853
00:35:30.50 --> 00:35:32.70
shit's going on, you know, like the SEAL teams,

854
00:35:32.70 --> 00:35:35.14
come on, we're doing stuff worldwide all the time.

855
00:35:35.14 --> 00:35:37.18
There's secret missions going on.

856
00:35:37.18 --> 00:35:40.74
I'm obviously going to Vietnam and fighting whatever

857
00:35:40.74 --> 00:35:43.50
John Jay Rambo style for that stuff.

858
00:35:43.50 --> 00:35:46.74
But going to the Marine Corps 1987,

859
00:35:47.86 --> 00:35:50.74
the world was pretty, pretty peaceful at that time.

860
00:35:50.74 --> 00:35:55.50
Yeah, you know, in the Marines, we had one of the corporals

861
00:35:55.50 --> 00:35:58.10
that was there that was at the infantry school.

862
00:35:58.10 --> 00:36:00.26
He was a Beirut guy.

863
00:36:00.26 --> 00:36:03.06
So, you know, like back then, like Beirut was like,

864
00:36:03.06 --> 00:36:07.30
which was huge for the Marine Corps, you know, that incident.

865
00:36:07.30 --> 00:36:11.26
And so that was kind of, you know, Beirut and Granada

866
00:36:11.26 --> 00:36:13.66
were pretty much like the only two things.

867
00:36:13.66 --> 00:36:17.58
And if you weren't with like a specific one battalion,

868
00:36:17.58 --> 00:36:19.94
then everybody else in the Marine Corps, you know,

869
00:36:19.94 --> 00:36:22.54
they just had the overseas deployment ribbon

870
00:36:22.54 --> 00:36:23.98
with the good conduct.

871
00:36:23.98 --> 00:36:25.70
And that's it, you know what I mean?

872
00:36:25.70 --> 00:36:29.06
There wasn't any like solids hanging out

873
00:36:29.06 --> 00:36:32.58
except for the, you know, the Beirut guys.

874
00:36:32.58 --> 00:36:37.58
And then I would say that my first battalion I got sent to

875
00:36:37.58 --> 00:36:39.22
was second battalion, eighth Marines.

876
00:36:39.22 --> 00:36:40.54
And it was on Camp Geiger.

877
00:36:40.54 --> 00:36:43.02
And all that I did was was put my C-bag on my back

878
00:36:43.02 --> 00:36:44.14
and face to the right.

879
00:36:44.14 --> 00:36:47.54
And we just walked down to the eighth Marines barracks

880
00:36:47.54 --> 00:36:49.30
and it was open squad bay.

881
00:36:49.30 --> 00:36:51.14
That's where your first assignment was?

882
00:36:51.14 --> 00:36:51.98
Mm-hmm.

883
00:36:51.98 --> 00:36:52.98
That was second battalion, eighth Marines.

884
00:36:52.98 --> 00:36:54.02
That was on Camp Geiger.

885
00:36:54.02 --> 00:36:56.26
It was a eighth Marine regiment was on Geiger.

886
00:36:56.26 --> 00:36:59.06
Everybody else was on main side Camp Lejeune.

887
00:36:59.06 --> 00:37:01.46
And Geiger was open squad bay.

888
00:37:02.38 --> 00:37:04.82
So it was, and a lot of people talk about like being

889
00:37:04.82 --> 00:37:07.06
an open squad, I loved open squad.

890
00:37:07.06 --> 00:37:07.90
It was camp.

891
00:37:07.90 --> 00:37:08.74
Yeah.

892
00:37:08.74 --> 00:37:09.58
I mean, you know what I mean?

893
00:37:09.58 --> 00:37:10.42
What a camp.

894
00:37:10.42 --> 00:37:11.26
It was more camp.

895
00:37:11.26 --> 00:37:12.10
You know what I mean?

896
00:37:12.10 --> 00:37:13.18
I got up there, you know, you're in the platoon.

897
00:37:13.18 --> 00:37:16.30
You really get to know like the guys in the platoon

898
00:37:16.30 --> 00:37:17.90
because of the open squad bay.

899
00:37:17.90 --> 00:37:20.10
I mean, there's no hiding from anybody.

900
00:37:20.10 --> 00:37:21.14
It's not like at the end of the day,

901
00:37:21.14 --> 00:37:23.14
you go to your barracks room and you shut the door

902
00:37:23.14 --> 00:37:25.50
and it's just you and one other guy and the open squad bay.

903
00:37:25.50 --> 00:37:27.22
People can walk through it anytime.

904
00:37:27.22 --> 00:37:29.18
It's all your stuff's exposed.

905
00:37:29.18 --> 00:37:32.38
You get a foot locker and a wall locker and that's it.

906
00:37:32.38 --> 00:37:34.26
So you didn't really, you know, like nowadays,

907
00:37:34.26 --> 00:37:36.90
like kids move into their rooms and they got TVs,

908
00:37:36.90 --> 00:37:39.06
they got Xbox, they got all this kind of stuff.

909
00:37:39.06 --> 00:37:41.54
You couldn't have that stuff, you know,

910
00:37:41.54 --> 00:37:45.50
because you had one TV and the duty NCO controlled

911
00:37:45.50 --> 00:37:48.46
what channel it was on.

912
00:37:48.46 --> 00:37:52.34
But yeah, so it was pretty cool on those aspects.

913
00:37:52.34 --> 00:37:54.26
And then as soon as I got to Second Battalion,

914
00:37:54.26 --> 00:37:59.26
Eighth Marines, my first training op was cold weather training

915
00:38:00.02 --> 00:38:02.86
up the Bridgeport, California, which was banging.

916
00:38:02.86 --> 00:38:04.26
Yeah.

917
00:38:04.26 --> 00:38:05.10
You know what I mean?

918
00:38:05.10 --> 00:38:06.10
They got ski lifts up there.

919
00:38:06.10 --> 00:38:06.94
We're skiing.

920
00:38:06.94 --> 00:38:09.58
Of course that was the first time like you ski uphill,

921
00:38:09.58 --> 00:38:12.02
like with a pack, which that sucks.

922
00:38:12.02 --> 00:38:12.86
It's not as cool as you thought it was.

923
00:38:12.86 --> 00:38:14.54
Yeah, not as cool, you know what I mean?

924
00:38:14.54 --> 00:38:18.10
Like I wanted to go to like Tahoe and do some downhill.

925
00:38:18.10 --> 00:38:19.86
And then of course, you know, Marine Corps

926
00:38:19.86 --> 00:38:22.94
with our mountaineering skis are low as bitter.

927
00:38:22.94 --> 00:38:25.82
So it's like two by four strapped with a, you know what I mean?

928
00:38:25.82 --> 00:38:28.66
With a boot band wrapped around your Mickey Mouse boots.

929
00:38:28.66 --> 00:38:30.34
And you're going to head down the hill

930
00:38:30.34 --> 00:38:32.94
with a 90 pound Ruck-On and a rifle hanging off

931
00:38:32.94 --> 00:38:34.10
the front of you.

932
00:38:34.10 --> 00:38:37.06
That was the only point that I was really excited

933
00:38:37.06 --> 00:38:39.22
that I wasn't a machine gunner.

934
00:38:39.22 --> 00:38:40.06
You know what I mean?

935
00:38:40.06 --> 00:38:42.98
Like skiing with a machine gun.

936
00:38:42.98 --> 00:38:44.74
There's a whole other level.

937
00:38:44.74 --> 00:38:48.46
And how long were you at 28 for?

938
00:38:48.46 --> 00:38:53.46
I was at 28 for, I stayed from just at the end of 87,

939
00:38:54.42 --> 00:38:56.34
right into 89.

940
00:38:56.34 --> 00:38:57.94
Oh, so you did years there.

941
00:38:57.94 --> 00:38:59.06
This is your first assignment.

942
00:38:59.06 --> 00:38:59.90
Yeah.

943
00:38:59.90 --> 00:39:01.58
Yeah, this is my first battalion.

944
00:39:01.58 --> 00:39:02.42
What do you do?

945
00:39:02.42 --> 00:39:04.02
Did you go on deployment from there?

946
00:39:04.02 --> 00:39:04.86
Yep.

947
00:39:04.86 --> 00:39:06.34
So we did like the Bridgeport thing.

948
00:39:06.34 --> 00:39:07.62
You know, you do like your work up.

949
00:39:07.62 --> 00:39:09.06
But did you do, you do a work up?

950
00:39:09.06 --> 00:39:11.02
Did you go like get on a boat and go on deployment

951
00:39:11.02 --> 00:39:12.46
to the med or something like that?

952
00:39:12.46 --> 00:39:16.10
Well, we actually did Westpac because we came in,

953
00:39:16.10 --> 00:39:19.78
flew over to Oki and then my first boat ride

954
00:39:19.78 --> 00:39:22.18
was on the USS Fort McHenry.

955
00:39:22.18 --> 00:39:23.02
Right on.

956
00:39:23.02 --> 00:39:26.18
Which, you know, as a kid in camp,

957
00:39:26.18 --> 00:39:31.18
like I read, like, I enjoy reading and books on adventure.

958
00:39:33.66 --> 00:39:34.50
You know what I mean?

959
00:39:34.50 --> 00:39:35.34
And I always thought like,

960
00:39:35.34 --> 00:39:37.90
when I look at like a Navy ship,

961
00:39:37.90 --> 00:39:40.46
it's kind of like being in Huntington, West Virginia.

962
00:39:40.46 --> 00:39:44.70
It's a blue collar community, a float.

963
00:39:44.70 --> 00:39:46.74
So these are like all the guys, like in the Navy,

964
00:39:46.74 --> 00:39:49.14
like they got guys that like have jobs.

965
00:39:49.14 --> 00:39:50.30
Like they do stuff.

966
00:39:50.30 --> 00:39:51.26
Diesel mechanics.

967
00:39:51.26 --> 00:39:52.10
Yeah.

968
00:39:52.10 --> 00:39:52.94
You know what I mean?

969
00:39:52.94 --> 00:39:55.58
And like we're in the Pacific.

970
00:39:55.58 --> 00:39:56.42
You know what I mean?

971
00:39:56.42 --> 00:40:01.18
And it's just like, you get to see how small you actually are.

972
00:40:01.18 --> 00:40:02.86
But you know, being with the Navy,

973
00:40:02.86 --> 00:40:04.46
Marines don't have a job on the boat.

974
00:40:04.46 --> 00:40:05.30
You know what I mean?

975
00:40:05.30 --> 00:40:08.78
We get up, we are point of place of duty is in the rack.

976
00:40:08.78 --> 00:40:11.50
We stand in Chow line a lot.

977
00:40:11.50 --> 00:40:12.34
You know what I mean?

978
00:40:12.34 --> 00:40:13.30
It's like, get done with breakfast.

979
00:40:13.30 --> 00:40:14.14
What are you going to do?

980
00:40:14.14 --> 00:40:15.46
I'm going to go wait for lunch.

981
00:40:15.46 --> 00:40:16.74
Go wait for lunch.

982
00:40:16.74 --> 00:40:18.70
Stand in line and sit there with a book.

983
00:40:18.70 --> 00:40:20.02
And when the Navy gets pissed off

984
00:40:20.02 --> 00:40:22.22
that the Marines are laying around all over their stuff,

985
00:40:22.22 --> 00:40:25.02
they call general quarters and we go to the rack.

986
00:40:25.02 --> 00:40:26.98
And, you know, and they go to work.

987
00:40:26.98 --> 00:40:30.38
But yeah, I was always intrigued with the Navy.

988
00:40:30.38 --> 00:40:34.46
Like, you know, and then just the global of travel

989
00:40:34.46 --> 00:40:37.74
and like a Navy ship captain.

990
00:40:37.74 --> 00:40:42.38
Always seemed like a super cool job to have

991
00:40:42.38 --> 00:40:44.46
being a, you know, aboard a ship.

992
00:40:44.46 --> 00:40:46.14
And it's so blue collar.

993
00:40:46.14 --> 00:40:48.42
I mean, the guys in the Navy aboard the ships,

994
00:40:48.42 --> 00:40:50.82
you know, we floated Gator Navy.

995
00:40:50.82 --> 00:40:53.54
But they were like super great guys.

996
00:40:53.54 --> 00:40:56.34
They all had skill sets from, you know, electricians

997
00:40:56.34 --> 00:40:58.78
to the laundry, the cooks.

998
00:40:58.78 --> 00:41:00.94
I mean, it just, it was, it was like, you know,

999
00:41:00.94 --> 00:41:02.82
being in Pittsburgh, you know,

1000
00:41:02.82 --> 00:41:04.42
except everybody doesn't have a mullet.

1001
00:41:04.42 --> 00:41:05.26
You know what I mean?

1002
00:41:05.26 --> 00:41:06.74
They got a haircut.

1003
00:41:06.74 --> 00:41:10.06
And it's like you're a float with a blue collar town.

1004
00:41:10.06 --> 00:41:11.90
And it was a, it was super cool.

1005
00:41:11.90 --> 00:41:14.02
We went to Korea, you know what I mean?

1006
00:41:14.02 --> 00:41:15.86
So, and that was one of the things that intrigued me

1007
00:41:15.86 --> 00:41:18.02
about just joining the Marines was I was going to get

1008
00:41:18.02 --> 00:41:21.34
the travel and get paid.

1009
00:41:21.34 --> 00:41:22.42
Like, you know what I mean?

1010
00:41:22.42 --> 00:41:24.98
I get to go to cool places and, you know,

1011
00:41:24.98 --> 00:41:29.18
so, you know, going to Korea, going to Japan, Philippines,

1012
00:41:29.18 --> 00:41:30.78
you know, those kind of aspects.

1013
00:41:30.78 --> 00:41:32.18
And I'm getting a paycheck at the same time.

1014
00:41:32.18 --> 00:41:33.82
Are you guys doing exercises there?

1015
00:41:33.82 --> 00:41:34.66
We're just going to go ashore.

1016
00:41:34.66 --> 00:41:35.94
Yeah, you know, like Team Spirit.

1017
00:41:35.94 --> 00:41:38.22
You know, all those little names that they have for stuff

1018
00:41:38.22 --> 00:41:39.94
because, you know, we're fighting Ivan.

1019
00:41:39.94 --> 00:41:42.34
So everything's in Ivan.

1020
00:41:42.34 --> 00:41:45.58
And, you know, we just, we go out, we go to the field,

1021
00:41:45.58 --> 00:41:48.26
we run exercises, we come back, and then we get like,

1022
00:41:48.26 --> 00:41:51.02
you know, like four or five days off.

1023
00:41:51.02 --> 00:41:54.62
And in 88, the Olympics were in Seoul, Korea.

1024
00:41:54.62 --> 00:41:55.90
So that was-

1025
00:41:55.90 --> 00:41:57.02
So you were there for that?

1026
00:41:57.02 --> 00:41:57.86
Yeah, like-

1027
00:41:57.86 --> 00:41:59.50
Did you guys work security or anything or no?

1028
00:41:59.50 --> 00:42:01.30
No, no, yeah.

1029
00:42:01.30 --> 00:42:04.98
The Marines stay down in Po-hang,

1030
00:42:04.98 --> 00:42:07.90
right outside of Po-hang, and it was called Camp Moonchuck.

1031
00:42:07.90 --> 00:42:10.02
We called it Mudchuck.

1032
00:42:10.02 --> 00:42:12.58
You were still burning shitters there.

1033
00:42:12.58 --> 00:42:17.22
Yeah, I mean, it was primitive camp.

1034
00:42:17.22 --> 00:42:19.90
This is where you guys, when the ship pulled in,

1035
00:42:19.90 --> 00:42:20.98
that's where you went?

1036
00:42:20.98 --> 00:42:23.42
Yep, Navy would kick us off, you know what I mean?

1037
00:42:23.42 --> 00:42:25.82
And then we'd go into Camp Mudchuck,

1038
00:42:25.82 --> 00:42:27.14
and we'd go into there.

1039
00:42:27.14 --> 00:42:28.78
But, you know, and then they had ranges.

1040
00:42:28.78 --> 00:42:30.94
We would, you know, do company exercises,

1041
00:42:30.94 --> 00:42:32.70
battalion exercises, grenade range.

1042
00:42:32.70 --> 00:42:34.46
And you're a straight rifleman in a platoon.

1043
00:42:34.46 --> 00:42:35.90
You're a straight rifleman.

1044
00:42:35.90 --> 00:42:37.54
That's it, rifleman.

1045
00:42:37.54 --> 00:42:39.14
Did you like being a rifleman?

1046
00:42:39.14 --> 00:42:40.14
I loved it.

1047
00:42:40.14 --> 00:42:42.54
I mean, it's all, I mean, like being a rifleman,

1048
00:42:42.54 --> 00:42:43.98
you just get a rifle.

1049
00:42:43.98 --> 00:42:45.30
Yeah.

1050
00:42:45.30 --> 00:42:47.42
It was super, yeah, it was super cool.

1051
00:42:47.42 --> 00:42:49.38
The guys in a platoon, you know,

1052
00:42:49.38 --> 00:42:51.54
you got all these different characters,

1053
00:42:51.54 --> 00:42:55.90
just from all over, that just make things like so interesting.

1054
00:42:55.90 --> 00:42:58.22
Just, you know, of hearing the stories

1055
00:42:58.22 --> 00:43:00.50
and their background, where they grew up.

1056
00:43:01.34 --> 00:43:02.82
You know, and back then,

1057
00:43:02.82 --> 00:43:05.94
we didn't really intermix a lot with like the platoon commander.

1058
00:43:05.94 --> 00:43:06.78
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:43:06.78 --> 00:43:07.62
You know what I mean?

1060
00:43:07.62 --> 00:43:11.26
Like our biggest is usually like your squad leader,

1061
00:43:11.26 --> 00:43:13.14
because he controls your life.

1062
00:43:13.14 --> 00:43:16.78
And then the platoon sergeant is a big role.

1063
00:43:16.78 --> 00:43:18.14
And, you know, like the lieutenant,

1064
00:43:18.14 --> 00:43:20.94
you'd like see him at like formation or something.

1065
00:43:20.94 --> 00:43:21.78
You know what I mean?

1066
00:43:21.78 --> 00:43:24.86
Because like you didn't stay in the same,

1067
00:43:24.86 --> 00:43:27.38
you know, officers are segregated out, you know,

1068
00:43:27.38 --> 00:43:29.42
and then you just, what we, you know,

1069
00:43:29.42 --> 00:43:30.98
they're not in cell block.

1070
00:43:30.98 --> 00:43:31.82
You know what I mean?

1071
00:43:31.82 --> 00:43:32.82
Like we're hanging out.

1072
00:43:32.82 --> 00:43:34.70
This is back when the Marines had,

1073
00:43:34.70 --> 00:43:37.38
didn't you have name tags on their uniforms?

1074
00:43:37.38 --> 00:43:38.22
No.

1075
00:43:38.22 --> 00:43:39.22
It was just like, what's your name?

1076
00:43:39.22 --> 00:43:40.82
My name is Corporal.

1077
00:43:40.82 --> 00:43:42.50
Yeah, that's it.

1078
00:43:42.50 --> 00:43:44.26
You can call me Marine if you want.

1079
00:43:44.26 --> 00:43:45.10
Yeah.

1080
00:43:45.10 --> 00:43:46.02
I rode to point on ships,

1081
00:43:46.02 --> 00:43:47.70
because I did a few deployments,

1082
00:43:47.70 --> 00:43:49.70
or I did three deployments on ships with Marines

1083
00:43:49.70 --> 00:43:52.10
and one with the carrier strike group.

1084
00:43:52.10 --> 00:43:53.22
But yeah, the Marines were just,

1085
00:43:53.22 --> 00:43:55.02
the other, I have to tell the story.

1086
00:43:55.02 --> 00:43:57.34
We, you know, there's a pain to get off the ship

1087
00:43:57.34 --> 00:43:59.42
when you pulled in, when you hit the pier,

1088
00:43:59.42 --> 00:44:00.94
because as soon as they rang the Liberty Bell,

1089
00:44:00.94 --> 00:44:02.34
everyone was in line to get out.

1090
00:44:02.34 --> 00:44:04.26
And it would take like an hour or more

1091
00:44:04.26 --> 00:44:06.02
to get to get through that line.

1092
00:44:06.02 --> 00:44:10.30
So we used to, ship pulls in, gets pier aside.

1093
00:44:10.30 --> 00:44:11.82
As soon as they call for Liberty,

1094
00:44:11.82 --> 00:44:13.74
we'd go to the gym and get a good workout

1095
00:44:13.74 --> 00:44:15.26
because the ship's not moving.

1096
00:44:15.26 --> 00:44:16.50
And there's no one in there

1097
00:44:16.50 --> 00:44:17.94
because everyone's trying to go on Liberty.

1098
00:44:17.94 --> 00:44:19.06
So there's one time we do that, you know,

1099
00:44:19.06 --> 00:44:22.22
get down, go, go work out, get down, take a shower,

1100
00:44:22.22 --> 00:44:23.62
put on our Liberty clothes.

1101
00:44:23.62 --> 00:44:25.62
It's been like an hour and a half.

1102
00:44:25.62 --> 00:44:28.26
And we go up to the quarter deck to leave.

1103
00:44:28.26 --> 00:44:32.42
And they're carrying a Marine back who was so wasted.

1104
00:44:32.42 --> 00:44:34.22
He got wasted in an hour and a half.

1105
00:44:34.22 --> 00:44:36.50
He was unconscious drunk, bro.

1106
00:44:36.50 --> 00:44:39.70
That's how hard he was going in the paint.

1107
00:44:39.70 --> 00:44:42.46
So that's, you know, good times with Marine Corps.

1108
00:44:42.46 --> 00:44:45.22
That's usually every, every port call.

1109
00:44:45.22 --> 00:44:47.30
I mean, somebody's going to ruin it.

1110
00:44:48.14 --> 00:44:50.42
And, and the thing that I used to always tell the Marine,

1111
00:44:50.42 --> 00:44:53.26
I mean, it's almost like being in jail.

1112
00:44:53.26 --> 00:44:56.02
Like if you go to the first port call

1113
00:44:56.02 --> 00:44:59.06
and you, you're done training in the first hour and a half

1114
00:44:59.06 --> 00:45:00.78
and then you get restricted to the boat

1115
00:45:00.78 --> 00:45:02.94
for six months of restriction.

1116
00:45:02.94 --> 00:45:03.78
I mean, that's prison.

1117
00:45:03.78 --> 00:45:05.74
Yeah. That's a sentence.

1118
00:45:05.74 --> 00:45:07.70
You know, everybody else is like, you know,

1119
00:45:07.70 --> 00:45:10.42
hitting it and, you know, but it's, you know,

1120
00:45:10.42 --> 00:45:12.66
when you, when you, when you keep everybody, you know,

1121
00:45:12.66 --> 00:45:15.10
caged up down there and cell block

1122
00:45:15.10 --> 00:45:17.50
and you're crossing the pond.

1123
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:19.62
And then, you know, you hit this Liberty port

1124
00:45:19.62 --> 00:45:23.10
and you're like, I mean, you're, you're 18, 19 years old.

1125
00:45:23.10 --> 00:45:26.90
And you're, you're legal drinking age everywhere in the world,

1126
00:45:26.90 --> 00:45:28.98
but here, you know what I mean?

1127
00:45:28.98 --> 00:45:30.70
And, and of course, you know, and,

1128
00:45:30.70 --> 00:45:32.18
but you've been in like training.

1129
00:45:32.18 --> 00:45:34.62
So, you know, through boot camp and infantry schools.

1130
00:45:34.62 --> 00:45:36.70
So it's not like, and you can't have beer in a barracks

1131
00:45:36.70 --> 00:45:38.18
because I lived in an open squad base.

1132
00:45:38.18 --> 00:45:41.06
So it wasn't like we even had refrigerators.

1133
00:45:41.06 --> 00:45:42.78
Yeah. So any chance you got

1134
00:45:42.78 --> 00:45:44.94
for like two and a half, three years living

1135
00:45:44.94 --> 00:45:46.54
in an open Bay barracks.

1136
00:45:46.54 --> 00:45:49.70
Yeah. Oh yeah. It was, loved it.

1137
00:45:49.70 --> 00:45:52.42
I mean, we used to like take the wall lockers.

1138
00:45:52.42 --> 00:45:55.66
Those old gray wall lock and put them up against the walls.

1139
00:45:55.66 --> 00:45:58.46
And, you know, and we would play hardball baseball.

1140
00:45:58.46 --> 00:46:01.18
Like cause you couldn't break anything.

1141
00:46:01.18 --> 00:46:04.98
I mean, it was like, you know, just the antics that went on.

1142
00:46:04.98 --> 00:46:06.74
And, you know, the only bad, you know, like back then

1143
00:46:06.74 --> 00:46:09.66
you could still smoke in the government areas.

1144
00:46:09.66 --> 00:46:12.26
And even on ship, I mean, I can remember being on the boats

1145
00:46:12.26 --> 00:46:15.54
and just like you'd go into the, to the cell block area

1146
00:46:15.54 --> 00:46:16.86
where the Marines are down there.

1147
00:46:16.86 --> 00:46:20.62
And there's just like that haze of smoke across the top.

1148
00:46:20.62 --> 00:46:24.30
But, you know, a guy's just laying around with a like Coke can

1149
00:46:24.30 --> 00:46:25.46
flicking ashes in it.

1150
00:46:25.46 --> 00:46:29.58
You know, it was a, it was a different, different world.

1151
00:46:29.58 --> 00:46:31.50
Did you, did you know you were like,

1152
00:46:31.50 --> 00:46:33.70
do you found your place when you got in the Marine Corps?

1153
00:46:33.70 --> 00:46:35.46
Were you like, oh, this is, I'm good.

1154
00:46:35.46 --> 00:46:36.82
I've got my job forever.

1155
00:46:37.78 --> 00:46:39.34
Yeah. Yeah.

1156
00:46:39.34 --> 00:46:42.30
I mean, it was like, I'm going to just go to camp

1157
00:46:42.30 --> 00:46:43.70
for the rest of my life.

1158
00:46:43.70 --> 00:46:47.14
Yeah. And the funny thing was, is, you know, you, you know,

1159
00:46:47.14 --> 00:46:49.62
we, you talked about Al Gray.

1160
00:46:49.62 --> 00:46:51.74
So this is 87.

1161
00:46:51.74 --> 00:46:55.14
He became the commandant while I was in boot camp.

1162
00:46:55.14 --> 00:46:59.50
So, I mean, you talk about just that a different kind of guy

1163
00:47:00.22 --> 00:47:01.66
of, of Al Gray.

1164
00:47:01.66 --> 00:47:04.82
I mean, it's what a lot of us consider the second enlightenment

1165
00:47:04.82 --> 00:47:06.50
of the Marine Corps.

1166
00:47:06.50 --> 00:47:10.34
And this guy is all about education.

1167
00:47:10.34 --> 00:47:13.14
You know, he's all about, he wants a university.

1168
00:47:13.14 --> 00:47:16.18
You know, I mean, I give it probably the coolest story

1169
00:47:16.18 --> 00:47:17.14
of Al Gray.

1170
00:47:17.14 --> 00:47:20.02
I met him in 89.

1171
00:47:20.02 --> 00:47:23.50
First battalion six Marines were looking for folks to do

1172
00:47:23.50 --> 00:47:25.30
contingency operations in Panama.

1173
00:47:25.30 --> 00:47:27.54
Noriega was running the joint down there.

1174
00:47:27.54 --> 00:47:32.50
So I left two eight, joined one six to be able to go do

1175
00:47:32.50 --> 00:47:34.62
contingency operations in Panama.

1176
00:47:34.62 --> 00:47:35.46
You know what I mean?

1177
00:47:35.46 --> 00:47:37.46
I thought one Panama triple canopy jungle,

1178
00:47:37.46 --> 00:47:38.66
it's got to be cool.

1179
00:47:39.94 --> 00:47:44.14
You know, I mean, and it was just another experience

1180
00:47:44.14 --> 00:47:44.98
to be able to.

1181
00:47:44.98 --> 00:47:48.78
I went to one six and I was down there.

1182
00:47:49.78 --> 00:47:53.18
And we stayed at the Rodman Naval Air Force,

1183
00:47:53.18 --> 00:47:55.10
Naval base down there right on the canal.

1184
00:47:55.10 --> 00:47:57.54
They had a Howard Air Force base that's down there.

1185
00:47:57.54 --> 00:48:00.18
And then the Marines operated out of what was called

1186
00:48:00.18 --> 00:48:02.82
the Aerehan Tank Farm.

1187
00:48:02.82 --> 00:48:05.10
It kind of looked like if you flew over top of it,

1188
00:48:05.10 --> 00:48:08.10
it looked like a golf course cut in the middle of the jungle.

1189
00:48:08.10 --> 00:48:12.30
Well, it was all like the tanks for refueling,

1190
00:48:12.30 --> 00:48:14.18
coming through the canal.

1191
00:48:14.18 --> 00:48:17.94
And just seeing the Panama Canal was like the greatest

1192
00:48:17.94 --> 00:48:22.94
engineering like I had ever seen like before.

1193
00:48:22.98 --> 00:48:25.78
Cause it used to be the Panama path.

1194
00:48:25.78 --> 00:48:27.26
You know, they used to just walk across

1195
00:48:27.26 --> 00:48:28.66
cause it was the skinniest point.

1196
00:48:28.66 --> 00:48:31.86
And to watch the locks and the ships come through

1197
00:48:31.86 --> 00:48:34.46
the canal was just amazing.

1198
00:48:34.46 --> 00:48:36.18
So, you know, for a 19 year old kid,

1199
00:48:36.18 --> 00:48:39.22
like seeing the Panama Canal and, you know,

1200
00:48:39.22 --> 00:48:40.66
reading about it, it was just,

1201
00:48:40.66 --> 00:48:42.18
it was an amazing experience.

1202
00:48:42.18 --> 00:48:46.70
But we would go out and you were on like a six day rotation.

1203
00:48:46.70 --> 00:48:49.82
And, you know, you did two days in the fob,

1204
00:48:49.82 --> 00:48:51.82
which was just out in the middle of the jungle.

1205
00:48:51.82 --> 00:48:53.74
It was the Ford operating base.

1206
00:48:53.74 --> 00:48:55.74
And then you would do two days on patrol.

1207
00:48:55.74 --> 00:48:58.02
And then they'd bring you back for two days in the rear.

1208
00:48:58.02 --> 00:48:59.78
And you were just on this rotation.

1209
00:48:59.78 --> 00:49:02.22
And there was just a company of Marines down there.

1210
00:49:02.22 --> 00:49:04.30
I was in Navy, Navy SEALs were down there.

1211
00:49:04.30 --> 00:49:06.38
You know, they had Army folks down there.

1212
00:49:07.78 --> 00:49:09.94
But that was our assignment.

1213
00:49:09.94 --> 00:49:13.46
And I remember Al Gray, it was the commandant

1214
00:49:13.46 --> 00:49:15.26
and I was in the fob.

1215
00:49:15.26 --> 00:49:18.06
And I'm sitting in the fighting position.

1216
00:49:18.06 --> 00:49:19.38
We had fighting positions around there.

1217
00:49:19.38 --> 00:49:21.14
So I was, you know, man in the fighting positions,

1218
00:49:21.14 --> 00:49:23.82
me and one other guy in the heat taps going down,

1219
00:49:23.82 --> 00:49:24.66
it's getting dark.

1220
00:49:24.66 --> 00:49:27.30
And we kind of concede like this entourage

1221
00:49:27.30 --> 00:49:29.74
of people milling about the area.

1222
00:49:29.74 --> 00:49:33.18
And it just not, it's not making too much sense of like,

1223
00:49:33.18 --> 00:49:34.34
like who is this?

1224
00:49:34.34 --> 00:49:36.54
Well, next thing you know, this older guy,

1225
00:49:36.54 --> 00:49:37.66
I mean, it's a dark out.

1226
00:49:37.66 --> 00:49:39.90
I really don't know who it is.

1227
00:49:39.90 --> 00:49:43.82
Hops down in the fighting position with me.

1228
00:49:43.82 --> 00:49:44.82
And he's like, hey, who are you?

1229
00:49:44.82 --> 00:49:47.74
I was like, oh, J.D. Baker.

1230
00:49:47.74 --> 00:49:48.58
You know what I mean?

1231
00:49:48.58 --> 00:49:50.10
And he's like, oh, how's things going?

1232
00:49:50.10 --> 00:49:52.14
I was like, who are you?

1233
00:49:52.14 --> 00:49:54.38
I was like, Al Gray.

1234
00:49:54.38 --> 00:49:57.22
And hmm, name sounds familiar.

1235
00:49:57.22 --> 00:49:58.98
You know what I mean?

1236
00:49:58.98 --> 00:50:01.38
Cause like, you know, Al Gray was just, you know,

1237
00:50:01.38 --> 00:50:02.66
Al Gray Marine.

1238
00:50:02.66 --> 00:50:05.34
I mean, that's just how he went by.

1239
00:50:05.34 --> 00:50:09.26
And he was a prior enlisted, you know, infantry,

1240
00:50:09.26 --> 00:50:10.54
made it all the way to Sergeant.

1241
00:50:10.54 --> 00:50:11.94
And they thought he'd make a good officer.

1242
00:50:11.94 --> 00:50:14.58
So they sent him to OCS and made his way up

1243
00:50:14.58 --> 00:50:17.18
through the ranks from New Jersey.

1244
00:50:17.18 --> 00:50:18.98
He was a baseball player.

1245
00:50:18.98 --> 00:50:21.42
So he started asking me just, I mean,

1246
00:50:21.42 --> 00:50:23.18
of anything going on, just asked me like,

1247
00:50:23.18 --> 00:50:24.98
who are my parents?

1248
00:50:24.98 --> 00:50:26.78
Like what's my dad do?

1249
00:50:26.78 --> 00:50:27.62
What's my mom do?

1250
00:50:27.62 --> 00:50:29.06
Kind of like the stuff how you and I,

1251
00:50:29.06 --> 00:50:30.90
when we first got on, just started asking me

1252
00:50:30.90 --> 00:50:32.70
those personal questions.

1253
00:50:32.70 --> 00:50:34.70
And when I told him about my dad with baseball,

1254
00:50:34.70 --> 00:50:37.98
he was like, you know, he like lit up like,

1255
00:50:37.98 --> 00:50:38.90
cause he was like, you know,

1256
00:50:38.90 --> 00:50:41.82
I played semi pro baseball up in New Jersey.

1257
00:50:41.82 --> 00:50:44.98
They call, he was called the Pelican Pounder.

1258
00:50:44.98 --> 00:50:46.06
He was a hell of an,

1259
00:50:46.06 --> 00:50:46.90
Pelican Pounder.

1260
00:50:46.90 --> 00:50:48.18
Yeah. He played for the Pelicans.

1261
00:50:48.18 --> 00:50:50.30
It was semi pro team up there.

1262
00:50:50.30 --> 00:50:52.26
And he literally, years later,

1263
00:50:52.26 --> 00:50:53.86
I was up at his house in Alexandria

1264
00:50:53.86 --> 00:50:56.14
and he's showing me the front page picture.

1265
00:50:56.14 --> 00:50:58.62
He had the clipping, you know, the Pelican Pounder,

1266
00:50:58.62 --> 00:51:01.38
Al Gray, which was pretty cool to see.

1267
00:51:01.38 --> 00:51:03.70
So he was a big baseball guy.

1268
00:51:03.70 --> 00:51:06.98
And for me being an E3, I was the last corporal

1269
00:51:06.98 --> 00:51:09.26
at that time with the comment on the Marine Corps.

1270
00:51:09.26 --> 00:51:14.26
I have now had a relationship with that guy for 35 years,

1271
00:51:15.42 --> 00:51:16.26
which was just amazing.

1272
00:51:16.26 --> 00:51:18.50
He was just a different.

1273
00:51:18.50 --> 00:51:21.02
How did you stay in touch with him after that?

1274
00:51:21.02 --> 00:51:22.90
He just reconnect with him later.

1275
00:51:22.90 --> 00:51:25.50
He's always been around the Marine Corps.

1276
00:51:25.50 --> 00:51:27.38
Like, you know, Al Gray has just,

1277
00:51:27.38 --> 00:51:28.22
Oh, for sure.

1278
00:51:28.22 --> 00:51:30.14
Yeah. I mean, he's just one of those guys like,

1279
00:51:30.14 --> 00:51:32.30
we could be sitting in here doing this podcast.

1280
00:51:32.30 --> 00:51:33.90
And next thing you know, he'd just show up.

1281
00:51:33.90 --> 00:51:35.34
I mean, because that's how he was.

1282
00:51:35.34 --> 00:51:36.90
It's like a comedot.

1283
00:51:36.90 --> 00:51:39.74
He didn't tell people when he was going places.

1284
00:51:39.74 --> 00:51:42.26
I mean, he just, his career was the first one

1285
00:51:42.26 --> 00:51:44.90
to just take his official photo and camis.

1286
00:51:45.90 --> 00:51:49.10
You know, the kind of guy that he was,

1287
00:51:50.14 --> 00:51:53.34
that really had a big effect on me

1288
00:51:53.34 --> 00:51:56.26
was when he was the Comedon of the Marine Corps

1289
00:51:56.26 --> 00:51:59.82
on the weekend, he was out front of his Comedon's house

1290
00:51:59.82 --> 00:52:02.34
at eighth and I, you know, down in Southeast DC.

1291
00:52:02.34 --> 00:52:05.50
And he's out doing the gardening

1292
00:52:05.50 --> 00:52:06.98
at the front of the house.

1293
00:52:06.98 --> 00:52:11.42
And this elderly black woman that lived down the street

1294
00:52:11.42 --> 00:52:15.14
was walking by and she was, you know, stopped and said,

1295
00:52:15.14 --> 00:52:17.70
hello. And, you know, Al Gray was like, hey, how you doing?

1296
00:52:17.70 --> 00:52:19.66
Didn't say like who he was.

1297
00:52:19.66 --> 00:52:21.94
She just thought he was the gardener.

1298
00:52:21.94 --> 00:52:24.26
And she's like, man, I've lived here in South DCC

1299
00:52:24.26 --> 00:52:25.62
my entire life.

1300
00:52:25.62 --> 00:52:28.02
And I've always wondered what it looks like

1301
00:52:28.02 --> 00:52:30.26
on the inside of that house.

1302
00:52:30.26 --> 00:52:33.38
So Al Gray was kind of like, interesting.

1303
00:52:33.38 --> 00:52:35.26
So goes to a staff meeting on Monday

1304
00:52:35.26 --> 00:52:37.62
and he's like, I'm having a garden party

1305
00:52:37.62 --> 00:52:40.10
and I'm inviting all my neighbors.

1306
00:52:41.22 --> 00:52:45.94
So they send out invitations to block radiuses all around.

1307
00:52:45.94 --> 00:52:47.70
You know, eighth and I, and he's inviting,

1308
00:52:47.70 --> 00:52:49.18
of course, you know, he's got staff guys going,

1309
00:52:49.18 --> 00:52:50.42
okay, we're going to put a rope here.

1310
00:52:50.42 --> 00:52:51.46
Let's take this thing down.

1311
00:52:51.46 --> 00:52:52.98
I mean, cause they got a lot of like a

1312
00:52:52.98 --> 00:52:54.86
Chesty pullers underwear in there or something.

1313
00:52:54.86 --> 00:52:56.98
I don't want somebody to take, you know what I mean?

1314
00:52:56.98 --> 00:52:59.50
Al Gray's like, no, man, these are my neighbors.

1315
00:52:59.50 --> 00:53:02.10
Like, do you, like when your neighbors come over,

1316
00:53:02.10 --> 00:53:03.46
do you put stuff away?

1317
00:53:03.46 --> 00:53:05.74
Do you put ropes up and they're only allowed

1318
00:53:05.74 --> 00:53:07.06
in certain sections of your house?

1319
00:53:07.06 --> 00:53:08.82
These are my neighbors.

1320
00:53:08.82 --> 00:53:11.02
And sure enough, man, he has his party

1321
00:53:11.02 --> 00:53:12.46
and the neighbors are all coming in.

1322
00:53:12.46 --> 00:53:14.70
And here's that elderly black woman comes in

1323
00:53:14.70 --> 00:53:16.82
and who she meet at the door.

1324
00:53:16.82 --> 00:53:19.26
Al Gray, she thought he was the gardener.

1325
00:53:19.26 --> 00:53:20.10
And there he is.

1326
00:53:20.10 --> 00:53:22.14
I mean, when they got done with the end of the event,

1327
00:53:22.14 --> 00:53:24.90
not one thing was stolen, nothing broken.

1328
00:53:24.90 --> 00:53:27.30
You know what I mean? And the Marines up at eighth and I

1329
00:53:27.30 --> 00:53:29.50
weren't having any more problems out in town anymore

1330
00:53:29.50 --> 00:53:31.58
with the neighbors in and around Southeast DC.

1331
00:53:31.58 --> 00:53:35.26
It was just an extended hand of these are our neighbors.

1332
00:53:35.26 --> 00:53:39.88
And that's kind of sums up of like who Al Gray is.

1333
00:53:39.88 --> 00:53:43.62
So he had a huge effect on the Marine Corps

1334
00:53:43.62 --> 00:53:46.18
just in that four year period of time.

1335
00:53:46.18 --> 00:53:51.18
And I just got lucky enough to meet him in Panama in 89

1336
00:53:51.18 --> 00:53:55.46
and just stayed in contact of it.

1337
00:53:55.46 --> 00:53:58.66
And his memory is just like he could remember

1338
00:53:58.66 --> 00:54:03.10
like exact dates, names of it.

1339
00:54:03.10 --> 00:54:05.62
The guy's got a phenomenal memory

1340
00:54:05.62 --> 00:54:07.22
and he was self-educated.

1341
00:54:08.10 --> 00:54:08.94
You know what I mean?

1342
00:54:08.94 --> 00:54:11.34
He was number one thing was the library.

1343
00:54:11.34 --> 00:54:12.18
You know what I mean?

1344
00:54:12.18 --> 00:54:13.90
Get a book, read it.

1345
00:54:13.90 --> 00:54:16.94
And now Marine Corps has the reading list,

1346
00:54:16.94 --> 00:54:17.78
which is kind of cool.

1347
00:54:17.78 --> 00:54:19.42
We got a lot of cool books on there.

1348
00:54:19.42 --> 00:54:20.26
You know what I mean?

1349
00:54:20.26 --> 00:54:22.26
You go through the different grade levels

1350
00:54:22.26 --> 00:54:23.66
and you can get books.

1351
00:54:23.66 --> 00:54:26.02
And the Marine Corps was always really big

1352
00:54:26.02 --> 00:54:28.62
into their history and big into the reading,

1353
00:54:28.62 --> 00:54:32.38
which one that fell in line with me, love history,

1354
00:54:32.38 --> 00:54:34.54
love the reading aspect of it.

1355
00:54:34.54 --> 00:54:36.90
And reading, if this is gonna be your trade,

1356
00:54:36.90 --> 00:54:38.14
if this is what you're gonna do,

1357
00:54:38.14 --> 00:54:41.14
then you need to read a lot of books.

1358
00:54:41.14 --> 00:54:45.70
And I had some other officers, one Eric Carlson,

1359
00:54:45.70 --> 00:54:48.16
he told me to cast my net widely.

1360
00:54:48.16 --> 00:54:51.20
Like don't just pigeonhole,

1361
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:54.40
like just don't read all military.

1362
00:54:54.40 --> 00:54:55.24
You know what I mean?

1363
00:54:55.24 --> 00:55:00.24
So cast your net widely so you get a different perspective

1364
00:55:00.44 --> 00:55:01.52
on different things.

1365
00:55:01.52 --> 00:55:06.52
And so that was pretty cool with Eric and casting my net.

1366
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.88
So I mean, I read from Danielle Steele,

1367
00:55:12.88 --> 00:55:15.32
anything that I could get my hands on

1368
00:55:15.32 --> 00:55:17.72
just to be able to read.

1369
00:55:17.72 --> 00:55:21.28
And the imagination, Rudyard Kipling,

1370
00:55:21.28 --> 00:55:23.40
Henry David Thoreau.

1371
00:55:23.40 --> 00:55:26.40
I even read some theoretical physicists,

1372
00:55:26.40 --> 00:55:29.80
the cork and the jaguar, which was like,

1373
00:55:29.80 --> 00:55:32.96
that'd be a cool job to be like a theoretical fit,

1374
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:34.40
just like sitting in a room like this.

1375
00:55:34.40 --> 00:55:39.40
And I just thank for eight hours of stuff and go back.

1376
00:55:39.60 --> 00:55:42.46
But that was pretty cool.

1377
00:55:42.46 --> 00:55:45.20
Where were you when the invasion went down in Panama?

1378
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:49.12
We were, the invasion, we were back,

1379
00:55:49.12 --> 00:55:51.44
stay side because we were rotated in.

1380
00:55:51.44 --> 00:55:54.36
You went down on a 90 day tour.

1381
00:55:54.36 --> 00:55:58.44
You did a 90 day and then rotated back.

1382
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:00.84
So that was in 89.

1383
00:56:00.84 --> 00:56:04.72
But that was also, I was a fire team leader.

1384
00:56:04.72 --> 00:56:08.74
So that was like my first go around being a fire team leader.

1385
00:56:08.74 --> 00:56:11.34
And that was probably my first realization,

1386
00:56:11.34 --> 00:56:14.28
even though like nothing happened.

1387
00:56:14.28 --> 00:56:16.72
Like we didn't get any gunfights while we were down there.

1388
00:56:16.72 --> 00:56:19.32
There was events that were taking place, just me personally.

1389
00:56:19.32 --> 00:56:22.20
I didn't have any events.

1390
00:56:22.20 --> 00:56:25.12
But when you get issued live ammo

1391
00:56:25.12 --> 00:56:28.12
and you take the BFA off, you know what I mean?

1392
00:56:28.12 --> 00:56:29.50
It got real.

1393
00:56:30.32 --> 00:56:31.92
Like then I was kind of like, okay,

1394
00:56:31.92 --> 00:56:34.72
this isn't like camp anymore.

1395
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:36.20
You know what I mean?

1396
00:56:36.20 --> 00:56:38.80
But being in triple canopy down there,

1397
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:41.18
and we went, they used to have Fort Sherman,

1398
00:56:41.18 --> 00:56:42.76
the army base that was down there.

1399
00:56:42.76 --> 00:56:45.20
And you'd go through jungle warfare

1400
00:56:45.20 --> 00:56:47.92
and jungle survival, a phenomenal place.

1401
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:48.76
You know, when they take you down there,

1402
00:56:48.76 --> 00:56:50.64
they got like this little zoo

1403
00:56:50.64 --> 00:56:52.64
that they like show you the animals

1404
00:56:52.64 --> 00:56:55.64
that you can encounter while you're there.

1405
00:56:55.64 --> 00:56:57.56
It wasn't the Panamanian Defense Force

1406
00:56:57.56 --> 00:56:58.80
that we were scared of.

1407
00:56:58.80 --> 00:57:02.56
It was the creatures in that jungle.

1408
00:57:02.56 --> 00:57:05.24
We're like seeing like the Anaconda.

1409
00:57:05.24 --> 00:57:06.08
You know what I mean?

1410
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:08.36
I was like, that's a big snake.

1411
00:57:08.36 --> 00:57:10.88
I was lucky when I was at SEAL Team One,

1412
00:57:10.88 --> 00:57:15.88
we were like the designated Southeast Asia team.

1413
00:57:15.92 --> 00:57:17.76
And so we were supposed to be ready for the jungle.

1414
00:57:17.76 --> 00:57:20.44
And in our platoon workup, getting ready to deploy,

1415
00:57:20.44 --> 00:57:22.16
we went and did like a month in Panama.

1416
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:24.76
We went to that zoo, all that stuff went through that,

1417
00:57:24.76 --> 00:57:27.96
our army jungle survival training.

1418
00:57:29.12 --> 00:57:30.36
I don't know if we went through like a full school,

1419
00:57:30.36 --> 00:57:31.92
but it was like a couple, like a day and a half

1420
00:57:31.92 --> 00:57:32.76
or something like this.

1421
00:57:32.76 --> 00:57:34.88
They're showing you what to watch out for

1422
00:57:34.88 --> 00:57:37.40
and all that kind of stuff, but it was awesome.

1423
00:57:37.40 --> 00:57:38.80
You know, then we just went out

1424
00:57:38.80 --> 00:57:40.92
and lived in the jungle for like a month.

1425
00:57:40.92 --> 00:57:42.36
And we had a little base camp set up

1426
00:57:42.36 --> 00:57:44.96
and we go out and do our training throughout the day.

1427
00:57:44.96 --> 00:57:47.72
We would do occasion, we'd try and do night

1428
00:57:47.72 --> 00:57:50.16
immediate action drills, which is like completely black.

1429
00:57:50.16 --> 00:57:51.56
There's no night vision days, you know,

1430
00:57:51.56 --> 00:57:54.68
just completely black running through the jungle,

1431
00:57:54.68 --> 00:57:57.60
sending up a loom, you know, hitting trees

1432
00:57:57.60 --> 00:57:58.88
with your loom by accident.

1433
00:57:58.88 --> 00:58:01.64
Cause I was a radio missile, I was always firing a loom.

1434
00:58:01.64 --> 00:58:03.60
It was freaking awesome.

1435
00:58:03.60 --> 00:58:06.64
You get good when you spend that much time

1436
00:58:06.64 --> 00:58:08.12
in the field, you get good at it.

1437
00:58:08.12 --> 00:58:10.80
Yeah. And doing the three months down there,

1438
00:58:10.80 --> 00:58:13.68
that's where I would say that I got good

1439
00:58:13.68 --> 00:58:15.24
at being an infantryman.

1440
00:58:16.24 --> 00:58:18.44
But it was, yeah, that's amazing.

1441
00:58:18.44 --> 00:58:20.000
You're talking about like, you know, the,

1442
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.64
cause when it got dark,

1443
00:58:21.64 --> 00:58:22.48
oh, it's, I mean,

1444
00:58:22.48 --> 00:58:24.52
it's remember that the is black.

1445
00:58:24.52 --> 00:58:27.16
Well, dude, you remember those MVGs we had back then

1446
00:58:27.16 --> 00:58:29.76
to where it like the starlight scope to where, okay, well,

1447
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:31.76
one, it requires starlight.

1448
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:33.60
We didn't even use those down there.

1449
00:58:33.60 --> 00:58:35.64
And then you'd be in the radio operators.

1450
00:58:35.64 --> 00:58:36.48
I don't know what you got.

1451
00:58:36.48 --> 00:58:40.88
But remember we had the 77s, the prick 77s, the 104s,

1452
00:58:40.88 --> 00:58:43.68
you know what I mean to where like you had to be good.

1453
00:58:43.68 --> 00:58:45.24
Oh yeah. You had to have skills.

1454
00:58:45.24 --> 00:58:47.52
Yeah. I mean, it's a skill set to run.

1455
00:58:47.52 --> 00:58:49.36
Like when I look at the communications

1456
00:58:49.36 --> 00:58:52.16
that these folks have nowadays, it's like, wow,

1457
00:58:52.16 --> 00:58:57.16
like trying to get a comm shot with a 77 or a 104 was,

1458
00:58:57.88 --> 00:59:02.20
that's when the communicators had some serious skill sets

1459
00:59:02.20 --> 00:59:04.64
to be able to manipulate and operate comm,

1460
00:59:04.64 --> 00:59:06.44
especially down there.

1461
00:59:06.44 --> 00:59:08.40
That was the first time is like being a team leader.

1462
00:59:08.40 --> 00:59:12.000
I had to do like, you know, patrol overlays.

1463
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.76
So I had to, I had to get good at my job.

1464
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:19.16
And, and that I would say that that probably was the,

1465
00:59:19.16 --> 00:59:22.96
the pinnacle of like those three months, but down there,

1466
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:25.44
that's when I became an infantryman.

1467
00:59:25.44 --> 00:59:27.04
You know, as, as what we would call it,

1468
00:59:27.04 --> 00:59:31.52
because in 0311 is you're a scout is basically,

1469
00:59:31.52 --> 00:59:33.36
is pretty much what you are.

1470
00:59:33.36 --> 00:59:38.36
And then that had a big effect on me as being a Marine

1471
00:59:39.48 --> 00:59:42.64
of what's important as far as like training

1472
00:59:42.64 --> 00:59:45.20
and education wise of becoming a professional

1473
00:59:45.20 --> 00:59:47.64
infantryman was really big.

1474
00:59:47.64 --> 00:59:49.40
So it's not too long after that,

1475
00:59:49.40 --> 00:59:53.24
that the goal four starts heating up the first goal four.

1476
00:59:53.24 --> 00:59:54.08
Yes.

1477
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:55.84
And so where, how do you, how do you slot into that?

1478
00:59:55.84 --> 00:59:57.08
You're at one six now.

1479
00:59:57.08 --> 00:59:58.68
Yeah. I'm same battalion.

1480
00:59:58.68 --> 01:00:01.48
I was in Panama with, we got a new platoon start

1481
01:00:01.48 --> 01:00:05.68
when we came back, that guy, his name was Eli Tucker.

1482
01:00:05.68 --> 01:00:09.48
His nickname was Eli Tucker, the big motherfucker.

1483
01:00:09.48 --> 01:00:12.24
Cause that dude was jacked, you know what I mean?

1484
01:00:12.24 --> 01:00:14.96
And just ruthless, but a hell of an,

1485
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:17.16
he had a huge impact on me.

1486
01:00:17.16 --> 01:00:21.20
He was a Sergeant E five, but that guy, when, when,

1487
01:00:21.20 --> 01:00:23.56
when you, like, if you look up Marine infantrymen

1488
01:00:23.56 --> 01:00:27.04
in the dictionary, it's Eli Tucker is in that book.

1489
01:00:27.04 --> 01:00:30.96
He's just a phenomenal guy, both up and down the ladder.

1490
01:00:30.96 --> 01:00:35.24
He pulled respect from the officers as well as,

1491
01:00:35.24 --> 01:00:37.08
as any enlisted in that battalion.

1492
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:40.08
And, and so he was my platoon Sergeant.

1493
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.64
We were on, on deployment again over in the Far East.

1494
01:00:43.64 --> 01:00:48.24
And we hopped in, we were in the Philippines and Noriega

1495
01:00:48.24 --> 01:00:51.72
decided to add on to his, you know, Southern property.

1496
01:00:51.72 --> 01:00:52.56
So he,

1497
01:00:52.56 --> 01:00:53.40
Oh, you mean Saddam?

1498
01:00:53.40 --> 01:00:54.68
Yeah, Saddam. I mean, yeah.

1499
01:00:54.68 --> 01:00:58.36
So he takes over, he goes over, snatches up Kuwait.

1500
01:00:58.36 --> 01:00:59.48
We're in the Philippines.

1501
01:00:59.48 --> 01:01:01.28
They throw us on the USS broken.

1502
01:01:01.28 --> 01:01:05.64
I was the Oganawa and we steam around and they kick us

1503
01:01:05.64 --> 01:01:08.92
off the boat and we're in country right there coming

1504
01:01:08.92 --> 01:01:09.76
in September.

1505
01:01:09.76 --> 01:01:11.32
So it went down in August.

1506
01:01:11.32 --> 01:01:12.96
They had us in.

1507
01:01:12.96 --> 01:01:15.28
We were one of the first Marine battalions.

1508
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:18.000
They hit the ground in Saudi Arabia.

1509
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.28
And then it was just,

1510
01:01:20.36 --> 01:01:22.28
So did you stay there the whole time?

1511
01:01:22.28 --> 01:01:23.12
Yes.

1512
01:01:23.12 --> 01:01:24.96
How long were, how long were you there for?

1513
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:26.60
Like seven and a half months.

1514
01:01:26.60 --> 01:01:30.44
We, yeah, it was terrible. It was,

1515
01:01:30.44 --> 01:01:32.08
Do you live in an tent in the desert?

1516
01:01:32.08 --> 01:01:32.92
Basically,

1517
01:01:32.92 --> 01:01:33.76
We didn't even have to test.

1518
01:01:33.76 --> 01:01:36.12
Yeah. We had those radar scattering nets kind of things.

1519
01:01:36.12 --> 01:01:38.72
So you just, you know, in a poncho.

1520
01:01:38.72 --> 01:01:40.52
Yeah, we were just for,

1521
01:01:40.52 --> 01:01:42.20
For how long did you live like that?

1522
01:01:42.20 --> 01:01:44.60
We were out there for like over seven months.

1523
01:01:46.28 --> 01:01:47.60
Yeah, it was terrible.

1524
01:01:47.60 --> 01:01:49.08
And you had to have a cot, you know,

1525
01:01:49.08 --> 01:01:50.76
those little green cots because the,

1526
01:01:50.76 --> 01:01:53.68
the desert sand was just so hot.

1527
01:01:53.68 --> 01:01:55.84
But the cool thing was about the battalion, you know,

1528
01:01:55.84 --> 01:01:57.16
we kind of talked about earlier.

1529
01:01:57.16 --> 01:02:01.92
My battalion commander was Lieutenant Colonel Jones.

1530
01:02:01.92 --> 01:02:04.20
His, his initials were TC's.

1531
01:02:04.20 --> 01:02:06.44
We called him too cool.

1532
01:02:06.44 --> 01:02:11.44
And Jones was a phenomenal battalion commander.

1533
01:02:12.04 --> 01:02:15.64
Jones with, with, he was the kind of guy

1534
01:02:15.64 --> 01:02:18.48
that he'd like knew everybody in the battalion.

1535
01:02:18.48 --> 01:02:19.88
He knew where you were from.

1536
01:02:19.88 --> 01:02:23.16
He knew a little bit about, he was very personable.

1537
01:02:23.16 --> 01:02:27.28
So, you know, and that was almost like every Marine battalions,

1538
01:02:27.28 --> 01:02:30.28
their leadership were all Vietnam vets.

1539
01:02:31.32 --> 01:02:36.000
So they knew what was important of what we needed to know.

1540
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.16
There wasn't, you know,

1541
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:40.12
and then you go up to the regimental level

1542
01:02:40.12 --> 01:02:43.08
and then you've got Al Gray as the commandant.

1543
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:46.76
You know, you got Storm and Norman Swarshkoff,

1544
01:02:46.76 --> 01:02:47.72
you know what I mean?

1545
01:02:47.72 --> 01:02:49.88
Army commander and then joint chiefs.

1546
01:02:49.88 --> 01:02:51.60
You got Colm Powell kind of run.

1547
01:02:51.60 --> 01:02:55.20
So it's almost like the stars have aligned.

1548
01:02:55.20 --> 01:02:57.76
You know, when some folks are like, yeah, Desert Storm was like,

1549
01:02:57.76 --> 01:02:59.32
what, like 96 hours.

1550
01:02:59.32 --> 01:03:00.68
There's a reason for that.

1551
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:03.28
Because of those guys are like, yeah,

1552
01:03:03.28 --> 01:03:05.40
we're not doing this one again.

1553
01:03:05.40 --> 01:03:09.000
And I mean, when, when we were, it was a long wait.

1554
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.84
That was a.

1555
01:03:09.84 --> 01:03:10.80
And what are you doing while you're waiting?

1556
01:03:10.80 --> 01:03:13.000
Just training every day, prepping, getting ready.

1557
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.84
Trying, yep.

1558
01:03:13.84 --> 01:03:15.16
Trying on your gas mask.

1559
01:03:15.16 --> 01:03:16.64
Trying on your gas mask again.

1560
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:18.48
Trying on your gas mask again.

1561
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:20.44
Did you get, were you guys hearing this casualty thing

1562
01:03:20.44 --> 01:03:21.52
that I saw on CNN?

1563
01:03:21.52 --> 01:03:23.000
Like, hey, there's going to be mass casualties.

1564
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:23.84
Were you expecting that?

1565
01:03:23.84 --> 01:03:25.000
Were they briefing you on that?

1566
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.32
Yeah, they actually flew in a whole bunch of replacements

1567
01:03:29.32 --> 01:03:31.48
right prior to the ground war kicking off.

1568
01:03:31.48 --> 01:03:33.48
And we're like, what are these dudes doing here?

1569
01:03:33.48 --> 01:03:34.32
You know what I mean?

1570
01:03:34.32 --> 01:03:36.24
And they're like, oh, these are the replacement guys.

1571
01:03:36.24 --> 01:03:37.08
You know what I mean?

1572
01:03:37.08 --> 01:03:37.92
Of coming in.

1573
01:03:37.92 --> 01:03:40.40
So, you know, I would probably say like,

1574
01:03:40.40 --> 01:03:43.12
I got, I got really sick of the gas mask.

1575
01:03:43.12 --> 01:03:46.04
But when they show you like photos and stuff of like

1576
01:03:46.04 --> 01:03:50.04
what people look like with blister agent and like,

1577
01:03:50.04 --> 01:03:52.12
that was like a, that was a real threat.

1578
01:03:52.12 --> 01:03:55.72
Like everybody was like scared for those aspects

1579
01:03:55.72 --> 01:03:57.56
of the chemical mines and arbitrage.

1580
01:03:57.56 --> 01:04:01.88
And we had the mine belts of blowing the mine belts

1581
01:04:01.88 --> 01:04:06.28
that were out there, which was interesting within itself.

1582
01:04:06.28 --> 01:04:07.12
You know, when-

1583
01:04:07.12 --> 01:04:08.60
So that was your mission?

1584
01:04:08.60 --> 01:04:09.44
Yeah.

1585
01:04:09.44 --> 01:04:11.72
Well, we had to get through those mine belts first.

1586
01:04:11.72 --> 01:04:13.48
So there was two big mine belts.

1587
01:04:13.48 --> 01:04:16.12
So we got the, we're all, everybody's mecked up.

1588
01:04:16.12 --> 01:04:21.12
And you got the lines that can shoot over the back

1589
01:04:21.60 --> 01:04:24.40
of the Amtrak's and detonate.

1590
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:26.84
And then it give you a kind of a lane kind of a thing

1591
01:04:26.84 --> 01:04:28.16
to go through.

1592
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:29.76
Some of them worked, some of them didn't.

1593
01:04:29.76 --> 01:04:33.44
So we had that, yeah, we had tanks that were there with us.

1594
01:04:33.44 --> 01:04:34.72
The tanks that were attached to us.

1595
01:04:34.72 --> 01:04:35.64
I remember their call sign,

1596
01:04:35.64 --> 01:04:39.24
because it was public enemy, which was like a super,

1597
01:04:39.24 --> 01:04:41.12
like you're going to be like a tank guy.

1598
01:04:41.12 --> 01:04:42.48
That's like a, that's a cool.

1599
01:04:42.48 --> 01:04:43.32
That's a great call sign.

1600
01:04:43.32 --> 01:04:46.32
A great call sign, like public enemy.

1601
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:47.80
And you know, those guys would come through

1602
01:04:47.80 --> 01:04:49.72
and push the plows.

1603
01:04:49.72 --> 01:04:53.28
And just the air power, the amount of support

1604
01:04:53.28 --> 01:04:56.68
and being an 0-311, like on the ground,

1605
01:04:56.68 --> 01:04:59.48
I felt like I didn't even need a gun.

1606
01:04:59.48 --> 01:05:02.68
I mean, the kitchen sink was being thrown at these folks.

1607
01:05:02.68 --> 01:05:05.64
I mean, they were just, it was all on.

1608
01:05:05.64 --> 01:05:07.64
It was like a live fire exercise.

1609
01:05:07.64 --> 01:05:12.000
So when it kicked off, what was your platoon's mission?

1610
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.44
Breaching, getting through.

1611
01:05:14.44 --> 01:05:16.84
And then they had like on the other side of the mine belts

1612
01:05:16.84 --> 01:05:19.72
was defensive positions for the Iraqis.

1613
01:05:19.72 --> 01:05:23.64
So we all had certain objectives that we kind of had to hit.

1614
01:05:23.64 --> 01:05:25.28
And you know, just to get through the mine belts,

1615
01:05:25.28 --> 01:05:28.000
they thought it would take like days for us

1616
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.96
to get through the mine belts, not a couple of hours.

1617
01:05:31.96 --> 01:05:34.68
And then we had the Army's Tiger Brigade

1618
01:05:34.68 --> 01:05:35.92
that was following up.

1619
01:05:35.92 --> 01:05:38.72
They were the ones that were going to do the big left,

1620
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:40.96
the big left hook going up into Iraq with,

1621
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:44.76
I mean, I'd never seen so many Bradley's M1 Abrams.

1622
01:05:44.76 --> 01:05:47.76
Cause remember that's when the M1 came out, the Abram,

1623
01:05:47.76 --> 01:05:51.000
which that thing is, that's a bad ass piece of gear.

1624
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.96
And just, so we did the mine belts, they broke left,

1625
01:05:53.96 --> 01:05:55.56
they start heading up to Iraq.

1626
01:05:55.56 --> 01:05:59.08
And we're, when we hit the objectives

1627
01:05:59.08 --> 01:06:01.000
for our company objectives.

1628
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.72
And so these are like little Iraqi positions.

1629
01:06:03.72 --> 01:06:05.20
These were your company objectives.

1630
01:06:05.20 --> 01:06:07.44
Was like little pill boxes or whatever.

1631
01:06:07.44 --> 01:06:09.08
Yeah, if even that, I mean,

1632
01:06:09.08 --> 01:06:10.80
they had been sitting out there for so,

1633
01:06:10.80 --> 01:06:12.60
like we had these extravagant,

1634
01:06:12.60 --> 01:06:15.84
like what we thought we were going to encounter.

1635
01:06:15.84 --> 01:06:20.36
And then what we actually encountered were not the same.

1636
01:06:20.36 --> 01:06:22.96
Like some couple of sandbags and a dude with an AK.

1637
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:25.92
Yeah, I mean, and they were like in living quarters.

1638
01:06:25.92 --> 01:06:28.24
Like they had been out there so long, just like us.

1639
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:31.16
Like you're just trying to make your life comfortable.

1640
01:06:31.16 --> 01:06:33.32
So get some plywood, you know what I mean?

1641
01:06:33.32 --> 01:06:35.32
Dig a hole, put it over top of it.

1642
01:06:35.32 --> 01:06:36.16
You know what I mean?

1643
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:37.56
Make a nice little area.

1644
01:06:37.56 --> 01:06:41.000
You know, you can brew up ramen, you got your coffee,

1645
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:41.84
that kind of stuff.

1646
01:06:41.84 --> 01:06:43.36
They're just basically out there living.

1647
01:06:43.36 --> 01:06:47.20
And the frontline troops like weren't the Republican guard

1648
01:06:47.20 --> 01:06:49.52
guys, they had those guys behind them to make sure

1649
01:06:49.52 --> 01:06:51.32
that they didn't run away.

1650
01:06:52.92 --> 01:06:54.88
And so, you know, as soon as you start coming through,

1651
01:06:54.88 --> 01:06:56.96
it's basically we hit them and they were like,

1652
01:06:56.96 --> 01:06:58.16
They were like flags.

1653
01:06:58.16 --> 01:06:59.000
Oh yeah.

1654
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.36
I mean, because they were like,

1655
01:07:00.36 --> 01:07:01.96
oh my God, they're here already.

1656
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:06.96
You know, like their coffee pot was like still warm.

1657
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:07.80
You know what I mean?

1658
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:11.68
When we rolled in and then it was just a Rolex.

1659
01:07:11.68 --> 01:07:13.84
I mean, once we went through the, of course, you know,

1660
01:07:13.84 --> 01:07:15.68
everybody, you know, you're scared.

1661
01:07:15.68 --> 01:07:17.36
I mean, you know, when you're on the other side

1662
01:07:17.36 --> 01:07:19.68
of the mind belts and they're dropping artillery

1663
01:07:19.68 --> 01:07:21.16
and those sorts of things are coming on.

1664
01:07:21.16 --> 01:07:24.40
So you can hear the explosions, you know,

1665
01:07:24.40 --> 01:07:27.32
they set the oil fields on fire.

1666
01:07:27.32 --> 01:07:29.24
So you've just got like that oil fields

1667
01:07:29.24 --> 01:07:31.44
and the black smoke and all that kind of.

1668
01:07:31.44 --> 01:07:32.76
So it's like.

1669
01:07:32.76 --> 01:07:34.64
Were you freaking stoked?

1670
01:07:34.64 --> 01:07:38.40
Like, yeah, to be there and just like hell yeah.

1671
01:07:38.40 --> 01:07:39.24
Yeah.

1672
01:07:39.24 --> 01:07:40.92
And then let's get the hell out of here.

1673
01:07:40.92 --> 01:07:42.60
So then when, so how long did it take

1674
01:07:42.60 --> 01:07:44.96
before you got your objective secured?

1675
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:46.08
And then what'd you do?

1676
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:48.32
Then we loaded up straight to Kuwait.

1677
01:07:48.32 --> 01:07:50.20
I mean, and it was, it was just game on.

1678
01:07:50.20 --> 01:07:52.32
I mean, we, we, we rolled it.

1679
01:07:52.32 --> 01:07:56.24
That air war and that campaign that those folks did,

1680
01:07:56.24 --> 01:07:57.88
unbelievable.

1681
01:07:57.88 --> 01:08:02.88
I mean, it wasn't like a window pane left intact in Kuwait.

1682
01:08:02.88 --> 01:08:04.88
I mean, they, they, they, like I said,

1683
01:08:04.88 --> 01:08:06.80
they threw the kitchen sink at them.

1684
01:08:06.80 --> 01:08:09.48
I mean, the air power above us, even with our,

1685
01:08:09.48 --> 01:08:12.000
with our helicopter support, with Cobra's army,

1686
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.16
with their Apaches and then all the fast movers

1687
01:08:15.16 --> 01:08:16.000
and stuff over there.

1688
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.32
I mean, they just, there was a lot of craters.

1689
01:08:19.32 --> 01:08:22.000
That mile of death, cause I remember years later,

1690
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.60
probably like I think it was 93 or 94.

1691
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:27.60
I went to Kuwait and we were doing like training

1692
01:08:27.60 --> 01:08:29.84
and we drove up the mile death and there's still vehicles

1693
01:08:29.84 --> 01:08:32.08
all over the place that we just blasted.

1694
01:08:32.08 --> 01:08:33.08
Oh yeah.

1695
01:08:33.08 --> 01:08:35.44
And then, you know, then they, they want to make it look

1696
01:08:35.44 --> 01:08:38.52
like the Kuwaitis like had a part in it.

1697
01:08:38.52 --> 01:08:40.12
So then they're going to let them come back in

1698
01:08:40.12 --> 01:08:43.96
and shoot into the air and yeah, we took our country back

1699
01:08:43.96 --> 01:08:45.08
and all that kind of stuff.

1700
01:08:45.08 --> 01:08:47.12
But yeah, that place was a wreck.

1701
01:08:47.12 --> 01:08:50.32
It's amazing what it looks like now compared to,

1702
01:08:50.32 --> 01:08:53.04
I mean, they, they, they, they took the wood to it.

1703
01:08:53.04 --> 01:08:57.04
But it was, you know, of seeing that in 91

1704
01:08:57.04 --> 01:09:00.72
and just seeing the, the amount of power

1705
01:09:00.72 --> 01:09:05.72
the United States has is just unimaginable

1706
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.48
of what we can bring to bear.

1707
01:09:10.48 --> 01:09:12.88
But I look at the commanders that were those senior command,

1708
01:09:12.88 --> 01:09:14.60
you know, a few years later after that,

1709
01:09:14.60 --> 01:09:18.60
I read Colin Powell's autobiography, phenomenal individual,

1710
01:09:18.60 --> 01:09:20.60
phenomenal career.

1711
01:09:20.60 --> 01:09:23.76
But I look at those guys in the, in the leadership positions

1712
01:09:23.76 --> 01:09:26.08
of where they were and their careers

1713
01:09:26.08 --> 01:09:29.32
of what they had gone through, coming out of Vietnam

1714
01:09:29.32 --> 01:09:30.40
and seeing that kind of stuff.

1715
01:09:30.40 --> 01:09:35.28
So when, you know, now it's their turn to go.

1716
01:09:35.28 --> 01:09:37.12
I was very thankful for that.

1717
01:09:37.12 --> 01:09:40.08
But even the battalion commanders, you know,

1718
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:43.36
them having combat experience, you know what I mean?

1719
01:09:43.36 --> 01:09:46.000
It was, it was, it was a game changer for us

1720
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.40
to have somebody that, you know, directly looking out for you

1721
01:09:50.40 --> 01:09:52.56
that's been there, done that and has the T-shirt

1722
01:09:52.56 --> 01:09:54.16
and hat kind of aspect.

1723
01:09:54.16 --> 01:09:57.16
And, and they know what Wright looks like.

1724
01:09:57.16 --> 01:10:00.000
And the way they were as leaders, like I said,

1725
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.72
I mean, Tuchel Jones was, as the battalion commander,

1726
01:10:03.72 --> 01:10:08.72
he was, you know, just phenomenal as a leader

1727
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:10.84
because he was personal.

1728
01:10:10.84 --> 01:10:14.28
Like you felt like you had a relationship with the guy.

1729
01:10:14.28 --> 01:10:15.88
And, and of course, you know, he always had,

1730
01:10:15.88 --> 01:10:19.12
he loved sports, you know, it was big and with activities.

1731
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:20.84
So, you know, we had softball bats.

1732
01:10:20.84 --> 01:10:22.72
I played third base for his, you know,

1733
01:10:22.72 --> 01:10:24.92
for his battalion team, you know what I mean?

1734
01:10:24.92 --> 01:10:27.96
So third base and, you know, I got an arm.

1735
01:10:27.96 --> 01:10:28.80
You know what I mean?

1736
01:10:28.80 --> 01:10:29.68
Love playing.

1737
01:10:29.68 --> 01:10:32.28
Yeah, so it was like camp, you know what I mean?

1738
01:10:32.28 --> 01:10:34.88
Again, but we're in the middle of the desert.

1739
01:10:36.24 --> 01:10:39.000
Yeah, it's, it's, you know, you mentioned

1740
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.12
that you had these guys who were running the show.

1741
01:10:42.12 --> 01:10:45.20
And, you know, when we just had this Afghanistan pull out,

1742
01:10:45.20 --> 01:10:46.48
which is just a big disaster.

1743
01:10:46.48 --> 01:10:47.84
And you look at the entire,

1744
01:10:47.84 --> 01:10:51.68
the entire Afghanistan campaign and the Iraq campaign

1745
01:10:51.68 --> 01:10:54.24
that took place when I was in.

1746
01:10:54.24 --> 01:10:58.72
And, you know, did these people learn anything from Vietnam?

1747
01:11:00.08 --> 01:11:03.40
And then you look at how those guys handled the first Gulf War.

1748
01:11:03.40 --> 01:11:05.40
It's like, you know, they learned something from Vietnam.

1749
01:11:05.40 --> 01:11:07.36
Like, we're not going to do it like that.

1750
01:11:07.36 --> 01:11:10.68
We're going to go in there with overwhelming force.

1751
01:11:10.68 --> 01:11:13.32
I mean, overwhelming times five.

1752
01:11:13.32 --> 01:11:15.32
Like there's nothing's going to stop us.

1753
01:11:15.32 --> 01:11:17.88
And we're going to end up doing this in three days.

1754
01:11:17.88 --> 01:11:19.000
That's what's going to happen.

1755
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.32
And like you said, people go to those only 96 hours.

1756
01:11:22.32 --> 01:11:26.08
It's like, yes, exactly.

1757
01:11:26.08 --> 01:11:28.68
Yeah, I'm thankful for that.

1758
01:11:28.68 --> 01:11:33.08
You know, and, and that was a huge turn of point.

1759
01:11:33.08 --> 01:11:37.32
Of course, by then, you know, then I had known

1760
01:11:37.32 --> 01:11:40.16
when I came back that, you know, the Marine Corps,

1761
01:11:40.16 --> 01:11:41.92
this is, this is what I'm going to,

1762
01:11:41.92 --> 01:11:42.76
this is what I'm going to do.

1763
01:11:42.76 --> 01:11:44.60
I've got, you know, three deployments.

1764
01:11:45.52 --> 01:11:47.96
And then, you know, then they're looking at,

1765
01:11:47.96 --> 01:11:51.36
now you got to kind of diversify yourself a little bit.

1766
01:11:51.36 --> 01:11:54.32
So when I came back and I was a corporal.

1767
01:11:54.32 --> 01:11:55.84
Did you guys come back on a ship?

1768
01:11:55.84 --> 01:11:56.68
How'd you guys get back?

1769
01:11:56.68 --> 01:11:58.24
How'd you guys get back to America?

1770
01:11:58.24 --> 01:12:00.000
Because we were the first in.

1771
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.48
We got to be the first out.

1772
01:12:01.48 --> 01:12:05.68
And there was a call of all airlines worldwide

1773
01:12:05.68 --> 01:12:07.80
to come in to pick up troops to get them home.

1774
01:12:07.80 --> 01:12:12.16
We flew Hawaiian Airlines, which was,

1775
01:12:12.16 --> 01:12:13.80
which was pretty banging.

1776
01:12:13.80 --> 01:12:14.64
You know what I mean?

1777
01:12:14.64 --> 01:12:16.56
Being out, being gone for over nine months, you know,

1778
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:18.44
total because we were already on deployment

1779
01:12:18.44 --> 01:12:20.04
and got Taggurit.

1780
01:12:20.04 --> 01:12:24.20
And, you know, getting on the, on the big freedom birds

1781
01:12:24.20 --> 01:12:29.20
and we landed in, we flew over, we landed in,

1782
01:12:29.20 --> 01:12:32.52
in Ireland to refuel.

1783
01:12:32.52 --> 01:12:34.20
And then we landed in Maine.

1784
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:38.12
And when we landed in Maine, they let us get off the planes

1785
01:12:38.12 --> 01:12:41.48
and we all came back in and we were like the first,

1786
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:45.08
like troops back to hit US soil in Maine.

1787
01:12:45.08 --> 01:12:50.08
And man, the airport was, the walls were lined

1788
01:12:50.76 --> 01:12:52.88
with just, it seemed like the whole state of Maine

1789
01:12:52.88 --> 01:12:54.40
was at the airport.

1790
01:12:54.40 --> 01:12:55.24
You know what I mean?

1791
01:12:55.24 --> 01:12:58.32
Flags, they had tables out, food.

1792
01:12:58.32 --> 01:13:01.20
And, you know, the battalion commander, you know,

1793
01:13:01.20 --> 01:13:03.70
he's like, meet me at the bar.

1794
01:13:03.70 --> 01:13:05.32
And, you know, we go to the bar here.

1795
01:13:05.32 --> 01:13:07.84
It's probably not the smartest thing to do when, you know,

1796
01:13:07.84 --> 01:13:09.96
you've been sober for nine months

1797
01:13:09.96 --> 01:13:12.36
and now we're all going to go to the bar.

1798
01:13:12.36 --> 01:13:14.36
And, but I mean, the people in Maine,

1799
01:13:14.36 --> 01:13:16.48
for them coming out was huge.

1800
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:21.48
The support that we got coming back after that was amazing.

1801
01:13:21.68 --> 01:13:25.08
So we're there, they refuel, they put us back on the bird

1802
01:13:25.08 --> 01:13:28.36
and, you know, the stewardess just had to lock themselves

1803
01:13:28.36 --> 01:13:32.18
away because you got a bunch of stupid Marines

1804
01:13:32.18 --> 01:13:33.40
that have had a lot to drink.

1805
01:13:33.40 --> 01:13:35.96
You know, they got the little no smoking lamps coming on.

1806
01:13:35.96 --> 01:13:37.32
Dudes are burning cigarettes.

1807
01:13:37.32 --> 01:13:39.32
You know, there's no shits given.

1808
01:13:39.32 --> 01:13:43.000
We get down to Cherry Point and the bands down there,

1809
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.04
I mean, they're throwing 12 packs and beer

1810
01:13:46.04 --> 01:13:48.20
on the back of the five tons.

1811
01:13:48.20 --> 01:13:50.32
We're going back down to Lejeune.

1812
01:13:50.32 --> 01:13:54.000
It was, I mean, it was a great, great homecoming

1813
01:13:54.78 --> 01:13:56.60
to be able to come back.

1814
01:13:56.60 --> 01:14:01.60
And it was, it was phenomenal for that experience.

1815
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:06.40
And then I had to decide what I'm going to do next.

1816
01:14:06.40 --> 01:14:10.72
And I had one of my best friends, Doug Barry.

1817
01:14:10.72 --> 01:14:13.48
He lives just up the road here in San Diego.

1818
01:14:13.48 --> 01:14:17.40
We were together in First Battalion, six Marines.

1819
01:14:17.40 --> 01:14:21.72
And we both went over to await orders to go to the drill

1820
01:14:21.72 --> 01:14:24.76
field to become a drill instructor.

1821
01:14:25.68 --> 01:14:27.80
And just because, you know, I mean, the Marine Corps,

1822
01:14:27.80 --> 01:14:32.80
like the DI is a very iconic figure.

1823
01:14:32.84 --> 01:14:36.04
But the bigger reason is, is back then,

1824
01:14:36.04 --> 01:14:39.06
you only had to do two years on the drill field.

1825
01:14:39.06 --> 01:14:43.86
But if you went recruiting, you had to do three.

1826
01:14:43.86 --> 01:14:46.46
Well, the only thing I knew was I did not want

1827
01:14:46.46 --> 01:14:47.66
to be a recruiter.

1828
01:14:47.66 --> 01:14:50.98
Like that, you know, God bless them.

1829
01:14:50.98 --> 01:14:51.82
You know what I mean?

1830
01:14:51.82 --> 01:14:54.000
We've got the school right here at MCRD

1831
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.30
for Marine Corps of Recruiting.

1832
01:14:55.30 --> 01:14:57.50
And the guys are great at their job.

1833
01:14:57.50 --> 01:14:59.22
You know, the Marines put on the, you know,

1834
01:14:59.22 --> 01:15:02.06
the uniform, the way they look, the way they recruit.

1835
01:15:02.06 --> 01:15:05.74
I mean, we can propaganda with the best of them out there.

1836
01:15:05.74 --> 01:15:08.66
And so I wanted to go do the DI thing,

1837
01:15:08.66 --> 01:15:10.54
get the funny hat.

1838
01:15:10.54 --> 01:15:13.26
Plus it, you know, it would be fun.

1839
01:15:13.26 --> 01:15:14.58
And it was.

1840
01:15:15.86 --> 01:15:18.14
So how long is drill instructor school?

1841
01:15:18.14 --> 01:15:19.14
It's like three months.

1842
01:15:19.14 --> 01:15:20.62
It's kind of like you're going through boot camp,

1843
01:15:20.62 --> 01:15:21.70
but you got rank.

1844
01:15:24.26 --> 01:15:26.62
I imagine though, they must be like even harder

1845
01:15:26.62 --> 01:15:28.50
in boot than boot camp in some ways.

1846
01:15:28.50 --> 01:15:31.22
Cause you got to be so like perfect with everything.

1847
01:15:32.10 --> 01:15:37.10
Yeah. And it's learning like the drill manual verbatim.

1848
01:15:37.10 --> 01:15:42.10
It's the, from the mannerisms to just the command presence.

1849
01:15:42.66 --> 01:15:44.42
They teach you that.

1850
01:15:44.42 --> 01:15:46.86
Oh, can they take a guy that doesn't have any command

1851
01:15:46.86 --> 01:15:48.54
presence and they teach it to him?

1852
01:15:48.54 --> 01:15:50.22
Oh yeah. I mean, you're going to stand out there

1853
01:15:50.22 --> 01:15:51.70
and yell at a lot of trees.

1854
01:15:51.70 --> 01:15:52.54
You know what I mean?

1855
01:15:52.54 --> 01:15:54.18
It's like, if you ever go down there

1856
01:15:54.18 --> 01:15:56.54
and you like watch DI school and they're going through

1857
01:15:56.54 --> 01:15:58.06
DI school, you'll see dudes like,

1858
01:15:58.06 --> 01:15:59.74
what is he doing yelling?

1859
01:15:59.74 --> 01:16:02.30
And then he's just, what, at a tree.

1860
01:16:02.30 --> 01:16:04.70
Well, he's doing what's like, it's called a teach back

1861
01:16:04.70 --> 01:16:06.54
where you have to verbatim.

1862
01:16:06.54 --> 01:16:07.38
You know what I mean?

1863
01:16:07.38 --> 01:16:12.38
Like go back through for the different moves of drill.

1864
01:16:12.54 --> 01:16:14.34
And then, you know, from your mannerisms,

1865
01:16:14.34 --> 01:16:17.38
how you dress, how you look, your professionalism

1866
01:16:18.50 --> 01:16:23.14
of coming in is it is, it's a difficult school.

1867
01:16:23.14 --> 01:16:27.06
The uniforms are just, I mean, that's next level.

1868
01:16:28.18 --> 01:16:30.94
Because I wasn't like the best uniform guy.

1869
01:16:30.94 --> 01:16:31.78
You know what I mean?

1870
01:16:31.78 --> 01:16:35.30
Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't like, I didn't even own dress blues.

1871
01:16:35.30 --> 01:16:37.70
Like, cause you had to buy them back then if you wanted them.

1872
01:16:37.70 --> 01:16:40.34
And I was like, why don't I want to buy them?

1873
01:16:40.34 --> 01:16:41.18
You know what I mean?

1874
01:16:41.18 --> 01:16:44.38
I like the alphas, the greens.

1875
01:16:44.38 --> 01:16:45.58
So I just had alphas.

1876
01:16:45.58 --> 01:16:46.42
I never had the blues.

1877
01:16:46.42 --> 01:16:47.42
They didn't issue them to me.

1878
01:16:47.42 --> 01:16:48.70
And you know what I mean?

1879
01:16:48.70 --> 01:16:49.66
I'm cool with that.

1880
01:16:49.66 --> 01:16:52.86
I didn't join to get dressed blues.

1881
01:16:52.86 --> 01:16:55.62
I joined for the camis and the rifle free ammo,

1882
01:16:55.62 --> 01:16:57.90
that kind of stuff, travel the world.

1883
01:16:57.90 --> 01:16:59.98
So when I got there, the uniforms were difficult.

1884
01:16:59.98 --> 01:17:02.58
The PT was really good, but it was,

1885
01:17:02.58 --> 01:17:04.62
it was more of the structure of everything

1886
01:17:04.62 --> 01:17:06.70
that they do to you at the iSchool.

1887
01:17:06.70 --> 01:17:09.10
You can use it when you become a drill instructor.

1888
01:17:09.10 --> 01:17:10.42
So they're going to do stuff to you

1889
01:17:10.42 --> 01:17:12.38
that then you can turn around and.

1890
01:17:12.38 --> 01:17:13.22
Mark what?

1891
01:17:14.42 --> 01:17:16.30
Like on the training schedule of like,

1892
01:17:16.30 --> 01:17:21.30
of probably the biggest misconception of Marine Corps

1893
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:26.06
and boot camps, everybody thinks it's like hands on.

1894
01:17:26.06 --> 01:17:28.10
Like, you know, oh, you're going to get beat.

1895
01:17:28.10 --> 01:17:28.94
They're going to put their hands on.

1896
01:17:28.94 --> 01:17:29.78
I mean like physically.

1897
01:17:29.78 --> 01:17:30.62
Physically.

1898
01:17:30.62 --> 01:17:32.70
Yeah. I mean, and you learn there that,

1899
01:17:32.70 --> 01:17:35.82
you know, you don't have to hit them to hurt them.

1900
01:17:35.82 --> 01:17:36.66
You know what I mean?

1901
01:17:36.66 --> 01:17:37.78
It's a one arms distance.

1902
01:17:37.78 --> 01:17:39.06
Nothing has changed.

1903
01:17:39.06 --> 01:17:42.10
If you need to put your hands on somebody,

1904
01:17:42.10 --> 01:17:44.22
then you've lost leadership.

1905
01:17:44.22 --> 01:17:45.06
You know what I mean?

1906
01:17:45.06 --> 01:17:47.34
If you have to go to the physical force,

1907
01:17:48.22 --> 01:17:50.62
but you know, just in your mannerism

1908
01:17:50.62 --> 01:17:54.50
and the shock and awe of just the voice

1909
01:17:54.50 --> 01:17:57.22
can just intimidate people.

1910
01:17:57.22 --> 01:18:01.82
It's mainly as your voice, the smoky brings a lot to bear.

1911
01:18:01.82 --> 01:18:05.06
And then just your physical fitness level.

1912
01:18:05.06 --> 01:18:05.90
You know what I mean?

1913
01:18:05.90 --> 01:18:06.82
Cause as a recruit, you're like,

1914
01:18:06.82 --> 01:18:08.26
this guy like sweat.

1915
01:18:08.26 --> 01:18:10.26
Like this guy doesn't get tired.

1916
01:18:10.26 --> 01:18:13.66
I mean, these guys are just animals.

1917
01:18:13.66 --> 01:18:16.50
And it is, it's a lot of, it's a lot of hard work.

1918
01:18:16.50 --> 01:18:19.26
It's a lot of long hours,

1919
01:18:19.26 --> 01:18:23.38
but it is very rewarding when,

1920
01:18:23.38 --> 01:18:27.18
when you get the recruits have come in and it's fun.

1921
01:18:27.18 --> 01:18:30.78
Cause now you're like a live character on Saturday Night Live.

1922
01:18:30.78 --> 01:18:31.86
I mean, some of the stuff,

1923
01:18:31.86 --> 01:18:33.30
that's why you got the big smoky.

1924
01:18:33.30 --> 01:18:36.34
And so you can drop it so they can't see you laughing.

1925
01:18:36.34 --> 01:18:39.14
Because I mean, some of the stuff that you see

1926
01:18:39.14 --> 01:18:41.34
that recruits do, you know, I was like,

1927
01:18:41.34 --> 01:18:42.78
yeah, I'd be with some of the other hats

1928
01:18:42.78 --> 01:18:45.10
cause that's what you call a DI hat.

1929
01:18:45.10 --> 01:18:46.54
And I, you'd be one of the hats was like,

1930
01:18:46.54 --> 01:18:48.86
dude, there's no way I was this stupid when I was here.

1931
01:18:48.86 --> 01:18:50.42
And you're like, yeah, you were,

1932
01:18:50.42 --> 01:18:54.22
you were just as dumb as these kids are that are coming in.

1933
01:18:54.22 --> 01:18:57.66
And they just do funny, they do funny stuff.

1934
01:18:57.66 --> 01:19:00.78
And then as, as a drill instructor, when,

1935
01:19:00.78 --> 01:19:03.38
when you get these kids on the yellow footprints

1936
01:19:03.38 --> 01:19:06.58
and then in a three month period,

1937
01:19:06.58 --> 01:19:09.22
when their parents come down for graduation

1938
01:19:09.22 --> 01:19:10.82
and you're marching them up there

1939
01:19:10.82 --> 01:19:14.30
and it's parents day, Thursday afternoon at Paris Island.

1940
01:19:14.30 --> 01:19:17.82
And, and all the parents are excited to see their kids.

1941
01:19:17.82 --> 01:19:18.66
Excuse me.

1942
01:19:18.66 --> 01:19:23.46
And when the parents have to come over and ask you like,

1943
01:19:23.46 --> 01:19:24.92
which one's mine?

1944
01:19:26.30 --> 01:19:27.14
You know what I mean?

1945
01:19:27.14 --> 01:19:28.18
Looking at them like,

1946
01:19:28.18 --> 01:19:30.54
did you've had that kid for like 18 years

1947
01:19:30.54 --> 01:19:33.18
and you don't know which one's yours?

1948
01:19:33.18 --> 01:19:35.38
You know, the transformation when they get to go out

1949
01:19:35.38 --> 01:19:38.02
with their parents, the drill instructors get to meet

1950
01:19:38.02 --> 01:19:41.26
the parents that night when they bring the kids back

1951
01:19:41.26 --> 01:19:42.46
to the squad bay.

1952
01:19:42.46 --> 01:19:44.26
And the parents are just like,

1953
01:19:44.26 --> 01:19:46.50
how did you do this in three months?

1954
01:19:46.50 --> 01:19:48.34
He's saying, yes, sir, yes, man,

1955
01:19:48.34 --> 01:19:51.06
he's holding doors open, like he's sitting up straight

1956
01:19:51.06 --> 01:19:52.30
at the table.

1957
01:19:52.30 --> 01:19:53.14
You know what I mean?

1958
01:19:53.14 --> 01:19:54.82
Like what you all did to this,

1959
01:19:54.82 --> 01:19:57.78
who our son is just incredible.

1960
01:19:57.78 --> 01:20:00.26
It's a great weight loss program.

1961
01:20:00.26 --> 01:20:01.10
You know what I mean?

1962
01:20:01.10 --> 01:20:02.46
Like folks show up, you know what I mean?

1963
01:20:02.46 --> 01:20:04.06
They look like a sea bag with lips,

1964
01:20:04.06 --> 01:20:06.18
chewed up bubble gum and you know what I mean?

1965
01:20:06.18 --> 01:20:08.66
Three months later, they're fighting lava monsters.

1966
01:20:08.66 --> 01:20:11.70
I mean, they look like they're straight out of 300.

1967
01:20:13.06 --> 01:20:17.02
And so that's very rewarding of seeing some of those,

1968
01:20:17.02 --> 01:20:19.34
some of those kids just, and you know,

1969
01:20:19.34 --> 01:20:20.18
in the Marine Corps, man,

1970
01:20:20.18 --> 01:20:21.90
we then we're gonna put that emblem on them

1971
01:20:21.90 --> 01:20:22.90
for the rest of their life.

1972
01:20:22.90 --> 01:20:26.86
I mean, they've joined a great institution.

1973
01:20:26.86 --> 01:20:28.98
You know, once a Marine, always a Marine,

1974
01:20:28.98 --> 01:20:31.62
you know, we're gonna bring the families in.

1975
01:20:31.62 --> 01:20:34.58
We're gonna mom, dad, they're gonna buy the t-shirts,

1976
01:20:34.58 --> 01:20:37.26
the hats, they're gonna fly the flags.

1977
01:20:37.26 --> 01:20:39.42
The Marine Corps does a, in my opinion,

1978
01:20:39.42 --> 01:20:43.54
we do a really good job of bringing in the entire family.

1979
01:20:43.54 --> 01:20:44.38
Like, you know, I mean,

1980
01:20:44.38 --> 01:20:46.38
you'll see the stickers on the backs of cars,

1981
01:20:46.38 --> 01:20:50.18
my son's a US Marine, my daughter's a US Marine.

1982
01:20:50.18 --> 01:20:53.42
I mean, we got my grandson,

1983
01:20:53.42 --> 01:20:56.46
I mean, we bring in the whole family

1984
01:20:56.46 --> 01:20:58.14
to support that kid while he's, you know,

1985
01:20:58.14 --> 01:21:00.22
to service to country, which is huge.

1986
01:21:00.22 --> 01:21:01.78
When you're a drill instructor,

1987
01:21:01.78 --> 01:21:04.22
or you're a drill instructor at school,

1988
01:21:04.22 --> 01:21:06.26
are they talking you through sort of like

1989
01:21:06.26 --> 01:21:11.26
the psychological why behind this aspect of training

1990
01:21:11.46 --> 01:21:13.66
or this aspect of treatment?

1991
01:21:13.66 --> 01:21:15.70
For instance, when I went to OCS,

1992
01:21:15.70 --> 01:21:16.98
you know, I had Marine Corps drill instructor,

1993
01:21:16.98 --> 01:21:20.66
awesome guy, awesome drill instructor,

1994
01:21:20.66 --> 01:21:24.30
but at some point he told us stuff at the end, you know,

1995
01:21:24.30 --> 01:21:26.94
and it was, honestly, I think I was asking a lot of questions

1996
01:21:26.94 --> 01:21:28.62
because I wanted to understand better,

1997
01:21:28.62 --> 01:21:30.58
but for instance, when you get to OCS,

1998
01:21:30.58 --> 01:21:32.22
you can't look at your food.

1999
01:21:32.22 --> 01:21:35.50
You have to, they call it squaring your meals.

2000
01:21:35.50 --> 01:21:37.98
And I was like, hey, what, why are we doing that?

2001
01:21:37.98 --> 01:21:40.38
And he goes, well, that comes from when we treat,

2002
01:21:40.38 --> 01:21:42.18
when we used to just train pilots,

2003
01:21:42.18 --> 01:21:44.06
they had to learn to use their peripheral vision

2004
01:21:44.06 --> 01:21:45.02
so they could see their instruments

2005
01:21:45.02 --> 01:21:46.14
while they're looking around.

2006
01:21:46.14 --> 01:21:47.90
Okay, that makes sense.

2007
01:21:47.90 --> 01:21:48.98
Hey, why do we gotta yell at you?

2008
01:21:48.98 --> 01:21:50.70
Cause you gotta speak in a ballistic tone,

2009
01:21:50.70 --> 01:21:51.82
which means you gotta yell everything.

2010
01:21:51.82 --> 01:21:54.06
I'm like, what's the reason behind that?

2011
01:21:54.06 --> 01:21:56.78
He says, well, you know, we get these young ensigns in here

2012
01:21:56.78 --> 01:21:58.94
that are going to go on, be on board a ship,

2013
01:21:58.94 --> 01:22:00.10
they're gonna be on the bridge,

2014
01:22:00.10 --> 01:22:02.86
and they're gonna have to give orders on the bridge

2015
01:22:02.86 --> 01:22:04.58
in a simple, clear, concise manner.

2016
01:22:04.58 --> 01:22:06.14
They can't be hesitant.

2017
01:22:06.14 --> 01:22:07.46
They gotta think before they say,

2018
01:22:07.46 --> 01:22:08.94
but then they gotta say it with a commanding voice

2019
01:22:08.94 --> 01:22:12.90
so that people actually hear them and then can execute.

2020
01:22:12.90 --> 01:22:14.54
So there's things going on

2021
01:22:14.54 --> 01:22:17.18
that there's a pragmatic reason behind,

2022
01:22:17.18 --> 01:22:19.10
but did they ever break that down for you?

2023
01:22:19.10 --> 01:22:21.62
For instance, you know, you can go watch on YouTube,

2024
01:22:21.62 --> 01:22:23.82
you can go watch like the Welcome Abored,

2025
01:22:24.78 --> 01:22:26.02
not like the first night,

2026
01:22:26.02 --> 01:22:27.22
but maybe it's the second day

2027
01:22:27.22 --> 01:22:31.58
where the Marines, they have a very preplanned script

2028
01:22:31.58 --> 01:22:33.82
that they're saying about, you know,

2029
01:22:33.82 --> 01:22:36.14
this is the Marine Corps, this is what we're doing.

2030
01:22:36.14 --> 01:22:41.14
Do they break stuff down at a psychological level for you?

2031
01:22:41.14 --> 01:22:43.62
Because what you just said about the Marine Corps

2032
01:22:43.62 --> 01:22:46.62
doing it very well, I mean, I don't know if there's anyone

2033
01:22:46.62 --> 01:22:48.38
that does it better than the Marine Corps.

2034
01:22:48.38 --> 01:22:51.26
I mean, in the world, I don't know if there's any group

2035
01:22:51.26 --> 01:22:56.26
that has a stronger culture than the Marine Corps

2036
01:22:56.26 --> 01:23:00.26
that takes normal human beings from literally everywhere

2037
01:23:00.26 --> 01:23:02.90
and every strata of the United States of America

2038
01:23:02.90 --> 01:23:04.74
and sometimes other parts of the world

2039
01:23:04.74 --> 01:23:08.38
and turns them into this cohesive unit.

2040
01:23:08.38 --> 01:23:09.78
I don't know if there's anyone

2041
01:23:09.78 --> 01:23:12.26
that does it better, but do they break it down?

2042
01:23:12.26 --> 01:23:15.70
Do they say, hey, here's the reason why we do this right here?

2043
01:23:15.70 --> 01:23:18.82
Like even basic SEAL training, you know, they're like,

2044
01:23:18.82 --> 01:23:21.10
oh, what is Hell Week for?

2045
01:23:21.10 --> 01:23:22.26
What is it for?

2046
01:23:22.26 --> 01:23:23.70
And there's people that can answer that question,

2047
01:23:23.70 --> 01:23:25.30
well, here's what's gonna happen.

2048
01:23:25.30 --> 01:23:27.70
You know, this is what you're gonna have guys

2049
01:23:27.70 --> 01:23:30.26
that are gonna quit on the second day

2050
01:23:30.26 --> 01:23:31.98
and those are the people that blah, blah,

2051
01:23:31.98 --> 01:23:34.62
and they've done all this sort of psychological background

2052
01:23:34.62 --> 01:23:35.42
on it.

2053
01:23:35.42 --> 01:23:38.90
Is there anything like that when you become a Marine Corps

2054
01:23:38.90 --> 01:23:41.50
drill instructor that you understand the why?

2055
01:23:41.50 --> 01:23:45.74
Or is it just this is what we know works?

2056
01:23:46.78 --> 01:23:50.98
Yeah, a lot of it has to do with this is what works,

2057
01:23:50.98 --> 01:23:53.62
but at the same time, everything is done, like you said,

2058
01:23:53.62 --> 01:23:55.02
that you have squaring your meals.

2059
01:23:55.02 --> 01:23:58.46
Like everything is for a reason.

2060
01:23:58.46 --> 01:24:01.98
And it's also, you know, when we hand this recruit over

2061
01:24:01.98 --> 01:24:04.22
to this, you know, commissioned officer,

2062
01:24:04.22 --> 01:24:06.98
it's instant obedience to orders.

2063
01:24:06.98 --> 01:24:09.74
I mean, these guys, they're, I mean,

2064
01:24:09.74 --> 01:24:12.66
they do it better than anybody.

2065
01:24:12.66 --> 01:24:15.34
For instance, obedience, but when you talk about like

2066
01:24:15.34 --> 01:24:19.18
the psychological aspects, I was also, I was a swim hat.

2067
01:24:19.18 --> 01:24:21.78
So I was a Marine Combat Instructor water survival.

2068
01:24:21.78 --> 01:24:26.78
So I was a swim instructor, basically, for the Marine Corps.

2069
01:24:26.78 --> 01:24:31.38
And, you know, because of the kids that we recruit

2070
01:24:31.38 --> 01:24:34.02
like myself, they can't put that Marine has something

2071
01:24:34.02 --> 01:24:36.58
to do with aquatics in it for some reason.

2072
01:24:36.58 --> 01:24:37.42
You know what I mean?

2073
01:24:37.42 --> 01:24:38.90
Like the recruiters don't like let them know

2074
01:24:38.90 --> 01:24:41.86
that, hey, when you get down there, you got to swim.

2075
01:24:42.82 --> 01:24:44.30
I mean, we get, like you said, I mean,

2076
01:24:44.30 --> 01:24:46.22
we get kids from all over the planet

2077
01:24:46.22 --> 01:24:48.54
that have never, the largest body of water

2078
01:24:48.54 --> 01:24:50.90
they've ever seen is the pool tank

2079
01:24:50.90 --> 01:24:52.94
at Parris Island, South Carolina.

2080
01:24:52.94 --> 01:24:56.30
I mean, they've never been in a body of water that big.

2081
01:24:56.30 --> 01:24:58.42
And we don't ask them if they can swim.

2082
01:24:59.66 --> 01:25:01.38
Like nobody's, you know, the drill instructor

2083
01:25:01.38 --> 01:25:03.34
doesn't come out, hey, anybody not swim?

2084
01:25:03.34 --> 01:25:04.66
You can stand over here to the side.

2085
01:25:04.66 --> 01:25:06.54
We just, you know, strap their gear on them

2086
01:25:06.54 --> 01:25:07.38
you know what I mean?

2087
01:25:07.38 --> 01:25:09.22
So give them a rifle, put a helmet on them.

2088
01:25:09.22 --> 01:25:12.26
They're wearing their boots and they're all like, you know,

2089
01:25:12.26 --> 01:25:15.54
A to B, right next to the 10 foot tower

2090
01:25:15.54 --> 01:25:17.86
and we're going to give them the swim brief

2091
01:25:17.86 --> 01:25:20.50
and we're going to take them up on the 10 foot tower

2092
01:25:20.50 --> 01:25:22.58
and ask them to take a 30 inch step

2093
01:25:22.58 --> 01:25:25.58
and do the deep end and swim 25 meters.

2094
01:25:25.58 --> 01:25:27.42
And when you're sitting there, look,

2095
01:25:27.42 --> 01:25:30.62
you know who the recruits are that can't swim.

2096
01:25:30.62 --> 01:25:32.42
Because they're probably looking around going,

2097
01:25:32.42 --> 01:25:34.06
is anybody going to ask?

2098
01:25:34.06 --> 01:25:36.50
Like nobody there is not going to ask.

2099
01:25:36.50 --> 01:25:37.90
And when you look at it,

2100
01:25:37.90 --> 01:25:40.82
is we just want to see if they're going to step.

2101
01:25:40.82 --> 01:25:43.94
If they can overcome fear, you know,

2102
01:25:43.94 --> 01:25:47.94
if an individual can't overcome the fear or trust,

2103
01:25:47.94 --> 01:25:51.22
I mean, there's a drill instructor in the water

2104
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:55.22
waiting for you like no one has drowned in this trend.

2105
01:25:55.22 --> 01:25:57.70
Like it's, you know, it's the instructors

2106
01:25:57.70 --> 01:26:01.14
that are there, very professional, very well run.

2107
01:26:01.14 --> 01:26:04.66
And when you see this young man or young woman,

2108
01:26:04.66 --> 01:26:05.50
you know what I mean?

2109
01:26:05.50 --> 01:26:06.94
They're going to bounce the tower that knows

2110
01:26:06.94 --> 01:26:09.06
that they can't swim a day in their life.

2111
01:26:09.06 --> 01:26:12.46
And but they're going to trust the instructors

2112
01:26:12.46 --> 01:26:16.02
and the Marine Corps that we're going to take care of you.

2113
01:26:16.02 --> 01:26:18.06
They just have to step 30 inch step.

2114
01:26:18.06 --> 01:26:19.90
They hit the water, they come up, you know,

2115
01:26:19.90 --> 01:26:21.70
they're throwing up stuff from the third grade.

2116
01:26:21.70 --> 01:26:22.94
They got snot coming out.

2117
01:26:22.94 --> 01:26:23.78
They're straight to the,

2118
01:26:23.78 --> 01:26:27.42
they don't even make it even close to swimming at all.

2119
01:26:27.42 --> 01:26:29.22
They're just a rock in the water.

2120
01:26:29.22 --> 01:26:30.62
We take them over to the side.

2121
01:26:30.62 --> 01:26:32.66
We strip them all the way down into their, you know,

2122
01:26:32.66 --> 01:26:37.06
their PT shorts and we take them down to the shallow end

2123
01:26:37.06 --> 01:26:39.86
and we teach them how to swim.

2124
01:26:39.86 --> 01:26:40.70
You know what I mean?

2125
01:26:40.70 --> 01:26:42.86
It's a life skill.

2126
01:26:42.86 --> 01:26:45.26
And, you know, there's nothing greater than when you're,

2127
01:26:45.26 --> 01:26:46.90
you know, because, and it's not necessarily, you know,

2128
01:26:46.90 --> 01:26:49.22
maybe their parents just,

2129
01:26:49.22 --> 01:26:50.42
we don't know their background,

2130
01:26:50.42 --> 01:26:51.50
how they were raised like for me.

2131
01:26:51.50 --> 01:26:53.26
I don't remember learning how to swim.

2132
01:26:53.26 --> 01:26:55.14
I could just swim.

2133
01:26:55.14 --> 01:26:58.14
You know, a lot of those kids just don't have that advantage

2134
01:26:58.14 --> 01:27:00.86
and we take them down there to the shallow end of the pool

2135
01:27:00.86 --> 01:27:03.06
and we teach them the survival strokes.

2136
01:27:03.06 --> 01:27:04.78
And in a couple of weeks, you know,

2137
01:27:04.78 --> 01:27:06.38
like if they've got different training,

2138
01:27:06.38 --> 01:27:09.66
they got to come back to the pool and do remediation

2139
01:27:09.66 --> 01:27:11.86
until we can get them to pass and they can swim.

2140
01:27:11.86 --> 01:27:14.74
When you see the confidence level in a kid,

2141
01:27:14.74 --> 01:27:17.98
now that he can like swim and he passed that,

2142
01:27:17.98 --> 01:27:20.38
I mean, this guy's going to go through brick walls.

2143
01:27:20.38 --> 01:27:22.94
His fear is gone.

2144
01:27:22.94 --> 01:27:26.54
You know, there's nothing this kid cannot accomplish now.

2145
01:27:26.54 --> 01:27:27.54
I mean, it's just amazing.

2146
01:27:27.54 --> 01:27:28.62
You could see it in them.

2147
01:27:28.62 --> 01:27:30.22
I mean, you know, if you've ever like seen someone,

2148
01:27:30.22 --> 01:27:33.42
they accomplished something just of a small task

2149
01:27:33.42 --> 01:27:35.54
of like swimming 25 meters.

2150
01:27:35.54 --> 01:27:38.82
Like it's really not that big of a deal.

2151
01:27:38.82 --> 01:27:42.62
But to that kid, huge life changing event.

2152
01:27:42.62 --> 01:27:44.78
How often, what's the attrition rate

2153
01:27:44.78 --> 01:27:45.98
of Marine Corps boot camp?

2154
01:27:48.82 --> 01:27:50.42
Ah, you know.

2155
01:27:50.42 --> 01:27:52.90
How many guys would you lose, you know,

2156
01:27:52.90 --> 01:27:54.50
what are you in charge of there?

2157
01:27:54.50 --> 01:27:55.34
A platoon?

2158
01:27:55.34 --> 01:27:56.50
Yeah, so you got a platoon.

2159
01:27:56.50 --> 01:27:58.46
So, you know, depending on the time of the year,

2160
01:27:58.46 --> 01:28:01.14
you might have, you know, between 50 to 70 kids

2161
01:28:01.14 --> 01:28:05.10
that are in a platoon and you might lose 15 to 20 of them.

2162
01:28:05.10 --> 01:28:06.78
But a lot of them, you know, it's injuries.

2163
01:28:06.78 --> 01:28:08.58
So they're going to get recycled out.

2164
01:28:08.58 --> 01:28:11.38
Yeah, they're just going to get recycled and rolled.

2165
01:28:11.38 --> 01:28:14.78
They go to what, like if you come in, like, you know,

2166
01:28:14.78 --> 01:28:16.82
when you first get down there, you know,

2167
01:28:16.82 --> 01:28:19.42
and it's no offense to recruiters or anything like that,

2168
01:28:19.42 --> 01:28:21.62
but you know, the kids are supposed to be able to have

2169
01:28:21.62 --> 01:28:24.82
completed somewhat of a physical task prior to coming.

2170
01:28:24.82 --> 01:28:27.62
So they can at least like pull themselves up

2171
01:28:27.62 --> 01:28:30.74
out of a wet paper bag at least like once

2172
01:28:30.74 --> 01:28:32.82
before they get there.

2173
01:28:32.82 --> 01:28:34.66
You know, it's that whole preparation thing.

2174
01:28:34.66 --> 01:28:36.22
And some of the kids, you know, we send them

2175
01:28:36.22 --> 01:28:38.58
to PCP physical conditioning platoon

2176
01:28:38.58 --> 01:28:40.22
because some of them show up.

2177
01:28:40.22 --> 01:28:42.22
And they're just not really prepared.

2178
01:28:42.22 --> 01:28:45.10
And when you kind of look at that, it's not really the kid.

2179
01:28:45.10 --> 01:28:47.78
You know, the kid just read a pamphlet, you know what I mean?

2180
01:28:47.78 --> 01:28:50.94
He wants to come in and that's somebody's son or daughter.

2181
01:28:53.26 --> 01:28:54.10
You know what I mean?

2182
01:28:54.10 --> 01:28:56.62
That they think that's the greatest thing since sliced bread.

2183
01:28:56.62 --> 01:28:58.18
You know, to be a Marine, I mean,

2184
01:28:58.18 --> 01:29:00.50
you only got to do three pull ups.

2185
01:29:00.50 --> 01:29:02.78
I mean, you only got to run three miles and 28 minutes.

2186
01:29:02.78 --> 01:29:05.34
I mean, it's not like we're, we're banging it, you know,

2187
01:29:05.34 --> 01:29:06.90
in the main of like something that's just like

2188
01:29:06.90 --> 01:29:10.22
incredibly difficult, but to some people,

2189
01:29:10.22 --> 01:29:12.50
three pull ups is that's the most I've ever done

2190
01:29:12.50 --> 01:29:13.34
in their life.

2191
01:29:13.34 --> 01:29:15.06
And so, you know, we've got those,

2192
01:29:15.06 --> 01:29:17.74
we've got medical rehabilitation platoon.

2193
01:29:17.74 --> 01:29:21.30
So if the guys get rolled back, it's very rare.

2194
01:29:21.30 --> 01:29:22.14
You know what I mean?

2195
01:29:22.14 --> 01:29:23.34
Like you can try to drop.

2196
01:29:23.34 --> 01:29:26.38
I mean, we do drop kids that get sent off the island

2197
01:29:26.38 --> 01:29:29.10
and it's just because they're just not conforming.

2198
01:29:29.10 --> 01:29:30.98
What about just straight quitters?

2199
01:29:30.98 --> 01:29:33.90
Like it's cold or it's hot or it's too far.

2200
01:29:34.82 --> 01:29:35.82
You're going to send them down.

2201
01:29:35.82 --> 01:29:38.46
Everybody's got like a series commander.

2202
01:29:38.46 --> 01:29:41.50
So you have an officer to kind of keep a look over

2203
01:29:41.50 --> 01:29:43.94
what's happening in cell block.

2204
01:29:43.94 --> 01:29:44.78
You know what I mean?

2205
01:29:44.78 --> 01:29:46.98
And they have to go down and they'll get an interview

2206
01:29:46.98 --> 01:29:50.02
with that, you know, a Marine captain.

2207
01:29:50.02 --> 01:29:52.10
He's a series commander and he's going to try to talk

2208
01:29:52.10 --> 01:29:53.54
that kid in to stay in.

2209
01:29:53.54 --> 01:29:54.86
Like, hey, you know what, man?

2210
01:29:54.86 --> 01:29:56.74
The drill starts really aren't that bad.

2211
01:29:56.74 --> 01:29:57.58
You know what I mean?

2212
01:29:57.58 --> 01:29:58.58
Because it's all a numbers game.

2213
01:29:58.58 --> 01:29:59.42
You know what I mean?

2214
01:29:59.42 --> 01:30:01.22
Like in the end, the Marine Corps needs

2215
01:30:01.22 --> 01:30:03.50
a certain amount of numbers.

2216
01:30:03.50 --> 01:30:05.58
So he's going to try to talk the kid back in.

2217
01:30:05.58 --> 01:30:07.66
And that's like a lot of times with the platoon commander

2218
01:30:07.66 --> 01:30:08.94
or the, you know, the series commanders

2219
01:30:08.94 --> 01:30:10.70
that you have down there, you're like,

2220
01:30:10.70 --> 01:30:12.06
you got to be shit me, sir.

2221
01:30:12.06 --> 01:30:13.54
You're going to send this kid back.

2222
01:30:13.54 --> 01:30:16.74
Man, like, God, you know, this guy is just,

2223
01:30:16.74 --> 01:30:18.50
this kid's incredible.

2224
01:30:18.50 --> 01:30:20.58
And he's just like, you just work with him.

2225
01:30:20.58 --> 01:30:21.42
You know what I mean?

2226
01:30:21.42 --> 01:30:23.14
Just, you know, leadership challenge.

2227
01:30:23.14 --> 01:30:23.98
I hate that.

2228
01:30:23.98 --> 01:30:24.82
You know what I mean?

2229
01:30:24.82 --> 01:30:26.46
Like, that's the last thing I need

2230
01:30:26.46 --> 01:30:28.86
in the middle of bootcamp is my leadership challenge.

2231
01:30:28.86 --> 01:30:31.62
But in the end, I mean, you know,

2232
01:30:31.62 --> 01:30:33.82
for the most part one, when you look at it,

2233
01:30:33.82 --> 01:30:36.22
they're joining the United States Marine Corps.

2234
01:30:36.22 --> 01:30:40.06
So you look across America, like, who else is joining?

2235
01:30:40.06 --> 01:30:40.90
You know what I mean?

2236
01:30:40.90 --> 01:30:43.74
So at least the kid signed on a dotted line

2237
01:30:43.74 --> 01:30:46.66
and he's going to come and provide service to his country.

2238
01:30:46.66 --> 01:30:48.50
Which is, that's pretty incredible.

2239
01:30:49.86 --> 01:30:52.26
Just in that aspect.

2240
01:30:52.26 --> 01:30:54.70
But some of them just, you know, psychologically,

2241
01:30:54.70 --> 01:30:57.30
they just, they're not mentally tough enough

2242
01:30:57.30 --> 01:30:59.10
and they're going to do whatever it takes

2243
01:30:59.10 --> 01:31:01.70
to get off of that island.

2244
01:31:01.70 --> 01:31:03.78
And we're going to do whatever it takes

2245
01:31:03.78 --> 01:31:06.46
to help them get off of that island.

2246
01:31:06.46 --> 01:31:09.70
You know, it's a lot of fun.

2247
01:31:10.90 --> 01:31:14.14
But, you know, the rifle range is usually

2248
01:31:14.14 --> 01:31:17.02
a pretty big deal, you know, every brain's a rifleman.

2249
01:31:17.02 --> 01:31:19.02
But, you know, we're just looking, you know, marksmen.

2250
01:31:19.02 --> 01:31:22.30
How many can get across the qualification lines?

2251
01:31:22.30 --> 01:31:23.14
That kind of thing.

2252
01:31:23.14 --> 01:31:24.66
So the marksmanship package, you know what I mean?

2253
01:31:24.66 --> 01:31:26.10
There's a two week package down there.

2254
01:31:26.10 --> 01:31:27.30
I think it's pretty good.

2255
01:31:27.30 --> 01:31:28.66
It's a pretty good marksmanship package

2256
01:31:28.66 --> 01:31:30.62
that the Marine Corps puts on.

2257
01:31:30.62 --> 01:31:32.70
You know, for us shooting them back at 500

2258
01:31:32.70 --> 01:31:36.22
with, you know, Green Tip 556, that's not great ammo.

2259
01:31:36.22 --> 01:31:38.54
It's a pretty big accomplishment.

2260
01:31:38.54 --> 01:31:40.50
And then, you know, just the aspects

2261
01:31:40.50 --> 01:31:43.70
of when those kids graduate from Parris Island.

2262
01:31:44.62 --> 01:31:45.46
You know what I mean?

2263
01:31:45.46 --> 01:31:48.94
They look like they're ready to just strap on the world.

2264
01:31:48.94 --> 01:31:51.38
And a three month period, you know,

2265
01:31:51.38 --> 01:31:54.06
they're really not any tougher

2266
01:31:54.06 --> 01:31:57.34
than they were three months before when they got there.

2267
01:31:57.34 --> 01:32:01.34
But their mindset is different.

2268
01:32:01.34 --> 01:32:03.74
I would say that that's probably the biggest thing.

2269
01:32:03.74 --> 01:32:05.26
We just, we changed their mindset.

2270
01:32:05.26 --> 01:32:08.78
And hopefully we're making a better product for America.

2271
01:32:09.78 --> 01:32:11.98
When the kids go back home, if they get out,

2272
01:32:11.98 --> 01:32:14.66
hopefully we're putting a better product back

2273
01:32:14.66 --> 01:32:17.14
into society after serving in the Marines.

2274
01:32:17.14 --> 01:32:19.06
And, you know, I would say the majority,

2275
01:32:19.06 --> 01:32:20.30
we're doing a pretty good job.

2276
01:32:20.30 --> 01:32:23.18
But I would say that for pretty much all the armed services.

2277
01:32:24.22 --> 01:32:27.38
The instant obedience to orders,

2278
01:32:27.38 --> 01:32:32.38
when do you get the, in the Marine Corps,

2279
01:32:32.46 --> 01:32:34.02
you know, Marine Corps was like,

2280
01:32:34.02 --> 01:32:36.30
we already talked about all gray and the enlightenment,

2281
01:32:36.30 --> 01:32:38.06
the second enlightenment of the Marine Corps,

2282
01:32:38.06 --> 01:32:39.58
which is, hey, we want people to think,

2283
01:32:39.58 --> 01:32:42.50
we want to have, you know, mission type orders

2284
01:32:42.50 --> 01:32:43.66
and those kind of things.

2285
01:32:43.66 --> 01:32:46.66
At what point do you go from, all right,

2286
01:32:46.66 --> 01:32:48.26
I'm a robot, I'm going to obey the orders

2287
01:32:48.26 --> 01:32:50.54
that are given to me to hold on a second boss.

2288
01:32:50.54 --> 01:32:51.98
Here's what my thoughts are.

2289
01:32:51.98 --> 01:32:53.10
Yeah, usually when you're getting

2290
01:32:53.10 --> 01:32:54.38
the non-commissioned officer,

2291
01:32:54.38 --> 01:32:57.38
when you step into that team leader role, you know what I mean?

2292
01:32:57.38 --> 01:32:59.78
And then you're, you know, you're reading assignment.

2293
01:32:59.78 --> 01:33:03.10
Usually, I don't know if it's still to this day,

2294
01:33:03.10 --> 01:33:06.66
but you know, reading message to Garcia, you know what I mean?

2295
01:33:06.66 --> 01:33:09.06
Just getting them on those little interests

2296
01:33:09.06 --> 01:33:12.82
of starting to thank on their own, you know what I mean?

2297
01:33:12.82 --> 01:33:14.98
And not necessarily like everything

2298
01:33:14.98 --> 01:33:19.98
has to come from a book, like everything very set in stone.

2299
01:33:20.06 --> 01:33:20.90
You know what I mean?

2300
01:33:20.90 --> 01:33:23.62
So when Al Gray, you know, brings in these, you know,

2301
01:33:23.62 --> 01:33:27.34
the war fighting publications, yeah, it's starting to,

2302
01:33:27.34 --> 01:33:31.86
it's kind of liberating that you can,

2303
01:33:31.86 --> 01:33:35.46
now there's not a problem with like questioning authority.

2304
01:33:35.46 --> 01:33:37.86
It's basically, you're not really, you're just asking why,

2305
01:33:37.86 --> 01:33:39.70
like what's the why in it?

2306
01:33:39.70 --> 01:33:41.50
Like why are we here?

2307
01:33:41.50 --> 01:33:43.94
Why are we doing it this way?

2308
01:33:43.94 --> 01:33:45.90
Is it just because you're telling me to,

2309
01:33:45.90 --> 01:33:46.74
you know what I mean?

2310
01:33:46.74 --> 01:33:50.30
Or is there actually some, you know, method to the madness?

2311
01:33:51.34 --> 01:33:52.30
So I would say, you know,

2312
01:33:52.30 --> 01:33:55.62
once you get into that team leader kind of role and NCO,

2313
01:33:55.62 --> 01:33:58.06
you know, the non-commissioned officer, you know,

2314
01:33:58.06 --> 01:33:59.86
that's when, you know, we're gonna start,

2315
01:33:59.86 --> 01:34:01.86
you need to start thinking on your own.

2316
01:34:01.86 --> 01:34:03.30
You need to start taking charge.

2317
01:34:03.30 --> 01:34:05.62
It's not that instant obedience to orders.

2318
01:34:05.62 --> 01:34:08.74
And, you know, if you see something that's not right,

2319
01:34:08.74 --> 01:34:10.50
then, you know, bring that up.

2320
01:34:10.50 --> 01:34:13.38
And you shouldn't be worried about the repercussions

2321
01:34:13.38 --> 01:34:14.66
of questioning.

2322
01:34:15.54 --> 01:34:18.90
You know, now there are some that don't like to be questioned.

2323
01:34:18.90 --> 01:34:22.30
So of course, you know, there's that aspect of it,

2324
01:34:22.30 --> 01:34:24.10
but that's in any organization.

2325
01:34:24.10 --> 01:34:27.30
Any organization has those kind of jerks.

2326
01:34:27.30 --> 01:34:31.38
So you get done with, what happens when you get done

2327
01:34:31.38 --> 01:34:32.54
with your time at drill instructor school?

2328
01:34:32.54 --> 01:34:33.58
You go back to one sex?

2329
01:34:33.58 --> 01:34:35.06
Yep, go right back.

2330
01:34:35.06 --> 01:34:37.34
First, it didn't want to have to buy new t-shirts and stuff.

2331
01:34:37.34 --> 01:34:39.42
So I figured, hey man, yeah, I call the monitor.

2332
01:34:39.42 --> 01:34:42.18
Let's go right back to 1st Battalion 6 Marines.

2333
01:34:42.18 --> 01:34:44.54
Went back there.

2334
01:34:44.54 --> 01:34:48.18
And now I'm stepping into that like platoon sergeant

2335
01:34:48.18 --> 01:34:53.18
kind of thing, the Eli Tucker of my career.

2336
01:34:54.50 --> 01:34:55.34
And that-

2337
01:34:55.34 --> 01:34:57.86
You mentioned to me one time we were talking

2338
01:34:57.86 --> 01:35:00.18
and you were like, oh, some guys had a hard time

2339
01:35:00.18 --> 01:35:03.82
taking off their DI hat, meaning they come from

2340
01:35:03.82 --> 01:35:05.86
the drill field where they're yelling and screaming

2341
01:35:05.86 --> 01:35:09.02
and expect to be treated basically like a god.

2342
01:35:09.02 --> 01:35:11.86
And now they're back in a platoon and it's like,

2343
01:35:11.86 --> 01:35:14.62
they keep acting like that and it can be a problem.

2344
01:35:14.62 --> 01:35:18.58
Yeah, I mean, now I don't want the fellow drill instructors

2345
01:35:18.58 --> 01:35:21.38
out there to take offense, but the Marine drill instructor

2346
01:35:21.38 --> 01:35:24.02
is you're just the lowest paid actor.

2347
01:35:24.02 --> 01:35:27.02
I mean, it is an acting job.

2348
01:35:27.02 --> 01:35:32.02
I mean, you're putting on a, it's a show.

2349
01:35:32.22 --> 01:35:34.70
And some of them be like, oh, they don't agree with that.

2350
01:35:34.70 --> 01:35:38.06
Well, if I'm like the third hat, I have a certain way

2351
01:35:38.06 --> 01:35:39.58
that they want me to act as a third hat.

2352
01:35:39.58 --> 01:35:42.06
If I'm the heavy, you know what I mean?

2353
01:35:42.06 --> 01:35:45.30
The second hat, the J of what they call third hat.

2354
01:35:45.30 --> 01:35:47.06
The third hat, you're like Nick the new hat.

2355
01:35:47.06 --> 01:35:48.54
You just graduated from school.

2356
01:35:48.54 --> 01:35:50.62
Literally, you might as well just get a laundry number

2357
01:35:50.62 --> 01:35:51.58
and stay with the recruits

2358
01:35:51.58 --> 01:35:53.42
because you don't know what you're doing.

2359
01:35:53.42 --> 01:35:54.26
You know what I mean?

2360
01:35:54.26 --> 01:35:56.70
So you just run around and they're like, hey,

2361
01:35:56.70 --> 01:35:59.14
they'd be like, hey dog, you need to get louder

2362
01:35:59.14 --> 01:36:00.82
and you need to get faster.

2363
01:36:00.82 --> 01:36:03.06
Yeah, everything that you're doing is not fast enough.

2364
01:36:03.06 --> 01:36:04.14
It's not loud enough.

2365
01:36:04.14 --> 01:36:05.10
It's not, you know what I mean?

2366
01:36:05.10 --> 01:36:08.94
So you're running around and you're trying to be that,

2367
01:36:08.94 --> 01:36:10.74
that sand flee the word,

2368
01:36:10.74 --> 01:36:13.74
you're just never letting these kids get a break.

2369
01:36:14.70 --> 01:36:19.70
The heavy like the, he's the senior green belt in the platoon

2370
01:36:20.98 --> 01:36:23.42
and he's teaching them everything drill,

2371
01:36:23.42 --> 01:36:25.18
teaching them squad bay procedures.

2372
01:36:25.18 --> 01:36:26.02
You know what I mean?

2373
01:36:26.02 --> 01:36:26.86
He's very firm.

2374
01:36:26.86 --> 01:36:29.10
Like the heavies, the guy that's the most experienced

2375
01:36:29.10 --> 01:36:31.38
drill instructor, he's the one as a recruit

2376
01:36:31.38 --> 01:36:32.94
you don't mess with.

2377
01:36:32.94 --> 01:36:35.26
This guy, he knows the drill.

2378
01:36:35.26 --> 01:36:37.30
He's very good at his job.

2379
01:36:37.30 --> 01:36:39.06
And then you got like the senior drill instructor

2380
01:36:39.06 --> 01:36:40.34
that wears the black belt.

2381
01:36:40.34 --> 01:36:41.86
He's like dad.

2382
01:36:41.86 --> 01:36:42.70
You know what I mean?

2383
01:36:42.70 --> 01:36:46.74
Like he comes in, he hands out mail, he's nicer to you.

2384
01:36:46.74 --> 01:36:49.38
And these are all stated roles?

2385
01:36:49.38 --> 01:36:52.90
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, if you're like the third hat,

2386
01:36:52.90 --> 01:36:55.62
like the new guy and you're in there like big daddy

2387
01:36:55.62 --> 01:36:57.82
and the recruits and handing out candy to them.

2388
01:36:57.82 --> 01:37:00.70
Yeah, you're not gonna go over well with your peers.

2389
01:37:00.70 --> 01:37:01.54
You know what I mean?

2390
01:37:01.54 --> 01:37:03.98
They're gonna, you know, it's that peer pressure

2391
01:37:03.98 --> 01:37:08.98
of how you're kind of of what role you play in the platoon.

2392
01:37:09.90 --> 01:37:13.22
So, you know, some of the folks when you leave the drill field

2393
01:37:13.22 --> 01:37:15.66
and you go back to the fleet Marine force,

2394
01:37:15.66 --> 01:37:19.10
some of the folks, they like, they wear that smokey.

2395
01:37:19.10 --> 01:37:22.02
They wanna, they wanna wear it in the fleet.

2396
01:37:22.02 --> 01:37:25.50
And a lot of folks are like, look dude,

2397
01:37:25.50 --> 01:37:28.14
we're not in boot camp anymore.

2398
01:37:28.14 --> 01:37:29.26
And you know what I mean?

2399
01:37:29.26 --> 01:37:31.78
You need to leave that hat on the island.

2400
01:37:31.78 --> 01:37:36.46
But, you know, when you do come back and, you know,

2401
01:37:36.46 --> 01:37:39.58
especially with the officers and the senior enlisted

2402
01:37:39.58 --> 01:37:42.34
as a drill instructor, you know what I mean?

2403
01:37:42.34 --> 01:37:43.46
I mean, you're bringing,

2404
01:37:45.62 --> 01:37:48.94
you're bringing a lot of experience, you know what I mean?

2405
01:37:48.94 --> 01:37:51.78
And work ethic back to the battalion.

2406
01:37:51.78 --> 01:37:54.82
You know, my oldest daughter, she's married to a Marine.

2407
01:37:54.82 --> 01:37:56.18
He's infantry.

2408
01:37:56.18 --> 01:37:59.62
He just finished his, he was a DI.

2409
01:37:59.62 --> 01:38:01.50
You know, of course he calls me, what should I do next?

2410
01:38:01.50 --> 01:38:02.54
Drone instructor, man.

2411
01:38:02.54 --> 01:38:03.38
You know what I mean?

2412
01:38:03.38 --> 01:38:04.70
And he knocked it out the park

2413
01:38:04.70 --> 01:38:06.74
and now he's back at Camp Lejeune.

2414
01:38:06.74 --> 01:38:08.38
And that's the first thing I told him,

2415
01:38:08.38 --> 01:38:11.78
leave the, leave the smokey, you know, at Parris Island.

2416
01:38:11.78 --> 01:38:12.62
You know what I mean?

2417
01:38:12.62 --> 01:38:13.44
There's just no place for it.

2418
01:38:13.44 --> 01:38:16.34
That's not a, that's not a leadership style.

2419
01:38:17.62 --> 01:38:21.86
You know, nobody really responds well to that.

2420
01:38:21.86 --> 01:38:25.82
Other than Marine Corps recruits in, you know,

2421
01:38:25.82 --> 01:38:26.86
at Parris Island.

2422
01:38:26.86 --> 01:38:27.70
Right.

2423
01:38:27.70 --> 01:38:28.54
That's it.

2424
01:38:28.54 --> 01:38:29.38
That's it.

2425
01:38:29.38 --> 01:38:31.70
But then the funny thing is, is like, you know,

2426
01:38:31.70 --> 01:38:33.22
after you've been on the drill field,

2427
01:38:33.22 --> 01:38:36.70
you can't really remember all the recruits that you've had,

2428
01:38:36.70 --> 01:38:38.26
just cause there's just a whole bunch of them.

2429
01:38:38.26 --> 01:38:40.70
So it's kind of hard to like keep up.

2430
01:38:40.70 --> 01:38:43.62
But some of them, you end up like finding out that,

2431
01:38:43.62 --> 01:38:47.02
like that kid was in your platoon and you go over to him

2432
01:38:47.02 --> 01:38:48.26
and it's like, hey, my heck of me didn't come over

2433
01:38:48.26 --> 01:38:49.10
and say anything.

2434
01:38:49.10 --> 01:38:49.94
You're on platoon.

2435
01:38:49.94 --> 01:38:52.18
They're like, I wasn't going to come over and talk to you.

2436
01:38:52.18 --> 01:38:54.02
Man, like are you shitting me?

2437
01:38:54.02 --> 01:38:55.38
Like dude, I'm scared to death at you.

2438
01:38:55.38 --> 01:38:57.74
And it's just like, just a regular guy.

2439
01:38:57.74 --> 01:38:58.58
You know what I mean?

2440
01:38:58.58 --> 01:39:00.94
That whole perception and, you know,

2441
01:39:00.94 --> 01:39:04.94
everybody still remembers their Marine drill instructors.

2442
01:39:04.94 --> 01:39:07.50
It's even me, my Sergeant Williams

2443
01:39:07.50 --> 01:39:08.50
was my senior drill instructor.

2444
01:39:08.50 --> 01:39:10.10
I'll never forget that guy.

2445
01:39:10.10 --> 01:39:10.94
Yeah.

2446
01:39:10.94 --> 01:39:11.78
And he was motor T.

2447
01:39:11.78 --> 01:39:14.26
Oddly enough, my drill instructor,

2448
01:39:14.26 --> 01:39:16.78
I still remember in officer candidate school

2449
01:39:16.78 --> 01:39:20.38
and his last name, his gunnery Sergeant Seals,

2450
01:39:20.38 --> 01:39:22.70
which is an interesting coincidence, right?

2451
01:39:22.70 --> 01:39:23.54
Yeah.

2452
01:39:23.54 --> 01:39:24.90
Awesome guy.

2453
01:39:24.90 --> 01:39:25.94
Awesome guy.

2454
01:39:25.94 --> 01:39:28.06
So you get back to one six and now you're,

2455
01:39:28.06 --> 01:39:29.34
now you're a platoon Sergeant.

2456
01:39:29.34 --> 01:39:30.18
Is that right?

2457
01:39:30.18 --> 01:39:31.02
Yeah.

2458
01:39:31.02 --> 01:39:31.86
Yeah.

2459
01:39:31.86 --> 01:39:32.70
I'm back.

2460
01:39:32.70 --> 01:39:33.54
I was still a Sergeant.

2461
01:39:33.54 --> 01:39:34.38
So I was at E five.

2462
01:39:34.38 --> 01:39:38.06
Technically you're supposed to be a E six to get a platoon,

2463
01:39:38.06 --> 01:39:40.70
but you know, they were, they were short on those guys.

2464
01:39:40.70 --> 01:39:42.90
So I got a platoon.

2465
01:39:42.90 --> 01:39:45.74
And this is what like 1997 or something like that?

2466
01:39:45.74 --> 01:39:46.58
96.

2467
01:39:46.58 --> 01:39:47.42
Yeah.

2468
01:39:47.42 --> 01:39:48.26
I finished, yeah.

2469
01:39:48.26 --> 01:39:49.98
I finished on the drill field in 95

2470
01:39:49.98 --> 01:39:56.98
and came over and right back into one six and 96.

2471
01:39:56.98 --> 01:40:01.98
And I was very excited to be back at canvashing.

2472
01:40:03.70 --> 01:40:06.66
Not that I didn't have a, like a good time at,

2473
01:40:06.66 --> 01:40:07.50
at Pereson.

2474
01:40:07.50 --> 01:40:09.78
I had a little bit, you know, as a D I had a little run in

2475
01:40:09.78 --> 01:40:12.58
with a, with one of the battalion commanders that was down there.

2476
01:40:12.58 --> 01:40:15.74
And he thought it was a little overly aggressive.

2477
01:40:15.74 --> 01:40:18.90
And, you know, it was, you know,

2478
01:40:18.90 --> 01:40:21.66
he told me, you know, let me tell you what it's like to be a

2479
01:40:21.66 --> 01:40:22.50
drill instructor.

2480
01:40:22.50 --> 01:40:26.02
And I was like, when were you a drill instructor, sir?

2481
01:40:26.02 --> 01:40:27.78
That went over like a fart in church.

2482
01:40:27.78 --> 01:40:28.62
You know what I mean?

2483
01:40:28.62 --> 01:40:30.10
He didn't like that aspect of it.

2484
01:40:30.10 --> 01:40:33.78
And so me and him didn't necessarily see eye to eye.

2485
01:40:33.78 --> 01:40:36.94
So when I left Peres Island, they were like, you know,

2486
01:40:36.94 --> 01:40:38.58
please don't come back.

2487
01:40:38.58 --> 01:40:40.42
But it was a lot of fun.

2488
01:40:40.42 --> 01:40:42.38
And then when I got back to the fleet,

2489
01:40:43.94 --> 01:40:45.94
there was a lot of other guys that, you know,

2490
01:40:45.94 --> 01:40:48.78
the drill instructor community is, is very small.

2491
01:40:48.78 --> 01:40:50.06
And it's pretty tight.

2492
01:40:50.98 --> 01:40:54.46
And if, and if you get back in, one of the company gunnies,

2493
01:40:54.46 --> 01:40:55.86
his name was Clifford Happy.

2494
01:40:55.86 --> 01:40:57.62
He was a hat.

2495
01:40:57.62 --> 01:41:01.10
So when I came in, you know, I just got more opportunities

2496
01:41:01.10 --> 01:41:03.58
just because I had that experience of being a drill

2497
01:41:03.58 --> 01:41:04.62
instructor.

2498
01:41:04.62 --> 01:41:08.74
So they gave me a platoon, which I was super stoked with.

2499
01:41:08.74 --> 01:41:11.26
And they gave me a platoon commander.

2500
01:41:11.26 --> 01:41:13.06
His name Buck Rollins.

2501
01:41:13.06 --> 01:41:16.62
Dad was Wayne Rollins, two star general,

2502
01:41:16.62 --> 01:41:19.02
Navy Cross, Warner Vietnam.

2503
01:41:19.02 --> 01:41:21.82
Great guy, I've just attended his funeral a few months back.

2504
01:41:21.82 --> 01:41:23.86
He was buried in Arlington.

2505
01:41:23.86 --> 01:41:26.70
Buck Rollins and I, you know, somebody there,

2506
01:41:26.70 --> 01:41:29.30
Doug Zembeck was there at the time.

2507
01:41:29.30 --> 01:41:31.50
I mean, that battalion for some odd reason, man,

2508
01:41:31.50 --> 01:41:35.50
we had some like amazing second lieutenants

2509
01:41:35.50 --> 01:41:39.78
like that were just like, you didn't really see

2510
01:41:39.78 --> 01:41:44.30
that many great guys that were all in that battalion

2511
01:41:44.30 --> 01:41:49.30
from Pascoley to, you know, there was just a bunch of them.

2512
01:41:49.42 --> 01:41:52.98
Freighto was in there, was platoon commanders.

2513
01:41:52.98 --> 01:41:55.22
That was my first experience of where, you know,

2514
01:41:55.22 --> 01:41:57.62
when you become up as a platoon sergeant,

2515
01:41:57.62 --> 01:42:00.46
you get to spend more time with platoon commanders.

2516
01:42:00.46 --> 01:42:01.98
You know, before that, you don't really hang out

2517
01:42:01.98 --> 01:42:05.34
with the officers like at all, you know what I mean?

2518
01:42:05.34 --> 01:42:08.22
But then you become like, you know, you're a partner.

2519
01:42:08.22 --> 01:42:09.06
You know what I mean?

2520
01:42:09.06 --> 01:42:11.78
You're gonna work this platoon together.

2521
01:42:11.78 --> 01:42:14.50
And I had, you know, I was very fortunate

2522
01:42:14.50 --> 01:42:18.78
I had Buck Rollins, I had Doug Zembeck, and I had Doug Olson.

2523
01:42:18.78 --> 01:42:21.38
These guys were your platoon commanders?

2524
01:42:21.38 --> 01:42:24.02
Yeah, and I worked with them.

2525
01:42:24.90 --> 01:42:27.58
They were the platoon commander, but it's my platoon.

2526
01:42:28.90 --> 01:42:29.74
Yeah.

2527
01:42:29.74 --> 01:42:30.82
Yeah, they just get to hang out.

2528
01:42:30.82 --> 01:42:31.66
Yeah.

2529
01:42:31.66 --> 01:42:34.06
They're, they say in the officers,

2530
01:42:34.06 --> 01:42:35.58
about the officers and the SEAL teams is like,

2531
01:42:35.58 --> 01:42:37.78
they rent, we own.

2532
01:42:37.78 --> 01:42:38.86
Yeah.

2533
01:42:38.86 --> 01:42:40.22
The officers rent, we own.

2534
01:42:40.22 --> 01:42:43.46
It's like the chief, you know, the e-dogs,

2535
01:42:43.46 --> 01:42:44.78
it's their platoon.

2536
01:42:44.78 --> 01:42:46.22
The officers just, you know, he's gonna be here

2537
01:42:46.22 --> 01:42:48.30
for a little while, but this is our platoon.

2538
01:42:48.30 --> 01:42:50.70
Yeah, that's pretty much the exact same thing it is

2539
01:42:50.70 --> 01:42:51.94
in an infrashoot battalion.

2540
01:42:51.94 --> 01:42:53.58
It's the platoon sergeant.

2541
01:42:53.58 --> 01:42:55.22
It's, you know, like I said, I mean, you know,

2542
01:42:55.22 --> 01:42:58.62
Eli Tucker had a huge effect on me as a platoon sergeant

2543
01:42:58.62 --> 01:43:00.86
and, you know, coming in from the kids

2544
01:43:00.86 --> 01:43:02.46
that were in that platoon.

2545
01:43:02.46 --> 01:43:07.46
And I've stayed in 1-6 for like three and a half years

2546
01:43:07.70 --> 01:43:09.54
in the battalion, did a couple of pumps.

2547
01:43:09.54 --> 01:43:13.34
I was gonna say, so you do a workup, training cycle,

2548
01:43:13.34 --> 01:43:14.70
and then go on deployment.

2549
01:43:14.70 --> 01:43:17.74
Were you riding ships on those deployments?

2550
01:43:17.74 --> 01:43:20.54
Yeah, riding ships, doing the workup.

2551
01:43:20.54 --> 01:43:24.86
We did a med float, which was, which was super cool.

2552
01:43:24.86 --> 01:43:25.94
We kind of got deployed early.

2553
01:43:25.94 --> 01:43:28.66
I ended up over in Albania, Toronto, Albania,

2554
01:43:28.66 --> 01:43:30.50
if you remember in like the 97 timeframe,

2555
01:43:30.50 --> 01:43:33.34
they were kind of blowing embassies up around the,

2556
01:43:33.34 --> 01:43:34.46
so we got the call.

2557
01:43:34.46 --> 01:43:37.94
I was with the 24th, yeah, 24th Mu.

2558
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:41.70
And we would just finished up doing workup.

2559
01:43:41.70 --> 01:43:45.70
And we needed to, they wanted us to go into Toronto, Albania.

2560
01:43:45.70 --> 01:43:47.10
So, you know, I got the call.

2561
01:43:47.10 --> 01:43:50.10
At that time I had the sniper platoon.

2562
01:43:50.10 --> 01:43:54.58
So I had the snipers, I took 12 guys.

2563
01:43:54.58 --> 01:43:59.18
And, you know, we jumped on C-130s up in Cherry Point

2564
01:43:59.18 --> 01:44:01.66
with an infantry rifle company.

2565
01:44:01.66 --> 01:44:03.38
And they flew us over.

2566
01:44:03.38 --> 01:44:05.06
We did a refuel.

2567
01:44:05.06 --> 01:44:07.38
I think it's Singapore, landed in Italy,

2568
01:44:07.38 --> 01:44:10.66
got on a 53, flew out on a USS Ipan.

2569
01:44:10.66 --> 01:44:12.54
With the 22nd Mu, got briefed in,

2570
01:44:12.54 --> 01:44:15.46
and we were in country in Toronto, Albania

2571
01:44:15.46 --> 01:44:19.06
after they had evacuated the embassies out of there.

2572
01:44:19.06 --> 01:44:22.74
And that was, we stayed over there for a couple of months.

2573
01:44:22.74 --> 01:44:23.58
And so what were you doing?

2574
01:44:23.58 --> 01:44:24.54
What was your mission?

2575
01:44:24.54 --> 01:44:29.54
Just basically running, the embassy was evacuated.

2576
01:44:30.94 --> 01:44:31.78
So we were-

2577
01:44:31.78 --> 01:44:32.62
So it's empty?

2578
01:44:32.62 --> 01:44:33.46
Yeah, it's empty.

2579
01:44:33.46 --> 01:44:34.30
I mean-

2580
01:44:34.30 --> 01:44:35.90
And so you guys are basically doing security on the embassy?

2581
01:44:35.90 --> 01:44:36.74
Yep.

2582
01:44:36.74 --> 01:44:37.82
You mean get trashed or whatever?

2583
01:44:37.82 --> 01:44:39.58
Or no one comes in and steals shit?

2584
01:44:39.58 --> 01:44:40.50
Yep.

2585
01:44:40.50 --> 01:44:44.10
And I mean, it had a lot of other agencies

2586
01:44:44.10 --> 01:44:46.06
that were over there running around.

2587
01:44:47.42 --> 01:44:50.50
There was some Navy SEALs were over there.

2588
01:44:50.50 --> 01:44:52.14
There was a lot of stuff going on.

2589
01:44:52.14 --> 01:44:52.98
You know what I mean?

2590
01:44:52.98 --> 01:44:54.54
The overarching was Bosnia.

2591
01:44:54.54 --> 01:44:55.38
You know what I mean?

2592
01:44:55.38 --> 01:44:57.34
That whole region at the time.

2593
01:44:57.34 --> 01:44:59.94
It was a really good experience.

2594
01:44:59.94 --> 01:45:01.34
You know, especially for the younger guys

2595
01:45:01.34 --> 01:45:02.46
that were in the platoon,

2596
01:45:02.46 --> 01:45:05.18
the guys that I had in that platoon,

2597
01:45:05.18 --> 01:45:08.34
even still this day, I'm still in contact with.

2598
01:45:09.50 --> 01:45:11.70
You know, from those guys,

2599
01:45:11.70 --> 01:45:14.38
that was a very special time.

2600
01:45:14.38 --> 01:45:16.42
Those three years at 1.6,

2601
01:45:16.42 --> 01:45:19.06
being a platoon sergeant or what you would call

2602
01:45:19.06 --> 01:45:23.10
like chief scout kind of role was just huge.

2603
01:45:23.10 --> 01:45:27.06
I learned more about myself then, you know,

2604
01:45:27.06 --> 01:45:29.70
with those folks and just, you know,

2605
01:45:29.70 --> 01:45:32.42
they're relying on me, you know what I mean?

2606
01:45:32.42 --> 01:45:35.62
To train, educate them, take care of them.

2607
01:45:36.46 --> 01:45:40.50
It was a really special time in a Marine Corps

2608
01:45:40.50 --> 01:45:42.82
for that time in service.

2609
01:45:42.82 --> 01:45:45.90
When you went over there, were you the senior guy

2610
01:45:45.90 --> 01:45:47.22
or did you have an officer?

2611
01:45:47.22 --> 01:45:49.34
We had an officer, company commander.

2612
01:45:49.34 --> 01:45:50.74
Company commander, we had a,

2613
01:45:50.74 --> 01:45:54.98
and then of course the Mew had some of their Mew staff

2614
01:45:54.98 --> 01:45:56.30
that was over there.

2615
01:45:56.30 --> 01:45:58.90
Sean Pascoley was a captain that was over there.

2616
01:45:58.90 --> 01:46:03.90
I'm still friends with Sean.

2617
01:46:03.90 --> 01:46:06.58
Those guys, they had a company kind of reinforced.

2618
01:46:06.58 --> 01:46:08.18
So we had some guys that were at the embassy,

2619
01:46:08.18 --> 01:46:10.14
we had some guys that kind of stayed back

2620
01:46:10.14 --> 01:46:12.22
and they were at the housing complex.

2621
01:46:12.22 --> 01:46:13.82
You still had State Department folks

2622
01:46:13.82 --> 01:46:16.54
that were milling about the area

2623
01:46:16.54 --> 01:46:19.30
and you know, they're just looking for bad guys.

2624
01:46:19.30 --> 01:46:21.14
We did a lot of time like watching.

2625
01:46:21.14 --> 01:46:24.58
We were basically the snipers, we were overwatch.

2626
01:46:24.58 --> 01:46:26.98
So you know, we had Albanians working gates,

2627
01:46:26.98 --> 01:46:29.26
stuff like that, you know, we would hire them

2628
01:46:29.26 --> 01:46:31.86
and then we would do the overwatch for them.

2629
01:46:31.86 --> 01:46:33.50
Over at the embassy, it was right next

2630
01:46:33.50 --> 01:46:35.50
to the University of Toronto.

2631
01:46:35.50 --> 01:46:37.66
So it was just a lot of observing,

2632
01:46:37.66 --> 01:46:39.34
a lot of time observing,

2633
01:46:39.34 --> 01:46:42.26
but it was the same experience for those guys

2634
01:46:42.26 --> 01:46:44.62
that I got when I was in went to Panama.

2635
01:46:44.62 --> 01:46:46.66
You know, when they issue out the live ammo,

2636
01:46:46.66 --> 01:46:48.34
it's just a different game.

2637
01:46:48.34 --> 01:46:51.30
You know, even though nothing eventful,

2638
01:46:51.30 --> 01:46:55.06
which I'm thankful for, took place while we were over there.

2639
01:46:55.06 --> 01:46:57.06
Because you know, the only thing that would come in

2640
01:46:57.06 --> 01:46:58.94
in the back of my mind, when I think of like being

2641
01:46:58.94 --> 01:47:00.70
at an embassy is Beirut.

2642
01:47:01.58 --> 01:47:04.22
You know, when you're just blowing stuff up,

2643
01:47:04.22 --> 01:47:06.78
that's not necessarily warfare anymore.

2644
01:47:06.78 --> 01:47:09.34
You know, that's terrorist activities.

2645
01:47:09.34 --> 01:47:11.14
That's a, you know, and you know,

2646
01:47:11.14 --> 01:47:15.46
when you think of the events of an infantry company,

2647
01:47:15.46 --> 01:47:17.42
you know, in a barracks, you know,

2648
01:47:17.42 --> 01:47:20.14
you can't help but think of Beirut.

2649
01:47:20.14 --> 01:47:22.38
So, but luckily we learned from that.

2650
01:47:22.38 --> 01:47:23.74
The company commander was there,

2651
01:47:23.74 --> 01:47:25.50
like we were very well dispersed.

2652
01:47:25.50 --> 01:47:29.18
Nobody was gonna be in one, you know, single point of failure.

2653
01:47:29.18 --> 01:47:31.42
The overwatch on the gates, the guards.

2654
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:33.22
I mean, it was, there wasn't, you know,

2655
01:47:33.22 --> 01:47:34.58
the rules of engagement, you know,

2656
01:47:34.58 --> 01:47:37.58
of what they had to deal with at Beirut,

2657
01:47:37.58 --> 01:47:38.54
completely different.

2658
01:47:38.54 --> 01:47:41.74
So obviously, you know, we were a learning organization

2659
01:47:41.74 --> 01:47:43.98
of we're not gonna let this kind of happen again,

2660
01:47:43.98 --> 01:47:46.62
which was really cool for those guys

2661
01:47:46.62 --> 01:47:48.94
to kind of go through that experience.

2662
01:47:48.94 --> 01:47:50.86
And then, you know, once everything was over,

2663
01:47:50.86 --> 01:47:54.46
and the threats were pretty much eliminated and gone,

2664
01:47:54.46 --> 01:47:56.98
they brought the embassy back and ambassador comes back in.

2665
01:47:56.98 --> 01:48:00.22
And I mean, people go to Toronto, Albania on vacation.

2666
01:48:00.22 --> 01:48:03.58
I mean, which is kind of funny.

2667
01:48:03.58 --> 01:48:06.34
You know, even like, you know, people go to Panama now.

2668
01:48:06.34 --> 01:48:08.38
It's a great vacation spot.

2669
01:48:09.18 --> 01:48:10.90
You know, when I was there, I never thought that like,

2670
01:48:10.90 --> 01:48:13.18
who would want to come to Toronto, Albania?

2671
01:48:13.18 --> 01:48:14.02
You know what I mean?

2672
01:48:14.02 --> 01:48:17.06
But they were super nice people, you know,

2673
01:48:17.06 --> 01:48:18.30
beautiful part of the world,

2674
01:48:18.30 --> 01:48:20.94
but just different than us.

2675
01:48:20.94 --> 01:48:23.18
Then what came after that?

2676
01:48:23.18 --> 01:48:27.62
After that, I got, when I attended, up at Quantico,

2677
01:48:27.62 --> 01:48:28.78
I attended the advanced,

2678
01:48:28.78 --> 01:48:31.78
they used to have an advanced sniper school up at Quantico.

2679
01:48:31.78 --> 01:48:33.34
So I went through the advanced sniper school

2680
01:48:33.34 --> 01:48:35.22
prior to that deployment.

2681
01:48:35.22 --> 01:48:38.58
And the staff in CIC that was up there,

2682
01:48:38.58 --> 01:48:41.74
Bill Norton, his name, we call him Max.

2683
01:48:41.74 --> 01:48:44.06
Max is, he asked me if I wanted to come back up

2684
01:48:44.06 --> 01:48:46.42
to be an instructor at Quantico

2685
01:48:46.42 --> 01:48:48.14
after that next deployment.

2686
01:48:48.14 --> 01:48:50.86
And of course, yeah, I was like, yeah.

2687
01:48:51.98 --> 01:48:54.74
You know, I mean, going up to Quantico,

2688
01:48:54.74 --> 01:48:56.46
so he brought me up there as an instructor

2689
01:48:56.46 --> 01:48:57.30
when I got done.

2690
01:48:57.30 --> 01:48:59.02
So I was an instructor at Quantico.

2691
01:48:59.02 --> 01:49:00.82
I took over as the chief instructor

2692
01:49:01.74 --> 01:49:04.18
for the school house up at Quantico, which was, I mean,

2693
01:49:04.18 --> 01:49:07.46
it was tons of fun.

2694
01:49:07.46 --> 01:49:10.86
Just, I mean, you know, everybody that shows up,

2695
01:49:10.86 --> 01:49:11.70
I mean, sniper school,

2696
01:49:11.70 --> 01:49:14.82
because they do the, we do the basic course,

2697
01:49:14.82 --> 01:49:15.98
you do the advanced course,

2698
01:49:15.98 --> 01:49:18.46
and then you do what's called the sniper employment

2699
01:49:18.46 --> 01:49:19.34
officer course.

2700
01:49:19.34 --> 01:49:21.58
So the guys that are gonna be like in charge

2701
01:49:21.58 --> 01:49:23.42
of sniper platoons, we put them through a,

2702
01:49:23.42 --> 01:49:25.86
like a sniper employment package,

2703
01:49:25.86 --> 01:49:28.94
two week course kind of the thing at Quantico.

2704
01:49:28.94 --> 01:49:31.74
And I mean, it was just, it was a lot of fun.

2705
01:49:31.74 --> 01:49:35.50
Just every day, I mean, the instructors, the students,

2706
01:49:35.50 --> 01:49:37.14
it's just a lot of fun.

2707
01:49:37.14 --> 01:49:38.66
It's a great package.

2708
01:49:38.66 --> 01:49:39.50
You know what I mean?

2709
01:49:39.50 --> 01:49:42.10
The stocking exercises is like fun.

2710
01:49:42.10 --> 01:49:42.94
You know what I mean?

2711
01:49:42.94 --> 01:49:46.22
People should pay money to go do that.

2712
01:49:46.22 --> 01:49:48.82
And then just the, you know, bury your ass in brass.

2713
01:49:48.82 --> 01:49:51.54
I mean, you're gonna shoot a lot of ammo.

2714
01:49:52.54 --> 01:49:57.22
So, and as an instructor at that level,

2715
01:49:57.22 --> 01:49:58.42
you know, I was the chief instructor.

2716
01:49:58.42 --> 01:50:00.54
I expected that all the instructors on the cadre

2717
01:50:00.54 --> 01:50:02.94
should be able to perform any of the skill sets

2718
01:50:02.94 --> 01:50:06.18
at any given time, 365 days, you know,

2719
01:50:06.18 --> 01:50:09.42
when the kids would come in to run the physical fitness test,

2720
01:50:09.42 --> 01:50:11.62
I expected the instructors out there running

2721
01:50:11.62 --> 01:50:13.70
right along with the students.

2722
01:50:13.70 --> 01:50:15.94
You know, that kind of an aspect of, you know,

2723
01:50:15.94 --> 01:50:18.58
even though we've got mine, you know, a lot of times people,

2724
01:50:18.58 --> 01:50:21.58
you know, I got mine, let's make it harder for the next guy.

2725
01:50:21.58 --> 01:50:22.42
You know what I mean?

2726
01:50:22.42 --> 01:50:24.14
The training schedule alone is hard enough.

2727
01:50:24.14 --> 01:50:25.10
You don't have to.

2728
01:50:25.10 --> 01:50:28.02
How long is the, how long is the sniper course?

2729
01:50:28.02 --> 01:50:29.26
It's like 12 weeks.

2730
01:50:29.26 --> 01:50:30.90
Oh, it's a freaking no joke.

2731
01:50:30.90 --> 01:50:32.38
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know.

2732
01:50:32.38 --> 01:50:34.78
Is that the sniper course for the whole Marine Corps?

2733
01:50:34.78 --> 01:50:35.62
That's it.

2734
01:50:35.62 --> 01:50:36.90
Yeah, well, we've got Quantico,

2735
01:50:36.90 --> 01:50:38.66
and then you got Camp Lejeune, you got Pendleton.

2736
01:50:38.66 --> 01:50:39.66
So right up here at Pendleton,

2737
01:50:39.66 --> 01:50:41.94
they run the basic course four times a year.

2738
01:50:41.94 --> 01:50:43.10
And how long is the basic course?

2739
01:50:43.10 --> 01:50:44.06
It's the 12 week.

2740
01:50:44.06 --> 01:50:44.90
Okay.

2741
01:50:44.90 --> 01:50:47.30
And then they got rid of the advanced course.

2742
01:50:47.30 --> 01:50:49.02
Matter of fact, they got rid of the basic course.

2743
01:50:49.02 --> 01:50:51.50
Like it's all, and I'm sure it's better,

2744
01:50:51.50 --> 01:50:54.34
like better now than whatever we were doing.

2745
01:50:54.34 --> 01:50:57.74
You know, because we were still back in the,

2746
01:50:57.74 --> 01:51:00.82
probably in the half-cock days, you know what I mean,

2747
01:51:00.82 --> 01:51:04.98
of the white feather, you know, the Chuck Mulhaney,

2748
01:51:04.98 --> 01:51:08.74
you know, we're gonna, you know, the stocking and,

2749
01:51:08.74 --> 01:51:13.26
which stocking is a, I would say stocking is, it's patrolling.

2750
01:51:13.26 --> 01:51:14.94
It's just on the ground.

2751
01:51:14.94 --> 01:51:16.94
It's a different perspective.

2752
01:51:16.94 --> 01:51:20.10
You know, stocking, you learn so much

2753
01:51:20.10 --> 01:51:22.66
from just laying with your face,

2754
01:51:22.66 --> 01:51:25.46
sucking the earth of what we call skull dragon.

2755
01:51:25.46 --> 01:51:27.18
You might be the first person that I've heard say

2756
01:51:27.18 --> 01:51:28.54
stocking was fun.

2757
01:51:28.54 --> 01:51:31.26
Like most guys that go through the SEAL sniper course,

2758
01:51:31.26 --> 01:51:33.66
they're like, stocking is not fun.

2759
01:51:33.66 --> 01:51:38.18
I would say, because it's kind of, it's a game.

2760
01:51:38.18 --> 01:51:40.30
You know, you're going up against a guy

2761
01:51:40.30 --> 01:51:43.54
that's a trained observer and they're on glass.

2762
01:51:43.54 --> 01:51:46.06
And the ability for you to be able to come in to,

2763
01:51:46.06 --> 01:51:48.70
you know, 200 yards, you know what I mean,

2764
01:51:48.70 --> 01:51:52.30
get two rounds off undetected and stock out.

2765
01:51:52.30 --> 01:51:53.14
Yeah, it's amazing.

2766
01:51:53.14 --> 01:51:55.70
I mean, it's just, it's amazing of the ability

2767
01:51:55.70 --> 01:52:00.70
to hide, blend and deceive is pretty cool.

2768
01:52:00.70 --> 01:52:03.74
And if you understand how that all works,

2769
01:52:03.74 --> 01:52:05.38
I mean, you don't even need a ghillie suit.

2770
01:52:05.38 --> 01:52:08.86
You could be literally naked and stock.

2771
01:52:08.86 --> 01:52:11.90
If you understand how, you know,

2772
01:52:11.90 --> 01:52:14.98
this is the stocking of blending backdrop, you know,

2773
01:52:14.98 --> 01:52:16.02
the cover.

2774
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:17.98
So it was, it was a lot of fun.

2775
01:52:17.98 --> 01:52:21.02
Plus you just get a lot of really good Marines.

2776
01:52:21.02 --> 01:52:22.22
We used to get advanced course.

2777
01:52:22.22 --> 01:52:23.58
We'd have Navy SEALs come through.

2778
01:52:23.58 --> 01:52:26.42
We'd have Army Rangers come through up there.

2779
01:52:26.42 --> 01:52:27.50
British Royal Commando.

2780
01:52:27.50 --> 01:52:30.50
We actually have a British Royal on the staff at Quantico.

2781
01:52:30.50 --> 01:52:34.06
We have a really good relationship with the Brits.

2782
01:52:34.06 --> 01:52:36.06
So it's just a, you know, it's a fun time

2783
01:52:36.06 --> 01:52:38.70
when you've got like 24 great Americans

2784
01:52:38.70 --> 01:52:42.66
that just want to shoot bolt guns, you know what I mean?

2785
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:43.86
And look through glass.

2786
01:52:43.86 --> 01:52:46.22
It's just a fun time.

2787
01:52:46.22 --> 01:52:48.50
Everybody's there with a purpose.

2788
01:52:48.50 --> 01:52:49.74
Like there's not, you know,

2789
01:52:49.74 --> 01:52:51.70
the leadership aspect is kind of gone.

2790
01:52:51.70 --> 01:52:55.06
You don't necessarily, you lead by example, you know what I mean?

2791
01:52:55.06 --> 01:52:57.74
Like when I'm looking at an instructor, you know,

2792
01:52:57.74 --> 01:53:01.26
if I walk in on training day one and the instructor looks

2793
01:53:01.26 --> 01:53:03.46
like a seabag with lips and the first thing he's going to tell

2794
01:53:03.46 --> 01:53:06.54
me how he used to be a badass, you know what I mean?

2795
01:53:06.54 --> 01:53:08.38
Dude, you're 33 years old.

2796
01:53:08.38 --> 01:53:09.22
You know what I mean?

2797
01:53:09.22 --> 01:53:11.10
Like nobody's old here.

2798
01:53:11.10 --> 01:53:12.94
You know what I mean?

2799
01:53:12.94 --> 01:53:14.86
You know, but in that military, you think of,

2800
01:53:14.86 --> 01:53:16.26
man, that guy's an old man.

2801
01:53:16.26 --> 01:53:17.10
You know what I mean?

2802
01:53:17.10 --> 01:53:18.78
He's 34, brother.

2803
01:53:18.78 --> 01:53:19.62
You know what I mean?

2804
01:53:19.62 --> 01:53:23.54
Like you should be in the prime in your 30s.

2805
01:53:23.54 --> 01:53:27.22
So, you know, I always liked that about the snipers

2806
01:53:27.22 --> 01:53:30.02
and even the, the process school, it's up the road up here.

2807
01:53:30.02 --> 01:53:31.50
I'm sure it's the same with buds.

2808
01:53:31.50 --> 01:53:33.50
I mean, the instructors that are there, you know,

2809
01:53:33.50 --> 01:53:35.34
you just looking at them and I mean, they just,

2810
01:53:35.34 --> 01:53:36.54
they look the part.

2811
01:53:36.54 --> 01:53:37.38
They're better.

2812
01:53:37.38 --> 01:53:38.22
Yeah.

2813
01:53:38.22 --> 01:53:41.26
I mean, and they can do anything that they're asking

2814
01:53:41.26 --> 01:53:45.02
the student to do, which is, is a super cool way

2815
01:53:45.02 --> 01:53:47.98
of that, that leadership and then holding yourself accountable

2816
01:53:47.98 --> 01:53:52.66
to be, to being able to, to perform at any given time.

2817
01:53:52.66 --> 01:53:54.26
Yeah.

2818
01:53:54.26 --> 01:53:57.66
So where are you when September 11th happens?

2819
01:53:57.66 --> 01:53:58.50
Is this where you're at?

2820
01:53:58.50 --> 01:54:00.46
Is this where your station when September 11th happens?

2821
01:54:00.46 --> 01:54:01.30
Yep.

2822
01:54:01.30 --> 01:54:02.82
I'm up at Quantico.

2823
01:54:02.82 --> 01:54:06.18
That's why I call it, the world changed in nine miles.

2824
01:54:07.18 --> 01:54:08.66
We got the students off and I went,

2825
01:54:08.66 --> 01:54:12.54
there's a loop up at Quantico over where sniper school is.

2826
01:54:12.54 --> 01:54:13.38
You can run over by TVS.

2827
01:54:13.38 --> 01:54:14.46
When you say you got the students off,

2828
01:54:14.46 --> 01:54:15.30
what do you mean?

2829
01:54:15.30 --> 01:54:16.14
You caught them loose?

2830
01:54:16.14 --> 01:54:17.34
No, no, no, like they're just, you know,

2831
01:54:17.34 --> 01:54:18.62
they get them in in the morning.

2832
01:54:18.62 --> 01:54:19.46
They're going to go to the range.

2833
01:54:19.46 --> 01:54:21.26
They're going to do an observation exercise.

2834
01:54:21.26 --> 01:54:22.10
They're going to do, you know what I mean?

2835
01:54:22.10 --> 01:54:23.82
And there's another instructor that has them.

2836
01:54:23.82 --> 01:54:25.98
Cause you know, when, on the instructor cadre,

2837
01:54:25.98 --> 01:54:28.26
you kind of have to manage your time of, you know,

2838
01:54:28.26 --> 01:54:30.14
obviously I got to be there when the students are there

2839
01:54:30.14 --> 01:54:31.14
as the chief instructor.

2840
01:54:31.14 --> 01:54:32.46
And then we got to get the day going.

2841
01:54:32.46 --> 01:54:34.86
If I'm on the platform first or if I'm, so,

2842
01:54:34.86 --> 01:54:37.70
and I always enjoy getting a run in, you know,

2843
01:54:37.70 --> 01:54:39.74
throughout the day, get a chance to work out,

2844
01:54:39.74 --> 01:54:41.90
go to the pool, do something.

2845
01:54:41.90 --> 01:54:44.22
So that day on September 11th, we got, you know,

2846
01:54:44.22 --> 01:54:45.74
we got students on deck.

2847
01:54:45.74 --> 01:54:47.18
We get them off and going and,

2848
01:54:47.18 --> 01:54:49.50
and I take off over towards the FBI Academy.

2849
01:54:49.50 --> 01:54:51.38
So I'm right over there by the FBI Academy

2850
01:54:51.38 --> 01:54:53.46
and the basic school.

2851
01:54:53.46 --> 01:54:56.10
And there's a nine mile loop that goes around.

2852
01:54:56.10 --> 01:54:58.22
And I take off, I let the guys know,

2853
01:54:58.22 --> 01:54:59.58
Hey man, I'm going to go for a run.

2854
01:54:59.58 --> 01:55:00.50
I'm going to run the loop.

2855
01:55:00.50 --> 01:55:03.42
And they know exactly where I'm going.

2856
01:55:03.42 --> 01:55:05.50
And so I'm, I'm off and running.

2857
01:55:05.50 --> 01:55:08.74
And as I'm making my way in and around over by what they,

2858
01:55:08.74 --> 01:55:12.62
they have a called Lake Lunga that's over at Quantico

2859
01:55:12.62 --> 01:55:14.58
next to the FBI Academy.

2860
01:55:14.58 --> 01:55:17.74
And I'm coming in and I'm seeing like a lot of aircraft

2861
01:55:17.74 --> 01:55:18.82
like flying around.

2862
01:55:18.82 --> 01:55:21.22
You know, the FBI always has like stuff going on.

2863
01:55:21.22 --> 01:55:23.90
We got the hostage rescue team that's there as well.

2864
01:55:24.98 --> 01:55:27.38
But then it's just like aircraft like Helos.

2865
01:55:27.38 --> 01:55:28.46
Yeah. Helos and stuff.

2866
01:55:28.46 --> 01:55:30.50
Like it's a lot of activity, which is that,

2867
01:55:30.50 --> 01:55:34.74
but then all the black vehicles are just leaving

2868
01:55:34.74 --> 01:55:36.62
the FBI compound.

2869
01:55:36.62 --> 01:55:38.26
And yeah, cause you got it.

2870
01:55:38.26 --> 01:55:41.22
That's the funny thing about like at Quantico

2871
01:55:41.22 --> 01:55:45.02
that day before we used to not have gates.

2872
01:55:45.02 --> 01:55:49.22
You could literally drive up I 95 and pull off the exit

2873
01:55:49.22 --> 01:55:51.54
and drive straight on to range four

2874
01:55:51.54 --> 01:55:53.90
with the sniper students laying right there on the range.

2875
01:55:53.90 --> 01:55:56.10
And you didn't go through a gate.

2876
01:55:56.10 --> 01:55:58.38
You didn't, nobody checked your ID card.

2877
01:55:58.38 --> 01:56:00.54
Nothing. There was just no gates.

2878
01:56:01.42 --> 01:56:03.46
And so I'm, I'm, I'm running back

2879
01:56:03.46 --> 01:56:05.98
and I'm seeing all these vehicles fly out.

2880
01:56:05.98 --> 01:56:08.10
And by the time I get back to the school house,

2881
01:56:08.10 --> 01:56:10.06
it's kind of like, you know, I'm like, what the,

2882
01:56:10.06 --> 01:56:11.62
what the hell's going on?

2883
01:56:11.62 --> 01:56:15.38
And that's when, you know, the Pentagon's being hit,

2884
01:56:15.38 --> 01:56:18.82
you know, New York, 9 11's being hit.

2885
01:56:18.82 --> 01:56:23.22
And it's just like, it's game on.

2886
01:56:23.22 --> 01:56:26.14
And the world changed in nine, nine miles.

2887
01:56:26.14 --> 01:56:27.74
I mean, within a nine mile run, man,

2888
01:56:27.74 --> 01:56:29.94
the world completely changed.

2889
01:56:29.94 --> 01:56:31.90
We had sandbags, barracks.

2890
01:56:31.90 --> 01:56:33.30
I mean, they're, they're man and gates.

2891
01:56:33.30 --> 01:56:34.70
They're making gates.

2892
01:56:34.70 --> 01:56:37.94
I mean, it was, it was total anarchy in Quantico.

2893
01:56:37.94 --> 01:56:39.50
And as, and as you can imagine, I mean,

2894
01:56:39.50 --> 01:56:43.34
being so close to the Pentagon of them hitting the Pentagon,

2895
01:56:43.34 --> 01:56:44.94
they got guys that are coming in, you know,

2896
01:56:44.94 --> 01:56:47.42
they're wanting to know like how can Marines support?

2897
01:56:47.42 --> 01:56:50.14
That kind of was odd to me that like,

2898
01:56:50.14 --> 01:56:53.02
we didn't have authorization to go out to like help.

2899
01:56:54.14 --> 01:56:54.98
You know what I mean?

2900
01:56:54.98 --> 01:56:56.26
Like you got all these Marines.

2901
01:56:56.26 --> 01:56:58.66
You got all these folks like, why aren't Marines?

2902
01:56:58.66 --> 01:56:59.50
Like, you know what I mean?

2903
01:56:59.50 --> 01:57:01.10
Bring the Marines in.

2904
01:57:01.10 --> 01:57:04.10
But then you have to look at it as like the events over.

2905
01:57:05.26 --> 01:57:06.10
Like, you know what I mean?

2906
01:57:06.10 --> 01:57:06.94
They flew into the buildings.

2907
01:57:06.94 --> 01:57:09.50
You know, we're all thinking like, what's kind of next?

2908
01:57:09.50 --> 01:57:11.02
No, that was it.

2909
01:57:11.02 --> 01:57:12.26
That was the big event.

2910
01:57:12.26 --> 01:57:17.26
And, you know, after that, then everybody knew

2911
01:57:17.78 --> 01:57:21.38
at that point in time, it's go time.

2912
01:57:21.38 --> 01:57:23.90
We're, you know, and the Marines are, you know,

2913
01:57:23.90 --> 01:57:26.14
Army, I'm sure with you guys, with the teams,

2914
01:57:26.14 --> 01:57:28.78
like everybody's watching, thinking, yeah,

2915
01:57:28.78 --> 01:57:31.54
when are we going to deploy?

2916
01:57:31.54 --> 01:57:34.26
When's the first action is going to start coming in?

2917
01:57:35.94 --> 01:57:38.94
But yeah, I was at Quantico.

2918
01:57:38.94 --> 01:57:42.62
So then what happens after that?

2919
01:57:42.62 --> 01:57:45.54
Well, I had met a couple of guys

2920
01:57:47.62 --> 01:57:50.74
through being up there at a sniper school.

2921
01:57:50.74 --> 01:57:53.14
And there was a certain unit,

2922
01:57:53.14 --> 01:57:56.62
and I was hoping to get selection into that.

2923
01:57:56.62 --> 01:57:58.98
It's kind of, you know, one of the guys recommended me.

2924
01:57:58.98 --> 01:58:00.86
So I went in, I went through recommendations.

2925
01:58:00.86 --> 01:58:04.06
And with that, they needed a place for me

2926
01:58:04.06 --> 01:58:07.98
to kind of hang out and await selection,

2927
01:58:07.98 --> 01:58:09.62
like in the national capital region.

2928
01:58:09.62 --> 01:58:14.54
So John Allen was the commandant and midshipman

2929
01:58:14.54 --> 01:58:15.82
at the Naval Academy.

2930
01:58:15.82 --> 01:58:19.10
And I had known him from down in the six Marines.

2931
01:58:19.10 --> 01:58:22.26
And, you know, John Allen was like, yeah, hey,

2932
01:58:22.26 --> 01:58:24.82
I'll take JD, bring him up to the Naval Academy.

2933
01:58:24.82 --> 01:58:25.82
And of course I was like, yeah,

2934
01:58:25.82 --> 01:58:26.98
I'm going to the Naval Academy.

2935
01:58:26.98 --> 01:58:29.58
Like I had never been to Annapolis, Maryland

2936
01:58:29.58 --> 01:58:30.54
a day in my life.

2937
01:58:30.54 --> 01:58:34.14
I didn't, I mean, I knew the Academy,

2938
01:58:34.14 --> 01:58:38.66
but like my perception of a Naval Academy graduate

2939
01:58:38.66 --> 01:58:40.18
was Doug Zembeck.

2940
01:58:41.22 --> 01:58:43.06
Like that's what I expected.

2941
01:58:43.06 --> 01:58:45.46
And then my other guy that I worked with

2942
01:58:45.46 --> 01:58:48.54
at a sniper school was John Bradley.

2943
01:58:48.54 --> 01:58:51.94
John Bradley was a three time national boxing champ

2944
01:58:51.94 --> 01:58:52.86
at the Academy.

2945
01:58:52.86 --> 01:58:55.86
His call sign was big people.

2946
01:58:55.86 --> 01:58:58.34
You know, half black, half German.

2947
01:58:58.34 --> 01:59:00.90
I mean, the dude was like Rambo.

2948
01:59:00.90 --> 01:59:02.22
You know what I mean?

2949
01:59:02.22 --> 01:59:04.06
I'm still really good friends with John Brad.

2950
01:59:04.06 --> 01:59:07.06
He's a great human being.

2951
01:59:07.06 --> 01:59:09.10
But, you know, I used to make fun of them like, you know,

2952
01:59:09.10 --> 01:59:11.34
cause he'd wear like Navy boxing and, you know,

2953
01:59:11.34 --> 01:59:13.46
and of course Doug was a Navy wrestler.

2954
01:59:13.46 --> 01:59:16.22
And I was like, dude, I want my taxpayer dollars back.

2955
01:59:16.22 --> 01:59:19.42
There's no way you guys went to the Naval Academy.

2956
01:59:19.42 --> 01:59:22.26
But that's my perception of the Naval Academy.

2957
01:59:22.26 --> 01:59:25.02
You know, the officers that I had dealt with

2958
01:59:26.02 --> 01:59:27.98
were, they'd come out of the Naval Academy.

2959
01:59:27.98 --> 01:59:30.18
They were top notch.

2960
01:59:30.18 --> 01:59:35.02
So that was, that was my perception going in.

2961
01:59:35.02 --> 01:59:38.26
I can remember when I went up to check into the Naval Academy.

2962
01:59:38.26 --> 01:59:40.30
I like, again, I didn't know where it was.

2963
01:59:40.30 --> 01:59:41.54
I just knew it was in Annapolis.

2964
01:59:41.54 --> 01:59:42.90
So I'm driving around Annapolis.

2965
01:59:42.90 --> 01:59:46.66
I get over top of the Severn Bridge and I'm looking down.

2966
01:59:46.66 --> 01:59:49.58
But I think that's like, it looks like the state capital.

2967
01:59:50.82 --> 01:59:54.10
And there's like two women that are walking across the bridge.

2968
01:59:54.10 --> 01:59:55.14
And I'm like, excuse me, ladies,

2969
01:59:55.14 --> 01:59:57.66
do you guys like know where the Naval Academy is?

2970
01:59:57.66 --> 01:59:59.82
And they're laughing like, dude, that's it.

2971
01:59:59.82 --> 02:00:04.26
I was like, wow, like that's next level.

2972
02:00:04.26 --> 02:00:06.06
Like, I mean, it's impressive.

2973
02:00:07.06 --> 02:00:11.66
So I went down and checked into the Academy

2974
02:00:11.66 --> 02:00:13.02
and, you know, John Allen,

2975
02:00:13.02 --> 02:00:15.38
and at first I really didn't have a job for me to do

2976
02:00:15.38 --> 02:00:19.42
because like the midshipmen had already started.

2977
02:00:19.42 --> 02:00:22.22
And I really didn't know like what I was getting into.

2978
02:00:22.22 --> 02:00:26.38
Like I didn't know like what they do at the Naval Academy.

2979
02:00:26.38 --> 02:00:29.10
And your anticipation is that you're waiting to go to selection

2980
02:00:29.10 --> 02:00:30.58
for a special mission unit

2981
02:00:30.58 --> 02:00:32.94
and you're gonna be there for six months or something

2982
02:00:32.94 --> 02:00:33.86
and then you'll roll out.

2983
02:00:33.86 --> 02:00:35.98
Yep, that's my mindset.

2984
02:00:35.98 --> 02:00:40.66
And, you know, and John Allen, you know, great guy, wicked smart.

2985
02:00:40.66 --> 02:00:43.02
I was super excited because the library

2986
02:00:43.02 --> 02:00:45.54
at the Naval Academy is off the chain.

2987
02:00:45.54 --> 02:00:47.26
I mean, like it's off the chain.

2988
02:00:47.26 --> 02:00:49.94
And I mean, I love a library.

2989
02:00:49.94 --> 02:00:51.26
You know what I mean?

2990
02:00:51.26 --> 02:00:54.26
And I get the, so I mean, there's a lot of history up there.

2991
02:00:54.26 --> 02:00:57.14
I mean, Tecumseh court, you know what I mean?

2992
02:00:57.14 --> 02:00:59.54
Like they got Tecumseh, you know what I mean?

2993
02:00:59.54 --> 02:01:03.38
And so it was a bit of a root of awakening.

2994
02:01:03.38 --> 02:01:05.06
Like, so the first morning kind of like, you know,

2995
02:01:05.06 --> 02:01:07.02
this morning I got up, you know what I mean?

2996
02:01:07.02 --> 02:01:08.14
I'm gonna go for a run.

2997
02:01:08.14 --> 02:01:11.50
So that's how I like to like get myself like situational awareness

2998
02:01:11.50 --> 02:01:13.78
of like get orientated is run.

2999
02:01:13.78 --> 02:01:15.02
So I'll run around.

3000
02:01:15.02 --> 02:01:18.18
So I'm running around Annapolis looking at the town and stuff.

3001
02:01:18.18 --> 02:01:21.34
And I make my way back in and I'm on Tecumseh court.

3002
02:01:21.34 --> 02:01:23.62
And as I'm in Tecumseh court, I'm standing there,

3003
02:01:23.62 --> 02:01:25.34
I'm looking, I mean, they got like monuments

3004
02:01:25.34 --> 02:01:26.38
like all over the place.

3005
02:01:26.38 --> 02:01:29.02
I mean, the chapels there, it's pretty banging.

3006
02:01:29.02 --> 02:01:31.50
They got like a bunch of different poles

3007
02:01:31.50 --> 02:01:33.74
and they got Tecumseh.

3008
02:01:33.74 --> 02:01:35.66
And I'm looking at the Cumsun next thing you know,

3009
02:01:35.66 --> 02:01:38.30
like there's this Navy officer.

3010
02:01:38.30 --> 02:01:40.42
He's like, hey, excuse me, hey, what are you doing?

3011
02:01:40.42 --> 02:01:41.70
And I wasn't wearing anything.

3012
02:01:41.70 --> 02:01:43.18
I said, Marines on it.

3013
02:01:43.18 --> 02:01:45.10
And he's like, hey, you're not allowed to be out here

3014
02:01:45.10 --> 02:01:47.50
in PT gear.

3015
02:01:47.50 --> 02:01:50.78
I was like, am I not on a military installation?

3016
02:01:50.78 --> 02:01:53.58
Like with the Navy, we don't like to PT

3017
02:01:53.58 --> 02:01:55.86
and you don't want us to say, like it was,

3018
02:01:55.86 --> 02:01:59.78
like it was odd, like the rules that they had there

3019
02:01:59.78 --> 02:02:01.38
at the academy.

3020
02:02:01.38 --> 02:02:04.50
And, you know, John Allen sent me over with the football team.

3021
02:02:04.50 --> 02:02:06.98
Where couldn't you be with PT uniform on?

3022
02:02:06.98 --> 02:02:07.82
I don't know.

3023
02:02:07.82 --> 02:02:10.22
They didn't like PT gear being out there

3024
02:02:10.22 --> 02:02:12.22
in Tecumseh court, like where they do like.

3025
02:02:12.22 --> 02:02:13.90
So specifically Tecumseh court?

3026
02:02:13.90 --> 02:02:17.14
Yeah, it's like, I guess it's a ceremonial area.

3027
02:02:17.14 --> 02:02:19.02
Like you're supposed to be like in the Marine Corps,

3028
02:02:19.02 --> 02:02:20.90
like everywhere's a PT area.

3029
02:02:20.90 --> 02:02:21.74
You know what I mean?

3030
02:02:21.74 --> 02:02:23.98
Like you can PT wherever you want.

3031
02:02:23.98 --> 02:02:26.62
You know what I mean? Like I'd never been told,

3032
02:02:26.62 --> 02:02:31.18
don't be out in front of people in this area in PT gear.

3033
02:02:31.18 --> 02:02:32.46
So that was kind of odd.

3034
02:02:32.46 --> 02:02:35.58
And then, you know, so I went over with the football team

3035
02:02:35.58 --> 02:02:38.50
because at first I was like, oh, you know, college football.

3036
02:02:38.50 --> 02:02:41.54
And I asked the coaches like, hey,

3037
02:02:41.54 --> 02:02:42.86
is this like open practice?

3038
02:02:42.86 --> 02:02:44.26
Is it cool if I watch?

3039
02:02:44.26 --> 02:02:46.14
You know, they never like, yeah, dude.

3040
02:02:46.14 --> 02:02:46.98
You know what I mean?

3041
02:02:46.98 --> 02:02:47.82
You can come over and watch.

3042
02:02:47.82 --> 02:02:50.34
And it was Coach Paul Johnson at the time

3043
02:02:50.34 --> 02:02:51.66
and the strength coach and stuff.

3044
02:02:51.66 --> 02:02:54.42
And I went over there and you know, the kids

3045
02:02:54.42 --> 02:02:57.98
on the football team, I would say,

3046
02:02:59.02 --> 02:03:03.46
yeah, I felt out of place at the Naval Academy.

3047
02:03:03.46 --> 02:03:07.34
Like I didn't belong, like there's no Marines in the brochure.

3048
02:03:07.34 --> 02:03:11.42
And there's definitely no Marine gunnies in the brochure.

3049
02:03:11.42 --> 02:03:13.54
There were other gunnies that were there.

3050
02:03:13.54 --> 02:03:15.26
But like you said, I mean, I was there.

3051
02:03:15.26 --> 02:03:16.98
I just come from sniper school.

3052
02:03:16.98 --> 02:03:21.98
I had a different outlook than a lot of the other folks.

3053
02:03:23.26 --> 02:03:24.38
And so when I was over there,

3054
02:03:24.38 --> 02:03:26.50
like the midshipment on the football team,

3055
02:03:26.50 --> 02:03:27.86
like they immediately came over

3056
02:03:27.86 --> 02:03:30.38
and started talking to me, asking me, you know, like,

3057
02:03:30.38 --> 02:03:31.26
hey, who are you?

3058
02:03:31.26 --> 02:03:32.10
What are you doing?

3059
02:03:32.10 --> 02:03:33.38
Cause I wasn't in uniform.

3060
02:03:33.38 --> 02:03:35.02
And I was like, yeah, hey, I'm gunny.

3061
02:03:35.02 --> 02:03:37.78
And that's how I introduced myself to like Coach Paul Johnson

3062
02:03:37.78 --> 02:03:41.26
and I think like, cause the coaches aren't military.

3063
02:03:41.26 --> 02:03:44.42
So I think they thought like my first name was Gunny.

3064
02:03:44.42 --> 02:03:47.86
And still to this day, they call me Gunny, you know,

3065
02:03:47.86 --> 02:03:49.10
which I don't care.

3066
02:03:49.10 --> 02:03:50.44
You know what I mean?

3067
02:03:50.44 --> 02:03:52.46
And the football players and I, man,

3068
02:03:52.46 --> 02:03:54.30
I got to stand out there and watch some of these kids

3069
02:03:54.30 --> 02:03:57.86
that are going to compete on division one level.

3070
02:03:57.86 --> 02:04:01.62
And they joined the academy with not really a lot of hopes

3071
02:04:01.62 --> 02:04:03.46
of going to the NFL.

3072
02:04:04.62 --> 02:04:08.78
But the kids on the team and the athletes that are there

3073
02:04:08.78 --> 02:04:10.82
at the academy, the midshipmen are, I mean,

3074
02:04:10.82 --> 02:04:14.74
they're just, they are really good people.

3075
02:04:14.74 --> 02:04:17.26
You know, I look at them just like they joined them.

3076
02:04:17.26 --> 02:04:19.34
They just read a different brochure than I did.

3077
02:04:19.34 --> 02:04:22.30
And obviously scored like way higher on the SAT

3078
02:04:22.30 --> 02:04:24.62
cause I never took that test.

3079
02:04:24.62 --> 02:04:25.46
You know what I mean?

3080
02:04:25.46 --> 02:04:29.96
But they were like really, really good kids at the academy.

3081
02:04:31.22 --> 02:04:36.22
And I just had a phenomenal experience

3082
02:04:36.22 --> 02:04:38.42
being there with the midshipmen.

3083
02:04:38.42 --> 02:04:40.70
They welcomed me with open arms.

3084
02:04:40.70 --> 02:04:41.70
The midship, I had more fun.

3085
02:04:41.70 --> 02:04:43.82
So what job did you actually get assigned?

3086
02:04:43.82 --> 02:04:45.98
I ended up being a senior enlisted advisor

3087
02:04:45.98 --> 02:04:48.14
for 30th company.

3088
02:04:48.14 --> 02:04:49.66
And so there's, how many companies are there?

3089
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:50.66
There's 30.

3090
02:04:50.66 --> 02:04:51.50
Okay.

3091
02:04:51.50 --> 02:04:54.50
And obviously 30th company had like a bad rap

3092
02:04:54.50 --> 02:04:56.54
before I got there, you know what I mean?

3093
02:04:56.54 --> 02:05:00.38
So they had them living on zero deck right next to the battle,

3094
02:05:00.38 --> 02:05:02.14
the battalion officer.

3095
02:05:02.14 --> 02:05:05.70
Well, the battalion officer was a guy named Allen Eshbock.

3096
02:05:05.70 --> 02:05:07.42
And Allen Eshbock, great guy,

3097
02:05:07.42 --> 02:05:10.58
went to Millersville State up in Pennsylvania,

3098
02:05:10.58 --> 02:05:13.98
ran cross country and he was a Navy captain.

3099
02:05:13.98 --> 02:05:17.74
And I had never really been around a Navy captain.

3100
02:05:17.74 --> 02:05:18.58
You know what I mean?

3101
02:05:18.58 --> 02:05:19.86
Not a lot of them, you know,

3102
02:05:19.86 --> 02:05:23.50
I didn't interact with the ship's captain when I was,

3103
02:05:23.50 --> 02:05:26.94
he didn't come down to sell block and hang out and slap spades.

3104
02:05:27.94 --> 02:05:31.98
You know, so Allen Eshbock, he'd see me up running.

3105
02:05:31.98 --> 02:05:32.82
You know what I mean?

3106
02:05:32.82 --> 02:05:33.90
And he ran cross country.

3107
02:05:33.90 --> 02:05:35.66
He was a surface warfare officer.

3108
02:05:35.66 --> 02:05:37.94
He had the Arleigh Burke, you know,

3109
02:05:37.94 --> 02:05:40.58
he ended up taking over the San Jacinto.

3110
02:05:40.58 --> 02:05:43.82
And you know, I already kind of mentioned my kind of like

3111
02:05:43.82 --> 02:05:47.98
being a ship's captain has got to be like a cool job.

3112
02:05:47.98 --> 02:05:51.78
Well, so Allen started coming running with me in the morning.

3113
02:05:51.78 --> 02:05:53.86
And he lived right there on the yard.

3114
02:05:53.86 --> 02:05:55.86
And like these battalion officers,

3115
02:05:55.86 --> 02:05:58.30
the houses that they get on the Naval Academy

3116
02:05:58.30 --> 02:05:59.66
are pretty banging.

3117
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:01.54
And he would have me over for dinner and stuff.

3118
02:06:01.54 --> 02:06:03.06
I got to know his wife, his kids.

3119
02:06:03.06 --> 02:06:05.46
I mean, he was just a super nice guy.

3120
02:06:05.46 --> 02:06:07.50
And so I ended up having this relationship

3121
02:06:07.50 --> 02:06:10.14
with this Navy, this Navy captain.

3122
02:06:10.14 --> 02:06:11.50
And he was just a great guy.

3123
02:06:11.50 --> 02:06:12.86
We'd be really good friends.

3124
02:06:12.86 --> 02:06:15.26
And we're still friends to this day.

3125
02:06:15.26 --> 02:06:17.62
And he was about ready to roll out

3126
02:06:17.62 --> 02:06:20.66
to go take over the USS San Jac.

3127
02:06:20.66 --> 02:06:21.90
And as he was leaving,

3128
02:06:21.90 --> 02:06:24.58
we were getting a new battalion officer coming in.

3129
02:06:24.58 --> 02:06:26.42
And he's like, hey, he's like, JD is there?

3130
02:06:26.42 --> 02:06:27.26
Which was kind of cool.

3131
02:06:27.26 --> 02:06:29.70
The captain would call me JD.

3132
02:06:29.70 --> 02:06:31.50
And he was like, hey, he's like,

3133
02:06:31.50 --> 02:06:34.42
is there anything I can do for you like before I leave?

3134
02:06:34.42 --> 02:06:35.26
And I was like, yeah,

3135
02:06:35.26 --> 02:06:39.74
can you move 30th company up to eight four?

3136
02:06:39.74 --> 02:06:41.82
So it's the highest point at the Navy.

3137
02:06:41.82 --> 02:06:44.58
Nobody goes to eight four.

3138
02:06:44.58 --> 02:06:47.62
Plus the midshipmen that have to walk the class every day,

3139
02:06:47.62 --> 02:06:49.50
they're gonna have to walk all the way to eight four

3140
02:06:49.50 --> 02:06:51.02
like every single day.

3141
02:06:51.02 --> 02:06:53.26
And you have the midshipmen have to chop.

3142
02:06:53.26 --> 02:06:55.22
They call that chopping where they like run

3143
02:06:55.22 --> 02:06:57.66
and say, go Navy, beat Army.

3144
02:06:57.66 --> 02:06:59.54
And did you see him when you were up there speaking?

3145
02:06:59.54 --> 02:07:00.38
Like they do this chopping.

3146
02:07:00.38 --> 02:07:01.34
Is that punishment?

3147
02:07:01.34 --> 02:07:02.98
Or is that just standard operating procedure?

3148
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:04.18
Just standard operating procedure.

3149
02:07:04.18 --> 02:07:05.78
Like I didn't know what they were doing.

3150
02:07:05.78 --> 02:07:07.98
Like wait, just when you're going from class to class,

3151
02:07:07.98 --> 02:07:09.42
every time you square a corner or something,

3152
02:07:09.42 --> 02:07:11.58
you gotta say like go Navy, beat Army.

3153
02:07:11.58 --> 02:07:12.42
Something like that.

3154
02:07:12.42 --> 02:07:13.74
Yeah. And they call it chopping.

3155
02:07:13.74 --> 02:07:16.46
So it's like they're running and they're in dress shoes,

3156
02:07:16.46 --> 02:07:18.26
which makes absolutely no sense.

3157
02:07:18.26 --> 02:07:19.10
But

3158
02:07:19.10 --> 02:07:20.42
The sense is kind of thrown out the way.

3159
02:07:20.42 --> 02:07:21.74
Yeah, the sense is thrown out the way.

3160
02:07:21.74 --> 02:07:23.22
And so I'm watching these kids like,

3161
02:07:23.22 --> 02:07:24.34
and they're calling it chopping.

3162
02:07:24.34 --> 02:07:25.66
And I'm like, interesting.

3163
02:07:26.50 --> 02:07:27.34
You know what I mean?

3164
02:07:27.34 --> 02:07:28.18
Go Navy, beat Army.

3165
02:07:28.18 --> 02:07:29.02
Okay, I got it.

3166
02:07:29.02 --> 02:07:32.22
So that's a lot of chopping to get up to the top of eight four.

3167
02:07:32.22 --> 02:07:33.06
You know what I mean?

3168
02:07:33.06 --> 02:07:36.18
And then I knew nobody would come visit me.

3169
02:07:36.18 --> 02:07:37.22
People are just lazy.

3170
02:07:37.22 --> 02:07:38.06
You know what I mean?

3171
02:07:38.06 --> 02:07:39.98
Like nobody's going to come up to eight four.

3172
02:07:39.98 --> 02:07:41.30
I'm going to live up on eight four.

3173
02:07:41.30 --> 02:07:42.82
It's going to be great.

3174
02:07:42.82 --> 02:07:44.22
So eight four is a building?

3175
02:07:44.22 --> 02:07:45.06
Yeah, eight four.

3176
02:07:45.06 --> 02:07:46.34
It's like Bancroft Hall.

3177
02:07:46.34 --> 02:07:47.82
Like when you saw Bancroft,

3178
02:07:47.82 --> 02:07:50.86
I was all the way in the very back.

3179
02:07:50.86 --> 02:07:54.34
So I was the farthest away from Tecumsecourt as possible.

3180
02:07:54.34 --> 02:07:58.66
And I was the closest to the football locker as possible.

3181
02:07:58.66 --> 02:08:02.02
And you know, I mean, the athletes

3182
02:08:02.02 --> 02:08:04.70
and the, and being assigned up there,

3183
02:08:05.94 --> 02:08:10.94
it was a great place to be as a, as a senior enlisted.

3184
02:08:12.70 --> 02:08:14.62
Because like, I'm not teaching these kids.

3185
02:08:14.62 --> 02:08:16.34
Like if you're an officer and you got to get,

3186
02:08:16.34 --> 02:08:19.66
like I was there with Randall, Lieutenant Randall was there.

3187
02:08:19.66 --> 02:08:20.50
You know what I mean?

3188
02:08:20.50 --> 02:08:21.94
He was a company officer and like company officers

3189
02:08:21.94 --> 02:08:23.38
have to like teach stuff.

3190
02:08:23.38 --> 02:08:27.98
Like they got to go over to academia and teach doubly

3191
02:08:27.98 --> 02:08:29.62
or they got to like do stuff.

3192
02:08:29.62 --> 02:08:31.02
I'm not teaching doubly.

3193
02:08:31.02 --> 02:08:31.86
You know what I mean?

3194
02:08:31.86 --> 02:08:33.46
And you know, they're not gonna,

3195
02:08:33.46 --> 02:08:35.90
I was, I had to do is like just hang out.

3196
02:08:35.90 --> 02:08:36.74
You know what I mean?

3197
02:08:36.74 --> 02:08:37.62
Like a full-time mentor.

3198
02:08:37.62 --> 02:08:40.06
Yeah. And hang out and just be there for the kids

3199
02:08:40.06 --> 02:08:41.06
if they need anything.

3200
02:08:41.06 --> 02:08:45.14
And, and, and I work with a Navy Lieutenant, great guy.

3201
02:08:45.14 --> 02:08:46.22
It was a lot of fun.

3202
02:08:46.22 --> 02:08:48.58
But I mean, so when the kids go to class, it's like,

3203
02:08:48.58 --> 02:08:51.22
you got nothing to do, but you've got an Olympic pool.

3204
02:08:51.22 --> 02:08:52.50
You've got batting cages.

3205
02:08:52.50 --> 02:08:53.58
You got football cages.

3206
02:08:53.58 --> 02:08:54.66
You got an indoor track.

3207
02:08:54.66 --> 02:08:56.38
You got a sailing center.

3208
02:08:56.38 --> 02:08:57.74
You got soccer fields.

3209
02:08:57.74 --> 02:08:59.18
You got a rifle team.

3210
02:08:59.18 --> 02:09:01.66
You got like, dude, I didn't,

3211
02:09:01.66 --> 02:09:03.18
it was a camp.

3212
02:09:03.18 --> 02:09:05.90
I mean, I literally, it was, I was back at camp

3213
02:09:05.90 --> 02:09:09.34
except like they have like the best facilities,

3214
02:09:09.34 --> 02:09:12.98
like known to man, I'd go out and throw BP for the baseball.

3215
02:09:12.98 --> 02:09:14.94
I'd go out and do, you know, batting practice.

3216
02:09:14.94 --> 02:09:17.46
I just get to know the kids, you know,

3217
02:09:17.46 --> 02:09:18.30
that were going through.

3218
02:09:18.30 --> 02:09:19.78
And if they had questions about, you know,

3219
02:09:19.78 --> 02:09:21.18
joining the Marine Corps and stuff like that.

3220
02:09:21.18 --> 02:09:23.38
And then especially with the football team.

3221
02:09:23.38 --> 02:09:25.66
The one thing that I learned there is like, you know,

3222
02:09:25.66 --> 02:09:28.18
the football players don't have to do like the,

3223
02:09:28.18 --> 02:09:31.18
the Friday parades and they get out of a lot of other stuff.

3224
02:09:31.18 --> 02:09:33.26
They do their own meals and stuff.

3225
02:09:33.26 --> 02:09:35.70
And I think that, you know, there's a lot of folks

3226
02:09:35.70 --> 02:09:38.70
that don't understand what it takes to compete

3227
02:09:38.70 --> 02:09:41.34
at division one level football.

3228
02:09:42.34 --> 02:09:43.18
You know what I mean?

3229
02:09:43.18 --> 02:09:46.06
Like, do other athletes get out of that stuff too?

3230
02:09:46.06 --> 02:09:48.30
No, not like football gets out.

3231
02:09:49.22 --> 02:09:50.34
And I wouldn't really say-

3232
02:09:50.34 --> 02:09:51.18
What about the wrestlers?

3233
02:09:51.18 --> 02:09:52.02
No.

3234
02:09:53.30 --> 02:09:54.26
Soccer players?

3235
02:09:54.26 --> 02:09:55.10
No.

3236
02:09:55.10 --> 02:09:56.42
So it's just football.

3237
02:09:56.42 --> 02:09:57.26
Yeah.

3238
02:09:57.26 --> 02:09:59.86
They, I mean, the other, like the other sports teams,

3239
02:09:59.86 --> 02:10:02.18
if they've got a game, they'll get out of something.

3240
02:10:02.18 --> 02:10:06.46
But like football is, is looked at, I mean,

3241
02:10:07.86 --> 02:10:10.98
is looked at differently at the academy.

3242
02:10:10.98 --> 02:10:14.02
And then you're hiring a coach like coach Paul Johnson.

3243
02:10:14.02 --> 02:10:15.26
He came from Georgia Tech.

3244
02:10:15.26 --> 02:10:16.38
Great guy.

3245
02:10:16.38 --> 02:10:18.46
He's the highest paid guy in the Navy.

3246
02:10:19.54 --> 02:10:22.02
Like this dude makes more than the C and O.

3247
02:10:22.02 --> 02:10:24.10
This is like the head coach at Army makes more

3248
02:10:24.10 --> 02:10:26.10
than the chief of staff of the Army,

3249
02:10:26.10 --> 02:10:28.18
which kind of puts stuff into perspective.

3250
02:10:28.18 --> 02:10:29.02
You know what I mean?

3251
02:10:29.02 --> 02:10:30.50
Like, well, wait a minute, man.

3252
02:10:30.50 --> 02:10:32.50
Like I can make more money being the head coach

3253
02:10:32.50 --> 02:10:34.46
at Navy than the C and O.

3254
02:10:34.46 --> 02:10:35.30
You know what I mean?

3255
02:10:35.30 --> 02:10:38.42
Like, like this dude's driving a nuclear submarine.

3256
02:10:38.42 --> 02:10:39.58
You know what I mean?

3257
02:10:39.58 --> 02:10:41.70
But the football coach, and it's just like, you know,

3258
02:10:41.70 --> 02:10:43.22
Ken Neumott that's there right now.

3259
02:10:43.22 --> 02:10:44.06
Great guy.

3260
02:10:44.06 --> 02:10:46.02
He was an O line coach when I was there.

3261
02:10:46.02 --> 02:10:47.50
And the coaches just doing a job.

3262
02:10:47.50 --> 02:10:50.50
They get hired to do a job, compete at the division one level,

3263
02:10:50.50 --> 02:10:52.78
pack the stands and the football team,

3264
02:10:52.78 --> 02:10:55.54
because of the amount of money that they make, you know,

3265
02:10:55.54 --> 02:10:57.66
at stadiums, ticket sales, stuff like that,

3266
02:10:57.66 --> 02:11:00.10
pays for a lot of the other sports programs

3267
02:11:00.10 --> 02:11:01.58
to be able to take place.

3268
02:11:01.58 --> 02:11:03.02
Yeah, it's gotta be recruiting too.

3269
02:11:03.02 --> 02:11:04.34
They probably take recruiting budgets,

3270
02:11:04.34 --> 02:11:06.66
probably paying that coach's salary.

3271
02:11:06.66 --> 02:11:09.38
Yeah, so, and the coaches are great.

3272
02:11:09.38 --> 02:11:12.06
And the kids that they get on that football team,

3273
02:11:12.06 --> 02:11:14.06
I mean, you know, people are like, oh, they get out

3274
02:11:14.06 --> 02:11:16.98
of the Friday afternoon herd across the grass.

3275
02:11:16.98 --> 02:11:17.82
You know what I mean?

3276
02:11:17.82 --> 02:11:18.86
Like really?

3277
02:11:18.86 --> 02:11:20.50
They're up at five o'clock in the morning.

3278
02:11:20.50 --> 02:11:21.50
They gotta watch films.

3279
02:11:21.50 --> 02:11:22.34
They got tapes.

3280
02:11:22.34 --> 02:11:23.18
They got practice.

3281
02:11:23.18 --> 02:11:24.02
They got weights.

3282
02:11:24.02 --> 02:11:26.90
They got, I mean, they have to perform.

3283
02:11:26.90 --> 02:11:27.74
You know what I mean?

3284
02:11:27.74 --> 02:11:31.02
On Saturday, you know, their weekends, their thanksgivings,

3285
02:11:31.02 --> 02:11:33.62
if they get a bowl game, you know, what they sacrifice

3286
02:11:33.62 --> 02:11:35.54
to be able to play division one football

3287
02:11:35.54 --> 02:11:38.02
and then go serve their country just like everybody else.

3288
02:11:38.02 --> 02:11:41.06
So they're just there on a different aspect.

3289
02:11:41.06 --> 02:11:42.70
I think some of the folks just don't,

3290
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:43.78
they don't look at it that way,

3291
02:11:43.78 --> 02:11:47.06
but the student athletes at the academy are phenomenal.

3292
02:11:47.06 --> 02:11:49.74
I mean, they're just one, the team players.

3293
02:11:49.74 --> 02:11:50.58
You know what I mean?

3294
02:11:50.58 --> 02:11:55.18
Like if you leave a team sport from the academy

3295
02:11:55.18 --> 02:11:56.58
and join the Marine Corps,

3296
02:11:56.58 --> 02:11:58.66
it's a very easy transition.

3297
02:11:58.66 --> 02:12:00.66
You know, because you're just leaving one team

3298
02:12:00.66 --> 02:12:03.02
and you're just joining another team.

3299
02:12:03.02 --> 02:12:07.50
And the athletes transition really well into the Marine Corps.

3300
02:12:08.78 --> 02:12:11.34
And you know, I just think that the kids

3301
02:12:11.34 --> 02:12:12.30
that were on the team, I mean,

3302
02:12:12.30 --> 02:12:16.38
they, I had like a lot of fun with those kids.

3303
02:12:16.38 --> 02:12:17.50
And then, you know, some of them,

3304
02:12:17.50 --> 02:12:19.38
when they select Marines at the end of the year,

3305
02:12:19.38 --> 02:12:22.06
you got like, oh, line guys, you got defensive line guys

3306
02:12:22.06 --> 02:12:25.78
that have never run farther than 100 yards in their life.

3307
02:12:25.78 --> 02:12:27.86
And now it's the end of football season.

3308
02:12:27.86 --> 02:12:29.02
And oh, hey, by the way,

3309
02:12:29.02 --> 02:12:31.90
you got to meet height and weight standards by May.

3310
02:12:31.90 --> 02:12:35.34
Yeah, that's hard for some of the guys that go to Buds.

3311
02:12:35.34 --> 02:12:38.78
You know, they got to like totally change their physique.

3312
02:12:38.78 --> 02:12:41.70
Like they got to become a different kind of human being.

3313
02:12:41.70 --> 02:12:45.42
Like I got one friend that was at the Naval Academy

3314
02:12:45.42 --> 02:12:48.30
played football and I don't want to say his nickname,

3315
02:12:48.30 --> 02:12:50.10
but he's a big guy.

3316
02:12:50.10 --> 02:12:53.54
And even when I know him, he's a big guy, like a big guy.

3317
02:12:53.54 --> 02:12:55.58
But apparently I didn't know him when he played football,

3318
02:12:55.58 --> 02:13:00.50
but he had to like change who he was as a human being

3319
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:04.14
to get from playing whatever freaking linemen

3320
02:13:04.14 --> 02:13:07.90
at the Naval Academy to go and run, you know,

3321
02:13:07.90 --> 02:13:10.98
12 miles and four miles and six miles.

3322
02:13:10.98 --> 02:13:12.42
And you know, like all that running.

3323
02:13:12.42 --> 02:13:14.94
Just to tell you, you're a different human.

3324
02:13:14.94 --> 02:13:15.78
Yeah.

3325
02:13:15.78 --> 02:13:16.62
That's a challenge.

3326
02:13:16.62 --> 02:13:19.10
Yeah, and then you got to teach them how to run.

3327
02:13:19.10 --> 02:13:22.22
Like, you know, some of them just, they don't,

3328
02:13:22.22 --> 02:13:23.50
I mean, there's a big difference

3329
02:13:23.50 --> 02:13:27.94
between sprinting a hundred yards and running three miles.

3330
02:13:27.94 --> 02:13:31.06
And then, oh, by the way, you're going to go to TBS.

3331
02:13:31.06 --> 02:13:31.90
You know what I mean?

3332
02:13:31.90 --> 02:13:32.74
Especially if you go to Marines,

3333
02:13:32.74 --> 02:13:34.10
but even if they're, if they're going,

3334
02:13:34.10 --> 02:13:35.62
you know, surface warfare or going to,

3335
02:13:35.62 --> 02:13:40.06
I mean, that's a big transition for a lot of those guys

3336
02:13:40.06 --> 02:13:42.02
that are out there and, you know,

3337
02:13:42.02 --> 02:13:43.70
and I would run them in a mile and a half.

3338
02:13:43.70 --> 02:13:44.82
The only thing that I could do,

3339
02:13:44.82 --> 02:13:49.10
my biggest shock when I was at the Academy was like,

3340
02:13:49.10 --> 02:13:50.90
I was talking to some of the, Mitch,

3341
02:13:50.90 --> 02:13:52.86
and one of them was, it was Jason Copeland.

3342
02:13:52.86 --> 02:13:54.38
He's a Marine Lieutenant Colonel now.

3343
02:13:54.38 --> 02:13:55.86
He's the Amphitrubitian Commander.

3344
02:13:55.86 --> 02:13:58.22
Great human being.

3345
02:13:58.22 --> 02:13:59.46
So Jason, I was like, hey,

3346
02:13:59.46 --> 02:14:01.22
what do we guys got going on tomorrow morning?

3347
02:14:01.22 --> 02:14:03.02
Like, you guys got your physical fitness test.

3348
02:14:03.02 --> 02:14:06.18
I heard, because I didn't know like what these kids did.

3349
02:14:06.18 --> 02:14:08.66
And he's like, yeah, we'll meet out by the,

3350
02:14:08.66 --> 02:14:10.18
by the Farragut and, you know,

3351
02:14:10.18 --> 02:14:14.02
the PT department takes care of the physical fitness test.

3352
02:14:14.02 --> 02:14:16.38
And they run the PRT and I was like, oh yeah, what is it?

3353
02:14:16.38 --> 02:14:17.22
You know what I mean?

3354
02:14:17.22 --> 02:14:19.38
Okay, well we do, you know, pushups, setups,

3355
02:14:19.38 --> 02:14:20.74
and then we do a mile and a half run.

3356
02:14:20.74 --> 02:14:21.58
I was like, okay, that's cool.

3357
02:14:21.58 --> 02:14:22.42
What time do you go?

3358
02:14:22.42 --> 02:14:24.78
I'd like to come out.

3359
02:14:24.78 --> 02:14:26.82
Well, most of the staff there are like,

3360
02:14:26.82 --> 02:14:28.38
why, it's early in the morning.

3361
02:14:28.38 --> 02:14:29.90
Like, why are you gunning?

3362
02:14:29.90 --> 02:14:31.58
Why are you, you don't have to go.

3363
02:14:31.58 --> 02:14:35.34
I was like, well, I know I don't have to go,

3364
02:14:35.34 --> 02:14:40.34
but I should go and run with the kids.

3365
02:14:40.42 --> 02:14:43.22
So I showed up and they do each battalion.

3366
02:14:43.22 --> 02:14:47.50
So there's six battalions and each battalion gets a day

3367
02:14:47.50 --> 02:14:50.30
and they show up and there's, you know, five battalions

3368
02:14:50.30 --> 02:14:52.38
and, or five companies and each battalion,

3369
02:14:52.38 --> 02:14:56.10
they're gonna run five physical readiness tests.

3370
02:14:56.10 --> 02:14:58.46
So I show up and, you know,

3371
02:14:58.46 --> 02:15:00.86
they're only gonna run a mile and a half.

3372
02:15:00.86 --> 02:15:03.02
So, you know, so for me, I was like, well,

3373
02:15:03.02 --> 02:15:05.46
I asked the PE guy, like, do you care

3374
02:15:05.46 --> 02:15:07.06
if I like run with them?

3375
02:15:07.06 --> 02:15:08.90
Am I allowed to run with them?

3376
02:15:08.90 --> 02:15:09.74
You know what I mean?

3377
02:15:09.74 --> 02:15:12.02
Like I'll do a 10, 30 pace, just run along.

3378
02:15:12.02 --> 02:15:12.86
And, you know what I mean?

3379
02:15:12.86 --> 02:15:15.94
Kind of give the kids an earmark of like where I'm at.

3380
02:15:15.94 --> 02:15:17.90
Cause I used to do that at cyber school.

3381
02:15:17.90 --> 02:15:19.78
Like if I'd run the three mile and I'm like,

3382
02:15:19.78 --> 02:15:24.78
hey, I'm gonna run right at a, of what is a 20, 30 pace.

3383
02:15:26.02 --> 02:15:28.70
So for three miles, I'm gonna run it in 20 minutes

3384
02:15:28.70 --> 02:15:32.02
and 30 seconds because that's worth 85 points.

3385
02:15:32.02 --> 02:15:34.94
So if you see JD, he's worth 85 points.

3386
02:15:34.94 --> 02:15:36.06
If you're in front of me, you know what I mean?

3387
02:15:36.06 --> 02:15:37.38
Cause it's all the numbers game.

3388
02:15:37.38 --> 02:15:39.78
If you're not good at pullups, you better bank it on the run.

3389
02:15:39.78 --> 02:15:40.66
If you're not, you know what I mean?

3390
02:15:40.66 --> 02:15:42.62
So it's your strength and weaknesses.

3391
02:15:42.62 --> 02:15:44.14
So I was like, you know, and I was like, okay,

3392
02:15:44.14 --> 02:15:45.98
this is the naval academy.

3393
02:15:45.98 --> 02:15:47.38
Like it's only a mile and a half.

3394
02:15:47.38 --> 02:15:48.66
You got to do it in 10, 30.

3395
02:15:48.66 --> 02:15:49.82
That's seven minute pace, man.

3396
02:15:49.82 --> 02:15:50.78
It's pretty easy.

3397
02:15:51.78 --> 02:15:54.38
So as I'm out there and I'm watching the kids

3398
02:15:54.38 --> 02:15:55.90
and I'm running along with them, you know,

3399
02:15:55.90 --> 02:15:56.94
kind of going along and I'm like,

3400
02:15:56.94 --> 02:15:58.42
hey, where, where, where are these guys going?

3401
02:15:58.42 --> 02:15:59.38
Like they're falling out.

3402
02:15:59.38 --> 02:16:01.46
Like where it's only a mile and a half and they're falling out.

3403
02:16:01.46 --> 02:16:04.06
And I was just like, well, they, they failed.

3404
02:16:04.06 --> 02:16:05.38
Like they didn't pass the run.

3405
02:16:05.38 --> 02:16:08.18
So I go over to the PE department and I'm kind of like,

3406
02:16:08.18 --> 02:16:09.42
so what happens to these kids, man?

3407
02:16:09.42 --> 02:16:10.30
They like pack their shit.

3408
02:16:10.30 --> 02:16:11.14
They done.

3409
02:16:11.14 --> 02:16:13.38
And they're like, no, remediate.

3410
02:16:13.38 --> 02:16:14.22
You know what I mean?

3411
02:16:14.22 --> 02:16:16.54
They're going to remediate the hell out of them.

3412
02:16:16.54 --> 02:16:18.94
And I always thought like, well, this is something

3413
02:16:18.94 --> 02:16:21.90
that I could help out.

3414
02:16:21.90 --> 02:16:24.42
You know, I can, I can come out and run with these kids.

3415
02:16:24.42 --> 02:16:28.46
And so I used to go run when they do the PRTs

3416
02:16:28.46 --> 02:16:30.62
for the, for the brigade of midshipmen.

3417
02:16:30.62 --> 02:16:35.62
I would run 30 of them back to back at a 10, 30 pace.

3418
02:16:36.98 --> 02:16:39.54
And I was like, yeah, only five a day though.

3419
02:16:39.54 --> 02:16:40.38
Oh, okay.

3420
02:16:40.38 --> 02:16:41.22
So, you know what I mean?

3421
02:16:41.22 --> 02:16:42.06
It's really not that hard.

3422
02:16:42.06 --> 02:16:43.90
It's only like eight, eight and a half miles.

3423
02:16:43.90 --> 02:16:44.74
You know what I mean?

3424
02:16:44.74 --> 02:16:46.86
And for me, I'm not a runner.

3425
02:16:46.86 --> 02:16:48.82
I just have a running problem.

3426
02:16:48.82 --> 02:16:49.66
You know what I mean?

3427
02:16:49.66 --> 02:16:52.30
So for me, like that seven minute pace was, you know,

3428
02:16:52.30 --> 02:16:53.82
it's a pretty good workout for me.

3429
02:16:53.82 --> 02:16:56.90
I'd come out and I would run with the kids and kind of,

3430
02:16:56.90 --> 02:16:57.74
you know what I mean?

3431
02:16:57.74 --> 02:17:00.26
And, you know, kind of help them and push them.

3432
02:17:00.26 --> 02:17:01.50
Like if they're going to fall back,

3433
02:17:01.50 --> 02:17:04.90
this is something that I can actually, you know,

3434
02:17:04.90 --> 02:17:06.22
help out with the naval academy.

3435
02:17:06.22 --> 02:17:08.18
If there's a kid struggling with a mile and a half,

3436
02:17:08.18 --> 02:17:11.26
I can help him out and get him to pass so that, you know,

3437
02:17:11.26 --> 02:17:13.18
because once he goes to the fleet and he's in the Navy,

3438
02:17:13.18 --> 02:17:17.10
that's not a required, 1030 is not a requirement in the fleet.

3439
02:17:17.10 --> 02:17:20.58
It's just the naval academy requirement for officers.

3440
02:17:20.58 --> 02:17:21.62
So, but hopefully, yeah.

3441
02:17:21.62 --> 02:17:26.10
So I used to do that with the kids and I would get excited.

3442
02:17:26.10 --> 02:17:26.94
You know what I mean?

3443
02:17:26.94 --> 02:17:30.22
To go out and run the PRTs with the midshipmen.

3444
02:17:30.22 --> 02:17:32.34
Cause I mean, it was hysterical.

3445
02:17:32.34 --> 02:17:36.06
Just, you know, watching them for the mile and a half.

3446
02:17:36.06 --> 02:17:41.06
How is the psychological molding of the guys

3447
02:17:41.06 --> 02:17:45.34
or the people or the kids that are going to the naval academy

3448
02:17:45.34 --> 02:17:47.70
compared to what you saw at bootcamp?

3449
02:17:49.62 --> 02:17:54.38
Well, it's, yeah, there's, it's the country club.

3450
02:17:55.46 --> 02:17:57.98
Yeah, I would say it's kind of like being a Catholic school

3451
02:17:57.98 --> 02:17:59.42
and you're just a nun.

3452
02:17:59.42 --> 02:18:00.26
You know what I mean?

3453
02:18:00.26 --> 02:18:01.10
You're a nun.

3454
02:18:02.18 --> 02:18:04.70
Yeah, it's, it's, it's not, yeah, it's night and day.

3455
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:08.10
You know, they do plebe summer that's there,

3456
02:18:08.10 --> 02:18:11.38
but it's the, it's the upper class

3457
02:18:11.38 --> 02:18:12.90
are kind of running plebe summer.

3458
02:18:12.90 --> 02:18:15.50
And they do, I mean, they do a pretty good job,

3459
02:18:15.50 --> 02:18:17.26
but they're not drill instructors.

3460
02:18:17.26 --> 02:18:18.10
You know what I mean?

3461
02:18:18.10 --> 02:18:18.94
They're not smoking it out.

3462
02:18:18.94 --> 02:18:22.02
They're not, you know, the shock and all isn't as much,

3463
02:18:22.02 --> 02:18:25.42
but they do a, they do a pretty good job with them

3464
02:18:25.42 --> 02:18:28.22
at a plebe summer and, you know, and being a plebe

3465
02:18:28.22 --> 02:18:29.94
at the naval academy to me was like,

3466
02:18:29.94 --> 02:18:32.02
dude, that just does not look like fun.

3467
02:18:32.02 --> 02:18:32.86
Yeah, it looks awful.

3468
02:18:32.86 --> 02:18:34.02
Like at all.

3469
02:18:34.02 --> 02:18:36.18
One, I gotta say, go Navy beat army

3470
02:18:36.18 --> 02:18:39.14
and chop around the place in my dress shoes.

3471
02:18:39.14 --> 02:18:40.70
You know, I know liberty.

3472
02:18:40.70 --> 02:18:42.66
I don't get to really do anything.

3473
02:18:42.66 --> 02:18:45.54
I, you know, the knowledge that they push

3474
02:18:45.54 --> 02:18:46.86
on those kids there though,

3475
02:18:46.86 --> 02:18:49.50
and the, and the education level is phenomenal.

3476
02:18:49.50 --> 02:18:53.50
And then I would say like the, the comradery of the,

3477
02:18:53.50 --> 02:18:57.54
of each class is just, it's outstanding

3478
02:18:57.54 --> 02:19:00.42
with the naval academy of bringing those kids together,

3479
02:19:00.42 --> 02:19:04.10
you know, sharing and, and the, and the suffering together

3480
02:19:04.10 --> 02:19:07.50
all four years at the academy.

3481
02:19:07.50 --> 02:19:09.58
But it is a, it's a great institution

3482
02:19:09.58 --> 02:19:14.58
and they put out a, a great product in my opinion.

3483
02:19:14.62 --> 02:19:18.18
Probably the, the best to watch was the ones

3484
02:19:18.18 --> 02:19:21.10
that wanted to go special warfare, Navy seals.

3485
02:19:21.10 --> 02:19:24.18
That was the most while I was there, you know,

3486
02:19:24.18 --> 02:19:28.94
Randall was a lieutenant and he kind of ran that pre-buds

3487
02:19:28.94 --> 02:19:30.78
kind of selection process there.

3488
02:19:30.78 --> 02:19:32.38
It's a tight selection.

3489
02:19:32.38 --> 02:19:34.26
Oh, it is the most comp, I mean,

3490
02:19:34.26 --> 02:19:36.74
he's got like a couple of hundred kids that want to be,

3491
02:19:36.74 --> 02:19:38.38
I mean, there's only a thousand of them

3492
02:19:38.38 --> 02:19:40.66
and a couple hundred of them want to become a seal.

3493
02:19:40.66 --> 02:19:43.22
Yeah. And there's like 15 billets,

3494
02:19:43.22 --> 02:19:44.86
something like that, 15 slots.

3495
02:19:44.86 --> 02:19:48.34
Yeah. And yeah, I've been, it's always been cool.

3496
02:19:48.34 --> 02:19:50.46
I've done, during COVID, I did some,

3497
02:19:51.34 --> 02:19:56.02
some virtual training with the, with the midshipmen.

3498
02:19:56.02 --> 02:19:57.02
I've gone there alive.

3499
02:19:57.02 --> 02:19:59.34
It's been awesome to go up there alive and, and just,

3500
02:19:59.34 --> 02:20:01.18
you know, talk about leadership from my perspective.

3501
02:20:01.18 --> 02:20:03.34
And they're definitely stoked on it.

3502
02:20:03.34 --> 02:20:04.18
Very cool.

3503
02:20:04.18 --> 02:20:06.98
But yeah, that competitiveness for the seal billets,

3504
02:20:06.98 --> 02:20:08.82
in any, whether you're ROT, in the,

3505
02:20:08.82 --> 02:20:11.22
any of the officer seal billets is,

3506
02:20:11.22 --> 02:20:13.70
it's hard, it's very, very difficult.

3507
02:20:13.70 --> 02:20:15.98
Probably, well, because the recruiting,

3508
02:20:15.98 --> 02:20:19.86
because so many people want to go into, to that job.

3509
02:20:20.74 --> 02:20:22.98
And it's a rough job to get into.

3510
02:20:22.98 --> 02:20:25.30
Yeah, I would say, yeah.

3511
02:20:25.30 --> 02:20:27.18
But what those kids would, you know,

3512
02:20:27.18 --> 02:20:29.30
the thing that, that I learned while I was there,

3513
02:20:29.30 --> 02:20:32.22
was kind of disappointing for me being a Marine,

3514
02:20:33.18 --> 02:20:34.86
was the, the Marine selection.

3515
02:20:34.86 --> 02:20:36.66
So you would have like, you know, I mean,

3516
02:20:36.66 --> 02:20:38.54
let's say you got a hundred kids that put,

3517
02:20:38.54 --> 02:20:41.14
they want to go Navy SEALs as another choice.

3518
02:20:41.14 --> 02:20:43.82
And then Marine ground as their second.

3519
02:20:43.82 --> 02:20:46.18
And you would have Marines that were up on the yard,

3520
02:20:46.18 --> 02:20:47.30
going, that's bullshit.

3521
02:20:47.30 --> 02:20:48.14
You know what I mean?

3522
02:20:48.14 --> 02:20:49.58
If they're not Marine first, we don't want,

3523
02:20:49.58 --> 02:20:51.38
I'm like, these kids are going after,

3524
02:20:51.38 --> 02:20:55.14
like if, if JD was there, who wouldn't,

3525
02:20:55.14 --> 02:20:56.86
it's the Naval Academy, man.

3526
02:20:56.86 --> 02:20:58.94
Like, I mean, they want to go Navy SEAL.

3527
02:20:58.94 --> 02:21:02.14
They're going to compete for the hardest billet going.

3528
02:21:02.14 --> 02:21:03.26
Yeah.

3529
02:21:03.26 --> 02:21:04.46
You know, at least physically.

3530
02:21:04.46 --> 02:21:06.10
Yeah, that's actually another way to look at it,

3531
02:21:06.10 --> 02:21:08.94
is, hey, these guys want the hardest possible job.

3532
02:21:08.94 --> 02:21:10.14
And they're trying to get in the heart,

3533
02:21:10.14 --> 02:21:11.74
the most selective thing.

3534
02:21:11.74 --> 02:21:13.94
So they're taking the most selective thing.

3535
02:21:13.94 --> 02:21:15.50
That's the SEAL billet.

3536
02:21:15.50 --> 02:21:16.50
If they don't get that.

3537
02:21:16.50 --> 02:21:17.46
Yeah, cause that is horrible.

3538
02:21:17.46 --> 02:21:19.42
And I had, I've had a bunch of friends, you know,

3539
02:21:19.42 --> 02:21:20.90
that graduated from the Naval Academy,

3540
02:21:20.90 --> 02:21:23.18
that had to make that call.

3541
02:21:23.18 --> 02:21:24.98
And it's so hard.

3542
02:21:24.98 --> 02:21:28.06
I mean, LEAF didn't get selected out of the Naval Academy.

3543
02:21:28.06 --> 02:21:29.78
SEAF didn't get selected out of the Navy.

3544
02:21:29.78 --> 02:21:32.42
And they both went to, you know, a ship.

3545
02:21:32.42 --> 02:21:35.10
And that's a different personality type

3546
02:21:35.10 --> 02:21:37.94
that is going to be a ship, a swell.

3547
02:21:37.94 --> 02:21:40.38
It's a different, it's a different type of mindset

3548
02:21:40.38 --> 02:21:44.38
than someone that's going to be some kind of a land soldier.

3549
02:21:44.38 --> 02:21:46.86
You know, whether it's a Marine or a special operations guy,

3550
02:21:46.86 --> 02:21:49.34
it's a different type of mindset you have to have.

3551
02:21:49.34 --> 02:21:53.18
And so both, I forget, I have to ask Leif again,

3552
02:21:53.18 --> 02:21:54.50
but you know, he got told the same thing.

3553
02:21:54.50 --> 02:21:58.90
He's like, Hey, there's, it's a waste to put Marine Corps

3554
02:21:58.90 --> 02:22:01.98
after SEALs cause yours is not going to get taken.

3555
02:22:01.98 --> 02:22:03.86
And Leif, you know, would have loved

3556
02:22:03.86 --> 02:22:06.18
if he didn't make it into SEALs, but you know,

3557
02:22:07.18 --> 02:22:09.14
he probably would have gotten picked up for the Marine Corps

3558
02:22:09.14 --> 02:22:11.18
and probably would have never joined the SEAL teams.

3559
02:22:11.18 --> 02:22:13.78
And the Marine Corps would have had a cool officer.

3560
02:22:13.78 --> 02:22:15.18
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of like,

3561
02:22:15.18 --> 02:22:17.74
I knew a lot of these kids, like they would come out and like,

3562
02:22:17.74 --> 02:22:19.78
cause I would run every morning at five.

3563
02:22:20.70 --> 02:22:21.54
You know what I mean?

3564
02:22:21.54 --> 02:22:23.78
So I'd go run and, and I ran a lot like,

3565
02:22:23.78 --> 02:22:27.22
they had a marathon team that was there at the academy.

3566
02:22:27.22 --> 02:22:29.30
So I became like the O-Rap for them.

3567
02:22:29.30 --> 02:22:31.98
So like the Naval Academy would like fly us around.

3568
02:22:31.98 --> 02:22:34.50
So I mean, we're doing Chicago, we're doing Boston,

3569
02:22:34.50 --> 02:22:37.26
we're doing Disney, you know what I mean?

3570
02:22:37.26 --> 02:22:39.34
Like with the midshipmen and, and you know,

3571
02:22:39.34 --> 02:22:42.70
and if they knew that like midshipmen can't leave the yard,

3572
02:22:42.70 --> 02:22:44.22
but if they're running with me,

3573
02:22:44.22 --> 02:22:46.26
then they're allowed to just say, I'm with Gunny,

3574
02:22:46.26 --> 02:22:47.10
you know what I mean?

3575
02:22:47.10 --> 02:22:49.38
And they right out the gate, we'd go run through town.

3576
02:22:49.38 --> 02:22:52.14
So they're not just doing like outers around the academy

3577
02:22:52.14 --> 02:22:53.14
and stuff.

3578
02:22:53.14 --> 02:22:56.38
And you would see just the commitment that those kids had

3579
02:22:56.38 --> 02:22:58.70
that are trying to compete for those billets to include

3580
02:22:58.70 --> 02:23:01.86
the EOD billets as well that are coming out as a,

3581
02:23:01.86 --> 02:23:03.82
you know, as a naval officer to get those billets

3582
02:23:03.82 --> 02:23:06.90
are very hard to get.

3583
02:23:06.90 --> 02:23:10.50
And for us to like miss out on some of those guys and gals

3584
02:23:10.50 --> 02:23:12.58
that, okay, that's great that they put Navy SEAL

3585
02:23:12.58 --> 02:23:14.18
or whatever for the first choice.

3586
02:23:14.18 --> 02:23:16.18
They want Marine's second choice.

3587
02:23:16.18 --> 02:23:17.86
Like they're going to be good.

3588
02:23:17.86 --> 02:23:18.74
Like, you know what I mean?

3589
02:23:18.74 --> 02:23:22.30
Like that did, and they let me sit in on one of these

3590
02:23:22.30 --> 02:23:23.82
selection boards, which was very,

3591
02:23:23.82 --> 02:23:25.66
I'd never been on an officer selection.

3592
02:23:25.66 --> 02:23:26.50
SEAL selection board?

3593
02:23:26.50 --> 02:23:27.62
No, no, no, Marines.

3594
02:23:27.62 --> 02:23:28.46
Oh, okay.

3595
02:23:28.46 --> 02:23:30.10
And everybody's got like these little hidden buttons.

3596
02:23:30.10 --> 02:23:31.10
You know what I mean?

3597
02:23:31.10 --> 02:23:32.46
Of whether or not like you want to vote,

3598
02:23:32.46 --> 02:23:34.98
like yes or no, which I kind of thought was bullshit

3599
02:23:34.98 --> 02:23:36.78
that we're kind of hiding the button.

3600
02:23:36.78 --> 02:23:38.70
Like, dude, you could put my button right out in front

3601
02:23:38.70 --> 02:23:39.54
of everybody.

3602
02:23:39.54 --> 02:23:40.36
You know what I mean?

3603
02:23:40.36 --> 02:23:41.34
Like, nope, don't like that one.

3604
02:23:41.34 --> 02:23:42.98
Everybody can see, you know what I mean?

3605
02:23:42.98 --> 02:23:44.34
That, oh, JD doesn't like him.

3606
02:23:44.34 --> 02:23:46.06
Nope, don't like him.

3607
02:23:46.06 --> 02:23:49.46
And, you know, we had this, this one kid and he's a nice,

3608
02:23:49.46 --> 02:23:51.62
he was a nice kid.

3609
02:23:51.62 --> 02:23:53.94
But there's a lot of nice kids that shouldn't be

3610
02:23:53.94 --> 02:23:55.58
a Marine officer.

3611
02:23:55.58 --> 02:23:59.06
And this guy, like, we're in there.

3612
02:23:59.06 --> 02:24:02.10
And Colonel Inman was the senior Marine on the yard

3613
02:24:02.10 --> 02:24:02.94
at the time.

3614
02:24:02.94 --> 02:24:04.66
And Colonel Inman, great guy.

3615
02:24:04.66 --> 02:24:09.10
Went to the University of Oklahoma, just a phenomenal guy.

3616
02:24:09.10 --> 02:24:10.54
And he's the one that had me in there.

3617
02:24:10.54 --> 02:24:12.50
He's like, yeah, hey, JD, you would like your input.

3618
02:24:12.50 --> 02:24:14.06
You know a lot of these kids.

3619
02:24:14.06 --> 02:24:14.90
You know what I mean?

3620
02:24:14.90 --> 02:24:15.74
I was like, okay, yeah, cool.

3621
02:24:15.74 --> 02:24:18.06
I've never been in here before.

3622
02:24:18.06 --> 02:24:19.98
So I'm sitting there looking and they got a show a picture

3623
02:24:19.98 --> 02:24:22.30
and somebody's going to brief their package kind of thing.

3624
02:24:22.30 --> 02:24:24.54
And then you do the little hidden vote.

3625
02:24:24.54 --> 02:24:26.10
And then, you know, they see on the board,

3626
02:24:26.10 --> 02:24:27.94
okay, yeah, this guy got enough votes.

3627
02:24:27.94 --> 02:24:29.86
He's going to go in the go-powl.

3628
02:24:29.86 --> 02:24:31.26
So he's just going to go in the go-powl.

3629
02:24:31.26 --> 02:24:34.38
They got this one kid that they put up on there.

3630
02:24:34.38 --> 02:24:38.38
And I'm like, oh, this guy, nice kid, seabag with lips, man.

3631
02:24:38.38 --> 02:24:41.06
Like, TBS is going to crush him.

3632
02:24:41.06 --> 02:24:41.90
You know what I mean?

3633
02:24:41.90 --> 02:24:43.74
Like, the heart's there.

3634
02:24:43.74 --> 02:24:46.50
It's just, you know, he's just, he's not going to work out

3635
02:24:46.50 --> 02:24:47.86
as a Marine officer.

3636
02:24:47.86 --> 02:24:48.70
You know what I mean?

3637
02:24:48.70 --> 02:24:51.62
He doesn't have the self-discipline.

3638
02:24:51.62 --> 02:24:55.02
So of course I hit the no and he goes to the go-powl.

3639
02:24:56.90 --> 02:24:58.86
So I'm a little shocked.

3640
02:24:58.86 --> 02:25:04.02
So I was like, excuse me, sir, like, who voted for that guy?

3641
02:25:04.02 --> 02:25:06.10
Like, does anybody here like know him?

3642
02:25:06.10 --> 02:25:09.02
Like, no shit, like, you know the guy.

3643
02:25:09.02 --> 02:25:10.66
Like I've seen him out there

3644
02:25:10.66 --> 02:25:13.70
on the remedial physical fitness field.

3645
02:25:13.70 --> 02:25:14.54
You know what I mean?

3646
02:25:14.54 --> 02:25:16.34
Trying to pass a 10-30.

3647
02:25:16.34 --> 02:25:20.14
Like I looked at it as if we're going to stamp a kid

3648
02:25:20.14 --> 02:25:22.58
with the little n-star from the Naval Academy,

3649
02:25:22.58 --> 02:25:24.98
we're going to send him down to TBS,

3650
02:25:24.98 --> 02:25:26.98
then all of my peers that know

3651
02:25:26.98 --> 02:25:28.86
that I'm at the Naval Academy are like,

3652
02:25:28.86 --> 02:25:31.02
oh, this is JD's guys.

3653
02:25:31.02 --> 02:25:31.86
You know what I mean?

3654
02:25:31.86 --> 02:25:34.02
I don't want JD's name on this guy

3655
02:25:34.02 --> 02:25:36.58
because he's not going to fare well

3656
02:25:36.58 --> 02:25:38.50
when they do the physical fitness aspects.

3657
02:25:38.50 --> 02:25:40.26
And he's like, well, I mean, it's a,

3658
02:25:40.26 --> 02:25:41.98
you know, we don't disclose who's voting.

3659
02:25:41.98 --> 02:25:43.66
I was just like, I mean, I'm being serious.

3660
02:25:43.66 --> 02:25:44.82
Like, does anybody know this kid?

3661
02:25:44.82 --> 02:25:46.42
Like, I know this kid.

3662
02:25:46.42 --> 02:25:49.78
Like he's, we're setting him up for failure.

3663
02:25:49.78 --> 02:25:53.90
And basically, Colonel Emmond says, well, JD, he's legacy.

3664
02:25:54.74 --> 02:25:57.82
And I'm like, okay, well, that's a new one.

3665
02:25:57.82 --> 02:25:59.90
What's legacy?

3666
02:25:59.90 --> 02:26:01.50
Well, his dad was a Marine officer.

3667
02:26:02.66 --> 02:26:06.50
So then I was like, okay, so we're getting flounder.

3668
02:26:06.50 --> 02:26:08.30
Remember an animal house when, you know,

3669
02:26:08.30 --> 02:26:11.38
they took flounder because he was legacy?

3670
02:26:11.38 --> 02:26:14.02
I was like, so we're going to get flounder

3671
02:26:14.02 --> 02:26:16.18
in the Marine Corps because of legacy.

3672
02:26:16.18 --> 02:26:18.22
I thought that was kind of, I mean,

3673
02:26:18.22 --> 02:26:19.70
my dad scouted Major League Baseball.

3674
02:26:19.70 --> 02:26:22.14
Do I get in just because of the legacy?

3675
02:26:22.14 --> 02:26:22.98
You know what I mean?

3676
02:26:22.98 --> 02:26:25.94
Like that shouldn't, that was a little bit disappointing

3677
02:26:25.94 --> 02:26:26.78
to see that I mean-

3678
02:26:26.78 --> 02:26:27.94
Yeah, that should not play a role.

3679
02:26:27.94 --> 02:26:28.98
It should play a role.

3680
02:26:28.98 --> 02:26:30.70
If anything, they should be harder on him.

3681
02:26:30.70 --> 02:26:31.62
You would think.

3682
02:26:32.50 --> 02:26:35.18
Yeah, so, but other than that, you know,

3683
02:26:35.18 --> 02:26:37.82
I got the coolest thing happened to me when I was there.

3684
02:26:37.82 --> 02:26:39.58
I was coming out of football practice.

3685
02:26:39.58 --> 02:26:43.42
It was a class of 2000, year of 2005.

3686
02:26:43.42 --> 02:26:45.26
And a couple of the football players are like,

3687
02:26:45.26 --> 02:26:46.26
hey, they were like, Gunny,

3688
02:26:46.26 --> 02:26:48.26
hey man, you're going to graduate with us.

3689
02:26:49.22 --> 02:26:51.46
I said, what do you mean I'm not going to graduate?

3690
02:26:51.46 --> 02:26:53.34
In like physical fitness, you know what I mean?

3691
02:26:53.34 --> 02:26:55.34
Like they're giving me a PE award and stuff.

3692
02:26:55.34 --> 02:26:58.34
He's like, nope, we voted you to be our honorary graduate

3693
02:26:58.34 --> 02:27:00.94
and graduate with the class of 2005.

3694
02:27:00.94 --> 02:27:05.38
And it's voted by the midshipman, which was like,

3695
02:27:05.38 --> 02:27:08.14
that's the coolest thing I've ever-

3696
02:27:08.14 --> 02:27:10.50
What kind of people do they normally vote for that?

3697
02:27:10.50 --> 02:27:11.50
Not Gunnies.

3698
02:27:11.50 --> 02:27:13.02
You know what I mean?

3699
02:27:13.02 --> 02:27:14.86
Like I did a little bit of like,

3700
02:27:14.86 --> 02:27:18.86
it's normally like some professor or some other officer.

3701
02:27:18.86 --> 02:27:20.22
You know what I mean?

3702
02:27:20.22 --> 02:27:22.02
Kind of of a thing.

3703
02:27:22.02 --> 02:27:23.98
So your class of 2005.

3704
02:27:23.98 --> 02:27:25.34
Class of 2005.

3705
02:27:25.34 --> 02:27:26.18
Love him.

3706
02:27:26.18 --> 02:27:27.02
Yeah.

3707
02:27:27.02 --> 02:27:29.26
I just went to a Marine Corps ball

3708
02:27:29.26 --> 02:27:31.34
with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Horne.

3709
02:27:31.34 --> 02:27:33.98
He's got a 53 squadron down at Cherry Point.

3710
02:27:33.98 --> 02:27:37.06
And when he became the squadron CEO, he called me

3711
02:27:37.06 --> 02:27:39.58
and he's like, hey, JD, I want you to be

3712
02:27:39.58 --> 02:27:41.82
the guest speaker at our ball.

3713
02:27:41.82 --> 02:27:42.66
I'm like, you know what I mean?

3714
02:27:42.66 --> 02:27:43.94
He goes, I'm finally in charge

3715
02:27:43.94 --> 02:27:45.54
and I get to pick the guy coming.

3716
02:27:45.54 --> 02:27:48.10
And I was like, dude, I was never like in the air wing.

3717
02:27:48.10 --> 02:27:49.38
Don't give two shits.

3718
02:27:49.38 --> 02:27:50.38
You're coming.

3719
02:27:50.38 --> 02:27:52.18
He goes, cause you know, and when I was down there

3720
02:27:52.18 --> 02:27:53.42
with him, I mean, it came for, he's like,

3721
02:27:53.42 --> 02:27:55.50
I joined the Marines because of this guy.

3722
02:27:56.62 --> 02:27:58.74
You know, and it was great for one,

3723
02:27:58.74 --> 02:28:01.06
for the enlisted Marines that were in his squadron

3724
02:28:01.06 --> 02:28:04.22
to see an enlisted Marine having a relationship

3725
02:28:04.22 --> 02:28:07.14
with their CEO that like, that we could be friends, man.

3726
02:28:07.14 --> 02:28:08.70
Like we're on the same team.

3727
02:28:08.70 --> 02:28:12.42
Like, you know, it's a great organization

3728
02:28:12.42 --> 02:28:14.14
and great to be a part of.

3729
02:28:14.14 --> 02:28:18.06
And then after that, I got accepted into the alumni

3730
02:28:18.06 --> 02:28:19.10
with the Naval Academy.

3731
02:28:19.10 --> 02:28:21.26
They allowed me in the alumni.

3732
02:28:21.26 --> 02:28:24.94
So I'm an alumnus with the Quantico chapter.

3733
02:28:25.66 --> 02:28:26.50
Yeah, which is-

3734
02:28:26.50 --> 02:28:28.06
You like a ring knocker.

3735
02:28:28.06 --> 02:28:29.42
Did you get a ring?

3736
02:28:29.42 --> 02:28:30.26
No, I didn't.

3737
02:28:30.26 --> 02:28:31.18
Well, I got three of them.

3738
02:28:31.18 --> 02:28:34.50
I got three bowl rings with the football team.

3739
02:28:34.50 --> 02:28:36.18
Yeah, I did that.

3740
02:28:36.18 --> 02:28:38.42
I'm really not a ring guy.

3741
02:28:38.42 --> 02:28:39.98
I had thought about it.

3742
02:28:39.98 --> 02:28:41.82
You know, some of the folks at the academy were like,

3743
02:28:41.82 --> 02:28:44.22
yeah, man, we gotta get gunny a ring.

3744
02:28:44.22 --> 02:28:46.06
You know what I mean?

3745
02:28:46.06 --> 02:28:49.10
But I tell you what, that experience

3746
02:28:49.10 --> 02:28:52.66
at the Naval Academy, I mean, was phenomenal.

3747
02:28:53.58 --> 02:28:54.50
I can't say enough.

3748
02:28:54.50 --> 02:28:58.66
I mean, every organization has problems.

3749
02:28:58.66 --> 02:29:02.14
But for what those midshipmen do and for what they give,

3750
02:29:02.14 --> 02:29:04.46
you know, they're getting a four year education

3751
02:29:04.46 --> 02:29:06.70
and the service that they give back

3752
02:29:06.70 --> 02:29:09.46
and some of the shit they gotta put up with up there.

3753
02:29:09.46 --> 02:29:10.30
Hands are good to say.

3754
02:29:10.30 --> 02:29:12.86
They make them pay for that for the education out there.

3755
02:29:12.86 --> 02:29:14.22
Yeah, they're paying for it.

3756
02:29:14.22 --> 02:29:18.06
But they're like, I mean, they are quality Americans.

3757
02:29:18.06 --> 02:29:21.06
And that's all the service academies, I would say.

3758
02:29:21.06 --> 02:29:24.18
I mean, they're just a great group of individuals.

3759
02:29:24.18 --> 02:29:27.98
And I mean, I had a complete ball at the academy.

3760
02:29:27.98 --> 02:29:29.42
Yeah, no, it's it.

3761
02:29:29.42 --> 02:29:31.66
I've gone to West Point and talked to them.

3762
02:29:31.66 --> 02:29:33.30
I've gone to the Air Force Academy and talked to them.

3763
02:29:33.30 --> 02:29:37.34
It's just, yeah, very cool, very cool thing to look at.

3764
02:29:37.34 --> 02:29:39.34
What happened with the special mission unit

3765
02:29:39.34 --> 02:29:41.46
you were gonna select for?

3766
02:29:41.46 --> 02:29:46.46
Well, that in 2003, so they have what they call,

3767
02:29:47.98 --> 02:29:51.46
it's a leather neck program where they take the midshipmen

3768
02:29:51.46 --> 02:29:54.14
that want to select Marine Corps.

3769
02:29:54.14 --> 02:29:56.86
Their junior year, they take them to Quantico.

3770
02:29:56.86 --> 02:29:58.46
Because, give them a little taste.

3771
02:29:58.46 --> 02:30:01.82
Yeah, because they're the only, like the Naval Academy

3772
02:30:01.82 --> 02:30:06.82
doesn't have to go to OCS, which call it what you see,

3773
02:30:06.86 --> 02:30:10.02
but that is a little bit of contention.

3774
02:30:10.02 --> 02:30:14.62
I mean, OCS, I think they say,

3775
02:30:14.62 --> 02:30:15.94
oh, well, we went to Plebe Summer.

3776
02:30:15.94 --> 02:30:16.78
Well, guess what?

3777
02:30:16.78 --> 02:30:20.50
Plebe Summer is not Marine Corps Officer Candidate School.

3778
02:30:20.50 --> 02:30:23.10
Yeah, as you know, it's not even Naval Officer Candidate

3779
02:30:23.10 --> 02:30:23.94
School.

3780
02:30:23.94 --> 02:30:25.86
I don't know, I mean, I don't know.

3781
02:30:25.86 --> 02:30:26.70
Yeah.

3782
02:30:26.70 --> 02:30:27.54
I don't know.

3783
02:30:27.54 --> 02:30:28.38
You said I know, I don't know.

3784
02:30:28.38 --> 02:30:31.26
I know that Marine Corps OCS, or sorry, Navy OCS

3785
02:30:31.26 --> 02:30:34.66
was cool and good indoctrination for me.

3786
02:30:34.66 --> 02:30:36.98
I don't know how it compares to Plebe Summer or whatever.

3787
02:30:36.98 --> 02:30:37.82
I don't know.

3788
02:30:37.82 --> 02:30:39.10
But I'll take your word for it if you say

3789
02:30:39.10 --> 02:30:40.34
it's not quite the same thing.

3790
02:30:40.34 --> 02:30:42.02
Yeah, it's...

3791
02:30:42.02 --> 02:30:43.66
I can tell you, I'd rather go through OCS

3792
02:30:43.66 --> 02:30:45.42
than four years in the Naval Academy

3793
02:30:45.42 --> 02:30:47.66
as far as just like grind.

3794
02:30:47.66 --> 02:30:49.10
Yeah, any day of the week.

3795
02:30:50.46 --> 02:30:54.02
So like the Marine OCS, so it's just like with anything else.

3796
02:30:54.02 --> 02:30:56.42
They're gonna show up at TBS and,

3797
02:30:56.42 --> 02:30:59.94
oh, I had to go through OCS and you guys didn't

3798
02:30:59.94 --> 02:31:01.06
have to go through OCS.

3799
02:31:01.06 --> 02:31:05.02
There was a lot of midshipmen that wanted to go through OCS

3800
02:31:05.02 --> 02:31:06.90
because they had heard, you know what I mean?

3801
02:31:06.90 --> 02:31:08.58
And I was just like, look guys, you know what I mean?

3802
02:31:08.58 --> 02:31:10.30
So you don't go through OCS.

3803
02:31:10.30 --> 02:31:11.50
What the shit?

3804
02:31:11.50 --> 02:31:12.34
Yeah, you know what I mean?

3805
02:31:12.34 --> 02:31:13.94
You've had four years at the Academy.

3806
02:31:13.94 --> 02:31:15.46
Some of the folks that do go to OCS,

3807
02:31:15.46 --> 02:31:16.94
they went to a regular college.

3808
02:31:16.94 --> 02:31:18.78
They didn't have to put up with a lot of the crap

3809
02:31:18.78 --> 02:31:20.98
that you guys are having to put up with

3810
02:31:20.98 --> 02:31:22.22
while you're here.

3811
02:31:22.22 --> 02:31:23.98
You know, you had to do summer cruises.

3812
02:31:23.98 --> 02:31:27.02
You're competing for the ability to be a Marine officer,

3813
02:31:27.02 --> 02:31:28.46
which is pretty cool.

3814
02:31:28.46 --> 02:31:30.22
So we take them down to TBS

3815
02:31:30.22 --> 02:31:31.62
and they call it Leatherneck.

3816
02:31:31.62 --> 02:31:33.46
We call it purging the squid.

3817
02:31:34.42 --> 02:31:35.38
Just because, you know, I mean,

3818
02:31:35.38 --> 02:31:36.50
the Naval Academy is set up

3819
02:31:36.50 --> 02:31:38.26
as a surface warfare officer school.

3820
02:31:38.26 --> 02:31:39.58
I mean, that's what it is.

3821
02:31:39.58 --> 02:31:42.18
You're making surface warfare officers.

3822
02:31:42.18 --> 02:31:44.22
And there's no Marines in the brochure.

3823
02:31:44.22 --> 02:31:47.10
So we take them down there and we put them through

3824
02:31:47.10 --> 02:31:49.54
a little bit of the land navigation,

3825
02:31:49.54 --> 02:31:51.10
a little bit of the field skills stuff,

3826
02:31:51.10 --> 02:31:54.06
a little bit of the fire team and squad patrolling

3827
02:31:54.06 --> 02:31:54.90
kind of thing.

3828
02:31:54.90 --> 02:31:57.50
And then they've got Marine officers

3829
02:31:57.50 --> 02:31:58.78
and they've got second lieutenants

3830
02:31:58.78 --> 02:32:02.30
that just graduated TBS that work with the midshipmen.

3831
02:32:02.30 --> 02:32:05.02
And they do evaluations on some of these kids

3832
02:32:05.02 --> 02:32:08.14
to see how well they play with others.

3833
02:32:08.14 --> 02:32:08.98
You know what I mean?

3834
02:32:08.98 --> 02:32:09.82
How serious they are.

3835
02:32:09.82 --> 02:32:11.58
How long is Leatherneck program?

3836
02:32:11.58 --> 02:32:13.78
Leatherneck is, man, that's a good question.

3837
02:32:13.78 --> 02:32:17.22
I might be like four to six weeks.

3838
02:32:17.22 --> 02:32:19.34
It's really not that long.

3839
02:32:19.34 --> 02:32:21.94
But neither is OCS.

3840
02:32:23.30 --> 02:32:25.66
So they come down and they run through

3841
02:32:25.66 --> 02:32:27.02
the Leatherneck program.

3842
02:32:27.02 --> 02:32:30.74
And I got sent down to Quantico.

3843
02:32:34.10 --> 02:32:35.74
At first there was a lot of content.

3844
02:32:35.74 --> 02:32:37.50
Because people were like, oh, you got to do Pleep Summer.

3845
02:32:37.50 --> 02:32:39.30
Everybody comes here, you got to do Pleep Summer.

3846
02:32:39.30 --> 02:32:41.06
And I was like, well, General Allen said

3847
02:32:41.06 --> 02:32:42.38
I didn't have to do Pleep Summer.

3848
02:32:42.38 --> 02:32:43.42
And I'm going down to Quantico.

3849
02:32:43.42 --> 02:32:45.46
What, just go watch Pleep Summer basically?

3850
02:32:45.46 --> 02:32:46.30
Or monitor it?

3851
02:32:46.30 --> 02:32:47.54
Yeah, like monitor at work.

3852
02:32:47.54 --> 02:32:48.82
It is a senior enlisted.

3853
02:32:48.82 --> 02:32:49.66
You know what I mean?

3854
02:32:49.66 --> 02:32:51.42
It's kind of like indoctrination

3855
02:32:51.42 --> 02:32:52.94
of being a senior enlisted.

3856
02:32:54.38 --> 02:32:56.70
There was some cool guys that were up there at the academy.

3857
02:32:56.70 --> 02:33:00.86
But I really wasn't into the whole chief's mess

3858
02:33:00.86 --> 02:33:01.70
kind of thing.

3859
02:33:01.70 --> 02:33:03.30
Like I didn't want to go downtown inapolis

3860
02:33:03.30 --> 02:33:05.94
and do a pub crawl and that kind of stuff.

3861
02:33:08.02 --> 02:33:11.02
So I didn't mix well with some of the other.

3862
02:33:11.02 --> 02:33:12.90
I got along with a lot of the folks fine.

3863
02:33:12.90 --> 02:33:16.78
I just, I didn't mix as well with a lot of the others.

3864
02:33:16.78 --> 02:33:19.34
Some of them had that us versus them mentality.

3865
02:33:19.34 --> 02:33:20.18
Us.

3866
02:33:20.18 --> 02:33:24.02
Like us, the Covenant staff versus the midshipment.

3867
02:33:24.02 --> 02:33:26.78
Let's sit around and see how much we can like make

3868
02:33:26.78 --> 02:33:27.62
is miserable.

3869
02:33:27.62 --> 02:33:30.54
Like dude, these kids got it miserable enough, man.

3870
02:33:30.54 --> 02:33:31.58
And they're here.

3871
02:33:31.58 --> 02:33:33.70
And just because they're coming to the academy.

3872
02:33:33.70 --> 02:33:35.38
And yeah, it's a good gig.

3873
02:33:35.38 --> 02:33:38.70
I mean, they get a lot of cool stuff at the academy.

3874
02:33:38.70 --> 02:33:41.06
You know, they got like a silver spoon coming out

3875
02:33:41.06 --> 02:33:43.38
of every orifice of their body.

3876
02:33:43.38 --> 02:33:45.30
I mean, you know, who else gets to go on like summer

3877
02:33:45.30 --> 02:33:48.02
camping trips and you get to go with like an air wing unit.

3878
02:33:48.02 --> 02:33:49.18
You get to fly over.

3879
02:33:49.18 --> 02:33:52.18
I mean, they do some cool stuff at the academy.

3880
02:33:52.18 --> 02:33:54.30
And I think it's just jealousy of, you know,

3881
02:33:54.30 --> 02:33:57.74
there's a lot of chiefs, gunnies, or, you know,

3882
02:33:57.74 --> 02:34:00.78
they didn't get that opportunity and they just want to stick it

3883
02:34:00.78 --> 02:34:02.66
to the midshipment as much as they can.

3884
02:34:02.66 --> 02:34:06.70
And, you know, and like, like what they call like fry in them.

3885
02:34:06.70 --> 02:34:10.10
Like basically like a NJP, but not NJP.

3886
02:34:10.10 --> 02:34:11.66
They call it a fry.

3887
02:34:11.66 --> 02:34:13.06
Well, all that's going to do to that kid.

3888
02:34:13.06 --> 02:34:14.62
I mean, so the kid did something stupid.

3889
02:34:14.62 --> 02:34:16.14
I mean, they're kids.

3890
02:34:16.14 --> 02:34:19.02
That's going to hurt their order of merit.

3891
02:34:19.02 --> 02:34:19.86
You know what I mean?

3892
02:34:19.86 --> 02:34:22.34
Like unless they're doing something like grievous, you know what

3893
02:34:22.34 --> 02:34:22.66
I mean?

3894
02:34:22.66 --> 02:34:24.50
Like, like, come on, man.

3895
02:34:24.50 --> 02:34:27.34
Like, you know, the kid was, you know, he's a kid.

3896
02:34:27.34 --> 02:34:30.98
A lot of times I think some of the folks forget that that,

3897
02:34:30.98 --> 02:34:35.38
you know, they didn't want to see JD when he was 18 and 19.

3898
02:34:35.38 --> 02:34:39.10
And so, you know, those kind of folks, those us versus them

3899
02:34:39.10 --> 02:34:42.90
mentality of, of with the midshipment.

3900
02:34:42.90 --> 02:34:46.50
And I tell you what, the midshipment, they made my experience

3901
02:34:46.50 --> 02:34:48.42
at the academy enjoyable.

3902
02:34:48.42 --> 02:34:52.06
If it wasn't for them, it wouldn't have been as fun.

3903
02:34:52.06 --> 02:34:53.10
Like I had a ball.

3904
02:34:53.10 --> 02:34:56.06
So I ended up down at Leatherneck for the summer and they were

3905
02:34:56.06 --> 02:34:59.98
going out to do simulations and, you know, CQB stuff, you know,

3906
02:34:59.98 --> 02:35:02.98
coming in doing mouth at the mouth facility there.

3907
02:35:02.98 --> 02:35:07.46
And, you know, a couple of the guys, the XO that was in charge,

3908
02:35:07.46 --> 02:35:10.90
the major that was down there, his callsign was Pedro.

3909
02:35:10.90 --> 02:35:14.58
He was a pilot, great guy, major Brown.

3910
02:35:14.58 --> 02:35:16.82
And he's like, hey, why don't you come out, man, and play

3911
02:35:16.82 --> 02:35:19.10
simulations with the midshipment while they're kind of taking

3912
02:35:19.10 --> 02:35:19.94
them through the mouth.

3913
02:35:19.94 --> 02:35:21.98
So I was like, yeah, I'm there.

3914
02:35:21.98 --> 02:35:24.18
Like I love doing simulations in mouth.

3915
02:35:24.18 --> 02:35:25.06
I mean, it's fun.

3916
02:35:25.06 --> 02:35:25.82
You know what I mean?

3917
02:35:25.82 --> 02:35:26.50
Yeah.

3918
02:35:26.50 --> 02:35:30.62
And so we're up there and I ended up getting up in the third

3919
02:35:30.62 --> 02:35:34.38
story and one of the rafters in one of the buildings and I'm

3920
02:35:34.38 --> 02:35:38.14
making my way through the rafters, having a ball,

3921
02:35:38.14 --> 02:35:39.50
shooting midshipment.

3922
02:35:39.50 --> 02:35:40.42
Sniper.

3923
02:35:40.42 --> 02:35:40.86
Yeah.

3924
02:35:40.86 --> 02:35:42.58
I mean, just, and I'm slick.

3925
02:35:42.58 --> 02:35:44.22
So I got no helmet on.

3926
02:35:44.22 --> 02:35:45.38
Yeah, I got nothing.

3927
02:35:45.38 --> 02:35:46.70
I'm just, I'm having a ball.

3928
02:35:46.70 --> 02:35:49.70
It's a great day.

3929
02:35:49.70 --> 02:35:52.26
And then beams break.

3930
02:35:52.26 --> 02:35:55.62
I came out of the third story, fell three stories,

3931
02:35:55.62 --> 02:35:59.58
and just hit like a second.

3932
02:35:59.58 --> 02:36:02.82
You mean the beams break of the rafters that you're in?

3933
02:36:02.82 --> 02:36:03.14
Yeah.

3934
02:36:03.14 --> 02:36:06.38
You know how like the rafters are, when you go back and look

3935
02:36:06.38 --> 02:36:08.82
at the rafters, they were, you know, it's government.

3936
02:36:08.82 --> 02:36:11.50
They were just put in with like long stables.

3937
02:36:11.50 --> 02:36:15.74
So the rafters weren't, but necessarily like for me to get,

3938
02:36:15.74 --> 02:36:19.02
they were kind of like, how did they even get in the rafters?

3939
02:36:19.02 --> 02:36:20.90
Because like when you went to the third story,

3940
02:36:20.90 --> 02:36:23.02
there was just like a cutout.

3941
02:36:23.02 --> 02:36:25.98
Like, you know, you got like a fake ceiling.

3942
02:36:25.98 --> 02:36:27.74
Like a fake ceiling with the little cutout,

3943
02:36:27.74 --> 02:36:30.10
like you have in some people's garages, you know what I mean?

3944
02:36:30.10 --> 02:36:32.54
And you can push up and put a ladder in and put storage.

3945
02:36:32.54 --> 02:36:35.58
So I just ran and hit the wall, jumped up, grabbed,

3946
02:36:35.58 --> 02:36:37.90
pulled myself up and got up into the rafters.

3947
02:36:37.90 --> 02:36:38.50
You know what I mean?

3948
02:36:38.50 --> 02:36:40.18
So yeah, I got up there.

3949
02:36:40.18 --> 02:36:42.30
And then once I was up in there, I was coming out

3950
02:36:42.30 --> 02:36:44.42
and turkey peaking, trying to figure out where the midshipmen

3951
02:36:44.42 --> 02:36:46.98
were moving around in the town and put my hand down.

3952
02:36:46.98 --> 02:36:50.98
Boom, God rafters came out and I came down three stories.

3953
02:36:50.98 --> 02:36:54.46
How come you went down three stories and not just falling from?

3954
02:36:54.46 --> 02:36:56.94
Because you know how like the mount has like a building that

3955
02:36:56.94 --> 02:36:58.66
looks like it's blown off?

3956
02:36:58.66 --> 02:36:59.38
Yeah.

3957
02:36:59.38 --> 02:36:59.66
Yeah.

3958
02:36:59.66 --> 02:37:01.02
So there was nothing there.

3959
02:37:01.02 --> 02:37:01.94
Oh, OK.

3960
02:37:01.94 --> 02:37:05.54
So I'm out.

3961
02:37:05.54 --> 02:37:10.06
And yeah, hit went down the hit with the left shoulder

3962
02:37:10.06 --> 02:37:12.98
and then just down the left side of the body.

3963
02:37:12.98 --> 02:37:17.30
So just and the bad thing was I didn't knock myself out.

3964
02:37:17.30 --> 02:37:20.46
So I mean, you know, like when you go see the doc and they're

3965
02:37:20.46 --> 02:37:23.30
like, so on a pain scale of one to 10, like where I was like,

3966
02:37:23.30 --> 02:37:25.14
dude, yeah, this is a 10.

3967
02:37:25.14 --> 02:37:28.06
Like, yes, it hurt.

3968
02:37:28.06 --> 02:37:33.22
And they medivac me out and took me in and I shattered my left

3969
02:37:33.22 --> 02:37:37.86
shoulder, broke a couple of ribs on the left side,

3970
02:37:37.86 --> 02:37:43.22
broke my pelvis in three spots and the left ankle.

3971
02:37:43.22 --> 02:37:48.70
And yeah, it was going from a hundred mile an hour to zero

3972
02:37:48.70 --> 02:37:51.86
and in an instant.

3973
02:37:51.86 --> 02:37:57.42
And it ended up in a wheelchair, which was that.

3974
02:37:57.42 --> 02:37:58.78
That put a lot of stuff.

3975
02:37:58.78 --> 02:38:03.10
Like I didn't like being in a wheelchair like, man, that.

3976
02:38:03.10 --> 02:38:04.74
That was terrible.

3977
02:38:04.74 --> 02:38:09.86
I mean, I was, I was coming on glued.

3978
02:38:09.86 --> 02:38:12.58
Yeah, it was just, it was a bad, a bad time.

3979
02:38:12.58 --> 02:38:14.46
You know, I didn't want to hear the whole, oh, everything

3980
02:38:14.46 --> 02:38:15.98
happens for a reason kind of thing.

3981
02:38:15.98 --> 02:38:20.50
Like that wasn't flying with me at the time.

3982
02:38:20.50 --> 02:38:24.14
Just because I thought that, you know, something that I was

3983
02:38:24.14 --> 02:38:29.02
hoping to do that fall was now gone.

3984
02:38:29.02 --> 02:38:31.70
And then, you know, the Navy docs that are taking care of me,

3985
02:38:31.70 --> 02:38:33.34
you know, they were, they were kind of great guys,

3986
02:38:33.34 --> 02:38:39.78
but one of the Navy doctors, commander, you know, he was like,

3987
02:38:39.78 --> 02:38:42.18
yeah, I don't, I don't know if you, you know, you're running

3988
02:38:42.18 --> 02:38:46.70
and that kind of thing, that that's going to be happening.

3989
02:38:46.70 --> 02:38:51.22
And I didn't like that of telling me that that's not going

3990
02:38:51.22 --> 02:38:51.62
to happen.

3991
02:38:51.62 --> 02:38:55.58
So I went in and at Walter Reed, they redid my shoulder the

3992
02:38:55.58 --> 02:38:58.34
first time and I had to get like a bone graph and stuff put

3993
02:38:58.34 --> 02:39:01.18
in and, and some screws.

3994
02:39:01.18 --> 02:39:03.30
So I get that done at Walter Reed, which that was back,

3995
02:39:03.30 --> 02:39:06.10
then when it was like a dungeon, you know, when, before it hit

3996
02:39:06.10 --> 02:39:12.34
the news of how stuff went down, I come out of there and this

3997
02:39:12.34 --> 02:39:18.26
happened in the summer of 2003 and January of 2004.

3998
02:39:18.26 --> 02:39:21.98
I signed up and went with the Navy team to run the Disney

3999
02:39:21.98 --> 02:39:26.58
marathon because I was like, yeah, I'm, I'm running.

4000
02:39:26.58 --> 02:39:31.94
I had already been running being at the Naval Academy with

4001
02:39:31.94 --> 02:39:34.66
their athletic department and the trainers and stuff that

4002
02:39:34.66 --> 02:39:39.02
they had, man, they had me like Aqua jogging and resistance

4003
02:39:39.02 --> 02:39:40.54
stuff, you know what I mean?

4004
02:39:40.54 --> 02:39:43.94
And, and the elliptical and, and there was some, you know,

4005
02:39:43.94 --> 02:39:46.38
some of the guys would come in because like Aqua jogging is

4006
02:39:46.38 --> 02:39:47.34
boring as shit.

4007
02:39:47.34 --> 02:39:47.90
You know what I mean?

4008
02:39:47.90 --> 02:39:50.94
Like it's boring, but I'd have guys come in and get in the

4009
02:39:50.94 --> 02:39:53.70
pool with me because I'm just trying to get back.

4010
02:39:53.70 --> 02:39:56.18
I'm still focused like, hey, I still got a shot.

4011
02:39:56.18 --> 02:39:56.86
You know what I mean?

4012
02:39:56.86 --> 02:39:59.94
I can get better.

4013
02:39:59.94 --> 02:40:03.26
So, you know, that happened in June, the summer and January.

4014
02:40:03.26 --> 02:40:09.42
I went down and I ran a 319 Disney, not my best time, but

4015
02:40:09.42 --> 02:40:13.70
I was, I was pretty stoked with a 319 and I came back with

4016
02:40:13.70 --> 02:40:16.70
that big stupid Disney medal that they give you.

4017
02:40:16.70 --> 02:40:19.70
I threw it on the commander's desk and I was like, there's

4018
02:40:19.70 --> 02:40:21.50
your fucking PhD.

4019
02:40:21.50 --> 02:40:23.26
Don't tell me I can't run.

4020
02:40:23.26 --> 02:40:26.82
And of course that's going against doctors or orders kind

4021
02:40:26.82 --> 02:40:31.30
of a thing. They got me a new doc, the new doc that I got.

4022
02:40:31.30 --> 02:40:32.82
He was great.

4023
02:40:32.82 --> 02:40:34.30
He was like, yeah, push your body.

4024
02:40:34.30 --> 02:40:37.30
You know, the human body is an amazing machine.

4025
02:40:37.30 --> 02:40:38.94
You can, you know, get yourself back.

4026
02:40:38.94 --> 02:40:40.74
You get yourself fit.

4027
02:40:40.74 --> 02:40:43.54
So I started next back in the pool swimming.

4028
02:40:43.54 --> 02:40:44.30
I was over there.

4029
02:40:44.30 --> 02:40:47.02
You know, the men's swim team was phenomenal.

4030
02:40:47.02 --> 02:40:49.34
Navy, they got a really good swim program there and the

4031
02:40:49.34 --> 02:40:50.10
coach was great.

4032
02:40:50.10 --> 02:40:53.38
So I used to like to go in and swim with the team and I was

4033
02:40:53.38 --> 02:40:53.90
in there swimming.

4034
02:40:53.90 --> 02:40:56.82
I got out of the shower one day and I was, as I was like

4035
02:40:56.82 --> 02:40:59.10
showering on my shoulder, like something was coming out the

4036
02:40:59.10 --> 02:41:00.10
back of my shoulder.

4037
02:41:00.10 --> 02:41:02.10
Well, so I go over to the football locker.

4038
02:41:02.10 --> 02:41:03.14
They put the X right on.

4039
02:41:03.14 --> 02:41:06.90
I got screws coming out back to the hospital.

4040
02:41:06.90 --> 02:41:07.38
You know what I mean?

4041
02:41:07.38 --> 02:41:11.02
My body was refusing some of the screws coming in.

4042
02:41:11.02 --> 02:41:16.54
I went through rehab with that for the second shoulder

4043
02:41:16.54 --> 02:41:21.06
operation and General Allen, he was kind of my sponsor.

4044
02:41:21.06 --> 02:41:22.06
He had been moved on.

4045
02:41:22.06 --> 02:41:25.22
He was up at the Pentagon. He's a one star up to Pentagon.

4046
02:41:25.22 --> 02:41:27.70
And finally, you know, John Allen called me up to the

4047
02:41:27.70 --> 02:41:30.34
Pentagon and he's like, because they put me up on a

4048
02:41:30.34 --> 02:41:32.30
Navy board, Med.

4049
02:41:32.30 --> 02:41:37.74
And I went up and, you know, John was like, where, where do

4050
02:41:37.74 --> 02:41:39.78
you want to go?

4051
02:41:39.78 --> 02:41:41.90
Because you're not, you're done.

4052
02:41:41.90 --> 02:41:44.54
Like you're not, they were not going to pass you on any kind

4053
02:41:44.54 --> 02:41:48.94
of jump physical, nothing, you know, make map.

4054
02:41:48.94 --> 02:41:51.38
You know, even the shoulder had gotten bad enough to where

4055
02:41:51.38 --> 02:41:53.74
they were like, dude, you keep monkeying around like you're

4056
02:41:53.74 --> 02:41:56.82
going to lose mobility.

4057
02:41:56.82 --> 02:42:00.86
So that kind of got the realism in there.

4058
02:42:00.86 --> 02:42:03.70
And, you know, with him, I was hanging out at the academy

4059
02:42:03.70 --> 02:42:09.02
and the next thing, you know, I got a call from the monitor.

4060
02:42:09.02 --> 02:42:11.82
Medi Knox called me and I was actually at a bowl game in

4061
02:42:11.82 --> 02:42:14.50
San Diego here with the Navy football and he called me and

4062
02:42:14.50 --> 02:42:16.38
he's like, hey, JD, we'd like you to come back down to

4063
02:42:16.38 --> 02:42:20.94
Quantico and, you know, oversee the schools because they had

4064
02:42:20.94 --> 02:42:23.46
Sniper School, HRP, high rest personnel.

4065
02:42:23.46 --> 02:42:28.94
It's basically pistol shooting and Savina Tire, small arms

4066
02:42:28.94 --> 02:42:31.30
weapon instructor course in preacher school.

4067
02:42:31.30 --> 02:42:33.78
So they asked me if I'd come back down and I was literally

4068
02:42:33.78 --> 02:42:36.70
sitting right downtown San Diego and I'm like, dude, I'm in a

4069
02:42:36.70 --> 02:42:39.46
bowl game with Navy football right now.

4070
02:42:39.46 --> 02:42:41.70
You want me to come back?

4071
02:42:41.70 --> 02:42:43.38
I don't want to come back.

4072
02:42:43.38 --> 02:42:45.98
So I was like, hey, I'll call you when I get done.

4073
02:42:45.98 --> 02:42:50.90
Out here, I came back and Medi Knox gave me my sergeant.

4074
02:42:50.90 --> 02:42:54.46
He promoted me, gave me a pin up and pinned me on February

4075
02:42:54.46 --> 02:42:58.26
1st and I went back down to Quantico and gave him a couple

4076
02:42:58.26 --> 02:43:02.58
more years back down at the schoolhouse as a mass sergeant

4077
02:43:02.58 --> 02:43:06.18
and then left at 21.

4078
02:43:06.18 --> 02:43:11.10
And I think it was good for me to be down there.

4079
02:43:11.10 --> 02:43:15.38
The colonel that I was working for is Mike Mulligan's gray guy

4080
02:43:15.38 --> 02:43:19.94
and Mike, you know, trying to get me ready for transition.

4081
02:43:19.94 --> 02:43:24.02
Like, I didn't know this was not the plan.

4082
02:43:24.02 --> 02:43:28.06
Yeah, I wanted to stay at camp as long as possible until I get

4083
02:43:28.06 --> 02:43:33.90
like 30 years and then retire or make all the way to E-9

4084
02:43:33.90 --> 02:43:34.98
because I was at E-8.

4085
02:43:34.98 --> 02:43:37.58
And yeah, it wasn't a plan.

4086
02:43:37.58 --> 02:43:43.70
So I really, I didn't know what I was going to do.

4087
02:43:43.70 --> 02:43:51.06
And probably the biggest aspect of my wife, Tracy,

4088
02:43:51.06 --> 02:43:54.42
at times she's like, you can do stuff.

4089
02:43:54.42 --> 02:43:55.86
I mean, it's one thing she'll give me.

4090
02:43:55.86 --> 02:43:57.74
She's like, you'll work.

4091
02:43:57.74 --> 02:43:59.06
You're going to show up.

4092
02:43:59.06 --> 02:44:00.66
You're going to work.

4093
02:44:00.66 --> 02:44:03.38
And one of the guys that had taught me back in the day

4094
02:44:03.38 --> 02:44:07.22
to cast my net widely, Eric Carlson, he called me

4095
02:44:07.22 --> 02:44:08.86
and was like, hey, man, do you want

4096
02:44:08.86 --> 02:44:12.94
to do some contract work with infantry weapons,

4097
02:44:12.94 --> 02:44:15.34
special weapons, sniper rifle, stuff like that,

4098
02:44:15.34 --> 02:44:18.06
you know, working for L3 communications.

4099
02:44:18.06 --> 02:44:20.70
So he called me and I was like, yeah, do I have to like,

4100
02:44:20.70 --> 02:44:21.98
you know, what do I have to do?

4101
02:44:21.98 --> 02:44:23.90
He goes, well, you know, we got to have like a panel interview

4102
02:44:23.90 --> 02:44:24.70
kind of thing.

4103
02:44:24.70 --> 02:44:28.42
And so I go out to see Eric and everybody that's on the panel.

4104
02:44:28.42 --> 02:44:29.90
I served with all of them in the Marine Corps.

4105
02:44:29.90 --> 02:44:31.74
It was like a going home kind of thing.

4106
02:44:31.74 --> 02:44:33.30
It was like, all these dudes are there.

4107
02:44:33.30 --> 02:44:35.62
And it's just, this is preliminary.

4108
02:44:35.62 --> 02:44:41.02
And so Eric, you know, brought me in and, I mean,

4109
02:44:41.02 --> 02:44:44.62
he took care of me, gave me a job.

4110
02:44:44.62 --> 02:44:49.30
Because again, I didn't really know what I was going to do.

4111
02:44:49.30 --> 02:44:51.30
So how long did you do that contracting job for?

4112
02:44:51.30 --> 02:44:52.46
A couple years.

4113
02:44:52.46 --> 02:44:56.98
And then what, how did you end up forming OMNA,

4114
02:44:56.98 --> 02:44:59.26
which is your, OMNA International,

4115
02:44:59.26 --> 02:45:02.66
which is your leadership company?

4116
02:45:02.66 --> 02:45:04.50
Is that the right thing to call it?

4117
02:45:04.50 --> 02:45:08.66
Yeah, yeah, well, it's experiential.

4118
02:45:08.66 --> 02:45:09.74
Right, experiential learning.

4119
02:45:09.74 --> 02:45:11.94
Experiential learning.

4120
02:45:11.94 --> 02:45:15.98
And so it was, it was at L3.

4121
02:45:15.98 --> 02:45:20.50
And, you know, in the Marine Corps, you know,

4122
02:45:20.50 --> 02:45:22.70
I had the opportunity because of some of the officers

4123
02:45:22.70 --> 02:45:25.66
that I served with that let me tag along and go on some staff

4124
02:45:25.66 --> 02:45:29.18
rides historically, which was like super, I mean, you know,

4125
02:45:29.18 --> 02:45:32.70
going to over and study in Okinawa, the battle over there

4126
02:45:32.70 --> 02:45:35.14
and seeing the reverse slope defense of the Japanese,

4127
02:45:35.14 --> 02:45:37.74
like what we kind of went through, the Philippines,

4128
02:45:37.74 --> 02:45:39.82
you know, the Korea, you know what I mean?

4129
02:45:39.82 --> 02:45:42.86
So just reading and then getting to go to these places

4130
02:45:42.86 --> 02:45:46.78
and actually stand on the exact spot where,

4131
02:45:46.78 --> 02:45:47.62
where folks have been.

4132
02:45:47.62 --> 02:45:50.74
And like I said, I had read quite a bit.

4133
02:45:50.74 --> 02:45:53.54
You know, I remember reading, you know, Hackworth

4134
02:45:53.54 --> 02:45:55.46
back in the day, you know, those kind of guys

4135
02:45:55.46 --> 02:46:00.46
were just very influential on me in leadership.

4136
02:46:00.46 --> 02:46:03.14
And it was just, you know, it was kind of like a,

4137
02:46:03.14 --> 02:46:08.14
an experience to where, you know, it's not in a classroom.

4138
02:46:08.14 --> 02:46:10.70
It's not you're actually on the field.

4139
02:46:10.70 --> 02:46:15.50
It's very hands-on kind of learning

4140
02:46:15.50 --> 02:46:17.50
and learning how to lead.

4141
02:46:17.50 --> 02:46:22.50
And so I started with Omna of,

4142
02:46:23.70 --> 02:46:28.54
it started to realize that we could do staff rides

4143
02:46:28.54 --> 02:46:33.54
outside of the Marine Corps.

4144
02:46:34.14 --> 02:46:37.14
Like there's a, there's, there's other organizations

4145
02:46:37.14 --> 02:46:41.66
that are out there, you know, like at the Naval Academy,

4146
02:46:41.66 --> 02:46:43.54
we used to take the kids to Antietam.

4147
02:46:43.54 --> 02:46:44.38
You know what I mean?

4148
02:46:44.38 --> 02:46:45.26
They could do it as a weekend trip.

4149
02:46:45.26 --> 02:46:46.22
We could take them to Antietam.

4150
02:46:46.22 --> 02:46:48.42
You know, John Allen, he was a big history guy,

4151
02:46:48.42 --> 02:46:51.14
Marine officer, of course, love staff rides.

4152
02:46:51.14 --> 02:46:54.18
You know, Gettysburg is another big one.

4153
02:46:54.18 --> 02:46:57.78
Corporal Seamus Garry used to live up in Gettysburg up there.

4154
02:46:57.78 --> 02:47:00.70
We called it Marine Barracks, Gettysburg.

4155
02:47:00.70 --> 02:47:01.54
You know what I mean?

4156
02:47:01.54 --> 02:47:03.18
So there was, you know, going to Gettysburg,

4157
02:47:03.18 --> 02:47:05.70
the experiential stuff of overseas, you know,

4158
02:47:05.70 --> 02:47:07.66
the Marine Corps was always big on this

4159
02:47:07.66 --> 02:47:12.18
with doing staff rides.

4160
02:47:12.18 --> 02:47:14.46
And they were a lot of fun.

4161
02:47:14.46 --> 02:47:18.18
So again, this same guy, Eric Carlson had been dealing

4162
02:47:18.18 --> 02:47:22.10
with the wildland firefighters,

4163
02:47:22.10 --> 02:47:25.06
the guys, hotshots, smoke jumpers, engine crew,

4164
02:47:25.06 --> 02:47:26.22
kind of guys.

4165
02:47:26.22 --> 02:47:29.74
And I guess they had had a couple of fatality fires.

4166
02:47:29.74 --> 02:47:33.54
So they did a tri-data study and they earmarked

4167
02:47:33.54 --> 02:47:36.22
and went around and looked at different organizations

4168
02:47:36.22 --> 02:47:38.82
of how they teach leadership.

4169
02:47:38.82 --> 02:47:41.46
And they ended up at Marine Corps University

4170
02:47:41.46 --> 02:47:45.58
and Eric Carlson was the operations officer.

4171
02:47:45.58 --> 02:47:49.70
And Eric, and they called over and Craig Huddleston,

4172
02:47:49.70 --> 02:47:51.14
who's with Omna as well.

4173
02:47:51.14 --> 02:47:53.82
Craig is another one of my great mentors.

4174
02:47:53.82 --> 02:47:58.34
Craig was over at Command and Staff.

4175
02:47:58.34 --> 02:48:00.62
And they were like, hey, do you mind if some firefighter guys

4176
02:48:00.62 --> 02:48:02.50
come tag along, go to Gettysburg?

4177
02:48:02.50 --> 02:48:04.30
Sure, rang them along.

4178
02:48:04.30 --> 02:48:05.78
So they went up to Gettysburg.

4179
02:48:05.78 --> 02:48:09.50
And when they saw how the Marine Corps just took a pile

4180
02:48:09.50 --> 02:48:11.78
of dirt of what we call a terrain model,

4181
02:48:11.78 --> 02:48:13.74
they were like, wow, this is pretty cheap.

4182
02:48:13.74 --> 02:48:15.66
We've got a lot of dirt.

4183
02:48:15.66 --> 02:48:18.86
And there were so many similarities between

4184
02:48:18.86 --> 02:48:21.82
wildland firefighting and the Marine Corps.

4185
02:48:21.82 --> 02:48:24.62
You know, a hotshot is an infantry platoon.

4186
02:48:24.62 --> 02:48:26.82
You know, an engine is like artillery.

4187
02:48:26.82 --> 02:48:28.98
They've got aviation, they've got logistics,

4188
02:48:28.98 --> 02:48:30.82
they've got, you know, incident commanders

4189
02:48:30.82 --> 02:48:33.42
and they were putting people in harm's way.

4190
02:48:33.42 --> 02:48:35.82
They're making plans, they're using terrain models

4191
02:48:35.82 --> 02:48:36.98
and they're sending folks out

4192
02:48:36.98 --> 02:48:39.10
just like on a military operation.

4193
02:48:39.10 --> 02:48:44.10
So they really bought into this staff ride concept

4194
02:48:44.10 --> 02:48:47.18
as well as the Naval Academy.

4195
02:48:47.18 --> 02:48:51.22
You know, so the Naval Academy with Joe Thomas

4196
02:48:51.22 --> 02:48:53.90
who's still up there with the leadership in ethics,

4197
02:48:53.90 --> 02:48:57.10
Gray Guy, retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel, Pennsylvania guy,

4198
02:48:57.10 --> 02:48:59.90
Joe and them, I mean, we've taken the Naval Academy

4199
02:48:59.90 --> 02:49:03.62
up to Gettysburg because the team captains

4200
02:49:03.62 --> 02:49:07.62
with the football and all the sports that were up there,

4201
02:49:07.62 --> 02:49:11.94
were like, hey, we got a guy that can take the team captains

4202
02:49:11.94 --> 02:49:13.78
and take them to Gettysburg.

4203
02:49:13.78 --> 02:49:16.14
So, you know, through NAAA,

4204
02:49:16.14 --> 02:49:18.06
I took the team captains up there

4205
02:49:18.06 --> 02:49:19.78
because you know, I knew a lot of the coaches

4206
02:49:19.78 --> 02:49:23.78
because obviously I spent a lot of time with their facilities.

4207
02:49:23.78 --> 02:49:24.62
You know what I mean?

4208
02:49:24.62 --> 02:49:26.94
Kind of playing around and I just started,

4209
02:49:26.94 --> 02:49:28.94
like at first it was kind of a,

4210
02:49:31.58 --> 02:49:33.78
kind of something fun to do,

4211
02:49:34.74 --> 02:49:38.18
but I didn't know how to run a business.

4212
02:49:38.18 --> 02:49:40.98
So I basically went online of,

4213
02:49:40.98 --> 02:49:42.78
because you can find everything online

4214
02:49:42.78 --> 02:49:45.94
and like, how do you start a business.com?

4215
02:49:45.94 --> 02:49:50.02
And then, okay, well, you gotta pick a name,

4216
02:49:50.02 --> 02:49:52.62
you gotta get a duns number, you gotta get a 10,

4217
02:49:52.62 --> 02:49:55.34
you gotta get, you know, so there was a lot of reading

4218
02:49:55.34 --> 02:49:59.02
involved because I had no clue,

4219
02:49:59.02 --> 02:50:01.38
like how do you get a business license?

4220
02:50:01.38 --> 02:50:04.02
I mean, it's just amazing, like,

4221
02:50:04.02 --> 02:50:09.02
I became so more educated, you know what I mean,

4222
02:50:09.10 --> 02:50:13.26
of just starting a business and getting QuickBooks.

4223
02:50:13.26 --> 02:50:14.66
Like, how do you do taxes?

4224
02:50:14.66 --> 02:50:16.06
How do you run payroll?

4225
02:50:16.06 --> 02:50:17.38
Like, how do you, you know what I mean?

4226
02:50:17.38 --> 02:50:18.86
Yeah, you wanna learn a lot of stuff,

4227
02:50:18.86 --> 02:50:20.70
start some businesses, start a business,

4228
02:50:20.70 --> 02:50:22.54
start with just one, you're gonna learn a lot.

4229
02:50:22.54 --> 02:50:24.58
Yeah, I've just got one.

4230
02:50:24.58 --> 02:50:26.58
Yeah, I know, yeah.

4231
02:50:27.78 --> 02:50:29.62
But even like, I think the, well,

4232
02:50:29.62 --> 02:50:31.78
I know the first business that I started

4233
02:50:31.78 --> 02:50:33.86
was this gym that we're in today

4234
02:50:33.86 --> 02:50:36.06
and just the amount of learning that you do.

4235
02:50:36.06 --> 02:50:37.74
And then, you know, your next business,

4236
02:50:37.74 --> 02:50:39.42
you already have some of those lessons learning,

4237
02:50:39.42 --> 02:50:41.50
you can apply them and then the next business after that,

4238
02:50:41.50 --> 02:50:43.38
when you can apply some more and yeah,

4239
02:50:43.38 --> 02:50:47.10
but if you're a young person or you just got out of,

4240
02:50:47.10 --> 02:50:50.02
you know, the service, you start a business.

4241
02:50:50.02 --> 02:50:51.78
I don't care if you do, you know,

4242
02:50:51.78 --> 02:50:54.46
you sell, you know, clothes pins or something,

4243
02:50:54.46 --> 02:50:55.42
painted clothes pins.

4244
02:50:55.42 --> 02:50:58.02
If you start a business, just sell painted clothes pins,

4245
02:50:58.02 --> 02:51:00.34
you're gonna learn a ton, you're gonna learn a ton.

4246
02:51:00.34 --> 02:51:02.14
And you might make some money along the way,

4247
02:51:02.14 --> 02:51:03.74
you might lose some money, but you're gonna learn a lot.

4248
02:51:03.74 --> 02:51:04.62
That's for sure.

4249
02:51:05.62 --> 02:51:08.38
And this is how you and I eventually linked up

4250
02:51:08.38 --> 02:51:11.50
because at Escalon Front, we wanted to do

4251
02:51:11.50 --> 02:51:12.86
what we call EF Battlefield

4252
02:51:12.86 --> 02:51:14.30
and we wanted to have, you know,

4253
02:51:14.30 --> 02:51:16.98
an expert that has more knowledge

4254
02:51:16.98 --> 02:51:19.02
about the battles than we do.

4255
02:51:19.02 --> 02:51:22.34
And that's how we linked up for the first time,

4256
02:51:22.34 --> 02:51:23.34
which was awesome.

4257
02:51:23.34 --> 02:51:26.74
Yeah, yeah, so we started out,

4258
02:51:26.74 --> 02:51:29.22
so I've had the company since 2010.

4259
02:51:30.38 --> 02:51:33.98
And Omna stands for one man national asset.

4260
02:51:35.74 --> 02:51:39.10
And I learned from Al Gray

4261
02:51:39.10 --> 02:51:42.14
that before you decide what you're gonna do,

4262
02:51:42.14 --> 02:51:44.14
decide who you're doing it with.

4263
02:51:45.42 --> 02:51:49.58
And, you know, Eric Carlson, the same guy,

4264
02:51:49.58 --> 02:51:52.90
I mean, he's, of course,

4265
02:51:52.90 --> 02:51:54.78
I'm gonna do everything with Eric Carlson.

4266
02:51:54.78 --> 02:51:57.02
I lived three quarters of a mile from Eric Carlson,

4267
02:51:57.02 --> 02:51:58.62
still to this day.

4268
02:51:58.62 --> 02:52:00.34
I run past his house in the morning.

4269
02:52:00.34 --> 02:52:02.78
I mean, he is a huge impact.

4270
02:52:02.78 --> 02:52:06.02
And now Craig Huddleston,

4271
02:52:06.02 --> 02:52:08.62
Craig Huddleston is the most interesting man in the world.

4272
02:52:08.62 --> 02:52:13.62
He went from E1 to E7 to 01 to 06.

4273
02:52:16.58 --> 02:52:17.66
A little over 33.

4274
02:52:17.66 --> 02:52:19.50
He was a drill instructor.

4275
02:52:19.50 --> 02:52:20.74
I mean, he's just like,

4276
02:52:20.74 --> 02:52:23.78
he's like one of those guys that just did everything.

4277
02:52:23.78 --> 02:52:24.62
You know what I mean?

4278
02:52:24.62 --> 02:52:27.46
He did a tour with the British War Commandos over in Europe.

4279
02:52:27.46 --> 02:52:30.10
I mean, he's just the most interesting man in the world.

4280
02:52:30.10 --> 02:52:34.30
And, you know, he's, it's still a downhill ski instructor

4281
02:52:34.30 --> 02:52:35.58
at Angel Fire, New Mexico.

4282
02:52:35.58 --> 02:52:36.62
He's in his 70s.

4283
02:52:36.62 --> 02:52:38.30
I mean, you wouldn't know it.

4284
02:52:38.30 --> 02:52:41.02
The guy is just, he doesn't stop.

4285
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:44.58
Huge impact on me in my life.

4286
02:52:44.58 --> 02:52:48.62
And then all the other guys that work with Omnit,

4287
02:52:48.62 --> 02:52:52.38
you know, of course, you know, we start out with Marines.

4288
02:52:52.38 --> 02:52:55.98
And then we started expanding to where like in Wildland Fire,

4289
02:52:55.98 --> 02:52:59.54
they were like, can we develop staff rides for Wildland Fire?

4290
02:52:59.54 --> 02:53:02.34
So you got like South Canyon Fatality Fires.

4291
02:53:03.38 --> 02:53:06.74
The Dude Fire down in Arizona,

4292
02:53:06.74 --> 02:53:10.66
you've got what the movie came out with, Only the Brave,

4293
02:53:10.66 --> 02:53:12.66
was about the Yarno Hill Fire.

4294
02:53:12.66 --> 02:53:13.94
We developed that staff ride.

4295
02:53:13.94 --> 02:53:16.54
That's what I was just at last week doing those.

4296
02:53:16.54 --> 02:53:20.14
Because like I said, I mean, it's experiential leadership.

4297
02:53:20.14 --> 02:53:21.46
And it's not necessarily,

4298
02:53:21.46 --> 02:53:23.94
it's armchair quarterbacking the events,

4299
02:53:23.94 --> 02:53:26.54
but you're not there to refight the fire or refight the battle.

4300
02:53:26.54 --> 02:53:28.58
You're there to take a step back

4301
02:53:28.58 --> 02:53:31.74
and look at the leadership decisions that were made.

4302
02:53:33.02 --> 02:53:35.98
And how could we learn from that?

4303
02:53:35.98 --> 02:53:38.10
How can we move forward?

4304
02:53:38.10 --> 02:53:41.62
And then like teaming up with you guys, you know what I mean?

4305
02:53:41.62 --> 02:53:43.42
Like I can remember when I first,

4306
02:53:43.42 --> 02:53:46.86
when like Steve and Jason who I love,

4307
02:53:46.86 --> 02:53:49.46
because they are just class act characters.

4308
02:53:50.78 --> 02:53:54.14
Like when we got done with the first staff ride,

4309
02:53:54.14 --> 02:53:55.94
you know, a few years back,

4310
02:53:55.94 --> 02:53:59.18
and we're sitting in the room and they're like,

4311
02:53:59.18 --> 02:54:01.78
dude, this was so much fun.

4312
02:54:01.78 --> 02:54:05.90
Like the interaction with the participants

4313
02:54:05.90 --> 02:54:08.26
that are there, the people that you get to meet.

4314
02:54:08.26 --> 02:54:10.02
I mean, you remember, I mean, some of the folks,

4315
02:54:10.02 --> 02:54:12.50
I mean, they even came back and did little big horn works.

4316
02:54:12.50 --> 02:54:16.10
You know, and just the experience

4317
02:54:16.10 --> 02:54:20.54
on the leadership aspect of experiencing it that there,

4318
02:54:20.54 --> 02:54:23.26
to me, you just, you can't get it from a classroom.

4319
02:54:23.26 --> 02:54:25.54
You can't get it from a book.

4320
02:54:25.54 --> 02:54:27.46
You know, when you're standing, you know,

4321
02:54:27.46 --> 02:54:30.66
in the Peach Orchard at Gettysburg,

4322
02:54:30.66 --> 02:54:33.26
and the discussions that you're having of,

4323
02:54:33.26 --> 02:54:35.18
I mean, everybody has a dance circles

4324
02:54:35.18 --> 02:54:36.66
in their organization.

4325
02:54:36.66 --> 02:54:38.50
Everybody, it's just for 10,000 years,

4326
02:54:38.50 --> 02:54:41.38
we've been trying to figure out how to deal with people.

4327
02:54:41.38 --> 02:54:45.70
And delivering of a staff ride, it's so memorable,

4328
02:54:45.70 --> 02:54:47.70
like of being there.

4329
02:54:47.70 --> 02:54:50.26
And you know, it's just so,

4330
02:54:50.26 --> 02:54:52.50
we basically developed a business

4331
02:54:52.50 --> 02:54:56.58
around experiential staff rides.

4332
02:54:56.58 --> 02:55:01.58
And, you know, and we do it for, you know, fish and wildlife,

4333
02:55:01.58 --> 02:55:06.22
US Forest Service, FDNY, San Diego Lifeguards,

4334
02:55:06.22 --> 02:55:08.70
I took the San Diego Lifeguards, the Gettysburg,

4335
02:55:08.70 --> 02:55:10.50
which was like super cool.

4336
02:55:10.50 --> 02:55:12.50
Like those are a great bunch of guys.

4337
02:55:12.50 --> 02:55:15.10
And I learned more from them than they probably did for me.

4338
02:55:15.10 --> 02:55:17.18
Like I didn't know they were sworn officers

4339
02:55:17.18 --> 02:55:19.94
and could write tickets, but they don't get a gun.

4340
02:55:19.94 --> 02:55:22.58
Talk about the ability to use your, you know,

4341
02:55:22.58 --> 02:55:23.90
your communication skills.

4342
02:55:23.90 --> 02:55:25.94
You better be pretty good.

4343
02:55:25.94 --> 02:55:26.78
You know what I mean?

4344
02:55:26.78 --> 02:55:27.86
And, you know, bringing them to Gettysburg,

4345
02:55:27.86 --> 02:55:29.10
everybody's like, you know, in Gettysburg,

4346
02:55:29.10 --> 02:55:31.54
like who are these, it's like their lifeguards,

4347
02:55:31.54 --> 02:55:34.94
like from San Diego, like, I mean, the whole Baywatch.

4348
02:55:34.94 --> 02:55:37.50
I mean, the guys are just phenomenal people.

4349
02:55:38.46 --> 02:55:39.98
And then we do a lot, Orange County,

4350
02:55:39.98 --> 02:55:41.70
like I know you've done stuff with Orange County,

4351
02:55:41.70 --> 02:55:43.42
fire authority up the road.

4352
02:55:43.42 --> 02:55:45.86
But then when you meet like the smoke jumpers

4353
02:55:45.86 --> 02:55:48.74
and the hotshots, that's like kind of like these people,

4354
02:55:48.74 --> 02:55:50.74
like if we would have had Discovery Channel,

4355
02:55:50.74 --> 02:55:52.82
like when you and I were kids in the 80s

4356
02:55:52.82 --> 02:55:54.22
and I would have seen like, wait a minute,

4357
02:55:54.22 --> 02:55:56.94
I can get paid money to get a chainsaw,

4358
02:55:56.94 --> 02:55:59.34
which are always fun to operate.

4359
02:55:59.34 --> 02:56:02.22
And you're gonna let me jump out of an aircraft

4360
02:56:02.22 --> 02:56:04.30
in the middle of nowhere and fight fire.

4361
02:56:04.30 --> 02:56:06.10
And I'm gonna get paid.

4362
02:56:06.10 --> 02:56:08.90
Like that's badass.

4363
02:56:08.90 --> 02:56:10.18
And just like with the hotshots,

4364
02:56:10.18 --> 02:56:11.82
I mean, we're gonna put me in a buggy.

4365
02:56:11.82 --> 02:56:15.06
We're gonna ride around with like 20 to 30 other men

4366
02:56:15.06 --> 02:56:18.10
and women that just wanna get after it,

4367
02:56:18.10 --> 02:56:18.94
you know what I mean?

4368
02:56:18.94 --> 02:56:21.10
With a Pulaski, you know what I mean?

4369
02:56:21.10 --> 02:56:23.62
And fight wild land fire.

4370
02:56:23.62 --> 02:56:27.50
I mean, they're just great people.

4371
02:56:27.50 --> 02:56:30.26
They provide a great service to the country.

4372
02:56:30.26 --> 02:56:32.78
But growing up in Virginia, West Virginia,

4373
02:56:32.78 --> 02:56:35.10
we don't have wild land fire like here.

4374
02:56:35.10 --> 02:56:36.62
I mean, like everybody out here,

4375
02:56:36.62 --> 02:56:39.90
you all in Cali know what wild land fire is.

4376
02:56:39.90 --> 02:56:40.86
It's the West Coast thing.

4377
02:56:40.86 --> 02:56:45.42
Yeah, but yeah, that would be such a cool job.

4378
02:56:45.42 --> 02:56:47.22
And they're just great people.

4379
02:56:47.22 --> 02:56:49.18
Yeah, that's a freaking hard job, man.

4380
02:56:49.18 --> 02:56:51.34
You and I were talking earlier today

4381
02:56:51.34 --> 02:56:53.70
and just when you've been in the military

4382
02:56:53.70 --> 02:56:54.90
and you look at a hill

4383
02:56:56.34 --> 02:56:58.66
and you know what it takes to walk up a hill,

4384
02:56:58.66 --> 02:57:00.62
you appreciate hills.

4385
02:57:00.62 --> 02:57:02.58
And those wild land fire guys, man,

4386
02:57:02.58 --> 02:57:04.70
they just actually, I have a guy that guided me

4387
02:57:04.70 --> 02:57:07.02
a couple of hunts and he's a wild land fire guy.

4388
02:57:07.02 --> 02:57:09.10
And I mean, you wanna talk about a dude

4389
02:57:09.10 --> 02:57:11.62
that could hoof out some miles, bro?

4390
02:57:11.62 --> 02:57:14.70
I mean, this dude was just like, okay.

4391
02:57:14.70 --> 02:57:17.90
I mean, with no expression on his face, you know,

4392
02:57:17.90 --> 02:57:21.30
other than like, where are we going next?

4393
02:57:21.30 --> 02:57:23.14
No factor, like no factor.

4394
02:57:23.14 --> 02:57:24.46
This guy's put some miles in, man.

4395
02:57:24.46 --> 02:57:26.14
These are like mountain goats.

4396
02:57:26.14 --> 02:57:26.98
They're like mountain goats.

4397
02:57:26.98 --> 02:57:29.50
Yeah, I mean, and they, with like gas cans

4398
02:57:29.50 --> 02:57:32.30
and they got like chainsaws.

4399
02:57:32.30 --> 02:57:34.10
And they do, I mean, it's a,

4400
02:57:34.10 --> 02:57:37.48
and they're just a great community of people.

4401
02:57:37.48 --> 02:57:40.78
So I had the experience, I do a lot with those folks

4402
02:57:40.78 --> 02:57:42.86
and they've expanded to where now with Omna,

4403
02:57:42.86 --> 02:57:45.90
now we've got former, I got a former hotshots,

4404
02:57:45.90 --> 02:57:47.38
former wild land firefighters.

4405
02:57:47.38 --> 02:57:49.42
They got former forest ranger.

4406
02:57:49.42 --> 02:57:50.94
You know what I mean?

4407
02:57:50.94 --> 02:57:52.50
That she works with us.

4408
02:57:52.50 --> 02:57:56.42
I mean, just the people that I've had the opportunity

4409
02:57:56.42 --> 02:58:00.22
to meet over the past 12 years of doing this.

4410
02:58:00.22 --> 02:58:02.06
I mean, it's just, it's amazing.

4411
02:58:02.06 --> 02:58:04.50
And of course, like I enjoy the hell out of it,

4412
02:58:04.50 --> 02:58:06.78
which makes it even better.

4413
02:58:06.78 --> 02:58:09.22
You know, what I don't have to go to a cubicle.

4414
02:58:09.22 --> 02:58:10.50
And you know what I mean?

4415
02:58:10.50 --> 02:58:12.74
We get the, and you know, it's like my wife's like,

4416
02:58:12.74 --> 02:58:14.22
what are you doing over there?

4417
02:58:14.22 --> 02:58:15.70
I'm working.

4418
02:58:15.70 --> 02:58:16.54
Allegedly.

4419
02:58:16.54 --> 02:58:17.54
No, you're reading a book.

4420
02:58:17.54 --> 02:58:19.26
That's my job.

4421
02:58:19.26 --> 02:58:20.94
I get to read.

4422
02:58:20.94 --> 02:58:24.42
Well, you know, we were lucky enough to link up

4423
02:58:24.42 --> 02:58:28.26
and we bring a lot of corporate people in.

4424
02:58:28.26 --> 02:58:30.38
We bring everyone in, a lot of corporate people,

4425
02:58:30.38 --> 02:58:33.26
a lot of business people in that go through these staff rides

4426
02:58:33.26 --> 02:58:35.68
and pass on these lessons learned.

4427
02:58:36.90 --> 02:58:39.78
And there's so much to learn from these events

4428
02:58:39.78 --> 02:58:41.50
and the leadership and the personalities

4429
02:58:41.50 --> 02:58:44.22
and the people that undergo them.

4430
02:58:44.22 --> 02:58:49.14
And I was talking to you and I always feel

4431
02:58:49.14 --> 02:58:51.62
kind of selfish because I get to hang out with you.

4432
02:58:51.62 --> 02:58:55.06
And I was, and learn from these battlefields

4433
02:58:55.06 --> 02:58:55.90
and from these battles.

4434
02:58:55.90 --> 02:58:57.14
And I thought to myself, hey,

4435
02:58:57.14 --> 02:58:59.66
maybe we should try and extend this knowledge

4436
02:58:59.66 --> 02:59:00.50
to more people.

4437
02:59:00.50 --> 02:59:05.10
So I came up with an idea of doing a series of podcasts

4438
02:59:05.10 --> 02:59:07.98
about the Civil War battles.

4439
02:59:07.98 --> 02:59:11.74
And just so everybody knows, that's what we're doing.

4440
02:59:11.74 --> 02:59:14.22
We're gonna put together a series of podcasts

4441
02:59:14.22 --> 02:59:16.70
about the Civil War, where it's gonna be on this,

4442
02:59:16.70 --> 02:59:18.74
it's gonna be on this podcast feed.

4443
02:59:18.74 --> 02:59:23.22
It's gonna be Jocko podcast, Civil War Excursion.

4444
02:59:23.22 --> 02:59:24.94
Cause it's gonna, you know, there's some people that make,

4445
02:59:24.94 --> 02:59:27.50
I don't really feel like listening to Civil War.

4446
02:59:27.50 --> 02:59:29.38
And if you don't wanna listen to it, that's fine.

4447
02:59:29.38 --> 02:59:30.78
You probably will.

4448
02:59:30.78 --> 02:59:32.70
It's sitting here talking to you.

4449
02:59:34.30 --> 02:59:36.38
It's like trying to, I can't wait.

4450
02:59:36.38 --> 02:59:38.26
I can't wait to pull the string on your back

4451
02:59:38.26 --> 02:59:40.26
where you just start talking about Civil War

4452
02:59:40.26 --> 02:59:43.18
and battles and personalities, man, it's awesome.

4453
02:59:43.18 --> 02:59:48.78
And yeah, you'll be hearing a bunch from JD on this feed.

4454
02:59:50.10 --> 02:59:50.94
Yeah.

4455
02:59:50.94 --> 02:59:51.66
What do we miss?

4456
02:59:51.66 --> 02:59:53.58
We miss anything else?

4457
02:59:53.58 --> 02:59:57.62
No, that's pretty much it.

4458
02:59:57.62 --> 03:00:00.98
I remember when I talked to you like one of the first times

4459
03:00:00.98 --> 03:00:02.90
when your book came out Extreme Ownership,

4460
03:00:02.90 --> 03:00:04.54
and of course I'd read it.

4461
03:00:04.54 --> 03:00:06.94
And I had some of the folks that I deal with

4462
03:00:06.94 --> 03:00:10.18
that that was like a pre-read.

4463
03:00:10.18 --> 03:00:12.38
You know, cause a lot of the people that we deal with,

4464
03:00:12.38 --> 03:00:16.82
we encourage reading lists in any organization.

4465
03:00:16.82 --> 03:00:19.38
Like everybody should read.

4466
03:00:19.38 --> 03:00:22.38
And that was one of the books, Extreme Ownership,

4467
03:00:22.38 --> 03:00:23.90
prior to us going to Little Bighorn.

4468
03:00:23.90 --> 03:00:27.14
So, and when you actually look at it after the fact,

4469
03:00:27.14 --> 03:00:30.62
and being with you and all the guys with Eshalon Front

4470
03:00:30.62 --> 03:00:33.46
and doing it now, when you look at like the battlefield,

4471
03:00:33.46 --> 03:00:36.14
you could be like, well, that definitely did not

4472
03:00:37.18 --> 03:00:38.54
show any Extreme Ownership.

4473
03:00:38.54 --> 03:00:39.38
Oh yeah.

4474
03:00:39.38 --> 03:00:40.22
You know what I mean?

4475
03:00:40.22 --> 03:00:43.58
It's crazy to go out and, you know, I used to tell the platoons

4476
03:00:43.58 --> 03:00:45.58
when I was taking a platoon to Land Warfare

4477
03:00:45.58 --> 03:00:47.70
or urban training, I'd say, look,

4478
03:00:47.70 --> 03:00:48.82
I know the mistakes you're gonna make.

4479
03:00:48.82 --> 03:00:50.94
I already know the mistakes you're gonna make.

4480
03:00:50.94 --> 03:00:52.90
And you're not gonna cover and move.

4481
03:00:52.90 --> 03:00:54.50
You're gonna make things too complicated.

4482
03:00:54.50 --> 03:00:55.34
You're not, you're gonna have,

4483
03:00:55.34 --> 03:00:56.62
trying to do too many things at once.

4484
03:00:56.62 --> 03:00:58.66
You're gonna have centralized command.

4485
03:00:58.66 --> 03:01:00.74
Everything's gonna fall apart.

4486
03:01:00.74 --> 03:01:03.58
If you follow these simple rules, you're gonna do good.

4487
03:01:03.58 --> 03:01:06.42
And it's so crazy to look back at history

4488
03:01:06.42 --> 03:01:09.02
and look back at Gettysburg or Little Bighorn.

4489
03:01:09.02 --> 03:01:10.94
And you can say, oh, no cover and move right here.

4490
03:01:10.94 --> 03:01:11.78
Everything falls apart.

4491
03:01:11.78 --> 03:01:12.94
Oh, they had too complicated.

4492
03:01:12.94 --> 03:01:13.90
Everything falls apart.

4493
03:01:13.90 --> 03:01:15.70
Oh, trying to do too many things at once.

4494
03:01:15.70 --> 03:01:16.74
Everything falls apart.

4495
03:01:16.74 --> 03:01:19.94
Oh, the commander's trying to direct every single person.

4496
03:01:19.94 --> 03:01:20.86
Everything falls apart.

4497
03:01:20.86 --> 03:01:24.86
The same mistakes get made in the Civil War,

4498
03:01:24.86 --> 03:01:29.38
in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, any war, pretty much.

4499
03:01:29.38 --> 03:01:30.70
The same mistakes get made.

4500
03:01:30.70 --> 03:01:33.02
The same leadership makes mistakes get made.

4501
03:01:33.02 --> 03:01:35.54
And what's crazy is that the same leadership mistakes

4502
03:01:35.54 --> 03:01:39.26
get made in any organization, in any organization.

4503
03:01:39.26 --> 03:01:40.58
It's they don't support each other.

4504
03:01:40.58 --> 03:01:42.02
They make things too complicated.

4505
03:01:42.02 --> 03:01:43.98
They don't figure out their priorities.

4506
03:01:43.98 --> 03:01:45.70
They don't focus their efforts.

4507
03:01:45.70 --> 03:01:48.78
And they try and centralize and control everything.

4508
03:01:48.78 --> 03:01:50.58
And all those things are bad.

4509
03:01:50.58 --> 03:01:52.34
And when you come out,

4510
03:01:52.34 --> 03:01:54.38
and we, the next thing we're doing with you,

4511
03:01:54.38 --> 03:01:55.74
let me look at the dates here.

4512
03:01:55.74 --> 03:01:58.84
It's, what do we got?

4513
03:01:59.78 --> 03:02:03.34
Next battlefield is March 21st through the 23rd

4514
03:02:03.34 --> 03:02:05.58
on the hollowed grounds of Gettysburg.

4515
03:02:06.78 --> 03:02:08.22
You know, there is a whole,

4516
03:02:08.22 --> 03:02:10.42
like I said, this was Jason, you know, when Jason was on,

4517
03:02:10.42 --> 03:02:12.98
there's like a spiritual side to this.

4518
03:02:12.98 --> 03:02:14.50
There's a leadership side, sure,

4519
03:02:14.50 --> 03:02:16.94
but you go on to that battlefield

4520
03:02:16.94 --> 03:02:21.94
and you feel the sacrifice that was made.

4521
03:02:22.74 --> 03:02:25.78
And it's very powerful.

4522
03:02:25.78 --> 03:02:27.62
Both at Gettysburg and Little Big Horn,

4523
03:02:27.62 --> 03:02:29.82
and I'm sure we're gonna do a bunch of other battlefields

4524
03:02:29.82 --> 03:02:30.66
in the future.

4525
03:02:30.66 --> 03:02:31.94
But if anybody wants to come,

4526
03:02:31.94 --> 03:02:33.62
to walk the battlefield with us,

4527
03:02:35.30 --> 03:02:39.14
escalonfront.com, check out the next EF battlefield.

4528
03:02:39.14 --> 03:02:41.02
It's March 21st through the 23rd.

4529
03:02:43.14 --> 03:02:48.14
For your company, for Omna, it's theomna.com.

4530
03:02:49.50 --> 03:02:51.82
So you do stuff all over the place.

4531
03:02:51.82 --> 03:02:53.46
You run a bunch of these events.

4532
03:02:53.46 --> 03:02:55.78
Your people run a bunch of these events.

4533
03:02:55.78 --> 03:02:58.62
You're on Instagram, Omna underscore international.

4534
03:02:58.62 --> 03:03:02.58
You're on Facebook, Omna international LLC.

4535
03:03:02.58 --> 03:03:04.82
That's, if people wanna find you,

4536
03:03:04.82 --> 03:03:06.78
that's where they can find you.

4537
03:03:06.78 --> 03:03:08.18
And that's where they can find some of the courses

4538
03:03:08.18 --> 03:03:11.10
that you guys are running, which is awesome.

4539
03:03:11.10 --> 03:03:12.30
What else, Echo, you got anything?

4540
03:03:12.30 --> 03:03:13.26
You got any questions?

4541
03:03:13.26 --> 03:03:15.46
Oh, what year again were you at Navy?

4542
03:03:16.54 --> 03:03:20.38
I was at Navy 2003 and left 2006.

4543
03:03:20.38 --> 03:03:22.66
Oh, damn, because we'd play them a lot.

4544
03:03:22.66 --> 03:03:23.94
I played at Universal Hawaii,

4545
03:03:23.94 --> 03:03:26.70
so that we were in the same conference.

4546
03:03:26.70 --> 03:03:27.54
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4547
03:03:27.54 --> 03:03:30.34
That's where I was the head coach at Navy, Ken.

4548
03:03:30.34 --> 03:03:33.34
Neymar, he quarterbacked at Hawaii.

4549
03:03:33.34 --> 03:03:35.50
Did you play in the Naval Academy?

4550
03:03:35.50 --> 03:03:37.02
You played against them?

4551
03:03:37.02 --> 03:03:38.58
I didn't play the game, no.

4552
03:03:38.58 --> 03:03:40.26
But we played that man the team did,

4553
03:03:40.26 --> 03:03:41.46
but I personally did not.

4554
03:03:41.46 --> 03:03:42.58
You were on the bench, kinda?

4555
03:03:42.58 --> 03:03:44.30
I was on the bench, I was red-shirting.

4556
03:03:44.30 --> 03:03:45.82
Oh, sure.

4557
03:03:45.82 --> 03:03:48.38
But yeah, that was a little bit before that time, no.

4558
03:03:48.38 --> 03:03:50.34
95 to 98.

4559
03:03:50.34 --> 03:03:51.78
Oh, okay, yeah.

4560
03:03:51.78 --> 03:03:52.86
Did you get special treatment

4561
03:03:52.86 --> 03:03:54.58
at University of Hawaii being on the football team?

4562
03:03:54.58 --> 03:03:56.58
Yes, yeah, they do.

4563
03:03:56.58 --> 03:03:58.54
And that makes sense too,

4564
03:03:58.54 --> 03:04:01.78
because a lot of times football brings in a lot of the money.

4565
03:04:01.78 --> 03:04:04.18
So you have that dynamic for sure.

4566
03:04:04.18 --> 03:04:07.98
Yeah, when you look at the football division one,

4567
03:04:07.98 --> 03:04:09.46
to compete, I can remember,

4568
03:04:09.46 --> 03:04:11.30
I had a lot of cool opportunities.

4569
03:04:11.30 --> 03:04:13.94
Like I got to travel with the team.

4570
03:04:13.94 --> 03:04:16.58
So like we go play Notre Dame.

4571
03:04:16.58 --> 03:04:18.38
I mean, that's big school, man.

4572
03:04:18.38 --> 03:04:19.66
That's a big program.

4573
03:04:19.66 --> 03:04:20.50
You know what I mean?

4574
03:04:20.50 --> 03:04:22.26
So I'm over, because I'm a gunny,

4575
03:04:22.26 --> 03:04:24.02
I can just go wherever I want.

4576
03:04:24.02 --> 03:04:26.14
So I go over to their locker room.

4577
03:04:26.14 --> 03:04:28.58
The size of those dudes,

4578
03:04:28.58 --> 03:04:31.26
like compared to the Naval Academy of the Chittester,

4579
03:04:31.26 --> 03:04:32.10
you know what I mean?

4580
03:04:32.10 --> 03:04:33.78
They were tree trunks, man.

4581
03:04:33.78 --> 03:04:34.62
These dudes were,

4582
03:04:34.62 --> 03:04:36.42
I walk back over one of the quarterbacks

4583
03:04:36.42 --> 03:04:38.78
at Navy, Craig Candido.

4584
03:04:38.78 --> 03:04:40.22
I went over to Craig and I was like,

4585
03:04:40.22 --> 03:04:43.22
dude, I'm glad I'm not you today, bro.

4586
03:04:43.22 --> 03:04:46.42
Because you're running triple option football.

4587
03:04:46.42 --> 03:04:49.26
JD's pep talk, I'm glad I'm not you.

4588
03:04:49.26 --> 03:04:52.94
I mean, they should have sent you back to be,

4589
03:04:52.94 --> 03:04:55.58
back to Annapolis after that pep talk.

4590
03:04:55.58 --> 03:04:58.18
I mean, those dudes, I mean, that's,

4591
03:04:58.18 --> 03:04:59.62
and that's where, you know,

4592
03:04:59.62 --> 03:05:02.06
when you're talking about like having these kids there

4593
03:05:02.06 --> 03:05:04.18
compete at that level, like you at Hawaii,

4594
03:05:04.18 --> 03:05:06.02
I mean, it's a different,

4595
03:05:06.02 --> 03:05:08.62
that's just a different level of competition,

4596
03:05:08.62 --> 03:05:09.90
playing those folks, man.

4597
03:05:09.90 --> 03:05:12.06
There's some big, and those guys,

4598
03:05:12.06 --> 03:05:13.74
that's all they do is play football.

4599
03:05:13.74 --> 03:05:15.54
They're not doing double E and, you know,

4600
03:05:15.54 --> 03:05:17.14
worried about height weight requirements

4601
03:05:17.14 --> 03:05:18.38
and service selection.

4602
03:05:18.38 --> 03:05:20.74
They're there to play football and go pro.

4603
03:05:20.74 --> 03:05:23.02
Yeah, though, that's interesting how you talk about

4604
03:05:23.02 --> 03:05:24.86
a guy will be on the O line or the D line,

4605
03:05:24.86 --> 03:05:26.82
then he has to go change his whole body.

4606
03:05:26.82 --> 03:05:28.02
I was like, bro, that's true.

4607
03:05:28.02 --> 03:05:31.58
You can't be six, four, two, 90, over 300 pounds

4608
03:05:31.58 --> 03:05:34.10
and then want to run, you know, all these mountain bats.

4609
03:05:34.10 --> 03:05:34.94
It's not like that.

4610
03:05:34.94 --> 03:05:36.74
You got to become a different human.

4611
03:05:36.74 --> 03:05:38.50
You got to become a different human being.

4612
03:05:38.50 --> 03:05:42.94
Like getting change your DNA is what it boils down to.

4613
03:05:42.94 --> 03:05:43.78
Yeah, that's true.

4614
03:05:43.78 --> 03:05:45.54
I mean, I played a skill position,

4615
03:05:45.54 --> 03:05:49.18
but even like running three miles,

4616
03:05:49.18 --> 03:05:50.66
you're talking about eight miles,

4617
03:05:50.66 --> 03:05:53.54
marathons, all that, bro, I couldn't do that.

4618
03:05:53.54 --> 03:05:55.98
I could sprint pretty fast, but man,

4619
03:05:55.98 --> 03:05:58.86
the long distance is like a different kind of running.

4620
03:05:58.86 --> 03:06:01.94
Yeah, they used to do something called fourth quarters

4621
03:06:01.94 --> 03:06:03.18
and getting ready.

4622
03:06:03.18 --> 03:06:05.86
So it was kind of like they'd show up in the morning

4623
03:06:05.86 --> 03:06:08.34
out on the field and they would have stations.

4624
03:06:08.34 --> 03:06:09.18
Yeah, circuits.

4625
03:06:09.18 --> 03:06:10.66
Like fourth quarter circuit kind of stuff.

4626
03:06:10.66 --> 03:06:14.30
Well, you know, so I go and of course I've got cleats.

4627
03:06:14.30 --> 03:06:16.34
I've got everything, like I've got everything the kids have.

4628
03:06:16.34 --> 03:06:19.06
Like I love going to practice, you know what I mean?

4629
03:06:19.06 --> 03:06:22.10
And so I'm going to go do fourth quarters with the team.

4630
03:06:22.10 --> 03:06:25.58
So first day I go out and I pick skills players to go with.

4631
03:06:25.58 --> 03:06:27.14
Wrong move.

4632
03:06:27.14 --> 03:06:29.50
They're these guys, they're fast twitch muscles, man.

4633
03:06:29.50 --> 03:06:31.22
They're making me look silly.

4634
03:06:31.22 --> 03:06:32.06
You know what I mean?

4635
03:06:32.06 --> 03:06:33.94
And they weigh twice as much as you.

4636
03:06:33.94 --> 03:06:34.94
Oh yeah.

4637
03:06:34.94 --> 03:06:37.34
So the next day I'm going with O-line.

4638
03:06:39.06 --> 03:06:41.38
I went to one of my seal buddies with friends

4639
03:06:41.38 --> 03:06:43.14
with a bunch of San Diego Chargers

4640
03:06:43.14 --> 03:06:45.38
and I went to his wedding and dude,

4641
03:06:45.38 --> 03:06:48.02
these guys are just not, they're like a different species.

4642
03:06:48.02 --> 03:06:51.50
It's like when you look at a Chihuahua versus like a great

4643
03:06:51.50 --> 03:06:54.74
Dane and you think, how do these the same kind of animal?

4644
03:06:54.74 --> 03:06:56.50
I'm standing around looking at these dudes going,

4645
03:06:56.50 --> 03:06:58.74
how are these guys the same kind of animals to me?

4646
03:06:58.74 --> 03:07:00.66
Cause I don't like this at all.

4647
03:07:00.66 --> 03:07:01.50
Yeah.

4648
03:07:01.50 --> 03:07:02.34
Yeah.

4649
03:07:02.34 --> 03:07:03.82
I remember there was like one of the,

4650
03:07:03.82 --> 03:07:06.66
I think it was one of the Chargers here training with Sarge

4651
03:07:06.66 --> 03:07:09.02
and he was just teaching them some little bit of Jiu-Jitsu stuff.

4652
03:07:09.02 --> 03:07:10.46
And I looked at him and he was like,

4653
03:07:10.46 --> 03:07:13.22
I forget, I might've been a fullback or something.

4654
03:07:13.22 --> 03:07:14.42
And I remember looking at him and I said,

4655
03:07:14.42 --> 03:07:17.74
man, I forget, I forgot how big football players are.

4656
03:07:17.74 --> 03:07:19.90
And even thinking back, I know the numbers.

4657
03:07:19.90 --> 03:07:21.54
Like I know like my friend Jeff, he was,

4658
03:07:21.54 --> 03:07:23.82
he actually ended up playing for the 49ers.

4659
03:07:23.82 --> 03:07:28.50
Jeff Ulberg, he was six one, two, 55 and he ran a four, five.

4660
03:07:28.50 --> 03:07:30.26
And I remember at the time I'm thinking like,

4661
03:07:30.26 --> 03:07:33.30
oh man, he's pretty fast for like being a big, you know, guy,

4662
03:07:33.30 --> 03:07:35.38
but he's not big compared to like the D line

4663
03:07:35.38 --> 03:07:36.74
or the O line or whatever.

4664
03:07:36.74 --> 03:07:39.10
But man, me thinking about that right now,

4665
03:07:39.10 --> 03:07:41.02
but I'm not used to that kind of size anymore.

4666
03:07:41.02 --> 03:07:42.26
Usually it's just normal.

4667
03:07:42.26 --> 03:07:46.78
And running a four, five at 255, like when that guy hits you,

4668
03:07:46.78 --> 03:07:47.62
oh yeah.

4669
03:07:47.62 --> 03:07:49.70
That's not, that's not cool.

4670
03:07:49.70 --> 03:07:51.02
Bro, you're going down.

4671
03:07:51.02 --> 03:07:52.98
Like you're going down.

4672
03:07:52.98 --> 03:07:53.94
You're going down.

4673
03:07:53.94 --> 03:07:55.54
That's just pure power.

4674
03:07:55.54 --> 03:07:56.38
Oh yeah.

4675
03:07:56.38 --> 03:07:57.86
Yeah, these big Simone guys too.

4676
03:07:57.86 --> 03:08:01.50
Six, five, three, 30, three, 40.

4677
03:08:01.50 --> 03:08:02.58
And still fast.

4678
03:08:02.58 --> 03:08:03.42
The giant.

4679
03:08:03.42 --> 03:08:04.26
Oh yeah.

4680
03:08:04.26 --> 03:08:05.10
Yeah.

4681
03:08:05.10 --> 03:08:07.50
These pulling guards that come there just like this big mass

4682
03:08:07.50 --> 03:08:08.34
of a human.

4683
03:08:08.34 --> 03:08:09.22
Oh man.

4684
03:08:09.22 --> 03:08:11.54
Yeah, it's, I forget how big they are.

4685
03:08:11.54 --> 03:08:14.86
Yeah, that's why we invented gun power.

4686
03:08:14.86 --> 03:08:15.70
Oh yeah.

4687
03:08:15.70 --> 03:08:16.54
Oh yeah.

4688
03:08:16.54 --> 03:08:19.86
Of course.

4689
03:08:19.86 --> 03:08:22.54
Anything else, anything else JD?

4690
03:08:22.54 --> 03:08:25.78
We're going to get a big dose of you on the podcast here.

4691
03:08:27.58 --> 03:08:28.78
Anything else from you?

4692
03:08:30.10 --> 03:08:34.34
Let's talk about how to support this podcast.

4693
03:08:34.34 --> 03:08:36.26
How to support America, right?

4694
03:08:36.26 --> 03:08:38.98
And of course, want to support ourselves.

4695
03:08:38.98 --> 03:08:40.74
Speaking of being jacked.

4696
03:08:42.34 --> 03:08:44.26
Good tool for being jacked, creatine.

4697
03:08:44.26 --> 03:08:45.10
Yes.

4698
03:08:45.10 --> 03:08:45.94
Creatine is out.

4699
03:08:45.94 --> 03:08:46.78
Creatine is out.

4700
03:08:46.78 --> 03:08:47.82
We just came out with creatine.

4701
03:08:47.82 --> 03:08:48.66
That's good.

4702
03:08:48.66 --> 03:08:50.66
How long were you thinking about doing that?

4703
03:08:51.62 --> 03:08:53.50
Cause I remember the idea came up a long time ago.

4704
03:08:53.50 --> 03:08:54.34
Yeah, yeah.

4705
03:08:54.34 --> 03:08:55.26
Just the idea.

4706
03:08:55.26 --> 03:08:58.38
It was one of those things where we had to be able to do it

4707
03:08:58.38 --> 03:09:00.54
at a scale where it made sense.

4708
03:09:00.54 --> 03:09:03.86
Because, because we, I don't just want to be like,

4709
03:09:03.86 --> 03:09:05.26
oh, we'll just throw our name in the hat

4710
03:09:05.26 --> 03:09:06.10
with everybody else.

4711
03:09:06.10 --> 03:09:08.10
I want to make it good and all that stuff.

4712
03:09:08.10 --> 03:09:10.06
But yeah, it's been, it's been a,

4713
03:09:10.06 --> 03:09:12.70
it's probably been a few years that we were,

4714
03:09:12.70 --> 03:09:15.10
had that in the, in the queue.

4715
03:09:15.10 --> 03:09:15.94
It makes sense.

4716
03:09:15.94 --> 03:09:17.58
Cause it is one of those supplements

4717
03:09:17.58 --> 03:09:19.90
that's like reliably good.

4718
03:09:19.90 --> 03:09:21.66
Kind of across the board, you know?

4719
03:09:21.66 --> 03:09:22.50
All right. It's crazy.

4720
03:09:22.50 --> 03:09:25.02
But on that little video you made when you're like,

4721
03:09:25.02 --> 03:09:26.58
yeah, in the nineties and it's weird.

4722
03:09:26.58 --> 03:09:28.62
That's when I really heard about it the most.

4723
03:09:28.62 --> 03:09:30.98
Yeah. What's cool is that that's,

4724
03:09:30.98 --> 03:09:32.90
I remember when it came out.

4725
03:09:33.82 --> 03:09:36.26
It came out and I remember it.

4726
03:09:36.26 --> 03:09:38.70
Everyone's like, dude, creatine, creatine, creatine.

4727
03:09:38.70 --> 03:09:40.66
And what I got on creatine, I was on deployment

4728
03:09:40.66 --> 03:09:45.30
on the USS Cleveland, the steaming cleave.

4729
03:09:45.30 --> 03:09:48.74
And I brought cruise boxes with this protein powder

4730
03:09:48.74 --> 03:09:50.66
that had creatine in it.

4731
03:09:50.66 --> 03:09:52.34
And this is the one that I talk about where it's vanilla.

4732
03:09:52.34 --> 03:09:53.90
I don't even like vanilla to this day

4733
03:09:53.90 --> 03:09:55.58
cause I drank vanilla protein shakes

4734
03:09:55.58 --> 03:09:57.02
for six straight months.

4735
03:09:57.02 --> 03:10:00.50
And I would hold my nose like it was bad tequila

4736
03:10:00.50 --> 03:10:02.58
and just like, got it down.

4737
03:10:02.58 --> 03:10:03.54
You don't have to do that anymore.

4738
03:10:03.54 --> 03:10:08.30
You can get Johncofuel.com, get your creatine, get jacked.

4739
03:10:08.30 --> 03:10:10.78
The other cool thing is they've done so much research on it now.

4740
03:10:10.78 --> 03:10:14.42
It like helps, it just doesn't only help you get stronger.

4741
03:10:14.42 --> 03:10:15.98
Helps your athletic performance.

4742
03:10:15.98 --> 03:10:17.94
Helps your cognitive function.

4743
03:10:17.94 --> 03:10:20.62
Like it's just straight good for you.

4744
03:10:20.62 --> 03:10:22.10
So if you want to get some of that,

4745
03:10:22.10 --> 03:10:23.10
Johncofuel.com.

4746
03:10:23.10 --> 03:10:25.14
And that's not to mention resistance training,

4747
03:10:25.14 --> 03:10:27.66
all the studies that they've been putting into that.

4748
03:10:27.66 --> 03:10:29.54
All the benefits of resistance training.

4749
03:10:29.54 --> 03:10:31.34
So now you got the creatine supporting the resistance

4750
03:10:31.34 --> 03:10:33.42
training, supporting all the other functions of your body.

4751
03:10:33.42 --> 03:10:35.22
Yeah, resistance training, Jack.

4752
03:10:35.22 --> 03:10:36.94
Resistance training, no offense JD.

4753
03:10:36.94 --> 03:10:38.30
Because I know you're a runner.

4754
03:10:38.30 --> 03:10:39.86
Do you jack steel at all?

4755
03:10:39.86 --> 03:10:41.94
No, I just, calisthenics?

4756
03:10:41.94 --> 03:10:42.94
Yeah, I do pull ups.

4757
03:10:42.94 --> 03:10:44.14
I got a pull up bar.

4758
03:10:44.14 --> 03:10:45.50
Yeah, pull ups, calisthenics.

4759
03:10:45.50 --> 03:10:46.38
That's resistance.

4760
03:10:46.38 --> 03:10:47.70
That's just old school Marine Corps.

4761
03:10:47.70 --> 03:10:49.18
Yeah, no jacking of steel.

4762
03:10:49.18 --> 03:10:50.58
Jacking of steel.

4763
03:10:50.58 --> 03:10:51.82
You jacked your shoulder.

4764
03:10:51.82 --> 03:10:54.62
No, you're not jacking steel.

4765
03:10:54.62 --> 03:10:56.06
What else?

4766
03:10:56.06 --> 03:10:57.42
Discipline go, right?

4767
03:10:57.42 --> 03:11:00.50
Energy drink, redefined, healthy, all good stuff,

4768
03:11:00.50 --> 03:11:01.38
no bad stuff.

4769
03:11:01.38 --> 03:11:04.26
Can you imagine just having something that's got no downside?

4770
03:11:04.26 --> 03:11:06.22
How legit is that?

4771
03:11:06.22 --> 03:11:07.06
It's very legit.

4772
03:11:07.06 --> 03:11:08.02
That's the legit here.

4773
03:11:08.02 --> 03:11:10.94
No downside, there's no price to pay.

4774
03:11:10.94 --> 03:11:13.18
Oh, it costs three bucks or whatever.

4775
03:11:13.18 --> 03:11:14.02
Oh yeah, like everything else.

4776
03:11:14.02 --> 03:11:17.58
There's no price to pay physically, health wise.

4777
03:11:17.58 --> 03:11:18.82
Same thing with a ready to drink milk.

4778
03:11:18.82 --> 03:11:20.02
Did you get a shipment yet?

4779
03:11:20.02 --> 03:11:20.86
Yes, I did.

4780
03:11:20.86 --> 03:11:22.02
Ha ha ha.

4781
03:11:22.02 --> 03:11:22.86
It's a game changer.

4782
03:11:22.86 --> 03:11:24.42
My kids are stealing them.

4783
03:11:24.42 --> 03:11:25.42
It's gonna be gone.

4784
03:11:25.42 --> 03:11:26.26
It's gonna be gone.

4785
03:11:26.26 --> 03:11:27.34
There's no way you can have ready to drink milk

4786
03:11:27.34 --> 03:11:28.30
in the house with children.

4787
03:11:28.30 --> 03:11:30.34
I had to make a rule, straight up rule.

4788
03:11:30.34 --> 03:11:32.42
Like you're not allowed to have these kind of things.

4789
03:11:32.42 --> 03:11:33.26
The off limits.

4790
03:11:33.26 --> 03:11:34.10
Yeah, off limits.

4791
03:11:34.10 --> 03:11:34.94
Those are just for you.

4792
03:11:34.94 --> 03:11:35.78
Oh yeah.

4793
03:11:35.78 --> 03:11:37.50
You can't drink it all, straight up.

4794
03:11:37.50 --> 03:11:39.10
That's why I made the rule.

4795
03:11:39.10 --> 03:11:41.38
Well, we're making as much as we can.

4796
03:11:41.38 --> 03:11:43.82
We got it on the web.

4797
03:11:43.82 --> 03:11:46.98
So yeah, the ready to drink milk, it's freaking awesome.

4798
03:11:46.98 --> 03:11:48.78
It's a game, it's kind of a game changer.

4799
03:11:48.78 --> 03:11:50.30
It is kind of a game changer.

4800
03:11:50.30 --> 03:11:51.62
You know why I think it's a game changer?

4801
03:11:51.62 --> 03:11:55.46
Because man, there's no reason to eat anything else.

4802
03:11:55.46 --> 03:11:57.38
Like, you know maybe you're walking by,

4803
03:11:57.38 --> 03:11:58.54
no, you know what I'm saying?

4804
03:11:58.54 --> 03:12:00.94
Like you're walking by the fridge and you're like,

4805
03:12:00.94 --> 03:12:02.10
well what can I have right now?

4806
03:12:02.10 --> 03:12:04.54
And you're kind of, everything's an effort

4807
03:12:04.54 --> 03:12:06.66
and it's got the downside, you know?

4808
03:12:06.66 --> 03:12:08.14
With a mulk, ready to drink.

4809
03:12:08.14 --> 03:12:10.78
There's no, there's zero, once again, no downside.

4810
03:12:10.78 --> 03:12:12.26
You don't have to make it.

4811
03:12:12.26 --> 03:12:14.54
You just have to twist the freaking cap off, bro.

4812
03:12:14.54 --> 03:12:15.38
You're in.

4813
03:12:15.38 --> 03:12:17.70
You're correct about that.

4814
03:12:17.70 --> 03:12:19.82
So get yourself some ready to drink milk.

4815
03:12:19.82 --> 03:12:21.18
Get yourself some creatine.

4816
03:12:21.18 --> 03:12:23.30

4832
03:12:52.46 --> 03:12:54.06
Meyer in the Midwest.

4833
03:12:54.06 --> 03:12:55.70
So go get yourself some jockofuel.

4834

That's a thing.

4836
03:12:58.50 --> 03:13:00.14
Not too many things in this world.

4837
03:13:00.14 --> 03:13:02.94
Not too many things in this world, no downside.

4838
03:13:02.94 --> 03:13:04.38
MorganUSA.com.

4839
03:13:05.58 --> 03:13:10.58
Jeans, boots, geese, hunt gear,

4840
03:13:11.22 --> 03:13:14.70
rash guards, t-shirts, beanies.

4841
03:13:14.70 --> 03:13:16.62
How long is this gonna go?

4842
03:13:16.62 --> 03:13:17.74
This could go a while.

4843
03:13:17.74 --> 03:13:20.22
Here's the thing, all made in America.

4844
03:13:20.22 --> 03:13:21.98
Right now you're seeing some stuff on the news right now.

4845
03:13:21.98 --> 03:13:24.94
You're seeing in China there's a practical revolution

4846
03:13:24.94 --> 03:13:25.94
happening right now.

4847
03:13:27.34 --> 03:13:30.74
They got workers rebelling, slave labor rebelling.

4848
03:13:30.74 --> 03:13:31.74
It's about time.

4849
03:13:31.74 --> 03:13:34.70
Well, that's China.

4850
03:13:34.70 --> 03:13:37.38
That's where your clothes are getting made

4851
03:13:37.38 --> 03:13:40.10
if you're not buying from originUSA.com.

4852
03:13:40.10 --> 03:13:44.10
You're enabling slave labor to happen.

4853
03:13:44.10 --> 03:13:45.78
So don't do it.

4854
03:13:45.78 --> 03:13:47.54
Get the best quality stuff.

4855
03:13:48.62 --> 03:13:50.82
Get the best quality stuff made in America.

4856
03:13:51.62 --> 03:13:53.10
Don't support slave labor.

4857
03:13:53.10 --> 03:13:55.34
That's what I got for you, originUSA.com.

4858
03:13:55.34 --> 03:13:56.18
It's true.

4859
03:13:56.18 --> 03:13:57.78
Also, Jocko's a store called Jocko's Store.

4860
03:13:57.78 --> 03:13:58.62
Did I say geese?

4861
03:13:58.62 --> 03:13:59.46
Did I say jujujuju?

4862
03:13:59.46 --> 03:14:00.30
Yeah, you do.

4863
03:14:00.30 --> 03:14:01.14
I was talking to some jujuju.

4864
03:14:01.14 --> 03:14:03.30
I was talking to someone who was like, brah.

4865
03:14:03.30 --> 03:14:05.46
When you put an origin jujutsu-gi on,

4866
03:14:06.34 --> 03:14:09.90
it's a totally different thing.

4867
03:14:09.90 --> 03:14:11.02
It's a different thing.

4868
03:14:11.02 --> 03:14:14.82
It's like you were driving in a Camry.

4869
03:14:15.90 --> 03:14:16.74
Sure.

4870
03:14:16.74 --> 03:14:18.30
No offense against Camrys, right?

4871
03:14:18.30 --> 03:14:19.66
Apparently.

4872
03:14:19.66 --> 03:14:23.06
But then you got put into a Cadillac.

4873
03:14:23.06 --> 03:14:24.02
You know what I'm saying?

4874
03:14:24.02 --> 03:14:24.86
I know what you're saying.

4875
03:14:24.86 --> 03:14:25.70
Next level.

4876
03:14:25.70 --> 03:14:26.54
It's a different thing.

4877
03:14:26.54 --> 03:14:27.62
It's a different experience.

4878
03:14:27.62 --> 03:14:28.58
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

4879
03:14:28.58 --> 03:14:31.06
Hey, your brother used to have a Prius.

4880
03:14:31.06 --> 03:14:31.90
Right?

4881
03:14:31.90 --> 03:14:32.74
Does he still have it?

4882
03:14:32.74 --> 03:14:33.58
No.

4883
03:14:33.58 --> 03:14:34.66
See, he had that Prius.

4884
03:14:34.66 --> 03:14:36.62
I didn't know what to think of a Prius, right?

4885
03:14:36.62 --> 03:14:38.06
Because I'd never been in one.

4886
03:14:38.06 --> 03:14:39.34
I got in his Prius.

4887
03:14:39.34 --> 03:14:40.18
Bro, that thing was-

4888
03:14:40.18 --> 03:14:41.02
You didn't like that?

4889
03:14:41.02 --> 03:14:42.34
No, that thing was foolish.

4890
03:14:42.34 --> 03:14:43.18
Foolish?

4891
03:14:44.38 --> 03:14:46.18
I know it gets good mileage and whatnot.

4892
03:14:46.18 --> 03:14:51.18
No, but I mean, it felt like economy class.

4893
03:14:51.34 --> 03:14:54.18
Yes, it was very economy class.

4894
03:14:54.18 --> 03:14:56.78
I'm sure there's different levels of interior of Prius.

4895
03:14:56.78 --> 03:14:57.98
I'm sure that's my assumption.

4896
03:14:57.98 --> 03:14:58.82
I don't know.

4897
03:14:58.82 --> 03:15:00.38
I don't know how many Priuses I've ever been in

4898
03:15:00.38 --> 03:15:03.34
besides his, but I think-

4899
03:15:03.34 --> 03:15:05.22
Like you hit the bump and you feel it.

4900
03:15:05.22 --> 03:15:06.66
Oh, the whole deal?

4901
03:15:06.66 --> 03:15:07.50
Yeah, you're right.

4902
03:15:07.50 --> 03:15:08.62
It's economy class.

4903
03:15:08.62 --> 03:15:09.46
Yeah, it's different.

4904
03:15:09.46 --> 03:15:10.30
It's different.

4905
03:15:10.30 --> 03:15:11.14
So don't do that, man.

4906
03:15:11.14 --> 03:15:13.22
Don't get an economy class, Guy.

4907
03:15:13.22 --> 03:15:14.06
No.

4908
03:15:14.06 --> 03:15:14.90
Get a first class, Guy.

4909
03:15:14.90 --> 03:15:15.74
Yeah.

4910
03:15:15.74 --> 03:15:17.10
Yeah, you're gonna feel the difference, for sure.

4911
03:15:17.10 --> 03:15:18.74
Especially when you gotta roll around in that thing,

4912
03:15:18.74 --> 03:15:20.18
two people trying to choke you with it.

4913
03:15:20.18 --> 03:15:21.02
You will not.

4914
03:15:21.02 --> 03:15:21.86
It's gonna make a difference.

4915
03:15:21.86 --> 03:15:23.54
Hey, if you travel first class

4916
03:15:23.54 --> 03:15:25.26
and then you go back to economy, you hate it.

4917
03:15:25.26 --> 03:15:26.10
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4918
03:15:26.10 --> 03:15:26.94
It's the same thing here.

4919
03:15:26.94 --> 03:15:29.14
You put on the origin, Guy.

4920
03:15:29.14 --> 03:15:29.98
You're in first class.

4921
03:15:29.98 --> 03:15:31.50
Then you go back into an economy, Guy.

4922
03:15:31.50 --> 03:15:32.34
You're gonna hate it.

4923
03:15:32.34 --> 03:15:33.18
It's gonna be pretty much the same.

4924
03:15:33.18 --> 03:15:34.38
And once again, you're also gonna know

4925
03:15:34.38 --> 03:15:39.38
in your subconscious mind that a 14-year-old girl

4926
03:15:39.62 --> 03:15:43.50
in a slavery position was forced to make your Guy

4927
03:15:43.50 --> 03:15:44.74
at gunpoint.

4928
03:15:44.74 --> 03:15:45.86
14 hours a day.

4929
03:15:45.86 --> 03:15:46.90
14 hours a day.

4930
03:15:46.90 --> 03:15:48.42
Yeah, damn.

4931
03:15:48.42 --> 03:15:51.50
So just keep that in mind, originUSA.com.

4932
03:15:51.50 --> 03:15:53.46
Yeah, on that.

4933
03:15:53.46 --> 03:15:55.70
Also, Joggle Store, if you wanna represent on the past,

4934
03:15:55.70 --> 03:15:59.38
discipline equals freedom, shirts and hats.

4935
03:15:59.38 --> 03:16:00.62
March, if you will.

4936
03:16:00.62 --> 03:16:01.74
This is quality though.

4937
03:16:01.74 --> 03:16:04.86
It's not like the cheap, free, I made it very wearable.

4938
03:16:04.86 --> 03:16:06.46
We made it very wearable.

4939
03:16:06.46 --> 03:16:07.30
Actually, a lot of people say

4940
03:16:07.30 --> 03:16:09.66
it's their favorite fitting shirt.

4941
03:16:09.66 --> 03:16:11.14
Shirt locker.

4942
03:16:11.14 --> 03:16:12.50
Shirt locker is a different thing.

4943
03:16:12.50 --> 03:16:13.42
Same quality.

4944
03:16:13.42 --> 03:16:14.66
Same quality, kind of.

4945
03:16:14.66 --> 03:16:15.66
Custom, sure.

4946
03:16:15.66 --> 03:16:16.58
Yeah, they are custom.

4947
03:16:16.58 --> 03:16:17.86
But yes, this subscription,

4948
03:16:17.86 --> 03:16:18.94

4949
03:16:18.94 --> 03:16:19.78
Cool designs.

4950
03:16:19.78 --> 03:16:21.62
A lot of people seem to like that one as well.

4951
03:16:21.62 --> 03:16:23.22
So yeah, this is all on Joggle Store.com.

4952
03:16:23.22 --> 03:16:25.78
There's a couple comment that I'm pretty,

4953
03:16:25.78 --> 03:16:27.02
I'm pretty on board with the plan

4954
03:16:27.02 --> 03:16:29.30
for some of the t-shirts in the shirt locker

4955
03:16:29.30 --> 03:16:30.38
that are coming out.

4956
03:16:30.38 --> 03:16:31.70
Yeah.

Look, there's stuff going on with the platforms right now.

4960
03:16:36.30 --> 03:16:38.66
It's actually crazy to watch.

4961
03:16:38.66 --> 03:16:39.86
What's going on?

4962
03:16:39.86 --> 03:16:44.86
Social media, big tech companies, freedom of speech.

4963
03:16:44.90 --> 03:16:46.50
There's all kinds of mayhem going on.

4964
03:16:46.50 --> 03:16:48.70
Look, we gotta have a contingency plan.

4965
03:16:48.70 --> 03:16:51.86
We, meaning you, listening, us sitting here.

4966
03:16:51.86 --> 03:16:52.90
Contingency plan.

Joggle Underground.com.

4968
03:16:55.10 --> 03:16:59.06
If everything falls apart, we'll be there.

4969
03:16:59.06 --> 03:17:00.86
It's $8.18 a month.

4970
03:17:00.86 --> 03:17:02.98
If you can't afford it, that's okay.

4971

But listen, we don't know what's gonna happen

4974
03:17:08.58 --> 03:17:10.38
with these platforms.

4975
03:17:10.38 --> 03:17:15.22
And we can't just, look, you can't put your trust.

4976
03:17:16.70 --> 03:17:19.14
You can't put complete trust into something

4977
03:17:19.14 --> 03:17:20.58
you have no control over.

4978
03:17:20.58 --> 03:17:22.54
You have to control your destiny.

4979
03:17:22.54 --> 03:17:24.30
You have to take ownership of your future.

4980
03:17:24.30 --> 03:17:26.54
So look, if everything, look, if we can stay on this path,

4981
03:17:26.54 --> 03:17:27.62
cool, hey, we're down.

4982
03:17:27.62 --> 03:17:30.18
We're, yeah, it's fine.

4983
03:17:30.18 --> 03:17:31.54
If they wanna let us keep talking

4984
03:17:31.54 --> 03:17:33.02
and we'll keep talking and we're all good,

4985
03:17:33.02 --> 03:17:34.82
hey, we got no problem with that.

4986
03:17:34.82 --> 03:17:36.86
But I can't just rely on that.

4987
03:17:36.86 --> 03:17:41.82
We all can't just rely on the benevolence

4988
03:17:41.82 --> 03:17:44.14
of these people that have no vested interest

4989
03:17:44.14 --> 03:17:44.98
in what we're doing.

4990
03:17:44.98 --> 03:17:46.82
In fact, sometimes it could be conceived

4991
03:17:46.82 --> 03:17:48.18
that they have a vested interest

4992
03:17:48.18 --> 03:17:49.90
in not supporting what we're doing.

4993
03:17:49.90 --> 03:17:50.82
I'm just saying.

4994
03:17:51.90 --> 03:17:54.26

We got a leadership consultancy.

5003
03:18:13.70 --> 03:18:15.54
This is one of the things that we do there

5004
03:18:15.54 --> 03:18:17.74
is these battlefield tours, EF battlefields.

5005
03:18:17.74 --> 03:18:20.70
Next one is March 21st through the 23rd.

5006
03:18:20.70 --> 03:18:21.90
It's up in Gettysburg.

5007
03:18:21.90 --> 03:18:26.90
It is going to impact the way you think

5008
03:18:27.30 --> 03:18:31.62
and it's gonna impact your understanding of the world.

5009
03:18:31.62 --> 03:18:32.86
If you come out to that.

5010
03:18:33.86 --> 03:18:35.10
It impacts me every time.

Years ago, this wasn't even conceivable thing.

5017
03:18:52.66 --> 03:18:55.98
It would just seem like, oh, how can you learn something

5018
03:18:55.98 --> 03:18:58.46
over the internet?

5019
03:18:58.46 --> 03:19:01.50
But Echo Charles, you know those videos that you make?

5020
03:19:01.50 --> 03:19:02.34
Yeah, I do.

5021
03:19:02.34 --> 03:19:03.18
Where'd you learn how to do that?

5022
03:19:03.18 --> 03:19:04.02
Mostly the internet.

5023
03:19:04.02 --> 03:19:04.86

5024
03:19:05.86 --> 03:19:09.10
A lot of on the job training as well.

Well, you don't feel, sorry, in the field.

5026
03:19:11.50 --> 03:19:12.70
Where'd the knowledge come from?

5027
03:19:12.70 --> 03:19:13.82
Oh yeah, the internet.

5045
03:19:50.66 --> 03:19:53.46
theomna, O-M-N-A,

5046
03:19:53.46 --> 03:19:58.34
theomna.com on Instagram,

5047
03:19:58.34 --> 03:20:01.78
O-M-N-A underscore, underscore.

5048
03:20:02.78 --> 03:20:03.62
Oh yeah.

5049
03:20:03.62 --> 03:20:06.62
International, Facebook, O-M-N-A.

5050
03:20:06.62 --> 03:20:08.22
You just call it omna, huh?

5051
03:20:08.22 --> 03:20:09.82
Yes. You made it into a word.

5052
03:20:09.82 --> 03:20:10.82
Yeah, it's omna.

5053
03:20:10.82 --> 03:20:12.66
One man national asset.

5054
03:20:12.66 --> 03:20:14.66
Everybody is a national asset.

5055
03:20:14.66 --> 03:20:16.98
This starts as like a tongue in cheek thing though, right?

5056
03:20:16.98 --> 03:20:19.70
Like hey, that guy thinks he's a one man national asset.

5057
03:20:19.70 --> 03:20:20.86
He's theomna.

5058
03:20:20.86 --> 03:20:24.42
But then it becomes,

5059
03:20:25.86 --> 03:20:27.70
on the battlefield in business and life,

5060
03:20:27.70 --> 03:20:32.70
everyone's job is critical to a team's success.

5061
03:20:33.10 --> 03:20:33.94
Yeah, everybody.

5062
03:20:33.94 --> 03:20:35.46
So there you go.

5063
03:20:35.46 --> 03:20:38.82
As far as Echo and I were also on Twitter,

5064
03:20:38.82 --> 03:20:39.98
Twitter's hot right now.

5065
03:20:39.98 --> 03:20:41.10
You know that?

5066
03:20:41.10 --> 03:20:44.94
Hey, Echo Charles lost all of his Twitter followers

5067
03:20:44.94 --> 03:20:46.90
because he got stolen.

5068
03:20:46.90 --> 03:20:48.42
How did somebody steal that from you?

5069
03:20:48.42 --> 03:20:50.30
Did you get fished or something?

5070
03:20:50.30 --> 03:20:52.58
Yeah, probably clicked on something.

5071
03:20:52.58 --> 03:20:54.38
It happened that quick, huh?

5072
03:20:54.38 --> 03:20:57.78
Yeah, well, I didn't really go on Twitter that much,

5073
03:20:57.78 --> 03:21:00.54
so maybe I clicked on one of these lists.

5074
03:21:00.54 --> 03:21:02.26
What kind of lists?

5075
03:21:02.26 --> 03:21:04.82
You know, like 10 things you should avoid

5076
03:21:04.82 --> 03:21:07.86
when you go to, I don't know, Russia or something.

5077
03:21:07.86 --> 03:21:08.70
I don't know.

5078
03:21:08.70 --> 03:21:09.54
You know, they have those lists.

5079
03:21:09.54 --> 03:21:10.74
I always click on them.

5080
03:21:10.74 --> 03:21:12.78
Okay, so these are clickbait.

5081
03:21:12.78 --> 03:21:13.78
You're on the internet.

5082
03:21:13.78 --> 03:21:15.22
You're surfing the interweb.

5083
03:21:15.22 --> 03:21:16.74
Yeah, and then it's like,

5084
03:21:16.74 --> 03:21:18.02
Is it inside of Twitter?

5085
03:21:18.02 --> 03:21:18.94
This is what it'll do.

5086
03:21:18.94 --> 03:21:19.78
Here's a heads up.

5087
03:21:19.78 --> 03:21:22.38
It'll be something along the lines of this.

5088
03:21:22.38 --> 03:21:24.26
And it's totally my fault.

5089
03:21:24.26 --> 03:21:28.02
Where they'll be like, oh, go back to Twitter.

5090
03:21:28.02 --> 03:21:29.58
You know, like you'll go on the website.

5091
03:21:29.58 --> 03:21:31.66
It'll be all messy website or whatever.

5092
03:21:31.66 --> 03:21:33.62
I'm usually pretty good at navigating it,

5093
03:21:33.62 --> 03:21:35.82
but then it'll be like, oh, navigate back to Twitter.

5094
03:21:35.82 --> 03:21:36.66
So you go back.

5095
03:21:36.66 --> 03:21:39.70
Wait, you clicked on 10 things to avoid in Russia.

5096
03:21:39.70 --> 03:21:40.54
Yeah, I'll read it.

5097
03:21:40.54 --> 03:21:43.94
It comes up, there's 19 pop up ads.

5098
03:21:43.94 --> 03:21:46.02
There's a bunch of weird shit going on that thing.

5099
03:21:46.02 --> 03:21:48.22
You maybe even got a little flag warning that came up

5100
03:21:48.22 --> 03:21:49.42
that this is a corrupt scenario.

5101
03:21:49.42 --> 03:21:50.26
Probably, yeah.

5102
03:21:50.26 --> 03:21:51.18
You just ignored all that.

5103
03:21:51.18 --> 03:21:52.38
You read the 10 things.

5104
03:21:52.38 --> 03:21:55.70
Maybe we should do an underground podcast

5105
03:21:55.70 --> 03:21:57.02
about the 10 things to avoid in Russia.

5106
03:21:57.02 --> 03:21:58.34
Since we did get the knowledge we paid for.

5107
03:21:58.34 --> 03:21:59.18
I don't know.

5108
03:21:59.18 --> 03:22:00.70
Yeah, there's a list of some sort.

5109
03:22:00.70 --> 03:22:03.18
So then it says, do you want to return to Twitter?

5110
03:22:03.18 --> 03:22:04.50
Navigate back to Twitter.

5111
03:22:04.50 --> 03:22:08.14
And then you go and then like, if I'm not mistaken,

5112
03:22:08.14 --> 03:22:11.46
it'll say like, oh, you're like logged out

5113
03:22:11.46 --> 03:22:12.42
or something like that.

5114
03:22:12.42 --> 03:22:13.70
So you log back in.

5115
03:22:13.70 --> 03:22:17.54
Oh, bro.

5116
03:22:17.54 --> 03:22:19.50
If I remember, it was something along those lines.

5117
03:22:19.50 --> 03:22:20.50
Russia, you, you.

5118
03:22:20.50 --> 03:22:22.82
It'll be like confirm or I don't know, something like that.

5119
03:22:22.82 --> 03:22:24.26
Bro, you, yeah, yeah.

5120
03:22:24.26 --> 03:22:25.10
You messed up.

5121
03:22:25.10 --> 03:22:26.94
Yeah, I walked right into it.

5122
03:22:26.94 --> 03:22:29.30
And then my account is just gone.

5123
03:22:29.30 --> 03:22:30.94
They go and then they change your username,

5124
03:22:30.94 --> 03:22:31.86
your password, everything.

5125
03:22:31.86 --> 03:22:35.02
So your email doesn't even show up as the account.

5126
03:22:35.02 --> 03:22:37.38
So I'm like, whatever, it's just Twitter.

5127
03:22:37.38 --> 03:22:40.14
And then like maybe a week or two later,

5128
03:22:40.14 --> 03:22:41.74
people are like messaging me like,

5129
03:22:41.74 --> 03:22:43.34
hey, someone hacked your Twitter.

5130
03:22:43.34 --> 03:22:45.14
So I'm like, you know, whatever.

5131
03:22:45.14 --> 03:22:47.74
And then that day with me and you,

5132
03:22:47.74 --> 03:22:48.66
I went and looked for it.

5133
03:22:48.66 --> 03:22:49.50
It was just gone.

5134
03:22:49.50 --> 03:22:50.34
Everything was gone.

5135
03:22:50.34 --> 03:22:51.94
So I just signed up under my original name.

5136
03:22:51.94 --> 03:22:52.78
It was available.

5137
03:22:52.78 --> 03:22:55.26
So what, how many followers did you have?

5138
03:22:55.26 --> 03:22:57.02
Do you know how many followers did you have?

5139
03:22:57.02 --> 03:22:59.86
Well, like, I don't know, 70 something thousand.

5140
03:22:59.86 --> 03:23:01.30
70,000.

5141
03:23:01.30 --> 03:23:02.54
And now how many do you have?

5142
03:23:02.54 --> 03:23:03.38
70?

5143
03:23:03.38 --> 03:23:04.94
Yeah, something like that.

5144
03:23:04.94 --> 03:23:05.78
But you're bummed out.

5145
03:23:05.78 --> 03:23:07.62
You're sad because the rock, then the rock follow you.

5146
03:23:07.62 --> 03:23:08.90
No, no, no, Joe Rogan.

5147
03:23:08.90 --> 03:23:11.86
Joe Rogan followed you on Twitter and now he's gone.

5148
03:23:11.86 --> 03:23:13.74
Yeah, brutal, brutal.

5149
03:23:13.74 --> 03:23:14.82
Well, you still follow me now.

5150
03:23:14.82 --> 03:23:15.66
So that's cool.

5151
03:23:15.66 --> 03:23:17.34
I think I was, I think I might have been your first.

5152
03:23:17.34 --> 03:23:18.70
Oh, I was your first follower.

5153
03:23:18.70 --> 03:23:19.62
Yeah, you were literally.

5154
03:23:19.62 --> 03:23:20.70
There you go.

5155
03:23:20.70 --> 03:23:23.78
Anyways, if you want to follow Echo Charles

5156
03:23:23.78 --> 03:23:26.26
on the, on the Twitter, on the gram, on the Facebook,

5157
03:23:26.26 --> 03:23:29.42
I'm on there too, at Echo Charles and at Jocko willing.

5158
03:23:29.42 --> 03:23:30.86
Watch out.

5159
03:23:30.86 --> 03:23:31.94
Watch out for the algorithm.

5160
03:23:31.94 --> 03:23:34.86
Number one, number two, watch out for the hackers.

5161
03:23:34.86 --> 03:23:36.58
You know, that stuff.

5162
03:23:36.58 --> 03:23:38.38
JD, anything else?

5163
03:23:38.38 --> 03:23:39.90
No, I'm good.

5164
03:23:39.90 --> 03:23:40.98
Right, all man.

5165
03:23:40.98 --> 03:23:42.58
Well, thanks for coming down.

5166
03:23:42.58 --> 03:23:43.90
Appreciate it.

5167
03:23:43.90 --> 03:23:46.54
More important, thanks for your service in the Marine Corps.

5168
03:23:46.54 --> 03:23:49.70
Teaching Marines how to fight, teaching them how to lead.

5169
03:23:49.70 --> 03:23:52.62
It's been an honor working with you past few years

5170
03:23:52.62 --> 03:23:55.42
and I look forward to doing more in the future.

5171
03:23:56.54 --> 03:23:59.14
Thanks to all our military and tonight,

5172
03:23:59.14 --> 03:24:00.70
especially to our Marines.

5173
03:24:02.22 --> 03:24:04.50
Thank you for holding the line around the world

5174
03:24:04.50 --> 03:24:07.54
to protect and preserve our way of life.

5175
03:24:07.54 --> 03:24:09.74
And the same goes for all our police and law enforcement,

5176
03:24:09.74 --> 03:24:12.34
firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

5177
03:24:12.34 --> 03:24:15.26
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service,

5178
03:24:15.26 --> 03:24:17.34
all first responders.

5179
03:24:17.34 --> 03:24:19.82
We're only able to live the way we do

5180
03:24:20.82 --> 03:24:24.82
because you live your life and sacrifice the way you do.

5181
03:24:24.82 --> 03:24:25.92
So thank you.

5182
03:24:27.18 --> 03:24:28.46
And everyone else out there,

5183
03:24:28.46 --> 03:24:31.38
remember what the Marine Corps says.

5184
03:24:31.38 --> 03:24:35.22
That while physical health and strength and well-being

5185
03:24:35.22 --> 03:24:37.02
is important and it certainly is.

5186
03:24:38.22 --> 03:24:39.58
It certainly is.

5187
03:24:40.58 --> 03:24:43.86
But remember that the principal weapon is the mind.

5188
03:24:45.66 --> 03:24:50.06
So read, study, learn and of course,

5189
03:24:50.06 --> 03:24:51.66
keep getting after it.

5190
03:24:51.66 --> 03:24:55.46
And until next time, this is JD and Echo and Jaco.

5191
03:24:55.46 --> 03:25:01.30
Out.
