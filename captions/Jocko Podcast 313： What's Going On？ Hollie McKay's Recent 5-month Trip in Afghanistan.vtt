1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.16
This is Jocopont Gas number 313.

2
00:00:03.16 --> 00:00:05.80
With echo Charles and me, Jocobo-Willink.

3
00:00:05.80 --> 00:00:07.28
Good evening, echo good evening.

4
00:00:08.68 --> 00:00:12.32
He looks like any other ordinary young afghan,

5
00:00:12.32 --> 00:00:15.72
a dusting of a dark beard, sun-leathered face,

6
00:00:15.72 --> 00:00:18.72
a small child that clinging to his side.

7
00:00:18.72 --> 00:00:23.96
Only Nazifula 24 is a proud member of afghan's

8
00:00:23.96 --> 00:00:28.96
ISIS affiliate known as ISIS K or informally

9
00:00:28.96 --> 00:00:30.76
as dash.

10
00:00:31.76 --> 00:00:35.56
He has long been wanted by everyone from US troops

11
00:00:35.56 --> 00:00:38.56
and the now defunct afghan security forces

12
00:00:38.56 --> 00:00:42.76
and the Taliban, formally known as the Islamic Emirate

13
00:00:42.76 --> 00:00:44.16
of Afghanistan.

14
00:00:45.16 --> 00:00:48.56
Nostrulla says he joined the terrorist group

15
00:00:48.56 --> 00:00:51.56
around five years ago out of frustration

16
00:00:51.56 --> 00:00:54.76
that the Taliban was dishonest about the status

17
00:00:54.76 --> 00:00:57.16
of its shadowy leader.

18
00:00:57.16 --> 00:01:00.12
We kept asking the Taliban to show us

19
00:01:00.12 --> 00:01:03.96
video of Mullah Omar, but we couldn't get any claims.

20
00:01:03.96 --> 00:01:06.96
That is why the dash here was created.

21
00:01:06.96 --> 00:01:11.24
They seemed truthful and said they were going

22
00:01:11.24 --> 00:01:12.96
to implement Sharia law.

23
00:01:12.96 --> 00:01:15.16
So that is why I joined them.

24
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:19.76
Taliban founder Omar died in 2013,

25
00:01:19.76 --> 00:01:22.36
yet it was kept secret for more than two years.

26
00:01:22.36 --> 00:01:25.48
Most ISIS K recruits are believed to have

27
00:01:25.48 --> 00:01:28.08
defected from Taliban branches in Afghanistan

28
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:31.36
and neighboring Pakistan seeking an even more extreme

29
00:01:31.36 --> 00:01:34.80
interpretation of Islam with more international

30
00:01:34.80 --> 00:01:38.48
rather than domestic centered goals of caliphate control.

31
00:01:39.88 --> 00:01:43.04
Since then, the terrorist outfit has attracted a wealth

32
00:01:43.04 --> 00:01:48.04
of foreign recruits bent on attacking NATO, Afghan forces,

33
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:51.68
and the insurgency turned Taliban government.

34
00:01:51.68 --> 00:01:56.68
Since the Emirate came to power on August 15,

35
00:01:56.68 --> 00:02:00.88
ISIS K has waged a deadly spat of suicide attacks

36
00:02:00.88 --> 00:02:03.28
and targeted bombings across multiple provinces

37
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:05.28
and claimed dozens of lives.

38
00:02:06.88 --> 00:02:09.48
While some assaults have targeted the Taliban,

39
00:02:09.48 --> 00:02:13.28
the vast majority have been inflicted upon innocent civilians,

40
00:02:13.28 --> 00:02:17.28
particularly the minority Shiite population.

41
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:22.28
Nazifula says he is unclear how many ISIS K members

42
00:02:23.48 --> 00:02:25.48
are hidden inside Afghanistan.

43
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:29.40
He spent the last year locked away in the country's

44
00:02:29.40 --> 00:02:33.60
notorious Bagram prison, having been arrested by the previous

45
00:02:33.60 --> 00:02:36.68
Afghan government for his ISIS membership.

46
00:02:38.28 --> 00:02:42.60
However, when the Taliban swept to power in August,

47
00:02:42.60 --> 00:02:44.000
he says he was released.

48
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Even though the new regime was aware of his checkered past,

49
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.84
Nazifula went straight back to the black-clad terror clan,

50
00:02:53.84 --> 00:02:56.12
but says he has since broken his leg,

51
00:02:56.12 --> 00:02:59.56
seemingly from an accidental discharge from his own rifle.

52
00:03:00.64 --> 00:03:03.80
Yet he remains ready to take up arms again

53
00:03:03.80 --> 00:03:06.96
with a very specific goal in mind.

54
00:03:08.32 --> 00:03:11.24
Our first target is to destroy Pakistan

55
00:03:11.24 --> 00:03:14.52
because the main reason for everything in Afghanistan

56
00:03:14.52 --> 00:03:15.52
is Pakistan.

57
00:03:15.52 --> 00:03:19.40
He vows, when the Taliban were here,

58
00:03:19.40 --> 00:03:22.68
they were saying that we control 80% of the country,

59
00:03:22.68 --> 00:03:26.12
but they were not implementing Islamic rulings.

60
00:03:26.12 --> 00:03:31.12
That's why we stood up in when we started ISIS K over in this area.

61
00:03:33.64 --> 00:03:38.64
Nazifula continues, then in the parcel under their dominance,

62
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:43.52
the outfit immediately began, quote, implementing Islamic rulings

63
00:03:43.52 --> 00:03:46.12
like cutting hands and everything.

64
00:03:48.72 --> 00:03:51.76
So that's when the Taliban got funding from Pakistan

65
00:03:51.76 --> 00:03:54.72
and started fighting us back, he claims with a big smile.

66
00:03:56.28 --> 00:04:01.20
And at that time, Baghdad announced the caliphate in our area

67
00:04:01.20 --> 00:04:02.40
and we were on top.

68
00:04:03.92 --> 00:04:05.68
That's why we are against the Taliban.

69
00:04:05.68 --> 00:04:10.68
Although Nazifula asserts that his outlawed group is, quote,

70
00:04:12.44 --> 00:04:16.04
week now and attempts to downplay their leethality,

71
00:04:16.04 --> 00:04:19.88
their hard-line goals remain firmly in place.

72
00:04:21.16 --> 00:04:23.80
We want to implement Sharia law.

73
00:04:23.80 --> 00:04:26.60
We want to implement the way our prophet was living,

74
00:04:26.60 --> 00:04:30.80
the way he was clothed, the dressing his job was there.

75
00:04:31.80 --> 00:04:34.68
Currently, we don't have much to fight,

76
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:36.64
but if you give me anything,

77
00:04:36.64 --> 00:04:38.84
I am going to fight Pakistan now.

78
00:04:41.64 --> 00:04:45.12
Yet hauntingly, Nazifula also makes it clear

79
00:04:45.12 --> 00:04:49.04
that ISIS K has far more global reaching ambitions.

80
00:04:50.12 --> 00:04:53.48
Whoever goes against Islam and against the Quran,

81
00:04:53.48 --> 00:04:58.000
he adds darkly, we are against them.

82
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And that is an article from mknews.com.

83
00:05:08.40 --> 00:05:11.80
The article is written by Holly McKay.

84
00:05:11.80 --> 00:05:16.48
Holly is a journalist, she's an author, she's a war reporter,

85
00:05:16.48 --> 00:05:20.88
and she is an extremely courageous human being.

86
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:25.36
She's been on this podcast before number 271,

87
00:05:25.36 --> 00:05:29.80
where she talked about her experiences in the war against ISIS

88
00:05:29.80 --> 00:05:32.28
in Iraq and Syria, which she chronicled

89
00:05:32.28 --> 00:05:37.28
in her incredible book, which is called Only Cry for the Living.

90
00:05:38.64 --> 00:05:40.64
And she's back with us again tonight to share

91
00:05:40.64 --> 00:05:44.32
with us her experiences from Afghanistan.

92
00:05:44.32 --> 00:05:46.04
Because she was there, she was there

93
00:05:46.04 --> 00:05:51.04
during the American departure, the collapse of the government

94
00:05:51.04 --> 00:05:54.96
and the rise to power and control of the Taliban.

95
00:05:56.52 --> 00:05:58.48
So Holly, welcome back.

96
00:05:58.48 --> 00:06:03.48
And I do mean that sincerely I was watching

97
00:06:03.48 --> 00:06:06.56
through social media when you were in Afghanistan,

98
00:06:06.56 --> 00:06:09.24
and I was terribly worried about you.

99
00:06:10.16 --> 00:06:12.68
And we'll discuss why, I'm sure we'll get to some of that.

100
00:06:12.68 --> 00:06:15.84
It was definitely sketchy to say the least,

101
00:06:15.84 --> 00:06:19.76
but for now, I am truly glad that you are here.

102
00:06:19.76 --> 00:06:24.76
And you went there for a reason to learn to capture

103
00:06:25.08 --> 00:06:26.84
what was happening, and you've done that.

104
00:06:26.84 --> 00:06:30.60
So let's talk about what you've been through

105
00:06:30.60 --> 00:06:31.72
first of all, welcome back.

106
00:06:31.72 --> 00:06:33.76
Thank you, thank you for having me.

107
00:06:33.76 --> 00:06:36.24
Strange adjusting, so it's been a few days

108
00:06:36.24 --> 00:06:39.12
and I'm still getting used to, no, you know,

109
00:06:39.12 --> 00:06:42.32
highway without bombed and pop holes.

110
00:06:42.32 --> 00:06:45.12
And like, oh, this is a nice road, hang on a minute.

111
00:06:45.12 --> 00:06:46.44
Yeah.

112
00:06:46.44 --> 00:06:50.48
Just to set the stage a little bit to bring you into Afghanistan

113
00:06:50.48 --> 00:06:53.16
when you went back, when you went to Afghanistan this time,

114
00:06:53.16 --> 00:06:56.64
just to get where what you stepped into,

115
00:06:57.60 --> 00:07:02.60
July 2nd, Germany and Italy withdraw from Afghanistan,

116
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.40
that is the same time that America quietly

117
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:11.52
and strangely left Bogramar base.

118
00:07:11.52 --> 00:07:16.28
July 8th, Biden announces that the war is gonna be over

119
00:07:16.28 --> 00:07:19.04
and we're gonna be out by August 31st,

120
00:07:19.04 --> 00:07:24.44
July 12th, General Miller, who is the commander of US

121
00:07:24.44 --> 00:07:26.96
and NATO forces in Afghanistan, he steps down.

122
00:07:27.96 --> 00:07:31.88
And by the way, this is right as Taliban

123
00:07:31.88 --> 00:07:33.76
is seizing district after district.

124
00:07:33.76 --> 00:07:38.76
By mid-July, they had seized, you know, 140 or 150 districts

125
00:07:38.76 --> 00:07:43.76
inside of Afghanistan, July 21st, General Milley reports

126
00:07:47.16 --> 00:07:50.20
that have the districts in Afghanistan

127
00:07:50.20 --> 00:07:51.72
are under Taliban control.

128
00:07:53.48 --> 00:07:58.48
So July 22nd, the US House of Representatives,

129
00:07:58.48 --> 00:08:02.28
they pass a bill for visas for our interpreters

130
00:08:02.28 --> 00:08:04.76
and other allies that were there.

131
00:08:04.76 --> 00:08:05.96
And the reason I bring that up is

132
00:08:05.96 --> 00:08:07.28
because that turned into a big deal

133
00:08:07.28 --> 00:08:09.48
as everything shut down.

134
00:08:09.48 --> 00:08:12.28
And so that's what we're going into.

135
00:08:12.28 --> 00:08:15.04
It's very obvious, I forget the quote from General Milley

136
00:08:15.04 --> 00:08:16.96
but it was something along the lines of

137
00:08:18.36 --> 00:08:22.16
everyone was surprised at how fast it was collapsing

138
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:23.52
but it was collapsing quick.

139
00:08:23.52 --> 00:08:27.96
So August 7th is when you arrive in Kabul.

140
00:08:29.32 --> 00:08:32.000
What was your purpose in going there?

141
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.04
Did you know how fast it was falling down?

142
00:08:34.04 --> 00:08:35.52
Did you like, hey, this isn't gonna make it?

143
00:08:35.52 --> 00:08:37.68
I'm gonna go in there anyways.

144
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:38.52
What was that?

145
00:08:38.52 --> 00:08:39.36
What was the thought processor?

146
00:08:39.36 --> 00:08:40.68
So I made the decision.

147
00:08:40.68 --> 00:08:42.12
I think it was around May June

148
00:08:42.12 --> 00:08:44.48
that I was going to go back in August.

149
00:08:44.48 --> 00:08:46.88
With my photographer, Jake, who's Australian,

150
00:08:46.88 --> 00:08:48.24
who's also spent a lot of time,

151
00:08:48.24 --> 00:08:50.32
he lived in Afghanistan and spent a lot of time

152
00:08:50.32 --> 00:08:51.32
in other places.

153
00:08:51.32 --> 00:08:54.72
So we thought we would go back and document

154
00:08:54.72 --> 00:08:57.84
what I thought was going to be the last month

155
00:08:57.84 --> 00:08:59.24
of the Americans being there

156
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:02.20
and then the Afghan government trying to stand

157
00:09:02.20 --> 00:09:03.64
on its own two feet.

158
00:09:03.64 --> 00:09:07.68
So between making that decision and what happened,

159
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:10.48
it just, you couldn't, I just,

160
00:09:10.48 --> 00:09:14.08
I did not realize it was going to happen that quickly.

161
00:09:14.08 --> 00:09:17.04
And so when I arrived, even that first week,

162
00:09:17.04 --> 00:09:19.04
I was going to meetings at NDS,

163
00:09:19.04 --> 00:09:20.48
which is the Afghan intelligence,

164
00:09:20.48 --> 00:09:22.60
I was going to meet with all these different people

165
00:09:22.60 --> 00:09:25.16
and everybody was just so convinced

166
00:09:25.16 --> 00:09:27.52
that it wasn't going to fall immediately,

167
00:09:27.52 --> 00:09:30.40
at least not within say that month.

168
00:09:30.40 --> 00:09:34.44
And so the speed of that and I've had to do so much

169
00:09:34.44 --> 00:09:36.000
reflection on this and looking back

170
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.32
and going where did you miscalculate?

171
00:09:38.32 --> 00:09:41.08
How did this sort of happen so quickly?

172
00:09:41.08 --> 00:09:43.36
And it really just goes to show,

173
00:09:45.08 --> 00:09:48.16
I think nobody really had any idea at the end of the day.

174
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:53.16
I think there were sort of intelligence failures

175
00:09:53.16 --> 00:09:56.28
on many different levels from many different parts of it.

176
00:09:56.28 --> 00:09:59.48
I've talked about some of this.

177
00:09:59.48 --> 00:10:03.12
If I'm a company commander

178
00:10:03.12 --> 00:10:07.28
and I'm in charge of training Afghan forces,

179
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:09.60
I want to do a good job.

180
00:10:09.60 --> 00:10:13.60
And when I report to my battalion commander

181
00:10:13.60 --> 00:10:14.76
and I, you know, the first,

182
00:10:14.76 --> 00:10:16.72
I'm working with these guys for a month

183
00:10:16.72 --> 00:10:18.72
and, you know, he says, how are those guys?

184
00:10:18.72 --> 00:10:20.96
And I say, well, they got some work to do.

185
00:10:20.96 --> 00:10:22.20
They're not that great.

186
00:10:22.20 --> 00:10:23.16
They're deficient here.

187
00:10:23.16 --> 00:10:23.96
They're deficient there.

188
00:10:23.96 --> 00:10:25.36
They're not good at this.

189
00:10:25.36 --> 00:10:27.40
And my battalion commander says, okay, well,

190
00:10:27.40 --> 00:10:29.68
you know, get them squared away.

191
00:10:29.68 --> 00:10:32.44
The next month, what do I say?

192
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:34.64
You know, I'm gonna tend to say,

193
00:10:34.64 --> 00:10:37.16
what make some improvements,

194
00:10:37.16 --> 00:10:38.52
what we're doing a little bit better,

195
00:10:38.52 --> 00:10:40.40
we've got them issued better gear,

196
00:10:40.40 --> 00:10:43.92
we got the supply issues taken care of that we were worried about,

197
00:10:43.92 --> 00:10:46.92
we did a live fire training operation.

198
00:10:46.92 --> 00:10:51.92
And so you end up just by virtue of having a positive attitude

199
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:56.16
which Americans certainly have, we end up

200
00:10:58.28 --> 00:11:01.76
painting a better picture than what is actually happening.

201
00:11:01.76 --> 00:11:05.76
I saw this, I tried to think if I did this,

202
00:11:05.76 --> 00:11:06.84
I believe I did.

203
00:11:06.84 --> 00:11:09.96
I believe that I did in training Iraqi forces

204
00:11:09.96 --> 00:11:12.88
would sometimes say, you know,

205
00:11:12.88 --> 00:11:17.44
I would put some lipstick on on the situation a little bit.

206
00:11:17.44 --> 00:11:19.76
Again, trying to have a positive attitude,

207
00:11:19.76 --> 00:11:21.76
trying to look at the brightest

208
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:22.84
side of what was happening.

209
00:11:22.84 --> 00:11:28.84
And there was times in Iraq where the Iraqis would take over

210
00:11:29.44 --> 00:11:33.28
a position and the insurgents would immediately attack it

211
00:11:33.28 --> 00:11:34.56
and crush them.

212
00:11:34.56 --> 00:11:36.88
And so we got put in check a few times.

213
00:11:36.88 --> 00:11:39.000
I would almost say luckily,

214
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.88
because that what that caused us to do

215
00:11:40.88 --> 00:11:43.12
was to be very honest about the capabilities

216
00:11:43.12 --> 00:11:44.60
that people we were working with.

217
00:11:44.60 --> 00:11:48.60
So there is actual times where the Iraqis would take over,

218
00:11:48.60 --> 00:11:51.56
let's say, a checkpoint.

219
00:11:51.56 --> 00:11:52.72
We'd say, yep, they're good to go.

220
00:11:52.72 --> 00:11:54.64
And this is what I say, we, I mean, coalition forces

221
00:11:54.64 --> 00:11:56.88
in general, you know, the Americans that are there said,

222
00:11:56.88 --> 00:11:58.44
yes, we've been working with these Iraqis.

223
00:11:58.44 --> 00:12:00.04
They can handle this checkpoint.

224
00:12:00.04 --> 00:12:02.20
We'd step away from the checkpoint.

225
00:12:02.20 --> 00:12:05.96
And this happened almost immediately upon my arrival.

226
00:12:05.96 --> 00:12:08.84
This checkpoint got taken over by the Iraqis

227
00:12:08.84 --> 00:12:12.36
and the insurgents attacked it a day later, two days later.

228
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:15.04
They killed the American advisor.

229
00:12:15.04 --> 00:12:15.88
That was there.

230
00:12:15.88 --> 00:12:18.20
Actually, two American advisors that were there overran.

231
00:12:18.20 --> 00:12:19.60
It was total disaster.

232
00:12:19.60 --> 00:12:21.44
And that happened when I first showed up.

233
00:12:21.44 --> 00:12:25.04
So it really put us in check in terms of,

234
00:12:25.04 --> 00:12:27.84
okay, what we need to be very cautious about

235
00:12:27.84 --> 00:12:29.40
what we report up the chain of command

236
00:12:29.40 --> 00:12:31.88
and when they're actually ready.

237
00:12:31.88 --> 00:12:36.08
But at the same time, you know, my guess is,

238
00:12:36.08 --> 00:12:39.16
and even when we left Iraq, I was very worried.

239
00:12:39.16 --> 00:12:41.40
I was very worried when America left Iraq,

240
00:12:41.40 --> 00:12:44.36
when coalition forces left Iraq, I thought to myself,

241
00:12:44.36 --> 00:12:46.84
they're not ready yet.

242
00:12:46.84 --> 00:12:49.84
And there's a, there's a similar obvious,

243
00:12:49.84 --> 00:12:51.48
similar theme here.

244
00:12:51.48 --> 00:12:54.72
So almost every, I never fought in Iraq,

245
00:12:54.72 --> 00:12:57.68
I know Afghanistan, but everyone that I know

246
00:12:57.68 --> 00:13:01.28
that worked on the ground with the Afghan forces

247
00:13:01.28 --> 00:13:03.52
were all not surprised.

248
00:13:03.52 --> 00:13:04.72
Hey, they weren't ready yet.

249
00:13:04.72 --> 00:13:06.44
They just weren't ready yet.

250
00:13:06.44 --> 00:13:08.80
And it's a huge, it's,

251
00:13:08.80 --> 00:13:13.80
it's almost like when you have these, these elements,

252
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:19.16
the US support is really like the long,

253
00:13:19.16 --> 00:13:20.92
pull in the tent.

254
00:13:20.92 --> 00:13:23.64
And all the other tent poles and the canvas

255
00:13:23.64 --> 00:13:25.08
that goes over the tent is,

256
00:13:25.08 --> 00:13:26.36
and the stakes that go on the ground,

257
00:13:26.36 --> 00:13:28.56
all those things are really, really important.

258
00:13:28.56 --> 00:13:30.52
And you can build those up and you can make them

259
00:13:30.52 --> 00:13:33.32
really good and they can provide you shelter from the rain

260
00:13:33.32 --> 00:13:34.72
and shelter from the wind.

261
00:13:34.72 --> 00:13:37.20
But if you pull out that one long pull in the middle,

262
00:13:38.72 --> 00:13:40.76
it has a huge negative impact.

263
00:13:40.76 --> 00:13:44.72
And that sort of, again, in hindsight,

264
00:13:44.72 --> 00:13:46.12
as I look at it, that's what,

265
00:13:46.12 --> 00:13:47.44
that's one of the things I think happened.

266
00:13:47.44 --> 00:13:49.48
Yeah, I think there were just multiple things,

267
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:52.60
I think even right down to the number of ghost soldiers,

268
00:13:52.60 --> 00:13:56.48
so on paper, there might be 300,000 Afghan soldiers

269
00:13:56.48 --> 00:13:59.28
when there's in reality there's a quarter of that,

270
00:13:59.28 --> 00:14:01.16
because people would take command

271
00:14:01.16 --> 00:14:03.68
as we're taking money of people that never existed,

272
00:14:03.68 --> 00:14:07.36
or they were dared, or there was no accountability.

273
00:14:07.36 --> 00:14:10.000
You know, I can go into corruption for days

274
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.56
and how that really destroyed Afghanistan.

275
00:14:13.56 --> 00:14:16.12
And so to drill into that corruption that you just thought,

276
00:14:16.12 --> 00:14:18.24
let me see if I got this little piece of it, right?

277
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:21.48
I'm a commander, I'm an Afghan commander.

278
00:14:21.48 --> 00:14:25.08
If I say I have 500 soldiers, I get X amount of money.

279
00:14:25.08 --> 00:14:25.92
Yep.

280
00:14:25.92 --> 00:14:27.28
So guess how many I have?

281
00:14:27.28 --> 00:14:28.12
700.

282
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:31.16
And two of you guys die, you're not gonna report that,

283
00:14:31.16 --> 00:14:32.64
because you still wanna keep getting their money.

284
00:14:32.64 --> 00:14:34.68
To the point where they would take the bank cards

285
00:14:34.68 --> 00:14:36.68
of the dead soldiers and go to the bank

286
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:39.92
and get their paychecks every week or every month.

287
00:14:39.92 --> 00:14:42.72
Like, it's the level and we can get into this,

288
00:14:42.72 --> 00:14:46.76
but I've never seen a more corrupt place

289
00:14:46.76 --> 00:14:49.68
on every possible level.

290
00:14:49.68 --> 00:14:53.52
And yet, you know, we, and when I say we,

291
00:14:53.52 --> 00:14:57.04
I say, you know, we turned a blind eye to that for really 20 years

292
00:14:57.04 --> 00:14:58.68
and said, are going to the root and fixing it,

293
00:14:58.68 --> 00:15:02.68
we let it fester and create this entire industry

294
00:15:02.68 --> 00:15:04.92
of corruption, which is what the Taliban

295
00:15:04.92 --> 00:15:06.92
was not only able to capitalize on,

296
00:15:06.92 --> 00:15:11.08
but they came in saying, we're not going to be corrupt.

297
00:15:11.08 --> 00:15:13.68
And people that don't even like the telebands,

298
00:15:13.68 --> 00:15:15.96
we'll so fed up with that corruption

299
00:15:15.96 --> 00:15:17.40
that they were gonna support that,

300
00:15:17.40 --> 00:15:19.60
even if they didn't support the ideology.

301
00:15:22.56 --> 00:15:26.08
So you get there on the seventh, the eighth and ninth,

302
00:15:26.08 --> 00:15:28.32
you're meeting with Intel people.

303
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:31.68
It's still not clear that this thing is gonna fall apart,

304
00:15:31.68 --> 00:15:32.88
or you, or is it a little bit,

305
00:15:32.88 --> 00:15:34.60
I think there was this idea of,

306
00:15:34.60 --> 00:15:36.60
well, Kabul was never going to fall.

307
00:15:36.60 --> 00:15:39.40
And certain pockets like Kabul, Pangea,

308
00:15:39.40 --> 00:15:41.80
you know, even Mazaw, which is where I ended up,

309
00:15:41.80 --> 00:15:44.44
these were very, very staunch resistance places,

310
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:48.20
and there was sort of this idea that how can they possibly fall?

311
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:51.76
And so I met with, and I had actually stayed

312
00:15:51.76 --> 00:15:55.36
with him in 2018 and uncarrow was General Dustin.

313
00:15:55.36 --> 00:15:58.48
So General Dustin was the, the warlord,

314
00:15:58.48 --> 00:16:01.32
I guess, who the US troops first went in with

315
00:16:01.32 --> 00:16:04.76
from the north during, after the 9, 11.

316
00:16:04.76 --> 00:16:06.76
And that's where Mike Spend was killed

317
00:16:06.76 --> 00:16:08.20
and sort of the first people there.

318
00:16:08.20 --> 00:16:11.80
So I'd met him several years ago in Turkey

319
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:13.12
and did a profile with him.

320
00:16:13.12 --> 00:16:15.64
And so he invited me to go back to Mazaw

321
00:16:15.64 --> 00:16:18.48
because he was leading some resistance forces there

322
00:16:18.48 --> 00:16:21.16
that were working with the Afghan commanders.

323
00:16:21.16 --> 00:16:24.04
And yeah, it was just sort of this idea,

324
00:16:24.04 --> 00:16:25.84
and I guess looking back, it was, you know,

325
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:27.52
selling a story that didn't exist,

326
00:16:27.52 --> 00:16:30.96
but we decided, okay, well, let's go and cover

327
00:16:30.96 --> 00:16:32.72
what's happening in Mazaw,

328
00:16:32.72 --> 00:16:36.76
even though the northern provinces surrounding it were all sort of falling,

329
00:16:36.76 --> 00:16:39.44
there was this sense that Mazaw was going to hold.

330
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:43.64
So we went to Mazaw, it was very early on a Thursday morning.

331
00:16:43.64 --> 00:16:44.48
How'd you get up better?

332
00:16:44.48 --> 00:16:45.48
We flew, okay.

333
00:16:45.48 --> 00:16:46.92
Yeah, camera.

334
00:16:46.92 --> 00:16:51.36
And so it's about a 50 minute flight from Kabul to Mazaw.

335
00:16:51.36 --> 00:16:54.52
And so we get, did you say, did you say a 50 minute flight?

336
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:55.76
About a 50 minute flight.

337
00:16:55.76 --> 00:16:58.96
And was this, who's, who's flying the helicopters?

338
00:16:58.96 --> 00:16:59.76
Is this just chartered?

339
00:16:59.76 --> 00:17:01.12
This is a commercial airline.

340
00:17:01.12 --> 00:17:02.08
Just a commercial airline.

341
00:17:02.08 --> 00:17:04.44
Yeah, yeah, I've a little commercial airline two weeks ago.

342
00:17:04.44 --> 00:17:06.24
So they still exist.

343
00:17:06.24 --> 00:17:10.12
I was glad to learn that one because there was no landing lights.

344
00:17:10.12 --> 00:17:13.28
But they were still in commercial airlines.

345
00:17:13.28 --> 00:17:15.96
So we flew to Mazaw, because at this point,

346
00:17:15.96 --> 00:17:17.68
you couldn't travel and roads anywhere,

347
00:17:17.68 --> 00:17:20.36
which is something else that's changed significantly now.

348
00:17:20.36 --> 00:17:25.04
But then you couldn't, the Taliban had really cut off

349
00:17:25.04 --> 00:17:26.40
every strategic road.

350
00:17:26.40 --> 00:17:29.36
And you couldn't go much beyond sort of Kabul,

351
00:17:29.36 --> 00:17:33.52
maybe Kabul to Pangea, but that was sort of the most road travel you could do.

352
00:17:33.52 --> 00:17:39.000
So we flew to Mazaw, that was really early in the Thursday morning.

353
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.72
And you get there.

354
00:17:39.72 --> 00:17:42.88
And it was just this incredibly vibrant place.

355
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:47.92
And I just remember, it was the, how, how is there,

356
00:17:47.92 --> 00:17:51.88
how are all these provinces around this place falling to the Taliban?

357
00:17:51.88 --> 00:17:54.04
When the markets were just chocolate block,

358
00:17:54.04 --> 00:17:57.12
and everybody is just going about that daily business.

359
00:17:57.12 --> 00:17:59.20
And I just, I was flabbergasted.

360
00:17:59.20 --> 00:18:02.72
And I thought, isn't, like, what is happening?

361
00:18:02.72 --> 00:18:04.56
And you go and sort of talk to people.

362
00:18:04.56 --> 00:18:06.08
And they be, oh, I'm a little bit worried.

363
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:06.92
But it's okay.

364
00:18:06.92 --> 00:18:07.76
I think it'll be okay.

365
00:18:07.76 --> 00:18:09.92
We'll just flee to Kabul.

366
00:18:09.92 --> 00:18:11.12
So that was the Thursday.

367
00:18:11.12 --> 00:18:14.12
And everything, yeah, it's very normal.

368
00:18:14.12 --> 00:18:18.000
Yeah, so your feeling was, okay, well, obviously this is going to be okay.

369
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.36
Yeah.

370
00:18:18.36 --> 00:18:22.16
And, and, you know, had a couple of friends who were very worried about me being in Mazaw.

371
00:18:22.16 --> 00:18:26.32
And I was sort of like, it seems fine to me.

372
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:31.40
But what did really struck me as weird was that there was no police.

373
00:18:31.40 --> 00:18:35.04
There was no military presence on the street at all.

374
00:18:35.04 --> 00:18:39.92
I didn't see a single, like Afghan forces come through.

375
00:18:39.92 --> 00:18:41.36
And I, I thought that was strange.

376
00:18:41.36 --> 00:18:44.28
I thought, where is, where is this?

377
00:18:44.28 --> 00:18:45.36
Like, this is city.

378
00:18:45.36 --> 00:18:47.88
This is in the middle of a firestorm here.

379
00:18:47.88 --> 00:18:51.40
And there is zero security forces right now.

380
00:18:51.40 --> 00:18:53.000
So that struck me as strange.

381
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.16
But everybody was going about life.

382
00:18:55.16 --> 00:18:59.08
And then the next day, Friday, which is the weekend day in Afghanistan.

383
00:18:59.08 --> 00:19:03.24
But still things were out and I was going out interviewing people.

384
00:19:03.24 --> 00:19:05.32
I just asked you how they felt, people in the markets.

385
00:19:05.32 --> 00:19:07.48
And people were starting to feel really worried.

386
00:19:07.48 --> 00:19:10.32
They said, well, you know, we think it's going to fall.

387
00:19:10.32 --> 00:19:13.32
But we just don't know when it's going to happen.

388
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:19.68
And as the day progressed, you felt it get a little bit people were becoming more tense.

389
00:19:19.68 --> 00:19:22.08
And we go to this, there's a beautiful big blue mask.

390
00:19:22.08 --> 00:19:24.000
A big shrine there that's that's quite famous.

391
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.20
And there were just a lot of people that had fled from other villages and other provinces.

392
00:19:28.20 --> 00:19:32.40
And they were all sort of hanging out outside this mask.

393
00:19:32.40 --> 00:19:34.64
And by the evening, things were still happening.

394
00:19:34.64 --> 00:19:40.88
But I said to Jake, my photographer, we need to book this return flight back to Kabul.

395
00:19:40.88 --> 00:19:41.88
And so I get online.

396
00:19:41.88 --> 00:19:45.48
And then like the earliest flight we can get is Monday night.

397
00:19:45.48 --> 00:19:49.32
And I was like, I think it's, you know, I called a few people as I kiss it going to

398
00:19:49.32 --> 00:19:50.32
hold.

399
00:19:50.32 --> 00:19:53.08
And they were like, yeah, you know, you should be fine.

400
00:19:53.08 --> 00:19:57.24
But get out in the next flight you can get back to Kabul.

401
00:19:57.24 --> 00:19:58.72
So I booked the flight.

402
00:19:58.72 --> 00:20:02.12
So you're online booking a flight, which means you're online watching news and seeing

403
00:20:02.12 --> 00:20:03.12
updates for other things.

404
00:20:03.12 --> 00:20:04.12
Yeah.

405
00:20:04.12 --> 00:20:05.12
Yeah.

406
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:08.28
And it's still, you got the impression, because I'm sure I don't remember exactly.

407
00:20:08.28 --> 00:20:13.24
I knew that you were in Mazar through social media because you're like posting about

408
00:20:13.24 --> 00:20:15.76
this stuff.

409
00:20:15.76 --> 00:20:20.44
But I also remember seeing, you know, sort of the battle map of what's happening and

410
00:20:20.44 --> 00:20:29.52
seeing the various provinces collapse around.

411
00:20:29.52 --> 00:20:34.36
So yeah, and I remember thinking that too, and I thought this doesn't feel right.

412
00:20:34.36 --> 00:20:38.48
But that night we went out with the commando, the Afghan commando, and they were taking

413
00:20:38.48 --> 00:20:41.12
a lot of hits and a lot of fighting.

414
00:20:41.12 --> 00:20:45.88
But they was such extraordinary, and again, you know, this perhaps walked my thinking a

415
00:20:45.88 --> 00:20:49.16
little bit too, but you have these men who were just like, we will never give this up.

416
00:20:49.16 --> 00:20:50.64
They will never get Mazar.

417
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:56.40
We will, you know, and defend it and hold it and just really great young men.

418
00:20:56.40 --> 00:20:59.52
And we stayed out with them until we were about to hook up that morning.

419
00:20:59.52 --> 00:21:02.12
And there was this sort of strange sense with one of them.

420
00:21:02.12 --> 00:21:03.12
His name was Safi.

421
00:21:03.12 --> 00:21:06.40
And he kept, you could tell how much he missed the West.

422
00:21:06.40 --> 00:21:10.08
He wanted a sustained drink, beer with him, and listen to music.

423
00:21:10.08 --> 00:21:12.12
And he just, he didn't want us to leave.

424
00:21:12.12 --> 00:21:17.40
He just, he wanted this sense of this connection to the West that I think that you

425
00:21:17.40 --> 00:21:21.40
had been trained by the Americans and just have this sort of deep love.

426
00:21:21.40 --> 00:21:22.40
So two-clock came.

427
00:21:22.40 --> 00:21:25.76
We got the guys to take us back to Ahotel and we were supposed to go out with them again

428
00:21:25.76 --> 00:21:28.44
at around 7 or 8 that morning.

429
00:21:28.44 --> 00:21:32.92
So we wake up on the Saturday and I'm waiting for a call from him.

430
00:21:32.92 --> 00:21:33.92
He's not there.

431
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:35.60
He's not answering his phone.

432
00:21:35.60 --> 00:21:37.48
And I thought, you know, God, I hope he's okay.

433
00:21:37.48 --> 00:21:38.48
This is strange.

434
00:21:38.48 --> 00:21:43.44
I don't know what to do, but I will just wait for him to contact me again.

435
00:21:43.44 --> 00:21:45.52
And then we thought, let's go out and do some stories.

436
00:21:45.52 --> 00:21:50.56
And we tried to contact some fixes or interpreters that we had known live there.

437
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:51.56
Everyone had fled to Kabul.

438
00:21:51.56 --> 00:21:53.56
We could not find anybody.

439
00:21:53.56 --> 00:21:59.40
Eventually, by mid-morning, we found somebody who said he could come and be an interpreter

440
00:21:59.40 --> 00:22:01.36
if we did some interviews.

441
00:22:01.36 --> 00:22:03.000
And so we went out.

442
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.36
It was just suddenly this ghost town.

443
00:22:05.36 --> 00:22:11.24
From this, it had gone from extremely vibrant place to this complete ghost town.

444
00:22:11.24 --> 00:22:15.48
You just saw people lining up outside banks, just trying to get them money out.

445
00:22:15.48 --> 00:22:21.84
And we're walking and people just fleeing from the outside villages into Mazar.

446
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:27.40
On those little rickshores, and you know, with all their stuff and we met with this interpreter

447
00:22:27.40 --> 00:22:33.36
and we get into a cab and we're driving out toward there was three front lines.

448
00:22:33.36 --> 00:22:38.84
And the interpreter who I didn't really know too well is on the phone as we're driving.

449
00:22:38.84 --> 00:22:40.48
And it's about midday.

450
00:22:40.48 --> 00:22:42.96
And suddenly he looks at me and he tends around.

451
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:45.28
He's got this big smile on his face.

452
00:22:45.28 --> 00:22:49.60
And he says, oh, they just broke through the first of the three lines.

453
00:22:49.60 --> 00:22:50.88
And it's surrounded.

454
00:22:50.88 --> 00:22:55.56
And we looked at each other and the cab driver was like, I'm really scared.

455
00:22:55.56 --> 00:22:56.84
Because we're sort of driving to what it.

456
00:22:56.84 --> 00:22:59.32
And I said, okay, let's find what we'll turn around and go back.

457
00:22:59.32 --> 00:23:01.32
It's no big deal.

458
00:23:01.32 --> 00:23:03.64
So we went back and I went.

459
00:23:03.64 --> 00:23:06.96
When you had this detail that you just gave me, he was smiling.

460
00:23:06.96 --> 00:23:12.08
Yeah, he was, and I still can't figure out why he was smiling if he just didn't care

461
00:23:12.08 --> 00:23:16.64
if he was a Taliban or if he just was trying to appease me.

462
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:19.48
So I was like, oh, he thought, hey, I'm getting to get you some stories.

463
00:23:19.48 --> 00:23:20.84
They just broke through here with you.

464
00:23:20.84 --> 00:23:22.04
Yeah, he's sitting there in the front.

465
00:23:22.04 --> 00:23:26.64
He's like, tens of rad and it's just this, they just broke through the first.

466
00:23:26.64 --> 00:23:31.12
And I'm okay.

467
00:23:31.12 --> 00:23:36.04
So I get back to the hotel and I'm trying to make some phone calls because there's no

468
00:23:36.04 --> 00:23:39.04
flight out that I can get earlier than that Monday.

469
00:23:39.04 --> 00:23:42.44
And there's no way, it can, you know, to 10 hour drive, but there's no way it could even

470
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:45.88
attempt to do that drive because it's all Taliban controlled.

471
00:23:45.88 --> 00:23:50.24
And so I'm making some calls to, you know, again, to my Intel contacts and Kabul and even

472
00:23:50.24 --> 00:23:52.48
then they're saying, no, no, it should hold.

473
00:23:52.48 --> 00:23:54.32
It'll hold, don't worry.

474
00:23:54.32 --> 00:23:58.56
And I was starting to get pretty worried and I was just strapping myself, you know, doing

475
00:23:58.56 --> 00:24:03.92
some work and things and then, and then we normally go to this, there was a cabab cafe

476
00:24:03.92 --> 00:24:05.88
that we'd always go to each night.

477
00:24:05.88 --> 00:24:06.88
And it was a really lively place.

478
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:10.08
It was underground, they would play these terrible soap operas, but there was always

479
00:24:10.08 --> 00:24:13.000
like a lot of people there playing music.

480
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.24
And so Jake and I said, okay, well, let's go to this cabab cafe and we step out.

481
00:24:16.24 --> 00:24:19.52
It's just pitch black and not a single person around.

482
00:24:19.52 --> 00:24:23.92
And I'm still figuring out, we walked at this cabab cafe and it's open.

483
00:24:23.92 --> 00:24:26.84
We're like, oh, it's open and we go downstairs and the TV is off.

484
00:24:26.84 --> 00:24:29.84
And there's just these, the two guys that work there, they're just sitting there.

485
00:24:29.84 --> 00:24:33.72
And we all have food and we're sitting there and then we just let each other and we're like,

486
00:24:33.72 --> 00:24:36.20
something is really, really wrong.

487
00:24:36.20 --> 00:24:37.84
We need to go.

488
00:24:37.84 --> 00:24:41.36
And so we get up and we start hurrying back towards the hotel.

489
00:24:41.36 --> 00:24:47.68
This was early evening around seven and then you just see those motorcycles coming in.

490
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:49.44
And that's the Taliban.

491
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:53.28
And so we sort of hurry back just in time to get to our hotel and go to the roof and

492
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:56.48
I'm just looking out and the Taliban is just circling.

493
00:24:56.48 --> 00:24:59.92
There's just hundreds of them and they're shooting in the air and they're playing

494
00:24:59.92 --> 00:25:04.68
then a sheet, which is their religious music and celebrating that they just took a

495
00:25:04.68 --> 00:25:08.36
city without firing a shot basically.

496
00:25:08.36 --> 00:25:11.12
But what also struck me during the day and that was the other bizarre thing.

497
00:25:11.12 --> 00:25:17.80
I thought, here is a city that's falling and there was no air power.

498
00:25:17.80 --> 00:25:20.04
There was not a sound in the air.

499
00:25:20.04 --> 00:25:22.44
And I remember that something and I did a little video about it.

500
00:25:22.44 --> 00:25:25.08
I was like, where is the air power?

501
00:25:25.08 --> 00:25:26.08
Didn't we train?

502
00:25:26.08 --> 00:25:31.68
Didn't we put just tens hundreds of millions of dollars into this Afghan Air Force

503
00:25:31.68 --> 00:25:33.000
where the hell is it?

504
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.36
Because I don't hear it.

505
00:25:34.36 --> 00:25:39.24
And air powers are a great example of the long pole in the tent.

506
00:25:39.24 --> 00:25:43.08
If you have air power when the Taliban is coming in on their motorcycles and in their

507
00:25:43.08 --> 00:25:45.28
trucks, they can't, yeah.

508
00:25:45.28 --> 00:25:46.28
Literally can't do it.

509
00:25:46.28 --> 00:25:51.64
And that's the long pole in the tent that falls apart when that happens.

510
00:25:51.64 --> 00:25:57.12
As you were talking about like the talking of one of the Afghan soldiers that you

511
00:25:57.12 --> 00:26:00.12
knew and how he, you know, hey, we're going to stay here.

512
00:26:00.12 --> 00:26:03.08
We're going to fight them and take us.

513
00:26:03.08 --> 00:26:08.60
Do you remember all that stuff that happened up in Portland when the Antifa took over

514
00:26:08.60 --> 00:26:12.64
the part of the neighborhood or whatever they were calling it?

515
00:26:12.64 --> 00:26:16.36
I think it was originally called Chop and then they changed it to Chaz but it was the

516
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:18.80
occupied zone or something like this.

517
00:26:18.80 --> 00:26:20.88
But somebody was asking me about it.

518
00:26:20.88 --> 00:26:26.52
And I kind of said, hey, there's no one up there in the Chop.

519
00:26:26.52 --> 00:26:29.72
That's like ready to die for the cause.

520
00:26:29.72 --> 00:26:31.28
That's ready to say, you know what?

521
00:26:31.28 --> 00:26:33.28
We're going to stay here.

522
00:26:33.28 --> 00:26:34.48
They're just not, there's not up there.

523
00:26:34.48 --> 00:26:39.28
There's no, I mean, America and I kind of made the comment that, hey, even the people

524
00:26:39.28 --> 00:26:42.28
that are Antifa members, guess what?

525
00:26:42.28 --> 00:26:46.76
They have cell phones and they have, you know, like nice, they have clothing and they

526
00:26:46.76 --> 00:26:50.76
have running water and it's just not that bad of a thing and they're not right that

527
00:26:50.76 --> 00:26:52.44
committed to it.

528
00:26:52.44 --> 00:27:00.96
And it's interesting when you think about what it really takes for someone to stand

529
00:27:00.96 --> 00:27:06.32
up and be willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause, whatever that cause is.

530
00:27:06.32 --> 00:27:11.36
And when you look at the Taliban and you, you're this Afghan person that's been fighting

531
00:27:11.36 --> 00:27:14.76
for however many years and you've been fighting for the Americans, you've been fighting for

532
00:27:14.76 --> 00:27:18.60
the Afghan government for 10 years or seven years.

533
00:27:18.60 --> 00:27:22.88
And then you're like, well, it looks like we're completely surrounded.

534
00:27:22.88 --> 00:27:28.08
If I fight, I'm going to die or I can just kind of put down my weapon, take off my uniform

535
00:27:28.08 --> 00:27:30.08
and carry on with my life.

536
00:27:30.08 --> 00:27:37.80
And I, yeah, and I was, you know, I, and I think all sort of the next day, well, do

537
00:27:37.80 --> 00:27:41.60
a button came out and said, you know, these guys ran away from their posts and things

538
00:27:41.60 --> 00:27:45.04
and, and to a degree I understand where that came from, but it actually, it upsat

539
00:27:45.04 --> 00:27:49.92
me because they were really sold out by their leadership.

540
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:50.92
And I'll give you examples.

541
00:27:50.92 --> 00:27:54.64
So, Safi, the guy that I met that Friday when I was finally able to get back in contact

542
00:27:54.64 --> 00:27:57.56
with him after Mazarad Follin and I asked him, are you okay?

543
00:27:57.56 --> 00:28:03.000
Or are you? and he said, you know, he've gone out that day and they just, they were so

544
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.56
outnumbered and he's three bodyguards had been killed and, you know, it was really the

545
00:28:07.56 --> 00:28:11.32
commanders that were trying to hold it and he said, by four o'clock that afternoon,

546
00:28:11.32 --> 00:28:14.16
somebody came to him and said, oh, dust and left.

547
00:28:14.16 --> 00:28:18.52
And so did the commander left, like, oh, your commander's left and it's up to you if you

548
00:28:18.52 --> 00:28:25.24
want to stay and die or you can leave and he just, he, they were sold out, like everybody.

549
00:28:25.24 --> 00:28:32.20
I did hear stories from guys that I knew that said that the Taliban would like a

550
00:28:32.20 --> 00:28:36.32
pro-chivalage and just send a messenger in there and be like, hey, you know, here's your

551
00:28:36.32 --> 00:28:37.32
chance.

552
00:28:37.32 --> 00:28:39.84
We know you were, you know, we know your Afghans security.

553
00:28:39.84 --> 00:28:43.76
You can put down your guns and be cool or we're going to kill everyone.

554
00:28:43.76 --> 00:28:47.40
And guys were like, okay, we're surrounded, we're going to die.

555
00:28:47.40 --> 00:28:51.36
I guess we'll just go back to the way used to be by the way.

556
00:28:51.36 --> 00:28:55.92
That's the other thing, it was they have sort of a lot of them had memory of what

557
00:28:55.92 --> 00:28:59.52
it used to be like and it's like, okay, well, I guess we're going back to the way used

558
00:28:59.52 --> 00:29:05.16
to be, but it's better to do that and be alive than be dead.

559
00:29:05.16 --> 00:29:09.000
And the amount of sacrifices that a lot of those Afghans soldiers made, I mean, they

560
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.48
weren't even released the number of killed, but it's well-posed 100,000.

561
00:29:14.48 --> 00:29:20.32
Yeah, I mean, there was at least 50,000 killed going into this whole thing taking place.

562
00:29:20.32 --> 00:29:26.88
So it's not like, and again, there's plenty of Americans that fought alongside the Afghans

563
00:29:26.88 --> 00:29:31.76
and had met awesome Afghans troops, just like in Iraq, you know, there was.

564
00:29:31.76 --> 00:29:38.08
And by the time you were in Iraq and the Iraqis were fighting ISIS, they were taking massive

565
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:41.68
casualties, massive casualties going to take Muzuel back.

566
00:29:41.68 --> 00:29:44.48
That was led by the Iraqi forces.

567
00:29:44.48 --> 00:29:48.76
And they took massive casualties and they kept going, compared to in the battle from

568
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:52.96
the Saudi Arabia, Iraqi forces were some of them, were very scared and didn't want to

569
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:55.32
take lead and definitely didn't want to take casualties.

570
00:29:55.32 --> 00:29:59.000
We had a whole battalions abandoned and leave.

571
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.44
So that idea of this kind of, this kind of clear cut American version of the way things

572
00:30:07.44 --> 00:30:10.08
are, is doesn't apply here.

573
00:30:10.08 --> 00:30:18.60
There's no clear cut way of, hey, oh, if you get captured, American, you get captured,

574
00:30:18.60 --> 00:30:19.60
you know what's going to happen.

575
00:30:19.60 --> 00:30:22.60
You're going to get tortured, you're going to kill, it's like, hey, you're an Afghan security

576
00:30:22.60 --> 00:30:25.60
force and you surrender.

577
00:30:25.60 --> 00:30:28.24
You're not sure what's going to happen, but you know what's going to happen if you don't

578
00:30:28.24 --> 00:30:30.04
surrender, you're going to die.

579
00:30:30.04 --> 00:30:33.48
So, and then you see your leadership.

580
00:30:33.48 --> 00:30:37.88
Oh, right away, all running away, all of them.

581
00:30:37.88 --> 00:30:41.60
And every single one of them ran away, including the president, including the president,

582
00:30:41.60 --> 00:30:48.56
including the president, who, yeah, with that guy, that is an insane

583
00:30:48.56 --> 00:30:49.56
situation.

584
00:30:49.56 --> 00:30:56.92
I mean, you have that guy, Ashraf Ghani, who, who is like a professor at Berkeley, a professor

585
00:30:56.92 --> 00:31:04.32
at Johns Hopkins, went to some leadership school at Harvard wrote the book called Fixing

586
00:31:04.32 --> 00:31:10.76
Failed States, which is like an academic exploration of this, the theoretical, it's an

587
00:31:10.76 --> 00:31:11.76
embarrassment.

588
00:31:11.76 --> 00:31:12.76
Yeah.

589
00:31:12.76 --> 00:31:14.32
And he bailed with a bunch of money by the way.

590
00:31:14.32 --> 00:31:19.32
And yeah, a bunch of money is now under investigation, but what, what I remember going back

591
00:31:19.32 --> 00:31:25.44
in being Afghanistan in 2017, and sort of hearing when I'd go to the NATO Compound of the

592
00:31:25.44 --> 00:31:29.000
US embassy and everyone would say all these great things about Ghani.

593
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.40
And I remember saying to a few people, have you gone out to the street just to talk to the Afghan

594
00:31:34.40 --> 00:31:37.32
people because they have a different idea, you know.

595
00:31:37.32 --> 00:31:42.80
So I think part of that problem was the US because nobody was leaving that base in the

596
00:31:42.80 --> 00:31:47.64
diplomacy world, they were getting a vacuum of information that was pre-approved people to

597
00:31:47.64 --> 00:31:48.64
enter.

598
00:31:48.64 --> 00:31:51.24
That were all part of this sort of puppetry stream.

599
00:31:51.24 --> 00:31:54.56
And they weren't actually out there talking to the Afghans who were terribly frustrated

600
00:31:54.56 --> 00:31:59.000
with the corruption going on, terribly frustrated with the sort of, I guess, the, the past

601
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.36
tune and the sectarianism and things.

602
00:32:01.36 --> 00:32:07.44
And I just, the picture that was so warped compared to the reality that I saw even back

603
00:32:07.44 --> 00:32:08.44
then.

604
00:32:08.44 --> 00:32:14.40
And that was, so 2017, you're all talking to normal people and they're totally frustrated

605
00:32:14.40 --> 00:32:15.40
with Ghani.

606
00:32:15.40 --> 00:32:20.48
And yet the Americans are getting this white-washed version of how Ali is doing an excellent

607
00:32:20.48 --> 00:32:21.48
job.

608
00:32:21.48 --> 00:32:22.48
Yeah.

609
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:23.48
Yeah.

610
00:32:23.48 --> 00:32:24.48
Yeah.

611
00:32:24.48 --> 00:32:25.48
Yeah.

612
00:32:25.48 --> 00:32:26.48
Yeah.

613
00:32:26.48 --> 00:32:29.04
So it was like August 14th.

614
00:32:29.04 --> 00:32:32.68
So Mazar Falls, Kabul Falls, too.

615
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:33.68
So that was the episode.

616
00:32:33.68 --> 00:32:34.92
That was the Saturday night.

617
00:32:34.92 --> 00:32:41.56
So suddenly I'm like in this room in this hotel and the locals at all fled and there

618
00:32:41.56 --> 00:32:45.16
were no foreigners in there except I think there was a guy from Dika Stan who was there for

619
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:46.44
a couple of days and someone else.

620
00:32:46.44 --> 00:32:51.32
But so in Jacob and I look at each other and we said, well, what are we going to do?

621
00:32:51.32 --> 00:32:57.76
You know, we're making some calls and I'm speaking to some, some deal to people in Kabul.

622
00:32:57.76 --> 00:33:00.72
And they said, well, you know, go and get us measurements, go and get us a cold and it's

623
00:33:00.72 --> 00:33:06.52
going to this and that and we'll see if we can get you out in the morning, the early morning.

624
00:33:06.52 --> 00:33:08.64
And it was an interesting night.

625
00:33:08.64 --> 00:33:16.64
So you had, you know, I was trying to get all this information and then the morning

626
00:33:16.64 --> 00:33:21.48
and the telebands were out having a crazy, you know, teleband party all night.

627
00:33:21.48 --> 00:33:25.04
And so by the morning light, I thought, well, they'd gone to sleep then because they

628
00:33:25.04 --> 00:33:29.68
celebrated all night and they'd gone to sleep but then nobody's calling.

629
00:33:29.68 --> 00:33:33.60
They were just sort of looking at each other going well, now it's kind of the chance to get

630
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:37.72
out in this period where they're not in the street because they're going to be in the street

631
00:33:37.72 --> 00:33:40.36
in a couple of hours.

632
00:33:40.36 --> 00:33:42.84
But it became very evident that just it wasn't going to happen.

633
00:33:42.84 --> 00:33:48.20
And then then that Sunday, we started seeing news reports that the telebands were at the

634
00:33:48.20 --> 00:33:52.24
gates of Kabul and then the next thing, you know, they're taking the palace and we just sort

635
00:33:52.24 --> 00:33:57.76
of, I looked at, I looked at Jacob and that happens and I said, well, we're pretty much,

636
00:33:57.76 --> 00:34:00.36
we've got to figure this out.

637
00:34:00.36 --> 00:34:05.76
Were you feeling, were you feeling threatened with when the teleband showed up?

638
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:12.16
So the images that they were portraying of the teleband was like a kind or gentler,

639
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:13.68
teleband was coming in right?

640
00:34:13.68 --> 00:34:16.24
It was like, you said it was like celebratory.

641
00:34:16.24 --> 00:34:17.24
Yeah.

642
00:34:17.24 --> 00:34:19.84
It didn't look like a angry mob.

643
00:34:19.84 --> 00:34:26.52
It looked like a happy mob that was celebrating in that, that was sort of the images that

644
00:34:26.52 --> 00:34:27.68
we got initially.

645
00:34:27.68 --> 00:34:32.76
And it quickly turned into images of people being killed, people being murdered.

646
00:34:32.76 --> 00:34:35.000
But what was your initial impression?

647
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.64
My initial impression was, it was just bizarre because I was like, well, these barbarians

648
00:34:40.64 --> 00:34:41.64
in the street.

649
00:34:41.64 --> 00:34:44.96
How was this, like, and then doing announcements over the last speaker?

650
00:34:44.96 --> 00:34:50.52
And it was so strange because you saw this instant transformation of a city and they did

651
00:34:50.52 --> 00:34:52.24
look a little, you know, intimidating.

652
00:34:52.24 --> 00:34:53.64
They were just so many of them.

653
00:34:53.64 --> 00:34:58.08
And that was a thing.

654
00:34:58.08 --> 00:34:59.32
I felt, where did these people come from because Miss Al was a very strong teleband resistance

655
00:34:59.32 --> 00:35:00.32
place.

656
00:35:00.32 --> 00:35:03.08
And suddenly, it's just, there's hundreds of them.

657
00:35:03.08 --> 00:35:05.32
And I don't know where you, they come from.

658
00:35:05.32 --> 00:35:08.04
And I, I sent Jake out to buy me a book or at the market.

659
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:09.04
And he just came back.

660
00:35:09.04 --> 00:35:10.04
He's like, my God.

661
00:35:10.04 --> 00:35:12.96
They're just, they're crazy, you know.

662
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:15.96
And so we were trying to, I guess, figure out.

663
00:35:15.96 --> 00:35:16.96
Where did I mean by crazy?

664
00:35:16.96 --> 00:35:19.56
He just, like, they're, they're just everywhere.

665
00:35:19.56 --> 00:35:20.56
Okay.

666
00:35:20.56 --> 00:35:23.52
And they just, you know, that they literally have sort of the dominance of the

667
00:35:23.52 --> 00:35:26.36
of every corner possible in the city.

668
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:27.52
And that was their strategy.

669
00:35:27.52 --> 00:35:31.48
I think in the very beginning when they took places, they just flooded it with

670
00:35:31.48 --> 00:35:34.32
lighters to make sure that they could hold it.

671
00:35:34.32 --> 00:35:38.76
Now, a normal person would concentrate on hiding and getting out of there.

672
00:35:38.76 --> 00:35:41.28
But you kind of focused on, let's go interview people.

673
00:35:41.28 --> 00:35:42.28
So, not quite.

674
00:35:42.28 --> 00:35:45.84
So, I mean, I first went a little quiet.

675
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:47.76
I was like, I don't know.

676
00:35:47.76 --> 00:35:49.08
And I was trying to pretend to my parents.

677
00:35:49.08 --> 00:35:50.08
I wasn't in the city.

678
00:35:50.08 --> 00:35:52.64
I was straight away in my dad's like, we just had on the news, Miss Al's full.

679
00:35:52.64 --> 00:35:57.08
And you there, I said, no, I'm outside the city.

680
00:35:57.08 --> 00:36:02.04
So, I was trying to, yeah, to try and open his them a little bit.

681
00:36:02.04 --> 00:36:04.64
So, I was a little unclear.

682
00:36:04.64 --> 00:36:10.64
And what sort of concern had concern me at that point was, I know that first night

683
00:36:10.64 --> 00:36:13.16
that they came in, and there was a bank underneath the hotel.

684
00:36:13.16 --> 00:36:18.28
So, the televents of desperately trying to get into the hotel where we were.

685
00:36:18.28 --> 00:36:21.76
And we knew that we were the only foreigners in there at that point.

686
00:36:21.76 --> 00:36:24.28
These incredible hotel staff had stayed there for us.

687
00:36:24.28 --> 00:36:28.88
And they were terrified because they'd all been former NDIS or previously worked in different

688
00:36:28.88 --> 00:36:30.76
capacities with the Afghans.

689
00:36:30.76 --> 00:36:35.40
And I knew that they were desperately wanting to go home to, you know, safety or flee

690
00:36:35.40 --> 00:36:36.40
or their families.

691
00:36:36.40 --> 00:36:37.60
But they really stayed there for us.

692
00:36:37.60 --> 00:36:41.24
And that was just something that I thought was just extraordinary.

693
00:36:41.24 --> 00:36:45.12
And it goes back to that Afghan hospitality and care.

694
00:36:45.12 --> 00:36:46.76
So, we were there.

695
00:36:46.76 --> 00:36:49.08
And several days are going by.

696
00:36:49.08 --> 00:36:55.24
And the focus was to get out, but it just, it became so, and my phone was just blowing

697
00:36:55.24 --> 00:36:56.24
up.

698
00:36:56.24 --> 00:36:59.28
But so many different people telling me, do this, do this, and I was just like, you all need

699
00:36:59.28 --> 00:37:05.04
to leave me alone at this point, please, because it's not helping.

700
00:37:05.04 --> 00:37:09.20
And I said to the US people that I was speaking to right from the beginning, I think the

701
00:37:09.20 --> 00:37:10.80
only way is you go and talk.

702
00:37:10.80 --> 00:37:15.20
Like I need to go and talk to them to get their permission to leave.

703
00:37:15.20 --> 00:37:17.68
Because they really wasn't another way.

704
00:37:17.68 --> 00:37:21.88
It wasn't really a way that I felt that I could sneak out or, you know, go on to the

705
00:37:21.88 --> 00:37:23.40
radar.

706
00:37:23.40 --> 00:37:26.84
And yeah, that was what I was pushing for from the beginning.

707
00:37:26.84 --> 00:37:30.84
So that was sort of my focus in doing that.

708
00:37:30.84 --> 00:37:37.12
So it falls on like the 14th, 15th, and you spend the next few days trying to figure out

709
00:37:37.12 --> 00:37:38.60
what the best course of action is.

710
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:40.000
And so what'd you finally figure out?

711
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.28
So, yeah, I talked to some of you different people and I thought, you know, any sort of

712
00:37:44.28 --> 00:37:46.000
rescue, any whatever is not going to happen.

713
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.04
So I talked to a couple of diplomats and then I talked to, sort of I guess a middle

714
00:37:51.04 --> 00:37:54.64
person who was a Afghan business guy.

715
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:56.000
And so it was very, very quick.

716
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.48
And then he sort of said, well, I'll come to the hotel and, you know, be ready at this

717
00:38:01.48 --> 00:38:02.72
time.

718
00:38:02.72 --> 00:38:09.12
And they teed some things up with the US bet console, which was closed, but they were able

719
00:38:09.12 --> 00:38:10.32
to kind of get it open.

720
00:38:10.32 --> 00:38:13.12
So next, you know, I'm dragging my stuff down.

721
00:38:13.12 --> 00:38:16.88
And the two people that come to meet me is my driver is at the two Taliban elders, you

722
00:38:16.88 --> 00:38:22.28
know, the cousin of the, he's shadow governor, his turn, new governor.

723
00:38:22.28 --> 00:38:26.28
So you see these sort of old Taliban guys and, and I'm getting into the car with them

724
00:38:26.28 --> 00:38:28.40
and they were like, welcome.

725
00:38:28.40 --> 00:38:29.76
It was so bizarre.

726
00:38:29.76 --> 00:38:35.000
So I was like, what a high.

727
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.44
Because at that point, we really didn't know, well, I guess.

728
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:38.88
It's just you and Jake getting into the car.

729
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:41.88
Yeah, just Jake and I getting into the car with the Taliban's.

730
00:38:41.88 --> 00:38:44.48
And we didn't know at that point, you know, how they're going to treat a foreign, how

731
00:38:44.48 --> 00:38:48.52
they were going to treat a woman, how they were going to treat a journalist.

732
00:38:48.52 --> 00:38:52.96
And so yeah, they, they drove us through the city and I said, do you mind if I have a talk

733
00:38:52.96 --> 00:38:56.56
to you and ask you some questions and they said, sure.

734
00:38:56.56 --> 00:39:02.52
And, you know, telling me about, I'm asking them about there, how they viewed Islamic law

735
00:39:02.52 --> 00:39:05.88
or entry law and what they wanted and they just sort of said, well, you know, we want

736
00:39:05.88 --> 00:39:08.12
people's hands to be topped off when they steal.

737
00:39:08.12 --> 00:39:14.000
And if you murder, then you should be, I for an eye kind of thing and telling me all about

738
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
their rulings.

739
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.52
And, but at the same time they were like, yeah, you're welcome enough, Afghanistan, you're

740
00:39:19.52 --> 00:39:22.08
welcome to stay as long as you like.

741
00:39:22.08 --> 00:39:25.24
And we hope you enjoy our country.

742
00:39:25.24 --> 00:39:26.48
And it was very bizarre.

743
00:39:26.48 --> 00:39:30.64
And then we were dropped off of the Uzbek Council.

744
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:33.64
And then suddenly these other Taliban's came.

745
00:39:33.64 --> 00:39:38.72
And they were, there's a group of them, really young ones, like in their early 20's and

746
00:39:38.72 --> 00:39:40.08
they were going to be out escort.

747
00:39:40.08 --> 00:39:43.20
And the only way, sort of, because we couldn't go back to Kabul was to go north to the

748
00:39:43.20 --> 00:39:44.20
Uzbek border.

749
00:39:44.20 --> 00:39:49.96
And so you had these bunch of these young Taliban's who were just, who wanted to take selfies

750
00:39:49.96 --> 00:39:53.92
and, you know, continue to send, they continued to send long after that.

751
00:39:53.92 --> 00:39:59.16
My photography, you know, selfies are themselves with, you know, urging music in the background

752
00:39:59.16 --> 00:40:00.88
and love heart emojis.

753
00:40:00.88 --> 00:40:04.76
And so it's literally the most bizarre thing you can imagine.

754
00:40:04.76 --> 00:40:06.36
I know, I was looking at pictures.

755
00:40:06.36 --> 00:40:07.76
I'm sorry, you're articles.

756
00:40:07.76 --> 00:40:15.04
You have pictures of these Taliban guys, like with their iPhones or whatever, out, they're

757
00:40:15.04 --> 00:40:16.04
doing selfies.

758
00:40:16.04 --> 00:40:17.04
Yeah.

759
00:40:17.04 --> 00:40:19.04
It's freaking, and they're all they want.

760
00:40:19.04 --> 00:40:20.04
Yeah.

761
00:40:20.04 --> 00:40:22.84
And they, and they harass and, and I know, there was a couple of other photographers that

762
00:40:22.84 --> 00:40:26.48
I know, and they harass, poor Jake and, and the other photographers get a rest for their

763
00:40:26.48 --> 00:40:27.48
photos.

764
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:29.72
So if you take a picture of a teleman's, oh, I need to WhatsApp.

765
00:40:29.72 --> 00:40:32.08
If I need to WhatsApp and get in, then they just harassing.

766
00:40:32.08 --> 00:40:33.08
They want pictures of themselves.

767
00:40:33.08 --> 00:40:35.08
Like, it's just, it's so new to them.

768
00:40:35.08 --> 00:40:38.76
These are people who are in hiding in the mountains for 20 years.

769
00:40:38.76 --> 00:40:45.64
And then suddenly they're like out and free in kind of a spectacolic, it's very bizarre.

770
00:40:45.64 --> 00:40:50.64
How does selfies and Instagram match up with Sharia Law?

771
00:40:50.64 --> 00:40:52.04
I'm not sure about that one.

772
00:40:52.04 --> 00:40:55.16
I guess it's, it's, it's a new for Sharia, maybe.

773
00:40:55.16 --> 00:40:56.16
How does that work?

774
00:40:56.16 --> 00:40:59.28
They haven't bought a ruling on it yet.

775
00:40:59.28 --> 00:41:01.60
Man, that's crazy.

776
00:41:01.60 --> 00:41:06.000
So you, were you at any point at what point did you go?

777
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.24
I think I'm going to be okay.

778
00:41:08.24 --> 00:41:10.12
Did the old Taliban make you feel that way?

779
00:41:10.12 --> 00:41:12.64
Did the young Taliban make you feel that way?

780
00:41:12.64 --> 00:41:17.20
I think, well, I did, I did feel like I was going to be okay even when I was stuck in

781
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:18.20
the hotel.

782
00:41:18.20 --> 00:41:23.84
I think the first night I was a little bit, well, you had a normal sense of fear, I guess.

783
00:41:23.84 --> 00:41:27.96
I certainly, I didn't panic, but I was a little bit frown.

784
00:41:27.96 --> 00:41:31.48
This wasn't in the plan at all.

785
00:41:31.48 --> 00:41:35.20
But actually, it's, it's small things that make you feel that I remember this young man from

786
00:41:35.20 --> 00:41:39.16
the hotel came up to me and he said, and he put the manager of the hotel on the phone

787
00:41:39.16 --> 00:41:40.68
to me, the owner.

788
00:41:40.68 --> 00:41:43.48
And the owner said to me, don't worry.

789
00:41:43.48 --> 00:41:47.000
I've already talked to the Taliban and they promised not to answer the hotel.

790
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And I thought that was just like Christmas.

791
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.52
It's like, thank you.

792
00:41:50.52 --> 00:41:53.40
And I just, even though I didn't know whether that was true, whether they were going

793
00:41:53.40 --> 00:41:56.08
on to that, which they certainly weren't because they were trying to get in.

794
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:00.72
But it was like just what I needed to hear at that point to give me that sense of calm

795
00:42:00.72 --> 00:42:06.12
that I needed to focus on what it is I needed to do.

796
00:42:06.12 --> 00:42:11.60
In Missouri, I saw images and it was pretty prominent in the news back here, sort of as

797
00:42:11.60 --> 00:42:17.96
Cobbett fell, like, let's say there was like a women's clothing boutique.

798
00:42:17.96 --> 00:42:21.68
And then they chilled the next day to be gone, or it'd be now whatever selling shovels

799
00:42:21.68 --> 00:42:23.28
or something like that.

800
00:42:23.28 --> 00:42:28.60
And Missouri, go through that really rapid transition from, like, more Western influence

801
00:42:28.60 --> 00:42:30.36
just to boom overnight all of a sudden.

802
00:42:30.36 --> 00:42:31.60
Yeah, it was very overnight.

803
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:33.48
And mind you that was, that was self-sensorship.

804
00:42:33.48 --> 00:42:35.80
That wasn't the Taliban going around telling you in the head.

805
00:42:35.80 --> 00:42:38.92
Yeah, that was me going, oh, you know, I'm not going to be selling these weapons, freaking

806
00:42:38.92 --> 00:42:39.92
bikinis anymore.

807
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:40.92
Where's that in the down?

808
00:42:40.92 --> 00:42:41.92
Yeah.

809
00:42:41.92 --> 00:42:42.92
Yeah.

810
00:42:42.92 --> 00:42:44.72
So, yeah, Missouri really was just this drastic.

811
00:42:44.72 --> 00:42:47.60
But what I found fascinating was the clothing transformation.

812
00:42:47.60 --> 00:42:52.80
So, you see people walking around in western jeans or whatever it is, and then suddenly

813
00:42:52.80 --> 00:42:57.48
everybody's in F-kindress and very, very traditional.

814
00:42:57.48 --> 00:42:58.48
And that was sort of the bizarre thing.

815
00:42:58.48 --> 00:43:01.48
And it took a couple of days before I saw a woman again on the street.

816
00:43:01.48 --> 00:43:03.92
And when I did, she was always in a book.

817
00:43:03.92 --> 00:43:10.68
So that was very, it really felt like you went from one civilization and then you just

818
00:43:10.68 --> 00:43:13.80
plunged back a couple of hundred years overnight.

819
00:43:13.80 --> 00:43:17.88
And even just there were these messages coming out of the speakers, which I'd never heard

820
00:43:17.88 --> 00:43:19.72
before, and Missouri either.

821
00:43:19.72 --> 00:43:25.24
So the same speakers that they used for the call to prayer were suddenly delivering messages,

822
00:43:25.24 --> 00:43:30.12
sort of town hall messages to people, telling them that, you know, if anybody steals

823
00:43:30.12 --> 00:43:34.40
from them or anybody does anything and they're to call this number or come to this place

824
00:43:34.40 --> 00:43:35.40
to report it.

825
00:43:35.40 --> 00:43:40.80
And so you have this immediate sense of the teleband's trying to govern suddenly.

826
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:44.84
But yeah, it was so drastic that that transformation.

827
00:43:44.84 --> 00:43:48.04
So, how do you get up to the use back border?

828
00:43:48.04 --> 00:43:49.04
Just driving up there?

829
00:43:49.04 --> 00:43:50.04
Telebans.

830
00:43:50.04 --> 00:43:53.60
So the telebans took us, I know.

831
00:43:53.60 --> 00:43:58.04
So the telebans take us to the Uzbek border, which is back border is closed.

832
00:43:58.04 --> 00:44:04.76
But again, it's a couple of really amazing diplomats in Tashkent, which capital of Uzbekistan

833
00:44:04.76 --> 00:44:09.48
had made arrangements with Uzbek consulate to open the border, which actually found

834
00:44:09.48 --> 00:44:12.76
out I didn't even need because both of us had Australian passports and we didn't need

835
00:44:12.76 --> 00:44:15.40
a visa for Uzbekistan but Americans do.

836
00:44:15.40 --> 00:44:19.56
So I could have gone anyway I guess, but they had to open it specially for us because it

837
00:44:19.56 --> 00:44:23.68
was closed because they're not before when Masar had fallen or the night's before.

838
00:44:23.68 --> 00:44:28.64
When Masar had fallen, the soldiers flooded that border because they had nowhere else

839
00:44:28.64 --> 00:44:29.64
to go.

840
00:44:29.64 --> 00:44:33.88
So they really flooded that border and you drive along the way and you just see all the

841
00:44:33.88 --> 00:44:38.72
American vehicles and the homies and everything just abandoned and left behind and the

842
00:44:38.72 --> 00:44:43.92
weapons still lying on the road and the fatigues and these were just Afghan soldiers.

843
00:44:43.92 --> 00:44:46.36
And they were going for Uzbekistan.

844
00:44:46.36 --> 00:44:50.40
Yeah, because that was the closest route that they could go to get out.

845
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:53.60
So I think they let a certain amount in and then they just shut the border.

846
00:44:53.60 --> 00:45:00.92
How hard was it if I was a corporal or a private in the Afghan army and the Taliban's

847
00:45:00.92 --> 00:45:04.88
coming, how hard is it for me to be able to take off my uniform grab some traditional

848
00:45:04.88 --> 00:45:07.44
clothing and leave and get away with it?

849
00:45:07.44 --> 00:45:08.80
You wouldn't be able to get out of the country.

850
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:10.72
I mean, they weren't taking anyone.

851
00:45:10.72 --> 00:45:15.20
And how about my identity as far as I am just going to go back to my home wherever in

852
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:19.60
this village and just kind of take up life as a normal farmer or whatever?

853
00:45:19.60 --> 00:45:20.80
I mean, you could go and do that.

854
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:23.36
I think eventually they track you down and not.

855
00:45:23.36 --> 00:45:27.08
And I think this was also a bit of a misnorm that happened in the beginning.

856
00:45:27.08 --> 00:45:28.76
Was people were talking a lot, especially in the news.

857
00:45:28.76 --> 00:45:30.36
They were, oh, Taliban's got a list.

858
00:45:30.36 --> 00:45:31.36
They're coming to houses.

859
00:45:31.36 --> 00:45:34.64
They're getting, you know, XYZ, they're targeting so and so.

860
00:45:34.64 --> 00:45:40.64
And when I looked into it, they weren't really necessarily and of course there are exceptions.

861
00:45:40.64 --> 00:45:44.80
But their overall goal wasn't necessarily to target any of these soldiers.

862
00:45:44.80 --> 00:45:46.96
Their goal was to take back government weapons.

863
00:45:46.96 --> 00:45:52.52
So any government vehicles, any government issued guns, they needed to take them back.

864
00:45:52.52 --> 00:45:57.40
So the process is when somebody surrenders, they get, they hand over their weapon and they

865
00:45:57.40 --> 00:45:59.48
get given a letter from the Taliban.

866
00:45:59.48 --> 00:46:03.08
So the Taliban's give them a letter that basically says they've surrendered.

867
00:46:03.08 --> 00:46:05.44
This is then number that free to go.

868
00:46:05.44 --> 00:46:09.08
So, you know, when Taliban's approach some of these soldiers, you know, they either have

869
00:46:09.08 --> 00:46:12.52
to show the letter and if they don't have the letter, then the Taliban's will want to know

870
00:46:12.52 --> 00:46:17.000
where their weapon is and what they're doing kind of thing.

871
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.08
So yeah, it was muddy.

872
00:46:19.08 --> 00:46:22.64
Okay, so now you're a newsbackest man.

873
00:46:22.64 --> 00:46:25.04
You get there by what August 20th.

874
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:26.44
You're in a, who's back as Dan?

875
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:28.60
Yes, around August 20th.

876
00:46:28.60 --> 00:46:32.60
So at this time, it's getting, it's getting crazier in Afghanistan.

877
00:46:32.60 --> 00:46:38.04
You got bite and Biden is now on August 20th makes his promise that all Americans

878
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:40.24
to distance are going to be brought home.

879
00:46:40.24 --> 00:46:48.000
August 23rd, the CIA director William Burns meets with the leader of the Taliban or

880
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.04
one of the leaders of the Taliban.

881
00:46:50.04 --> 00:46:58.24
Well, co-founder of the Taliban, actually, to start talking about how we're going to withdraw.

882
00:46:58.24 --> 00:46:59.24
That starts to happen.

883
00:46:59.24 --> 00:47:00.80
The withdrawal starts happening.

884
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:10.20
August 26th, that's when this attack happens, kills 13 US military personnel, 11 Marines,

885
00:47:10.20 --> 00:47:23.96
one Navy corpsman, one American soldier, about 70 odd Afghan 180, 180, 180, 180.

886
00:47:23.96 --> 00:47:28.32
That happens on August 26th.

887
00:47:28.32 --> 00:47:40.32
Every night, there's a drone strike that is allegedly targeting some ISIS K or some Taliban

888
00:47:40.32 --> 00:47:49.52
or, and it ends up killing a USAID worker, a guy named Samari Ahmadi, kills him two other

889
00:47:49.52 --> 00:48:00.04
adults and seven kids.

890
00:48:00.04 --> 00:48:04.44
August 30th, there's some rocket attacks, but August 30th, we win the last US planes.

891
00:48:04.44 --> 00:48:06.88
We've Afghanistan.

892
00:48:06.88 --> 00:48:14.04
The Taliban rolls into the airport, just rolls into the airport and declares victory.

893
00:48:14.04 --> 00:48:15.04
So there it is.

894
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:22.04
The Taliban's in control, at which point is this when you go back in?

895
00:48:22.04 --> 00:48:27.60
Yeah, so I was working between his back a set and Tajikistan and I would have gone back

896
00:48:27.60 --> 00:48:34.24
or tried to go back a little earlier, but when I met with these diplomats, one of them

897
00:48:34.24 --> 00:48:40.52
sort of said to me, he had said, you know, because he was sort of involved in being, you know,

898
00:48:40.52 --> 00:48:45.08
he'd put him in touch with the middle man to leave Afghanistan and he'd sort of said, you

899
00:48:45.08 --> 00:48:50.56
know, I've been doing this for 30, 40 years and being in many wars are in sort of working

900
00:48:50.56 --> 00:48:56.28
and he said, I've never felt more terrified when then I basically handed you over to the

901
00:48:56.28 --> 00:49:02.48
Taliban to get in their car to leave and he said, I just, I was so relieved when you

902
00:49:02.48 --> 00:49:07.28
were okay and I add a respect to him, I didn't want to go back in straight away.

903
00:49:07.28 --> 00:49:10.92
So, but there was never doubt in my mind that I was going to go back in, of course,

904
00:49:10.92 --> 00:49:16.96
I didn't tell that to my parents or do anybody else, but I thought I'd plan to come

905
00:49:16.96 --> 00:49:18.88
and do a job.

906
00:49:18.88 --> 00:49:24.20
I felt confident enough to go back because despite the hype that we were sort of seeing

907
00:49:24.20 --> 00:49:28.80
in the media and everybody trying to get out, I did know other sort of British journalists

908
00:49:28.80 --> 00:49:34.64
and things that had stayed that was still in Kabul and I felt confident enough that I could

909
00:49:34.64 --> 00:49:42.12
go back and be okay about it and so we made that decision to go back and I thought, you know,

910
00:49:42.12 --> 00:49:47.08
I'll let this airport chaos die down and so we'll go back in on the first and we'll drive

911
00:49:47.08 --> 00:49:53.04
back from the north, back from Uzbekistan border and we'll take that, it's about a 12 hour

912
00:49:53.04 --> 00:49:58.24
drive across Afghanistan, back to Kabul because there really wasn't any other way.

913
00:49:58.24 --> 00:50:00.52
And yeah, that's what we did.

914
00:50:00.52 --> 00:50:06.56
Okay, me, we crossed that bridge again and I still, and they were honoring the valid

915
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:07.56
visas.

916
00:50:07.56 --> 00:50:12.64
So, my visa was valid, media visa and so I went back and we kind of went to this little

917
00:50:12.64 --> 00:50:17.08
passport hot and I was just a Taliban sitting in there and you didn't ask a single question,

918
00:50:17.08 --> 00:50:22.88
just had a notebook, wrote it down, stamped with the Taliban stamp and we were good to go.

919
00:50:22.88 --> 00:50:28.16
So it was sort of that easy to go back and I thought, gosh.

920
00:50:28.16 --> 00:50:29.64
And then you're just driving south.

921
00:50:29.64 --> 00:50:34.12
And we're just driving, so we'd hired a driver for friends of a friend who'd come to pick

922
00:50:34.12 --> 00:50:40.84
us up and so there was, all of his jammed into this little Toyota Corolla driving from that

923
00:50:40.84 --> 00:50:46.24
bridge down just through selling paths down into, yeah, it was about 12 hours.

924
00:50:46.24 --> 00:50:47.68
Are you in your getting the checkpoints?

925
00:50:47.68 --> 00:50:50.14
Yeah, so there was about 16 checkpoints.

926
00:50:50.14 --> 00:50:52.04
And was that feel like?

927
00:50:52.04 --> 00:50:55.12
You know, they, and still now, they barely stop you when they see a woman.

928
00:50:55.12 --> 00:50:57.12
They see a woman go, go, go, go, go.

929
00:50:57.12 --> 00:51:00.52
They've been basically instructed, at least definitely at that point they're instructed,

930
00:51:00.52 --> 00:51:04.96
don't question a woman, don't, you know, if there's a woman in the car, just let them go.

931
00:51:04.96 --> 00:51:05.96
Why so?

932
00:51:05.96 --> 00:51:08.16
They're terrified of women.

933
00:51:08.16 --> 00:51:13.08
They, they, yeah, they just, they think they see it as a sign of respect.

934
00:51:13.08 --> 00:51:17.96
Don't question a woman, don't ask her who she don't look at her, don't question.

935
00:51:17.96 --> 00:51:22.48
Really only once we got stopped, I think at a checkpoint, they asked a sort of a few

936
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:27.000
questions, looked at the passports and one of them poxies had through the window, the

937
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.44
one, it was, again, it's like being a clown show.

938
00:51:30.44 --> 00:51:33.44
And Jake said to this guy, how did you get your hair so shiny?

939
00:51:33.44 --> 00:51:37.36
Because they've got this black hair that's letting around and the guy looks he goes, had

940
00:51:37.36 --> 00:51:38.36
and shoulders.

941
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:40.12
It was the whole thing.

942
00:51:40.12 --> 00:51:46.24
It was like, I don't know what movie I'm in right now, but this is crazy.

943
00:51:46.24 --> 00:51:50.84
But yeah, so they barely got stopped at a checkpoint and suddenly we're back in Kabul.

944
00:51:50.84 --> 00:51:55.88
And really at that point, the only, it's fighting that was really still happening was in

945
00:51:55.88 --> 00:52:02.48
Pangea and that was sort of the last holdout that the Taliban's hadn't taken yet.

946
00:52:02.48 --> 00:52:05.04
So, and you ended up going up there, right?

947
00:52:05.04 --> 00:52:06.04
Yes.

948
00:52:06.04 --> 00:52:11.84
And the reason you go, well, because there was, there was anti-talivan forces that fled

949
00:52:11.84 --> 00:52:12.84
there.

950
00:52:12.84 --> 00:52:13.84
Yes.

951
00:52:13.84 --> 00:52:18.04
And they were flying the flag of the Northern Alliance up there.

952
00:52:18.04 --> 00:52:27.28
And it seemed like that could be sort of like the Montana or the, you know what I'm saying?

953
00:52:27.28 --> 00:52:32.000
Like the Wyoming of, hey, hey, they might have taken the rest of America, this is like a red

954
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.72
dawn scenario, right?

955
00:52:33.72 --> 00:52:35.04
These are the Wolverines up there.

956
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:36.72
Thinking, all right, we're going to go up there.

957
00:52:36.72 --> 00:52:37.72
Do you know what I'm talking about?

958
00:52:37.72 --> 00:52:38.72
Yes.

959
00:52:38.72 --> 00:52:42.68
Okay, because I know Eco does, you know, he's very up to speed on those kind of movies,

960
00:52:42.68 --> 00:52:44.28
but that's what it was.

961
00:52:44.28 --> 00:52:48.000
That's what it seemed like, up in Pangea was, hey, we've got, this is the last holdout

962
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
we're like the Wolverines up there.

963
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Yeah.

964
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.16
We were flying the old flag of the Northern Alliance and we've got experienced fighters.

965
00:52:58.16 --> 00:52:59.16
You're hearing that story.

966
00:52:59.16 --> 00:53:02.76
Did you looking at it think that they could hold out?

967
00:53:02.76 --> 00:53:04.80
So I was hearing a lot of information with people.

968
00:53:04.80 --> 00:53:07.36
We're going to do this, this, this and this.

969
00:53:07.36 --> 00:53:09.48
And I've spent a lot of time in Pangea previously.

970
00:53:09.48 --> 00:53:13.08
And I knew that there was a lot of great fighters, great guy, you know, people that, that

971
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:15.000
fought during the Soviet occupation.

972
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.52
And that was the only place the Taliban's never controlled during their reign in the

973
00:53:18.52 --> 00:53:19.52
90s.

974
00:53:19.52 --> 00:53:21.96
They never got Pangea, that was the one place.

975
00:53:21.96 --> 00:53:26.68
So they certainly had this mentality to hold, but at the same time, all the young men

976
00:53:26.68 --> 00:53:30.12
that I knew that had lived there, it all fled to France, all of them.

977
00:53:30.12 --> 00:53:33.72
And I'm thinking, why have you fled to France?

978
00:53:33.72 --> 00:53:36.12
Like you should be here finding for your province.

979
00:53:36.12 --> 00:53:37.12
Like what is going on?

980
00:53:37.12 --> 00:53:41.72
So it was a little skeptical to be honest because I was hearing, especially from contact

981
00:53:41.72 --> 00:53:45.28
somebody in the US who were like, where can I send them weapons and get this?

982
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:51.12
And I remember just sort of thinking, I don't know if I'm buying this right now.

983
00:53:51.12 --> 00:53:55.20
So we decided, yeah, I was like, I need to get in.

984
00:53:55.20 --> 00:53:56.88
And there was still this debate going on.

985
00:53:56.88 --> 00:53:57.88
Has it fallen?

986
00:53:57.88 --> 00:53:59.08
Has it not fallen?

987
00:53:59.08 --> 00:54:03.52
Because the Taliban's were claiming in that sort of first week of September to have

988
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:04.52
taken it.

989
00:54:04.52 --> 00:54:10.04
But then the NRF, as they know, in the national resistance front, were saying, no, no, no, we're still

990
00:54:10.04 --> 00:54:11.36
in control.

991
00:54:11.36 --> 00:54:13.44
And so nobody could figure it out because nobody could get in.

992
00:54:13.44 --> 00:54:17.40
The Taliban's were not letting anybody go into the province.

993
00:54:17.40 --> 00:54:19.60
And there's really terrible cell service there.

994
00:54:19.60 --> 00:54:21.68
It's always been terrible cell service there.

995
00:54:21.68 --> 00:54:25.64
So especially if you're in the mountains, you're not going to be able to report back.

996
00:54:25.64 --> 00:54:29.08
So there was this really crazy debate going on.

997
00:54:29.08 --> 00:54:34.84
And again, whether misinformation was coming out of was this idea of, then people started

998
00:54:34.84 --> 00:54:37.28
saying, the Pakistan has got drawings there.

999
00:54:37.28 --> 00:54:38.96
And they're supporting the Taliban's.

1000
00:54:38.96 --> 00:54:43.08
And I looked at the video and then I was like, that's a video game.

1001
00:54:43.08 --> 00:54:46.88
Like they're using footage, like news outlets are using footage of a video game.

1002
00:54:46.88 --> 00:54:51.20
And also footage of like, a US military in Arizona.

1003
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:56.08
And it's been passed off as the Pakistan is in Pangea.

1004
00:54:56.08 --> 00:55:00.32
And I just remember thinking, what, it was this complete disinformation circle.

1005
00:55:00.32 --> 00:55:04.40
And when I really started to dig into it, I found that it was a lot of the disinformation

1006
00:55:04.40 --> 00:55:06.08
was coming from India.

1007
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:12.44
So basically, Pangea had become this proxy for the conflict between Pakistan and India.

1008
00:55:12.44 --> 00:55:17.04
And they were sending different information, a lot of which was completely inaccurate.

1009
00:55:17.04 --> 00:55:22.48
So I said to my fixer, I mean, to do whatever it takes to get into Pangea.

1010
00:55:22.48 --> 00:55:25.44
Because I need to know, has it fallen, has it fallen?

1011
00:55:25.44 --> 00:55:27.56
What is going on there?

1012
00:55:27.56 --> 00:55:30.40
And so he was able to make that arrangement.

1013
00:55:30.40 --> 00:55:33.88
And we were sort of the first journalist that were able to get in and go through all

1014
00:55:33.88 --> 00:55:39.12
like districts. And that was about, that was, I want to say, it was about September 9.

1015
00:55:39.12 --> 00:55:42.84
I think I did, we went to Pangea.

1016
00:55:42.84 --> 00:55:43.84
And did you drive up there?

1017
00:55:43.84 --> 00:55:44.48
Yeah, we drove.

1018
00:55:44.48 --> 00:55:45.92
So it's not far from Kabul.

1019
00:55:45.92 --> 00:55:47.68
It's about an hour and a half.

1020
00:55:47.68 --> 00:55:49.000
And then we get there.

1021
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.56
And it was very heavily fortified by the Taliban.

1022
00:55:51.56 --> 00:55:52.68
And we get in.

1023
00:55:52.68 --> 00:55:57.88
And immediately it was very clear to me that the Taliban had complete control of it.

1024
00:55:57.88 --> 00:56:01.84
Even, even, yeah, there was just so much misinformation.

1025
00:56:01.84 --> 00:56:03.84
Did you talk to any anti-refiters?

1026
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:04.84
Yeah, I did.

1027
00:56:04.84 --> 00:56:07.28
And most, I was watching them surrender from the mountains.

1028
00:56:07.28 --> 00:56:11.52
And they were coming down and handing their guns over to the Taliban's and the Taliban's

1029
00:56:11.52 --> 00:56:13.24
were giving them the letter.

1030
00:56:13.24 --> 00:56:14.52
And off they were going.

1031
00:56:14.52 --> 00:56:15.52
And they were leaving.

1032
00:56:15.52 --> 00:56:19.68
And honestly, and I got so much heat for this.

1033
00:56:19.68 --> 00:56:23.76
But you know, you can only report what you're seeing here.

1034
00:56:23.76 --> 00:56:24.88
They really wasn't a fight.

1035
00:56:24.88 --> 00:56:25.88
It wasn't a big fight.

1036
00:56:25.88 --> 00:56:27.92
A lot of that was exaggerated.

1037
00:56:27.92 --> 00:56:32.16
There was not a single amount of damage that I saw anywhere in that main street.

1038
00:56:32.16 --> 00:56:35.28
Not to say there wasn't fighting in the mountains.

1039
00:56:35.28 --> 00:56:39.72
But I didn't, I had one rocket launch that entire day that I was there.

1040
00:56:39.72 --> 00:56:41.16
The leadership had fled.

1041
00:56:41.16 --> 00:56:44.96
They'd already left.

1042
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:48.32
And I just think that was just sort of, and I still hear it now about, you know, people

1043
00:56:48.32 --> 00:56:52.68
going around trying to get weapons, trying to, you know, it's not there.

1044
00:56:52.68 --> 00:56:56.96
It doesn't exist the way it existed 30 years ago.

1045
00:56:56.96 --> 00:57:01.40
And again, goes back to so many of them that I knew they're not in the country anymore.

1046
00:57:01.40 --> 00:57:03.08
But you know, and it was crazy.

1047
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:06.36
I got so much heat for simply reporting.

1048
00:57:06.36 --> 00:57:08.44
They really wasn't a fight here.

1049
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:13.52
And the diaspora just came off to me and people, you know, just I never experienced that

1050
00:57:13.52 --> 00:57:16.60
kind of backlash just from reporting a story.

1051
00:57:16.60 --> 00:57:20.72
So I was kind of relieved when some friends of mine from Wall Street Journal in New York

1052
00:57:20.72 --> 00:57:21.72
Times and things.

1053
00:57:21.72 --> 00:57:23.96
They went in a couple weeks later and reported the same thing.

1054
00:57:23.96 --> 00:57:27.84
So I was like, well, okay, I'm not crazy.

1055
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:28.84
Yeah.

1056
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:34.92
And then, you know, when you talk about the folks that you knew that went to France,

1057
00:57:34.92 --> 00:57:37.32
like, give us a little bit of background on that.

1058
00:57:37.32 --> 00:57:40.04
Well, it was just in that initial evacuation period.

1059
00:57:40.04 --> 00:57:45.96
Just a lot of the young fighters that I knew that France was very close with the panjuries.

1060
00:57:45.96 --> 00:57:49.32
And I'm much more matured, his wife lives there.

1061
00:57:49.32 --> 00:57:51.84
And he spent a lot of time there during his time.

1062
00:57:51.84 --> 00:57:55.36
And so they have a very close relationship and the franchise are very aligned with the

1063
00:57:55.36 --> 00:58:00.52
panjuries. So they were mostly able, a lot of the men were able to get, I guess, SIVs to

1064
00:58:00.52 --> 00:58:02.96
go to France in that evacuation period.

1065
00:58:02.96 --> 00:58:05.16
And a lot of them took it and I'll say, went.

1066
00:58:05.16 --> 00:58:10.36
And so, yeah, I don't doubt there was certainly a fight there.

1067
00:58:10.36 --> 00:58:15.52
But I just think it was really blown out of proportion in terms of any ability to take it.

1068
00:58:15.52 --> 00:58:20.04
It was very clear that Talaman had full control of every single of those districts.

1069
00:58:20.04 --> 00:58:23.40
So you spend what how long would it have for a day?

1070
00:58:23.40 --> 00:58:24.40
Yeah.

1071
00:58:24.40 --> 00:58:25.40
And you spend a day up there.

1072
00:58:25.40 --> 00:58:30.48
And now, at this point now, the Taliban is forming their government.

1073
00:58:30.48 --> 00:58:36.20
And yeah, they now run the country, they formed their government.

1074
00:58:36.20 --> 00:58:39.28
September 11th, they kind of formally announced that they're in control.

1075
00:58:39.28 --> 00:58:41.32
And this is the new regime.

1076
00:58:41.32 --> 00:58:42.32
Yeah.

1077
00:58:42.32 --> 00:58:48.40
They reopened the Ministry for the Prevention of Ice and Propagation of Virtue, which

1078
00:58:48.40 --> 00:58:53.96
is something that existed in their first reign, where they would go around with these morality

1079
00:58:53.96 --> 00:58:56.16
police and school people.

1080
00:58:56.16 --> 00:59:00.52
And people would get flogged if your beard wasn't long enough or for women's, you

1081
00:59:00.52 --> 00:59:03.20
know, wasn't wearing the correct burka.

1082
00:59:03.20 --> 00:59:05.20
So they were very stringent about that.

1083
00:59:05.20 --> 00:59:07.68
They haven't restarted the morality police.

1084
00:59:07.68 --> 00:59:10.12
But at the beginning, it was a little bit terrifying.

1085
00:59:10.12 --> 00:59:15.48
And I went to the opening of the Ministry and we sort of just, it was very bizarre that

1086
00:59:15.48 --> 00:59:20.48
very first month, you could just walk up and knock on a door anywhere and get in.

1087
00:59:20.48 --> 00:59:22.28
They tightened down since then.

1088
00:59:22.28 --> 00:59:24.84
But it was suddenly just how to all this access to things.

1089
00:59:24.84 --> 00:59:29.16
And because the Taliban's were not used to all this media and people and it was very

1090
00:59:29.16 --> 00:59:30.16
bizarre for them.

1091
00:59:30.16 --> 00:59:32.16
So they were just sort of show, come in.

1092
00:59:32.16 --> 00:59:34.44
What's your opening line?

1093
00:59:34.44 --> 00:59:38.72
You walk up to the Ministry of Prevention of Ice and Propagation of Virtue.

1094
00:59:38.72 --> 00:59:40.16
What do you say when you knock on their door?

1095
00:59:40.16 --> 00:59:42.24
We just come and I go with my fix from my photographer.

1096
00:59:42.24 --> 00:59:44.72
And of course, I don't look at me.

1097
00:59:44.72 --> 00:59:47.72
They, you know, that was the other bizarre thing too.

1098
00:59:47.72 --> 00:59:55.80
I, the psychological effect of being ignored and invisible for a month straight is actually

1099
00:59:55.80 --> 00:59:58.60
to say, it made me get a little bit crazy.

1100
00:59:58.60 --> 01:00:02.000
So but I would make a deliberate at first for the first few weeks.

1101
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.44
I was being trying to be polite.

1102
01:00:03.44 --> 01:00:08.72
I would stand back and just let them go up and, you know, handle it and do their impestion

1103
01:00:08.72 --> 01:00:11.72
greetings with the Taliban's and make us the questions.

1104
01:00:11.72 --> 01:00:13.56
And I would just be in the background.

1105
01:00:13.56 --> 01:00:14.56
They would interview with me.

1106
01:00:14.56 --> 01:00:15.56
They didn't like it.

1107
01:00:15.56 --> 01:00:16.56
They would complain.

1108
01:00:16.56 --> 01:00:19.32
They would bring a woman, you know, which I should be interviewing with the man.

1109
01:00:19.32 --> 01:00:23.80
But they would usually, and my fixer would say, well, she'll go and write about it.

1110
01:00:23.80 --> 01:00:26.40
She'll go and write about the fact that you aren't going to interview her.

1111
01:00:26.40 --> 01:00:30.24
So then they were very worried about perception at that point.

1112
01:00:30.24 --> 01:00:34.60
But so we, we'd go up and they were doing this, you know, big opening for there, you

1113
01:00:34.60 --> 01:00:36.88
know, all the guys went in and I couldn't go in.

1114
01:00:36.88 --> 01:00:38.88
So my photographer and fixer went in.

1115
01:00:38.88 --> 01:00:41.36
I was allowed to go into the compound.

1116
01:00:41.36 --> 01:00:45.08
And some of the Taliban's bought me a chair and I'm sitting under the tree.

1117
01:00:45.08 --> 01:00:49.80
And they're all, you know, doing the, the Hakani's and everybody's in the building

1118
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:52.12
next to me doing their, their summons.

1119
01:00:52.12 --> 01:00:54.72
And then finally they said, oh, we need to put her in a room.

1120
01:00:54.72 --> 01:00:55.92
She can't sit here.

1121
01:00:55.92 --> 01:01:01.24
So I get moved to a room and they bring me tea and fruit and it was all just very bizarre.

1122
01:01:01.24 --> 01:01:05.84
And then finally when the celebrations had finished and they're all doing picnics outside,

1123
01:01:05.84 --> 01:01:10.28
the director came to interview me in the, in the little room and he would just sort of sit

1124
01:01:10.28 --> 01:01:14.40
there and very softly spoke in and what else are my questions.

1125
01:01:14.40 --> 01:01:15.92
But looking at the ground.

1126
01:01:15.92 --> 01:01:21.76
So I was, yeah, I was very invisible, which at first I took, I said, you know, I'll be,

1127
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:25.68
you know, I went with the approach that they're not used.

1128
01:01:25.68 --> 01:01:27.32
They've never seen a woman before.

1129
01:01:27.32 --> 01:01:30.88
Especially not a woman working out with men.

1130
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:36.08
They, if lucky, they've seen their mothers, daughter if they have one in the sister, they

1131
01:01:36.08 --> 01:01:38.40
really have not seen a woman before.

1132
01:01:38.40 --> 01:01:41.08
So I tried to be like, well, this is very new to me.

1133
01:01:41.08 --> 01:01:42.44
And you went in a burger or no?

1134
01:01:42.44 --> 01:01:43.44
No, nope.

1135
01:01:43.44 --> 01:01:44.44
I was confused.

1136
01:01:44.44 --> 01:01:47.66
I wore everything that I normally wore and I've got to stand previously, just a

1137
01:01:47.66 --> 01:01:49.16
had job.

1138
01:01:49.16 --> 01:01:53.24
And sometimes I wore a mask, depending, but I refuse to wear a burger or if you're

1139
01:01:53.24 --> 01:01:56.76
still wearing a quibbo, refuse to wear anything other than a had job.

1140
01:01:56.76 --> 01:02:00.04
Because that's all it says in Islam is cover the head and that's it.

1141
01:02:00.04 --> 01:02:01.04
So that's what I went with.

1142
01:02:01.04 --> 01:02:04.72
So I thought, you know, this is a very big learning experience for them, too.

1143
01:02:04.72 --> 01:02:07.52
And even when I would go to villages, it was so bizarre.

1144
01:02:07.52 --> 01:02:09.72
You could hear the villages in the background.

1145
01:02:09.72 --> 01:02:15.32
She had a man or a woman, like they just never seen, it was just so new to them.

1146
01:02:15.32 --> 01:02:17.56
And so at the beginning, I was respectful.

1147
01:02:17.56 --> 01:02:18.96
And then I snapped.

1148
01:02:18.96 --> 01:02:25.24
I, I, I, I, I just, when you're ignored completely for that long, I just thought, I'm

1149
01:02:25.24 --> 01:02:27.80
not okay with this anymore.

1150
01:02:27.80 --> 01:02:34.56
And so I made a very big point of any time we went to meet with the Taliban's that I was

1151
01:02:34.56 --> 01:02:35.76
with my photographer from Fixer.

1152
01:02:35.76 --> 01:02:38.28
I would walk up and I would just stare at them.

1153
01:02:38.28 --> 01:02:40.88
I'd say, hi, and I would stare at them.

1154
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:42.24
And they looked the other way.

1155
01:02:42.24 --> 01:02:45.48
And even an interview when they would speak and they would just look at my fixer and not

1156
01:02:45.48 --> 01:02:48.24
to me, I would continue to stare at them.

1157
01:02:48.24 --> 01:02:50.52
And 95% of the time they broke.

1158
01:02:50.52 --> 01:02:54.16
95% of the time, eventually they started to look at me.

1159
01:02:54.16 --> 01:02:59.000
And throughout the course of my months there, I found that by the end, the most of them were

1160
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.32
actually looking at me.

1161
01:03:00.32 --> 01:03:07.32
And I thought, I don't want to go and perpetuate this idea of, it's okay just to, nor

1162
01:03:07.32 --> 01:03:09.92
one, and even though, to a lot of them, that is respect.

1163
01:03:09.92 --> 01:03:13.20
They think it's respectful to not look at me or ignore me.

1164
01:03:13.20 --> 01:03:17.88
And I thought, if you're, I'll going to run this country, you need to learn what that is

1165
01:03:17.88 --> 01:03:18.88
going to entail.

1166
01:03:18.88 --> 01:03:22.80
And that is going to be that women are working in the street.

1167
01:03:22.80 --> 01:03:23.80
That's how it is.

1168
01:03:23.80 --> 01:03:26.24
Foreign women will come in and work.

1169
01:03:26.24 --> 01:03:30.44
So it's just an interesting social experiment, but I could, yeah, staring at them.

1170
01:03:30.44 --> 01:03:35.68
So there was like a line, because, you know, early, early, you said, you know, that

1171
01:03:35.68 --> 01:03:39.64
when the Taliban would look at you, and you were like, oh, when the cars, they was wavering

1172
01:03:39.64 --> 01:03:41.48
through checkpoints, because it's a sign of respect.

1173
01:03:41.48 --> 01:03:44.24
But then when you're actually trying to communicate with them, and they're just not even

1174
01:03:44.24 --> 01:03:46.40
looking at you, whether they are, when they are afraid.

1175
01:03:46.40 --> 01:03:48.12
Yeah, it's just what they taught.

1176
01:03:48.12 --> 01:03:50.24
They taught to never look at a woman.

1177
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:55.60
It's just, it's indoctrination that it's disrespectful to look at a woman.

1178
01:03:55.60 --> 01:03:58.64
That's not your own wife or your mother.

1179
01:03:58.64 --> 01:04:00.88
That's the way that they're taught.

1180
01:04:00.88 --> 01:04:07.36
So I understand that, but they're also going to have to learn.

1181
01:04:07.36 --> 01:04:08.88
That's not always going to be the way.

1182
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:13.04
Yeah, and you said, hey, it's not going to, this is the way it's going to have to be in

1183
01:04:13.04 --> 01:04:14.04
the future.

1184
01:04:14.04 --> 01:04:15.04
But do you think it'll be that way?

1185
01:04:15.04 --> 01:04:16.04
Where do you think I'll just not allow it?

1186
01:04:16.04 --> 01:04:19.04
I saw a big shift over that few months.

1187
01:04:19.04 --> 01:04:23.56
Again, I tried to take the approach of, as much as this is new for me, this is new for

1188
01:04:23.56 --> 01:04:24.56
them, too.

1189
01:04:24.56 --> 01:04:26.92
They've never been in a media spotlight the way they are now.

1190
01:04:26.92 --> 01:04:30.44
They've never had all this social media or an attention.

1191
01:04:30.44 --> 01:04:33.16
And so they're never getting something new as well.

1192
01:04:33.16 --> 01:04:40.48
And so I think that, I hope that they've learned, I did see a change in an over that period

1193
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:46.28
just in their interaction.

1194
01:04:46.28 --> 01:04:50.44
I know you actually, I talked about that drone strike earlier.

1195
01:04:50.44 --> 01:04:55.000
And I know that at one point you actually, twice I went and met with the family at the

1196
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.88
house where it was hit.

1197
01:04:56.88 --> 01:04:57.88
Yeah.

1198
01:04:57.88 --> 01:04:58.88
Talk us through that.

1199
01:04:58.88 --> 01:04:59.88
Yeah, that was devastating.

1200
01:04:59.88 --> 01:05:06.72
So yeah, on the edge of Kabul, very small, you know, sort of in a published area,

1201
01:05:06.72 --> 01:05:12.36
we went to see that family on that first day that basically that the Pentagon had acknowledged

1202
01:05:12.36 --> 01:05:15.40
that, okay, it was a mistake.

1203
01:05:15.40 --> 01:05:16.60
And it was heartbreaking.

1204
01:05:16.60 --> 01:05:18.72
It was absolutely heartbreaking.

1205
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:22.12
And one of the, you know, three brothers that were all sort of living there with all their

1206
01:05:22.12 --> 01:05:27.68
family and waiting to get that call to go to the airport to evacuate.

1207
01:05:27.68 --> 01:05:32.92
And one of them, the men had lost all these kids, all these three kids were killed.

1208
01:05:32.92 --> 01:05:37.24
And another one, two of them, just, it was heartbreaking.

1209
01:05:37.24 --> 01:05:39.68
The car was all still there.

1210
01:05:39.68 --> 01:05:44.64
And I just, I kind of imagine that the guy had gone to work that day.

1211
01:05:44.64 --> 01:05:46.60
He was working for an NGO.

1212
01:05:46.60 --> 01:05:49.96
And they sort of had a ritual where the little kids would run up to the car when it came

1213
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:50.96
in.

1214
01:05:50.96 --> 01:05:56.20
And he would, you know, then they jump in the car and they drive into the house.

1215
01:05:56.20 --> 01:05:59.64
And so he came back in five o'clock that afternoon.

1216
01:05:59.64 --> 01:06:03.76
And that's when the drone hit and the kids, it all sort of ran out to get the car and

1217
01:06:03.76 --> 01:06:04.76
jumped in.

1218
01:06:04.76 --> 01:06:08.28
And that's when they were hit with the drone.

1219
01:06:08.28 --> 01:06:13.32
And it was just, it was never stating, you know, the mothers who just who could not speak.

1220
01:06:13.32 --> 01:06:21.52
And I went back to follow up with them a couple of, I guess it would have been in November.

1221
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:23.24
So, late November.

1222
01:06:23.24 --> 01:06:28.84
So recently, and, you know, I said, has anybody, because there were reports that you've

1223
01:06:28.84 --> 01:06:34.08
been compensated, the US was going to give them compensation and also speed up their visas

1224
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:39.16
to come because some of them did qualify for SIVs and had applied for them before the

1225
01:06:39.16 --> 01:06:40.16
evacuation.

1226
01:06:40.16 --> 01:06:42.60
So before any of this had happened.

1227
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:44.76
And they said, you know, we haven't had a thing.

1228
01:06:44.76 --> 01:06:48.56
We have nobody's apologized, nobody's contacted us.

1229
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:54.60
And in the US kind of saying, oh, we're going to give these people compensation, it endangered

1230
01:06:54.60 --> 01:06:58.64
them further because then people around, they'll, well, these people have money now.

1231
01:06:58.64 --> 01:07:01.72
And, you know, and crime in Afghanistan is terrible as it is.

1232
01:07:01.72 --> 01:07:05.24
And so suddenly, these people were under an extra layer of threat on top of it.

1233
01:07:05.24 --> 01:07:10.28
So I don't know what sort of happened if anything's transpired over the last couple of weeks.

1234
01:07:10.28 --> 01:07:14.72
I tried to put them in touch with a rescue organization that was going to help them get

1235
01:07:14.72 --> 01:07:18.52
out and speed up and they said, oh, you know, we're supposedly in contact with

1236
01:07:18.52 --> 01:07:23.16
some lawyers in DC, but I don't know that anything ever came out of that either or, you

1237
01:07:23.16 --> 01:07:24.76
know, if they were able to get out.

1238
01:07:24.76 --> 01:07:28.32
But it was really just heartbreaking in many levels.

1239
01:07:28.32 --> 01:07:31.24
And what's fascinating is that they weren't bit of people.

1240
01:07:31.24 --> 01:07:35.48
They were not angry at the US.

1241
01:07:35.48 --> 01:07:39.36
They were not, you know, they didn't want to try to get revenge.

1242
01:07:39.36 --> 01:07:40.84
They want to come to the US.

1243
01:07:40.84 --> 01:07:45.28
You know, they still wanted to come and live here and get out of Afghanistan.

1244
01:07:45.28 --> 01:07:49.48
But yeah, I just hope that that that case isn't lost.

1245
01:07:49.48 --> 01:07:57.28
Is there any news or information about the sort of intel thread that led to that drone strike?

1246
01:07:57.28 --> 01:08:02.20
I mean, only from what I've read out of reports was just it seemed like a, I guess, a perfect

1247
01:08:02.20 --> 01:08:05.36
storm of fire, really, just seemed that.

1248
01:08:05.36 --> 01:08:10.56
And again, I'm still trying to understand it was like you were targeting a Toyota Corolla.

1249
01:08:10.56 --> 01:08:14.84
We'll 70% of the cars in Kabul, a Toyota Corolla.

1250
01:08:14.84 --> 01:08:18.60
So I just think it seemed like a perfect storm from many different level.

1251
01:08:18.60 --> 01:08:23.92
And I think the US was in panic mode at that point having had the airport attack a couple

1252
01:08:23.92 --> 01:08:24.92
of days earlier.

1253
01:08:24.92 --> 01:08:29.36
And we were so terrified that this guy who was pulling water out of his car was pulling

1254
01:08:29.36 --> 01:08:31.16
explosives out of the car.

1255
01:08:31.16 --> 01:08:39.56
And yeah, it all just seemed to come together without, I guess, the correct due diligence.

1256
01:08:39.56 --> 01:08:48.44
I've done targets before hit targets that were just, there was wrong.

1257
01:08:48.44 --> 01:08:49.80
And I was a huge lesson learned from you.

1258
01:08:49.80 --> 01:08:55.08
I hit a target one time at first deployment to Iraq and pulled the thread on the, because

1259
01:08:55.08 --> 01:08:57.16
I got back thinking that was not right.

1260
01:08:57.16 --> 01:09:00.24
Like, that person with the guy that we got is not a bad guy.

1261
01:09:00.24 --> 01:09:02.36
You clearly was not a bad guy.

1262
01:09:02.36 --> 01:09:06.20
And it came back and started pulling the thread, hey, who, who did this, who gave us this

1263
01:09:06.20 --> 01:09:15.12
information and eventually pulled the thread and it was like, he had, his wife had fired

1264
01:09:15.12 --> 01:09:17.96
the maid or something like that.

1265
01:09:17.96 --> 01:09:19.20
It was something like that.

1266
01:09:19.20 --> 01:09:21.28
The maid was pissed.

1267
01:09:21.28 --> 01:09:27.40
And so she went and started telling Americans that, oh, yeah, this guy, he's a bad guy,

1268
01:09:27.40 --> 01:09:28.60
he's financing.

1269
01:09:28.60 --> 01:09:32.24
You know, that kind of thing.

1270
01:09:32.24 --> 01:09:34.20
And so that was a huge lesson for me.

1271
01:09:34.20 --> 01:09:38.08
This is from then on, my, my question would be, who put this X on this building?

1272
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:42.48
Because that's what we would literally get would be a map and there'd be an X on the

1273
01:09:42.48 --> 01:09:46.08
building, a red X just like a movie, a red X on a building.

1274
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:48.92
And I would say, who'd put that red X there?

1275
01:09:48.92 --> 01:09:52.60
I want to know who put that red X and now I would pull the thread and find out exactly,

1276
01:09:52.60 --> 01:09:54.48
hey, this is the information that we got.

1277
01:09:54.48 --> 01:09:55.64
This is what's corroborated.

1278
01:09:55.64 --> 01:09:59.20
It's really, really hard.

1279
01:09:59.20 --> 01:10:03.72
And if you're not in that mode and there's pressure, that's where these people make

1280
01:10:03.72 --> 01:10:07.92
these quick calls to try and do something.

1281
01:10:07.92 --> 01:10:11.76
And again, I don't, I want to pull the thread on that more.

1282
01:10:11.76 --> 01:10:14.84
And hopefully I can try and as it becomes declassified.

1283
01:10:14.84 --> 01:10:18.000
Because I'm sure some of it's classified whether getting information from all that stuff

1284
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.32
can be classified.

1285
01:10:19.32 --> 01:10:26.04
But it'll be interesting to pull the thread on that and see why they pulled the trigger on that

1286
01:10:26.04 --> 01:10:27.04
mission.

1287
01:10:27.04 --> 01:10:29.80
And the report came back saying nobody was responsible.

1288
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:31.000
Nobody was how to cannibal.

1289
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.52
It was just a mistake that they couldn't sort of pin to one person was the Pentagon report

1290
01:10:35.52 --> 01:10:36.52
on it.

1291
01:10:36.52 --> 01:10:39.16
I thought, how is that possible?

1292
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:43.48
And how is nobody held accountable to this at all?

1293
01:10:43.48 --> 01:10:50.36
Well, you know, even for me, when we hit that target and caught this guy, thank God we

1294
01:10:50.36 --> 01:10:51.36
didn't shoot him.

1295
01:10:51.36 --> 01:10:52.36
Thank God he didn't resist.

1296
01:10:52.36 --> 01:10:53.36
He didn't resist because he wasn't a bad guy.

1297
01:10:53.36 --> 01:10:55.12
So we went, we grabbed this guy.

1298
01:10:55.12 --> 01:11:00.68
But the reason I wanted was so engaged with that was because I knew it was me.

1299
01:11:00.68 --> 01:11:06.48
I'm the one that's kicking in the door and where my team is doing that.

1300
01:11:06.48 --> 01:11:12.12
So I need to take ownership of what we're doing and make sure that this is the right thing

1301
01:11:12.12 --> 01:11:14.36
to do in the right situation.

1302
01:11:14.36 --> 01:11:22.16
Because yeah, I mean, so if you're allowed to sort of push responsibility onto 14 different

1303
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:26.04
people that all had a hand in the intel gathering, which a bunch of people do gather that

1304
01:11:26.04 --> 01:11:31.08
intel, but who's pulling the trigger, who's saying, yes, go and you need to own that.

1305
01:11:31.08 --> 01:11:35.000
If you make that mistake and explain why, and then you can put some procedures in place

1306
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.40
that won't let it happen again.

1307
01:11:38.40 --> 01:11:41.32
And also, you have to question a little bit.

1308
01:11:41.32 --> 01:11:44.96
You have the Inspector General of the Air Force investigating the Air Force.

1309
01:11:44.96 --> 01:11:49.48
Like, you know, would it be better to have an independent person looking at this as opposed

1310
01:11:49.48 --> 01:11:52.08
to having somebody investigate themselves?

1311
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:53.08
I don't know.

1312
01:11:53.08 --> 01:11:56.88
But it's just a sort of a question that I've asked myself.

1313
01:11:56.88 --> 01:11:59.28
And there's another thing that can happen as well.

1314
01:11:59.28 --> 01:12:05.88
And this was a term that I first heard when I was in Iraq, my second deployment, good

1315
01:12:05.88 --> 01:12:08.16
shot bad result.

1316
01:12:08.16 --> 01:12:13.92
Meaning when you lay out what happened, what a individual saw, like if the person that pulled

1317
01:12:13.92 --> 01:12:19.60
the trigger, what he saw, what he understood, what he was thinking, you lay all those things

1318
01:12:19.60 --> 01:12:21.08
out.

1319
01:12:21.08 --> 01:12:24.44
You say, you know what, that was a good shot.

1320
01:12:24.44 --> 01:12:26.36
I understand why you took that shot.

1321
01:12:26.36 --> 01:12:28.92
I'm sorry that this is what happened.

1322
01:12:28.92 --> 01:12:34.80
But we at least investigate and say, okay, how did this happen?

1323
01:12:34.80 --> 01:12:36.52
How did this occur?

1324
01:12:36.52 --> 01:12:40.48
And how do we make sure that first of all, the person wasn't being negligent, the person's

1325
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:42.52
not trying to hide anything?

1326
01:12:42.52 --> 01:12:46.16
Because look, when you're in war, you're going to shoot people.

1327
01:12:46.16 --> 01:12:50.08
And occasionally, you're going to shoot someone that didn't deserve to get shot.

1328
01:12:50.08 --> 01:12:51.24
What happens?

1329
01:12:51.24 --> 01:12:56.08
And when that happens, you have to actually look at it and say, okay, how did it happen?

1330
01:12:56.08 --> 01:12:57.76
How did you make that decision?

1331
01:12:57.76 --> 01:12:58.92
Why did you make that decision?

1332
01:12:58.92 --> 01:12:59.92
What did you see?

1333
01:12:59.92 --> 01:13:01.92
You pull all that stuff apart.

1334
01:13:01.92 --> 01:13:09.80
And with my guys, the couple times that something like this happened, it was, hey, I understand

1335
01:13:09.80 --> 01:13:11.20
why you took that shot.

1336
01:13:11.20 --> 01:13:14.56
And it was actually the right call.

1337
01:13:14.56 --> 01:13:18.44
And it's horrible that has a bad result.

1338
01:13:18.44 --> 01:13:21.64
But I understand why you did it and it made sense.

1339
01:13:21.64 --> 01:13:26.32
You know, that's a lot different than, oh, wait a second, you didn't see anything that

1340
01:13:26.32 --> 01:13:29.48
looks suspicious or you, why did you shoot this while?

1341
01:13:29.48 --> 01:13:30.48
I don't know.

1342
01:13:30.48 --> 01:13:31.84
Never got that answer.

1343
01:13:31.84 --> 01:13:33.32
And never was in those situations.

1344
01:13:33.32 --> 01:13:39.20
So for, for, to your point, for, to pull the thread on the whole thing, if someone said,

1345
01:13:39.20 --> 01:13:40.40
hey, this is what we saw.

1346
01:13:40.40 --> 01:13:41.88
This is the vehicle that we were targeting.

1347
01:13:41.88 --> 01:13:43.44
This is the intel hit that we got.

1348
01:13:43.44 --> 01:13:44.84
This is what our informant said.

1349
01:13:44.84 --> 01:13:47.32
This is what our electronics surveillance said.

1350
01:13:47.32 --> 01:13:52.72
They could actually paint a picture where you say, you know, in that pressure situation,

1351
01:13:52.72 --> 01:13:54.48
I understand what you did.

1352
01:13:54.48 --> 01:13:58.12
I understand why you took that shot and you took the risk at taking that shot.

1353
01:13:58.12 --> 01:14:00.68
So you could save Americans and save an attack.

1354
01:14:00.68 --> 01:14:02.52
I understand that.

1355
01:14:02.52 --> 01:14:05.48
Okay, now we, we at least learned something.

1356
01:14:05.48 --> 01:14:11.44
But to just say, nothing, it doesn't make sense.

1357
01:14:11.44 --> 01:14:13.40
It's not, it's not the right move, man.

1358
01:14:13.40 --> 01:14:17.56
It's not the right move, it's not the right move.

1359
01:14:17.56 --> 01:14:23.80
You also, I mean, you were like on the freaking Taliban tourist trip.

1360
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:29.60
I mean, you went to visit Mola Almars, like remote mosque out there.

1361
01:14:29.60 --> 01:14:30.60
What was happening?

1362
01:14:30.60 --> 01:14:34.84
So we took this, you know, again, taking advantage of the fact suddenly, we went to,

1363
01:14:34.84 --> 01:14:38.28
I went to almost all the provinces because this was something that I couldn't have

1364
01:14:38.28 --> 01:14:40.44
a deeper flow by raging.

1365
01:14:40.44 --> 01:14:43.84
Only we could, we could travel and this was fascinating to me.

1366
01:14:43.84 --> 01:14:50.28
So we took this epic kind of journey from Kabul to Kandahar and, you know, through

1367
01:14:50.28 --> 01:14:56.60
Loga and then Wardak and then through Gazi and actually was very bizarre and Gazi, we

1368
01:14:56.60 --> 01:14:58.16
say the filthyest hotel.

1369
01:14:58.16 --> 01:15:00.44
I think I've ever stayed out of my life.

1370
01:15:00.44 --> 01:15:03.000
I think the sheets weren't like it was, it was gross.

1371
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.44
And my dearest was still September or it was very hot.

1372
01:15:05.44 --> 01:15:07.68
It was a bad yelp review for sure.

1373
01:15:07.68 --> 01:15:08.68
It was not hard just that.

1374
01:15:08.68 --> 01:15:10.56
I didn't have a sleep, the toilet didn't work.

1375
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:14.80
Like there was just one shared squat toilet that didn't work and the shower didn't work

1376
01:15:14.80 --> 01:15:18.36
and it was over flooding when I just, I just kind of wait to leave that place.

1377
01:15:18.36 --> 01:15:19.84
But anyhow, what's so bizarre?

1378
01:15:19.84 --> 01:15:24.72
I like the fact that you're jumping in a random car, the Taliban elders, but you

1379
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:27.72
don't get mad into a lot of freaking stuff, upshallower.

1380
01:15:27.72 --> 01:15:29.000
But you know what's so bizarre?

1381
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.56
So we're sitting there and there's little place having dinner downstairs and again,

1382
01:15:32.56 --> 01:15:35.24
it's very unusual for a woman to be out in nine hours.

1383
01:15:35.24 --> 01:15:37.48
I go, you know, effort, I'm going out.

1384
01:15:37.48 --> 01:15:38.68
So I'm having dinner with you.

1385
01:15:38.68 --> 01:15:43.000
It was my driver, my fixer and my photographer.

1386
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.56
And then a bunch of Kanda Hari telebands come into the restaurant and sort of sitting there

1387
01:15:47.56 --> 01:15:52.84
and, and, you're staring and doing there, you know, asking a few questions and went

1388
01:15:52.84 --> 01:15:53.84
about their business.

1389
01:15:53.84 --> 01:15:58.04
But anyway, I found out the next day which was very strange to the hotel.

1390
01:15:58.04 --> 01:15:59.92
And because I have to stay separately to the man.

1391
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:03.84
So the guys all shared one room and then as a woman, I have to have my own room.

1392
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:08.72
So I was on the other side and then these Kanda Hari telebands, so bizarre.

1393
01:16:08.72 --> 01:16:09.72
They stayed.

1394
01:16:09.72 --> 01:16:12.72
They were traveling through but they stayed that night because they heard their

1395
01:16:12.72 --> 01:16:14.08
affarn is there.

1396
01:16:14.08 --> 01:16:19.60
And literally they stayed outside my room that night to make sure nobody came in, which

1397
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:20.60
was just bizarre.

1398
01:16:20.60 --> 01:16:25.16
Anyway, it kind of goes back to their past June, Wally, hospitality, wanting to make

1399
01:16:25.16 --> 01:16:28.64
sure nothing happened to the affarn is.

1400
01:16:28.64 --> 01:16:33.80
Which, yeah, we can talk about that because that leads to so many different things.

1401
01:16:33.80 --> 01:16:40.20
But that sort of shows you this very bizarre, decodemy of what is happening in this country.

1402
01:16:40.20 --> 01:16:44.48
Because on one hand, you're sort of seeing acts like that and then on the other hand, you

1403
01:16:44.48 --> 01:16:48.80
see the brutality and you see this insurgency that's trying to be a government.

1404
01:16:48.80 --> 01:16:50.20
So, yeah, very bizarre.

1405
01:16:50.20 --> 01:16:54.68
But anyway, we continue to go through the Kanda Hari, which is the birthplace of the

1406
01:16:54.68 --> 01:16:55.68
telebands.

1407
01:16:55.68 --> 01:16:59.28
On all the roads they bombed up, you know, I'd ask them, who bombed this road?

1408
01:16:59.28 --> 01:17:00.28
Oh, we did.

1409
01:17:00.28 --> 01:17:05.16
We've got to fix it, right? Like, now it's time because the road's a terrible.

1410
01:17:05.16 --> 01:17:07.88
So, you know, we eventually got there.

1411
01:17:07.88 --> 01:17:13.72
And then it's about two hours from Kanda Hari City to go to this little tiny, it's

1412
01:17:13.72 --> 01:17:18.80
in Sangha's art, which is where Molo must started the teleband in 1994.

1413
01:17:18.80 --> 01:17:24.16
So, we drive there and get to this, it's extremely primitive place.

1414
01:17:24.16 --> 01:17:25.36
It's just mud hard.

1415
01:17:25.36 --> 01:17:28.28
It's dirt roads.

1416
01:17:28.28 --> 01:17:32.08
And somewhere I really think that the US just never was because it was just, it was

1417
01:17:32.08 --> 01:17:33.64
Taliban territory forever.

1418
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:42.88
So, we get there and just this one tiny square room in the middle of nowhere.

1419
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:48.04
And go in and the Imam and these village elders welcome us in.

1420
01:17:48.04 --> 01:17:52.88
And it was actually strange again because that was the first time that, and it was at Molo

1421
01:17:52.88 --> 01:17:58.32
Imam's mosque that the Molo's were actually looking at me and talking to me.

1422
01:17:58.32 --> 01:18:02.44
I felt this is just strange because I've come from all these other places and here should

1423
01:18:02.44 --> 01:18:04.76
be the most conservative of all.

1424
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:08.88
And yet you're actually engaging and asking, asking me about my personal life.

1425
01:18:08.88 --> 01:18:12.28
You know, so I just thought this is bizarre.

1426
01:18:12.28 --> 01:18:17.80
But, you know, they're sort of philosophy on it was that Molo and my gained traction

1427
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:22.64
and gained supporters because this came after the, there was a civil war going on.

1428
01:18:22.64 --> 01:18:28.52
So after the Russians were kicked out of Afghanistan, you know, quickly things became

1429
01:18:28.52 --> 01:18:33.36
another war again, which was the civil war in Afghanistan and Molo and my presented this

1430
01:18:33.36 --> 01:18:38.56
idea of there was going to be no corruption and the crime was going to stop and he would

1431
01:18:38.56 --> 01:18:43.44
give food and money and things to the poor and, and people gravitated to that and you

1432
01:18:43.44 --> 01:18:48.64
could see just from sort of the simplicity of this tiny little mosque that, you know, looked

1433
01:18:48.64 --> 01:18:53.44
like the comp, it's weren't replaced in 30, 40 years that that was really something I

1434
01:18:53.44 --> 01:18:58.08
think that he did live by was this sort of sense of humility and I think a lot of

1435
01:18:58.08 --> 01:19:02.68
Afghans at that point when they were starting to see corruption among all these warlords,

1436
01:19:02.68 --> 01:19:07.68
they gravitated to that and that's how he was able to build a very strong following very

1437
01:19:07.68 --> 01:19:09.96
quickly.

1438
01:19:09.96 --> 01:19:15.40
You mentioned to me about seeing people addicted to drugs there.

1439
01:19:15.40 --> 01:19:20.16
And what's that culture like because it's the Mecca for Opium, right?

1440
01:19:20.16 --> 01:19:21.16
Yeah, absolutely.

1441
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:26.44
I think it's something more than 90% of the world's heroin and Opium come from Afghanistan.

1442
01:19:26.44 --> 01:19:31.08
So the Taliban has really brought that, that has been one of the number one ways they were

1443
01:19:31.08 --> 01:19:36.64
able to make money through the insurgency, was through the this allying of those drugs.

1444
01:19:36.64 --> 01:19:42.28
And they, a lot of the hell made, we went up to Hellman to sangin and places like that

1445
01:19:42.28 --> 01:19:45.32
where they grew the pop bees and it's funny because I went,

1446
01:19:45.32 --> 01:19:48.72
the Taliban were putting on this big, you know, despite we're getting rid of the drugs,

1447
01:19:48.72 --> 01:19:54.72
it's a rum, we're going to kill the crops and blah, blah, blah, and I was at the

1448
01:19:54.72 --> 01:19:59.84
Canada and I caught it and the guys, you know, they're putting on this display but then

1449
01:19:59.84 --> 01:20:04.04
it became very evident to me, especially when I went there and the Taliban themselves

1450
01:20:04.04 --> 01:20:08.96
are harvesting it and I said, well, so you tell me it's a rum and then one of them says

1451
01:20:08.96 --> 01:20:11.36
to me it's only her arm if we sell it to Afghans.

1452
01:20:11.36 --> 01:20:13.40
If we sell it over the border, it's not her arm.

1453
01:20:13.40 --> 01:20:18.88
So basically they said, we can sell it to, we can kill other people in other places but

1454
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:22.48
we don't want to kill, we don't want to kill Afghans.

1455
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:24.08
So that was sort of there for us.

1456
01:20:24.08 --> 01:20:26.28
I don't see them ending that anytime soon.

1457
01:20:26.28 --> 01:20:32.52
They're going to try to, I think, probably find avenues to legalize it in the sense of

1458
01:20:32.52 --> 01:20:38.52
countries that perhaps are friendly to them that need OPM for medicine.

1459
01:20:38.52 --> 01:20:41.52
I think that's their approach that they seem like they're going to want to take is

1460
01:20:41.52 --> 01:20:44.12
to try to legalize it in some way.

1461
01:20:44.12 --> 01:20:48.52
Now they were using the jails to, they were, rounding up a lot of the addicts from the streets

1462
01:20:48.52 --> 01:20:53.12
and there's a lot of addicts in the streets and rounding them up and putting them in jail

1463
01:20:53.12 --> 01:20:55.24
because they didn't have proper rehab.

1464
01:20:55.24 --> 01:20:59.40
So that was sort of the approach that the Taliban's have been taking.

1465
01:20:59.40 --> 01:21:00.40
Thank you.

1466
01:21:00.40 --> 01:21:04.56
Those two, they have a lot of, sadly, a lot of young kids.

1467
01:21:04.56 --> 01:21:09.44
Is there a drug culture of some kind or is it just something that sort of seeps into, hey,

1468
01:21:09.44 --> 01:21:12.96
this is what we grow, you start trying it, you start figuring it out, whatever.

1469
01:21:12.96 --> 01:21:17.52
You know, it was like one little boy that I talked to, he was 13 and he was addicted and

1470
01:21:17.52 --> 01:21:20.52
he was in this jail and I said, well, how did you start taking this?

1471
01:21:20.52 --> 01:21:24.000
And he said, several years ago, he'd have to go and buy it for his dad.

1472
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.24
So he'd go and buy, get the, get the, you know, puppies and heroin for his dad and then

1473
01:21:29.24 --> 01:21:33.16
eventually he just, you know, tried at once and he'd be chemiticked.

1474
01:21:33.16 --> 01:21:39.36
So I think it tends to filter through families and really impoverished families usually.

1475
01:21:39.36 --> 01:21:41.04
So yeah, just.

1476
01:21:41.04 --> 01:21:47.40
No, you eventually do get like detained and kind of accuse the being a spider.

1477
01:21:47.40 --> 01:21:48.40
What happened with that?

1478
01:21:48.40 --> 01:21:49.40
Oh, gosh.

1479
01:21:49.40 --> 01:21:50.40
So that was also in Canada, huh?

1480
01:21:50.40 --> 01:21:53.24
So what happens is as a journalist.

1481
01:21:53.24 --> 01:21:54.88
So just to go back a little bit.

1482
01:21:54.88 --> 01:21:59.32
So when you get to the country, as a journalist, you have to go to the, the minister of

1483
01:21:59.32 --> 01:22:02.80
information and culture, which is sort of like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

1484
01:22:02.80 --> 01:22:06.52
And they check your credentials and give you a, a major hit.

1485
01:22:06.52 --> 01:22:10.44
That would be all the major hit is the spokesperson basically gives you a signed letter that

1486
01:22:10.44 --> 01:22:14.92
says you're credited journalists to be able to work and, and you flash that letter.

1487
01:22:14.92 --> 01:22:18.76
So when I'm going through a checkpoint or when I'm going to try to interview, I flashed

1488
01:22:18.76 --> 01:22:22.28
my Zabby all the letter and they say, okay, she's practically coming in or whatever the

1489
01:22:22.28 --> 01:22:23.12
situation is.

1490
01:22:23.12 --> 01:22:28.12
So, and when you go to a province, you have to, the protocol is you're supposed to go

1491
01:22:28.12 --> 01:22:32.76
and inform the minister of information and culture that you are there so that they know

1492
01:22:32.76 --> 01:22:35.60
that you can get through checkpoints and you're not going to get arrested.

1493
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:38.36
So in Canada, how that's exactly what we did.

1494
01:22:38.36 --> 01:22:42.66
We went to the Ministry of Information and Culture and did an interview with him about blah,

1495
01:22:42.66 --> 01:22:45.92
blah, blah, and he said, okay, you can go anyway.

1496
01:22:45.92 --> 01:22:47.76
You want goodbye sort of thing.

1497
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:51.68
So we're like, okay, well, we're going to spend boldack, which is the border of Pakistan

1498
01:22:51.68 --> 01:22:53.32
and in Canada.

1499
01:22:53.32 --> 01:22:58.08
So it leads into into that tribal area.

1500
01:22:58.08 --> 01:22:59.48
So into Quadar.

1501
01:22:59.48 --> 01:23:04.32
So we go down to spend boldack and there's just people everywhere trying because the border

1502
01:23:04.32 --> 01:23:08.96
is mostly closed and there's people everywhere and instantly I just get mobbed.

1503
01:23:08.96 --> 01:23:16.24
Like absolutely, I'm talking just fluttered by hundreds of people that just surround me.

1504
01:23:16.24 --> 01:23:20.16
You know, with my fixer, I'm like, don't leave me because these people are going to mob

1505
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:21.16
me.

1506
01:23:21.16 --> 01:23:23.16
So I'm trying to do an interview just you just get mobbed.

1507
01:23:23.16 --> 01:23:28.40
It was crazy and the talent just cuts your western school.

1508
01:23:28.40 --> 01:23:33.44
Yeah, they saw a camera and they saw a female and they thought, okay, John, everybody

1509
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:35.60
makes a curious, I want to tell this story.

1510
01:23:35.60 --> 01:23:40.64
But what was bizarre, Jokal is the telebands before being like whipping these guys to get them

1511
01:23:40.64 --> 01:23:42.60
away from me and I was like, please stop that.

1512
01:23:42.60 --> 01:23:44.60
Like, I don't want to be responsible.

1513
01:23:44.60 --> 01:23:50.36
They just continue just to follow.

1514
01:23:50.36 --> 01:23:54.32
I was like, you're just getting whipped and I was upset about it because I didn't want

1515
01:23:54.32 --> 01:23:56.000
people getting hurt.

1516
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.68
Oh, just why are you not leaving when this is happening?

1517
01:24:00.68 --> 01:24:01.68
It was bizarre.

1518
01:24:01.68 --> 01:24:05.16
What ended up happening was it just it got to the point where it was so much.

1519
01:24:05.16 --> 01:24:09.24
There were just just people everywhere and just what was the closing in on me.

1520
01:24:09.24 --> 01:24:10.48
This town was like, what?

1521
01:24:10.48 --> 01:24:11.76
Who, what kind of town was this?

1522
01:24:11.76 --> 01:24:12.76
It was like a super remote town.

1523
01:24:12.76 --> 01:24:13.76
It's a border town.

1524
01:24:13.76 --> 01:24:15.76
It's just a border crossing.

1525
01:24:15.76 --> 01:24:18.48
So it was a small bit just so many people.

1526
01:24:18.48 --> 01:24:20.36
But they were just freaking hyped to see you.

1527
01:24:20.36 --> 01:24:25.04
Just it was the craziest thing and I, I mean, you have that a little bit, but this was

1528
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:28.44
a whole other level where I just thought, oh my goodness, what is happening?

1529
01:24:28.44 --> 01:24:32.52
Anyway, I couldn't go anywhere and I would try to grab people to interview them into a store

1530
01:24:32.52 --> 01:24:36.60
and I'd look at the window and suddenly the store was just surrounded.

1531
01:24:36.60 --> 01:24:37.84
It was so crazy.

1532
01:24:37.84 --> 01:24:42.64
And I said, I just, I didn't, and the, and the, so the telebans were coming along, asking

1533
01:24:42.64 --> 01:24:44.60
questions, what is happening.

1534
01:24:44.60 --> 01:24:46.60
And we tried to call the driver.

1535
01:24:46.60 --> 01:24:48.72
And we have this funny driver called Shafiq.

1536
01:24:48.72 --> 01:24:53.52
And he, he always likes to eat.

1537
01:24:53.52 --> 01:24:56.44
And every time he goes, he just finds eat.

1538
01:24:56.44 --> 01:24:59.96
And suddenly Shafiq's not in the place that he, we'd love to.

1539
01:24:59.96 --> 01:25:01.60
Shafiq had gone off to get food.

1540
01:25:01.60 --> 01:25:02.60
At the corner.

1541
01:25:02.60 --> 01:25:04.20
And the car wasn't there.

1542
01:25:04.20 --> 01:25:07.24
And, and, and, and the weed, my fixer is calling Shafiq.

1543
01:25:07.24 --> 01:25:08.68
I mean, where are you?

1544
01:25:08.68 --> 01:25:09.68
Where are he?

1545
01:25:09.68 --> 01:25:10.92
He's not answering his phone.

1546
01:25:10.92 --> 01:25:13.44
And so the telebans come along in their police vehicle.

1547
01:25:13.44 --> 01:25:16.68
And we're just trying to call Shafiq and I'm telling them, like, we're leaving, we're

1548
01:25:16.68 --> 01:25:17.68
leaving.

1549
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:18.88
We're just getting our driver.

1550
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:20.76
We couldn't contact the driver.

1551
01:25:20.76 --> 01:25:23.20
And so next thing, you know, telebans like, are I get in?

1552
01:25:23.20 --> 01:25:24.96
And I said, I don't want to get in your car.

1553
01:25:24.96 --> 01:25:26.36
I want to go to the police station.

1554
01:25:26.36 --> 01:25:28.20
And they said, no, get in.

1555
01:25:28.20 --> 01:25:31.68
And so we get into the police vehicle.

1556
01:25:31.68 --> 01:25:33.24
We go to the police station.

1557
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:35.76
And they put us in their detention room.

1558
01:25:35.76 --> 01:25:37.16
And we're sitting there for a while.

1559
01:25:37.16 --> 01:25:39.36
And I'm thinking, this is going to get resolved really quickly.

1560
01:25:39.36 --> 01:25:40.36
Now, as an hour, as an hour.

1561
01:25:40.36 --> 01:25:42.76
And then finally, just more of them are piling in.

1562
01:25:42.76 --> 01:25:44.64
And the top intel guy is piling in.

1563
01:25:44.64 --> 01:25:46.92
And all these telebans are piling in.

1564
01:25:46.92 --> 01:25:48.24
And I'm showing them my credentials.

1565
01:25:48.24 --> 01:25:49.24
I'm showing them the letter.

1566
01:25:49.24 --> 01:25:50.52
I'm showing them the passport.

1567
01:25:50.52 --> 01:25:51.52
I'm showing them my press card.

1568
01:25:51.52 --> 01:25:53.56
And they said, oh, this is fake.

1569
01:25:53.56 --> 01:25:55.56
That's not.

1570
01:25:55.56 --> 01:25:58.40
They said, yes, it is.

1571
01:25:58.40 --> 01:26:01.84
And they're accusing us of basically spying.

1572
01:26:01.84 --> 01:26:05.56
And I just, I don't know what else to tell you.

1573
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:06.56
I'm a journalist.

1574
01:26:06.56 --> 01:26:07.56
I've showed you my credentials.

1575
01:26:07.56 --> 01:26:09.04
I've showed you my passport.

1576
01:26:09.04 --> 01:26:11.000
You have all my information.

1577
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.60
So I don't know what to tell you.

1578
01:26:12.60 --> 01:26:14.52
So we're sort of sitting there.

1579
01:26:14.52 --> 01:26:15.80
More people are coming in.

1580
01:26:15.80 --> 01:26:16.80
Hammering us.

1581
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:18.20
I can see my fixer starting to get wide.

1582
01:26:18.20 --> 01:26:20.72
And he's a very sort of cool com.

1583
01:26:20.72 --> 01:26:23.16
He doesn't really things don't rattle him too much.

1584
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:28.56
But I can see he's starting to get wide and doesn't know what to do.

1585
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:31.84
And they're telling, you know, it's about these packastany spies that they arrested a couple

1586
01:26:31.84 --> 01:26:33.20
of nights earlier.

1587
01:26:33.20 --> 01:26:39.04
And long story short, eventually, many hours later, they were able to get in contact with

1588
01:26:39.04 --> 01:26:43.52
the, there's Abigail's office who was able to verify our information.

1589
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:45.04
And then they were extremely apologetic.

1590
01:26:45.04 --> 01:26:46.84
And they said, well, we'll take you to the border.

1591
01:26:46.84 --> 01:26:49.08
And you can, you know, photograph the packastany's.

1592
01:26:49.08 --> 01:26:51.68
At that point, they were fighting with the packastanies.

1593
01:26:51.68 --> 01:26:58.32
So yeah, I guess that was so, so we ended up going to the border and getting, you know,

1594
01:26:58.32 --> 01:27:02.76
some good interviews and footage in there were very, very apologetic about the situation.

1595
01:27:02.76 --> 01:27:08.20
But it was just one of those, those situations where that, that usually is the case for journalists

1596
01:27:08.20 --> 01:27:13.28
is that especially working in the Middle East or in Asia like Afghanistan, they will accuse

1597
01:27:13.28 --> 01:27:14.28
you of being spies.

1598
01:27:14.28 --> 01:27:18.76
And you have a little recourse to argue and say, well, I've showed you my credentials.

1599
01:27:18.76 --> 01:27:21.36
I'm not, but I don't know what I need to do.

1600
01:27:21.36 --> 01:27:22.36
Convinciu anymore.

1601
01:27:22.36 --> 01:27:29.08
You've got like survivors bias, but you just, we just make it through everything.

1602
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:30.08
It's crazy.

1603
01:27:30.08 --> 01:27:35.32
Like there's so many people that this, your story always seems to end up working out.

1604
01:27:35.32 --> 01:27:38.48
Yeah, because, yeah, it's a touch on touch.

1605
01:27:38.48 --> 01:27:39.48
What on that one?

1606
01:27:39.48 --> 01:27:42.72
What about the Hakkana, you visited coasts kind of?

1607
01:27:42.72 --> 01:27:43.96
So, host, yeah.

1608
01:27:43.96 --> 01:27:48.72
So that was, that sort of way the Hakkana is a lot of them come from that in Pactia.

1609
01:27:48.72 --> 01:27:50.60
And yes, so that was interesting.

1610
01:27:50.60 --> 01:27:54.40
So I have a good friend of mine who's from host and so we went down there.

1611
01:27:54.40 --> 01:27:58.20
And you know, it was an interesting place because it, you know, again, is that sort of

1612
01:27:58.20 --> 01:28:02.84
the home of the Hakkana is, but it was very untouched a lot of the time by actual conflict.

1613
01:28:02.84 --> 01:28:08.32
It was one of the few places where you had roads that were decent and that it was a very

1614
01:28:08.32 --> 01:28:10.36
self-sufficient kind of place.

1615
01:28:10.36 --> 01:28:16.28
But yeah, what struck me going in is this big billboard of Bobo Bell.

1616
01:28:16.28 --> 01:28:19.28
That's just there.

1617
01:28:19.28 --> 01:28:22.76
You enter, as you enter the city.

1618
01:28:22.76 --> 01:28:24.84
And it's Bobo Bell and another moora.

1619
01:28:24.84 --> 01:28:26.48
Like a salute to Bobo Bell.

1620
01:28:26.48 --> 01:28:27.48
Well, no, it's not.

1621
01:28:27.48 --> 01:28:31.64
It's him looking down and like he sort of got blood on his face and he's looking, like

1622
01:28:31.64 --> 01:28:35.52
he's detained and miserable and then there's this moora standing in the picture next

1623
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:36.52
to him.

1624
01:28:36.52 --> 01:28:39.52
And it's a poem in Pactia that doesn't really make a lot of sense.

1625
01:28:39.52 --> 01:28:42.36
But it's basically a tribute to this moora and I'm still very, I'm clear.

1626
01:28:42.36 --> 01:28:44.72
I thought your saying was a tribute to Bobo Bell.

1627
01:28:44.72 --> 01:28:46.000
Oh, it's almost sort of a, it's almost like a, it's almost like a, it's almost

1628
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.24
sort of like a, it's a tribute to the moora, but for some reason they felt the need

1629
01:28:51.24 --> 01:28:52.48
to put the Bobo Bell there.

1630
01:28:52.48 --> 01:28:57.04
It's this new new billboard and then I found out that the, the, the, the, the, the

1631
01:28:57.04 --> 01:29:00.48
governor of host is actually one of the, get my five.

1632
01:29:00.48 --> 01:29:05.84
So I guess he put it up there to celebrate himself in some way and he actually

1633
01:29:05.84 --> 01:29:10.44
invited us to go and do an interview which I didn't end up going because he didn't

1634
01:29:10.44 --> 01:29:14.68
want, I went and met with the mayor, but I didn't go and meet with him because my,

1635
01:29:14.68 --> 01:29:18.56
he didn't want my friend, the friend that had the hosty friend who would take in me

1636
01:29:18.56 --> 01:29:19.56
to host.

1637
01:29:19.56 --> 01:29:20.60
He didn't want her to go.

1638
01:29:20.60 --> 01:29:22.80
So I felt sort of a blind to do.

1639
01:29:22.80 --> 01:29:25.24
I mean, just explain that Taliban five point.

1640
01:29:25.24 --> 01:29:26.24
Yeah.

1641
01:29:26.24 --> 01:29:27.24
Yeah.

1642
01:29:27.24 --> 01:29:33.76
So I guess when when Bobo Bell was traded, he was, what, captured in 2009, he ran off base, I

1643
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:34.76
think.

1644
01:29:34.76 --> 01:29:39.92
He deserted his base in, in the neighboring Pactia, which is next to host.

1645
01:29:39.92 --> 01:29:44.000
And he was captured by the Taliban and the, ultimately, the Hakanis took him.

1646
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.88
And he was, I guess, yeah, and a captivity for a long time.

1647
01:29:46.88 --> 01:29:52.28
And then eventually under the Obama administration, I think it was in 2015, they orchestrated

1648
01:29:52.28 --> 01:30:00.08
a deal to release five, get my detainees in exchange for the one US soldier.

1649
01:30:00.08 --> 01:30:01.08
So.

1650
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:05.24
And now now that one of the guys is, what the mayor, what is he?

1651
01:30:05.24 --> 01:30:06.24
He's the governor.

1652
01:30:06.24 --> 01:30:07.24
The governor.

1653
01:30:07.24 --> 01:30:08.24
The governor of host now.

1654
01:30:08.24 --> 01:30:09.24
Yeah.

1655
01:30:09.24 --> 01:30:11.72
They're only in top leadership positions.

1656
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:13.12
They're all running the show.

1657
01:30:13.12 --> 01:30:14.80
And that Connie's themselves.

1658
01:30:14.80 --> 01:30:18.40
I mean, Suraj, he's wanted by the US for $5 million.

1659
01:30:18.40 --> 01:30:20.64
He's now the Minister of Interior.

1660
01:30:20.64 --> 01:30:27.04
And he's Uncle Khalil is the Minister of Refugees, which, yeah, I don't know, I don't

1661
01:30:27.04 --> 01:30:28.24
know what that entails.

1662
01:30:28.24 --> 01:30:30.36
It's crazy.

1663
01:30:30.36 --> 01:30:33.72
So how about the, let's talk a little bit about this.

1664
01:30:33.72 --> 01:30:38.52
So, you know, you mentioned the Hakani, you got Taliban, a Hakani, and Taliban are very

1665
01:30:38.52 --> 01:30:40.20
aligned, right?

1666
01:30:40.20 --> 01:30:44.52
Um, in fact, they, they kind of say there's no difference between the two, even others.

1667
01:30:44.52 --> 01:30:49.88
Well, the, the Hakanis are actually designated terrorist organization, but the Taliban isn't.

1668
01:30:49.88 --> 01:30:52.52
But I'm saying in Afghanistan, they're very close.

1669
01:30:52.52 --> 01:30:54.92
Well, now it's basically in twine.

1670
01:30:54.92 --> 01:30:55.92
Right.

1671
01:30:55.92 --> 01:30:58.48
I think before it was, there was slight sort of ideological differences.

1672
01:30:58.48 --> 01:31:02.72
And in many ways, the Hakanis were, they were the leading, they were like the whole

1673
01:31:02.72 --> 01:31:03.72
talks.

1674
01:31:03.72 --> 01:31:07.08
Yeah, they were the hardcore, most of the suicide bombings were orchestrated by them.

1675
01:31:07.08 --> 01:31:11.92
They were the ones kidnapping who still have Americans and kept, kept tivety.

1676
01:31:11.92 --> 01:31:17.36
But, um, and I mean, you know, you know, very close without, you know, the founder of the Hakanis,

1677
01:31:17.36 --> 01:31:18.36
Hakani himself.

1678
01:31:18.36 --> 01:31:19.36
Yeah.

1679
01:31:19.36 --> 01:31:23.000
This was a guy that was, you know, funded by the CIA to fight the Soviet Union, Reagan

1680
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.96
called him personally, a freedom fighter.

1681
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:25.96
Yes.

1682
01:31:25.96 --> 01:31:26.96
Yes.

1683
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:27.96
That's, that's bizarre.

1684
01:31:27.96 --> 01:31:29.52
So, when we talk about things, the B.M.

1685
01:31:29.52 --> 01:31:29.76
B.R.

1686
01:31:29.76 --> 01:31:32.72
Right now, they didn't bizarre for a long time.

1687
01:31:32.72 --> 01:31:34.28
They, they've been very bizarre for a long.

1688
01:31:34.28 --> 01:31:39.96
We paid him millions of dollars, um, the founder of the Hakani.

1689
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:46.44
And I think, I mean, it's an, it's a fascinating guy, you know, and he was, um, he's got

1690
01:31:46.44 --> 01:31:48.20
two wives, got seven sons.

1691
01:31:48.20 --> 01:31:51.68
I think three or four of his sons were killed in combat.

1692
01:31:51.68 --> 01:31:52.68
Yeah.

1693
01:31:52.68 --> 01:31:55.28
And he, he's the really of the one who brought a lot of the Arabs into the fold.

1694
01:31:55.28 --> 01:32:00.28
So until that point, it was very, you know, Afghan Pakistan, he started getting a lot

1695
01:32:00.28 --> 01:32:04.92
of the Arab funding, which brought in the bin Laden and a lot of that kind of funding.

1696
01:32:04.92 --> 01:32:08.52
But, um, but what, what I found to be really interesting and, and really researching the

1697
01:32:08.52 --> 01:32:14.68
economies is they're very educated and they, they get a lot of education, a lot of their, their

1698
01:32:14.68 --> 01:32:20.52
wives go to the Middle East, go to Saudi Arabia and get education, which is ironic given

1699
01:32:20.52 --> 01:32:23.52
that so many of the women under the Taliban are deprived of education.

1700
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:27.92
So it's sort of this economy, but everyone I know who's worked closely or knows the

1701
01:32:27.92 --> 01:32:31.56
economies well will always say they're 20 steps ahead of everyone else.

1702
01:32:31.56 --> 01:32:34.56
Like they are the brainchild, really, of the Taliban.

1703
01:32:34.56 --> 01:32:40.64
So they know what is going on down to a tea and surage does not get photographed.

1704
01:32:40.64 --> 01:32:43.88
There is not a photograph of surage that you can possibly find.

1705
01:32:43.88 --> 01:32:48.64
A grainy photograph of the FBI has, but it's very old and very unclear.

1706
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:50.80
He does not get photographed at all.

1707
01:32:50.80 --> 01:32:57.88
And he did an event once when I was there, which was celebrating suicide bombers.

1708
01:32:57.88 --> 01:33:03.08
At the Intercontinental Hotel, which of course, the Hacani's, you know, sent suicide bombers

1709
01:33:03.08 --> 01:33:05.36
to several years earlier, the whole thing is.

1710
01:33:05.36 --> 01:33:06.88
So when did you go to this thing?

1711
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:07.88
Was this on this?

1712
01:33:07.88 --> 01:33:11.32
I didn't go in, this was in, this was in late October they had.

1713
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:14.96
They were giving land and compensation money to families of suicide bombers, which we can

1714
01:33:14.96 --> 01:33:19.84
get into because they very much continuing this suicide bombing despite being a government.

1715
01:33:19.84 --> 01:33:25.000
But they, um, so he's doing this big event there, but in every photograph that was taken,

1716
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.96
it's him from the back or him from the side or he's face his blood.

1717
01:33:27.96 --> 01:33:33.60
And I said to, to one of my sources there who was, he works for him who's a Kabul Intel

1718
01:33:33.60 --> 01:33:36.68
Taliban guy and I said, well, you know, what is up with that?

1719
01:33:36.68 --> 01:33:40.52
And he says, surage will walk around the street every few days.

1720
01:33:40.52 --> 01:33:42.04
And nobody knows who he is.

1721
01:33:42.04 --> 01:33:45.64
So he will walk around the street to check, you know, what's happening at the checkpoint,

1722
01:33:45.64 --> 01:33:49.60
it's check what the Taliban's are doing and nobody knows who he is.

1723
01:33:49.60 --> 01:33:51.32
And he's going to keep it that way.

1724
01:33:51.32 --> 01:33:53.52
I'm to cover balls and you know, such a lot.

1725
01:33:53.52 --> 01:33:56.12
But they're, yeah, they're it the whole thing is just crazy.

1726
01:33:56.12 --> 01:34:02.04
And then you have, so he's minister in interior and then you have Maloma son, Malaya

1727
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:04.04
Kube who's only about 2930.

1728
01:34:04.04 --> 01:34:09.36
He is the minister of defense and those two, about heads that unlike each other, they're

1729
01:34:09.36 --> 01:34:11.28
coming from different schools of thought.

1730
01:34:11.28 --> 01:34:16.08
So it's just, it's a crazy world.

1731
01:34:16.08 --> 01:34:19.36
And then outside of those two groups, you have ISIS K.

1732
01:34:19.36 --> 01:34:20.36
Yes.

1733
01:34:20.36 --> 01:34:21.36
Yes.

1734
01:34:21.36 --> 01:34:26.000
They, you know, they've had a presence in Afghanistan since about 2015.

1735
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.48
But essentially, we're pretty much defeated around 20, I think the Afghan government in

1736
01:34:30.48 --> 01:34:33.60
early 2019 basically said that they were defeated.

1737
01:34:33.60 --> 01:34:38.60
And that was the whole idea of the US's mission up until, I guess, Trump authorized them

1738
01:34:38.60 --> 01:34:39.88
to go after the Taliban's.

1739
01:34:39.88 --> 01:34:44.12
But up until then it was al-Qaeda and then ISIS.

1740
01:34:44.12 --> 01:34:47.48
And they've really made it, terrifying resurgence.

1741
01:34:47.48 --> 01:34:53.28
Because almost daily attacks happening across Afghanistan as I was there.

1742
01:34:53.28 --> 01:34:57.32
And they are like even more hardcore than the Hakani.

1743
01:34:57.32 --> 01:34:58.32
Is that accurate?

1744
01:34:58.32 --> 01:35:00.72
Yeah, they've got a different ideology.

1745
01:35:00.72 --> 01:35:08.28
So what makes the Taliban's and the Kani's different two ISIS and to al-Qaeda is they're

1746
01:35:08.28 --> 01:35:12.04
very, tell them it's a very much focused on Afghanistan.

1747
01:35:12.04 --> 01:35:13.80
They don't have any grandiose designs.

1748
01:35:13.80 --> 01:35:17.96
They say we want to make sure that no foreign is coming to our country.

1749
01:35:17.96 --> 01:35:21.52
We want good relations with everybody, but we don't want another foreign to come into

1750
01:35:21.52 --> 01:35:22.52
our country.

1751
01:35:22.52 --> 01:35:23.52
And they're like isolationists.

1752
01:35:23.52 --> 01:35:24.52
Yes.

1753
01:35:24.52 --> 01:35:30.08
They're very focused on Afghanistan, whereas groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda have a much

1754
01:35:30.08 --> 01:35:35.52
more global ideology, where they want to see, as the fighter said, they want to see

1755
01:35:35.52 --> 01:35:37.80
their interpretation spread throughout the world.

1756
01:35:37.80 --> 01:35:41.36
And they're the ones that will plan to tax in other countries.

1757
01:35:41.36 --> 01:35:46.88
So therefore, a view as a national security threat, whereas the Taliban isn't.

1758
01:35:46.88 --> 01:35:51.32
And that's really hard for the Afghans to, it's always been hard for the Afghans to really

1759
01:35:51.32 --> 01:35:56.56
wrap the head around because the Taliban's were doing so many suicide bombings and attacks.

1760
01:35:56.56 --> 01:35:58.12
And to them, they're absolutely terrorists.

1761
01:35:58.12 --> 01:36:04.08
And they couldn't, it was hard for me to explain to them why the US was sort of leaving

1762
01:36:04.08 --> 01:36:07.64
the Taliban's alone and going after these much smaller groups.

1763
01:36:07.64 --> 01:36:11.60
But we're at that point, not even doing that many attacks.

1764
01:36:11.60 --> 01:36:16.76
And that is going back to, well, the Taliban's is not a threat to United States necessarily

1765
01:36:16.76 --> 01:36:20.28
in and of itself.

1766
01:36:20.28 --> 01:36:27.28
You went to the area where the Taliban blew up the ancient Buddha's history.

1767
01:36:27.28 --> 01:36:32.28
Yes, the Bamiyan, Bamiyan, beautiful province, beautiful province.

1768
01:36:32.28 --> 01:36:35.12
Fifteen hundred years old, those statues were.

1769
01:36:35.12 --> 01:36:38.12
And that was crazy.

1770
01:36:38.12 --> 01:36:42.16
I talked to the Taliban about this about, was that a mistake.

1771
01:36:42.16 --> 01:36:45.48
And so they say, no, no, that wasn't a mistake.

1772
01:36:45.48 --> 01:36:48.84
That was the decision then, but now we're going to protect everything.

1773
01:36:48.84 --> 01:36:51.20
And so I went to a few other places with ruins.

1774
01:36:51.20 --> 01:36:52.64
And the Taliban's are all protecting it.

1775
01:36:52.64 --> 01:36:57.36
And I said, are we going to continue to protect these Buddhas or a Mzina, another place?

1776
01:36:57.36 --> 01:36:59.76
Yeah, yeah, that's our orders for now.

1777
01:36:59.76 --> 01:37:03.12
But what we have to remember is this might be their orders for now.

1778
01:37:03.12 --> 01:37:06.56
But they didn't blow up those Buddhas until early 2001.

1779
01:37:06.56 --> 01:37:10.80
So at that point, the Taliban's had already been in control of what since 1996.

1780
01:37:10.80 --> 01:37:13.72
So it was left alone.

1781
01:37:13.72 --> 01:37:18.36
And then Mullah Omar did it as an extortion because he wanted the international communities

1782
01:37:18.36 --> 01:37:21.80
to give the Taliban's money and the international community wouldn't.

1783
01:37:21.80 --> 01:37:25.92
So then he threatened, well, I'm going to blow up the Buddhas and still didn't get the

1784
01:37:25.92 --> 01:37:26.92
money.

1785
01:37:26.92 --> 01:37:28.16
So he made good and he's promised.

1786
01:37:28.16 --> 01:37:30.000
So that's the thing with the Taliban's right now.

1787
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.48
They might be okay where everything's okay, but you don't know what they're going to do

1788
01:37:33.48 --> 01:37:34.48
next month.

1789
01:37:34.48 --> 01:37:36.68
You don't know how the orders will change.

1790
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:40.36
And so and you get there and it was bizarre because the Taliban's are taking selfies

1791
01:37:40.36 --> 01:37:41.76
in front of these Blend Out Buddhas.

1792
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:47.40
And I said, well, you do know that you guys who blew these up, right?

1793
01:37:47.40 --> 01:37:49.60
It's just incredibly strange.

1794
01:37:49.60 --> 01:37:51.52
But Bermian is a beautiful province.

1795
01:37:51.52 --> 01:37:56.36
It shows you, I think when we think of Afghanistan, we just think of the war and the blood

1796
01:37:56.36 --> 01:38:04.72
shed, but it just is one of the most remarkably aesthetically beautiful places in the world.

1797
01:38:04.72 --> 01:38:07.52
And Bermian is just a prime example of that.

1798
01:38:07.52 --> 01:38:11.24
It was the first national park in Afghanistan.

1799
01:38:11.24 --> 01:38:15.96
Now there was a drone strike that killed the facilitator and planner.

1800
01:38:15.96 --> 01:38:18.92
And you did a little investigation on that as well.

1801
01:38:18.92 --> 01:38:23.36
Yes, so when there are a few times, so that was just outside Dallalabad in Nanganha.

1802
01:38:23.36 --> 01:38:26.64
So Nanganha has always been the hub for Icy's K.

1803
01:38:26.64 --> 01:38:28.68
It's on the Pakistan border on the east.

1804
01:38:28.68 --> 01:38:34.96
And it's just that is where, you know, Torabor is where bin Laden went and hid immediately.

1805
01:38:34.96 --> 01:38:40.96
I also went out to the Moab side, if you remember, when the US dropped that massive mother

1806
01:38:40.96 --> 01:38:42.72
of Obambs in beginning of 2017.

1807
01:38:42.72 --> 01:38:44.52
That's also in Nanganha.

1808
01:38:44.52 --> 01:38:51.68
So there's a couple of different areas, but that particular area was a district called Crockrod.

1809
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:53.88
And that was just outside of Dallalabad.

1810
01:38:53.88 --> 01:38:56.64
And it's one of those very eerie places.

1811
01:38:56.64 --> 01:39:01.64
And you go there and you feel like they're skinned and you're neck is standing up because

1812
01:39:01.64 --> 01:39:03.60
it just doesn't feel right.

1813
01:39:03.60 --> 01:39:06.76
And so the house that was hit was in the farm corner.

1814
01:39:06.76 --> 01:39:10.32
It was actually a really nice house compared to a lot of the mud huts and things.

1815
01:39:10.32 --> 01:39:12.44
And this was a nice sort of brick home.

1816
01:39:12.44 --> 01:39:14.88
And we went into the home.

1817
01:39:14.88 --> 01:39:16.24
And you could really see where it was hit.

1818
01:39:16.24 --> 01:39:17.68
And it was if it was so precise.

1819
01:39:17.68 --> 01:39:21.68
It was just like, you know, this one section of the backyard in this chair that had been

1820
01:39:21.68 --> 01:39:24.16
blown up and nothing else was touched.

1821
01:39:24.16 --> 01:39:27.08
So I went and talked to the neighbors there.

1822
01:39:27.08 --> 01:39:32.36
And one of the guys who was there as the drone strike hit, which was close to midnight,

1823
01:39:32.36 --> 01:39:36.36
he was on the guy gets guard duty on a roof across.

1824
01:39:36.36 --> 01:39:40.96
And yeah, he sort of said that there was a strange guy that sort of hadn't been living

1825
01:39:40.96 --> 01:39:42.40
there that long.

1826
01:39:42.40 --> 01:39:45.20
But would come and go.

1827
01:39:45.20 --> 01:39:49.88
And yeah, they hit that night and then sort of immediately I guess a car came and took

1828
01:39:49.88 --> 01:39:52.72
the women out of the house and the children.

1829
01:39:52.72 --> 01:39:57.64
And then the next day a bunch of televands came in and were taking things out, taking

1830
01:39:57.64 --> 01:40:00.40
flags, taking, he said, he didn't know what they were taking.

1831
01:40:00.40 --> 01:40:02.72
But big boxes that were just weighing the car down.

1832
01:40:02.72 --> 01:40:06.84
And then televands went in there after that and took out more things.

1833
01:40:06.84 --> 01:40:08.24
So I guess from the house.

1834
01:40:08.24 --> 01:40:13.08
And then he said that those televands were found without their heads hanging on a tree

1835
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:18.84
the next couple of days later with an ISIS stamp flat, an ex to it basically saying anybody

1836
01:40:18.84 --> 01:40:22.48
who removes these bodies is going to kind of be next.

1837
01:40:22.48 --> 01:40:26.96
And he said eventually that is someone from another district came to collect them.

1838
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:31.52
But they were just hanging there on that tree for many days because people were afraid

1839
01:40:31.52 --> 01:40:32.52
of ISIS.

1840
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:36.44
And he said that every night sort of you ISIS comes in.

1841
01:40:36.44 --> 01:40:38.32
They come in and take control.

1842
01:40:38.32 --> 01:40:41.40
But during the day, it's very much the Taliban doing patrol.

1843
01:40:41.40 --> 01:40:43.48
The Taliban gets scared and disappear.

1844
01:40:43.48 --> 01:40:48.64
And then the ISIS fighters come in at night and he even showed me his own warning letter.

1845
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:53.000
He got from the telebens for doing a local news interview after that during strike.

1846
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.08
And then he said that the televands are the interview and, and brewed then accusing him

1847
01:40:57.08 --> 01:41:00.28
of being the one that gave the location to the foreigners.

1848
01:41:00.28 --> 01:41:02.08
So it's complex.

1849
01:41:02.08 --> 01:41:07.84
And then the actual ISIS controlled center where a lot of these people come from is the

1850
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:09.72
next district over which is Chapagar.

1851
01:41:09.72 --> 01:41:18.80
So we went into that one day which I don't know was as soon as decision but I'm here today.

1852
01:41:18.80 --> 01:41:23.96
You should play lottery because you went a lot.

1853
01:41:23.96 --> 01:41:29.32
So I know you left what the first first of December.

1854
01:41:29.32 --> 01:41:30.32
Yes.

1855
01:41:30.32 --> 01:41:35.32
So like a few days ago, a few weeks ago.

1856
01:41:35.32 --> 01:41:39.28
As you look back to anything else, any other high points from there, I mean there's a bunch

1857
01:41:39.28 --> 01:41:40.64
of stuff for you.

1858
01:41:40.64 --> 01:41:45.20
You know, on your website, you've got a link to a bunch of the articles that you know.

1859
01:41:45.20 --> 01:41:50.80
And I have a sub-stack that I also described to that and I usually put all the articles

1860
01:41:50.80 --> 01:41:53.44
into that and also a little bit of extra kind of background.

1861
01:41:53.44 --> 01:41:54.92
So how do they get to the sub-stack?

1862
01:41:54.92 --> 01:41:58.68
So it's just you can get it straight from my website or it's just yeah.

1863
01:41:58.68 --> 01:41:59.92
And your website is what?

1864
01:41:59.92 --> 01:42:00.92
Holly, my K.

1865
01:42:00.92 --> 01:42:04.40
H-O-L-L-I-E-M-C-K-A-Y dot com.

1866
01:42:04.40 --> 01:42:05.40
There you go.

1867
01:42:05.40 --> 01:42:06.40
And then you can get to the sub-stack.

1868
01:42:06.40 --> 01:42:07.40
Yep.

1869
01:42:07.40 --> 01:42:08.56
I'll tell there.

1870
01:42:08.56 --> 01:42:14.92
But as you look at what's going on, what's going on now?

1871
01:42:14.92 --> 01:42:16.04
This is a disaster.

1872
01:42:16.04 --> 01:42:24.20
I mean, I know one thing that you'd mentioned to me is like, and it's sort of the, I guess

1873
01:42:24.20 --> 01:42:33.52
the ground or the most granular sort of point zero for the disaster is like what happened

1874
01:42:33.52 --> 01:42:36.52
in the military working dogs that got left behind.

1875
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:39.28
And that was such a big story for everybody remembers.

1876
01:42:39.28 --> 01:42:44.12
There was about 130 dogs and you see these pictures of them at the airport.

1877
01:42:44.12 --> 01:42:49.40
And so I wanted to follow up on that and find out what happened to those dogs because the

1878
01:42:49.40 --> 01:42:53.84
DOD was very quickly to come out and say they weren't US military dogs, but they were

1879
01:42:53.84 --> 01:42:54.84
contracted dogs.

1880
01:42:54.84 --> 01:43:01.24
So the long story short is that the, you know, different contracting companies had given those

1881
01:43:01.24 --> 01:43:06.32
dogs to a complex, small and at more rescue, which is run by a woman named Charlotte.

1882
01:43:06.32 --> 01:43:08.16
And she was tasked with getting them out.

1883
01:43:08.16 --> 01:43:12.80
But when she got to the airport was basically told, you know, you can't get all these dogs

1884
01:43:12.80 --> 01:43:16.72
in the plane and you can only take out what you can carry.

1885
01:43:16.72 --> 01:43:18.04
So there was a lot of controversy.

1886
01:43:18.04 --> 01:43:20.64
Oh my gosh, these dogs are being abandoned.

1887
01:43:20.64 --> 01:43:25.16
But you know, she's someone who really does amazing work in rescuing these animals and

1888
01:43:25.16 --> 01:43:26.16
caring for them.

1889
01:43:26.16 --> 01:43:28.80
So I wanted to follow up and find out what happened to them.

1890
01:43:28.80 --> 01:43:33.36
And I talked to her and she said they were confident about 70.

1891
01:43:33.36 --> 01:43:37.52
Most of them were not, half probably been killed by the telebands.

1892
01:43:37.52 --> 01:43:42.04
And then you had, so a lot of the spanials, which are very friendly dogs, had run up to

1893
01:43:42.04 --> 01:43:45.68
the telebands and the telebands just, and they don't have dogs as pets.

1894
01:43:45.68 --> 01:43:48.76
When they had the rule in the 90s, dogs were outlawed.

1895
01:43:48.76 --> 01:43:50.48
They considered unclean by the telebands.

1896
01:43:50.48 --> 01:43:52.64
You can have cats, but not dogs.

1897
01:43:52.64 --> 01:43:57.16
So a lot of them were shot and then they sort of saw that these dogs had gotten so much

1898
01:43:57.16 --> 01:44:00.12
attention and thought, well, this is a bit of a bargaining chip.

1899
01:44:00.12 --> 01:44:03.08
So they kept a lot of the German chapels because they thought that a lot of the German

1900
01:44:03.08 --> 01:44:06.92
chapels must be guard dogs even though a lot of them were not trained at guard dogs.

1901
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:10.84
But you see, especially the airport and other places, the telebands were walking around

1902
01:44:10.84 --> 01:44:13.84
these dogs that they have no idea what they're doing.

1903
01:44:13.84 --> 01:44:17.28
Like, these dogs, like, they don't look like, you know.

1904
01:44:17.28 --> 01:44:19.000
So some of them survived.

1905
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.08
Some of them were left to run around the airport compound and some of them got out.

1906
01:44:23.08 --> 01:44:26.04
So yeah, it was a sad situation.

1907
01:44:26.04 --> 01:44:30.08
And we can debate for days, you know, obviously humans have to get priority over dogs.

1908
01:44:30.08 --> 01:44:32.000
But I think we all can agree.

1909
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
We love Owen.

1910
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Yes.

1911
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yeah.

1912
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.24
Well, what about the human, the human, the humanitarian perspective of what's going

1913
01:44:37.24 --> 01:44:38.24
on there now?

1914
01:44:38.24 --> 01:44:39.76
It's an absolute disaster.

1915
01:44:39.76 --> 01:44:45.04
And that is the heartbreaking thing is the, to give you some context when I got there,

1916
01:44:45.04 --> 01:44:48.04
it was 70 Afghans to won US dollar.

1917
01:44:48.04 --> 01:44:50.68
It was 100 by the time I left.

1918
01:44:50.68 --> 01:44:56.76
So that just shows you how quickly that devalued their Afghani devalued the currency.

1919
01:44:56.76 --> 01:45:00.64
People kind of fled bread, people kind of forward just basic things there.

1920
01:45:00.64 --> 01:45:03.04
There is no middle class in Afghanistan anymore.

1921
01:45:03.04 --> 01:45:06.92
It's people are selling their belongings on the street.

1922
01:45:06.92 --> 01:45:08.32
Crime has gone through the roof again.

1923
01:45:08.32 --> 01:45:11.16
It dropped initially because I think people were in fear that they were going to get

1924
01:45:11.16 --> 01:45:14.88
the hands chopped off and when it became prevalent, that wasn't going to happen, at least

1925
01:45:14.88 --> 01:45:16.60
not right now.

1926
01:45:16.60 --> 01:45:17.88
The crime went back up.

1927
01:45:17.88 --> 01:45:21.64
And it's, you go to these public hospitals.

1928
01:45:21.64 --> 01:45:26.76
And I mean, they were just that the amount of malnourished babies that are just dying

1929
01:45:26.76 --> 01:45:29.80
on mass and the mothers are on the floor breastfeeding.

1930
01:45:29.80 --> 01:45:34.12
And it was something I really just never seen to that degree.

1931
01:45:34.12 --> 01:45:38.16
And it broke my heart because of the amount of money that we as Americans and the amount

1932
01:45:38.16 --> 01:45:42.72
of treasurer and the amount of people in the amount of, you know, effort that had been put

1933
01:45:42.72 --> 01:45:43.72
into this.

1934
01:45:43.72 --> 01:45:45.64
And this was a result.

1935
01:45:45.64 --> 01:45:51.52
And it's only going to get worse during the winter and the US and other countries

1936
01:45:51.52 --> 01:45:58.04
are going to have to make this very uncomfortable decision of, do we unfreeze this money?

1937
01:45:58.04 --> 01:46:04.24
This 9.5 billion, that was frozen when the telebans took over in the World Bank and international

1938
01:46:04.24 --> 01:46:06.52
monetary fund also froze.

1939
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:13.36
Do we unfreeze that in a naval, this government to support a country of 38 million?

1940
01:46:13.36 --> 01:46:14.64
Because there is no money coming in.

1941
01:46:14.64 --> 01:46:15.84
There's absolutely no money.

1942
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:17.84
You cannot get money out of the banks.

1943
01:46:17.84 --> 01:46:24.24
Yeah, it was very challenging to work in because of that environment.

1944
01:46:24.24 --> 01:46:28.36
But we're going to have to make this decision of, do we work with this government so that

1945
01:46:28.36 --> 01:46:33.12
these innocent Afghan people who have already gone through so much can survive and have

1946
01:46:33.12 --> 01:46:35.56
some kind of dignity in their lives?

1947
01:46:35.56 --> 01:46:39.76
Or are we going to just, I guess, turn away and say no, no, these people, human rights

1948
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:44.40
filate is we are not going to talk to them and to isolate them.

1949
01:46:44.40 --> 01:46:49.36
And I always look back in history and I hope that we don't make the same mistake because

1950
01:46:49.36 --> 01:46:53.88
there was no more isolated government than the Taliban during their first reign in the

1951
01:46:53.88 --> 01:46:56.08
90s through 2001.

1952
01:46:56.08 --> 01:46:59.40
They were blackboard by everybody and they had no money.

1953
01:46:59.40 --> 01:47:03.72
The one person who came in and gave them money and not very much, 1.5 million I think

1954
01:47:03.72 --> 01:47:06.08
it was, was a summer bin Laden.

1955
01:47:06.08 --> 01:47:10.48
He's the one who came in and gave them money and so naturally they were going to protect

1956
01:47:10.48 --> 01:47:11.48
him.

1957
01:47:11.48 --> 01:47:15.16
Initially when the US said, hand him over, Mueller, I must said no.

1958
01:47:15.16 --> 01:47:17.28
He's the only one who came in and gave us money.

1959
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:21.36
So it's a very complex decision and there's going to be a lot of people that feel very

1960
01:47:21.36 --> 01:47:27.40
strongly in many ways but it's an uncomfortable decision that needs to be made on a diplomatic

1961
01:47:27.40 --> 01:47:32.36
level of how we're going to deal with this because I think the Afghan people are being

1962
01:47:32.36 --> 01:47:38.48
through enough and they don't deserve any, they don't deserve to suffer their ramifications

1963
01:47:38.48 --> 01:47:41.44
of this anymore than they already have.

1964
01:47:41.44 --> 01:47:44.52
And that's sort of the uncomfortable choice.

1965
01:47:44.52 --> 01:47:47.44
There isn't many options.

1966
01:47:47.44 --> 01:47:53.28
Do you, as when you got back to America, I guess it's been a couple days ago, but even

1967
01:47:53.28 --> 01:47:59.20
as you were overseas and you were online and you were looking at the way that the stories

1968
01:47:59.20 --> 01:48:05.76
were being presented and the way that the events were being presented with now, the way

1969
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:08.84
the media and social media and emotional media are working out.

1970
01:48:08.84 --> 01:48:14.28
What was the delta between what you were seeing and what the world was being fed?

1971
01:48:14.28 --> 01:48:15.44
There was quite as a codomy.

1972
01:48:15.44 --> 01:48:19.28
So if I was just to look at Twitter and to look at what was happening, I would think there

1973
01:48:19.28 --> 01:48:20.68
was mass slaughter on the street.

1974
01:48:20.68 --> 01:48:25.60
I would think that the Taliban's were going out and pulling people from their homes and

1975
01:48:25.60 --> 01:48:30.80
certainly there are isolated cases of that happening but that was very much the exception

1976
01:48:30.80 --> 01:48:32.12
not the norm.

1977
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:34.40
And that was not accurately reflected.

1978
01:48:34.40 --> 01:48:41.40
I think a strange as it is, the Taliban's were trying to show this image of, they want

1979
01:48:41.40 --> 01:48:42.72
to be recognized.

1980
01:48:42.72 --> 01:48:46.12
Is it safe to say that the Taliban is trying to re-brand?

1981
01:48:46.12 --> 01:48:47.76
Yes, absolutely.

1982
01:48:47.76 --> 01:48:53.60
And I think there's a lot of, I hear a lot of, well they haven't changed since 2000 or

1983
01:48:53.60 --> 01:48:54.60
their first reins in the 90s.

1984
01:48:54.60 --> 01:48:56.04
And I don't think that's accurate.

1985
01:48:56.04 --> 01:48:57.04
They have changed.

1986
01:48:57.04 --> 01:49:00.40
They've changed a lot in many different respects.

1987
01:49:00.40 --> 01:49:06.92
But yeah, a lot of the information I was seeing about these mass slaughteres and I think

1988
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:10.64
there was one thing where, and a lot of people had asked me about it, there was a room

1989
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:13.72
of going around about a girl that had been beheaded by the Taliban and when I looked

1990
01:49:13.72 --> 01:49:18.68
into it and asked my fix, I looked into it and it turned out that she had been killed in July.

1991
01:49:18.68 --> 01:49:22.28
So before the Taliban's came in, but it was an internal family conflict.

1992
01:49:22.28 --> 01:49:27.32
It had nothing to do with, and yet this was being presented as this just happened last

1993
01:49:27.32 --> 01:49:28.32
week.

1994
01:49:28.32 --> 01:49:32.24
And she's being beheaded and I saw like Kim Gidae sharing or someone was then re-tweeting

1995
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:36.08
it and putting it on a story and then a million more people are asking me.

1996
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:39.28
And I thought this is how this cycle perpetuates.

1997
01:49:39.28 --> 01:49:45.32
But if I was to sum up the situation, it was certainly terrible things were happening.

1998
01:49:45.32 --> 01:49:48.48
But it wasn't what was being painted.

1999
01:49:48.48 --> 01:49:53.04
As I said, I could work freely and unhamed.

2000
01:49:53.04 --> 01:49:54.80
And I was only wearing a job.

2001
01:49:54.80 --> 01:50:00.28
So a lot of the information was wrong and there was something even so there was a picture

2002
01:50:00.28 --> 01:50:04.44
that was going around where it was a woman in a book or she had a train around her ankle

2003
01:50:04.44 --> 01:50:09.32
and was being led by a husband and people was saying, this is Afghanistan now and the

2004
01:50:09.32 --> 01:50:10.32
Taliban.

2005
01:50:10.32 --> 01:50:14.76
I looked at a quick reverse image search and you see, oh no, that was 2003 or so.

2006
01:50:14.76 --> 01:50:17.60
Somebody photoshopped a chain to this woman's ankle.

2007
01:50:17.60 --> 01:50:20.28
So there was so much of that.

2008
01:50:20.28 --> 01:50:25.12
And I think there really were few journalists that were in there.

2009
01:50:25.12 --> 01:50:27.08
I didn't meet too many other Americans.

2010
01:50:27.08 --> 01:50:30.72
I met a couple of Americans that came in and left again.

2011
01:50:30.72 --> 01:50:34.24
But generally there was just a few European journalists that came in.

2012
01:50:34.24 --> 01:50:37.96
And so a lot of the work was being done from outside the country.

2013
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:41.76
And I think it just shows you the importance of being on the grounds and a lot of news

2014
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:45.40
organizations don't want to invest in that anymore.

2015
01:50:45.40 --> 01:50:49.52
But Afghanistan really showed me the importance of having that ground perspective because

2016
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:55.04
it's so different to what you see just sort of an aggregating or even talking to people.

2017
01:50:55.04 --> 01:51:00.72
And I think a lot of interviews were talking to the diaspora people that had fled.

2018
01:51:00.72 --> 01:51:04.000
But their perspective was no longer in Afghanistan.

2019
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.44
So yeah, there's a lot of disinformation.

2020
01:51:07.44 --> 01:51:11.08
Yeah, it'll be no one knows, right?

2021
01:51:11.08 --> 01:51:14.40
We don't know what the Taliban's going to do.

2022
01:51:14.40 --> 01:51:26.000
Now they were pretty brutal in their last time in power from 1995, 1996, up until 2001,

2023
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.60
up until the Northern Alliance in America went in there.

2024
01:51:29.60 --> 01:51:34.72
And I mean, they had some bad things happened, right?

2025
01:51:34.72 --> 01:51:39.56
Starvation and just bad stuff happened.

2026
01:51:39.56 --> 01:51:40.96
I mean, horrible.

2027
01:51:40.96 --> 01:51:47.28
So definitely human rights violations and all that stuff absolutely has happened.

2028
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:51.80
And you know, there was obviously there were some reports of terrible things happening again.

2029
01:51:51.80 --> 01:51:54.92
And it's hard to know.

2030
01:51:54.92 --> 01:52:02.24
But to your point, unless you have people on the ground, it's very, it's makes it even

2031
01:52:02.24 --> 01:52:05.84
more difficult to actually know what's happening and make decisions on what you're going

2032
01:52:05.84 --> 01:52:09.28
to do when you're basing it on Photoshop images.

2033
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:13.32
Yeah, absolutely.

2034
01:52:13.32 --> 01:52:15.52
You mentioned Osama bin Laden.

2035
01:52:15.52 --> 01:52:24.000
What was talked to us a little bit about Osama bin Laden's presence in the psyche

2036
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.52
of the Afghan people now.

2037
01:52:27.52 --> 01:52:29.000
What did you observe from that perspective?

2038
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.60
Yeah, so I really think you, he's legacy is still very strong in Afghanistan.

2039
01:52:33.60 --> 01:52:39.08
And even places that I went to, you know, again, the Jalalabad, the information and culture

2040
01:52:39.08 --> 01:52:42.60
and this, there is told me, don't do any stories on a song within Laden.

2041
01:52:42.60 --> 01:52:43.84
So I was like, oh, you wait.

2042
01:52:43.84 --> 01:52:44.84
You wait now.

2043
01:52:44.84 --> 01:52:47.12
I'm going.

2044
01:52:47.12 --> 01:52:50.32
So, but you see that legacy sort of carry through.

2045
01:52:50.32 --> 01:52:52.12
And they're all in power because of him.

2046
01:52:52.12 --> 01:52:56.60
And again, it goes back to he's the one who sort of came in and gave them money when no

2047
01:52:56.60 --> 01:52:58.000
one else would.

2048
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.52
And so in return for that, they gave him, gave him safe harbor.

2049
01:53:01.52 --> 01:53:07.72
And it's under that code of pastion wally, which is really the highest moral code that the

2050
01:53:07.72 --> 01:53:10.56
pastions have in protecting guests.

2051
01:53:10.56 --> 01:53:14.92
And it's the same code that they used to protect somebody like me who's a guest in their

2052
01:53:14.92 --> 01:53:15.92
country.

2053
01:53:15.92 --> 01:53:18.96
So it's a very complex sort of thing.

2054
01:53:18.96 --> 01:53:24.36
But when you talk to regular Afghans or students or people that, you know, in their

2055
01:53:24.36 --> 01:53:28.40
young 20-something, they don't know who he is.

2056
01:53:28.40 --> 01:53:34.16
And it's just interesting because you sort of look at this war and you, that was continuing

2057
01:53:34.16 --> 01:53:39.76
to go on and, and yet you sort of have the people that are caught in the crossfire who just

2058
01:53:39.76 --> 01:53:46.08
sort of have no idea of what happened and what the background is and why this is all kind

2059
01:53:46.08 --> 01:53:47.12
of still going on.

2060
01:53:47.12 --> 01:53:48.84
So it's interesting.

2061
01:53:48.84 --> 01:53:52.48
And I'll kind of still, you know, certainly exist in Afghanistan too.

2062
01:53:52.48 --> 01:53:57.56
My understanding from the telebands is that they've been told that they are not allowed

2063
01:53:57.56 --> 01:54:01.28
to do any take any military actions that they have to, you know, they're allowed to be in

2064
01:54:01.28 --> 01:54:06.96
the country, but they have to, to stop, you know, not plan anything or do anything otherwise

2065
01:54:06.96 --> 01:54:07.96
they'll be in trouble.

2066
01:54:07.96 --> 01:54:12.12
But I think a lot of the times, too, a lot of those out of Kyra members have just been basically

2067
01:54:12.12 --> 01:54:18.40
folded into the Taliban's and a part of the intelligence units or a part of that whole

2068
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:19.40
operation.

2069
01:54:19.40 --> 01:54:23.24
Yeah, I was definitely some of your articles mentioned the fact that, you know, some

2070
01:54:23.24 --> 01:54:27.52
20-year-old Afghan didn't really know who Osama bin Laden was.

2071
01:54:27.52 --> 01:54:28.52
Yeah.

2072
01:54:28.52 --> 01:54:35.32
So sometimes when I get into discussions with people about the divisiveness in America,

2073
01:54:35.32 --> 01:54:39.12
I'll reference the fact that I work with a bunch of different companies, am I consulting

2074
01:54:39.12 --> 01:54:47.24
company and most people that you talk to, they're not thinking about what's happening on

2075
01:54:47.24 --> 01:54:48.24
Twitter right now.

2076
01:54:48.24 --> 01:54:51.36
They're not thinking about what they're doing, they're thinking about their job, they're

2077
01:54:51.36 --> 01:54:54.48
thinking about their company, they're thinking about moving, you know, how they're going

2078
01:54:54.48 --> 01:54:56.20
to grow, how they're going to go new markets.

2079
01:54:56.20 --> 01:54:57.20
That's what they're thinking about.

2080
01:54:57.20 --> 01:54:58.20
That's what they're doing.

2081
01:54:58.20 --> 01:55:02.24
Is it similar?

2082
01:55:02.24 --> 01:55:06.72
I mean, I guess this is a rhetorical question, but did you find the same thing?

2083
01:55:06.72 --> 01:55:10.12
And Afghanistan, most people are like, okay, well, the Taliban's in charge of the Northern

2084
01:55:10.12 --> 01:55:14.84
Alliance in charge, I want to, you know, continue to get my job done and raise my family

2085
01:55:14.84 --> 01:55:18.72
and move kind of forward, like, kind of leave me alone type thing.

2086
01:55:18.72 --> 01:55:19.72
Yeah, two camps.

2087
01:55:19.72 --> 01:55:24.24
You have the people who's in tie a day is, it's fixed I didn't trying to get out.

2088
01:55:24.24 --> 01:55:25.24
Trying to get out of Afghanistan.

2089
01:55:25.24 --> 01:55:26.24
You're trying to get out.

2090
01:55:26.24 --> 01:55:29.24
You're trying to get out of the way to camps and, you know, even now, just every day,

2091
01:55:29.24 --> 01:55:32.24
all day, my message is my LinkedIn, everything is just flooded.

2092
01:55:32.24 --> 01:55:34.24
How do I get out?

2093
01:55:34.24 --> 01:55:39.24
So you have that camp and then you have another camp of people who would just basically,

2094
01:55:39.24 --> 01:55:43.24
I know that I can't go anywhere and this is the new reality.

2095
01:55:43.24 --> 01:55:46.24
So how do I survive and how do I feed my family?

2096
01:55:46.24 --> 01:55:48.24
And that's really what it comes down to.

2097
01:55:48.24 --> 01:55:54.24
It comes down to survival, especially now with the crisis being what it is there and the challenges

2098
01:55:54.24 --> 01:55:55.24
of just day-to-day life.

2099
01:55:55.24 --> 01:56:02.24
What are people when so many messages you get 10 messages about, I want to get out, I want to get out.

2100
01:56:02.24 --> 01:56:03.24
Why do they want to get out?

2101
01:56:03.24 --> 01:56:05.24
What do they, what's it, they really really, really.

2102
01:56:05.24 --> 01:56:09.24
And it's a mix that you have, you have people that are certainly have legitimate reasons to get out.

2103
01:56:09.24 --> 01:56:15.24
A lot of the commandos that I met with that are interrified because the commandos were really leading the charge and a lot of the fights.

2104
01:56:15.24 --> 01:56:18.24
And they're very concerned about retaliation.

2105
01:56:18.24 --> 01:56:24.24
But then you have a lot of people who, who, and again, what I found, a lot of people who were maybe drivers

2106
01:56:24.24 --> 01:56:27.24
or worked for different companies who were desperate and terrified to get out.

2107
01:56:27.24 --> 01:56:31.24
But when I talk to them, I say, well, where's the threat?

2108
01:56:31.24 --> 01:56:38.24
Nobody's been threatened or they're passing around or what's at the letter that everybody's been given that's fake or.

2109
01:56:38.24 --> 01:56:42.24
So, in a way that the fear is contagious.

2110
01:56:42.24 --> 01:56:45.24
And again, that's where I'm saying the fear doesn't always match the reality.

2111
01:56:45.24 --> 01:56:51.24
And what I found was that people thought, well, so-and-so scared and my neighbor scared and everybody scared,

2112
01:56:51.24 --> 01:56:54.24
so I'm going to have to be scared too and I'm going to have to leave.

2113
01:56:54.24 --> 01:57:06.24
So, that, yeah, it was contagious and that's what I found that a lot of the, the worries were self-inflicted as opposed to an actual real threat that was then.

2114
01:57:06.24 --> 01:57:11.24
It's got to be like a massive level though of like suppression, right?

2115
01:57:11.24 --> 01:57:18.24
I mean, if you're a person that was sort of open-minded and moving in this direction and now like it's over.

2116
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:23.24
Yeah, and, and you don't get that, and especially for women too, you know, that's deeply challenging.

2117
01:57:23.24 --> 01:57:30.24
Girls are still not able to go to public school, the private schools are still open, but secondary schools have been closed for girls now for months.

2118
01:57:30.24 --> 01:57:35.24
And the Taliban's keeps saying, because we've got to make sure that they have transport that separate to the man.

2119
01:57:35.24 --> 01:57:37.24
And I said, well, great, we'll get you some buses.

2120
01:57:37.24 --> 01:57:39.24
Oh, and then there's another excuse.

2121
01:57:39.24 --> 01:57:46.24
So, I'm not sure what's happening with that, but you know, women that we're definitely used to going to work into other places and they're at home.

2122
01:57:46.24 --> 01:57:48.24
And, you know, that's heartbreaking.

2123
01:57:48.24 --> 01:57:56.24
Women, you know, I met with many women who, you know, were doing, you know, in the national sort of tech one do teams or in the national tennis team.

2124
01:57:56.24 --> 01:57:58.24
Yeah, it was a big article about their soccer team too.

2125
01:57:58.24 --> 01:58:08.24
Yeah, you know, and now that then they're not allowed to do there, you know, to not even practice, let alone go into any tournaments.

2126
01:58:08.24 --> 01:58:13.24
Even I met with the top MMA guy there as well, is, you know, great fighter.

2127
01:58:13.24 --> 01:58:18.24
I think two fights away from UFC. And he's like, we can't fight anymore. And he said that he tried to do a fight.

2128
01:58:18.24 --> 01:58:23.24
The Taliban's told him that they have to wear like full clothing, which he said, you know, we obviously can't do that.

2129
01:58:23.24 --> 01:58:28.24
And the Taliban's came to their first fight and broke it up and kind of took a big mess.

2130
01:58:28.24 --> 01:58:33.24
But, you know, he's concerned because, you know, he can't get out, but he's trying.

2131
01:58:33.24 --> 01:58:41.24
But, you know, he's someone who used to go to each match with, you know, the police, you know, Afghan police flag.

2132
01:58:41.24 --> 01:58:50.24
Again, it was very, it spurred the former security forces. And so, you know, it's tough for the guys too, even though they can do well, you know, a little bit more than the women.

2133
01:58:50.24 --> 01:58:56.24
But music is completely kind of outlawed and arts and all those sorts of things.

2134
01:58:56.24 --> 01:59:03.24
Yeah, you're not allowed to paint any people, you know, the painting, any living things or film, any living things or photograph, any living things.

2135
01:59:03.24 --> 01:59:06.24
Yeah, well, they haven't been too strict about that.

2136
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:11.24
But, yeah, instruments have been outlawed. Yeah, except for like some drum.

2137
01:59:11.24 --> 01:59:16.24
Yeah, well, they have this, they're music is this in sheet music. It's just a drumming crazy.

2138
01:59:16.24 --> 01:59:24.24
So they would get into the car and they'd put in, you know, insist and if we're driving somewhere remote and time telebands would get in the car.

2139
01:59:24.24 --> 01:59:30.24
And they'd put in their machines and it was just this Islamic music without instruments, it's all vocals.

2140
01:59:30.24 --> 01:59:37.24
And then there's bomb blasts and bullets and just like, and they ton it up and I was like, it's like their motivations and battlefield music.

2141
01:59:37.24 --> 01:59:44.24
And it's like, this is crazy. And that's what they play on the night. And the telebands actually moved next door to the house that I was living in.

2142
01:59:44.24 --> 01:59:46.24
So I would deliberately go and get my two back in.

2143
01:59:46.24 --> 01:59:49.24
I began to splast it.

2144
01:59:49.24 --> 01:59:51.24
I think I'm used to it.

2145
01:59:51.24 --> 01:59:54.24
I was like, you know, what's time to go Holy Hill.

2146
01:59:54.24 --> 02:00:04.24
So here's what I find, this is what's so hard to really contemplate as a human being, right?

2147
02:00:04.24 --> 02:00:12.24
What percentage of people are, are, are don't want it to be this way, right?

2148
02:00:12.24 --> 02:00:15.24
What percentage of people don't want it to be this way?

2149
02:00:15.24 --> 02:00:30.24
And would give anything to go back to whatever, to 2000 and 19 and be moving in a certain direction and have the females ready to go to school and be able to play or guitar and be able to do MMA.

2150
02:00:30.24 --> 02:00:42.24
What percentage of the population feels that way versus what percentage of the population wants to go back to the old teleband ways and strict, sharia law.

2151
02:00:42.24 --> 02:00:46.24
I'm not asking you, you can, you can make an estimation, but it's very difficult.

2152
02:00:46.24 --> 02:00:59.24
And then, okay, if you're that, if you're the 90% is on board for sharia law, and that's what we're doing and hey, the 10% that aren't on board with it, you best get out of here because this is what we're doing.

2153
02:00:59.24 --> 02:01:09.24
Or is it 90% of the population wants to just go back to again 2019, moving that direction, move towards a more open society.

2154
02:01:09.24 --> 02:01:22.24
And if that's the case and it's just a strict small percentage of people that maintain power and control via force and brutality, well then then then what are we supposed to do?

2155
02:01:22.24 --> 02:01:30.24
So I think there's really, again, when we see with the media what we're seeing is always generally coverage that's coming out of Kabul or coming out of a city.

2156
02:01:30.24 --> 02:01:38.24
And I tried to really make an effort to to to go to as many rural areas and provinces because the perspective there is completely different.

2157
02:01:38.24 --> 02:01:56.24
So I'd say if you're going to estimate in someone like Kabul, 80% of people want that previous life because they were able to do not, that was bars, it was music that you know could go to clubs, you could go to, you know, get alcohol, you could do all of these things because you had that foreign footprint there.

2158
02:01:56.24 --> 02:02:07.24
But you go to the villages and you know, that are already very conservative where the women don't necessarily, you know, go to school past the age of 13 and that are very much relegated to the home.

2159
02:02:07.24 --> 02:02:12.24
And they don't leave and that's just cost-a-marry because that's the way that their life is.

2160
02:02:12.24 --> 02:02:18.24
Their lives are actually going to get better and I say that because they don't have to face the daily bombings anymore.

2161
02:02:18.24 --> 02:02:30.24
They don't have to deal with the ramifications of war but their actual lives aren't going to change because they were never really privy to all those sort of new western insbyte if you will, freedoms.

2162
02:02:30.24 --> 02:02:43.24
So you can make the argument that, you know, for them, they now have a more peaceful life. But in the cities, that's where you really see women and people losing a lot of those freedoms and suffering.

2163
02:02:43.24 --> 02:02:56.24
But but what I think is also interesting that came out of this was the number of, of Taliban's that were embedded into the military, into the government, into every possible avenue in every city.

2164
02:02:56.24 --> 02:03:07.24
And suddenly when the Taliban's were able to take power, these people came out, people I knew, for years and years and years who were working with journalists, it's fixes, said to me, oh yeah, being Taliban for 20 years.

2165
02:03:07.24 --> 02:03:16.24
And now they're out, you know, and so, in friends of mine, you know, I had it, you know, even with my fixer, and good friend of his, he was saying that someone he's known since he was very young.

2166
02:03:16.24 --> 02:03:25.24
When the Taliban's took power, suddenly he finds out his Taliban, like it's just, these people kept secrets for so long and I think that's also why the Taliban's were able to come to power so quickly.

2167
02:03:25.24 --> 02:03:33.24
They infiltrated every possible, you know, government entity that they could.

2168
02:03:33.24 --> 02:03:41.24
What do they do? What's the Taliban doing with their, with the military equipment that they took over?

2169
02:03:41.24 --> 02:03:51.24
So I, you know, was interesting. So I did a tour of the airport just before I left and you still see a lot of the damaged aircraft, the US blew up a lot of the aircraft before it left.

2170
02:03:51.24 --> 02:04:05.24
They still have all those Russian Russian helicopters that are still there and and they have a lot of entities. They brought back a lot of the technicians from the previous government trained by the US that are now there able to to help, you know, repair whatever they can.

2171
02:04:05.24 --> 02:04:15.24
And they still do have very limited our power, but I know that something they're trying to build because the Air Force is something that they want that they didn't have before.

2172
02:04:15.24 --> 02:04:27.24
And it was funny because I was sitting outside, you know, one, one afternoon and and you see there was, there was a big blast, a big bomb and the smokes in the air and it was just, it was down at the military hospital very close.

2173
02:04:27.24 --> 02:04:43.24
And next thing you know, you hear in choppers in the air and I said, I haven't heard this for ages, you know, was going on and they were flying a black hawk and two of the Russian MH17s and they had apparently dropped a suicide bomb on to the hospital because ISIS was attacking it.

2174
02:04:43.24 --> 02:05:01.24
Again, they're still using suicide bombers for situations like that, but yeah, craziness. So it was an ongoing, it wasn't ongoing, you know, thing, but, but so they certainly have the capacity if they need it, but they're saying, we're just going to use it for important and urgent circumstances.

2175
02:05:01.24 --> 02:05:11.24
The other thing is, is backwards, but yeah, actually went to a suicide bombing school that I found, which was in a kindergarten on the Air DeCarble where they trained the suicide bombers.

2176
02:05:11.24 --> 02:05:29.24
You know, when you have these managers begging, begging to be chosen, just pick me, pick me, it's like the highest, I don't know that they could possibly take and, and you know, the, if despite being in government now, there's no plans to get rid of the suicide bombing schools.

2177
02:05:29.24 --> 02:05:43.24
How about what do you see in for a lessons as you look at it now, you're looking back on it, you've been gone for a week now, what are you looking at, what, what kind of big picture strategic lessons are you saying?

2178
02:05:43.24 --> 02:06:07.24
My biggest thing that, to, to drive home is, you know, we can talk all day about military strategies and, and the Taliban military strategies, but at the end of the day, and I feel like I'm a broken record saying this, but corruption, corruption, corruption, the last government backed by the US, there was so much corruption every possible level to the point where,

2179
02:06:07.24 --> 02:06:17.24
if you wanted to go and get an interview at the US embassy, just an interview, if you were a university graduate who wanted to get a job at the embassy, because that was a cool thing to do.

2180
02:06:17.24 --> 02:06:27.24
You had to pay a middle person about $5,000, just to get an interview, let alone if you were to get a job, and then you'd pay them a whole bunch more, and that was in every government institution.

2181
02:06:27.24 --> 02:06:43.24
Money, you know, and, and this is what I would get angry about, because I would tell a lot of these, I've got to say that's my money. As a US taxpayer, you stole our money, or not, you personally, but you're a previous government, you stole our money, and you took that and you lined your pockets.

2182
02:06:43.24 --> 02:07:10.24
And then, the corruption on every level was just so rampant and so disgusting, and even when, you know, a lot of these wallards and people were fleeing the country and the tallybs of taking over, there was chunks of gold that they were keeping, you know, hidden underground, just wards of cash that, just unfathomable numbers.

2183
02:07:10.24 --> 02:07:29.24
There was not a thing that you could do to get through daily life without paying a bribe, you know, to get through a checkpoint, you're paying a bribe, to get whatever you need it, like, life for afghans was difficult, because of this institutionalized corruption, that I think the US looked at, and said, well, this is too systemic for us to do anything about, we just have to leave it.

2184
02:07:29.24 --> 02:07:51.24
But really, to me, that was the root of the problem. So people looked at that, afghans looked at that, and we're like, why am I starving here when this local governor is rolling around and with all this money and rolls, rolls, and all these fancy things, and I can't, you know, I have to pay every time just to get to my job.

2185
02:07:51.24 --> 02:08:12.24
And that's what the, the tallyben really capitalized on that. They capitalized on where we are not going to be corrupt, you know, that's against Islam. We are going to, you know, support everybody, treat everybody the same. And so people that didn't even ideologically want to be, you know, with the tallyben's, they were driven to that, and I have seen that in many countries.

2186
02:08:12.24 --> 02:08:28.24
You want to fight against the government that you feel is stealing from you, and it just got to the point where it was, it was so bad you had, you had judges in provinces or a lawyer's, like, just falsely accusing people of something, and taking them to court. So they could get bread money.

2187
02:08:28.24 --> 02:08:44.24
So it just, and it was just, it was on the every possible level, even even at the hospitals, you had medical staff stealing the supply, so they could go and sell them at a local pharmacy or because they owned their own pharmacy. And that was going to pay them better money than the government's salary. So,

2188
02:08:44.24 --> 02:09:04.24
you know, if you're going to go into a country or give country any sort of form of foreign aid, I hope that the US or in the countries can learn that lesson of, if you don't stop that right in the beginning, if you don't hold people accountable, and there was, there was never accountability to any of the corruption or stolen money.

2189
02:09:04.24 --> 02:09:16.24
This is the result you're going to get, and I saw that in Iraq too, with, you know, people joining ISIS because they wanted to fight back against the government, who they felt was stealing from them, were corrupt and was suppressing them.

2190
02:09:16.24 --> 02:09:24.24
And it wasn't about, we want to be part of ISIS because we agree with ISIS, it was no, we want to fight this government because they're not here for us.

2191
02:09:24.24 --> 02:09:37.24
And that's the, when you pull the string on Vietnam, the South Vietnamese government was just completely corrupt and a lot of the issues that they had were due to the exact same type of corruption, the whole,

2192
02:09:37.24 --> 02:09:55.24
system operated on through corruption and scratching each other's backs and, you know, getting money here and putting in your own pockets and, you know, that was just the way it worked and that was a huge part of the issues that they had and why, it's the exact same thing, it's literally the exact same thing, seeing it again.

2193
02:09:55.24 --> 02:10:10.24
I knew that, you know, you've been, you've been gone to you over there for August September, October, November, December, that's like a deployment, a deployment into a, into a war zone where everything's falling apart.

2194
02:10:10.24 --> 02:10:12.24
What is that?

2195
02:10:12.24 --> 02:10:22.24
That's, I mean, you come in back this time, what, how's it, how's the transition back to reality, back to normal, normal American life?

2196
02:10:22.24 --> 02:10:26.24
It was incredibly difficult, I think, for me to leave this time.

2197
02:10:26.24 --> 02:10:40.24
I felt tremendously guilty about leaving because I knew that I can, as an Australian and an American, I can get, you know, I'm able to get a flight out to Abu Dhabi and, and able to leave freely.

2198
02:10:40.24 --> 02:10:48.24
When that's something obviously a lot of Afghans want, and I felt tremendously guilty because, again, you know, I never think my life is any more valuable than theirs.

2199
02:10:48.24 --> 02:11:00.24
I just happen to be lucky enough to be born in different geographical coordinates that have given me different, different passports and, and, and a very different life.

2200
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:11.24
And, you know, the Afghans are some of the most truly beautiful people, they're just so hospitable, very kind.

2201
02:11:11.24 --> 02:11:21.24
I have a great love for the Afghans, I always say that I've been to many places in the world, but I've never quite sort of fallen in love with the place the way I fall in love with Afghanistan over the years.

2202
02:11:21.24 --> 02:11:26.24
And it's just, it's very special people, and I felt tremendously guilty.

2203
02:11:26.24 --> 02:11:40.24
And, I guess, you know, walking away from them, and I knew that it was time to leave, and I knew that, you know, some of the decisions that I felt that I was making as a journalist were, I was taking risks that I knew were,

2204
02:11:40.24 --> 02:11:44.24
were, were, I shouldn't be taking.

2205
02:11:44.24 --> 02:11:51.24
And I think when you get to that point, when you sort of maybe don't care so much about the outcome, it's time to take a break.

2206
02:11:51.24 --> 02:11:59.24
And that sort of a point that I think that I've gotten to, you know, especially with going into some of the ISIS areas, and even my photographer was hesitating, and I,

2207
02:11:59.24 --> 02:12:15.24
I was okay, well, I'm fine, and I didn't have the same, I think normal reactions you should have to those situations, just, you know, the natural sense of fear or worry, and so anyway, so I knew it was definitely time to take a break with that, but I think,

2208
02:12:15.24 --> 02:12:24.24
yeah, I felt very guilty, especially those first few days, I was just, you know, wanting to turn around and immediately go back.

2209
02:12:24.24 --> 02:12:39.24
That's my first thing, so I couldn't go for a run, and I'm a big runner, and I couldn't go for a run for, you know, five months, and so the first thing I did when I got to New York was go for a run, and I'm running, and I look and I see a sign for a beauty salon on the sidewalk, and I said,

2210
02:12:39.24 --> 02:12:42.24
Oh, they've reopened the beauty salon.

2211
02:12:42.24 --> 02:12:53.24
That was my first instinct, and I thought I hang on a minute to, you know, you're in New York City now, so you're not in Kabul, so, yeah, it's actually, yeah, it's a, it's a strange transition.

2212
02:12:53.24 --> 02:13:01.24
And as I said, when I'm driving down, I'm looking at the roads thinking, how great they are, you know, how great is this road? Why didn't nobody bomb this road?

2213
02:13:01.24 --> 02:13:08.24
And then just remembering, remembering where I am, so it's, yeah, it's a little bit of a transition, but

2214
02:13:08.24 --> 02:13:11.24
And so how long are you going to stay home for?

2215
02:13:11.24 --> 02:13:15.24
I don't, I don't have a home right now, okay? I don't, I don't.

2216
02:13:15.24 --> 02:13:17.24
How long are you going to sleep at places where there's beds?

2217
02:13:17.24 --> 02:13:29.24
I do need to get home. Actually, that is the objective for early 2020, early 2022, scary. I am going to get home, and so I have a good base, so I think, I need to.

2218
02:13:29.24 --> 02:13:36.24
In America? Yes, so I can probably probably be a junior, I think, maybe, I kind of like that area.

2219
02:13:36.24 --> 02:13:45.24
And then what's on the horizon for, you know, what are you going to do for workwise? Are you going to, are you going to, you know, you wrote only cry for the living, which is an incredible book,

2220
02:13:45.24 --> 02:13:56.24
that really gives such clear picture of everything that went on with the ISIS battlefield in the Levant, what are your plans on this stuff?

2221
02:13:56.24 --> 02:14:09.24
So I have, so Jake and my photographer and I have a photo book we're working on, and he's got some really just beautiful pictures of Afghanistan throughout this transition, and then I, I'm going to knuckle down and get the writing for that done.

2222
02:14:09.24 --> 02:14:27.24
Just sort of, a way to present, I guess, Afghanistan to people in a very visual way, you know, just sort of showing people what, what it's like to be there through the fall, and then in that period after, and who the Afghans are, who the Taliban are, who are all these different players.

2223
02:14:27.24 --> 02:14:36.24
So that's the writing project I'm working on, and then just continuing to do journalism and little bits and pieces of different things here and there, so.

2224
02:14:36.24 --> 02:14:54.24
How much writing is going to take to get that book done? Not a huge amount, it's not going to be super word intensive because of the pictures, so probably, and I have so much material already, it's really just a matter of sitting down and and sorting through what I think is going to be the most compelling to go with the pictures that we've already selected.

2225
02:14:54.24 --> 02:14:59.24
So kind of like a humans of New York, but more like humans of Afghanistan.

2226
02:14:59.24 --> 02:15:12.24
Yeah, a little bit, and then sort of go into some of the, some of the decisions and some of the major things that were done and and said and explain things in a way that I hope people can resonate with really.

2227
02:15:12.24 --> 02:15:26.24
Yeah, that'll be that'll be awesome. I mean, I didn't think of that connection until just now like the humans of New York, which is fascinating to look and, and obviously your, your Jake take just just unleashing picture after picture over there.

2228
02:15:26.24 --> 02:15:34.24
And I'm sure he's got incredible full of this and then the context that you can put around those and the history that you can put around them and the knowledge that you have.

2229
02:15:34.24 --> 02:15:36.24
That's, um, there'll be awesome.

2230
02:15:36.24 --> 02:15:47.24
Yeah, so just, yeah, continuing with the writing and then I will return to Afghanistan probably in the spring is my, is my plan at the telebands will help me back. I'm not too mad.

2231
02:15:47.24 --> 02:16:00.24
I just, a lot of this stuff I've written, some of them have been pretty mad. Do they contact you? Sometimes they contact my fixer and, and threatened and I had, I had an issue with one telebands for a long time that just drove me nuts.

2232
02:16:00.24 --> 02:16:02.24
I had a little bit worried about him actually.

2233
02:16:02.24 --> 02:16:08.24
What did you say about he was just very angry about everything and angry and they just just an angry person.

2234
02:16:08.24 --> 02:16:14.24
But eventually I just say, I just say, I don't care. I don't care. Coming get me. I don't care.

2235
02:16:14.24 --> 02:16:24.24
Well, they can't get you here, but maybe, or I thought, should I leave? And they thought, no, I said, come and get me. Tell them to come and get me. Come to the house if he's worried. Come to the house.

2236
02:16:24.24 --> 02:16:39.24
Because he was like, where do you live? I said, come to the house. But anyway, he backed off and went away. But most of them, I think, you know, I think they have a media team that tries to read through, three through reports.

2237
02:16:39.24 --> 02:16:49.24
They're desperate for recognition, so they want, they want attention, but they're increasingly becoming very cracking down on a lot, which in the beginning, though, very open and very free.

2238
02:16:49.24 --> 02:16:55.24
And it was quite easy to get the interviews, but toward the end, it became very difficult to get any approval.

2239
02:16:55.24 --> 02:17:05.24
Well, I don't know. You kind of remind me of Alex Honol, do you know who that is? Alex Honol is the rock climber that climbed L. Cap without any robes.

2240
02:17:05.24 --> 02:17:13.24
And he's, they do like tests on him and there's no, he has, he registers less fear than a normal human.

2241
02:17:13.24 --> 02:17:27.24
And I think you're kind of like that. I think you register less fear than normal human. So, L. Cap is 3000 feet in Yosemite, he straight up ran out and he climbed it with no robes. There's an incredible movie about it called Free Solo.

2242
02:17:27.24 --> 02:17:36.24
But I would, he did that. I remember just thinking, man, I hope that guy never climbs without robes again, and of course he does it all the time. That's the way he is.

2243
02:17:36.24 --> 02:17:45.24
So when you got back, I was kind of like, okay, cool, I hope you never go over there again, but I guess that's like asking Alex Honol not to do what he loves.

2244
02:17:45.24 --> 02:17:56.24
Yeah, I guess, yeah, and I'm very grateful for the fact that I, I just, I feel very compelled and I really do love what I do when I don't, at this point in my life, I can't imagine.

2245
02:17:56.24 --> 02:17:59.24
I don't know what I do.

2246
02:17:59.24 --> 02:18:02.24
Is it just like curiosity?

2247
02:18:02.24 --> 02:18:11.24
It's curiosity. It's just, it's just, it's being, there's rough draft of history that I just think is just a fascinating experience to have.

2248
02:18:11.24 --> 02:18:14.24
And it's something I really thought about a lot.

2249
02:18:14.24 --> 02:18:24.24
You know, you're sitting with all these Taliban and they're bragging about killing Americans and they're bragging about shooting down, you know, American helicopters and they're, you know,

2250
02:18:24.24 --> 02:18:41.24
and I, I really had to reflect on it a little bit because I thought, I mean this situation, you know, what is my job here and and I think what journalists can do is it's, it's not to, you hear the stuff about being a voice and giving people platforms.

2251
02:18:41.24 --> 02:18:53.24
No, that's not how I see my job. I see my job is being able to communicate the other to the people and I say that because we have to understand the way that they think.

2252
02:18:53.24 --> 02:19:05.24
And we want to, it's very easy to paint things as black and white as, as this is the good guy. This is the bad guy, but you have to understand why they do what they do, where this comes from, what their impetus is.

2253
02:19:05.24 --> 02:19:22.24
And that's the way that I sort of see a lot of journalism is not to go in and interrogate or to stick it to them or to, you just have to go in and have a conversation and sometimes that's, I find it to be really difficult because, you know, he's somebody that's, that's, you know, bragging about killing Americans or, or,

2254
02:19:22.24 --> 02:19:31.24
and yet you still have to go in there and have tea and talk to them and it's, it's a balance of sort of this compartmentalization with,

2255
02:19:31.24 --> 02:19:40.24
running from a place a few manatee, but I see that as, that communication is being something that really journalists can do.

2256
02:19:40.24 --> 02:19:45.24
The best because, you know, we aren't government employees, so we don't have to, we can speak to anyone we want.

2257
02:19:45.24 --> 02:19:59.24
And, and I think it's an important job to be able to, to understand, you know, where they're coming from and what that objective is. And, you know, one of them said something interesting, and I'd love to get what your response would be because I didn't have, I just didn't have a response.

2258
02:19:59.24 --> 02:20:06.24
But he looked at me and he said, you know, if, how would you feel if I went to Australia?

2259
02:20:06.24 --> 02:20:13.24
And I started recruiting Australians to kill other Australians. Wouldn't you want to fight me back?

2260
02:20:13.24 --> 02:20:23.24
I thought about it for a really long time and I didn't, I didn't have, I didn't have a great response because, as I said earlier,

2261
02:20:23.24 --> 02:20:30.24
Afghans were not the ones who drove those planes into New York. That was, they were Saudi.

2262
02:20:30.24 --> 02:20:38.24
Osama was found in Pakistan, so we can sort of debate about what role Afghans really even had in the Aztecs.

2263
02:20:38.24 --> 02:20:47.24
And so he, in putting myself in his shoes, you know, I didn't have a great response for, well, how do you respond to that?

2264
02:20:47.24 --> 02:20:59.24
Yeah, well, that's the important thing about what you said earlier, and this is something that we don't do a great job of and by we, I mean, America and West, the West in general, is trying to understand what other people are thinking, right?

2265
02:20:59.24 --> 02:21:10.24
And if you don't understand other people are thinking, as a, I mean, this is what Sun Su said, 2500 years ago in the art of war, you have to understand what you're opponent, what your enemy is thinking.

2266
02:21:10.24 --> 02:21:15.24
If you don't understand what they're thinking, your chances of winning go down dramatically.

2267
02:21:15.24 --> 02:21:25.24
So anytime you try and impose your thoughts on the enemy or you assume that you understand what they're thinking, you're making a huge mistake.

2268
02:21:25.24 --> 02:21:41.24
You're making a huge strategic mistake when you let that happen. So when you talk about what you do as a journalist of saying, okay, let me set my emotions aside and let me listen and let me ask earnest questions about what they're thinking and why they're feeling that way.

2269
02:21:41.24 --> 02:21:54.24
And then you actually listen what they have to say, that is something that people people should do every single day, first of all, as a leader in any organization, as a parent in, in a family, as a child in a family, in a, you know,

2270
02:21:54.24 --> 02:22:06.24
spouse and a relationship in a governmental situation, that's what we should do. That's what you need to learn how to do is try and understand what other people's perspectives are.

2271
02:22:06.24 --> 02:22:17.24
And you can only understand what other people's perspectives are if you ask earnest questions and you actually listen to what they have to say, and you'll probably figure out that what you thought they thought is not accurate.

2272
02:22:17.24 --> 02:22:29.24
So there's a, you know, there's a whole, a whole road to go down with that, but that's something that we don't do very well. And you know, I think journalism nowadays is a whole, it's just a while.

2273
02:22:29.24 --> 02:22:35.24
It's not what it used to be. Certainly, I think you're about as close to an old school journalist.

2274
02:22:35.24 --> 02:22:45.24
I mean, you're, I mean, I know there's others that are like you, but you are in the model of the old school journalist that's out there to gather information and kind of report what's going on.

2275
02:22:45.24 --> 02:22:57.24
And like you said, you know, you're reporting about what the, the new Northern Alliance was, how well they thought and you're like, they, there wasn't much of a fight and people are mad at you.

2276
02:22:57.24 --> 02:23:02.24
Super mad at you because you told what you saw.

2277
02:23:02.24 --> 02:23:07.24
And now, maybe if you were to said there was no fight and I didn't see, you know, there was no fight at all.

2278
02:23:07.24 --> 02:23:20.24
And I don't remember your quotes from that article, but you know, it's like, hey, I didn't see any fighting. I saw, you know, the Taliban moving very dominantly through the area. So you're literally saying what you're saw.

2279
02:23:20.24 --> 02:23:28.24
You're, you're leaving room for you even said today. You said, hey, there might have been more fighting in the mountains that I didn't see, but you're saying from what I saw on these heavily populated areas.

2280
02:23:28.24 --> 02:23:30.24
There wasn't any resistance.

2281
02:23:30.24 --> 02:23:44.24
Or there was very limited resistance. I saw one rocket. That's not a lot of resistance. So I think that that people listening, asking earnest questions is something that the world is forgot how to do.

2282
02:23:44.24 --> 02:23:49.24
Part of it is, I would say the driving factor and that is our own egos to think, well, I know.

2283
02:23:49.24 --> 02:23:57.24
It's like the worst thing to say, the worst thing to say and even an worst thing to think is, I know, I know what you're thinking.

2284
02:23:57.24 --> 02:24:03.24
I know what they're thinking. I know what the enemy is doing. You don't. You don't know. And the minute you think you know is when you start making mistakes.

2285
02:24:03.24 --> 02:24:10.24
So when you start assuming that you understand things and you don't. So I think what you're doing is extremely important.

2286
02:24:10.24 --> 02:24:22.24
I'll still go with the Alex Honel. I actually don't want you to go back to Afghanistan, but I know you're going to be safe and will keep tracking on you.

2287
02:24:22.24 --> 02:24:27.24
Anything. Echo, you got any questions? Yeah, what exactly is the fixer?

2288
02:24:27.24 --> 02:24:32.24
So sorry, a fixer is something that journalists or NGOs even, but primarily journalists.

2289
02:24:32.24 --> 02:24:38.24
When we go into foreign countries, we hire sort of a local person. Sometimes they're a former journalist.

2290
02:24:38.24 --> 02:24:51.24
Sometimes they're just a connected person and they, you know, help. Often will be a translator and they will help sort of help us facilitate interviews and make calls and just kind of work with us.

2291
02:24:51.24 --> 02:25:10.24
Some are sort of like, you know, I ended up calling my fix in a weed, a producer. So essentially he's kind of like producing for us. You know, he's doing a lot of the background and and it was really funny when we went back this time because for the last 20 years all the Afghans and the fixes of being speaking Dari, which is sort of an Afghan dialect of Persian.

2292
02:25:10.24 --> 02:25:24.24
But now it's all pasto. Everything's written in pasto because that's what the, the Taliban's use. So a lot of the people that were, you know, fixing the 20 years are suddenly like, why can't speak the language that's needed.

2293
02:25:24.24 --> 02:25:33.24
So it was a big big transit. A lot of the fixes of all left the country. So it was this very much. We had to find new people to work with. So it was a all the big learning curve.

2294
02:25:33.24 --> 02:25:41.24
So it's kind of like the Las Vegas VIP host. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So it actually, you up with this. Yeah, yeah.

2295
02:25:41.24 --> 02:25:45.24
Echo has like, you know, he's got that different background.

2296
02:25:45.24 --> 02:25:49.24
It was in the nightclub industry for a while. So for him, it's like, oh, that's the VIP host.

2297
02:25:49.24 --> 02:25:53.24
Yeah, I did to in that background. Oh, let me talk to Fred over here. We're taking care of.

2298
02:25:53.24 --> 02:25:59.24
Yeah, so my poor fixer is you know having to talk to the, the dash and all these people on my, he has.

2299
02:25:59.24 --> 02:26:11.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, Holly, we can find you at hollymaka.com. You're on Instagram. Holly S. And it's H-O-L-L-I-E. S.

2300
02:26:11.24 --> 02:26:19.24
M-K. M-K is just MCK-A-Y. You're on Twitter. You're on Facebook. It was crazy to watch you on Instagram when you were over there.

2301
02:26:19.24 --> 02:26:29.24
Um, and see you putting like Instagram live up in your reading like, oh, you're reading people stories like, I look at Echo's story.

2302
02:26:29.24 --> 02:26:35.24
Oh, it's like he's in his kitchen. He's making a freaking sandwich. Oh, I'm, I'm posting that. I just got done working out.

2303
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:41.24
And you're like, I'm in a hotel in Mount Marys, Missouri, or Sharif. And then the most I've ever had ever had.

2304
02:26:41.24 --> 02:26:45.24
I'm out of hand. Yeah. Yeah. Wait a second. This is interesting. So yeah.

2305
02:26:45.24 --> 02:26:49.24
Yeah. And Holly M-K.com. And Holly M-K.com. I think it's the URL for the next.

2306
02:26:49.24 --> 02:26:55.24
Yeah. Okay. So the sub-stack. That's where you're putting your information up. Awesome. Holly. Anything else?

2307
02:26:55.24 --> 02:27:03.24
Thank you for having me. And for letting me talk a talk some more about Afghanistan. I think it's very easy for these things to fall off the news once.

2308
02:27:03.24 --> 02:27:11.24
Once the evacuation happened and it fell off the sort of the rate of very quickly. But I think it's something that's very important to Americans and

2309
02:27:11.24 --> 02:27:19.24
important to, you know, to my generation who really grew up, you know, with often on 11 and so many people that I knew that went to fight there.

2310
02:27:19.24 --> 02:27:25.24
And I think it's important that we keep Afghanistan, you know, somewhere in our minds.

2311
02:27:25.24 --> 02:27:33.24
Hmm. Well, you're certainly helping us to do that. And thank you for coming back to talk to us. And thank you for making it back to talk to us.

2312
02:27:33.24 --> 02:27:43.24
And thanks for letting us know for all you do to go out there and let us know what's actually happening and reporting it so that the world knows what's really happening.

2313
02:27:43.24 --> 02:27:59.24
It's definitely an eerie window into the heart of darkness. And it's a big risk for you to go in there physically, mentally, spiritually, but you're doing meaningful work.

2314
02:27:59.24 --> 02:28:05.24
And it does have a big impact on the world. So thanks for doing it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you.

2315
02:28:05.24 --> 02:28:21.24
Thanks, Holly. And with that, Holly, Mk has left the building. Awesome, that she could stop by and kind of share some of that stuff with us.

2316
02:28:21.24 --> 02:28:28.24
Lots of, lots of craziness in the world. And sometimes it seems like all that's craziness that's going on in the world.

2317
02:28:28.24 --> 02:28:43.24
What are you going to do about it? How can you help it? Look, I don't know what you're going to do for some young girl that's getting no education in Afghanistan right now.

2318
02:28:43.24 --> 02:28:51.24
I'm not sure what you can do about that. I'm not sure. But I do know this. You got a little control over your world. What's going on in your world?

2319
02:28:51.24 --> 02:28:59.24
Trying to make your world a little bit better. That's my recommendation. Man, that's crazy how she mentioned the corruption. You know, like how much of a thought like that.

2320
02:28:59.24 --> 02:29:04.24
I mean, of course, no one's going to be like, yeah, I'm totally down for corruption. No one's going to think that for the most part.

2321
02:29:04.24 --> 02:29:11.24
So, but you don't really understand how important that is to be like legit and square to win that way.

2322
02:29:11.24 --> 02:29:19.24
And I really had no idea what she was going to say when I asked her that question because even, you know, reading through articles and stuff,

2323
02:29:19.24 --> 02:29:32.24
you know, I thought maybe she'd have some strategic thing about the way we treated the trial. You know, just whatever kind of the more common complaints that you'll hear about how Afghanistan was handled.

2324
02:29:32.24 --> 02:29:42.24
And yeah, that was definitely very interesting and insightful aspect to bring up how devastating corruption can be.

2325
02:29:42.24 --> 02:29:52.24
Because then then it's kind of like nothing works the way it's supposed to work. Right. Nothing works the way it's supposed to work when people are corrupt.

2326
02:29:52.24 --> 02:29:55.24
Think about everything. The way things are supposed to be.

2327
02:29:55.24 --> 02:29:56.24
They're not that way.

2328
02:29:56.24 --> 02:30:10.24
Yeah, she said something super quick too. She said super quick, but I was like, oh, that kind of put add the corruption into this this point where she said some of the ISIS fighters joined ISIS, not because they support the ideology.

2329
02:30:10.24 --> 02:30:24.24
It's just because their government is so corrupt and it's like, probably, like the government has so much power over an individual anyway. So if it's like their corrupt and they're just tired of that corruptness and they're like, you know what? I'm going to join this group who sure their stuff is kind of crazy.

2330
02:30:24.24 --> 02:30:32.24
But at least I can fight back and have some power against this this government that I'm powerless against that's corrupt. You know.

2331
02:30:32.24 --> 02:30:43.24
We, we, it's two things going on. We take it for granted in America. That things aren't corrupt and we take it for granted in America. That things aren't corrupt.

2332
02:30:43.24 --> 02:30:50.24
You get my double meaning on this. What I'm saying is we walk around like, oh, you know, well, this American things aren't corrupt here.

2333
02:30:50.24 --> 02:30:57.24
But we take that for granted. There's things that go on inside the government that are absolutely corrupt, absolutely freaking corrupt.

2334
02:30:57.24 --> 02:31:09.24
And the more that stuff grows and also the more exposure it gets because of social media and because the way people can share information and the way you can Google information.

2335
02:31:09.24 --> 02:31:23.24
It's just a different world. And I think that the amount of information that's available is going to start to become a light on a lot of the corruption that's in the US government in the, in now.

2336
02:31:23.24 --> 02:31:33.24
And it's going to get even more so in the future. Yes. Yeah. When you get exposed for being like a whatever some corrupt person like in a position of power.

2337
02:31:33.24 --> 02:31:38.24
There, it seems like there's an element of shame that goes along with it when you get caught.

2338
02:31:38.24 --> 02:31:53.24
Then, then again, I'm no expert in Afghanistan. So I don't know, but it seems like it's just so accepted in certain places, you know. Yeah, well, like look at what just happened with the Cuomo guy from CNN. Why did they get that?

2339
02:31:53.24 --> 02:32:07.24
Well, because he had text going back and forth that wouldn't happen 20 years ago, maybe 20, were we texting 20 years ago? Not too much. The first time I ever texted was.

2340
02:32:07.24 --> 02:32:24.24
We were in Vegas with task unit brewser and lay for and Seth were texting and they started texting me and I'm like, we do it. Just call me or whatever because you're not right. You don't know what's happening.

2341
02:32:24.24 --> 02:32:30.24
I'm like, just freaking call me like, what will send you text we get to wherever and I'm like, this call me. Why are you going to text me?

2342
02:32:30.24 --> 02:32:39.24
And then sure enough, I'm sitting in some bar somewhere in it super loud and get the text. And then just responding.

2343
02:32:39.24 --> 02:32:46.24
Yeah, it's like the other room and the team that what he called T9 word, you know, the one it's not like a phone it's like actually keep people.

2344
02:32:46.24 --> 02:32:49.24
I got to I got to say I had a blackberry.

2345
02:32:49.24 --> 02:32:52.24
When I was the Admos. I got issued a blackberry.

2346
02:32:52.24 --> 02:33:01.24
But that was that. And so then I had the blackberry and once you have a blackberry, it was hard to do anything else because they were freaking a super square to win little rig.

2347
02:33:01.24 --> 02:33:15.24
Even my I got the first iPhone. The very first iPhone that came out stoner went and got in line and got us both iPhones and three days later. You had like a three day return policy. I took it back. Got my blackberry back.

2348
02:33:15.24 --> 02:33:24.24
Blackberry was a square away little rig and then now it gets crushed. Now it gets crushed by it. Well, it's crushed by the iPhone.

2349
02:33:24.24 --> 02:33:27.24
Because they thought they thought they had lock.

2350
02:33:27.24 --> 02:33:31.24
Yeah. They were arrogant. Blackberry was arrogant.

2351
02:33:31.24 --> 02:33:49.24
And it's like, you know, even when you say a text it like texting is so new that we the language didn't even catch out. We just assumed that okay text is now a verb. So now we got to accommodate you know, so because before then text is now now it's an out and a verb.

2352
02:33:49.24 --> 02:33:55.24
So now you need past tense present tense future, you know, all these additional things.

2353
02:33:55.24 --> 02:34:06.24
So here I just say English major either you relate to this kind of stuff. So you're like, oh yeah, he texted me. It's like, is text it a word. Well, I guess it is now what's the past tense for text text.

2354
02:34:06.24 --> 02:34:08.24
Just text.

2355
02:34:08.24 --> 02:34:10.24
He texted me texted.

2356
02:34:10.24 --> 02:34:15.24
And the past did right has just a text and then an ED had texted.

2357
02:34:15.24 --> 02:34:18.24
Yeah, but see how that's like a question kind of text being.

2358
02:34:18.24 --> 02:34:22.24
Yeah, we're not sure. Sounds weird. Text did doesn't sound quite right.

2359
02:34:22.24 --> 02:34:26.24
And we're weird. We're to say, so we got to be careful that.

2360
02:34:26.24 --> 02:34:28.24
Yeah, we do.

2361
02:34:28.24 --> 02:34:31.24
Very careful. So there's corruption out there.

2362
02:34:31.24 --> 02:34:38.24
Yeah, lots of craziness in the world. Like I said, try and make your world as square the ways you can.

2363
02:34:38.24 --> 02:34:40.24
Yeah, how do we do that?

2364
02:34:40.24 --> 02:34:45.24
Well, we have to stay capable to tell you that. Stay capable to healthy.

2365
02:34:45.24 --> 02:34:46.24
How about that?

2366
02:34:46.24 --> 02:34:54.24
You should just go with the first thing in the top of your head that you've utilized say like, hey, I was tired the other day.

2367
02:34:54.24 --> 02:34:58.24
And I went and tried the new freaking pre-workout and it was savage.

2368
02:34:58.24 --> 02:35:01.24
And I ended up jacking big steel.

2369
02:35:01.24 --> 02:35:02.24
Yeah.

2370
02:35:02.24 --> 02:35:09.24
Well, okay. I will, but it's not that story because when I tried it when I took some pre-workout, I tried it long time ago.

2371
02:35:09.24 --> 02:35:11.24
When I took some pre-workout, hey, I wasn't tired.

2372
02:35:11.24 --> 02:35:16.24
I just did it for the mind-body, for the mind-body pre-workout. Okay.

2373
02:35:16.24 --> 02:35:21.24
For the mind-body connection, experience while working out, didn't let me know, full on.

2374
02:35:21.24 --> 02:35:26.24
And it's kind of, and it's different. You can feel the difference like when you don't take it because I don't take it all the time.

2375
02:35:26.24 --> 02:35:29.24
Yeah. So that was my experience recently. That was, did it before yesterday?

2376
02:35:29.24 --> 02:35:37.24
Is there a moment where you say, oh, feeling this certain mode right now, going to jump into, I'm going to get that little extra head right now?

2377
02:35:37.24 --> 02:35:38.24
Yes.

2378
02:35:38.24 --> 02:35:42.24
And what is it, what is it feeling? What have been the feeling that compels that? Yes.

2379
02:35:42.24 --> 02:35:43.24
Yes.

2380
02:35:43.24 --> 02:35:47.24
It's pretty random. It's not what I'm tired though.

2381
02:35:47.24 --> 02:35:51.24
Tariah, because it doesn't have enough caffeine for me to be like, oh, I'm tired of eating to take this.

2382
02:35:51.24 --> 02:35:52.24
So that's too tired.

2383
02:35:52.24 --> 02:35:53.24
Two scoops.

2384
02:35:53.24 --> 02:35:58.24
That's whatever almost 200 milligrams of caffeine. Come on, bro. What are you a crackhead?

2385
02:35:58.24 --> 02:36:00.24
I'm not ready for the two scoops.

2386
02:36:00.24 --> 02:36:01.24
Yeah.

2387
02:36:01.24 --> 02:36:09.24
You're JP at five o'clock in the morning. Yeah. He dry scoops. The new pre-workout.

2388
02:36:09.24 --> 02:36:10.24
Yeah.

2389
02:36:10.24 --> 02:36:13.24
Chased it with sour apple sniper.

2390
02:36:13.24 --> 02:36:14.24
Mm.

2391
02:36:14.24 --> 02:36:17.24
Dry scoops to another one and chase it again.

2392
02:36:17.24 --> 02:36:18.24
Yeah.

2393
02:36:18.24 --> 02:36:24.24
That's little bit beyond beyond my, uh, what is my consumption, uh, capabilities.

2394
02:36:24.24 --> 02:36:25.24
Either way.

2395
02:36:25.24 --> 02:36:27.24
Yes. Pre-workout. I did that.

2396
02:36:27.24 --> 02:36:32.24
I would say the more significant experience is with the energy drinks.

2397
02:36:32.24 --> 02:36:33.24
Mm.

2398
02:36:33.24 --> 02:36:34.24
That's the one.

2399
02:36:34.24 --> 02:36:35.24
That's the one that gets you.

2400
02:36:35.24 --> 02:36:36.24
Yeah.

2401
02:36:36.24 --> 02:36:39.24
And very, very often, like a drink a lot.

2402
02:36:39.24 --> 02:36:40.24
Yeah.

2403
02:36:40.24 --> 02:36:42.24
I'll often you drink them.

2404
02:36:42.24 --> 02:36:44.24
I would say pretty much every day.

2405
02:36:44.24 --> 02:36:45.24
Oh, okay.

2406
02:36:45.24 --> 02:36:46.24
Just one, I'd say every day.

2407
02:36:46.24 --> 02:36:46.24
What's your favorite?

2408
02:36:46.24 --> 02:36:48.24
A mango by far.

2409
02:36:48.24 --> 02:36:49.24
100%.

2410
02:36:49.24 --> 02:36:50.24
By far.

2411
02:36:50.24 --> 02:36:51.24
Do you have anything else on standby?

2412
02:36:51.24 --> 02:36:53.24
Yeah. Kind of the rest of them.

2413
02:36:53.24 --> 02:36:54.24
Okay.

2414
02:36:54.24 --> 02:36:56.24
The citrus that I really drink is much.

2415
02:36:56.24 --> 02:36:57.24
Okay.

2416
02:36:57.24 --> 02:36:59.24
But either way, this is what you do midday.

2417
02:36:59.24 --> 02:37:00.24
Okay. So I wake up.

2418
02:37:00.24 --> 02:37:01.24
I don't really eat breakfast anymore.

2419
02:37:01.24 --> 02:37:02.24
Me neither.

2420
02:37:02.24 --> 02:37:04.24
Yeah. So before lunch, I have one of those.

2421
02:37:04.24 --> 02:37:05.24
That's good.

2422
02:37:05.24 --> 02:37:06.24
That's a good one.

2423
02:37:06.24 --> 02:37:10.24
By one of those, you mean, uh, one of these energy drinks.

2424
02:37:10.24 --> 02:37:11.24
Discipline go.

2425
02:37:11.24 --> 02:37:13.24
Yes. Energy drink healthy energy drinks.

2426
02:37:13.24 --> 02:37:17.24
I really need to reach out to you on the, I'm me utilizing the term energy drink.

2427
02:37:17.24 --> 02:37:18.24
Yeah.

2428
02:37:18.24 --> 02:37:20.24
Did he send a season to say, no, no, no, he liked it.

2429
02:37:20.24 --> 02:37:21.24
Okay.

2430
02:37:21.24 --> 02:37:22.24
Yeah.

2431
02:37:22.24 --> 02:37:22.24
Props to Henry.

2432
02:37:22.24 --> 02:37:23.24
Yes. He says.

2433
02:37:23.24 --> 02:37:28.24
So yeah, energy drinks that are healthy, no sugar, sweet with monk fruit.

2434
02:37:28.24 --> 02:37:29.24
Good for you.

2435
02:37:29.24 --> 02:37:32.24
Healthy or you're better off after you drink them legitimately good for you.

2436
02:37:32.24 --> 02:37:36.24
Yep. You pay no back in a health price with these energy drinks.

2437
02:37:36.24 --> 02:37:37.24
Yeah.

2438
02:37:37.24 --> 02:37:38.24
So yes, one a day is good.

2439
02:37:38.24 --> 02:37:41.24
Here's another front and, uh, investment.

2440
02:37:41.24 --> 02:37:46.24
You can make into your life into your world is get joint warfare.

2441
02:37:46.24 --> 02:37:47.24
Get super krill.

2442
02:37:47.24 --> 02:37:51.24
So that way, you can proactively fight.

2443
02:37:51.24 --> 02:37:54.24
You may have that's your causing to your own joints.

2444
02:37:54.24 --> 02:37:58.24
It's true. You know how like, um, you take things for granted.

2445
02:37:58.24 --> 02:37:59.24
Mm.

2446
02:37:59.24 --> 02:38:05.24
Jensen that and as far as back to my experience, I have been taking my joints for granted.

2447
02:38:05.24 --> 02:38:10.24
Luckily, I haven't, like, had any kind of terrible learning experience to remind me of that.

2448
02:38:10.24 --> 02:38:13.24
I just, every once in a while, like, it's, I get hit with it.

2449
02:38:13.24 --> 02:38:14.24
Like, for how old are I?

2450
02:38:14.24 --> 02:38:17.24
I feel like, I don't have any joint problems.

2451
02:38:17.24 --> 02:38:17.24
Yeah.

2452
02:38:17.24 --> 02:38:19.24
And you got any, you know what you got to do, too?

2453
02:38:19.24 --> 02:38:22.24
You got to continue to do, you got to continue to do the work.

2454
02:38:22.24 --> 02:38:23.24
Yeah.

2455
02:38:23.24 --> 02:38:25.24
Man, you got to, you don't surrender any positions.

2456
02:38:25.24 --> 02:38:26.24
Yeah.

2457
02:38:26.24 --> 02:38:29.24
Don't surrender any positions like your workout positions.

2458
02:38:29.24 --> 02:38:31.24
Like, for me, overhead squat.

2459
02:38:31.24 --> 02:38:32.24
Yeah.

2460
02:38:32.24 --> 02:38:33.24
Over at squat.

2461
02:38:33.24 --> 02:38:34.24
I hurt my arm real bad.

2462
02:38:34.24 --> 02:38:35.24
Remember when Dean Lish.

2463
02:38:35.24 --> 02:38:36.24
Yeah.

2464
02:38:36.24 --> 02:38:37.24
And I could not lock out my arm.

2465
02:38:37.24 --> 02:38:38.24
I could not do an overhead squat.

2466
02:38:38.24 --> 02:38:39.24
It couldn't do it.

2467
02:38:39.24 --> 02:38:40.24
Zero.

2468
02:38:40.24 --> 02:38:43.24
And then finally it started healing.

2469
02:38:43.24 --> 02:38:45.24
And it took months and months and months.

2470
02:38:45.24 --> 02:38:47.24
By the time it was healed,

2471
02:38:47.24 --> 02:38:50.24
my body had kind of forgot how to do an overhead squat.

2472
02:38:50.24 --> 02:38:51.24
Yeah.

2473
02:38:51.24 --> 02:38:55.24
And so the first time I tried to do an overhead squat again,

2474
02:38:55.24 --> 02:38:57.24
my body forgot how to do it.

2475
02:38:57.24 --> 02:38:58.24
And it felt terrible.

2476
02:38:58.24 --> 02:39:01.24
And I couldn't use any weight, like barely any weight.

2477
02:39:01.24 --> 02:39:03.24
I was just using the bar.

2478
02:39:03.24 --> 02:39:06.24
And part of that little ego in the back of my mind,

2479
02:39:06.24 --> 02:39:08.24
the little complacency in the back of my mind,

2480
02:39:08.24 --> 02:39:11.24
was like, you know what, overhead squat's not that big of a deal.

2481
02:39:11.24 --> 02:39:14.24
You should, you know, you don't know what I need to do overhead squat.

2482
02:39:14.24 --> 02:39:19.24
You know, and then I said to myself, no, if you surrender that movement,

2483
02:39:19.24 --> 02:39:22.24
if you don't do that movement, you're,

2484
02:39:22.24 --> 02:39:24.24
it's going to go away forever.

2485
02:39:24.24 --> 02:39:25.24
Yeah.

2486
02:39:25.24 --> 02:39:26.24
So I'm very cognizant that.

2487
02:39:26.24 --> 02:39:29.24
That's why another thing like going deep on squats,

2488
02:39:29.24 --> 02:39:31.24
the minute you're like, well, you know,

2489
02:39:31.24 --> 02:39:32.24
I don't need to go that deep.

2490
02:39:32.24 --> 02:39:33.24
I'm going to go heavy.

2491
02:39:33.24 --> 02:39:34.24
So I'm going to go less deep.

2492
02:39:34.24 --> 02:39:35.24
No, actually don't do that.

2493
02:39:35.24 --> 02:39:35.24
Yeah.

2494
02:39:35.24 --> 02:39:36.24
Okay.

2495
02:39:36.24 --> 02:39:37.24
You want to do that occasionally.

2496
02:39:37.24 --> 02:39:37.24
Okay.

2497
02:39:37.24 --> 02:39:38.24
I get it.

2498
02:39:38.24 --> 02:39:40.24
We're, we're doing muscle confusion.

2499
02:39:40.24 --> 02:39:41.24
Right.

2500
02:39:41.24 --> 02:39:42.24
What?

2501
02:39:42.24 --> 02:39:43.24
Yeah.

2502
02:39:43.24 --> 02:39:45.24
But don't, you got to keep those,

2503
02:39:45.24 --> 02:39:47.24
keep those movements alive, man.

2504
02:39:47.24 --> 02:39:48.24
Keep it alive.

2505
02:39:48.24 --> 02:39:52.24
And now they, that's what reminded me of that deep squats.

2506
02:39:52.24 --> 02:39:55.24
So like, okay, so deep squats, if you, let's say,

2507
02:39:55.24 --> 02:39:57.24
because some people don't have what the ankle,

2508
02:39:57.24 --> 02:40:00.24
like a mobility or for that.

2509
02:40:00.24 --> 02:40:03.24
But if you have the ankle mobility and then you don't do them for a while,

2510
02:40:03.24 --> 02:40:05.24
then trade do them, you'll feel like, oh, wait,

2511
02:40:05.24 --> 02:40:08.24
I got to get my ankle, like mobility kind of back, you know?

2512
02:40:08.24 --> 02:40:10.24
And here's the thing, when you say you lose it forever,

2513
02:40:10.24 --> 02:40:14.24
it's not like, you stop doing it and then it's gone gone.

2514
02:40:14.24 --> 02:40:16.24
You, it's, you stop doing it though when you start doing it,

2515
02:40:16.24 --> 02:40:19.24
it's like, you get it back, but not all of it.

2516
02:40:19.24 --> 02:40:20.24
You did like a little tax.

2517
02:40:20.24 --> 02:40:21.24
That's time to do it.

2518
02:40:21.24 --> 02:40:24.24
And then the longer you wait, the longer my take to get back.

2519
02:40:24.24 --> 02:40:25.24
The bigger the tax to.

2520
02:40:25.24 --> 02:40:28.24
Same with muscle ups when I cut my arm, couldn't do muscle ups.

2521
02:40:28.24 --> 02:40:29.24
Couldn't do it, you know?

2522
02:40:29.24 --> 02:40:31.24
But at the time I started doing muscle ups again,

2523
02:40:31.24 --> 02:40:33.24
I could do one.

2524
02:40:33.24 --> 02:40:33.24
Yeah.

2525
02:40:33.24 --> 02:40:36.24
But it was, it was not fun.

2526
02:40:36.24 --> 02:40:36.24
Yeah.

2527
02:40:36.24 --> 02:40:39.24
And so then I was like, okay, well, today I'm going to do three in my whole work.

2528
02:40:39.24 --> 02:40:41.24
I'm going to do three muscle ups.

2529
02:40:41.24 --> 02:40:42.24
You know what I mean?

2530
02:40:42.24 --> 02:40:43.24
You do the rings?

2531
02:40:43.24 --> 02:40:44.24
Yeah.

2532
02:40:44.24 --> 02:40:45.24
Ring muscle ups.

2533
02:40:45.24 --> 02:40:47.24
So it's one of those things.

2534
02:40:47.24 --> 02:40:48.24
You know what this is?

2535
02:40:48.24 --> 02:40:56.24
This is a little, a little tool to you, you put in your brain to think when you have the moment where you're saying, you know what I'm not going to do this particular exercise today.

2536
02:40:56.24 --> 02:40:59.24
Just remember, you're surrendering that movement.

2537
02:40:59.24 --> 02:41:01.24
And I'm telling you, please don't do it.

2538
02:41:01.24 --> 02:41:02.24
So there you go.

2539
02:41:02.24 --> 02:41:04.24
Don't surrender, don't surrender, don't do it.

2540
02:41:04.24 --> 02:41:05.24
Don't surrender, don't do it.

2541
02:41:05.24 --> 02:41:06.24
Don't take it for granted, either.

2542
02:41:06.24 --> 02:41:07.24
Yeah.

2543
02:41:07.24 --> 02:41:08.24
Take the joint worse, fair.

2544
02:41:08.24 --> 02:41:11.24
Oh, oh, that'll help physically keep your joints in the game.

2545
02:41:11.24 --> 02:41:14.24
That's on top of you keeping it in the sink.

2546
02:41:14.24 --> 02:41:15.24
Moke.

2547
02:41:15.24 --> 02:41:17.24
Moke, you're going to need, let's face, you're going to need to rebuild.

2548
02:41:17.24 --> 02:41:20.24
If you do not know, overhead squats, you're going to need to rebuild.

2549
02:41:20.24 --> 02:41:25.24
So you're going to need some mocks and extra additional protein that just so happens to taste like.

2550
02:41:25.24 --> 02:41:27.24
Two serving.

2551
02:41:27.24 --> 02:41:30.24
But an anachrime pie, if we're going to refer into it, that's the new one.

2552
02:41:30.24 --> 02:41:32.24
But an anachrime bomber.

2553
02:41:32.24 --> 02:41:33.24
Yeah.

2554
02:41:33.24 --> 02:41:34.24
Who thought of that name?

2555
02:41:34.24 --> 02:41:35.24
Maybe.

2556
02:41:35.24 --> 02:41:36.24
Maybe.

2557
02:41:36.24 --> 02:41:39.24
It's good, too. The design is good.

2558
02:41:39.24 --> 02:41:41.24
I was on origin USA, the website.

2559
02:41:41.24 --> 02:41:42.24
Mm-hmm.

2560
02:41:42.24 --> 02:41:44.24
And they got whoever designed that website.

2561
02:41:44.24 --> 02:41:50.24
Pete, I'm just assuming Pete, but well, Pete definitely designed the banana bomber thing.

2562
02:41:50.24 --> 02:41:51.24
Yeah.

2563
02:41:51.24 --> 02:41:52.24
Yeah.

2564
02:41:52.24 --> 02:41:52.24
He's super into the bottom.

2565
02:41:52.24 --> 02:41:53.24
You know, that's good.

2566
02:41:53.24 --> 02:41:54.24
He's good, man.

2567
02:41:54.24 --> 02:41:55.24
He likes it.

2568
02:41:55.24 --> 02:41:56.24
Good design.

2569
02:41:56.24 --> 02:41:59.24
Yeah, we're going to make it a black ball right, but they're on it.

2570
02:41:59.24 --> 02:42:00.24
Yeah.

2571
02:42:00.24 --> 02:42:01.24
He's a bra.

2572
02:42:01.24 --> 02:42:03.24
He sends me objects.

2573
02:42:03.24 --> 02:42:04.24
Yeah.

2574
02:42:04.24 --> 02:42:05.24
We think of this.

2575
02:42:05.24 --> 02:42:06.24
I'm like, bra.

2576
02:42:06.24 --> 02:42:07.24
Right banana.

2577
02:42:07.24 --> 02:42:08.24
So there you go.

2578
02:42:08.24 --> 02:42:09.24
Yeah.

2579
02:42:09.24 --> 02:42:11.24
You like, you bring it back down.

2580
02:42:11.24 --> 02:42:16.24
Like, you know, because if it's, let's face it, dude, if Pete was running, like, had full creases.

2581
02:42:16.24 --> 02:42:17.24
Yeah.

2582
02:42:17.24 --> 02:42:22.24
They'll freaking, the, the mole could come in like a giant banana shaped bottle.

2583
02:42:22.24 --> 02:42:23.24
Oh, yeah. Like he'd get too creative.

2584
02:42:23.24 --> 02:42:24.24
Yeah.

2585
02:42:24.24 --> 02:42:26.24
But then yeah, then you're like the dichotomy and whatever,

2586
02:42:26.24 --> 02:42:27.24
bringing it back down to where it needs to be.

2587
02:42:27.24 --> 02:42:28.24
Perfect.

2588
02:42:28.24 --> 02:42:29.24
It's all perfect.

2589
02:42:29.24 --> 02:42:30.24
My opinion.

2590
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:31.24
So origin USA.

2591
02:42:31.24 --> 02:42:32.24
Or you can say, yeah.

2592
02:42:32.24 --> 02:42:33.24
Merchimade stuff.

2593
02:42:33.24 --> 02:42:34.24
Oh, wait.

2594
02:42:34.24 --> 02:42:36.24
But what about for the drinks, you can get the drinks at wall,

2595
02:42:36.24 --> 02:42:40.24
while, by the way, you can also get everything at the light of

2596
02:42:40.24 --> 02:42:41.24
a shop.

2597
02:42:41.24 --> 02:42:42.24
So check those out.

2598
02:42:42.24 --> 02:42:44.24
And then you were saying origin USA.

2599
02:42:44.24 --> 02:42:45.24
Yes.

2600
02:42:45.24 --> 02:42:46.24
Or genius.

2601
02:42:46.24 --> 02:42:48.24
You're talking about jeans.

2602
02:42:48.24 --> 02:42:49.24
Blossom.

2603
02:42:49.24 --> 02:42:53.24
Everything at origin is made in America.

2604
02:42:53.24 --> 02:42:55.24
Straight up, even the materials are made in America.

2605
02:42:55.24 --> 02:42:59.24
It's an American economic thing.

2606
02:42:59.24 --> 02:43:04.24
The thing.

2607
02:43:04.24 --> 02:43:05.24
What do you call it?

2608
02:43:05.24 --> 02:43:07.24
It's recorded right now.

2609
02:43:07.24 --> 02:43:10.24
No, no, no, no.

2610
02:43:10.24 --> 02:43:11.24
No, no, no, no.

2611
02:43:11.24 --> 02:43:13.24
Painting just if we don't corner it.

2612
02:43:13.24 --> 02:43:14.24
No, we don't have to.

2613
02:43:14.24 --> 02:43:16.24
Because it is a full on American thing.

2614
02:43:16.24 --> 02:43:17.24
It is.

2615
02:43:17.24 --> 02:43:18.24
It's not American thing.

2616
02:43:18.24 --> 02:43:19.24
Yeah.

2617
02:43:19.24 --> 02:43:19.24
All right.

2618
02:43:19.24 --> 02:43:20.24
So, okay.

2619
02:43:20.24 --> 02:43:21.24
So,

2620
02:43:21.24 --> 02:43:25.24
a brain back certain elements of the, of the industry.

2621
02:43:25.24 --> 02:43:27.24
To the point where it's almost,

2622
02:43:27.24 --> 02:43:30.24
it's kind of bringing back and industry.

2623
02:43:30.24 --> 02:43:31.24
Yeah.

2624
02:43:31.24 --> 02:43:32.24
Bring back all elements of the industry.

2625
02:43:32.24 --> 02:43:33.24
Yeah.

2626
02:43:33.24 --> 02:43:34.24
That's what we're doing.

2627
02:43:34.24 --> 02:43:36.24
We can all in one straight up.

2628
02:43:36.24 --> 02:43:37.24
Yeah.

2629
02:43:37.24 --> 02:43:39.24
You can get geese, which you should definitely get some geese,

2630
02:43:39.24 --> 02:43:41.24
which by the way, the geese are not,

2631
02:43:41.24 --> 02:43:44.24
this isn't your father's geek.

2632
02:43:44.24 --> 02:43:45.24
This isn't your mother's geek.

2633
02:43:45.24 --> 02:43:46.24
This is a new deal.

2634
02:43:46.24 --> 02:43:48.24
Those geese are so freaking nice.

2635
02:43:48.24 --> 02:43:50.24
Get yourself one of those geese.

2636
02:43:50.24 --> 02:43:51.24
Sure.

2637
02:43:51.24 --> 02:43:53.24
Also, just kind of FYI,

2638
02:43:53.24 --> 02:43:56.24
we're making some stuff for hunting.

2639
02:43:56.24 --> 02:43:57.24
Yeah.

2640
02:43:57.24 --> 02:43:58.24
We're making a hunting.

2641
02:43:58.24 --> 02:43:59.24
It's not just some stuff.

2642
02:43:59.24 --> 02:44:00.24
We're making a hunting line.

2643
02:44:00.24 --> 02:44:01.24
Yeah.

2644
02:44:01.24 --> 02:44:02.24
Like a bunch of it.

2645
02:44:02.24 --> 02:44:02.24
Yeah.

2646
02:44:02.24 --> 02:44:05.24
So, when you roll out in hunting season,

2647
02:44:05.24 --> 02:44:09.24
you can do it wearing American-made gear.

2648
02:44:09.24 --> 02:44:12.24
We'll keep it posted on that.

2649
02:44:12.24 --> 02:44:13.24
What else?

2650
02:44:13.24 --> 02:44:15.24
Well, you said the boots jeans.

2651
02:44:15.24 --> 02:44:16.24
There's some wallets said.

2652
02:44:16.24 --> 02:44:17.24
Cool accessories on there.

2653
02:44:17.24 --> 02:44:19.24
And I'm wearing accessories.

2654
02:44:19.24 --> 02:44:21.24
I'm telling you, you make it sound like that.

2655
02:44:21.24 --> 02:44:22.24
But like, look at the belt.

2656
02:44:22.24 --> 02:44:23.24
You won't be like,

2657
02:44:23.24 --> 02:44:24.24
The accessories.

2658
02:44:24.24 --> 02:44:25.24
You'll be like, oh, that.

2659
02:44:25.24 --> 02:44:26.24
That belt.

2660
02:44:26.24 --> 02:44:27.24
I'm getting that wallet.

2661
02:44:27.24 --> 02:44:29.24
The wallet's kind of minimalists wallet though.

2662
02:44:29.24 --> 02:44:30.24
So if you're not into minimalists wallets,

2663
02:44:30.24 --> 02:44:32.24
and maybe there's a maximum of,

2664
02:44:32.24 --> 02:44:33.24
there's a maximum of,

2665
02:44:33.24 --> 02:44:34.24
to not maximum.

2666
02:44:34.24 --> 02:44:35.24
But there's a maximum of,

2667
02:44:35.24 --> 02:44:37.24
for robust robots.

2668
02:44:37.24 --> 02:44:38.24
There you go.

2669
02:44:38.24 --> 02:44:39.24
All right.

2670
02:44:39.24 --> 02:44:40.24
They do it with the low-cab coming in hot.

2671
02:44:40.24 --> 02:44:41.24
Just trying to help.

2672
02:44:41.24 --> 02:44:43.24
There's a lot of good stuff on there.

2673
02:44:43.24 --> 02:44:44.24
All made in America.

2674
02:44:44.24 --> 02:44:46.24
And in good quality stuff.

2675
02:44:46.24 --> 02:44:48.24
So it's like, from top to bottom,

2676
02:44:48.24 --> 02:44:50.24
that's kind of the go-to when you think about it.

2677
02:44:50.24 --> 02:44:52.24
So yeah, origin USA.com.

2678
02:44:52.24 --> 02:44:53.24
Also,

2679
02:44:53.24 --> 02:44:55.24
John, did I say jacophil.com?

2680
02:44:55.24 --> 02:44:56.24
I didn't.

2681
02:44:56.24 --> 02:44:57.24
Jacophil.com.

2682
02:44:57.24 --> 02:44:58.24
If you want that,

2683
02:44:58.24 --> 02:44:59.24
the supplement.

2684
02:44:59.24 --> 02:45:00.24
Yeah.

2685
02:45:00.24 --> 02:45:01.24
So the house.

2686
02:45:01.24 --> 02:45:02.24
Just feel that.

2687
02:45:02.24 --> 02:45:03.24
Oh, good.

2688
02:45:03.24 --> 02:45:04.24
Yeah.

2689
02:45:04.24 --> 02:45:05.24
But yeah, jacophil is a story as well.

2690
02:45:05.24 --> 02:45:06.24
That's where you can get disciplining,

2691
02:45:06.24 --> 02:45:07.24
cool freedom stuff.

2692
02:45:07.24 --> 02:45:08.24
shirts.

2693
02:45:08.24 --> 02:45:09.24
Apparel.

2694
02:45:09.24 --> 02:45:10.24
shirts hat.

2695
02:45:10.24 --> 02:45:11.24
Tennis.

2696
02:45:11.24 --> 02:45:12.24
Who these are back in?

2697
02:45:12.24 --> 02:45:13.24
Mm-hmm.

2698
02:45:13.24 --> 02:45:14.24
Twinter.

2699
02:45:14.24 --> 02:45:15.24
Yeah.

2700
02:45:15.24 --> 02:45:17.24
It's kind of colder here.

2701
02:45:17.24 --> 02:45:19.24
And then there's the shirt locker,

2702
02:45:19.24 --> 02:45:21.24
which brief description.

2703
02:45:21.24 --> 02:45:23.24
So the locker, what do you got?

2704
02:45:23.24 --> 02:45:25.24
It is a creative,

2705
02:45:25.24 --> 02:45:28.24
let's just, okay, but on the basic level,

2706
02:45:28.24 --> 02:45:30.24
it's a new shirt every month.

2707
02:45:30.24 --> 02:45:32.24
But the designs are a little bit different,

2708
02:45:32.24 --> 02:45:33.24
a little bit more,

2709
02:45:33.24 --> 02:45:35.24
there are more layers to the designs.

2710
02:45:35.24 --> 02:45:36.24
You know, they're funner.

2711
02:45:36.24 --> 02:45:37.24
I guess.

2712
02:45:37.24 --> 02:45:38.24
Remember when jacophil passed,

2713
02:45:38.24 --> 02:45:40.24
there was a whole thing about like layers.

2714
02:45:40.24 --> 02:45:41.24
Yes.

2715
02:45:41.24 --> 02:45:43.24
There is still a whole thing.

2716
02:45:43.24 --> 02:45:45.24
There's a whole thing about layers.

2717
02:45:45.24 --> 02:45:46.24
Yeah.

2718
02:45:46.24 --> 02:45:48.24
It's almost like it's just a underground.

2719
02:45:48.24 --> 02:45:49.24
It's part of it.

2720
02:45:49.24 --> 02:45:50.24
Yep.

2721
02:45:50.24 --> 02:45:52.24
There's layers in the t-shirts.

2722
02:45:52.24 --> 02:45:53.24
Yep.

2723
02:45:53.24 --> 02:45:55.24
There's more to it than just a straight forward design.

2724
02:45:55.24 --> 02:45:56.24
If you listen, you know.

2725
02:45:56.24 --> 02:45:58.24
If you listen, you know.

2726
02:45:58.24 --> 02:46:00.24
If you're in the game, you know what's up.

2727
02:46:00.24 --> 02:46:01.24
Exactly.

2728
02:46:01.24 --> 02:46:02.24
If you're not, you'll be like,

2729
02:46:02.24 --> 02:46:03.24
oh yeah.

2730
02:46:03.24 --> 02:46:03.24
But if you could do.

2731
02:46:03.24 --> 02:46:04.24
Yeah.

2732
02:46:04.24 --> 02:46:05.24
So that's the whole thing about the layers,

2733
02:46:05.24 --> 02:46:06.24
as far as layers go.

2734
02:46:06.24 --> 02:46:07.24
If you haven't had a game,

2735
02:46:07.24 --> 02:46:09.24
you'll be like, oh man, that's cool.

2736
02:46:09.24 --> 02:46:09.24
Yeah.

2737
02:46:09.24 --> 02:46:11.24
And I get it more cool when every month cool.

2738
02:46:11.24 --> 02:46:12.24
But if you listen,

2739
02:46:12.24 --> 02:46:13.24
and you know,

2740
02:46:13.24 --> 02:46:14.24
you know the other layers in it.

2741
02:46:14.24 --> 02:46:16.24
So now you get the cool design on the front end,

2742
02:46:16.24 --> 02:46:17.24
but then you get the,

2743
02:46:17.24 --> 02:46:18.24
you know,

2744
02:46:18.24 --> 02:46:20.24
you get the cool design on the edge.

2745
02:46:20.24 --> 02:46:21.24
That can't.

2746
02:46:21.24 --> 02:46:22.24
So all good.

2747
02:46:22.24 --> 02:46:22.24

02:46:39.24 --> 02:46:43.24

02:46:43.24 --> 02:46:47.24
Tarenical forces take over.

2762

everyone's going to put some additional stuff on there that turns out to be interesting.

2786
02:47:29.24 --> 02:47:33.24
You're going to see what Jockel can't live without.

2787
02:47:33.24 --> 02:47:35.24
Get that kind of video sometimes.

2788

Jockelpublishing dot com.

2799
02:48:01.24 --> 02:48:05.24
There's actually a book that I published.

2800
02:48:05.24 --> 02:48:06.24
Why?

2801
02:48:06.24 --> 02:48:14.24
Because it's a freaking epic story from somebody that spent time on the battlefield.

2802
02:48:14.24 --> 02:48:18.24
When ISIS was being fought and pushed back.

2803
02:48:18.24 --> 02:48:21.24
And she interviewed people from ISIS, which is crazy.

2804

It's a story.

2808
02:48:30.24 --> 02:48:31.24
It's a novel.

2809
02:48:31.24 --> 02:48:32.24
It's a poem.

2810
02:48:32.24 --> 02:48:33.24
It's a manuscript.

2811
02:48:33.24 --> 02:48:35.24
It's a freaking wild emotional ride.

2812
02:48:35.24 --> 02:48:38.24
Don't read it when you're in front of people because you might be crying.

2813
02:48:38.24 --> 02:48:41.24
Don't read it when you've got to be quiet because you might be laughing.

2814
02:48:41.24 --> 02:48:43.24
Final spin.

2815
02:48:43.24 --> 02:48:44.24

02:48:58.24 --> 02:49:00.24
You want to know what it could this little kid gives you.

02:49:14.24 --> 02:49:18.24
If you got a little kid, get a mic in the dragons.

Little mic in the dragons.

2834

Let him learn to overcome fear.

About face by Colonel David Hacworth.

2838
02:49:28.24 --> 02:49:29.24

But you don't become a good leader overnight.

2855

And you're not just born a good leader.

2856
02:50:17.24 --> 02:50:19.24
Just like you're not born a good guitar player.

2857
02:50:19.24 --> 02:50:20.24
You're not.

2858
02:50:20.24 --> 02:50:21.24
Okay. Who you are.

2859
02:50:21.24 --> 02:50:23.24

That's where you can find her substak as well.

2892
02:51:28.24 --> 02:51:33.24
Where people's on new method of putting information out there.

2893
02:51:33.24 --> 02:51:34.24
The substak.

2894
02:51:34.24 --> 02:51:35.24
Yeah.

2895
02:51:35.24 --> 02:51:38.24
A lot of journalists are using it.

2896
02:51:38.24 --> 02:51:41.24
It's kind of like a patreon.

2897
02:51:41.24 --> 02:51:45.24
But it's not being controlled.

2898
02:51:45.24 --> 02:51:50.24
And they're allowing free speech, which apparently patreon was not substak.

2899
02:51:50.24 --> 02:51:51.24
It's a substak.

2900
02:51:51.24 --> 02:51:52.24
It's cool.

2901
02:51:52.24 --> 02:51:54.24
Finally.

2902
02:51:54.24 --> 02:51:57.24
Thanks to Holly.

2903
02:51:57.24 --> 02:52:00.24
You can hear what she does.

2904
02:52:00.24 --> 02:52:02.24
The rest she takes to inform and educate the world.

2905
02:52:02.24 --> 02:52:05.24
So thank you Holly for doing that.

2906
02:52:05.24 --> 02:52:10.24
People who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.

2907
02:52:10.24 --> 02:52:12.24
And someone has to uncover history.

2908
02:52:12.24 --> 02:52:14.24
I like what she said about history.

2909
02:52:14.24 --> 02:52:15.24
History rough draft.

2910
02:52:15.24 --> 02:52:18.24
The rough draft of history.

2911
02:52:18.24 --> 02:52:21.24
So someone's got to go out and grab that information.

2912
02:52:21.24 --> 02:52:23.24
People like Holly, they go and do that.

2913
02:52:23.24 --> 02:52:27.24
Thank you Holly for your hard work and bravery to make that happen.

2914
02:52:27.24 --> 02:52:30.24
And if people in uniform out there.

2915
02:52:30.24 --> 02:52:37.24
Thank you for doing your best to confront and stop evil in the world and keep us all safe.

2916
02:52:37.24 --> 02:52:42.24
And that includes our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2917
02:52:42.24 --> 02:52:47.24
correctional officers, board of patrol secret service and no first responders.

2918
02:52:47.24 --> 02:52:49.24
Thank you for keeping us safe right here at home.

2919
02:52:49.24 --> 02:52:52.24
And everyone else out there.

2920
02:52:52.24 --> 02:52:55.84
There is evil in the world and there is good.

2921
02:52:55.84 --> 02:53:02.24
And we have to be on guard and we have to be vigilant.

2922
02:53:02.24 --> 02:53:16.24
That's evil.

2923
02:53:16.24 --> 02:53:18.24
So stay vigilant.

2924
02:53:18.24 --> 02:53:19.24
Stay prepared.

2925
02:53:19.24 --> 02:53:20.24
Tell the truth.

2926
02:53:20.24 --> 02:53:23.24
Look out for each other.

2927
02:53:23.24 --> 02:53:26.24
And try and keep your part of the world.

2928
02:53:26.24 --> 02:53:31.24
Try and make your part of the world as good as you can.

2929
02:53:31.24 --> 02:53:35.24
And help other people do the same.

2930
02:53:35.24 --> 02:53:53.24
And until next time, Zekko and Joko out.
