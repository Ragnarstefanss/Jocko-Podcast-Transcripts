[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 320 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
[00:00:08] So there's a a common set of metaphors that get thrown around a decent amount.
[00:00:18] Something along the lines of we as people were authors of our own book and where the star of our own
[00:00:27] movie. You heard these things before? I have. And when you hear them when I just set them and even the way I set them,
[00:00:38] they seem kind of tried and they seem cliched and I guess they are, but like many cliches, they are
[00:00:46] true in many ways. And there's an analogy in those statements with the idea of
[00:00:55] extreme ownership. Take ownership of your life. That's the similar to, hey, you write your own book.
[00:01:08] You get to create the plot is the underlying theme, which means that you have control. And obviously,
[00:01:14] I like that idea. I like that attitude. And I agree with the idea of creating your own plot,
[00:01:24] writing your own book that you're in. But it doesn't quite correlate 100% because
[00:01:35] here's the thing. If you are truly writing your own script, then you actually have control over everything.
[00:01:46] That's happening. You have 100% control over everything that you're writing. You're writing it.
[00:01:52] But in life, in real life, there are things that are beyond your control in war, the enemy gets a vote.
[00:02:03] In life, life gets a vote. Life gets a vote. Bad things are going to happen, the things that you
[00:02:16] don't expect. Disease, accidents, misfortunes, mishaps, catastrophes. And it doesn't matter,
[00:02:26] it doesn't matter who you are or what situation you are in. These things are going to impact your
[00:02:31] life. At some point, no one gets out of life without these things happening.
[00:02:38] No one truly gets to write their own script. So the question is, what do you do with these things when
[00:02:46] they hit you? How do you face these challenges? How do you actually take ownership of your life?
[00:02:54] It is not an easy thing to do. But we are lucky enough today to have someone here that
[00:03:07] has taken ownership of his life and is dedicated his life to service.
[00:03:13] He served in the sealed teams. Once he got out of the sealed teams, created an incredibly
[00:03:20] successful business, he serves his family, serves his wife and his two daughters. He serves his
[00:03:26] faith. And now he is looking to serve his country again as a political leader. His name is Eli
[00:03:37] Crane and he is here tonight to share his experiences and pass on some of those lessons learned
[00:03:45] that he got along the way. Eli Crane, thanks for coming down, man. Thanks for having me, Jaco.
[00:03:52] Appreciate it. Long drive out from Arizona. I know about five and a half hours, but it was a good one.
[00:03:59] Let's jump into this. So speaking of Arizona, let's start at the beginning. Let's start about your
[00:04:03] past and where you came from. Yeah, I actually was born in Tucson, Arizona. My dad was going to
[00:04:11] pharmacy school out there. Both my parents are from Iowa and they moved out here. Go to a good
[00:04:18] pharmacy school and there were a lot of pharmacy jobs in the west. So my dad went through pharmacy
[00:04:23] school and moved to Stown to Yuma, Arizona, of all places. Yeah. And so was there a job or something
[00:04:30] down there? That's why that's why I did it. And it's cool because I remember a lot of my buddies
[00:04:36] in the platoon were always complaining about Iraq and I was like, this is like where I'm from.
[00:04:42] Man, except Arabic street signs and maybe an extra dust storm here there. This is like,
[00:04:47] kind of like Yuma without the good Mexican food. But yeah, so grew up in grew up in Yuma and
[00:04:55] just love playing sports was a football player. Played a little bit of basketball and stuff like
[00:05:01] that wanted to be a pro football player but then I realized you know, ran into reality and realized
[00:05:07] that I didn't have the skills and started looking at other options. Was your, Sir, your dad was
[00:05:14] actually completed pharmacy school and he was a pharmacist? Yes sir. And what about your mom?
[00:05:17] Was she doing the same thing or did you start raising the kids or? Yeah, she was raising the kids and
[00:05:23] she was also, she also did some part-time work at our church as a secretary. So.
[00:05:27] So you were spending time in church then when you were younger? Yeah, I did. How was the attention
[00:05:36] span in school and whatnot? It was good student? No, it was a horrible state. It was funny. I remember,
[00:05:43] thank God, you know, Jaco, you talk about dynamic leadership sometimes are like hey,
[00:05:48] what works for this individual doesn't work for that individual. But it was interesting because I
[00:05:55] remember my mom, thank God, she, you know, tried to be dynamic and parenting me and my brothers
[00:05:59] because my older brother and younger brother were good students but me on the other hand, not so much.
[00:06:05] We either, you're the middle, right? I was a middle and they were, I remember my mom come and home
[00:06:09] from a parent teacher conference and she was like, you know, Ela has in the classroom but he's
[00:06:16] not really here and like I was always daydreaming. I was out at recess, Jason Butterfly's
[00:06:22] whatever I was doing. But yeah, it didn't, and it was interesting because as I went down that
[00:06:28] pipeline, you know, I started to think, you know, people would tell me, like, especially my brothers,
[00:06:33] you know, you always raise your brothers, give each other hard time and my brothers, you know,
[00:06:38] I probably dished out more than I, than I received, but you know, they would tell me that I was stupid
[00:06:46] because my grades were awful. And so you hear, you hear something enough time, your stupid, your
[00:06:51] stupid, your stupid, you start to internalize it and, you know, you can easily make that a part of
[00:06:56] your identity. So I did, and, you know, I started to think I was stupid. And then as I got,
[00:07:02] as I got further along in life and I started, you know, finding what I was passionate about.
[00:07:08] I realized that I wasn't stupid. I just, you know, needed to have that energy and my attention
[00:07:14] funneled in the right direction towards something that I really cared about. So you played,
[00:07:19] did football, did you say football and what? You know, I played football a little bit of basketball,
[00:07:25] but most of my focus was football. Yeah, and you played all through high school? Yeah. How good were
[00:07:30] you? You know, I was decent, but I wasn't, I wasn't good enough to move on to college. I played,
[00:07:38] you know, I played quarterback. I loved, you know, playing quarterback. I loved the team dynamics of
[00:07:44] football, but it was interesting. And, you know, I got to take extreme ownership of this, but my coach,
[00:07:52] we had like three slow white quarterbacks and in high school, our coaches decided to switch us to an
[00:07:58] option, you know, running football team. So it was kind of like, you know, none of us were even
[00:08:04] really in a system that, you know, really highlighted our skills, our preferred skill sets or what
[00:08:11] we were even good at. But, um, and there was, there was one guy that ended up starting over me.
[00:08:18] And, uh, unfortunately, he was juicing at the time. And I was like a scrawny, like hundreds, you know,
[00:08:24] I wasn't that fortunate for him. He was like, I was six one, like 170 pounds, just really,
[00:08:31] really scrawny. He hadn't put on any weight yet. And, uh, he had, he kept throw about 15 yards
[00:08:36] further than me. And he, he got, he, he started. So it is what it is, didn't get, you know, didn't,
[00:08:42] didn't get the opportunity to really start once I got deeper. I started all the way up to
[00:08:47] like my junior year and then, you know, I got benched. And, um, the bottom line is, you know,
[00:08:52] I wasn't good enough to make it happen. And I'm kind of looking back on it, hindsight being what it is.
[00:08:57] I'm kind of glad because I'm pretty pretty thrilled about the route that I ended up going down.
[00:09:02] And then you, you stayed in Yuma, that where you went to high school?
[00:09:08] Yeah, that's where I went to high school, civil high school.
[00:09:11] And your parents were just continuing to work and, yeah, get you ready for life?
[00:09:18] Yep, pretty much just raising me and my two brothers and, um, yeah, I mean, you know,
[00:09:25] I'm, feel pretty fortunate to grow up in the home that I did, you know, my parents loved us,
[00:09:29] they provided for us, et cetera. And, um, you know, I, I realized a lot of folks don't get that.
[00:09:36] So, pretty grateful for that. And then were you planning to go to college?
[00:09:41] Was that part of your plan?
[00:09:42] Yeah, I, I was planning to go to college, but I was hoping that I could go there and play football.
[00:09:47] Like that was my focus, that was my goal. And, uh, and then I also wanted to be in the military at some point.
[00:09:55] And so the advice that I was getting was, hey, if you're going to go to college, you know,
[00:10:00] or if you're going to go into the military, go through, go through school, get your degree,
[00:10:04] become an officer, you know, and you'll get a lead man, the pays better, et cetera.
[00:10:09] And, you know, that wasn't the path I ended up taking, but, um, did you, did you get better grades?
[00:10:16] Did you got older or did you did your brother scar you to the point where you heard to the,
[00:10:22] not doing any school or you at all? No, so when I got out of, uh, when I got out of high school,
[00:10:28] I started working some like odd jobs like construction, you know, at one point I was like a
[00:10:33] scorekeeper down at Parks and Rec, you know, for like softball games, stuff like that.
[00:10:38] I was working at a restaurant as like a bus boy, you know, definitely not on the, on the path to
[00:10:43] this. This is when you got out of high school. Yeah, when I got out of high school,
[00:10:46] did you didn't go right into college? I didn't. Okay. And then, uh, and then,
[00:10:51] I was kind of, I was kind of lost and it was right after my parents divorced, and my parents
[00:10:55] divorced was pretty tough. And so it kind of rocked my world. I was definitely, you know, a little bit
[00:11:00] rattled. So I was trying to figure how old were your parents got divorced? I was 17. So, um, you know,
[00:11:07] thankfully, like I said, I got my parents together for most of my, you know, upbringing, but it was,
[00:11:13] it was a pretty brutal divorce. And so it just really rocked my world and, um, I was, you know,
[00:11:18] took some time trying to figure out who the hell I was, what I was going to do. And, um, and then I started,
[00:11:25] I, I started going back to a community college called Arizona Western, and I started studying
[00:11:31] criminology. And that's when I started getting good grades because I, I loved it and, I loved it.
[00:11:36] And, you know, I was, I wasn't getting straight as, but I think, I had like a three, three, five
[00:11:41] average or something like that. And, uh, you know, I enjoyed it. And I longed that last four.
[00:11:47] So I did that for about two years. I think I was one credit away, like a, a elective away from getting my,
[00:11:55] my associate's degree. And then I applied to go to the University of Arizona.
[00:11:59] Unfortunately, when I got to the University of Arizona, they didn't have like a criminology degree.
[00:12:04] They had like a, some criminal justice degree, but I'd have to go to the L. or Business School,
[00:12:10] and I didn't get into that one. You had to have really good grades to get into it.
[00:12:14] And, uh, and so I ended up being like, okay, I still want to finish my degree. Still
[00:12:20] want to have the opportunity to become an officer if possible. And so I was like, okay,
[00:12:25] being the typical, you know, I was like, okay, what's what path can I go that allows me to do that?
[00:12:32] And so I looked at sociology, the study of society and culture. And I started, uh,
[00:12:38] you know, working on my major and that I switched my major at that point because it's because they
[00:12:43] didn't have the criminology major. Were you thinking about the seal teams or were you just
[00:12:48] thinking about the military in general? Did you know? Yeah. So at that point, I knew I wanted to be a seal.
[00:12:55] Even when I was back in UMB before I came to Tucson, I was never a big part of your or anything
[00:13:00] like that. And I remember, um, when I was even when I was doing the odd jobs, one of my favorite
[00:13:05] things to do at night was to go to Barnes and Noble and just like, you know, really go through
[00:13:11] the military history section that they have there. And I would just read books on special forces,
[00:13:17] PJs, Rangers, Delta. And I just fascinated by the special forces community. And I remember my dad
[00:13:25] gave me a piece of advice in high school. He said, Eli, the trick to being happy in your career is
[00:13:30] basically to pick something you would do for free. Don't, don't pick a career because of money.
[00:13:36] It won't make you happy. And he told me, if I could, if I could go back and do it again, I wouldn't
[00:13:41] be a pharmacist. He said, I could have gone and, you know, you know, been a forest Ranger,
[00:13:46] something like that. I would, I would do that. And so I took that advice on board. And I was like,
[00:13:50] you know, man, I was reading the books. And I was like jumping out of airplanes, blowing stuff up,
[00:13:55] you know, shooting, you know, being with, you know, being in a team environment.
[00:13:59] Puedo, I do that for free for sure. And so I started setting my mind on special forces. Is there
[00:14:06] something that particularly narrowed it down to the seal teams? Yeah, because all the literature that I was
[00:14:12] almost almost all of it said that it was the toughest training in the department of defense.
[00:14:18] And I don't know. There was something about that that just appealed to me. Like, I wanted to test
[00:14:22] myself and see if I could, if I had what it took to, to make it through the toughest training in the
[00:14:28] world. And then I, I loved the water or I thought I did. Yeah. That, that, that, that notion gets tested.
[00:14:37] Yeah, those get tested. It picked up. How old were you when you were figuring all that out?
[00:14:41] Was that when you're already at the University of Arizona? Yeah. So it was even when I was, you know,
[00:14:48] definitely thinking about it, even when I was at Arizona Western, I was also thinking about
[00:14:52] what it'd be cool to be a fed, because I was studying criminology, you know, federal law enforcement,
[00:14:57] or something like that. And then as soon as I got to U of A, you know, I started studying
[00:15:03] sociology, which I really, I was back in that, I really don't like this that much. And I really,
[00:15:10] I could even see kind of the indoctrination within academia at that point. And I was like,
[00:15:16] I'm really not on board with a lot of this extra curricular stuff that they're putting out here
[00:15:20] and kind of the bent that a lot of academia has. And so I started, I found a program in ROTC.
[00:15:30] I started, I realized, okay, there is an ROTC program here. There's a lot of military folks.
[00:15:34] Maybe I should go get hooked into that. And so I did. And I found that they had a Ranger Challenge
[00:15:41] program at U of A. And so I was like, oh, cool, man, I want to see if I can join and get into that.
[00:15:46] Maybe I could learn a little bit and, you know, network and just figure out, start working towards
[00:15:52] getting in the right type of shape. And so I started doing the Ranger Challenge program and,
[00:15:57] you know, we'd have to, you know, wake up, do early morning PT's and, you know, just get some
[00:16:02] exposure to that culture and the leaders within that culture. And so I started doing that.
[00:16:08] And that was helpful. So what year is this? So that would have been probably
[00:16:12] 2000. So were you in college? You know, in September 11th came? I was. I was. I was just starting my
[00:16:22] senior year at the U of A. And I was doing that Ranger Challenge program. You know, my grades were
[00:16:27] decent. I was a lifeguard at the U of A. Rex Center and, and 9 11 happened. I just finished a
[00:16:35] Ranger Challenge workout early in the morning. Got my car turned on the radio and I was driving
[00:16:41] back to where I lived and it was all over the radio and I was like damn. I was actually in a
[00:16:46] agricultural fraternity called Alpha Gamma Roe at the time. So I drove home and I was like, I woke up
[00:16:52] all the guys who were still asleep and I was like, dude, you guys got to get out here and watch this.
[00:16:56] And so we all, we all got to watch it and everybody was just obviously stunned and surprised and
[00:17:02] pissed off at the same time. And so I remember wanting to join, you know, obviously I, I wanted to
[00:17:10] join the military and I remember, you know, taking a couple days to think about it, but I'm just like,
[00:17:16] I got to go, you know, and I remember calling my mom and my dad and telling him, hey, look, I've
[00:17:22] decided I'm going to go join the military. I'm going to drop out of school and join the military.
[00:17:26] Because I just really felt like, hey, there's never going to be a time like this, you know,
[00:17:31] where the nation needs the next crop to step up and serve. And so I actually dropped out that
[00:17:38] week when, you know, dropped out all my classes and then went down, started talking to the recruiter
[00:17:44] and playing those games with the recruiter. And then, with then probably, I think, seven or eight
[00:17:49] days, I was, we were driving up to Phoenix so that I could get on a plane and fly to Great Lakes and
[00:17:55] it was pretty quick. Dude, that's really quick. Yep. And was it like a Seal contract? Was it,
[00:18:02] what was it a Seal contract? Yeah. Was it called Diver? I don't think it. I don't think it.
[00:18:07] I did back in 1820. No, it wasn't called that. I can't remember what it was called, but they did
[00:18:17] guarantee me the opportunity to do a screen test and try out. Yeah, which is if you think about that,
[00:18:24] is the shallowest guarantee you could ever get to sign your life away. Right. Hey, here you
[00:18:30] sign this piece of paper for six years in the Navy and you will be guaranteed a chance to take a
[00:18:38] street, screening test that might get you picked up for buds. Right. That's a slim offering.
[00:18:43] I know it. And you Rogered up. I did. I did. And, you know, I'm, I wouldn't look
[00:18:50] in back on it now. I don't think I would change it. Even though I never, I've still to this day,
[00:18:56] never finish my degree, you know, for a couple different reasons. But I think this, I think it was the
[00:19:03] right thing to do. And I'm glad that, you know, there were a lot, there were thousands of Americans that
[00:19:08] did do exactly that. Yeah, Tim Kennedy was saying that same thing. He went down to the recruiter
[00:19:12] like September 12th or whatever. Yep. And he said the line was around the building and everything.
[00:19:18] So you showed up to boot camp in Chicago? Yep. And was it, was it a shock to the system?
[00:19:25] Well, big time. Big time. Yeah. I don't know who doesn't get a shock when he showed the boot camp.
[00:19:32] Even Navy boot camp, which is, you know, relatively mild, I guess compared to, like, let's say,
[00:19:40] the Marine Corps boot camp. But just the immediate loss of all your personal freedom,
[00:19:46] right, personal space, it's kind of a, it's kind of a little bit of a shocker echo.
[00:19:51] Oh, I understand. And what were you going to be? So I, uh, back then, I mean, obviously your goal
[00:19:58] is to be a seal, but you had to take a rate, right? Yep. What, uh, Gunners Mate was a seal source
[00:20:04] rate at the time. I think they're only at five o'clock. So I mean, I was like Gunners Mate. Yeah,
[00:20:08] cool. That sounds awesome. So I, so I chose Gunners Mate. And, uh, thankfully, I chose a cool one,
[00:20:14] because I was going to spend some time in that rate. Yeah. Did you take the screening test?
[00:20:19] I did. You passed it? Not the first time. The second time. Yeah, man. This, you know, this is something
[00:20:28] even before. Or older you at this point? I am 20. I'm 21 years old. Okay. So, um, I didn't pass my
[00:20:37] first one. I passed, I passed the second one. Like I was running in like steel, the, you know,
[00:20:42] back when you had to run the screen test and like steel, towed boots, knee knockers. Yeah. And I had
[00:20:48] gotten some, what I would consider today probably some pretty bad gouge from a team guy, um,
[00:20:53] that I talked to because I didn't know any seals. And I, you know, but my recruiter, he was like,
[00:20:58] hey, man, there's some seals out at YPG. You'm approving around her at jump school. We can go talk
[00:21:03] to him if you want. And I was like, yes, I'd love to go talk to him. So I remember going out,
[00:21:07] he drove me out there and I talked to one. And, uh, he was like, he's like, look, man,
[00:21:13] the only way you're going to know is if you, if you have what it takes, it's just a show up and
[00:21:17] do it. He's like, can you pass the screen test? And I was like, yeah, I think I can't. And so,
[00:21:23] that is, that is the worst advice ever. So that's what I was rolling on. Like this guy is a
[00:21:28] Navy seal dude. This is what he told me. So, um, and then, so I, you know, once I got to the level
[00:21:33] where, you know, I could do like, I could pass the screen test. I was like, okay, I'm good to go.
[00:21:38] Let's do it. And then when I got, like, I was, but even when I ran the screen test on my own,
[00:21:44] I was never running in and still towed boots and pants and I don't, and like a fool,
[00:21:51] when I did, when I did this stuff, I didn't, I didn't do it together. And that's a big deal.
[00:21:55] There are a lot of people don't, like, people don't, yeah, dude, I can do 42 pushups. Yeah, I can do
[00:22:01] I can do six pull-ups. I can, I can do all these things individually, but you're not running
[00:22:06] them together. And when you start running them together with, with the time, um, requirements in
[00:22:11] between, it'll gas you pretty quick. So, the first time I ran it, man, I was dry heaving,
[00:22:18] coming across the finish line and, uh, failed. But I got a chance to go back and do it again.
[00:22:23] The next time, like, I came in with, like, maybe a second left. And, uh, they're like, all right,
[00:22:29] sweet, you get your silk contract, and I'm like, yes. And so, um, graduated from boot camp,
[00:22:35] went to Gunners made a school right there in Great Lakes. And at that point, they let us work
[00:22:41] out with some actual seals. We got to do CLPT, I think three times a week. So I started doing that.
[00:22:46] And it was kind of funny. I had, I have hairy legs. And so, there was this instructor.
[00:22:51] You would Joe Biden apparently. Wow. Wow. He's, I didn't realize. You see that video, right?
[00:23:00] I mean, is there a crazier, like, no combination of randomness that you could put into a video
[00:23:06] besides that Joe Biden and hairy legs and the kids in the blonde hair and the white. The most
[00:23:12] insane thing. Yeah, so anyways. So you got hairy legs. Yeah. And so one of the instructors,
[00:23:19] the name was instructor hater. He, he wouldn't even let me speak English. He made me speak in
[00:23:24] bookie. Like, and I used to be real good at doing the truth. But it was like, no, like, he made me
[00:23:30] run around and like, you know, go report to so and so over there. I would run up to him and I,
[00:23:35] he'd make me report like that and it, they loved it. But whatever. And yeah, so did the CLPT
[00:23:42] thing graduate graduated, Gunners made a school and then went immediately to Buds in class
[00:23:49] up with Buds class 242. Would you get what you expected at Buds? Yeah, and more and more. And,
[00:23:58] you know, it was, it was really, it was really interesting because I actually made it through
[00:24:06] how weak on my first, on my first attempt. And, you know, definitely not heroic, more like hanging
[00:24:13] on by the, you know, hanging on. What would you have a trouble with? So, yeah, yeah, I was, I was
[00:24:22] having trouble with Buds. So, when I was born, I was born with some doctor say that I had asthma,
[00:24:29] some said I had exercising due sprungitis, whichever diagnosis is correct at the end of the day,
[00:24:35] my lungs only functioned at about 60 percent and that, you know, of what they're supposed to. And that's
[00:24:40] after even like an albuterahit or treatment. And so, you know, you can imagine, you know, if your lungs
[00:24:47] are only functioning at 60 percent and you've trained to the bare minimum, you're going to have
[00:24:52] a tough time. And so, I was having a really tough time. And so, I made it, and I, I walk around
[00:25:00] it about 225 pounds. I had because my lungs don't function at the level they're supposed to,
[00:25:07] I had to get down to a hundred and seventy five pounds just the past of screen tests, right?
[00:25:13] It's like a car, right? We can't put a bigger engine in this thing, you know, we can't do a lot to it.
[00:25:18] How how do we make it? We start stripping weight out of it, throw the back seat, you know,
[00:25:22] like get rid of weight. Because just saying it is only going to go as fast as it goes. And so,
[00:25:27] started really, you know, getting really thin, really thin, and that, that, this is while you're in Buds
[00:25:33] or I had to get, I had to get really thin before you can go into Buds just because, you know,
[00:25:37] was this while you were at GMA school? Yeah. So while you're GMA school, you're just dropping weight.
[00:25:42] Yep. Trying to get, trying to get the run faster. Yep. And you show up at Buds
[00:25:47] in your herd. Yeah, and it wasn't, honestly, it wasn't just that. It wasn't just that. Like,
[00:25:52] I was immature as well. You know, I had, that's one thing that, like, when I talked to people about
[00:26:00] seal training in Buds and the fact that they're trying to form you into a team guy,
[00:26:07] when I first showed up, I was immature and I was like, I was looking out for number one. I was
[00:26:11] looking out for me. I was like, man, and it wasn't like I was a jerk, but if, if I'm struggling,
[00:26:18] if I'm on the struggle bus over here, and I haven't grown up in maturity yet, I'm like, man,
[00:26:23] I got to, I gotta focus on myself. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna volunteer for that to spot
[00:26:28] under the boat, man. I'm hurting, right? And so, after post-heal week, I failed a,
[00:26:36] evolution called life saving, which sometimes is a passer fail, sometimes it's a weed out
[00:26:40] evolution. And so life saving just for people to understand, this is where the students have to
[00:26:48] rescue the instructors who are allegedly drowning, and they're actually not drowning. They're actually
[00:26:54] just getting ready to kick your ass. So, and they have different levels. The first one is kind of
[00:27:00] passive, and then it goes up those to the fifth level, which is you're in a fight with another
[00:27:06] dude in the water. And you mentioned that it's past fail, but you also mentioned that there's a decent
[00:27:15] amount of subjectivity to it, where if you have a guy that's coming through buds that maybe he's
[00:27:20] meeting the standards, he might even be crushing the standards, but he's not a good, doesn't appear
[00:27:26] like he's gonna be a good teammate. Doesn't it? Doesn't appear to be the kind of guy you'd want
[00:27:30] your platoon as an instructor? Yep. They can weed that guy out. Yep, at least that's the way it used to be.
[00:27:37] Yep. And that's what it was. And it's, I'm glad. I, you know, I look back on it. It's one of the
[00:27:44] best things that ever happened to me. You know, I got, I failed that event. They gave you like in most
[00:27:50] evolutions of buzz. It'll give you like two or three chances to pass it. I failed it three times.
[00:27:54] So they sent me to an academic review board. When you were, when you were failing that,
[00:27:59] was that just like horrifying? I can only imagine that failing life saving would be, yeah,
[00:28:06] kind of like drowning. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it was horrifying. Like I remember,
[00:28:13] we had one instructor who was a very large man, very large man. I remember getting him back to the
[00:28:18] pool wall, pinning his hands on the side and I was just smoked. And I got up on the pool deck and I'm
[00:28:24] still holding his hands on the pool wall so that, you know, he doesn't, because he'll just, he'll just
[00:28:29] fall into the pool if you don't, if you don't pin him to the wall. And so I'm pin him to the wall. I get up.
[00:28:36] I get out of the pool deck and like I'm supposed to like cross his hands as I bring him up. You know,
[00:28:41] you don't want to talk about it. So he can like spin the other way. So he can spin with his back
[00:28:45] towards me and then I can put him put him on my legs and slowly let him down. So if he was a
[00:28:51] real drowning victim, I'm not creating more trauma. And I remember I spun him the wrong way and
[00:28:56] his junk like landing right on the pool deck and I heard him go, and this, he was his biggest
[00:29:02] doctor and I'm like 170 pound bud student. On my third try and I'm like, oh my god, I'm done.
[00:29:10] And went to an academic review board and yeah, they were, I remember walking in and they were like,
[00:29:17] all right young man, we're looked over your record and this is post-held week. This is post-held
[00:29:21] week. Meet yeah, me and my roommate were both dead. I think we both got boarded that day with one
[00:29:28] other guy and they were like, look, you're obviously tough. You made it through how weak, but we need the
[00:29:35] best of the best here and you're not meeting up to that standard. They were like, you fell to run,
[00:29:40] you fell to swim, you fell to no course and here is the big, here is the big one and you're
[00:29:46] at you're ranked in the bottom 25% of your class because in sealed training even back then we were
[00:29:51] doing peer e-vails. And so that's a big deal. And so they're like, we're going to recommend that
[00:29:56] you come back in a year and I was like, okay. And so you know, that was a tough, tough blow for
[00:30:03] me because they actually ended up keeping my roommate who had basically the same stats that I had
[00:30:08] was ranked the same the same way. So that was the keypim, you know. Honestly, I don't know,
[00:30:13] but they didn't tell me, but he actually made it all the way to third phase, couldn't pass this final
[00:30:21] swim and he got, he got booted and he was a, he was a little dude as well, but I felt really bad for him
[00:30:29] because he never went back. When you were going through hell week, what, were you solid and how
[00:30:35] week in terms of mentally? You know, I would say, I wouldn't say solid, I would say my mentality was
[00:30:44] hanging on for dear life. And I think that was, you know, the difference between my first
[00:30:49] how weak and my second how weak. If I say hanging on for dear life, you mean you're sitting in the
[00:30:55] water on Tuesday night and you're like, like, can we get a little bit further and you just did that
[00:31:02] the whole time, basically? Yeah. So the interesting thing is, is that I never thought about quitting.
[00:31:10] However, I remember we broke out Sunday night and then Monday night, I remember standing in line
[00:31:18] with, you know, the class, you know, where they're coming around with flashlights looking at you
[00:31:23] and I'm thinking of myself. I've never been this cold. I've never been this wet. Never been this tired.
[00:31:28] This is not Monday night. This 24 hours in and I've still got another four and a half days of this.
[00:31:34] No, and I'm certain I think of myself. There's no way. And what I was trying to do is, I was trying
[00:31:40] to eat that elephant in, you know, in one bite. And I mean, that's, I think that's probably the
[00:31:46] thing that gets most guys in training is that like when you've got a five and a half day block
[00:31:52] like that and you try and eat it in one bite, it's just mentally overwhelming. No, but if you're able
[00:31:58] to break it up into, I'm not even going to worry about Friday afternoon. I'm just going to focus
[00:32:02] on, I know I get to eat chow in two hours. I'm just going to, I'm going to make it to chow. And if it
[00:32:07] gets tougher than that, I'm just going to make it through this race. And if it gets tougher than
[00:32:11] that, I'm just going to put my right foot in front of my left foot and from, and you just break
[00:32:15] those goals down. And that, that was something that you, you think you're decent at doing until
[00:32:21] you get into the eye of that storm and you're like, that was a big difference between how we
[00:32:27] go on and how we do for me. But I, I bottom line is extreme ownership. I got what I deserved
[00:32:34] and it ended up being a blessing. How, were you not just super freaking angry when you got dropped?
[00:32:42] I was, I was, I remember, you know, you probably know, uh, Dan Taver. So I remember talking to
[00:32:50] instructor Taver at the time. He was, he was there in my board. He was the proctor in my class.
[00:32:56] And, you know, he pulled me aside. And it was really cool because he didn't have to do this. But
[00:33:00] he was just really encouraging. He was like, hey, don't, don't let this, he said something in
[00:33:04] effect. I don't let this be the end. Come back. Do it. You can make it. And he's like, and he's like,
[00:33:11] and don't, basically, he's like, um, don't feel bad about this. Just make it right. And that was
[00:33:18] really cool coming from a guy like that. Who at that point in my life, I don't even know if, you know,
[00:33:22] he, you know, cared about it. Because, you know, the persona that buzz instructors put on. But it was
[00:33:27] just really cool. It was like, it was like an older dude who'd been there done that, sealed chief,
[00:33:32] and just a mentorship moment. And that that was really cool that he did that.
[00:33:36] So then it's trick or treat to the fleet. Yep. Give me something good to sweep. Oh, yeah.
[00:33:41] Where'd you get stationed? So the, the detailer gave me, hey, your options are you go to Japan,
[00:33:46] or you can go to Virginia, or you can go to Jacksonville, Florida. And so Japan sounded kind of cool,
[00:33:53] but I was worried that if I went there, it'd be harder to get back. And so, and I really didn't
[00:33:57] want to go to Virginia because I heard a lot of bad things about being in the fleet. There's a lot
[00:34:01] colder. I was like, Florida's kind of nice. I mean, Rhonda Santas wasn't there at the time,
[00:34:06] but I, I'd still heard good things. And so I was like, uh, I'll go to Florida. I'll go to Mapleort
[00:34:12] and I remember Jaco, I drove, I drove across country and showed up there and I looked at that
[00:34:19] ship. And I was like, and I knew I was going to be sleeping on that ship for the next at least
[00:34:22] cup year or so. I actually slept in my car, man. I was like, oh my god, this is going to suck.
[00:34:28] And it did suck. What are you in E3 at this point? Yeah. So you check on board your ship.
[00:34:35] Did you get skullary duty out of the gate? Like, like, mass X. Yeah. No, I didn't, um, matter of fact,
[00:34:43] I got hooked up on that on that regard. I never went crank. We call it cranking. Yeah,
[00:34:48] that's cranking. Yeah. That's cranking. And, uh, my, my rotation didn't come up for probably
[00:34:54] until I'd been on the ship like a year or so. And instead of going cranking, I went and did
[00:34:58] something called the Hab team. And we were just rehabilitating spaces. It was the easiest duty
[00:35:04] I'd ever had on the ship. I worked for the, I worked for the post office clerk. And, uh, like,
[00:35:12] they would just pick a space or two every week. And we would just go in. We would tape off the space.
[00:35:17] We would tape off everything that couldn't get painted. And we would just paint it. And other than that,
[00:35:21] like, that's all we had to do. And they pulled me out of my division. So I didn't have to do any of
[00:35:26] the divisional work. I wasn't standing watches. And it was like the, it was like the easiest duty I
[00:35:32] ever did. All my buddies that were, you know, and, and the gunners made division were so pissed off
[00:35:37] at me that couldn't believe that I was getting a good deal. So we had this little gym on board.
[00:35:42] It was probably the size of this room that no kidding. Maybe a little bit bigger.
[00:35:47] Well, what ship was it? It was the USS Gettysburg. It was an ages missile cruiser.
[00:35:51] CG64. And, uh, there were over, like 450 people on the ship echo. So there were two gyms about
[00:35:59] this size. 400. And they would close it down if like the ship was rolling too much. And so it was like,
[00:36:07] you would show up, hoping to get a workout in two treadmills. And then, you know, they were almost
[00:36:13] always busy. And the food you're eating is garbage. You know, and so it was like, not only that,
[00:36:20] but you would typically, underway, you would work your regular day. Like, let's just say, you know,
[00:36:26] six in the morning to five in the afternoon. And then every single night you would have to stand
[00:36:32] to watch. You would either have the eight to midnight or the ballast before as we called it,
[00:36:37] where the four to eight. And so your sleep was always interrupted. You were always getting treated like
[00:36:42] crap in the in the fleet. And, um, but it, again, it was good for me. It's what I needed to grow
[00:36:49] up. And even in those circumstances, I said that I was immature when I went through Buds the first time.
[00:36:56] And I still think I'm a little immature now. It's a progression. And, uh, but it was cool because
[00:37:03] I started, I started looking back on, okay, what did I do wrong? How do I make this? How do I make
[00:37:09] this right? How do I improve while I'm out here? And even in those circumstances, I think I wasn't
[00:37:14] under a boat anymore running with that heavy boat or, you know, I couldn't, I couldn't step up
[00:37:19] for my buddies in that circumstance. But there were times where we were all tired. Nobody wanted
[00:37:25] to take the watch or nobody wanted to take the trash out or nobody wanted to do this. And there were
[00:37:29] times where I could practice, you know, taking it, you know, taking one for the team. And that's,
[00:37:35] that was part of what I needed to do. And just learn how to be that guy. You know, when, um,
[00:37:41] when the team needed you. And so and just grow up a little bit. But so, so how long did you
[00:37:48] spend on that ship? Two and a half years. Did you do one deployment or two deployments? Two.
[00:37:53] They said that seal instructors and the recommendation on on my exit, Evalor, whatever it's called,
[00:37:59] was he like, we recommend he comes back in a year. But the seal of a ship won't get a replacement
[00:38:06] if they, if they let you go to a special program so that they were like, no, it's just, we're,
[00:38:11] we're, you're staying here. We can't be undermaned. And so at what point did you commit to like,
[00:38:16] I'm going back above them and make it? So this is an interesting story. And it, it talks about,
[00:38:23] you know, it's all about taking, taking risk at times because Jocca, when,
[00:38:29] when my orders came through to go to Buds, I still had a year left on my contract. So I could
[00:38:37] agon the buds either past or failed. And then, you know, whatever, or if I failed, I could just get out.
[00:38:44] Yep. The Navy was like, nope. You're, you're going to read on this for another four years
[00:38:49] if you want those orders. They dropped that on me the day that I was scheduled to leave the ship. I was so
[00:38:54] pissed. And I was just like, I can't believe it because I'm face, I'm staring down the barrel.
[00:38:59] Because I, I used to get the four year mark now. I was at the three year mark. Okay. Oh, so your first
[00:39:04] enlistment was like three years because you didn't get through Buds. Well, it was, I had a four year
[00:39:08] enlistment, but when my orders came through, I was at my three year mark. Got it. So I had enough time
[00:39:13] on my contract where even if I went to Buds failed out, I could just get out. I'm out, clean, clean
[00:39:18] escape. Don't have to come back to the fleet. But the Navy was like, nope, you're signing a
[00:39:22] four. They knew they know that how much of leverage they have on kids that want to go back to
[00:39:27] seal training or do seal training or special program or whatever. And so like I remember calling
[00:39:32] some mentors in my life, I was like, hey man, this is what I'm staring at. What do you think?
[00:39:36] And I also, I was just praying. I was like, Lord, this is the only thing, this is the only thing
[00:39:43] on my heart. And I was even praying while I was underway on the Gettysburg. I was like, Lord,
[00:39:47] if this is not what you want me to do, please take it from me. Because I don't, I had, I
[00:39:52] want to walk in your favor. I want to, I want to be the man you want me to be. And I want to do what
[00:39:56] you want me to do. But this is the only thing on my heart. And so if it's not what you want me to
[00:40:01] do, please, like path me out of here, you know, send me down the path, whatever path you want me to
[00:40:07] go down. Because I'm a knucklehead. And if you don't help me and guide me and direct me in this,
[00:40:13] I'm going to probably make a bad decision. And so, but yeah, it was still, it was still,
[00:40:18] so the fire still burned, you know, to go back, even knowing that if I didn't make it, I was going
[00:40:24] to be right back in the fleet. So that's one of the hard things about the Navy, all you
[00:40:30] young men that listen to this show, you know, is it, at least in the Marines or in the Army, man,
[00:40:35] it's like, if you'll make it through a program, you can go being a conventional unit in fight,
[00:40:39] bro, you're going to be fighting some rust and some dust in the Navy for a polishing some brass,
[00:40:47] sweeper sweeper's man, man, your broom did. It's bad. And it must have been super hard to prepare now
[00:40:55] since you're on a ship underway to deployments in two years. You're eating food that sucks for
[00:41:00] your health. Chili dogs, baby. Chili dogs. How did you stay in shape or how did you get in shape?
[00:41:08] Once I got, once I knew that my orders, once I submitted my package, I went right back to
[00:41:14] a, I got a drop a bunch of weight. I got in a little bit stronger, put on a little bit more muscle,
[00:41:19] but I started dropping a weight again so that, you know, I could keep up on the runs and whatnot.
[00:41:25] Sometimes they'd let us run around the ship. Sometimes, you know, sometimes they wouldn't, but,
[00:41:32] you know, I just did any time I got the opportunity to work out, I did. And, you know, I was hoping
[00:41:38] that the increased maturity was really going to help me out a lot, but, you know, I just worked out
[00:41:46] whenever I can and I definitely don't feel like I was ready just because of what I came out of,
[00:41:51] but I was more ready mentally to, you know, go back and I think that was where my biggest,
[00:41:57] where my biggest issue was. And so you get back to buds easier this time or maybe not easier,
[00:42:03] but you're more mentally prepared. Yeah, it was, it was easier in the fact that I was mentally
[00:42:09] prepared and I knew, you know, I'd seen a lot of the movie already. The difference was,
[00:42:16] is that when I got back the second time right off the bat, I got pneumonia. And so I failed. So I already
[00:42:22] have horrible lungs and now I've gotten pneumonia, like just ravaging them. And so I failed my
[00:42:27] first two runs. And like so they were like, look, if you fail one more run, you're done, we're
[00:42:34] dropping you and I hadn't even got back to hell week. So I'm like, oh my god dude, I'm not even
[00:42:38] going to get back to where I was where I made it to the first time. And so thank God, I passed my
[00:42:46] third run and got an opportunity going to hell week. And so thankfully, you know, I made it,
[00:42:54] you know, passed that run, made it through hell week. And then, but I was on the bubble, the
[00:42:58] entire rest of seal training for runs. Yeah. And I was a horrible runner. Every time, like, came in,
[00:43:04] like, made, you know, four, three, two, you know, one second. Exactly. Exactly.
[00:43:12] Was hell week? Was it, was it better going through the first time when you didn't really know
[00:43:18] what to expect or the second time where you did know what to expect? Which one was better,
[00:43:22] which one was worse? For me, the second one was much better, just because I think that there's a
[00:43:30] lot of, you know, fear and anxiety going into something like that that you know has taken out
[00:43:35] so many men better than you or perceivably better than you and stronger than you and faster than
[00:43:41] you. And you can't argue with the data. I mean, so many guys don't make it through that.
[00:43:45] And so I knew I could make it through it. And I also knew there was a part of me that was like,
[00:43:55] I don't stay to wake for maybe 48 hours before going into hell week the first time. Maybe,
[00:44:01] probably not even that long. Probably like 30 something like that. And so there's a part of you that's
[00:44:07] like, if you've never done something, okay, how am I going to stay awake? How's the body even
[00:44:11] do that? Stay awake from five and a half days and just get destroyed the entire time? And so there's
[00:44:16] always that part of you that's like, okay, I know they can't kill me, but this just doesn't make a lot
[00:44:21] of sense. At the end of the day, I'm exhausted, I'm tired. What would, what would things look like if,
[00:44:26] if I didn't sleep for five, five and a half days? How would I function? How, so the fact that I
[00:44:31] had already done it and gone through it, I was like, I know I can do this. I know that, you know,
[00:44:36] one of the things that I like to tell people, this is how it felt for me was, you know how echo
[00:44:40] you always get like a, even today, you'll probably get a second win, you'll feel tired and then you'll
[00:44:45] get a second win. That's how I felt. I felt like every time like, you know, five, six, seven hours
[00:44:51] into, you know, into it, my, I'd get tired. I'd just wait an hour and then I'd get a second win and
[00:44:56] I'd be right back in it. And that's kind of cool that your body works that way, but they also said that
[00:45:02] your body will stop like shutting, it'll start shutting down functions that aren't necessary to
[00:45:08] survival like growing fingernails or facial hair. I don't know if that's true, but that's what they told us.
[00:45:15] Yeah, that's crazy. And, and then that's it. I mean, you, you, you, you make it through buds this second
[00:45:21] time, even though you're on the bubble the entire time for runs. Yeah. But you make it through.
[00:45:28] I make it through. And then, um, I'm told I get orders, still team three. Most of my class got
[00:45:36] orders to the East Coast. They're only six of us is stayed on the West Coast. Sure. How is one of the
[00:45:41] fortune once? So you get through it, you graduate and where'd you get orders to?
[00:45:48] Uh, still team three. And did that, the most your class get West Coast, these coasts, even split? How
[00:45:54] did, how did they do that? So only six of us stayed on the West Coast, everybody else went to the East
[00:45:59] Coast. So I was, I felt lucky. Dang. And where was team three at the time? What was going on?
[00:46:05] Team three was already deployed at the time. You got, you got this was those, this is Rommati.
[00:46:10] Oh, so yeah. So what they told us, Joco, is it, all right, team three is deployed. You
[00:46:16] guys are just going to stay here and go to schools. And so it was interesting because I had just
[00:46:20] married my wife in between buds and SKT. And so I'm like, this is awesome, babe. I'm just going to,
[00:46:26] you know, hang out at the team and like, maybe, you know, sweep for a little bit and like,
[00:46:30] go to a school every once in a while. We can start our life together. So why don't you move out?
[00:46:33] She just graduated from our university of Arizona. Like, why don't you move out when we can
[00:46:37] start our marriage together? Did you run that grant through the US Navy? No, no. But, Chaco, the chief,
[00:46:45] in charge of us was like, now you guys are good to go. You're not deploying. We've, you know, we've
[00:46:49] talked it through a bubble, blah, blah. And so she moves out and we move into this little apartment here
[00:46:55] in Point Loma. And, and then two weeks later, they're like, hey, change of plans. You're deploying,
[00:47:01] and it's soon, you're, you're going to go through Searschool and then you're going to deploy.
[00:47:06] And so I don't remember what, what it was that happened. But for the guys went through Searschool the
[00:47:13] week before I did and then they deployed. And so I went through Searschool by myself and then to
[00:47:20] pull like flew over by myself on like a civilian airplane. And I'm just like, oh my, dude, I was so
[00:47:27] stressed out. First time going to war. Don't know any of the guys at Searschool Team 3,
[00:47:32] but my instructors have told us, hey, listen, you guys, when you get there, keep your mouth shut,
[00:47:38] do what you're told. You're about to swim with some great white sharks. That's, that's basically
[00:47:43] the advice. And so I don't know anybody. I'm flying the war by myself. I don't even have any guns.
[00:47:48] And it's just like, you don't know, I had nothing to compare to. I, I'd, I'd been, I'd been on a
[00:47:53] ship before, but I'm flying into a war zone with no guns. Like, I don't know what's going to,
[00:47:59] is the playing in a land is like, I'm going to have to PLF out of the plane because there's like,
[00:48:03] people shooting us like, I have no idea or no context for what that's going to look like. And then
[00:48:08] I'm going to have to like integrate into this platoon of guys that already did a work up together.
[00:48:14] And so anyway, we were what 30 minutes down the road from you guys in Bravo Platoon. I think there
[00:48:22] were four or five of us, four of us that went to Bravo Platoon. And so we started immediately,
[00:48:28] you know, doing the new guy job, you know, making sure the hummers are gasped up, making sure
[00:48:33] they're clean, making sure the windows have all the moon dust wiped off. I'm making sure the
[00:48:37] two 40s and the 50s are clean, oiled up ready for the op. And then it was cool because they threw
[00:48:43] us in to turret gunning immediately. And I was like, this is fantastic, man. Because all of our
[00:48:48] buddies, you know, are doing whatever they're doing on the east coast and we're already getting
[00:48:52] to go on ops with these guys. Yeah, that's freaking awesome. And the culture was, and that
[00:48:58] platoon was really cool in that the rule was this. We're not messing with you unless we need to.
[00:49:06] And then if we need to, we're going to tighten you up. And you know, but it was just like as long
[00:49:11] as you, as long as you walk around on egg shells, do the new guy thing, you know, we'll leave
[00:49:17] you alone. But you're going to, you're going to do all the crappy jobs that nobody wants to do.
[00:49:22] You're going to do it standing tall with respect. And, you know, I was totally totally all about that.
[00:49:28] Things changed a little bit once I came into bruiser. They're very next.
[00:49:33] I try to think of how many guys came to task unit bruiser in Ramadi. You guys got, you
[00:49:40] guys got, sold the front. I know you got sal. And another dude named Sean. Okay. Sean H. Yeah.
[00:49:47] Yeah. Sal was, he was, he was such a nice guy. And he had, and he smiled all the time. This is the,
[00:49:57] this is the, this is the, this is the invention of normal face. So I had this thing I do with sal,
[00:50:03] where I, I'd taken the, the cardboard like, entered from the spools of paper that we'd print
[00:50:11] maps on. Yeah. And I'd sit there and I'd be like, all right, Sal, listen up, bro. You can't be,
[00:50:15] you're, you're like, supposed to be a seal now. You can't be having this big smile on your face.
[00:50:19] You look like a dork. We don't look like dorks. And of course, this is all like hilarious. So
[00:50:25] he's smiling even more. And I'm like, okay, so here's what we're going to do. You can't smile.
[00:50:28] If you smile, I'm going to whack you in the head with this thing. And, you know, so when
[00:50:31] I'd start going ready, then he'd be like, this is her. And I go, go. And he couldn't, he couldn't
[00:50:35] keep like a normal face for a half a second. I'd have to whack him in the head, but he was a
[00:50:40] freaking good guy, funny and just had a good attitude, but he just smiled a lot. And of course,
[00:50:45] whatever you're going to do, if you don't smile, you're going to get beat for not smiling. If you
[00:50:50] smile too much, you're going to beat for smiling too much. So you're going to get beat. I mean,
[00:50:54] that's basically what the whole concept was when you rolled out. When we, when we get to, when we
[00:51:00] get to it, remind me to tell you a funny, sad friend, a story that involved you in skits. Okay.
[00:51:08] Yeah, maybe it's too scary. It's too scary. That lost to been good. So you ended up, I mean,
[00:51:15] that's still even for Sal for you, for you guys to roll on, out on a deployment. You haven't even
[00:51:20] done a work of before you guys get to go out. You guys get to do some ops, get some experience,
[00:51:23] get to know what it's like to drive down the road in the middle of night waiting to get
[00:51:28] blown up, which is, which is fun. Then what? So then, then the deployment's over? Yeah, then
[00:51:38] the deployment's over. And I flew back on the last bird. And, and what, what, what, how
[00:51:46] did we run the same bird? If it was the last bird, we were on the last bird. I don't think so. I was
[00:51:51] relaxed, so he wasn't there. But yeah. So anyway, I get back, and it's weird because
[00:52:01] all the guys had already been back. They were already like selecting the new platoons. I was on
[00:52:05] the last bird, so I get in late. And then I remember, you know, getting back, me and my wife, we schedule
[00:52:12] our first like date night. Like we're going to finally get a go out and celebrate a hanging out,
[00:52:17] made it back, all that. And so I'm, we're, she's getting ready. I'm already ready to go like, you
[00:52:23] know, that that goes out of date nights. And I get a call from one of my other new guy, but he's
[00:52:30] that just came back with me, but he came back, I think, before me. And he's like, hey,
[00:52:35] you need to get down to Danny's right now. And I'm like, what? And he's like, yeah, bro,
[00:52:40] we're in Delta, Platoon now. Get down here right now. And I'm like, no, dude, I'm, I'm off.
[00:52:47] People going, he's like, Eli, I'm not asking me, I'm telling you, get your ass down to Danny's now.
[00:52:52] So I got to go tell my wife, like, hey, there's going to be no date night. I don't know what's
[00:52:57] going on, but it's sound serious. So I'm rolling down the world worth three is apparently broken out.
[00:53:03] There's a situation. It happens to be a bar in Coronado. Yeah. And so like, I jump in my little
[00:53:09] green Honda Civic and I drive over the barrage as fast as I can and without, you know, getting
[00:53:13] arrested and he's like, he's like, just when you get the Danny's come out behind the bar.
[00:53:18] I'm like, oh, this sounds fantastic. He's like, yeah, we're in Delta, Platoon,
[00:53:22] Chris cows are LPO. And I'm like, awesome. And so I get there. I walk through the bar, all the new
[00:53:29] guys that I just like graduated, you know, SQT with some of which went down, some of which didn't
[00:53:35] are now standing at attention in lines behind Danny, just getting screamed at. And I'm like,
[00:53:41] holy cow, dude. So yeah, that was, and so that night, you know, we were, you know, it was the
[00:53:49] end, end doctrine, end, end talking the tea bruiser, right? And so this guy, this guy, you know,
[00:53:58] he wasn't there, but it was just, yeah, it was, it was interesting because the culture had
[00:54:03] completely shifted to, hey, man, totally new, new group of dudes, new rules. And yeah, I realized
[00:54:13] real quick that this was going to be a interesting two years and you better be locked on.
[00:54:19] Like, we would come in, like, we would come in to rooms like the new guys like back to back,
[00:54:24] like, our hands ready to go because you didn't know what was, you didn't know what were
[00:54:29] you were going to be, get it with, but they definitely, they definitely loved having new guys around,
[00:54:36] I'll tell you that. Yeah, I guess that answers my question. I was going to ask you if you got
[00:54:39] treated like a new guy, since you kind of had a little bit of a deployment, I guess the answer is
[00:54:44] a solid, yes. Oh, yeah, they were like, yeah, that's like a little bit worse because they're like,
[00:54:48] you lucky bastard, you got to go over there and you didn't even do a workup. That was the thing,
[00:54:52] they're like, hey, that didn't count. You're doing a full workup. You will be a new guy for a full
[00:54:58] two years and it was like, Roger that. And you know, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?
[00:55:04] So, talk it. Did you, uh, what position did you get in the platoon? We were a double.
[00:55:10] A double turret gunner. Yep. And it was, it was cool, but I, I like to talk about my failures,
[00:55:17] because I think that's where the gold off and is Chris actually sat down with each and every one of
[00:55:23] us with his like little green notebook and he's like, all right, tell me what, what your goals,
[00:55:27] what do you want to accomplish, what do you want to do? And I said, I want to become a sniper. And so,
[00:55:33] he actually, you know, and I think there were a couple other, but that was,
[00:55:36] of other guys that wanted to go to sniper school, but that was my number one thing. And so he actually
[00:55:40] sent me to sniper school. My first, as a new guy. Yeah. And I failed. Oh, no, man, I made it through
[00:55:47] pick and then scout and then I didn't qualify expert on the, the M4, the 200 yard
[00:55:56] quality you have to do before you actually get to go to sniper school. And so I was, that was hard,
[00:56:02] you know, imagine coming back and telling Chris, hey, I just blew that. And so they didn't get
[00:56:07] an extra billet because I failed. So Chris wasn't happy about that. It definitely went in the book of
[00:56:14] whoa. And yeah, so, you know, paid paid for that pretty dearly, but, you know, I mean, you know,
[00:56:24] it is what it is. Wasn't like I was, wasn't trying. Yeah, the people, I guess it's hard to,
[00:56:32] it's hard to see from the public persona that got put out of Chris of like how funny he was and
[00:56:37] how like shit talking he was, it just like, and the other thing that sounds craziest, the
[00:56:43] prank, like he like to do like pranks on people like a little kid, you know. You did. That was when
[00:56:50] people asked me all the time, they're like, so what do you think of that movie? And I was like,
[00:56:54] you know, the movie is, you know, it's decent, whatever. But I was like the number one thing that they
[00:56:58] screwed up was like that they missed like how funny he was in his tensor humor and how he was
[00:57:06] always doing something shady. Always doing something shady. But I guess I don't, maybe it
[00:57:12] wouldn't, maybe Hollywood didn't think it'd be as cool of a movie as if, you know, they portrayed
[00:57:17] him that way. Yeah, I guess they would have had to make it into a, like a mini series or something
[00:57:22] where they could, where they could develop the character, develop his personality so you could
[00:57:27] see all sides, which would have made it more impactful because then you'd see, hey, this guy that
[00:57:32] is very funny loves his family and likes to clown around. I also can be totally serious and has a
[00:57:40] very, has the most serious job. But, you know, they got to take all that stuff and like you said,
[00:57:45] they got to make it into a movie that's now and a half long and that's what they did. Yeah, they took
[00:57:49] like 15, 20 years of his life and condensing it now and a half. So I mean, you know, that can't be
[00:57:55] easy to do. Yeah. How was that work up? Good. So I was, I was, I was running your work up.
[00:58:01] Yeah. Thank you, by the way. My God, did unbelievable. Do you carry any wounded guys anymore?
[00:58:08] Yeah. We actually, dude, it was so crazy. Like, you know, and it was cool to see you because you'd
[00:58:17] come out all the time. And I can't remember which one's, which years you were even out for, but
[00:58:24] it was, I do remember doing like, you know, seven click insert in, you know, hit the target and then
[00:58:33] on the way, ex-fill, this guy would put half of our guys down at least. So I mean, I would, you guys would
[00:58:40] you guys would get tore up by the hot for. All right. I think there might have been a little bit of a
[00:58:49] suggestion from this guy to make it as hard as humanly possible just by reading some of his stuff.
[00:58:54] And, but I, you know, it was interesting because like you would, you know, you do your op,
[00:58:59] you do your mission and then like you've got another, you know, click or two to ex-fill out and,
[00:59:05] you know, trade it's putting down over half of your guys. And so, you know, it's already, you've
[00:59:11] already got your body armor on, you've got like a machine gun, you've already got like, you know,
[00:59:16] you're loaded for bearer. And now you've got to carry, you know, another 250, maybe even depending
[00:59:23] on his size. We had some beasts in my pool too. And so, you know, maybe another 300 pound dude,
[00:59:28] and it was just like brutal. I remember, remember one time I was getting ready to pick up,
[00:59:34] want a down seal and it was chief D. And he's a big muscular dude, the type of guy that was,
[00:59:42] you did not want to piss off. And also, let's say like, he's not going to be super light.
[00:59:46] He is not super light. Yeah. He's, he's really heavy. And so, I am a freaking stud. He just want to be,
[00:59:55] like, everyone just wants to like do good, especially his guys. Yeah. They want to, they want to
[01:00:00] kick ass form. And so, I had my guns on my back, but I didn't like have it retention or anything.
[01:00:06] So, I went down to like grab his upper torso and my gun comes over top and hits him on the
[01:00:13] head. And I was, he was like, oh my god, who did that? Thank God it was night time.
[01:00:20] And you couldn't see you did it. And I got it. Joko, I didn't take extreme ownership
[01:00:26] because he wanted guilty. And I just like, I just, we got him up and we, you know, we started
[01:00:31] moving in, but extreme ownership might have cost me my life right there. So, yeah, we didn't,
[01:00:38] I didn't tell chief D that it was me that didn't sling my gun and just smack him in the face,
[01:00:42] but yeah, I think the good thing about the way that you ran training was that there was nothing that
[01:00:50] I ever faced that was even close to the training. And I think that's a good thing.
[01:00:55] I wasn't always happy with you about it. I remember one time you were out at, I think you
[01:01:00] were out at a San Clemente or something. And instead of like, okay, we, we do the day runs,
[01:01:05] we do the night runs, we go to sleep. There, you didn't let us go to sleep. It was just like,
[01:01:10] okay, TST, here we go. We're going back in the town. We got to go hit this and I'm like,
[01:01:15] God, dude. Well, I always thought of like day runs, night runs, morning runs. I made after noon runs.
[01:01:21] Yeah. You know, brunch runs. How's that sound? We'll get a little bit of that.
[01:01:25] And Stoner was your to you commander? Yeah, he was, uh, he was the to you commander there from
[01:01:31] O6 to O8, right after you left. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's when he got, that's when he got hurt.
[01:01:37] Yep. He broke his neck. Uh, yeah. That happened. Luckily, he didn't break his spine. He just broke
[01:01:45] vertebrae and his neck when a dude fell off. One of the other new guys fell off of the ship
[01:01:51] boarding and landed on top of him broke his neck. I remember I was at, obviously, I was at Traydeck
[01:01:57] and I get the call like, hey, we got an injury and I'm like, all right, Roger. And then I got like a
[01:02:01] text from someone's like, hey, it's Stoner. And I was like, check, went up to the hospital. But thank God,
[01:02:08] he, uh, he didn't break his spinal cord. So he was able to put on the neck brace,
[01:02:15] kind of walk through the rest of until that was healed up and, and he still able to go on
[01:02:20] appointment because he wasn't going to stay home. I mean, no, no. Well, that brings up another
[01:02:26] funny story because, uh, remember, uh, I don't know if this guy's still in. Anyway, our L.T.
[01:02:34] During that period, Texan guy, Jimmy. Yep. He, uh, he made us roll. He made us do jujitsu three times a week.
[01:02:43] Yeah, right? These, you know, all of them, you know, fall into following this guy's footstep.
[01:02:49] And so we would, we would roll. We did jujitsu before, uh, before the day started and, uh,
[01:02:55] I remember one time, I got somebody, I can't remember who it was. Another L.T.
[01:03:01] in a triangle choke. And I, I was tying it in good and he picked me up, stacked me and
[01:03:06] dropped me on my neck and I heard something go pop, pop. And I was like, okay, you know, and we
[01:03:12] did a quick time out and I was like, okay, I can still move it. And then we, we finished the day.
[01:03:17] I'm okay. Like, we finished the rolling. I feel okay. And then it's take a shower and then it starts
[01:03:22] getting real tight and real stiff. And I, I'm like, man, I, this is, this doesn't feel right.
[01:03:28] Maybe I should go say something. So I've made a mistake and I went and said something. And I told
[01:03:33] Chris, I was like, hey, I did something while I was rolling. I heard some pops in my neck.
[01:03:37] And, uh, it's starting to get really, really tight. And he's like, okay, go over to medical. So medical
[01:03:43] made, um, called an ambu. It came to the, to this, you know, three picked me up, put, like,
[01:03:50] put me on like a bed or whatever they took me to Balboa, they'd X-rays or whatever. And they're like,
[01:03:57] you know, they're like, oh, you're good. You're good to go. So they brought me back and, uh,
[01:04:02] put they made me put a neck brace on. And so I walk into C-chris and, uh, and I take in the neck
[01:04:08] brace off. And he's like, so, uh, what would happen? And I'm like, I'm good to go. They did X-rays.
[01:04:14] He's like, did they give you anything? And I'm like, well, this neck brace, but, you know,
[01:04:17] I don't need it. I'm good. And he's like, no, put the neck brace on. So, Chris had the guys paint
[01:04:22] it pink. And then made me wear the neck brace for like the next week. And I was like, even when we,
[01:04:28] like, because we were just getting ready to go to Pendleton. And so he made me wear it out and
[01:04:32] town. He made me wear it everywhere. And I was just like, oh, and I'm never saying anything ever
[01:04:37] to get like I said, like that's a flood. Yeah. And then, uh, so how was that deployment? It was, you know,
[01:04:49] it was, I think it was good. I know a lot of guys weren't happy about it. But, um, we started on the
[01:04:57] Syrian border in Al-Qaim. We turned over with an SF unit. And the deployment started out by
[01:05:03] with our primary focus trying to stop foreign fighters and equipment and, you know, all sorts of
[01:05:11] money and stuff flowing in from Syria into Iraq. And so we did a lot of desert patrols.
[01:05:19] And, you know, that it's not, I don't think it's what team guys really love doing. But it, you know,
[01:05:24] it is what it is. And then probably, and we actually spent a lot of the first month and a half building
[01:05:32] up a structure to live in. So we called ourselves seal beasts. Like we had two CBs that were like
[01:05:37] constantly telling us what to do, how to build this structure. And so we built that. And then,
[01:05:43] after we got that finished, um, that's when I think the army called and said, hey, we're, we're going
[01:05:49] to, we're going to, we're going to cordon off, solder city. And we need some seal snipers. And
[01:05:55] some guys to come in and help us do that because, uh, all solder's militia was killing the Iraqi
[01:06:02] contractors that were building the wall. And so that's when Stoner and Chris and several other
[01:06:10] guys, somewhere, army 33 texts, some, some were calm skies and many of them were snipers,
[01:06:17] from seal team eight. And then from seal team three, they formed like this super troop,
[01:06:21] um, which Topstoner was in charge of. And so they, they went and left us, I think four of them
[01:06:29] went from our platoon. And then the rest of us stayed back and we just went all over, you know,
[01:06:35] went all over the country. We flew some humvies up to Missoul. And then towards the end of the
[01:06:41] deployment, Chris came back and I actually got to go and, you know, be a part of that for like the
[01:06:47] last month and a half or something like that. But it was, you know, it was a decent platoon,
[01:06:52] but we were all over, I mean, instead of operating out of one place, we spent time in Alessad,
[01:06:59] we spent time and I think hit Haditha, we even, we even built the new basin, Rawa,
[01:07:05] when Alkaya got shut down. So we were just like transit all over the place. Yeah, yeah, that there's
[01:07:10] it always sucks when you're not like with your whole platoon. It's also there's cool things about
[01:07:17] traveling all over the place that my first deployment to Iraq, we lived in Baghdad the whole time,
[01:07:23] but we would go out to all over the country. So that was kind of, you know, you just get to see
[01:07:28] different areas and we'd stay for day here two days here, some random like SF outstation,
[01:07:34] the middle nowhere and hang out with them, do whatever we can to support and then come back. So that's
[01:07:39] kind of cool. And then my second deployment to Iraq, I didn't leave her body like it was just
[01:07:44] there the entire time and that was also cool in a different way. So kind of different experiences,
[01:07:50] they both have something cool about them. They also have some things that kind of, you know,
[01:07:55] might not be as cool, but what was like the big lessons learned on that deployment for you as a human.
[01:08:02] Oh man, let's see, be you know, be flexible, you know, be adaptable. I found that that was so
[01:08:15] key in that in that job is just to be flexible, adaptable and try and keep a positive mental outlook
[01:08:22] it all, you know, at all times. And the other thing to I started to see like,
[01:08:27] started to see how negativity and complaining could affect the morale of the group and it,
[01:08:39] you know, it could be detrimental. And so always try and, you know, be, you know, be a part of
[01:08:48] not bringing people down, bringing the group down, but just being positive, you know, because there was
[01:08:53] some, there was some of that going on in that group, like, you know, some real negativity and,
[01:09:00] you know, I get it, I understand why, but at the same time, I don't, I don't know that it,
[01:09:08] you know, was very productive, making us the most cohesive, you know, fighting unit that we could
[01:09:14] possibly be. Yeah, when that real simple idea of complaining and it's so bad. And that's one thing
[01:09:24] I picked up from wherever in the teams was like, hey, don't complain, don't ever complain about anything,
[01:09:30] don't complain if you're cold, don't complain if you're hot, don't complain if you've been
[01:09:34] awake too long, don't complain about anything, just don't complain, just don't complain. And, you know,
[01:09:40] obviously not everyone gets on board with that program, but it never, it never, complaining just never
[01:09:46] helps anything, just doesn't, like if you, if you want to joke about it, that's cool. If you want to
[01:09:51] jokingly, you know, bring something up because you're going to make fun of the situation you're in,
[01:09:57] man, that's a different thing. But if you're going to, if you're going to seriously say,
[01:10:03] it's too hot, it's too cold, we're not getting the support, we need this is bullshit. Like those
[01:10:08] attitudes, they're just, they're just, they're just, they're just not good. And that's why I always
[01:10:11] like that, that team guy that you just never hear him complain or when someone does complain,
[01:10:17] when you get, when you get the right crew, someone starts to complain, they get shut down, you know,
[01:10:22] and that's a good attitude to have. Is that where good? That is, that is 100% where good
[01:10:29] comes from. That's, that's freaking stone or that was stone or coming to tell me, coming to
[01:10:33] complain me about something and me saying, and him saying, like, I already know what you're going to say,
[01:10:37] and I'm like, what? And he says, you're going to say good, because that's what you say about everything,
[01:10:41] and it's true. I'd be like, oh, we don't, we don't, oh, we're going to have to stay out,
[01:10:45] freaking at this desert warfare training facility for an extra two weeks. Good, we're going to get
[01:10:50] better, whatever it is. Yeah. Let's not complain. That's not the deal. So you don't want
[01:10:58] from that deployment. Yep. And it's another puttune because you're a new guy still kind of,
[01:11:03] now you're one cruise wonder, one and a half cruise wonder. Right. Right. There's always something,
[01:11:09] Matt. Did you go, did you end up going back to sniper school? I did. Yeah. Where, when you got home?
[01:11:15] Yeah. So thankfully, I, I just got to go qualify and then I got to pick up where I left off.
[01:11:22] I learned a little trick that really helped me, you know how on our pistols you, you know,
[01:11:28] front sight focus, you have that little green dot and whatever or the little white dot.
[01:11:33] Wow, I was like, I was looking at the front sight post on my, you know, in four iron
[01:11:38] side and I was like, it's just straight black. I mean, aim small, miss small. And I was like,
[01:11:42] I took a little paint pen and I just put the tiniest little white dot on my front sight post.
[01:11:48] And that really helped me to like put it where I needed to and just I started doing a lot of
[01:11:53] dry firing and the positions that I was going to have to shoot and did well on the test and then
[01:11:58] went out to, went out to sniper school. I did really good on the shooting, but I was really
[01:12:02] bad at the stocking and I was like on the bubble the entire time. And, but, you know, made it through
[01:12:08] sniper school got my sniper sweet and then, unfortunately, by that point in 2010, we went to
[01:12:16] Felicia and they wouldn't allow us to take sniper weapons on, obviously, we're trying to de-escalate
[01:12:23] the war and snipers don't typically do that typically, they're gasoline on things. So, so that
[01:12:32] we still a pig gunner and that, or did we have to point manner somewhere? Yeah, I moved the point
[01:12:38] man and lead navigators as well. I was also running ordinance department. So,
[01:12:43] yeah, I mean, it was good. You know, and I was I felt, for the first time I felt like, I didn't
[01:12:51] feel like I was some great operator, but I felt like I felt confident for, you know, because it
[01:12:59] takes a while. I mean, there's so much that there's so much from like, comms to, you know,
[01:13:05] understanding maps to, you know, the physicality side of it to, you know, small unit tactics that
[01:13:11] you're trying to pick up and learn, but in that in special forces, you'll spend two, two weeks
[01:13:17] doing this and then you'll spend a month doing that and then sometimes it'll be four months before
[01:13:24] before you shoot your gun again, you know, and it's like, so I feel like, by that point, you know,
[01:13:30] in my service, I finally felt like I was, you know, okay, I feel comfortable doing this, I feel like
[01:13:36] I'm decent at it, you know, the learning curve of doing Patuens, I think exactly correlates to the
[01:13:42] learning curve of having children and your first kid, you have no idea what's going on, your total
[01:13:48] idiot, and but you learned so much by your second kid, you're like, okay, we kind of got this,
[01:13:53] by your third kid, you're like, I'm dialed, I'm ready. By your fourth kid, you're like, I got this,
[01:13:57] like, we're making shit happen. But you see, guys, in their first Patuens man, it's a lot of,
[01:14:04] it's a lot of stuff, especially nowadays, like when I was in my first Patuens, it was like, okay,
[01:14:08] your radio man, there's three radios, like it's it was just we weren't doing knots, we didn't have
[01:14:15] lasers on a weapons, everything was easier and guys now they have a lot more to learn, just even
[01:14:22] with the technical side there, more to learn and then from the operational side, there's more to learn,
[01:14:26] that's the way it goes. So that, what you do on that deployment, so, as you're as now,
[01:14:34] we're DSCliners, this is like 2010 now, yep, 2010 we're DSClinating, we were partnered up with
[01:14:39] FelusiusWatteam, we were still doing, you know, some DAs here and there, we were doing a lot of
[01:14:44] fit with them, making sure that, you know, they knew what they were doing, and we actually started
[01:14:49] me and one of our jails kind of ran the fit, and we were just making sure, we were trying to turn
[01:14:55] more and more of the op over to them, so by the time, by the time that platoon was over with,
[01:15:01] if we would go on an op and there were only allowed to be four seals on the ground, you had to have
[01:15:08] for every one seal, I think you had to have five Iraqis, that was the ratio it had to be,
[01:15:14] and so the, you know, the closest call I ever had was a night where we got ambushed by three
[01:15:21] dudes and we only had four seals on the ground, we had, we had, I think, two, three gun trucks,
[01:15:28] so we had three RG 33s with those remote weapon system, the remote 50 cows, but yeah, I mean,
[01:15:35] it was interesting getting, you know, an ambush like that, we're only got four dudes, and then a bunch
[01:15:40] of a bunch of FelusiusWatteam guys and you're like, you know, at one point, our AOS at the time,
[01:15:50] he was like, he was on my side of the street, just give us, like, give us, start to finish a little bit.
[01:15:55] Okay, so it was really interesting, Jaco, because as we were turning over things to the Iraqis so
[01:16:02] that they could hopefully stand on their own once we left, one of the, one of the very last things
[01:16:07] that we turned over to them was the actual coordinates for the target we were going to hit,
[01:16:12] and as a point man, I was sharing that responsibility with another, another one of my, you know,
[01:16:18] another, another guy in that platoon, and so we were, we were like doing blue and gold shifts,
[01:16:23] it was my night, and so they gave me like, hey, this is the, this is the eight-digit grid we're hitting,
[01:16:29] these are, you know, maps, you know, of the area that we're going to, we were actually going to
[01:16:35] obbograbe, which is like a suburb of Baghdad, and which of these like a 45-minute drive from Felusia,
[01:16:42] and so they were like, you know, notoriously nasty part of the city, yeah, the, like the
[01:16:47] prisons there that everyone's heard about obbograbe prison, but it's also like a part of town,
[01:16:51] and it's, it's notoriously a pretty bad part of town. Yeah, it was a real bad part, and anyway,
[01:16:57] so they, I can't remember who told me, but they were like, hey, like this is the first night,
[01:17:02] we're going to give these guys a great coordinates, so I want you to walk over there with an interpreter,
[01:17:08] well, you know, go outside our main base, go to there where they, where they were sleeping,
[01:17:13] the Felusia SWAT team, given the great coordinates for the target we're hitting, and I
[01:17:18] ask them, make sure that they know where we're going, because they're actually going to lead
[01:17:22] lead us out. And so I walked over there, I gave them the, you know, the great coordinate,
[01:17:28] I gave them all the maps and pictures, I was like, do you guys know where this is, and they're like,
[01:17:31] yeah, we know where this is, and so I was like, and at the time we had you feel funky about that.
[01:17:36] Very, and this made it worse to, we knew that there was one of them that was every time we left
[01:17:42] the wire that he was calling and telling people which direction we were headed. So, you know, you always,
[01:17:49] you always feel really, really shady about that. And so, gave it to them, and then probably at like
[01:17:55] one in the morning or something we took off started driving there. And I noticed,
[01:18:01] as soon as we drive into the neighborhood, there's like, sirens on all over the neighborhood,
[01:18:06] and like, like, we're already blown. And so we did like a video, a video drop off, like, vehicle
[01:18:14] drop off, like 600 yards from the target, because the argys are pretty loud, and we didn't want
[01:18:18] them to hear us like foot patrolling in or the vehicles. And so we get out, and there's four seals on
[01:18:24] the ground, and then there's like 20, fullo's your SWAT team members, and we start taking off,
[01:18:30] and I'm also point man that night. So, it's like a 600, it's only a 600 yard patrol in the target. And so,
[01:18:36] we're walking down this really, really wide street. And so I put us into like a file formation,
[01:18:42] so that at least a couple of us can engage if we get a contact front. And so we're walking in
[01:18:47] and probably halfway to the target. And I noticed that like, I guess.
[01:18:52] Oh, staggered file, you said fire, you meant staggered file, yeah. Okay, I'll get, I'll just try to
[01:18:56] make sure I'm tracking. No, no, no, no, thanks. And so we're walking, and, and I'm noticing as I'm
[01:19:04] walking, because you're always when you're patrolling, you're always looking for like cover,
[01:19:07] concealment, hey, if we get contacted from the front, where can I duck into, is there a wall, or a
[01:19:13] door, something like, and I notice everything's boarded up, bars everywhere, nothing is open. And so
[01:19:20] halfway there, all of a sudden, do three dudes with one had an RPK machine gun, and then the
[01:19:28] other two, I think had AK's. But we had a, we had a predator overhead, we had, I think two
[01:19:35] Apache's, and we had an AC 130 gun ship overhead. I'd never, we'd never gotten that much air
[01:19:42] in any op I'd ever been on it. And so three guys open up on us, and it was surreal because they
[01:19:49] guy with the RPK, no kid had probably 200 rounds belted together of Tracer. So you could see every bullet
[01:19:56] fine over us. And you know, in training that you're taught, okay, you hit the ground, make yourself
[01:20:04] as small as possible, make yourself a small target, and then return fire, gain fire,
[01:20:08] spirit, and then somebody's gonna, you know, we're, we're gonna maneuver, whatever the call is
[01:20:14] gonna come out, it's gonna be. And so I remember hitting the ground and just watching, you know,
[01:20:20] Tracer rounds fly over us for probably a minute and a half before he had to reload. And then I could
[01:20:26] see the other two, the other two guys, muzzle flashes, I'm thinking to myself, I thought, you know what,
[01:20:33] if I can see their muzzle flashes, even though I have a suppressor on my gun, because they're shooting
[01:20:37] high. I was like, if I open up right now, and the, the suppressor doesn't work as well as I hope
[01:20:43] it does. And they, they pinpoint my location, I'm dead, because it was, when we went back and looked
[01:20:48] at the footage from the Pred, feed, it was only 110 yard engagement. So it's very close. And so I did,
[01:20:56] where they, in a building, where they on a roof or something or not, they were coming, they were
[01:21:00] coming around a building. So I got to watch like, so they were external, so you could actually
[01:21:05] see them even from the Pred, because they were outside of the building. You could see them from the Pred,
[01:21:10] I couldn't see them, you know, even on nods. All I could see was their muzzle flash. And so anyway,
[01:21:17] like I wait, and I noticed that the, the, the, the little of fire dies down, and so as soon as it dies
[01:21:23] down, like I get up, and I'm like I said, I'm really slow. So, but I'm running back, you know,
[01:21:29] I'm, I must have been cooking echo. And I'm like, I'm moving as fast as I can. And I'm pretty,
[01:21:35] I'm pretty light. I only have, I think, four mags on me, you know, in four mags on me. And I'm running back.
[01:21:40] And the, oh, I see, I see his over here. And he had found, he's like, I got, I got an out,
[01:21:45] I got an out, and that for us means hey, man, I got some cover, come over here. And so I come over and
[01:21:50] I start, I bump him off and then, you know, start, I start returning fire and the gun trucks by this
[01:21:58] point pull up. Next, you know, next to me. And then this fight, I don't know, goes, this gun fight
[01:22:05] goes on for, I don't know, maybe maybe another couple minutes. And then the gun trucks start, you know,
[01:22:10] blasting these dudes with 50 cow and it like ends like that. They're like, no, we're done.
[01:22:16] But it was, it was, it was interesting because like, the, the A O I C was like, hey,
[01:22:23] let's flank. Let's, let's, let's, let's, and I, I was just thinking of myself, I was thinking of myself,
[01:22:29] hey, we were already blown when we came in. These guys, the gig was up. They knew we were coming here,
[01:22:34] because they were sirens all over the place. We've got a bunch of, you know, flujious,
[01:22:39] swat team guys. We know at least one of them is working on the other side. And they're not like,
[01:22:44] they're not a good fighting force at all. I'm like, I was like, bro, I don't think that's a good idea.
[01:22:49] And I see we hold what we got and get the hell out of here. And thankfully, you know, and I don't know how
[01:22:56] it would have worked out if we would have done, you know, what he wanted to, he was just being a
[01:23:01] hard charging, you know, oh, he was, he wanted to make moves and, you know, go just smoke these dudes.
[01:23:08] But I had a real bad feeling about it. And so, you know, thankfully he was like, he listened to me,
[01:23:14] and he was like, let's hold what we got. And we, you know, jumped in the trucks and we got the
[01:23:18] got the hell out of there. And then it was crazy because we, because Blir, not, it was actually
[01:23:26] Iraqi policeman that ambushed us. And so then they roll up. And it's like this, it's gets this
[01:23:33] heated exchange, like, what WTF, or you guys doing, you know, because we had to pass, you know,
[01:23:40] how that works, we have to pass up to, you know, their hire, I was like, where we're going to be
[01:23:43] operating. So there's the de-confliction that goes on. And it got really, it was starting to get a little
[01:23:50] tense. And I remember there were, we had some guys in the trucks, you know, just some shooters in
[01:23:55] the trucks. I'm like, hey, you guys get out of those trucks. If this goes down, we need to, we need to
[01:24:00] make sure that we finish this. And so anyway, nobody got, nobody got hurt on our side, which I couldn't
[01:24:08] believe because like I was watching hundreds of tracer rounds stream into what my chief's position.
[01:24:12] I thought he was done because he didn't come up over coms for probably 40 seconds to kind of make
[01:24:18] a call on what he wanted. But anyway, we got back, we drove back to Felicia after that. And it was
[01:24:24] kind of wild because the ROI I see at the time, who was actually, who was actually my swim buddy
[01:24:33] and buds and I really good friend of mine. He, you know, thankfully, he didn't bring this up in the
[01:24:39] de-breed, but he was like, he came to me in the team room and he was like, he like, well, what were you
[01:24:45] doing? What were you doing tonight? And I'm like, what are you talking about, dude? He's like,
[01:24:51] how was screaming at you from inside the RG 33 to get back? Because I was, once I bumped that guy out,
[01:24:58] I came out on the left and I started trying to engage their muzzle flashes with my laser.
[01:25:02] And he was like, he's like, bro, he's like, the wall right behind you, rounds were exploding right
[01:25:10] over your head. They had a total beat on you. They were just shooting like a foot high. And I was like,
[01:25:15] dude, I'm sorry, bro, I could not hear you. And that's one thing I learned on that deployment
[01:25:20] is that those cool silencers that we have that like work as coms pieces, but also ear pro,
[01:25:26] you can't hear the crack over your head because they cancel that anything over like 105
[01:25:31] decibels or whatever they were canceling it out. So I couldn't hear it. I didn't know they had a
[01:25:35] beat on me, but thankfully, it was down to you too. Thankfully, moves you to the Ohio. Thank God,
[01:25:45] man. But yeah, that was, that was interesting because because of the situation and we had so many
[01:25:53] jundies or you know, I right, flu just watch team members with us, it really limited our ability
[01:26:00] to do stuff when we needed to. So you wrap up that deployment and then what's your plan?
[01:26:14] Because now you've got two platoons, you maybe could do a third platoon, you maybe could go to training
[01:26:19] cell or trade debt, maybe you know, what's your options? What are you looking at? What are you
[01:26:24] making up your mind to do? Yeah. So I was looking at a couple different things. My body was pretty
[01:26:30] tore up at that point. I'd hurt my back really bad, you know, weightlifting. And I had,
[01:26:38] the Navy wasn't able to diagnose it at the time. Turns out, once I got out of the Navy and went
[01:26:42] to like a civilian dock, like laser spine instituted in Phoenix, they were like, hey, man, you got,
[01:26:47] you know, you got some stress fractures and you're spine, you've got some, you know, some stuff going
[01:26:53] on, we can either give you a fusion or we can just give you shots and I was just like, okay, I'll just
[01:26:58] wait. But my back was pretty messed up at that time. It really, you know, was pretty excruciating,
[01:27:03] just don't even wear a body armor. And so I'm looking at that. I'm looking at the fact that I've
[01:27:09] kind of done what I came to do as far as like I wanted to go serve my country and and I had little
[01:27:17] you know, I was kind of watching my little kids grow up in pictures or my oldest grow up in pictures.
[01:27:21] And I was just like, man, you know, that was kind of tearing, tearing at me a little bit. And so I was like,
[01:27:28] I'm either going to go, um, through our like ASO program. I need something new if I'm in a
[01:27:35] stay and do this, I'm going to either need to go like ASO or screen or something. But I'm not, you know,
[01:27:41] I need to, you know, I need to, you know, I need to some change. And so, started thinking about it,
[01:27:45] I was definitely praying about it. And uh, while I was on that deployment, I actually was like,
[01:27:50] but I want to make sure that I give myself enough time to make a good decision.
[01:27:54] Because my family's counting on it. And so I actually reinlisted on that deployment. And,
[01:28:00] at the time, you could give your kids the GI Bill if you reinlisted, you had enough time in,
[01:28:06] and, you know, uh, and so I split, I gave my daughter my GI Bill and re-listed for four, so that I had
[01:28:12] enough time to plan the exit and at that point, I was pretty confident that I was done, you know,
[01:28:19] you know, the point and I was, I started focusing on, okay, I need it, I need to exit.
[01:28:26] And, uh, I did, I did, you know, talk to some folks about ASO. I looked at it a little bit. I never
[01:28:32] really looked at screening. Um, and then as I went, I went to the recruiting director it after that.
[01:28:38] So that's when you got home from the deployment. Yes. You went to the recruiting director it.
[01:28:43] I don't even know what that is. Right. No, most people don't. Um, so when I came, is it an SW?
[01:28:50] Yes, sir. Yeah, got it. When I came into the teams, uh, we only were filling 60% of our
[01:28:57] billets at the schoolhouse. So that's why guys like me could come, you know, I knew guys that went
[01:29:03] to Buds three or four times. But now if you even if you come, well, I'm working off old information.
[01:29:10] But when I was at the recruiting director, even if you like were an Olympic athlete and you came
[01:29:15] in there and you crushed the screen test like it never been crushed before, early as Spot Year
[01:29:19] again was nine months out, you know. And so, um, what what the Navy did was, and the reason I took
[01:29:27] the job is because my old platoon chief and old, um, you know, master chief, uh, J.T. You know,
[01:29:34] J.T. Yep. Yep. He, uh, he said, hey, hey, Eli, if you come work for me, I'll let you go to school
[01:29:39] in the afternoon. So you can finish up that old degree, start working towards getting out and I'm like,
[01:29:44] no, that sounds like pretty cool. And, uh, so I took that job, started doing that, uh, working for him.
[01:29:51] And, uh, you know, it was, it was, it was interesting because the Navy sent us all over the country.
[01:29:58] They had done a Gallup survey that showed that there were seven different sports that young men were playing,
[01:30:05] that were, uh, enabling them to be more successful at a higher rate than, um, others.
[01:30:11] We're lucky. So one was Warripolo. I think two was swimming and three was wrestling.
[01:30:16] And that's where we spent most of our time. And it made total sense to me because like football players
[01:30:22] weren't doing well. And it made sense to me because like I was a quarterback and they were like,
[01:30:26] you know, they put a red jersey on me, like, don't hit that dude. Or like, you know, it was like,
[01:30:31] it was so position driven in football that, and when you look at it like wrestling,
[01:30:36] water pool swimming, you know, the types of sports like that were it's like, it doesn't matter.
[01:30:41] How big you are, you're doing everything. You know, and you're going to be held to a standard, you know,
[01:30:46] I mean, you look at Big Old Echo or what position you play Echo. What do you see?
[01:30:51] I was a lot smaller. You guys were hitting me. His only 185 back there. Oh my god.
[01:30:55] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Long time ago. Holy cow.
[01:30:57] Did you like eat a cornerback or something? Like, actually, it's so mean too.
[01:31:02] But yeah, like, even as like, you know, it's a wide receiver that they would make, you know,
[01:31:07] you know how it was. It was like, okay, this is your position. This is what we want you to be good at.
[01:31:12] But we're not going to focus you in in in the in seal training bro. It's like nobody cares how big you are.
[01:31:19] What position you play. It's like you're doing you're doing everything. You know, so
[01:31:25] those are the sports that the NSW director, it was trying to raise awareness.
[01:31:30] But you said seven sports. That's three. What were the other four? You remember?
[01:31:33] Yeah, I was like crew cross country. I think, look, cross.
[01:31:41] Cross. That's the water polo. Yeah. Yeah. So it was, but that's where we spent the most of our time on those three.
[01:31:51] And they would send what they called seal scouts around to those type of events in high school
[01:31:58] college. And we what we would do is we would show a video of like you can't you can't recruit a seal.
[01:32:02] If you have to talk somebody in to show it up to that and then they see it for real. They're like, no.
[01:32:08] I'm not doing this. So what we would actually try and do is just raise awareness like this is an
[01:32:14] option for you and then and then leave and then let them, you know, self select themselves into it.
[01:32:21] And so we go around the country doing that. So I did that for about a year and a half. And then
[01:32:25] got an opportunity to go to trade it and be in a more ops. Got a spot in VVSS and I started,
[01:32:34] you know, just learning from the guy who was the LPO at the time.
[01:32:38] Actually, got to go by his house last night and have a beer with him and have some dinner with them.
[01:32:42] But after that is when he left, he turned it over to me and I became the LPO of VVSS. And so
[01:32:48] honestly, that was the best training I got to go into entrepreneurship because, you know, as you know,
[01:32:55] like you you have like a hundred times more of this than I ever did. But I never got put in a
[01:33:03] leadership position like that where there were so many things that you had to account for, so many
[01:33:08] things that you were tracking on, making sure things are going to be in the right place. And then also
[01:33:13] when things don't go as planned, how do we flex, what do we do, what's the contingency. And so
[01:33:20] you know, that was a phenomenal opportunity for me because I was even running my small business,
[01:33:24] bottle breacher out of our one car garage in Point Loma while doing that and just working stupid
[01:33:30] hours. But you know, that was really helpful and you know, helping me learn how to be a better
[01:33:38] leader. But it was also cool to see to just, you know, being a part of being on the other side and
[01:33:45] watching, you know, the training cycle, how much goes into it and making sure that these guys are
[01:33:51] prepared when they go down right. So your teaching VVSS and you just mentioned this when you started
[01:33:55] ball breacher for the first time. Yeah. How did that come about? So it came about, I was actually,
[01:34:02] I knew I was getting out. I probably had, you know, two and a half years before my time was up,
[01:34:07] but I watched a lot of my buddies get out before me that had the same credential, same qualifications.
[01:34:13] I watched them struggle. Like to find something that they could actually sink their teeth into.
[01:34:19] And I knew that wasn't even an option for me because I had a daughter or two at the time.
[01:34:24] And so I was like, man, you got to figure this out. And so it was a little bit of fear that was driving me
[01:34:30] but also going back to that identity early on. Like, you know, I didn't want to, you know,
[01:34:38] one of the things that my brothers used to call me was a fuck up. They used to call me that all the time.
[01:34:43] And I'm not trying to throw F moms on your show. I know this is, you know, some kids listen to the show,
[01:34:48] but, you know, it is what it is. And so there was a part of me that, you know, still had that identity
[01:34:54] in the back of my mind, like, hey, well, maybe you got lucky and became a seal, but this is when you're actually
[01:35:00] going to show the world that you are, you know, that F up. And so, you know, not only did I not want to be that,
[01:35:09] but I also wanted to make sure that my little girls and my wife were provided for. So like, I was doing that,
[01:35:14] you know, the VBSS thing, the IPO thing and running bottle breacher at the same time, but the way it
[01:35:20] actually came about was I remember my little brother who is a Marine Corps pilot, he is a cober pilot.
[01:35:26] He went to the PI and at one of the outdoor markets there got a 50-calb on-lover and he brought it back
[01:35:33] and he gave it to me. And I was like, dude, what is this thing? It opened your beer? No way.
[01:35:38] Try it. Yep, sure enough it does. And I was like, dude, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[01:35:44] And so I put it in my junk drawer and then when my buddies would come into my house,
[01:35:48] like watch a UFC or something, they were like, dude, that is badass. Where can I get one?
[01:35:52] And I was always like, I don't know, man unless you go to the Philippines.
[01:35:56] But I started thinking about it and I was actually one up to LA for Thanksgiving
[01:36:01] that my family members were having up there. And I remember on the way back I was like, dude,
[01:36:06] that thing is cool, but it was real generic, just plain brass, all dinged up. And I was like,
[01:36:11] but it could be way better. And so I came back and I went into my garage and I spray painted it,
[01:36:17] black. And then I had bought a bunch of punishers stickers because I made platoon DVDs
[01:36:23] for my last platoon. And I took one of the little punishers stickers once the paint dried and I put
[01:36:29] it on there. And it was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god, this thing is insane.
[01:36:36] And so I took it to work. You know, the next, you know, the next day or so I showed it to my buddies.
[01:36:40] They were like, dude, this is maybe the coolest thing I've ever seen. Make me want. Make me five for
[01:36:46] every guy, my family. And so that's when the light bulb came on like this thing is cool, but it could
[01:36:51] be way better. And nobody that I knew of or any of my buddies knew of was selling them in the states.
[01:36:56] And so it was at that time my wife was she was running a couple online or want. She she had
[01:37:04] success with some online businesses, just small little online businesses like boutiques and stuff.
[01:37:10] But she knew how to work, you know, the store, the internet. And she graduated with a degree in, you
[01:37:15] know, business from U of A University of Arizona. So she was definitely had that part down where I was
[01:37:24] extremely weak. And I was like, babe, babe, do you think you can help me sell these online?
[01:37:29] She's like, oh, let me do some research and you know, I'll let you know. And so she comes back
[01:37:33] and she's like, yep, I know what we're going to do. She's like, we're going to sell them on Etsy.
[01:37:38] I'm like Etsy. What is Etsy? How about eBay or something I've heard of? And she's like, no, trust me.
[01:37:44] She's like, women shop on Etsy all the time. It's like an artisan, whatever, artisan, you know,
[01:37:51] website. And she's like, they will buy them for their men. And so we started them. And the first ones
[01:37:58] after that one that I already had. So I started buying dummy rounds online. And then I would, you know,
[01:38:05] I'd start practicing cutting them with a Dremel tool. You know, just like crawl, walk run, right?
[01:38:10] And that's what we used to say in the CO teams all the time. I was like, I just have to figure out.
[01:38:14] And I didn't know anything about manufacturing cutting metal. I was just a dude in the garage.
[01:38:18] And I don't know if I make that run. And so I cut like, I figured out how to get it down.
[01:38:25] And this was kind of cool. It would take me, it would take me about, I think, 25 minutes to cut one
[01:38:31] when I started. And they look like crap, but people still bought them. But then I started getting
[01:38:37] real square away with my manufacturing. And I realized, Draco, that the tip of my broom handle,
[01:38:43] that I cut off with a Dremel tool fit perfectly over a 50-cow round. So now I could make a fixture,
[01:38:49] my first fixture. And I cut, I cut the cut into the broom handle. And then I take a Sharpie marker.
[01:38:55] And I would actually draw the cut on there. So that, because it was taking me seven minutes,
[01:38:59] I time myself to actually like take a take measuring cloth, measure out all the, all the dots,
[01:39:04] then connect them. And then I would take my Dremel tool, put it in a vison cut-up. And so that was my first
[01:39:10] fixture. And then now, now we were, now we were cooking. And so they were, you know, they were still
[01:39:16] really rough. Like I would prime up, then I'd paint them. And then I was like, okay, if these team
[01:39:21] guys who, you know, get everything, you know, people think they're the coolest dudes in the world
[01:39:26] they're willing to buy them. Anybody would buy them. I just have to figure out, market it to somebody else.
[01:39:30] So I started thinking, okay, these are going to be big in the military units, firemen,
[01:39:35] cops, etc. And so I started buying stickers online. And I started painting them and putting
[01:39:40] stickers on them. And we would market them that way. And it was interesting because, you know,
[01:39:45] when you start selling stuff, typically you want to start your price point high,
[01:39:50] and then work down until you find somebody that'll buy it. And so I remember looking at
[01:39:53] what everybody else was doing. They were selling them, you know, like really generic cheap ones for
[01:39:58] like 20 bucks. And I'm like, I want to see if I can start buying it, like 28 and make more profit.
[01:40:04] And so I started at 28 crickets, nobody bought them. Brought it down, waited two weeks,
[01:40:09] brought it down to 24, 99, a couple people bought them. Oh, cool. Got our first sale. And then,
[01:40:15] you know, let it let it hang out there for a bit and then brought it down to where everybody else
[01:40:19] was boom, floodgates open, people are buying these things nonstop and, you know, we're in business.
[01:40:24] And so at that point, I just kept, you know, working it, working it, trying to improve, you know,
[01:40:30] our fighting position or the product found somebody that was an actual machinist that could cut
[01:40:35] them professionally, found a professional powder cutter that could put instead of putting paint on them.
[01:40:40] It actually like powder coat them and you just want to get one of the old snow,
[01:40:44] replace it with paint did one of those. That's what I wanted. My boy. I got like, I've got, like,
[01:40:49] probably a hundred bottle breaches from people give them to me. And we have some that we give away.
[01:40:57] Yeah. And so I have, but I want, I want one that's spray painted with the Narls cut that
[01:41:04] barely works. That's what I was. I saw one last night. Yeah. My boy, my boy, Mike,
[01:41:10] he was the LPO at VBSS before he passed the job over to me and he had, he, we broke out one of the
[01:41:18] old ones. I was like, damn, I was looking at the Dremel Cut Nixon, the crap I cut and I'm like,
[01:41:23] God, I can't believe it. But you know, honestly, I am big on my faith. And I remember that
[01:41:29] point in my life and I was definitely afraid of failing my family. And, you know, I was still
[01:41:35] seeking God in the things in my life. And I was praying. I was like, Lord, how do you want me to
[01:41:39] provide for my family when I get out of the military? And it was funny, man, when he's like,
[01:41:45] beer opens. Well, right, but here's the cool thing, man. You know, they are bottle openers and
[01:41:52] most people use them to open their beer. But, you know, the cool thing is, it's like, even something
[01:41:58] like that, if you give God the glory did, you'd be surprised. Some of the doors he will open
[01:42:03] in your life. So, you know, and it's just, it's crazy, man, because when I told people, especially
[01:42:10] maybe guys, they were like, you like, what are you going to do when you get out? I'm like, hey,
[01:42:15] I'm some of the bottle openers. Jockel, I'm surprised something didn't send me to you. There
[01:42:20] were like, yeah, that's probably not going to work out. And let's get this guy to a psychological
[01:42:26] evil ASAP. But it was cool because within six months, my original goal wasn't to build like a
[01:42:35] multi-million dollar business. It was like, hey, I want to make some extra money for a date and I
[01:42:40] or to save up for, you know, my next firearm or whatever, just some supplemental income. And then
[01:42:46] as it started growing, I was like, do this could be something. And six months into it, we were doing
[01:42:52] $7,500 a month, which blew me away. I never thought we'd even get there. And then at that point,
[01:42:58] I made one of the better moves that I ever made in business. And I sold my chopper. I had a
[01:43:04] motorcycle that I used to drive over to your gym and do the jutsu with. But, um, and I sold the chopper
[01:43:13] and I bought a laser, I took the funds and I bought a laser engraver. And that is when things just
[01:43:19] would be because I was watching an episode of Shark Tank. And, um, these the sharks were tearing
[01:43:27] apart in entrepreneur. Primarily Kevin O'Leary, who became one of my, um, investors. And he's
[01:43:32] he's ripping apart an entrepreneur because this guy, he had decent sales, he had a pretty cool
[01:43:37] unique product. But he had no brand recognition on the product. So like he had the brand on the packaging,
[01:43:44] but as soon as it left, that was the one who was the product. It was like a green neon suit that
[01:43:49] you would wear at a football game or like a ski, you know, like skiing or something, made you stand out,
[01:43:55] right? And the guy, Kevin and Marseille market for that.
[01:43:59] Or for a green neon suit, like a skin type suit, like Spambex suit. Exactly. Yeah. And so the guy had
[01:44:06] he was doing 300k in sales and you know, I've never seen a human in a green neon suit.
[01:44:12] I'd never seen one either, but he had this, he had the sales, he had the product there and
[01:44:17] Kevin, they were looking at it and Kevin's like, you know, he's like, is the brand on on this
[01:44:22] anywhere and the guy's like, no, he's like Kevin just starts ripping him up. He's like, this is the
[01:44:27] dumbest thing that you know, you can do as an entrepreneur. He's like, what if somebody's looking at it
[01:44:32] and outside the package and they want to know who made it, but they can't find your brand on
[01:44:36] there anywhere. They can't go Google it and look it up online. And so I was sitting on the couch
[01:44:41] with my wife Jen and we, because we had two small kids, I was in the Navy still and we were running
[01:44:46] bottle breacher. There wasn't a lot of free time, but we did allow ourselves like that was our,
[01:44:50] like, you know, one show that we'd watch together and I was like, babe, we got to figure out how to
[01:44:55] get boner breacher on each and every one of these units leaving the garage. And so I started
[01:44:59] doing some research which led me to laser engraving. And so I had about $30,000 in the bank from
[01:45:05] like a re-enlistment bonus and I was like, I don't work in the Navy. I don't want to risk, you know,
[01:45:10] our little nest egg on something and unknown, right? And so I was like, I'm going to sell my bike.
[01:45:16] And Cindy, it goes the best place in the world to have a motorcycle. I mean, just the best place.
[01:45:20] And so that was hard for me to do, but I later read Rich Dad Poor Dad with Robert Kisaki and he talks
[01:45:27] about all the time, you know, and he talks about his book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, what the Rich
[01:45:36] teacher kids at the Poor Don't. Basically, the summary is, you know, wealthy people teach their
[01:45:41] kids to buy assets, not lab abilities, right? Assets, something that makes you money,
[01:45:46] liability, something that cost you money. And I hadn't read the book at the time, but that was basically
[01:45:50] the move that I made. And, you know, by doing that, our sales went from $7500 at the six month
[01:45:58] mark to a month and a half later we were doing $22,000 a month out of that same one, Car garage.
[01:46:02] To the point where like, I couldn't keep up with it, I had to start like,
[01:46:05] moon, like bringing guys in from the military that were like, you know, doing whatever job
[01:46:10] and they'd have, they'd work in the garage and help me out. And then, you know, I think, you know,
[01:46:16] a year after that point we were doing $80,000 a month out of that one Car garage. And that's
[01:46:20] when I pitched a shark tank. And so you were still on that community when you pitched a shark tank?
[01:46:26] I was. Yeah, I was, I was right at the tail end. Okay. I was right at the tail end and there was
[01:46:31] an open casting called down here in like Miramesa. And I was sitting with one of my advisors in LA and he's
[01:46:37] like, you like, you got to get on that show. And so found it open casting call went down there.
[01:46:42] They were like, hey, first 500 people get to get to pitch to a casting member. And so I went
[01:46:47] gotten line at like one in the morning. I was like number one 25 and then, and then came back the next
[01:46:54] day once I got my little wristband badge and, you know, knocked it out of the park. And then they were
[01:47:01] like within a week. No, within that was on a Saturday Monday morning, they sent me an email.
[01:47:05] They said, hey, we loved your pitch. We need, you have one week to make a video. And I, you know,
[01:47:10] made the video. They loved it. We kept moving on. And it was funny because when you get in that
[01:47:16] process, they assigned you a couple producers and who are kind of coaching you through the process.
[01:47:21] And they were like, it was funny. Me and Jen would have to hop on the phone with them every Friday at
[01:47:26] like four p.m. to have like a conference call with them. How's the pitch going? Where you guys
[01:47:31] at in the process? And it was funny. They were always telling Jen what we would practice our pitch on
[01:47:36] the phone with these guys. And they were like, Jen, Eli is just not excited. You've got to get him
[01:47:41] excited. He sounds like he's not enjoying this. And I'm like, guys, I'm not a cheerleader. Like,
[01:47:46] when I need to get excited like all, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to rob rob rob ross
[01:47:51] just can borrow like I'm going to tell you, hey, this is what we're doing. These are what the sales are.
[01:47:55] This could be something. And but you, you got to keep in mind it's a TV show. So they want you to
[01:47:59] like, you know, they want you to be all. They want that drama, bro. I want that drama. Yeah.
[01:48:06] But anyway, we got, we got an opportunity to go on the show. And we, you know, it went really well
[01:48:12] and got two sharks. Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary. And you know, it just, it started blowing up
[01:48:20] and that created another, another leadership challenge to to work through. So then where,
[01:48:26] that once it came out, how much longer did you have in the Navy once the show came out?
[01:48:30] So I actually pitched on the show. I feel we were telling the seal commander this, but I was on
[01:48:39] terminal leave when I pitched. So that's legal, dude. Is it? Yeah, totally. Okay. Well,
[01:48:45] at least as far as I know. I've been out of the Navy now since what since 2014. So
[01:48:51] I, maybe there's a statute of limitations. Hopefully. But anyway, so yeah, I was on terminal leave.
[01:48:57] So I wasn't even going into work, but I went and pitched in LA. And then the show,
[01:49:04] the show actually aired the month after I got out of the Navy, my final, my final month
[01:49:10] in the Navy. So it was like perfect timing for us. And, you know, we started, we started working,
[01:49:16] you know, we started working, you know, the group back to Arizona. We, yeah, as soon as I could
[01:49:21] even, even on terminal leave, I moved my family back there as on a so. What did you get
[01:49:25] did you get a building for production? Like what did you do for that aspect? We did. We, we, we
[01:49:29] we rented space. We rented a couple different spaces. And we just ran it out of there. And it was
[01:49:35] interesting because when you go through that process, there's no guarantee that even if you go to
[01:49:42] LA and you shoot the show, there's no guarantee that your episode's even going to air. So this
[01:49:46] goes right back to kind of like the situation I talked about in my second time, taking those orders,
[01:49:52] coming back to Buds. It was a big risk because at that point we had like $70,000 in the bank
[01:49:58] in our business account. And I remember knowing that, you know, if this show airs, we need a lot more
[01:50:05] inventory, we need more machinery, we need to hire some people. But if it doesn't air, we just waste
[01:50:10] it all of our money. Or we're going to have to figure something out. And so we again, we went big,
[01:50:15] we gambled. We spent every last cent we had at my wife who ran the numbers, who's always around
[01:50:21] the numbers. She was like, hey, if this show doesn't air, we're not going to make payroll. You know,
[01:50:26] so thankfully, it aired when it was supposed to air. And you know, I think we did like $450,000
[01:50:33] that night of the airing. And that was, it would have been way bigger than that. But we got so much
[01:50:39] traffic on the website. I was told it was like 13,000 hits a second because it was like 12,
[01:50:45] 12 million people watching the show. And they were like the website crashed within seconds of an
[01:50:52] airing on the east coast. And so thankfully, one of the things that I learned in the teams,
[01:50:58] guys like Jaco was one is none to his one. Always have a backup. So we had a redundancy plan
[01:51:04] in place. We put up a banner on the website. Hey, go to Etsy. We still had our Etsy store. People were
[01:51:08] still able to buy there. And so we limped, limped through it. And then we were all like, yes, this is
[01:51:14] awesome, you know, great exposure, great sales. And then I'm like, now we have to make this stuff.
[01:51:21] Because we don't call it, it's not like we're calling China. Like you know, and so we were before
[01:51:26] shark team. We don't call it turnaround here. That's right. That's right. So we were making like 135
[01:51:32] bottle breaches on a good day before shark tank. I think when we woke up the next day, we had to
[01:51:36] make like 60,000 bottle breaches. And we had 20,000 emails to answer and like people are pissed off. Like this
[01:51:43] is the day and age, I am a zombie man. Like, where this little mom and pop shop that was like,
[01:51:48] we're not making with germaltols anymore. But I mean, we don't, we're not making them that fast.
[01:51:53] And so it created a real leadership challenge where, you know, that lesson of, hey,
[01:52:01] what we did yesterday, you can't say this is how we, we've always done it. Because how we've always
[01:52:05] done it and it ain't gonna work anymore. And we got to, we got to think outside the box, we got to
[01:52:08] get creative. And thankfully, I mean, it took me longer than I, I would have liked to have figured
[01:52:13] it out, but thankfully, we finally figured it out. Got things up on step and we're able to handle
[01:52:20] national television earrings and stuff like that. And so what year was that? That was 2014.
[01:52:26] How long did it take you to get caught up with 60,000? Making a 335 a day. Three months. Took, took us three
[01:52:33] months and people were pissed, man. The worst part is if some people somehow were finding market
[01:52:39] and Kevin's emails are shark tank investors and they're like, I can't believe you did a deal with
[01:52:44] this company. These guys are idiots, you're stupid. And like, at that point in my life, nothing
[01:52:51] was worse than getting an email from, you know, Mark Cuban, like WTF. You guys need to get this stuff
[01:52:58] straightened out. You know, it was just like, I mean, that's the type of thing that would just
[01:53:02] ruin your night. You know, but, you know, going back to, you just like working for Chris Kyle,
[01:53:06] dude, hey, that don't cut it anymore, man. You know, so I think it's been, I think it was a blessing
[01:53:13] and it's definitely prepared me for what I'm doing now. There's a, I watched, I watched the,
[01:53:19] they have a YouTube video that's like after the shark tank beyond the tank. Yeah, beyond the tank.
[01:53:25] And it was pretty cool. A lyrics, you know, he was talking about you and talking about veterans.
[01:53:30] You could see his a Patriotic guy who's getting like, he's getting choked up talking about what
[01:53:33] you guys were doing and just thankful for your service. So I thought that was, to me, that was
[01:53:38] awesome to see because I don't, I don't watch that show. Echo is like, uh, it's big time. Watcher of
[01:53:44] shark tank. Yeah. Did you watch this like when it happened? Life? Oh, you did, you did.
[01:53:48] My boy, dude. In the game, boy. In the game. Yes, over there. Well, yeah.
[01:53:54] Were you nervous before you walked out there? I lived a little bit, but I was more excited.
[01:53:59] I'm not gonna lie to you. I was a little bit nervous because you know, it's like, you know,
[01:54:02] that you're about to either be a hero or a zero on national television. And obviously, too, like,
[01:54:10] all those entrepreneurs, like, they have more, you know, business acumen in their fingers.
[01:54:15] And I did my entire body, but I knew we had something. And I knew that if we could just get on the show,
[01:54:21] obviously it was a controversial product because it was a bullet, you know, by the way. So I was worried
[01:54:26] about that, but it was funny because, um, one of the things that we'd rehears was we were going to
[01:54:31] get each shark their favorite beer. And then, um, you know, hand out the personalized bottle
[01:54:38] breaches that I'd made for each one of them. And then let them, you know, open their beer with it.
[01:54:42] And we're all gonna cheers and whatever. Well, um, last minute, the prop director, guy, he's like,
[01:54:48] hey, we're not gonna use their favorite beers or whatever. We're gonna use these beers that we have
[01:54:52] backstage. And I'm like, hey, you're called, you're show, whatever you guys want to do. And so I don't
[01:54:57] know if somebody was playing a joke on me or what dude, but I went and I, you know, took my bottle
[01:55:02] up, my bottle breacher, I breached it up. And this thing starts foaming all over the place. And I look at it.
[01:55:07] And I'm like, you know, this is like, they're opening their beers. I'm opening, you know, my beer.
[01:55:12] And I'm supposed to cheer up, you know, do the cheers thing. And I was such like, whatever dude.
[01:55:17] Sorry, I just, you know, you know, take a big swing of it. And it was funny because we started
[01:55:22] our pitch and Jen like leans over to me and she whispers to me. She's like, there's beer,
[01:55:28] there's foam in your mustache. And I was like, whatever dude. I just keep trying to make my
[01:55:34] right. Just keep going dude. So we did it, you know, and it was, it was a blessing. And I think
[01:55:40] it's led to, you know, so much, so much other stuff. But, you know, definitely isn't always
[01:55:46] roses. And one of the hardest things about it was working with my spouse. You know, I mean, you know,
[01:55:52] I hadn't even learned to barely live with my spouse at that point because I'd been gone a lot. And,
[01:55:59] you know, we were both kind of like type A's like button heads all the time. And it definitely
[01:56:04] took some learning to what we call staying your swim lane. You know, and like, you do what you do.
[01:56:11] I do what I do. And I'm, and trying not to sleep on the couch. It's been a lot of time sleeping on the
[01:56:16] couch. But, you know, I probably deserved it. So you're talking about the fact that, you know,
[01:56:22] like, with your faith with, you know, you basically a couple times in your life at critical times
[01:56:29] have been praying and saying, hey, look, if I'm supposed to go to Buds, open the door, if not
[01:56:34] close it, you know, I need a way to help my family. If I leave the Navy, open a door, I'm knocking.
[01:56:42] Let me in. Let me, let me, let me know what to do. Yeah. Serious guidance for you. Yeah, it was
[01:56:48] and it was interesting because after after the Shark Tank, and I know there's a spectrum here,
[01:56:56] and I try not to compare myself to other people. But I knew just by knowing myself,
[01:57:01] I knew I wasn't in a good spot mentally. Like, you know, done five deployments, and I got,
[01:57:10] I got now, and I felt this like anger in this rage inside me. And I tried to keep it under wraps
[01:57:17] because like, I, I didn't think it was cool. I didn't want, you know, people to know that like I was
[01:57:23] struggling with certain things. And, you know, and then all the stress of being a dad to young
[01:57:29] kids and, and then running this, running this business with your spouse who you just barely learned
[01:57:34] to, you know, work with. And so I felt like, you know, I was on the struggle bus. I felt like I was
[01:57:40] failing as a, as a husband in many ways, and even as a dad. And I was laser focused on this business,
[01:57:45] because I was like, took the same mentality from the seal teams. Like, hey, just go as hard as you
[01:57:50] can outflank your enemy, you know, stand up this team. And, you know, sometimes when your laser
[01:57:56] focused on something, you start dropping other important priorities. And when it really resonated
[01:58:02] with me, like the spot that I was in, probably, probably two years after Shark Tank, I think it was
[01:58:10] 2016, a buddy of mine here in San Diego who was in that VBSSL with me, just a good dude. I'm pretty
[01:58:19] sure he's still active. He was an e-dog and then got his commission. And he called me up and usually
[01:58:26] when he called me, it was just to talk shit to me. We called it Bander Therapy. We just, you know,
[01:58:32] tell each other how worthless they were. And we'd laugh about it. And then like it felt like you
[01:58:36] just did like, you know, an hour long intensive therapy session or something. And so I was like,
[01:58:43] oh, here we go. You know, his initials are KP, KP's calling. We're going to, we're going to get
[01:58:48] after each other and then, you know, just catch up see how he's doing. And I could tell immediately
[01:58:54] he wasn't calling to, you know, Bander Therapy, give me a hard time. And he's like, hey man,
[01:58:59] I got bad news. And I'm like, what's up, dude? And he's like, hey man, Chuck is dead. And I'm like,
[01:59:04] what? And he's like, yeah, Chuck is dead. He got killed fighting with the Peshmerga, you know,
[01:59:12] fighting nicest. I think it was yesterday or something. You know, like, I don't remember what else he
[01:59:18] said. But we got, we got off the phone and I was just in shock because Chuck,
[01:59:23] Keating, was one of my new guys at a SILTHING THREE and Delta Blotin. And like, like, I was
[01:59:29] like, as kind of a seed at, you know, like looked after him, just loved the kid, such a such a solid
[01:59:36] dude. And went on to become just a phenomenal seal. But it was, I noticed how I was in trouble because
[01:59:44] I remember walking out of bottle breacher and I didn't, like, I felt like I was getting ready to
[01:59:50] just break down. And I didn't want my staff to see me, you know, break down. I didn't think that
[01:59:54] would be professional. And I remember feeling it, like, I remember feeling the emotion come up
[02:00:01] from my stomach into my throat. And like, our cool, let's just get this out. And it just like stopped.
[02:00:07] And it wouldn't, like, I couldn't, I couldn't shed a tear, I couldn't cry. And this happened
[02:00:14] like, I started walking around the, the, the, the, the, the like mall that bottle breacher's
[02:00:21] buildings are located in. Happened like four or five times and I was like, oh damn, dude, that's kind
[02:00:26] of, that's kind of weird. And I've kind of, it was, it was, it was so weird that I started thinking about it.
[02:00:34] And that was the first time that I'd ever happened. And there had probably been, I don't know,
[02:00:39] to that point, probably 15, at least 15 guys that I knew that had been killed in war.
[02:00:46] And he was out of all of them, none of them were closer to me than him. And it was kind of,
[02:00:52] I was perplexed at why I couldn't mourn him. And so I started thinking about it. And there's a,
[02:00:59] there's a, there's a verse in Proverbs, 423, it says above all else guard your heart
[02:01:06] for, for from it flowed the springs of life. And I realized, I realized it not only had I not guarded my
[02:01:14] heart, but I had built massive walls around my heart to where I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't
[02:01:19] even feel, I couldn't even mourn like one of my best friends, it just got killed fighting ISIS.
[02:01:23] And I knew I was in trouble. And, uh, and the other thing I realized was that that wasn't
[02:01:30] an isolated incident, like it was affecting the, the springs of life that as a father and a husband
[02:01:38] that we're supposed to be flowing out of us so that we can love those around us, especially our
[02:01:44] spouses, our kids, that they were broke, man. That those walls that I built around my heart so that I
[02:01:51] couldn't be heard anymore, like it was affecting. It was keeping some of the arrows of life out,
[02:01:57] but it was definitely affecting that love that was supposed to be flowing out. And I just knew I was
[02:02:01] in trouble. And thankfully a buddy of mine named Rick who loves your show, by the way. He invited
[02:02:09] me to this, this men's retreat. And it was like a Christian men's retreat. And I was like, oh god,
[02:02:14] that sounds awful. Um, but, you know, he kept after me for a couple of years and it's called,
[02:02:21] it was called ransom art. It's called, you know, now it's called Wild It Heart, the guy that wrote
[02:02:26] the book while that hards a guy named John Eldridge. And he writes some phenomenal books, but
[02:02:32] finally I said, you know what, man? I want to be a better man. I want to be a better husband,
[02:02:36] a better dad and, and all of that. So I'm going to go with you. And so I went in, uh, I think it was
[02:02:40] 2017 and the event changed my life, man. And, uh, I think the biggest question, biggest questions most of
[02:02:48] us ask theologically are who am I? Why am I here? Why is a world so messed up? What can I do
[02:02:56] about it? And, uh, you know, I definitely got some answers to those questions. And it was cool,
[02:03:01] man. It wasn't like, there was no religion, you know, there was no churchy entity. You would think
[02:03:08] going to event like that, you'd be surrounded by a bunch of net flenders types, but it was just a
[02:03:12] bunch of regular dudes, um, who all came with the same questions that I had. And I think, and I think
[02:03:20] many of them were in the same spot that I was, they hadn't taken care of their heart. They hadn't
[02:03:24] guarded their heart. And, um, in the scripture, it also, um, I think it's 1 Peter 5, 5 8 says,
[02:03:33] be alert and of sober mind for your enemy, the devil, prowls the earth like a roaring line, looking
[02:03:39] for someone to devour. And I have seen a lot of men devour. I mean, we got 22 vets every day
[02:03:47] killing themselves. And that's just the states that report it. And that's just one, that's just one
[02:03:53] area of, of devouring going on. And, you know, it's like, I've always, and I know that not everybody
[02:04:02] believes the same things that I believe. I, I totally get that and I respect that. But I've always
[02:04:07] believed that if, like, if you, if you get something good, and you don't share it with other people,
[02:04:13] if you have a life altering experience, and you don't point others to it, that's pretty messed up,
[02:04:19] and you're not being a team guy at that point. And so I want to share that with people because
[02:04:24] I realize there's a lot of dads out there and a lot of husbands out there and a lot of, you know,
[02:04:30] vets out there and first responders out there that have a lot of questions and they're dealing
[02:04:33] with a lot of stuff. And like me, many of you have tried to like stuff it down like a beach ball
[02:04:39] under the water. And you can hold that beach ball down under the water for a couple of sec, you know,
[02:04:44] couple seconds, maybe even a minute if you're strong like echo over here. But sooner later, man,
[02:04:49] I think it's coming up. And if you don't take care of it, it's going to explode and usually on
[02:04:55] the people that you love the most. Was there, was there, like concrete actions that you took when
[02:05:04] you got home from the retreat? Yeah, there were. The first thing I did was I apologize to my wife,
[02:05:11] the very first thing because I realized just, and this goes back to extreme ownership now.
[02:05:21] I realized how many just how many ways I had failed her, you know, and how she needed me.
[02:05:28] She needed, she needed me to fight for her and off the time. I was so proud, Jaco, and so screwed
[02:05:34] up in so many ways. It half the time I couldn't even apologize to her if I screwed up, man. And I was
[02:05:40] broken and, you know, I needed, I needed fixing. And one of the first things that you need in that
[02:05:46] situation is to realize, hey, man, I'm broken and it's okay to get help. It's okay to seek it out.
[02:05:53] And that's not how team guys are trying to thought. We're taught to BTF, Charlie Mike,
[02:05:59] figured out, keep moving forward. You know, and we're not, we're not, we try and stay away from
[02:06:05] medical. We try and stay away from any of the touchy, feely, emotional stuff because we got stuff to
[02:06:13] do. And that stuff typically not helpful, but I can tell you after going to that, going through
[02:06:20] that ministry and I've been many times now over the last several years, but my marriage, I never
[02:06:26] thought my marriage would be great. I actually have a great marriage now, man. And so much of it was
[02:06:32] because I was equipped to not go back into my own story and get some healing, but also get some
[02:06:40] tools on how to move forward. And just understand the the bigger perspective of this story that we
[02:06:47] live in, man. And you know, it's like one of the things they teach there is that you were given a
[02:06:52] masculine heart for a reason, because you were born into a world at war. And I think a lot of the
[02:06:58] stuff that we see in society has spiritual undertones and foundations to it. And if you don't,
[02:07:03] like if nobody ever teaches you that stuff, man, it's kind of like getting shot at from,
[02:07:10] and you have no idea where you're getting shot at from. There's a lot. I think there's a parallel
[02:07:14] there, but the first thing I did was apologize to my wife. And the second, one of the second things
[02:07:20] that there's another scripture in it, forgive me. I don't remember exactly which one it is,
[02:07:25] but the scripture is I stand at the door and I knock and whoever hears my voice and opens the door,
[02:07:31] I will come in and eat with him and he with me. And that's what I needed, man. I just, I just
[02:07:37] prayed and I gave it up and I said, Lord, I'm broken. I'm hurting on the inside. And I'm inviting you
[02:07:43] into calm, rip all this stuff out of my life and my heart that I don't need that's dragging me
[02:07:49] down and that's not helpful to my family, to those that even trusted me to love and take care of.
[02:07:56] And I need your help and it kind of goes from trying to do it on your own to being like, hey,
[02:08:02] Lord, come in here and help help me with that. And I say that respectfully, man, because again, I know
[02:08:08] that a lot of people don't see things the way I do or feel this, feel the same way, but again,
[02:08:13] I'm not trying, I'm just trying to help other people because I know there's a lot of dudes out there
[02:08:17] asking the same questions that I was asking and they want relief and they want to be well
[02:08:24] and they don't know how to do it. Yeah, well, there's like a route to humility that you're talking
[02:08:32] about and there's a bunch of different routes to humility and I was actually thinking about that
[02:08:37] earlier today, you know, like the one of the, one of the founding tenants of Christy
[02:08:43] Anity is, hey, I'm going to put God above myself. Well, that's, that's, that's humility. To put,
[02:08:52] you know, I, I talk about humility oftentimes from a leadership perspective, you put the team
[02:08:56] above yourself. You put someone else's plan above your own plan. That's, that's a form of humility
[02:09:02] and extreme ownership is, you can't be, you can't take ownership without being humble enough to say,
[02:09:08] oh, this, this, this, this problem was my fault. So I think, you know, the, the route that you take to
[02:09:16] get to a point where you can say, okay, I'm going to be humble. I'm going to look at my life and say,
[02:09:21] hey, hey, wife of 10 years. I'm sorry that I haven't been as good as I can, right? That what,
[02:09:29] what it takes to get you there is, you can, you can take a bunch of different paths to get there,
[02:09:35] but humbling yourself, whether it's before God, whether it's before your team, whether it's before
[02:09:41] your wife and saying, hey, I know I can do better. That's a path that is going to help anybody.
[02:09:48] And, and I think how you get there, there's a bunch of different ways and the result is going to,
[02:09:54] is going to bring you to an area where you are going to find improvement. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree.
[02:09:59] It did not definitely needed to be humbled, you know, and all the guys that are a part of that,
[02:10:06] you know, that ministry, John, Morgan, Bart, man, thank you guys so much for everything you've done.
[02:10:13] Because I know it's not just me, I know that they've helped thousands of dudes through it. And
[02:10:17] if you guys want to go check it out, just go look up, you know, while they're heart,
[02:10:20] I think it's wild at hard.com or whatever, but man, wow, just a life changing experience for me.
[02:10:28] And it really, I went from wanting to build the biggest baddest veteran-owned company in the,
[02:10:33] you know, in the United States to, you know, wanting to focus on my family more.
[02:10:38] And, and also just coming back to, okay, God, you know, you've blessed me with so much.
[02:10:45] How do you want me to spend the rest of my life? Where do you, where do you want me to be?
[02:10:49] What do you want me to, you know, be doing? And now, now here I am, and, you know, doing something
[02:10:56] that I never ever thought I'd be a part of. But I think that's what happens when often you
[02:11:01] turn it over and be like, whatever you want me to do, just open the door. And if you don't want me
[02:11:06] to do it, please shut the door, you know, but I definitely want to spend the rest of my life trying
[02:11:13] to help, you know, help people and, and guide them towards, you know, concrete stuff that actually
[02:11:19] help me. And through that idea of serving, here you are now running for Congress, and Arizona.
[02:11:30] Yeah. What, what? I mean, that's just a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, a massacistic move,
[02:11:38] right, to go and just open up your life, give away your time, give away your privacy, give away
[02:11:45] any semblance of civility from other human beings. Right. And, and here you are, you know,
[02:11:53] you're going for it. Yeah. I am. And, you know, I think we're off, we're off to a good start.
[02:12:02] But I went into this knowing that there was a good chance that, you know, the, the outcome that many
[02:12:09] people, including myself are, are striving towards will not, there's a, there's a, there's a decent
[02:12:14] chance that that outcome will not become a reality. But at the end of the day, I focus on what I can
[02:12:22] control. I focus on a focus on your posture, Eli, don't focus on the outcome. Continue to try and
[02:12:30] be a man of honor and integrity and, and, and more importantly, be a guy that's willing to say,
[02:12:37] okay, I, I may not have all the experience in the world. I may not even be the best candidate,
[02:12:42] but this country is in massive trouble. It's in massive trouble. And I'm willing to go
[02:12:48] serve again. And if you, you all don't want to send me, I'm cool with that. If I'm not, if not,
[02:12:53] if I'm not a good enough candidate, I'm cool with that. What I'm not cool with is sitting on my couch
[02:12:58] complaining about it and yelling at my TV. And I'm not going to be okay. I like to, I don't know if
[02:13:03] you do this, Shaco, but I like to think about sometimes, you know, from a legacy building perspective,
[02:13:09] like, like, I like to think about my funeral, like, who's going to show up? Who's not going to show up?
[02:13:15] What's my, what are people going to say about me when I'm gone? Are they even going to be talk? Are
[02:13:19] they even going to, are they even going to talk about me? Or, or bring up my name and, you know,
[02:13:24] I'm, I'm hoping that at the end of my life, people show up to my funeral and be like, you know what?
[02:13:31] Eli did some, you know, Eli was good dude. And he loved, he loved people, and he wasn't willing,
[02:13:38] or he was, he was willing to sacrifice and serve something bigger than himself. And if, if that's what
[02:13:44] people say about me when I'm dead and gone and six feet under, then to me, I've lived a purpose driven
[02:13:52] life, something that I can be proud of. And to me, that's, that's what this is all about. It's like,
[02:13:57] you and I swore an oath to protect into the fin this country from foreign and domestic threats.
[02:14:03] And right now, I don't, I don't know how you see it. I believe we have some very dangerous foreign
[02:14:09] threats out there, but I think the biggest threats in this country right now are within and the fact
[02:14:15] that we can't, we can't unite and we can't, we have a lot of forces working against this,
[02:14:22] who I don't believe actually want to see a free and prosperous people that still have the power
[02:14:30] where our government is of foreign by the people. But there's a dichotomy to that.
[02:14:37] We have, we're so free and so prosperous here that many of us have become complacent.
[02:14:44] We've checked out. We don't think that we have to participate. And you can't have both. You can't
[02:14:49] have a government and a country that's of foreign by the people and have a complacent people
[02:14:54] that have checked out and don't participate. And I think that's one of the reasons we're in the
[02:14:58] spot that we're in because people don't want to deal with the negativity that goes along with politics.
[02:15:03] They don't want to deal with the nastiness. I totally get it. But that's one of the reasons
[02:15:09] we're in such a bad spot because we just think that we can elect these, these individuals who
[02:15:15] look good and they sound good. They put on the suit with the little flag on the on the collar.
[02:15:20] Tell us what we want to hear and then we leave it up to them and then when they let us down,
[02:15:24] we're like, oh well, I guess there's nothing we can do. No, there is something we can do.
[02:15:32] We can get involved and we can fight for it and that's what it's going to take honestly.
[02:15:39] Was there any issues that was there like a straw that broke the camels back where you said,
[02:15:46] I got to go. I got to do this. Yeah, there was and it was this last election in 2020.
[02:15:55] For so for so many different reasons, it was part the election. What I saw happened in the election,
[02:16:01] but then it was also watching people that I thought were actually eyes wide open,
[02:16:10] willing to fight for us. Do this number. They look left. They look right. Oh,
[02:16:15] I guess nobody else is saying anything. I'm just going to get back in line and you know,
[02:16:20] do my thing and make sure that I don't put myself out there and jeopardize my future political
[02:16:27] career. And so that was that was the big one for me because I believe that there was massive
[02:16:35] fraud in this last election for a bunch of different for a bunch of different reasons.
[02:16:40] At the end of the day, if we have a government that's of buying for the people and yet our elections
[02:16:46] aren't tight and we're not electing. We're no longer electing our officials.
[02:16:52] We're in massive massive trouble and the clock then starts ticking on how long in my opinion we actually
[02:17:01] last. And so I've said this before I'll say it again. I would rather we not. I would rather my guy
[02:17:09] lose or whoever I'm voting for lose, then we don't have to even question. Hey, how legit was that?
[02:17:18] Because I didn't look right over there and that didn't look right. And what about this over here?
[02:17:22] Oh, we're not allowed to talk about this or we'll get kicked off of social media too. Okay.
[02:17:26] Yeah, that doesn't smell right. How about if we have if we the people want to actually audit
[02:17:35] and check the results of our election? What is that look like? Is it welcomed or is it
[02:17:44] or do lawsuits start flying? There's been some interesting stuff going on that are similar
[02:17:52] to what you're talking about. So Jill Rogan, who's I have to explain who Jill Rogan is?
[02:18:00] No, no. Okay. So Jill had these doctors on, talk about COVID and these are doctors that have
[02:18:12] a non-mainstream media view about COVID. And he just released a statement yesterday because now we have
[02:18:19] some of these old rock and roll people telling Spotify if you don't pull Jill Rogan off,
[02:18:24] then we don't want our music off and that's a legitimate thing. So it's like, okay.
[02:18:34] So Rogan came out, he released like a nine minute podcast last night.
[02:18:38] I happen to be driving and when it came out, so I listened to it. And so this is what's interesting.
[02:18:44] I forget the examples that he gave, but one of them was six months ago or a year ago or whatever,
[02:18:52] if you said cloth masks don't do anything, you would be literally banned and there's documented
[02:19:00] people that were banned from social media for saying that. And now it's, oh, it turns out it's
[02:19:06] actually true. And for example, CNN has been widely reporting that. There's a whole list of things
[02:19:13] like that. Oh, here's, here's the, another example is, if you were to say six months ago or a year ago,
[02:19:22] once you're vaccinated, you can't catch COVID and you can't spread COVID. And if you would have said
[02:19:28] that, there's people that were banned from social media for saying those things. And now you look
[02:19:34] up and those things are actually true. They're factually true. That's what's happening. And you get this
[02:19:41] with the, with the election results that you're talking about in 2020. There's, when people said,
[02:19:51] hey, I'm not sure about this election. Right. Some people weren't necessarily saying,
[02:19:56] I mean, there was politicians, there was very few politicians that were saying, hey,
[02:20:01] not so sure about this. Maybe we should hold off. Maybe we should check the results.
[02:20:06] There was personality, social media personalities that were saying that. And they, they got
[02:20:12] shut completely shut down. Right. Not for saying, hey, I think we should overthrow the government.
[02:20:17] But for saying, hey, don't you think we should confirm this because I agree with you that
[02:20:23] to me, the worst outcome for an American election is people look at it and go, I don't believe it.
[02:20:32] Right. Even if it's, even if it's never mind half the populate, I don't want 10% of the
[02:20:38] population to think, hey, I don't believe this is true. I think that that, I think that the
[02:20:44] election results were wrong. I think there was foul play. All those things. What I want to do is,
[02:20:50] if 10% of the people say, or 1% of the people say, hey, we think that there was foul play in the
[02:20:56] elections. I want to say, okay, well, let's get everything out in the table. You know, a good
[02:21:04] analogy would be if you're watching, if you're playing a football game. Yeah. And, you know, a team,
[02:21:10] we think a team got to touch down. And, and the other team says, yeah, that wasn't a touch down.
[02:21:16] You don't say, well, shut up. It was because now we all leave and we don't really think they
[02:21:20] want to. We argue about it. We fight about it. And it's a bad thing. Instead, what do we do? What
[02:21:24] do we do nowadays when there's that problem? We solve the problem by going, oh, you don't think it was a
[02:21:30] touch down? Cool. We're going to go to the video tape. We're going to lay everything out on the table.
[02:21:35] And then everyone can see, oh, yeah, cross the plane. It was a touch down or didn't cross the plane.
[02:21:42] That's it. We can solve the argument so that we actually get the truth out there. And, and it seems
[02:21:49] like with this election, instead of saying, hey, here's what happened in these situations.
[02:21:58] Here's these anomalies that took place. Here's why they took place. Here's the impact that they
[02:22:03] have actually had. Here's some characters that did some things that they shouldn't have done.
[02:22:09] Here's some things that some accusations were made that were totally false. Right.
[02:22:12] But, but to just say, oh, if you don't think that that election was perfect, then you should be
[02:22:24] silenced. And, and the reason I bring up the the the masks and the vaccines is because
[02:22:33] right now, it seems like there are some people that are gathering evidence about the election
[02:22:39] that might not necessarily turn the election over. But they might at least say, hey, this is
[02:22:47] something that happened. This no one no one agrees that this should happen. No one agrees that someone
[02:22:52] should be stuffing ballot boxes, right? No one no one thinks she's been stuffing ballot boxes.
[02:22:56] So if ballot boxes are getting stuffed, what can we do to prevent that? And to me,
[02:23:02] I can't imagine an American that's aligned with America. Like with just the the broad idea of
[02:23:13] America where we have freedom of speech, where the right to bear them said, the bro we have the right
[02:23:18] through life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I can't imagine someone saying, you know,
[02:23:22] I actually think stuffing ballot boxes, okay? I actually think these changing these election laws
[02:23:28] I think that's fine as long as you know it's done for the right party. That to me doesn't make sense.
[02:23:35] So I think when you start talking about the thing that kind of pushed you over the edge,
[02:23:41] I think there's a lot of people that felt that way. Yeah. And honestly,
[02:23:47] there's a long there's a long list of things that I've been watching for years, but,
[02:23:51] you know, I like for instance, you look at this, look at this other board at, right?
[02:24:00] We're getting ready right now to possibly, you know, go send troops over to Ukraine on the eastern,
[02:24:06] their eastern border and yet we don't even take care of our own border, right? We have
[02:24:11] Fittin' all and drugs coming over that southern border. We have human trafficking coming over that
[02:24:16] southern border. You know, we're basically supporting the cartels by doing that. We have MS-13
[02:24:25] gang members coming over that southern border and you have an administration right now that doesn't
[02:24:29] even want to address that problem at all. They're actually taking people in the dead of night
[02:24:34] sometimes and flying them around the country. Right? You had a situation where border patrol agents
[02:24:39] were being fired because they wouldn't take a vaccination yet. People that were coming here
[02:24:44] illegally weren't forced to take a vaccination and then flown all over the country in the dead of night
[02:24:49] so that UNI wouldn't know about it, wouldn't see about it, et cetera. Those are facts as well.
[02:24:56] And so that's just one more issue. How about our debt situation? You've got like close to $30 trillion
[02:25:04] in debt, right? Right now you have Nancy Pelosi and others pushing spending bills that are going
[02:25:13] to continue to rack up that debt and we don't even have the money to pay for it. We're just printing
[02:25:19] money and basically we're devaluing the US dollar and we're causing inflation to skyrocket and
[02:25:28] you have Democrats like the guy I'm running against, guy named Tom O'Hallor and who will try and
[02:25:33] convince you that inflation, it's not that bad or it's, you know, I've even heard in the media
[02:25:39] they'll say, well, Jen Socky said, well, you know, it's an upper class problem, you know,
[02:25:46] and it's like people that are putting gasoline in their cars, people that are buying
[02:25:52] hamburger meat or any of the consumer products that we buy, those prices are going up and up
[02:26:00] and it affects everybody and this idea that we can just print our way out of this mess that we've
[02:26:06] gotten ourselves in because we don't have any fiscal responsibility and we have politicians that want to
[02:26:12] support of, you know, a spending bill so that they can go back to their constituents and say,
[02:26:16] oh, hey, look, I just got you guys, you know, great broadband, you know, wifi or whatever it is,
[02:26:23] but knowing deep down that there were, you know, a thousand other things in that bill that
[02:26:28] wasn't good for the country but now they can come back to hold this trophy up and be like,
[02:26:32] look what I did for you guys, you know, all across the board, how about energy?
[02:26:39] You know, we went from actually having so much energy that we were exporting energy.
[02:26:44] We shut down the Keystone XL pipeline and now we and we greenlit the Russian pipeline at the same time.
[02:26:52] Right. So how's that good for America? We're talking about defunding police officers.
[02:26:58] Are you, are you, what, what, what, what, what, what, what universe are we living in, right,
[02:27:03] where that's a good idea, you know, and I like Jaco, what you've been talking about, hey,
[02:27:07] how about we get, get some of these, you know, police officers, some better training, right?
[02:27:12] I think that's great, but defunding him, ain't gonna help anything. It's gonna, it's gonna hurt
[02:27:18] people and it's gonna hurt people, and it's gonna hurt people, lower class people and minorities,
[02:27:21] more than anybody else. So we've got this country has gone so, in my opinion, it's gone so far backwards
[02:27:28] and so many different, and so many different ways that I look around and one of my favorite
[02:27:32] sayings of all time is evil times when good men do nothing. And so again, it's just like,
[02:27:38] I'll tell you what, if there was, you know, if, if you were running into my district,
[02:27:42] I wouldn't be running into this district, bro. I wouldn't, and matter fact, I'm gonna put you on the
[02:27:47] spot right now. I, because I know I'm not the only one that has asked you,
[02:27:51] Gavin Newsom, there aren't too many guys that could take him out. You could take him out,
[02:27:58] dude, and I know you're building your empire, but I want to put that on your brain, bro,
[02:28:02] because you could take him out. I know you could, yeah, um, I don't think about, like,
[02:28:09] think about the platform that you have, think about your, your reputation and the seal teams.
[02:28:15] Think about what, what you've done as an entrepreneur, and at, at the same time, you've managed to
[02:28:21] keep your family intact, bro. That's, that's big time. I don't know another, I don't know
[02:28:27] another human being that has that all under one roof, man. And so I know you got stuff to do,
[02:28:34] I know you're working on stuff, but you could take him out. You could,
[02:28:43] evil times when good men do nothing, man. And I, and I hate to even, I hate to even put you on the
[02:28:48] spot because nobody's done, nobody deserves to like enjoy the American dream more than you have,
[02:28:54] just with everything you've done. But this is an inflection point in this country. That's why
[02:28:58] echo, that's why you see seven Navy SEALs running right now. Because it wasn't like, hey,
[02:29:03] it wasn't like we got on a conference call. Like, hey, you know, it'd be cute, because if we all
[02:29:08] ran for content, no, no, everybody, they all realized it. I know you, I know you feel it as well,
[02:29:13] but you know, how bad I saw that beat at Al Jaco, you know, the governor of California.
[02:29:21] Yeah. And and look, I appreciate you. Your input on that one.
[02:29:29] I really don't want to go into politics. That being said, I, you know what's interesting is,
[02:29:37] you know, I talked on my friends at live in Texas, they live in Utah, and they live in Montana,
[02:29:42] and they live in Arizona, and you know, there's just been a rash of people leaving California.
[02:29:48] Businesses leaving California. My friends, a bunch of my friends have left California,
[02:29:54] and I love California. California is freaking awesome. It is California has the Pacific Ocean.
[02:30:03] It has the mountains. It has the desert. It has the redwood trees. It has the Ocemedi. It is a
[02:30:08] magnificent place. It is absolutely magnificent. And yeah, it is in a very
[02:30:17] precarious situation right now that I don't think it can, I don't think it can, I don't think it can
[02:30:24] can you go this way. I mean, you, you've seen the news. You've seen the, the homeless situations.
[02:30:32] Yeah. You see the, the trains that we're getting attacked and, you know, robbed from entire free
[02:30:42] trains. I don't know what's going to happen, man. I don't know what's going to happen in California.
[02:30:48] I, I love California. California is an iconic place, and there's, and the other thing
[02:30:56] you got about remember about California is California is not San Francisco and Los Angeles. That's
[02:31:02] not California. Right. That's a small part of California. California is the Imperial Valley. Right.
[02:31:09] California is the agriculture that is the vast majority of this state and hard working Americans
[02:31:17] that are out there busting their ass to make things work. And at the same time, painting incredible
[02:31:23] amount of taxes and having the regulatory environment that's, that's hostile to business, legitimately
[02:31:30] hostile. Right. So with all these things as they continue to add up, I can't predict the future.
[02:31:38] I certainly hope I don't have to get into politics. I, I really just don't know if I have the
[02:31:43] stomach for it. I don't want to do it, man. And, and it's like just the biggest cop out that I can
[02:31:52] throw back at you at this point and, and you and the rest of the guys that are out there
[02:31:57] trying to do it for the right reasons is awesome. Um, man, I don't, I don't want to get into that
[02:32:04] business. I don't want to get into that world. And, you know, when people ask me about politics,
[02:32:10] I always tell them that, you know, I'm not, I don't want to do it unless things can really bad.
[02:32:13] And people hit me up all the time. Is it bad enough yet? Is it bad enough yet? Is it bad enough yet?
[02:32:19] I don't know where that line is for me. I feel a dumb and dumber moment coming on right now.
[02:32:26] Or I just want to say, so you're saying there's a chance. There's a chance. Okay. One at a million.
[02:32:34] Awesome. Uh, don't like it. Um, no, I hear you. I hear you. It's an, it's nasty, man. It's a nasty
[02:32:41] world in its, a caddude. And I, I'm barely even scratching the surface of it, but even now, like,
[02:32:48] I, I don't really like the world. I don't like the self-promotion of going around campaigning
[02:32:53] and telling people why you're so great and why they should vote for you. I don't like that part of it.
[02:32:57] I don't like the nastyness of, you know, people lying, lying about you and trying to smear you
[02:33:03] and, you know, every single way possible and if they can't come up with anything good, they'll just
[02:33:08] make it up. I don't like that part of it. I don't like exposing my family, you know, to this stuff as
[02:33:13] well, I just want my kids to grow up, kind of like a normal life. And, but I'll tell you what, man. It's like,
[02:33:20] if enough of us don't do it, we're done. Yeah. That's the way I see it, man. And I wish I was more
[02:33:26] optimistic, but I watch, like, just like on a, you know, a dope sheet as a sniper man, I watch
[02:33:32] trajectories. I watch where this country started, and more we're at now, man. And it's, I mean, COVID,
[02:33:38] if that doesn't wake people up, you know, to, you know, the fact that often, most often,
[02:33:45] governments aren't typically interested in letting the power rest with the people,
[02:33:51] I don't know what's going to wake people up, but it's, it's getting bad, and we need to,
[02:33:58] we need some sled dogs to put their, uh, and maybe a couple leaders to put their, uh, their
[02:34:04] shoulder to the wheel, but just saying, am I the only one that's ever called him out on, I don't think so
[02:34:10] now. I will say when I speak, maybe not necessarily on the podcast, because it's a small group
[02:34:16] of two or maybe three. Yeah. So yeah, whenever I go and talk to businesses, companies or
[02:34:21] organizations, I'm getting called out almost 100% of the time to get in the game, to get in that
[02:34:27] game, you know, and, and right now, I mean, part of my cop out, part of my, uh, uh, rationalization
[02:34:37] is, you know, I'm trying to build businesses in America, American made business, we're bringing
[02:34:42] manufacturing, we're putting people back to work, we got hundreds of employees, American employees
[02:34:47] that are, that are making things happen. We're, we're bringing back manufacturing. That's, that's,
[02:34:53] it is a part, it's, it is a part of the fight. It's a very important part of the fight. And honestly,
[02:34:58] that's why I'm an America first candidate, not because I, not because I hate, you know, any, any
[02:35:04] other country around the world, but I love this country, and it's for so long, so many of our
[02:35:08] leaders and politicians have put America on the back burner, and they've sold out so many,
[02:35:13] you know, of our workers, our constituents, and it's just like, hey, you know, I'm off
[02:35:18] for, I'm off for, you know, free trade, but it needs to be fair, and we need to make sure that
[02:35:23] we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and shooting, you know, you know, displacing our work
[02:35:28] for us and taking manufacturing away from many of these folks and families that, you know,
[02:35:33] count on it. And that was one of the coolest things about bottle breaches. I couldn't have even
[02:35:38] done it this long. I couldn't have even run that business this long. If I didn't find a way to
[02:35:43] incorporate mission into it. Okay. How do we, how, how is this bigger than just profits and
[02:35:49] balance sheets and okay, so we can support some cool veteran nonprofits, we can hire some vets,
[02:35:55] we can make our products in the USA. Okay. That's enough of a mission to keep me, you know, engaged,
[02:36:01] you know, for a certain amount of time, but, you know, and I love that you're doing that as well,
[02:36:06] man. It seems like it's getting hard to keep up with all this stuff you're doing. Well,
[02:36:11] you, you tell you, you tell you how I'm a bigger challenge, man. You tell you how I'm a bigger
[02:36:14] challenge. So how can everyone help out? How can we help get you elected? Where do we gotta do?
[02:36:21] Yeah. All right. So I appreciate it, man. I just appreciate the opportunity to come and wrap with you,
[02:36:27] guys. If people want to go follow me, they can look up Eli, Eli Crane, underscore CEO on social media.
[02:36:36] If you want to go to my website, it's Eli for Arizona.com. I hate to even ask, but unfortunately in
[02:36:44] this world, so much of this boils down to name ID and for a first time guy in a political race,
[02:36:51] a US Congress race, so much of it is going to come down to do we have the ammo and the resources
[02:36:57] to run all the TV ads, all the digital ads, all the mail ads, et cetera. So if you guys can give us
[02:37:03] a small donation, we would really appreciate it. I'm asking people for prayer as well. You know,
[02:37:09] just for guidance direction and wisdom. And the other thing I'm asking for is that people share,
[02:37:15] you know, share the website, share what we're doing here, so that other people that don't know about it
[02:37:20] can pitch in and help you, so those are the things that you guys can do. Sounds like a plan and
[02:37:28] probably a good place to wrap it up, Eko. You got any questions? We got football questions,
[02:37:33] whatever. I don't want to keep us here too much actually. No, I just actually want to say,
[02:37:38] so when I when we saw the Shark Tank episode, you know how like because you guys watch that
[02:37:44] even before you're on. You know the kind where someone comes out with a product or service,
[02:37:48] and you, you mean it depends on who you are, obviously. And you immediately know like,
[02:37:53] all this guy's going to get a deal. That's why I felt about yours. Because Brad, he but you don't
[02:37:57] want Shark Tank. I've watched it. I mean, I watched your episode over the past like a few days
[02:38:02] when I knew you were coming out here, but no, I'm not a regular watcher. Well, I'm like a bunch of
[02:38:06] other people that moment I saw that thing as a, I was like, did you know what I think about? Did you
[02:38:11] know you lie before that? No, I did. This was back in the days, like in 2014. Yeah.
[02:38:16] Um, but Brad, once I saw that thing, I was like, Brad, that's the cool issue that I ever seen.
[02:38:21] Yeah. You're that guy, bro. Oh, yeah. You're that guy that you was talking about.
[02:38:25] No, dude. I mean, it was so, it was so cool and such a blessing man. And I mean, it's still,
[02:38:31] I tell people all the time, you know, guys don't really grow up. We just get bigger toys.
[02:38:37] Can I tell, can I tell the Southern Franco story? Oh, yeah, it's a real hell of a thing. All right,
[02:38:41] so it's so fun, man. You know, Jaco is who Jaco is, man. And, you know, you got, got people that want to be
[02:38:47] like Jaco, right? And it just so happened that a lot of people, you know, and in task unit two,
[02:38:53] wanted to be like Jaco. So they made us, the older guys made the younger guys do skits.
[02:38:58] And that's a pretty dicey situation, man, because by the way, I know I know where a style
[02:39:02] lives right now. Yeah. I know where he's at. So I might have to go get him. So he's coming, bro. No,
[02:39:08] it wasn't even making fun of you. Really, it was just he was making fun of people that wanted to be like you.
[02:39:15] And so it was funny. So they make you do these skits. And if you piss him off, you know, you deal with,
[02:39:20] you deal with that side of it. But if you make them, if you can make them laugh, while making fun of them,
[02:39:25] that's the, the golden ticket, right? So South was always the funniest dude. So South came up with
[02:39:31] a lot of our skits. And so I remember he did this skit and it was like he was playing you. And
[02:39:39] or no, he was playing, I think he's playing Stoner. And he had this, he had this note, like this
[02:39:44] note, this binder, and he put like, what was it? WWE JD, what would Jaco do? And he like walks out
[02:39:52] playing Stoner, talking like Stoner. He's like, you know, all the acronyms, BTF, Charlie might,
[02:39:57] you know, the guys are just rolling because he's, you know, he's like, you know, making fun of all these
[02:40:02] guys who want to be like Jaco. But our failing misery, and it was just, it was just so funny dude.
[02:40:07] And so, you know, that, that became, you know, a joke, you know, running joke after you left, like,
[02:40:13] got to do all these guys walking around, what would Jaco do? Try to be like, bro, you're not
[02:40:17] Jaco, just be yourself, man. Okay, just be yourself. Big tough frog man, you know,
[02:40:23] our 200 pound ball, all the stuff. Hey, what's Charlie Mike? Continue mission. Oh, yeah.
[02:40:30] It's just another one. And it, and it's an unofficial thing, meaning our status is, this time
[02:40:37] is that we are going to Charlie Mike, meaning it's an unofficial thing, like, we are actually
[02:40:40] continuing to mention, but that turns into just like a, they just Charlie Mike, bro, right? You just
[02:40:45] got to just keep going. BTF, not official. BTF is unofficial. Yeah. Yeah. BTF is unofficial.
[02:40:52] Similar meanings, except for BTF, has, you know, greater capabilities, because it can be used for a
[02:40:57] lot more things than just, just, just, continue mission. So, you know, that's all good. It's all good.
[02:41:05] Eli. Yep. Any closing thoughts? Thank you, man. Thank you for, you know, what you're doing.
[02:41:12] And thank you for allowing a guy like me, you know, to come on this show. Like I've
[02:41:16] listened to this show for, you know, years. And I understand why you, you, you try and keep politics out of it,
[02:41:22] because, you know, I mean, it's such a divisive thing, but I just appreciate you taking a risk and
[02:41:27] bring it, allowing a guy like me to come on and, you know, talk about a little, even my faith, man.
[02:41:32] That's something that can be really divisive to people. And I definitely don't want it to be a
[02:41:37] divisive to people. And I definitely don't want it disrespect, which you've built, but I'm
[02:41:40] grateful that you allowed me to come on and talk about it, because at the end, bro, I do not want
[02:41:46] to be, I never wanted to be in Congress. I don't like Warren suits. I don't want to live in Washington,
[02:41:50] D.C. But I honestly believe if we don't get, if we don't get some men and women with courage
[02:41:57] and character that never wanted this job in the first place in key positions, I'm very concerned
[02:42:02] about what the future for my kids is going to look like. So thank you, man, for using what you've
[02:42:07] built to help guys like me. Yeah. Well, again, thank you. Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you
[02:42:15] for what you did. Thank you for job and the teams, man. That, that counts, bro, like getting after
[02:42:20] getting out there doing that job, holding the line in the teams. Thank you for doing that. And
[02:42:26] for what you did with what you did, what you continue to do with bottle breacher, like that's building
[02:42:31] the American economy. That's made in America. That's freaking outstanding. That's providing
[02:42:35] jobs for people. That's, that's awesome. And, and what you're doing right now going in a politics
[02:42:40] look, I don't like politics. I know you don't like politics. And, you know, I'm not like intentionally
[02:42:49] staring away from politics on this podcast. It's just not the thing that I talk about. No,
[02:42:55] man, and I've had other political people on here. I'll continue to have my, I've had people
[02:43:00] from both sides. I've had Democrats. I've had Republicans on here. People that have run for
[02:43:06] Democratic positions, people that have run for Republican positions, people, and, you know,
[02:43:12] talking about your faith, like, that's, that's a, I mean, I've, that's wide open. You know,
[02:43:17] you can't cover books about the military and not have faith in intertwined in those things
[02:43:24] from people that have, have been to the edge and back. But for me, you know, what I like,
[02:43:31] what I want and what I hope is that when people listen to what we talk about here, they actually
[02:43:36] listen to it. Actually, listen to what people are saying. Yeah. And instead of trying to figure out
[02:43:41] where I don't like you or where I don't agree with you, I try to figure out where I agree with you.
[02:43:47] Where do you have a common goal that that I have? And you want to see America moving the same
[02:43:54] direction that I want to see it? And maybe we have some different ideas about how to get there.
[02:43:58] Yeah. That's okay. That's okay. You know, in a platoon, you ask a pl, you ask every single guy in a
[02:44:06] platoon to come up with a plan for a mission. They're all going to come up with a different way.
[02:44:10] And they're all probably going to think their way is the best way. But guess what? We're all trying
[02:44:14] to do the same thing. And that's what we need to do in this country is look at where we're trying to
[02:44:20] go get on board, support each other, and let's move in that direction. Thanks for coming on, man.
[02:44:27] Thank you. Thank you. And Eli is on his way back to Arizona. And before he left,
[02:44:34] echo Charles, man. You normally aren't quite as hyped to get a picture with someone.
[02:44:42] As you were with Eli, because as far as you're concerned, Shark Tank is, he's a movie star
[02:44:52] for you. Well, or something. You know, you know, you know, but all when you watch them on it,
[02:44:56] you would just happen to watch that life. Like whenever it came out in 2014, you were watching.
[02:45:02] Yeah. So I've seen, I do watch Shark Tank. No, I've seen every single episode. Really? Yeah.
[02:45:07] Yes. How many seasons have there been? I don't know. One million. I don't know. Okay. But it's
[02:45:12] like that today. Like just like how Eli is like where I don't really watch TV, but there is one show
[02:45:17] that me and that's literally the one to show that you like. There's well, my fervo does not
[02:45:22] come on anymore. So yeah. Down to one show. Yeah. There's some other ones that are like cool.
[02:45:28] I'll catch it if it's like the tail end of the night and then whatever, but the one that we do
[02:45:33] watch together every episode Shark Tank. And that was one of them. No, I didn't know him.
[02:45:40] But he was like, you know, I'm a veteran, you know, former Navy SEAL and stuff. So I figure,
[02:45:44] okay, we must know, you know, kind of the same people and just in general. But the thing that
[02:45:50] really was like, I was down for the causes when he showed that thing, man, the freaking 50 caliber
[02:45:56] bottle opener. Come on. I mean, that, you know, was it the cure for cancer? No. But it was the coolest thing
[02:46:03] I've ever seen ever in terms of bottle opener. He'd be able to believe. Yeah. It was really cool. And
[02:46:10] when, you know, after a while, you can tell like, okay, the product alone is such a good idea that
[02:46:15] he, of course, he's going to get a deal. It was like that thought like, yeah, I thought, oh,
[02:46:19] he's going to get a deal. And he got a double. Yeah. He got a double deal. You shark's. That's a big deal.
[02:46:23] Actually, three sharks bid because one other shark said, I'll do a deal right now. And then he
[02:46:29] lies said, hey, just out of respect for the other sharks. I want to make sure that just does anyone
[02:46:37] else have anything to offer. And then the other shark stepped in and made an offer. And then the other
[02:46:44] shark. I don't know all the sharks. That's another little detail. And that's fun. That's
[02:46:51] interesting because I do remember him saying that. But I totally forgot that he was the one who said
[02:46:55] that, which, okay, so I was good was how he framed it. I remember that part. He framed it as not as like
[02:47:04] and actually they made fun of him a little bit because he said he said, he said out of respect for the
[02:47:11] other sharks. I want to make sure that none of you would like to make an offer as well. When
[02:47:15] what he was really saying was, hey, listen to say, if we also want to throw it in the market,
[02:47:19] then the one of the female sharks said, oh, out of respect for us, like she kind of called them on it.
[02:47:25] But he did it right. He did it right. And so good job, you lie. Usually how they say it is kind of like,
[02:47:31] well, it wouldn't be smart for me as a businessman to, you know, just like taking off for the
[02:47:36] first offer. So they they'll frame it something like that. Like, hey, out of out of like my own or
[02:47:41] our business interest money. When he said out of respect for the other that's undeniable right there.
[02:47:46] Because this is what the sharks will do sometimes. Cuban will do this. He'll be like, um,
[02:47:50] do they have their own little methodologies that they use? What's Cuban do? He'll go, if you really
[02:47:55] want to, he'll bully the other sharks. So he'll be like this. He'll go, hey, I'm offering you this
[02:47:59] this, but you got to take it right now. Like he started and I don't want to hear them. If you start
[02:48:04] taking there and he'll totally do it too. He'll be like, well, you know, I should think I should
[02:48:08] hear an offer from and if the one of the other sharks starts talking like, hey, I'll offer you this
[02:48:13] Cuban will be like, I'm out. So they miss it. And now he has kind of a little bit of a reputation
[02:48:18] for doing that kind of stuff sometimes. So now people get really, oh, and they jump at it, you know?
[02:48:22] But if you frame it like, hey, out of respect for the other sharks, you would have to paint
[02:48:27] himself as a bad guy now for him to really follow through. Yeah, it was good. I want to see
[02:48:32] him so respectable. Who you like? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's only a good. It was cool to have
[02:48:38] him on here, man. But definitely cool. And even though he's trying to get me to run for
[02:48:44] freaking governor of California and stuff, I'd have to do a campaign video. Oh, yeah, you can't
[02:48:51] paint a video guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you might even have to work. I really hope it doesn't
[02:48:59] come to that man, but but I give it up for these guys that are out there doing this because
[02:49:04] I look, I can, you know, sometimes people say, oh, I wouldn't like to do that, but you know, they're
[02:49:09] lying. Yeah, you know, they're like, I don't want to have to run for this position. Yeah,
[02:49:13] feeling of the need for them. My country's calling me and you know that they're not telling
[02:49:16] the truth. Yeah, like you can, you lies like, hey, I don't want to do this. You can definitely
[02:49:20] lie like literally does not want to do this. No choice, but at the same time, you can see the passion
[02:49:26] in he knows that we need help. And he's right, he's right, man. He's right, good on him. He came
[02:49:33] at me with the direct approach, which is normally not your recommended approach, but it kind of
[02:49:40] made me think, man, I'm weak over here. Well, yeah, and even if you don't, and this is all in a big
[02:49:47] picture kind of way, this is all just the natural course of things where like if things get too
[02:49:52] extreme and everyone sort of recognize the way this thing, this two extremes, it's going to start
[02:49:58] tipping the other way. Usually when it tips the other way, just like a swing, right? It's going to
[02:50:02] it's going to tip maybe a little bit more, you know, and hopefully it'll settle. Hopefully at some point.
[02:50:08] I am, I am keep waiting for California to start swimming back. And it is, you are starting to see
[02:50:15] indications, right? There was a female mayor up in San Francisco that she just came out and was like,
[02:50:21] alright, we're crushing crime, we're funding the police. And she was, this is in San Francisco.
[02:50:26] This is like a liberal mayor of San Francisco. She started swinging it back the other way.
[02:50:31] Yeah. So that's the, one of the early indications of what's going down. I mean, you see the
[02:50:36] politicians out here just, they did a man at right now. It's what they did today. I don't know,
[02:50:42] but like they got, they put another mask mandate on indoor mask mandate. I mean, meanwhile,
[02:50:48] other parts of the country are wide open for months. Yeah, even the Denver guy. Same deal. Yeah.
[02:50:55] And oh, oh, wide open. England is, England's just saying we're done. We're done with COVID.
[02:51:00] Yeah. Hey, more people are going to get it. We know that. I think Sweden or some,
[02:51:05] somewhere off the, there's places that are just going wide open. Yeah. And Florida's been wide open.
[02:51:09] And Texas, man, I wasn't Texas for a couple years ago. I made it as a couple. Maybe it's like a year
[02:51:14] and a half ago. I did a jujitsu seminar or like a meet and greet at jujitsu. There was 200 people
[02:51:23] there rolling jujitsu. Meanwhile, California was in lockdown, by the way. So that's okay. So
[02:51:30] people are making decisions. But here's that here's, you know, I just saw a picture of the
[02:51:36] newsom who he was just talking about at a football game with a bunch of other politicians,
[02:51:42] none of them wearing masks as they have mandated for everyone else. Yeah. You see,
[02:51:48] you can't get away with that forever. No. You can't, it just doesn't work. Yeah. And that's why
[02:51:54] the pendulum is going to start to swing back. That's what's going to happen. I hope I don't have
[02:51:58] to ride that pendulum to the other side. Yeah. Because I really don't want to. I want to surf.
[02:52:04] I want to do jujitsu. I want to make the podcast. I want to build the companies that were building.
[02:52:09] So and and if we can do that properly, maybe we don't have to get into this whole freaking political
[02:52:16] thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, if you're in a bus, we'll say, or fan. So we're in a bus.
[02:52:22] You know what? I feel like that's my political theory. That's your thing. And I don't know about it.
[02:52:29] But like, I think it's got to be, I'm talking chaos. I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking
[02:52:35] total mayhem and chaos. And I don't really think I would be in no, I don't, I think it's, I think
[02:52:40] I would become a political leader in an environment when things are no longer the way they were.
[02:52:49] You know what I'm saying? I think I'm, I think I'm more stepping up to a really hostile situation.
[02:52:57] Yeah. That's where I'd get. That's where I grow and hot. Yeah. And in a lot of terms,
[02:53:00] two, we have to remind ourselves that, or remind ourselves of the question of, is it really hostile?
[02:53:07] Or is it just hostile like on the internet? Yeah, you're on the TV or whatever. And I'm not
[02:53:12] to say it is or isn't. I'm just saying that's always a good reminder. And I would tell you that
[02:53:15] there are elements that are hostile in real life. There's definitely elements that are hostile.
[02:53:20] And now, the thing with Joe Rogan was just crazy right now. You know? And the point that he was
[02:53:26] making in this little nine minute episode that he did, I mean, people got banned from Twitter for saying
[02:53:35] masks don't work. Yeah. And by the way, there was people out there wearing three and four
[02:53:39] masks when I was traveling, let's go the airport, there'd be people with two masks on and a
[02:53:43] face shield, right? And okay, hey, cool, go, go do that. But some people were saying, hey,
[02:53:51] this does, how does this work? And you know, the people like dude, it's a piece of cloth over my face.
[02:53:55] How's that stopping anything? And that was just a kind of a common sense approach. Okay,
[02:53:59] we're banned from your band from talking. Even if you're like, it doesn't seem like there's
[02:54:03] does a lot. You're banned from talking. So now, now you talk about those election things. And it's like,
[02:54:09] hey, it doesn't, it seems like these states that were like swing states, there was
[02:54:14] devoting stop. And in the only four like swing states that matter, devoting stop counting at midnight,
[02:54:20] does that seem weird? Yeah. Oh, you're banned. You know what I'm going to say that.
[02:54:25] Yeah. What the right answer should be, hey, that's a good question. Let's do some analytics and
[02:54:30] figure out what happened. Yeah. So, and there's, I, I do know that there's some other
[02:54:35] information that's coming out right now that is definitely, let me rephrase that. There's the
[02:54:42] information coming out about the 2020 election that indicates that maybe things should be looked at
[02:54:48] a little bit more. So, uh, and again, if it's wrong, and it turns out that the election was
[02:54:57] squared away, then cool. You go, okay, cool. Now you all can stop worrying about it.
[02:55:01] All you freaking crazy right wing fringe Trump maniacs can calm down now because look,
[02:55:06] here's the facts. But instead of what they're saying is like, hey, shut up, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:55:13] What does it do? What do you do? When you suppress that information, what does it do to those people?
[02:55:17] It embold, it doesn't embolden them. It makes them even more suspicious. You know, and that's not a good
[02:55:23] move. When you won't show the NFL team, the video, they just go, see, they don't know, show
[02:55:29] it's a bad move. Are these things out? Man, what's the worst case scenario? What's the worst case
[02:55:36] scenario? Hey, we got, we got some, we got to fix our elections a little bit. That's, that seems
[02:55:41] legitimate to me. I want to have everybody's vote count. Okay, cool. Don't you? Or do you not?
[02:55:49] Because if you do not, then we have a serious problem with our alignment between us two as human beings.
[02:55:56] I'm American. I think we vote for our people, and that's who gets put in office.
[02:56:04] Don't you think that? You know, and if you don't think that, we have a serious problem.
[02:56:09] And I don't think most Americans, the vast, vast majority, are like, yeah, whoever gets voted,
[02:56:18] that's who should be in office. Cool. We agree on that. We can agree on that. Should the voting
[02:56:24] beast done in a method words kind of standardized and make sense and it's hard to cheat?
[02:56:31] Wouldn't that make sense? Yeah, that would make sense. Okay, cool. Yeah, that instant replay analogy was
[02:56:38] pretty much spot on there because it does like, you know, in football, as the example is,
[02:56:44] the if, you know, usually it's like a touchdown or an out-of-bound scenario, whatever, right?
[02:56:49] Where the line matters, critical moment. Yeah, actually, actually technically it's never,
[02:56:54] it doesn't have to be in a critical moment. Can be the first play they gave? The problem is that
[02:56:57] you only get so many of those calls. You can only go to the video tape a certain number of times,
[02:57:02] and you might not want to waste it if it's like, you know, if you've the first and two,
[02:57:06] yeah, if you ever. I think that's challenging the, yeah, yeah, challenging the rest call. That's,
[02:57:11] that's true. So either way, if the reason that exists is because we do, no matter what team you're
[02:57:22] trained for, Simon, it's just 49ers or the Denver Broncos, whoever, wherever you're trained for,
[02:57:29] you do want to know the truth. Yeah. Like no one wanted, like, if someone didn't make a touchdown,
[02:57:35] it's pretty hard for us to be like, yeah, we should just give them the touchdown, even though he
[02:57:39] didn't make the touchdown, like, that doesn't make much sense. Yeah, and it especially doesn't
[02:57:43] make sense. Even if you're like, well, you know, my team kind of wants, or I just want to let it slide.
[02:57:48] The problem with that attitude, which is understandable, you know, I'm a raging,
[02:57:52] freaking Denver Broncos friend, and it looked like a touch. I think it was a touch. We just need to
[02:57:57] let it slide this time. Here's the problem. You've just now said in place a precedent where we're
[02:58:03] not going to review things. That's what we're, okay. So now we're just going with whatever that
[02:58:07] ref saw that was a weird angle, and he called it a touchdown. So we're good. We're just going to go
[02:58:11] with that for now on. That's not the precedent you want to set. You want to set a precedent,
[02:58:14] like, okay, we have a way of assessing whether this was actually a touchdown or not. And that's what
[02:58:21] we're going to utilize. So you might say, you know what, I really want the Broncos to win,
[02:58:25] and it kind of looked like a touchdown, but the right thing to do for future reference, and for future
[02:58:31] precedents is to say, let's go to the video tape and confirm. But the politicians that said that,
[02:58:38] and a lot of it was tied to the fact that the January 6th event happened. And that made people just
[02:58:46] go, I don't want to, I don't want to catch any flag for what's going on. This is getting crazy. Let's just
[02:58:52] move forward and call it what it is. Looks like they won't go to the video tape. When the video tape,
[02:58:59] we'll make people say, yeah, you know what, the team won. Or, or they say, oh, the team didn't win,
[02:59:07] and now we got some serious issues that we need to attend to. It's very strange times, man.
[02:59:13] It's a very strange time. What's weird? Here's what's weird about this. Is me saying what I just said,
[02:59:19] it seems like pretty normal. It seems pretty logical. Well,
[02:59:23] shouldn't you go to the video tape? No one's going to listen to that and say, no,
[02:59:27] they're going to say, yeah, if that's the rule and you have the data, then why wouldn't you check it.
[02:59:34] But you transfer that exact analogy to the 2020 election and all of a sudden, whoever says,
[02:59:43] hey, maybe we should review the information and the data is a savage, you know,
[02:59:50] insurrectionist, whatever. Well, it's like, no, I'm not an insurrectionist at all. What I want to
[02:59:57] do is review the data. So if someone says that, they get even worse accusations. So it's very strange
[03:00:05] times. So do you, and you mentioned something just a second ago about how in the NFL,
[03:00:10] you only get a few chances to challenge the call. I think I'm not in the NFL. I admit, and it's been a while,
[03:00:16] really, since I've, you know, so that rule could be changed. I don't know. But nonetheless, that was a rule at
[03:00:22] some point. Yeah. And that's for a reason because if there's no limit to, let me challenge every single call
[03:00:28] and jam up this whole system, this whole game, this whole game is 12 hours long now, because I'm
[03:00:33] challenging every call that goes against me. Right? So isn't that part of the game too? Where?
[03:00:39] What's interesting about like the election was people were like, who we don't want to investigate
[03:00:43] everything. We just want to make sure that these key areas that had voting anomalies that are
[03:00:49] documented, maybe we should check those out. Shut up. There. No. Right. So it's almost like a tactic
[03:00:55] where you could, if you're on the other side, right? You could be like, hey, you're just trying
[03:01:00] to stop. You're just what you call. You can't let it go. What were they saying? They were saying,
[03:01:04] like, you can't just accept the truth. It's like that. You know, you want to keep that as an unlimited
[03:01:10] uh, you know, challenging the call. Yeah. You know what? Well, what makes this really scary?
[03:01:14] Well, makes it all that really scary. It's because I haven't dove enough into the details,
[03:01:19] but what makes it really scary is that what just what Joe Rogan just talked about, which is, hey,
[03:01:25] people were getting banned from social media for saying masks didn't work and now it's the reality.
[03:01:30] People were getting banned from social media for saying the vaccine you could still spread COVID
[03:01:35] even if you had a vaccine. And that is actually true. And by the way, people were getting banned
[03:01:41] for saying you could still catch COVID. Guess what? That's true. So all these things,
[03:01:46] we didn't have an open conversation about them because one side got completely shut down,
[03:01:49] which is crazy. So there you go. Can't have an open conversation. That's disturbing
[03:01:57] when you can't have an open conversation. And when what you have to watch out for is people that
[03:02:04] whatever methodology they want to use raised their voice and yell over you. So whether that
[03:02:12] mean, I'm not talking, so could that be, if you and I are in a discussion and you start going,
[03:02:18] I don't care about that. And you start raising your voice and yelling and talking over me?
[03:02:22] Okay, but that's just you and me. I realize you're just mad, whatever, but I didn't get my point
[03:02:27] across, but you don't care because you leave. That, that behavior in social media, that behavior
[03:02:39] in the news, that behavior in mainstream media where, oh, echo saying something I don't like.
[03:02:45] So I'm going to attack him, raise my voice, but through whatever means that might mean,
[03:02:51] you know, retweeting you with hate, calling you this or calling you that or doing a personal
[03:02:54] attack, all that behavior. Now we're not discussing the topic. We're discussing that I hate you.
[03:03:04] You have watched the movie the time machine, you ever heard of it, I didn't watch it, but
[03:03:10] okay, so the time machine is okay, Guy Pierce, who's also the star of Memento, by the way.
[03:03:18] You know, a guy Pierce boom, he makes time machine, he goes away in the future and, you know,
[03:03:21] he finds that humans have split evolutionarily speaking. So they were actually split in three,
[03:03:29] but so one, so he goes with the villagers or whatever and like he says something,
[03:03:34] wait a second, this could have been stargate. Nonetheless, he says something and everything
[03:03:40] a time machine back to before this story. Everyone like turns their back or starts walking away
[03:03:47] or erases what he wrote in his time or something like that. And someone who like somebody explains
[03:03:52] to him, hey, like you can't speak of that, you just can't speak of it. And I think later on they find out,
[03:03:57] like, you know, we're behind and something like that. And that's the thing, what's something you guys
[03:04:01] got to listen to what they say and it isn't ironic that Neil Young's song, keep on rocking in the
[03:04:05] free world. He's like, don't talk anymore. Right, like that's crazy, right? Boy, that's crazy.
[03:04:12] Yep, that's why we have the underdrumped. By the way, we have the underdrumped.
[03:04:16] I'm going around dot com. Why do we have that? Why do we charge $8 and $18 a month
[03:04:22] to have our own little platform that this is why? Because what we're talking about right now,
[03:04:29] this may get rolled, this may get bounced, this may get edited, right? And we're not actually
[03:04:35] making a statement one way or the other. I'm just explaining things that have happened. Yeah.
[03:04:40] I haven't dug through the details enough. I don't spend my time digging through the details of
[03:04:46] current events. I don't do that. That's not, but you know why? Because I'm not that interested
[03:04:52] and because other people that commit their time to them, let these other people go do that.
[03:04:57] I'm going to be reading about World War II, Vietnam, Korea, the Peloponnesian Wars. That's what
[03:05:02] I'm doing over on my side. I'm going to be trying to jitter, hopefully going surfing, playing guitar,
[03:05:06] those are the things that I'm doing. I'm not parsing through the news stories that came out
[03:05:12] in the last 48 hours to try and get you and catch you on something. But when you let a little
[03:05:19] time go by and we talked about this on one of the underground points. So I let time go by and the
[03:05:24] truth starts to rise to the surface. Now it took six to eight months for the truth to rise to
[03:05:29] the surface on some of these stories. But again, you know what's sleep I lost over these stories
[03:05:33] while they were happening? Not very much. I wasn't freaking, I was like, these masks don't work or
[03:05:38] I wasn't like, you better put on a mask. I didn't lose sleep over that. Because I was like, hey,
[03:05:41] it doesn't seem like going to work that good to me. Oh, you know, I'm going to carry on with my life.
[03:05:46] That's what I'm doing. So we don't know when we might get suppressed. So that's why we made
[03:05:54] Joccon around dot com. If you want to, you can help us out. If anything happens to any of these platforms
[03:06:00] that you listen to this on, we will still have that platform. We do an extra podcast on it about
[03:06:06] once a week. And we talk about other things that maybe don't fit quite on Jockel podcast, but we
[03:06:11] want to get them out there too. So you can check that out. If you can't afford it, look, if you can't
[03:06:14] afford it, it's okay. We still got you. You can email, what is it? Assistance at jockel underground.com.
[03:06:22] We appreciate your support on that. You know, also we were talking about American-made companies.
[03:06:27] You know, that's kind of, that's, that's what, that's the way I am trying to help America right now
[03:06:34] by building these companies with the origin team, origin us a dot com. If you need to get boots,
[03:06:38] if you need to get jeans, if you need to get a G, which you probably do,
[03:06:43] then get go to origin us a dot com and by the way, you probably, you may have seen we have a hunting
[03:06:48] line coming out. So we, we're going to be making clothes for hunting. That's what we're doing.
[03:06:54] We've got all kinds of good clothes coming out as well. Work out clothes, by the way,
[03:06:58] echo Charles. So we're going to cover you down on that as well. Origin us a dot com. We also have
[03:07:05] jockel fuel dot com. I'm barely, barely on my game today. Why? I didn't sleep last night. Probably
[03:07:14] got two hours, maybe two and a half. And I've, this is my second jocco discipline go, which is it,
[03:07:21] which is a drink. It's a drink. Could you call it an energy drink? You could because it does have
[03:07:26] energy in it, but when you hear energy drink, you're thinking, oh, oh, you're going to ingest some
[03:07:31] poison that's going to get you a jittery and hyper for about an hour and a half. And then you're
[03:07:35] going to crash and be sick and be diabetic. We're not in that category. No sugar in here,
[03:07:40] sweetened with monk fruit, 95 milligrams of caffeine. Get you on that nice little. You're good to go.
[03:07:47] You're good to go. People say people, if you don't sleep, you don't, it's like, no,
[03:07:52] less than eight hours of sleep is like being a point zero eight. Do you why? You're, you're mentally
[03:07:58] impaired. Look, I'm not saying it's good for you, but it's not as bad as, you know, look, should you,
[03:08:03] get sleep, no, I'm going to get me wrong. Get sleep. Sleep as much as you can. Sleep as much as you want.
[03:08:12] Okay, don't get crazy, but what I'm saying is, if you see a little bit less and you need a little
[03:08:18] swamp hitter, get yourself some jocco fuel, jocco fuel.com. Yeah, that's good. I will also
[03:08:23] contend that even if you got a lot of sleep. Drink because it is good for you. Yeah, it's
[03:08:28] healthy for you. Look, hey, look, some people hate some people drink coffee, right? In the morning,
[03:08:33] good drink coffee, back coffee, whatever you, however you drink coffee. If you get eight hours of
[03:08:38] sleep, what should you not drink coffee? Not necessarily because of kind of good, drink some coffee,
[03:08:43] man. You like that one? You want that as you would say hit or whatever, the reason same deal.
[03:08:48] Mm-hmm. And it's healthy for you. Yep. So boom, you'll be better off either way. Also new tropics in there.
[03:08:54] Yep. It's not ignore that. That's good for your brain. That is nutrients. Yep.
[03:08:59] For your brain. That's probably why you don't need to overload the caffeine with the go.
[03:09:03] Yeah. You don't need to because it's got the new tropics in there. Get your up there on step,
[03:09:07] rock and then on. Right, there was a commercial and I remember the drink I forget what it was called,
[03:09:12] because I used to get it. It's juice. Straight up juice. Like juice juice. Oh, like apple juice.
[03:09:18] Yeah. Like it was like a mix I think. I forget what it was. But nonetheless,
[03:09:21] their thing was like feed your brain. Well, now as an adult, I'm looking at like,
[03:09:26] like feed your brain. Isn't there like 50 grams of sugar in that thing right there?
