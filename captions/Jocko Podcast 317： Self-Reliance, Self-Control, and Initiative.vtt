00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.32
This is Jockel podcast number three, 17 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:06.32 --> 00:00:13.84
Good evening. All right. The Marine Corps, specifically the Marine Corps, Institute has,

3
00:00:15.04 --> 00:00:20.08
well they seem to do this on a regular basis, they put out manuals with,

4
00:00:20.08 --> 00:00:28.72
with some incredible insight about leadership, about human nature, about combat.

5
00:00:30.64 --> 00:00:38.40
It is not just about combat. It's not just about combat at all. The things that they put out

6
00:00:39.76 --> 00:00:45.04
applied directly to business and to life in general, and I'm going to read some excerpts today

7
00:00:45.04 --> 00:00:50.72
from a manual that was actually designed for remote learning, and I think these days when we think

8
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:58.80
a remote learning, we think of Zoom calls. This is old school remote learning where you get a book,

9
00:00:58.80 --> 00:01:04.96
read a book, read a section, learn about something, take tests inside the sections. It's a,

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.48
it's one of those. It's a remote learning old school remote learning where you'd get a book, a manual,

11
00:01:10.48 --> 00:01:17.20
filling answers, read sections, this particular class is called infantry squad leader,

12
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:24.72
combat leadership. And I'm just going to review some of the texts. If you go online,

13
00:01:24.72 --> 00:01:29.04
there's, you can go online and get this manual, and there's questions, and there's quizzes, and

14
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:39.28
there's, it's a full-on course, but the text that's in it, it's a very well written text,

15
00:01:39.28 --> 00:01:47.04
and addresses things that apply to everything that everyone does all the time, every day,

16
00:01:47.04 --> 00:01:54.40
stuff, stuff we all have to contend with. So here we go. infantry squad leader

17
00:01:56.40 --> 00:02:04.08
from the Marine Corps Institute, combat leadership. It starts off with a little cover letter

18
00:02:04.08 --> 00:02:12.24
from the director of the Marine Corps Institute. This, this subject course provides instruction

19
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:16.96
for all marine NGOs on the conditions of combat, and how they can begin to prepare their

20
00:02:16.96 --> 00:02:22.56
Marines for combat. Now, if you aren't a Marine and you're a business leader or you're a

21
00:02:22.56 --> 00:02:29.36
football coach or you're a parent in a family, I think you're going to see this applies to you too,

22
00:02:29.36 --> 00:02:37.36
100% and it'll do you and I can throw around 100% from time to time, just sort of

23
00:02:38.56 --> 00:02:45.60
a little bit much, 100%. But I'm telling you this one right here, 100%. So starts off, and this is

24
00:02:45.60 --> 00:02:49.92
the way they, but this is what I like about the Marine Corps thinks through some stuff. Here's

25
00:02:49.92 --> 00:02:56.48
something they've fought through. It starts off with us. Congratulations on your enrollment in a distance

26
00:02:56.48 --> 00:03:01.44
education course from the distance learning and technologies department of the Marine Corps Institute.

27
00:03:01.44 --> 00:03:06.72
Since 1920, the Marine Corps Institute has been helping tens of thousands of hard charging

28
00:03:06.72 --> 00:03:13.44
Marines like you improve their technical job performance skills through distance learning. By

29
00:03:13.44 --> 00:03:18.88
enrolling in this course, you have shown a desire to improve the skills you have and master new

30
00:03:18.88 --> 00:03:26.32
skills to enhance your job performance. They're building you up just as you read

31
00:03:26.32 --> 00:03:31.12
this. You're getting in the game. Here's your personal character. Actually, it's going to tell you

32
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:37.60
what your personal characteristics are. You are properly motivated. You have made a positive decision

33
00:03:37.60 --> 00:03:42.48
to get training on your own. Self motivation is perhaps the most important force in learning or

34
00:03:42.48 --> 00:03:50.000
achieving anything. Doing whatever is necessary to learn is motivation. You have it. That's a good tactic

35
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.80
by the way. You seek to improve yourself. Now again, does this apply to just Marines and combat?

36
00:03:56.80 --> 00:04:03.60
How many human beings are looking to improve themselves? Everyone. You seek to improve yourself.

37
00:04:03.60 --> 00:04:08.96
You unroll to improve those skills. You already possess and learn new skills when you improve

38
00:04:08.96 --> 00:04:16.56
yourself. You improve the core. You have the initiative to act by acting on your own. You have

39
00:04:16.56 --> 00:04:20.64
shown you are a self-starter willing to reach out for opportunities to learn and grow.

40
00:04:20.64 --> 00:04:24.72
These are the most positive attributes they can put on a human being and they're just throwing them.

41
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.12
How about this one? You accept challenges. You have self confidence and belief in your ability

42
00:04:31.12 --> 00:04:34.64
to acquire knowledge and skills. You have the self confidence to set goals in the ability to

43
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:42.16
achieve them and enabling you to meet every challenge. You are able to set and accomplish

44
00:04:42.16 --> 00:04:47.04
practical goals. You are willing to commit time, effort and resources necessary to set and accomplish

45
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:53.12
your goals. These professional traits will help you successfully complete this distance learning course.

46
00:04:53.12 --> 00:04:58.32
I was actually thinking we were going to go into like all another realm of living. But it is going

47
00:04:58.32 --> 00:05:03.52
to help us with this distance learning course as well. Start off a little section called

48
00:05:03.52 --> 00:05:09.84
characteristics of combat. Every Marine is a warrior, a potential combat leader. You may be in combat

49
00:05:09.84 --> 00:05:15.04
tomorrow. Regardless of how well your unit is trained, you must harden yourself for your first action.

50
00:05:15.04 --> 00:05:18.80
You do not need to experience combat in order to understand the essential requirements for leading

51
00:05:18.80 --> 00:05:23.60
your Marines in combat. However, it is fundamental, it is your fundamental responsibility to

52
00:05:23.60 --> 00:05:27.36
physically and mentally prepare yourself and your Marines for battle.

53
00:05:29.52 --> 00:05:35.52
Now, are we just talking about Marines? What about life? What about life? You may be in a hard

54
00:05:35.52 --> 00:05:43.04
situation tomorrow. That's what's going on. So you got to prepare for that. So this starts off with

55
00:05:43.04 --> 00:05:50.88
an excerpt. This is probably the longest excerpt that I'm going to read. It's from a book called

56
00:05:50.88 --> 00:05:55.60
the Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sare. It's a book that we actually haven't covered on this podcast.

57
00:05:55.60 --> 00:06:02.96
I'm going to a little bit of why that is. But here we go. We had just witnessed two or three major

58
00:06:02.96 --> 00:06:09.44
assaults. From the screams of anguish to our left, we concluded that a great many of our men had

59
00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:15.44
been killed. We had emptied five magazines and were warming our fingers on the hot metal of the

60
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:21.60
machine gun. Our six and last magazine had been attached and we were anxiously waiting for fresh

61
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:28.96
supplies. The night was continuously lit by the explosions of thousands of Russian shells, which made

62
00:06:28.96 --> 00:06:34.56
movement extremely difficult. Our trenches, which in any case were not deep enough, extended

63
00:06:34.56 --> 00:06:40.48
only to certain positions. The others had to be reached by leaps and bounds, alternating with

64
00:06:40.48 --> 00:06:46.80
plunges to the ground and writhing on our stomachs across dozens of yards of snow mixed with chunks

65
00:06:46.80 --> 00:06:53.92
of frozen earth. From time to time, we could see four figures moving toward us jumping from

66
00:06:53.92 --> 00:06:59.28
crater to crater carrying shells for our 50 millimeter mortar and magazines for the spand out.

67
00:07:00.48 --> 00:07:06.16
They were still about 40 yards away when their shadowing mass was surrounded by a flash of white light.

68
00:07:08.32 --> 00:07:14.96
We never heard any cries. A few minutes later, I was sent out to crawl to the point of impact.

69
00:07:14.96 --> 00:07:19.76
The sergeant ordered me to bring back at least two magazines. I had just arrived at my

70
00:07:19.76 --> 00:07:25.60
destination when I heard the Russian assault cry, followed by shower of grenades and mortar shells.

71
00:07:26.64 --> 00:07:33.52
The ground shook beneath me in a manner which defied all predictions. I felt like a pea inside a

72
00:07:33.52 --> 00:07:39.60
fierce, ferociously beaten drum. I was lying flat on the ground among the bodies of comrades

73
00:07:39.60 --> 00:07:44.80
killed only a few minutes before unable to see any of the supplies I'd been sent to fetch.

74
00:07:44.80 --> 00:07:52.96
Then I heard the sound of a tank. The darkness all around me was broken by streaks of light

75
00:07:52.96 --> 00:08:00.80
and large pink and yellow explosions. In a momentary beam from some headlight, I could see a small

76
00:08:00.80 --> 00:08:09.28
sign marked S157. I opened my mouth wide as prescribed because I could hardly breathe and

77
00:08:09.28 --> 00:08:15.04
lay where I was frantically groping for something to hang onto in the diabolical setting where

78
00:08:15.04 --> 00:08:20.24
horizontal and vertical alternated to the rhythm of the lights which slashed the darkness.

79
00:08:21.92 --> 00:08:27.36
I thought that I could recognize the uproar. The crackle of the weapon I had

80
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:35.20
operated with whiner before, I had only left a moment ago and felt that my sanity might be close to

81
00:08:35.20 --> 00:08:43.04
collapse. I could see no escape from my situation and lay glued to the ground with my head down

82
00:08:43.04 --> 00:08:53.36
like a trust animal waiting for the butcher's axe. So it goes on a little bit further with this

83
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:59.44
section which is out of that book that forgotten soldier. We haven't covered that book on the

84
00:08:59.44 --> 00:09:07.92
podcast, the forgotten soldier. We probably will at some point. There's some disputes about the

85
00:09:07.92 --> 00:09:16.72
veracity of the book and the author, I think I just read a little bit more about this last night.

86
00:09:18.16 --> 00:09:25.20
The author, Guy Sarah, he, there's some important details that he misses that he just gets wrong.

87
00:09:25.20 --> 00:09:33.44
One of them is there's some patch that they had in this unit and it was this highly regarded patch

88
00:09:33.44 --> 00:09:38.24
and he talks about how they sewed it onto their right sleeve or left sleeve or something like that.

89
00:09:38.24 --> 00:09:47.12
And people that were in that unit said no way would any buddy that was in that unit ever make a mistake

90
00:09:47.12 --> 00:09:53.36
about where to sew that patch on. That's one of the types of things or there's certain weapons

91
00:09:53.36 --> 00:10:00.72
that he talks about that weren't there. He talks about an aircraft that didn't exist at this time.

92
00:10:00.72 --> 00:10:05.36
So there's some things in there that there's some details that were wrong and some of the veterans

93
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:11.04
that fought in the same battles. This him have called Mount Sinan. This guy is not telling the

94
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:16.72
truth about some stuff. And then there's other veterans that talk about the battles or that he

95
00:10:16.72 --> 00:10:22.88
writes about and say hey the only way he would know this stuff is if he was there. So and here's the

96
00:10:22.88 --> 00:10:27.76
thing memory is not accurate and people's memories aren't accurate and certainly people's memory

97
00:10:27.76 --> 00:10:33.44
about intense combat operations is inaccurate and he eventually made a statement about

98
00:10:34.24 --> 00:10:39.36
that and kind of said that said hey if you want to know the historical details go ask a general

99
00:10:39.36 --> 00:10:45.12
that was in an action about to go off a little bit. He doesn't say that. Go he says go ask a military

100
00:10:45.12 --> 00:10:48.80
historian go ask a general because that's what they do. I didn't want to do that. I'm my

101
00:10:48.80 --> 00:10:58.40
books about the emotions of a combat soldier. But the reason they put this in here is to get a good

102
00:10:58.40 --> 00:11:05.36
account of the chaos and mayhem and fear inside a combat and then you roll right into this section here

103
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:10.32
which is called fear of combat. It starts off with this we have all experienced fear. In combat

104
00:11:10.32 --> 00:11:16.72
fear can dominate the situation unless you and your Marines can control it. Extreme fear brings out

105
00:11:16.72 --> 00:11:23.52
your instinct for self preservation. Survival drive survival is a very strong drive which generally

106
00:11:23.52 --> 00:11:31.04
will be a priority concern to any Marine. As I was reading this and again I'm reading these

107
00:11:31.04 --> 00:11:39.68
things in the context of life and fear is something that people contend with every single day

108
00:11:39.68 --> 00:11:44.96
and it's all in all kinds of different levels but whether it's fear of presenting in front of

109
00:11:44.96 --> 00:11:52.24
a client whether it's fear of asking for a raise whether it's fear of confronting some situation

110
00:11:53.52 --> 00:11:58.32
whether it's fear of going to a Gigiitsu class for the first time like there's all kinds of

111
00:11:59.28 --> 00:12:06.40
fears that people face on a daily basis. And here's some good information that yes it'll help you

112
00:12:06.40 --> 00:12:11.12
if you're combat Marine but it'll also help you if you're a human. Specific sources of fear.

113
00:12:11.12 --> 00:12:15.92
peacetime training may not prepare your Marines for the reality that combat is often a matter of

114
00:12:15.92 --> 00:12:21.60
killer be killed. Some of the specific sources of fear in combat are possibility of being killed

115
00:12:21.60 --> 00:12:27.68
wounded or captured fear of killing. Noise and sights of combat apprehensive that you might not

116
00:12:27.68 --> 00:12:36.40
measure up as a Marine under fire and the last one is fatigue. So possibility of being killed

117
00:12:36.40 --> 00:12:41.44
wounded or captured this is a natural source of fear and always we will be present in your Marines.

118
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.72
It may lead your Marines to run away from battle or do irrational things in battle. There is no

119
00:12:46.72 --> 00:12:52.64
sure way to know which Marine may be subject to such an extreme reaction to fear to this fear

120
00:12:52.64 --> 00:13:01.20
until you get in a combat. Fear of killing this is not uncommon. Our society is a peaceful one by

121
00:13:01.20 --> 00:13:08.24
nature. We are raised to respect the rights of all human beings and have to and to have respect for life.

122
00:13:09.04 --> 00:13:13.52
To forget these facts is to ignore the reality of our culture.

123
00:13:15.68 --> 00:13:21.36
Another one is the noise and sights of combat. These elements have a traumatic shocking impact

124
00:13:21.36 --> 00:13:27.52
on the senses. This causes confusion and a sense of chaos that can be come particularly unnerving.

125
00:13:27.52 --> 00:13:32.96
No peace, I'm training can completely prepare you and your Marines for the carnage and emotional

126
00:13:32.96 --> 00:13:38.56
impact of combat. To ignore this aspect of combat is to create a lack of understanding

127
00:13:39.52 --> 00:13:45.20
that could prove totally debilitating to your Marines. One thing I like about this is it's no

128
00:13:45.20 --> 00:13:52.32
no punches are pulled. Hey guess what? The carnage and emotional impact of combat

129
00:13:52.32 --> 00:13:58.000
are you're not going to be able to train for that 100%. You can't completely train for that.

130
00:13:59.20 --> 00:14:00.80
It doesn't sugarcoat.

131
00:14:02.88 --> 00:14:07.36
And then the last one is the apprehension that you might not measure up as a Marine

132
00:14:07.36 --> 00:14:12.16
under fire or let your buddies down may be common among your Marines. All of your Marines

133
00:14:12.16 --> 00:14:17.84
want to be successful. Their fears may play on this desire and they may be definitely afraid of

134
00:14:17.84 --> 00:14:23.44
letting you or their fellow Marines down. This particular fear may serve as a positive factor

135
00:14:23.44 --> 00:14:29.20
by keeping your unit cohesive during battle. It could be detrimental if the fear overcomes

136
00:14:29.20 --> 00:14:35.44
the desire to succeed. And they've got a quote in here from SLA Marshall, Metagins Fire.

137
00:14:35.44 --> 00:14:42.16
When fires sweeps the field, nothing keeps a man from running. Except a sense of honor.

138
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:49.20
The bound obligation to the people right around him of fear of failure in their site, which might

139
00:14:49.20 --> 00:14:55.28
eternally disgrace him. So it's interesting to think about, so this is like it says a positive

140
00:14:55.28 --> 00:15:01.84
factor. So how does it become a negative factor? It becomes a negative factor when your fear of

141
00:15:01.84 --> 00:15:08.72
letting people down doesn't allow you to actually go and do something. So if you, obviously on

142
00:15:08.72 --> 00:15:12.08
the battlefield, that could be a thing. I don't want to take charge of that. I don't want to

143
00:15:12.08 --> 00:15:16.000
step up because I don't want to make a bad decision. I don't want to let my friends down. And it

144
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.76
can happen in everyday life. This does happen in everyday life. People don't want to look stupid.

145
00:15:21.76 --> 00:15:29.60
People don't want to have people say, oh, you know, Jockel failed. Jockel is a loser. So instead,

146
00:15:29.60 --> 00:15:36.80
I just don't try anything. So we have to be careful with that. This is, I think, a good thing to think

147
00:15:36.80 --> 00:15:45.12
about is even though people, let's say you try something echo Charles and you fail,

148
00:15:46.48 --> 00:15:52.24
I might even verbally owe echo. See, he's a loser. But you know what? I think subconsciously,

149
00:15:52.24 --> 00:15:58.72
and in some cases, consciously, everybody knows everybody respects that you got, you know,

150
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:05.60
you got up. You took a swing, right? Took a swing at bat. And especially if they're cowards

151
00:16:05.60 --> 00:16:13.04
themselves and it's really easy to sit in the audience and watch and poke fun. Right?

152
00:16:13.84 --> 00:16:18.48
Don't be that person. That's it. It's the audience and poke fun. Get up to bat.

153
00:16:20.80 --> 00:16:25.84
Don't be afraid of looking bad. I guess my point is, don't be afraid of looking bad because

154
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:30.88
you don't actually look bad. When you make an attempt, when you step up, people respect it.

155
00:16:30.88 --> 00:16:35.36
Even if they try and bring you down, they're they're lying. They're just trying to bring you down

156
00:16:35.36 --> 00:16:39.76
because they know that you stepped up and they didn't. Don't be afraid of that.

157
00:16:43.28 --> 00:16:49.68
And the last source of fear is fatigue. Both mental and physical fatigue is a source of

158
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:55.12
fear. As you become exhausted, your ability to reason maybe get into deteriorate. As you become

159
00:16:55.12 --> 00:17:01.20
more and more tired, you may become indecisive and slow and carrying out your orders. When

160
00:17:01.20 --> 00:17:05.84
you confront the daily and costly with the stress of combat coupled with fatigue, you and your

161
00:17:05.84 --> 00:17:11.92
Marines may feel helpless and unable to continue the fight. And they've got a quote in here

162
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:18.24
from major general heart from a book called Determination in Bathletes says,

163
00:17:18.24 --> 00:17:23.36
there's no doubt that troops, however well-led, can only take the stress of battle for so long.

164
00:17:23.36 --> 00:17:29.68
Then they break. Ask any commander at any level who tries to overdraw the account.

165
00:17:30.56 --> 00:17:35.68
It's according disaster. The mental and the physical constantly interact.

166
00:17:36.48 --> 00:17:42.40
Therefore, physical fatigue, hunger, disease, thirst and above all, the stress of adverse

167
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:49.52
climactic climatic conditions can reduce the physical state of the soldier to such an extent

168
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:56.24
that is will to fight will be broken. Fatigue makes cowards of us all echo Charles.

169
00:17:57.84 --> 00:18:02.48
Do you agree with that? Do you feel like I'm personally attacking you right now?

170
00:18:02.48 --> 00:18:11.12
Yeah, if you want to. Yeah, that is a disturbing thing. But this is something that

171
00:18:11.68 --> 00:18:16.48
you don't fall prey to it quite as much, but man in the early days of Jiu Jitsu. And by

172
00:18:16.48 --> 00:18:23.36
early days, when you were like a purple belt, you didn't like it and tired at all. You used to really

173
00:18:23.36 --> 00:18:28.80
bother you. I still don't like getting tired. But I think, you know, when you can kind of

174
00:18:28.80 --> 00:18:34.96
reconcile the whole big picture where, you know, this kind of, it's obvious now, or like, okay,

175
00:18:34.96 --> 00:18:41.76
the best way to fight your fears to get used to that thing, that you don't like or whatever. So,

176
00:18:41.76 --> 00:18:46.16
yeah, so yeah, you conditioned, but here's this is how I know that I still don't like it.

177
00:18:47.84 --> 00:18:51.36
We're like, if I didn't, if I haven't done any conditioning for a while, and I'm like,

178
00:18:51.36 --> 00:18:56.000
I gotta get back into conditioning that first day, I'm like, oh my god, this is, I can feel it.

179
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.60
It's like, is it, is I wouldn't call it a fear of the conditioning, but you ever had a

180
00:19:01.60 --> 00:19:05.12
work, yeah, like, you know, okay, you know how you stuck on the 20 reps squats, right? You know,

181
00:19:05.12 --> 00:19:09.84
when you got the 20 reps squats coming and you know that pain is coming, you know, you

182
00:19:09.84 --> 00:19:12.56
can't get the butterflies a little bit before that, I mean, I don't know if you do.

183
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.68
I don't get the butterflies, I get like the, I get rationalization. You know, so I'll be thinking,

184
00:19:21.68 --> 00:19:26.88
you know what, I don't, this is, this is really kind of the work out that's really good for you.

185
00:19:26.88 --> 00:19:30.56
You know what I mean, I like start having all these conversations with myself. Yeah, and it's just

186
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:36.16
lies. Yeah, that's part of it too, but mine was for real, like, I'll be nervous of the conditioning,

187
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:40.48
like I don't, because and maybe this has a lot to do with like the kind of workouts that I've always

188
00:19:40.48 --> 00:19:45.84
like done or whatever, where you kind of have a standard where you, you know, okay, so if I have four

189
00:19:45.84 --> 00:19:52.08
exercises that I'm going to do as part of conditioning circuit, I four exercises, and I do one,

190
00:19:52.08 --> 00:19:57.52
the other, do the other, and I have a time to rest in between, like, you know, 20 seconds or 30

191
00:19:57.52 --> 00:20:03.04
seconds or do them all with no rest and then rest 30 seconds or whatever. To me, if I don't,

192
00:20:03.04 --> 00:20:08.32
if I have to rest more than the 30 seconds, like, I can't go, you know, like, I can't, like,

193
00:20:08.32 --> 00:20:12.96
you know, 30 seconds comes and I can't go because I got to rest more, I failed to work up.

194
00:20:12.96 --> 00:20:18.32
It's like going for a PR and failing it, right? How do you measure the 30 seconds? I have a clock going.

195
00:20:20.08 --> 00:20:25.04
What do you press start when you get to the end of whatever you're doing? No, so you just have the

196
00:20:25.04 --> 00:20:30.56
stopwatch going, so you start it and then you do it and you keep the stopwatch at that first circuit.

197
00:20:30.56 --> 00:20:35.52
So when you're done and you're back to the first circuit or you're, you're, you're finished the last circuit,

198
00:20:35.52 --> 00:20:41.20
you see and you do the math in your hands. You just run the math. Do you ever do work out to where

199
00:20:41.20 --> 00:20:45.28
you're not thinking straight? Like, it's for the running math because sometimes when I'm, I'm not running

200
00:20:45.28 --> 00:20:51.04
math. Yeah, it's an added thing. There's just some things going on. Yeah, 30 seconds is easy, though.

201
00:20:51.04 --> 00:20:55.04
Yeah. To run the math, but oh, yeah, it's an additional mental thing. That kind of, it's like,

202
00:20:55.04 --> 00:21:00.80
a mental conditioning for every two minutes. Yeah, but I'll be nervous though before it. Like, if I

203
00:21:00.80 --> 00:21:05.28
don't, if I haven't been doing it for a while, I'll be like kind of nervous like, what if I can't do it?

204
00:21:05.28 --> 00:21:10.000
You know, it's my workout. Well, now what am I scared of you? But I was saying I'll have that thought.

205
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.36
It's weird. All right. Well, that's an effective fear, which is the next section here.

206
00:21:15.36 --> 00:21:22.80
A effects on the squad. Fear is infectious. It can destroy the effectiveness of your squad,

207
00:21:22.80 --> 00:21:28.64
recognize fear and deal with it promptly. Poison important as a leader.

208
00:21:29.44 --> 00:21:34.32
Automatic body reactions physically, your body reacts when threatened or when you anticipate

209
00:21:34.32 --> 00:21:41.28
danger listed below are automatic body reactions to fear trembling, heart pounding, irrational

210
00:21:41.28 --> 00:21:48.32
laughter, sweating, tunnel vision, auditory exclusion, fight or flight response.

211
00:21:48.32 --> 00:21:57.44
Have you ever been trembling and fear before? Not that I can. What about, so when you're

212
00:21:57.44 --> 00:22:03.12
getting ready for these workouts that you're scared of? I'm not trembling. Have you ever,

213
00:22:04.40 --> 00:22:08.24
I remember sometimes when we were getting ready to do an off, like I look at some people in the room

214
00:22:08.72 --> 00:22:15.92
and sometimes they, not trend. I'm trembling, no, but like shaking, like taping their foot real

215
00:22:15.92 --> 00:22:22.56
hard and just that kind of stuff moving around a lot. Super nervous. Well, that makes sense.

216
00:22:22.56 --> 00:22:28.000
100%. Yeah, you're going to go in on a military operation. Yes, they're interesting.

217
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.28
But no, I haven't been on a military operation. I guess in football games before

218
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:36.56
football games, I'd y'all in all the time for them. That's one of those things. It's like

219
00:22:36.56 --> 00:22:44.56
involuntary. Yeah, where it's weird, but what about your stomach? Yes, you know, like I'll

220
00:22:44.56 --> 00:22:48.32
feel a little bit sick. Yeah, so it would be, and it wouldn't be my stomach. I'd have a weird

221
00:22:48.32 --> 00:22:53.68
gag reflex and remember, remember Scott Catlin. Oh yeah, yeah. So he would like everyone's

222
00:22:53.68 --> 00:22:57.36
while he'd be at the tournament with me or whatever and he'd be in training with me and stuff a

223
00:22:57.36 --> 00:23:04.32
lot. So in the tournaments, like before my first match, only I'd have a weird gag, like almost like

224
00:23:04.32 --> 00:23:10.16
I want to throw up. And I did it feel consciously nervous, but obviously, we're obviously, yeah,

225
00:23:10.16 --> 00:23:14.16
my body was like, I wouldn't like throw up, but I had a weird gag thing and he'd be like,

226
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:18.08
don't start their shit now. And actually, know what though, what I messed up here is that this is,

227
00:23:18.96 --> 00:23:23.36
I don't think I said it's not. It is fear. I was going to say maybe this is just about fatigue,

228
00:23:23.36 --> 00:23:27.12
because it says fatigue causes fear. I was thinking that this was just fatigue, but no,

229
00:23:27.12 --> 00:23:31.84
this is actually just what fear does to you. Some psychological reactions to inability to

230
00:23:31.84 --> 00:23:35.60
make decisions, obsession with minor details, oh, I've seen that before.

231
00:23:37.28 --> 00:23:46.24
Lack of confidence, breakdown of discipline. You've in in psychology for the incompetence,

232
00:23:46.24 --> 00:23:52.48
military incompetence. He talked about how some leaders would become obsessed with details.

233
00:23:52.48 --> 00:23:57.20
Good, that's because they were just scared. Oh, we need to do this again. Let me go. Let me get

234
00:23:57.20 --> 00:24:03.68
her. Yeah. Yeah. Something I want you out for. Some extreme reactions to fear occur when the

235
00:24:03.68 --> 00:24:09.68
individual has confronted a situation where death appears to be imminent during such instances,

236
00:24:09.68 --> 00:24:16.64
two basic forms of behavior have been observed. Aggression and rage, one freezing under fire, two.

237
00:24:18.32 --> 00:24:24.56
Going to some details, aggression and rage from combat motivation by Anthony Kelet was this

238
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:28.80
statement from a German soldier on the eastern front during World War II describing how German

239
00:24:28.80 --> 00:24:33.92
soldiers reacted when overrun by Russian hordes. The quote below describes aggression and rage,

240
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:39.12
we fault like rats, which do not hesitate to spring with all their teeth buried when they are

241
00:24:39.12 --> 00:24:45.84
cornered by a man infinitely larger than they are. And then freezing under fire, the other

242
00:24:45.84 --> 00:24:51.12
and the spectrum from Medikas fire by Assela Marshall came the term freezing under,

243
00:24:51.12 --> 00:24:58.72
writing about action in Omaha Beach, World War II, the Copa low describes freezing under fire.

244
00:24:58.72 --> 00:25:04.24
They sat there numbly in the line of fire, their minds blanked out, their fingers to

245
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:10.24
nerveless to hold the weapon. Fighter flight, that's what we're talking about.

246
00:25:12.16 --> 00:25:18.96
And here's some conditions that stimulate fear. You got to overcome your own fears,

247
00:25:18.96 --> 00:25:23.60
though you share the same risks in fear. You must be able to overcome your own fear and provide

248
00:25:23.60 --> 00:25:29.60
the leadership necessary to achieve success in combat. The Marines you lead are your Marines.

249
00:25:29.60 --> 00:25:34.000
You've lived, trained, sweated and grown into an effective fighting unit together.

250
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.40
Before you face a violent brutal and cunning enemy, you must understand the conditions that

251
00:25:38.40 --> 00:25:43.12
stimulate fear, inspire confidence and encourage in and encourage in your Marines.

252
00:25:43.12 --> 00:25:49.52
This is a quote here from Battle Leadership Captain Vaughn Shell, which we've covered on

253
00:25:49.52 --> 00:25:54.64
white. I don't know, maybe the fourth or fifth podcast here. In peace, we learn how to lead

254
00:25:54.64 --> 00:26:00.08
companies, battians, regiments, even divisions and armies. We learn in books and by maps how one

255
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:04.72
fights and wins battles, but we are not instructed in the thoughts, the hopes, the fears that

256
00:26:04.72 --> 00:26:07.60
run riot in the mind of the front lines soldier.

257
00:26:07.60 --> 00:26:17.76
There are three conditions that stimulate fear, unexpected unknown and feelings of helplessness.

258
00:26:19.60 --> 00:26:26.64
That's a good breakdown. Yes, it is unexpected. Well, unknown and helplessness of

259
00:26:26.64 --> 00:26:33.52
whole. And I think that's the tired part where tired fatigue is like part of fear.

260
00:26:33.52 --> 00:26:39.20
Yeah, because you know you're going to be helpless. Straight up. Unexpected.

261
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:45.92
Enemy actions that appear as a surprise will have a powerful impact upon your Marines.

262
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.16
Being surprised by the enemy has been described as causing the quote, will that control's fear

263
00:26:52.80 --> 00:26:59.76
to sag and crumble. When your Marines begin to sense that they do not have control over

264
00:26:59.76 --> 00:27:07.20
their situation, they may begin to panic at such moments. You must exert a strong influence upon them

265
00:27:07.20 --> 00:27:09.76
to maintain control over the unit's actions.

266
00:27:12.16 --> 00:27:17.84
Surprises a big deal. I can't help but think of this. I also think of the other end of the

267
00:27:17.84 --> 00:27:23.44
spectrum. The opposite end of the spectrum, which is what you want to impose surprise on your enemy.

268
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:29.92
Right, you want to. That's one of the speed surprising violence of action. One of the

269
00:27:29.92 --> 00:27:36.96
models of the seal teams and really have combat in general. Because that's what it does. It's the

270
00:27:36.96 --> 00:27:42.56
same thing. And you know, like on the mats. That's a surprise thing. That's when you get caught.

271
00:27:43.52 --> 00:27:49.68
Unknown. Your Marines will worry about what they have not seen and what they do not know.

272
00:27:49.68 --> 00:27:55.04
You will have a tendency to think the enemy is much greater in strength than ability, but

273
00:27:55.04 --> 00:27:59.92
really is not. Do not be deceived as to enemy strength or capabilities to exaggerate it in

274
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:04.40
impressions. This is Mikey in the dragons. The dragons you think the dragons are all

275
00:28:04.40 --> 00:28:09.68
being big and scary, but they're not. And this is something important to think about. Because

276
00:28:09.68 --> 00:28:14.56
the context here is like, hey, you're leading troops and they're scared of the enemy. They're

277
00:28:14.56 --> 00:28:19.12
scared of your competitor. They think the competitors got all the advantages. They don't.

278
00:28:22.72 --> 00:28:29.36
Feelings of helplessness. You. And it's got that capitalized. You must prevent this from

279
00:28:29.36 --> 00:28:35.92
taking hold. Act to direct and inspire the response against the enemy. Everyone has a job that

280
00:28:35.92 --> 00:28:41.04
must be accomplished. Ensure that everyone is doing what must be done. And this is key.

281
00:28:41.04 --> 00:28:47.68
Action is a way to prevent this condition from taking hold. Keep your Marines busy. Now look,

282
00:28:47.68 --> 00:28:53.68
I don't like saying keep people busy. And they do actually talk about this a decent amount in this

283
00:28:53.68 --> 00:29:01.28
book, but I have to admit that it is true. The same thing that causes an individual to get obsessed

284
00:29:01.28 --> 00:29:06.08
with some details is the same thing when you're teet. They're trying to distract their mind from

285
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:15.20
what's going on. So you can actually utilize activity to prevent this. But also, so there's one

286
00:29:15.20 --> 00:29:19.20
thing like, oh, I can see that Ecos nervous about tomorrow. Hey, Ecos, can you do me favor and

287
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:27.44
help me load up the vehicles with water? And you're like, okay, because now you're thinking about that.

288
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:33.20
That's one part of it. Like almost that administrative part of it. But then also, if there's

289
00:29:33.20 --> 00:29:40.000
something happening, for if we're in a gunfight and you start freaking out or you start looking

290
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.92
scared, you know, it's echo, get over there, pick up security in that door. Okay, now you got something

291
00:29:43.92 --> 00:29:52.000
to do. You got, you know, so there's an administrative way to do it. And there's also an active moment

292
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.52
to actually give people direction. And as soon as we're taking action, we're moving in the

293
00:29:57.52 --> 00:30:02.24
right direction. We're moving in the right direction for taking action. One of the worst things we

294
00:30:02.24 --> 00:30:06.88
can do is let the team sit there and dwell over what's unfolding around us. Let's do something.

295
00:30:10.64 --> 00:30:18.72
There's an example in here. He was firing behind a log. His face was gray. His eyes were dull

296
00:30:18.72 --> 00:30:24.16
and without hope. He stopped firing and looked around. It didn't do any good. He said,

297
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:30.56
his voice was flat and he was speaking to no one in particular. I got three of them, but did do any

298
00:30:30.56 --> 00:30:39.68
good. They just kept coming. They just keep coming. Platoon sergeant, Kazimere, Palakowski,

299
00:30:40.40 --> 00:30:48.000
known as ski. Said, what the hell are you beefing at? You get paid for it. Don't you? The kid

300
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.92
managed to grin as ski crawled on down the line. The boy, now a man, was once more squeezing them off.

301
00:30:55.92 --> 00:31:03.84
That's from a book called Guadalcanal Diary, Richard Trugaskis,

302
00:31:07.12 --> 00:31:12.16
leadership role. Additionally, the first shock of realizing that the enemy actually

303
00:31:12.16 --> 00:31:17.04
intends to kill you is a powerful factor that everyone will face. Until this threshold is crossed

304
00:31:17.04 --> 00:31:23.04
and your marines become accustomed to the to functioning under fire, you must act decisively

305
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:28.96
to ignite the confidence and individual actions that will transform fear into an aggressive response.

306
00:31:29.76 --> 00:31:34.56
Your presence as a leader has tremendous value in overcoming fear, particularly at night,

307
00:31:34.56 --> 00:31:40.56
adverse weather, or during loll's in the action. During these times, imaginations run wild.

308
00:31:41.44 --> 00:31:48.72
And your marines think they may be alone or isolated. So again, taking action and

309
00:31:48.72 --> 00:31:55.60
influencing there to be action in these moments when people are nervous or scared,

310
00:31:55.60 --> 00:32:00.80
that's a great move to overcome fear. Next section is stresses of combat.

311
00:32:01.84 --> 00:32:06.72
And again, these are extreme examples. This is combat examples, but there's stress in every job,

312
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:08.88
there's stress in every business, there's stress in life.

313
00:32:12.64 --> 00:32:15.12
Killing the enemy that's trying to kill you is only half the battle.

314
00:32:15.12 --> 00:32:22.96
To your marines and during discomfort fatigue and the other hazards and stresses of combat

315
00:32:22.96 --> 00:32:28.32
is what must be done so that they can succeed in combat. Sources of stress in combat fatigue,

316
00:32:28.32 --> 00:32:35.04
discomfort casualties boredom. As you become for fatigue, as you become increasingly tired,

317
00:32:35.04 --> 00:32:38.80
you will lose the ability to make decisions rapidly. You will become more easily confused,

318
00:32:38.80 --> 00:32:44.72
disoriented and ultimately ineffective. You must understand the effects of fatigue on yourself

319
00:32:44.72 --> 00:32:50.16
and your marines and when to provide for rest, especially amidst the chaos of battle.

320
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.40
Here's some key indicators of fatigue, reckless disregard for safety yourself,

321
00:32:56.40 --> 00:33:02.32
of self or fellow marines, excessive caution or unwillingness to expose oneself to risk,

322
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:06.80
failure to fire weapons, lack of concern for the condition of weapons or other equipment,

323
00:33:06.80 --> 00:33:14.40
lack of concern for personal clenliness. So all those things are what we need to watch out for as leaders,

324
00:33:15.04 --> 00:33:17.12
when people are not engaged anymore.

325
00:33:21.36 --> 00:33:26.80
Develop, here's some things you can do, develop a sleep plan for your unit that to ensure that everyone

326
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:33.60
including yourself gets a minimum of four hours of sleep per day, situation permitted.

327
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:39.84
Rest is preventative treatment that keeps senseless casualties from occurring.

328
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:44.80
So there you go, Aquatrolse. Making sure, I want you to make sure you get four hours.

329
00:33:47.20 --> 00:33:56.88
Listen for those people that are freak out because I wake up early and think I hate sleep.

330
00:33:56.88 --> 00:34:01.84
I don't hate sleep. Sleep is good for you. You should sleep a bunch. It's when you heal.

331
00:34:01.84 --> 00:34:06.72
It's when you get strong. It's how you maintain your mental and physical health.

332
00:34:08.48 --> 00:34:12.40
So you should sleep and you should sleep a lot. Which is why I thought it was kind of funny that they said,

333
00:34:12.40 --> 00:34:17.44
hey, look, hey, Adam minimum, you've got to get four hours. I will say that's a number, though,

334
00:34:17.44 --> 00:34:24.80
in extreme situations. Four hours is like something that you can maintain,

335
00:34:24.80 --> 00:34:30.72
functional for a long period of time. I know I can. Under four hours and it starts to chip away

336
00:34:30.72 --> 00:34:35.60
at me after a while. But if I can sleep for four hours, I'm kind of stoked.

337
00:34:38.24 --> 00:34:42.48
No, I know not normal day, normal day to day life. I sleep like six hours.

338
00:34:43.76 --> 00:34:48.64
Because that's what the body needs. Some people say eight, some people it's five, you know, different.

339
00:34:50.80 --> 00:34:57.44
Marines adversely suffering from the effects of being cold, wet, hungry thirst, your weary will determine

340
00:34:57.44 --> 00:35:01.12
their ability to fight well. Marines tend to develop a high tolerance for

341
00:35:01.12 --> 00:35:05.92
enduring the extremes of weather without much support. However, there is a point where morale is

342
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:09.20
affected and your units actual ability to fight becomes questionable.

343
00:35:12.24 --> 00:35:16.24
At the first opportunity provide dry clothing protection from the elements food and water.

344
00:35:17.12 --> 00:35:17.76
There you go.

345
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:28.80
So sources of stress in combat, the following excerpt from battle at best by SLA Marshall describes

346
00:35:28.80 --> 00:35:32.48
how taken care of your Marines pays its dividends in combat.

347
00:35:35.36 --> 00:35:41.20
And again, we covered SLA Marshall on this podcast. I forget what number and there's some

348
00:35:41.20 --> 00:35:48.80
definite concerns with the veracity of him and some of the information that he put out.

349
00:35:48.80 --> 00:35:52.40
But as I said, when we covered on the podcast, don't throw out the baby with the bath water.

350
00:35:54.64 --> 00:35:56.24
This is a really interesting case.

351
00:35:58.08 --> 00:36:05.20
At dark on eight December, the snowfall ceased and the cold intensified. Down along the canyon road,

352
00:36:05.20 --> 00:36:09.76
near the water gate, a brisk wind was piling the drifts as high as a man's head.

353
00:36:09.76 --> 00:36:16.08
At the battalion CP, which was partly sheltered by the canyon wall, the thermometer red

354
00:36:16.72 --> 00:36:18.64
30 degrees below zero.

355
00:36:20.48 --> 00:36:26.48
Up on the wind swept cracks where Abel Company was clearing Chinese dead from the bunkers to make

356
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:32.56
room for its own ranks. And at the same time, preparing to evacuate its own casualties down the

357
00:36:32.56 --> 00:36:40.56
iced slopes of the mountains, it must have been a touch colder than that, though there was no reading

358
00:36:40.56 --> 00:36:49.04
of the temperature. All batteries had frozen. Weapons were stiffening. The camp long since had run out

359
00:36:49.04 --> 00:36:55.92
of water because the freezing of cantines. To ease their thirst, the men ate snow and seemed to thrive on it.

360
00:36:56.96 --> 00:37:02.16
But of the many problems raised by the weather, the most severe one was getting an average good

361
00:37:02.16 --> 00:37:08.88
man to observe what the field manual so easily described as a, quote, common sense precaution.

362
00:37:10.48 --> 00:37:17.92
For example, prior to marching, Captain Barrow of Abel made certain that each of his men carried

363
00:37:17.92 --> 00:37:24.32
two spare pairs of socks. But that safeguard did not of itself ensure his force,

364
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:31.44
though the men with feet, swedded from the rigors of the day were all at the point of

365
00:37:31.44 --> 00:37:38.64
becoming frostbite casualties by the hour of the Bivowack. And here's what Captain Barrow said.

366
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:45.60
I learned that night that only leadership will save men under winter conditions.

367
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:51.60
It's easy to say that men should change socks, getting it done as another matter.

368
00:37:51.60 --> 00:37:57.12
Boothlaces become iced over during prolonged engagements and snowdrifs.

369
00:37:58.16 --> 00:38:04.56
It's a fight to get a boot off the foot. When a man removes his gloves to struggle with the

370
00:38:04.56 --> 00:38:09.92
laces, it seems to him that his hands are freezing. His impulses all against it.

371
00:38:11.04 --> 00:38:17.60
So I found it necessary to do this by order, staying with the individuals until they had

372
00:38:17.60 --> 00:38:22.64
changed, then making them get up and move about to restore circulation.

373
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.72
That process, simple in the telling consumed hours, by the time Barrow was satisfied that his command

374
00:38:30.72 --> 00:38:35.68
was relatively snug. It was wearing on toward midnight. Right then, his perimeter was hit by

375
00:38:35.68 --> 00:38:41.04
a counterattack and enemy force and puttune strength plus striking along the ridge line

376
00:38:41.04 --> 00:38:48.40
from a prop from 1081 in approximately the same formation which Barrow had used during the afternoon.

377
00:38:48.96 --> 00:38:53.84
All that needs to be told of his small action is summed up in Barrow's brief radio report.

378
00:38:53.84 --> 00:38:57.04
They hit us, we killed them all, all that we could see.

379
00:38:58.40 --> 00:39:01.60
We have countered 18 fresh bodies just outside our lines.

380
00:39:03.68 --> 00:39:07.12
By the way, this is Captain Barrow that became the 27th Commodant.

381
00:39:07.12 --> 00:39:16.32
So he had to go person to person and physically make sure they were doing exactly what he told

382
00:39:16.32 --> 00:39:22.80
them to do. Because the tendency is to curl up into a ball and die.

383
00:39:24.08 --> 00:39:31.60
And we covered some of the prison camps in Korea and that that individual

384
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:38.80
specifically talked about that decision. Is there was people that just gave up and they're not

385
00:39:38.80 --> 00:39:42.80
going to do anything else and they're not going to try and they just accept the death.

386
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:45.28
And the guys that live for the guys that said, no, I'm not going to give up.

387
00:39:46.88 --> 00:39:51.68
But these little things, like, you know, your feet are sweating and your socks are wet

388
00:39:51.68 --> 00:39:55.04
from working all day, climbing up this mountain and then you get up there and you're going to

389
00:39:55.04 --> 00:39:57.92
be up there for a while. You have to change your socks or a little too. You're going to freeze.

390
00:39:57.92 --> 00:40:05.04
And your ice is our laced up and it's colder than 30 degrees below zero.

391
00:40:10.80 --> 00:40:15.76
There's another source of stress in combat casualties. Seeing a fellow Marine go down has a

392
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:21.44
traumatic impact upon you and your Marines brutal combat as brutal and casualties are to be

393
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:26.72
expected. The shock of seeing your buddies wounded or killed in a possibility that may happen to them

394
00:40:26.72 --> 00:40:32.32
adds the fear and apprehension of the survivors. It increases your Marines reluctance to take risks

395
00:40:32.32 --> 00:40:38.24
and obey you. How individuals respond after their units taken casualties is a key indicator of

396
00:40:38.24 --> 00:40:44.72
their effectiveness of their training, self-discipline and preparation for combat.

397
00:40:48.40 --> 00:40:53.12
Proper care for your wounded has a great effect upon morale, assuring your Marines that if they

398
00:40:53.12 --> 00:40:57.44
are hit, their fellow Marines will take care of them. There's an unwritten code among Marines that

399
00:40:57.44 --> 00:41:01.60
if wounded and unable to defend for yourself another Marine will come to your aid. And look,

400
00:41:01.60 --> 00:41:06.48
that exists in the Marine Corps, but that should exist in your team too. Your organization,

401
00:41:06.48 --> 00:41:10.88
someone has a problem, someone has an issue, someone has a sick kid, someone has a they get sick

402
00:41:10.88 --> 00:41:17.76
themselves and you take care of them. That's going to help them. It's going to it's going to bring

403
00:41:17.76 --> 00:41:23.68
your unit closer together. Says your Marines need to recognize that the quicker they take the

404
00:41:23.68 --> 00:41:28.96
objective, the quicker their fallen comrades get help. Stopping to take care of your fellow

405
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:34.000
Marines during the assault will bog down the unit. During the assault Marines cannot stop to

406
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.72
aid a fallen comrades. The corpsmen will take care of the casualties in the best possible manner

407
00:41:38.72 --> 00:41:45.12
until you are able to send for help. That's something we learn basically day one, win the fight.

408
00:41:45.12 --> 00:41:53.20
That's also a prioritized next-cute scenario. That's probably the first prioritized and execute

409
00:41:53.20 --> 00:42:02.64
thing that I ever learned. You got to win the fight. At the first opportunity leaders and

410
00:42:02.64 --> 00:42:06.88
comrades should look for casualties every Marine must be accounted for dead and wounded are

411
00:42:06.88 --> 00:42:13.20
removed from the combat area as soon as possible. And it's got a section here about boredom. In combat,

412
00:42:13.20 --> 00:42:18.32
the squad leadership fight inactivity and boredom with the same tenacity used against enemy troops.

413
00:42:19.12 --> 00:42:24.16
That might be a bit strong. Look, I don't want my troops to be bored, but I'm going to be more

414
00:42:24.16 --> 00:42:30.000
tenacious against the enemy than I am against boredom. The boredom and that inactivity produces

415
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.72
can negatively impact your squad if they become complacent. When the time comes, when the time

416
00:42:34.72 --> 00:42:41.44
for combat comes, this inactivity may result in a less effective unit. And there's another thing,

417
00:42:41.44 --> 00:42:49.12
this one thing that I think is good to think about. If you push somebody, if you're giving

418
00:42:49.12 --> 00:42:54.40
someone something to do, kind of making almost making it up. Not quite, but like, hey, we're

419
00:42:54.40 --> 00:42:57.92
going to run this battle drill again. Hey, we're going to do another briefing. Hey, we're going to

420
00:42:57.92 --> 00:43:01.84
review this. Hey, we're going to maintain our weapons again. If you're doing that kind of stuff,

421
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:10.96
you should give them a time for, hey, right now we got an hour, relax. You should give them a

422
00:43:10.96 --> 00:43:18.56
specific amount of time to stand down, to relax, to take a knee, whatever. I think that is

423
00:43:18.56 --> 00:43:25.28
important too. If you're trying to keep them busy all the time, that's not smart. You need to find

424
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:30.000
a moment to go, okay, hey, we got a half an hour, everybody, take your, take your rock off for

425
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:39.84
relax. Yeah, it's so you hear, it says keep your Marines occupied by delivering intelligence briefs

426
00:43:39.84 --> 00:43:43.92
reviewing the rules of engagement, rehearsing immediate action drills during the walls and pace of

427
00:43:43.92 --> 00:43:49.04
operations by doing so, so you prevent disciplinary problems by turning your squads, thoughts away from

428
00:43:49.04 --> 00:43:56.24
themselves to the work at hand. Again, good. Yes, I like it. I agree with it. However, comma,

429
00:43:56.24 --> 00:44:03.44
you got to give people a little bit of downtime. Is that kind of parallel, whatever, to the idea

430
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:09.84
of, okay, so you go to the gym, we'll say, right? So let's say you want to go to the gym after work,

431
00:44:10.72 --> 00:44:17.20
not before, right, after work. So if you, let's say as a routine, you go from work, you get off work,

432
00:44:17.20 --> 00:44:24.32
and then you go straight to the gym. That's better. Then going home first, decompressing a little bit,

433
00:44:24.32 --> 00:44:30.32
then going into the gym, right? You know, I don't know if what you're talking about is the same thing,

434
00:44:30.32 --> 00:44:34.64
but it's 100% true. I think so though, because they're, you know, when you get like,

435
00:44:34.64 --> 00:44:39.60
downtime or whatever, like too much downtime, essentially, right? Like where it's not like you have to

436
00:44:39.60 --> 00:44:43.68
rest in recover from work to go to the gym, unless you do, and that's a whole different thing.

437
00:44:43.68 --> 00:44:48.48
Yeah. I'm talking about the idea that you come home from your office, you know, and you're physically

438
00:44:48.48 --> 00:44:53.76
not exhausted, maybe mentally or, but whatever, you go straight to the gym, because you don't

439
00:44:53.76 --> 00:45:00.40
give your mind, just like I always said, a chance to think about like yourself, like how

440
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:05.12
am I feeling that man, the mood, and it's like, it kind of creeps up on you, you know, when you have

441
00:45:05.12 --> 00:45:09.12
that downtime. But if you go straight to the gym, you're like, hey, we're still, we're still moving,

442
00:45:09.12 --> 00:45:15.76
you know, you don't get a chance to get that true. That is accurate. And then if you take that to the

443
00:45:15.76 --> 00:45:20.40
extreme where you also, and you're not going to be rested all the time, then you got to watch out

444
00:45:20.40 --> 00:45:26.000
for that. Yeah, that's almost like the idea that let's say your job is like super physically demanding.

445
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.04
Like, you're like, what would you say to drywall hanger or something?

446
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:32.24
Drywall hanger is getting after it? Yeah, well, that's one that you said you did,

447
00:45:32.24 --> 00:45:36.72
well, you know, either way, let's say you did, you know, 11, 12 hours a day. That's for, let's say

448
00:45:36.72 --> 00:45:43.04
roofers. roofers. Yeah. And hot sun, even. Boom. Okay, go home, take a little snooze or even.

449
00:45:43.04 --> 00:45:46.88
Then hit the gym. You can be kind of like refreshed little bit. I bet you'd be better off

450
00:45:46.88 --> 00:45:51.20
just going straight there. Sometimes I think so something. I think there's plenty of people here at

451
00:45:51.20 --> 00:45:55.44
our gym where they're coming off of a long day of working construction and then it's like right

452
00:45:55.44 --> 00:46:00.96
on to the mats, you know, I think it's a better move. Well, I would, for me, it's a better move.

453
00:46:00.96 --> 00:46:07.68
Mentally, it's a better move, I think. Yeah. Physically, you go recover a little bit. That's what I think.

454
00:46:07.68 --> 00:46:11.52
But you're driving here. You know, you got like half an hour, whatever. That's what I'm saying.

455
00:46:11.52 --> 00:46:15.36
Mentally, but because when you're driving here, you're thinking about training more than

456
00:46:15.36 --> 00:46:21.28
you're thinking about relaxing. I'll tell you that. You go home. Have a snack. Turn on the TV.

457
00:46:21.28 --> 00:46:25.44
Just for a little bit. You're letting the window close. That was the one of the conversations we

458
00:46:25.44 --> 00:46:30.000
once had was you're letting that window close. Yeah. Oh, let's get a little bit smaller. Oh,

459
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.16
can't make it. Oh, you know, I got a little too busy. Sometimes my wife will wake up early.

460
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:45.92
Yeah. And like, there's that, you know, whatever that gravity of, you know, she's, oh, you know,

461
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:52.08
talking to me and stuff. All right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But we have workouts to do. You know?

462
00:46:54.40 --> 00:46:58.72
Yes. And that's like I'll come back down to the house to like grab some more water or something.

463
00:46:58.72 --> 00:47:04.56
Mm-hmm. Because I'm in my garage, you know, and then I go back down to like grab some water

464
00:47:05.28 --> 00:47:10.56
and she's awake. And she's just having a cup of tea because she's from the world. Yeah.

465
00:47:10.56 --> 00:47:14.32
And she's there. Oh, my one. And there's that gravity, you know,

466
00:47:15.04 --> 00:47:19.12
kind of wish she honestly no offense to my wife kind of wish she wasn't away. Because I kind of want

467
00:47:19.12 --> 00:47:23.84
to like hang out with her bed, you know, and I have to not. Oh, yeah. That's real. That's real.

468
00:47:23.84 --> 00:47:28.48
Even with us when we show up here, whatever we're going to talk about some stuff, you know,

469
00:47:28.48 --> 00:47:33.04
do this, do that. Yeah. The workout thing, especially with your wife because they're even if you don't

470
00:47:33.04 --> 00:47:40.48
want to talk to your wife. Mm-hmm. I'm not saying that's my key. Maybe, maybe,

471
00:47:40.48 --> 00:47:44.96
even either way, even if you don't want to talk to her. I'm pathetic. But that you do. You can't just

472
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:49.68
disrespect her and be like, yeah, cool story. I'm busy. She knows what you're doing. You're working

473
00:47:49.68 --> 00:47:54.48
out. Take a minute. Talk to me on your wife. You know, for better words, all this stuff. And

474
00:47:54.48 --> 00:47:58.96
you're over here, just disney me for like some curls or whatever you're doing it, you seem

475
00:47:58.96 --> 00:48:04.32
saying. And that's what it really does feel like when you're doing it. So yeah, I can jam you on.

476
00:48:05.52 --> 00:48:09.92
Oh, my wife sleeps. I like going, she would. I like when she sleeps a little later. You

477
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:17.12
don't get to get to her rest. Yeah, it's a rest. I do get to get some rest. Success and combat. The

478
00:48:17.12 --> 00:48:21.12
focus of this study unit is to teach you the important factors of leadership so you can

479
00:48:21.12 --> 00:48:26.96
perform better as a leader in both peace, time and in combat. The way that you respond to these leadership

480
00:48:26.96 --> 00:48:35.04
challenges is crucial to achieving success and combat factors to success. As an infantry squad leader,

481
00:48:35.68 --> 00:48:43.04
you control the lives of 12 Marines. They look to you for instruction and guidance. This part is

482
00:48:43.04 --> 00:48:50.88
important. You're most casual remark will be remembered. You're clothing, vocabulary, and

483
00:48:50.88 --> 00:49:01.36
method of leadership will be imitated. They're listening and it has impact. When you start making

484
00:49:01.36 --> 00:49:07.44
little crack and jokes about the LT, those jokes have a lot more impact when they're coming from you

485
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:14.88
as a squad leader. The LT, the Lieutenant. Oh, God. When you're cracking jokes about the VP of sales,

486
00:49:14.88 --> 00:49:22.80
your little sales team is that those have more impact than you think. This is something I

487
00:49:22.80 --> 00:49:28.40
was had to be careful to. When I went from being maybe it's even to this day. When I went

488
00:49:28.40 --> 00:49:34.48
from being an E5 and a Poutune E5 mafia where everybody is a target. Everybody in the entire

489
00:49:34.48 --> 00:49:41.44
chain of command is a target for ridicule. And then all of a sudden when I became an officer,

490
00:49:41.44 --> 00:49:47.04
assistant, Poutune Commander, Poutune Commander, I had to freaking dial that back. You just can't

491
00:49:47.04 --> 00:49:53.60
be going drop a Napalm on that chain of command over every little thing. And it's tempting because

492
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:59.28
it's funny and that's what you're used to. I had to dial that back. Lafel was cracks up when I

493
00:49:59.28 --> 00:50:07.28
go like go E5 on somebody. I start dropping the hammer on someone. Yeah. Hey, this is a side note case.

494
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:14.48
So you always talk about that like the E5. It's like a thing. Yeah. E5 mafia. And I've heard of

495
00:50:14.48 --> 00:50:22.96
E4. I think in the E6 of course. What's with E5? That sounds to me that sounds pretty high.

496
00:50:22.96 --> 00:50:27.28
Like there's E1 right? Is there any one? Yeah there's E1 but you're not a new one for very long.

497
00:50:27.28 --> 00:50:31.44
You're like in boot camp, you're new one. You're probably going to make E2 out of boot camp. E3

498
00:50:31.44 --> 00:50:37.52
you should be pretty much you know within maybe I don't know a year. Yeah. Then you're E4. So now

499
00:50:37.52 --> 00:50:42.48
you could be E4 for like a few a couple years, you know maybe two or three years. So you're

500
00:50:43.12 --> 00:50:47.04
you may or may not have done the deployment. And this is also back in the day. Guys make

501
00:50:47.04 --> 00:50:59.20
rank faster now than we did. So back in the day, the E6 was a leadership position. E5 was the

502
00:50:59.20 --> 00:51:06.32
boys and the new guys were kind of E4s. Maybe even E3s occasionally. So essentially I don't think

503
00:51:06.32 --> 00:51:13.04
there's an E3 in a seal puttune today at all. I don't think there is. I think there's barely any

504
00:51:13.04 --> 00:51:18.08
E4s. It's mostly E5s and now you have multiple E6s in a puttune. But back in the day,

505
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:24.000
an E6 was an LPO. He was the leading patty officer. Then you had a chief patty officer. Then you had

506
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.60
this as a puttune commander and a puttune commander. So you had those were the senior people. We

507
00:51:29.60 --> 00:51:35.84
called him the top four. And then you had new guys. You had four or five new guys, which were

508
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:41.12
probably E3s. No, they were probably E4s maybe and E3. And then you had the group in the middle.

509
00:51:41.84 --> 00:51:49.84
And these were the E5 mob. So they were there at not when you say they're E6's leadership position.

510
00:51:49.84 --> 00:51:56.24
So E5 is not only like they're not anyone's boss. They're just they're just now they might be one

511
00:51:56.24 --> 00:52:01.84
per- they might be a new guys boss. Like when I was an E5 mobster, I had an E4. That was a new guy

512
00:52:01.84 --> 00:52:06.24
that was a radio man. Yeah. You see what I was saying? Yeah. I'm trying to try and

513
00:52:06.24 --> 00:52:11.12
draw a comparison. And actually part of the time I was an E5 mobfie. I was an E4. Because I didn't

514
00:52:11.12 --> 00:52:19.60
make E5 very rapidly. So yeah. But that E5 mobfie is like the people that are doing the

515
00:52:19.60 --> 00:52:23.20
work. Right. Like when you were a balancer, how many balancers were there?

516
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:29.84
Uh, I don't know. 15. Okay. This is it. Now one of them was in charge, right? Yeah. Maybe two of them.

517
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:34.88
Hey, this guy's in charge of the shuffling. So those guys are in charge of the Zip. Then you had a couple

518
00:52:35.28 --> 00:52:40.64
like new guys at kind of Soctr or whatever. Yeah. But then you had a core group of guys that kind of

519
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:44.40
if you could say something, people are going to have to listen. Yeah. There you go. That's three five

520
00:52:44.40 --> 00:52:49.84
off. Yeah. You know what it was? And now that I'm thinking of it, it's, there's the door guys. They're all

521
00:52:49.84 --> 00:52:54.64
called door guys. But the guys who worked the front door, which is usually the one and two. And then

522
00:52:54.64 --> 00:53:00.72
like kind of a guy who would switch out. Someone who's doing well. But then there's the rest of the

523
00:53:00.72 --> 00:53:05.76
guys who worked, you know, inside. And then yes, there were like new guys who were like still learning

524
00:53:05.76 --> 00:53:12.24
like camera. Yeah. Who, yes. And kind of the same thing where you could tell them, hey, go change the

525
00:53:12.24 --> 00:53:16.88
toilet paper in the bathroom. Yeah. You know, like go do the worst. Yeah. Exactly. Right. So yeah,

526
00:53:16.88 --> 00:53:21.04
I get, I got you. Yeah. But you five is kind of high in those. What I'm saying. It's like,

527
00:53:21.04 --> 00:53:29.92
well, I can tell, no, it's not kind of high. But in a seal platoon, you're a men level. But you're

528
00:53:29.92 --> 00:53:36.64
kind of just a shooter too. You know, you don't, you're not one of the top four. So it's not like

529
00:53:36.64 --> 00:53:41.52
kind of high. And right now, everybody, I think I think everybody in the seal teams right now is

530
00:53:41.52 --> 00:53:46.40
an E5. If you make it through Buds, I think you'd be culmining E5. It's kind of legit, you know,

531
00:53:47.12 --> 00:53:50.96
back in the day, because I know that's all right, brother. You're an E3. You're an E4.

532
00:53:51.52 --> 00:53:57.04
Back in the day, if you want to ship in your E3, you had to work in the dishwasher for three months.

533
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:01.92
And we did one to point, we had an E3 in our platoon. And we somehow got him out of it.

534
00:54:02.80 --> 00:54:10.64
Got him out of doing that. But I was an E4 for my second platoon. So even though I should have been

535
00:54:10.64 --> 00:54:15.52
an E5 or I was an E5 mafia, but even then even in that platoon,

536
00:54:17.84 --> 00:54:23.84
there's a bunch of E4s. And we were on the E5 mafia. It's an E stand for enlisted. And then if you're an

537
00:54:23.84 --> 00:54:29.44
officer, it's an O. So you got O1, that's an instant. O2 is a lieutenant junior grade. See, that's weird.

538
00:54:29.44 --> 00:54:35.52
I've never heard of O anything. All I heard was E. I think I've even heard of E1, E233. Yeah,

539
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:45.20
because people talk smack about the O. That guy's an E1. And then you become in the navy, O3 is

540
00:54:45.76 --> 00:54:52.32
lieutenant. And then O4 is lieutenant commander. But in the army, that same rank is called a major.

541
00:54:53.44 --> 00:55:01.84
So when in Ramadi, the army guys, they would a lot of army guys was called the major. So then

542
00:55:01.84 --> 00:55:11.28
some of the, some of my guys would call me the mage. And then captain is it very high or it is

543
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:19.76
captain in the army and the Marine Corps is an O4. Captain, or sorry, is an O3 in the army and the

544
00:55:19.76 --> 00:55:29.76
Marine Corps, which is a company commander in charge of 150 guys. Captain in the navy is much higher.

545
00:55:29.76 --> 00:55:38.08
It's an O6. And they could be in charge of multiple ships. So a captain in the navy is

546
00:55:38.08 --> 00:55:44.32
much higher rank than a captain in the army or the Marine Corps. A captain in the navy is a

547
00:55:44.32 --> 00:55:48.88
Colonel, a full bird. You ever heard that expression? Probably in the movies. You hear that full

548
00:55:48.88 --> 00:55:56.000
bird. So a full bird, Colonel, which means they have an eagle on their collar is a full

549
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.72
captain. You don't really say full bird captain because you don't need to. Because the

550
00:56:00.72 --> 00:56:04.56
wood region you say that is in the army and the Marine Corps, you could be a lieutenant

551
00:56:04.56 --> 00:56:10.24
Colonel, which still has a silver oak leaf, which makes you a lieutenant Colonel. So if someone's

552
00:56:10.24 --> 00:56:14.08
got the full bird, that's why you, because you can still call someone that's a lieutenant Colonel,

553
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:18.08
you might just call him Colonel. Because you know, it's a big mouthful to say Colonel.

554
00:56:19.28 --> 00:56:22.72
Or sorry, it's a big mouthful to say lieutenant Colonel. Hey, lieutenant Colonel, what are we

555
00:56:22.72 --> 00:56:26.64
doing? But if you say hey Colonel, that's totally acceptable. So we want to let your boys know like,

556
00:56:26.64 --> 00:56:31.20
hey, this guy's a full bird. Colonel, they deal. Got that full bird. Colonel, coming in.

557
00:56:32.40 --> 00:56:39.52
Yeah, I understand why I understand now why I was so unclear about everything. Because it's like

558
00:56:39.52 --> 00:56:44.40
the same words. Different, you know, armies different than the navy and it's but same words,

559
00:56:44.40 --> 00:56:50.48
you know. Well, sometimes life and Seth would get called captain by army guys, by

560
00:56:50.48 --> 00:56:53.60
mary because that's, you see those two bars like, oh, that's a captain. If you're the army,

561
00:56:53.60 --> 00:56:57.68
that's a captain. Yeah. So you're not thinking lieutenant because the lieutenant is a lower rank.

562
00:57:01.52 --> 00:57:07.68
All right, this section breaks out two things. There are two fundamental types of factors that

563
00:57:07.68 --> 00:57:13.60
affect success and combat. One, factors over which you have a little or no influence that you

564
00:57:13.60 --> 00:57:20.96
must try to understand, endure and explain to your Marines. And number two, factors that you can

565
00:57:20.96 --> 00:57:29.12
influence directly through your leadership. And it goes into a bunch of things. Well, that's

566
00:57:29.12 --> 00:57:32.80
you can't, that you have a little to know influence, political guidelines and rules of engagement,

567
00:57:32.80 --> 00:57:38.08
a valuable ability and quality of replacement, location, weather terrain, public reaction and

568
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:43.20
support, type of conflict, enemy action, duration. You know, control, I'm very little control over

569
00:57:43.20 --> 00:57:47.84
those things. And it goes into talking about the political guidelines,

570
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:54.32
did what your responsible, making sure your Marines abide by them. Here's an important part

571
00:57:54.32 --> 00:57:58.88
of the say, past the chain of command information that might be useful in correcting deficiencies

572
00:57:58.88 --> 00:58:03.20
with rules of engagement procedures. So if you've got some rule of engagement that doesn't

573
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:08.56
make sense, you are responsible for sending that up chain of command. And by the way, if you work

574
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:14.64
in a factory and there's some part of the manufacturing line that doesn't make sense, you are

575
00:58:14.64 --> 00:58:23.04
responsible for running that up the chain so it can get corrected. Little control over who's going

576
00:58:23.04 --> 00:58:29.28
to replace you, obviously, no control, very little control over location terrain, weather.

577
00:58:30.72 --> 00:58:35.04
So it, it list goes into a little bit of detail, well, all those things. And then it goes into

578
00:58:35.04 --> 00:58:42.64
factors that you can influence morale, motivation, discipline, or, pre-decor proficiency.

579
00:58:45.20 --> 00:58:52.40
Morales, the mental and emotional condition, enthusiasm, confidence, or loyalty of an individual

580
00:58:52.40 --> 00:58:56.96
or group with regard to the functions or tasks at hand, the squad leader who taps into this

581
00:58:56.96 --> 00:59:03.36
valuable resource and keeps it to the forefront throughout the adverse conditions of combat will

582
00:59:03.36 --> 00:59:11.84
always prevail. That's a strong word always. Motivation is a by-product of morale.

583
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:16.48
If your Marines are enthusiastic about being part of the squad and have confidence in their squad

584
00:59:16.48 --> 00:59:20.96
leader, then they will have the incentive to drive on through adversity.

585
00:59:24.48 --> 00:59:31.44
Discipline. Discipline is defined in the dictionary as quote to bring under control.

586
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:38.96
In combat, we speak of discipline. In troops, we speak of the Marines ability to disregard

587
00:59:38.96 --> 00:59:45.60
the natural tendencies of self-preservation and at times put them in a harm's way if necessary.

588
00:59:46.32 --> 00:59:49.44
And I would expand on this right now, but they expand on this in a beautiful way.

589
00:59:49.44 --> 00:59:53.60
I'll talk about discipline in a beautiful way coming up. That's pretty cool as the unit spirit

590
00:59:55.04 --> 01:00:00.56
describes how devoted and loyalty are to the team. Proficiency, proficiency is being

591
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:04.80
knowledgeable and skillful in your craft. The imagine a unit being so confident in their ability

592
01:00:04.80 --> 01:00:10.56
to perform that it affects all of the aforementioned factors. Now you have our unit ready to fight.

593
01:00:10.56 --> 01:00:13.44
morale and motivation is the cornerstone of discipline.

594
01:00:14.80 --> 01:00:20.48
Spread your core and proficiency if you instill high morale and motivation in your Marines,

595
01:00:20.48 --> 01:00:26.64
this can lead to success in combat. morale makes up three quarters of the game.

596
01:00:26.64 --> 01:00:31.04
The relative balance of manpower makes up only the remaining quarter. That's the pulling

597
01:00:31.04 --> 01:00:37.68
bone apart. morale makes up three quarters of the game in combat.

598
01:00:39.36 --> 01:00:43.68
You know, that's one of those ones you go, well, yeah, because if you're thinking,

599
01:00:43.68 --> 01:00:47.20
you know, you're football team against another football team and they have great morale,

600
01:00:47.20 --> 01:00:52.56
but you guys are better players, right? Well, it's probably not going to work out too well.

601
01:00:52.56 --> 01:00:56.000
But because this is what I was thinking about last time, I said, well, you know,

602
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.20
where's that going to really carry you in a football game? But then I thought, what if you

603
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:07.28
won't if your football game was played for months? You see what I'm saying? And it wasn't about

604
01:01:07.28 --> 01:01:11.12
how big and strong you were, but it was about, hey, we're going to be, we're going to maneuver

605
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:15.68
faster than you. We're going to walk further than you. We're going to keep working while you're

606
01:01:15.68 --> 01:01:20.16
resting. Like the, we're going to keep our weapons clean. Like all those things, like that's how

607
01:01:20.16 --> 01:01:25.84
you win and all those things have to do with morale. So it might not make a sense in a short

608
01:01:25.84 --> 01:01:34.16
engagement in a physical game. It can have an impact. For sure, I would almost say you were right

609
01:01:34.16 --> 01:01:38.64
to begin with in a football game as far as the example. I mean, you're ready the way, but

610
01:01:39.60 --> 01:01:45.44
if your morale is low, the other team is high, but you have a better football team,

611
01:01:45.44 --> 01:01:49.92
your morale is going to be low for a reason. Like, based essentially like, oh, you know, it's like

612
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:53.84
there's going to be in low morale. It's going to be a lack of confidence. I'm sure there's going to be

613
01:01:53.84 --> 01:01:58.32
a lack of motivation and a corner to book lack of proficiency, which negatively affects your morale.

614
01:01:58.32 --> 01:02:01.92
So you know, you're not that good your morale is about exactly right. So like I said, it's for a

615
01:02:01.92 --> 01:02:06.40
reason. So their morale is good. What if like every your morale, if you're better, quote unquote,

616
01:02:06.40 --> 01:02:09.76
better football team is going to be for a reason. And then whatever that reason is, I don't know,

617
01:02:09.76 --> 01:02:14.88
it's your hypothetical. I don't know, but think of a realistic one. Maybe people are arguing about

618
01:02:14.88 --> 01:02:18.80
this and that. So they're not working together as a team. Both the morale on the team itself,

619
01:02:18.80 --> 01:02:23.76
like what can hurt the morale. Exactly. Right. On the better quote unquote team. Yeah, like you

620
01:02:23.76 --> 01:02:27.68
like you boo a game. Like you boo the last game, like you shouldn't miss the field goal. And you

621
01:02:27.68 --> 01:02:32.16
did and you were better team than them. But then they won, morale could be down. Yeah. And you're arguing

622
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:36.88
with your team, quarterback is blaming everyone. They, you know, maybe they're best guys injured. And

623
01:02:36.88 --> 01:02:41.60
that, you know, now everyone's not as confident and like maybe they're starting, you know,

624
01:02:41.60 --> 01:02:45.12
all this other stuff and they're tired because they've been drinking, you know, all this stuff.

625
01:02:45.12 --> 01:02:50.72
So technically there's, I'm just saying that's a big factor. So so technically they,

626
01:02:50.72 --> 01:02:54.88
they are maybe a better team. But the morale is so low for these were specific reasons. The

627
01:02:54.88 --> 01:02:59.28
other guys have been working hard. They've been got a strategy in place, a secret strategy. I

628
01:02:59.28 --> 01:03:02.88
told you about this one time this team was we were technically better than them, but they were

629
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:06.000
like saying, oh, we're going to kick their ass. We're going to kick their ass. And they're telling

630
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.84
the whole island, essentially, we're going to kick their ass out. What was this was this high school?

631
01:03:09.84 --> 01:03:14.88
Yeah. And I was like, what the, this is uncanny the way they're saying this so much, you know,

632
01:03:14.88 --> 01:03:21.04
and then, but they had a little plan and they did, they beat us to with the plan. It was to do

633
01:03:21.04 --> 01:03:28.64
these weird quarterback keep plays with no huddle. So it's just essentially that that surprise

634
01:03:28.64 --> 01:03:33.68
kind of thing and then just keep going going. So they'd go quarterback keep and we kind of stop

635
01:03:33.68 --> 01:03:37.36
it and they go, no huddle quarterback keep and be like, oh, we're scrambling and we kind of stop it,

636
01:03:37.36 --> 01:03:41.04
but they gave in a little bit more and they just kept doing it kept doing it for the whole, but

637
01:03:41.04 --> 01:03:46.56
didn't you figure out a solution for it after they did it for seven or nine times? I think I was

638
01:03:46.56 --> 01:03:51.92
a two-way. I think our morale went down in that first flurry to be honest with you. I forget how

639
01:03:51.92 --> 01:03:56.72
it's of their morale was high. Very high. They actually beat you. Yeah. For that reason, I'm always surprised

640
01:03:56.72 --> 01:04:03.44
in football that there's not more sneakiness. Yeah. I think a lot of sneakiness, I feel like we

641
01:04:03.44 --> 01:04:08.000
might have talked about this. We've put both of this so much history behind the way plays work

642
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.68
that sneakiness usually comes with an element of risk that's equal. So yeah, if you do this

643
01:04:15.68 --> 01:04:21.92
trick play, there's teams that sort of land towards more sneakiness, but they land more towards

644
01:04:21.92 --> 01:04:27.44
a risk as well. So like one of the mainstream sneaky plays is called the reverse, where it's like

645
01:04:27.44 --> 01:04:31.28
you give the ball, this many ways to do it, but a standard one would be you give the ball to the

646
01:04:31.28 --> 01:04:35.92
running back and an outside run. And instead of keeping running the wider Siever who's wherever

647
01:04:35.92 --> 01:04:38.88
there he comes around this way. So he's acting like he's running and he gets it to the wider Siever

648
01:04:38.88 --> 01:04:42.88
going the other way. So the defense says all this momentum going this way with the ball and the

649
01:04:42.88 --> 01:04:48.08
reverse just comes around with but he's a single guy because he'd have had no blockers. If you

650
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:51.44
had blockers, everyone would see the blockers going over there and they'd be like oh wait, this isn't

651
01:04:51.44 --> 01:04:54.88
you know this so they'd be the rest being that if somebody picks it up and reads it play, then he's

652
01:04:54.88 --> 01:05:00.64
getting annihilated. Probably behind the line because he has no blockers exactly right or what's the one

653
01:05:00.64 --> 01:05:08.88
the um just like a hook and lateral which is a big risk on now and then a pass back to the

654
01:05:08.88 --> 01:05:12.96
quarterback that's another one. We're like you give it to the running back and he runs and he doesn't

655
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:18.88
go past the line. The quarterback does. And the quarterback runs around the other side on a pass pattern

656
01:05:18.88 --> 01:05:24.40
essentially a research so he goes down and then now the running back has to throw the ball to the

657
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:28.24
quarterback which is huge risk by the way, brother, they're going to pick that thing. And the quarterback

658
01:05:28.24 --> 01:05:32.40
got to catch it. Got to catch it. Yes to be open by the way because if he's not open,

659
01:05:32.40 --> 01:05:36.56
he's going to throw it to undunth their wider sheeper usually it's like you know it's like you put your

660
01:05:36.56 --> 01:05:42.56
eggs all in one basket a lot of time and then nowadays people are kind of hip to trick plays so they

661
01:05:42.56 --> 01:05:47.36
kind of wait for it to develop and now the risk goes up you know so that's probably why. I'm sure

662
01:05:47.36 --> 01:05:52.40
back in the in fact your walk back in the day like 1940s well that's all kinds of weird

663
01:05:52.40 --> 01:06:02.64
plays. Yeah so morale you guys lost the other puttune team was hyped on the morale you

664
01:06:02.64 --> 01:06:09.12
morale was immediately crushed and then you were all embarrassed then you lost. So even even in football

665
01:06:09.12 --> 01:06:16.80
it can be morale can be um three quarters of the game. Yeah I think so. It says morale is the

666
01:06:16.80 --> 01:06:22.80
confident resolute willing and often self sacrificing and courageous attitude of a marine to

667
01:06:22.80 --> 01:06:29.12
accomplish the tasks expected by the squad. morale is based upon pride in the achievement and aims

668
01:06:29.12 --> 01:06:34.88
of the squad faith and you as a squad leader a sense of participation in the squad's work,

669
01:06:34.88 --> 01:06:40.80
devotion and loyalty to the other members of the squad confidence in the ultimate success of the squad.

670
01:06:40.80 --> 01:06:50.80
Whichever army goes into battle stronger in soul their enemies generally cannot withstand them

671
01:06:50.80 --> 01:06:58.08
that's the Greek warrior's xenophon more than 2000 years ago. morale tends to fluctuate

672
01:06:58.08 --> 01:07:05.04
even among the best Marines. It must be your constant concern because this is the foundation of

673
01:07:05.04 --> 01:07:12.000
discipline you must recognize the extreme importance morale has to the combat effectiveness of your squad.

674
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:19.12
Marine tents are a morale tends to fluctuate even amongst the best Marines that's something

675
01:07:19.12 --> 01:07:26.64
it's important to know. I'll tell you it's a fact it it fluctuates less. It can fluctuate but

676
01:07:26.64 --> 01:07:34.40
man you get some some motivated troopers it's hard even it's hard even bring them down a little bit

677
01:07:34.40 --> 01:07:40.48
there is in the game and they help everybody it's so helpful to have somebody kind of motivated in

678
01:07:40.48 --> 01:07:47.04
the game like somebody with high morale like we got this and it kind of takes someone who can

679
01:07:47.04 --> 01:07:53.92
deal with adversity right yeah so and I was thinking which by the way is a decision yeah I know

680
01:07:53.92 --> 01:07:58.88
and it's a great decision too yeah you can be like look I know what's happening right now I can

681
01:07:58.88 --> 01:08:05.60
see what's happening I can see the negativity start to drag down and you can say they will I'm

682
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:11.44
not letting this happen on me and you get crazy so but that guy who's getting crazy and you're

683
01:08:12.24 --> 01:08:17.04
he has to be kind of used to adversity one where another or at the very least know how to deal with it

684
01:08:17.04 --> 01:08:22.40
that sort of yes so so it kind of brought me back a little bit to the two conversation we had recently

685
01:08:22.40 --> 01:08:27.44
about guys quitting who you whatever maybe where you would think no way that's going to

686
01:08:27.44 --> 01:08:34.56
quit because he's he's a stud but this guy is probably not you get in you know in MMA and

687
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:40.80
you're somewhere whatever in Dick Marseynco's book recently died the rogue warrior

688
01:08:41.52 --> 01:08:49.52
he wrote a book came out 1992 when I was a new guy in the dirt but he called these people gazelles

689
01:08:49.52 --> 01:08:56.32
yes yeah and he said gazelles they they're used to winning they're run they run they win and

690
01:08:56.32 --> 01:08:59.44
they run they win and they're just good athletes and they're just winning winning winning

691
01:08:59.44 --> 01:09:05.12
and they show up of buds and I can promise you there's gonna be some shit you loose

692
01:09:05.92 --> 01:09:12.000
and if that's you get that adversity wall and you've been a stud your whole life and all the

693
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.04
sudden I'm sure there's multiple psychological things that can unfold one of them might be

694
01:09:19.04 --> 01:09:23.12
you're used to winning and now you lose and you get down there's something but also hey

695
01:09:23.12 --> 01:09:27.92
this is the hardest thing I've ever done it's harder than I thought it was going to be

696
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:32.000
or I failed this thing and now what's gonna happen if I failed this thing and I'm only two days

697
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.60
into this gig I got six more months of this and I already failed no I'm not cut out for this

698
01:09:39.60 --> 01:09:45.20
totally not used to it it's totally like an imposition on their whole sensibility and that's just

699
01:09:45.20 --> 01:09:50.32
how just not used to it but so you could in a way kind of track it back to morale really that

700
01:09:50.32 --> 01:09:56.000
way that that that individuals morale gets crushed exactly right like crap so you get a guy

701
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.32
who's used to adversity he's like hey this won't crush my morale I've been here before I know

702
01:10:00.32 --> 01:10:03.68
I can fight back out of this I know this is gonna end I know the you know guys who know

703
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:09.44
like adversity but the guy who doesn't the guy who wins every single time never failed ever

704
01:10:09.44 --> 01:10:14.48
in his thing you know just and just things come natural to him oh bro you like like I get crushed one

705
01:10:14.48 --> 01:10:20.56
time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that might be this the situation on the one

706
01:10:20.56 --> 01:10:25.52
Kobe so morale is kind of because in the beginning you'd think morale that's just you have

707
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:31.52
an abad attitude about stuff your morale is low like if they oh hey the morale is bad you know

708
01:10:31.52 --> 01:10:38.08
I don't have you you kind of on the surface it kind of comes off is that like Brad just I don't

709
01:10:38.08 --> 01:10:43.36
know fire yourself up like basically like make a decision to have a better attitude when you think

710
01:10:43.36 --> 01:10:49.36
about this the the buds when I was going through buds they would say false motivation is better than

711
01:10:49.36 --> 01:10:55.36
no motivation yeah I got to agree with it yeah you know yeah you know like you hear someone

712
01:10:55.36 --> 01:10:59.52
start getting fired up whether they're faking or not it's like hey that guy seems to be still

713
01:10:59.52 --> 01:11:05.04
let's go rock and roll yeah exactly right and that's it and you know like you guys will say like hey

714
01:11:05.04 --> 01:11:09.28
if you have like the the note bad team's only bad leaders right the bow cruise right where you get a

715
01:11:09.28 --> 01:11:13.28
guy who's coos like hey it's all good guys we're gonna do this and he's kind of

716
01:11:13.28 --> 01:11:20.24
motivating everybody even if they were kind of like beat down they're morale kind of gets

717
01:11:20.24 --> 01:11:26.64
gets more high on the academy online the other day I was talking about how you frame things up

718
01:11:26.64 --> 01:11:34.96
and this is a skill that you can attain over time but if you gave viewer my boss and you gave

719
01:11:34.96 --> 01:11:41.76
me the worst assignment ever by the time I'm telling the team I frame that thing up in a totally

720
01:11:41.76 --> 01:11:47.28
different way it is not the worst job it's a challenge it's an opportunity to look awesome

721
01:11:47.28 --> 01:11:52.80
we're gonna do better never it's like I'm gonna frame things up all day long in an uplifting

722
01:11:52.80 --> 01:12:01.04
morale moment yeah I'm definitely not framing something up as bad like we're gonna frame this up

723
01:12:01.68 --> 01:12:06.96
and the thing is it's not a lie it's the truth I can't you can't lie to your team you can't

724
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:12.80
lie to him and be like well hey everyone this is gonna be great we just hey everyone we we

weeks and then you get back and the boss says hey you're gonna do a dog and pony this weekend what

727
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:26.80
do you mean oh we got our congressman coming in and we got to show them our new capabilities

728
01:12:26.80 --> 01:12:34.64
and your cartoons doing it right you can't be like hey everyone this is definitely no but you

729
01:12:34.64 --> 01:12:42.88
can but you can frame it in a true way that's listen up hey the boss just talked to me they

730
01:12:42.88 --> 01:12:47.28
want the best platoon out here to represent and do this dog and pony we're gonna do we're gonna

731
01:12:47.28 --> 01:12:51.84

732
01:12:51.84 --> 01:12:57.28
stop walking through this stuff we're gonna get more money for the entire community by kicking ass

733
01:12:58.40 --> 01:13:01.68
you know what I'm saying it's a different day I'm fired up right now I'm ready to do a dog

734
01:13:01.68 --> 01:13:07.76
and pony show for a congressman yeah so you got a frame stuff correctly like your kids if they don't

735
01:13:07.76 --> 01:13:13.52
like math you can't be like no math is fun but you just like that's a lot in there for you there

736
01:13:13.52 --> 01:13:18.08
that's okay I can really relate to you at all I can't imagine my trust level is going down

737
01:13:18.72 --> 01:13:24.40
right like even a five-year-old knows that this is not fun right there's a rare person that

738
01:13:24.40 --> 01:13:30.32
thinks is fun but it's like one in a billion freaking Lex Friedman just got fired up look at

739
01:13:30.32 --> 01:13:37.20
a problem he's six years old he's like oh hell yeah right me not happening Lex good to go

740
01:13:37.20 --> 01:13:41.60
you need a better frame up on now yeah like Lex framed it up in his mind that's his good

741
01:13:41.60 --> 01:13:46.64
frame yeah yeah but yeah you know but when you say hey when you get good at this right here's

742
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:51.76
gonna make you smarter yeah this is you're gonna be able to dominate you're not got to worry about

743
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:55.60
school when you're dominant math you gotta learn this problem and people like I'm like

744
01:13:55.60 --> 01:14:04.56
I can dominate here do alright characteristics of morale major general William slim

745
01:14:05.36 --> 01:14:12.88
quoted by John Masters in the road pass the road pass mandalaia provides an example of how

746
01:14:12.88 --> 01:14:19.36
morale can be affected in combat can't some of these these things are really good quote

747
01:14:20.24 --> 01:14:24.16
we have already trained or meant to the highest possible level of skill with their weapons and in

748
01:14:24.16 --> 01:14:32.24
the use of minor tactics but in the end every important battle develops to a point where there is

749
01:14:32.24 --> 01:14:40.40
no real control by senior commanders every soldier feels himself to be alone discipline may have

750
01:14:40.40 --> 01:14:48.96
got him to the place where he is and discipline may hold him there for a time cooperation with other

751
01:14:48.96 --> 01:14:54.48
men in the same situation can help move him forward self preservation will make him defend himself to

752
01:14:54.48 --> 01:15:02.48
the death if there's no other way but what makes him go on alone determine to break the will of the

753
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:12.56
enemy opposite him is morale pride in himself as an independent thinking man who knows why he's there

754
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:19.44
and what he's doing absolute confidence that the best has been done for him and that his fate is

755
01:15:19.44 --> 01:15:27.84
now in his own hands the dominant feeling on the battlefield is loneliness gentlemen and morale

756
01:15:27.84 --> 01:15:35.76
only morale individual morale as a foundation under training and discipline will bring victory

757
01:15:35.76 --> 01:15:46.40
and that's see that's what's important what what I read this a couple times what's important here

758
01:15:46.40 --> 01:15:51.52
is to remember that as the leader you're the one that's developing their morale you're bringing

759
01:15:51.52 --> 01:15:57.68
together that unit you're training them to the utmost you're in your in part you're imparting this

760
01:15:57.68 --> 01:16:04.88
the benefits of self discipline you're rewarding those things and you build this creature this

761
01:16:04.88 --> 01:16:17.52
beast that has this morale that's so strong that they're not going down here's some specific

762
01:16:17.52 --> 01:16:24.88
indicators of morale response to shortages care of equipment and weapons rumors excessive

763
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:30.16
quarreling you brought that one up early with the football team personal hygiene standards of military

764
01:16:30.16 --> 01:16:37.76
courtesy personal parents personal conduct so like the the response sources how do they respond

765
01:16:37.76 --> 01:16:43.12
we hate we're almost out of water oh my god we're all going to die you know the movie aliens

766
01:16:43.12 --> 01:16:47.76
yes we're all going to die out here man right because there's a shortage of whatever

767
01:16:48.32 --> 01:16:53.92
we don't know if any backups coming you're all going to die that's bad morale it's a bad

768
01:16:53.92 --> 01:16:59.68
morale that's essentially the beginning of the end yeah so it's kind of like the end of the rope kind of a

769
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:05.68
thing of course you can turn it around but bro it's the beginning of the end oh no it's kind of a critical factor

770
01:17:06.56 --> 01:17:12.16
when there's when there it says this you're in the running when you're running low on whatever on on

771
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:16.72
equipment or food or water it says the squad with high morale and strong unicohesion will divide

772
01:17:16.72 --> 01:17:21.84
what is available and become an even stronger outfit because of it the unit does that does not have

773
01:17:21.84 --> 01:17:30.16
this quality is not acting cohesively as a team it will disintegrate quickly failure to properly

774
01:17:30.16 --> 01:17:34.72
maintain equipment and weapons and to get that a Marine does not care is becoming excessively

775
01:17:34.72 --> 01:17:41.12
fatigued or is lost all discipline on the other hand if you fail to provide the means to keep

776
01:17:41.12 --> 01:17:48.24
your Marines gear properly maintained you can rule them around you got rumors clearly there's a

777
01:17:48.24 --> 01:17:54.56
lack of information you you need to tell your team what's going on otherwise you're going to make it up

778
01:17:54.56 --> 01:18:03.04
and it's not going to be good cooperation mutual trust and confidence in one another's ability

779
01:18:03.04 --> 01:18:08.32
can be adversely affected when your Marines quarrel amongst themselves excessive corling is a

780
01:18:08.32 --> 01:18:13.20
sign that something is wrong and must be fixed I was going to say this is like a chicken or an egg thing

781
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:21.60
like when things start going bad people start to argue and when people start to argue things

782
01:18:21.60 --> 01:18:26.16
start going bad I guess it's a downward spiral I don't know which one starts first chicken to the egg

783
01:18:26.16 --> 01:18:30.64
but when you start hearing people arguing amongst themselves if you're going to have problems and it's not going to

784
01:18:30.64 --> 01:18:45.20
get better keeping it you know keeping it clean as far as hygiene goes says regardless of how

785
01:18:45.20 --> 01:18:49.84
miserable the circumstances may actually be we must do we can to make conditions habitable

786
01:18:51.20 --> 01:18:55.92
let's talk about this standards of military courtesy units that have pride in confidence in

787
01:18:55.92 --> 01:19:01.60
their leaders maintain high standards of military courtesy at all times changes show that poor

788
01:19:01.60 --> 01:19:11.28
discipline and lack of respect to may indicate loma Ra keeping it professional it's interesting

789
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:17.84
that they talk about standards of military courtesy but if you want to translate that to

790
01:19:17.84 --> 01:19:21.68
the civilian world you want to translate it to your family it's how you treat each other

791
01:19:21.68 --> 01:19:26.40
because sure the Marine Corps of salute means you know I respect you or calling you sure whatever

792
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:32.72
staying attention all those things but when you're a civilian if you want to

793
01:19:34.48 --> 01:19:40.48
keep your teams morale high even when things are going sideways you don't yell at your team

794
01:19:40.48 --> 01:19:44.40
you treat them with respect you ask them what their ideas are you know like that's what you do

795
01:19:44.40 --> 01:19:52.000
so treating people with respect is a way to maintain high morale it says this about personal

796
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.64
conduct moodiness solidness quiet withdrawal or any sudden unexplainable change in one of your

797
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:05.52
Marines behavior may indicate that something is wrong and there's cause for a concern that's a way

798
01:20:05.52 --> 01:20:12.32
you're acting now listen does that mean you want to be polyana and have a big smile on your face

799
01:20:12.32 --> 01:20:16.16
hey guys we're about to be overrun yay like no that's not what we're talking about hey I'm going

800
01:20:16.16 --> 01:20:24.80
to have to fire a bunch of people from our company no but going into that listen it's it's

801
01:20:24.80 --> 01:20:32.96
it's interesting that they say this solineness and quiet withdrawal and moodiness so none of those say

802
01:20:32.96 --> 01:20:38.96
be happy they don't say that none of them say jump for joy but if you're acting solin

803
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:47.44
if you're if you if you if you withdraw if you have an unexplain change in your behavior man

804
01:20:47.44 --> 01:20:52.48
being consistent is so important from a leadership perspective that's why you know it's getting

805
01:20:52.48 --> 01:20:58.16
interviewed a little while ago and they were asked asking me about resiliency and I kind of said that

806
01:21:00.16 --> 01:21:06.72
this was this was Travis minion sister Ryan and she was she was she's got a podcast about resiliency

807
01:21:06.72 --> 01:21:12.16
and I was on it and she was asking me about resiliency and I was like I don't think too much about it

808
01:21:13.36 --> 01:21:17.60
and I think it's kind of a little bit natural for me to be resilient and I shouldn't have said

809
01:21:17.60 --> 01:21:22.24
natural or maybe I didn't say it but that's the feeling I get but what I ultimately said was listen

810
01:21:22.88 --> 01:21:29.12
I feel like I'm fairly resilient cause I don't have low lows and the reason I don't have low lows

811
01:21:29.12 --> 01:21:34.48
cause I don't have high highs I'm not getting all excited but yay no I'm not doing that but I'm

812
01:21:34.48 --> 01:21:40.80
awesome like oh no I'm not doing anything one of those two things I'm staying in a limited emotional

813
01:21:40.80 --> 01:21:45.52
box we're not getting too crazy with a victory and I'm not getting too crazy with a defeat

814
01:21:46.88 --> 01:21:53.20
so I think that's this that lines up very well with this if you're if you're the person that

815
01:21:53.20 --> 01:21:58.88
shows how happy you are everybody's used to that and now when you start being sad they're going to

816
01:21:58.88 --> 01:22:04.80
all of geez echoes all bummed out something's wrong yeah or even not as happy like if you know

817
01:22:04.80 --> 01:22:09.52
these guys are super fired up and then you know something cool happens and they're like yeah

818
01:22:09.52 --> 01:22:13.76
right on and they're not as fired up you're like oh something's wrong even though they essentially

819
01:22:13.76 --> 01:22:22.56
express happiness just not enough he ever kind of back to the the professionalism and you know

820
01:22:22.56 --> 01:22:28.32
they're talking about in the military like okay so what is your wife call you normally

821
01:22:28.32 --> 01:22:33.92
darling darling not you buy your name huh not generally yeah I'm barely ever actually yeah

822
01:22:33.92 --> 01:22:38.40
my neither and I don't really call her by her name that much it's some other stuff we don't have

823
01:22:38.40 --> 01:22:44.88
to go into it but I don't want to hear the name sometimes if I call her by the name she'll be

824
01:22:44.88 --> 01:22:49.20
like don't call me by my name like kind of have joking you know because it kind of sounds but also what

825
01:22:49.20 --> 01:22:54.72
if what if she what if you were downstairs and she was like echo right exactly right or if

826
01:22:54.72 --> 01:22:59.28
we're going through some things or in some sort of almost like argument or whatever like yeah she won't

827
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:06.88
chill thankfully it's been multiple multiple multiple years it's sensing anything like that but

828
01:23:06.88 --> 01:23:11.44
even then let's say you're on bad terms with your wife and usually she calls you I don't know

829
01:23:11.44 --> 01:23:17.52
darling babe whatever they call you call each other and then they call you your name you kind of

830
01:23:17.52 --> 01:23:21.92
it's like a little assault on your scent like kind of like oh there's something wrong so when

831
01:23:21.92 --> 01:23:27.84
morale is down boom you can that part breaks down a little bit a little bit disrespectful yeah

832
01:23:27.84 --> 01:23:35.68
yeah so that's that's it that's why consistency and keeping yourself in check and making sure

833
01:23:35.68 --> 01:23:43.60
that you're not allowing these emotions to creep out and cause people to look at you and think

834
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:49.52
of echo is really concerned right now this is things are going bad echo is all but soul and right

835
01:23:49.52 --> 01:23:54.32
now things that's good what's going to spread yeah that's going to affect the morale of everybody

836
01:23:55.12 --> 01:24:01.52
what's with that with calling someone who you know good by their legitimate name

837
01:24:03.52 --> 01:24:07.20
that it's you know how like okay so in the family you know the old thing or if they call you

838
01:24:07.20 --> 01:24:11.60
like the parent calls the kid by their first and last name oh yeah you know that I mean they're

839
01:24:11.60 --> 01:24:16.96
in trouble like that kind of stuff yeah what is that I think it's because of what we're saying right now

840
01:24:16.96 --> 01:24:25.68
I think it's like a step up in in in lack of affection yeah it's like almost the opposite you know

841
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:29.60
in a small tiny way where it's like the better terms were on the more loose I'm going to be

842
01:24:29.60 --> 01:24:34.72
with what I call you'll call you more like fun stuff you know I'll call you by a nickname or a fun

843
01:24:34.72 --> 01:24:39.84
name or a pet name whatever you call it and then when things are bad okay now you're kind of

844
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:47.20
reduced to your legitimate name your official name okay let me ask you this tangental but

845
01:24:47.76 --> 01:24:53.20
if you ever hear people when they use your name a lot when they're talking to you yeah it's weird right

846
01:24:53.20 --> 01:24:58.56
it's weird it's weird it's like we're trying to establish a weird salesy type like thing where I know

847
01:24:58.56 --> 01:25:06.32
you you know echo like I don't think I've other than saying good evening echo I don't think

848
01:25:06.32 --> 01:25:10.32
you're ever that you're able to this podcast because that's a little weird right yeah I mean and

849
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:14.88
even when you do you see my first and my last name within which indicates like a small like it's

850
01:25:14.88 --> 01:25:20.72
like humor like a joke almost sure yeah exactly right but even you'll be like you echo

851
01:25:20.72 --> 01:25:26.08
trowels like it's a joke you know where I do say some names on this specific podcast is if someone

852
01:25:26.08 --> 01:25:30.72
else is here and we're having a three-way conversation I might say like well if I was to say to

853
01:25:30.72 --> 01:25:37.28
you hey Mike or I might say well that's right you know Fred because I want everyone that's listening

854
01:25:37.28 --> 01:25:41.60
to know that I was saying that to Fred yeah but that's different and what your tongue is different

855
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:48.48
it is I've always it seems a little bit strange it seems like something you would learn at like a

856
01:25:48.48 --> 01:25:55.68
like a a mastermind sales course to like touch them on the shoulder and tell say their name

857
01:25:55.68 --> 01:25:59.52
a bunch that I feel closer to you doesn't do that for me if you're trying to sell me something

858
01:25:59.52 --> 01:26:04.08
don't say my name because it's probably gonna like send me the other direction yeah it's not natural

859
01:26:04.08 --> 01:26:08.64
like it doesn't feel natural but some people that's just how that's just how they talk yeah but

860
01:26:08.64 --> 01:26:13.92
I think that's because they've been ingrained to do that I don't think it's normal yeah

861
01:26:14.48 --> 01:26:19.60
almost like it's like overly professional almost yeah that's the thing echo is when you're

862
01:26:19.60 --> 01:26:34.40
inside it's weird echo all right so I'm that I confirm that it is really if you listen to

863
01:26:34.40 --> 01:26:39.36
podcast you can hear people do that sometimes listen to podcast you hear someone saying

864
01:26:40.88 --> 01:26:46.32
you know it's like right it's kind of strange yes but she wanted to one there the only yeah yeah

865
01:26:46.32 --> 01:26:53.76
where the only was here echo it's more of your story up that joke in five attempts if you're

866
01:26:53.76 --> 01:26:58.08
scolding someone then it then it rolls up that's true like I bet you some of those scolding

867
01:26:58.08 --> 01:27:02.32
videos that we have of you and me I probably use your name more often than not I think I'll use your

868
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:08.32
name oh right because you're not scolding you just try to make fun okay I think on a knife I remember

869
01:27:08.32 --> 01:27:16.32
a appearances if a marine begins to look sloppy a behavioral problem may be the cause likewise

870
01:27:16.32 --> 01:27:20.40
if conditions prevent your marines from washing shaving or obtaining clean uniform for prolonged

871
01:27:20.40 --> 01:27:28.88
periods morale can drop this is one of those things where again in the business world

872
01:27:29.92 --> 01:27:36.000
some the hey here's our dress code hey we got a presentation you're going to get just a look sharp

873
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:43.20
smart move smart move hey and I can tell you I'm not one of these people that is going out

874
01:27:43.20 --> 01:27:50.24
in getting whatever whatever a tailor to make my suit or whatever in fact I don't really like wearing

875
01:27:50.24 --> 01:27:56.88
suits at all sometimes fighters wear suits have you noticed that why is that the box no no no

876
01:27:56.88 --> 01:28:02.16
I'm not sure I'm not gonna UFC yeah I know but it kind of it felt the feels like it came from the

877
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:09.68
old school of the box yeah I feel like I might be disconnected like and wrong or whatever you know

878
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:14.24
like I look at a box I look at a fighter and they're putting a suit and tie on to go to a press conference

879
01:28:14.24 --> 01:28:19.12
yeah I feel like in a million years I wouldn't have done that but I do think there's kind of

880
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:23.92
two camps on that and then there's a rare few that are kind of in between where some some guys

881
01:28:23.92 --> 01:28:29.36
they that's their jam they were suit because they're a conical sophisticated professional and

882
01:28:29.36 --> 01:28:35.04
that or that's the image and then there's guys like Nick Diaz who's you know just as good

883
01:28:35.04 --> 01:28:40.48
you're not better than everyone who probably never wear a suit so it's I think there's two camps

884
01:28:40.48 --> 01:28:45.44
sure definitely two camps I fall into Nate Diaz camp on that one this is just going to

885
01:28:45.44 --> 01:28:51.44
knit T-shirt to the press conference probably showing up late yeah yeah you could show them

886
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:57.44
yeah but you're like that in real life too though where you know you you probably gonna wear

887
01:28:57.44 --> 01:29:03.76
slippers or flip flops as we call them here and shorts and a shirt unless you have to wear

888
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:09.68
something else yeah that's true so watch out for that with your people that's what that's a kind

889
01:29:09.68 --> 01:29:13.52
of a classic thing too though right like even in the movies where it's like if they want to indicate

890
01:29:13.52 --> 01:29:18.48
visually that this guy has just let himself go his morale is down he's down and now what he's

891
01:29:18.48 --> 01:29:24.32
be on shaving yeah his clothes marimina be dirty like that kind you know type yeah

892
01:29:24.32 --> 01:29:30.40
uh characters six of motivation motivation answers the question why do marines fight motivation

893
01:29:30.40 --> 01:29:35.44
is based on a psychological factors such as knees desires and impulses that cause a person

894
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:43.68
act for a marine commitment and pride in the unit and the core is generally the basis for combat

895
01:29:43.68 --> 01:29:48.24
motivation I was when I was starting to read this chapter I was like thinking about the fact that

896
01:29:48.24 --> 01:29:53.52
I always say motivation no factor because motivation is a feeling it's fickle comes and goes

897
01:29:55.36 --> 01:29:58.96
and then I because thinking okay well how one of the how are they gonna talk about this

898
01:29:59.68 --> 01:30:05.04
and there you go and I've talked about this on the podcast motivation is why you're doing something

899
01:30:05.60 --> 01:30:09.68
and it's important to understand the why a motor video marine will do what needs to be done

900
01:30:09.68 --> 01:30:14.96
and will know the right thing to do with effective leadership and attentive concern for maintaining

901
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:19.84
high morale motivation will also be high however motivation is much more than just an indicator of

902
01:30:19.84 --> 01:30:25.28
morale is a key element that must be understood by everyone in your squad in combat motivation has

903
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:33.60
special significant to marines SEC Smith's US Marine Corps and World War II provides an illustration

904
01:30:33.60 --> 01:30:44.16
of this motivation quote in a foxhole in the center of the tenuous line he had done much to hold

905
01:30:44.16 --> 01:30:52.32
PFC John Errance an able company automatic rifleman lay quietly his eyes closed breathing slowly

906
01:30:54.24 --> 01:31:03.44
Errance was covered with blood he was dying next to him lady dead jasmine japanese sergeant

907
01:31:04.24 --> 01:31:07.44
and flung across his legs a dead japanese officer

908
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:14.80
Errance had been hit in the chest twice by bullets and blood weld slowly from three deep puncture wounds

909
01:31:14.80 --> 01:31:24.000
inflected by bayonets around his foxhole sprawled 13 crumpled japanese bodies

910
01:31:26.16 --> 01:31:32.64
as captain Louis W. Walt gathered Errance into his arms to carry him to the residency

911
01:31:32.64 --> 01:31:41.04
the dying man still clinging to his BAR said captain they tried to come over me last night

912
01:31:41.04 --> 01:31:49.12
but I don't think they made it they didn't Johnny Walt softly replied they didn't

913
01:31:52.32 --> 01:31:52.96
end quote

914
01:31:52.96 --> 01:32:02.72
on the echoes on the say what will motivate your marines to flight fight like pfc erans

915
01:32:03.92 --> 01:32:09.44
what causes them to have this measure of tenacity and the ability to continue to fight when others

916
01:32:09.44 --> 01:32:10.56
would give up

917
01:32:10.56 --> 01:32:23.84
numerous distortions sociologists and psychologists have studied behavior under fire and

918
01:32:23.84 --> 01:32:28.72
effort to under to find out why we fight as we do and explaining what motivates marines to

919
01:32:28.72 --> 01:32:33.44
per severe and battle many experts have concluded that the following facts are significant

920
01:32:33.44 --> 01:32:38.48
unique cohesion tradition commitment aggression patriots is in rewards and punishment social

921
01:32:38.48 --> 01:32:50.48
identity in the unique cohesion section it says cohesion is perhaps the most powerful

922
01:32:50.48 --> 01:32:55.20
motivational factoring combat common experiences and shared hardship stimulate and foster

923
01:32:55.20 --> 01:33:03.12
closeness among individuals as a unit the result in a unit that is able to maintain tactical

924
01:33:03.12 --> 01:33:08.24
cohesion and achieve success in combat if your marines know their mission it is their

925
01:33:08.24 --> 01:33:13.52
faith in you and their fellow marines that will carry them over the top charging into the teeth the

926
01:33:13.52 --> 01:33:15.52
enemy

927
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:20.96
this is a I'll get asked a lot about you know how do you bring a team together it's a

928
01:33:20.96 --> 01:33:25.28
kick out of do hard things together so it's one thing that's cool about the ftx program that we

929
01:33:25.28 --> 01:33:31.68
run it's it's challenging it is mentally challenging there's actually almost no physical challenge

930
01:33:31.68 --> 01:33:36.24
so that's not what I'm talking about it is mentally challenging and you will

931
01:33:36.24 --> 01:33:42.32
you will get put in situations where you have to make very tough decisions under pressure

932
01:33:42.96 --> 01:33:47.12
and when you get to do it yourself and you watch someone else do it and they do a call or bad

933
01:33:47.12 --> 01:33:54.32
call or good call it does definitely help out unique cohesion always thought or kind of

934
01:33:55.12 --> 01:34:01.52
came to the conclusion or whatever that uh we get close somebody has to do hard things like

935
01:34:01.52 --> 01:34:07.52
basically you have to go through the whole spectrum of things right hard easy good and that and

936
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:13.84
you go through all that together and still emerge without breaking up or not being friends or whatever

937
01:34:13.84 --> 01:34:18.72
so a lot of times if you're forced in a situation with this uh what you call on the interest is

938
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:24.80
the same for everybody like a line in drifter or a common interest and coming go they're kind of

939
01:34:24.80 --> 01:34:29.44
forced to be in the environment so they go through the hard times the fun times they go through the

940
01:34:29.44 --> 01:34:34.16
whole spectrum of things and a lot of times in the military and battle they go through the

941
01:34:34.16 --> 01:34:40.000
really really hard times and then which kind of you know on the flip side can precipitate really

942
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.52
really good times as well for if you know when you when you're triumphant with the guy with

943
01:34:44.24 --> 01:34:49.12
next you in hard times that's a really really good time so if you have that consistently

944
01:34:49.12 --> 01:34:53.36
boom that bond and same thing with like it's funny when you when you started talking about

945
01:34:53.36 --> 01:34:58.56
good times outside of echoes being stupid but then I thought about it it's like oh no that's

946
01:34:58.56 --> 01:35:06.32
important like just hard times cool you're gonna forge one part of unity but also like having fun

947
01:35:06.32 --> 01:35:11.20
and having good times is also a way that forms a certain part of the unity yeah I think that a

948
01:35:11.92 --> 01:35:16.16
a group that only has good times you don't get tested yes you gotta go through some hardship too

949
01:35:16.16 --> 01:35:19.52
yeah hundred percent and that's what it always felt like where you gotta go through the whole

950
01:35:19.52 --> 01:35:24.48
spectrum of ups and downs kind of together over over a period of time even if you don't go

951
01:35:24.48 --> 01:35:28.24
through it over a period of time if you get the whole spectrum you'll have a closeness that's

952
01:35:28.24 --> 01:35:34.000
kind of hard to replicate you know but if you do it consistently like for a long time yeah you

953
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.68
be that's why brother and sister a lot of time or like to brothers who grew up together like

954
01:35:39.68 --> 01:35:44.80
really close to whatever that's why it's like oh there's a different kind of relationship because

955
01:35:44.80 --> 01:35:49.04
it kind of like me and my brother were twins so we literally went through everything together

956
01:35:49.04 --> 01:35:55.44
literally so like the first time of that or whatever experience the first time was the first time

957
01:35:55.44 --> 01:36:00.64
for both of us you know so like the opposite time we wound up being really really close but that was

958
01:36:00.64 --> 01:36:06.08
kind of like that's where I had always feel like you know you I can go through an experience by myself

959
01:36:06.08 --> 01:36:13.04
and then a thought that's gonna be really close in my mind like it'll it won't be a lot of

960
01:36:13.04 --> 01:36:18.64
time we'll go by before I think oh I wonder what he would think about this or I know what he would

961
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:22.64
think about this you know or you know it like this boom you know like and you get those kind of

962
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:27.84
thoughts with the people that you super close with yeah the the heart of the combat the

963
01:36:27.84 --> 01:36:33.36
title of the bond because also to your point the heart of the combat the better the times are

964
01:36:33.36 --> 01:36:37.76
when you're not in combat anymore yeah and you kind of bro you kind of stretch out that spectrum right

965
01:36:37.76 --> 01:36:44.16
so it's like more it's deeper yeah check this is an important thing that we've covered on this podcast

966
01:36:44.16 --> 01:36:51.04
before was a quick quote for brave men who do not know each other well will not dare attack a lion

967
01:36:51.04 --> 01:36:56.64
for less brave but knowing each other well sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid

968
01:36:56.64 --> 01:37:04.32
will attack resolutely there is there is the science of organizations of army of armies in a nutshell

969
01:37:05.76 --> 01:37:12.88
and that's from battle studies by ardent the peak who we covered on this podcast battle studies

970
01:37:12.88 --> 01:37:18.16
but that's such an important thing remember he's like that's that's that's the science of building

971
01:37:18.16 --> 01:37:23.68
an army working together that's why at national and front we talk about building relationships

972
01:37:23.68 --> 01:37:27.28
because if we have a relationship with five relationship with three other people we'll take

973
01:37:27.28 --> 01:37:33.60
down a lion if I don't know these dudes we're not taking one on I'm not stepping forth it's not happening

974
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:40.08
you ever watch the movie speed speed speed speed speed and he's sending

975
01:37:40.08 --> 01:37:44.24
I was on a boss or something that I never watched it okay so really dumb so there's a part of

976
01:37:44.24 --> 01:37:49.52
at the end where they like kind of I don't know falling love for lack of a better way to put it

977
01:37:49.52 --> 01:37:52.88
and they even say can you edit that out for this podcast I want to talk about that

978
01:37:53.84 --> 01:37:54.88
what love

979
01:37:58.72 --> 01:38:06.08
anywhere they he they say uh I think they even mentioned earlier were you shouldn't get into

980
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:12.08
relationship based on extreme experiences oh because it's like whatever the reason and whatever

981
01:38:12.08 --> 01:38:16.000
but that goes with kind of what you think because when you go through these crazy experiences it

982
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.04
brings you closer together that's like the like like chas in the wedding singer when he starts

983
01:38:21.04 --> 01:38:26.40
going a few rules to pick up girls oh yeah that's that or no the wedding crashers what

984
01:38:26.40 --> 01:38:33.20
are what a crashers yeah he says uh grief is the nature's most powerful afrogate yeah

985
01:38:33.20 --> 01:38:44.56
he goes he's extreme situations the tradition marine values and attitudes are stressed from

986
01:38:44.56 --> 01:38:51.04
the day the first day the marine core and are constantly reinforced we are told over and over again

987
01:38:51.04 --> 01:38:54.16
the marine never quit some marine never surrenders and marine never retreats marine's never leave

988
01:38:54.16 --> 01:38:58.72
the dead wounded these are values become ingrained into the very being of every marine

989
01:38:58.72 --> 01:39:07.76
the last parallel core but martin rus u.s.m. see the average marine if such a condition exists

990
01:39:09.36 --> 01:39:15.36
is definitely not the lad represented on the recruiting poster more likely he is a small pimple

991
01:39:15.36 --> 01:39:22.48
faced young man who because it has been so skillfully pounded into him in boot camp believes he can

992
01:39:22.48 --> 01:39:32.32
lick the world commitment there's a quote in here about commitment men take a kind of hard

993
01:39:32.32 --> 01:39:37.52
pride in belonging to a famous outfit even when doing so exposes them to exceptional danger

994
01:39:38.24 --> 01:39:41.68
this is an essential element in the psychology of shock troops

995
01:39:44.88 --> 01:39:49.52
talks about aggression compassion for the enemy and non-compatence is a characteristic that

996
01:39:49.52 --> 01:39:55.44
is not uncommon among the marines in the battlefield however you must recognize that an aggressive

997
01:39:55.44 --> 01:40:00.56
fighting style is our trademark seek to maintain this determination and initiative as long as necessary

998
01:40:00.56 --> 01:40:05.12
to accomplish the mission and overcome the enemy understand that you will bolster the confidence

999
01:40:05.12 --> 01:40:09.76
of your marines by accomplishing the mission at the lowest possible cost in casualties

1000
01:40:12.96 --> 01:40:17.60
patriotism every marine must be convinced of the right rightness of their countries cause

1001
01:40:17.60 --> 01:40:22.72
rewards imponishment the purpose of our system of rewards and combat is intended to reflect

1002
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:27.28
the recognition of marines as warriors this recognition of heroic efforts and sacrifices on

1003
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:32.32
behalf of your fellow marines is an important leadership responsibility when it comes to combat

1004
01:40:32.96 --> 01:40:38.72
there's no amount of pay or any metal that can adequately award any marine for risking their

1005
01:40:38.72 --> 01:40:44.72
life to achieve a particular objective when marines who've experienced combat are questioned that

1006
01:40:44.72 --> 01:40:50.96
they tend to respond that their greatest fear was being perceived as less than adequate in the eyes

1007
01:40:50.96 --> 01:40:58.08
of their fellow marines their only reward was the respect praise and recognition which came from

1008
01:40:58.08 --> 01:41:09.12
within their unit that is no doubt the talk many times about what reputation means in the seal teams

1009
01:41:09.12 --> 01:41:15.76
and that's where you get that reputation how do you behave the in tough situations in combat

1010
01:41:15.76 --> 01:41:25.12
situations even in tough training situations social factors affecting marines primary group

1011
01:41:25.12 --> 01:41:29.84
which is their fire team squad or puttune are significant aspects of achieving combat motivation

1012
01:41:30.88 --> 01:41:35.28
marines will often identify with friends who are from their same home state or same geographic

1013
01:41:35.28 --> 01:41:46.08
area this helps build unique cohesion so getting the guys to work together this section

1014
01:41:46.88 --> 01:41:51.92
discipline a spree decor and proficiency are significant factors that you as a leader can

1015
01:41:51.92 --> 01:41:57.76
develop in your marines these along with morale and motivation will influence your success in combat

1016
01:41:57.76 --> 01:42:04.48
man when you're skilled at something and you practice and you train it just helps in every aspect

1017
01:42:04.48 --> 01:42:12.24
proficiency is so important and obviously discipline I said earlier that we're going to get into

1018
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:17.84
a little bit of this discipline is the willful obedience of orders discipline is exemplified by

1019
01:42:17.84 --> 01:42:22.24
situation where the individual has been taught to sacrifice their interest for the common good

1020
01:42:22.24 --> 01:42:28.000
and respond from a sense of duty which is more important than individual rights or wants now

1021
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:36.08
what you and I talk about a lot in here the common good this is you know discipline like

1022
01:42:36.08 --> 01:42:41.52
self discipline is when you're going to do something that's good not for you right now not the

1023
01:42:41.52 --> 01:42:50.000
donut not the sleeping in but what's good for the common good that takes discipline when the moment

1024
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.16
comes for a leader to send a marine in harm's way there's not room for discussion discipline

1025
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:59.44
ensures prompt the accomplishment of assigned missions and spawns initiative which guides your

1026
01:42:59.44 --> 01:43:06.96
marines actions in the absence of order morale and motivation provide the foundation for discipline

1027
01:43:06.96 --> 01:43:12.24
more than being a simple mechanism for maintaining order discipline is the essential condition

1028
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:17.68
within a unit that allows to overcome the extreme fear and fatigue of combat and this is why

1029
01:43:17.68 --> 01:43:24.08
this is the part that I wanted to get into the three types of discipline first off is self discipline

1030
01:43:24.08 --> 01:43:33.28
self discipline is the most important quality to develop in your marine self discipline means that

1031
01:43:33.28 --> 01:43:39.68
the individual has a sense of personal duty to their unit, fellow marines and nation this type of

1032
01:43:39.68 --> 01:43:45.76
discipline will hold your marines sturdy against anything the enemy may throw at them because they have

1033
01:43:45.76 --> 01:43:55.04
an firm inner conviction that they will not let their fellow marines down that's what we want that's

1034
01:43:55.04 --> 01:43:59.68
the most important quality to develop in marine is self discipline and then it goes to unit discipline

1035
01:43:59.68 --> 01:44:05.12
unit discipline is the behavior that results from the expectations of marines in your squad it arises

1036
01:44:05.12 --> 01:44:10.40
from a form of peer pressure where a marine knows that for an individual to belong one must

1037
01:44:10.40 --> 01:44:16.64
uphold the standard this quality of discipline will hold the marine steady while in the company of

1038
01:44:16.64 --> 01:44:22.56
other fellow marines and then it gets to this and this is why I wanted to cover this

1039
01:44:23.44 --> 01:44:29.60
imposed discipline imposed discipline is probably the most important part of this book

1040
01:44:30.40 --> 01:44:37.12
imposed discipline is behavior that is motivated primarily by your immediate supervision

1041
01:44:37.12 --> 01:44:45.60
do it because I said so it is a direct order to perform now you've heard me say this many times

1042
01:44:46.72 --> 01:44:50.96
we don't want imposed discipline and we definitely want to impose things on people but here's the

1043
01:44:50.96 --> 01:44:56.80
marine corps saying you know hey do it because I said so and then they continue this discipline

1044
01:44:56.80 --> 01:45:03.60
influences your marines to accomplish unpleasant or inconvenient tasks and then it says this under

1045
01:45:03.60 --> 01:45:12.96
extreme combat conditions you may be required to resort to imposed discipline says the words

1046
01:45:12.96 --> 01:45:20.32
required to resort to it this is not what we want to be doing and by the way it's under extreme

1047
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:28.56
combat conditions so if you're working in a finance company or you're working on a construction site

1048
01:45:28.56 --> 01:45:36.000
or you're working on a manufacturing line and you think as a leader you better use imposed

1049
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.32
discipline you're probably wrong and then it gives the example this was the only way that captain

1050
01:45:42.32 --> 01:45:47.76
barrel was able to force the necessary actions on the rigid career that we refer to in the unit study

1051
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:56.000
imposed discipline lacks the permanence of unit discipline and the special strength of self-discipline

1052
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:06.16
so imposed discipline is like a last resort in extreme situations your marines demonstrate

1053
01:46:06.16 --> 01:46:13.92
discipline through initiative self-reliance self-control and obedience the marine corps style of

1054
01:46:13.92 --> 01:46:19.52
warfare requires intelligent leaders with a pension for boldness and initiative down to the lowest

1055
01:46:19.52 --> 01:46:25.12
level it is the marines duty to take initiative as the situation depends demands I like the fact

1056
01:46:25.12 --> 01:46:31.36
that they start off by talking about initiative because that's what discipline you have to act or not

1057
01:46:31.36 --> 01:46:37.20
act but it's what you personally do it's your own personal initiative talks about self-reliance

1058
01:46:37.20 --> 01:46:45.28
talks about self-control obedience self-reliance and self-control pre-straitboard

1059
01:46:46.48 --> 01:46:51.68
obedience is when your marine respond without question when all of your marines respond to your

1060
01:46:51.68 --> 01:46:57.44
orders as a team a sense of unit is unit is created whereby everyone recognize that their role is to

1061
01:46:57.44 --> 01:47:03.84
contribute to something more important than one anyone individual and unorganized mob of marines is

1062
01:47:03.84 --> 01:47:09.84
useless in a crisis the strength to overcome the extreme crisis of combat is greatly affected by

1063
01:47:09.84 --> 01:47:16.08
your squad's ability to respond as a team a squad is capable of dealing with the chaos of combat

1064
01:47:16.08 --> 01:47:24.88
only in so far as the individual marines actions are part of the total squad effort

1065
01:47:25.12 --> 01:47:32.32
we obedience right this is this is I'm surprised they didn't go a little bit more into

1066
01:47:33.28 --> 01:47:42.56
you know these situations where you're in extreme scenarios because otherwise obedience is what is a

1067
01:47:42.56 --> 01:47:50.40
occurring not because you have given direction but because everyone knows what we're trying to

1068
01:47:50.40 --> 01:47:57.92
accomplish that that that's how a good unit should work a good unit should work we get into an

1069
01:47:57.92 --> 01:48:02.40
enemy contact and everyone knows what to do not because they're obeying but because they know what to

1070
01:48:02.40 --> 01:48:08.88
do they know why it's important when you're at a company and you've got to keep quality up on

1071
01:48:08.88 --> 01:48:16.08
your manufacturing line people are not going to do it because you told them to do it and they

1072
01:48:16.08 --> 01:48:21.36
are obedient that's why it's happening no they've got to understand that the quality of the product

1073
01:48:21.36 --> 01:48:27.20
is what supports the reputation of the companies which is why people are buying the product which is

1074
01:48:27.20 --> 01:48:31.36
why we get to make the product which is why the product is selling which is why I have a job

1075
01:48:32.08 --> 01:48:35.52
when they understand all those things you don't need to tell them what to do they're doing it they

1076
01:48:35.52 --> 01:48:40.96
get it so that's the kind of obedience that we want not obedience that's coming from an external

1077
01:48:40.96 --> 01:48:46.40
but obedience because we understand what the mission is I think that's an important

1078
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:50.64
facet there that didn't really come out in their explanation

1079
01:48:56.16 --> 01:49:02.48
got a little section on the spree to core the unit spirit and character the group

1080
01:49:02.48 --> 01:49:12.000
not the individual this is us working together some indicators expressions from marines

1081
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.52
that show enthusiasm and pride for the unit good unit reputation among other units strong competitive

1082
01:49:17.52 --> 01:49:22.96
spirit willingness to participate by the members in unit activities pride in the history

1083
01:49:22.96 --> 01:49:26.96
and traditions of the unit those are all good things here's some ways to improve this a spree to core

1084
01:49:26.96 --> 01:49:34.88
be the symbol of fighting spirit you want to develop start new people off-right by ensuring them

1085
01:49:34.88 --> 01:49:41.12
they're welcome into and reception by the unit train your marines as a team develop the feeling

1086
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:49.12
at the company as a team must succeed instruct them in history and traditions

1087
01:49:50.48 --> 01:49:56.56
this is something I explain a lot to companies you gotta explain what's happening where you've been

1088
01:49:56.56 --> 01:50:06.32
what you've achieved use appropriate proper ceremony slogans and symbols use competition wisely

1089
01:50:06.32 --> 01:50:13.92
to develop a team try to win in every competition use decorations and awards properly

1090
01:50:15.60 --> 01:50:20.16
it says this make your marines feel they are invincible that no power can defeat them and that

1091
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:26.40
the success of core and country depends on them and the victory of their unit now we got to be

1092
01:50:26.40 --> 01:50:32.24
careful because we got to watch out for arrogance right invincible's a strong word

1093
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:42.40
invincible is definitely a strong word proficiency this I mentioned this is so powerful because

1094
01:50:42.40 --> 01:50:47.68
I think it helps your confidence so much proficiency is advanced in knowledge and skill

1095
01:50:50.64 --> 01:50:56.24
the example they give here is once again from the book battle leadership by Captain Vaughn Shell

1096
01:50:56.24 --> 01:51:01.28
in peace we should do everything possible to prepare the minds of our soldiers to for the strain of

1097
01:51:01.28 --> 01:51:06.56
battle we must repeatedly warn them that war brings with its surprise and tremendously deep

1098
01:51:06.56 --> 01:51:10.88
impressions we must prepare them for the fact that each minute of battle brings with it a new

1099
01:51:10.88 --> 01:51:16.24
assault on nerves as soldiers of the future we should strive to realize that we will be faced in

1100
01:51:16.24 --> 01:51:24.000
war with many new and difficult impressions dangers that are thus foreseen and already half over

1101
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.52
come let's say that again dangers that are foreseen already half over come if you know what's

1102
01:51:31.52 --> 01:51:40.88
coming man you're already halfway there already half way there in preparing for combat of course

1103
01:51:42.16 --> 01:51:46.88
they go through a section what do you need to know friendly capabilities enemy capabilities

1104
01:51:46.88 --> 01:51:55.52
the face of combat and mental and physical fitness this is the straight sun soon right

1105
01:51:56.32 --> 01:52:02.000
know your enemy know yourself friendly capabilities this is not limited to knowing yourself

1106
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.72
and your job this includes knowing your Marines equipment and weapons know the techniques of combat

1107
01:52:07.84 --> 01:52:11.60
and the tactics that are used by a unit of your size you got to know the same thing about the

1108
01:52:11.60 --> 01:52:18.64
enemy enemies capabilities their weapons their troops their equipment the face of combat

1109
01:52:20.88 --> 01:52:24.32
says the goal of this course is to help you understand the battlefield environment although

1110
01:52:24.32 --> 01:52:28.80
that is not possible to realistically recreate the battlefield in training you and your

1111
01:52:28.80 --> 01:52:36.16
squadja learn as much as possible about the actual conditions of combat during training you know this is

1112
01:52:36.16 --> 01:52:41.04
something I wrote about this and can't remember if I wrote about it in leaders of strategy and tactics

1113
01:52:41.04 --> 01:52:47.60
or in the forward to about face but about how I knew when there was no war I knew there was like a gap

1114
01:52:47.60 --> 01:52:53.20
that I was missing I knew there was something I didn't understand you know the big the big

1115
01:52:53.20 --> 01:53:00.16
mesh there was some element and I just tried to read to try and understand it so I could figure out

1116
01:53:01.20 --> 01:53:10.64
what I was looking at what I was what I was in for building and maintaining morale and motivation

1117
01:53:10.64 --> 01:53:19.36
and combat belief in the mission is the source of morale and motivation that's why in extreme

1118
01:53:19.36 --> 01:53:26.72
ownership we wrote a chapter called belief you got to believe in what you're doing you got to

1119
01:53:26.72 --> 01:53:31.04
believe in what you're doing developing this belief not only involves developing your squad's

1120
01:53:31.04 --> 01:53:35.44
confidence that the job must and will be accomplished it also involves a deeper understanding that

1121
01:53:35.44 --> 01:53:44.40
their individual sacrifices and efforts are necessary and irrelevant what do you got to do

1122
01:53:44.40 --> 01:53:52.16
instill confidence leadership from the front is particularly effective your marines will always respond

1123
01:53:52.16 --> 01:53:57.60
when they see that you are willing to take the same risks as them make sure you're assigning people

1124
01:53:57.60 --> 01:54:05.60
to little right jobs make sure they get rest food quarters remember four hours and you know we

1125
01:54:05.60 --> 01:54:11.92
got to keep that going and it says here aside from providing food rest and quarters you must also

1126
01:54:11.92 --> 01:54:17.84
be concerned with attention to duty you must check to see that positions and weapons are properly

1127
01:54:17.84 --> 01:54:21.92
located equipment and weapons are maintained and that you attend to the numerous other details

1128
01:54:21.92 --> 01:54:28.80
that make effective combat unit this requires that you have discipline and develop a habit of training

1129
01:54:28.80 --> 01:54:40.80
and critiquing so that lessons learned do not have to be relearned maintaining morale and motivation

1130
01:54:40.80 --> 01:54:52.32
know your marines who's married who has kids how many siblings they have what special circumstances

1131
01:54:52.32 --> 01:54:59.68
are they under provide a break in routine this is kind of sort of attached to what I was saying earlier

1132
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:03.92
but I'll think this example when possible provide an opportunity for relaxation and recreation

1133
01:55:03.92 --> 01:55:12.40
at content in 1967 during a prolonged period under artillery enemy fire one unit held a tobacco

1134
01:55:12.40 --> 01:55:19.92
spitting contest judging accuracy and range everyone participated in some humor situations resulted

1135
01:55:20.80 --> 01:55:26.40
so that's a good one isn't tobacco have you ever seen tobacco there's like actual tobacco

1136
01:55:26.40 --> 01:55:32.32
competitions have you ever seen a five not what do you do spit yeah that that route what they just said

1137
01:55:32.32 --> 01:55:38.80
uh accuracy and range like they'd I remember that I remember this accuracy that there's like

1138
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:43.84
little techniques to do it though so one like there's a what he called split finger technique or like

1139
01:55:43.84 --> 01:55:50.56
you do see something it was weird he was awesome yeah it was kind of gross but I remember that being a thing

1140
01:55:51.92 --> 01:55:59.28
check there's a section here in it's this is again how to maintain morale motivation this is probably

1141
01:55:59.28 --> 01:56:07.52
one of the most important things include subordinates in the decision making process whenever possible

1142
01:56:07.52 --> 01:56:12.000
again life and I wrote about this you never have all the answers and some of your Marines may have

1143
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.76
good ideas listening to your Marines is not required to use their ideas but it will improve

1144
01:56:17.76 --> 01:56:23.12
their morale to know that you are willing to listen to them and by the way they're going to listen to you more

1145
01:56:23.12 --> 01:56:36.56
they're going to listen to you more maintaining discipline crucial elements health check the

1146
01:56:36.56 --> 01:56:41.36
physical condition of your Marines foot inspections changes in clothing hygiene enforcement

1147
01:56:41.76 --> 01:56:45.84
overall personal clemeness must be continuous proper care for caught splisters minor wounds

1148
01:56:45.84 --> 01:56:51.04
rashes and other conditions directly reflect a units level of discipline a units health discipline

1149
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:55.60
or lack of will affect its ability to fight man check on your people

1150
01:56:58.80 --> 01:57:07.76
make sure the weapons and gear is maintained appropriately make sure that people are staying in the

1151
01:57:07.76 --> 01:57:12.56
game make sure they're keeping their helmets on and they're they're weapon close at hand all that stuff

1152
01:57:15.60 --> 01:57:20.56
that's all important for discipline just like treating people with respect

1153
01:57:20.56 --> 01:57:26.88
maintaining that military courtesy rehashes on that combat may not require spit and pause but it does

1154
01:57:26.88 --> 01:57:33.52
not remove you from the obligation that you have toward your seniors disciplines what separates

1155
01:57:33.52 --> 01:57:44.08
your squad from a mob of armed civilians like that got to like that and building a spree to core

1156
01:57:44.08 --> 01:57:53.68
Marines are competitors whatever the event or sport they like to be challenged and they like to win

1157
01:57:54.80 --> 01:57:58.40
if you engage your Marines in competition against another unit your Marines will band together

1158
01:57:58.40 --> 01:58:02.96
to overcome the challenge which will build a spree to core that's so good to have competitions

1159
01:58:03.84 --> 01:58:08.72
whatever you're doing you got to sales team let's get some sales teams competing you got competition

1160
01:58:08.72 --> 01:58:14.56
on your manufacturing line let's you can have the most square-to-way workspace in the office let's

1161
01:58:14.56 --> 01:58:20.72
you can have the most square-to-way job site at the construction company and let's judge it

1162
01:58:21.52 --> 01:58:26.40
high standards come from teaching your Marines and then consistently correcting them it's a bit

1163
01:58:26.40 --> 01:58:32.80
strong when I read that like dude you don't want to be constantly correcting everyone I guess it's

1164
01:58:32.80 --> 01:58:38.64
as consistently consistently even that I'm gonna back off a little bit I'm gonna focus on what matters

1165
01:58:38.64 --> 01:58:43.20
but I'm gonna pay attention if there's some slack happening not gonna let it get out of control

1166
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:51.12
but don't don't spend a ton of leadership capital on that don't don't let that happen

1167
01:58:54.56 --> 01:58:59.04
foster team thinking as a leader your squad consists of three fire teams each with its own personality and

1168
01:58:59.04 --> 01:59:06.16
capability during putting their squad training have your fire teams compete against one another

1169
01:59:06.16 --> 01:59:12.48
let the losing fire teams do the winners clean up like those the kind of things good to go

1170
01:59:15.04 --> 01:59:22.80
talks about when you train train for the conditions of combat

1171
01:59:22.80 --> 01:59:31.36
this is something that's important is the way you do the way you train impacts everything that you do

1172
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:40.24
and and you'll mimic what you do in training with everything that you do so for instance we we

1173
01:59:40.24 --> 01:59:46.16
had rules when I was running trade at like as soon as we rolled out of the gate one of these

1174
01:59:46.16 --> 01:59:51.20
platoons rolled out of the gate it was a tactical mission and so there was no like oh hold on second

1175
01:59:51.20 --> 01:59:54.88
we you know we got a flat tire no it's like you've got a flat tire changing that thing it's

1176
01:59:54.88 --> 02:00:02.08
tactical you get some word to pass do it tactically there's a vehicle gets stuck hey hold on we

1177
02:00:02.08 --> 02:00:08.96
got none of no it's freaking tactical so that that's how you keep that and even like a

1178
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:14.40
resupply oh we need more water we just don't walk up to the freaking water buffalo and start

1179
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:19.12
filling our can't he's no you figure out a place to respite set up a respite when you say

1180
02:00:19.12 --> 02:00:26.72
it's tactical like what it's not like a non-challant scenario kind of thing like kind of like

1181
02:00:26.72 --> 02:00:31.44
it you stay disciplined with the way you stay disciplined okay stay this was all kinds of

1182
02:00:31.44 --> 02:00:39.60
opportunities when you're doing that type of training to just to just like okay well it's kind of

1183
02:00:39.60 --> 02:00:45.20
go admin I understand you matter fact we used to say that hey don't go admin right now yeah yeah

1184
02:00:45.20 --> 02:00:50.72
it's almost like you're pausing the actual training but you're saying no this is still part of

1185
02:00:50.72 --> 02:00:57.92
the training is still on and you know what the trade-out guys my guys influence that so if my

1186
02:00:57.92 --> 02:01:05.28
guys were coconut joking it would it would immediately not immediately in a lot of cases it would

1187
02:01:05.28 --> 02:01:10.72
transfer over to the pollton so if you got your if your trade-out guys are like shooting the shit

1188
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:18.24
because we're not part of the pollton that's supposed to be tactical it like spreads yeah yeah

1189
02:01:18.24 --> 02:01:26.88
yeah so we would all act like we would be tactical yeah there's so many fun right if I

1190
02:01:26.88 --> 02:01:32.48
little moment of memory because JP and I were out on FTX and in the FTX we do an excellent

1191
02:01:32.48 --> 02:01:38.64
front we use this high speed laser tag system which is really cool but in trade-out a lot of

1192
02:01:38.64 --> 02:01:44.24
time we use paintball or semi-unition which is shooting paint rounds and so one of the things that you

1193
02:01:44.24 --> 02:01:51.84
could do is an instructor is as a like let's say a pollton's walking down the street or they're walking

1194
02:01:51.84 --> 02:01:57.44
down a hallway and I was grading them or watching them I would go up and sort of like cover my

1195
02:01:57.44 --> 02:02:04.16
face and kind of crouch down as if I was about to get shot with paintballs you'd see like the

1196
02:02:04.16 --> 02:02:08.72
pollotunes we could so hype like you could see they're just instantly going to full alert mode

1197
02:02:09.44 --> 02:02:14.24
because they think they're about to get shot and yeah we'd have like I'd have like a little like

1198
02:02:14.24 --> 02:02:20.24
put my hand up over my face just to kind of hide from the impact of the semi-unition and you

1199
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:25.44
do that one like the training is not going on kind of a thing or when would you do that let's say

1200
02:02:25.44 --> 02:02:30.64
a pollton is walking down a hallway during a training and they of course there's a

1201
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:35.84
font in their mind like hey we we might get shot at right but when they see me it's covering up my face

1202
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:43.12
and covering up like my groin with my hand because I don't want to get shot or it's a CJP like

1203
02:02:43.12 --> 02:02:47.04
holding his face and putting his hand over his covers crotch because they didn't want to get shot

1204
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:51.92
when as soon as they see that out of the corner that I either like oh it's coming because you know

1205
02:02:51.92 --> 02:02:57.28
we're gonna trade at we know what's coming yeah you're the instructors yeah okay okay okay

1206
02:02:57.28 --> 02:03:02.80
there is actual like pranks on the internet I don't really condone the pranks but you can

1207
02:03:02.80 --> 02:03:07.52
watch them on YouTube where people will do that kind of stuff where just in public like the

1208
02:03:07.52 --> 02:03:15.52
people just in public like go like cover themself just like like something like that yeah and then

1209
02:03:15.52 --> 02:03:19.28
and watch the people reassuring exactly exactly the same way so it seems like an element of nature

1210
02:03:19.28 --> 02:03:24.000
there where it's a deaf course and then you it's not just an element of nature to trade at because

1211
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:32.000
you are probably about to get shot but that's important as a trainer that you maintain that

1212
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.92
high level professionalism and you can't be coconut jokin when you expect the platoons to be

1213
02:03:35.92 --> 02:03:40.48
tactical and you're sitting around like an idiot there's an example in here from

1214
02:03:42.32 --> 02:03:46.88
Chesty Pillar from the book Marine which we covered on the podcast bad news only increased the

1215
02:03:46.88 --> 02:03:53.20
tempo of polish training he cornered Colonel Pedro De Ball the great gunner who commanded the

1216
02:03:53.20 --> 02:03:57.44
11th Marines and he said Colonel you'll be starting artillery training next week I want you to

1217
02:03:57.44 --> 02:04:02.08
let me know when you'll fire I want to get my troops under it as often as I can every day

1218
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:06.40
afterward the men of one seven were in the field and the 11th Marines were firing shell

1219
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:13.04
streamed overhead until the wish of flying metal became as familiar as rifle fire there were many

1220
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:17.36
bursts nearby but no accidents pull it was the only battalion with such training he's just taking his

1221
02:04:17.36 --> 02:04:27.68
guys out get them conditioned to well to freaking bombs going over your head so good stuff and

1222
02:04:27.68 --> 02:04:34.000
the last little section here that just talks about fitness physical and mental fitness combat is

1223
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.68
physically grueling the demands made on your squad are going to be extreme and vary with the

1224
02:04:39.68 --> 02:04:43.92
environment in which you are operating routine physical training in camp ligerian or camp

1225
02:04:43.92 --> 02:04:48.40
ligerian is not going to prepare your Marines for the impressive heat and humidity of Ocanau

1226
02:04:48.40 --> 02:04:54.80
are the extreme cold for Norwegian winter demanding but creative combat oriented physical training

1227
02:04:54.80 --> 02:05:02.08
will serve as a better way of getting your squad into shape and then it says mental fitness

1228
02:05:02.08 --> 02:05:07.36
map exercises tactical exercises without troops and professional reading all help to prepare you

1229
02:05:07.36 --> 02:05:13.60
and your Marines for decision making in combat these forms of training are not exclusive to officers

1230
02:05:13.60 --> 02:05:19.28
and senior NGOs they're way of practicing war fighting intelligently without having to bring your

1231
02:05:19.28 --> 02:05:25.60
entire squad in the field and you do get better at decision making you do I would got to see

1232
02:05:25.60 --> 02:05:29.04
that all the time and trade it and I still get to see it with with leaders that we work with

1233
02:05:29.04 --> 02:05:33.44
the Dutch long front they get better at taking a step back to get better at detaching they could

1234
02:05:33.44 --> 02:05:43.44
better at analyzing things and they get better so that and also that mental and physical

1235
02:05:43.44 --> 02:05:50.24
fitness that we're talking about is not just for you as an individual for your teams that's what

1236
02:05:50.24 --> 02:05:56.16
it's for and if you're a leader you're responsible for your teams and that means whether you're working

1237
02:05:56.72 --> 02:06:01.36
in business whether you're working in the military whether you're a first responder or whether

1238
02:06:01.36 --> 02:06:06.80
you are a mom or a dad because you got a family and you're responsible for the physical and

1239
02:06:06.80 --> 02:06:16.88
mental fitness of your troops so there you go and I think this manual reinforces the fact

1240
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:22.40
that combat is like life and it's like life is just amplified and intensified because obviously

1241
02:06:22.40 --> 02:06:27.92
there's more intake but the lessons apply the discipline the mental and physical fitness

1242
02:06:29.60 --> 02:06:34.08
telling the truth so we're not getting rumors leading from the front confronting your fears

1243
02:06:34.08 --> 02:06:44.64
supporting other people having discipline not imposing discipline on your team asking your team

1244
02:06:44.64 --> 02:06:51.36
questions letting them come up with a plan all these things are in here universal lessons

1245
02:06:51.36 --> 02:06:57.20
for being a better combat leader and really universal lessons for being a better human being

1246
02:06:57.20 --> 02:07:04.000
speaking in which echoed girls were trying to be better human beings across the board just

1247
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:11.12
we're on the path on the program this way I don't like saying on the program that as much

1248
02:07:11.12 --> 02:07:15.36
because it indicates that like it's kind of this unique like you're on the program versus

1249
02:07:15.36 --> 02:07:19.04
your your off the program like you know like you don't necessarily have to be on the program

1250
02:07:19.04 --> 02:07:24.32
the whole time the path is just a way that's the way we're all in the path we're working out

1251
02:07:24.32 --> 02:07:31.36
reading we're listening listening more than we're talking hopefully we hope so yes we hope so

1252
02:07:31.36 --> 02:07:36.16
through that path you will need supplementation or it'll put it this way it'll benefit you a lot

1253
02:07:36.16 --> 02:07:41.92
you'll be you'll be that much better off on this path because it's not always easy trust me I know

1254
02:07:43.36 --> 02:07:48.08
so yes so let's start with energy drinks if you're into energy drinks got good news got

1255
02:07:48.08 --> 02:07:54.08
healthy energy drinks called discipline go by speaking of a unique that's a unique thing that's a way yeah

1256
02:07:54.08 --> 02:07:59.28
a healthy energy drink doesn't exist except right here there you go yeah true story there's other

1257
02:07:59.28 --> 02:08:05.68
people that like oh oh ours is healthy but we put 350 milligrams of caffeine into it yeah

1258
02:08:05.68 --> 02:08:09.04
it's not healthy you can't call that healthy can't put a label on it calls healthy

1259
02:08:09.04 --> 02:08:12.56
you can't put sugar in there and say it's healthy you can't put chemicals in there and call

1260
02:08:12.56 --> 02:08:19.20
healthy that doesn't work that's not the truth yeah so we have something legitimately healthy

1261
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:26.80
good to go you're certain you know discipline go boom many flavors eight of them if I'm not mistaken

1262
02:08:27.36 --> 02:08:32.88
I think man goes the best one seems to be uh seems to be what the robots like as well that's

1263
02:08:32.88 --> 02:08:38.16
you know many many entities like the mango it's a good one you know but hey choose for yourself

1264
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:42.80
but the good news is there's options one of the same far as flavors go again a healthy one there's

1265
02:08:42.80 --> 02:08:49.04
no real energy drink out there like it and you look you know an energy drink boom get the upside

1266
02:08:49.04 --> 02:08:53.44
yep also discipline go is also a pre workout there's a pre workout form okay for the last few

1267
02:08:53.44 --> 02:08:58.40
days drink coffee coffee am I addicted to coffee I don't think so how many cups a day

1268
02:08:59.20 --> 02:09:04.000
one every day two like two okay two every day maybe three but it's all at once like in the morning

1269
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.28
okay whatever yeah it's like a big coffee whatever I take almost every day but if I don't have

1270
02:09:09.28 --> 02:09:14.16
it I'm gonna head a turn of the like that so I don't know that I'm addicted to coffee okay so let's

1271
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:20.40
put that pre workout so for the past three days I have no coffee but I worked out first thing in the

1272
02:09:20.40 --> 02:09:25.84
morning I actually more than three days yeah more than three days um but I work out in the morning

1273
02:09:25.84 --> 02:09:30.56
so I'm not gonna drink a coffee then do the pre workout you know it's like it's kind of double

1274
02:09:30.56 --> 02:09:34.32
what it called double dipping unnecessary so you don't straight to the pre workout straight to the

1275
02:09:34.32 --> 02:09:40.56
pre workout one scoop and a half by the way okay I don't get the weird not here's the thing the

1276
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:44.96
jitter of the coffee and it's not really a jitter for me anymore it's more of just a little buzz kind

1277
02:09:44.96 --> 02:09:50.000
of a thing I don't you don't get that from the pre workout I don't even mind the jitter by the way

1278
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.16
that buzzer when I don't mind that but I didn't notice that you don't get it but I'll tell you

1279
02:09:54.16 --> 02:10:00.48
what you do get a kick ass workout so you don't even need the coffee you seem saying yeah

1280
02:10:00.48 --> 02:10:05.36
so anyway yes so you can use it as a pre workout again it's powder it's good taste just as

1281
02:10:05.36 --> 02:10:10.40
good makes it with whatever you want water whatever but very good this will help you on the path

1282
02:10:10.40 --> 02:10:16.000
when you're working out trust me you want to be that much more better off when you're on it trust

1283
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:23.44
me also got some protein this high quality protein is it right yes it is it is very very good

1284
02:10:23.44 --> 02:10:28.96
if I mean did anything to you if you want to choke down low quality protein that tastes kind of

1285
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:34.32
junk this is not the one for you but this one is good yeah you're gonna want that gratification

1286
02:10:34.32 --> 02:10:38.88
of just so you need something that tastes delicious you know the you've ever seen the meme

1287
02:10:38.88 --> 02:10:44.64
of whatever it is that it's like oh yeah you can eat whatever whatever and it's like oh that

1288
02:10:44.64 --> 02:10:50.88
face you make one now I want something sweet right there's a me and there's funny ways of

1289
02:10:50.88 --> 02:10:56.64
presenting it but it comes all different forms whatever but it always reminds me of that you know

1290
02:10:56.64 --> 02:11:02.96
it's essentially usually someone who's like let's say they over consume we'll say that and you know

1291
02:11:02.96 --> 02:11:07.04
I'm super full but now I want something sweet kind of a thing like that's a thing or whatever

1292
02:11:07.04 --> 02:11:12.88
well it seems to be a thing for me because I be drinking milk and after I have to have a straight

1293
02:11:12.88 --> 02:11:20.56
up to homo hawk steak I think that's why it's a thing I'd say more I would say

1294
02:11:20.56 --> 02:11:31.92
65% of the time when I get done eating something that is like steak I still want to have a

1295
02:11:31.92 --> 02:11:38.000
little bit of a little bit of a little more I'm getting on the milk train do you drink milk just

1296
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.32
in general like oh I'll just have a couple of milk or gossip milk it's gonna have milk and it

1297
02:11:42.32 --> 02:11:47.20
because why would I even that's like just the one of the dumbest things I've ever heard no but you

1298
02:11:47.20 --> 02:11:51.68
don't like okay so I'll tell you this if I was gonna if I was gonna let's say we had a little

1299
02:11:51.68 --> 02:11:59.20
scenario happening where I was gonna have a chocolate chip cookie then milk with no milk would be in

1300
02:11:59.20 --> 02:12:06.88
play but you know some people drink milk with dinner that's the norm I had a keto peanut butter

1301
02:12:06.88 --> 02:12:14.64
and chocolate cake the other day pretty amazing pretty amazing very shocking the amazing but I also

1302
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:19.92
had a little bit of milk milk regular milk because it was that was kind of the that was where I was

1303
02:12:19.92 --> 02:12:29.28
feeling yeah but the keto chocolate peanut butter cake credit was given true try to be what's the

1304
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:34.08
purpose of keto chocolate peanut butter cake because then you're not there's there's there's

1305
02:12:34.08 --> 02:12:39.36
two things look I could tell you that hey you know you want to stay in ketosis and all this stuff

1306
02:12:39.36 --> 02:12:46.72
I wasn't even in ketosis when I did the right but here's the thing when if you if right now

1307
02:12:46.72 --> 02:12:52.56
if you and I sat down and ate a piece of like whatever just giant chocolate cake filled with sugar

1308
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:56.88
I would feel like crap would you feel like crap maybe in two hours

1309
02:12:58.48 --> 02:13:04.16
I would feel I would feel like crap in like two hours a big I am whatever what's the word

1310
02:13:04.16 --> 02:13:09.60
the pharject the pharject if two hours maybe even like he isn't it probably doesn't even take an hour

1311
02:13:09.60 --> 02:13:15.76
immediately not immediately but you're like oh I just doused to my system with freaking sugar

1312
02:13:16.56 --> 02:13:26.48
and you feel like crap when you I when I had this and I've had several keto ish desserts right

1313
02:13:27.60 --> 02:13:32.80
and they're good and then you go if I still feel pretty freaking good you know okay

1314
02:13:32.80 --> 02:13:38.48
so that's why I just yeah I'd rather have that and I'm telling you there they're kind of like

1315
02:13:38.48 --> 02:13:42.72
milk you know you never milk like it's a milkshake you can have one of these and you're not like

1316
02:13:42.72 --> 02:13:49.84
I still really want a real peanut butter freaking chocolate cake or whatever you know yeah yeah

1317
02:13:51.68 --> 02:13:57.36
yes certain things don't pair well though with like chocolate cake or keto chocolate peanut butter

1318
02:13:57.36 --> 02:14:03.20
cake or whatever like it's too much chocolate like let's say milk didn't exist right you you eat a

1319
02:14:03.20 --> 02:14:09.12
chocolate chip cookie you know drink some white milk yeah you don't want chocolate milk no too much doesn't

1320
02:14:09.12 --> 02:14:14.16
pair well exactly right you don't pair any I've had a pair of stuff everyone's like but

1321
02:14:14.16 --> 02:14:18.000
here's the thing my pairing is kind of off when I eat chili you know like chili

1322
02:14:19.04 --> 02:14:24.48
chili and rice maybe some cornbread if we're lucky um I like milk with chili

1323
02:14:24.48 --> 02:14:29.52
is that that's weird right that's the jam seems like a good golf I think yeah

1324
02:14:29.52 --> 02:14:34.64
yeah for sure when I was a kid my mom would make spaghetti and I would just sit there

1325
02:14:34.64 --> 02:14:39.76
at the table like the rest of the family would be done it gone for an hour and I'd be saying

1326
02:14:39.76 --> 02:14:45.60
they're just eating spaghetti and I would have a gallon of milk and just pouring glasses of milk

1327
02:14:45.60 --> 02:14:52.32
because I don't okay so that's it yeah that's I'm framing your I don't know for 13141516

1328
02:14:52.32 --> 02:14:57.60
your stomach is literally a bonnambus pad then you can slow to eat enough so chill okay my

1329
02:14:57.60 --> 02:15:04.16
mom said I used to be like I sleep in the car when I was like 12 or 13 and just wake up

1330
02:15:04.16 --> 02:15:08.16
and be like can we get food right now and my mom said if I didn't you if we didn't get over to a

1331
02:15:08.16 --> 02:15:17.52
Mickey D's stat then I'd start getting angry well it I'm just saying fully and that is a thing

1332
02:15:17.52 --> 02:15:24.88
that's weird that and you I never thought about that specifically but I do remember where like okay

1333
02:15:24.88 --> 02:15:30.96
so I have this cousin Evan Evan Charles by the way um he'd be a and he'd be a and he'd be a and if

1334
02:15:30.96 --> 02:15:38.000
I was taken okay he'd be a and I forgot how to spell it nonetheless Evan he so he came to visit

1335
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.36
and we're the same age so he was but or he would maybe year old in us I forget so I think same age

1336
02:15:43.36 --> 02:15:48.48
and we were I remember because we're in like six or seventh grade but he was huge huge like tall dude

1337
02:15:48.48 --> 02:15:54.80
super tall and he would drink a whole half gallon of juice you know the calf can't concentrate the whole

1338
02:15:54.80 --> 02:16:01.60
thing he just drank it I was like bro like I can understand like that that juice is delicious and I

1339
02:16:01.60 --> 02:16:06.56
said but man I'm not like I'm not ready for that that's a lot of juice to drink just in one go like that

1340
02:16:06.56 --> 02:16:13.04
and that's a lot two years later I remember drinking a whole half gallon of juice because you were in the zone

1341
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:18.64
yeah well because I grew up you know I don't think I was even his size but I was like at that time I was like yeah

1342
02:16:18.64 --> 02:16:24.000
maybe 14 15 years old so drinking the whole thing and I remember thinking oh yeah Evan was pounding

1343
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.84
this juice the same way but I get it now bro when you're thirsty you just want to pound that juice

1344
02:16:29.04 --> 02:16:35.12
same same but yes I am thinking your stomach is kind of like a bottomless bit you eat the whole thing

1345
02:16:35.12 --> 02:16:41.28
a cereal whole thing like it's nothing chocolate is just pounding milk yeah whole for shit yeah like

1346
02:16:41.68 --> 02:16:46.56
nonetheless more milk but milk in and more whatever yeah and there's a good a lot of cool little

1347
02:16:46.56 --> 02:16:51.44
recipes you can add to the flavors if you want it's not necessary totally necessary but if you want

1348
02:16:51.44 --> 02:16:56.88
you can you can enhance that milk if you like also for your immunity and for things that you don't

1349
02:16:56.88 --> 02:17:02.40
want to worry about try workout try lift weights if you're into lifting weights which should be I

1350
02:17:02.40 --> 02:17:08.40
think you should be as doctors think you should be I from what I'm understanding more and more

1351
02:17:09.04 --> 02:17:14.64
resistance training in weights in my opinion the best form of resistance training is the

1352
02:17:14.64 --> 02:17:19.52
healthiest thing you can do for you barring like ailments you got heart thing situation is all

1353
02:17:19.52 --> 02:17:24.08
the stuff and of course cardiovascular has a lot of health benefits but for like immunity

1354
02:17:25.04 --> 02:17:30.80
balance of hormones cognitive like all these benefits resistance training yeah from what I understand

1355
02:17:30.80 --> 02:17:36.48
has proven to be lifting right we lift if you're lifting heavy and you're let's say you're
