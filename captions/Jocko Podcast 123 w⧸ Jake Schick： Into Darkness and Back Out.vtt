00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 123 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now this podcast is the third in a series of podcasts that I've done.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And if you haven't listened to podcasts number 121 and 122,

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
then go back and listen to those episodes before you listen to this one.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The first of those podcasts number 121 tells the story of Chester Poler,

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the iconic and heroic Marine Corps legend that fought in five wars.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What's awarded five Navy crosses, the most of any servicemen ever re-retired as a three-star general after rising through the ranks from private.

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Podcast 123 tells a much different story.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It tells the story of Chester Poler's son, Luis Poler, Jr.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
who also joined the Marine Corps.

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Who fought Vietnam, who was horrifically wounded and continued to fight against pain and against loss and against depression and addiction when he returned home from war.

12
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And in the end he lost that battle. After falling back into the downward spiral of alcohol and prescription pain killers,

13
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
he became another statistic of the most dreadful kind.

14
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He turned the gun on himself and took his own life.

15
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And as I said at the beginning of this series,

16
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I was seriously questioning whether or not I could do this podcast.

17
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If I had the wherewithal to gut through the pain of that story,

18
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and more important if it was the right thing to do if it was the right thing to bring this story to light.

19
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because clearly the story does not have a happy ending.

20
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I wondered if there was any good at all to be found in it.

21
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But I also know that darkness left unchecked and ignored

22
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:06.000
his darkness that grows. And if we do not learn from the past, then we know we are condemned to repeat it.

23
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There was one more compelling thing that allowed me to go forward in producing this series of podcasts about a year ago.

24
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I was in Texas and I was speaking at the Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit.

25
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Then I met someone there. He was a Marine.

26
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The uncle was a Marine. His grandfather was a Marine.

27
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And he had been severely wounded and I rack.

28
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And as I learned more about him, I came to understand the hell he had been through as much more than just physical.

29
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Like many veterans.

30
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The psychological wounds were also severe.

31
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But he had fought against the pain.

32
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
He fought against the loss.

33
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The fight that so many other veterans fight and he had come out the other side stronger and better and have dedicated his life to helping other veterans win that fight.

34
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
His name is Jacob Shek.

35
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And there's an honor to have him on the podcast with us here tonight.

36
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Jake.

37
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Welcome to the show, brother.

38
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Thanks for having me, bro.

39
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Thanks for coming on, man.

40
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You bet. I'm here to help.

41
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Well, I know you help a lot of people.

42
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I want to hopefully get you out there.

43
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Reach even more people.

44
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Thanks for that.

45
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
When I first met you, I was just talking to you.

46
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I don't know. I probably spent a couple hours at some random bar in a hotel somewhere in Texas.

47
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Yeah, over there at the stockyard.

48
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Yeah.

49
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Man, I told you then, I said, you got to come and get on my podcast.

50
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But when I was like I said, when I was reading these books, I was saying to myself, I got to have.

51
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I got to show the other side, man.

52
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm going to show that that you can get out of this. You get through it. And there's no better example that.

53
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Then, then you and the fight that you've been through.

54
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So let's get into it, man.

55
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Let's start. Let's start at the beginning.

56
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Let's start with young Jake.

57
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Oh, Lord, dude.

58
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I blocked up most much of the time.

59
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What were we talking about? Louisiana, bossier city.

60
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Is that how you say it?

61
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Back in the day.

62
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But now that was, that was until you were 12.

63
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah, eight.

64
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yeah, that was Bozier city.

65
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yeah, but you could depend on what part of Louisiana or from pronounce like that.

66
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The other way.

67
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The wrong way.

68
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
No, they're both right. And both sides of Louisiana will tell you that too.

69
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Nice.

70
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yeah.

71
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But yeah, I went to Texas when I was about 12.

72
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And moved in with my mom.

73
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So I went from like a structured discipline home to the intent.

74
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
This is of that.

75
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Which caught up to me pretty quick.

76
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Yeah.

77
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And so now your grandfather's ring was in the ring for?

78
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yeah, grandfather served war to fall on E.O.

79
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And it survived.

80
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And was, you know, obviously the driving factor with my interest

81
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
of being a Marine.

82
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And because I was really close to my grandmother growing up.

83
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And my grandfather passed away fairly long in the 50s.

84
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And there's a lot of questions about how he passed away.

85
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But we'll never know, right?

86
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I mean.

87
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So, but my grandmother would talk about my grandfather in her

88
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Trust was just swell with pride.

89
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
You know, I was at the baby of the family.

90
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And so when I would see that, I just thought to myself,

91
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
when she talks about me, I want her to do that same thing.

92
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So it looks like I need to be a Marine for that to happen.

93
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because every time she would talk about him, something from his

94
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
time the service in the Marines would be very close to that sentence.

95
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I knew, I want whatever that is.

96
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And at eight years old, I made my mind up that I'm getting that.

97
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
No matter what it takes, I'm going to get that.

98
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I mean, the only alternative was death.

99
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
That was the only thing that was going to stop me from getting it.

100
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And he and my grandmother and my uncle served in nom,

101
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and was the second generation Marine who's still very much alive.

102
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And he's pretty salty.

103
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And it was funny, man, because before I went to boot, I talked to him

104
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and he said, I don't know what to do.

105
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm about to go.

106
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
What do I need to know?

107
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And this is all he said.

108
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It said, be loud, be fast.

109
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Don't volunteer for anything.

110
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
That was it.

111
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So I'm on the phone and like waiting for the follow-up.

112
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah.

113
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I was like, okay, what that's it.

114
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
He loud, be fast.

115
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
No volunteer, everything.

116
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I got to go.

117
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And you know what's funny, man, is he's right.

118
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I told that to.

119
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
They're like, hey, what do I need to know?

120
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I bet you I've said that three dozen times.

121
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
To inferl a pair.

122
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It's almost a complete opposite of what with the Master Chief of Seal team one told me when I got there.

123
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And he said, keep your mouth shut, keep your ears open.

124
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Don't forget anything and don't be late.

125
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
That's what he told me.

126
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And you've, I volunteered for everything.

127
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I was dumb.

128
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But fired up.

129
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I was fired up kid.

130
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Yeah, well, not a lot of not much changed.

131
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000
No, it's, it's actually interesting because in the in the in polar juniors book, he's talking about us as they're in there in the basic school and they're getting ready to select for what they want to do.

132
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And they start getting graffiti on the desks and people are like,

133
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
uh,

134
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
motor T and out in three who gives the fuck driver truck and they're just being, they're like,

135
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
not all of them.

136
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
A lot of them started looking to work on him and you know what I don't want them to that.

137
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And very few of them were saying, hey, I want to be an infantry commander.

138
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And that's what a lot of them got, whether they wanted it or not.

139
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And then a lot of them got work, rather they wanted it or not.

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Yeah.

142
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Well, like I was just telling you, he was, he was OCS, the basic school 20 days leave in Vietnam as a two commander.

143
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Welcome to the court.

144
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Yeah.

145
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You know, just when you think the green wind he can't get any harder, you know,

146
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
it can't, there's no limit.

147
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I mean, it's just true.

148
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's like, with me, it was never, I never questioned, you know,

149
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I became a decent football player when I got the Texas, which was basically a

150
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
graduated high school.

151
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Not basically.

152
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
That's not a graduate high school.

153
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I was lucky enough to be just selected as a captain, my senior year and you know,

154
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I played for five eight takes football team, which was, this is the real deal in Texas, man.

155
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And it's not just under the NFL.

156
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Like in terms of intensity.

157
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You know, we had our team and get together and we'd be like,

158
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
we would like list out all the college teams.

159
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We were totally sure we could be just the young and stupid.

160
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Man, I mean, and it's just, it's crazy because you see the athleticism

161
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
difference between, especially when you go to your big schools and the NFL,

162
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
it's the speed, crazy.

163
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And the strength, I mean, all of it, the agility, it's night and day.

164
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It's night and day and it just goes to show you as young kids.

165
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You don't know shit.

166
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
You think you know a lot, you don't know shit.

167
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean, I was that way.

168
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And I mean, well, really, I still don't know shit.

169
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And I'll be 36 this month.

170
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And I mean, anyone who comes up to me and they're like, hey, I got it figured out.

171
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You know what I said?

173
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Perfect.

174
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
You know, long there need to be in my circle because I'll never learn anything from you.

175
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah.

176
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I know I'm going to die student life, but I mean, I was I loved football.

177
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
That was, that's what I thought high school was for.

178
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
You know.

179
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And so it was the old cliche thing.

180
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You know, it was, it was my small city.

181
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Um, where in Texas, where you top out?

182
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I got up at a COPB yellow.

183
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Look out was.

184
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And, you know, had it not been for the, for like my counselor in the principal and all those people,

185
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
like I wouldn't graduate it.

186
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Because I was pre-spent from the, the political crap by the time, you know, my senior year rolled around.

187
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And I just didn't know if I wanted it.

188
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I didn't know if I wanted it to do with it anymore.

189
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
You know, I didn't know if I wanted to play the game.

190
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It comes with playing the game.

191
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And it just got to where it was like, you know, this is, it's kind of bullshit.

192
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Because it's like growing up, right?

193
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Small town Louisiana where you go to church every Wednesday, every Sunday morning.

194
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And you put on your Sunday best and you go to church and you act a certain way or you're out in public and you act a certain way.

195
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You know, but you get home, the doors closed, that's all bullshit.

196
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I mean, in Ruby and condition is little kids.

197
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Like, hey, just, just fake it till you make it.

198
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And, you know, I'm alright saying that now.

199
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So you got, so when you were in high school, you kind of got tired of playing the game.

200
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You were just thinking, now, now, didn't you join the Marine Corps?

201
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah, but getting in my senior year is also already 18.

202
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I didn't tell anybody, because all those people I did.

203
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And I went over famously with my dad.

204
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Because my dad thought I was going to go play ball to small school.

205
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Because because I missed more days, my senior year than I actually went to.

206
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Because from football season was over, I was like, sweet, I'm done.

207
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Yeah.

208
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Like, that's it.

209
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I like, I don't need to do this school shit anymore.

210
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
That's overrated.

211
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But I knew it was not, you know, I mean, then they,

212
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Now, were you thinking, did you join, were you planning to go active duty, were you in the reserves?

213
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
No, so I'd signed up in my recruiter who I'll never forget is,

214
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It was a, he was legit, man.

215
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
You hear a lot of like horror stories about recruiters.

216
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I literally, I literally have a question here.

217
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's like, how is your recruiter?

218
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Because so many people have got recruiter stories.

219
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
One way or the other, that either screwed him or it's only took care of him.

220
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So my recruiter, first of all, he got me out of a lot of stuff where I was like,

221
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Dude, we're now days, there's no way.

222
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
It just wouldn't fly.

223
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Yeah.

224
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And I was like, how old did you do?

225
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Because if you don't worry about it, you'd just better be in the office.

226
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
So I tell you, be in the office.

227
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I might, bro, you can drive me if you want.

228
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But he, he, so they, you know,

229
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Most recruiting stations are like inside a shopping center or whatever.

230
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So they were right next to like a big grocery store chain and one day,

231
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
some, some dude goes and still some stuff.

232
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And, and he chases him down and like whips his ass in the parking lot.

233
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So he's a firefighter in the court, right?

234
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So, and I volunteered for infantry.

235
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I was like, I'm going to be on a big run.

236
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
He tried talking me out of it for months.

237
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah.

238
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
He's like, Jake, you really don't want to.

239
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I was like, no, that's what I want to do.

240
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yeah.

241
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And, but he chased the dude down and I was like, see,

242
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
that was for me, that was affirmation from God that I'm doing the right thing.

243
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
You know, these are my people.

244
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Yeah, that's just where I was supposed to be, you know.

245
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But it was, man, I, I, my second, I think it was a second week of football season.

246
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And I, I jacked up my right knee,

247
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and I'm seeing all my right knee and, and when I went inside the paperwork,

248
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I was on crutches and then in a brace.

249
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And I, I opened the door and like, hobbling and he goes,

250
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
what are you doing?

251
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And I said, I'm sure sign up and he goes, not like that.

252
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
You're not?

253
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
You know, I said, give me two weeks.

254
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We're playing whoever we're playing.

255
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I said, I'll be on the field, give me two weeks.

256
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I mean, it was like, there's no way.

257
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I said, okay, be here in two weeks.

258
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And he showed up and I played it hurt like hell.

259
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But I played through it, lied to my trainers, lied to the coaches.

260
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So, I'm good.

261
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I'm good.

262
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
You know, just a young dumb, like, you know, power before IQ, right?

263
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Just power through.

264
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
If you can just power through, you don't really need the IQ.

265
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And that's what you're going to be stupid.

266
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You got to be tough.

267
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
That's it.

268
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
That's it, man.

269
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And there's a lot of truth to that, which we can all access to that.

270
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Right?

271
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Every person.

272
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I don't care.

273
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I don't care.

274
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
If you have a pecker or not, you can access to that.

275
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
If you're going to be stupid, you better be tough.

276
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I'll be tough for sure.

277
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And so, we, but I ended up playing and I signed up.

278
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I didn't tell anybody, and then it was actually, I graduated by the grace of God.

279
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And because of high school football and taxes.

280
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And it was, it was amazing, man, because my dad actually met my recruiter at the high school graduation.

281
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And he was in his dress bluest, which is, you know, the best uniform there is.

282
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
No one can argue.

283
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And if you do, you just stay.

284
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yeah.

285
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
But he walks up and I said, hey, Dad, you know, I'd like you to meet my, my recruiter.

286
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
When he looked at me, my recruiter holds his hand out the shake.

287
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I said, man, my dad looked at me.

288
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And he said, you're dad, was this your dad finding out?

289
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yeah.

290
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Oh, dang.

291
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And he said, why would you do that?

292
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And then he looks at my recruiter, looks back at me, like waiting for me to answer.

293
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And I said, Dad, I would shake his hand.

294
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
You're your banker.

295
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I would shake his hand.

296
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Pretty sure you could take it.

297
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And he, he was pissed, man.

298
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
He was pissed because he's, and I didn't understand why at the time really.

299
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
You know, but later on, this is 2000, right?

300
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
This is pretty 2000.

301
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Yeah, 2001 actually.

302
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I was my graduation.

303
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So this is May, May, June, 2001.

304
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
So, yeah, this is pretty 90%.

305
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I'm already signed up.

306
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm in.

307
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I'm going.

308
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And he, so your dad's thoughts were more around, like, hey, you should go to college.

309
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
You should get a job.

310
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah.

311
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
You know, I'm a banker.

312
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
It's a good life.

313
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yeah.

314
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That type of thing.

315
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
You don't need to go and do this other stuff.

316
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Exactly.

317
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And so, and so my thing was,

318
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
There's no war going on, you know, at the time.

319
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.000
No, right.

320
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yeah, no.

321
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I mean, it was, it was, quote on quote piece time.

322
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yeah.

323
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And, uh, who's we all know, there's just something.

324
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
But whatever.

325
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
You know, whatever.

326
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Rainbows and roses and lollipop people want to have in their safety bubble.

327
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But we, you know, we.

328
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I knew that that was.

329
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
That's what I was destined to do.

330
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I knew it.

331
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Like I felt it as much as I know that, like, my legs and that were going to grow back.

332
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Like I knew that much that this is what I'm supposed to do.

333
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And I was helping on it.

334
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Helped it.

335
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And so, my dad was pissed.

336
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I was, I questioned it because maybe I didn't tell him, right?

337
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I got that from him and in a mirror, he had a thing.

338
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
He's right. I mean, it's never just one thing.

339
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Anything.

340
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It's never just one thing.

341
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Like I love people.

342
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Like, well, I know what the problem is.

343
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And like, well, what do you want to bet there's more than one?

344
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Because it's, it's just the way it is.

345
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But he, I didn't realize and I didn't think about, you know, at the time,

346
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I'm, I'm 19 at this point.

347
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And I didn't think about he had seen what war does to not only a person,

348
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
but someone that is his blood, his flesh and blood.

349
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
He's seen the after effects.

350
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
You know, he's, so he saw it with his dad and you won't.

351
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Was that his dad or his mom's dad?

352
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
That was my dad's dad.

353
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And his brother, his older brother.

354
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Yeah.

355
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And so he had seen the after effects and seeing, you know, my grandfather was a hard man.

356
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And, you know, the way that he, he was a man when it was okay to be a man.

357
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And you wouldn't get judged for being a man.

358
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Where is now that's a lot.

359
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I mean, don't act like you don't want to help talk about you.

360
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Because now it's like, but you can use you through bathroom.

361
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
That's okay.

362
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Oh, I guess.

363
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah.

364
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I mean, yeah, I'm looking at you with a blank stare because I'm like detached from all that,

365
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
like all that politic.

366
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I don't even, it's weird, man.

367
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
My life is weird that I don't, I just kind of revolve and revolve in my own little world.

368
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So when I, when I hear like, when I do, when that kind of stuff enters my world,

369
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm just kind of like, is that really happening?

370
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
It doesn't really compute and I move on.

371
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I don't know.

372
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Well, see, but when you're in my world, it's almost, you have to know.

373
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
It's not me, unfortunately, with what we're trying to do.

374
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Yeah.

375
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
It's, you know, it's a big ass mountain.

376
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
We're trying to move, man.

377
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And it's, but anyway, I go to, I go to boot and actually nine, eleven happens.

378
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Yeah.

379
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I'm in my room the night before.

380
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And the whole thing behind the reserves was,

381
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
so I thought about it and I was like, okay.

382
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So when you graduate may of 2001, you, you screw around for the summer being a Texas kid

383
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
that graduated from my school that's going in the Marine Corps.

384
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Oh, yeah.

385
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That was a real PG rated situation.

386
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Hundred percent.

387
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Then September 11th, that when's your boot camp when you leave in your boot camp?

388
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I leave for boot camp the month after 9, 11th.

389
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
So it's on.

390
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Yeah.

391
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
So it was nine, eleven happens.

392
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And so the way I looked at it was like, okay, you know what?

393
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
My grandfather was Corporal Schick, my uncle was Corporal Schick.

394
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I'm going to raise the bar for whoever the fourth generation is.

395
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I mean, because that's what we're supposed to do, right?

396
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
For those that come after us.

397
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And so I was like, okay, I'm going to join the reserves.

398
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Still infantry.

399
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I'm always going to stay infantry.

400
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I wanted to be a career infantryman.

401
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And then I'll pick up B5.

402
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
By that time, I'll already have my degree.

403
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And then I'll get my commission.

404
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Then I'll be a must thing.

405
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
So whoever the fourth generation is, like the bar set.

406
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Correct.

407
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Like that. So that was my mindset, right?

408
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Obviously, Johnny G. I had a different plan.

409
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But we, but nine, eleven happens.

410
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Yeah.

411
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And then it was, I mean, it became very real, very quick.

412
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Yeah.

413
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
That, oh, okay.

414
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Well, this is, I mean, I was going home about it.

415
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Yeah. But my, in my body, we wake up and my mother walks in my room and

416
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
like opens the door and beer cans like get pushed everywhere.

417
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So first she's like, what the hell is this?

418
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And then she's like, turn on the TV.

419
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
You were under attack.

420
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And I turned on the TV.

421
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I looked at my body and we went to the, we did the body system.

422
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And the court, and I looked at him and I was like, bro, we're going to war.

423
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Jack.

424
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And it was when it, you know, for a 19 year old kid,

425
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
you have that sense of, let's rock and roll.

426
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
But then the smart little little, little smart person that lives in the back of your head

427
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
was like, this may suck.

428
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Like this may suck bad.

429
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But it didn't, obviously, didn't deter my motivation in doing that.

430
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And so we, yeah, man, I left the month after 9, 11, which was, you know,

431
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I was right down the street from here.

432
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And I'm, see, R.D. San Diego, man, and I, let me tell you something.

433
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
As if Marie court, her own structure,

434
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
and he'd need more motivation to be Marie court, her own structure.

435
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
They had it.

436
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
September 11th, they were ready to get some.

437
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They had it.

438
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
It was gnarly.

439
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
But no matter, from the time that we landed,

440
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
and the time that we got on the bus,

441
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
which, this was something that always crack me up.

442
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Because you land, you can see the depot from the runway.

443
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But for whatever reason, the bus ride takes like an hour and a half.

444
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
You know?

445
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
That's welcome to the military in general.

446
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It didn't take long for me to completely understand why that is the way it is.

447
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
And so it was, but from the time, the first time I still on the elephant prince,

448
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
he's up till now.

449
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
But to this point right now, today, I wouldn't question, I don't question any of it.

450
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I don't, I wouldn't take any of it back.

451
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
I wouldn't trade any of it.

452
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I have no doubt that everything has happened exactly the way it's supposed to happen.

453
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I don't believe in coincidences.

454
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And I wouldn't take anything back.

455
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I mean, just because something that I've learned at the right old age

456
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
of soon to be 36 is that you can't have triomphe

457
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
without trials of tribulation and tragedy.

458
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Those are kissing cousins.

459
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
You know, you can't have one without the other.

460
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And where you go with it is up to you.

461
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And, you know, my life was one hell of a roller coaster ride.

462
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And it started the first time I still don't know the elephant prince.

463
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And it started way before that, man.

464
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Started, you know, I definitely had trauma before the trauma.

465
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I mean, I think majority of us do because we live in a very spoiled, first world society.

466
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And we forget that we're mere mortals.

467
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Just on the special about us.

468
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
We're all the same.

469
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
We were all just living, breathing, sexeskin.

470
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Jack.

471
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
You know, that's it.

472
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And so I, when I started boot, it was,

473
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
it was one of those deals where the mindset started of.

474
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And I already had some leadership skills.

475
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Thanks to football and team sports.

476
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And I had, I learned that growing up.

477
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And then in high school, I really got the home, those leadership skills.

478
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Which really helped me.

479
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And boot.

480
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I mean, I really believe in team athletics because it's, it's like everything.

481
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
No matter what you're dealing with,

482
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
the greater good is always going to be bigger than you.

483
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Always.

484
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And you have to hang on to that humility in that.

485
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I'm just, I'm just a dude.

486
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I'm just a dude.

487
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Being a dude.

488
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
But I'm just a dude playing a dude.

489
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Trying to be another dude.

490
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
But, you know what I'm, you know what I'm mean.

491
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It's, you, you, you realize often.

492
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
If you're really trying to do something that's worth doing,

493
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
you'll remind it often how human you are.

494
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Yeah.

495
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And, and, you know, I used to tell my guys if you're doing something for the right reasons,

496
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
you're going to win in the end.

497
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Like, and that means if you're doing something that's going to help the team win,

498
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
you're going to win in the end.

499
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
You're going to get what you want.

500
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
The things are going to go the way you want.

501
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
If you're doing something for yourself as reasons or for the wrong reasons,

502
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
you're going to lose in the end.

503
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Now, you might, both those, the person that's doing it for the right reasons,

504
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
might lose some battles along the way.

505
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
The person that's doing it for the wrong reasons might win some battles along the way.

506
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
But, the end game.

507
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Person, if you're doing the right things, the right reasons,

508
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
if you're looking out for the team, if you're doing it for the good of the team,

509
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
you're going to win.

510
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And if you're doing the opposite, eventually you're going to lose.

511
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
That's the way it works.

512
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
That's it.

513
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You're on the right.

514
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I mean, you know what the history books, they'll get right.

515
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
They do.

516
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
They'll get it out every time.

517
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Sometimes, sometimes, it takes years.

518
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Sometimes it takes 10 years.

519
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Takes decades.

520
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
But, the people that are doing the right things,

521
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
the right reasons they win.

522
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah.

523
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And I'd say, it's like, I tell guys all the time, which I still,

524
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
the humanality in me still has to, I have to remind.

525
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Every time I talk to a guy, when I say,

526
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
guy, I mean, man or woman doesn't matter.

527
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
But every time I talk to him, I usually start the conversation out with,

528
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
no matter what comes out of this hole underneath my nose,

529
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I need you to know I'm talking to myself too.

530
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Every time.

531
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Yeah, sure.

532
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And I say, it's, I say, you know, it's, it's none of our business.

533
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
What the hell other people think of us.

534
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
It is none of my business, what anyone else thinks of me.

535
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
It should have very little impact on any decision I make every day,

536
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
all day.

537
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
None.

538
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
It should have no impact.

539
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Yeah.

540
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Yeah.

541
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
There's an interesting dichotomy in that.

542
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And I've talked about that on this podcast before.

543
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Because for me, right?

544
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I'm a guy that on the one hand, I, I exact same thing.

545
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Like, I don't care what people think.

546
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
At the, at the other end of the spectrum,

547
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I absolutely care when I, whatever one of the things.

548
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And I'll draw you into this.

549
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
When you were doing something,

550
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I mean, when I was doing something in the SEAL teams,

551
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I'd be thinking always like, hey,

552
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
this is the right thing.

553
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
What's this going to do to my reputation?

554
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
What, what is, what is, you know,

555
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
my buddy going to think of me if I cut the corner here.

556
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
If I don't do the right thing.

557
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
So my reputation the way I was looked at,

558
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I did feel that pressure all the time.

559
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And at the same time, if someone was like,

560
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
oh, I don't like your clothes or whatever.

561
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I don't care at all.

562
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
But things that I cared about and from people that I cared about

563
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
and respected, I always had the attitude that like, yeah,

564
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
you know what?

565
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I do care what they think.

566
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
I do care what my, you know,

567
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I'll tell you what, man,

568
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
one of the hardest things I had to do when I, when I wrote a book.

569
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And like, here you are.

570
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You're going to write a book.

571
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
You know, you're going to write a book about yourself.

572
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

573
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
arrogant, conceited thing to do no matter what you say in the book.

574
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
It doesn't matter.

575
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
It's, you're writing a book about about you.

576
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And, and, you know, lay for wrote the book with me same thing.

577
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
The primary concern for me was like,

578
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
what are my bros in the teams going to think of me, right?

579
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
So, that's hard.

580
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Yeah, but there's, so there's a balance between those two.

581
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
All right.

582
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Let's, let me, let me simplify it.

583
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
The people that you're never going to meet.

584
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Yeah.

585
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
So, I, I, I'll, I'll barny style it for you.

586
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Sometimes you need to dump the things down for this guy over here.

587
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Everyone at this table, what should be honest,

588
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
you, you, you, the, the people you're never going to meet.

589
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.24
them meet, they will have little to no impact on your life and your well-being, hence

590
00:29:03.24 --> 00:29:07.60
forth. It doesn't matter. They think they matter and that's okay, let them think what they

591
00:29:07.60 --> 00:29:13.60
want to think. But it doesn't matter. Yeah, now that's 100% right for sure. Because it's

592
00:29:13.60 --> 00:29:19.88
real easy, especially in the line of work that we do, that we do day to day, it's

593
00:29:19.88 --> 00:29:26.42
going to kill. That it's real easy for people to sit on their self-loathing asses behind their

594
00:29:26.42 --> 00:29:32.68
computer screen and past judgment. When we continue to grind onward in the face of tremendous

595
00:29:32.68 --> 00:29:42.32
loss, there's something we said for that. Yeah. I mean, that's that that that right there

596
00:29:42.32 --> 00:29:48.12
is a test of willing character. All its own. And the face of tremendous loss to say, okay.

597
00:29:48.12 --> 00:29:55.84
We have to step back. We have to reassess. We'll read address and we'll re-engage. What's

598
00:29:55.84 --> 00:30:01.08
the dress or our left right now limits but, but there's still ground to take and demons

599
00:30:01.08 --> 00:30:07.96
to slay. We have to move forward and burn our pain as fuel. Because that's what we do.

600
00:30:07.96 --> 00:30:14.80
Because if not us who. And so that all that started when I was standing on those yellow

601
00:30:14.80 --> 00:30:22.08
footprints because you had this and it's something that you would. People that know

602
00:30:22.08 --> 00:30:26.04
their stuff about the military agrees with one thing that can be said about the Marine

603
00:30:26.04 --> 00:30:31.32
Corps. No other branch. Regardless of the vision at here's tradition as much as the

604
00:30:31.32 --> 00:30:37.04
Marines. I mean, you asked me about about Chastian. I'm like, yeah, I mean, we told him

605
00:30:37.04 --> 00:30:41.80
good night every night for three months. The Marine Corps is absolutely absolutely correct.

606
00:30:41.80 --> 00:30:45.40
Yeah, the Marine Corps does not play around when it comes to tradition. And I think that there's

607
00:30:45.40 --> 00:30:53.20
a. The proofs in the pudding, right? I mean, since 1775, we've shown that we adhere to that.

608
00:30:53.20 --> 00:31:00.96
That's what makes us who we are. And that's why it's, I think that we have the success

609
00:31:00.96 --> 00:31:05.76
rate that we have regardless of being the bachelor children of the military. Not really

610
00:31:05.76 --> 00:31:13.68
known where that is and being poor. It we make it work. We we have since day one,

611
00:31:13.68 --> 00:31:18.84
who've been able to really define what improvised adaption overcome means. We've been

612
00:31:18.84 --> 00:31:25.92
able to live that and prove situations where outside looking in, that's going to, it's

613
00:31:25.92 --> 00:31:32.52
a total loss and come out with a W. Come out with a victory because of that very

614
00:31:32.52 --> 00:31:38.32
tradition that makes us who we are. Because when all those fellows, all you have is your

615
00:31:38.32 --> 00:31:45.24
gut. Oh, yeah. Now, when you're going through boot camp, though, there was was there any combat

616
00:31:45.24 --> 00:31:51.96
veterans there? I don't know you had one. Yeah. That's that's the testament to what you're

617
00:31:51.96 --> 00:31:56.36
talking about, right? Yeah. Is that even though no one been in combat in, well, they're

618
00:31:56.36 --> 00:31:59.60
probably even if you guys went to go for maybe there's a couple of guys that went to

619
00:31:59.60 --> 00:32:04.60
Grenade or something or Panama, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. But those are like ones, these and

620
00:32:04.60 --> 00:32:11.60
two, these. Right. And there's a chance that like none of your DIs had any combat experience.

621
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:15.60
No, it's a great point. Yeah. And yet the lessons get passed on. You're head old, old

622
00:32:15.60 --> 00:32:21.60
Vietnam seal on here. And he was talking about when he came back from Vietnam. And he instituted

623
00:32:21.60 --> 00:32:27.60
this certain type of training at out in the desert. And I was like, I went through that training.

624
00:32:27.60 --> 00:32:32.60
And he's like, yeah, well, I put that together. Like the same, it's a point man course where

625
00:32:32.60 --> 00:32:35.60
they put we'd be trapped and they put targets to chew that. Yeah. That's stuff. I was like, yeah,

626
00:32:35.60 --> 00:32:39.60
he's like, yeah, I made that up. And I was like, oh, we still do it. We still do it. And so

627
00:32:39.60 --> 00:32:45.60
that tradition in the Marine Corps is like 200 years of things being passed down. Right.

628
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:50.60
Solid. Yeah. I mean, it's something that, I mean, listen, even now, it makes me

629
00:32:50.60 --> 00:32:54.60
swell Friday. You know, like I understand why my grandmother reacted to me. She did

630
00:32:54.60 --> 00:32:59.60
it truly now. You know, and I've been able to live that. I've been blessed enough

631
00:32:59.60 --> 00:33:07.60
to live this journey that, I mean, yeah, comes with a lot of pain and a lot of

632
00:33:07.60 --> 00:33:12.60
hard lessons. You know, I mean, pains and available suffering is optional.

633
00:33:12.60 --> 00:33:17.60
It's something I've learned to. You know, I mean, it's no one's going to be harder on you than

634
00:33:17.60 --> 00:33:21.60
you. Every day you wake up. You should just be thinking to yourself, alright, today

635
00:33:21.60 --> 00:33:27.60
it's me versus me. You know, and no one wakes up and goes, I'm going to go out of my way

636
00:33:27.60 --> 00:33:33.60
to be average today. Like if you wake up and do that, you need to have a gut

637
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:38.60
check. So, so you get, you get done with boot camp and then you go to

638
00:33:38.60 --> 00:33:44.60
Pendleton for for infantry. So I went up to Pendleton and, you know, it's was

639
00:33:44.60 --> 00:33:52.60
fun. You know, it sucks as in boot. I was first squat, squat, leader up until like a week before

640
00:33:52.60 --> 00:33:56.60
graduation. I think it's just because the senior general instructor didn't like me.

641
00:33:56.60 --> 00:34:01.60
I didn't like him either, though. So it was mutual. But, um, and there's one

642
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:05.60
D.I.I.I. that I swear if I saw him on a street today, like I'd go find him right now.

643
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:11.60
I'm not kidding at all. There was one dude that I got had PTSD as from that guy

644
00:34:11.60 --> 00:34:16.60
because he was going out of his way to try and mentally break me and it just never happened

645
00:34:16.60 --> 00:34:22.60
and what do you think, what do you, why was that? I think it was just it became this personal thing

646
00:34:22.60 --> 00:34:28.60
to him because he saw how other recruits would gravitate through he might have been like

647
00:34:28.60 --> 00:34:32.60
jealous of your, my downed bachelor, I don't know that at all. I don't make because he was

648
00:34:32.60 --> 00:34:38.60
ugly. He was not handsome like yourself. No, and obviously, I mean, money maker

649
00:34:38.60 --> 00:34:46.60
bro. But he was, um, but he was, you could tell the underneath at all, like he was,

650
00:34:46.60 --> 00:34:52.60
he was a great Marine. Yeah. Yeah. And he, you know, we lot a lot for that guy and

651
00:34:52.60 --> 00:34:57.60
for you other D.I.s. But, you know, it was just, I was thankful for our boot camp

652
00:34:57.60 --> 00:35:03.60
with the last name like Schick. You know, our guides last name was Schmitter.

653
00:35:03.60 --> 00:35:09.60
Yeah. That's nice. So for three months, hey, Schitter, we'll get your brother Schick.

654
00:35:09.60 --> 00:35:14.60
Three months, man. The only time I ever got emotional in boot camp was on the Parade deck

655
00:35:14.60 --> 00:35:21.60
on graduation day. When, um, handlers, one of the D.I.s. We had, he looked at me and he,

656
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:27.60
he said, I got to tell you Schick and I heard the, and I got emotional. I

657
00:35:27.60 --> 00:35:33.60
got emotional. I did. I got my name back. I heard it back. But, um, he told me what he told me.

658
00:35:33.60 --> 00:35:39.60
And then my dad was there actually in, and walks by me on the Parade deck and tosses me a

659
00:35:39.60 --> 00:35:42.60
can of Copenhagen, won't cut. Didn't even look at me and he said, good job. Let's go eat.

660
00:35:42.60 --> 00:35:45.60
Like keeps walking. So it's okay. Still pissed. Like, get it.

661
00:35:45.60 --> 00:35:50.60
Dang. Yeah. Oh, blooded. Yeah, dude. But it was, you know, like I said,

662
00:35:50.60 --> 00:35:55.60
there, there for years, I didn't get it. And then, you know, go up to S.O.I.

663
00:35:55.60 --> 00:36:00.60
to Pinnleton and, um, I loved every member of that too.

664
00:36:00.60 --> 00:36:04.60
Here's what made it awesome for me. And this is something that, a lot of,

665
00:36:04.60 --> 00:36:08.60
the listeners will relate to is that. No matter how

666
00:36:08.60 --> 00:36:10.60
normally it got in boot or how

667
00:36:10.60 --> 00:36:15.60
normally it got in S.O.I. or how tired or hungry or just beat down,

668
00:36:15.60 --> 00:36:21.60
you were mentally, physically, emotionally. There, all you had to do is look to

669
00:36:21.60 --> 00:36:27.60
your left or right because guess what? So are they. Yeah. But you go to fall down.

670
00:36:27.60 --> 00:36:32.60
They're right there to pick you up. No matter how tired you're, who doesn't

671
00:36:32.60 --> 00:36:38.60
want that? Yeah. No. You can't buy it. You can't buy, you have to pay for

672
00:36:38.60 --> 00:36:43.60
that with sweat blood and tears, period. And I learned also early on,

673
00:36:43.60 --> 00:36:47.60
you're going to find your great leaders by following the blood

674
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:52.60
and tomorrow. Literally and figuratively. It's not hard to find.

675
00:36:52.60 --> 00:36:56.60
Take off your first warm blinders, you'll find them. Follow the blood

676
00:36:56.60 --> 00:37:01.60
show, you'll find them. And I knew the ones that were and I knew the ones

677
00:37:01.60 --> 00:37:05.60
that were. And now, so does everyone else.

678
00:37:05.60 --> 00:37:10.60
It comes out in the wash, right? But we, you know, S.O.I. was awesome.

679
00:37:10.60 --> 00:37:14.60
I mean, I remember the first, the first weekend we had live

680
00:37:14.60 --> 00:37:19.60
in the first weekend. And what's the first thing that you think that they tell us

681
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:24.60
young stupid Marines? And, and, and, and, and so I Pendleton.

682
00:37:24.60 --> 00:37:27.60
Are you getting your first liberty? The one place not to go.

683
00:37:27.60 --> 00:37:32.60
TJ? The one place. I mean, where do you think like a

684
00:37:32.60 --> 00:37:35.60
van full of us go? Yeah. Yeah. Do you take a Marine Corps van?

685
00:37:35.60 --> 00:37:38.60
No, but we should. That would have been impressive. You should.

686
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:42.60
I can't, I still, to this day. You know, you left Friday

687
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:46.60
evening. I, to this day. I can't be there. Let me back in the United

688
00:37:46.60 --> 00:37:53.60
States. Like I was, I was thrilled. Hard. And at the time, my brother,

689
00:37:53.60 --> 00:37:56.60
I don't know if this is a draw for the time, where he was actually,

690
00:37:56.60 --> 00:38:00.60
she was for some reason here in, and so I count on and she was like,

691
00:38:00.60 --> 00:38:04.60
hey, come, you know, see me. And I saw her somewhere by the

692
00:38:04.60 --> 00:38:09.60
border or whatever. I'm sure I smelled amazing. Yeah. And like the look on

693
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:14.60
her face was like, how are you breathing right now? Because, you know,

694
00:38:14.60 --> 00:38:18.60
my idea was when they said turn to a liberty. Oh, yeah. Like that's exactly.

695
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:22.60
I was, I was seeking liberty. Yeah. No matter, and I wanted to find

696
00:38:22.60 --> 00:38:25.60
what liberty look like. I've told this story before. I was, we pulled

697
00:38:25.60 --> 00:38:27.60
into port one time. I was on a ship. It was in the seal

698
00:38:27.60 --> 00:38:29.60
between. We pulled into port. And what we used to do, there's

699
00:38:29.60 --> 00:38:33.60
be a line to get off the ship. Like check and liberty cars. So when the

700
00:38:33.60 --> 00:38:36.60
ship pulled into port, we'd work out that taking hour, then we

701
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:40.60
take a shower, and then the line would be gone. We go out. So we do that.

702
00:38:40.60 --> 00:38:44.60
We're, we've been in port for like an hour and 15 minutes. We go up to

703
00:38:44.60 --> 00:38:48.60
leave and they're carrying a Marine back on the ship. He's completely

704
00:38:48.60 --> 00:38:52.60
covered a few passed out drunk. He did that in like 48 minutes

705
00:38:52.60 --> 00:38:57.60
bro. That's impressive. That's getting after it. Just he

706
00:38:57.60 --> 00:39:03.60
would love those. Yeah. I listen. How do you not respect that?

707
00:39:03.60 --> 00:39:07.60
Yeah. I'm flouked. Because back in the day, I would have been like,

708
00:39:07.60 --> 00:39:13.60
I want to hang out with that here. But it's, I mean, that's just what,

709
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:17.60
you know, that's what we do. That's what that is. What that is is

710
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:22.60
18 year old human being that's been in boot camp, S. O. I. Hasn't,

711
00:39:22.60 --> 00:39:27.60
has it let loose at all? And has become a man by the way, or at

712
00:39:27.60 --> 00:39:31.60
least has been told in some way that he's become a man.

713
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:36.60
And that's where still has the boot stripe.

714
00:39:36.60 --> 00:39:39.60
You know, it's like, bro, you're not falling. You're right. Yeah.

715
00:39:39.60 --> 00:39:43.60
I get it though. I get it, man, because it's, you get there and it's like,

716
00:39:43.60 --> 00:39:47.60
okay, did boot did that. That was, you know,

717
00:39:47.60 --> 00:39:52.60
way more mental than physical. And it's, they're good at what they do.

718
00:39:52.60 --> 00:39:55.60
Yeah, for sure. They're good at what they do. I remember my grandmother

719
00:39:55.60 --> 00:40:00.60
telling me, just remember they have a job to do. They're doing their job.

720
00:40:00.60 --> 00:40:03.60
Now, one thing you go through is going to be personal. She was wrong.

721
00:40:03.60 --> 00:40:05.60
I don't know if we were with that one. Yeah.

722
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:08.60
Grandma was wrong on that guy. Yeah.

723
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:11.60
This is the same one. She's, she's a hard woman, man.

724
00:40:11.60 --> 00:40:16.60
She's, you know, she's, you always say, I suffer from what comes

725
00:40:16.60 --> 00:40:20.60
up comes out syndrome, because there is no filter.

726
00:40:20.60 --> 00:40:24.60
Yeah. I love that about her because it was,

727
00:40:24.60 --> 00:40:27.60
like, if she didn't like it, you knew. Yeah. And she would always say

728
00:40:27.60 --> 00:40:31.60
as far as I'm concerned, I have one grand baby talking about me right in front of

729
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:35.60
my siblings. Her given F tank was bone dry.

730
00:40:35.60 --> 00:40:39.60
Yeah, give none. This is the same woman.

731
00:40:39.60 --> 00:40:41.60
At first time, she sees me in the hospital and I'm all being

732
00:40:41.60 --> 00:40:45.60
up and she says, well, baby, I guess God didn't want you in the double

733
00:40:45.60 --> 00:40:49.60
one. Have you? And I was like, you know what? I'll take it,

734
00:40:49.60 --> 00:40:53.60
me, me. Yeah. I mean, I had an old war, two marine,

735
00:40:53.60 --> 00:40:57.60
a plant Vegas for some event or something, maybe I was,

736
00:40:57.60 --> 00:40:59.60
I had to speak out or whatever.

737
00:40:59.60 --> 00:41:05.60
And he said, just remember, I'm in bad br us by the Nobrew.

738
00:41:05.60 --> 00:41:07.60
I'm a religious dancer. Right on.

739
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:11.60
But, um, then it was, you know, boot was,

740
00:41:11.60 --> 00:41:15.60
was one of those things where you're part of the club, but not like,

741
00:41:15.60 --> 00:41:17.60
you know, you know, you're, when you're at S.O.I.

742
00:41:17.60 --> 00:41:21.60
how do they figure out what position you're going to be in a

743
00:41:21.60 --> 00:41:26.16
So, SOI, it's more of a number of things.

744
00:41:26.16 --> 00:41:29.04
I scored training as a O3 11 rifleman, right?

745
00:41:29.04 --> 00:41:31.84
And then, so I go through all the O3 11 rifleman training.

746
00:41:31.84 --> 00:41:38.88
And you get to, you get to finger most of weapons throughout the infantry.

747
00:41:38.88 --> 00:41:44.08
And then it was, I never understood the haunts, man.

748
00:41:45.04 --> 00:41:46.32
I never liked them.

749
00:41:46.32 --> 00:41:47.60
Always hated them.

750
00:41:47.60 --> 00:41:52.000
Because it was like, hey, let's go put on a stupid amount of weight.

751
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.96
Let's go warm up walking around motor T through your four times.

752
00:41:54.96 --> 00:41:58.80
And look at all the vehicles that we're never going to use.

753
00:41:58.80 --> 00:42:00.72
Like always feel like we're screwing the taxpayer.

754
00:42:00.72 --> 00:42:04.80
You know, actually, I can honestly say I have never, ever in my life,

755
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:07.44
done what you just said, which is warm up for a hump.

756
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:08.64
I've never done that.

757
00:42:08.64 --> 00:42:12.88
I was always just like, hey, I'll warm up for the first eight hours of this deal.

758
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:15.12
Yeah. Well, you know, so I'm going to clean your head.

759
00:42:15.12 --> 00:42:18.24
You're going to warm up walking around motor T. I like that.

760
00:42:18.24 --> 00:42:19.68
Take it into the next level.

761
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:22.72
It's just, you know, more mind games, Milton Bradley, bro.

762
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.16
But it was, it was the, the haunts that were like,

763
00:42:26.88 --> 00:42:33.04
I was just thinking of myself like, why don't we utilize all the stuff with motors in the motors?

764
00:42:33.04 --> 00:42:35.92
Like that you're walking around the motor train.

765
00:42:35.92 --> 00:42:38.40
So we're going to have the vehicles are that carry you.

766
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:39.60
That's the one.

767
00:42:39.60 --> 00:42:40.32
Not enough.

768
00:42:40.32 --> 00:42:41.20
Yeah.

769
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:43.20
But that was the, you know, that,

770
00:42:43.20 --> 00:42:46.16
you know, we finished S.O.I. and we did,

771
00:42:47.52 --> 00:42:49.28
you know, a lot of the training was, um,

772
00:42:50.96 --> 00:42:53.76
there were so many times where you would hear the guys,

773
00:42:54.56 --> 00:42:57.36
see, how we did this 10,000 times yesterday.

774
00:42:58.16 --> 00:43:00.48
And we're doing it another 10,000 times today.

775
00:43:01.12 --> 00:43:04.000
Because as you well know, we're all really good.

776
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.12
No matter the caliber of warrior and the amount of training you have,

777
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.84
we are all class A bitters.

778
00:43:10.48 --> 00:43:11.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:43:11.12 --> 00:43:14.24
100% you guys can play about everything.

780
00:43:14.24 --> 00:43:15.20
Everything.

781
00:43:15.20 --> 00:43:16.16
Everything.

782
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:18.80
You know, then we go off to these foreign places and these

783
00:43:18.80 --> 00:43:20.88
not only situations and we get home and we're like,

784
00:43:21.44 --> 00:43:22.88
I want to go back to that on this set.

785
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:26.80
I know why that is the way it is now.

786
00:43:26.80 --> 00:43:27.28
Yeah.

787
00:43:27.28 --> 00:43:28.08
I know now.

788
00:43:28.48 --> 00:43:31.92
That's just because it's crazy as it is.

789
00:43:31.92 --> 00:43:32.72
It's easier.

790
00:43:33.92 --> 00:43:35.68
Oh yeah, well, you got to have some fun with it.

791
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.68
Yeah, well, you come back here and it's like,

792
00:43:37.68 --> 00:43:42.88
like, it's just fricking Jerry Springer and the Kardashians.

793
00:43:42.88 --> 00:43:48.64
Like, just, and it's like, when can we just utilize an ounce of

794
00:43:48.64 --> 00:43:53.04
condescense, you know, just please for the love of God and all the

795
00:43:53.04 --> 00:43:53.44
totally.

796
00:43:55.12 --> 00:43:59.92
Could we just call a dog a dog and a cat and a man be a man and a

797
00:43:59.92 --> 00:44:03.92
woman be a woman and not worry about everything in between and

798
00:44:03.92 --> 00:44:06.80
all the judgment that's going to follow being what God made you.

799
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:14.56
I could we just focus on toughening up and teaching our children who will

800
00:44:14.56 --> 00:44:19.92
one day lead this country that believe it or not, the planet

801
00:44:19.92 --> 00:44:21.60
doesn't give a shit about your feelings.

802
00:44:22.96 --> 00:44:24.24
You're not always going to win.

803
00:44:25.12 --> 00:44:27.20
And mommy and daddy are not always going to be there

804
00:44:28.40 --> 00:44:31.28
deafening you with the rotor wash from their helicopter parenting.

805
00:44:33.60 --> 00:44:34.80
Like, that's going to go away.

806
00:44:34.80 --> 00:44:35.04
Yeah.

807
00:44:35.04 --> 00:44:36.000
Yeah.

808
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.80
Jack.

809
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:40.40
Because this world will punch you in the mouth and then laugh.

810
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.12
What do we teach our kids?

811
00:44:43.76 --> 00:44:49.92
One of my son knows because I tell him it is my job as your parent

812
00:44:50.88 --> 00:44:55.20
to make sure you were prepared to take said punch and punch back.

813
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:00.48
Because at some point it's going to happen and I would rather you lose

814
00:45:00.48 --> 00:45:05.92
whether you're in an MMA competition or baseball or whatever it is.

815
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:10.72
I would rather you lose doing everything properly at a hundred percent

816
00:45:11.52 --> 00:45:16.64
than when not doing the fundamentals of the way you're supposed to and going 50%.

817
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:21.44
And he looked at me like, well, dad, didn't know.

818
00:45:21.44 --> 00:45:23.36
Believe it or not, it's not always about winning.

819
00:45:23.36 --> 00:45:24.72
Because you're going to lose a lot.

820
00:45:25.60 --> 00:45:26.32
Yeah, it's life.

821
00:45:27.36 --> 00:45:27.68
Yeah.

822
00:45:27.68 --> 00:45:31.52
And I mean, it's it's something that's just start young.

823
00:45:31.52 --> 00:45:35.60
Start young letting them know that it's not all rainbows roses and lollipops.

824
00:45:36.16 --> 00:45:39.68
That there's no such thing as waking up on your unicorn ranch and picking what you're

825
00:45:39.68 --> 00:45:42.24
in a corner, you're going to ride on what rainbow to wherever you go.

826
00:45:43.76 --> 00:45:44.56
The dynamics is this.

827
00:45:45.28 --> 00:45:46.16
Can you do me favor?

828
00:45:47.20 --> 00:45:49.44
Can you just the last part about no unicorns?

829
00:45:49.44 --> 00:45:50.96
Can you not tell my daughter that?

830
00:45:50.96 --> 00:45:52.08
My eight-year-old daughter?

831
00:45:52.08 --> 00:45:54.64
Because she's like, yeah, she thinks that's his way to kind of.

832
00:45:55.28 --> 00:45:57.04
Just setting traps and it's going to happen.

833
00:45:57.04 --> 00:45:57.92
Imagine that.

834
00:45:57.92 --> 00:45:58.16
Yeah.

835
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.32
Hey, so you're done with that.

836
00:46:02.32 --> 00:46:03.52
So I, yeah.

837
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:04.48
Now, I'm now where do you go?

838
00:46:04.48 --> 00:46:06.64
Because you are you in the reserves at this point?

839
00:46:06.64 --> 00:46:08.40
Yeah, so I get done with that.

840
00:46:08.40 --> 00:46:12.000
So why and I go check in and I was late.

841
00:46:12.64 --> 00:46:13.84
No, that's good call.

842
00:46:13.84 --> 00:46:14.64
Checking in.

843
00:46:14.64 --> 00:46:15.44
Yeah, so I didn't.

844
00:46:16.40 --> 00:46:18.56
It was a communication breakdown, right?

845
00:46:18.56 --> 00:46:19.04
Sure.

846
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:20.24
So I didn't.

847
00:46:20.24 --> 00:46:21.52
What in my fault?

848
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:23.92
No, nothing's, you know, this proof just don't know, sir.

849
00:46:23.92 --> 00:46:27.92
But it was a situation that the guy checked in with was,

850
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:28.88
where were you checking in?

851
00:46:28.88 --> 00:46:30.48
What were you checking into?

852
00:46:30.48 --> 00:46:32.48
To my unit and it was in Basea.

853
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:33.28
Okay.

854
00:46:33.28 --> 00:46:34.32
Also known as Bosa.

855
00:46:34.32 --> 00:46:34.64
Okay.

856
00:46:34.64 --> 00:46:38.96
So I was supposed to check in with the do that I was in boot,

857
00:46:38.96 --> 00:46:40.48
or RSOI with.

858
00:46:40.48 --> 00:46:45.12
I can't remember what to boot together, not, but he goes and checks in.

859
00:46:45.12 --> 00:46:46.80
I thought Belie was a Friday.

860
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:49.68
And so he goes checks on Friday, the first order,

861
00:46:49.68 --> 00:46:52.16
and then he calls me as like Jake.

862
00:46:52.16 --> 00:46:55.20
First order, where the hell you are?

863
00:46:55.20 --> 00:47:01.28
I was like dude, I thought you're, he's like no bro.

864
00:47:01.28 --> 00:47:02.72
He won't see like now.

865
00:47:03.92 --> 00:47:06.32
So I'm there Monday morning first thing.

866
00:47:07.52 --> 00:47:08.80
And he looks at me and was like,

867
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:11.04
well, how are you, double-done?

868
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:15.52
I was like, sorry for shard,

869
00:47:15.52 --> 00:47:18.80
you know, so I didn't tell him it and he was like,

870
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:21.28
I see you keeper.

871
00:47:21.28 --> 00:47:24.88
I was like, there's no easy way out of this.

872
00:47:24.88 --> 00:47:26.72
You know, I look around his office,

873
00:47:26.72 --> 00:47:28.88
and all of his awards and the accolades.

874
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:32.48
And I'm just like, I just asked him like,

875
00:47:32.48 --> 00:47:36.08
do you, can we just go to the gym and you beat shard?

876
00:47:36.08 --> 00:47:37.92
You just get this over with.

877
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:40.08
And I saw things where,

878
00:47:40.08 --> 00:47:42.40
where when your dad asked you like,

879
00:47:42.40 --> 00:47:44.72
no, do you want to be grounded for a month?

880
00:47:44.72 --> 00:47:46.32
Or do you want the belt?

881
00:47:46.32 --> 00:47:49.44
10 times out of 10, I'm like, you know what,

882
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:50.64
you'll get the belt for you?

883
00:47:50.64 --> 00:47:53.20
Because that's easier, right?

884
00:47:53.20 --> 00:47:56.000
Let's just get through the temporary pain

885
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.08
and then move forward.

886
00:47:58.08 --> 00:47:59.76
And I was the same with first order,

887
00:47:59.76 --> 00:48:02.24
which I think in the beginning he liked, you know?

888
00:48:02.24 --> 00:48:04.24
It's a little, it may be beginning.

889
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:06.000
Yeah, yeah, because it was,

890
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.40
I developed a bit of repetition over time,

891
00:48:08.40 --> 00:48:12.08
but it was again, liberty, liberty.

892
00:48:12.88 --> 00:48:14.88
But he was a little that I know

893
00:48:14.88 --> 00:48:18.72
that I was checking in with now,

894
00:48:18.72 --> 00:48:21.36
sergeant major, the Marine Corps.

895
00:48:21.36 --> 00:48:22.08
Oh, damn.

896
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:25.36
And I didn't, I had, of course, you know,

897
00:48:25.36 --> 00:48:27.76
you can't put it in the future, shout out of that.

898
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:30.96
And so it was, but he was the one, one of the guys,

899
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:32.80
who was, he's just a Marineman.

900
00:48:32.80 --> 00:48:36.08
He's like, you know, it's like he fell off a poster,

901
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:40.08
and there he was, you know, like three red stripe,

902
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:44.72
make Matt black belt, and just, I mean, drill master,

903
00:48:44.72 --> 00:48:46.64
all of you name it, and he did it.

904
00:48:47.84 --> 00:48:52.88
And so he, we got pretty tight and, you know,

905
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:56.64
he displunged me when he had to, but it was,

906
00:48:56.64 --> 00:48:58.56
one of those things were at the time, my unit,

907
00:48:58.56 --> 00:49:00.88
when I checked in was actually in Gitmo.

908
00:49:01.76 --> 00:49:04.24
And they were doing base curdy and all that stuff.

909
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:07.84
And then they, he tells me, hey,

910
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:12.40
stay close to your phone, you're gonna go meet up

911
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:13.52
with your unit in Gitmo.

912
00:49:13.52 --> 00:49:14.64
Oh my god, I got a Roger that first time.

913
00:49:14.64 --> 00:49:15.48
I got to go.

914
00:49:15.48 --> 00:49:16.80
We, we in 2002, yeah.

915
00:49:16.80 --> 00:49:18.80
This is, yeah, so this is,

916
00:49:20.40 --> 00:49:22.08
ex-Ausem boot during

917
00:49:23.52 --> 00:49:26.16
Marine Corps birthday and Christmas.

918
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:31.52
Yeah, and so this was, there's flashback to being

919
00:49:32.08 --> 00:49:35.04
in boot camp for Marine Corps birthday and Christmas.

920
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:37.76
Marine Corps birthday, I don't know they still do it.

921
00:49:37.76 --> 00:49:38.56
I'm sure they do it.

922
00:49:38.56 --> 00:49:39.40
Oh yeah.

923
00:49:39.40 --> 00:49:41.92
But they give you stay contripped and like cake in the jowl.

924
00:49:41.92 --> 00:49:46.40
And so we got back to the barracks and that one dea was telling you about

925
00:49:47.52 --> 00:49:50.56
who likes pretty gut here's this, because he's, he'll know exactly what I am.

926
00:49:51.60 --> 00:49:52.72
Come find me, bro.

927
00:49:52.72 --> 00:49:57.84
And, uh, but we line up, we get online in the squad bay,

928
00:49:57.84 --> 00:50:00.88
and he makes us, we just finish this epic mill.

929
00:50:00.88 --> 00:50:04.72
We had more than like a minute and a half to eat.

930
00:50:04.72 --> 00:50:07.68
That's a sit there for a good five or six minutes,

931
00:50:08.72 --> 00:50:11.36
which is an eternity at the time.

932
00:50:11.36 --> 00:50:13.68
We get back online, start pounding canteens,

933
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:16.40
hold them up your overhead, run back to the head,

934
00:50:16.96 --> 00:50:19.68
refill them, get back online, pound the canteens,

935
00:50:20.88 --> 00:50:24.000
hold them over your head empty, do it again and again and again.

936
00:50:25.04 --> 00:50:30.72
And he said, we're doing this until every one of you pukes up that mill that you don't deserve.

937
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:37.20
Yeah, and so, and we did, and then the first, of course.

938
00:50:37.20 --> 00:50:41.04
Yeah, chain reaction, the first few weeks and then the starts.

939
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:45.36
Like with me, I would rather seriously be

940
00:50:47.84 --> 00:50:50.72
have like cruel and unusual punishment done to me than pukes.

941
00:50:51.76 --> 00:50:56.32
So I'm fighting it like, like a moe, like I'm fighting it hard.

942
00:50:56.32 --> 00:51:03.44
And then the company CO walks in the back door and it was hilarious because

943
00:51:03.44 --> 00:51:08.96
that said the eye like goes white like, oh, yeah, because he's hazing.

944
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:12.24
Yeah, and that's when daddy walks in and sees it,

945
00:51:12.88 --> 00:51:17.60
just walk by all of us and he's like he had to go back behind the racks

946
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:20.08
because he didn't want to get pukes.

947
00:51:20.80 --> 00:51:23.36
That's the guy's just puking on the deck right in the mill.

948
00:51:23.36 --> 00:51:27.28
Oh, yeah, that was all. Oh, yeah, because we were just going to deck to all it after the fact

949
00:51:27.28 --> 00:51:32.96
anyway. But then that was that was, that was I'm sorry.

950
00:51:33.68 --> 00:51:37.04
We're going to break the. Yeah. So then Chris rolls around, same DIY.

951
00:51:38.40 --> 00:51:44.24
And it's Chris was Eve. We do our lights out, nitro chesty wherever you are. He opens the door.

952
00:51:44.24 --> 00:51:46.40
We'll just say it was like Rudolph the Red Nostraine deer.

953
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:52.24
Everyone knows it's song, right? So he opens the door the duty hut and all you hear is

954
00:51:52.24 --> 00:51:55.28
Rudolph the Red. Bam, the door slam.

955
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.08
You just hear him go, that's all you get bitches.

956
00:51:59.76 --> 00:52:05.28
So you hear a lot of these one liners that I got, I stayed in trouble in the Marine Corps for laughing.

957
00:52:05.28 --> 00:52:08.88
When you're not supposed to lie, like, I have to laugh. It's coming. I can't hold it.

958
00:52:10.88 --> 00:52:15.52
I immediately lose it. But one of the guys who was already in the targets of the

959
00:52:15.52 --> 00:52:21.04
D.I started laughing and it was, I think he was gone like a Dan Affleyer. Like it was, yeah.

960
00:52:21.04 --> 00:52:25.28
But it's just some of these one liners, man. It's like you hear him. It's like where do the

961
00:52:25.28 --> 00:52:29.44
dudes come up with this? Yeah. But then you see him yelling at trees on the on the base and

962
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:35.28
they're like, oh, like they're graded on yelling at a tree. Yeah. Yeah. Who wakes up like I want to do that.

963
00:52:36.32 --> 00:52:41.76
One wouldn't me. But I checked in the dudes weren't getting me. And I stayed by my phone.

964
00:52:42.32 --> 00:52:47.28
Phone never rang. So I got, I was, I locked out. So what were you doing in the civilian?

965
00:52:47.28 --> 00:52:51.12
So were you living as a soldier? So I started doing drill one weekend a month or whatever. I started

966
00:52:51.12 --> 00:52:55.60
to go like, yeah, I mean, and I was training and getting ready because I knew we were going to go.

967
00:52:55.60 --> 00:52:59.92
I wreck our Afghanistan just didn't know what to want. You know, it was being in the line,

968
00:52:59.92 --> 00:53:06.24
you know, you knew you were going to go. And so it was the guys got home and we started training.

969
00:53:06.24 --> 00:53:14.80
And I'm in school, which went about like high school went and minus the football.

970
00:53:14.80 --> 00:53:26.56
And then they're on their student. So here it was funny because I realized early on, like I can do this.

971
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:35.44
I can do this school, though. The only downfall to that was, is it was like, okay, I've been after this

972
00:53:35.44 --> 00:53:41.28
for a year. I got my approved myself. I can do this. I don't need to see it through, but it's,

973
00:53:41.28 --> 00:53:49.36
now I'm just wasting my time. You know, there's a lot of beer to drink. And, you know, typical mindset,

974
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:57.52
but my unit gets home and I go and meet the guys, which is like every other, you show up to the

975
00:53:57.52 --> 00:54:03.20
first time. It's not going to do all the first time. Like you're immediately being sized up. And it's like,

976
00:54:04.16 --> 00:54:10.16
but I was one of those guys who, like, I was not, I just wasn't going to take a shit. And so it

977
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:19.20
went well for me because I was able to use dumb streets in humor to kind of get in with the,

978
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:25.28
with the guys who aren't me. And, but they also knew that I loved it. I loved what I did. And so the

979
00:54:25.28 --> 00:54:31.60
guys get back. And this one guy who's a freaking mortarman, go figure. And he's like, hey,

980
00:54:31.60 --> 00:54:35.44
shit, you're a big dude. You should be a gunner. You're going to be a gunner. What do you think about

981
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:40.32
being a gunner? Well, it doesn't matter. You're going to be a gunner. So it's like, all right, whatever,

982
00:54:40.32 --> 00:54:46.80
so I'm like 31. Okay, it'll be a gunner. And then we did our first pump with that system.

983
00:54:46.80 --> 00:54:52.16
Like that. And I was like, I'm going to beat that dude with an inch of his life because I knew

984
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:58.64
I could. And I was like, that son of a bitch should not tell me that it came with like a tripod

985
00:54:58.64 --> 00:55:06.000
and then it was like, oh, it's sucked. But it was, you know, I mean, earning a stripes, you know.

986
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.56
But it was one of those things where we were just waiting. But we were a tight unit. We were a tight

987
00:55:10.56 --> 00:55:17.84
night group. And I think I think that probably had a lot to do with us knowing that it's matter time.

988
00:55:17.84 --> 00:55:27.04
Right. Right. And most of us weren't prior combat guys. We were a young unit. And it was interesting,

989
00:55:27.04 --> 00:55:33.12
man, because it was, it was a, it was an eclectic group. And a group, a group from all walks of life,

990
00:55:33.84 --> 00:55:38.64
which is something that always really admired about the military regardless of what branch or

991
00:55:38.64 --> 00:55:45.92
special, whatever is that you are forced to communicate and to adapt with other people.

992
00:55:45.92 --> 00:55:52.88
Because if you don't, you're, you're screwed. Yeah. And that's something that I always appreciated.

993
00:55:52.88 --> 00:55:57.60
And at the same time, it wore me the hell out because there was some guy, you know, there's some guys

994
00:55:57.60 --> 00:56:02.32
that you're just like, you know, if I never saw that guy again, it'd be too soon.

995
00:56:03.52 --> 00:56:10.32
And it's usually just because, you know, it's, well, he's after explained to civilians that I'm

996
00:56:10.32 --> 00:56:14.08
working with because a lot of people have the impression of civilians that, you know,

997
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:17.20
the civilians have the impression that everyone in the military is just like a machine that

998
00:56:17.20 --> 00:56:20.56
just is going to do it their toll. And if you're the sergeant, the court is going to say,

999
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:24.64
this is even, it's like, hmm, not currently doesn't work like that. Like, it'll work like that for a

1000
00:56:24.64 --> 00:56:30.000
little while and work for, you know, little while, but over time, those, those, those young guys

1001
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.32
will, or the junior people, if you're not leading them correctly, you're not going to get things down.

1002
00:56:34.88 --> 00:56:40.56
Oh, you can turn and you should show real quick real quick, real quick because you're also

1003
00:56:40.56 --> 00:56:46.40
dealing with a bunch of dudes that feel like that, that are of the mindset, I can take on this

1004
00:56:46.40 --> 00:56:52.08
world of one hand tied behind my back by myself. You're dealing with that, you know, exactly what

1005
00:56:52.08 --> 00:56:58.32
I'm talking about, those, yeah, I'll for personality are abundant. Yeah, yeah. And then you, you mix in a

1006
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:02.40
lot of testosterone and stupidity and you have a very dangerous situation.

1007
00:57:03.76 --> 00:57:11.60
Low IQ high T count. We like it. That's basically what it is. It is, but um, now did you guys,

1008
00:57:11.60 --> 00:57:16.16
did you guys do like to, so you're doing one week in a month of drill and then you do

1009
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:22.88
two weeks in a summer time, but then in what 2003, you guys could call up a 2004.

1010
00:57:22.88 --> 00:57:27.60
I think we got, we got the call in 103. I believe if I'm not mistaken,

1011
00:57:28.32 --> 00:57:32.72
I've been blown up since then and hit in the head a lot. So I don't know, I think we got the call

1012
00:57:32.72 --> 00:57:38.72
in 103 saying that we were going to be called, the certain time and it gave you like a warning order,

1013
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:42.32
like, okay, it's common pretty much. And then they said, okay, you're going to go do your work

1014
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:50.64
up in 29 palms. So we, you know, we get to 29 palms and I was like, I remember, man,

1015
00:57:52.32 --> 00:57:59.04
getting off that burden, I was just like, this place sucks. I thought you were going to have

1016
00:57:59.04 --> 00:58:06.80
something really profound to say. No, and you said it to 29 palms, this place sucks. It was,

1017
00:58:06.80 --> 00:58:15.52
I was like, why? Why do, of course the Marines would have this base? Of course. It made total sense.

1018
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:23.44
You know, it was just like let the bitching begin. It was a bundle, bro. It was a bundle.

1019
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Because unless you had money to go to Palm Springs, I'll see it 29 stops. Right out the get some.

1020
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.96
And we are inevitably going to be fighting. This is the amazing thing. This is the amazing thing is

1021
00:58:34.96 --> 00:58:40.96
I got asked, I got asked on the podcast, you know, how do I, you know, my, I checked into a

1022
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:45.60
battalion or I think it got a company commander that Murau's not good. How do we get them real good?

1023
00:58:45.60 --> 00:58:50.24
Look, do hard things. You want to improve them, or I'll do hard things. And one of the things,

1024
00:58:50.24 --> 00:58:53.52
like, what are you going to do at 29 stumps? What are you going to do there? Well,

1025
00:58:53.52 --> 00:58:56.32
you're going to hang out with each other. That's what you're going to do. It's going to suck.

1026
00:58:56.32 --> 00:58:59.68
You're going to feel, you're going to sweat. It's going to be hot. And you're going to do hard things.

1027
00:58:59.68 --> 00:59:03.84
And you're going to become titers and unit. That's what happens. Yeah, imagine that. Yeah, imagine that.

1028
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:08.88
Weird. Weird. It's just weird how that works. Now, who is running the training?

1029
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.88
The ever training cadre out there? So we, uh,

1030
00:59:15.36 --> 00:59:22.48
remember it was, um, or you guys training yourselves or you're, is your officer leading the training

1031
00:59:22.48 --> 00:59:28.32
on the journey sergeant? Yeah, I mean, we had gunny, there was kind of both, right? We had

1032
00:59:28.32 --> 00:59:32.72
like we would go to Mount Town or wherever we would have some mountain structures out there and got it.

1033
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:39.68
But it wasn't because I mean, a lot of guys were forward to Floyd. Yeah. He were gone. And

1034
00:59:41.44 --> 00:59:49.52
but we, we literally, we trained, we trained hard. I mean, it was, you talk about

1035
00:59:50.48 --> 00:59:54.88
training for the sake of muscle memory. Yeah. We, it was, it was,

1036
00:59:54.88 --> 01:00:01.60
Narlie, what we did. And it was, uh, like you said, we did a lot of hard things through. And then we only

1037
01:00:01.60 --> 01:00:08.96
got tighter and tighter and tighter as a unit. And, but we, it was, uh, I mean, I remember the first time

1038
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:16.24
we went out to do our first training evolution out of American minds. And we, we humped out there

1039
01:00:16.24 --> 01:00:24.56
of course because you know, don't use the vehicles. And, uh, I remember we staged, we staged our gear.

1040
01:00:24.56 --> 01:00:29.92
And my Patoons are our drops of back. And there's like a, like a little rattle-synced in by

1041
01:00:29.92 --> 01:00:34.64
where you dropped this pack. And so we had to go move. And then he goes to put his back on to move.

1042
01:00:34.64 --> 01:00:40.48
And there's a black scorpion on his back. And I was like, this is awesome. Like this is,

1043
01:00:41.28 --> 01:00:47.44
and then we had a ton of bees that were go after the, the, the water buffalo,

1044
01:00:47.44 --> 01:00:53.12
the trailer, the bigger water trailers. And it was like, we can't, yeah. It's just,

1045
01:00:53.12 --> 01:01:01.04
yeah. It's an evitable Marine Corps shit. Like it's, the, the suck factor is going to be

1046
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:07.28
peg the entire time. Yeah. And it was, it's, it's like this guy was just looking down on this man.

1047
01:01:07.28 --> 01:01:14.32
Like, hey, you're going to earn it. Yeah. One day I'm going to have this team guy buddy on mine

1048
01:01:14.32 --> 01:01:19.60
on, he's got a lot of rattle snakes and worries from the desert because rattle snakes are very

1049
01:01:19.60 --> 01:01:24.000
amusing. You know, once you start catching them and putting on people's vehicles and putting them in

1050
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.36
there, they're backpacks. Sure. Just stuff like that. Like yeah. That's cool. I'm telling you right now.

1051
01:01:29.36 --> 01:01:35.36
That's good stuff for someone else. I'm not kidding. Yeah. No, it's, it's, you know, we have to see someone

1052
01:01:35.36 --> 01:01:40.000
jump though. Yeah. It does. But hey, you know, they don't know that the fangs have been removed.

1053
01:01:40.56 --> 01:01:43.84
Rip the fangs out. I want to let them in. That's me how much I care.

1054
01:01:43.84 --> 01:01:54.24
You can completely miss the point. It's the principal. Yeah. Snake season. Get some. Dude,

1055
01:01:54.24 --> 01:02:04.48
it was, some of the best. The dark greens did, did, do not like the, the little creatures in the

1056
01:02:04.48 --> 01:02:11.28
creepy crawallies. And seeing some of the reactions to some of the dark greens was, what's the dark

1057
01:02:11.28 --> 01:02:16.08
greens? They're, they're, to be politically correct. They're African American.

1058
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:22.000
Dark green greens. Got you. Com dark greens. And they know. And they, they're going to

1059
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.32
comp, so it's accepted. Right. It doesn't bother them. Do green. They don't write their

1060
01:02:26.32 --> 01:02:33.20
congressmen. It's, it's unbelievable the way that works. So that, there, it's, you know, I got to

1061
01:02:33.20 --> 01:02:40.88
see why I just spoke with this, uh, dill couple days ago. That was yesterday. And one of them

1062
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:46.24
rings, I served real zir, his dark green. And, uh, man, it was, it was, it was,

1063
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:51.36
prior to seeing him in a decade. It didn't miss a beat. It was, it was like,

1064
01:02:52.24 --> 01:02:58.000
seriously didn't miss a beat. And I'm like, man, that was, I just can't imagine. Imagine if

1065
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.84
mankind could have a taste to that. Just a taste. It would be, imagine how much better

1066
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:11.28
this spin and ball chaos would be. But it's, it was awesome. It was just good to see him and,

1067
01:03:12.24 --> 01:03:18.000
and to see the way that he changed. You just see the maturity over time, you know, of, of, of

1068
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.52
how life can, it, it authors your course and authors your mindset because of the things you experience

1069
01:03:25.52 --> 01:03:31.36
and you go through and, and the how many times you're taught how human you are, you know,

1070
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:36.72
it was, it was, it was cool. It was good for the soul, you know, and, uh, yeah, it was just cool to

1071
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.76
see him and be able to embrace that dude. I mean, I, that's my family. That is, I don't give

1072
01:03:41.76 --> 01:03:47.60
a shit what color his skin is. That dude's my blood. And that's just the way it is. It's way it always

1073
01:03:47.60 --> 01:03:55.76
will be. But we, um, and he used to, he used to know the shit out of me. Like I used to thought

1074
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:03.36
of saying like his, his mouth is never going to shut. Like one of these days, man, one of these days.

1075
01:04:04.40 --> 01:04:10.96
And, uh, but it was so epic because it was like, that's my bro, you know, and it was, it was just awesome.

1076
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:17.52
Man, it just goes to show you like, we get these little reminders in life. If, if you

1077
01:04:17.52 --> 01:04:23.60
just shut your mouth and listen, you get these little reminders of how worth it. Everything's been

1078
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:29.76
and what purpose everything is served. And it was cool to see that I got one of those.

1079
01:04:29.76 --> 01:04:37.04
You know, and it gives me, it was a little fuel for the soul to, to keep going. But, um, I remember

1080
01:04:37.04 --> 01:04:44.96
this, our, our first loss was in, uh, March Air Force Base, who we were doing house house fighting

1081
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:52.24
in the band in housing unit in March Air Force Base. And it was, um, it was a training loss because

1082
01:04:52.24 --> 01:05:00.80
of a guy that they were practicing J-turns and a Humvee. And, uh, there's a young kid, you, you

1083
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:07.84
wouldn't our company. He was a different company, um, same Italian. And the Humvee flipped.

1084
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:12.88
And he was, there's the inertia of the Humvee flip and he couldn't get out of the turret.

1085
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:18.24
And, uh, it was up armoured. And so when it flips, it obviously kills the gunner.

1086
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:23.60
There's no way he's going to get out. And so, mandatory 24 hours sake stand down

1087
01:05:24.32 --> 01:05:29.04
to take our phones and all that stuff. And, you know, hey, don't write home, don't call anyone.

1088
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:38.48
This is, you know, we got a little bite by the SOP. That was, uh, uh, you know, that was, uh,

1089
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:45.04
one of, like, and then I opening Dillman. That was like, okay, this is the real Dill. Like, this,

1090
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:51.12
we're not, this is a life-and-dev game we're playing. And I'll never forget when we got back

1091
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:55.60
to 20 on bombs, which I don't remember for a couple days later, three days later, day later, or whatever.

1092
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:01.76
But we wake up and we go to formation. And we walk out to go to formation and, um,

1093
01:06:01.76 --> 01:06:07.76
and, um, then everywhere you look, you saw a piece of computer paper, just a regular piece of paper,

1094
01:06:08.48 --> 01:06:12.32
turn horizontally, they were taped all over the place. Everywhere you looked,

1095
01:06:13.36 --> 01:06:18.88
and all he said on him was complacency kills. Every where you looked, you saw that complacency

1096
01:06:18.88 --> 01:06:26.56
kills. And gunning it just printed out all these papers. And that, to this day, that sticks with me.

1097
01:06:26.56 --> 01:06:33.52
And I think about it, not every all the time, because we all get complacent.

1098
01:06:35.04 --> 01:06:40.88
But it could not be more true, whether it's literal, you know, or figuratively speaking, I mean,

1099
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:46.08
and of course, most of our lives nowadays, you get complacent. Yeah, you might not die,

1100
01:06:47.36 --> 01:06:52.96
but something can be irreversibly damaged. Well, yeah, I mean, I talk about that all the time,

1101
01:06:52.96 --> 01:06:56.80
they're just just the complacency, even the complacency on the little things in life.

1102
01:06:56.80 --> 01:07:00.32
That's just put you down the wrong path. Well, that's just the way it is. That's the reality.

1103
01:07:00.32 --> 01:07:07.76
Hey, man, and let me tell you that, um, I could be referred to as Captain complacency when it comes to that.

1104
01:07:08.64 --> 01:07:11.28
I'll be the first to tell you that I'm much more centered than saying,

1105
01:07:12.48 --> 01:07:19.68
I always say, you know, that God gave you the only son to suffer and down across as

1106
01:07:19.68 --> 01:07:24.88
any of those are going to be guys like me. The only differences I'm going to admit it,

1107
01:07:25.92 --> 01:07:31.68
you know, I'm going to own my flawedness. And I say all the time that I've stood with everything from

1108
01:07:31.68 --> 01:07:36.000
leaders of mankind, the presidents to the most savage individuals you'll ever meet and everything in

1109
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.36
between the one common denominator is everyone I'm equally fundamentally flawed.

1110
01:07:42.48 --> 01:07:45.52
Every single one. Yeah, no doubt about that. They just have different clothes on.

1111
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:52.72
That's it. That's what I'm saying, man, if we could stop, if we could just stop with this political

1112
01:07:52.72 --> 01:08:03.84
correctness and this false manufactured protection, we could get, I always say, if we, if you

1113
01:08:03.84 --> 01:08:09.60
took out self-interest and self-gain and the fight for the greater good, imagine where we would be right now.

1114
01:08:09.60 --> 01:08:15.52
Imagine where we would be, because we would be leaves and bounds ahead of where we are.

1115
01:08:16.72 --> 01:08:22.88
We would be light years ahead of where we are. If there was nothing to begin to help someone

1116
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:29.60
that you've never met and that can never repay you, you just do it. Because we've been so

1117
01:08:29.60 --> 01:08:36.96
conditioned to be selfish. And it's unfortunate because it's what I love about this guy,

1118
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:42.40
as a, for all it says, it purves is the godfather of the Marine Corps. People can say,

1119
01:08:43.44 --> 01:08:48.88
he may have been arrogant or pompous or whatever. But I guarantee he was the last one to eat.

1120
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:53.60
Yeah, I mean, he was definitely the last one to eat. And actually that books are great book and

1121
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:59.52
there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a big difference between his reputation of what people

1122
01:08:59.52 --> 01:09:04.40
thought about him that never worked with him. People that worked with him, the, the marines that

1123
01:09:04.40 --> 01:09:08.48
worked with him that served with him, that he would go around their foxholes at night in negative

1124
01:09:08.48 --> 01:09:16.40
25 degree weather and ask guys if they're okay and give him a shot of whiskey. I mean, he, they

1125
01:09:16.40 --> 01:09:21.36
loved him because he cared about those, be cared about them. That's the, the image, as a matter

1126
01:09:21.36 --> 01:09:26.56
fact, like he had this driver that was with him for a long time. Jones was his last name. And

1127
01:09:26.80 --> 01:09:31.12
Jones, people would come up and say, how did you stay with Chester Polar for so long? Didn't he

1128
01:09:31.12 --> 01:09:36.64
chew you out and demote you and he's like, no, the guy never yelled at me ever. That's, that's the

1129
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:42.000
difference. That's the difference between, that's the dichotomy between what this image was and what he

1130
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.76
was really like. The people who he would, the reason he had a reputation for being, you know, super

1131
01:09:50.72 --> 01:09:55.84
I guess I guess direct with people was the way he went up the chain of command. When he would tell

1132
01:09:55.84 --> 01:09:59.92
an admiral out on a ship, like you better put those bombs when we need him right now or, you know,

1133
01:09:59.92 --> 01:10:04.40
he'll, I'll up the chain of command or he'd come back to America and say, hey, the binoculars that

1134
01:10:04.40 --> 01:10:09.60
you're building suck and they, and they steam up and we can't see anything. What's wrong with you?

1135
01:10:09.60 --> 01:10:14.56
So that's where he got the reputation. But down the chain of command, he, he was not like that. There's

1136
01:10:14.56 --> 01:10:18.08
another great story in there that I cover on the podcast where he catches a guy sleeping and

1137
01:10:18.08 --> 01:10:22.88
watch that are training. And he wakes the guy, guy up and he's the batiling commander. He wakes the guy

1138
01:10:22.88 --> 01:10:27.04
up and says, hey, what are you doing sleeping? What if your captain would have caught you? He would have,

1139
01:10:27.04 --> 01:10:31.12
he would have had me come and caught Marshal you. He'd been in the disaster. He got to stay wake old man.

1140
01:10:31.12 --> 01:10:36.32
That's his nickname for everyone was old man. But that's the difference is he cared, he cared so

1141
01:10:36.32 --> 01:10:41.84
much about his men. And, and you know, that's the, that's the incredibly hard part that we were

1142
01:10:41.84 --> 01:10:49.04
talking about earlier is like when he's when his son comes home from Vietnam and, you know,

1143
01:10:49.04 --> 01:10:54.88
he's like, his heart is broken. It's broken and he can't even speak and he can't he's just

1144
01:10:54.88 --> 01:11:00.64
convulsing with tears. And it's because, you know, he loved his son, but his son was represented

1145
01:11:00.64 --> 01:11:06.08
of a very marine and he said that. You know, he said that, it was like that, that the closing that

1146
01:11:06.08 --> 01:11:10.24
book, you know, he tells his wife, his wife says, what do you want to do now that it's all over?

1147
01:11:10.24 --> 01:11:15.76
And he's like, I want to see the face of every marine I have a server with. Dude, you know,

1148
01:11:15.76 --> 01:11:22.72
I mean, that right there. For anyone who's listening to this and questioning,

1149
01:11:22.72 --> 01:11:28.48
what is my purpose? Why am I alive? Why am I here? What's the point?

1150
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.72
Two things. And it's the same for every individual no matter what country no matter what little

1151
01:11:36.72 --> 01:11:44.24
village doesn't matter. We all have our here to do two things. Love and be loved.

1152
01:11:46.80 --> 01:11:50.96
That's it. Everything else is filler. Love and be loved.

1153
01:11:50.96 --> 01:11:59.04
That's it. It's hard to shit because we make it hard to shit. That's it.

1154
01:12:00.64 --> 01:12:08.08
When he saw his son that all came crashing down on him, that's it. It was reality.

1155
01:12:09.12 --> 01:12:15.76
It was one of those like in rather it was in Lewis' situation where

1156
01:12:15.76 --> 01:12:20.88
when you're severely wounded or you lose someone that you loved tremendously.

1157
01:12:22.88 --> 01:12:30.96
I mean with reckless abandonment, you love all the way. And if you're of the right

1158
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:35.52
warrior mindset or first responder law enforcement, you've been around that and you're the real

1159
01:12:35.52 --> 01:12:44.000
deal. You're probably just like me or you're you're incapable of loving halfway. They're incapable

1160
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:54.000
of it because if we did that, we're taking away from that in which we're supposed to be true to

1161
01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.76
in the honor. And that's the point. You don't get a piece of humble pie. You and hell the factory.

1162
01:13:02.56 --> 01:13:09.44
All that wants. And that's just what it is. And some guys don't come out of that.

1163
01:13:09.44 --> 01:13:15.04
You know, and if I if I wouldn't surrounded by people that were better than me

1164
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:25.28
and that refused to love me to death, I would be loose. And far be it for me to sit here and

1165
01:13:25.28 --> 01:13:33.28
look at you and say, not an option. It's not an option. Because one thing I've learned in this fight

1166
01:13:33.28 --> 01:13:40.48
is fight of mental health and of this floating noodle in between our ears. Is that no one gets a

1167
01:13:40.48 --> 01:13:48.08
pass? Nobody gets a pass. I don't care who you are, what you've been through, what you know,

1168
01:13:48.08 --> 01:13:56.72
who you know, you don't get a pass. And I've learned that the hard way from having to bury friends

1169
01:13:56.72 --> 01:14:08.16
over and over and over and over and to talk myself out of you're not worth it. It would be easier

1170
01:14:09.04 --> 01:14:16.40
for them if you weren't here. And letting the demons get the better of me. Because it's a constant

1171
01:14:17.12 --> 01:14:22.16
dance. Like when people say, oh, well, you know, Jake, you're practically a lot of pressure off.

1172
01:14:22.16 --> 01:14:30.000
You just work on your work and in life balance. Because it's, you're just going to find your balance.

1173
01:14:31.60 --> 01:14:35.84
Okay, here's some news. There is no balance. It's a constant dance.

1174
01:14:37.20 --> 01:14:43.28
You're constantly trying to figure it out. It's just like our enemies and our rack up,

1175
01:14:43.28 --> 01:14:47.76
guys, they're like, it's, we change our taxes, they change theirs. We change ours, they change theirs.

1176
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:54.000
We change ours. It's a constant dance. It's never finite. Right? Nothing is.

1177
01:14:55.84 --> 01:15:00.80
That's one of the things that makes life worth living. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and know

1178
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:07.60
what tomorrow has in store for me. What's the point? I just want to wake up and love and be loved.

1179
01:15:09.20 --> 01:15:16.16
All the way, not halfway. Be hotter, be cold. If you're lukewarm, get the hell out of my foxhole.

1180
01:15:16.16 --> 01:15:25.60
I don't want to fight with you. Let's talk about when you went on deployment now.

1181
01:15:26.56 --> 01:15:35.44
So it's 2004 is when you deploy like the summer of 2004? Yeah. And where do you guys deploy to?

1182
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:44.40
So we are primary. It was the SUNY triangle of our rack. Beautiful, beautiful place.

1183
01:15:44.40 --> 01:15:48.80
Yeah. We landed in Kuwait. We only in Kuwait. I think they call it camp.

1184
01:15:48.80 --> 01:15:53.12
Victory may be. I can't remember the name of it. It was before the pizza hots and subways and all that.

1185
01:15:53.12 --> 01:16:00.16
I know that for a fact. But we landed in Kuwait. We're only there for a couple days.

1186
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:08.24
We get on the burden on the fricates. This was on the on the tarmac in Kuwait getting ready to flow

1187
01:16:08.24 --> 01:16:19.36
our outside. And I think if I'm not mistaken, I think we were on the first three, see one,

1188
01:16:19.36 --> 01:16:26.96
30s we got on. We had to get off of because they weren't mechanically sound or whatever.

1189
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:33.92
Or just gunny just follow. Who knows? But we had to get off of minute one gunny.

1190
01:16:33.92 --> 01:16:40.32
Because I remember the fourth one and we're all sweating. Our asses off. It's miserable. Yeah.

1191
01:16:40.32 --> 01:16:46.72
It's miserable. And I remember the fourth one. I don't know if it was the crew chief,

1192
01:16:46.72 --> 01:16:51.68
the loadmaster, whoever, but gunny took someone somewhere and I'm pretty sure

1193
01:16:52.88 --> 01:16:58.24
it was a conversation pretty much like if this burden didn't take off, you're not going to go home.

1194
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:10.96
A life anyway. Because it sucked. We have everything on. We're from Marine. So we're geared out.

1195
01:17:11.76 --> 01:17:17.84
And it's was stuff we'll never use. Never. But it was on the gear list. Yeah, got to have it.

1196
01:17:19.44 --> 01:17:24.000
So we, but we ended up landed in the outside and I remember when we got off the burden, I was

1197
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:35.68
so I thought to myself, man, 20 and I'm pausing that bad. Yeah. And I was out of do that

1198
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:46.40
two year. I miss it already. And so we get off and we go to our tent where we're sleeping with our

1199
01:17:46.40 --> 01:17:56.08
bunk beds. And we start the brief the next day. And I remember we were... So is that where you

1200
01:17:56.08 --> 01:18:00.64
guys were going to be working out of? Where you guys are actually going to be camp at station to add

1201
01:18:00.64 --> 01:18:06.80
alasad primarily? Yeah, but I mean, rarely got to stay on the ground. That's where your

1202
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:13.44
headquarters were. Yeah, we're batiny. Okay. So we start the 40-hour brief.

1203
01:18:13.44 --> 01:18:22.16
We're in the middle of that and Captain walks in. We're one of the hangers.

1204
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:29.92
And you know, look on his face that you know, someone good, obviously. And it was because

1205
01:18:29.92 --> 01:18:36.56
during the lefcee rice seat of the unit we were placing got hit. And they lost. I don't want

1206
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:42.32
to miss quoted, but one of the guys I was just with this past week and was there.

1207
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:48.96
And that unit, we were placed two seven. And it was they had lost like an XO

1208
01:18:49.68 --> 01:18:54.48
first sergeant. Like it was bad. That's from one that was an ID strike.

1209
01:18:54.48 --> 01:19:01.84
It was ID with that direction. It was just a bad situation.

1210
01:19:01.84 --> 01:19:07.12
Yeah. After action. So they took fire and it was not like it wasn't isolated of that.

1211
01:19:07.12 --> 01:19:13.36
They hit ID goes and then they fight with RPGs. Gotcha. It was a

1212
01:19:13.36 --> 01:19:16.72
gnarly situation. They shouldn't have been in because it happened in a place that was

1213
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:26.16
friendly. And at the time actually when we were over there, I don't even, I think we still

1214
01:19:26.16 --> 01:19:30.72
call them roadside bomb. I don't even think we call them Ideja. I don't think we utilized that terminology.

1215
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:38.08
Yeah. If I'm not mistaken, again, I could be wrong what's happened before. But we, so we hear this.

1216
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:44.24
And it, I mean, it's just like really cool. Yeah, that's not good. That stuff's not supposed to happen.

1217
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:54.96
And so that was another big awakening moment, right? And but we get ready to leave.

1218
01:19:54.96 --> 01:20:03.52
And at this time, I'm a machine gun team leader. A little that I know I'd become leader

1219
01:20:03.52 --> 01:20:10.96
of the react team. Same as QRF, quick reaction force. So we, we have like the 16th

1220
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:18.24
vehicle convoy or something. Which would be a huge no-no nowadays. And I remember the

1221
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:22.48
server walk behind. It was like, hey, shit, we need someone to man that peg on the lead vehicle.

1222
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:28.24
And we're going to get behind the 240 on the lead vehicle. And I was like, who's going to jump on that pick?

1223
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:34.32
And we were just in brief hearing about Godwires. They put Godwires across the road, trying to

1224
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:46.16
to capitate gunners. And I left my first deployment in, I want to say, April or May of 2004. So

1225
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:51.36
this is, I mean, right. Yeah. Yeah. And I was just trying to think if we were using the term ID and I'm

1226
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:57.36
almost positive, we work. Because I remember, I remember, but you guys are special. Yeah, I know

1227
01:20:57.36 --> 01:21:02.48
I know, but I was trying to think I remember like, I'm actually envisioning a slide. We caught an ID

1228
01:21:02.48 --> 01:21:10.88
maker. And we had all this like, yeah, wires. And he had like clocks, like multiple clocks from a

1229
01:21:11.76 --> 01:21:20.24
from like a timers, like kitchen timers. And he's we had wires, kitchen timers, all this stuff.

1230
01:21:20.24 --> 01:21:24.56
And they're like, hey, this guy you caught, he's an innocent guy. And I was like, well, no. And they

1231
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:28.56
say, well, no, he's innocent. What evidence do you have? And I brought these pictures and I'm like,

1232
01:21:28.56 --> 01:21:33.92
look at the stuff that we took off this target. It's all ID stuff. And they were like, oh, okay. But it was

1233
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:38.24
the first, it was kind of first starting to assemble the idea that people were building these

1234
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:42.24
improvised explosive devices. I think we were using it, but you're right, might not have spread

1235
01:21:42.24 --> 01:21:48.000
the Marine Corps yet at this point. We're kind of slow. But we're deadly. I mean, I don't know,

1236
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.64
we might have. It was a long time ago. That's irrelevant. But because roadside bombs, that wasn't good enough.

1237
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:58.56
Yeah. So it was called an ID. Well, if it's not, if you don't have a don't bring them, don't

1238
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:05.92
turn it up. Don't turn it up. But we, so we, but we're out there. We have our convoy. And

1239
01:22:07.52 --> 01:22:15.12
so I asked the guys, okay, who's going to go man that pig is crickets. I was like, oh, very well.

1240
01:22:15.12 --> 01:22:20.80
Oh, I got it. I looked out and was like, hey, sir, I got it. I'm going to do it. Then of course. I

1241
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:29.44
know, oh, okay. No, I'm like, no, a few, a few, a few, a few, a few. When I die, yeah, just remember what

1242
01:22:29.44 --> 01:22:37.84
your letter needs to say. Because you were of a JJ. And let's see, a lot more colorful,

1243
01:22:37.84 --> 01:22:45.76
good. But I jumped up there, man. And it was, look, the pocket factor, pegged. You know,

1244
01:22:45.76 --> 01:22:50.24
pegged. Because I'm like, how do you see a God wire? I can you see the God wire? It is the sun.

1245
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:55.28
How to be hit in a certain way. Like, what is, what am I looking for? You know, you had, do you have

1246
01:22:55.28 --> 01:23:01.04
armored homies? No, most of them weren't. Yeah. And, you know, the most of them were two to our soft

1247
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:05.36
thoughts. Yeah, I get something like that. We had the turret was the turret. Just weird. Like six

1248
01:23:05.36 --> 01:23:08.16
on. And the vehicles of six. That's better. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's

1249
01:23:08.16 --> 01:23:12.72
because we're comfortable. I mean, I'd rather be in that than a Humvee if I'm in the lead vehicle.

1250
01:23:12.72 --> 01:23:20.16
I'd rather be in a hair year. But it was, but we, that's why you signed up for an infantry

1251
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:25.44
get saw. That's right. And we hated, and, you know, the pilots, it was like they were bunching

1252
01:23:25.92 --> 01:23:32.32
pre-medums. And we would see him come in and land and go to their air condition cans. And then

1253
01:23:32.32 --> 01:23:37.76
we're like, you know, they're eating steak and shrimp. You know, they're, they're all comfortable

1254
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:46.64
in there. And they're swan they're sleep number bed. So, you know, you make all this stuff up in your head.

1255
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:50.56
Dude, I'll tell you what, you made that up in your head. We had a World War II pilot on here.

1256
01:23:50.56 --> 01:23:57.84
Jim Kunkl. And he was literally saying, like, hey, the, the war in Europe for me, he was a P38 pilot.

1257
01:23:57.84 --> 01:24:02.08
He's like, my mission's working. It like, 45 minutes. He's like, they're almost back in on the

1258
01:24:02.08 --> 01:24:06.08
back in base. Now, of course, those 45 minutes were pretty sketchy. You ended up getting shot down.

1259
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:10.80
But, you know, a lot of the missions that he did is exactly what you said. That's the reality of

1260
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:18.16
being a pilot. That's the reality of it. And it's, you know, and then, but until you need them,

1261
01:24:18.16 --> 01:24:22.72
oh, God, yeah. Well, yeah, of course. And then the first time that happened, you're like, oh,

1262
01:24:22.72 --> 01:24:27.60
I can't hook you. Yeah, we need those guys. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But it's interesting because it's a,

1263
01:24:27.60 --> 01:24:33.04
there's a line guy. You know, it was a grunt. I mean, you're trained from day one. Every other job

1264
01:24:33.04 --> 01:24:38.48
in the United States military is to support you. Yeah, that's true. You know, you're trained that,

1265
01:24:38.48 --> 01:24:44.000
which, I'm not, I mean, I won't say if I agree, you're just agree with it now, because I,

1266
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.20
it's like I tell civilians like, think of them of the military as a giant will with a lot of

1267
01:24:49.20 --> 01:25:00.000
spokes. Combat guys are like a super small portion of one spoke. Yeah. It takes a lot of moving parts

1268
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.04
to make this machine turn. That's true. And so it's, it's, rather it's in support. Like,

1269
01:25:05.04 --> 01:25:10.000
listen, I'm over that. I don't need, I don't need that anymore. Like I understand why guys think that

1270
01:25:10.72 --> 01:25:15.92
I understand the mindset. There's a, there's a great, I was listening to some hack worth talking

1271
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:20.72
Colonel David Hackworth and one of the things that he said, he was trying to explain how many people

1272
01:25:20.72 --> 01:25:26.72
were in combat Vietnam in combat. And it was like 10% of the troops. So at the peak of Vietnam,

1273
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:32.64
there was 560,000 people in country in Vietnam and like 50,000 of them were actually engaged in combat

1274
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:38.64
at that at any one time. And that's, you know, probably a pretty good figure. A lot of the world,

1275
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:43.12
where one world to world war two statistics are the same. It's like 10 to one. There's 10 support

1276
01:25:43.12 --> 01:25:47.36
people for every one person that's going to like close close with and destroy the enemy.

1277
01:25:47.36 --> 01:25:55.28
No, no, no, no. It is. Yeah. I mean, it's, I would never look at a supply guy or of course,

1278
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:00.40
when I was in, I did all the time. I'm like, I put up no chips, put up you bait or whatever.

1279
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:04.96
This loop is shit as what you say. But like I, I see him now and it's like, hey, I'm

1280
01:26:04.96 --> 01:26:08.80
how pretty sure he's like, oh, well, I couldn't, I didn't do anything like, and I'm like, hey,

1281
01:26:08.80 --> 01:26:18.24
first of all, there is no Richter skill on painted suffering. You know, what makes it unique is that

1282
01:26:18.24 --> 01:26:27.44
it's unique to the individual. You can't grade it. So like your, you know, your spring to ankle

1283
01:26:27.44 --> 01:26:33.44
when you were, you roll your ankle playing basketball there in your lunch hour. How do you know

1284
01:26:33.44 --> 01:26:39.52
that didn't hurt as bad is my 50-intimey to come out of my left leg? It might have.

1285
01:26:41.52 --> 01:26:46.88
Question you a little bit on that one, but the point, the, how the hell did we get talking about this?

1286
01:26:46.88 --> 01:26:51.68
Hey, support people in the military. They do a great job. Then we wouldn't, the front line

1287
01:26:51.68 --> 01:26:55.12
troops wouldn't be able to do anything without them. So that's what I'm saying. And vice versa,

1288
01:26:55.12 --> 01:26:58.56
if the front line troops weren't there, the, the support people would have no job. That's the

1289
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:03.84
attitude I always had. And we were a team that had to cover move together. And if the intel people

1290
01:27:03.84 --> 01:27:09.44
didn't supply the intel and if the, if the CDs didn't build the bases and keep the generators running

1291
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:13.84
and the combat engineers were not clearing it. I mean, it's like, it takes a try. Exactly. And so that's

1292
01:27:13.84 --> 01:27:20.80
my point. And that's like, listen, if you're still in and you're in a non-combat role, be proud of what you're

1293
01:27:20.80 --> 01:27:25.92
done. Yeah, no, you're proud of. You know, I have guys that I meet now and they say, well, I was in from,

1294
01:27:25.92 --> 01:27:30.72
you know, 84 to 90. And I never did anything. I was like, hey, you did what your country asked you to do.

1295
01:27:30.72 --> 01:27:39.92
Yeah, you know, I stopped at that mindset, man. You've been conditioned just to call it what it is.

1296
01:27:39.92 --> 01:27:46.72
My guys like I used to be to believe you didn't do anything. Okay, well, the more mature me,

1297
01:27:46.72 --> 01:27:52.48
still pretty dumb, but the more mature me is here to tell you, thank you for carrying the flag

1298
01:27:52.48 --> 01:27:58.16
before I did. Yeah. Yeah. That's another for it is like, who is going to train you? Who's the

1299
01:27:58.16 --> 01:28:03.12
D.I.s that put you through boot camp? And who's the guys that train them? They're in 1984, right?

1300
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:08.08
You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, long chain. It's a gift that keeps on giving, you know. And it's,

1301
01:28:08.08 --> 01:28:14.48
but he served. You're doing more than most. You know, you're doing more than most. Be proud of that

1302
01:28:14.48 --> 01:28:21.68
fact. And so, but I, but I remember being, we, we leave the wire for the first time in Alessad

1303
01:28:21.68 --> 01:28:29.12
and so we had guys driving the sixth time that, that were motor to you guys that weren't our

1304
01:28:29.12 --> 01:28:35.36
guys. So I didn't know him. It was like a, I don't know if he's like a Lance Koolie and then there's

1305
01:28:35.36 --> 01:28:39.84
like a staff sergeant and they had driver seat and I'm up on the turret, right? And so I'm just like,

1306
01:28:39.84 --> 01:28:48.88
all right, whatever. And so we're coming, we come out of the gate and we bang a left and we're

1307
01:28:48.88 --> 01:28:55.52
headed to our first checkpoint, which by the way, the Iragonash Garden Iragon police knew.

1308
01:28:55.52 --> 01:28:59.36
What are our checkpoints were when we were leaving when we're gonna get there? So that's awesome.

1309
01:28:59.36 --> 01:29:04.16
Yeah, because, you know, there's some really, really smart people in DC that thought that was a good idea.

1310
01:29:04.16 --> 01:29:12.80
And yeah, so that obviously that, that standard operating procedure didn't last for a long

1311
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:20.96
because we knew it was about idea and but you know, we're had to get back to them like, hey,

1312
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:27.04
bombs and stuff, just follow us everywhere we go. It's weird. It's almost like they know we're going

1313
01:29:27.04 --> 01:29:37.04
to be there. Imagine that, you know. And so I remember, I could take some type of contact right

1314
01:29:37.04 --> 01:29:45.36
and I'm, I'm weird vehicle and the dude and the driver stops in the middle of a bridge.

1315
01:29:46.56 --> 01:29:53.52
And I just think of a member in training. Do not stop on a bridge. And so I'm telling us

1316
01:29:53.52 --> 01:29:58.96
do like get off the bridge. And he's like looking at the staff sergeant, German saloon,

1317
01:29:58.96 --> 01:30:06.000
like, what the hell do you see on that mean? And so I start taking them in his home, like get off the

1318
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.16
bridge. And that's the assorted news. That's where it's like, dude, just get off the bridge.

1319
01:30:10.16 --> 01:30:18.16
I was like a good idea. Yeah. And so it was, um, new eye cap check or push. Yeah, I do. We got off the bridge.

1320
01:30:18.16 --> 01:30:25.44
And I'm like, hey, genius, how do you know that that thing wasn't going to blow?

1321
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:32.48
Well, don't stop on a bridge ever. Your motor T. I just shocked that someone didn't tell you,

1322
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:40.08
don't stop on a bridge because you're you're sitting duck. Yeah. And it's like, that was my like

1323
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:48.24
welcome to high rack moment when it was, um, and man, we just started everything after that

1324
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:54.40
pretty pretty much as blurs together. And until the day that we got told that we were going to

1325
01:30:54.40 --> 01:31:00.16
go to do lab, which was for all intents of purposes of an ammo dump was pretty much what

1326
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:05.92
do lab was. And that's where we were, you know, surgeons were going to get on exploded ordinance.

1327
01:31:05.92 --> 01:31:12.72
And I mean, thousands and thousands of thousands of RPGs, you know, AKs, 7.62 rounds,

1328
01:31:12.72 --> 01:31:18.64
mortars, I mean thousands. And we had to combat engineers out there all day, every day,

1329
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:24.16
I'm blowing stuff. I mean, they just couldn't blow it quick enough because we would find so many

1330
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:31.76
of these weapon cash was everywhere. It was insane. And so, but we go through, we get to up to the

1331
01:31:31.76 --> 01:31:39.04
point of, you know, it's a little after our moth that we're there and we get the order that we're going

1332
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.12
to go to do lab, which for most of us was like, okay, so we can breathe some kickback time,

1333
01:31:45.12 --> 01:31:51.76
relax. I had a bad feeling about it. Right my gut as soon as they told us, I heard do lab and

1334
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:56.32
I knew it was our turn to go, this is actually the primary do lab about. I had a, I got a bad feeling

1335
01:31:56.32 --> 01:32:04.40
of my gut, but know what it was. And so my role was when I left, when I left the states,

1336
01:32:04.40 --> 01:32:12.88
and I told my family, hey, listen, here's the deal. Don't send me anything. Don't write me.

1337
01:32:12.88 --> 01:32:18.32
I'm not going to write you. Don't watch the news and no news is good news. I'll see you in seven

1338
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:23.92
months. Because in my mind, I had a job to do and I didn't need them in my head with their first

1339
01:32:23.92 --> 01:32:30.48
world bullshit. And because my family puts the jury in springer, and so definitely didn't need that.

1340
01:32:31.36 --> 01:32:35.52
And so that was my mindset. But we get, we're told we're going to do lab, so I get this

1341
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:41.52
weird feeling of my gut. And I'm like, damn, why don't know what that is? It's the night before we

1342
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:49.20
head out and you know, get a shower and a hot shower and I'm walking back to our tent from the

1343
01:32:49.20 --> 01:32:57.52
shower trailer and a walk by Gunny. And Gunny, you just saw it to Gunny, man. He used like a 23-year

1344
01:32:57.52 --> 01:33:04.72
gunny, and he earned it. And I loved them. Everybody loved them. You know, and he was one of the guys

1345
01:33:04.72 --> 01:33:09.60
where if you tell him good morning, and he didn't tell you, if he said, if you don't hear

1346
01:33:09.60 --> 01:33:17.36
something back like, go after your mom, if you hear like good morning back, Gunny, he's pissed about

1347
01:33:17.36 --> 01:33:22.08
something and it's going to be a long day. But like if you're like, go after your mom, you're like

1348
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:29.76
sweets, Gunny's in a good mood. He's just, he was that guy, you know, and everybody loved them.

1349
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:34.96
Everybody respected them because he demanded it. And he commanded it because he would be the first

1350
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:43.04
guy if it pops off. He's going to be right there. He's not, he's not ducking behind anything. He's

1351
01:33:43.04 --> 01:33:50.48
the dude walking up and down the line smoking a cigar. That's that gunny. He's that guy and it was just

1352
01:33:50.48 --> 01:33:58.24
an abundant amount of respect he had. And even if you, even if you hated him, you loved to hate them.

1353
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:09.76
You know, but I love the dude because it was for me he was what the Marine Corps met as one individual.

1354
01:34:09.76 --> 01:34:16.88
And I dug that about him. You know, I was like, that's, I need to be around him all the time. I want

1355
01:34:16.88 --> 01:34:23.76
more of what's in his head in mind. I can learn a tremendous amount from this guy. And so I'm

1356
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:29.12
walking back into the tent. He's in front of the tent. I said, good evening, Gunny. And I walked

1357
01:34:29.12 --> 01:34:34.40
behind him and say, if any grabs like the back of my skibby shirt and pulls me back towards him and

1358
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:43.44
any hug me, we said, I love you, shit. And I was like, I don't know, dude, my hands. Like, I'm, like, what

1359
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:50.24
do I do? Do I say it back? Is this a trap? What do I do? And this sounds like screw it, man. I mean,

1360
01:34:50.24 --> 01:34:57.92
I've been dirty before. All of you two guns. I mean, I'll never forget he just looked at me

1361
01:34:57.92 --> 01:35:05.44
and writing my face and just said, you're going to be alright. So I'll do that. So then I was like,

1362
01:35:05.44 --> 01:35:13.28
okay, something's not right. At this point, I'm 100% convinced something's not right. I didn't know

1363
01:35:13.28 --> 01:35:19.84
what it was, but I knew it wasn't right. So I broke my card and I went to the phone tent,

1364
01:35:20.80 --> 01:35:26.08
called my family and the last person I call was my dad. And you know, you have the two,

1365
01:35:26.08 --> 01:35:32.08
three second delay. And I knew it was about 10 30 night in Streetport, Louisiana. And I knew you

1366
01:35:32.08 --> 01:35:37.52
was home alone because my stepmom and my little brother were at the ranch of San Antonio and the answer

1367
01:35:37.52 --> 01:35:42.24
was the phone and I said, hey, pop. And he knew me because I'm the only kid that calls him pop.

1368
01:35:43.28 --> 01:35:50.56
The first words out of his mouth were why am I talking to you. It's almost like he knew that I knew

1369
01:35:51.36 --> 01:35:58.88
something wasn't right. And I said, I just wanted to tell you how much I love you. And what you,

1370
01:35:58.88 --> 01:36:05.20
you being my father means to me as your son. Because at this point in our life,

1371
01:36:05.20 --> 01:36:10.40
in our journey, it's father and son was, that's pretty much where it ended. He was my dad. I was a son.

1372
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:16.48
That was it. Because my older brother, he was born and God just touched his forehead and said,

1373
01:36:16.48 --> 01:36:21.76
athlete. And my dad was baseball player and my brother's baseball player always hated it. That is

1374
01:36:21.76 --> 01:36:30.40
the slowest sport known to mankind. It's like watching paint dry. And so I always, growing up,

1375
01:36:30.40 --> 01:36:36.16
felt like I was always chasing my brother. I was chasing this this unbelievable athlete that I was

1376
01:36:36.16 --> 01:36:43.04
never going to be better than when it came to athleticism no matter what sport. But I was chasing

1377
01:36:43.04 --> 01:36:48.64
that. And then I was like, okay, well, I'm going to go play baseball, the try and appease my dad to show

1378
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:52.80
him like, hey, I can do this through. And I sucked. I was never going to run. It was never going to

1379
01:36:52.80 --> 01:37:00.64
get that. You know, football, knowing now baseball is an art almost. It's a calculated art where

1380
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:11.36
with football, if you can run into another human with 100% focus and 100% will of breaking that man's

1381
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:19.44
will by making your body collide with his as hard as you can, you can play football. To a certain

1382
01:37:19.44 --> 01:37:26.16
extent, you can play football. Why did I love that? Because for me, it was an outlet of the

1383
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:32.32
ingrat aggression that I had. It's a kid growing up and the the antithesis of the cookie cutter

1384
01:37:32.32 --> 01:37:39.68
childhood. And so at this point that I'm leaving, you know, my father and I, it was, we weren't where

1385
01:37:39.68 --> 01:37:46.88
I felt like we should be as father and son. You know, this is a conversation that I've had with my

1386
01:37:46.88 --> 01:37:53.92
dad since obviously. And so when I told him, like, I just want you to know, it's important that

1387
01:37:53.92 --> 01:38:01.76
you know how much I love and respect you and how much I owe you for being there when you were

1388
01:38:01.76 --> 01:38:11.84
adult, a shitty hand, and you had us kids on your own. And you leaned in, you leaned in, and you

1389
01:38:11.84 --> 01:38:20.56
boat up, and I owe you till I die, I'll owe you. And I needed you to know that. And so he said,

1390
01:38:20.56 --> 01:38:26.32
how long is this passion? I said nine days. And yeah, he knew not to ask where you're going,

1391
01:38:26.32 --> 01:38:32.48
what are you doing? Because the people that listen to your every phone call would, you're called

1392
01:38:32.48 --> 01:38:38.56
would be over. And he said, I bet I want to hear from you nine days. He said, I better hear from you nine

1393
01:38:38.56 --> 01:38:44.96
days. And I said, you will, pop. I love you man. He just said, I love you too, and ended with

1394
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:50.64
your better be okay. And I hung up. And it was one of those moments where I was like,

1395
01:38:53.04 --> 01:39:05.44
as a at the time I'm 21 years old, and I realized, I have, I have no control over anything.

1396
01:39:05.44 --> 01:39:13.28
Nothing. I feel like I think I can. I think I have control and

1397
01:39:13.92 --> 01:39:18.96
in protecting my team and making sure my team's okay. I have no control over anything.

1398
01:39:20.24 --> 01:39:27.84
It was one of those human moments where I realized, I'm just as vulnerable as everyone else.

1399
01:39:27.84 --> 01:39:35.12
There's nothing special about me. I can be the biggest, strongest, toughest. It doesn't matter.

1400
01:39:36.88 --> 01:39:42.08
It does not matter. Because when it's your time, it's your time. That's it.

1401
01:39:43.04 --> 01:39:45.36
Doesn't matter what you know, doesn't matter how well-trained you are.

1402
01:39:46.48 --> 01:39:51.28
If God pulls your card, you're done. So it was a very, very

1403
01:39:51.28 --> 01:39:59.68
sobering and humbling moment for me. And we left out the next morning to go to Alice.

1404
01:39:59.68 --> 01:40:04.64
It's our go to do love. We get out to do love, and we start

1405
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:11.20
patrol on the perimeter, and for Reactors call, of course, me and the React team, which

1406
01:40:11.20 --> 01:40:17.44
me and nine Marines would go to wherever the React is, and but I always had that.

1407
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:23.84
Have you feeling in my gut that it didn't affect my job, it didn't affect

1408
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:30.40
our day-to-day operations and what we were doing, but I knew it was something was coming.

1409
01:40:31.12 --> 01:40:37.36
And then one night we had two guys coming, the main gate, and they were in like a white opal.

1410
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:42.56
Pulled in the main gate and pretty much just laid down on both sides of the car.

1411
01:40:42.56 --> 01:40:49.76
Obviously not in all the behavior. Well these guys were high profile targets that

1412
01:40:51.04 --> 01:40:55.92
once we find out who they are and radio batayan, they're like, don't let them out of your sight.

1413
01:40:57.28 --> 01:41:02.80
And so we ended up having, and for the React team we had two two-door saw-top on Vs.

1414
01:41:03.60 --> 01:41:08.08
That's what we had to operate in, and the guy, we had one guy in the back of one vehicle,

1415
01:41:08.08 --> 01:41:12.80
another guy in the back of the second vehicle and they both had MTMR, he boxed the duct tape on

1416
01:41:12.80 --> 01:41:19.12
their head because we were out of hoods and so it provided that no overcome. And you know how

1417
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:27.12
them all, they weren't growing anywhere. Well so the I-Racki National Guard also got to be on the

1418
01:41:27.12 --> 01:41:33.36
same net frequencies, radio frequency. So they're hearing all the transmissions next thing

1419
01:41:33.36 --> 01:41:41.76
you know they show up and there's a lot of them and they pull in and circle us. Obviously it's

1420
01:41:41.76 --> 01:41:48.80
show of force and say you know these guys same thing you went through about the ID maker, the

1421
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:54.64
bomb maker, you know these guys, they're no threat. These guys are good, you need a lot of them go,

1422
01:41:55.04 --> 01:42:00.56
you know. No. And I remember one of the guys it was like the kernel of the Racki National

1423
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:07.68
Guard and he said we you need the the tur- the interpreters there and I remember him saying something

1424
01:42:07.68 --> 01:42:13.84
along the lines of we need to take a director from a spear officer and we were like a bro.

1425
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:17.84
I don't know if you've been working with the army or whatever, well we don't give a shit who you are

1426
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:26.48
because we know that you're probably a bad guy. So no, they're not leaving.

1427
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:34.16
And that situation got super gnarly super quick and I was thinking of myself like

1428
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:43.60
I remember telling one of the guys that had a nine to one of the dudes had and I told him if he

1429
01:42:43.60 --> 01:42:51.20
so much of sneezes, push his brains to the side of his head and I could hear that beretta nine

1430
01:42:51.20 --> 01:42:58.40
mill I could hear it rattling because he was it was I'm sure it was from pre-written um

1431
01:42:59.28 --> 01:43:06.80
the Marines you know and I could hear but I could hear the slide rattling against the barrel and I was like

1432
01:43:08.16 --> 01:43:13.84
did that do you shake and hard? But I knew if that dude so much has sneezed.

1433
01:43:13.84 --> 01:43:22.000
I knew it would happen and so we were by the grace of God we had because we were part of

1434
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.16
weapons between but weapons company it just got done doing a coordinate knock or whatever they were

1435
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:34.000
doing and they're listening to this transmission over the net so we're talking with Battalion saying like

1436
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.96
hey this is escalating and there's about 65 of them and 10 of us so they were heavily outnumbered

1437
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:50.40
obviously but we need some serious shit is gonna go down and so weapons company pulls in

1438
01:43:51.28 --> 01:43:55.44
I don't even remember if it's an hour later three hours it seemed like a freaking eternity

1439
01:43:55.92 --> 01:44:03.44
but they pull in and make a circle around the ING good times bro and of course the weapons company are the ones

1440
01:44:03.44 --> 01:44:12.40
with you know the Martin 19's 50 cows 84 we had 84's too but I mean that all all the big you know

1441
01:44:12.40 --> 01:44:19.12
when they pull in you know like okay those guys have big stuff that obviously goes bang a lot

1442
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000
and so these guys pulled in and it was almost in unison the iron the iron can actually guard guys

1443
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.28
dropping their AKs hands in there no me stuff no me stuff you know I was like yep those are our home

1444
01:44:31.28 --> 01:44:36.48
me so you know like so let's and so those guys they take them and take them back to a

1445
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:44.40
Alicid and you know and they they pop corn far disappear just gone let me I'm sure some

1446
01:44:44.40 --> 01:44:50.48
super secret squirrel age just came in and got them or whatever we finally go to bed down and

1447
01:44:52.24 --> 01:44:58.96
I go up to the command post and dock was up at the command post was just turned to sit in the vehicle

1448
01:44:58.96 --> 01:45:05.28
that that powers the command post and this is turned to count the flares long you free to use and

1449
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:11.20
when was it shot what color was it and then we turned into Intel and then they tried crack code

1450
01:45:11.20 --> 01:45:18.40
decipher code and so we saw a dock and telling them like you know okay man this was nice I can't

1451
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:27.04
know that that's crazy and so I can barely keep my eyes open at this point drillins

1452
01:45:27.04 --> 01:45:34.72
worn off and you know series the high high series low low's no gray area that's what being a

1453
01:45:34.72 --> 01:45:42.16
run is and being a warfighter is and so I built a dock I got a bed down smoked let's go bed down

1454
01:45:42.16 --> 01:45:51.28
the words man and so I go and take my boots off and I'm so tired the take my boots off

1455
01:45:51.28 --> 01:45:59.28
alone my cot and I ragged being Iraq especially in O4 not even 20 minutes later I mean my dog

1456
01:45:59.28 --> 01:46:08.32
didn't even start to breathe react and I came Murphy you're dick you know it was like if that's the

1457
01:46:08.32 --> 01:46:16.40
way Murphy works dude not a fan not a fan of of that Murphy and so you know wake up and I'm like

1458
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:21.44
all right got a wake up team so I rubbed her back and was especially nothing's in her ear

1459
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:30.48
because that's how we do it and we these got they're all pissed like yeah this is a bunch of bullshit

1460
01:46:31.68 --> 01:46:38.08
like a man's cuz it's the paycheck that's why we do it but what was the call that came in

1461
01:46:38.48 --> 01:46:45.44
what they what was going down it was um I think it was someone in there someone had gotten in the

1462
01:46:45.44 --> 01:46:51.28
A.O. when supposed to be in the A.O. and you know neutralize threat type thing and I just like

1463
01:46:51.28 --> 01:46:59.76
get up and I'm I'm carrying I think I slide my boots on anytime and I walk out of the tent

1464
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:04.40
soon as I walk out of the tent that feeling I had my gut went right in my throat

1465
01:47:05.60 --> 01:47:10.72
rules right into my throat and I knew we're about to get it I knew

1466
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:16.64
it sure as I was that the sun was gonna come up I knew we were gonna get it I didn't know how bad

1467
01:47:16.64 --> 01:47:21.76
it was gonna be I didn't know by what I didn't know to the extent but I knew it was gonna happen

1468
01:47:23.12 --> 01:47:31.60
and so I by the I took measures and did things that otherwise wouldn't have done and you

1469
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:36.08
mean caught my grandfather talked to me from beyond the grave you can call a god and call whatever you want

1470
01:47:36.08 --> 01:47:40.96
good news is that I can have my beliefs and you can have yours and odds are we're not gonna

1471
01:47:40.96 --> 01:47:47.28
get our heads cut off because we live in a free society and so I my commanding officer was out there

1472
01:47:49.60 --> 01:47:55.68
to do a report on what it went down the night before he was sleeping and but I knew he had a bomb

1473
01:47:55.68 --> 01:48:01.12
blanket and so I took the bomb blanket out of the pasture seat of the one of the only up on

1474
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:07.28
where it on me's we had at the time and I went to the lead vehicle and I told the driver

1475
01:48:07.28 --> 01:48:12.32
scoot over the lead vehicles to this day of a great friend of mine put the bomb blanket down

1476
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:16.64
and I told the guys button up if they gave it to us for protection but put it on now

1477
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:23.12
which I usually wasn't a little hardcore about just because when it's 120 something that

1478
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:29.44
agrees and you you have all that gear on more gear is not optimal to the whole being comfortable

1479
01:48:29.44 --> 01:48:37.28
thing and I'm sure the guys knew something was up and then I take the radio from the arrow

1480
01:48:38.56 --> 01:48:47.52
and everything's buttoned up a black jacket couple or wiley access for shattered proof

1481
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.20
that they should have said kind of shattered proof and then it's the growing protector

1482
01:48:57.20 --> 01:49:03.04
they gave it we had it on and so I get on the horn with my right arm driving on my left

1483
01:49:04.24 --> 01:49:13.52
I gasped it and see you're driving I'm driving driving and just because I had you put the

1484
01:49:13.52 --> 01:49:20.88
bomb blanket under the under the driver seat and so I don't know it was just reaction I mean

1485
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:25.92
something was guiding me to do all these things you know I'm not I can't tell you what the

1486
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:31.36
lot of numbers are like I can't tell I don't have BSP I guess me I'm not a fortune teller

1487
01:49:31.36 --> 01:49:35.84
like something was guiding me to do these things and you just put that bomb blanket under

1488
01:49:35.84 --> 01:49:40.80
their just because you just could something told me put it in the driver seat and get in the

1489
01:49:40.80 --> 01:49:47.44
driver seat take the radio I did all these things I punched it three minutes later we had a triple

1490
01:49:47.44 --> 01:49:55.92
stack press replading nighted so three three one five five Mike Mike and Laman's turn with that

1491
01:49:55.92 --> 01:50:02.72
means is the big ass bomb yeah that's about 175 pounds of explosives it's a lot it's freaking big

1492
01:50:02.72 --> 01:50:08.88
blew up directly beneath me blew me about 30 feet at top of the home v stuck the landing with my

1493
01:50:08.88 --> 01:50:15.52
head because again Marines blew even good forms and I like to say because God's a comedian I

1494
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:19.20
never lost consciousness on everyone into shock I remember the whole thing took the black

1495
01:50:19.20 --> 01:50:25.52
clock 42 minutes come get me so I love to look at people when they're like such a long day

1496
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:34.80
it worked my really hold on let me throw some perspective your way but that's only when I'm in a bad mood

1497
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:45.04
but it was I knew mid-air it was bad I knew it was bad I knew this was not good at all

1498
01:50:45.04 --> 01:50:53.36
and when I hit the deck I couldn't breathe because the as you know the series of events on

1499
01:50:53.36 --> 01:50:59.12
explosion a million things happen in a nanosecond especially when it's that big of an explosion

1500
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:05.36
and so it was when the dashboard disengaged and steer will hit me my chest it made exploded all my

1501
01:51:05.36 --> 01:51:13.12
mags hit me my chest and temporary collapsed both my lungs before I was blown out and whole

1502
01:51:13.12 --> 01:51:21.12
series of things happened before during this process causing injuries and I hit the deck and

1503
01:51:22.72 --> 01:51:28.40
I knew I'm hurt bad I can't breathe can't hear anything it's just ringing and

1504
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:35.28
first thing I do is talk to God first thing I did before I even did self assessment

1505
01:51:35.28 --> 01:51:41.36
this is talk to guys I can't see out of my right eye thanks to this shattered proof well yeah

1506
01:51:43.36 --> 01:51:50.24
because they shattered both of them all yeah there's there's something called a triple stacked

1507
01:51:50.24 --> 01:51:54.64
idea I don't know what glasses are gonna hang with that one saying hey listen man false

1508
01:51:54.64 --> 01:52:02.000
advertising right yeah so we got it but we um I'm there a great company I'm just you know

1509
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.56
gonna find light in every situation but we but I talked to God right away this is exactly what I said

1510
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.48
hey big man I know this is bad all I'm asking is that you don't take me in front of my family

1511
01:52:17.92 --> 01:52:20.96
it's all I'm asking don't let my brothers watch me die

1512
01:52:22.24 --> 01:52:26.88
soon as this kids leave the deck come all yours just please don't let my brothers watch me die

1513
01:52:26.88 --> 01:52:34.24
talk here about and I started the self assessment which starts with checking your junk

1514
01:52:35.20 --> 01:52:38.48
the only thing that worked was my right arm everything else shattered or broken

1515
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:46.08
gonna find out all my ribs are broken so I didn't open anything and so I go

1516
01:52:47.76 --> 01:52:54.48
move my growing flap and check my junk and I was like okay that's there everything else has been

1517
01:52:54.48 --> 01:53:03.28
dataable like we're to work through we will survive and but then I looked at my my right

1518
01:53:03.28 --> 01:53:09.04
leg look normal but my right but my right foot and ankle hurt really bad

1519
01:53:10.08 --> 01:53:14.64
this is like a good broad broken well I didn't know it was crushed was the firewall

1520
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:20.72
and I'm gonna be folded up trust my right foot before I was blown out my left I looked at my left arm

1521
01:53:20.72 --> 01:53:26.80
and I remember seeing like daylight through my left arm part of my left hand was hanging down

1522
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:34.000
by my elbow it's all like okay that's might not might not keep the left arm

1523
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:41.76
and I looked down at my left leg which was turned outward like if you're sitting down with both

1524
01:53:41.76 --> 01:53:46.72
legs like you're gonna touch your toes my left leg was turned outward to the left and my foot

1525
01:53:46.72 --> 01:53:54.08
was inverted like with my toes pointing at me and my boot was blown off but my but everything was

1526
01:53:54.08 --> 01:53:59.84
there it was all over the place but it was there so I saw my fibi and my tibia saw all the damage

1527
01:53:59.84 --> 01:54:05.76
that was done to my left leg and because my my canmies were shredded and I thought two things

1528
01:54:05.76 --> 01:54:10.56
when I saw that first thing I thought was that's not supposed to be like that second thing I

1529
01:54:10.56 --> 01:54:17.52
thought was that that was confirmation that that was a very big explosion to be able to blow

1530
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:23.52
a lace-up combat boot off your leg and not take your leg with it is a massive explosion it's crazy

1531
01:54:24.88 --> 01:54:30.88
and so at this point I'm thinking how was the yeah guy in the guy in the blast blown

1532
01:54:30.88 --> 01:54:37.76
your drums was the other worst injury yeah man so literally blew up straight up directly beneath

1533
01:54:37.76 --> 01:54:42.72
the straight and straight up they must have buried a little bit enough that it just projected

1534
01:54:42.72 --> 01:54:47.36
right up into you yeah and it was so that standoff we had the night before

1535
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.96
it's when they buried it so all that was was a diversion is everyone was glued to the

1536
01:54:56.96 --> 01:55:07.76
radio so it was in a perfect spot it was the one spot around that entire area of operation

1537
01:55:07.76 --> 01:55:15.84
that you couldn't have eyes directly on the one spot yeah and so at this point the guys finally

1538
01:55:15.84 --> 01:55:25.68
make it up to me and there really there's a lot of freaking out because I mean I did the humv move

1539
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:31.84
oh yeah it was blown so did it get blown up yeah but it was I'll tell you this if we were in an

1540
01:55:31.84 --> 01:55:36.64
upper humv everyone was would be dead from over pressure absolutely there'd been no

1541
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:45.12
or four to go everyone would have died it would have been but it was blown up and over to the right

1542
01:55:46.32 --> 01:55:53.36
and second view of what affected but the guys are not too mean

1543
01:55:53.36 --> 01:56:02.40
at this point I'm back to telling God like a man just remember our deal

1544
01:56:02.40 --> 01:56:10.08
remember our deal and the guys are okay shit we got your bro we got you you know

1545
01:56:11.12 --> 01:56:17.44
we got you hanged tough and how to know where I was able to take a breath and the first thing

1546
01:56:17.44 --> 01:56:25.60
I said was developed 360 there like oh shit yeah it's like yeah no shit what's coming next yeah

1547
01:56:25.60 --> 01:56:31.84
how do we know we're not so about start taking fire which probably was was unlikely because there

1548
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:36.40
was no cover in that I mean there had been no where formed a hide and it would have been a

1549
01:56:36.40 --> 01:56:43.36
suicide mission on their part because we had one still very functional 240 and we knew how to

1550
01:56:43.36 --> 01:56:49.28
employ that weapon but they get me back on the second vehicle which was like I said

1551
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:57.28
still operational and getting me back up to the command post and man and little did I know that

1552
01:56:57.28 --> 01:57:05.36
that's that at that moment that's one my battle my personal war started right then that day

1553
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:13.12
and I get up there and doc same doc that I was talking to that was in the the on via

1554
01:57:13.84 --> 01:57:24.08
countenaflars it was working on me and I was I was I was pissed I was not happy

1555
01:57:24.56 --> 01:57:31.12
and I was yelling at doc and I was like doc you got to hit me you got to hit me and he's like I already

1556
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:38.48
did and so I'm like you I was like you're you're a stingy bastard because he only was hit me with

1557
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:42.48
two sticks of morphine and I knew he had more and all I knew was I was in a lot of pain he had the

1558
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:47.84
remedy and he wasn't given to me and I was like that's that's kind of bullshit you know I did

1559
01:57:47.84 --> 01:57:53.44
understand that the muscles around my lungs could relax so much I self-cate I didn't know

1560
01:57:53.44 --> 01:57:58.72
didn't care just knew I was in a lot of pain he had drugs and he was not giving him to me

1561
01:57:58.72 --> 01:58:08.80
little that I know the guy was the the tip of the spirits saving my life and um while this whole

1562
01:58:08.80 --> 01:58:17.28
situation was really gnarly and very painful and very very humbling I wouldn't traded it all because

1563
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:23.44
I got to tell everyone of those guys every single one of them I'm saying this is just like talking

1564
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:28.72
to my dad but I was talking to my brothers just got to tell everyone of them how much I love them how much

1565
01:58:28.72 --> 01:58:34.16
they meant to me how much I respected them and that this is real what we're doing is real look at me

1566
01:58:35.12 --> 01:58:41.20
look at me and remember this and go fight your balls off because this is what they want to do to

1567
01:58:41.20 --> 01:58:50.88
everyone of us don't let it happen again just just just learn from this you have to fight for me now

1568
01:58:50.88 --> 01:59:02.72
and that was you know it was a situation where they kept telling me you know he shook his

1569
01:59:02.72 --> 01:59:09.20
your bird home your bird home and it would piss me off every time they said it it was like I don't want

1570
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:15.12
to go home shut up I don't want to go home shake you get to go see your family you are my family

1571
01:59:15.12 --> 01:59:22.72
I'll see them when it's time to see them you know it was that so there's this whole series of thoughts

1572
01:59:23.44 --> 01:59:30.000
and emotions and you know I mean it was everything from laughing and crying everything in between

1573
01:59:30.48 --> 01:59:37.36
laughing again and they were scrambling to get the the metavac there and the problem was that we

1574
01:59:37.36 --> 01:59:42.88
didn't have any fighter escort and let's took forever because they were all dispatched so for

1575
01:59:42.88 --> 01:59:50.32
I mean they were all scrambled and so those finally it was a Texas Army National Guard pilot

1576
01:59:50.88 --> 01:59:56.16
that heard the transmission that you know this marine out of Texas category four rapidly

1577
01:59:56.16 --> 02:00:00.88
approaching category five. Scatigory four's urgent surgery category five being an

1578
02:00:00.88 --> 02:00:11.36
expectant and he finally got a screw and said I strew the rules for going to get this marine and he

1579
02:00:11.36 --> 02:00:19.60
came and got me and I remember the guys were loading me on the black hog and my

1580
02:00:19.60 --> 02:00:29.92
two sergeant was the last one on and man that was that was a that was an emotional experience dude because it was

1581
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:37.52
anyway two sergeant son and he kisses me on my forehead and he says we'll see soon jacklandin

1582
02:00:38.16 --> 02:00:42.56
he's always called me jacklandin because my first generation marine is jacklandin shex second generation

1583
02:00:42.56 --> 02:00:46.80
jacklandin chick junior so he always called me jacklandin because I guess Jake wasn't good enough

1584
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:52.40
but he but when he said it he was trying not to cry and I could tell in his eyes he was lying

1585
02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:01.60
which kind of motivated me and I was like well I'll show you I'm gonna prove you wrong and you are

1586
02:01:01.60 --> 02:01:10.40
gonna see me again even though it wasn't my choice right and so the the bird takes off man and

1587
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:22.88
um out of everything I've been through from day one to now that was the hardest moment hands

1588
02:01:22.88 --> 02:01:31.44
down no questions asked was leaving those guys hands down that was the hardest moment because that's when

1589
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:44.000
I was taught just how human I am and just how irrelevant I am and it was a very very hard

1590
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.40
experience to leave my family in harm's way and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it

1591
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:59.52
you talk about being humbled that will humble you and we get up in the in the air and I'm

1592
02:01:59.52 --> 02:02:06.40
able I'm able to get the attention I want to litter crews a young dude I mean again I'm 21 he's

1593
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:13.60
probably 18 19 but mill through years that's Eons and he comes up and he gets right he puts his left

1594
02:02:13.60 --> 02:02:18.64
you right in front of my face and I yelled as a lot of as I could because as you know on the back

1595
02:02:18.64 --> 02:02:22.72
one of the birds you know I've had said on the canter shoes and I yelled as far as I could

1596
02:02:22.72 --> 02:02:27.12
how long and I remember when I did I felt life leave my body I knew I was dying

1597
02:02:27.12 --> 02:02:33.36
did they turn it get you already the doctor yeah over and over yeah because I mean I was bleeding everywhere

1598
02:02:33.36 --> 02:02:40.40
yeah so do you have did you have strappin wounds yeah so it was not just your leg and you

1599
02:02:40.40 --> 02:02:46.08
were not strappin I had a trap on my my chin side of my face my my neck

1600
02:02:47.68 --> 02:02:56.40
right arm left arm left leg it was it was bad and um I had not had that sappy pleading my

1601
02:02:56.40 --> 02:03:01.92
flat I had been dead there was a big a piece there's a piece sticking out that was bigger than

1602
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:09.20
this cable or sticking out right out of the center and my gunny took pictures of my gear showing guys

1603
02:03:09.20 --> 02:03:19.28
like hey no matter how uncomfortable you are this is why you don't cut corners yeah and um but this

1604
02:03:19.28 --> 02:03:23.68
dude on the litter crew radios up front of the captain he comes back and he yells in my right

1605
02:03:23.68 --> 02:03:32.24
here 12 mics there's a lot of you can 12 minutes and so I was I immediately talked to God again

1606
02:03:32.24 --> 02:03:38.56
right away my a big man I'm gonna have to re-nig on that original verbal agreement

1607
02:03:38.56 --> 02:03:46.96
I'm pretty sure I can do 12 more minutes and um the obviously he gave me that because I'm

1608
02:03:46.96 --> 02:03:53.92
talking to but um we go home we landed in blood which is just to make shit filled hospital at the

1609
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:58.72
time I'm sure you remember from seeing the no four but it was and they pulled me off the bird

1610
02:03:58.72 --> 02:04:06.56
and immediately immediately started working on me I mean it was I would not happy about the situation

1611
02:04:06.56 --> 02:04:11.92
because they kept saying name rank social name rank social name rank social is it wanted me alert

1612
02:04:11.92 --> 02:04:17.12
there where you know and I knew what they were doing and I was like but it's like if you slam

1613
02:04:17.12 --> 02:04:22.64
your finger in the door right and your body is right there and he's like hey are you okay are you okay

1614
02:04:22.64 --> 02:04:28.80
are you okay are you okay and every time they say it the pain goes up like I would be golden

1615
02:04:28.80 --> 02:04:34.000
if you would you shut your yapper you know and so I just yelled finally and pointed with my

1616
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000
right arm who's only it works that hey statuid right to all my ribs I'm done talking

1617
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:48.24
like I'm gonna show them right and I didn't inside and talking to the get me in the tent and

1618
02:04:50.16 --> 02:04:55.20
they they loaded me up with some of the good shit because I felt it definitely helped the pain

1619
02:04:55.20 --> 02:04:59.04
but I was still a massive amount of pain and I'll never forget one of the surgery was slowing

1620
02:04:59.04 --> 02:05:05.04
up my face and he said oops yeah I looked at I was like what do you mean oops doc I mean it's like

1621
02:05:05.04 --> 02:05:10.24
a K-SARM arena picked up on your stitches gonna start again and I said hey doc at this point I have

1622
02:05:10.24 --> 02:05:16.48
the sheet up to my neck I said hey doc I don't know if you've seen seen my body from the neck down

1623
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:22.16
but I'm fairly certain the scratches on my face are the least of our worries and I think you had

1624
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:27.84
the the anesthetist not me out of that moment because I don't that's the last thing I remember

1625
02:05:28.40 --> 02:05:33.20
until I was working up by nurse jacks who she had told me

1626
02:05:33.20 --> 02:05:40.000
she will be up and you know I'm coming out of the OR and um that's still in the lot yeah and she

1627
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.32
says hey marine I'm sorry to tell you this we had to take your right foot it was dead when you

1628
02:05:46.32 --> 02:05:52.72
got here there's no blood flow and it was crushed and I remember thinking to myself like

1629
02:05:53.52 --> 02:05:58.72
shit they took the wrong foot because it was my left one that was really messed up and so then I

1630
02:05:58.72 --> 02:06:05.52
think like you know like it's good enough for government work whatever and I'm just it's

1631
02:06:05.52 --> 02:06:09.68
blood it's I'm just like you know in a long day just got wrong so you're completely

1632
02:06:09.68 --> 02:06:16.88
contorted and twisted in backwards and left foot it was was the one that made it and then

1633
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:22.24
what that looked pretty normal to you look completely normal with my boot on look everything

1634
02:06:22.24 --> 02:06:28.88
normal but then she described it to me she she said when we when you got here imagine

1635
02:06:30.16 --> 02:06:34.32
like a surgical glove but in the shape of a foot as opposed to a hand

1636
02:06:35.12 --> 02:06:41.76
being filled with sand that was your right foot she said everything it was everything and it was

1637
02:06:41.76 --> 02:06:47.76
completely crushed there was it was to the point to where there was it cut off the blood supply

1638
02:06:47.76 --> 02:06:56.000
and so somehow none of my major arteries and my left arm or left leg I hit and so there was still

1639
02:06:57.36 --> 02:07:06.32
hope for my left leg and my left arm but she ended up we ended up loading up on the bird to go to

1640
02:07:06.32 --> 02:07:13.60
Germany and she flew with me to Germany because I was I was not out of the woods by any stretch

1641
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:19.44
it was gonna be a this was gonna be a long and arduous recovery process and I remember getting to

1642
02:07:20.48 --> 02:07:28.88
Germany I don't know I'm sorry but before we left this was four days after I talked to my

1643
02:07:28.88 --> 02:07:37.20
my dad so I called my dad from the sat phone they giving me my dad entered the phone and

1644
02:07:37.20 --> 02:07:46.56
said hey pop and he said why am I talking to you I said they got me so what do you mean they got

1645
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:52.08
me so they got me dad in the murder said how bad are you hurt so they had take my right foot

1646
02:07:53.28 --> 02:07:59.28
there's a pause and then he said are you gonna make it and I said I don't know

1647
02:08:01.12 --> 02:08:05.52
he said we're waiting for a certain green and you know we'll meet you in Germany

1648
02:08:05.52 --> 02:08:13.92
and at this point man I'm not four-year-old kid again just needed that and I

1649
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:18.96
last thing I told him was I was I love them but right then I said please hurry

1650
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:27.04
and he said you're right I love you and love you too that was the hardest one I've ever made in my life

1651
02:08:27.04 --> 02:08:34.96
because I just see him at my actual graduation saying why would you do that and I'm like damn it

1652
02:08:36.56 --> 02:08:42.88
you know damn it you may have had something there like and I'm still thinking like a young

1653
02:08:42.88 --> 02:08:48.80
image your kid but I knew one thing I wanted my dad and so I get to Germany and

1654
02:08:51.60 --> 02:08:55.68
one of my best friends from high school was a little brother who was like my little brother

1655
02:08:55.68 --> 02:09:02.56
growing up was an army and he was a scout and he was there in Germany and was able to get

1656
02:09:02.56 --> 02:09:07.76
word that I was on my way and he was right there and they had been on storage open

1657
02:09:09.28 --> 02:09:14.96
and he put his head on my chest and he lost it it started falling and I just remember

1658
02:09:14.96 --> 02:09:22.08
I'm telling him sorry Josh it's all right man and you know you just kept saying not you not you

1659
02:09:22.08 --> 02:09:28.64
and he wouldn't leave my side you know but he had a cell phone and I got to call other people

1660
02:09:28.64 --> 02:09:34.16
and even there trying to take me to the OR to watch me out and reset my left leg left arm

1661
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:40.56
and redo the external fixators he was like he's walking right next to the bed like he's

1662
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:44.96
going into the OR with me and I remember them saying like so you can't kind of he was like the

1663
02:09:44.96 --> 02:09:50.000
hell I can't what do you and I was like you can't do like just come on man they don't have

1664
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.40
no drugs for both of us so that's but he was it was just a ghost to show you man like it's there

1665
02:09:56.40 --> 02:10:03.44
were so many experiences throughout this process that just reassured me of how very real

1666
02:10:04.64 --> 02:10:11.84
that something bigger than us out there is you know that there I was a believer growing up man

1667
02:10:11.84 --> 02:10:17.52
but this was there were things that happened that no one could explain that had to be

1668
02:10:17.52 --> 02:10:24.64
from our power and that was just one of them one of those moments where I was that was a

1669
02:10:24.64 --> 02:10:30.88
part of me living was Josh being there and me not having to be alone in that situation

1670
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.04
so I ended up leaving Germany and I was only there for you know what even there a full day

1671
02:10:37.04 --> 02:10:44.16
before they send me to Bethesda and I I lent because my family was supposed to meet me a

1672
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:49.92
Germany but the turnaround was so fast that you know the Marines right now we're just gonna send you

1673
02:10:49.92 --> 02:10:57.68
Bethesda and I got to Bethesda and man those flights both flights from my rack of Jeremy

1674
02:10:57.68 --> 02:11:05.52
Germany to Bethesda every little like bit of turbulence every little bump every little movement was

1675
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:11.68
like being blown up all over again it was narlie because your your body was under it was in so much

1676
02:11:11.68 --> 02:11:19.52
pain it was just I'd never puked so much because of pain in my life and it was one of those

1677
02:11:19.52 --> 02:11:26.40
things where I was again every little jar every movement was just like yours human is the

1678
02:11:26.40 --> 02:11:34.16
gum like there's nothing special about yeah this is not gonna get easier and I remember the

1679
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:40.88
getting there and they're waiting over by the inertia entrance and the doors open and of course

1680
02:11:40.88 --> 02:11:45.84
the little yays on it told my family like a jakes on the runway just touched down and my dad

1681
02:11:46.56 --> 02:11:52.88
is there and I'm sure I looked amazing my head was probably size of a watermelon and I was black

1682
02:11:52.88 --> 02:11:58.88
and blue and purple and then I'm sure I smelled amazing too and my dad put his hand on my chest

1683
02:11:58.88 --> 02:12:03.76
and he said Bubba is at you and all I could get out was get your damn hand off my chest because

1684
02:12:03.76 --> 02:12:08.08
all my ribs were broken and it hurt like a wall and he looks at my family because he had

1685
02:12:08.08 --> 02:12:13.52
up that's jake it's jake so they load their they're rolling me on the gurney and this young

1686
02:12:13.52 --> 02:12:20.64
sailors pushing me and I remember every little like in the grout that separates tiles like every

1687
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:25.92
little bump it was like getting blown up again and it would just make it would take my

1688
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:34.24
pan from six to as much as you could think snap of a family and it was gnarly and so I remember

1689
02:12:34.24 --> 02:12:40.96
he's going to push me on the elevator to take me down at ICU and you know the big gap

1690
02:12:40.96 --> 02:12:46.72
the separates the floor and the elevator we goes across that and we're in the big elevator where

1691
02:12:46.72 --> 02:12:50.88
they take the gurney to take the patients on gurney and so my family's in there with us and

1692
02:12:50.88 --> 02:13:01.12
he goes across that bump and this dude is so young and just he was the epitome of a boot

1693
02:13:01.12 --> 02:13:08.16
and so it goes across that gap and I knife hand him with my right hand and I look up and I say

1694
02:13:08.16 --> 02:13:14.48
if you do that again I'm gonna take you out in my dad last and looks at the family like he's

1695
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:22.64
gonna be okay you know and like the dudes meaning to hit gaps right it's just you know the

1696
02:13:22.64 --> 02:13:26.80
problem was as I was never trained to be a severely wounded marine it wasn't in the handbook

1697
02:13:26.80 --> 02:13:33.68
and so I didn't know what the hell to do and let's just get this out of the way I was never a good

1698
02:13:33.68 --> 02:13:44.08
patient ever not one time it was something that I just didn't have in me all I knew to do was to be a

1699
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:51.52
dick and fight like hell and when I fight like hell it's I'm usually a dick that was my survival

1700
02:13:51.52 --> 02:13:57.12
man that was you just like angry were you angry you were hurt and pissed off that you were you're

1701
02:13:57.12 --> 02:14:04.56
like was gone and you're like just pissed and so every nurses you're pissed at I'm not mad

1702
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:09.04
listen I'm not angry that my legs gone I'm not angry I'm angry I'm talking about at that time

1703
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:14.24
at that time I'm not angry that my legs gone I'm not angry I never did the Y me I never

1704
02:14:14.24 --> 02:14:20.000
not want to this day not don't have I don't believe in that I'm angry because my family

1705
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.84
is back in a god forsaken land fighting and there and here I am sucking up oxygen in a hospital

1706
02:14:27.84 --> 02:14:36.88
but that's why I'm angry I'm pissed off at god it's like hey you had a perfectly good chance

1707
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:46.48
perfectly good chance then you what the hell you know what the hell that's I mean what am I supposed

1708
02:14:46.48 --> 02:14:54.72
to do right from here right now what am I doing I'm doing no good none that's why I was angry

1709
02:14:55.68 --> 02:15:02.16
and I was angry because I could not contribute to what I was trained to contribute to with

1710
02:15:02.88 --> 02:15:09.44
with my brothers like that's they were there and I was back home an air condition room with

1711
02:15:09.44 --> 02:15:16.16
a bunch of people waiting on me hand and foot upon totally intended like that you know that's why I was pissed

1712
02:15:17.60 --> 02:15:23.84
no they couldn't understand that yeah and I and I don't blame them for that to this day I don't blame

1713
02:15:23.84 --> 02:15:30.32
them for that but it was you know for we had a lot of guys getting hurt a lot of guys getting wounded

1714
02:15:30.32 --> 02:15:38.80
and I mean the hospital was full of guys I wasn't a different I wasn't special I wasn't any better

1715
02:15:38.80 --> 02:15:45.36
or worse or I was just a guy that had a bad day at work so what are they doing what are you going

1716
02:15:45.36 --> 02:15:51.20
through at this point you know obviously you're going through surgery I mean surgery it was

1717
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:58.72
Narlie yeah I mean it was every for the first two and a half I guess months I was home I was in the

1718
02:15:58.72 --> 02:16:05.76
OR every 48 72 hours and some of those operations were like 18 19 20 hour operations and they're

1719
02:16:05.76 --> 02:16:10.40
piecing you back together yeah man Robert for Peter give the Paul to try and save my left leg

1720
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:15.60
in my left arms and do that and stuff it was crazy crazy crazy how many surgeries you have

1721
02:16:16.08 --> 02:16:22.64
state side at 46 and I had 23 blood transfusions I've had a couple surgeries had a neck surgery

1722
02:16:23.52 --> 02:16:29.84
and I had a hernia surgery so when you get when I got those surgeries right like you just feel

1723
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:35.60
like complete crap it's so you're just going through that every just like almost on a permanent level

1724
02:16:35.60 --> 02:16:45.76
yeah the anesthesia the blood loss all that stuff it just it's wake up suck go to bed repeat

1725
02:16:46.72 --> 02:16:56.48
it was nothing there's nothing fun about any of it and I mean it was so bad that

1726
02:16:58.40 --> 02:17:02.96
it was like the nurses at the nurse they should have the night nurses I'll never forget and it happened

1727
02:17:02.96 --> 02:17:08.88
every night they would do paper rocks this is just you had to take my chart

1728
02:17:11.12 --> 02:17:18.80
it was that bad and I got for a bit of psychologist walkin my god for a bit

1729
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:25.44
it was because I was adding nothing to say to those so I'm kind of I just realized I laughed at this

1730
02:17:25.44 --> 02:17:31.28
right and we're in your telling it in a funny way because you're like hey I was a bad patient

1731
02:17:31.28 --> 02:17:36.48
but at the point I was getting that before like why you were angry but you like we're laughing

1732
02:17:36.48 --> 02:17:42.24
about it right now but you're not kidding like this like you were p***ing pissed right yeah

1733
02:17:42.24 --> 02:17:45.84
and when someone come in you'd be like you don't get that off me I don't know if you don't

1734
02:17:45.84 --> 02:17:52.32
what you got like just aggro with people so I had this this is the rule that I had as a patient

1735
02:17:53.36 --> 02:17:59.28
you're not allowed in my room unless we share DNA or your United States Marine

1736
02:17:59.28 --> 02:18:05.52
and that goes for the president on down I don't give a shit what your title is or who you are

1737
02:18:05.52 --> 02:18:10.24
those are the rules if you don't have the same DNA as me and your United States Marine don't

1738
02:18:10.24 --> 02:18:15.92
come in my room because I'm gonna let you know you're not allowed and that was because I'm

1739
02:18:15.92 --> 02:18:21.76
in survival mode and survival mode I didn't know what that looked like while I was making it up as

1740
02:18:21.76 --> 02:18:27.60
I got as I went and I mean it was didn't matter what surgeon was talking to me what professional

1741
02:18:27.60 --> 02:18:33.52
with a bunch of letters after his or her name I didn't care I did not care because my mind

1742
02:18:33.52 --> 02:18:42.48
said was like I'm trying to figure out how to get to the next breath in the least painful ways

1743
02:18:42.48 --> 02:18:51.76
possible and it was something that it was like I said I went from being one of the most

1744
02:18:51.76 --> 02:18:56.80
part of one of the most elite fighting forces known to mankind to not being able to use

1745
02:18:56.80 --> 02:19:03.68
the bathroom on my own now is in a hospital bed for months overnight I mean it the drop of a hat

1746
02:19:04.96 --> 02:19:09.92
that's not homo pie that's in hell in the factory knowing that my guys I knew

1747
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:16.96
Felusio we were already drawing the war plan for Felusio and so it's like here I am

1748
02:19:19.44 --> 02:19:24.000
and not broken I hate that terminology but here I am completely fractured

1749
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:34.56
and these guys are hooking in jab and they're asking me what kind of what color Jello I want

1750
02:19:36.72 --> 02:19:43.84
and it's like I don't need I don't need to eat I need to get through the next minute

1751
02:19:45.44 --> 02:19:52.56
and then the minute after that I get nothing else matters nothing I just need to survive

1752
02:19:52.56 --> 02:20:01.68
second by second minute my minute breath by breath and continue to believe I'm worth this thing

1753
02:20:01.68 --> 02:20:08.48
called life I need to keep fighting and a byproduct of that is that I was a giant dick

1754
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.72
but I kept fighting it wasn't pretty but I kept fighting and how long were you in Bethesda

1755
02:20:16.72 --> 02:20:25.52
four so I'm only Bethesda a few months and then they moved me not in fact my my dad goes to

1756
02:20:25.52 --> 02:20:34.80
Walter Reed and then he comes back and he says yo Jake this is your deal and let me back up a bit

1757
02:20:35.52 --> 02:20:40.32
my dad and my brother are both pretty squeamish like when it comes to blood and stuff like that

1758
02:20:40.32 --> 02:20:47.52
I just don't do well with it my dad who was an executive manager, just retired last year an executive

1759
02:20:47.52 --> 02:20:56.16
banker started as a window teller to bang it worked his way up did not leave my bedside for 62 days

1760
02:20:58.72 --> 02:21:05.84
didn't leave my side no matter how hard I was on him or did they did not leave my side

1761
02:21:05.84 --> 02:21:12.64
and I like to say that if I had it not been for this explosion I would not be nearly as close to my

1762
02:21:12.64 --> 02:21:18.48
you can't I don't think I could possibly be closer to my dad as I am now or my brother

1763
02:21:19.28 --> 02:21:27.20
same thing same relationship that before just didn't we just didn't have it and I think it was

1764
02:21:27.20 --> 02:21:32.48
because there was always that office struggle where is it had to take one of the office

1765
02:21:32.48 --> 02:21:39.28
having a thumb over the grim reaper for everyone to say what the hell are we doing

1766
02:21:40.88 --> 02:21:47.04
and why are we doing it and that's why I just wanted the reasons I wouldn't trade it

1767
02:21:48.24 --> 02:21:52.48
because that that's beautiful man and I got to experience something that a lot of people don't

1768
02:21:52.48 --> 02:21:58.40
get to experience that they die wondering that I said everything I needed to say

1769
02:21:58.40 --> 02:22:04.000
that I love as hard as I needed to love I don't have to wonder about that now

1770
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.24
I needed to the loving beloved everything else is filler

1771
02:22:10.48 --> 02:22:16.88
so that's why I would not trade it but I remember my dad taught me with my left arm one night they

1772
02:22:17.92 --> 02:22:21.52
they were telling me okay Jake you know we have this we have to re-construct your left arm and

1773
02:22:22.32 --> 02:22:27.76
the bottom graph took the first time but the top graph didn't take and the second time they tried

1774
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:34.08
doing it I remember they I woke up all they were cutting the graphed off and that was an

1775
02:22:34.08 --> 02:22:38.80
early experience but I was a week for like literally 0.5 seconds before they knocked me back out

1776
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.84
and did you hit anybody in that 0.5 seconds I tried to hit people all the time I think it was

1777
02:22:45.84 --> 02:22:51.60
stupid I mean I messed up stitches and staples and stuff all the time and I took up my

1778
02:22:51.60 --> 02:22:59.60
own out all the time I broke up drugged up for you during this time dude I was on enough drugs to

1779
02:22:59.60 --> 02:23:04.80
like kill a herd of elephants because everybody's body reacts differently to drugs right

1780
02:23:04.80 --> 02:23:09.28
either you they accept them and you didn't take a lot with mine fights everything

1781
02:23:10.40 --> 02:23:17.20
you know I mean which is not surprising but it takes if it takes you or you one pill it's going to take me

1782
02:23:17.20 --> 02:23:24.08
five and so every operation I had because these were major these were intrusive operations these

1783
02:23:24.08 --> 02:23:32.40
weren't okay we're gonna go and take the staples out of the no these were we're going in

1784
02:23:32.40 --> 02:23:37.60
cutting you back up and we're gonna power wash this part of your body out and that mean they were

1785
02:23:37.60 --> 02:23:42.64
intrusive operations we're gonna go and take skin from this part of your body and put it on this

1786
02:23:42.64 --> 02:23:47.60
other part of your body and so or we're gonna take this bone out here and we're gonna try and

1787
02:23:47.60 --> 02:23:55.76
graft it over there and so it was one of those things where I knew like okay these are some

1788
02:23:55.76 --> 02:24:01.52
serious things where for six months to a year like I didn't know if I was gonna keep my left

1789
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:06.24
leg on my left arm because they they were I was going through all these operations to save these

1790
02:24:06.24 --> 02:24:12.96
two appendages that were and for all its purposes I was a guinea pig for a lot of stuff which I'm

1791
02:24:12.96 --> 02:24:18.64
okay with was better me than my brothers I'm alright with that small price to pay would be one of

1792
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:27.60
the world's finest right and so they I remember the night before I had this major operation on my

1793
02:24:27.60 --> 02:24:34.32
left arm and this was when the graft didn't take the second one and they were doing a bone graft

1794
02:24:34.32 --> 02:24:39.36
and they ampute it in my right leg again to take some of the tibia from my right leg to try and

1795
02:24:39.36 --> 02:24:46.000
graft it in my left arm because five inches of my old on my left arm was bone out and my

1796
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.24
dad asked the doc on there for get it he said hey doc how did you sleep the next morning

1797
02:24:52.24 --> 02:24:58.24
and he said I didn't my dad's a lot one in sleep so it's because I did Jake's operation

1798
02:24:58.24 --> 02:25:05.36
about a thousand times in my head my dad was like okay I think I'm okay with that and then

1799
02:25:07.20 --> 02:25:13.44
I remember masking me a a chick do you you mind if we ampute your fourth digit on your left

1800
02:25:13.44 --> 02:25:17.84
hand because I don't think it's gonna be of any use to you and because my medical

1801
02:25:17.84 --> 02:25:21.92
elbow was blown out from my ring finger I said if I wake up and there's anything else cut off

1802
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:25.60
my body don't be on the right side of my back because I will choke you out from a guy

1803
02:25:25.60 --> 02:25:33.68
and everybody and he being knowing me all too well at the time said alright I'm gonna take

1804
02:25:33.68 --> 02:25:39.52
that as a know and everybody got a good laugh and then they knocked me out again you know but

1805
02:25:40.88 --> 02:25:48.08
so that graft didn't take and they knocked me back out then they call on a specialist and so

1806
02:25:48.08 --> 02:25:57.04
what they had to do was put me in a douce coma and cut my abdomen open and then put my left arm

1807
02:25:57.04 --> 02:26:04.72
in my abdomen and then sold my abdomen shut to grow skin over my left arm so much

1808
02:26:04.72 --> 02:26:10.88
interestingly the same Lou Paul or Junior had the same because he had severely got his hands

1809
02:26:10.88 --> 02:26:15.28
jacked up and they did the same thing multiple times to him yeah and it's you know who to

1810
02:26:15.28 --> 02:26:20.56
thought that's a thing you know and then they so my dad and I had this thing where I would wake

1811
02:26:20.56 --> 02:26:25.76
up every morning because he was always there during the day then someone else had come at night

1812
02:26:26.88 --> 02:26:34.40
and so I would say you know he'd add it's you know Monday April 16th whatever and

1813
02:26:35.12 --> 02:26:43.44
just to make sure I still had somewhat reliable cognitive function function going on you know and I'm

1814
02:26:43.44 --> 02:26:48.64
trying to exercise my frontal loaves as much as I can making sure these executive functions are

1815
02:26:48.64 --> 02:26:53.04
still working the way they are because I was already told you've got post for my stress track

1816
02:26:53.04 --> 02:26:58.88
brandry which I was like whatever you know that's made up stuff by people in white goats

1817
02:26:58.88 --> 02:27:06.000
too much time on their hands that do will not affect me I'm I'm I'm ready no and

1818
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:18.72
so I'm coming out of this this coma and that was the first time that my brother came in for the

1819
02:27:18.72 --> 02:27:27.20
first time and I remember he came in and I could see because what sucked was as early on

1820
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:32.000
in the induced coma like I could be a alert but I couldn't obviously could say things I was

1821
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:39.28
animated so I did machine breathing for me I was completely paralyzed from the neck down couldn't move anything

1822
02:27:40.48 --> 02:27:46.000
and it only lasted for the only did it for a day or so because it was so gnarly that my

1823
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.84
BP and everything would freak out my blood pressure would go up and I would see someone in my family

1824
02:27:49.84 --> 02:27:54.56
because I felt like I was trapped in my own I'm a prisoner of my body somebody get me the hell out

1825
02:27:54.56 --> 02:27:59.76
so where does the induced coma you can't move and can't talk nothing and yet you're conscious

1826
02:27:59.76 --> 02:28:06.16
yeah isn't the purpose of being an induced coma right so unconscious right so they they this

1827
02:28:06.16 --> 02:28:13.36
is just prior to them inducing the coma okay and so it was just before it but then my brother

1828
02:28:13.36 --> 02:28:18.56
came in and it was the first time that my brother had been able to see me using college at the time

1829
02:28:18.56 --> 02:28:24.000
and playing ball and my brother came in and sat down on the chair so well first when he goes to

1830
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.24
the walk in and I see him coming the door and they I see you and he leaves he like took a half step in

1831
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:36.80
and he turned around and he bolted and this is the queeziness factor no I think this was no I think

1832
02:28:36.80 --> 02:28:42.80
it for him it was an emotion he didn't want to be emotional and me know he was emotional which

1833
02:28:42.80 --> 02:28:47.60
I knew it did exactly why I had to leave the room so it's like it's obsolete my brother come all the way

1834
02:28:47.60 --> 02:28:55.84
in I know you're doing and so with it he comes back in he sits down on the chair on the right

1835
02:28:55.84 --> 02:29:01.92
side of my bed and he grabs my right hand and he puts his his forehead on my hand and he just

1836
02:29:01.92 --> 02:29:06.96
starts crying and he just starts repeating over and over again thank you for not dying thank you for

1837
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:14.24
not dying and I was like dude anytime you want to shut up about that like it would be awesome

1838
02:29:14.24 --> 02:29:20.08
because it was getting I mean it was getting to me right so my BP started going up and they're like

1839
02:29:20.08 --> 02:29:25.28
hey you got to leave like you can't stay in here so then they realized like okay we got to

1840
02:29:25.28 --> 02:29:29.92
we got an Aquaman out and then because they tried taping the window so I couldn't see but then

1841
02:29:29.92 --> 02:29:34.64
it just was too much so they that's when they completely put me in the common

1842
02:29:35.84 --> 02:29:41.92
that was for like 30 days or something and I remember coming out of it and telling my

1843
02:29:41.92 --> 02:29:47.76
dad like induced coma was for 30 days yeah oh yeah it's a girl that around my arm and

1844
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:55.84
so they cut it out and then it took thankfully that was the last resort for my left arm

1845
02:29:55.84 --> 02:30:00.88
so that intake they're gonna have to empty below my hollow within my dead weeks or I

1846
02:30:00.88 --> 02:30:05.76
weakened I'm coming out and looking my dad my dad's money April 16 because I was like well no it's

1847
02:30:05.76 --> 02:30:13.52
uh what was happened was and then I'm like did no one want to run this by me it was like no they

1848
02:30:13.52 --> 02:30:21.60
figured you'd be against it so it's like whatever shit just a little matab you know it's like

1849
02:30:22.64 --> 02:30:27.76
but I remember my dad going over water easy it was time my dad told them like hey listen

1850
02:30:27.76 --> 02:30:32.40
I can afford to fly up here and see my son every week most of his family because I'm still

1851
02:30:32.40 --> 02:30:36.96
not out of the woods most of his family can't afford to come to Maryland from Louisiana and

1852
02:30:36.96 --> 02:30:43.92
her Texas to come you know see him often and so he goes to Walter Reed and just came back and he told

1853
02:30:43.92 --> 02:30:50.40
me he said but this is your deal this is but no son of mine is gonna go to that hospital

1854
02:30:51.44 --> 02:30:56.16
I'm obviously I'm gonna take your word for it's not like I can skip over there and go check it out

1855
02:30:56.16 --> 02:31:03.68
and they said okay well we had a friend that worked with a pinagon it was a one star and my dad

1856
02:31:03.68 --> 02:31:08.72
my stem on the contact them and just said hey listen we gotta get J close for the home and so I

1857
02:31:08.72 --> 02:31:18.08
actually went to they sent me to BAMSI and San Antonio and I like to say that's accounts for 50

1858
02:31:18.08 --> 02:31:23.36
percent of my post from that stress because I was the only marine at army facility and sorry I'm not

1859
02:31:23.36 --> 02:31:29.44
sorry about that but it was a great hospital that you know they did just a good work as Bethesda

1860
02:31:30.88 --> 02:31:36.72
you know but when they when they shipped me they moved me way too soon and I just my body wasn't

1861
02:31:36.72 --> 02:31:41.84
ready for it and we had to stop and I believe it's called Scott Air Force Base in Illinois

1862
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:51.52
reflying yeah I'm a bird so he stopped and Scott and um I guess we didn't know that we were stopping

1863
02:31:51.52 --> 02:32:01.04
and I had only had enough enough medications in my nerve blockers for set amount of time to get

1864
02:32:01.04 --> 02:32:09.36
to San Antonio well that stuff was they wanted to do a little layover yeah so I'm pissed

1865
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:16.24
I wake up when we're there and this guanyu walks up to me he was like hey cool for sure you can

1866
02:32:16.24 --> 02:32:25.52
welcome with Scott Air Force Base I'm guanyu shmucketelli and I was I'm like where the hell

1867
02:32:25.52 --> 02:32:32.64
Scott Air Force Base and who the hell are you? because my my tactic at this point is gone way

1868
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:40.16
out the window did not matter your rank like did not matter and because I'm on a tip point where I'm

1869
02:32:40.16 --> 02:32:46.48
like what are they gonna do shape my hands I mean all right please you'd be doing me a favor but

1870
02:32:46.48 --> 02:32:52.80
the sun pissed and I call my dad and I'm like I don't know who fucked this up but I need you

1871
02:32:52.80 --> 02:32:58.56
on fuck it right now and he got pissed that I was pissed and him some was out of his control you know

1872
02:32:58.56 --> 02:33:04.24
and he was like Jake home and fine go back to go back to the test I don't care but you know and it was

1873
02:33:04.24 --> 02:33:12.64
you know I I I was owed that in a lot more and so they gave me the hospital my buddy just

1874
02:33:12.64 --> 02:33:17.92
started shut down so next week this is in the hospital Scott it's just you okay this is not like a

1875
02:33:17.92 --> 02:33:24.56
major so they did like a legit let they stopped stopped like so then it's a delay for me to even

1876
02:33:24.56 --> 02:33:31.44
go to Santonio because they had to get you to recover kind of yeah so that series of events happens

1877
02:33:31.44 --> 02:33:40.16
there which was crazy so I go into this shock effect where you know I'm unconscious and uh this is

1878
02:33:40.16 --> 02:33:47.12
another one of those moments where the higher power thing I'm coming out of it and uh my left

1879
02:33:47.12 --> 02:33:55.92
head my head's turned to my left and the door to my room opens I knew whoever was about to walk

1880
02:33:55.92 --> 02:34:04.24
in the door like I just felt like a a spiritual presence like I just felt I knew whoever that was

1881
02:34:04.24 --> 02:34:10.08
was a person of faith like personally got knew it knew no doubt about it felt it when the door

1882
02:34:10.08 --> 02:34:16.24
opened the dude comes around the corner and introduce himself and it's the base chaplain

1883
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:26.80
and I was like okay well that's that and he said hey I'm I'm chaplain so I said I knew I knew

1884
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:35.36
before you even for our saw you so it was the door open like I felt I felt the presence of the

1885
02:34:35.36 --> 02:34:42.72
higher being like I felt it I knew it and I get this really like he you could tell he was

1886
02:34:42.72 --> 02:34:47.44
moved by it you know I wouldn't say it to both smoke up as I asked I just knew the dude was a man

1887
02:34:47.44 --> 02:34:54.40
of God and I mean it again can't explain it so the whole thing the whole word faith comes in

1888
02:34:54.40 --> 02:35:01.68
look it up sometime yeah you'd love it but the um so then he walks in and start talking to me so

1889
02:35:01.68 --> 02:35:07.84
we have this long conversation of which I can't remember most of that's the next day is when I'm leaving

1890
02:35:07.84 --> 02:35:15.20
and he brings his whole family head like four or five kids and his we brought his wife

1891
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:24.08
and all the nurses and I mean the airmen and the reserve Marines and army guys like made this

1892
02:35:25.36 --> 02:35:32.80
lying on either side of the back towards at the bird and it was like I don't rate what you

1893
02:35:32.80 --> 02:35:38.48
guys are doing but appreciate it like I can dig it right but I didn't I was just thinking like

1894
02:35:40.24 --> 02:35:47.04
it's a little much but thank you you know and that was what it was like you know who the

1895
02:35:47.04 --> 02:35:54.56
hell I'm on to take away from there right to honor their brother and like you know who am I to do that

1896
02:35:54.56 --> 02:36:02.88
there's just showing love all the way not halfway and so of course me being me at the time

1897
02:36:02.88 --> 02:36:07.84
I didn't look at it that way I was just like I'm naked in front of everyone type feeling

1898
02:36:07.84 --> 02:36:13.60
I'm just uncomfortable right now and so they they blowed me up and we fly from um Scott to

1899
02:36:14.96 --> 02:36:21.68
we're going to Bamsi and we stop over and oh it was it was all past so

1900
02:36:21.68 --> 02:36:28.64
and on the way I can see the load master mouth to one of the other one of the other crewman

1901
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:37.20
we're about to fly around a tornado I read his lips and I'm like hey god like come on man

1902
02:36:37.76 --> 02:36:43.28
throw a dude a bone like we're about I'm gonna survive all the stuff I've survived and if you let me

1903
02:36:43.28 --> 02:36:51.04
get taken out by a tornado like we're gonna be fighting this bullshit but I'm just thinking like

1904
02:36:51.92 --> 02:36:58.80
Murphy back off bro just back off but it's just this these little moments where you find light

1905
02:36:58.80 --> 02:37:04.08
and these heavy situations and I didn't know that we were stopping in all past so we stopped

1906
02:37:04.08 --> 02:37:08.24
in all past on our pissed why are we stopping and why aren't we in San Antonio?

1907
02:37:08.24 --> 02:37:14.40
Well because we had to drop off someone who was gay I ain't in there should return in the

1908
02:37:14.40 --> 02:37:23.04
body and I was like okay I'm a major dick like get it you know it was like shit could you

1909
02:37:23.04 --> 02:37:27.76
told me that and they probably did tell me but I'm on so many drugs I'm gonna remember about

1910
02:37:27.76 --> 02:37:33.92
point two seconds of an hour conversation I had with you so we get to San Antonio again my body

1911
02:37:33.92 --> 02:37:39.68
was bad and me my body's good does the same thing it did it Scott and next thing I know I'm in the

1912
02:37:39.68 --> 02:37:52.48
ICU again and now the OR and I end up doing 15 months in in BAMPSY and man every operation it was

1913
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:57.60
just more drugs more drugs more drugs more drugs the series of events happens at BAMPSY I'm the

1914
02:37:57.60 --> 02:38:04.000
only marine there which I stated and it was bad because I mean you can only call a marine

1915
02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.76
soldier so many times before I'm gonna let you know that that bothers me and if I wanted to be

1916
02:38:09.76 --> 02:38:14.32
a soldier I would have joined the freaking army stop calling me a soldier let's just the marine

1917
02:38:14.32 --> 02:38:22.08
thing it's a pride thing absolutely a freaking pride thing if you don't like it would you

1918
02:38:22.08 --> 02:38:29.60
call trusty pull a soldier because if you would you're ignorant and my thing was is like just

1919
02:38:29.60 --> 02:38:36.24
you'd allow some tact and so they ended up putting the the EGA the Marine Corps seal on my door

1920
02:38:37.28 --> 02:38:46.56
and let just to let people know yeah same rules though you don't share my DNA and I know I say

1921
02:38:46.56 --> 02:38:54.40
this marine don't come in my room still so I didn't meet I missed I missed out on meeting a lot

1922
02:38:54.40 --> 02:39:01.20
of quote unquote famous people and and politicians that I'm sure they're because they care and

1923
02:39:02.16 --> 02:39:06.88
a bunch of other people and it was because of that rule and then the secretary of the army

1924
02:39:07.84 --> 02:39:12.64
or the surgeon general once started surgery was coming and they were like horrible

1925
02:39:12.64 --> 02:39:18.16
trick we really you know we need you to wake up and shave and you're gonna come see the

1926
02:39:18.16 --> 02:39:27.60
surgeon general and I was like okay yeah I'm gonna do that obviously I didn't and so I have

1927
02:39:27.60 --> 02:39:32.000
people coming out to my room and they're like couple sheck this surgeon general's downstairs

1928
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.44
you were supposed to be in your electrical wheelchair down there meeting them and I'm like what

1929
02:39:35.44 --> 02:39:41.20
part of my face has I give a shit that they're here I don't even know if it's a man or woman

1930
02:39:41.20 --> 02:39:50.08
I don't care if they want to see me you know where my room is do I go to his or her office

1931
02:39:50.96 --> 02:39:57.68
and say hey I'm gonna need you downstairs because I'm coming no no I don't there are

1932
02:39:57.68 --> 02:40:02.56
persons just like me except they probably some tell you that pain levels probably not where mine

1933
02:40:02.56 --> 02:40:09.92
is right now and no I'm not gonna shave either so you can just just eat a whole bag of

1934
02:40:09.92 --> 02:40:18.000
dicks because I don't care and so again great patient really really good patient so you're

1935
02:40:18.88 --> 02:40:23.52
the drugs at this point that they're putting you on mass all kind of pain killers and

1936
02:40:25.68 --> 02:40:31.04
do you even is there any point where you start realizing like oh I'm not gonna be okay

1937
02:40:31.04 --> 02:40:36.64
without these things I want them all the time not once so at this point no so you're just thinking

1938
02:40:36.64 --> 02:40:39.04
that's just the way it is yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1939
02:40:39.04 --> 02:40:44.16
I'm badly wounded I need paint killers part of the game yeah right part of the game and so

1940
02:40:44.16 --> 02:40:52.32
at this point I'm thinking I have this is probably operation like 35 36 and it's so bad that they

1941
02:40:52.32 --> 02:40:58.32
have me now I'm having a recover in the ICU after every operation because they have an monitor

1942
02:40:59.04 --> 02:41:04.48
my breathing in my heart rate because I'm on so many drugs and so at this point they've given me

1943
02:41:04.48 --> 02:41:11.68
what they feel like okay we cannot just give them more of any we can't give them more to

1944
02:41:11.68 --> 02:41:17.68
a lot of them are all are fentanyl or etc etc so they give me this is the first time that I had

1945
02:41:17.68 --> 02:41:28.000
experience after one of these operations ketamine and I was such a bad because the guy

1946
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:35.84
comes in to started ministering the ketamine and I'll never forget this and he goes he starts to

1947
02:41:35.84 --> 02:41:42.48
minister through my one of my V come into my pickle on and he says that you fill it yet

1948
02:41:43.28 --> 02:41:49.76
like nope keep pushing fill it yet no I started to fill it the second time he asked what I was like

1949
02:41:49.76 --> 02:41:59.12
nope it's like oh all right fill the nope nothing this time I definitely fill it but I'm

1950
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:05.52
lying because again if one pill is good I bet you tens awesome my mind said right so the fourth time

1951
02:42:05.52 --> 02:42:10.88
he asked me I might oh yeah all right my fill it and he was like okay because I just I don't think

1952
02:42:10.88 --> 02:42:16.24
I've ever given any not much but they say your tolerance is really really high so you know what is

1953
02:42:16.24 --> 02:42:22.80
well I mean I started I mean the door didn't even shut all the way and I started hallucinating my balls off

1954
02:42:22.80 --> 02:42:29.76
I'm on so much ketamine you know the street apparently street terminology for a special K

1955
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:39.76
and I didn't even know like that was the thing and it was it was Narlie I mean I was seeing

1956
02:42:39.76 --> 02:42:47.52
things that weren't there I was it was bad and I came out of that and I told my

1957
02:42:47.52 --> 02:42:52.08
leaves physician that came I said don't ever I don't want that stuff anymore like that was not

1958
02:42:52.48 --> 02:42:57.60
like that was not a cool high like it was bad I don't like it and there I go we're gonna

1959
02:42:57.60 --> 02:43:02.48
have to put you back in the ice y'all's like I do not care I'll live in the ice you it's not like I'm

1960
02:43:02.48 --> 02:43:08.72
in the rits okay if I'm in the ice you I'm in this room with four other dude like it doesn't matter

1961
02:43:08.72 --> 02:43:17.52
whatever right and um obviously I developed a development of a reputation at BAMC and

1962
02:43:19.04 --> 02:43:25.20
I'm attached to four three condoms there at the time and it's right out right by BAMC

1963
02:43:25.84 --> 02:43:32.32
and there's one marine there that the day I got there he was right there and he was a staff

1964
02:43:32.32 --> 02:43:40.08
sort of at the time and he told me when I got there he'd brother I'm gonna come see you every day

1965
02:43:40.08 --> 02:43:46.24
in this with you well so did the I don't remember if he was the first one or a star major at the time

1966
02:43:47.12 --> 02:43:52.64
said the same thing well there's a lot of cameras there you know seeing it in fox and crap because

1967
02:43:52.64 --> 02:43:58.56
I'm you know the only marine or facility got some attention and so that guy says the same thing

1968
02:43:58.56 --> 02:44:05.92
well I didn't see him again but the the first guy the staffs are every day man every day

1969
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:12.08
and he started like he would walk in and like tickle where my right foot should be and it

1970
02:44:12.08 --> 02:44:15.68
would tick it was crazy because it would tickle and it would not be like that come on bro

1971
02:44:16.72 --> 02:44:21.60
and he would he would just laugh and laugh he thought it was the best thing ever and it was just

1972
02:44:21.60 --> 02:44:28.88
those little moments though those little nuances of time that would light make me forget that I was

1973
02:44:28.88 --> 02:44:38.88
who I was and I was in the situation I was in that would make me realize you know if if I think

1974
02:44:38.88 --> 02:44:46.40
it's that bad I would get when I was able to get mobile I remember actually that was an isolation

1975
02:44:46.40 --> 02:44:55.44
when I showed up who's the second marine at Banssey and they told me hey there's another marine

1976
02:44:55.44 --> 02:45:02.80
on deck just he's getting he just got here but then I'm thinking he's gonna make it my side I

1977
02:45:02.80 --> 02:45:08.000
need to see I need to go see him right now like while you're in isolation I do not give a shit

1978
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.32
I'm gonna go see him right now or you're gonna have to kill me it's all the way I'm not seeing them

1979
02:45:12.32 --> 02:45:21.60
so they're like okay and they get the little human train and train me up and put me in my

1980
02:45:21.60 --> 02:45:26.64
black electrical church all the my black had a black thing was legit they took it from me though

1981
02:45:26.64 --> 02:45:32.96
I put one too many holes in the walls of the don't drive your electric wheelchair

1982
02:45:32.96 --> 02:45:43.36
and heavily medicated folks that's it but I go see Ty do you why right I want those to

1983
02:45:44.48 --> 02:45:52.16
believe it or not I got one of those and but I go see Ty mind you this time at this point

1984
02:45:52.80 --> 02:45:58.72
I still haven't gotten like emotional one time like it's since I left

1985
02:45:58.72 --> 02:46:04.96
do love like I haven't gotten emotional from my family or otherwise still pretty

1986
02:46:04.96 --> 02:46:10.88
squared away with the emhole emotion thing I go see Ty and I go into his room and he's

1987
02:46:11.92 --> 02:46:18.88
completely wrapped up I mean the front half of his cranium was blown off I mean it was

1988
02:46:19.44 --> 02:46:26.96
he was blind one I severely burned I mean bad I mean look like a mommy when I saw him

1989
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:36.32
no ears were burned off eyelids nose lips and I remember I had to yell at his nurse who's

1990
02:46:36.32 --> 02:46:43.36
just giant black dude just giant black harming guy and I had to yell at him who had to then

1991
02:46:43.36 --> 02:46:51.36
lean down and yell in the side of Ty's head so he could know what was going on and I just told

1992
02:46:51.36 --> 02:46:55.52
him that told the nurse my guy and there's like hey brother I just want to come see my family

1993
02:46:55.52 --> 02:47:02.000
because I heard another Marine was on deck and I was like right on and now we can take over this

1994
02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:12.40
hospital and so I leaned down he said hey Ty another Marine and Ty like put up his is not like

1995
02:47:12.40 --> 02:47:19.20
oh yeah Marines and and Ty whispered to the nurse and he said he wants to know like what are your

1996
02:47:19.20 --> 02:47:25.92
injuries and I told him you know told him my injuries and uh started of course with you know

1997
02:47:25.92 --> 02:47:31.68
a lost right leg didn't lose it you know he said I know where I went but told started with that

1998
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:36.24
and he was whist he was telling Ty as I'm telling the injuries and it's seen as a

1999
02:47:36.24 --> 02:47:41.92
sin lost right leg like Ty holds up his right leg like still got mine was it down

2000
02:47:42.80 --> 02:47:48.000
and the left leg got banged up Bob I'm Ty holds up his left leg and it was like doing this

2001
02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:58.08
typical typical Marine banter right there considering the conditions we're in yet we're just

2002
02:47:58.08 --> 02:48:04.56
gonna smoke and joke because that's what family does to get through the arc time you got to find

2003
02:48:04.56 --> 02:48:11.36
light and regardless of how dark the situation is because if you don't they will kill you

2004
02:48:11.36 --> 02:48:19.12
but I remember having this interaction with Ty and I left the room and I'm facing the

2005
02:48:19.12 --> 02:48:26.08
nurse's station when I come out in the door shuts and I just completely and utterly broke down

2006
02:48:27.68 --> 02:48:33.84
to the point of anger like I was I was sobbing in the angry I was so angry

2007
02:48:33.84 --> 02:48:42.56
seeing him that way and seeing and I just like just yell like those bastards like what you know

2008
02:48:42.56 --> 02:48:50.32
what why what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing what are we gonna do about that

2009
02:48:51.28 --> 02:48:59.04
and it piss me off not only because here I see my brother that is never ever ever gonna be remotely

2010
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:09.04
the same as he ever was before but then it reminded me in a very abrupt manner who the hell are you

2011
02:49:10.96 --> 02:49:19.68
to be acting the way you're acting because they're telling his family you better call

2012
02:49:19.68 --> 02:49:24.08
anyone who wants to tell him goodbye because he's probably not gonna make it through the next 48 hours

2013
02:49:24.08 --> 02:49:33.52
and here I was acting like a complete asset very much alive not having they weren't having to

2014
02:49:33.52 --> 02:49:38.48
call anyone of my family or any of my friends because I was gonna make it at this point I'm gonna

2015
02:49:38.48 --> 02:49:48.96
make it and that reminded me of it's not about you you just thought it was about you it's not about you

2016
02:49:48.96 --> 02:50:00.48
and then that that one interaction taught me right then okay I need to go see every wounded person

2017
02:50:00.48 --> 02:50:08.96
in this hospital as often as I can because that's where I found healing so that's what I did

2018
02:50:08.96 --> 02:50:16.40
I saw every wounded person talked to all their families and that is when I realized that

2019
02:50:16.40 --> 02:50:22.96
gather there's really something of the service of yourself because not only does it feed my

2020
02:50:22.96 --> 02:50:38.08
soul it feeds theirs it's mutually beneficial and I learned if you're not willing to use

2021
02:50:38.08 --> 02:50:47.44
whatever platform you find yourself in and to make yourself 100% vulnerable for whatever make um you

2022
02:50:47.44 --> 02:50:53.52
will never make a difference you're waking up and choosing to be status quo

2023
02:50:55.76 --> 02:51:04.64
and choosing to be average and I learned right then the great the great ones the ones that the

2024
02:51:04.64 --> 02:51:11.12
history books are gonna rave about and that do rave about were consistently uncomfortable

2025
02:51:12.80 --> 02:51:21.84
and consistently vulnerable and that was a great lesson for me to learn and I didn't make

2026
02:51:21.84 --> 02:51:30.08
me any better than anyone else it just made me more susceptible to judgment which already had a

2027
02:51:30.08 --> 02:51:38.08
ton of so I didn't care but I remember being and thinking about this pride of being a

2028
02:51:38.08 --> 02:51:45.12
United States Marine and representing what that means and thinking about gunny you know the salty gunny

2029
02:51:46.24 --> 02:51:52.64
back in Iraq and thinking how would he behave how would he react how would what would he do

2030
02:51:52.64 --> 02:52:00.32
same thing about first order and I'm actually let's back up back to I'm gonna give an example of what

2031
02:52:00.32 --> 02:52:07.92
being tribal truly means that you can't buy so I'm back into fes that my dad tells me

2032
02:52:07.92 --> 02:52:16.16
hey Jake first order and greens gonna come see you and I remember thinking shit he's I'm sure he's

2033
02:52:16.16 --> 02:52:23.28
pissed because I got hit and he's probably just gonna finish the job so I was terrified right I'm

2034
02:52:23.28 --> 02:52:30.000
terrified because I I'm not only do I respect this man to the end to agree but I love this man

2035
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:38.000
and I was like I don't want to experience what I'm about to have to experience I'd rather

2036
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.96
take the cowards way out so I was like I'm sure I could like I'm I'm passed out when he walks in

2037
02:52:42.96 --> 02:52:51.20
I'm on a lot of drugs that'll work so I hear not call the door I'm like here the door open

2038
02:52:52.08 --> 02:52:56.24
I'm dead say you're getting your first one hurry at first horse walks in so I'm like

2039
02:52:56.24 --> 02:53:02.96
I gotta pass out as soon as you bust the hatch and walks in my freaking heart monitor dime

2040
02:53:02.96 --> 02:53:09.84
is me out because it goes from like the slow steady beep to the the rapid beep and I'm like

2041
02:53:09.84 --> 02:53:15.84
I'm up there obviously this isn't gonna work and there is no plan to be I'm awake and he

2042
02:53:15.84 --> 02:53:24.64
looks at my family I'm in my dad's in there my mom my step mom my aunt my cousins my brother

2043
02:53:24.64 --> 02:53:32.88
my sister and my and he says hey Mr. guy you doing he's got that raspy voice I don't

2044
02:53:32.88 --> 02:53:38.48
imagine being on the drill field as long as he was the help and he said we're doing our

2045
02:53:38.48 --> 02:53:43.36
hanging in there first son he said it could go could go hey you want to have him in with my brother

2046
02:53:43.36 --> 02:53:49.76
my dad was like sure you know go ahead first order like he was gonna turn around come talk to me

2047
02:53:49.76 --> 02:53:54.80
there by in the room he looks right at my father and says yeah I'm gonna need y'all get to hell out

2048
02:53:56.72 --> 02:54:02.32
and I was just thinking he's about to kill me right now so and he comes up to decide

2049
02:54:02.32 --> 02:54:09.76
my bed and remember the only thing worse my right arm and first one it leans down he puts his

2050
02:54:09.76 --> 02:54:17.92
right arm out as if to like pick me up and so I grab like I clap hands with him as if he's gonna

2051
02:54:17.92 --> 02:54:26.72
pick me up right and he puts the back of his hand on my heart and the back with my hand on his

2052
02:54:26.72 --> 02:54:33.44
and he leans down further and puts his forehead on my forehead and he sits there for about three minutes

2053
02:54:35.20 --> 02:54:41.84
he stands up he packs me on my face and he walks out to this day

2054
02:54:42.88 --> 02:54:47.68
this is one of the most powerful conversations I've ever had in my life and not one word was spoken

2055
02:54:49.84 --> 02:54:56.64
that's being tribal that's tribal that goes much deeper than team you can't train them

2056
02:54:56.64 --> 02:55:03.76
and he walks out of the room and obviously gets emotional when you walk out because my dad walks in

2057
02:55:03.76 --> 02:55:09.04
and I get emotional as soon as you walk out because God forbid we try for him one another can't do that

2058
02:55:09.04 --> 02:55:13.12
my dad walks in and sees me emotional and he went hey first one and he looks at me and

2059
02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.32
like it was a possible look on his face and he just goes

2060
02:55:16.32 --> 02:55:27.68
he marines a fricking weird I was like get out banker you're a banker and it was one of those

2061
02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:37.68
moments man that only people who have bear the burden of a purpose much greater than themselves

2062
02:55:37.68 --> 02:55:45.92
willingly and openly knowing what the odds could be what the odds are what the outcomes could be

2063
02:55:47.28 --> 02:55:54.000
only the people that are willing to love all the way regardless of the amount of pain

2064
02:55:55.52 --> 02:56:04.000
could understand and appreciate that moment I mean and I'm proud to say that that man's now the

2065
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.84
Sergeant Major of the United States Marine Corps there's not a more deserving individual I can think of

2066
02:56:14.16 --> 02:56:21.36
because that guy that guy's one of the guys I found fall on the blood trail that taught me

2067
02:56:22.32 --> 02:56:28.64
if you're gonna love doing it all the way don't waste anyones time doing the halfway thing

2068
02:56:28.64 --> 02:56:36.96
that was an amazing moment that I will take to my grave cherishing knowing that

2069
02:56:38.72 --> 02:56:44.32
that guy just told me without telling me it's okay to not be okay

2070
02:56:47.60 --> 02:56:48.16
it's okay

2071
02:56:48.16 --> 02:57:06.08
I what point did you realize that the drugs were a legit problem the day I was leaving San Antonio the

2072
02:57:09.52 --> 02:57:15.60
the committee general the hospital was ended up getting pretty close to me at my time

2073
02:57:15.60 --> 02:57:22.40
there my time there said came out and he's we're walking out or well he's walking I'm rolling

2074
02:57:22.40 --> 02:57:27.20
I'm still not walking well at this point and he says I'm going to check out over

2075
02:57:28.96 --> 02:57:36.08
it's four three con and he says you know Jake I feel like we should name a haul or something after

2076
02:57:36.08 --> 02:57:41.52
you got for all the shit you put us there I was like hey sir let me do the infamy thing all I can

2077
02:57:41.52 --> 02:57:46.96
let me handle I got it all my lonesome I don't need your help you know and

2078
02:57:49.12 --> 02:58:00.56
he was like you know it's sad to see you go I'm it's I said why I'm I'm scared to death to leave

2079
02:58:02.48 --> 02:58:07.84
and I remember I I basically got a giant bag of drugs before I went over to

2080
02:58:07.84 --> 02:58:16.72
four three con the last thing I did with him was sign of page 11 and because I the higher

2081
02:58:16.72 --> 02:58:22.56
out that told me I'm gonna be every day I told him when I thought about that when what I thought

2082
02:58:22.56 --> 02:58:28.72
about him and so he showed me I'm making me sign of page 11 and I was like put it on my tab bro

2083
02:58:28.72 --> 02:58:34.64
what's the page 11 slap on the wrist pretty much but you can't be promoted for I think it's

2084
02:58:34.64 --> 02:58:42.08
12 months with page 11 and so I was just like he was in DC at the time when I checked out

2085
02:58:42.96 --> 02:58:46.80
and the gunny there was like hey he said he wanted to talk to you know it was like get him on

2086
02:58:46.80 --> 02:58:53.04
speaker phone was taught and I said I told him when I thought about him it was inappropriate and

2087
02:58:53.04 --> 02:58:59.52
I'm not sorry um but he's like you're in the page 11 and gunny was like oh do you want to

2088
02:58:59.52 --> 02:59:08.56
contest this it's like hell no put it on my tab bro oh my wow and um man I had this bag of drugs

2089
02:59:08.56 --> 02:59:13.52
and my brother met up there with me and my brother was gonna drive me the Florida where I was going

2090
02:59:15.36 --> 02:59:23.92
checking a massive 21 and I knew right then because I was like okay at this point I'd already

2091
02:59:23.92 --> 02:59:29.04
started like if I was eating one if I had a family member friend give me a fentanyl pop out of my

2092
02:59:29.60 --> 02:59:34.000
bag of goodies like I would chew it I'd bite it off the stick chew it up and swallow it and

2093
02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:38.96
just lay on the stick and I'd be like hey so who's gonna grab me a fentanyl pop like I

2094
02:59:38.96 --> 02:59:46.64
jake we just gave you know you didn't you thought you did but you didn't I knew like because I was

2095
02:59:46.64 --> 02:59:53.76
like hey listen if I just can't fill nothing matters if I'm completely numb nothing matters

2096
02:59:53.76 --> 03:00:01.60
and then when they gave me that giant bag I was like oh shit I knew how I was gonna end

2097
03:00:02.56 --> 03:00:08.32
well it was like yeah well this is like this is I don't remember they told me like a three months

2098
03:00:08.32 --> 03:00:17.20
supply and I was like no this is like a three weeks supply and um man I started that's how I

2099
03:00:17.20 --> 03:00:25.68
integrated I'm back into civilian society was high as a kite knowing that if I don't have to

2100
03:00:25.68 --> 03:00:34.08
fill and I can do go through this thing numb nothing matters because if you can't fill it who cares

2101
03:00:34.08 --> 03:00:41.76
you know I mean who cares and it was something that really was um it just got worse and worse

2102
03:00:41.76 --> 03:00:49.12
I mean essentially what I did for a year and a half was chase my first high so I did and I

2103
03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:58.56
was finally for about a year there I slept with an over and under 12 gay shotguns

2104
03:00:58.56 --> 03:01:05.20
condition one next to my bed every night and every day I talk myself out of

2105
03:01:05.20 --> 03:01:18.24
utilizing it to end my own life to to where I was almost at the point where I had decided

2106
03:01:19.36 --> 03:01:27.12
why it was okay to do it and I had justified it in my head and why it would be better

2107
03:01:27.12 --> 03:01:43.12
for everyone in my life and around my circle if I was gone and so I but then I was told by family

2108
03:01:43.12 --> 03:01:49.68
that you know you shake the difference between and at this point I'm taking about 55 pills

2109
03:01:49.68 --> 03:01:52.88
three times a day and I was eating between eight and twelve four hundred milligrams and I'll

2110
03:01:52.88 --> 03:01:59.28
pass a day I was on enough medication to kill a village in Africa it was not really and

2111
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:05.20
the fact that I never indeed I mean there's no medical explanation for that and so I

2112
03:02:05.20 --> 03:02:11.68
where were all the drugs coming from? You get them make a phone call get them home yeah

2113
03:02:11.68 --> 03:02:16.48
and so it was that was the least of my worries on how to get the drugs because

2114
03:02:16.48 --> 03:02:24.08
but and to be fair because I was on so much as I came out of the hospital it took a lot to keep me

2115
03:02:25.36 --> 03:02:31.52
where I was I mean if I if I'm even ten minutes late was ten minutes late on one dose

2116
03:02:31.52 --> 03:02:40.08
I'm starting to withdrawal I mean it was bad and so finally I get told you know the difference

2117
03:02:40.08 --> 03:02:47.36
between you living the way you're living and eating a bullet is it's time but the outcome is the

2118
03:02:47.36 --> 03:02:53.12
same you're just slowly killing yourself you look to your brothers it didn't come home and those

2119
03:02:53.12 --> 03:02:58.000
that didn't still love and respect you to not only live but live well because that's the only

2120
03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:07.20
way you can truly honor them is by living well I mean that hit me heart and I realized I'm being

2121
03:03:07.20 --> 03:03:17.28
self-respected so what I'm doing I'm I'm carrying out every day like a victim and I'm not a victim

2122
03:03:17.28 --> 03:03:23.36
I'm a victim I'm a victim I need to start acting like it and so I called my lead physician the next

2123
03:03:23.36 --> 03:03:26.88
one and I said it didn't even do I can get off all the drugs so she said how you're going to do that

2124
03:03:27.68 --> 03:03:33.92
so I'm just not taking the first dose just stopping she said I had highly advised against that

2125
03:03:33.92 --> 03:03:39.92
so why is that so because you probably have a massive heart attack and die I said Roger that

2126
03:03:39.92 --> 03:03:44.96
plan is no go what's planned you look like and she's like you're gonna have to come back to

2127
03:03:44.96 --> 03:03:49.04
BAM see we're gonna have to ween you off the drugs which is not what I wanted to hear

2128
03:03:50.08 --> 03:03:55.04
because it was like when I left him so you're already saying he had to go on like no need to ever come

2129
03:03:55.04 --> 03:04:03.84
back here done do you and done and I was like oh shit all right and I went back there and started

2130
03:04:03.84 --> 03:04:09.12
that process man and let me tell you something I consider and tell you a conviction I know

2131
03:04:09.12 --> 03:04:17.68
why addicts they addicts because that slow withdrawal process of getting clean

2132
03:04:19.44 --> 03:04:28.64
I mean this whole heartedly I don't know what was harder being blown up or getting clean

2133
03:04:28.64 --> 03:04:36.16
I honestly don't know what was harder because I mean hell coming off the drugs they gave you drugs

2134
03:04:36.16 --> 03:04:45.04
to help you come off the drugs and it's like I just you know what the frick it didn't there

2135
03:04:45.04 --> 03:04:49.84
shot or something you can give me and I can get the hell out of here and but there's not how long

2136
03:04:49.84 --> 03:04:56.56
was the process supposed to be six months so I did two and a half I was clean

2137
03:04:56.56 --> 03:05:04.32
because I was like I'm not I can't continue to be this that that hardcore about face though I mean

2138
03:05:05.12 --> 03:05:10.88
that that comment about look which I've said on this podcast many times like look we got to live

2139
03:05:10.88 --> 03:05:16.16
to honor our brothers that didn't come home that's the way it is live well and you get you got

2140
03:05:16.16 --> 03:05:22.96
to live the best possible life you can they don't have that opportunity that thought right there

2141
03:05:22.96 --> 03:05:34.08
is what did it um no because again it was a myriad of things man because again you

2142
03:05:36.24 --> 03:05:40.64
that was the the tipping point but again it's like the people that come over to say you know

2143
03:05:40.64 --> 03:05:45.84
what's the problem is yeah okay I bet you there's more than one so that tipping point

2144
03:05:45.84 --> 03:05:49.84
water some other contributing factors and the reason I'm asking you this so people are

2145
03:05:49.84 --> 03:05:54.80
listening this right now and they're feeling the way you were feeling yep I got a phone call

2146
03:05:54.80 --> 03:06:07.20
about the our first loss from our unit my is on hand and I was like that's done more than

2147
03:06:07.20 --> 03:06:15.28
I thought that would sting and I can't do that to the tribe on top of that there's I can't

2148
03:06:15.28 --> 03:06:22.96
I need to get my shift together and it's gonna be ugly and it's gonna be sloppy and it's not

2149
03:06:22.96 --> 03:06:33.60
gonna be it's gonna be the antithesis of what it should look like but I owe that to them

2150
03:06:33.60 --> 03:06:49.44
I owe that to him that is when I decided that you know what I'm gonna I'm going to try

2151
03:06:49.44 --> 03:07:04.48
really hard to do this life thing the way that I'm supposed to do it I mean I'm gonna go out of my way

2152
03:07:04.16 --> 03:07:12.48
to be to where when my brothers here my name they can smile and their chest can swallow a

2153
03:07:12.48 --> 03:07:22.40
pride and they can say yeah that's my brother yeah that right there is that thing that I was talking

2154
03:07:22.40 --> 03:07:28.000
about earlier like I don't care what anybody thinks when it comes to my brothers and what they think

2155
03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:33.84
yeah that means a lot man yeah that cares it's shit on a way yeah that's that's the stuff

2156
03:07:33.84 --> 03:07:43.36
it's the stuff that'll change the world so you so you go through the two and a half months

2157
03:07:43.68 --> 03:07:50.64
and you get clean what's the temptation like once you're clean are you are you feeling like

2158
03:07:50.64 --> 03:07:58.48
I mean is it always there what is it for a while bro for a while it's all day every day

2159
03:07:58.48 --> 03:08:05.28
every time I leave my room or I have to talk to someone rather I'm related to him or not

2160
03:08:05.28 --> 03:08:10.64
or got for a bit I have to go to like the mall or some shit all I thought about for a while

2161
03:08:11.36 --> 03:08:19.12
was man this would be so much easier if I was I right now all the time so I thought about for a while

2162
03:08:19.12 --> 03:08:26.88
what about booze yeah right so that's a that's a that's a pretty that's a pretty

2163
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:37.12
pretty good safety net and that go from one bad habit to another and you know my family

2164
03:08:37.12 --> 03:08:42.72
doesn't need help and that every and either and so yeah I was like hey listen you know I mean

2165
03:08:42.72 --> 03:08:50.32
I'm not on enough drugs to kill her elephants anymore so I can I could probably just start drinking now

2166
03:08:53.52 --> 03:08:59.44
yeah so little that I realized how awesome food was when I got off all the drugs and I was like

2167
03:08:59.44 --> 03:09:05.68
oh my god food is amazing and I love it because I was amazed the idea about when I went to Iraq

2168
03:09:05.68 --> 03:09:10.72
I easily wait I was probably at 2205 solid I was in some of the best shape of all that

2169
03:09:10.72 --> 03:09:19.84
ever in my life when I love Bansie I ain't always at 162 and then because all I did was

2170
03:09:19.84 --> 03:09:27.12
no shit was drink get rid and capuccinos I didn't eat ever because you feel like you're starving

2171
03:09:27.12 --> 03:09:33.20
like you're really hungry that's why you this saying go you'll never need a fat drug addict

2172
03:09:34.08 --> 03:09:39.52
that's true because you your mind's gonna tell you like oh my god I'm starving then you eat one

2173
03:09:39.52 --> 03:09:46.000
bite of something and it's like you ate an entire cow by yourself and it's just full and then so I

2174
03:09:47.36 --> 03:09:55.36
immediately because we need to remember too there are a myriad of forms of self-medicating

2175
03:09:56.80 --> 03:10:01.52
not just drugs and alcohol I mean it can go on and on and on

2176
03:10:03.12 --> 03:10:08.16
well that's something we need to remember because there's gonna be some people out there that hear

2177
03:10:08.16 --> 03:10:12.64
this and I'm like oh well you know I don't drink excess well you're on the on drugs

2178
03:10:15.12 --> 03:10:26.24
well there's a lot of other avenues what else food oh god I mean porn

2179
03:10:29.36 --> 03:10:33.76
let me exercise I mean there's a million things that you could do in excess

2180
03:10:33.76 --> 03:10:43.28
that you think is gonna save you from your own head yeah it's like an escape right like an escape

2181
03:10:43.92 --> 03:10:51.36
and it brings like that pleasure for that exact yeah you get the same you get the same in

2182
03:10:51.36 --> 03:10:58.24
doorphones release the same that same dopamine and get that same feeling of oh this okay this

2183
03:10:58.24 --> 03:11:07.60
yeah all right so because in all it is all it is is a protection mechanism to keep you from having

2184
03:11:09.36 --> 03:11:15.28
to look inward and go deep into the thing underneath the thing underneath the thing it's all it is

2185
03:11:16.40 --> 03:11:24.24
it's all it is and it's it's very very easy to do I mean because just being humans alone we

2186
03:11:24.24 --> 03:11:31.28
are all addictive by nature I mean we are all to whatever it could be and so we have to be

2187
03:11:32.24 --> 03:11:41.44
cognizant of the fact that you know there's we have to consistently remember that

2188
03:11:44.40 --> 03:11:51.04
we are all always gonna be human we're always gonna be uncomfortable change

2189
03:11:51.04 --> 03:11:57.52
most most people like regimented schedules they like to get up a certain time like a drink

2190
03:11:57.52 --> 03:12:01.44
certain thing eat a certain thing workout a certain time go to lunch a certain time

2191
03:12:02.56 --> 03:12:08.72
by nature all of us hate change anyone who's in a company that goes through a big

2192
03:12:08.72 --> 03:12:15.76
transnis for a big change you know what I'm talking about but we always have to remember that

2193
03:12:15.76 --> 03:12:26.24
just like in the Marines we always say temper gumby the more comfortable you get being uncomfortable

2194
03:12:27.36 --> 03:12:38.40
the happier you're gonna be so at what point in this you get clean what point do you decide

2195
03:12:40.24 --> 03:12:44.40
you're gonna do something significant to try and help other people and you start

2196
03:12:44.40 --> 03:12:50.56
you actually wanted to kill great question well I didn't decide it it was my grandmother told me

2197
03:12:50.56 --> 03:12:59.68
hey I want you to come speak to my rotary club and you know being a man from the south you

2198
03:12:59.68 --> 03:13:05.84
don't tell your grandmother no so I was like okay I'm gonna reluctantly do this and hate it the

2199
03:13:05.84 --> 03:13:12.72
entire time and I did and I showed up and I was easily 40 years by at least 40 years the junior

2200
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:22.000
in the room so I start telling my story and I'm sweating grenades so uncomfortable I could think about

2201
03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:31.20
was like I would love to just crush like 10th and I'll pop right now and it was horrific I mean it was

2202
03:13:31.20 --> 03:13:38.08
a freight train screwing on abortion it was bad but so it was one of those things that like but

2203
03:13:38.08 --> 03:13:43.68
you can't look away type thing it was one of those but I remember walking out of there and I walked

2204
03:13:43.68 --> 03:13:49.76
out of the building I'll never forgive the side of the building and I took a deep breath like

2205
03:13:51.76 --> 03:13:58.48
you made it and then I took that deep breath I was like huh I feel lighter

2206
03:13:58.48 --> 03:14:09.44
I mean not physically my soul fell lighter and I was like oh then it clicked that's what she was

2207
03:14:09.44 --> 03:14:22.32
doing it's tactical therapy I get it that freaking broad she got me because I was I refused to talk to

2208
03:14:22.32 --> 03:14:30.08
I talked to the sidecasters once I got to the hospital and then when I left then when I was getting

2209
03:14:30.08 --> 03:14:37.60
out of the Marine Corps for the VA process and that was it so two or three times because I had nothing

2210
03:14:37.60 --> 03:14:43.28
to say to them was that PTSD that's in TBI thing it's not whatever it's not a real thing

2211
03:14:43.28 --> 03:14:54.24
when I got clean and started to drink and I was like oh shit let's PTSD to TBI I think

2212
03:14:54.24 --> 03:15:04.32
are very, very, very real like very, and I moved came back to what back taxes and I was

2213
03:15:04.32 --> 03:15:13.20
introduced to a couple guys who started to foundation down there and there a couple of seals

2214
03:15:14.24 --> 03:15:21.44
to this day great friends of mine mentors of mine brothers for sure and I called Flipper one in

2215
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:30.80
Flipper two and that's when I was kind of introduced to the nonprofit world and working with

2216
03:15:30.80 --> 03:15:38.56
warriors and their families and first responders and law enforcement officers and their families

2217
03:15:39.84 --> 03:15:48.96
you know it was like they clicked with me like I like I like this I'm never going to get rich or

2218
03:15:48.96 --> 03:15:58.88
wealthy doing this and that's not the point that gave me more that put more in my soul tank

2219
03:15:58.88 --> 03:16:08.40
than any pill or any bottle ever did and it made me realize like oh all right this is the same

2220
03:16:08.40 --> 03:16:15.36
reason I went and visited all the wounded every time I could even we lost guys and the hospital

2221
03:16:15.36 --> 03:16:24.48
like this is why I'm doing this it's greater than me it reminds me daily how insignificant I am

2222
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:36.16
that I'm just another guy that's just using the do stuff that's out of the norm it's hard stuff

2223
03:16:37.28 --> 03:16:41.20
we have anything we're doing should be should be hard it's not we're doing alone

2224
03:16:42.48 --> 03:16:46.72
and when I was working with this organization I was surrounded by people better than me

2225
03:16:46.72 --> 03:16:57.76
by default I was better and consistently pushed harder and harder because I wanted to be held

2226
03:16:57.76 --> 03:17:02.72
with different standards again because even then I wasn't waking up like I'm gonna go out

2227
03:17:02.72 --> 03:17:11.20
my way to be average today no because I had two freaking navy seals that you know we're worried

2228
03:17:11.20 --> 03:17:16.72
they had to have really good tans and they're there had to be great and they had to have this

2229
03:17:16.72 --> 03:17:24.96
one type of really cool sunglasses and I was like hey what I'm gonna do is just I'm just gonna

2230
03:17:24.96 --> 03:17:31.68
work these dudes yeah I can't use a weapon anymore I'm not gonna outrun them God knows I'm not gonna

2231
03:17:31.68 --> 03:17:42.72
out swim a pride can out shoot them I'm about to simply dig up but I could probably home

2232
03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:50.88
yeah I could probably work with the most important tool we all have no important weapon we all have

2233
03:17:52.08 --> 03:17:59.52
I could probably get to where I could out think them so I started to to this date

2234
03:17:59.52 --> 03:18:06.56
it's it's toss up but oh with one of them one of them I passed them all time ago but

2235
03:18:07.28 --> 03:18:12.88
they know they are too that's what makes it even more beautiful but that's when I realized

2236
03:18:12.88 --> 03:18:20.000
like all right I need to be this is what I gotta do this is this is what I'm gonna be called to do

2237
03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:30.24
is to talk to other members of society who've been dealt whatever hand or been dealt a

2238
03:18:30.24 --> 03:18:37.44
blow to let them know like hey yeah right now it sucks but you can come out the other side

2239
03:18:39.28 --> 03:18:46.24
because don't get in that deep darker abit hole don't do that because very few people come out of that

2240
03:18:46.24 --> 03:18:53.84
I know because I tried it over and over again and I never got out of it on my own always took help

2241
03:18:55.20 --> 03:19:00.56
and so at the time in 2012 that's when the study came out from the VA

2242
03:19:02.08 --> 03:19:12.24
on average 22 veterans a day die by suicide and so another marine and a couple of marine's

2243
03:19:12.24 --> 03:19:18.96
business guy got together and Dallas and they're like hey man we gotta do something this is

2244
03:19:20.16 --> 03:19:26.96
you know this is this is our family no one even knows this is a thing with the hell are we doing

2245
03:19:28.72 --> 03:19:35.60
and at the time I'm working at a place that focuses completely on the brain

2246
03:19:35.60 --> 03:19:47.12
I'm surrounded by neuroscience this PhD's MD's and I'm learning a lot of things that

2247
03:19:48.80 --> 03:19:53.92
just reiterated the fact that post-managed stress, rag, brain injury these are very, very

2248
03:19:53.92 --> 03:20:00.96
real things and I worked there for three years while 22 kills started and it basically started

2249
03:20:00.96 --> 03:20:07.20
as an awareness movement and that's where the push-up challenge was born the 22 push-up challenge

2250
03:20:07.92 --> 03:20:13.28
I was started by 22 kills in 2012 this was this and that went viral in 2016

2251
03:20:14.96 --> 03:20:24.88
so you know overnight success is not a real thing and so I'm working at this center of the whole time

2252
03:20:24.88 --> 03:20:30.64
and then there's some change up and leadership at 22 kills and I kind of found myself drifting

2253
03:20:30.64 --> 03:20:38.88
away from the work I was doing at the center because it just wasn't it wasn't getting to the

2254
03:20:38.88 --> 03:20:44.000
part of the soul that I wanted to be in and it wasn't getting to that like people I've been

2255
03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:49.76
asked like how how long are you gonna speak because give the travel schedule you know it's brutal right

2256
03:20:50.48 --> 03:20:57.20
and I thought about it for an end on second I thought okay well when I walk off a stage

2257
03:20:57.20 --> 03:21:02.08
the first time I walk off a stage and I feel like I didn't leave a piece of my soul there

2258
03:21:02.72 --> 03:21:08.32
that's the last time I'll do it because again it's mutually beneficial

2259
03:21:09.84 --> 03:21:16.32
and if it's not then in your presenter you're only gonna fake it for so long

2260
03:21:17.92 --> 03:21:22.32
people don't really that's like I feel like I ran a marathon when I'm done presenting for an hour

2261
03:21:22.32 --> 03:21:29.52
I'm mentally physically and emotionally exhausted and if you're not you're faking it

2262
03:21:30.88 --> 03:21:35.92
and so that's when I I left there and you know what I learned after three years

2263
03:21:35.92 --> 03:21:39.36
or working at that place let's completely centered around the brain and the mind

2264
03:21:40.72 --> 03:21:46.72
and it's unfortunate but essentially I learned after three years at that place I said we don't know

2265
03:21:46.72 --> 03:21:56.56
shit about the brain that I mean again I mean I'm not gonna can't decode it it's just

2266
03:21:56.56 --> 03:22:02.40
is what it is why do you think we're still still spending billions and billions of dollars

2267
03:22:03.28 --> 03:22:06.24
on all this research and all these studies and trying to figure it out

2268
03:22:07.76 --> 03:22:11.68
because we just don't understand it that's why we you know we you talk about all

2269
03:22:11.68 --> 03:22:18.000
timeers and CTE we don't even have the technology and the imaging to recognize these things

2270
03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:23.12
in a living human we put a man on the moon in 1969

2271
03:22:25.92 --> 03:22:33.52
can't tell you if you have CTE wire life you know for me it's like hey let's step back and look at

2272
03:22:33.52 --> 03:22:43.76
our priorities because one thing everyone's got is a brain everyone and the problem with the brain

2273
03:22:43.76 --> 03:22:51.52
is there's no prosthetic for that you get the one you got and that's it why are we not

2274
03:22:51.52 --> 03:23:00.32
hyper focused on honing this weapon that makes us who we are and so I the twins you kill

2275
03:23:00.32 --> 03:23:06.72
approached me and said hey we would love for you to come run 22 kill we can keep the lights on for

2276
03:23:06.72 --> 03:23:13.60
about another month and a half and you don't get health insurance and you're gonna have to take

2277
03:23:13.60 --> 03:23:22.80
pick up I was like let me think about it absolutely yes because I want to be able to talk

2278
03:23:22.80 --> 03:23:31.12
and share what I've been through with warriors and first responders and law enforcement

2279
03:23:31.12 --> 03:23:37.36
officers and their families and say hey listen you see that score like that one's worth it

2280
03:23:39.04 --> 03:23:45.20
with some over here don't do that that one's not worth it you're gonna have to fight these demons

2281
03:23:45.20 --> 03:23:51.04
there's no way around it but you can win you just have to keep fighting

2282
03:23:51.04 --> 03:23:56.72
because no matter what no matter where you find yourself in life you're gonna have to fight

2283
03:23:57.68 --> 03:24:02.88
because none of us are getting up and picking out our unicorn we're just not

2284
03:24:05.04 --> 03:24:12.56
yeah you wake up every day and it's you versus you and so that's why I was drawn to that and

2285
03:24:12.56 --> 03:24:23.04
we had a really big first couple years I was there and not all cause I mean it's had to do

2286
03:24:23.04 --> 03:24:27.92
with a myriad of people the people that support us the people that say one of my biggest

2287
03:24:27.92 --> 03:24:33.84
regards was never serving and I'm like hey who told you who lied to you and said that you

2288
03:24:33.84 --> 03:24:42.08
have to wear a uniform to be a service to your nation because you don't you don't that's

2289
03:24:42.08 --> 03:24:48.48
a that's a misnomer I don't wear uniform anymore I mean they do you I mean they do you

2290
03:24:49.68 --> 03:24:55.36
doesn't mean we're not serving I don't do what I do because it's easy

2291
03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:05.28
I do it because it's hard and the employees they work for 20s who can do it because it's hard

2292
03:25:05.28 --> 03:25:17.44
and then the face of tremendous loss they fight on that's character they're doing their

2293
03:25:17.44 --> 03:25:23.60
dash justice because they're moving a mountain that our own government looks at and says hey

2294
03:25:23.60 --> 03:25:29.44
pick up the corner that rug and start sweeping and look the other way and maybe it'll go away

2295
03:25:29.44 --> 03:25:46.000
it's not going away what can people that are listening do to help the cause you know I got this

2296
03:25:46.000 --> 03:26:00.16
kind of buddy of mine who was actually an officer in the army who's really wounded years ago and

2297
03:26:01.44 --> 03:26:07.68
I'm gonna echo it just because he's right it's you hear all the time like I want to help

2298
03:26:07.68 --> 03:26:16.40
I don't know right me here a lot from reverts you know I want to I want to help save the

2299
03:26:16.40 --> 03:26:20.72
puppies that don't have a home I tell people all the time if we were trying to raise money

2300
03:26:21.84 --> 03:26:27.92
for dogs that died back so that we'd be sitting on a billion dollars it's true I mean it's just true

2301
03:26:28.56 --> 03:26:37.52
I mean how many dogs are screwed over a person very few right but it is what it is

2302
03:26:37.52 --> 03:26:48.000
but if you want to wake up and you want to serve or you want to help we all have three things

2303
03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:54.08
of value every human on this entire spin and ball of shit has three things of value

2304
03:26:55.68 --> 03:27:02.56
time talent and treasure and if you're not willing to sacrifice some of one of those three things

2305
03:27:02.56 --> 03:27:12.48
you're just talking that's it you're talking if you want to help start sacrificing one of those three

2306
03:27:12.48 --> 03:27:20.56
things I don't care if it's 22 k. I don't care if it's to the humans aside I don't care

2307
03:27:21.76 --> 03:27:31.28
sacrifice because every time we put on that uniform and our firefighters and our

2308
03:27:31.28 --> 03:27:36.80
paramedics and our EMTs and our law enforcement officers I mean tell me if you would feel as

2309
03:27:36.80 --> 03:27:44.40
confident as you did going to a foreign country going to hook in jab find the bad guys and kill them

2310
03:27:45.44 --> 03:27:53.12
tell me if you would have felt as confident doing that knowing that there are people back here

2311
03:27:53.12 --> 03:28:04.40
whom you've never met while in the kick in the door to your house while it is a blaze and save your family.

2312
03:28:04.40 --> 03:28:09.84
I mean I think all those people every single time I do this podcast and that's exactly what I say

2313
03:28:09.84 --> 03:28:17.92
for taking care of our home while we were gone that's absolutely and so that's why it's

2314
03:28:17.92 --> 03:28:24.72
for me if you're not willing to sacrifice just like these men and women do on a daily basis

2315
03:28:25.44 --> 03:28:31.36
you're talking you're talking if there's people out there that can write a check and that's enough

2316
03:28:31.92 --> 03:28:40.08
and that's okay that's okay you're doing your part you're doing your part that's all right

2317
03:28:40.08 --> 03:28:45.04
there are people that want to share talents there are people that say hey I want to volunteer I'm a body

2318
03:28:45.04 --> 03:28:54.48
used me I'm here that's service that's sacrificing and we have a myriad of ways to do it and it's

2319
03:28:55.20 --> 03:29:01.12
a beautiful thing because we're getting better and better at what we're doing because we're not

2320
03:29:01.12 --> 03:29:08.16
doing research and studies we're implementing the things that work and we're able to tell these men

2321
03:29:08.16 --> 03:29:14.72
and women because it's notorious in the warrior community and you're gonna know right when I said

2322
03:29:15.76 --> 03:29:26.64
when you see a brother okay bro you good how are you I'm good okay how do we get you great

2323
03:29:26.64 --> 03:29:40.40
because I want you great does greatness but gets greatness that's that's the living well piece

2324
03:29:41.92 --> 03:29:47.20
and we have to do it as a tribe together I don't give a shit if you ever put a uniform on the

2325
03:29:47.20 --> 03:29:55.28
day in your life if you're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with people that experience trauma

2326
03:29:55.28 --> 03:30:00.32
before the trauma and they know they've got a thing underneath of thing underneath of thing

2327
03:30:01.04 --> 03:30:05.92
and you're willing to say hey let's go start picking up pebbles and moving them because we'll

2328
03:30:05.92 --> 03:30:11.68
move this mountain it's gonna be long and an arduous and a painstaking process but look to your

2329
03:30:11.68 --> 03:30:19.76
left and right that's what makes it worth it and we're doing that and we're just getting better at it

2330
03:30:19.76 --> 03:30:27.76
and yeah it's stressful and yeah I hate fundraising and yeah I hate it but it all comes with it

2331
03:30:27.76 --> 03:30:34.72
it comes with the territory so some people are gonna want to so what 22 kill dot com is that the best place to

2332
03:30:34.72 --> 03:30:42.80
go look yeah go to tooncykill.com read about learn about what we're doing learn about the things that we've

2333
03:30:42.80 --> 03:30:55.60
decided to really engage our focus on and why we're we're not just helping and treating the warrior

2334
03:30:55.60 --> 03:31:01.76
the first father law enforcement officer it's the we want to the entire family because

2335
03:31:03.60 --> 03:31:09.12
when you have when you pull up to the tire shop and you have four bat tires you can't you're not

2336
03:31:09.12 --> 03:31:17.04
gonna change just one tire right you gotta change it all four we got to treat the family as a unit

2337
03:31:18.88 --> 03:31:22.56
because I'm speaking from experience so I say we leave a big wake in our path

2338
03:31:25.20 --> 03:31:32.64
and I would not be surprised if my family has post-match trust just from dealing with me

2339
03:31:32.64 --> 03:31:41.44
and the sad thing is I'm not joking you know I was thinking about the nurses and doctors

2340
03:31:41.44 --> 03:31:45.76
you left in the hospital as well as you mentioned earlier they're better people because of

2341
03:31:45.76 --> 03:31:51.20
dealing with me so it's but I mean listen man we're and just so people note

2342
03:31:52.08 --> 03:31:57.76
22 kill dot com they're like well don't you have to be dot org the or you know no

2343
03:31:57.76 --> 03:32:04.96
that's you listening to the media got for bed do your own homework figured out it's

2344
03:32:05.52 --> 03:32:10.32
you can have dot org dot com dot net doesn't matter that does not denote if you're a five

2345
03:32:10.32 --> 03:32:18.56
or one see three or not just for the record and we have our saying it's 20 to kill and I came on

2346
03:32:18.56 --> 03:32:25.68
I changed it to one tribe one fight because you hear all the time in the military especially one team

2347
03:32:25.68 --> 03:32:33.04
one fight one team one fight and I was around some guys you use the we're tribe and

2348
03:32:34.64 --> 03:32:38.08
I thought about it in the more and more I thought about it I'll speak in one time

2349
03:32:39.60 --> 03:32:46.08
remember where I was but I went to say one team one fight but I said one tribe one fight

2350
03:32:47.12 --> 03:32:52.32
and it's because it's too easy to be a team if you if you have the same letterhead

2351
03:32:52.32 --> 03:33:01.84
on your business cards or you have the same insignia on your shirt that makes you a team

2352
03:33:04.24 --> 03:33:11.12
the tribe goes way deeper than that the tribe is when my first artist put his forehead

2353
03:33:11.12 --> 03:33:21.44
against mine it doesn't say a word yet I learned a life lesson and I get the acceptance

2354
03:33:21.44 --> 03:33:27.04
that I was longing for without even speaking that's a tribe is driven by the same

2355
03:33:27.04 --> 03:33:33.20
ideals the same conviction the same passion I get asked all the time like why do you think why are we

2356
03:33:33.20 --> 03:33:39.68
still a war or I reckon I've got a saying I'll see because you can't kill your way out of an idea

2357
03:33:42.88 --> 03:33:43.52
that's why

2358
03:33:43.52 --> 03:33:55.84
that's what it is God forbid we call it that but just with us we so we have programs like

2359
03:33:55.84 --> 03:34:02.08
Camp Baha'ala which is a program where we can we take up words first responders law force

2360
03:34:02.08 --> 03:34:07.60
and officers the most in the early side of it is we're taking them up in the helicopter

2361
03:34:07.60 --> 03:34:13.28
and taking them to kill hogs out of helicopter like as if you don't like that then you don't

2362
03:34:13.28 --> 03:34:20.96
like freedom but we you know we also you you can take them fishing you can take them to the range

2363
03:34:20.96 --> 03:34:27.52
we can but there it's always followed up by fireside chat that's where the money's made

2364
03:34:29.28 --> 03:34:36.16
that's where you got to be vulnerable you'll get your adrenaline kick and then be willing to

2365
03:34:36.16 --> 03:34:43.60
lower your wall and talk about the real shit you know then we have stay the course which is that's

2366
03:34:43.60 --> 03:34:48.24
a traditional therapy that's the this is the you can't be holiday non-traditional stay the course

2367
03:34:48.24 --> 03:34:52.88
is very traditional it's the one-on-one therapy with the warrior first owner his or her family

2368
03:34:54.96 --> 03:35:02.72
and listen the reason that that was an attractive approach was because if you look back on what is

2369
03:35:02.72 --> 03:35:08.40
the most successful outcome measures as far as therapy goes and as far as treating matters of the mind

2370
03:35:09.52 --> 03:35:15.20
that has the best track record the one-on-one I think everyone on the spin and ballicator

2371
03:35:15.20 --> 03:35:22.16
I should talk to professional way the least once a month every single person and I'm saying that

2372
03:35:22.16 --> 03:35:28.08
is the guy that I would I would launch my piss bottle in the hospital that wanted to come in my room

2373
03:35:28.08 --> 03:35:34.16
now I'm telling you right now I wish I had started that a long time ago because it would have

2374
03:35:34.16 --> 03:35:42.72
saved me from a lot of shit I've had to do with because I let my pride win that's it I mean don't

2375
03:35:42.72 --> 03:35:49.36
be afraid to say what it is we started a thing called the Brave Program which is women's specific

2376
03:35:49.36 --> 03:35:59.92
because believe it or not neither sex knows everything that just don't there's power numbers but

2377
03:36:01.44 --> 03:36:06.08
women when you break it down you break the numbers down to the bare bones they're leading the

2378
03:36:06.08 --> 03:36:10.80
charge and everything in a negative light and that's I think it has a lot to do with there a

2379
03:36:10.80 --> 03:36:16.56
much smaller population when it comes to the service community so there are more apt to be ice to

2380
03:36:16.56 --> 03:36:24.72
do one self-medication isolation you know and then and they don't have nearly as big as a

2381
03:36:24.72 --> 03:36:31.92
immediate tribe to depend on as we do because they're just way less of them and so that's that's

2382
03:36:31.92 --> 03:36:37.92
our Brave Program and they can go do all the things that all the guys do but it's women's specific

2383
03:36:39.04 --> 03:36:44.16
because they need to be empowered to and it's our job to help them do that without judgment

2384
03:36:44.16 --> 03:36:50.08
and we also have the white star families program that we're building out which is basically

2385
03:36:50.08 --> 03:36:54.08
you have the gold star families which started by the DOD well fortunately the white star families

2386
03:36:54.08 --> 03:36:59.68
don't have a seat at that table white star families they're family family members who fall and

2387
03:36:59.68 --> 03:37:08.32
victim to suicide and we want to give them a table they deserve a damn table as you talk to those kids

2388
03:37:09.20 --> 03:37:12.72
they don't give a crap out of their mom or dad they just know they don't have a mom or dad

2389
03:37:12.72 --> 03:37:21.92
that's enough for me far be it for must and I honor someone like Lewis Pooleur who the hell are we

2390
03:37:23.76 --> 03:37:28.72
I don't give a crap what society says that the how I should feel about that

2391
03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:34.56
it's let me tell you something this is something everyone he's known unfortunately I bet a lot of

2392
03:37:34.56 --> 03:37:39.84
your listeners do know already so it's such just a word until it affects you personally

2393
03:37:39.84 --> 03:37:48.24
it's just a word and I hear a lot where there's some corporations or owners of a mom and

2394
03:37:48.24 --> 03:37:52.80
pop shop well Jake you know we would love to support you but 22 kills are pretty strong name

2395
03:37:55.12 --> 03:38:01.36
so's cancer and AIDS it's supposed to get your attention that's the point start the conversation

2396
03:38:03.68 --> 03:38:08.32
because you know we hear all the time knowledge is power no it's not and I'll just power when it's

2397
03:38:08.32 --> 03:38:15.92
shared then it becomes powerful and I tell people just like it I'll tell you if you can't support us

2398
03:38:17.28 --> 03:38:23.60
because of a name if you can't look past a name to get to the root cause of an issue consider yourself

2399
03:38:23.60 --> 03:38:30.40
part of the problem it's that all you're doing is feeding a stigma that's killing

2400
03:38:30.40 --> 03:38:39.76
the best men and women this nation's got to offer well I'll tell you what I think that's probably a

2401
03:38:39.76 --> 03:38:47.44
pretty good place to wrap we've been going for a while and especially because you just

2402
03:38:49.84 --> 03:38:56.32
made very clear the reason why I wanted to have you come on this podcast now because you know

2403
03:38:56.32 --> 03:39:01.60
again this ties everything together that I've been talking about for the past three podcasts

2404
03:39:03.92 --> 03:39:06.32
you know you got a guy like Lewis Polar Jr

2405
03:39:10.88 --> 03:39:25.20
and we got to do something yeah cause it's still going on and you're out there and you're

2406
03:39:25.20 --> 03:39:29.76
people on the front lines fighting it and you know I was watching a video that you had on your

2407
03:39:29.76 --> 03:39:38.48
YouTube channel and it's just pictures pictures soldiers pictures of Marines pictures of service

2408
03:39:38.48 --> 03:39:43.92
men and women and they're just coming up on the screen and it's all them you know in their

2409
03:39:43.92 --> 03:39:56.24
uniforms and overseas and back home and and I know what each one of those pictures is

2410
03:39:57.52 --> 03:40:04.96
and so I thank you for coming on obviously thanks for your service and thanks for everything you've

2411
03:40:04.96 --> 03:40:10.40
done and thanks for your sacrifice and thanks for what you're doing right now

2412
03:40:10.40 --> 03:40:25.76
well let me tell you I learned a long time ago as you're guys like us you know the mead

2413
03:40:25.76 --> 03:40:30.48
and the knuckle dryers the odd you I'm sick of you're in the thank you shirt service

2414
03:40:31.68 --> 03:40:35.28
you know it was impossible for me for a long time to go in the public place

2415
03:40:35.28 --> 03:40:40.24
because if I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt it's abundantly apparent I had a shitty day at

2416
03:40:40.24 --> 03:40:46.16
the office somewhere along the line it was impossible for me to get anything done go buy bread and

2417
03:40:46.16 --> 03:40:52.40
go home without someone stopping me and I hated that afternoon there yeah thank you for your

2418
03:40:52.40 --> 03:40:58.32
service I was like man so annoying I don't want to just want to get bread and go

2419
03:40:58.32 --> 03:41:05.12
well you'll never done on me until few years ago maybe they're doing that for them

2420
03:41:06.96 --> 03:41:14.48
maybe it's as much for them as it is for me and then that's all about why I signed up

2421
03:41:15.20 --> 03:41:19.84
because I it's because I thought they were worth it thought their families were worth it

2422
03:41:20.88 --> 03:41:24.72
so I was told one time I thank you when I said you're worth it

2423
03:41:24.72 --> 03:41:35.28
two things happened the conversation ended there and secondly they probably walked out of there

2424
03:41:35.28 --> 03:41:41.92
a little taller than they walked in and I was like oh thanks God I get it now not about me

2425
03:41:43.76 --> 03:41:48.72
I'll tell you just like it's all them your worth it your families worth it

2426
03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:54.32
all you're listening is I feel the same way even though guaranteed I'm gonna have a

2427
03:41:54.32 --> 03:41:59.92
million differences with a million different of them it worth it I do it all again tomorrow

2428
03:42:01.20 --> 03:42:08.40
I said a bad day at the office and you know it's I just want to leave your listeners with this

2429
03:42:08.40 --> 03:42:16.32
is that there's power just trust me when I tell you there's so much power we're about to start

2430
03:42:16.32 --> 03:42:26.16
this thing called the tribal council which I think is gonna it's a peer to peer support group and I think I'm

2431
03:42:26.16 --> 03:42:29.60
praying to God that it has the power behind it that I think it does

2432
03:42:31.52 --> 03:42:35.60
where and I'm gonna leave the jars I'll be the first one to stand up on the soap box

2433
03:42:36.56 --> 03:42:41.84
I'm just gonna open up my chest cavity pour my soul out in front of a group of people I've never met

2434
03:42:41.84 --> 03:42:48.48
and say here's the shit I know with here's what I've been through this is what I'm doing to address

2435
03:42:48.48 --> 03:42:57.28
it and this is how you can hold me accountable who's next there's a lot of power in that

2436
03:42:58.80 --> 03:43:04.48
because we have to remember in our community you hear all the time be accountable to yourself be

2437
03:43:04.48 --> 03:43:06.80
accountable to your brothers be accountable to your sisters

2438
03:43:06.80 --> 03:43:15.44
unless you have brutal honesty first you have manufactured accountability

2439
03:43:17.84 --> 03:43:24.88
so when I ask you how you're doing don't tell me good to appease me because I'm gonna call you on the

2440
03:43:24.88 --> 03:43:34.64
shit be great you know so thank you I'm gonna turn it back on you thank you for doing what you're

2441
03:43:34.64 --> 03:43:41.20
doing because dude you're you're tip of the spirit just like anyone like you are leading the

2442
03:43:41.20 --> 03:43:48.72
charge this wasn't easy for you to do what you had me come here to do and do when you talked about

2443
03:43:48.72 --> 03:43:55.92
Chessie when you talked about Louis Jeir when you had me this is not the popular thing to do

2444
03:43:58.32 --> 03:44:02.24
but you said I've never been okay with the status quo why start now

2445
03:44:02.24 --> 03:44:08.16
so thank you for everything you've done and continue to do well I'll tell you this is

2446
03:44:09.76 --> 03:44:13.60
it's literally an honor to be able to do this people throw that word around all the time it

2447
03:44:13.60 --> 03:44:17.52
isn't honor for me to sit here it's an honor for me to sit here with you all the guests

2448
03:44:17.52 --> 03:44:25.28
have had on here to be able to tell these stories that I I'm sick sometimes that they're they're

2449
03:44:25.28 --> 03:44:32.96
not carried on and it's an honor for me to be able to pass on these stories so that people know

2450
03:44:32.96 --> 03:44:40.72
and people can learn and it's it's a humbling experience to do it as well because being in the

2451
03:44:40.72 --> 03:44:49.52
shadow of people like these guys people like yourself it's it's a humbling experience to be around

2452
03:44:49.52 --> 03:44:59.44
warriors like that from all phases of history and we're gonna keep doing it and when you get

2453
03:44:59.44 --> 03:45:05.36
that program rolling get your ass back on here we'll talk about it we'll talk about how it's going

2454
03:45:05.36 --> 03:45:10.16
and we'll get the word out on that thing too right on also don't threaten me with a good time

2455
03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:16.88
echo Charles yes you got a quickly quickly

2456
03:45:16.88 --> 03:45:23.36
if anybody wants to support themselves I have a question first man I knew that was coming

2457
03:45:23.36 --> 03:45:29.36
is that a common stereo type about Navy seals they got to go tanning they need the cool

2458
03:45:29.36 --> 03:45:36.72
sunglasses they mean nice hair not really jockel though you don't go tanning no no the stereo

2459
03:45:36.72 --> 03:45:44.08
typical seal thing was something that I didn't like you know I didn't like it and the

2460
03:45:44.08 --> 03:45:52.000
older I got the more I disliked it and it's you know but it's a reality of you know

2461
03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:58.64
especially during that during the 80s 90s for all the 80s 90s were the reputation but you know

2462
03:45:58.64 --> 03:46:04.08
the guys in Vietnam too man those guys like like in Vietnam they wore blue jeans in the field

2463
03:46:04.08 --> 03:46:08.40
they you know because they kept off leeches and they were tougher but then you know guess what

2464
03:46:08.40 --> 03:46:14.40
that turns into like something where guys at some guy in 1992 is wearing blue jeans with his

2465
03:46:14.40 --> 03:46:20.000
candies and it's like oh no he's the new that bro now where I show up at the teams it was like hey

2466
03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:26.32
we you know I want to have long hair and be like a cool guy we you did oh yeah yeah for sure

2467
03:46:26.32 --> 03:46:32.40
there's somebody just put a picture out on the interwebs of me with long hair like circa 1991

2468
03:46:32.40 --> 03:46:38.72
yeah yeah the long side burns and everything because I wanted to be joke cool and but what happened

2469
03:46:38.72 --> 03:46:44.24
was well number one the war started number two I started working really closely with conventional

2470
03:46:44.24 --> 03:46:49.52
forces on my first deployment a little bit on my second deployment ton also I did multiple

2471
03:46:49.52 --> 03:46:56.08
shipboard deployments where I worked with Marines very closely even when I was young and yeah so I

2472
03:46:56.08 --> 03:47:03.44
just it was one of those things that like when I would hear it at first I would be like oh that's

2473
03:47:03.44 --> 03:47:07.92
no big deal but then what I realized was it was a real thing when you when you were in the stereotype

2474
03:47:07.92 --> 03:47:14.40
as I moved into leadership positions and I would hear that stereotype I realized it was a real thing

2475
03:47:14.40 --> 03:47:19.60
and that that real thing wasn't it wasn't funny it wasn't funny because when you when you

2476
03:47:19.60 --> 03:47:26.000
eat a meta a Marine Corps battalion commander and you have long hair your uniform doesn't look right or you

2477
03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:33.36
meet an army battalion commander or an army brigade commander or a senior or a gunney sergeant

2478
03:47:34.16 --> 03:47:39.44
or a company first sergeant when you meet one of them somebody that's been in the Marine Corps for

2479
03:47:39.44 --> 03:47:46.40
23 years and you can't put on and blouse your your pants and your boots it doesn't matter how good

2480
03:47:46.40 --> 03:47:50.48
you are in the field they're looking at you and thinking oh this guy can't even blouse boots I don't

2481
03:47:50.48 --> 03:47:58.32
want him around that's so that stereotype even though it had definitely was rooted in truth like

2482
03:47:58.32 --> 03:48:01.84
hey man when we got to her body everyone had shape heads everyone had square away uniforms didn't

2483
03:48:01.84 --> 03:48:06.32
allow patches we talked about them before you know we we had guys like if we could we put a whole

2484
03:48:06.32 --> 03:48:13.84
element in army camouflage uniform so ace use they just look like army sir yeah so I was against it

2485
03:48:13.84 --> 03:48:19.20
but I get the humor of it and I have you know I don't take anything that personally thanks

2486
03:48:19.20 --> 03:48:25.44
so okay so it's a stereotype like in at work can I thought he meant maybe like out at the club

2487
03:48:25.44 --> 03:48:30.000
or whatever like you know need seals tend to be more into you know what's funny is you know

2488
03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.32
who made a joke about this Tim Kennedy we were here we were recording the podcast

2489
03:48:34.32 --> 03:48:40.96
Tim Kennedy was literally doing a photo shoot and he was like he's got long hair and he was like

2490
03:48:40.96 --> 03:48:47.12
oh you know I'm not like Hollywood seal and I was like dang dude I don't have hair yeah

2491
03:48:47.12 --> 03:48:54.24
yeah I'll tell you why let me give it give you the the Barney version of everything he just said

2492
03:48:54.24 --> 03:48:58.88
this is one of the things I dig about jocca and it has nothing to do with this following

2493
03:48:58.88 --> 03:49:07.04
or what he did it's because because he he's authentic and he's intentional and everything that he

2494
03:49:07.04 --> 03:49:17.52
does and we should long to be around that a lot more yep I'm gonna have to go ahead and agree

2495
03:49:17.52 --> 03:49:24.08
with you on that one so that's when you sort of learned hey hairs just to look good this is

2496
03:49:24.08 --> 03:49:29.92
after you shave your head by the way yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure does it mean anything else

2497
03:49:29.92 --> 03:49:35.68
I'm here to win yeah but that's that was that was me growing up in the teams yeah yeah you know

2498
03:49:35.68 --> 03:49:41.92
that's why Tim Kennedy was gonna hear this I was making fun of making fun of my well he was

2499
03:49:41.92 --> 03:49:48.16
making fun of my uh people yeah yeah your people of the above my people having long hair but he had

2500
03:49:48.16 --> 03:49:53.76
long hair and doing a photo shoot you know who said that you know Matt Baster at Matt Baster

2501
03:49:53.76 --> 03:49:59.20
on one of his videos he's he he he alluded to that oh it's no it's real yeah it's a real no and

2502
03:49:59.20 --> 03:50:04.32
it's a real thing and Tim Kennedy is a hundred percent right seal because because yeah there's

2503
03:50:04.32 --> 03:50:11.12
there's some seals where you're like oh I know 100 percent let me tell you one thing I I I just

2504
03:50:11.12 --> 03:50:21.84
object to in in a real strong way somebody using some kind of hair product right like that's no

2505
03:50:21.84 --> 03:50:26.64
that's a no more than tanning that's a no oh no one actually tan so that's not a real thing

2506
03:50:26.64 --> 03:50:33.60
oh it's a real thing I was on the I was on the I was on the org and the nineties and there was the

2507
03:50:33.60 --> 03:50:41.92
there's the marine recon guys and they straight up had the foil like reflectors under their

2508
03:50:41.92 --> 03:50:46.40
chin's out when they were sun tanning I got to kick out of that but it doesn't matter it doesn't

2509
03:50:46.40 --> 03:50:54.08
matter if they that there was a dozen recon marines out in in speedos straight up tanning with baby oil

2510
03:50:54.08 --> 03:50:58.96
it doesn't matter the reality was the seals were the voluauly would tanning guys that's the

2511
03:50:58.96 --> 03:51:04.16
way it is that's okay that's what you got to do at the same time bro to though it'll be very clear

2512
03:51:05.20 --> 03:51:14.16
that it's me'd saying it or Tim Kennedy or Matt or okay that's one thing okay

2513
03:51:14.88 --> 03:51:23.12
but if like if Joe public civilian says something that's like hey bro yeah yeah

2514
03:51:23.12 --> 03:51:30.32
I don't know that Joe public would actually know that yeah that's what we roll out oh if we

2515
03:51:30.32 --> 03:51:38.72
rolled out all the stereotypes for the services like marines dumb jarhead uh crayon the crayon thing

2516
03:51:38.72 --> 03:51:44.96
that's the big marine core one what crayon crayon either yeah crayons that's like legit thing

2517
03:51:44.96 --> 03:51:50.48
the the army's got there you know who the things and you know we don't have that kind of

2518
03:51:50.48 --> 03:51:57.04
all that kind of thing going on uh green braise you know smoking cigarettes you know that's what

2519
03:51:57.04 --> 03:52:01.20
the seals would say like oh yeah they're over there smoking cigarettes and even donuts you know so

2520
03:52:01.84 --> 03:52:09.28
it's just little stereotypes that have some some bases of reality but you know you can't put

2521
03:52:09.28 --> 03:52:12.96
a stir so that's why stereotypes are stereotypes there's some levels of reality to it but

well there it is boom and mook tasty yeah mint chocolate chip and way way you're coming out with a new

2543
03:54:23.28 --> 03:54:27.68
yeah but that we're working that those won't be out for a little bit so there's new discipline coming

2544
03:54:27.68 --> 03:54:36.16
out it's new flavor one of the flavors yeah what are flavors is it's I don't know if this is okay

2545
03:54:36.16 --> 03:54:40.96
right we might have to rebrand it something else because it can't be jocco if it is

2546
03:54:42.16 --> 03:54:49.68
coconut pineapple here it's tasty okay so here's what I can't believe it so anyway so jocco's

2547
03:54:49.68 --> 03:54:56.40
hardcore right authentic authentic hardcore right it's good okay so one of the main

2548
03:54:57.76 --> 03:55:02.88
important issues with developing these supplements which are good supplements by the way

2549
03:55:02.88 --> 03:55:09.20
is taste is that hardcore does that seem hardcore do you he thinks that I would like

2550
03:55:09.20 --> 03:55:14.80
when I originally was making supplements he thought that that my I would have no priority on taste like

2551
03:55:14.80 --> 03:55:18.16
if it tastes bad doesn't matter right does it suck it it's actually better if it tastes

2552
03:55:18.16 --> 03:55:23.60
to that false that counter okay I wasn't thinking but you could think that again that I

2553
03:55:23.60 --> 03:55:26.80
didn't know what in order to drink this you could just gotta get like you just gotta

2554
03:55:26.80 --> 03:55:30.56
grit your teeth and get song potentially like hey if that happens it happens kind of like if

2555
03:55:30.56 --> 03:55:33.44
it's not like if it's not like I don't feel that way because the reality is when

2556
03:55:33.44 --> 03:55:38.72
supplements taste like crap you don't eat it so then what's the point yeah so there you go

2557
03:55:38.72 --> 03:55:43.20
the flank that's what he did that's what that is the flank with the taste nonetheless

2558
03:55:43.20 --> 03:55:49.28
taste good and I think peanut collada pineapple coconut whatever I think that's a good idea

2559
03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:57.12
hey how much to our whole way root yes oh my people in Hawaii yes and most by the way is

2560
03:55:57.12 --> 03:56:02.56
mint chocolate chip yeah mint chocolate there's no chips there's no chips good point

2561
03:56:02.56 --> 03:56:09.60
same kind of feel I've never heard without chips kind of terrible for a little bit tough to deal

2562
03:56:09.60 --> 03:56:16.24
way yeah it will taste good though we can we can run that yeah reports are in good

2563
03:56:16.88 --> 03:56:22.16
very good also oh I hear good things about the mixability too right now oh just that's a big deal

2564
03:56:22.16 --> 03:56:27.68

2584
03:58:32.48 --> 03:58:37.84
or whatever he isn't gonna buy just carry on shopping that's you know do you think good way to

2585
03:58:37.84 --> 03:58:46.80
support very good also the alternative is we do like 40 minutes of advertisements in the

2586
03:58:46.80 --> 03:58:52.64
I don't have a problem with that that's not happening well yeah you're kind of anti-advertisements

2587
03:58:52.64 --> 03:58:56.96
as far as advertisements go yeah even like on you you know how when you watch youtube video

2588
03:58:56.96 --> 03:59:04.72
you can add in the in the beginning of the video I have youtube read do you have youtube read too

2589
03:59:04.72 --> 03:59:10.48
$999 a month you can spend you press click and it just starts playing the video no advertisement

2590
03:59:10.48 --> 03:59:15.20
here's the thing I don't mind the advertisements that's how I find out about like a bunch of

2591
03:59:15.20 --> 03:59:20.16
the new music come out a lot of like um like you know intermittent this fast thing weird

2592
03:59:20.16 --> 03:59:24.08
I had a guy the other day he was like I was watching he was watching one of the podcasts

2593
03:59:24.08 --> 03:59:29.52
and it was one of heavy podcasts which I guess doesn't really narrow it down too much but

2594
03:59:29.52 --> 03:59:33.44
he's he goes walking the podcast and all of a sudden there's a big advertisement on you know what

2595
03:59:33.44 --> 03:59:38.80
and this is what youtube will do sometimes with longer videos they'll just put that over as far as angry

2596
03:59:39.44 --> 03:59:44.32
and you know what it was in youtube comments which we know we don't respond to but we do read

2597
03:59:45.04 --> 03:59:52.40
but I almost responded bro 99 99 that thing's gone yeah I was watching

2598
03:59:52.40 --> 04:00:00.56
that's some serious for a full chat right there is bro it is he's it is he's he's he's he's he's

2599
04:00:00.56 --> 04:00:05.60
but it was going great and then the commercial popped out was starting to check into my life I'm never

2600
04:00:05.60 --> 04:00:14.000
going to park again man I think I think the ads I get it though you know because sometimes you

2601
04:00:14.000 --> 04:00:18.40
leave your listening to his deal his thing whatever it is he's talking about it takes you mentally

2602
04:00:18.40 --> 04:00:23.92
and kind of emotionally this face it emotionally into a certain spot and then it fades out into

2603
04:00:23.92 --> 04:00:28.32
some hey do you want to I don't know whatever the ad is you know you want to get more kind of

2604
04:00:28.32 --> 04:00:34.64
put some breaks on that there's been some of my new little things in the podcast especially for

2605
04:00:34.64 --> 04:00:39.84
echo I'll say echo's been very and we didn't talk about it because it was actually not the right

2606
04:00:39.84 --> 04:00:45.76
time to talk about it but on the last podcast 122 there was an emotional moment for echo

2607
04:00:45.76 --> 04:00:52.24
and you got through it I know I know I'm like super hardcore and everyone knows that you know but

2608
04:00:52.24 --> 04:00:58.56
hey man you know even stronger moments of fatigue no one I was maybe just fatigue that time anyway

2609
04:00:59.36 --> 04:01:06.80
good or ways to support is subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes Stitcher google play

2610
04:01:08.24 --> 04:01:13.04
in any other place where be you listen to your podcast new podcast apps all over now

2611
04:01:13.04 --> 04:01:18.24
so boom subscribe no shame can't keep up on them yeah and when I say no shame that's not a

2612
04:01:18.24 --> 04:01:22.08
in white or actually here's something a little interesting thing start super interesting it's kind

2613
04:01:22.08 --> 04:01:27.76
of interesting you know the expression no shame right it usually means like by this guy has no shame

2614
04:01:27.76 --> 04:01:32.88
like he's kind of like he's he has his moral standards maybe kind of low something like that right

2615
04:01:32.88 --> 04:01:40.32
in white no shame means don't be shy so like in South Africa when I was in South Africa they say

2616
04:01:40.32 --> 04:01:45.20
shame it's just a word that they use for all kinds of different things and they're not shame

2617
04:01:45.84 --> 04:01:50.40
okay yeah it's it's I like the way they used it interesting yeah and I'll try and bring it back

2618
04:01:51.20 --> 04:01:55.92
yeah I'm telling you right now with those two pieces of information right I'm prepared to change

2619
04:01:57.28 --> 04:02:01.68
you know it'll help me in case you get a guy from white he says no shame he will he doesn't

2620
04:02:01.68 --> 04:02:05.84
mean it in a bad way because it's they're very subtle differences but one is kind of on the bad

2621
04:02:05.84 --> 04:02:10.48
side like oh this guy no shame you know this guy no shame if a whole guy from white says no shame

2622
04:02:10.48 --> 04:02:15.92
is he's just saying don't be shy or if he's telling the story say a this person wasn't shy at that

2623
04:02:15.92 --> 04:02:22.000
point like like if he says and here it is here's the example okay I'm telling the story about a guy

2624
04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:27.36
who went and talked to a girl and said this guy no shame he just went and talked to her on the

2625
04:02:27.36 --> 04:02:31.52
mainland or you know outside of white whatever they'd be like wait what was wrong with it was

2626
04:02:31.52 --> 04:02:35.04
that his friends girlfriend or something what was that his cousin or something you know I mean

2627
04:02:35.04 --> 04:02:39.68
so it sounds like a whole different story so he can do that on in text message there then

2628
04:02:40.24 --> 04:02:46.72
if it's a white guy you can more people say problems yeah well well when you may not know

2629
04:02:46.72 --> 04:02:54.40
the point the if he could probably do it because he is very proactive and aggressive in his use of

2630
04:02:54.40 --> 04:03:02.48
emojis this guy yeah rainbows shockers like we've all he brings it yeah I incorporate the palm

2631
04:03:02.48 --> 04:03:07.68

2666
04:06:18.88 --> 04:06:24.40
channel the reason I put it on a separate channel is so that your kids aren't sitting there streaming

2667
04:06:24.40 --> 04:06:31.12
podcasts or your kid podcast and all of a sudden they jump into the shitty season yeah

like that ask you the questions they're questions they probably ask their parents yeah

2673
04:07:01.44 --> 04:07:05.52
you seem to have maybe the parents would be like oh I'm not sure yeah maybe or okay i'll just kind

2765
04:17:05.60 --> 04:17:07.76
