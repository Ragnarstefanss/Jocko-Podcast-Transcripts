00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 217 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.24
echo. Good evening. The chaplain wanted me to visit one family in particular. They were

3
00:00:18.24 --> 00:00:25.24
caring for their severely wounded service member, a marine master sergeant named Eden Pearl,

4
00:00:25.24 --> 00:00:32.24
who had been part of the Marine Corps forces, special operation command marsawk.

5
00:00:32.24 --> 00:00:38.24
I've met a lot of severely wounded vets by then, but the severity and extent of Eden's wounds

6
00:00:38.24 --> 00:00:46.24
set him in a category by himself. His family, especially his wife, Alicia,

7
00:00:46.24 --> 00:00:52.24
remained some of the strongest, most courageous people I've ever met.

8
00:00:52.24 --> 00:01:03.24
Eden was muscular, tattooed, and once sported a bushy red beard, they called him the Viking.

9
00:01:03.24 --> 00:01:13.24
Other Marines knew him as an exemplary combat leader. He served in Kosovo from 1999 to 2001,

10
00:01:13.24 --> 00:01:21.24
helping to prevent ethnic cleansing. In 2003, he was one of the first Marines on the ground in Iraq.

11
00:01:21.24 --> 00:01:31.24
He redeployed to Iraq in 2004 and 2005, then deployed to Afghanistan in 2009.

12
00:01:31.24 --> 00:01:37.24
In August of 2009, Eden and his unit were involved in a massive gun battle against terrorists

13
00:01:37.24 --> 00:01:42.24
in the area surrounding a small Afghan village.

14
00:01:42.24 --> 00:01:48.24
The battle rage so intensely that the Marines made the difficult decision to leave the village

15
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:53.24
so they could return it a more strategic time.

16
00:01:53.24 --> 00:02:02.24
As they left the Humvee that Eden wrote in, struck a hidden roadside, IED, exploded,

17
00:02:02.24 --> 00:02:10.24
and burst into flames. The interpreter and the driver, Army Corporal Nick Rausch,

18
00:02:10.24 --> 00:02:17.24
were killed immediately. The remaining four troops inside the vehicle received severe burns,

19
00:02:17.24 --> 00:02:22.24
but non-as-terrible as Eden.

20
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:30.24
Here's the remarkable thing. Eden was finally pulled from the vehicle and placed under a burn blanket.

21
00:02:30.24 --> 00:02:35.24
Still coherent.

22
00:02:35.24 --> 00:02:42.24
The first thing he did was ask if his troops were okay.

23
00:02:42.24 --> 00:02:48.24
The family asked me if I'd go into the intensive care unit for a while to sit with Eden.

24
00:02:48.24 --> 00:02:58.24
I nodded and a nurse fitted me with a gown, gloves and booties and placed a nylon hat over my hair.

25
00:02:58.24 --> 00:03:03.24
The family stayed outside while the nurse led me in.

26
00:03:03.24 --> 00:03:13.24
All was quiet in the ICU. My footsteps made no sound as I approached the Marine in the bed.

27
00:03:13.24 --> 00:03:21.24
I stood for a moment, taking in what I saw.

28
00:03:21.24 --> 00:03:28.24
Eden was burned on more than 90% of his body and was covered by bandages.

29
00:03:28.24 --> 00:03:38.24
Burn gel covered any exposed area of his skin. His eyes were slightly open with burn gel covering his face.

30
00:03:38.24 --> 00:03:45.24
He'd suffered a traumatic brain injury and was missing both legs and one arm.

31
00:03:45.24 --> 00:03:55.24
I'd seen many, many badly wounded service members by then, but Eden was the most severely wounded I'd ever met.

32
00:03:55.24 --> 00:04:00.24
He did not move.

33
00:04:00.24 --> 00:04:05.24
The nurse whispered to me that they weren't exactly sure what Eden could hear or comprehend,

34
00:04:05.24 --> 00:04:11.24
but they were fairly sure some messages were getting through.

35
00:04:11.24 --> 00:04:17.24
I drew a closer to Eden and told him that he wasn't alone.

36
00:04:17.24 --> 00:04:20.24
That his family was there with him.

37
00:04:20.24 --> 00:04:32.24
That they loved him and cared for him deeply, and that as a country, we were immensely grateful to him for his service.

38
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:49.24
After I finished speaking Eden's eyelids flickered, once twice, the only movement he'd made since I walked into the room.

39
00:04:49.24 --> 00:04:55.24
Over the next year, I would reach out to the hospital, Chaplin to receive updates about Eden.

40
00:04:55.24 --> 00:05:01.24
But the Chaplin eventually moved to another assignment, and I lost touch.

41
00:05:01.24 --> 00:05:08.24
Then in 2012, I did an event in Chicago for the Marine Corps, law enforcement foundation.

42
00:05:08.24 --> 00:05:13.24
A Chicago police officer started talking with me about a severely wounded Marine he knew.

43
00:05:13.24 --> 00:05:19.24
And before he named the man, I said, wait, I know who you're talking about, Eden Pearl.

44
00:05:19.24 --> 00:05:21.24
Please tell me what you know about him.

45
00:05:21.24 --> 00:05:24.24
Where is he?

46
00:05:24.24 --> 00:05:31.24
The police officer put me in touch with Eden as a battle buddy, Marine Phil Noblen, a Florida resident.

47
00:05:31.24 --> 00:05:41.24
I called Phil, and he explained how Eden had moved around the country from convalescent home to convalescent home, his family always with him.

48
00:05:41.24 --> 00:05:46.24
Phil put me in touch with Eden's wife, and we talked and caught up.

49
00:05:46.24 --> 00:05:53.24
I told her about the home building initiative for wounded veterans that we had going by then.

50
00:05:53.24 --> 00:06:05.24
We talked through a few specifics of the program, then I simply said, it would be in my honor if you would let us do that for you and Eden.

51
00:06:05.24 --> 00:06:15.24
Phil Noblen had raised some money to help, so I asked Phil to use those funds to purchase land in San Antonio, not far from the Brook Army Medical Center burn unit.

52
00:06:15.24 --> 00:06:22.24
And my foundation built Eden and his family, especially adapted smart technology home.

53
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:28.24
To see part of the immense burden lifted off his wife and family was gratifying.

54
00:06:28.24 --> 00:06:40.24
Over the next few years in that place of respite his wife and family helped Eden live a quiet life as they wanted.

55
00:06:40.24 --> 00:06:49.24
Eden received all the help he could and never stop fighting.

56
00:06:49.24 --> 00:06:57.24
His sacrifices were enormous, and I respect Eden and his family tremendously.

57
00:06:57.24 --> 00:07:16.24
In 2015 at age 40, after a long six-year fight for healing, Eden Pearl passed away.

58
00:07:16.24 --> 00:07:22.24
He will never be forgotten.

59
00:07:22.24 --> 00:07:32.24
He will never be forgotten.

60
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:46.24
90% 90% of his body burned.

61
00:07:46.24 --> 00:08:05.24
He was lost in both legs, lost in one arm, traumatic brain injury and a brutal six-year battle.

62
00:08:05.24 --> 00:08:19.24
And it's hard to even call that.

63
00:08:19.24 --> 00:08:34.24
But the sacrifices family made.

64
00:08:34.24 --> 00:08:45.24
A sacrifice that we must never forget.

65
00:08:45.24 --> 00:08:58.24
Now, sometimes people ask me how they can serve if they were never in the military.

66
00:08:58.24 --> 00:09:07.24
Then I always tell people that there are countless ways to serve without actually being in the military.

67
00:09:07.24 --> 00:09:18.24
And I have one such person here who is not served in the military but does everything in his power to help our American service men and women.

68
00:09:18.24 --> 00:09:20.24
And first responders as well.

69
00:09:20.24 --> 00:09:27.24
And the piece that I just read about Eden Pearl is from his book.

70
00:09:27.24 --> 00:09:30.24
And the book is called Greatful American.

71
00:09:30.24 --> 00:09:49.24
And the man that wrote it is Gary Sunnis, an actor, founder of a world-renowned theater company, a bass player in a rock and roll band, and a true caring patriot.

72
00:09:49.24 --> 00:10:04.24
And we are lucky enough to have him here to tonight, to discuss his life and the lessons that he's learned in life with us.

73
00:10:04.24 --> 00:10:08.24
So, Gary, thank you for coming on by.

74
00:10:08.24 --> 00:10:10.24
That's great to be here, Jack.

75
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:12.24
Thank you for having me.

76
00:10:12.24 --> 00:10:25.24
There's multiple stories that you tell in the book about some of these wounded warriors that you've had the honor of meeting and seeing in these horrible situations.

77
00:10:25.24 --> 00:10:32.24
And that one right there, when you start talking about somebody that, you know, when you get a burn on your finger.

78
00:10:32.24 --> 00:10:40.24
When you burn your finger on the stove and you have a tiny burn on your finger, that's painful and it's annoying.

79
00:10:40.24 --> 00:10:47.24
And you could say, okay, well, can you imagine if that was my whole finger or my whole hand?

80
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:54.24
You get to a point where you're talking about 90% of your body. I mean, it's, it's, you cannot fathom that.

81
00:10:54.24 --> 00:10:56.24
You cannot fathom that.

82
00:10:56.24 --> 00:11:09.24
And that idea, you know, one of the most horrible things that these roadside bombs do is when they go off,

83
00:11:09.24 --> 00:11:17.24
they deform the vehicles because the explosion just, you know, the torques, the vehicles so hard.

84
00:11:17.24 --> 00:11:27.24
That a lot of times the vehicles, the doors, just like on a car door and a car accident, you hear about the, the fire fighters showing up and the doors don't work anymore.

85
00:11:27.24 --> 00:11:33.24
Well, the same thing happens in armored vehicles, except for you can't break the windows either because they're both approved.

86
00:11:33.24 --> 00:11:38.24
And then they catch on fire. It's a, it's a nightmare.

87
00:11:38.24 --> 00:11:58.24
Um, but yeah, so as I read through some of those things, man, it was, um, tough to read and definitely, I appreciate you sharing those stories of what you've seen up close and personal with everyone.

88
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:03.24
So that everyone can kind of understand or at least not understand, but at least get some,

89
00:12:03.24 --> 00:12:13.24
some idea of the sacrifices that are made by our, our service members across the board.

90
00:12:13.24 --> 00:12:16.24
Well, thank you.

91
00:12:16.24 --> 00:12:28.24
Now, you're road to, you know, writing this book and actually the road of your life, the journey that you've been through has been,

92
00:12:28.24 --> 00:12:34.24
it's, I mean, um, it's very interesting. I'll just put it that way. It's very interesting.

93
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:45.24
And, uh, I can imagine, um, that as you, as you started writing this book, you know, you're, you're thinking yourself, well,

94
00:12:45.24 --> 00:12:54.24
what's this stuff going to sound like? Now that you're writing it, you know, in the past, going back whatever 30, 40, 50 years in the past of when you were a kid,

95
00:12:54.24 --> 00:12:59.24
I talk a lot on this podcast about the dumb things I did as a kid.

96
00:12:59.24 --> 00:13:05.24
I, I haven't had the courage yet to document them as you have done here.

97
00:13:05.24 --> 00:13:12.24
And so, uh, I think it's interesting, but it's, but, but I think what's powerful about it is,

98
00:13:12.24 --> 00:13:19.24
look, anybody that didn't do dumb things when they were a kid, you know, they don't exist, I don't think, right?

99
00:13:19.24 --> 00:13:27.24
And, and so, but seeing, you know, how you grew and how you learned over those years, it's pretty, it's pretty impressive.

100
00:13:27.24 --> 00:13:34.24
Well, I, you know, I didn't know what the book was going to be called or exactly what it was going to be when I started.

101
00:13:34.24 --> 00:13:46.24
I knew I wanted, I was encouraged to, um, document, um, the, um, military support,

102
00:13:46.24 --> 00:13:56.24
because I've been all over the world and been, you know, engaged with our military for so long and been to so many places and everything,

103
00:13:56.24 --> 00:14:05.24
uh, some, some folks, agent and, and whatnot, and courage me to consider writing some of that down.

104
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:13.24
And, and I eventually kind of accepted, well, them, you know, I, I could probably try to do that.

105
00:14:13.24 --> 00:14:18.24
But then I thought, you know, well, how did I get to that point where I'm doing all this stuff?

106
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:22.24
What was, what were the steps along the way that kind of led to it?

107
00:14:22.24 --> 00:14:27.24
And, and, and, I couldn't have predicted that I would go all the way back before birth, you know,

108
00:14:27.24 --> 00:14:34.24
and, and, and, and, to, to getting to that, but I ended up doing that because I, I started to trace my own family history.

109
00:14:34.24 --> 00:14:44.24
And some of the, some of the things that had happened along the way for my own family, especially on my father's side of the family, the Italian side of the family.

110
00:14:44.24 --> 00:14:50.24
And, uh, coming over, you know, through Ellis Island and all of that settling in Chicago.

111
00:14:50.24 --> 00:14:52.24
And, uh, is this veto Sanisi?

112
00:14:52.24 --> 00:14:53.24
Is this veto Sanisi?

113
00:14:53.24 --> 00:14:54.24
Is this veto Sanisi?

114
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:55.24
Yeah.

115
00:14:55.24 --> 00:14:56.24
My great grandfather.

116
00:14:56.24 --> 00:15:01.24
And, uh, the, the stories, and I didn't know, you know, I only knew so much.

117
00:15:01.24 --> 00:15:11.24
So I, I actually started researching my own family and it became kind of fascinating and interesting to me to kind of retrace those steps and learn about things.

118
00:15:11.24 --> 00:15:23.24
Um, and I wanted to, I wanted to set that up because my grandfather, my father's father was, uh, when I was younger, he, he had, uh, you know, he had served in World War I.

119
00:15:23.24 --> 00:15:34.24
And I remember as a kid seeing all the stuff in the basement, you know, but the kind of scary grandfather would never talk about any of that stuff or anything like that.

120
00:15:34.24 --> 00:15:40.24
And I was a little bit frightened from my big Italian gangster like grandfather.

121
00:15:40.24 --> 00:15:48.24
And it was later after he passed away and things that I talked to his sons, my dad a little bit more about him and learned about him.

122
00:15:48.24 --> 00:15:56.24
And he had three sons, they were all in the service to in World War II, uh, and my dad served in the Navy during Korea.

123
00:15:56.24 --> 00:16:13.24
And I just started thinking, okay, well, these, these individuals do play a part in my journey to this service work because, as I've gotten more into the service work, I've explored the veterans of my own family, a lot deeper.

124
00:16:13.24 --> 00:16:26.24
And things that I never knew as a kid or never even thought about considered, you know, by the time I was old enough to kind of absorb anything that they had done during their service years.

125
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:41.24
They were well beyond those years, you know, my uncle was a banker and my other uncle, World War II uncle was a writer, living in Texas, and my dad was a film editor, and they, none of them ever talked about anything in the service.

126
00:16:41.24 --> 00:16:44.24
So I started wanting to know a lot more.

127
00:16:44.24 --> 00:16:52.24
And what, when was that? When did you start, was that when you started researching this book or this is just in your, no, no, it was, when he's, or 30, something like that?

128
00:16:52.24 --> 00:17:02.24
Well, it was actually, uh, probably when I really started to ramp up on supporting our veterans and that, I wanted to know more about the veterans and my own family.

129
00:17:02.24 --> 00:17:13.24
And both my son, the family and my wife, side of the family. So they play an important part in setting the stage for the book. And, and then I realize the book is a journey.

130
00:17:13.24 --> 00:17:27.24
It's a, it's a journey from this kind of self-focused, Gary focused on, you know, my theater company, my acting thing and wanting to become, you know, successful in all that.

131
00:17:27.24 --> 00:17:36.24
To this broader focus of service to others. And so that's why the subtitles are journey from self-to-service.

132
00:17:36.24 --> 00:17:47.24
You, you, you know, you're mentioning what your, what your, uncles did and your dad, but like, during World War II, going back to the book, during World War II,

133
00:17:47.24 --> 00:17:54.24
Uncle Jack flew 30 missions as a navigator and a B-17 bomber over Europe. While Uncle Jerry had just 18 years old served on a US Navy ship.

134
00:17:54.24 --> 00:18:00.24
In the Pacific arriving just after the battle for Okinawa ended in mid June 1945.

135
00:18:00.24 --> 00:18:07.24
I mean, first of all, being on a B-17 bomber over Europe, your chances of survival are not good.

136
00:18:07.24 --> 00:18:09.24
Not good. Not good.

137
00:18:09.24 --> 00:18:17.24
Yeah, we lost half the half the soldiers, half the service members were, that were lost in World War II were lost in the air.

138
00:18:17.24 --> 00:18:22.24
You know, a lot of times when I meet people that aren't in the military, they say, tell me, I grew up in a military family.

139
00:18:22.24 --> 00:18:32.24
Did you get that feeling or what is it so far in the past for your uncles and stuff that one was a banker and your dad was in film and they just didn't talk about it or did you feel it?

140
00:18:32.24 --> 00:18:43.24
No, I didn't. No, they never talked about it. I, I, I so wish my grandfather would have, you know, I would have been aware enough at the time to talk to him about World War I.

141
00:18:43.24 --> 00:18:54.24
And he drove an ambulance and during the battle of the Argonne in World War I, that's, that's, we've never lost as many service members in one battle as that.

142
00:18:54.24 --> 00:19:02.24
It was devastating and he was faring our wounded back and, you know, away from the front lines back to the rear and then go back again.

143
00:19:02.24 --> 00:19:07.24
And Germans would try to take out the ambulances and it was very dangerous.

144
00:19:07.24 --> 00:19:14.24
He survived that. He was like 17 years old, away was doing that. And yet I never talked to him about it.

145
00:19:14.24 --> 00:19:20.24
But I do remember trunks in the basement with stuff, you know, from World War I.

146
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:32.24
Thankfully, the uncle that I mentioned who was in the Pacific, who became a writer and lived in Texas, he wrote about his dad.

147
00:19:32.24 --> 00:19:39.24
And he interviewed his dad and he tried to get his dad to talk about it. And he said he wouldn't talk much, but he shared certain things.

148
00:19:39.24 --> 00:19:44.24
And some of those things I got from my uncles writing that I'd put in the book about my grandfather.

149
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:51.24
Yeah, I always have to make this disclaimer that although I read big chunks of the book, I don't read the whole book here.

150
00:19:51.24 --> 00:19:59.24
And so to get all those little details, you, you need to get the book. So go get the book.

151
00:19:59.24 --> 00:20:06.24
I mean, I mean, these are turbulent times, kind of the beginning of the turbulent times.

152
00:20:06.24 --> 00:20:12.24
Candidates killed, uh, 1964.

153
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:21.24
Back to the book. For Christmas, I received my first guitar acoustic. I had no idea how to play, but I loved it.

154
00:20:21.24 --> 00:20:31.24
The Beach Boys had become my favorite band. My first record was Beach Boys concert, a live record, and as the songs, spawn on my record player.

155
00:20:31.24 --> 00:20:40.24
I love to hear the crowd cheering in the background. So you go out and you make your own band called the Beach Dweller's.

156
00:20:40.24 --> 00:20:43.24
Which I guess in Chicago, you got Beach in Chicago, I guess.

157
00:20:43.24 --> 00:20:47.24
Right, I like Michigan. Right.

158
00:20:47.24 --> 00:20:54.24
And I look like you focused on that pretty well, but on the other hand, we got this. Every report card, I brought home stunk.

159
00:20:54.24 --> 00:21:00.24
This has been going on since first grade reading and writing didn't come easy to me.

160
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:04.24
Uh, you say, my future lay in either music or sports.

161
00:21:04.24 --> 00:21:10.24
I could have tossed a coin. I loved sports in Highland Park. I played baseball, he's spring, winters.

162
00:21:10.24 --> 00:21:15.24
They'd freeze over the parking lot of my school when we played hockey as a huge black hoax fan.

163
00:21:15.24 --> 00:21:19.24
And Bobby Hollis, my favorite player. I also love football. And moving for the bears.

164
00:21:19.24 --> 00:21:21.24
The bears.

165
00:21:21.24 --> 00:21:25.24
We organized a local football league for kids and played each other on the weekends.

166
00:21:25.24 --> 00:21:29.24
I was a fast runner, always the quarterback or one of the halfbacks.

167
00:21:29.24 --> 00:21:33.24
I usually got the kickoff return guy running for a touchdown.

168
00:21:33.24 --> 00:21:41.24
Every chance I got. I played football through eighth grade in Glen Allen, but I was an undisciplined kid.

169
00:21:41.24 --> 00:21:47.24
I never showed up for practice. So I never knew any of the plays. The coaches would just put me in to return the kickoff because of my speed.

170
00:21:47.24 --> 00:21:49.24
And nine times out of ten, I'd get a touchdown.

171
00:21:49.24 --> 00:21:57.24
When I reach high school at Glen Bard West in 1969, I tried out for the team, but realized every kid was twice as motivated as me.

172
00:21:57.24 --> 00:22:02.24
Twice as big and twice as big. So that end to my football career.

173
00:22:02.24 --> 00:22:06.24
That left me music and dreams of being a rock star.

174
00:22:06.24 --> 00:22:12.24
And I figured musicians all needed to be hard part of yours. Right? Woodstock, rock and roll.

175
00:22:12.24 --> 00:22:17.24
My parents like to entertain and kept a bar stock with various bottles of liquor.

176
00:22:17.24 --> 00:22:21.24
At the end of eighth grade, I decided to experiment. I had a metal box with a latch on it.

177
00:22:21.24 --> 00:22:26.24
So I gathered empty peanut butter jars with lids, cleaned them out, and stashed them in my box.

178
00:22:26.24 --> 00:22:30.24
When no one was looking, I sneaked small amounts of liquor out of my parents' bar.

179
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:32.24
Whiskey into one jar, vodka into another.

180
00:22:32.24 --> 00:22:34.24
Vermouth into another.

181
00:22:34.24 --> 00:22:37.24
Always just a bit, so mom and dad didn't notice.

182
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:40.24
One Saturday night, I decided it was time.

183
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:45.24
Randy and I shared a bedroom, but there was a small attic room connected to our room.

184
00:22:45.24 --> 00:22:48.24
That was private where we kept some of my music gear.

185
00:22:48.24 --> 00:22:52.24
When Randy was asleep, I went to the attic room with my metal box full of jars.

186
00:22:52.24 --> 00:22:58.24
Shut the door behind me and taste it. The vodka, the whiskey, the vermouth, the gin, the wine.

187
00:22:58.24 --> 00:23:03.24
Next thing I knew I was plastered, sick as a dog, puking into my metal case.

188
00:23:03.24 --> 00:23:06.24
Everything I'd eaten for the past month.

189
00:23:06.24 --> 00:23:11.24
My head spun, and I wanted to lie down somewhere, but thought I'd be better to clean out the box.

190
00:23:11.24 --> 00:23:16.24
So no one would find out what I'd been up to. I bobbed and weaved down the front stairs, heard the TV on the other room.

191
00:23:16.24 --> 00:23:20.24
Fidget the coast was clear, crept into the kitchen, started dumping the vomit into the kitchen sink.

192
00:23:20.24 --> 00:23:25.24
I was dizzy and nauseous, and as I looked up, suddenly my mother was standing next to me.

193
00:23:25.24 --> 00:23:29.24
Her arm is folded. She looked puzzled and concerned and angry at the same time.

194
00:23:29.24 --> 00:23:35.24
Oh, hello, mother, I said in my sugary voice, I'm just cleaning out my box. It was a little messy. How are you this evening?

195
00:23:35.24 --> 00:23:39.24
The room started to go dark and I realized I was passing out.

196
00:23:39.24 --> 00:23:42.24
Next thing I knew, mom and dad were wiping off my mouth, putting me to bed.

197
00:23:42.24 --> 00:23:48.24
I was grounded for a week and no more box. You'd think I would have learned my lesson, but that was just the start for me.

198
00:23:48.24 --> 00:23:52.24
The times were changing and the drug culture began to rise.

199
00:23:52.24 --> 00:24:01.24
America was exploding in a million different directions just as I entered my teen years, and it felt like the entire country couldn't contain itself.

200
00:24:01.24 --> 00:24:04.24
We were at the peak of the Vietnam War, and it was going badly.

201
00:24:04.24 --> 00:24:09.24
We found ourselves in the age of revolution.

202
00:24:09.24 --> 00:24:17.24
Everybody was anti-authority, anti-establishment. I heard about Woodstock, the sexual revolution.

203
00:24:17.24 --> 00:24:26.24
The pop was everywhere, and by the end of eighth grade, although I was still on the football team, I felt copied between the athletes and the pot smokers.

204
00:24:26.24 --> 00:24:30.24
For a couple of years, I went crazy.

205
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:36.24
So there you go. Get some. Young Gary.

206
00:24:36.24 --> 00:24:41.24
Yeah. So that's, so 1969, you're in eighth grade?

207
00:24:41.24 --> 00:24:47.24
Yeah. Eighth grade, and that was my freshman year as well. So you finished eighth grade?

208
00:24:47.24 --> 00:24:50.24
You were a little too young to be worried about the draft at that point.

209
00:24:50.24 --> 00:24:52.24
Or were you thinking about it? No.

210
00:24:52.24 --> 00:24:53.24
I'm worried about it.

211
00:24:53.24 --> 00:24:56.24
But this was the height of the Vietnam War.

212
00:24:56.24 --> 00:24:57.24
Oh yeah.

213
00:24:57.24 --> 00:25:02.24
For the eighth, 1969, and 70. So there was all the stuff was going on.

214
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:09.24
All the protesting and all the riots on college campuses and all of that was going on.

215
00:25:09.24 --> 00:25:13.24
Yet I was still kind of on the young side.

216
00:25:13.24 --> 00:25:33.24
I do remember, and I write about in this book, they would have things like more atoriums and the more atoriums were on the high school campuses and college campuses and people would just not go to class and they'd sit around and somebody would speak and they'd wear black arm bands and somebody had a guitar and playing.

217
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:36.24
And you were protesting the war.

218
00:25:36.24 --> 00:25:45.24
So I thought as a freshman, and if you told them you were doing that, you told your teacher you were doing that.

219
00:25:45.24 --> 00:25:48.24
You would be excused. They would give you a break.

220
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:51.24
So I thought, well that's a good thing to do.

221
00:25:51.24 --> 00:25:53.24
I'm going to get out of class.

222
00:25:53.24 --> 00:25:55.24
That was a big political motivation.

223
00:25:55.24 --> 00:26:01.24
I went, my big political motivation was getting out of class and maybe there's some girls at the protest.

224
00:26:01.24 --> 00:26:06.24
So I went and sat there. I couldn't tell you what was said or anything like that.

225
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:09.24
I was just out of class and I didn't have to go.

226
00:26:09.24 --> 00:26:18.24
In fact, I looked at the yearbook from those years and they had a picture of one of those protests.

227
00:26:18.24 --> 00:26:23.24
Everybody sitting around and guitars, playing and protesting the war with black arm bands.

228
00:26:23.24 --> 00:26:27.24
I'm probably in the crowd somewhere there. I couldn't find myself.

229
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:29.24
But you weren't thinking about the draft really?

230
00:26:29.24 --> 00:26:32.24
No. No.

231
00:26:32.24 --> 00:26:37.24
I mean, I imagine when your eighth grade is like a 13, 14 years old.

232
00:26:37.24 --> 00:26:42.24
Three or four years away seems like the rest of the time it's like an eternity.

233
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:45.24
Like you're never going to get there. So why would I be worried about what's going to happen in four years?

234
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:49.24
I wasn't even though even the Vietnam war was on television all the time.

235
00:26:49.24 --> 00:26:55.24
It was on every night that the casualty reports were on all the time.

236
00:26:55.24 --> 00:27:04.24
I was happening. My parents were fearful that I was going to get drafted because they were drafted and everybody.

237
00:27:04.24 --> 00:27:08.24
And especially the kids who were failing in school.

238
00:27:08.24 --> 00:27:09.24
And that was me.

239
00:27:09.24 --> 00:27:10.24
Where I was here.

240
00:27:10.24 --> 00:27:22.24
And I thought, my mom was terribly frightened that I would probably get plucked out of school because I was so bad and go have to go to war or something.

241
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:42.24
So I wasn't, you know, it was only later that I really started to analyze those years and how oblivious I was to what was happening to young people just slightly older than I was in the jungles of Vietnam.

242
00:27:42.24 --> 00:27:53.24
And then it hit me. You know, a lot of sort of guilt and shame for how oblivious I had been and how I wasn't really paying attention.

243
00:27:53.24 --> 00:28:07.24
So that I think was galvanizing in some way in terms of taking on, taking action, taking on the charge to help our veterans.

244
00:28:07.24 --> 00:28:14.24
Because I go back to the Vietnam War days. I graduated.

245
00:28:14.24 --> 00:28:21.24
My class was in 1973 and that was the end of the draft that year.

246
00:28:21.24 --> 00:28:27.24
So I remember having a register for a selective service, but the draft was over.

247
00:28:27.24 --> 00:28:34.24
So my parents, you know, breathes, I relieved and I wasn't going to get drafted.

248
00:28:34.24 --> 00:28:52.24
But it was only just a few years later that, you know, after I met the woman who would become my wife whose two brothers served in Vietnam and her sister joined the army met a Vietnam veteran who served in the army for 22 years.

249
00:28:52.24 --> 00:29:03.24
It was after I met them that things started to change for me. I started to really look back at those years and go, you know, I should have been more.

250
00:29:03.24 --> 00:29:10.24
Pay attention more to what was going on in the country with our service members. But I was a kid.

251
00:29:10.24 --> 00:29:22.24
Yeah, that's it's interesting too that you know, because even though you said you didn't feel like you were from a military family, even though you absolutely were from a military family.

252
00:29:22.24 --> 00:29:27.24
It's interesting that, you know, your parents.

253
00:29:27.24 --> 00:29:41.24
They're you didn't connect those dots, right? Like, hey, my uncle Jack was in the army he was using the army air core. He flew B-17s and a lot of those, you know, a lot of his friends must have died and wait a second. What's going on now? It's just.

254
00:29:41.24 --> 00:29:43.24
And never thought about it.

255
00:29:43.24 --> 00:29:45.24
Exactly. Exactly.

256
00:29:45.24 --> 00:29:47.24
But because they never talked about it.

257
00:29:47.24 --> 00:29:53.24
My uncle was a banker. He wasn't a world where two heroes, you know, until later.

258
00:29:53.24 --> 00:30:01.24
I really spent a lot of time in my uncle Jack and then he and then he talked and he would talk about his experiences a lot.

259
00:30:01.24 --> 00:30:04.24
I took him to the National War where two of museum.

260
00:30:04.24 --> 00:30:14.24
We recorded him on video where he's preserved at the World War II museum. I took him to Memorial Day in DC in this and that.

261
00:30:14.24 --> 00:30:24.24
I spent a lot of time with my uncle Jack in the last 10, 12 years of his life. And he talked a lot about his, his war days up to a point.

262
00:30:24.24 --> 00:30:32.24
And then then you knew like he wouldn't go beyond this place. He would never let him go into an emotional place.

263
00:30:32.24 --> 00:30:35.24
Never let himself go there.

264
00:30:35.24 --> 00:30:39.24
Because I could tell he was, he was getting close to something like this.

265
00:30:39.24 --> 00:30:49.24
I saw a lot of bad stuff. I mean, his own plane barely made it over the English channel one time. One engine and they were about 500 feet off the channel.

266
00:30:49.24 --> 00:30:57.24
And they crashed on the, you know, the in Britain and they all survived.

267
00:30:57.24 --> 00:31:05.24
But he saw he saw a lot of planes go down around him in flames and just crash in everywhere.

268
00:31:05.24 --> 00:31:17.24
And some bad stuff. He saw a lot of bad stuff up there. But he went up mission after mission after mission, you know, 30 missions survived.

269
00:31:17.24 --> 00:31:24.24
There's one story in the book where he swaps. He was an navigator and he swaps with a buddy.

270
00:31:24.24 --> 00:31:30.24
The buddy said, hey, you know, can you take this, this mission with my crew. I got to go do something.

271
00:31:30.24 --> 00:31:44.24
And I don't know for whatever reason they swam. And he was with a guy named Don Casey and so, and he was an navigator as well. So my uncle Jack said, sure, you go with this mission.

272
00:31:44.24 --> 00:31:47.24
Sure enough, plane gets shot down.

273
00:31:47.24 --> 00:31:57.24
All the guys, a band in ship and Don Casey gets captured and spends 18 months in a German prison camp until he escapes.

274
00:31:57.24 --> 00:32:08.24
And they were best friends and, you know, for their whole life. And Don always took the opportunity to remind me.

275
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:11.24
I like he was a switch mission.

276
00:32:11.24 --> 00:32:15.24
You know, it was just as fate would have.

277
00:32:15.24 --> 00:32:23.24
Yeah. Well, it's interesting that with all that going on, how it just shows you how easy it is for, especially in America.

278
00:32:23.24 --> 00:32:36.24
So easy to disconnect from the realities of war, right? And for people to be, you know, going to Starbucks and drinking a coffee when there's guys that are fighting right right at this moment in time.

279
00:32:36.24 --> 00:32:39.24
And it's so easy in this country to be disconnected from that.

280
00:32:39.24 --> 00:32:50.24
It's one of the, it's one of the things, one of the things I like about your book is you bring that connection back together to explain to the people in the civilian world that, hey, just kind of FYI.

281
00:32:50.24 --> 00:33:05.24
This stuff's going on. You know, you know, jacco, that's, that's one of the ways I found that I can be useful. You know, I've got a public platform as an actor.

282
00:33:05.24 --> 00:33:14.24
There's, there's a, you know, a forum with which I can talk to people and tell them things that I've seen and whatnot.

283
00:33:14.24 --> 00:33:30.24
And I really want to, to do something to help. So I found the way that I can do that is to try to bridge that disconnect between the average citizen who doesn't may not have a military person in their family or know anybody who's even serving in the military.

284
00:33:30.24 --> 00:33:33.24
Try to help them understand what our military does.

285
00:33:33.24 --> 00:33:40.24
How exceptional they are, the sacrifices that are made, all those things. I just found that that was the way that I could help.

286
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:43.24
Yeah, and it's huge, it's huge.

287
00:33:43.24 --> 00:33:50.24
And I'm glad that you ended up in this very nice place, but I'm going to take it right back to your juvenile delinquent child.

288
00:33:50.24 --> 00:33:54.24
You know, it is entertaining.

289
00:33:54.24 --> 00:34:04.24
I close out the last part saying for a couple of years, I went crazy and you just kind of, you know, you do and you talk about some of the crazy stuff you were doing.

290
00:34:04.24 --> 00:34:10.24
One of your buddies had a, some kind of a music store. You went in there. You know, he had the key. You guys stole some speakers.

291
00:34:10.24 --> 00:34:23.24
You brought him back to your house. I mean, just, and anyway, you described this. You say, I'd become a thief, an allire and a near-failing student and as a 14 year old, I couldn't care less about any of it.

292
00:34:23.24 --> 00:34:33.24
And that's kind of the setup for this next chapter that you roll into, which is, interestingly, it's called baptism.

293
00:34:33.24 --> 00:34:45.24
I'm going to, I'm going to go to the book here a little bit. I was a soft form played lead guitar in a new band and me the bass player and the drummer all slouched against the wall in the glass hall.

294
00:34:45.24 --> 00:34:56.24
Part of your school. We called ourselves half day road after stretch of highway that divided our two northern Chicago suburbs, Highland Park and Highwood.

295
00:34:56.24 --> 00:35:02.24
We thought we were the real stuff more than anything. I just wanted to fit in at this new school and jam with my new band.

296
00:35:02.24 --> 00:35:11.24
But the life I hoped for was all about the change. She walks straight toward us. A teacher named it Mrs. Barbara Patterson.

297
00:35:11.24 --> 00:35:23.24
She was a powerhouse of a gal, a tornado of a woman, blonde hair, set jaw, the power of poetry running through her veins. She slowed when she neared us stopped and gave a diminutive sniff.

298
00:35:23.24 --> 00:35:34.24
Our clothes were cool and raggy and my band makes an eye all wore scruffy jackets. I'd let my hair grow crazy and curly. It sprung out horizontally in a wild mass of thicket.

299
00:35:34.24 --> 00:35:45.24
Mrs. Patterson was the theater teacher. She looked at us and said, I'm directing west side story for the spring play. You guys look like you play gang members.

300
00:35:45.24 --> 00:35:56.24
Coming on edition for the play. It sounded like more of a dare than a request than she was often walking fast on a way down the hall. We shrugged and laughed at all in one of us scoffed. Who cares about please?

301
00:35:56.24 --> 00:36:09.24
You kind of end up just kind of doing it. I would say just out of, hey, we got nothing better to do. We'll go in and maybe you had some curiosity in the back of your head, but you sign up to do an audition.

302
00:36:09.24 --> 00:36:19.24
And they post the, I don't know what's it called. What's it called? What did they post the casting? The casting.

303
00:36:19.24 --> 00:36:31.24
So here we go. Next morning in the hallway near the drama department, a list was posted. Everyone crowded to look me too. I scan down the list way way down.

304
00:36:31.24 --> 00:36:40.24
I kept scanning but didn't recognize any of the names well who cares. I thought but kept reading my eyes kept scanning down scanning down toward the very end.

305
00:36:40.24 --> 00:36:43.24
When I saw this a soft light came on inside my soul.

306
00:36:43.24 --> 00:36:47.24
Peppy. Is that right. Peppy. Peppy.

307
00:36:47.24 --> 00:36:52.24
To be played by Gary Sinis.

308
00:36:52.24 --> 00:37:01.24
How many lines does Peppy have? Peppy has a couple of words. Okay. Yeah. No couple of words. I don't even call him lines. Okay. Well, that's something.

309
00:37:01.24 --> 00:37:06.24
But I was in the gang. I was, you know, it's the sharks and that sharks and that. Everybody knows West Side story.

310
00:37:06.24 --> 00:37:15.24
And I was one of the sharks. So you go on here. I'd come to high school and fall into a pattern of smoking dope, skipping class, smoking more dope.

311
00:37:15.24 --> 00:37:26.24
All the while trying to find friends just another kid caught up in the American craziness. There wasn't much going. There wasn't much to hold us together. And this is this I could go off tan generally on this forever.

312
00:37:26.24 --> 00:37:37.24
But you're talking about basically about America. There wasn't much to hold us together. Culture. That was changing morals. What were they? This was 1971 religion.

313
00:37:37.24 --> 00:37:47.24
My mom, my family stopped going to church when I was a little kid and we weren't raised with any sort of faith. Nothing to provide an anchor as a family as a nation. These were tough times.

314
00:37:47.24 --> 00:37:55.24
Most days I was floating on the open sea every evening images of the Vietnam war splashed across the TV screens.

315
00:37:55.24 --> 00:38:07.24
So yeah, it's kind of wild times. And you're at a party and there's some guy and it's it's I actually picked up on this immediately when I read it.

316
00:38:07.24 --> 00:38:15.24
You describe some guy that's in there and some guy at the party and you how do you describe it's actually kind of funny.

317
00:38:15.24 --> 00:38:30.24
He looks like he's older like someone's older brother and he wants to buy some pop from you and you sell it to him and as it turns out big surprise he's a cop.

318
00:38:30.24 --> 00:38:34.24
You get a call from one of your friends dude the police rated the party.

319
00:38:34.24 --> 00:38:45.24
I'm in with a real show of forest rounder everybody up what are you talking about. I said then it clicked the dog catcher wasn't lying about what he did for a living it was just slang he worked for the city alright police department and I'd sold pot to the dog catcher.

320
00:38:45.24 --> 00:38:53.24
I was the source of weed yeah my friend my friends voice dropped on the phone and they're looking for you.

321
00:38:53.24 --> 00:39:06.24
And you know what this is I mean pot is a crime I mean 10 years ago in America I mean we live in California maybe wasn't that big of a crime and but that you know it was a crime certainly in 1971.

322
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:21.24
Oh yeah I mean that could be jail time without it that right yeah it was there there was a whole juvenile department at the police headquarters at the police station.

323
00:39:21.24 --> 00:39:36.24
But just to go after young kids that were abusing themselves with drugs and the head of that was a guy that I'm right about in here and that they called officer rash.

324
00:39:36.24 --> 00:39:53.24
And officer rash led this raid and the dog catcher said well the guy who sold me the pot left right before the rate. So but but all these people know who he is so they started asking everybody involved I was so scared.

325
00:39:53.24 --> 00:40:07.24
Can you imagine that now that this buddy calls me up and he says they've rated the house and they're looking for you and you're the you're the big drug poster you know and so I I ended up getting on a train.

326
00:40:07.24 --> 00:40:23.24
He had lived in the town Glen Allen the year before and then we moved back to this town Island park and the raid was in Island park so I got on the train and went out to Glen Allen to hide out I was on the land you know.

327
00:40:23.24 --> 00:40:37.24
Finally I came back and told my parents what happened and we they drove me to the police station and I turned myself in and turn myself in the lights were blaring you know.

328
00:40:37.24 --> 00:40:53.24
I was just crying and you know I cried and crying but the main thing there is I had just gotten into this play wet side story and I've got some words to deliver.

329
00:40:53.24 --> 00:41:15.24
I was fearful that they were going to pull me out send me to like a juvenile home or something bus me really bus me and I begged the police officer to let me off the hook because I just discovered this new thing that I think you know is going to change my life and I will and it did.

330
00:41:15.24 --> 00:41:25.24
I was going to turn everything around for me being in this play and all of a sudden you know I can't say that I didn't smoke pot anymore anything like that but.

331
00:41:25.24 --> 00:41:41.24
I found this thing that I was good at I was a terrible student as I said and I was struggling all the time and really. I was probably near being kicked out of school at the time at this thing and this incident with the police.

332
00:41:41.24 --> 00:41:45.24
Was that just a regular public school or was the private this is a regular public school.

333
00:41:45.24 --> 00:41:59.24
You know big school I mean like 2500 students at the high school so it was pretty big big school but it had a wonderful theater department and this this teacher that I mentioned there was just she changed my whole life.

334
00:41:59.24 --> 00:42:17.24
Barb Riches are standing in a hallway we've all had moments where something happens or an individual walks into our lives that we didn't see coming. And the course of our lives just changes you know and we go this way and that's what happened there standing in that hallway.

335
00:42:17.24 --> 00:42:24.24
She sent me right to the theater world and from that moment on I never stopped doing it.

336
00:42:24.24 --> 00:42:38.24
You guys you do four shows of west side story and the last show you know you obviously get better each time and the fourth show you know you guys crush it and here we go.

337
00:42:38.24 --> 00:42:51.24
Back to the book the lights came down the audience burst into applause as one of the sharks. I was part of the gang that carried Tony's dead body off stage. We sharks set the body down behind the curtain and Tony came to life again.

338
00:42:51.24 --> 00:42:59.24
That's just good old Jeff Perry a high school kid who is quickly becoming one of my best friends Jeff gave me a huge hug and I burst into tears.

339
00:42:59.24 --> 00:43:17.24
And in the glorious pandemonium off stage everybody was hugging and slapping each other on the back with no chance to blow away the snap because it was time for curtain call out in the auditorium the audience continued their applause cheering shouting whistling their congratulations and all the supporting players and chorus members came out on stage and a pack including me.

340
00:43:17.24 --> 00:43:29.24
And you know the the the ensemble and all the gang members kind of get their applause and then the leads go out the leads took their bows together I still hung far in the back sobbing harder than ever.

341
00:43:29.24 --> 00:43:35.24
My eyes scrunch tight against the tears then in the midst of all the commotion I felt the hand of my shoulder I opened my eyes.

342
00:43:35.24 --> 00:43:41.24
It was a hand of Jeff Mill Mill Voynes and I said that right Jeff Mill Voy.

343
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:49.24
Jeff the senior Bernardo the shark he reached back grabbed me pulled me up toward the front of the pack where the six leads stood.

344
00:43:49.24 --> 00:43:55.24
He shouted in my ear to take a bow with all the leads so I did me the sophomore screw up still balling my eyes out.

345
00:43:55.24 --> 00:44:00.24
I stood out the front of the pack with any audience was still standing still applauding cheering for us.

346
00:44:00.24 --> 00:44:10.24
I took one long glorious look around trying to wipe my nose with my sleeve and we all bowed again all together and I suddenly realized I'd fallen in love with this new community of students.

347
00:44:10.24 --> 00:44:14.24
With this new life of theater who's almost too much to take in.

348
00:44:14.24 --> 00:44:19.24
The entire cast it's seen who I was before the plan what had happened to me during those five weeks.

349
00:44:19.24 --> 00:44:24.24
Now I had so many new friends it was powerful something had really changed for me.

350
00:44:24.24 --> 00:44:27.24
I was going forward again. I had been baptized.

351
00:44:27.24 --> 00:44:31.24
My life of purpose had begun.

352
00:44:31.24 --> 00:44:34.24
You were crying.

353
00:44:34.24 --> 00:44:36.24
What what emotion is that?

354
00:44:36.24 --> 00:44:42.24
Well it was it was it was very because the play was over.

355
00:44:42.24 --> 00:44:49.24
And I didn't want it to be over. I didn't want it to end. It had changed my life so completely.

356
00:44:49.24 --> 00:44:57.24
And introduced me to a new community in the school and I just wanted as much of it as I could get.

357
00:44:57.24 --> 00:45:00.24
And now it was over. The show was over.

358
00:45:00.24 --> 00:45:03.24
And my heart was kind of broken.

359
00:45:03.24 --> 00:45:08.24
And so I was sobbing at the end of the thing.

360
00:45:08.24 --> 00:45:14.24
And the whole cast kind of, you know, on this with my first play I never done it before.

361
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:18.24
A lot of the kids have been in plays and part of the theater department.

362
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:20.24
They were used to it and this and that.

363
00:45:20.24 --> 00:45:24.24
But here comes this kid who's just kind of messed up and really struggling.

364
00:45:24.24 --> 00:45:31.24
Nearly kicked out of school and I discovered this new world and they recognized that.

365
00:45:31.24 --> 00:45:34.24
And it was really emotional.

366
00:45:34.24 --> 00:45:36.24
That was really quite quite beautiful.

367
00:45:36.24 --> 00:45:43.24
And you know people ask me quite often, you know what what are some of the top things you've done in your career.

368
00:45:43.24 --> 00:45:49.24
And you know the movies and you know what are the pinnacles and everything like that.

369
00:45:49.24 --> 00:45:52.24
And they're several good good things that I've done.

370
00:45:52.24 --> 00:46:00.24
But among the top things I always this part with two words is always at the top of the world.

371
00:46:00.24 --> 00:46:09.24
Because it was the first thing, you know, it's the first moment that I discovered this thing that would be what I would do for my life.

372
00:46:09.24 --> 00:46:13.24
West Side Story 72 who wants something.

373
00:46:13.24 --> 00:46:23.24
Well, when I was reading this I was trying to, I'm trying to put what I'm reading into something in my own mind trying to relate it to things that I understand.

374
00:46:23.24 --> 00:46:34.24
And the other day we did a podcast about a guy, young British guy that was ended up in World War II, but in 1937 he joins the British army.

375
00:46:34.24 --> 00:46:39.24
And he goes in this little paragraph about how they went out and did parade.

376
00:46:39.24 --> 00:46:46.24
And they did the entire 20 minute presentation of of course order drill with no commands.

377
00:46:46.24 --> 00:46:51.24
So it's just silent until the last thing they give one command and everyone else keeps someone command.

378
00:46:51.24 --> 00:46:58.24
And you can, you know, he talks just a couple sentences about this incredible pride that he had.

379
00:46:58.24 --> 00:47:08.24
That he was part of this group, right, that had drilled and trained and practiced to get ready for this particular moment.

380
00:47:08.24 --> 00:47:11.24
And I was thinking, okay, well, that's what you have here, right?

381
00:47:11.24 --> 00:47:20.24
Well, that guy was a young kid that joined the army because the civilian life didn't have much to offer him as a 16 year old British kid in tough times.

382
00:47:20.24 --> 00:47:26.24
And here you are, tough times, young kid, and all of a sudden this group is there.

383
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:31.24
And you've got to practice and train to get ready to do this presentation.

384
00:47:31.24 --> 00:47:36.24
Then you do it and the big difference is in this one, you're allowed to kind of express your emotions.

385
00:47:36.24 --> 00:47:39.24
And on top of that, the crowd can express their emotions.

386
00:47:39.24 --> 00:47:45.24
And so you get this whole thing and I started realizing, okay, so here's what that's what's going on.

387
00:47:45.24 --> 00:47:54.24
It's a very similar thing. You got, you became part of this for lack of a better word, but it opens up a whole new category of thinking.

388
00:47:54.24 --> 00:47:56.24
You became part of this gang, right?

389
00:47:56.24 --> 00:48:03.24
This gang of friends and just like this guy, red skirt, us became a part of this gang of troopers, soldiers.

390
00:48:03.24 --> 00:48:05.24
You became a part of this gang.

391
00:48:05.24 --> 00:48:14.24
The other thing that I realized about it, and it's what you say, you don't use the same words as I use because I spent my entire adult life in the military.

392
00:48:14.24 --> 00:48:18.24
But you all have a sudden to add a mission.

393
00:48:18.24 --> 00:48:21.24
You know, you had a mission. Like, oh, here's this thing.

394
00:48:21.24 --> 00:48:23.24
You know what happened to me when I was 18 years old?

395
00:48:23.24 --> 00:48:25.24
I joined the Navy.

396
00:48:25.24 --> 00:48:27.24
And that was became my mission.

397
00:48:27.24 --> 00:48:31.24
All of a sudden, all the dumb things that I did, which thankfully I haven't had to write about,

398
00:48:31.24 --> 00:48:33.24
all those dumb things didn't matter anymore.

399
00:48:33.24 --> 00:48:34.24
And all of a sudden I just had a mission.

400
00:48:34.24 --> 00:48:37.24
And I was part of now part of a gang.

401
00:48:37.24 --> 00:48:40.24
And then the more I stayed in the Navy and the further I went along,

402
00:48:40.24 --> 00:48:44.24
the tighter the gang got and the more focused I got on the mission.

403
00:48:44.24 --> 00:48:49.24
So I think there's some element of that when someone, you know,

404
00:48:49.24 --> 00:48:52.24
I always say to veterans when they get out.

405
00:48:52.24 --> 00:48:55.24
You know, because veterans going to get out, they can get lost.

406
00:48:55.24 --> 00:48:57.24
They lose their way because they don't have a mission anymore.

407
00:48:57.24 --> 00:49:01.24
And so I'm always saying, hey, find a new mission, find a new mission, find a new mission.

408
00:49:01.24 --> 00:49:05.24
But if you just take that to a 1314 year old kid, well 1314 year old kid,

409
00:49:05.24 --> 00:49:10.24
doesn't have a mission and the interesting thing is a 1314 year old kid.

410
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:15.24
They might not have a mission but they have energy and they have talent and they have potential.

411
00:49:15.24 --> 00:49:18.24
And if you don't harness that stuff and point it somewhere,

412
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:19.24
well then guess what it does.

413
00:49:19.24 --> 00:49:21.24
It steals booze from its parents.

414
00:49:21.24 --> 00:49:23.24
It steals speakers from its neighbors.

415
00:49:23.24 --> 00:49:25.24
And you know, that's what it does.

416
00:49:25.24 --> 00:49:29.24
You take that energy and if you can focus it somewhere, all of a sudden it turns good.

417
00:49:29.24 --> 00:49:31.24
And I got one more friend of mine named Scott.

418
00:49:31.24 --> 00:49:35.24
And you know, we were all raised in our kids kind of together.

419
00:49:35.24 --> 00:49:39.24
And you know, we'd be talking about what what it is, how you make your kid

420
00:49:39.24 --> 00:49:45.24
not stray off into the bad tendencies that people can go down.

421
00:49:45.24 --> 00:49:49.24
And he said, you know, I just want my kids to be really into something.

422
00:49:49.24 --> 00:49:51.24
And I thought that's a good point.

423
00:49:51.24 --> 00:49:58.24
And whether it's surfing or skateboarding or shooting bows or juditsu or acting,

424
00:49:58.24 --> 00:50:00.24
whatever it's going to be, if you get that kid with a mission,

425
00:50:00.24 --> 00:50:04.24
all of a sudden it keeps him on somewhat of a good path.

426
00:50:04.24 --> 00:50:06.24
Of course, something positive.

427
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:08.24
Exactly. Exactly.

428
00:50:08.24 --> 00:50:11.24
And each one of those things, by the way, you know, you, I mean,

429
00:50:11.24 --> 00:50:14.24
every one of those things, there's subcultures, you know,

430
00:50:14.24 --> 00:50:16.24
you can be in a music scene and be a total, you know,

431
00:50:16.24 --> 00:50:19.24
you can get sucked into drugs, rock and roll, right?

432
00:50:19.24 --> 00:50:22.24
The acting scene I'm sure can suck you down that path.

433
00:50:22.24 --> 00:50:26.24
Surfing for sure, there's been, there's plenty of

434
00:50:26.24 --> 00:50:31.24
sad stories along the path of, of that course, right?

435
00:50:31.24 --> 00:50:34.24
So anything you can get sidetracked on, especially

436
00:50:34.24 --> 00:50:37.24
that comes with a little taste of, of fame, right?

437
00:50:37.24 --> 00:50:39.24
Famine ego.

438
00:50:39.24 --> 00:50:42.24
So you get on this path, though.

439
00:50:42.24 --> 00:50:47.24
And you get, you don't do great in school.

440
00:50:47.24 --> 00:50:49.24
And by the time, here we go back to the book.

441
00:50:49.24 --> 00:50:52.24
There I was class of 73, the end of my senior year,

442
00:50:52.24 --> 00:50:54.24
all my friends graduated except me.

443
00:50:54.24 --> 00:50:57.24
I didn't have enough credits. I'd ace all my theater classes,

444
00:50:57.24 --> 00:50:59.24
but bombed everything else, so I needed to return

445
00:50:59.24 --> 00:51:02.24
September for one additional semester.

446
00:51:02.24 --> 00:51:05.24
I felt like a failure.

447
00:51:05.24 --> 00:51:10.24
So, you know, that's, that's got a suck.

448
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:12.24
I remember that was hard.

449
00:51:12.24 --> 00:51:13.24
Yeah.

450
00:51:13.24 --> 00:51:17.24
And then you say this in January 1974, I finally graduated from high school.

451
00:51:17.24 --> 00:51:21.24
Today if people ask, I just laugh and tell them I was part of the class of

452
00:51:21.24 --> 00:51:24.24
1973 and a half. College was not my radar.

453
00:51:24.24 --> 00:51:27.24
I just wanted to keep doing plays with these pals of mine.

454
00:51:27.24 --> 00:51:31.24
So with two friends who were still in high school, Rick,

455
00:51:31.24 --> 00:51:35.24
Argosh, Rick Argosh and Leslie Wilson.

456
00:51:35.24 --> 00:51:37.24
We gathered some other kids.

457
00:51:37.24 --> 00:51:40.24
We got to know, we knew and we got read to do a show.

458
00:51:40.24 --> 00:51:43.24
My parents knew the architects of the unitarian church and

459
00:51:43.24 --> 00:51:45.24
deer field with a big open space.

460
00:51:45.24 --> 00:51:48.24
I asked them to ask the church folks if they would let us do a play down there.

461
00:51:48.24 --> 00:51:50.24
And they said, yes, we started rehearsing a play called

462
00:51:50.24 --> 00:51:53.24
and miss Reardon drinks a little.

463
00:51:53.24 --> 00:51:57.24
A complex comedy about three middle-aged sisters who face their problems

464
00:51:57.24 --> 00:51:59.24
after the death of their mother.

465
00:51:59.24 --> 00:52:02.24
Since everyone was still in school except me,

466
00:52:02.24 --> 00:52:04.24
we rehearsed after school hours and into the night.

467
00:52:04.24 --> 00:52:07.24
It felt great to be working on a play again in our own little space

468
00:52:07.24 --> 00:52:09.24
and idea that was almost all our own doing.

469
00:52:09.24 --> 00:52:12.24
During rehearsals, we got ready to print programs.

470
00:52:12.24 --> 00:52:16.24
And I said, okay, we need to call this out fit something.

471
00:52:16.24 --> 00:52:18.24
We threw out all kinds of names.

472
00:52:18.24 --> 00:52:21.24
Rick was reading a Herman Hass novel called Stepan Wolf.

473
00:52:21.24 --> 00:52:24.24
And while everyone was making suggestions,

474
00:52:24.24 --> 00:52:25.24
he didn't say anything.

475
00:52:25.24 --> 00:52:29.24
He just held up his novel and pointed to it and said,

476
00:52:29.24 --> 00:52:32.24
and I said, great, Rick, let's put that on the program.

477
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:34.24
I hadn't read it, but it sounded good.

478
00:52:34.24 --> 00:52:36.24
Stepan Wolf theater company.

479
00:52:36.24 --> 00:52:37.24
We needed to print programs.

480
00:52:37.24 --> 00:52:39.24
Quickly, so Stepan Wolf it was.

481
00:52:39.24 --> 00:52:42.24
I felt so hopeful about what we were doing.

482
00:52:42.24 --> 00:52:45.24
Excited to think we're creating a company.

483
00:52:45.24 --> 00:52:48.24
I pulled a few books together,

484
00:52:48.24 --> 00:52:52.24
boxed together to buy a rubber stamp with Stepan Wolf and described on it.

485
00:52:52.24 --> 00:52:54.24
And stamped our name everywhere we could.

486
00:52:54.24 --> 00:52:59.24
Stamp, stepan Wolf, stamp, stepan Wolf, stamp, stepan Wolf.

487
00:52:59.24 --> 00:53:03.24
None of us grasped yet.

488
00:53:03.24 --> 00:53:06.24
What none of us grasped yet was the magnitude of the moment

489
00:53:06.24 --> 00:53:08.24
when Stepan Wolf was named.

490
00:53:08.24 --> 00:53:11.24
We couldn't see what we couldn't see was a bigger future

491
00:53:11.24 --> 00:53:13.24
than any of us could imagine.

492
00:53:13.24 --> 00:53:16.24
Something that would last for decades and is still going strong today.

493
00:53:16.24 --> 00:53:20.24
The Stepan Wolf theater company of Chicago.

494
00:53:20.24 --> 00:53:23.24
Pretty big moment.

495
00:53:23.24 --> 00:53:27.24
Pretty big branding moment.

496
00:53:27.24 --> 00:53:30.24
Now did you guys, did you know the band Stepan Wolf you had to?

497
00:53:30.24 --> 00:53:32.24
Yes, I played some of their songs.

498
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:38.24
And you didn't think that was kind of encroaching on their style?

499
00:53:38.24 --> 00:53:40.24
Like I said, we were looking at the book.

500
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:44.24
We weren't thinking about the band. We just looked at the book.

501
00:53:44.24 --> 00:53:49.24
And it's the book.

502
00:53:49.24 --> 00:53:53.24
It's like the conflict.

503
00:53:53.24 --> 00:53:55.24
It's the dichotomy.

504
00:53:55.24 --> 00:53:56.24
Right?

505
00:53:56.24 --> 00:53:57.24
dichotomy.

506
00:53:57.24 --> 00:53:59.24
Yes, the dichotomy.

507
00:53:59.24 --> 00:54:01.24
People always accuse me and rightfully self

508
00:54:01.24 --> 00:54:03.24
that being possibly my favorite word.

509
00:54:03.24 --> 00:54:09.24
Yes, the dichotomy of the kind of spiritual high-minded part of the world.

510
00:54:09.24 --> 00:54:12.24
Part of you as a human being.

511
00:54:12.24 --> 00:54:17.24
And then the other part, which is the wolf of the Step, which is on in German,

512
00:54:17.24 --> 00:54:21.24
does Step in Wolf.

513
00:54:21.24 --> 00:54:25.24
But that's kind of cool because this is what's kind of talking at humans.

514
00:54:25.24 --> 00:54:26.24
Right?

515
00:54:26.24 --> 00:54:30.24
And the thing that when I was saying earlier that, like, I kind of,

516
00:54:30.24 --> 00:54:34.24
I don't know if we were recording yet, but the thing that I kind of relate,

517
00:54:34.24 --> 00:54:36.24
like when I was a kid, we all had bands.

518
00:54:36.24 --> 00:54:39.24
And it was just a hard-corn punk rock.

519
00:54:39.24 --> 00:54:41.24
And it was everything was kind of DIY.

520
00:54:41.24 --> 00:54:44.24
That was the mindset.

521
00:54:44.24 --> 00:54:46.24
The mindset was, we're doing this ourselves.

522
00:54:46.24 --> 00:54:49.24
Like, oh, the man doesn't want to support us cool.

523
00:54:49.24 --> 00:54:50.24
We'll do what we're doing this ourselves.

524
00:54:50.24 --> 00:54:51.24
I still have that attitude.

525
00:54:51.24 --> 00:54:52.24
I started my own publishing company.

526
00:54:52.24 --> 00:54:53.24
Why?

527
00:54:53.24 --> 00:54:55.24
Because I didn't like what my publisher said about something.

528
00:54:55.24 --> 00:54:56.24
I was like, cool.

529
00:54:56.24 --> 00:54:57.24
I got this.

530
00:54:57.24 --> 00:54:58.24
Watch this.

531
00:54:58.24 --> 00:54:59.24
If I had my own publishing company.

532
00:54:59.24 --> 00:55:04.24
You know, so that attitude, it's pretty cool that you guys had this attitude of,

533
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:07.24
like, you know, you know, you're going to start a theater company.

534
00:55:07.24 --> 00:55:08.24
We're going to, you know, there you go.

535
00:55:08.24 --> 00:55:10.24
You make the name and you start getting it out there.

536
00:55:10.24 --> 00:55:14.24
And it's been around now for however many years, 40, almost 50 years.

537
00:55:14.24 --> 00:55:15.24
Is that it?

538
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:17.24
Well, it's 46 years.

539
00:55:17.24 --> 00:55:19.24
Yeah.

540
00:55:19.24 --> 00:55:20.24
Yeah.

541
00:55:20.24 --> 00:55:24.24
And, you know, we own several buildings that we built from the ground up.

542
00:55:24.24 --> 00:55:26.24
We're building another one right now.

543
00:55:26.24 --> 00:55:32.24
It's, it really is a great American dream story where you,

544
00:55:32.24 --> 00:55:38.24
where you, you start off with just some kids with kind of a passionate desire to do something.

545
00:55:38.24 --> 00:55:45.24
And it, you know, 46 years later, it's, it's a multi-million-dollar gigantic place.

546
00:55:45.24 --> 00:55:48.24
And lots of great actors come out of there.

547
00:55:48.24 --> 00:55:51.24
And it's, you know, when you, we, we walk in.

548
00:55:51.24 --> 00:55:55.24
I always think about the 18-year-old kid who's in high school who walks in that place.

549
00:55:55.24 --> 00:56:00.24
And it looks at all the, you know, all the pictures and everything.

550
00:56:00.24 --> 00:56:05.24
And it's a giant theater. There's three or four theaters in there, restaurants, everything like that.

551
00:56:05.24 --> 00:56:10.24
And then you can see this picture of 18-year-old kids up there on the wall.

552
00:56:10.24 --> 00:56:15.24
And they, they're like me, you know, they built this thing.

553
00:56:15.24 --> 00:56:21.24
You know, it, it really is an inspirational sort of theater story, I think.

554
00:56:21.24 --> 00:56:25.24
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's not just, it's inspirational theater stories.

555
00:56:25.24 --> 00:56:35.24
It's an inspirational story of what, what human beings, free human beings are capable of executing if they, if they put their mind to it.

556
00:56:35.24 --> 00:56:39.24
Yeah. And in the book, I write about a lot of the early years.

557
00:56:39.24 --> 00:56:40.24
Oh, yeah.

558
00:56:40.24 --> 00:56:43.24
All the struggles, all the ups and downs, all the crazy stuff that happened.

559
00:56:43.24 --> 00:56:45.24
I was going to get away with not talking about it.

560
00:56:45.24 --> 00:56:48.24
I don't know if you want to go through there.

561
00:56:48.24 --> 00:56:52.24
But you see, here eventually we ended up with a total of nine people for our new step in Wolfen's Bay.

562
00:56:52.24 --> 00:56:58.24
Nine are sometimes referred to as the original members, even though the name step in Wolfen already been used since 1974.

563
00:56:58.24 --> 00:57:04.24
The nine original members were John Malkovich, Moira Harris, Nancy Evans, H.E.

564
00:57:04.24 --> 00:57:07.24
Boccus, is that right?

565
00:57:07.24 --> 00:57:17.24
Lori Metcalf, Al Wilder, and the three founders, which is Terry Kinney, Jeffrey Perry, and you Gary Sinese.

566
00:57:17.24 --> 00:57:27.24
And again, just kind of what you were just referring to in the summer of 1976, not everything was so neatly resolved.

567
00:57:27.24 --> 00:57:39.24
As our ensemble was getting wild, trying to get along and learn to work together in those first months of step in Wolfen, things quickly grew messy and complicated as personal life and theater life intertwined.

568
00:57:39.24 --> 00:57:45.24
Moira Harris had particularly caught my eye. She was a brilliant young actor, beautiful passionate full of fire.

569
00:57:45.24 --> 00:57:50.24
I convinced her to date me. We soon fell in love. She was unlike anyone I never met, but I love her.

570
00:57:50.24 --> 00:57:58.24
Wasn't without its ups and downs. We were all over the place in our relationship to passionate personalities on again,

571
00:57:58.24 --> 00:58:03.24
off again, in love, out of love, clinging to each other, mad at each other, breaking up, making up.

572
00:58:03.24 --> 00:58:07.24
You know, I work with business all the time. I believe she had been sold in company.

573
00:58:07.24 --> 00:58:32.24
And getting grown adult educated human beings to resolve problems is challenging. Having these, you know, whatever, nine, 18, 19, 20, 21 year old kids, all of them, you know, with these fiery personalities and passion, it must have been crazy.

574
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:38.24
Not to mention, you mix in, you know, chemicals and whatnot and it gets really crazy.

575
00:58:38.24 --> 00:58:43.24
You go here at one point Terry decided to leave again. And again, I skip a bunch here.

576
00:58:43.24 --> 00:58:48.24
Some of the things that you're talking about, about the craziness, so I skip some of that, but that's why people need to get the book.

577
00:58:48.24 --> 00:58:54.24
At one point Terry decided to leave again, then he wanted back in again. This time we held a meeting to decide if Terry could rejoin.

578
00:58:54.24 --> 00:59:01.24
We all argued and shouted about standing on our principles and being fully committed.

579
00:59:01.24 --> 00:59:16.24
Moira was there and we were still dating. Although, out, really, although a relationship was constantly up and down, often on, her father was dying of cancer then and all the chaos and stress, the meeting prompted Moira to boil over her passion turned to fury and she lost it.

580
00:59:16.24 --> 00:59:22.24
I mean, absolutely lost it, started yelling, how can we not let our friend back in the company? My father is dying and all this is so stupid.

581
00:59:22.24 --> 00:59:31.24
If we're a company, then we're a company and we should stay together no matter what. She ran out of the basement into the grassy yard of the school yelling at the top of her lungs. We all ran out in the yard after her.

582
00:59:31.24 --> 00:59:40.24
Her logic made sense. Terry was our friend. Moira's dad was dying. Terry wanted back in the company. Why do we care so passion about something so trivial in life and death issues were all around us?

583
00:59:40.24 --> 00:59:44.24
Moira was still screaming and crying. We grabbed hold of her and hung on neighbors.

584
00:59:44.24 --> 00:59:57.24
Poke their head out of doorways. She screamed and screamed and the commotion grew so loud the police showed up. Moira calm down. The police left. We all felt bad for Moira, bad for Terry and we ended the meeting. Of course Terry was back in the company.

585
00:59:57.24 --> 01:00:03.24
He was a founder in our friend and those early days, the drama wasn't limited to the stage.

586
01:00:03.24 --> 01:00:08.24
I don't think any of us knew exactly what we were doing. The basement cocoon we've created.

587
01:00:08.24 --> 01:00:16.24
Gave us a foundation to try anything, do anything, become anything in the freedom of the space allowed us to ultimately to glimpse the world through a wider lens.

588
01:00:16.24 --> 01:00:22.24
All of us were committed to becoming better at what we were doing. And we often mixed and mingled our directing and performing directing.

589
01:00:22.24 --> 01:00:28.24
One play acting in the next, sometimes doing both in those early days, we didn't talk about going to Hollywood or New York or into the be in the movies.

590
01:00:28.24 --> 01:00:32.24
We wanted to do our own thing there in Chicago land.

591
01:00:32.24 --> 01:00:39.24
And I think by being there in the basement isolated, we developed the chip on our shoulder necessary to survive.

592
01:00:39.24 --> 01:00:44.24
We felt like we had a lot of emerging talent and we wanted our work to feel real and raw and fearless.

593
01:00:44.24 --> 01:00:49.24
And we worked hard to keep it deeply rooted in the sheer grit that we had on stage together.

594
01:00:49.24 --> 01:00:53.24
Whether it was true or not, we needed to somehow believe our work was different, unique, special.

595
01:00:53.24 --> 01:00:57.24
It would take some time and effort before anyone tried to branch out beyond our city.

596
01:00:57.24 --> 01:01:06.24
But I think those early days we all felt like we were getting better and stronger and more confident as artists and the sky could be the limit eventually.

597
01:01:06.24 --> 01:01:14.24
What I know today is that our theater benefited from a larger institution, the United States of America.

598
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:23.24
The country of our birth allowed us any number of freedoms that we subconsciously used and enjoyed and benefited from even though we didn't realize it.

599
01:01:23.24 --> 01:01:27.24
We had freedom of speech at step-in-law.

600
01:01:27.24 --> 01:01:30.24
We could express our thoughts and ideas about anything in public or private.

601
01:01:30.24 --> 01:01:33.24
The people around us might disagree or debate or push back.

602
01:01:33.24 --> 01:01:40.24
But when they thought we were being stupid, when they thought we were being stupid, but by no means were we ever stifled in what we said or thought.

603
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:42.24
We exercised freedom to assemble.

604
01:01:42.24 --> 01:01:49.24
We used this sort of freedom of religion, although nothing we did was religious, which was a freedom all its own.

605
01:01:49.24 --> 01:01:54.24
No one forces to address a certain way or talk a certain way, because of their beliefs.

606
01:01:54.24 --> 01:02:05.24
We were free to live or travel anywhere we wanted and we were free to work and he job we wanted so we played in bands and created our own theater and worked in sewers where we found baby raccoons.

607
01:02:05.24 --> 01:02:11.24
We were free to educate ourselves by any means, possible, formal, apractical, and all this freedom led to something.

608
01:02:11.24 --> 01:02:16.24
It allowed us to create and innovate. It allowed us to dream big.

609
01:02:16.24 --> 01:02:20.24
Greatfully it allowed us to be us.

610
01:02:20.24 --> 01:02:24.24
Awesome.

611
01:02:24.24 --> 01:02:30.24
The baby raccoons thing. That's a reference to a job that one of our buddies had.

612
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:38.24
So because we all worked in those early days and I'm describing there, everyone worked day jobs.

613
01:02:38.24 --> 01:02:47.24
And then we would go to the theater. We had this little basement of a Catholic school that the Catholics, it was a closed-down Catholic school.

614
01:02:47.24 --> 01:02:53.24
And they had a basement there that they had used for a teen center.

615
01:02:53.24 --> 01:02:59.24
And some of the guy at the Chamber of Commerce, I went to the Chamber of Commerce and I said,

616
01:02:59.24 --> 01:03:08.24
Did you know any place that the kids could make a theater? He said, well sure. Let's go over here. It was basement in the Catholic school.

617
01:03:08.24 --> 01:03:15.24
And it was perfect. And we built an 88-seat theater in there. So we were in there in this basement.

618
01:03:15.24 --> 01:03:22.24
But we weren't making any money. We were just trying to get people to come see the shows for whatever.

619
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:35.24
And so everybody had day jobs. And the raccoon, the guy worked in the sewer. He was actually kind of a technical guy never did a acting with the company.

620
01:03:35.24 --> 01:03:46.24
But I worked on the loading dock at Neiman Marcus on pack and boxes and kind of the shipping clerk type stuff.

621
01:03:46.24 --> 01:03:55.24
And the guy in the house was a man in the house. And he was a school bus driver for a summer camp.

622
01:03:55.24 --> 01:03:57.24
So I always had to move you to the road.

623
01:03:57.24 --> 01:04:02.24
I always worry about those children. They turned out all right.

624
01:04:02.24 --> 01:04:06.24
And everybody had different jobs. We worked in the day.

625
01:04:06.24 --> 01:04:19.24
And we would go to the theater at night and work into the wee hours in the morning. Everybody go home and get up. Go to their job. Go back to the theater at night. And that's how we did it in those early days.

626
01:04:19.24 --> 01:04:30.24
And the thing that I think is, when you say like you guys weren't thinking about New York, you weren't thinking about Hollywood. You're just thinking about just doing this thing as to the best of your ability.

627
01:04:30.24 --> 01:04:39.24
Yeah, I think the founders of the theater, two of the guys, Jeff Perry and Terry Kenny, they met each other at Illinois State University.

628
01:04:39.24 --> 01:04:47.24
Jeff Perry, as I mentioned, was in West Side Story with me and we became best friends. And then he went to college and I went back to high school.

629
01:04:47.24 --> 01:04:52.24
And he met Terry Kenny and they became best friends. Another great actor.

630
01:04:52.24 --> 01:05:01.24
And so the three of us kind of galvanized our plans to start the theater company and to get the theater company going.

631
01:05:01.24 --> 01:05:11.24
And then that's in Malca, which went to Illinois State University, more of a hair as all those other people that were in that you mentioned there in the original group went to Illinois State.

632
01:05:11.24 --> 01:05:18.24
And then they all moved up to Highland Park, which is where I found the basement of the Catholic school. And we started doing plays in there.

633
01:05:18.24 --> 01:05:29.24
We continued to continue on here a little bit forward. But back to the book more. And I got together as a couple a year after the Vietnam War ended in 1975.

634
01:05:29.24 --> 01:05:33.24
And I started to meet her family members who had served in the US Army.

635
01:05:33.24 --> 01:05:40.24
Moiris, brother, Arthur Harris was a helicopter pilot having flown 800 combat hours in Vietnam.

636
01:05:40.24 --> 01:05:50.24
Moiris oldest brother, boy, Makana. Can I say that right? Makana, Mac Harris had been the Vietnam twice. First is Lieutenant and Platoon leader.

637
01:05:50.24 --> 01:05:56.24
And second is a captain and company commander. He'd received the Silver Star for Galantry and Combat.

638
01:05:56.24 --> 01:06:09.24
Moiris sister Amy went through ROTC in college and went into the Army herself after graduation. She met married a great guy, Jack Triss, who served as a combat medic with the 101st Airborne Division of Vietnam.

639
01:06:09.24 --> 01:06:18.24
Jack earned two bronze stars and two purple hearts. When Arthur came home from Vietnam, he withdrew from things.

640
01:06:18.24 --> 01:06:29.24
And I would see him only on rare occasions when Moiris and I would visit her mother. But from time to time, Mack, Jack and Amy came to visit us in Chicago and would see our plays.

641
01:06:29.24 --> 01:06:35.24
I didn't spend a ton of time with these veterans at first, but any time we got together, we talked about deeper matters.

642
01:06:35.24 --> 01:06:46.24
And as I slowly learned more and more about the people who protected our freedoms, I began to look for ways to give back. In 1976 and 1977, Mack came to see a few of our basement plays.

643
01:06:46.24 --> 01:06:56.24
Whenever he was on lead from assignment as a tactical officer at West Point, I was a pretty ragged kid then with torn up jeans and a t-shirt and lots of hair.

644
01:06:56.24 --> 01:07:02.24
He was spit-shined, strong as an at strong as Atlas and had a deep powerful voice.

645
01:07:02.24 --> 01:07:10.24
He, what are your goals? Mack asked me one day after a show. He wasn't grilling me. I sensed kindness within his roughness.

646
01:07:10.24 --> 01:07:20.24
He was interested in other people's lives and genuinely wanted to know about my goals, but I wasn't sure if he was asking about my goals in life or my designs on his sister.

647
01:07:20.24 --> 01:07:28.24
Possibly he wanted to know where we wanted to go as a theater company. So I described my goals for stepping in what I wanted to make it as big as possible.

648
01:07:28.24 --> 01:07:39.24
I had a conversation, a real conversation. This elite former company commander and me, along here, a American 20 year old with big dreams of all things we connected on the subject of leadership.

649
01:07:39.24 --> 01:07:50.24
In high school at the height of the war, I'd been oblivious to so much of what was happening in Vietnam, yet in the early years of stepping in what I began to form genuine friendships with these military veterans.

650
01:07:50.24 --> 01:07:54.24
They began to open my eyes so much more. The war, I knew the war hadn't gone well.

651
01:07:54.24 --> 01:08:02.24
I remembered casualty reports on the news and knew the reports were grim. But now I was meeting actual veterans who lived there, served there, fought there.

652
01:08:02.24 --> 01:08:09.24
And I knew that many of the Vietnam veterans who returned home hadn't been honored for their service.

653
01:08:09.24 --> 01:08:14.24
I didn't know what to do yet about this, if anything. But I felt something stirring inside of me.

654
01:08:14.24 --> 01:08:30.24
I wanted to be honored needed to be granted. Respect was due. A simple thanks needed to be said. It would take a few years before I figured out any sort of next step. But in the meantime, I had a theater and my was family members and I knew something in our country desperately needed to change.

655
01:08:30.24 --> 01:08:33.24
I would start where I could with step-in-wolf.

656
01:08:33.24 --> 01:08:41.24
And without being able to articulate it in this way yet, I would begin to do my part to give back.

657
01:08:41.24 --> 01:08:54.24
So what I really liked about that, not to say that I'm anything close to a guy like Mac, but when I meet people, right?

658
01:08:54.24 --> 01:09:02.24
Like I'll meet some friend of my daughters or some friend of my sisters, some people that are, whatever.

659
01:09:02.24 --> 01:09:08.24
They're clearly pretty close to a long-haired Gary Sineason, 1975 or whatever.

660
01:09:08.24 --> 01:09:19.24
And I can feel that they're looking at me thinking this some stereotypical image of what I'm going to be like.

661
01:09:19.24 --> 01:09:22.24
And I'll just have a genuine conversation with him.

662
01:09:22.24 --> 01:09:27.24
Because I am genuinely, oh, what do you do? So where are you heading in life?

663
01:09:27.24 --> 01:09:35.24
And I think it's the same way you said, hey, this was what you call this elite former company commander.

664
01:09:35.24 --> 01:09:43.24
And you're having a normal conversation with him. And there's a revelation that, oh, this guy is a person.

665
01:09:43.24 --> 01:09:48.24
This guy is just an on person that, yeah, he's got spit shine and yeah, he's got a high in tight.

666
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:57.24
But he's just a person. And he's going to come and watch our freaking crazy plays in our theater, which, which the plays are kind of crazy.

667
01:09:57.24 --> 01:10:02.24
Some of them are really crazy. I forget, is the one where everyone's naked on stage yet?

668
01:10:02.24 --> 01:10:03.24
Does that one happen yet at this point?

669
01:10:03.24 --> 01:10:13.24
A little bit later. Yeah, that was, yeah, one of the, one of the plays that you guys do is about what are they native proviens?

670
01:10:13.24 --> 01:10:14.24
Is it proviens? What country?

671
01:10:14.24 --> 01:10:23.24
Yeah, down in South America, and it's a small, small tribe living, you know, very remote area of the jungle.

672
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:28.24
So you guys put 25 actors on stage naked.

673
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:34.24
Don't blame it on me. I didn't. That's what the mountain is. So mouth of its decides 25.

674
01:10:34.24 --> 01:10:40.24
And you know what, actually, when I heard that, I was like, okay, you know what, I get it, you know, that they're trying to, you know, break down some barriers.

675
01:10:40.24 --> 01:10:47.24
But then what got me was, you go into the details of that. The fact that this place is really small, it's hot.

676
01:10:47.24 --> 01:10:55.24
And all of a sudden, you're sitting in a small room. And there's only 88 seats. So you got 88 people in the bleachers or whatever in the seats.

677
01:10:55.24 --> 01:11:01.24
And there's 30 people make it on stage. You're almost outnumbered by sweaty naked people.

678
01:11:01.24 --> 01:11:05.24
It wasn't the biggest hit. It wasn't the biggest hit of our early day.

679
01:11:05.24 --> 01:11:08.24
But I can see Mac rolling in there from West Point.

680
01:11:08.24 --> 01:11:11.24
Go, what is my sister doing?

681
01:11:11.24 --> 01:11:13.24
Yeah, no, he didn't see that.

682
01:11:13.24 --> 01:11:14.24
Thank you. Thank you.

683
01:11:14.24 --> 01:11:16.24
Thank you.

684
01:11:16.24 --> 01:11:18.24
Thank you.

685
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:22.24
So we're going to, I cut you off.

686
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:23.24
No, no, no, no.

687
01:11:23.24 --> 01:11:33.24
That, uh, Mac was an interesting guy. Let me just talk to you about, you know, he passed away in 1983 of cancer.

688
01:11:33.24 --> 01:11:37.24
And, uh, but he made a very big impression on me.

689
01:11:37.24 --> 01:11:40.24
And some, you know, I'd never met anyone like him before.

690
01:11:40.24 --> 01:11:47.24
As I said, I had veterans in my own family, but I never really met, you know, West Point graduate,

691
01:11:47.24 --> 01:11:54.24
and I was a two-tour Vietnam veteran. In fact, you know, General Vick Vince Brooks.

692
01:11:54.24 --> 01:11:59.24
I know, I don't know him, but General Mike Scaperotty, right?

693
01:11:59.24 --> 01:12:04.24
These are two, they're newly retired, but they're friends of mine.

694
01:12:04.24 --> 01:12:10.24
And I met them. I met Mike when he was a two star, and I met Vince when he was a one star.

695
01:12:10.24 --> 01:12:13.24
They both went on to earn four stars.

696
01:12:13.24 --> 01:12:24.24
They retired, their final jobs, Vince's last assignment was running Korea, and Scaperotty's was the Supreme Hall I'd Commander in Europe, right?

697
01:12:24.24 --> 01:12:28.24
So both of these guys were at West Point when Mac was there.

698
01:12:28.24 --> 01:12:34.24
And that's why I'm close with them, because when I met them early, early, early on in their star,

699
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:42.24
they said they went to West Point. I said, well, did you happen to know Mac Harris?

700
01:12:42.24 --> 01:12:49.24
And both of them, when I met each of them, their faces lit up, and they started gushing about my brother-in-law.

701
01:12:49.24 --> 01:12:55.24
And how much of an influence he had on them when he was a tack officer at West Point?

702
01:12:55.24 --> 01:13:11.24
So he was a really significant guy, and they actually just about four years ago, 2016, they inducted Mac, and this is 30 years after his death, into the 4th, 11th Hall of Fame.

703
01:13:11.24 --> 01:13:18.24
And you know, Omar Bradley and General Patton, all those kind of people are in the 4th, 11th Hall of Fame.

704
01:13:18.24 --> 01:13:35.24
Because he revolutionized some things in the Army back in the day, back in 1976, 77, and into, you know, 81, 82, 83 when he was final assignment was at 11th, where he rewrote the leadership manual.

705
01:13:35.24 --> 01:13:41.24
And that manual still taught today, and principles that he championed, and he came up with.

706
01:13:41.24 --> 01:13:47.24
And so they thought it was a significant contribution to today's Army, so they put him in the 4th, 11th Hall of Fame.

707
01:13:47.24 --> 01:13:56.24
And this is the guy who came, and, you know, I was a little bit scared of him and everything, but then I got to know him, and he was a lovely, lovely guy.

708
01:13:56.24 --> 01:14:02.24
Just unlike anyone I'd ever met, and he made a big impression on me, and I went to his funeral.

709
01:14:02.24 --> 01:14:05.24
You know, I went to his military funeral.

710
01:14:05.24 --> 01:14:12.24
When he died in 1983, and that was very, very powerful.

711
01:14:12.24 --> 01:14:28.24
And so when, you know, 10 years later when I started working with our wounded and getting more involved in everything like that, all those memories of spending time with this particular individual came flooding back and some pretty significant ways.

712
01:14:28.24 --> 01:14:31.24
And that's why I write about him in the book.

713
01:14:31.24 --> 01:14:35.24
Well, I mentioned to Echo Charles before we started recording before you got here today.

714
01:14:35.24 --> 01:14:40.24
So there's, you're going to see some layers today, because Echo likes to talk about layers, the way things are connected.

715
01:14:40.24 --> 01:14:57.24
We often infuse layers intentionally into things, but we record, we do podcasts about a lot of podcasts about military stuff, and we've covered dozens of military manuals on this podcast.

716
01:14:57.24 --> 01:15:00.24
And I think podcast 172.

717
01:15:00.24 --> 01:15:06.24
We cover FM field manual 22.

718
01:15:06.24 --> 01:15:18.24
You tack 10, which is an earlier edition written in 1951 of leadership for the Army.

719
01:15:18.24 --> 01:15:23.24
So now we get to go back and I will, I will get the newer version.

720
01:15:23.24 --> 01:15:34.24
I'll get the one that Mac wrote, and I'll compare the two and see what things, what lessons he brought, because if you think about it, the reason I picked 1951 was, is post World War II.

721
01:15:34.24 --> 01:15:36.24
So we're talking immediately after World War II.

722
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:39.24
These are the guys that sat down and said, hey, here's what we should be teaching.

723
01:15:39.24 --> 01:15:46.24
So I don't even think they revised it after Korea, but now Macs will be post Vietnam.

724
01:15:46.24 --> 01:15:50.24
So it'll be an interesting study.

725
01:15:50.24 --> 01:16:00.24
And you're right, you know, these guys that, and one thing that I've talked about, I talk about a lot of these manuals when we cover them, is, you know, I'll be saying,

726
01:16:00.24 --> 01:16:04.24
I'll be saying, whoever wrote that, like who wrote that part right there.

727
01:16:04.24 --> 01:16:06.24
That, that right there is solid.

728
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:17.24
That one, and you know, I was used, I sometimes I joke about it being a committee in there that's, there's one guy that's really good and, and, and, and Lieutenant Colonel Pog or Colonel Pog is on the other side saying that we can't say that type of thing.

729
01:16:17.24 --> 01:16:19.24
That'll be offensive to, you know, whatever.

730
01:16:19.24 --> 01:16:24.24
There's always that guy and then there's like the combat vet that's putting it straight.

731
01:16:24.24 --> 01:16:28.24
So now I got a name to go with the combat guy that's putting it straight.

732
01:16:28.24 --> 01:16:30.24
His name is Mac Harris.

733
01:16:30.24 --> 01:16:39.24
Yeah, and, you know, just so you know, he got, he was, his last assignment was, was to rewrite the leadership manual at 11 worth.

734
01:16:39.24 --> 01:16:49.24
That's, and he got a lot of pushback from, from top folks who didn't want to go in the direction that he was taking it.

735
01:16:49.24 --> 01:16:57.24
And he wanted to tell, he wanted to talk about leadership through very personal stories of his,

736
01:16:57.24 --> 01:16:59.24
of history.

737
01:16:59.24 --> 01:17:06.24
And those leadership manuals can be very sort of dry and a little bit technical and just sort of blah, blah, blah.

738
01:17:06.24 --> 01:17:12.24
And Mac tells stories about little wrong top and pick it's charge and all this stuff in there.

739
01:17:12.24 --> 01:17:16.24
And he was getting a lot of pushback on people, but he pushed back himself.

740
01:17:16.24 --> 01:17:23.24
And they, they made, they, you know, publish the leadership manual about a month after he passed away.

741
01:17:23.24 --> 01:17:32.24
And it was finally published and brought to light and they're still using it today at West Point and throughout the army.

742
01:17:32.24 --> 01:17:34.24
Yeah, that's awesome.

743
01:17:34.24 --> 01:17:36.24
Um,

744
01:17:36.24 --> 01:17:41.24
We're going to jump forward a little bit here.

745
01:17:41.24 --> 01:17:46.24
Moira and I made a decision to break from step and wolf move out to Los Angeles.

746
01:17:46.24 --> 01:17:49.24
Your parents had moved out there and live with my parents for a while.

747
01:17:49.24 --> 01:17:52.24
We decided we also decided to get married.

748
01:17:52.24 --> 01:17:55.24
I was going to build and jump in a wedding planning with Moira.

749
01:17:55.24 --> 01:17:59.24
But I could tell something was churning in Moira's mind.

750
01:17:59.24 --> 01:18:02.24
One day shortly and again, I'm skipping around because I can't read this whole book.

751
01:18:02.24 --> 01:18:05.24
People got a bite of book.

752
01:18:05.24 --> 01:18:12.24
One day shortly before the wedding date, Moira told me she planned to fly home to Illinois to spend some time with her mom before coming back for the wedding.

753
01:18:12.24 --> 01:18:16.24
A couple of days after she landed in Chicago, the phone rang Gary, I don't want to get married.

754
01:18:16.24 --> 01:18:19.24
Moira said, I'm not coming back.

755
01:18:19.24 --> 01:18:23.24
What? What? I said she paused and added, I can't do it.

756
01:18:23.24 --> 01:18:26.24
Wait, invitations have gone out. We've got all the food ordered.

757
01:18:26.24 --> 01:18:32.24
I know, but I'm not going to do it. I can't. I just can't.

758
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:36.24
So that's kind of.

759
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:40.24
And you, I mean, that's, uh, that's got to be a big hit.

760
01:18:40.24 --> 01:18:44.24
Oh, you nervous about it too and enough to be like, oh, I guess we're good.

761
01:18:44.24 --> 01:18:49.24
Well, because how will we do it?

762
01:18:49.24 --> 01:18:57.24
There was some, I was more afraid of my mom who was spending the money on the napkins and the tablecloths and things like that than, okay, I accepted it.

763
01:18:57.24 --> 01:19:05.24
You know, I was disappointed, but then I accepted it and we kind of went our separate ways for about a year and a half.

764
01:19:05.24 --> 01:19:12.24
And here we are all these years later back together and we put a married many, many years.

765
01:19:12.24 --> 01:19:17.24
Um, I, I had to talk about this.

766
01:19:17.24 --> 01:19:24.24
And late summer 1979, I found out that Robert Redford was making a big movie called Ordinary People.

767
01:19:24.24 --> 01:19:29.24
And I landed in an audition, but didn't get called back.

768
01:19:29.24 --> 01:19:32.24
How could that be? I was perfect for this role, I thought.

769
01:19:32.24 --> 01:19:35.24
Mr. Redford didn't know what he was missing.

770
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:40.24
The story takes place in Lake Forest, Illinois, right next to Harlan, Highland Park where I grew up.

771
01:19:40.24 --> 01:19:45.24
This is me. I already know this character inside and out. I should be playing this part.

772
01:19:45.24 --> 01:19:53.24
I'd heard all these Hollywood urban myths, like the one where Steven Spielberg climbs over the fence at Universal Studios and gets his start in the film industry.

773
01:19:53.24 --> 01:19:56.24
I thought, hey, I can do that too.

774
01:19:56.24 --> 01:20:00.24
As soon as he sees me, Mr. Redford will cast me.

775
01:20:00.24 --> 01:20:03.24
All I need is for him to see me face to face.

776
01:20:03.24 --> 01:20:15.24
So I sneaked into the Warner Bros. Lot planted myself down in the couch in the office of the casting director Penny Perry and informed the receptionist that I wouldn't leave until I could have an audition with Mr. Redford himself.

777
01:20:15.24 --> 01:20:18.24
The receptionist asked if I had an appointment.

778
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:20.24
I said, no, but explain the story.

779
01:20:20.24 --> 01:20:28.24
The receptionist went and told Penny and Penny came out and asked in a kind, but very flat voice, Gary, what are you doing?

780
01:20:28.24 --> 01:20:33.24
I know I wasn't cast, I said, but I grew up in Highland Park.

781
01:20:33.24 --> 01:20:36.24
I'm perfect for this movie. I need to see Robert Redford.

782
01:20:36.24 --> 01:20:41.24
She's side. Sorry. You are not going to see Robert Redford.

783
01:20:41.24 --> 01:20:45.24
Well, I'm not leaving. I'm going to sit right on this couch until I do.

784
01:20:45.24 --> 01:20:49.24
She crossed her arms. Gary, don't do this.

785
01:20:49.24 --> 01:20:52.24
If you don't get off the couch, I'm going to have to call security.

786
01:20:52.24 --> 01:20:55.24
Please, I grew up right there.

787
01:20:55.24 --> 01:21:00.24
Penny's eyebrows lowered. You auditioned? You didn't get called back.

788
01:21:00.24 --> 01:21:04.24
Leave the building or you will be taken off the lock.

789
01:21:04.24 --> 01:21:08.24
I stared back at her. Sign the hang dog.

790
01:21:08.24 --> 01:21:14.24
Reluctantly, I accepted the fact that Robert Redford would not be meeting Gary Sunnis that afternoon.

791
01:21:14.24 --> 01:21:20.24
I slowly got up utterly defeated left the office and walked out the front of a gate of the studios.

792
01:21:20.24 --> 01:21:25.24
I wasn't doing very well in this town, but thought of heading back to Chicago sounded better and better.

793
01:21:25.24 --> 01:21:29.24
On the way home, I came to the conclusion that had been brewing in me for a while now.

794
01:21:29.24 --> 01:21:31.24
Hollywood hates me.

795
01:21:31.24 --> 01:21:34.24
Timothy Hutton landed the park.

796
01:21:34.24 --> 01:21:41.24
It was his first acting gig since playing a bit role in a movie when he was a kid, plus a few small TV slots on Disney.

797
01:21:41.24 --> 01:21:49.24
Tim had never lived anywhere close to Highland Park, but for his performance in ordinary people, he ended up winning an Oscar.

798
01:21:49.24 --> 01:21:55.24
He was only 20 when he won the youngest male actor to win an Academy Award for best supporting actor.

799
01:21:55.24 --> 01:21:58.24
And I had to admit it.

800
01:21:58.24 --> 01:22:00.24
He was really good.

801
01:22:00.24 --> 01:22:02.24
That's how it goes in Hollywood.

802
01:22:02.24 --> 01:22:09.24
And nope, to this day, I've never met Robert Redford.

803
01:22:09.24 --> 01:22:12.24
Having decided to Hollywood, hey, did me. I started packing up to go in.

804
01:22:12.24 --> 01:22:15.24
So that's a great story of rejection.

805
01:22:15.24 --> 01:22:22.24
Well, that's, that's, you have to learn to live with rejection if you're going to be an actor.

806
01:22:22.24 --> 01:22:27.24
Because it's, you're going to be rejected more often than accepted.

807
01:22:27.24 --> 01:22:31.24
There's more actors than parts.

808
01:22:31.24 --> 01:22:34.24
So how many actors go up for a part?

809
01:22:34.24 --> 01:22:38.24
For one part, hundreds of actors go up and try to get one part.

810
01:22:38.24 --> 01:22:47.24
I went to, uh, I was working with a company up in LA, and I went up to speak to them, and they were located around the corner from a casting, whatever place.

811
01:22:47.24 --> 01:22:57.24
And there's, I, I got show up there, and there's, call it 400 10-year-old kids in this line with their parents.

812
01:22:57.24 --> 01:23:01.24
And I, you know, I go to talk to the company that I'm talking to.

813
01:23:01.24 --> 01:23:02.24
And I'm just talking to executives.

814
01:23:02.24 --> 01:23:05.24
And as a show up there, I'm like, hey, what are we all these people doing here?

815
01:23:05.24 --> 01:23:07.24
And they said, yeah, there's a casting call.

816
01:23:07.24 --> 01:23:14.24
For, you know, obviously for some kids, movie or TV showers or a commercial.

817
01:23:14.24 --> 01:23:16.24
You know, who knows?

818
01:23:16.24 --> 01:23:21.24
So yeah, I was going to say there's more actors than there are people in LA.

819
01:23:21.24 --> 01:23:26.24
Oh, I was rejected a lot in the early days of the Hollywood thing.

820
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:31.24
You know, that was when I was living in California, more of an I had come out.

821
01:23:31.24 --> 01:23:37.24
We broke up, but I stayed for a while and kept trying to audition and get parts.

822
01:23:37.24 --> 01:23:40.24
And whatnot, I was there for about a year and a half.

823
01:23:40.24 --> 01:23:47.24
Never got anything until I made a decision to leave and go back to Chicago, then I landed one little part.

824
01:23:47.24 --> 01:23:49.24
I'm not landing.

825
01:23:49.24 --> 01:23:54.24
The, you know, people always hear what do they call it?

826
01:23:54.24 --> 01:23:55.24
What's the bias echo?

827
01:23:55.24 --> 01:23:57.24
I need your help on bias.

828
01:23:57.24 --> 01:23:58.24
Survival bias?

829
01:23:58.24 --> 01:23:59.24
Survival bias?

830
01:23:59.24 --> 01:24:01.24
I always hear about survival shit bias.

831
01:24:01.24 --> 01:24:06.24
You always hear about the person that went in stormed into the office and I need to audition for this role.

832
01:24:06.24 --> 01:24:08.24
And then they got it and then everything's cool.

833
01:24:08.24 --> 01:24:09.24
You don't hear this one.

834
01:24:09.24 --> 01:24:13.24
We're like, you storm in, you're committed until you're believing in yourself.

835
01:24:13.24 --> 01:24:16.24
And you stand there and say, no, I need to talk to Robert Redford.

836
01:24:16.24 --> 01:24:17.24
I'm here.

837
01:24:17.24 --> 01:24:20.24
Gary Sunnis is in the house.

838
01:24:20.24 --> 01:24:23.24
And he's like, cool.

839
01:24:23.24 --> 01:24:24.24
Get out.

840
01:24:24.24 --> 01:24:26.24
Call it security.

841
01:24:26.24 --> 01:24:35.24
You don't get to, that's why I like this story because because people think, hey, they think if they do that, whatever that thing is, that it's going to work.

842
01:24:35.24 --> 01:24:36.24
And it done, it's work.

843
01:24:36.24 --> 01:24:43.24
That's not always, I got, I remember times where I auditioned for something in Hollywood.

844
01:24:43.24 --> 01:24:48.24
And I remember, at the end of the audition, the casting director goes to me.

845
01:24:48.24 --> 01:24:51.24
Where did you study?

846
01:24:51.24 --> 01:24:53.24
And I said, well, I didn't study.

847
01:24:53.24 --> 01:24:56.24
My own theater company. I've been working with my own theater company.

848
01:24:56.24 --> 01:25:01.24
I did acting in high school and, well, don't you think you should study a little bit?

849
01:25:01.24 --> 01:25:04.24
And I said, well, I have my own theater company.

850
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:05.24
We've been doing really well.

851
01:25:05.24 --> 01:25:10.24
And I mean, I want to, I think you should come back here after you've studied.

852
01:25:10.24 --> 01:25:15.24
And she was telling me to go get acting lessons, you know, because I wasn't good enough.

853
01:25:15.24 --> 01:25:18.24
And I never forgot that.

854
01:25:18.24 --> 01:25:19.24
I never forgot that.

855
01:25:19.24 --> 01:25:22.24
So I went back to Chicago and did my theater company.

856
01:25:22.24 --> 01:25:24.24
And I came in the back door.

857
01:25:24.24 --> 01:25:30.24
I was going to say, don't you think if there's someone in Hollywood?

858
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:32.24
That had to pay their little dues.

859
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:34.24
They had to go to their acting.

860
01:25:34.24 --> 01:25:35.24
They had to do all these things.

861
01:25:35.24 --> 01:25:39.24
And then you show up trying to sneak in the back door that they kind of hold that against you?

862
01:25:39.24 --> 01:25:46.24
Well, you know, what, what I mean by sneak in the back door is,

863
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:51.24
I focused on the theater company and building the theater company in Chicago.

864
01:25:51.24 --> 01:25:57.24
And doing our work, we eventually moved some of that work to New York City,

865
01:25:57.24 --> 01:26:01.24
where it became very, very popular.

866
01:26:01.24 --> 01:26:08.24
So now we're doing shows in New York and all the casting directors and producers and people from Hollywood

867
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:11.24
are going to New York and they're seeing our shows.

868
01:26:11.24 --> 01:26:14.24
And next thing I know, people know who I am.

869
01:26:14.24 --> 01:26:16.24
I can get the audition if I want.

870
01:26:16.24 --> 01:26:20.24
And it's just because we were able to show our work, show what we do.

871
01:26:20.24 --> 01:26:25.24
And so what we do on stage, when you go in an audition, you're sitting in a room like this,

872
01:26:25.24 --> 01:26:30.24
and you got two guys like that, and they're looking at you and you're emoting,

873
01:26:30.24 --> 01:26:32.24
you know, or you're doing whatever you're doing.

874
01:26:32.24 --> 01:26:35.24
Somebody's reading, you know, reading the other part,

875
01:26:35.24 --> 01:26:39.24
and they're kind of flat, and you're supposed to act with them and all that stuff.

876
01:26:39.24 --> 01:26:43.24
It's really, you know, are you in a hotel room and you're doing that?

877
01:26:43.24 --> 01:26:46.24
It's really, it's not, it's no fun.

878
01:26:46.24 --> 01:26:52.24
I prefer to just go back to Chicago, do our work, and show what we do.

879
01:26:52.24 --> 01:26:54.24
And that ended up working.

880
01:26:54.24 --> 01:26:55.24
Yeah, that's the DIY.

881
01:26:55.24 --> 01:26:57.24
That's the punk rock mentality.

882
01:26:57.24 --> 01:27:03.24
I know that you are basically too old to be part of that scene,

883
01:27:03.24 --> 01:27:05.24
but that's pretty punk rock to say, oh, you know what?

884
01:27:05.24 --> 01:27:07.24
Okay, I'm not going to play your game.

885
01:27:07.24 --> 01:27:10.24
I'll be over here building an empire.

886
01:27:10.24 --> 01:27:11.24
What do you got?

887
01:27:11.24 --> 01:27:15.24
Yeah, you talk about that.

888
01:27:15.24 --> 01:27:18.24
But just before I left Hollywood, my agent landed me in audition for a bit.

889
01:27:18.24 --> 01:27:21.24
Part on prime time, evening soap opera, not landing.

890
01:27:21.24 --> 01:27:25.24
Playing a teenager, doing some underage drinking at a party on the beach.

891
01:27:25.24 --> 01:27:28.24
Well, at least you were kind of, you know, that wasn't really a stretch.

892
01:27:28.24 --> 01:27:29.24
My wheelhouse.

893
01:27:29.24 --> 01:27:31.24
I got the part.

894
01:27:31.24 --> 01:27:35.24
My character's name was Lee Maddix, and had a couple of lines,

895
01:27:35.24 --> 01:27:38.24
and a make-out scene with a girl while sitting beside a campfire.

896
01:27:38.24 --> 01:27:41.24
My very first time acting film.

897
01:27:41.24 --> 01:27:43.24
Let's just say it wasn't from here to eternity.

898
01:27:43.24 --> 01:27:46.24
Certainly, not enough to keep me in Los Angeles any longer.

899
01:27:46.24 --> 01:27:51.24
Step and we'll open the 1980 season in March.

900
01:27:51.24 --> 01:27:53.24
I moved back with no place to live.

901
01:27:53.24 --> 01:27:55.24
I just showed up with my bags and said hi, I'm back.

902
01:27:55.24 --> 01:27:58.24
Well, can I do stepping wolf folded me into the company immediately?

903
01:27:58.24 --> 01:28:00.24
Although our current season was already underway,

904
01:28:00.24 --> 01:28:02.24
so I had no former roles to play.

905
01:28:02.24 --> 01:28:06.24
Then you did some stand-ins when guys were sick or whatever.

906
01:28:06.24 --> 01:28:09.24
Step and wolf wasn't rolling in dough,

907
01:28:09.24 --> 01:28:12.24
but we could finally pay our actors a bit.

908
01:28:12.24 --> 01:28:14.24
That's a big step.

909
01:28:14.24 --> 01:28:20.24
You did a play called Getting Out.

910
01:28:20.24 --> 01:28:24.24
I received my first award nomination called The Joseph Jefferson Award.

911
01:28:24.24 --> 01:28:27.24
The nomination was for Best Supporting Actor and I won.

912
01:28:27.24 --> 01:28:31.24
I loved Chicago, and Hollywood, I was a dopey disco dancer in the background

913
01:28:31.24 --> 01:28:32.24
with Luke and Laura.

914
01:28:32.24 --> 01:28:35.24
I was a loser guy on the beach, and I'd been thrown out the lot

915
01:28:35.24 --> 01:28:36.24
in Warner Bros.

916
01:28:36.24 --> 01:28:40.24
and told by a casting director come back when I had some acting lessons.

917
01:28:40.24 --> 01:28:43.24
I couldn't get ahead no matter how hard I tried, but back in Chicago.

918
01:28:43.24 --> 01:28:45.24
I went to work as an actor almost right away.

919
01:28:45.24 --> 01:28:49.24
I got paid for it and won a recognized award all within six months.

920
01:28:49.24 --> 01:28:52.24
Meanwhile, this is going on.

921
01:28:52.24 --> 01:28:55.24
I'm more of a finished nursing schooling California.

922
01:28:55.24 --> 01:28:58.24
Yet she never worked as a nurse. She moved back in Chicago in 1981.

923
01:28:58.24 --> 01:29:01.24
I rejoined the company, and we formally rekindled our relationship.

924
01:29:01.24 --> 01:29:04.24
Somewhere in the middle of the revival production of

925
01:29:04.24 --> 01:29:10.24
BOM of, how do you say this, BOM in Gilliat, BOM in Gilliat, Moyra and I

926
01:29:10.24 --> 01:29:16.24
took a good look at each other shrugged and said to each other, hey, let's get married.

927
01:29:16.24 --> 01:29:19.24
So you're back in the game.

928
01:29:19.24 --> 01:29:22.24
H.E. Baccus.

929
01:29:22.24 --> 01:29:23.24
Baccus.

930
01:29:23.24 --> 01:29:24.24
Baccus.

931
01:29:24.24 --> 01:29:26.24
H.E. Baccus was the artistic director.

932
01:29:26.24 --> 01:29:28.24
He quits.

933
01:29:28.24 --> 01:29:33.24
And then it's between you and Malkovitch being suggested to be the AD artistic director.

934
01:29:33.24 --> 01:29:35.24
You like that echo, Charles?

935
01:29:35.24 --> 01:29:36.24
Yes.

936
01:29:36.24 --> 01:29:38.24
He's kind of a Hollywood guy.

937
01:29:38.24 --> 01:29:41.24
The ensemble voted.

938
01:29:41.24 --> 01:29:43.24
And you landed the position.

939
01:29:43.24 --> 01:29:46.24
You thought Malkovitch was relieved.

940
01:29:46.24 --> 01:29:50.24
And this is where I sense Mac Harris.

941
01:29:50.24 --> 01:29:52.24
I was convinced.

942
01:29:52.24 --> 01:29:54.24
So now you're taking over as the artistic director.

943
01:29:54.24 --> 01:29:56.24
Which, so what does that mean?

944
01:29:56.24 --> 01:29:57.24
You're picking the place?

945
01:29:57.24 --> 01:29:59.24
Yeah, run the company.

946
01:29:59.24 --> 01:29:59.24
Yeah.

947
01:29:59.24 --> 01:30:04.24
Basically, there's a managing director of deals with the business, the artistic director

948
01:30:04.24 --> 01:30:09.24
kind of deals with the season and how the players are going to work and the casting and all that kind of stuff.

949
01:30:09.24 --> 01:30:13.24
Are you allowed to veto some weird directing ideas?

950
01:30:13.24 --> 01:30:14.24
Yeah.

951
01:30:14.24 --> 01:30:15.24
Okay.

952
01:30:15.24 --> 01:30:16.24
So you're kind of the man.

953
01:30:16.24 --> 01:30:17.24
Decision maker.

954
01:30:17.24 --> 01:30:18.24
Check.

955
01:30:18.24 --> 01:30:20.24
So you take over as AD.

956
01:30:20.24 --> 01:30:22.24
Although, can I say one thing?

957
01:30:22.24 --> 01:30:23.24
Yeah.

958
01:30:23.24 --> 01:30:26.24
H.E. Baccus when he was the artistic director.

959
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:29.24
We appointed him in the first season.

960
01:30:29.24 --> 01:30:32.24
Nobody wanted to do it, so we made him do it.

961
01:30:32.24 --> 01:30:35.24
And H.E.E. was very diplomatic and easy-going.

962
01:30:35.24 --> 01:30:39.24
Very, you know, he listen to everybody and everything like that.

963
01:30:39.24 --> 01:30:44.24
So people were kind of used to a little bit more free flowing whatever.

964
01:30:44.24 --> 01:30:46.24
Let's do this and do that.

965
01:30:46.24 --> 01:30:49.24
I came in and I had a very different style.

966
01:30:49.24 --> 01:30:50.24
Yeah.

967
01:30:50.24 --> 01:30:57.24
It's interesting that even this group, so I'll work with companies where they,

968
01:30:57.24 --> 01:31:02.24
I've worked with companies where they, they have literally a flat organization, meaning no one's in charge.

969
01:31:02.24 --> 01:31:05.24
And they're very, they're always very proud of this.

970
01:31:05.24 --> 01:31:07.24
Doesn't usually work great.

971
01:31:07.24 --> 01:31:13.24
So I find it interesting that even you guys this group of, you know, crazy actors and actresses

972
01:31:13.24 --> 01:31:18.24
says, hey, you know what, we need, we need somebody to be in charge of this ship, right?

973
01:31:18.24 --> 01:31:21.24
It's, it's just very interesting from a leadership perspective.

974
01:31:21.24 --> 01:31:27.24
Even if the leader is a guy like H.E.E. who's laid back and not really, you know,

975
01:31:27.24 --> 01:31:33.24
a heavy leadership presence on every decision, but he's, he's at least got some oversight of the deal.

976
01:31:33.24 --> 01:31:36.24
Yeah, and he's smart and people respect him.

977
01:31:36.24 --> 01:31:38.24
Yeah, and he's, he's staring at, right?

978
01:31:38.24 --> 01:31:40.24
Somewhat, even if he's staring at suddenly.

979
01:31:40.24 --> 01:31:45.24
So in groups we need leaders, just kind of making that point.

980
01:31:45.24 --> 01:31:49.24
So you roll in, roll in in hot, as they say.

981
01:31:49.24 --> 01:31:52.24
I was convinced we needed to approach our work more like a business.

982
01:31:52.24 --> 01:31:55.24
The following Monday I came in with a new set of rules.

983
01:31:55.24 --> 01:31:59.24
High on the list was all staff members in my 9 a.m. every day.

984
01:31:59.24 --> 01:32:02.24
I made several other changes and even fired someone.

985
01:32:02.24 --> 01:32:08.24
Good Lord, the new rules and approach came as a shock to the ensemble, sort of like general patented just walked in.

986
01:32:08.24 --> 01:32:13.24
While we still maintain our collaborative approach to the direction we wanted to go as company

987
01:32:13.24 --> 01:32:21.24
as AD I felt it was time to approach things a bit differently to step up our game and allow the artistic director to lead in a new way.

988
01:32:21.24 --> 01:32:26.24
One rule I implemented was the now infamous at least among the company No Pot rule.

989
01:32:26.24 --> 01:32:33.24
No Pot could be smoked or eaten anywhere around the theater until after show time.

990
01:32:33.24 --> 01:32:38.24
No beer either. Everyone fought the No Pot rule as hilarious coming from a guy who openly part took from time to time,

991
01:32:38.24 --> 01:32:40.24
but for the most part everyone will along with it.

992
01:32:40.24 --> 01:32:46.24
So what I find interesting about this is I wrote another book here.

993
01:32:46.24 --> 01:32:49.24
The book is called Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual.

994
01:32:49.24 --> 01:32:57.24
And what I find interesting about this is I'm often explaining to companies that you as an individual human being.

995
01:32:57.24 --> 01:33:00.24
If you want to have freedom then you need to have discipline.

996
01:33:00.24 --> 01:33:04.24
And I explained to companies that as a company as a business.

997
01:33:04.24 --> 01:33:07.24
If you want to have freedom you have to have discipline.

998
01:33:07.24 --> 01:33:12.24
You have to become a public standard operating procedures. You have to do things like everyone get to work by night.

999
01:33:12.24 --> 01:33:18.24
So I find it interesting that you recognize these things.

1000
01:33:18.24 --> 01:33:23.24
You obviously saw that hey we're doing okay right now, but if we're going to really step up our game,

1001
01:33:23.24 --> 01:33:25.24
I'm going to need to impose some discipline here.

1002
01:33:25.24 --> 01:33:28.24
Well yeah, that's what it was.

1003
01:33:28.24 --> 01:33:33.24
At that time, it's people will just show up and we rehearsed our plays.

1004
01:33:33.24 --> 01:33:35.24
We are very serious on stage.

1005
01:33:35.24 --> 01:33:37.24
Yeah, everybody loved acting.

1006
01:33:37.24 --> 01:33:40.24
We loved doing the work on stage.

1007
01:33:40.24 --> 01:33:46.24
But it was a little undisciplined, you know, as a business.

1008
01:33:46.24 --> 01:33:49.24
And we were raising money.

1009
01:33:49.24 --> 01:33:51.24
We were, we had a board of directors.

1010
01:33:51.24 --> 01:33:54.24
We were trying to sell subscriptions now at this point.

1011
01:33:54.24 --> 01:33:56.24
What theater were you guys in at this point?

1012
01:33:56.24 --> 01:34:00.24
Now we had moved from Highland Park into the city of Chicago.

1013
01:34:00.24 --> 01:34:04.24
And so we're in about a hundred and thirty four seed theater that was already built.

1014
01:34:04.24 --> 01:34:06.24
We just rented it.

1015
01:34:06.24 --> 01:34:09.24
And we, you know, we were building our board all that.

1016
01:34:09.24 --> 01:34:12.24
So I wanted to improve all of those things.

1017
01:34:12.24 --> 01:34:19.24
And I really kind of saw us eventually taking one of our shows and moving it to New York to get international

1018
01:34:19.24 --> 01:34:22.24
and national recognition and exposure.

1019
01:34:22.24 --> 01:34:26.24
And I thought that would help us grow in the city of Chicago.

1020
01:34:26.24 --> 01:34:30.24
You know, I had ideas about how I wanted to lead the company.

1021
01:34:30.24 --> 01:34:32.24
And sometimes they worked with everybody.

1022
01:34:32.24 --> 01:34:34.24
Sometimes they didn't work with everybody.

1023
01:34:34.24 --> 01:34:37.24
And we'd have to have to do it out a little better,

1024
01:34:37.24 --> 01:34:39.24
vote on things, you know, and stuff.

1025
01:34:39.24 --> 01:34:46.24
But but eventually, you know, people got used to just the fact that now somebody was making real serious hard decisions

1026
01:34:46.24 --> 01:34:48.24
and change in the way we did.

1027
01:34:48.24 --> 01:34:52.24
Another thing that I talk about, it sounds like there's a little bit of this somewhere.

1028
01:34:52.24 --> 01:34:56.24
And it's actually a bunch of it in this new book I really should try to contact.

1029
01:34:56.24 --> 01:35:01.24
Is when there is a void of leadership, when there's a leadership vacuum.

1030
01:35:01.24 --> 01:35:04.24
People, people can sense it and they kind of know it.

1031
01:35:04.24 --> 01:35:09.24
And if someone steps into that vacuum and starts making decisions, everyone's kind of relieved that it finally happened.

1032
01:35:09.24 --> 01:35:10.24
People are like, okay, cool.

1033
01:35:10.24 --> 01:35:14.24
This guy's actually going to move us and look, it might not be the perfect direction,

1034
01:35:14.24 --> 01:35:16.24
but we're all going to move there together and that's good enough.

1035
01:35:16.24 --> 01:35:19.24
So it sounds like maybe there was some of that as well.

1036
01:35:19.24 --> 01:35:24.24
I bet if you had jumped in there a few years earlier with this, where there was a little bit more ego.

1037
01:35:24.24 --> 01:35:27.24
It might have been resisted more.

1038
01:35:27.24 --> 01:35:38.24
Yeah, you may be right, because we're again, I described in the book that we were all trying to find each other and find ourselves and find our working relationships and people were breaking up.

1039
01:35:38.24 --> 01:35:41.24
And, you know, there's a lot of personal stuff going on.

1040
01:35:41.24 --> 01:35:48.24
It was a little crazy, but once we moved into the Chicago, once that decision was made to move the company away from the suburb.

1041
01:35:48.24 --> 01:35:56.24
Of Highland Park into the city, where there were other theaters and theater community going on and to become a part of that.

1042
01:35:56.24 --> 01:36:01.24
We, you know, we found ourselves needing some a little more discipline and whatnot.

1043
01:36:01.24 --> 01:36:05.24
So I just came in and did it the way and believe me.

1044
01:36:05.24 --> 01:36:08.24
I don't know where that all came from.

1045
01:36:08.24 --> 01:36:16.24
You know, I just, as a kid, I think I was the guy to organize the baseball game in the neighborhood or, you know,

1046
01:36:16.24 --> 01:36:20.24
who guy who come up with a set list for the band or whatever.

1047
01:36:20.24 --> 01:36:23.24
I always sort of led a little bit like that.

1048
01:36:23.24 --> 01:36:27.24
So, but I never led a theater company before.

1049
01:36:27.24 --> 01:36:28.24
I, this was all new.

1050
01:36:28.24 --> 01:36:35.24
I hate to jump into like trying to figure some of this out, but you got 134 seat theater in Chicago.

1051
01:36:35.24 --> 01:36:38.24
How many shows do you do a week?

1052
01:36:38.24 --> 01:36:40.24
We were doing about eight shows a week.

1053
01:36:40.24 --> 01:36:44.24
Oh, so you're doing like a show every night and two on Sunday or something like that or two on Saturday?

1054
01:36:44.24 --> 01:36:47.24
Yeah, Monday was the day off.

1055
01:36:47.24 --> 01:36:51.24
And then, oh, sort of like two on Friday or two on Saturday, two on Sunday, something like that?

1056
01:36:51.24 --> 01:36:52.24
Yeah, stuff like that.

1057
01:36:52.24 --> 01:36:54.24
And are you feeling that thing up?

1058
01:36:54.24 --> 01:36:55.24
No.

1059
01:36:55.24 --> 01:36:56.24
No.

1060
01:36:56.24 --> 01:36:58.24
You know, from time to time.

1061
01:36:58.24 --> 01:36:59.24
Okay.

1062
01:36:59.24 --> 01:37:05.24
I mean, that the play, for example, that you mentioned Balmond Gillia, that ended up being one of our massive hits.

1063
01:37:05.24 --> 01:37:10.24
And it sold out every night.

1064
01:37:10.24 --> 01:37:16.24
So, it all depended on word of mouth and the reviews and all that kind of thing.

1065
01:37:16.24 --> 01:37:23.24
The play that I talked about, uh, sab, the called savages with a naked people and everything that we, we barely had.

1066
01:37:23.24 --> 01:37:27.24
We had more people on stage than we're in the audience for that one.

1067
01:37:27.24 --> 01:37:33.24
So, you are, is, is 125 people, do you need microphones in that size?

1068
01:37:33.24 --> 01:37:35.24
Like on the, on the, on the 134 seats?

1069
01:37:35.24 --> 01:37:36.24
Yeah.

1070
01:37:36.24 --> 01:37:37.24
Sorry.

1071
01:37:37.24 --> 01:37:38.24
134 seats.

1072
01:37:38.24 --> 01:37:42.24
We had like three rows on the floor.

1073
01:37:42.24 --> 01:37:45.24
And then there was a little balcony that had two rows that went around.

1074
01:37:45.24 --> 01:37:49.24
It was, it was like a three quarter theater.

1075
01:37:49.24 --> 01:37:50.24
Okay.

1076
01:37:50.24 --> 01:37:55.24
So, so you had audience here, audience here and audience here on three sides.

1077
01:37:55.24 --> 01:37:57.24
And then the play was right here in the middle.

1078
01:37:57.24 --> 01:38:01.24
So, no microphones ever could just hear you and it's super raw.

1079
01:38:01.24 --> 01:38:02.24
Yeah.

1080
01:38:02.24 --> 01:38:05.24
And if there's 25 naked people at stage, it's super uncomfortable.

1081
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:06.24
Yeah.

1082
01:38:06.24 --> 01:38:07.24
It was, it was really raw.

1083
01:38:07.24 --> 01:38:08.24
Yeah.

1084
01:38:08.24 --> 01:38:17.24
And these were all, they were playing Brazilian, you know,

1085
01:38:17.24 --> 01:38:22.24
uh, proving, uh, a tribe.

1086
01:38:22.24 --> 01:38:27.24
And so these were all like most of the people that were in that,

1087
01:38:27.24 --> 01:38:32.24
and playing this, this tribe, like from Northwestern students.

1088
01:38:32.24 --> 01:38:36.24
So, you know, as white as you can be, right?

1089
01:38:36.24 --> 01:38:41.24
So, they used a very tan makeup on their bodies and everything.

1090
01:38:41.24 --> 01:38:44.24
And then after the show, they'd have to go to the showers.

1091
01:38:44.24 --> 01:38:50.24
And there was, there was also a gym with a locker room in this place that we had this theater.

1092
01:38:50.24 --> 01:38:57.24
And so, the entire cast, 25 people going to the showers and hit the showers after the show.

1093
01:38:57.24 --> 01:38:59.24
Luckily, I wasn't in this show.

1094
01:38:59.24 --> 01:39:02.24
I was just the artistic director who made the decision to do it.

1095
01:39:02.24 --> 01:39:05.24
Well, I hate to say this, but you got to take ownership of that.

1096
01:39:05.24 --> 01:39:10.24
And you know, at the guy in charge, you have to own those 25 naked sweaty people on stage.

1097
01:39:10.24 --> 01:39:12.24
I do, but I blame John Malkovich, so.

1098
01:39:12.24 --> 01:39:13.24
All right.

1099
01:39:13.24 --> 01:39:16.24
Well, you all let you have to go to the Goods for a minute.

1100
01:39:16.24 --> 01:39:21.24
It's a fun memory for everybody, you know, a misguided show, but we all get a kick out.

1101
01:39:21.24 --> 01:39:26.24
So, even though you're paying your actors, everyone still have the day jobs at this point.

1102
01:39:26.24 --> 01:39:28.24
Some people did.

1103
01:39:28.24 --> 01:39:29.24
Yeah.

1104
01:39:29.24 --> 01:39:32.24
As artistic director, now I was drawing a little bit of a salary.

1105
01:39:32.24 --> 01:39:33.24
So, so I...

1106
01:39:33.24 --> 01:39:35.24
And that didn't create any hostilities?

1107
01:39:35.24 --> 01:39:36.24
No, no, no.

1108
01:39:36.24 --> 01:39:41.24
Because we were able to pay certain key people that needed to be there all the time.

1109
01:39:41.24 --> 01:39:46.24
The artistic director, the managing director, stage manager, people like that.

1110
01:39:46.24 --> 01:39:49.24
You know, we were able to, you know, our construction folks.

1111
01:39:49.24 --> 01:39:52.24
We were able to, you know, we were building our board.

1112
01:39:52.24 --> 01:39:54.24
We were selling more tickets.

1113
01:39:54.24 --> 01:39:57.24
We were selling subscriptions now.

1114
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:00.24
Subscription means you can come any night of the week.

1115
01:40:00.24 --> 01:40:04.24
No, a subscription will mean you pay a certain price.

1116
01:40:04.24 --> 01:40:08.24
And you're buying all, let's say we have five plays in a season.

1117
01:40:08.24 --> 01:40:12.24
You're buying all five plays and you get a discount because you're buying all five.

1118
01:40:12.24 --> 01:40:15.24
And it's a subscription to this season.

1119
01:40:15.24 --> 01:40:16.24
Okay.

1120
01:40:16.24 --> 01:40:19.24
And we're making enough money with paying people.

1121
01:40:19.24 --> 01:40:22.24
All right.

1122
01:40:22.24 --> 01:40:27.24
At this point, you know, you delve into a little bit about your talking about Mac.

1123
01:40:27.24 --> 01:40:31.24
And you're talking about the impression that they made on you and we kind of already talked about that now.

1124
01:40:31.24 --> 01:40:35.24
But there's a play that you hear about.

1125
01:40:35.24 --> 01:40:43.24
And it's, it's a play called Tracers, which is written and performed by Vietnam veterans about their experiences before during and after the war.

1126
01:40:43.24 --> 01:40:44.24
A light bulb clicked on.

1127
01:40:44.24 --> 01:40:48.24
This is exactly what I was looking for on February 20, 1981.

1128
01:40:48.24 --> 01:40:51.24
I typed a two page letter to address.

1129
01:40:51.24 --> 01:40:58.24
To the entire Tracers ensemble in care of director John DeFusco.

1130
01:40:58.24 --> 01:41:02.24
The Vietnam vet who conceived the play, co-wrote it and owned the rights to it.

1131
01:41:02.24 --> 01:41:06.24
John DeFusco had never heard of Stepan Wolf, wrote back and said, no, sorry.

1132
01:41:06.24 --> 01:41:09.24
It's a play written in both written and performed by veterans.

1133
01:41:09.24 --> 01:41:10.24
And we fail.

1134
01:41:10.24 --> 01:41:13.24
It should be done always that way.

1135
01:41:13.24 --> 01:41:15.24
So we're not letting anybody out anybody else do it.

1136
01:41:15.24 --> 01:41:17.24
So you waited.

1137
01:41:17.24 --> 01:41:22.24
Time pass. Eventually you invite him to Chicago to see one of your shows.

1138
01:41:22.24 --> 01:41:23.24
Ballman Gillian.

1139
01:41:23.24 --> 01:41:26.24
Okay. So he sees that place is crowded.

1140
01:41:26.24 --> 01:41:29.24
And he sees that there's, what does he say?

1141
01:41:29.24 --> 01:41:31.24
You say gives it guest credibility.

1142
01:41:31.24 --> 01:41:34.24
Yeah. The play was very, very, very powerful.

1143
01:41:34.24 --> 01:41:38.24
So he could see that we were a real thing in a company at that point.

1144
01:41:38.24 --> 01:41:40.24
And he didn't know anything about us at that point.

1145
01:41:40.24 --> 01:41:45.24
And then you guys, you finally, he says you can do it.

1146
01:41:45.24 --> 01:41:50.24
And I'll go to the book here. I talked to my brother Mac about my brother and

1147
01:41:50.24 --> 01:41:52.24
Mom Mac about what he thought about putting on the play.

1148
01:41:52.24 --> 01:41:54.24
He liked the idea and informed me about certain details.

1149
01:41:54.24 --> 01:41:55.24
I need to make sure I got right.

1150
01:41:55.24 --> 01:41:59.24
More than anything, I wanted him to come see the play.

1151
01:41:59.24 --> 01:42:02.24
But in August 1983, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

1152
01:42:02.24 --> 01:42:07.24
Max, manual for the Army was published in October 1983.

1153
01:42:07.24 --> 01:42:12.24
And that same month, his promise and career in life were cut short.

1154
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:20.24
He passed away at age 39, leaving behind his wife and three year old daughter Katie.

1155
01:42:20.24 --> 01:42:27.24
You talk about going to the funeral, the honor guard, the flag draped coffin, the 21 gun salute.

1156
01:42:27.24 --> 01:42:28.24
I've never forgotten it.

1157
01:42:28.24 --> 01:42:33.24
Mac was laid to rest beside his father in the cemetery across the street from where he grew up.

1158
01:42:33.24 --> 01:42:38.24
We took a Colonel, boy, Makana, Mac Harris, truly lived a life of service to others.

1159
01:42:38.24 --> 01:42:43.24
And his passing only put the cap in my commitment to do the play right.

1160
01:42:43.24 --> 01:42:48.24
I want to trace her, trace her as to honor the Vietnam veterans, such as Mac Harris,

1161
01:42:48.24 --> 01:42:53.24
and help them tell their stories.

1162
01:42:53.24 --> 01:43:03.24
And then as that's happening, October 23, 1983 suicide bomber drives a truck in the building in Bay Route.

1163
01:43:03.24 --> 01:43:12.24
So you've got that happening and you're your desire to really do a great production.

1164
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:21.24
Gross even stronger.

1165
01:43:21.24 --> 01:43:27.24
You guys, you guys, you guys, you're riding like a boot camp.

1166
01:43:27.24 --> 01:43:29.24
Sort of to get ready for it.

1167
01:43:29.24 --> 01:43:38.24
You guys go out in the field and play little war games to try and get in the minds of the soldiers,

1168
01:43:38.24 --> 01:43:40.24
which I know they do that all the time now.

1169
01:43:40.24 --> 01:43:45.24
It seems when people are doing movies, they always put some kind of a military boot camp thing together for it.

1170
01:43:45.24 --> 01:43:47.24
Have you ever heard of that before?

1171
01:43:47.24 --> 01:43:49.24
Did you just kind of think we need to do it?

1172
01:43:49.24 --> 01:43:58.24
I don't know why because I remember a couple years later, this is 1983 that we're starting to work on this play.

1173
01:43:58.24 --> 01:44:06.24
And remember the movie Platoon, Charlie Sheen, and Affirmative?

1174
01:44:06.24 --> 01:44:08.24
Oliver Stone directed it.

1175
01:44:08.24 --> 01:44:16.24
So that came out about three years later and they did a whole boot camp thing and they lived in the jungle for two weeks and trained these guys and everything like that.

1176
01:44:16.24 --> 01:44:23.24
But three years early, I took this cast out and we did something similar in a way,

1177
01:44:23.24 --> 01:44:29.24
kind of our own little mini version of boot camp and I'm not sure where that idea came from.

1178
01:44:29.24 --> 01:44:35.24
I think it was just the desire to isolate my cast away from everything.

1179
01:44:35.24 --> 01:44:44.24
And somebody I knew was involved with a summer camp in Michigan that was closed down.

1180
01:44:44.24 --> 01:44:48.24
And so this is winter time now that we're rehearsing this play.

1181
01:44:48.24 --> 01:44:55.24
And they said they could arrange for me to go to the closed down summer camp.

1182
01:44:55.24 --> 01:45:04.24
And you know, stay in the in the cabins and I would just have it all of myself and they arranged that.

1183
01:45:04.24 --> 01:45:11.24
So I took my cast to this closed down summer camp in the winter and the snow is like this.

1184
01:45:11.24 --> 01:45:14.24
And we're playing Vietnam guys out in the snow.

1185
01:45:14.24 --> 01:45:18.24
And we had remember Dennis Farina the actor.

1186
01:45:18.24 --> 01:45:22.24
What was he? What would he be? He was in get shorty and he was in the.

1187
01:45:22.24 --> 01:45:24.24
Tell which echo.

1188
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:26.24
Okay. Yeah. If I remember him.

1189
01:45:26.24 --> 01:45:30.24
Yeah, he was in a lot of stuff. You recognize him.

1190
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:36.24
He's a Vietnam veteran himself and he was just getting into acting and I cast him as the drill instructor.

1191
01:45:36.24 --> 01:45:41.24
And so I told Dennis, you're going to be the drill instructor up at the summer camp with us.

1192
01:45:41.24 --> 01:45:48.24
And so I want you to wake us up in three in the morning banging on things and make everybody go out and the snow and do push ups.

1193
01:45:48.24 --> 01:45:52.24
So we did we did a whole thing up there for four or five days.

1194
01:45:52.24 --> 01:45:56.24
And just and it was it was.

1195
01:45:56.24 --> 01:46:01.24
It was just so galvanizing for the cast to come together in this isolated play.

1196
01:46:01.24 --> 01:46:04.24
Nobody was around is we're out in the middle of the woods.

1197
01:46:04.24 --> 01:46:13.24
And nobody's around and we were just there doing our sort of military thing together and bonding as a cast.

1198
01:46:13.24 --> 01:46:17.24
I directed the play. I wasn't in it, but I did everything that they were doing.

1199
01:46:17.24 --> 01:46:20.24
And you know, when I was snow and did the whole thing.

1200
01:46:20.24 --> 01:46:29.24
And it was it was an ingredient in the preparation of the play that was really I think just super debondless cast together.

1201
01:46:29.24 --> 01:46:45.24
I was very very committed because of the Vietnam veterans and my own family to telling these stories properly and having seen the original production twice and watching all these Vietnam veterans.

1202
01:46:45.24 --> 01:46:55.24
They were only two of them in that original cast that wrote this play that had done any acting before all the rest of them were veterans.

1203
01:46:55.24 --> 01:47:07.24
And they just came together and over a six month period they exercised their demons into a script and wrote a play based on their experiences in Vietnam.

1204
01:47:07.24 --> 01:47:15.24
What it was like to be there, serve their, come home from there, all that stuff and they put it into this play.

1205
01:47:15.24 --> 01:47:21.24
And I saw it. It was very powerful and they were all veterans performing their own stories.

1206
01:47:21.24 --> 01:47:27.24
And I thought, I got out. I'm going to do my best to live up to that.

1207
01:47:27.24 --> 01:47:36.24
They are entrusting me with their script, you know, and they're not given it to anybody else and they're entrusting me with the script.

1208
01:47:36.24 --> 01:47:45.24
And for them and the Vietnam veterans and my own family, I want to make sure that my cast really gets this thing. Why we're doing it, the importance of it.

1209
01:47:45.24 --> 01:47:53.24
And this is 1983. So the wall was opened, you know, just prior to that, right?

1210
01:47:53.24 --> 01:48:07.24
The Vietnam veteran really hadn't been welcome home. You know, if you, I don't know if you're younger than I am, but in 8485 all of a sudden there were some welcome home parades for the Vietnam veteran.

1211
01:48:07.24 --> 01:48:17.24
The, the parades that they never got when they came home, the welcome home experience that they were denied. And this play,

1212
01:48:17.24 --> 01:48:30.24
Tracers was happening right around the same time. So something was changing. And I remember the cast was so powerful. They really got what I was trying to do.

1213
01:48:30.24 --> 01:48:43.24
We rehearsed the play. We put it on its feet. And I want veterans to come see it. It was very important to me that veterans would come see this show.

1214
01:48:43.24 --> 01:48:58.24
So we made Tuesday night free for veterans. And the word spread throughout the community in Chicago and veterans, especially Vietnam veterans were coming in droves.

1215
01:48:58.24 --> 01:49:05.24
And some nights, some of those Tuesday nights, we would have nothing but veterans almost in the audience.

1216
01:49:05.24 --> 01:49:14.24
At this point, we were in a new theater, another new theater that had 220 seats. And can you imagine that?

1217
01:49:14.24 --> 01:49:20.24
You know, veterans coming with their own family members, and they've never talked about their own experiences.

1218
01:49:20.24 --> 01:49:29.24
And now their family members are watching these actors on stage kind of relive some of the things that they'd gone through. And we would have discussions after the show.

1219
01:49:29.24 --> 01:49:36.24
And people would ask questions and the veterans would talk and they would talk about their experience and their wife is sitting right next to him.

1220
01:49:36.24 --> 01:49:48.24
And she's going, he never said any of this to me before. It was a real cathartic healing thing that happened with Tracers and it changed my life.

1221
01:49:48.24 --> 01:49:55.24
And Galvanized something in me that would take root very deeply in the coming years.

1222
01:49:55.24 --> 01:50:07.24
You say in here about it, after each performance we received a standing ovation, the crowd cheered wildly.

1223
01:50:07.24 --> 01:50:15.24
The reviews came back positive. We decided to provide a free performance which you go into.

1224
01:50:15.24 --> 01:50:25.24
And then you say this today, people often ask me about the highlights of my career. Tracers is one an incredibly meaningful, absolutely extraordinary experience.

1225
01:50:25.24 --> 01:50:31.24
As we did this play, I could see that the veterans felt like something was happening for them.

1226
01:50:31.24 --> 01:50:40.24
They've been stuck in the shadows, discredited and abused or simply ignored. And now they were watching these actors honor them and bring their stories out of the shadows.

1227
01:50:40.24 --> 01:50:47.24
I will always be grateful to John DeFusco and the cast of Tracers for the opportunity to work on this life changing play.

1228
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:56.24
For the first time I felt like I was giving back by honoring our veterans, by not letting them fall through the cracks, by not letting them feel unappreciated or forgotten.

1229
01:50:56.24 --> 01:51:00.24
I met many Vietnam veterans who attended our free performances.

1230
01:51:00.24 --> 01:51:09.24
And in the early 1990s, I was asked to help raise funds to build the Lansing Lansing Veterans Memorial in Lansing, Illinois.

1231
01:51:09.24 --> 01:51:23.24
Vietnam veteran who had seen Tracers, Tom Lubaerta, Lubaerta, organized the creation of the memorial. It features the names of our fallen heroes on a black granite wall with a giant UH1 Huehe helicopter mounted overhead,

1232
01:51:23.24 --> 01:51:30.24
while a statue of a soldier carrying a wounded comrade to the waiting chopper stands as a reminder to never leave anyone behind.

1233
01:51:30.24 --> 01:51:37.24
I was honored to play some small part in helping Tom and the veterans realize their dream.

1234
01:51:37.24 --> 01:51:44.24
And to say thanks for my involvement, they put my brother-in-law's name on the wall.

1235
01:51:44.24 --> 01:52:09.24
Lieutenant Colonel Boyd Makana Harris, US Army, 19th Infantry Division, a Marical Division, Vietnam.

1236
01:52:09.24 --> 01:52:20.24
When here I'm going to perhaps reveal my own personal lack of culture, which is not very hard to uncover.

1237
01:52:20.24 --> 01:52:23.24
I'm not a very cultured person, right?

1238
01:52:23.24 --> 01:52:32.24
I grew up in the military, I didn't go to museums or go to see plays or whatever.

1239
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:40.24
When you do this, when you do plays, who? Theatre, right?

1240
01:52:40.24 --> 01:52:47.24
Do you ever feel like, hey, it's gone? Like, you know, we're sitting here talking about Tracers, I want to watch it.

1241
01:52:47.24 --> 01:52:52.24
You know, I want to go watch it. And you know, you can't. Do you feel like that?

1242
01:52:52.24 --> 01:52:59.24
Or is that something that kind of provides some of the magic to it? Because it's something that's fleeting?

1243
01:52:59.24 --> 01:53:04.24
Yeah, it's a living kind of thing that when it's over, it's over.

1244
01:53:04.24 --> 01:53:10.24
Unless you've got something like, you know, cats or something.

1245
01:53:10.24 --> 01:53:14.24
Which is, you know, a fan of the opera that never over.

1246
01:53:14.24 --> 01:53:18.24
And it's fourth decade, and it's continuing on.

1247
01:53:18.24 --> 01:53:22.24
You know, that's the thing about theater.

1248
01:53:22.24 --> 01:53:29.24
You know, sometimes I've been in things that were over and then restarted again, and then we did it again, and then we did it again.

1249
01:53:29.24 --> 01:53:35.24
And, you know, because there was more blood to suck out of it.

1250
01:53:35.24 --> 01:53:45.24
But it usually was because it was something really positive, something really good, something creative, and something that we wanted to keep alive a little bit more.

1251
01:53:45.24 --> 01:53:58.24
The grapes of wrath was kind of like that. When we put the grapes of wrath on stage, we had 650 page book, and we adapted it for the stage, and we put it on stage in Chicago and 88, then we put it back up again.

1252
01:53:58.24 --> 01:54:07.24
We took it to La Jolla, California, and London in 89, and then we moved it to Broadway in 1990, and at one, one, the Tony Award.

1253
01:54:07.24 --> 01:54:14.24
That was an ongoing sort of, we kept working on it and kept refining it, kept making it better and everything.

1254
01:54:14.24 --> 01:54:20.24
Sometimes you get those kind of projects that have a big life.

1255
01:54:20.24 --> 01:54:30.24
But generally, when you're doing a season of plays, you're doing five plays, you know, you wrap it up after five weeks, and it's done. You go on to the next play.

1256
01:54:30.24 --> 01:54:35.24
I just did these live gigs. I did six of them.

1257
01:54:35.24 --> 01:54:47.24
And each one of them was different. So, yeah, each one of them was different. Like I would, as a matter of fact, the one I did, and I was writing them right before I'd do them.

1258
01:54:47.24 --> 01:54:56.24
And it was interesting because like when we do the podcast, right, it's recorded. It's there for, for all practical purposes.

1259
01:54:56.24 --> 01:55:15.24
It's going to be there for a long time, right? It's on the interwebs. Those, those live gigs were one shot, and that made it very interesting for me, because I knew that I was just going to do this one time.

1260
01:55:15.24 --> 01:55:23.24
The other thing is I got the feeling of what it was like to have a bunch of people sitting right there, because in the podcast, right?

1261
01:55:23.24 --> 01:55:30.24
It's just echo sitting there or whoever the guest is sitting there and we're talking about something, but you forget that there's a million people out there, right?

1262
01:55:30.24 --> 01:55:33.24
Where you don't forget it, but it's not, it's different.

1263
01:55:33.24 --> 01:55:44.24
Right. The impact of having these people, you know, having people sitting there with you in the room is there's a little, I started thinking about it.

1264
01:55:44.24 --> 01:55:56.24
But as you were describing this, I'm like, oh, that's, that's that thing. That's why, because let's face it. If you look at it from a pragmatic perspective, go to a movie, right?

1265
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:05.24
From a pragmatic perspective, hey, you don't need to get a bunch of human beings on a weird stage somewhere and do all these lights and have them try and remember there are little lines.

1266
01:56:05.24 --> 01:56:14.24
No, you go and see a movie, but there's a reason why the theater still exists, and that's because there's this, there's this thing of going live.

1267
01:56:14.24 --> 01:56:24.24
It's same thing with seeing a live rock concert, right? Hey, why not just watch a DVD of the band playing their hits, right?

1268
01:56:24.24 --> 01:56:33.24
You could say that that's a pragmatic solution, right? From, you know, from just a practical sense, oh, I'll just put on the DVD.

1269
01:56:33.24 --> 01:56:44.24
Go into see a fight. Hey, go into a see a fight. You see, you get a much better view when you're sitting at home on your 87 inch flat screen television.

1270
01:56:44.24 --> 01:56:55.24
And you can record it. And you can, you can rewind it, right? You can replay it, but when you're there in the Coliseum, there's something going on.

1271
01:56:55.24 --> 01:57:11.24
So I guess that's what I was trying to figure out if you ever felt like, oh, hold on a second, how do we capture this? And I guess part of the magic is that you can't fully capture it. You have to do it live from night tonight.

1272
01:57:11.24 --> 01:57:22.24
It's going to change too. I mean, the blueprint is the same, but because the audience is reacting differently from night to night, the actors are just too.

1273
01:57:22.24 --> 01:57:31.24
And you discover things along the way. The play is never the same at the end of the run as it is at the beginning of the run, because it evolves.

1274
01:57:31.24 --> 01:57:43.24
Once you factor in the audience and their participation with you and the interaction that they have with you, while they're watching the play, things evolve. You learn things along the way, things change.

1275
01:57:43.24 --> 01:57:51.24
I remember we recorded, we did a play, me and Malkovitch called True West.

1276
01:57:51.24 --> 01:58:04.24
And the two of us played brothers and it was a long run. And we were off Broadway. It was the first thing we did in New York and the thing that kind of put us sort of on a national map.

1277
01:58:04.24 --> 01:58:13.24
And that play evolved quite a bit. We were improvising, we were changing things. This was written by Sam Shepherd.

1278
01:58:13.24 --> 01:58:24.24
And it very, very well written play. A lot of people have done it. But by the end of the run for us, you know, it had gone into a whole other thing.

1279
01:58:24.24 --> 01:58:32.24
And it was simply because John and I are the kinds of actors that are going to give and take and bounce around. He's going to do something different from night to night.

1280
01:58:32.24 --> 01:58:43.24
So I'll react differently or vice versa or whatever. And therefore, you know, if it works, you keep it. And so that the play evolves as time goes on.

1281
01:58:43.24 --> 01:59:01.24
It's really a neat experience live life theater performed. But it's also endurance. You know, it's, you know, eight shows a week. If you're doing a play like True West, which is two brothers fighting on stage, beating each other up, you know, going crazy, screaming and yelling blah, blah, blah, blah.

1282
01:59:01.24 --> 01:59:15.24
Night after night after night, you know, it's an endurance test. I couldn't do that particular thing as I'm 64 now. You know, I'd like the, I'd play the psychiatrist.

1283
01:59:15.24 --> 01:59:19.24
I said, sit and ask questions in the chair, you know.

1284
01:59:19.24 --> 01:59:28.24
I had this weird. So again, I'm only just diving into this a little bit because I have an actual professional here.

1285
01:59:28.24 --> 01:59:38.24
I was doing these live gigs. And as I was going to do them. So I know a bunch of comedians and not a bunch, but I know a few comedians.

1286
01:59:38.24 --> 01:59:43.24
And some of them are really good like Joe Rogan and Theo Vaughn.

1287
01:59:43.24 --> 01:59:54.24
And I saw I've, I have some relationships with some of these guys. And I kind of listened to them talk about being a comedian and one of the things that they talk about is when you're making a show.

1288
01:59:54.24 --> 02:00:02.24
They go out to like a small club and they do like their routine. And then they, they do it a little bit better and they change something. They add something.

1289
02:00:02.24 --> 02:00:09.24
They take something away. They add something else. And until they get it and this is what made me think of this. You're talking about how you hear the audience react and you go, okay, that's good. I'll add to that.

1290
02:00:09.24 --> 02:00:13.24
And you hear the audience react differently. I'll remove that.

1291
02:00:13.24 --> 02:00:22.24
And eventually they get to a point where they go, okay, now I can take this thing out on the road and they do, they do. They go on tour with it.

1292
02:00:22.24 --> 02:00:33.24
And I like on my second show because now I'm changed. I was doing something different. And I was like, hey, I don't take any lessons learned from the last one.

1293
02:00:33.24 --> 02:00:42.24
And I have no idea what everyone's going to think of this one I'm doing tonight, which was kind of not it might not be smart, but that's what I did.

1294
02:00:42.24 --> 02:00:45.24
Doesn't seem like a smart thing to do.

1295
02:00:45.24 --> 02:00:54.24
When you took that show to New York, not everyone was on board. When you took true West to New York. So there's a little leadership challenge that you faced.

1296
02:00:54.24 --> 02:01:03.24
And in fact, when you took that show to New York, when you took true, true West to New York, they told you guys, you, this isn't step and wolf, right?

1297
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:05.24
That's, that's how it went down.

1298
02:01:05.24 --> 02:01:10.24
Well, what happened was I wanted to, to move the, the show.

1299
02:01:10.24 --> 02:01:23.24
And we're in this 134th seat theater where we did true West originally. And we had the opportunity to take over another theater that had more seats that had been kind of closed down for a while.

1300
02:01:23.24 --> 02:01:25.24
And it was sitting there waiting to be rented.

1301
02:01:25.24 --> 02:01:27.24
And we needed to add more seats.

1302
02:01:27.24 --> 02:01:30.24
We were building our subscribers, our audience is getting stronger.

1303
02:01:30.24 --> 02:01:36.24
We wanted more seats. So we wanted to go from 134 to the 220 in this building.

1304
02:01:36.24 --> 02:01:43.24
And this, this, you know, David Mammot. So, will you make to may see actors like that?

1305
02:01:43.24 --> 02:01:49.24
They started this theater company called St. Nicholas. They went bankrupt and this building was just sitting there.

1306
02:01:49.24 --> 02:01:56.24
And so we wanted to take it over. We had the, at the same time, we had the opportunity to open that new theater.

1307
02:01:56.24 --> 02:02:01.24
We had the opportunity to move true West to New York.

1308
02:02:01.24 --> 02:02:06.24
Most of the company said they didn't want to go to New York and do that.

1309
02:02:06.24 --> 02:02:13.24
And we had a focus on opening this new theater. I said as our district director, I think we have to do both.

1310
02:02:13.24 --> 02:02:19.24
And it was my show. I wanted to move it. I brought the producers in. I wanted John was in it.

1311
02:02:19.24 --> 02:02:25.24
You know, I want, and they said, and two of the actors that were in it. There's four actors total.

1312
02:02:25.24 --> 02:02:29.24
John and I were the only ones who wanted to do it.

1313
02:02:29.24 --> 02:02:35.24
The other actors didn't want to do it and go. So I said, well, okay, we'll recast those parts in New York.

1314
02:02:35.24 --> 02:02:44.24
Well, that didn't go over well with the theater company at all. So they said, well, if you're going to do that, then you can't call it a step-in-law show.

1315
02:02:44.24 --> 02:02:49.24
And so we moved it to New York, John and I, I recast the other parts.

1316
02:02:49.24 --> 02:02:58.24
And we opened the show without calling it step-in-law. But, and there was a lot of tension between John and me and the other,

1317
02:02:58.24 --> 02:03:04.24
and the other people in the company. And they just didn't agree with it. And we went and made the decision to do it.

1318
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:11.24
But in our bios in the program, all the credits we had were step-in-law.

1319
02:03:11.24 --> 02:03:17.24
It's a Gary Sunise's the artistic director of a step-in-multi-in-or-John Malk, which has done all these plays.

1320
02:03:17.24 --> 02:03:23.24
It's step-in-multi and Chicago. So all the critics were reading those bios.

1321
02:03:23.24 --> 02:03:30.24
Who are these guys from Chicago and they read about step-in-multi? So step-in-multi is now getting all kinds of attention.

1322
02:03:30.24 --> 02:03:40.24
Because true West ended up being a big hit. And it was a giant hit. And people were coming from all over all over the country really to see it.

1323
02:03:40.24 --> 02:03:49.24
Because it was so popular. And it put step-in-multi into a more nationally recognized position.

1324
02:03:49.24 --> 02:03:56.24
And we were getting a lot of attention from the New York media. Great reviews. Lots of people were coming to see it.

1325
02:03:56.24 --> 02:04:01.24
And it really turned everything around. After that, the company said,

1326
02:04:01.24 --> 02:04:06.24
Oh, that's great. Let's do more in New York. And we started bringing a lot of plays to New York after that.

1327
02:04:06.24 --> 02:04:10.24
But somebody has to be the first one to go over the hill.

1328
02:04:10.24 --> 02:04:18.24
And we did. John and I took it and we were successful. We did okay. And we moved forward from there.

1329
02:04:18.24 --> 02:04:26.24
You talk about kind of how you give the reviews. You guys get these great reviews. Everyone's fired up.

1330
02:04:26.24 --> 02:04:32.24
You say this. John's performances especially getting a lot of attention. And his star began to rise during the run.

1331
02:04:32.24 --> 02:04:36.24
He was doing media interviews and photo sessions for magazine covers.

1332
02:04:36.24 --> 02:04:42.24
And you say John was so powerful in the show and getting press, comparing him to Marlon Brando.

1333
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:49.24
The week after we opened, John told me he'd been approached by William Morris Town on Agent Johnny Planco.

1334
02:04:49.24 --> 02:04:57.24
Planko. And it's signed with him. But after two or three months of running the show, no agents had approached me.

1335
02:04:57.24 --> 02:05:06.24
I was happy. I was happy for my friend. He's a great actor. And it was clear to me that he was going to launch into the movie business after we concluded our run of the show.

1336
02:05:06.24 --> 02:05:15.24
And I couldn't help but wondering if a movie role might be in the cards for me also.

1337
02:05:15.24 --> 02:05:22.24
Is there like ego involved in this scenario as it's unfolding? Are you just stoked for your friend?

1338
02:05:22.24 --> 02:05:29.24
No, both. I mean, yeah. You know, we were on stage together the whole time. Two guys.

1339
02:05:29.24 --> 02:05:37.24
One of the parts is very, very flashy. It's a great part. The part that John played.

1340
02:05:37.24 --> 02:05:44.24
The older of the two brothers. And he's like this desert rat. He disappears into the desert and comes out.

1341
02:05:44.24 --> 02:05:52.24
And the other one is a screenwriter. Kind of a little cricket guy. And he's typing and writing. They're very opposite.

1342
02:05:52.24 --> 02:06:01.24
But they sort of during the course of the play. They sort of exchange roles in a way. The screenwriter gets crazier and crazier.

1343
02:06:01.24 --> 02:06:06.24
So the two guys are two great parts. They're both on stage the whole time.

1344
02:06:06.24 --> 02:06:14.24
And I thought, well, and John's coming in and he's saying, you know, I went out with Antonio and last night and Robert Duball and John Casabetti.

1345
02:06:14.24 --> 02:06:23.24
And Gene Hackman was here. Did you see him? I went out with him. And I went to the Greek restaurant by myself.

1346
02:06:23.24 --> 02:06:31.24
It was kind of like that. And a lot of great things were happening for John. It was very exciting. It's a flashy part.

1347
02:06:31.24 --> 02:06:40.24
And he got a lot of attention. I thought maybe, you know, I something like that was in the cards for me. It wasn't.

1348
02:06:40.24 --> 02:06:55.24
But I decided to take some initiative. So I went to the box office and I said, can you give me a list of all the like agents and casting directors, people like that who have been to see the show and they keep tabs on that kind of stuff.

1349
02:06:55.24 --> 02:07:02.24
So they gave me the, the list and I decided to make those calls myself there. They weren't coming to me.

1350
02:07:02.24 --> 02:07:12.24
So I made a call to some agents and I ended up getting an agent in New York and, you know, that would change things a little bit.

1351
02:07:12.24 --> 02:07:20.24
You know, John had a, you know, he rocketed, you know, he was nominated for an Oscar within two years of that play.

1352
02:07:20.24 --> 02:07:28.24
Yeah, that's, I was reading now. I was like, man, this is, I could see where, you know, obviously working with a bunch of companies all the time.

1353
02:07:28.24 --> 02:07:41.24
We always deal with people's egos and I could see where this, this is a classic scenario where you could get mad and, you know, undermine him and do you know, do whatever, like all sorts of bad things can come from this.

1354
02:07:41.24 --> 02:07:46.24
Or you can have a great attitude to be like, hey, awesome for him. That's great.

1355
02:07:46.24 --> 02:07:49.24
No factor move on.

1356
02:07:49.24 --> 02:07:59.24
We, you know, we ended up taping the show at the end of our run. The show ran two years. We did it for the first six months and then I recast it. I was the director too.

1357
02:07:59.24 --> 02:08:02.24
So I recast it with a bunch of different people.

1358
02:08:02.24 --> 02:08:12.24
And we taped it for PBS and an, an erodon PBS. You can see it on the internet. It's called True West. It's kind of Malgavich and Sonies.

1359
02:08:12.24 --> 02:08:22.24
And we taped it and we took four days to shoot it. And then right after that, John went off to Thailand to do his first movie.

1360
02:08:22.24 --> 02:08:37.24
It was called the killing fields and great movie. And he went off played a part in that within, within a couple years. He was in a movie called Places in the Art and got nominated for an Oscar.

1361
02:08:37.24 --> 02:08:47.24
And when he left to go there, I went back to Chicago and eventually took to go over again as artistic director of the company.

1362
02:08:47.24 --> 02:08:55.24
I think that's what you're talking about here from 1982 to 1997. We produced even more shows in Chicago.

1363
02:08:55.24 --> 02:08:57.24
And took more to New York.

1364
02:08:57.24 --> 02:09:02.24
And then in 1990, we opened the grapes of wrath on Broadway.

1365
02:09:02.24 --> 02:09:08.24
That production won us another Tony. And I forget which one won you the first Tony. This time for Best Play.

1366
02:09:08.24 --> 02:09:12.24
And is the Tony is the best thing you can get in theater?

1367
02:09:12.24 --> 02:09:23.24
In New York, it's the big, big award that you can get in. The reason I say another one is in 1985, just a couple years after True West went and we were taking other shows there.

1368
02:09:23.24 --> 02:09:40.24
They gave us an honorary Tony award for Best Regional Theater within a couple years of taking True West then there. And then in 1990 we won for Best Play.

1369
02:09:40.24 --> 02:09:48.24
And that kind of precipitates what's going on here. In 1990 we realized another dream when Steppenwolf broke ground at 1650 North,

1370
02:09:48.24 --> 02:09:56.24
how stood street and built their own multi-million dollar building. We designed our own theater from the ground up and opened the doors not long afterward.

1371
02:09:56.24 --> 02:10:01.24
The land of our birth had allowed us to pursue our dreams, Steppenwolf had truly arrived.

1372
02:10:01.24 --> 02:10:08.24
So you guys were big time now. I mean, if you're building the building, you're doing some good stuff, obviously.

1373
02:10:08.24 --> 02:10:18.24
Yeah, so 82 to 90, right? So during that period in the 80s we became an internationally recognized theater.

1374
02:10:18.24 --> 02:10:28.24
We took shows to London. We took shows to New York. We were getting great press from the international media.

1375
02:10:28.24 --> 02:10:41.24
We went from a local theater that nobody knew about outside of Chicago to an internationally recognized theater which allowed us to attract stronger board members.

1376
02:10:41.24 --> 02:10:53.24
So, you know, reach a wider audience and eventually raise the money to build our own theater from the ground up.

1377
02:10:53.24 --> 02:11:00.24
How many seats did you guys put in the new theater? 520. And now we're building another one right next door.

1378
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:05.24
Right now adding another theater in the round. Still on the move.

1379
02:11:05.24 --> 02:11:12.24
You get Sam, who's Sam Hollywood guy?

1380
02:11:12.24 --> 02:11:16.24
My be Sam Cohen, who was my agent.

1381
02:11:16.24 --> 02:11:27.24
He introduced you a Hollywood producer named David Putnam. Sam called me and said that David wanted to offer you a direct and deal in Hollywood at Columbia.

1382
02:11:27.24 --> 02:11:35.24
David would pay me to move to California. He called David and he was asking you about like how much how much do you think you should get.

1383
02:11:35.24 --> 02:11:46.24
He called David then called back and said David thinks you should get 70,000, 75,000 dollars a year. Okay, by you. I was speechless. 60,000 sounded like a fortune to be much less 75.

1384
02:11:46.24 --> 02:11:51.24
They gave me an office on the back lot of Warner Brothers where Columbia Pictures was based at the time.

1385
02:11:51.24 --> 02:11:58.24
The same lot incidentally that I'd been thrown out of a few years earlier when I tried so hard to see Robert Redford.

1386
02:11:58.24 --> 02:12:08.24
At the time I was still at the time I made the deal. I was still artistic director at Stepan Wolf turned over the reins to Jeff Perry and Randy Arney.

1387
02:12:08.24 --> 02:12:14.24
So now you go out and you're there basically paying you to look for a movie to make. Is that is that what it is?

1388
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:25.24
That's what the first look deal is. If I find a movie that I want to direct, I give it to them first to see it. They can say yes or no.

1389
02:12:25.24 --> 02:12:30.24
Got it. And the movie that you finally come up with is called Farm of the Year.

1390
02:12:30.24 --> 02:12:40.24
Yeah, another studio had that. So I had to go to David Putnam and say look, I found a movie I want to do, but it's at another studio.

1391
02:12:40.24 --> 02:12:48.24
And he said go make it make it great. They had me under contract there and they wanted me to make movies.

1392
02:12:48.24 --> 02:12:56.24
They weren't going to have me hang around and do nothing. I had a movie I wanted to make and it just had to have been to be at a small studio.

1393
02:12:56.24 --> 02:12:59.24
So, Sina Calm?

1394
02:12:59.24 --> 02:13:01.24
Yeah, that was the company.

1395
02:13:01.24 --> 02:13:04.24
They said they're going to put 5 million up to make the movie.

1396
02:13:04.24 --> 02:13:13.24
We shot the movie and see the rapids. I found my transition from theater directing to film directing a little more difficult than I had anticipated.

1397
02:13:13.24 --> 02:13:25.24
Again, I got to skip through some of this. You talk about like some of the challenges you come across. Some of it being that's your first movie and you're not quite a hundred percent sure what you're doing.

1398
02:13:25.24 --> 02:13:36.24
As you're going through all that to add to the pressure in the middle of all this confusion. I received a call from the producers who said the selection committee at cans film festival wanted to see a cut of the movie cans.

1399
02:13:36.24 --> 02:13:44.24
The rap cans means red carpet and paparazzi big movie starts chauffeur to the front door in limousines.

1400
02:13:44.24 --> 02:13:46.24
Echo getting fired up over there.

1401
02:13:46.24 --> 02:13:52.24
Every filmmaker dreams of being in competition to cans. A great reception there can really help a movie out.

1402
02:13:52.24 --> 02:14:03.24
So, that's looking good. The studio execs, execs, decided to fiddle with the title of film changing it from the farm of the year two miles from home.

1403
02:14:03.24 --> 02:14:14.24
So, miles from home comes out and you say here, never found its audience at fell flat earning a grand total of $188,000.

1404
02:14:14.24 --> 02:14:18.24
That's falling flat.

1405
02:14:18.24 --> 02:14:21.24
Yeah. And that's out of a five million dollar investment.

1406
02:14:21.24 --> 02:14:29.24
The experience wasn't all bad for me anyway. Although I'm sure the studio wasn't thrilled. I learned many great lessons.

1407
02:14:29.24 --> 02:14:35.24
I just need to find the right movie. And by the way, our first baby was due just after miles from home closed and theaters.

1408
02:14:35.24 --> 02:14:43.24
The due date was November 8, 1988, Election Day, the year George H. W. Bush ran against Michael Duke Caucus on November 9th.

1409
02:14:43.24 --> 02:14:50.24
We named her Sofia Anna Sanise and called her Sophie.

1410
02:14:50.24 --> 02:15:00.24
In 1990, Moira discovered she was pregnant again this time with a boy. That summer I was acting on Broadway in the grapes of rats and Moira.

1411
02:15:00.24 --> 02:15:07.24
Now six months pregnant was in Chicago doing a play with Stephen Wolf called Love Letters. She's just getting after it.

1412
02:15:07.24 --> 02:15:15.24
In multiple phone calls we discussed what we should name our son one day. The name became clear to me. I called up Moira.

1413
02:15:15.24 --> 02:15:24.24
We should call him Mac after your brother. Moira was thrilled. Boyd, McKenna Mac Harris, the Vietnam vet, Silverstar recipient, West Point instructor passed away in 1983 of cancer.

1414
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:31.24
We all thought of him regularly when our son was born on November 10th, 1990, almost two years to the day after Sophie.

1415
02:15:31.24 --> 02:15:42.24
We named him McKenna Anthony Sanise Mac for short. The Irish and Italian influences surrounded us and sounded very Americany.

1416
02:15:42.24 --> 02:15:51.24
After Mac is born, you know, I'm not going to read this part because people should read it from themselves.

1417
02:15:51.24 --> 02:15:56.24
But you kind of talk about just how everything kind of hits you that you got these two beautiful children.

1418
02:15:56.24 --> 02:16:02.24
You're doing well in life. You've got the beautiful family.

1419
02:16:02.24 --> 02:16:16.24
And you say here, you know, you're driving while this is happening and you're getting emotional. You say as I brush away the tears at the stoplight, I think I whispered a semblance of my first prayer.

1420
02:16:16.24 --> 02:16:19.24
The prayer was hazy, but the intention was clear.

1421
02:16:19.24 --> 02:16:25.24
Called a longing perhaps. The first toinge is a belief two words layered with more than one meaning.

1422
02:16:25.24 --> 02:16:34.24
Thank you.

1423
02:16:34.24 --> 02:16:38.24
You wrap up grapes of wrath on stage.

1424
02:16:38.24 --> 02:16:42.24
And you say here, I searched for what to do next. I knew I wanted to do something epic.

1425
02:16:42.24 --> 02:16:52.24
Something that moved people, preferably another movie. But what? Then a lane-stime back and you talk about where you developed this relationship with her.

1426
02:16:52.24 --> 02:16:58.24
And she was married a John Steinbeck, his widow. She controlled all the rights to his material.

1427
02:16:58.24 --> 02:17:04.24
And you knew her, would you know her from from from working on the grapes of wrath? She gave us the rights to do it.

1428
02:17:04.24 --> 02:17:07.24
And she loved the production. So she we became friends.

1429
02:17:07.24 --> 02:17:14.24
And so a lane had become a real champion of step-in-law. She'd seen that we could take on her husband's novels and handle the stories really well.

1430
02:17:14.24 --> 02:17:20.24
On the last day of shooting the PBS version of grapes of wrath, I stood with a lane during a break out by the theaters back steps.

1431
02:17:20.24 --> 02:17:27.24
I thought about the box car image swallowed sucked up by my courage and said, a lane would you give me the rights to of my son men?

1432
02:17:27.24 --> 02:17:34.24
I'd like to try and make a movie out of it. I paused and added tentatively. I'd need your help too because I don't have any money.

1433
02:17:34.24 --> 02:17:43.24
She chuckled quietly, smiled her beautiful delight, dignified smile and said, well honey, it's already been a film. Three times.

1434
02:17:43.24 --> 02:17:54.24
I got a kick out of that. You end up making the deal. She eventually gives it to you. She gives it to you free of charge by the way, which is shows you that she wasn't pressed with you.

1435
02:17:54.24 --> 02:18:00.24
What you guys had done with her other husband's other material.

1436
02:18:00.24 --> 02:18:08.24
You start you make this movie. You're doing that and actually the day the LA riots touched off.

1437
02:18:08.24 --> 02:18:17.24
I was mixing the sound for of my cemented Sony studios in Culver City. One of the technicians called me into the office and their on STV all hell was breaking loose.

1438
02:18:17.24 --> 02:18:29.24
For the next five days while the riots raged, I tried to work at home while watching the city burn on television. Those are of course the Rodney King riots.

1439
02:18:29.24 --> 02:18:36.24
You get another, another invite to cans.

1440
02:18:36.24 --> 02:18:45.24
It's can. Okay. Sorry. I just talked about me being uncultured. It's calm. It's French.

1441
02:18:45.24 --> 02:18:52.24
All right. So you get another invite to cans. You say how you want to say. Hey, I'm a man.

1442
02:18:52.24 --> 02:18:57.24
There's an ass on the end of it. So you get another invite to con.

1443
02:18:57.24 --> 02:19:12.24
There you go. And on the way on the way from the hotel to the theater, the streets were lined with cheering people at the theater. The red carpet was packed with paparazzi and journalist. Everybody wore tuxedo's or ball gowns flash bulbs popped everywhere.

1444
02:19:12.24 --> 02:19:18.24
As a filmmaker when your movie is being shown, you can't stand in the back and pace, which is what I nervously felt like doing.

1445
02:19:18.24 --> 02:19:24.24
You must sit in the middle of the theater along with the production team in the middle of a gigantic crowd.

1446
02:19:24.24 --> 02:19:31.24
You hope the crowd enjoys the show. If they don't, then you sit there and take your punishment.

1447
02:19:31.24 --> 02:19:38.24
Even if you get booed, and this is my first film as a producer. My second as a director. Only my third as an actor.

1448
02:19:38.24 --> 02:19:44.24
The crowd and I watched the movie. It started just as I envisioned it on a train inside a box car.

1449
02:19:44.24 --> 02:19:50.24
We heard the click at a crack called the train going across the tracks. The story progressed. The movie finished.

1450
02:19:50.24 --> 02:19:55.24
The credits rolled with the lights still down. The plot concludes tragically. Not triumphantly.

1451
02:19:55.24 --> 02:20:00.24
And it's not a movie where you walk away feeling happy. Still the story is deeply moving in powerful.

1452
02:20:00.24 --> 02:20:05.24
And my hope was that after seeing the film viewers might be motivated to do a little more and make sure people aren't alone.

1453
02:20:05.24 --> 02:20:08.24
Abandoned, marginalized, or left on the fringes.

1454
02:20:08.24 --> 02:20:15.24
When the credits began to roll, a little low kept and crept into the auditorium. A tense moment of silence.

1455
02:20:15.24 --> 02:20:24.24
Sometimes the audience waits until the very end of the credits to show their feelings. Sometimes they make their decision with the credits still rolling.

1456
02:20:24.24 --> 02:20:29.24
I felt my skin crawl. Will the audience clap? Will they boo?

1457
02:20:29.24 --> 02:20:39.24
I held my breath waiting for the response. And then it happened. A damn burst. The entire room erupted into applause.

1458
02:20:39.24 --> 02:20:42.24
Huge applause. When the credits still rolling, the audience clapped and clapped.

1459
02:20:42.24 --> 02:20:46.24
One person stood at another. The entire feet are rose to their feet. A standing ovation.

1460
02:20:46.24 --> 02:20:51.24
The team and I stayed in the middle of the crowd. And they brought the house lights up and shine to spotlight on us.

1461
02:20:51.24 --> 02:20:56.24
The crowd continued to count. Clap wildly. They cheered through the entire credits.

1462
02:20:56.24 --> 02:20:59.24
MelcoVitch and I stood and took a bow and wave. The credits ended.

1463
02:20:59.24 --> 02:21:02.24
And nothing appeared on the screen. The audience continued to clap and cheer.

1464
02:21:02.24 --> 02:21:06.24
MelcoVitch and I sat down and took a few moments. The audience continued to clap and cheer.

1465
02:21:06.24 --> 02:21:11.24
Then rushed John and I stood and I saw Tom Selich standing off to one side of the crowd.

1466
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:14.24
I had to leave this in their foreco Charles.

1467
02:21:14.24 --> 02:21:17.24
I saw Tom Selich standing off to one side of the crowd. Claping cheering.

1468
02:21:17.24 --> 02:21:20.24
I didn't know him personally, but I could put out his familiar face anywhere.

1469
02:21:20.24 --> 02:21:25.24
He wore a white toxin as I glanced over Tom caught my eye and smiled and nodded.

1470
02:21:25.24 --> 02:21:29.24
It is only Magnum PI could do. The standing ovation went on and on.

1471
02:21:29.24 --> 02:21:34.24
The noise in the room was deafening. Someone said later, the elvation lasted a full 10 minutes.

1472
02:21:34.24 --> 02:21:37.24
Finally, the clapping wound down and I stood again and the cloud.

1473
02:21:37.24 --> 02:21:41.24
To the crowd, thank you. Thank you so much. Tears filled my eyes.

1474
02:21:41.24 --> 02:21:45.24
I was a wave of emotion. Nearly choked me. We had worked hard.

1475
02:21:45.24 --> 02:21:48.24
This was our moment of truth. It felt spectacular.

1476
02:21:48.24 --> 02:21:52.24
There's a little, I'm not going to go into the full thing, but there's a rush with you.

1477
02:21:52.24 --> 02:21:54.24
And rush was a coper news.

1478
02:21:54.24 --> 02:22:00.24
And rush says, wow. I'm so glad the MGM executives are here to see this.

1479
02:22:00.24 --> 02:22:02.24
It will be really good for the film.

1480
02:22:02.24 --> 02:22:03.24
Or is that you said I said that?

1481
02:22:03.24 --> 02:22:08.24
Okay, so you said, oh yeah, yeah, I looked over a rust and quipped the wow. I'm so glad the MGM executives are here to see this.

1482
02:22:08.24 --> 02:22:10.24
It will be really good for the film.

1483
02:22:10.24 --> 02:22:16.24
And then he says back either that, or I think we just made a French film.

1484
02:22:16.24 --> 02:22:20.24
Which means that's like an artistic film.

1485
02:22:20.24 --> 02:22:26.24
Art house film, which is cool, but not super what profitable.

1486
02:22:26.24 --> 02:22:29.24
Not a lot of people are going to see it.

1487
02:22:29.24 --> 02:22:32.24
I'm sorry.

1488
02:22:32.24 --> 02:22:35.24
Sounds like you were kind of right.

1489
02:22:35.24 --> 02:22:36.24
Kind of?

1490
02:22:36.24 --> 02:22:37.24
I love you.

1491
02:22:37.24 --> 02:22:39.24
You were right.

1492
02:22:39.24 --> 02:22:43.24
Going here, the execs, I mean, this is what company made this, what, what, what, what?

1493
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:49.24
The execs, the MGM execs considered it an artistic success, but I think this is

1494
02:22:49.24 --> 02:22:53.24
Spectamoo. He wasn't going to make much money. So they weren't going to spend much to market it.

1495
02:22:53.24 --> 02:22:58.24
Columbia's a river runs through it, starring Brad Pitt and directed by Robert Redford.

1496
02:22:58.24 --> 02:23:01.24
He started to get hostile towards that.

1497
02:23:01.24 --> 02:23:02.24
I know, man.

1498
02:23:02.24 --> 02:23:07.24
It came out seven days after of Myson Men, and although the stories were different, the heart

1499
02:23:07.24 --> 02:23:14.24
Lentone was similar. A river runs through it went on to win an Oscar and earn 43 million

1500
02:23:14.24 --> 02:23:19.24
of Myson Men receive a 10-minute standing ovation at Khan.

1501
02:23:19.24 --> 02:23:21.24
But gross just over 5 million.

1502
02:23:21.24 --> 02:23:25.24
So yeah, better sweet.

1503
02:23:25.24 --> 02:23:33.24
But I'll tell you, I say in the book, I have no, I was disappointed. Obviously, I wanted

1504
02:23:33.24 --> 02:23:38.24
them to put full page ads in the paper and do a lot more promotion on it.

1505
02:23:38.24 --> 02:23:45.24
But the bottom line is that they gave me $8.8 million to make that movie, to make a Myson

1506
02:23:45.24 --> 02:23:49.24
Nobody thought of Myson Men was going to be a big blockbuster, anything like that.

1507
02:23:49.24 --> 02:23:53.24
But they gave me the money to make it, and they left me alone pretty much when I was

1508
02:23:53.24 --> 02:23:56.24
making it, to make my own decisions and do what I want.

1509
02:23:56.24 --> 02:24:01.24
So I'm very grateful to the IM and Alan Layad and the people there who supported it,

1510
02:24:01.24 --> 02:24:04.24
even though it wasn't a big hit.

1511
02:24:04.24 --> 02:24:09.24
When you see the movie now, you made the movie that you wanted to make, right?

1512
02:24:09.24 --> 02:24:10.24
Yeah.

1513
02:24:10.24 --> 02:24:14.24
You don't look at it now and go, I should have done this, I should have done that.

1514
02:24:14.24 --> 02:24:20.24
Now, you know, I haven't seen it for quite a long time, but the last time I saw

1515
02:24:20.24 --> 02:24:25.24
was with a small group of folks and I felt like the movie holds up.

1516
02:24:25.24 --> 02:24:28.24
It's just sort of a timeless story, you know?

1517
02:24:28.24 --> 02:24:34.24
And the way it's made is not, there's no filmmaking technique that happened to be

1518
02:24:34.24 --> 02:24:39.24
the the the the the the the the the the the time and or anything like that.

1519
02:24:39.24 --> 02:24:41.24
It's shot very straightforward.

1520
02:24:41.24 --> 02:24:45.24
It's pretty to look at the it's about the acting and the story is good.

1521
02:24:45.24 --> 02:24:55.24
And so for that reason, I think it holds up and I've I've received countless letters from high school kids all over the country for the last 30 years.

1522
02:24:55.24 --> 02:25:00.24
Because they they study of my son men in school and then they watch the movie.

1523
02:25:00.24 --> 02:25:06.24
And so more kids have seen that movie than ever saw in the theater when it opened.

1524
02:25:06.24 --> 02:25:08.24
Where can people see it right now?

1525
02:25:08.24 --> 02:25:13.24
Because on Netflix, it probably is and DVDs and that kind of thing.

1526
02:25:13.24 --> 02:25:16.24
Yeah, Netflix. They still make it DVDs echo.

1527
02:25:16.24 --> 02:25:18.24
I don't don't think I have those.

1528
02:25:18.24 --> 02:25:20.24
You don't know anything about that thing.

1529
02:25:20.24 --> 02:25:21.24
You know what that is.

1530
02:25:21.24 --> 02:25:24.24
That thing better be a well people are going to watch it now.

1531
02:25:24.24 --> 02:25:28.24
It's a good movie and Malcolm it's is isn't it.

1532
02:25:28.24 --> 02:25:31.24
We play George and landing in it's a good man.

1533
02:25:31.24 --> 02:25:33.24
I'm proud of it.

1534
02:25:33.24 --> 02:25:39.24
Six weeks before the opening of my son men our third child was due born August 20th, 1992.

1535
02:25:39.24 --> 02:25:46.24
Ella was our smallest baby and two weeks after the after her birth we sat at an appointment with our pediatrician.

1536
02:25:46.24 --> 02:25:50.24
She listened to Ella's little heart and said I want you to go see a cardiologist right away.

1537
02:25:50.24 --> 02:25:54.24
There's something odd in Ella's heartbeat.

1538
02:25:54.24 --> 02:26:00.24
I tell you when a pediatrician says that your life clouds with fear.

1539
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:03.24
So you guys take her to the cardiologist and all kinds of tests.

1540
02:26:03.24 --> 02:26:06.24
They find out that she's got some issues.

1541
02:26:06.24 --> 02:26:11.24
And they say that they want to see what happens over time.

1542
02:26:11.24 --> 02:26:14.24
She got some holes in her heart.

1543
02:26:14.24 --> 02:26:18.24
But sometimes the holes close up on their own and they want to see what's going to happen.

1544
02:26:18.24 --> 02:26:21.24
And when I say they want to see what's going to happen to say years that they want to wait.

1545
02:26:21.24 --> 02:26:22.24
Yeah.

1546
02:26:22.24 --> 02:26:24.24
Are you sweating the entire time?

1547
02:26:24.24 --> 02:26:27.24
Are you constantly in fear?

1548
02:26:27.24 --> 02:26:32.24
No because we would have regular appointments with the cardiologist.

1549
02:26:32.24 --> 02:26:40.24
And he would just listen and see eventually and they would take pictures and look at what happened.

1550
02:26:40.24 --> 02:26:47.24
Eventually when she was five years old there were three holes when she was born in her heart.

1551
02:26:47.24 --> 02:26:51.24
Two of them closed up by the time she was five years old.

1552
02:26:51.24 --> 02:26:58.24
And the last one, the biggest of the three, they said it's not going to close on its own.

1553
02:26:58.24 --> 02:27:02.24
We're going to have to do surgery on it.

1554
02:27:02.24 --> 02:27:07.24
So that now we're dealing with our little five year old having heart surgery.

1555
02:27:07.24 --> 02:27:11.24
And that then it was scary.

1556
02:27:11.24 --> 02:27:12.24
Yeah.

1557
02:27:12.24 --> 02:27:16.24
But these heart surgeons are very remarkable.

1558
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:20.24
And we had a remarkable heart surgeon who took very good care of her.

1559
02:27:20.24 --> 02:27:24.24
And she was home within two days, I think of the surgery.

1560
02:27:24.24 --> 02:27:28.24
You know, she's perfect.

1561
02:27:28.24 --> 02:27:32.24
About five years later, we had to take her to the cardiologist.

1562
02:27:32.24 --> 02:27:33.24
He kept checking.

1563
02:27:33.24 --> 02:27:35.24
Five years later we went in.

1564
02:27:35.24 --> 02:27:37.24
She's about ten years old and he said I've got good news and bad news.

1565
02:27:37.24 --> 02:27:40.24
The good news is everything's good.

1566
02:27:40.24 --> 02:27:41.24
Your heart's great.

1567
02:27:41.24 --> 02:27:44.24
The bad news is you don't have to see me anymore.

1568
02:27:44.24 --> 02:27:51.24
So we stopped taking her and she's a beautiful, beautiful girl married now.

1569
02:27:51.24 --> 02:27:56.24
Her little baby.

1570
02:27:56.24 --> 02:28:04.24
Yeah, on the back drop of that, I couldn't, I couldn't not read this part.

1571
02:28:04.24 --> 02:28:09.24
In the fall of 1992, my agent set up a general meeting for me to sit down with Steven Spielberg,

1572
02:28:09.24 --> 02:28:16.24
as a director and producer, Steven Spielberg was already legendary having pulled off a string of blockbusters, including jaws.

1573
02:28:16.24 --> 02:28:18.24
Which I could just stop right there.

1574
02:28:18.24 --> 02:28:23.24
Does anybody that knows me? He knows that when I was a kid, videotape machines had just come out.

1575
02:28:23.24 --> 02:28:33.24
And my dad got a videotape machine and we had, so like we probably had three movies on videotape.

1576
02:28:33.24 --> 02:28:35.24
A one of them is jaws.

1577
02:28:35.24 --> 02:28:40.24
We watched that continually for years.

1578
02:28:40.24 --> 02:28:42.24
We call them VCRs.

1579
02:28:42.24 --> 02:28:44.24
We don't say video tape machines.

1580
02:28:44.24 --> 02:28:45.24
Okay.

1581
02:28:45.24 --> 02:28:47.24
We don't say that video cassette recorder.

1582
02:28:47.24 --> 02:28:48.24
VCR.

1583
02:28:48.24 --> 02:28:50.24
So we had that.

1584
02:28:50.24 --> 02:28:53.24
So jaws close in counters of the third kind.

1585
02:28:53.24 --> 02:28:55.24
Raiders of the large, lost arc.

1586
02:28:55.24 --> 02:28:56.24
E.T.

1587
02:28:56.24 --> 02:28:57.24
The extra terrestrial.

1588
02:28:57.24 --> 02:28:58.24
Steven asked me what I was doing.

1589
02:28:58.24 --> 02:29:00.24
I told him about of my cement.

1590
02:29:00.24 --> 02:29:01.24
He said, I'd love to see it.

1591
02:29:01.24 --> 02:29:02.24
Will you show it to me?

1592
02:29:02.24 --> 02:29:03.24
Just bring it over to my house.

1593
02:29:03.24 --> 02:29:04.24
I've got a screening room there.

1594
02:29:04.24 --> 02:29:05.24
We'll watch it together.

1595
02:29:05.24 --> 02:29:07.24
And I said, of course.

1596
02:29:07.24 --> 02:29:09.24
We set up the screening.

1597
02:29:09.24 --> 02:29:11.24
Just outside the theater and Steven's house.

1598
02:29:11.24 --> 02:29:15.24
He had a little lobby with a popcorn machine and a candy counter.

1599
02:29:15.24 --> 02:29:23.24
His wife Kate Capshaw joined us and we all grabbed some popcorn and sodas and sat down to watch of mice and men together.

1600
02:29:23.24 --> 02:29:24.24
They was surreal.

1601
02:29:24.24 --> 02:29:25.24
Steven and Kate were both very gracious.

1602
02:29:25.24 --> 02:29:27.24
They love the movie.

1603
02:29:27.24 --> 02:29:29.24
Afterwards, we stood outside their home, saying,

1604
02:29:29.24 --> 02:29:34.24
I'm going to take Kate and me a little hug and Steven turned to me while I racked my brain.

1605
02:29:34.24 --> 02:29:35.24
Think Gary, think.

1606
02:29:35.24 --> 02:29:39.24
I was desperate to ask Steven one brilliant question.

1607
02:29:39.24 --> 02:29:42.24
But all I could muster was Steven.

1608
02:29:42.24 --> 02:29:44.24
How do you know where to put the camera?

1609
02:29:44.24 --> 02:29:49.24
He chuckled and said, I just watched a lot of movies.

1610
02:29:49.24 --> 02:29:54.24
So simple, so profound to become a great filmmaker.

1611
02:29:54.24 --> 02:29:56.24
You must study the greats.

1612
02:29:56.24 --> 02:29:57.24
You learn to steal.

1613
02:29:57.24 --> 02:29:59.24
You learn to steal from people you admire.

1614
02:29:59.24 --> 02:30:02.24
Over the years, I'd endlessly studied actors I admired Al Pacino.

1615
02:30:02.24 --> 02:30:09.24
Jack Nicholson, Jean Hackman, De Niro, Void, Duval, Hoffman, Brando, many others.

1616
02:30:09.24 --> 02:30:14.24
Steven took this last sip of soda and added, oh, and Gary, based on what I just saw in my

1617
02:30:14.24 --> 02:30:19.24
Submen, you should definitely keep directing.

1618
02:30:19.24 --> 02:30:20.24
Directing.

1619
02:30:20.24 --> 02:30:24.24
Now, you go on a little bit for these that I couldn't have known was just over the horizon.

1620
02:30:24.24 --> 02:30:27.24
It was an amazing opportunity for me when I would open a new world,

1621
02:30:27.24 --> 02:30:34.24
and not only enacting incidentally, after completing of my Submen, I haven't directed a movie since.

1622
02:30:34.24 --> 02:30:36.24
Yeah.

1623
02:30:36.24 --> 02:30:37.24
That was it.

1624
02:30:37.24 --> 02:30:38.24
Yeah.

1625
02:30:38.24 --> 02:30:42.24
You know, I often tell the story that like I the reason I started a podcast was because Tim Ferris,

1626
02:30:42.24 --> 02:30:47.24
who was a very popular podcaster in Joe Rogan, who's a very popular podcaster, both told me to

1627
02:30:47.24 --> 02:30:48.24
start a podcast.

1628
02:30:48.24 --> 02:30:50.24
I listened to them.

1629
02:30:50.24 --> 02:30:53.24
If Steven, see, will work, would it told me to direct more?

1630
02:30:53.24 --> 02:30:54.24
I might listen.

1631
02:30:54.24 --> 02:30:56.24
No offense, Gary.

1632
02:30:56.24 --> 02:30:58.24
Well, what happened?

1633
02:30:58.24 --> 02:31:00.24
You know, it's a...

1634
02:31:00.24 --> 02:31:04.24
Kept me away from direct because what happened next.

1635
02:31:04.24 --> 02:31:05.24
Yeah.

1636
02:31:05.24 --> 02:31:15.24
But the Steven King, you get a role, a big role in that Steven King.

1637
02:31:15.24 --> 02:31:16.24
What, many series?

1638
02:31:16.24 --> 02:31:17.24
It was a...

1639
02:31:17.24 --> 02:31:20.24
Yeah, it was like a...

1640
02:31:20.24 --> 02:31:22.24
Four-night mini series.

1641
02:31:22.24 --> 02:31:23.24
Yeah.

1642
02:31:23.24 --> 02:31:24.24
And this is bad hours worth.

1643
02:31:24.24 --> 02:31:26.24
This is back in the day where they would...

1644
02:31:26.24 --> 02:31:28.24
When they would do that, they'd play them like four nights in a row.

1645
02:31:28.24 --> 02:31:29.24
That's right.

1646
02:31:29.24 --> 02:31:30.24
Yeah.

1647
02:31:30.24 --> 02:31:31.24
Get America.

1648
02:31:31.24 --> 02:31:32.24
It was a huge rating.

1649
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:35.24
I mean, millions and millions of people watched it.

1650
02:31:35.24 --> 02:31:36.24
Yeah.

1651
02:31:36.24 --> 02:31:40.24
You know, overnight I was a recognizable guy.

1652
02:31:40.24 --> 02:31:42.24
That was a huge deal.

1653
02:31:42.24 --> 02:31:43.24
Yeah.

1654
02:31:43.24 --> 02:31:44.24
Yeah.

1655
02:31:44.24 --> 02:31:50.24
This year, this particular year, 1994, when the Stan came out, was...

1656
02:31:50.24 --> 02:31:53.24
Turned the whole career into a different thing.

1657
02:31:53.24 --> 02:31:57.24
And especially for my acting, as I said.

1658
02:31:57.24 --> 02:32:03.24
I never... I was never a frustrated... I was acting.

1659
02:32:03.24 --> 02:32:05.24
But I really wanted to be directing.

1660
02:32:05.24 --> 02:32:07.24
It wasn't anything like that.

1661
02:32:07.24 --> 02:32:10.24
The directing I did because I loved acting.

1662
02:32:10.24 --> 02:32:12.24
I wanted to put myself in a...

1663
02:32:12.24 --> 02:32:15.24
I think Mel Gibson.

1664
02:32:15.24 --> 02:32:16.24
Sure.

1665
02:32:16.24 --> 02:32:19.24
Did he win an Academy Award for...

1666
02:32:19.24 --> 02:32:20.24
Braveheart?

1667
02:32:20.24 --> 02:32:21.24
Yeah.

1668
02:32:21.24 --> 02:32:22.24
He directed it, right?

1669
02:32:22.24 --> 02:32:23.24
Yeah.

1670
02:32:23.24 --> 02:32:31.24
And I think I saw a clip of his speech when he won the Academy Award for directing that movie.

1671
02:32:31.24 --> 02:32:33.24
And he said something along the lines of,

1672
02:32:33.24 --> 02:32:37.24
Now I'm going to go back to doing what all directors want to do.

1673
02:32:37.24 --> 02:32:39.24
Act.

1674
02:32:39.24 --> 02:32:41.24
Pretty clever.

1675
02:32:41.24 --> 02:32:47.24
The Stan cost more than $28 million to produce was well promoted, received good reviews,

1676
02:32:47.24 --> 02:32:50.24
and ended up winning a few Emmy Awards.

1677
02:32:50.24 --> 02:32:53.24
We finished shooting in June and returned to California, then another call came.

1678
02:32:53.24 --> 02:32:58.24
This one, an addition in a Paramount picture to play the part of a wounded Vietnam veteran.

1679
02:32:58.24 --> 02:33:03.24
The movie's working title was simply the name of the main character, forest gump.

1680
02:33:03.24 --> 02:33:05.24
From the start, I wanted this role.

1681
02:33:05.24 --> 02:33:08.24
Any project that that would be a nom or an interesting me.

1682
02:33:08.24 --> 02:33:10.24
Due to the work I'd done in the 1980s with Vietnam vets,

1683
02:33:10.24 --> 02:33:13.24
in addition to my close connection with Vietnam vets and my family.

1684
02:33:13.24 --> 02:33:17.24
The innovative director, Robert, how do you say his name?

1685
02:33:17.24 --> 02:33:18.24
Is it mechus?

1686
02:33:18.24 --> 02:33:20.24
The mechus?

1687
02:33:20.24 --> 02:33:21.24
Is it mechus?

1688
02:33:21.24 --> 02:33:22.24
The mechus?

1689
02:33:22.24 --> 02:33:24.24
There you go.

1690
02:33:24.24 --> 02:33:25.24
Roger RAMIN.

1691
02:33:25.24 --> 02:33:29.24
Just kind of FYI, I echoed scene in most movies I haven't.

1692
02:33:29.24 --> 02:33:33.24
Oh here we go.

1693
02:33:33.24 --> 02:33:35.24
You call the Daqa.

1694
02:33:35.24 --> 02:33:38.24
He'd had a string of hits, including back to the future.

1695
02:33:38.24 --> 02:33:42.24
Romance in the stone, who framed Roger Rhabbert, Rabbit?

1696
02:33:42.24 --> 02:33:44.24
Would have held in the film.

1697
02:33:44.24 --> 02:33:50.84
at the right patient on a 1986 novel by Vietnam veteran, Winston at Grume, was set to start

1698
02:33:50.84 --> 02:33:55.52
Tom Hanks and the screenplay adapted by Eric Roth and other wonderful writer.

1699
02:33:55.52 --> 02:33:59.16
I knew it stood a chance of being a terrific project all around, but I didn't get the

1700
02:33:59.16 --> 02:34:02.16
role at first.

1701
02:34:02.16 --> 02:34:05.80
So why didn't you get the role at first?

1702
02:34:05.80 --> 02:34:09.40
Well, I didn't hear about it for quite a while.

1703
02:34:09.40 --> 02:34:10.40
I auditioned.

1704
02:34:10.40 --> 02:34:15.16
You still don't know.

1705
02:34:15.16 --> 02:34:18.32
And then I kept asking my agency a no, did they say anything?

1706
02:34:18.32 --> 02:34:19.32
Did they cast it?

1707
02:34:19.32 --> 02:34:19.48
No, they haven't casted, they haven't made up of their mind yet.

1708
02:34:19.48 --> 02:34:21.88
So you know, you gotta go forward.

1709
02:34:21.88 --> 02:34:24.04
I can't wait around to find out.

1710
02:34:24.04 --> 02:34:25.04
I didn't get the part.

1711
02:34:25.04 --> 02:34:27.44
So I started auditioning for other things.

1712
02:34:27.44 --> 02:34:30.36
So you auditioned for Little Buddha?

1713
02:34:30.36 --> 02:34:33.16
You auditioned for Why It Up?

1714
02:34:33.16 --> 02:34:37.52
You auditioned for a Disney movie called Tall Tale.

1715
02:34:37.52 --> 02:34:42.08
Then you're all set to say yes to Tall Tale back to the book when the phone rang.

1716
02:34:42.08 --> 02:34:46.68
I landed the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor in Forest Gump.

1717
02:34:46.68 --> 02:34:49.36
It would mean I'd need to turn down the Disney movie.

1718
02:34:49.36 --> 02:34:51.40
Did I still want Forest Gump?

1719
02:34:51.40 --> 02:34:52.72
Moira and I talked it over.

1720
02:34:52.72 --> 02:34:55.88
We decided I needed to place my bets with Forest Gump.

1721
02:34:55.88 --> 02:35:00.16
Plus I really wanted to play the role of a Vietnam veteran while she took the role of the

1722
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:02.16
mother in a Tall Tale.

1723
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:05.68
Yeah, we auditioned together for Tall Tale.

1724
02:35:05.68 --> 02:35:09.12
She got the part of the mother and I got the part of the father.

1725
02:35:09.12 --> 02:35:14.68
But then Lieutenant Dan came along and I had to say, honey, I think I should do this one.

1726
02:35:14.68 --> 02:35:17.20
You go to that one and that's what we did.

1727
02:35:17.20 --> 02:35:20.68
That's a smart move, kind of hedging your bets a little bit.

1728
02:35:20.68 --> 02:35:25.64
I think it was a right moment.

1729
02:35:25.64 --> 02:35:31.12
You say here, I wanted to give all to my character of the wounded Vietnam veteran.

1730
02:35:31.12 --> 02:35:36.96
So I began reading the 1992 Pulitzer Prize winning autobiography, Fortune at Sonne, by Lewis

1731
02:35:36.96 --> 02:35:41.28
Polar, Jr., United States Marine Corps officer who had been severely injured when he stepped

1732
02:35:41.28 --> 02:35:43.24
on a booby trap bomb.

1733
02:35:43.24 --> 02:35:46.64
Both his legs were vaporized and he lost his left hand and nearly all of his fingers

1734
02:35:46.64 --> 02:35:50.48
on his right.

1735
02:35:50.48 --> 02:35:55.64
Polar was the son of the most decorated Marine officer in the history of the Marine Corps.

1736
02:35:55.64 --> 02:35:57.80
Chesty Polar.

1737
02:35:57.80 --> 02:36:02.56
If you are listening to this and you don't know that story, then you should immediately

1738
02:36:02.56 --> 02:36:09.32
go and listen to podcast number 121, 122 and 123.

1739
02:36:09.32 --> 02:36:14.84
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

1740
02:36:14.84 --> 02:36:23.72
So obviously you picked a heavy book to try and figure out what kind of emotions, what

1741
02:36:23.72 --> 02:36:29.56
kind of person Lieutenant Dan was going to be.

1742
02:36:29.56 --> 02:36:31.20
Now you do your little boot camp thing.

1743
02:36:31.20 --> 02:36:34.20
This is sort of an official military movie thing nowadays.

1744
02:36:34.20 --> 02:36:38.28
That if you're going to do a military movie, you're going to do some kind of military boot camp.

1745
02:36:38.28 --> 02:36:43.08
You guys head back to the book, headed into the woods for four days with other actors in

1746
02:36:43.08 --> 02:36:47.24
Lieutenant Dan's Paltoon to train with Techno Wood Advisor named Dale Die, a decorated

1747
02:36:47.24 --> 02:36:52.16
Vietnam veteran who I've been playing tag with to come on the podcast.

1748
02:36:52.16 --> 02:36:55.56
Captain Die at certainly United States Marine Corps and trained the actors for Paltoon as well

1749
02:36:55.56 --> 02:36:58.88
as serving as a tech advisor for many other military movies over the years.

1750
02:36:58.88 --> 02:37:03.52
He put us through our paces, sound like he ran you guys through some good training.

1751
02:37:03.52 --> 02:37:04.52
Oh yeah.

1752
02:37:04.52 --> 02:37:06.52
You guys had a good time?

1753
02:37:06.52 --> 02:37:07.52
No, yeah.

1754
02:37:07.52 --> 02:37:08.52
I learned a lot from Dale.

1755
02:37:08.52 --> 02:37:11.08
It was important.

1756
02:37:11.08 --> 02:37:12.08
And he pushed me.

1757
02:37:12.08 --> 02:37:15.52
He pushed me as Lieutenant Dan.

1758
02:37:15.52 --> 02:37:20.60
So the military part of the character really was, you know, I kind of thought about my

1759
02:37:20.60 --> 02:37:27.60
brother-in-law Mac quite a bit leading a Platoon in Vietnam, which he did.

1760
02:37:27.60 --> 02:37:34.76
And Dale sort of pulled that Lieutenant leader out of me and helped me sort of galvanize

1761
02:37:34.76 --> 02:37:36.68
that soldier part of the character.

1762
02:37:36.68 --> 02:37:38.68
This is a couple of different parts of the character.

1763
02:37:38.68 --> 02:37:44.52
There's the soldier, everything pre-injury and then there's Lieutenant Dan in the

1764
02:37:44.52 --> 02:37:52.28
throws of despair and kind of withdrawing from life and all of that kind of different

1765
02:37:52.28 --> 02:37:57.20
long air and the beer stuff.

1766
02:37:57.20 --> 02:38:02.28
It's, you decided that he went to VMI.

1767
02:38:02.28 --> 02:38:03.76
Is that this character?

1768
02:38:03.76 --> 02:38:04.76
Yeah.

1769
02:38:04.76 --> 02:38:05.76
Instead of West Point.

1770
02:38:05.76 --> 02:38:06.76
Why'd you pick VMI instead of West Point?

1771
02:38:06.76 --> 02:38:09.20
I wanted a little bit of an accent.

1772
02:38:09.20 --> 02:38:10.20
I don't know.

1773
02:38:10.20 --> 02:38:11.20
Okay.

1774
02:38:11.20 --> 02:38:17.64
I mean, I could have gone to West Point, but then, well, why do you sound like this?

1775
02:38:17.64 --> 02:38:22.12
I had a little bit of a little bit of a drone as Lieutenant Dan.

1776
02:38:22.12 --> 02:38:28.96
And I just decided, let's have him be sort of from that part of the country.

1777
02:38:28.96 --> 02:38:33.84
You talk here, Lieutenant Dan meets Bubba and Forests and gives them a few lessons on how

1778
02:38:33.84 --> 02:38:37.28
to be able to feel the meeting is the first image viewer see of Lieutenant Dan.

1779
02:38:37.28 --> 02:38:42.24
He's on the way to the outhouse toilet paper in hand wearing only boxer shorts and flip

1780
02:38:42.24 --> 02:38:43.24
flops.

1781
02:38:43.24 --> 02:38:48.52
The shot was made strategically because we wanted viewers to first see Lieutenant Dan standing

1782
02:38:48.52 --> 02:38:49.92
on two good legs.

1783
02:38:49.92 --> 02:38:51.84
Those legs would soon be gone.

1784
02:38:51.84 --> 02:38:55.40
During the shooting of the Vietnam scenes, I invited my brother and log jacked tree.

1785
02:38:55.40 --> 02:38:58.20
So, you'd been a combat medic and Vietnam.

1786
02:38:58.20 --> 02:39:02.48
The costume designer had issued me a set of dog tags, but when Jack was in Vietnam, he'd

1787
02:39:02.48 --> 02:39:07.24
made a set of rosary beads out of string and rope and hung his dog tags on it.

1788
02:39:07.24 --> 02:39:10.52
Let me wear his actual dog tags and rosary in the movie.

1789
02:39:10.52 --> 02:39:17.60
Jack wasn't Catholic, but he told me that Vietnam, he wanted all the help he could get.

1790
02:39:17.60 --> 02:39:21.08
That's awesome.

1791
02:39:21.08 --> 02:39:22.68
I wish I had those.

1792
02:39:22.68 --> 02:39:25.84
I lost him along the way.

1793
02:39:25.84 --> 02:39:31.80
I have the original ones that they issued me that the designers issued me, that I never

1794
02:39:31.80 --> 02:39:34.60
wore and they were hanging in my office.

1795
02:39:34.60 --> 02:39:37.44
But he lost the dang rosary beads.

1796
02:39:37.44 --> 02:39:38.44
That's nice to see you.

1797
02:39:38.44 --> 02:39:39.44
You're a long way.

1798
02:39:39.44 --> 02:39:42.04
I wish I had him.

1799
02:39:42.04 --> 02:39:43.04
You can see him.

1800
02:39:43.04 --> 02:39:44.68
They were his and Vietnam.

1801
02:39:44.68 --> 02:39:49.28
He was just glad because you can see the movie and you can see him.

1802
02:39:49.28 --> 02:39:54.20
When you mentioned that, I was like, oh wow.

1803
02:39:54.20 --> 02:40:00.32
I think that's such an iconic role and everybody sees the dog tags all the time in every

1804
02:40:00.32 --> 02:40:05.84
warm movie and then you see those dog tags and they're different and they stand out.

1805
02:40:05.84 --> 02:40:10.20
It's a part of the role.

1806
02:40:10.20 --> 02:40:18.16
You talk a lot more about the movie and how the behind the scenes and people should

1807
02:40:18.16 --> 02:40:19.48
get the book to read those.

1808
02:40:19.48 --> 02:40:24.32
I'm going to skip through some of that forest gump came out on July 6, 1994, was an instant

1809
02:40:24.32 --> 02:40:25.56
box office smash hit.

1810
02:40:25.56 --> 02:40:30.12
I couldn't tell you exactly why the film worked to the degree it did but it played to a lot

1811
02:40:30.12 --> 02:40:33.32
of different emotions covered a lot of territory, had level of characters at the center

1812
02:40:33.32 --> 02:40:38.24
of it anchored by Tom as forest and Sally Fields as his mom.

1813
02:40:38.24 --> 02:40:44.08
When forest gump crossed a hundred million mark, Paramount sent gifts to the cast and producers

1814
02:40:44.08 --> 02:40:50.08
an Apple computer each, a nod to the scene where forest invests in some kind of fruit

1815
02:40:50.08 --> 02:40:51.40
company.

1816
02:40:51.40 --> 02:40:55.16
And the movie crossed 200 million mark, Paramount sent another gift.

1817
02:40:55.16 --> 02:41:01.000
I forgot what it was now when it crossed the 300 million dollar mark Bob Zemeckis and

1818
02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.52
called and said Steven Spielberg wanted to take Moira, me, Tom and Tom's wife read a

1819
02:41:06.52 --> 02:41:09.04
Wilson out to dinner to celebrate it wasn't.

1820
02:41:09.04 --> 02:41:14.08
I wasn't typically piling around with high-powered Hollywood rollers so it felt good to

1821
02:41:14.08 --> 02:41:15.08
be included.

1822
02:41:15.08 --> 02:41:19.88
A couple of days later Paramount sent another gift, a giant replica of a park bench of the

1823
02:41:19.88 --> 02:41:21.52
park bench featured in the film.

1824
02:41:21.52 --> 02:41:27.44
The base was made from concrete, it must have weighed 450 pounds.

1825
02:41:27.44 --> 02:41:32.60
Forest gump garnered along list of awards including 13 Academy Award nominations and six

1826
02:41:32.60 --> 02:41:37.64
wins including a win for best picture I received an Oscar nomination for best supporting

1827
02:41:37.64 --> 02:41:42.64
actor.

1828
02:41:42.64 --> 02:41:47.12
Were you now big time?

1829
02:41:47.12 --> 02:41:50.12
Things had changed.

1830
02:41:50.12 --> 02:41:54.68
I was in the biggest many series of the year and two months later, Forest Gump came

1831
02:41:54.68 --> 02:41:56.96
out and it was the biggest movie of the year.

1832
02:41:56.96 --> 02:42:02.40
And got a lot of recognition from that and that all 10 to change a career.

1833
02:42:02.40 --> 02:42:09.52
Had a lot of good opportunities happen, good roles came along after that over the next

1834
02:42:09.52 --> 02:42:11.84
several years.

1835
02:42:11.84 --> 02:42:19.24
Apollo 13 up next, this was an interesting part as this as the words coming out about

1836
02:42:19.24 --> 02:42:24.32
Apollo 13 being made, who's a being made by Ron Howard.

1837
02:42:24.32 --> 02:42:31.12
And you say I usually need to get a call back from an audition but Tom had vouched for

1838
02:42:31.12 --> 02:42:35.56
me and when Ron came to the premiere of Forest Gump he met me in the lobby and said, really

1839
02:42:35.56 --> 02:42:36.56
great job.

1840
02:42:36.56 --> 02:42:40.28
I'm glad I cast you and just like that I was set to be in Apollo 13.

1841
02:42:40.28 --> 02:42:47.64
Yeah, I just met Ron shortly before the premiere of Forest Gump and he put me in the movie

1842
02:42:47.64 --> 02:42:54.64
and it was going to be Tom's next movie and he came to the premiere and he said, well,

1843
02:42:54.64 --> 02:42:56.36
I'm glad you were.

1844
02:42:56.36 --> 02:43:01.28
Because he obviously liked Lieutenant Dan and the job I did in the movie.

1845
02:43:01.28 --> 02:43:06.04
Apollo 13 came out on June 30, 1995 as a big hit garnering, stellar reviews and eventually

1846
02:43:06.04 --> 02:43:11.44
bringing more than 350 million worldwide, it was nominated for nine Oscars, including

1847
02:43:11.44 --> 02:43:15.88
Best Picture and one, two along with the host of other awards.

1848
02:43:15.88 --> 02:43:21.40
Ron Howard's next movie was a crime thriller called Ransom.

1849
02:43:21.40 --> 02:43:26.48
Ron asked me to play the villain detective gone bad named Jimmy Shaker, who kidnapped

1850
02:43:26.48 --> 02:43:31.56
some Mel Gibson's young son and holds him for Ransom.

1851
02:43:31.56 --> 02:43:36.12
And the end, Ransom was a big hit.

1852
02:43:36.12 --> 02:43:38.56
Critics like the movie, very different film for Ron Howard, a tense, a sensible drama

1853
02:43:38.56 --> 02:43:41.60
that ended up burning more than 309 million dollars at the box office.

1854
02:43:41.60 --> 02:43:47.88
And again, you're going to a lot of details, really interesting stuff that I'm skipping

1855
02:43:47.88 --> 02:43:51.60
through because I don't want this to be a 14-hour podcast.

1856
02:43:51.60 --> 02:43:54.88
Yeah, you don't want to go through my whole career.

1857
02:43:54.88 --> 02:44:03.20
Every thing I've done, you, and a lot of movies in there.

1858
02:44:03.20 --> 02:44:07.20
No, it's you are on a roll though.

1859
02:44:07.20 --> 02:44:16.20
What I was thinking about is, if you're in that Hollywood scene, let's face it, when you

1860
02:44:16.20 --> 02:44:22.36
go and apply to be Lieutenant Dan, there's got to be a hundred people that could play

1861
02:44:22.36 --> 02:44:24.08
that role.

1862
02:44:24.08 --> 02:44:27.20
And maybe then wouldn't do it exactly the same as you, but maybe it wouldn't be quite

1863
02:44:27.20 --> 02:44:30.76
as good, maybe it'd be a little better, maybe a little bit of a worse, but the chances

1864
02:44:30.76 --> 02:44:34.64
of you getting a roll have got to be microscopic.

1865
02:44:34.64 --> 02:44:40.04
Well, you know, that's, I think that's one of the reasons I didn't tell me right away

1866
02:44:40.04 --> 02:44:41.04
that I got it.

1867
02:44:41.04 --> 02:44:44.96
It was two or three weeks because they were seeing a lot of different people.

1868
02:44:44.96 --> 02:44:51.04
And they were, I heard that Bruce Willis was toying with the idea of doing the part at

1869
02:44:51.04 --> 02:44:56.88
one point in there, they were probably going through a list of should we get recognizable

1870
02:44:56.88 --> 02:44:59.28
actors to play this role.

1871
02:44:59.28 --> 02:45:03.20
And they decided to, you know, I did a good audition for it.

1872
02:45:03.20 --> 02:45:05.92
They decided to go with a newcomer.

1873
02:45:05.92 --> 02:45:11.92
I mean, I don't only done a few, a few parts, but I did have, you know, I did have

1874
02:45:11.92 --> 02:45:16.24
of Myson Men, and they could see that I was kind of a serious guy.

1875
02:45:16.24 --> 02:45:17.40
I produced the movie.

1876
02:45:17.40 --> 02:45:20.000
I acted in it and I directed it.

1877
02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.24
So I think that, that, that caught their attention a little bit.

1878
02:45:25.24 --> 02:45:26.24
Tough business.

1879
02:45:26.24 --> 02:45:27.24
No, yeah.

1880
02:45:27.24 --> 02:45:28.24
No.

1881
02:45:28.24 --> 02:45:32.04
Because there's a thousand people that would want to play in that movie.

1882
02:45:32.04 --> 02:45:33.04
They didn't get it.

1883
02:45:33.04 --> 02:45:35.64
There's only one person that gets it crazy.

1884
02:45:35.64 --> 02:45:37.88
I was lucky to get it.

1885
02:45:37.88 --> 02:45:38.32
Good fortune.

1886
02:45:38.32 --> 02:45:44.92
Uh, you jump into this next chapter.

1887
02:45:44.92 --> 02:45:46.36
It's called Darkness and Light.

1888
02:45:46.36 --> 02:45:51.36
It's the name of the chapter.

1889
02:45:51.36 --> 02:45:52.08
Very common theme on this podcast.

1890
02:45:52.08 --> 02:45:54.24
Part of part in getting into the chapter a little bit.

1891
02:45:54.24 --> 02:45:59.64
You say back in the mid 1970s, a young, incredibly talented theater student joined us at

1892
02:45:59.64 --> 02:46:03.88
those early meetings held at Illinois State University to discuss the creation of Step

1893
02:46:03.88 --> 02:46:04.88
and Wolf.

1894
02:46:04.88 --> 02:46:09.26
As one of the meetings was winding down, she pulled the fifth, the scotch out of her

1895
02:46:09.26 --> 02:46:11.36
person and now it's come on everyone, let's go.

1896
02:46:11.36 --> 02:46:12.36
Everybody laughed.

1897
02:46:12.36 --> 02:46:17.40
We were all in a partying, pottenbus were always available on college campuses and the fact

1898
02:46:17.40 --> 02:46:21.92
that this young theater student kept a bottle of whiskey and her purse didn't seem unusual

1899
02:46:21.92 --> 02:46:23.80
to any of us.

1900
02:46:23.80 --> 02:46:28.12
That student was Moira before I knew her very well and I drank and partyed right

1901
02:46:28.12 --> 02:46:32.56
along with her and the rest of our friends in those days.

1902
02:46:32.56 --> 02:46:36.92
Over the years, I've known many wonderful performers who are explosive and funny on stage,

1903
02:46:36.92 --> 02:46:41.68
but who are shy, fearful, reserved and even a bit awkward in daily life.

1904
02:46:41.68 --> 02:46:45.20
Being gives them the confidence and feeling of self-worth.

1905
02:46:45.20 --> 02:46:51.56
Sometimes they will add a little alcohol on top of that and Moira wrestled with self-confidence

1906
02:46:51.56 --> 02:46:57.52
and fear performing in alcohol and alcohol helped quiet those feelings.

1907
02:46:57.52 --> 02:47:01.000
One night and again I'm jumping through some type of stuff.

1908
02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.96
I kind of jump over some of that and maybe just a...

1909
02:47:06.96 --> 02:47:16.04
This is kind of a difficult chapter and my ten not to go through it too much, but Cliff's

1910
02:47:16.04 --> 02:47:18.76
notes maybe.

1911
02:47:18.76 --> 02:47:22.56
Yeah.

1912
02:47:22.56 --> 02:47:24.08
It's definitely a tough chapter.

1913
02:47:24.08 --> 02:47:26.12
Yeah, it was a hard one to write.

1914
02:47:26.12 --> 02:47:27.12
That's true.

1915
02:47:27.12 --> 02:47:33.96
Take this chapter in view because it's very personal and difficult story, family story for our family.

1916
02:47:33.96 --> 02:47:38.96
But it's a hopeful story as well and that's why we wanted to include it.

1917
02:47:38.96 --> 02:47:45.52
Yeah, and what I liked about reading it was, look, I hear from people all the time that

1918
02:47:45.52 --> 02:47:53.44
are caught in this trap and this is the story of that this trap doesn't have to keep you

1919
02:47:53.44 --> 02:47:58.20
that you can get out of it.

1920
02:47:58.20 --> 02:47:59.52
And that's what you get into.

1921
02:47:59.52 --> 02:48:04.84
So as time went on going back to the book I began to see that it was a big deal.

1922
02:48:04.84 --> 02:48:08.68
As life and Moira is drinking, I got scarier and scarier at one point about 1995 or so,

1923
02:48:08.68 --> 02:48:10.32
I simply stopped drinking with her.

1924
02:48:10.32 --> 02:48:14.12
I figured if she didn't have me as a drinking buddy anymore, then that would help and

1925
02:48:14.12 --> 02:48:15.92
maybe she would stop.

1926
02:48:15.92 --> 02:48:17.12
But that was wishful thinking.

1927
02:48:17.12 --> 02:48:21.20
Alcohol is consuming Moira by then and sometimes she would drink so much she'd pass

1928
02:48:21.20 --> 02:48:22.20
out as time went on.

1929
02:48:22.20 --> 02:48:26.84
I had to be careful what I said and how I said it because when she drinks you would react

1930
02:48:26.84 --> 02:48:29.08
unpredictably and kind of crazy.

1931
02:48:29.08 --> 02:48:32.28
She started to hide her drinking from me and the family.

1932
02:48:32.28 --> 02:48:36.64
I'd get rid of booze all the booze in the house but I'd find an open cabinet.

1933
02:48:36.64 --> 02:48:40.20
I'd find a top cabinet with a bottle tucked far away in the back.

1934
02:48:40.20 --> 02:48:44.08
I'd sometimes find a bottle hidden in the tank of the toilet.

1935
02:48:44.08 --> 02:48:48.28
At times when I came home she'd a week of perfume and mouthwash and effort to hide her

1936
02:48:48.28 --> 02:48:52.96
drinking from me.

1937
02:48:52.96 --> 02:49:00.28
At this point you had signed on to do a show called George Wallace was that a movie?

1938
02:49:00.28 --> 02:49:08.64
It was a TNT mini-series thing about the governor of Alabama.

1939
02:49:08.64 --> 02:49:13.20
And by this time alcohol had taken control of Moira.

1940
02:49:13.20 --> 02:49:18.24
It was as if she had two personalities when she was drinking, she was a beautiful self

1941
02:49:18.24 --> 02:49:22.96
respectable doctor, Dr. Jekyll but when she drank she turned into an out of control and

1942
02:49:22.96 --> 02:49:24.92
scary Mr. Hyde.

1943
02:49:24.92 --> 02:49:28.08
Sophie was nine years old at the worst of Moira's drinking.

1944
02:49:28.08 --> 02:49:30.28
Mac was six, Ella was five.

1945
02:49:30.28 --> 02:49:34.20
Moira was always a great mom and tried her best but because of her drinking at times I felt

1946
02:49:34.20 --> 02:49:35.68
afraid for our children.

1947
02:49:35.68 --> 02:49:37.76
Each night Moira would drink.

1948
02:49:37.76 --> 02:49:40.64
Then each morning she'd feel guilty and apologized.

1949
02:49:40.64 --> 02:49:44.28
I'd tell her she simply couldn't keep doing this and she'd say yes you're right I'll

1950
02:49:44.28 --> 02:49:45.28
stop.

1951
02:49:45.28 --> 02:49:47.72
But the next night she'd do it again.

1952
02:49:47.72 --> 02:49:48.72
She couldn't help it.

1953
02:49:48.72 --> 02:49:53.72
So many good things were happening with my acting career.

1954
02:49:53.72 --> 02:49:58.52
I'd start rehearsing for George Wallace with John Frick and Hymer and was trying to focus

1955
02:49:58.52 --> 02:50:02.64
on my role but night after night when I came home from rehearsals our home turned into

1956
02:50:02.64 --> 02:50:12.12
a battlefield.

1957
02:50:12.12 --> 02:50:16.16
You say here jumping ahead finally it became clear that Moira had no ability to stop

1958
02:50:16.16 --> 02:50:18.44
or drinking I didn't know where to turn.

1959
02:50:18.44 --> 02:50:23.04
I started going to Alonon family groups for people worried about someone with a drinking

1960
02:50:23.04 --> 02:50:24.04
problem.

1961
02:50:24.04 --> 02:50:27.20
I started seeing a psychologist who specialized in alcoholism and helping families through

1962
02:50:27.20 --> 02:50:28.52
difficult challenges.

1963
02:50:28.52 --> 02:50:31.68
I learned that family members must become tough in their love.

1964
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:35.64
I need to become ruthless in combating this addiction for the sake of my wife but it was

1965
02:50:35.64 --> 02:50:36.88
very hard to do.

1966
02:50:36.88 --> 02:50:41.000
You want to plead and beg and appeal to the wonderful loving person you know is deep down

1967
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.32
inside.

1968
02:50:42.32 --> 02:50:50.08
If that person has been consumed swallowed up and cannot hear you and you kind of get

1969
02:50:50.08 --> 02:50:58.32
to your your wits end about this and you talked to John Frick and Hymer was either director

1970
02:50:58.32 --> 02:51:06.32
of George Wallace and you finally opened up to him and you tell him what's going on and

1971
02:51:06.32 --> 02:51:07.32
back to the book.

1972
02:51:07.32 --> 02:51:13.36
And so for more than 25 years and was a serious attendee of alcoholics anonymous he was a

1973
02:51:13.36 --> 02:51:18.72
hardcore A.A. warrior and told me what I needed to do I needed to take Moira to rehab.

1974
02:51:18.72 --> 02:51:24.92
I needed to do it right away.

1975
02:51:24.92 --> 02:51:31.88
So you you you take her you take her to rehab.

1976
02:51:31.88 --> 02:51:38.88
She's freaks out on the way there you compare her to Linda Blair in the extra sister

1977
02:51:38.88 --> 02:51:44.32
in terms of her behavior on the way there and you're asking yourself like who who is this

1978
02:51:44.32 --> 02:51:52.32
person and what's happening.

1979
02:51:52.32 --> 02:51:57.12
Fast forward a bit here you say an average stay in rehab is 28 days my wife stayed in rehab

1980
02:51:57.12 --> 02:51:58.80
for seven weeks.

1981
02:51:58.80 --> 02:52:01.40
She was there the entire time I was shooting the movie.

1982
02:52:01.40 --> 02:52:05.92
I received a call from a facility at one point and a rehab supervisor indicated they

1983
02:52:05.92 --> 02:52:11.56
were having a hard time getting Moira to admit she had a problem.

1984
02:52:11.56 --> 02:52:17.32
She thought she was fine and then everybody there was messed up that meant trouble.

1985
02:52:17.32 --> 02:52:26.08
If you never admit you have a problem you'll never get better.

1986
02:52:26.08 --> 02:52:31.84
When they were telling you that she didn't she wasn't admitting to her she wasn't owning

1987
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:36.64
the problem that you kind of knew this is not good.

1988
02:52:36.64 --> 02:52:47.000
Yeah yeah that was that was not surprising because I knew she was kind of deep in the

1989
02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:55.44
throws of the devil at his hands around her neck and we had to come up with try to come

1990
02:52:55.44 --> 02:53:03.76
up with some additional ways to get her to admit it and to face it and she wasn't going

1991
02:53:03.76 --> 02:53:09.72
to get better if she didn't realize what her issue was and that it was real.

1992
02:53:09.72 --> 02:53:25.08
So rehab after seven weeks I brought her home and within gosh prompy within four months

1993
02:53:25.08 --> 02:53:32.44
she had fallen again and had to go to rehab again and that's when things began to get

1994
02:53:32.44 --> 02:53:37.48
better and change after the second time.

1995
02:53:37.48 --> 02:53:48.36
Yeah it seemed like that was a point where you described finding out that she's basically

1996
02:53:48.36 --> 02:53:51.20
you're on the road you're doing another thing.

1997
02:53:51.20 --> 02:53:57.64
Snake eyes and you're on the road doing that you get a call from your daughter basically

1998
02:53:57.64 --> 02:54:02.44
saying mom still drinking.

1999
02:54:02.44 --> 02:54:05.48
You say here in the book I wanted to be the loving husband the gentle husband I wanted

2000
02:54:05.48 --> 02:54:11.84
to ask more a nicely please don't drink again but with the vicious enemy of alcohol

2001
02:54:11.84 --> 02:54:16.92
taking over the life of the woman I loved I learned that you could show no mercy fighting

2002
02:54:16.92 --> 02:54:19.56
this enemy.

2003
02:54:19.56 --> 02:54:23.40
I called John Frankenheimer and said more it has relapsed.

2004
02:54:23.40 --> 02:54:26.20
I'm heading back to Los Angeles but I don't know what I'm going to do.

2005
02:54:26.20 --> 02:54:31.28
John said it's time to take the gloves off and he told me exactly what I needed to do.

2006
02:54:31.28 --> 02:54:34.64
When I arrived home the next day more to open the door and I spotted it right away

2007
02:54:34.64 --> 02:54:36.12
she'd been drinking again.

2008
02:54:36.12 --> 02:54:39.40
I came in the house gave the kid her and the kids a hug acted as if everything was

2009
02:54:39.40 --> 02:54:40.88
normal and fine.

2010
02:54:40.88 --> 02:54:44.08
After a short while I said to Moira honey you look tired why don't you go down and

2011
02:54:44.08 --> 02:54:45.52
take a nap.

2012
02:54:45.52 --> 02:54:47.68
She said you know I am kind of tired I think I will.

2013
02:54:47.68 --> 02:54:50.88
She went to lie down in the back bedroom 20 minutes later I checked on her.

2014
02:54:50.88 --> 02:54:53.68
She was out like a light.

2015
02:54:53.68 --> 02:54:58.40
I packed three suitcases called a card a pick us up and wrote Moira the hardest letter

2016
02:54:58.40 --> 02:55:00.32
I've ever had to write.

2017
02:55:00.32 --> 02:55:05.72
I explained we'd reached a point of decision she couldn't have our family and still have

2018
02:55:05.72 --> 02:55:06.96
alcohol.

2019
02:55:06.96 --> 02:55:11.12
She needed to choose between us and she needed to get serious about her choice because

2020
02:55:11.12 --> 02:55:13.000
I was finished.

2021
02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.08
I told her I loved her so much and I wanted her to be okay.

2022
02:55:16.08 --> 02:55:19.76
What I wanted most in life was for her to be sober and happy and for us to be together

2023
02:55:19.76 --> 02:55:21.76
again as a family.

2024
02:55:21.76 --> 02:55:26.20
But we couldn't do that if she continued to drink.

2025
02:55:26.20 --> 02:55:30.24
I was taking the kids.

2026
02:55:30.24 --> 02:55:39.48
And that's you know that's a kind of easy thing to do.

2027
02:55:39.48 --> 02:55:46.56
You always want to you know I remember you know because I started seeing counselors myself

2028
02:55:46.56 --> 02:55:48.48
to help me with this issue.

2029
02:55:48.48 --> 02:55:57.92
I started seeing a counselor who was focused on dealing with alcoholism and problems and

2030
02:55:57.92 --> 02:56:05.44
I started going to Alonon and doing you know where can I turn to get some help here.

2031
02:56:05.44 --> 02:56:12.24
And you know you keep one day you know the next day after a bender the night before

2032
02:56:12.24 --> 02:56:18.84
you see the sweet person she's apologizing and you know you're hugging and everything

2033
02:56:18.84 --> 02:56:25.96
and you just want that person to stay there you know and so you kind of you go okay okay

2034
02:56:25.96 --> 02:56:32.60
you know and you're you believe them when they say they're going to stop or when they

2035
02:56:32.60 --> 02:56:38.000
know they misbehaved you know but then it happens again and then it happens again and

2036
02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:44.72
the same thing over and over and over and at a certain point you do have to get as vicious

2037
02:56:44.72 --> 02:56:53.68
as the as the demon is you know it's like it really is wrestling a demon and so I did

2038
02:56:53.68 --> 02:57:05.16
what we had to do which is something to shock her into reality that there was no continuing

2039
02:57:05.16 --> 02:57:16.08
in this cycle anymore for for us and if she and and it did it she she's a loving wonderful

2040
02:57:16.08 --> 02:57:24.000
person who loves her kids and fighting for her kids knowing I had taken them back to Montreal

2041
02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:30.24
with me and they were going to be with me while I made this movie and you don't have anything

2042
02:57:30.24 --> 02:57:36.24
to worry about now you don't have to take care of the kids they're not there I've got them

2043
02:57:36.24 --> 02:57:45.84
you focus on yourself and this issue and within a couple of days she took herself to

2044
02:57:45.84 --> 02:57:51.52
Betty Ford clinic and checked herself in and that that's the last time she you know right before

2045
02:57:51.52 --> 02:58:01.76
she went in there she had her final drink I had a friend who you know was had a lot of money

2046
02:58:01.76 --> 02:58:12.16
it was very wealthy and lost his son to opioid overdose and you know he was kind of

2047
02:58:12.16 --> 02:58:18.80
talking me through what had happened and one of the things he said to me he said you know I had

2048
02:58:19.84 --> 02:58:27.04
unlimited resources unlimited resources I said him to every different rehab all kinds of different

2049
02:58:27.04 --> 02:58:36.32
you know drugs psychologists therapists unlimited resources to try and get his son off of drugs

2050
02:58:36.32 --> 02:58:47.60
and he said the only thing I do was was tough love is the term that he used which you know

2051
02:58:47.60 --> 02:58:56.64
is what you you did here take the gloves off and I can't imagine how hard that's got to be

2052
02:58:57.20 --> 02:59:02.56
to hold the line in those situations where you know when you're looking at your kid your wife

2053
02:59:02.56 --> 02:59:06.48
you're looking at your kid and you're thinking okay I'm not going to give you any more money

2054
02:59:06.96 --> 02:59:11.04
because that's the other thing like not only was this guy investing sending me to a psychologist

2055
02:59:11.04 --> 02:59:15.12
it was also hey dad can I get a hundred bucks to go out to eat well all that money is going to

2056
02:59:15.12 --> 02:59:21.04
drugs hey dad can I go to see a concert well all that money is going to drugs and oh by the way my

2057
02:59:21.04 --> 02:59:25.20
credit card's missing by the way there's a 80 bucks missing from my wallet so he's enabling this

2058
02:59:25.20 --> 02:59:30.000
behavior the whole time and the only way to stop it is okay you know what you're getting nothing

2059
02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:35.60
from me that means you can't stay in my house you can't get food from me and that's the sort of

2060
02:59:35.60 --> 02:59:40.64
extreme measures when you're fighting against these extreme demons that it's seen then again I'm

2061
02:59:40.64 --> 02:59:45.52
I'm not a professional obviously but it seems like when you're going against something that's

2062
02:59:45.52 --> 02:59:53.76
as powerful as drugs or alcohol you have to you have to take extreme measures you do there's no

2063
02:59:53.76 --> 03:00:00.32
question about it and I you know as I said John Frankenheimer was came into my life at the right time

2064
03:00:01.28 --> 03:00:08.32
because he was a hardcore 25 years sober guy and this is a very very well-known

2065
03:00:08.32 --> 03:00:15.84
Hollywood director he directed the Manchurian candidate seven days in May the French connection to

2066
03:00:15.84 --> 03:00:25.20
Grand Prix Black Sunday all these all these great movies and he's directing me and we became friends

2067
03:00:25.20 --> 03:00:32.48
and he shared his story very personal story that where he basically destroyed his career because

2068
03:00:32.48 --> 03:00:37.84
he wouldn't give up drinking when he finally did that he had to go through a lot of soul searching

2069
03:00:37.84 --> 03:00:45.04
and everything before he found his way back into directing again and now he was sober for 25 years and

2070
03:00:45.04 --> 03:00:52.32
he knew what it took for him because he was stubborn as hell just like my wife and he was not going to

2071
03:00:52.32 --> 03:01:02.80
go quietly and give up the booze until there was some hard decisions and some people took the gloves off with them

2072
03:01:02.80 --> 03:01:17.84
well good news you ended up winning an Emmy for your role in George Wallace did a bunch of other

2073
03:01:17.84 --> 03:01:25.36
movies the championships season the green mile it's the rage Bruno imposter mission of Mars

2074
03:01:25.36 --> 03:01:33.52
reindeer games all still career going you know solid working yeah

2075
03:01:34.88 --> 03:01:45.20
Moira ends up going to a church looking for an AA meeting she passes an elderly French woman

2076
03:01:45.20 --> 03:01:49.92
a member of the parish going back to the book the woman said an thick French accent my dear you

2077
03:01:49.92 --> 03:01:56.48
need to become a Catholic you need to convert and walk away that got Moira to thinking here she was

2078
03:01:56.48 --> 03:02:00.16
playing this Irish woman because she was in a play at the time playing this Irish woman

2079
03:02:00.96 --> 03:02:05.92
searching for strength and a play set in a tavern and in her own life she was searching for strength

2080
03:02:06.32 --> 03:02:11.44
to help with her sobriety nothing was set or done immediately but Moira later told me she

2081
03:02:11.44 --> 03:02:18.48
began to feel a quiet yearning for her own shooting star and that's a reference that you talk about earlier

2082
03:02:18.48 --> 03:02:29.92
about recognizing that there are other forces bigger than ourselves and you you're moving around a bit

2083
03:02:29.92 --> 03:02:34.32
but Moira turned to me quite out of the blue and said oh when we get back home I'm going to

2084
03:02:34.32 --> 03:02:42.40
become a Catholic and our kids are going to go to Catholics that's right fast forward a bit Moira

2085
03:02:42.40 --> 03:02:47.52
was Moira got confirmed Ella started third grade max started fourth and Sophie started sixth

2086
03:02:47.52 --> 03:02:54.96
at the local Catholic school fast forward a bit Moira and Christmas Eve 2010 I told my wife and

2087
03:02:54.96 --> 03:02:59.28
kids to get dressed up we were headed for a special family dinner at Morton's stay cows the place

2088
03:02:59.28 --> 03:03:03.92
we all enjoyed on a way to dinner I suddenly pulled into the church parking lot a mast was underway

2089
03:03:03.92 --> 03:03:08.64
and my family looked confused it was too late to attend mass what we were doing what we were doing there

2090
03:03:08.64 --> 03:03:13.20
without any family members knowing I had been attending private sessions to be officially confirmed

2091
03:03:13.20 --> 03:03:18.24
into the church our priest was expecting us and in a small quiet ceremony on Christmas Eve surrounded

2092
03:03:18.24 --> 03:03:22.88
by the family I love and cherished dearly I was officially confirmed into the Catholic church it was a

2093
03:03:22.88 --> 03:03:29.04
very special night no lives Moira was so touched she'd come a long way our family had come a long

2094
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:36.08
way and I wanted a belong to the faith as Moira did it meant so much to me to her to all of us

2095
03:03:36.88 --> 03:03:42.32
you know I had the obviously this was a difficult story to tell this chapter chapter nine and

2096
03:03:42.32 --> 03:03:50.64
I wanted Moira's full consent you know should I should I tell the story in the book what we went

2097
03:03:50.64 --> 03:03:59.28
through the darkness and light of it and how it it plays into us into our lives and

2098
03:04:00.08 --> 03:04:07.20
she said yes you know maybe someone struggling with this kind of thing will read it and find hope

2099
03:04:07.20 --> 03:04:14.88
you know in it that hey maybe maybe I can overcome this particular demon myself

2100
03:04:16.16 --> 03:04:21.20
you know during this period of time everything on the outside my career

2101
03:04:21.20 --> 03:04:27.60
who did a damn ransom you know all these different things we're having winning awards I played

2102
03:04:27.60 --> 03:04:33.12
Harry Truman I got that golden globe and then the sag awards and the amnes and you know all this

2103
03:04:33.12 --> 03:04:39.84
stuff was happening there was all very positive and wonderful when everything and at home you know

2104
03:04:40.72 --> 03:04:46.16
it was dark it was tough it was difficult we were struggling and the family was really going through

2105
03:04:46.16 --> 03:04:53.12
some difficult things so nobody ever knew that we decided to tell that story because at a time

2106
03:04:53.12 --> 03:04:58.72
where it looked like Gary Sunise was on the rise and all the all everything was rosy and everything

2107
03:04:58.72 --> 03:05:06.32
we were struggling with some very serious issues at home but we came through it and some very

2108
03:05:06.32 --> 03:05:14.40
very positive things happened because of it so you never know you know a difficult difficult

2109
03:05:14.40 --> 03:05:21.04
difficult period in your life can manifest itself into something that you never could have

2110
03:05:21.04 --> 03:05:28.32
predicted would would be positive you know had had had another time you know I mean you can't you know you

2111
03:05:28.32 --> 03:05:35.52
wait you know years from now you know I know you're going through this right now but it's down the road

2112
03:05:35.52 --> 03:05:41.76
everything's going to be better and when you're going through that you can't see that you know you just

2113
03:05:41.76 --> 03:05:47.76
can't see so many might tell you that but you you can't see it I couldn't picture getting out of this

2114
03:05:47.76 --> 03:05:57.44
and how it was got I didn't want my relationship to be destroyed because of alcohol or my wife to

2115
03:05:57.44 --> 03:06:07.44
go down that road I was so so blessed that she kind of it it worked taking the kids and go on

2116
03:06:07.44 --> 03:06:18.88
leaving her by herself to confront this demon did did the trick and she's been sober 22 years now

2117
03:06:20.56 --> 03:06:26.48
yeah well I'm like I said as we started that chapter you know you said maybe someone will hear this

2118
03:06:26.48 --> 03:06:33.52
and it'll help them I there's no maybe on that I promise you that people will hear that and and they will

2119
03:06:33.52 --> 03:06:41.84
it will shed some light into their lives and help them get through to fight this this powerful

2120
03:06:41.84 --> 03:06:49.20
powerful demon I guarantee it all right I hope so I mean that that's the purpose that we decided to

2121
03:06:49.20 --> 03:07:00.40
share it in the book you know it's it's it's played a role in the in my service life because you know

2122
03:07:00.40 --> 03:07:09.76
becoming a you know remember the Catholic Church and and the service aspect of the faith and and what

2123
03:07:09.76 --> 03:07:21.20
not there was definitely a role that that that faith played in my turning from self to service there's

2124
03:07:21.20 --> 03:07:31.20
no question about speaking of turning from self to service jumping ahead here a bit one morning

2125
03:07:31.20 --> 03:07:36.88
September about 630 more as more to help the kids get ready for school our phone rang I was still

2126
03:07:36.88 --> 03:07:41.76
sleeping Terry Kenny who lived in New York was on the line simultaneously more to turn on the TV

2127
03:07:42.32 --> 03:07:47.20
Hi Terry I said Gary are you watching TV right now I just got up buddy what's going on

2128
03:07:48.08 --> 03:07:52.000
two planes have hit the world trade center the tops of both buildings are on fire

2129
03:07:54.08 --> 03:07:59.20
Terry's words spilled out we're under attack Gary Terry's have classed airplanes into those buildings

2130
03:07:59.20 --> 03:08:04.56
it's bad really bad every American alive and then remembers that moment and can answer

2131
03:08:04.56 --> 03:08:08.72
the inevitable question to where were you when you first heard the news I stared in shock and

2132
03:08:08.72 --> 03:08:13.68
disbelief along with the entire country the entire world has smoked port from the tops of both buildings

2133
03:08:14.24 --> 03:08:19.36
horrified we watched on live TV as people left to their deaths from the upper floors of the trade

2134
03:08:19.36 --> 03:08:24.96
center as soon as the reports soon arrived at a third airplane a crash to the Pentagon

2135
03:08:24.96 --> 03:08:28.96
about 20 minutes later a fourth airplane crashed near Shanksville Pennsylvania

2136
03:08:28.96 --> 03:08:35.52
we heard it was united flight 93 seemingly bound for the White House the target was ultimately

2137
03:08:35.52 --> 03:08:41.52
determined by the 9-11 Commission report to be the capital building people on board flight 93

2138
03:08:41.52 --> 03:08:44.96
had discovered that terrorist were crashing planes into buildings in the passenger to courageously

2139
03:08:44.96 --> 03:08:49.92
yet faithfully chosen to take back the plane we watched the South Tower collapse and crumble

2140
03:08:49.92 --> 03:09:01.52
in a fury of dust and smoke then the north tower fell horror enveloped us all you say while driving

2141
03:09:01.52 --> 03:09:05.76
through one of the canyons and this is on September 11th I clicked on the radio news news

2142
03:09:05.76 --> 03:09:10.16
castors speculated that today's attacks were only the beginning of more attacks to come the reality

2143
03:09:10.16 --> 03:09:14.40
of the morning sank and even deeper our country was under attack vulnerable thousands of

2144
03:09:14.40 --> 03:09:19.36
innocent people have been killed that day more horror lay ahead I couldn't tell you exactly why

2145
03:09:19.36 --> 03:09:24.80
did this perhaps in solidarity defiance tribute but I rolled down my window stuck out my arm

2146
03:09:24.80 --> 03:09:29.60
and made a fist and held it high here's well-duped my eyes as I listened to the news

2147
03:09:30.64 --> 03:09:36.32
for some time as I wrote along I held my arm out stretched as high as it would reach

2148
03:09:36.32 --> 03:09:54.72
you're living in California at the time in LA Malibu in Malibu and even in Malibu they broke out

2149
03:09:54.72 --> 03:10:04.40
the American flags yeah yeah on Friday night so it was a Tuesday and they were candlelight

2150
03:10:04.40 --> 03:10:12.88
vigils all over the place if you remember and we heard about something going on on one of the

2151
03:10:12.88 --> 03:10:22.80
corners in our neighborhood so I grabbed I grabbed an American flag that I had hanging by my front door

2152
03:10:23.76 --> 03:10:29.44
and we walked down the street with the kids and we went and all the neighbors were gathering around

2153
03:10:29.44 --> 03:10:37.36
and people were singing and at one point everybody I had my flag up and at one point everyone

2154
03:10:37.36 --> 03:10:43.04
turned and said the pledge of allegiance and it was God bless America and it was America the

2155
03:10:43.04 --> 03:10:49.04
beautiful and it was the stars you know the national anthem and and people were just singing

2156
03:10:49.04 --> 03:10:55.28
with candles on the corner in Malibu just coming together people were in pain all over the

2157
03:10:55.28 --> 03:11:01.28
place and everyone was looking for something and during the day that day we went to our little

2158
03:11:01.28 --> 03:11:06.88
Catholic church I don't know if you remember but George Bush said he was going to make

2159
03:11:07.76 --> 03:11:16.08
that Friday a national day of prayer for the nation and so the churches and houses of worship

2160
03:11:16.08 --> 03:11:24.32
everywhere in the country were just jam packed with people trying to find some peace some

2161
03:11:24.32 --> 03:11:30.24
like trying to understand what was going on and trying to find something and we got to our

2162
03:11:30.24 --> 03:11:36.88
little Catholic church at the school that my kids went to and there was only standing room

2163
03:11:38.24 --> 03:11:47.20
it was packed and we ended up standing off to the side leaning against the wall and I remember the

2164
03:11:47.20 --> 03:11:52.24
priest he and his first thing he said I don't remember everything he said but he said this is

2165
03:11:52.24 --> 03:12:00.80
been a tough week and everybody was just you know and at the end of the the mass and

2166
03:12:03.20 --> 03:12:09.04
we sang God bless America and the church and I couldn't even get the words out I mean it's just

2167
03:12:09.04 --> 03:12:14.56
tears rollin down my face everything changed for me at that point the chapter in the book that

2168
03:12:14.56 --> 03:12:21.36
kind of explores that is called turning point and it was you know the the things we talked about in

2169
03:12:21.36 --> 03:12:26.08
the 80s with regards to the Vietnam veterans and my family and tracers and all these Vietnam

2170
03:12:26.08 --> 03:12:31.76
veterans things and Lieutenant Dan comes along and I I start working with our wounded after that

2171
03:12:31.76 --> 03:12:36.96
with the disabled American veterans organization they contacted me and asked me to come to

2172
03:12:36.96 --> 03:12:42.32
their national convention they gave him a word for playing Lieutenant Dan and there was a sea of

2173
03:12:42.32 --> 03:12:48.64
wheelchairs and wounded veterans from going back to World War II and they were all applauding me

2174
03:12:48.64 --> 03:12:54.40
and everything I was very moved by that state involved with them tried to support the DAV for

2175
03:12:54.40 --> 03:12:59.36
a number of years and then along comes September 11th and the seeds that have been planted in those

2176
03:13:00.56 --> 03:13:06.96
80s years with the veterans and my family Vietnam veterans and then working in support of the

2177
03:13:06.96 --> 03:13:16.48
DAV some that all kind of grew into this thing after September 11th and I turned never

2178
03:13:16.48 --> 03:13:28.72
to return to business as usual I turned towards service in a very not a very active way and it just

2179
03:13:28.72 --> 03:13:35.12
got more and more and more and I I wanted to help our veterans the men and women who were responding

2180
03:13:35.12 --> 03:13:40.96
to those attacks and deploying to Afghanistan or Iraq and elsewhere and I wanted to support them

2181
03:13:40.96 --> 03:13:49.52
one of the things that you say here around that is throughout my entire life I'd always been

2182
03:13:49.52 --> 03:13:55.28
the type of person who chose to act on the theater sense of the way word although I did a lot of

2183
03:13:55.28 --> 03:14:00.72
that but I mean take action whether we're starting a band that lip synced for a living room

2184
03:14:00.72 --> 03:14:04.56
full neighborhood kids or working with my fellow high school students to fashion our own theater

2185
03:14:04.56 --> 03:14:08.64
company or taking a great production to New York or moving out to Los Angeles so I could work in

2186
03:14:08.64 --> 03:14:13.12
the movies I'd never been the kind of guy who sat around and talked or wondered or thought about

2187
03:14:13.12 --> 03:14:17.28
stuff without doing something about it at least not for long my response had always been to take

2188
03:14:17.28 --> 03:14:22.96
action and hopefully doing so would benefit other people along the way in those early months of

2189
03:14:22.96 --> 03:14:29.92
2003 and again I jumped ahead to get here I realized I'd never before the cost of freedom and I

2190
03:14:29.92 --> 03:14:34.48
knew freedom needed to be defended I knew places that existed in our world without freedom

2191
03:14:34.48 --> 03:14:39.36
and I knew that without freedom nothing of the good and fulfilling ways we in America aspire

2192
03:14:39.36 --> 03:14:44.96
to live our lives would be possible this realization helped fuel me more than ever before it

2193
03:14:44.96 --> 03:14:49.68
made me profoundly grateful for being an American able to live in this land of freedom able to

2194
03:14:49.68 --> 03:14:54.40
make something of my life when it came to service I wanted to be all in all the time living

2195
03:14:54.40 --> 03:15:00.40
out my calling every single day for the rest of my life I can almost I can say most certainly

2196
03:15:00.40 --> 03:15:05.04
that what happened to our country on September 11th broke my heart and changed me forever

2197
03:15:05.04 --> 03:15:10.88
it forced me to rethink everything what do I really believe how do I want to raise my kids what kind

2198
03:15:10.88 --> 03:15:17.28
of example do I want to set for them what can I do to give this great country what can I do to give

2199
03:15:17.28 --> 03:15:23.68
back to this great country I love how can I use my good fortune to help it was a turning point

2200
03:15:23.68 --> 03:15:30.24
and mark the beginning of a new level of service I found that the more I gave the more I heal

2201
03:15:30.24 --> 03:15:36.96
cold two months after watching the statues of Saddam Hussein being pulled down I was on a plane

2202
03:15:36.96 --> 03:15:45.36
to Kuwait nothing would ever be the same you we kind of kicked off you know the name of this

2203
03:15:45.36 --> 03:15:51.68
next chapter is but a bridge between worlds you know and and bridging this thing and you got

03:15:51.68 --> 03:15:57.60
this here hi I'm Gary Sinis and I'd like to go on a USO tour please call me back I left my number

2205
03:15:57.60 --> 03:16:02.32

2206
03:16:02.32 --> 03:16:06.96
a large bond that calls with similar requests as mine so I called to get an left to second message

2214
03:16:52.24 --> 03:17:00.32
um you end up at one of these bases USO representative motion for us to follow him and let us to the

2215
03:17:00.32 --> 03:17:04.48
big tent near the center of camp the tent had an entrance on each side generators working over time

2216
03:17:04.48 --> 03:17:08.64
to pump an air conditioning we headed for one door and at the other side a line of at least

2217
03:17:08.64 --> 03:17:13.60
a thousand troops waited in the heat to get in as we headed in they started to applaud the

2218
03:17:13.60 --> 03:17:18.96
atmosphere inside crackled maybe another thousand uniform troops already inside the tent broken

2219
03:17:18.96 --> 03:17:24.000
to applause when we came into the tent I took a deep breath what have we done they deserve the

2220
03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:28.96
applause not us but wow this is amazing even with a little air even with a little air conditioning

2221
03:17:28.96 --> 03:17:32.72
it was hot as hell in there nobody seemed to care we lined up and the troops lined up and

2222
03:17:32.72 --> 03:17:37.52
started to file past us we smiled and shook hands and posed for pictures and everything happened

2223
03:17:37.52 --> 03:17:42.000
quite quickly the very first soldier I met said hey Lieutenant Dan you got legs

2224
03:17:44.40 --> 03:17:47.36
and then each one down the line just kept calling me Lieutenant Dan over and over

2225
03:17:47.36 --> 03:17:52.40
I realized they didn't know my real name so I went with it I tried to look each person the

2226
03:17:52.40 --> 03:17:55.92
I tried to ask each soldier where he or she was from tried to ask how things were going

2227
03:17:56.80 --> 03:18:00.96
but nothing I did felt very deep because we had to keep the line moving there are so many people

2228
03:18:00.96 --> 03:18:05.52
and then you guys have to leave and you kind of you kind of ask yourself that we do any good

2229
03:18:08.40 --> 03:18:10.72
now you're traveling around you're getting ready for a next

2230
03:18:10.72 --> 03:18:17.04
um a next trip I think you're heading into Baghdad you say this the man to the right

2231
03:18:17.04 --> 03:18:21.28
of me wore a button on his shirt bearing the photo of two young men a New York City police officer

2232
03:18:21.28 --> 03:18:28.24
and the other a firefighter with the FD NY we struck up a struck up quite a conversation and I learned

2233
03:18:28.80 --> 03:18:33.92
he wasn't an entertainer the two young men were his sons and both sons a died on 911

2234
03:18:34.72 --> 03:18:39.20
he was there because he wanted the troops overseas to knew no that America supported them

2235
03:18:39.20 --> 03:18:44.88
the man was maybe in his mid sixties and spoke with a low rasp scars ran across his neck

2236
03:18:44.88 --> 03:18:50.48
and later I found out he'd survive throat cancer the man carried a chunk of rock concrete made

2237
03:18:50.48 --> 03:18:55.04
maybe he showed it to me then passed in my direction so I could feel it too I ran my hands over

2238
03:18:55.04 --> 03:19:00.88
its rough surface it felt like an old piece of rubble puzzle asked him what it was all about

2239
03:19:00.88 --> 03:19:07.04
why he was carrying all this extra weight he swallowed once twice then his eyes grew wet

2240
03:19:07.04 --> 03:19:13.76
he whispered more horsely than before it's a piece of the world trade center

2241
03:19:20.72 --> 03:19:27.44
you guys land at the uh saddam international airport well what was formally the saddam international

2242
03:19:27.44 --> 03:19:32.80
airport which by this time was called the Baghdad International Airport and by the way I wanted to mention

2243
03:19:32.80 --> 03:19:39.20
this it was still a little soft I was going to tell you that you beat me to Iraq

2244
03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:46.48
because you went to Iraq for the first time in June of 2003 I didn't get to Iraq until

2245
03:19:47.68 --> 03:19:55.44
I think it was late September early October 2003 so I was on point yeah I was a new guy

2246
03:19:55.44 --> 03:20:03.84
setting the stage always it's Sherry boy yeah but I got to leave after five days yeah that's a

2247
03:20:03.84 --> 03:20:08.40
little bit different yeah yeah that's but that's impressive that you got in there that quick

2248
03:20:08.40 --> 03:20:16.48
I would have really liked to have joined you now you're landing there when we clattered down the

2249
03:20:16.48 --> 03:20:23.20
car goes uh planes the planes ramp I can only shake my head and dip disbelief in front of us waiting

2250
03:20:23.20 --> 03:20:28.000
in two long rows of uniforms stood American soldiers thousand strong lining our route all the

2251
03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:32.40
way to the cargo from the cargo plane to the hangar like a happy government we simply walk forward

2252
03:20:32.40 --> 03:20:37.28
and show cans on a way to the destination soldier after soldier marine after marine say what

2253
03:20:37.28 --> 03:20:42.56

03:20:42.56 --> 03:20:47.60
they're honored grateful so incredibly grateful we were here for them but they had our backs

2255
03:20:48.24 --> 03:20:51.60
they weren't gonna let anything happen to us they were here for us

2256
03:20:51.60 --> 03:21:02.000

03:22:32.56 --> 03:22:40.64
airport thousands of people it was pretty pretty amazing just to be there with so many soldiers

2271
03:22:40.64 --> 03:22:47.60
we entertained them there in the hanger maybe 4,000 people in the hanger you know I got to see

2272
03:22:47.60 --> 03:22:55.36
the palaces I got to meet a lot a lot of troops during this this trip it was it was an amazing trip

2273
03:22:55.36 --> 03:23:01.20
and I kind of befriended Tommy Franks from that moment on we ended up going to do a

2274
03:23:01.20 --> 03:23:07.76
long after that to the central command and we did some shows there and met a lot of people and

2275
03:23:09.04 --> 03:23:13.04
it was amazing I was back in Iraq within six months again for another trip

2276
03:23:14.96 --> 03:23:20.48
I'll say this too and when you like I said so all that took place I wouldn't even go into Iraq

2277
03:23:21.20 --> 03:23:27.76
I was awaiting to go to Iraq when did you go out of the fall of 2003 so I was I was back in November

2278
03:23:27.76 --> 03:23:40.80
back in November but I'll say this at this time that early like the war had a different feel to it

2279
03:23:40.80 --> 03:23:50.40
no question we were kind of just winning you know hey look we're taking some casualties for sure

2280
03:23:50.40 --> 03:23:56.96
but there was there was no insurgency yet there was some former regime elements were running around

2281
03:23:56.96 --> 03:24:03.52
we had the deck of cards we were going after we were doing pretty good we were we didn't get

2282
03:24:03.52 --> 03:24:10.000
some sedum until later that later that year but I was there when we got sedum not we me but

2283
03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:23.92
American forces got sedum but but still it was the it was still seemed like everything was going pretty

2284
03:24:23.92 --> 03:24:28.96
good I mean there's no other way to put it but when I deployed there in 2003 2004

2285
03:24:29.68 --> 03:24:34.80
it if you would have asked me at the end of my deployment how much longer the war in Iraq was

2286
03:24:34.80 --> 03:24:39.20
going to last I would have said oh probably another three four months you know there'll be less

2287
03:24:39.20 --> 03:24:45.04
less combat operations and then you know it'll be you know I'm sure we'll still have some troops there

2288
03:24:45.04 --> 03:24:52.08
but it'll be pretty settled down so you know I was wrong and we were wrong as a country because

2289
03:24:52.08 --> 03:24:59.20
it was it wasn't even getting started yet and so that's why when I picture all these celebrities

2290
03:24:59.20 --> 03:25:06.88
rolling in there you know thinking back to the glory days of Bob Hope like oh yeah this is kind

2291
03:25:06.88 --> 03:25:11.20
of hey that's what that's what I've said this before that's what us young guys that hadn't been

2292
03:25:11.20 --> 03:25:16.80
a combat before we were like we want to go we want to make sure we do you know we want to do our part

2293
03:25:16.80 --> 03:25:22.88
and I could see you know everyone thinking we want to do our part we want to help out and it seemed

2294
03:25:22.88 --> 03:25:26.48
like for lack of a better word it seemed like things were going really well and this wasn't going

2295
03:25:26.48 --> 03:25:30.96
to last too long and we'd all come home and have a big victory parade and be done

2296
03:25:33.20 --> 03:25:40.08
well it would be it would be four years before I went back so during those intervening four

2297
03:25:40.08 --> 03:25:45.60
years oh yeah things got really bad so what did you go back what what was seven oh yeah yeah

2298
03:25:45.60 --> 03:25:50.80
and it was calming down a little bit yeah we were up in the remoddy and you know the surge and

2299
03:25:50.80 --> 03:25:58.08
happened and all of that yeah the time period in between you know well oh five oh six was was

2300
03:25:58.88 --> 03:26:08.16
not good and and I went back again in in a way and I went back a couple years ago

2301
03:26:08.16 --> 03:26:17.76
what year did you go back most recently this 2017 okay well you got more trips to Iraq than I do

2302
03:26:17.76 --> 03:26:28.56
what's up with that you know they're shorter they're much shorter jump it back to the book here

2303
03:26:28.56 --> 03:26:33.92
on September 11th 2003 two years after the attacks on our country I walked into Walter Reed Army

2304
03:26:33.92 --> 03:26:38.96
medical center and national naval medical center but thesa for the first time meeting wounded troops

2305
03:26:38.96 --> 03:26:45.36
in both hospitals in one day Walter Reed at Walter Reed I met a soldier wheeling himself down

2306
03:26:45.36 --> 03:26:50.000
the hallway who went in two weeks earlier at long stool back in Germany he was fresh off the line

2307
03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:55.76
unable to get out of bed now back in Washington DC he was able to get around in a wheelchair it was good to

2308
03:26:55.76 --> 03:27:07.20
see progress and then you say you know you you did six trips and six months I mean going and you

2309
03:27:07.20 --> 03:27:15.68
know your family sticking by you um yeah two of those trips were uh Iraq June and November and

2310
03:27:15.68 --> 03:27:21.12
then in between I went to Germany and I went to Italy and you know they were all troop trips I'd

2311
03:27:21.12 --> 03:27:26.56
come home and say send me send me someplace else and I didn't have a job at the time so I

2312
03:27:27.60 --> 03:27:34.96
had a lot of time and I said you know let's make use of it right now uh then you start talking

2313
03:27:34.96 --> 03:27:42.24
about the hospitals more then here you go into long stool in Germany always quite a first somber

2314
03:27:42.24 --> 03:27:46.32
like it's Melby and Deceptic feel the harshness of the fluorescent lights a lot of these soldiers had

2315
03:27:46.32 --> 03:27:51.60
thousand yard stairs I wore a USO baseball cap and just stood there at first not knowing how to get

2316
03:27:51.60 --> 03:27:56.80
started the silence felt uneasy awkward but I knew I needed to dive in I needed to go to someone

2317
03:27:56.80 --> 03:28:02.16
to introduce myself and just say hello just then one of the soldiers one of the wounded soldiers looked

2318
03:28:02.16 --> 03:28:08.72
up he looked straight into my face and broke out in a big grin and exclaimed lieutenant dance

2319
03:28:10.08 --> 03:28:14.16
a damn broke all the other guys looked at me and rouse themselves the ones who could walk

2320
03:28:14.16 --> 03:28:19.04
crowd around me in the whole mood in the room changed soldier after soldier introduced himself they

2321
03:28:19.04 --> 03:28:23.36
asked me questions about force company told them some funny stories a USO rep had a polaroid

2322
03:28:23.36 --> 03:28:27.04
camera and started taking pictures of me with the guys so I signed the backs of the polaroids

2323
03:28:27.04 --> 03:28:32.08
and handed them out maybe half hour pass not long but when I left that room I couldn't help

2324
03:28:32.08 --> 03:28:40.000
but noticed how the mood felt different now there was laughter joy I knew and I knew I had changed

2325
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:46.40
a change occurred in me too this first room full of banged up service members had forced me to get

2326
03:28:46.40 --> 03:28:55.04
outside of myself they helped me focused on who I was truly therefore them not me it was a reminder

2327
03:28:55.04 --> 03:28:59.92
that this trip was about lifting them up and not about my own fears so I walked into the next

2328
03:28:59.92 --> 03:29:07.52
word word I told myself to stop thinking about how I felt and focused instead on how the troops felt

2329
03:29:07.52 --> 03:29:13.28
my job was to help relieve their pain to give them something else to think about to help them heal

2330
03:29:13.84 --> 03:29:24.96
to spread a bit at you and you know that became you know like you said part of your mission

2331
03:29:24.96 --> 03:29:30.80
and and what you were doing was trying to try to help these guys give something else think about

2332
03:29:30.80 --> 03:29:38.48
yeah and and lift spirits you know that's that's the more point of you know why am I going just

2333
03:29:38.48 --> 03:29:44.24
to see stuff for to do something yeah and I love your perspective and actually like the closing of

2334
03:29:44.24 --> 03:29:49.44
this book leadership strategy and tactics the basically the close the closing chapter

2335
03:29:50.48 --> 03:29:57.84
is called it's it's all on you but not about you right like you're responsible but it's not

2336
03:29:57.84 --> 03:30:03.92
about you leadership isn't about you and that's this this mental note that you make of hey look

2337
03:30:03.92 --> 03:30:08.40
it's hard to go into these rooms but it's not about me it's about making these guys feel better

2338
03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:14.88
I learned I learned a lot on those first trips the landstool was the first military hospital

2339
03:30:14.88 --> 03:30:21.76
that I went to their fresh off the battlefield as you know you know and the the guys that I just

2340
03:30:21.76 --> 03:30:28.56
literally hours I mean the hours off the battlefield and as soon as I got there the bus pulled up

2341
03:30:29.20 --> 03:30:36.72
we we were just about ready to get out of the bus and a fresh batch of wounded were were

2342
03:30:37.60 --> 03:30:43.84
they were just pulling a bus up the airplane had just gotten in they put them on the bus they brought

2343
03:30:43.84 --> 03:30:48.64
them to the hospital entrance so we were going in and they were all of a sudden all these

2344
03:30:48.64 --> 03:30:54.72
all these technicians and everybody started running out of the hospital and started unloading

2345
03:30:54.72 --> 03:31:01.68
this bus which was just nothing but gurneys with wires and you know wounded wounded folks on these

2346
03:31:01.68 --> 03:31:07.28
gurneys and I just sat there and watched them unload the bus of gurneys and then I had

2347
03:31:07.28 --> 03:31:12.56
they go in and I was apprehensive about it tell you the truth I didn't know how he's going to react

2348
03:31:12.56 --> 03:31:19.28
to see and somebody with their legs gone or any of that kind of thing so but I learned a lot on that

2349
03:31:19.28 --> 03:31:23.84
first trip and within two weeks I was at Bethesda and Walter Reed now he's doing that

2350
03:31:28.96 --> 03:31:38.80
at one point you see kid rock doing what kid rock does which is delivering the justice of rock

2351
03:31:38.80 --> 03:31:55.20
at all and I was watching MTV with my wife and on MTV this was 2019 or 1998 or 1999 or 2000

2352
03:31:55.20 --> 03:32:00.40
I don't know what I was in Virginia Beach and kid rock this person no one had ever heard of was playing

2353
03:32:00.40 --> 03:32:12.32
the spring break special at on MTV and he played ball with a ball whatever that song is he played

2354
03:32:12.32 --> 03:32:18.48
that song and I looked at my wife and I said this guy is going to be huge and sure enough kid rock

2355
03:32:18.48 --> 03:32:26.40
I called it I called it yes I don't know if you had I don't know if you had that little dude

2356
03:32:26.40 --> 03:32:33.12
with them or not I remember that the first time I saw my said this is unusual but I'll tell you

2357
03:32:33.12 --> 03:32:39.20
like no kidding when I saw him for the first time I was like this this guy is this guy rocks

2358
03:32:40.24 --> 03:32:49.60
I called it at control so you see that and of course you know despite you doing this acting

2359
03:32:49.60 --> 03:32:57.36
and directing whatever what's your true what your true desires to be a rock and roll star so you

2360
03:32:57.36 --> 03:33:02.16
say to the USO people hey I'd like to you know I put I got a band because you done that you

2361
03:33:02.16 --> 03:33:07.12
done a little gig with your friends and so now you say hey I'd like to go on tour as well

2362
03:33:07.12 --> 03:33:12.96
and they kind of shine you on yeah a little bit I'm an actor with a band is not an interesting

2363
03:33:12.96 --> 03:33:24.72
but you drive on and you put together the the Lieutenant Dan band and your first show is

2364
03:33:24.72 --> 03:33:30.64
at Diego Garcia which only someone in the military could laugh at because Diego Garcia is an island

2365
03:33:30.64 --> 03:33:35.68
in the middle of the Pacific it's as far away as you can move remote place in the world they're like

2366
03:33:35.68 --> 03:33:41.20
oh you want to go into a cool start with Diego Garcia well here's here's the thing about that

2367
03:33:41.20 --> 03:33:48.48
Jacob they you know I bugged them over and over I went on six tours that year and every time I'd

2368
03:33:48.48 --> 03:33:53.28
go on a tour I would bug them you know I got musicians I played with I want to entertain the

2369
03:33:53.28 --> 03:33:58.72
troops I know I'm just shaking hands and taking pictures finally after six tours they knew I was

2370
03:33:58.72 --> 03:34:04.24
serious and they said okay we'll set up a tour for you they didn't ask me for a CD

2371
03:34:04.24 --> 03:34:12.08
to even hear if the band was any good so what they did was just send us as far away as possible

2372
03:34:12.08 --> 03:34:20.72
yes they did and nobody would ever hear about it I guess and you end up playing 30, 40, 50

2373
03:34:20.72 --> 03:34:28.88
shows here we've the first stuff we did was in O3 the first place we played was a great

2374
03:34:28.88 --> 03:34:36.40
lace naval base which was right near where I grew up and we played there in November of O3

2375
03:34:36.40 --> 03:34:43.36
right before my second tour to Iraq handshake tour and then they set up the tour to Korea

2376
03:34:43.36 --> 03:34:52.16
Diego Garcia Singapore in February of O4 and I haven't stopped since now my foundation produces

2377
03:34:52.16 --> 03:35:00.96
most of our shows I do only a few with the USO each year but I think from 2003 to now we're almost

2378
03:35:02.24 --> 03:35:12.32
near nearing 500 shows for the military in that 16 year period impressive and that's the only

2379
03:35:12.32 --> 03:35:17.52
reason I have the band I don't I don't play for money I play for free I have to pay the band

2380
03:35:17.52 --> 03:35:24.48
and everything but I play for free I make my living as an actor so this the band is a part of my

2381
03:35:24.48 --> 03:35:31.44
foundation and people donate to the USO you know they're gonna send entertainment you donate to the

2382
03:35:31.44 --> 03:35:37.28
Gary Sinese Foundation and one of the things that we do is we provide this this entertainment piece

2383
03:35:37.28 --> 03:35:43.68
and I've played on bases all over the world with this band and now we continue to do a couple of days

2384
03:35:43.68 --> 03:35:49.12
we're at naval medical center doing one of our festivals so we continue to get out there and get at it

2385
03:35:51.52 --> 03:36:00.16
another thing you do is you pick up the lead role in CSI New York that's a huge deal that happens

2386
03:36:04.24 --> 03:36:09.92
kind of this is another little layer if you will as you're as you're figuring out the character

2387
03:36:09.92 --> 03:36:18.80
um you want them to be a vet the character's original name was Rick Carlucci and you didn't write

2388
03:36:18.80 --> 03:36:25.20
you really like that you were with Anthony who's Anthony the writer Anthony's writer created CSI

2389
03:36:25.20 --> 03:36:30.96
got it and so you say hey can we change the name Anthony asked me for ideas for a new name I gave

2390
03:36:30.96 --> 03:36:36.96
Melissa suggestions for both the first and last name the name I like most was Mac for obvious reasons

2391
03:36:36.96 --> 03:36:42.16
for the last name I suggested the surname of Lieutenant Dan Anthony wrestled around with his

2392
03:36:42.16 --> 03:36:46.88
suggestions along with some others before coming to me and saying let's do it right away I felt

2393
03:36:46.88 --> 03:36:59.76
gun-ho from my characters new name Mac Taylor yeah that's uh good layer we'll say

2394
03:36:59.76 --> 03:37:09.20
and then just about the about the CSI New York from 2004 until 2013 nine seasons a hundred and

2395
03:37:09.20 --> 03:37:16.48
97 original episodes I portrayed um detective Mac Taylor on CSI New York the show ranked as

2396
03:37:16.48 --> 03:37:22.000
high as number 17 on Neilson and evened out to about 10 million viewers per episode considered

2397
03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:25.60
quite good today it's been shown in more than 200 markets all over the world it continues to run

2398
03:37:25.60 --> 03:37:31.28
in syndication eventually comic books novels a video game and even a slot machine in Vegas came out

2399
03:37:31.28 --> 03:37:36.000
based on the show although at first I didn't didn't see what a blessing it would be the series

2400
03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.40
became one of the greatest gifts ever handed to me nine seasons on television is this tremendous

2401
03:37:40.40 --> 03:37:45.04
success it gave me resources I could never have imagined it allowed me the financial and logistical

2402
03:37:45.04 --> 03:37:49.28
freedom to take good care of my family and continue my mission of supporting the troops

2403
03:37:49.28 --> 03:37:55.44
I will always be proud to have portrayed US Marine Corps veteran at 9-11 family member

2404
03:37:55.44 --> 03:38:03.44
detective Mac Taylor on CSI New York does that what's the role that you get recognized for the

2405
03:38:03.44 --> 03:38:12.08
most still lieutenant damn um could could be yeah but uh CSI New York when you're on television

2406
03:38:12.08 --> 03:38:18.24
every week you know five minutes for a decade yeah you know it it changed and then I did another

2407
03:38:18.24 --> 03:38:24.88
series criminal minds beyond borders for a couple of seasons after that so you know primarily

2408
03:38:24.88 --> 03:38:32.80
uh I think it's it's probably between Mac Taylor and and lieutenant Dan but you know and when

2409
03:38:32.80 --> 03:38:39.12
I'm when I'm went overseas you know one time I'm up on the DMZ and Korea right and I'm doing a tour

2410
03:38:39.12 --> 03:38:46.16
with the band over in Korea we we go up to the DMZ to look around and get a tour up there and I'm in

2411
03:38:46.16 --> 03:38:52.72
the gift shop there's a gift shop on the DMZ you know you gotta go buy some DMZ stuff and a group

2412
03:38:52.72 --> 03:38:58.000
of Asian tourists but tour bus pulled up the Asian tourists come out they come into the

2413
03:38:58.72 --> 03:39:04.80
into the uh into the gift shop and there's 50 it's packed in there with the tourists and they're

2414
03:39:04.80 --> 03:39:11.36
looking at stuff and so all of a sudden one sees me and you will muck Taylor and all of a sudden

2415
03:39:11.36 --> 03:39:18.72
the whole place goes nuts and here I am on the DMZ in a gift shop with all the tourists

2416
03:39:18.72 --> 03:39:25.84
screaming about CSI New York it was completely surreal but it was it's because it internationally

2417
03:39:25.84 --> 03:39:33.28
it was it was very popular in certain places it was very popular in South Korea that's crazy

2418
03:39:33.28 --> 03:39:43.20
uh next section that you talk about is um you're back in Iraq we screwed up in helmets and both

2419
03:39:43.20 --> 03:39:48.32
prove vests and drove out uh in a convoy of homies to visit one of the Iraqi elementary schools

2420
03:39:48.32 --> 03:39:52.40
that U.S. troops had been working to improve who's November 2003 my second tour of Iraq

2421
03:39:53.36 --> 03:39:57.60
with the U.S.L. the school itself wasn't considered dangerous but the roads to the school and back

2422
03:39:57.60 --> 03:40:03.60
were always suspect particularly when traveling with U.S. military so you roll into this school I

2423
03:40:03.60 --> 03:40:08.40
couldn't help but notice how many children sat at each desk the desks look longer than typical

2424
03:40:08.40 --> 03:40:13.52
American school desks perhaps built to see too comfortably yet three to four children how to

2425
03:40:13.52 --> 03:40:19.52
did each desk each little group would share one pencil stub pass get back and forth among themselves

2426
03:40:19.52 --> 03:40:24.56
working on just a few sheets of paper these desks and pencils were the only school equipment I saw

2427
03:40:24.56 --> 03:40:29.28
when I asked why the Iraqi children didn't have more supplies the surprising answer came back because we

2428
03:40:29.28 --> 03:40:35.52
can't get them skipping forward here as we headed back to base in our convoy and idea

2429
03:40:36.08 --> 03:40:41.04
started to percolate in the back of my mind but I didn't say anything at first it was wasn't a big

2430
03:40:41.04 --> 03:40:46.24
idea initially it was just simply reflecting the phrase that was digging deep into my heart I can do more

2431
03:40:47.44 --> 03:40:54.08
and then you start going and gathering up school supplies for Iraqi children and that

2432
03:40:54.08 --> 03:41:01.68
becomes your next it's your next tactical mission was getting these getting kids school supplies over there

2433
03:41:01.68 --> 03:41:10.40
you hook up with Laura Heldonbrand who wrote C. Biscuit and Unbroken and you start this this thing

2434
03:41:11.04 --> 03:41:18.88
operation Iraqi children which eventually becomes operation international children and you guys

2435
03:41:18.88 --> 03:41:29.36
just supply supply all this all this gear to these kids well the the important part of that was

2436
03:41:29.36 --> 03:41:35.12
that we wanted to give it to the troops to give to the kids got it so our our little motto was helping

2437
03:41:35.12 --> 03:41:41.76
soldiers help children I I just felt you know on that first trip to the school I saw and

2438
03:41:41.76 --> 03:41:47.12
watched the kids were loving the soldiers you know the soldiers rebuilt the school they came in

2439
03:41:47.12 --> 03:41:52.08
there but windows in they did all kinds of stuff for the kids and the kids were very grateful the

2440
03:41:52.08 --> 03:41:58.48
soldiers were just hugging the kids and it was a spirit that I thought was very important to preserve in

2441
03:41:58.48 --> 03:42:05.68
some way and so I thought well maybe we can collect some school supplies and send them to those

2442
03:42:05.68 --> 03:42:10.56
troops and they can take them out to the school and give them to the kids and that's what we did we

2443
03:42:10.56 --> 03:42:15.12
collected stuff at my kid school and we shipped it over to that base and they took it out gave

2444
03:42:15.12 --> 03:42:22.08
to the kids and it turned into a program that lasted nine years and we sent hundreds of thousands

2445
03:42:22.64 --> 03:42:30.08
of schools to apply kids soccer balls shoes all kinds of stuff but to not only Iraq but

2446
03:42:30.08 --> 03:42:36.24
Afghanistan Haiti all these different places yeah that's that's a that's a strategic move too because

2447
03:42:36.24 --> 03:42:41.20
as these young kids see the American soldiers what do they see of them right they see guys with

2448
03:42:41.20 --> 03:42:47.92
guns they see guys kicking indoors and that can obviously give a real negative impression but

2449
03:42:47.92 --> 03:42:52.96
then when they see the kid I mean they see a soldier and he's given them crayons and soccer balls

2450
03:42:52.96 --> 03:42:57.12
and whatnot all of a sudden they realize oh these guys are these guys are here to help

2451
03:42:57.68 --> 03:43:03.04
which is sometimes not obvious that that was the important part of what we're trying to do

2452
03:43:03.04 --> 03:43:08.88
I knew I couldn't keep running over to Iraq every month you know but I wanted to do something

2453
03:43:08.88 --> 03:43:13.76
from home and so supplying the troops was something that gives the kids was a way that we could do that

2454
03:43:15.36 --> 03:43:19.28
and then you just get involved in all kinds of things in trepid fallen heroes found

2455
03:43:19.28 --> 03:43:25.36
Fisher house foundation tragedy assistance program for survivors you end up doing something called

2456
03:43:25.36 --> 03:43:31.68
the snowball express idea was simple going from the book they brought they brought the children of

2457
03:43:31.68 --> 03:43:35.76
our fallen heroes to Disneyland just before Christmas to allow them to meet each other to see they

2458
03:43:35.76 --> 03:43:40.40
were not alone in their grief and to bring them some joy and new happy memories to this special

2459
03:43:40.40 --> 03:43:49.68
group of children who are experiencing so much sadness especially at Christmas and and and you go on

2460
03:43:49.68 --> 03:43:55.04
talking about that I could not be prouder to be part of creating opportunities for joy friendship

2461
03:43:55.04 --> 03:44:00.48
and communal healing by connecting family struggling with loss to one another together they share

2462
03:44:00.48 --> 03:44:05.92
a common bond and can feel a bigger part of a bigger family the children meet and interact with

2463
03:44:05.92 --> 03:44:10.88
others who understand what they've been through and each and help each other through this unique

2464
03:44:10.88 --> 03:44:16.56
and terrible experience they cannot be overstated what an event like this can mean to a child who is

2465
03:44:16.56 --> 03:44:22.40
lost a parent or in military service struggling with their grief can be overwhelming and

2466
03:44:22.40 --> 03:44:26.56
you nighting together with hundreds of other children experience a similar tragic loss can be the

2467
03:44:26.56 --> 03:44:33.12
magic that carries them throughout the year there's so much joy on their faces during these moments

2468
03:44:33.12 --> 03:44:39.84
it's a blessing to interact with kids this way at the same time I'm always reminded of the

2469
03:44:39.84 --> 03:44:46.000
celebrity embedded in these moments of the incredible cost represented in the faces of the children

2470
03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:54.08
who come to this event last year one girl wore a t-shirt to the event with these words printed on the

2471
03:44:54.08 --> 03:45:01.28
back in honor and memory of an underneath the words was a blank box where kids could write in the

2472
03:45:01.28 --> 03:45:18.56
name of their fallen hero in black marker the girl had simply written my daddy and that's a

2473
03:45:18.56 --> 03:45:28.16
that program you know we're about to the foundation the Gary Sonny's foundation that was a

2474
03:45:28.16 --> 03:45:34.24
that was an organization that was started and every year I would go back and play a concert for the kids

2475
03:45:34.24 --> 03:45:40.72
and be a part of the event American Airlines supplies all the transportation to get all the kids from

2476
03:45:40.72 --> 03:45:49.20
all over the country to the to the event and a couple of years ago we folded that particular

2477
03:45:49.84 --> 03:45:56.40
thing into the Gary Sonny's foundation as a program and we moved the event from Dallas where it had been

2478
03:45:56.40 --> 03:46:04.40
for nine years to Disney World so we take over a thousand kids to Disney World along with you know

2479
03:46:04.40 --> 03:46:11.68
four five hundred surviving parent or guardian or who's who's ever with the kids and we give them a

2480
03:46:11.68 --> 03:46:17.28
lot of joy right before Christmas time at that the happiest place on earth it's extraordinary

2481
03:46:17.28 --> 03:46:23.36
and my band has played concerts for the last I don't know 13 years something like that

2482
03:46:24.48 --> 03:46:24.96
awesome

2483
03:46:24.96 --> 03:46:28.96
um

2484
03:46:33.04 --> 03:46:37.28
going back to these um hospital visits

2485
03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:47.52
back to the book after a bomb exploded and I rack in July of 2003 Marine Staff Sergeant Mark

2486
03:46:47.52 --> 03:46:55.92
Gronke he said that right lost an eye hand fingers thumb and right leg I met Mark on my first

2487
03:46:55.92 --> 03:47:02.08
visit to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on September 11th 2003 where he was

2488
03:47:02.08 --> 03:47:06.56
recovering he was the first wounded service member I visited on the first of many trips over the

2489
03:47:06.56 --> 03:47:12.56
years to where to to the DC military hospitals he wanted to talk about Lieutenant Dan

2490
03:47:12.56 --> 03:47:18.40
and we shared a few stories and I sat with him for a while before I went on to the next room

2491
03:47:19.84 --> 03:47:24.48
that afternoon I was at Walter Reed for the first time I visited with so many wounded heroes that

2492
03:47:24.48 --> 03:47:31.44
day including many of the first triple amputees I would meet in the coming years just 21 year old

2493
03:47:31.44 --> 03:47:39.04
just 21 years old US Army Specialist hilarious bramannus was serving with the 82nd Airborne

2494
03:47:39.04 --> 03:47:44.88
Division in Baghdad on June 10th just 10 days before I would be in Baghdad myself specials

2495
03:47:44.88 --> 03:47:51.28
bramannus and a fellow soldier came under attack while guarding a weapons turn in point a rocket

2496
03:47:51.28 --> 03:47:57.68
propelled grenade killed his friend and took both bramannus's legs and his left hand as bramannus

2497
03:47:57.68 --> 03:48:01.92
laying his bed as father stood by a side and told me what had happened and how hilarious

2498
03:48:01.92 --> 03:48:10.16
video was from one of the tiny islands in the feathered states of micronesia three years earlier

2499
03:48:10.16 --> 03:48:13.68
wanting to be an American soldier he'd gone to Guam to sign up for the US Army

2500
03:48:15.12 --> 03:48:21.36
the week after my visit in a ceremony at Walter Reed on September 17th 2003 bramannus was awarded

2501
03:48:21.36 --> 03:48:28.000
US citizenship I'll always remember that first visit meeting specialist bramannus

2502
03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:33.92
and so many other seniors young man in a hospital bed missing three out of four limbs

2503
03:48:35.52 --> 03:48:38.96
yet made a lasting impression on me

2504
03:48:44.96 --> 03:48:49.04
and at one point some of your friends and some of the partners from operation international

2505
03:48:49.04 --> 03:48:53.36
children they weren't able to go to Iraq so they went over they delivered supplies

2506
03:48:53.36 --> 03:48:57.36
and they stopped at launch to win Germany on the way back and going back to the book here

2507
03:48:57.36 --> 03:49:03.84
there they met a young soldier named Brendan Morocco just 22 years old the first United

2508
03:49:03.84 --> 03:49:08.24
States service member ever to survive after losing all four limbs in an IED explosion

2509
03:49:09.92 --> 03:49:14.16
the blast happened during the early hours of Easter Sunday while Brendan was returning

2510
03:49:14.16 --> 03:49:20.32
from a night mission in the deserts of Iraq he was in bad shape in addition to loosing both arms

2511
03:49:20.32 --> 03:49:25.28
and both legs Brendan's nose left eye socket and facial bones were broken

2512
03:49:25.28 --> 03:49:31.84
he lost eight teeth from the bat blast and had taken sharp known as left eye and face

2513
03:49:33.28 --> 03:49:40.72
his face and neck and bit burned his left carotid artery severed and his left ear drum pierced

2514
03:49:42.88 --> 03:49:48.96
usually a soldier this severely wounded would die but army medics had been making remarkable

2515
03:49:48.96 --> 03:49:57.60
strides in meeting bat in treating battlefield wounds and you go into some details here but

2516
03:49:59.12 --> 03:50:06.000
a guy named Sal Cassano my saying that right he's the commissioner of the New York fire department

2517
03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:13.20
and they wanted to raise money to build Brendan Morocco especially adapted smart technology home

2518
03:50:13.20 --> 03:50:18.64
in Staten Island they asked if you would help you know raise funds going back to the book as we

2519
03:50:18.64 --> 03:50:23.68
were planning a fundraising concert for Brendan to be held in Staten Island in August of 2010

2520
03:50:23.68 --> 03:50:28.88
I received another call in March 26th 2010 while leading a squad of Marines on a security patrol

2521
03:50:28.88 --> 03:50:35.36
in Afghanistan corporal Todd nicely 26 headstep on an IED buried at the foot of a bridge

2522
03:50:37.52 --> 03:50:41.60
his fellow Marines quickly wrapped turnic hits around his wounds and administered more

2523
03:50:41.60 --> 03:50:48.40
a fine rescue helicopter arrived within six minutes he became the second US service member to survive

2524
03:50:48.40 --> 03:50:56.08
her injuries as a quadruple amputee I met Todd in the hospital then simply said to the tunnel

2525
03:50:56.08 --> 03:51:01.36
to towers guys which the guys that are running this um this charity he needs a house too let's do

2526
03:51:01.36 --> 03:51:07.68
another concert even before we played Brendan's concert we received a third call on May 24th

2527
03:51:07.68 --> 03:51:13.20
2010 sergeant John Peck had just finished sweeping a compound with the metal detector checking

2528
03:51:13.20 --> 03:51:20.96
for bombs when he stepped on an IED he became America's third surviving quadruple amputee

2529
03:51:20.96 --> 03:51:25.04
we decided to raise funds to help build homes for all three quadruple amputees

2530
03:51:25.68 --> 03:51:29.92
back before my foundation was created it was no simple matter to help

2531
03:51:30.96 --> 03:51:36.48
raise about a half a million bucks for each home project it still isn't a simple matter today

2532
03:51:36.48 --> 03:51:43.84
but I wanted to do everything I could do to help in time we built homes for all three quadruple

2533
03:51:43.84 --> 03:51:49.44
amputees and this new initiative steam rolled from there the good news was that thanks to new

2534
03:51:49.44 --> 03:51:54.08
sophisticated life saving techniques on the battlefield more soldiers started surviving these horrific

2535
03:51:54.08 --> 03:52:00.16
injuries the bad news was that after Brendan Todd and John more soldiers were wounded similar

2536
03:52:00.16 --> 03:52:09.28
similarly staff sergeant Travis Mills was our fourth quadruple amputee a highly capable and

2537
03:52:09.28 --> 03:52:15.04
resilient squad leader he later joked at his injury in afghanistan was only a bad case of the

2538
03:52:15.04 --> 03:52:21.68
Mondays like so many of the wounded service members of Matt Travis is one of my heroes

2539
03:52:21.68 --> 03:52:31.84
and we remain close friends to this day and Travis was on this podcast number 90 if you want to

2540
03:52:32.48 --> 03:52:38.88
if you want to realize what a hero sounds like go listen to that navy petty officer

2541
03:52:39.52 --> 03:52:44.32
Taylor Morris a member of an explosive ordinance disposal team became our nation's fifth surviving

2542
03:52:44.32 --> 03:52:49.12
quadruple amputee from the wars in Iraq and afghanistan immediately after the blast that took

2543
03:52:49.12 --> 03:52:55.84
his four limbs Taylor lay on the afghan soil fully conscious bleeding to death but before

2544
03:52:55.84 --> 03:53:00.56
medics attended him Taylor ordered them to wait and make sure the ground surrounding him was

2545
03:53:00.56 --> 03:53:09.92
clear of ideas he didn't want any other service members getting wounded where do they find such men

2546
03:53:09.92 --> 03:53:23.20
yeah that's um i mean uh haven't spent a decent amount of time with Travis

2547
03:53:23.20 --> 03:53:38.88
uh yeah if that guy's uh not a hero then i have no idea who is

2548
03:53:42.72 --> 03:53:48.24
well he's an he's an amazing guy and he's doing something really positive with his circumstance and

2549
03:53:48.24 --> 03:53:55.44
he's helping and fellow veterans uh with his own foundation Travis milk foundation obviously wrote a

2550
03:53:55.44 --> 03:54:02.24
book there was a movie uh Travis is an ambassador for my foundation so he'll do things from time to time to

2551
03:54:02.24 --> 03:54:10.64
help us uh do more and you know i've met just extraordinary people we've we've done

2552
03:54:10.64 --> 03:54:20.48
over sixty or seventy of these houses now um for very very badly wounded folks you know in all

2553
03:54:20.48 --> 03:54:25.92
branches of service and it's been a privilege because i've learned quite a bit from a number of them

2554
03:54:25.92 --> 03:54:33.12
and uh have many many friends who you know are in the wounded community as i said i've been

2555
03:54:33.12 --> 03:54:39.76
involved with a d a b for many many years and so like i have many wounded pals from a lot of different

2556
03:54:39.76 --> 03:54:46.88
wars and they they they give me a lot of inspiration little a lot of motivation to keep doing more

2557
03:54:56.88 --> 03:55:00.72
you go on here another busy you as planned for 2010 35 concerts

2558
03:55:01.60 --> 03:55:05.60
and additional events and supportive our troops they were still out there fighting

2559
03:55:05.60 --> 03:55:12.32
and i kept doing so much because it needed to be done but i was tired i was wondering how long

2560
03:55:12.32 --> 03:55:17.04
i could keep up this pace what i'd be able to continue like this or what i'd burn out yet i

2561
03:55:17.04 --> 03:55:21.84
envisioned a future doing still more and i wanted to figure out a way to ramp up not pull back

2562
03:55:22.40 --> 03:55:29.36
my work since i could see the positive efforts we were having the question was how i began to consider

2563
03:55:29.36 --> 03:55:36.88
consolidating my mission under one umbrella continuing to work while focusing my priorities in the

2564
03:55:36.88 --> 03:55:41.28
most effective way possible having teamed up with many organizations and efforts in the military

2565
03:55:41.28 --> 03:55:46.40
support space i learned a great deal about many different areas of need i could strategically harness

2566
03:55:46.40 --> 03:55:51.04
the incredible power of the many volunteers who worked alongside me over the years and could help

2567
03:55:51.04 --> 03:55:55.84
serve them our military veterans and first responder communities more effectively too

2568
03:55:55.84 --> 03:56:01.52
i could still point donors in a good direction and courage generosity of the american people to

2569
03:56:01.52 --> 03:56:07.12
support quality projects i was involved in but i could do it more consistently under this one umbrella

2570
03:56:07.12 --> 03:56:11.28
thinking through all that the solution became clear my own foundation

2571
03:56:13.84 --> 03:56:17.92
and you called it out here i've been involved in so many different types of initiatives at this

2572
03:56:17.92 --> 03:56:22.16
point and even though i was consolidating efforts i still wanted to keep the mission statement

2573
03:56:22.16 --> 03:56:27.44
broad reflecting the support work i don't over the years and so we could always adapt to changing

2574
03:56:27.44 --> 03:56:32.88
needs of our veterans we came up with this mission statement at the garyf synise foundation

2575
03:56:32.88 --> 03:56:39.04
we serve our nation by honoring our defenders veterans first responders their families and those in need

2576
03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:45.12
we do this by creating and supporting unique programs designed to entertain, educate, inspire,

2577
03:56:45.12 --> 03:56:56.96
strengthen and build communities yeah you got to a point where you had to kind of consolidate

2578
03:56:57.60 --> 03:57:04.000
your efforts yeah i in the in the back of the book there there's there's a list of maybe 30 different

2579
03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:11.20
charities that i was supporting and you know in various ways i would i wanted to do a lot for

2580
03:57:11.20 --> 03:57:20.40
uh as many veterans as possible so i chose to do that initially by not only doing us oh tours but

2581
03:57:20.40 --> 03:57:27.92
supporting non-profit organizations that were really doing a good job in the military support space

2582
03:57:27.92 --> 03:57:34.80
so i would do PSA for them i would fundraise for them i would lend my name i'd be on their honorary

2583
03:57:34.80 --> 03:57:42.88
advisory boards i would but it would it it went on and on and on and then i was like you know

2584
03:57:42.88 --> 03:57:48.24
right before i started the foundation i launched the foundation garyston use foundation 2011 so

2585
03:57:48.24 --> 03:57:55.52
the chapter in the book called flurry of action kind of talks about 2009 2010 the two years

2586
03:57:55.52 --> 03:58:02.96
leading up to the founding of the foundation because those year i was just ramping more more more

2587
03:58:02.96 --> 03:58:08.48
and all the while i was i was shooting a television series right away at the same time so i was never

2588
03:58:08.48 --> 03:58:14.64
home i was shooting the show or gone on the weekends doing something helping some organization out

2589
03:58:14.64 --> 03:58:20.88
and i thought this is you know i need to figure out some other way to do this and having been involved

2590
03:58:20.88 --> 03:58:29.20
with so many military charities over the years and had established a good reputation within the

2591
03:58:29.20 --> 03:58:34.88
support space you know that it's a you know people knew i was there for real and i kept coming back

2592
03:58:34.88 --> 03:58:42.000
and i'm you know wasn't something i did once and and i was i was ongoing it was part of my life

2593
03:58:42.000 --> 03:58:50.16
so i thought let's capitalize on that in some way and and create an organization that can you know

2594
03:58:50.16 --> 03:58:56.40
act as a reliable resource for people who want to support our veterans and military community

2595
03:58:56.40 --> 03:59:02.32
and that's why i named it the gerryzonese foundation i mean people knew who i was at that point

2596
03:59:02.32 --> 03:59:07.28
they knew i was in this for good i could have called it to help the troops foundation or something

2597
03:59:07.28 --> 03:59:13.04
like that but i decided to put my name on it because i had you know i'd taken action

2598
03:59:13.76 --> 03:59:20.000
and uh and people were supporting that so i thought a lot the the whole purpose of having

2599
03:59:20.000 --> 03:59:26.48
foundations to raise money so that you can do more and i wanted to raise a lot of money to do a lot

2600
03:59:26.48 --> 03:59:31.92
more and that's what we're doing well just like any brand when you know the brand and you know

2601
03:59:31.92 --> 03:59:36.40
it's quality because let's face it i mean the charitable organizations there's good ones and there's

2602
03:59:36.40 --> 03:59:41.36
bad ones and so if you have a good reputation inside of a brand that people know that you're doing the

2603
03:59:41.36 --> 03:59:46.88
right thing then why not like you said capitalize on that and and make it obvious

2604
03:59:46.88 --> 03:59:53.12
yeah because i made a decision that this is look i'm this isn't something i'm going to stop

2605
03:59:53.12 --> 03:59:59.28
doing i'm going to keep doing it so let's let's figure out the best way to do it in the most

2606
03:59:59.28 --> 04:00:05.36
effective way that you know will will be there for a long time i hope to create a foundation and

2607
04:00:05.36 --> 04:00:11.60
and i think we're well on our way to doing that uh that that that is here for the long term

2608
04:00:11.60 --> 04:00:18.80
that hopefully it will survive me and go on and keep helping people in the spirit of

2609
04:00:18.80 --> 04:00:27.76
personal touches that i've tried to give it and it will be there you know and last you know

2610
04:00:27.76 --> 04:00:35.20
in for decades that's that's what i hope i'm i'm in it for good it's a meaningful mission

2611
04:00:35.20 --> 04:00:44.32
service has been a great thing for my life and i think you know we're helping a lot of people

2612
04:00:44.32 --> 04:00:50.64
now and i can see that that what we've you know the building blocks that we've laid here over this

2613
04:00:50.64 --> 04:00:56.56
time are solid and people trusted and want to support it well some of the work that you're doing

2614
04:00:56.56 --> 04:01:04.56
is incredible and we like um you got this we built a home for us on army ranger sergeant first

2615
04:01:04.56 --> 04:01:11.36
class Michael slits who served as a rifleman of patoon sergeant southern i rack on February 27

2616
04:01:11.36 --> 04:01:16.16

2622
04:01:51.68 --> 04:01:55.76
called operation men consisting of a team of sergeant who helped provide free surgeries

2623
04:01:56.40 --> 04:02:01.92
to our severely wounded veterans when i first met Mike he was so severely burned he didn't have a

2624
04:02:01.92 --> 04:02:09.92
nose and he talked through a hole in his throat we struck up a friendship over the years he's

2625
04:02:09.92 --> 04:02:15.28
had multiple reconstructive surgeries to repair the damage to his eyelids mouth and nose and

2626
04:02:15.28 --> 04:02:21.52
other parts of his body where the skin was burned having last lost both arms he now uses to

2627
04:02:21.52 --> 04:02:27.92
prosthetic hooks Mike's living situation post innumerable challenges for him because the

2628
04:02:27.92 --> 04:02:32.64
fragility of his skin Mike preferred colder temperatures and often needed to turn the air conditioner

2629
04:02:32.64 --> 04:02:40.64
on full blast his mom robby in his full-time caregiver and she wore heavy coats to keep warm in

2630
04:02:40.64 --> 04:02:44.64
the house direct sunlight is hard on mics eye so he preferred to keep all the shades drawn

2631
04:02:46.24 --> 04:02:51.20
we built them a home with one section for mic and another for his mom with a temperature and

2632
04:02:51.20 --> 04:02:55.92
light needs section the house could be individually governed Mike has a special shower and the

2633
04:02:55.92 --> 04:03:02.08
gym that he can navigate by himself we helped restore mics independence and helped empower them both

2634
04:03:02.08 --> 04:03:06.88
Mike is an amazing individual who's dedicating his life to honoring his fallen brothers

2635
04:03:06.88 --> 04:03:12.24
through serving his fellow veterans and ambassador for my foundation he helps us with our veterans

2636
04:03:12.24 --> 04:03:20.64
outreach as our military and veterans resource manager with our smart home program we work with each

2637
04:03:20.64 --> 04:03:25.92
wounded service member to provide exactly what they need master sergeant john Mason

2638
04:03:27.28 --> 04:03:33.28
is married and has three kids on October 16th 2010 while conducting village stability operations

2639
04:03:33.28 --> 04:03:38.32
in can to hard province afghanistan john a medic with a 20th special forces group step on a hidden

2640
04:03:38.32 --> 04:03:46.32
ID and lost both legs and his left arm due to the severity of his amputations he can't wear

2641
04:03:46.32 --> 04:03:51.36
prosthetics and he's confined to a wheelchair the hallways in his house were too narrow for a wheelchair

2642
04:03:51.36 --> 04:03:55.60
additionally he couldn't reach anything in the closets and the bathroom is too small for him to navigate

2643
04:03:55.60 --> 04:04:02.88
alone so we built john a house for him and his family that allows him to be independent and

2644
04:04:02.88 --> 04:04:08.000
internal allows his wife and children to worry less about caring for him we built a home for captain

2645
04:04:08.000 --> 04:04:20.32
Luis avila and his family Luis served five combat tours in afghanistan in Iraq on December 27,

04:04:20.32 --> 04:04:28.32
2011 Luis's vehicle ran over an iED Luis lost his left leg then suffered two strokes and two

2647
04:04:28.32 --> 04:04:33.92
heart attacks resulting in traumatic brain injury ultimately he was left almost completely paralyzed

2648
04:04:33.92 --> 04:04:38.96
today he continues to heal while maintaining an incredibly positive attitude and sense of humor

2649
04:04:40.64 --> 04:04:45.84
his wife kawty is his full-time caregiver and never leads leaves his side she is one of the

2650
04:04:45.84 --> 04:04:51.92
fierce fighters for the needs of our wounded service members and reminds us of the importance of also

2651
04:04:51.92 --> 04:04:57.52
supporting our caregivers each smart home is given to the veteran free of charge

2652
04:04:57.52 --> 04:05:05.12
the mortgage for the house and land is completely underwritten the veteran can select what part of

2653
04:05:05.12 --> 04:05:14.72
the country he or she wants to live in we built a home for police officer Michael Flamian

2654
04:05:15.92 --> 04:05:20.64
from ballwin miserry you shot in the neck by an assailant during a routine traffic stop and his

2655
04:05:20.64 --> 04:05:27.92
paralyzed from the neck down his wife is now his full-time caregiver and the home built specifically

2656
04:05:27.92 --> 04:05:31.52
from Michael's challenges provide some much needed support and relief

2657
04:05:38.56 --> 04:05:44.24
so i mean those if you if you can listen to those and recognize what you're doing i mean that's just

2658
04:05:44.24 --> 04:05:52.000
phenomenal phenomenal and you know we we already talked about this but i'll i'll add this little thing

2659
04:05:52.000 --> 04:06:00.000
you got a program called soring vallar and one of the things you did with the navy with the

2660
04:06:00.000 --> 04:06:05.76
national world more to me is amonyor leans is uh made a film you did the you did the voice over for the

2661
04:06:05.76 --> 04:06:12.16
film and in the film you the voice you you use or the the person you're you're uh what is it acting

2662
04:06:12.16 --> 04:06:20.16
portraying portraying is irney pile the famous war correspondent who wrote dispatches from the

2663
04:06:20.16 --> 04:06:27.60
war zones in europe and asia and yeah that's how i got involved with the world war two museum

2664
04:06:28.32 --> 04:06:34.08
you know over ten years ago they in tom hanks was one of the producers on that film

2665
04:06:35.12 --> 04:06:41.84
and uh he invited me to play irney pile so i did the voice over for irney that started my relationship

2666
04:06:41.84 --> 04:06:47.60
with the world war two museum now we've taken through my foundation and our soring vallar program

2667
04:06:47.60 --> 04:06:54.000
we've taken hundreds of world war two veterans down to see them using him and we've recorded them

2668
04:06:54.56 --> 04:07:01.44
on video telling their stories and those stories are preserved in the library at the museum

2669
04:07:02.64 --> 04:07:08.000
well two things number one we covered her a pile on this podcast right here number 39

2670
04:07:08.000 --> 04:07:13.92
and if you don't know this about irney pile he was actually killed in action in the battle of

2671
04:07:13.92 --> 04:07:20.64
okinawa and two i don't know what we can do to get the the recordings out of the library and into

2672
04:07:20.64 --> 04:07:27.20
the interwebs but we should do that let's get them out there

2673
04:07:30.16 --> 04:07:33.04
the the stuff that you you know again another example

2674
04:07:33.04 --> 04:07:39.76
staff sergeant Jason Ross March 2011 during a second deployment to Afghanistan Jason

2675
04:07:39.76 --> 04:07:44.64
lost both of his legs part of his pelvic bone where an ID exploded doctors gave him

2676
04:07:44.64 --> 04:07:49.76
less than 2% chances survival but Jason never stopped fighting complication said in

2677
04:07:49.76 --> 04:07:54.48
insurgents ended up needing to take more and more from his legs until eventually all his hips were gone

2678
04:07:54.48 --> 04:08:05.12
to date he's undergone more than 240 surgeries basically the entire lower half of his body is no longer

2679
04:08:05.12 --> 04:08:11.92
there we built a smart home for Jason and his family in San Diego when we handed over the keys to

2680
04:08:11.92 --> 04:08:19.36
him in his ceremony his six-year-old daughter Stacy asked to speak my daddy is Jason Ross she said

2681
04:08:19.36 --> 04:08:25.04
when i was little my daddy got hurt now Afghanistan he was in the hospital for a long time

2682
04:08:27.60 --> 04:08:31.84
my daddy is strong and brave

2683
04:08:41.52 --> 04:08:47.68
another thing you guys do you talk about here my my foundation's final program is called relief

2684
04:08:47.68 --> 04:08:52.64
and resiliency outreach this is an umbrella program we simply try to help veterans and their family

2685
04:08:52.64 --> 04:08:58.000
in any way possible including those recovering from trauma injury or loss within the umbrella

2686
04:08:58.000 --> 04:09:02.88
is a mentoring program i've had a long relationship with a disabled american veterans d a v and no

2687
04:09:02.88 --> 04:09:07.36
several wounded veterans who've lived with their injuries for decades so i thought of providing

2688
04:09:07.36 --> 04:09:12.48
an opportunity to induce introduce some of our younger wounded veterans from i rack and afghanistan

2689
04:09:12.48 --> 04:09:20.000
to veterans from previous wars i met with gym surzley the enom veteran triple amputee

2690
04:09:20.000 --> 04:09:24.96
and former national commander of the d a v to gout to gage his interest and get his thoughts

2691
04:09:24.96 --> 04:09:28.40
he responded positively and said he would love to be involved and that he would discuss it with

2692
04:09:28.40 --> 04:09:35.68
the d a v leadership and if you want to know about more than more about gym surzley layers podcast

2693
04:09:35.68 --> 04:09:44.16
200 in here talking about his story which is which is incredible

2694
04:09:46.56 --> 04:09:51.84
and you close this section out by saying the simple story is here that from its creation in 2011

2695
04:09:52.88 --> 04:09:58.32
the foundation is grown into a friendly giant we've gone from one donor just me in the beginning

2696
04:09:58.32 --> 04:10:02.72
to a base of more than 45 thousand donors in a annual budget of nearly 30 million

2697
04:10:02.72 --> 04:10:08.80
while we can never do enough to show our gratitude to our nation's defenders of veterans

2698
04:10:08.80 --> 04:10:14.48
of first responders and the families who live serve alongside them and you have this little

2699
04:10:15.20 --> 04:10:23.12
mantra, this little motto we can always do a little more and

2700
04:10:23.12 --> 04:10:36.16
I think the idea of we can always do a little more is probably a good place to wrap even though

2701
04:10:36.16 --> 04:10:39.68
it's not the last chapter the last chapter is actually called why i'm still on a mission

2702
04:10:41.68 --> 04:10:46.48
and obviously there's an important message there but that also ties in with the motto we can

2703
04:10:46.48 --> 04:10:52.16
always do a little bit more and I guess still have to buy the book to get that last

2704
04:10:52.16 --> 04:11:02.08
yes indeed and the book contains a lot of reasons why we all still need to stay on mission

2705
04:11:02.08 --> 04:11:08.16
and as I was preparing to do this podcast I knew that I would be reading your words

2706
04:11:10.32 --> 04:11:15.28
and then I fought back to a time when you actually read some of my words when

2707
04:11:15.28 --> 04:11:22.64
when Mikey Montsour was killed and I racked I gave a speech at his

2708
04:11:23.84 --> 04:11:33.28
memorial service in Ramadi and the theme of that speech was Roger that

2709
04:11:35.68 --> 04:11:43.36
because I told the story where I had told Mike and the rest of the new guys in the task unit

2710
04:11:43.36 --> 04:11:49.52
that when the instructor cadre from the training attachment came and told them to do something

2711
04:11:49.52 --> 04:11:54.40
or corrected them or yelled at them the only thing they were allowed to say back was Roger that

2712
04:11:57.52 --> 04:12:02.48
and so a couple days went by and one of the master chiefs who was a friend of mine

2713
04:12:03.28 --> 04:12:07.84
he came up to me and he said okay what that was up with this Montsour guy and I said what he

2714
04:12:07.84 --> 04:12:11.12
mean he says every time I every time I tell him to do something fix something he just looks at me

2715
04:12:11.12 --> 04:12:18.000
and he means his Roger that and I said hey man that's exactly what I told him to say

2716
04:12:18.88 --> 04:12:22.80
and and that actually became Mikey's attitude and no matter what he was asked to do no matter

2717
04:12:22.80 --> 04:12:28.64
how hard the task his response was always Roger that including when a grenade was thrown

2718
04:12:29.60 --> 04:12:33.20
that threatened the lives of three of her other teammates

2719
04:12:33.20 --> 04:12:42.48
then only one person could save them was Mikey and in order to do so he had to smother that grenade

2720
04:12:42.48 --> 04:12:44.96
with his own body and sacrifice his life

2721
04:12:49.12 --> 04:12:51.76
for his friends and in that moment of truth

2722
04:12:57.84 --> 04:12:59.12
his response was the same

2723
04:12:59.12 --> 04:13:03.44
Roger that

2724
04:13:07.76 --> 04:13:13.52
and a few years later at the Republican National Convention there was a tribute to Mikey

2725
04:13:15.12 --> 04:13:21.76
and it was rooted in the same fan theme and clearly it had been taken from the ulog that I delivered

2726
04:13:21.76 --> 04:13:30.96
in the dusty hanger with a broken heart and a mighty Iraq just after Mikey was killed and that

2727
04:13:30.96 --> 04:13:40.40
theme was Roger that and the tribute for Mikey was delivered by none other than Gary Sinese

2728
04:13:40.40 --> 04:13:54.40
and it was a fitting tribute fit for a hero such as Mikey

2729
04:13:58.96 --> 04:14:06.16
who continues every day to inspire us all to do a little more

2730
04:14:06.16 --> 04:14:15.44
and to live our lives as grateful Americans

2731
04:14:29.12 --> 04:14:30.48
so I thank you for doing that Gary

2732
04:14:30.48 --> 04:14:40.56
and welcome it was a privilege I didn't know that came from New Jacko that's amazing

2733
04:14:40.56 --> 04:14:48.32
I looked it up recently I told you I want to do something on the one-year anniversary of

2734
04:14:48.32 --> 04:14:56.56
the commissioning of Mike's ship and so I posted something on my social media

2735
04:14:56.56 --> 04:15:04.32
and I found that video somehow that somebody had kind of filmed of their TV and it was of

2736
04:15:04.32 --> 04:15:11.84
that of that video that they showed that I narrated and included that and then I wanted to look

2737
04:15:11.84 --> 04:15:17.28
up some more and I found I found the piece that you wrote after the ship was commissioned

2738
04:15:18.08 --> 04:15:24.56
and included it there but did not know that some of those words that I said and that

2739
04:15:24.56 --> 04:15:30.40
that beautiful piece and I thought they did a very good job with it and I didn't know that they

2740
04:15:30.40 --> 04:15:39.60
came from you that I bless you it was not over to here and well I told you I wasn't sure how long

2741
04:15:39.60 --> 04:15:47.20

2747
04:16:33.44 --> 04:16:42.08
because it's a I think when I think is in some ways a little bit of a call to action

2748
04:16:42.08 --> 04:16:49.68
I tried to tell a story of somebody who didn't see it coming but all of a sudden

2749
04:16:51.12 --> 04:16:58.72
made a turn toward a service life which is basically that's what I do now you know I've done

2750
04:16:58.72 --> 04:17:05.04
well in my acting career I was grateful that I had CSI New York as it gave me a lot of resources

2924
04:35:58.16 --> 04:36:03.76
in the military and our first responders I'm talking about being grateful for life

2925
04:36:07.60 --> 04:36:14.96
because it's here and it's now and there are so many men and women that have sacrificed so much

2926
04:36:14.96 --> 04:36:22.80
for us that we can be here in a world that is overflowing with opportunity

2927
04:36:26.88 --> 04:36:30.64
so be grateful for that and then show gratitude

2928
04:36:34.16 --> 04:36:39.60
show gratitude to those that have served not just by saying thank you

2929
04:36:39.60 --> 04:36:46.96
show gratitude not just with your words but by going out and taking action

2930
04:36:47.84 --> 04:36:53.36
making things happen show them gratitude by going out there in the world

2931
04:36:56.48 --> 04:36:57.44
