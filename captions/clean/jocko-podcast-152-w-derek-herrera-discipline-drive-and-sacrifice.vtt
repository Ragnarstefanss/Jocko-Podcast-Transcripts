00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.54
This is Jockel Podcast number 152.

2
00:00:03.54 --> 00:00:06.72
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:08.12
Good evening echo.

4
00:00:08.12 --> 00:00:09.12
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.12 --> 00:00:19.36
These are men that would rather die than live with the shame that they didn't offer their last

6
00:00:19.36 --> 00:00:24.80
breath in service to the men to their left and to their right in battle.

7
00:00:24.80 --> 00:00:32.56
Each man was shaped through immense trials, personal fortitude and dedication, giving

8
00:00:32.56 --> 00:00:34.96
all he had to offer.

9
00:00:34.96 --> 00:00:42.76
At times, when only the great pride of walking in the path least traveled was there to keep

10
00:00:42.76 --> 00:00:45.000
him company.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.54
Through constant discipline, drive and sacrifice, they have risen to the top of their

12
00:00:51.54 --> 00:00:56.66
trade and embodied the ethos of the marine radar.

13
00:00:56.66 --> 00:01:03.86
A man who displays the very pinnacle of soldiery virtue and unwavering loyalty.

14
00:01:03.86 --> 00:01:11.62
A man who will never quit or surrender and who will at all times stand ready to sacrifice

15
00:01:11.62 --> 00:01:17.94
whatever is needed to accomplish the mission.

16
00:01:17.94 --> 00:01:27.34
They stand as shiny examples of what our nation intrus its freedom and respect to.

17
00:01:27.34 --> 00:01:33.94
Nothing is more awe-inspiring than the look on a fellow operator's face as they are surrounded

18
00:01:33.94 --> 00:01:37.30
by death.

19
00:01:37.30 --> 00:01:45.62
The casual smile of confidence as they acknowledge that things will be what they'll be.

20
00:01:45.62 --> 00:01:56.66
But if this is the way we die, then let's do it right and honor our legacy.

21
00:01:56.66 --> 00:02:06.98
When surrounded on all sides, we faced what seemed the inevitability of death, not a man

22
00:02:06.98 --> 00:02:11.90
before you skipped a beat in their commitment.

23
00:02:11.90 --> 00:02:23.38
All are nothing, death or glory.

24
00:02:23.38 --> 00:02:34.30
And those are some excerpts from a speech by marine radar gun resargent Brian C.

25
00:02:34.30 --> 00:02:38.86
Jacqueline talking about a mission that he was on.

26
00:02:38.86 --> 00:02:46.62
And I think in that speech he did a great job of explaining the type of man that makes up the

27
00:02:46.62 --> 00:02:53.98
marine radars, which is the marine core component of special operations.

28
00:02:53.98 --> 00:02:59.06
And tonight we are lucky enough to be sitting with one of those men.

29
00:02:59.06 --> 00:03:08.82
A United States Marine, a special operations radar and a true hero, Derek Herrera.

30
00:03:08.82 --> 00:03:12.90
Welcome, man.

31
00:03:12.90 --> 00:03:13.90
Thanks for coming on.

32
00:03:13.90 --> 00:03:14.90
Thanks for having me to be here.

33
00:03:14.90 --> 00:03:16.54
It's awesome to have you on here, man.

34
00:03:16.54 --> 00:03:21.18
I know we got hooked up through some old mutual friends and I'm glad we did and I'm glad

35
00:03:21.18 --> 00:03:24.26
to sit down and be able to talk to you.

36
00:03:24.26 --> 00:03:29.90
Here's a little bit about you and your life and everything that you've done.

37
00:03:29.90 --> 00:03:34.70
As usual, let's start in a little rock arc and saw.

38
00:03:34.70 --> 00:03:35.70
Sounds good.

39
00:03:35.70 --> 00:03:37.90
Where's your born, right?

40
00:03:37.90 --> 00:03:39.90
I was born in Litterock, Arkansas.

41
00:03:39.90 --> 00:03:43.18
What was the family doing in Litterock, Arkansas?

42
00:03:43.18 --> 00:03:46.66
My father was pilot in the Air Force.

43
00:03:46.66 --> 00:03:51.54
So he was stationed there and I was born there in 1984.

44
00:03:51.54 --> 00:03:53.30
And then how long were you guys moving around all the time?

45
00:03:53.30 --> 00:03:54.30
Typical military family?

46
00:03:54.30 --> 00:03:56.30
Yes, absolutely.

47
00:03:56.30 --> 00:03:59.42
So moved about every two or three years.

48
00:03:59.42 --> 00:04:01.98
So lived in Arkansas for about two years.

49
00:04:01.98 --> 00:04:08.78
moved to Illinois, I think, for a year or two and then Honduras for an overseas assignment

50
00:04:08.78 --> 00:04:12.50
to go see all the Honduras in the late 80s, which was pretty interesting.

51
00:04:12.50 --> 00:04:14.14
Do you speak Spanish then?

52
00:04:14.14 --> 00:04:15.14
No.

53
00:04:15.14 --> 00:04:20.90
I did for a while and then tried to replace it with Arabic and then Pashto.

54
00:04:20.90 --> 00:04:23.42
I learned that it's not one of my gifts.

55
00:04:23.42 --> 00:04:25.74
Let's just go away and then get a tarp.

56
00:04:25.74 --> 00:04:26.74
Exactly.

57
00:04:26.74 --> 00:04:29.78
So no one have to be tactically conversant.

58
00:04:29.78 --> 00:04:36.10
But no, so live there for a few years and then my dad moved to Dover, Delaware, where

59
00:04:36.10 --> 00:04:37.50
I was stationed at Dover Air Force Base.

60
00:04:37.50 --> 00:04:43.42
He was a C-130 and C-5 pilot and continued to bounce around, but at that time, elementary

61
00:04:43.42 --> 00:04:44.78
school, my parents had divorced.

62
00:04:44.78 --> 00:04:48.42
So my family still lives in Delaware today.

63
00:04:48.42 --> 00:04:51.86
Also the opportunity to live in Colorado and a few other places.

64
00:04:51.86 --> 00:04:57.46
At what age were you and you got sort of like the military bug in your head?

65
00:04:57.46 --> 00:04:59.06
It was always a family business.

66
00:04:59.06 --> 00:05:04.78
So my grandfathers were both near force for 25 years and 28 years, respectively, they were

67
00:05:04.78 --> 00:05:08.06
enlisted in the Air Force.

68
00:05:08.06 --> 00:05:11.30
And my father was an Air Force for 22 years in active duty.

69
00:05:11.30 --> 00:05:13.86
How did you get knocked it by the Air Force bug?

70
00:05:13.86 --> 00:05:14.86
It was interesting.

71
00:05:14.86 --> 00:05:17.42
So go through high school.

72
00:05:17.42 --> 00:05:22.18
I'd always never wanted to serve in the military and started to get interested in the

73
00:05:22.18 --> 00:05:24.50
surface academy option as well.

74
00:05:24.50 --> 00:05:27.50
So when I lived in Colorado, actually, I was, I moved my dad when he was stationed

75
00:05:27.50 --> 00:05:29.50
at the Air Force Academy.

76
00:05:29.50 --> 00:05:32.34
So I moved on the Air Force Academy when I was there for seven to eighth grade.

77
00:05:32.34 --> 00:05:36.90
And just always was drawn to that line of work.

78
00:05:36.90 --> 00:05:41.58
And, does that Air Force Academy is, that's a nice environment.

79
00:05:41.58 --> 00:05:43.58
It's a really nice environment.

80
00:05:43.58 --> 00:05:44.58
It's beautiful, beautiful.

81
00:05:44.58 --> 00:05:46.58
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:05:46.58 --> 00:05:51.50
And your dad was working there and that it seemed, it was not, I mean, when you say

83
00:05:51.50 --> 00:05:55.30
you were thinking about the military academies, were you thinking of the Air Force

84
00:05:55.30 --> 00:05:58.30
Academy as your primary or no.

85
00:05:58.30 --> 00:06:02.94
So after that experience, in ninth grade, I moved back and lived with my mom in high

86
00:06:02.94 --> 00:06:04.74
school in Delaware.

87
00:06:04.74 --> 00:06:12.10
And my senior year of high school had been playing lacrosse up at that point and had

88
00:06:12.10 --> 00:06:16.82
the opportunity to go and play for Navy or try to walk on at least and had decent

89
00:06:16.82 --> 00:06:18.42
relationship with the coaches there.

90
00:06:18.42 --> 00:06:21.06
And so I was a plane in Navy and Air Force.

91
00:06:21.06 --> 00:06:24.82
And also wanted to be a Navy SEAL actually.

92
00:06:24.82 --> 00:06:27.66
And so at that time, I wanted to go to Naval Academy.

93
00:06:27.66 --> 00:06:32.22
And so soon as I got in and got accepted there, stopped to plan other places and just

94
00:06:32.22 --> 00:06:33.22
decided to go there.

95
00:06:33.22 --> 00:06:34.22
Right on.

96
00:06:34.22 --> 00:06:37.22
Did you visit the Naval Academy?

97
00:06:37.22 --> 00:06:39.98
Do you know what was going on at the Naval Academy?

98
00:06:39.98 --> 00:06:45.14
I thought I was the only reason I asked that is because like, I mean, I know I was not

99
00:06:45.14 --> 00:06:46.14
the most squared away kid.

100
00:06:46.14 --> 00:06:47.82
I was kind of a rebellious kid.

101
00:06:47.82 --> 00:06:51.04
And even though I loved the military, I think if I would have

102
00:06:51.04 --> 00:06:55.42
gone to, I went to West Point when I was a little kid and that kind of got me fired up,

103
00:06:55.42 --> 00:06:57.84
I think my dad took me to some kind of game there.

104
00:06:57.84 --> 00:07:01.000
I mean, I was really young, like maybe seven or eight or something like that.

105
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.12
But it was enough to make me go, yeah, you know, I kind of.

106
00:07:04.12 --> 00:07:07.36
But I think if I saw it when I was a little bit older, I don't know.

107
00:07:07.36 --> 00:07:11.56
I think I would have just said, like, I don't know if I can put up with all that right now.

108
00:07:11.56 --> 00:07:12.56
Yeah.

109
00:07:12.56 --> 00:07:14.20
But you did.

110
00:07:14.20 --> 00:07:16.12
You were like, I'm, I'm bringing it.

111
00:07:16.12 --> 00:07:24.04
You know, at any 17 year old young man, doesn't always have all the right motivations.

112
00:07:24.04 --> 00:07:27.92
And you know, you have all the reasons why you go to a place like that.

113
00:07:27.92 --> 00:07:33.44
And what I found after I had gone there was that those reasons change once or there.

114
00:07:33.44 --> 00:07:37.56
And so I entered in 2002, I should have left or September 11th.

115
00:07:37.56 --> 00:07:41.000
It wasn't solely out of patriotic duty and every, you know, and those sorts of things

116
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.04
it was because, you know, I'd already got in, I'd wanted to play the cross there.

117
00:07:46.04 --> 00:07:53.52
I was in love with my school sweetheart from Delaware who's now still my wife of almost 13 years.

118
00:07:53.52 --> 00:07:57.12
And so those were the reasons why I initially decided to go to that point.

119
00:07:57.12 --> 00:07:59.52
How did you have in your high school sweetheart?

120
00:07:59.52 --> 00:08:01.36
How did that plan to go into the Naval Academy?

121
00:08:01.36 --> 00:08:02.76
Because you would be close by?

122
00:08:02.76 --> 00:08:04.44
Yeah, it was about an hour drive away on it.

123
00:08:04.44 --> 00:08:09.24
So she could come and see me on the weekend and kind of stuff.

124
00:08:09.24 --> 00:08:11.000
And so those were some of the initial reasons why I went there.

125
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.44
In addition, all the patriotic reasons as well.

126
00:08:13.44 --> 00:08:19.80
But what I found when I was there and your challenge and your tested is those smaller,

127
00:08:19.80 --> 00:08:21.72
superficial motivators often fade away.

128
00:08:21.72 --> 00:08:22.72
Right?

129
00:08:22.72 --> 00:08:26.76
And what you left with is those reasons why I initially went here aren't going to continue

130
00:08:26.76 --> 00:08:29.28
to put me through the rest of this trial.

131
00:08:29.28 --> 00:08:30.28
Right?

132
00:08:30.28 --> 00:08:36.36
And so the motivation and the things that I learned from there at that point was the seniors

133
00:08:36.36 --> 00:08:41.68
that we had watched and we're led by who had just graduated.

134
00:08:41.68 --> 00:08:44.20
We're literally going forward and leading,

135
00:08:44.20 --> 00:08:46.40
Marines and sailors in battle.

136
00:08:46.40 --> 00:08:50.92
And we literally watched that on television with the invasion of Iraq and the things

137
00:08:50.92 --> 00:08:56.76
going on in Afghanistan and really bought into the entire leadership philosophy and wanted

138
00:08:56.76 --> 00:08:59.28
to be a part of that and wanted to be that and follow that example.

139
00:08:59.28 --> 00:09:03.56
So those were the reasons why I tried to stay and continue to move forward and become

140
00:09:03.56 --> 00:09:05.56
a military officer.

141
00:09:05.56 --> 00:09:12.56
I was, I've been like apologizing to people because there's actually been a pretty decent

142
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:17.92
number of people that have joined the military because of listening to all of us and the

143
00:09:17.92 --> 00:09:21.12
guys that bring on here talk about their experiences and they just think that sounds

144
00:09:21.12 --> 00:09:22.12
pretty cool.

145
00:09:22.12 --> 00:09:25.52
And I always say, hey, just don't be mad at me.

146
00:09:25.52 --> 00:09:28.80
Like the first two weeks that you're going through boot camp or whatever, don't be mad

147
00:09:28.80 --> 00:09:33.20
because it's just like, it's going to be a shock to your system when you lose all that

148
00:09:33.20 --> 00:09:35.60
freedom that you've had.

149
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:39.84
But I totally agree with you in the fact that once you get through that initial shock

150
00:09:39.84 --> 00:09:43.44
and you realize that there's a long-term thing going on here and you want to be a part

151
00:09:43.44 --> 00:09:47.04
of it, that's, yeah, that's, that's awesome.

152
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:50.64
And especially for you guys that came in after September 11th because that's it, that's

153
00:09:50.64 --> 00:09:56.56
a, I don't know if people can appreciate that what the difference is between the pre-September

154
00:09:56.56 --> 00:09:58.16
11th and post September 11th.

155
00:09:58.16 --> 00:10:03.04
I mean, pre-September 11th, there was almost, in fact, my first

156
00:10:03.04 --> 00:10:08.96
deployment to Iraq, my seal-platoon had zero combat experience, zero, zero.

157
00:10:08.96 --> 00:10:11.68
So no one had any combat experience at all.

158
00:10:11.68 --> 00:10:16.96
The most things that anyone had done at that point was doing ship boardings in the Persian

159
00:10:16.96 --> 00:10:19.000
Gulf, which is not combat experience.

160
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.12
It's just a, it's just a, a fairly administrative operation.

161
00:10:24.12 --> 00:10:29.72
And now every single guy, every single guy in the seal teams has combat experience, every

162
00:10:29.72 --> 00:10:30.72
single guy.

163
00:10:30.72 --> 00:10:35.84
Well, I mean, boring, maybe a few outliers, but basically every single guy, you know,

164
00:10:35.84 --> 00:10:37.76
the Marine Corps, look at the Marine Corps right now.

165
00:10:37.76 --> 00:10:44.80
I mean, it's been, it's been what 17 years of fighting and the combat experience is just so

166
00:10:44.80 --> 00:10:52.40
incredible compared to prior to September 11th, which it was totally rare to have somebody

167
00:10:52.40 --> 00:10:56.48
at a seal team that was in the first Gulf War that was in one of the three pletunes that

168
00:10:56.48 --> 00:10:57.76
got to do something.

169
00:10:57.76 --> 00:11:01.72
And what they did, you know, God bless them, they were doing their duty, but it wasn't

170
00:11:01.72 --> 00:11:04.88
these big long sustained combat operations.

171
00:11:04.88 --> 00:11:05.88
Yeah, it's interesting.

172
00:11:05.88 --> 00:11:09.12
And I think that's something that, you know, I think about a lot today, especially when

173
00:11:09.12 --> 00:11:13.52
we talk about Millennials and everything else and they get a bad rap, but everybody knows

174
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:17.08
what they're joining the military to do, like, and some men and women run to the

175
00:11:17.08 --> 00:11:19.08
sound of the gun, and some don't.

176
00:11:19.08 --> 00:11:22.84
And so the people at the continuous stay and like, there was no question of what you're

177
00:11:22.84 --> 00:11:26.08
doing if you signed up to join the Marine Corps or the seals right?

178
00:11:26.08 --> 00:11:29.52
Then how did that selection process, you said you wanted to possibly go in the seal teams?

179
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:32.52
How did that work out that you didn't go in the seal teams?

180
00:11:32.52 --> 00:11:35.000
And that's got to be a tough decision to make.

181
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Yeah.

182
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.80
And sometimes it's made for you, right?

183
00:11:37.80 --> 00:11:42.08
So Naval Academy is a very, very humbling experience.

184
00:11:42.08 --> 00:11:47.96
And so as I came out of high school, I was kind of a very talented young athlete, and

185
00:11:47.96 --> 00:11:50.72
you know, was able to get in.

186
00:11:50.72 --> 00:11:56.60
But I was also from a small town and you know, didn't have the humility and ownership

187
00:11:56.60 --> 00:11:59.52
needed to be a part of the teams.

188
00:11:59.52 --> 00:12:03.12
And that became readily apparent, you know, I was physically capable, but just wasn't mature

189
00:12:03.12 --> 00:12:04.12
enough, honestly.

190
00:12:04.12 --> 00:12:07.28
And it was, you know, didn't have that right mindset.

191
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:11.96
So it was thoroughly humbled and then as I was kind of, you know, coming to the realization

192
00:12:11.96 --> 00:12:17.16
of what I wanted to do with my life, what now, you know, had a mentor of mine who I really

193
00:12:17.16 --> 00:12:23.20
respected, who was a Marine Ranger and said, you know, Derek, like, I can help you try to

194
00:12:23.20 --> 00:12:24.20
get in the Marine Corps.

195
00:12:24.20 --> 00:12:26.32
If you're still wanted to do that, and that's what you want to think you'd make it

196
00:12:26.32 --> 00:12:27.32
great officer.

197
00:12:27.32 --> 00:12:32.52
And, you know, the Marine Corps that you see at the Naval Academy is not what is the

198
00:12:32.52 --> 00:12:34.32
reality, right, of what the fleet does.

199
00:12:34.32 --> 00:12:38.12
Because I had a really bad taste from Marines there because all the Marines have

200
00:12:38.12 --> 00:12:39.12
our drill instructors.

201
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:41.48
And it was their job to mess with you.

202
00:12:41.48 --> 00:12:43.84
And so I was like, man, Marines are down.

203
00:12:43.84 --> 00:12:46.24
I don't want to be like that.

204
00:12:46.24 --> 00:12:49.48
But the more I got to know the reality of what it was like in the fleet and what real

205
00:12:49.48 --> 00:12:52.76
Marines were doing, decided to pursue it and absolutely loved it.

206
00:12:52.76 --> 00:12:53.76
It was the best thing for me.

207
00:12:53.76 --> 00:12:58.16
And did you get, so then you go from there to from the Academy, go to the basics school?

208
00:12:58.16 --> 00:12:59.16
Correct.

209
00:12:59.16 --> 00:13:00.16
Yeah, so we go to the basics school.

210
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:05.56
We go for the six months of the basics school and with every Marine officer, so every

211
00:13:05.56 --> 00:13:10.24
Marine officer has a ground there, everybody goes through that same process.

212
00:13:10.24 --> 00:13:12.52
And then during that time, there's another selection.

213
00:13:12.52 --> 00:13:19.16
So literally rank every choice you have from, you know, thanks, supply, logistics, finance,

214
00:13:19.16 --> 00:13:24.40
like one through 21, if you're a ground officer or if you're pilot, obviously you have a flight

215
00:13:24.40 --> 00:13:26.04
contract, you don't have to do that.

216
00:13:26.04 --> 00:13:30.40
But you rank it and then they do a quality spread during which you get.

217
00:13:30.40 --> 00:13:35.76
So in some cases, pre 9-11, like you said, it was really hard and competitive to become

218
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:37.40
a free officer.

219
00:13:37.40 --> 00:13:42.48
And then when we were there, it was still pretty competitive until,

220
00:13:42.48 --> 00:13:47.12
about halfway through the course, or, excuse me, like a month out from the end of the course,

221
00:13:47.12 --> 00:13:51.40
because man power came down and was like, we're standing up a new infantry regiment.

222
00:13:51.40 --> 00:13:52.40
So boom.

223
00:13:52.40 --> 00:13:53.40
Yeah.

224
00:13:53.40 --> 00:13:57.88
And so I think I would have gotten infantry regardless, but either way, got what I wanted.

225
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:01.000
It was my first choice and that's exactly what I wanted to do and before.

226
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.96
And then where did you go from there, where'd you?

227
00:14:03.96 --> 00:14:07.80
So you stay in Quanico for a three month course called Infantry Officer's course?

228
00:14:07.80 --> 00:14:08.80
Get some.

229
00:14:08.80 --> 00:14:10.80
And it's amazing.

230
00:14:10.80 --> 00:14:11.80
Yeah.

231
00:14:11.80 --> 00:14:14.56
It's just training experiences there are.

232
00:14:14.56 --> 00:14:19.56
And so you learn web and systems, you learn, you know, all different kinds of basics,

233
00:14:19.56 --> 00:14:25.20
million of tactics, everything you need to be able to lead a rifle tune in, you know,

234
00:14:25.20 --> 00:14:26.20
infantry battalion.

235
00:14:26.20 --> 00:14:31.08
Yeah, I don't know if you, yeah, you said you listen to the podcast with Jim Web on it.

236
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:35.92
And like his first of all, and so then you went to a battalion and then you started to work

237
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:36.92
up.

238
00:14:36.92 --> 00:14:37.92
Yeah.

239
00:14:37.92 --> 00:14:42.96
Some web went from that school to Vietnam and they like brought him out in the field

240
00:14:42.96 --> 00:14:45.68
and dropped him off and said, there's your platoon over there.

241
00:14:45.68 --> 00:14:49.72
The guy you're replacing is no longer with us and you're going to go take over that

242
00:14:49.72 --> 00:14:52.80
battalion and he walked up on the side of a hill and said, hey, how you doing?

243
00:14:52.80 --> 00:14:56.12
I'm Lieutenant Web and here's what we're going to do.

244
00:14:56.12 --> 00:15:00.52
And then that night they got a big firefight and he called and, you know, combined arms

245
00:15:00.52 --> 00:15:02.000
and man.

246
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.28
But that school must be must be an awesome school.

247
00:15:04.28 --> 00:15:05.28
It's pretty amazing.

248
00:15:05.28 --> 00:15:06.28
Yeah.

249
00:15:06.28 --> 00:15:07.88
And by the time we were there, we had.

250
00:15:07.88 --> 00:15:12.12
Really phenomenal leaders and instructors who were able to teach us because they were fresh

251
00:15:12.12 --> 00:15:16.24
off the battlefield in Iraq and were able to teach us exactly what we were going to do.

252
00:15:16.24 --> 00:15:20.32
And so for me, I went into a long workup prior to deploying but some of our guys were just

253
00:15:20.32 --> 00:15:21.32
like what happened to Jim Web.

254
00:15:21.32 --> 00:15:22.32
No kidding.

255
00:15:22.32 --> 00:15:27.36
They had maybe a month or meeting their platoon at their final exercise as they're stepping

256
00:15:27.36 --> 00:15:29.08
off to go to Iraq.

257
00:15:29.08 --> 00:15:30.36
And so that's no joke.

258
00:15:30.36 --> 00:15:32.60
There was, yeah, it was pretty interesting.

259
00:15:32.60 --> 00:15:37.88
So for me, you know, I ended up going to a new battalion that was standing up first battalion

260
00:15:37.88 --> 00:15:45.40
nine Marines, the walking dead and had about a year roughly to work on my platoon and

261
00:15:45.40 --> 00:15:48.60
to train before we ended up deploying to Iraq.

262
00:15:48.60 --> 00:15:52.96
And that was just a standard ground pounder in Fitchery, Platoon.

263
00:15:52.96 --> 00:15:53.96
Initially, yes.

264
00:15:53.96 --> 00:15:54.96
Yeah.

265
00:15:54.96 --> 00:16:02.12
And so we were a standard rifle platoon and then about two months before deployment.

266
00:16:02.12 --> 00:16:05.48
And so we were just on the needs of the situation in Romadi.

267
00:16:05.48 --> 00:16:12.16
We're employing to the decision was made to actually break us down into smaller training

268
00:16:12.16 --> 00:16:13.80
teams and advisory teams.

269
00:16:13.80 --> 00:16:20.76
And so my platoon of, you know, roughly 40 Marines and sailors turned into 12 mantimes,

270
00:16:20.76 --> 00:16:23.72
which I was in charge of one, a my platoon sergeant was in charge of another one.

271
00:16:23.72 --> 00:16:30.04
And so the reason they did that was because that was roughly the minimum size required to partner

272
00:16:30.04 --> 00:16:32.92
with effectively for these police stations.

273
00:16:32.92 --> 00:16:40.68
And so at that time, due to the successes of people like yourself and the other people

274
00:16:40.68 --> 00:16:45.48
that had fought in Romadi and turned the tide of the battle, we were consolidating and

275
00:16:45.48 --> 00:16:48.04
basically, you know, withdrawing a lot of the combat power.

276
00:16:48.04 --> 00:16:53.000
And so we took over for two different infantry battalions in another army unit with just

277
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
one infantry battalion.

278
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.48
So we had the entire air evocations for just one time.

279
00:17:00.48 --> 00:17:06.16
And so I had initially one police station that was partnered with, you know, as a young

280
00:17:06.16 --> 00:17:13.32
lieutenant in a 12-man team, we partnered with an Iraqi Colonel over 800 Iraqi police.

281
00:17:13.32 --> 00:17:14.32
For whereabouts were you?

282
00:17:14.32 --> 00:17:17.60
We were in a small neighborhood just south of Camp Romadi called Tamiim.

283
00:17:17.60 --> 00:17:18.60
Okay.

284
00:17:18.60 --> 00:17:19.60
To me.

285
00:17:19.60 --> 00:17:23.36
So all of Tamiim, we were managing with the police there because the police had done such a

286
00:17:23.36 --> 00:17:28.000
good job and taken over that, you know, we were in the back seat.

287
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah, most totally.

288
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.60
Just to give everyone a tooth, this is 2008, right?

289
00:17:31.60 --> 00:17:32.60
Great.

290
00:17:32.60 --> 00:17:41.56
So the major fighting kind of tapered off in in 07, I mean, early 07, they were pretty, it

291
00:17:41.56 --> 00:17:42.56
was pretty calm.

292
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:47.48
I know the guys that relieved us by the time they left, it was very calm in Romadi.

293
00:17:47.48 --> 00:17:49.48
You know, obviously there's still always going to be a threat.

294
00:17:49.48 --> 00:17:53.08
But like Tamiim, when we were there, there was, there was a lot, there was really

295
00:17:53.08 --> 00:17:58.88
bad big, gnarly IEDs into me when we were there and it was awful.

296
00:17:58.88 --> 00:18:04.16
Some of those humbese would get hit and it would just be, you know, they'd lose three, four,

297
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:05.88
five guys at a shot.

298
00:18:05.88 --> 00:18:07.52
It was horrible.

299
00:18:07.52 --> 00:18:09.40
But, you know, that's awesome.

300
00:18:09.40 --> 00:18:15.56
And that's I always trying to explain to people that, that in Romadi, we actually won.

301
00:18:15.56 --> 00:18:20.60
And you know, you're proof of that when you were over there and you guys were, I'm sure

302
00:18:20.60 --> 00:18:25.36
doing out civil affairs and, you know, that type of thing is that basically what you were

303
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:26.36
doing.

304
00:18:26.36 --> 00:18:30.96
Yeah, we were, you know, just really just trying to turn it over to the police there.

305
00:18:30.96 --> 00:18:35.48
And so got to sit on, you know, the weekly sure rows and the council meetings and hang out

306
00:18:35.48 --> 00:18:37.80
and drink tea with the current all.

307
00:18:37.80 --> 00:18:42.48
And we tried to do operations with them and everything, but they locked the place down.

308
00:18:42.48 --> 00:18:46.12
I mean, literally by the time we were there, they had, you know, triple strain concertino

309
00:18:46.12 --> 00:18:48.16
wire and checkpoints all around the entire cities.

310
00:18:48.16 --> 00:18:52.68
They were controlling the flow of, they prevented the flow of any, you know, any material

311
00:18:52.68 --> 00:18:58.32
or any fighters so that then they did such a good job that honestly, I don't think anybody

312
00:18:58.32 --> 00:18:59.72
shot us the entire deployment.

313
00:18:59.72 --> 00:19:04.76
We got a few different smaller IDs here and there at one major incident with the Vicoborn

314
00:19:04.76 --> 00:19:09.24
ID that killed a lot of our Iraqi policemen, unfortunately.

315
00:19:09.24 --> 00:19:14.28
But none of our Americans were involved or gotten injured at that time.

316
00:19:14.28 --> 00:19:20.80
But they were very well trained fighting force and, you know, they did good work.

317
00:19:20.80 --> 00:19:27.60
How was it set in the expectations for your 19-year-old Marines that were, you know, on

318
00:19:27.60 --> 00:19:30.44
deployment with you, that were expecting to go get some.

319
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:31.44
Yeah.

320
00:19:31.44 --> 00:19:32.44
That was interesting.

321
00:19:32.44 --> 00:19:37.48
So, you got to, you got to deal with the missions that you're, you're given, right?

322
00:19:37.48 --> 00:19:44.24
And so, the average 19-year-old Lance Corporal, 18-year-old Lance Corporal at that time,

323
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:47.32
you know, signed up to join to go fight.

324
00:19:47.32 --> 00:19:48.32
That wasn't our mission.

325
00:19:48.32 --> 00:19:52.96
And so, we were very cognizant of that and over the year, the work up we were well-educated

326
00:19:52.96 --> 00:19:53.96
too.

327
00:19:53.96 --> 00:19:58.72
So, we had direct comms with the teams we were turning over with over class of any male network

328
00:19:58.72 --> 00:20:01.24
and those sorts of things and we were able to find out exactly what we'd be going

329
00:20:01.24 --> 00:20:02.24
into.

330
00:20:02.24 --> 00:20:04.24
And so, we were able to manage those expectations appropriately.

331
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:05.24
Yeah.

332
00:20:05.24 --> 00:20:10.60
And because of that, we were successful, I think, our team performed well.

333
00:20:10.60 --> 00:20:12.56
You know, they were obviously frustrated at times.

334
00:20:12.56 --> 00:20:13.56
Yeah.

335
00:20:13.56 --> 00:20:20.56
No, I would have guys ask me that, you know, guys, once I was back, what I was still in,

336
00:20:20.56 --> 00:20:23.44
because you know how am I supposed to get guys fired up to do this mission when it's

337
00:20:23.44 --> 00:20:26.04
all we're going to be doing is drinking tea.

338
00:20:26.04 --> 00:20:29.40
And you know, I'd say, listen, that's still your mission.

339
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:32.04
And you have to do it to the best of your ability and get the Iraq police trained up

340
00:20:32.04 --> 00:20:34.04
as best you can.

341
00:20:34.04 --> 00:20:38.32
And like, you still have to just attack it with everything you've got regardless of

342
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:39.60
what that mission is.

343
00:20:39.60 --> 00:20:43.52
And that's, hey, man, that's what that's what the nation is calling on you to do.

344
00:20:43.52 --> 00:20:44.84
And that's what that is right there.

345
00:20:44.84 --> 00:20:46.36
And so go do it to the best of your ability.

346
00:20:46.36 --> 00:20:50.68
And that's, again, you know, that's why I asked you that question because believe me, you

347
00:20:50.68 --> 00:20:53.88
get these young kids, man, they don't want to have tea with anybody.

348
00:20:53.88 --> 00:20:55.88
No, there's one shoot they're saw.

349
00:20:55.88 --> 00:20:56.88
Yeah.

350
00:20:56.88 --> 00:20:58.88
And we're pretty fortunate.

351
00:20:58.88 --> 00:21:01.52
And we did do some interesting things as well.

352
00:21:01.52 --> 00:21:10.04
So, because we had access and placement within the neighborhood, to me, what's kind of a

353
00:21:10.04 --> 00:21:16.88
pretty tightly packed urban area and a lot of people would come and go.

354
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:22.56
And so at that time, we had great intelligence networks that would able to help us identify

355
00:21:22.56 --> 00:21:28.32
if somebody didn't belong and we were able to work with our counterparts to try to intervene

356
00:21:28.32 --> 00:21:31.80
before they were able to cause any issues.

357
00:21:31.80 --> 00:21:39.40
And so we mounted up for a few different raids, which kept the guns motivated and things.

358
00:21:39.40 --> 00:21:42.28
But it's kind of a good and bad thing, right?

359
00:21:42.28 --> 00:21:46.56
There's no fight going on in the other guards.

360
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:51.08
Good in the sense that the guys are safe and came back and were able to have a successful

361
00:21:51.08 --> 00:21:54.28
deployment and still do something really meaningful for the country.

362
00:21:54.28 --> 00:22:00.000
But not as exciting as they would have wanted because that's what the 18 year old signs

363
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.28
up to join to go do.

364
00:22:01.28 --> 00:22:02.68
Yeah, volunteers to do.

365
00:22:02.68 --> 00:22:03.68
Yeah.

366
00:22:03.68 --> 00:22:09.08
I don't think too many guys walking that recruiters office thinking about police

367
00:22:09.08 --> 00:22:11.32
actions or anything like that.

368
00:22:11.32 --> 00:22:14.04
But you have to set their expectations correctly.

369
00:22:14.04 --> 00:22:16.48
And it sounds like you were able to do that.

370
00:22:16.48 --> 00:22:21.44
Now, when you came home from that deployment, you deployed again.

371
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:25.68
But it was even more on the humanitarian side.

372
00:22:25.68 --> 00:22:26.68
So what was that like?

373
00:22:26.68 --> 00:22:27.68
Tell us about that one.

374
00:22:27.68 --> 00:22:28.68
I was tough too.

375
00:22:28.68 --> 00:22:32.40
So before I had actually deployed again when I came back, I had such a good experience

376
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:35.000
and learned about Marsak at that time.

377
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.48
The Marine Special Operations Command that did selection in between those two deployments.

378
00:22:40.48 --> 00:22:41.96
Oh, I'm just selected.

379
00:22:41.96 --> 00:22:46.44
And so at that time the criteria to get into Marsak was you had to do two deployments.

380
00:22:46.44 --> 00:22:49.56
And so had to go back and train and then deploy again.

381
00:22:49.56 --> 00:22:50.56
So wait.

382
00:22:50.56 --> 00:22:55.92
So the selection like Buds for Marsak is that what it is?

383
00:22:55.92 --> 00:22:56.92
Kind of.

384
00:22:56.92 --> 00:23:00.52
We follow more of a Greenbrake Army model.

385
00:23:00.52 --> 00:23:06.24
So it's modeled very, very similarly to the Special Forces Assessment Selection process.

386
00:23:06.24 --> 00:23:08.44
So how long is the training?

387
00:23:08.44 --> 00:23:10.44
It's about six weeks.

388
00:23:10.44 --> 00:23:16.84
And so you go there and you do the basic tasks associated with selection including

389
00:23:16.84 --> 00:23:21.80
you know, hiking a lot and land now of in psychological screening.

390
00:23:21.80 --> 00:23:25.20
So is it more of a weeding out or are they actually training you for anything?

391
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:29.08
Yeah, there's no, I wouldn't say there's really much of training.

392
00:23:29.08 --> 00:23:33.08
It's a lot of critical thinking and problem solving and very similar to the S-Fast as far

393
00:23:33.08 --> 00:23:38.44
as like, you know, here's problem set, ethical problem set, physical problem set, teamwork

394
00:23:38.44 --> 00:23:40.76
and you're continually being evaluated.

395
00:23:40.76 --> 00:23:46.80
But that's just a basic evaluation to just get the shot at going to like, you know,

396
00:23:46.80 --> 00:23:48.000
go into our training course.

397
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.52
And so then we have a seven month long.

398
00:23:49.52 --> 00:23:50.52
Okay, I got it.

399
00:23:50.52 --> 00:23:54.48
So this is the first thing we go through is just selection to see if you're going to be

400
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:57.52
able to go through the real course.

401
00:23:57.52 --> 00:23:58.52
Yeah.

402
00:23:58.52 --> 00:23:59.52
Okay, got it.

403
00:23:59.52 --> 00:24:00.52
Yeah.

404
00:24:00.52 --> 00:24:01.52
Yeah, Buds doesn't do that.

405
00:24:01.52 --> 00:24:05.52
You just show up there and that's one of the reasons the interest in rates so high

406
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:08.40
maybe if we had them pre- and actually I take that back.

407
00:24:08.40 --> 00:24:14.24
Now they do have like a pre you go to like a pre Buds and you get prepared for it and

408
00:24:14.24 --> 00:24:15.24
all that.

409
00:24:15.24 --> 00:24:18.68
But so you go to that selection and you get picked up.

410
00:24:18.68 --> 00:24:20.76
So you go through that thing and they pick you up.

411
00:24:20.76 --> 00:24:22.32
But then you haven't done two deployments.

412
00:24:22.32 --> 00:24:24.08
They go, no, you still gotta go into deployment again.

413
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:25.08
Yeah.

414
00:24:25.08 --> 00:24:27.76
And that deployment ends up being a humanitarian deployment.

415
00:24:27.76 --> 00:24:29.68
So the most part, yeah, definitely.

416
00:24:29.68 --> 00:24:34.000
So we did what was called the Marine Expeditionary Unit.

417
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.20
And so on the Marine Expeditionary Unit, there are Marines and Parked aboard Naval Vessels.

418
00:24:41.20 --> 00:24:43.76
And so there's a battalion, if you battalion.

419
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:44.76
Yeah.

420
00:24:44.76 --> 00:24:49.92
I did two new armed deployments back in the day.

421
00:24:49.92 --> 00:24:53.24
So I was out there with all the boys getting after it.

422
00:24:53.24 --> 00:24:57.32
That's how I developed a bunch of, you know, I have a bunch of friends that were in the Marine

423
00:24:57.32 --> 00:25:02.20
Corps in recon and force recon from that time from doing our deployments.

424
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:05.36
So yeah, we, we got our ship board time.

425
00:25:05.36 --> 00:25:08.52
We used to see if we don't go, don't really do that too much anymore.

426
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:13.20
But no, no, and yeah, and I think that's a good thing.

427
00:25:13.20 --> 00:25:14.20
It was tough.

428
00:25:14.20 --> 00:25:15.20
That was pretty tough.

429
00:25:15.20 --> 00:25:18.04
You know, it's a talk about motivating your team to say motivated through seven

430
00:25:18.04 --> 00:25:20.92
months of shaking hands and drinking tea in Iraq.

431
00:25:20.92 --> 00:25:27.04
And now it's, hey, stay ready and just train on a ship where, yeah, you have no

432
00:25:27.04 --> 00:25:28.04
room.

433
00:25:28.04 --> 00:25:31.12
You don't have any real ability to train the gym holds six people and there's three

434
00:25:31.12 --> 00:25:36.28
treadmills and you can't get on the flight deck for, you know, two hours a day.

435
00:25:36.28 --> 00:25:37.28
What kind of ship were you on?

436
00:25:37.28 --> 00:25:41.28
So I was on the LPD 19.

437
00:25:41.28 --> 00:25:42.28
I was amazing.

438
00:25:42.28 --> 00:25:43.92
I was a nice, it was newer ship.

439
00:25:43.92 --> 00:25:44.92
So it was nice.

440
00:25:44.92 --> 00:25:47.56
And it was good because we were on the, it was a smaller ship.

441
00:25:47.56 --> 00:25:52.96
So we were on the major, you know, the big flat top with the command and so.

442
00:25:52.96 --> 00:25:53.96
So it was pretty good.

443
00:25:53.96 --> 00:25:57.68
And I had a great deployment because I was a company executive officer.

444
00:25:57.68 --> 00:26:01.96
And so I got to spend very little time on the ship, which is a lot of fun because I had

445
00:26:01.96 --> 00:26:04.36
to go and plan all the training.

446
00:26:04.36 --> 00:26:09.84
And so, you know, we were bouncing around doing different bilateral training missions with

447
00:26:09.84 --> 00:26:18.32
Israel, Jordan, Oman, training Kuwait, had some liberty time and cutter, barraine.

448
00:26:18.32 --> 00:26:20.20
All of the peaceful countries are really sad.

449
00:26:20.20 --> 00:26:23.84
So it was, it was a really good experience.

450
00:26:23.84 --> 00:26:27.08
But, you know, on the Marines hate it because they were stuck on the ship.

451
00:26:27.08 --> 00:26:30.72
They didn't have the luxury that I did to go and get off the ship and train.

452
00:26:30.72 --> 00:26:33.64
And so it was a, it was an interesting deployment.

453
00:26:33.64 --> 00:26:36.76
Yeah, those ship board deployments are very interesting.

454
00:26:36.76 --> 00:26:39.12
They were like, we would do the really dumb stuff.

455
00:26:39.12 --> 00:26:43.08
First of all, when I was on ship board deployment, there was no internet.

456
00:26:43.08 --> 00:26:44.08
There was nothing.

457
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:45.56
So we, we was mainly, yeah.

458
00:26:45.56 --> 00:26:47.56
And I mean, we were just dumb.

459
00:26:47.56 --> 00:26:51.48
And so we would watch, we had, you know, a big box full of video tapes.

460
00:26:51.48 --> 00:26:52.48
You know what those are?

461
00:26:52.48 --> 00:26:53.48
Yeah.

462
00:26:53.48 --> 00:26:59.56
Because sets, because there was no, whatever, streaming Netflix.

463
00:26:59.56 --> 00:27:05.40
So we just had like, out of the way, probably watch 20 movies, 5,000 times each.

464
00:27:05.40 --> 00:27:09.48
So that era of movies, I'm very familiar with.

465
00:27:09.48 --> 00:27:13.24
But, but yeah, and then it was like, you know, the big joke about seals is when your

466
00:27:13.24 --> 00:27:14.80
on a ship is sleep eating left.

467
00:27:14.80 --> 00:27:15.80
That's what it stands for.

468
00:27:15.80 --> 00:27:18.80
It's sleep eating left because that's all there is to do.

469
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:24.04
But we would, we would pt every day out on the flight deck or somewhere on the ship.

470
00:27:24.04 --> 00:27:27.84
And then we would try and set up where we'd go shoot, skit.

471
00:27:27.84 --> 00:27:30.56
We brought pallets and pallets worth of skit.

472
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:34.80
So we'd go on the back, the fan tell the ship and throw skit and shoot it.

473
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:40.68
Or we'd sit out there with grenade launchers and launch grenades at the trash yesterday.

474
00:27:40.68 --> 00:27:42.92
So we tried to make it fun, you know.

475
00:27:42.92 --> 00:27:46.68
But still, there's 24 hours in a day.

476
00:27:46.68 --> 00:27:49.28
And if there's not a lot to do on a ship, yeah.

477
00:27:49.28 --> 00:27:51.96
So it's very, pretty boring.

478
00:27:51.96 --> 00:27:58.28
And yeah, and for all the listeners too, that was the reality, pre 9-11 before the world

479
00:27:58.28 --> 00:27:59.28
used to belong.

480
00:27:59.28 --> 00:28:03.20
That was, you know, you were just, so the mission for the mute was just to be prepared

481
00:28:03.20 --> 00:28:06.24
in a crisis, there's crisis response force essentially.

482
00:28:06.24 --> 00:28:12.96
And so for us, we actually had the opportunity to do one real world mission responding to

483
00:28:12.96 --> 00:28:17.92
the earthquake in Haiti, which was, like you said, a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

484
00:28:17.92 --> 00:28:23.20
And so right off the bat, as we were getting underway, that had happened a couple of weeks

485
00:28:23.20 --> 00:28:24.36
before we were scheduled to deploy.

486
00:28:24.36 --> 00:28:29.60
So we got on and went down and were able to get involved and help out.

487
00:28:29.60 --> 00:28:32.84
And so it was flew in with the company Marines.

488
00:28:32.84 --> 00:28:37.28
And our company was tasked with just helping provide an established security for a forward

489
00:28:37.28 --> 00:28:42.92
staging base, so logistics area for some of the food and water that they were distributing.

490
00:28:42.92 --> 00:28:45.84
So how bad was it down there?

491
00:28:45.84 --> 00:28:46.84
Pretty terrible.

492
00:28:46.84 --> 00:28:50.60
It was really, really bad.

493
00:28:50.60 --> 00:28:56.000
We were flew in on a helicopter into the giant dirt field, which, you know, we were

494
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.84
bouncing CYR and, you know, setting up fire plants, catches and everything, just to get,

495
00:29:00.84 --> 00:29:02.36
you know, everything squared away.

496
00:29:02.36 --> 00:29:06.60
But the level of poverty was pretty striking for us.

497
00:29:06.60 --> 00:29:11.000
I mean, we had Marine stand-up post and setting guard and everything.

498
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.48
You know, you see, forehomeless kids between the age eight and 12, sleeping with, you know,

499
00:29:17.48 --> 00:29:21.36
everything they own and they're sharing one blanket outside the wire, just hanging out.

500
00:29:21.36 --> 00:29:27.60
You know, we see like a fist fight, a knockout, drag down fist fight between two girls

501
00:29:27.60 --> 00:29:33.88
that are age, whatever, 12 and 14 over a piece of wood, because firewood is like gold there

502
00:29:33.88 --> 00:29:36.36
because they just don't have wood.

503
00:29:36.36 --> 00:29:41.60
And so that was really, really eye-opening experience for us.

504
00:29:41.60 --> 00:29:42.60
And so what were you guys doing?

505
00:29:42.60 --> 00:29:44.56
Were you guys bringing water, were you bringing medical care?

506
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:45.60
What were you doing?

507
00:29:45.60 --> 00:29:50.60
So the UN was administering all the food and water and so they basically dropped us off.

508
00:29:50.60 --> 00:29:55.72
And typical Marine Corps fashion, they said, you know, pack light, you'll only be in there

509
00:29:55.72 --> 00:29:57.84
for 24 hours before we leave you.

510
00:29:57.84 --> 00:30:02.12
And then as we get on the bar, they're like, okay, it might be like 48 and by the time we

511
00:30:02.12 --> 00:30:04.32
land, they're like, we're not sure what you're getting out.

512
00:30:04.32 --> 00:30:07.76
So it's going to stay in for about nine days.

513
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:10.96
And you know, I had a big bar on steel, things there.

514
00:30:10.96 --> 00:30:18.04
But our job was just to literally make sure that overnight, they could drop off 60 shipping

515
00:30:18.04 --> 00:30:22.36
trailers, ISO containers of food and water and that people weren't going to.

516
00:30:22.36 --> 00:30:24.76
Who distributed the food and water?

517
00:30:24.76 --> 00:30:26.60
It was primarily the UN force there.

518
00:30:26.60 --> 00:30:31.32
So I think at that time it was a lot of, I think it was the primary Brazilian force.

519
00:30:31.32 --> 00:30:34.52
So they would come in in the morning and it was low to up and go and distribute it.

520
00:30:34.52 --> 00:30:38.80
And I know that was different for a lot of other places, but for us that was the mission

521
00:30:38.80 --> 00:30:41.80
that we had and that was the kind of the way it worked.

522
00:30:41.80 --> 00:30:46.48
So it was just a very short temporary stand and got back on the ships and steamed across

523
00:30:46.48 --> 00:30:48.48
the Atlantic.

524
00:30:48.48 --> 00:30:52.76
And then, and then hit all a bunch of exercises and whatnot like you said over in the Gulf.

525
00:30:52.76 --> 00:30:53.76
Yeah.

526
00:30:53.76 --> 00:31:00.000
So unfortunately, we didn't get to do the exercise we'd planned for Israel because we're

527
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.40
in Haiti instead.

528
00:31:01.40 --> 00:31:04.64
So we went straight to think of as Jordan.

529
00:31:04.64 --> 00:31:10.60
We did an infinite moonlight, I think at that time, and we're able to do some basic patrolling

530
00:31:10.60 --> 00:31:11.60
with Jordan and soldiers.

531
00:31:11.60 --> 00:31:16.80
That was kind of cool actually because not always Jordan just an amazing country to be in.

532
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:21.20
But those people that we're training with were some of the same units that were going

533
00:31:21.20 --> 00:31:23.36
to fight in Afghanistan.

534
00:31:23.36 --> 00:31:29.12
And so the Jordanians provided a good contingent of forces to go forward in Afghanistan.

535
00:31:29.12 --> 00:31:30.12
And so that was fun.

536
00:31:30.12 --> 00:31:33.36
I'm getting to work with those guys and they're training with those guys.

537
00:31:33.36 --> 00:31:41.80
And then we trained with Omanee soldiers and that was pretty interesting as well.

538
00:31:41.80 --> 00:31:46.88
The thing we learned which was really interesting was actual Omanee.

539
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:49.28
There's not really small population.

540
00:31:49.28 --> 00:31:55.76
So they have at least the units that we were working with had some conscripts from Pakistan,

541
00:31:55.76 --> 00:31:58.12
essentially, Ballut just in.

542
00:31:58.12 --> 00:32:03.32
So the officers spoke Arabic and they were Omanee, but the rest of the Paltoon was

543
00:32:03.32 --> 00:32:04.32
all Ballutchi.

544
00:32:04.32 --> 00:32:08.36
And spoke Ballutchi.

545
00:32:08.36 --> 00:32:10.68
And so I was kind of interesting to see how that worked.

546
00:32:10.68 --> 00:32:13.84
But very capable of force at a good time.

547
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:14.84
No, okay.

548
00:32:14.84 --> 00:32:15.84
And fight with those guys.

549
00:32:15.84 --> 00:32:18.64
And so yeah, modern day conscripts.

550
00:32:18.64 --> 00:32:20.68
Yeah, and I mean they all volunteer.

551
00:32:20.68 --> 00:32:23.68
I mean they, I guess technically concert might not be the right word.

552
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:24.84
They all volunteered to be there.

553
00:32:24.84 --> 00:32:26.52
And so we talked to Europe at Tune Sergeant.

554
00:32:26.52 --> 00:32:28.08
He's like, hey, so it's like a wave in here.

555
00:32:28.08 --> 00:32:30.92
And everybody and get a better life for themselves.

556
00:32:30.92 --> 00:32:33.92
So he's like, hey, the deal is I've been here for 20 years.

557
00:32:33.92 --> 00:32:34.72
I loved him this job.

558
00:32:34.72 --> 00:32:36.04
And I will send money on back to my family.

559
00:32:36.04 --> 00:32:38.64
And if I make it to 30, they'll let me bring my family over here.

560
00:32:38.64 --> 00:32:41.40
So you can see his family in 20 years.

561
00:32:41.40 --> 00:32:46.08
But he's trying to better their life by going forward to live and fight for another

562
00:32:46.08 --> 00:32:47.08
country.

563
00:32:47.08 --> 00:32:48.08
Yeah.

564
00:32:48.08 --> 00:32:49.64
You can't fault him for that.

565
00:32:49.64 --> 00:32:52.12
Like that's a good way one orbit.

566
00:32:52.12 --> 00:32:53.12
All right.

567
00:32:53.12 --> 00:32:54.64
So you get home, you get home from that deployment.

568
00:32:54.64 --> 00:32:58.04
And now it's time to go to what's the long course of.

569
00:32:58.04 --> 00:32:59.04
Mar-Sock.

570
00:32:59.04 --> 00:33:00.04
What's that course called?

571
00:33:00.04 --> 00:33:02.32
It's called individual training course.

572
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:08.12
And so it is pretty similar to other special forces training courses.

573
00:33:08.12 --> 00:33:09.12
So where is it?

574
00:33:09.12 --> 00:33:12.44
It's in Northern North Carolina or in Camp Lugion.

575
00:33:12.44 --> 00:33:15.48
And so we have a small portion of the base there.

576
00:33:15.48 --> 00:33:19.04
Now we're established a pretty sizable compound.

577
00:33:19.04 --> 00:33:25.44
And so I'd say by 80 to 90% of the marine special operations command is headquartered there.

578
00:33:25.44 --> 00:33:28.88
And then they have a small let's go to the contingent out here at Camp Penelton.

579
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:31.44
And so the entire schoolhouse is there.

580
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:33.88
And that's where every operator goes through training.

581
00:33:33.88 --> 00:33:35.44
And how long is that course?

582
00:33:35.44 --> 00:33:36.44
It's about 78 months.

583
00:33:36.44 --> 00:33:39.000
And what are you doing in that course?

584
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.36
So that is, of course, that encompasses all of the basic fundamentals required to join

585
00:33:44.36 --> 00:33:45.44
a team and to be an operator.

586
00:33:45.44 --> 00:33:51.32
So we do the first phase is some physical training.

587
00:33:51.32 --> 00:33:54.32
You do some basic fire support, some medical training.

588
00:33:54.32 --> 00:33:58.96
You do your sear, your full spectrum sear, training there.

589
00:33:58.96 --> 00:34:04.48
And then you move into some basic SR and patrol and special reconnaissance and basic, you know,

590
00:34:04.48 --> 00:34:06.20
reconnaissance skills.

591
00:34:06.20 --> 00:34:08.96
Are guys this so this isn't really a selection course then?

592
00:34:08.96 --> 00:34:11.04
I mean, no this is a training course.

593
00:34:11.04 --> 00:34:14.04
But like, but it's pretty high stakes to and guys are quitting.

594
00:34:14.04 --> 00:34:15.04
Oh, so guys quit.

595
00:34:15.04 --> 00:34:16.24
Yeah, I plan to guys quit.

596
00:34:16.24 --> 00:34:17.24
Really.

597
00:34:17.24 --> 00:34:18.24
It's not easy.

598
00:34:18.24 --> 00:34:19.24
Yeah.

599
00:34:19.24 --> 00:34:24.24
So we kind of, it's just the way, you know, it just seems like if someone was

600
00:34:24.24 --> 00:34:28.92
a Marine already and then they made it through that first course and now they show up at this

601
00:34:28.92 --> 00:34:33.20
course, it seems like that's, that's a lot of hoops to jump through to get to there and

602
00:34:33.20 --> 00:34:34.20
then quit.

603
00:34:34.20 --> 00:34:36.36
That seems kind of, a little bit crazy.

604
00:34:36.36 --> 00:34:37.36
Yeah.

605
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:40.84
Yeah, we'll get some stronger than, uh, they, uh, they push this.

606
00:34:40.84 --> 00:34:41.84
All right, they're trying to break this.

607
00:34:41.84 --> 00:34:42.84
What are they doing?

608
00:34:42.84 --> 00:34:45.32
What is it like the same as it like the Buds type stuff?

609
00:34:45.32 --> 00:34:47.84
Be called, be wet, be tired, be measurable, no sleep.

610
00:34:47.84 --> 00:34:48.84
It's just against all that.

611
00:34:48.84 --> 00:34:49.84
Yeah.

612
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:50.84
For the most part.

613
00:34:50.84 --> 00:34:54.96
And kind of, it makes a Buds and SKT probably mixed together.

614
00:34:54.96 --> 00:35:00.44
And so, um, one of the things that they are able to do within Marsak is to try to take

615
00:35:00.44 --> 00:35:04.52
lessons learned and invest practices from all of the other services.

616
00:35:04.52 --> 00:35:11.20
And so whether it was, you know, the Q course or Buds or SKT or OTC or anything else,

617
00:35:11.20 --> 00:35:16.000
then structures kind of looked at what was going on in other courses and looked at the

618
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.60
requirement for marine raiders coming out the backside.

619
00:35:20.60 --> 00:35:22.16
There's some of those guys who are graduating.

620
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:26.88
We had guys deploy within a month or two later on Hot Fill's help to go to Brits.

621
00:35:26.88 --> 00:35:30.76
So do they, do they put you through like another like crucible type scenario?

622
00:35:30.76 --> 00:35:31.76
Yeah.

623
00:35:31.76 --> 00:35:34.88
So we kind of mix, uh, it's called Raider Spirit.

624
00:35:34.88 --> 00:35:36.68
And, well, that sounds real fun.

625
00:35:36.68 --> 00:35:37.68
Yeah.

626
00:35:37.68 --> 00:35:40.24
That's one of those things that could get you with a little bit of that Raider Spirit

627
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:41.40
to come and get some.

628
00:35:41.40 --> 00:35:42.40
Yeah.

629
00:35:42.40 --> 00:35:43.40
Yeah.

630
00:35:43.40 --> 00:35:47.48
And it's, uh, a varying length dependent upon the class and the size and the performance.

631
00:35:47.48 --> 00:35:55.44
But at that point, you're trained in your amphib package, you're basic small boat handling,

632
00:35:55.44 --> 00:35:59.84
you're trained in, you know, basic reconnaissance and in those principles, all your

633
00:35:59.84 --> 00:36:00.96
comms and everything else.

634
00:36:00.96 --> 00:36:06.76
So it's basically a full foot, full mission profile for, you know, including an amphibious

635
00:36:06.76 --> 00:36:11.20
insert, which for us was, I think like January, get some maybe.

636
00:36:11.20 --> 00:36:17.000
And so, uh, and then same thing, you know, limited sleeve limited water, limited food, type

637
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
thing.

638
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
So pretty, uh, intense.

639
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Yeah.

640
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Yeah.

641
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Yeah.

642
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.64
It just seems like a super, uh, little bit of the Marine Corps square away.

643
00:36:25.64 --> 00:36:30.24
And that's, this whole thing sounds like a square away, way to do this.

644
00:36:30.24 --> 00:36:36.36
Because if you look at buds, you don't even have real guns, most of buds.

645
00:36:36.36 --> 00:36:37.96
You don't even have rifles.

646
00:36:37.96 --> 00:36:41.000
You're carrying, you're literally carrying a boat paddle.

647
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.44
They kind of make that your weapon, because you can't lose it.

648
00:36:43.44 --> 00:36:44.60
You can't put it down all this stuff.

649
00:36:44.60 --> 00:36:47.20
But it's a boat paddle.

650
00:36:47.20 --> 00:36:54.04
I mean, you're just, you're so, you're just so young and untrained, you know, you just

651
00:36:54.04 --> 00:36:55.52
have no skills.

652
00:36:55.52 --> 00:36:58.88
And so there's no, it's just, and they teach, you know, when you get to land more

653
00:36:58.88 --> 00:37:05.56
free, teach, you learn some basic time, but the diving that you learn is just so, so,

654
00:37:05.56 --> 00:37:09.96
just, just easy, like looking back on it's just the easiest possible things you could

655
00:37:09.96 --> 00:37:12.000
possibly do diving.

656
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.68
And the same thing with the land warfare, pieces.

657
00:37:14.68 --> 00:37:16.76
Like they're telling you, hey, walk this far.

658
00:37:16.76 --> 00:37:18.96
And like they're telling you exactly where to go.

659
00:37:18.96 --> 00:37:23.44
It's not even, it's barely, you do land now, but it's barely land now.

660
00:37:23.44 --> 00:37:28.32
And it's, and it's good, because, you know, it weeds out a lot of people.

661
00:37:28.32 --> 00:37:30.92
But then you have to go through, like you said, SKT, which comes afterwards, and that's where

662
00:37:30.92 --> 00:37:31.92
you start learning.

663
00:37:31.92 --> 00:37:32.92
Okay, this is real land now.

664
00:37:32.92 --> 00:37:33.92
Okay, this is real shooting.

665
00:37:33.92 --> 00:37:36.000
Okay, this is, you know, actual romantries.

666
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.48
And then you get to a seal team where you go through more training.

667
00:37:39.48 --> 00:37:41.96
But it seems like it, that's why I was kind of, I guess I was kind of surprised.

668
00:37:41.96 --> 00:37:47.08
That guys that had been through enough stuff already would get to that.

669
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:49.28
And still be like, you know, I don't want to do this.

670
00:37:49.28 --> 00:37:50.88
That seems crazy to me.

671
00:37:50.88 --> 00:37:52.28
Yeah, that's a gut check.

672
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:58.60
I mean, and that's one of the things that is interesting, you know, but it's does a good

673
00:37:58.60 --> 00:38:01.000
job of eating people out up front.

674
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.40
And so you have a pretty high quality care, you know, as far as the, in tangibles, the

675
00:38:06.40 --> 00:38:09.60
ethical and character principles.

676
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:16.40
And then for us, you know, it's kind of, I would say more on a sustained, sustained beat

677
00:38:16.40 --> 00:38:17.40
down.

678
00:38:17.40 --> 00:38:18.40
Yeah.

679
00:38:18.40 --> 00:38:23.68
Yeah, and so I mean, we started, I think we started the course with like 50 or 60 guys and

680
00:38:23.68 --> 00:38:25.32
13 of the original guys finished.

681
00:38:25.32 --> 00:38:27.72
No, that's changed a lot since then.

682
00:38:27.72 --> 00:38:29.32
So we grown up a lot since then.

683
00:38:29.32 --> 00:38:33.40
And just like Buds has right like, oh, yeah, you know, I bet back in the day, those

684
00:38:33.40 --> 00:38:37.12
new Marsock instructors like no one's getting through my course.

685
00:38:37.12 --> 00:38:39.08
Yeah, right, flee so.

686
00:38:39.08 --> 00:38:43.68
But the cool thing about it, no, I see both sides of the token, but the cool thing about

687
00:38:43.68 --> 00:38:46.12
it now is that we want more guy.

688
00:38:46.12 --> 00:38:47.12
We need more guys.

689
00:38:47.12 --> 00:38:48.12
Yeah.

690
00:38:48.12 --> 00:38:49.12
We don't want to lower the standards.

691
00:38:49.12 --> 00:38:51.32
So why don't we just be smarter about it, right?

692
00:38:51.32 --> 00:38:55.32
Like, if we do a better job of selecting guys or get more guys starting or whatever else,

693
00:38:55.32 --> 00:39:01.44
right, like, if the output is a trained operator and we need these guys, then was there

694
00:39:01.44 --> 00:39:03.60
any part of that training that you thought was hard?

695
00:39:03.60 --> 00:39:05.60
Yeah, a lot of those are.

696
00:39:05.60 --> 00:39:08.76
Was there anything that you were in jeopardy on where?

697
00:39:08.76 --> 00:39:10.48
Actually, yeah, so the same thing, right?

698
00:39:10.48 --> 00:39:14.76
So how, you know, Naval Academy was humbling, being the Marine Corps, been humbling.

699
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:17.92
And at that point, I was a pretty humble guy.

700
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:20.80
And so I did really well throughout the majority of training.

701
00:39:20.80 --> 00:39:27.28
And so in the last phase, I'll feel good about yourself.

702
00:39:27.28 --> 00:39:32.52
I was okay, but I said, you know, so we're doing the unconventional warfare package very similar

703
00:39:32.52 --> 00:39:38.000
to a very similar, uh, with the Greenbraze, with their final exercise and infoying with

704
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.32
the G-Force and everything else.

705
00:39:39.32 --> 00:39:40.76
And so, was doing well.

706
00:39:40.76 --> 00:39:45.76
And then, uh, had a bad meeting where somebody thought I came off a little bit arrogant

707
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:47.16
with our G-Force commander and everything.

708
00:39:47.16 --> 00:39:51.76
And so then they just kind of, you know, put the spotlight on me and, you know, put

709
00:39:51.76 --> 00:39:54.92
me, put me on the bubble right because like, you fail anything and you're done.

710
00:39:54.92 --> 00:39:58.44
And so, you know, that was one of the scarier times, right?

711
00:39:58.44 --> 00:40:02.40
Because I committed years of my life to be able to be doing the successfully.

712
00:40:02.40 --> 00:40:07.32
And then, in a moment, you know, if I can't figure out how to make this guy like me or

713
00:40:07.32 --> 00:40:12.36
this G-Force commander, you know, execute this mission with me, like, I'm on the bubble,

714
00:40:12.36 --> 00:40:13.36
right?

715
00:40:13.36 --> 00:40:16.40
And I think, you know, some of its instructors mess around, but they're just testing you, right?

716
00:40:16.40 --> 00:40:18.76
Like, you know, how do you deal with failure?

717
00:40:18.76 --> 00:40:19.76
Right?

718
00:40:19.76 --> 00:40:24.56
Because if you've been successful thus far in a good number of things, uh, let's push

719
00:40:24.56 --> 00:40:26.80
him beyond his limits, let's break him and see what happens, right?

720
00:40:26.80 --> 00:40:30.76
And I don't know if that was exactly the case I didn't see behind the curtain, but I survived.

721
00:40:30.76 --> 00:40:34.92
I failed something called pool competency.

722
00:40:34.92 --> 00:40:39.68
And I failed pool competency, which is they put your dive rig on, which is an old school

723
00:40:39.68 --> 00:40:45.16
dive rig with, uh, with an inhalation and an exhalation tube.

724
00:40:45.16 --> 00:40:49.92
And it's this, this, this old thing from like the 60s or 70s or something, alcohol

725
00:40:49.92 --> 00:40:51.44
long.

726
00:40:51.44 --> 00:40:56.32
And, uh, you have to do all this stuff that they tell you to do underwater and they're,

727
00:40:56.32 --> 00:41:00.12
they're slapping you around and smashing you and ripping your mask off and ripping you

728
00:41:00.12 --> 00:41:03.000
regulator out and all this stuff and you have to stay calm and you have to go through

729
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.96
all these procedures.

730
00:41:04.96 --> 00:41:11.12
And when I went through, it was a 30 minute evolution and, uh, the first time I did it,

731
00:41:11.12 --> 00:41:14.28
my instructor who ended up working for me in the future.

732
00:41:14.28 --> 00:41:18.000
He was a, well, he was a first class at the time, but he became a one-off series, a

733
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.60
UDTV and non-guy and awesome guy.

734
00:41:20.60 --> 00:41:22.16
But he failed me.

735
00:41:22.16 --> 00:41:27.76
And, um, yeah, as so, I failed in the years later, I talked to him and I was like, hey,

736
00:41:27.76 --> 00:41:29.04
you remember putting me through pool competency?

737
00:41:29.04 --> 00:41:30.36
Yeah, I was just messing with you.

738
00:41:30.36 --> 00:41:32.96
And I'm like, whoa, you must ruin my life.

739
00:41:32.96 --> 00:41:34.16
I thought you were talking about your disability.

740
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:36.16
You guys know you do fine next time.

741
00:41:36.16 --> 00:41:40.88
But same thing, like it was a test of, let's just see how this guy does.

742
00:41:40.88 --> 00:41:46.76
But what we did over the weekend, me in a couple of buddies that were, that it also failed.

743
00:41:46.76 --> 00:41:53.04
We went in the dip tank, which was just a square metal box that was filled with water

744
00:41:53.04 --> 00:41:54.68
and we pooled comp to each other.

745
00:41:54.68 --> 00:41:56.56
This, I don't even, I can't even believe we did this.

746
00:41:56.56 --> 00:41:59.12
It was probably the most unsafe thing I did.

747
00:41:59.12 --> 00:42:04.84
Well, one of the top unsafe things I did was we drowned each other and trashed each other,

748
00:42:04.84 --> 00:42:05.84
getting ready and we did it.

749
00:42:05.84 --> 00:42:09.44
It took each other over and over again until we were like, there's no way we were going to fail.

750
00:42:09.44 --> 00:42:10.44
And so that's what we did.

751
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:11.44
There's four of us or something.

752
00:42:11.44 --> 00:42:15.28
We just spent the weekend in the, I don't even, I can't even believe they let us do that.

753
00:42:15.28 --> 00:42:18.12
They just gave us dive gear and so you're just going to play with a dive gear cool.

754
00:42:18.12 --> 00:42:20.12
We're in the dip tank, like, idiots.

755
00:42:20.12 --> 00:42:21.44
Different time, right?

756
00:42:21.44 --> 00:42:22.44
Yeah.

757
00:42:22.44 --> 00:42:23.44
Yeah.

758
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:24.44
But it is humbling.

759
00:42:24.44 --> 00:42:28.44
And it's one of those things, you know, there's no worse feeling for me than that feeling

760
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:36.04
of like, oh, if I fail this, this is like my whole life dream done and destroyed.

761
00:42:36.04 --> 00:42:40.36
So yeah, they make, they play those, they play those games with you.

762
00:42:40.36 --> 00:42:44.92
Yeah, I think they have to play those games with you because you're going to fail in other

763
00:42:44.92 --> 00:42:48.60
situations once you get to the, to the teams, you know, you want to, you do want to see

764
00:42:48.60 --> 00:42:50.12
how people are going to do it fair.

765
00:42:50.12 --> 00:42:54.52
And they would do things like that in Buds where, you know, they would, there would be

766
00:42:54.52 --> 00:42:57.84
seven people that would pass a swim.

767
00:42:57.84 --> 00:43:02.72
Everyone else is a failure and they, you know, tell us new, they, they line us all up and

768
00:43:02.72 --> 00:43:07.44
make every single make a hundred guys sign a chip that we were losing our failures on the

769
00:43:07.44 --> 00:43:08.44
swim.

770
00:43:08.44 --> 00:43:10.60
And if they fail, if we fail again, we're going to be dropping training.

771
00:43:10.60 --> 00:43:12.32
I don't think that was actually true.

772
00:43:12.32 --> 00:43:15.44
I don't know, but it didn't look back at the time I believe.

773
00:43:15.44 --> 00:43:17.56
It's time was like, oh my god.

774
00:43:17.56 --> 00:43:22.84
So they do a good job of that psychological warfare on you in that training.

775
00:43:22.84 --> 00:43:23.84
Yeah.

776
00:43:23.84 --> 00:43:27.72
And I was like before that, too, that, you know, another pretty intense phase.

777
00:43:27.72 --> 00:43:31.84
So we do the CQB initial CQB phase prior to that, too.

778
00:43:31.84 --> 00:43:34.96
And that one was saying that was pretty high stakes.

779
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:35.96
Pretty high stress.

780
00:43:35.96 --> 00:43:38.16
Did you mess up?

781
00:43:38.16 --> 00:43:39.92
No, I was, I was okay there.

782
00:43:39.92 --> 00:43:40.92
Yeah, I didn't have any issues.

783
00:43:40.92 --> 00:43:42.40
Keep it throwny rounds.

784
00:43:42.40 --> 00:43:44.88
You shoot me any hostages.

785
00:43:44.88 --> 00:43:46.88
No, I shot a hostage one time.

786
00:43:46.88 --> 00:43:50.48
No, I shot a hop, just in training, but yeah, obviously just in training.

787
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:54.24
But this guy, they had a target set up.

788
00:43:54.24 --> 00:43:58.32
You know, those, those, they look like a water-caller painting targets.

789
00:43:58.32 --> 00:43:59.84
So they're different characters.

790
00:43:59.84 --> 00:44:04.28
And you could take little, you could take the person's hand and you could paste over

791
00:44:04.28 --> 00:44:09.92
like a pistol or a cell phone or a badge or a whatever.

792
00:44:09.92 --> 00:44:12.36
So I come into this room and it's, it's kind of dusk.

793
00:44:12.36 --> 00:44:13.60
And this was, this was back in the day.

794
00:44:13.60 --> 00:44:15.12
So we didn't even use night vision.

795
00:44:15.12 --> 00:44:19.52
This is just like, day, you know, we're just shooting with our eyesight, a regular eyesight.

796
00:44:19.52 --> 00:44:24.48
And I come in and there's a guy and I look at his hands and I see like a dark pipe

797
00:44:24.48 --> 00:44:29.40
pointed at me and I drilled this dude, you know, to the chest, one to the hand.

798
00:44:29.40 --> 00:44:30.40
Yes.

799
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:35.84
And we get done to the run and the instructor, he comes out and he's like, he's holding

800
00:44:35.84 --> 00:44:40.04
the target in his hands and he's like, he's like, hey, Jockel, look at this.

801
00:44:40.04 --> 00:44:42.08
And I was like, check.

802
00:44:42.08 --> 00:44:44.24
And he goes, what do you see?

803
00:44:44.24 --> 00:44:49.44
And what it was was it was allegedly, it was a rolled up newspaper that he was

804
00:44:49.44 --> 00:44:54.40
pointing at the, at you, you know, at me.

805
00:44:54.40 --> 00:44:58.32
And it looked like, of the barrel of a gun.

806
00:44:58.32 --> 00:45:02.000
And I, and I looked at the instructor, I was like, hey, bro, if I come into a room and

807
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
someone's doing that, they're going to die.

808
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.24
I'm sorry, man, you can't do that.

809
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:08.36
Because the guy looks all jacked.

810
00:45:08.36 --> 00:45:11.88
He's just guy, this guy with the green shirt, I'm going to find one of these and post it.

811
00:45:11.88 --> 00:45:13.12
Because I'm sure you can find them.

812
00:45:13.12 --> 00:45:17.96
It's the guy with the green shirt, super thick neck and looks all hostile and aggressive.

813
00:45:17.96 --> 00:45:21.32
And he's pointing this pipe at me and I drilled them.

814
00:45:21.32 --> 00:45:22.72
And I got in trouble, that was mine.

815
00:45:22.72 --> 00:45:26.000
You know, whatever had to run a tire or something like that.

816
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.20
But that was when I was in the team.

817
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:31.32
So I was, you know, hey, horrible.

818
00:45:31.32 --> 00:45:33.64
Then you do, you know, even though I was like, hey, I'll do that anyways.

819
00:45:33.64 --> 00:45:37.28
But inside, and you know, even though I was like, man, that, you know, you got to be better

820
00:45:37.28 --> 00:45:38.28
than that.

821
00:45:38.28 --> 00:45:40.72
And that was jacked up for me to do that.

822
00:45:40.72 --> 00:45:45.64
And so I had to check hands more carefully and be more patient and take a not shop to make

823
00:45:45.64 --> 00:45:48.32
sure what I'm looking at is what I'm looking at.

824
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:52.08
So yeah, failure is a good teacher and it's very humbling.

825
00:45:52.08 --> 00:45:58.04
And then, so do you guys have like a full-on graduation ceremony from that?

826
00:45:58.04 --> 00:45:59.04
Do you get a pin?

827
00:45:59.04 --> 00:46:00.04
Do you get that new radar pin?

828
00:46:00.04 --> 00:46:01.04
They do now.

829
00:46:01.04 --> 00:46:02.04
Yeah.

830
00:46:02.04 --> 00:46:02.80
And we didn't have one at the time.

831
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:05.08
So we've grown up.

832
00:46:05.08 --> 00:46:06.80
We weren't called Raiders and we didn't have a pin.

833
00:46:06.80 --> 00:46:10.68
So we just got a little certificate and handshake and sent it on our way.

834
00:46:10.68 --> 00:46:12.000
And then you went to where?

835
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.28
And then I was assigned to Campittleton, California.

836
00:46:15.28 --> 00:46:19.64
So I moved out here with my wife and joined First Marine Raider Battalion.

837
00:46:19.64 --> 00:46:22.04
And that was your first time being out at Pendleton.

838
00:46:22.04 --> 00:46:23.04
Correct.

839
00:46:23.04 --> 00:46:24.04
Yeah.

840
00:46:24.04 --> 00:46:25.04
How do you like Pendleton?

841
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:26.04
I love it.

842
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:27.04
It's awesome.

843
00:46:27.04 --> 00:46:28.04
Still live here.

844
00:46:28.04 --> 00:46:31.40
Didn't make it far, even though my wife's family, all her family is still in Delaware.

845
00:46:31.40 --> 00:46:32.40
Yeah.

846
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:33.40
We love it here.

847
00:46:33.40 --> 00:46:34.40
Hope to never leave.

848
00:46:34.40 --> 00:46:38.56
It's, Pendleton is, is awesome training ground.

849
00:46:38.56 --> 00:46:41.12
I mean, really awesome training ground.

850
00:46:41.12 --> 00:46:42.12
Yes.

851
00:46:42.12 --> 00:46:43.12
Yeah, it's great.

852
00:46:43.12 --> 00:46:44.28
Great place to train.

853
00:46:44.28 --> 00:46:48.72
We did a lot of our training there and typical places out in the desert in Alec Forder when

854
00:46:48.72 --> 00:46:50.000
in a couple of places.

855
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.40
But yeah, it's good.

856
00:46:51.40 --> 00:46:52.40
It's massive.

857
00:46:52.40 --> 00:46:53.40
I had no idea how big it was.

858
00:46:53.40 --> 00:46:55.52
But just huge.

859
00:46:55.52 --> 00:46:58.20
And then how long was that work up for?

860
00:46:58.20 --> 00:47:04.000
We had, so I arrived in August and I was in the, the three shop in the operation section

861
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.60
before I went to a team for about two months.

862
00:47:06.60 --> 00:47:09.04
And then we deployed in May.

863
00:47:09.04 --> 00:47:12.36
So on nine months that I was with the team.

864
00:47:12.36 --> 00:47:14.04
They had done there.

865
00:47:14.04 --> 00:47:18.24
The work up cycle, I think was probably similar to, you know, with the seal teams that

866
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:21.60
done where it's, you know, you come back, you go back and immediately guys are shuck

867
00:47:21.60 --> 00:47:25.20
out to schools, individual training, and then come back to collective training, and then

868
00:47:25.20 --> 00:47:26.20
deploy.

869
00:47:26.20 --> 00:47:31.76
So I got there right when I produced a trickling back in from a lot of the individual schools

870
00:47:31.76 --> 00:47:33.44
that they were going to.

871
00:47:33.44 --> 00:47:36.44
And then how big is the team that you take over?

872
00:47:36.44 --> 00:47:39.04
We had 20 total with attachments.

873
00:47:39.04 --> 00:47:44.88
And so each team is about 14 or not about exactly 14.

874
00:47:44.88 --> 00:47:49.92
So there's, you know, small headquarters element and then two formant elements, two

875
00:47:49.92 --> 00:47:53.92
corpsmen, you know, medics.

876
00:47:53.92 --> 00:48:01.32
And then we plused up with our interlassets and EOD and gotten country, got some dog

877
00:48:01.32 --> 00:48:04.04
analytics and some other stuff as well with our team.

878
00:48:04.04 --> 00:48:07.12
And then, and that when you say you got in country, this is, this is you to deploy

879
00:48:07.12 --> 00:48:08.12
to Afghanistan.

880
00:48:08.12 --> 00:48:08.96
Yes.

881
00:48:08.96 --> 00:48:10.96
Now it's 2012.

882
00:48:10.96 --> 00:48:11.96
Correct.

883
00:48:11.96 --> 00:48:12.96
Yeah, 2012.

884
00:48:12.96 --> 00:48:19.96
So I'd gotten out of training in 2011 and then deployed in May of 2012.

885
00:48:19.96 --> 00:48:23.76
And then what was that when you were going into that deployment, what was the atmosphere

886
00:48:23.76 --> 00:48:27.20
in Afghanistan at that time?

887
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:29.56
The atmosphere was different.

888
00:48:29.56 --> 00:48:31.60
Depending upon the region you were in, very, very different.

889
00:48:31.60 --> 00:48:37.56
So where we were going was highly kinetic.

890
00:48:37.56 --> 00:48:42.56
And I got run around all over the place, just killer be killed and focusing a lot on security

891
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:45.40
and combat operations.

892
00:48:45.40 --> 00:48:51.80
And so there were two mission sets that our teams would perform.

893
00:48:51.80 --> 00:48:54.92
Either they would be doing a program called Village stability operations, which is what

894
00:48:54.92 --> 00:49:00.52
we were doing or they would be assigned to a commando, Kandak, Battalion, which is more like

895
00:49:00.52 --> 00:49:03.68
Afghanistan's version of, you know, Ranger Regiment or anything else.

896
00:49:03.68 --> 00:49:07.28
And so when we deployed, we deployed with the company.

897
00:49:07.28 --> 00:49:09.20
So we had three marine teams.

898
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:12.56
One of our teams took over a commando mission and the other two were doing Village stability

899
00:49:12.56 --> 00:49:13.56
operations.

900
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:19.44
And then as we deployed, we took over a couple of seal units and a green bright team as

901
00:49:19.44 --> 00:49:23.28
well, that reported to our company headquarters as well.

902
00:49:23.28 --> 00:49:29.52
So specifically for our team where we went, we were in very, very primitive rural area

903
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:34.68
in the middle of the helmet province, right in the green zone.

904
00:49:34.68 --> 00:49:38.92
So the, which green zone means something different in Afghanistan than it did in Iraq.

905
00:49:38.92 --> 00:49:45.76
Green zone in Iraq was an area in Baghdad actually that was, that was controlled and safe

906
00:49:45.76 --> 00:49:52.12
and and all good to go for Americans and there was, you know, other people living there

907
00:49:52.12 --> 00:49:54.000
and whatnot is brews it.

908
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.12
This safe zone.

909
00:49:55.12 --> 00:49:58.20
And the green zone in Afghanistan is not that.

910
00:49:58.20 --> 00:49:59.20
No, no.

911
00:49:59.20 --> 00:50:04.40
So the green zone in Afghanistan literally is due to vegetation.

912
00:50:04.40 --> 00:50:09.48
And so the green zone, Afghanistan is mostly air it or desert climate and there's very

913
00:50:09.48 --> 00:50:14.24
little green areas or good farmland essentially.

914
00:50:14.24 --> 00:50:16.80
And I think it was in the 60s.

915
00:50:16.80 --> 00:50:21.52
I think it was the USA or another international development agency built another canal off

916
00:50:21.52 --> 00:50:23.24
of the Helmend River.

917
00:50:23.24 --> 00:50:29.40
And so in between those two waterways was good farmland because farmers there would, you know,

918
00:50:29.40 --> 00:50:32.52
cut out canals and everything else to grow crops.

919
00:50:32.52 --> 00:50:37.28
And so this was like one of the only green areas in the entire country.

920
00:50:37.28 --> 00:50:41.60
And so that's what they mean even the Afghanistan version of the green zone.

921
00:50:41.60 --> 00:50:48.20
And since the vegetation is also covered in concealment for fighters for any fighters.

922
00:50:48.20 --> 00:50:49.20
Yeah.

923
00:50:49.20 --> 00:50:52.80
And so where we were it was, it was tough because guys would use those canals to sneak

924
00:50:52.80 --> 00:50:57.04
up and it was very undulating or hilly terrain.

925
00:50:57.04 --> 00:50:59.52
I would consider it when I tried to explain it to most people too.

926
00:50:59.52 --> 00:51:07.04
I consider it more similar to trench warfare than just desert open warfare where you can

927
00:51:07.04 --> 00:51:09.40
see other people.

928
00:51:09.40 --> 00:51:14.16
People are very able to especially with some of the urban structures there as well.

929
00:51:14.16 --> 00:51:19.44
Some of them, if I was able to creep up and you know, try to get the drop on you and

930
00:51:19.44 --> 00:51:22.000
get close to your position.

931
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.16
So these, so you were doing VSO, the village stability operations.

932
00:51:27.16 --> 00:51:31.72
And what did that, what did kind of what was your standard VSO mission look like?

933
00:51:31.72 --> 00:51:34.40
What was that deal?

934
00:51:34.40 --> 00:51:38.24
So for the VSO mission, we had three lines of effort.

935
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:41.68
So the first was to establish security.

936
00:51:41.68 --> 00:51:45.84
And the second was to try to revive economic development.

937
00:51:45.84 --> 00:51:47.44
And then the third was to link political governance.

938
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:53.28
So the three lines of effort, security development governance for political governance.

939
00:51:53.28 --> 00:51:56.80
Couldn't really focus on economic development or political governance if the villagers didn't

940
00:51:56.80 --> 00:51:57.80
have security.

941
00:51:57.80 --> 00:52:01.68
And so one of the first things that we did, and we took over a pretty capable force because

942
00:52:01.68 --> 00:52:07.50
people had been doing this mission a lot before us in this region, they would train and

943
00:52:07.50 --> 00:52:12.04
equip a small police force called the Afghan local police.

944
00:52:12.04 --> 00:52:19.28
And so the idea was, was if you take people in these small communities that are from there,

945
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:22.88
train them, pay them to provide security that they would be more effective at providing

946
00:52:22.88 --> 00:52:25.92
security than any Americans would be.

947
00:52:25.92 --> 00:52:27.92
Which is, in most cases, very true.

948
00:52:27.92 --> 00:52:36.80
And so we took over the site and we had about probably 100 or more Afghans that were on

949
00:52:36.80 --> 00:52:39.60
our payrolls to help go and provide security for there.

950
00:52:39.60 --> 00:52:46.76
And so that was primarily what we focused on because we were still trying to train them,

951
00:52:46.76 --> 00:52:49.36
get them to a place where they could, for my security for themselves.

952
00:52:49.36 --> 00:52:54.80
So is this multiple, multiple villages in like an area that you're providing security for

953
00:52:54.80 --> 00:53:00.04
that these Afghans are providing security or is it like one big, like larger village?

954
00:53:00.04 --> 00:53:02.28
For us it was just one village.

955
00:53:02.28 --> 00:53:04.76
It wasn't even that big honestly.

956
00:53:04.76 --> 00:53:11.68
So we literally, as far as operational areas and things I think ours was a few kilometers

957
00:53:11.68 --> 00:53:12.68
max.

958
00:53:12.68 --> 00:53:15.20
So we were, yeah, because super focused.

959
00:53:15.20 --> 00:53:19.44
Where we were was essentially a minefield.

960
00:53:19.44 --> 00:53:25.24
We were right in the middle of this contested region, prime poppy growing area.

961
00:53:25.24 --> 00:53:30.68
So Taliban wanted it and then the farmers would grow poppy and that was their economic,

962
00:53:30.68 --> 00:53:34.000
you know, that was their payday, their paychecks.

963
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.80
And so very complex problem to try to change.

964
00:53:37.80 --> 00:53:41.72
And so we sort of, do you live in the villages?

965
00:53:41.72 --> 00:53:43.04
Did you live there?

966
00:53:43.04 --> 00:53:47.80
So you took over some houses or whatever and then you set up your base of operations and

967
00:53:47.80 --> 00:53:48.80
you lived there.

968
00:53:48.80 --> 00:53:54.04
Essentially, yeah, we took basically, we were unable to really take over any houses,

969
00:53:54.04 --> 00:53:57.56
because all the houses that run occupied were all full of IDs.

970
00:53:57.56 --> 00:54:03.44
So the TTP in base of what we had done at that time was wherever we were going to set up

971
00:54:03.44 --> 00:54:07.84
we would bulldoze and just build structures on our own, you know, Hasco Varriers, but it was

972
00:54:07.84 --> 00:54:08.84
very primitive.

973
00:54:08.84 --> 00:54:13.60
We had no running water, just living in a dust bowl essentially.

974
00:54:13.60 --> 00:54:16.76
Get some towers up for security and then that was pretty much it.

975
00:54:16.76 --> 00:54:20.84
And there's how many of you out in this remote location.

976
00:54:20.84 --> 00:54:25.72
We ended up having two sites and so we had mutual supporting positions within our team and

977
00:54:25.72 --> 00:54:30.92
I think we had probably 60 Americans.

978
00:54:30.92 --> 00:54:36.40
So we had our 20 guys and then we actually had a trailer platoon of Army infantry guys out

979
00:54:36.40 --> 00:54:37.40
there as well.

980
00:54:37.40 --> 00:54:41.76
And so they would help provide security and sandpose and allow us to go out and do missions.

981
00:54:41.76 --> 00:54:45.20
So now you get into doing missions and what does that look like?

982
00:54:45.20 --> 00:54:51.32
You're going out, you have to take people, you have to move people, you have to go and

983
00:54:51.32 --> 00:54:52.52
meet people.

984
00:54:52.52 --> 00:54:59.64
Like what was the kind of standard when you say mission to execute from those little

985
00:54:59.64 --> 00:55:03.92
forward operating bases, what was kind of the standard mission that you would execute?

986
00:55:03.92 --> 00:55:09.76
Yeah, so the mission is varied, but for the most part, and I was only there for about

987
00:55:09.76 --> 00:55:10.76
two months.

988
00:55:10.76 --> 00:55:16.96
And before I got injured and came back, but the team we took over for done a really good

989
00:55:16.96 --> 00:55:23.000
job and they had some very challenging human dynamics within the A.O.

990
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.48
They're going to attack multiple times a day.

991
00:55:26.48 --> 00:55:32.64
So when we got there, we tried to do whatever we could to proactively prevent that from

992
00:55:32.64 --> 00:55:33.64
happening.

993
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:40.72
And so the standard practice that we would do is we'd go outside out of much patrols.

994
00:55:40.72 --> 00:55:44.52
We tried to find guys who were coming to kill them before they got us.

995
00:55:44.52 --> 00:55:53.44
So to do that is not an insignificant task, especially when you're going through a minefield.

996
00:55:53.44 --> 00:55:59.12
And so the TTPs that we kind of used at that time was we would go into the cover darkness,

997
00:55:59.12 --> 00:56:05.44
which will allow us time to slowly and methodically get to where we wanted to go, take

998
00:56:05.44 --> 00:56:11.96
over a compound or a building and then just stay there all day and observe and see what happened.

999
00:56:11.96 --> 00:56:15.52
And then that next night, usually, X-Fill, one of the cover darkness again.

1000
00:56:15.52 --> 00:56:23.52
And the main reason to do that was because a lot of the IDs that were out and set up were

1001
00:56:23.52 --> 00:56:26.92
in positions where there were just so many of them.

1002
00:56:26.92 --> 00:56:32.000
And they were in positions that were advantageous and would be observed by the enemy.

1003
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.32
So if an entire compound had a few different IDs in it, and we started to realize that,

1004
00:56:38.32 --> 00:56:42.48
hey, we can't go in these compounds or we can't go near them because if there's nobody

1005
00:56:42.48 --> 00:56:46.68
in it, most of the time they have IDs, the enemy would then wait until we were in a position

1006
00:56:46.68 --> 00:56:52.28
and just fire a few shots at us, trying to drive us into those positions and things.

1007
00:56:52.28 --> 00:56:57.64
And so just in general, we just preferred operate at night because they didn't have night

1008
00:56:57.64 --> 00:57:02.12
and the opportunity to get the ability to do that to us at night and we were able to take our time

1009
00:57:02.12 --> 00:57:07.48
and move very slowly and methodically through the ID threat that we encountered.

1010
00:57:07.48 --> 00:57:11.56
And so that's how we were able to try to mitigate that.

1011
00:57:11.56 --> 00:57:15.04
And that was how we would usually connect those missions.

1012
00:57:15.04 --> 00:57:22.44
And then how often would you actually get contact when you were out and set up in an ambush position?

1013
00:57:22.44 --> 00:57:27.44
I think almost 100% of the time, I felt like that at least.

1014
00:57:27.44 --> 00:57:30.44
And so we wouldn't go out every day.

1015
00:57:30.44 --> 00:57:36.28
So we'd stagger the ID as an officer with the operational number of people that we had.

1016
00:57:36.28 --> 00:57:41.04
We're trying to maximize the bank for our buck and to be very efficient with that.

1017
00:57:41.04 --> 00:57:45.24
While also running other operations and trying to build the police force and other types

1018
00:57:45.24 --> 00:57:49.24
of, you know, operative operations.

1019
00:57:49.24 --> 00:57:51.24
And so we'd go up probably a few days.

1020
00:57:51.24 --> 00:57:54.24
So this is a very aggressive VSO mission.

1021
00:57:54.24 --> 00:57:55.24
Yeah.

1022
00:57:55.24 --> 00:57:58.24
I mean, this is the most aggressive than I was thinking.

1023
00:57:58.24 --> 00:58:02.24
The term that was thrown around by some of the guys was Smashmouth.

1024
00:58:02.24 --> 00:58:04.24
VSO.

1025
00:58:04.24 --> 00:58:11.24
And so if you look at the entire landscape of Africa and it's staying from the highest levels of command and everything there were, you know,

1026
00:58:11.24 --> 00:58:13.24
green, yellow and red areas.

1027
00:58:13.24 --> 00:58:19.24
And if you looked at that based on enemy activity or friendlyness to coalition forces,

1028
00:58:19.24 --> 00:58:24.24
the traditional model for VSO was, hey, put them in yellow areas.

1029
00:58:24.24 --> 00:58:26.24
You know, we're likely to be successful.

1030
00:58:26.24 --> 00:58:32.24
We can make some progress, not in red areas, right, where people will just fight to the death.

1031
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:34.24
And you know, there's no chance of this happening.

1032
00:58:34.24 --> 00:58:39.24
And so different people have different thoughts of what's green yellow and red.

1033
00:58:39.24 --> 00:58:45.24
And so when we ended up there and that was our mission, we tried to make them all stuff it.

1034
00:58:45.24 --> 00:58:46.24
So, but yeah, very different.

1035
00:58:46.24 --> 00:58:52.24
And so that and we even had teams, other Marines were out in the west and her out province, which was very different than the Helman province.

1036
00:58:52.24 --> 00:59:11.24
And so on, her out province, guys are, you know, walk around with just a pistol and driving on motorbikes and, you know, drinking tea and hanging out, no helmets like, you know, not getting shot at, very, very, very different experience than, then where we were.

1037
00:59:11.24 --> 00:59:18.24
That was great because we're just glad different places of, you know, different portions of the country were successful with that mission set.

1038
00:59:18.24 --> 00:59:25.24
And I think to a lot, large degree, most of the special operations students that conduct that mission were very successful.

1039
00:59:25.24 --> 00:59:31.24
And for us, you know, it's debatable, how successful we were, but that was a very different environment.

1040
00:59:31.24 --> 00:59:36.24
Yeah, I know there were guys that were going over to do it and they would ask me about, you know, what do you think of this?

1041
00:59:36.24 --> 00:59:44.24
I was going to do this village, stability thing and I was like, oh, you're going to go out in the middle of, you know, Indian country with your platoon.

1042
00:59:44.24 --> 00:59:51.24
That's going to be an awesome mission, like it's going to be great. Go get some go do a good job. I mean, that's just a, it's a cool mission.

1043
00:59:51.24 --> 00:59:57.24
It's just to be out there on your own. I mean, how much oversight did you have out there?

1044
00:59:57.24 --> 00:59:58.24
Not much.

1045
00:59:58.24 --> 01:00:05.24
I mean, and that was one of the coolest things was having the freedom to go and execute. And so, you know, whether or not it was, you know,

1046
01:00:05.24 --> 01:00:11.24
destined for success based on what the situation was, we were going to do the best we could to make it success.

1047
01:00:11.24 --> 01:00:24.24
And we had a lot of resources to do that when it was, you know, the intelligence assets that we had at our disposal, you know, as a captain in the Marine Corps had assets that were, like, more than a Mucamander.

1048
01:00:24.24 --> 01:00:25.24
Right.

1049
01:00:25.24 --> 01:00:29.24
And it's something for cast and air support.

1050
01:00:29.24 --> 01:00:47.24
Our OE was a bit restrictive for conventional forces. And for us, you know, we were able to, as long as we met certain criteria and, you know, able to justify it, we're able to drop cast where we needed to, you know, which was very different. And so we did the best we could and made the most of it.

1051
01:00:47.24 --> 01:00:54.24
And then you're a couple months into deployment and that's when you got, that's when you got wounded.

1052
01:00:54.24 --> 01:01:04.24
Yeah, and what happened on that? Oh, yeah. So we're starting to have some successes with the security bubble that we were establishing.

1053
01:01:04.24 --> 01:01:15.24
And so we pushed a little bit further from our base to try to see where we thought there would be an impactivity. And so we went about, I think maybe a click and a half one foot from our base.

1054
01:01:15.24 --> 01:01:34.24
And found ourselves in any country essentially. So we occupied a compound on the cover darkness and surely after the sun rose immediately started seeing heavy activity around us and started getting engaged from multiple directions with different weapon systems.

1055
01:01:34.24 --> 01:01:50.24
And so shortly after that happened, there were three Marines on the rooftop of the compound that were in. We had the rest of the Marines down surrounded, protected, or should be protected by the rest of the compound walls.

1056
01:01:50.24 --> 01:02:02.24
So most of the construction of Afghanistan is mud mud huts and despite not having running water electricity or anything, they were able to build these massive fortifications around E-tiles.

1057
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:17.24
And so we're going to have the walls protect you, but you can't see anything. So you also don't have situation on awareness on what's going on. So as a commander as a leader of the patrol, swap out with Brian Jacqueline, who's on the rooftop at that time to try to get awareness.

1058
01:02:17.24 --> 01:02:30.24
So we started observing different things going on and as always up there, and we fight our head, engage us from our flank. And so myself and another Marine on the rooftop were shot.

1059
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:50.24
So I was able to roll off without getting shot. And so immediately bullet went into my shoulder and into my spine. So I just felt a pulsing sensation in my back and kind of slumped over saw Ricky who was the sergeant to my left. He had been shot through the neck and was faced down on the rooftop.

1060
01:02:50.24 --> 01:03:01.24
So I took myself, pick myself up and realize nothing below my chest was working. So immediately got on the radio, call my guys told him that I've been hit and that Ricky had been hit and this sprung in action.

1061
01:03:01.24 --> 01:03:11.24
And so took the initiative to return fire, gain fire superiority and triage us and continue to fight.

1062
01:03:11.24 --> 01:03:24.24
So I'm so long to that last. It's a long time. I mean, you're out there in the middle of nowhere and you're in a really hostile situation. How long did it take to get assets there?

1063
01:03:24.24 --> 01:03:27.24
That's that's pretty timely.

1064
01:03:27.24 --> 01:03:38.24
But it was also very chaotic situation. So at that time, we had 10 Americans out on the mission. We had 10 of our Afghan partnered force with us.

1065
01:03:38.24 --> 01:03:43.24
And so now we're down to eight Americans to our critically wounded.

1066
01:03:43.24 --> 01:03:48.24
We had to pull guns off the line as well to treat us soarmetic immediately started treating Ricky and I.

1067
01:03:48.24 --> 01:03:53.24
Another Marine, serge treating me as well as that leaf six Brian Jackland.

1068
01:03:53.24 --> 01:04:01.24
It made it the god on the radio and started to try to call in for metavank and air support.

1069
01:04:01.24 --> 01:04:12.24
At that same moment Murphy's luck kicked in as well and the sack common 10 came down and so our sack coming 10 came down. So we're now Brian was relaying through our main position.

1070
01:04:12.24 --> 01:04:17.24
All the information that was going on and so getting pretty chaotic.

1071
01:04:17.24 --> 01:04:28.24
And took about I think 30 minutes or so before the metavank helicopter was able to come in and get us out.

1072
01:04:28.24 --> 01:04:35.24
And how bad was that was the other guy's name that was hit Ricky.

1073
01:04:35.24 --> 01:04:40.24
Yeah. And so he got shot in the neck like what what was at all about.

1074
01:04:40.24 --> 01:04:47.24
Yeah, I mean, we all thought he was dead and turns out he was very, very lucky.

1075
01:04:47.24 --> 01:04:51.24
So missed everything important as neck, missed his windpipe, missed his spine.

1076
01:04:51.24 --> 01:05:01.24
He was unconscious for a while and we're both off the rooftop and our medic started working on him trying to bring him back to life while we're another Marine was trying to keep me stable.

1077
01:05:01.24 --> 01:05:12.24
And so put some click a lot and different clouding agents in his neck and all of a sudden Rick kind of woke up and made like a zombie moon.

1078
01:05:12.24 --> 01:05:16.24
And it was like blinking and stuff. And so turned out fine.

1079
01:05:16.24 --> 01:05:24.24
And luckily today he's, you know, he's left the service, but he's about to graduate from college. He's in the body building and you know, he's doing great.

1080
01:05:24.24 --> 01:05:26.24
And she's awesome.

1081
01:05:26.24 --> 01:05:29.24
And so at that time he was pretty stable.

1082
01:05:29.24 --> 01:05:33.24
And I started taking a little bit of a turn for the worse because of both of the windup and my shoulder.

1083
01:05:33.24 --> 01:05:40.24
It also kind of punctured one of my lungs and so to have blood pulling in my, the left side of my chest cavity.

1084
01:05:40.24 --> 01:05:45.24
And so, guys were trying to get us out of there's new conscious.

1085
01:05:45.24 --> 01:05:47.24
I was, yeah.

1086
01:05:47.24 --> 01:05:52.24
Yeah, for the most part until towards towards the end where I started to fade a little bit.

1087
01:05:52.24 --> 01:05:58.24
And then did you, did you eventually just, did you pass out, they hit you with morphine? What did what they do?

1088
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:03.24
I didn't get any drugs until, I don't think I got any drugs until I got it in the helicopter.

1089
01:06:03.24 --> 01:06:08.24
And then, well, I was on the helicopter, passed out woke up in a hospital in Afghanistan.

1090
01:06:08.24 --> 01:06:15.24
But I do remember the event and so I remember making the radio call to my teammates while I was on the rooftop.

1091
01:06:15.24 --> 01:06:17.24
Remember getting pulled down.

1092
01:06:17.24 --> 01:06:23.24
Remember talking to Huffie's, one of the Marines who was working on me, talking them through a needle D.

1093
01:06:23.24 --> 01:06:28.24
As he was giving me a needle D, he was trying to tell him and talk to him and stuff.

1094
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:35.24
And he said, you know, he said, so, sorry, I said some interesting things while I was there too.

1095
01:06:35.24 --> 01:06:46.24
So just to give people a little bit of a visual on that, a needle D compression is when you're, when somebody's going to take a, what, like a 14 gauge needle or something like that.

1096
01:06:46.24 --> 01:06:53.24
And jam it in between your ribs into your lung cavity to allow some pressure out.

1097
01:06:53.24 --> 01:06:55.24
Then you had to talk him through that.

1098
01:06:55.24 --> 01:07:00.24
He knew what he was doing, but I was just, you know, just trying to encourage him into different things.

1099
01:07:00.24 --> 01:07:05.24
And at that time, I was also trying to relay information to help them find the bad guys and it was fine.

1100
01:07:05.24 --> 01:07:09.24
Who they were trying to return fire for, or against.

1101
01:07:09.24 --> 01:07:12.24
And so, was talking them on, trying to talk them on initially.

1102
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:19.24
And then after that, it was just trying to talk to him to make sure, you know, and then the helicopter just sat down in your compound.

1103
01:07:19.24 --> 01:07:20.24
No.

1104
01:07:20.24 --> 01:07:21.24
They couldn't.

1105
01:07:21.24 --> 01:07:24.24
So that was a big challenge.

1106
01:07:24.24 --> 01:07:30.24
And so, what happened and what Brian Jacqueline was awarded the Navy Cross for.

1107
01:07:30.24 --> 01:07:34.24
And a lot of other guys who all risked their lives to save ours.

1108
01:07:34.24 --> 01:07:41.24
Did was they had to call the helicopters out into an open field, despite being under fire.

1109
01:07:41.24 --> 01:07:45.24
And so they prep the area with as much air support as they could, called in the bird.

1110
01:07:45.24 --> 01:07:47.24
And the bird landed.

1111
01:07:47.24 --> 01:07:50.24
Brian blew a breach in the compound wall through smoke.

1112
01:07:50.24 --> 01:07:55.24
And then literally what he said was, if you get hit on the way to the chopper, jump in, follow me, and let the way.

1113
01:07:55.24 --> 01:08:00.24
And without hesitation, the other guys carried us out with the open.

1114
01:08:00.24 --> 01:08:02.24
And I'm not a small guy.

1115
01:08:02.24 --> 01:08:09.24
You know, I'm 200 pounds of barrel chest and freedom fighter just like most of us with a lot of kid on to.

1116
01:08:09.24 --> 01:08:15.24
And so, those guys carrying us out there, we're in a polis litter.

1117
01:08:15.24 --> 01:08:18.24
And so, to carry us, it takes four guys and they can't return fire.

1118
01:08:18.24 --> 01:08:22.24
And they can't pick up their weapon and engage the enemy.

1119
01:08:22.24 --> 01:08:24.24
So they're totally exposed.

1120
01:08:24.24 --> 01:08:28.24
And without hesitation, right out there and doing the bullet dance,

1121
01:08:28.24 --> 01:08:30.24
dodge and bullets trying to get us on the bird and get us out of there.

1122
01:08:30.24 --> 01:08:32.24
And I'm alive today because of that.

1123
01:08:32.24 --> 01:08:38.24
And so, that for me, what I tell people when I talk about this is, is one of the best days of my life.

1124
01:08:38.24 --> 01:08:42.24
And so, you know, I was one of the worst days of my life too, because I, you know,

1125
01:08:42.24 --> 01:08:47.24
suffered this spinal cord injury and was paralyzed from the chest down for however long.

1126
01:08:47.24 --> 01:08:49.24
However long that may be.

1127
01:08:49.24 --> 01:08:55.24
But, also, my best day is my life because a team that I was fortunate enough to lead,

1128
01:08:55.24 --> 01:08:57.24
a team that I was fortunate enough to be a part of,

1129
01:08:57.24 --> 01:09:04.24
display the highest levels of selflessness and sacrifice and courage on the battlefield.

1130
01:09:04.24 --> 01:09:07.24
And just to put in some of that to be a part of that, you know,

1131
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:11.24
is something I'll never forget and something I'll be proud of for the rest of my life.

1132
01:09:11.24 --> 01:09:13.24
So, yeah.

1133
01:09:13.24 --> 01:09:18.24
And in case anyone missed it, the opening for this was actually,

1134
01:09:18.24 --> 01:09:23.24
those are gunnery sergeant Jacqueline's words that he,

1135
01:09:23.24 --> 01:09:26.24
that he gave during a speech and I thought they were just so,

1136
01:09:26.24 --> 01:09:28.24
they were just awesome words.

1137
01:09:28.24 --> 01:09:30.24
So, I figured I'd share them with some people.

1138
01:09:30.24 --> 01:09:33.24
And obviously, the rest of the guys, you know,

1139
01:09:33.24 --> 01:09:36.24
but bunch of kick-ass guys that, like you said,

1140
01:09:36.24 --> 01:09:40.24
I mean, just incredible heroism across the board from your team.

1141
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:46.24
And you now, and by the way, and actually,

1142
01:09:46.24 --> 01:09:48.24
and Jacqueline mentioned this in the speeches,

1143
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:51.24
well, there were some seals, like you said,

1144
01:09:51.24 --> 01:09:53.24
I guess it was the guys that were under you there,

1145
01:09:53.24 --> 01:09:55.24
guys from Ceil Team 3 that came in.

1146
01:09:55.24 --> 01:09:58.24
And I actually talked to one of those guys today,

1147
01:09:58.24 --> 01:10:01.24
because I knew, you know, because you were coming on,

1148
01:10:01.24 --> 01:10:04.24
and I just, I talked to him with Dan Crenshaw.

1149
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:07.24
And I just told him, you know, I said,

1150
01:10:07.24 --> 01:10:10.24
I'm talking to Derek today, and he's like,

1151
01:10:10.24 --> 01:10:11.24
that's awesome.

1152
01:10:11.24 --> 01:10:12.24
It was just cool.

1153
01:10:12.24 --> 01:10:15.24
It was just cool to hear the praise coming from Jacqueline,

1154
01:10:15.24 --> 01:10:18.24
and that's exactly the same thing that Dan Crenshaw said.

1155
01:10:18.24 --> 01:10:20.24
He's like, yeah, those guys were awesome.

1156
01:10:20.24 --> 01:10:23.24
That's just, you know, I said, I go, you were on that mission, right?

1157
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:25.24
He goes, oh, yeah, he goes, those guys were awesome.

1158
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:26.24
That's what he said.

1159
01:10:26.24 --> 01:10:29.24
And it was cool to hear Jacqueline say in the same thing.

1160
01:10:29.24 --> 01:10:31.24
And, you know, a lot of times, people get,

1161
01:10:31.24 --> 01:10:34.24
I guess people get caught up in whatever

1162
01:10:34.24 --> 01:10:38.24
is inter-service rivalry, and I actually literally have zero of that.

1163
01:10:38.24 --> 01:10:41.24
I, especially after my deployment to Ramadi,

1164
01:10:41.24 --> 01:10:44.24
I have zero inter-service rivalry of any kind.

1165
01:10:44.24 --> 01:10:46.24
Like, if you're on the battlefield,

1166
01:10:46.24 --> 01:10:48.24
and you have an American flag on your uniform,

1167
01:10:48.24 --> 01:10:52.24
you are my brother, and it was awesome to hear that feedback

1168
01:10:52.24 --> 01:10:54.24
from both those guys.

1169
01:10:54.24 --> 01:10:59.24
You wake up in hospital.

1170
01:10:59.24 --> 01:11:02.24
And you're in an African, you're in a hospital, Afghanistan.

1171
01:11:02.24 --> 01:11:07.24
Yep, wake up in camp, bastion.

1172
01:11:07.24 --> 01:11:12.24
Doctors there, and he's like, hey captain,

1173
01:11:12.24 --> 01:11:15.24
you got shot, you know, paralyzed,

1174
01:11:15.24 --> 01:11:16.24
and you may never walk again.

1175
01:11:16.24 --> 01:11:19.24
I'm just kind of stared on the same.

1176
01:11:19.24 --> 01:11:21.24
Yeah, I know.

1177
01:11:21.24 --> 01:11:23.24
I kind of had this awkward stare off.

1178
01:11:23.24 --> 01:11:27.24
I'm like, hey, anybody tell my wife it?

1179
01:11:27.24 --> 01:11:30.24
He's like, no, he's kind of stared as I mean,

1180
01:11:30.24 --> 01:11:33.24
and I'll go get me and goddamn phone.

1181
01:11:33.24 --> 01:11:35.24
Okay, yeah, got it.

1182
01:11:35.24 --> 01:11:38.24
And so, brings over the phone,

1183
01:11:38.24 --> 01:11:40.24
and I wake my wife up, middle the night.

1184
01:11:40.24 --> 01:11:44.24
So you were immediately, I knew that that was the case.

1185
01:11:44.24 --> 01:11:46.24
Literally the second I got shot.

1186
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:48.24
Because I tried to pick myself up.

1187
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:53.24
It's hard to understand if you never experienced it,

1188
01:11:53.24 --> 01:11:57.24
but if your body is numb and nothing works,

1189
01:11:57.24 --> 01:11:59.24
then, you know, and so,

1190
01:11:59.24 --> 01:12:05.08
Like, totally knew that that was the case and didn't know how long it would last, but I knew

1191
01:12:05.08 --> 01:12:06.56
that that was what the issue was.

1192
01:12:06.56 --> 01:12:14.08
And so, call my wife and woke her up, told her, you know, hey, I've been shot, paralyzed,

1193
01:12:14.08 --> 01:12:16.16
I mean, I've never walked again and I'm coming up.

1194
01:12:16.16 --> 01:12:22.96
And so that was pretty tough time and pretty fun, tough phone call to make, but throughout

1195
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:25.12
all of it, it was really happy that I was able to make that phone call.

1196
01:12:25.12 --> 01:12:29.12
Because a lot of guys don't get to do that.

1197
01:12:29.12 --> 01:12:33.20
And so, then moved on, got to back to Germany.

1198
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:34.36
It's been a couple of days there.

1199
01:12:34.36 --> 01:12:36.72
They didn't do anything.

1200
01:12:36.72 --> 01:12:42.28
From my condition, just kind of waited, transport back to Bethesda, where I checked in and met

1201
01:12:42.28 --> 01:12:45.80
my wife and family and they started to do some other surgeries, removed the bullet from

1202
01:12:45.80 --> 01:12:49.12
my spine and some other things.

1203
01:12:49.12 --> 01:12:55.10
And so, our guys at that time too were, they stayed put in the compound and they were

1204
01:12:55.10 --> 01:12:58.10
in thought for the rest of the day.

1205
01:12:58.10 --> 01:13:01.82
Repelled a few different enemy assaults and then as you mentioned, the seal team that

1206
01:13:01.82 --> 01:13:08.22
had come into to be the quick reactionary force for them came in at night and Jack

1207
01:13:08.22 --> 01:13:10.58
ended the turnover with them.

1208
01:13:10.58 --> 01:13:16.22
They came in to kind of reinforce the area and do some battle damage assessment.

1209
01:13:16.22 --> 01:13:19.22
And then that's when Dan had gotten injured.

1210
01:13:19.22 --> 01:13:24.86
And so, so the guys got now and the rest of our guys made it out of that day without

1211
01:13:24.86 --> 01:13:27.70
any further injuries.

1212
01:13:27.70 --> 01:13:33.14
And so, was in Bethesda and started my recovery process there with my wife on my side

1213
01:13:33.14 --> 01:13:35.78
and moving forward.

1214
01:13:35.78 --> 01:13:40.98
And that recovery process is, I heard you saying one of your other videos that you

1215
01:13:40.98 --> 01:13:43.70
have out there, you're just talking about the new normal.

1216
01:13:43.70 --> 01:13:47.98
Like, okay, this is the new normal, this is what it is and I'm going forward.

1217
01:13:47.98 --> 01:13:48.98
Yeah.

1218
01:13:48.98 --> 01:13:49.98
Yeah.

1219
01:13:49.98 --> 01:13:53.42
And the doctors were pretty non-committal.

1220
01:13:53.42 --> 01:13:58.74
So when I was there, they didn't say, you'll never walk again, they didn't say, you

1221
01:13:58.74 --> 01:14:01.10
know, what are you can or can't do?

1222
01:14:01.10 --> 01:14:03.82
They said, you know, hey, you have a spinal cord injury.

1223
01:14:03.82 --> 01:14:04.82
It's very severe.

1224
01:14:04.82 --> 01:14:06.18
It's a big deal.

1225
01:14:06.18 --> 01:14:10.22
But if you recover function, the research shows that it might happen in the first two

1226
01:14:10.22 --> 01:14:12.06
years, most likely.

1227
01:14:12.06 --> 01:14:15.58
And so that was good in some ways and bad in other ways.

1228
01:14:15.58 --> 01:14:22.98
It was good because it left me the opportunity to control my mindset and to say, hey,

1229
01:14:22.98 --> 01:14:28.02
so what, I'm going to get up in six weeks and go around a marathon or whatever.

1230
01:14:28.02 --> 01:14:30.70
The challenge with that though was that was a little bit.

1231
01:14:30.70 --> 01:14:35.22
That was good for me to get through those initial stages, but it was also naive of me to

1232
01:14:35.22 --> 01:14:37.98
not let the reality sink in.

1233
01:14:37.98 --> 01:14:41.66
And so, you know, when that didn't happen in six weeks and I didn't walk and I wasn't

1234
01:14:41.66 --> 01:14:47.50
gaining control or function of anything below my chest, that's when it started to get

1235
01:14:47.50 --> 01:14:51.78
real and like, was really challenging for me to deal with.

1236
01:14:51.78 --> 01:14:56.58
Because I didn't, you know, it was out of my control, the level of, you know, the permanence

1237
01:14:56.58 --> 01:14:58.46
of my injury.

1238
01:14:58.46 --> 01:15:04.14
And then what, what was there anything that helped you get through that transition of

1239
01:15:04.14 --> 01:15:09.26
when you, all of a sudden, six weeks goes by and you, the reality starts to hit you that

1240
01:15:09.26 --> 01:15:13.14
made you say, okay, here's what I'm going to do.

1241
01:15:13.14 --> 01:15:20.98
Yeah, it was, it was bad for about, I think probably, first four to six months.

1242
01:15:20.98 --> 01:15:23.70
And the reason why the, the reason why it was probably the lowest point, actually definitely

1243
01:15:23.70 --> 01:15:30.30
the lowest point was, I was 10 to the 2012, so about two months after I got injured,

1244
01:15:30.30 --> 01:15:34.42
I transferred to a VA facility in Tampa, Florida.

1245
01:15:34.42 --> 01:15:36.50
Because that was a major spinal cord injury clinic.

1246
01:15:36.50 --> 01:15:41.42
And so, the military, DOD side, doesn't have spinal cord injury recovery that have it all

1247
01:15:41.42 --> 01:15:42.42
of the VA.

1248
01:15:42.42 --> 01:15:47.22
So, which is me, in the VA with my wife, we really located there.

1249
01:15:47.22 --> 01:15:52.50
On that day, actually, that was the day that three other Marines in our company, the

1250
01:15:52.50 --> 01:15:57.94
front different team were killed in an insider attack in Sengen.

1251
01:15:57.94 --> 01:16:01.10
And so Captain Matthew and Newcune, Gunner, Sergeant Ryan Jetsky and Staff Sergeant, Sky

1252
01:16:01.10 --> 01:16:05.90
Mode, we're all three guys that weren't in my team, but they were friends of mine that

1253
01:16:05.90 --> 01:16:08.90
were killed and were coming home.

1254
01:16:08.90 --> 01:16:10.90
And so it was hard to deal with that.

1255
01:16:10.90 --> 01:16:12.62
It was hard because I was still in the hospital.

1256
01:16:12.62 --> 01:16:14.70
I couldn't go down into the funerals.

1257
01:16:14.70 --> 01:16:21.02
And then it was continued to be hard after that because it just reinforced the fact that

1258
01:16:21.02 --> 01:16:24.94
my guys were out there vulnerable, and I wasn't there to lead them.

1259
01:16:24.94 --> 01:16:25.94
And that was my job.

1260
01:16:25.94 --> 01:16:28.62
And I felt like I was failing them every day.

1261
01:16:28.62 --> 01:16:32.46
And so, although my wife was there with me, throughout this recovery process, it was lonely.

1262
01:16:32.46 --> 01:16:34.50
You know, everything you do in the military is in teams.

1263
01:16:34.50 --> 01:16:37.62
You're always from day one who can't be up a buddy for everything.

1264
01:16:37.62 --> 01:16:41.06
And now this was the first time in the military when I'm alone.

1265
01:16:41.06 --> 01:16:46.10
And without any control, over that will come of what would happen to my guys.

1266
01:16:46.10 --> 01:16:48.70
And so, that was tough.

1267
01:16:48.70 --> 01:16:53.58
That was like definitely, definitely the toughest part of the recovery process.

1268
01:16:53.58 --> 01:16:59.78
And so luckily, I was able to fly back to California and see them touch down in December.

1269
01:16:59.78 --> 01:17:01.42
All the guys made it back safe and sound.

1270
01:17:01.42 --> 01:17:04.10
And then that was really when I was able to start to put the pieces back together and go

1271
01:17:04.10 --> 01:17:05.78
forward and move on with my life.

1272
01:17:05.78 --> 01:17:09.18
What did that look like picking up the pieces and putting them back together?

1273
01:17:09.18 --> 01:17:12.94
And the reason I'm asking this is just because, you know, I'm looking at where you're

1274
01:17:12.94 --> 01:17:14.18
out right now.

1275
01:17:14.18 --> 01:17:19.42
And if there's any buddy that could be listening, that could say, okay, let me hear what

1276
01:17:19.42 --> 01:17:20.78
he did.

1277
01:17:20.78 --> 01:17:22.98
So I can emulate that.

1278
01:17:22.98 --> 01:17:24.26
Yeah.

1279
01:17:24.26 --> 01:17:31.94
The key things, there's a couple of things that I did that I think are, very similar to

1280
01:17:31.94 --> 01:17:33.66
some of the stuff that you've talked about before.

1281
01:17:33.66 --> 01:17:36.74
And one is mission and purpose.

1282
01:17:36.74 --> 01:17:41.78
And so recovering in a hospital sitting there by yourself, it wasn't the mission that

1283
01:17:41.78 --> 01:17:42.78
I signed up for.

1284
01:17:42.78 --> 01:17:46.62
And so as soon as I possibly could, I was back at work.

1285
01:17:46.62 --> 01:17:50.98
And so I was back in the op section in January, you know, as a few droprations officer

1286
01:17:50.98 --> 01:17:57.10
trying to do PowerPoints and slides and all the other stuff that officers are, are tasked

1287
01:17:57.10 --> 01:17:58.10
to do.

1288
01:17:58.10 --> 01:18:00.66
And it was great because nobody else wanted to do that stuff.

1289
01:18:00.66 --> 01:18:03.94
So I was happy to take it on and do it.

1290
01:18:03.94 --> 01:18:10.94
And so being around the team, providing something meaningful for them and having an impact

1291
01:18:10.94 --> 01:18:14.82
was more important for my psyche than anything else.

1292
01:18:14.82 --> 01:18:20.10
Other two things I've kind of looked at were like, very stoic philosophy, stoic mindset,

1293
01:18:20.10 --> 01:18:24.86
and realizing that something's out of my control.

1294
01:18:24.86 --> 01:18:28.98
But I do have control over the way I choose to react to things the way I choose to move

1295
01:18:28.98 --> 01:18:31.42
forward to my life and that I have opportunities.

1296
01:18:31.42 --> 01:18:35.10
The guys like Matt, Ryan and Sky don't have.

1297
01:18:35.10 --> 01:18:39.34
And so for me to squalend with that for me not to take advantage of every day and move forward

1298
01:18:39.34 --> 01:18:42.42
in a way that they would be proud of is a complete waste.

1299
01:18:42.42 --> 01:18:48.02
And so that makes it really easy to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to keep pushing

1300
01:18:48.02 --> 01:18:49.58
and to keep doing whatever you want to do.

1301
01:18:49.58 --> 01:18:53.06
And so those are the two things I think that every day, even to this day, continue to

1302
01:18:53.06 --> 01:18:59.26
push me forward is like, you know, setting out on the mission and the vision that I want

1303
01:18:59.26 --> 01:19:05.94
to achieve in the purpose for my life and taking advantage of every day because, you know,

1304
01:19:05.94 --> 01:19:06.94
it's an opportunity.

1305
01:19:06.94 --> 01:19:10.98
I have something that every day I wake up, I can go and create or do or build or make

1306
01:19:10.98 --> 01:19:17.74
something meaningful and to not take advantage of that is to squander an opportunity that

1307
01:19:17.74 --> 01:19:19.50
anyone of those guys would love to have.

1308
01:19:19.50 --> 01:19:22.02
So it makes it real simple and easy for me to do.

1309
01:19:22.02 --> 01:19:29.58
Oh man, brother, yeah, that's awesome, man.

1310
01:19:29.58 --> 01:19:30.58
That's awesome.

1311
01:19:30.58 --> 01:19:33.78
That's awesome attitude.

1312
01:19:33.78 --> 01:19:35.58
How long did you stay?

1313
01:19:35.58 --> 01:19:39.02
How long did you keep working in the Marine Corps for?

1314
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:41.14
Say it for about another two years after that.

1315
01:19:41.14 --> 01:19:43.54
So Marine Corps is pretty cool.

1316
01:19:43.54 --> 01:19:47.86
They have some programs in place for guys that are injured in the line of duty where you

1317
01:19:47.86 --> 01:19:49.66
can stay in.

1318
01:19:49.66 --> 01:19:53.46
So as long as you keep getting promoted and keep contributing.

1319
01:19:53.46 --> 01:20:00.42
And so for me, I didn't pursue those longer-term programs because I started to find some

1320
01:20:00.42 --> 01:20:05.86
other opportunities that I was passionate about and wanted to pursue outside the military.

1321
01:20:05.86 --> 01:20:10.50
And so I continue to work for about two years as a staff officer working with first, you

1322
01:20:10.50 --> 01:20:15.42
know, the operation section has were transitioning and trying to assign to mission sets

1323
01:20:15.42 --> 01:20:20.82
and supporting all those different types of operation, operational planning efforts.

1324
01:20:20.82 --> 01:20:27.30
And I'd gone back to business school part-time to try to learn about business and to go get

1325
01:20:27.30 --> 01:20:30.30
more education.

1326
01:20:30.30 --> 01:20:35.02
And then I became really passionate about a new opportunity and medical technology and medical

1327
01:20:35.02 --> 01:20:41.22
research and thought that that was where my next big impact would be.

1328
01:20:41.22 --> 01:20:48.98
And so decided to officially retire from the military in November of 2014 and have been

1329
01:20:48.98 --> 01:20:50.78
out since then.

1330
01:20:50.78 --> 01:20:56.10
And what was the new opportunity and where did that lead?

1331
01:20:56.10 --> 01:21:02.98
So the opportunity that a rose was to start a company and try to address issues and

1332
01:21:02.98 --> 01:21:05.10
unmet needs associated with spinal cord injury.

1333
01:21:05.10 --> 01:21:10.86
And so I learned firsthand how many challenges and how many issues there are in addition

1334
01:21:10.86 --> 01:21:14.14
to just being in a wheelchair that a lot of people don't see.

1335
01:21:14.14 --> 01:21:21.18
And so everything from pals, bladder management, sexual function, physical training,

1336
01:21:21.18 --> 01:21:24.10
osteoporide, bone density, and muscle mass, there's so many different things that are

1337
01:21:24.10 --> 01:21:30.42
challenges that are unmet needs of the people like me and the patient population of which

1338
01:21:30.42 --> 01:21:31.94
am a part of.

1339
01:21:31.94 --> 01:21:36.10
And so the idea and the company that we started is called spinal singularity.

1340
01:21:36.10 --> 01:21:37.54
And that's what we're working to solve.

1341
01:21:37.54 --> 01:21:40.42
So our first product, the first thing we're working on, which is in clinical studies now,

1342
01:21:40.42 --> 01:21:43.74
is a smart catheter for bladder management.

1343
01:21:43.74 --> 01:21:50.06
And so allows people to push a button and empty their bladder, which is currently much

1344
01:21:50.06 --> 01:21:54.66
more advanced and much more useful and functional than the current method of management.

1345
01:21:54.66 --> 01:21:58.54
And so that's what we've been working on for the past few years.

1346
01:21:58.54 --> 01:21:59.54
Yeah.

1347
01:21:59.54 --> 01:22:00.54
Yeah.

1348
01:22:00.54 --> 01:22:04.66
And as I was kind of reading about the stuff that you've been working on and even on

1349
01:22:04.66 --> 01:22:07.50
that item right there.

1350
01:22:07.50 --> 01:22:13.46
It reminded me of when my buddy, Jody, midit, came down to be on the podcast and he's

1351
01:22:13.46 --> 01:22:16.06
a double amputee.

1352
01:22:16.06 --> 01:22:19.02
But you know, I would see pictures of him walking around and he would do like he did

1353
01:22:19.02 --> 01:22:20.34
some big race up in Canada.

1354
01:22:20.34 --> 01:22:21.78
I forget what the race was called.

1355
01:22:21.78 --> 01:22:22.70
The amazing race.

1356
01:22:22.70 --> 01:22:23.94
The amazing race.

1357
01:22:23.94 --> 01:22:29.66
And he would do all this really badass stuff that I would think, hey, you know, it's all

1358
01:22:29.66 --> 01:22:30.86
good.

1359
01:22:30.86 --> 01:22:37.46
And when he came down here, I think I might have been the second time he came

1360
01:22:37.46 --> 01:22:38.46
down here.

1361
01:22:38.46 --> 01:22:42.10
It was the second time he came down here and we like hung out more because you know,

1362
01:22:42.10 --> 01:22:45.14
he came down for a little bit more time and we were a little bit tighter.

1363
01:22:45.14 --> 01:22:51.50
But he, well, first of all, I got him a hotel room and he called me and he said, hey,

1364
01:22:51.50 --> 01:22:55.30
I'm not going to say it that hotel because they don't have a, you know, handicapped stuff

1365
01:22:55.30 --> 01:22:56.30
there.

1366
01:22:56.30 --> 01:22:59.86
And I was like, kind of, I was like, okay, yeah, man, cool, you know, whatever.

1367
01:22:59.86 --> 01:23:04.22
But in my mind, I was kind of thinking to myself, like, why did he need that?

1368
01:23:04.22 --> 01:23:08.98
Because I see him walking around and he's running the damn amazing race, right?

1369
01:23:08.98 --> 01:23:10.98
And so I asked him, how's that going?

1370
01:23:10.98 --> 01:23:12.46
You know, like later, I didn't ask him on the phone.

1371
01:23:12.46 --> 01:23:14.10
I said, yeah, I could whatever you want.

1372
01:23:14.10 --> 01:23:17.46
And then later I talked to him, I was like, why do you, you know, why do you need that?

1373
01:23:17.46 --> 01:23:19.18
I wasn't trying to be a jerk.

1374
01:23:19.18 --> 01:23:21.82
I was just honestly asking.

1375
01:23:21.82 --> 01:23:26.10
And he was like, yeah, well, you know, like at night, I mean, I, I take my legs off and

1376
01:23:26.10 --> 01:23:28.94
I got a crawl around and if I got to pull myself up on the toilet, I got to pull

1377
01:23:28.94 --> 01:23:34.18
myself in the shower and like if there's not handles and stuff, you know, it sucks.

1378
01:23:34.18 --> 01:23:37.78
And so that was like part one of this story.

1379
01:23:37.78 --> 01:23:43.22
Part two was he wanted to walk around and say, yeah, go on, you know, see what I lived and

1380
01:23:43.22 --> 01:23:44.94
go to the ocean and all this kind of stuff.

1381
01:23:44.94 --> 01:23:47.30
And so we did that.

1382
01:23:47.30 --> 01:23:52.34
And we had gone to the midway, aircraft carrier and walked around there and then we

1383
01:23:52.34 --> 01:23:56.06
walked downtown and then we walked, we were, then we went to where I live and we were

1384
01:23:56.06 --> 01:23:57.90
kind of like walking in the beach area.

1385
01:23:57.90 --> 01:24:00.62
And I could see who's kind of like slowing down.

1386
01:24:00.62 --> 01:24:04.66
And I could see his face getting a little bit, you know, like, like a little bit of a

1387
01:24:04.66 --> 01:24:06.66
little bit of strain in his face.

1388
01:24:06.66 --> 01:24:10.18
And he's like, hey, man, let me sit down for a minute and then he beats it down and we

1389
01:24:10.18 --> 01:24:11.66
talk a little bit and then he'd say, okay, let's go.

1390
01:24:11.66 --> 01:24:16.06
And then he'd say, let's let's sit down and find these, okay, man, can we just go back

1391
01:24:16.06 --> 01:24:17.06
to your house?

1392
01:24:17.06 --> 01:24:20.34
Like my legs are really hurting and, you know, like, yeah, guess what?

1393
01:24:20.34 --> 01:24:25.62
You're putting all that pressure on, on their stumps and, and it wears away the skin

1394
01:24:25.62 --> 01:24:31.10
and it's, it's, you know, it's hard and it sucks.

1395
01:24:31.10 --> 01:24:39.14
And I guess, so that's part number two and what these two things reinforced to me is, you

1396
01:24:39.14 --> 01:24:45.18
know, what, like, there's so much going on that, that I don't see that, that, because

1397
01:24:45.18 --> 01:24:47.14
you know, I hadn't been injured like that.

1398
01:24:47.14 --> 01:24:50.54
There's so many things going on that, like, oh, you know, he's doing okay.

1399
01:24:50.54 --> 01:24:51.94
It's like, yeah, he's doing okay.

1400
01:24:51.94 --> 01:24:56.14
He's seen him for like two hours, three hours, he's living like that 24 hours, he's got

1401
01:24:56.14 --> 01:25:00.70
all these things to contend with that haven't even remotely crossed my mind.

1402
01:25:00.70 --> 01:25:07.38
And so when I saw the, yeah, I mean, straight up, the first time I ever, it ever entered

1403
01:25:07.38 --> 01:25:12.70
my mind, how you take a piss, how you would take a piss.

1404
01:25:12.70 --> 01:25:16.22
The first time it ever entered my mind when I was researching what your medical devices are

1405
01:25:16.22 --> 01:25:22.78
and I was like, you know, how ignorant am I, you know, to be sitting here and never even

1406
01:25:22.78 --> 01:25:23.78
thought of that.

1407
01:25:23.78 --> 01:25:29.02
And then that's one of all these other problems that you have to contend with on a daily

1408
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:30.02
basis.

1409
01:25:30.02 --> 01:25:33.06
And it's, you know, it's a daily, it's a daily struggle.

1410
01:25:33.06 --> 01:25:36.66
You know, something, something gym web brought up as well.

1411
01:25:36.66 --> 01:25:39.50
He was talking about different types of courage.

1412
01:25:39.50 --> 01:25:41.90
And he brought up something called daily courage.

1413
01:25:41.90 --> 01:25:44.02
And he's talked about one of his friends that was wounded.

1414
01:25:44.02 --> 01:25:47.22
And he's like, every day, it takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed.

1415
01:25:47.22 --> 01:25:51.26
It takes him 15 minutes to get here and, you know, to the other side of his room, he's like,

1416
01:25:51.26 --> 01:25:54.18
that's daily courage that he has to show.

1417
01:25:54.18 --> 01:25:56.38
And I'm thinking of myself, yep.

1418
01:25:56.38 --> 01:26:01.94
And, you know, it just makes me feel like there's so much, there's so much more that,

1419
01:26:01.94 --> 01:26:08.98
you know, you go through on a daily basis that we and me, I completely take for granted,

1420
01:26:08.98 --> 01:26:11.34
a completely take it for granted.

1421
01:26:11.34 --> 01:26:17.14
And so for me to sit here and talk to you and realize how hard it is for you on a daily

1422
01:26:17.14 --> 01:26:19.10
basis to things you have to go through.

1423
01:26:19.10 --> 01:26:23.74
And then to hear you say, like, yeah, but I'm glad I'm here on like my brothers who

1424
01:26:23.74 --> 01:26:25.58
didn't come home.

1425
01:26:25.58 --> 01:26:29.46
Yeah, I don't think anyone has any excuses really.

1426
01:26:29.46 --> 01:26:30.46
None.

1427
01:26:30.46 --> 01:26:32.46
So, yeah.

1428
01:26:32.46 --> 01:26:34.26
Totally agree.

1429
01:26:34.26 --> 01:26:35.26
Yeah.

1430
01:26:35.26 --> 01:26:41.30
And just makes you do the deal that much more creative with your mindset.

1431
01:26:41.30 --> 01:26:42.30
Right.

1432
01:26:42.30 --> 01:26:46.30
Like, you look at all the challenges, but you've got to also look at the opportunities,

1433
01:26:46.30 --> 01:26:47.30
right?

1434
01:26:47.30 --> 01:26:51.30
So, I can sprint through airports much faster than you can with that.

1435
01:26:51.30 --> 01:26:52.30
I'm just getting into stress.

1436
01:26:52.30 --> 01:26:54.30
Like, I've got good parking most of the time, you know.

1437
01:26:54.30 --> 01:26:57.86
So you've just got to make up time where you can, it takes a little bit longer to get

1438
01:26:57.86 --> 01:27:02.30
off the airplane, but kill you on the straightaways any day.

1439
01:27:02.30 --> 01:27:06.30
And so, you know, you've just got to take the go the bad.

1440
01:27:06.30 --> 01:27:07.30
Yeah.

1441
01:27:07.30 --> 01:27:10.30
So, but, you know, it's, it's not so much choices.

1442
01:27:10.30 --> 01:27:16.30
So that was the, that was the, you got your MBA.

1443
01:27:16.30 --> 01:27:20.30
As, is that why you were still in you wouldn't you got your MBA?

1444
01:27:20.30 --> 01:27:21.30
Or did you get out?

1445
01:27:21.30 --> 01:27:22.30
I got out about halfway through.

1446
01:27:22.30 --> 01:27:25.30
So, I did the part-time program at UCLA.

1447
01:27:25.30 --> 01:27:26.30
It's an executive MBA.

1448
01:27:26.30 --> 01:27:27.30
So it's on the weekends.

1449
01:27:27.30 --> 01:27:28.30
Mm-hmm.

1450
01:27:28.30 --> 01:27:29.30
Every other weekend.

1451
01:27:29.30 --> 01:27:32.30
And so, as I was leaving the military.

1452
01:27:32.30 --> 01:27:34.30
So, I did the first year of still full, on active duty.

1453
01:27:34.30 --> 01:27:37.30
And then retired shortly out into the second year.

1454
01:27:37.30 --> 01:27:39.30
Took another job, another medical device.

1455
01:27:39.30 --> 01:27:40.30
Started up to get some experience.

1456
01:27:40.30 --> 01:27:44.30
And then as soon as I graduated, started full-time working on spinal singularity

1457
01:27:44.30 --> 01:27:45.30
in my company.

1458
01:27:45.30 --> 01:27:52.30
And so, one of the experiences too that was really cool that I had as part of that retirement

1459
01:27:52.30 --> 01:27:58.30
as I think about it now was being able to use and be involved in as a user, exoskeleton

1460
01:27:58.30 --> 01:27:59.30
technology.

1461
01:27:59.30 --> 01:28:04.30
And so, there's robotic exoskeleton technology that allows paraplegics to stand and walk.

1462
01:28:04.30 --> 01:28:05.30
Mm-hmm.

1463
01:28:05.30 --> 01:28:12.30
Um, because of a lot of generous donors in the brain-radar foundation, I was able to be

1464
01:28:12.30 --> 01:28:15.30
to use that device and to obtain that device.

1465
01:28:15.30 --> 01:28:16.30
Even before FDA approval.

1466
01:28:16.30 --> 01:28:24.30
And so, I had a really, really great setup within our batonine headquarters in our office.

1467
01:28:24.30 --> 01:28:27.30
And so, we had a physical therapist downstairs, smile,

1468
01:28:27.30 --> 01:28:28.30
which was upstairs.

1469
01:28:28.30 --> 01:28:32.30
It was fully accessible, which is not like most buildings in the military.

1470
01:28:32.30 --> 01:28:35.30
And so, I was able to use this device to stay in and walk and to do therapy.

1471
01:28:35.30 --> 01:28:39.30
And when our tired, I was able to use that device and not use my wheelchair to

1472
01:28:39.30 --> 01:28:43.30
relieve on my own two feet, which was a goal that had set for myself.

1473
01:28:43.30 --> 01:28:46.30
And so, that was great.

1474
01:28:46.30 --> 01:28:49.30
But it still didn't address a lot of these other unmet needs,

1475
01:28:49.30 --> 01:28:50.30
and then we had for the community.

1476
01:28:50.30 --> 01:28:55.30
And so, that was what inspired me to try to move forward on my own path and start

1477
01:28:55.30 --> 01:28:58.30
my own company and build this product to solve these issues.

1478
01:28:58.30 --> 01:29:04.30
So, yeah, so very thankful for all the donors and the foundation to help support that.

1479
01:29:04.30 --> 01:29:06.30
And I was also very fortunate.

1480
01:29:06.30 --> 01:29:10.30
So, like you said, a lot of other people had gone before me.

1481
01:29:10.30 --> 01:29:14.30
And so, one of my classmates at the Naval Academy, a guy named Matt Lambert,

1482
01:29:14.30 --> 01:29:18.30
got to first-marine radar batonine about two years before I did because he was on the

1483
01:29:18.30 --> 01:29:20.30
quick cycle of deployments.

1484
01:29:20.30 --> 01:29:24.30
And in 2010, he was a bilateral and PT above the knee.

1485
01:29:24.30 --> 01:29:28.30
As I was going through the training pipeline.

1486
01:29:28.30 --> 01:29:33.30
And so, I went up and saw him in Bethesda in the hospital and just checked him with him

1487
01:29:33.30 --> 01:29:37.30
over briefly as he was coming back and starting his rehab.

1488
01:29:37.30 --> 01:29:41.30
But this is maybe a week after he got off the battlefield or less.

1489
01:29:41.30 --> 01:29:43.30
And he says, you know, like, sort of you're going to do.

1490
01:29:43.30 --> 01:29:45.30
He's like, I'm going back to California.

1491
01:29:45.30 --> 01:29:47.30
He's like, no, I'm going back to Afghanistan.

1492
01:29:47.30 --> 01:29:49.30
Okay, gotcha.

1493
01:29:49.30 --> 01:29:52.30
I don't think like, man, how's he going to do that?

1494
01:29:52.30 --> 01:29:58.30
And sure enough, as I graduated from training, he was my company executive officer

1495
01:29:58.30 --> 01:29:59.30
checked me in.

1496
01:29:59.30 --> 01:30:01.30
And then we deployed again.

1497
01:30:01.30 --> 01:30:05.30
So when I had gotten injured and deployed, he was there as their company exo.

1498
01:30:05.30 --> 01:30:08.30
And then after my friend and Matt had gotten killed, he went down and took over his team.

1499
01:30:08.30 --> 01:30:11.30
As a bilateral and PT, above the knees.

1500
01:30:11.30 --> 01:30:13.30
And so, you know, he'd come back.

1501
01:30:13.30 --> 01:30:14.30
He had done that.

1502
01:30:14.30 --> 01:30:15.30
He had trodden that path.

1503
01:30:15.30 --> 01:30:18.30
And so, for me, you know, going back and recovering,

1504
01:30:18.30 --> 01:30:19.30
our building was accessible.

1505
01:30:19.30 --> 01:30:21.30
You know, it's a real terrible.

1506
01:30:21.30 --> 01:30:22.30
A lot of other things.

1507
01:30:22.30 --> 01:30:28.30
And then just that example that he said as well was really helpful and inspiring for me to follow.

1508
01:30:28.30 --> 01:30:36.30
And so, yeah, so really, really fortunate in the rehab environment, especially because of all the assets it's so come.

1509
01:30:36.30 --> 01:30:43.30
As and so if I'd been in the grunts, been totally totally different story for how the recovery would have gone.

1510
01:30:43.30 --> 01:30:48.30
You know, my entire command was super supportive of me coming back and working and doing this.

1511
01:30:48.30 --> 01:30:52.30
And whatever you need, whatever you want, you want to go to ops, like, sure, let's do it.

1512
01:30:52.30 --> 01:30:54.30
Get it up and so.

1513
01:30:54.30 --> 01:30:58.30
Yeah, so it's a good place to recover.

1514
01:30:58.30 --> 01:31:03.30
When you hear about, like, when you say broadly, like, if I was a grunt, I would have gotten that kind of support.

1515
01:31:03.30 --> 01:31:07.30
I mean, I get that because, you know, in this whole teams, we have the same thing like,

1516
01:31:07.30 --> 01:31:11.30
like, people will rally around and make stuff happen.

1517
01:31:11.30 --> 01:31:17.30
Is there anything, organizations that you know of that sort of support, like the front line.

1518
01:31:17.30 --> 01:31:22.30
Soldier Marine that gets that gets catastrophicly wounded?

1519
01:31:22.30 --> 01:31:26.30
Yeah, yeah, so there's a lot of different nonprofits out there.

1520
01:31:26.30 --> 01:31:28.30
Sumber five fund is a big one.

1521
01:31:28.30 --> 01:31:30.30
There's a lot of different groups that support them.

1522
01:31:30.30 --> 01:31:31.30
And, and it's different.

1523
01:31:31.30 --> 01:31:33.30
It's not that they don't have the assets.

1524
01:31:33.30 --> 01:31:36.30
It's just the location of those assets.

1525
01:31:36.30 --> 01:31:43.30
And so, an infantry battalion has a very different operational mission in leeway than special operations battalion.

1526
01:31:43.30 --> 01:31:52.30
And so, for all of the guys that were injured in the conventional forces, when they come back, they're immediately sent to wounded warrior battalion at the hospital.

1527
01:31:52.30 --> 01:31:54.30
And so their job is now.

1528
01:31:54.30 --> 01:31:58.30
Show up to your appointments and do your rehab until you get separated from the military.

1529
01:31:58.30 --> 01:31:59.30
Yeah.

1530
01:31:59.30 --> 01:32:07.30
That's a very different way to recover with a bunch of other people who are injured or on their way out, whatever else versus, you know,

1531
01:32:07.30 --> 01:32:12.30
and without an operational purpose, then what I was able to do, and I was very fortunate to do,

1532
01:32:12.30 --> 01:32:15.30
where I went back to an operational role within battalion.

1533
01:32:15.30 --> 01:32:22.30
And I was the only injured, one of the only injured guys, you know, recovering around normal people because I wanted to be like that.

1534
01:32:22.30 --> 01:32:27.30
Yeah, I don't know if you ever know a guy named Jake Schick, but he was on here and he told his story,

1535
01:32:27.30 --> 01:32:32.30
and that's like, that's what it was. He was there. He was just like his job was just to kind of recover,

1536
01:32:32.30 --> 01:32:41.30
but you could see and talk into him, he would have loved to have had some kind of a higher purpose than just that.

1537
01:32:41.30 --> 01:32:51.30
Which eventually he made, he made it from self. He made his own organization to, you know, help wounded vets and help suicide prevention with 22 kill.

1538
01:32:51.30 --> 01:33:02.30
But yeah, so I think that one of that's a good comparison, you know, just from hearing him tell his story about, you know, what his recovery was like, and it was.

1539
01:33:02.30 --> 01:33:05.30
It was geared towards, okay, you're going to do this until you get out of the Marine Corps.

1540
01:33:05.30 --> 01:33:13.30
I guarantee, you know, he talked to Jake Schick for three minutes, and you're going to realize if you could have told him, hey, we want you to do this for the Marine Corps.

1541
01:33:13.30 --> 01:33:18.30
He would have been all over it. He would have gone and done anything, you know, because he's a badass.

1542
01:33:18.30 --> 01:33:26.30
But, but yeah, I know that's a, that's a good point, and that's, well, you heard me say it because you kind of referenced it a little bit, you know,

1543
01:33:26.30 --> 01:33:30.30
I always tell guys that you need to find a new mission, whatever that new mission is, you've got to find a new mission.

1544
01:33:30.30 --> 01:33:41.30
You can't be sitting around with no mission, man. You had a mission for, for, for whatever eight years, seven years, 20 years, however long it's been, you had a, you had a mission, you had to go and,

1545
01:33:41.30 --> 01:33:48.30
if that goes away, you, you got to find a new one, and it doesn't really matter what it is. I mean, pick something good, right?

1546
01:33:48.30 --> 01:33:51.30
I mean, your mission shouldn't be, shouldn't involve whiskey.

1547
01:33:51.30 --> 01:33:55.30
But pick something positive and something good moving the right direction.

1548
01:33:55.30 --> 01:34:00.30
How, how is, uh, spinal singularity doing right now? Like, what's the, what's the status?

1549
01:34:00.30 --> 01:34:10.30
What do you really well? So, uh, it's been a good three years, um, I learned a ton, and just the fact that we're still in business today is, it's pretty amazing,

1550
01:34:10.30 --> 01:34:16.30
because I had zero experience, right? I had no clue what I was doing, because I know experience in medical device industry, I had no network.

1551
01:34:16.30 --> 01:34:31.30
Uh, and so the first year was a lot of, a lot of faith, a lot of ups and downs, right? Just like starting any business, but especially in the medical device industry, I learned a ton, and then it was fortunate enough to find people to bring in that, that are experienced, and then I trust, and so,

1552
01:34:31.30 --> 01:34:38.30
um, we've raised money, we've grown investors, we've raised, you know, money from grants and non-delute of sources.

1553
01:34:38.30 --> 01:34:53.30
Um, and we're at now, we have a small team of six employees in San Clemente, and, uh, running a large clinical study across the US right now, and so, we have sites all over, everywhere from Minnesota, New Jersey, you know, all over,

1554
01:34:53.30 --> 01:35:13.30
until the California and Arizona, and we're, those sites are actively enrolling people interested in supporting our trial, and then how long does that trial need to last before it gets approval? So the goal is to have approval, um, internationally next year, and then hopefully by the end of the year, we can have FDA approval for the product as well.

1555
01:35:13.30 --> 01:35:20.30
We're, uh, 100% certain that that's happening, but that's, uh, that's the goal, and hopefully we can collect the data we need as quickly as possible to accomplish that.

1556
01:35:20.30 --> 01:35:24.30
And then do you have your next device in mind after this one goes live?

1557
01:35:24.30 --> 01:35:35.30
Got ideas? You got it. Yeah, but, uh, I'm always, I've always been like a versatile guy, not like the, you know, execution like the 100% I'm the zero to 90% guy, not the 90%

1558
01:35:35.30 --> 01:35:48.30
100% of the money. Oh, guy. And so I know that, so everybody else that we were, you know, everybody else in our team now are like the 90 to 100% guys, and so, um, I'm trying to be more like that, and not even think about it, because if, if this doesn't work, got it.

1559
01:35:48.30 --> 01:36:00.30
There is no business, right? Like we've put all of our, you know, this is what we raised money to do, you know, we haven't, we don't, we can't knowingly devote a minute of time to anything else until this is successful.

1560
01:36:00.30 --> 01:36:12.30
So you're going to do that with that, then we can kind of go back and drawing more things, but, and once it's approved here, then it just, then it's just sailing it, selling it and getting it out there, and it's going into the, yeah, into the world.

1561
01:36:12.30 --> 01:36:41.30
And then what about the, what about the marine radar foundation, which is another thing you're involved with? Yeah, so, um, after I was injured, I was very ignorant to the realities of the way things work and what the needs would be for me. And so, um, a lot of nonprofits out there do all kinds of great work and different things, as a marine radar in this situation without knowing anything, you know, I didn't want to talk to anybody. I was very hesitant to reach out for help to anybody.

1562
01:36:41.30 --> 01:37:00.30
And so, as these things arose, you know, one of the guys who is, or was, is it, employee of the organization now, and so it was a currently an active duty radar at that time, it was like, hey man, like, we're starting this nonprofit to help guys, like, if you need anything to say, say so. And so it was like, all right, cool.

1563
01:37:00.30 --> 01:37:13.30
And so they helped pay for my wife to move out to Tampa, so she could be there for my recovery helped, you know, get her car out there, so she could drive around and help transport me around to different things.

1564
01:37:13.30 --> 01:37:21.30
They helped us raise money for the exoskeleton because it was still not covered by insurance or the VA, it was still experimental at that time.

1565
01:37:21.30 --> 01:37:33.30
So, you know, my wife and I are eternally grateful for all the support we receive from them. And so, as soon as I got out of the military, that organization said, hey, do you want to be a board member? Do you want to help?

1566
01:37:33.30 --> 01:37:39.30
I don't like, yes, absolutely. And so that was 2014 and so I've been on the board since then.

1567
01:37:39.30 --> 01:37:46.30
And I think it was 2015, I took over as a board president, and so I've been trying to devote my spare time to help that organization.

1568
01:37:46.30 --> 01:37:56.30
But the missions that we serve and ultimately what we do at the foundation is just to support on that needs of the community and their families.

1569
01:37:56.30 --> 01:38:07.30
And so the government's really good at supporting injured veterans and they have so many different programs that help people, but every situation is unique.

1570
01:38:07.30 --> 01:38:16.30
And so, Congress isn't going to change a law to appropriate money for you to not do something that doesn't fall into the black and white letter of the law. And that's fine.

1571
01:38:16.30 --> 01:38:23.30
But that's where we step in and it will help people and you know, take the stress off of them and their times of need.

1572
01:38:23.30 --> 01:38:29.30
So, have four real major areas, one is support to the marine raiders, another is family resiliency.

1573
01:38:29.30 --> 01:38:35.30
Third one is tragedy assistance and survivor support and then the last one is a radar legacy in preservation.

1574
01:38:35.30 --> 01:38:49.30
So, obviously the radar support and the family support are pretty broad ways to work and they can be anything from, you know, just anything on the song that will help Marines and their families.

1575
01:38:49.30 --> 01:39:07.30
And the tragedy assistance survivor support even though, you know, we're engaged in varying levels of combat there's still guys out there putting their lives on the line every day. And that's evidence by recent training incident that we had about two years ago, less than two years ago, 2017.

1576
01:39:07.30 --> 01:39:19.30
So, we're going to see one third crash that claimed the lives of seven marine raiders and then two years before that helicopter crash in another training mission out of the course of Florida.

1577
01:39:19.30 --> 01:39:28.30
That took another lives another seven guys and so, being able to support their their families and family members that had survived those.

1578
01:39:28.30 --> 01:39:42.30
So, the incident is a big part of the mission that we fulfill and then radar legacy in preservation just because they want one thing. You hit on this a little bit, but I'm just going to expand a little bit so people can kind of understand.

1579
01:39:42.30 --> 01:39:49.30
When you talk about like Congress is going to change a law to give a family that what they need a certain time because it's too specific or whatever.

1580
01:39:49.30 --> 01:40:01.30
And the reality is, let's say a kid needs a new bicycle and there's, you know, the dad can't go and get it because he's wounded, he's in the hospital.

1581
01:40:01.30 --> 01:40:08.30
Like, that's the kind of things that the foundation can do go out by the bite, get a built and deliver. You know, like little things like that that really matter.

1582
01:40:08.30 --> 01:40:16.30
And he can be bigger things too. Like you said, like moving a family, helping to pay for the movement of a family, helping to redec, you know, get furniture for the new apartment.

1583
01:40:16.30 --> 01:40:25.30
And what it is, there's no law that takes care of those situations, but these types of organizations do that. And it does have a big deal.

1584
01:40:25.30 --> 01:40:32.30
But it has a huge impact for those, for those families that are there and believe me when those families are in the most tough situations.

1585
01:40:32.30 --> 01:40:44.30
These little things to be able to not have them think about it, not have them think about, hey, the cost of a flight to fly, you know, dad out to come and visit his son or whatever.

1586
01:40:44.30 --> 01:40:51.30
And he, any of those little things they don't seem like a big deal, but they're a huge deal when families are going through these traumatic times.

1587
01:40:51.30 --> 01:40:52.30
Yeah.

1588
01:40:52.30 --> 01:41:06.30
So, for example, when my friend Matt was killed and his family went to go pick him up at Dover, one of the last, you know, things that his mother wanted was her whole family to fly home with him.

1589
01:41:06.30 --> 01:41:15.30
And the guy went to a only pay for the father and mother, I think it was. And so the other two brothers and some other family friends, they wanted to all be on the same plane.

1590
01:41:15.30 --> 01:41:24.30
One thing that she wanted to do, she didn't want anything else just said, hey, I want us all to be on the same plane going home while we're grieving with my son.

1591
01:41:24.30 --> 01:41:32.30
Yeah, that's that's in so instead of having to deal with that and the insanity of it, you know, just tell her hey, we got your flight for you to like get on the plane, you're good.

1592
01:41:32.30 --> 01:41:33.30
Perfect.

1593
01:41:33.30 --> 01:41:49.30
So, it's just a small seemingly small gesture, but with a timely injection of support can have a really lifelong impact on people. And so those are some of the different experiences and I can go on and on about different ways that we've been able to help people that.

1594
01:41:49.30 --> 01:41:57.30
Bottom line is, guys are going out doing these different things and for them to be able to go forward and to fly with a happy heart.

1595
01:41:57.30 --> 01:42:09.30
They want another family who are taking care of on the backside and the community will support them. And so that's that's literally it is we just, you know, we're 5133 that raises money to support the community members and their time of need.

1596
01:42:09.30 --> 01:42:11.30
And then the last one is legacy.

1597
01:42:11.30 --> 01:42:23.30
Yeah, so which is legit because you guys, I mean, you guys kind of are saving the legacy of the original world war two raiders, right? Yes, we're trying to. And so.

1598
01:42:23.30 --> 01:42:37.30
We explain how that, how you guys adopted the name because it's, it's awesome. It's a good history. So, so the marine raiders, the World War II marine raiders were one of the first special operations units formed.

1599
01:42:37.30 --> 01:42:49.30
Period. And so they were formed in World War II and their mission was to conduct enemy deeper kind of since essentially prior to invasions in the Pacific. And so these guys would mount up and rubber boats.

1600
01:42:49.30 --> 01:42:57.30
First ones to do submarine lockouts and, you know, and some of the things that they did were just insane even by today standards.

1601
01:42:57.30 --> 01:43:15.30
And so these guys were very well trained and basically provided the lineage of who we are today. And so those that group and then other members also joined the OSS at that time, which was the precursor of the CIA.

1602
01:43:15.30 --> 01:43:23.30
There's a lot of Marines at that unit as well. And those are the two kind of units that we draw our lineage from as the marine special operations units today.

1603
01:43:23.30 --> 01:43:31.30
And so these guys were disbanded in the 1946 after they came back or maybe it was in 1945 after the war.

1604
01:43:31.30 --> 01:43:44.30
And so we've been very active in connecting with these guys. They have an association that actually Colonel Kazinski is in charge of knowing the president of the marine raider association.

1605
01:43:44.30 --> 01:43:50.30
Which is a social organization, not a non, not a 5133.

1606
01:43:50.30 --> 01:43:56.30
And so a lot of these guys are still alive today, World War II veterans.

1607
01:43:56.30 --> 01:44:12.30
And so we get to go and meet with them and talk with them. And hear these stories of these amazing missions they did and conducting, you know, monthlong patrols behind enemy lines, sabotaging the Japanese and different, different battles.

1608
01:44:12.30 --> 01:44:22.30
And so these guys were very, very vocal and outspoken to different leadership within the marine corps as they're all, you know, in their 90s and passing away this day.

1609
01:44:22.30 --> 01:44:28.30
One way to honor our legacy is to have a marine raider, you know, have a marine raider unit today.

1610
01:44:28.30 --> 01:44:41.30
And that went over terribly with any leadership because, you don't know, there's a pretty strong culture and brainwashing done.

1611
01:44:41.30 --> 01:44:49.30
Within the marine corps and it's from day one, there's only one title of matters. It's at your a marine here. It's a wander is your a marine.

1612
01:44:49.30 --> 01:44:53.30
You are elite. No one is special or everyone is special and no one is special.

1613
01:44:53.30 --> 01:44:58.30
You know, you're all replaceable, but you're all special, which is the weirdest conundrum.

1614
01:44:58.30 --> 01:45:08.30
But all of us believe it and at the highest levels, a title of any unit, you know, the things you're special, you know, is against the entire culture.

1615
01:45:08.30 --> 01:45:22.30
And so since formation, since the marine special operations command was officially formed in 2006 from the force reconnaissance units overnight, they became the marine special operations command.

1616
01:45:22.30 --> 01:45:29.30
So literally changed the guide on at a ceremony and then they're officially so calm assets.

1617
01:45:29.30 --> 01:45:45.30
There was this undercurrent this push from the lowest levels. And guys were really strongly pushing this and so the raider symbol the raider logo from what we're to is it, you know, a shield with the southern cross and a skull and a dagger in it.

1618
01:45:45.30 --> 01:45:52.30
And so assuming the dagger's on there, we have the dagger for some of our units down just the skull and the southern cross.

1619
01:45:52.30 --> 01:46:05.30
And so guys were were patches and patches or another thing that they're my court patches. I know, beards anything that is not instructed here in it's with the uniform policy is not tolerated.

1620
01:46:05.30 --> 01:46:18.30
And so, you know, that's a quick way to get hammered right it's just like you're not special. What do you think you're doing? This is an authorized all that kind of stuff whereas the army's like, you know, army without hey, you know, I'm in the single team's man.

1621
01:46:18.30 --> 01:46:27.30
So the front points for flare, right? Yeah. So you guys are not. So embarrassing expected to have like to look cool right.

1622
01:46:27.30 --> 01:46:35.30
Within the Marine Corps, it was this consistent undercurrent pushing and pushing and pushing and so it's patches and then it became tattoos.

1623
01:46:35.30 --> 01:46:45.30
So guys would get the raider emblem just tattooed on their chest and then not where I've skippy shirt. So you just see, so like, you know, you're going into your first sergeant and they're like,

1624
01:46:45.30 --> 01:46:50.30
Where's your skippy shirt? Devil dog. What's give you shirt on? He's skippy.

1625
01:46:50.30 --> 01:46:56.30
And so it wasn't official until it was about two years ago, you're an half ago.

1626
01:46:56.30 --> 01:47:00.30
After a decade of insurgency. That's awesome.

1627
01:47:00.30 --> 01:47:10.30
The units that we have a name and I think it's directly attributed to Alvin Rook Raven actually. So within socom, he's a really smart guy, a phenomenal commander obviously.

1628
01:47:10.30 --> 01:47:22.30
And he gets marketing and branding and just the basic, you know, title right like you've earned the title of Marine and within the special operations community, you're in the title of seal and green bra.

1629
01:47:22.30 --> 01:47:29.30
And so he said, hey, my one of my last things I want to do like, I want to work with the com another Marine Corps. I want you guys to get a title.

1630
01:47:29.30 --> 01:47:31.30
Yeah, and it's right.

1631
01:47:31.30 --> 01:47:47.30
And it's, it's not even about marketing and brainy. It's about heritage and unit pride. I mean, what, what more awesome thing than to date and keep alive that tradition from World War II of those guys in the service and sacrifice that they had.

1632
01:47:47.30 --> 01:47:50.30
It's, it's badass man. It's awesome. It's awesome.

1633
01:47:50.30 --> 01:47:51.30
Yeah.

1634
01:47:51.30 --> 01:47:56.30
And as part of that too, you know, there's just like everything growing up right like we're growing up as an organization.

1635
01:47:56.30 --> 01:48:05.30
So we're new to Socom. So we're trying to figure out how to screw because we can. So we'd have our military special occupational specialty code. So that took a while till we had.

1636
01:48:05.30 --> 01:48:08.30
So guys, the rating is now for the whole career.

1637
01:48:08.30 --> 01:48:08.30
Yes.

1638
01:48:08.30 --> 01:48:09.30
Oh, that's awesome.

1639
01:48:09.30 --> 01:48:14.30
Yeah, because initially when they started, it wasn't the case. Right. It was like, well, let's socom.

1640
01:48:14.30 --> 01:48:21.30
Use you guys, but then we want to use you too. So every five years you're coming back to the fleet and you're going to be in an infantry company or rifle,

1641
01:48:21.30 --> 01:48:30.30
and stuff and they were like, guys, when I first joined the Navy, I've talked about this before. When I first joined the Navy, the Marines didn't have names on their uniforms.

1642
01:48:30.30 --> 01:48:34.30
Because they didn't need them because your name was Lance Corporal.

1643
01:48:34.30 --> 01:48:41.30
Your name was Staff Sergeant. And that's it. It was legit. I always had a lot of respect for that. But of course now they have them.

1644
01:48:41.30 --> 01:48:50.30
But I always thought that. But that shows you, there's like, let's slow, you know, there's a slow change in the Marine Corps.

1645
01:48:50.30 --> 01:48:56.30
I'm sure some people would say that it's not good, but yeah, it just is. It's just the Marine Corps.

1646
01:48:56.30 --> 01:48:58.30
Be green-wainy.

1647
01:48:58.30 --> 01:49:00.30
Here comes again.

1648
01:49:00.30 --> 01:49:01.30
Yeah.

1649
01:49:01.30 --> 01:49:05.30
It's good. And so we have an M.S. Guys can stick around.

1650
01:49:05.30 --> 01:49:13.30
We have a name. We have a badge now. We have a, like, a, like, a, you know, just like you guys have the Trident. We have a war Eagle.

1651
01:49:13.30 --> 01:49:14.30
Yeah, something like that.

1652
01:49:14.30 --> 01:49:30.30
I was just like a big Eagle and a giant sword. And so, well, the cool thing I did to cool that cool thing about the Marine Raiders and about the Marine special operations is if you're in the Navy,

1653
01:49:30.30 --> 01:49:37.30
and you're in the SEAL teams, like you have nothing. There's no cross, there's almost no cross over.

1654
01:49:37.30 --> 01:49:46.30
There's, there's almost no cross. There's one, there's 3% cross over from the US Navy to a SEAL team in terms of your skills, right?

1655
01:49:46.30 --> 01:49:53.30
You're, you're a guy driving a ship or working a big 16 inch gun or working on a missile technology.

1656
01:49:53.30 --> 01:50:00.30
That's what you do in the Navy. The SEAL teams, you're in and field of the machine gun. There's zero cross over. And that's horrible.

1657
01:50:00.30 --> 01:50:10.30
And in the Marine Corps, it's like, oh, you're an infantryman that totally, I mean, every skill is applicable. And that is such an advantage to the Marine Corps.

1658
01:50:10.30 --> 01:50:17.30
And it's such an advantage to the Raiders because you get guys that have fundamental infantry skills when they roll in.

1659
01:50:17.30 --> 01:50:29.30
We have to teach guys infantry skills. Once we've taught them sort of fundamental special operations type, small unit tactics, then we have to teach them conventional more, more conventional movements.

1660
01:50:29.30 --> 01:50:40.30
Just to get them up to speed because you got to know those things. If you're out working with 140 Iraqi soldiers, you can't, that's not a small unit anymore. You got to think a little bit differently.

1661
01:50:40.30 --> 01:50:50.30
So you guys have that advantage. And that's an awesome, an awesome thing. I mean, I remember the guys used to kind of complain about it when I was friends with a bunch of forestry, congrats.

1662
01:50:50.30 --> 01:51:04.30
They would always complain about going to be billets. Like, hey, I got to go, well, not a be billet, but they have to go back to an infantry platoon. And I would always think to myself, man, I'd go to an infantry platoon, or are you kidding me? Like, it's awesome. It's awesome.

1663
01:51:04.30 --> 01:51:17.30
And so I think that's an advantage. So if there's any young ones out there that are thinking about your future, think about the Marine Corps, because you get that full spectrum of kind of land warfare.

1664
01:51:17.30 --> 01:51:27.30
You get the amphibious side too, but you get that full spectrum of infantry. And that's awesome. And you don't, it's hard to get that in the sealed teams. You get it over time.

1665
01:51:27.30 --> 01:51:37.30
But I got, I see where I got it from. I got it from working with Marines on our deployments. And I got to see what a company movement looked like. And that's where I learned it from thank God.

1666
01:51:37.30 --> 01:51:43.30
Because by the time I was older, and then Iraq, working with the army and we're going to kind of had at least some semblance of knowledge about it.

1667
01:51:43.30 --> 01:52:00.30
Yeah, yeah, couldn't agree more. And one of the good things about that as well for us as an organization is, we don't have street to soft, right? There's a period of time. And so, you know, like, you get to assess people.

1668
01:52:00.30 --> 01:52:12.30
And one of the best assessments you can make for future performance is the past performance. And so if you've already got two to four years of observation in the Marine Corps, if you couldn't hack it in in a infantry platoon, then you don't really deserve a trial or make it to the special operation committee.

1669
01:52:12.30 --> 01:52:23.30
Those lessons learned you're absolutely right. It's exactly the same stuff. So if you, you know, like for all those young motivators out there, they want to become a Marine or become a Marsak, like, first step is just become Marine.

1670
01:52:23.30 --> 01:52:32.30
Be good, great Marine, whatever you do. You be an infantry, like, be great. Like be the best rifleman. You could be the best mortarman machine gunner or whatever else you can do.

1671
01:52:32.30 --> 01:52:38.30
Do they take any MOS? Yes. Okay, so that's awesome. So you don't have to worry about what your MOS is. You won't get withheld.

1672
01:52:38.30 --> 01:52:54.30
No, it's become a more and more competitive. And if you're smart, obviously, I mean, I always tell people just going infantry or kind of since humans, because, you know, if you want to be a radar and you want to go do those sorts of things, those skill sets are much more applicable.

1673
01:52:54.30 --> 01:53:04.30
It's better to learn them early and become a master of those as opposed to a master of admin or supply or anything else. So what's MOS?

1674
01:53:04.30 --> 01:53:14.30
Military operational specialty. Occupational specialty military. So it's like what your job is? You can be a rifleman. You can be a machine gunner. You can be a mortarman.

1675
01:53:14.30 --> 01:53:28.30
But you can also be a mechanic. You can be an IT guy. And you can be, I mean, there's Marines that are do every job. You know, every job that you can have the same thing in the army, same thing in the Navy, you know. And so that's why

1676
01:53:28.30 --> 01:53:38.30
it used to be in the Navy. You had to have certain ratings if you were going to go in the sealed teams. And so that was one of them. If they did the same thing like we only take guys from inventory.

1677
01:53:38.30 --> 01:53:47.30
Last thing I'll ask you about, because I know we've been here for a while. You got two sons and how's that going?

1678
01:53:47.30 --> 01:53:49.30
It's awesome. How will they?

1679
01:53:49.30 --> 01:53:54.30
They're awesome. They're almost 16 months old or 16 months old.

1680
01:53:54.30 --> 01:54:06.30
Also, you're just in the full get some stage. Yeah. My wife is awesome. So they can do a few things. So they can run. They can yell and they can throw things.

1681
01:54:06.30 --> 01:54:17.30
So when I come home, I just know that like she's been just getting run around and thrown at yelled at cried, you know, diapers like the whole thing.

1682
01:54:17.30 --> 01:54:27.30
And they're twins. Yeah. They're giants too. He's got a twin brother. Yeah. They're giants. They're huge. Is there like psychological things to watch out for with twins?

1683
01:54:27.30 --> 01:54:30.30
Like what? I don't know aren't they like hyper competitive?

1684
01:54:30.30 --> 01:54:32.30
Yeah.

1685
01:54:32.30 --> 01:54:38.30
Let me give you one piece of advice. I don't know not a twin. He's a twin.

1686
01:54:38.30 --> 01:54:45.30
Get your kids training to get to when they're really young because if you have a twin brother or even a brother that's close

1687
01:54:45.30 --> 01:54:49.30
in age, you're going to be really good at judzu because you have a natural training part of YouTube.

1688
01:54:49.30 --> 01:54:58.30
With all the time, they're the same size as you. And there are some kids out there that are just sick. And it's because they have twins.

1689
01:54:58.30 --> 01:55:06.30
I mean, I'm not just not trying to take away from them, but it's a huge advantage if you got it to when brother. They should be grappling.

1690
01:55:06.30 --> 01:55:12.30
Oh, a lot. I fully intend on that. So that's one thing we didn't talk about, but I love judzu.

1691
01:55:12.30 --> 01:55:18.30
So I got involved when I was a senior in high school. It just became like a judzu.

1692
01:55:18.30 --> 01:55:24.30
Yeah. So I did a little bit of wrestling and then I played mostly football in the cross.

1693
01:55:24.30 --> 01:55:29.30
And one of the guys I was a lifeguard too. And so one of the guys that came to my pool.

1694
01:55:29.30 --> 01:55:36.30
He was a correctional officer and got hooked up with some guys up in Philadelphia and started training.

1695
01:55:36.30 --> 01:55:46.30
So it was like me and a couple of other guys training in like a church gym. And so training there. And then when I was playing like Adamy, one of the things that I did to was try to start a judzu club.

1696
01:55:46.30 --> 01:55:55.30
I didn't even club there because it was it was just coming up right. I was like 2002, 2003, 2004. And so trained and then did a did boxing, did a little MMA.

1697
01:55:55.30 --> 01:56:00.30
And had a couple fights. And then like when I graduated became a Marine and was married.

1698
01:56:00.30 --> 01:56:08.30
But that was a good one. I didn't put it on hold. I got after it.

1699
01:56:08.30 --> 01:56:11.30
You did a boxing, fighting MMA fights. I don't know that.

1700
01:56:11.30 --> 01:56:15.30
Yeah, that's a lot. I always have guys go, well, you know what? Once I had kids, I got two kids.

1701
01:56:15.30 --> 01:56:21.30
And then they came and give me the look for approval from me. And my answer is I got four kids.

1702
01:56:21.30 --> 01:56:23.30
Yeah, yeah. Get some.

1703
01:56:23.30 --> 01:56:24.30
You already trained in anymore?

1704
01:56:24.30 --> 01:56:30.30
I'm not. No, I haven't. I trained a little bit in the Marine Corps. We did some companions and stuff. And I did all that.

1705
01:56:30.30 --> 01:56:34.30
But just focused on trying to be a great infantry officer. And so I got that.

1706
01:56:34.30 --> 01:56:38.30
Yeah. Yeah. I got a friend Max. Max is paralyzed.

1707
01:56:38.30 --> 01:56:44.30
Chest down. I would say. Yeah. He trains.

1708
01:56:44.30 --> 01:56:46.30
Yeah. He trains.

1709
01:56:46.30 --> 01:56:48.30
Has it come down and hook up with him sometime?

1710
01:56:48.30 --> 01:56:51.30
Yeah. His grip has gotten a lot stronger.

1711
01:56:51.30 --> 01:56:54.30
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1712
01:56:54.30 --> 01:57:02.30
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Jitsu is good. And with your twin boys, it's going to be real good.

1713
01:57:02.30 --> 01:57:08.30
Yeah, man. Look, we've been here. We've been at it for a while.

1714
01:57:08.30 --> 01:57:14.30
And then just just awesome. Awesome to hear you and talk to you.

1715
01:57:14.30 --> 01:57:22.30
We're, we're, can people find you? So where should they look? Twitter?

1716
01:57:22.30 --> 01:57:27.30
Yeah. I'm on on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, the usual.

1717
01:57:27.30 --> 01:57:31.30
Twitter. Well, that's a Derek Herrera.

1718
01:57:31.30 --> 01:57:40.30
Well, that's in there. In there's two ours in a row in Herrera. And there's a third. So there's a total of three ours in there.

1719
01:57:40.30 --> 01:57:44.30
And right out of the head out of the sea. But only one in your first name, right?

1720
01:57:44.30 --> 01:57:48.30
Yeah. Just one in the first game. Each year or a array of comments.

1721
01:57:48.30 --> 01:57:51.30
So that's a website. I've an updated the blog in a while.

1722
01:57:51.30 --> 01:57:54.30
I've been focused on on work and just doing that. And so spinal singularity.com.

1723
01:57:54.30 --> 01:57:59.30
I've had some other stuff we're doing, but Facebook, Instagram, all the stuff's public.

1724
01:57:59.30 --> 01:58:02.30
I don't put anything out that's not, you know, that's not private.

1725
01:58:02.30 --> 01:58:07.30
Really is to find me. So I try to answer all the emails and messages whenever else.

1726
01:58:07.30 --> 01:58:12.30
If anybody sends me notes, so not hard to track me down.

1727
01:58:12.30 --> 01:58:17.30
Awesome, man. And you and MarineRater Foundation dot org.

But yeah, that's great way to get involved. Awesome.

01:58:43.30 --> 01:58:46.30
You got me, y'all. And he closing thoughts.

01:58:46.30 --> 01:58:53.30
Yeah. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here and share my story with you.

1736
01:58:53.30 --> 01:58:56.30
I'm not here doing this to seek the limelight for anything.

1737
01:58:56.30 --> 01:58:59.30
I'm doing it to try to be a good ambassador of the guys that are continuing to go for.

1738
01:58:59.30 --> 01:59:03.30
But there lives on the line on a daily basis who can't talk about what they do.

1739
01:59:03.30 --> 01:59:08.30
I advocate for themselves. A lot of people to thank my wife and particular spend their

1740
01:59:08.30 --> 01:59:13.30
Formary stuff away. The foundation, the Marine Raider Foundation and all the people

1741
01:59:13.30 --> 01:59:19.30
associated with the organization. My team who said my life and wouldn't be here without them.

1742
01:59:19.30 --> 01:59:24.30
And all the guys that are out there continue to lay it down on a daily basis.

1743
01:59:24.30 --> 01:59:30.30
Awesome, man. Well, like I said, it's been an honor to sit here and talk to you

1744
01:59:30.30 --> 01:59:33.30
and hear your story and what you've been through in your sacrifice.

1745
01:59:33.30 --> 01:59:36.30
And be even beyond what you did in the Marine Corps or what you're still doing.

1746
01:59:36.30 --> 01:59:43.30
Building your business and with the foundation and most important.

1747
01:59:43.30 --> 01:59:50.30
I think is just to set this incredible example to this day of what it means to never

1748
01:59:50.30 --> 01:59:56.30
surrender of what it means to never quit and what it means to never give up.

1749
01:59:56.30 --> 02:00:01.30
Regardless of the challenge that you're facing, man. That's awesome.

1750
02:00:01.30 --> 02:00:06.30
So I appreciate the example you set for me and for everyone.

1751
02:00:06.30 --> 02:00:09.30
Thanks for coming on and sharing it a little bit.

1752
02:00:09.30 --> 02:00:11.30
Thank you. Pleasure to all of you.

1753
02:00:11.30 --> 02:00:13.30
Awesome.

1754
02:00:13.30 --> 02:00:17.30
And Derek has left the building.

1755
02:00:17.30 --> 02:00:20.30
Obviously, awesome to have him on.

1756
02:00:20.30 --> 02:00:27.30
And hear about his story. So echo.

1757
02:00:27.30 --> 02:00:28.30
Yes.

1758
02:00:28.30 --> 02:00:30.30
If somebody wants to support this podcast, how can they do it?

1759
02:00:30.30 --> 02:00:37.30
Anyways, we will. Well, actually, and I was meant to kind of add in when I interrupt.

1760
02:00:37.30 --> 02:00:41.30
But you know what you call it? Something de-e-de compression.

1761
02:00:41.30 --> 02:00:42.30
Needle down.

1762
02:00:42.30 --> 02:00:43.30
Needle down.

1763
02:00:43.30 --> 02:00:44.30
De compression.

1764
02:00:44.30 --> 02:00:51.30
I guess I should ask him that. But is that like, can you feel that? You know, like, when it goes in,

1765
02:00:51.30 --> 02:00:55.30
there's sticking a damn needle into your rib cage.

1766
02:00:55.30 --> 02:00:56.30
But you know what?

1767
02:00:56.30 --> 02:00:56.30
But you know what?

1768
02:00:56.30 --> 02:00:57.30
Into your lungs.

1769
02:00:57.30 --> 02:00:58.30
Yeah.

1770
02:00:58.30 --> 02:01:00.30
Remember, do you want to see if you can feel it?

1771
02:01:00.30 --> 02:01:03.30
I'll stick a needle through your chest.

1772
02:01:03.30 --> 02:01:04.30
Oh, yeah.

1773
02:01:04.30 --> 02:01:04.30
No, no, no.

1774
02:01:04.30 --> 02:01:08.30
I remember that movie three kings when they did that Mark Wahlberg.

1775
02:01:08.30 --> 02:01:09.30
Yes.

1776
02:01:09.30 --> 02:01:10.30
No.

1777
02:01:10.30 --> 02:01:11.30
They did that.

1778
02:01:11.30 --> 02:01:12.30
I'm pretty sure.

1779
02:01:12.30 --> 02:01:13.30
Okay.

1780
02:01:13.30 --> 02:01:14.30
Anyway.

1781
02:01:14.30 --> 02:01:16.30
All right. You don't want to talk about that movie.

1782
02:01:16.30 --> 02:01:17.30
Yeah.

1783
02:01:17.30 --> 02:01:18.30
All right.

1784
02:01:18.30 --> 02:01:19.30
Cool.

1785
02:01:19.30 --> 02:01:22.30
Anyway, yes. How can we support ourselves?

1786
02:01:22.30 --> 02:01:24.30
That's the question.

1787
02:01:24.30 --> 02:01:27.30
First way is to stand the path.

1788
02:01:27.30 --> 02:01:28.30
Keep working out.

1789
02:01:28.30 --> 02:01:29.30
Keep eating healthy.

1790
02:01:29.30 --> 02:01:30.30
That's the hardest one.

1791
02:01:30.30 --> 02:01:31.30
Mm-hmm.

1792
02:01:31.30 --> 02:01:33.30
Me and Derek were talking on a side note.

1793
02:01:33.30 --> 02:01:36.30
Like, eating healthy is kind of the hardest part about this whole stain on the path.

1794
02:01:36.30 --> 02:01:37.30
Good.

1795
02:01:37.30 --> 02:01:37.30
Good.

1796
02:01:37.30 --> 02:01:38.30
Could be.

1797
02:01:38.30 --> 02:01:39.30
Yeah.

1798
02:01:39.30 --> 02:01:41.30
I think because it's like, well, then again,

1799
02:01:41.30 --> 02:01:43.30
working out can depends on who you are.

1800
02:01:43.30 --> 02:01:45.30
Either way, you want to stand the path.

1801
02:01:45.30 --> 02:01:47.30
One of those elements of the path.

1802
02:01:47.30 --> 02:01:49.30
It's required now is you just to.

1803
02:01:49.30 --> 02:01:50.30
True.

1804
02:01:50.30 --> 02:01:51.30
You agree, right?

1805
02:01:51.30 --> 02:01:52.30
Yep.

1806
02:01:52.30 --> 02:01:52.30
What?

1807
02:01:52.30 --> 02:01:54.30
Anyway, when you do, you just see you're going to need a geek.

1808
02:01:54.30 --> 02:01:57.30
Go to origin main.com, get whatever geek you want.

1809
02:01:57.30 --> 02:01:58.30
Doesn't matter the color.

1810
02:01:58.30 --> 02:01:59.30
Well, no, no, no.

1811
02:01:59.30 --> 02:02:00.30
Check with your instructor.

1812
02:02:00.30 --> 02:02:01.30
Check with your instructor.

1813
02:02:01.30 --> 02:02:02.30
Get it out of my eye.

1814
02:02:02.30 --> 02:02:04.30
Check with your personal moral compass.

1815
02:02:04.30 --> 02:02:05.30
Yeah.

1816
02:02:05.30 --> 02:02:07.30
If you're going to geek, that's not white.

1817
02:02:07.30 --> 02:02:08.30
Yeah.

1818
02:02:08.30 --> 02:02:09.30
What?

1819
02:02:09.30 --> 02:02:10.30
So what do you mean?

1820
02:02:10.30 --> 02:02:11.30
The tradition.

1821
02:02:11.30 --> 02:02:12.30
Yeah.

1822
02:02:12.30 --> 02:02:15.30
You know, Pete consciously tries to, like,

1823
02:02:15.30 --> 02:02:19.30
you serve my personality.

1824
02:02:19.30 --> 02:02:21.30
By, he always, he won't give me a white.

1825
02:02:21.30 --> 02:02:24.30
He only gives me a blue geek, a black geek, whatever.

1826
02:02:24.30 --> 02:02:28.30
He wants to try and break me out of this tradition.

1827
02:02:28.30 --> 02:02:29.30
Yeah.

1828
02:02:29.30 --> 02:02:32.30
Which he's successful we don't, because now I have all different colored geese.

1829
02:02:32.30 --> 02:02:33.30
There you go.

1830
02:02:33.30 --> 02:02:37.30
But I wouldn't say that you violate your moral situation.

1831
02:02:37.30 --> 02:02:39.30
That's more of a style thing.

1832
02:02:39.30 --> 02:02:41.30
Okay, which violates my.

1833
02:02:41.30 --> 02:02:42.30
Yeah.

1834
02:02:42.30 --> 02:02:43.30
I guess so.

1835
02:02:43.30 --> 02:02:44.30
Yeah.

1836
02:02:44.30 --> 02:02:45.30
A little bit.

1837
02:02:45.30 --> 02:02:45.30
Yeah.

1838
02:02:45.30 --> 02:02:48.30
But I guess I can claim a small victory.

1839
02:02:48.30 --> 02:02:50.30
Because I can be like, oh, I don't care what color it is.

1840
02:02:50.30 --> 02:02:51.30
Right.

1841
02:02:51.30 --> 02:02:52.30
Right.

1842
02:02:52.30 --> 02:02:52.30
Yeah.

1843
02:02:52.30 --> 02:02:53.30
That's true.

1844
02:02:53.30 --> 02:02:54.30
A little more of a victory back in my direction.

1845
02:02:54.30 --> 02:02:55.30
Yeah.

1846
02:02:55.30 --> 02:02:56.30
Because it's not like you're sitting around.

1847
02:02:56.30 --> 02:02:58.30
Like, hey, maybe I should grab a green geek.

1848
02:02:58.30 --> 02:02:59.30
No.

1849
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:01.30
Because that'd make me, like, that'd be awesome.

1850
02:03:01.30 --> 02:03:03.30
I'm just opening the package from Pete going, oh.

1851
02:03:03.30 --> 02:03:04.30
He's going to be a blue geek.

1852
02:03:04.30 --> 02:03:05.30
Whatever.

1853
02:03:05.30 --> 02:03:06.30
Still, I'm wearing it.

1854
02:03:06.30 --> 02:03:07.30
Cool.

1855
02:03:07.30 --> 02:03:08.30
Thanks.

1856
02:03:08.30 --> 02:03:11.30
Oh, so yeah, get a game in whatever color you want.

1857
02:03:11.30 --> 02:03:14.30
After you check with the instructor and your moral compass.

1858
02:03:14.30 --> 02:03:15.30
Yeah.

1859
02:03:15.30 --> 02:03:17.30
Like, I guess.

1860
02:03:17.30 --> 02:03:19.30
Also, rash cards.

1861
02:03:19.30 --> 02:03:22.30
Biggest selling geek color is, you know?

1862
02:03:22.30 --> 02:03:23.30
Wait.

1863
02:03:23.30 --> 02:03:24.30
Nope.

1864
02:03:24.30 --> 02:03:25.30
Yes.

1865
02:03:25.30 --> 02:03:26.30
Come on.

1866
02:03:26.30 --> 02:03:27.30
We've had this color.

1867
02:03:27.30 --> 02:03:28.30
We had that conversation with Pete.

1868
02:03:28.30 --> 02:03:29.30
Everybody wants to be an engine.

1869
02:03:29.30 --> 02:03:31.30
Everybody wants to be an engine when they were little.

1870
02:03:31.30 --> 02:03:33.30
I didn't know you saying that's about the most selling.

1871
02:03:33.30 --> 02:03:35.30
I thought that that's like everybody wants to be an engine.

1872
02:03:35.30 --> 02:03:36.30
Yeah.

1873
02:03:36.30 --> 02:03:39.30
The geek, the ninjas had a black geese apparently.

1874
02:03:39.30 --> 02:03:41.30
I don't know what we just had geese.

1875
02:03:41.30 --> 02:03:44.30
They had little special shoes with the toe.

1876
02:03:44.30 --> 02:03:45.30
Right.

1877
02:03:45.30 --> 02:03:46.30
Right.

1878
02:03:46.30 --> 02:03:47.30
Oh, that's a nice cheese.

1879
02:03:47.30 --> 02:03:48.30
Yeah.

1880
02:03:48.30 --> 02:03:48.30
Yeah.

1881
02:03:48.30 --> 02:03:49.30
Either way, rash cards.

1882
02:03:49.30 --> 02:03:51.30
You got all swindrash cards.

1883
02:03:51.30 --> 02:03:52.30
Yeah.

1884
02:03:52.30 --> 02:03:53.30
Four no-ghee or four whatever kind of activity.

1885
02:03:53.30 --> 02:03:55.30
You can get t-shirts there.

1886
02:03:55.30 --> 02:03:57.30
And you can get supplements.

1887
02:03:57.30 --> 02:03:58.30
Jocco.

1888
02:03:58.30 --> 02:03:59.30
Yeah.

1889
02:03:59.30 --> 02:04:00.30
Those supplements.

1890
02:04:00.30 --> 02:04:01.30
Don't worry, fair.

1891
02:04:01.30 --> 02:04:03.30
For your joints, crilloil, for your all around.

1892
02:04:03.30 --> 02:04:04.30
Okay.

1893
02:04:04.30 --> 02:04:06.30
Yeah, man.

1894
02:04:06.30 --> 02:04:07.30
Discipline.

1895
02:04:07.30 --> 02:04:08.30
Yeah.

1896
02:04:08.30 --> 02:04:12.30
Get you get you in the zone, which J.P. sent me a text.

1897
02:04:12.30 --> 02:04:16.30
And he's like, how are you still saying gave Burke is the rep?

1898
02:04:16.30 --> 02:04:18.30
Oh, for that discipline.

1899
02:04:18.30 --> 02:04:21.30
He's more because J.P. is more disciplined.

1900
02:04:21.30 --> 02:04:22.30
Yeah.

1901
02:04:22.30 --> 02:04:23.30
And he's on discipline go.

1902
02:04:23.30 --> 02:04:24.30
Okay.

1903
02:04:24.30 --> 02:04:25.30
Yeah.

1904
02:04:25.30 --> 02:04:26.30
The kind of the way open the go pill.

1905
02:04:26.30 --> 02:04:28.30
The discipline go pill.

1906
02:04:28.30 --> 02:04:29.30
And he's all.

1907
02:04:29.30 --> 02:04:31.30
He sent a picture of.

1908
02:04:31.30 --> 02:04:35.30
Some like super high speed thing.

1909
02:04:35.30 --> 02:04:39.30
He's like, this is me on discipline go.

1910
02:04:39.30 --> 02:04:42.30
So J.P. is what he called jockeying for.

1911
02:04:42.30 --> 02:04:45.30
He was a slim goal representative position.

1912
02:04:45.30 --> 02:04:46.30
Yeah.

1913
02:04:46.30 --> 02:04:50.30
And he thinks Dave Burke because Dave Burke is sort of the OG discipline player.

1914
02:04:50.30 --> 02:04:51.30
Good deal to you.

1915
02:04:51.30 --> 02:04:52.30
Yeah.

1916
02:04:52.30 --> 02:04:52.30
Yeah.

1917
02:04:52.30 --> 02:04:53.30
He is.

1918
02:04:53.30 --> 02:04:54.30
Well, it looks face.

1919
02:04:54.30 --> 02:04:55.30
Dave Burke.

1920
02:04:55.30 --> 02:04:58.30
He's going to be perfect regardless because he's such a like,

1921
02:04:58.30 --> 02:05:03.30
like boom, high achiever dude from day one, you know, so, you know,

1922
02:05:03.30 --> 02:05:04.30
J.P. is a loose cannon.

1923
02:05:04.30 --> 02:05:06.30
So he can be the representative.

1924
02:05:06.30 --> 02:05:07.30
Well, he can be a loose cannon.

1925
02:05:07.30 --> 02:05:08.30
He's not.

1926
02:05:08.30 --> 02:05:11.30
He can be the representative discipline go because he discipline,

1927
02:05:11.30 --> 02:05:12.30
but he go.

1928
02:05:12.30 --> 02:05:13.30
He goes.

1929
02:05:13.30 --> 02:05:14.30
No, the point.

1930
02:05:14.30 --> 02:05:15.30
I think the funny thing.

1931
02:05:15.30 --> 02:05:16.30
You don't mean loose cannon.

1932
02:05:16.30 --> 02:05:18.30
What you mean to say, J about J.P. is J.P. is fired up.

1933
02:05:18.30 --> 02:05:19.30
He's fired up.

1934
02:05:19.30 --> 02:05:22.30
And what's funny is J.P. doesn't need to discipline.

1935
02:05:22.30 --> 02:05:25.30
That's why he's not the best representative because I'm like J.P.

1936
02:05:25.30 --> 02:05:28.30
We're going to be a more in the game.

1937
02:05:28.30 --> 02:05:29.30
He's in the game.

1938
02:05:29.30 --> 02:05:30.30
Yeah.

1939
02:05:30.30 --> 02:05:32.30
So, so J.P.

1940
02:05:32.30 --> 02:05:40.30
Well, we'll just give him a mutual supports supporting assets behind the discipline.

1941
02:05:40.30 --> 02:05:41.30
So yeah, you can discipline.

1942
02:05:41.30 --> 02:05:46.30
You can also get milk, mint chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla,

1943
02:05:46.30 --> 02:05:49.30
which is supposedly named after Dave Babin.

1944
02:05:49.30 --> 02:05:51.30
For what I understand.

1945
02:05:51.30 --> 02:05:52.30
And a darkness.

1946
02:05:52.30 --> 02:05:56.30
And other than the warrior kid, Mulk, Strawberry and chocolate.

1947
02:05:56.30 --> 02:05:57.30
Try those out.

1948
02:05:57.30 --> 02:05:59.30
Even if you're an adult, I hate to say it.

1949
02:05:59.30 --> 02:06:01.30
But I was thinking about this.

1950
02:06:01.30 --> 02:06:04.30
Have you ever as an adult, drank a strawberry, quick?

1951
02:06:04.30 --> 02:06:05.30
Yes.

1952
02:06:05.30 --> 02:06:06.30
Yes, you have.

1953
02:06:06.30 --> 02:06:08.30
I have big time.

1954
02:06:08.30 --> 02:06:10.30
Well, now we don't have to do that anymore.

1955
02:06:10.30 --> 02:06:11.30
Yeah.

1956
02:06:11.30 --> 02:06:14.30
Because now you can get something that's completely healthy.

1957
02:06:14.30 --> 02:06:15.30
What was the one?

1958
02:06:15.30 --> 02:06:19.30
There was like, that wasn't quick that they tried to skewer angle is healthy.

1959
02:06:19.30 --> 02:06:20.30
Right?

1960
02:06:20.30 --> 02:06:21.30
That was something that could be that.

1961
02:06:21.30 --> 02:06:23.30
Some other one, some other chocolate.

1962
02:06:23.30 --> 02:06:24.30
I never wanted that.

1963
02:06:24.30 --> 02:06:26.30
Yeah, forget it had to bite him.

1964
02:06:26.30 --> 02:06:27.30
And then the one.

1965
02:06:27.30 --> 02:06:29.30
Yeah, the working Mulk that's going to be the level team.

1966
02:06:29.30 --> 02:06:31.30
Oh, the, yeah, they might try and skew.

1967
02:06:31.30 --> 02:06:32.30
Yeah, that's the one.

1968
02:06:32.30 --> 02:06:33.30
Come on.

1969
02:06:33.30 --> 02:06:37.30
Go look at the ingredients and then compare that to Mulk.

1970
02:06:37.30 --> 02:06:38.30
Yeah.

1971
02:06:38.30 --> 02:06:39.30
You know what that stuff has it, bunch of sugar.

1972
02:06:39.30 --> 02:06:40.30
You know Mulk has it, Mulk.

1973
02:06:40.30 --> 02:06:44.30
To wreck from Mulk guys.

1974
02:06:44.30 --> 02:06:45.30
We're different.

1975
02:06:45.30 --> 02:06:46.30
A big it.

1976
02:06:46.30 --> 02:06:50.30
So yeah, get all that stuff from origin may not come.

1977
02:06:50.30 --> 02:06:51.30
Yeah.

1978
02:06:51.30 --> 02:06:54.30
Also, if you want to represent Jocco as a store, everybody.

1979
02:06:54.30 --> 02:06:55.30
Christmas is coming up.

1980
02:06:55.30 --> 02:06:58.30
This is what I'm doing.

1981
02:06:58.30 --> 02:07:00.30
I'm going to activate.

1982
02:07:00.30 --> 02:07:03.30
Hey, it's funny because I'm saying it like this is new thing.

1983
02:07:03.30 --> 02:07:04.30
This is such an old thing.

1984
02:07:04.30 --> 02:07:07.30
A gift card.

1985
02:07:07.30 --> 02:07:09.30
A gift card on JoccoStore.com.

1986
02:07:09.30 --> 02:07:13.30
So it's like, you know, like, okay, your brother or whoever.

1987
02:07:13.30 --> 02:07:16.30
Because it is like in the game.

1988
02:07:16.30 --> 02:07:17.30
I don't know.

1989
02:07:17.30 --> 02:07:18.30
Whatever your cousin.

1990
02:07:18.30 --> 02:07:19.30
Whoever.

1991
02:07:19.30 --> 02:07:20.30
And they're in the game.

1992
02:07:20.30 --> 02:07:22.30
They want, you know.

1993
02:07:22.30 --> 02:07:23.30
And you say, hey, you know what?

1994
02:07:23.30 --> 02:07:26.30
I can't pick out what I want for you from here.

1995
02:07:26.30 --> 02:07:27.30
You just pick out what you want.

1996
02:07:27.30 --> 02:07:28.30
Boom.

1997
02:07:28.30 --> 02:07:28.30
There you go.

1998
02:07:28.30 --> 02:07:29.30
Gift card.

1999
02:07:29.30 --> 02:07:30.30
Boom.

2000
02:07:30.30 --> 02:07:31.30
Nonetheless.

2001
02:07:31.30 --> 02:07:32.30
You know what?

2002
02:07:32.30 --> 02:07:33.30
I'm leaving this completely in your hands.

2003
02:07:33.30 --> 02:07:34.30
You know why?

2004
02:07:34.30 --> 02:07:35.30
I don't give gifts.

2005
02:07:35.30 --> 02:07:36.30
I don't like gifts.

2006
02:07:36.30 --> 02:07:37.30
Gift cards just aren't a thing for me.

2007
02:07:37.30 --> 02:07:39.30
I've never given anyone a gift card ever.

2008
02:07:39.30 --> 02:07:40.30
Yeah.

2009
02:07:40.30 --> 02:07:42.30
And so that's going to be your deal over there on your side of the track.

2010
02:07:42.30 --> 02:07:45.30
That's exactly what I was thinking when I was making it.

2011
02:07:45.30 --> 02:07:47.30
So I was like, this goes against kind of JoccoStore.

2012
02:07:47.30 --> 02:07:48.30
It's kind of JoccoStore.

2013
02:07:48.30 --> 02:07:51.30
So you know what I'm going to do on the gift card virtual representation.

2014
02:07:51.30 --> 02:07:54.30
I'm going to put your face right in the middle of it.

2015
02:07:54.30 --> 02:07:55.30
Boom.

2016
02:07:55.30 --> 02:07:56.30
So that's what I did.

2017
02:07:56.30 --> 02:07:57.30
So there you go.

2018
02:07:57.30 --> 02:07:58.30
You know, on it.

2019
02:07:58.30 --> 02:08:00.30
So it's kind of like, yeah, it's a gift card, but it's kind of from Jocco.

2020
02:08:00.30 --> 02:08:01.30
Since you don't give gifts.

2021
02:08:01.30 --> 02:08:02.30
Boom.

2022
02:08:02.30 --> 02:08:03.30
Now you do it.

2023
02:08:03.30 --> 02:08:04.30
Okay.

2024
02:08:04.30 --> 02:08:05.30
There you go.

2025
02:08:05.30 --> 02:08:06.30
Anyway, on there there's some good shirts.

2026
02:08:06.30 --> 02:08:08.30
You want to represent this political freedom.

2027
02:08:08.30 --> 02:08:12.30
You know, any kind of, I should say philosophy in the path.

2028
02:08:12.30 --> 02:08:13.30
Some good stuff on there.

2029
02:08:13.30 --> 02:08:15.30
Some rash cards as well.

2030
02:08:15.30 --> 02:08:16.30
And hoodies.

2031
02:08:16.30 --> 02:08:17.30
Tank tops.

2032
02:08:17.30 --> 02:08:18.30
I know it's winter.

2033
02:08:18.30 --> 02:08:19.30
I dig it.

2034
02:08:19.30 --> 02:08:25.50
But if you're in Honolulu, Pearl Harbor, wherever you can store, represent the tank top this

2035
02:08:25.50 --> 02:08:26.50
time of year.

2036
02:08:26.50 --> 02:08:28.10
But yeah, a lot of good stuff on there.

2037
02:08:28.10 --> 02:08:29.10
JoccoStore.

2038
02:08:29.10 --> 02:08:30.10
Dot com.

2039
02:08:30.10 --> 02:08:31.10
Defkers stuff.

2040
02:08:31.10 --> 02:08:32.10
Do the core.

2041
02:08:32.10 --> 02:08:33.10
Also.

2042
02:08:33.10 --> 02:08:37.50
Also subscribe to the podcast.

2043
02:08:37.50 --> 02:08:41.90
If you haven't already on Stitcher iTunes, Google Play.

2044
02:08:41.90 --> 02:08:45.30
And Spotify.

2045
02:08:45.30 --> 02:08:46.30
I don't know.

2046
02:08:46.30 --> 02:08:47.30
It's in Spotify.

2047
02:08:47.30 --> 02:08:48.30
I barely know what it is.

2048
02:08:48.30 --> 02:08:49.30
But I hear good things.

2049
02:08:49.30 --> 02:08:52.30
And you know, we're on there.

2050
02:08:52.30 --> 02:08:55.30
That's where Spotify play like mixed tapes.

2051
02:08:55.30 --> 02:08:57.30
Is that the theory behind it?

2052
02:08:57.30 --> 02:08:58.30
I don't know.

2053
02:08:58.30 --> 02:08:59.30
Yeah, I don't know either.

2054
02:08:59.30 --> 02:09:01.30
But you can get the podcast there as well.

2055
02:09:01.30 --> 02:09:02.30
Yes, you can.

2056
02:09:02.30 --> 02:09:03.30
Yeah.

2057
02:09:03.30 --> 02:09:05.30
You know, you can ask Alexa for the podcast.

2058
02:09:05.30 --> 02:09:06.30
Yeah.

2059
02:09:06.30 --> 02:09:07.30
Okay.

2060
02:09:07.30 --> 02:09:08.30
And don't be confused with that.

2061
02:09:08.30 --> 02:09:09.30
I think we went over this before.

2062
02:09:09.30 --> 02:09:11.30
Some people think that it's in Alexa.

2063
02:09:11.30 --> 02:09:12.30
It's not Alexa.

2064
02:09:12.30 --> 02:09:14.30
That's like saying, I have.

2065
02:09:14.30 --> 02:09:15.30
It's not an iPhone.

2066
02:09:15.30 --> 02:09:16.30
It's a Siri.

2067
02:09:16.30 --> 02:09:17.30
No.

2068
02:09:17.30 --> 02:09:20.30
Siri is the the the the girl inside.

2069
02:09:20.30 --> 02:09:24.30
Alexa's the girl inside the device called Amazon Echo.

2070
02:09:24.30 --> 02:09:25.30
Check.

2071
02:09:25.30 --> 02:09:26.30
There.

2072
02:09:26.30 --> 02:09:27.30
Anyway, yes, subscribe to the podcast.

2073
02:09:27.30 --> 02:09:28.30
If you haven't already and leave a review.

2074
02:09:28.30 --> 02:09:30.30
If you're in the mood.

2075
02:09:30.30 --> 02:09:35.30
Don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast, which I just posted a new one last week.

2076
02:09:35.30 --> 02:09:39.30
And it got a lot of really cool feedback on that one.

2077
02:09:39.30 --> 02:09:40.30
And.

2078
02:09:40.30 --> 02:09:41.30
Yeah.

2079
02:09:41.30 --> 02:09:43.30
I think once people got that one.

2080
02:09:43.30 --> 02:09:44.30
Because I don't talk about it.

2081
02:09:44.30 --> 02:09:45.30
I don't post very much about it.

2082
02:09:45.30 --> 02:09:46.30
But anyways, a bunch of people.

2083
02:09:46.30 --> 02:09:49.30
A bunch of people downloaded like all of them.

2084
02:09:49.30 --> 02:09:50.30
Yeah.

2085
02:09:50.30 --> 02:09:51.30
Because they're they're cool.

2086
02:09:51.30 --> 02:09:53.30
And they're good.

2087
02:09:53.30 --> 02:09:58.30
I believe the word is conversation starters with your children.

2088
02:09:58.30 --> 02:09:59.30
That's what a lot of people said.

2089
02:09:59.30 --> 02:10:06.30
Like, oh, I finally had the conversation that I needed to have with my kids about.

2090
02:10:06.30 --> 02:10:12.30
Well, in that case, Warrior Kid podcast number 19 about making good decisions.

2091
02:10:12.30 --> 02:10:13.30
Yeah.

2092
02:10:13.30 --> 02:10:14.30
And making bad decisions.

2093
02:10:14.30 --> 02:10:18.30
And now if you make some bad decisions along the way, you could ruin everything.

2094
02:10:18.30 --> 02:10:19.30
Yeah.

2095
02:10:19.30 --> 02:10:20.30
Yeah.

2096
02:10:20.30 --> 02:10:21.30
Totally.

2097
02:10:21.30 --> 02:10:26.30
And what's interesting about that one too is I have the supreme luxury of being able to listen

2098
02:10:26.30 --> 02:10:28.30
to all these while they happen.

2099
02:10:28.30 --> 02:10:29.30
These podcasts.

2100
02:10:29.30 --> 02:10:33.30
But on top of that, if I have a specific question for myself, I can just ask you.

2101
02:10:33.30 --> 02:10:34.30
Yeah.

2102
02:10:34.30 --> 02:10:38.30
But like, even though I might already kind of know the answer.

2103
02:10:38.30 --> 02:10:43.30
But when you deal with kids, you can't just deliver certain information the same way you

2104
02:10:43.30 --> 02:10:45.30
would as an adult or like your friend.

2105
02:10:45.30 --> 02:10:48.30
So I'm like, man, how do I approach this specific situation?

2106
02:10:48.30 --> 02:10:54.30
And the way that and the way you do it in Warrior Kid is the same way like you, you kind of

2107
02:10:54.30 --> 02:10:55.30
tell it to me or whatever.

2108
02:10:55.30 --> 02:11:00.30
It's that alleviate so much stress when like when you need to approach your kids with this

2109
02:11:00.30 --> 02:11:01.30
kind of stuff.

2110
02:11:01.30 --> 02:11:06.30
Well, one thing that everyone says is this is what I try and help my kids.

2111
02:11:06.30 --> 02:11:07.30
They don't listen to me.

2112
02:11:07.30 --> 02:11:08.30
They don't listen to me.

2113
02:11:08.30 --> 02:11:09.30
They don't listen to me.

2114
02:11:09.30 --> 02:11:10.30
They don't listen to me.

2115
02:11:10.30 --> 02:11:11.30
They listen to Uncle Jake.

2116
02:11:11.30 --> 02:11:17.50
Let Uncle Jake tell him what's what Uncle Jake speaks the truth and they accept it from

2117
02:11:17.50 --> 02:11:20.30
Uncle Jake oddly enough.

2118
02:11:20.30 --> 02:11:21.30
Yes sir.

2119
02:11:21.30 --> 02:11:27.78
Also, YouTube, if you were interested in the video version of this podcast, you're going to see what

2120
02:11:27.78 --> 02:11:28.78
Jockel looks like.

2121
02:11:28.78 --> 02:11:29.78
You're going to see what Derek looks like.

2122
02:11:29.78 --> 02:11:32.42
You're going to see what I look like if that's your thing.

2123
02:11:32.42 --> 02:11:37.78
If you haven't seen the two-minute trailer for the Mikey and the Dragons book, you can

2124
02:11:37.78 --> 02:11:38.90
get that on YouTube.

2125
02:11:38.90 --> 02:11:42.90
Which, by the way, is epic and I don't use that term lightly.

2126
02:11:42.90 --> 02:11:43.90
Yeah.

2127
02:11:43.90 --> 02:11:44.90
It's cool.

2128
02:11:44.90 --> 02:11:51.70
Echo sent me the for approval text with that video in it and I watched it and I wrote

2129
02:11:51.70 --> 02:11:57.02
back this is the best video I've ever seen in my entire life.

2130
02:11:57.02 --> 02:11:58.02
All caps.

2131
02:11:58.02 --> 02:11:59.02
Yeah.

2132
02:11:59.02 --> 02:12:00.02
Good.

2133
02:12:00.02 --> 02:12:01.50
And then I went read YouTube comments.

2134
02:12:01.50 --> 02:12:05.62
If I know one of us said Echo is Jack because you're not in the video, which is

2135
02:12:05.62 --> 02:12:07.74
supremely cool.

2136
02:12:07.74 --> 02:12:12.22
But no, what's cool is people are saying about a two-minute video, a cartoon video about

2137
02:12:12.22 --> 02:12:13.22
a kid's book.

2138
02:12:13.22 --> 02:12:17.14
People are saying that they got tears in their eyes, that they got chills.

2139
02:12:17.14 --> 02:12:19.02
It's a legit video.

2140
02:12:19.02 --> 02:12:20.02
It's awesome.

2141
02:12:20.02 --> 02:12:21.02
So yeah, you can get that.

2142
02:12:21.02 --> 02:12:26.06
If you go to the YouTube channel and then while you're doing that, you can subscribe

2143
02:12:26.06 --> 02:12:29.06
to it too to the YouTube channel.

2144
02:12:29.06 --> 02:12:35.62
Get the big subscriptions.

2145
02:12:35.62 --> 02:12:42.14
And then you can also get psychological warfare from iTunes, Google Play, MP3, whatever.

2146
02:12:42.14 --> 02:12:46.78
And that's me telling you to do the right thing and making you do it.

2147
02:12:46.78 --> 02:12:47.78
So just give it a shot.

2148
02:12:47.78 --> 02:12:48.78
You can do it.

2149
02:12:48.78 --> 02:12:49.78
Sure.

2150
02:12:49.78 --> 02:12:53.14
Also, when you want to vary up your workout, you want to add kettlebells to your workout,

2151
02:12:53.14 --> 02:12:54.14
get on it, kettlebells.

2152
02:12:54.14 --> 02:12:56.38
Go to onit.com slash jockel.

2153
02:12:56.38 --> 02:12:57.54
Some good stuff on there.

2154
02:12:57.54 --> 02:12:58.54
Look out stuff.

2155
02:12:58.54 --> 02:12:59.54
A lot of good stuff.

2156
02:12:59.54 --> 02:13:01.54
Good information too, by the way.

2157
02:13:01.54 --> 02:13:05.26
So go there onit.com slash jockel.

2158
02:13:05.26 --> 02:13:07.66
Jockel white tea.

2159
02:13:07.66 --> 02:13:08.66
Yes.

2160
02:13:08.66 --> 02:13:14.02
Taste delicious and is very good for you.

2161
02:13:14.02 --> 02:13:16.06
And it gives you 8,000 pound deadlift.

2162
02:13:16.06 --> 02:13:17.06
So give that one a try.

2163
02:13:17.06 --> 02:13:18.30
Also got some books.

2164
02:13:18.30 --> 02:13:21.06
We got Mike in the Dragons.

2165
02:13:21.06 --> 02:13:22.06
Okay.

2166
02:13:22.06 --> 02:13:23.06
Update.

2167
02:13:23.06 --> 02:13:24.30
I am printing them as fast I can.

2168
02:13:24.30 --> 02:13:28.86
There's a bunch of printers that are printing new copies of Mike in the Dragons.

2169
02:13:28.86 --> 02:13:32.14
Some of them have already been shipped that we going to Amazon.

2170
02:13:32.14 --> 02:13:34.86
We are going to be cutting it close right now.

2171
02:13:34.86 --> 02:13:35.86
Actually we should be good.

2172
02:13:35.86 --> 02:13:36.86
People that are ordering.

2173
02:13:36.86 --> 02:13:37.86
Well, it's going to be cutting close.

2174
02:13:37.86 --> 02:13:42.06
Depending on when you exactly order, whether it gets to you by Christmas or not.

2175
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:45.50
But the faster you order, the better chance you will have of getting it before Christmas

2176
02:13:45.50 --> 02:13:50.10
I apologize that I did not order enough books to be printed.

2177
02:13:50.10 --> 02:13:51.10
And that is my fault.

2178
02:13:51.10 --> 02:13:52.10
And I should have done better.

2179
02:13:52.10 --> 02:13:57.58
And as Sarah Armstrong pointed out to me, she's like, oh yeah, well you know why you didn't

2180
02:13:57.58 --> 02:14:01.14
order enough books because you thought, oh well Sarah will get a book and Andrew Paul will

2181
02:14:01.14 --> 02:14:04.62
get a book and I will still get a book and then everyone posts what they got and you

2182
02:14:04.62 --> 02:14:06.10
got 20 copies.

2183
02:14:06.10 --> 02:14:07.10
Sarah got 10 copies.

2184
02:14:07.10 --> 02:14:08.10
I was got 10 copies.

2185
02:14:08.10 --> 02:14:12.10
So everyone is buying multiple copies because it's the ultimate Christmas gift for anyone

2186
02:14:12.10 --> 02:14:18.22
between the ages of 0 and 10 or 12.

2187
02:14:18.22 --> 02:14:23.74
Anyways, Mike in the Dragons order it as quick as you can and we will try and get it to

2188
02:14:23.74 --> 02:14:24.74
you by Christmas.

2189
02:14:24.74 --> 02:14:26.98
If not, hey, what's the next holiday after Christmas?

2190
02:14:26.98 --> 02:14:30.74
New year's new year's new year's gift.

2191
02:14:30.74 --> 02:14:33.94
New year's gift and or what's after that Easter?

2192
02:14:33.94 --> 02:14:36.54
Well technically a Easter Valentine's Day.

2193
02:14:36.54 --> 02:14:37.54
Oh well.

2194
02:14:37.54 --> 02:14:39.50
Technically, he said all of it.

2195
02:14:39.50 --> 02:14:40.50
Okay.

2196
02:14:40.50 --> 02:14:42.74
You get Valentine's Day gift for your children, I guess.

2197
02:14:42.74 --> 02:14:43.74
Did you do that?

2198
02:14:43.74 --> 02:14:44.74
Yeah.

2199
02:14:44.74 --> 02:14:46.98
And if not, you know, just get it for him.

2200
02:14:46.98 --> 02:14:47.98
Yeah.

2201
02:14:47.98 --> 02:14:48.98
That's a good one.

2202
02:14:48.98 --> 02:14:50.50
That's a fun one.

2203
02:14:50.50 --> 02:14:56.30
That you mentioned that video and the goal there was to kind of a centriede capture what

2204
02:14:56.30 --> 02:14:57.30
it's like reading.

2205
02:14:57.30 --> 02:14:58.62
You know how you need a book.

2206
02:14:58.62 --> 02:15:00.02
It goes on in your head.

2207
02:15:00.02 --> 02:15:01.02
Yeah.

2208
02:15:01.02 --> 02:15:04.14
And so you capture what's going on in that book in your head and how you're reading it

2209
02:15:04.14 --> 02:15:06.50
to your kitty kind of capture that in a little summary.

2210
02:15:06.50 --> 02:15:07.50
That's what it was.

2211
02:15:07.50 --> 02:15:10.54
I think it did because that's really how I felt when I read that book to my daughter.

2212
02:15:10.54 --> 02:15:11.54
Yeah.

2213
02:15:11.54 --> 02:15:12.54
It's good.

2214
02:15:12.54 --> 02:15:13.54
Do you do voices when you read that book?

2215
02:15:13.54 --> 02:15:14.54
Let me hear the King voice.

2216
02:15:14.54 --> 02:15:18.10
Come on, man.

2217
02:15:18.10 --> 02:15:19.10
Sorry.

2218
02:15:19.10 --> 02:15:20.10
You're in my two minds.

2219
02:15:20.10 --> 02:15:21.10
Yeah.

2220
02:15:21.10 --> 02:15:22.10
Because it really is, but rather classify.

2221
02:15:22.10 --> 02:15:25.38
You would at least just give us a two my son.

2222
02:15:25.38 --> 02:15:27.38
Two my son.

2223
02:15:27.38 --> 02:15:29.10
That was awful.

2224
02:15:29.10 --> 02:15:33.58
I know, but I was like, it sounds way better when I read it to her.

2225
02:15:33.58 --> 02:15:34.58
I understand that.

2226
02:15:34.58 --> 02:15:35.58
Wow.

2227
02:15:35.58 --> 02:15:39.66
I also and I feel like a voice actor over here did that one.

2228
02:15:39.66 --> 02:15:40.66
You kind of are.

2229
02:15:40.66 --> 02:15:42.66
Anyway, hey, moving on.

2230
02:15:42.66 --> 02:15:43.66
Yeah.

2231
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:44.66
That's a nice, awesome book.

2232
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:47.70
Also, way of the warrior kid.

2233
02:15:47.70 --> 02:15:49.78
One and two.

2234
02:15:49.78 --> 02:15:52.90
From Wimpy to warrior kid.

2235
02:15:52.90 --> 02:15:53.90
And then Mark's mission.

2236
02:15:53.90 --> 02:15:56.66
That's number one number two.

2237
02:15:56.66 --> 02:15:59.46
Also important critical books.

2238
02:15:59.46 --> 02:16:06.14
I personally think or the one that my daughter request me to read again and again and again

2239
02:16:06.14 --> 02:16:07.66
is part two Mark's mission.

2240
02:16:07.66 --> 02:16:08.66
I'm just kidding.

2241
02:16:08.66 --> 02:16:10.82
She really likes Nathan.

2242
02:16:10.82 --> 02:16:11.82
Nathan James.

2243
02:16:11.82 --> 02:16:14.42
He likes that idea of that irritating person.

2244
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:16.26
No, because that's how kids are.

2245
02:16:16.26 --> 02:16:18.06
They always talk and you know, we call them.

2246
02:16:18.06 --> 02:16:20.46
She meets Danny Rinehart.

2247
02:16:20.46 --> 02:16:22.06
Danny Rinehart book three.

2248
02:16:22.06 --> 02:16:24.06
I'm in the process right now.

2249
02:16:24.06 --> 02:16:25.54
Ten chapters deep.

2250
02:16:25.54 --> 02:16:27.42
Danny Rinehart shows up.

2251
02:16:27.42 --> 02:16:30.22
So yeah, she'll like Danny Rinehart.

2252
02:16:30.22 --> 02:16:35.26
Even though my youngest daughter, when she found out about the character Danny Rinehart

2253
02:16:35.26 --> 02:16:36.26
and who he was.

2254
02:16:36.26 --> 02:16:39.90
And now she goes, Danny Rinehart.

2255
02:16:39.90 --> 02:16:42.42
Because the character he's like good at everything.

2256
02:16:42.42 --> 02:16:45.14
That's the premise of warrior kid three.

2257
02:16:45.14 --> 02:16:46.14
There's no bully.

2258
02:16:46.14 --> 02:16:47.14
Right.

2259
02:16:47.14 --> 02:16:50.30
First say, there's actually a kid that's a good kid.

2260
02:16:50.30 --> 02:16:51.58
He's good at jujitsu.

2261
02:16:51.58 --> 02:16:52.58
He's good at pull ups.

2262
02:16:52.58 --> 02:16:53.58
He's good at running.

2263
02:16:53.58 --> 02:16:54.82
He's good at everything.

2264
02:16:54.82 --> 02:16:55.82
And he's nice.

2265
02:16:55.82 --> 02:17:00.14
And that rubs Mark the wrong way because all of a sudden he's got some of these jealous of.

2266
02:17:00.14 --> 02:17:01.54
It's hitting his ego.

2267
02:17:01.54 --> 02:17:02.54
And what's that guy's name?

2268
02:17:02.54 --> 02:17:04.90
His name is Danny Rinehart.

2269
02:17:04.90 --> 02:17:06.54
How awesome is that?

2270
02:17:06.54 --> 02:17:09.74
So when I told my daughter that, she was like Danny Rinehart.

2271
02:17:09.74 --> 02:17:13.98
And she says, oh, she's just, what a Danny Rinehart do today.

2272
02:17:13.98 --> 02:17:18.58
But well, you kind of can anticipate that you're son or daughter that you're reading it

2273
02:17:18.58 --> 02:17:23.30
to or the person reading the, you know, if they're reading age, they're going to like

2274
02:17:23.30 --> 02:17:24.86
Danny Rinehart.

2275
02:17:24.86 --> 02:17:25.86
They are.

2276
02:17:25.86 --> 02:17:26.86
But they're, I don't know.

2277
02:17:26.86 --> 02:17:29.70
They might, they might side with Mark a little bit.

2278
02:17:29.70 --> 02:17:33.34
Because he's in here Mark's getting annoyed because Danny just, he does this.

2279
02:17:33.34 --> 02:17:38.78
He taps, he'll tap someone out and say like, oh, you know, I must have got lucky.

2280
02:17:38.78 --> 02:17:39.78
He's one of those kind of guys.

2281
02:17:39.78 --> 02:17:41.74
We're like, he beats him in a running race.

2282
02:17:41.74 --> 02:17:44.66
And he's like, oh, yeah, you know, I was feeling pretty good today, I guess.

2283
02:17:44.66 --> 02:17:49.02
And one of those guys, you won't take credit for anything, which is an, and since it

2284
02:17:49.02 --> 02:17:50.54
already bothers Mark that he lost.

2285
02:17:50.54 --> 02:17:52.02
He said, what did he say that?

2286
02:17:52.02 --> 02:17:53.02
Right.

2287
02:17:53.02 --> 02:17:54.02
Yeah.

2288
02:17:54.02 --> 02:17:56.38
And plus we all been on the mission since, you know, it'd be since before Mark could even

2289
02:17:56.38 --> 02:17:57.38
do pull ups.

2290
02:17:57.38 --> 02:17:58.38
We've been with him the whole time.

2291
02:17:58.38 --> 02:17:59.38
Yeah.

2292
02:17:59.38 --> 02:18:00.38
So we're feeling his pain with him.

2293
02:18:00.38 --> 02:18:03.38
So now this guy, Danny, he hasn't felt any pain.

2294
02:18:03.38 --> 02:18:04.38
No.

2295
02:18:04.38 --> 02:18:05.38
Forget that.

2296
02:18:05.38 --> 02:18:06.38
Danny just naturally good at everything.

2297
02:18:06.38 --> 02:18:07.38
He's screwed that guy.

2298
02:18:07.38 --> 02:18:08.38
Yeah.

2299
02:18:08.38 --> 02:18:10.30
And that's going to be coming out in the spring.

2300
02:18:10.30 --> 02:18:13.14
Oh, hopefully if I finish it in time, but which I will.

2301
02:18:13.14 --> 02:18:17.58
Oh, just when it was freedom of field manual, you can get that book to that's another

2302
02:18:17.58 --> 02:18:20.58
book that you can get for the holiday season.

2303
02:18:20.58 --> 02:18:21.98
Let's just say that.

2304
02:18:21.98 --> 02:18:28.62
If it might kind of mess up like jam up someone's new year a little bit, if they try

2305
02:18:28.62 --> 02:18:31.10
and get on the path like for Christmas.

2306
02:18:31.10 --> 02:18:32.70
Like what pre-new year's resolution.

2307
02:18:32.70 --> 02:18:33.70
Yeah.

2308
02:18:33.70 --> 02:18:34.70
Yeah.

2309
02:18:34.70 --> 02:18:37.58
Oh, maybe they maybe they use that to kick off the New Year's resolution.

2310
02:18:37.58 --> 02:18:38.58
Like a little deaf core.

2311
02:18:38.58 --> 02:18:39.58
Yeah.

2312
02:18:39.58 --> 02:18:40.78
But here's the thing, though.

2313
02:18:40.78 --> 02:18:43.58
I think you might even say it in that book.

2314
02:18:43.58 --> 02:18:44.58
Maybe.

2315
02:18:44.58 --> 02:18:45.58
Yeah, I've said it.

2316
02:18:45.58 --> 02:18:47.58
No New Year's resolution today.

2317
02:18:47.58 --> 02:18:48.58
Now, right now, yeah.

2318
02:18:48.58 --> 02:18:49.58
Yeah.

2319
02:18:49.58 --> 02:18:50.58
I've said that many times.

2320
02:18:50.58 --> 02:18:52.58
And I believe it's to this moment.

2321
02:18:52.58 --> 02:18:53.58
Yeah.

2322
02:18:53.58 --> 02:18:55.18
So yeah, that's the, this because freedom field manual.

2323
02:18:55.18 --> 02:18:57.58
The audio version of that is not an audible.

2324
02:18:57.58 --> 02:18:58.58
It is on.

2325
02:18:58.58 --> 02:19:02.26
It's an MP3 thing iTunes Amazon Music Google Play.

2326
02:19:02.26 --> 02:19:03.82
Extreme ownership.

2327
02:19:03.82 --> 02:19:04.98
That's the first leadership.

2328
02:19:04.98 --> 02:19:08.10
I wrote book, I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2329
02:19:08.10 --> 02:19:16.98
We followed that up with the dichotomy of leadership, which is possibly better.

2330
02:19:16.98 --> 02:19:19.38
Anyways, you should check it out.

2331
02:19:19.38 --> 02:19:26.94
It will teach you how to pragmatically apply the policies put forth in extreme ownership

2332
02:19:26.94 --> 02:19:31.30
into your world.

2333
02:19:31.30 --> 02:19:34.82
We also have a leadership consultant company.

2334
02:19:34.82 --> 02:19:35.82
So I'll promise the leadership.

2335
02:19:35.82 --> 02:19:36.82
That's what we do.

2336
02:19:36.82 --> 02:19:40.54
It's me, Dave Babin, JP, D'Nell, Dave Burke, Flynn, Cochran, Mike, Surelly, Mike,

Also we got the master in 2019.

2341
02:19:53.66 --> 02:19:56.46
There's going to be one in Chicago.

2342
02:19:56.46 --> 02:19:58.58
There's going to be one in Denver.

2343
02:19:58.58 --> 02:20:02.22
And if you want to come to the master, they've also told out.

And we have EF Overwatch, which connects spec ops, vets, and aviation combat aviation vets

2346
02:20:15.30 --> 02:20:20.10

And any you Marsock raiders out there that have gotten out, hit it up at EF Overwatch.com.

2348
02:20:26.74 --> 02:20:32.58
So we can get you connected to a job where you will be in a leadership position in the civilian

2349
02:20:32.58 --> 02:20:33.58
sector.

2350
02:20:33.58 --> 02:20:36.82
Again, that's EF Overwatch.com.

2351
02:20:36.82 --> 02:20:43.70
If you want to hang with us still after this on the interwebs, first of all, Derek, like I

2352
02:20:43.70 --> 02:20:53.18
said, he left, but Twitter, D'Rickraera, Instagram, D'Rick underscore, fae spoke, D'Rickraera,

2353
02:20:53.18 --> 02:20:55.26
D'Rickraera.com.

2354
02:20:55.26 --> 02:21:00.38
And also the Marine Raider Foundation, again, he talked about all the things that the Marine

2355
02:21:00.38 --> 02:21:01.70
Raider Foundation does.

2356
02:21:01.70 --> 02:21:07.82
And if you want to go to that, the link is marine RaiderFoundation.org.

2357
02:21:07.82 --> 02:21:13.94
And then of course, if you want to talk with Eko and myself on Twitter, on Instagram,

2358
02:21:13.94 --> 02:21:17.98
or on Facebook, D'Rickraera.

2359
02:21:17.98 --> 02:21:25.78
Eko is at Eko Charles, and I am at Jocca Willink, and thanks to all our military personnel

2360
02:21:25.78 --> 02:21:28.94
out there holding the line.

2361
02:21:28.94 --> 02:21:35.96
We can do what we do because you are doing what you do, and we will never forget that

2362
02:21:35.96 --> 02:21:45.74
in special thanks to the Marine Raiders for your legacy of bravery that will never be forgotten.

2363
02:21:45.74 --> 02:21:53.82
And obviously, Derek Awerra for his sacrifice, and like I said to him the incredible

2364
02:21:53.82 --> 02:21:57.70
example that he sets.

2365
02:21:57.70 --> 02:22:01.78
Thanks to police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, correctional officers,

2366
02:22:01.78 --> 02:22:04.86
board of patrol, all first responders.

2367
02:22:04.86 --> 02:22:14.22
Thank you for keeping us safe here at home, and the rest of you that are out there listening.

2368
02:22:14.22 --> 02:22:20.34
I know things don't always go the way we want them to go.

2369
02:22:20.34 --> 02:22:31.18
But I think just listening to Derek today, I think there's no doubt that that is the attitude

2370
02:22:31.18 --> 02:22:32.18
you take.

2371
02:22:32.18 --> 02:22:33.42
You don't focus on what is wrong.

2372
02:22:33.42 --> 02:22:34.58
You focus on what is right.

2373
02:22:34.58 --> 02:22:36.62
You don't focus on what you can't do.

2374
02:22:36.62 --> 02:22:38.66
You focus on what you can do.

2375
02:22:38.66 --> 02:22:43.34
You're thankful that you have these opportunities.

2376
02:22:43.34 --> 02:22:46.94
So many didn't get.

2377
02:22:46.94 --> 02:22:53.70
Then you take that attitude and then you go out there and get after it.

2378
02:22:53.70 --> 02:23:15.14
Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
