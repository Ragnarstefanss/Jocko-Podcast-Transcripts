00:01:02.98 --> 00:01:09.58 Special holidays like birthdays or Christmas or Valentine's Day or Veterans Day or even Memorial day
00:01:09.58 --> 00:01:19.02 Today isn't special because it's the 50 second podcast today is special
00:01:20.78 --> 00:01:22.78 Because it's today
00:01:24.62 --> 00:01:26.62 Today is special
00:01:26.62 --> 00:01:28.62 Because we are alive
00:01:29.42 --> 00:01:31.42 Because we're breathing
00:01:31.42 --> 00:01:38.38 And when you're here and you're alive and you recognize that
00:01:40.06 --> 00:01:43.10 Recognize that that you're alive today
00:01:46.10 --> 00:01:49.34 That makes every day special makes every day of miracle
00:01:51.66 --> 00:01:55.86 Makes every day a gift and that might seem like a
00:01:55.86 --> 00:02:02.02 A tight platitude but it isn't
00:02:04.26 --> 00:02:11.18 And if you've seen brave young men who give their lives on the battlefield for their brothers
00:02:13.86 --> 00:02:15.86 Or you've seen
00:02:16.86 --> 00:02:19.86 Stoic young children
00:02:19.86 --> 00:02:25.78 Facing some kind of terminal disease or you would have had death
00:02:27.70 --> 00:02:29.70 Attack your life with its
00:02:30.66 --> 00:02:32.66 multitude of heartless weapons
00:02:33.30 --> 00:02:38.90 Cancer and disease and suicide and accidents and addiction and murder and war
00:02:43.30 --> 00:02:48.82 And if you've seen those things then you know it isn't a platitude and it isn't cliche
00:02:48.82 --> 00:02:50.82 You know it's true
00:02:52.90 --> 00:02:54.90 Every day
00:02:56.10 --> 00:03:00.02 Yes, a special day every day is a gift every day is awesome
00:03:02.74 --> 00:03:08.34 And so what are we gonna do special for this podcast right here the same thing that we always do
00:03:09.14 --> 00:03:13.18 Gonna give it everything we've got we're gonna leave it all in the mat. We prepared
00:03:13.18 --> 00:03:18.34 We invested we studied we thought and we're gonna get after it
00:03:20.14 --> 00:03:22.14 Why
00:03:22.14 --> 00:03:27.98 Not because this is number 52 not because it's been one year not because we made it this far
00:03:30.78 --> 00:03:32.78 But because this is the one
00:03:34.78 --> 00:03:36.78 It's the one
00:03:37.02 --> 00:03:41.34 The one life we have this is the one shot we get at today
00:03:41.34 --> 00:03:43.34 This day now
00:03:47.66 --> 00:03:49.66 And so
00:03:49.26 --> 00:03:54.38 We are going to get after it like we always do and we're gonna make it count
00:03:57.90 --> 00:03:59.90 So
00:04:01.02 --> 00:04:03.74 There I go let's do this now
00:04:04.38 --> 00:04:10.14 I did go a little bit along with the last last podcast, you know we were introducing the Korean War
00:04:10.14 --> 00:04:17.10 The coldest war on that last episode so I went a little I went a little crazy on that one
00:04:17.90 --> 00:04:21.18 We all need to hear about that. We're gonna hear some more but today
00:04:22.46 --> 00:04:24.46 Who on straight to Q and A
00:04:25.02 --> 00:04:27.02 From
00:04:27.02 --> 00:04:29.02 From the interwebs
00:04:30.14 --> 00:04:36.46 So echo Charles what he got question number one go
00:04:36.46 --> 00:04:38.46 All right
00:04:40.06 --> 00:04:42.30 Okay, first question jocco
00:04:43.98 --> 00:04:48.30 How did you have time to train in martial arts while deployed?
00:04:49.10 --> 00:04:53.34 I figured that you were too busy with combat even think about training while deployed
00:04:54.94 --> 00:04:57.42 Thank you for the information. Okay, so
00:04:59.34 --> 00:05:01.34 a couple things
00:05:01.34 --> 00:05:01.98 I
00:05:01.98 --> 00:05:07.26 Always brought mats with me when we deployed and it was really good, you know because once I was in a leadership position
00:05:07.26 --> 00:05:11.50 I could kind of make that happen pretty easily. How does that how does that happen do you just say hey
00:05:12.46 --> 00:05:18.38 I do you tell some had mats no I had mats and I actually got mats from the team and then we would just put them on a big
00:05:18.38 --> 00:05:23.74 Palette when you deploy you you go on you put all your gear on these big palettes so some of those palettes
00:05:23.74 --> 00:05:28.78 We have mats on mats and then when we would go on deployment now pre-war
00:05:28.78 --> 00:05:35.02 It was you know we we go on deployment we just bring mats and train wherever we could train and then
00:05:35.58 --> 00:05:38.78 Once the war started and I still brought mats
00:05:39.10 --> 00:05:43.10 I was like hey war there's not like we're gonna have us working 24 hours a day
00:05:43.50 --> 00:05:49.82 So and if they did we just wouldn't be able to train but I was prepared for training and what what I did both my deployments to Iraq is I had a
00:05:50.38 --> 00:05:54.78 What's called a GP medium tent which is basically a really really big tent and
00:05:54.78 --> 00:06:01.82 And they have air conditioning and they have dual walls so it stays kind of cool and I just made that into a little mini fight room
00:06:01.82 --> 00:06:07.90 But mats out and then I would just train when there was downtime and there is downtime when you're on deployment
00:06:07.90 --> 00:06:12.38 I mean there is definitely downtime when you're on deployment and like what are you gonna do with your downtime
00:06:12.62 --> 00:06:15.74 Is the question now some guys with their downtime
00:06:15.90 --> 00:06:19.42 They decide to do something that's maybe not super productive
00:06:19.42 --> 00:06:24.86 Give you an example that there was some guys on my first deployment to Iraq and
00:06:26.14 --> 00:06:32.94 They played Halo. It's a video game. Have you heard of it? Yes, okay. It's a first person shooter video game
00:06:32.94 --> 00:06:37.90 And so my guys were so they just played anytime we weren't working
00:06:38.14 --> 00:06:40.86 Which you know our missions at that point we're doing little direct action missions
00:06:40.86 --> 00:06:44.70 They don't take a few hours even you know the planning and you know every two or three days
00:06:44.70 --> 00:06:52.38 So you you had time right and so all the time and they had the they had wires set up so they could play different
00:06:53.34 --> 00:06:57.82 Each other in different tents. Yeah, it was really ridiculous and
00:06:58.70 --> 00:07:01.58 Meanwhile the guys that were a little more hardcore we were training the Jits
00:07:01.58 --> 00:07:04.38 But but these guys and actually these guys were good mugs too
00:07:04.70 --> 00:07:09.42 But what's funny is so I kind of thought like what is wrong with these guys? Why are they doing this but you know whatever
00:07:09.42 --> 00:07:17.82 And then all of a sudden they had a the the group above us the group that was in charge of the seals that were there
00:07:18.86 --> 00:07:24.06 It's called the siege of soda if the combined joint special operations task force that group
00:07:25.02 --> 00:07:28.38 They hosted a halo tournament
00:07:29.58 --> 00:07:35.82 Like in all the different special operations groups went and did this halo tournament and
00:07:35.82 --> 00:07:39.90 And I don't know if I'm proud of this or not proud of this
00:07:40.70 --> 00:07:43.58 But two my guys that entered the tournament
00:07:44.22 --> 00:07:45.18 They they
00:07:45.18 --> 00:07:53.82 Completed one but not only did they want win. I guess the way you play halo you get you can die multiple times and so after a certain number of times
00:07:53.82 --> 00:07:56.86 Like you play to a certain number of deaths. I guess but anyways
00:07:57.42 --> 00:07:59.02 The in the finals
00:07:59.02 --> 00:08:04.14 These two guys beat the other guys that were from some army group or something
00:08:04.14 --> 00:08:07.18 They beat them 50 deaths to two
00:08:08.86 --> 00:08:11.74 So I was just say to myself really
00:08:12.70 --> 00:08:17.90 So anyways the next deployment guys were playing some other I never I don't play video games
00:08:17.90 --> 00:08:23.50 But the other guys played in when we were to remind you guys were playing I don't want to say John Madden football
00:08:23.50 --> 00:08:27.74 That's a good. Oh, yeah, see I don't know cuz I don't play video games tech echo Charles
00:08:28.38 --> 00:08:32.46 But but what I was doing during those times during those down time since yes bring
00:08:32.46 --> 00:08:34.46 Um bring
00:08:34.62 --> 00:08:42.22 Maths and trained you did so and there's always guys even though there'll be plenty guys playing video games and we we trained you did to for sure and you should make time for it because you know what
00:08:43.34 --> 00:08:45.34 You think about
00:08:45.34 --> 00:08:51.18 Being under stressful situation well, what's gonna help you with the stressful situation a physical outlet a little mental break
00:08:51.98 --> 00:08:55.74 And guess what guess what gives you a physical outlet and gives you mental break to doing some jutsu so
00:08:56.06 --> 00:09:01.42 You know of course there's times where we'd go and we'd go in the field or we'd have multiple back to back to back to back
00:09:01.42 --> 00:09:05.66 Operations and we wouldn't be able to train no big deal of course their job takes their total priority over it
00:09:06.06 --> 00:09:11.18 But um yeah, so I would always train and I'll tell you one more thing
00:09:12.46 --> 00:09:16.94 When I would go into a deployment like let's say your guy that trains and you go into deployment
00:09:17.10 --> 00:09:21.66 Well, there's gonna be somebody that will train with you even if there are never train before somebody's gonna go
00:09:21.66 --> 00:09:23.66 Yeah, I'll train with you and
00:09:23.98 --> 00:09:25.34 Those guys
00:09:25.34 --> 00:09:31.18 That's that happened to me you know where I went on to playing with a bunch of guys that didn't know anything and I just was teaching them
00:09:31.18 --> 00:09:34.30 And when I came back from a six month deployment this is before the war
00:09:34.86 --> 00:09:41.58 I was definitely way better than I was before our life so even though I was only training with guys that were not even close to as good as me
00:09:41.82 --> 00:09:45.66 Just training all the time and just going with guys, you know strong tough
00:09:46.22 --> 00:09:49.42 Team guys made me better and when I got back I had
00:09:50.14 --> 00:09:55.10 Improved a lot in comparison with the guys that I was training with before I left that were training all the time while it's gone
00:09:55.10 --> 00:09:57.10 So you can make improvement
00:09:57.10 --> 00:10:02.30 Even if you're just have bodies to move around and you can focus on your offense
00:10:02.30 --> 00:10:05.34 You can put yourself in bad positions as a bunch of ways to get better while you're doing it
00:10:05.34 --> 00:10:08.70 So yeah, man you can train you can train on deployment for sure
00:10:08.70 --> 00:10:13.26 We just had a couple guys come back from deployment from the Marine Corps and you know
00:10:13.26 --> 00:10:15.90 They they were on a ship board deployment. They trained all the time
00:10:15.90 --> 00:10:20.22 You know, they just came back to victory and man. They've been trained in the whole time. They got good too
00:10:20.22 --> 00:10:23.90 They improved their game a lot. Yeah, I seen guys train. I think it was Army guys
00:10:23.90 --> 00:10:27.26 They're training and they trained with the jacket on and they use the jacket as the gear
00:10:27.26 --> 00:10:31.18 I mean different but kind of this oh yeah, it's the same. We you know and I've done that to
00:10:32.14 --> 00:10:34.06 In fact the early days of jujitsu from me
00:10:34.06 --> 00:10:36.62 I spent that's why I would nogie started getting popular
00:10:37.26 --> 00:10:40.22 I kind of knew nogie because we used to train in
00:10:40.78 --> 00:10:43.74 BDU pants so like camouflage pants and a t-shirt
00:10:43.74 --> 00:10:46.38 That's sort of seemed like a good compromise
00:10:46.78 --> 00:10:47.82 And then
00:10:47.82 --> 00:10:53.02 And plus Dean and I trained nogie a lot even though Dean was Dean was training nogie because he wrestled in and it was an
00:10:53.02 --> 00:10:57.02 He doing MMA and stuff too. What he did you did nogie way before he did
00:10:58.54 --> 00:11:04.62 Before he did MMA. I mean we were trained in nogie. I don't even know what I've asked Dean where the idea came
00:11:04.94 --> 00:11:09.02 Cuz even in sombo you were a jacket right? Yeah, and he was a sombo guy too
00:11:10.06 --> 00:11:15.02 Do you guys go like all when you train like hey, I'm a you know, I'm just one of the team guys
00:11:15.02 --> 00:11:20.14 I don't train you to you're like hey, let's go train. What did you do full on training like for six?
00:11:20.14 --> 00:11:26.86 You know eight minute rounds or yeah, it's the same thing I've been talking about before like I would get guys that were training
00:11:27.10 --> 00:11:32.30 Even if they're a lower level and I'm just trained with all of them and just line them up and go and then they betraying with each other too
00:11:32.30 --> 00:11:36.06 You know and I would teach a little classes and say hey, this is how you do this and you know
00:11:36.46 --> 00:11:38.46 You know me I kind of liked to roll
00:11:38.46 --> 00:11:40.86 Yeah, but so I would always end up rolling a lot
00:11:41.42 --> 00:11:45.70 But you know you get good tough team guys that wrestled or their high school
00:11:45.70 --> 00:11:50.74 Yes, they did judo so there's guys and they they always bring it so it's good training when yeah, and they're moving
00:11:50.74 --> 00:11:54.02 Yeah, you know, they're not like and they got great cardio and strong
00:11:54.58 --> 00:11:59.26 And then you know anytime there was Marines round or or soldiers around there was some Rangers down the street from me
00:11:59.26 --> 00:12:01.22 I train with a few of those guys a couple times
00:12:01.46 --> 00:12:06.54 So yeah, I'm getting after it you can definitely you gotta find a way to do it and then you make time to do it
00:12:08.58 --> 00:12:10.58 Next question
00:12:10.58 --> 00:12:19.06 My boss instituted mandatory uncompensated monthly meetings with the added warning that if we miss own
00:12:19.78 --> 00:12:21.78 There'd be repercussions
00:12:22.02 --> 00:12:27.14 Well, this is an unjust move on his part. I'm choosing to remain silent and not complain
00:12:27.14 --> 00:12:31.94 I decided that this is not enough of a of a pressing issue for me to speak out against
00:12:32.42 --> 00:12:36.02 That way the next time I decide to actually raise an issue over something
00:12:36.58 --> 00:12:38.58 It'll have more of an impact
00:12:38.58 --> 00:12:45.30 This was influenced by your decision to only ask for or ask your leadership for help only when absolutely necessary
00:12:45.78 --> 00:12:49.86 Because of this when you did ask for something your request was taken much more seriously
00:12:50.58 --> 00:12:55.38 Do you think this was the right way to lead up the chain of command in this scenario?
00:12:56.26 --> 00:13:01.78 Yeah, I think that's a very good way to lead up the chain of command in that scenario and you gotta choose your battles
00:13:02.58 --> 00:13:05.58 Because it is possible in any job to
00:13:05.58 --> 00:13:12.38 To cry wolf right it's possible say oh, this is this is the way we can't do this and it's it's possible if you complain about everything
00:13:12.38 --> 00:13:15.74 Eventually you're not getting listened to anymore. So what I would do here
00:13:16.14 --> 00:13:20.86 Definitely attend the meetings right the show up for the meetings you tend the meetings you see what they're about to see what the deal is
00:13:21.42 --> 00:13:22.94 What is he trying to accomplish?
00:13:22.94 --> 00:13:27.18 Maybe he has some really good thing that he's trying to accomplish gotta put out wherever we don't know yet
00:13:27.34 --> 00:13:32.62 Maybe his vision is that this only it's gonna only gonna hold these mandatory meetings until he gets a flow and he gets everybody on board
00:13:32.62 --> 00:13:35.02 And then he can go cool. We don't have to do this anymore. You guys got it
00:13:35.02 --> 00:13:40.22 I don't know what his vision is. You know what's he trying to make happen? Let's give him that credit as the leader to say
00:13:40.38 --> 00:13:47.86 Hey, you know you're calling this meeting. We're gonna show up there. We're gonna do our best to participate and and get the most out of the meeting
00:13:48.94 --> 00:13:54.22 Find out what it's all about so go to the meetings then now you got your guys so you might be a little bit worried
00:13:54.78 --> 00:13:59.38 About your guys right saying hey why you making us attend this meeting at the mosque? We got to go to and
00:14:00.30 --> 00:14:02.30 on that one
00:14:02.30 --> 00:14:07.58 I would likely do is make everyone attend a few and I would do it to hey guys the boss having a meeting no
00:14:07.58 --> 00:14:10.46 We're not gonna get paid but look we're gonna get word when I find out what's going on
00:14:10.46 --> 00:14:14.14 So I want everyone's everyone's gotta be there, right? So you don't pass the buck
00:14:14.78 --> 00:14:22.94 You you maintain the the responsibility of what's happening you own it and then maybe maybe after a little while though
00:14:23.34 --> 00:14:28.06 You look at the boss and you say hey boss, you know what these meetings are good to go. I'm getting a lot out of them
00:14:28.06 --> 00:14:33.10 But I'm not gonna make my I don't want to make my guys go. I want to pass the word to them so is that all right?
00:14:33.10 --> 00:14:36.30 If I have them skip the meetings, but I'll be there and then I'll put out the information and
00:14:37.02 --> 00:14:39.90 You know most likely you'll get a hey that sounds good
00:14:40.54 --> 00:14:46.54 Especially if you've been attending the meetings and you've been participating you've been raised in your hand and saying take a notes and saying yeah
00:14:46.54 --> 00:14:48.86 We got that boss we can make that happen if you've been
00:14:49.66 --> 00:14:53.90 We is that kissing ass? No, no, no, it's building a relationship, right now
00:14:54.30 --> 00:14:56.06 there is a
00:14:56.06 --> 00:15:00.70 Distinction right between kissing ass and building a relationship and don't kiss ass
00:15:01.18 --> 00:15:05.26 Because you're not building a relationship when you kiss ass as a matter of fact people are turned off by it
00:15:05.34 --> 00:15:10.22 So you don't want to be that guy hey boss what a wonderful meeting. I got so much out of it
00:15:10.22 --> 00:15:15.26 No, no, no, no, but participate and getting the game that's all I'm saying I'm not saying kiss ass because kiss ass is gonna get you
00:15:15.66 --> 00:15:17.90 It's gonna it's gonna look bad. I mean
00:15:17.90 --> 00:15:21.34 Order some bosses that that feed off of that. Yes, there are and
00:15:21.34 --> 00:15:27.26 We got to be might have to play that game a little bit you might have to play that game a little not gonna feel good. That's why we have to put our ego in check
00:15:27.26 --> 00:15:28.78 Yeah
00:15:28.78 --> 00:15:30.78 And then
00:15:30.78 --> 00:15:33.34 Yeah, that's what I would do so I think you made the right call
00:15:33.90 --> 00:15:37.98 Let's get in go to go to a bunch of these meetings see what they're all about and maybe you know
00:15:37.98 --> 00:15:41.10 Eventually you're saying hey boss, you know these are uncomplicated we could probably
00:15:41.66 --> 00:15:48.70 Utilize these hours better if we did something this or we did that so this is a good good straight forward method
00:15:48.70 --> 00:15:53.58 I think you made the right call and let us know how it goes. Yeah, yeah, that kissing ass thing
00:15:54.54 --> 00:15:59.02 Everyone knows your kissing ass and everyone even if the boy I mean really what you're doing is you're trading
00:15:59.74 --> 00:16:02.70 Your long-term respect you're training that in for that short-term
00:16:03.10 --> 00:16:06.46 popularity, you know with just the boss by the way
00:16:07.18 --> 00:16:09.66 Like all you thought because your popularity is going down
00:16:10.22 --> 00:16:12.06 Everyone's looking like look at that guy
00:16:12.06 --> 00:16:15.10 Kissing ass look at him even the boss even if he likes it
00:16:15.50 --> 00:16:17.50 There's a big part of his reign's like
00:16:17.50 --> 00:16:22.70 Right, so that's what I'm saying that you don't have to kiss ass right you don't have to kiss ass, but you know what you?
00:16:23.66 --> 00:16:27.50 What is the boss want someone that's kissing their ass and saying wow what a wonderful idea or someone that's actively
00:16:27.58 --> 00:16:30.94 Participating like a professional. That's what they want. Yeah, so they want
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:33.50 So do that gotta be down for the cause
00:16:33.50 --> 00:16:35.50 You're like dang I'm down for the cause
00:16:36.06 --> 00:16:40.46 I'll tell you whenever I'm with someone I'll tell you why you know that kind of thing but ultimately if you're down for the cause
00:16:40.46 --> 00:16:42.70 Your boss is caused with the whole cause or whatever
00:16:43.58 --> 00:16:45.58 That's
00:16:45.58 --> 00:16:50.46 Much of it changes with your attitude yeah if you're attitude is like oh man this is
00:16:50.46 --> 00:16:52.06 Well, you go go in this media
00:16:52.06 --> 00:16:55.58 We're not gonna pay what if you're not just like hey, this is really cool with the lead that the boss is stepping up
00:16:55.58 --> 00:16:58.30 He's trying to get us engaged in this. I'm gonna go when they're gonna get after it
00:16:58.30 --> 00:17:00.54 That that that just totally changed your attitude right there
00:17:00.54 --> 00:17:04.54 I thought that a million times played that little game in my head said alright my boss is idiot
00:17:04.54 --> 00:17:08.30 You know what I'm an idiot. Let's go let's make this happen. I'm gonna get after it
00:17:08.30 --> 00:17:12.06 What is what stupid thing is you gonna tell me you don't ever do with that stupid thing you he tells me do
00:17:12.06 --> 00:17:13.18 I'm gonna crush you
00:17:13.18 --> 00:17:15.90 I did that when I was going off your candidate school and
00:17:17.42 --> 00:17:21.66 There's this thing at officer candidate school where you have to yell everything that you say
00:17:21.66 --> 00:17:26.10 They call it being ballistic they say you got to be ballistic at all times and it's pretty cool
00:17:26.10 --> 00:17:30.30 Why they do it actually they do it because you get some people that are coming in the military
00:17:30.30 --> 00:17:34.38 Cuz when you go to OCS most of the people that are going through OCS with have never been in the military before
00:17:34.38 --> 00:17:39.10 They're coming from college and they graduate college and now they're going OCS so they got 13 weeks to get turned into an officer
00:17:39.42 --> 00:17:41.02 so
00:17:41.02 --> 00:17:44.46 What they do is they make you yell everything. Why do they do that?
00:17:44.46 --> 00:17:49.02 The reason they make you yell everything is because there's some people that aren't confident when they speak
00:17:49.58 --> 00:17:53.18 And so everything that they're gonna say they're gonna be shy about saying it well at OCS
00:17:53.66 --> 00:17:58.94 You've actually got a yell everything that you say because you can't go on the bridge of a ship and say
00:17:59.74 --> 00:18:04.62 Can can we turn the shift you know 90 degrees to the port? No, no, no, you have to speak up. You have to say hey
00:18:04.86 --> 00:18:10.30 We're starting 90 degrees port. I don't actually know what the command is because I wasn't a service warfare officer, but you know you say hey
00:18:10.30 --> 00:18:18.94 We're gonna turn 90 degrees port. You can't say it in a timid way and so the way they beat that out of you is by making you yell every single thing that you do when you're an officer
00:18:18.94 --> 00:18:20.94 You can't have it's go so
00:18:20.94 --> 00:18:27.82 What what we did was the upper classman that control you when you're going through there's like a class that's getting ready to graduate
00:18:27.82 --> 00:18:33.82 And they kind of control you when the drill instructors aren't there and so they also make a little money for their fund
00:18:34.38 --> 00:18:37.90 And the way they make money for the fund is selling soda and candy and this little
00:18:37.90 --> 00:18:41.42 This little closet, right? I mean it's it's it's authorized
00:18:42.22 --> 00:18:44.22 So my class
00:18:44.22 --> 00:18:46.22 I said hey guys
00:18:46.22 --> 00:18:49.26 When you go into I was the class president or as a you go
00:18:50.06 --> 00:18:52.06 As a when you go into
00:18:52.78 --> 00:18:53.74 the
00:18:53.74 --> 00:18:58.46 Office to buy candy or soda which I don't recommend but if you do
00:18:58.94 --> 00:19:02.38 If you do do it go in there and be ballistic and
00:19:03.10 --> 00:19:07.66 They're like why I'm gonna do it because those are the rules and so everyone lined up
00:19:07.66 --> 00:19:14.06 And they went in this little closet there yell at the I would like one Coca-Cola and one stickers bar sir and
00:19:14.70 --> 00:19:15.74 After
00:19:15.74 --> 00:19:20.22 10 people the first nuts and they're the upper class and it comes out and goes you guys
00:19:20.46 --> 00:19:24.22 Got no longer allowed to be ballistic and that was the way that we what
00:19:24.78 --> 00:19:28.22 But you know just get it. I actually did that muds do what I do
00:19:29.02 --> 00:19:33.74 Stuff to the to the extreme you know like you got to get wet and sandy and buds
00:19:33.74 --> 00:19:37.74 And which means you got to get jump in the ocean and roll around in the sand
00:19:38.22 --> 00:19:39.26 Well
00:19:39.26 --> 00:19:44.94 I would jump in the ocean. I would roll around the sand and then when you get back to the instructor that told you to go get wet and
00:19:44.94 --> 00:19:50.70 Sand you'd have to go back to them and say who y'all instructor Charles to make sure that they knew that you got wet and sandy
00:19:50.94 --> 00:19:53.26 So what I would do is I'd go I didn't do to me
00:19:53.26 --> 00:19:57.50 But I don't want to figure it out that I could do this I did it I would go I would get wet
00:19:57.50 --> 00:20:05.50 I would get sandy I would completely I would completely cover my every square inch my body with sand and then I would put
00:20:05.98 --> 00:20:11.50 Sand into my mouth I would fill my salad my mouth and sand it would I'd run up to
00:20:12.06 --> 00:20:15.42 Say who y'all to the instructor when I'd say who y'all dry sand
00:20:15.66 --> 00:20:17.66 Come out of my mouth
00:20:17.66 --> 00:20:22.30 It was uh it was pretty fun so I like to have that attitude like oh you want to make me do something great
00:20:22.38 --> 00:20:24.70 I'll do it and I'm gonna do it with with
00:20:24.70 --> 00:20:33.34 With vigor and enthusiasm and and then we literally in my in my bud's class when at a certain point
00:20:33.98 --> 00:20:37.18 They told us we weren't allowed to get wet and sand anymore
00:20:37.18 --> 00:20:42.46 They literally told us that and they said no you're gonna you weren't allowed to get wet anymore
00:20:42.86 --> 00:20:44.70 And we were saying what's wrong?
00:20:44.70 --> 00:20:48.62 There's no it's you're not allowed and that so it actually yeah, okay?
00:20:48.62 --> 00:20:54.38 Well, yeah, it's kind of like they're they're like kind of pushing pushing you down this hill with this
00:20:54.38 --> 00:20:59.66 Expectation that you're gonna be put putting on the brakes just run into the fire. Yeah, so like the more
00:20:59.82 --> 00:21:05.02 They push it down the hill the more your natural tendency hopefully is gonna be to put on the brakes
00:21:05.02 --> 00:21:08.22 That's why all that works, you know like oh go get wet and say and I think all that sucks
00:21:08.38 --> 00:21:11.26 But if you're like when saying it does do this kind of thing then it's like
00:21:11.26 --> 00:21:14.94 And then you know where you can put on the brakes when they say stop
00:21:14.94 --> 00:21:18.86 Okay, we're gonna get wet and one of my buddies
00:21:18.86 --> 00:21:24.78 We so there's something called flights where you run up this hill and you carry palettes
00:21:24.78 --> 00:21:28.22 You know what a palette is right? They're I don't know they're made of wood or steel
00:21:28.46 --> 00:21:31.66 We had both there they call them flights and they actually have a little flight tower
00:21:32.86 --> 00:21:36.94 Just a little bit it's called flights. Yeah, you put this thing on your backs
00:21:36.94 --> 00:21:42.78 Or you look like an airplane and you run up this hill and come back and you do it as a squad and when you get back to the bottom
00:21:42.78 --> 00:21:47.82 They'd say okay, who came in last place? Well, how many capital one guy won pallet? Yeah one guy for pallet
00:21:47.82 --> 00:21:52.22 It'd be like who okay, who came in last place? And I'd say I came in last place
00:21:52.70 --> 00:21:53.90 Then you got to do it again
00:21:53.90 --> 00:21:56.78 But the funniest was when you came back down
00:21:57.82 --> 00:22:01.42 If you were slow or they just wanted to hammer you more than to hey you're on fire
00:22:01.98 --> 00:22:03.18 Go go put it out
00:22:03.18 --> 00:22:06.06 It which means you got to run then your pallet down to the ocean oh
00:22:07.18 --> 00:22:09.98 And so so one time I came back down and
00:22:09.98 --> 00:22:16.54 And well one time I came back down and I said they said you have to request permission to land and one time I came back down and said
00:22:17.26 --> 00:22:19.26 I can't land them on fire
00:22:19.26 --> 00:22:20.30 And there they go
00:22:20.30 --> 00:22:27.98 Okay, but what was even better than that was a couple days later I came back down and I said request permission to touch and go
00:22:28.30 --> 00:22:32.94 Which you know, which in pilots is you know you land and then you take right back off so I just they go
00:22:33.82 --> 00:22:35.02 Permission granted
00:22:35.02 --> 00:22:42.54 Turn right right back up that's pretty funny isn't it doesn't that like just because basically that starts with just embracing the attitude
00:22:42.54 --> 00:22:44.86 Yeah, that's what it starts with have a good time
00:22:44.86 --> 00:22:49.34 Yeah, doesn't it result in all this crap with faceman that's that go get wet in sandy
00:22:49.34 --> 00:22:51.18 I mean from a normal standpoint
00:22:51.18 --> 00:22:56.86 Yeah, it's allegedly not fun. Yeah, so fun. Neither is the flight bro you explained that the flight is not cool
00:22:57.50 --> 00:23:01.02 But doing it that way it's just as hard kind of physically
00:23:01.02 --> 00:23:05.02 But the experience
00:23:07.02 --> 00:23:09.18 But the experience is a way better though
00:23:09.66 --> 00:23:14.30 And then yeah, we but we always had a good time when we were doing like we used to go on
00:23:14.30 --> 00:23:18.70 We're on a ship and then you go and the ship do something called an unwrap where you
00:23:19.18 --> 00:23:23.10 They load gear they load food and supplies and fuel from another ship and
00:23:23.90 --> 00:23:27.34 We would go help but we would turn it into like a sport
00:23:27.34 --> 00:23:33.90 Or we're trying to move as much boxes as we can and guys we're all sweating and just getting after it and instead of being in
00:23:33.90 --> 00:23:37.50 Is it a being because it's it's it's whatever it sucks right?
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:42.94 You got to go there and move a bunch of boxes like a moving party basically, but we actually turned it into a moving party
00:23:43.26 --> 00:23:49.82 And because it's on party we would go out that fun be laughing thrown stuff and and just basically getting after it
00:23:50.06 --> 00:23:52.06 Even those just labor
00:23:52.06 --> 00:23:54.06 But why not have a good time
00:23:54.06 --> 00:24:00.54 That's a good idea you got to you got to really man up with it for sure, but once you if you can kind of flip that switch
00:24:01.18 --> 00:24:03.50 But that's good. Yeah, it changes everything
00:24:03.50 --> 00:24:09.42 You when you get that good attitude going yeah, make it fun. It's good then those pallets
00:24:10.14 --> 00:24:16.14 Yeah, flights we used to or we do on quiet polihally huge beach huge sand
00:24:16.86 --> 00:24:18.86 You know to get to the beach
00:24:18.86 --> 00:24:25.10 Seven mile beach but they look nice make bonfires with those pallets oh yeah, yeah you can carry them up your back
00:24:25.10 --> 00:24:27.74 Oh, no, no, no, you the truck for sure
00:24:29.82 --> 00:24:31.82 Next question. Let's do it
00:24:31.98 --> 00:24:38.30 Do you have any recommendations for careers that are similar to the military and or careers that are based on leadership
00:24:38.94 --> 00:24:47.66 Contents just a context I applied to the Canadian armed forces to be a signals officer and I failed my medical signals officer
00:24:47.66 --> 00:24:54.06 You know that it yeah, it's basically a communications officer right right there. Okay, so yeah currently looking for alternatives
00:24:56.38 --> 00:25:02.70 Well, I'm not sure what the physical shortfall is I'm gonna assume that the physical shortfall was something that was
00:25:03.98 --> 00:25:07.34 Disqualified you from any type of millet
00:25:07.34 --> 00:25:10.94 So maybe you have really bad vision maybe you have really bad hearing in a year
00:25:10.94 --> 00:25:12.94 Maybe you have some irregular heart thing
00:25:12.94 --> 00:25:19.50 Maybe there's just some blood type you did something either there's a bunch of things that can do that to people
00:25:20.06 --> 00:25:24.86 And so I'm gonna assume that it was bad enough that you can't join the military at all. Okay
00:25:25.18 --> 00:25:30.38 The next thing is can you get into some kind of police or law enforcement that that's the next question because
00:25:30.86 --> 00:25:33.74 Maybe there's something that disqualifies you from the from the military
00:25:33.74 --> 00:25:40.22 But you could still get into police and law enforcement and by the way, you know if you can't get into that
00:25:40.22 --> 00:25:44.70 What kind of maybe some kind of an anti-terror agency?
00:25:45.74 --> 00:25:51.26 That you could possibly go into and I would say the next step from there is
00:25:52.06 --> 00:25:56.06 You know what kind of an intelligence agency could go work for you know what kind of a person you know
00:25:56.94 --> 00:25:58.94 Could you be a person that
00:25:58.94 --> 00:26:05.34 Learns a language that learns you know some technical skills that allows you to pursue people through the interwebs
00:26:05.34 --> 00:26:10.06 You know there's a lot of terror happening on the interwebs and it needs to be stopped
00:26:10.06 --> 00:26:13.10 So who's doing that cyber war cyber wars real?
00:26:13.10 --> 00:26:18.14 I mean, it's it's real so is there something that you could pursue in there and guess what you're doing it
00:26:19.02 --> 00:26:23.26 You're doing it virtually right but you're still hunting down terrorists and and
00:26:24.06 --> 00:26:28.54 Catching bad guys and preventing terror attacks so even though it's not you know
00:26:29.10 --> 00:26:34.38 Shoot in a machine gun it still is a has a huge impact and I'll tell you what in future in the future
00:26:34.38 --> 00:26:37.42 It might even have a bigger impact than the guys that are shooters
00:26:38.22 --> 00:26:44.62 So there's that there's that avenue to look at and same thing in in in law enforcement
00:26:44.62 --> 00:26:48.78 There's certain professions that you can get where you're not actually a police officer but you're a
00:26:49.90 --> 00:26:51.10 a
00:26:51.10 --> 00:26:52.70 You know a forensic
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:57.74 A forensic scientist that goes and looks at crime scenes and tries to figure out what happened so there's definitely some some
00:26:57.74 --> 00:27:03.82 Rhodes to go down there then there's firefighting of course there's being a paramedic
00:27:03.82 --> 00:27:11.02 That's another good one those are all all service based and so that's like a whole group right that's a whole thing
00:27:12.46 --> 00:27:15.98 And then let's say you can't do any of those things
00:27:16.62 --> 00:27:20.54 Well then what well for me, it's really easy
00:27:22.30 --> 00:27:24.30 construction
00:27:24.30 --> 00:27:32.14 We're engineering being a salesperson going into technology being a plumber being an electrician going into automotive
00:27:32.14 --> 00:27:39.50 Apprare automotive repair what like what all those jobs if you are getting after those jobs
00:27:39.82 --> 00:27:44.46 If they're all you can you can excel you can own your own company you can get after you can lead
00:27:45.02 --> 00:27:48.94 You can make a ton of money anyone those jobs you can make a ton of money any of them
00:27:48.94 --> 00:27:55.42 If you are a professional and you take pride in your work and you make I saw something the other day
00:27:55.42 --> 00:28:01.58 I wish I could find it. I try and posting it. It was just a plumber had obviously done this massive
00:28:02.54 --> 00:28:03.74 job
00:28:03.74 --> 00:28:08.62 Where all these pipes were all coming and going into one thing and and there was
00:28:09.34 --> 00:28:13.10 You know probably 20 or 30 little pieces of pipe
00:28:13.10 --> 00:28:19.74 But they were all perfectly aligned perfectly exact and it was in some you know storage
00:28:20.86 --> 00:28:26.78 Mechanical room but it just looked like so professional and that's the kind of thing that
00:28:27.34 --> 00:28:29.74 No matter what your job is what are you gonna do?
00:28:30.38 --> 00:28:33.34 Are you all you need to do is step up and
00:28:33.74 --> 00:28:39.02 Get after it and all those jobs any job that you're doing that your work that you're enjoy
00:28:39.02 --> 00:28:43.98 You know do something like you enjoy and what makes you enjoy things to me what makes you enjoy it
00:28:44.38 --> 00:28:50.46 Enjoy things is doing them well and practicing and getting good at them and having pride in your work. That's awesome. So
00:28:51.26 --> 00:28:53.26 I would say
00:28:53.26 --> 00:28:56.38 You know you gotta go get a find something that you like doing and
00:28:58.46 --> 00:29:00.46 Get after it
00:29:00.46 --> 00:29:01.50 you
00:29:01.50 --> 00:29:03.50 a lot of times
00:29:03.50 --> 00:29:10.54 Just in general source finding what you want to do you know sometimes you will like hey I like to
00:29:11.10 --> 00:29:11.98 I don't know
00:29:11.98 --> 00:29:14.86 Surf so I'm gonna go be a surf instructor or something like that
00:29:16.14 --> 00:29:17.82 usually how to find what you
00:29:19.42 --> 00:29:24.30 Want to do doesn't have to do directly. It's like what are the things that that
00:29:24.94 --> 00:29:28.22 Stimulate you were motivated you or whatever that that make you like
00:29:28.22 --> 00:29:34.14 Surfing or make you like whatever it's like so a lot of it is real like basics like I like problems
00:29:34.14 --> 00:29:37.26 Hullving this way or something like that so
00:29:38.30 --> 00:29:43.58 Tip there is look at what you like to do or like what you like to watch on for instance
00:29:43.58 --> 00:29:47.58 I like to work with my hands. Okay good then you need to be a carpenter
00:29:47.58 --> 00:29:51.34 You need to be a plumber you need to be in that direction. Oh, I like to work with my brain
00:29:51.74 --> 00:29:57.74 Okay, you like to solve problems. Okay, be calm a softener engineer where you're trying to figure out how to map all those things together or
00:29:57.74 --> 00:30:01.50 A statistic I like the numbers. I'm gonna be a stat so yes absolutely
00:30:01.74 --> 00:30:06.78 What are you interested in and then what job requires that type of mindset and skill?
00:30:07.26 --> 00:30:09.82 It's it's always fun because I work with so many different companies
00:30:10.70 --> 00:30:13.90 in every different industry and whenever I meet
00:30:14.62 --> 00:30:20.62 You know there's always a group of people that are just into their job right there into it
00:30:20.78 --> 00:30:26.70 And they want to be the best and it and it doesn't matter what it is and I've I've had you know
00:30:26.70 --> 00:30:30.70 I work with companies every different industry and sometimes I think to myself
00:30:31.82 --> 00:30:35.42 Well, this is a weird industry and I kind of I kind of you know just think you know
00:30:35.42 --> 00:30:39.02 It's weird that I'm going to work with this particular company because this is a weird industry
00:30:39.02 --> 00:30:45.58 And then I meet the person that's bringing me in and they're talking to me about their business like they're going into combat
00:30:46.30 --> 00:30:50.54 And I mean that in the most positive way. They're like hey, this is what we want to do this is our vision right here
00:30:50.54 --> 00:30:56.70 This and they're talking about you know selling shampoo. I mean you know what I mean like just some thing
00:30:57.50 --> 00:31:04.38 That that they're into and they just want to do the best that they can at it and that becomes a passion and a fuel so
00:31:04.94 --> 00:31:10.14 It's it's it's fun to watch it's fun to watch and it doesn't and it translates
00:31:10.14 --> 00:31:14.86 You know the attitude that they bring to it and the leadership that they bring to it translates into their whole life
00:31:14.86 --> 00:31:20.46 That's how well that's what makes people successful in business and life is when they're they bring that attitude
00:31:20.46 --> 00:31:25.26 If I'm going to I'm going to do this the best of my ability and I'm going to grow and I'm going to get better
00:31:25.26 --> 00:31:31.10 And I'm going to find my weaknesses and I'm going to work on those and next thing you know these people are owning their own businesses and it's awesome
00:31:35.34 --> 00:31:37.34 Next question let's do that
00:31:37.34 --> 00:31:43.34 Why do you never or rarely swear or use for
00:31:45.02 --> 00:31:46.30 Yeah, bro, what are you never
00:31:47.18 --> 00:31:52.06 Anyway, that's part of part A and the question why do you never swear or use for vanity be part B the question is
00:31:53.26 --> 00:31:56.30 What do you do to combat burnout?
00:31:57.02 --> 00:32:03.10 This my schedule isn't helping I'm a prosecutor constantly overrun with violence and despair up
00:32:03.10 --> 00:32:08.06 at 5 a.m. to play music or read a jiu jitsu purple belt
00:32:08.70 --> 00:32:11.50 Trying to keep up with the monster the young monsters on the mat
00:32:12.54 --> 00:32:16.94 But never seem to have enough time because life is always making huge demands
00:32:17.74 --> 00:32:23.18 And trying to get better at gymnastics strength training without neglecting my wife and my dog
00:32:23.90 --> 00:32:27.34 Thanks for encouraging us regular folks to dig a little deeper and try a little harder
00:32:28.78 --> 00:32:30.78 well
00:32:30.78 --> 00:32:35.82 The swearing question we actually talked about that already on one of the earlier podcasts. I don't know which number
00:32:36.62 --> 00:32:44.22 But it's covered in great detail. I think it's an 18-minute conversation. Let's not rehash that one and just to clear clarify that it
00:32:44.94 --> 00:32:50.86 More appropriate we'll just say a question would be to modify this. Why do you never or rarely swear on?
00:32:51.58 --> 00:32:55.34 Why are you recording that is true because you get your swear on from time to time?
00:32:55.90 --> 00:32:58.38 I well not I have used I give myself
00:32:58.38 --> 00:33:02.54 6 foul language usage is per month
00:33:03.34 --> 00:33:10.62 Outside you know outside reporting yeah, I'm just kidding. Yes, I do swear. I think it it's it's
00:33:11.42 --> 00:33:16.30 I think that is the rule. I don't know if it's cool or not, but I do do it
00:33:17.10 --> 00:33:22.86 But I don't swear here and I don't swear when I'm presenting and I don't swear in front of my wife and kids and I
00:33:23.26 --> 00:33:25.26 Really that in front of your wife
00:33:25.26 --> 00:33:29.26 Not really not say that's bad enough, but that's interesting. I'm really sure. I mean
00:33:30.70 --> 00:33:36.38 I try and get give her some respect and treat you know speak in fact when I do swear in front of her
00:33:36.46 --> 00:33:39.66 I do it knowingly that I'm trying to make some kind of a
00:33:40.62 --> 00:33:48.38 Statement about some like I'm just sizing yeah really emphasize something. Okay, okay, so cool man. That's good. Okay, okay now let's get to the
00:33:48.86 --> 00:33:50.86 Combatting burnout first of all sounds like
00:33:50.86 --> 00:33:57.98 Uh this guy right here has a lot going on which is awesome good for you. That's killer. Welcome to life
00:33:58.62 --> 00:34:01.26 Right now a couple things right
00:34:02.86 --> 00:34:05.74 And I guess this might be a little rude of them tonight, but you kind of make it fun
00:34:05.98 --> 00:34:09.50 Right instead of viewing these things like an oppressive grind
00:34:10.22 --> 00:34:12.22 I mean just the way that
00:34:12.22 --> 00:34:18.86 You know and the mats like on the mats. I don't have to time and life is making huge demands and I'm trying just to make try to do just
00:34:18.86 --> 00:34:23.90 Gymnastic strength training, but without neglecting my wife and it's like everything is a grind no it's not
00:34:24.06 --> 00:34:26.94 You have the opportunity to do gymna you got a wife and you got a dog
00:34:27.50 --> 00:34:31.58 That's that's that's awesome as echo would say that's dope right there
00:34:32.22 --> 00:34:34.22 So what
00:34:34.46 --> 00:34:37.82 You know instead of looking at him like that let's look at him at
00:34:38.94 --> 00:34:45.98 What we can do to get more done okay first of all what kind of time constraints can you put on things right force yourself to do some things faster?
00:34:46.78 --> 00:34:48.78 Okay
00:34:48.78 --> 00:34:54.54 For instance reading first thing in the morning. I don't know. I don't agree with that like why would you get up in the morning and read?
00:34:55.10 --> 00:34:59.58 Reading no end of the day. Okay playing music first thing in the morning
00:35:00.30 --> 00:35:06.06 Playing music should should be fun and enjoyable as should be so getting up and going okay
00:35:06.06 --> 00:35:08.30 I'm gonna go play music you're turning it into a labor
00:35:09.10 --> 00:35:11.10 Right you're turning it into a labor
00:35:11.26 --> 00:35:14.70 It should be something that's down and why winding you down at the end of the night
00:35:14.70 --> 00:35:24.06 So when you wake up in the morning do something that requires some discipline and and has you get after it a little bit and wakes you up a little bit more right
00:35:25.26 --> 00:35:26.86 You know another thing is you know
00:35:26.86 --> 00:35:32.06 Judiciter how this is a weird question how fast can you train you get to because
00:35:33.18 --> 00:35:40.38 I can tell you for many many years and also what part of you did to is important to you and what part of you're getting the most out of because for many many years
00:35:40.38 --> 00:35:44.38 Especially once the war started when I I would show up to train
00:35:45.74 --> 00:35:49.58 Basically at the at the end of class and I still do this sometimes
00:35:49.58 --> 00:35:55.26 I show up when Dean is done teaching when Jeff is done teaching believe me if I had unlimited hours
00:35:55.26 --> 00:35:59.26 I would set their an absorb everything that they have to say I learned something from Dean the other day
00:36:00.46 --> 00:36:03.98 I couldn't believe it I couldn't believe what I learned from Dean the other day
00:36:03.98 --> 00:36:06.38 I couldn't believe that I didn't know it
00:36:06.38 --> 00:36:13.02 I couldn't believe that I didn't know it I couldn't believe how well it worked and I couldn't believe that that bastard never taught it to me
00:36:13.18 --> 00:36:19.18 Which made me really angry but that's the way it is I've been training for 20 years and he taught me a basic
00:36:20.14 --> 00:36:24.22 Fundamental thing that I did not know so if I could I of course I'd be in their all time
00:36:24.22 --> 00:36:29.42 You know learning absorbing Glovers the same way Glover teaches you little things and he goes oh, you should do this right
00:36:29.42 --> 00:36:34.38 You know how man how did I not know that so I would learn all I could but I don't have much time time for that
00:36:34.38 --> 00:36:39.02 So what do I do show up when that's up so and I go in I train get it on and and
00:36:40.86 --> 00:36:46.46 How fast is it so I'm saying it's how fast can you what what gets you the most
00:36:47.18 --> 00:36:54.30 Impact in the shortest amount of time so for me it's always feel if I don't have time to take an hour and a half class
00:36:55.10 --> 00:37:00.38 That's you know a 10 minute warmup a 30 minutes or 40 minutes of instruction
00:37:00.38 --> 00:37:06.38 10 minutes 20 minutes of drilling and then half an hour of rolling and however long that all put together is but
00:37:06.86 --> 00:37:12.94 But I'm gonna show up for me the most important part at this juncture in my jitzu career is the rolling
00:37:13.26 --> 00:37:17.66 So I'm gonna show up for that last you know 40 minutes 45 minutes. I'm gonna get my rounds in
00:37:17.82 --> 00:37:23.26 Maybe that's what you need to do because you can't you know have time to take an hour and a half class with all that other stuff
00:37:23.58 --> 00:37:25.58 so
00:37:25.58 --> 00:37:28.94 See if you can do that the other thing you might have to do is prioritize an execute the
00:37:28.94 --> 00:37:37.10 The the extra curricular activities right what you got gymnastics alone you got BJJ going on you got reading you got music going on
00:37:37.42 --> 00:37:39.42 how do you
00:37:40.46 --> 00:37:42.46 How do you bring those things
00:37:42.78 --> 00:37:45.66 Together or how do you prioritize them so that you're
00:37:46.54 --> 00:37:48.06 You focus on
00:37:48.06 --> 00:37:54.22 Which one's gonna be the most important that's the bottom line right because you might not have time to do everything and so you might be just
00:37:54.22 --> 00:38:00.06 Dabbling in all of them and not making any progress in any of them. Oh, yeah, so that's not good. Another thing
00:38:01.02 --> 00:38:03.02 How can you manipulate your work schedule?
00:38:03.66 --> 00:38:09.90 Right what can you do at your work schedule that you could squeeze something in for instance
00:38:11.34 --> 00:38:13.34 Do people take a lunch break?
00:38:13.34 --> 00:38:19.10 Do people take a lunch break? I haven't taken lunch in the in the sealed teams. I didn't take lunch
00:38:19.10 --> 00:38:24.06 You know in why would you take lunch like oh I'm gonna go for an hour of
00:38:24.78 --> 00:38:29.50 Time and go to a place and sit down and eat no. I'm gonna eat in my desk while I'm working
00:38:29.50 --> 00:38:34.22 So I'm never gonna take lunch so maybe during your work people are you know people hey
00:38:34.22 --> 00:38:37.18 We're gonna go down to have some lunch cool. That's what I'm gonna go do you know
00:38:37.50 --> 00:38:39.10 500 burpees or whatever
00:38:39.10 --> 00:38:41.74 We're gonna go run to the gym real quick and get a workout and I'm gonna do my super principal whatever
00:38:42.22 --> 00:38:44.22 So see what what can you do there?
00:38:44.22 --> 00:38:49.82 Maybe maybe you could get more work done in this time when you're waking up early because you want to get after it
00:38:49.90 --> 00:38:56.70 Maybe that's the time when you should go to the job because no one's gonna bother you can get a bunch of work done and then you can take a break from
00:38:57.82 --> 00:39:02.06 From seven until nine when the rest of everyone's coming in with their coffee and want to talk to you
00:39:02.06 --> 00:39:05.42 No, that's when you're working out or that's when you're doing something else. So how can you
00:39:05.42 --> 00:39:13.66 Maximize I used to do this when we stuff to write evaluations for all of our guys and it's a big pain in the navy and
00:39:14.62 --> 00:39:17.66 They have to be perfect and they're getting a recording guys record so you want to re-perfect
00:39:17.66 --> 00:39:20.94 You want to take the effort because this is how the guys get evaluated so they can get advanced
00:39:21.10 --> 00:39:23.10 So you want to take your time with it, but
00:39:23.50 --> 00:39:26.78 During during we'd get you know, I was in charge
00:39:26.78 --> 00:39:33.10 I get these big stacks of e-values that have to go through and it's corrected some basically doing corrections of papers over and over and over again until they're perfect
00:39:33.10 --> 00:39:35.10 And it's meticulous
00:39:36.62 --> 00:39:39.50 Work and so what I would do is during that time period
00:39:40.14 --> 00:39:43.98 It would take like a month to get it done. I wouldn't work out first thing in the morning
00:39:43.98 --> 00:39:48.38 I would go to work immediately in the morning and while everyone else was either not there or
00:39:48.94 --> 00:39:52.86 I would work I would work and then when everyone showed up you know at
00:39:53.74 --> 00:39:58.38 11 I'd go work out during lunch and just you know if you want to come talk to me because everyone always wants to talk to you right
00:39:58.38 --> 00:40:00.38 Right, I'm gonna say to you
00:40:00.38 --> 00:40:03.42 Again, just leave me alone because I'm trying to work but
00:40:03.98 --> 00:40:09.66 Maybe you so how can you manipulate your work to to maximize what you're getting out of it
00:40:11.18 --> 00:40:16.30 Another thing is maybe take a little break from some of the activities maybe take a break from music
00:40:16.30 --> 00:40:21.34 Maybe take a break from or maybe you say oh you know what I've been doing an hour of music a day
00:40:21.34 --> 00:40:23.58 You know I'm gonna change that I'm gonna do for the next month
00:40:23.58 --> 00:40:28.22 I'm only gonna do 15 minutes just to keep my keep my skills
00:40:28.22 --> 00:40:31.66 Maintain but I'm not gonna progress and progress and I understand that
00:40:32.70 --> 00:40:35.58 And or maybe you take a break from the mats for two weeks
00:40:35.58 --> 00:40:40.86 I can tell you if you're training every day a two week break from the mat in many cases myself
00:40:40.86 --> 00:40:44.14 Definitely I take a jump up I get better if I take a break
00:40:44.70 --> 00:40:45.98 That's why I travel for me
00:40:45.98 --> 00:40:50.54 I don't like it when it goes on all the time but I go away for six days and don't train
00:40:51.02 --> 00:40:54.94 I come back and I feel a little bit better after some stuff jellies on the brain so
00:40:54.94 --> 00:41:02.62 Yeah, I have no problem that used to my dean once I became home from deployment and
00:41:03.10 --> 00:41:09.74 Deen and I were training and I was just so fired up, you know coming and I was kind of smashing him and I'm yelling at him
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:13.10 You're hopping on deployment. I've been overseas. What have you been doing back here?
00:41:13.10 --> 00:41:19.10 I'm almost rushing you. Bob, I'm just crushing him that day and so he went home that night and he made us
00:41:19.10 --> 00:41:25.18 He's when he had to burn this is when you had to burn CDs. He made it. He made a CD that was called killed jocca
00:41:25.18 --> 00:41:27.18 That's all of his favorite whatever
00:41:28.06 --> 00:41:33.42 Metal songs and he came back and the next day came back and destroyed me. He did kill jocca that next day, but
00:41:35.26 --> 00:41:37.26 Yeah, so taking a break sometime just to
00:41:38.06 --> 00:41:41.82 Just to focus on some of the other stuff the other thing. Okay. You got your wife and your dog
00:41:41.82 --> 00:41:49.34 Spent time with them while you're doing these activities, right? Your dog can go running with you, right?
00:41:49.34 --> 00:41:52.70 That's awesome. Your dog can come to the park watch you do pull-ups
00:41:53.26 --> 00:41:55.02 Right your dog can
00:41:55.02 --> 00:42:00.22 Chase the kettlebell that you're that you're throwing or whatever the the shop put or the medicine ball
00:42:00.22 --> 00:42:04.62 You can you can have be careful if you're feeling your kettlebell. Yeah, that might have been bad bad advice
00:42:05.66 --> 00:42:10.94 You know you feel kettlebells. I was with my buddy. We were in New Jersey one time and we went through kettlebells
00:42:10.94 --> 00:42:17.18 It was winter time and we were throwing kettlebells and the kettlebells would get it was part of the work out
00:42:17.18 --> 00:42:19.98 We had to dig the kettlebell back up out of the mud
00:42:20.54 --> 00:42:25.26 It was pretty funny anyways, so what at my point we say that if you threw your kettlebell and hit a dog
00:42:25.66 --> 00:42:27.82 It would not be good, so don't do that one
00:42:27.82 --> 00:42:30.94 But take your dog with you to park go have fun hang out and
00:42:31.50 --> 00:42:32.86 Same thing with your wife
00:42:32.86 --> 00:42:38.22 You know what your wife doesn't want to do some jiu jitsu my wife did jiu jitsu before she was pregnant so much
00:42:38.22 --> 00:42:44.22 She was coming to the gym with me all the time she was training and then you're just let's bring it into the family a little bit get her in she
00:42:44.70 --> 00:42:52.78 Genastics get your Tim Ferris acro yoga on with with your girl right? That's the same thing get her in the game
00:42:53.66 --> 00:42:59.66 Have her lay down some vocal tracks right got me a little backing vocals from mama
00:43:00.06 --> 00:43:02.06 Let's hear what that sounds like
00:43:02.06 --> 00:43:07.98 And that way you're doing the stuff that you want to do which you're bringing your family into the game a little bit and
00:43:08.78 --> 00:43:10.78 Like I said man have fun
00:43:11.18 --> 00:43:12.54 because
00:43:12.54 --> 00:43:16.94 All these things that you're talking about even being a prosecutor which I'm sure like you said in bed
00:43:16.94 --> 00:43:22.14 You and just violence and disturbing things all the time and it's a challenging job, but
00:43:23.18 --> 00:43:27.34 But enjoy that challenge and how can you do it better and how can you win? You know
00:43:27.90 --> 00:43:29.90 I'm gonna have fun with it
00:43:29.90 --> 00:43:35.58 I had fun all the time had fun overseas I had fun and I rack I had fun on the in the
00:43:35.58 --> 00:43:39.02 Bows of a ship will I was deployed on for six months?
00:43:39.10 --> 00:43:47.34 I'm gonna have fun and and laugh hysterically at things and it's the same thing with with music and with working out and jiu jitsu and you gotta
00:43:48.78 --> 00:43:53.82 You gotta enjoy them all and just like when you're on the mat you're competing against these young monsters
00:43:54.14 --> 00:43:57.34 It's just trying compete with everybody just trying get better
00:43:57.34 --> 00:43:59.34 Hmm
00:43:59.02 --> 00:44:02.86 Because that is winning and and that's what's gonna make you better than long run
00:44:04.38 --> 00:44:06.38 Because I don't make you stick with things
00:44:07.74 --> 00:44:13.10 Make you stick with them because if you don't enjoy jiu jitsu, why would you do it for 25 years if you don't enjoy
00:44:13.90 --> 00:44:20.46 Music, why would you keep practicing it so my final thought on this man my brother have some fun with this stuff
00:44:22.38 --> 00:44:27.26 Yeah, the dang and being a prosecutor. That's the kind of job where even when you go
00:44:27.26 --> 00:44:30.70 Home, bro, it's still in your mind, you know, so
00:44:31.74 --> 00:44:37.98 It's for the whole experience. It's like dang. This is my job is taking up so much time. It's true. So
00:44:39.42 --> 00:44:43.66 Yeah, I would imagine that would make it more of an like a difficult
00:44:44.30 --> 00:44:50.22 Yeah, you gotta figure out that way to leave your job at work. Yeah, we want to work sell at it
00:44:50.22 --> 00:44:56.22 I just had this conversation with guy today just because if you're looking at your you can't
00:44:57.26 --> 00:45:03.26 The way you're gonna do your bot job better as a prosecutor is not by just being 100% focused on that
00:45:03.34 --> 00:45:05.50 100% of the time. Yeah, you will not do a better job
00:45:06.14 --> 00:45:12.46 If you do good job if you focus on that a lot and you still do jitsu and you still train and you still get after it
00:45:12.46 --> 00:45:17.90 You still you that how many good ideas? I have so many good ideas that come to me when I'm working out when
00:45:17.90 --> 00:45:22.62 Um, doing yard work because you gotta you gotta give your brain a little space to think
00:45:23.18 --> 00:45:29.10 It's just like planning a seal operation if you're sitting there looking at the map from two inches away the whole day
00:45:29.10 --> 00:45:33.66 Trying to get this plan perfect. You're not gonna see everything and it's the same thing with any job that you have
00:45:33.66 --> 00:45:37.58 If you get yourself totally wrapped around that job you're not gonna have the proper the
00:45:38.38 --> 00:45:41.58 Detachment from the job to see the bigger picture
00:45:41.82 --> 00:45:46.30 So you must get some space between you and your job so you can think properly
00:45:46.30 --> 00:45:50.86 Yeah, and just like and that other element like everything you do
00:45:51.90 --> 00:45:57.90 Studying working out is like this where you you you work hard you get your reps and then you get your rest
00:45:58.22 --> 00:46:02.06 You can't be doing pushups all day every single day. You know you won't get stronger actually
00:46:02.06 --> 00:46:05.26 Right, so when you know just like studying where they say like yeah
00:46:05.26 --> 00:46:09.82 I guess when you study or memorize and or both whatever and then you go to sleep that's when they get
00:46:10.46 --> 00:46:12.06 your neural
00:46:11.90 --> 00:46:15.42 Connections get solidified get so yeah when you sleep
00:46:15.42 --> 00:46:20.14 That's not when you're studying so if you're driving for a test for two days straight no sleeping, you know
00:46:20.46 --> 00:46:22.22 That won't help you as much as
00:46:22.22 --> 00:46:25.10 Signing for four hours properly getting some good sleep
00:46:25.10 --> 00:46:28.90 Yeah, so that's the same thing with the job. You know get grind on the job
00:46:28.90 --> 00:46:31.42 Yep, and then man forget about it for a little bit when you come back
00:46:31.42 --> 00:46:33.50 It'll make me better. It'll make me better. It's weird
00:46:34.14 --> 00:46:37.74 Coincidentally that's what I just said happens at your exit. Exactly. You're right just say
00:46:37.74 --> 00:46:44.70 Yeah, you know exactly right and a little tip in on and off this would it I know this because I know how that feels when you're like
00:46:44.70 --> 00:46:50.62 Dang I work so much and I don't have time to go work out or whatever or I'm always pressed for time
00:46:50.62 --> 00:46:52.70 Or whatever you can kind of overlap the two so
00:46:53.34 --> 00:47:00.46 What I did okay I'd go to work and then right after work I'd go home had changed and then I'd go to the gym and then I'd be like man
00:47:00.46 --> 00:47:05.58 I don't have time for anything if I expect to work out as much as I need to in my mind or as much as I want
00:47:05.58 --> 00:47:09.82 I kind of have time for anything else. I just think you kind of do have time when you start to overlap
00:47:09.82 --> 00:47:15.18 So and this is some real obvious and simple but sometimes you kind of you miss these little things so
00:47:15.70 --> 00:47:19.38 What I ended up doing which a lot of people do is they'll just you just bring your workout clothes
00:47:19.38 --> 00:47:23.82 You're pretty workout to the to work to work and then go straight to the gym
00:47:24.62 --> 00:47:28.42 Saved yourself all kinds of time. Yes, you actually got your workout
00:47:28.70 --> 00:47:34.70 You saved 40 minutes. Yes, by doing that that was your workout and that and that's not to mention you when you go home a lot
00:47:34.70 --> 00:47:39.82 Have this a lot of time it's subconscious to it so you start to just melt about your horrible
00:47:39.82 --> 00:47:44.18 My mela so the chance of you skipping a workout becomes I that's a that's a different thing for sure
00:47:44.18 --> 00:47:48.82 But that seems like an obvious thing. You know, I can't bring your if you're gonna work out after work
00:47:48.82 --> 00:47:50.82 It seems obvious. I know but
00:47:51.70 --> 00:47:56.000 There's other things just like that in like life for let me just overlap them
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.16 You know just like eating lunch at your desk. Yeah, they made great up. It's just straight up efficiency
00:48:01.16 --> 00:48:06.50 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so do a whole podcast on just how to be more efficient. Yeah, so if you're keeping your eyes open for okay
00:48:06.50 --> 00:48:11.96 How can I go overlapped here or left there and you'll be like all day? I got two hours at the end of the day right now
00:48:12.44 --> 00:48:15.38 Or just more time to do more stuff, you know, yeah
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:20.20 So just keep your eyes open man and the jujitsu thing to back to the jujitsu real quick the
00:48:21.14 --> 00:48:26.56 You said try to focus on like the parts that that help you the most like come in, you know
00:48:27.08 --> 00:48:29.18 Don't quote unquote
00:48:29.18 --> 00:48:33.44 For lack of editor waste your time on like the warm up and you know if that's not where you get the most learning
00:48:34.34 --> 00:48:39.98 Before you do that clear it with the instructor. Oh, yeah, it's right. It's just I don't dig it when you just skip the warm up
00:48:39.98 --> 00:48:44.54 Rolling when it's time to roll. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like a thing so you got to you had to say like a lot like
00:48:44.54 --> 00:48:47.42 I'll do that. I'll do that. I'll come to your instructor and say hey
00:48:47.42 --> 00:48:48.94 I'm working a bunch right now
00:48:48.94 --> 00:48:55.72 I got this case going on and I got to get through it and so I'm only gonna come three times a week and all I have time for just to come in and roll
00:48:55.72 --> 00:49:00.10 Is that cool with you? What are they gonna say no? Yeah, or just add this time?
00:49:00.40 --> 00:49:04.44 Cuz if you say I can only have time to roll there like oh you want to skip my lesson then
00:49:04.44 --> 00:49:10.04 That's the parking shows just get so you say I can only come in at this time. Well, I've been in that situation
00:49:10.76 --> 00:49:14.68 Where you know I've been working on this thing and and also other schedules
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.62 I had my new baby and all this stuff so it's like dang the only time I can come in
00:49:19.08 --> 00:49:21.08 Realistically
00:49:21.08 --> 00:49:24.76 Was that to get there at the 1235
00:49:24.76 --> 00:49:26.76 Just to get your all in yeah
00:49:27.12 --> 00:49:31.32 One you know the one the land, you know the instructions starts at noon and then I
00:49:31.82 --> 00:49:34.22 I know Jeff was like yeah
00:49:34.22 --> 00:49:37.96 Yeah, you know how your belt things you can just roll. I don't know if you thought this or not
00:49:37.96 --> 00:49:41.64 It's probably meeting I felt it but it could have been me being paranoid
00:49:41.64 --> 00:49:43.98 Great encourages that by the way great train
00:49:44.52 --> 00:49:50.48 Encourages if you get more out of just rolling then you do the lesson like when you get to a certain belt and you're you know
00:49:50.48 --> 00:49:56.20 You're learning starts to take shape like what you learn better. He encourages but the only thing is that like I just
00:49:56.72 --> 00:49:59.000 Just saying what I just learned from Dean the other day and
00:49:59.84 --> 00:50:05.20 How what other things have I missed yeah, but that's an opportunity cost situation. You know
00:50:05.84 --> 00:50:07.84 Dang that's important stuff
00:50:07.84 --> 00:50:09.84 Yeah, but
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:11.84 What I do is I always
00:50:12.24 --> 00:50:14.08 Like even if I'm if I get there a little late
00:50:14.08 --> 00:50:17.80 I'll be like I'll look and see what moves they showed and and I'll
00:50:17.80 --> 00:50:23.08 And I'll figure out if there's anything I didn't know yeah, how can you figure out if this something you didn't know?
00:50:23.08 --> 00:50:27.08 No, because I say what did you do today or I'll watch guys if what you guys learn what you guys go over today
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:28.84 And that's all this now, but hey Jeff how does that work?
00:50:28.84 --> 00:50:32.20 But I'll say hey Dean what's this thing here? So I'll just ask him you know
00:50:32.92 --> 00:50:37.88 Basically retakes the whole class. No, no, I reach because he because like you just said my learning is developed
00:50:37.88 --> 00:50:40.60 So all they need to say is hey we went over this escape right here
00:50:40.60 --> 00:50:43.40 We went over this finish and here's how you do it over this transition
00:50:44.52 --> 00:50:47.44 Yeah, but that one yeah, you got to kind of cut me any kid
00:50:47.44 --> 00:50:51.04 Spectch you know respect respect respect your instruction
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:53.52 Wow, yeah, totally got up
00:50:54.96 --> 00:50:56.32 Next question
00:50:56.32 --> 00:50:58.96 I've encountered an issue in the workplace
00:51:00.08 --> 00:51:03.92 I've never dealt with before I'm a former Air Force STO
00:51:04.72 --> 00:51:09.12 STO yeah, this like a combat controller. They call in they call in
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:15.36 Aircraft they set up they call for fire. They set up they set up air strips in the field
00:51:15.36 --> 00:51:21.36 Real cool job. Okay, as it says here or as you may affectionate lean no us as combat control. Okay
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:27.60 I'm not civilian mechanical engineer. Thank you. Begot in the oil and gas industry
00:51:28.16 --> 00:51:32.40 Through attrition the people I work closely with have learned a little about
00:51:33.12 --> 00:51:35.12 What it is I used to do
00:51:35.60 --> 00:51:41.20 I'm treated noticeably different as a result for example some refer to me as mr. sf now
00:51:41.20 --> 00:51:45.28 My current approach is just to laugh it off and ignore it
00:51:45.52 --> 00:51:49.20 But how can I respectfully indicate that when I'm in the office
00:51:50.64 --> 00:51:53.44 I'm not that anymore and no different than anyone
00:51:55.68 --> 00:51:58.16 Well, I think you're taking the right approach and that is to ignore it
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:02.56 I think there's probably
00:52:03.60 --> 00:52:10.64 Something about your history right that people get a little bit either intimidated or come with in some way because they think all of a sudden
00:52:10.64 --> 00:52:16.48 You know you're you're this different type of thing, but I think it is definitely something where
00:52:17.04 --> 00:52:18.32 Well
00:52:18.32 --> 00:52:21.52 In the seal teams the minute you say hey don't call me that
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:27.36 Like people that's we got your nickname for life if you say that so
00:52:28.80 --> 00:52:30.80 You know I think
00:52:31.12 --> 00:52:35.60 You know for one thing it sounds like you're not referring back to your time in the service on a lot but
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:40.40 Another thing is don't a subtle thing is don't answer to you know
00:52:40.88 --> 00:52:44.80 Mr. sf just don't answer to no not saying you have to be a jerk about it
00:52:45.28 --> 00:52:54.08 But if someone says mr. sf hey mr. sf and just like keep doing what you're doing until and so don't reinforce that that's what they should call you
00:52:54.48 --> 00:52:56.48 Right this is like a basic
00:52:57.68 --> 00:53:03.44 A basic thing but I think you're doing the right thing and I mean if you ever wanted to say something about it again
00:53:03.44 --> 00:53:08.24 The minute you say something about it now. Well, so it turns into a big deal now people are whispering like a he doesn't like to talk about it
00:53:08.24 --> 00:53:10.24 Right right so now we're that's a situation
00:53:11.92 --> 00:53:20.80 So man just ignore it keep working and I mean carry on with your with your mission with these with these guys in the gas
00:53:20.80 --> 00:53:24.16 So there's a bunch of veterans in the gas oil industry. I don't know why they're you know
00:53:24.16 --> 00:53:31.36 I'm when we work with gas oil is a you know a bunch of that's maybe that's more on the front line troopers, but man I'm in a bunch of no a bunch of veterans
00:53:33.36 --> 00:53:35.36 So I don't know maybe maybe they
00:53:36.32 --> 00:53:41.52 Maybe they saw a little a little reaction they got from you. Yeah, so let's make sure we're not doing that just
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:48.80 Ignore it and carry on the best thing you can do right in no in the seal teams if somebody does something that annoys you do not
00:53:48.80 --> 00:53:55.12 Show it same thing like my family with my kids man when my kids figure out that something annoying
00:53:55.12 --> 00:53:56.56 One of my other kids they just
00:53:57.20 --> 00:54:02.88 Relantless annihilation with that whatever that thing is and I did that when I was a kid
00:54:02.88 --> 00:54:06.56 I was you know my sisters and I weird so mean to each other on
00:54:07.12 --> 00:54:11.84 Whatever and that's sort of I don't know I guess that's sort of a tradition in my family is you know
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:18.24 It's sort of a tradition is of no emotional mercy right if you find something you're just gonna grind on it
00:54:18.24 --> 00:54:23.52 And that's the way it works and also no credit no credit will be given
00:54:24.88 --> 00:54:27.28 There's no credit will be given you know, it's like oh
00:54:27.84 --> 00:54:29.84 Yeah, whatever
00:54:29.52 --> 00:54:31.04 So
00:54:31.04 --> 00:54:36.56 But yeah, man ignore it they'll get over it kind of like on Lionheart remember to Lionheart when he's like
00:54:36.56 --> 00:54:41.20 He's a van Dam movie man anyway. He goes into the final thing against a big guy
00:54:41.20 --> 00:54:44.64 Do another podcast without me when you talk about cheesy movies
00:54:44.64 --> 00:54:49.44 I'm telling you to say it doesn't matter the movie choose you're not it's exact same concept. You can't show it
00:54:49.44 --> 00:54:51.44 So he goes in broken rip
00:54:51.44 --> 00:54:54.08 All the money's on you know the table whatever
00:54:55.36 --> 00:54:58.64 Broken rib is like he gets hit in the rib. Oh no, he doesn't get hit in the rib
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:04.000 He like he goes to hit him and there are any flinches like all quick and the guy that big guy is fighting
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.80 He boom he flinches all quick. He goes
00:55:08.16 --> 00:55:10.64 Seems saying oh, I can't show that. No
00:55:11.76 --> 00:55:13.12 Good
00:55:13.12 --> 00:55:20.88 Is it ever okay? This is next question by the next question. Yeah. Yeah, sure. All right. This isn't just my question. I'm bushing out in the middle of that last one
00:55:20.88 --> 00:55:22.88 Okay, yeah
00:55:22.88 --> 00:55:26.56 Is it ever okay to violate core values to achieve a goal?
00:55:28.88 --> 00:55:30.88 Okay, so first of all
00:55:31.04 --> 00:55:35.76 Really obvious your values and your goals should be aligned
00:55:36.80 --> 00:55:40.64 They should not be adversarial they shouldn't be counter to each other and
00:55:40.64 --> 00:55:47.44 If you think about what your goals are your goals should be set up in a way that they support your values and vice versa
00:55:47.44 --> 00:55:54.56 That's just the way it is. I'm not sure where this is gonna be an issue if you're setting up goals that are contrary to your values
00:55:54.56 --> 00:55:56.56 You got some issues now. I guess
00:55:57.68 --> 00:56:02.80 If you had the goal of winning the blue belt jujitsu championships
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:06.88 And in order to win you you cheated like you
00:56:06.88 --> 00:56:12.72 Clean someone as reaping your leg and you said oh you tap and you get the guy to qualify it and you win that's could be an example
00:56:12.72 --> 00:56:18.08 Right now do I support that no you know that's wrong you you go winning against the values of
00:56:18.56 --> 00:56:21.60 Actually the values of martial arts to do that so you didn't win anything
00:56:21.60 --> 00:56:23.60 You didn't achieve your goal because you weren't actually the best
00:56:24.64 --> 00:56:27.60 So I say no on that one another one
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:32.88 Let's say you wanted to make a certain level of profit at your company
00:56:32.88 --> 00:56:40.48 So you cheated a little bit on the quality of the manufacturing you sold items that weren't quite reliable
00:56:42.16 --> 00:56:47.44 Do I support that no right for animal and why let me tell you why because your goal
00:56:48.40 --> 00:56:52.48 Your goal is not even aligned with your goal itself because when you start making
00:56:53.36 --> 00:56:58.72 Substandard manufactured items what's gonna happen in the long run people can say we don't like these
00:56:58.96 --> 00:57:00.96 We're not gonna buy him anymore so
00:57:00.96 --> 00:57:06.32 You didn't win you might have one of the short term, but you didn't win and and again you're going against your value
00:57:06.32 --> 00:57:08.32 You should have values that you don't want to
00:57:09.84 --> 00:57:15.28 You know take profit over making good product and again in the long run
00:57:15.84 --> 00:57:19.68 That value is gonna cost you right people aren't gonna want to buy your product anymore
00:57:22.32 --> 00:57:27.36 Okay another one I could think like let's say your goal was to lose weight or to gain weight or whatever
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:29.52 Some kind of positive
00:57:29.52 --> 00:57:31.52 Physical change
00:57:31.52 --> 00:57:36.08 Answer your working on it, but then you decide you're gonna jump on the steroids right you're gonna jump on steroids
00:57:37.12 --> 00:57:40.56 And and you get that goal right because steroids are a huge advantage
00:57:40.56 --> 00:57:45.76 But again, I say no because if you think about what your goal is like why are you trying to
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:49.36 Gain weight or lose weight your goal is to be is to be healthy
00:57:49.60 --> 00:57:55.84 Right that's your value is you value your health and so when the minute you start doing something that's countered your health
00:57:55.84 --> 00:57:59.36 Well, that's not that's not helping your long term
00:57:59.84 --> 00:58:04.32 It's your value is not aligned with your goal and your goal is not aligned with your value so get them lined up
00:58:07.44 --> 00:58:09.44 So now
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:16.88 Might we at some point compromise our values compromise our values to reach a goal?
00:58:16.88 --> 00:58:20.40 I think that changes the answer a little bit right we might compromise
00:58:21.04 --> 00:58:24.56 Remember that question that we had about the people that are snakes and how do you work with them?
00:58:24.56 --> 00:58:31.76 You know, should you work with someone that's dishonest or backstabbing but they're a cog in the machine of your team and
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:35.28 Your values
00:58:35.28 --> 00:58:41.52 Right they might be to call the person out and say you're a you're a backstabber and I don't want to work with you
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:46.000 That might be what your values tell you to do but your goal
00:58:47.12 --> 00:58:51.60 And if you do that you first of all you don't progress you don't your team doesn't work better together
00:58:51.60 --> 00:58:56.96 They work worse together and so in the long run you don't win
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.64 Because you stuck hard core with your values and
00:59:01.68 --> 00:59:08.16 By the way if you stick with your if you if you bend your values you compromise your values a little bit to get through this transitional period
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:11.76 Now you get promoted now you get a situation where you can fire that person that's a backstabber
00:59:12.72 --> 00:59:14.72 so
00:59:14.72 --> 00:59:18.16 You have to compromise your values as a personal little bit
00:59:18.16 --> 00:59:20.16 you
00:59:20.72 --> 00:59:27.20 And you know there's the enemy of my enemy is my friend right the enemy of my enemy is my friend
00:59:27.20 --> 00:59:30.16 So you might compromise your values short term
00:59:30.64 --> 00:59:36.72 Working somebody that you're not totally aligned with value wise and again if you're gonna get the long term
00:59:37.52 --> 00:59:40.16 Strategic goal well then
00:59:40.48 --> 00:59:45.28 Maybe it's worth it because you're gonna put you in a position where you can then hold your values
00:59:45.28 --> 00:59:49.68 Better if from a from a senior position or from a more powerful position
00:59:50.16 --> 00:59:53.36 So you might compromise them a little bit again. These are
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:56.80 Small compromise and you should have things of course. We got things that
00:59:57.36 --> 01:00:00.16 Values that you're you're never gonna compromise on
01:00:00.88 --> 01:00:02.08 Right
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:04.08 hitting a girl
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:05.28 Right
01:00:05.28 --> 01:00:08.80 You should you should never hit a girl right never hit a woman
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:11.28 Now
01:00:11.28 --> 01:00:13.28 That being said
01:00:13.28 --> 01:00:17.44 If there's a woman that's about to do something truly evil
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.04 You know
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:23.36 Kill a child or some kind of a terrorist act and the only thing you have that you can
01:00:24.32 --> 01:00:28.64 Stop it is to hit her. We'll guess what she's getting hit you know what I mean? So even then
01:00:29.36 --> 01:00:36.80 Your value of never hitting a girl can be compromised momentarily well you stop a a child from being murdered or whatever
01:00:36.96 --> 01:00:38.96 Yeah
01:00:38.96 --> 01:00:43.60 You know we as we we hold a value if we always want to tell the truth
01:00:46.24 --> 01:00:52.48 But if you had a for an extreme example if you had some kind of a state secret and and
01:00:53.20 --> 01:01:00.64 You got captured well of course you might lie about that and there's little I mean we could get into a whole like white lie
01:01:00.64 --> 01:01:07.60 Discussion on stuff like when your wife asks you how is the chicken and you want to tell her it's the most dry and
01:01:07.60 --> 01:01:09.60 And and
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.84 Charcoal tasting item that you've ever put in your mouth. That's not gonna help you long-term now
01:01:15.84 --> 01:01:20.80 So I might I might compromise my values of being truthful and tell her
01:01:22.08 --> 01:01:27.76 It's pretty good. Can I have some more ketchup over here? Can I get some more barbecue sauce on this?
01:01:28.32 --> 01:01:34.72 Chippon chicken and no and I'm gonna go grab some more water. Would you like some so I might compromise my values a little bit there
01:01:34.72 --> 01:01:36.72 Uh
01:01:37.12 --> 01:01:39.12 So I
01:01:39.12 --> 01:01:43.36 Guess what I'm saying is and people this is the thing people probably
01:01:44.48 --> 01:01:46.48 What they think of my persona
01:01:47.68 --> 01:01:52.96 Because people think oh I'm just gonna be this uncompromising never settle all out no slack
01:01:54.08 --> 01:01:56.72 Kind of person right that's when people want it want
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:01.76 You know want I guess want to see me has but the reality is
01:02:01.76 --> 01:02:03.76 Reason
01:02:04.72 --> 01:02:07.20 Right reason and thought
01:02:08.24 --> 01:02:12.80 Can can override values for the right reasons and
01:02:13.84 --> 01:02:15.84 That that's why we can think
01:02:16.68 --> 01:02:19.20 There's that's why we can think and there's there's actually times
01:02:19.84 --> 01:02:24.88 There's actually times when holding your values goes against your values
01:02:25.60 --> 01:02:29.12 So if you always backup your friends, right you always backup your friends
01:02:29.12 --> 01:02:33.60 But then your friend does something that's totally a moral and is against your values
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.16 Well then you can't backup you can't hold a value of backing up your friends because guess what they did something a moral
01:02:38.48 --> 01:02:43.52 They did something that was wrong and so if you held your values you'd be not holding your values
01:02:43.92 --> 01:02:45.28 That's the
01:02:45.28 --> 01:02:49.36 dichotomy there, right that's the dichotomy the and the additional dichotomy is
01:02:50.48 --> 01:02:54.80 You hold your values right you hold those basic principles that you believe in
01:02:54.80 --> 01:03:03.04 But at the same time you've got to apply logic and reason to them to make sure that they're supporting your long-term goal and your long-term values
01:03:03.76 --> 01:03:10.40 Because you don't want to you don't want to make a hard stand on something that costs you everything
01:03:10.40 --> 01:03:13.92 We're now in the future you can no longer manipulate any more situations
01:03:17.36 --> 01:03:21.36 That's one of the things that makes leadership and and life hard
01:03:22.32 --> 01:03:24.32 Is that it isn't blocking right
01:03:24.32 --> 01:03:27.52 It isn't black wind it's gray and so
01:03:28.40 --> 01:03:32.56 our decisions on these very things these are the challenges of leadership
01:03:34.64 --> 01:03:42.64 And there's there's no way right or wrong answer of of saying if it's right or wrong to violate your your values to achieve a goal
01:03:42.72 --> 01:03:47.12 That initial questions there's too many variables in that there's too many variables
01:03:47.36 --> 01:03:52.24 But start with this part that I started the whole answer with all line your values with your goal
01:03:52.24 --> 01:03:56.56 That's where you start and then you use reason
01:03:58.72 --> 01:04:06.16 Logic and thought to determine your actions based on the situation weight against your values you have to
01:04:07.44 --> 01:04:10.40 Think yeah, so
01:04:11.36 --> 01:04:15.36 Given what you're saying yes, it's so it's less like
01:04:15.36 --> 01:04:23.60 Just values like you have a dinner plate with here's my values kind of thing it's more of a hierarchy of values
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:30.08 So you will violate your values if it's on you know level two for a level four
01:04:30.64 --> 01:04:35.36 Yeah, I'll hit all not go right out if it's in the way of my
01:04:36.08 --> 01:04:40.32 Higher value which is protect your family protect my family kids, you know all this stuff
01:04:41.04 --> 01:04:42.72 Same thing girls don't mess
01:04:42.72 --> 01:04:48.24 They got their dope mess with that goes family yeah, please don't come and at you you know obviously same thing with you know
01:04:50.56 --> 01:04:54.88 Writing on your or backing up your friend. Yeah, you know my values backing up my friend that's level two
01:04:55.20 --> 01:04:56.48 You know the whole
01:04:56.48 --> 01:05:01.28 Your moral thing assaulting a girl. I don't know whatever the you know yeah that's level four
01:05:01.28 --> 01:05:06.48 So sorry number two, you know I'm going for number four kind of so it's like a hierarchy yeah. You got a little hierarchy values
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:08.48 There's some you know obviously there's some that
01:05:08.48 --> 01:05:15.68 I can't you know you you could give any of one of your highest values that you could come up with and you could
01:05:15.68 --> 01:05:21.20 Sit here and and theoretically come up with a situation where you would sacrifice that value yeah, and
01:05:21.20 --> 01:05:23.20 Right that's the way it is. Yeah
01:05:23.36 --> 01:05:28.40 So that's why we're humans we have the ability to think we have the ability reason and
01:05:29.20 --> 01:05:31.84 Sometimes you might have to compromise your values a little bit to
01:05:31.84 --> 01:05:38.88 To survive right yeah to survive and get so that you can long term
01:05:40.56 --> 01:05:43.60 Carry out your values to a higher degree yeah
01:05:44.64 --> 01:05:50.000 Yeah, like the um and the back to the people want to lose weight, you know
01:05:52.32 --> 01:05:54.32 If usually people who
01:05:55.60 --> 01:06:00.96 I don't know I guess I would imagine that usually people who take steroids their value isn't the health
01:06:00.96 --> 01:06:04.80 It's like because people typically unless it's a medical thing, you know, it's a good point
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:10.16 You know the stirrer's ain't for all it's for to win or to be cool. Yeah, which is kind of strange
01:06:10.16 --> 01:06:15.36 But you know it's usually to win a competition or something like this, but um, but nonetheless
01:06:15.36 --> 01:06:19.84 I think that whole trip giving away you said and I think it's kind of kind of coming together
01:06:19.84 --> 01:06:26.48 There I think that it is like a hierarchy of values. Yeah, yeah, and if someone's going to use steroids to cheat
01:06:26.48 --> 01:06:31.28 That's I mean even that we can do it's a whole another discussion
01:06:31.28 --> 01:06:34.08 Yeah, but what do they really prove in what are they really winning?
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:36.48 Right, yeah, and that goes back to remember
01:06:36.48 --> 01:06:41.84 I forget what we were talking about like some people like they want to they want to appear to win
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:46.08 You know, especially now you can see it on like online not you don't spend that much time at like the
01:06:46.08 --> 01:06:48.08 Dischruising Facebook, but you see
01:06:48.96 --> 01:06:50.96 You can see someone that you know
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:53.36 I don't know there there they're they're about to
01:06:53.36 --> 01:06:57.76 Murder each other husband and wife they hate each other. They don't even sleep in the same room
01:06:57.92 --> 01:07:02.56 But they went on vacation with their kids or whatever and they're like oh so in love in front of the fairs wheel
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:04.80 They're the waterfall or whatever and you're like, bro
01:07:05.36 --> 01:07:10.24 You just want people to think you win you just want to appear that you want you know
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:16.000 But it's not real that's why people cheat. Yeah. That's why like the guy that you just do thing when they're like okay
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.92 I'm gonna I'm gonna say this guy. I read my leg. I'm gonna tell all he's deep you. You can't do that
01:07:19.92 --> 01:07:24.64 But you know you cheated kind of thing he his goal wasn't to win it was just to get the metal
01:07:25.20 --> 01:07:30.84 So it's you know well his goal metal is down here, but he's just he doesn't have the proper values
01:07:30.84 --> 01:07:33.80 Actually or be the winner. He needs to check his values
01:07:34.16 --> 01:07:36.16 He needs to check his hierarchy of values
01:07:36.16 --> 01:07:40.76 So yeah, so he didn't want to actually win and wanted the metal to appear
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:43.44 that he want
01:07:44.08 --> 01:07:46.08 that's
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:51.76 Is there any way to recalibrate the flight or fight response?
01:07:52.40 --> 01:08:02.80 I get that X I get that excess in adrenaline. Oh, I get that excess in adrenaline that gives me the wobbly legs and the flight response
01:08:04.32 --> 01:08:07.04 How do I go about remapping my reaction?
01:08:07.84 --> 01:08:08.80 Well
01:08:08.80 --> 01:08:10.16 Absolutely
01:08:10.16 --> 01:08:14.88 And I'm not 100% sure what situations you're talking about but
01:08:16.56 --> 01:08:18.08 Any type of
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:20.56 Danger right gives you this flight or flight
01:08:21.28 --> 01:08:26.56 Response so train start to training you get to boxing mojtai wrestling
01:08:27.20 --> 01:08:28.24 Shooting
01:08:28.24 --> 01:08:34.80 Competing competing right you get you slow butterflies when you compete you get those butterflies and you and you get used to them
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.52 and so
01:08:37.52 --> 01:08:39.52 train
01:08:39.52 --> 01:08:44.88 And get used to seeing how that reaction what that adrenaline feels like and and also get used to
01:08:45.12 --> 01:08:50.80 Understanding what the superior action is right fight or flight because sometimes flight is the correct response
01:08:51.12 --> 01:08:53.20 Sometimes fight is the correct response
01:08:53.76 --> 01:09:02.72 But what you want to do is you want to be able to assess and dictate which response you're gonna give and not just do whatever your instinct tells you because sometimes your instinct might be wrong
01:09:03.84 --> 01:09:05.52 And so again, I don't know
01:09:05.52 --> 01:09:13.76 What your actually the situation where you're going into but whatever it is because people get the flight or flight response to
01:09:14.32 --> 01:09:17.12 To everyday things to like public speaking right?
01:09:18.16 --> 01:09:20.16 Rock climbing
01:09:20.40 --> 01:09:22.80 And that's why I say like do these things
01:09:25.12 --> 01:09:28.72 Train in them so public speaking rock climbing you know if you want to get get a rock
01:09:28.72 --> 01:09:32.96 Want to go to get over that fighter flight response when you get a go go rock climbing you'll use to it
01:09:32.96 --> 01:09:37.36 You scared a heights go start parachuting, you know you'll get used to it
01:09:37.68 --> 01:09:44.000 Your scared of the water get worked up and go through swimming and then game come scoop a certified just
01:09:44.40 --> 01:09:49.28 Well the things that you're not comfortable with get comfortable with being uncomfortable and
01:09:52.80 --> 01:09:56.32 While you're doing to while you're doing them pay attention
01:09:56.88 --> 01:10:01.04 You got to detach a little bit when these things are when you're training to touch a little bit
01:10:01.04 --> 01:10:03.04 and
01:10:03.44 --> 01:10:06.40 See what is going on your mindset see what
01:10:07.68 --> 01:10:14.32 Red flags that you can see what things will make you aware of the fact that your nerves are you're adrenaline and you're you feel in yourself
01:10:14.48 --> 01:10:19.20 Clench in your fist you know, okay, so I've touched my fist be aware of it so that you can change it so you can adjust it
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:26.48 And put your again put yourself into these scenarios and escalate them so they get harder and harder and harder
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:30.64 horse Norse Norse until you're until you start to get control these things
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:36.08 Great, I hear something weird. It's not weird. You're not gonna think to weird but
01:10:37.20 --> 01:10:40.24 What I used to get super nervous about
01:10:40.88 --> 01:10:42.64 Biter flight response
01:10:42.64 --> 01:10:50.000 Public speaking, yeah, but that's not worse than not this story. Not worse necessarily, but just a different thing is like confrontation
01:10:50.56 --> 01:10:52.56 You know like like hey
01:10:52.56 --> 01:10:58.32 Whether someone's confronting me or someone or I got to confront someone, you know
01:10:58.64 --> 01:11:05.76 It's like this barrier, you know, you know some people they'll just step back and forth that very they'll confront you and then go back to just be like
01:11:05.76 --> 01:11:08.08 All right, I'm gonna go back to work kind of thing or school whatever
01:11:08.88 --> 01:11:16.32 But I've always seen it when I was younger whatever as this barrier then it's like you don't cross until it's 100% go time
01:11:16.88 --> 01:11:21.44 So any time I'm close to the barriers like you get super nervous because like dang as you go time
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:27.28 Is this confrontation mean physical fighting or just in general physical in general anything like if
01:11:28.32 --> 01:11:31.84 Something happened with somebody who are working with and they
01:11:32.40 --> 01:11:38.64 Lost something and you had to go confront them on it. You that would make you get fight or fly anything. You know, we're just cruising, you know
01:11:39.44 --> 01:11:41.44 fully
01:11:41.68 --> 01:11:43.92 But and
01:11:43.92 --> 01:11:48.56 Let's say mean your crazy am say they're joking and I'm teasing you about something and then
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:52.64 You like didn't like something and then it got it went from like this to like
01:11:53.76 --> 01:11:59.04 You know I mean like you didn't like what I said or something like I didn't like that and it became this thing like okay
01:11:59.04 --> 01:12:05.28 Like that yeah, yeah for what he's in it's that it's the it can be cruising like me
01:12:06.24 --> 01:12:11.84 On good terms with someone once it goes bad it's like to me. I just looked at it as this
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:14.56 This huge barrier
01:12:14.56 --> 01:12:18.56 That so I I actually I
01:12:18.72 --> 01:12:23.28 Actually get something like that and for me what it is
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.36 Same thing but when as soon as I feel it you know what I do I go
01:12:30.16 --> 01:12:34.48 Like I go if I have it I just default because and
01:12:35.12 --> 01:12:39.20 Sometimes what bothers me sometimes you know you don't always have the opportunity like let's say I get an email
01:12:39.20 --> 01:12:45.68 Someone says hey I really like the way this happened in bubble block it'll bother me and especially a little bother me
01:12:45.68 --> 01:12:51.52 If someone will say hey when for instance this is the kind of thing that would bother me is someone says hey you did this
01:12:52.64 --> 01:12:56.48 It seemed like you know you were putting me down in front of all these people
01:12:56.48 --> 01:13:01.36 I would feel bad about it right and I'd be like it would drive and so the only way for me to get over it
01:13:01.60 --> 01:13:06.80 Is I want to talk to him and say hey man this is what I did. I'm gonna send out an email to everyone to make sure that they know that that was you know
01:13:06.80 --> 01:13:12.08 My it wasn't mine doing you know say that you did a great job or whatever just try and make it right
01:13:12.16 --> 01:13:16.56 But the only otherwise it just turns it burns me up and I have to confront it
01:13:16.56 --> 01:13:21.36 I the the thing that bothers me and I used to like I recognize this now when I was younger
01:13:21.36 --> 01:13:24.40 I might not recognize it. I would just sit there and I wouldn't know what to do
01:13:24.40 --> 01:13:29.52 But now I know the solution the solution is with something's bothering you you go and you address the problem
01:13:29.60 --> 01:13:33.84 You know like my my kids will do something and I'll be all angry about it
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:38.000 I just go oh what what you know what I need you is going to talk to him about it. Hey, what did you what are you doing?
01:13:38.40 --> 01:13:42.72 Why did you do this here's the impact it has on the family here's the impact it has on your life
01:13:43.20 --> 01:13:47.36 Here's some other opportunities that you might miss out now here's some things that you could do better
01:13:47.36 --> 01:13:50.64 But you know here's some corrective actions we could take whatever the worst thing
01:13:50.64 --> 01:13:52.24 I can do is just sit there and hold it inside
01:13:52.24 --> 01:13:58.000 No, not a good thing to do. Yeah, and and I knew that fully I mean that that is not a good thing to do
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.92 But it was just one of those things that that really induced that fight or flare like response and
01:14:04.56 --> 01:14:11.60 Stranging in what helped a lot even just in regular confrontation any it is a specific type of confrontation it's not the kind where
01:14:12.88 --> 01:14:16.80 You know how like you you say something that you leave and then you think back and wait did I
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:23.04 Insult him yeah, and then that bothers me, but that to me. I'll call you right now
01:14:23.04 --> 01:14:30.08 Okay, I said that's no problem the kind of it's only kind of stuff the over the only stuff that did it was stuff that
01:14:30.96 --> 01:14:36.32 To cross this line puts us on bad terms temporarily or permanently it puts us on like not good
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:38.72 Terms anyway, who's that kind of thing, but
01:14:39.28 --> 01:14:42.16 Nonetheless you know what totally helped was you did to
01:14:43.28 --> 01:14:51.84 Totally out where I still don't want it, but if I think that the competition has to go down for whatever reason
01:14:51.84 --> 01:15:00.16 It's just way easier to do yeah just slap bump roll. Let's do it. Yeah kind of a thing you know, but I mean you got to do a correct
01:15:00.16 --> 01:15:05.04 You don't you don't lose your temper or going and I'm gonna go in mad you just you can address the problem
01:15:05.20 --> 01:15:10.08 But the the key isn't about like okay, I'm good at you know
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:15.36 Bringing up and going through barriers in regards to confrontation. It's not that it's
01:15:15.36 --> 01:15:21.76 That barrier no longer produces that response so I can dance up to the barrier if it gets crossing gets crossed
01:15:22.08 --> 01:15:26.88 You know and it's like whatever. I remember about it. I know this makes you more comfortable crossing the barrier if need be
01:15:26.88 --> 01:15:29.76 Whatever. I do you get there. Yes, ideally
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:34.48 I'm not gonna try to cross the barriers for as being good terms bad terms. I'm not gonna try to go to bad terms any time
01:15:34.48 --> 01:15:36.16 You know be impolite or some amount of things
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:39.44 Not I mean that that's more depends on what kind of person you're I think I think
01:15:40.24 --> 01:15:45.12 But like I said the key for me or the the element the
01:15:45.12 --> 01:15:49.60 Critical element there was that barrier how I felt about being near it or crossing it or not crossing whatever
01:15:50.32 --> 01:15:54.56 Didn't cure it but it helps so much. I'll do okay. I won't make the story long, but
01:15:55.20 --> 01:15:59.76 That we we are all hoping to do this actually this is actually after I started it's but
01:16:00.80 --> 01:16:05.20 Just an example so I was doing video work for yes for this guy
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.64 And I say who it doesn't matter um and
01:16:10.64 --> 01:16:16.32 He had found out that I was doing other video work. I don't know maybe at a sense of like owner
01:16:16.32 --> 01:16:21.68 I don't know he knew that or he found out or knew that I was doing video for not a competitive thing or nothing like that
01:16:21.68 --> 01:16:27.12 But just other video work kind of like hey wait you're not spinning all your time on my stuff kind of thing
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:31.60 That's what I got the sense of but nonetheless and I had to do a travel you know
01:16:31.60 --> 01:16:36.72 So it's traveling here and I'm like hey I gotta go because I have to travel now to this other place and it's kind of like that's where I felt it
01:16:37.44 --> 01:16:38.64 nonetheless
01:16:38.64 --> 01:16:40.64 so
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:47.12 The video wasn't due to like the certain date and then I was like yeah my prediction I should have it by this date
01:16:47.12 --> 01:16:50.96 Which was way ahead of the date by the way and then that day I didn't have it
01:16:51.60 --> 01:16:54.56 And I was like oh you know I didn't think it was gonna be a big deal because
01:16:55.28 --> 01:17:01.04 It just didn't seem like a big deal you're predicted date didn't get there. It wasn't the due date right not even based okay
01:17:01.04 --> 01:17:05.20 Yeah, and then so I was like oh, I don't have it, you know
01:17:05.20 --> 01:17:09.52 You know I've been working on it, but you know, I don't have it maybe tomorrow like something like that
01:17:09.52 --> 01:17:14.24 Like I like it maybe like one hour. I'll have it free wasn't an hour, but it was like all have it
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:16.96 You see and and he was like I
01:17:17.52 --> 01:17:22.08 Thought given kind of our history whatever I thought he was gonna go. Okay. Well cool tomorrow
01:17:22.08 --> 01:17:25.20 Let's we'll see tomorrow makes I just see a kind of a thing that's what I was expecting
01:17:25.84 --> 01:17:27.12 But he was like
01:17:27.12 --> 01:17:29.12 He was like okay tomorrow
01:17:29.12 --> 01:17:34.24 You know I'm really disappointed that you don't have it for me right now and
01:17:34.24 --> 01:17:40.72 I was really expecting to have that to see something and I'm really disappointed that you don't have anything for me right now
01:17:40.72 --> 01:17:42.72 And I was like
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:45.36 Boom heart just beating this on the phone too by the way
01:17:45.36 --> 01:17:48.56 Things not like oh, I was you know, come front it and you know anything
01:17:48.88 --> 01:17:53.44 It was just that and brought to the point where I didn't even know what to say so what did you say?
01:17:53.84 --> 01:17:56.000 I was like I don't even know what I said
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.64 I think it was just kind of like I didn't say anything and it was like
01:17:58.64 --> 01:18:05.76 So is that maybe one of the one of the things that's caused you to really hold back on making a bunch of videos for John
01:18:09.20 --> 01:18:13.52 Because there's a bunch of us that want to make that phone call to you well if that were disappointed
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:18.10 Just you know we that listen to this podcast where disappointed if that were the case
01:18:18.10 --> 01:18:22.000 Would not be making would would not be making videos every single day if that were the case?
01:18:22.48 --> 01:18:26.72 Well, I wish we'll we do differently over here on our end anyway
01:18:26.72 --> 01:18:32.64 That was an ex that's an example just like out because really when I think about it back like that's not a big confrontation
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.80 Probably had a lot to do with X through too anyway, but yeah, you
01:18:37.36 --> 01:18:39.36 For some reason though generally speaking
01:18:40.24 --> 01:18:42.24 that you just to help
01:18:42.88 --> 01:18:45.84 It's only have is you have genuine intentions. I think
01:18:46.40 --> 01:18:48.40 Hey that conversation's gonna come
01:18:49.12 --> 01:18:51.12 Cool
01:18:51.12 --> 01:18:53.12 Next question
01:18:53.12 --> 01:18:58.64 The serious question is about question indirect approach
01:19:00.16 --> 01:19:04.96 I have a history of starting things and then giving up on them when I get bored
01:19:05.52 --> 01:19:07.52 I'm the same way by the way or anyway
01:19:11.52 --> 01:19:16.32 A friend of mine is the same I'm working on it by sticking with one thing
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:19.52 Making a website which will be done in two weeks
01:19:19.52 --> 01:19:25.52 I call my friend once a month and he always tells me about some new hair brand idea that he never acts on
01:19:26.16 --> 01:19:28.64 I've tried suggesting that he picked one thing and
01:19:29.52 --> 01:19:36.64 Stick with it, but he immediately shuts down how can I take the indirect approach and get him to actually follow through on things?
01:19:37.52 --> 01:19:44.56 Okay, so you're trying to help your friend prioritize next Q which is really good to go your friend sounds like he needs to prioritize next Q and
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:49.20 Get some follow through going on with that as well. I would say this you want to do a little indirect there
01:19:49.60 --> 01:19:54.32 What I might do with him is get involved in a project with him like pick one of those when he calls up with a little
01:19:54.32 --> 01:19:59.12 He's hair brand ideas and you think it's a decent one say okay cool. Let's rock and roll with that. I want to get in the game
01:20:00.80 --> 01:20:02.32 And then
01:20:02.32 --> 01:20:08.48 Lay out some deadlines. Okay, this what we need to get down by here. This what we need to be done by this point. I'll do these four items
01:20:08.48 --> 01:20:16.32 You do these four items and that's what we'll get going here's the due date that we'll get him done by so we can make this launch boom, right?
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:25.92 And then you deliver your end you deliver your end and then when he doesn't now you can have a better discussion that's not so
01:20:27.52 --> 01:20:30.32 Aggressive you have a reason for it, you know, and then
01:20:31.92 --> 01:20:36.96 You know, maybe even subtly tell him that you're hey can I I'm gonna go ahead and go proceed further with your idea
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:38.96 Like I'm you're not gonna do it
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:44.88 So I'm gonna do it. You just became my idea right and then because you're not gonna execute because he needs to understand
01:20:46.08 --> 01:20:47.36 that
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:48.96 Idea people
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:54.40 That's great glad you have a lot of great ideas, but it doesn't help doesn't get anything done and ideas without executions
01:20:55.36 --> 01:21:01.92 Ideas without execution the ideas themselves literally do not exist your idea is worthless
01:21:02.16 --> 01:21:04.16 It's totally worthless
01:21:04.16 --> 01:21:07.20 if you don't execute on it so
01:21:09.36 --> 01:21:14.72 You have to execute any the execution of ideas into life
01:21:15.52 --> 01:21:21.28 Right, we that's what it is when you when you execute an idea it's creation
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:30.24 It's not dreaming it's not thinking it's doing you are creating something and that's awesome like just creation
01:21:30.24 --> 01:21:39.76 is is an awesome thing to be a part of and it's an awesome thing to lead and to take an idea and turn it into something that's real and create
01:21:40.48 --> 01:21:42.48 and deliver it that's
01:21:43.28 --> 01:21:49.84 That's just a hugely rewarding thing in life and he obviously probably hasn't experienced that many times
01:21:50.56 --> 01:21:54.88 And so how can you let him know that let him know that
01:21:54.88 --> 01:22:00.64 that you know ideas mean nothing without executions and our goal is to create something and again
01:22:00.64 --> 01:22:08.56 I think the best way to do this to join forces with him and drag him along so he can get that feeling of the satisfaction of how good it feels to make something happen
01:22:11.68 --> 01:22:13.28 Now
01:22:13.28 --> 01:22:14.32 the bad news is
01:22:16.32 --> 01:22:21.28 If he doesn't like like if he doesn't do his things he doesn't do his part you can coach him you can
01:22:21.28 --> 01:22:25.84 You can do what you can to help him but
01:22:27.20 --> 01:22:29.12 Eventually you gotta go out make things happen on your own
01:22:29.12 --> 01:22:36.08 I mean that's just what you gotta do and you can't it's very hard I can't seem like I say you can't but it's very very difficult to help people
01:22:36.88 --> 01:22:41.44 That don't want to be helped that don't recognize their errors that are their eagles too
01:22:41.44 --> 01:22:45.68 Because a lot of people that are idea people they'll literally tell you that you know look what I mean
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:48.96 I'm an idea guys
01:22:48.96 --> 01:22:53.68 And and you know you say okay cool. I'm gonna go over here and actually make things happen so bye bye
01:22:53.92 --> 01:22:59.36 Your ideas so if it's someone that's arrogant like that because that's that's a level of arrogance right?
01:22:59.36 --> 01:23:04.80 Hey look I don't do this little labor stuff. I'm not a guy about execution. What I do is I have ideas
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:10.08 A brilliance that's what I do over here. That's those people are not gonna help you
01:23:10.88 --> 01:23:13.68 So eventually you do what you can to help them out
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.72 You try and get them involved in some of your projects help hopefully you can get them all the way through a project
01:23:18.72 --> 01:23:24.56 Where he can see the and feel the gratification of success and execution and creation
01:23:25.04 --> 01:23:27.04 But if he never takes that blood
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000 He's he's gonna be a vegetarian
01:23:30.72 --> 01:23:35.60 So it's gonna go down he's gonna be a salad eater and and that's not good
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:40.32 Nothing going with eating salads by the way. No, are you salads with steak all of
01:23:40.32 --> 01:23:48.88 That's like Brad that's so true so my brother we know Jay he does apps like
01:23:49.68 --> 01:23:52.32 Obviously you know his company they do apps so
01:23:53.04 --> 01:23:56.72 Apps let's say I'm just saying in general now apps website
01:23:57.28 --> 01:23:59.04 Video in my case so
01:23:59.04 --> 01:24:02.72 These are things is other the other industries and skills whatever
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:07.20 But these are the things that attract the idea of people hey I got an idea for a video
01:24:07.20 --> 01:24:10.56 I got an idea for an app I got an idea for a website. I got an idea
01:24:10.88 --> 01:24:15.60 So we mean my brother we attract these people right so
01:24:16.96 --> 01:24:22.72 It's like when you encounter that it's kind of like me saying it I have an idea for the cure for cancer
01:24:22.72 --> 01:24:28.88 So what it does is it goes in and it targets just the cancer cells and it leaves all the other cells alone
01:24:29.52 --> 01:24:32.16 All of them just leaves them alone just just kills the cancer cells
01:24:32.40 --> 01:24:36.80 So let's say in like I don't know hundred years that happens right now I'm like that was man
01:24:36.80 --> 01:24:41.84 Yeah, but no it wasn't wasn't it was an idea the ideas me not just like I said it's so it gets and
01:24:43.44 --> 01:24:46.88 To say it gets annoying. I mean that's kind of maybe not the most accurate way it
01:24:47.92 --> 01:24:54.24 For lack of entertainment it's real interesting that it's not that clear to people you know when if you're because
01:24:54.48 --> 01:24:56.80 Execution is everything idea that I think
01:24:57.20 --> 01:25:02.000 Might have been too embarrassed some some of the same ideas worth like super like super small amount
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.52 All the even go further and say it's literally worth nothing just like you just like I said I guess there's some granularity of of
01:25:10.64 --> 01:25:12.64 It you know what's weird
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:17.28 It's it's a dichotomy because the idea is the worthless and at the same time
01:25:17.28 --> 01:25:23.52 It's the most valuable thing but it only gets value if it gets executed on otherwise it has zero value
01:25:23.92 --> 01:25:30.24 Yeah, and to the execution part execution it because here's what you get to and I actually in a way was kind of one of these people
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:32.24 Or I do like I have how these cool ideas
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:36.64 So the first thing I'm gonna do when I get this idea. I'm gonna go buy the domain name
01:25:37.28 --> 01:25:40.80 Right, I'm gonna you know sell this you know whatever
01:25:40.80 --> 01:25:45.52 I'm by the domain name because I'm doing I'm executing boom step one so that that's what this guy's doing
01:25:45.52 --> 01:25:50.40 Yeah, you know this guy who has these ideas and some of the ladies or some form of this
01:25:50.40 --> 01:25:52.40 Don't name he's habitual
01:25:52.40 --> 01:25:54.40 Don't name me
01:25:55.04 --> 01:25:56.40 He might you know
01:25:56.40 --> 01:26:01.68 He might see if the trademark or the whatever is you know taken and all this stuff in the register and you know
01:26:01.68 --> 01:26:05.04 When once the work starts you were like oh, well, I'm kind of bored
01:26:05.68 --> 01:26:07.68 Right, so the thing bored of that and
01:26:08.40 --> 01:26:12.40 Mean while like that's usually the fun part you know the excitement
01:26:12.40 --> 01:26:18.72 Ooh, I see all the potential you know all this stuff, but when the reality starts hitting and you know the hills get steeper and so like
01:26:18.72 --> 01:26:22.40 Oh, the hard work. Yeah, that actual part of any idea
01:26:22.40 --> 01:26:27.36 The materialized. Yeah, when that comes to view or comes into you know interplay
01:26:27.76 --> 01:26:30.32 That's when they quote unquote get bored. Yeah, and
01:26:31.92 --> 01:26:35.84 When you take one maybe two steps back this it's really clear because
01:26:37.76 --> 01:26:44.08 You you consider the the percentage of people doesn't life where a successful in like their dream thing
01:26:44.64 --> 01:26:48.72 I'm a computer programmer and now I own a computer programming biz
01:26:48.72 --> 01:26:56.64 I don't know that's my example the amount of people who have that actually happening are really few and furthermore
01:26:58.24 --> 01:27:00.24 You ask any one of those people
01:27:00.80 --> 01:27:04.40 It was never like I had the idea about the domain name three weeks later
01:27:04.80 --> 01:27:11.84 We were moving. It's never that it's like oh my gosh flop on my face fail years decades a lot of the time
01:27:12.08 --> 01:27:16.96 You know it's a grind grind. Yeah, and that's all that execution right there
01:27:16.96 --> 01:27:24.24 Executing is hard one time I still contact lenses. You know the colored contact lenses so totally
01:27:24.24 --> 01:27:26.24 Li-goshin it done it
01:27:27.44 --> 01:27:29.44 I imported them from
01:27:29.44 --> 01:27:32.16 I didn't import them but I bought them from a website
01:27:32.16 --> 01:27:34.16 Are we going back to the values conversation?
01:27:34.16 --> 01:27:39.20 Kind of putting people's eyesight at risk so you can make a dollar well they weren't prescription. They're all good
01:27:39.20 --> 01:27:44.56 You can buy them is just like but nonetheless I bought them and they'd they'd only take like five days to get here
01:27:44.56 --> 01:27:48.72 So I I knew how to make websites. I knew how to do all that stuff so I just made a website
01:27:48.72 --> 01:27:52.64 Color contact lenses, you know, and I knew about SEO and stuff like it's like just made the website
01:27:53.28 --> 01:27:58.96 You know eight bucks a month or something or a year for the domain website was free because Jade had the platform
01:27:58.96 --> 01:28:00.96 You could make websites
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:02.16 So it's all the bunch of contacts
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:06.64 Um, Halloween time comes around perfect SEO color contacts and Diego
01:28:07.44 --> 01:28:12.40 Buy them for me people would buy them like all you buy one and then buy it just buy it from the website comes in I just send them to
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:16.40 Execution oh, so you you're proud of this
01:28:17.44 --> 01:28:24.16 I'm not proud of selling contact. I'm proud of the execution part good job and then it started got bored. I bored with it so
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:30.16 All right next question. Yeah, let's go to the next question
01:28:30.96 --> 01:28:32.96 Oh, or this one
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:40.48 Jockel I was wondering what your opinion was on when to start a child in jujitsu
01:28:40.48 --> 01:28:47.52 My daughter was in the game at age seven and I'm on the mats as well my son is three and a half
01:28:48.48 --> 01:28:53.84 And it has expressed that he's very ready to start as well my concern is starting him too young
01:28:54.72 --> 01:29:00.08 Him getting crushed and falling out of love with jujitsu before he has a chance to fall in love with it
01:29:00.08 --> 01:29:02.08 This is the romance
01:29:04.88 --> 01:29:06.88 Okay, so
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:09.36 completely dependent on the maturity to get yeah and
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:13.36 I've said how old was your daughter when she started training
01:29:14.16 --> 01:29:22.80 Two two I'll tell you about the circumstances no two two straight up too. She's less than two and a half she's really mature
01:29:23.76 --> 01:29:28.40 Really smart and athletic and durable so
01:29:29.12 --> 01:29:34.08 That's that's like as young as you're gonna get yeah and and what
01:29:34.08 --> 01:29:40.80 What how many times a week would you go to and was there other small children in the class?
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:45.12 Yes, you had some kind of a right you knew somebody that was also bringing their kid in or something like that
01:29:45.12 --> 01:29:51.04 Yeah, a good play made in there. Well, it needs to make it's kind of a long all all I'll tell you about it for sure
01:29:53.20 --> 01:29:55.20 Basically it's
01:29:55.20 --> 01:30:00.08 You don't mat backer and them it's a it's Gracie certified training center up in the way
01:30:00.08 --> 01:30:02.88 Yeah, it's a smaller gym, but so
01:30:02.88 --> 01:30:06.48 You know they have programs for younger kids or whatever and
01:30:07.76 --> 01:30:09.36 It's essentially like you you
01:30:10.24 --> 01:30:15.04 Modify the young kids for which is like four four makes it's playing that's what it is
01:30:15.20 --> 01:30:20.64 But here's the thing you learn you get some tips and and in there you'll say you'll teach them that this is
01:30:20.64 --> 01:30:25.04 You do they don't know that you're they're they're gonna tap on them. They're a person down
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:28.000 They don't know that it's a mount it's a they're thinking they're gonna try to get out of the mount
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.28 Yeah, you just think they're just trying to get off the bottom. Yeah, and they they have games where you balance on stuff and it works on their balance
01:30:33.28 --> 01:30:36.16 And you know the myths that you hit you know
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:39.44 They line them up and you get to it's like oh walking on the pot
01:30:39.44 --> 01:30:44.48 So they play all these games, but it's crazy how like it's just it's like karate kid men
01:30:44.48 --> 01:30:49.84 You know, you know, I'm gonna get a lot of snacks on wax off and they get good at the wax on wax off because it's kind of fun
01:30:49.84 --> 01:30:54.32 Well wax on wax on stuff fun, but the stuff you do in there is fun and then when they're like okay
01:30:54.32 --> 01:30:59.92 Who and it's really you you gotta find the right person man the right teacher because man Madby he was like
01:31:00.32 --> 01:31:02.96 He's so gentle kids are right because there's other
01:31:03.76 --> 01:31:06.08 Young kids and they're they're running around you know
01:31:06.08 --> 01:31:12.64 They're not he knows he knows not everyone's gonna be paying attention. You know you got to and so they got to know how to
01:31:13.12 --> 01:31:20.72 Deal with kids, but I mean she took it and he was good. Yeah, and there's some kids that are 11 and 12 years old that aren't ready for
01:31:20.72 --> 01:31:25.44 Yeah, they're just not there yet and I would also say
01:31:26.40 --> 01:31:32.40 Less is more for a young kid, you know, you don't want to just burn them out don't smoke them on that everyday make them look forward
01:31:32.72 --> 01:31:36.72 Pull them off the mat. They want to stay a little longer. Hey, we got to go. I mean you want to let them have some fun, but
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000 I burned my kids out
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.84 I backed off in time for my son because he was younger and I didn't you know because my my daughter's I was like
01:31:47.84 --> 01:31:54.48 Compete train compete train compete. Oh, I'm gonna put you in the heavier weight class the older kids bracket
01:31:54.48 --> 01:31:57.68 I mean I just did it wrong right just did it wrong and
01:31:59.36 --> 01:32:03.12 I didn't back off in time and so now they trained you know, I mean
01:32:04.08 --> 01:32:06.96 Not as much as they should right my son trains all the time
01:32:08.48 --> 01:32:12.96 But I did a bad job of making to just you fun right because that's and that's what you know
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:16.72 That's why I like you the fact that this question he said and I started me too young
01:32:16.72 --> 01:32:21.92 He's gonna get crushed. Hey, you shouldn't you know Jim that you take your three and a half year old child too
01:32:22.08 --> 01:32:29.92 Should be allowing him to get crushed. Yeah, that shouldn't be happening. So if you have a good Jim we got the right instructor
01:32:32.48 --> 01:32:37.68 That then go and let them have fun and make sure it just stays fun and and if they don't love it
01:32:37.68 --> 01:32:42.80 You can't make them love it. It's not gonna happen now. This is a good story one of my son's friends
01:32:42.80 --> 01:32:49.92 Who I always want all everyone to train to get through obviously with this guy's a friend of mine known for a long time
01:32:49.92 --> 01:32:55.12 It has a son that's my son's age and so they kind of grown up together and you know my son's always trained in
01:32:55.12 --> 01:32:59.52 Judit's who and I would say hey, you know when they were six years old hey have you son come in and try it
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:01.92 came in and try to one day hate
01:33:03.04 --> 01:33:07.20 Year later now, you know a year or something like that 13 months 18 much or something
01:33:07.84 --> 01:33:11.12 Comes in a year later try as again. He's like now seven years old
01:33:11.12 --> 01:33:14.48 Hey, it just doesn't like it can't stand it
01:33:15.84 --> 01:33:20.48 Then comes in at you know nine years old comes in
01:33:21.20 --> 01:33:22.40 Loves it
01:33:22.40 --> 01:33:28.56 Trainings every day now. You know me trains all the time and and you know now he's my and and I'll tell you what this is what's cool
01:33:29.84 --> 01:33:31.84 is that
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:33.44 he's
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:36.40 It's not like he's a million years
01:33:36.40 --> 01:33:43.68 It's not so so my son trained three years more or maybe even four years more than than this other kid my son
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:50.16 Is that kid caught up right? I mean he's my son still a little bit a little bit better, but
01:33:50.72 --> 01:33:53.60 They're in the same game right there. It's not like it's not like
01:33:54.32 --> 01:34:01.52 That my son has this massive lead no the kid loves it and you can learn you can learn and get better
01:34:02.88 --> 01:34:04.16 You know at any age
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:08.72 But my point and saying that is forcing him to be in it for those three years
01:34:09.60 --> 01:34:12.08 Would not have helped he would have he would have quit
01:34:12.08 --> 01:34:16.64 Judged it to completely but just having a show in a tune and saying hey, this is what you do and you know
01:34:16.64 --> 01:34:19.52 He didn't like getting choked right that's and and
01:34:20.32 --> 01:34:25.28 Maybe that's me and my buddy son so hey, let's let's get after a little bit and we won't let him get chokes
01:34:25.28 --> 01:34:29.20 But he just didn't like the claustrophobia of it right and there is claustrophobia
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:33.28 You're gonna feel at even in an even in a gentle situation with a six-year-old if you're
01:34:33.28 --> 01:34:38.80 It held down you know like it. You know you didn't like it. Yeah now he's holding people down himself so
01:34:40.48 --> 01:34:41.76 You you
01:34:41.76 --> 01:34:46.64 Basically what I'm saying is forcing someone to kid to do something for two years
01:34:47.20 --> 01:34:51.20 You think you're getting this value two years worth of value you're not getting two years worth of value
01:34:51.20 --> 01:34:56.96 You're actually going in the other direction so you might as well just let him try to occasionally and I say that sometimes
01:34:56.96 --> 01:35:02.40 Kids look at my gym now. Hey, you know my son just doesn't want to do it right now and I go no problem
01:35:02.40 --> 01:35:06.16 Hey, you know what I say they say I do want to make him come like I don't make him come
01:35:06.72 --> 01:35:11.60 I go don't make him come let him come when he wants to you know you're gonna stop your membership
01:35:11.60 --> 01:35:16.32 That's cool if you want to come in on Saturdays bring him in you know you want to come in once a you know once a month
01:35:16.72 --> 01:35:24.000 To just keep him familiar do that and just do that you don't grind their brains out when there
01:35:25.36 --> 01:35:29.20 Whatever little kids even big kids. I think hey
01:35:29.20 --> 01:35:35.12 You know how you say like you just you should be fun so the
01:35:37.68 --> 01:35:43.44 If okay, so like okay you're watching a Bronx tail you're both that okay, so there's a part on that where
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.24 We're you know these biker guys there in the bar
01:35:46.64 --> 01:35:51.28 You know causing trouble. I can't get out exactly right. So that's what it is and this is what this guy got to be care
01:35:51.28 --> 01:35:57.04 Okay, so for those never seen Bronx tail these biker guys are in the bar and they're like causing trouble and all this stuff
01:35:57.04 --> 01:36:01.68 And and then the people there hey you guys please the mobsters the mobsters say hey guys
01:36:01.68 --> 01:36:05.04 Please leave you need to get out of here. Yeah, like I would do it every one needs it now
01:36:05.04 --> 01:36:06.88 No, no, no, they're like hey, okay. We'll leave
01:36:07.60 --> 01:36:10.04 Let me get one beer in the guys. Okay, one more beer
01:36:10.04 --> 01:36:14.16 They grab the beer in the shape to be all over them now. This stuff. So anyway, they locked the doors
01:36:14.16 --> 01:36:18.16 I say we ask you to leave now you can't leave right bad situation for the biker
01:36:18.16 --> 01:36:19.20 So
01:36:19.52 --> 01:36:24.48 This is what in my opinion this guy has to avoid like if his son three and a half is like dang
01:36:24.48 --> 01:36:28.40 I'm showing interest. I want to get kind of get get on the mat on a jump in here. I see what's going on
01:36:28.40 --> 01:36:30.56 It looks like fun on the jump in don't be like hey
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:37.04 You want to get in now you can't leave don't do that kind of stuff. Do you leave the door open right? Yes
01:36:37.20 --> 01:36:45.04 Exactly so as you know presses three and a half now where two and a mat becks for a while and learned it and it was cool and
01:36:46.48 --> 01:36:49.84 Now I just bring her with me just once a week when I gone Fridays or whatever

01:37:45.04 --> 01:37:49.52 When you know my mom comes and visit she's like hey, let me show grandma mount and she wants to do it, you know
01:37:49.52 --> 01:37:53.92 You and yeah, so that'll keep her in the game and when she starts getting a lot more ability
01:37:53.92 --> 01:38:00.80 You know age like three and a half now so like let's take four five six seven. Yeah, she's gonna start to realize all shoot
01:38:00.80 --> 01:38:06.40 I can do this stuff now, you know because all these little things that I learned just by playing around really
01:38:07.04 --> 01:38:08.80 And that's kind of what you want with that
01:38:08.80 --> 01:38:13.52 But if it's if they look at it this thing now my dad forced me to do it so hard and claustrophobic
01:38:13.52 --> 01:38:19.28 Yeah, guys sweating on me and I'm losing the whole time because they just started and I'm rolling with Thor the whole time and
01:38:19.68 --> 01:38:21.20 He's you know
01:38:21.20 --> 01:38:26.32 Kittling me or whatever and that's my experience my whole regard for the jitz is gonna be like yeah
01:38:26.64 --> 01:38:33.20 You know this isn't there's also a little bit of rebellion and all in most children in like my one of my daughters
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:37.44 She doesn't want to change jitz or but she wrestles in high school
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:44.56 Hmm so that's awesome, but she almost does that just to be you know, I wrestle
01:38:45.76 --> 01:38:50.000 Little does she know she got flanked she got flanked
01:38:55.12 --> 01:38:57.12 I think so I mean
01:38:57.68 --> 01:38:59.68 Back to the question I think that
01:38:59.68 --> 01:39:08.40 There given a certain type of teacher which I mean the demands on a teacher for a you know a young
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:15.28 Yeah, it's so hard so you got a it's rare to find a teacher especially if you have a teacher who doesn't like
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:19.68 Do that you know if it's like okay, I'm gonna make an exception for this because I seen guys
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:24.72 They're comfortable their friends with the gym kind of thing and they're like yeah my kids too, but we all like each other right
01:39:24.72 --> 01:39:30.48 Hey jump in the kids class he's too he's running around he's interrupted in the class like yeah, it's not it's not good
01:39:30.48 --> 01:39:33.52 If the kids not ready in the teacher that that's not a compatible
01:39:33.52 --> 01:39:38.24 Allegiance right up if kids not ready will say hey your kids not ready. Yeah. Yeah, you can't you can't be in here
01:39:38.24 --> 01:39:42.40 Yeah come back in six months. You want to bring him a watch on Saturdays cool
01:39:42.96 --> 01:39:49.44 Get familiar with you. You bring him into watch. It's a time we're going you know all a hopefully is not disrupted
01:39:49.84 --> 01:39:53.60 Hopefully well they can't be disrupted where they can't stay right right. Hey you can't do that
01:39:53.60 --> 01:40:01.68 Yeah, oh yeah, so in that case, you know it's not gonna work, but yeah, that's it just like how you said just but in the door
01:40:01.68 --> 01:40:05.92 I'm cruising in here. It looks like the door is open. I'm cruising here. I'm doing one stuff
01:40:06.24 --> 01:40:11.04 Come on in I'm not gonna close the door. I'm not gonna go uh Bronx tail on you. You know
01:40:11.76 --> 01:40:13.76 That's how you do it my opinion
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:18.72 Check all right. All right. We got time for the work. Oh, yeah, okay
01:40:18.72 --> 01:40:29.20 Jockel have you most okay Jockel I have mostly lived a life dominated by doubt and fear
01:40:30.56 --> 01:40:33.44 What are your thoughts on how I can step into bravery?
01:40:35.12 --> 01:40:42.32 You know, I actually took this question from Twitter and I answered the question in one word
01:40:42.32 --> 01:40:51.52 You've lived a life dominated by doubt and fear how do you step into bravery?
01:40:56.16 --> 01:40:58.16 Step
01:40:59.44 --> 01:41:04.000 That's how you step into bravery step take the step
01:41:05.84 --> 01:41:07.84 Step aggressively
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:11.84 towards your fear and that
01:41:13.04 --> 01:41:17.20 That step towards your fear is the step into bravery
01:41:19.76 --> 01:41:23.84 Because we we're scared of what we don't know
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000 and
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000 there's only one way
01:41:31.36 --> 01:41:37.60 to learn and to know and that is to confront that fear you have to step
01:41:37.60 --> 01:41:40.64 You have to go and this simple action
01:41:41.84 --> 01:41:43.84 This simple attitude
01:41:45.68 --> 01:41:48.88 It answers so many questions
01:41:51.04 --> 01:41:53.04 so many questions how
01:41:54.40 --> 01:41:57.44 How do you get to the gym every day?
01:41:59.68 --> 01:42:03.28 You step you go how do you how do you change your diet?
01:42:03.28 --> 01:42:13.76 You step you go how do you overcome fear of failure fear of success or or fear of fear itself?
01:42:16.88 --> 01:42:18.48 You step
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.92 Then how do you face the fear of the unknown when you're step?
01:42:23.92 --> 01:42:29.28 Don't wait anymore don't think anymore don't plan anymore don't contemplate anymore
01:42:29.28 --> 01:42:33.84 Don't make any more excuses or justifications
01:42:35.36 --> 01:42:41.28 Don't rationalize anything else no no and no
01:42:44.72 --> 01:42:53.60 Instead be aggressive take action now and what is the first action that you need to take?
01:42:53.60 --> 01:42:57.92 What's the first step you need to take?
01:43:01.44 --> 01:43:05.44 The first step you need to take is just that
01:43:08.72 --> 01:43:10.72 Step
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:16.96 And I think that's
01:43:16.96 --> 01:43:21.60 All I've got for tonight so
01:43:23.44 --> 01:43:24.80 Speaking of stepping
01:43:27.28 --> 01:43:34.40 Echo Charles if somebody wanted to step up and support this podcast
01:43:35.12 --> 01:43:41.20 What would be a good step in making that happen before going to that?
01:43:42.24 --> 01:43:43.84 Good day
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:46.16 Where your bars came in?
01:43:47.44 --> 01:43:51.68 I mentioned I tried to jalapeno on anyway came in today
01:43:52.56 --> 01:43:53.20 Not standing
01:43:54.16 --> 01:43:54.56 I've been
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.28 You know this I've been kind of kind of off had the stomach flu
01:44:00.24 --> 01:44:06.000 To MRIs on my knee to see what up two knees you know so I kind of been out of the game two weeks out of the game
01:44:06.56 --> 01:44:08.24 Today was my first day back in the game
01:44:08.24 --> 01:44:14.56 First day back in the game did a Macon lifted some weights didn't do the jujuts yet
01:44:15.20 --> 01:44:16.72 but
01:44:16.72 --> 01:44:26.000 Yeah fully functional all good life that's meaning again then the warrior bars coming good day for Echo Charles great day
01:44:27.44 --> 01:44:29.20 Warrior bars on it warrior bars
01:44:29.60 --> 01:44:31.20 Let me talk about this before so
01:44:32.08 --> 01:44:36.08 Back to supporting the podcast thing and I know you're like what does that have to do with supporting the podcast so
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:38.08 On it warrior bars on it is
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:41.36 Supplements I remember back in the day
01:44:44.40 --> 01:44:49.04 When I first not first but made few years into lifting you know how people they'll just get supplements
01:44:50.08 --> 01:44:53.12 Joe we're super weight gain 2000 exactly
01:44:53.84 --> 01:44:57.20 Weight gain 2000 you know all the beta gen phosphogen yeah
01:44:57.20 --> 01:45:06.32 Uh, great a team you know you know apparently creatinians good anyway, I I feel I found that like supplements no supplements no factor
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:10.56 Doesn't even make a difference like when I was on supplements like weight gainer
01:45:10.56 --> 01:45:14.16 I ain't gain a bunch of weight no more than I would without the supplement anyway
01:45:14.72 --> 01:45:18.80 The point there is supplements are whack in my opinion
01:45:19.68 --> 01:45:25.12 And what I found out that you focus on the wrong thing on this for supplementation goes
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:27.12 It's gonna be wax so
01:45:27.52 --> 01:45:29.52 On on it.com
01:45:30.80 --> 01:45:34.32 Slash jacco slash jacco that's for the 10% off, but I'm gonna get to that
01:45:36.80 --> 01:45:42.80 Don't worry this has to do a supporting the podcast so so on it they have the correct supplements and not only the correct supplements
01:45:42.80 --> 01:45:46.24 The good quality because supplements don't have to be anything
01:45:46.24 --> 01:45:48.24 They don't have to be you have chopped pills
01:45:48.24 --> 01:45:52.80 I mean, you're either increase your mood not enough. Whatever increase them you're weight gain whatever
01:45:52.80 --> 01:45:54.80 All right
01:45:54.80 --> 01:46:00.56 But these are like legit and one of the few anyway, and okay, so if you want to supplement something don't get like weight gainers
01:46:01.12 --> 01:46:02.32 You know
01:46:02.32 --> 01:46:06.40 If you want to gain weight you can do that in the correct way without supplements
01:46:06.56 --> 01:46:12.80 This is what you supplement like you know as you wear and tear your joints your joints don't get much blood flow like compared to muscles
01:46:12.96 --> 01:46:19.20 So they tend to get more wear and tear with less like as far as speedy recovery goes your muscle recover quicker than you joint
01:46:19.20 --> 01:46:23.76 Something you supplement something something something that that needs supplementation if you're getting out there at
01:46:23.76 --> 01:46:25.76 Crill oil
01:46:25.76 --> 01:46:27.76 That was a big lead in
01:46:27.76 --> 01:46:29.76 I'm too look I could say
01:46:30.48 --> 01:46:32.48 Take real oil it'll help your joints
01:46:32.80 --> 01:46:38.16 You're like okay, you know because every commercial or every what I'll be really take this it'll help this
01:46:39.20 --> 01:46:41.60 You need like some contact context and
01:46:43.04 --> 01:46:48.40 Like the information that kind of backs it up, you know gotta be real
01:46:48.40 --> 01:46:50.40 And this is real
01:46:50.40 --> 01:46:53.44 Nonetheless, Krill oil is one of the supplements
01:46:54.56 --> 01:46:58.48 That I recommend for your joints. I told the story about how when I get out of bed
01:46:58.72 --> 01:47:02.16 And I'd be like all jacked up because my daughter would jump on my back right out of bed
01:47:02.16 --> 01:47:07.04 You're like but you gotta warm up for that kind of stuff typically, but not not anymore because I've been on the krill
01:47:07.84 --> 01:47:13.04 Strong bone by the way for your joints as well. It's not strong bone. That's strong
01:47:13.76 --> 01:47:17.12 Yeah, I don't know the yeah, I don't know the reason you're that
01:47:17.12 --> 01:47:19.12 It's just dope like that
01:47:19.28 --> 01:47:23.04 If you're looking for it no jeet it's strong. That's for joints and stuff
01:47:23.28 --> 01:47:25.52 But what else do you take oh alpha brain of course?
01:47:26.72 --> 01:47:29.68 So the point behind all this shrimp deck shrimp tech
01:47:30.96 --> 01:47:32.96 Here's what shrimp tech does I
01:47:33.36 --> 01:47:35.84 Think everybody knows what it does here's the thing. I don't think so
01:47:36.24 --> 01:47:42.48 I think it makes you get after it for longer whatever listen to the podcast every time we say what shrimp tech does
01:47:42.48 --> 01:47:44.96 I'm gonna clarify. I'm gonna clarify. Okay
01:47:44.96 --> 01:47:48.64 You know what go for it. You know what unless it back okay
01:47:49.68 --> 01:47:55.36 I'm gonna clarify it to you and just just agree or disagree if this is correct. Okay, so
01:47:56.24 --> 01:48:00.80 I don't even have to use scientific terms. I'm just put it into perspective. So if I'm gonna
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:06.32 It's not I'm not a none of that. I don't watch it. You haven't had enough alpha brain do you scientists
01:48:06.32 --> 01:48:07.52 Different terms right now
01:48:07.52 --> 01:48:09.52 So just use whatever terms
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.96 Okay, I'm gonna do a mac on that use them quickly
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:17.28 I'm gonna do mac on I'm gonna do like 10 rounds of GJT five rounds of GJT whatever
01:48:19.28 --> 01:48:21.60 If I'm not on shrimp tech sport by the
01:48:22.16 --> 01:48:27.68 This shrimp tech immune is what she takes part so it helps you like utilize oxygen
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:32.88 So what that means is when you hit the you know when you when you're like in a car where it goes to the
01:48:32.88 --> 01:48:35.44 When you're red lining that needles hitting the red
01:48:36.40 --> 01:48:38.88 Bro you can't you can't pull ahead when you're in the red

01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:50.88 Don't be halfway through your workout when your the needle is hitting the red your red lining already you can't go past
01:48:50.88 --> 01:48:52.88 You can't push through
01:48:52.88 --> 01:48:55.68 What the shrimp tech does if you have that in you
01:48:56.96 --> 01:49:01.12 That needle won't go towards the red it'll go up there it'll go the green
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:06.96 Maybe even in the yellow and it'll hang in the yellow and you're pushing hard halfway three quarters
01:49:06.96 --> 01:49:11.68 Last you know minute two minutes of the round you won't even be by the radio still being the yellow
01:49:12.16 --> 01:49:14.16 That's what the shrimp tech does
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:16.88 Agreed agree

01:51:35.20 --> 01:51:37.20 Is the Amazon click through
01:51:37.84 --> 01:51:40.08 That's like what is if you don't know
01:51:41.52 --> 01:51:44.56 You go to our websites jockelpodcast.com
01:51:45.20 --> 01:51:51.12 Over on the side to the right you'll see just basic Amazon banner you click through there before you do shopping
01:51:51.44 --> 01:51:54.32 Your Christmas shopping or your everyday shopping
01:51:54.32 --> 01:52:00.40 And um that kind of supports the podcast it makes Amazon or Amazon gives us like a little kickback
01:52:01.92 --> 01:52:03.92 That's a good way to support
01:52:04.48 --> 01:52:06.48 I made the comparison
01:52:07.04 --> 01:52:12.24 To a little piece of sodium like seems like this teeny tiny thing because just clicking through Amazon and shopping
01:52:12.24 --> 01:52:15.04 What that's teeny tiny three second effort
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:18.96 But it does a big deal, you know as far as supporting
01:52:18.96 --> 01:52:24.32 So it means we don't have to run advertisements on the podcast
01:52:25.04 --> 01:52:30.000 Yeah, which I which I don't believe I'm gonna do it not gonna do aside from on it with technically that's
01:52:30.56 --> 01:52:34.56 Well, yeah, let's you know, but I was taking on it before this telling you
01:52:35.36 --> 01:52:37.36 Anyway, but
01:52:37.36 --> 01:52:42.88 You know what hold on a second while we go to a commercial break. Yeah, you know don't want to do that. Yeah
01:52:42.88 --> 01:52:44.88 This isn't even a commercial break this is a
01:52:46.16 --> 01:52:48.40 Part of this is the deal we're doing it
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:52.48 I'm gonna if I remember to do this. I'm gonna do like fake commercials
01:52:53.04 --> 01:52:58.08 During the next podcast or like in a podcast in the future. I'm gonna do fake commercials
01:52:58.48 --> 01:53:03.28 And I'll let make everyone just suffered through fake commercials just to see how much it's horrible
01:53:04.16 --> 01:53:06.56 And then say if you never want to hear that again
01:53:07.20 --> 01:53:09.20 Click through Amazon
01:53:09.60 --> 01:53:12.80 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good way
01:53:12.80 --> 01:53:19.20 Oh, speaking of fake commercials, so I did these two fake commercials made on videos. I've seen them. Bardis beer
01:53:19.92 --> 01:53:22.64 And then those bardis prime which is like 40 ounce
01:53:23.28 --> 01:53:26.24 It's a lot of situations stereotypes now but nonetheless
01:53:28.16 --> 01:53:32.56 Back to the Amazon click through thing. That's a good way to support so be the be the sodium
01:53:34.16 --> 01:53:36.16 If you understand
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:40.32 And of course subscribe to the podcast on iTunes that's a that's a big deal
01:53:40.32 --> 01:53:42.32 Oh
01:53:42.32 --> 01:53:43.60 And leave a review man if you're in the mood
01:53:45.12 --> 01:53:52.24 Do you read the reviews? I do read the reviews and what I noticed I was looking at some other reviews today
01:53:52.48 --> 01:53:54.48 Because I was reading I read our reviews today
01:53:55.04 --> 01:54:00.88 To see if there's any good input there was good stuff. I look at other what this kind of got me
01:54:01.44 --> 01:54:06.40 Motivated to see is that people that write our reviews they're getting in the game
01:54:06.40 --> 01:54:13.36 They're letting full paragraphs with detailed likes and pros and cons and all that you go to some other people's
01:54:13.68 --> 01:54:19.36 That that have feedback on theirs. It's just two words good podcast or I love it. Yeah
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.32 I love it five stars. Yeah, that I love it five stars is a lot different than someone saying what I really like about
01:54:26.40 --> 01:54:32.000 The jacco podcast is that they go into detail on these leadership elements that have helped me in the following ways
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000 But underneath the whole thing, yeah
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.60 That's really good support about guests. I'll tell you this about that because really when you think about it
01:54:39.60 --> 01:54:42.48 If you're just like and some of them are funny by the way
01:54:43.52 --> 01:54:45.52 And the ones for
01:54:45.52 --> 01:54:47.52 For jacco tea that our name is on
01:54:47.92 --> 01:54:52.40 I'm gonna have to figure out a way to publish them so do something with them because some of them are our awesome
01:54:52.40 --> 01:54:57.76 It's a Eric's Eric's was insane, but there's been a few of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, those are good
01:54:58.80 --> 01:55:03.52 I retweeted a bunch of them. Yeah, so everybody it's a little hard to retweet them
01:55:03.52 --> 01:55:07.52 So I have to figure out a way to retweet them better the capture screen shot or something
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:09.52 But they're so good. They're so funny
01:55:09.52 --> 01:55:14.80 Like some of them are pretty words men ask oh some of them are long some of them it takes me
01:55:15.52 --> 01:55:19.04 Six minutes to read it and I want to actually highlight stuff and take notes
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:25.36 But yeah, that's a good and they're well when you think about it
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:30.40 Even if if someone's in the mood to write a review and they're just like
01:55:30.40 --> 01:55:36.08 Dick, yeah, great podcast five stars. I see do that. That's true, too. Doesn't have to be long
01:55:36.08 --> 01:55:38.80 But you what that is when people are like this is what I like about it whatever
01:55:39.44 --> 01:55:43.36 That's just all that is is the result of someone
01:55:43.92 --> 01:55:47.68 Being in the mood to write a review and genuinely writing it
01:55:49.60 --> 01:55:53.76 Freaking awesome be on writing it. I'd say the call of I just getting after getting out
01:55:53.76 --> 01:55:59.68 Yeah, so you know you say unmedicated discipline and all things or is it getting after it in all the
01:55:59.68 --> 01:56:03.92 day daily your misnored day daily. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just
01:56:03.92 --> 01:56:08.24 Unmedicated daily discipline and all things. Me up and getting after the
01:56:08.24 --> 01:56:14.48 All things is I know that's new that still we're going with it. So so again, I'm in right a review. Subscribe to YouTube
01:56:15.84 --> 01:56:20.08 We're doing some more videos on top of the podcast videos
01:56:20.72 --> 01:56:26.56 excerpts some excerpts tell echo on Twitter what excerpts you want so he does not have to
01:56:26.56 --> 01:56:31.92 Figure out what you want just tell him what you want give them the podcast and the times time hack
01:56:32.56 --> 01:56:36.80 He'll pull it out. He'll put it on there. Yeah. Oh, well. Yeah, that's that's I think the
01:56:37.52 --> 01:56:41.28 Challenger I think is going back and finding them. Yes, but you know what that's not a challenge
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:47.28 It is it is a little bit because you might not in something might not a struck you the way it's strong
01:56:47.28 --> 01:56:51.12 Someone else yeah, that's true and so if it's striking one person out there
01:56:51.12 --> 01:56:55.68 It's probably striking at least four or five more people that want to hear that excerpt
01:56:55.68 --> 01:57:00.56 So let's give it to him so tell echo podcast number time stamp
01:57:01.28 --> 01:57:04.56 That would be easy for you right? Yes, no, because we don't want to stress you out
01:57:05.20 --> 01:57:07.20 Don't stress the delicate
01:57:07.76 --> 01:57:12.56 We know that you're sensitive to that we don't want to be disappointed in you except if you're
01:57:13.68 --> 01:57:22.40 Brady Lisa Debbie Andy anyone that we thought don't be like hey, I like this time stamp because like we said your name on the podcast
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:26.88 Make it except don't say that so those people kind of can't do that why not all right? I guess
01:57:26.88 --> 01:57:28.88 They should be there listening
01:57:28.88 --> 01:57:35.92 Yeah, yeah, they probably have good input and these ones can be like 20 seconds long hey that part where you spend good 20 seconds is fine
01:57:36.24 --> 01:57:39.36 Which do you understand echo people want to watch stuff that's 20 seconds long?
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:42.16 They don't want to watch 29 minutes
01:57:42.40 --> 01:57:45.20 That's why it's called an excerpt juggle we got a store
01:57:45.68 --> 01:57:47.68 We do have a store called joclist door
01:57:47.68 --> 01:57:54.16 Well, yeah, I know we already knew this but no real new developments there really but if you didn't know
01:57:55.04 --> 01:58:00.96 That is a good way to support and you get some stuff in your turn so boom by shirt if you're down if you like them
01:58:01.36 --> 01:58:07.04 This one is joculous face on it says good backwards backwards so if you look in the mirror
01:58:07.92 --> 01:58:09.92 It's it's for you that message is for you
01:58:12.56 --> 01:58:14.56 layers
01:58:14.56 --> 01:58:21.92 Anyway, yeah, yeah, good look at there's rash guards there rash guards are good for you know the jujuts for any physical activity where you need range of motion
01:58:21.92 --> 01:58:24.72 rash guards good they look good to according to people
01:58:26.88 --> 01:58:32.56 Here's a tip for the rash guards and I think for the shirts as well if you're one of those in betweeners like that means your site like hey
01:58:32.56 --> 01:58:37.44 I wear a large but if it fits slim I need to extra large like that kind of people
01:58:39.36 --> 01:58:44.48 It fits like this much slimmer know that slip the rash guard between her everything rash guard and the shirt
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:49.92 Go big go to the bigger size if you're in between her yeah for sure. That's just a tip good advice
01:58:50.32 --> 01:58:53.44 Because and that's good news for you though. You know what out of the past
01:58:54.24 --> 01:58:59.28 39 minutes you've been talking about this away to support the podcast that was the most important thing that you've said
01:59:00.56 --> 01:59:03.36 That was the valuable piece of information arguably
01:59:04.24 --> 01:59:07.20 Yeah, just saying over here. I respect your on the matter
01:59:07.84 --> 01:59:10.16 This some women stuff too don't neglect the ladies
01:59:10.16 --> 01:59:12.16 Um
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.64 This is in my opinion
01:59:16.96 --> 01:59:18.96 Something that I overlooked
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:25.20 If you want to support the podcast, you know you know all is like oh my girls birthday is coming up in this case Christmas coming up
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:31.28 I only bought my wife one thing and it was it wasn't that good because I don't have that creative thing if you're thinking that
01:59:31.68 --> 01:59:33.68 Get them a discipline equals freedom
01:59:34.24 --> 01:59:36.24 women's t-shirt v-neck
01:59:36.80 --> 01:59:38.80 pink
01:59:38.80 --> 01:59:44.56 Or black or do you get whatever the color you like but there is pink if you want to get them one of that against my
01:59:45.28 --> 01:59:51.20 That's it that'll have a two-pronged effect boom you get a solid shirt that you didn't you know get it the swap meat
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.28 Their quality stuff. They're good shirts. You know we made a point to get the good ones got a good quality shirt
01:59:57.84 --> 02:00:01.68 And she became instantly in the game two-pronged effect
02:00:02.64 --> 02:00:06.32 So get that for your wife if you want that's a suggested and three-pronged effects of
02:00:06.32 --> 02:00:10.000 Part the podcast boom there it is somebody's in there as well for the cold weather
02:00:11.44 --> 02:00:15.36 And yeah some patches the official like two by three can
02:00:15.92 --> 02:00:20.72 F-d flat dark earth color official where with your uniform boom
02:00:21.92 --> 02:00:24.72 Available now as they say anyway jockelster.com
02:00:27.44 --> 02:00:29.44 Also
02:00:29.44 --> 02:00:31.44 We got jocco white tea now
02:00:31.44 --> 02:00:38.80 Jocco white tea is in apparently extremely high demand why because it tastes awesome and it also
02:00:39.36 --> 02:00:43.60 Makes you feel good and it's got antioxidants it which makes you healthier
02:00:44.32 --> 02:00:48.56 Yes, and I'm not gonna use any scientific turns. I'm just gonna tell you
02:00:49.76 --> 02:00:51.92 So it's been it's been in high demand we have
02:00:52.80 --> 02:00:58.000 Logistical issues right straight up so it's showing up at Amazon it's getting going through their system
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.20 Just keep checking and we've got and I told I told everyone
02:01:04.40 --> 02:01:05.92 That we would never run out of white tea
02:01:07.44 --> 02:01:11.68 This was a mistake yeah promptly I did not understand
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.16 The logistic challenges that we would be facing now I have
02:01:17.20 --> 02:01:24.48 Not even doubled down not even tripled down I have quadrupled down to make the future
02:01:24.48 --> 02:01:29.44 Bright we will get to a point in the future
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:34.88 Where we will literally never run out of jocco white tea but for now
02:01:36.24 --> 02:01:38.24 But for now
02:01:39.04 --> 02:01:44.000 Keep checking back on Amazon sign up for the little notification thing because when we when they clear it through their little
02:01:44.40 --> 02:01:49.92 System it shows up and everyone that has the notification is buying it immediately so it's running out the other day
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:51.28 It was up for
02:01:51.28 --> 02:01:52.88 18 minutes or something it was gone
02:01:52.88 --> 02:01:55.68 Wait what not if we get on the Amazon okay?
02:01:56.24 --> 02:01:58.72 You can sign up for notifying me when this is back in stock
02:01:59.44 --> 02:02:00.96 So
02:02:00.96 --> 02:02:08.16 When that happens boom you can order it immediately the mugs the mugs that say get after it on them and that have a little
02:02:08.72 --> 02:02:12.72 Approved symbol with someone's head that looks a lot like me on it
02:02:13.44 --> 02:02:17.52 You can get those on Amazon as well and they're big they're bigger than normal
02:02:18.72 --> 02:02:20.72 because bigger
02:02:20.72 --> 02:02:23.84 That way you can fit more white tea and it and be more
02:02:25.44 --> 02:02:31.36 Better and you can get those those are also same thing on Amazon again
02:02:31.84 --> 02:02:33.04 I apologize
02:02:33.04 --> 02:02:40.56 But the way the system works they're coming in they show up and then they and then they take a certain amount of them put them into the system
02:02:40.96 --> 02:02:45.60 But then they don't realize yet an Amazon Amazon doesn't they're not in the game yet to be quite honest with you
02:02:45.60 --> 02:02:47.76 They're not in the game they don't understand what's happening
02:02:47.76 --> 02:02:54.88 We're trying to explain it to them that people want mugs they want when they want mugs they also want tea to put into the mugs
02:02:55.28 --> 02:02:59.92 We're getting there same thing logistically we'll get to a point where we will we will
02:03:00.88 --> 02:03:04.24 Not run out of mugs now. I don't know if the mugs will keep making forever
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:09.12 I don't know because once everyone has one then they'll say okay. I got mine so then we'll stop making them
02:03:09.76 --> 02:03:11.20 But
02:03:11.20 --> 02:03:18.16 You can get them on Amazon you can get the tea on Amazon you can get the reload which is a hundred bags you can get the 10 which is
02:03:18.56 --> 02:03:19.68 quality
02:03:19.68 --> 02:03:22.56 Container that you can then reload with the reload
02:03:23.20 --> 02:03:25.20 So do that that's on Amazon.com
02:03:27.36 --> 02:03:28.88 also

02:04:23.20 --> 02:04:24.48 Zero times
02:04:24.48 --> 02:04:31.12 Actually we did one when the thing was over we walked back off stage off off the off the stage and behind the curtain for about three minutes
02:04:31.12 --> 02:04:36.000 Because we were a little bit fired up at that point. We just walked back there and decompressed
02:04:36.56 --> 02:04:41.04 Then came out and started sign a book that was one time, but the rest of the time. Oh, we'd say okay everyone take a
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:47.36 10 minute break we'd go to the front and sign books, right boom or talk to people or address something or
02:04:47.92 --> 02:04:49.04 Whatever so
