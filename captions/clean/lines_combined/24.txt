00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 24 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000 And our guest tonight is Jodi Middick.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000 Jodi is a former Canadian Army soldier and sniper who served in Afghanistan.
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000 He now serves as an elected member of the Ottawa City Council.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000 You got second place in a show called the Amazing Race.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000 He authored a bestselling book about his experiences.
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000 He's a husband and a dad.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000 Beyond all that, Jodi is a real hero.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000 An absolute inspiration to anybody that knows his story,
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000 which is what we'll be talking about tonight.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000 Welcome to the show, Jodi.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000 Thank you, Jocco.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000 Did I miss anything?
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000 Jocco, make a fan?
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000 Thanks, man.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 Now I appreciate that.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000 Also with us is echo Charles.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000 Good evening, echo.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000 Good evening.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000 Now, before we dig into your book,
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000 I wanted to start off with an excerpt of a poem by Richard Kippling.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000 And it's called the Young British Soldier.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000 And I think this is a little bit appropriate since Canada's former part of the Commonwealth of England
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000 and now part of the Commonwealth.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000 And while Kippling was never actually a soldier, he did attend the United Service College in England,
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000 which kind of prepared young men for the Army,
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000 although he never joined, but he did spend many years abroad in the British colonies.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And he also lost his only son, John, in World War I,
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000 at the Battle of Luz, in September of 1915,
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000 where there was just about a hundred thousand casualties,
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000 in a matter of days, John Kippling was last seen,
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000 lurching through the mud blindly, crying out in agony.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000 After his face had been ripped apart by an exploding shell.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000 And this poem that I'm about to read a part of is not about World War I.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000 It's about the British wars that took place from the 1830s to the early 1900s
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000 in a part of the world called Afghanistan.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And here is this latter part of that poem.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000 When first under fire and you're wishful to duck,
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000 don't look or take heed at the man that is struck,
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000 be thankful you're living and trust to your luck,
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000 and march to your front like a soldier,
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000 front front front like a soldier.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000 If your officers dead in the sergeants look white,
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000 remember it's a ruin to run from a fight,
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000 so take open order, lie down and sit tight,
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000 and wait for supports like a soldier,
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000 wait, wait, wait like a soldier.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000 When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's planes,
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 and the women come out to cut up what remains,
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000 just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains,
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000 and go to your God like a soldier,
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:06.000 go go go like a soldier.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000 And I think that poem sets a tone for what kind of a place
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000 to Afghanistan can be.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000 Yeah.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000 It's been a while to hear that.
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Yeah.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 That last line's not a joke either.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000 No, it isn't.
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000 I'm going to get there in your book here in a minute.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000 Your book is called Unflinching.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000 This is the book right here.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000 And I kind of made that connection with the Unflinching part.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000 You've been a sniper.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000 You obviously can't be flinching when you're taking a shot.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Right.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000 And this whole thing kicks off the first chapter,
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 which the name of the first chapter is awesome,
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000 because this is something that I believe is something
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 that a lot of people have. I know I damn sure did.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000 The first chapter is called The Soldier in the Child.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000 And I think that describes a lot of people that joined the military.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000 Yeah.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000 That's the thing that's in there.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000 They're born with it.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000 You were born with it.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000 I know I was born with it.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000 Yeah.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000 Tell everyone to do.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Tell everyone to do.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 Tell everyone to do.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.000 Believe me.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 Now your mom, how did she feel about all that?
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000 She resisted like any 80s mom, right?
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000 You're a hell do you again?
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000 44.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000 So you're a little older than I am,
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000 but my mom being a foster kid,
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000 read all the books and all the books the time said,
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000 boy should play with Barbies and girls.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000 You play with Tanka Trucks and treat them gender neutral and blah, blah, blah,
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000 but guess what?
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000 If you put boys in a room and girls in a room with toys,
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000 the boys play with Tanka Trucks and the girls play with the Barbies.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000 I just the way it is.
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000 Yeah.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000 And my fact my son,
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 I had two daughters that were young
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000 and our house and I didn't want them.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000 I'm not going to have them have all these Barbies.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000 I don't even know where they came from.
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000 But they showed up at my house.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Yeah.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000 I guess what?
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000 My son was born and I was all worried.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000 He's going to be playing with Barbies.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000 That kid, he had kid didn't care about Barbies.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000 He didn't care about all.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000 They didn't look at him.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000 He anything that had wheels on it.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000 Yeah.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.000 It's just, and it's just,
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000 boys and girls are different.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000 Yeah.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000 They're just different.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000 And, you know what,
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000 I know lots of women that are great soldiers.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000 I'm not saying that they don't have it.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000 But mom wanted, you know,
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 no guns, GI Joe's, but no,
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 you know, couldn't keep the weapons.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000 And, you know, and I, and I love her for it because
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000 Who knows who I would have been if she had,
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000 maybe if she had fostered it,
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000 it would have, it would have fizzled out.
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000 I don't know.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000 But yeah, all I want to do is soldier.
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000 Since I was a, since I was a little boy.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000 So your mom had that attitude and then along came Uncle Jim.
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000 Yeah.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.000 Yeah.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Uncle Jim.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 They don't tell us a little bit about Uncle Jim.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000 Well, I mean,
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000 I just saw him the last week and actually he lives in Victoria.
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000 We're, we're Mr. Echo is born and he,
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000 when you're a child, right?
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 There's nothing more impressionable than a three year old.
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000 Really, right?
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000 And when I was three, he would back then.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000 If you were in uniform, you could ride the train for free
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000 and get the bus for free.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000 And so he would ride the train in uniform when he had his,
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000 leave.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 And he'd show up at the house and he'd bring me teddy bears.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 And I was like, this is obviously the coolest dude ever.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000 And whatever he does, I want to do it.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000 And he would tell stories about what he did, you know,
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000 and he was, you know, he was an infantry soldier.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000 Same regiment that I joined.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000 And, and that was the seed.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000 I assume no one really knows.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000 This is just family lore.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000 Right.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000 Where, because mom didn't like it.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000 Dad was a blue collar, auto worker.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000 His dad was in the army,
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000 but it was like conscripted into the Serbian border guard.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000 When the, when the, when the German army showed up,
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000 he basically threw his hands up.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000 Was like, yep, I'm cool.
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 Don't shoot.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000 You know, mom's dad apparently was in the army,
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000 but no one knows because he died when she was 10.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000 No one's really sure what he did.
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000 You know, apparently he was in Korea,
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000 but there's no record of it.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000 So, anyway, it's just,
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000 it was there.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000 And Jim, I think, was the catalyst.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000 That sparked it.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000 It sparked it when I was just a young little impressionable boy.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000 That happens.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000 Now, when you've got to be a teenager.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000 You know, you kind of sounded in the book.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000 You sound like, yes, you sound like a teenager.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000 Yeah.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000 And I mean, just to go here in your book,
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000 you say, I was a loner who didn't fit in.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000 I still dreamt of being in the army,
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000 probably because I wanted to belong to something.
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000 Yeah.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000 And it was definitely clear I didn't belong in school.
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000 I hated school.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000 I hate, especially because when you get to high school,
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000 and I don't know how you guys,
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000 I've heard you talk a little bit about it.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000 It sounded like you had the same issues.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000 Couldn't connect with any of your teachers.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 The only teacher I remember I had this one teacher.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000 I forget his name, but he was Scottish originally.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 And he was my history teacher.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000 Like the only subject I cared about was history, really.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000 And he would tell stories about everything else he ever did in life
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000 before he was a teacher.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000 And I was like, okay, this guy actually has some shit
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000 that I need to hear because he's been around the world
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000 and he's done everything.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000 The rest of them.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000 I joined, I don't know if he came to teach you how to call it.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000 I didn't know how to type.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000 And I'd be like, why am I even here?
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000 What am I doing here?
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000 Doing math?
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 I, you know, snipers, you know,
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000 we eat ballistic charts for breakfast.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000 And math was useless to me in high school.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000 And yeah, I just delass thing I wanted to be was in school.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000 And I actually, because this was the 90s, right?
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000 So that was still when you could quit school to join the army.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000 And I was like, oh, I'm just going to quit school and join the army.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000 And my parents, like, basically had to beg me to stay.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000 They let me join the reserves, which in Canada is called the militia.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000 And it's like, once a week and a week and a month.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000 And they're like, you can do that, but don't quit school.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000 Finish school.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000 All right.
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000 But it was like completely against my will.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000 But they finally got you, they finally let you join.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000 You joined the militia.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000 Right.
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000 And then, but you weren't still in acupuncturne.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000 Well, the militia in Canada, you can be called up to active duty.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000 But it's not like we chatted a little bit about this on the way here where you guys
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000 have a different system here because yours is much bigger.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000 But also like the militia in Canada was the military before World War Two, basically.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000 So regiments were local.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 It was a part-time thing.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000 You know, it was kind of like, it was the what is that?
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000 What do they call it?
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000 The citizen soldier.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000 And the regular army was just there to kind of give them an enemy force and take care of the machine guns and the howitzers.
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000 Like, that doesn't there so that we had at the time.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000 And it wasn't until after World War Two that it flipped because it was, you know, the Cold War started in all that jazz.
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000 So, you know, at any time, the regular army now into the 90s could say, you know what?
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000 We need 10 reserve soldiers to fill in a platoon here.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:15.000 And if you could volunteer, and I remember when I showed up to my reserve unit, there were sergeants sewing private stripes under their uniform because they were called up to the regular army.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000 But you're not a sergeant.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000 You're like, you're qualified because to keep guys in the reserves, they promote them fast.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000 But when you go work with the regs, like they're not going to call you a sergeant, you've been in as long as corporal Smith.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000 Uh-huh, private stripes, bitch. But guys, guys would fight each other to get those slots though.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000 Because there was nothing better, more honorable than to deploy with a reg for his regiment.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000 Absolutely.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000 And go, you know, peacekeeping, but you know, there are still a few gun fights here and there.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000 I thought this was cool in the book. You talked about this here.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000 You're basically starting boot camp.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 And you say, you just get your haircut.
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000 Yeah.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000 Get your head shaved for the first time.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000 Once the barber was done, I studied myself and his mirror.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000 I barely recognized the young man staring back at me.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000 The eyes were the same, but everything else was different.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 I wasn't jody-middick.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000 Lay about loaner, high school, good for nothing.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000 Another floundering adolescent with no ambition and no life plan.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000 That kid was lying under a pile of hair on the floor.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000 Looking back at me was jody-middick soldier in training.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000 I was good boss.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000 So legit.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000 Yeah.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000 Well, so I had, at the time, lethal weapon, too, was my favorite movie ever.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000 So I had like attempted.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000 You're a straight male Gibson hero.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000 Oh, dude.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000 It was glorious.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Oh, you should have seen it.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000 Oh, it's next.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000 Yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000 We've walked around smoking cigarettes and pretend.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000 Yeah, anyway, just being ridiculous.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000 But, you know, it happened to me again recently because I had grown my beard out
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000 and I had a bit of, I had some long hair and I did, I did it.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000 I shaved the beard down to nothing and I went to the barber who usually, like,
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000 does his best to give me a little bit of length, but still make me look professional.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000 And I said, I want you to give me a number one all around.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000 That's what I'm talking about.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000 And this was just, this was just like a month ago.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000 And, you know, he did all that.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000 You know, your skin feels cold because now the air is on it and I looked in the mirror
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000 and it was almost the same feeling I went, oh, oh, there he is.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000 I was like, there's that soldier.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000 And I remember the feeling because it was the guy's name was Markle.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000 He was the Italian guy who cut my hair.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000 And he couldn't believe it because he had fostered this ridiculous
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000 mullet for the last two years.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000 And now I said shave it off because I showed him a picture of a marine.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000 And I want to look like this guy.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000 And when he shaved it and then it,
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000 it was like, I was at the starting line of like the biggest race I'd ever
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 going to run in my life.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000 And all I could think about was getting to the end and being successful.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000 And it changed my life, man.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000 It changed my life.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000 Yeah, you know, one thing that, because when I was a kid, you know, I was into,
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000 this is going a little bit tangential.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000 But I was into the hardcore scene on the East Coast.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Yes, hardcore music. That's what I grew up with.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000 And it was like, yeah, shaved heads, getting after it.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000 But one of my best friend at the time, he's like, listen, you know,
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000 where part of this, where there's nowhere to hide.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000 You can't hide behind your bangs.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 It's all right there. You got to face yourself.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000 Nice.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000 And it also strips away, you know, any kind of, I mean, hair is basically,
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000 what's that word?
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000 It's basically for show.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000 I mean, what hair is?
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000 It's just, it won't beなる.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000 Side.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Because of the hair is, it stands out like normal fashion.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000 So, you know, the hair isn't a alchemist.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 It's organized?
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000 So, you know, I know that I've never actually smoked a shots ever.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000 So, I, there is no purpose other than I look good.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000 So, let's just go ahead and remove that.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000 I don't care what I look like.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000 I'm here to win.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000 So, yeah, I guess that may dissplay my hair cut.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000 And so.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000 But it, um, I'm glad you picked that sight that that paragraph because
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000 when I did this a month ago is, when I started my training for well,
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.20 I know how to eat well. I know how to work out of a workout. I was like 16
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.06 But I just wasn't it wasn't clicking you know, and I went the barber and I did that and it was like the switch went off
00:15:18.06 --> 00:15:20.86 Boom and there it was. It was like oh I'm back at that starting line
00:15:21.60 --> 00:15:27.84 I'm gonna be 40 in January. So I want a six pack before I'm 40. I don't know. So it's like I blown up. I haven't had one
00:15:28.44 --> 00:15:30.44 That's been 10 years
00:15:31.44 --> 00:15:35.56 Right on all right. So now we get into this next section now you're kind of
00:15:35.56 --> 00:15:39.36 Learning about what the army's like and here's some stuff that you said about it
00:15:39.36 --> 00:15:45.94 There was a system for everything in the army a way to stand and a way to sit a way to dress and a way to sleep
00:15:46.40 --> 00:15:50.88 There's also a way to a system for how to properly eat at the mess hall
00:15:51.76 --> 00:15:59.44 Our routine was an endless monotonous cycle. We woke up made our cops folded our sleeping bags in the exact way we'd been taught
00:16:00.04 --> 00:16:02.82 Once the tent was in shape it was on the barracks box
00:16:02.82 --> 00:16:08.30 Barric boxes we had to lay them out as instructed with everything in its proper place
00:16:08.42 --> 00:16:16.02 Whether it made sense or not we had to stand beside our kit and cops everyone perfectly still as the officer did inspection
00:16:17.10 --> 00:16:22.04 At the time I thought that so much of this discipline was overkill
00:16:22.62 --> 00:16:28.64 Why did we have to stand to detention when the officer was on the other side of the tent looking at some other dudes cotton kit?
00:16:28.64 --> 00:16:32.16 Why did our barracks boxes have to be identical?
00:16:32.16 --> 00:16:38.44 It took me a couple years to figure out that the skills they were drilling into us are actually really important for a combat leader
00:16:38.80 --> 00:16:42.36 If you can't still stand still long enough for morning inspection
00:16:42.68 --> 00:16:46.36 How can your commanders trust you to hold your post during a mortar barrage?
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:52.44 How will a leader know he can count on you to be a useful soldier if you can't even follow through on an order
00:16:52.44 --> 00:17:00.84 meant to keep you in your comrades safe even if you don't know it at the time all these drills were training me to put self-discipline
00:17:01.32 --> 00:17:04.32 above my instinct to flinch or flee
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:09.44 When everything in me told me to break my posture to stand down
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:12.96 I learned to obey a different order instead
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:23.76 It was basic training but I was assimilating some important skills that would later make me a better sniper
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:31.08 Now I talk about discipline all the time and that's obviously why I honed in on this because you kind of captured
00:17:31.96 --> 00:17:34.48 The kind of things that they're teaching you discipline
00:17:34.96 --> 00:17:41.08 They're teaching you discipline and if you don't make that connection for all you young troopers out there that are getting ready to join the military
00:17:41.08 --> 00:17:44.08 There's a purpose there's a reason behind it
00:17:49.08 --> 00:17:51.08 A definite purpose
00:17:53.08 --> 00:17:57.08 And you know that's part of my book is the book that I wrote with Lave
00:17:58.08 --> 00:18:03.08 You know, I just wanted to call this a clinical freedom. There's another chapter in there. It happens to be called cover and move
00:18:04.08 --> 00:18:06.08 Yeah, and
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:14.08 You know, we related to everything we do to me. There's no other tactic and again, I had to call this out in your book and by the way, I'm reading your book right now
00:18:15.08 --> 00:18:23.08 And I was trying to figure out how to do this. Yeah, like should I say, okay, can you read this section and then I thought to myself
00:18:25.08 --> 00:18:27.08 It's going to be different for you to hear it
00:18:28.08 --> 00:18:34.08 Coming from someone else to hear the words and when I looked up at you after reading that first section I was like he just enjoyed that
00:18:34.08 --> 00:18:35.08 I did
00:18:35.08 --> 00:18:44.08 Yeah, because you're hearing it. You can't you can never hear it when you hear yourself read it. You're it's like I don't know I have my own reaction because they're my words
00:18:45.08 --> 00:18:50.08 But especially from someone like like you someone who shared
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:53.08 Relatively common experiences
00:18:53.08 --> 00:19:08.08 And you know, I was a snab or team leader. You were a you were a task force leader and for us to have a similar reaction to the same types of things is it's very interesting for me to see as well to see someone like
00:19:09.08 --> 00:19:17.08 Like, jacco read the same thing that I went through and go, yes, exactly because you got it. It took me a couple years to realize like I said
00:19:17.08 --> 00:19:23.08 Why am I standing here? This is stupid. This is because just go out. Let's just go with their entrain what you are training bitch
00:19:24.08 --> 00:19:30.08 You're learning how to do what you're told and you're learning how to back because if you take off from your barracks box
00:19:31.08 --> 00:19:40.08 Well, guess who's going to pay for it the guy next to you and you know beyond doing what you're told even in that paragraph you pointed out look the the inspectors look in the other direction
00:19:40.08 --> 00:19:48.08 You could easily break your posture. Yeah, you know, he's not going to see you. He's never going to catch you, but guess what you held the line. Yeah, you held the line
00:19:48.08 --> 00:19:58.08 And that's what you're learning is that no matter what no matter what people are looking at or not you're going to do your job that you're duty right it's your job. It's the job right it's the job and people
00:19:59.08 --> 00:20:06.08 What makes a good soldier at someone who understands their job is to be that soldier and I know okay
00:20:06.08 --> 00:20:17.08 I know what I'm saying and you know what I'm saying, but you got to go through that to really understand it and me and you can give advice all day to people like new new guys we get
00:20:17.08 --> 00:20:25.08 When you tweeted out I was coming oh, I'm getting ready to go on selection. I'm getting ready to go to just I want to be a sniper. I'm joining the infantry. What do I do? What do I do?
00:20:25.08 --> 00:20:36.08 I can give you advice all day. Jockel can give you advice all day, but man there's something you just got to learn on your own and that's that standing there with your boots polished at full at you know standing at the child
00:20:37.08 --> 00:20:48.08 Wondering why you had to iron your shirt again is going to help you later on when you're under enemy machine gun fire and mortars are coming down trust me. That's just going to help you
00:20:49.08 --> 00:20:51.08 But you're going to learn that on your own.
00:20:51.08 --> 00:21:06.08 Now back to cover move. Here you go talking about cover move in our pairs one guy would move forward while the other guy would shoot to provide cover the move would yell moving and jump up and move forward about three steps saying it is head up he sees me down
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:15.08 While as partner covered him at down the mover would take cover going to ground taking up a firing position and yelling covering once in position
00:21:15.08 --> 00:21:25.08 Then his partner would move forward the same way the idea was to always have a foot on the ground which means one soldier is covering while the other is moving boom
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:31.08 And you said to break that out on your own team at work now in the civilian sector right
00:21:32.08 --> 00:21:37.08 Yeah, yeah, we had lunch and the best thing I got out of reading your book
00:21:37.08 --> 00:21:48.08 My transition was a weird one. Okay politics is not business, but there are some business aspects and that I am now dealing with people that aren't
00:21:49.08 --> 00:21:59.08 You know, I'm used to working in small teams with people that are professionals at what we do you know so snipers and even though that was 10 years ago that's basically my last real working environment
00:21:59.08 --> 00:22:10.08 That's what you know is that's what I know so if even if I'm the boss and you're my sniper and I go echo I need you to take up this position I can go away come back that position's taken
00:22:11.08 --> 00:22:19.08 But when you're dealing with civilian staff who have never operated in that kind of or we say operated they've never worked in that kind of environment
00:22:19.08 --> 00:22:31.08 If I tell them to do something and walk away you better come back and check because they're not used to that kind of freedom because it's discipline but it's you're giving them I'm giving you the freedom to do the job I gave you
00:22:32.08 --> 00:22:36.08 You don't need me to double check that you took up the proper sniper position
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:45.08 And then also the fire and the cover and move the foot on the ground I realized after reading your book I went so jocco just
00:22:45.08 --> 00:22:53.08 Basically was like listen dummy that's how I felt I felt like a dummy. I'm like of course I should have implemented this in the office
00:22:54.08 --> 00:23:00.08 My people were operating in silos because I had my my because I'm the sports commissioner for the city so I had a sports
00:23:01.08 --> 00:23:06.08 One of my assistants was on sports one of my assistants was on pop the policy one of my assistants was on
00:23:07.08 --> 00:23:11.08 Con constituency work and that's where you deal with the the voters who call it
00:23:11.08 --> 00:23:16.08 But none of them were talking to each other and I was only talking to them sporadically
00:23:17.08 --> 00:23:18.08 So I said okay guys from
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:25.08 Starting today I didn't tell them why though. I wasn't like I wasn't gonna say hey this guy jocco gave me an idea. I said hey guys. I got an idea
00:23:26.08 --> 00:23:33.08 From now on CC you're gonna CC him and you're gonna CC him back whenever you send an email
00:23:34.08 --> 00:23:36.08 And then I'm gonna CC you and you're gonna CC me
00:23:36.08 --> 00:23:46.08 Within that week our productivity like 100% improvement because now instead of everyone was just aware of what what the others were doing and and their things that
00:23:47.08 --> 00:23:48.08 I
00:23:48.08 --> 00:23:52.08 Already know but now I got to learn to apply them in my civilian life
00:23:53.08 --> 00:23:57.08 Because I'm not working with highly trained snipers anymore. I'm working with people that are good at their jobs
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:02.08 But not necessarily the way that I expect them to be and
00:24:02.08 --> 00:24:07.08 It you know there's so much we were talking about it right before we pressed record about
00:24:08.08 --> 00:24:16.08 Why is you your the last podcast was the art of war and and and to us it's kind of like a duck you know Joe Rogan says all the time. It's a duh
00:24:17.08 --> 00:24:18.08 That's a duh thing but
00:24:19.08 --> 00:24:28.08 There's so much you can take from that book and up and there's a reason why fortune 500 CEOs keep it in their desk because it you can apply a lot of what Sun Sioux said
00:24:28.08 --> 00:24:40.08 3000 years ago to right now and just your daily life to your interactions with your kids interactions with your your boss or your subordinates or your supplier or your you know your your colleagues
00:24:41.08 --> 00:24:44.08 It's all right there. It's just you got a translate it, you know, it's not
00:24:45.08 --> 00:24:49.08 Difficult ground. It's you know, it's a position you have to take on an issue
00:24:51.08 --> 00:24:52.08 So
00:24:52.08 --> 00:25:02.08 Yeah, like I get I get it's a trip to me this whole life this whole thing. It's a it's human nature. Yeah, that that thread of human nature runs through
00:25:03.08 --> 00:25:13.08 From 25 hundred years ago, it's on Sioux through war through life through business through the relationships that you now have with your kids. Yeah, it's everywhere
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:15.08 Kid
00:25:15.08 --> 00:25:26.08 Now you since you were a militia you actually went back to school after you went to boot camp. Yeah, so you get back to school. This is very typical
00:25:27.08 --> 00:25:36.08 Before militia training, I'd been so bored at school and found everything tedious and pointless but after eight weeks of soldier training school seemed like a breeze
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:44.08 I started arriving on time and paying attention to lessons in the military you can direct your career according to your aptitudes and interests
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:53.08 So I decided to do the same at school instead of taking classes I hated I picked ones. I knew I would enjoy my grades improved because I was doing more of what I wanted to do
00:25:54.08 --> 00:25:58.08 For the first time I had discipline and self direction
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:09.08 And instead of all that energy being repressed or coming out the wrong way I had focus I went from being a loner and keeping to myself to becoming more outgoing and popular at school
00:26:13.08 --> 00:26:15.08 That discipline goes a long way
00:26:16.08 --> 00:26:24.08 It really goes along and see I went to college after I'd been in the seal teams for eight years. No, sorry 10 years
00:26:24.08 --> 00:26:32.08 So when I went to college I was like, oh, bring it bring it on. I've got to study every little thing you say and I'm going to know it better than you
00:26:33.08 --> 00:26:44.08 But I found I was a better student after going through boot camp and basic training and just like learning became easier. Yeah, oh, yeah
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:50.08 Even if I didn't want to know what they were talking about. Yeah, and that's something that the army poses on you is that will teach you something
00:26:50.08 --> 00:26:57.08 For the first time you because in civilian world on your kid they go, you got to learn this and you don't study and next thing you know you don't really know it
00:26:58.08 --> 00:27:03.08 Then you take the test and you fail and you're like, oh, I'm not smart. I'm going to the army like, no, you will learn this
00:27:04.08 --> 00:27:10.08 And then you learn it and you say, oh, okay, that's how I learned I actually have to apply myself and study and now I'm going to get an A
00:27:11.08 --> 00:27:17.08 Which is awesome. So then now you still weren't active in the military and you want to get your factory work on
00:27:17.08 --> 00:27:26.08 Yeah, well, I was I was as active as I had to be because it's you know, it's part time right, right, and then you know, there was a girl
00:27:27.08 --> 00:27:34.08 Just beautiful Russian girlfriend and you know, dad got me a great paying job
00:27:35.08 --> 00:27:40.08 But I'll let you say yeah, no, that's that's good and then finally you were like, okay, I'm ready to
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:49.08 I mean you worked in that factory situation for so long that you said I'm going to go well, that's about a year and I was making money that like it was like 25 bucks an hour
00:27:50.08 --> 00:28:04.08 I was 19 was a 96 I think and I hated it. I'm sorry dad if you're if you hear this because he got me the job, but it was his parent company because he was an union using the we had the Canadian auto worker
00:28:05.08 --> 00:28:07.08 down here with it's the United Auto Workers
00:28:07.08 --> 00:28:09.08 and
00:28:09.08 --> 00:28:11.08 and
00:28:11.08 --> 00:28:19.08 just it just it just it was soul crushing for me for me and nothing against guys I can do it
00:28:20.08 --> 00:28:25.08 There are guys that have worked there 30 years. They put the same rivet in over and over and over again for eight hours a day
00:28:26.08 --> 00:28:32.08 And they're masters at it and they love it and they punch their card and they go home and they do their thing wasn't for joty
00:28:32.08 --> 00:28:51.08 I know so you get back you now you go full active duty. Yes, come yeah you become a soldier by profession right so I I do what we call a transfer to the regular force and then on top of that usually you're supposed to go through training again
00:28:52.08 --> 00:28:58.08 depending on your level of experience because I was only both three years so I should have gone through
00:28:58.08 --> 00:29:03.08 What what back what's called battle school and that's that's the regular armies
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:09.08 battle school to become an infantry soldier for whatever reason the decision was made that I wouldn't
00:29:11.08 --> 00:29:19.08 Okay, so you don't go back in and but you're our back active duty and now you think that joty was all super square to wait now, but you weren't for you
00:29:20.08 --> 00:29:23.08 Well, it was a rough transition jocco and
00:29:23.08 --> 00:29:27.08 Yeah, that came after
00:29:27.08 --> 00:29:35.08 Yeah, we don't you're actually do you right well, yeah, I'm a full time private I was a corporal in the reserves right busted back down to private
00:29:36.08 --> 00:29:39.08 Show up there's a lot of politics going on
00:29:40.08 --> 00:29:45.08 Right now and at this time because the regular armies being told it has to take reserves
00:29:46.08 --> 00:29:51.08 Whereas before it was like if you need them you can take them now it's even if you don't need them
00:29:51.08 --> 00:29:53.08 You're going to take 30%
00:29:54.08 --> 00:30:02.08 So you have a battalion of infantry guys. Let's say one RCR at full strength is usually at this time. It was about 700
00:30:04.08 --> 00:30:17.08 Cut 30% off of active duty good to go guys and now they're put aside and 30% reserve is show up to take their spot out. Yeah, so
00:30:17.08 --> 00:30:25.08 That and this was mandated by our headquarters and so the politics within the unit was kind of we're allowed to swear on this right?
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:35.08 Yeah, the red forest guys are all like fuck you and the horse you came in on and and that horse is mom and anybody else associated with that horse
00:30:36.08 --> 00:30:42.08 I show up they thought because I was it they thought I was a reserve because the RCR has a reserve battalion
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:55.08 So they thought I was a reserve RCR and then when they found out I was a direct entry which means I go directly from the reserves into the Reg force without going through the RCR battle school
00:30:56.08 --> 00:30:59.08 Huh, so they just gave you that cat badge
00:31:00.08 --> 00:31:02.08 Well, yeah, but I did basic training in the reserves
00:31:03.08 --> 00:31:05.08 Three years ago
00:31:05.08 --> 00:31:13.08 Oh, you did huh and I got man it was rough. It was a rough, but it and it got rough because you got in trouble
00:31:14.08 --> 00:31:21.08 Yeah, yeah, so I don't know why you by the way just so you know you wrote this in the book that's been published. Yeah acting like this didn't happen
00:31:22.08 --> 00:31:29.08 Now's a little bit too late. You got arrested. I did get arrested. I don't trust anyone who hasn't at least been handcuffed. Yeah, that's good point right
00:31:29.08 --> 00:31:41.08 I made a mistake so we were now I the preamble to this was that I did eventually get sent to the RCR battles and that's where I did get arrested
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:52.08 Another one of the trainees and I well the whole platoon went out of course being young men. We somehow found ourselves at a gentleman's nightclub
00:31:52.08 --> 00:32:01.08 And we were enjoying our evening and one of the guys who decided he wanted to get some cocaine and I was held by 20
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:05.08 I had never even seen this stuff except for in Miami, vice
00:32:06.08 --> 00:32:13.08 And I'm like what's the point we're already here. We're having fun. I've already got a few drinks got some girls sitting with us why why leave
00:32:14.08 --> 00:32:18.08 And he was adamant so I guess in his civilian life this was something he got got into
00:32:18.08 --> 00:32:28.08 And in my mind I was just like okay, so he's gonna like leave on his own and go somewhere where again like in Miami, vice
00:32:29.08 --> 00:32:33.08 It's always like the worst part of town. Guess what it was the worst part of town
00:32:34.08 --> 00:32:40.08 So I'm like okay, I'm gonna go with you. I don't I don't need any but but I'll be there in case they try to mug your jump. Yeah
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:51.08 Or jump yeah turns out he was buying it from an undercover cop because you know like who else you're gonna buy it off right and then when after they bust us
00:32:52.08 --> 00:32:57.08 So we're like walking back to the club and like okay finally right I can get back and start hanging with the girls again
00:32:58.08 --> 00:33:05.08 So I get my drink on we get tackled by guys bigger than you and I and like they're the so they're the under the the night guys
00:33:05.08 --> 00:33:11.08 And they're like what do you do and you create they look at our idea. You're guys are in the army and you're going to smoke crack and I'm like
00:33:12.08 --> 00:33:17.08 What I look at the guy I'm like what's he talking about he's like well I might have
00:33:18.08 --> 00:33:22.08 They might not have had any coax I might have bought and I'm like oh my gosh, I'm just like
00:33:24.08 --> 00:33:32.08 But now that's the reality of my life right and I can't there's no going back. There's no changing it and it was it was
00:33:32.08 --> 00:33:36.08 It was at the time I described it as the worst year of my life
00:33:37.08 --> 00:33:42.08 But maybe it was the best the subsequent year because it taught me a lot about myself
00:33:43.08 --> 00:33:48.08 Yeah, and that's the main reason why I kind of wanted to tell that yeah, I wanted you to talk about that because
00:33:49.08 --> 00:33:52.08 Number one like you said it's a mistake that you made that
00:33:53.08 --> 00:34:00.08 You know I've had that feeling to before where you're you're just like okay, this is my reality now. There's no you can't go backwards. You're cuffed
00:34:00.08 --> 00:34:02.08 Yeah, and yet
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:08.08 You had you transition from it and in the book here's how you kind of talk about that transition because they're going to send you back to
00:34:09.08 --> 00:34:15.08 Meford. What's it meford meford was the battle school? So they're going to send you to the battle school for another crack at it
00:34:16.08 --> 00:34:20.08 Your third crack. Well, my second crack at battle school, but my third
00:34:21.08 --> 00:34:22.08 Infantry course
00:34:23.08 --> 00:34:26.08 So here's what you did and by the way you were teeter tottering this whole time
00:34:26.08 --> 00:34:31.08 They don't know if they're going to kick you out they might let you in because just to everybody knows the cops even took your side
00:34:31.08 --> 00:34:35.08 And you know they said hey this guy didn't have anything to do with it, but didn't matter the military will sometimes
00:34:36.08 --> 00:34:41.08 guilty by association. Yeah, so the the the the the the the police department was like jodie you clearly
00:34:42.08 --> 00:34:46.08 Had nothing to do with it, but yeah guilty by association right and so
00:34:47.08 --> 00:34:53.08 They go back and forth find the you get orders. Okay. We're going to let you stay in and now you say this. I had two choices
00:34:53.08 --> 00:35:02.08 I could be pissed off forever and feel hard done by or I could go back to Meford with a new attitude and make the best of it
00:35:03.08 --> 00:35:13.08 I could keep my head high and get off the bus with the shiniest boots the best press uniform the best laid out kit and the best attitude and being the best shape of anybody there
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:17.08 And that's what you did so I did
00:35:17.08 --> 00:35:23.08 So anybody that's out there that's listening to this podcast that hit a little bump in the road. That's what you do
00:35:25.08 --> 00:35:29.08 You show up with the best attitude the best shape
00:35:30.08 --> 00:35:36.08 With your head held high and you get after it extreme ownership you got to own it. Yeah, there's no hiding from it
00:35:37.08 --> 00:35:42.08 There's no explaining your way out of it. There's no side no sideways maneuver you're going to make your that guy
00:35:42.08 --> 00:35:50.08 I was that guy. Oh, there's that guy. Yeah, so now fast forward a little bit
00:35:51.08 --> 00:36:01.08 You deploy now you're now your legit part of the regiment. Yep finally and you deploy to Kosovo which at the time was a real world mission
00:36:02.08 --> 00:36:06.08 I'm sure you were fired up. I know I would have been fired. I think go to Kosovo, but I would have been fired up to go to Kosovo
00:36:06.08 --> 00:36:15.08 Oh, because it was the only game in town. I still remember when our seat when our commanding officer said he got we gathered up in the parade hall and he said
00:36:16.08 --> 00:36:22.08 When our CR is going to Kosovo and I still remember I was, you know, you know, you know, I have it at ease. You got your hand behind your back
00:36:23.08 --> 00:36:32.08 My hand went into a fist and I had to stop myself from doing a fist bump. I was like, yeah, you were going to become James Bond Chuck Norris and Rambo all
00:36:32.08 --> 00:36:34.08 One moment is going to be glorious
00:36:35.08 --> 00:36:43.08 So you go to Kosovo and and you know what we're kind of joking about it, but it was a legit mission at the time there was there was stuff that was happening there
00:36:44.08 --> 00:36:53.08 I like this little section here. You got you're talking about the Russians because your station near some Russian folks and you said this we like to think we're tough as Canadians
00:36:54.08 --> 00:36:59.08 But it turned out this Russian unit where we're Russian airborne who'd come from the fighting in Cheshnia
00:36:59.08 --> 00:37:03.08 And we've gone into some pretty good days talking about Cheshnia. We talked about Cheshnia in here
00:37:04.08 --> 00:37:12.08 These guys took things to a whole new level. They were hardcore soldiers. We would complain when our showers weren't giving us warm water
00:37:12.08 --> 00:37:19.08 Then we'd look over to the Russian camp and see soldiers outside in minus 25 degrees washing themselves with snow
00:37:20.08 --> 00:37:22.08 Or out in t-shirts cutting firewood
00:37:22.08 --> 00:37:26.08 These guys were sleeping in a world war two air attempts
00:37:26.08 --> 00:37:33.08 While we were sweating inside our heated barracks and every morning they'd be outside in the ball freezing cold running
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:37.08 Doing chin-ups and bench pressing big truck tires
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:46.08 These guys were legit. Yeah, yeah, and we didn't know there is some there was some stuff going on at the
00:37:46.08 --> 00:37:50.08 Pristina airport at that time. That's why they were there. Do you remember do you remember this situation at all?
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.08 So NATO did its bombing thing, right? Bomb the Syrians out of Kosovo basically
00:37:57.08 --> 00:38:03.08 And then it was like okay, so a NATO stabilization for his K4 the Kosovo stable is whatever it was
00:38:04.08 --> 00:38:10.08 Was going to move in and you know everyone was going to get a sector British Russian or British Canadian French Bobbubla
00:38:10.08 --> 00:38:20.08 Right as we're like loading up on our vehicles that brigade or I don't know how many big it was of Russians just basically showed up
00:38:21.08 --> 00:38:25.08 In the middle of the night at the Pristina airport, which was also a military airport
00:38:25.08 --> 00:38:33.08 And they set up a perimeter around this like mountain bunker in there which just recently I read an article about it and they were like yeah
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:37.08 Hey guys, it's been however it's been 20 years. This is what was in there
00:38:37.08 --> 00:38:45.08 Oh shit. It was full of stuff that shouldn't have been there. So that's that's why everybody was like what are they doing here? Why do they only want to be there?
00:38:45.08 --> 00:38:51.08 Because they were like yeah, we're here to help guys. We're just going to be right here in this area. Don't ever come in here or we'll or we'll kill you
00:38:51.08 --> 00:38:56.08 But we'll be right here. We're just here to help. Don't big deal. We want to we want to be part of the part of the exercise
00:38:57.08 --> 00:39:05.08 But they were there to guard this this like bunker and there is like a lot of there is like I guess there is some nuclear biological weapons in there and and some migs
00:39:05.08 --> 00:39:14.08 That should never have been in that part of Europe apparently and in the middle of the night you'd hear planes taking off and nobody knew what they were
00:39:17.08 --> 00:39:22.08 But you know nothing really of substantial events happened in Kosovo
00:39:22.08 --> 00:39:27.08 You get home from that and this is when you get the opportunity to go to sniper training, which is
00:39:27.08 --> 00:39:33.08 You know outstanding and and I thought you did a great job here of pointing out what a
00:39:33.08 --> 00:39:42.08 Snipers because people have little ideas in their heads about what a sniper is and here's jodys version of what a sniper is a
00:39:43.08 --> 00:39:48.08 True sniper is someone who's willing to do pretty much anything to accomplish the mission
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:55.08 The sniper has a particular mindset and shooting is actually one of the easier parts of the role
00:39:55.08 --> 00:40:09.08 I've seen men at the rifle range who are amazing marksmen, but who would be terrible snipers because they don't have the patience they lack the ability to deny their own needs and to put the mission first
00:40:10.08 --> 00:40:15.08 A true sniper will make himself uncomfortable just to make the shot
00:40:18.08 --> 00:40:24.08 That is something so true the guys think that the that what a sniper is someone that shoots really well
00:40:24.08 --> 00:40:34.08 Yeah, that's that's the least that's the easiest thing I can teach you right if I need you to be a sniper that's the easiest thing I can get you to do you know the movie shooter
00:40:35.08 --> 00:40:40.08 With our buddy Mark Wahlberg there. I have not seen it. It's based on a book about
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:53.08 A Vietnam era sniper or something but anyway, he takes this like guy who just teams up with them for the movie and he makes them the shooter like the the he teaches him how to shoot because that's the easy per
00:40:53.08 --> 00:40:59.08 All that other stuff I talk about that's the part I'm looking for that's what I'm looking for in a sniper
00:41:00.08 --> 00:41:09.08 You can shoot all day. I could put you on the range and you could shoot bulls eyes from 900 meters all day as long as you got your gatorade as long as you get your 10 minute break
00:41:09.08 --> 00:41:11.08 As long as you get up and go pee pee
00:41:11.64 --> 00:41:13.64 But what if I don't let you do any of that stuff
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:21.28 Then what oh is it sunny out on less too bad. Yeah, it's sunny out. Well, it's always it gonna rain. Yep. Don't get up
00:41:22.08 --> 00:41:26.08 Your target might come up, but what if there's ants crawling and biting your eyes?
00:41:27.24 --> 00:41:34.08 The eyes is problematic. I would it I would allow you to scratch the answer to your eyes, but but your target might come up while you're scratching
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:36.08 It
00:41:36.08 --> 00:41:38.08 I wouldn't get up if I was you the
00:41:38.08 --> 00:41:44.08 All the sniper courses definitely you talk about in the book you talk about stalking and that's something that no one I haven't seen that movie
00:41:44.08 --> 00:41:49.08 But no one really understands the difficulty and the challenging and the self discipline
00:41:49.08 --> 00:41:52.08 It's an exercise to self self discipline to crawl
00:41:52.08 --> 00:42:05.08 You know one meter every 10 minutes it's hard to get to position where you can see your target take the shot because you have to yeah because you have to have the patience to and the mindset to like
00:42:07.08 --> 00:42:12.08 I don't know if it made it into the book. I can't I know you should know your own book, but I
00:42:12.08 --> 00:42:19.08 Remember as leopard crawling with a guy and we were on it wasn't even a sniper thing. It was just like a feel like a like a
00:42:19.08 --> 00:42:27.08 Field craft thing so we were learning how to just stalk just as soldiers and we were we were side by side, but he was literally on an elevation
00:42:27.08 --> 00:42:30.08 Maybe four inches higher than me
00:42:31.08 --> 00:42:35.08 I remember I was looking at him and I was like, I just that's not a good spot to be yes
00:42:36.08 --> 00:42:40.58 Freeze boom Walker came over God. I was it. I was in direct line of sight
00:42:41.08 --> 00:42:46.08 But I was just that four inches lower. You got to like have the patience to look at the ground and go
00:42:46.08 --> 00:42:51.08 I'm going to go this way even though it's out of your way because you can't be with insight of
00:42:52.08 --> 00:42:56.08 Of the spotters or of the enemy and that guy went on to become
00:42:57.08 --> 00:43:01.08 Our tier he joined our tier one unit. He's a he's a JTF guy
00:43:02.08 --> 00:43:10.08 But I remember at that time it's so it's not like he was a dummy area and and and we're might have learned a value of the lesson. He probably learned a lesson, but but that's the
00:43:10.08 --> 00:43:16.08 Mind said I'm looking for from day one from a guy that I'm going to put through sniper school because we don't we don't have a lot of numbers in Canada
00:43:17.08 --> 00:43:21.08 You know like I was telling you at any given time there might be a hundred and fifty maybe a hundred and eighty
00:43:22.08 --> 00:43:29.08 Snipers active at any time in the forces and that might and that you know if you add in our tier one tier two guys or maybe there's 200
00:43:30.08 --> 00:43:35.08 So I don't have time to to go looking for the best guys, you know
00:43:35.08 --> 00:43:41.08 You have to come you basically got to come to us and and so I'm looking for the patient
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:46.08 I'm looking for the guy who's going to take that extra five minutes and look at the ground
00:43:47.08 --> 00:43:53.08 He's who's not going to when I tell him okay, you can go go start stalking who's going to sit there for another five ten minutes lose that time
00:43:54.08 --> 00:43:56.08 But study the route on his map
00:43:56.08 --> 00:44:02.08 You know because it's easy to start run and then you go oh man, I shouldn't know where I'm going and
00:44:02.08 --> 00:44:05.08 No, no time spent on the map is time saved on the ground
00:44:06.08 --> 00:44:16.08 Right and you so you're looking for that guy and there's just it's a it's probably the same with seals you just you don't it's hard to describe but you know it when you see it
00:44:18.08 --> 00:44:20.08 So you get done with sniper school
00:44:21.08 --> 00:44:24.08 You spend some more time and then
00:44:25.08 --> 00:44:29.08 September 11 happens game on and
00:44:29.08 --> 00:44:32.08 And the opportunity comes up
00:44:33.08 --> 00:44:41.08 For you to go and deployment now you'd already been through sniper school you were a sniper, but the opportunity there's no opportunity for sniper deploy what they need is a driver
00:44:42.08 --> 00:44:44.08 right which
00:44:45.08 --> 00:44:46.08 A driver slash
00:44:47.08 --> 00:44:55.08 Security yeah, which is which is I mean it's definitely a dangerous job. It's definitely a monotonous job. It's not it's not a glorious job by any stretch
00:44:55.08 --> 00:45:01.08 But and also what's rough about being a drivers you have a lot less control over your own fate
00:45:02.08 --> 00:45:07.08 I mean you're basically in a defensive situation when you're driving in a convoy you're in defensive situation. That's all that is to it
00:45:08.08 --> 00:45:11.08 So here you are you get your target. Yeah, your target. You've been trained to be the hunter
00:45:12.08 --> 00:45:18.08 And now you get an offer to go on deployment to be the hunted base as a driver and of course because your
00:45:18.08 --> 00:45:25.08 A warrior you say oh, you need a driver. You don't need a sniper, but I'm going to go to Afghanistan
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:31.08 All right, bring it on. Yeah, that was it. It was stay home or be a driver
00:45:33.08 --> 00:45:41.08 Pretty easy. So get this pretty simple. So now you were trying what were these little deep you drive it out this so it's
00:45:41.08 --> 00:45:43.08 It's
00:45:43.08 --> 00:45:54.32 What do you guys got that's comparable nothing? Um, do you just like a little land rover type vehicle? Yeah, but it's like not even like it's it's it's almost a class of its own is it
00:45:55.08 --> 00:45:57.08 No, it's like a little
00:45:58.08 --> 00:46:04.08 Dune buggy looking thing it had like a four cylinder engine build originally by Volkswagen
00:46:04.08 --> 00:46:10.08 We they were roughly the same like look as a original willys Jeep
00:46:11.08 --> 00:46:18.08 But that's where the similarities ended and you get to Afghanistan and you're you're drive where are you?
00:46:19.08 --> 00:46:26.08 Kabul that was Kabul. And so you're driving people around the city. Yeah from base to wherever they got to go from the airport to our main base, which was
00:46:28.08 --> 00:46:30.08 Was the name of that camp again
00:46:30.08 --> 00:46:37.08 I'm sorry, I forget the main camp we had in Afghanistan, but it was between the King and Queen's palace got it and
00:46:39.08 --> 00:46:42.08 Yeah, they'd go there or because it was
00:46:43.08 --> 00:46:51.08 Officers and liaison officers mostly that we worked with right it so it'd be like goliies on with the Turkish guys goliies on with the Germans goliies on with this Afghan war lord
00:46:52.08 --> 00:46:57.08 You'd sit around ways. Yeah, yeah, basically and we'd be as bodyguards when he was there and stuff and
00:46:57.08 --> 00:47:07.08 And like we said there's a threat. You you obviously were prepared for anything of course, but you know, there wasn't a super high threat
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:10.08 Right, however
00:47:11.08 --> 00:47:15.08 There's always a threat and I'm going to the book here
00:47:17.08 --> 00:47:21.08 The eldest jeeps were not designed to withstand an attack
00:47:21.08 --> 00:47:29.08 This fact became starkly apparent when three three RCR guys were driving to Eltis and hit a land mine
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:37.08 Two of them sergeant Robert short and corporal Rob Beer and Fenger died immediately
00:47:38.08 --> 00:47:43.08 And the driver TJ Sterling a friend of mine survived though he was injured
00:47:44.08 --> 00:47:48.08 After the incident TJ was brought to the hospital at camp warehouse
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:51.08 And me and another one of the guys from the regiment went to see him
00:47:52.08 --> 00:47:55.08 This was the first time I'd seen one of our guys hit by a land mind
00:47:56.08 --> 00:48:00.08 In fact, it was the first time I'd seen a casualty at all
00:48:01.08 --> 00:48:06.08 TJ was pretty banged up a couple of teeth were broken and he may have had a broken draw
00:48:07.08 --> 00:48:09.08 He had laceration's all over
00:48:09.08 --> 00:48:14.08 There's always a particular odor in the hospitals around people of suffered traumatic injuries
00:48:14.08 --> 00:48:19.08 I remember smelling that odor like blood or maybe just what I thought blood smelled like
00:48:20.08 --> 00:48:22.08 TJ was on a stretcher with big wheels
00:48:23.08 --> 00:48:25.08 We'd use this kind of stretcher before in training
00:48:26.08 --> 00:48:29.08 To me it was a kind of prop
00:48:30.08 --> 00:48:32.08 This thing we used for simulations
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:35.08 But this was not a simulation
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:37.08 This was the real thing
00:48:38.08 --> 00:48:40.08 TJ was still in shock
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:44.08 It had taken a few hours for him to be extracted from the scene of the explosion
00:48:45.08 --> 00:48:49.08 Shorty and beer and Fenger are gone he said
00:48:50.08 --> 00:48:52.08 Yeah man, we replied, we heard
00:48:53.08 --> 00:48:56.08 I need a smoke man, I need a smoke TJ said
00:48:57.08 --> 00:49:00.08 The doctors and nurses wouldn't allow it but as soon as they were out of the vicinity
00:49:01.08 --> 00:49:03.08 We lit a cigarette for TJ and gave him a couple of drags
00:49:05.08 --> 00:49:07.08 That's way better thanks
00:49:07.08 --> 00:49:10.08 We stayed in Chadwick, TJ about some
00:49:11.08 --> 00:49:15.08 In consequential things trying to keep a fellow royal in a good state of mind
00:49:16.08 --> 00:49:19.08 For me personally, I was learning from what was happening
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:23.08 Facing the reality that when things go wrong
00:49:24.08 --> 00:49:26.08 You have to get that smell in your nostrils
00:49:27.08 --> 00:49:29.08 And look those sights right in the eye
00:49:30.08 --> 00:49:34.08 Sadly, a few years later, TJ ended up taking his own life
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:37.08 I was a Paul Barrett as funeral
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:41.08 And as I carried his coffin, I wondered if he carried guilt
00:49:42.08 --> 00:49:45.08 For being the lone survivor in that incident
00:49:45.08 --> 00:49:47.08 So really to me, that's like you're welcome to war
00:49:48.08 --> 00:49:49.08 Yeah
00:49:52.08 --> 00:49:53.08 And
00:49:54.08 --> 00:49:57.08 And
00:49:57.08 --> 00:50:04.08 Yeah
00:50:05.08 --> 00:50:09.08 When you talked about getting that smell in your nostrils
00:50:10.08 --> 00:50:12.08 And looking those sights right in the eyes
00:50:13.08 --> 00:50:15.08 That's how I think it's important for people to remember
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:18.08 You know when things are bad
00:50:19.08 --> 00:50:21.08 Some people want to deny that it's happening
00:50:21.08 --> 00:50:25.08 They want to hold their nose and shield their eyes from it
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:27.08 Wrong answer
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:29.08 Breathe it in
00:50:29.08 --> 00:50:31.08 Yeah, and our gig, especially
00:50:32.08 --> 00:50:33.08 Breathe it in
00:50:34.08 --> 00:50:35.08 You have to
00:50:36.08 --> 00:50:37.08 That
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:39.08 You have
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:42.08 And our line of work, that's the norm
00:50:43.08 --> 00:50:45.08 And I'll tell you, I haven't working with
00:50:46.08 --> 00:50:51.08 Worked with a bunch of different companies and bunch of different industries
00:50:51.08 --> 00:50:54.08 They run into these situations too
00:50:54.08 --> 00:50:56.08 Where their company is going to fail or there's a problem
00:50:57.08 --> 00:50:58.08 There's things go wrong
00:50:59.08 --> 00:51:00.08 And no, you know what?
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:03.08 Lives are not at stake and I say this all the time
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:04.08 But livelihoods are
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:06.08 And if you're the CEO of a company, you're going to have to now lay off
00:51:07.08 --> 00:51:09.08 500 people, 1000 people, 3 people
00:51:10.08 --> 00:51:13.08 And now that person is not going to be able to afford their mortgage or pay for their kids
00:51:13.08 --> 00:51:14.08 Or get food on the table
00:51:15.08 --> 00:51:16.08 That is serious business
00:51:16.08 --> 00:51:18.08 You're ruining someone's life
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:22.08 And if you want to shield your eyes at that moment
00:51:23.08 --> 00:51:26.08 And you want to hold your nose so you don't have to smell it, you're wrong
00:51:27.08 --> 00:51:28.08 Yeah
00:51:29.08 --> 00:51:32.08 And obviously this too here for TJ
00:51:36.08 --> 00:51:40.08 This is, you know, we're talking about the psychological wounds that people get
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:43.08 Yeah, which for him more worse than his physical wounds
00:51:43.08 --> 00:51:44.08 Yeah
00:51:44.08 --> 00:51:46.08 I remember one time after I got hit
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:49.08 Because he actually came back with us
00:51:50.08 --> 00:51:52.08 And it was six on the tour I was wounded on
00:51:53.08 --> 00:51:55.08 And he stayed in the talk the whole time
00:51:56.08 --> 00:51:59.08 But I remember we were back and I was hit
00:52:00.08 --> 00:52:02.08 And we were at his house and we're having a little bit of a party
00:52:03.08 --> 00:52:07.08 And he was crying because he couldn't believe that he, because he got
00:52:08.08 --> 00:52:11.08 He was wounded and he got a monthly stipend for his injuries
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:14.08 And he was still active doing and stuff
00:52:14.08 --> 00:52:19.08 And when I wound it we had a new veterans system come in
00:52:19.08 --> 00:52:21.08 Where I just got like a lump sum payment
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:25.08 And he was crying about how is it that he can get this money
00:52:26.08 --> 00:52:29.08 But I only get this money and Joey, what happened to you is so much worse
00:52:30.08 --> 00:52:33.08 And what happened to me and I was, why you worried about it
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:36.08 I'm okay man, I'm alive, we're here having some drinks
00:52:37.08 --> 00:52:41.08 But he was so tore up inside about what happened to me
00:52:41.08 --> 00:52:45.08 And he happened to me versus what happened to him, what happened to Shorty and Baron finger
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:48.08 And he just carried that
00:52:49.08 --> 00:52:52.08 And you hear about that survivor's guilt thing
00:52:53.08 --> 00:52:56.08 And you don't realize how real it is till you see it
00:52:57.08 --> 00:53:00.08 And even after I got wounded when I came home
00:53:01.08 --> 00:53:03.08 I felt like shit because my boys were still back there
00:53:04.08 --> 00:53:06.08 And then when they went back in 2010
00:53:07.08 --> 00:53:09.08 Because our unit rotated back into theater
00:53:09.08 --> 00:53:12.08 It killed me, I was dying inside
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:16.08 Those are my guys, you know, they're over there without me
00:53:17.08 --> 00:53:19.08 And I'm letting them down because I told them I was going back with them
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:22.08 I said don't worry guys, I'll get better I'll go back
00:53:23.08 --> 00:53:25.08 And I had to like really come to grips with that
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:28.08 And you know, TJ couldn't
00:53:30.08 --> 00:53:32.08 We lose too many guys that's to that stuff
00:53:33.08 --> 00:53:36.08 But I've all, I don't know, I never had those thoughts
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:39.08 But I never thought of ending my own life ever
00:53:40.08 --> 00:53:42.08 But I've known enough guys that have done it
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:46.08 That clearly it becomes an option to some people
00:53:47.08 --> 00:53:50.08 And I'm at the point with it because it just happened
00:53:51.08 --> 00:53:56.08 Maybe a month ago with a guy I worked with in the Green Braise
00:53:57.08 --> 00:54:00.08 And I just don't think we can save them all
00:54:00.08 --> 00:54:05.08 I don't know if any of you are guy, I mean I think I texted you when it happened
00:54:06.08 --> 00:54:07.08 You did, you texted me
00:54:08.08 --> 00:54:12.08 And I want to really, my wife, Alana, she's never seen me cry
00:54:13.08 --> 00:54:15.08 And I cried that night for Johnny
00:54:16.08 --> 00:54:19.08 And it was because we thought we had him
00:54:20.08 --> 00:54:23.08 He was living at one of the guys, how he said was on the team that we worked with
00:54:24.08 --> 00:54:27.08 He had a girlfriend and things were looking good
00:54:27.08 --> 00:54:31.08 And you know, I've had to come to the conclusion
00:54:32.08 --> 00:54:36.08 In my own mind that we're not going to save them all
00:54:37.08 --> 00:54:40.08 And this is a side effect of the life we chose
00:54:41.08 --> 00:54:43.08 That some of our comrades are going to go that direction
00:54:44.08 --> 00:54:47.08 And if I was to dwell on it the way TJ did
00:54:48.08 --> 00:54:50.08 Then I would become like TJ and I can't afford to do that
00:54:51.08 --> 00:54:53.08 You know, use the word Dwell
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:56.08 And that's a word that I use as well
00:54:57.08 --> 00:55:00.08 I use the word Dwell and I always say
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:03.08 That you got to face these things
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:06.08 You got to understand these things
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:08.08 You got to actually embrace these things
00:55:09.08 --> 00:55:11.08 You got to bring them in but you can't to well on them
00:55:12.08 --> 00:55:12.08 That's right
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:14.08 And I think that's the key
00:55:15.08 --> 00:55:18.08 Is to, is honestly to do what you said
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:20.08 Is to breathe it in
00:55:20.08 --> 00:55:22.08 So look it in the eye
00:55:23.08 --> 00:55:24.08 Deal with it
00:55:25.08 --> 00:55:26.08 Don't stay there
00:55:27.08 --> 00:55:28.08 That's right, move on
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:31.08 Accept it as a consequence of the actions you've chosen
00:55:32.08 --> 00:55:33.08 And move on to the next step
00:55:34.08 --> 00:55:36.08 Otherwise, you'll be that guy
00:55:37.08 --> 00:55:39.08 Talking about that high school football pass that you caught
00:55:40.08 --> 00:55:42.08 It's an analogy that fits here
00:55:43.08 --> 00:55:45.08 Because we talked about this in your car
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:46.08 There's some guys
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:50.08 I was a neighbor, I was a Navi seal, I was a paratrooper, I was a machine gunner
00:55:51.08 --> 00:55:54.08 Whatever it is, I was a jitsu black belt, whatever it is
00:55:55.08 --> 00:55:56.08 And that's where they're stuck
00:55:57.08 --> 00:55:59.08 That's where they're dwelling there in purgatory
00:56:00.08 --> 00:56:03.08 And that whatever ring of hell you want to call it
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:05.08 Stuck in that moment
00:56:06.08 --> 00:56:07.08 And you got to move on
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:10.08 You can't dwell because that's where you're going to die when you dwell
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:12.08 It really simply
00:56:13.08 --> 00:56:14.08 What you got to do
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:16.08 It's you got to just take a step
00:56:17.08 --> 00:56:19.08 Got to take that step forward
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:22.08 You got to look, you got to look it in the eyes
00:56:23.08 --> 00:56:25.08 Then you got to walk away
00:56:26.08 --> 00:56:28.08 And you got to walk forward and move forward
00:56:29.08 --> 00:56:31.08 And make some make go in another direction
00:56:32.08 --> 00:56:32.08 Go forward
00:56:33.08 --> 00:56:33.08 Yeah
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:35.08 Don't go backwards, go forward
00:56:36.08 --> 00:56:38.08 And the other part is accept
00:56:39.08 --> 00:56:41.08 That maybe you can't change things
00:56:41.08 --> 00:56:44.08 You can't change what's happened in the past
00:56:45.08 --> 00:56:46.08 You cannot do that
00:56:47.08 --> 00:56:48.08 It happened
00:56:49.08 --> 00:56:52.08 And you're not going to change it
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:54.08 So what are you going to do?
00:56:55.08 --> 00:56:56.08 Are you going to let it drag you down?
00:56:57.08 --> 00:56:58.08 Are you going to dwell on it forever?
00:56:59.08 --> 00:57:00.08 Don't do that
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:02.08 I know it gets a hold of you
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:04.08 I know it's a tough one
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:07.08 But deal with it
00:57:07.08 --> 00:57:10.08 Accept that you can't change it
00:57:11.08 --> 00:57:12.08 Accept that you're here for a reason
00:57:13.08 --> 00:57:14.08 To do something
00:57:15.08 --> 00:57:17.08 You have the opportunity that maybe your buddies didn't get
00:57:18.08 --> 00:57:19.08 They didn't get, never mind
00:57:20.08 --> 00:57:21.08 You have an opportunity that your buddies did not get
00:57:22.08 --> 00:57:26.08 You think they would want to have you kill yourself?
00:57:27.08 --> 00:57:29.08 No, they'd want you to live
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:32.08 But that's what you need to do
00:57:33.08 --> 00:57:35.08 Honor them
00:57:35.08 --> 00:57:39.08 By living a awesome life every day
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:41.08 Make the change, be the difference
00:57:42.08 --> 00:57:44.08 You can't change the world
00:57:45.08 --> 00:57:47.08 But you could change somebody else's day
00:57:48.08 --> 00:57:51.08 You can be the positive influence in your little tiny sphere
00:57:52.08 --> 00:57:55.08 My influence in the world, yours, echoes
00:57:56.08 --> 00:57:57.08 It's not the world
00:57:58.08 --> 00:57:59.08 But it makes someone else happy
00:58:00.08 --> 00:58:03.08 You can be the difference between a good day and a bad day for someone
00:58:03.08 --> 00:58:07.08 When I decided that I was going to try and become an officer in the sealed teams
00:58:08.08 --> 00:58:10.08 Part of that, part of my decision
00:58:11.08 --> 00:58:13.08 I was going to be an admiral or whatever
00:58:14.08 --> 00:58:16.08 And I said, you know what?
00:58:17.08 --> 00:58:19.08 Because I had a prior and listed officer that was just made our lives
00:58:20.08 --> 00:58:21.08 Awesome because he was such a great guy
00:58:22.08 --> 00:58:23.08 I said to myself, you know what?
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:25.08 I might not change the world
00:58:26.08 --> 00:58:28.08 But I'm going to have a cool sealed pool two in one day
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:30.08 Those guys are going to be fired up
00:58:30.08 --> 00:58:32.08 And we're going to kick ass
00:58:33.08 --> 00:58:34.08 Just my little world
00:58:35.08 --> 00:58:35.08 Just that little thing
00:58:36.08 --> 00:58:38.08 And no matter where you are, you got that little world
00:58:39.08 --> 00:58:40.08 Maybe like you said, maybe it's one of the person
00:58:41.08 --> 00:58:42.08 Maybe it's just yourself
00:58:43.08 --> 00:58:45.08 But you make that little part of your world a little bit better
00:58:46.08 --> 00:58:48.08 You wake up in the morning
00:58:49.08 --> 00:58:52.08 I firmly believe you decide how that day is going to go
00:58:53.08 --> 00:58:53.08 Absolutely
00:58:54.08 --> 00:58:57.08 I missed my flight to come down
00:58:57.08 --> 00:58:59.08 I should have been here yesterday, I missed my flight
00:59:00.08 --> 00:59:01.08 I owned that
00:59:02.08 --> 00:59:04.08 I had a bad morning
00:59:05.08 --> 00:59:07.08 And I was, I think I was even on the phone with you
00:59:08.08 --> 00:59:09.08 And I said, yeah, extreme ownership
00:59:10.08 --> 00:59:11.08 My fault
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:15.08 And you giggled at me and you said, yep, own it, whatever
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:21.08 And then I might get my one assistant called me
00:59:22.08 --> 00:59:23.08 And I said, you know what?
00:59:24.08 --> 00:59:25.08 I'm done being pissed off
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:29.08 You know, because I can't, I'm not going to let this one thing ruin the rest of my day
00:59:30.08 --> 00:59:30.08 And the rest of my weekend
00:59:31.08 --> 00:59:32.08 How's that helping you move forward?
00:59:33.08 --> 00:59:34.08 How's that helping the rest of your day?
00:59:35.08 --> 00:59:35.08 How's that helping you get here right now?
00:59:36.08 --> 00:59:36.08 Doesn't help anything
00:59:37.08 --> 00:59:39.08 That doesn't mean that doesn't mean be a robot either though
00:59:40.08 --> 00:59:40.08 No
00:59:41.08 --> 00:59:42.08 Deal with it, process it
00:59:43.08 --> 00:59:43.08 Don't get me wrong
00:59:44.08 --> 00:59:45.08 I was really mad yesterday morning
00:59:46.08 --> 00:59:47.08 And it takes a lot
00:59:48.08 --> 00:59:49.08 He's waiting for you down here
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:53.08 Oh, well, I'm like, I've all the things to be laid for
00:59:53.08 --> 00:59:56.08 Yeah, that's right, a guy like, you want a guy like Jocco to think you're a shit
00:59:57.08 --> 00:59:58.08 You know, you're plug and can't make a timing
00:59:59.08 --> 01:00:00.08 But
01:00:01.08 --> 01:00:03.08 You know, everything's gonna be okay
01:00:04.08 --> 01:00:06.08 I'm here, we're still doing the podcast
01:00:07.08 --> 01:00:08.08 It's beautiful weather
01:00:09.08 --> 01:00:10.08 I got to see my kids, I got to pick them up from school
01:00:11.08 --> 01:00:12.08 Because I didn't think I was gonna
01:00:13.08 --> 01:00:15.08 I got to, you know, I got to see some friends
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:16.08 Walk the dogs that day
01:00:17.08 --> 01:00:19.08 But I made that decision myself though
01:00:20.08 --> 01:00:21.08 I was sitting on the edge of the bed
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:23.08 I didn't have my prosthetically exon yet
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:26.08 And I said, okay, you're pissed off, now you're done
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:29.08 And I got up and I carried on with the day because
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:33.08 And I, okay, it's easy to say
01:00:35.08 --> 01:00:36.08 What's easy for us to say
01:00:37.08 --> 01:00:39.08 Take that step, don't dwell, move on
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.08 But I firmly believe if you decide
01:00:44.08 --> 01:00:47.08 You can change your circumstance
01:00:48.08 --> 01:00:49.08 That's a decision you have to make in your own mind
01:00:49.08 --> 01:00:51.08 I firmly believe it
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:53.08 And it might not feel like it today
01:00:54.08 --> 01:00:55.08 But try again tomorrow
01:00:56.08 --> 01:00:57.08 And then try again the next day
01:00:58.08 --> 01:00:59.08 And you know what call me
01:01:00.08 --> 01:01:02.08 Before you make any decisions
01:01:03.08 --> 01:01:04.08 Just please just call me first
01:01:05.08 --> 01:01:07.08 If you have Jocco's number call him
01:01:08.08 --> 01:01:11.08 Because the world is definitely better with you here
01:01:12.08 --> 01:01:13.08 Than without you
01:01:14.08 --> 01:01:16.08 And I hate to keep hammering this nail
01:01:16.08 --> 01:01:20.08 But it's just a theme that I'm tired of here
01:01:21.08 --> 01:01:23.08 A buddy of mine, another sniper had a heart attack
01:01:24.08 --> 01:01:26.08 Not long after
01:01:27.08 --> 01:01:28.08 That guy killed himself
01:01:29.08 --> 01:01:31.08 He's a great dude, he's a legend in the Canadian sniper world
01:01:32.08 --> 01:01:35.08 And he was diabetic and he smoked a thousand cigarettes a day
01:01:36.08 --> 01:01:37.08 And drank a million beers a week
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:41.08 And they said the heart attack was so fast
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:43.08 He probably was because they found him in bed
01:01:43.08 --> 01:01:45.08 He was crawling into bed and probably went
01:01:46.08 --> 01:01:47.08 And it was dead before he just had even hit the pillow
01:01:48.08 --> 01:01:49.08 That's how massive a heart attack it was
01:01:50.08 --> 01:01:52.08 When I heard it was a heart attack, I was actually happy
01:01:53.08 --> 01:01:55.08 Because when I heard it, I went
01:01:56.08 --> 01:01:57.08 I just went shootin with him
01:01:58.08 --> 01:01:58.08 He was in a great mood
01:01:59.08 --> 01:02:00.08 Oh no no no no no no no it was a heart attack
01:02:01.08 --> 01:02:01.08 And I went, oh thank God
01:02:02.08 --> 01:02:04.08 That's the point of that
01:02:04.08 --> 01:02:05.08 With that subject
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:06.08 So anyway
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:07.08 Let's move on man
01:02:08.08 --> 01:02:09.08 It's talk about puppy dogs and rainbows
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:10.08 Okay, we're not there yet
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:11.08 No no no no no no
01:02:12.08 --> 01:02:14.08 I was a good reference you know miss my flight good
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:17.08 I can bring my kids to school
01:02:17.08 --> 01:02:19.08 You know all this good they can't run
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:23.08 So, I would like to go rainbows
01:02:23.08 --> 01:02:24.08 But we're not there yet
01:02:24.08 --> 01:02:25.08 All right brother, hit me
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:27.08 So now you're
01:02:28.08 --> 01:02:30.08 You're coming back for Afghanistan
01:02:31.08 --> 01:02:33.08 And you know you got your girlfriend and what not
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:35.08 And
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:37.08 Here we go
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:40.08 My first tour in Afghanistan ended a few weeks later
01:02:41.08 --> 01:02:42.08 And I headed back home
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:45.08 I was still haunted
01:02:46.08 --> 01:02:48.08 By all the things I had witnessed in Kabul
01:02:49.08 --> 01:02:50.08 Images played over and over in my head
01:02:51.08 --> 01:02:52.08 Whether it was small children begging for money
01:02:53.08 --> 01:02:55.08 A mother holding a dead baby in the streets
01:02:56.08 --> 01:02:58.08 Or my buddy TJ bloodied up from a roadside bombing
01:02:59.08 --> 01:03:02.08 My girlfriend expected me to return as the same guy
01:03:03.08 --> 01:03:04.08 Who had left six months earlier
01:03:04.08 --> 01:03:07.08 When I was a different man now a different jodie
01:03:08.08 --> 01:03:11.08 Everything around me looked different too
01:03:12.08 --> 01:03:13.08 Maybe things hadn't changed much
01:03:14.08 --> 01:03:17.08 But I felt like I was on an alien planet
01:03:18.08 --> 01:03:20.08 My girlfriend had redecorated the house
01:03:21.08 --> 01:03:22.08 Moving some of the furniture around and re-paining the bedroom
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:24.08 And I found it upset me
01:03:25.08 --> 01:03:27.08 Life had gone on without me
01:03:28.08 --> 01:03:29.08 And that fact was hard to take
01:03:30.08 --> 01:03:31.08 People around me kept saying
01:03:31.08 --> 01:03:33.08 What's wrong with you jodie? You've changed
01:03:34.08 --> 01:03:36.08 And that would make me even more upset
01:03:37.08 --> 01:03:39.08 Not because they were wrong
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:44.08 But because I thought I was the kind of soldier who could just walk it off
01:03:46.08 --> 01:03:48.08 But few soldiers can
01:03:49.08 --> 01:03:52.08 It takes time after a tour duty for a soldier to readjust a civilian life
01:03:53.08 --> 01:03:54.08 And I wish I'd known that earlier
01:03:55.08 --> 01:03:58.08 I was expected to continue life just as I had lived
01:03:58.08 --> 01:04:00.08 It before my tour but I couldn't
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:02.08 Not right away
01:04:03.08 --> 01:04:04.08 I couldn't step back into my normal routine
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:07.08 As if I hadn't witnessed anything on mission
01:04:08.08 --> 01:04:12.08 I couldn't just hop in the car and go to the grocery shopping
01:04:13.08 --> 01:04:14.08 Like everything was fine
01:04:19.08 --> 01:04:21.08 It's interesting that you kind of felt like
01:04:21.08 --> 01:04:27.08 You were weak sauce because you were not the exact same before you went on to point it
01:04:28.08 --> 01:04:29.08 Yeah, you feel like I'm pussy
01:04:31.08 --> 01:04:33.08 Even though you know you shouldn't feel like a pussy
01:04:34.08 --> 01:04:35.08 You feel like a pussy
01:04:37.08 --> 01:04:39.08 It's the most frustrating
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:42.08 At the time it was one of the most frustrating things
01:04:43.08 --> 01:04:47.08 Because you want to be that guy for your for your for your woman
01:04:47.08 --> 01:04:51.08 Of course, I'm still that awesome alpha male that you fell in love with
01:04:52.08 --> 01:04:55.08 You couldn't whatever doesn't you know doesn't blink anything
01:04:56.08 --> 01:04:58.08 Except that water bottle inside the road right there
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:00.08 What's that pile of garbage doing right there?
01:05:01.08 --> 01:05:06.08 What do you mean I should just drive? Oh right. Yeah, this is our street. Sorry. It's not a road and cool
01:05:08.08 --> 01:05:10.08 And and
01:05:10.08 --> 01:05:12.08 Yeah, I just
01:05:14.08 --> 01:05:15.08 I
01:05:16.08 --> 01:05:18.08 Like I said I wish I'd had that advice that
01:05:19.08 --> 01:05:23.08 You know be prepared for the fact because when I went to Kosovo
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:28.08 Because I've had that people ask me will you you didn't have that reaction when you came out from Kosovo
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:30.08 Why lived in the barracks?
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:35.08 All my shit was in storage. I didn't have a girlfriend. I had a girl that I was dating. She picked me up
01:05:35.08 --> 01:05:39.08 When we got home, but like it's not like we were gonna get engaged or anything
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:42.08 And you know, I didn't have any real belongings
01:05:43.08 --> 01:05:46.08 You know, I you know, I still lived at the unit. This was a house I had bought
01:05:47.08 --> 01:05:51.08 You know, my girlfriend had moved in, you know, she was talking about kids and marriage
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:53.08 And we had dog. We had a dog
01:05:54.08 --> 01:05:59.08 And I came home and I was like what happened to my house and what is going on and like
01:05:59.08 --> 01:06:04.08 You know, what I told my dad when I went to Kosovo
01:06:05.08 --> 01:06:10.08 You know, in the book I taught what my dad one of the three times I've seen him cry in my life
01:06:11.08 --> 01:06:15.08 Was when I deployed to Kosovo for the first time and and I said hey man, don't worry about it six months
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:20.08 Hey, what's six months, right? It's like six haircuts, six six six mortgage payments
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:22.08 It's nothing, don't worry about it
01:06:23.08 --> 01:06:25.08 And I come home and I couldn't even think that way myself
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:30.08 And you know, and I know I don't know if you felt like that after your first deployment
01:06:31.08 --> 01:06:36.08 But this one was different because I guess I had a life to come home to beside besides the unit
01:06:37.08 --> 01:06:40.08 I've always been very compartmentalized in the way I think
01:06:41.08 --> 01:06:44.08 Right, sometimes probably to a detriment to
01:06:45.08 --> 01:06:47.08 My family a little bit
01:06:48.08 --> 01:06:52.08 But I've always been very far from the work come home. I'm not I'm not working anymore
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:55.08 So just stop thinking about that stuff
01:06:56.08 --> 01:07:07.08 And it's it's usually pretty positive but the problem is that when you get to you realize your compartmentalizing your family out of the picture kind of which I would have a tendency to do so what
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:13.08 And I mean that's probably part of one of the things that but even even when you're a real young guy
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:17.08 Like how long have you been married?
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:19.08 I've been married for a long time
01:07:19.08 --> 01:07:29.08 Okay, and and I've always been like that. Okay. I honestly it's wrong. I think but the seal teams was always the biggest priority in my life
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:32.08 And you know people will be like oh family first
01:07:33.08 --> 01:07:40.08 That was not true for me and luckily my wife understood that and she didn't hold it against me right
01:07:41.08 --> 01:07:44.08 She knew that someday she knew the seal team was wasn't gonna last forever
01:07:44.08 --> 01:07:49.08 And all you guys in the military I'll tell you what the military does not last forever
01:07:50.08 --> 01:07:57.08 Well the big green machine rolls on yeah, with or without you exactly and and the people that are there when you when you fall off
01:07:58.08 --> 01:08:01.08 Those are ones you gotta worry about when you're still on yep
01:08:01.08 --> 01:08:13.08 And so that's why I think I just was able to compartmentalize what you know away right and I would basically be almost a skits of front of this is a guy that works
01:08:14.08 --> 01:08:23.08 And this is a guy that's at home. He's dad or whatever and boom. I just have that really good split and I think it was beneficial to me
01:08:23.08 --> 01:08:37.08 It probably was probably is yeah, yeah, I guess I assumed I was that guy too because that's I you know I approached most things that way but
01:08:38.08 --> 01:08:46.08 Maybe just having that little home of my own for that one tour and then also you know losing a couple buddies for the first time
01:08:46.08 --> 01:08:55.08 Maybe I don't know I don't know what the thing like it's not like it didn't wreck anything like my career was fine like it was just well, I mean I lost a fiance out of it
01:08:56.08 --> 01:09:04.08 But yeah, yeah, and that's what happens next so she announced this is back to the book here she announced that she was leaving
01:09:05.08 --> 01:09:09.08 I was shocked because I didn't want to break things off. I just wanted to postpone the wedding
01:09:10.08 --> 01:09:12.08 But for her this was all too much
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:19.08 Our relationship was over while I was certain this was the right time to get well, I wasn't certain this was the right time to get married
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:22.08 I was certain about one thing
01:09:23.08 --> 01:09:28.08 I wanted to go back to Afghanistan in this time as a sniper
01:09:29.08 --> 01:09:31.08 And that's something that
01:09:33.08 --> 01:09:39.08 Yeah, I mean that's something that's hard to reconcile the feeling of
01:09:39.08 --> 01:09:45.08 Just want to go back. I mean that's I want to go back right now. Yeah, of course
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:51.08 People, hey, yeah, what's it like you you asked me what's it like to be in politics? I go I'd rather be killing ISIS
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:57.08 Yeah, frankly, and I you know, I'm not ashamed to say it. I was good at it and and I love
01:09:58.08 --> 01:10:04.08 The people that are out there doing it for us, you know, even though I'm not one of them anymore. You know what and
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:12.08 What we kind of skipped over but 9 11 happened during my sniper course and sniper course is we don't just have a rotation
01:10:13.08 --> 01:10:16.08 I'm going on in Canada. We're very small military if you're on a sniper course
01:10:17.08 --> 01:10:22.08 Holy shit like you've got you got there. They run like a one or two years something maybe
01:10:23.08 --> 01:10:27.08 There's not even every year. No, well, they're now I think it is but back then
01:10:27.08 --> 01:10:33.08 Mine was the first one in three years that had happened 25 of us tried out three of us passed
01:10:34.08 --> 01:10:37.08 So it's not like you get on it and it's okay. You just got a pass
01:10:38.08 --> 01:10:43.08 So but 9 11 happened on like day five or six or something and you know
01:10:44.08 --> 01:10:48.08 As the towers fell we watched it fall on TV like they interrupted a class
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:54.08 We thought it was like a sesna right the guy comes so much as a little plane of the world trades in it
01:10:54.08 --> 01:10:56.08 We're in the middle of a you don't interrupt a class
01:10:56.08 --> 01:10:59.08 You know right you don't interrupt a training session
01:11:00.08 --> 01:11:03.08 We're like okay man, thanks and the duty sergeant runs off
01:11:04.08 --> 01:11:10.08 But we think a drunk guy in a sesna and then he comes back and then so we go down to watch at the duty station and
01:11:11.08 --> 01:11:14.84 As it as the towers are falling. I'm hearing like the starting bell
01:11:14.84 --> 01:11:22.84 Right, I'm hearing like the horn at the start of the super bull and I'm like oh, it's on because I was considering retiring because of the lack of action
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:28.84 So you did get your
01:11:30.84 --> 01:11:37.84 I hate to call it a dream but you got your dream like I'm back to Afghanistan. Oh, yeah, and this time you're going as a sniper
01:11:37.84 --> 01:11:45.84 Which is awesome you're back in Afghanistan and there's some heavy fighting going on now. There's some legit fighting and and
01:11:47.84 --> 01:11:53.84 The Canadians are actually leading operations which is the first time in quite some time. I think since Korea
01:11:54.84 --> 01:11:59.84 Yeah, well this this what what we what we were we this was the first time we'd let operations
01:12:00.84 --> 01:12:02.84 That were non peacekeeping
01:12:03.84 --> 01:12:04.84 Ever
01:12:04.84 --> 01:12:10.84 Since Korea yeah, you're right and this but we what we walked into was the first offensive and NATO's history
01:12:12.84 --> 01:12:13.84 Ever
01:12:13.84 --> 01:12:20.84 Think about it right NATO has never been on the offensive except for enough Afghanistan kind of weird but North Atlantic treaty organization
01:12:21.84 --> 01:12:23.84 But anyway, this one was called operation Medusa
01:12:25.84 --> 01:12:30.84 This Canadian led up NATO operation was going to be different from anything we'd done so far
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:38.84 It was a bit of a wake-up call so was the fact that my buddy Jeff Walsh had been killed in friendly fire in an accident that happened in August
01:12:39.84 --> 01:12:43.84 Clearly we were entering a high risk situation
01:12:43.84 --> 01:12:52.84 That didn't determine any way in any way if anything it made my resolve stronger. I trained for this and I was ready
01:12:53.84 --> 01:12:55.84 It's a good feeling
01:12:55.84 --> 01:13:00.84 What what was the friendly fire was an aircraft or was it shooting?
01:13:00.84 --> 01:13:05.84 No this one was unfortunately it was his buddy in the vehicle. They were sitting next to each other and
01:13:09.84 --> 01:13:11.84 I guess
01:13:11.84 --> 01:13:13.84 He got in with his rifle
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:15.84 Not paying attention to the muzzle
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:20.84 And it went off and shot Jeff through the face and killed him
01:13:20.84 --> 01:13:28.84 That no one really knows exactly what happened but that's basically pretty much what everyone figures happened
01:13:31.84 --> 01:13:33.84 Muzzle discipline
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:37.84 Never point your weapon it's something you do not want to destroy
01:13:37.84 --> 01:13:41.84 Yeah, keep your finger off the trigger, keep your weapon on safe
01:13:44.84 --> 01:13:48.84 All right, now as you guys are getting ready to go into this operation Medusa
01:13:48.84 --> 01:13:54.84 One of the orders that comes out is if anybody gets hurt during this mission
01:13:54.84 --> 01:13:56.84 We're going to stop right away and take care of it
01:13:57.84 --> 01:14:02.84 And you're going to make sure the casualties are dealt with and then reassess the situation before moving forward
01:14:04.84 --> 01:14:05.84 That was during the
01:14:06.84 --> 01:14:09.84 The company commanders orders right and you were kind of thinking
01:14:09.84 --> 01:14:12.84 Wait a second. Yeah, for those of you that don't know
01:14:12.84 --> 01:14:24.84 Which is I'm sure people that aren't the military when you're going on in attack you're your ideas to maintain the momentum of the attack and you take casualties along the way while you're attacking
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:26.84 You keep attacking
01:14:26.84 --> 01:14:31.84 Yeah, you don't stop you know you're going to take casualties. You're going to keep people going to get hit things are going to slow you down
01:14:31.84 --> 01:14:35.84 You don't slow down. You try and keep pushing forward. Keep pushing forward
01:14:35.84 --> 01:14:41.84 I've said it on this podcast before aggression will mitigate risk
01:14:42.84 --> 01:14:47.84 So you get aggressive you move through the target you get the target secure and then you can deal with the guys that are down
01:14:47.84 --> 01:14:49.84 Yeah, not that you're going to
01:14:49.84 --> 01:14:53.84 Ignore them and you can't drop off a medic here and there to handle a situation
01:14:53.84 --> 01:14:56.84 But you're not going to stop. I mean literally you know stop
01:14:56.84 --> 01:15:00.84 No, you can't stop the whole battle group you can't stop
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:06.84 But you know though I don't know if the order was delivered the way it was intended
01:15:06.84 --> 01:15:10.84 But that's how it that's basically what that's to paraphrase what was said
01:15:10.84 --> 01:15:15.84 Yeah, and that's why you know a couple of us were just kind of like yeah, and what's really what's really
01:15:15.84 --> 01:15:23.84 To your point of you're not sure if that's what was meant what's really important is that the main thing you want to get across to your troops
01:15:23.84 --> 01:15:27.84 When you're going on to assault is you want the main point to be get aggressive
01:15:27.84 --> 01:15:33.84 That's the main point that you want to get across to them not hey the main point that you're going to take away from this is if we take casually stop
01:15:33.84 --> 01:15:35.84 You know
01:15:35.84 --> 01:15:42.84 We're going to get aggressive. We're going to finish through the target. We're going to secure the target and nothing is going to stop us from doing that
01:15:42.84 --> 01:15:48.84 I don't care what happens. That's what you want to have going into it. Right. That's that's my that was always my impression
01:15:48.84 --> 01:15:56.84 I've never been a company commander though, but you've received plenty of orders. Yes, sir. All right
01:15:57.84 --> 01:15:59.84 Now
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:03.84 We're starting it on the assault the assault is going down
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:08.84 And here we go up ahead the first vehicles were closing in on the white schoolhouse
01:16:08.84 --> 01:16:16.84 The Zettelmired cleared away for the lead between comprising of four lat LAVs and a G wagon to take position next to the schoolhouse
01:16:16.84 --> 01:16:22.84 It was at this point that the Taliban decided to make their presence known by firing an anti tank
01:16:22.84 --> 01:16:26.84 Recorulus rifle round at the softest vehicle of this lead platoon the G wagon
01:16:26.84 --> 01:16:31.84 The round went right through the front windshield causing immediate casualties
01:16:31.84 --> 01:16:36.84 Next our whole soul opened up all at once every can and every coaxial machine gun was firing
01:16:36.84 --> 01:16:40.84 Taliban were coming out of the weeds all around us out of tunnels windows mouse holes
01:16:40.84 --> 01:16:45.84 They had their head and they had to held their powder to the last second
01:16:45.84 --> 01:16:50.84 And then it was game on they had the defenders advantage and they used it
01:16:50.84 --> 01:16:55.84 The call went out on the radio that one of our vehicles was hit and we had casualties
01:16:55.84 --> 01:17:04.84 As this was happening one of the LAVs that was stuck next to the schoolhouse went nose first into a ditch and was stuck
01:17:04.84 --> 01:17:10.84 I was trying to listen on the radio when suddenly the troops who were sticking out of the top hatches of our LAV yelled
01:17:10.84 --> 01:17:16.84 Holy fuck they're right there. They let go of burst from their C7s followed by grenade from a rifle mounted grenade launcher
01:17:16.84 --> 01:17:22.84 At that moment our artillery began raining down and air support started dropping bombs on the Taliban
01:17:22.84 --> 01:17:32.84 I felt helpless during all this chaos because the plan for us as snipers was to get involved only one subjective rugby had been achieved
01:17:32.84 --> 01:17:37.84 At that point we would get up on the schools roof and provide cover for the bound to the next objective
01:17:37.84 --> 01:17:46.84 But in this situation Barry cash those are your sniper teammates Barry cash and I were stuck inside the LAV right at the time
01:17:46.84 --> 01:17:50.84 When our shooting skills were needed up top needed most up top
01:17:50.84 --> 01:17:56.84 I was working the radio doing my best to keep everyone in the vehicle informed of what was happening up ahead
01:17:56.84 --> 01:18:01.84 Okay, we've got three wounded in action and one killed in action
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:07.84 I said relaying the message that there were three wounded soldiers and one who was killed in the G-wagon that had been hit
01:18:07.84 --> 01:18:14.84 Every soldier had a zap number which would be used as an identifier in case you were wounded or killed in the field
01:18:14.84 --> 01:18:21.84 Standard operating procedure was that if someone died in combat you never revealed their name during the battle
01:18:21.84 --> 01:18:26.84 At this point we didn't know which soldier had been killed in that attack on the G-wagon
01:18:26.84 --> 01:18:29.84 And no one seemed to know the zap number either
01:18:29.84 --> 01:18:36.84 Finally the major got on the radio I need to know now who the fuck just got killed
01:18:36.84 --> 01:18:40.84 The radio crackled and a voice came on
01:18:40.84 --> 01:18:49.84 It was worn off Sir Rick Nolan sir Rick Nolan was the soldier I had had a brief argument with the day before
01:18:49.84 --> 01:18:53.84 I've always felt bad that our last conversation was a little strained
01:18:53.84 --> 01:18:59.84 Rick was a good man and a great soldier sitting in the front seat of that G-wagon
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:02.84 He had no chance of surviving a direct rocket hit
01:19:02.84 --> 01:19:07.84 I looked at Barry and Cash we were all stunned in the silence
01:19:07.84 --> 01:19:12.84 No matter how much you prepare for that moment when a soldier you know becomes a casualty
01:19:12.84 --> 01:19:15.84 There's nothing that compares to the actual feeling
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:22.84 On top of that it was jarring for all of us because we just didn't expect a soldier with his level of experience
01:19:22.84 --> 01:19:25.84 And status to be the first one taking out on the mission
01:19:34.84 --> 01:19:37.84 That section right there
01:19:39.84 --> 01:19:42.84 Reminding me we were I had guys out
01:19:42.84 --> 01:19:47.84 They were clearing the sector of Ramadi
01:19:47.84 --> 01:19:53.84 And big gunfight broke out and I don't know three or four hundred meters away
01:19:53.84 --> 01:19:57.84 Maybe five hundred meters away whatever it was
01:19:57.84 --> 01:20:00.84 I can just hear gunfire mayhem
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:05.84 Radeos I got up to a rooftop and I'm
01:20:06.84 --> 01:20:11.84 You know hey what's up and I hear the the element commander got on the radio
01:20:11.84 --> 01:20:16.84 And he says hey we're in a cash lead evacuation we got one killed and one wounded
01:20:16.84 --> 01:20:18.84 And
01:20:20.84 --> 01:20:26.84 They were with I don't know probably twenty Iraqi soldiers and five or six seals
01:20:28.84 --> 01:20:31.84 But you don't know who it is right and some waiting
01:20:31.84 --> 01:20:36.84 And you don't want to say anything on the radio and I'm waiting and I and
01:20:36.84 --> 01:20:44.84 Finally I just said is it I rack your American is like the longest
01:20:44.84 --> 01:20:51.84 Pause I've ever heard of my life and he comes back and he says both Iraqi and he was like they know
01:20:51.84 --> 01:20:56.84 Faced the Iraqi but to the Iraqi soldiers but you know I was
01:20:56.84 --> 01:21:01.84 Relieved very relieved at that point and you talk about that too and hear how
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:07.84 Somebody gets hurt or somebody gets wounded or somebody gets killed and you you know it's one of your guys
01:21:07.84 --> 01:21:14.84 And you feel guilty when you hear the name and it's not whatever one of your what are your better friends or whatever
01:21:14.84 --> 01:21:19.84 And that's one of those strange and freaking horrible things about war yeah
01:21:23.84 --> 01:21:25.84 You guys were I
01:21:26.84 --> 01:21:30.84 Mean this was like a shit sandwich out of the gate yeah
01:21:30.84 --> 01:21:39.84 Yeah, it you got to remember this is the first time Canada's been on the offensive since Korea and
01:21:39.84 --> 01:21:41.84 Doesn't matter how much you train
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:48.84 The first few minutes are going to be sloppy until you get your shit together
01:21:48.84 --> 01:21:56.84 Well, I shouldn't have even said shit same which I should have said this is combat that's it because I mean it's going
01:21:56.84 --> 01:22:01.84 It's going to you going to there you're setting up your positions you're moving into position
01:22:01.84 --> 01:22:06.84 The enemy hadn't really revealed himself as you said in the book they held their powder
01:22:06.84 --> 01:22:10.84 Yeah, well, we we wondered if they were there at all because the day before
01:22:11.84 --> 01:22:15.84 We watched as they all drove out of the area fighting aged guys
01:22:16.84 --> 01:22:22.84 Just drove away in trucks trucks full they left some guys behind they actually
01:22:22.84 --> 01:22:33.84 You know the average Taliban guy, you know, you don't even have the duck if you shoot now. You're really I mean you should duck but the point is he's probably not going to hit you, but they whoever they left behind
01:22:34.84 --> 01:22:39.84 Were guys that knew what the wood knew what they were out knew what they were doing and I give them credit for that like
01:22:40.84 --> 01:22:45.84 You know they're not soldiers as we consider it, but they're tough guys
01:22:45.84 --> 01:22:56.84 You know and you guys you sniper team you guys didn't even have your body armor. Yeah, well, because it's because it's part of the you know
01:22:56.84 --> 01:23:03.84 What's the three rules of special ops, right? Always look cool always know who you are and if you don't know where you are make sure you look cool
01:23:03.84 --> 01:23:11.84 Right, so wearing ball caps and not having body armor makes you look cool, but also in our minds and we trained
01:23:11.84 --> 01:23:21.84 We have enough shit to dump you know why add body armor to it and and helmets, you know, we're going to be in a position. We shouldn't if we're being engaged we fucked up
01:23:22.84 --> 01:23:30.84 But I tell you we I don't know if you're going to read it, but there's a there's a few moment few minutes later, I'm like I really wish I had some body armor
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:35.84 Oh no, I'm not going to read it, but I asked why I brought it up and I was actually I was actually not going to bring it up
01:23:35.84 --> 01:23:47.84 But then I circled to bring it up, you know why because there's somebody out there that's in the field right now that's going on some operation and they're thinking you know what I probably better off if I didn't bring my body armor and I'm going to tell you
01:23:47.84 --> 01:23:56.84 Bring your body armor, yeah, bring your body armor. I did want the operation that for a bunch of reasons
01:23:56.84 --> 01:24:11.84 I decided that I didn't need body armor, right, and of course ended up in a bad scenario and the only thing I'm thinking as I have as I'm have a gun pointed out my chest is
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:22.84 You're an idiot. Yeah, and you don't have body armor on. We had we had the strike plate. Oh, front of our chest rig, but we found out after
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:32.84 If we'd ever been struck in that plate, the spall from the plate would have killed us because it's designed to be inside the body armor, the the Kevler
01:24:32.84 --> 01:24:38.84 Because it had a Kevler wrap around it around the around the ceramic turns out it's not
01:24:38.84 --> 01:24:50.84 That wrap is there more just for aesthetics or something. I don't know but anyway, so it's like oh, no, no, it has to be inside the issued vest in order for it to work a pocket in your chest rig
01:24:50.84 --> 01:24:57.84 Yeah, no, that's not the other crazy thing again for guys that are overseas right now even if you think you're going to be far enough away from a
01:24:57.84 --> 01:25:08.84 Firefight if you could hit with an ID you want your body armor on 100% 100% I always wear my body armor in a vehicle. Yeah after this but
01:25:08.84 --> 01:25:16.84 But even the night I was hit I didn't have body armor on yeah, I don't always just a weird thing for me, but
01:25:16.84 --> 01:25:25.84 You know, they're the Romans and Irna the Greeks the Romans they called it, you know, the first time you see combat, you know, see in the elephant
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:36.84 So you know, we, so let's go back to Rick so Rick is a war officer, so do you guys maybe a pedi officer chief pedi officer
01:25:36.84 --> 01:25:44.84 Roughly he's like a company he was a company quartermaster, so he's not sergeant major, but he's like the next NCO down
01:25:44.84 --> 01:25:56.84 I'm going to guess he had about 18 20 years he would he had been a recon guy most of it, you know, I trained under him mentor to under him you know, it's like
01:25:56.84 --> 01:26:03.84 When you when you imagine casualties you're imagining private Smith and Corporal Jones and you know whoever
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:10.84 But our first guy killed is a guy who trained his whole life for war, and he's the first guy gone
01:26:10.84 --> 01:26:22.84 You know, like there's no there's no status there's no seniority in combat. No it doesn't care if you've trained every day for 100 years or if you've trained one day forever
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:26.84 That bullet is if it's got your name on it's got your name on it
01:26:26.84 --> 01:26:37.84 I was going to say bullets don't even have names on them. Yeah, they're going to hit yeah, and that's why combat is so that's one of the things about combat that makes it so
01:26:37.84 --> 01:26:44.34 So damn awful is like you said you can train as hard as you can train you can make no mistakes
01:26:44.34 --> 01:26:53.34 You can be the perfect warrior on the perfect mission and you can still get blown up. You can still get shot. There's nothing you can do about it
01:26:53.34 --> 01:27:01.84 Yeah, I mean I hate to say there's nothing you can do about it. You're getting in you're going to be trading lead with other people and
01:27:01.84 --> 01:27:11.84 That bullet can hit you and even if there are if they are dirt farmers with with 30 year old AKs if it's functioning. It's a threat and you know
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:17.84 I've had chats with guys about why was why was that vehicle even on the objective?
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:26.64 When you had these perfectly good armored vehicles now these are up armored jeeps the these these the gee it's there. They're the German one right
01:27:26.64 --> 01:27:35.64 We'd only train to this point right and and in training that vehicle went to the objective
01:27:35.64 --> 01:27:42.64 So why wouldn't it? You know until until someone puts a recoil is rifle round through it and you go
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:50.64 Might be best to leave that one behind and maybe just get another lab for the for the company quartermaster which after that they did
01:27:50.64 --> 01:27:52.64 But you know some lessons have to be learned
01:27:52.64 --> 01:27:57.64 But so the mayhem continues
01:27:57.64 --> 01:28:00.64 You end up helping
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:02.64 Collect the casualties yeah
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:08.64 And now you're sitting there you're at them when we would call a casually collection point. Do you use that term?
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:16.64 Yeah, I don't know if you use that in here. CCP. So you're at the CCP the casualty collection point and here you go
01:28:16.64 --> 01:28:24.64 One of the most important things in the field of battle is taking care of your dead in fact the creative of the royals is never leave a royal behind
01:28:24.64 --> 01:28:34.64 On the field you want to get the bodies out of sight as quickly as possible. It's demoralizing for a soldier to witness a dead comrade during battle, especially when it's someone of Rick stature
01:28:34.64 --> 01:28:42.64 I went in the back of an LAV grabbed a couple of body bags and got to work with some of our other guys
01:28:42.64 --> 01:28:46.64 We picked up Rick and zipped him into a bag
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:50.64 One of the other fallen officers was Frank Mellish
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:56.64 For a second I had a bit of hope because he was on a stretcher which meant he might have only been wounded
01:28:56.64 --> 01:29:00.64 But once I saw soldiers approach and check his dog tags
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:05.64 I knew he was gone a casualty of the round that took out the zettle mire
01:29:05.64 --> 01:29:13.64 The sad twist was that Frank Mellish and Rick know it had been friends for their whole careers and now they were lying on the ground together
01:29:13.64 --> 01:29:19.64 Next I help put private William Cushley into a bag
01:29:19.64 --> 01:29:25.64 I'll never forget looking directly into his still open eyes and saying sorry bro
01:29:25.64 --> 01:29:37.64 As I zipped up his body bag
01:29:37.64 --> 01:29:41.64 Now that's obviously enough to crush
01:29:41.64 --> 01:29:47.64 Some people mentally and emotionally at that point
01:29:47.64 --> 01:29:57.64 But soldiers don't have time
01:29:57.64 --> 01:30:01.64 They have to do their jobs
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:03.64 What?
01:30:03.64 --> 01:30:07.64 As you went through that emotion
01:30:07.64 --> 01:30:11.64 And then you turn around and you go, okay?
01:30:11.64 --> 01:30:12.64 What's next?
01:30:12.64 --> 01:30:13.64 Yep
01:30:13.64 --> 01:30:15.64 How's that work?
01:30:15.64 --> 01:30:19.64 That's what you do
01:30:19.64 --> 01:30:25.64 If I had spent more than that when second say in sorry bro, what am I missing?
01:30:25.64 --> 01:30:31.64 I was doing, I couldn't get my snipers into a position to be useful
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:35.64 Being snipers so we were being useful in other ways
01:30:35.64 --> 01:30:43.64 And once that problem was dealt with because you could see the guy, like you know we were trying to reorganize ourselves here
01:30:43.64 --> 01:30:45.64 And the re-org phase
01:30:45.64 --> 01:30:50.64 The guys are going the long way around of the vehicle because they were lined up next to the vehicle
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:53.64 And so me and a couple of guys are like, okay, we got to fix this
01:30:53.64 --> 01:30:59.64 We fixed it and people you felt, you felt people relaxed
01:30:59.64 --> 01:31:05.64 And then my main concern was that's still our objective
01:31:05.64 --> 01:31:08.64 And we got to get to it so what's next?
01:31:08.64 --> 01:31:12.64 And that's when I went looking for like I'm not even sure who's in charge at this point
01:31:12.64 --> 01:31:14.64 Because we had taken so much of our leadership
01:31:14.64 --> 01:31:18.64 It'd been hurt the company's sergeant major to the warrants
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:25.64 You know, when that Zettelmeyer got hit, you know, it wounded a bunch of guys
01:31:25.64 --> 01:31:30.64 And you know we had Afghans with us, we had some Americans with us
01:31:30.64 --> 01:31:33.64 What do you call the National Guard?
01:31:33.64 --> 01:31:37.64 I think the National Guard mentors for the Afghans are with us
01:31:37.64 --> 01:31:43.64 And my biggest disappointment from that day
01:31:43.64 --> 01:31:48.64 And I know I'm going to catch some, I might catch some shit from some guys that were there
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:51.64 We didn't take our objective
01:31:51.64 --> 01:31:53.64 To this day
01:31:53.64 --> 01:31:59.64 You know what, 2016, you know, it's just 10 years later
01:31:59.64 --> 01:32:02.64 Almost, it's a 10 or a little bit 10 years
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:06.64 And to this day, I'm like, we didn't take our objective
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:10.64 Yeah
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:17.64 In part of that, you know, and for one thing, when I, when I, you know, was reading that
01:32:17.64 --> 01:32:22.64 And I mean obviously it's just emotional moment
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:24.64 And I knew that you just had to detach from the emotion
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:26.64 And I used that term all the time
01:32:26.64 --> 01:32:28.64 Yeah, you got to just detach from it
01:32:28.64 --> 01:32:30.64 And you got to be conscious of that
01:32:30.64 --> 01:32:32.64 So like, folks that are listening
01:32:32.64 --> 01:32:34.64 That are thinking how do you do that? That's how you do it
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:38.64 But you cannot, you've got, when you feel the emotion starting to override
01:32:38.64 --> 01:32:42.64 Your logic and your ability to do your duty
01:32:42.64 --> 01:32:44.64 That's what you have to do, you have to go, okay
01:32:44.64 --> 01:32:48.64 I got to detach from those emotions and I got to do my job now
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:49.64 Yeah
01:32:49.64 --> 01:32:52.64 In that moment, like, I actually don't remember
01:32:52.64 --> 01:32:55.64 Like I didn't really have any feelings
01:32:55.64 --> 01:32:58.64 You know, I get more feeling now out of it
01:32:58.64 --> 01:32:59.64 Listening to you read it
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:00.64 Yeah
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:01.64 Because that
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:06.64 Starting with, especially when TJ got, got hurt, you know
01:33:06.64 --> 01:33:08.64 That's our workspace
01:33:08.64 --> 01:33:09.64 Yeah
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:11.64 Like, you know, here we're in an office
01:33:11.64 --> 01:33:15.64 Yeah, you can, people typing, doors opening, closing
01:33:15.64 --> 01:33:19.64 That's the normal sound and vibe of this workspace
01:33:19.64 --> 01:33:27.64 We had burning vehicles, we had dead soldiers, we had wounded soldiers, we had about 15 wounded by this point
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:34.64 We had air support raining in, we had artillery support raining in, we had enemy mortars coming down
01:33:34.64 --> 01:33:37.64 And you know, that's the norm
01:33:37.64 --> 01:33:43.64 They don't like, when you sign up to be a Navy seal, they don't hide the fact that you might get gunfights
01:33:43.64 --> 01:33:46.64 It's like the first thing you read, it's in big, bold black letters
01:33:46.64 --> 01:33:48.64 You're gonna, you could get killed
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:54.64 It's not in the small print at the bottom of the contract, you know, claws, B of Section 4
01:33:54.64 --> 01:33:55.64 It's right there
01:33:55.64 --> 01:33:57.64 That's what you signed up for
01:33:57.64 --> 01:33:59.64 So
01:33:59.64 --> 01:34:03.64 It's not abnormal for these things to be happening
01:34:03.64 --> 01:34:09.64 What you have to do is accept that they happened and carry on with the job
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:18.64 And in that moment, I remember, I said, sorry bro, because I was, I was, I was actually probably felt more like, hey man, sorry you're out of the game
01:34:18.64 --> 01:34:21.64 Because it's gonna get exciting from here
01:34:21.64 --> 01:34:30.64 You know, I, oh, a fallen soldier in combat to me is, especially a volunteer
01:34:30.64 --> 01:34:33.64 We weren't drafted, did anyone make you join the Navy?
01:34:33.64 --> 01:34:34.64 No
01:34:34.64 --> 01:34:38.64 I, I fought with my parents to get into the Army
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:46.64 I, I would have, I would have, fist, I would have fought ten of my best friends to get that job as that sniper team leader
01:34:46.64 --> 01:34:54.64 And there is nowhere else I wanted to be and if soldier falling in combat doing the job he chose and a, and a play
01:34:54.64 --> 01:34:56.64 It's not of our choosing
01:34:56.64 --> 01:35:01.64 Don't ever feel sorry for me, because I went to Afghanistan, believe me, I wanted to be there
01:35:01.64 --> 01:35:04.64 And for, and to fall
01:35:04.64 --> 01:35:11.64 I get in a lot of shit by some people, but that's, it's one of the greatest things a soldier can do
01:35:11.64 --> 01:35:18.64 Is the fall for it with his friends doing the job that he chose or she chose
01:35:18.64 --> 01:35:25.64 And it's, I, I get in shit sometime because I think like this
01:35:25.64 --> 01:35:30.64 Well, it's, I think the reason that is is because it's so hard for people that
01:35:30.64 --> 01:35:34.64 Don't know what that brotherhood is like
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:37.64 They don't know what it's like to want to do that
01:35:37.64 --> 01:35:42.64 They don't understand that that's
01:35:42.64 --> 01:35:46.64 That's the soldier in the child, that's the way you've wanted to be your whole life
01:35:46.64 --> 01:35:50.64 That's the way I want to be my whole life so to, for these things to happen is
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:57.64 It's like feeling bad for an MMA fighter because they got punched in the face
01:35:57.64 --> 01:35:59.64 There you go for it
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:02.64 You signed up for it and those guys, you know, they're there to fight
01:36:02.64 --> 01:36:08.64 And the military, you're there to fight and a byproduct of fighting in this situation
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:11.64 Can be injury, it can be death
01:36:11.64 --> 01:36:15.64 And like you said, it's what we all signed up for
01:36:15.64 --> 01:36:20.64 And you know, going back to the situation here
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:26.64 One of the things that you talked about the fact that you guys didn't secure your objective
01:36:26.64 --> 01:36:30.64 And one of the reasons that you didn't secure your objective the next day
01:36:30.64 --> 01:36:33.64 is because you had another friendly fire incident
01:36:33.64 --> 01:36:37.64 And this is awful and you know, the book that I wrote with
01:36:37.64 --> 01:36:42.64 Dave starts off with a friendly fire scenario happening
01:36:42.64 --> 01:36:45.64 And I wish I could explain to civilians
01:36:45.64 --> 01:36:48.64 It's really hard for people to understand how these things happened
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:50.64 I mean we've already talked about it
01:36:50.64 --> 01:36:53.64 What two times in this book here's another one
01:36:53.64 --> 01:36:55.64 ATEN's come in
01:36:55.64 --> 01:37:00.64 You're basically like half awake trying to get trying to get a little bit of sleep
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:01.64 Yeah
01:37:01.64 --> 01:37:04.64 And all of a sudden you know you hear the gun fire, you hear things happening
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:07.64 All of a sudden you hear an ATEN burst go
01:37:07.64 --> 01:37:12.64 And cash, you're your teammate cash
01:37:12.64 --> 01:37:14.64 He's like, you're not going to believe this
01:37:14.64 --> 01:37:17.64 But I think he just strafed our own guys
01:37:17.64 --> 01:37:20.64 Strafed is when you fire machine gun can
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:23.64 And fire fire from an aircraft
01:37:23.64 --> 01:37:30.64 And sure enough 30 soldiers more than 30 soldiers were injured
01:37:30.64 --> 01:37:31.64 Yeah
01:37:31.64 --> 01:37:35.64 And one was killed and by the way the one that was killed was private mark
01:37:35.64 --> 01:37:40.64 Graham who was a Olympic spreader for Canada 1992 and Barcelona
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:41.64 Yeah
01:37:45.64 --> 01:37:47.64 I mean it's a nightmare
01:37:47.64 --> 01:37:49.64 It was a nightmare
01:37:49.64 --> 01:37:51.64 It was
01:37:51.64 --> 01:37:54.64 Such a I even got mad at cash at first
01:37:54.64 --> 01:37:58.64 Because I was like because I heard it and you know that breath
01:37:58.64 --> 01:38:01.64 It's actually a nice feeling
01:38:01.64 --> 01:38:03.64 And till that happens
01:38:03.64 --> 01:38:05.64 And that one sounded weird
01:38:05.64 --> 01:38:07.64 Because I got his half awake
01:38:07.64 --> 01:38:10.64 And they were doing strafing runs across
01:38:10.64 --> 01:38:13.64 Because we were on each side of the Argonne Dobrever
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:16.64 So there's a bit of distance
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:19.64 And that one was like that was real close
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:22.64 That's kind of weird and I'm trying to just wake up
01:38:22.64 --> 01:38:25.64 And cash is yeah they hit the hit us
01:38:25.64 --> 01:38:27.64 I go what the what are you talking about
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:30.64 Why would he and I look down from our sniper position
01:38:30.64 --> 01:38:35.64 To where the vehicles were and that's what exactly what it happened
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:38.64 And on my mind I know what an A10 strike does
01:38:38.64 --> 01:38:41.64 I'm like oh my god he killed all my friends
01:38:41.64 --> 01:38:46.64 And then through the dust and so right away
01:38:46.64 --> 01:38:48.64 I'm like okay well if I'm the enemy I know what I would do
01:38:48.64 --> 01:38:52.64 You know sound the bugles boys were attacking
01:38:52.64 --> 01:38:55.64 They didn't do that
01:38:55.64 --> 01:39:00.64 My theory is they had already left after the gun fight the day before
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:04.64 And so we reorientate all our focus to the front
01:39:04.64 --> 01:39:07.64 To keep an eye on the enemy and I can't help but look down
01:39:07.64 --> 01:39:12.64 We had a JTF sniper team directly to our left
01:39:12.64 --> 01:39:16.64 And they left their spotters in place
01:39:16.64 --> 01:39:19.64 And they rest on the rest of them ran down with their medical kids
01:39:19.64 --> 01:39:23.64 And when they were walking away
01:39:23.64 --> 01:39:27.64 Eventually the team you know four guys walk away with a body bag
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:30.64 And I'm like oh okay that's it
01:39:30.64 --> 01:39:33.64 And then the you know the radio
01:39:33.64 --> 01:39:36.64 You know then that's like yeah we're 10 10 wounded
01:39:36.64 --> 01:39:39.64 Okay to 12 okay 17 is 21
01:39:39.64 --> 01:39:42.64 And then I think we ended up at about 34 35
01:39:42.64 --> 01:39:46.64 So the entire leadership of the company's wiped out
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:48.64 And with injury
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:53.64 And that's it that company is now combat and effect
01:39:53.64 --> 01:39:54.64 Yeah, which is
01:39:54.64 --> 01:39:57.64 I mean to hear that in the modern day
01:39:57.64 --> 01:40:00.64 You don't hear that very often combat and effect
01:40:00.64 --> 01:40:02.64 I mean that they can no longer perform their duties
01:40:02.64 --> 01:40:03.64 Yeah, they just don't hear that
01:40:03.64 --> 01:40:05.64 They just don't have enough bodies left
01:40:05.64 --> 01:40:07.64 Like they just didn't have enough soldiers that were still functioning
01:40:07.64 --> 01:40:14.64 And you know we went to Afghanistan in 2002
01:40:14.64 --> 01:40:18.64 With op was an anaconda I believe
01:40:18.64 --> 01:40:29.64 We sent a battalion of Canadian soldiers with and that's where the Canadian snipers set the new record
01:40:29.64 --> 01:40:33.64 Beatying Carlos half cocks that had stood since Vietnam
01:40:33.64 --> 01:40:38.64 But part of that mission was we lost four guys to an American F-16
01:40:38.64 --> 01:40:46.64 And then this happened and people give a lot of shit to the American Air Force or aircraft
01:40:46.64 --> 01:40:49.64 Mistakes happen
01:40:49.64 --> 01:40:53.64 We almost got lit up by our own guys at the beginning of the assault
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:54.64 You know we didn't talk about it
01:40:54.64 --> 01:40:58.64 But I had to radio and remind them hey guys we're coming in from your flank
01:40:58.64 --> 01:41:01.64 You've looked through thermal I've looked through thermal
01:41:01.64 --> 01:41:05.64 The guys like us look anything like bad guys looking in through thermal
01:41:05.64 --> 01:41:07.64 I don't know how it happens
01:41:07.64 --> 01:41:10.64 Yeah, but guys get so amped up and they're so ready to kill something
01:41:10.64 --> 01:41:12.64 You just don't want it to be you
01:41:12.64 --> 01:41:15.64 Hey in Ramadi there was incidents where
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:18.64 Humvees engaged other humvees
01:41:18.64 --> 01:41:19.64 Right?
01:41:19.64 --> 01:41:21.64 Because the enemy has no more
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:23.64 Does he look like anything like a humvee
01:41:23.64 --> 01:41:25.64 No more distinct event in the world in a humvee
01:41:25.64 --> 01:41:27.64 Yeah, especially when you're in the military
01:41:27.64 --> 01:41:34.64 And but that's to your point that's the level of confusion and mayhem and chaos that happens
01:41:34.64 --> 01:41:40.64 And just the mentality of guys when they're scared and all of a sudden they see muzzle flash
01:41:40.64 --> 01:41:44.64 And okay, you know what boom oh I see something over there engaged
01:41:44.64 --> 01:41:48.64 Everything looks like a shovel and someone's hand looks like an AK
01:41:48.64 --> 01:41:54.64 So I don't lay any blame on the American pilot that did this
01:41:54.64 --> 01:42:01.64 He was doing the job he was there to do and someone told him to do something
01:42:01.64 --> 01:42:07.64 And they he cut off the wrong puff of smoke and that's what happened
01:42:07.64 --> 01:42:11.64 You know it was just a literally it was one of those
01:42:11.64 --> 01:42:16.64 It was one of those each little action led to it
01:42:16.64 --> 01:42:19.64 Right, you know from mark lighting the garbage fire
01:42:19.64 --> 01:42:26.64 To to him coming over the mountain and the and the sun is in his eyes
01:42:26.64 --> 01:42:28.64 Amen
01:42:28.64 --> 01:42:31.64 Shit happened a bunch of small mistakes that compound
01:42:31.64 --> 01:42:35.64 And I even mistakes just just such situational actions
01:42:35.64 --> 01:42:39.64 Yeah, that compound and two a tragic situation
01:42:39.64 --> 01:42:44.64 But I when you consider what a strafing run from an eight ten can do
01:42:44.64 --> 01:42:48.64 For us to only have one killed is amazing is incredible
01:42:48.64 --> 01:42:53.64 And and and only you know of those thirty something wounded
01:42:53.64 --> 01:42:55.64 I might not have the right number
01:42:55.64 --> 01:42:57.64 But if I understand correctly
01:42:57.64 --> 01:43:01.64 Maybe it doesn't have to retire due to their injuries
01:43:01.64 --> 01:43:03.64 Maybe
01:43:03.64 --> 01:43:04.64 Crazy
01:43:04.64 --> 01:43:05.64 Yeah
01:43:05.64 --> 01:43:10.64 So you guys continue doing sniper operations
01:43:10.64 --> 01:43:13.64 You guys continue
01:43:13.64 --> 01:43:16.64 Going on missions you support SF you support others
01:43:16.64 --> 01:43:22.64 Lots of really solid missions and now you're out on another operation
01:43:22.64 --> 01:43:27.64 You're patrolling through a village
01:43:27.64 --> 01:43:32.64 And again it's your team that you've been with the whole time
01:43:32.64 --> 01:43:36.64 You're following cash your boy cash
01:43:36.64 --> 01:43:39.64 And I'm going to go to the book here
01:43:39.64 --> 01:43:42.64 Once he was about ten meters ahead
01:43:42.64 --> 01:43:47.64 I turned and took my first step forward
01:43:47.64 --> 01:43:50.64 My right foot touched the ground
01:43:50.64 --> 01:43:55.64 And a massive orange fireball soared across my face
01:43:55.64 --> 01:43:57.64 I didn't hear a sound
01:43:57.64 --> 01:44:03.64 For a few seconds I felt waitless as if I was suspended in space
01:44:03.64 --> 01:44:06.64 The next thing I knew I was on the ground
01:44:06.64 --> 01:44:11.64 My ears nose and mouth tasted like mud
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:13.64 And that's when the pain hit
01:44:13.64 --> 01:44:18.64 A pain so intense that it completely overwhelmed my body and my silence
01:44:18.64 --> 01:44:20.64 I started punching the ground and screaming
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:24.64 Oh my god, oh my god it was the only time in my life
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:27.64 I've ever uttered anything religious
01:44:27.64 --> 01:44:31.64 The blast was so powerful that he had knocked cash down
01:44:31.64 --> 01:44:34.64 And I saw him in the dirt up ahead of me
01:44:34.64 --> 01:44:37.64 For a few seconds I couldn't see barrier guard
01:44:37.64 --> 01:44:41.64 They had probably done what good snipers are supposed to do upon hearing the explosion
01:44:41.64 --> 01:44:44.64 Run for cover and prepare for an ambush
01:44:44.64 --> 01:44:48.64 A few seconds later once they realized what had happened
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:50.64 They came running back towards me
01:44:50.64 --> 01:44:55.64 So there it is
01:44:55.64 --> 01:44:59.64 Did you know what did you know was an ID?
01:44:59.64 --> 01:45:08.64 Not why
01:45:08.64 --> 01:45:12.64 Could have been RPG, could have been someone there for those of you that don't know
01:45:12.64 --> 01:45:15.64 You don't know big booms are going off
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:17.64 I didn't hear anything
01:45:17.64 --> 01:45:19.64 Right like I said like
01:45:19.64 --> 01:45:23.64 You're not going to hear the one that gets you from in my case it was real
01:45:23.64 --> 01:45:26.64 But my hearing was fine, there's no ringing
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:31.64 There is no and I've read Colonel
01:45:31.64 --> 01:45:33.64 Help me out he wrote it on killing
01:45:33.64 --> 01:45:34.64 Oh yeah, yeah
01:45:34.64 --> 01:45:35.64 Yeah
01:45:35.64 --> 01:45:39.64 Anyway, so I know your name I just forget it right now
01:45:39.64 --> 01:45:42.64 And he talks about that in his other book on combat
01:45:42.64 --> 01:45:43.64 Yeah, the little audible
01:45:43.64 --> 01:45:45.64 The body will shut it off
01:45:45.64 --> 01:45:46.64 And it's split second
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:48.64 But anyway
01:45:48.64 --> 01:45:50.64 I knew I'd done something
01:45:50.64 --> 01:45:52.64 Something bad it happened
01:45:52.64 --> 01:45:57.64 Once I you know my weapon was gone, you know my night vision is gone
01:45:57.64 --> 01:45:58.64 Right
01:45:58.64 --> 01:46:00.64 And the pain was so bad
01:46:00.64 --> 01:46:04.64 And you know it technically was an ID though
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:07.64 Under the technical definition right because it was a
01:46:07.64 --> 01:46:10.64 An any personal landmine on top of a mortar bottle
01:46:10.64 --> 01:46:12.64 Technically
01:46:12.64 --> 01:46:14.64 We you and I know that's an ID
01:46:14.64 --> 01:46:18.64 But it's really two conventional munitions put together
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:21.64 And it did exactly what it was supposed to do
01:46:21.64 --> 01:46:23.64 You know
01:46:23.64 --> 01:46:28.64 It just it's one of those
01:46:28.64 --> 01:46:36.64 It's one of those things of war where there's no rhyme or reason about who's going to get wet or when or where
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:38.64 Because everyone else in your patrol just walked over it
01:46:38.64 --> 01:46:39.64 I was last guy
01:46:39.64 --> 01:46:44.64 I remember the first time I was ever shot
01:46:44.64 --> 01:46:48.64 I was in homebees and I'm going over a bridge and back dad
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:52.64 And again this is going back to what you were talking about
01:46:52.64 --> 01:46:55.64 Like when you don't really know what's combat's like
01:46:55.64 --> 01:46:58.64 And I'm looking up ahead of me at the home via
01:46:58.64 --> 01:47:02.64 And I see these like someone's throwing cigarettes
01:47:02.64 --> 01:47:03.64 Out the window
01:47:03.64 --> 01:47:04.64 I go
01:47:04.64 --> 01:47:06.64 Who the hell is smoking
01:47:06.64 --> 01:47:07.64 We don't even have any smoke
01:47:07.64 --> 01:47:10.64 Like who's smoking right and how are they smoking at thousands of cigarettes
01:47:10.64 --> 01:47:12.64 I think they're smoking so many cigarettes right now
01:47:12.64 --> 01:47:13.64 And then why are they smoke
01:47:13.64 --> 01:47:17.64 Who why are these things sparking when they hit the the ground over there
01:47:17.64 --> 01:47:18.64 And why is there sparks
01:47:18.64 --> 01:47:19.64 Oh
01:47:19.64 --> 01:47:20.64 Okay
01:47:20.64 --> 01:47:21.64 Newsflas
01:47:21.64 --> 01:47:22.64 We're getting shot
01:47:22.64 --> 01:47:23.64 We're under effective fire
01:47:23.64 --> 01:47:24.64 Yeah
01:47:24.64 --> 01:47:26.64 And it's one of those things
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:31.64 But my point is that you don't always know what's happening
01:47:31.64 --> 01:47:33.64 And you know in the urban environment
01:47:33.64 --> 01:47:35.64 You didn't know where shots were coming for you
01:47:35.64 --> 01:47:37.64 You're like rounds to be going overhead
01:47:37.64 --> 01:47:39.64 You could not tell where they were coming from
01:47:39.64 --> 01:47:41.64 You know if they're hitting something you can kind of get a general idea
01:47:41.64 --> 01:47:43.64 But you don't always know what's happening
01:47:43.64 --> 01:47:48.64 And all right so now going back to the book here
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:51.64 My mates were all around me now
01:47:51.64 --> 01:47:56.64 The next hour was the longest of my life
01:47:56.64 --> 01:47:58.64 I was an absolute aggrst agony
01:47:58.64 --> 01:48:00.64 And trying hard to stay positive
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:04.64 I was also trying hard not to think about the possibility
01:48:04.64 --> 01:48:06.64 Of bleeding out
01:48:06.64 --> 01:48:10.64 With each passing minute I was going weaker and weaker
01:48:10.64 --> 01:48:13.64 Every time I closed my eyes it was harder to open them again
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:15.64 I knew that if I lost consciousness
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:17.64 It was over
01:48:17.64 --> 01:48:19.64 Baring gold we're standing over me
01:48:19.64 --> 01:48:22.64 Do you think I'm going to make it
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:24.64 I asked Gord
01:48:24.64 --> 01:48:26.64 Of course you're going to make it
01:48:26.64 --> 01:48:28.64 Never give up bro
01:48:28.64 --> 01:48:30.64 You know that
01:48:30.64 --> 01:48:32.64 You know that
01:48:38.64 --> 01:48:41.64 And you guys hadn't been to T-Triple C
01:48:41.64 --> 01:48:42.64 None of us
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:45.64 So for those of you don't know there's something called T-Triple C
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:47.64 Tactical combat casualty care
01:48:47.64 --> 01:48:49.64 It's a very short course
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:51.64 That's like maybe a week
01:48:51.64 --> 01:48:54.64 It's two days maybe three days
01:48:54.64 --> 01:48:58.64 Because all the T-TU is how to keep somebody alive
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:00.64 When this stuff happens
01:49:00.64 --> 01:49:01.64 That's what the goal is
01:49:01.64 --> 01:49:03.64 And it doesn't take a super amount of knowledge
01:49:03.64 --> 01:49:06.64 It takes some concepts
01:49:06.64 --> 01:49:08.64 Number one stop the bleeding
01:49:08.64 --> 01:49:11.64 But none of your guys had been to it
01:49:11.64 --> 01:49:13.64 But they still saved your life
01:49:13.64 --> 01:49:17.64 I mean between Barry Gord and I
01:49:17.64 --> 01:49:20.64 You know like we're all experienced operate
01:49:20.64 --> 01:49:23.64 And we still have enough first aid training
01:49:23.64 --> 01:49:26.64 You know the first thing they did is slap the Ternic it's on
01:49:26.64 --> 01:49:28.64 There you go
01:49:28.64 --> 01:49:30.64 At the arteries and my thighs
01:49:30.64 --> 01:49:33.64 And then they did their best from there
01:49:33.64 --> 01:49:35.64 And we're snipers
01:49:35.64 --> 01:49:36.64 We're not medics
01:49:36.64 --> 01:49:39.64 And we don't bring as awesome as medics are
01:49:39.64 --> 01:49:41.64 They're kind of in the way
01:49:41.64 --> 01:49:43.64 When you're on a sneaky sneaky mission
01:49:43.64 --> 01:49:44.64 That was what we
01:49:44.64 --> 01:49:46.64 That's how we classified our missions
01:49:46.64 --> 01:49:47.64 If they were sneaky sneaky
01:49:47.64 --> 01:49:49.64 Or it's really sneaky sneaky
01:49:49.64 --> 01:49:51.64 If we're really sneaky sneaky
01:49:51.64 --> 01:49:53.64 What's almost going to have bad day
01:49:53.64 --> 01:49:57.64 And this one was a middle sneaky and we were in a spot
01:49:57.64 --> 01:49:59.64 Where there is no Aussie
01:49:59.64 --> 01:50:01.64 You're not getting a vehicle in there
01:50:01.64 --> 01:50:05.64 You know and the closest medic was
01:50:05.64 --> 01:50:09.64 12, 1500 meters away on foot
01:50:09.64 --> 01:50:12.64 At night through an Afghan village
01:50:12.64 --> 01:50:14.64 Hours
01:50:14.64 --> 01:50:15.64 Took him an hour
01:50:15.64 --> 01:50:17.64 The wrecky platoon
01:50:17.64 --> 01:50:18.64 Just thrown on this out there
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:19.64 They just gave
01:50:19.64 --> 01:50:20.64 They just didn't even wait for it
01:50:20.64 --> 01:50:21.64 They were just coming
01:50:21.64 --> 01:50:23.64 I love those guys
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:24.64 That's why that's why
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:25.64 You I had to say
01:50:25.64 --> 01:50:26.64 I love those guys
01:50:26.64 --> 01:50:28.64 I everyone of them that listens
01:50:28.64 --> 01:50:30.64 I love those guys
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:31.64 100%
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:33.64 I do anything for them
01:50:33.64 --> 01:50:35.64 So
01:50:35.64 --> 01:50:38.64 They get you
01:50:38.64 --> 01:50:39.64 They do get you out
01:50:39.64 --> 01:50:40.64 Yep
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:41.64 They
01:50:41.64 --> 01:50:43.64 They put the phone in your hand
01:50:43.64 --> 01:50:45.64 Before you go into surgery
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:46.64 Right
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:47.64 So we're back in Canada
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:51.64 I heard at the hospital and someone hands me a phone
01:50:51.64 --> 01:50:53.64 And
01:50:53.64 --> 01:50:55.64 I forget how it even went
01:50:55.64 --> 01:50:57.64 Like I was on a lot of drugs by this point
01:50:57.64 --> 01:50:59.64 One thing about getting wounded is
01:50:59.64 --> 01:51:01.64 Get to a lot of good drugs
01:51:01.64 --> 01:51:03.64 Here's what you told you dad
01:51:03.64 --> 01:51:04.64 They got me dad
01:51:04.64 --> 01:51:05.64 The towel band
01:51:05.64 --> 01:51:07.64 But I'm alive
01:51:07.64 --> 01:51:08.64 Going into surgery
01:51:08.64 --> 01:51:10.64 I'm going to get through this
01:51:10.64 --> 01:51:11.64 Don't worry
01:51:11.64 --> 01:51:14.64 I can't
01:51:14.64 --> 01:51:16.64 I kind of want to compliment you right now
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:19.64 Because you always hear
01:51:19.64 --> 01:51:21.64 Of and of
01:51:21.64 --> 01:51:22.64 Do you speak compliment
01:51:22.64 --> 01:51:24.64 Like all my buddies
01:51:24.64 --> 01:51:26.64 Anybody that knows
01:51:26.64 --> 01:51:27.64 They got wounded
01:51:27.64 --> 01:51:28.64 They're like hey don't worry about it
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:29.64 I would be okay
01:51:29.64 --> 01:51:30.64 Yeah
01:51:30.64 --> 01:51:32.64 And
01:51:32.64 --> 01:51:34.64 At the same time
01:51:34.64 --> 01:51:37.64 You called your dad like dad of wound
01:51:37.64 --> 01:51:38.64 You don't go to the surgery
01:51:38.64 --> 01:51:39.64 Don't worry about it
01:51:39.64 --> 01:51:40.64 Yeah
01:51:40.64 --> 01:51:41.64 You know
01:51:41.64 --> 01:51:43.64 That's probably actually
01:51:43.64 --> 01:51:45.64 What's funny is a mic monster
01:51:45.64 --> 01:51:48.64 Who is one of my guys got killed in
01:51:48.64 --> 01:51:49.64 Ramadi and
01:51:49.64 --> 01:51:51.64 I mean they were in
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:54.64 Grueling
01:51:54.64 --> 01:51:56.64 Sustained
01:51:56.64 --> 01:51:58.64 Combat every single day
01:51:58.64 --> 01:51:59.64 Firefights
01:51:59.64 --> 01:52:01.64 I mean he went winchester
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:02.64 On his
01:52:02.64 --> 01:52:04.64 On his heavy machine gun
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:07.64 So many times that I don't even know
01:52:07.64 --> 01:52:08.64 Like one time
01:52:08.64 --> 01:52:10.64 I was went to visit him
01:52:10.64 --> 01:52:11.64 In their camp
01:52:11.64 --> 01:52:12.64 Because I was on the other side
01:52:12.64 --> 01:52:14.64 Winchester means completely at a ammo
01:52:14.64 --> 01:52:15.64 Oh yeah
01:52:15.64 --> 01:52:15.64 Sorry
01:52:15.64 --> 01:52:16.64 Winchester means you're out of ammo
01:52:16.64 --> 01:52:17.64 So I went to see
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:18.64 I went to his camp
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:19.64 Pretty early in deployment
01:52:19.64 --> 01:52:20.64 Maybe
01:52:20.64 --> 01:52:22.64 Three or four weeks in deployment
01:52:22.64 --> 01:52:23.64 And I went over to their camp
01:52:23.64 --> 01:52:25.64 To see how things were going
01:52:25.64 --> 01:52:26.64 And
01:52:26.64 --> 01:52:27.64 Someone's like
01:52:27.64 --> 01:52:28.64 Oh go check out the video
01:52:28.64 --> 01:52:29.64 That mic he made
01:52:29.64 --> 01:52:30.64 And I go
01:52:30.64 --> 01:52:31.64 Okay cool
01:52:31.64 --> 01:52:32.64 And mic he shows me this video
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:35.64 And it's like a firefight happening
01:52:35.64 --> 01:52:36.64 Yeah
01:52:36.64 --> 01:52:38.64 And he's filming and he's putting
01:52:38.64 --> 01:52:39.64 Stick in the camera
01:52:39.64 --> 01:52:40.64 Up above the wall
01:52:40.64 --> 01:52:42.64 And then he turns it back on himself
01:52:42.64 --> 01:52:43.64 And he says
01:52:43.64 --> 01:52:45.64 The name of the part of town that they were fighting
01:52:45.64 --> 01:52:47.64 And was called the Malab district
01:52:47.64 --> 01:52:49.64 And mic he forwards the camera
01:52:49.64 --> 01:52:50.64 And himself
01:52:50.64 --> 01:52:51.64 And he goes
01:52:51.64 --> 01:52:53.64 It's the Moulin
01:52:53.64 --> 01:52:54.64 And so
01:52:54.64 --> 01:52:56.64 I'm looking at him laughing
01:52:56.64 --> 01:52:57.64 And then you know me being Mr.
01:52:57.64 --> 01:52:58.64 Professional
01:52:58.64 --> 01:52:59.64 And I go
01:52:59.64 --> 01:53:00.64 Hey man
01:53:00.64 --> 01:53:01.64 And he's a new guy
01:53:01.64 --> 01:53:02.64 And I'm you know
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:03.64 Jockel you know
01:53:03.64 --> 01:53:04.64 And so I go
01:53:04.64 --> 01:53:05.64 Hey man
01:53:05.64 --> 01:53:06.64 I'm filming
01:53:06.64 --> 01:53:07.64 When there's a firefight going on
01:53:07.64 --> 01:53:08.64 I go you need to get your gun up
01:53:08.64 --> 01:53:09.64 I don't want to see this again
01:53:09.64 --> 01:53:10.64 And he's like
01:53:10.64 --> 01:53:12.64 Hey sorry sir
01:53:12.64 --> 01:53:14.64 But I was Winchester
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:15.64 I go
01:53:15.64 --> 01:53:16.64 All right man
01:53:16.64 --> 01:53:17.64 Film some videos
01:53:17.64 --> 01:53:18.64 That's all you got left
01:53:18.64 --> 01:53:18.64 Be the Hister
01:53:18.64 --> 01:53:19.64 Be the document guy
01:53:19.64 --> 01:53:21.64 And just like in my opinion
01:53:21.64 --> 01:53:22.64 To go Winchester
01:53:22.64 --> 01:53:24.64 For a seal
01:53:24.64 --> 01:53:25.64 If he's anything like
01:53:25.64 --> 01:53:26.64 Like arm machine gunners
01:53:26.64 --> 01:53:28.64 That's pretty tough to do
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:29.64 Oh yeah
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:29.64 So
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:32.64 It's not like mic he wasn't carrying a tone around
01:53:32.64 --> 01:53:32.64 Yeah
01:53:32.64 --> 01:53:33.64 Like I said
01:53:33.64 --> 01:53:34.64 My point of telling this story
01:53:34.64 --> 01:53:36.64 Was that
01:53:36.64 --> 01:53:38.64 You know this was happening on a
01:53:38.64 --> 01:53:39.64 You know fairly regular basis
01:53:39.64 --> 01:53:40.64 Definitely firefight
01:53:40.64 --> 01:53:41.64 He wasn't going Winchester all the time
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:42.64 But he didn't know
01:53:42.64 --> 01:53:43.64 But I'm just saying like
01:53:43.64 --> 01:53:44.64 Well times
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:46.64 And he was in
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:47.64 You know
01:53:47.64 --> 01:53:49.64 Almost daily firefighters
01:53:49.64 --> 01:53:51.64 I remember that
01:53:51.64 --> 01:53:53.64 For to this is an actual number
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:53.64 So
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:56.64 The first 24 operations that that
01:53:56.64 --> 01:53:57.64 Element went on
01:53:57.64 --> 01:53:58.64 In a row
01:53:58.64 --> 01:53:59.64 They got to a firefight
01:53:59.64 --> 01:54:00.64 In the city
01:54:00.64 --> 01:54:01.64 Yeah
01:54:01.64 --> 01:54:02.64 And then they had one
01:54:02.64 --> 01:54:03.64 Where they didn't and then they went right back to it again
01:54:03.64 --> 01:54:05.64 So they were getting a lot of firefights
01:54:05.64 --> 01:54:07.64 And in a lot of danger
01:54:07.64 --> 01:54:09.64 And
01:54:09.64 --> 01:54:11.64 When we got home
01:54:11.64 --> 01:54:12.64 When I got home
01:54:12.64 --> 01:54:13.64 And I got to know his family
01:54:13.64 --> 01:54:14.64 A little bit
01:54:14.64 --> 01:54:16.64 His family was saying that when he'd call
01:54:16.64 --> 01:54:17.64 They'd be like
01:54:17.64 --> 01:54:18.64 What are you doing over there
01:54:18.64 --> 01:54:19.64 And he'd say
01:54:19.64 --> 01:54:20.64 Oh we're just training
01:54:20.64 --> 01:54:21.64 Some Iraqi soldiers
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:21.64 Yeah
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:23.64 We're just on base
01:54:23.64 --> 01:54:24.64 Just you know
01:54:24.64 --> 01:54:25.64 Don't worry about anything
01:54:25.64 --> 01:54:26.64 It's just fine
01:54:26.64 --> 01:54:28.64 Typical combat soldiers
01:54:28.64 --> 01:54:29.64 Fitting stories
01:54:29.64 --> 01:54:30.64 To the family
01:54:30.64 --> 01:54:32.64 Typical badass
01:54:32.64 --> 01:54:33.64 Yeah
01:54:33.64 --> 01:54:34.64 So that reminds me of you
01:54:34.64 --> 01:54:36.64 Don't worry about it
01:54:36.64 --> 01:54:37.64 You just got blown up
01:54:37.64 --> 01:54:38.64 Yeah
01:54:38.64 --> 01:54:39.64 Yeah
01:54:39.64 --> 01:54:39.64 Yeah
01:54:39.64 --> 01:54:40.64 Yeah
01:54:40.64 --> 01:54:41.64 Then
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:43.64 Here we go
01:54:43.64 --> 01:54:44.64 I woke up with a doctor
01:54:44.64 --> 01:54:46.64 Looming over me
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:47.64 Took a few moments
01:54:47.64 --> 01:54:49.64 For the anesthetics to wear off
01:54:49.64 --> 01:54:50.64 And for me to remember
01:54:50.64 --> 01:54:53.64 Where I was and what was going on
01:54:53.64 --> 01:54:55.64 Then it came back to me
01:54:55.64 --> 01:54:56.64 In a rush
01:54:56.64 --> 01:54:57.64 The mission
01:54:57.64 --> 01:54:59.64 The landmine, the pain, the surgery
01:54:59.64 --> 01:55:01.64 The surgeon standing
01:55:01.64 --> 01:55:02.64 By my bed
01:55:02.64 --> 01:55:03.64 Put it to me bluntly
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:06.64 I had to cut off both your feet
01:55:11.64 --> 01:55:12.64 Boom
01:55:12.64 --> 01:55:15.64 I believe earlier
01:55:15.64 --> 01:55:17.64 We were talking about
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:19.64 Irreversible situations
01:55:19.64 --> 01:55:20.64 Yep
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:21.64 And here you were
01:55:25.64 --> 01:55:27.64 Was that real to you at that time?
01:55:27.64 --> 01:55:29.64 Yeah
01:55:29.64 --> 01:55:31.64 Or would you basically
01:55:31.64 --> 01:55:32.64 Hey
01:55:32.64 --> 01:55:34.64 I'm happy I'm alive
01:55:34.64 --> 01:55:36.64 Like I got a seal buddy
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:39.64 That got blown up
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:40.64 Yeah
01:55:40.64 --> 01:55:42.64 And
01:55:42.64 --> 01:55:43.64 And actually didn't get blown up
01:55:43.64 --> 01:55:44.64 You got shot
01:55:44.64 --> 01:55:45.64 And
01:55:45.64 --> 01:55:46.64 Anyways
01:55:46.64 --> 01:55:48.64 One of my buddies was talking to him
01:55:48.64 --> 01:55:50.64 And he's like a bro
01:55:50.64 --> 01:55:51.64 And
01:55:51.64 --> 01:55:53.64 I'm really sorry about
01:55:53.64 --> 01:55:53.64 You know
01:55:53.64 --> 01:55:54.64 Because he lost his leg
01:55:54.64 --> 01:55:55.64 He was wrong
01:55:55.64 --> 01:55:57.64 He was sorry about your leg
01:55:57.64 --> 01:55:58.64 You know
01:55:58.64 --> 01:55:59.64 And he goes
01:55:59.64 --> 01:56:00.64 Fuck my leg
01:56:00.64 --> 01:56:02.64 I'm happy to be alive
01:56:02.64 --> 01:56:03.64 And
01:56:03.64 --> 01:56:04.64 I got to be honest
01:56:04.64 --> 01:56:05.64 I didn't think that
01:56:05.64 --> 01:56:06.64 Yeah
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:07.64 Um
01:56:07.64 --> 01:56:10.64 Soul drink is done on your feet
01:56:10.64 --> 01:56:12.64 And I immediately went
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:14.64 Into defensive
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:15.64 Mode
01:56:15.64 --> 01:56:16.64 I
01:56:16.64 --> 01:56:18.64 Half my brain said
01:56:18.64 --> 01:56:19.64 You tell that
01:56:19.64 --> 01:56:21.64 Fucking guy to go back
01:56:21.64 --> 01:56:22.64 And get that
01:56:22.64 --> 01:56:24.64 One of the feet
01:56:24.64 --> 01:56:26.64 And put it back
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:28.64 And the other half is saying
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:30.64 He's a pro
01:56:30.64 --> 01:56:31.64 He knows what he's doing
01:56:31.64 --> 01:56:32.64 If he took
01:56:32.64 --> 01:56:34.64 Because we knew one was gone
01:56:34.64 --> 01:56:35.64 On the scene
01:56:35.64 --> 01:56:36.64 That was the one that detonated
01:56:36.64 --> 01:56:37.64 The device
01:56:37.64 --> 01:56:39.64 The landmine did exactly what it was supposed to do
01:56:39.64 --> 01:56:41.64 It blew my foot off
01:56:41.64 --> 01:56:43.64 The mortar bomb shredded
01:56:43.64 --> 01:56:44.64 My other foot
01:56:44.64 --> 01:56:46.64 And on the scene
01:56:46.64 --> 01:56:48.64 I remember as I was
01:56:48.64 --> 01:56:49.64 Getting put onto the structure
01:56:49.64 --> 01:56:51.64 And getting put onto the ambulance
01:56:51.64 --> 01:56:53.64 That was finally able to get to us
01:56:53.64 --> 01:56:55.64 Because they literally
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.64 Plowed a road to me with a combat bulldozer
01:56:58.64 --> 01:57:00.64 And had the ambulance behind it
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:01.64 Um
01:57:01.64 --> 01:57:02.64 The medic
01:57:02.64 --> 01:57:03.64 From Recky Platoon said
01:57:03.64 --> 01:57:05.64 Hey man, your left foot
01:57:05.64 --> 01:57:07.64 We got it back into place
01:57:07.64 --> 01:57:08.64 Looks like it might be okay
01:57:08.64 --> 01:57:09.64 So
01:57:09.64 --> 01:57:10.64 But your right foot's gone
01:57:10.64 --> 01:57:11.64 I'm like, okay
01:57:11.64 --> 01:57:12.64 Whatever
01:57:12.64 --> 01:57:13.64 Again at this point I'm like
01:57:13.64 --> 01:57:14.64 So out of it
01:57:14.64 --> 01:57:15.64 So when I woke up
01:57:15.64 --> 01:57:16.64 And he says
01:57:16.64 --> 01:57:16.64 Yeah
01:57:16.64 --> 01:57:18.64 You know I had to take both feet
01:57:18.64 --> 01:57:19.64 Huh?
01:57:19.64 --> 01:57:21.64 Hmm
01:57:21.64 --> 01:57:24.64 And in my mind
01:57:24.64 --> 01:57:25.64 I'm thinking like, well
01:57:25.64 --> 01:57:26.64 How am I going to
01:57:26.64 --> 01:57:28.64 How am I going to do this job?
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:31.64 Okay
01:57:31.64 --> 01:57:32.64 And then so then I go
01:57:32.64 --> 01:57:35.64 And depending on who's
01:57:35.64 --> 01:57:37.64 Manual you're reading
01:57:37.64 --> 01:57:38.64 Or which doctor wrote it
01:57:38.64 --> 01:57:40.64 There's certain number of steps
01:57:40.64 --> 01:57:41.64 To grieving
01:57:41.64 --> 01:57:43.64 And they say losing a part
01:57:43.64 --> 01:57:44.64 A body part is like
01:57:44.64 --> 01:57:46.64 Losing a family member or something
01:57:46.64 --> 01:57:48.64 So now I'm dealing with two deaths
01:57:48.64 --> 01:57:49.64 And the family
01:57:49.64 --> 01:57:52.64 And the first step is always denial
01:57:52.64 --> 01:57:53.64 And you know
01:57:53.64 --> 01:57:54.64 And I'm like, ah well
01:57:54.64 --> 01:57:56.64 It's 2007
01:57:56.64 --> 01:57:57.64 You know how awesome
01:57:57.64 --> 01:57:58.64 You know guys are going to be jealous
01:57:58.64 --> 01:57:59.64 I had my legs blown off
01:57:59.64 --> 01:58:00.64 I'm going to be like
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:01.64 Rob I'm going to be like
01:58:01.64 --> 01:58:02.64 Astroboy
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:03.64 Be flying around
01:58:03.64 --> 01:58:04.64 And shit
01:58:04.64 --> 01:58:06.64 I'll have like Robo Coplegs or something
01:58:06.64 --> 01:58:07.64 It's cool
01:58:07.64 --> 01:58:08.64 It's 2007
01:58:08.64 --> 01:58:09.64 Right? Everything's digital
01:58:09.64 --> 01:58:10.64 Um
01:58:10.64 --> 01:58:12.64 And I kind of
01:58:12.64 --> 01:58:14.64 Whether it was the drugs
01:58:14.64 --> 01:58:16.64 And or the endorphins
01:58:16.64 --> 01:58:18.64 From going through all that
01:58:18.64 --> 01:58:20.64 First
01:58:20.64 --> 01:58:21.64 Until I was out of
01:58:21.64 --> 01:58:24.64 Candahar that was my attitude
01:58:24.64 --> 01:58:27.64 You know right up to the boys all came in
01:58:27.64 --> 01:58:29.64 To see me off because we went from
01:58:29.64 --> 01:58:32.64 So I think I spent another day in Candahar
01:58:32.64 --> 01:58:34.64 They flew me to Bagrum
01:58:34.64 --> 01:58:36.64 And then I flew to Kuwait
01:58:36.64 --> 01:58:37.64 And then from Kuwait
01:58:37.64 --> 01:58:39.64 On to
01:58:39.64 --> 01:58:40.64 Germany
01:58:40.64 --> 01:58:41.64 Yeah but
01:58:41.64 --> 01:58:43.64 Lange to Longstool
01:58:43.64 --> 01:58:45.64 And so every stop that we picked up
01:58:45.64 --> 01:58:47.64 Moved American
01:58:47.64 --> 01:58:48.64 Serviceman
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:50.64 And I think there was one other Canadian
01:58:50.64 --> 01:58:51.64 But
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:52.64 So
01:58:52.64 --> 01:58:54.64 I just
01:58:54.64 --> 01:58:55.64 You know that's how I felt
01:58:55.64 --> 01:58:56.64 Right?
01:58:56.64 --> 01:58:58.64 And then once I was in Germany
01:58:58.64 --> 01:59:00.64 Um
01:59:00.64 --> 01:59:07.64 I was just trying to deal with every day by day
01:59:07.64 --> 01:59:08.64 You know
01:59:08.64 --> 01:59:10.64 I just was
01:59:10.64 --> 01:59:13.64 You know they put me in a room with another guy
01:59:13.64 --> 01:59:15.64 Who had been hit in an IED strike on a
01:59:15.64 --> 01:59:17.64 So a lab you were saying L.A.
01:59:17.64 --> 01:59:19.64 V. earlier so those are the
01:59:19.64 --> 01:59:21.64 Marine Corps has an act of some L.A. V.
01:59:21.64 --> 01:59:22.64 So that's why I was calling it that.
01:59:22.64 --> 01:59:24.64 Yeah so it's lighter armored vehicle
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:27.64 And you guys in the army here they're called
01:59:27.64 --> 01:59:28.64 Strikers
01:59:28.64 --> 01:59:29.64 Except
01:59:29.64 --> 01:59:31.64 R is have turrets and I think yours has like
01:59:31.64 --> 01:59:33.64 Remote 50 cows or something
01:59:33.64 --> 01:59:35.64 They're all made in London Ontario
01:59:35.64 --> 01:59:37.64 Candahar by the way
01:59:37.64 --> 01:59:39.64 Um
01:59:39.64 --> 01:59:41.64 So
01:59:41.64 --> 01:59:42.64 Yeah I was just trying to deal with each day
01:59:42.64 --> 01:59:43.64 As it can't because now I'm
01:59:43.64 --> 01:59:46.64 I've never there's no training for this
01:59:46.64 --> 01:59:47.64 Right?
01:59:47.64 --> 01:59:49.64 And casual decimulation
01:59:49.64 --> 01:59:51.64 It stops once you're declared dead
01:59:51.64 --> 01:59:53.64 Or evacuated right?
01:59:53.64 --> 01:59:55.64 So now I'm in a stage where I'm like
01:59:55.64 --> 01:59:57.64 Okay I'm in a room with another Canadian dude
01:59:57.64 --> 01:59:59.64 Um
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:01.64 And American army hospital
02:00:01.64 --> 02:00:03.64 And
02:00:03.64 --> 02:00:05.64 I don't know
02:00:05.64 --> 02:00:07.64 What's next?
02:00:07.64 --> 02:00:10.64 And every time I look down
02:00:10.64 --> 02:00:12.64 There's no toes to wiggle
02:00:12.64 --> 02:00:16.64 It was just so I'm like okay
02:00:16.64 --> 02:00:18.64 Well I'm just going to try and deal with this
02:00:18.64 --> 02:00:20.64 Just deal with it
02:00:20.64 --> 02:00:21.64 Just deal with it
02:00:21.64 --> 02:00:25.64 And I was in that mode for weeks
02:00:25.64 --> 02:00:27.64 Yeah
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:29.64 I'm waiting
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:31.64 I think I was waiting for a point
02:00:31.64 --> 02:00:34.64 Where someone was going to give me my diagnosis
02:00:34.64 --> 02:00:36.64 You know or my
02:00:36.64 --> 02:00:39.64 The conclusion
02:00:39.64 --> 02:00:42.64 Or like a prescription like okay here's what you're going to do now
02:00:42.64 --> 02:00:45.64 This is what not just with your legs but with your life
02:00:45.64 --> 02:00:46.64 Yeah this is what's going to happen
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:48.64 You're going to do this you're going to follow these steps
02:00:48.64 --> 02:00:52.64 And at the end you'll be deploying back to Afghanistan
02:00:52.64 --> 02:00:54.64 Which is how it was going to my mind
02:00:54.64 --> 02:00:57.64 You know I don't know what you're going to read next
02:00:57.64 --> 02:00:59.64 But I was convinced
02:00:59.64 --> 02:01:01.64 I'm going to back out guys
02:01:01.64 --> 02:01:03.64 That's it like
02:01:03.64 --> 02:01:06.64 That's it
02:01:06.64 --> 02:01:10.64 Whenever you know the Navy or the Army wants to know something they send you on course
02:01:10.64 --> 02:01:13.64 So you know I was on snab or course and then you go on
02:01:13.64 --> 02:01:15.64 You go on driver course you go on
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:18.64 Tactically carry course, teach triple C
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:21.64 So as you're saying this that's actually the next portion
02:01:21.64 --> 02:01:22.64 Yeah
02:01:22.64 --> 02:01:23.64 That I was going to really good
02:01:23.64 --> 02:01:23.64 Okay
02:01:23.64 --> 02:01:25.64 Here you go exactly what you were just about to get into
02:01:25.64 --> 02:01:28.64 From that point on I made it my mission to learn to walk again
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:30.64 I treated rehab like a military course
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:33.64 When the military wants a soldier to learn something
02:01:33.64 --> 02:01:37.64 They send him on a course so as the approach I took with my rehab
02:01:37.64 --> 02:01:39.64 The mission mindset right there
02:01:41.64 --> 02:01:43.64 But at the same time
02:01:43.64 --> 02:01:48.64 And now we start going into the fact that it was obvious that the military system
02:01:48.64 --> 02:01:52.64 The military system just couldn't quite cope with my needs
02:01:52.64 --> 02:01:56.64 Sure I was offered help with all sorts of things from rehab to finding a home
02:01:56.64 --> 02:02:01.64 But no one truly understood the needs that are particular to a returning soldier
02:02:01.64 --> 02:02:03.64 And neither did I
02:02:03.64 --> 02:02:05.64 No
02:02:07.64 --> 02:02:13.64 So you didn't even know I mean how do you know that but that's what I'm saying how can you know there's no course for that
02:02:13.64 --> 02:02:16.64 There's no course there's no course there's no training
02:02:19.64 --> 02:02:23.64 You know and and our military medical system was
02:02:23.64 --> 02:02:25.64 Like like the
02:02:25.64 --> 02:02:30.64 We have lots of medics we have doctors for things like spring dangles and
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:35.64 And you know you hurt your back on a rock march whatever whatever
02:02:35.64 --> 02:02:38.64 Lots of guys and girls to do that
02:02:38.64 --> 02:02:41.64 No you know our physiotherapists we got physiotherapists
02:02:41.64 --> 02:02:45.64 But they've been dealing with tennis elbow and spring dangles for 40 years
02:02:45.64 --> 02:02:46.64 And let's know
02:02:46.64 --> 02:02:48.64 Detachment to them
02:02:48.64 --> 02:02:49.64 It's not their fault
02:02:49.64 --> 02:02:50.64 It's
02:02:50.64 --> 02:02:53.64 They just that's the military that they were in
02:02:53.64 --> 02:02:58.64 And you compare that in the book you talk about when you went to the Center for a trip in San Antonio
02:02:58.64 --> 02:03:01.64 And now you had the American system which has been
02:03:01.64 --> 02:03:03.64 Unfortunately
02:03:03.64 --> 02:03:05.64 Dealing with
02:03:05.64 --> 02:03:08.64 Thousands and thousands and thousands
02:03:08.64 --> 02:03:10.64 Yeah of wounded soldiers
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:14.64 For at that point I guess for you guys about four five years
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:16.64 Okay four five years
02:03:16.64 --> 02:03:18.64 Well it was oh well oh seven yeah
02:03:18.64 --> 02:03:21.64 And I guess you guys started in 01 right after that
02:03:21.64 --> 02:03:21.64 Yep
02:03:21.64 --> 02:03:25.64 I don't whoever whenever the guys first went in after the towers dropped
02:03:25.64 --> 02:03:30.64 And so they had experience and they have giant amount of money
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:35.64 I mean this is America and we do have a lot of money and they put a lot of money into it
02:03:35.64 --> 02:03:40.64 And and at the same time you had some Canadian folks that were like
02:03:40.64 --> 02:03:41.64 We don't need that kind of stuff
02:03:41.64 --> 02:03:43.64 You don't need those kind of things for rehab
02:03:43.64 --> 02:03:47.64 Right right well again I'm you know we have
02:03:47.64 --> 02:03:51.64 I'm trying to think of a correlation here
02:03:51.64 --> 02:03:55.64 But anyway we had these physiotherapists it's a trade in the military
02:03:55.64 --> 02:04:01.64 You're your military physiotherapist and your job is to rehab guys like me
02:04:01.64 --> 02:04:06.64 And I'm telling you you can't do it or you I'm telling you that you're failing
02:04:06.64 --> 02:04:11.64 And this is why so your reaction is going to be well I know I do my job
02:04:11.64 --> 02:04:15.64 And I don't so I don't at the time I was furious
02:04:15.64 --> 02:04:17.64 In retrospect
02:04:17.64 --> 02:04:19.64 They didn't know any better
02:04:19.64 --> 02:04:22.64 And that's why I started advocating so hard
02:04:22.64 --> 02:04:24.64 I got because I got home
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:26.64 And I said this is what we got to do
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:29.64 There's not that many guys like me coming home
02:04:29.64 --> 02:04:33.64 I mean yeah there's a lot more than there were last year because we're actually at war
02:04:33.64 --> 02:04:39.64 The center for the intrepid Walter Reed and I believe there's one here the naval medical
02:04:39.64 --> 02:04:40.64 Is that yeah
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:43.64 Medical center bubble and there's Bethesda as well so
02:04:43.64 --> 02:04:45.64 Well I've heard of three
02:04:45.64 --> 02:04:47.64 San Antonio Walter Reed and the one here
02:04:47.64 --> 02:04:54.64 Those are the biggies yeah those are the ones where most of the traumatic injuries have been going from from from you guys
02:04:54.64 --> 02:04:56.64 So I said
02:04:56.64 --> 02:05:03.64 Let's start sending a pair of physiotherapists down with like for every physiotherapist we send down or for every two casualties
02:05:03.64 --> 02:05:04.64 We send down
02:05:04.64 --> 02:05:07.64 Let's send down one of our physiotherapists and in six months
02:05:07.64 --> 02:05:13.64 That physiotherapist will get more experience dealing with more injuries at
02:05:13.64 --> 02:05:17.64 With more patients and they could ever hope for on base pedoawa
02:05:17.64 --> 02:05:24.64 Where tuber gate is because we're talking the difference between a couple of dozen soldiers getting hurt playing rugby
02:05:24.64 --> 02:05:27.64 Or whatever or ruck marching versus
02:05:27.64 --> 02:05:35.64 Actually, yeah like a parade of guys getting smashed and IED strikes and air you know whatever was happening
02:05:35.64 --> 02:05:41.64 You know I was standing there in the guy who ran Antonio at the San Antonio at the time was
02:05:41.64 --> 02:05:44.64 He was in green beret
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:48.64 Fidio therapist so I don't know if he was one and then the other or how it worked
02:05:48.64 --> 02:05:55.64 But so he's the lead physiotherapist and I remember this Marine walked into the room
02:05:55.64 --> 02:06:01.64 And he had both legs gone above the knee so he's on the taller leg prosthetics
02:06:01.64 --> 02:06:06.64 And he was blinded by it because he had been burned or whatever
02:06:06.64 --> 02:06:13.64 And this guy he's in full uniform he like screams the guy's name he's like goons and he tackles him
02:06:13.64 --> 02:06:20.64 And they start wrestling and I'm like yeah I want that because the hospital I was in
02:06:20.64 --> 02:06:24.64 And again no offense to the hospital I got great medical care
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:28.64 For the standard
02:06:28.64 --> 02:06:31.64 To their capabilities
02:06:31.64 --> 02:06:37.64 And it it's not like it was bad but it wasn't what would have been best for me
02:06:37.64 --> 02:06:44.64 Me being a soldier so I'm like because I'm in a hospital where it's knee and hip replacements and amputations from diabetes
02:06:44.64 --> 02:06:50.64 So as a lot of older people I was probably one of the youngest people in the hospital at 30
02:06:50.64 --> 02:06:53.64 I was definitely in the best shape
02:06:53.64 --> 02:06:56.64 You know like I remember my first physiotherapy session
02:06:56.64 --> 02:07:01.64 She hands me a four pound bean bag weight with a strap on it
02:07:01.64 --> 02:07:09.64 She says oh I strap that around your leg and you know trying to like you know maybe maybe 15 or 20 leg raises
02:07:09.64 --> 02:07:12.64 If you think you can and I'm like
02:07:12.64 --> 02:07:13.64 Uh-huh
02:07:13.64 --> 02:07:15.64 Where's the squat rack here
02:07:15.64 --> 02:07:20.64 So I strap it I'm like four pounds is that enough and she's like oh yeah
02:07:20.64 --> 02:07:23.64 We don't want to start too hard nice sweet lady great person
02:07:23.64 --> 02:07:25.64 I love her the best she can she's what she knows
02:07:25.64 --> 02:07:27.64 She's doing what she knows
02:07:27.64 --> 02:07:31.64 I strap the thing to my stump and I start doing leg raises
02:07:31.64 --> 02:07:33.64 And she comes back like 10 minutes later
02:07:33.64 --> 02:07:35.64 She's like so how many did you get done? I'm like
02:07:35.64 --> 02:07:37.64 I don't know
02:07:37.64 --> 02:07:41.64 I'm wondering how much maybe 250 she's like oh oh
02:07:41.64 --> 02:07:45.64 And I'm like yeah, I'm in shape
02:07:45.64 --> 02:07:48.64 It was just meat and bone smash like I don't have any other injuries here
02:07:48.64 --> 02:07:51.64 But there it's San Antonio
02:07:51.64 --> 02:07:58.64 The lead therapist is tackling and wrestling with a blind legless marine and I'm like that's what I need
02:07:58.64 --> 02:08:04.64 I need to be around soldiers and people who know how I think and I can't help
02:08:04.64 --> 02:08:09.64 Again, and I'm not trying to criticize or or be overly
02:08:09.64 --> 02:08:11.64 Um
02:08:11.64 --> 02:08:14.64 Determental to the results of what came
02:08:14.64 --> 02:08:18.64 But imagine if I had had that treatment
02:08:18.64 --> 02:08:23.64 What you know people would say oh jodey you did fine you did great you're the poster boy
02:08:23.64 --> 02:08:25.64 Imagine if I had been in San Antonio
02:08:25.64 --> 02:08:31.64 You know where could have ate faster you think not well
02:08:31.64 --> 02:08:35.64 The level of expectation where I was was very very low
02:08:35.64 --> 02:08:38.64 So they didn't like so if I had been in San Antonio
02:08:38.64 --> 02:08:41.64 They'd been like well, no, no, you will be walking by March
02:08:41.64 --> 02:08:43.64 You will do this and you whereas
02:08:43.64 --> 02:08:47.64 Where I was because that's how they do it
02:08:47.64 --> 02:08:51.64 It's like well we'll see where you're at you know and this and that and there is no
02:08:51.64 --> 02:08:58.64 There's no one for me to mentor under or be you know like there's no one to be compared to or should be compared to
02:08:58.64 --> 02:09:01.64 Look at this guy over here he's grappling with another dude
02:09:01.64 --> 02:09:03.64 Even though he's blind is missing a leg
02:09:03.64 --> 02:09:05.64 Yeah, and are you ready to get it on?
02:09:05.64 --> 02:09:09.64 Yeah, you know another guy came in I think he was a marine too
02:09:09.64 --> 02:09:12.64 And he was wearing just like a t-shirt
02:09:12.64 --> 02:09:14.64 And the same guy is like hey
02:09:14.64 --> 02:09:16.64 Where's your issue PT kit?
02:09:16.64 --> 02:09:18.64 The Marine Corps doesn't play around
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:21.64 And this was the green break guy right but he's but
02:09:21.64 --> 02:09:26.64 Because it's a mixed force right there's Air Force Navy Marine whoever's there
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:30.64 There was a there is a Navy I believe she was Navy EOD had her arms blown off
02:09:30.64 --> 02:09:35.64 And she was recently in that range 15 movie I think it's the same girl
02:09:35.64 --> 02:09:40.64 I've only met one girl who had both her arms blown off by by an EOD by an IED
02:09:40.64 --> 02:09:43.64 But so I imagine it's her but anyway
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:48.64 He expected you to be a soldier regardless of what happened to you
02:09:48.64 --> 02:09:52.64 You're gonna maintain that persona son and I was like yeah
02:09:52.64 --> 02:09:56.64 Because I could feel myself slipping at this other place because there's no expectations
02:09:56.64 --> 02:10:00.64 You know and you can only self-mote
02:10:00.64 --> 02:10:05.64 And having never had my legs blown off before
02:10:05.64 --> 02:10:11.64 I could only me self-mote of eight to a point for so long
02:10:11.64 --> 02:10:16.64 And be the guy, be my own drill surgeon and be my own
02:10:16.64 --> 02:10:21.64 And be my own inspector and there's a reason and I say this all the time
02:10:21.64 --> 02:10:26.64 There's a reason why the best athletes in the world have coaches
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:27.64 Yeah
02:10:27.64 --> 02:10:31.64 That's the fact that somebody has got to show you the way
02:10:31.64 --> 02:10:32.64 Yeah
02:10:32.64 --> 02:10:34.64 And furthermore you can only push yourself so hard
02:10:34.64 --> 02:10:39.64 I know for a fact you can only push yourself to a hundred and seven percent
02:10:39.64 --> 02:10:43.64 A coach is gonna get you to a hundred and seventeen percent
02:10:43.64 --> 02:10:44.64 Yeah
02:10:44.64 --> 02:10:46.64 Push you a little bit harder to have no mercy
02:10:46.64 --> 02:10:48.64 And so that's what you need, that's what everybody's
02:10:48.64 --> 02:10:49.64 Yeah
02:10:49.64 --> 02:10:55.64 You know and so but again I try to give credit where credits do and give
02:10:55.64 --> 02:10:58.64 You know people were worried when I wrote the book
02:10:58.64 --> 02:11:00.64 There were people I heard that were worried
02:11:00.64 --> 02:11:02.64 And I'm not I don't want to shit on anyone
02:11:02.64 --> 02:11:05.64 And I don't want it to seem like I'm blaming anyone for anything
02:11:05.64 --> 02:11:10.64 I put myself there I'm the one that wanted to be in that spot to step on that landline
02:11:10.64 --> 02:11:16.64 My only expectation was that others would have put the preparation into their mission
02:11:16.64 --> 02:11:22.64 As I put into mine and I do feel that there were some at very high levels
02:11:22.64 --> 02:11:26.64 That maybe didn't take things as seriously as they should have
02:11:26.64 --> 02:11:30.64 Or realized the consequences of what was coming
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:35.64 And take best practices from places like Walter Reed San Antonio
02:11:35.64 --> 02:11:40.64 Because when I said San me to San Antonio and send a Canadian physiotherapist with me
02:11:40.64 --> 02:11:43.64 And she's gonna learn in the three or six months
02:11:43.64 --> 02:11:47.64 I'm there more than she will in twenty years at any Canadian base
02:11:47.64 --> 02:11:51.64 It was oh well we appreciate that medic
02:11:51.64 --> 02:11:54.64 But you know we're working on a Canadian solution
02:11:54.64 --> 02:11:57.64 And I was like well that's gonna be awesome
02:11:57.64 --> 02:12:00.64 Once you figure out whatever the fuck that is what about me
02:12:00.64 --> 02:12:05.64 I'm talking about right this second we have a facility willing to take us
02:12:05.64 --> 02:12:08.64 So did they send PT's down there?
02:12:08.64 --> 02:12:09.64 No
02:12:09.64 --> 02:12:13.64 Because here's here's the back room stuff
02:12:13.64 --> 02:12:14.64 The politics
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:20.64 Joe what would the civilians think if we were sending our soldiers to a different country's medical centers
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:23.64 When we got hospitals right here
02:12:23.64 --> 02:12:30.64 Now again what we were getting at the hospital was not bad care
02:12:30.64 --> 02:12:33.64 You know what I'm saying?
02:12:33.64 --> 02:12:35.64 Do you understand the distinction trying to make it?
02:12:35.64 --> 02:12:36.64 Okay, okay
02:12:36.64 --> 02:12:43.64 It was it was the best care to the capability and the knowledge and understanding that they had
02:12:43.64 --> 02:12:47.64 Not only of their job but of the people that they were working with
02:12:47.64 --> 02:12:52.64 Yeah, in other words you got if you got a 72 year old diabetic that has an amplitude
02:12:52.64 --> 02:12:58.64 The 4 pound weight is good and that you can try and transfer that over to Joe
02:12:58.64 --> 02:13:02.64 Dmitik who just got off the battlefield three weeks ago
02:13:02.64 --> 02:13:05.64 Yeah, he's a different animal
02:13:05.64 --> 02:13:12.64 Yeah, because you're an exception too right to like what they what they're trained and what they're really good at caring for
02:13:12.64 --> 02:13:16.64 You come in and this is like this isn't really typical that we all have to deal with
02:13:16.64 --> 02:13:18.64 Yeah, why are we gonna change our whole system?
02:13:18.64 --> 02:13:25.64 Yeah, exactly but even things like I remember the first couple nurses that came into my room
02:13:25.64 --> 02:13:28.64 They were like oh hey honey, what happened with car accident?
02:13:28.64 --> 02:13:33.64 Rean a motorcycle you're on a motor really well losing your foot is very typical of motorcycle accident
02:13:33.64 --> 02:13:41.64 But they didn't I'm like oh I stepped on a landmine and Afghanistan we even have soldiers in Afghanistan
02:13:41.64 --> 02:13:47.64 Yeah, and I was like oh so hence hence this part of the book
02:13:47.64 --> 02:13:54.64 Ironically one of the biggest emotional problems I had to deal with was the anger I felt towards a medical system
02:13:54.64 --> 02:13:57.64 That did not seem to be able to respond appropriately to my needs
02:14:00.64 --> 02:14:04.64 Now you ended up putting on weight because you couldn't exercise
02:14:04.64 --> 02:14:08.64 And you do give a little shout out right here to the dairy queen
02:14:08.64 --> 02:14:12.64 And you say the dairy queen is delicious when you're depressed
02:14:12.64 --> 02:14:15.64 Oh, it's so good.
02:14:15.64 --> 02:14:18.64 Once it hits the lips
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:22.64 The peanut butter cups and it's worldly ice cream
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:25.64 I might have to get one right after this jacco
02:14:25.64 --> 02:14:28.64 We might have to find a dairy queen up in here
02:14:28.64 --> 02:14:32.64 So in conjunction with the therapy sessions
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:38.64 I also started taking an anti-depressant to start to help control my moods
02:14:38.64 --> 02:14:47.64 And then there was the other kind of pain the physical kind I was still using pain killers to dull the pain that was there each and every day
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:53.64 I needed that relief so badly but in the end that too caused me tremendous suffering
02:14:53.64 --> 02:14:59.64 And I turned into something I never thought I would be an addict
02:14:59.64 --> 02:15:12.64 We've definitely our scene this happened with our wounded veterans
02:15:12.64 --> 02:15:22.64 And here you go. In no time I was taking more of the drug that I was supposed to in order to relieve my psychological and physical pain
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:29.64 The addiction worsened and I started crushing the pills into a powder and snorting it to get a better high
02:15:29.64 --> 02:15:36.64 Those pills gave me relief from my stress and mental pain if only for a little while
02:15:36.64 --> 02:15:42.64 But as soon as they wore off, my demons would return
02:15:42.64 --> 02:15:47.64 I worried about my future
02:15:47.64 --> 02:15:54.64 If I wasn't a soldier who was I
02:15:57.64 --> 02:16:06.64 And you've already said that a bunch of times that feeling of I mean everything you'd been in your life
02:16:06.64 --> 02:16:12.64 From when you were a kid that was what was inside of you and then you were able to act on that
02:16:12.64 --> 02:16:19.64 And become that soldier serving combat get after it on the battlefield
02:16:19.64 --> 02:16:23.64 My whole adult life I became a man in the military
02:16:23.64 --> 02:16:31.64 I joined as a 17 year old, 174 pound, 6 foot, 4 skinny weakling
02:16:31.64 --> 02:16:39.64 I grew into the man that you see and that question when I was reading that
02:16:39.64 --> 02:16:43.64 When I had a buddy that retired the other day
02:16:43.64 --> 02:16:46.64 You know, 25 years
02:16:46.64 --> 02:16:50.64 And I just said to him I said, now was it clean now your locker
02:16:50.64 --> 02:16:53.64 Because I don't know what it's like for you guys but in the sealed teams you have a locker
02:16:53.64 --> 02:16:57.64 And that's your whole career is physically represented
02:16:57.64 --> 02:17:01.64 And the lockers are big. They're walking lockers. They're awesome
02:17:01.64 --> 02:17:04.64 Oh wow, each guy has a walking locker
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:09.64 And there's a big drawing we call them a drying cage or calm cages because it's just made with a chain link
02:17:09.64 --> 02:17:14.64 Basically, but each guy has their own, their own, their own, this is big is this office
02:17:14.64 --> 02:17:18.64 You've got cruise boxes in there and it's your whole career is physically represented
02:17:18.64 --> 02:17:22.64 Of everything you've ever been issued anything that you picked up along the way
02:17:22.64 --> 02:17:25.64 Trinkets, everything is in your drying cage
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:27.64 And when you retire
02:17:27.64 --> 02:17:33.64 You go, you clean out your cage, it's empty, you sweep out the floor, you glowed into your van
02:17:33.64 --> 02:17:35.64 You drive home and that's it, it's over
02:17:35.64 --> 02:17:39.64 And so I said to my buddy there, I said, you know, how was it?
02:17:39.64 --> 02:17:41.64 How was it clean out your drying cage?
02:17:41.64 --> 02:17:44.64 Because for me, I wasn't even worried about retiring
02:17:44.64 --> 02:17:48.64 I'm like, okay, I gotta go do this, I gotta do this, I'm all good, come back
02:17:48.64 --> 02:17:50.64 Clean it out my cage
02:17:50.64 --> 02:17:52.64 And I'm like, oh, this is over
02:17:52.64 --> 02:17:55.64 And for me, I spent 18 out of 20 years out here on the west coast
02:17:55.64 --> 02:18:01.64 And all within like a stone's throw of the different buildings
02:18:01.64 --> 02:18:05.64 I mean, all within these certain number of buildings
02:18:05.64 --> 02:18:07.64 Since I was a kid
02:18:07.64 --> 02:18:12.64 And the question, so when I was reading that you wrote this
02:18:12.64 --> 02:18:13.64 That's what I was thinking about
02:18:13.64 --> 02:18:15.64 What my buddy was thinking
02:18:15.64 --> 02:18:21.64 If I'm not a soldier, if I'm not a seal, then what am I?
02:18:21.64 --> 02:18:25.64 And that's a tough question to answer
02:18:25.64 --> 02:18:27.64 For a lot of guys
02:18:27.64 --> 02:18:31.64 It's brutal and it comes back to what we were talking about before
02:18:31.64 --> 02:18:32.64 Dwelling
02:18:32.64 --> 02:18:34.64 Right
02:18:34.64 --> 02:18:43.64 I, it was really hard for me because I didn't choose to leave
02:18:43.64 --> 02:18:46.64 I'd always imagine I'd be abounded
02:18:46.64 --> 02:18:51.64 I don't know why, like, you know, visualization is very important
02:18:51.64 --> 02:18:53.64 In my opinion, in our line of work
02:18:53.64 --> 02:19:00.64 And so I'd always try to envision a good being wound, okay, but it was like the cool scar across the cheek
02:19:00.64 --> 02:19:02.64 Or like some shrapnel in the rib cage
02:19:02.64 --> 02:19:05.64 I could show off a barbecue, you know, and talk about when I'm like 80
02:19:05.64 --> 02:19:07.64 Yeah, so I've got some Taliban and menl in there
02:19:07.64 --> 02:19:11.64 But, you know, like, it's that or it's a body bag
02:19:11.64 --> 02:19:13.64 You don't think about the in-between
02:19:13.64 --> 02:19:16.64 Even our system, right, our medical system and Canada
02:19:16.64 --> 02:19:19.64 Lots of body bags, lots of bandages
02:19:19.64 --> 02:19:24.64 But, the in-between part, they kind of dropped the ball
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:26.64 Yeah, and years ago
02:19:26.64 --> 02:19:30.64 World War I probably World War II, you wouldn't have made it
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:32.64 They wouldn't have to deal with you
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:34.64 No, because you would have blood out
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:37.64 They didn't know teach RippleC, they wouldn't have gotten your calves back
02:19:37.64 --> 02:19:40.64 I mean, it would have been you would have died, that's all the rest of it
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:42.64 Yeah, double amputation, yeah, forget about it
02:19:42.64 --> 02:19:45.64 So they just didn't have that back then
02:19:45.64 --> 02:19:47.64 Vietnam got a lot better
02:19:47.64 --> 02:19:50.64 In terms of the Casivac situation, they could have a lot faster
02:19:50.64 --> 02:19:52.64 That's why you don't have a lot more of it
02:19:52.64 --> 02:19:55.64 But, figure out what you're going to do next
02:19:55.64 --> 02:20:00.64 And you held onto it, you held onto it, you tried to hang onto it
02:20:00.64 --> 02:20:02.64 Because you decided you know what, I'm going to still be a soldier
02:20:02.64 --> 02:20:05.64 Yeah, you got done with it, you did a half marathon
02:20:05.64 --> 02:20:09.64 But after that half marathon, you were just to beat up
02:20:09.64 --> 02:20:15.64 Yeah, from that, and you decided that
02:20:15.64 --> 02:20:18.64 Well, here's what you put in the book, I tell people
02:20:18.64 --> 02:20:22.64 That Jodie the soldier was wounded in January of 2007
02:20:22.64 --> 02:20:24.64 But it took him about two years to die
02:20:24.64 --> 02:20:28.64 To let the soldier in you go
02:20:28.64 --> 02:20:33.64 And I'm going to continue
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:36.64 Of course, this wasn't an easy decision for me
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.64 And I was filled with rage and anger
02:20:38.64 --> 02:20:41.64 And again, I started using oxy-coctin
02:20:41.64 --> 02:20:45.64 As a relief from the pain of loss
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:47.64 It became my problem yet again
02:20:47.64 --> 02:20:52.64 But I diluted myself into believing I had it under my control
02:20:52.64 --> 02:21:03.64 You talk about this thing where you're reading a reader's digest article
02:21:03.64 --> 02:21:06.64 Yeah, and there's an oxy-coctin addict in there
02:21:06.64 --> 02:21:09.64 Yeah, and he's talking about how he's shooting it up
02:21:09.64 --> 02:21:13.64 And you said to yourself, you weren't thinking, oh, that's horrible
02:21:13.64 --> 02:21:17.64 I can't believe you're like, I didn't know you could answer that
02:21:17.64 --> 02:21:20.64 And that is what hits you
02:21:20.64 --> 02:21:25.64 Yeah, and I think that is what hits you
02:21:25.64 --> 02:21:28.64 Realizing that's when you realize you weren't in control
02:21:28.64 --> 02:21:30.64 I mean, that's got to be that moment
02:21:30.64 --> 02:21:36.64 Because the story was he was a doctor, I believe, injecting himself
02:21:36.64 --> 02:21:39.64 In the bathroom and his young daughter walked in
02:21:39.64 --> 02:21:41.64 And I had now had a young daughter
02:21:41.64 --> 02:21:45.64 And I could just, I now am like, and in my mind, it wasn't
02:21:45.64 --> 02:21:50.64 Oh, imagine if my daughter caught me going to inject, I went, oh, I can inject
02:21:50.64 --> 02:21:54.64 And I even went through a second way
02:21:54.64 --> 02:21:58.64 I remember how great it was to get the intervenes drugs in the hospital
02:21:58.64 --> 02:22:03.64 And then the next second was, oh, this is not good
02:22:03.64 --> 02:22:05.64 This is not good
02:22:05.64 --> 02:22:10.64 And then when I ended up buying, I ended up buying per cassette, which is like
02:22:10.64 --> 02:22:15.64 Goxie cotton, but like, from a guy that I knew through another guy
02:22:15.64 --> 02:22:17.64 And it was they were in Ziplock bags
02:22:17.64 --> 02:22:19.64 Basically a drug deal
02:22:19.64 --> 02:22:23.64 Remember that thing they got me arrested 20 years ago
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:28.64 And I went, okay, this is it, this ends here
02:22:28.64 --> 02:22:32.64 Well, that's an awesome, I mean, that's awesome credit to you all that
02:22:32.64 --> 02:22:37.64 Because so many people, unfortunately they don't take ownership of that
02:22:37.64 --> 02:22:40.64 They don't say to themselves, you know what?
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:43.64 I am addicted and this thing is controlling me
02:22:43.64 --> 02:22:47.64 And they always say things like just what you said, oh, I got this under control
02:22:47.64 --> 02:22:50.64 I can stop if I want to, I just don't want to
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:52.64 I need it, I'm in pain
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:53.64 There he go
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:55.64 I had to take it
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:55.64 Yeah
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:58.64 And I would ask the doctors, I would say, how do we get, how do we get me off this?
02:22:58.64 --> 02:23:01.64 And this was still, you know, oh seven, oh eight
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:05.64 Nine, I think it was 2011 before I finished
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:07.64 Or got off them
02:23:07.64 --> 02:23:13.64 They still had, and candidly, anyway, hadn't realized what oxy cotton was capable of
02:23:13.64 --> 02:23:17.64 And so the dogs, it's like three days of withdrawals
02:23:17.64 --> 02:23:19.64 It's fine, don't worry about it
02:23:19.64 --> 02:23:23.64 Those withdrawals were worse than being wounded
02:23:23.64 --> 02:23:27.64 Those three days, here's your quote
02:23:27.64 --> 02:23:31.64 Those three days were absolute horror
02:23:31.64 --> 02:23:35.64 Quitting oxy cotton was harder and more painful
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:38.64 Then getting blown up in Afghanistan
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:39.64 Yeah
02:23:41.64 --> 02:23:45.64 Because, because it was three days
02:23:45.64 --> 02:23:48.64 Whereas I was in the worst
02:23:48.64 --> 02:23:52.64 Jocco echo, I cannot tell you what the pain was like
02:23:52.64 --> 02:23:53.64 Because it was so bad
02:23:53.64 --> 02:23:56.64 And that was the pain from going from withdrawals
02:23:56.64 --> 02:23:57.64 No, the pain from getting blown up
02:23:57.64 --> 02:23:58.64 Okay, so the pain from getting blown up
02:23:58.64 --> 02:24:00.64 I cannot describe it to you
02:24:00.64 --> 02:24:05.64 But the withdrawals lasted three days of that kind of pain
02:24:05.64 --> 02:24:08.64 Because your body and your mind are trying to trick you
02:24:08.64 --> 02:24:12.64 You're still in pain, man, you're still in pain, you should take him, you should take him
02:24:12.64 --> 02:24:14.64 But once, you know what's funny?
02:24:14.64 --> 02:24:18.64 Though the three days, it's almost like you hit a switch
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:21.64 And suddenly the pain starts to dissipate
02:24:21.64 --> 02:24:24.64 The hollow feeling in your chest
02:24:24.64 --> 02:24:27.64 And just to fill back in
02:24:27.64 --> 02:24:30.64 The that stop crawling on your skin
02:24:30.64 --> 02:24:32.64 Because that's ergoing through all that
02:24:32.64 --> 02:24:35.64 I was grinding the stumps of my legs into the coach
02:24:35.64 --> 02:24:38.64 To give it some kind of other sensation
02:24:38.64 --> 02:24:41.64 Other than I described it as like
02:24:41.64 --> 02:24:43.64 It was like a dog, you ever watch a dog chew on a bone
02:24:43.64 --> 02:24:46.64 When he's going to between his paws and he's just going to town
02:24:46.64 --> 02:24:48.64 Like with his teeth, that's what it felt like
02:24:48.64 --> 02:24:49.64 On the ends of my legs
02:24:49.64 --> 02:24:57.68 my legs was like I had like an animal just knowing on my legs. And then one day of you know
02:24:57.68 --> 02:25:01.72 wherever the third or second and two and a half for three days later I realized I'm like
02:25:01.72 --> 02:25:10.44 oh most of that's kind of pretty much gone. It's crazy. And I tell you there's Jodi before
02:25:10.44 --> 02:25:16.000 he quit ox cotton and then there's Jodi a Jodi before he quit was still trying his best
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.92 and doing well and if you talked to anybody was the guy a lot of people looked up to but
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:26.08 things really started to turn around after I quit. You know I really started to become
02:25:26.08 --> 02:25:33.60 capable of a lot in my mind I think there's a big difference. But man that shit just my
02:25:33.60 --> 02:25:39.68 buddy he's a he's a parrot trooper and he had to get some surgery on his knee. You know
02:25:39.68 --> 02:25:44.40 parrot troopers are always banging up their knees and the dogger gave him a coating or
02:25:44.40 --> 02:25:48.40 a ton of three or something like that and he literally took it and threw it in the garbage.
02:25:48.40 --> 02:25:53.04 He's like I saw it out in a jodi. I just like I don't even I don't want anything.
02:25:53.04 --> 02:26:00.88 And that's my advice kids out there do not take it if you don't if you can greet your
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:08.48 teeth enough do not take that shit. Stay clean. Do your best. I wouldn't trust me around it now.
02:26:08.48 --> 02:26:16.24 If you had one I might take it. I don't it's good. Let's just take some more of this
02:26:16.24 --> 02:26:21.68 alphabet brain. Take the alphabet brain. I'll get on it instead of getting addicted again.
02:26:21.68 --> 02:26:32.48 Get off it by getting on it. So now you get through it you're not addicted to
02:26:32.48 --> 02:26:39.92 oxycod anymore and now it's what do my gonna do with my life. Yeah and here you go. What did I
02:26:39.92 --> 02:26:45.04 actually want and what was possible and could I really put my military pass behind me and
02:26:45.04 --> 02:26:50.48 pursue something else that would make me feel fulfilled but it was time to stop asking questions.
02:26:50.48 --> 02:26:52.64 It was time to find some answers.
02:26:52.64 --> 02:27:09.44 And here you're kind of referring back and it's the last chapter. It's called on my own two feet.
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:14.80 I would actually still get a sense of humor after all this. Can't make fun of yourself man.
02:27:15.84 --> 02:27:20.16 Taking life way to series. So a lot of professional athletes will tell you they missed
02:27:20.16 --> 02:27:24.80 two things when they retire the competition on the field and the camaraderie with the team late
02:27:24.80 --> 02:27:29.44 teammates in the locker room. It's the exact same thing for soldiers after we leave the armed forces.
02:27:30.56 --> 02:27:36.24 When I see soldiers on parade I still get chills down my spine because I loved it so much.
02:27:40.72 --> 02:27:44.56 Just letting everybody know that that's completely normal. For all you guys that got out for
02:27:44.56 --> 02:27:50.48 whatever reason totally normal. Jody feels it. I feel it. We all feel that.
02:27:52.80 --> 02:28:00.16 So then you went and did the amazing race in Canada. Yeah we had the you got second place with your brother.
02:28:00.16 --> 02:28:05.36 Second place and it was the first season because the American amazing race was the most popular
02:28:05.36 --> 02:28:10.88 show in Canada. So let's make a Canadian. Let's make a Canadian one. If Canadians love anything
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:17.36 more than the American version it's the Canadian version. Then you ended up doing this city councilor thing.
02:28:17.36 --> 02:28:25.60 Yeah. And that's where you're at now. That's where I'm at now.
02:28:26.88 --> 02:28:31.44 You know one part that we haven't talked about and I'm gonna do it a little bit of
02:28:31.44 --> 02:28:39.12 uh I'm gonna score a few brownie points here at home. So I said they had to plow a road to me. Yeah.
02:28:39.12 --> 02:28:45.60 To rescue me right. They literally plowed a road with a combat bulldozer and right behind it was what
02:28:45.60 --> 02:28:53.92 we call a buys and ambulance and it's an eight-wheeled almost built in the same factory as the LAV in Ontario.
02:28:53.92 --> 02:29:04.08 And London Ontario Canada by unionized workers and and the commander of that vehicle was
02:29:04.08 --> 02:29:11.76 master corpola lana Gilmore of the Canadian forces medical corps who is now my wife retired
02:29:11.76 --> 02:29:19.04 surgeon a lana Gilmore of the Canadian forces medical corps and we have two beautiful daughters
02:29:19.04 --> 02:29:34.000 Aela seven and cure a four and we we we managed to connect I was wounded in January we connected
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:41.04 in September or Octoberish of the same of 2007 my girlfriend that I had had when I got wounded had
02:29:41.04 --> 02:29:49.76 left no fault of hers I don't blame her one one bit you know to get thrown into a situation where
02:29:49.76 --> 02:29:57.84 you have to care for a wounded soldier a guy who before was like a rock you know and that's not what
02:29:57.84 --> 02:30:04.56 she signed up for right and and and a lana had recently broken up with with with her partner as well
02:30:04.56 --> 02:30:09.92 and when we found each other though the fact that she was a hot Irish blonde was just really
02:30:09.92 --> 02:30:17.60 a bonus got to be honest and and she took one you know jocco I call medics they're like
02:30:17.60 --> 02:30:24.56 our momies what do you guys have corps men you call them because combat guys were little
02:30:24.56 --> 02:30:28.08 loads that saying if you're gonna be tough you if you're gonna be dumb you got to be tough
02:30:28.08 --> 02:30:31.76 you're gonna be stupid you got to be tough yeah and that's and that's us we need the corpsmen
02:30:31.76 --> 02:30:36.32 or the medic to be like hey hey hey jocco why are you limping what come here come here
02:30:36.32 --> 02:30:41.52 come here come here no no no not in front of the other troops mom stop it stop it and and so that's
02:30:41.52 --> 02:30:47.76 their job so she saw me she took one look at me she's like you look terrible I was surviving on
02:30:47.76 --> 02:30:54.96 vector cereal and drive through sandwiches because I was by myself all the boys were still deployed
02:30:54.96 --> 02:31:02.48 or on course and I was living in my own private house on base so I'd moved on to base I had this
02:31:02.48 --> 02:31:07.52 little puppy Charlie who wasn't he's not a service dog by any stretch but he's the only
02:31:07.52 --> 02:31:11.52 reason I got it a bed in the morning so I owe him he's still my buddy still at that he's at the
02:31:11.52 --> 02:31:19.36 house right now and so she went into medic mode really she went you know what you should come
02:31:19.36 --> 02:31:24.48 by my house bring your dog you can play with my dog and you know let's just hang out and when we got
02:31:25.52 --> 02:31:30.16 when we saw each other though it was camaraderie she was one of the last people to see me on the
02:31:30.16 --> 02:31:38.48 battlefield she carried my stretcher to the to the to the evac chopper and you know if you talk to her
02:31:38.48 --> 02:31:47.20 the fact that I was you know a bearded hot guy was just a bonus to her too and you know
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:56.24 eventually I let her kiss me guys okay passively I'm sure yeah now she likes she she's going to
02:31:56.24 --> 02:32:04.40 ask me did you tell jockel the same joke you tell everyone else that I kissed you but when we we got
02:32:04.40 --> 02:32:14.96 pregnant a little quick a Elizabeth A September do the math so but you know we realized
02:32:16.72 --> 02:32:20.40 we talked about it when we talked about the survivors guilt you don't you didn't survive
02:32:20.40 --> 02:32:28.16 you know your friends live for your friends I didn't survive and she didn't like her vehicle hit
02:32:28.16 --> 02:32:34.64 landmines and she was ambushes and all you know near near death on a battlefield is a bullet
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:40.000 going in from your head that's near death yeah you laugh about it after but that's so she was in
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:47.68 all that too and so she's pregnant and and I should have died and who knows what could have happened
02:32:47.68 --> 02:32:53.68 to her and who were we to deny what's happening you know so I I have I had to throw that out there
02:32:53.68 --> 02:33:00.56 that you know I have three beautiful blondes in my life with blue eyed blondes that you know
02:33:00.56 --> 02:33:08.40 keep me in check and because I the the feelings I had in the book they're not all in the past
02:33:09.44 --> 02:33:15.92 you know I woke up yesterday when I missed the flight man it it was more
02:33:15.92 --> 02:33:23.76 that I was disappointing you right and hear me out right because I was just like I was like
02:33:25.28 --> 02:33:29.60 I'm the city counselor and a lot of guys look up to me and this and that and all you know
02:33:29.60 --> 02:33:35.36 like got these kids and you know Lanna and I and I still can't make a fucking flight you know
02:33:35.36 --> 02:33:39.12 and I haven't even met the guy yet and I'm already disappointing him and that went through me
02:33:39.68 --> 02:33:44.08 and it's all because I stepped on that stupid landline but I wouldn't even be here if I had
02:33:44.08 --> 02:33:48.08 stepped on that landline I wouldn't have had these I wouldn't have these kids if I hadn't
02:33:48.08 --> 02:33:53.44 stepped on that landline after my second fiance walked out of the house and my you know like
02:33:53.44 --> 02:33:57.68 all I said that's my joke I like all good soldiers I have three ex fiancees and it does an
02:33:57.68 --> 02:34:01.76 ex girlfriend's sacrifice to the queen because we still swear allegiance to the queen
02:34:02.88 --> 02:34:09.60 because it's real that's like you said the teams come first and I had said well I'm going to retire
02:34:09.60 --> 02:34:16.32 about 44 with 25 years in so why don't I just start kids and I'll add that and I'm sure my life
02:34:16.32 --> 02:34:24.16 would be fine if I hadn't stepped on the landline but would it be as fulfilling would I be as as as
02:34:24.16 --> 02:34:33.68 as broad or would I be as complete I'm sure I'd be a kickass speck-op sniper somewhere doing
02:34:33.68 --> 02:34:43.20 something but I couldn't have met like if if I had a wish to not step on the mine but I wouldn't
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:50.64 get to keep the kids I'd step on that mine 10 times at a ten and so I had to you know I'd throw
02:34:50.64 --> 02:34:58.16 it in there and give credit to Lana for what she did for me and also my friends and family right
02:34:58.16 --> 02:35:05.84 this nobody does it no one's a rock you know so I just had to say all that yeah no and I actually
02:35:06.48 --> 02:35:10.80 I have a question about your wife okay I was going to keep you an opportunity to steal some of your
02:35:10.80 --> 02:35:16.48 thunder not at all not at all I'm glad you I'm glad you put that out there and also I didn't want
02:35:16.48 --> 02:35:21.28 to steal thunder from your book right and it was one of the things that I was going to tell people I mean
02:35:21.28 --> 02:35:27.20 obviously I think people who's going to buy this I mean obviously I there's this is the a big book
02:35:27.20 --> 02:35:33.12 which I've taken some excerpts out of yeah and there's so much more in it when you read it
02:35:33.12 --> 02:35:38.32 and you get the whole the whole package one of which is you explaining these relationships
02:35:38.96 --> 02:35:48.16 with your wife with your kids how that happened which is just I mean for all practical purposes
02:35:48.16 --> 02:35:55.36 let's just call it what it is that's a miracle yeah
02:35:55.36 --> 02:36:04.80 here's how it closes out people often ask me if I regret my time in afghanistan because it
02:36:04.80 --> 02:36:13.60 cost me my two feet and completely changed my life if you live your life with regrets then you
02:36:13.60 --> 02:36:19.52 never move forward those six months in afghanistan before the explosion were some of the best
02:36:19.52 --> 02:36:27.20 times of my life I can honestly say as I look back on my life in the military I wouldn't
02:36:27.20 --> 02:36:32.88 have changed a thing if I hadn't stepped on that landmine I would never have connected with a
02:36:32.88 --> 02:36:39.92 Lana I would never have had two beautiful daughters my mind and body were pushed to the limit
02:36:40.56 --> 02:36:46.72 after my accident and ironically I came out on the other side a better more complete person
02:36:46.72 --> 02:36:55.76 maybe life would be easier now if I hadn't lost a part of both legs but it certainly wouldn't have
02:36:55.76 --> 02:37:02.88 been any more complete when I when I am in public today advocating for veterans rights or simply
02:37:02.88 --> 02:37:08.40 going about my daily life people sometimes approach me to say thank you for your service
02:37:08.40 --> 02:37:16.000 those five words mean more to me than anything else
02:37:24.08 --> 02:37:27.92 and now I'd like to say something jodie from me
