00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.12 This is Jockel Pondcast number 216 with echo Charles and me, a Jockel Willick. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.92 --> 00:00:19.92 In attack, most daring, in defense, most cunning, in endurance, most steadfast. They performed
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:28.24 a few of arms which will be remembered and recounted as long as the virtues of courage and resolution
00:00:28.24 --> 00:00:40.000 have the power to move the hearts of men. And that right there is Winston Churchill speaking
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.12 in honor of the British First Airborne Division at honor and him. He was actually making that
00:00:49.12 --> 00:00:59.84 statement on September 22nd, 1944 in which the battle was not actually even over yet. And we did
00:00:59.84 --> 00:01:09.20 cover that faithful battle on podcast 94 from the book called Medit R. N. by Jeffrey Powell
00:01:09.20 --> 00:01:19.52 and it's just an incredible book and an account of the British Airborne Division in that battle
00:01:19.52 --> 00:01:31.04 where they lost almost 75% of its strength. And from that point on was for all practical purposes
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:42.72 out of the war. So who were these men that made this stand? We saw one when we covered Jeffrey
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:54.56 Powell's book, but obviously there were thousands more each one of hero and also each one a
00:01:54.56 --> 00:02:04.80 a human being. And I recently got a book in the mail that someone sent me. The book was written
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:12.000 by one such man, one such human being. The book is called The Memory In Durs and it was written by
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:29.52 a man named Reg Curtis. So let's go to this book and meet and learn and honor a hero of a human being.
00:02:31.20 --> 00:02:38.32 Here we go. Chapter one's called Pray Loot to War as a youth I carried out milk. I carried
00:02:38.32 --> 00:02:43.20 out a milk ground in the early morning and a newspaper around in the evening, earning four
00:02:43.20 --> 00:02:49.28 shillings a week, which helped towards the cost of the special clothing I needed as a choir boy
00:02:49.28 --> 00:02:57.44 at St Augustine's Church near Grove Park Railway Station. When I left school in 1934 at the age of
00:02:57.44 --> 00:03:04.24 14, I got a job at Elliott Brothers and Electrical and Mechanical Engineers firm in Lusham.
00:03:04.24 --> 00:03:10.64 I cycled five miles to and from work Monday to Saturday and learned quickly under the
00:03:10.64 --> 00:03:17.20 washful eye of the charge hand learning how to operate a milling machine, center lathe, hydraulic
00:03:17.20 --> 00:03:24.80 press and finally working as a captain, a center operator. I had to just read that part because
00:03:25.60 --> 00:03:30.80 you know you always hear about the old man who had to go five miles to work in five mile home
00:03:30.80 --> 00:03:39.44 uphill both ways. There you go. There you go. Redg Curtis was doing it. After three years I was
00:03:39.44 --> 00:03:44.72 beginning to set and by the way he's like 14 years old at this time just a kind of FYI. So
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.52 after three years I was beginning to settle in for a long-term job when a series of small
00:03:51.52 --> 00:04:00.72 strikes put the damper on my enthusiasm. The persistent industrial action prompted my decision
00:04:00.72 --> 00:04:06.24 to join the army where such strikes were not tolerated. You kind of get the impression this is
00:04:06.24 --> 00:04:12.88 odd guy, right? He's there having strikes whatever he says where where where can I go where that's
00:04:12.88 --> 00:04:18.56 not going to happen. Oh I know the army. My father had been in the Royal Army Service Corps and my
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:23.84 grandfather was the chairman of the Royal British Legion so the army seemed natural enough in my
00:04:23.84 --> 00:04:30.08 family. I was encouraged by my uncle Fred himself a regimental sergeant major. I chose the footguards
00:04:30.08 --> 00:04:35.52 because after a short-term of service I would be acceptable to the city of London police. In those
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:40.48 days you had to be at least five and five feet ten and a half inches tall to be a policeman.
00:04:41.52 --> 00:04:47.60 I was already six one and still growing. I presented myself to the guards recruiting office in London
00:04:47.60 --> 00:04:55.92 and enlisted with the first or grenadier regiment of the footguards. And flowing forward a little bit
00:04:55.92 --> 00:05:01.92 that there was one corporal Tucker. So now he's you know going through the boot camp scenario.
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:08.96 There was one corporal Tucker. My squad instructor who took great delight in marching us on
00:05:08.96 --> 00:05:15.28 to the frozen parade ground with extra zest. Then put us on a charge if we slipped up.
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:21.20 So you not only received a sore rump but also got extra parade as punishment. Another approach
00:05:21.20 --> 00:05:26.72 was to march us toward a large puddle and then give the order to mark time. Come on knees higher.
00:05:26.72 --> 00:05:32.08 He would shout from a safe distance, scrutinizing each man and turn and looking for any signs of cracking.
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:36.56 We were just numbers at Caterham.
00:05:38.24 --> 00:05:45.36 Though this day I say it did me no harm as it instilled a self-discipline that has served me well
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:50.96 through life. That's what you're going to get. And you know you and I were talking earlier about
00:05:50.96 --> 00:05:57.76 basically normal face. Basically look I'm not going to show that this is not fun. I'm not going
00:05:57.76 --> 00:06:06.32 to show. And you were saying that you learn if you say look no factor right? No factor. I got to do
00:06:06.32 --> 00:06:10.16 this hard thing. No factor. Not hey I got to do this hard thing so I'm going to get mentally
00:06:10.16 --> 00:06:17.84 all fired up. No no just no factor. And you learn over time that saying no factor keeping it in your
00:06:17.84 --> 00:06:23.68 head actually you get better at it. And all of a sudden hard things you just go I'm just going to do it.
00:06:23.68 --> 00:06:29.12 I'm just going to attack it. That's one of the things that this type of military training does.
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:35.36 And even he's saying look the stuff that this guy's going to go through is a thousand times harder
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:40.72 than doing mark time march on the parade ground for an hour. Thousands of times harder infinitely
00:06:40.72 --> 00:06:48.16 harder. But there's a little less in that he learned. And plus he's British right? And the Brits
00:06:48.16 --> 00:06:54.32 with the stiff upper lip that's that's like a whole culture at least it used to be because the
00:06:54.32 --> 00:07:00.56 culture's changed a lot and Britain but this warrior culture of hey they're literally England
00:07:00.56 --> 00:07:05.20 if you think about it the stiff upper lip which is hey we're just going to go do that's that's the
00:07:05.20 --> 00:07:11.20 no factor culture of hey we got something to do cool we're going to go do it watch this with this is
00:07:11.20 --> 00:07:16.32 England what do we got we got some hard for us cool no factor step up or let move forward.
00:07:19.12 --> 00:07:24.56 Fast for in a little bit so he gets like one of his first jobs is is sort of
00:07:25.28 --> 00:07:33.68 guarding the the royal family and so he does some of that and then moves on to kind of the regular
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:39.04 army going back to look soon enough I left the glamour of Windsor and the comfort of
00:07:39.04 --> 00:07:45.20 Victoria Barracks behind it was sent to pair bright in Surrey where every guard's men goes
00:07:45.20 --> 00:07:51.44 for field work craft and firing on the open range it was my duty to be able to handle and fire
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:57.28 a gun in preparation to protect King and Country in an emergency but trust my luck to a fallen
00:07:57.28 --> 00:08:04.96 fall and fall of bad weather it was not really my cup of tea to prostrate myself on a wet
00:08:04.96 --> 00:08:09.60 and windstrip flying right range with a sergeant breathing down my neck whispering words of encouragement
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:15.20 and added supply of rainwater running over me in torrents from his ground sheet cape
00:08:16.88 --> 00:08:21.28 this is this is not the way you'd hear a US Marine described.
00:08:21.28 --> 00:08:27.52 Being on the range in a rainy day you know that's such a British way of explaining this and then
00:08:27.52 --> 00:08:33.68 he continues on it must have done some good as I made first class shot though for what purpose I was not yet
00:08:33.68 --> 00:08:38.80 sure so guess what this is supposed to world war one I think I want to say this is 1939 when he
00:08:38.80 --> 00:08:44.64 enlisted so there's maybe 30 maybe 38 actually I think it's 37 yeah 1937 he joined the army
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:52.08 so there's you know world war one was what 20 years in the past that was the war to end all wars
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:57.60 sure there's a guy in Germany that might begin a little up at he but he's saying hey look I
00:08:57.60 --> 00:09:01.28 know I gotta learn how to use this gun but not really sure what I need to know how to do this for
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:09.68 continuing on fast-forward a little bit in early in 1939 I was transferred to the home of the
00:09:09.68 --> 00:09:15.92 British Army at Aldershot in Hampshire I'll never forget the atmosphere of the night of the tattoo
00:09:15.92 --> 00:09:22.08 which tattoo is like a word for a parade basically when our battalion marched on dressed in navy blue
00:09:22.08 --> 00:09:29.28 trousers with red piping down the out seam outside out seam of each trouser leg long-sleeved
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:34.88 white wader type jackets with brass buttons and the guards peaked cap with red band around the crown
00:09:34.88 --> 00:09:40.56 carried out without a word of command our drilled display lasted for 20 minutes the finale being
00:09:40.56 --> 00:09:46.32 the only time a command was given the battalion will advance in review order by the entire by the
00:09:46.32 --> 00:09:54.72 center quick march 450 men moved his one and the reason I had that once again when you just think
00:09:54.72 --> 00:10:03.36 about human beings right psychologically in that moment look you're a cog in the wheel that's all you
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:10.88 are you're a pawn on the chessboard that's all you are but and he and he says it
00:10:11.92 --> 00:10:19.84 like that feeling that you get of being a part of something that's literally bigger than you are
00:10:19.84 --> 00:10:24.40 hey I'm just I'm just a guy out here in a uniform but there's 450 of us moving as one
00:10:25.44 --> 00:10:31.36 and there's some part of human instinct that likes to be a part of that tribe
00:10:31.36 --> 00:10:41.44 ummm continue on in August some mysterious goings on began unusual apparatus in the form of
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:46.80 digging equipment both powered and hand operated appeared along with wheel barrels and mountains of
00:10:46.80 --> 00:10:52.000 little sacks which turned out to be sandbags lorries loaded this lorries loaded with sand
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.88 would dump their contents at various points and instead of the usual drill parades and kit inspections
00:10:56.88 --> 00:11:01.92 we found ourselves filling these bags with sand and building barriers I thought it must be some
00:11:01.92 --> 00:11:06.72 sort of giant exercise and had no idea that it was in preparation for real enemy
00:11:07.52 --> 00:11:13.20 being confined to the barracks with its own shops and theater we didn't mix with the public
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:18.48 so new very little ball matters of national importance indeed in those days the serviceman was
00:11:18.48 --> 00:11:23.84 not allowed to discuss politics and we would put on charge if caught attending a political meeting
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:29.60 so these guys are completely isolated and I'm thinking about even when I joined the navy and
00:11:29.60 --> 00:11:34.40 we go on a ship we didn't know idea what's going on there's no internet yet and so we had no
00:11:34.40 --> 00:11:40.80 idea what was going on in the outside world and even even living on base I mean you at least
00:11:40.80 --> 00:11:46.56 when even when I joined you had key cable news right you knew that the CNN was on and you're watching
00:11:46.56 --> 00:11:53.68 CNN and you're knowing what's going on in the world there's no CNN there's no TV there's nothing
00:11:53.68 --> 00:11:57.20 so these guys are completely isolated they're living the all the stores are going to are on base
00:11:57.20 --> 00:12:01.52 the theaters on base so there's living on base paying no mind to what's going on overseas
00:12:02.08 --> 00:12:07.60 what does put on charge means getting trouble just in general yeah just in general like oh he
00:12:07.60 --> 00:12:12.96 got in trouble yeah okay so it's not like a you know because it's varying levels of you
00:12:12.96 --> 00:12:17.92 you're trying to any covers and he I'm glad you brought that up because it's he uses it throughout
00:12:17.92 --> 00:12:21.52 kind of the book because there's you get you can get one on charge for all kinds of stuff yeah
00:12:21.52 --> 00:12:28.08 and so it's just a general term that means being in trouble maybe written up maybe sent to the
00:12:28.08 --> 00:12:32.80 brig for a little time whatever but you know you got put on charge yeah no court martial
00:12:32.80 --> 00:12:37.52 nothing like this but could be you keep it up yeah if you well it could be too you like if you
00:12:37.52 --> 00:12:41.92 did something really bad you just got okay you know he's gonna get put on charge okay yeah I got
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:46.80 you and yes is any level of trouble is what I perceive to this maybe a brick military
00:12:46.80 --> 00:12:55.52 person will let us know if I'm wrong continue on on the third of September war was declared
00:12:55.52 --> 00:13:03.04 with Germany and I realized what all the sandbagging was for within days my battalion was mobilized
00:13:03.04 --> 00:13:09.12 reservists were called up and along with thousands of other troops two weeks later two weeks
00:13:09.12 --> 00:13:17.36 later we were in France I think I was quite unperturbed at the possibility of getting killed after
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:23.20 all I was a soldier trained to kill so why should I have any qualms you know what's nuts about this
00:13:24.24 --> 00:13:30.72 and I mean putting into perspective world war one which was now 20 years at hindsight was so
00:13:30.72 --> 00:13:41.04 insanely savage and yet this guy still regges like yeah you know what cool I'm not worried about
00:13:41.04 --> 00:13:49.28 getting killed I'm a soldier and you think about the casualties in World War one had to be
00:13:49.28 --> 00:13:57.68 had you had to beat it shows you it shows you how quickly we can forget right what war is
00:13:57.68 --> 00:14:02.24 because if you witnessed a day on the battlefield and World War one there's no way you'd want to do
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:11.84 any of that ever again but whatever your 20 years old you're crack shot with that rifle
00:14:13.36 --> 00:14:18.08 time to go get some continue on in the forward positions we oh yeah and by the way now I'm just
00:14:18.08 --> 00:14:23.12 jumping past hey they get there and by the way like I said they get to France two weeks later
00:14:23.12 --> 00:14:29.84 this isn't like okay we're doing a prolonged preparation no we're declaring war on the third
00:14:29.84 --> 00:14:36.32 and in September the third of September we're declaring war and then in September two weeks later
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:42.08 you're on the ground in France ready to get some in the forward positions so now they they start
00:14:42.08 --> 00:14:47.04 moving forward from France in the forward positions we took over deserted village called
00:14:47.04 --> 00:14:51.44 Tromborn about six miles from the German border as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided
00:14:51.44 --> 00:14:56.32 to make use of sheets to create so they're in these areas that are pretty much abandoned
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:00.40 and so they're going into houses and finding stuff as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:05.12 to make use of sheets to create sets of camouflage gear white suits gloves over boots hats and
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:10.24 coverings for rifles hunting around we've I found a sewing machine thinking that we might as well
00:15:10.24 --> 00:15:16.32 do things the easy way as a fighting patrol we didn't fire a shot there's more matter of
00:15:16.32 --> 00:15:20.32 listening and night reconnaissance in our white outfits carrying only rifles and are
00:15:20.32 --> 00:15:25.28 limited other gear we traveled more comfortably than we had previously which I skipped over the
00:15:25.28 --> 00:15:32.16 part where they're basically doing long long movements to get into positions on one night reconnaissance
00:15:32.16 --> 00:15:38.40 we became over confident don't what that happened and one of our lads knocked up against the enemy
00:15:38.40 --> 00:15:45.68 wire it was a still bright moonlit night we were in no man's land just 75 feet from the forward
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:51.44 German positions they're talking of stop to abruptly as luck would have it we were crawling so we
00:15:51.44 --> 00:15:57.04 froze hugging the ground for an hour without moving on another occasion we were on our way back
00:15:57.04 --> 00:16:03.20 to base when from and by the way on that one they they make it out on another occasion we were on
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:07.04 our way back to base when from the direction of a bend in the road 50 yards away we saw a group of
00:16:07.04 --> 00:16:12.08 figures we were about two miles from our lines and knew that no other patrols were out so these
00:16:12.08 --> 00:16:17.28 men must be the enemy our patrol leader gave the signal a lie still we were straddled each side of the
00:16:17.28 --> 00:16:23.36 road in semi-open ground but fortunately the night was not too bright the group passed by
00:16:23.36 --> 00:16:29.20 ten men in all spaced six to eight feet apart they were well-armed but war no white suits
00:16:29.20 --> 00:16:35.52 keeping them in view and moving only our eyes we lay unnoticed if we had been spotted they would have
00:16:35.52 --> 00:16:41.20 had the advantage because of their automatic weapons and also the fact that they as they passed
00:16:41.20 --> 00:16:48.32 down our center we could not have fired on them for fear of hitting our own men never separate your
00:16:48.32 --> 00:16:52.56 forces which is hard when you're walking down a road because when you're walking down a road you're
00:16:52.56 --> 00:16:56.64 going to be in a what's called a staggered file which means you got guys on either side of the road
00:16:56.64 --> 00:17:01.68 right which generally we're trying to stay off the roads anyways but sometimes that road is the
00:17:01.68 --> 00:17:04.56 smartest place to move you're going to make a bunch of noise moving through the brush and you can
00:17:04.56 --> 00:17:08.80 get on that road and move really quietly so it's something that can happen but then when they see
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:12.96 the enemy they all get off the road what's the quickest way to get off the road it's on the
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:16.48 room side that you're on and what does that mean you're on both sides of the road now in the
00:17:16.48 --> 00:17:21.76 enemy walks in between you and you start shooting at the enemy you're actually shooting each other
00:17:22.96 --> 00:17:32.32 so you have to be cognizant of that which these guys were continuing on when I came into contact
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:36.08 with two Germans and this is another thing about this book the first of all this book is not
00:17:36.08 --> 00:17:42.96 very long but the other thing that's that's crazy and British and no factor and stuff up a lip
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:51.44 is he'll he'll describe the most insane things that were factually crazy as like in three sentences
00:17:51.44 --> 00:17:57.28 of what and just really matter a fact you know so although there are times where he
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.32 definitely adds some color but that's the way he is just just kind of matter fact very British about
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:09.04 the whole thing when I came into contact with the two Germans for the first time myself I gave them
00:18:09.04 --> 00:18:14.16 five rounds of rapid fire to range of 50 yards as they edge towards me under the cover of garden
00:18:14.16 --> 00:18:19.92 walls and fencing they were my first shots in anger I didn't see the two Germans anymore so maybe
00:18:19.92 --> 00:18:25.44 they were lucky shots guardsman baitman and Elm's doubled past and shattered for me to come
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:30.88 on and we continued into open country making our way over to a bridge and halting roughly after
00:18:30.88 --> 00:18:37.28 roughly a thousand yards where we took up defensive positions air activity was increasingly
00:18:37.28 --> 00:18:43.84 tremendous measurement one-on-ones were machine gunning at low level and had strafed our troops
00:18:43.84 --> 00:18:51.28 coming over the bridge only a few minutes after I crossed there's these these talking about these
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:58.88 and I I don't know if I just never really thought about it this much detail but he talks about these
00:18:58.88 --> 00:19:04.16 you know the enemy aircraft coming in at low level and strafing them all the time and if you
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:10.80 were seeing a measure Schmidt they're just really bad ass looking aircraft and a lot of the
00:19:10.80 --> 00:19:15.44 German aircraft they just were I mean all the aircraft back then right I mean you got spit fires you
00:19:15.44 --> 00:19:21.28 got corsairs you got mustang you got a p-38 line but you got awesome looking aircraft that and if you
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:28.72 can imagine this too at that time those were the most technologically advanced things right
00:19:28.72 --> 00:19:36.32 so they didn't look they didn't look old right they looked like a x-wing fighter from star wars
00:19:36.32 --> 00:19:40.88 right that's what you were seeing you were seeing this magical machine that was just
00:19:41.76 --> 00:19:49.60 and now this thing is pointing at you at an altitude of like 300 or 400 feet and just dumping
00:19:49.60 --> 00:19:55.20 machine gun rounds at you and can you imagine the noise that they make with those big giant engines I mean
00:19:55.20 --> 00:20:03.28 yeah and so he talks about that a lot in these books and that's kind of the first encounter that
00:20:03.28 --> 00:20:08.56 he brings it up the other thing that scares me about it is it's sort of random you know it's
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:13.52 almost like mortar fire because the aircraft's gonna come down if it's pointed two degrees in
00:20:13.52 --> 00:20:18.48 that direction you're fine if it points two degrees in your direction your dead and the rounds are
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:24.48 hitting you know at a spacing of six feet or whatever when they get through ground so if you're
00:20:24.48 --> 00:20:29.36 in between those two six feet you're totally fine or you get hitting the face or in the head
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:36.56 and you're dead so there's this element of chance going on as well which I never like
00:20:36.56 --> 00:20:43.36 I never liked that element of chance continuing on leaving the area and traveling mainly on foot
00:20:43.36 --> 00:20:48.88 encountering few enemy on the ground but experiencing continuous shelling and bombing from the air
00:20:48.88 --> 00:20:56.32 we came to a stop by the river Asuka near the city of Tornai six miles from the French border
00:20:56.32 --> 00:21:03.28 here we went into a counterattack during which a very well-liked platoon commander Lutenette the Duke
00:21:03.28 --> 00:21:09.44 of Northumberland was killed Lance Corporal Harry Nichols and guardsmen Nash were ordered to
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:15.52 flush out some bothersome machine gun as 600 yards from our position that's British right you're
00:21:15.52 --> 00:21:23.76 going to describe machine gun as as bothersome the section I was in gave covering fire
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:29.60 what what what what is that all about yeah that's called cover move fundamental to our left
00:21:29.60 --> 00:21:33.84 they picked their way with caution Nichols and a light machine gun under each arm
00:21:33.84 --> 00:21:38.56 Nichols with a light machine gun under each arm I didn't see them anymore but they must have
00:21:38.56 --> 00:21:42.96 completed the mission because there were because the enemy fire ceased after a while Lance
00:21:42.96 --> 00:21:48.72 Corporal Nichols was posted missing presumed killed but later reported as being alive in enemy hands
00:21:48.72 --> 00:21:54.24 he was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action in the semi-built up area on the river the
00:21:54.24 --> 00:22:01.20 Germans afforded very good target practice for me I found that I just could not miss but we were all
00:22:01.20 --> 00:22:05.84 getting weary through lack of sleep and proper food no one can live off scraps or from scavenging
00:22:05.84 --> 00:22:12.000 for long without feeling the worst for it and enemy numbers were increasing tenfold or so it seemed
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:18.48 continuing on we came to another stop this was the last time I took part in a coordinated attack
00:22:18.48 --> 00:22:23.44 with the third battalion grendendier guards we went into a bayonet charge
00:22:26.88 --> 00:22:30.80 I say again we went into a bayonet charge at court to cure
00:22:30.80 --> 00:22:38.80 setting off I felt very scared and all sorts of things went through my mind like what the hell
00:22:38.80 --> 00:22:46.80 am I doing here oh yes I joined the army to become a policeman want a laugh the muck was flying fast
00:22:46.80 --> 00:22:54.56 bullets winding and splattering and I crouch lower to dodge them all I went with the rest my 16
00:22:54.56 --> 00:23:00.24 inch and field bayonet blade fixed and protruding at the ready ready ready for what the only thing I
00:23:00.24 --> 00:23:07.76 had ever stuck with a bayonet was a sack dummy then I saw them in the swirling smoke human beings
00:23:07.76 --> 00:23:15.84 not sacks real Germans blimey I trouched on wrenching my ankle in a pot hole on and on until the
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:25.52 order rang out charge charge I began to double now with my bayonet thrust at full on guard
00:23:25.52 --> 00:23:31.44 those figures growing bigger and bigger until they were just a few yards away among the din
00:23:31.44 --> 00:23:37.52 and yells of pain there were dead bodies from both sides littering my approach I was a foot from
00:23:37.52 --> 00:23:43.68 the two Germans went suddenly they both dropped their rifles and reached very high chattering
00:23:43.68 --> 00:23:50.56 something about comrad I was so bloody amazed and relieved that I said come on then I'll take you
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:58.08 prisoner which is just that paragraph for me to think through because I'm thinking when I see
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:03.76 those Germans you know what I'm doing I'm shooting them right I'm not going to continue with the
00:24:03.76 --> 00:24:14.000 bayonet charge right I'm not expecting to take these guys prisoner my battalion was now badly
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.68 cut up and he used the term cut up meaning shot up meaning wounded injured he used that throughout
00:24:19.68 --> 00:24:25.52 the book with numbers well below effective fighting power and we were ordered to attach ourselves to
00:24:25.52 --> 00:24:32.08 any unit and make our way to done Kirk though no reason was given and here I was stuck with two
00:24:32.08 --> 00:24:36.96 German prisoners the journey was nerve-racking with hordes of refugees jamming the roads and making
00:24:36.96 --> 00:24:42.64 military transport movement almost impossible lorries guns in French aged 39 hotchkes tanks were
00:24:42.64 --> 00:24:50.72 off and seen abandoned inditches rendered imoval but clearly not by enemy action what was going on
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:56.88 were we throwing in the towel so he's seen all these abandoned vehicles and they're being destroyed
00:24:56.88 --> 00:25:02.24 by friendly forces only because we don't want the enemy to get ahold of our tanks and he's
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:05.52 trying to figure out what's going on and obviously anyone that knows anything about history knows
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:12.96 that they're heading for done Kirk to leave the route was an absolute shambles with military
00:25:12.96 --> 00:25:17.12 and civilian gear constantly getting estranged rumors were plentiful now such as the story
00:25:17.12 --> 00:25:24.08 that leapled third of geard of Belgium and his army were capitulating towns all over France were falling
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:30.16 into enemy hands French general jiraud had been taken prisoner to pile on the agony the
00:25:30.16 --> 00:25:34.48 Germans not lit up on their bombing or machine gunning one bit and their slaughter of refugees was
00:25:34.48 --> 00:25:41.60 unnecessary and sickening to see we did what we could in the way of tending to civilian wounded
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:46.96 using their own clothing or bedding for bandages while their dead were either left covered
00:25:46.96 --> 00:25:52.32 left or covered with something to hide their torn bodies and agonized faces even cattle grazing
00:25:52.32 --> 00:25:57.60 in the fields had not escaped the bullets Craig and lay bloated through lack of milking or blown
00:25:57.60 --> 00:26:03.84 apart by shell fire the carnage spread for a good two miles after seeing those poor
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:09.20 wretched civilian so caught up my occasional wounded soldier the occasional wounded soldier did
00:26:09.20 --> 00:26:16.000 not seem quite so bad my two German prisoners appeared to be as disgusted by all of this as I was
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:21.52 and you're gonna see throughout this book the impression that he gets of the German as you
00:26:21.52 --> 00:26:30.40 could see that there's definitely a wide range of Germans that they encounter obviously some
00:26:30.40 --> 00:26:38.40 completely hostile but there's some that clearly are not are not totally engaged in the Nazi
00:26:39.28 --> 00:26:44.80 attitude and there's plenty there's it's very interesting to hear as he interacts with people throughout it
00:26:46.32 --> 00:26:50.72 continue on we reach the outskirts of Dunkirk to find a mass build up a French and British
00:26:50.72 --> 00:26:54.96 soldiers with transport tanks and artillery pieces jamming the roads like a London rush hour
00:26:56.96 --> 00:27:02.88 the next five days were a mixture of hell, hunger and fatigue and I think it was only thanks to
00:27:02.88 --> 00:27:08.88 the fatigue that I overcame the hell and the hunger I know it was five days because I put a
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:14.72 nick in my rifle butt each morning when roused by this visiting stucco's and mishrschmits so they're
00:27:14.72 --> 00:27:19.84 getting bombed and they're getting machine gunned every morning during daylight the appointed beach
00:27:19.84 --> 00:27:24.72 master a British officer mustard officers and NCOs from all regiments and brief them to organize
00:27:24.72 --> 00:27:31.04 parties of men to tend to wounded bury the dead and scavenge for ammunition and food I found it most
00:27:31.04 --> 00:27:38.08 distasteful removing tins of bully beef and biscuit remains from corpses but at least I still had my life
00:27:39.12 --> 00:27:44.08 the beach was littered with abandoned lorries and trucks as well as army staff cars with wheels
00:27:44.08 --> 00:27:49.44 missing and doors hanging off as I wandered around going about my task among these mutilated
00:27:49.44 --> 00:27:55.84 forms that were once carefree young men I remember thinking that I must be dreaming
00:27:57.76 --> 00:28:03.12 I was brought back to reality sharply by the appearance of two enemy fighter plans which proceeded
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:08.64 to distribute even more death in panic I dived over a corpse and slithered down a sand dune
00:28:08.64 --> 00:28:21.36 the staring eyes of the corpse saying to me get your head down and rs up after five days on the
00:28:21.36 --> 00:28:25.76 beaches it was a relief to find that it was finally my turn to get into the snake like line
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:33.04 of troops ready for departure as I drew closer to the vast mass of a ship a mine sweeper
00:28:33.04 --> 00:28:39.20 heaving in the mucky looking swell I could see it's multi-barrel attack gun porting skyward
00:28:39.20 --> 00:28:44.80 in readiness for any stucophyters or attack or fighter attack the operator seeming oblivious to
00:28:44.80 --> 00:28:49.68 our presence one was scanning the sky with his binoculars the water was by now was well and truly
00:28:49.68 --> 00:28:54.64 up to my neck and I still had 50 feet to go I clung the rope with both hands and pushed on
00:28:54.64 --> 00:28:59.92 the man behind gave me a shove the water kept lapping over my nose and into my eyes
00:28:59.92 --> 00:29:05.84 gulping choking and spitting out the endless mouthfuls of oily, foul tasting salt water I was
00:29:05.84 --> 00:29:11.20 now quite submerged with a last mighty effort I lunched in the direction of the boat still
00:29:11.20 --> 00:29:16.48 grasping at that rope I could not have been it could not have been more than a minute that I was
00:29:16.48 --> 00:29:21.52 underwater but it felt like a lifetime clinging on tight to the rope with my left hand with my
00:29:21.52 --> 00:29:26.56 right I grew up through the rope mesh hanging down the side of the ship and with great exaltation
00:29:26.56 --> 00:29:33.68 found and grabbed it I managed to pull myself up up up and up the ship rocking and heaving with
00:29:33.68 --> 00:29:38.08 each vibration of the exploding bombs which were arriving much too close for my liking
00:29:40.56 --> 00:29:44.56 so finally he's on board a ship and they're getting bombed and strafed flopping down
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:48.96 exhausted I was soon asleep though inevitably we had a visitor visit from a meshishment
00:29:48.96 --> 00:29:53.92 and this woke me violently as its bullets danced along the ship's deck causing large pieces
00:29:53.92 --> 00:29:59.92 of wood splinters to spew over everyone these administrators as much damage as the bullets to some
00:29:59.92 --> 00:30:06.88 unfortunate recipients I dosed off again and slept like a log until we docked in England
00:30:08.16 --> 00:30:14.64 so ended my participation with more than 300,000 others in operation dynamo better known as the
00:30:14.64 --> 00:30:21.44 history better known history as the miracle of Dunkirk so that's the way you kick things off
00:30:21.44 --> 00:30:27.36 with your with your war and I forget the time that passed and I know that the time that
00:30:27.36 --> 00:30:32.64 seemed to pass was very quick the way I just read it skipping a bunch of stuff but it was like
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:37.44 200 days that he was on the ground this was no hey I was there for a week no they were there
00:30:37.44 --> 00:30:44.000 moving forward fighting drawing back going on tack back and forth this whole time and you know that
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.48 could be you know just that experience right there could be a whole book and it yeah on into itself
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:56.24 right that's how that's how low key red skirt is is you know he was literally
00:30:56.24 --> 00:31:05.52 extracted off of Dunkirk after this entire campaign falls apart and he covers it in 20 pages
00:31:05.52 --> 00:31:17.76 not even 20 pages because he's getting warmed up so he gets home and he says they're followed
00:31:17.76 --> 00:31:23.60 two weeks of leave that I enjoyed more than ever before the sheer ecstasy of white sheets and
00:31:23.60 --> 00:31:31.20 pint after pint of beautiful beer and the days of roughing it in France seemed soon
00:31:31.20 --> 00:31:37.28 seemed very long ago yeah can you gotta you gotta think how hard it's like when you're going
00:31:37.28 --> 00:31:42.48 through basic seal training mm-hmm what they do is they I don't know how weak you've been awake
00:31:42.48 --> 00:31:47.44 for like two or three days and then they go hey they come up with this big story and they tell you
00:31:47.44 --> 00:31:52.32 that oh you're gonna we've we've kept you we were too hard on you guys we we have the the
00:31:52.32 --> 00:31:56.88 commanding officer just told us we got to we got to put you guys to sleep for eight hours so go get
00:31:56.88 --> 00:32:01.52 warm dry clothes on and we'll come back to you guys and we'll wake you up in eight hours and you're
00:32:01.52 --> 00:32:04.96 of course you believe it I mean back in the day we believed because we didn't know any better no
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:10.64 one gave us any heads up there was no in for intel network providing information there wasn't
00:32:10.64 --> 00:32:15.84 there wasn't like the movies about the stuff right so we just thought oh wow that seems
00:32:15.84 --> 00:32:21.28 kind of crazy but okay and then you get all dressed nice warm clothes and you're all dry and you go
00:32:21.28 --> 00:32:26.80 even go literally get in your bed and then as soon as you fall asleep like 20 minutes goes by
00:32:26.80 --> 00:32:31.28 and they're in there with machine guns and bull horns and they're waking you up so when you think
00:32:31.28 --> 00:32:37.04 about that's that's retiny right that's a tiny tiny little thing when you compare to what's going
00:32:37.04 --> 00:32:45.20 on here this guy goes to France starving like wounded and dead everywhere fear gets back to England
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:56.000 goes on leave for two weeks white sheets you know beer it's all good and then you know what's
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.52 gonna happen you're gonna go back so when you when they did that to you uh in was that hell
00:33:03.52 --> 00:33:10.48 week and they did okay so before there was before there was like a network right I say
00:33:10.48 --> 00:33:14.88 that and you said you believed it like one they say oh we put you right was there a part of
00:33:14.88 --> 00:33:20.000 you mine like or as far as part of the reason why you believed it it's because like they are pushing
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.68 you pretty hard at any point were you like hey they're pushing us too hard yeah actually I
00:33:25.68 --> 00:33:29.28 thought what you're gonna say is was there part of my mom and this would have been I would
00:33:29.28 --> 00:33:33.68 said yes was there part of my mind was like this is too good to be true this is nothing that's
00:33:33.68 --> 00:33:37.68 you know that that I would say the bigger part of my mind was saying that but I kind of was like
00:33:37.68 --> 00:33:43.28 oh I seems like a cool like they're they're telling us this right but no no before that though
00:33:43.76 --> 00:33:48.96 like at any point where they like I know hell or were you or whoever being like I know how
00:33:48.96 --> 00:33:54.40 weeks supposed to be hard but like this is kind of excessive like yeah I had no data on which to
00:33:54.40 --> 00:34:00.48 judge it right you know it's gonna be hard you know soccer no guy that quit buds and I said you know
00:34:00.48 --> 00:34:05.84 like why did you quit and he said because it sucked you know I said well didn't you know that
00:34:05.84 --> 00:34:09.68 it was gonna suck when you went there I mean that's where you're going like we all know it sucks
00:34:10.40 --> 00:34:15.28 go watch it a video you know and it's like it's gonna be it's gonna suck it's gonna be cold
00:34:15.28 --> 00:34:21.92 it's gonna be wet it's gonna be miserable it just feels like that yeah it's gonna suck like that
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.40 part but then you know like it goes sometimes in your brain anyway it'll go beyond sucked into like
00:34:26.40 --> 00:34:31.76 whether be dangerous I never felt like that no I was always like all this is this is just the
00:34:31.76 --> 00:34:36.24 training right okay then yeah then that makes sense that you could go to when they say oh yeah
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:40.24 here's a eight hour sleeper whatever you could go to well this might be too good to be true yeah like
00:34:40.24 --> 00:34:43.84 oh yeah so I'm saying what you're saying is you're sure that there's guys that were like yeah that's right
00:34:43.84 --> 00:34:48.16 yeah man of course way too hard and then those are the guys that when they get when the trick
00:34:48.16 --> 00:34:53.36 comes they get trapped brother devastated yeah devastated mentally devastated that's why it's one of the
00:34:53.36 --> 00:34:57.12 best things well not a lot you know there's a lot of people that don't get out of that bed
00:34:57.12 --> 00:35:02.16 right they don't get out of that bed because as soon as you get out you're going straight to the
00:35:02.16 --> 00:35:08.000 surf zone and people don't like that man I mean you can hear seals talk about it guys can
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.44 get scarred from liking the ocean for years man for years they they don't want to go in the water
00:35:15.44 --> 00:35:21.28 they don't want to do it because because they just they use it as an implementive torture
00:35:21.28 --> 00:35:28.72 me I didn't care you know like I surfed and it was all good you know let's go get some sort of
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:38.72 how back to the book so he's home he's taking a little time off he goes back and starts doing
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:46.000 kind of local let's call it like local guard type activities and then we get this in August I
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.68 received a telegram telling me that my home in south London had been hit by a sea mine and I was
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:58.000 given compassionate leave to return what the hell was a sea mine doing inland it must be a mistake I
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.76 thought however apparently there was such a thing which came down attached to a parachute so that's what
00:36:03.76 --> 00:36:12.72 the Nazis were doing and so he gets little leave to go and check things out and so he goes and here we
00:36:12.72 --> 00:36:17.76 go this is him finding his home upon reaching Grove Park as I turned into fairfield road I immediately saw
00:36:17.76 --> 00:36:22.40 that our house had received a direct hit there is now just a heap of debris where once it stood
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:28.80 half a dozen houses and dozens more were badly damaged the local ARP warden told me that not one
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:33.36 person had been killed because everyone had taken to their Anderson air raid shelters my parents were
00:36:33.36 --> 00:36:38.000 both okay and staying with some friends of mile of the road it was a shock to see our home destroyed
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.16 but after all I had seen in France I think I must have become immune to any real emotions
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:51.92 and then this happens in October as a result of a directive sent out by our prime minister
00:36:52.56 --> 00:36:58.08 Winston Churchill we received a letter which was read out to us by the regimental sergeant major
00:36:58.88 --> 00:37:06.08 volunteers he shouted for a new type of fighting soldier are required he glanced over the top of the
00:37:06.08 --> 00:37:14.16 paper BDI's registering some amusement soldiers he carried on to be trained as commandos and
00:37:14.16 --> 00:37:21.76 parachutists now I know that you would not wish to desert the regiment but anyone wishing to volunteer
00:37:22.40 --> 00:37:34.000 one-paced forward march glaring as he did so he took three stealthy steps towards us well
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:43.76 you all chicken then there was not a titer nor even a hesitant shuffle meaning everyone was just standing
00:37:43.76 --> 00:37:49.52 fast I fought back to the days in France I thought of a carnage of the British prisoners of war
00:37:49.52 --> 00:37:54.40 the warric regiment heard it into a field just outside Dunkirk and machine gun to death by the
00:37:54.40 --> 00:38:01.28 waffen SS I thought of my home being blown to smithereens and how the Germans were blocking my
00:38:01.28 --> 00:38:06.96 ambition to become a London policeman I took a pace forward before it was too late
00:38:11.20 --> 00:38:16.16 and some time passes as they try and get everything organized and then it continues on I was to
00:38:16.16 --> 00:38:22.48 join number two commando later renamed the 11th special air service battalion and still later
00:38:22.48 --> 00:38:28.56 the first parachute battalion in Britain at that time there was little no knowledge of the techniques
00:38:28.56 --> 00:38:32.72 of parachuting so everything had to be thought out very carefully there were no special types of
00:38:32.72 --> 00:38:37.52 parachutes for jumping from aircraft and no suitable aircraft the whole lot had to be devised
00:38:37.52 --> 00:38:46.56 developed and tested all too often with fatal casualties or severe injuries just learning how to
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:56.16 conduct parachute operations from scratch so they start their training and the training is
00:38:56.16 --> 00:39:04.72 is really really hard as you can imagine here we go now we settled down to some real soldiering
00:39:04.72 --> 00:39:09.92 and I actually begin to enjoy the tests thrust upon us I didn't realize it first that we were
00:39:09.92 --> 00:39:15.68 being used as human guinea pigs trying out new methods of roughing it and of delivering a soldier
00:39:15.68 --> 00:39:21.92 to the place of battle for everyone for everyone it was a taste test of strength involving
00:39:21.92 --> 00:39:30.64 guts sheer cunning and a determination to win some conditions were abominable but my conscious told
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:38.08 me that this was a challenge I must rise to and again this is when you got someone that's learning
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:53.60 through repetition how to take pain and suffering and do it in a way that is no factor
00:39:55.60 --> 00:40:01.52 jumping forward here through some training that they go through and all the training is just
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:06.80 it's a it's a guinea pigs right the training is just guinea pigs they're just doing crazy things
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:11.52 to these guys and then they do their first parachute jump get done with that within the next week
00:40:11.52 --> 00:40:16.16 our seven jumps had been achieved and we could not wait to sew those blue wings on the right arm
00:40:16.16 --> 00:40:22.24 of the battle's battle dressed blouse one laddy even brought his sewing kit along with him and sat
00:40:22.24 --> 00:40:28.40 down to the corner of the hanger to get them on before anyone else it was odd to see a man walking
00:40:28.40 --> 00:40:35.12 around in with and shot and manchester with their wings winged shoulders slightly forward of the
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:42.72 rest of their bodies civilians and other non parasolgers were asking who are these blocks with the wings
00:40:42.72 --> 00:40:50.000 some sort of secret unit that's not a little bit of unit pride right this is why
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.68 dichotomy of leadership when life and Seth disobeyed big jocco in what started wearing patches
00:40:59.68 --> 00:41:04.08 this is one of those things that you know I was thinking the back of my head like the if you're
00:41:04.08 --> 00:41:08.40 gonna if that makes you hold your chest out a little bit higher and you get that unit pride
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:17.44 I'm gonna let it slide continuing on we were training both as parachutes and also for the
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:23.60 specialized work of the commando which meant that a lot of extra work had to be put into achieve the
00:41:23.60 --> 00:41:33.92 very best end result above all above all it was emphasized it was emphatically stressed that we
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:39.92 should never accept defeat even when up against overwhelming odds and we were taught to persevere
00:41:39.92 --> 00:41:51.36 to the end and to be able to endure great if not impossible fatigue sound familiar that's what we do
00:41:53.68 --> 00:42:04.24 that's what we do in the military taught to persevere to the end and I guess that's so much of that is
00:42:04.24 --> 00:42:10.88 so much of that is what the we know how you're taught to do that because you do it because when you go
00:42:10.88 --> 00:42:17.52 to like sealtraining or whatever there's no class that says okay when you get tired think about this
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:23.44 no class that says that no class that says when you feel like you want to quit then you should think
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:28.88 about this or you should say this no if you're if that's where your head is at and you want to
00:42:28.88 --> 00:42:34.80 quit there's no they don't teach you anything to stop it what what you learn the way you're taught
00:42:34.80 --> 00:42:39.36 is by oh I'm gonna get through this that's what's gonna happen I'm gonna get through this
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:50.80 of course we have to learn a little bit about hand-to-hand combat we practice not only the use of
00:42:50.80 --> 00:42:58.000 the knife but also how to best avoid one when used against us Chinese experts taught us judo
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.48 and unarmed combat with a rifle and fixed bayonet we would be flung at you or sorry a rifle with
00:43:04.48 --> 00:43:08.96 fixed bayonet would be flung at you by the instructor who yell come on lunge it me I
00:43:10.08 --> 00:43:16.64 lunged hesitantly for the first time come on long shanks lunge you won't get anywhere near me
00:43:17.28 --> 00:43:22.64 right made I thought you asked for it and I took a really good lunge but this man was an old hand
00:43:22.64 --> 00:43:27.28 like lightning he paired my blow and before I knew it I was flat on my back minus the rifle
00:43:28.48 --> 00:43:33.68 it was the same with the fighting knife and quite a few of us nursed cuts at the end of a
00:43:33.68 --> 00:43:42.88 day's training those knives were razor sharp just called real world in April of 1941 we were visited
00:43:42.88 --> 00:43:51.68 by Winston Churchill accompanied by Sir Arthur Barrett and Major General Sir Hastings is May and he goes
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:57.36 he actually go I'm not going to tell the whole story but there's a one point where where reds has a
00:43:57.36 --> 00:44:05.68 little very short conversation with Winston Churchill and basically he's he's redges the receiver
00:44:05.68 --> 00:44:12.24 on a dison like a hand-to-hand combat display and he ends up getting from you know like a hip toss
00:44:12.24 --> 00:44:20.16 I'm imagining and and when he's done and he's gonna get him up off the ground and in Winston Churchill
00:44:20.16 --> 00:44:28.56 looks at him and says uh did you really try lad and and reds looks at him and says what do you
00:44:28.56 --> 00:44:36.08 bloody think sir and then he said Winston Churchill purses lips gave a big grin and waddled off looking
00:44:36.08 --> 00:44:44.80 delighted so that's pretty awesome interaction with Winston Churchill who by the way we haven't even
00:44:44.80 --> 00:44:51.44 we haven't even started to get into the Winston Churchill scene here on the podcast but you know it's
00:44:51.44 --> 00:45:00.000 covered you know it's covered and and that'll be I'm sure many podcasts and this is a little glimpse
00:45:01.44 --> 00:45:08.56 into the future continuing on bypassing usual military procedure various on orthodox methods
00:45:08.56 --> 00:45:13.76 and the use of small arms explosives were adopted and official eyes were shut so long as the end of
00:45:13.76 --> 00:45:20.24 the jaw and result was achieved one such stunt was with draw the safety pin from a hand grenade
00:45:20.24 --> 00:45:25.52 release the arm which we call the spoon release the arm which in turn would fire the four
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:31.20 second fuse in the prime grenade making it really live hold it for a second and then throw it
00:45:31.20 --> 00:45:36.24 quickly the object being to make sure the enemy would have no time to throw it back and he won't
00:45:36.24 --> 00:45:42.72 refusing this dangerous venture would be subject to a variety of flowery names luckily we had no
00:45:42.72 --> 00:45:48.40 casualties to result and what makes that scariest so grenade as a four second fuse when you pull we
00:45:48.40 --> 00:45:54.000 are holding something that what do they call the arm it actually fits into the web of your hand this
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.64 this this piece of like light aluminum and you when you put it in the web of your hand and then
00:46:00.64 --> 00:46:06.48 you hold the grenade that thing is stuck in place now you then you next thing you do is you pull the pin
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:11.44 because when the pin's in there that arm doesn't go anywhere because it's spring loaded as soon as
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:17.44 you pull the pin that there's tension on the spring that's ready to make that spoon or arm fly off and
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:24.72 that's what arms it to blow up in four seconds the problem is is that the fuse is aren't perfect
00:46:25.84 --> 00:46:32.80 so depending on the fuse that you get could be could be three seconds could be six seconds
00:46:32.80 --> 00:46:38.32 could be four seconds like it's supposed to be is there a possibility it's two seconds yes there is
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:44.24 so when you cook we call it cooking it off so when you cook off that grenade there's a possibility
00:46:45.20 --> 00:46:52.96 that it goes off but if you don't cook it off at all and you throw it
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:56.40 and you can throw it back you're especially if it's four seconds and one of their choices
00:46:56.40 --> 00:46:59.92 they can either jump on it they can dive away or they can grab it throw it back if they think you
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:05.04 haven't cooked it back well best thing do is get it out of there remember T Fred Harvey the
00:47:05.04 --> 00:47:17.60 he's getting grenade tossing fights with the Japanese so as this training is going on also
00:47:17.60 --> 00:47:22.88 we have to remember there's the mental fortitude part there's the tactical training but we can't
00:47:22.88 --> 00:47:28.32 ever forget just physically be in hard to keep on top form we had plenty of physical training cross
00:47:28.32 --> 00:47:36.64 country runs compass marches and night exercises discipline was self-imposed and any need to impose
00:47:36.64 --> 00:47:44.64 it by a superior was found upon yes that's what we want we don't want to we don't want to have to
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:49.04 impose discipline run about in leadership strategy tactics that's not the if you have to impose
00:47:49.04 --> 00:47:54.64 discipline some strong then you're a strong your leadership is wrong because if you're leading correctly
00:47:54.64 --> 00:48:00.24 the troops will put discipline on themselves they will they will acquire self-discipline because
00:48:00.24 --> 00:48:08.32 they understand why it's important psychological and physical resistance were driven to the
00:48:08.32 --> 00:48:15.04 utmost until men could take their limit and even more but it was never enough we were marched counter
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:21.12 marched and marched again in fair weather and in foul live ammunition fired at close range actually
00:48:21.12 --> 00:48:25.68 helped I found myself so preoccupied with making sure I did not get hit but I became oblivious
00:48:25.68 --> 00:48:30.56 to fatigue and plotted on at the end of the day's training I would stretch out on the hangar
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:36.80 for absolutely shagged on passing sergeant Sid Oxley might prod me and say something like
00:48:37.36 --> 00:48:46.64 not bad lad not bad do better tomorrow eh get stuffed was the usual quiet reply as I slipped
00:48:46.64 --> 00:48:54.64 a well earned cigarette between my lips and drew hard so there's a pretty good chunk of this
00:48:54.64 --> 00:49:00.08 training in there and again all this training was they just created this they just created that
00:49:00.08 --> 00:49:08.80 this was new where like we're making up and props one thing when I look at the course of my entire life
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:14.72 there's like a couple moments in time where things made an impression on me and one of the things
00:49:14.72 --> 00:49:20.56 that made an impression on me as a little kid was I had these toy soldiers I had a lot of toy
00:49:20.56 --> 00:49:30.000 soldiers but the British commandos from World War II they had little ladders they had little
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.88 grappling hooks they had boats and they had beanies right you know what I'm talking about I
00:49:38.88 --> 00:49:44.56 when you're a little you don't know what a beanie is I know a beanie is yeah okay we you know when you see a stereotypical
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:51.52 like let's say a robber in a movie and they're sneaking around and they're wearing a black beanie
00:49:52.08 --> 00:49:57.68 I think that all stems from the British commandos so for me when I saw like those little
00:49:57.68 --> 00:50:04.16 care it was a little soldiers that I had with black beanies and rubber rafts that look like Zodiacs
00:50:04.16 --> 00:50:11.76 they also had a little kayak for them too and I think all seeing those things I was always drawn
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:19.28 to the maritime component of special operations interesting hey I want to be the close what's the
00:50:19.28 --> 00:50:23.68 close thing I can be to a British commando I see these guys with boats and and the weird thing is I mean
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:30.56 that's that's not what these guys were doing and in fact and I didn't say this red red
00:50:30.56 --> 00:50:35.04 Curtis didn't know how to swim that's why he was so scared and he didn't he doesn't say it until
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:39.44 he later in the book that's why he was so scared at Dunkirk that's why he's talking about how he's
00:50:39.44 --> 00:50:42.64 underwater there's nothing he can do about he's hanging around the rope because he does know how to swim
00:50:42.64 --> 00:50:48.88 and he's weighted down oh yeah but yeah the the British commandos which I'm sure will broke off
00:50:48.88 --> 00:50:57.04 from the parachute guys but that's kind of a major a major influence on a whatever six year old kid
00:50:57.04 --> 00:51:03.44 yeah I don't remember any well then again I guess I wasn't into the toy soldiers element
00:51:04.24 --> 00:51:09.12 yeah you were just getting like the regular big green toy soldiers from like the the grocery store
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:15.28 right yeah yeah army men for sure I had NGJL I graduated from
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:24.16 playing green army men two legit little soldiers that came from different units and I had all these
00:51:24.16 --> 00:51:29.52 different units and I knew what kind of gear they had with them I had the Africa core right
00:51:29.52 --> 00:51:35.36 the Nazi Africa core and again the ones that stand out were the ones that had like looked a little bit
00:51:35.36 --> 00:51:39.52 different the Africa core guys were canned instead of green the British commandos were green
00:51:40.72 --> 00:51:47.52 I had I had pair troopers they were these they were little army men just they were smaller than the
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:52.16 regular army men smaller yeah they were small they were I think I think there are no main
00:51:52.16 --> 00:51:57.52 cladiers of one thirty second I think they were really small they were you know a half an inch tall
00:51:57.52 --> 00:52:01.92 maybe and maybe a three quarters of an inch tall and they still had individual soldier that bottom
00:52:01.92 --> 00:52:08.24 platform that little bottom platform huh and I would set up battle scenes you know out in the yard
00:52:08.88 --> 00:52:15.44 and play by play the way things were unfolding yeah you probably went deep though I'm like you know
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:21.52 on the regular army men set man set the guy who's crawling in the little crawl guy yeah yeah
00:52:21.52 --> 00:52:26.88 like he would be flying sometimes in my own scenario yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:52:26.88 --> 00:52:32.40 he could be in that flying position well I had that I had the model planes who I also had a
00:52:32.40 --> 00:52:39.92 teacher named Mr. McGurk in high school and he had a little army he had little planes all throughout
00:52:39.92 --> 00:52:45.60 his room the classroom hanging you know model little model planes model planes I had model planes too
00:52:45.60 --> 00:52:51.68 because it was all trying to make un-make this battle scenario and the weird thing is
00:52:52.72 --> 00:52:58.16 the weird thing is about this stuff is like okay if my son let's face it if my son has army
00:52:58.16 --> 00:53:02.48 soldiers we kind of expect that just to be normal right like hey of course I mean by the time
00:53:02.48 --> 00:53:07.68 that kid was born he had more soldiers than you know I'd do with yeah but there's some instinctual
00:53:07.68 --> 00:53:15.44 thing even you you are like back in Kauai right there's no I mean your mom wasn't
00:53:15.44 --> 00:53:19.68 saying hey I really want you to be interested in military stuff right and yet you had green
00:53:19.68 --> 00:53:24.000 army soldiers yes and even though some of them could fly which was a little bit unrealistic
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.40 some of them were still low crawling right some of them were engaging in battle against other
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:36.88 soldiers well yeah so you have an instinct for war yes and I think most just like I talked earlier
00:53:36.88 --> 00:53:42.96 about the instinct for like hey I'm part of something bigger than me which is a beautiful thing
00:53:42.96 --> 00:53:47.60 if you think about it right that's a beautiful thing like I am part of this group that I'm
00:53:48.32 --> 00:53:54.64 I'm subordinate to this group as a powerful thing and it has to be countered correctly because
00:53:54.64 --> 00:54:02.16 you don't want to be someone that gets brainwashed and joins a cult right the the Bhagwan Shri Raj
00:54:02.16 --> 00:54:10.000 Nish cult sir right you don't want to be that person no no yeah that is weird now that you mentioned
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.20 that like yet it would call it an instinct for a instinct for war like I think because it's it's
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:22.000 so common like consider like G. I just okay I'll say this scenario so we we had a we're my dad
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.44 built their house and he well he was one of the people who built our house so when we're digging the
00:54:28.64 --> 00:54:34.000 cesspool it's like me skeptical septic tank septic tank I guess it's like a huge hole
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.40 okay super deep anyway they put the cap on it okay um this big concrete cap on it okay and then they
00:54:40.40 --> 00:54:46.16 fill it in and then but as it remains is still a big hole like the size of a jacuzzi okay about
00:54:46.16 --> 00:54:52.16 that size but it's just a dirt hole okay it's weird it's like a it literally like a dug in jacuzzi
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:58.32 in dirt so I'm not sure what this is but going yeah that's just the way it it's sorted itself out okay
00:54:58.32 --> 00:55:05.28 um so it sounds like a foxhole yeah you don't recall it that yeah but um for and then it
00:55:05.28 --> 00:55:11.52 it rained I'm quite rains pretty much every day yeah yeah no no no so it's storming but
00:55:11.52 --> 00:55:19.12 enough to put a cool little shallow puddle in the bottom of that and mud so we're in a muddy terrain
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:25.52 scenario G. I. Joe yeah why is so we got hills we got the top of the hill we got the valleys
00:55:25.52 --> 00:55:30.96 the you know the water scenario at the bottom and oh yeah it was like battles going on the whole
00:55:30.96 --> 00:55:36.24 time we'd like stuff on fire and your dad was no military experience your mom was no military
00:55:36.24 --> 00:55:42.32 experience your neighbors my grandfather was at a D day but I did know that yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:55:42.32 --> 00:55:51.20 that's right salute but I had no idea at this point obviously but but unless we're still doing it
00:55:51.20 --> 00:55:55.76 G. I. Joe's good guys versus bad guys killing like you know you could take up on the part of the
00:55:55.76 --> 00:55:59.36 G. I. Joe's like you could blow them all with fire crackers and then bury them and like do all
00:55:59.36 --> 00:56:04.32 this stuff you should have a very serious stuff oh yeah you were going deep yeah big time
00:56:04.32 --> 00:56:11.04 catching the whole dramatic and it's not like someone like told me to tell that and how much
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:17.84 how much did you see how many warm movies had you seen on TV even remember I don't remember but
00:56:17.84 --> 00:56:24.40 you know you could I mean this is what like 80s we'll say like 90s maybe there's some 18 going on
00:56:24.40 --> 00:56:30.40 18 and watch it not like religious anything so it's just we're talking to instinct that's the
00:56:30.40 --> 00:56:34.72 bottom yeah I did I mean mash was on I don't think I'd ever watch mash that's more than comedy though
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:41.52 that's not like a but yeah it's kind of a comedy if you if you watch that show it's actually
00:56:41.52 --> 00:56:46.96 in many ways there's some pretty heavy episodes of mash for oh actually because I remember watching
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:52.80 it when I was a kid and there's definitely I remember watching that movie going oh watching that show
00:56:52.80 --> 00:56:57.28 sometimes and you ever in suspecting the laugh but then sometimes it would be super heavy because
00:56:57.28 --> 00:57:06.96 they would occasionally inject war yeah yeah right and yeah so yeah so I think there's just an
00:57:06.96 --> 00:57:14.08 instinct that people can have at some level and I think obviously just like instinct of
00:57:14.08 --> 00:57:18.64 being something bigger than yourself that's an instinct that people can have at different levels right
00:57:18.64 --> 00:57:24.48 not everyone's a 10 in hey I want to be part of a group that's bigger than me not everyone not everyone is
00:57:24.48 --> 00:57:28.000 in fact I I would say maybe you don't even want to be a 10 because then you're just looking for a
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.12 cult of joint right next thing you know you're buying a guy rolls Royces which is what you got to watch
00:57:35.12 --> 00:57:38.96 out for right so we're not looking to do that same thing with the war like instinct right there's
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:42.64 some people that are pretty high up on that I believe I was pretty pretty high up on that because
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:48.80 I don't remember wanting to do other things right so like when I thought about my future as a child
00:57:48.80 --> 00:57:55.76 the thought was be a soldier like that's what I remember be a commando that's what I remember
00:57:56.32 --> 00:58:01.36 so it's you know it's something that and I'm sure there's a bunch of other you know like a
00:58:01.36 --> 00:58:07.36 a fatherly instinct right or a motherly instinct or uh here's another interesting one
00:58:07.36 --> 00:58:11.52 some people like to travel right so people want to move around a lot some people want to stay home
00:58:11.52 --> 00:58:16.64 there's like different levels of instincts that people have some people want to settle down and hold
00:58:16.64 --> 00:58:23.28 what you got some people don't want to do that at all so people have various instincts so
00:58:24.56 --> 00:58:31.28 I would say that what they did in this training is hone the instincts that people did have
00:58:31.28 --> 00:58:37.04 and get rid of people that didn't have enough of the instinct for war and you know once again
00:58:37.04 --> 00:58:41.60 talking about seal training they're not really teaching you anything they're just getting rid of
00:58:41.60 --> 00:58:47.20 people that don't have the right instinct yeah that's what they're really doing they're not teaching
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:55.60 anything you learn only because you learn from your experience but it's not an active teaching
00:58:56.24 --> 00:59:00.72 protocol yeah that's it so do you what do you think do you think that that's like
00:59:01.52 --> 00:59:05.52 good like is that and of course I'm gonna say is it the best way because we know it's the best way
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:09.44 but is that kind of the best way to do it because it kind of seems like it could be the best way to
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:14.16 do it like it's definitely it's definitely you're not gonna get neat well not you're gonna minimize
00:59:14.16 --> 00:59:20.32 the amount of stray voltage don't you kind of want to work with someone that has a higher instinct
00:59:20.32 --> 00:59:26.000 for winning yeah then someone that's got to be coaxed and trained yeah exactly what I'm saying
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.36 that's what it seems like that's why it seems like it's a pretty good thing to me yeah it's almost
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:33.76 like what you rather have on your football team someone that I think about this think about
00:59:33.76 --> 00:59:37.60 you're the who's the person that brings people onto the team it's not the coach but like the
00:59:37.60 --> 00:59:42.96 GM I don't know so let's say you're in control of a football team and you're gonna take this
00:59:42.96 --> 00:59:47.76 thing as far as you can this is your only job do you want the guy that you get that you have to
00:59:47.76 --> 00:59:54.000 train a bunch to get him to be able to run a fast for fast 40 or do you want a guy that comes
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.40 out of the gate and he's kind of already there right this is the no-brainer of course now there are
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:07.04 outliers that I actually want this guy that was slow but he's such a hard worker and a grinder
01:00:07.04 --> 01:00:11.60 that he's gonna excel anyways like I want that guy and guess what see what training does that you
01:00:11.60 --> 01:00:15.84 know if you're a gazelle and you're really great athlete it doesn't test you as much as the guy
01:00:15.84 --> 01:00:20.56 that's a grinder yeah but the guy that's a really great athlete has a little bit more value
01:00:20.56 --> 01:00:24.16 out of the gate than the guy that's a grinder once you show up at the team though you want the
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:29.04 guy that's a grinder more than you want the guy that's a good athlete right yeah so almost like
01:00:29.04 --> 01:00:33.12 it's all sort of and that's not a guarantee every time because there's some guys that were
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.24 freaking great athletes and they were just incredible so don't don't take that one wrong but
01:00:39.04 --> 01:00:45.92 necessarily a guy that's a great athlete versus a guy that is just has can gut through it
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:52.56 probably I would lean towards the guy that can gut through it because he has a level of grit
01:00:53.12 --> 01:00:57.44 you're not you don't face a pull-up bar out in the battlefield right you're not you don't you know
01:00:57.44 --> 01:01:02.80 it's not there yeah and then and that makes sense I mean it's all kind of in the same bucket
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:07.52 really but where like these are just attributes right so how does life put it he'll say um
01:01:08.80 --> 01:01:14.40 buds is just a screening process to weed out people who we don't think have the characteristics
01:01:14.40 --> 01:01:19.68 to be successful on the battlefield which is a very eloquent way of putting it eloquent so those
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:25.12 characteristics aren't necessarily who can do the most pull-ups it's not that because look if you're
01:01:25.12 --> 01:01:29.20 doing like there's a minimum though right obviously like you have to do a certain amount of
01:01:29.20 --> 01:01:34.32 minimum is so minimum to like get to buds the minimum is so minimum it should be disqualifying
01:01:34.32 --> 01:01:38.48 if you can actually only do that many right not kidding the minimum pull-ups go to buds is something
01:01:38.48 --> 01:01:44.40 like 10 right tiny it's ridiculous yeah so just like how you said it's like okay we haven't
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:51.20 we have a minimum and that's sort of it so who cares if you can do 50 who cares really
01:01:51.20 --> 01:01:57.20 we care about other stuff yeah well there's a well-rounded component right and and that's what
01:01:57.20 --> 01:02:02.16 makes that's the thing that makes the seal training hard is you can't just be a fast runner
01:02:02.72 --> 01:02:10.16 you can't just be a fast swimmer you can't just be strong upper body you can't just be comfortable
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:18.72 in the water you can't just be durable you gotta be all those things and what's hard is they're
01:02:18.72 --> 01:02:26.56 contrary to each other right because being able to run 14 miles is one type of person that's
01:02:26.56 --> 01:02:32.16 going to be really good at that being able to get through the obstacle course is another person
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:35.68 that has a lot of upper body strength this person has a lot of endurance this person have
01:02:35.68 --> 01:02:40.48 and then you add in hey you need to be able to pick up your body and sprint with them over the
01:02:40.48 --> 01:02:47.12 burn that's explosiveness so we want this really kind of middle of the road on a bunch of different
01:02:47.12 --> 01:02:53.60 things well-rounded as opposed to someone that's just really good at one particular thing and
01:02:53.60 --> 01:02:58.72 there's all kinds of people that show up that are great athletes in one category and it does a
01:02:58.72 --> 01:03:05.12 work for yes so that the attribute of all the attributes that attribute about the guy who can
01:03:05.12 --> 01:03:10.88 gut through stuff sort of lifts up all those attributes if didn't it not that high so let's say
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:18.48 that's the main one then yes yes you want the guy who that comes naturally to rather than the guy who
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:26.56 it might they're teaching may falter later I want that to be part of you makes sense part of you
01:03:26.56 --> 01:03:31.84 and man what a good quality to have that's the thing that's that's the thing people look we
01:03:31.84 --> 01:03:38.16 ever want to get to certain amount of talent you can decide to work hard you can decide to work
01:03:38.16 --> 01:03:44.56 hard now now there are people that say that work ethic is a talent right I get that concept
01:03:45.28 --> 01:03:50.64 and I think the reason it appears to be that way is because you get people that work so hard
01:03:50.64 --> 01:03:56.000 that you think oh that must be a talent of theirs right to have this talent that you're going to work
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.28 so hard I don't I well I think that you have well you do you have way more influence over that
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:09.92 talent than you do over your explosive strengths yeah I mean infinitely more yeah because you can't I don't
01:04:09.92 --> 01:04:16.88 know the of the seminal genetics expert but I don't know that there's a gene or a series of genes
01:04:16.88 --> 01:04:24.40 that gives you work ethic yeah I would say the answers no right I mean not not all right I mean we
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:31.68 could check with the bro science like schools on that one yeah those but they're I bet you know when
01:04:31.68 --> 01:04:35.20 they start breaking down this genetic stuff they're going to start finding stuff about people that's
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:38.96 going to be really interesting and some of it will be tight I mean I'm not going to say I'm Harris
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:46.32 you know you're every decision that you make is kind of pre-plan free will but you know I'm
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:51.36 sure Sam and I will have a chance to sit down if he has the courage to step up to the plates
01:04:51.36 --> 01:05:00.24 and have a real conversation with me but but I bet as this stuff gets uncovered they will find
01:05:00.24 --> 01:05:07.92 that there's a propensity like a propensity for focus yeah because that's what hard work is kind of
01:05:08.32 --> 01:05:15.52 is just hey look like when I was going to college and I would get to I would do one semester I took
01:05:15.52 --> 01:05:23.68 five English classes the dumbest thing I've ever done I would be so crushed with reading over you
01:05:23.68 --> 01:05:27.92 know during the week but then on the weekend would come and I'd have to read five English
01:05:27.92 --> 01:05:33.36 classes worth of reading and that was when I would be like okay I would have to like turn the
01:05:33.36 --> 01:05:41.04 switch in my head and just go fall on sit there and read for 10 hours and read and remember what I
01:05:41.04 --> 01:05:48.48 was reading so that was a switch it was like oh and I remember thinking myself I'd be talking to
01:05:48.48 --> 01:05:53.76 other people that had one English class and they'd say I'd say they said did you do the reading
01:05:53.76 --> 01:05:56.40 can you tell me what happened and I'd be like yeah of course I did the reading and they'd be like
01:05:56.40 --> 01:06:00.80 I cannot sit down and read for that long and I'd be like no hey you don't care
01:06:01.44 --> 01:06:07.84 be you like discipline see maybe I've got a little propensity to be able to turn it on or
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:12.96 maybe it just through force of will look I want to get an A in this class why because
01:06:14.32 --> 01:06:17.76 because I don't want these instructors looking at me thinking that they got a little
01:06:17.76 --> 01:06:23.44 sunk mommy no you don't got anything on me I'll read this material and I'll know it
01:06:23.44 --> 01:06:29.92 yeah and all that it all that right there is it's so you do just so everyone realizes I'm not crazy
01:06:29.92 --> 01:06:34.56 that's just gamification that's just gamification in my head to make things fun to make things
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:38.40 challenging right I'll do that with anything all day long you if I've got something to do I'm
01:06:38.40 --> 01:06:44.64 gonna have a good time with it yeah we're gonna have a good time with it I'm fine so when you hear me
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:51.68 you know I was watching someone Larry Bird and he was this he's famous for talking trash
01:06:51.68 --> 01:06:58.16 to all the other players and but he works so hard he was also famous for his work ethic
01:06:59.36 --> 01:07:03.36 but I think there's a little bit of gamification right when you go I'm gonna do this to you I'm
01:07:03.36 --> 01:07:08.08 gonna do like he would come down the court be any you he'd say like he'd say uh the here comes
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:12.32 three who wants it meaning come and try and guard me I'm gonna hit a three pointer and he would do it
01:07:12.32 --> 01:07:17.60 yeah you know there's a little bit of gamification people respond well that so that's me
01:07:17.60 --> 01:07:21.60 when I was going to college as a 28 year old man by the way I'm not talking I was an 18 year old
01:07:21.60 --> 01:07:27.12 kid all worried about how I looked and what the party well I'm worried about any of that yeah
01:07:27.12 --> 01:07:32.80 I was in there to win and in order to win I made it into a game for myself yeah oh you think you're
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:36.56 gonna ask me you think that you're gonna come up with a question on this reading material that you
01:07:36.56 --> 01:07:41.20 gave me that I'm not gonna go to the answer to watch this so that way I'm actually banded tension
01:07:41.20 --> 01:07:47.20 actually paying attention what's going on as opposed to I don't care doesn't really matter
01:07:47.20 --> 01:07:50.88 I'm in the navy anyways who cares what I get for a grade ball ball ball ball ball I could make
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:54.88 those excuses all day you can always take the easy path if you want to it's always there
01:07:55.44 --> 01:08:00.32 but you just gotta remember that it leads downhill and if you take the righteous path well
01:08:00.32 --> 01:08:08.16 then you're gonna move in the right direction yeah but it still seems like you got all those
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:14.40 methods we'll say like from you know like you weren't born with that you know kind of thing
01:08:14.40 --> 01:08:20.80 you know it seems like you know you got yes it does see it seems like it's a choice that I make
01:08:20.80 --> 01:08:26.96 well and it seems also like where you like what you learned along the way what right how that's
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:32.32 what what lessons got reinforced you know what lessons got reinforced for me if I don't work hard I'll
01:08:32.32 --> 01:08:37.28 lose yeah that lesson got reinforced I'm the over and over and over again if I don't work hard I'll
01:08:37.28 --> 01:08:47.76 lose if I work hard I can do better I might not win but I can do better and I'll tell you something else
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:53.12 if your attitude is like if your attitude is only I'm gonna win like that's why I'm doing this
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:58.88 you're not gonna win every time but let me tell you what your attitude can be I might not win
01:08:58.88 --> 01:09:06.80 every time but I'm gonna get your respect yeah you when you get done beating me when you get done
01:09:06.80 --> 01:09:12.64 beating me and you shake my hand you're gonna mean it because you you had you you're gonna mean it
01:09:12.64 --> 01:09:17.04 I'm gonna push you at a minimum that's what's happening so if you beat me and by the way I don't
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:21.92 hold it against you when you beat me I respect if you beat me I know you worked I know you got I know
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:28.32 you got after which is cool and I don't I don't held any angst whatsoever it's good actually
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:33.92 because I know that this guy worked hard with me and I know I got to work even harder so good for you
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:41.20 so that's that comes that's learned that's me learning as a kid oh I wasn't good at this
01:09:41.20 --> 01:09:46.72 and even I looked back in my life now like I wasn't great at soccer I never played soccer outside
01:09:46.72 --> 01:09:51.44 the soccer season other kids are running around dribble in the soccer ball whatever going to camp
01:09:52.48 --> 01:09:59.28 whatever I didn't didn't care enough didn't we didn't understand the first thing that I got well
01:09:59.28 --> 01:10:04.000 I got very focused in the sealed teams and in the sealed teams because you're going to get
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.84 high caliber people not all of them but you got some people to top of the bell curve that are
01:10:07.84 --> 01:10:12.72 freaking bad asses and if you're if for me so I got these incredible athletes you know when I
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:17.04 checked in a sealed team one I'm gonna try and think this was probably 10 of us went to
01:10:17.04 --> 01:10:21.84 sealed team one a pretty good chunk of you guys went to sealed team one there was some guys in
01:10:21.84 --> 01:10:30.56 that went to sealed team one that were total athletic studs I mean infinitely better than me
01:10:30.56 --> 01:10:36.24 and every category of athleticism you know and I knew like okay if I'm gonna hang with these guys
01:10:36.24 --> 01:10:41.68 I'm gonna have to work really really hard just to hang with just to hang with not to beat them
01:10:42.40 --> 01:10:49.52 just to hang with them so that idea gets reinforced over time okay if I don't work hard I'll be at the
01:10:49.52 --> 01:10:54.80 bottom of the barrel and and then what it boils down to if I'm at the bottom of the barrel how much
01:10:54.80 --> 01:11:02.08 am I helping with team because if I'm a if I'm a detriment to the team now now what am I
01:11:02.08 --> 01:11:06.88 even doing with my life right I do not want to be a detriment to the team I want to be a
01:11:06.88 --> 01:11:10.88 positive to the team and even though I might not be the best guy in the pollton I might not be the
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:16.88 strongest the fastest the best shot whatever those things are if I'm third or fourth or fifth in
01:11:16.88 --> 01:11:23.12 some of those categories okay well now I'm a benefit to the team now I can help which is what
01:11:23.12 --> 01:11:29.12 it all boils down to and what it all boils down to is like you know you can make an excuse for yourself
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:38.72 and live with it a little bit but you can't make an excuse for the team meaning hey look even in
01:11:38.72 --> 01:11:42.64 extreme case well you know if I'm not that great of a shot and the enemy gets a shot off
01:11:42.64 --> 01:11:48.16 quicker than me oh well I'm gonna die that's the that's the job of got that's the choice of you
01:11:48.16 --> 01:11:53.04 know whatever but if you just play that out one step further if I don't get this shot off
01:11:53.04 --> 01:11:57.68 this guy will have the chance to shoot one of my buddies that's you need to put more rounds down
01:11:57.68 --> 01:12:02.56 range you need to shoot more you need to get better and faster fast run your reloads fast run your
01:12:02.56 --> 01:12:05.52 draw faster in your side picture that's what you need to get better because you don't let your
01:12:05.52 --> 01:12:10.56 teammates down yeah so when that's what's really driving you that's powerful that's more powerful
01:12:10.56 --> 01:12:15.92 than I just want to be the best I don't want to just be the best because you can give yourself a little
01:12:15.92 --> 01:12:21.04 slack in there but when you look at it you say oh I don't want to let my teammates down they're
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:28.72 counting on me that will make you stay up later that will make you wake up earlier that will drive
01:12:28.72 --> 01:12:35.44 you to try and be better and that lesson that lesson on me got reinforced over and over again
01:12:35.44 --> 01:12:41.36 and if I didn't work hard then I wouldn't be I failed something in Buds called pool competency
01:12:43.04 --> 01:12:50.000 and I should I to fail it right and I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it and the reason
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.96 I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it was because I was comfortable in the water I
01:12:52.96 --> 01:12:58.56 done all the water stuff kind of first time every time meaning not tying in life saving I was good
01:12:58.56 --> 01:13:05.36 I felt really comfortable and so when I failed it I was sort of I was deeply disappointed
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:10.64 that I failed it and I was hyper worried that maybe I'm not gonna make it through this training
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.96 and so we mean a couple of the other guys that failed we spent the entire weekend
01:13:17.68 --> 01:13:23.60 in the dip tank which is the little box that you fill with water to clean stuff in
01:13:24.24 --> 01:13:29.76 and I don't even know why the instructor's lettuce he was dive gear I have no idea why this was not safe
01:13:30.56 --> 01:13:34.96 and maybe we just did it I don't really remember but we got in this dip tank and we
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:40.64 did pool comp to each other for hours and we just ripped the stuff off and ripped you know
01:13:40.64 --> 01:13:45.28 crossed each other until we went through the procedure so many times when I went to retake pool
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:52.000 comp it was it was easy it was easy when I went to retake it on Monday so what what lesson got reinforced
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:57.36 I need to prepare more I need to work harder I need to go to the extra distance or else I can fail
01:13:57.92 --> 01:14:02.32 so there's another little reinforcement I told you this one before I failed the run in seal training
01:14:02.32 --> 01:14:08.08 why did I fail run I failed the run in seal training because I paced myself and said well you
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:13.92 know I'll save a little something and I didn't have anything to save what I needed to do was run as hard as I could
01:14:14.96 --> 01:14:20.32 so I failed the run when I paced myself the next run what did I do when that when they said go
01:14:20.32 --> 01:14:24.88 I ran as fast as I could for the entire thing because you're not allowed to wear a watch so you have no idea
01:14:24.88 --> 01:14:30.40 what the time is you just and so you think about that you think about when you're cruising on a run versus
01:14:30.40 --> 01:14:34.72 when you're running as hard as you can it's hard to tell where that cruise level's at because
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:40.000 am I running am I running a six minute mile if I'm cruising am I running a six thirdier
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.20 or am I running a seven twenty it can be hard to judge especially when you're sore like your
01:14:45.20 --> 01:14:52.08 your body sore so you know if you did if you did 500 eight count body builders at three o'clock in the
01:14:52.08 --> 01:14:57.60 morning and then you go out and you run your run your pace you might seem like you're running faster
01:14:57.60 --> 01:15:03.92 than you really are so when I learned from that I failed the run and now what I have to do I've
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:08.64 realized I can never let off again can ever so there's a little lesson getting reinforced
01:15:09.44 --> 01:15:13.76 over and over and over again don't leave it up to chance don't leave it up to chance do let
01:15:13.76 --> 01:15:20.96 do the work and that's the way that's how you develop these things no one told me no one told me
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:24.88 what I just said I would maybe I wish somebody's would have and the reason I say maybe is because
01:15:24.88 --> 01:15:28.32 maybe you still don't learn it because there's some things that you have to actually go through
01:15:29.28 --> 01:15:32.80 there's some things that the only thing that's going to teach you is experience yeah and
01:15:33.68 --> 01:15:40.16 even like these you went through these things where the environment sort of provided these lessons
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:46.000 no matter how like over or covert they were like provided to you through the environment like
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.40 you know like a like a farmer or something like this someone who's sort of grew up just working
01:15:50.40 --> 01:15:54.88 hard as a way of life you put them in another environment we're working hard will show itself
01:15:54.88 --> 01:15:58.96 or whatever or they'll work hard yeah because the environment sort of provided that whatever
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:04.88 so yeah so that makes sense you know and obviously we can't count every second of your life
01:16:04.88 --> 01:16:09.28 and years where this came from and it was it you know obviously but it seems like the work ethic
01:16:09.28 --> 01:16:14.32 and being able to like show fortitude like mentally through things or whatever it seems like
01:16:14.32 --> 01:16:19.52 that's an environmental thing fully it is and that's why redcurrence was biking five miles to work
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:24.88 in five miles home every day monday through Saturday yeah six days a week get some up in
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:32.96 will please upill both ways so that is what they learned in this training some of these things
01:16:32.96 --> 01:16:39.12 that we just talked about and and again the book details these things really well but we're going
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:45.44 to jump ahead right now to a chapter five accrues to North Africa on the ship I bordered
01:16:45.44 --> 01:16:50.08 and after endless trudging along narrow passageways and up and down the steep stairs and
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:55.92 gangways I was directed to an area below the waterline after the ship soon after casting off
01:16:55.92 --> 01:17:00.64 we learned that we were heading for Algiers from where we would take part in a combined
01:17:00.64 --> 01:17:05.28 operation by Great Britain in the United States codenamed operation torch that's legit you get on
01:17:05.28 --> 01:17:09.68 this ship to leave you don't even know where you're going you're just going to go get some
01:17:09.68 --> 01:17:12.48 you yeah that's what you know you're going to go get some
01:17:12.48 --> 01:17:21.20 moving forward here they're on the ground um and again I hate to skip these parts this is a book
01:17:21.20 --> 01:17:27.28 you got to get and I'll talk about how to get it again because it's not a normal book we were
01:17:27.28 --> 01:17:34.56 informed that our objective was an enemy emergency air strip close to a place called Suk El Arba
01:17:34.56 --> 01:17:42.24 in Tunisia along the way we were attacked by two M.E.109s but these were success we shot down by our
01:17:42.24 --> 01:17:48.40 escorts of Spitfires boom thanks to the Americans easing their rule about smoking on aircraft
01:17:48.40 --> 01:17:52.96 I managed to feel more relaxed by puffing through half a dozen cigarettes so now they're going
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:57.60 for their jump by the way they're going to jump into this um into this emergency air strip
01:17:59.52 --> 01:18:04.000 it was a three hour journey in very hot and humid heat and we sat in the plane sweating like
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.12 pigs singing songs and cracking jokes to try and hide our feelings chunky said well lofty
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:11.92 that's his nickname he brings up a couple times well lofty won't be long now
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:20.40 see you in heaven you must be joking mate I replied turtley he's got to be a damn good
01:18:20.40 --> 01:18:26.88 Jerry to catch up with me then the order was bellowed out action stations it made me shiver
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:35.04 hook up I was sweating sweating like hell and fell a bit weak at the knees I wondered out loud
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:41.04 what sort of reception are we going to get what mate crabsriast oh nothing I'm uttered
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:47.28 I hooked up my line with shaky fingers managing to endure 10 minutes of standing
01:18:47.28 --> 01:18:52.32 while the plane came to in to drop us at the airfield out in the wild 70 miles
01:18:52.32 --> 01:18:58.80 from Tunis so the reason I put that part of there is just letting everybody know especially
01:18:58.80 --> 01:19:02.72 you young troopers out there that are going on hold the line you're going to be scared
01:19:03.68 --> 01:19:09.44 and even this guy that is just a fundamental badass across the board is shaking fingers
01:19:09.44 --> 01:19:17.36 he's sweating profusely he's scared and by the way he's hiding it to the best of his ability
01:19:17.36 --> 01:19:23.84 he's keep he's stifling that emotion continue on the jump master's piercing voice cut through
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:28.24 the sound of the aircraft stand to the door I swallowed hard and prepared for the exit
01:19:28.88 --> 01:19:33.84 when the order to go rang in my ears I became a changed man it suddenly felt so much cooler
01:19:33.84 --> 01:19:38.88 being whisked about in the air all around me were hundreds of parachutes we were finally dropping
01:19:38.88 --> 01:19:48.32 in action there you go so you're going to be scared once you get in the action you'll settle down
01:19:49.84 --> 01:19:56.72 and okay so now this is the land they move and now they get into a situation
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:03.92 we were machine gun costly one minute we were in put in buses and the next taking cover
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:10.80 once with Pat Dolan and chunky I dash for safety across an open ground and slid into a hundred feet
01:20:10.80 --> 01:20:15.28 slid into a hollow 100 feet from a derode as three small specks of mishrishmets
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:20.08 came diving straight for us from 4,000 feet I lay on my stomach looking at the aircraft through
01:20:20.08 --> 01:20:25.92 my camouflage net scarf as they came in fast much closer now and three of them open fire one
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:30.96 concentrating on the road transport the other two honor men scrambling for cover on each side of the road
01:20:30.96 --> 01:20:36.96 bullet slash the ground ten feet from us kicking up fountains of dust bloody hell pat that was
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:42.16 close said chunky they circled and came in for another run this time really low only about
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:50.32 50 feet from the ground a couple of our act-act guns let fly jerry let rip and muck seem to be
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:56.56 flying everywhere mainly rock splinters and dust as one aircraft clattered by I saw quite
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:02.96 plainly the pilot with a white scarf around his neck you fucking fool you might have killed us
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:08.72 someone shouted and then let out a bellowing laugh amazingly after all that strafing no one was
01:21:08.72 --> 01:21:13.84 seriously hurt and only two of our vehicles were rendered unserviceable as time went on things
01:21:13.84 --> 01:21:23.04 continued to hot up and the buses were soon abandoned in favor of foot slogging so again this is like
01:21:23.04 --> 01:21:28.24 a horrifying thing to think about these measures met one-on-nines coming down and strafing you
01:21:28.24 --> 01:21:37.28 with machine gun this pushing forward a little bit in the book there another situation
01:21:38.32 --> 01:21:43.28 then they turn towards us three stucodive bombers approaching us at about five thousand feet the
01:21:43.28 --> 01:21:48.000 sky was clear invisibility was good it was most weird not knowing whether they were interested in
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.64 us or just passing but they were interested in us all right the leading pilot made half a roll
01:21:54.64 --> 01:22:02.000 and nose down the preliminary commencing that awe-inspiring stucodive angle of 85 degrees as it
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.16 wind nearer I could see the evil go-win shape so clearly it seemed to be approaching me head on
01:22:08.16 --> 01:22:15.28 and it was and I was at my wits end as to whether I should get out and run for it or stay safely
01:22:15.28 --> 01:22:20.96 put but possibly perish before I could make up my mind us off for black dots moving away from the
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:28.64 aircraft they were bombs seemingly aimed directly at me they're discent accompanied by a high-pitch
01:22:28.64 --> 01:22:35.28 scream I gripped my smock and braised myself the sides of my slit trench took shook and a shower
01:22:35.28 --> 01:22:40.48 of freshly dug soil cascaded over my face partly filling the trench Christ that's closed I thought
01:22:40.48 --> 01:22:45.68 it allowed the other two stucos came into repeat the treatment and there seemed to be a never-ending
01:22:45.68 --> 01:22:51.52 succession of bombs violently vibrating around then the drone aircraft drifted away and as
01:22:51.52 --> 01:22:56.40 as black smoke below slowly skyward voices began to ring out as men sought to
01:22:57.20 --> 01:23:02.08 sought reassurance that others were okay chunky was there on the edge of my trench asking
01:23:02.08 --> 01:23:10.32 if I was all right putting on a brave front I said I was and I was except for a little excretion
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.16 but then getting away with nothing more than a wet pants after that lot did not hurt my pride
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:25.76 I didn't tell the others though so that freaking bombs drop right on top of them
01:23:25.76 --> 01:23:36.32 pistons pants no factor happy to be alive continue on we need only been in and this is
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:40.56 again skipping we had only been in Tunisia for a few days in our bag of enemy killed or captured
01:23:40.56 --> 01:23:45.68 was fast increasing together with quite an assortment of armored cards motorbikes and weapons
01:23:48.32 --> 01:23:53.52 they get into some gun fights I found myself going on a volunteer burial party for men
01:23:53.52 --> 01:24:01.12 known to be lost or killed in action for any dead or wounded paras that's a parachute guys
01:24:01.84 --> 01:24:06.32 the Arabs could be the biggest menace as some of them would think nothing of stripping
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:11.28 a corpse of its clothing and then just leaving it if a ring would not come off the finger with
01:24:11.28 --> 01:24:17.44 ease the finger might be severed to achieve their greedy end at times it was reported that wounded
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:27.12 both sides were mutilated by these scum and here he's out on these um basically like on a
01:24:27.12 --> 01:24:34.32 little burial party after some of these battles had taken place we came upon two more paras
01:24:34.32 --> 01:24:39.28 one lying by a large rock a jagged cut with dried blood right across his temple
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.04 the other just a few yards away looking a bloated blue green
01:24:45.04 --> 01:24:51.28 I had seen dead soldiers before usually just after being killed but this retrieving of
01:24:51.28 --> 01:24:56.88 private papers of private papers and dog tags from dead men was not in my book of training
01:24:57.76 --> 01:25:01.52 and I was lost for a moment wondering if I was alone in this nightmare
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:08.72 and then there's a there's a podray with a minister with him and he says the podray broke
01:25:08.72 --> 01:25:18.24 the silence by inquiring in a most serene voice now who have we here we buried those two side by
01:25:18.24 --> 01:25:27.12 side and then he goes forward here things were beginning to hot up now and we found ourselves
01:25:27.12 --> 01:25:32.88 taking part in some large scale skirmishes with an enemy who is not going to take it all lying down
01:25:32.88 --> 01:25:38.96 now he says hot up he doesn't say heat up and he says that throughout the books that's why
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:44.80 I prayed for a little extra expression on it so people don't think that I was misreading it
01:25:44.80 --> 01:25:48.56 but he says things were beginning to hot up now maybe we'll bring that back
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:54.96 and here we go fast forward a little bit I was just taking a position with the mortar
01:25:55.52 --> 01:26:00.40 when the CEO went around firing his pistol on the open side slots of the tanks and calling
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:04.72 for the crews to come out so here's the CEO and there's some tanks some enemy tanks and this
01:26:04.72 --> 01:26:10.24 guy's approaching him with the pistol on reaching the third tank shots were fired back and he fell
01:26:10.24 --> 01:26:17.52 clutching his chest followed by his agitin captain Miles Whitelock who is hitting the face
01:26:17.52 --> 01:26:23.52 amid the general den of battle I was too busy to get trying to get dug into the rocky soil to
01:26:23.52 --> 01:26:28.72 make out exactly what had happened but soon learned that the CEO had been severely wounded and
01:26:28.72 --> 01:26:35.20 major Pearson was now to take over command it was a great blow to me at this time also to hear
01:26:35.20 --> 01:26:44.48 the death of my old friend Stanley Wandless I was horrified by a different site and a
01:26:44.48 --> 01:26:50.48 enormous brute of a pig munching away at a dead German soldier it seemed the pig had somehow
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:56.88 come across the wine in this farm got filthy drunk and was eating everything
01:26:56.88 --> 01:27:02.96 such scenes became horribly familiar but my stomach gradually grew accustomed to them
01:27:05.04 --> 01:27:09.92 on Christmas day 1942 I watched the rain fall as I tried to make myself a little more comfortable
01:27:09.92 --> 01:27:15.28 in my slit trench rain trickled down my neck my hands were wet and cold and if I had had a
01:27:15.28 --> 01:27:19.76 cigarette I would have enjoyed it my feet had been constantly wet for god knows how long and I was
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:28.08 beginning to feel a teeny bit browned off when good news we were being withdrawn for arrest off we went
01:27:28.08 --> 01:27:36.24 to sucel comis where I thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of a mobile bathroom it de-lousing and refitting
01:27:37.36 --> 01:27:44.000 it was heaven but we soon returned to the grind once more so again I picked out some highlights of
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.48 the first kind of action that they had but you have to get the book to kind of follow along exactly
01:27:50.48 --> 01:27:55.44 what they'd been through but they'd been through really tough fighting and then finally they get the
01:27:56.64 --> 01:28:00.88 they get the turn they get the word that they're going to take a little break which they do but
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:07.52 you know like I said earlier it's it's a little break it's not big and just like I talked about
01:28:07.52 --> 01:28:13.12 the times where you get a little reprieve from the cold wet miserable but then you'd
01:28:13.12 --> 01:28:16.80 it's time to go back in and that's what you have to do and these guys do that.
01:28:19.20 --> 01:28:24.08 going on here between the two they're then up in this spot between the two towns is a hill called
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:35.76 Jebel Montmansoir the commanding height to the pont du tunis road it's 2000 feet above sea level
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:41.28 five miles around at the base and has an easiest climbing angle of 45 degrees also known by
01:28:41.28 --> 01:28:48.24 us as hill 648 it was occupied by crack German Africa core and alpine troops and it was our
01:28:48.24 --> 01:28:57.76 job to take it at all costs. I thought this word would be a tough nut to crack but the
01:28:57.76 --> 01:29:04.80 men were determined to win through this through but the men were determined to win through
01:29:04.80 --> 01:29:11.04 and shift the enemy once and for all we checked our arms and ammunition and collected 48 hours
01:29:11.04 --> 01:29:17.60 of rations. So there's this dominant high ground that they need to take and it's got their
01:29:17.60 --> 01:29:23.28 Africa core who I talked about earlier it's got the alpine troops these are these are really good
01:29:23.28 --> 01:29:27.92 German troops and this point early in the war you know this is when this is when the German
01:29:27.92 --> 01:29:36.48 military was really really good I mean later in the war they were still good but they you know
01:29:36.48 --> 01:29:41.04 they suffered massive casualties and they started having like little you know younger troops
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:44.48 inexperienced troop Hitler youth you know kids that were 14 years old out on the front lines
01:29:44.48 --> 01:29:50.16 getting after it this is early in the war these are experienced troops you know these are the troops
01:29:50.16 --> 01:29:58.40 that were this is where you know the the Prussian roots of military genius are showing through
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:08.000 and these troops and this is it this is these are tough tough this is a tough enemy so going on here
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:13.36 we started off and it was quite a long way over rough and uneven ground before we halted at
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:18.08 the base of an ugly massive looking hill the usual advanced bombardment that preceded most
01:30:18.08 --> 01:30:22.32 attacks was not forthcoming on this occasion as we wanted to maintain the element of surprise
01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:28.56 this time Jerry would be first to rock the boat as we waited at the base of the hill the sky now
01:30:29.60 --> 01:30:35.12 and again became bright with German nightlights which when fired heavenward made the whole area
01:30:35.12 --> 01:30:41.68 quite luminous everyone froze until they fell to earth and safety returned once more in the form of
01:30:41.68 --> 01:30:49.12 semi-darkness in this waiting game I found my thoughts strange back to England what I could do for a
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:55.52 couple of finds pints of English beer there's not until four o'clock in the next morning we ventured
01:30:55.52 --> 01:31:02.56 carefully toward forward through the undergrowth up went to more German nightlights then two more
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:07.36 then still more the places illuminated like daylight they must have got wind of us or smelt us
01:31:07.36 --> 01:31:12.48 we could determine the nationality of a soldier from at fifty feet if the wind was favorable
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:17.84 so probably they could do the same from the top of the hill two machine guns began firing
01:31:17.84 --> 01:31:22.88 then more joined in as the place were alive with them and they slashed and ripped mercilessly
01:31:22.88 --> 01:31:27.68 at the brack and slicing the branches of trees as if an invisible sharp knife had done the job
01:31:27.68 --> 01:31:32.56 I'll pull it went through my trouser leg gazing my thigh but I didn't think too much of it as I was
01:31:32.56 --> 01:31:38.88 still mobile German mortar started hitting the approach slope and yells a pain here and there told
01:31:38.88 --> 01:31:44.72 me to take more care the wine overhead was also warning that the enemy artillery was joining in
01:31:45.28 --> 01:31:50.64 as things hot it up with the occasional tracer bullet mixed in with the machine gun fire I could
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.12 almost feel the hot led piercing my limbs it was certain I would not get away with this time
01:31:55.12 --> 01:31:59.76 farther back things had gone wrong with our usual stalwart mules the amazing animals that
01:31:59.76 --> 01:32:04.56 carried our heavy gear where men could not set foot they didn't appreciate the sudden shelling
01:32:04.56 --> 01:32:11.60 and bolted out of control major clums be Thompson managed around some of them up with the
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:20.16 help of a French officer major pre-alue and then all housing to be let loose our man our men yelling
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:27.76 woo hoo Muhammad as the R&T companies went in with their bayonets unfortunately asked company
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:33.12 miss their correct route the tapes laid to assist their assent had been damaged or cut by the enemy
01:32:33.12 --> 01:32:40.88 activity and at the count we were to find that they had suffered extremely heavy casualties and
01:32:40.88 --> 01:32:46.40 this can't of woo hoo Muhammad this is throughout the time that they're fighting in Africa and they do it
01:32:46.40 --> 01:32:50.72 when they get to Europe as well it's just the we something that the locals did and they started doing it
01:32:50.72 --> 01:32:59.44 too it's kind of like the term gung ho which gung ho the the Chinese turn which means work it's
01:32:59.44 --> 01:33:06.40 actually a Chinese communist term which means work together and you know we use it and they started
01:33:06.40 --> 01:33:12.24 using it I believe isn't a Korean war they started using that term but I had been in World War
01:33:12.24 --> 01:33:16.56 II working with the Chinese anyway I the I must have been when it was must have been
01:33:16.56 --> 01:33:21.52 we're doing World War II when they were working with the Chinese and the Chinese would say gung ho
01:33:21.52 --> 01:33:27.28 work together kind of means get fired up down well now yeah that's how we use it Americans
01:33:28.16 --> 01:33:36.32 we can take work together and turn it into get after it the barrage we were set up against was intense
01:33:37.04 --> 01:33:41.92 and a ricocheting bullet or shell splinter often did as much damage or more that is straightforward
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:47.52 burst of fire we could occasionally be lucky at one time an artillery shell failed to explode on
01:33:47.52 --> 01:33:53.04 impact with the ground and went on mercilessly ricocheting three times before coming to a rest with a doll
01:33:53.04 --> 01:34:01.60 plop but the bombardment was unrelenting and we had to work and we had our work cut out here
01:34:01.60 --> 01:34:06.96 there was agonizing shrieks of pain right and left to me as I passed unrecognizable
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:12.32 as I passed men unrecognizable soaked in blood being tended to a barrage splendid medics
01:34:12.32 --> 01:34:17.84 those unsung unarmed heroes Sam cost her and Frankie Thompson reached the summit and searched
01:34:17.84 --> 01:34:25.04 out and dealt with the enemy with no ceremony whatsoever as Sam told me afterward Frankie was
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:29.60 lunging and tossing men with his bayonet as though he as though they were sacks of straw
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:35.60 Frankie was a big chap usually very friendly and quietly spoken but an action
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:46.96 a different man picture that bayonet on your rifle and your throwing men off of it lunging
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:52.08 and throwing men with the bayonet as if they were sacks of straw Frankie Thompson done play
01:34:54.40 --> 01:34:59.68 amid the turn all the turmoil and dead and wounded of both sides the curtain of fire had lifted
01:34:59.68 --> 01:35:08.32 and it was not a sound this is once they get up to the hilltop looking around the hilltop
01:35:08.32 --> 01:35:15.12 only a few of our men could be seen moving among the twisted forms our R T and S companies
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:22.24 had suffered very heavy casualties more than half of the battalion officers had been killed or wounded
01:35:22.24 --> 01:35:32.88 he as they kind of get settled on the top of the hill he as they're preparing for a counter
01:35:32.88 --> 01:35:38.56 attack which they know the Germans are going to do he gets sort of tasked with going around and helping
01:35:38.56 --> 01:35:43.68 and gather up the sick dead or the wounded in the dead he goes on here setting about the job of
01:35:43.68 --> 01:35:50.64 collecting the wounded was something sickening as I gazed upon the scene of our once able and
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:57.36 live comrades now quite still or with torn limbs I wondered whether there was any such thing as civilization
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:04.000 I bet hard on my lip and went about my task with grim determination
01:36:05.92 --> 01:36:11.84 looking around for someone to help I noticed a lad who is in the same troop as me early in
01:36:11.84 --> 01:36:20.80 1941 hello taffy and one of you been up to like a lift that's how he greets this guy cheers lofty
01:36:20.80 --> 01:36:26.56 and like I said lofty is the nickname of red cheers lofty is nice to see someone alive he said
01:36:26.56 --> 01:36:32.56 weirdly he was in a sitting position and apparently been hit by no fewer than five bullets
01:36:32.56 --> 01:36:38.56 they were all clean flesh wounds in the calf five four arm and one through the apex of his
01:36:38.56 --> 01:36:46.48 penis and all rather uncomfortable but no broken bones he was pretty well saturated with blood
01:36:47.04 --> 01:36:55.12 but cheerful let's try a fireman's carry I suggested he'd had a shot of morphine so I didn't think
01:36:55.12 --> 01:37:01.92 he'd feel he would feel too much anything to get away from here he said at that point Jerry started
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:06.96 up again with artillery and mortars then a few snipers and to make it really interesting
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:14.48 some sookah dive bombers stuccus dive bombers to join in the chorus let's get going before it gets
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:22.08 too hot I've got to get you on my back I said so once again this is you know he's saying this
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:27.76 so kind of matter of faculty he's up there trying to rescue this wounded guy who's obviously
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:34.80 badly wounded he's been shot five times and then they start with artillery and mortars
01:37:34.80 --> 01:37:40.000 and then snipers and then stuccadive bombers that's what's going on and then he says he says
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:44.72 let's get going before it gets too hot it's like it doesn't get any hotter
01:37:46.80 --> 01:37:51.28 I've got to get you on my back I said I managed to get him over my shoulder without causing too much pain
01:37:51.28 --> 01:37:56.40 and we started along the long trek through wounded country ravines and open waste it was a
01:37:56.40 --> 01:38:02.08 ticklish and tender drop job but for two hours we struggled on I was sweating like two pigs and he
01:38:02.08 --> 01:38:08.08 goes through a description of how hard it was to get this guy to an area where he could get some
01:38:08.08 --> 01:38:14.56 of the help that he needed once he gets that guy dropped off continuing on I joined a section
01:38:14.56 --> 01:38:21.60 comprising men from T and S companies they were mostly newcomers I wondered what to become of all
01:38:21.60 --> 01:38:26.48 the friends I had not seen since the attack started one of the lads told me that major canron
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:33.84 had been killed and captain meller too I felt so alone no disrespect to the reinforcements
01:38:33.84 --> 01:38:37.36 but the cream of our men were fast disappearing in the foothills of Tunisia
01:38:38.88 --> 01:38:45.92 Jerry was counter attacking in earnest now and slinging everything at us in the way of explosives
01:38:45.92 --> 01:38:51.76 with batches of stuccadive bombers joining in at two hour intervals and making things even more
01:38:51.76 --> 01:38:57.60 deafening the muck was falling heavily and a splinter from a nearby bursting bomb
01:38:58.64 --> 01:39:02.32 slashed of vain in my right hand while another praying to my helmet
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:11.04 nipping over rocks and creeping through bracken and bush under a hail of bullets and screaming
01:39:11.04 --> 01:39:16.56 shells I had become I became cut off from the party of men I'd been attached to I was making
01:39:16.56 --> 01:39:20.96 good progress and stopping for a breather dropped into a small depression in the ground.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.36 Suddenly alone German pounced on me from the rear I realized what was happening instantly
01:39:27.36 --> 01:39:34.16 when I saw the field gray cut of his uniform my schmizer which was out of ammunition was
01:39:34.16 --> 01:39:40.56 slung band-lear fashion over my shoulder but I had an american 45 automatic cult ready in my right hand
01:39:40.56 --> 01:39:45.04 I went down on one knee summoned up the unarmed combat I had been taught
01:39:45.04 --> 01:39:50.24 grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and heaved him with all my force over my head it was my turn now
01:39:50.24 --> 01:39:56.72 and I was not so gentle as he rolled onto his back I sprang and landed my 14 stone weight
01:39:56.72 --> 01:40:01.76 feet first on his chest grabbing the cult which I had released to dangle on its landyard I
01:40:01.76 --> 01:40:08.56 started to squeeze the trigger shouting you butcher bastard to his no no comrade no no no
01:40:08.56 --> 01:40:17.36 I pulled the trigger but it was empty I grabbed his rifle check that it was loaded and ordered him
01:40:17.36 --> 01:40:24.40 to his feet donka donka he kept saying hugging his chest as we moved off and with that he
01:40:24.40 --> 01:40:31.68 starts moving to get this prisoner back under control arriving back at Borada after the
01:40:31.68 --> 01:40:36.80 formality of delivering my prisoner to custody I rejoin the rest of the battalion we were in
01:40:36.80 --> 01:40:41.84 great need of rest and a refit and we were and we're all sent by truck to a place called
01:40:43.12 --> 01:40:53.04 tabursuk some 60 miles away wall Borada was handed over with thanks to the Americans
01:40:54.72 --> 01:40:59.04 we were very soon back with the great so they get a little breather we were very soon back with a
01:40:59.04 --> 01:41:06.56 brigade this time in the Jebel aboid area the brigade's manpower was well down with the enemy
01:41:06.56 --> 01:41:13.44 and the enemy usually outnumbered us three to one death ridge as my pet one parah
01:41:13.44 --> 01:41:18.72 as my first parah position in happy valley was known also developed the name shell shock ridge
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:26.72 I tried closing my eyes at any given explosion it was a terrible feeling like waiting to be
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:33.68 massacred the German started to mount an attack it was daylight and I could see motorized
01:41:33.68 --> 01:41:39.76 enemy units being dropped off at points as near as they dared to our positions three or four
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:46.72 miles off in the direction of sedegene they spread out and extended order and started tortoise
01:41:47.60 --> 01:41:52.40 we were told to hold our fire until the last minute so the whole first battalion lay very quiet
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:57.44 and still and we mortars saturated the area I felt the draft of an exploding shell which
01:41:57.44 --> 01:42:03.36 defamed my left ear and left it ringing and at the same time propelled me to the bottom of my trench
01:42:03.36 --> 01:42:10.000 making me even wetter than I already was now the mortar braided lift and I'm skipping ahead a
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.96 little bit now the mortar brazed lifted and I could hear the silence of the solider machine gun fire
01:42:16.96 --> 01:42:24.56 as it severed the undergrowth the enemy getting near all the time 60 yards 50 yards 40 yards
01:42:24.56 --> 01:42:30.88 I peaked gingerly over the edge of my hole in the ground 30 yards 20 yards then above the din
01:42:30.88 --> 01:42:38.32 the order was bellowed fire fire fire advance advance as we went out to meet them the
01:42:38.32 --> 01:42:43.68 battalion flung everything the enemy that it flung everything at the enemy that it could
01:42:43.68 --> 01:42:50.32 Tommy guns brand guns stand guns capped captured solathorns and smithers grenades English
01:42:50.32 --> 01:42:56.56 German Natayan coupled with the cry of woo hoo Muhammad gripping my rifle I advanced through
01:42:56.56 --> 01:43:02.32 the murderous fire the haze of smoke and the accurate smell of explosives every available man was
01:43:02.32 --> 01:43:07.60 on this one even the cooks before long the tables had turned in our favor with two dead
01:43:07.60 --> 01:43:12.24 paras lying to my left I hopped over a dead German and came upon a wounded one a little to my
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:17.52 right he was contemplating using a luger pistol but I booted it from his hand and clomped him
01:43:17.52 --> 01:43:23.36 in the face with the butt of my rifle the whole episode was soon over with the enemy beating a
01:43:23.36 --> 01:43:29.44 hasty retreat and leaving a bag of captured clean shaven German parasheus flown in direct from
01:43:29.44 --> 01:43:38.32 Germany to deal with us one a shock for them so that's like just again whatever a couple
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:46.88 paragraphs maybe two paragraphs and I mean it's total insanity right the guys are 20 yards away
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:59.76 before they get the the order not only to fire but to advance continuing on this is now they're
01:43:59.76 --> 01:44:06.72 doing a coordinated attack while we pushed on with two paras and three paras brought up the rear
01:44:06.72 --> 01:44:12.88 the British 139th brigade attacked on our right in time the pimple on this name of like a little
01:44:12.88 --> 01:44:19.52 null was retaken and our brigade proceeded to press home the final assault amidst devastating artillery
01:44:19.52 --> 01:44:28.80 and mortar fire from both sides tragically we found that we had gone a little too fast for our
01:44:28.80 --> 01:44:36.08 25 pounders to increase their range quickly enough and we suffered heavy casualties from our own fire
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:44.24 at daylight I passed a jock Pearson crouched by a rock bellowing into a field radio and none
01:44:44.24 --> 01:44:50.08 too pleased with the person on the other end what do you think you're doing he wrote you're killing
01:44:50.08 --> 01:45:06.48 all my bloody men so little horrible blue on blue scenario happening man everything but everything
01:45:06.48 --> 01:45:11.84 seemed to be in our favor now even the weather was kinder and we must have advanced about eight
01:45:11.84 --> 01:45:17.92 miles under a curtain of continuous fire both until both Italians and Germany were ready to
01:45:17.92 --> 01:45:27.04 give in and we're running to be captured so think about this scene with just massive fire and you're
01:45:27.04 --> 01:45:42.08 advancing under that fire for eight miles they get um they're they're doing this they're continuing
01:45:42.08 --> 01:45:46.88 to advance in this part and here measure schmets buzz the area spraying the ground spasmotically
01:45:46.88 --> 01:45:51.92 and causing those nearest to drop quickly into convenient holes we pushed on at a steady pace
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:58.72 passed demolition guns past demolished guns and supplied dumps the air stinking with a pollen butchery
01:45:59.52 --> 01:46:06.08 I glanced and stinctively towards a shell burst fifty yards away as I watched its jet black smoke
01:46:06.08 --> 01:46:12.72 belt skyward my gaze was transfixed by something odd on the ground I wanted if it could be a human
01:46:12.72 --> 01:46:19.04 drawing nearer I saw that it was the roasted body of a man in the sitting position he must have
01:46:19.04 --> 01:46:24.96 been driving a scout car or light vehicle as there were small pieces of charred twisted metal
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:32.40 spread fifty feet around with dismembered arms and legs torn and blood soaked uniforms
01:46:32.40 --> 01:46:40.48 littering the black scorched soil the aroma was diabolical someone accidentally brushed the
01:46:40.48 --> 01:46:52.48 sitting form on passing and the body simply disintegrated with a sickly sound fast forwarding a bit
01:46:52.48 --> 01:46:59.20 the smell of burnt flesh coated in my direction and I quickly and I quick into my pace to get
01:46:59.20 --> 01:47:05.76 clear of it plotting on in these awful humid and dusty conditions I think I felt almost immune
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:13.04 to wearing this and the shocking sights of war nothing seemed to be able to stop us now
01:47:17.04 --> 01:47:22.40 and this is again you got to read this book but this site sort of concludes this section the first
01:47:22.40 --> 01:47:29.04 parachute brigade group was not destined to take part in the final push to tuna's our role
01:47:29.04 --> 01:47:37.20 in the campaign had come to an end and we were withdrawn from the line so ending five months hard
01:47:37.20 --> 01:47:43.68 slog and again that we were just burning through this book and I'm skipping so many sections
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:51.68 this stuff is this is five months this is half a year just about of this type of fighting
01:47:51.68 --> 01:47:58.64 originally trained as shock troops in Tunisia after the initial parachute assaults
01:47:58.64 --> 01:48:03.28 we had served as plain infantry but that's just the way the wind blew for us
01:48:04.40 --> 01:48:10.16 metals were plentiful and all ranks had earned them eight distinguished service orders
01:48:10.16 --> 01:48:17.12 15 military crosses nine distinguished conduct metals 22 military metals
01:48:17.12 --> 01:48:29.60 three raw digger and one legion to honor in their own way even our German adversaries had
01:48:29.60 --> 01:48:37.44 recognized the brigades fighting ability by naming us the red devils for those who are there
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:47.84 though the price of success was unspeakably high we had lost more than 1700 men killed wounded
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:59.76 or missing so again I hate to burn through five months of insane fighting
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:10.64 and I'll take a dig at red right now like he's so matter of fact about stuff and he only
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.68 hits on the high points I'm hitting on the high points of the high points right just insane
01:49:16.56 --> 01:49:24.80 insane to think about that for five months so from there they're transported from Tunisia
01:49:24.80 --> 01:49:32.56 back to Algeria and they spend time training for a drop into Sicily a parachute drop
01:49:32.56 --> 01:49:37.44 in Sicily which once again you're fighting in Africa look it's really tough conditions in
01:49:37.44 --> 01:49:42.80 Africa now you're getting closer to Germany like you're going into going into Sicily you know
01:49:42.80 --> 01:49:50.24 what's waiting for you it was hoped that if Sicily could be taken it might prompt an Italian
01:49:50.24 --> 01:49:54.96 surrender a large proportion of my battalion including myself now went down with this entry
01:49:57.76 --> 01:50:02.40 goes in and talking about a lot of that this is no this is just it's like no nothing's easy
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:09.04 between exercises we acclimat acclimatized our reinforcements to use every
01:50:10.64 --> 01:50:15.44 they're used every type of enemy weapons including Schmeizer automatic which we found superior to our own
01:50:15.44 --> 01:50:25.92 standgun so now they start preparing for this mission in Sicily there were three bridges to take
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:35.44 in Sicily and the password for them was to be desert rats with the reply kill Italians
01:50:37.92 --> 01:50:41.68 as the plane took off chunky said well this is it our second operation
01:50:41.68 --> 01:50:48.16 I tried to act normally but could feel the sweat running down my cheek so once again he's
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:55.04 stifling some emotions in here they go getting on this getting ready to do this drop
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:05.44 and this is just it's just crazy as we drew nearer to our objective and at a thousand feet
01:51:05.44 --> 01:51:12.32 I could see the flack and tracer zipping past the wing of the aircraft for 30 minutes we
01:51:12.32 --> 01:51:17.36 dodged everything they threw at us but it was a tens half hour as we were helpless to do anything
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:24.08 so you're in an airplane you're getting ready to parachute and there's flack bombs exploding around
01:51:24.08 --> 01:51:29.44 you trying to take down your aircraft and tracer fires zipping but you know how much protection
01:51:29.44 --> 01:51:39.20 an aircraft gives you from tracer fire from machine gunfire zero what's flack so it's anti-aircraft
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:43.52 they set it for a certain altitude it goes up in the air and then just blows up in hopes that
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:47.76 some of that shrapnel will hit the aircraft and damage the aircraft and take them down
01:51:47.76 --> 01:51:57.04 so flack jacket is to roll it so flack actually flack is just little chunks of its fragmentation
01:51:57.04 --> 01:52:05.04 right all chunks of metal that that come off of explosive device that could grenade or a artillery
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:10.64 round that's going to blow up like on purpose yes that's what it for and then a flack jacket
01:52:10.64 --> 01:52:16.16 is to protect you from flack good yeah and in the old days like the flack the term
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:20.80 flack jacket the flack jacket would protect you from flack it wouldn't protect you from a bullet
01:52:20.80 --> 01:52:27.84 because flack isn't going as fast as a bullet is so like an old school Vietnam flack jacket
01:52:27.84 --> 01:52:32.64 wouldn't stop bullets but it would protect you from flack yeah like motorcycle jacket kind of thing
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:38.72 like it's like it'll it'll protect you but not from the real deal yeah yeah yeah so even
01:52:38.72 --> 01:52:43.84 so even nowadays right the expression like don't give me any flack it's like kind of that yeah yeah
01:52:43.84 --> 01:52:50.32 exactly yeah exactly what it is so these guys are up there and like he says helpless
01:52:50.32 --> 01:52:55.12 and by the way this is a half an hour of this
01:52:55.68 --> 01:53:00.32 suddenly we were given continuing suddenly we were given the order to hook up I did so
01:53:00.32 --> 01:53:05.04 and waited the engines cut back on the approach to our drops on we descended to around 600 feet
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:09.60 with all sorts of rubbish whizzing by and the plane pitching and tossing like a toy in a vast
01:53:09.60 --> 01:53:17.76 vacuum then there came a terrific explosion as our tail was hit the order jump man jumped
01:53:18.24 --> 01:53:25.92 screamed in my ears and I tumble through the doorway into the void below so they are craft finally
01:53:25.92 --> 01:53:30.64 takes a devastating hit he doesn't he doesn't mention whether the aircraft made it or not he just
01:53:30.64 --> 01:53:35.68 says that it you know the tail was hit hard I can't imagine that's super easy to fly a plane
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:42.40 what's the tail's been blown off now he gets on the ground again fast forward a little bit
01:53:42.40 --> 01:53:48.40 on the ground about 300 yards in my left was the main coastal road to the town of
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:57.92 Katania and enemy traffic wasn't tremendous confusion to my rear I could hear Italian voices
01:53:57.92 --> 01:54:03.84 and about a hundred yards to my right Germans wrapping out orders then now the road came a 15
01:54:03.84 --> 01:54:09.04 strong German patrol they could have been parachutists judging by their dress and head gear
01:54:09.04 --> 01:54:14.40 fortunately I was not alone when they were just a few yards off and we opened up on them
01:54:15.44 --> 01:54:21.44 there were some grunts, groans and sickly yelps then silence we slipped on in the direction of the
01:54:21.44 --> 01:54:27.04 bridge around which our men were by now silently killing harassing and panicking the German
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:35.20 Italian defenders at night small battles raged unceasingly and we were pinned down for a long
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:40.56 time by mortar fire when daylight broke though I saw the for the first time the vast mountain scenery
01:54:40.56 --> 01:54:46.72 at the base of which we had been fighting again I'm just jumping through stuff then the sun starts
01:54:46.72 --> 01:54:54.16 to come up it became warm and then the heat became intense a typical you're never you can never just
01:54:54.16 --> 01:54:59.36 be comfortable it's always like freezing cold or too hot you would you he had 15 minutes where
01:54:59.36 --> 01:55:04.72 it was warm and then they were too hot there had been no firing for some time and I realized that
01:55:04.72 --> 01:55:09.28 the enemy was no longer with us scanning the countryside I could see burnt out cars Italian tanks
01:55:09.28 --> 01:55:15.20 and ammunition dumps the smell of burnt bodies and oil filled the air I was glad to move on
01:55:15.20 --> 01:55:22.08 such a confusion of our brigade such was the confusion of our brigade drop that come daylight
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:27.76 three men from the men from three parah discovered they spent all night fighting alongside the
01:55:27.76 --> 01:55:34.32 men of first pair without realizing it at the bridge it was clear that there had been a fierce battle
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:41.20 the pill boxes had been rushed and dealt with ruthlessly here the brigade mustard approximately
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:46.16 180 men but the three inch mortars in ammunition had not arrived and there was a lack of communication
01:55:46.16 --> 01:55:52.40 without side units wireless sets those are radios had been either incorrectly netted back in
01:55:52.40 --> 01:55:58.64 Africa were damaged on the landing or just did not arrive we learned that German parachutists
01:55:58.64 --> 01:56:05.92 from the third regiment of the first fallshemierger division had dropped simultaneously on our
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:12.16 drops on the previous night so we must have indeed have brushed shoulders with them when we
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:18.80 came upon that 50 man patrol how crazy is that you're jumping into a drop zone and the
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:28.40 Germans are jumping in there too and then he grows as things start to escalate he's talking
01:56:28.40 --> 01:56:36.16 around how hot it was like hot as in not heat temperature but hot as in enemy action little
01:56:36.16 --> 01:56:41.36 wonder things were so warm the area within an approximately two mile radius of the bridge was
01:56:41.36 --> 01:56:47.52 festoon with 88 millimeter and 20 millimeter guns pill boxes machine gun pits and also a few
01:56:47.52 --> 01:56:53.52 coastal guns and we were engaging with crack German troop including pair troops they presented a good
01:56:53.52 --> 01:56:58.56 target whenever they got too near the bridge you could not miss but word run around that our supply
01:56:58.56 --> 01:57:05.12 of ammunition was now drastically low conserve ammunition in fire only when you are absolutely certain
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:12.88 of a kill was the order but do in due course members of the first and third pair of battalions
01:57:12.88 --> 01:57:18.24 at the northern end of the bridge with Drew to join us at the southern end the enemy was getting
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:28.08 harder to ward off as tanks and tanks began to appear now we got tanks enemy tanks on the scene
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:34.000 we were using captured Italian 40 millimeter anti tank gun along with our own anti tank gun
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.40 the battle worked up to a terrific climax the Germans were sending their best troops in an effort to
01:57:38.40 --> 01:57:44.72 shift us their pair of troopers probing for weak spots and allowing no respite food was in our
01:57:44.72 --> 01:57:50.40 haversax but there was no time to get it it was fire fire and keep on firing finally there was a
01:57:50.40 --> 01:57:56.24 wall at about 1830 or soon after giving us a chance to take stock maybe the Germans wanted to
01:57:56.24 --> 01:58:01.60 regroup I checked my ammunition and found only four rounds left plus one in the chamber
01:58:01.60 --> 01:58:09.44 at 1930 we were ordered to withdraw in order to avoid capture and go in small groups we made it off
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:18.000 in a westernly direction toward the gona loung the gona lunga river if we could use the river
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.64 and the road running parallel to it as a guide for a couple miles perhaps then we could be
01:58:22.64 --> 01:58:28.48 clear of any enemy concentrated attack so these guys are basically bagging out of the area
01:58:28.48 --> 01:58:36.16 and as they're doing their doing in small groups at one point as darkness fell we came upon a
01:58:36.16 --> 01:58:40.96 deserted farmhouse but decided not to enter as it was quite near an abandoned flat gun pit
01:58:40.96 --> 01:58:45.84 we thought both sides would be we thought both could be booby trapped it was approximately
01:58:45.84 --> 01:58:51.76 zero 200 by now we were very tired in hungry we dosed off in an orchard 20 feet from the edge
01:58:51.76 --> 01:58:57.76 each man at the base of a different tree so as to be less conspicuous so they spend the night in this
01:58:57.76 --> 01:59:06.96 orchard and then they set off once again we saw no more of the enemy via lentini
01:59:08.16 --> 01:59:15.28 we reached Augusta some 50 miles from Primisol Bridge finding the town in our hands it was a great
01:59:15.28 --> 01:59:23.92 site to see so many of our own troops and tanks and so they continue on reaching Syracuse without
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:30.40 miss hop on this on the 17th of July just four days after dropping in Sicily we soon set sail
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:38.48 arriving back at Sous in Tunisia on the 20th our first parachute brigade group had not only suffered
01:59:38.48 --> 01:59:45.60 heavily in the North African campaign but in Sicily too where we had lost a further 300 men killed
01:59:45.60 --> 01:59:53.76 wounded or missing it was time to rest refit regroup and reorganized and we also
01:59:53.76 --> 02:00:03.60 got to relax so I mean this this is a group of men that are now just hardened combat
02:00:04.40 --> 02:00:13.20 that's and yet there's no war there's no end to this in sight right I mean there's no end
02:00:16.40 --> 02:00:20.80 hey I guess if you looked at it from a strategic perspective knowing what we know today maybe you
02:00:20.80 --> 02:00:26.88 could say there's an end in sight but if you know you're barely surviving this you're barely
02:00:26.88 --> 02:00:31.20 surviving it you know what the end is I mean you have to accept what the end is probably in a
02:00:31.20 --> 02:00:40.08 big the end is probably gonna be you're not gonna live in early November we were told that the whole
02:00:40.08 --> 02:00:43.68 first airborne division was returning to England and the first parachute brigade would leave
02:00:43.68 --> 02:00:50.64 from Algiers at the end of the month on the 29th of September we shipped out of Algiers
02:00:50.64 --> 02:00:59.36 on the SS Samaria happily heading for Liverpool now one particular chap made a popular appearance
02:01:00.64 --> 02:01:10.000 Peter the battalions unofficial lovable dog Peter liked water and jumping from planes and was the
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.48 only parachute dog on record at first he was owned by a lad named topor brown and rumor had it
02:01:18.48 --> 02:01:24.40 they had both escaped from Dunkirk in 1940 Peter was a marvel and could do almost anything
02:01:24.40 --> 02:01:30.16 asked of him never forgetting a trick put a stone on his nose and back away and he'd remain motionless
02:01:31.12 --> 02:01:39.28 but at a given command he would toss and catch that stone water was his god there had been static
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:45.04 tanks eight feet deep at bullford into which a stone could be thrown Peter would retrieve it no time
02:01:45.04 --> 02:01:52.08 and then sit patiently waiting for another run when we had set off from North Africa in October
02:01:52.08 --> 02:01:58.16 the previous year he had been smuggled aboard the a run the castle everyone helping in the
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:06.32 scheming to get him aboard and keep him fed exercised and comfortable he had been left behind in Algieria
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:10.88 in the good care of the cooks and the rear echelon party when we went on to meet the enemy in
02:02:10.88 --> 02:02:17.44 Tunisia where topor brown was taken prisoner and sadly never heard of again
02:02:18.96 --> 02:02:24.40 corporal Jim Nash the battalion hairdresser of our company then took care of Peter
02:02:25.04 --> 02:02:31.36 and is it was at mate more in Algieria during training for the Sicily operation that Jim took him
02:02:31.36 --> 02:02:36.72 up for his first jump from an aircraft a special bag had been made who was fixed to Jim's front
02:02:36.72 --> 02:02:44.16 with a hole at the top for Peter's head to protrude they made a perfect landing Peter running off as
02:02:44.16 --> 02:02:51.52 happy as Larry wagging his tail after various other escapades Peter returned to Algieria's and was
02:02:51.52 --> 02:02:58.80 smuggled aboard the Samaria where he was having a great time until the locker door of his hiding
02:02:58.80 --> 02:03:04.40 place was accidentally left unsecured during one of our boat drill procedures and he ventured out on
02:03:04.40 --> 02:03:11.92 his own he was found wandering below by the ship's officer who ordered him to be put over the side
02:03:13.44 --> 02:03:20.24 we were just two days out from Liverpool the men were furious and it was just as well that the
02:03:20.24 --> 02:03:25.92 officer responsible could not be found as a roving band of justice seeking Paris could not have been
02:03:25.92 --> 02:03:34.80 expected to be lenient as far as Peter was concerned he had such enthusiasm for water that maybe
02:03:34.80 --> 02:03:41.92 he was fitting to end up in a sea grave but we felt as loss I don't mind admitting that we fighting
02:03:41.92 --> 02:03:50.32 men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done perhaps especially after all we'd seen
02:03:50.32 --> 02:04:03.44 and done I wrote Peter a poem entitled Epitaph to a friend it's last verse as follows Peter made us
02:04:03.44 --> 02:04:12.08 happy and carefree he had no military apparel he made just two jumps his grave is the sea
02:04:12.08 --> 02:04:27.28 his wings truly earned and the name red devil kind of a theme that we see come up from time to time
02:04:28.56 --> 02:04:35.60 the attachment that soldiers can get to these to these dogs that they they come across at some point
02:04:35.60 --> 02:04:46.64 and unfortunately recurring theme is some rear echelon person doesn't understand killing those animals
02:04:51.20 --> 02:04:55.76 and I also thought it was you know it's interesting that line I don't mind admitting that
02:04:55.76 --> 02:05:01.36 we fighting men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done and they says perhaps especially
02:05:01.36 --> 02:05:09.52 after all we'd seen and done that's something that is I mean I think that's absolutely true you know you
02:05:10.80 --> 02:05:16.64 there's no better there's the sunset looks a million times that infinitely better when you know
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:22.96 the sacrifices that have been made to see the sunset the white bedsheets that you get to sleep on
02:05:22.96 --> 02:05:29.52 you appreciate infinitely more when you've been sleeping in the dirt for six months and it goes on and on and on
02:05:29.52 --> 02:05:36.24 then so when you see when you see the depravity that that human beings are capable of
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:45.36 well that can actually expose the fact that you really can cherish all innocent
02:05:46.88 --> 02:05:47.84 let us in a little dog
02:05:47.84 --> 02:06:06.08 and these guys arrived back home get stationed the first battalion get stationed at
02:06:06.08 --> 02:06:12.72 Grim's Thorpe Castle and at this point they know something really big is in the air
02:06:12.72 --> 02:06:20.24 and he says here in August men coming from our old training area of Tatten Park
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:25.84 reported seeing thousands of tanks there like a giant tank park sure enough in mid-September
02:06:25.84 --> 02:06:33.36 we were finally setting off somewhere I checked over my gear one gammon bomb two dot three six
02:06:33.36 --> 02:06:39.04 hand grenades combined pick and shovel webbing equipment with small pack two ammunition pouches
02:06:39.04 --> 02:06:45.60 and bandlear with three oh three ammunition water bottle mess tin iron ration field dressing
02:06:45.60 --> 02:06:51.36 camouflage net scarf triangle shape air recognition bright yellow silk scarf tied around the neck
02:06:51.36 --> 02:06:58.80 for ready for instant use rifle and an escape kit comprising of a silk map of Europe a small
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:04.64 button compass and a strong file the size of a nail file that was about it except for a
02:07:04.64 --> 02:07:09.92 kit bag strap to the leg and parachute plus may-west life jacket in case we finished up in the
02:07:09.92 --> 02:07:14.80 drink I felt like an overdue pregnant hippo and didn't know where to put anything else
02:07:15.44 --> 02:07:20.40 though still I added 200 cigarettes two bars of chocolate and some boiled sweets
02:07:22.96 --> 02:07:33.20 it's interesting the yellow scarf for recognition and he specifically says tied around the neck for
02:07:33.20 --> 02:07:38.64 instant use and it's interesting we we kind of I always carried one the basic reason why I
02:07:38.64 --> 02:07:45.84 was carried one because I was a radio man when I was a young and listed guy and I used it at times
02:07:45.84 --> 02:07:54.32 I had learned the value of it signaling helicopters and signaling boats in the jungle like if you
02:07:54.32 --> 02:08:00.72 and the weird thing is you when you're in a boat let's say you're in a river along the jungle
02:08:00.72 --> 02:08:05.60 there's so much jungle to look at that it's really hard to see someone waving their hand like
02:08:05.60 --> 02:08:10.16 it seems so obvious when you're waving at some waving at a boat hey hey I'm over here the
02:08:10.16 --> 02:08:13.76 first of all they can't hear you because they're running engines shoot machine guns they can't hear you
02:08:14.72 --> 02:08:20.88 and second because they're looking at whatever quarter mile or half a mile of green
02:08:21.68 --> 02:08:26.32 bush they got this whole thing to try and find you and you're in a green camouflage uniform
02:08:26.32 --> 02:08:32.000 and you're waving your they can't see you so you need I would always have a aircraft panels what we
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.24 call them aircraft sing with panel which is just bright fluorescent orange and I could whip that
02:08:36.24 --> 02:08:41.52 thing out really quickly and then it then you become a lot more visible same thing with the aircraft
02:08:41.52 --> 02:08:47.68 overhead well in a body it didn't take long before everyone was carrying that because and they were
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:51.68 carrying big ones too like a platoon or like an element that was going in a building would have a
02:08:51.68 --> 02:08:57.12 big giant one that you could hang out a window everyone we are here hey friendly forces we are here
02:08:58.72 --> 02:09:06.48 so even this guy World War II that bright yellow silk scarf in important signaling device at the hand
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:13.52 he says I I wondered how the rest of the men were going to fare on this hop
02:09:13.52 --> 02:09:23.52 I was just getting used to the new faces like Frankie Panzer Manzer Bill Silberry Terry Brace Dick
02:09:23.52 --> 02:09:34.56 Bingley Dolly Gray major parent brown Sid Oxley Guv Beach with his top hat the Germans
02:09:35.76 --> 02:09:42.000 will surrender in surprise if he takes him with that I thought Joe McReedy patty McCormick
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:51.28 and Captain Joe Gardner that mean just I just had to read those names for two reasons number one
02:09:51.28 --> 02:09:56.56 because they sound like the best bunch of characters you could ever hang around and also so everyone
02:09:56.56 --> 02:10:01.52 remembers that all these people that we're talking about they're all people
02:10:01.52 --> 02:10:11.44 unfortunately sergeant Busty Everett had fallen ill and died at Born
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:18.56 we were from all over the country and beyond and on the whole one big happy family
02:10:19.44 --> 02:10:24.88 it was daylight when we clambered into trucks and headed toward the arrow drone at Barxton Hall
02:10:24.88 --> 02:10:37.12 everyone was tense but ready to go come what may he goes on here our objective was to capture
02:10:37.12 --> 02:10:45.04 and hold the bridge straddling the rine at our nm my first parachute patty and was to seize the
02:10:45.04 --> 02:10:50.80 high ground to the north our escorting typhoon spit fire and Mustang fighters were weaving
02:10:50.80 --> 02:10:55.92 between the decodes and gliders as we cross the English channel tension began to mount in my
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:00.32 plane we approach land on the other side and could see the area that had been flooded to try and
02:11:00.32 --> 02:11:05.12 stop her and peed the advance of our land forces i was admiring the landscape when the order
02:11:05.12 --> 02:11:13.60 rang out action stations hook up green light on go being number 13 night a few long seconds to
02:11:13.60 --> 02:11:18.08 wait as I shuffled forward then i felt a slight pat on my parachute back and again found myself
02:11:18.08 --> 02:11:23.92 tumbling out of the doorway into that familiar open void my parachute opened once more obediently
02:11:24.56 --> 02:11:28.96 and i drifted down to earth without difficulty after a good three point landing i was now an
02:11:28.96 --> 02:11:34.08 enemy occupied territory except for the occasional machine gun fire and some blasting from enemy
02:11:34.08 --> 02:11:39.60 machine gun placements the landing had been unopposed and the whole dropping north zone north of
02:11:39.60 --> 02:11:45.28 he'slam was packed with gliders and discarded parachutes everyone soon collected themselves
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:53.04 and rendezvous to their perspective points the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of
02:11:53.04 --> 02:12:01.84 September 1944 the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of September 1944
02:12:04.88 --> 02:12:09.68 leaving the drops on we made a way quickly along the track running alongside the wood
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:16.40 west of wolfhees and south of the railway the end of the track lined up with a road running parallel
02:12:16.40 --> 02:12:21.92 to the railway turning right here and then over the road onto the railway sidewalk we noticed our
02:12:21.92 --> 02:12:31.28 way toward wolfhees station suddenly there was a loud explosion up ahead and some machine gun fire
02:12:31.28 --> 02:12:41.28 and now this is when things start to get hot our company still upfront became engaged in a fierce
02:12:41.28 --> 02:12:46.96 battle facing armored cars, mortars and machine guns it was getting dark now the whole
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:53.12 battalion laid doggo for a while to try to avoid further detection we lay up in the woods for
02:12:53.12 --> 02:13:00.96 some hours pushing on occasionally buck cautiously at one point in time unbeknown to the enemy they
02:13:00.96 --> 02:13:07.76 completely surrounded us in the semi dirt so here they are they're kind of like laid up they're not
02:13:07.76 --> 02:13:12.96 trying to move too much in the semi dark we passed down winding lanes this is when they start
02:13:12.96 --> 02:13:19.84 pushing forward through the woods and along the south side of the road we were now about five miles
02:13:19.84 --> 02:13:26.56 from the arndam bridge and so far luck had been with us at about two o'clock in the morning there
02:13:26.56 --> 02:13:32.64 were sounds a battle ahead apparently coming from an area north east north northeast of Lichtenbeek
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.92 on arriving there at about 0-500 we found that the leading companies had met fierce opposition
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:46.64 and it suffered heavily then with no reason given at the time the original plan to go for the
02:13:46.64 --> 02:13:54.24 high ground north of arndam was changed and we instead turned south towards marion doll
02:13:54.24 --> 02:14:01.04 an asterbeek some two miles from the bridge at 0-600 we entered asterbeek
02:14:02.48 --> 02:14:07.68 where we met members of the Dutch underground movement who showed us the easiest route to the bridge
02:14:09.44 --> 02:14:14.72 we were moving cautiously in a file ready for action and everything seemed a little bit too quiet
02:14:14.72 --> 02:14:20.96 at 0-630 as dawn was breaking we moved up into a built up area and then it started
02:14:21.52 --> 02:14:25.92 the enemy had been busy overnight preparing gun emplacements taking up positions at vantage
02:14:25.92 --> 02:14:34.16 points posting snipers and concealing tanks and SP guns German gunfire shattered the piece and I
02:14:34.16 --> 02:14:38.72 darted for cover and took up position in the neatly laid out garden of a nearby house
02:14:38.72 --> 02:14:43.84 more firing came from the house direction with two other men I ran around the back of the house
02:14:43.84 --> 02:14:50.96 and fired as two Germans in the shrubbery they must have had their chips with two other men
02:14:50.96 --> 02:14:55.76 I round around the back of the house and fired at two Germans in the shrubbery they must have
02:14:55.76 --> 02:15:01.84 had their chips amid the smoke and fire of machine guns SP guns and six barrel mortars the
02:15:01.84 --> 02:15:08.32 battle ranged the battle raged and built to such a pitch that I became quite accustomed to it
02:15:08.32 --> 02:15:15.68 and went about the task as if on street fighting training back in home we hadn't eaten since
02:15:15.68 --> 02:15:21.12 leaving England but I was too busy to be hungry casualties were mounting mounting incredibly fast
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:26.56 and in every direction I could see motionless forms of our men cut down in their tracks
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:31.92 progress was slow and the battle became more intense as the bridge loomed gradually nearer
02:15:33.20 --> 02:15:37.04 with two other chaps I did not know I chased after some Germans in a house
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:40.72 we threw a grenade in and dashed to the door to finish them off with stand and rifle
02:15:41.68 --> 02:15:46.24 looking around for any more of the enemy we were built we built it to the rear of the house
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.60 I tripped over a broken fence and went sprawling as I scrambled up I heard a close wine and
02:15:51.60 --> 02:15:58.24 recognized which I recognized was a mortar I die for cover by a low wall and the bomb landed very near
02:15:58.24 --> 02:16:03.60 near enough to feel the draft snipers were taking pot shots at us dodging and weaving through
02:16:03.60 --> 02:16:09.84 gardens and backyards I came to stop at an opposite of factory held up by held up by a heavy
02:16:09.84 --> 02:16:16.72 mortar machine gun fire yet again I threw myself into the ground it was absolute bedlam
02:16:17.44 --> 02:16:23.36 with the slicing sound of German southern solar their guns their bullets cutting their
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:30.72 in every direction and the repeated spark of mortars followed by the wine and sound of hot
02:16:30.72 --> 02:16:37.20 shrapnel hitting the rooftops a small lump lump of shrapnel hit my helmet sounding like a pee on a drum
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.36 in a heat of battle men were shouting curses lobbying grenades through open doors and windows
02:16:43.36 --> 02:16:48.24 and following up with shrieks of contempt for the enemy and a cry of woo hoo Muhammad
02:16:49.76 --> 02:16:55.92 casualties really began mounting there were groans from men who had been hit motionless perilous
02:16:55.92 --> 02:17:01.60 motionless perilous lay in the road and slumped over walls I saw a pair of feet protruding from a
02:17:01.60 --> 02:17:08.48 garden gateway one boat one boot blown off but leaving the foot complete such as the magical
02:17:08.48 --> 02:17:17.12 phenomenon of war the German fire power was murderous and all I could do was keep alert for the sound
02:17:17.12 --> 02:17:28.48 of English I had a horrible feeling that my battalion was being cut to ribbons going forward a
02:17:28.48 --> 02:17:32.48 little bit there was a heck of a battle going on inside the factory and men were scrapping
02:17:32.48 --> 02:17:38.80 furiously with grenade stins called handguns and fighting knives the wall of the house opposite
02:17:38.80 --> 02:17:43.44 received a blast of machine gun fire coming from behind me I was about to move off and pursuit of a
02:17:43.44 --> 02:17:50.88 German in the garden of a terrorist house on the on my right when I felt an explosion just beneath me
02:17:51.52 --> 02:17:58.000 and a sharp pain. Reeling over and looking down I saw that the lower part of my right leg was in a
02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:04.08 most unusual position and blood was oozing out steady and fast I shouted for help and two
02:18:04.08 --> 02:18:11.52 paras dashed up quickly and rendered first aid one of them sergeant knobby hall called for medical
02:18:11.52 --> 02:18:19.44 orderly I was worried but felt like a nuisance as everyone was busy enough already without being
02:18:19.44 --> 02:18:25.20 lumbered with me I was placed on a way I was placed on a stretcher and carried into a wooden
02:18:25.20 --> 02:18:30.64 shed a few yards away where medics cut the boot off of the foot of my shattered leg smashed by an
02:18:30.64 --> 02:18:38.08 explosive bullet it looked awful but strangely I didn't feel much pain they tore open the field dressing
02:18:38.08 --> 02:18:44.80 I had carried for so long in different parts the world but never previously needed and carried out a
02:18:44.80 --> 02:18:50.88 quick but thorough job pandemonium was raining outside as machine so at this point obviously he's been
02:18:50.88 --> 02:18:59.12 wounded he's been wounded really bad his leg is in very rough shape he can't walk pandemonium was
02:18:59.12 --> 02:19:04.88 raining outside as machine gun fire echoed around the built up area a mortar bomb landed quite near
02:19:04.88 --> 02:19:11.12 but the medic administrating a more-feet injection kept a steady hand as if he were in the safety
02:19:11.12 --> 02:19:18.24 of a hospital back in England so the talk about detaching the medic is just cool and calm
02:19:20.32 --> 02:19:24.64 while the other medic hunted around for suitable makeshift splint a young Dutch girl appeared
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:29.28 from nowhere and offered me a welcome cup of water I was feeling cold and clammy and her help
02:19:29.28 --> 02:19:35.12 was a great comfort as was the morphine which soon began to take effect there was another series of
02:19:35.12 --> 02:19:41.92 explosions just ahead a clear signal to get moving and I was carried cautiously to the corner of
02:19:41.92 --> 02:19:47.44 a house next to the road I'd come down only a short while ago everyone was scattered
02:19:48.64 --> 02:19:54.16 everyone was scattered and there were dead paras in the road on the sidewalk and in the gardens
02:19:54.16 --> 02:19:59.76 snipers were busy and our men were bent on winkling them out there was a thud a whiz and a bark
02:19:59.76 --> 02:20:04.24 of an exploding shell followed by another and another all bursting on the rooftops of houses
02:20:04.24 --> 02:20:08.64 thirty yards back then something flash from an upper window only twenty yards ahead and bullets
02:20:08.64 --> 02:20:13.36 splattered on the wall above us the medic set me down to wait for an opportune met moment to get
02:20:13.36 --> 02:20:18.000 across the road and I saw four paras press themselves into the wall of the building opposite
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.92 as they worked their way toward that flash went under the window the leading parac kick the
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:30.56 door out and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and threw back
02:20:30.56 --> 02:20:37.36 in the potato masher is the classic German grenade with a long handle on it which they did so
02:20:37.36 --> 02:20:42.08 that they could throw grenades as far as as the Americans could because we play baseball and they
02:20:42.08 --> 02:20:50.40 play soccer and you don't kick you don't kick grenades you have to throw them the leading parac
02:20:50.40 --> 02:20:55.12 kick the door and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and
02:20:55.12 --> 02:20:59.84 threw back in a company by a mills bomb which is their grenade thrown by another man there was
02:20:59.84 --> 02:21:04.96 quite some explosion following which four paras entered the building spring stand gun fire in the
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:12.32 room and threw up through the floorboards a trick we had learned in training I was more than
02:21:12.32 --> 02:21:16.56 relieved to get out of the line of fire was carried into the relative safety of a garden wall
02:21:16.56 --> 02:21:21.20 as I laid helpless behind the wall I had a clear view of the clatter and confusion in the battle
02:21:21.20 --> 02:21:29.84 and the through the demolished gateway so he goes on here obviously I'm not covering the whole
02:21:29.84 --> 02:21:35.68 book but covering some sections of things that are unfolding I was moved with a number of
02:21:35.68 --> 02:21:41.52 other wounded men to a nearby barn where I spent a fairly easy night thanks to the powerful effects
02:21:41.52 --> 02:21:46.08 of the morphine injection I'd been given early the following morning all was reasonably quiet
02:21:46.08 --> 02:21:51.04 in the immediate vicinity although I could hear the sound of battle not far off looking around the
02:21:51.04 --> 02:21:57.12 barn I didn't recognize anyone from my first paty and and those men I spoke to did not want to
02:21:57.12 --> 02:22:03.68 know they were either too preoccupied with their wounds or unable to talk at all some of them
02:22:03.68 --> 02:22:08.96 looked as though they had just lived through a nightmare which I would say is an accurate statement
02:22:08.96 --> 02:22:21.04 and again it's like everything that he's talking about is just you know complete mayhem combat
02:22:21.04 --> 02:22:25.76 that's what he's talking about it's just totally out of control and finally it settles down a
02:22:25.76 --> 02:22:30.16 little bit for that night and it sounds like maybe the probably the brits at that point
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:40.56 it done a good counter attack maybe established a perimeter unfortunately doesn't last at about 0700
02:22:40.56 --> 02:22:46.64 two medics came up to me and said that my turn was next this is as they're trying to extract them
02:22:47.36 --> 02:22:51.12 lifting the stretcher they carried me to a waiting Jeep it's engine running there were
02:22:51.12 --> 02:22:55.44 four walking wounded in the back seat and I was strapped to the front of the bonnet alongside
02:22:55.44 --> 02:23:02.08 another chap who was already strapped in on the on beside the what windscreen he forced to grin
02:23:02.96 --> 02:23:09.20 what's yours I asked they got me in the guts he said bluntly that's a nasty place to cop it I
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:15.44 thought feeling sorry for him a short stocky medic jumped in the driver seat saying hold tight
02:23:15.44 --> 02:23:20.32 in the back and don't worry you two in front on the bonnet we might have a rough ride and it will be a bit
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:33.44 fast what do you even do I mean they take you they put you on a stretcher on the hood of a
02:23:33.44 --> 02:23:38.64 freaking Jeep and they're like and the medic says hold on to the guys in the back and says hey
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:42.88 up front don't they've got them strapped down there's nothing they can do they can't move I wouldn't
02:23:42.88 --> 02:23:49.92 want to do that on a Tuesday afternoon you know going to like to the market I mean imagine
02:23:49.92 --> 02:23:53.68 I'm like hey I'm taking the market I put you on the hood of my car strap you down and say hey it's
02:23:53.68 --> 02:24:02.56 going to be a little rough. After a fast fast forward after a fast bumpy journey the Jeep
02:24:02.56 --> 02:24:08.72 tore through Usterbeek passed the net the original headquarters at the heart and steam hotel
02:24:08.72 --> 02:24:14.24 and pulled up sharply in the drive of the taffled berigo tell a few hundred yards farther on
02:24:14.24 --> 02:24:19.36 airborne medics quickly unstrap me and took me inside setting me down on the floor opposite a window
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.48 in the entrance hall the hotel taffled berigo had been German field marshal walther model
02:24:26.48 --> 02:24:32.56 modells headquarters prior to our arrival the previous Sunday and we were now using it as an improvised
02:24:32.56 --> 02:24:38.40 military hospital it must have taken a few knocks as it was now in absolute shambles as usual
02:24:39.20 --> 02:24:44.64 the British Tommy had managed to brew up even in such hazardous conditions and I was given a mug of
02:24:44.64 --> 02:24:49.52 tea and a bar of chocolate my first foods in sleeping in England two days earlier I had not touched
02:24:49.52 --> 02:24:54.80 my ghastly iron ration I tried to sleep but with the interruption of shelling and mortar fire
02:24:54.80 --> 02:25:00.56 prevented that when night fell I just long for daylight to come again I hated the nights it was bad
02:25:00.56 --> 02:25:08.000 enough to be meeting angry Germans in battle but it was worse to do so while I slept the next day
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.000 Wednesday I was grateful to be taken into the operating room ingeniously rigged up in the kitchen
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:22.40 of the hotel so he gets some he gets some preliminary worked on on his wounds and of course the
02:25:22.40 --> 02:25:29.60 brits I know I've talked about this they like to brew up their tea and they will do it that's how they
02:25:29.60 --> 02:25:35.04 roll I was returned to the entrance hall where the den of battle embolitating the wall outside
02:25:35.04 --> 02:25:40.24 maybe look out I was surprised to be is to see a German wandering about so pictures is you're in a
02:25:40.24 --> 02:25:45.44 hospital you just got like the shrapnel cut out your leg they sit taken set you down and now you're
02:25:45.44 --> 02:25:52.16 watching the battle out of window and you see a German wandering around he took up a stand position
02:25:52.16 --> 02:25:58.40 by the door and then began pacing up and down just then there was a loud crump outside and debris
02:25:58.40 --> 02:26:04.24 plaster and glass fell all around I looked to see where that one landed and the German I had seen
02:26:04.24 --> 02:26:10.000 outside only a few moments ago was now sprawled out killed I presumed by one of his own mortar bombs
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.04 but that should tell you with a situation there there's Germans outside the window walking around
02:26:17.84 --> 02:26:24.000 I was set down at the head of the stairs to my right leg glider pilot who had a face and arm injury
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.92 amid all the wounded who covered most of the landing area came a wounded man walking our eyes met
02:26:29.92 --> 02:26:35.68 did I know him I hardly knew anyone they were unrecognizable clotted up with blood and dirt
02:26:35.68 --> 02:26:45.84 then up the stairs belted some combat paras and we asked them how it was going I had to
02:26:45.84 --> 02:26:50.80 had to capture this because this is just as british as it gets so these there's like we just said
02:26:50.80 --> 02:26:55.68 there's Germans walking around outside this places total shambles and they see a couple paras and he
02:26:55.68 --> 02:27:02.72 says hey how's it going and one of the paras answers not too bad not too bad could be a bit better
02:27:02.72 --> 02:27:10.40 before disappearing back down again that's like that's a no factor response yeah oh by the way
02:27:10.40 --> 02:27:14.96 we're about to get overrun but not too bad not too good be better but you know we got this
02:27:18.64 --> 02:27:22.96 fast forward a little bit a wounded man with his arm and a sling approached me with an inquiring look
02:27:22.96 --> 02:27:29.52 what unit chum he asked almost in a whisper first pair I replied I'm in a shower of dust and smoke
02:27:29.52 --> 02:27:35.36 as yet another shell exploded very near he went and withdrew from the direction of the shell blast
02:27:36.48 --> 02:27:42.72 just as we felt the ominous vacuum of warm air he was almost incoherent as he glanced around the
02:27:42.72 --> 02:27:49.12 terrible scene of man-made destruction I just left the bridge he said there was quite a pause what's
02:27:49.12 --> 02:27:54.64 it like there I asked he swung around glaring at me as if the whole war was my fault his eyes
02:27:54.64 --> 02:28:00.000 hard staring and red with fatigue the poor fellow had been hit through with something bad
02:28:01.36 --> 02:28:06.40 I offered him a cigarette and with a trembling hand he took one it hung limping his grasp
02:28:07.04 --> 02:28:12.56 thanks I don't really smoke but I'll have when he said then he answered it was bloody hell there
02:28:12.56 --> 02:28:17.04 tanks belching fire blocks getting killed left and right the carnage was terrible
02:28:18.40 --> 02:28:23.68 he paused as a medic passed by with a man clutching his side and hoveling on one leg a bloody
02:28:23.68 --> 02:28:29.84 congealed bandage wrapped around the stump where once had been a foot my lad drew hard on the
02:28:29.84 --> 02:28:36.48 cigarette and coughing continued there were hordes of them they went on for hours attacking
02:28:36.48 --> 02:28:44.32 shelling then the bastard started burning us out my two mates got killed the twisted and broken
02:28:44.32 --> 02:28:49.52 bodies of our men were strewn everywhere he leaned back against the wall looking a little
02:28:49.52 --> 02:28:55.68 mortise I don't know but I think it may have been the first I may have been the first person he had
02:28:55.68 --> 02:29:01.12 spelt out his experiences too they're he told me that it was his first time in action
02:29:02.56 --> 02:29:09.68 I thought he had ridden it bloody well the next few days seemed to drag on forever with my leg
02:29:09.68 --> 02:29:14.56 giving me much more pain now than it had during the first 24 hours after I was hit
02:29:14.56 --> 02:29:22.16 and so obviously these guys are rallied up and they're suffering but it doesn't mean that
02:29:22.16 --> 02:29:27.12 they're safe continuing on there are so many shells landing in on and around the building
02:29:27.12 --> 02:29:31.84 plus the occasional burst of machine gun fire spattering the inner walls that I imagine we
02:29:31.84 --> 02:29:37.52 must be slapped bang in in the front line or somewhere in no man's land by the way that's the
02:29:37.52 --> 02:29:44.16 field hospital there were hundreds of wounded in enemy included as well as Dutch people caught up in the
02:29:44.16 --> 02:29:49.84 fight so many that some got moved to the hotels and acts across the driveway and any man with
02:29:49.84 --> 02:29:55.36 flesh wounds or injuries that did not hinder the use of a firearm was ordered outside to fight
02:29:56.56 --> 02:30:03.92 so if you could fight now it's time it was now the 23rd of September and I was lying still
02:30:03.92 --> 02:30:08.88 at the head of the broad stairway and there was commotion down below those ruddy hunds again
02:30:08.88 --> 02:30:13.52 said the glider pilot there was a shuffling in German orders were being wrapped the out
02:30:14.64 --> 02:30:21.28 then some SS troops dashed up the stairs a sinister looking type about 20 years old led the way
02:30:21.28 --> 02:30:25.28 and was coming right out of it coming right at me I found myself looking straight down the barrel of his
02:30:25.28 --> 02:30:30.64 schmizer his trigger finger shaking I didn't bat an eyelid I just did not want to have set
02:30:30.64 --> 02:30:36.56 him and give him a cause to let rip he was glaring at me with red BDI's Christ this is it I thought
02:30:37.92 --> 02:30:43.44 I had heard of other wounded being shot up but my luck was in any past me by he and two other
02:30:43.44 --> 02:30:49.20 SS men had a good look around and took a and then took up firing positions at windows in rooms leading
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:55.52 off the landing as they started to fire out Colonel Warwick dast up the stairs swearing and
02:30:55.52 --> 02:31:01.44 rebuking them for firing from a clearly marked red cross building discipline took over they look
02:31:01.44 --> 02:31:06.24 to find and so on but with fingers handling their automatic's hesitantly they reluctantly obey
02:31:06.24 --> 02:31:12.56 the officers command and stop firing so as I talked about early with the
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:19.04 and clearly these are some Germans that have respect for the law of armed conflict
02:31:19.84 --> 02:31:24.72 and they there which let's just start with this we're in the hospital building and now we got
02:31:24.72 --> 02:31:31.20 the the Germans in the building using it as a firing position I don't even know what to say about this
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:38.24 like what what is that even how do you even translate that into into reality your wounded your
02:31:38.24 --> 02:31:44.72 your hospital is getting mortar to machine gun and then there's German enemy soldiers in your
02:31:44.72 --> 02:31:56.40 building firing from inside your building walking around looking at you oh and he comments about this
02:31:56.40 --> 02:32:00.24 it was most strange to have enemy in the building one minute only be replaced by your own combat
02:32:00.24 --> 02:32:08.56 men the next so that's his statement about it is that yeah strange I wondered how the rest of
02:32:08.56 --> 02:32:13.60 my first parabatian were doing right from the Sunday night our our company had a tough time
02:32:13.60 --> 02:32:23.44 losing half of its men in the D lyridudal area then 40 men of six platoon as company were killed
02:32:23.44 --> 02:32:32.08 in two minutes on the approach to Archnem Arnhem and in the denbrink St. Elizabeth's hospital
02:32:32.08 --> 02:32:41.20 and factory area the rest of the battalion was badly mauled in the midst of it all father
02:32:41.20 --> 02:32:47.20 Benson a Roman Catholic priest was busy making his rounds and answering urgent calls
02:32:48.16 --> 02:32:55.28 one man so constantly needed things began to get on my nerves that morning
02:32:57.76 --> 02:33:03.20 which is kind of interesting because he's been through all this stuff he's wounded
02:33:03.20 --> 02:33:09.04 he's surrounded by the enemy he's on his whatever however many hundreds of days in close combat
02:33:09.04 --> 02:33:15.28 that he's been in over the past few years and now that he's wounded and surrounded and there's
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:19.68 men screaming and dying all around them things are getting on his nerves a little bit this morning
02:33:20.72 --> 02:33:27.60 makes sense that's that's what that's what rages up to so things began to get on my nerves that
02:33:27.60 --> 02:33:33.12 morning what with the continuous den of battle outside in my leg getting more painful through lack of
02:33:33.12 --> 02:33:39.28 proper medical attention I called for father Benson to offer a few words of comfort so he came and put
02:33:39.28 --> 02:33:45.68 me at my ease later he was too as wounded by tank fire into the building I'm sorry to say that he
02:33:45.68 --> 02:33:54.48 died from those wounds and was buried in the grounds of St. Elizabeth's hospital on the following day
02:33:54.48 --> 02:34:03.44 the disposition was frightening once again under statement the British under statement because
02:34:03.44 --> 02:34:09.68 as far as I'm concerned everything up to this point is completely horrifying on the following day
02:34:09.68 --> 02:34:15.52 the disposition was frightening our men were still doing their damnness but the Germans were slowly
02:34:15.52 --> 02:34:20.88 closing in very slowly mark you for they lost heavily and had to fight for every inch of the
02:34:20.88 --> 02:34:28.80 bloody ground they got there with things getting hotter still I was moved again to what was thought to be
02:34:28.80 --> 02:34:35.36 a safer spot just to the other side and along the landing area suddenly there was an all mighty
02:34:35.36 --> 02:34:41.04 explosion in the room on my right men were already wounded once twice were hit again in somewhere killed
02:34:42.88 --> 02:34:48.24 there were pittiest cries coming from that room it was at this time that major John Wadi
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:54.48 of the 156 parachute battalion who had started his parachute days in India when the battalion was
02:34:54.48 --> 02:35:00.16 first formed was wounded again and two English medics and a Dutch nurse were killed a medic now
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:05.84 came out cradling a form in his arms the chapy carried could have been dead or unconscious
02:35:06.56 --> 02:35:11.76 he was covered in blood and his arm was shattered and hung prophetically by his side his left leg
02:35:11.76 --> 02:35:24.72 bandaged from his first wounding Christ I wish I were outside there was another resounding crash
02:35:24.72 --> 02:35:30.56 of bombs followed by curses perhaps I was better off in here it was bloody awful for everyone
02:35:30.56 --> 02:35:37.84 everywhere outside the situation was getting completely out of hand further enemy reinforcements
02:35:37.84 --> 02:35:43.04 were mustering around the perimeter in the form of powerfully armed tanks from the SS Panzer
02:35:43.04 --> 02:35:46.80 divisions with long barreled high explosives and armor piercing shells
02:35:48.64 --> 02:35:53.44 the passage where I lay ran from front to rear the hotel and I was facing the rear with a
02:35:53.44 --> 02:35:57.84 grandstand view of the battle through a gaping hole in the wall where once there had been a window
02:35:58.80 --> 02:36:03.76 now and again one of our men would break cover to stock the enemy and the enemy would repeat
02:36:03.76 --> 02:36:10.56 the process with the multiple accompaniment of shell burst tank fire machine gun fire curses and
02:36:10.56 --> 02:36:18.24 yelps of pain I heard the ominous sound of an approaching tank I couldn't see it but the
02:36:18.24 --> 02:36:24.40 squeaking of its caterpillar wheels grew even louder then it came into view it's great gun
02:36:24.40 --> 02:36:31.20 traversing from right to left picking its way through the trees it stopped for a few minutes to
02:36:31.20 --> 02:36:38.000 feel its way and then the gun barked out sending a shell across my front to an unseen target
02:36:39.36 --> 02:36:43.20 the other wounded were lying huddled together trying to afford each other protection
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.36 the floor was littered with debris blood and glass and there was an incest and wind and explosion
02:36:49.36 --> 02:36:54.32 of mortar bombs together with the shrieking crash of artillery vibrating the very foundations of the
02:36:54.32 --> 02:37:00.72 building which I thought when it's some point tumbled down I don't know what time it was when the
02:37:00.72 --> 02:37:06.88 shelling and gun fire stopped but after a den of the last six days it felt very strange to suddenly
02:37:07.84 --> 02:37:14.000 be so much quieter there were still spasmotic firing in the distance and a little shelling
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:21.04 but nothing to worry about we began to converse more freely gone on strike Jerry one man almost
02:37:21.04 --> 02:37:28.08 shouted except that his head half his mouth bandaged from a shell splinter wound nah he's packed
02:37:28.08 --> 02:37:34.80 up as Jerry and buggered off a cockney put in the glider pilot was more cautious crafty saw
02:37:34.80 --> 02:37:41.28 is the hunt he's got something up his sleeve then I saw men being carried downstairs with great
02:37:41.28 --> 02:37:49.12 activity going on outside but not of battle two medics picked me up both of them silent and not
02:37:49.12 --> 02:37:56.64 looking to please where to now I asked the Elizabeth hospital one told me the enemy had overrun us
02:37:56.64 --> 02:38:12.32 and was calling the shots so the Germans were now in control he gets taken out south outside
02:38:12.32 --> 02:38:18.80 was a ghastly site with the fallen dead of both our sides lying where they had gone down
02:38:19.84 --> 02:38:24.72 British and German medical orderlies were putting the wounded into jeeps and various other vehicles
02:38:24.72 --> 02:38:30.16 including two small vans improvised as makeshift ambulances three of us stretcher cases were
02:38:30.16 --> 02:38:35.60 loaded into a small open German lorry with shallow sides which would prevent us from bouncing off
02:38:35.60 --> 02:38:45.52 and transit there was just enough room for five walking wounded now they're on this drive we all
02:38:45.52 --> 02:38:50.32 had shattered bones of some sort which made us cry out and pain during the rough ride in this
02:38:50.32 --> 02:38:56.40 antico anticoated lorry and I was still more than pleased when it finally came to a stand still
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:01.60 at journeys end at the hospital there had clearly been heavy fighting and as spent cartridges could
02:39:01.60 --> 02:39:08.24 see be seen littering the floor and entranceway I heard that familiar voice of a friend what the
02:39:08.24 --> 02:39:14.80 hell are you doing on that stretcher scrounging for a lift I went to answer but nothing came out
02:39:14.80 --> 02:39:23.28 can you imagine you go to the hospital and the floor has got bullets chasing all over it
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:30.32 word got around that the whole show was over and I began to wonder what really went wrong
02:39:30.88 --> 02:39:36.48 the battle had been lost but it had been some fight as mortar sergeant Dick winning him later
02:39:36.48 --> 02:39:44.64 Riley remarked we may have lost the battle at our nm but we did come in second it should be noted
02:39:44.64 --> 02:39:49.52 that there had not only been a great loss of life in this battle but also massive local
02:39:49.52 --> 02:39:58.000 destruction with one or one in four houses totally destroyed in most of the remainder badly damaged
02:40:02.40 --> 02:40:08.88 and so again you know I talked about the scene the different sides of the Germans and you know
02:40:08.88 --> 02:40:14.40 we already saw some of the Germans the prisoners being second by what the kind of civilian
02:40:14.40 --> 02:40:19.92 casualties were taking places they evacuated done Kirk the the Germans that were firing inside
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:24.24 the hospital and then when they get told by an unarmed you know leader hey get out of here there's
02:40:24.24 --> 02:40:32.40 okay fine they're grumpy but they leave just the fact that these the patients are the wounded are
02:40:32.40 --> 02:40:39.76 getting treated actually pretty well so they end up in this sort of makeshift hospital
02:40:41.44 --> 02:40:47.12 South African orthopedic surgeon captain Alexander Lippman castle was going to see me
02:40:47.12 --> 02:40:51.92 he commanded one of the surgical teams of the 16 pair of field ambulance I was thankful that I was
02:40:51.92 --> 02:40:57.28 not going to have a German butcher I had seen the end result of a German doctor's amputation of a
02:40:57.28 --> 02:41:02.88 man's foot crudely almost guillotine and without anesthetic I was carried into a large room with
02:41:02.88 --> 02:41:07.20 medical apparatus everywhere trowlies and tables laden with all sorts of instruments bandages field
02:41:07.20 --> 02:41:12.96 dressing in splints I was placed on a hard narrow table about four feet from the ground in the distance
02:41:12.96 --> 02:41:18.40 I could hear the sound of gunfire and German flock which meant that our aircraft were in the vicinity
02:41:19.28 --> 02:41:24.48 the anesthesiists put up had his needle at the ready and medics were preparing for the operation
02:41:24.48 --> 02:41:29.92 when there was a noise rather like a giant balloon having air released and then a terrific explosion
02:41:31.12 --> 02:41:35.68 with a very quick presence of mind one medic threw a blanket over me and shielded me from the
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:42.64 blast with his own body as shattered glass fell in small pieces and slivers all over the operating theater
02:41:43.92 --> 02:41:49.60 then all went quiet again and the blanket was pulled carefully to reveal yours truly with popping
02:41:49.60 --> 02:41:52.80 eyes my treatment had to wait another day while the place was cleaned up
02:41:52.80 --> 02:41:57.60 fortunately for me the next visit was uninterrupted the wound was cleaned and redressed
02:41:58.24 --> 02:42:05.60 and I had my first plaster cast put on and so like I said it seems like at this point it's
02:42:05.60 --> 02:42:12.48 it's relatively civilized I mean if you can forgive a bomb exploding while you're about to get surgery
02:42:12.48 --> 02:42:18.88 but relatively civilized compared to what they'd been through at one point there's an SS officer
02:42:18.88 --> 02:42:24.64 comes in and they kind of go through the different individuals there and they finally get to him
02:42:24.64 --> 02:42:29.76 and when he tells him he's an airborne guy they say you're going to prison a work app
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:36.000 and he says here was September 28th there was a 28th of September when German orderly
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000 he's carried me out of the hospital not so carefully as our own medics and I had to hang on
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.72 to the sides of the stretchers we descended the stone steps at the entrance to avoid sliding off
02:42:44.72 --> 02:42:54.96 and now he gets transported again this time he ends up at the Villem 3 concern barracks
02:42:58.72 --> 02:43:05.92 we were given iron beds with straw filled pillows and the floors were dirty there was no
02:43:05.92 --> 02:43:12.64 heating and only a meager supply of medical necessities and then at one point a doctor or or
02:43:12.64 --> 02:43:21.68 I presume he was entered the room accompanied by a rotten fear of the SS medical corps the stench
02:43:21.68 --> 02:43:27.12 from my wound caused disapproval on the face of the doctor and grabbing my big toe with his finger
02:43:27.12 --> 02:43:32.16 he slowly raised the leg which began to bend at the wound beneath the knee were both the
02:43:32.16 --> 02:43:37.04 Tibia and Fibia were broken stopping he peered at the wound inquisitively
02:43:37.04 --> 02:43:42.72 D-Mind that hurts I told him where upon he simply released the hold of my leg and let it fall in the
02:43:42.72 --> 02:43:49.68 hard table instantly turning to go looking at me in the eyes with his statistic expression as he did so
02:43:51.04 --> 02:43:58.000 you bastard square headed shite hawk I said I couldn't care less if he didn't understand the phrase
02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:03.12 he just raised an eyebrow with an inquiring looking departed while I returned to my private world of pain
02:44:03.12 --> 02:44:11.20 then the medics came back with that infernal SS guard and redress and repostured my leg
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.20 so like I said there's I mean it's not great treatment but I mean let's face it he's alive
02:44:20.24 --> 02:44:24.32 and he goes on here I was at the barracks for a little more than a week
02:44:24.88 --> 02:44:31.44 when one morning I was prepared for yet another move this time a short journey to the juliana hospital in
02:44:31.44 --> 02:44:39.92 apple doom apple dorn my stay at juliana hospital is going to be the longest and best as far as
02:44:39.92 --> 02:44:44.56 medical care goes go the hospital staff with Dutch doctors and nurses helped by our own doctors
02:44:44.56 --> 02:44:48.64 and orderlies and the Germans left us well alone to fend for our own medical requirements
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:58.08 like I said that seems fairly civilized to me and they're trying to help him out and here we go
02:44:58.08 --> 02:45:03.44 it was decided to apply a gadget called a Kirchner wire extension to my leg as both bones were broken
02:45:03.44 --> 02:45:08.96 below the knee the theory was to stretch the leg and try to marry the bones in the correct position
02:45:08.96 --> 02:45:14.56 under an injection of evapand a steel bar was shot through my ankle bone to act as an anchor
02:45:15.12 --> 02:45:20.96 a steel cable was then attached to the anchor and to a pulley apparatus below the foot of the bed
02:45:20.96 --> 02:45:26.32 weights were added each day to steadily stretch the leg otherwise I was told I would be left with a
02:45:26.32 --> 02:45:32.000 two inch shortening necessitating the use of a club boot at a later date which I didn't much
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.60 care for but my general condition my general and local condition had regressed considerably
02:45:38.24 --> 02:45:47.52 and I was at my lowest ab I was now wishing that I could see the end of this confounded uses
02:45:47.52 --> 02:45:55.44 lump of decaying flesh and bone on the 19th of November I got my reluctant wish and my leg was
02:45:55.44 --> 02:46:03.28 amputated by major Peter Smith of the 133rd parachute field ambulance as I later learned it was
02:46:03.28 --> 02:46:09.84 not a moment too soon prior to the operation I had been regarded as a hopeless case one of those
02:46:09.84 --> 02:46:17.04 certain of not lasting after surgery however I made such an amazingly quick recovery that I was
02:46:17.04 --> 02:46:23.28 back to life and sitting out of bed only a week later the medical orderlies could not do enough for us
02:46:23.28 --> 02:46:29.28 from baste of fetching bed pants carrying patients from the bed to the loo and back again soothing
02:46:29.28 --> 02:46:34.32 and dying soothing the dying or reading a book for those two weeks are exhausted to do so for
02:46:34.32 --> 02:46:40.16 themselves they were always on call all hours of the day and night I wondered when they managed
02:46:40.16 --> 02:46:46.000 to eat or sleep I asked one who was passing with a bottle in his hand he answered quite cheerfully
02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:55.36 oh we get forty winks now and then with snack in between so there you go I mean almost one sentence
02:46:56.80 --> 02:47:05.68 no two sentences he was wishing that he could get this decaying hunk of flesh off of his body
02:47:05.68 --> 02:47:10.48 and the next time the next sentence is got reacted that's that's that's how much
02:47:10.48 --> 02:47:20.16 that's that's that's that's that's been as matter of fact as you can get I guess is what I'm going with this
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:33.04 this is a one last little section of this a Polish parah who had dropped at Arknem
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:38.56 was opposite me in the corner of the world he'd been caught up badly and was having a rough time
02:47:38.56 --> 02:47:43.28 a German military clergyman kept calling to say prayers and finally came to administer the last
02:47:43.28 --> 02:47:50.56 rights as he stood there in his dark olive green uniform black jack boots and belt
02:47:50.56 --> 02:47:56.64 peaked cap under his arm I scrutinized his close cropped bull neck and square jaw I could not
02:47:56.64 --> 02:48:03.28 help a notice and thought how strange that he wore a gunholster a man of the cloth with a pistol
02:48:03.28 --> 02:48:16.08 in a hospital what next so he talks about you know the care that he gets he starts getting moved
02:48:16.08 --> 02:48:19.76 around a lot the Germans kept shipping us out as soon as they thought we were fit enough to travel
02:48:19.76 --> 02:48:25.04 and once again I found myself in a truck this time heading to the rail station at Apple Dorn
02:48:25.04 --> 02:48:32.000 where we pulled up alongside of and boarded red cross train and of course this stuff just never
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:38.32 gets easy daylight came with a German doing is nut and shouting spit fire actone spit fire actone
02:48:39.04 --> 02:48:43.20 I watched a lone spit fire turn and fly parallel to the train at about a hundred feet with the same
02:48:43.20 --> 02:48:49.04 distance from the train it was quite cheeky I thought the pilot was having a real close look to
02:48:49.04 --> 02:48:53.44 make sure it was a hospital train I could see clearly as goggles were off in white scarf
02:48:53.44 --> 02:48:59.04 and felt like giving him a wave as he disappeared behind some pine trees we were now in Germany with
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:04.80 snow-covered mountains and forests of fur log cabins dotted here and there making it also pitch
02:49:04.80 --> 02:49:11.76 a risk as nightfall came we halted at a dismal looking place a small town I think unfortunately
02:49:11.76 --> 02:49:18.64 the luxury was now over and we were ushered off the train in a collection on a collection of
02:49:18.64 --> 02:49:26.64 crutches of varying lengths that were produced and given to the leg amputees so they get end up in this
02:49:26.64 --> 02:49:33.68 like just junk place we were all a bit under the weather with the added unpleasantness of an
02:49:33.68 --> 02:49:41.36 amputation one lathe and arm and a hand missing another two arms off and most like myself had lost
02:49:41.36 --> 02:49:47.36 the leg one poor fellow was the worst for blisters on his one and only foot we had a wounded medic
02:49:47.36 --> 02:49:53.28 who was with us and did all he could to help with medical minimal medical supplies we had only paper
02:49:53.28 --> 02:49:58.48 bandages it was not the best of nights on the cold stone floor but I somehow slept others were
02:49:58.48 --> 02:50:03.12 not so first fortunate and one chap did not even live to see the rest of the journey remaining
02:50:03.12 --> 02:50:11.68 motionless the next morning as we were roused by the guards so this transport continues gets on a
02:50:11.68 --> 02:50:19.60 train finally ends up at another place the snow is quite thick we pulled in what looked like a
02:50:19.60 --> 02:50:24.80 school in a small town near Munster three of the yanks of myself were told to get out and then
02:50:24.80 --> 02:50:31.12 a lorry carried on its way leaving a standing in the crisp snow a voice called welcome buddy come in
02:50:31.76 --> 02:50:38.96 he's a big American from Indiana called Marvin Adams inside he showed us to a room on the left
02:50:38.96 --> 02:50:46.96 grab yourself a pillow and bed down here I'll do yours bud he said looking me up and down
02:50:46.96 --> 02:50:52.000 how'd your manage that fella put the best foot forward at the wrong time I answered
02:50:52.72 --> 02:50:57.92 oh well the St. the Ritz but will have fun he said I wonder what he meant by that
02:50:58.80 --> 02:51:03.68 always good to be that person with a good attitude we even when you're an adam prisoner of war camp
02:51:07.92 --> 02:51:11.12 going on here the Germans guards were not existing except at night
02:51:12.32 --> 02:51:16.24 as we were all severely wounded there was thick snow outside they were obviously not worried about
02:51:16.24 --> 02:51:27.76 a massive scape food was sparse but regular and then again more moving I was just getting used to this
02:51:27.76 --> 02:51:32.24 place when word went round that Jerry was moving us some of us maybe for repatriation
02:51:33.12 --> 02:51:38.88 having only one pin meaning leg I thought I stood a good chance to be in on this then early one
02:51:38.88 --> 02:51:44.000 morning three yanks two Russians in myself were ushered to a truck and taken on a passenger train
02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:48.80 in which we travel the few miles only to detrain again perhaps to get another connection
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:54.72 for as our yet for our as yet to be undisclosed location destination
02:51:56.64 --> 02:52:02.32 and then they get off that train they get on another train they get on this other train
02:52:02.32 --> 02:52:08.48 after shunting around a bit and hitching up to another train we rolled off again it was dusk
02:52:08.48 --> 02:52:15.28 cold and pretty dimo all told then someone struck up our version of the song bless him all
02:52:18.32 --> 02:52:24.72 and their version of the song was salt them all salt them all belong in the short and the tall
02:52:24.72 --> 02:52:31.20 salt all the sergeants and the W.O. ones salt all the corpus and their bastard sons
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:37.12 for we're saying goodbye to them all as back to their billets they crawl you'll get no promotion
02:52:37.12 --> 02:52:46.88 aside of the ocean so cheer up me lads saw them all and he says it seemed we had joined a group of
02:52:46.88 --> 02:52:58.08 British soldiers by this was by way of an introduction they finally make it to bremen
02:52:58.56 --> 02:53:02.64 we pulled in slowly and as the train came to a stop there were sounds of doors opening in the
02:53:02.64 --> 02:53:06.80 hustle and bustle of people getting off and making their way along the platform and then it happened
02:53:06.80 --> 02:53:11.84 an air raid warning wind out civilian military personnel immediately began scurrying about in the
02:53:11.84 --> 02:53:17.36 military I noticed did not hesitate to shove anyone else out of their way a little shot at the
02:53:17.36 --> 02:53:21.28 German military the civilians are getting pushed out of the way so they can get to cover
02:53:23.12 --> 02:53:28.72 the air was humming with aircraft american Boeing b-17 flying fortresses and our guards
02:53:28.72 --> 02:53:32.72 quick in their step way ahead of us periodically turning to beckon us to hurry it up
02:53:32.72 --> 02:53:37.76 we entered the shelter being enough for about a hundred people and after a lot of pushing and
02:53:37.76 --> 02:53:42.88 shoving settled among amid the gliers and remarks thrown our way I was happy to let it happen
02:53:42.88 --> 02:53:47.76 but somehow I'd been pushed and guided into a corner of the shelter away from the door if a bomb
02:53:47.76 --> 02:53:53.36 lands two near the the Germans take it blast take the blast and cushion any effect on us I thought
02:53:54.08 --> 02:53:59.76 there was a wooden batch fixed to the wall I dropped to it exhausted three guards it spread out between us
02:53:59.76 --> 02:54:05.44 and other occupants and when the bombing started in earnest the shelter shook I was sure
02:54:05.44 --> 02:54:10.08 wanted landed close outside because I felt it's draft reminding me of being blown off my feet
02:54:10.08 --> 02:54:15.92 in North Africa only that time it was just 50 feet away everyone fell silent as the drone of
02:54:15.92 --> 02:54:22.000 aircraft and wind and crash a bombs went on with ever increasing ferocity for a good hour before
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:28.72 dying down to a steady drumming and an occasional distant explosion I must admit I always think of
02:54:28.72 --> 02:54:38.56 these bombing runs as taking like maybe 10 minutes but we're talking about a good hour
02:54:40.48 --> 02:54:45.12 people began to chatter this is once everything's kind of faded people began to chatter
02:54:45.12 --> 02:54:50.64 as interfered dispersed and external barvato took over I could hear the gnashing of teeth
02:54:51.92 --> 02:54:56.24 glances accompanying finger pointing in our direction the crowd is getting rest if in a big
02:54:56.24 --> 02:55:03.92 man started pouring forth with words of abuse a big frow about 40 years old worked her way near
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.72 to us until she was only a couple feet away I felt the murt moisture of her spiddlesty argued with
02:55:08.72 --> 02:55:13.28 the guards about the privilege we had being allowed to be in the same shelter as the German people
02:55:13.84 --> 02:55:18.40 I gathered that was a crux of the matter that was the crux of the matter at this point a heavy
02:55:18.40 --> 02:55:24.24 booted foot came out and started propelling my way I parried firmly with my right hand and the boot
02:55:24.24 --> 02:55:30.56 just brushed my balls coming to a harmless glancing blow on my left thigh the guards stood firm
02:55:30.56 --> 02:55:34.56 restraining the woman and trying to calm everyone down it was only then that I noticed
02:55:36.96 --> 02:55:44.48 a familiar sound in French our guards were Frenchmen constricted in the German army
02:55:44.48 --> 02:55:51.12 anyway they saved my nuts from being cracked there must have been another hours wait at the
02:55:51.12 --> 02:55:56.80 station another back going to transfer again there must have been another hours waited the station until
02:55:56.80 --> 02:56:03.92 I an old army type lorry with solid tires turned up or sorry they were waiting for truck
02:56:03.92 --> 02:56:07.84 I couldn't care less at this stage provided I didn't have to hobble on crutches before long
02:56:07.84 --> 02:56:12.80 I saw the large POW camp ahead with its eight foot high wire fences and guards platform
02:56:12.80 --> 02:56:18.48 sticking up like store thumbs all around there was a collection of dingy looking huts dotting the interior
02:56:18.48 --> 02:56:25.52 the lorry slowed at the gate and the senior guard jumped down through the hand to go through the
02:56:25.52 --> 02:56:31.92 handing over ceremony then the big wood and wire gates creed open and the lorry jerked into the
02:56:31.92 --> 02:56:39.04 compound where out we tumbled I was exhausted and sweating as if I just come out of a Turkish bath
02:56:39.04 --> 02:56:44.24 my stump was throbbing I stayed lying on the ground where I landed managing to support myself on
02:56:44.24 --> 02:56:50.96 one elbow while the rest of the party sat knelt or remained standing with the aid of their crutches
02:56:51.84 --> 02:56:55.52 I didn't want a welcoming committee but wished that someone would show us where to go
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:00.16 one of the guards was busy having a chat and laughed with his mate eventually he gave us the go ahead
02:57:00.16 --> 02:57:04.96 and the party moved off slowly and weirdly I found myself left behind I tried to get up but I could
02:57:04.96 --> 02:57:08.72 not muster enough strength to make it so I started crawling dragging the crutches
02:57:08.72 --> 02:57:14.16 I'd only manage five or six yards when I heard voices and saw two pairs of gated boots come
02:57:14.80 --> 02:57:21.04 come on me old mate a voice said we'll give you a lift on which they lifted me with ease and
02:57:21.04 --> 02:57:25.76 carried me I don't know how far I didn't even get a glimpse of their faces to say thanks
02:57:28.88 --> 02:57:34.56 sinking down onto a straw mattress I just slept and slept for the next two days when I woke
02:57:34.56 --> 02:57:42.16 I found that I was in Stolog X1B in Saxony along with a large number of other airborne men
02:57:42.16 --> 02:57:48.80 it was not long before I contracted more complaints to add to my already sorry condition
02:57:48.80 --> 02:57:54.80 Lysen bugs were in abundance in my hut the nights were the worst the iron stove was stoked right
02:57:54.80 --> 02:57:59.36 up at night and the heat was awful with all the doors and windows shut tight urine buckets
02:57:59.36 --> 02:58:04.16 would fill to the brim and no time making the stench nauseous I went down with dysentery
02:58:04.16 --> 02:58:10.24 plurzy and scarlet fever which together with my amputation meant that I did not feel all that good
02:58:13.84 --> 02:58:23.60 red is hard as nails if I had wanted to die I would have but fortunately that didn't enter my head
02:58:24.96 --> 02:58:31.36 little key note as I read that I thought hmm let's think about that
02:58:31.36 --> 02:58:38.64 if you want to die if you want to give up you there's the time but luckily fortunately for him
02:58:38.64 --> 02:58:42.64 that thought did not enter his head after a short time promising news
02:58:43.60 --> 02:58:48.64 again I'm jumping ahead like this is what we're talking every little thing that he just talked
02:58:48.64 --> 02:58:55.60 about is a nightmare and he's got him all at the same time it's been a while since we talked about
02:58:55.60 --> 02:59:03.28 lice on the podcast yeah we've been missing out on that one we think lice is no big deal
02:59:03.28 --> 02:59:07.04 because your kid gets it and then you get some special little medicine from the store and then you put
02:59:07.04 --> 02:59:14.16 it in their hair or you shave their head and and either way prom solved these guys are got it
02:59:15.20 --> 02:59:23.84 and there's no way to get rid of it this is by the way wall that got dysentery and plurzy
02:59:23.84 --> 02:59:33.04 and scarlet fever and an amputation however fast forward a little bit after a short time promising
02:59:33.04 --> 02:59:37.52 news I was told that I was going to be repatriated I boarded yet another train no sooner than we
02:59:37.52 --> 02:59:41.52 set off that there was a terrific woosh in the train stopped in the middle nowhere I could hear the
02:59:41.52 --> 02:59:46.48 gutteral tang twang of German civilians as they ran hell for leather on each side of the train
02:59:46.48 --> 02:59:50.32 to take cover from what must have been our own aircraft overhead one of the guards just
02:59:50.32 --> 02:59:54.88 the moose and left it to us looking down to the track I saw that it was much too high for me to jump
02:59:54.88 --> 03:00:02.48 with only one leg the some of our party of eight jumped and took cover I found my pants and don't
03:00:02.48 --> 03:00:08.96 know whether it was fright or the dysentery that was still with me the planes returned they were
03:00:08.96 --> 03:00:14.96 to rocket firing RAF typhoons which specialized in ground attack I recognized the sound as they
03:00:14.96 --> 03:00:19.60 got nearer there was another woosh and then another followed by an ear splitting explosion
03:00:19.60 --> 03:00:24.32 the carriage shook so violently that I thought we were going to topple over as always in such a
03:00:24.32 --> 03:00:30.24 task it was over in no time with such a tax it was over in no time and all of a suddenly peaceful again
03:00:33.44 --> 03:00:37.92 so they have to go and repair this train and then finally we had reached a snug little village
03:00:37.92 --> 03:00:46.56 called Myzberg on the German side of the border with Belgium and once again we see some nicer
03:00:46.56 --> 03:00:50.80 treatment our first job was to be cleaned up and we were taken in pairs into the shower I was
03:00:50.80 --> 03:00:54.40 asked to remove all personal items from my pockets and all clothing was to be cleaned and few
03:00:54.40 --> 03:00:59.20 amigated don't worry you'll get everything back and English medic told me here put this on it was
03:00:59.20 --> 03:01:03.92 a sort of cotton smock which tied in the back was just long enough to cover to the knee first in
03:01:03.92 --> 03:01:10.000 came a great big American with the same garb with forms like tree branches he lifted me bodily with
03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:18.08 the ease of samps and himself mind you I was down from 14 stone to just over eight since last
03:01:18.08 --> 03:01:26.56 September and to translate that into American English he weighed 196 pounds in September and now
03:01:26.56 --> 03:01:36.96 he weighs 112 on reaching the shower is made ask can you stand on one leg bud sure I said
03:01:36.96 --> 03:01:42.16 samps and it taken his smock off and proceeded to bathe me while herkilly steadyed me I was carried
03:01:42.16 --> 03:01:48.72 back to a most luxurious bed with white sheets God knows where the when they scrounge the sheets
03:01:48.72 --> 03:01:53.44 but trust the yanks there were approximately 40 wounded there a mixture of English French and
03:01:53.44 --> 03:01:59.28 American with four American and two English orderlies one of the walking wounded act that is a
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:05.84 cook all the others doing menial tasks they did not mind though so he's in this pretty
03:02:07.52 --> 03:02:14.80 car can I even say let's say let's just say and improved situation and improved situation is what is
03:02:14.80 --> 03:02:24.08 he and that goes on a little bit or even he calls it the luxury things began to live in
03:02:24.08 --> 03:02:31.04 up outside the rumbling in the distance grunier and groups of bejragled weary looking Germans
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:37.60 plotted through the village the wounded born by horse and cart field guns were manhandled
03:02:37.60 --> 03:02:42.88 the luxury of any motorized transport being afforded to senior officers only who clearly
03:02:42.88 --> 03:02:50.32 wished to withdraw in his dignified manner as possible leaving hunter officers to do all the
03:02:50.32 --> 03:02:56.16 donkey work along with the shoots and and suffer all the humiliation of being seen by their own
03:02:56.16 --> 03:03:03.68 countrymen it was a pathetic sight like a cutting from the first world war film archives as the
03:03:03.68 --> 03:03:11.20 dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and tanks was very near so he's seeing the Germans
03:03:11.20 --> 03:03:16.16 kind of walking back he's seeing the officers in the vehicles the German officers in the vehicles
03:03:16.16 --> 03:03:26.56 and the German troops walking or being carried if they were wounded and years tank activity right
03:03:26.56 --> 03:03:30.16 which is kind of an indication where you have tank activity but you see people withdrawing with horses
03:03:30.16 --> 03:03:34.56 and garages that's an indication that perhaps the tanks that we're hearing are good friendly
03:03:37.28 --> 03:03:41.12 as dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and the tanks was very near
03:03:41.12 --> 03:03:45.68 you could hear the squeak of the tanks wheels rubbing against the caterpillar track
03:03:45.68 --> 03:03:51.44 thirsty for lubrication edging and shunting into position for the impending advance in the village
03:03:53.84 --> 03:04:00.000 that noise that a tank makes in the city is just wind well who is the awesome
03:04:01.12 --> 03:04:06.16 and and it's also horrifying like these guys when they're hearing the German tanks outside when they're
03:04:06.16 --> 03:04:13.20 in that that battle whether about to be overrun the horror can't even imagine of tanks coming
03:04:13.20 --> 03:04:18.48 and now the joy which I got to experience some of the joy in the body of hey the tanks are coming
03:04:18.48 --> 03:04:25.52 it's glorious and god bless the tankers and here these guys feel in the same way the American
03:04:25.52 --> 03:04:32.72 orderlies were jubilant they're here lie me the yanks are here exploded Hank anyone who get up walk hop
03:04:32.72 --> 03:04:37.76 or propel themselves in some way momentarily forgot their wounds in discomfort they peered
03:04:37.76 --> 03:04:41.60 through the cracks and the doors through the windows I could not see anything from my window
03:04:41.60 --> 03:04:46.16 only the Nazi flag of the local garrison hanging listless like the enemy itself
03:04:46.96 --> 03:04:51.36 bill one of the english medics came gashing and not knowing which way to turn in his excitement
03:04:51.36 --> 03:04:55.60 there's hundreds of them there's hundreds of tanks out there bloody well hundreds of them
03:04:55.60 --> 03:05:03.12 Sherman tanks of general patterns armored division had encircled the village in the early hours
03:05:03.12 --> 03:05:08.88 of that morning and were in a very advantageous position as we were in the valley and they were on the
03:05:08.88 --> 03:05:17.68 high ground every gun would have its own selected target with orders to open fire if fired upon
03:05:17.68 --> 03:05:23.20 thankfully the tanks played a waiting game with the non-existent enemy because the because unknown
03:05:23.20 --> 03:05:30.48 to the Americans the birds had flown an American scout car ventured cautiously toward
03:05:30.48 --> 03:05:36.000 the village on molested it reached the outskirts scanning the bridge buildings where white flags were
03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:43.04 protruding no sign of the enemy still in view of the tanks on the hill it became bolder and
03:05:43.04 --> 03:05:49.76 crews gently into the village our makeshift hospital with a painted red cross on the roof
03:05:49.76 --> 03:05:56.32 must have been in view of the scout car now all these goings on were being shouted by one of the
03:05:56.32 --> 03:06:00.96 medics in the passageway for the benefit of all those like me who could not see for themselves so he's
03:06:00.96 --> 03:06:08.24 getting a play by play the scout car came to a stop it's occupants clutching their automatic
03:06:08.24 --> 03:06:15.44 at the ready they must have spotted someone step carefully into view that person was a medic
03:06:15.44 --> 03:06:21.12 with a red cross arm band Hank the orderly from Ohio he was about a hundred yards from the
03:06:21.12 --> 03:06:26.72 scout car and they stealthily approached each other Hank not wishing to be mistaken for a German
03:06:26.72 --> 03:06:36.88 ruse though in the scout car not wishing to fall for any trick as they drew closer the realization
03:06:36.88 --> 03:06:43.52 dawned that they were brothers a wireless call was immediately sent to the tanks on the skyline
03:06:43.52 --> 03:06:50.48 and in minutes the village was alive to their rumble as they thundered on through leaving an
03:06:50.48 --> 03:06:58.48 accurate smell of oil and exhaust fumes I was almost home
03:07:04.48 --> 03:07:08.48 and you know I got to that point in the book and I was like well that's that's where you stop
03:07:08.48 --> 03:07:18.40 and it's definitely a good place to stop but let's take that as a stop
03:07:20.96 --> 03:07:29.20 that incredible glory of seeing the Americans seeing patents armored division rolling
03:07:31.28 --> 03:07:33.12 and knowing that he was almost home
03:07:33.12 --> 03:07:42.24 but there are some things to think about and he covers them in the epilogue here he says the
03:07:42.24 --> 03:07:49.04 casualties in the arnum area alone were eight thousand airborne killed the wounded captured
03:07:49.04 --> 03:07:57.68 or missing including poles plus more than four hundred RAF pilots in crew
03:07:57.68 --> 03:08:06.24 there were 750 Dutch civilians and underground fighters killed at least two thousand five hundred
03:08:06.24 --> 03:08:15.52 Germans and in the following winter of 1944 to 1945 some 200 thousand Dutch died of starvation
03:08:16.80 --> 03:08:24.000 so it's so it's important to understand that these you see you see this through one man's eyes
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:32.24 but that thousands in fact hundreds of thousands were affected by this particular battle
03:08:36.32 --> 03:08:40.72 and again that might be a good place to stop but there's another note here he talks about
03:08:40.72 --> 03:08:47.84 several years later I visited the place of thinking if you will of that great man and founder of
03:08:47.84 --> 03:08:56.64 the parachute regimen Winston Churchill the war rooms situated far below ground at the
03:08:56.64 --> 03:09:04.000 treasury chambers in Westminster the existence of these a war in room war in of rooms was a well kept
03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:09.44 secret during the warriors the tour was fascinating everything remained exactly as it had been back
03:09:09.44 --> 03:09:15.04 then I sat in Churchill's chair in front of me on the desk printed on a black card
03:09:15.04 --> 03:09:23.76 printed in black on a card the words of Queen Victoria in this house we never speak of defeat
03:09:31.04 --> 03:09:37.28 in this house we never speak of defeat and he goes on in the toilet there was a red telephone
03:09:37.28 --> 03:09:44.64 a direct line to President Roosevelt in Washington in the visiting ministers room I opened a
03:09:44.64 --> 03:09:52.000 book entitled World War II on the Sicily landings and saw a training shot of members of my 11th
03:09:52.000 --> 03:10:02.32 S.A.S. Battalion to the four in the lineup were Harry Bance Corporal Hudson Jimmy Metcalf
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:04.56 and myself
03:10:04.56 --> 03:10:18.64 down here beneath Westminster I surrounded I am sure by a dedicated team Churchill did his job
03:10:18.64 --> 03:10:26.48 extremely well I would like to think that I did my best alongside other leopards,
03:10:26.48 --> 03:10:44.88 lions and tigers of the first parachute brigade and again I really didn't get into the fact that
03:10:44.88 --> 03:10:49.92 at some at one point there there are call signs their code names had been the leopards lines and
03:10:49.92 --> 03:10:57.60 tigers that's what their the different battalions were called could be a good place to stop on
03:10:57.60 --> 03:11:02.000 a goal a little bit further this is actually in the preface of this book and he says when the war ended because
03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:11.84 this is he survived he was home when the war ended I found it a little difficult initially
03:11:12.64 --> 03:11:18.88 knuckling down to civilian life the letter from the government saying you are now a civilian
03:11:18.88 --> 03:11:29.20 seemed so sudden I couldn't face the prospect of an office job so I tried manufacturing making
03:11:29.20 --> 03:11:34.24 handbags before joining my brother-in-law John in his landscape gardening business and then
03:11:34.24 --> 03:11:40.88 branch branching out on my own in the same line of work having an artificial leg didn't help
03:11:41.76 --> 03:11:48.32 but I didn't let it hinder me then the limb fitting center at gilling him kindly reinforced
03:11:48.32 --> 03:11:59.04 my artificial knee for kneeling several times I got a BSA motorbike and side car and had the gear
03:11:59.04 --> 03:12:11.92 is modified to operate by hand instead of foot I built my own house you do the best you can
03:12:11.92 --> 03:12:25.28 again again I mean hey found a little rough to guess what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to work
03:12:25.28 --> 03:12:29.68 I'm gonna start a business I'm gonna build a house I'm gonna drive a motorbike around the
03:12:29.68 --> 03:12:46.08 country with a side car you do the best you can and I also wanted to say that he wasn't alone
03:12:46.08 --> 03:12:52.72 he obviously need that side car for someone and I'm quite sure that that was one of the
03:12:52.72 --> 03:13:04.08 dedications of the book is for Betty Francis Regis wife who who as he puts it helped me so much
03:13:07.84 --> 03:13:16.08 and the last thing I'll say the last thing I'll read from this book I should say is the
03:13:16.08 --> 03:13:36.72 dedication and he says I dedicate this book to all my airborne friends who never came back
03:13:38.16 --> 03:13:45.04 whose actions made it possible for me and other airborne friends to enjoy over
03:13:45.04 --> 03:14:02.000 70 years of living and that is well that's the parts I'm gonna read from this book but
03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:14.08 um red shirt is died on January 29th 2016 94 years old
03:14:20.80 --> 03:14:27.92 he was the last surviving member of the original first parachute battalion the last of
03:14:27.92 --> 03:14:35.92 those initial 500 men that took that step forward and volunteered for parachute and command
03:14:35.92 --> 03:14:46.24 no training in 1940 in the book the book which is called the memory indoors the book it's actually
03:14:46.24 --> 03:14:52.48 not available on Amazon it's not available in book stores I actually got it I got it from somebody that
03:14:52.48 --> 03:15:00.16 sent it to me and with no inscription in it it says he sent me a note it says dear jacco
03:15:01.04 --> 03:15:10.88 keep up the great work best wishes I believe it says Rick or Rich so that's where I got the book
03:15:10.88 --> 03:15:16.96 from luckily it was sent to me I wouldn't have known about it otherwise if you want to get this book
03:15:16.96 --> 03:15:25.76 which you should it's available from pilots publishing dot co dot uk and there's also a Facebook page
03:15:25.76 --> 03:15:33.60 the memory facebook dot com slash the memory indoors and as it says in the book
03:15:33.60 --> 03:15:43.52 the authors royalties in respect of this book will be donated to the parachute regiment charity
03:15:48.08 --> 03:16:01.68 and there you go another hero teaching us the sacred lesson that we must never forget that
03:16:01.68 --> 03:16:13.04 life is a gift and as rich Curtis tells us what you do with that is you do the best you care
03:16:19.04 --> 03:16:28.000 you do the best to that you care and with that echo echo Charles as I decompressed over here
03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:36.000 a little bit maybe got some ideas of how how we can be the best we can use what do you got for us
03:16:37.52 --> 03:16:47.12 I one of the many things that I took was I don't know if it was his attitude or if that's the
03:16:47.12 --> 03:16:53.92 culture or both you know could be a bit better and then that was the other guy right who was like
03:16:53.92 --> 03:17:01.92 could be a bit better do we do better yeah so on these terrible conditions right could be a bit
03:17:01.92 --> 03:17:08.000 oh oh you talk about the guy that says not too bad not too bad could be better could be better
03:17:09.04 --> 03:17:16.32 so you know like I said probably probably both right attitude plus culture so the attitude right
03:17:16.32 --> 03:17:23.44 one things when you go through adversity you can have that attitude not too bad not too bad could
03:17:23.44 --> 03:17:28.40 be better hey we're about to get overrun and there's a strong possibility we're going to get
03:17:28.40 --> 03:17:34.32 killed right not too bad not too bad could be better yeah could be better positive thought pattern
03:17:34.32 --> 03:17:39.52 there yeah it's kind of like well it's really a good news bad news yeah it's also a realistic view
03:17:39.52 --> 03:17:45.68 right yeah hey I'm still walking hey I still got ammunition yeah and by the way it's not not too bad
03:17:45.68 --> 03:17:50.40 means we don't have to do anything could be better though maybe there's some things we can work on
03:17:50.40 --> 03:17:55.84 yes yeah well I forget what movie it was when he's like I got good news and bad I think
03:17:55.84 --> 03:18:00.96 I'd been tango and cash I don't know maybe maybe not but anyway he said how are good news and bad news
03:18:01.60 --> 03:18:06.48 it was what's the bad news we're almost almost out of gas and he's like well what's the good
03:18:06.48 --> 03:18:13.84 news we're almost dead again so sad it's too good man so just you know speaking of attitudes good
03:18:13.84 --> 03:18:19.36 and bad what we're doing one of the many things is jujitsu okay so that's a really good news bad
03:18:19.36 --> 03:18:26.000 news scenario as well really what's the bad news bad news is you're gonna get choked
03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:34.48 from time to time I know this firsthand that's that's the bad news but the good news is you are
03:18:34.48 --> 03:18:42.72 exposed to an environment that will teach you how to choke others if the need may arise
03:18:42.72 --> 03:18:49.92 good yes so good news is you're getting choked are sorry bad news is you're getting choked
03:18:49.92 --> 03:18:54.40 yes good news is you're getting choked which means you're learning how to defend also choke
03:18:54.40 --> 03:18:59.44 of the people yes so if we're competitively well that could be good or bad news whatever
03:19:00.08 --> 03:19:05.52 so it's a matter of your attitude really how is your attitude like the on getting
03:19:05.52 --> 03:19:10.08 choked you know a lot of learning you know not a little learning what do you call it when you
03:19:10.08 --> 03:19:17.52 relearn something you know lessons lesson repetitive repetitive learning sessions hey it's not any
03:19:17.52 --> 03:19:21.60 not a new population you know it's repetitive well it is it's both I imagine that you get choked one
03:19:21.60 --> 03:19:27.92 time you'll never get choked again no no that's not the one that happens with the jujitsu so we are it
03:19:27.92 --> 03:19:34.64 sounds like jujitsu even though there's a negative possible thing right but it's not too bad not too bad
03:19:34.64 --> 03:19:40.48 it could be better if you try it yes start training the more you train the better you get so there you go
03:19:41.20 --> 03:19:44.80 anyway well we're training we're going to need a geek cause you're going to do geek what do you
03:19:44.80 --> 03:19:49.36 do not do geek well I guess that's possible but okay I'm not recommended no no I recommend
03:19:49.36 --> 03:19:54.48 are you going to fight people all the time that are just wearing shorts no no what if you get
03:19:54.48 --> 03:19:59.28 in a street fight okay if you get a street fight at the beach maybe what if you get a street fight
03:19:59.28 --> 03:20:06.48 at the supermarket yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you were taking the last you
03:20:06.48 --> 03:20:13.36 know and really that's like that's the last one you were broccoli yeah you don't like that you
03:20:13.36 --> 03:20:18.88 gotta fight them for something like this but that's even just one of the actually teeny tiny way
03:20:18.88 --> 03:20:23.04 of looking at it where it's like okay oh I see you're saying because the chance of you getting
03:20:23.04 --> 03:20:26.04 in actual fight are pretty low.
03:20:26.04 --> 03:20:28.52 If you're still trying to get a point,
03:20:28.52 --> 03:20:30.88 not to say that you should, not, you know,
03:20:30.88 --> 03:20:32.64 I'm not saying that, but they're pretty low.
03:20:32.64 --> 03:20:33.48 This is what I'm saying.
03:20:33.48 --> 03:20:35.96 And especially if you're gonna avoid
03:20:35.96 --> 03:20:38.12 getting a new fight, if you're smart,
03:20:38.12 --> 03:20:38.96 you're smart, yes.
03:20:38.96 --> 03:20:40.44 The problem is you can't always avoid it.
03:20:40.44 --> 03:20:43.20 You can maybe a situation and here's the deal.
03:20:43.20 --> 03:20:46.16 If you are forced into a situation
03:20:46.16 --> 03:20:48.12 that where you have to defend yourself
03:20:48.12 --> 03:20:51.08 and you don't know how the result is catastrophic.
03:20:51.08 --> 03:20:52.56 You have to be catastrophic.
03:20:52.56 --> 03:20:55.56 Why have that catastrophic possibility?
03:20:55.56 --> 03:20:57.16 Here's the deal.
03:20:57.16 --> 03:20:59.88 If that's the only reason you were training GJ2,
03:20:59.88 --> 03:21:02.76 if that was the only reason, it would be worth it.
03:21:02.76 --> 03:21:05.08 If that was the only reason, here's the deal.
03:21:05.08 --> 03:21:06.20 That's not the only reason.
03:21:06.20 --> 03:21:08.84 There's a thousand other reasons.
03:21:08.84 --> 03:21:11.08 There's an infinite more reasons, right?
03:21:11.08 --> 03:21:13.48 You're gonna get better conditioning.
03:21:13.48 --> 03:21:15.88 You're gonna get mental stimulus.
03:21:15.88 --> 03:21:17.76 You're gonna meet other human beings.
03:21:17.76 --> 03:21:20.92 You're gonna develop relationships and have friends.
03:21:20.92 --> 03:21:24.60 You're going to think you're gonna develop discipline
03:21:24.60 --> 03:21:26.04 in your life, right?
03:21:26.04 --> 03:21:27.04 This is a long list.
03:21:27.04 --> 03:21:28.48 I mean, this goes on.
03:21:28.48 --> 03:21:31.72 So even if the only thing you were gonna get
03:21:31.72 --> 03:21:34.20 was just you learn how to defend yourself.
03:21:34.20 --> 03:21:35.48 Totally worth it.
03:21:35.48 --> 03:21:37.04 Now not only are you gonna get it to defend yourself,
03:21:37.04 --> 03:21:41.16 you can be able to get these other collateral bonus things.
03:21:41.16 --> 03:21:44.36 Which by the way, some people in order to work
03:21:44.36 --> 03:21:45.92 their cardiovascular system,
03:21:45.92 --> 03:21:48.16 their ride in a spin bike somewhere.
03:21:48.16 --> 03:21:50.68 Someone else in order to work their flexibility
03:21:50.68 --> 03:21:52.32 is doing a yoga class.
03:21:52.32 --> 03:21:54.32 Someone else in order to work their strength
03:21:54.32 --> 03:21:56.56 is lifting some weights.
03:21:56.56 --> 03:21:59.36 I'm not saying, I'm not saying to go do all those things.
03:21:59.36 --> 03:22:01.20 But I'm saying you can get all three of them
03:22:01.20 --> 03:22:04.32 like a little hitter of all three of them.
03:22:04.32 --> 03:22:05.60 No problem.
03:22:05.60 --> 03:22:07.000 Get on the GJ2 bats.
03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:07.84 Yeah.
03:22:07.84 --> 03:22:09.44 Guy, nogie.
03:22:09.44 --> 03:22:10.68 Both of them.
03:22:10.68 --> 03:22:11.64 Yes.
03:22:11.64 --> 03:22:13.48 Well, yes.
03:22:13.48 --> 03:22:16.92 But if you're doing Guy only because someone
03:22:16.92 --> 03:22:19.68 on the street might be wearing certain types of clothes.
03:22:19.68 --> 03:22:23.76 Same exact point I just made.
03:22:23.76 --> 03:22:24.08 Yeah.
03:22:24.08 --> 03:22:27.84 If you're only going to do Guy because of that,
03:22:27.84 --> 03:22:28.68 it's worth it.
03:22:28.68 --> 03:22:30.04 But there's all these other beneficial things.
03:22:30.04 --> 03:22:31.04 Yes.
03:22:31.04 --> 03:22:32.08 And I'll tell you this right now.
03:22:32.08 --> 03:22:35.28 Really the number one thing that'll keep you in GJ2
03:22:35.28 --> 03:22:36.96 doing it, the number one thing.
03:22:36.96 --> 03:22:40.40 And it's maybe even by far for most people
03:22:40.40 --> 03:22:41.24 is that it's fun.
03:22:41.24 --> 03:22:42.08 I was gonna say fun.
03:22:42.08 --> 03:22:42.92 It's great.
03:22:42.92 --> 03:22:44.44 I hope we're aligned with this.
03:22:44.44 --> 03:22:45.28 To you.
03:22:45.28 --> 03:22:47.56 It's true because look, think about it.
03:22:47.56 --> 03:22:48.72 Oh yeah.
03:22:48.72 --> 03:22:50.80 I'm gonna do GJ2 for self defense.
03:22:50.80 --> 03:22:51.44 Oh yeah.
03:22:51.44 --> 03:22:52.28 That's the answer.
03:22:52.28 --> 03:22:56.84 When I started GJ2, me, when I started I was like,
03:22:56.84 --> 03:22:57.80 I'm just gonna do good enough.
03:22:57.80 --> 03:23:00.24 You know, so I can handle myself.
03:23:00.24 --> 03:23:02.28 Which is like I said about six months period.
03:23:02.28 --> 03:23:04.76 About six months, if you're an aggressive guy
03:23:04.76 --> 03:23:07.88 and you're a good athlete or strong or whatever,
03:23:07.88 --> 03:23:09.60 six months you're pretty good to go.
03:23:09.60 --> 03:23:10.44 Right?
03:23:10.44 --> 03:23:11.76 Six months of GJ2, you know what's up.
03:23:11.76 --> 03:23:13.72 It's been 20, whatever years.
03:23:13.72 --> 03:23:14.56 You know?
03:23:14.56 --> 03:23:15.72 Yeah, exactly.
03:23:15.72 --> 03:23:16.56 Right.
03:23:16.56 --> 03:23:20.40 So, oh yeah, don't, I mean, and if you tap someone out,
03:23:20.40 --> 03:23:22.88 try the first time, the first time you tap someone out.
03:23:22.88 --> 03:23:24.68 Then say like, oh yeah, that's the first time.
03:23:24.68 --> 03:23:26.68 Yeah, that's, I made that up, by the way.
03:23:26.68 --> 03:23:29.44 You're trying to impinge on my statement.
03:23:29.44 --> 03:23:32.44 Well, you might have made up saying that maybe bringing it
03:23:32.44 --> 03:23:35.08 to light, but the fact is true.
03:23:35.08 --> 03:23:39.92 So you're saying that I only quoted like a universal truth.
03:23:39.92 --> 03:23:41.76 Yeah, you know self-evident.
03:23:41.76 --> 03:23:45.000 I don't know man, because people used to ask how long
03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.36 should I train for?
03:23:46.36 --> 03:23:47.52 Or I had no.
03:23:47.52 --> 03:23:49.32 I mean, we got the question on the podcast.
03:23:49.32 --> 03:23:50.88 How long should I really don't like it?
03:23:50.88 --> 03:23:52.28 And the answer was, at first, like, well,
03:23:52.28 --> 03:23:53.60 you should try it for six months, oh, three months.
03:23:53.60 --> 03:23:54.72 Whatever, no, no, no.
03:23:54.72 --> 03:23:57.28 They train until you tap someone out.
03:23:57.28 --> 03:23:58.76 I don't want to use the term in anger,
03:23:58.76 --> 03:24:00.68 but you tap someone out for real,
03:24:00.68 --> 03:24:02.52 it is just you training environment.
03:24:02.52 --> 03:24:03.12 Yeah.
03:24:03.12 --> 03:24:03.76 And then you're good.
03:24:03.76 --> 03:24:04.60 Yeah, you're right.
03:24:04.60 --> 03:24:06.08 That was the specific answer.
03:24:06.08 --> 03:24:07.24 So yeah, that is yours.
03:24:07.24 --> 03:24:08.08 Okay.
03:24:08.08 --> 03:24:10.72 I'm just making sure, because I'm over here wanting full credit.
03:24:10.72 --> 03:24:12.60 That's not the last.
03:24:12.60 --> 03:24:13.84 If you're training, it just for us.
03:24:13.84 --> 03:24:17.36 If you were to set it in not such a way,
03:24:17.36 --> 03:24:20.20 like the way you set it, man, you thought you set it
03:24:20.20 --> 03:24:24.24 as if you just created like E equals NC squared over there.
03:24:24.24 --> 03:24:25.80 You like you should train until you,
03:24:25.80 --> 03:24:29.52 you were looking down your nose as you said it as if.
03:24:29.52 --> 03:24:31.24 So I had to call you out on that one.
03:24:31.24 --> 03:24:32.84 There my little bro's you go.
03:24:32.84 --> 03:24:33.68 Oh, good.
03:24:33.68 --> 03:24:35.20 I was just remembering the other day.
03:24:35.20 --> 03:24:37.96 Well, the Austrian guy that came came Kurt.
03:24:37.96 --> 03:24:38.52 Is his name?
03:24:38.52 --> 03:24:39.36 Kurt, yeah.
03:24:39.36 --> 03:24:40.20 Young Kurt.
03:24:40.20 --> 03:24:41.04 Yeah, so I asked him.
03:24:41.04 --> 03:24:42.32 I was like, Carl Longing been training.
03:24:42.32 --> 03:24:43.52 He said like a month or something.
03:24:43.52 --> 03:24:45.76 Like some kind of kind of new, really new.
03:24:45.76 --> 03:24:47.96 And so I said, have you tapped anyone out yet?
03:24:47.96 --> 03:24:48.96 And he said, yes.
03:24:48.96 --> 03:24:52.32 So like, all this guy's in the game, I knew her, Eddie.
03:24:52.32 --> 03:24:55.08 So maybe I kind of drew from that recent experience
03:24:55.08 --> 03:24:56.80 to, you know, to kind of say it.
03:24:56.80 --> 03:24:59.000 But in the last, like I was saying, if you train,
03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.56 only for self defense, only for self defense.
03:25:01.56 --> 03:25:03.88 Not because it's fun, not because it's a good workout,
03:25:03.88 --> 03:25:06.04 not because you got into a bunch of new friends,
03:25:06.04 --> 03:25:07.56 not because all this stuff.
03:25:08.76 --> 03:25:11.92 Only for self defense after a while, not even a long while
03:25:11.92 --> 03:25:14.24 after a short while, you can be like, I don't even know
03:25:14.24 --> 03:25:16.96 I'm doing it like, I'm not even, I'm not using it
03:25:16.96 --> 03:25:18.36 to defend myself really.
03:25:18.36 --> 03:25:20.56 Yeah, you know, because those are kind of rare, you know.
03:25:20.56 --> 03:25:22.24 And then you might not do it, you know, especially in the
03:25:22.24 --> 03:25:22.68 not fun.
03:25:22.68 --> 03:25:23.88 So there you go.
03:25:23.88 --> 03:25:26.000 And fun people, like there are people who
03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:29.48 train you just to for decades, literally decades that
03:25:29.48 --> 03:25:31.40 have never got in a fight before.
03:25:31.40 --> 03:25:33.84 Never got in a street fight, never got in it like a physical
03:25:33.84 --> 03:25:34.16 fight.
03:25:34.16 --> 03:25:36.36 So it's like, yeah, are they trained for self defense?
03:25:36.36 --> 03:25:37.04 Yeah, sure.
03:25:37.04 --> 03:25:37.88 Of course.
03:25:37.88 --> 03:25:38.88 But that's not why.
03:25:38.88 --> 03:25:39.40 Why?
03:25:39.40 --> 03:25:40.40 That's not why they're in the game.
03:25:40.40 --> 03:25:41.40 Yeah, exactly.
03:25:41.40 --> 03:25:44.04 So nonetheless, when we do it like I said, do the
03:25:44.04 --> 03:25:45.20 ghee, this can be one of it.
03:25:45.20 --> 03:25:46.52 The other part, it's no game.
03:25:46.52 --> 03:25:49.84 When you do get a ghee, you get an origin key.
03:25:49.84 --> 03:25:53.76 Yeah, 100% 100% best geese by far.
03:25:53.76 --> 03:25:54.92 So, factually.
03:25:54.92 --> 03:25:56.76 Now, same type of thing.
03:25:56.76 --> 03:26:00.36 If you're going to get an origin key, just because you
03:26:00.36 --> 03:26:01.92 want the best ghee, that's good.
03:26:01.92 --> 03:26:02.52 That's a good.
03:26:02.52 --> 03:26:03.52 That's our good reason.
03:26:03.52 --> 03:26:04.64 Like that's solid.
03:26:04.64 --> 03:26:05.32 Right?
03:26:05.32 --> 03:26:06.36 That's my reason.
03:26:06.36 --> 03:26:08.92 If you peel back the layer a little bit and you want to
03:26:08.92 --> 03:26:10.44 find out what else you're going to get, well, what
03:26:10.44 --> 03:26:12.84 else you're going to get, you're going to get the fact that
03:26:12.84 --> 03:26:17.40 you are literally rebuilding an industry and a
03:26:17.40 --> 03:26:23.20 community and an economy inside of America.
03:26:23.20 --> 03:26:26.36 You know, that's a little, that's not even a little bonus.
03:26:26.36 --> 03:26:28.44 Like there's some people that would look at that and say,
03:26:28.44 --> 03:26:30.60 I'm going to buy an origin key just because of that.
03:26:30.60 --> 03:26:31.60 Yeah.
03:26:31.60 --> 03:26:34.04 And then if I even do, you get to that sort of second
03:26:34.04 --> 03:26:35.04 thing.
03:26:35.04 --> 03:26:36.04 Yeah, I can do it.
03:26:36.04 --> 03:26:39.40 Now, if you're feeling it, let's say you're feeling it.
03:26:39.40 --> 03:26:41.04 You're feeling that part.
03:26:41.04 --> 03:26:44.92 You're feeling like America, you're feeling the economy,
03:26:44.92 --> 03:26:46.76 you're feeling the community, you're feeling the industry,
03:26:46.76 --> 03:26:48.52 you're going to bring it back, you're going to help.
03:26:48.52 --> 03:26:53.32 But you still haven't gotten over the hump of showing
03:26:53.32 --> 03:26:55.40 average of your kids to school.
03:26:55.40 --> 03:26:57.28 But you still want to support it.
03:26:57.28 --> 03:26:59.000 It's OK.
03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.60 It's, we'll say, I step in the right direction.
03:27:01.60 --> 03:27:04.64 We have genes that you can get.
03:27:04.64 --> 03:27:06.08 You can get genes.
03:27:06.08 --> 03:27:07.72 You're still going to help those other three.
03:27:07.72 --> 03:27:10.84 I would prefer the first thing that you get.
03:27:10.84 --> 03:27:14.04 In all seriousness, the first thing I would prefer you get
03:27:14.04 --> 03:27:16.84 is a geek because that tells me you're going to get on the map.
03:27:16.84 --> 03:27:19.20 If you, if you, because so many people,
03:27:19.20 --> 03:27:21.92 and you know what, every, well, you know what, 99% of people
03:27:21.92 --> 03:27:23.96 say when they finally start due to it,
03:27:23.96 --> 03:27:26.80 I wish I would have started, well, when I first
03:27:26.80 --> 03:27:29.40 this, blah, that's what people say.
03:27:29.40 --> 03:27:30.32 Tell you this.
03:27:30.32 --> 03:27:33.64 I'm meeting people now that are purple belts that started
03:27:33.64 --> 03:27:35.76 due to when they started listening to this podcast.
03:27:35.76 --> 03:27:39.16 So where about probably three to four years away
03:27:39.16 --> 03:27:40.44 from having somebody that started you
03:27:40.44 --> 03:27:45.000 to listen to this podcast will be a black belt in GJ2,
03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:46.76 which is an awesome achievement.
03:27:46.76 --> 03:27:48.80 Here's the thing.
03:27:48.80 --> 03:27:51.60 There's also people that will say I started listening
03:27:51.60 --> 03:27:54.12 to podcast in three years when I'm by before I started.
03:27:54.12 --> 03:27:56.28 You could have been a purple belt.
03:27:56.28 --> 03:27:56.96 Don't wait.
03:27:56.96 --> 03:27:58.44 I'm telling you right now.
03:27:58.44 --> 03:28:02.04 Like, I'm telling you right now, start your GJ2.
03:28:02.04 --> 03:28:04.48 In fact, I'm telling you that.
03:28:04.48 --> 03:28:09.16 And by the way, we touched on a little kind of combatives,
03:28:09.16 --> 03:28:10.64 hand-to-hand combat in this book.
03:28:10.64 --> 03:28:11.48 All right.
03:28:11.48 --> 03:28:16.68 And there's a whole line of a whole thread we can pull on that
03:28:16.68 --> 03:28:20.88 and we will at some point the British combatives program
03:28:20.88 --> 03:28:23.08 World War II, very cool.
03:28:23.08 --> 03:28:27.44 I've done a read a bunch about it and we'll dig into it here
03:28:27.44 --> 03:28:28.80 because it's pretty awesome.
03:28:28.80 --> 03:28:33.000 The way they were doing things, their concepts, et cetera.
03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:37.76 But if they were alive today, they'd be loaned
03:28:37.76 --> 03:28:40.000 the GJ2 all day.
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:41.000 Yeah.
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.48 And they'd be getting American geese even from England.
03:28:45.48 --> 03:28:46.48 They'd be like, you know what?
03:28:46.48 --> 03:28:48.24 Those GJs get to yank.
03:28:48.24 --> 03:28:49.68 Get yourself a yanky geese.
03:28:49.68 --> 03:28:50.20 Right?
03:28:50.20 --> 03:28:53.04 Because again, really the primary reason is because it's
03:28:53.04 --> 03:28:54.64 factually the best one.
03:28:54.64 --> 03:28:55.24 Yeah.
03:28:55.24 --> 03:28:58.60 Same thing for jeans where I would say,
03:28:58.60 --> 03:29:03.52 since I got my pair of origin jeans, which is like,
03:29:03.52 --> 03:29:05.48 oh, I'll go when you think about it when they came out.
03:29:05.48 --> 03:29:08.36 So while I go, I have not worn any other jeans ever.
03:29:08.36 --> 03:29:09.36 No.
03:29:09.36 --> 03:29:10.36 Yeah.
03:29:10.36 --> 03:29:11.96 Why would you, why would you do that?
03:29:11.96 --> 03:29:13.60 No, there's not even a reason to do that.
03:29:13.60 --> 03:29:13.96 There's not even a reason.
03:29:13.96 --> 03:29:14.96 I only have one pair too.
03:29:14.96 --> 03:29:19.88 Or I don't have three but, unless that's the only ones I wear.
03:29:19.88 --> 03:29:22.88 Also, they, we have other stuff here at origin.
03:29:22.88 --> 03:29:23.72 We do.
03:29:23.72 --> 03:29:26.28 So yeah, joggers, you know, more athletic wear,
03:29:26.28 --> 03:29:27.84 all kinds of good stuff.
03:29:27.84 --> 03:29:31.28 You go to originmain.com main like the state.
03:29:31.28 --> 03:29:34.72 Also supplements, keep yourself in the game.
03:29:34.72 --> 03:29:35.72 Yep.
03:29:35.72 --> 03:29:38.28 Propel yourself further down the path.
03:29:38.28 --> 03:29:39.12 Yep.
03:29:39.12 --> 03:29:39.96 As it were.
03:29:39.96 --> 03:29:40.80 Yep.
03:29:40.80 --> 03:29:41.96 Get yourself.
03:29:41.96 --> 03:29:43.76 Joint warfare and Krooile.
03:29:43.76 --> 03:29:45.16 Out of the gate.
03:29:45.16 --> 03:29:49.36 Once again, and I feel bad because I did this on social media.
03:29:49.36 --> 03:29:51.12 Where the guy was like, hey, what can I do to help?
03:29:51.12 --> 03:29:54.44 And I was like, I, I didn't want to be that guy.
03:29:54.44 --> 03:29:56.52 That was like, well, you know, here,
03:29:56.52 --> 03:29:57.76 try my supplement line.
03:29:57.76 --> 03:30:00.60 You know, I just don't, I just don't want to be that guy.
03:30:00.60 --> 03:30:01.60 And then later I felt bad.
03:30:01.60 --> 03:30:04.56 I was like, I should have just been straight up and said, hey, listen, man,
03:30:04.56 --> 03:30:05.56 do whatever you want to do.
03:30:05.56 --> 03:30:08.76 Get yourself some Krooile and join warfare immediately.
03:30:08.76 --> 03:30:09.76 Order that.
03:30:09.76 --> 03:30:10.76 Oh, what?
03:30:10.76 --> 03:30:13.16 You're 36 years old and you fail in sore and you're doing it.
03:30:13.16 --> 03:30:15.96 And you're at, I think I was literally asking me how my joints are.
03:30:15.96 --> 03:30:17.96 I didn't say it.
03:30:17.96 --> 03:30:19.28 Because I don't want to be that guy.
03:30:19.28 --> 03:30:20.28 Yeah.
03:30:20.28 --> 03:30:21.28 Right now I'm being that guy.
03:30:21.28 --> 03:30:22.28 You know what guy I'm being?
03:30:22.28 --> 03:30:24.08 The guy that's actually trying to help people.
03:30:24.08 --> 03:30:26.08 Because I didn't help that guy as much as I could have.
03:30:26.08 --> 03:30:28.64 I should have said, listen, do what I, you know, be consistent.
03:30:28.64 --> 03:30:30.64 Don't take big chunks of time off.
03:30:30.64 --> 03:30:33.20 Order a Krooile and oil.
03:30:33.20 --> 03:30:34.92 Join warfare right now.
03:30:34.92 --> 03:30:36.32 That's what you have to do.
03:30:36.32 --> 03:30:37.12 That's my recommendation.
03:30:37.12 --> 03:30:38.84 I feel bad for not doing that.
03:30:38.84 --> 03:30:41.20 I will try not to make that mistake again.
03:30:41.20 --> 03:30:43.20 No, I had the same experience.
03:30:43.20 --> 03:30:46.68 I went on with Pete and Brian hands in daylight.
03:30:46.68 --> 03:30:47.52 Okay.
03:30:47.52 --> 03:30:49.12 I did an episode with him recently.
03:30:49.12 --> 03:30:52.84 And he was, and Pete was saying, oh, yeah, you're like durable.
03:30:52.84 --> 03:30:54.12 Because I don't have like ailments.
03:30:54.12 --> 03:30:55.72 You know, Pete's jammed up his back.
03:30:55.72 --> 03:30:56.72 Yeah.
03:30:56.72 --> 03:30:59.36 This is like, you know, we're, I'm older than him actually.
03:30:59.36 --> 03:31:01.000 And he's like, oh, yeah, you're durable.
03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:06.24 You know, and I was like, yeah, I mean, because I never thought I was durable at all.
03:31:06.24 --> 03:31:09.000 Like, that's actually being hanged out with me.
03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:11.000 Yeah, exactly.
03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.36 But I was pretty fragile to be honest with you.
03:31:13.36 --> 03:31:14.36 It's fine.
03:31:14.36 --> 03:31:15.36 You guys might, because you know what Pete said to me?
03:31:15.36 --> 03:31:19.44 Like, when he was just out here, he was like, you're, he told me I was durable.
03:31:19.44 --> 03:31:20.44 Well, you're, you're.
03:31:20.44 --> 03:31:22.48 So I figured that you guys had that conversation.
03:31:22.48 --> 03:31:24.40 Because I said, that's what I call told me one time.
03:31:24.40 --> 03:31:25.68 Anyway, you told me, when you told me that,
03:31:25.68 --> 03:31:29.20 they've been like, it, when you told it to me, it had been like you had been contemplating
03:31:29.20 --> 03:31:31.000 it for quite some time.
03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:32.32 You were like, you know what I figured out about you?
03:31:32.32 --> 03:31:33.32 And I was like, what?
03:31:33.32 --> 03:31:34.32 And you said, you're durable.
03:31:34.32 --> 03:31:35.32 Yeah, like a tank.
03:31:35.32 --> 03:31:36.92 I was like, that's interesting.
03:31:36.92 --> 03:31:38.60 And I had to kind of agree with it.
03:31:38.60 --> 03:31:39.60 Yes.
03:31:39.60 --> 03:31:41.76 And so he said that I was durable.
03:31:41.76 --> 03:31:44.56 And I was like, well, and we even said, no, jocals durable.
03:31:44.56 --> 03:31:48.44 I don't, and then, but then, I guess on in a way, yeah, because you're, you're, you
03:31:48.44 --> 03:31:50.04 bounce back from some pretty solid.
03:31:50.04 --> 03:31:51.04 Pretty solid.
03:31:51.04 --> 03:31:53.24 You know, how many new surgeries you had?
03:31:53.24 --> 03:31:57.20 One knee surgery, but if you need injuries, plus my loose knees, I know.
03:31:57.20 --> 03:31:58.20 I know.
03:31:58.20 --> 03:31:59.20 I know.
03:31:59.20 --> 03:32:01.52 They're loose for real.
03:32:01.52 --> 03:32:03.88 Anyway, so they pop out all the time.
03:32:03.88 --> 03:32:06.88 That means what I'm saying, you know, and they'll get more and more squats.
03:32:06.88 --> 03:32:08.20 I'd decide to do the process.
03:32:08.20 --> 03:32:09.20 And how's this?
03:32:09.20 --> 03:32:10.20 I do do squats.
03:32:10.20 --> 03:32:14.000 And actually now, I go deep like all the way down like you.
03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:15.000 Yeah.
03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:16.000 Oh, yeah, that's the reason.
03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:17.000 And how's they feeling tighter?
03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:18.000 No, no.
03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:19.000 Great.
03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:20.000 I mean, same.
03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:21.000 No, they still pop out in jiu-jitsu.
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.36 Like when I do better, like, anyways, it doesn't matter.
03:32:22.36 --> 03:32:27.40 The loose, clinically, the doctor, orthopedic surgeon told me that.
03:32:27.40 --> 03:32:30.40 Anyway, so anyway, I don't feel like that.
03:32:30.40 --> 03:32:32.40 I don't feel like that.
03:32:32.40 --> 03:32:37.24 Anyway, given the circumstances, yeah, I guess I am pretty durable.
03:32:37.24 --> 03:32:39.48 But anyway, the point is we're talking about this stuff.
03:32:39.48 --> 03:32:43.60 And then, like, I'm like saying, like, oh, yeah, plus, I don't take time out of it.
03:32:43.60 --> 03:32:48.28 And then I'm naturally going into plus to take during more fair, or everyday, like, religiously,
03:32:48.28 --> 03:32:54.72 you know, so it's basically the point was to say you got to actively be durable, you know,
03:32:54.72 --> 03:32:55.72 kind of thing.
03:32:55.72 --> 03:32:56.72 Oh, yeah.
03:32:56.72 --> 03:32:58.88 But they're not like purely genetic apparently, right?
03:32:58.88 --> 03:33:00.28 Increase your durability.
03:33:00.28 --> 03:33:02.52 Also, we got other stuff.
03:33:02.52 --> 03:33:07.08 We got discipline go in a can, which is just awesome.
03:33:07.08 --> 03:33:08.08 It's awesome.
03:33:08.08 --> 03:33:10.44 No sugar.
03:33:10.44 --> 03:33:12.20 It tastes delicious.
03:33:12.20 --> 03:33:15.20 It has some caffeine in it.
03:33:15.20 --> 03:33:17.68 It has some, it's got some other things in it.
03:33:17.68 --> 03:33:20.04 But it's got a little kick that goes with it.
03:33:20.04 --> 03:33:23.48 Same with the discipline powder, which is what I drink pretty much all the time.
03:33:23.48 --> 03:33:27.000 It's almost, it doesn't have too much caffeine in the discipline powder.
03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:31.56 It's got like 15 milligrams, a scoop, which is not crazy at all.
03:33:31.56 --> 03:33:35.12 It's a micro dose, even if you have two scoops.
03:33:35.12 --> 03:33:36.12 What's that?
03:33:36.12 --> 03:33:37.92 30 million, you know, 45 million grams for three scoops.
03:33:37.92 --> 03:33:39.16 It's not that big of a deal.
03:33:39.16 --> 03:33:44.28 But taste delicious has some other ingredients that give you a little.
03:33:44.28 --> 03:33:48.88 Do you?
03:33:48.88 --> 03:33:51.96 Protein, the form of the dessert.
03:33:51.96 --> 03:33:57.12 For adults and kids, even though it's like sure the kids are going to drink the regular
03:33:57.12 --> 03:33:59.72 milk and let's face it.
03:33:59.72 --> 03:34:01.12 The adults are going to drink the word.
03:34:01.12 --> 03:34:02.12 Kid mobs.
03:34:02.12 --> 03:34:09.28 So much where your kid mock, I'm surprised I haven't turned gone down in age.
03:34:09.28 --> 03:34:12.36 The less those are there too.
03:34:12.36 --> 03:34:14.24 And they taste insane.
03:34:14.24 --> 03:34:15.24 That's the thing.
03:34:15.24 --> 03:34:17.52 So that's that.
03:34:17.52 --> 03:34:24.92 Also, Jocquay T. And by the way, right now, this all these supplements that you might

03:35:06.72 --> 03:35:09.24 I don't really use the word gear that much, but I'm going to use it.

03:35:52.52 --> 03:35:54.52 You know, just trying it out, I guess.
03:35:54.52 --> 03:35:55.52 You know, I can't even make it.
03:35:55.52 --> 03:35:56.52 Make sense.
03:35:56.52 --> 03:36:00.60 If you also want to leave a review, some people leave really good reviews.
03:36:00.60 --> 03:36:03.96 And by good reviews, I don't mean, hey, it's a great podcast.
03:36:03.96 --> 03:36:07.20 I probably like the insight that, no, I mean,
03:36:07.20 --> 03:36:10.76 reviews that are, let's just say there's, they've got layers.
03:36:10.76 --> 03:36:11.44 layers.
03:36:11.44 --> 03:36:12.40 Fun, colorful.
03:36:12.40 --> 03:36:14.96 Color, they make me laugh, they make me chuckle.
03:36:14.96 --> 03:36:15.96 I'm sure.
03:36:15.96 --> 03:36:17.96 Don't forget about the ground in vodka.
03:36:17.96 --> 03:36:24.48 So shines a good deed, you know, weary world.
03:36:24.48 --> 03:36:25.48 Yeah.
03:36:25.48 --> 03:36:27.48 Sorry, I don't know.
03:36:27.48 --> 03:36:32.64 I don't know what you have in scene, Willy Wonk and the chocolate factory lately.
03:36:32.64 --> 03:36:35.96 No, to be, I don't think of seeing no one in any of them.
03:36:35.96 --> 03:36:37.60 I saw part of the Johnny Depp one.
03:36:37.60 --> 03:36:39.08 No, I part of it.
03:36:39.08 --> 03:36:40.08 Fowl.
03:36:40.08 --> 03:36:41.08 Well, thank you.
03:36:41.08 --> 03:36:42.96 You got to watch the original one.
03:36:42.96 --> 03:36:43.96 It's awesome.
03:36:43.96 --> 03:36:44.60 It's a great movie.
03:36:44.60 --> 03:36:45.60 All right.
03:36:45.60 --> 03:36:47.36 Well, interesting.
03:36:47.36 --> 03:36:48.32 That's interesting.
03:36:48.32 --> 03:36:49.32 Jock, you heard it.
03:36:49.32 --> 03:36:50.32 Jocko.
03:36:50.32 --> 03:36:51.32 Watch that.
03:36:51.32 --> 03:36:53.76 We, Lee Wonkka and the chocolate factory isn't awesome.
03:36:53.76 --> 03:36:55.72 Yes, it is an awesome movie.
03:36:55.72 --> 03:36:56.72 Okay.
03:36:56.72 --> 03:36:58.72 Oh, go watch it.
03:36:58.72 --> 03:36:59.72 Amen.
03:36:59.72 --> 03:37:00.72 Maybe I'll look into it.
03:37:00.72 --> 03:37:02.20 Maybe he'll watch a report back.
03:37:02.20 --> 03:37:04.20 Less grounded podcast.
03:37:04.20 --> 03:37:07.40 I mean, I'm over here throwing out quotes from the movie, right?
03:37:07.40 --> 03:37:08.40 We're doing Shakespeare.
03:37:08.40 --> 03:37:12.08 We're doing, we're doing the memory endurance, but we're also throwing out some Willy
03:37:12.08 --> 03:37:13.08 Wonkka.
03:37:13.08 --> 03:37:15.44 Charlie and the chocolate factory.
03:37:15.44 --> 03:37:16.44 Sure.
03:37:16.44 --> 03:37:17.44 All right.
03:37:17.44 --> 03:37:18.44 Well, there you go.
03:37:18.44 --> 03:37:19.44 It will make sense.
03:37:19.44 --> 03:37:23.84 Anyway, like I'll say, I'm grounded podcast as a podcast about life.
03:37:23.84 --> 03:37:24.84 Jiu-Jitsu.
03:37:24.84 --> 03:37:25.84 Life.
03:37:25.84 --> 03:37:26.84 Life.
03:37:26.84 --> 03:37:29.96 Jiu-Jitsu is infused into life.
03:37:29.96 --> 03:37:31.68 Or is life infused into Jiu-Jitsu?
03:37:31.68 --> 03:37:32.68 Both.
03:37:32.68 --> 03:37:37.32 More important, I think life is reflective of Jiu-Jitsu and Jiu-Jitsu is reflective of life.
03:37:37.32 --> 03:37:42.08 So if you can learn from one, you will learn about both, which is important.
03:37:42.08 --> 03:37:43.08 It's true.
03:37:43.08 --> 03:37:46.44 Not quite as often as chocolate podcasts, but it's out there.
03:37:46.44 --> 03:37:49.72 So, which is weird, because it's like really hard to make this podcast.
03:37:49.72 --> 03:37:51.92 It's really easy to make a grounded one.
03:37:51.92 --> 03:37:52.92 But you know what we do?
03:37:52.92 --> 03:37:53.92 We do the hard things.
03:37:53.92 --> 03:37:54.92 Yes.
03:37:54.92 --> 03:37:55.92 That's what we focus on.
03:37:55.92 --> 03:37:56.92 Prioritize.
03:37:56.92 --> 03:37:57.92 Prioritize.
03:37:57.92 --> 03:37:59.92 And what is the second part?
03:37:59.92 --> 03:38:00.92 In the way.
03:38:00.92 --> 03:38:01.92 In the way.
03:38:01.92 --> 03:38:02.92 You know what's just got a knife in the drum, bro?
03:38:02.92 --> 03:38:09.12 Oh, so warrior kid podcast, which is a good one for the young trooper, warrior
03:38:09.12 --> 03:38:10.12 kids.
03:38:10.12 --> 03:38:14.36 And don't be shy if you're a parent to listen, because you're in a learn.
03:38:14.36 --> 03:38:17.32 I wish I would have that podcast as a parent when my kids were young.
03:38:17.32 --> 03:38:19.36 Actually, in a way, it's a parent podcast.
03:38:19.36 --> 03:38:20.36 It is.
03:38:20.36 --> 03:38:21.36 It is.
03:38:21.36 --> 03:38:22.36 It is.
03:38:22.36 --> 03:38:28.24 Yeah, because you know, like, when you hear of certain people's childhoods, for whatever.
03:38:28.24 --> 03:38:32.20 Like, certain like people who are like successful in XYZ, whether it be athletes, whatever,
03:38:32.20 --> 03:38:33.20 right?
03:38:33.20 --> 03:38:34.20 And you learn about their childhood.
03:38:34.20 --> 03:38:38.32 You could probably learn some solid stuff like, oh, I just just had one model.
03:38:38.32 --> 03:38:39.32 Yeah.
03:38:39.32 --> 03:38:40.92 Let me try to, you know, start incorporating it.
03:38:40.92 --> 03:38:41.92 Yeah.
03:38:41.92 --> 03:38:42.92 Yeah.
03:38:42.92 --> 03:38:43.92 So let's do the work.
03:38:43.92 --> 03:38:44.92 If I can say it's all in there.
03:38:44.92 --> 03:38:45.92 Yep.
03:38:45.92 --> 03:38:51.04 Speaking of warrior kids, don't forget about the warrior kid soap at IrishOxoranch.com.
03:38:51.04 --> 03:38:53.60 And actually right now live.
03:38:53.60 --> 03:38:57.36 Live is a new.
03:38:57.36 --> 03:38:58.36 Is it model?
03:38:58.36 --> 03:38:59.36 What's it called?
03:38:59.36 --> 03:39:00.36 A new model.
03:39:00.36 --> 03:39:02.36 It's not flavor because you don't eat it.
03:39:02.36 --> 03:39:03.36 It's a new.
03:39:03.36 --> 03:39:04.36 It's a new.
03:39:04.36 --> 03:39:07.36 I didn't even know.
03:39:07.36 --> 03:39:08.36 No, it's a new.
03:39:08.36 --> 03:39:09.36 Come on.
03:39:09.36 --> 03:39:10.36 I'm thinking of regular soap.
03:39:10.36 --> 03:39:12.36 So, you know, like, I don't know what do they say.
03:39:12.36 --> 03:39:13.36 It's a new version.
03:39:13.36 --> 03:39:14.36 Right.
03:39:14.36 --> 03:39:18.20 We have a new model, a new version of soap.
03:39:18.20 --> 03:39:22.000 You have actually have to check it out because it's so legit.
03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:24.36 It's called, well, what it does.
03:39:24.36 --> 03:39:27.32 Let me tell you how much it does is it's got some.
03:39:27.32 --> 03:39:28.32 Anti-microbial.
03:39:28.32 --> 03:39:29.32 Anti-microbial.
03:39:29.32 --> 03:39:31.32 I think it does.
03:39:31.32 --> 03:39:38.32 It's got some anti-fungal natural elements to it.
03:39:38.32 --> 03:39:41.76 One of those elements is like it's got like tea tree oil.
03:39:41.76 --> 03:39:44.72 It's got activated charcoal.
03:39:44.72 --> 03:39:45.72 And what's cool.
03:39:45.72 --> 03:39:46.72 So, this is what's cool.
03:39:46.72 --> 03:39:50.20 So, first of all, the soap is called killer soap.
03:39:50.20 --> 03:39:51.20 That's the name of the soap.
03:39:51.20 --> 03:39:57.000 But what, it couldn't be any more perfect because it is because of the charcoal.
03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.000 It's black.
03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:00.68 So, it's black.
03:40:00.68 --> 03:40:02.68 And it's awesome.
03:40:02.68 --> 03:40:05.64 So, get yourself some killer soap from IrishRokes Ranch.com.
03:40:05.64 --> 03:40:08.24 And by the way, this is a kid that's making it.
03:40:08.24 --> 03:40:11.56 A kid that started a company and pitched me.
03:40:11.56 --> 03:40:13.20 You know what stuff I get pitched?
03:40:13.20 --> 03:40:15.20 I get pitched up five times a day.
03:40:15.20 --> 03:40:17.60 I get pitched something, this, that, and the other.
03:40:17.60 --> 03:40:18.60 This kid pitched me.
03:40:18.60 --> 03:40:19.60 But, you know, he pitched me.
03:40:19.60 --> 03:40:21.64 He's like, hey, I'm already rolling.
03:40:21.64 --> 03:40:22.64 Yeah.
03:40:22.64 --> 03:40:23.92 You know, I'm already rolling.
03:40:23.92 --> 03:40:25.24 I'm already making soap.
03:40:25.24 --> 03:40:26.96 By the way, I'm 10.
03:40:26.96 --> 03:40:29.56 I've got a soap production line.
03:40:29.56 --> 03:40:31.28 And I've got vertical integration.
03:40:31.28 --> 03:40:33.56 I mean, he was getting after it.
03:40:33.56 --> 03:40:34.56 Yeah.
03:40:34.56 --> 03:40:36.80 So, he hasn't even pitched me.
03:40:36.80 --> 03:40:38.80 Pitched me.
03:40:38.80 --> 03:40:42.000 And of course, he didn't even pitch me by, could you, I know, he was like, I want you to know
03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:43.80 what I'm doing.
03:40:43.80 --> 03:40:46.20 There are openings if you would like to get a piece.
03:40:46.20 --> 03:40:47.20 Yeah.

03:40:54.32 --> 03:40:55.32 samples.
03:40:55.32 --> 03:40:56.32 What do you like?
03:40:56.32 --> 03:41:01.76 So, anyways, we went deep to cover the grappling and just the luck.

03:41:04.64 --> 03:41:10.48 And if you want to, you can get some killer soap, and that will help you as a person

03:42:22.92 --> 03:42:25.12 Also, don't forget about psychological warfare.
03:42:25.12 --> 03:42:29.36 Little psychological hitter.
03:42:29.36 --> 03:42:32.16 And I actually had the person point out to me.
03:42:32.16 --> 03:42:34.36 Hey, that was me.
03:42:34.36 --> 03:42:35.36 Now, so that's one.
03:42:35.36 --> 03:42:39.08 I also had the person point out to me that there was a name for the type of shooting that
03:42:39.08 --> 03:42:41.60 we talked about, which is where you're shooting at where things are.
03:42:41.60 --> 03:42:42.60 You think things might be.
03:42:42.60 --> 03:42:44.04 It's called Drake shooting.
03:42:44.04 --> 03:42:49.32 And the dude is like a he's a guy that's on Twitter who always brings up good
03:42:49.32 --> 03:42:50.32 points.
03:42:50.32 --> 03:42:52.44 He does his own personal research on stuff.
03:42:52.44 --> 03:42:57.96 But he's got a weird handle that I can't remember what it is ever.
03:42:57.96 --> 03:42:59.44 I recognize it in the heartbeat.
03:42:59.44 --> 03:43:02.04 I know I can tell you all the kind of things.
03:43:02.04 --> 03:43:05.12 So anyways, I apologize for not telling you that Drake shooting appreciate the info.
03:43:05.12 --> 03:43:07.000 He's always got a good info.
03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:10.52 But the psychological hitter with someone that's realized that that's what psychological
03:43:10.52 --> 03:43:11.52 warfare is.
03:43:11.52 --> 03:43:17.08 It's not some broad course on how to have more discipline in your life.
03:43:17.08 --> 03:43:21.96 It's just a little bit of a hitter in case you need it.
03:43:21.96 --> 03:43:28.72 So the psychological warfare, and if you need a visual hitter, you can go to flipsidecampus.com
03:43:28.72 --> 03:43:32.20 to go to my or make it a bunch of really cool.

03:44:24.84 --> 03:44:26.64 I'm biased.
03:44:26.64 --> 03:44:29.80 But I'm only biased because I read them.
03:44:29.80 --> 03:44:33.48 And I think, man, the lessons in these books.
03:44:33.48 --> 03:44:35.20 I wish I knew them.
03:44:35.20 --> 03:44:36.40 I wish I knew them.
03:44:36.40 --> 03:44:39.96 So warrior kid books one, two and three, way the warrior kid marks mission.
03:44:39.96 --> 03:44:44.48 And where there's a will, Mikey in the dragons, if you got a little or kid.
03:44:44.48 --> 03:44:47.84 Want to learn one of the most important things that you can learn as a kid is how to overcome
03:44:47.84 --> 03:44:50.88 fear that book shows you how to overcome fear.
03:44:50.88 --> 03:44:57.36 Discounted groups freedom, field manual, get it so that you can read two pages.
03:44:57.36 --> 03:44:58.36 Read two pages.
03:44:58.36 --> 03:45:03.28 Okay, you know, let's say we made up a pill that you could take this pill and you would
03:45:03.28 --> 03:45:05.08 get a mind shift.
03:45:05.08 --> 03:45:07.28 Like a positive way.
03:45:07.28 --> 03:45:08.56 Like you would.
03:45:08.56 --> 03:45:11.16 If you took this pill, you would increase your discipline.
03:45:11.16 --> 03:45:15.44 And factually, okay, would that pill pill sell well?
03:45:15.44 --> 03:45:16.44 Would people want it?
03:45:16.44 --> 03:45:17.44 Yes.
03:45:17.44 --> 03:45:18.44 Okay.
03:45:18.44 --> 03:45:19.44 Read two pages of this book.
03:45:19.44 --> 03:45:22.68 You're discipline will increase.
03:45:22.68 --> 03:45:24.96 16 to 18% by the way.
03:45:24.96 --> 03:45:25.96 Yeah.
03:45:25.96 --> 03:45:26.96 Increase in discipline.
03:45:26.96 --> 03:45:29.04 Well, read two pages.
03:45:29.04 --> 03:45:36.20 Well, in the defense of the pill people, pill advocates, the whole purpose of a pill is
03:45:36.20 --> 03:45:39.48 so you don't have to do any kind of work or read or do all this stuff.
03:45:39.48 --> 03:45:43.52 Okay, so okay.
03:45:43.52 --> 03:45:46.96 Two pages of this book is not an extended period of time.
03:45:46.96 --> 03:45:49.20 You're finishing this in less than four minutes.
03:45:49.20 --> 03:45:50.20 Oh, so right.
03:45:50.20 --> 03:45:53.76 So this book essentially is the pill of books.
03:45:53.76 --> 03:45:58.80 So you know, instead of like the encyclopedia set of books.
03:45:58.80 --> 03:45:59.80 Okay.
03:45:59.80 --> 03:46:00.80 We'll take it.
03:46:00.80 --> 03:46:02.80 It's a rough lose analogy.
03:46:02.80 --> 03:46:03.80 Not sure.
03:46:03.80 --> 03:46:05.60 Not 100% I'll think of something.
03:46:05.60 --> 03:46:06.60 Thank you through that one.
03:46:06.60 --> 03:46:08.88 And then of course, we got extreme ownership of the Nicodemy leadership.
03:46:08.88 --> 03:46:13.68 These are the foundational books about leadership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
03:46:13.68 --> 03:46:16.56 We got echelon front, which is a leadership consultancy.
03:46:16.56 --> 03:46:20.80 Look, if you have a business, if you have a team, if you have a company and you have
03:46:20.80 --> 03:46:24.72 problems, every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.
03:46:24.72 --> 03:46:29.84 I guarantee that every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.
03:46:29.84 --> 03:46:34.64 And what we do at echelon front is we solve problems through leadership.
03:46:34.64 --> 03:46:37.08 So go to echelonfront.com for details.
03:46:37.08 --> 03:46:44.16 We got EF online, which is leadership, interactive leadership training online, it's EF online.com.
03:46:44.16 --> 03:46:46.12 You can get the information.
03:46:46.12 --> 03:46:48.000 You can get the repetitions.
03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:54.44 You can get put in scenarios that will help you think through problems at EF online.
03:46:54.44 --> 03:47:00.52 We also do little live webinars where we answer questions.
03:47:00.52 --> 03:47:01.92 EF online.com.
03:47:01.92 --> 03:47:12.80 We got the mustard coming up in Dallas, Texas, Orlando, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona.
03:47:12.80 --> 03:47:15.60 Every event that we've done has sold out.
03:47:15.60 --> 03:47:21.72 If you want to come, go to extremownership.com right now and register leadership 7R.
03:47:21.72 --> 03:47:22.72 That's what we do there.
03:47:22.72 --> 03:47:29.60 And of course, we've got EF Overwatch and EF Legion placement for military people that
03:47:29.60 --> 03:47:32.60 understand extremownership.
03:47:32.60 --> 03:47:34.36 Then understand the dichotomy of leadership.
03:47:34.36 --> 03:47:36.80 EF Overwatch is for executive leadership inside companies.
03:47:36.80 --> 03:47:40.40 EF Legion front line troops and front line leaders.
03:47:40.40 --> 03:47:46.08 Go to EF Overwatch.com or EF Legion to get involved in that from either side, whether
03:47:46.08 --> 03:47:47.08 you're a vet.
03:47:47.08 --> 03:47:52.16 That wants to get into a civilian job or either civilian company that needs veterans to help
03:47:52.16 --> 03:47:53.72 you lead and win.
03:47:53.72 --> 03:47:56.24 Go to those websites and get that figured out.
03:47:56.24 --> 03:48:03.92 EF, if you have not heard enough of my overly dramatic speech patterns and excessively long
03:48:03.92 --> 03:48:06.56 pauses.
03:48:06.56 --> 03:48:13.28 And you haven't heard enough of ECHOS ridiculous commentary about the heroic life of being
03:48:13.28 --> 03:48:15.44 a balancer.
03:48:15.44 --> 03:48:22.16 Then we are available on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on the old Fission
03:48:22.16 --> 03:48:29.16 Blah, echo is that.
03:48:29.16 --> 03:48:31.36 ECHOS and I am at Jock on the link in.
03:48:31.36 --> 03:48:36.24 Thank you all for listening to the podcast and for giving this podcast to your support.
03:48:36.24 --> 03:48:38.24 Thanks for spreading the word.
03:48:38.24 --> 03:48:39.24 Thanks for telling your friends.
03:48:39.24 --> 03:48:44.60 Thanks for getting some deaf core gear or some origin gear, all of which allows us to
03:48:44.60 --> 03:48:46.24 do this podcast.
03:48:46.24 --> 03:48:58.20 And of course, thanks to Reg Curtis for your service and sacrifice to keep us free.
03:48:58.20 --> 03:49:02.12 And all the military members out there in uniform right now doing the same thing, keeping
03:49:02.12 --> 03:49:07.92 the enemy at bay, and also to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics
03:49:07.92 --> 03:49:11.60 and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers in Board of Patrol and Secret Service.
03:49:11.60 --> 03:49:15.60 And all first responders.
03:49:15.60 --> 03:49:17.04 Thank you for keeping us safe.
03:49:17.04 --> 03:49:27.12 Every single day here at home and everyone else out there, remember what Reg Curtis taught
03:49:27.12 --> 03:49:37.20 us to never give up even against overwhelming odds to never accept the feet to persevere
03:49:37.20 --> 03:49:42.28 and endure until the end.
03:49:42.28 --> 03:49:49.92 And then when you get tripped up or you get knocked down even then what you do is you do
03:49:49.92 --> 03:49:55.52 the best you can.
03:49:55.52 --> 03:49:58.68 Lesson learned.
03:49:58.68 --> 03:49:59.68 Thank you.
03:49:59.68 --> 03:50:08.88 Reg Curtis and we will be out there in your honor, getting after it.
03:50:08.88 --> 03:50:12.20 And until next time, the ZECO.
03:50:12.20 --> 03:50:14.20 And Jocco.
03:50:14.20 --> 03:50:30.68 Ouch.
