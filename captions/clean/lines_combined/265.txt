00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.68 This is Jockel podcast number 265 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:05.68 --> 00:00:06.68 Good evening, Echo.
00:00:06.68 --> 00:00:07.68 Good evening.
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:10.32 And also joining us tonight is Dave Burk, Good evening, Dave.
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:11.32 Good evening.
00:00:11.32 --> 00:00:15.28 So last podcast, we introduced Marine Corps,
00:00:15.28 --> 00:00:17.92 Doctional Publication at One Tack for, which is called,
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:19.72 Competing.
00:00:19.72 --> 00:00:22.24 And of course, we only made it one chapter deep because,
00:00:22.24 --> 00:00:24.80 well, there's a lot to go into.
00:00:24.80 --> 00:00:27.72 And so we're going to continue on.
00:00:27.72 --> 00:00:31.000 But first, we're going to take a little tangential trip
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.20 into my head a little bit.
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:37.56 So in reading that manual and as I talked about this,
00:00:37.56 --> 00:00:42.36 I started correlating competing with influencing.
00:00:42.36 --> 00:00:44.64 And you take that one step further, which isn't very,
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:46.56 a very big step.
00:00:46.56 --> 00:00:47.40 What is influencing?
00:00:47.40 --> 00:00:48.52 Influencing is leading.
00:00:48.52 --> 00:00:50.32 That's what you're doing.
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:55.24 So one of the main things that I liked about this Marine
00:00:55.24 --> 00:00:57.40 Corps concept of competing was this idea
00:00:57.40 --> 00:01:00.96 of this continuum of competition that they present in this book.
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:06.84 That goes from pure peace on one side, just pure peace.
00:01:06.84 --> 00:01:08.28 And then it starts to move to the right.
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:12.84 It goes to economic competition in then classic diplomacy
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:14.000 and then political warfare.
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.76 And then there's this gray zone and you get into hybrid war.
00:01:17.76 --> 00:01:19.52 And then you get into the threat of violence.
00:01:19.52 --> 00:01:22.12 And then you finally cross the,
00:01:22.12 --> 00:01:24.44 what they call the violence threshold.
00:01:24.44 --> 00:01:28.36 And then to, so you're now you're using violence.
00:01:28.36 --> 00:01:36.36 And then even violence has a place that expands on this continuum.
00:01:36.36 --> 00:01:40.40 It goes to from conventional war and then it keeps going further
00:01:40.40 --> 00:01:42.20 and further to the right to you get to total war,
00:01:42.20 --> 00:01:45.36 where one side is using any in all means.
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:47.84 And that's certainly completely destroyed there.
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:49.24 I mean.
00:01:49.24 --> 00:01:54.24 And so with that, I started thinking about
00:01:54.24 --> 00:01:59.24 the continuum of influence or the continuum of leadership
00:02:01.92 --> 00:02:06.48 that we have to use every day to lead an influence people.
00:02:06.48 --> 00:02:10.48 And it draws some very interesting parallels
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:14.72 to the continuum of competition at the Marine Corps
00:02:14.72 --> 00:02:18.16 talks about and there's one specific mark in there
00:02:18.16 --> 00:02:21.32 that really showed a lot of similarities to me.
00:02:21.32 --> 00:02:24.32 So if we look at this continuum from the beginning,
00:02:26.36 --> 00:02:30.48 like on the far side, you have someone that you don't care about.
00:02:30.48 --> 00:02:32.28 You don't care what they're doing.
00:02:32.28 --> 00:02:33.92 You're not trying to influence them.
00:02:33.92 --> 00:02:35.56 You don't want them to do anything at all.
00:02:35.56 --> 00:02:36.40 You just don't care.
00:02:36.40 --> 00:02:38.28 They're off their like, off the spectrum.
00:02:38.28 --> 00:02:40.44 I guess they're touching it, but they're not on it yet.
00:02:40.44 --> 00:02:41.92 So we don't have to worry about them.
00:02:41.92 --> 00:02:44.44 We don't care what they're doing at all.
00:02:44.44 --> 00:02:48.32 Now, as soon as you cross that first little threshold
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:53.32 and now you've got someone that you want to influence.
00:02:53.52 --> 00:02:56.68 You want them to follow a plan or you want them to execute an action
00:02:56.68 --> 00:02:59.000 or you want them to execute a behavior.
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.28 So now we're on to the continuum of influence
00:03:01.28 --> 00:03:03.88 or the continuum of leadership.
00:03:03.88 --> 00:03:05.32 So what does it start with?
00:03:06.52 --> 00:03:08.12 Well, it starts with we're trying to build a relationship
00:03:08.12 --> 00:03:08.96 with that person.
00:03:08.96 --> 00:03:09.96 That's where we're going to begin.
00:03:09.96 --> 00:03:11.16 And what's interesting, what's the best way
00:03:11.16 --> 00:03:12.64 to start building a relationship with someone?
00:03:12.64 --> 00:03:14.96 You let them start to influence you.
00:03:14.96 --> 00:03:16.80 So as soon as you're saying, hey, that's a good,
00:03:16.80 --> 00:03:18.28 I like that, I like what you're doing.
00:03:18.28 --> 00:03:20.000 And you're there's that.
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.88 You've heard of this thing mirroring.
00:03:21.88 --> 00:03:23.16 Have you heard this?
00:03:23.16 --> 00:03:25.04 So mirroring is the physical.
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:26.92 Oh, if Dave's hit the sitin with his hand
00:03:26.92 --> 00:03:29.84 on his cheek, then I do the same thing.
00:03:29.84 --> 00:03:31.64 And it's a little indicator.
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:33.76 I'm allowing you to see that you're kind of influencing
00:03:33.76 --> 00:03:34.80 me and it's a positive thing.
00:03:34.80 --> 00:03:37.24 So that's the base thing right there.
00:03:37.24 --> 00:03:41.36 A physical, actual mimicry of what you're doing, mirroring
00:03:41.36 --> 00:03:42.20 what you're doing.
00:03:42.20 --> 00:03:43.20 And that's my first way of showing you that.
00:03:43.20 --> 00:03:44.20 I'm allowing you a little influence.
00:03:44.20 --> 00:03:48.96 So now that's starting to build a good rapport between us.
00:03:48.96 --> 00:03:52.32 So that's like the lowest level.
00:03:52.32 --> 00:03:53.32 And then what am I going to do?
00:03:53.32 --> 00:03:54.44 I'm going to listen what you have to say.
00:03:54.44 --> 00:03:56.08 And so I'm starting to build this relationship
00:03:56.08 --> 00:03:57.48 and people don't think this way.
00:03:57.48 --> 00:03:58.72 People miss this, right?
00:03:58.72 --> 00:04:00.68 People don't understand that when I mirror you
00:04:00.68 --> 00:04:01.88 and when I listen to you, I'm actually
00:04:01.88 --> 00:04:02.84 starting to gain influence.
00:04:02.84 --> 00:04:04.52 People totally miss that all the time.
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:06.32 They completely miss that.
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:07.80 But that's level one, right?
00:04:07.80 --> 00:04:10.32 It's incredibly important level.
00:04:10.32 --> 00:04:15.16 But it's level whatever point zero zero eight or whatever
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:17.52 that numbers.
00:04:17.52 --> 00:04:18.84 So we're just listening.
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:21.84 We're letting them model where we're mirroring their behavior
00:04:21.84 --> 00:04:22.68 a little bit.
00:04:22.68 --> 00:04:27.000 Eventually as we start to escalate, we start to model
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.32 our behavior for them a little bit.
00:04:29.32 --> 00:04:30.48 But we start acting a certain way.
00:04:30.48 --> 00:04:31.64 We're not asking you to do it.
00:04:31.64 --> 00:04:33.56 We're just doing it.
00:04:33.56 --> 00:04:37.48 And we're hoping that that influence
00:04:37.48 --> 00:04:43.04 rubs off on the other person and now they start to do the
00:04:43.04 --> 00:04:44.24 same thing.
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:47.08 And this is another thing that you can do.
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:49.48 You do it subconsciously, maybe do it consciously.
00:04:49.48 --> 00:04:55.72 But people are in a line at a grocery store.
00:04:55.72 --> 00:04:58.68 And a new line opens up.
00:04:58.68 --> 00:05:01.72 And if no one sees it, if you just,
00:05:01.72 --> 00:05:03.60 if no one sees it, you can just walk over to that line
00:05:03.60 --> 00:05:05.68 and then people see it and they kind of model your behavior
00:05:05.68 --> 00:05:06.32 and you're kind of influenced
00:05:06.32 --> 00:05:07.84 like a bunch of people that you don't even know.
00:05:07.84 --> 00:05:11.96 But it's just a way of modeling behavior
00:05:11.96 --> 00:05:13.56 and setting this over here all the time, right?
00:05:13.56 --> 00:05:14.56 Set the example.
00:05:14.56 --> 00:05:15.40 Set a good example.
00:05:15.40 --> 00:05:16.16 That's a good way to lead.
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:18.20 For sure, that's outstanding.
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:24.44 Eventually though, maybe that's not enough, right?
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:30.72 Maybe we're trying to influence someone to do something,
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:38.72 either follow a plan, adjust their behavior, take a certain action.
00:05:38.72 --> 00:05:40.12 If we're trying to get someone to do that,
00:05:40.12 --> 00:05:42.32 and they haven't really followed our modeling,
00:05:42.32 --> 00:05:45.60 now we got to start escalating and going a little bit harder.
00:05:45.60 --> 00:05:46.68 So that's a little bit harder.
00:05:46.68 --> 00:05:50.80 Well, asking good questions, asking earnest questions.
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:52.68 Oh, hey, hey, Dave, why do you do this like that?
00:05:52.68 --> 00:05:54.08 And it's just a way.
00:05:54.08 --> 00:05:57.32 And then listen so that as Dave explains to me
00:05:57.32 --> 00:05:58.80 why he's doing something a certain way,
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:01.60 maybe it reveals to him, because now he's looking at it
00:06:01.60 --> 00:06:03.000 from a detached perspective.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.32 That's an amazing thing about asking someone a question.
00:06:05.32 --> 00:06:06.80 When you ask someone a question,
00:06:06.80 --> 00:06:10.20 it detaches them from what they're doing.
00:06:10.20 --> 00:06:12.04 That's what makes it such a powerful tool.
00:06:12.04 --> 00:06:14.000 Because when Dave is just sitting there with his pen
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.20 and he's fiddling with his pen,
00:06:15.20 --> 00:06:16.52 he's not even noticing that he's doing it,
00:06:16.52 --> 00:06:17.92 which he's literally doing right now.
00:06:17.92 --> 00:06:20.04 But as soon as I say, hey, if I didn't want him to do that,
00:06:20.04 --> 00:06:21.92 if it was blurring the camera or something,
00:06:21.92 --> 00:06:25.000 hey, why are you, why you keep fiddling with that pen?
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.76 He has to detach to actually figure out why he's doing it.
00:06:28.76 --> 00:06:30.44 Which is a great thing,
00:06:30.44 --> 00:06:32.12 because we always want people to detach
00:06:32.12 --> 00:06:34.24 and see things from the outside.
00:06:34.24 --> 00:06:37.88 So just asking an earnest question is a really good
00:06:37.88 --> 00:06:41.08 escalation on this continuum that we're going through.
00:06:44.36 --> 00:06:49.48 Now, that little question and answer session that we're having
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:51.64 kind of leads to a discussion where we're actually
00:06:51.64 --> 00:06:52.92 having a discussion, well, you know,
00:06:52.92 --> 00:06:54.20 sometimes I just like to fidget.
00:06:54.20 --> 00:06:55.68 It makes me think, oh, that's interesting.
00:06:55.68 --> 00:06:58.48 So we can have a, we can have an actual conversation.
00:06:58.48 --> 00:07:00.24 And that whole discussion that we're having,
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:04.24 if I'm utilizing this correctly,
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:08.64 I'm guiding you, I'm guiding Dave, in this case,
00:07:08.64 --> 00:07:13.60 I'm guiding Dave to discover what I'm trying,
00:07:13.60 --> 00:07:15.20 I want you to discover the fact that, hey,
00:07:15.20 --> 00:07:16.40 if you're fidgeting with that pen,
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:18.32 people aren't even paying attention to what you're saying
00:07:18.32 --> 00:07:20.08 and it's making noise on camera and it's like,
00:07:20.08 --> 00:07:21.84 I want you to discover those things.
00:07:21.84 --> 00:07:23.12 And I want you to actually tell me about them,
00:07:23.12 --> 00:07:24.08 because then it comes from you,
00:07:24.08 --> 00:07:29.20 and that's infinitely more powerful.
00:07:29.20 --> 00:07:32.08 So, but sometimes it doesn't work.
00:07:32.08 --> 00:07:33.68 And sometimes even though someone detaches,
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:36.40 they just don't, they can't get far enough away from that thing.
00:07:36.40 --> 00:07:37.52 So where does it go from there?
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:40.72 Well, now I'm going to maybe offer an indirect,
00:07:40.72 --> 00:07:43.76 little statement about what's going on.
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:46.24 You know, just a little, you know,
00:07:46.24 --> 00:07:49.92 do you think it's distracting when you do that?
00:07:49.92 --> 00:07:51.52 With someone's watching you?
00:07:51.52 --> 00:07:55.52 I've always found that distracting,
00:07:55.52 --> 00:07:57.76 if someone's talking to me, but they're fidgeting.
00:07:57.76 --> 00:08:00.08 So now I'm just, I'm going to little, it's indirect,
00:08:00.08 --> 00:08:03.04 but it still is, I'm starting to put a little bit more pressure
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:04.000 with that statement, and of course,
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.64 now what I'm going to do, and we'll listen what you have to say.
00:08:07.84 --> 00:08:09.60 And so where does it escalate from there?
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:12.08 Now Dave's still not paying attention to what I'm saying.
00:08:12.08 --> 00:08:14.000 He's still just sitting there fidgeting with the pen,
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.08 and it's distracting to everyone, it's making noise,
00:08:16.08 --> 00:08:19.52 and it's messing up the focus, the camera's all kinds of problems.
00:08:19.52 --> 00:08:22.64 But Dave doesn't care, or whatever, he hasn't seen it yet.
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:27.36 So then maybe we escalate a little bit more,
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:31.36 and now, you know, it's my metaphors about to lose a little bit of traction,
00:08:31.36 --> 00:08:36.16 because that's such a minor thing that this next step,
00:08:37.92 --> 00:08:39.92 well, to say, hey, why don't we make a pro,
00:08:39.92 --> 00:08:43.44 like a pro and con list about fidgeting your pen, right?
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:46.08 Now if we were talking about, you know,
00:08:46.08 --> 00:08:48.16 going into a new market area with a business,
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:50.08 and you were like, hey, we're going, we're going, we're going,
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:51.68 we're going in, I had tried to influence you,
00:08:51.68 --> 00:08:52.80 and I tried to ask you questions about it,
00:08:52.80 --> 00:08:54.000 and I couldn't get you there.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.92 Then my next escalation might be,
00:08:55.92 --> 00:08:58.56 hey, why don't we do a pros and cons on that?
00:08:58.56 --> 00:09:00.32 I'm still not coming at you.
00:09:00.32 --> 00:09:04.48 I'm just asking, asking, like, hey, why don't we do some pros and cons?
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:05.92 That way, once again, what am I doing?
00:09:05.92 --> 00:09:07.68 You're going to have to detach you a pros and cons,
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:09.84 this is one of the benefits of doing a pros and cons list.
00:09:09.84 --> 00:09:12.96 Is it detaches you, takes some of those emotions away,
00:09:12.96 --> 00:09:17.28 and now we're sitting here saying, okay, Dave is detached to say,
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:19.92 well, these are some positive things, it helps me think,
00:09:19.92 --> 00:09:22.32 it gives me something to do with my hands,
00:09:22.32 --> 00:09:23.52 or let's go to the market area.
00:09:23.52 --> 00:09:25.36 Hey, here's the positive things about the market area.
00:09:25.36 --> 00:09:27.68 We don't have any stores there.
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:29.76 There seems to be a decent market, here's the cons,
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:31.76 it's going to, that's high rents in that area, whatever.
00:09:31.76 --> 00:09:36.16 So now you can start to reveal, you reveal,
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:39.44 instead of me revealing you, hey, man, the rents over there are ridiculous.
00:09:39.44 --> 00:09:42.64 Instead of me revealing that to you, which offends you?
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:45.84 In general, it offends people to just tell them anything.
00:09:45.84 --> 00:09:48.56 It's much better when you tell me, now all of a sudden it's your idea,
00:09:48.56 --> 00:09:50.56 and this is a beautiful thing.
00:09:51.60 --> 00:09:53.28 So that's like sort of the next thing.
00:09:53.28 --> 00:09:56.80 It's sort of another little level of escalation that you could do on this continual.
00:09:57.76 --> 00:10:02.24 Where I'm moving in that direction, I'm still trying to indirectly influence you.
00:10:04.40 --> 00:10:09.36 And maybe the next thing I do is offer some kind of a bargain,
00:10:09.36 --> 00:10:13.52 some kind of a negotiation, where I say, hey, you know,
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:17.68 maybe now is not the right time to go in that market, or maybe we look at it next quarter.
00:10:17.68 --> 00:10:24.56 Right, so it's a little negotiation to try and see if, if I can get you to think a little bit more about it.
00:10:24.56 --> 00:10:25.76 It's just an negotiation.
00:10:28.16 --> 00:10:31.44 And look, maybe you go, yeah, yeah, because maybe you saw just enough,
00:10:31.44 --> 00:10:34.16 maybe you saw, maybe it just revealed just enough of the problems that you're going,
00:10:34.16 --> 00:10:36.80 you know, maybe we do, you know, do this.
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:38.80 Maybe we may move away with the next quarter.
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:39.52 Yeah, we can do that.
00:10:40.56 --> 00:10:42.64 And there's another little technique that's going on there too,
00:10:42.64 --> 00:10:44.72 which is I'm giving you now, right?
00:10:44.72 --> 00:10:46.64 Yeah, well, wait, next. Yeah, that's probably a good idea, right?
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:50.64 So you are sort of, you start to see some of those issues, but you don't want to
00:10:50.64 --> 00:10:53.52 concede that your idea was not good.
00:10:53.52 --> 00:10:57.52 So instead, you just concede that it will just push it off a little bit, but it's still a good idea.
00:10:57.52 --> 00:11:00.24 So that way your ego remains intact and it's all good.
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:02.88 But maybe you didn't catch that.
00:11:04.80 --> 00:11:07.12 So now we're going to start to brush up against,
00:11:07.12 --> 00:11:11.60 we're starting to brush up against me being just direct with you,
00:11:13.60 --> 00:11:18.64 which is revealing some shortfalls, like just saying to you, hey, you know,
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:25.20 the rents in that area are really high and by the way, two similar businesses went into that market
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:28.64 and both of them washed out and that happened in the last 18 months.
00:11:29.68 --> 00:11:30.96 Those are real concerns.
00:11:33.04 --> 00:11:35.76 And even when I do that, so now I'm showing you, like,
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:37.68 those are no longer things that you revealed.
00:11:37.68 --> 00:11:39.36 Those are now things that I'm telling you.
00:11:39.36 --> 00:11:46.72 So this is a transition and, and I'm sure you're tracking this, but this whole thing is
00:11:46.72 --> 00:11:48.72 interlaced with leadership capital.
00:11:48.72 --> 00:11:53.76 This whole thing is interlaced. So the other ones, when you, when I allow you to
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:57.68 reveal something to me, my leadership capital goes up, when I tell you something, my leadership
00:11:57.68 --> 00:12:03.28 capital takes a little, takes a little bit of it, not, not thing crazy, but we're not neutral,
00:12:03.28 --> 00:12:07.36 right, some of those in the middle might be neutral. So I'm still going to give you an out,
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:10.000 you know, when I say, hey, you know, there's other two other companies we're going to
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.64 have in the last 18 months and then so maybe we should and I give you some time and out,
00:12:14.64 --> 00:12:19.04 you know, maybe we wait another year and I give you some kind of an out where you go, yeah,
00:12:19.04 --> 00:12:20.40 you know, that's probably a good idea.
00:12:24.08 --> 00:12:27.28 So we're still, we still have a possibility that you kind of see
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:31.44 what a good move is and you're kind of on board with what I'm saying, which is what I'm
00:12:31.44 --> 00:12:34.16 trying to do this whole time is I'm trying to influence you, right, trying to lead you, trying to
00:12:34.16 --> 00:12:39.04 influence you. Then it's just straight up, I'm just going to tell you what the shortfalls are.
00:12:41.20 --> 00:12:50.56 And if that doesn't happen, you know, offer them another option, what's another option to
00:12:50.56 --> 00:12:57.68 their plan, what's another option to their behavior? You know, hey, maybe putting stores directly in
00:12:57.68 --> 00:13:02.72 that neighborhood, how about this one that's, you know, four miles to the north? So yeah, you know,
00:13:02.72 --> 00:13:06.56 that's also a good neighbor. So I give you an out, I give you an option that still kind of
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:11.76 gratifies your ego and your idea, but at the same time it moves you in a little bit of a direction
00:13:11.76 --> 00:13:18.96 where I want to go. So we're still doing all right. And then the kind of the final sort of indirect
00:13:18.96 --> 00:13:28.56 way is, you know, a, a, Dave, why don't we put one in this market area over here now and then next time
00:13:28.56 --> 00:13:31.76 we'll put one in this marketer that you want to go into. So again, a lot of these are just kind of
00:13:31.76 --> 00:13:39.12 bargaining and kind of repetitive, but they're all different levels of bargaining from, hey, we do this
00:13:39.12 --> 00:13:44.000 later to, hey, we will do this or we hold off. There's a bunch of different ways to bargain through it.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.44 And then eventually, so now you go through these methods, these attempts to discuss something or
00:13:53.44 --> 00:14:00.40 to influence someone and every one of these attempts is an indirect attempt. Every one of these
00:14:00.40 --> 00:14:06.48 attempts is me trying to get you to kind of come on board with what I'm saying without,
00:14:06.48 --> 00:14:14.40 well, buy your own, buy your own volition. Right. It's your choice that you say, yeah, you know what we
00:14:14.40 --> 00:14:19.04 should do this later or yeah, you know what that, my art market area to the north is good. So all those
00:14:19.04 --> 00:14:25.36 are your choice, every one of these I'm giving you to you, every one of these attempts, but we
00:14:25.36 --> 00:14:33.52 might fail even with all those attempts. And then at some point, you know, so in the Marine Corps,
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:37.84 what they do is they go through this whole continuum and then they get eventually to this point
00:14:37.84 --> 00:14:42.64 where they cross the threshold of violence. So what does that look like in influence? What does that
00:14:42.64 --> 00:14:51.28 look like in leadership? It's the threshold of going from indirect to direct. And now I am absolutely
00:14:51.28 --> 00:14:55.04 is going to cost me leadership capital. At this time, I'm now, it's not going to cost me leadership
00:14:55.04 --> 00:14:59.36 capital, which hey, look, there's times we have leadership capital in the bank and if I've been
00:14:59.36 --> 00:15:04.40 working with Dave for five years and we've done a bunch of stuff and it's all gone great and he's
00:15:04.40 --> 00:15:08.64 risen up through the company and all of a sudden I got to call in some chips and say hey man,
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:13.52 you know what we're not doing that and he goes, God, you know, I'm not saying it doesn't cost me
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:22.24 something but I can afford it. But when you cross the threshold of from indirect to direct,
00:15:22.24 --> 00:15:25.76 now it's definitely going to cost you like I said, you might have money in the bank, but you
00:15:25.76 --> 00:15:30.32 might have leadership capital in the bank, but it's going to cost you. So now, now is when we're saying hey,
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:36.08 you know what, we're going to have to we cannot go into that marketer. Again, this is the most
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:42.80 gent toy to do it. It's we, you know, it's us, it's our team, I'm on your side, you know, we, we can't
00:15:42.80 --> 00:15:49.84 go into that market area right now. And you know, then the response could still be, you know,
00:15:49.84 --> 00:15:54.64 if Dave's, if Dave's my subordinate and Dave's start, you know, he most people get to say
00:15:54.64 --> 00:15:59.92 we can't go into it. Most people get to hit and by the way, we'll get to this. The number of times
00:15:59.92 --> 00:16:07.60 that I make it in across the threshold of direct is so, so, so menous, fuel, I can't remember times.
00:16:10.64 --> 00:16:15.28 So most people by the same say, like, we cannot do that. We cannot go into that marketer. They go,
00:16:15.92 --> 00:16:19.92 joc was got a pretty good, oh, yeah, and they, they feel a little bit of it. They feel that
00:16:19.92 --> 00:16:24.32 direct and they immediately say, okay, I got it. I see where, I see where we're going with this. It's not
00:16:24.32 --> 00:16:34.08 happening. Of course, sometimes does work, right? Sometimes you say, no, this, this is what we are doing.
00:16:34.08 --> 00:16:39.44 We are not going in there. And it can even escalate to no Dave, you cannot open up another store
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:46.32 of that. Now, this is direct. This is it. I'm ordering you because I'm the boss. I'm ordering you,
00:16:46.32 --> 00:16:51.36 we will not go into that market area. We are not going to build a store there. And then you,
00:16:51.36 --> 00:16:55.52 we'll not do that. So this is a direct thing. It's not even me anymore. It's not even us. It's you.
00:16:57.84 --> 00:17:04.72 And then what happens after that? What happens after that is now you, now you have to have a
00:17:04.72 --> 00:17:08.24 stick, right? Outcomes us because we, we were, we had to care it out for a while.
00:17:09.68 --> 00:17:13.36 And some of those bargaining can be carats. Hey, Dave, you know, if you can hold off on that
00:17:13.36 --> 00:17:17.12 merit marketer, I'll give you this other marketer over here. That's a carrot. I use that carrot.
00:17:17.12 --> 00:17:20.80 I didn't mention it, but yeah, that's another indirect way. If I can draw you away from this
00:17:20.80 --> 00:17:27.52 bad area to this other area with a carrot, that's positive. We just got a bunch of intel that this
00:17:27.52 --> 00:17:32.32 other market areas really start and ramp up. Why don't you put something there? All of a sudden,
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:36.64 you go, oh, yeah, okay, I didn't know that cool. You jump on that carrot. Well, now, when you don't,
00:17:36.64 --> 00:17:39.92 when you go through this escalation, now I add some point I have to get out of stick.
00:17:39.92 --> 00:17:47.04 And say, if you try and open up something in that market area, I'm actually going to remove you
00:17:47.04 --> 00:17:52.48 from that position, or I'm going to dock your pay or whatever the punishment becomes. I'll write
00:17:52.48 --> 00:18:00.24 you up, whatever it's going to become. And that's sort of where we get to, you know, theoretically
00:18:00.24 --> 00:18:05.28 in the business world of the highest level of escalation is like, I'm going to fire you, right?
00:18:05.28 --> 00:18:09.68 If you don't do what I'm telling you to do, you are going to get fired. I'm going to fire you.
00:18:10.40 --> 00:18:15.28 And of course, you go outside the business world, you go into the streets as they say. Well,
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:20.88 there's the threat of violence comes next, which is, hey, you either get, you either move your
00:18:20.88 --> 00:18:26.32 car out of my parking space, or I'm going to punch you in the head. That's a threat of violence.
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:32.56 And what happens after that? Violence. I grab you. I put you back in your car, and I, you know,
00:18:32.56 --> 00:18:40.000 don't say you better back out of this thing right now. And, and if you really want to take this
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.48 to the next level, the ultimate is the, the existential threat, which is if you don't do what I'm
00:18:48.48 --> 00:18:53.84 telling you to do, I'm going to kill you. Right? So, so, and it's important to, it's important to
00:18:53.84 --> 00:18:59.60 understand what that that's there. And I'll tell you why, because a lot of people, they want to
00:18:59.60 --> 00:19:07.52 start. They want to start this, this continuum at the threat. That's where they begin. That's where
00:19:07.52 --> 00:19:13.28 they begin with their employees. They start with, this is what you're going to do. That's where they
00:19:13.28 --> 00:19:21.04 start. And once, once you, once you cross, here's the thing. So, once you cross that threshold
00:19:21.04 --> 00:19:26.24 of director overt, that's another good word, overt leadership. Meaning, I'm telling you exactly,
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:30.56 this is totally overt. There's no, there's no influence happening there. It's just me telling
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:37.20 you what's going to happen. And when we do that, when we, when you start out there, you just don't
00:19:37.20 --> 00:19:45.68 have anywhere to go. You don't have anywhere else to go. So, the lower you are on the continuum,
00:19:48.48 --> 00:19:54.96 the better off you are as a leader. And in fact, in fact, if you go negative, if I go,
00:19:54.96 --> 00:19:59.68 if I'm your boss, Dave, and I go negative, and I actually let you influence me. And I say,
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:04.24 you know what, Dave, that looks like a great marketer. I had any think of going in there. Let's do it.
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:10.32 I'm gaining more, even more leadership capital. So, it's even better if I'm in the negative,
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:18.88 if I'm in that other chart where you're actually influencing me. So, if we can do that,
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:26.08 then we don't ever have to get to that threshold. And I, like I said, I, the amount of times
00:20:26.08 --> 00:20:33.68 I've crossed that threshold in my life from a leadership perspective is freaking tiny. And I'll
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:38.32 tell you where let's just start one place that happens all the time. It happens with kids all the time.
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:46.24 Right? Of kids all the time, it's, it's, it's clean your room. Why? Because I said so, there you go.
00:20:46.24 --> 00:20:52.72 Yep, you just went right to the, hey, direct over, I'm going to order you what to do,
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:59.04 horrible thing to do. What happens with employees? Happens up and down the chain to command.
00:20:59.04 --> 00:21:07.44 And here's what's interesting. When you are, when you cross the threshold of,
00:21:07.44 --> 00:21:18.08 of direct and you cross the threshold of overt, you, there's a, there's a equal and opposite reaction.
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:23.68 Right? So, every time you bark at someone, they, they might do what you said, but there is
00:21:23.68 --> 00:21:29.12 an equal and opposite reaction that they are looking for you to fail. They're looking to sabotage
00:21:29.12 --> 00:21:33.60 or looking to cause problems. The stronger the order is the more you yell at somebody, the stronger
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:41.84 that backlash is going to be. That's the reality of the situation. And a lot of people, a lot of
00:21:41.84 --> 00:21:48.16 people need to think about this. So, in the same way that the Marine Corps put together this manual
00:21:48.96 --> 00:21:55.92 to let everybody know that there's, that they're competing all the time. You should also know that
00:21:55.92 --> 00:22:00.40 there's a continuum that, you're on a continuum of competition all the time. And there's also a
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:04.48 continuum of leadership. And by the way, it's up and down the chain of command too. And I'm not
00:22:04.48 --> 00:22:09.60 going to like dig deep into this right now. We'll do it later. But when you talk about up the chain of
00:22:09.60 --> 00:22:15.36 command, there's a continuum as well. It starts off with just compliance. Dave tells me to do something
00:22:15.36 --> 00:22:21.20 he's my boss. Cool. I do it. What's the next level? I question what he's saying. Hey, Dave, why are we doing
00:22:21.20 --> 00:22:25.04 that? What's the next level? Hey, Dave, I don't think we should do that. We get some resistance going.
00:22:25.04 --> 00:22:31.52 Then we get to objection. This is a bad idea. And then we eventually get to refusal. And then we get to
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:36.16 mute and so there's a continuum there as well. And there's some people that start off, you know,
00:22:36.16 --> 00:22:40.40 if they don't have a, if they're not thinking strategically, they go right to this, this is still making
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:44.56 sense. That's where they go right to. They're jumping right there. And now all of a sudden, what are
00:22:44.56 --> 00:22:47.84 they going to get back? An equal and opposite reaction, which says, shut up and do what I told you to do.
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:58.64 So we don't want to go to war. We want to build relationships. We want to build relationships with
00:22:58.64 --> 00:23:02.000 other country. We're other nation states. We want to have a relation. We don't want to go to war.
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.68 War costs us money and lives. We don't want that. We don't want to go to war with our employees.
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:16.64 We don't want to go to war with our teammates. If you recognize this continuum, you can start to say,
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:21.60 oh, I see what's going on. I'm escalating. How much am I going to escalate? What's the next
00:23:21.60 --> 00:23:28.24 lowest minimum step I could take in my escalation? So that's what we need to do. We need to pay attention
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:37.36 of that. I don't have to do this. I can barely think of times when I've had to do this.
00:23:38.96 --> 00:23:43.84 And why is because I listen up one other people have to say, I dig in. I mean, I don't dig into
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:48.64 my position. I don't think my position is infinitely better than yours. I think probably if you
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:53.92 and I both want to kill bad guys and win the war, our ideas are going to be pretty close. I think
00:23:53.92 --> 00:24:00.24 if we both want to take care of our clients and make profit, our ideas are going to be pretty close.
00:24:00.24 --> 00:24:05.52 They're going to be pretty close. Close enough that I can be fairly agreeable with whatever it is
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:13.44 someone else wants to do. But it's a continuum that we have to pay attention to just like
00:24:13.44 --> 00:24:22.24 competing. What do you got Dave? You're over there taking notes. I was just thinking,
00:24:22.24 --> 00:24:26.80 I mean, I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm making the connection and you're using
00:24:26.80 --> 00:24:32.16 examples that I actually get to live. I lived in the military, but I get to live that now too,
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:34.88 because I've released the clients we work with. I've released ships inside of the Shlon
00:24:34.88 --> 00:24:40.32 front. I've released ships at different ways, even with you and there are times that you and
00:24:40.32 --> 00:24:44.000 are working together. There are times that you're helping me, almost in a support role with
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.68 the client and there's times that you're the CEO of the company. I'm running one of the departments.
00:24:49.20 --> 00:24:53.20 As you're talking about that, I'm picturing this continuum. Where's the threat of violence?
00:24:53.20 --> 00:24:59.12 Where does physical violence or where does war come in? The more you make deposits or the more
00:24:59.12 --> 00:25:06.96 you take the indirect approach, the more you get to keep doing that and the more you go to the
00:25:06.96 --> 00:25:13.36 direct threat, the more you have to use that. And just the idea of the recognition is that
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:18.56 and I'm just thinking of those terms of the more indirect you are. The more leadership deposits I make,
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:24.40 the more that's the technique I get to use, because the more I let you influence me, the more
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:27.84 likely you're going to be doing the things you want to do that help us get to the end state. And I never
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:32.48 have to, I never have to move down that, that almost never have to move down that continuum. I'm
00:25:32.48 --> 00:25:38.88 trying to think of a time where I'm trying to think of a time where you had to escalate in a way that
00:25:38.88 --> 00:25:45.52 I recognized. And I've been working for years. Now, I'm not saying that that hasn't happened.
00:25:45.52 --> 00:25:49.52 I'm not saying that the escalation hasn't occurred, but it's, I can't think of a time where I went,
00:25:49.52 --> 00:25:56.16 oh, damn, I kind of, I kind of pushed him up the stair step. So it has been subtle enough. The
00:25:56.16 --> 00:26:01.52 times, however many times has happened, but the reason it works, even those subtle escalations,
00:26:01.52 --> 00:26:07.12 the reason they work is because that's the technique you always use. So the idea of the threat of
00:26:07.12 --> 00:26:12.56 violence, especially if that's your first move, it's so limiting. It gives you so few options after
00:26:12.56 --> 00:26:18.56 that, that it's such a bad, it's not a bad first move. It's even a bad six or seventh one. I think
00:26:18.56 --> 00:26:24.40 there's this idea that there are so many things. And I think the part that has leaders that I want to
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:29.44 avoid war as well, even if I'm the boss, even if I'm in charge, it's not what I want. And I think
00:26:29.44 --> 00:26:33.20 the way you close it was, is this because the equal and opposite reaction. And this satisfaction of
00:26:33.20 --> 00:26:38.72 knowing you're going to win is not should not be enough to make, and as a parent makes the most sense.
00:26:38.72 --> 00:26:42.24 I know I'm going to win that worth my get. If I tell my kid to clean his room, because I said so,
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:48.16 he is going to clean his room. What a great victory. What a win. Yeah. And, and yeah,
00:26:48.16 --> 00:26:54.08 for how long until the reaction from him becomes so big and so violent that I lose all influence
00:26:54.08 --> 00:27:03.04 over him. Yeah, the other thing is, as I brush up against, hey, well, maybe it's the time.
00:27:03.84 --> 00:27:08.88 Maybe it's the time to go direct in this situation. Most of the time, after way that against,
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:13.44 okay, well, what does that get me strategically? Right? Where does that get me strategically? If I've
00:27:13.44 --> 00:27:19.28 got to say, you know what Dave, you need to do it this way from now on. I want you to use this
00:27:19.28 --> 00:27:27.20 font on the power points, right? Whatever thing you want to come up with. Where does that get me strategically?
00:27:27.20 --> 00:27:30.24 All you have to do is take one step back and say, wait a second, where does that get me strategically?
00:27:30.24 --> 00:27:34.56 Does that improve my relationship with Dave? Does this make him want to do a better job? Does this,
00:27:34.56 --> 00:27:39.04 like you just have to take one step back and you, oh, yeah, this is dumb. This is a dumb move.
00:27:39.04 --> 00:27:45.20 What I should do is be a better influencer, have a better relationship, explain myself better,
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:50.48 do some bargaining, talk about it, maybe I'm wrong, maybe the font that he's using is actually
00:27:50.48 --> 00:27:58.80 better for these and and by the way, has he picked a font that's eligible? Right? Has he picked a
00:27:58.80 --> 00:28:05.60 font that's eligible? Is it, is it, Cyrillic? Is that the right word? I don't know. Cyrillic, is that
00:28:05.60 --> 00:28:11.28 the right word? Like the Russian? Yeah, is he picked a font that is illegible in English? Right?
00:28:11.28 --> 00:28:16.32 And then then I kind of have to make a stand, but if it's legible, if people can read it,
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:21.76 why am I freaking out? The answer is I'm stupid. I want to waste my leadership capital
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:26.80 on something that doesn't matter. But by the way, up and down the chain of command, because if I
00:28:26.80 --> 00:28:30.96 said, hey, Dave, what do you think of that font? You know what you'd say to me? You're like,
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:34.16 well, I've been using it, but what does it not look good? And I'd say, well, I don't know,
00:28:34.16 --> 00:28:38.48 it's a little bit unclear from a distance. You'd say, oh, I'm going to fall on my sword about
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:43.84 this font. No, you'd actually say, oh, which one have you been using? And I'd say, oh, I've been using
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:51.52 aerial because it has sharp edges, which I like. And you'd say, hmm, oh, click down, drop, drop the
00:28:51.52 --> 00:28:56.56 menu, there's aerial, you click on it. Yeah, you're right. That does look pretty good, Joco.
00:28:56.56 --> 00:29:01.36 And I go, gee, thank you. And you say, you know what, I'm going to change all my briefs to aerial.
00:29:01.92 --> 00:29:08.40 Because just vice versa, I'm not sitting here telling you, use Cyrillic fonts that can't be read,
00:29:08.40 --> 00:29:17.68 by English speaking humans. So you're, so what do we do? I'm offering a little suggestion,
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:22.32 and you're going, oh, yeah, that's a great suggestion. My leadership capital went up,
00:29:22.32 --> 00:29:28.000 your leadership capital went up. It's a beautiful thing. Or we can have World War VII about a font.
00:29:29.44 --> 00:29:37.20 It's such a tactical loss for you to say, it's, first of all, to tackle a loss from you to say,
00:29:37.20 --> 00:29:40.80 you need to change this font. This, you need to use aerial because that's what I use.
00:29:41.36 --> 00:29:48.16 Yeah, okay. Great. Oh, hey, by the way, it's different. That font's different on other systems.
00:29:48.16 --> 00:29:53.12 And now all of it looks like just a horrible thing. If you're smart, you go, hey, oh, you like
00:29:53.12 --> 00:30:02.000 air, cool. Got it. We're moving forward. Be surprised. Be surprised. All right,
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.16 it's interesting, isn't it? It's interesting, how you kind of use the pan fidgeting example
00:30:10.80 --> 00:30:16.24 on Dave over here, but you literally did me like that. Did I really? Yeah, we have it. Remember,
00:30:16.24 --> 00:30:22.32 I was clicking the pan. Yeah, there's on online. Oh, you need to post it there. And you,
00:30:22.32 --> 00:30:28.24 I did post it. I know what I said. I said, do you think the Mike picks up that noise? Yeah,
00:30:28.24 --> 00:30:33.84 do you think the Mike's? And you know what you said? You said no. I don't think so. But you didn't
00:30:33.84 --> 00:30:39.52 begin. No. But then you kind of clicked it a couple times while we were just quiet. And you know what you heard?
00:30:39.52 --> 00:30:45.04 Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and then I laughed. Yeah. And I did, it was weird.
00:30:45.04 --> 00:30:50.08 It kind of was, it was almost like in not slow motion, but kind of like I could slowly,
00:30:50.80 --> 00:30:56.000 within the span of our would say maybe six seconds, I slowly picked up on what you're doing there.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.56 Like why you said it like that? Like you're saying, hey, stop doing the clicking. Just stop clicking.
00:31:00.56 --> 00:31:06.08 You, that's what you're saying. And but you said it in this way. Hey, do you think that that's
00:31:06.08 --> 00:31:09.68 going to have end the way the tone, everything like you could tell you knew what you're doing with
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:16.80 the way you delivered that question. Here's the, here's the no kidding. The, the no kidding. When I
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:20.64 asked you that question, I was earnestly asking that question. Like, do you think that's going to show
00:31:20.64 --> 00:31:26.56 up? Now, it's an earnest question. Do you think that clicking is going to show up on this podcast?
00:31:27.36 --> 00:31:31.04 It's an earnest question. I probably had a pretty good suspicion because I can freaking hear it through
00:31:31.04 --> 00:31:37.12 my headphones for 15 minutes. But you got to detach from those emotions. And you got to ask
00:31:37.12 --> 00:31:40.88 an earnest question because maybe if it's not going to show up, why am I worried about it?
00:31:40.88 --> 00:31:44.40 I'm not going to let it, I'm not going to let it bother me. If it's not going to show up,
00:31:44.40 --> 00:31:48.96 it's not going to be on the audio, then who cares? I'm not going to care about that. If you want to
00:31:48.96 --> 00:31:52.32 click your panel all day, cool. It's not bothering me. It's not going to be on the, we're good.
00:31:52.32 --> 00:31:58.56 So it's an earnest question. But I mean, it's, it's, we did know the answer. Yeah. Kind of,
00:31:58.56 --> 00:32:03.52 because we can hear it. You know, it's kind of interesting. We'll say, because you know, I did
00:32:03.52 --> 00:32:08.000 kind of say, no, I don't think so. I forget exactly what I said. We'll get the replay. Yeah. But I
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.48 feel like if I remember correctly, I was kind of, at least at the very least, implied that, like,
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:17.92 no, no, no, it's all good. Almost. For just for a split second, though, your thing is that was a
00:32:17.92 --> 00:32:24.16 version of me, like defensively. I was about to say that was that was an instinctual defense.
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:29.60 It's instinctual. Exactly. Like that instinctual defense. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but I was so,
00:32:29.60 --> 00:32:36.40 it was so not, like, just natural. Yeah. But it was so not called for, like, on a, like, a primal
00:32:36.40 --> 00:32:40.88 level. If you were, like, it was so not called for that. I felt that it was so not called for,
00:32:40.88 --> 00:32:46.56 and I don't, I don't have to dig in on this. Clicking the pan. Let's face it. Like, I know that it's,
00:32:46.56 --> 00:32:51.04 like, a habit. You know, I mean, clicking bends to have it. And then what made it additionally
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:55.60 interesting, just a little teeny tiny interaction was that, I was like, oh, man, I do it, like,
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.60 I got a habit, right? There's the excuses, like, trying to explain, like, I do how to have it.
00:32:59.60 --> 00:33:03.28 And then, instead of you saying, mirror those two excuses or whatever, you were just like,
00:33:03.28 --> 00:33:07.84 oh, and then you grabbed, like, the nearest non-clicking pan and just simply gave me some
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:15.28 bargaining. Red option. That's, that's the carrot, right? The carrot, like, oh, maybe
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:22.000 do you get your attention from that? Yeah, there you go. Perfect. You know, the, the things that fall into
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.36 the category of indirect and direct, like the techniques you can use can actually, I was thinking
00:33:27.36 --> 00:33:32.72 about that conversation can actually change. If early in a relationship or relationship that doesn't
00:33:32.72 --> 00:33:36.16 have a lot of mutual respect or you don't have any of that leadership capital built,
00:33:36.88 --> 00:33:42.16 you can say, hey, Dave, don't, don't click your pan. And I'd be like, okay, I probably comply,
00:33:42.16 --> 00:33:47.12 but am I mine? I like, dude, what's the deal? And I, I might have that natural, that little reaction,
00:33:47.12 --> 00:33:51.12 that little ego hit, and then that little resistance, or even maybe little resentment,
00:33:51.12 --> 00:33:55.28 whatever it is. And this is a small example, but it would fit in the category of direct.
00:33:55.28 --> 00:34:01.60 I don't naturally like that. But over time, if you've actually done the things you're just talking
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:07.76 about, and you've built enough capital, what falls as indirect or influence, that actually can
00:34:07.76 --> 00:34:11.60 expand. You can say to me, right now, hey, don't click that pan. And I'm going to have no
00:34:11.60 --> 00:34:14.88 reaction to it. Because I'm going to think, oh, he's only telling me that for my own benefit,
00:34:14.88 --> 00:34:19.04 for the benefit of the body. I'm not going to have that reaction, so that what appears to be a
00:34:19.04 --> 00:34:23.12 direct that you're saying something directly to me, I don't even register that as a direct,
00:34:23.12 --> 00:34:28.000 and that actually fits in the category of, at a minimum, there's no withdrawal there. So even
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.60 the things that you do as little as they are, the options for indirect leadership actually
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:37.36 can grow. Things that would normally be outside there, where I would have some sort of problem
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:44.000 with you saying that, where I think, a mustard three, and you go, hey, when you're doing Q&A,
00:34:45.04 --> 00:34:49.52 you say, I think you said something like, you say, in between, don't do that anymore.
00:34:50.64 --> 00:34:58.64 And the way you said it didn't bother me at all. But it could be that if you have that conversation
00:34:58.64 --> 00:35:02.56 with somebody, and you don't have any leadership capital, they might not like that. So you
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:07.60 being able to say that to me is a function of the trust that we have, the influence that we shared,
00:35:07.60 --> 00:35:11.20 and the amount of leadership capital, you have that you can actually kind of be direct,
00:35:11.60 --> 00:35:15.36 and it doesn't bother me that it would, in a way that it would, had just come at, you know,
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:19.84 day one, we're like, I don't like the way you talk, do it differently. And I'm not going to like that,
00:35:19.84 --> 00:35:24.64 no matter who I am. So even what you can do, what you can get away with in a sense of what is still
00:35:24.64 --> 00:35:31.60 a leadership capital deposit, that will grow as well. Yeah, that's, that's why it's all
00:35:31.60 --> 00:35:37.20 interlaced with leadership capital. Because if you start off day one by saying, I don't like the
00:35:37.20 --> 00:35:43.28 way you talk, that's, you use went into a deficit immediately. And now you got to dig your way out of that.
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:47.76 That's why it's totally interlaced with leadership capital. Because the more leadership capital you have,
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.76 the more when you need to now, if I said, hey, Dave, you're saying, oh, when you talk and hey,
00:35:53.76 --> 00:35:58.08 Dave, this answer was bad and hey, Dave, the way you presented this, your slides were all,
00:35:58.08 --> 00:36:02.96 they didn't look good and hate. And I just started everything was negative. Well, I'm going to
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:06.64 eventually going to run out of leadership capital and start going in a bad way. And you're, you're out of
00:36:06.64 --> 00:36:12.80 two, just, all chocolate does is just tell me what I do wrong. And I guess I can't do anything right.
00:36:12.80 --> 00:36:16.000 And I guess I just don't even need to be here. And I think you go look for another job. It's just,
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.72 you know, because I've, I've expended all my leadership capital. So it's completely intertwined with
00:36:20.72 --> 00:36:27.28 leadership capital, completely intertwined with leadership capital. But just like, you know, I said this on
00:36:27.28 --> 00:36:31.92 EF online the other day, I people usually think they have more leadership capital than they do.
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:39.04 They usually think they're just rolling deep in in in leadership capital in their own little heads.
00:36:39.04 --> 00:36:49.36 They think, of course. So I always kind of treat every situation as if, okay, you know, I'm,
00:36:49.36 --> 00:36:53.60 I'm lean. I'm running lean. It's going to be lean Christmas. That's my parents used to tell me.
00:36:53.60 --> 00:36:59.44 It's going to be lean Christmas. So I always think, I don't have leadership capital to spare because
00:36:59.44 --> 00:37:04.96 also what if I really need leadership capital tomorrow? What if tomorrow? I go, hey, Dave,
00:37:06.40 --> 00:37:12.88 I know it's your, your anniversary, your tenure anniversary, your 20 year anniversary, whatever. And I know
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:16.80 that you're supposed to go to the mountains with your life for three days. And we just had a
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:23.12 client call and you now have to go to Oklahoma to talk to them. And I might have to do that.
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:28.80 Tomorrow. And that's the way it is. So am I really, how much, how, where do I want that account?
00:37:29.52 --> 00:37:33.28 Right. I want that account to be as built up as I possibly can. So that means I'm not going to waste
00:37:33.28 --> 00:37:38.000 leadership capital on little things that don't matter. Not going to happen. Yeah. That's why the default
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.64 no matter where you are should almost always be almost always be on that side of the default should be on
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:47.60 that side of this spectrum. Yeah. And it's weird too because you have the, you have the threshold of violence,
00:37:47.60 --> 00:37:55.20 we have the, on the continuum, on the war continuum, on the competing continuum, there's a
00:37:55.20 --> 00:38:00.16 threshold of violence. There's actual real violence with with influencing people. Like you have to
00:38:00.16 --> 00:38:04.96 admit that that you can push people around and you can smack them and you can beat them up. That's
00:38:04.96 --> 00:38:11.28 a, there's a, there's a threshold of violence on the, on the influence on the influence continuum.
00:38:11.28 --> 00:38:16.80 Before that, there's, there's a one between direct and indirect. So you cross that one, which is
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:21.36 a huge one. That's like the big one. Yeah. Now, of course, I guess the threshold of violence is a
00:38:21.36 --> 00:38:28.24 big one too on influence because now you're getting charged with a salt or murder or murder, depending on
00:38:28.24 --> 00:38:32.96 what level of violence you took a deal of. So it's important to think about these things.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.60 And with that, we're going to jump into this, this, this whole thing, man. I mean, I just like,
00:38:41.60 --> 00:38:46.72 I've just been thinking about this nonstop, which is pretty normal for me to think about these
00:38:46.72 --> 00:38:55.44 things, nonstop. So competing for US Marine Corps brand new manual one tack for it's called
00:38:55.44 --> 00:39:00.08 competing last last time we covered chapter one this time we're covering chapter two. This one's
00:39:00.08 --> 00:39:06.24 chapter two is called the theory of competition. And it says competition as an active policy
00:39:07.20 --> 00:39:12.96 as states engage in competition or try to shape the competitions on going among the range of
00:39:12.96 --> 00:39:19.68 state and nonstate actors involved in areas of interest to states they develop policies frame
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:25.20 to frame order and apply resources to this activity. Marines need to understand policy,
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:32.64 how it's developed and how it relates to ongoing competition. My little note here just says,
00:39:32.64 --> 00:39:39.76 what are you doing? This is me making notes to myself, what are you doing? What are you doing? Where are
00:39:39.76 --> 00:39:46.64 you at? Do you know what your what competition are you in? You know, I had a it was an early
00:39:46.64 --> 00:39:50.48 part, it was a pretty early podcast, I don't know which one, but when I started talking about
00:39:50.48 --> 00:39:57.84 what game are you playing and and you can be playing the wrong game with your life and if you're
00:39:57.84 --> 00:40:03.04 looking up and you're like, man, I'm doing everything I can but I just I'm not putting any points on the
00:40:03.04 --> 00:40:08.40 board. Well, if you're playing soccer, you might not be putting any points on the board because there's
00:40:08.40 --> 00:40:15.84 only one goal a game or three, maybe you should be playing basketball, we can score 48 points again.
00:40:17.44 --> 00:40:21.84 So with this competition, what are you competing in? And who are you competing against?
00:40:23.84 --> 00:40:28.40 Goes on, Marines are frequently asked to provide input to policymakers as they deliberate.
00:40:29.28 --> 00:40:35.84 Understanding the larger context around policy decisions helps Marines determine the broader
00:40:35.84 --> 00:40:43.12 intent behind specific decisions which in turn helps us make sound supporting plants. What does
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:48.24 that mean? Everyone should know why they're doing what they're doing. Like war, Marines should
00:40:48.24 --> 00:40:55.36 think of competition as serving policy. Since we acknowledge competition as an enduring condition,
00:40:56.72 --> 00:41:01.36 that's a great, that's a great phrase, one would adopt that one, enduring condition. It's just
00:41:01.36 --> 00:41:07.92 ongoing. It's forever. In internal relations, then we need to take equally and equally long
00:41:07.92 --> 00:41:12.48 view when it comes to policy as well. US vital interests have remained relatively stable over time.
00:41:12.48 --> 00:41:16.48 For example, since World War II, they've been framed in various ways while consistently calling
00:41:16.48 --> 00:41:21.44 for the maintenance of our constitutional values, protection of the American homeland and people,
00:41:21.44 --> 00:41:25.84 promotion of American prosperity and the advancement of the American influence in the world.
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:32.96 The contemporary environment will affect these specifics of policy, but the enduring
00:41:32.96 --> 00:41:38.48 foundation for it consists of stable interests such as these. So what, what the reason I
00:41:38.48 --> 00:41:42.48 and again, sometimes I look like, oh, we can kind of breathe over this part. No, I know you can't.
00:41:43.36 --> 00:41:48.08 Because if you, if you think about your life, okay, you can think about your business for sure.
00:41:48.08 --> 00:41:53.12 What is it that your business is trying to do? Like do you think a Marine wakes up in the morning and says,
00:41:53.12 --> 00:41:57.44 okay, today I'm going to maintain our, the maintain our constitutional values.
00:41:57.44 --> 00:42:01.04 Is he saying, all right, I've got to protect the American homeland. People, we kind of, we kind of
00:42:01.04 --> 00:42:05.44 know that one promotion of American prosperity. So there's these, there's these things. They're
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:12.24 so big, such big strategic goals that they shape every decision that you make. They should
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:17.60 the advancement of American influence around the world. If a Marine goes out and does something
00:42:17.60 --> 00:42:25.36 stupid in name a foreign country goes out and acts like gun to get strong and act like an idiot,
00:42:25.36 --> 00:42:28.000 has he helped the advancement of American influence in the world? No, he hasn't.
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:34.48 And that's what he's going to hear from his commanding officer. You just made all Marines
00:42:34.48 --> 00:42:38.48 to look bad and you just made America look bad by getting drunk and getting a fighter,
00:42:38.48 --> 00:42:45.04 whatever you did that will stupid. And that Marine can't deny that. He says, Roger Sir,
00:42:45.04 --> 00:42:50.80 it was a bad move. If that Marine would have been thinking a little bit more strategic,
00:42:51.52 --> 00:42:56.000 maybe he would have maintained a little bit more level ahead on the bears. You know, I had a Marine
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.36 one time. I was on a ship. I was on a ship and look, we know we know that I love the Marine
00:43:03.36 --> 00:43:09.68 corps. I was on a ship. And when you'd pull and to port, you have to get in line to get off the
00:43:09.68 --> 00:43:13.36 ship. And sometimes it take an hour or two hours. So what we would do is we'd work out,
00:43:13.36 --> 00:43:18.88 as soon as we got, as soon as we hit the pier, we would work out. This is like 1990, whatever.
00:43:19.52 --> 00:43:24.000 We'd hit the pier, work out. And by the time we got done working out, took a shower,
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.04 then you could just walk right off the ship because all the Marines were already gone. So once
00:43:27.04 --> 00:43:30.72 time I did that, like me and my buddies, we got, we hit the pier, we start working out,
00:43:30.72 --> 00:43:34.48 we get done working out, take a shower. It's been an hour and a half. We come walking up to leave.
00:43:35.20 --> 00:43:40.80 So these guys have been off the ship without that. They are carrying a young Marine back on the ship,
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:48.64 just completely brain dead from alcohol. So, you gotta be careful out there.
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:54.80 But so, so when you look at, if you look at the Marine corps has these kind of broad things that
00:43:54.80 --> 00:44:00.000 they're saying, this is what we're doing. What do you have in your life? What do you have in your business?
00:44:00.72 --> 00:44:04.80 What do you have in your business? Okay, just like that young Marine, if he's lead well,
00:44:04.80 --> 00:44:10.32 he's going to say, you know what? The home Marine Corps is relying on me to make America look
00:44:10.32 --> 00:44:18.96 good. God, that's sort of good Marine is going to say. If you're running a business and you've got
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:23.44 a cashier, I've been using cashiers a lot because you know why? Because they're front line and
00:44:23.44 --> 00:44:28.08 they're interacting with people. If you've got a cashier that treats a customer bad, he's making
00:44:28.08 --> 00:44:31.68 the whole company look bad. If you doesn't know that, okay, and then what about your life?
00:44:31.68 --> 00:44:36.56 What are you trying to do in your life? What are you trying to, where are you trying to go with your
00:44:36.56 --> 00:44:44.96 life? What's the broad, what's the broad strategic mark that you're trying to make? Do you have one?
00:44:45.92 --> 00:44:52.72 Do you have one? And if you don't have one, how are you making decisions? You're making decisions
00:44:52.72 --> 00:45:04.24 for with no, with no steering whatsoever, without a compass. So these are enduring interests.
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:10.72 And during interest provide Marines a potential source of competitive advantage.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.32 At hearing to our values, when done as part of a comprehensive strategy,
00:45:16.32 --> 00:45:22.64 you can serve to attract others and work in harmony with Marines with what Marines learned from
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:29.28 an early age. Value such as freedom of expression and press freedom can help frustrate the plans
00:45:29.28 --> 00:45:35.76 of some competitors. Positive some interests such as increasing American prosperity also help
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:42.72 attract allies and partners. This is especially true when we can show how our interests align
00:45:42.72 --> 00:45:50.000 with theirs. And that interesting. If we can work together, we're going to be better off. We're
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.96 stronger together. We're stronger together than we are fighting each other.
00:45:52.96 --> 00:46:03.92 Domestic politics affects the policy decisions of almost all competitors and the resulting
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:13.92 character of all nearly all competitions. Everything you do, everything you do impacts,
00:46:13.92 --> 00:46:19.84 the competitors and the competition itself. As mentioned in chapter one,
00:46:19.84 --> 00:46:23.68 there are often multiple centers of power in each nation and the struggle amongst them often
00:46:23.68 --> 00:46:28.80 creates ambiguity in the minds of outside observers. These struggles affect internal politics and
00:46:28.80 --> 00:46:33.60 often drive or limit current policy choices. This is true in the United States. For example,
00:46:33.60 --> 00:46:38.72 when we see the deliberations on national policy among three co-equal branches of the government,
00:46:38.72 --> 00:46:43.68 in other less open societies, domestic considerations have major impact on policy,
00:46:43.68 --> 00:46:48.000 even though these considerations are often harder for outsiders to understand.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.48 This happens in businesses a lot. You've got some people with different ideas of how we're
00:46:52.48 --> 00:46:56.64 going to get where we're going, sometimes unfortunately, even disagree on where they're going,
00:46:56.64 --> 00:47:03.28 which is bad. And that's something with all the political mayhem that we're facing in America right now.
00:47:03.92 --> 00:47:09.68 I guess maybe mayhem's well, with what we're facing right now, we'll just call it. We want
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:16.48 put a, we don't want to sign a word to it because different people will sign at different words.
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:28.48 We'll say that there's disagreements in America right? But this is what, this is a democracy
00:47:28.48 --> 00:47:36.000 is going to be messy, but you're going to get a better result in the end. So if you, if you
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.68 have a platoon where, hey, I'm going to take input from the troops, so they're going to let me know
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:44.24 and sometimes they're going to argue with me about some stuff and not argue, but we're going to
00:47:44.24 --> 00:47:47.68 disagree about some things. Now, if it turns into an argument, we start fighting, that's bad.
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:53.20 But for, for my point, man, to say, hey, Joc, I don't think that's a good route to get into the
00:47:53.20 --> 00:47:56.72 target. And me to say, well, why not? And for us to have a discussion about that's totally
00:47:56.72 --> 00:47:59.76 positive thing. I want to come to a better conclusion. That's what's supposed to happen in democracy.
00:48:00.48 --> 00:48:05.84 We have a discussion, but we're both trying to get to the target. My point, man, once to get there,
00:48:05.84 --> 00:48:12.80 I want to get there. In America, we've got, what are we trying to do? We've got a hope that we are
00:48:12.80 --> 00:48:20.32 aligned enough that we say, oh, we want our economy to get better. Okay, can anyone, is anyone disagree
00:48:20.32 --> 00:48:25.12 with that? All right, maybe we disagree on how we get there, but at least we have this one thing
00:48:25.12 --> 00:48:31.20 that we know we're moving towards. And you can say that, about what do we want? There to be
00:48:31.20 --> 00:48:35.76 poverty in the country. Does anyone that says, yeah, well, I really think we need in America's
00:48:35.76 --> 00:48:39.68 more poverty? No, no one's saying that. There's not one person that's saying we need more poverty
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:45.44 in America. So no matter who you are, you're saying, yep, you know what, we don't want poverty.
00:48:45.44 --> 00:48:49.76 We want less poverty. Great. Now, you might think we get there one way. Someone else thinks you
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:53.36 get there. Another way. Okay, let's figure out what those things are. And then we can discuss
00:48:53.36 --> 00:48:58.16 how we get there. But it's okay if we disagree, because we're just trying to find the best solution.
00:48:58.72 --> 00:49:03.60 And when Dave's solution is different to me than me than how we get to the target, and he's the
00:49:03.60 --> 00:49:08.32 point, man. And I say, shut up, we're going my way. And he goes, no, we're not that stupid. And now,
00:49:08.32 --> 00:49:13.60 we're in a fist fight. Our platoon is falling apart. So what we do is we listen to each other.
00:49:13.60 --> 00:49:19.36 And we look for the best possible solution. And maybe, you know, as you, I always try and just agree
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:24.80 with the other person. What does that mean? Does that mean I just always bow down and say, oh,
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:28.80 you know what, Dave, you know, I can't make a new decision. So we're going with the Dave says, no,
00:49:29.36 --> 00:49:33.76 because Dave wants to go one way that I think is going to take an extra 15 minutes.
00:49:33.76 --> 00:49:40.88 The route that Dave chooses as the point man is going to take an extra 15 minutes. So you know what,
00:49:40.88 --> 00:49:45.52 we're not doing it that way. We have a seven hour patrol. My way is going to take seven hours.
00:49:45.52 --> 00:49:52.16 Dave's way is going to take seven hours and 15 minutes. We're doing my way. No, actually, Dave,
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:56.48 you know what, your way sounds great. Why? Because I already said, I just, I just in that moment,
00:49:56.48 --> 00:50:02.56 I saved 30 minutes of you and I arguing about it. And now we can focus on something more important.
00:50:02.56 --> 00:50:07.76 And by the way, we're still getting to the target. And by the way, there's so many unknowns on that route
00:50:07.76 --> 00:50:11.76 that I don't know and you don't know. And no one can know. And so I'm actually arguing about something
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:16.08 that I have no idea where the landmines, where is the, what is the actual terrain like, what,
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:20.000 how tall is that little cliff that I see? Is that something we can get up or do you need to
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.16 bring ropes? And also, it takes 45 minutes just to get up that little thing. We got to carry extra gear.
00:50:24.16 --> 00:50:29.84 I don't know any of that. So guess what? Am I going to argue with you for 15 minutes of
00:50:29.84 --> 00:50:35.60 difference? No. Sounds good, Dave. So why don't I have to, why can I let Dave do whatever,
00:50:35.60 --> 00:50:40.32 why can I almost always say I'm going to go with someone else's plan? Because I work with Dave
00:50:40.32 --> 00:50:47.52 for long enough. And by the way, I actually taught Dave land navigation. So when Dave comes to me,
00:50:47.52 --> 00:50:51.52 and he says, hey, here's how I think we should go. There's a 98% chance that it's pretty freaking
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:55.04 close to what I would do in the first place. And by the way, either way, we still get to the target,
00:50:55.04 --> 00:51:06.56 which is where we're going. Back to the book. For United States Marines,
00:51:06.56 --> 00:51:12.08 understanding current policy relies in part on understanding the interplay between domestic
00:51:12.08 --> 00:51:17.28 politics and our enduring vital national interests. Shouldn't everyone just kind of have
00:51:17.28 --> 00:51:22.88 enduring vital interests for their family, for their business, for their life? Shouldn't we all
00:51:22.88 --> 00:51:29.92 have those things? Yes, we should. As a nation, yes, we should. As specs of domestic politics,
00:51:29.92 --> 00:51:36.000 like the election cycle and contemporary societal issues affect current policy, these aspects are typically
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.64 felt by Marines through such things, resourcing decisions, guidance on the composition of the
00:51:40.64 --> 00:51:47.84 force and specific direction to focus, particular national interests or particular competitors.
00:51:47.84 --> 00:51:53.52 You should know the story about what's going on. That whole thing right there, hey,
00:51:53.52 --> 00:52:00.000 Corporal Smith that just heard me read that that said, hey, bro, I'm not I'm not I'm not tracking.
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:06.24 What this means is you need to know it's just just understand what's happening in the world.
00:52:06.24 --> 00:52:09.68 And understanding that what's happening in the world is going to sort of guide what the Marine
00:52:09.68 --> 00:52:18.08 Corps is doing. International competition, particularly among nations, plays out over a long timeline.
00:52:18.08 --> 00:52:24.48 Oh, what timeline is that? Life. Pursuing the goals put forth by the Constitution and its
00:52:24.48 --> 00:52:29.20 amendments has been an enduring vital interest to the United States since the day became effective in
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:36.72 1789. This contrast with our desire to bring war to a conclusion as quickly as possible.
00:52:36.72 --> 00:52:46.16 Marines need to understand this distinction. Competitive advantage.
00:52:47.68 --> 00:52:52.72 Advantage is relative to a competitor when one actor is able to do something better than its
00:52:52.72 --> 00:53:01.60 rival or rivals. Check, we get that. What's a corporal terminal lance? That's sort of,
00:53:01.60 --> 00:53:07.52 that's, we should be using terminal lance. That guy's legit. Terminal lance is a
00:53:07.52 --> 00:53:12.56 he's a cartoon. And he's always actually a whole book too. Terminal lance props.
00:53:15.12 --> 00:53:18.80 A business enjoys, it's interesting. Here we go back to a business. A business enjoys competitive
00:53:18.80 --> 00:53:22.64 advantage when it can sell a product at a lower price than other businesses, assuming other factors
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:27.04 like quality stay the same. Nations also have relative competitive advantages, also referred to
00:53:27.04 --> 00:53:32.24 as comparative advantages. Historically, the innovative culture in the United States helped
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:37.44 bring it new goods and services to the international marketplace faster than others. The cost
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:42.40 of labor in some countries is lower than others, which makes them more attractive for labor intensive
00:53:42.40 --> 00:53:47.44 manufacturing businesses. It follows then that we must understand our potential rivals if we are
00:53:47.44 --> 00:53:55.44 to develop and maintain a competitive advantage against them. G. We must understand our potential
00:53:55.44 --> 00:54:00.80 rivals, Sunsu, Art of War, know who you're fighting. The United States has many competitive
00:54:00.80 --> 00:54:05.36 advantage. Oh, by the way, obviously this is something that we're doing all the time at
00:54:05.36 --> 00:54:11.76 origin. Right? Well, there's we're competing against nations that make the same
00:54:12.32 --> 00:54:18.000 basic product that we make, but they're doing it with slave labor or they're doing it with
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.52 someone that's getting paid in horrible working conditions. And so we've had to find ways and we
00:54:23.52 --> 00:54:28.88 continue to find ways that we can compete with them. And not only are we competitive, we're better
00:54:28.88 --> 00:54:35.44 because our product ends up better. And because we're here now now you get into shipping and what
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:43.68 is it costs to ship things from overseas? What does that do to the whole picture? So we're
00:54:43.68 --> 00:54:49.20 we're figuring out and we have figured out how we have a competitive advantage, even though we
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:53.92 take care of our workers, which we actually also feel is a competitive advantage. Taking care
00:54:53.92 --> 00:54:59.20 of your people is a competitive advantage. Because now your people care about the product that they're
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:09.68 making. They want to do a good job. Not not slaving in a in a sweatshop. Instead of looking
00:55:09.68 --> 00:55:17.44 instead of looking at slave labor as an advantage, I look at as a disadvantage. We've got the
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:25.12 advantage because we have a better workforce who care about the company. The United States has many
00:55:25.12 --> 00:55:30.72 competitive advantages in international competition. The world's largest economy and an international
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:35.84 financial system that uses the dollar to make transactions are strong economic advantages. Yes,
00:55:35.84 --> 00:55:40.96 the enduring US interests in freedom of navigation on the seas attracts many partners because
00:55:40.96 --> 00:55:45.68 free navigation reduces the overall cost of trading between nations. The US higher education system
00:55:45.68 --> 00:55:50.08 attracts students from all over the world. The list goes on and on. But these illustrations show
00:55:50.08 --> 00:55:54.64 that we should look for a nation's competitive advantages among its enduring qualities, such as
00:55:54.64 --> 00:56:00.08 values, interest and culture. And this is what you need to do. So how does this tie into everybody?
00:56:00.08 --> 00:56:09.68 What about your business? How do you have the culture and do you have the values inside your
00:56:09.68 --> 00:56:16.64 business that are actually competitive advantages? Do you have that? If you don't have that,
00:56:16.64 --> 00:56:21.52 if you don't have values, if you don't have a culture, that's a competitive advantage. You're wrong.
00:56:25.44 --> 00:56:33.44 The competitive advantages in the military component of dime are naturally of great interests
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:40.72 to Marines. Since World War II, the United States made the use of several military advantages
00:56:40.72 --> 00:56:46.72 such as the joint forces of ability to project and sustain power globally. It's skillet operating
00:56:46.72 --> 00:56:52.32 across domains and its expertise in precision targeting and strike. The US military's
00:56:52.32 --> 00:56:58.000 principal professionalism can also present distinctive advantages. For example, when it's
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.32 properly contrasted with competitors seeking to extend a fairitarian government without regard
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:07.84 for rule of law or protection of civilians. So that's a huge advantage that we have is that we have
00:57:07.84 --> 00:57:12.24 military professionals. And that's what they do. And it's also advantage as far as on concern that
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:18.48 we have reserveists that come and serve in Iraq, come and serve in an Afghanist and that go
00:57:18.48 --> 00:57:23.44 for the weekend and see how the military is doing and take their civilian expertise into the
00:57:24.08 --> 00:57:29.36 into the reserve unit or the national guard unit for the weekend. We have both those.
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:32.64 And there's advantages to both of those.
00:57:35.12 --> 00:57:39.60 Talking about that, I think it was the Guadalcanal reason podcast.
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:44.48 We're talking about how some of the reserveists, where the people that said, hey, that's a
00:57:44.48 --> 00:57:50.56 dumb idea. We don't want to do that. Because they hadn't been indoctrinated as fully as
00:57:51.20 --> 00:57:56.56 somebody that had been an infantry officer for 18 years and he's looking at the problem going,
00:57:56.56 --> 00:58:00.72 hey, I know how to solve this problem in the book. I know what to do. And some reserveists are like,
00:58:00.72 --> 00:58:08.32 hey, bro, I hunt and ten a sea. And that doesn't make any sense. So we use this as a competitive advantage.
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:16.000 I'm just thinking this whole time about the connection between these military examples.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.12 And I'm going through my head things that I remember as a Marine. And how closely
00:58:19.12 --> 00:58:26.48 connected they are to just everybody's life in both business and in life just the connections to
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:32.64 your family has you have long-range plans for your family. You have these strategic, long-range plans
00:58:32.64 --> 00:58:37.44 for your family. It's a really no different than I think they called the the enduring values of the
00:58:37.44 --> 00:58:45.04 country that you need to keep in mind that might actually change or influence the smaller things that you do.
00:58:45.04 --> 00:58:51.84 Yeah, and that's something I've been hitting on a lot. The fact that culture is the ultimate form
00:58:51.84 --> 00:58:56.24 of decentralized command. Culture is the ultimate form of decentralized command. Where now we have a
00:58:57.36 --> 00:59:01.44 a cashier that knows how to treat a client, a knows how to treat a customer because understands
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:06.56 the culture of the company. Now we have a Marine that can be out in town can see a situation unfolding
00:59:06.56 --> 00:59:11.44 and knows what decision to make it just based on the culture of the Marine Corps, of the seal teams,
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:17.52 of the army, of the 80 second airborne of the 101st airborne of the base. If you have that culture
00:59:17.52 --> 00:59:24.80 correct, that soldier, that Marine, that cashier, that frontline salesperson, they know what
00:59:24.80 --> 00:59:28.16 decision to make just based on the culture that you have inside the organization totally.
00:59:28.16 --> 00:59:33.92 And that's a two-way street too because if I'm running a grocery store and I've got a cashier,
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:37.60 I'm not going to spend all day every day just talking to that cashier about long-range strategic
00:59:37.60 --> 00:59:41.20 things for the company. I actually need that person up there, ringing up customers,
00:59:41.20 --> 00:59:47.52 as they're coming through. But if I, if I, as the CEO of that grocery chain or the CEO of that
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:54.32 company, don't think that that cashier can't make a strategic, a tattoo just in this massive
00:59:54.32 --> 00:59:58.64 strategic implications. And I lose side of the fact that they actually do, at certain intervals,
00:59:58.64 --> 01:00:03.28 need to understand how what they do affects the big picture. Then I'm actually sent myself up
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:07.52 for failure. Any Marine has ever been to Okuenawa, knows that when the Marine goes out and town
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:12.48 steals a car and runs into a fire hydrant, that Marine doesn't just get in trouble for sealant
01:00:12.48 --> 01:00:17.92 a car. That is an inter-national incident that undermines the relationship between two countries.
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:21.92 And it happens all the time. And if you don't think you're young folks that are doing this
01:00:21.92 --> 01:00:26.32 very tactical things, don't have to have some connection to the big picture enough to guide
01:00:27.04 --> 01:00:32.08 their day-to-day decisions. You are setting yourself up for long-term failure. And that works
01:00:32.08 --> 01:00:37.20 both ways. That cashier has to know, hey, I've got to treat this customer with some respect
01:00:37.20 --> 01:00:40.40 because if I don't, it's going to go on yellow, it's going to go on YouTube, it's going to go
01:00:40.40 --> 01:00:44.64 on Instagram or whatever that might be. And I could take down the whole company if I'm not careful.
01:00:45.28 --> 01:00:50.64 You know, I want to create paranoia, but they have to understand those small appearing to be small
01:00:50.64 --> 01:00:55.28 tattoo things can actually influence the entire organization. And they have to be able to make that
01:00:55.28 --> 01:01:04.64 connection. If you are in a situation like that and you're employing front line troops to carry out
01:01:04.64 --> 01:01:11.44 these sort of tactical day-to-day things, it's pretty easy to end up in the job market.
01:01:11.44 --> 01:01:16.40 The people that you're hiring, the human capital that you have available to you, it's pretty
01:01:16.40 --> 01:01:23.36 easy for them to be, hey, I actually, Dave C. E. O. Dave Burke, I actually don't really care about the
01:01:23.36 --> 01:01:28.96 company that much. And if you fire me tomorrow, I'll go get another minimum job, minimum wage
01:01:28.96 --> 01:01:32.000 jobs somewhere else and I don't really care. And so you sit here and tell me about how we can
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.08 have a strategic loss at your company because I don't treat a client right, whatever, right?
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:45.60 So what do you do then? And what do you have to do is you have to then explain two people
01:01:46.32 --> 01:01:54.56 that when that they have strategic goals in their life, that they need to have some kind of a
01:01:54.56 --> 01:02:00.32 path that they're going on. That hey, listen, listen echo Charles, I know you don't really care
01:02:00.32 --> 01:02:06.88 about work in here, that's fine. I get it. Listen, add a minimum. If you do a good job here,
01:02:06.88 --> 01:02:10.16 if you work here for six months, you work here for ten, 12 months, I don't know how long you're
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:15.28 in work for here for. When you leave, I can give you a recommendation that'll get you a better job
01:02:15.28 --> 01:02:20.80 somewhere. That'll put you on a better path. And that's all I want. Look, I know you don't necessarily
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:25.76 care about my company here. You don't like flipping burgers, I get it. But guess what?
01:02:25.76 --> 01:02:30.72 When you get done flipping burgers here, you can go get a job doing something that's a little
01:02:30.72 --> 01:02:36.88 bit better. So I don't, this isn't just about me and the company here, jockels burgers. Look,
01:02:36.88 --> 01:02:41.28 I'm going to be selling burgers for a long time. That's what I do. I love burgers. I know that
01:02:41.28 --> 01:02:46.56 this isn't your life goal. Guess what? What is your life goal? Where is it? Where are you at?
01:02:46.56 --> 01:02:50.48 Because I can promise you this. If you take care of me here, at some point, you're going to leave.
01:02:50.48 --> 01:02:55.20 I expect that. You got a lot of potential. When you leave here, I want to leave. I want you to leave
01:02:55.20 --> 01:03:00.24 on the best foot possible, set up for a long-term, better situation. I don't want you flipping
01:03:00.24 --> 01:03:05.92 burgers forever. But if you flip burgers well, that's the path to not flipping burgers, which is
01:03:05.92 --> 01:03:11.84 really interesting. One time I said, there was a person that talked about, uh, do I really need
01:03:11.84 --> 01:03:17.28 to learn GJ2 if I don't like to fight? And I said, that you actually should learn GJ2 more than
01:03:17.28 --> 01:03:23.52 anybody else if you don't like to fight. Echo, if you don't like flipping burgers, you more than
01:03:23.52 --> 01:03:27.28 anyone else should say, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to be the best burger
01:03:27.28 --> 01:03:34.96 flipper that I can be because that's going to allow me to step up into the next room because if you
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:40.000 can't flip burgers, bro, how can I expect you to do anything else? You're definitely not stepping
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.80 up to salad bar. And if you can't handle salad bar, you know, you're not going to be
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:49.68 day opener. Right? And if you can't be the day opener, you're not going to be the general manager.
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:51.84 If you're not the, well, if you're not going to be the storm manager, then the general manager,
01:03:51.84 --> 01:03:56.24 you see where this goes? And by the way, if you don't want to get in the restaurant business,
01:03:56.24 --> 01:04:02.56 that's fine too. When you go to work at a, at a mechanics shop, you want to be
01:04:02.56 --> 01:04:07.20 want to be an automotive mechanic. And that's where you want to go. What do I tell them when
01:04:07.20 --> 01:04:13.36 they call here to say, could Echo Charles flip burgers effectively and efficiently and reliably?
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:20.48 And I have to say, no, he couldn't, he was late on a regular basis. Or whatever, what if I say,
01:04:20.48 --> 01:04:27.04 hey, you know what, Echo's, hey, he was totally reliable, good to go, great attitude. Yeah, if you,
01:04:27.04 --> 01:04:33.12 if you look in a higher somebody that's going to be able to be a real bonus inside your organization,
01:04:33.68 --> 01:04:40.08 Echo Charles the guy, that's what I want to do for you. But you got at least, you got to do
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:44.48 something for me too. So if you're running it, if you're working with that, those those kind of
01:04:44.48 --> 01:04:51.12 entry level positions, sure, show them the strategic for the company for the business, but also show
01:04:51.12 --> 01:04:57.20 them strategically because, look, kids don't get that these days. I, but never mind, these days,
01:04:57.20 --> 01:05:02.16 I did, you know what, you know why I ended up doing okay in life is because I joined the navy.
01:05:02.16 --> 01:05:08.88 And they were like, do this and I said, Roger, wanted to be a good seal. Just that, that enough,
01:05:08.88 --> 01:05:14.96 that guidance, that, that goal was enough for me to like keep me out of trouble, keep me from being
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:19.60 at total idiot. I was a partial idiot plenty of times. Kept me out of being a total idiot.
01:05:20.88 --> 01:05:27.04 So when you have the opportunity to show somebody, show a younger person, hey, what you're doing
01:05:27.04 --> 01:05:31.04 right now is connected to the future. You might want to think about it. Here's what is your future.
01:05:31.04 --> 01:05:39.76 Oh, okay. Well, you want to be whatever you want to be. First step is flip and burgers. And that's
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:44.16 okay. Flip them good. Don't burn them. Keep them, keep them together.
01:05:48.96 --> 01:05:54.64 Note that these competitive advantages exist across the competition continuum and not only in the
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:59.52 time of war, we conduct exercises in part to demonstrate that United States has a military capability.
01:05:59.52 --> 01:06:06.56 It could use if necessary. The existence of these capabilities can impose costs on a potential
01:06:06.56 --> 01:06:13.84 rival because the rival may need to expand resources if they want to overcome or negate a US
01:06:13.84 --> 01:06:19.20 competitive advantage as the rival pursuits are close. So you're, you're making other people pay
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:27.20 another little, little plug for the Marine Corps. Hey, you got to have us. You got to have us,
01:06:27.20 --> 01:06:30.48 you got to have us well-training. You got to have us well prepared for battle because that makes
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:35.68 everyone else even poses a cost on everybody else, which is a positive thing. Record needs more exercises.
01:06:35.68 --> 01:06:42.32 Yes. When viewed from this perspective, we gain an insight of into how a military competitive
01:06:42.32 --> 01:06:48.96 advantage can help us compete with a rival. Also note that it needs to be a conscious decision on
01:06:48.96 --> 01:06:55.76 when and how to reveal our most sensitive competitive advantages. At a minimum, we should leverage
01:06:55.76 --> 01:07:01.92 such revelations for advantage in the information element of power. Other capabilities might be
01:07:01.92 --> 01:07:07.76 cloaked in secrecy and so they actually need to be used. So they're awesome. Don't just reveal
01:07:09.44 --> 01:07:15.52 the special move that you have to kick someone's ass. Yeah, man. We're celebrating, I think,
01:07:15.52 --> 01:07:20.80 at least I am. This is the anniversary of the kickoff of Desert Storm. I think it was,
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:25.84 well, when recorded, it's a couple of January 17th, 1991. That was the kickoff of Desert Storm.
01:07:25.84 --> 01:07:32.32 And I was kind of a kid wanting to be a pilot and the big reveal for us on that one that
01:07:32.32 --> 01:07:37.60 people don't understand is the stealth fighter. And all of a sudden, there's this big triple A in
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:43.60 anti-aircraft system and it's going to be the Roomba Moserobus air defense system ever. And night zero,
01:07:43.60 --> 01:07:47.60 you know, in Iraq and all of a sudden things just are blowing up and Baghdad and nobody has any
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:51.76 idea why they're just sitting there watching things blow up. There's nothing on radar. There's
01:07:51.76 --> 01:07:55.52 nothing out there as far as they know except they can hear airplanes flying overhead because the
01:07:55.52 --> 01:07:59.52 jet engines are making sound and then things are just blowing up. And we're basically told the
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:05.92 world, oh, by the way, we hated to have to do this. But if you're wondering, this is what we can do.
01:08:05.92 --> 01:08:12.56 You might want to, and that's 30 years ago, our competitors are just just now, think the amount of
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:16.80 time and money invested in them trying to build stealth technology, which has been a huge race
01:08:16.80 --> 01:08:22.64 in a big competition. We showed that to the world on day zero of the war. And as a pilot, obviously,
01:08:22.64 --> 01:08:25.68 we think about that too, as the competitive advantage makes other people go, well,
01:08:27.20 --> 01:08:30.80 maybe it's just not worth going to war with them. Maybe this just isn't worth it. Maybe this
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:33.68 investment we're making is not worth it because they outcome, they can do things we need to
01:08:33.68 --> 01:08:40.24 know exist. So the revelation of that when carefully placed in time, well, can, can be a huge
01:08:40.24 --> 01:08:44.32 advantage. Yeah, not to mention they had no time to adapt to it because if we were to told them,
01:08:44.32 --> 01:08:47.84 they would have figured out some methodology or I'll tell you some attempt to figure out a more
01:08:47.84 --> 01:08:53.44 accurate radar or some kind of a defense system that could spot these aircraft overhead. Yeah,
01:08:53.44 --> 01:09:00.80 that's a great example of how you do it. It happens in GJ2, like if you have that move that you're
01:09:00.80 --> 01:09:06.56 pretty good at and you go for it, it's not a surprise anymore. I'm not saying you're not going to
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:12.08 get it, but it's not a surprise. And now the person's expecting it to come. So you want if you're going
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:16.72 to do it, might want to hang on to it just for, you know, a little bit deeper into that role,
01:09:16.72 --> 01:09:27.92 let that person be breathin' hard, let the O2 start to lack. All types of competitive advantages
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:33.60 can atrophy, however, they all need appropriate practice exercising and improving if they are to remain
01:09:33.60 --> 01:09:39.28 advantages in the dynamic environment of international competition. Just so you can't, you can't rest
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:47.36 on your laurels, ever. You can't rest on your laurels, ever. Competitors as systems, competitors are
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:55.84 complex, adaptive systems. Again, this, this, this, competitors are complex, adaptive systems. I guess
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:01.44 we kind of need to say it, right? We need to make it clear. And then, but it does make it even more
01:10:01.44 --> 01:10:05.52 clear, meaning they have many parts and these parts interact with each other in non-linear,
01:10:05.52 --> 01:10:10.80 often unpredictable ways. Consider Iran's national security decision-making structure. To some
01:10:10.80 --> 01:10:17.04 outside observers, they may appear to function as a strictly hierarchical organization with all
01:10:17.04 --> 01:10:20.96 important decisions being made by the Supreme Leader and President at the top of the pyramid,
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:25.44 however, the rest story is much more complex. Much of the Supreme Leader's authority comes from
01:10:25.44 --> 01:10:30.80 informal relationships. He has with top commanders in the national security infrastructure
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:35.92 and through the presence of his clerical representatives in military organizations. Even though
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:40.08 the president is the chairman of the Supreme Council for national security, his power,
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:45.12 EBS and flows because the Supreme Leader is the commander in chief and may bypass the president
01:10:45.12 --> 01:10:56.56 through his informal relationships. So, even in that, like they said, very strict, what one appears to
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:03.12 be a strict hierarchy? It's all over the place. Guess what's more important? Relationships. Relationships
01:11:03.12 --> 01:11:08.88 are more important than the chain of command, even in an auto-cratic country like Iran.
01:11:12.08 --> 01:11:16.40 The military structure itself can act in under-predictable ways, especially the Islamic Revolutionary
01:11:16.40 --> 01:11:21.84 Guards. They've developed significant and separate political power based on its financial
01:11:21.84 --> 01:11:27.04 resources because it controls many businesses in almost every sector of the Iranian economy.
01:11:27.04 --> 01:11:30.64 Each of these power centers, among others, Jockey's for power inside Iran,
01:11:30.64 --> 01:11:37.52 working to advance their own internal or domestic interests. So, it's complicated.
01:11:39.12 --> 01:11:44.08 It's complicated. And you know what's crazy when you see videos, you ever seen videos in
01:11:44.08 --> 01:11:53.20 our pictures in Iran in like 19, whatever, 1973. It's totally westernized. It looks just like everything's
01:11:53.20 --> 01:12:02.80 good to go. Skip and forward a little bit, developing a model of how a competitor system fits
01:12:02.80 --> 01:12:07.60 together helps identify their competitive strengths, weaknesses, at a basic level, each of these
01:12:07.60 --> 01:12:15.04 systems consists of people, ideas, and things. The people make the system work. They also
01:12:15.04 --> 01:12:20.72 analyze its performance over time because they are also responsible for sustaining or improving
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:27.60 the systems competitive advantages. The ideas of the system are found in the goals it pursues
01:12:27.60 --> 01:12:36.08 and in concepts it processes it uses to operate in the world. Mow famously stated politics
01:12:36.08 --> 01:12:41.12 is a war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed. This quote suggests a mindset
01:12:41.12 --> 01:12:48.48 that blurs the lines between peace and war. The mindset, this idea creates may give a competitor
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:55.20 and advantage in operating near the threshold of violence. So, that statement from Mow is sort of
01:12:55.20 --> 01:12:59.52 the same thing that this whole, there's a continuum, right? You got politics, which is just war
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:03.36 without blood. And then at some point you turn it into war. Now we got politics with bloodshed.
01:13:03.36 --> 01:13:09.20 But I'm going to dig into this one a little bit. Ideally, there are things then added or
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:13.36 created to support the people and the ideas within the system. So we're talking about people,
01:13:13.36 --> 01:13:22.24 ideas, and things. With this in mind, within the system helping it achieve its goals.
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:27.28 With this in mind, we can look at a competitor system and create a model of how it fits together,
01:13:27.28 --> 01:13:34.16 where it is strong, and where it is vulnerable. Finally, after creating this model, Marines must remain
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:40.72 disciplined in its use. Models are useful, but in perfect, they are theories about the systemic
01:13:40.72 --> 01:13:45.20 structure of our rival. We need to remain alert for opportunities to improve our models
01:13:46.08 --> 01:13:52.72 as we learn more about how our competitors operate in the real world. Now this is the thing that
01:13:52.72 --> 01:14:00.88 so they talk about the simple people, ideas, and things. That's sort of what a competitor system is.
01:14:01.52 --> 01:14:07.20 And I added, well, this is up for debate, but I'll throw it out there for you. People,
01:14:07.20 --> 01:14:13.44 ideas, and things. That's sort of what you judge how your competitors are going to operate.
01:14:14.72 --> 01:14:18.96 I think perhaps there is possibly one more that needs to be added.
01:14:18.96 --> 01:14:26.72 And it may be covered by people, and it may be covered by ideas, and it not things, but a little bit.
01:14:26.72 --> 01:14:35.12 That is the idea of execution or taking action. So you can have people, you can have ideas,
01:14:35.12 --> 01:14:44.48 and you can have things. But if you can't execute, then you're dead in the water. Now,
01:14:44.48 --> 01:14:50.48 you could say that it's people that need to make things execute. So, okay, I get that. But I just
01:14:50.48 --> 01:14:59.04 felt the need to kind of call that out because when I look at a competitor, I think about,
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:03.84 yes, they got these people. Yes, they got their, they got this team. They've got these ideas. Okay,
01:15:03.84 --> 01:15:09.28 I get, they've got some competitive advantages there, or disadvantages. And they've got things. They got
01:15:09.28 --> 01:15:16.72 them, they've got things. But all three of those things without execution, to me, I'm not even worried
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:23.12 about you. I'm not even worried about you. If you can't execute. So, I don't know. Am I, am I
01:15:23.76 --> 01:15:29.36 reaching to you? Am I not giving enough credit to people? Possibly? Yeah, I mean, I guess that you
01:15:29.36 --> 01:15:34.56 could dig into deeper on what they mean by that. But when you said it, the first thing that went into
01:15:34.56 --> 01:15:40.64 my mind works in the opposite direction, too, is that they might not have the best, well, most well-trained
01:15:40.64 --> 01:15:45.28 people. And maybe their tools are kind of outdated and their systems aren't so great because they're
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:49.92 antiquated and maybe they don't have big budgets. But if these people have been executing and what
01:15:49.92 --> 01:15:53.68 with brought me to is how many times you've said on this podcast is who we were fighting in Iraq,
01:15:54.56 --> 01:15:59.92 who we were fighting against al-Qaeda. They're things, they're things were garbage. On paper,
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:06.08 compared to ours, garbage. They were rusty. They were old. And there are people, and I don't mean
01:16:06.08 --> 01:16:09.44 it like there are people like something wrong with their people, but they didn't have the training
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:12.80 we had. They didn't have the resources. They had their people weren't invested in in the way that we
01:16:12.80 --> 01:16:18.40 invested in our people. But you know what they had been doing? They'd been executing for a really
01:16:18.40 --> 01:16:23.60 long time. So that piece, and maybe somebody could say, well, that's what people is and
01:16:23.60 --> 01:16:29.44 might be missing that. But I'm thinking of people like, I know what American marines and soldiers,
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:33.84 I know what those people are. And it's really easy to look across and go, those people, those people,
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:40.64 and just dismiss what they are. But those people had been executing and they were really good as a result.
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:45.92 And offset where we thought we had this big advantage. Look at our gear. Look at our training. On paper,
01:16:46.80 --> 01:16:51.20 it should have been a one side of the fair. If you measured it with those things and what they weren't
01:16:51.20 --> 01:16:56.88 measuring was the value of the, I think what you're saying is the execution. Yeah, and even
01:16:56.88 --> 01:17:01.20 what you just said, like, if you take a group of marines or you take a group of soldiers,
01:17:03.60 --> 01:17:08.64 and they have training and it's all good. But if they don't execute and you could say, well,
01:17:08.64 --> 01:17:14.32 a marine is going to execute. We know that's actually not true. It's a good ideal. We could say
01:17:14.32 --> 01:17:18.48 a soldier is going to soldier with a, with a, with a platoon leader is going to execute.
01:17:19.28 --> 01:17:25.12 Not necessarily true. Not only, yeah. So to me, it's almost like a four thing that does make
01:17:25.12 --> 01:17:30.48 sense in there. Yeah. I actually thought that the third one was going to be the execution.
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:38.000 People things and people people ideas ideas and execution. Yeah. That what, so it's almost like
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.16 and listening to you guys and you said a good thing. You said, um, Dave, sit on paper.
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:46.32 Because like that's kind of really what that whole thing kind of seems like it is because,
01:17:46.32 --> 01:17:54.32 okay, so you got people ideas and things. But people and ideas is, it's almost like people is what
01:17:54.32 --> 01:18:01.84 you can do and then execution is what you will do. So the, so again, on paper, where you have this
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:07.60 capability, you have this many people with this capability with these tools and what they can do with
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:12.56 these tools and then, but then just like I said, it doesn't mean that they're going to do. Yeah.
01:18:12.56 --> 01:18:18.16 Yeah. You know, like just, you guys say default aggressive. It's like that's that, that third kind of
01:18:18.16 --> 01:18:24.72 thing that you have to implement to create this execution. You ever seen an MMA fight that was about
01:18:24.72 --> 01:18:32.40 to happen and on paper, the got fighter A should destroy fighter B and what, what is the problem
01:18:32.40 --> 01:18:37.84 when he loses? Yeah. The problem is he doesn't execute. Yeah. The, the good and not to go too deep into
01:18:37.84 --> 01:18:41.44 the MMA thing. So remember certain, uh, cowboy, surrounding the animal, the animal, the animal,
01:18:41.44 --> 01:18:48.16 connamo-grigger, right? So you, like, Soroni is an executor guy. He executes, he executes, but then Connor is
01:18:48.16 --> 01:18:53.92 like a cerebral guy, like he'll play up stuff before the fight as well to kind of create that, that third
01:18:53.92 --> 01:18:59.84 man in the ring. And that third man in the ring, in this case, was to get in the way of execution.
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:05.76 And there's like a video on it to that theorize this where connamo-grigger was usually he's talking
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:11.44 trash to the guy telling them basically how much like junker of a fighter than he then he is or whatever,
01:19:11.44 --> 01:19:15.92 but it was the opposite this time. It was like he was saying, oh man, I respect him and it was friendly.
01:19:15.92 --> 01:19:23.68 He was really friendly actually. So it theoretically created this mindset on Donald Soroni's in his mind.
01:19:23.68 --> 01:19:29.12 Yeah. That's like all of that. And it kind of took away from his execution instinct, you know.
01:19:29.12 --> 01:19:34.64 So he was like, oh, it's like, oh, it's not as we're kind of frozen away. You know, it's like super
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:40.32 respectful fight. And then you see Connor how he came out in the fight all crazy. And it's almost like
01:19:40.32 --> 01:19:46.16 he almost, you know, weird way surprised him, which how hard he was executing on a guy who usually
01:19:46.16 --> 01:19:52.08 executes, but that element didn't seem to be there as much, you know. So it's like man, that execution
01:19:52.08 --> 01:20:01.20 part of it, but that's a huge deal. Yeah. And just props to Calboy, props to Connor. Calboy,
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:08.88 dude, he, he's got some scorer. And he does eight million other things.
01:20:13.12 --> 01:20:19.60 I wrote something down as you were getting to those, you know, connecting those two paragraphs.
01:20:19.60 --> 01:20:24.48 And it's, it's really interesting to hear the conversations that you just had and that adding
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:29.84 that additional piece, I wrote down in my margin here, you don't know. And so this model,
01:20:29.84 --> 01:20:34.32 this thing, this we create and and the military does this all that we make create models for
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:37.68 everything. And we're like, hey, I'm going to run a thousand simulations against my machine and
01:20:37.68 --> 01:20:43.28 that we do models for everything. We create this. And it was saying, hey, don't rely on that model.
01:20:43.28 --> 01:20:49.12 That's even more evidence. The, the, you don't know, we can create a model that can be useful
01:20:49.12 --> 01:20:52.16 for what, competitions can be like what we think the economies are going to look like. And we
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:56.56 can look at history. We can create a whole bunch of things that help us make decisions. But at the end of
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:04.24 all that you don't know, you don't know. And so if you don't know how useful is it getting back
01:21:04.24 --> 01:21:08.96 to the first thing is how useful is it to dig in on your way of doing? If you really don't know,
01:21:08.96 --> 01:21:13.28 and that's really what this is saying. Even, I could say, Jockel, I've run the numbers. I've done
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:17.60 this analysis. I've compared to these last three, a row, I should say, if I could give you a thousand
01:21:17.60 --> 01:21:23.12 reasons why this is the answer. And at the end, I should say, but I still don't know, because you
01:21:23.12 --> 01:21:27.84 don't know. And that's really part of what this is saying to. And the piece in there, when you
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:34.16 talk about the implementation, that's where the execution, where it's all going to happen. So not knowing
01:21:34.16 --> 01:21:38.96 and acknowledging you don't know is also a really powerful thing. And you're building this
01:21:38.96 --> 01:21:43.68 framework in your mind of how things are going to be. Yeah. It also, that introduces the idea of
01:21:45.04 --> 01:21:52.24 I know what you think is going to happen. And I'm not going to allow that to occur, which is,
01:21:52.24 --> 01:21:57.36 you know, what game you think, if I can convince you that all right, Dave, you and I are going
01:21:57.36 --> 01:22:04.56 to stand up. And you see this is like the the the most lame example, but you know, some of
01:22:04.56 --> 01:22:09.36 it's like, oh, you know, some wrestler that's like, no way, I'm going to, I'm going to knock him out. I'm
01:22:09.36 --> 01:22:12.56 going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. And he's trying to convince
01:22:12.56 --> 01:22:15.76 the other person that like we're going to stand in fights. You don't have to worry about your ground
01:22:15.76 --> 01:22:20.56 game or whatever. And then he goes out and takes him down and does what he's going to do. It's
01:22:20.56 --> 01:22:27.52 this, what game are you going to play? Like, I'm going to get you out of your game. That's what I'm
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:33.04 going to do. Take away your competitive. Yeah, actually, Jeremy Stevens against Petus Anthony Petus.
01:22:33.92 --> 01:22:41.04 And you know, Anthony Petus is a striker primarily. And I was cornering Jeremy on that fight.
01:22:41.04 --> 01:22:50.24 And Jeremy's got, you know, fists of lead. And he knocks people out. And he he might not be the
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:54.40 most technical striker. I'm not saying he's not technically not. I would say he's not as technical
01:22:54.40 --> 01:23:01.04 as Anthony Petus was at that time. And so we're going into the fight. Jeremy definitely going
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:06.000 into the fight thinking, hey, it's been no cool. I'm going to stand up. I know I can take a punch.
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.12 And I'm going to connect at some point with Petus's chin. And I'm going to win. What did Petus do?
01:23:11.12 --> 01:23:17.12 Came out, took him down. And it was a surprise. It's surprised to me. It's a surprise to Jeremy.
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:22.88 And that's the way it went. But he changed. He did what we didn't expect him to do, which is just
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:26.80 a brilliant move, right? So all the things that you think you know,
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:33.60 done happen had another fighter was like, hey, aren't you going to work ground game? And he's like,
01:23:33.60 --> 01:23:37.76 I can't, I'm not going to get taken down by this guy. And I said, man, you better at least,
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:42.96 you know, work to get off your back. I'm not going to get taken down. He's not good enough
01:23:42.96 --> 01:23:48.000 of a wrestler to take me down. He's a striker. Okay. Cool. What happened? This, this is after the
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.44 lessons learned, right? The lessons learned from Jeremy is, you better be ready for whatever,
01:23:51.44 --> 01:23:57.12 you better train to fight. Because you can't predict what the, what you're saying Dave,
01:23:57.12 --> 01:24:01.04 I can't predict what the enemy is going to do. Can't predict it. I don't know what the enemy's
01:24:01.04 --> 01:24:05.52 going to do. I might think one thing, but I can't, that doesn't mean I can blow off every other
01:24:05.52 --> 01:24:11.52 possibility at all. What I need to do is be prepared too fight. You know, the closest thing that they
01:24:11.52 --> 01:24:18.96 say in this is a performance, they kind of, I'm trying, I like Doug Fetus, like, where are my missing,
01:24:18.96 --> 01:24:21.76 it maybe they are talking about execution numbers, don't see it? Like the closest I think they
01:24:21.76 --> 01:24:28.16 have is they say analyze, you know, the, the opponents performance over time. So your sort of talking
01:24:28.16 --> 01:24:34.72 about execution maybe he doesn't really do it, but I think maybe an additional item to assess
01:24:34.72 --> 01:24:44.48 your opponent is necessary. And that is people, ideas, things, and execution. We also look at
01:24:44.48 --> 01:24:49.52 our own system to increase our competitive advantages or create new ones. For example,
01:24:50.96 --> 01:24:55.04 do the people in our system have their necessary skills and aptitudes required to sustain
01:24:55.04 --> 01:25:00.32 our competitive advantages. Do they have the skills to build new ones? At a national level,
01:25:00.32 --> 01:25:05.68 does the target population for our recruiting efforts have the right education in a similar way?
01:25:05.68 --> 01:25:11.28 Can we look at our ideas? Do our operating concepts give us an advantage? And things do,
01:25:11.28 --> 01:25:16.40 does any of our equipment provide over match to evaluate our competitive system system? Again,
01:25:17.20 --> 01:25:21.04 to me, we can check the, we can check the ideas, we can check the things, we can check the people.
01:25:21.04 --> 01:25:26.08 I better check the execution because none of this stuff matters without execution.
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.04 It's not always true that the organization with a new,
01:25:33.04 --> 01:25:38.80 istermost equipment wins the competition, quote Dave Burke. Sometimes aside, it is able to combine
01:25:38.80 --> 01:25:43.92 adequate material with innovative new ideas becomes the winner from this analysis. We can then
01:25:43.92 --> 01:25:47.20 increase our existing advantages or create new ones as deemed necessary.
01:25:47.20 --> 01:25:55.04 Means in competition. As similarly described, we're fighting the highest level of competition
01:25:55.04 --> 01:25:59.44 involves the use of all the elements of power. Marines are primarily concerned with the military
01:25:59.44 --> 01:26:04.40 aspects of competition, but we must not consider it an isolation from the other elements of
01:26:04.40 --> 01:26:10.88 national power. War fighting states, quote, the use of military force may take any number of
01:26:10.88 --> 01:26:16.08 forms from the mere deployment of forces as a demonstration of resolve to the enforcement of a
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:20.56 negotiated truth, truth to general warfare with sophisticated weaponry.
01:26:22.56 --> 01:26:26.56 And, quote, here we see the alignment between our war fighting and competition doctrines start to
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:32.48 immerse. So the whole point of this thing. In war, we impose our will on our adversary.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000 Their cooperation is not required. Going back into influence and leadership, right?
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.44 In competition, we make use of military force to attract or coerce.
01:26:47.52 --> 01:26:51.60 When using attraction, we use incentives, talking earlier about the carrot. We use incentives
01:26:51.60 --> 01:26:57.52 to induce arrival or other political actor to adopt a position favorable to us or otherwise allow
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:05.76 us to reach our goals. And you know what? Sometimes we're going to talk about leadership,
01:27:05.76 --> 01:27:11.44 I talk about efficiency. And sometimes people think the most efficient thing for me to do is say,
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:15.92 Dave, you need to use this route to get to the target. And people think that's the most of it.
01:27:15.92 --> 01:27:21.12 Hey, and it's really hard to see past that. Because clearly, if I have to say,
01:27:21.84 --> 01:27:24.40 you know, hey, Dave, well, how do you want to do it? And we have to have a discussion about it.
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:28.32 It takes us another seven minutes before I finally comply with actually what you want to do.
01:27:29.20 --> 01:27:31.04 And that seems a lot less efficient. Yeah.
01:27:31.04 --> 01:27:38.96 But the efficiency comes out 10 fold in the field and in the execution. Let's think about the execution.
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:46.08 It's because as a leader, you have to recognize that what you're doing is not getting
01:27:46.80 --> 01:27:51.04 to point eight a point to be in this patrol. That's not what the actual goal is. That might be
01:27:51.04 --> 01:27:53.44 this little mission. There's a little plack about what you're trying to do is create a leader.
01:27:53.44 --> 01:27:57.12 That at some point can go fight a war for you independently without you being there in a way that
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.28 reinforce it. So it's this recognition that's not that's not even what you're trying to do.
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:08.72 And it's that it's that mirage of this is the best way to get it done. I get your face to tell you
01:28:08.72 --> 01:28:15.04 what to do and look what happened. He did it mission accomplished. That is only true if the only thing
01:28:15.04 --> 01:28:19.52 you're actually doing is getting from point eight to point B, which simply is not what you're doing.
01:28:19.52 --> 01:28:24.000 That's not what you're doing. That's zero percent of the time. Zero. It's not what you're doing.
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:31.36 When using coercion, we can pedal arrival to take an action in our favor or to stop taking
01:28:31.36 --> 01:28:35.20 an action that's not in our favor or we make use of military force to deter arrival from taking
01:28:35.20 --> 01:28:41.12 action in the first place. For both compelants and deterrence, our goal is to use the threat of
01:28:41.12 --> 01:28:46.56 military force to achieve our desired outcome. For this to be the case, our competitive advantage
01:28:46.56 --> 01:28:51.12 must be clear enough to our rival that it affects the decisions they make. What's interesting about
01:28:51.12 --> 01:29:01.12 this is when I'm your boss Dave, I have to remember that when I'm talking to you, there is
01:29:01.12 --> 01:29:07.12 the threat of me being able to fire you. I might not even say a word about it. So I have to kind of
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:14.64 consciously mitigate that threat so that you will push back against me so that you will understand
01:29:14.64 --> 01:29:20.56 that I'm open to your ideas. I have to consciously do that. So I'm not just compliant. Just yeah,
01:29:20.56 --> 01:29:25.44 because that threat's there. And sometimes we work with companies where people are just scarred.
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:29.52 No one will say anything back to the boss because the last boss with tyrannical idiot that
01:29:29.52 --> 01:29:33.52 barked everyone and told them what to do and fired half the organization and everyone was
01:29:33.52 --> 01:29:38.24 scared all the time to make a move. And that's why, by the way, that's why we show up there because
01:29:38.24 --> 01:29:41.52 the business is failing because there's total centralized community doesn't work.
01:29:46.16 --> 01:29:49.36 So you've got to use the threat of military force for this to be the case. Our competitive
01:29:49.36 --> 01:29:54.24 advantage must be clear enough for a rival to that it affects their decisions. Note that a competitive
01:29:54.24 --> 01:29:58.48 advantage does not necessarily equal military superiority, a competitive strength of will,
01:29:59.28 --> 01:30:03.68 along with non-military tools of policy are part of the equation too.
01:30:05.68 --> 01:30:10.32 Attraction, political actors often use various forms of attraction to achieve their goals,
01:30:10.32 --> 01:30:15.20 to attract someone to attract someone as to induce entice or persuade someone into doing something.
01:30:15.20 --> 01:30:21.28 And an negotiation is a reward or incentive for someone to make a choice that is favorable to us.
01:30:21.28 --> 01:30:26.56 We can say that then that attraction is the counterpoint to coercion instead of using pressure
01:30:26.56 --> 01:30:31.20 to help our goals, we use some type of reward instead. Okay, carrot, stick. That's what we're talking
01:30:31.20 --> 01:30:37.28 about. Marines participate in attraction strategies all the time demonstrating our professional
01:30:37.28 --> 01:30:42.48 commitment to our national values when conducting bilateral training. And recent years, for example,
01:30:42.48 --> 01:30:48.80 as part of US larger US attraction strategy, Marine provided training on amphibious operations
01:30:48.80 --> 01:30:53.36 to an important ally to Pan. Check. That's what that's what the Marines are doing all the time.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.20 That's what the entire military is doing all the time. That's what we need to
01:31:00.24 --> 01:31:06.88 continue to do. We get into coercion fast forward a little bit. Political actors often use
01:31:06.88 --> 01:31:12.48 coercion as a way to achieve their goals. To coerc someone as to pressure intimidate or force
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:17.20 someone into doing something or to reach one goals through the use of pressure threat or force.
01:31:19.44 --> 01:31:22.80 There's a big difference in jujitsu between attraction and coercion.
01:31:22.80 --> 01:31:28.48 Right, attraction is like you get someone to defend their neck so that you can take their on.
01:31:29.92 --> 01:31:35.44 You can also force them to put themselves in a certain position. I guess that one's a little
01:31:35.44 --> 01:31:39.04 bit of a bad example because you kind of have to defend your neck. So you're coercing them to get
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.52 those hands in position. It does this by influencing an adversary as a will or incentive structure.
01:31:45.52 --> 01:31:50.64 It is a strategy that often combines the threat of force. And if necessary, the limited controlled
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.28 use of force with positive inducements, coercion as two forms, compelence and deterrence,
01:31:55.28 --> 01:32:00.64 compelence is a threat intended to make an adversary do something to take a specific action.
01:32:00.64 --> 01:32:06.24 And deterrence is a threat intended to inhibit an adversary from taking a particular action
01:32:06.24 --> 01:32:12.48 to prevent it from even getting started. In both cases, the target of coercion must be
01:32:13.04 --> 01:32:18.56 cooperate, must cooperate because the target must decide to comply with the goal of an actor
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:24.64 who is applying the coercion. This cooperation is not friendly or willing but still must
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:31.68 exist for coercion to be effective. Not friendly, not willing. So just to be clear, so the coercion
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:38.000 positive and negative or the coercion, like, okay, I'm going to force this guy or intimidate
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.28 this person to do something versus not versus, but then additionally the other coercion method
01:32:47.28 --> 01:32:54.72 is to intimidate them to not do something. Yes, either compeling them to do something or
01:32:54.72 --> 01:32:59.12 you're deterring them from doing something but you kind of have to participate in it.
01:32:59.12 --> 01:33:04.000 Right, like you got to quite like, you know, I don't know, this security guard or something. Like,
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.12 hey, don't tell an aster don't whatever because we're going to go in this back door to rob the
01:33:09.12 --> 01:33:13.92 bank or whatever, you know, right? Like so if I'm a bank robber, I want to go rob the bank.
01:33:13.92 --> 01:33:19.84 Hmm, I know the security guard. I'm going to say, hey, I'm going to rob your bank. Don't stop us.
01:33:19.84 --> 01:33:22.88 Or else we're going to kill you with it. Okay, yes, that's coercion. Yeah,
01:33:22.88 --> 01:33:28.56 front to force him to not do something. Right, but he, but the point here is that he has to
01:33:28.56 --> 01:33:33.20 he has to be willing to do it. Right, right, right, you're not just for you could, you could take his
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:38.40 head up where he can't even talk or move. Now, it doesn't matter where he's willing or not, he's not doing it.
01:33:38.40 --> 01:33:42.000 Right, but I'm saying, like, let's say the ability before the bank robbery, it's like when in the
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.08 planning process, you know, maybe the bank robber, but the security guard is my neighbor or something.
01:33:48.08 --> 01:33:51.60 And then I'm going to be like, hey, we're going to rob the bank on your shift.
01:33:51.60 --> 01:33:56.24 Hmm, if so you can't call the cops, you know, you can't sound the alarm or whatever.
01:33:56.24 --> 01:34:00.16 Or kill you or kill you or whatever. It's coercion. Yeah, yeah. It's also a bad plan.
01:34:01.04 --> 01:34:05.52 Yeah, I would think so. But now he's going to tell on everybody before it happens.
01:34:06.72 --> 01:34:11.36 Not if I coerism correctly, you seem to say you better have like his child and the
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:14.08 chunk of your car forever.
01:34:15.36 --> 01:34:20.64 See, it's not that bad. Yeah, you're right. You're right. The idea of using coercion in a competition can be
01:34:20.64 --> 01:34:26.48 misleading if we do not identify the assumptions that support its use. It's often assumed that a
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:32.40 stronger nation can naturally coerce a weaker one into doing what it wants. However, this assumption may
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:37.76 not be true if the weaker nation is willing to absorb or but more punishment than the stronger one
01:34:37.76 --> 01:34:43.52 can or will deliver or stay committed to its goals over a longer period of time. This is
01:34:44.48 --> 01:34:51.84 one of the things that we always have to think about this is in the Vietnam War when we try to say,
01:34:51.84 --> 01:34:57.76 you know what, we can kill 150 of them for every one of us that they kill and we said,
01:34:57.76 --> 01:35:04.72 that's a win. How do we lose that? How to say how you lose it? Those 150 mean less to the
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:08.80 communist government than the one does to the American people in the American government.
01:35:08.80 --> 01:35:13.68 Yeah. When your model places the same value on people for your enemy as it does for yourself
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:17.84 and go, we've run that nobody would tolerate this. We would never tolerate this loss.
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:22.64 Well, they will. And I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking of when the Soviet Union
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:29.04 innovative Afghanistan. And again, how lopsided that appeared, but in terms of the interest in what
01:35:29.04 --> 01:35:32.48 they were willing to endure and how long they were willing to endure. And sooner or later, it's like,
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:36.40 hey, we can't do this anymore. We're done here. We're done here.
01:35:38.24 --> 01:35:44.08 It says the next week, we call this asymmetry of interest. In this case, the weaker nation has
01:35:44.08 --> 01:35:48.16 the more powerful desire to achieve its interest in the stronger nation. This is, you have to watch
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:53.28 out for this. So you have to watch out for that from as a leader when you're working with a subordinate
01:35:54.40 --> 01:36:01.92 and you start to escalate through the continuum of influence. And you don't recognize that maybe
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:06.96 they don't care if they get fired. And all you think, you know, you want more word out of you
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:14.64 and you're going to get fired. And they don't care. The example as a parent with kids
01:36:14.64 --> 01:36:19.44 probably resonates with a lot of folks. Because as you know, certainly as your kids get older,
01:36:19.44 --> 01:36:25.12 that threat of violence becomes so much less useful. Like, hey, if you do this, I'm going to
01:36:25.12 --> 01:36:29.28 I'm going to ground you. Like, okay, I'll just sneak out of a few sneak out. I'm going to take
01:36:29.28 --> 01:36:35.52 a car away. Cool. And the willingness for them to just outlast you on principle alone or the
01:36:35.52 --> 01:36:39.68 willingness to endure whatever you are going to impose on them, you have to calculate in your mind.
01:36:39.68 --> 01:36:46.96 What they're willing to endure. So you want to hear about some of this calculation? So my, uh,
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:54.08 my son had gotten a little out of line. This is when he was young. And he was in a very
01:36:54.08 --> 01:37:02.56 austere, I put him into a very austere environment to get him to coerced to understand what
01:37:02.56 --> 01:37:10.16 he had done wrong and how we don't do this kind of thing. And it was really strict. And it's
01:37:10.16 --> 01:37:14.88 not by the way, it's no fun for you for the parent, right? We don't want to be strict. We want to
01:37:14.88 --> 01:37:19.04 like have fun and it's all good and we want to buy toys and we want to just, but you, but when you
01:37:19.04 --> 01:37:26.16 go austere, then you're not doing any of that and it's not fun. So over time, as, you know, he,
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:33.36 he was straightening out and he's probably like seven. And eventually, you know, he had gotten,
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:38.48 you know, some toys back and then he had gotten, you know, his, he could use a pillow again and his
01:37:38.48 --> 01:37:46.48 bedroom and, uh, you know, those kind of creature comforts start to come back and then, you know,
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:53.12 two, three months later, I, you know, something's little spark of like, wait a second.
01:37:54.56 --> 01:38:00.96 And, and what I called this, because he was young, I called this, uh, you know, I have to be strict
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:05.36 with you. So then I started being less and less strict. He started getting some of these privileges back
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:11.36 and then one time he started stepping online a little bit and I said, hey, am, am I going to have to
01:38:11.36 --> 01:38:19.36 get strict with you again? And he said something along the lines of like, I think maybe you should,
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:28.32 so that I can be tougher. I always like, go, I was like, I did not, I was, I didn't want to be
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:32.64 strict with. I want to, like, let's go back to party time. Yeah, let's go back to, we can, you know,
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:37.92 play with toys and have a good, he says, maybe, maybe you should, so I can be tougher and I was
01:38:37.92 --> 01:38:44.24 damn it. He just won the test of wheels you want. Like, you can take, go ahead, you should,
01:38:44.24 --> 01:38:50.56 actually, actually, we're one level deeper, like you should. It's in my best interest for you to do that.
01:38:50.56 --> 01:38:55.76 Let's do it immediately. So you got to, you got to pay attention to kids or come at you.
01:38:55.76 --> 01:39:01.92 I'll come at you. Psychological warfare. Information,
01:39:01.92 --> 01:39:09.84 information plays a special role in competition. Narratives play an important part because they are
01:39:09.84 --> 01:39:15.04 what gives meaning to a set of facts. For example, to come, but two competitors may both as
01:39:15.04 --> 01:39:19.84 are to possess a particular island. One of them may have a narrative that explains their claim to
01:39:19.84 --> 01:39:23.92 the island on the basis of historical ownership. The other may have a narrative that says some
01:39:23.92 --> 01:39:28.32 of the people that currently use the island and current possession makes their claim stronger.
01:39:28.32 --> 01:39:34.32 Two narratives compete with each other to give facts and meanings. I got a good question on EF online
01:39:34.32 --> 01:39:39.28 the other day. I think it was EF on the might of an client, but it was along the lines of, hey,
01:39:39.60 --> 01:39:44.000 how do we develop this culture? And my answer was, you need to tell the story of what's going on
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.68 in it. And when we talked about on the spotcast, the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps tells the story,
01:39:49.68 --> 01:39:54.80 yeah, that's how it's going off from the last podcast about about the squad leader makes a difference.
01:39:54.80 --> 01:40:00.64 That thing is primed and ready to rock and roll on the podcast. So the narrative that you tell
01:40:00.64 --> 01:40:07.92 the information that you put out there was just so important. Demonstrating a capability
01:40:07.92 --> 01:40:13.04 and exercise and then think and then communicating so that it affects a competitor's thinking
01:40:14.32 --> 01:40:19.52 is another way Marines use information. Leaders determine what capabilities to reveal and
01:40:19.52 --> 01:40:24.56 when to reveal them as part of a large approach. However, much specifically revealed,
01:40:25.28 --> 01:40:30.32 publicizing adherence to high standards in realistic training can help sustain the Marine
01:40:30.32 --> 01:40:35.44 Corps's reputational advantage and affect the thinking of our nation's competitors. Once again,
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:44.08 the Marine Corps with this manual is increasing their budget. It's a traction for the DOD is what it is.
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:52.96 Marines need to understand the impact of culture when they use information as a competitive tool.
01:40:52.96 --> 01:40:57.36 Cultural differences affect how narratives are interpreted by various audiences. One message
01:40:57.36 --> 01:41:02.08 might be understood in one country in a way that is significantly different from how it is understood.
01:41:02.08 --> 01:41:07.12 And another, Marines must account for this and focus the narratives we use so that our target
01:41:07.12 --> 01:41:11.52 audience understands our message the way that we intend. Yes, know the story.
01:41:11.52 --> 01:41:17.68 Know the story going back to the unraveling podcast. What is your story? Know people's stories.
01:41:21.92 --> 01:41:27.52 The spectrum and styles of competition. The next section. The usual condition of internal
01:41:27.52 --> 01:41:31.20 relations is one of competition across the elements of national power.
01:41:33.76 --> 01:41:39.68 Below the violence threshold, we typically see activities from the non-military aspects of national
01:41:39.68 --> 01:41:45.36 power. For example, economic competition is seen as a national level in the struggle for market
01:41:45.36 --> 01:41:51.20 chair in particular industry or the effort to negotiate favorable terms in a trade agreement.
01:41:51.20 --> 01:41:56.48 Asculation on the spectrum, we might see sharper economic acts like industrial espionage,
01:41:56.48 --> 01:42:00.96 the theft of internet and intellectual property, use of sanctions. What's interesting about this is
01:42:02.16 --> 01:42:03.92 how often do we go to war?
01:42:03.92 --> 01:42:11.68 Right, like if you think about all the interactions that America has globally for the last
01:42:11.68 --> 01:42:18.64 240, 50 years, all these interactions all the time are constantly happening, tariffs and sanctions
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:22.72 and all of these things are happening all the time. And very seldom do we actually pull the
01:42:22.72 --> 01:42:31.44 trigger across the national violence. And that's, we should do that as as infrequently as possible,
01:42:31.44 --> 01:42:36.72 obviously, and you should assess your own leadership in the same spectrum. How often do I have to
01:42:36.72 --> 01:42:41.04 use direct leadership? It should be extremely infrequently.
01:42:48.80 --> 01:42:54.40 Repetitive actions can also move the line up or down over time. This is about how you kind of
01:42:54.40 --> 01:43:01.36 move up and down these continuums all the time. Gradualism and salami slicing, which we talked
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:07.20 about before last one, competitors use these activities in an effort to achieve their aims
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:10.72 without provoking a state of war or even a strong reaction.
01:43:16.96 --> 01:43:21.12 In addition to competing through attraction, coercion and various forms illustrated above
01:43:21.12 --> 01:43:27.12 Marines can also compete by imposing costs. We impose costs on arrival when we develop a
01:43:27.12 --> 01:43:32.32 credible capability and arrival must spend resources in order to try and counter it.
01:43:32.32 --> 01:43:38.32 For example, the Department of Defense has experienced increasing cyber attacks in the past decades.
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:42.48 This has imposed costs because the Department of Defense has to suspend time and money
01:43:42.72 --> 01:43:47.84 to develop civilian training, the count of those attacks. We can also fast forward when we can
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:53.92 also impose costs during war when we first enforce the adversary to divert resources from their
01:43:53.92 --> 01:44:00.40 preferred actions in order to counter one of our capabilities. Then we get into the threshold of violence.
01:44:02.16 --> 01:44:08.32 The threat of violence and violent acts are competitive tools in international relations. The goal
01:44:08.32 --> 01:44:13.44 of posturing is to affect the decision making of the target to make them so fearful of the
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:17.52 damage they might receive if the posturing escalates to violence that they submit and let the
01:44:17.52 --> 01:44:24.72 posture achieve their goals. And it places one into a favorable position should violence follow.
01:44:24.72 --> 01:44:29.44 Just think about that psychologically. If we start to think about the continuum of influence or leadership
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:39.92 and you start using direct influence, that's what you're doing. You're crossing over that threshold
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:44.72 where people are forced to submit. That's why you get the equal and opposite reaction.
01:44:46.40 --> 01:44:51.20 In some cases, the posturing briefly crosses the threshold and violence occurs to demonstrate
01:44:51.20 --> 01:44:57.84 the resolve of the actor. This brief use of violence still has the same aim which is to affect
01:44:57.84 --> 01:45:04.96 the target's decision. Many actors intentionally try to obscure or confuse exactly where this
01:45:04.96 --> 01:45:14.40 threshold lies. That's a good one. Where is that threshold? You ever known someone that just
01:45:14.40 --> 01:45:21.60 crazy eyes, like a crazy eyes person? How about your bouncing at a bar? There's some people where
01:45:21.60 --> 01:45:26.56 you don't know where the line is. They could shank you at any moment. Right? And now you have to
01:45:26.56 --> 01:45:38.80 contend with that. And there's people that proactively proactively prop up that image. It's a good move.
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:47.84 Where you have, you might think that's a good move as a leader. But what you're really doing is
01:45:47.84 --> 01:45:52.88 now what you're doing is you're inducing more fear. And now people don't know when you're going to
01:45:52.88 --> 01:45:58.72 lash out. And so now they're on eggshells and they're afraid to speak up and speak out. And it's a problem.
01:46:05.44 --> 01:46:13.20 This has been, oh, um, they do this to cause enough ambiguity and hesitation that they can
01:46:13.20 --> 01:46:17.52 achieve their aims with little or no interference. This has been true historically. And we'll
01:46:17.52 --> 01:46:21.76 likely increase in the future some rivals use capabilities like certain cyber and space activities
01:46:21.76 --> 01:46:26.96 that have destructive effects but false short of some definitions of violence and effort to obscure
01:46:26.96 --> 01:46:32.24 whether or not they would across the threshold as a push on the on the low. And support a U.S.
01:46:32.24 --> 01:46:36.000 calls Marines perform missions on both sides of the violence threshold. In some case,
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.44 Marines were introduced into situations below the violence threshold. But then a political group
01:46:41.44 --> 01:46:47.44 performed a violent act against U.S. interests. The discipline response of the Marines then occurred
01:46:47.44 --> 01:46:52.80 above the threshold of violence, but the violence was limited and did not reach the level of conventional
01:46:52.80 --> 01:46:57.36 war following these brief periods of violence. The competition again fell below the violence
01:46:57.36 --> 01:47:04.80 threshold in most cases. Now we get into decision making initiative and response.
01:47:06.80 --> 01:47:10.40 You might just call that a whole thing execution. I'm not 100% sure, but you might.
01:47:10.40 --> 01:47:18.96 So Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result of decisions
01:47:18.96 --> 01:47:30.56 or of non-decision. It's so powerful to paint things so clearly. This is whoever wrote this
01:47:30.56 --> 01:47:36.16 opener right here because you know how many people wrote this book Dave. Six six six six
01:47:36.16 --> 01:47:41.60 six. The person at the wrote this section gets a little bonus credit.
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:47.84 Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result
01:47:47.84 --> 01:47:54.08 of decisions or non-decisions. If we lack the will required to make a decision then we have
01:47:54.08 --> 01:48:02.56 willingly surrendered the initiative to our full. If we consciously postpone taking action for
01:48:02.56 --> 01:48:06.08 For some reason, this is also a decision.
01:48:06.08 --> 01:48:07.36 So there you go.
01:48:07.36 --> 01:48:10.08 Boom.
01:48:10.08 --> 01:48:11.08 That's the little section.
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:14.12 You got to highlight terminal lands out there.
01:48:14.12 --> 01:48:16.68 I mean, this is what we're talking about.
01:48:16.68 --> 01:48:22.20 Initiative is as important in competition as it is in war, gaining the initiative means
01:48:22.20 --> 01:48:25.04 our competitor must react to us.
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:30.72 We can gain it by presenting a dilemma to our competitor and also by setting the tempo
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:35.28 of the activity taking place.
01:48:35.28 --> 01:48:38.28 Brian Stan, when he was on here's operational tempo.
01:48:38.28 --> 01:48:42.48 He loved, he loved, he loved everyone's got their move.
01:48:42.48 --> 01:48:45.36 In Gigi, two of them got their, they got that key, a team.
01:48:45.36 --> 01:48:49.16 They got that Camira, they got that heel hook.
01:48:49.16 --> 01:48:52.84 When Brian Stan was on here, I just remember him talking about that operational tempo
01:48:52.84 --> 01:48:59.64 where it's going to, and I'll, that's what he's, that's what this guy's talking about.
01:48:59.64 --> 01:49:01.88 Setting the tempo of the activity.
01:49:01.88 --> 01:49:07.08 Marines must assume that potential competitors understand initiative as well as we do.
01:49:07.08 --> 01:49:10.64 Thus they will take actions in order to gain the initiative.
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.48 Many competitors also seek to create ambiguity about their actions which leads to a problem
01:49:15.48 --> 01:49:17.32 of attribution.
01:49:17.32 --> 01:49:21.24 If we are not certain who performed a certain action, then we cannot attribute that
01:49:21.24 --> 01:49:23.80 action to any particular actor.
01:49:23.80 --> 01:49:27.68 This often delays our response and slows our tempo.
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:33.28 Firstly, if we improve understanding of how of our competitor, we can be primed to attribute
01:49:33.28 --> 01:49:38.16 their actions in ways that slow their tempo instead.
01:49:38.16 --> 01:49:43.84 To know that and to be able to recognize, oh, this isn't just, it's not just that I can't
01:49:43.84 --> 01:49:46.12 figure out exactly who did this.
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:50.44 It's that I am now my Udalupe is slowing down right now.
01:49:50.44 --> 01:49:56.72 Because I think they did it, but I can't be sure.
01:49:56.72 --> 01:50:03.08 While competition essentially always exists, it's intensity varies over the course of time.
01:50:03.08 --> 01:50:07.08 We must also understand that the long timelines involved in competition mean decisions and
01:50:07.08 --> 01:50:10.96 actions sometimes play out over months or years, even decades in some cases.
01:50:10.96 --> 01:50:16.04 This often results in opportunistic behavior as rivals take advantage of conditions to achieve
01:50:16.04 --> 01:50:22.000 their strategic goals without crossing the violence threshold or crossing it briefly.
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.52 And then returning low to threshold before triggering a war.
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:30.88 The journey is often created when conditions suddenly change or temporarily, such as when
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:33.92 a pandemic strikes, a pandemic strikes, which is interesting.
01:50:33.92 --> 01:50:36.48 I don't know if they wrote this before or after.
01:50:36.48 --> 01:50:38.12 I get they probably slid it in there.
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:39.12 You think they slid it in there?
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:41.60 Yeah, I think this was drafted like this last year.
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:47.24 Yeah, they slid it in there such as this diverts attention and resources which creates
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:53.60 a gap for an alert competitor to exploit.
01:50:53.60 --> 01:51:02.56 Having no fixed timeline for achieving goals, plus opportunism also leads to incrementalism,
01:51:02.56 --> 01:51:07.80 which is the effort to achieve a goal by adding together a number of small steps taken
01:51:07.80 --> 01:51:10.52 on a path toward it.
01:51:10.52 --> 01:51:16.96 Achieving our goals in competition requires action which comes from making decisions.
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:21.44 Therefore what Marines are taught for war fighting serves them well here provided, they
01:51:21.44 --> 01:51:26.000 also apply judgment in recognizing how timelines can differ between war and the rest of the
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.20 competition continuum.
01:51:28.20 --> 01:51:32.48 So this idea of incrementalism is something you got to be on the lookout for.
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:40.48 You got to be on the lookout for that slow creeping maneuver that your enemies making.
01:51:40.48 --> 01:51:47.96 And at some point you got to draw the line what I recommend is instead of drawing a line,
01:51:47.96 --> 01:51:51.64 what you do is you incrementally respond.
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:57.92 So when that go, makes it a little maneuver, that's a little bit offensive to me.
01:51:57.92 --> 01:52:00.04 I just don't say well he hasn't really crossed the line.
01:52:00.04 --> 01:52:02.64 I actually give a little bit of a check, a little check.
01:52:02.64 --> 01:52:04.64 That's a little check.
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:06.32 So from a leadership perspective, what does that mean?
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:12.28 It means when Dave, when Dave decides he's going to spend a little bit too much money on the
01:52:12.28 --> 01:52:18.98 company credit card, I don't just go well, I don't really eat him like cross line.
01:52:18.98 --> 01:52:24.62 I might say, hey Dave, I see I see got it some expenses here that are, what is this?
01:52:24.62 --> 01:52:26.14 What did you buy?
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:32.44 Just check and oh yeah, I just needed some oil for my car.
01:52:32.44 --> 01:52:34.36 Okay, but for your car.
01:52:34.36 --> 01:52:37.12 Yeah, yeah, well, okay.
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.84 Was that for a company trip?
01:52:38.84 --> 01:52:41.16 No, no, no, no, no, I'll change.
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:42.16 I'll talk to you.
01:52:42.16 --> 01:52:43.16 We'll get it straight now.
01:52:43.16 --> 01:52:47.04 Okay, because you're trying to incrementally see if you can start putting real stuff on
01:52:47.04 --> 01:52:49.76 the company credit card.
01:52:49.76 --> 01:52:52.56 No, you can't.
01:52:52.56 --> 01:52:57.68 But if I don't check you, if instead I draw a line in the sand, well now all of a sudden
01:52:57.68 --> 01:53:00.92 you've developed a pattern and you've gotten a habit and you could actually come back
01:53:00.92 --> 01:53:02.40 to me and say well, I'll be doing this for a while.
01:53:02.40 --> 01:53:03.76 I don't want any of that.
01:53:03.76 --> 01:53:06.56 So I'm going to check you.
01:53:06.56 --> 01:53:11.08 Am I going to check you with a, with a hockey stick across the face?
01:53:11.08 --> 01:53:14.76 No, I'm going to give you a little test a little.
01:53:14.76 --> 01:53:15.76 I'm here.
01:53:15.76 --> 01:53:17.64 I see what's happening.
01:53:17.64 --> 01:53:25.32 I don't draw a line in the sand because in a line in the sand can be offensive.
01:53:25.32 --> 01:53:26.32 Yeah.
01:53:26.32 --> 01:53:34.96 And why did you break a rule if you knew the rule is there?
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:40.48 If you broke a rule, I probably did a bad job of explaining that hey man, company credit
01:53:40.48 --> 01:53:44.40 cards, we use them for company business.
01:53:44.40 --> 01:53:49.96 And what we can't do is we can't have a bunch of little charges adding up over time and
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:54.80 then we look up and we, we have lost a bunch of money and spending on things that don't really
01:53:54.80 --> 01:53:56.48 benefit the company.
01:53:56.48 --> 01:54:04.56 So anything that you think you're using for your personal gain or for your personal life
01:54:04.56 --> 01:54:07.52 is not allowed.
01:54:07.52 --> 01:54:11.08 So that's a little bit of a line, but I'm not, I'm not smack in you with it.
01:54:11.08 --> 01:54:13.40 I'm showing it to you.
01:54:13.40 --> 01:54:16.28 And you've got, you have options when you take that approach.
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:20.56 You can, there's a lot of different things you can do in there.
01:54:20.56 --> 01:54:27.64 And the, the problem with the line is that that basically commits you to, to, to a response
01:54:27.64 --> 01:54:32.48 to a course of action that you, it's really, really hard to maneuver away from that.
01:54:32.48 --> 01:54:35.36 And if you're using the line like, hey, if I just draw the line, then, then Jocco's
01:54:35.36 --> 01:54:37.32 not going to cross the line.
01:54:37.32 --> 01:54:40.64 I use it more as a tool to keep you from doing it than it's actually what I'm really willing
01:54:40.64 --> 01:54:41.64 to do.
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:44.28 You have almost no maneuver space there.
01:54:44.28 --> 01:54:45.60 And you talk about that's all the time.
01:54:45.60 --> 01:54:49.36 You want to keep as many options as much maneuverability as you can.
01:54:49.36 --> 01:54:51.84 And that line takes all that away from me.
01:54:51.84 --> 01:54:54.32 And if the line is just a tool to get you to comply.
01:54:54.32 --> 01:54:57.32 And that person, this is talking about an adversary.
01:54:57.32 --> 01:55:03.64 This is an alert adversary looking for ways to commit you that limits anything that limits
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:04.64 your options.
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:07.28 And certainly I know this about the Marine Corps is something we don't want.
01:55:07.28 --> 01:55:15.92 Isn't a beautiful thing when the line is implied with such strength that I never even
01:55:15.92 --> 01:55:17.92 set it, but you're new, not to cross it.
01:55:17.92 --> 01:55:21.68 How many how many charges have you made on your company credit card for your personal
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:22.68 game?
01:55:22.68 --> 01:55:23.68 The answer is zero.
01:55:23.68 --> 01:55:24.68 Right?
01:55:24.68 --> 01:55:25.68 And not doing that here.
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:27.68 And not out of fear of compliance either.
01:55:27.68 --> 01:55:32.48 Or, or compliance based on fear, but out of a recognition of why that actually is what
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:34.28 you should be doing.
01:55:34.28 --> 01:55:37.72 And there's some things inside here that translate perfectly.
01:55:37.72 --> 01:55:44.24 And there's some things you actually have to think about because this publication, this
01:55:44.24 --> 01:55:48.96 manual is really in a lot of ways talking about competitors.
01:55:48.96 --> 01:55:55.64 And there's a component there that directly aligns well when you're competing with
01:55:55.64 --> 01:55:56.64 you're running a company.
01:55:56.64 --> 01:55:58.16 There's a competitive company.
01:55:58.16 --> 01:56:04.000 But the connection to the leadership piece to your people, you got to kind of translate that
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000 a little bit.
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.60 You don't want to go to war with your people.
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:10.88 Your goal isn't to set that line to establish your authority so they comply.
01:56:10.88 --> 01:56:12.84 You want to avoid that.
01:56:12.84 --> 01:56:15.44 It almost all costs.
01:56:15.44 --> 01:56:17.32 But you need your into same thing with my kids.
01:56:17.32 --> 01:56:20.40 Do I want my son to know that there's a line?
01:56:20.40 --> 01:56:21.40 Yes.
01:56:21.40 --> 01:56:23.12 He and he knows.
01:56:23.12 --> 01:56:26.48 He almost, well, it happens, but he doesn't cross that line very often.
01:56:26.48 --> 01:56:30.12 I'm not forced to respond in a limited way very often.
01:56:30.12 --> 01:56:31.52 But I want him to know that.
01:56:31.52 --> 01:56:36.24 So let's say there is a street in front of your house, really busy.
01:56:36.24 --> 01:56:41.04 Would you put the line that you're son when he's four years old?
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:43.04 Would you put the line at the street?
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:44.04 No.
01:56:44.04 --> 01:56:45.04 How no.
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:46.52 You put the line a little further back.
01:56:46.52 --> 01:56:52.28 And would you then escalate like, hey, you can't go past this?
01:56:52.28 --> 01:56:56.76 This is 20 yards from the road where you could get killed.
01:56:56.76 --> 01:56:57.76 That's what we do.
01:56:57.76 --> 01:56:58.76 Yeah.
01:56:58.76 --> 01:57:03.32 Even the actual line where you're going to like give significant punishment because
01:57:03.32 --> 01:57:12.60 you have to impress upon the kid, like my dog, kid dog.
01:57:12.60 --> 01:57:14.20 My dog, I have this.
01:57:14.20 --> 01:57:21.92 And my house, if my dog goes out off my front porch, he's going to be on a street with
01:57:21.92 --> 01:57:24.44 his car.
01:57:24.44 --> 01:57:28.88 I gave him hard corrections when he was a puppy that now I've done leave there.
01:57:28.88 --> 01:57:30.12 He knows what's up.
01:57:30.12 --> 01:57:31.92 He knows that he can't do it.
01:57:31.92 --> 01:57:34.12 So that's where the line isn't.
01:57:34.12 --> 01:57:40.96 He could go off my porch and go another 15 yards before he'd actually get hit.
01:57:40.96 --> 01:57:42.48 But I don't give him that extra 15 yards.
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:43.96 I give him like, okay, here it is.
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:48.68 Don't go across this line and he's been trained and he understands it.
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:52.76 So that's what you got to watch out for.
01:57:52.76 --> 01:57:57.20 When your dog might not ever make this connection, but the obvious goal with your people
01:57:57.20 --> 01:58:00.000 is that the recognition is that it's in their business.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.76 You're trying to help them.
01:58:01.76 --> 01:58:05.46 And that's the piece of like, hey, when you're talking about your adversaries and you
01:58:05.46 --> 01:58:07.76 haven't talked a little bit about coercion.
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:12.60 In some way, we're actually even though our adversaries basically trying to say, hey, don't
01:58:12.60 --> 01:58:13.88 do this.
01:58:13.88 --> 01:58:15.48 This is in your best interest.
01:58:15.48 --> 01:58:17.76 Please don't do this.
01:58:17.76 --> 01:58:20.40 Or, hey, I'm going to really need you to do this.
01:58:20.40 --> 01:58:25.80 But from a leadership standpoint, all those things, even those lines that you draw, the ideal
01:58:25.80 --> 01:58:29.32 situation is usually it's actually what's in their best interest and they're pushing
01:58:29.32 --> 01:58:30.32 against it.
01:58:30.32 --> 01:58:32.96 You might want to find out why they're pushing against that.
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:38.56 Anyway, I just think that that connection of what's in their best interest and that
01:58:38.56 --> 01:58:43.72 that line, I mean, we, you want to be able to maneuver as much as possible all the time
01:58:43.72 --> 01:58:47.16 and keep as many options open as possible.
01:58:47.16 --> 01:58:52.20 So that line should be just be real cautious about drawing that explicitly.
01:58:52.20 --> 01:58:55.92 And if you do, if you can get them to understand why that's there, that's so much more powerful
01:58:55.92 --> 01:58:58.44 than it's just, hey, I'm going to hand me if you hit the cross line.
01:58:58.44 --> 01:59:00.44 Yeah.
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:02.16 The Y is huge.
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:07.16 And if they don't understand why, then it's an arbitrary thing that you threw up there.
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:09.92 And look, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have that.
01:59:09.92 --> 01:59:13.88 Because if people, you should absolutely have lines where, hey, you cross this line,
01:59:13.88 --> 01:59:19.68 you made it as ethical mistake, you do something that's actively freaking criminal.
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:20.68 You're done.
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:21.68 That's where we're at.
01:59:21.68 --> 01:59:25.28 Just so everybody knows, you do something like that.
01:59:25.28 --> 01:59:26.28 You're done.
01:59:26.28 --> 01:59:27.28 Period end of story.
01:59:27.28 --> 01:59:28.88 There's no, there's not even discussion.
01:59:28.88 --> 01:59:34.56 So don't do that.
01:59:34.56 --> 01:59:39.80 Getting into the conclusion, like war, competition serves policy, but usually does so
01:59:39.80 --> 01:59:46.72 over longer spans of time, these long time lines lead us to look for policies, aims in our enduring
01:59:46.72 --> 01:59:51.28 national interests with aspects of these interests emphasized by current state of domestic
01:59:51.28 --> 01:59:52.92 policies, politics.
01:59:52.92 --> 01:59:57.20 Again, apply that to your personal life, apply that to your business.
01:59:57.20 --> 01:59:58.72 What are you trying to do?
01:59:58.72 --> 02:00:03.52 What are your enduring interests?
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:06.36 Attraction is important concept in our theory of competition.
02:00:06.36 --> 02:00:11.20 It uses incentives and rewards to get another political actor to act differently in ways
02:00:11.20 --> 02:00:12.68 that are aligned with our interests.
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.76 That's what we're doing as a leader.
02:00:14.76 --> 02:00:17.000 We're using attraction.
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.60 We're using coercion.
02:00:19.60 --> 02:00:20.60 We're using the stick.
02:00:20.60 --> 02:00:21.60 We're using the carrot.
02:00:21.60 --> 02:00:22.96 What do we want to use?
02:00:22.96 --> 02:00:27.64 We want to use the carrot as much as possible.
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:28.64 And you know what?
02:00:28.64 --> 02:00:34.96 We want them to think they found that carrot.
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:37.48 Our version is another important component of our theory.
02:00:37.48 --> 02:00:43.60 It takes two forms, compelence to cause a rival to take action favorable to our goals and
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:47.76 deterrence to cause a rival to not take action.
02:00:47.76 --> 02:00:49.08 That's what you were asking earlier, I think.
02:00:49.08 --> 02:00:53.16 I don't know if I gave you that clear of an answer.
02:00:53.16 --> 02:00:55.64 In war, we impose our will on an enemy.
02:00:55.64 --> 02:01:00.72 With coercion, we need our rivals cooperation because they must decide to comply with
02:01:00.72 --> 02:01:02.20 our wishes.
02:01:02.20 --> 02:01:07.28 And if their cooperation is unwilling, the existence of the Marine Corps is a coercive
02:01:07.28 --> 02:01:09.64 tool for the nation.
02:01:09.64 --> 02:01:16.000 If its competitive advantages advantage is made clear to a rival.
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.76 Competitors act like systems.
02:01:17.76 --> 02:01:23.48 They have many parts that interact with each other in complex, often unpredictable ways.
02:01:23.48 --> 02:01:28.32 This also means competitors have strengths and weaknesses as competition unfolds over time.
02:01:28.32 --> 02:01:35.000 The rival systems can sense what their competitor is trying to do and adapt or evolve in
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.60 an effort to improve their competitive advantage.
02:01:37.60 --> 02:01:39.60 It's always adapting.
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:44.04 These will often blend the threat of violence or the use of violence itself with other
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:47.60 tools to gain an advantage.
02:01:47.60 --> 02:01:53.04 This constantly shifting mixture can get confusing, which is part of the goal.
02:01:53.04 --> 02:01:57.04 Competitors often intend for this confusion to help them reach their goals by causing their
02:01:57.04 --> 02:02:01.92 rivals to hesitate.
02:02:01.92 --> 02:02:08.24 This also helps them gain the initiative so that they can set the pace of the tempo for
02:02:08.24 --> 02:02:09.24 the competition.
02:02:09.24 --> 02:02:14.80 I'm more or two hours deep right now.
02:02:14.80 --> 02:02:15.80 I'm not even getting it.
02:02:15.80 --> 02:02:20.56 Well, the chapter three is next.
02:02:20.56 --> 02:02:28.44 You know, something that I say and I think you and I discussed this the other day on the
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:34.28 phone Dave, the best way to win is when the enemy doesn't even know the fighting.
02:02:34.28 --> 02:02:40.28 What Sunsu was, the supreme, what Sunsu said was the supreme art of war is to subdue the
02:02:40.28 --> 02:02:43.36 enemy without fighting.
02:02:43.36 --> 02:02:46.12 That's what we're trying to do.
02:02:46.12 --> 02:02:54.16 To win, to influence Dave without Dave even knowing that I influenced him.
02:02:54.16 --> 02:02:58.32 I want to maneuver my ideas into your head so that you think they're, they're, they're your
02:02:58.32 --> 02:03:01.08 ideas.
02:03:01.08 --> 02:03:05.96 I want to preemptively remove your will to fight before you even think you should be
02:03:05.96 --> 02:03:10.12 in a fight before before you even think you should be putting up resistance.
02:03:10.12 --> 02:03:12.08 You already are thinking that you don't want to resist.
02:03:12.08 --> 02:03:13.08 That's my goal.
02:03:13.08 --> 02:03:22.44 I want to make you a champion of my cause as if it were your own cause.
02:03:22.44 --> 02:03:25.40 That's what we're trying to make happen.
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:28.04 And by the way, what what makes this easy?
02:03:28.04 --> 02:03:35.24 Er, what makes this and actually makes it easy is when my cause is your cause because
02:03:35.24 --> 02:03:37.000 you're, it helps you.
02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.60 If I'm over here trying to convince you to do something that doesn't help you, man, it's
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:41.72 freaking hard.
02:03:41.72 --> 02:03:50.60 But when I can align my goals with your goals and I can give you ownership, that allows,
02:03:50.60 --> 02:03:58.36 that allows these strategies and tactics for you to get on board with what I want you
02:03:58.36 --> 02:04:06.92 to do and you don't even know that I'm trying to make you do it.
02:04:06.92 --> 02:04:11.12 So this one of the most important things about this manual is simply making you aware
02:04:11.12 --> 02:04:18.80 that you're competing and you have to be aware that you're also influencing all the time
02:04:18.80 --> 02:04:24.64 and you're on that spectrum and you're on that continuum and you're either gaining leadership
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:30.44 capital or you're spending it.
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:34.48 And if you do it right, people are on board.
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:41.08 And the deeper part of that is you are actually propelling them towards victory, form
02:04:41.08 --> 02:04:44.08 or them.
02:04:44.08 --> 02:04:49.68 If you do it right, you're propelling them towards victory and they are happy to be
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:52.20 moving there.
02:04:52.20 --> 02:04:57.96 And if I'm trying to get Dave to do something that he's resistant to and it's going
02:04:57.96 --> 02:05:00.64 to help him in the long run, it's going to help us in the long run.
02:05:00.64 --> 02:05:01.64 Why is he resistant?
02:05:01.64 --> 02:05:04.72 I need to listen to him to see what his resistance is.
02:05:04.72 --> 02:05:11.56 Why is he resisting?
02:05:11.56 --> 02:05:13.84 That's what we're doing.
02:05:13.84 --> 02:05:20.24 We're on a constant continuum of influence.
02:05:20.24 --> 02:05:29.76 Yes, we're competing but we're influencing as leaders.
02:05:29.76 --> 02:05:38.60 We're also competing obviously.
02:05:38.60 --> 02:05:42.80 We want to stay competitive in a multitude of ways.
02:05:42.80 --> 02:05:52.08 We'll say any ways that you can recommend for us to maybe maintain or improve our competitive
02:05:52.08 --> 02:05:53.40 advantage in the world.
02:05:53.40 --> 02:05:54.40 What do you think?
02:05:54.40 --> 02:06:03.28 First one, which I think goes unnoticed and you do good job in reminding us from time
02:06:03.28 --> 02:06:07.08 to time is what game are you playing?
02:06:07.08 --> 02:06:10.32 Isn't that one of the questions you always get?
02:06:10.32 --> 02:06:12.32 What motivates you?
02:06:12.32 --> 02:06:14.000 Right, you get that one a lot.
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:20.16 Still kind of a question that you kind of got to ask yourself a lot of the time.
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:24.38 Because it kind of seems like okay, so getting in shape, for example, or being
02:06:24.38 --> 02:06:26.98 in shape, shape, and shape whatever.
02:06:26.98 --> 02:06:30.78 For some for the average person, whatever that even means because I don't know what that
02:06:30.78 --> 02:06:31.78 actually even is.
02:06:31.78 --> 02:06:37.62 But to wake up before 30 and do and it's not like you're waking up in 430 and doing
02:06:37.62 --> 02:06:45.34 a stretching routine for 10 minutes, like you're kind of going hard.
02:06:45.34 --> 02:06:46.62 That's every single day.
02:06:46.62 --> 02:06:49.62 Not to say you're going full speed every single day.
02:06:49.62 --> 02:06:54.70 But I'm just saying your routine is like the average person not going to do that.
02:06:54.70 --> 02:06:57.06 So you're over here going hard.
02:06:57.06 --> 02:06:58.06 But why?
02:06:58.06 --> 02:06:59.06 You know?
02:06:59.06 --> 02:07:00.06 Competitive advantage.
02:07:00.06 --> 02:07:01.06 Yes.
02:07:01.06 --> 02:07:02.06 Competitive advantage.
02:07:02.06 --> 02:07:03.06 Exactly.
02:07:03.06 --> 02:07:05.06 So what I'm saying is in your head it's there.
02:07:05.06 --> 02:07:08.70 But I think in like a lot of our head this segment is not always there like we've got
02:07:08.70 --> 02:07:10.30 to kind of get reminded everyone's own.
02:07:10.30 --> 02:07:14.94 You know, just to confirm things in the world.
02:07:14.94 --> 02:07:16.82 You know, in discipline it goes freedom field manual.
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:24.62 But let's talk about like how if you exercise, you'll be sharper mentally sharper.
02:07:24.62 --> 02:07:30.62 And then hearing that chess player the other day Gary Kasparov talk about how if you're
02:07:30.62 --> 02:07:32.78 in shape it's going to help you win at chess.
02:07:32.78 --> 02:07:36.34 I was like keep working out people.
02:07:36.34 --> 02:07:38.54 Keep working out people.
02:07:38.54 --> 02:07:39.94 That's what you need to do.
02:07:39.94 --> 02:07:40.94 Yeah.
02:07:40.94 --> 02:07:44.86 And you're kind of always your mind's kind of seems to be anyway always kind of in that
02:07:44.86 --> 02:07:50.18 zone where it's like you're kind of looking for some kind of advantage or something to add
02:07:50.18 --> 02:07:52.54 to, you know, your deal or whatever.
02:07:52.54 --> 02:07:56.58 But for the every person, I think some of us don't do that all the time because we kind
02:07:56.58 --> 02:07:59.02 of forget or maybe to get distracted or whatever.
02:07:59.02 --> 02:08:00.06 Maybe that's the same thing.
02:08:00.06 --> 02:08:03.50 But where that's why people they'll work out less.
02:08:03.50 --> 02:08:05.62 More things going on all this stuff, right?
02:08:05.62 --> 02:08:06.62 So they forget.
02:08:06.62 --> 02:08:07.62 Yeah.
02:08:07.62 --> 02:08:08.62 Yeah.
02:08:08.62 --> 02:08:11.62 You got that.
02:08:11.62 --> 02:08:12.62 Let's face it.
02:08:12.62 --> 02:08:17.42 You pour all your efforts into your job.
02:08:17.42 --> 02:08:20.86 Your family and your physical health are going to fall.
02:08:20.86 --> 02:08:25.26 If you pour all your efforts into your family, your job and your physical health is going
02:08:25.26 --> 02:08:26.26 to fail.
02:08:26.26 --> 02:08:30.54 If you pour all your efforts into your physical health, your job and your family are
02:08:30.54 --> 02:08:33.02 going to fail.
02:08:33.02 --> 02:08:37.06 So we have to be balanced.
02:08:37.06 --> 02:08:41.14 If you let the physical one fall apart, that's going to negatively impact the other.
02:08:41.14 --> 02:08:43.50 I actually, they all, they all impact each other, right?
02:08:43.50 --> 02:08:44.50 They all impact each other.
02:08:44.50 --> 02:08:50.10 But let's face it as you pointed out on one of the earliest of these podcasts.
02:08:50.10 --> 02:08:55.22 The physical one will help you across the board in all aspects of the game.
02:08:55.22 --> 02:08:56.62 So the way, maybe the best game.
02:08:56.62 --> 02:08:57.62 The game.
02:08:57.62 --> 02:08:59.74 The game straight up.
02:08:59.74 --> 02:09:03.02 In a way, the best way, the best strategy, you know, instead of pouring everything you
02:09:03.02 --> 02:09:07.82 have into your XYZ, whatever one thing you align them all and understand that they're
02:09:07.82 --> 02:09:12.46 all this, what it call it in business, vertically integrated and whatever.
02:09:12.46 --> 02:09:13.46 Right?
02:09:13.46 --> 02:09:14.46 Just called the path.
02:09:14.46 --> 02:09:15.46 The path.
02:09:15.46 --> 02:09:16.46 Yeah, same thing.
02:09:16.46 --> 02:09:18.74 So look, I'm going to exercise, be capable on duty, get to.
02:09:18.74 --> 02:09:24.10 I'm going to improve all my applicable skills.
02:09:24.10 --> 02:09:28.34 So I can be a better whatever those things are, whatever you are.
02:09:28.34 --> 02:09:31.06 You seem to have to know what you're going with.
02:09:31.06 --> 02:09:32.90 People should get supplements for more than you may.
02:09:32.90 --> 02:09:33.90 Is that what you're going with?
02:09:33.90 --> 02:09:36.94 I think I just saw little connection getting made.
02:09:36.94 --> 02:09:41.94 I'm going to make that connection in 20 minutes.
02:09:41.94 --> 02:09:42.94 I'm down.
02:09:42.94 --> 02:09:43.94 I'm down.
02:09:43.94 --> 02:09:47.42 See that kind of artistic maneuver.
02:09:47.42 --> 02:09:50.62 The intellectual sharpness as you bring it in for the big win and all of a sudden you're
02:09:50.62 --> 02:09:53.66 talking about how we're going to get some supplementation.
02:09:53.66 --> 02:09:55.42 I'm hype on that.
02:09:55.42 --> 02:10:01.26 But when we start going 12 minutes and we're talking about alignment and vertical integration,
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:02.26 this is an important thing.
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:03.26 Okay.
02:10:03.26 --> 02:10:04.26 I'll just say it.
02:10:04.26 --> 02:10:08.10 Now you did have one person respond on social media that they are listening.
02:10:08.10 --> 02:10:09.10 Right now.
02:10:09.10 --> 02:10:13.10 So that person is happy that you're going down the path of whatever you're going down.
02:10:13.10 --> 02:10:14.10 Hey, look.
02:10:14.10 --> 02:10:15.10 Which is fine.
02:10:15.10 --> 02:10:16.10 Oh, right.
02:10:16.10 --> 02:10:18.54 Well, hey, better to be over-inform then under-informed.
02:10:18.54 --> 02:10:19.54 Okay.
02:10:19.54 --> 02:10:20.54 So, hey, look data.
02:10:20.54 --> 02:10:24.22 I don't know if we can make that necessarily a blanket statement because I think
02:10:24.22 --> 02:10:26.70 the people that are right now are questioning.
02:10:26.70 --> 02:10:27.70 Well, I love this.
02:10:27.70 --> 02:10:29.74 I mean, in this scenario that we're in at this moment.
02:10:29.74 --> 02:10:30.94 Hey, thanks for helping it alone.
02:10:30.94 --> 02:10:31.94 Okay.
02:10:31.94 --> 02:10:32.94 You know, you're a little bump.
02:10:32.94 --> 02:10:33.94 Push.
02:10:33.94 --> 02:10:34.94 You do a great job.
02:10:34.94 --> 02:10:35.94 A little influence.
02:10:35.94 --> 02:10:36.94 A little influence.
02:10:36.94 --> 02:10:38.94 Anyway, all right.
02:10:38.94 --> 02:10:39.94 Cool.
02:10:39.94 --> 02:10:43.26 Where we're here trying to compete, stay competitive, improve, and maintain our competitive
02:10:43.26 --> 02:10:44.26 advantage.
02:10:44.26 --> 02:10:45.26 Okay.
02:10:45.26 --> 02:10:46.26 Look, we need supplementation.
02:10:46.26 --> 02:10:47.26 Yeah, quickly that worked.
02:10:47.26 --> 02:10:48.26 Yeah.
02:10:48.26 --> 02:10:50.66 I kind of set you up like, hey, how can we maintain competitiveness?
02:10:50.66 --> 02:10:51.90 You could sit boom and you were there.
02:10:51.90 --> 02:10:53.78 I know many things like my idea too.
02:10:53.78 --> 02:10:54.78 There wasn't a lot of money.
02:10:54.78 --> 02:10:55.78 I did.
02:10:55.78 --> 02:10:56.78 I didn't.
02:10:56.78 --> 02:11:00.78 The scene in my head and man, that was like, man, the best idea ever came up, seemingly.
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:01.78 That was a good job.
02:11:01.78 --> 02:11:02.78 Yeah.
02:11:02.78 --> 02:11:03.78 Okay.
02:11:03.78 --> 02:11:06.10 So I'm taking discipline and discipline.
02:11:06.10 --> 02:11:08.66 Go, that's probably why my brain is so sharp.
02:11:08.66 --> 02:11:09.66 Let me say something.
02:11:09.66 --> 02:11:11.30 Let me say something.
02:11:11.30 --> 02:11:14.02 Because even as you're talking about this, people aren't thinking, okay, what
02:11:14.02 --> 02:11:16.14 does this all mean?
02:11:16.14 --> 02:11:18.22 Here's what, here's a bonus thing.
02:11:18.22 --> 02:11:20.30 Because we repeat a lot of the same stuff, right?
02:11:20.30 --> 02:11:21.30 Sure.
02:11:21.30 --> 02:11:22.30 We certainly seem to repeat.
02:11:22.30 --> 02:11:23.30 What are you writing now?
02:11:23.30 --> 02:11:24.30 Nothing.
02:11:24.30 --> 02:11:25.30 Just continue, please, with your thoughts.
02:11:25.30 --> 02:11:26.30 You're making notes.
02:11:26.30 --> 02:11:28.30 That's the indication of that.
02:11:28.30 --> 02:11:29.30 It's that.
02:11:29.30 --> 02:11:30.30 We added in stuff.
02:11:30.30 --> 02:11:31.30 Please, please continue.
02:11:31.30 --> 02:11:32.30 Are we having things?
02:11:32.30 --> 02:11:34.30 You can add it now.
02:11:34.30 --> 02:11:35.30 Check this out.
02:11:35.30 --> 02:11:38.86 I got good news.

02:12:00.90 --> 02:12:01.90 What about the cold oil?
02:12:01.90 --> 02:12:06.90 I guess I have to remember, I have such a stash of this that I forget.
02:12:06.90 --> 02:12:07.90 Geez.
02:12:07.90 --> 02:12:13.18 So, so I am, I am, I'm almost ashamed to say that.
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:17.70 But the only one I don't have a huge stash of is Cold War.
02:12:17.70 --> 02:12:21.54 I think you said vitamin D, maybe that's what you were alluding to.
02:12:21.54 --> 02:12:22.38 What did I say?
02:12:22.38 --> 02:12:23.70 You said vitamin D.
02:12:23.70 --> 02:12:24.70 Yeah.
02:12:24.70 --> 02:12:25.82 I say Cold War.

02:12:52.66 --> 02:12:53.66 So, let me go down the list.
02:12:53.66 --> 02:12:54.66 These are all beneficial things.
02:12:54.66 --> 02:12:57.34 Maintain the competitive edge, joint warfare for your joints.
02:12:57.34 --> 02:12:58.66 Don't worry about that stuff.
02:12:58.66 --> 02:13:00.06 You don't have to worry about your joints anymore.
02:13:00.06 --> 02:13:01.06 Super cruel oil.
02:13:01.06 --> 02:13:02.06 Same deal.
02:13:02.06 --> 02:13:05.58 General health are other benefits, vitamin T3, and it is another one.
02:13:05.58 --> 02:13:10.34 Also cold war, this for immunity and other health benefits.
02:13:10.34 --> 02:13:12.70 Better to have health benefits than health.
02:13:12.70 --> 02:13:14.10 Deutch events.
02:13:14.10 --> 02:13:15.10 Okay.
02:13:15.10 --> 02:13:16.10 Okay.
02:13:16.10 --> 02:13:19.70 You're like, that's the threat, you're like, actually, you're here.
02:13:19.70 --> 02:13:22.28 So, you should release operations that I don't know what you're saying, and the you
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:23.28 hold it off credit.
02:13:23.28 --> 02:13:24.28 Negative credit.
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:26.30 Credit is in the you understand credit.
02:13:26.30 --> 02:13:27.30 Right.
02:13:27.30 --> 02:13:29.98 Anyway, back to the supplements, discipline.
02:13:29.98 --> 02:13:33.02 discipline go. So discipline the powder for your brain for your body
02:13:33.02 --> 02:13:38.02 discipline go, brain body just on the go quicker, delivery system, capsules, and
02:13:38.02 --> 02:13:41.74 also the energy drink form. It's a healthy energy drink by the way if we didn't
02:13:41.74 --> 02:13:46.54 already know, even though we do, that is those are the facts. Also, milk for extra
02:13:46.54 --> 02:13:51.62 protein form and dessert, super delicious tasting protein as a dessert. Yeah,
02:13:51.62 --> 02:13:54.94 you could say extra protein where you just say, oh, if you want also one of
02:13:54.94 --> 02:13:58.58 dessert, cool, you can get some milk. You get them at wall, you get the drinks,
02:13:58.58 --> 02:14:03.62 you can get the the ready to drink the cans at wall wall all the wall
02:14:03.62 --> 02:14:09.46 was by the way, they're in there and vitamin shop. So you can you can get them there
02:14:09.46 --> 02:14:15.42 or you can get them at origin main.com and if you get a subscription, there's a
02:14:15.42 --> 02:14:19.46 little issue with the wall us in area. What is it? I got a lot of videos of
02:14:19.46 --> 02:14:23.26 people just going in there and cleaning it out. So people going there with
02:14:23.26 --> 02:14:28.50 coolers, yeah, going to the shelves of wall and empty every can. So be
02:14:28.50 --> 02:14:33.18 born. Yeah, they're getting after people are getting after it. But the great
02:14:33.18 --> 02:14:38.22 great thing is we started off in Florida and it was sort of a test run for
02:14:38.22 --> 02:14:45.22 walla and everyone went after those. After those things, those and walla and
02:14:45.22 --> 02:14:50.90 just almost like less than a month into it, less than a month into a three
02:14:50.90 --> 02:14:55.70 month trial walla came to us and said, we want you know the stores. So thank
02:14:55.70 --> 02:15:01.14 you for for getting after it and walla was going to deliver walla was also in the
02:15:01.14 --> 02:15:04.90 game because they get tagged a lot from people out there shopping walla and
02:15:04.90 --> 02:15:08.98 they always get a good reply. Awesome. Interesting that yeah, I saw that with a guy
02:15:08.98 --> 02:15:13.18 with the cooler was like a bin and he was like boom, cool. I was like, let's
02:15:13.18 --> 02:15:16.66 interesting. I don't think I've ever been really that compelled to do that with
02:15:16.66 --> 02:15:20.82 it with the like a drink or whatever. I'm saying under what circumstances would I
02:15:20.82 --> 02:15:25.46 be? And then I thought back to it was like maybe like four days or so before
02:15:25.46 --> 02:15:30.42 it were I texted be little with the emergency scenario because I was only on my
02:15:30.42 --> 02:15:34.86 last one. Because I think they'll send it. They'll send it in and because usually
02:15:34.86 --> 02:15:39.62 I don't go to my last one. But what if I'm on my last one and I'm like, wait a
02:15:39.62 --> 02:15:44.90 second I can go to walla and restock. Then you're bringing a cooler. So it makes
02:15:44.90 --> 02:15:47.94 sense. Exactly. Right. That's one other good reason you got here on a
02:15:47.94 --> 02:15:52.46 subscription. That day doesn't come. That day does not come. And we don't want
02:15:52.46 --> 02:15:57.10 that day to come. So yes, you mentioned originate.com. That's where you can get it
02:15:57.10 --> 02:16:05.18 as well. Also an originamine.com. You can get you just to stuff gear, jegees,
02:16:05.18 --> 02:16:10.66 rashguards, against stuff also shirts and sweats and cool clothes as well. This
02:16:10.66 --> 02:16:14.86 is all American made stuff by the way. Big deal. Yeah, you just do competitive
02:16:14.86 --> 02:16:20.30 advantage. Yes, competitive advantage to have not slave labor but awesome
02:16:20.30 --> 02:16:25.38 people. Yeah, you you mentioned that like slave labor like when you kind of
02:16:25.38 --> 02:16:29.54 you know the front end of the slave labor situation, right? You could just be like,
02:16:29.54 --> 02:16:32.62 oh yeah, we'll just make it super cheap. You know, you guys make it and we can
02:16:32.62 --> 02:16:35.42 sell it for higher or whatever. But it's own cares about what they're doing on
02:16:35.42 --> 02:16:39.02 every step. You know, like manufacturer like, okay, my job is to do this and
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:42.46 do this and to do this and I'm going to just do it. But I care about doing it.
02:16:42.46 --> 02:16:46.90 Brother, it's way better. Like quality wise in every capacity and sustainable.
02:16:46.90 --> 02:16:50.66 Yeah. So yes, that is a competitive advantage. What if everyone on your team
02:16:50.66 --> 02:16:52.90 cared about what their job was?
02:16:52.90 --> 02:16:56.02 Brother, that's all right. And so you just nailed that.
02:16:56.02 --> 02:16:58.78 Sure. I agree that that is the case.
02:16:58.78 --> 02:17:02.98 Unless back to how we can all support ourselves.
02:17:02.98 --> 02:17:07.42 Jocquad was a store called Jocquad store and this is where you can represent your
02:17:07.42 --> 02:17:12.38 apparel while you're on the path maintaining your advantage competitively.
02:17:12.38 --> 02:17:16.70 We have shirts and hoodies and hats. They all say disciplinicals freedom or
02:17:16.70 --> 02:17:23.18 something along those lines. Good. Good. Same thing in a way. Kind of part of this.
02:17:23.18 --> 02:17:25.50 Anyway, you understand what I'm saying?
02:17:25.50 --> 02:17:28.98 Good stuff on there. There's a T-shirt club called this shirt locker.
02:17:28.98 --> 02:17:32.22 S-H-U-S. Thank you to whoever made that suggestion.
02:17:32.22 --> 02:17:36.62 Yeah, that's a good one. It was a lot better than the other name that we had been
02:17:36.62 --> 02:17:39.66 using here. The thing is to be honest, like the more I think about it, the
02:17:39.66 --> 02:17:42.70 shirt locker is like it didn't even matter what the name was before.
02:17:42.70 --> 02:17:45.14 That one would probably be better because it's like perfect.

02:18:53.58 --> 02:18:59.34 We don't want to do that. We definitely don't want to have anyone critiquing how certain
02:18:59.34 --> 02:19:06.82 people on this podcast talk about the items that are discussed.
