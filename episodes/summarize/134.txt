I'm tapping out in the sense at the end of the day you always ring the bell to the community they're like I'll get quit it quit her um and uh you know I had one last good deployment with a different group it was awesome work with these guys and um you know there's a lot of things you're not one I finally felt the fatigue um and the hardest thing to do for any seals to dab out but it's because you know that you're no longer like the best guy to push that uniform and and I also was going through divorce at the time and um things were just you know things were out of balance and even though I wanted to take the XO of a squadron um I knew I was not the best option for the guys and uh even though I could probably maintain the job that's not the right answer if I could not keep them uncomfortable and different forward then then I wasn't the right guy and I know there's there's a problem with that's getting out especially seals they're not getting jobs commensurate with their abilities and company should be swallowing these guys up leaders I mean the one thing you can't deny is the military is the preeminent leadership training platform in the nation motivating it not saying to the world if I be the world I'm not saying there's not great leaders out there that have not been the military actually they're they're they're more than than than people like the they there's a lot of great leaders and never had military training but as a whole and as you said about the Marine Corps they tend to turn out this this this standard product which is a kind of button the same thing with the military general and so uh you know talking down on the craving and a great guy named uh who is this vice chancellor major general Tony Kukuhu and this guy's become a real big matter in the um love them we talked about this and uh basically walked myself into a project which we got approved by the McComb's business school 20 vets we we did a analysis into the systemic challenges facing veterans when they get out in terms of employment and it was a you know 60 page paper which was met with quite a better reception and then again walking myself into more work everyone's like and so that's why we the companies we work up with that we work with up there we know that they need this and so that's why we're doing this one in San Francisco October 17th and 18th come on out you can register to extremotorship.com you'll see that on this one you'll see like a lot of people from the last one because they're like keep coming you know me because not only the updates or whatever but just like how you're saying earlier where the more okay you learn something then you go to the field you know you practice you you know practice you perform thing you're like he wants an outcome for you a good outcome for you more than you do I know that doesn't seem possible but for him to come and ask me to like talk to you means that what he wants more than anything in the world is for you to be in a good place in the future that's what he wants he doesn't want to screw you over this isn't a plot to get you to fail in life he actually wants you to win more than anything so you may want to listen to them check so it's at this point you do you do so what do you had you did nine deployments overseas total ten nine ten deployments overseas and and finally the little voice in your head says you know what I need to uh look at something else probably probably the toughest decision uh I had to make I mean a lot of guys like a lot of guys thought you were a thirty year that easy he's easy to do a thirty probably more and they usually say the same about me So if if a guy is seemingly getting gangged up on you know like if everyone's like hey you're not pulling your wig you know everyone's getting frustrated and then everyone's like harping on one guy that makes them quit way quicker than if like everyone's like but he used to call me that um and he said I understand what he wanted to do it's like you want to go to uh uh Memphis and like working the details shop I said no hey get me orders to to Texas my my XO's probably moved back to Texas that's where she's from and I want to be close to my kids I need to repair that relationship um and you've talked about it you know family is come second bottom line when you're at war you have so many responsibilities on you one Ranger guys whom that the the family is coming second and so that that was my new priority and so you test him into the CL community they they made things happen they realign things and they got me a billet at the University of Texas Naval ROTC um where one uh Admiral William McRaven was sitting as the uh the UT chancellor boom right there's no it no longer is a thing to wear it used to be like if you wore a black ghee you're like hey look everyone is like look at me right now no one gave it to cares what color because there's a lot of those different colors in circulation so whereas a year ago i'm saying only a year ago i would have been like hey listen you need to just stick with the white ghee that's just how right now the might have been open if you want to get a black ghee if that's the one that is is you know what you're into our company origin american made stuff geese rash got for jiu jitsu other stuff as well a peril why does it pair will get like a like a tone you know because you know how you get you know with the whole like a peril like you're not a fashion person They give us about five minutes and then, uh, rustists in the surgery and, uh, you know, next thing I know I wake up in, uh, Baghdad and, uh, go through another procedure and then prep to get the metavac to Germany, to, to go through another procedure and, um, the great thing is, you know, got other sealants I were together in the entire time that gave us two, uh, seals to escort us and, um, you know, Germany, we're there for I think three days and just people kept this and then visiting it. yeah, you know, I need to qualify this, you know, getting the try that was one of the biggest things, uh, one of the biggest accomplishments in my life, but they, it was just like a different sense of pride than who most rates up there that this bad ass, with Denny Colonel, that, that it been, you know, in the sock for so long, uh, bestowed a infamous, you know, uh, symbol on our shoulders and said, hey, you wear this in combat. right like how would you ever know what it's like to deal with a school teacher you know what to deal with a coach how would you know what that's like to deal with another person you know what you're And it was just, even that, like I remember that's so vividly, and I think, in a, in a, in a subtle way, like I held that against my daughter for, for a short while, um, it's like it was just like, it was almost like a shunning, like she knew what happened. and you know my fiance sees a different person because yeah for for the listeners I took a you know high level job in higher education executive director of veteran services for the tech say name system and it just you know even though the work was rewarding it just wasn't the same as being part of the actual front in like jorn has seen she's like you're actually like how did it get out of bed in the morning now no I don't understand your business I understand leadership that's what that's what Eschalon front we understand leaders so we can go in and look at what's going on and say oh you've got a leadership problem here and here's how we fix it and so to take that and say you know what we can actually give you people that understand leadership and they can help you solve these problems that is like you said Reese's peanut butter cup peanut butter and chocolate that's what it is so it's been on speaking of bringing on talent like when this whole thing was going down I'm like how if I can move mics are really attached along from because guess what that's what we did yeah bring bring the band back together yeah with the boys that makes a big difference and like you said you can't even shut us up like we will have a like we we got this thing called the tank where we'll get together and talk about like a leader like for working with three companies and there'll be leadership issues at each one of the companies but we and we never thought about hey what about joint supplements you know like you know when you're young you're like a cool maybe for like older folks or something like this how do you balance between being too much of a micromanager and being to lose how do you how do you manage the being communicating too much with the group and too little with how do you do how do you manage being too close to your people or to distant from your people so all those little things all those little balances that you have to figure out as a leader there in that book check it out you can preorder it anywhere if you preorder it's helpful because that way our publisher who is you know just not aware they're not in the game they're not listening to actually some of you know what we need to print a bunch of these books don't miss out on the first edition you know what the second edition might end up with it if you don't order it but and speaking of which for leadership training if you read the book you need a little bit more inside your organization echelon front we saw problems through leadership it's me late babbin jpe to know Dave Burke flint cauldron and now as you've heard my brother Mike's are Ellie monster 006 monster 006 in San Francisco October 17th and and I'm just like dude what is going on like I gave one speech and like people were like did you that actually you're perspective as I'll re-change my life I'm like well I'm glad to hear that I'm not saying you didn't realize the the impact but when you lose 31 that is just you know that that hits the military to to to the listeners they may say well 31 soldiers you know you guys can easily recover from that you can't all the the man hours that go into to training those guys the level of proficiency they had crude over years like that is like that is a catastrophic failure or you know detriment to the military that is a loss of a lot of capability I yet alone the pain for those 31 families the children the or not the orphans but the kids that are left behind the wives that are left behind and and that will never have any solace other than that their level ones were doing what they believed in for them defending them but no the work is you know fathers come up to me and be like hey can you talk to my son really loves you want to be a seal I what can you leave him with listen to your old man he may not know what the right decision is or right path is uncertain things but he will tell you what the wrong path is sometimes knowing what not to do it says valuable is knowing what to do you know what else I tell when when fathers ask me to talk to their sons I tell the sons I say listen your dad actually cares about you more than you do he and so you know we talk about brutal self-assessments that was the most brutal self-assessment because I had in that that all you know however good I thought I was and what we did what we did it just I'd come to a point where things were to go rating and so uh you know over overseas I actually called back to uh you know my my CEO at the time I said I'm done and uh this had and I was definitely it's funny because like when you're talking about like like I there's a lot of buddy carrying going on when I was running training and the reason is because I got the debrief you know like it's and and there's another weird thing about this whole deal this whole deal is that it's so hard to someone's got to have a real open mind to be able to teach it to people you know someone's got to be when someone's got to have an open mind like I would say when I was running trade at I would say like 30 or 40% of the people would be like listening and absorbing and which is important which is pretty good hey I remember you telling me that every company you talked to is like we're gonna get like five of you and that just wasn't your game at the time but at the end of the day you know talent is all about leadership becoming a talent magnet or having a talent mindset within your organization is about leadership and so you know knowing our communities the special operations community and combat aviators they broke your resident fighter pilot the badass that you um that could deal day we knew we could start something Yeah, that was, in the second month, and then she's going, like, I'm used to being with mom, but, uh, just, just being at the funeral and everything and just looking at all, you know, watching all the seals there, they took, you know, uh, to celebrate my ex life, it, it just, it felt like the eyes were on me, too. but we called Seth in and the whole I do remember this about Seth is as the strikers come in strikers are it's like an armored version of a humvee with wheels that can carry more troops than a humvee larger and they have some pretty good armament and weapon systems and the ramp lowers and Seth runs off and starts firing into a building and of course it's that's how he's like let's go get on the strikers and the guy start loading up and the strikers are getting after it to the point where they went winch after getting his out of there and one of the striker operators says hey give me your gun and I hand him my SR25 and he just starts going at it my hand him my last maggy reloads and he's just getting to after it well tell you what humbling experience put us back into the same position like a new guy in the body Sometimes it did, uh, most often we would infiltrate at night prior to, uh, you know, use the advantage of, uh, of night to you, to, to your unit, uh, set up prior to the, uh, the conventional's coming in the early morning and starting the, uh, the clearance operations, and then we, you could pull out during the day or stay until night, just to, uh, give ourselves, uh, you know, mitigate risk as best possible. and I would literally feel like a sickness in my stomach like a pit like just like when I was in the body if you'd see someone in the street you'd like to get out of the street I would have that feeling and you know people people often say like well how how are the seals like sent on a miswin business I'm like you just said it you're a unit you're a company you're dealing with people you deal with the same issues and it has been great I mean how long have I been on now three months and you know when I started that there was a lot of business matters in mind very successful business matters that are like duty needed capitalized this thing and at the time I couldn't see it like my ultra is I'm sort of drove like no it needs to be non-profit where you're not okay charged people for this see which kind of goes the you think it's kind of intuitive to his whole thing you know it's like hey let's make something that's like you know healthy good protein clean all this stuff but what's also interesting is that at the tail end of that the shakes inside solder city came out and said hey look we're good like we're here to make friends now we're done with this and what was really awesome was it solder city had been a complete nightmare for five straight years I mean solder city was completely uncontrollable and then in a six week period give or take that the those operations took place it was like done it was like they the the shakes came out and said yep
