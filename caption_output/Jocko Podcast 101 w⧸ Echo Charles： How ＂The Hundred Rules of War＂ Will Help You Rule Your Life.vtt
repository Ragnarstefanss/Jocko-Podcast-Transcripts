00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 101.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Second Lieutenant Bernard Wilfrid Long was a smart young man

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
who went to Birmingham University at age of 16.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Back in 1912.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He was commissioned in the West Yorkshire Regiment

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in January of 1916.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And Bernard or burn, as his family called him,

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
served in World War I in France.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And he wrote this letter to his father in early August of 1916.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He said,

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we've been having it awfully wet here during the last day or two.

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And my word, talk about mud.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's simply awful.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I get into mud up to my knees.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I can take a sporting risk as well as any of them.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And shells have got no fear for me.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I've seen great big burly chaps who do nothing but curse and drink

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and get down and pray like a child when there's a bombardment on.

22
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And they don't care who sees them and no one dares to joke about it.

23
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've just heard from a palamine from Brockton who went down to the som

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
when I came here and he says he's been over the lids seven times

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in attacks on the boge line.

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Pretty awful that, isn't it?

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And I marvel. He's alive to tell the tale.

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He wrote another letter to his mother on August 11, 1917.

29
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I am off by an early train tomorrow for the rest of Bill.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's behind the firing line where we shall be for a time to get to know our men.

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Etc.

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I am going up with two pals and we are all pleased.

33
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I shall think of you all while I'm up there and know you won't forget me.

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We're fighting hard now and it's a serious game.

35
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We're already to lay down everything if need be.

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And if God wills, I'm ready.

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So goodbye and wish me luck.

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You're loving son, burn.

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And second lieutenant Bernard Wilford Long was killed in action at age 21.

40
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
At the Battle of Langmark on August 16, 1917,

41
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
400 men from his battalion went into action.

42
00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:04.000
All 10 of the officers from the battalion died along with 264 of the men.

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
On September 11, 1918,

44
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
there's another young man, Sergeant David Kerr, an American who dropped out of Columbia University to fight in World War I.

45
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He sent a letter to his mother the day before the attack on St. Miel in France.

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he wrote, tomorrow the first totally American drive commences and it gives me inexpressible joy and pride to know that I shall be present to do my share.

47
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Should I go under, therefore, I want you to know that I went without any terror of death.

48
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And that my chief worry is the grief, my death will bring to those so dear to me.

49
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Since having found myself and Mary, there has been much to make life sweet and glorious.

50
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But death, while this tasteful, is in no way terrible.

51
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I feel wonderfully strong to do my share well.

52
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And for my sake, you must try to drown your sorrow in the pride and satisfaction.

53
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The knowledge that I died well and so clean a cause as his arms should bring you.

54
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Remember how proud I have always been of your superb pluck.

55
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Keep Elizabeth's future in mind and don't permit my death to bow your head.

56
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
My personal belongings will all be sent to you.

57
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Your good taste will tell you which to send to Mary.

58
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
May God bless and keep you dear heart and be kind to little Elizabeth and those others I loved so well.

59
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
David, the end.

60
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And while the Americans actually broke through the German lines in the attack,

61
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:29.000
they suffered 7,000 casualties in 72 hours of fighting and 20 year old David Kerr was among the dead.

62
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And that attitude that attitude where death is not feared.

63
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We can find examples of it in so many different places.

64
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
A great example is from the American Civil War,

65
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
from a man by the name of Sullivan, Baloo.

66
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, after the Battle at Fort Sumper, in 1861, President Lincoln called on the states to form up militia troops to put down the rebellion.

67
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And Sullivan Baloo, who was born in Rhode Island, was one of those volunteers.

68
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And he was commissioned a major in the second Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.

69
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
He was third in command.

70
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And the second Rhode Island Infantry Regiment moved to Washington and joined the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia.

71
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And on the 14th of July 1861, from Washington, Sullivan wrote his wife a letter.

72
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And here are some excerpts from that letter.

73
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
My very dear Sarah, the indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps tomorrow.

74
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Last I should not be able to write you again.

75
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

76
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure.

77
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And it may be one of severe conflict and death to me.

78
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Not my will, but vine, oh God, be done.

79
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If it is necessary that I should fall in the battlefield for my country, I am ready.

80
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter.

81
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I know how strongly American civilization now leans upon the triumph of the government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the revolution.

82
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I am willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this government, and to pay that debt.

83
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys, I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows.

84
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.000
When, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children.

85
00:08:43.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle and fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country?

86
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night when 2,000 men are sleeping around me. Many of them enjoying their last perhaps before that of death.

87
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I, suspicious that death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart and communing with God, my country, and you.

88
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000
From my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but the omnipotence could break.

89
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Then yet, my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with these chains to the battlefield.

90
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:05.000
The memories of blissful moments I've spent with you come creeping over me. And I feel most gratified to God and to you that I've enjoyed them so long.

91
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes, the hopes of future years when God willing we might still have lived and love together and seen our sons grow up honorable to manhood around us.

92
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And I know but few small claims upon divine providence but something whispered to me. Perhaps it is wafted, perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed.

93
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you. And when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

94
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Forgive my many faults in the many pains I have caused you. How fottless and foolish I have oftentimes been, how gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness and struggle with all the misfortune of this world to shield you and my children from harm.

95
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But I cannot, I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you while you buff at the storms with your precious little freight and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

96
00:11:41.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oh Sarah, if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love I shall always be near you. In the garish day and in the darkest night amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours always.

97
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek it shall be my breath or if cool air fans your throbbing temple it shall be my spirit passing by.

98
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Sarah do not mourn me dead think I am gone and wait for thee for we shall meet again. As for my little boys they will grow as I have done and never know a father's love and care.

99
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Little Willie is too young to remember me long and my blue eye to Edgar will keep my frolics with him amongst the dimmest memories of his childhood.

100
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Sarah I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters.

101
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I call God's blessing upon them. Oh Sarah I wait for you there.

102
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And lead to me and lead thither my children Sullivan.

103
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And on July 21st 1861 the regiment took part in the first battle of bull run.

104
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And as one of the senior officers Sullivan went in front on horse back to direct his men and he was hit by a cannon ball that tore off his right leg and also killed his horse.

105
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And he died from his wound a week after the battle while the prisoner of the Confederate army at age 32.

106
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And again an individual obviously prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. And we know that the enemy can be equally prepared to die.

107
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Clearly from the Kamakaze pilots from Japan in World War II. One of those young Kamakaze pilots was named Yukiyo Araki.

108
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And he was a member of the 72nd Shinbu Squadron. And he wrote this letter Dear Father and Mother.

109
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I trust you and my brothers are doing well recently.

110
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
It has been decided that I will go at last to take part in the Battle of Okinawa as a member of the Special Attack Forces.

111
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I am deeply moved. I only look forward to sinking a ship with a single blow.

112
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
When I look back I apologize for not being devoted to you in any way for some ten years to this day.

113
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Through teaching by various senior officers after I entered the army I now devote myself to my country as a Special Attack Force member.

114
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Please find pleasure in your desire for my loyalty to the Emperor and devotion to parents.

115
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I have no regrets. I just go forward on my path.

116
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I ask that you teach my three brothers so they can serve our country as noble airmen.

117
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I sincerely hope that you take good care of yourselves and make strunnures efforts on the home front.

118
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Please give my regards to all my relatives and to everyone in the neighborhood association.

119
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Sayonara.

120
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Yukiyo Araki.

121
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And he did indeed die at the age of 17 in the suicide attack on American ships near Okinawa on May 27, 1945.

122
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And the Japanese also imposed their willingness to die on their people.

123
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And here is a description of that brutal imposition from American sailors from the Journal of an American Sailor named James Fahey,

124
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
who served on the USS Montpire in the Pacific.

125
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And this is what he wrote on November 10, 1943.

126
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
This afternoon we came across a raft with four live japs in it.

127
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000
As the destroyer Spence came close to the raft, the japs opened up with machine gun at the destroyer.

128
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
The jap officer then put the gun in each man's mouth and fired,

129
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
blowing out the back of each man's skull.

130
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
One of the japs did not want to die for the Emperor and put up a struggle.

131
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
The others held him down.

132
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
The officer was the last to die.

133
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
He also blew his brains out.

134
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
The Spence went into investigate.

135
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
All the bodies had disappeared into the water.

136
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
There was nothing left but blood at an empty raft.

137
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Swarms of sharks everywhere.

138
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
The sharks ate well today.

139
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
We went to battle stations.

140
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And at 10pm we were attacked by enemy planes.

141
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Later darkness descended.

142
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And the rains came.

143
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And just coming off the episode that we did.

144
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
With Musashi who obviously overcame his fear of death.

145
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And I got a book in the mail from Japan.

146
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And the book was called The Hundred Rules of War.

147
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It's from someone in Japan named Eric.

148
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Eric Shahhan, who turned out to be the actual translator of this book.

149
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And he's translated a bunch of other Japanese books on martial arts.

150
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And he asked me if this book The Hundred Rules of War.

151
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
If any of the rules inside this book apply to modern warfare.

152
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And I read through the book and I read the book.

153
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And it came to a very clear answer that yes.

154
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Not only do many of the rules in the book apply to modern warfare.

155
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
They also apply to life in general like many of the rules that I talk about.

156
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And this book The Hundred Rules of War, which by the way only has 97 rules in it.

157
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
But the book was originally written by Sukahara.

158
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Book would end.

159
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Who lived from 1489 to 1571.

160
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So that's actually before Musashi's lifetime.

161
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Because Musashi was born.

162
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
They say in 1584.

163
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So this book predates Musashi.

164
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And there's actually multiple revisions on this book.

165
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
It's interesting people would get it and add something to it over the years.

166
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
There was a forward written to the book in the mid 1600s.

167
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
By Takawan Soho.

168
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And then there was an after-word written by one of the grandchildren of Boca-den students.

169
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And there's another section.

170
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
The first eight lines in the book that were added.

171
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And those are attributed to Shogun Yoshimune.

172
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And he's a Shogun that ruled the Japan from 1716 until 1745.

173
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So this book is very interesting.

174
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And since Eric who sent it to me is obviously fluent in Japanese.

175
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I'll apologize of course for my bad Japanese pronunciation.

176
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
But we'll go for it.

177
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I'll want to take you through some of the sections of this book that again,

178
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I feel not only applied to combat today, but to life today.

179
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And interestingly, here's the, we'll start off a little bit with the introduction.

180
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And this is again written by, written after the original book came out.

181
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And this guy added this introduction to it.

182
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And he's describing how great the book is.

183
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
It's a little bit of arrogance in this, but it's okay.

184
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Because he's saying hey, he's not saying he wrote it.

185
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
He's saying look, this book is important.

186
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And here we go to the book.

187
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
If you change out the people, if you change out the words, if you change out the places,

188
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
and if you change out every generation, it is like the difference between rain,

189
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
do snow and ice.

190
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
They reach you for them to buy the same water.

191
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
That's interesting.

192
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Right? Because now we're talking about people.

193
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Hey, you can be different times, different places, different surroundings.

194
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
But it's like the difference between rain and dew and snow and ice.

195
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
It's the same water, the same people are the same.

196
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Back to the book.

197
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
These words should be read by any and everyone who follows the way of the warrior.

198
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Speak them aloud so that you may hear them in your ears and fail to heed them at your peril.

199
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
They're not simply words to rever and praise.

200
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
If you are attempting to equate the teachings within this scroll to any other work,

201
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
know that this is knowledge that can be found only after summoning the tallest peak of a mountain.

202
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
The depth of the wisdom contained on these pages makes the sea seem shallow by comparison.

203
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000
If you were a compare person, versed in these ideas to a stone, you would find the latter soft by comparison.

204
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Pull a bowstring, launching an arrow, or pulling a bowstring, launching an arrow, raising your whip,

205
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
encouraging your steed, dawning your armor, taking up your lance, gaining fame and honor,

206
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
becoming one who starts a great house, read this book, listen to it.

207
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Understand the unmistakable truths.

208
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
It would be utterly foolish to not lock them in your mind.

209
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
In my opinion, even if you lived through a hundred generations over a thousand years,

210
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000
coming across another book like this, would be like to a blind turtle who comes to the surface once every hundred years,

211
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
climbing its way into a hole on a piece of driftwood.

212
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I like that.

213
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Now, as we jump into this book, there's one more thing I need to mention.

214
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I said that there's these additions kind of to the book over time.

215
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Well, one of the additions to the book, I mean, this book is written in the 1500s,

216
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
but one of the additions to the book, and this is something that Eric added,

217
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:24.000
that he found a translation of the book by a researcher and a practitioner of the sword arts.

218
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And this guy's name was Hori Shogi, and he produced the text, and he put little helpful interpretations,

219
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
kind of furthering the idea a little bit.

220
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
So I'll read those sometimes because it gives a little bit of clearification as to what's being talked about.

221
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And these first eight lines are actually, I'll give it up for these first eight lines in this book being fairly epic, fairly epic.

222
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And again, these were written by Tokugawa Shogun Yishimuni.

223
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And again, he was the Shogun ruler of Japan from 1716 to 1745, and here's what he added to the book.

224
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I think these are, well, here's number one, you cannot have pleasure without pain, and you cannot have pain without pleasure.

225
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Your struggles now will be rewarded in the future, so you must endure.

226
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Right?

227
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Yes.

228
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Kind of speaks for itself, does it not?

229
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:46.000
In fact, I think we call that discipline, it goes freedom. Next, be reverent towards the law, be afraid of fire, be afraid of thoughtless,

230
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
dedlusional people, and never forget to be reverent to those you owe a debt of gratitude to.

231
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
This is one of those things that what do we say now, never forget where you came from, right? People say never forget where you came from.

232
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
So don't forget those people that got you there, because where you came from, somebody helped you along the way.

233
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:14.000
And so don't forget about that. Next one, you should think of greed and lust as the enemy.

234
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Hmm, concur. I think I like this one. You should neither sleep late nor talk too long. Now, I guess I'm kind of the talk too long.

235
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I may be violating that on the regular basis, at least once a week on a podcast.

236
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Yes, me too sometimes.

237
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Actually, you might violate that on the regular.

238
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000
But here's the guy, don't sleep late. And you know, I get this all the, every time I, every time somebody talks to me about sleeping, someone says,

239
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Why have the night shift or while I work late, my kids don't go to bed until midnight. Okay, I get it.

240
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I'm not saying everyone in the world has to wake up at 430.

241
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Yeah, what I'm saying is that you shouldn't sleep late, right? And if you work at night shift, not sleeping late might be waking up at noon, right?

242
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Yeah, but you didn't oversleep as my point.

243
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Yeah, it's the idea just like I said, like, we all want to like stay cozy and are been and kind of take our time.

244
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Right, yeah, it's the idea for sure. That's what I get from anyway.

245
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000
It's not the mandatory. Yeah, 430. And if you don't wake up at 430, you're black or something. Yeah, like someone someone, someone,

246
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
So I had picture my hand on the interweb, right? And I had a little callos get removed. Sure on the pull up bar.

247
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And I'm the pull up bar. Yeah, but someone someone said, Hey, if someone doesn't have callos, they don't work out.

248
00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And then someone else said, Well, what if you run a marathon, he still work out. And so, you know, it's the point is get some right kids can you get some while training for a marathon? Yes,

249
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Can you get some on a run your marathon? Yes, you can look at look at Rob Jones.

250
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Yeah, he just ran 31 marathon. Yeah, everyone days. Yeah, that's getting some. We're not accusing him of not working.

251
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Yeah, Matt, it is lack of callos. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right, next.

252
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Take care to organize even trivial things. Then if something major occurs, it will not catch you off guard.

253
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So that's the little things that matter. Attention. You know, you're not doing no military. We need to join the military. I joke about it. They make you fold your underwear in like a four by four inch square.

254
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And that's the thing. They're trying to teach you attention to detail because actually I was talking to Marine buddy mine. I think it was, I want to say it was Morgan.

255
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Yeah, and they were, they landed their hellow and the gunner, whoever was in charge of the weapon, cracked off a 50 cow round into the, well, so you have a 50 cow

256
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:08.000
mounted in the helicopter, guy cracked off around he, if a weapon gets hot, it can just shoot. Okay. Yeah, yeah, if a weapon is really hot, it's called a cook off.

257
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
You've got a round in the chamber and the weapon's hot and it can just make that round go off from what the what anything.

258
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Just well, no from hot. If it's hot, well, you're shooting it. Okay, if it's hot inside then you add you shoot it a bunch. And now it gets hot. There's a hot round sitting in the chamber.

259
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah, and a minute goes by or you can know him. You know how long it's going to be. It could be five minutes, but boom, all of a sudden it just fires.

260
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Yeah, and this, so before in this particular case, I'm not sure the weapon system, it was a 50 cow. But I'm not sure where they had it mounted.

261
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
But anyways, he should have cleared it before he folded it up into the helicopter and he didn't do that.

262
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And so he pulled the rounds out, but there's one round sitting in the chamber and sure enough it cooked off. So that's the kind of thing where they're trying to get you to pay attention to the small details.

263
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Yeah.

264
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
The trivial things.

265
00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Yeah.

266
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Because the trivial things aren't too trivial.

267
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Yeah, did they do they explain that to you? Like when you're folding you underwear, do they explain, okay, then you know, that all they do.

268
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:20.000
They do, and I've talked about this before on the podcast that my drone instructor in, in Officer candidate school. At the end of Officer candidate school, he explained why on everything.

269
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
At the end.

270
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
At the end.

271
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Oh, like Mr. Mayaldi.

272
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
No, no, of course.

273
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
No, while you're doing it though, they'll be saying, how can you, you can't even fold your underwear, not right. How can we trust you with a weapon system?

274
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Yeah.

275
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
They'll say that kind of thing to you.

276
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:44.000
But you don't really, when you're, when I was going through regular boot camp, you're just, you're, your mind is being transformed from civilian world to military world. So you're not, you don't have good perspective.

277
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Yeah.

278
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
You know, you're like weapon system man.

279
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
I just want to eat the next meal.

280
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Yeah.

281
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
You're, you're not, you can't see the big picture.

282
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
I mean, I, I couldn't. I was too young or too dumb or a little bit of both.

283
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Yeah.

284
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
But they do. They're saying, hey, how could you, how could you, how could you trust, how could you,

285
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
how could you, fly an airplane, if you can't even fold your underwear right, boy.

286
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
You're, you're actually thinking, well, damn, maybe I shouldn't be flying an airplane.

287
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I can't fold my underwear right.

288
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Yeah.

289
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
But they're trying to teach you attention to detail. And it is good.

290
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And it does apply to everything.

291
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
You know, it does apply to everything.

292
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And you do the little things right. And that way, the little things are in order.

293
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And that means the big things, even if they catch a little off guard, you're at least prepared for it.

294
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Yeah.

295
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Yeah. That whole thing, I mean, I, I dig it, you know, how they're talking to you guys like that.

296
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
But that whole thing where, how do you expect to do this when you can't even, you know, tire shoes right or whatever, you know, like,

297
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
like, say, or you don't bind to that, I don't know.

298
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I do.

299
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
What I, I don't know.

300
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
It's good.

301
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
You're like, how are you going to, because a lot of things, it's like a false little equivalency there.

302
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Something, there's telling you to pay attention a little thing.

303
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

304
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
I get attention to detail.

305
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I get that part of it for sure.

306
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
But I'm saying, like, if it's, hey, they're not explaining why.

307
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I don't, and it could be wrong.

308
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Well, they're explaining why, but they're doing it.

309
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
They're not doing, they're not breaking it down.

310
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Right.

311
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You know, like a school teacher is right.

312
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Okay. Well, this is echo Charles.

313
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Let me tell you why this is important.

314
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
I'm not doing that.

315
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Yeah.

316
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
That's something like that.

317
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
No, they're not, they're saying, hey, they're, they're getting it.

318
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Yeah.

319
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
How can we trust you with a rifle if you can't fall during the war right?

320
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Yeah.

321
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Okay.

322
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And, and I would say this, maybe I didn't see the big picture, but I at least saw the little picture.

323
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Yeah.

324
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, that's, you know, the thing ultimately, like, you know, like, and I mentioned,

325
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Mr. Mia, like, uncrout credit kit, right?

326
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Where he's like, wax on wax off.

327
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
You know, and he's like, oh, this is so dumb then at the end, he gets the picture, you know,

328
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
but as he's doing it, I mean, he didn't say, you know, if you can't send the floor,

329
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
how are you going to, why then the term, and nothing like that?

330
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Well, he was teaching him some kind of technique allegedly.

331
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Right.

332
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
But that's essentially what they're doing as far as attention to detail.

333
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
They're making you do all these little, you did, too.

334
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
That would make you, there's nothing.

335
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff that's there in foot lock pieces of wood.

336
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Yeah, but that's pretty, like, that's an obvious translation, you know, like,

337
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
like, I'm gonna foot lock something.

338
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
It's like punching a punching bag, you know, same thing.

339
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Yeah.

340
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Through just two.

341
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
First check.

342
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
All right, going to the next one.

343
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
90% is not enough.

344
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Only 100% will keep disaster at bay.

345
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
That's good.

346
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Now, of course, many times, I'll say, hey, 80, you got an 80% solution.

347
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Go.

348
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Right.

349
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Yeah.

350
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Because people sit around and wait for the right hand.

351
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Good plan now.

352
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Which, so I think that's a little bit different, but this, I think if you're talking about effort,

353
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
yeah.

354
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Right.

355
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
The effort has to be 100%.

356
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Yeah.

357
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
We're not gonna give 100%.

358
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And it's a settling thing, too, right?

359
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
You know, people like, you don't, don't, like, set, you know, don't tell

360
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
for 90%.

361
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
But it's 100% is required.

362
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Exactly.

363
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Yeah.

364
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
That's what I get from it.

365
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Next, having good judgment also means being able to endure.

366
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
There you go.

367
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
In your take pain.

368
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And it's not just pain.

369
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
It's also being able to take just, just, just, just, just, just comfort.

370
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
And just comfort.

372
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Like, like, how many people don't want to do a job, just because it's, just because it's

373
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
grueling and not fun.

374
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Yeah.

375
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Right.

376
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Right here.

377
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
A lot of people fall back at a point.

378
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Not right now currently, obviously, but, you know, in general, yeah, that's my channel.

379
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I had a tooth from for the most part.

380
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Sometimes.

381
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
What was the worst, most medial job that you really hated?

382
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
My worst job that I really hated was being a mover at American whippers on a wall

383
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
and a hole in a hole.

384
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
For the summer, but then you get a little bit.

385
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
What?

386
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Like, like, hey, man, I'm gonna move this thing really fast.

387
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
No.

388
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
No, not at all.

389
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
It was like, moving.

390
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
And for other people all day, like, and it was bad as like 13 hours a day, average.

391
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
I work on.

392
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
I, every time I, when I work construction and the first day on the job site, the, the guys

393
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
came into the Wendy's.

394
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
I work at Wendy's.

395
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Sure.

396
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
And the guys looked at me and the, in this, all the time guy, builder.

397
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
He looks at me goes, what are you doing here?

398
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
And I said, I'm making rent.

399
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
He says, you want to work here?

400
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I said, no, sir.

401
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
He said, you want to work construction with me?

402
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I said, yes, sir.

403
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
He said, but report tomorrow, wherever a cracker they were building the place right across

404
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
the street.

405
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Yeah.

406
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I said, yes, sir.

407
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So I showed up there in the morning.

408
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
And there was a dump truck had come with a ton of concrete block to, that we're going to build

409
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
a little foundation wall.

410
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And they just dumped it, you know, 100 yards away.

411
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
All these concrete blocks.

412
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Yeah.

413
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And he says, hey, your job today is to move these blocks.

414
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Over to get them over here near the foundation thing.

415
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And he said, we're going to get some coffee and some donuts.

416
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Sure.

417
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Yeah.

418
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Donuts.

419
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
So I said, yes, sir.

420
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And he got in the truck with the guys, right?

421
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
And I started moving these blocks.

422
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I was running.

423
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
I was running.

424
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Literally running as fast as I could possibly do it.

425
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
And I wasn't even doing that as like a challenge to myself.

426
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I was so happy to not be working at Wendy's.

427
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Yeah.

428
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
That I would have, I mean, I just was filled with energy.

429
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
So I can get all these blocks done.

430
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
And another guy was there who didn't go to get coffee donuts.

431
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And he kind of gave me, hey, man, you need to slow down.

432
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Yeah.

433
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
You know, you're going to make him look bad.

434
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
And I would just say, hey, I'm going pretty slow.

435
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
And I said, I said, I'll do whatever.

436
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
You know, I'll do your job.

437
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
You can sit there.

438
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
I don't care.

439
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
So, but what do you think of any of that?

440
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You didn't get any, I mean, you didn't pose little challenges to yourself.

441
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Yeah.

442
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.000
You're a little work crew.

443
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
That's actually how I got by.

444
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I was like, okay, let me do this.

445
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Because if there's a way to get by, you should tell people because some people are stuck in jobs

446
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
They don't like right at this moment in time.

447
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
They're listening to podcasts and they're working at Wendy's.

448
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Yeah.

449
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And I work at Wendy's.

450
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Bro.

451
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Yeah.

452
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
That was a lot of fun.

453
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
That was a fun locker.

454
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
That was a fun locker.

455
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
That was a fun.

456
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Worked at full luck.

457
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
But what is like that?

458
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
What is that?

459
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
What is that?

460
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
What is that?

461
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Like that?

462
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Yeah.

463
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
He knows funny men.

464
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
On quiet working at full luck was kind of, when you walk in, it'd be like,

465
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Hey, that's kind of cool.

466
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
You get to wear the ref uniform and all that.

467
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And the men, when we, we're in high school.

468
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Yeah.

469
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So, man, we start working.

470
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
I was like, this is, it's tedious.

471
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
It's weird how your perspective changes.

472
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Yeah.

473
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I was thinking about that the other day when you're a young team guy.

474
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
And you get like when I got my first apartment.

475
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I was, I'm a little man.

476
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Yeah.

477
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I was the richest guy in the world.

478
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Yeah.

479
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Yeah.

480
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I was the man.

481
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Yeah.

482
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
But then as you, you know, you settle into that.

483
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And then you say, well, you know what I need to buy.

484
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Cool.

485
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
That little house.

486
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
I like you got to be, be wary of the greed.

487
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
That's true.

488
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
That's true.

489
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
But that's natural though, right?

490
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
It's like, you don't when you get used to something.

491
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
It becomes the new standard.

492
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
You know how that whole thing works.

493
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Right.

494
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Well, okay.

495
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Then what's the difference between someone?

496
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Because you and I both know people.

497
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
There's people that get to the comfort zone and then they're done.

498
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
What's the difference between someone that gets the comfort zone and done?

499
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And someone that gets the comfort zone and says, alright, I'm comfortable here, but I want more.

500
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Yeah.

501
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Yeah.

502
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I want to do more.

503
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Maybe not want more because that implies a materialistic point.

504
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
But I just want more.

505
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Huh.

506
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Yeah.

507
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.000
I know.

508
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Because they're both like really like obviously prevalent in like almost natural.

509
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Yeah.

510
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
You can get both those personalities exist.

511
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Yeah.

512
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
But I'm sure we're all like, but we're both of that.

513
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
I'm sure everybody is both of those things in one way or another.

514
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
You know, like in, you know, like we're probably both in like the comfort zone big time as far as certain things.

515
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
You know, I don't know why the whole thing.

516
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
You know, I can't.

517
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
No, you know what's interesting.

518
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Yeah.

519
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Because if you think about it, you see someone that's got 70% body fat.

520
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Yeah.

521
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And you go dude.

522
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Yeah.

523
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
That dude's got 70% body fat.

524
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
That's got like that sucks.

525
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Like, yeah.

526
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
That person should work.

527
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
You know, trying to get that, trying to drop that percentage down.

528
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Yeah.

529
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
But there's someone that's looking at me.

530
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Some guy that's obsessed with being lean as hell.

531
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
He's looking at me like God.

532
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I can't believe chocolate's got whatever.

533
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Yeah.

534
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
20% or 18.

535
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Whatever my percent body fat is.

536
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Yeah.

537
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
He's looking at me going.

538
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Dude.

539
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Well, you know, I mean, so why am I comfort zone?

540
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
No, no, no, no, no.

541
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
I don't know.

542
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
No, no, no.

543
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Because it's not like you were getting after it.

544
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You're not after your body percent levels.

545
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
And then you had a certain number and then you were like,

546
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I don't care.

547
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
It's kind of thing.

548
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I don't think that that's a good way it went.

549
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Here's what have and not with you.

550
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Obviously, I can't speak as far as your comfort zones go.

551
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
But a typical one we'll say is that, you know,

552
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
guys will be working out and like getting their fresh hair cut or whatever.

553
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And then they'll get married and then they won't work out as much.

554
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
You guys girls whatever.

555
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
You know, and do that, they quote unquote let themselves go after they get married.

556
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Like that kind of stuff.

557
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
But they might focus a lot more on their career.

558
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And then they might want more of that.

559
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
But then, you know, it's like that kind of stuff.

560
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Yeah.

561
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
I think you gotta watch out for the comfort zone.

562
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Yeah, I need to go to.

563
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
All right.

564
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Next.

565
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Oh, now we've moved beyond those opening lines.

566
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And now we get into the bulk of the book book,

567
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
which again, which is written by this book again, guy.

568
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And here we go.

569
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
It does not matter whether you are filing firing at an enemy near you or an opponent.

570
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Some distance away, you should be a depth that's selecting the best arrowhead.

571
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
And then the, the amplification on that says the lesson here is that you need a strong arrow for an adversary at close range.

572
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
But a lighter one for hitting an opponent far away.

573
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
And I guess when I read this, the point that I got out of it was,

574
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
you, you need to be able to select your tools properly.

575
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Right.

576
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And as a leader, you need to be able to select.

577
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Think of all the tools we've talked about on this podcast that you need to use as a leader.

578
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Yeah.

579
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Some guys gotta be a little bit harsher with a guy.

580
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Sometimes you gotta be, you gotta flank a guy.

581
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Sometimes you gotta be directors.

582
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
All these different tools that you need to use as a leader.

583
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
You gotta be a depth that's selecting the right tools.

584
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
And I gave a metaphor on here one time about about

585
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
how, uh, you're like a woodworker, right?

586
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
This is actually what's interesting about the woodworker metaphor is as a leader.

587
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
You have to be like a woodworker, which means you need to learn all these different types of tools.

588
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
But you need to learn how to use these different tools on different types of wood.

589
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And each one of these types of wood, each one of these individual pieces of wood is a little bit different.

590
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
They got a little not, they got a grain, they get things.

591
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
So you, you can't just learn a mechanical skill.

592
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Yeah.

593
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
You have to learn to be a true craftsman with the tools.

594
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And then you have to learn about what the different types of people they are.

595
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
And then you have to see that each, even a different type, like this person might have a big ego.

596
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
But they got this other thing.

597
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
You know, they get a little different grain.

598
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Yeah.

599
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Kind of like a barber.

600
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You know, the barber cuts your hair.

601
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
You're the person using the clippers.

602
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Well, yeah.

603
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And you keep us up the thing and it depends, you know.

604
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Yeah.

605
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
That's true.

606
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Like a barber or I guess we could say any type of craftsmen that is to work with varying medium.

607
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Sure.

608
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Yeah, pretty much anybody really.

609
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Everybody.

610
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Everybody.

611
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
You've watched the social network, right?

612
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Watch that show.

613
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Sounds weird.

614
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
It's a, when you first hear the idea of Facebook, you both have about Facebook and Zuckerberg.

615
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
The first, when you hear about that, you're like, oh, who cares?

616
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
But probably that's a good movie.

617
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Really good movie.

618
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Anyway.

619
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
It's a movie.

620
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I thought it was a show movie.

621
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
A movie.

622
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Okay.

623
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
The social network.

624
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Is he awkward?

625
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Yeah.

626
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Yeah.

627
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
It's really, they overdo his awkwardness.

628
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Maybe.

629
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I don't know.

630
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
I don't really follow Zuckerberg to know his awkwardness or whatever.

631
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
But he ever heard people call him sucks.

632
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Yeah, sucks.

633
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Like that.

634
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
We can tell you the coffee sucks.

635
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
We're tied.

636
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Anyway.

637
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Yeah.

638
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Sure.

639
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
But he's doing something.

640
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
He's breaking into the college computer or mainframe.

641
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Whatever.

642
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
He's breaking into and he's kind of narrating what he's doing.

643
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
He's like, I had to do this.

644
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
So I break out this.

645
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
You know, and he's doing the same thing.

646
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
That was a really revealing part in regards to his kind of thing.

647
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Oh, he's got to make sure he's getting here because he's trying to solve these

648
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
for it.

649
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
It's all code and you know, so he's trying to solve this problem.

650
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
But then this problem comes out.

651
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
And then this one has these specific problems.

652
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So he has to solve them.

653
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
But he can't just deal with the current tools.

654
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
He has to bust out together.

655
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
The vision when he was creating it of of what it was going to be.

656
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Well, did he feel that confident about it?

657
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Did he see the whole vision or did he like wake up one day and say,

658
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Dang, this thing is going to be really long.

659
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
No, no.

660
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
It was like it was a slow evolution into it because at first it was like he started with this thing called

661
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Face Smash, which was basically just comparing the girls on campus like who's hotter.

662
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
And then you click, okay, she's hotter.

663
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Then he go to the next one.

664
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
She's hotter.

665
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
You know, and that's called buttocks.

666
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yes.

667
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And that was a big part of it.

668
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
It was like that's what people would hate them and stuff like that.

669
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
And then it just slowly, um, now it was a social network.

670
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
These guys.

671
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Like, we were like, what a teenager would do, right?

672
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Oh, yeah, big time.

673
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
And that's what they were trying to emphasize to more like he just wanted to be liked by people.

674
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
He made that.

675
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
I'm like, I thought that was going to help him be liked.

676
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
He didn't do your job.

677
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
He's not.

678
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
This is just what the moves that I don't know.

679
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
You know, I'm sure there's some inconsistencies with it.

680
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
But no, it's weird is it would be weird to meet him.

681
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
We're not just to meet him like, hey, nice to meet you, but to actually know him.

682
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I guess.

683
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Because then you see what someone's there's been there's been people that I've kind of known that we're

684
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
uh, whatever, so to say, my famous or whatever the word is.

685
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Sure.

686
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And in reality, like on TV, they seem like they're not cool people.

687
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
But in regular life, they're really cool.

688
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And then the opposite, I've also seen where someone is,

689
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
It seems super cool.

690
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
When you see their persona and then real life, they're not cool.

691
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah.

692
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Yeah.

693
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
I guess that'd be pretty common to kind of be inconsistent that way.

694
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Or have it be inconsistent as far as your experience with that person.

695
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Seems like they had to be kind of common.

696
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Right?

697
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Because a lot of people, if they're famous or if they're, you know,

698
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
famous, pop it whatever.

699
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
A lot of times you kind of got to turn it on for the camera, right?

700
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Especially because you're essentially a performer in one way or another,

701
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
whether it be actor or whoever, you know,

702
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
even like businessmen, you know, like it's weird.

703
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And it's not even necessarily a bad thing.

704
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It's more like for lack of a better term, a required thing.

705
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
You know, so like my brother, for example, like if I know him,

706
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
but then when I hear him talking to like,

707
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
I don't know exactly.

708
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Or like everyone's while he'll, I'll see him on like an interview or something.

709
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And I'm like, like, he, there's only because I know.

710
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I know.

711
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
So good.

712
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
So like I feel like just a lot of, uh, Joe Rogan.

713
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
So I actually met Joe Rogan.

714
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
A long time ago when I was just Dean's one of Dean's

715
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
cornermen, right? You know how Joe Rogan treated me back then?

716
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Oh, super cool.

717
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Like just like just the same.

718
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
I then when I was up on his podcast,

719
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
the same dude.

720
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
That's a good dude right there.

721
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
You know what I mean?

722
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
A green and strangely enough, I had the exact same experience.

723
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And this is, and this whole, this whole kind of demonstrate how legit

724
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
a minute it is, right?

725
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
So same exact story.

726
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I messed Joe Rogan for the first time with Dean and my wife.

727
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
We went to, we kind of knew Red Banner.

728
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
So we went to one of his shows.

729
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
We got to go to one of his shows and go talk to him afterwards, right?

730
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So that's the first day of Madame.

731
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Same thing.

732
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Super nice.

733
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Game is email.

734
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Yeah.

735
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
I'm like, sorry.

736
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
I'm just some dude.

737
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
He was like, yeah.

738
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Email this guy.

739
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Yeah.

740
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And then so the next time I see him was when I went to

741
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Legends to train.

742
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
When I was going to LA for, you know,

743
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I'd be performing.

744
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Then train at Legends.

745
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And so I go there and, um,

746
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
he's there.

747
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
He's rolling with everyone and everything.

748
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
You know, it's like he's known there or whatever.

749
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
You know, like, come, just another person there.

750
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
It's for his training us.

751
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
And then, um, so he's kind of cruising down the side.

752
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
So I'm going to go last something to roll.

753
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
So I was like, hey, what's up.

754
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Yeah, I met you with Dean long time ago.

755
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
You know, a few years ago, whatever.

756
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
It's like he was like, yeah,

757
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I must have been a lot like he totally did it.

758
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Remember me, you know.

759
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
It's not like, I remember you.

760
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
So now I'm going to be cool to you.

761
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
It was like he did totally did it.

762
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Remember me.

763
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I was probably one of many people.

764
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And he was still just his cool.

765
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
So he starts talking about you.

766
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
You know how like you did.

767
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
You know, hey, small talk before you guys roll.

768
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
And then, um, so it's small talking.

769
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
He starts talking about current USC stuff.

770
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
We didn't even roll.

771
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
I just want to listen to him talk about USC.

772
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And so he did roll.

773
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
But same thing, same exact thing.

774
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And then, and even when I went up to film with him for the

775
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Metamorphor stuff for Eddie Bravista, same thing.

776
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
He liked for God and brought me again.

777
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
That was like years ago.

778
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
And he was like, oh, yeah, that must have been a long time ago.

779
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Same exact thing.

780
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I was like, yeah, I actually respect the fact that this go, oh, yeah,

781
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
yeah, I remember.

782
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Yeah, yeah, fully.

783
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Yeah, he's, he doesn't play that game.

784
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah, and I actually met 80 million people last year.

785
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And I don't really remember you, but it's good to hang out with you right now again.

786
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Yeah, exactly exactly exactly.

787
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And this, I mean, of course, yeah, Joe Rogan is like this.

788
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
And if people are like this in general, that is just like I said,

789
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
that's kind of like a, not a late missed test, but kind of like,

790
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
it's this indicator, you know, he didn't remember me.

791
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
So really, since he didn't remember me,

792
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
for all intents purposes, I was just another person.

793
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And same exact treatment, just cool, just normal.

794
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Oh, yeah.

795
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
It wasn't like, I mean, you're you, and there's this separation kind of thing.

796
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
It would none of that.

797
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Yeah, no.

798
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
It's good way to be.

799
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Yeah.

800
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I don't know how we ended up talking about that one.

801
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
You dropped Joe Rogan's name and we said, it's not going to be that.

802
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
So, you know.

803
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Good point, name job.

804
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
name job.

805
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
All right.

806
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Next, your mount should be of normal strength and spirit.

807
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Horses with a strong urge to win or fearful and skiddish

808
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
should be rejected out of hand.

809
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
So I thought this was interesting.

810
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Because we're talking about finding someone that's balanced, right?

811
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Not someone that's, he's a normal, normal strength and spirit.

812
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Don't want someone that's, brah, grow.

813
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
But you don't want someone that's weak.

814
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
You want someone that's in the middle.

815
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And the, the amplification on it says horses without nerve or weak while a horse with a lot of spirit

816
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
cannot be written by normal people.

817
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Hmm.

818
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000
In other words, a slightly strong somewhat plucky horse is best, plucky, by the way.

819
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Second time we've heard that word today.

820
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Hmm.

821
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
This is a sign to learn the word.

822
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Do you know what it means?

823
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
I didn't know it.

824
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
No, no.

825
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Plucky means brave.

826
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Okay, doesn't need.

827
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
How to look that one up.

828
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Similar here as long as a horse is strong is acceptable.

829
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
It is acceptable for it to have a certain inclination.

830
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
However, never ride a horse with a tendency to retreat.

831
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
So if you got a strong horse, it's, it's basically to me.

832
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
This is as long as the thing is not going to turn tail.

833
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
If it's a little bit feisty, if it's a little bit less a little bit of that,

834
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
you can have a little bit different person.

835
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
And what I took away from this is as a leader once again,

836
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
you're going to get people with some things going on.

837
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Some little personality traits, some little, like when you're putting together a seal

838
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
puttune, you're going to have some guys that are, got some 80 or same creases, right?

839
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Yeah.

840
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
You got 16 guys in a seal puttune.

841
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
You got 36 guys in a task unit that they're not all the same by any stretch.

842
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
And some of them are going to be even further outside the box of, you know,

843
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
they're going to have some kind of, the 80 or same creases.

844
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
You might even call it an issue.

845
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
I think that's kind of an overused word, but it might have some kind of issue, right?

846
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Sure.

847
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Okay.

848
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
What this is saying is, as long as they're not going to retreat and run,

849
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
we're all right.

850
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
But if they're going to retreat and run, if that's their, are you a sink or sink?

851
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Yeah.

852
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Get rid of them.

853
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
What do you call it?

854
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Deal breaker.

855
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Deal breaker.

856
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Deal breaker big time.

857
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
All right.

858
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Next, while small horses may be easier to handle as well as dismount from those

859
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
who prefer such animals are a bit demwitted.

860
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So what I like about this is, if you're in a leadership position,

861
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
you might want to surround yourself with people that are just,

862
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
that are just dudes you say in there.

863
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
You're going to say it.

864
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Yeah.

865
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
I want my horses all just to fall in line and they're easy to get on and off.

866
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
And if I yell at them, they don't bark back.

867
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Yeah.

868
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
You don't want those people.

869
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
You want people that are a little bit harder to handle.

870
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Just a little bit harder to handle.

871
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Maybe they're going to stand up to you. Like I always say, you don't want to be surrounded by yes men.

872
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
You want to be surrounded by people that will question you, it's a, I don't like this plan.

873
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
So that's kind of horses you want.

874
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Not, not little tiny weak horses.

875
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
No.

876
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
All right.

877
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Next.

878
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
You should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably

879
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
blunder even if that sword cuts well.

880
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
So basically, this is like you got to watch a new guy's a little bit.

881
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Wait.

882
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Wait.

883
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Say that again.

884
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000
It's, it's, it's, you should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably

885
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
blunder even if that sword cuts well.

886
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Okay.

887
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
That's it.

888
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
So you got to watch a new guy's in.

889
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Here's the amplification on this one.

890
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
A sword that is not at least a hundred years old is one that you cannot rely on.

891
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Good. Okay.

892
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Yeah.

893
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
It's like young people full of vigor and energy.

894
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
The vitality of a young sword is not entirely stable.

895
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
You cannot rely on it.

896
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Hey, you got to watch.

897
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Yeah.

898
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
You got to watch.

899
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Unproven, unproven.

900
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Got to watch him.

901
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
That makes sense to me.

902
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And I'm not saying they won't be bad asses.

903
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Yeah.

904
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Because it might be.

905
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Right.

906
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
They might be.

907
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
I had new guys that were built complete bad asses.

908
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
But you don't know that.

909
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
I also had new guys where you'd think they're going to be good.

910
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
It's weird man.

911
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
I've been talking about buds a little bit lately.

912
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Sure.

913
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Some of my friends.

914
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
You, you have no idea who's going to make it through.

915
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Yeah.

916
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
You don't know because it's mental right?

917
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
You're, it's mental and physical.

918
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
You can't see.

919
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.000
You can't see.

920
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
You can't see.

921
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
You can't see.

922
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
You can't see.

923
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
You can't see.

924
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
You can't see.

925
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
You can't see.

926
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
You can't see.

927
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
You can't see.

928
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Is there like, I don't know.

929
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
But you know, like, let's say there's a run.

930
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
And you got to, you know, do they, is there any circumstances that are this or similar to this?

931
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Where you got to make this run in, you know, ten minutes, whatever.

932
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
And if you don't make the ten minutes, you're out.

933
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Yeah.

934
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
But there's stuff like that.

935
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
For sure.

936
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Absolutely.

937
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
There's actually the standard times where runs have been in place since I went through

938
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
and they're the same for the food.

939
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
What they call a four mile time run.

940
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Yeah.

941
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And in first phase, the time maximum time you can take is 32 minutes.

942
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
32 minutes.

943
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
What are you running?

944
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
That's, that's, that's your, your surprise because that's slow, right?

945
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Four mile.

946
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
That's a time run.

947
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
That's eight minute mile.

948
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000
That's pretty fast.

949
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
What?

950
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
It's pretty fast.

951
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
No.

952
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
It's pretty fast.

953
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Then in second phase, it goes down to 30 minutes.

954
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Bro, you used to run a what?

955
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Oh, yeah.

956
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
I could do it.

957
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
But it's not like that.

958
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Yeah.

959
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Let me tell you.

960
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Let me tell you.

961
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
That's not fast.

962
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
In second phase, it goes to 30 minutes.

963
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
In fourth phase, it goes to 28 minutes.

964
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
That's a seven minute mile.

965
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
That is not fast.

966
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Yeah.

967
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
I thought you're going to say like 10 minute mile.

968
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
This is what, this is what trips people up or jams people up as you like to say.

969
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
What jams people up is when you do the run, you're not fresh.

970
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
That's the thing.

971
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
You're not fresh.

972
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
You're not fresh.

973
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
You're not fresh.

974
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
You're wearing boots, boots, your pants.

975
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
You're on the soft sand.

976
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
On the sand.

977
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Yeah.

978
00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Yeah.

979
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
And the sand like part of it will be hard pack.

980
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Yeah.

981
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
But then like part of it's going to be soft.

982
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Yeah.

983
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
And this has changed a little bit from what I've been told.

984
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
When I went through the instructors, maybe that run was 4.2 miles.

985
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Yeah.

986
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
4.5 miles.

987
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Maybe it was 3.8 miles.

988
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
They kind of estimated.

989
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
So if you didn't make it the time.

990
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000
So when I went through, if you didn't make the time for that at for run,

991
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
they had your name if you failed to get and you were done.

992
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Okay.

993
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
So it's like one strike.

994
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Yes.

995
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Okay.

996
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Now the interesting thing is if you failed to run and then you failed to swim,

997
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
you could still,

998
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
will you still be there?

999
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
But if you failed to run,

1000
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000
or again, you can.

1001
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Yeah.

1002
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
If you failed to run and to swim and you failed on obstacle course,

1003
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
you'd still be there.

1004
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Okay.

1005
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
I failed one more time.

1006
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
They call it being on the bubble.

1007
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Yeah.

1008
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Actually, I think that actually came from Officer Canada School.

1009
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
I don't think we said the bubble.

1010
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
There's new things that that that developed.

1011
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
That develop in Buds.

1012
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Yeah.

1013
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Take that come.

1014
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Yeah.

1015
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
I've heard on the bubble plenty times.

1016
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
You're on the bubble.

1017
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
They should have tried.

1018
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
That just means in general.

1019
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
In life.

1020
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Yeah.

1021
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Like for your college job.

1022
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Yeah.

1023
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.000
You're in a bubble.

1024
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
You can cut.

1025
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Yeah.

1026
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
So.

1027
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Thanks.

1028
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Okay.

1029
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
So that's what you mean by it's physicals.

1030
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Yeah.

1031
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
It's physical.

1032
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000
If you don't.

1033
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Yeah.

1034
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You can fail physically.

1035
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
I've been telling people this lately.

1036
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
I had to run as fast as I could possibly run the past the runs.

1037
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
For that formula,

1038
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
that would be me too.

1039
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And the one time one time I paste myself.

1040
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
It was like, you know what?

1041
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
I'm just going to paste myself.

1042
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I'm sure I'll be fine.

1043
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
I paste myself.

1044
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Yeah.

1045
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I failed.

1046
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Like.

1047
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
So then from then on.

1048
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
And I had a buddy that was a cross country runner.

1049
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah.

1050
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And I school or college or something.

1051
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Mm-hmm.

1052
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And he's a hate run with me.

1053
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000
And I'm like, yeah.

1054
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
And I didn't.

1055
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Like I'd brand his heart as a.

1056
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
And that's how I had to run every run.

1057
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000
I had to run this hard as I could.

1058
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Yeah.

1059
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
And there's guys that ran cross country.

1060
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Those runs are joke for those guys.

1061
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
I mean, yeah.

1062
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Echo.

1063
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
I mean, there's a lot of people that can run five minute miles.

1064
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Yeah.

1065
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
That are doing those runs.

1066
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
And, you know, a formal run in like 20 to 22 minutes.

1067
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Yeah.

1068
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
And that's not true.

1069
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
I'm surprised that you thought that was fast.

1070
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
I think I just caught you off guard.

1071
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
You know, it's slow dude.

1072
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
It might be slow.

1073
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Do you mean the way me my fast and depends on when you meet my slow.

1074
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
When I used to like run,

1075
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
I would run on the treadmill and I would run a seven minute.

1076
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
And I'm talking to me like the treadmill.

1077
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
But those are, no.

1078
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
That's part of my life.

1079
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
No, that's part of my point.

1080
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
You run on the treadmill.

1081
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
I'd run like a seven minute mile pace.

1082
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
And I'd be like dang.

1083
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
And, but I don't only do like one mile.

1084
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Gonna be like good.

1085
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
That's like, I've, I've only run on a treadmill like three times.

1086
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
It's easier.

1087
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.000
It's easier.

1088
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Yeah.

1089
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
You're like, if I was on board ships,

1090
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
I would run around the flight deck.

1091
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Yeah.

1092
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
So that's what I mean.

1093
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
I'm talking to you.

1094
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
These guys running seven, eight minute mile.

1095
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Usually when I'd run like four miles or five miles on the treadmill,

1096
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
it'd be like ten, like just under like nine minutes.

1097
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Something like that.

1098
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I don't even know how to translate to your treadmill.

1099
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
I honestly don't.

1100
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I don't know how that translates.

1101
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Yeah.

1102
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
So I would say it's like, but a nine minute mile is pathetic.

1103
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Right.

1104
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
That's, and that's what the pace older run my four miles.

1105
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
And I wouldn't be dead, but I'd be that beat.

1106
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Yes.

1107
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
There's a harder.

1108
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
If I, if you want me to run an eight minute, seven minute, eight minute mile with boots

1109
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
in the sand even some of the time you're crazy.

1110
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
I would be.

1111
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
So you're a little bit of a distance runner is what I'm hearing.

1112
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Apparently, yeah.

1113
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
I would be going like you as fast as I possibly can to make it.

1114
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Check.

1115
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Dang.

1116
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Back to the book.

1117
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Well, you should select a sword with a handle that is long and thin.

1118
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
You should reject any sword with one that is excessively long.

1119
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
I like that a lot of these rules are balanced.

1120
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
They're about balance.

1121
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
That's what they're about.

1122
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Hey, you want it long and thin, but don't.

1123
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Yeah.

1124
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
You want to horse that's strong, but not overly strong.

1125
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Yeah.

1126
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
This is a lot about balance.

1127
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
And here's the amplification.

1128
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
You are less likely to drop a sword with a thin handle.

1129
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
However, in cold weather, you are liable to drop a sword with a thick handle.

1130
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000
For the most part, when on horseback, you should pass a string through the hand guard of your sword and tie it to your arm.

1131
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Once you drop it, you will to pick it up again.

1132
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Have landed.

1133
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Have a landed on your weapon.

1134
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Have a leash.

1135
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Have a board?

1136
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
No.

1137
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
That's different.

1138
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
No, no, no, no, no.

1139
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
I think that's the same thing.

1140
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
No, no, no.

1141
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000
These are for dogs.

1142
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Don't.

1143
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I had my whole career.

1144
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Had a landed on my pistol.

1145
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Only needed it one time.

1146
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Dang.

1147
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
I don't think I even heard of it.

1148
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Meaning, me and I only dropped my pistol one time.

1149
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Yeah.

1150
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Yeah.

1151
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Next.

1152
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Again, balance.

1153
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
It is good for the tip of your spear to be long.

1154
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000
However, if it is too long, you may find yourself in trouble.

1155
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Amplification, the blade on the end of your spear should be long, but not excessively so.

1156
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
If it is too heavy, then you'll lose it.

1157
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Balance.

1158
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Gotta keep things balanced.

1159
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Next, even if you are able to fly up into the sky without feathers, you have no chance of victory with a spear.

1160
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You cannot wield with your own two hands.

1161
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I like that one.

1162
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Is that kind of like girls overpacking for a trip and making you carry their stuff?

1163
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I don't think it has anything to do with that.

1164
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Kind of.

1165
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
When you really think about it, think about it.

1166
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Oh, because she can't carry her stuff.

1167
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yes, she has all her stuff that she needs, and she's going to do well on the vacation as far as comfort goes whatever.

1168
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But she can't even carry it.

1169
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
If you would have made it not about vacation, but about patrolling on the woods, right?

1170
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It's great that you brought a whisper light and extra food and all this other stuff.

1171
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
But you can't carry it.

1172
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yeah, yeah.

1173
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Yeah.

1174
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Remember Lafay was talking about that?

1175
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah.

1176
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
First patrol, the body.

1177
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
You had 27 and grand grandads with them.

1178
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
You used ready for World War III though.

1179
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You know.

1180
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yeah, because it was the double doozy was getting acclimated to being in the 120 degree heat and getting acclimated to running around the Marine Corps is out.

1181
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:24.000
They've been out there for months sprinting from corner to corner to cover cover and they've already minimized their gear somewhat.

1182
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And Lafay shows up.

1183
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
He's not only easy, a little heavy or maybe even a lot heavy.

1184
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
But also he's getting acclimated.

1185
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So it's a double.

1186
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's a one-two punch.

1187
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yep.

1188
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
All right.

1189
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
This is a good one.

1190
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
While the shaft of your spear should be long ignored the ground at your peril.

1191
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
When I first read that, I was like, myself, okay, what does that mean?

1192
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Let me ignore the ground.

1193
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Here's the amplification.

1194
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The length of short to see your spear as well as the weight lighter heavier should differ based on three factors.

1195
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
You, your enemy and the battleground.

1196
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So even if your spear is sufficient, not having an understanding of the terrain will result in defeat.

1197
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
terrain.

1198
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That's what that means by ground.

1199
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yeah.

1200
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Ignore the ground at your peril.

1201
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And this is something that's very difficult.

1202
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
It's something that we don't talk about even even I've talked about it before on this podcast.

1203
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Mm-hmm.

1204
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Knowing terrain.

1205
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
That's what combat is.

1206
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Combat is knowing and understanding the terrain.

1207
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's knowing and understanding the ground.

1208
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It's understanding land features and buildings and what angles producing and where your patrol should go and where a good ambush site would be.

1209
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That is all based on knowing the ground.

1210
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
The terrain is what we call, we don't call the ground.

1211
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
We call it the terrain.

1212
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah.

1213
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Knowing terrain features.

1214
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Micro features.

1215
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Micro terrain.

1216
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
What's this little draw?

1217
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Dead space.

1218
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
All these little things are so important.

1219
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So that rule absolutely applies to this day.

1220
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Next.

1221
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Samurai do not gorge themselves at bankwits.

1222
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Eating twice a day is more than enough.

1223
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
An amplification.

1224
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Samurai must train themselves to be able to withstand hunger and to always be on their guard.

1225
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So today's past it was said that two meals a day is plenty.

1226
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It appears there were some people eating three times a day in this era.

1227
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Dropping the hammer.

1228
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Do you eat three meals a day?

1229
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Three.

1230
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah.

1231
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That's how.

1232
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Sometimes two.

1233
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
What I'm feeling, you know, more your spirit.

1234
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Yeah.

1235
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I've actually heard that.

1236
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I think hoiler was the one who told me that two meals a day.

1237
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
No, it wasn't as much as it was the amount of meals a day.

1238
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It was like the type of meals.

1239
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You know, they would eat that meat.

1240
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They have a certain mix of kind of formula.

1241
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But they see diet.

1242
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah.

1243
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And if you notice it, it's really light.

1244
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
But nanos you know.

1245
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You come first.

1246
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah.

1247
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah.

1248
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It's weird stuff that you're going to miss.

1249
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah.

1250
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But we made this smoothie for one time.

1251
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It was like, there was like, I want to say cream cheese in there with water

1252
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Mellon and but it was like interesting little mix.

1253
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
But it was good though.

1254
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000
But it was like, it's like a lot of stuff is like, because you, um, you know, when you get a lot of people coming in trying to challenge you at the academy.

1255
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It's like, oh, it's going, you know, when people, you've got to be ready.

1256
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You've got to be ready.

1257
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah.

1258
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So you can't be like, oh, I just ate up, you know, I don't know.

1259
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I don't like drinking.

1260
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
People ask me that all the time.

1261
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Do you, do you, do you, what are you eating the morning before you work out?

1262
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I don't know anything.

1263
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Nothing.

1264
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Yes.

1265
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And I don't like to eat before I train.

1266
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Oh, great.

1267
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And some people say, oh, it's an hour and a half.

1268
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But now I'm going to have to for a train. I don't even like to eat two, three hours before I try to.

1269
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I mean, that's why it's much, but chicken today.

1270
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You got the laid.

1271
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And I was like, hey, if I don't eat now, you might get angry.

1272
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
No, then by the time I'm training tonight,

1273
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
No, yeah, I didn't.

1274
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Then I would have to eat when we were done.

1275
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And then all the sudden it's, yeah, 45 minutes to an hour and I'm on the mat.

1276
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And I don't like that feeling.

1277
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Oh, it's starting to my gut.

1278
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Yeah, I rather not eat.

1279
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
We'll consider this where in a real general way.

1280
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I've explained it in it.

1281
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
If you, you know, when you eat something, your stomach got to work.

1282
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
You're something muscle.

1283
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, it's smooth muscles.

1284
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah.

1285
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
That's a little still.

1286
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Scallot muscles.

1287
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
By the way, smooth muscles.

1288
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
They got to get to work.

1289
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I mean, you know, and enzymes go in there.

1290
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
All this stuff.

1291
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So that's taken away from your.

1292
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Yeah, the blood flow like all this.

1293
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Basically, the resources of your body start going to your stomach.

1294
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Now, and now you want to demand some resources for the rest of your body.

1295
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Well, when you go to train, the stomach's like, hey, what about us?

1296
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Resources bail from the stomach a little bit.

1297
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Stomph feels upset.

1298
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You might throw up.

1299
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Mm-hmm.

1300
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
We're feel like it.

1301
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And you almost puked the other day.

1302
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah, that's bad.

1303
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
All right.

1304
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Same subject.

1305
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
That's why I'm going to go right to it.

1306
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
If a samurai is preparing to step onto the field of battle, does why do avoid?

1307
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Is wise to avoid eating anything other than hot water poured over rice?

1308
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So that's one way to do it.

1309
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Keep the amplification.

1310
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
If you eat a lot at a banquet before a great battle, the food will not have settled

1311
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
by the time the fighting starts echo Charles called it.

1312
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah.

1313
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
If you then were to have your head chopped off, all that food would come out and it would

1314
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
make a great big mess.

1315
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Food will not pass down the throne of a coward.

1316
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It appears to you is not common.

1317
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Okay.

1318
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Next one.

1319
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Something a samurai should never be without is the thing you use to sharpen your blade.

1320
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
A wet stone.

1321
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Makes sense, right?

1322
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah.

1323
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That's why you bring your rings when you go on your own.

1324
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Your neck going on travel.

1325
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Yeah.

1326
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
If I go for multiple days.

1327
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
If I go, if I'm only going to be gone for like two or three days, I will just use whatever

1328
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
random pull up bar I can find or make or yeah.

1329
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
But if I'm going for five days, six days, bring the rings.

1330
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Yeah.

1331
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That rings make a big difference if you have rings.

1332
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah.

1333
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So many workouts you can do with just rings.

1334
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah.

1335
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
When you think about it and I know this from experience, it's in my experience.

1336
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's harder to find something to do pull ups on than what you'd expect.

1337
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Do you think, oh yeah, I can just do it like right here.

1338
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Wherever.

1339
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
But it can be harder.

1340
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah.

1341
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You can do push ups anywhere.

1342
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
You can do inkline push ups.

1343
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You go against the on needle.

1344
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I'll do inkline push ups.

1345
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And you can also use.

1346
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It's crazy squats and crystals and jump squats.

1347
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yeah.

1348
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Burpees.

1349
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah.

1350
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Pollups.

1351
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
That's why rings are key.

1352
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And once you have rings, then you can also do ring dips.

1353
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You can do like assisted squats if you need them.

1354
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I don't want to do that, but.

1355
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Oh, no.

1356
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You don't need them.

1357
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
No, no.

1358
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Well, I think these blocks.

1359
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You're the man.

1360
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Bro, I'm not over here bragging about being able to do empty body weight squats.

1361
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But.

1362
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
But you can do everything once you have pararigs.

1363
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And you can usually find a place to do pull ups somewhere.

1364
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Parking rush.

1365
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
They have little overhanging ledges.

1366
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
They have eye beams.

1367
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You can hang on to.

1368
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
They have eye dysaches.

1369
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I know someone's going to rip it and break it and spray water.

1370
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Every over the half sprinkler system.

1371
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Yeah.

1372
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And that's actually plumbing.

1373
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Plumming is part of my point.

1374
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Actually, the cast iron where they where the sewage goes out of a building.

1375
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It's usually a big pipe.

1376
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And it's hard to do purpose.

1377
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
But it's good.

1378
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Yeah.

1379
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I don't think that that's.

1380
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I think that's a risk right there.

1381
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And it's probably against some sort of a blue hole at the hotel.

1382
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah.

1383
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You're so kind of careful.

1384
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Don't tell him.

1385
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I told you.

1386
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yeah.

1387
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Bring the blame me.

1388
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Break through.

1389
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And then we'll work.

1390
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I'm going to get your your faults.

1391
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Next.

1392
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000
It is unseen me for a samurai to be enamored with the flavor of food that is set down before them.

1393
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It's best that your meal be a soup made of boiled water poured over rice.

1394
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's how they roll.

1395
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Yeah.

1396
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They're just like, you know what I'm going to eat?

1397
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yeah.

1398
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
With hot water poured over it.

1399
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Yeah.

1400
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Otherwise, the distraction.

1401
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Do you think that that.

1402
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
That sort of a set of system keeps keeps you tougher.

1403
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Kind of.

1404
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Yeah.

1405
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
In a way.

1406
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It provides less distraction from your goal.

1407
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Because I can in fitness and you know, like working out.

1408
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Body building.

1409
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
A lot of time.

1410
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Like that's a factor big time.

1411
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Because you got to eat a certain amount to maintain or gain weight and all this stuff.

1412
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And, you know, maintain certain, you know, back rows.

1413
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You know, fat levels all this stuff.

1414
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
So you can't just be going to KFC and wherever you think is super delicious.

1415
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And just eating and being like, hey, this, you got to have like certain amount of like lean stuff.

1416
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And you can't add a bunch of sauces because there's extra calories in there.

1417
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You know, all this stuff.

1418
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So yeah, if you, if you can endure that kind of kind of like food that doesn't necessarily taste that good.

1419
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yeah, you can get to your goal way better.

1420
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
What about Charlie Plum, me eating two balls of rice a day for six years?

1421
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Yeah.

1422
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I'm sure that, you know, that kind of helped them help the later.

1423
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
What?

1424
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It's like accepting of conditions.

1425
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Okay.

1426
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Well, that, yeah.

1427
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
You know, like you, it's like if you're, if you're used to sleeping on the floor with like no AC and then you get whatever.

1428
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Yeah, you know, you can go sleep on someone's couch.

1429
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You can go get rest pretty much anywhere.

1430
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And that's a good luxury.

1431
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
If you, especially when you compare it to a situation where you don't, you don't have that kind of tolerance, you know.

1432
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
You know, the kind of where you, like you need a certain like softness and temperature and

1433
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
noise level to sleep, there's people fall asleep.

1434
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Yeah.

1435
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And then some people, they'll just fall right.

1436
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Yeah.

1437
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
While you're talking to them if they want to kind of think.

1438
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Yeah.

1439
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I can see, I can see, I can see, really, he's on airplanes.

1440
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Yeah.

1441
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Me too.

1442
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I get a little crouched up and a little ball.

1443
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And then he's going to sleep.

1444
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
You know what, here's what he actually says.

1445
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Here's the amplifying information.

1446
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
The profession of the samurai involves being an extreme environment.

1447
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Therefore, gourmet food is of no benefit to them.

1448
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
There you go.

1449
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Do you think that people that just eat really, really high in food all the time, when they go back to eating normal food?

1450
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Is it, like, are they suffering?

1451
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah, probably a little bit.

1452
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah.

1453
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
In one way.

1454
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You depends how they regard it, you know?

1455
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Because you know, it's funny when I was a kid, we, like, I eat a lot of steak now.

1456
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Sure.

1457
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
When I was a kid, we didn't even need steak.

1458
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Steak costs a lot of money. It does. And when I was a kid, we hamburgers.

1459
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Sure.

1460
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yeah.

1461
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
A lot of hamburgers.

1462
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Yeah, that is what.

1463
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Yeah.

1464
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I didn't even like steak when I got in the Navy, I didn't like steak.

1465
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Huh.

1466
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Then like it, I had to, I didn't, I just wasn't used to it.

1467
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Yeah.

1468
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It took me a couple years before I started liking steak.

1469
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Yeah.

1470
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Usually you hit that one steak that's, like, prepared perfectly.

1471
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And then in your mind, you're like, dang, I love steak now.

1472
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And then even if you get another steak that wasn't prepared that perfectly,

1473
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I don't even know if you're, I don't know if you're assuming it happened to me.

1474
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Yeah.

1475
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Don't even know if you're just like a, I remember eating burgers at Wendy's though.

1476
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah.

1477
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah.

1478
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah.

1479
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah.

1480
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah.

1481
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
All right.

1482
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Next.

1483
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
When entering a confrontation, Samurai should need to look back on the path traveled.

1484
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Nor what is off to left to right.

1485
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So to me that says,

1486
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I would prioritize next to you, right?

1487
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
No, we're looking around.

1488
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You see what you see, what you got to, you see what you got to do.

1489
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
You got to confrontation front of you.

1490
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Here's the implication from the onset.

1491
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You should place your, place your full concentration on the battle and not allow your focus to laps during the course of the battle.

1492
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
The most important aspects of the battle, the most important aspects of battle are the use of people and the use of natural geography.

1493
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Right?

1494
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You're a leader. You got to use your people correctly.

1495
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And as I just talked about terrain using the natural geography, those are the two most important things.

1496
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Now can you get target fixation?

1497
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Yes, you can.

1498
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So you can get so focused that if you don't pay attention, what's going on left and right, you might get flicked.

1499
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Yeah.

1500
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So you got to watch out for that one.

1501
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Next.

1502
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.96
Samurai should mind neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter as they race through fields and over

1503
01:13:12.96 --> 01:13:14.96
mountains, exhausting their bodies.

1504
01:13:14.96 --> 01:13:15.96
Boom.

1505
01:13:15.96 --> 01:13:17.96
You got to train a heat and cold.

1506
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:18.96
Yeah.

1507
01:13:18.96 --> 01:13:20.96
That's welcome to the military.

1508
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:23.96
You freeze and you sweat.

1509
01:13:23.96 --> 01:13:25.96
That's the way it works.

1510
01:13:25.96 --> 01:13:26.96
Yeah.

1511
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:33.96
Funny, Tonya Fraddy and you kind of turned me on to just mentally.

1512
01:13:33.96 --> 01:13:38.96
It's more like putting your mind at a certain, in a certain way where, sure it'll be cold,

1513
01:13:38.96 --> 01:13:41.96
but it's not about how cold or not cold it is.

1514
01:13:41.96 --> 01:13:42.96
Sure it'll be hot.

1515
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:46.96
It's not about how hot or not hot it is and you can't complain about that stuff.

1516
01:13:46.96 --> 01:13:51.96
And if you complain, that's like, that's the part that's going to jam you up.

1517
01:13:51.96 --> 01:13:52.96
Just how you regard it.

1518
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:53.96
Yeah.

1519
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:55.96
You could not complain in the deems.

1520
01:13:55.96 --> 01:13:56.96
Here's what's funny.

1521
01:13:56.96 --> 01:13:57.96
Here's what's funny.

1522
01:13:57.96 --> 01:14:00.96
I just, you can experience this really easily.

1523
01:14:00.96 --> 01:14:08.96
Let's say you and me are out at the beach and it's warm, but out here in California, once a

1524
01:14:08.96 --> 01:14:11.96
sun goes down, it cool off really quickly.

1525
01:14:11.96 --> 01:14:15.96
You don't have a sweatshirt, whether you need to do I.

1526
01:14:15.96 --> 01:14:19.96
You've got a sweatshirt in your bag.

1527
01:14:19.96 --> 01:14:23.96
Maybe I have one too because actually this is a contradiction because if I don't bring one,

1528
01:14:23.96 --> 01:14:24.96
that means I'm not well prepared.

1529
01:14:24.96 --> 01:14:25.96
Yeah.

1530
01:14:25.96 --> 01:14:26.96
So I got one in my bag.

1531
01:14:26.96 --> 01:14:27.96
Right.

1532
01:14:27.96 --> 01:14:28.96
I'm not going to put it on.

1533
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:29.96
Take it out.

1534
01:14:29.96 --> 01:14:30.96
You put it on your way.

1535
01:14:30.96 --> 01:14:31.96
No, I'm not even going to do that.

1536
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:32.96
I'm not even going to do that.

1537
01:14:32.96 --> 01:14:33.96
Just going to leave it.

1538
01:14:33.96 --> 01:14:36.96
You would not want to, you just want to be TF as long as you can.

1539
01:14:36.96 --> 01:14:37.96
Yeah.

1540
01:14:37.96 --> 01:14:41.96
I don't want to, I don't want to, you to see me putting on a sweatshirt, indicating to you that I was

1541
01:14:41.96 --> 01:14:42.96
cold enough.

1542
01:14:42.96 --> 01:14:45.96
I'm going to, I'm going to pamper myself, not happening.

1543
01:14:45.96 --> 01:14:47.96
What if I wasn't there?

1544
01:14:47.96 --> 01:14:49.96
Proud about put the sweatshirt on all day long.

1545
01:14:49.96 --> 01:14:51.96
Yeah, this is straight up.

1546
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:53.96
No, there's no denying that.

1547
01:14:53.96 --> 01:14:59.96
Yeah, that's so funny because before I thought like that, I would have thought that's so dumb.

1548
01:14:59.96 --> 01:15:02.96
Like, put in your sweat, you're ruining your experience or whatever.

1549
01:15:02.96 --> 01:15:04.96
You got to be each with your whatever friends.

1550
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:07.96
You're going to do a search for this actually happened yesterday.

1551
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:08.96
Proud.

1552
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:10.96
Are these out of surf contest?

1553
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:11.96
Yeah.

1554
01:15:11.96 --> 01:15:14.96
And like the clouds came in and it got cool.

1555
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:14.96
Yeah.

1556
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:16.96
And my buddy, he was off.

1557
01:15:16.96 --> 01:15:18.96
He was a hammer to go put a sweatshirt on.

1558
01:15:18.96 --> 01:15:20.96
And I was like, oh, really?

1559
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:21.96
I saw it.

1560
01:15:21.96 --> 01:15:22.96
I see.

1561
01:15:22.96 --> 01:15:24.96
Then we both went to gynax sweatshirts.

1562
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:25.96
But he let him do it.

1563
01:15:25.96 --> 01:15:27.96
Yeah, he wasn't in teams too.

1564
01:15:27.96 --> 01:15:28.96
Yeah, yeah.

1565
01:15:28.96 --> 01:15:31.96
So I wasn't just trying to, because there's always that little thing going on in the team.

1566
01:15:31.96 --> 01:15:34.96
Yeah, but I kind of feel like, and it goes on in general too.

1567
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:37.96
Just, you know, yeah, fully like like you're going to rock in your shoe.

1568
01:15:37.96 --> 01:15:40.96
Just don't just don't get it out.

1569
01:15:40.96 --> 01:15:41.96
Just don't get it out.

1570
01:15:41.96 --> 01:15:42.96
Leave it in there.

1571
01:15:42.96 --> 01:15:43.96
Yeah.

1572
01:15:43.96 --> 01:15:46.96
But before that episode with Tony, like, I would be the guy, be like, no, I'm cold.

1573
01:15:46.96 --> 01:15:47.96
You know, I can't relate.

1574
01:15:47.96 --> 01:15:50.96
But after that for some reason, I think you just morphed in my mind too.

1575
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:53.96
Like, you just got beat TF and you kind of take pride.

1576
01:15:53.96 --> 01:15:54.96
Yeah.

1577
01:15:54.96 --> 01:15:56.96
Yeah.

1578
01:15:56.96 --> 01:15:57.96
Yeah.

1579
01:15:57.96 --> 01:15:58.96
Next.

1580
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:06.96
As Samurai, you should take it upon yourself to spend time playing in a water.

1581
01:16:06.96 --> 01:16:11.96
Not doing so could well result in disaster.

1582
01:16:11.96 --> 01:16:13.96
That's part one.

1583
01:16:13.96 --> 01:16:15.96
Obviously, I agree with that one.

1584
01:16:15.96 --> 01:16:17.96
You got to be in the water.

1585
01:16:17.96 --> 01:16:24.96
Part two, Samurai should as a matter of course, engage in contest, substraint.

1586
01:16:24.96 --> 01:16:28.96
If you're not, then your muscles will become slack.

1587
01:16:28.96 --> 01:16:30.96
Obviously, I support that one.

1588
01:16:30.96 --> 01:16:33.96
I don't know if this guy would just want to read this book.

1589
01:16:33.96 --> 01:16:34.96
Yeah.

1590
01:16:34.96 --> 01:16:36.96
Is he knew that I was going to be, I mean, how could you not?

1591
01:16:36.96 --> 01:16:39.96
How does that not relate to everything that I talk about all the time?

1592
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:40.96
Yeah.

1593
01:16:40.96 --> 01:16:42.96
Be in the water.

1594
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:44.96
Work out.

1595
01:16:44.96 --> 01:16:46.96
Here's what's funny about this one.

1596
01:16:46.96 --> 01:16:52.96
Oh, he says that the peasants strengthen themselves with their day to day labor.

1597
01:16:52.96 --> 01:16:56.96
They also tested themselves by lifting and carrying large stones in front of the local shrines

1598
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:01.96
and did pushups in order to build their muscles and thereby increase their overall strength.

1599
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:08.96
However, beginning in the Meiji era, such feats of strength became began to be ridiculed

1600
01:17:08.96 --> 01:17:11.96
and the use of rocks to indelde.

1601
01:17:11.96 --> 01:17:17.96
Thus, it is hardly a surprise that the youth of today are weak.

1602
01:17:17.96 --> 01:17:18.96
Yeah.

1603
01:17:18.96 --> 01:17:22.96
And also, it's kind of like that now.

1604
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:26.96
Let's say quote unquote, grown adults.

1605
01:17:26.96 --> 01:17:28.96
Let's see who can lift that rock.

1606
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:30.96
That's cool, though, right?

1607
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:32.96
Why are you saying it weird voice?

1608
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:34.96
No, because I would say generally speaking, that's kind of like,

1609
01:17:34.96 --> 01:17:36.96
oh, you chat, children.

1610
01:17:36.96 --> 01:17:37.96
You know, like, what are you guys doing?

1611
01:17:37.96 --> 01:17:38.96
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1612
01:17:38.96 --> 01:17:39.96
You can make fun of that?

1613
01:17:39.96 --> 01:17:41.96
Yeah, if you don't know, I can feel pizza strength.

1614
01:17:41.96 --> 01:17:42.96
I think competitions.

1615
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:45.96
What do you think the CrossFit games are, though?

1616
01:17:45.96 --> 01:17:46.96
Yeah.

1617
01:17:46.96 --> 01:17:48.96
Just world-strongest manners.

1618
01:17:48.96 --> 01:17:56.96
Yes, I think the UFC is totally agree, but I think if it's not like organized and then like presented, you know, kind of thing.

1619
01:17:56.96 --> 01:18:00.96
Like, if me and you were just cruising at the beach and then I'm like, oh, that's funny.

1620
01:18:00.96 --> 01:18:05.96
We did me and being how like went to Australia.

1621
01:18:05.96 --> 01:18:06.96
Right.

1622
01:18:06.96 --> 01:18:10.96
And we're like, all cruising some downtime, we're filming this, this, you know, this video.

1623
01:18:10.96 --> 01:18:14.96
And Brad just turned into that, well, 100%.

1624
01:18:14.96 --> 01:18:17.96
It was just me and him. So we went from pushups.

1625
01:18:17.96 --> 01:18:23.96
He was like, hey, what about the challenge you did, the challenge you did in Maine?

1626
01:18:23.96 --> 01:18:25.96
Yeah, perfect.

1627
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:26.96
Yeah, perfect.

1628
01:18:26.96 --> 01:18:28.96
Yeah, that's like the lift it got a shoulder to the back.

1629
01:18:28.96 --> 01:18:30.96
Yeah, a gravel, by the way.

1630
01:18:30.96 --> 01:18:33.96
So it's not like a 200 pound bar belt.

1631
01:18:33.96 --> 01:18:33.96
Right.

1632
01:18:33.96 --> 01:18:34.96
Gravel thing.

1633
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:36.96
Yeah, seeing that's a perfect example.

1634
01:18:36.96 --> 01:18:38.96
But that makes you strong.

1635
01:18:38.96 --> 01:18:39.96
I think so too.

1636
01:18:39.96 --> 01:18:40.96
Yeah, I agree with it.

1637
01:18:40.96 --> 01:18:46.96
I'm just, I'm just saying like, if let's say we're all at a like a part of barbecue with

1638
01:18:46.96 --> 01:18:50.96
like just a vast variety, but like that's totally acceptable.

1639
01:18:50.96 --> 01:18:53.96
You know, the 200 pound bag challenge.

1640
01:18:53.96 --> 01:18:59.96
It's all just guys, like, you know, but if we were at a barbecue, you know, let's say my daughter was a birthday party.

1641
01:18:59.96 --> 01:19:00.96
Yeah.

1642
01:19:00.96 --> 01:19:02.96
Yeah, but you know, your kettlebell's out, right?

1643
01:19:02.96 --> 01:19:03.96
Yeah.

1644
01:19:03.96 --> 01:19:09.96
If I challenge you to the kettlebell, like, let's see who can do the night.

1645
01:19:09.96 --> 01:19:13.96
Whatever the 90 pound one or something at my daughter's birthday party.

1646
01:19:13.96 --> 01:19:19.96
I think aside from me, you and me, handful of other guys that are our direct peers.

1647
01:19:19.96 --> 01:19:19.96
Yeah.

1648
01:19:19.96 --> 01:19:20.96
It's like from them.

1649
01:19:20.96 --> 01:19:22.96
I think people would be like, you guys are dull.

1650
01:19:22.96 --> 01:19:23.96
Hmm.

1651
01:19:23.96 --> 01:19:24.96
That's what I think.

1652
01:19:24.96 --> 01:19:25.96
They might be right.

1653
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:26.96
They might be right.

1654
01:19:26.96 --> 01:19:28.96
All right.

1655
01:19:28.96 --> 01:19:29.96
Next.

1656
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:38.96
If you allow your samurai spirit to wither, clearly your body will then follow suit.

1657
01:19:38.96 --> 01:19:43.96
Your skin will begin to stretch as you gain weight.

1658
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:45.96
Part one.

1659
01:19:45.96 --> 01:19:47.96
I think we all disagree with the green.

1660
01:19:47.96 --> 01:19:48.96
That was right.

1661
01:19:48.96 --> 01:19:55.96
Do you think that this goes back to the comfort question?

1662
01:19:55.96 --> 01:19:57.96
Let's take you, Jitu.

1663
01:19:57.96 --> 01:20:03.96
At a certain point where you say, I don't really care if I get caught by this guy or I'm, you know what?

1664
01:20:03.96 --> 01:20:10.96
I'm that guy's training for worlds and hey, if you catch his me, you know what I mean?

1665
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:11.96
Yeah.

1666
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:12.96
Yeah.

1667
01:20:12.96 --> 01:20:13.96
I see what you're asking.

1668
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:19.96
So my point is, at a certain point, you accept it.

1669
01:20:19.96 --> 01:20:21.96
Yeah.

1670
01:20:21.96 --> 01:20:23.96
I think that's okay.

1671
01:20:23.96 --> 01:20:24.96
I do think it's okay.

1672
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:25.96
I don't.

1673
01:20:25.96 --> 01:20:26.96
I know you don't.

1674
01:20:26.96 --> 01:20:28.96
And it's not an absolute, yes.

1675
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:30.96
We're not on the door.

1676
01:20:30.96 --> 01:20:33.96
When the door is, you know, hey, it's okay.

1677
01:20:33.96 --> 01:20:34.96
Yeah.

1678
01:20:34.96 --> 01:20:37.96
I'm, I'm all the excuses, right?

1679
01:20:37.96 --> 01:20:38.96
Yeah.

1680
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:44.96
Hey, you know, these guys are young and they're training for the, the, the, this competition or that competition.

1681
01:20:44.96 --> 01:20:46.96
You've got to get in there with them.

1682
01:20:46.96 --> 01:20:48.96
When I hear that knocking, I slam the door.

1683
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:49.96
Yeah.

1684
01:20:49.96 --> 01:20:50.96
Red flag on.

1685
01:20:50.96 --> 01:20:51.96
Yeah.

1686
01:20:51.96 --> 01:20:52.96
Finally.

1687
01:20:52.96 --> 01:20:53.96
Actually, I opened the door and I choked that person out.

1688
01:20:53.96 --> 01:20:54.96
Bring it.

1689
01:20:54.96 --> 01:20:55.96
Yeah.

1690
01:20:55.96 --> 01:20:56.96
I dig it and I'm not.

1691
01:20:56.96 --> 01:20:59.96
You can see, but I think if that, when you accept that, I feel, you know,

1692
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:01.96
when you accept it, yeah.

1693
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:04.96
And the other thing that happens is your ego gets in the way, right?

1694
01:21:04.96 --> 01:21:05.96
Yeah.

1695
01:21:05.96 --> 01:21:08.96
Because because what happens is you don't want to, you don't want to get tapped out.

1696
01:21:08.96 --> 01:21:09.96
Yeah.

1697
01:21:09.96 --> 01:21:10.96
That's bad.

1698
01:21:10.96 --> 01:21:11.96
Yeah.

1699
01:21:11.96 --> 01:21:12.96
So you don't want to get tapped out so you're not going to try it.

1700
01:21:12.96 --> 01:21:13.96
Yeah.

1701
01:21:13.96 --> 01:21:14.96
And it, right?

1702
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:15.96
Right.

1703
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:15.96
That happens.

1704
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:16.96
Yeah.

1705
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:20.96
And it's all different things that all kind of enter into the equation.

1706
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:23.96
So again, it, it comes back to like, why are you, why are you training?

1707
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:24.96
Like, why are you there?

1708
01:21:24.96 --> 01:21:26.96
Injuditsu or whatever.

1709
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:27.96
Like why are you there?

1710
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:33.96
So yeah, if this thing, what he's talking about, where it's like, okay, if you're like letting yourself go, if you're kind of giving up.

1711
01:21:33.96 --> 01:21:37.96
And then justifying it with in this case, oh, I'm older training for world.

1712
01:21:37.96 --> 01:21:41.96
And that's your, your version of giving up.

1713
01:21:41.96 --> 01:21:42.96
Then yeah, that's bad.

1714
01:21:42.96 --> 01:21:46.96
But if it's like, let's say you're like an older guy or whatever.

1715
01:21:46.96 --> 01:21:49.96
And maybe you kind of lost a step or whatever.

1716
01:21:49.96 --> 01:21:52.96
You know, like, like, people do when they get older sometimes.

1717
01:21:52.96 --> 01:22:00.96
And you're like, hey, you know, this guy is getting nuts. If I rise to that level of intensity, I could get heard or something like that.

1718
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:02.96
And it's like in, in, okay, yeah.

1719
01:22:02.96 --> 01:22:04.96
Okay, you know, you can be smart.

1720
01:22:04.96 --> 01:22:05.96
Yeah.

1721
01:22:05.96 --> 01:22:05.96
Right.

1722
01:22:05.96 --> 01:22:06.96
Yeah.

1723
01:22:06.96 --> 01:22:10.96
For instance, if everyone's doing take downs and you're knees a little bit tweaked, you know what?

1724
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:11.96
Exactly.

1725
01:22:11.96 --> 01:22:12.96
Right.

1726
01:22:12.96 --> 01:22:14.96
That's something I need to check myself on sometimes.

1727
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:15.96
Yeah.

1728
01:22:15.96 --> 01:22:15.96
You do.

1729
01:22:15.96 --> 01:22:17.96
Big talk actually.

1730
01:22:17.96 --> 01:22:18.96
Yeah.

1731
01:22:18.96 --> 01:22:20.96
But makes it.

1732
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:24.96
But that's a big one though. Like when you when you start like what I'm talking about.

1733
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:25.96
Yeah.

1734
01:22:25.96 --> 01:22:28.96
What it is is you when you allow your samurai spirit to wither.

1735
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:29.96
That's what we're talking about.

1736
01:22:29.96 --> 01:22:29.96
Yeah.

1737
01:22:29.96 --> 01:22:31.96
When you start saying, hey, you know what?

1738
01:22:31.96 --> 01:22:35.96
I'd rather still just keep fighting, even though you're getting beat because the young

1739
01:22:35.96 --> 01:22:39.96
buck is coming up and you're going to get in the train more than you and you got to work and

1740
01:22:39.96 --> 01:22:39.96
Yeah.

1741
01:22:39.96 --> 01:22:41.96
Hey, you know what? Come time me out then.

1742
01:22:41.96 --> 01:22:42.96
Yeah.

1743
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:42.96
Yeah.

1744
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:45.96
You still got to like maintain the spirit.

1745
01:22:45.96 --> 01:22:46.96
Yeah.

1746
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:46.96
Yeah.

1747
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:47.96
Yeah.

1748
01:22:47.96 --> 01:22:53.96
A lot of times when people get married or they they stop training or whatever and they they

1749
01:22:53.96 --> 01:22:56.96
Blame it on the marriage or they blame it on their career.

1750
01:22:56.96 --> 01:22:56.96
Yeah.

1751
01:22:56.96 --> 01:22:58.96
Something like that is like, ah, you could.

1752
01:22:58.96 --> 01:22:59.96
I lost.

1753
01:22:59.96 --> 01:22:59.96
Yeah.

1754
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:03.96
You know what I do when people say that people say, I'll say, oh, you know,

1755
01:23:03.96 --> 01:23:04.96
someone talking to someone.

1756
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:06.96
No, you don't manage to train a lot.

1757
01:23:06.96 --> 01:23:09.96
And I'll be like, oh, I mean, oh, what what happened?

1758
01:23:09.96 --> 01:23:12.96
And thus we know I got two kids and you know, I just working a lot.

1759
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:13.96
I was like, oh, yeah.

1760
01:23:13.96 --> 01:23:14.96
I got four kids.

1761
01:23:14.96 --> 01:23:16.96
Yeah.

1762
01:23:16.96 --> 01:23:17.96
I was like, oh, yeah.

1763
01:23:17.96 --> 01:23:18.96
And they're driven in their defense.

1764
01:23:18.96 --> 01:23:19.96
Everybody's different.

1765
01:23:19.96 --> 01:23:20.96
Yeah.

1766
01:23:20.96 --> 01:23:23.96
If they have two kids in the four, they're not you and kids aren't here.

1767
01:23:23.96 --> 01:23:26.96
So, yes, that's my wife was good.

1768
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:27.96
Yeah.

1769
01:23:27.96 --> 01:23:28.96
Yeah.

1770
01:23:28.96 --> 01:23:29.96
Oh, that's a bit embarrassing.

1771
01:23:29.96 --> 01:23:30.96
It does make it hard.

1772
01:23:30.96 --> 01:23:31.96
It totally does.

1773
01:23:31.96 --> 01:23:32.96
And it does make it harder.

1774
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:34.96
With the kids and a career and stuff like that.

1775
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:35.96
It's easy.

1776
01:23:35.96 --> 01:23:36.96
Yeah.

1777
01:23:36.96 --> 01:23:37.96
That's what I was going to say.

1778
01:23:37.96 --> 01:23:38.96
It's like.

1779
01:23:38.96 --> 01:23:39.96
baby sili it.

1780
01:23:39.96 --> 01:23:43.96
It's invalid at the end of the day because you either get your toy or your sunrise.

1781
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:50.44
your summer ice spirit or you didn't and if you didn't then you allowed these things which are true by the way

1782
01:23:50.44 --> 01:23:55.000
by your as far as what you're not you but obviously this person is hypothetical person

1783
01:23:55.80 --> 01:24:01.40
if they're career or family got in the way you allowed that to happen it's not easy totally not easy

1784
01:24:02.12 --> 01:24:09.16
sub to you though at the end of the day I think samurai are never without a sword on their hip

1785
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:16.52
this means of course that an unarmed enemy will arm himself so you got always expect in my mind

1786
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:24.84
always expect that your opponent is gonna be armed business life whatever you're doing always

1787
01:24:24.84 --> 01:24:32.92
you can always expect that your opponent is ready I always expect them to be ready next

1788
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:39.08
as a samurai you should take care as to where your feet step as a matter of course

1789
01:24:40.20 --> 01:24:45.80
you never want to be off balance in case the unexpected occurs well that's pretty self-explanatory

1790
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:47.16
the amplifying

1791
01:24:48.60 --> 01:24:51.88
information says samurai have to keep themselves prepared at all times you respond

1792
01:24:53.56 --> 01:24:58.68
they have to be able to react calmly in a situation without any panic boom again does that apply

1793
01:24:58.68 --> 01:25:06.76
to everything yes it does no doubt about it samurai who are not aware of the things they should

1794
01:25:06.76 --> 01:25:15.80
know are like cats that do not know how to catch mice not aware of things they should know

1795
01:25:17.40 --> 01:25:25.80
yeah samurai should be continuously thinking about military manners matters

1796
01:25:25.80 --> 01:25:34.92
fail to do this at your peril those that serve in the military should be in a continuous state of

1797
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:40.68
thinking of warfare to be negligent in this will result in failure and defeat

1798
01:25:44.52 --> 01:25:48.68
you know I told this I tell us the young military people that I work with

1799
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:55.56
that this is your job this is your profession and you're going to do everything you can to master it

1800
01:25:56.36 --> 01:26:02.20
and that means what is being said right here continuously thinking about military manners matters

1801
01:26:05.88 --> 01:26:08.84
any samurai who spends too much time playing ball

1802
01:26:08.84 --> 01:26:19.32
coat-o-gitar plucking the mouth harp or playing the flute are liable to become a coward

1803
01:26:19.32 --> 01:26:23.64
and here it says those in the military should never become overly infatuated with

1804
01:26:23.64 --> 01:26:29.48
diversionary games okay now at some point I'd like to get better at guitar but apparently

1805
01:26:29.48 --> 01:26:39.32
you know I'm gonna bring things to the world next while a samurai maybe clumsy about some

1806
01:26:39.32 --> 01:26:44.92
things the spear the horse and the bow should not be among them I like that

1807
01:26:47.64 --> 01:26:54.36
this one is key samurai should make a habit of regularly listening to tales of military combat

1808
01:26:54.36 --> 01:27:04.20
and rely on the learning found therein this is a blatant plug for jockel podcast

1809
01:27:05.56 --> 01:27:11.16
and here's the amplifying information by listening to such tales regularly it will keep

1810
01:27:11.16 --> 01:27:20.92
them fresh in your mind when actual combat arises they will be of benefit boom boom and I've

1811
01:27:20.92 --> 01:27:26.52
definitely got that feedback I've gotten all kinds of good feedback about that from guys in the military

1812
01:27:27.08 --> 01:27:31.32
that they can relate because I'm telling you the stories that we tell over and over again

1813
01:27:32.44 --> 01:27:38.36
their stories that happen there real things yeah fire maneuver there's people acting weird there's

1814
01:27:38.36 --> 01:27:43.48
the enemy doing things these things are real and it is definitely helpful the more you I wish I

1815
01:27:43.48 --> 01:27:49.16
would have known more when I was in I would have been infinitely better you haven't

1816
01:27:49.16 --> 01:27:53.40
enough of focus on it though yeah kind of goes for everything to yeah like because it kind of

1817
01:27:53.40 --> 01:28:02.28
keeps your whole like approach to life in that that battle frame you know yeah so everything you

1818
01:28:02.28 --> 01:28:06.20
know like gives you different perspectives and I talk about this all the time if if you learn

1819
01:28:06.20 --> 01:28:12.04
the arm bar right from the mount you learn it one way but you don't realize man there's there's

1820
01:28:12.04 --> 01:28:17.000
infinitely different ways to do it you can get it from the guard you can get it from the bottom

1821
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.60
position you can get it from a cross side you can get all the you can get the arm lock from all these

1822
01:28:20.60 --> 01:28:24.68
different positions yeah and every time you see it from a different angle you get better at all of

1823
01:28:24.68 --> 01:28:28.68
them yeah so every time you see a military situation from a different angle from a leadership

1824
01:28:28.68 --> 01:28:32.84
perspective from the ground true perspective from the cold from the hot from the desert from the

1825
01:28:32.84 --> 01:28:39.48
mountains you learn something it makes you better at it yeah so so looking at things through that

1826
01:28:39.48 --> 01:28:44.04
front you know whatever it may be whether it be military history whatever you're always kind of looking

1827
01:28:44.04 --> 01:28:51.000
at things in that way yeah like this guy we call them uncle Jill he's my friend of the family

1828
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.84
and how why and oh yeah and he's he was a really good artist but he used to climb trees and

1829
01:28:56.84 --> 01:29:01.40
take us just tree climbing I don't really know maybe things actually me talking about it right now

1830
01:29:01.40 --> 01:29:07.56
but it was super good fun this guy he'd always be like well there's there's an instinctive of

1831
01:29:08.36 --> 01:29:12.28
climbing right p i think humans have an instinctive climb things yeah I'm

1832
01:29:12.28 --> 01:29:16.84
excited I don't know it seems like yeah okay and the air it would be weird because he

1833
01:29:16.84 --> 01:29:22.28
pulled out that climbing thing he'd be like a bad I could climb up there you know that it's kind

1834
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:27.56
like dang if you kind of have these like looking at things through frames that are that are useful

1835
01:29:27.56 --> 01:29:31.64
you know like I think like but it's like man you can figure a lot of things out that you

1836
01:29:31.64 --> 01:29:36.04
a lot of people wouldn't figure out you know like I know Viva was like that for sure but like

1837
01:29:36.04 --> 01:29:40.52
that's like a good shot how that you know no one's no care that's just a beach or whatever but

1838
01:29:40.52 --> 01:29:48.68
I was a young and listed guy and I had a friend that would he would kind of like your friend

1839
01:29:48.68 --> 01:29:53.32
like like to climb things this guy would jump off the hook. Uncle Joe would climb things this guy

1840
01:29:53.32 --> 01:29:59.72
would jump off the hook and we were on this obstacle course this random obstacle course and he

1841
01:29:59.72 --> 01:30:04.68
climbed he would also like to climb but then he got to the top of this thing he was probably

1842
01:30:04.68 --> 01:30:12.36
let's call it 18 feet and I'm I slid down the rope and the other guy slid down the rope and

1843
01:30:12.36 --> 01:30:18.12
the chief that we were with slid down the rope and I look up and he goes and he's kind of

1844
01:30:18.12 --> 01:30:25.48
got like a puzzle look on his face. The jumper the jumper's got like a curious look on his face.

1845
01:30:25.48 --> 01:30:32.60
Yeah inquisitive yeah and he says I think I could jump down this 18 feet and I go do it

1846
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:42.60
and the chief goes don't do it and he said I think I could make it and I said do it and the

1847
01:30:42.60 --> 01:30:52.68
chief says don't do it and I go 10 bucks and the chief goes shot up Joko don't do it and I go

1848
01:30:53.80 --> 01:31:00.92
20 bucks and he goes shot up I'm not as he's saying that the jumper jumped and he made it

1849
01:31:00.92 --> 01:31:07.72
just like 18 feet down just landed PLF yeah parachute landing fall. It's like you break the

1850
01:31:07.72 --> 01:31:12.60
flying fall down and roll okay yeah it's almost like a judo fall but with your yeah kind of like

1851
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:20.36
it disperses like the way he does he did it it's good man 18 yeah it's good in a good hard

1852
01:31:20.36 --> 01:31:25.40
good way you could have gotten her no it would have been your fall yeah all that kind of thing

1853
01:31:25.40 --> 01:31:31.72
it would have been yeah I know I know you knew his jumping weakness yeah his addiction to jumping

1854
01:31:31.72 --> 01:31:39.56
and you exploited it next samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they only die once

1855
01:31:39.56 --> 01:31:46.92
forgetting this will result in failure samurai who forget this this is so this this one's a

1856
01:31:46.92 --> 01:31:50.68
little bit tricky for me to understand samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they

1857
01:31:50.68 --> 01:31:57.000
only die once forgetting this will result in failure and the amplification on this one says

1858
01:31:57.80 --> 01:32:04.52
samurai who forget that they can die at any time and in any place could end up in humiliating failure

1859
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:11.000
in other words throwing your body into the river and relying on fate to determine

1860
01:32:11.64 --> 01:32:18.28
if you float to the shallows if you love your life too much you will always end in failure so this is

1861
01:32:18.28 --> 01:32:22.60
what I found interesting about this one there's an dichotomy here the dichotomy to me is

1862
01:32:23.72 --> 01:32:28.76
if if you care too much about being alive then you won't take any risk and you'll be too

1863
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:33.08
scared and you'll that's gonna be bad yeah so that's that we know that that one's bad so we know

1864
01:32:33.08 --> 01:32:37.56
we get that one if you love your life too much you will always end in failure maybe not always but

1865
01:32:37.56 --> 01:32:42.76
it's gonna definitely play a role you'll be too cautious you won't take any risk you'll be scared

1866
01:32:42.76 --> 01:32:50.60
that one's gonna be you'll hesitate yeah so we get that one the keeping your hearts that you'll only

1867
01:32:50.60 --> 01:32:58.36
die once okay so that means to me okay so you can die at any time I'm gonna make it worth it

1868
01:32:58.36 --> 01:33:04.44
in my mind make it dope yeah make it dope okay and then this whole thing about okay we read it

1869
01:33:04.44 --> 01:33:10.44
board forward throwing your body into the river and relying on fate to determine if you float

1870
01:33:10.44 --> 01:33:19.32
to the shallows I don't know to me that could be taken two ways and I think they're both okay

1871
01:33:19.96 --> 01:33:25.16
number one is like hey don't just throw just just jump don't just jump into the river and see

1872
01:33:25.16 --> 01:33:29.88
and let fate decide if you're gonna make it I don't know you prepare and you train and you're ready

1873
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:36.76
the other way it could be taken is you know what you can't control everything you got to go

1874
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:42.20
jump into the river and if you if you're meant to make it you're gonna make it even one of those

1875
01:33:42.20 --> 01:33:45.56
can possibly set your mind to be using what I mean you've heard me talk about here in a

1876
01:33:45.56 --> 01:33:49.80
ten way the warrior kid right yeah way the warrior kid what happens you prepare everything you

1877
01:33:49.80 --> 01:33:54.20
can but they eventually got to jump and see if the water the current takes you to the shallow water again

1878
01:33:54.20 --> 01:33:59.40
that's the way it's got to be yeah so that's the way I took that one yeah I read a lot into that one

1879
01:33:59.40 --> 01:34:03.56
I think the first one just because the other one would would add kind of additional

1880
01:34:03.56 --> 01:34:09.64
like requirement required explanation like your story is you agree with preparing I think yeah

1881
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:13.88
yeah I agree with preparing I think the of the two that you just said the first one I think makes

1882
01:34:13.88 --> 01:34:17.08
more sense to me that that's what he meant so you're you're thinking that he meant

1883
01:34:19.96 --> 01:34:25.32
to prepare the best of your ability yeah exactly like he like it's kind of like you only have one

1884
01:34:25.32 --> 01:34:31.72
life and if you're gonna die make it legit don't be dying trying to cross the river you better die

1885
01:34:31.72 --> 01:34:38.76
doing something be it I mean okay I think there's one more little addition that I believe that

1886
01:34:38.76 --> 01:34:43.32
Eric actually added on here yeah this is his note it says the line about throwing your bond into

1887
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:47.56
the river relying on fate to determine if you float in the shallow is very famous it's not

1888
01:34:47.56 --> 01:34:53.96
that famous because I Google it back couldn't find it now he says enter battle fleek

1889
01:34:53.96 --> 01:35:03.32
completely committed and perhaps you will emerge alive at the end I think that makes some sense for me

1890
01:35:03.32 --> 01:35:08.60
prepare the best of your ability yeah be fully committed and then don't worry about what the

1891
01:35:08.60 --> 01:35:15.56
end's gonna come because you can't control everything I think we're good I think okay now this one

1892
01:35:15.56 --> 01:35:23.000
I had to I had to dig on this one a little bit too samurai study a great many things however the

1893
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:34.92
single focus of their learning is death and then the the the amplifying information here

1894
01:35:36.12 --> 01:35:41.80
is while samurai do intensive training and study a variety of topics what it all boils down to

1895
01:35:41.80 --> 01:35:50.52
is seeking death so that that kind of that one I will I tried to figure out what that meant

1896
01:35:50.52 --> 01:35:57.24
or at least what it means to me and I think to to the most positive way I could

1897
01:35:57.24 --> 01:36:00.60
because seeking death right are you really seeking death is that what you're trying to do?

1898
01:36:00.60 --> 01:36:05.80
Well no if you're you're not helping the cause if you're seeking death right you don't want to die

1899
01:36:06.44 --> 01:36:10.84
that's not our goal it's an occurrence that could happen and matter fact that's gonna happen all of us

1900
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:17.32
but the way I look at it is what we're trying to learn we're trying to understand

1901
01:36:17.32 --> 01:36:27.72
and master his death and the fear of death if we can get over that little little hurdle right then

1902
01:36:27.72 --> 01:36:32.92
you've mastered that and once you're actually saying I'm going forward don't prepare it

1903
01:36:33.64 --> 01:36:41.16
then we're good or could be also just like just you know as far as seeking challenges go you want

1904
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:45.24
to seek one challenge and you want to seek a bigger challenge yeah but he says seeking death bro

1905
01:36:45.24 --> 01:36:51.24
yeah so you're pursuing the ultimate challenge that beats you and I like that

1906
01:36:51.24 --> 01:36:56.04
true what you have a point break come on yes point yes there you go where you know

1907
01:36:56.04 --> 01:37:01.96
boaty he's looking for the the 50 year storm you remember the same thing so he's like I'm

1908
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:05.08
going to be there and all this stuff he's always trying to push the limit all these things

1909
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:12.12
bankruptreats guy I mean all this stuff and you know find the 50 year storm no is it 100%

1910
01:37:12.12 --> 01:37:19.96
knows it in fact I was kind of like his escape from the law catch one of those ways

1911
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:26.20
dies everyone knew it did he really die or was there sequel where you lived he died it was all

1912
01:37:26.20 --> 01:37:30.68
kind of I guess not that you mentioned it first there's room first he click exactly everybody was

1913
01:37:30.68 --> 01:37:35.000
but then they make it people they write it the same movie yeah did you see that one no not bad

1914
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.48
I see what they're doing there you know a little bit too like you could tell they're trying

1915
01:37:39.48 --> 01:37:44.52
target maybe some teenagers or something like that but not bad sat through it glad it wasn't

1916
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:52.28
a waste of time you know some things all right this one again had to had to had to

1917
01:37:52.28 --> 01:37:58.36
dig a little deeper on this one if you were to ask what what is it that concerns a samurai

1918
01:37:59.24 --> 01:38:08.92
the answer is I want to live I want to live okay so to break that down a little bit I

1919
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:15.48
look at the word concerns and what concerns means is worries or troubles it's not yeah I don't think

1920
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:21.16
they're using them more like oh that that concerns me yeah like like it's not saying hey what what

1921
01:38:21.16 --> 01:38:27.56
concerns me or what I'm thinking about it's what I'm worried about what I'm worried about is someone

1922
01:38:27.56 --> 01:38:31.56
that's saying I want to live I want to live yeah that's what they're worried about because

1923
01:38:31.56 --> 01:38:34.76
someone that's saying I want to live and I think you can apply this to a lot of stuff let's

1924
01:38:34.76 --> 01:38:39.96
take negotiation right you get negotiation with somebody if you're saying I want to win this deal I

1925
01:38:39.96 --> 01:38:44.92
want to steal I want to you're out of position of weakness yeah yeah so even in business you can't

1926
01:38:44.92 --> 01:38:47.72
have the position if I want to live I want to live I want to live I want to score this deal

1927
01:38:47.72 --> 01:38:52.44
I want to make I want to get this deal done like no if you're actually negotiating you need to be

1928
01:38:52.44 --> 01:38:57.32
able to walk away from the deal and say no we're done I'm out strangely they say the same thing

1929
01:38:57.32 --> 01:39:05.16
about picking up girls same thing yes if you're all I hope I get this girl I hope get this girl that

1930
01:39:05.16 --> 01:39:10.52
girl doesn't want to be with a guy that's just British red dude yeah the amplification here

1931
01:39:10.52 --> 01:39:15.64
says an answer to the question what do samurai worry about the answer is having the desire to

1932
01:39:15.64 --> 01:39:22.28
extend their own life is something worth regretting samurai who value their own lives are not worth

1933
01:39:22.28 --> 01:39:32.84
a far thing yeah so we've got that's I think you need to be able to set aside that

1934
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:40.92
well I think it applies to everything I think so yeah if you're so concerned like in

1935
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:46.60
jiu jitsu if you're just totally concerned about winning and not tapping out yeah you're not going to learn

1936
01:39:46.60 --> 01:39:51.32
yeah and and even worse you're not going to compete you're not even rolling that's going to do well yeah

1937
01:39:51.32 --> 01:40:00.60
and you're so apprehensive and yeah yeah to play so I sure sure here's a good one it is important to

1938
01:40:00.60 --> 01:40:10.12
understand that should the mirror in a samurai's heart be unclouded then the opponent will be clearly

1939
01:40:10.12 --> 01:40:21.16
reflected in it good one amplification any samurai whose will is firm can be described as having

1940
01:40:21.16 --> 01:40:28.44
a mind that is unclouded so if your will is firm think about that if your will is firm you can be

1941
01:40:28.44 --> 01:40:34.12
described as having a mind that is unclouded in such a state the strength of weakness of the opponent

1942
01:40:34.12 --> 01:40:48.92
will be perfectly reflected next samurai cast off thoughts of both life and death their mind is set

1943
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:56.76
unmoving forward amplification samurai do not dwell even for a moment on whether they live or die

1944
01:40:58.04 --> 01:41:05.48
fulfilling their mission requires samurai to advance it is what they do best what they were made for

1945
01:41:08.28 --> 01:41:12.36
yeah that is I think that that one breaks down to

1946
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:19.000
you being able to clear your mind on what happened the last go around right not worried about

1947
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.16
the future not worried about the black one you're doing something like if you're competing

1948
01:41:24.28 --> 01:41:28.04
you make a mistake you have to put that out of your brain completely yeah and you need to

1949
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:32.68
okay the mistake happened or you did something great you can't jump up and now to be all happy about

1950
01:41:32.68 --> 01:41:39.40
that you need to just clear your mind and keep the mind empty yeah you can't get freaked out about

1951
01:41:39.40 --> 01:41:45.72
the next shot or the last shot yeah you we learn that in shooting like this is something you see

1952
01:41:45.72 --> 01:41:50.52
all the time when we're shooting we do a little basically when you're shooting in the teams everything

1953
01:41:50.52 --> 01:41:54.68
is a competition and you'd see a guy you're shooting ahead plates and they'd have six

1954
01:41:54.68 --> 01:41:58.68
head plates in a row what's the steel plate about the size of a head and you got a shoot

1955
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:02.52
a minute and we shoot it you instantly know if you hit a risk because it was ping ping ping ping ping

1956
01:42:02.52 --> 01:42:10.20
mm and if you see a guy that can't put the last one out of their head you know it's

1957
01:42:10.20 --> 01:42:20.12
ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping

1958
01:42:21.56 --> 01:42:28.76
mag change it's it's bad yeah a guy gets really good he'll miss and just he'll dismiss and he

1959
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:35.08
doesn't even think about it you're you're ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping

1960
01:42:35.08 --> 01:42:42.28
you just yeah no no factor yeah it's it is the proverbial choking you know like why is this

1961
01:42:42.28 --> 01:42:47.16
good choking at the end on the ceiling it before you can train your mind to do that you can train

1962
01:42:47.16 --> 01:42:51.88
your mind to do that so where you're just and actually when I'd be shooting a lot I could get to that

1963
01:42:51.88 --> 01:42:57.16
point and then if I'm not shooting a bunch I would lose that and I'm gonna be like to ping

1964
01:42:57.16 --> 01:43:01.40
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1965
01:43:01.40 --> 01:43:05.88
if you're shooting regularly you get that you get past that and then older you get the more you

1966
01:43:05.88 --> 01:43:11.72
do it the more you can just say you don't don't care you know what a phrase would would always work

1967
01:43:11.72 --> 01:43:16.20
with me when someone like you've got a coach or something where you know in football you'd have

1968
01:43:16.20 --> 01:43:20.52
this where you're like you'd be winning the whole game mm-hmm you know and in the fourth quarter

1969
01:43:20.52 --> 01:43:24.52
it's like oh my god we just let's run out the clock or I don't you have that feeling

1970
01:43:24.52 --> 01:43:28.20
and guys at choke a lot of time and that's not to mention the other teams thinking the exact

1971
01:43:28.20 --> 01:43:31.16
opposite we got nothing lose we're gonna hit him we're gonna take risks we're gonna do all

1972
01:43:31.16 --> 01:43:36.68
you know so that's why guys can win or teams can win at the last minute even though they've been

1973
01:43:36.68 --> 01:43:42.20
getting their ass kicked old game um fights kind of like that too but I don't know if I just seem

1974
01:43:42.20 --> 01:43:45.56
to have like more of a wheel I don't know for some reason but either way either way I don't know

1975
01:43:46.84 --> 01:43:51.64
but the phrase I would always help me is if someone would just put your might to end say finish

1976
01:43:51.64 --> 01:43:56.04
strong just say finish strong but like yeah it's almost like they're gonna say punch it through

1977
01:43:56.04 --> 01:44:01.72
or something you know something like that that indicates don't let up at the end mentally you know

1978
01:44:01.72 --> 01:44:07.08
just go just keep pushing the way you but that is a little bit different then getting distracted by

1979
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:11.48
what just happened yeah but because they say yeah it is a little bit different but in it's like

1980
01:44:11.48 --> 01:44:15.32
what's your critical role when you played football what was it you were trying to do each play

1981
01:44:16.20 --> 01:44:20.04
were you weren't you a receiver yeah okay so let's say you missed their catch that you should

1982
01:44:20.04 --> 01:44:24.76
cut off you had to be able to put that out of your head right so it's just a mental state

1983
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:30.52
where it's like finished strong it's finished strong in your mind you know so yeah don't worry

1984
01:44:30.52 --> 01:44:35.56
about your introduce it to get this all the time man when I'd win a match and then I'd win another

1985
01:44:35.56 --> 01:44:41.32
one you know you gotta win like matches till the final after two matches I just start feeling this

1986
01:44:41.32 --> 01:44:45.72
pressure like it's almost like one way my two match win streak is about to come to an end it's a

1987
01:44:45.72 --> 01:44:48.84
little like the pressure and then you win one more and then the pressure is even on more

1988
01:44:48.84 --> 01:44:54.84
is weird it's like I wish I was done it is weird oh but if someone would say something along

1989
01:44:54.84 --> 01:44:58.92
the lines of finished strong it would just cure the whole thing because you're thinking about all

1990
01:44:58.92 --> 01:45:03.88
these things that mentally throw you off if I don't know the pressure would say if you could

1991
01:45:03.88 --> 01:45:08.92
somebody say something to you that would make you freak out even more yeah oh yeah like what

1992
01:45:08.92 --> 01:45:14.68
would it freak out more if someone said oh you got this or if someone says hey at least you made

1993
01:45:14.68 --> 01:45:20.12
it this far would you then back off but because when you're dealing with kids it would you know

1994
01:45:20.12 --> 01:45:25.40
like I mean like I got kids you got kids too but you know when you got kids that are doing something

1995
01:45:25.40 --> 01:45:31.48
competitive yeah like you did you do a wrestling and let's say they're winning and and you could tell

1996
01:45:31.48 --> 01:45:37.32
them hey you've done good so far go out there and have fun which is cool yeah or you could say

1997
01:45:37.32 --> 01:45:41.24
hey you need to focus more now but because these people are gonna be getting tougher yeah

1998
01:45:41.24 --> 01:45:47.64
both of those to me with throw me up because when you say just relax you've made it this far that

1999
01:45:47.64 --> 01:45:51.88
tells them that it's okay it did not to be to check out you know so it depends on what their

2000
01:45:51.88 --> 01:45:55.56
state of mind is to go into that that comment or take into the situation where you say

2001
01:45:55.56 --> 01:46:01.64
come to the time I feel like I want to tell people either people I'm coaching well no I

2002
01:46:01.64 --> 01:46:06.52
shouldn't say that when I want to tell my kids relax go out there have fun go out there have a good

2003
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:11.16
time yeah because I think that is easier on their brains and and to what your point was earlier

2004
01:46:11.16 --> 01:46:17.88
when people let loose and they they don't feel the pressure they tend to perform better yeah

2005
01:46:18.92 --> 01:46:25.96
yeah I agree with that fully but if it's like if that's like kind of the underlying attitude like

2006
01:46:25.96 --> 01:46:31.000
relax have fun regardless of what Matt first match last finals match whatever then yes I think so

2007
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
but if it's like come on you you got this will you can do this you can do this and then right when

2008
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.76
it gets to the final then you say okay yeah you need this far so it's like your side that's bad I think

2009
01:46:40.76 --> 01:46:45.80
he can be bad you know how they take it but if they take it like I didn't say relax yeah I said go

2010
01:46:45.80 --> 01:46:51.08
out there and have I go out there and do what you do I say that a lot okay so if you say you made it this far

2011
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:56.84
MMA find to be like hey do what you do that's good to say if someone told me that go do what you

2012
01:46:56.84 --> 01:47:01.08
do that would really be in the garden go do what you do yeah that's good stuff to say to me

2013
01:47:01.08 --> 01:47:07.80
but anything to put pressure on me like if you do this you win like you know like one more

2014
01:47:07.80 --> 01:47:12.36
match and that's it no but I'll tell you what's interesting like with coaching MMA if you would

2015
01:47:12.36 --> 01:47:18.04
get a guy and get it into a guy's head do not get taken down and they'd go in there without you

2016
01:47:18.04 --> 01:47:22.52
you'd be really hard to take that person down yeah and when and you'd say it soon if you get taken

2017
01:47:22.52 --> 01:47:26.76
down it's soon before you even get on the ground you get back up you get that people with that

2018
01:47:26.76 --> 01:47:30.92
mind that going and it'd be really hard for someone to take them down and hold them up because they can panic it

2019
01:47:30.92 --> 01:47:39.08
yeah maybe basically pick up get you know yeah so interesting here's a good one

2020
01:47:40.04 --> 01:47:48.36
and this is actually the last one fittingly not engaging in any form of study will cause your

2021
01:47:48.36 --> 01:48:00.20
mind to wander this will result in your spirit becoming unfocused then the amplification there is

2022
01:48:00.20 --> 01:48:05.40
nothing wrong with daydreaming but if you study your spirit will become focused on and shape

2023
01:48:05.40 --> 01:48:13.48
to deal with a certain thing that shape will then become lost in turn there is a song that

2024
01:48:13.48 --> 01:48:19.72
goes the drifting and becoming lost is what the mind does it becomes your spirit the mind of your

2025
01:48:19.72 --> 01:48:33.08
spirit do not allow your mind to do this and yeah I think that that's that's something that we

2026
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:42.44
actually talk about all the time in fact that may be the very purpose of me doing everything that we do

2027
01:48:42.44 --> 01:48:52.28
which is you know studying and learning and to go back to the question that that Eric the

2028
01:48:52.28 --> 01:48:59.56
translator posed to me can any of the rules in this book apply to modern warfare as I said not only

2029
01:48:59.56 --> 01:49:05.08
do they apply to modern warfare they apply to life and the thing is there's nothing really new here

2030
01:49:05.08 --> 01:49:15.56
right just like an arm lock there's nothing really new here but that doesn't mean that there's

2031
01:49:15.56 --> 01:49:21.64
nothing really new here there's always something new we sure we've heard these lessons before right

2032
01:49:22.20 --> 01:49:27.000
we've heard them from dick winners we've heard them from Bob Hoffman we've heard them from general

2033
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:36.44
patent and hack worth and we heard them from wooden leg and I said this on the first podcast that we did

2034
01:49:37.16 --> 01:49:47.32
the first podcast that we did I said you know what to do you know to be balanced

2035
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:53.24
and you know to work out and you know not to be gluttonous with food and you know you should

2036
01:49:53.24 --> 01:50:00.92
sleep late and you know you should keep things clean and organized and you know that your struggles

2037
01:50:00.92 --> 01:50:14.44
now will be rewarded in the future so you must endure indoor indoor the hardship indoor the suffering

2038
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:24.76
indoor the pain of discipline indoor the pain of discipline so that in the future you can have

2039
01:50:24.76 --> 01:50:34.20
the reward and we know what that reward is the reward for discipline is freedom

2040
01:50:34.20 --> 01:50:53.88
and I think that is all I've got for tonight so echo speaking of rewards and freedom and trying to

2041
01:50:53.88 --> 01:51:01.32
get better do you have any suggestions on maybe some ways to get better for people

2042
01:51:01.32 --> 01:51:08.28
sure ways that might also at the same time simultaneously support this podcast if people want to

2043
01:51:08.28 --> 01:51:15.96
sure do something like that they want to also I think it is important and beneficial to add that

2044
01:51:15.96 --> 01:51:21.40
you know when you endure the suffering pain that's metaphor for the most part sometimes it's

2045
01:51:21.40 --> 01:51:29.24
real pain oh yeah and suffering real real but you do that enough and you get used to it

2046
01:51:29.24 --> 01:51:34.12
and to the point where you kind of like require it in a way like you kind of want to like you know

2047
01:51:34.12 --> 01:51:43.40
how are you still going like you know like a strict diet and I'd be hungry a lot but at the

2048
01:51:43.40 --> 01:51:49.08
same time the diet would be really effective with a good workout program and then so when I go off

2049
01:51:49.08 --> 01:51:53.40
the program you kind of you know you feel kind of almost like for lack of better term like toxic like

2050
01:51:53.40 --> 01:52:00.68
or just a sack of you know you almost I kind of miss that hunger and the you know the

2051
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:04.84
because you kind of associate the hunger that you always have with like being in good shape and

2052
01:52:04.84 --> 01:52:09.40
and like a proper point it kind of like that's an example of like how it can be you know you know

2053
01:52:09.40 --> 01:52:12.92
like yeah no that's good you're eating a lot I don't know it's weird you don't even have to

2054
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:18.44
amplify you do it like when you're on the program yeah kind of feels good that you're on the

2055
01:52:18.44 --> 01:52:23.48
program you're suffering for sure there's something called unquote suffering there but they feel good

2056
01:52:23.48 --> 01:52:30.28
and especially when you think about the opposite of that which is when you're off the program

2057
01:52:30.28 --> 01:52:37.72
yes and you feel like a wrap yeah and yeah what do you do to make yourself feel better what do you

2058
01:52:37.72 --> 01:52:43.16
do instead of going on the program you said you go to the you go to the sleeve orios yeah that's

2059
01:52:43.16 --> 01:52:47.80
the answer yeah because that's like that's the that's the wrong answer yeah that's the good that's the

2060
01:52:47.80 --> 01:52:55.24
instant gratification yeah right that's the opposite of struggling now yeah you're you're you're

2061
01:52:55.24 --> 01:53:00.60
you're you're not enduring now you're not facing the pain of discipline now you're looking for

2062
01:53:00.60 --> 01:53:04.84
a short term rewards so that's why that's why I said it said in the book I said in the book

2063
01:53:04.84 --> 01:53:10.28
the field manual right like when you're on the path it's it's easier to stay on the path I

2064
01:53:10.28 --> 01:53:16.76
when you fall off the path yeah yeah people people just get they go the downward spiral yeah that's

2065
01:53:16.76 --> 01:53:21.64
like you fall for the trick and this I have mentioned this as a trick you're my trick so like you

2066
01:53:21.64 --> 01:53:27.32
like that you're getting it is friends you know when you you fall off the path you say and when you

2067
01:53:27.32 --> 01:53:33.16
feel like crap because you're off the program and the fact that you're off the program aside from just

2068
01:53:33.16 --> 01:53:38.04
your physical physicality you feel like crap so you got to alleviate that feeling so you go to

2069
01:53:38.04 --> 01:53:42.68
something that's gonna give you pleasure but forget what wrong pleasure you and short term when you

2070
01:53:42.68 --> 01:53:48.12
need it long term you know so that's what you do that is a good a good thing I do that when

2071
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:55.08
let's say don't feel I've been traveling been eating crap the way to get back on

2072
01:53:55.80 --> 01:54:01.56
the way to feel good again is just to hit yourself I mean get some screw get some do good

2073
01:54:01.56 --> 01:54:08.04
can have a good couple base like uh you know in the in the field menu I've got these various

2074
01:54:08.04 --> 01:54:16.04
workouts and there's some of those in there that are just core not core as an abs because we call it

2075
01:54:16.04 --> 01:54:23.64
but but core programs that are fundamental yeah and I kind of know where I'm at on them and even

2076
01:54:23.64 --> 01:54:29.88
if I'm not gonna go in there do a record performance it'll put me back on track it'll make it'll

2077
01:54:29.88 --> 01:54:38.60
it'll clean my system mentally and physically yeah and that's good probably stick to this thing where

2078
01:54:39.80 --> 01:54:44.68
you know if you're you have a girlfriend you get in a fight or something like that or they break

2079
01:54:44.68 --> 01:54:49.32
up with you whatever you know something that makes you in a bad mood for whatever it's in

2080
01:54:49.32 --> 01:54:54.84
they should go to the gym and do like shoulders or chest workouts something that would give like a

2081
01:54:54.84 --> 01:55:00.68
really really hard painful pump you know that kind like I don't know 12 15 reps like a minute in

2082
01:55:00.68 --> 01:55:06.76
between like eight sets of those massively pumped for some reason I just feel way better that's the

2083
01:55:06.76 --> 01:55:13.64
same thing that's what I'm talking about yeah the way if you can give yourself for me you got your

2084
01:55:13.64 --> 01:55:17.96
you got some workouts that are just fundamental I don't know what there's their probably a name for like

2085
01:55:17.96 --> 01:55:24.20
medicine yeah medicine yeah medicine some medicine workouts you got to have some of those medicine

2086
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:30.68
workouts that just put you back on the path yeah and then you know what do you fast 24 hours

2087
01:55:31.40 --> 01:55:37.56
that's bold right there yeah 24 hours you feel you feel good I'm telling you feel good

2088
01:55:38.28 --> 01:55:43.56
yeah I'll do like 15 now actually pretty often too and you're right strangely you're right

2089
01:55:43.56 --> 01:55:51.96
I just read another article some of the pages I read two articles because people people tweet

2090
01:55:51.96 --> 01:55:56.28
them to me yeah one of them was about the intermittent fasting we guess what it's good for you

2091
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:04.28
and then the other one was about this whole depletion of will is I'll not true yeah well the I think

2092
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:09.24
why I was right the scientists were wrong what they were saying I think with what you're saying

2093
01:56:09.24 --> 01:56:13.56
I think there's like a slide no no no no no no so you're saying it's straight up wrong what

2094
01:56:13.56 --> 01:56:19.96
there's no no there's I just read an article today that is wrong that this idea of the depletion

2095
01:56:19.96 --> 01:56:28.12
of you know if you if you have to resist this chocolate chip cookie then within 20 minutes you won't

2096
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:31.96
be able to resist the cake because you just can't resist that much yeah it's a lie it's then

2097
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:37.80
there's proving now that it's not true yeah not true yeah I feel like that's a psychological

2098
01:56:37.80 --> 01:56:43.08
state so I might vary from individual but what I'm saying is if you if you're on the program

2099
01:56:43.08 --> 01:56:49.80
yeah and you had some medicine in the morning you I'm telling you that it's easier to hold the

2100
01:56:49.80 --> 01:56:54.92
line the more you hold the line it easier is to hold the line that's true yeah that's the truth

2101
01:56:55.72 --> 01:57:01.88
you get some speaking of holding the holding the line and the truth by the way

2102
01:57:01.88 --> 01:57:11.48
chocolate some supplements jocos supplements cruel oil the main one and joint warfare so

2103
01:57:11.48 --> 01:57:21.24
joint warfare glucosamine and conjroitin and curcumin which is the other there's it's not just glucosamine

2104
01:57:21.24 --> 01:57:27.72
and conjroitin yeah this curcumin yes what is that it's more goodness for the joints

2105
01:57:27.72 --> 01:57:36.60
some stuff to wage warfare against joint inflammation pain yeah so and that's a big deal

2106
01:57:36.60 --> 01:57:41.40
because again I'm gonna say I said it before but I think this is critical I mean you know I'm sure

2107
01:57:41.40 --> 01:57:46.68
there's like supplements that help you build your muscles if you're into building my I'm sure

2108
01:57:46.68 --> 01:57:56.20
there is but really if you can maintain your joints especially if you're due to pushing weights any kind

2109
01:57:56.20 --> 01:58:02.84
of like so I like know that dynamic movement yeah you know because you joints take those that

2110
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:06.84
that front and they degenerate over time oh they do because that would tap me to you

2111
01:58:06.84 --> 01:58:11.80
I'm over here not degenerating I'm on joint warfare you're in a state of generating huh yeah

2112
01:58:11.80 --> 01:58:18.52
I don't know I dig it and this is one of the cruel oil thing I'm not embarrassed because it's kind of

2113
01:58:18.52 --> 01:58:23.40
funny story I might spend some little bit it's not funny funny but it is that I was like

2114
01:58:23.40 --> 01:58:31.64
a girl oh oh to my father and yeah I'm like over here pushing cruel oil like in life I mean you know

2115
01:58:32.36 --> 01:58:37.48
Brian his name is Brian and remember we went to the retreat in Maine from Brian the black belt

2116
01:58:37.48 --> 01:58:43.88
they came I knew him sure so I kind of keep contact with him he's like hey do you have any like

2117
01:58:43.88 --> 01:58:48.44
what's the cool supplements or whatever I was like right you know and I sent him some mine and he was

2118
01:58:48.44 --> 01:58:53.08
I didn't get the report back down like the other day but nonetheless in life I'm straight up pushing

2119
01:58:53.08 --> 01:58:57.48
it like you tell Greg about it all the time I don't think I don't think he'll maybe I get him son

2120
01:58:57.48 --> 01:59:01.000
I don't know but it's like you know look and you get benefits for something yeah and then you're

2121
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.56
like pushing it on other people some people do it with um bro goddingly

2122
01:59:07.88 --> 01:59:16.20
Pikachu sure just various things you know books music why do we do that with music like if you

2123
01:59:16.20 --> 01:59:20.68
you don't like my you know like I'll be like hey listen to this song it's the best song and then

2124
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:24.60
like you don't like it and I'm actually mad at you or you're mad at me because you don't like it

2125
01:59:24.60 --> 01:59:28.44
yeah because I just don't like your music and I know grab well I think we kind of

2126
01:59:28.44 --> 01:59:33.48
created to our identity in a way this kind of what I do with cruel oil part of my identity

2127
01:59:33.48 --> 01:59:39.72
you know it's part of my joints identity I can tell you that and joint warfare good ones also

2142
02:01:12.44 --> 02:01:21.000
small action big green yeah and I kind of got got after the right and so really in theory you're

2143
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.88
19 plus and mining 19 plus kind of cancelled itself okay really but I felt like maybe if you got 19

2144
02:01:27.88 --> 02:01:35.56
I felt like that day I had like 20% you're bringing it like yeah 26 because you weren't

2145
02:01:35.56 --> 02:01:39.88
typically don't wear that right you don't really wear a rashguards you're much you weren't happy

2146
02:01:39.88 --> 02:01:47.08
on the final guillotine no I think it was a coper you literally said I saw that coming yeah

2147
02:01:48.28 --> 02:01:54.36
and that was one of those comments that was meant to kind of deflate my victory

2148
02:01:54.36 --> 02:02:01.32
you know like you saw it coming and it was so obvious and it was just like you I just got lucky

2149
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:06.84
and blah blah and I just I just said yeah definitely I'm really telegram about what I didn't say

2150
02:02:06.84 --> 02:02:10.68
you got I can't believe how pathetic it was yeah this and you I mean to give you a breakdown

2151
02:02:10.68 --> 02:02:16.04
of your guillotine your guillotine cobra which I think is even more so than the guillotine

2152
02:02:17.32 --> 02:02:21.80
like you have such a good way to like get it you're one of those guys that like you're probably

2153
02:02:21.80 --> 02:02:25.24
walking like right now you're thinking about guillotine right now that's what I think that's what

2154
02:02:25.24 --> 02:02:31.16
it feels a lot so it's like when you go for it it just lands perfectly it's not the kind where you

2155
02:02:31.16 --> 02:02:38.52
know oh no just grab it no no no no just so it's gotten to the point over literally like what

2156
02:02:39.40 --> 02:02:44.92
like almost a decade of training with you and that thing getting sunk in that efficiently on

2157
02:02:44.92 --> 02:02:53.80
my own name you're not that far from the truth it's like my body like knows like hey we've been

2158
02:02:53.80 --> 02:02:58.20
here before this one my brain is almost like I can feel my brain as a separate entity tell

2159
02:02:58.20 --> 02:03:04.28
my body sometimes if I get you in a guillotine and you go crazy trying to defend it and then like

2160
02:03:04.28 --> 02:03:09.56
and you'll get out and the next one I'll be like yeah it's going down yeah it's like man I don't

2161
02:03:09.56 --> 02:03:13.96
want that beef again because what what I what I had to do to get out of that first one is like

2162
02:03:13.96 --> 02:03:19.32
bro I can't do something about it yeah it's not worth it that's exactly what it is and I think

2163
02:03:19.88 --> 02:03:25.000
that's how my whole body reacts when I feel it gets sunk in it's kind of common man this again

2164
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.04
we've been down this road same outcome you know my body is used to that outcome so it just kind of

2165
02:03:30.04 --> 02:03:34.36
accommodates it that's what it feels like and I think that's part of what I meant but it's like I

2166
02:03:34.36 --> 02:03:39.16
saw that coming I think your body is okay with me getting you I think so too I don't like the fact

2167
02:03:39.16 --> 02:03:46.92
that it's like that I don't like I think I think talking about it might help or it might

2168
02:03:46.92 --> 02:03:53.56
straight up not yeah rash guards geese made in America which is awesome so that's awesome

2169
02:03:54.12 --> 02:03:58.68
yeah everyone should know that and they make them like make them yes yes they don't like

2170
02:03:58.68 --> 02:04:04.92
shipping some stuff and then hey guys okay are we starting to make yeah even though it's been you know

2171
02:04:04.92 --> 02:04:11.56
yeah they make or make it from the thread and the ghee the ghee is good that's the video's coming out

2172
02:04:11.56 --> 02:04:18.76
yeah it's out the origin that's out the video Megan like I'm making confused with the

2173
02:04:19.48 --> 02:04:25.32
Amanda by the way hold on story I won't go into it right now nonetheless videos out

2174
02:04:25.96 --> 02:04:31.48
making made the video it's a good one actually you kind of made the video to you right now what

2175
02:04:31.48 --> 02:04:39.72
listen they make anything nonetheless joccus geese out other geese on origin all good I got two

2176
02:04:39.72 --> 02:04:45.56
other ones so three origin geese all together me it's only geese all everywhere I think

2177
02:04:47.08 --> 02:04:52.28
unless someone else can make their own material in America and you know provide the same

2178
02:04:52.28 --> 02:04:57.24
everything then hey maybe maybe not but just saying as of right now that's how it is also

2179
02:04:57.24 --> 02:05:04.76
no kettlebells right I'm gonna keep you updated on my kettlebell situation I'm addicted to

2180
02:05:04.76 --> 02:05:09.80
I'm addicted to them collecting and doing them so I got one more that's the Cyclops from on it

2181
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:17.40
the designer one no no what do you call it the regulation regular ones none of those anyway Cyclops

2182
02:05:17.40 --> 02:05:23.16
I think is 40 something pounds I only got one I'm getting out of joke with that one too anyway

2183
02:05:23.16 --> 02:05:31.08
the good thing about these is they are balanced because a lot of times and from what I here I

2184
02:05:31.08 --> 02:05:34.84
don't know but from what I hear like a lot of the design ones they're not balanced

2185
02:05:35.40 --> 02:05:43.000
you know these are balanced and that's the ones I use and I'm addicted to the workout

2186
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.40
starts low with these when you do it though are you still doing a lot of kettlebells yeah I do

2187
02:05:47.40 --> 02:05:51.96
decent amount of kettlebells yeah doing some Turkish get-ups the other day yeah right I didn't get that

2188
02:05:51.96 --> 02:05:59.48
I thought I was gonna get really into Turkish get-ups but I did a few times and just you didn't it didn't stick you

2189
02:05:59.48 --> 02:06:04.52
know you know you know understand stuff just sticks even though it's cool you know what it was I did it

2190
02:06:04.52 --> 02:06:09.96
with the 35 pound one then I did it with the 54 pound one and I was like 10 this is a good exercise

2191
02:06:09.96 --> 02:06:13.64
hard and then I went online to look up exercises and then there's ones with guys doing it with

2192
02:06:13.64 --> 02:06:20.36
185 pounds like doing it and maybe maybe I just got discouraged I got encouraged do I see that oh yeah

2193
02:06:20.36 --> 02:06:25.000
you take it it's like a challenge yeah yeah maybe my whole outlook is different

2194
02:06:25.96 --> 02:06:31.88
anyway when you do these kettlebells if you want the cool ones to me kettlebells or dope but if you

2195
02:06:31.88 --> 02:06:37.24
want them extra dope you go to on it dot com slash jockel get your kettlebells there just look at them

2196
02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:44.44
they got light ones everyone's I say start light but hey whatever your level is you know get them

2197
02:06:44.44 --> 02:06:56.12
also when you get your copy of what is the the translated hundred rules of war yes we get this again

2198
02:06:56.12 --> 02:07:02.60
yeah which I'm pronouncing it all sorry yeah see and that's really great and okay so I put these

2199
02:07:02.60 --> 02:07:06.92
books all these books if you didn't already I'm going to say again I put all the books on our website

2200
02:07:06.92 --> 02:07:12.20
jockepotcast.com and this is for this very reason jockeot has no how to pronounce some of this stuff

2201
02:07:12.20 --> 02:07:18.04
no especially the Japanese stuff you know you come to me for help I help it's not a smooth

2202
02:07:18.04 --> 02:07:23.000
process is what I'm saying so I tried to smooth out a little bit jockepotcast.com on the

2212
02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:28.84
so on the website jockepotcast.com good way to support also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't

2213
02:08:28.84 --> 02:08:35.48
already on iTunes to just stitch your google play Spotify is that a

2214
02:08:35.48 --> 02:08:39.88
no I don't you spot a fact Spotify is not you can't get I don't I don't think you can get it

2215
02:08:39.88 --> 02:08:44.60
but there's a bunch any podcasting platform I don't think Spotify is one of them we had a request

2216
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:49.64
for Spotify because then you could play it on Alexa but I can you can play it on Alexa right now

2217
02:08:49.64 --> 02:08:55.64
you can say Alexa play the latest jockel podcast actually in not to split here is what it's

2218
02:08:55.64 --> 02:09:02.28
called amazon echo Alexa's just the name you say yeah but Alexa's what you say yeah so that's what I said

2219
02:09:02.28 --> 02:09:10.28
no you said you can get it on Alexa oh okay technically on the difference I just want us to go in

2220
02:09:10.28 --> 02:09:16.92
correct and insane and doing the right thing that's all nonetheless subscribe if you haven't already

2221
02:09:16.92 --> 02:09:22.12
is it's supposed to put it this way I'm not saying subscribe I'm saying subscribing is a good way to support

2222
02:09:22.68 --> 02:09:28.20
also on youtube subscribe to the youtube channel put some videos on there excerpts not as many excerpts as

2223
02:09:28.20 --> 02:09:34.76
I did last week this week because I got I learned this new video thing we talked about earlier I won't

2224
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:43.64
go into it but I want it's really technical but I wound up getting obsessed with it so like for

2225
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:48.52
I think it was like 11 hours a day for three days I'm making this clip that's like three seconds long

2226
02:09:48.52 --> 02:09:55.32
today so I didn't get to the excerpts is what I'm saying but as a result I think there's I think

2227
02:09:55.32 --> 02:10:00.76
the next video that it releases gonna have some new things to it might be something that only I'm noticing

2228
02:10:00.76 --> 02:10:07.32
maybe maybe not but nonetheless that's gonna be how it is either way point there is subscribe to youtube

2229
02:10:08.04 --> 02:10:16.68
it's a good way to support yeah I want to do a youtube live figure how to do that

2230
02:10:17.40 --> 02:10:23.40
yeah that's not that hard so let's do it just a youtube live random yeah like a facebook live

2231
02:10:23.40 --> 02:10:27.88
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because I think it'd be cool to be stored on youtube instead of

2232
02:10:27.88 --> 02:10:33.24
stored on facebook right yeah I think it's just the matter of it's it doesn't matter ultimately it's

2233
02:10:33.24 --> 02:10:39.80
just a video yeah but if it's if it's stored on on youtube people can go back and be reading it

2234
02:10:39.80 --> 02:10:45.08
and whatever and well I started watching it if it's on facebook it's way buried in some random

2235
02:10:45.08 --> 02:10:50.68
yeah yeah yeah your your feet yeah what do you call it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah time line whatever

2236
02:10:50.68 --> 02:10:59.64
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nonetheless youtube does it good on to subscribe

2237
02:10:59.64 --> 02:11:04.28
got some other videos aside from just the video version of this podcast that's the good that's the

2238
02:11:04.28 --> 02:11:08.60
main reason I think to subscribe if you're interested in that kind of stuff and you can sign

2239
02:11:08.60 --> 02:11:13.16
you know you can get a notification if you don't you don't need it but you can go on also

2240
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:20.52
joc was a store it's called jocl store jocl store dot com got some new stuff under straight up

2241
02:11:21.72 --> 02:11:27.72
rash guards who these are up I know I've been saying it but they're up though is one of my

2242
02:11:27.72 --> 02:11:36.20
hats got some hats I am putting beanies on there oh yes that's good yes yeah okay I hope

2243
02:11:36.20 --> 02:11:43.000
they're thick beanies they're regular I didn't know there's nothing I've been you know doing some

2244
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.84
research this is a good beany okay from all I kind of extrapolated all the you know they advice

2245
02:11:49.48 --> 02:11:55.16
online and these are the good ones also some new rash guards k the new rashguard is

2246
02:11:57.64 --> 02:12:02.20
a rashguard that says small action on one side big reaction on the other side

2247
02:12:02.20 --> 02:12:11.88
when I work for the first time a healing tailor said he didn't know he didn't know the layers

2248
02:12:12.28 --> 02:12:18.36
but he saw it and he was like the essence of jiu jitsu because it is right just my action

2249
02:12:18.36 --> 02:12:24.28
big reactions what we're hoping for yeah it's just in killing jiu dokeling yeah he knew he knows about the

2250
02:12:24.28 --> 02:12:32.84
way also some women stuff on there which is cool I think some patches on there sure it's I'm

2251
02:12:32.84 --> 02:12:37.56
gonna have a new shirt coming out I don't have a new shirt you have a new shirt coming out

2252
02:12:38.44 --> 02:12:44.76
do I know what it is nope interesting not yet a lot of times I'll get input from the online

2253
02:12:44.76 --> 02:12:49.96
people from the people and I kind of you know every most of the time it's like one off things you

2254
02:12:49.96 --> 02:12:54.52
know like oh I heard jocos say this one thing this is one time back then I really liked it

2255
02:12:54.52 --> 02:12:58.52
we would make a great shirt kind of thing and I'm although they're usually right a lot of times

2256
02:12:58.52 --> 02:13:03.32
and they can maybe that might not translate into your real picky and choosey is what I'm here

2257
02:13:03.32 --> 02:13:08.20
yeah put it this way a lot of people after hitting me with it okay and this is one of those

2258
02:13:08.20 --> 02:13:14.12
I have actually mentioned it before it's called back to the book I think it's coming out good

2259
02:13:14.12 --> 02:13:21.72
anyway that one's coming out to jocob store jocob store dot com take a look at this stuff on there

2260
02:13:21.72 --> 02:13:27.72
if you see something you like get something also psychological warfare on all of our this

2261
02:13:27.72 --> 02:13:34.44
is what psychological warfare is on all of our journeys I'm going back to journeys

2262
02:13:36.04 --> 02:13:39.32
someone requested something the other day and it was actually better than campaign or journey

2263
02:13:39.32 --> 02:13:44.20
but I forget what it was so it's better just not that much better no it's better but I can't remember

2264
02:13:44.20 --> 02:13:51.08
I see a lot of stuff that's true you do see a lot of stuff well on our campaign against weakness journey

2265
02:13:51.96 --> 02:13:58.36
everyone's while we're running to roadblocks points of weakness hopefully less than more

2266
02:13:58.36 --> 02:14:02.36
more times than not we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't

2267
02:14:02.36 --> 02:14:11.56
very clear hopefully not very often but one the unfricquint time comes where you run into those

2268
02:14:11.56 --> 02:14:17.88
weaknesses you said unfricquint time but it's cool we know what you mean bro the not frequent

2269
02:14:17.88 --> 02:14:24.28
yeah the rare time that you run into weaknesses do not worry because psychological warfare is an

2270
02:14:24.28 --> 02:14:29.56
album with tracks that helps you right through that most situations pretty much all situations really

2271
02:14:29.56 --> 02:14:36.60
weak and up early skipping workouts procrastination staying on the program diet why is all this

2272
02:14:36.60 --> 02:14:41.72
stuff a lot of stuff a bunch of tracks on there and it's jockel telling you pragmatically ways that you can

2273
02:14:42.28 --> 02:14:48.76
practice with practical right practical meaning you can practice these things it's not just some

2274
02:14:48.76 --> 02:14:56.68
philosophical slash inspirational stuff I would say do yeah it's more due practical it's kind of the

2275
02:14:56.68 --> 02:15:03.72
teamwork for it but nonetheless practical advice coming directly from jockel directly into your ear

2276
02:15:03.72 --> 02:15:09.000
on why you shouldn't give in to these weaknesses it's like a little spot in your campaign that's

2277
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:14.04
what psychological warfare is it's a good one it's a real good one another's that is a number one

2278
02:15:14.04 --> 02:15:19.96
spoken word albums on iTunes for about nine months and they finally got beaten out by another album

2279
02:15:19.96 --> 02:15:28.68
it was read on field manual which is people keep asking me it's available as an album with

2280
02:15:28.68 --> 02:15:35.72
tracks on iTunes Amazon music google play on other MP3 platforms also on Amazon you can get jockel

2281
02:15:35.72 --> 02:15:41.88
white tea what's good about jockel white tea is if you drink jockel white tea you are guaranteed
