yeah gets worse by the way within a few days of his performance at moderate where he confirms the worst the worst fears of his critics and even more disastrous battle of makers foretimes makers fun time sorry to the people of South Africa to the Afrikaans I'm sorry makers fun time especially for a Dutch guy should be doing a little bit better the boars were concealed in a narrow in narrow trenches in front of his objective they waited patiently until the British came within easy range surprise was complete when they opened fire hail of lead swept through the ranks of the highland brigade within minutes the ground is carpeted with dead soldiers including the highland commander George O'ow shop who's too much for the remainder despite their training and discipline despite the honor of the regiment despite all the factors which the high command finally believed would induce uneducated soldiers to sacrifice themselves for the short coming of their generals they broke ranks turn tail and fled as they did so they were further pounded and demoralized by hitherto undetected batteries of blue or artillery fast forward a little bit myth you and was by no means the most foolhardy of the generals jah there was general feather stoneaw who at the battle of Belmont insisted on riding up and down in front of his men in full regalia thereby announcing his importance to the enemy and effectively hampering the fire of his own men it was not long before the boo is rectified his error by shooting off shooting them off of his horse there was general heart who at the battle of colenso inflicted 30 minutes parade ground drill on his brigade before marching them shoulder to shoulder in barracks square precision across the open veld against the booer position since it was broad daylight has densely packed column provided an irisistable target for every booer gun and rifle within range this battle in this battle the British were defeated with a loss of 1,139 casualties and ten guns against the booer losses of six dead in 21 wounded fast forward a little bit it is at this point it becomes necessary to introduce another concept which is relevant to the contact of the South African war it is that of the effects of psychological stress upon decision making it is perhaps their resistance to stress and their ability to carry on when things go wrong that good generals are most easily distinguished from poor ones which by the way if you can detach that's what's going to allow you to do that by this standard general bulleter physically so huge failed dismaly it resolute from the outset the three defeats sapt whatever confidence he ever had from being weak and fearful he became a veritable jelly of indecision his plans became vague and indefinite his specific orders scarcely more enlightening his lack of moral courage and the face of adversity revealed itself most clearly in his propensity for making scapegoats of his unfortunate subordinates those admittedly incompetent generals who had blundered on without direction or assistance from above while taking none of the blame himself again the direct antithesis of extreme ownership the nearest to such admission was a reference to bad luck bad luck it may have been but worse luck was to follow in the shape of that 1,400 foot monument to military andeptitude spy and cop the totally unnecessary storming of this mini mountain was to the boor war what the charge of the light brigade had been in the crummy and war the details are as followed while still numbed by the series the defeats just recounted bullards army of 29,000 infantry 2600 mounted men eight field batteries and ten naval guns was enriched if that is the word by the arrival of a fresh division commanded by church sir Charles Warren fast forward a little bit the plan was went wrong for several reasons in the first place warrants division was far too small for the main attack the second reason for disaster lay in the character of Warren who's been described as a deletory yet fidgety overcocious yet is a res allute and totally ignorant regarding the use of cavalry he was also obsessive obstinate self opinionated and excessively bad tempered isn't an interesting how you hear bad tempered a lot when this guy is describing freaking knucklehead leaders this also included an obsession with enormous baggage train and fear that it might be destroyed by a non-existent enemy by non-existent enemy guns on the small mountains spy on cop so concerned was he with his baggage that he spent 26 hours personally supervising its transfer across the river the delay was invaluable to the boor and it's the really the first the first tank battle where tanks were used and this is just so important because there's so much resistance here in 1912 a private civilian inventor e l demol of Adelaide presented the war office with the design for a tracked vehicle which to put it at its simplest would help solve the major tactical problem of the first World War which hadn't even started yet how to get soldiers across no manland, barbed wire and enemy trenches without being shot the war office looked at demol's design and laid it on its on one side and 1915 through a total lack of personal protection British soldiers on the western front were dying at the rate of thousands a day demol was moved to resubmit his invention again it was ignored and by the way he didn't come up with this idea four runners of the tank can be traced back to Caesar's invasion of Britain Leonardo da Vinci had designed an armored fighting vehicle in the 16th century and the concept was advanced by H. G. Wells in his book the land iron clads polished in 1903 remember when I was a kid I saw that you know a road of enchanting I was pretty stoked on that it might be concluded therefore that his invention was put aside not just because it was a new idea which it was not nor because it was not needed which it was but because it conflicted with a mystical belief and the virtues of horse to cavalry and in the power of a prolonged military barrage now we get into some of the politics that was going on about the tanks while Churchill and Lloyd George were enthusiastic supporters of the tanks master general of ordinance general von Donop remained implacably opposed to any such development in the services the major proponents of the tank development included ironically a small group of naval officers the fact that the admiral to felt less quote threatened by tanks than the war office did was strikingly illustrated at one of those demonstrations where in proponents of a new idea strive to convert skeptics by confrontation with evidence of their senses after an impeccable display in which prototype tanks cut through barbed wire cross-chinch trenches slithered through mud and clawed their way out of craters a naval officer was heard to remark we ought to order 3,000 now so the navy guys like hey bro that looks like a pretty freaking good thing but the war office contingent remained cool once senior general retorting who is this damn naval man saying we will want 3,000 tanks he talks like Napoleon him and his detached point of view um they get some tanks they get some of them they use him in battle and and here's what happens of course how do they use him about this is like when you learn an eugenia to move like hey echo you know here's this new move so he kind of thought that we needed to take this this high ground spy on cop seems like a good call the men were ordered up the steeply sloping mountainside into a fog hardly less dense than that which clouded the minds of their commanders when in almost zero visibility they thought they had reached the summit the assault force altered congratulating themselves on the total absence of opposition raised the union track jack and tried to entrench the word the operative word is tried for the top was much like the rest of the mountain solid rock nobody had warned them of this by the way he didn't do a recon just FYI they decided to use sandbags only to find that no one had to remember to bring them while the miscued they did the best they could with pieces of rocks and clouds of earth only to well aware that this flimsy protection provided no overhead cover whatsoever if this gave them food for thought there was more to follow for with a further improvement in visibility they made a second disquieting discovery they were not where they thought they were instead of the summit they found themselves on a small plateau some way below the mountain top 1,700 men on a piece of ground 400 by 500 yards and above them on three sides the boars the enemy opened fire within minute the ground was littered with corpses many with bullet holes in the side of the head or body owing to the lack of overhead cover the losses from shrapnel were even greater trapped in the seemingly hopeless position without any guidance or directives from their general the 200 lane caster fuselures laid down the arms and surrendered to the boars this their place was taken by reinforcement sent up from below meanwhile Warren and Bullard did nothing to help the hard press troops no doubt appalled by what was happening to his army on the heights above Warren supined at the best of times went into a state that has been described as paralytic important note a war correspondent who had witnessed the dire events on top of the mountain hurry down to the commanding general but instead of receiving this admittedly unsolicited information with gratitude Warren flew into a rage and demanded that the journalist should be arrested for insolence name of the war correspondent was Winston Churchill but before moving on to the next example it's worth placing the cramian and boar wars in the same perspective both present a picture of what appears to be unreleaved stupidity but more interesting is the psychological pattern of these events here was a rich and powerful nation anxious to assert assert its rights first in Russia then in South Africa what did it do but send out highly regimented armies which endeavored to make up encouraged discipline and visual splendor what they lacked in relevant training technology and adequate leadership as to the latter in each case a commander in chief was selected who despite his deficiencies remained in order to be popular with his troops for far longer than he deserved both men were genial courteous and kind both were inexperienced is irresolute and lacking moral courage both were rich and well-connected but both when the occasion demanded were only too ready to divest themselves of all responsibility for the errors which they had made and the ones seemed quite unable to learn from the mistakes of the other from the moment it might prove how to keep in mind certain characteristics of the incompetence just described they include so here's as we get into a list of problems number one an underestimation sometimes bordering on the arrogant of the enemy hmm check in equating war with sport yeah it knew it was like he was freaking stoked so um leadership strategy in tactics field manual the code evaluation protocols discipline equals freedom field manual way the warrior can want to three four mickey in the dragons hack worth about face extreme ownership dichotomy leadership we have the leadership company where we

Burke echoes at aquatral's i am at jocca willink and thanks to all the men and the women of the military who are leading not from a psychopathic mind but trying to take care of their people and accomplish the mission and also thanks to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMT's dispatchers correctional officers board of patrol secret service and all first responders thank you for taking care of us by locking up the psychopaths of the world and to everyone else out there take care of your people take care of your people put them first and you don't take care of them by being easy well letting them cut corners or allowing a lack of training and allowing a lack of discipline you take care of them by helping them be the best they can be by helping them be prepared by listening to them by incorporating their ideas and by putting your own agenda and your own aspirations below there first go do that and until next time this is Dave and echo and jocco out okay where are you second dude what are we trying to do we certainly have not good enough troops to make certain of of taking bad debt Baghdad of our two divisions mine the sixth is complete the 12 has no guns or divisional troops and nixon takes them from me and lends him to gornion when he has to go anywhere I consider we ought to hold on to what we've got as long as we are held up as we are in the dardinels all these offensive operations in secondary theaters are dreadful errors in strategy the dardinels egypt messa patini a east africa i wonder and wonder at such expeditions being permitted in violation of all great fundamental principles of four especially the out of economy of force such as the violation is always punished in history so he's any got to prioritize next week why we do run around doing all these different things i'm afraid we are out in the cold here the messa patini and operations are a little noticed though we are fighting the same enemy as you have in the dardinels plus and appalling heat the hardship in France or nothing to that so this seems like a logical thing right towns like hey dude what are we doing like we already kind of got done or supposed to get done why are you pushing further let's hold what we got i don't have a bunch of troops i'm getting my my troops are getting pulled all over the place let's just kind of stand down but it's an interesting um there's another uh story in that writes the letter was completely in character it revealed a gift for strategic appreciation amounting to uh prescience it revealed towns in chronic tendency to criticize his superiors and his obsession with his own affairs to the exclusion of all others it revealed as a bit you will lack of general of generosity to his colleagues who whom he praised only if they were of inferior rank to himself his tendency to wine and almost embarrassing immodesty i think that's a hard reading of that letter and how quickly and this isn't like show the how smart i am it's like how easy it is to make the connection what you preface this was he kind of i think he listed three one was technology i forgot what the first one was and the third one was leadership and really the risk could just be one it's leadership but the title of this book is is the title of book is the psychology of it's the it's the it's the individual's person psychology and when we're talking about these things is how painful it is to sit from the outside and watch the whole that they dig or just how obvious and to your point of detachment how obvious it is it's not nuanced it's not like a slight little adjustment you're just sitting back you're watching this and there is you know there's zero chances it's gonna work not because we know the history but because of because of the setup that you're revealing this is the situation this is how these people make decisions this is the way they think like this is gonna fail this is gonna fail and how easy it is to attribute everything on one of those to a basic fundamental leadership behavior it's disturbing it's disturbing not the least of which is the one that repeats itself more than anything else which is what you talked about at the very beginning was humility just the inability to be humble it's it's it's it's it's hard to listen to you you know we're gonna do that or that's obvious or whatever so literally you know so nice start caring about like you know my the king of wherever and all these other you know personal interest whatever I'm gonna say something that I don't know maybe this makes me a psychopath if I would have been in charge of the British military I would have assembled a hit team and we would have gone and killed towns and like execution style and brought his body back and said hey leaders this is not how we lead into the question you asked too I think given the author's education he's using that term in the clinical sense like that is not like it's not a slang term for a dude is kind of messed up he's calling him he's he's referring to the psychopathic tendencies he means that in the the medical literal sense of that word I I saw this when when we developed and the machine was the example we used last time but when we developed stealth technology and it really became evident to the world and desert storm because nobody really most people didn't really know is going on and all of a sudden first on a desert storm we're flying to the top of Baghdad with airplanes that nobody could see and there was a level of disbelief going on there from the Iraqi defense system as there's bombs going off around them like I hear I hear airplanes those are jet engines flying over her as I can't see them right here them things are blowing up but there was an incapacity to to accept that he was happening because they didn't see it and this doesn't exist well unfortunately one of the byproducts of that was some people were paying attention to that and there's this massive shift from the early 90s to building stealth airplanes we have a bunch of them now guess who else has the rush in the Chinese are you know our primary enemies but the idea of being in a fight was something you can't see which is what's one of the things that stealth allows you to do is one of the most common things that you see when you're in the stair there plane is other people behaving as if you're not there when they know you're there they just can't see you and like well I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing like good lord but because of the machine gun fire which was causing heavy casualties the tanks were on their own with such perfect targets the German gunners opened fire one by one the tanks were hit while the crews worked desperately at the cumbersome gears to drive a zigzag course and the gunners tried to return fire but taking accurate aim in all the pitching and tossing was virtually impossible it was some minutes before the German guns had been pulled out of action but by this time 16 tanks had been destroyed with huge gaping holes in their sides most were on fire and those crew members who had not been killed outright by the blasting shells were burned to death there were no survivors through a pious fast forward through a pious and mistaken belief in the value of horse cavalry and a paralysis thought a case by years of trench warfare the brilliant breakthrough by the tanks was thrown away some ten days later the Germans counterattacked in a matter of hours they recovered much of the ground originally lost the British third army commanded by general Sir Julian being lost 6,000 men taken prisoner some thousands killed or wounded and a vast quantity of guns and other equipment the magnitude of this disaster was directly attributable to a feature of high-level military incompetence seen all too often the ignoring of intelligence reports which did not fit in with the preconceived ideas when at last news of the disaster reached Britain it was naturally assumed that the generals had failed again heg's reputation already low sank to a vanishing point the war cabinet demanded an immediate explanation heg's response was to endorse a report from general being that the third army had not been taken by surprise and that the failure to stem the German breakthrough was due to the shortcomings of those junior officers and CEOs and men who had been involved in the fighting what a freaking savage in the face of so much contrary evidence these views did not impress the critics to stifle further debate the war cabinet called in general smuts and this freaking savage smut stated and they go into what his relationships are he's he's just a just a real piece of shit smut stated higher command army or court command were not to blame everything had been done to meet such an attack he went on to say that the fault lay either with local commanders who might have lost their heads or with those lower down junior officers and CEOs and men of those two alternatives he preferred the latter explanation and so smuts in the fashion of the day blame those least able to answer back the youthful the junior and the dead again what corrections are we now making we're not making any corrections we're like and their and their true self comes out well good place to stop for today and we know we need to be looking on the lookout for people with psychopathic traits and the meantime you know maybe we try and avoid having those traits ourselves maybe we actually try and become something a little bit more positive something good maybe we try and make ourselves better echo Charles just a just little psychopsycopathy apparently from what I understand is it like it's like a thing in your mind like a normal seemingly normal person can be a psych and a clinical psychopath it has less to do with like crazy stuff that they do it's just the inability to if I'm not mistaken to empathize with people that's one of the big problems yes we should because you know what I want I want to be the king of Baghdad for you can discover easy man the thing about lessons learned lessons learned should open your mind not close your mind these guys are lying by the way secretary of state for indian army commander Bosra Joseph Chamberlain cable this statement honor rival wounded honor rival wounded Bosra please telegraph urgently particulars and progress so this guy's saying hey what's going on with the wounded you got and Nixon replies wounded satisfactory the disposed of many likely to recover medical services under circumstances of considerable difficulty worked splendidly but Nixon to admit for you just witnessed the arrival of 4,000 and the the mejade which is a ship with 600 casualties on board and two crammed 13 days and nights on her decks and on the exposed decks of her lighters men lay huddled in pools of blood urine and feces their bodies slime with excrement their wounds crawling with maggots their shattered bones splinted wood from whiskey crates and the handles of trenching tools and their thighs backs and buttocks lepros with source i mean while towns and he's got his guys safely up and cut it well all this is happening these guys are getting slaughter 23,000 casualties and towns ends up their kind of chilling over the period of the siege he evaded he evenced several characteristics it towns and communications were not however confined to those outside cut during the siege he had devoted much attention to issuing of communicates to his troops these were remarkable for three features a flagrant to soil t-tourds towards and criticism of his superiors of thinly veiled contempt for the valiant but unsuccessful relief force and a total absence of gratitude toward those who are losing their lives trying to rescue him towns and was always prepared to abandon his beloved command in the interest of either his own release or his own advancement on March 5th he had again requested promotion this guy's calling he's captured he's freaking in siege after causing himself to be there he's asking him to promote it on April 9th for the second time he had suggested that he should attempt escape to escape from caught and leave his division to its fate you imagine running that up the chain of command and it's guns for the release of himself and his men though he must have known that only he would be allowed to go twice he had sent ingratiating letters to the enemy commander in the field and once had insisted that no attempt be made on the life of an enemy field marshal any doubts to the correct interpretation of these unedifying facts are dispelled by three subsequent events the first is a minor one but nonetheless revealing when towns had learned that that ale mayor's successor Garringe had been promoted to Lieutenant General he burst into tears and wept on the shoulder of a shrinking subaltern because he knew that Garringe's promotion meant none for him the second is the fact that he did leave his division to die as prisoners of the Turks and the third is that neither then nor later did he so much as left a finger to ameliorate their plight for a present purpose as little remains to be said after 147 days towns and food supplies which he'd originally stated would only last a month ran out confident from his exchange with the Turkish commander that he would be treated generously he capitulated on April 19th 1916 and handed his weak starving men over to the not so tender mercy of the Turks then it was where their paths diverged while he was transported in the greatest comfort to Baghdad and then to constant a noble his 13,000 men began their 1,200 mile march across the air and waste and freezing heights of Asia Minor and while he was wind and dined honored and entertained as the personal guest of the Turkish commander in chief his men died in their thousands of starvation dysentery, cholera and typhus and from the whips of their bad tempered Kurdistan guards they died of the heat by day and of cold by night they died because they we read of staying alive dropping out of the column to be set upon by marauding Arabs who have robbed them filled their mouths with sand and stones in all 70% of the British and 50% of the Indian troops perished in captivity but towns in it was spared these sword details for he traveled by train and arrived at Constantinople on June 3rd was met by the general commander of the Turkish army his staff members of the war office in a crowd of respectful locals he felt very flattered he was even more flattered to be entertained later at Constantinople's best restaurant then escorted by a detachment of cavalry to the waterfront where a naval pinnus waited him his baggage staff and servants aboard he sailed 10 miles down the sea of marmarah to the fashionable island of halkey where high on a cliff he took up residence in a comfortable villa that same day in the building the Turks called the hospital those of towns and troops still too ill to march from samara were being allowed by their captors to die in agony there was no treatment for them and very little food and those who found their beds were given an injection of brandly color fluid after which they stopped fouling their beds because they were dead by that same day more than a third of the British troops to whom towns had had vowed he was leaving them only to procure their reparation had died yeah all right this brings us two chapter six which is the first world war and here we go only the most blankered could deny that the first world war exemplified every aspect of high-level military incompetence for sure lack of imaginative leadership inept decisions ignoring of military intelligence under estimation of the enemy delusional optimism and monumental wastage of human resources has surely never had it equal can you imagine looking at what's happening and you see all those things occurring in an age when it has become fashionable to question authority it may well seem strange that a bare 60 years ago a millions of ordinary men living in indescribable conditions could with courage with a courage fortitude and cheerfulness past human comprehension meekly carry out the lethal decisions of well fed generals comfortably housed many miles behind the place where their orders were being translated into several kinds of pointless death a politics for this period found good things to say of some jett some of the generals who took part we are told that haig did the best he could given the conditions of the western front that he was rock-like and tenacious joffery saving grace so it has been said was that he was a skilled politician and the only man with enough prestige to dominate frances allies and to quote a j-p-taylor even served john French was supposed for some time to be a great military leader other views have been less charitable quote stupid obstinate blimps butchers ossified brains and donkeys are just a few of the unkind epitets which have been applied to those who bore upon their immaculate shoulders the responsibility of committing a generation of young men to various forms of mutilation on the battlefield a contemporary expression of this point of view puts it thus it is hard for a connoisseur of bad generalship surveying the gray ways of world war one to sink about anyone commander as especially awful there were dozens on both sides incompetence took several forms these included the implementation of a plan for the disposition of the British expeditionary force that had been devised three years before the outbreak of hostilities and remain unmodified in the light of subsequent events you said this on the last podcast ignore it good god general exclaimed grove on seeing him this is no place for you you must lie down but the kindly warning came to late for even at that moment hope fell back into the speakers arm shot through the chest soon after came the order to retire and general wallpole road back to camp onto the cover of darkness that night the rebels slipped out of the fort and made good their escape the loss the loss the country sustained by the death of will be Douglas Bramley Harrington and of the hundred and odd men uselessly sacrifice to before ruyah was great but the loss of Adrian hope was a cause for national sorrow his death was mourned on the spot by every man in the camp loud and deeply incentives against the opposite stupidity which it caused it general wallpoles on half the expedition was not the first disaster to be too a fall the British army in India 16 years previously in 1842 a catastrophe occurred beside which the events at for ruyah seemed scarcely worth a mention quote the road was strewn with mangled corpses of their comrade's and the stench of death in the air all along the route they had been passing little groups of camp followers starving frostbitten and many of them in a state of gibbering idiocy the afghans not troubling to kill these stragglers had simply stripped them and left the cold to do its work and now the poor wretched were huddling together naked in the snow striving hopelessly to keep warm by the heat of their own bodies there were women and little children among them who pitiously stretched out their hands for help later the afghans were to report with relish that the unhappy fugitives in their blind instinct to perform preserve life a little longer had been reduced to eating the corpses of their fellows but they all died in the end the British retreat from kaboole in the first afghan war was described by field marshaled sur general templar as the quote most disgraceful and humiliating episode in our history of war against the against an Asian enemy up to that time and quote judging from the details of how a British army of 4,500 men was wiped out by what was in comparison with the British strength the handful of afghan tribesmen the field marshal's words were are nothing of an overstatement i'm gonna fast forward a little bit I don't know for getting any worse than that back to the point of this book in conclusion one point demands particular emphasis and the mismanagement of the messa patonian campaign sheer stupidity played a relatively minor role certainly duff was no genius and Nixon was on intelligent but towns and was not men's fates were decided for them not so much by idiots as by commanders with marked psychopathic traits stupidity and ignorance there may have been but it was the ambitious striving of disturbed personalities which accounted for the loss of towns and force in such matters as vanity personal ambition dishonesty lack of compassion towns and was not unique where he differed from others was in possessing charm intelligence and professional expertise in a world of the square the pompous and the desperately unfunny towns and hound a reflection laid light touch but underneath the agreeable veneer they lay a fatal flaw which showed itself in ravenous self destructive hunger for popular acclaim though its origins remain obscure towns and gave the impression of a man who at some time had suffered traumatic damage to a self esteem which resulted in an everlasting need to be loved well that kind of wraps up the world war one phase but there you go you got a smart man a charismatic man a guy with combat experience and a guy with psychopathic traits and we take those first one smart man charismatic man right that guy would breeze through uh officer so you know if we're looking for an officer like this guy's very charismatic he's very intelligent yeah this then was the background of the attitudes of the experties the British army brought to the poor war and you residual doubts about it's unfittedness for the expedition tend to dissipate when one considers the behavior of the generals put in charge the leading character was the commander and chief general sir redverse bullet according to a contemporary description there could be no finer choice for the South African adventure there is no stronger commander in the British army than this remote almost grimly resolute completely independent utterly fearless steadfast and vigorous man big bone square jaw strong minded strong headed smartness sagacity administrative capacity he was born to be a soldier of the very best English type needless to say the best type of all freaking legit right here's the reality unfortunately this assessment was at variance with the facts in all but two particular firstly he wasn't indeed big secondly though sadly lacking in moral courage he was undoubtedly brave when it came to physical danger in this respect as in many others he was not unlike raglan of the kermian war and indeed some other commanders of subsequent years of sir reverse of bullet as he became to be known so instead of his his name is redverse they started calling reverse instead Kruger writes at the risk of marring the contemporary description it should be mentioned that his big bones were particularly well covered especially in the region of his stomach and that is square jaw was not especially apparent above a double chin so this is just like a fat dude and they're trying to make him sound like a badass um what was his attitude like fast forward a little bit bullet loss and you go it's leadership leadership leadership and yet you're gonna see they're not they're not even developing their leaders properly they're making any changes and by the way let me throw this out there I've worked with the brits the freaking brits are outstanding totally the brits are freaking outstanding soldiers there are some of the most professional human beings never even mind military there are some of the most professional human beings have ever interacted with in my life so obviously now they've made some steps but and just just another thought I keep having and this came up for me we talked about it during wars a racket 300 that is is is these are hard stories to listen to these are hard stories for me to sit here as an as an audience member of this podcast listening to you talk about it is to make sure that that we don't fall into the trap of oh this is jacotone the story about a bunch of other incompetent leaders the the ease with which we've we can as leaders especially we get put in charge how easy it is to slide into some of those habits maybe not to this degree maybe not to this magnification but this is not a story to be to be taken about what's wrong and everybody else it's how easy a regular human being can be placed into a position and fall into the trap of being a bad leader through things like humility humility humility humility detachment and that these are tales that that that the lens that you got to look at is is is a mirror as much as anything else like hey do I do Yeah and if and if and if you're going through that sort of mental arm wrestling over the men or the mission or the people and the mission the only way you actually get people to be willing to do that mission is for them to know that you care about them more than yourself and and that's too that's your point is you're not even saying the mission is as important as the people in like in a hierarchy you're saying that if you actually want to be able to accomplish the most difficult things the most difficult missions missions that almost appear unwinnable if you actually want to be able to do that which of course we do we're here to solve solve the problem we're here to complete the mission is to have people willing to do that and the only way to do that is for them to go oh they've actually cares about me more than just getting the check in the block that he knocked this thing out or took care of this one thing or got this mission solves we can tell us boss no time in trying to rid himself of any direct responsibility for the conduct of the war by handing over the reigns to subordinate commanders to to whom he gave no further directives bullet subordinate general mothu and with eight thousand men was very nearly defeated by three thousand booers the few ins objective was the modern river a natural defense line for booers accordingly without any reconnaissance he ordered his troops to make a frontal attack are we starting to get a we start to understand the frontal attack might not be the best move since he could not see the enemy he wrongly assumed that no enemy was there led by their officers the men advanced across the flat and open veled towards the river all went well until they were within easy range of the booers who had concealed themselves with what was subsequently described as a fiendish cunning below the deep banks of the river those of the thewans army who are not killed outright by the sudden blast of fire from the invisible booers spent the day lying prostrate under a scorching sun in a temperature of 110 unable to move forward or back they including the 70 wounded suffered extreme discomfort from thirst and slowly blistering skin the thewans remedy was to direct heavy artillery fire on the booer positions thanks to the ladders use of cover this braj had very little influence on the course of events apart from killing a number of his own troops through faulty range finding it was only under cover of darkness that the British evident eventually withdrew leaving behind 500 dead and wounded I keep falling into his little traps as I'm listening to you and the trap I keep falling into started up like hey here's this guy in charge and he's totally incompetent and he's he's going to relinquish the command of the control this whole responsibility to subordinates and I'm thinking awesome but is this one of those situations where you know how like you're such so ahead of all the competition and your organization or whatever your team or whatever is so big where victory is almost like a foregone conclusion and you start caring about other stuff like you get like these individual self-interest that's spring up because the real goal and the real like worry is kind of like on the back burner now you I think you're right and so the white washing went on to protect armchair generals who in the main have little conception of what the front line was like and had no intention of going there to find out one of those infantry men so blamed was jh Everest during the two days when he and his fellow soldiers were being pushed back by the Germans they had no water to drink and no food to eat at the end of the second day while waiting in a transfer renewed attack Everest went up to his company commander and asked for permission to search for water my request was refused Everest wrote in the letter nonetheless i went over the top and found some water in a mud hole thus ending two days of torture shortly afterwards Everest was wounded and found himself in the australian general hospital at abbeyville but the most bitter pill on top of this was to be blamed for their commanders own mistakes you imagine reading those freaking articles about how jacked up you were another world war one example here chapter eight the siege of cut if the degree of military incompetence is indicated by the ratio of achievement to cost then the activities of expeditionary force d under the command of major general surchalls towns and merit examination firstly there was a 250 mile discrepancy between what was designed to do and what it tried to do secondly the cost of this discrepancy was large to reach cut cost towns in seven thousand casualties during the ensuing siege of further 1600 died attempts to relieve his force accounted for another 23 thousand casualties when he eventually surrendered to the Turks 13 thousand of his troops went into captivity and seven thousand of these died while still prisoners of war all of this went for nothing not one inch of ground or any political advantage nothing that is beyond corpses suffering and ruined reputation so you have this this take place this is an Iraq in Mesopotamia that's the expression in an uh in in South Africa for the bullrewers it's like they're gonna come up with a plan the bullrew makes a plan that's my Afrikaans but that's the kind of people that you're fighting your fighting farmers you're fighting people that work with the land that ride horses that shoot that honk that's who we're fighting against freaking legit legit enemy fast forward a little bit largely because they issued any form of sartorial elegance that means clothing by the way and preferred the wearing of civilian attire dark cloaks and floppy hats to the sorts of uniforms affected by the British the boars were dubbed the rabble of the illiterate peasants and their army utterly ludicrous so these guys were just wearing like what they wore in the field this is like if you went to war with Texas and they showed up wearing freaking leave eyes cowboy hats and rangler shirts but they make bad decisions a lot and people just kind of like can't get mad at him just to just to wrap this section up to conclude this account of the total dissolution of an army on January 13th 1842 soldiers on guard at the British Fortan in Jalalabad saw a single horsemen riding toward them with all the speed that his main and worn out horse could muster it was the surgeon doctor Bryden the only man it seemed to survive the fearful journey from Kabul and the footnote here is that Bryden was the only European to arrive at Jalalabad but in the days after his arrival a few Indian soldiers and a number of followers also completed the journey elephant stone himself died of dysentery after being made captive of Akbar Khan we were laughing a couple minutes ago and I don't know I wish I could remember the word there's a word that described like when your reaction doesn't actually match what you're feeling and I forgot what that word is but it's it's the level of disbelief it made this reaction that I'm having adhering this when you're laughing at the description comes from like the level of tragedy this is this is a lot because I didn't read this you know I had actually I had this book
