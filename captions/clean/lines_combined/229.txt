00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.72 This is Jockel podcast number 229 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:16.16 echo. Good evening. Leadership means firmness, not harshness or bullying. Understanding,
00:00:16.16 --> 00:00:28.64 not weakness. Justice, not irresponsible freedom. Humanness, not intolerance. Generosity,
00:00:28.64 --> 00:00:40.88 not selfishness, pride, not ego-tism. So, little quote for you, kick things off. This is
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:47.84 coming. I ran across at the other day and as I ran across it, I saw some of a little bit of the
00:00:47.84 --> 00:00:54.64 dichotomy, a leadership in there and it just caught my attention and it's a quote from General Omar Bradley,
00:00:54.64 --> 00:01:05.04 a general with a good amount of name recognition. But a general who kind of flew under the radar
00:01:05.04 --> 00:01:12.16 sometimes because he was competing with some some big names. You know, he's competing with
00:01:12.88 --> 00:01:17.28 General Pat and he's competing with General Eisenhower, he's competing with General Mungumri. So,
00:01:17.28 --> 00:01:23.60 he kind of flew under the radar sometimes. You know, he does have the Bradley fighting vehicle
00:01:23.60 --> 00:01:31.92 named after him, which is a awesome machine. But he absolutely was a well regarded general in his own
00:01:31.92 --> 00:01:41.36 right born in 1893 in Randolph County, Missouri, worked as a boiler maker, figured out he could get
00:01:41.36 --> 00:01:45.60 a free education by going to West Point. So, he went to West Point, graduated in 1915,
00:01:46.72 --> 00:01:53.20 same year as Eisenhower, by the way. He was a really good athlete, baseball star, could have played
00:01:53.20 --> 00:02:01.12 pro ball, but chose to be in the army, chose to go and do his commitment to the army. So,
00:02:01.12 --> 00:02:10.32 1915, you're probably thinking World War I, WWE, I. Well, he actually didn't go to World War I.
00:02:10.32 --> 00:02:18.56 He didn't go and fight World War I. There were mining disputes in the unions in the minds
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:25.28 up in Montana, and they had to activate some army units to send him up there to guard the mines.
00:02:25.28 --> 00:02:29.92 And that's what he did. He did that for a little while. And then he did go to unit that was getting
00:02:29.92 --> 00:02:36.64 ready to deploy to World War I. The Spanish flu came, which everyone seems to know about the Spanish
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:42.72 flu now. And they would then know as the armistice, and he didn't deploy. So, he didn't get any combat
00:02:42.72 --> 00:02:49.20 action in World War I. Thought that that might hurt his career, but he stayed in anyways,
00:02:49.20 --> 00:02:54.24 ended up teaching tactics at the infantry school, fast forward through the the peace years,
00:02:55.28 --> 00:03:01.44 made general in 1942, assigned the 82nd division, then the 28th National Guard Division,
00:03:02.16 --> 00:03:08.40 eventually worked under General Patton as the deputy in charge of second corps, and then took
00:03:08.40 --> 00:03:16.72 it over himself, led the campaigns in Tunisia, and Sicily, Ike Eisenhower selected Bradley to
00:03:16.72 --> 00:03:24.80 command the first army during Operation Overlord D. Day. Command, he commanded the most troops of any
00:03:24.80 --> 00:03:30.80 general US general in history. When he took command of the 12th Army group, 1.3 million troops.
00:03:32.48 --> 00:03:37.52 Little decentralized command, better coming to play right there, continue with all those troops
00:03:37.52 --> 00:03:43.92 to push through Europe until the fall of Germany. We covered Ernie Pile on this podcast,
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:50.48 podcast number 39, his book Brave Men, it was the heaviest one of my favorite lines.
00:03:52.32 --> 00:03:58.16 Ernie Pile nicknamed him the GI general, because he was kind of a layback down to earth guy,
00:03:58.16 --> 00:04:05.76 didn't make a spectacle of himself. After the war, he ran the VA for a while, the veterans administration,
00:04:05.76 --> 00:04:13.52 first-ever chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Korean War. Retired in 1953,
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:20.88 after 38 years of service. I found that the internet is amazing. I found an evaluation.
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:28.000 You know, we talk about the evaluations, the evaluation, the Marine Corps evaluation,
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.60 the Navy evaluation. I found an evaluation of Bradley written by General Patton.
00:04:36.80 --> 00:04:43.92 Pretty cool, because it shows what type of a person Patton was just in the way he wrote this thing.
00:04:43.92 --> 00:04:52.64 So, it says subject efficiency report. Through commanding general, NATO USA APO 534 to
00:04:52.64 --> 00:05:00.40 an agedant general, war department, Washington, D.C. Name in grade of general officer reported on,
00:05:00.40 --> 00:05:06.88 Omar F. Bradley, Lieutenant General. Period covered, 1 July 1943 to 8 September 1943,
00:05:06.88 --> 00:05:13.44 2 months and 8 days. duties performed. Commanding general 2 core, 1 July 1943 to 8 September
00:05:14.40 --> 00:05:22.24 19 something unclear. Manor of performance, superior, physical activity,
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:28.80 superior, physical endurance, superior, knowledge of his profession, superior,
00:05:29.76 --> 00:05:35.60 for what command or duty would you specifically recommend him, and army.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.36 And then what opportunities have you had for observing him during period covered, intimate daily
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:51.36 contact? Does he render a willing and generous support to plans of superiors regardless of
00:05:51.36 --> 00:05:59.28 personal views in the matter? Yes, which is a very interesting topic to cover. You think about
00:05:59.28 --> 00:06:04.64 what they've got in there, physical duty, knowledge of his profession, what job would you recommend?
00:06:04.64 --> 00:06:10.96 And then does he give generous support to plans of superiors regardless of his personal views in the
00:06:10.96 --> 00:06:18.48 matter? So, this guy is going to back you up. The answer there is yes. And 10 of all general officers
00:06:18.48 --> 00:06:26.48 of his grade personally known to you, what number would you give him on this list? And how many
00:06:26.48 --> 00:06:36.72 comprise your list? And Patent's answer is number one, I know all of them. Further remarks deemed
00:06:36.72 --> 00:06:46.56 necessary? None. signed GS Patent Jr. Lieutenant General, U.S. Army Commanding. So, that's a pretty
00:06:46.56 --> 00:06:52.40 awesome review. The interesting thing is if you know anything about the history of Bradley and Patent,
00:06:52.40 --> 00:06:57.04 there's some interesting dynamics there. First of all, they had very different personalities.
00:06:58.40 --> 00:07:06.08 Patent was, you know, flashy and ego driven in a lot of ways and Bradley was not.
00:07:06.96 --> 00:07:12.56 And there's some quotes I pulled from Patent's journal, journals about Bradley.
00:07:12.56 --> 00:07:16.72 So, it's interesting that you can have these right in that glowing
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:23.76 like evaluation about him to try and get him promoted. But at the same time here's some things he said about him.
00:07:25.60 --> 00:07:30.000 Bradley is too conservative. He wants to wait until we can all jump into the fight together. By which
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.56 time, half our men will be, will have the flu or trench foot. I wish he had a little more daring.
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:39.12 Another one. Bradley is a good officer, but he utterly lacks it.
00:07:39.12 --> 00:07:49.60 It too bad. The it factor echo Charles. Next one, Bradley is a man of great mediocrity.
00:07:50.56 --> 00:07:57.12 On the other hand, he has many attributes which are considered desirable in a general. He wears glasses,
00:07:57.12 --> 00:08:02.72 which I have no idea. I have no idea why that's cool. To be a general. He wears glasses. He has a strong
00:08:02.72 --> 00:08:11.84 jaw. He talks profoundly and says little. And he is a shooting companion of our present chief of staff
00:08:11.84 --> 00:08:18.000 general Marshall. Also, he is a loyal man. I consider him to be among our better generals.
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:25.76 Another quote. We had a lot quite a long talk and I told Bradley a lot of my best ideas to tell
00:08:25.76 --> 00:08:30.40 general Marshall. I suppose I should have kept them to myself, but I am not built that way.
00:08:30.40 --> 00:08:35.92 The sooner they are put into effect, the better it will be for me. So there, here we see a little
00:08:37.04 --> 00:08:41.28 plant in the seed, you know, leading up the chain of command right there.
00:08:43.92 --> 00:08:50.72 And then he says, it was really a great plan, holy my own. And I made Bradley believe that he thought of it.
00:08:53.68 --> 00:08:57.76 That's exactly what I talk about. Look, plant the seed, let them think it's their own idea.
00:08:57.76 --> 00:09:03.36 But because it's patent because he got a little bit of that ego that kicks in.
00:09:04.72 --> 00:09:10.56 He also wrote this. I do not wish any more of my ideas to be used without credit to me,
00:09:11.36 --> 00:09:17.36 which is what happens when I give them orally to Bradley. How's that for sure, excited? That's
00:09:17.36 --> 00:09:24.24 saddery. Little bit saddery. Another one where ego gets the best of patent.
00:09:24.24 --> 00:09:29.76 He says, Courtney Hodges and Omar Bradley both received a distinct service metal for their
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:36.24 unsuccessful defense of the bulge. I did not receive one for successfully defending it. So
00:09:36.96 --> 00:09:47.60 clearly these guys had a, you know, an interesting relationship. General Bradley also wrote a book.
00:09:47.60 --> 00:09:55.28 And it's from what I gather his A. D. Camp did most of the writing, which I'm not saying that's a horrible
00:09:55.28 --> 00:10:01.44 thing because writing is a, is a mechanical thing that you have to do. And if you can get someone to catch your
00:10:01.44 --> 00:10:07.28 ideas and do it well, then it's fine. But the book was released in 1951. It's called a soldier story.
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:13.92 It's 600 page book. Details is experienced as the army had, obviously, especially in World War II.
00:10:13.92 --> 00:10:17.60 And I'm sure we're going to cover that book at some point we're not doing it today.
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:26.000 But you know, when I, after I read that quote about him and you know, just talking about leadership
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.48 and kind of the dichotomies that are there, I remember this short piece that I haven't. I got
00:10:30.48 --> 00:10:36.32 a bunch of these little short things and a certain file folder in my computer. And they're old too.
00:10:36.32 --> 00:10:41.12 I've been collecting them for a long time. What's the name of the file? It's a books and PDFs.
00:10:41.12 --> 00:10:46.72 I have this thing, books and PDFs that I just download. I save them in a books and PDFs. I got
00:10:46.72 --> 00:10:54.56 a lot of them. We've covered a bunch of them too on this podcast. So I remembered this one of
00:10:54.56 --> 00:11:04.32 his and it is called leadership. General of the army, Omar and Bradley, the articles first published
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:10.56 in a winter 1972 issue of parameters, which is the magazine of the US Army War College.
00:11:12.56 --> 00:11:17.84 Editors know, General to the Army, Omar and Bradley visited Carlisle Barracks on seven to eight
00:11:17.84 --> 00:11:23.52 October 1971 to meet with members of the 12th Army Group Association. While he was at Carlisle,
00:11:23.52 --> 00:11:26.80 he addressed the Army War College faculty and students on the subject of leadership.
00:11:26.80 --> 00:11:31.12 His address contained observations that were gleaned during a long and significant career.
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:36.24 A careful reading of his remarks, give us some insight into the qualities that made
00:11:36.24 --> 00:11:41.76 General Bradley the great soldier and human being that he is. General Bradley's thesis is that leadership
00:11:41.76 --> 00:11:47.44 is an intangible that involves a constant interplay between the leader and the lead.
00:11:48.16 --> 00:11:53.44 When this interplay is successful, we have the ingredients for great accomplishment.
00:11:53.44 --> 00:12:01.68 So, there you go. Kicking into it. All of you here this evening are leaders. I am pleased to
00:12:01.68 --> 00:12:09.76 meet you. What you do may well dignify the past explained today and secure for all of us tomorrow.
00:12:11.12 --> 00:12:15.76 Perhaps I can touch upon a few factors that will underscore the value of good leadership.
00:12:15.76 --> 00:12:23.76 Leadership is an intangible. No weapon, no impersonal piece of machinery,
00:12:23.76 --> 00:12:30.72 ever designed can take its place. It's an interesting idea that leadership is intangible.
00:12:31.84 --> 00:12:37.68 Have you ever heard that expression? That somebody asked for the definition of pornography
00:12:38.24 --> 00:12:42.96 and the Supreme Court Court just said, I can't give you a definition, but I know it when I see
00:12:42.96 --> 00:12:49.20 it. It's a weird thing, because leadership, if you're going to define it specifically,
00:12:49.76 --> 00:12:55.28 it's kind of the same answer. Look, I can't tell you exactly what it is, but I know it when I see it.
00:12:55.28 --> 00:13:00.72 And you see different people do it differently. Yeah. And you can see two different people say
00:13:00.72 --> 00:13:05.76 or do the same thing, but it'd be like, hey, this guy's leading in this guy's sort of not.
00:13:05.76 --> 00:13:12.72 You know, he's doing something else. Yeah. There's, in leadership strategy and tactics. I
00:13:12.72 --> 00:13:20.16 give someone talking about pride and the same sentence about pride, depending on who is saying it,
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:28.16 and what context it is can be negative or positive. Yeah. For instance, that guy's full of pride,
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:32.56 right? Yeah. Or that guy's full of pride. You know what I mean? Like that's the same sentence.
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:39.36 But it needs to completely different things. Yeah. So continuing on,
00:13:39.36 --> 00:13:47.36 this is the age of the computer, by the way, this is 1971. And if you know how to program the
00:13:47.36 --> 00:13:54.24 machine, you can get quick and accurate answers, but how can you include leadership and morale,
00:13:54.24 --> 00:14:00.96 which is affected by leadership into your programming? Let us never forget the great importance of
00:14:00.96 --> 00:14:07.44 this element, leadership, and while we use computers for certain answers, let us not try to fight a
00:14:07.44 --> 00:14:14.72 whole war or even a single battle without giving proper consideration to the element of leadership.
00:14:15.84 --> 00:14:19.44 Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. You're a little calculator over there.
00:14:21.84 --> 00:14:28.16 We're going to be covering a podcast shortly about the creation of Top Gun
00:14:29.76 --> 00:14:36.40 and same thing. There's some people that would do the calculations of this, this aircraft versus
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:42.40 that aircraft. And think, well, this aircraft, this is period aircraft, it will win. How many times
00:14:43.12 --> 00:14:48.80 is that wrong? What are they not calculated? They're not calculating the human element. How many times
00:14:48.80 --> 00:14:55.04 have you watched a UFC fight? We're on paper. Everyone thought, person A was going to win,
00:14:55.04 --> 00:15:01.76 and person B wins, because the human element, they don't calculate it. So how can we expect to
00:15:01.76 --> 00:15:06.40 calculate what's going to happen in combat without trying to figure out what implication leadership
00:15:06.40 --> 00:15:16.48 has on it? Continuing on, another element to be considered is the man to be led and with
00:15:16.48 --> 00:15:22.24 who's morale we are concerned. I'm constantly reminded of this point by a cartoon which hangs over
00:15:22.24 --> 00:15:27.20 my desk at home, which depicts an infantryman with his rifle across his knees as he sits behind
00:15:27.20 --> 00:15:35.36 a parapet. Above him is the list of the newest weapons science has devised. The newest weapons
00:15:35.36 --> 00:15:40.40 science has devised and the soldier behind the parapet is saying, but they still haven't found
00:15:40.40 --> 00:15:49.36 out the substitute for me. So there's a human being. Of course, with this particular group of
00:15:49.36 --> 00:15:55.52 service personnel, I'm considering leadership as it applies to a military unit. However,
00:15:55.52 --> 00:16:00.24 having been associated with industry for some time now, I find it difficult to completely
00:16:00.24 --> 00:16:05.44 separate the principles of military and industrial leadership. They have much in common.
00:16:05.44 --> 00:16:11.76 Yeah, and he retired in 1953 this 1971. He worked with some companies. I know he was the
00:16:11.76 --> 00:16:17.60 like the chairman of Blova. Blova, how do you say it? Blova, watch company, BUL, OVA.
00:16:17.60 --> 00:16:23.60 Yeah, Blova. Yeah, Blova, blah, blah, blah. He was using the chairman of that. So that's a big company.
00:16:23.60 --> 00:16:32.32 So he understood the same thing that we now know to be true. And that's a strong statement that I
00:16:32.32 --> 00:16:38.32 say it. Yes, I did. We know to be true. I couldn't have told you this 10 years. The day I retired
00:16:38.32 --> 00:16:42.88 from the Navy, I couldn't have told you that military and civilian leadership in the same. I couldn't
00:16:42.88 --> 00:16:46.80 have answered that question. I didn't know it. I didn't know the answer. It wasn't until I
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:52.08 started working with civilian companies that I said, oh, these are the same. The same principles
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:57.12 employed in both situations. And that's what Omar Bradley is saying here. He says they have
00:16:57.12 --> 00:17:06.48 much in common. They have more than much. They have a lot in common. I'd go so far as to say they have
00:17:06.48 --> 00:17:10.40 everything in common. But there's differences. But I'll tell you, the differences between
00:17:12.32 --> 00:17:17.84 leading an army of platoon, leading a Marine Corp. Those there's little differences there.
00:17:17.84 --> 00:17:26.96 Are the same differences between leading a gas station and a construction site? There's, so
00:17:26.96 --> 00:17:31.76 going from one construction site to another, there's little differences. I used to say that about
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:36.40 seal platoons. Because like the difference between a seal platoon and another seal platoon are the
00:17:36.40 --> 00:17:41.12 same differences that you find. There's just going to be differences in those situations. The principles
00:17:41.12 --> 00:17:45.04 don't change. The principles don't change leading a construction site. The principles don't change
00:17:45.04 --> 00:17:52.24 leading a manufacturing line. The principles don't change leading a Girl Scout troop. Leadership is
00:17:52.24 --> 00:17:57.36 leadership. Moving on, in selecting a company in which to invest our savings, we often
00:17:58.56 --> 00:18:04.72 give primary consideration to the company with good leadership. In similar manner, a military unit is
00:18:04.72 --> 00:18:12.08 often judged by its leadership. Good leadership is essential to organize action where any group is
00:18:12.08 --> 00:18:18.56 involved. Now, if you were to dig down into this right here, I'm here to tell you, if you're going
00:18:18.56 --> 00:18:25.36 to invest in a company, the number one thing you should look at is what's the leadership like,
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:31.28 because if they have a great product, groundbreaking product, but they have horrible leadership,
00:18:31.28 --> 00:18:36.88 it doesn't matter. Leadership should be the number one you component you look at. When we work with
00:18:36.88 --> 00:18:43.76 big investment groups, sometimes they're wanting us just to tell them, doing assessment, making
00:18:43.76 --> 00:18:51.04 assessment, what is this leadership pod like one of these humans like? Are they good leaders?
00:18:51.04 --> 00:18:55.44 Do they have capabilities? Do they have potential? Are they bad? Those are the questions.
00:18:58.24 --> 00:19:04.16 Continue on the one who commands, be he a military officer or captain of industry, must project
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:09.12 power, an energizing power which coordinates and marshals the best efforts of his followers
00:19:09.12 --> 00:19:14.48 by supplying that certain something for which they look to him, be it guidance, support,
00:19:14.48 --> 00:19:18.48 encouragement, example, or even new ideas and imagination.
00:19:22.16 --> 00:19:27.44 Projecting power. That's an interesting concept. And look, I'd love to tell you, well, you know,
00:19:27.44 --> 00:19:31.28 let's know you didn't need to project but if you dig a little bit deeper on that statement,
00:19:31.28 --> 00:19:38.56 it's fairly accurate. Projection of power. Yeah. A peer powerful. Just saying, hey, I got this.
00:19:38.56 --> 00:19:44.24 We can do this. You know what I mean? I guess it's a form of confidence. Yeah. Which he talks
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:54.08 about later, but I think that that projection of power and energizing power. That's what he's talking
00:19:54.08 --> 00:19:58.56 about, which coordinates and marshals the best efforts. You've seen this before, right? Let's just
00:19:58.56 --> 00:20:05.52 look into a kind of a generic situation. You see a group. They're not really focused. They're
00:20:05.52 --> 00:20:09.92 not really making anything happen. And all of a sudden, the leader steps up takes control,
00:20:11.12 --> 00:20:15.36 exhibits that power and they and marshals those people to move the same direction. That's
00:20:15.36 --> 00:20:19.92 what leadership is. You're watching American beauty. You're watching that movie. I have seen it,
00:20:19.92 --> 00:20:25.20 but I don't really remember. It's actually pretty good. But there's a part this guy, his name,
00:20:25.20 --> 00:20:31.60 was named, but he called himself the king of real estate. He's kind of an all one off character.
00:20:32.64 --> 00:20:39.60 And he said to the lady, I forget her name, something burn him. Anyway, it says to the lady,
00:20:40.72 --> 00:20:48.32 call me crazy, but it's my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image
00:20:48.32 --> 00:20:57.92 of success at all times. Interesting. Super cheesy. And let's think about that, right? If you project
00:20:57.92 --> 00:21:02.96 an image of success all at all time, when are you projecting your vulnerability? When are you
00:21:02.96 --> 00:21:10.08 projecting your humility? If you're just walking around by the the the the the the murk.
00:21:10.08 --> 00:21:22.40 Right and you're rolling with the Rolex Mercedes. Okay, I understand. Rolling with the
00:21:22.40 --> 00:21:30.80 murk and the Rolex. The Rolex. The Rolex. Yeah, but I don't I don't I don't necessarily.
00:21:30.80 --> 00:21:34.000 I don't remember. I don't remember. When I heard that, I was like, probably you're just a
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.32 composer. That's what all you do is it was like basically it was because like he just broke up with his girl. And then the lady was like,
00:21:40.32 --> 00:21:45.52 oh, I thought you guys were doing so well or whatever. And then he's like, it was alive. You're essentially
00:21:45.52 --> 00:21:50.72 yeah, it was like basically I put on an image of success to be successful in my business. I don't know,
00:21:50.72 --> 00:21:58.72 whatever. I got a better idea. If you want to be successful, why don't you be humble? Why don't you step
00:21:58.72 --> 00:22:04.56 up in work hard? There's a bunch of other better ways to be successful than pretending to be successful.
00:22:04.56 --> 00:22:15.92 I'm a throw that out there right now. I don't agree. Continuing on. The test of a leader lies in
00:22:15.92 --> 00:22:25.68 the reaction and response of his followers. That's straightforward. The reaction response. Look,
00:22:25.68 --> 00:22:33.28 if you're a leader and people don't react correctly, you're failing. He should not have to impose authority.
00:22:34.96 --> 00:22:43.36 Say it again. He should not have to impose authority. Bossingus in itself never made a leader.
00:22:44.96 --> 00:22:50.48 He must make his influence felt by example and the instilling of confidence in his followers.
00:22:50.48 --> 00:22:57.84 The greatness of a leader is measured by the achievements of the lead. This is the ultimate test of his effectiveness.
00:22:59.28 --> 00:23:05.52 You know, I think he brushes up against a lot of stuff. And this is like my third time reading through this
00:23:05.52 --> 00:23:12.56 today. And I keep I keep seeing little connections, right? I keep seeing little where he's brushing
00:23:12.56 --> 00:23:21.36 up against really important things and talking about him, talking about him, kind of passes through
00:23:21.36 --> 00:23:26.32 him, like mentions them. And some of them are perfect. He should not have to even impose authority.
00:23:26.32 --> 00:23:33.52 That's obvious. It's almost like he's uncomfortable saying it because he continues on by
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:36.56 his hand he must make his influence felt by the example and instilling of confidence. So,
00:23:36.56 --> 00:23:39.76 see the thing that I have a prompt while I guess I don't know. Maybe you can help me.
00:23:39.76 --> 00:23:47.28 And still in confidence, what does that mean? There's a little bit of a lack of explanation behind that.
00:23:48.16 --> 00:23:53.36 We know what it means. Maybe this is why he says leadership is intangible. Because look,
00:23:54.80 --> 00:23:58.48 we say, hey, you want to instill confidence in your people. Great. Thank you.
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:05.60 That's that goes without saying how do we actually do it? How do we actually do it? How do you
00:24:05.60 --> 00:24:10.48 and so confidence in people? Oh, how about you give them something that they can handle? Okay,
00:24:10.48 --> 00:24:16.16 that's a good thing. How about we take our team and we go out and we accomplish a pretty simple
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:20.16 straightforward objective and our confidence goes up a little bit and then we handle more complicated
00:24:20.16 --> 00:24:24.16 one. We keep doing that and then we give subordinate leaders things. You see what I'm saying?
00:24:24.16 --> 00:24:29.76 This idea of just making people confident, instilling confidence in your followers,
00:24:29.76 --> 00:24:36.80 great. How do I do it? And by the way, that's leadership strategy in tactics. That is why I wrote
00:24:36.80 --> 00:24:43.76 leadership strategy in tactics. Because those questions right there, I realized there was a gap between,
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:52.24 hey, build a relationship with your boss. That's great, Jocco. How do I do it? How am I supposed to
00:24:52.24 --> 00:24:58.96 do that? I was on EF online the other day and I said, I said, Jamie, because I was talking through
00:24:58.96 --> 00:25:04.40 someone, I said, I got the name, I got my next book and she was like, oh, great, because she's always
00:25:04.40 --> 00:25:09.04 mad because I'm doing too much. Yes. And I said, because we were talking to somebody about Ego,
00:25:09.04 --> 00:25:12.96 I put, oh yeah, I would give that personal Ego massage maneuver around plant the seeds, all this.
00:25:12.96 --> 00:25:20.24 And I said, my next book is going to be called, what was it? Ancient techniques of Ego massage therapy.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.92 Right? Because you could actually do that. You could say, hey, here's the person that you're
00:25:25.92 --> 00:25:29.44 dealing with. Here's how you want to massage that Ego. Here's another person. Here's another ancient
00:25:29.44 --> 00:25:35.36 technique of Ego massage. Yeah, that'd be actually really good. I know. No, I'm not even kidding.
00:25:35.36 --> 00:25:39.52 Because you know, you could tell someone, even now, like if they don't have the guidelines like a
00:25:39.52 --> 00:25:45.36 for real comprehensive, you know, instructional, they're going, it's so easy to take that kind of
00:25:45.36 --> 00:25:49.12 too far. You know, like, oh, just massage is Ego. Yeah, you go massage Ego do too much and
00:25:49.12 --> 00:25:52.48 the guy's like, probably this guy's kissing my ass right now or just trying to massage my Ego.
00:25:52.48 --> 00:25:57.60 Because this kind of part of Ego massage, effective Ego massage, they're not really
00:25:57.60 --> 00:26:03.44 knowing like that you're doing it for the sake of you. For sure. Yeah. For sure. If they know you're
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:09.92 doing it, that's a really work as a sketch. Yeah. All right. Cool. I'm waiting for that book too. Yeah.
00:26:11.12 --> 00:26:16.32 Yeah. So I'll get, I'll get working on it. Get cracking. Maybe we'll just be a little,
00:26:16.88 --> 00:26:22.08 maybe just be a little short, little handbook, cup techniques for the troops out there.
00:26:22.08 --> 00:26:26.16 You know what I'll think of? I'll think of other ancient techniques that need explanations
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:32.32 and I'll put them all in, let's say there's four sections. What do you mean ancient techniques?
00:26:32.32 --> 00:26:38.40 I'm just saying that. That's cool. Yeah, sounds cool. Yes, sir. Yeah. I probably could write a little
00:26:38.40 --> 00:26:45.04 book on that just by watching you do certain stuff. Well, you know what you can do to help me is you
00:26:45.04 --> 00:26:49.68 go, I saw you do this and then I can go into that exactly what I was doing and that would be helpful.
00:26:49.68 --> 00:26:53.76 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Because you get to see what's interesting for you is you see
00:26:53.76 --> 00:26:59.52 maneuvering happening on multiple different fronts. Yes. And I sit here and tell you hey, this is
00:26:59.52 --> 00:27:03.44 what's happening over here with this company. This is what the move is going to be. Watch out
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:08.40 it unfolds and you're like, okay, and then you watch and you go, okay? Makes sense. Yes. Yes.
00:27:08.40 --> 00:27:18.32 All right. Continue moving on. Two frequently we use the words leader and commander
00:27:18.32 --> 00:27:24.08 synonymously. We should not forget that there are far more staff officers, staff officer
00:27:24.08 --> 00:27:29.68 assignments and there are command billets and a good staff officer can and should display the same
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:35.52 leadership as a commander. While it takes a good staff officer to initiate an effective plan,
00:27:35.52 --> 00:27:43.84 it requires a leader to ensure that the plan is properly executed. This is good stuff that we're
00:27:43.84 --> 00:27:50.56 about to dive into. That is why you and I have been taught that the work of collecting information
00:27:50.56 --> 00:27:56.72 studying at drawing a plan and making a decision is 10% of the job. Seeing the plan through is the
00:27:56.72 --> 00:28:02.08 other 90% a well-trained officer is one who can serve effectively either as a staff officer or
00:28:02.08 --> 00:28:05.36 as a commander. So by a staff officer they mean the guy that's coming up and helping coming up
00:28:05.36 --> 00:28:11.04 and putting together the plan and going through logistics of it all. That's the staff officer and
00:28:11.04 --> 00:28:17.04 then there's the person that makes it happen. That executes it. That's the commander. It's interesting
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:22.80 to think. This goes back to what we were talking about on the last podcast where I was saying,
00:28:22.80 --> 00:28:28.32 look, you're your commander and your troops, right? You're both of those things. So you can come
00:28:28.32 --> 00:28:36.80 up with great ideas in your little head. Beautiful plans. Amazing plans. Can you imagine how many
00:28:36.80 --> 00:28:44.08 people come up with plans that are actually freaking awesome but they never execute them?
00:28:45.28 --> 00:28:52.96 Think about that. That is a graveyard. A massive, infinite graveyard of incredibly good plans that
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:57.68 never got executed on. The staff guy in their head, there's a nut see this is where the metaphor
00:28:57.68 --> 00:29:01.92 continues because you got a staff guy in your head that said, come on up with these little plans.
00:29:01.92 --> 00:29:06.96 Right? Coming up with these great plans. Hey if I start this work out. Hey if I start this business,
00:29:06.96 --> 00:29:11.60 hey if I can produce this thing, they come up with these staff officer coming up with great plans.
00:29:11.60 --> 00:29:18.56 Super. Good job. Unless that commander can get the troops in your head to execute it as no value
00:29:18.56 --> 00:29:25.92 whatsoever. And by the way, and we've talked about this, that idea by itself is zero value.
00:29:25.92 --> 00:29:32.40 Yeah. This is your old value. You come up with this great idea. Hey, Jocquai, thought of this new app.
00:29:33.84 --> 00:29:38.40 Right? Because everyone thinks of a new app every day. Hey, Jocquai, thought of this new app.
00:29:38.40 --> 00:29:45.28 It's game changer. Okay. Cool. Get it. How many of those things get executed?
00:29:45.28 --> 00:29:51.36 Yeah. Not many. So let me ask you this. Mr. opinion on this. So let's say
00:29:51.36 --> 00:29:58.80 me and another person. Right. Good. So okay. Let's say somebody says, hey, I have this great idea
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:04.96 and tells you. You know, and it's an, and I, it's a good idea actually. And it says,
00:30:04.96 --> 00:30:09.44 this is how I'm going to execute, you know, whatever. Actually, there's so many different scenarios.
00:30:09.44 --> 00:30:15.60 But okay, this one. Okay. Here's my plan. And it's a, I'm starting to worry about the execution of
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:23.28 this very idea. So we watch this unfold. Let's see what's happening. Okay. And then I don't have
00:30:23.28 --> 00:30:27.92 the capability to execute this plan at all. You know, there are other people who do, but it's just my
00:30:27.92 --> 00:30:33.20 idea. It's my idea. I don't know. I've got pill vacures, cancer, I don't know anything. But let's say,
00:30:33.20 --> 00:30:39.60 I have that idea to tell you. And then you're like, oh, yeah, good idea. And then years go by
00:30:39.60 --> 00:30:44.40 and I never execute. I never call somebody up to help execute it. You know, I'm just done.
00:30:44.40 --> 00:30:49.44 That was just my idea that I intended it. He went into the graveyard. Then he said, and then
00:30:51.28 --> 00:30:59.20 you say, then is a good idea. I unlike you have the capability to actually execute most of this.
00:30:59.20 --> 00:31:03.92 And I know the other guy who can execute the rest. Meanwhile, me, I don't, I don't have any
00:31:03.92 --> 00:31:07.76 capability. And I don't know anyone. I'd have to go shopping for my N.A. simply didn't do it.
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:11.76 Right. Let's say you say, okay, and you execute the plan and be successful in your new thing.
00:31:11.76 --> 00:31:18.32 Mm-hmm. Right. Is that like a violation or how do you feel about that? Because you know that happens a lot.
00:31:18.32 --> 00:31:22.72 Right. Yeah, it definitely happens a lot. And it paints the reality. And what's interesting,
00:31:22.72 --> 00:31:27.60 you've heard the term idea guy? Oh, yes. Like, oh, that person's a good idea guy.
00:31:27.60 --> 00:31:31.92 Want to head. But it's kind of, it's kind of a pejorative, right? Oh, that guy? Well,
00:31:32.56 --> 00:31:36.80 that guy's an idea guy. Meaning like, hey, that guy can't really make anything happening.
00:31:36.80 --> 00:31:40.48 Good. You can sit around here and spout off good ideas. That's great. So funny.
00:31:40.48 --> 00:31:44.32 That's great. But you don't actually execute on any of them. Yeah. Which is just,
00:31:45.52 --> 00:31:51.76 what do I think should happen? Quite honestly, I guess in a perfect world, that person that came
00:31:51.76 --> 00:31:56.40 up with the idea and didn't execute it, he's paying the price for not making it happen. And the price
00:31:56.40 --> 00:32:03.12 is you watch somebody else, you know, go and and do well with your idea because you didn't execute.
00:32:03.12 --> 00:32:07.68 Right. So he's going to think, let's, let's say the, let's say I'm the idea guy in this
00:32:07.68 --> 00:32:10.88 particular scenario and you're the, you're the guy who can actually make it happen. Right.
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:17.60 Usually the idea guy is going to be kind of salty because he's like, hey, I told you that the whole idea,
00:32:17.60 --> 00:32:23.92 you know, not how to do it, but just the idea like that was my idea, you know, like on
00:32:23.92 --> 00:32:28.48 sign field, it was my idea for the colon that smells like the beach anyway. Okay. It's a thing. But
00:32:29.28 --> 00:32:35.92 usually that's why that guy's salty, right? Yeah, he's mad. Yeah, he's mad. But the reality is,
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:41.52 like, Brad not only did you not execute, like, I don't even know if you could. Really. Yeah,
00:32:41.52 --> 00:32:46.40 there's a weird thing there because if you don't have, you said two things. You don't have to
00:32:46.40 --> 00:32:50.72 keep the ability of executing, which is a little bit different than don't have not having the
00:32:50.72 --> 00:32:57.52 will to execute. Yeah. So this, what I meant was, you don't like, okay, so I get this, this whole scenario
00:32:57.52 --> 00:33:01.84 is actually like a real scenario that happens all the time. Back when I used to make websites,
00:33:01.84 --> 00:33:06.48 like, I'd hear it all the time or at my brother, J, he makes apps. So when you say,
00:33:06.48 --> 00:33:09.68 you're going to go to school, I'd different, you know, oh, that's a real thing. And everybody's calling
00:33:10.40 --> 00:33:14.32 him, like, I got this idea for this app, right? Meanwhile, they know nothing about what they're doing
00:33:14.32 --> 00:33:19.20 at all. Like they're like, oh, this is, it wouldn't be cool to have an app that can read people's minds.
00:33:19.20 --> 00:33:24.48 Or that's not a real one, but I'm just saying, meanwhile, they have no idea about making apps
00:33:24.48 --> 00:33:28.88 first off. They have no idea about mind reading, second off. And they have no idea about, like,
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:32.48 anything else, you know, they're like, but they're like, that's a cool idea. Let me call the app
00:33:32.48 --> 00:33:36.72 that, you know, and then so most of the time it's like, even if that were a good idea, which it's not,
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:43.28 but even if it was, I don't need you for that to do it. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, and there's a
00:33:43.28 --> 00:33:48.48 weird thing there because there's also people that don't have any good ideas, but that are
00:33:48.48 --> 00:33:55.52 really good at execution. Yeah. So what I recommend you do is you form up your team where you have
00:33:55.52 --> 00:34:01.52 people that have ideas and people that can execute those ideas. Yeah. So you compliment each other.
00:34:01.52 --> 00:34:06.000 You work with someone that can actually make things happen. I couldn't make this podcast.
00:34:06.64 --> 00:34:11.76 I didn't know how to press record. You know, I didn't know how to. I didn't know what piece of
00:34:11.76 --> 00:34:17.76 equipment we're going to need. I couldn't execute it. I have an idea. Hey, I think we should do
00:34:17.76 --> 00:34:22.72 bad. That's the exact same thing you're talking about right now. Now, I could have sat in my closet
00:34:22.72 --> 00:34:28.64 by myself going, I had going to do a cool podcast about war and human nature and it would be so good.
00:34:29.76 --> 00:34:34.000 I could sat there for five years with this idea and someone else would come out. Maybe I
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.68 would have told somebody and they would be like, I'm going to execute on that. What did I do?
00:34:37.68 --> 00:34:42.32 I actually said, oh, I don't have the capability to execute this by myself. Fine.
00:34:42.32 --> 00:34:47.84 Echo Charles, do you know how to make a podcast? Yes, I can figure it out. Cool. We're making a podcast.
00:34:47.84 --> 00:34:50.96 That's an example. Right? I can't execute it by myself.
00:34:50.96 --> 00:34:55.68 And it doesn't matter to me. I'm not caught up on the fact that because there's people that sit
00:34:55.68 --> 00:35:03.44 on ideas, they won't tell me, they're not selling this NDA. Right? I've signed so many NDAs
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:08.40 for people to tell me they're brilliant ideas and I go stealing. Yes, I won't steal it.
00:35:09.12 --> 00:35:16.16 And it's like, okay, cool. Very few of them. I feel bad. People are listening to this
00:35:16.16 --> 00:35:22.000 story. You said an NDA. There's some good ideas out there. Right? But a lot of them are number one,
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.84 the real obvious, you know, I've had people hit me well again. Hey, man, I'm already doing that or
00:35:27.84 --> 00:35:35.36 hey, that's in the works or whatever because it's just sorry. Oh, you know, but that's a classic example.
00:35:35.36 --> 00:35:38.96 Look, I know I can't execute. I'm not going to sit. You don't long as sat on the idea of having
00:35:38.96 --> 00:35:43.92 a podcast not very long. I want to have one who can help me execute this Echo Charles. Boom.
00:35:43.92 --> 00:35:51.76 Yeah. Yeah. Man, I always, I kind of feel it's weird because when you think about it, let's say,
00:35:52.80 --> 00:35:58.40 I don't know, you're a lot more mature than most of us. I do them 48 years old. I'm not saying
00:35:58.40 --> 00:36:04.16 I'm saying you're at it too. I'm saying you're at it too. Not your physical being, uh,
00:36:04.16 --> 00:36:08.80 you know how you're saying, even at 48 years old, you don't think of like, oh, this guy's mature.
00:36:08.80 --> 00:36:14.96 He actually just, oh, you know what I mean? You say someone that's a 20 one. You go all these pretty or
00:36:14.96 --> 00:36:19.28 actually like 17, you know, he's pretty mature kid, right? Oh, okay. I know, and so
00:36:19.28 --> 00:36:24.16 but the reason I'm saying is you understand because this, this immaturity versus maturity applies to
00:36:24.16 --> 00:36:30.000 it no matter what age. So let's say, all right, I'm going to use me. I'm not saying I'm like this. I'm not saying
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.20 I'm not like this, but I'm going to use me as the example. Yeah, so I'm like, let's say that I'm like, hey,
00:36:35.20 --> 00:36:40.80 you know, I'd be a great idea. Just impassing to like, I don't know, my friend or whatever. Let's say he's a
00:36:40.80 --> 00:36:45.92 surfer or surfer or surfer or cheaper or something and maybe an engineer too, you know, and
00:36:45.92 --> 00:36:50.32 I'm like, oh, you need to be a great idea for a surfer or the little motor on there. So I don't know
00:36:50.32 --> 00:36:57.44 whatever. We'll just say a motor on there. That does this and that. You know, like just impassing,
00:36:57.44 --> 00:37:03.68 right, that's my cool idea. First off, not only do I not know anything about surfer board making,
00:37:03.68 --> 00:37:08.08 it's like, I didn't really even mean like you should really do that and let's go into business. I didn't
00:37:08.08 --> 00:37:13.36 mean anything like tie to set it. Meanwhile, it's stuck in the guy's head where he's like, yeah, I could
00:37:13.36 --> 00:37:20.48 totally do that and no one's doing that and he does it becomes massively successful, right? Most of us
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:28.40 will have at least 1% of our little brain saying like, oh man, like, that's my idea. Like, I
00:37:28.40 --> 00:37:34.40 deserve part of it and you know what? If you, if I was the surfered, shaper, mechanical engineer guy
00:37:34.40 --> 00:37:40.08 and you gave me that idea and I was successful, I would give you reward. I would take care of you.
00:37:40.08 --> 00:37:44.40 I feel like cool. I think that's, I think that's the right thing to do actually. Yeah, I think
00:37:44.40 --> 00:37:51.28 something special. But, it would probably be out a different proportion than you think, because people
00:37:51.28 --> 00:37:55.12 with ideas always think that they think that they, they think that the idea is the hard part. Yeah,
00:37:55.12 --> 00:37:59.52 that's the everything, the idea without an idea, there's nothing, right? Right, without an idea, there's
00:37:59.52 --> 00:38:07.76 nothing. However, they're both equally important. But the idea usually gets less in the investment world,
00:38:07.76 --> 00:38:12.80 your good idea gets you like 10%. It doesn't get you 90%. A lot of people think that the idea should
00:38:12.80 --> 00:38:20.40 get them 90%. It doesn't get you 90%. It gets you 10%. It gets you 15%. Yeah, and under certain circumstances,
00:38:20.40 --> 00:38:26.24 yeah, of course. Mainly, I'm thrown out there as kind of a generality. I agree with you even 110%.
00:38:26.24 --> 00:38:32.40 You think I could agree with you 110%. Apparently, I think the idea part of it is worth less.
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:37.20 All right, because everyone, it's like, okay, okay, here's my idea. I'm saying it publicly. Straight up.
00:38:38.56 --> 00:38:43.04 Here's my idea. A pill that cures cancer. Just cures it.
00:38:44.80 --> 00:38:49.76 Just saying. That's a good idea, right? See, I'll kind of blame that that is,
00:38:49.76 --> 00:38:56.40 like, okay, so now one freaking, look, and not only did a million training people already have that idea,
00:38:56.40 --> 00:39:02.000 as far as an idea goes, like, I have no capability of executing this. Maybe I could get, like,
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.36 yeah, I think that's kind of a bad example. Well, it's an extreme thing that better one. No,
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:11.04 it's an extreme example. It's so extreme that it doesn't make, it doesn't make the point.
00:39:11.92 --> 00:39:18.000 You didn't think of something a little bit better. Well, all these app ideas are like kind of like that.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.80 It's like, you don't even, most of us don't know even how apps work. As far as making them.
00:39:23.52 --> 00:39:30.48 Yeah, you know what else is interesting is a lot of times the first company that has an idea and
00:39:30.48 --> 00:39:35.12 investment and pushes it. A lot of times they aren't the ones that are actually successful with that, with that idea.
00:39:36.16 --> 00:39:43.36 It takes another someone to take it to the next level. The MP3 players
00:39:43.36 --> 00:39:49.76 Apple didn't invent those. There was other companies that made MP3 players and then Apple came and
00:39:49.76 --> 00:39:55.12 made it into the iPod and it was super successful. So there's a lot of times where the idea
00:39:55.92 --> 00:39:59.84 phase just to get that thing launched and then someone else looks over and goes, yeah, that's a pretty good
00:39:59.84 --> 00:40:06.72 idea or jumping on it or jumping in the game. Yeah, and that kind of goes back to it in a way. So,
00:40:06.72 --> 00:40:11.36 you know how back to what you said where it's like, okay, if you got an idea from somebody and then
00:40:11.36 --> 00:40:16.64 you actually executed the idea and made successful when they had no capability or intention by the way.
00:40:17.52 --> 00:40:24.96 And you became massively successful when you'd pay them or whatever. I would be cool. But what if you
00:40:24.96 --> 00:40:29.20 didn't know the person? What if you heard the idea on like you're watching, I don't know,
00:40:29.20 --> 00:40:34.40 project or unwares something and you heard like one of the people say an idea just in passing to their
00:40:34.40 --> 00:40:38.80 friend on the show. You don't know them or nothing. I don't know. If you contact them and be like,
00:40:38.80 --> 00:40:44.16 hey, friends in hell, successful. I was a massive, massive, you'd one billion dollars. Yeah, I'd
00:40:44.16 --> 00:40:48.08 try and contact that person and be like, hey, I got this idea from you. Yeah, I don't think I would.
00:40:48.96 --> 00:40:54.40 Yeah, I think I would. I'm pretty, that's what I'm saying about that maturity, but I'm very mature.
00:40:54.40 --> 00:40:59.76 You're very mature person. Trying to take care of people if you know if they deserve it.
00:40:59.76 --> 00:41:04.88 And if you come up with a great idea, even though you did nothing to execute it, what if the idea is bothering me?
00:41:04.88 --> 00:41:10.96 Oh, yeah, sure. Especially when they do all the time. What if someone had the idea and
00:41:10.96 --> 00:41:15.60 forgive me for stringing this out? But I'm trying to see, I'm trying to identify your threshold.
00:41:15.60 --> 00:41:20.88 You seem to see. What if the idea was said by someone that you don't know
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.24 in passing and it was a joke? It wasn't even like a for idea. Like it was a joke. Like you're like,
00:41:28.24 --> 00:41:35.84 oh, we should invent a parachute that can spring a motor and take you, I don't know,
00:41:35.84 --> 00:41:39.36 something kind of ridiculous. But when you thought about your like, wait, wait, wait, wait,
00:41:39.36 --> 00:41:43.52 that's not where you did. I could actually do that. You did it. You know, they're totally joking.
00:41:43.52 --> 00:41:47.52 In fact, they were kind of mocking it. Then would you reward him? You got that idea from that?
00:41:47.52 --> 00:41:52.40 I don't know. I'd have the more specifics on the scenario. All right. But if people hit me with
00:41:52.40 --> 00:41:59.84 good ideas, I will take care of them. You know, pretty straightforward. All right. Go on back to
00:41:59.84 --> 00:42:09.68 the book. That's a rough. I can recall a former vice president of one of the companies with which I
00:42:09.68 --> 00:42:14.88 am associated. He would formulate some good plans, but never followed up to see that his plans
00:42:14.88 --> 00:42:21.44 got the expected results. I knew he had served in World War II. So out of curiosity, I looked into
00:42:21.44 --> 00:42:26.48 the nature of his service and found that his entire period of service was a staff officer. He had
00:42:26.48 --> 00:42:31.52 never had the advantage of a command job. So his training was incomplete. Maybe if he had remained
00:42:31.52 --> 00:42:35.52 in the service longer, he would have developed his leadership qualities as well. And this man
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:42.72 would still be with the company. So if you're not able to execute things, your ID, this is now
00:42:42.72 --> 00:42:47.76 see now I'm starting to get mad because because it does bother me when people just want to throw
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:54.40 on ideas and they don't push him to completion. That's that's unsat. That's unsat. And yeah,
00:42:54.40 --> 00:42:58.24 you didn't even talk about that could deal to. We're talking about that, too. It's like a sin.
00:42:58.24 --> 00:43:03.20 Yeah. You don't follow through. And all this. So and that is true, which kind of takes me back to
00:43:03.20 --> 00:43:09.20 what about that idea guy who's like you stole my idea, right? It's like it kind of makes that
00:43:09.20 --> 00:43:15.60 thing a little bit more angry. Like it makes you mad a little bit more. One of the
00:43:15.60 --> 00:43:20.64 person is like, hey, that was my idea. It's like, you're like, you're you're a low utility person.
00:43:20.64 --> 00:43:27.04 You don't execute on anything ever. And now this was your idea and you somehow deserve something
00:43:27.04 --> 00:43:33.52 for the success of the idea. Meanwhile, you provided in my opinion, less than 1% of the ideas
00:43:34.56 --> 00:43:41.12 success. Yeah. Yeah. When you get into these hypothetical scenarios where the person is basically
00:43:41.12 --> 00:43:46.72 not really creating the idea for the purpose of being executed, maybe that's the line. But if you're
00:43:46.72 --> 00:43:50.48 creating an idea in your acting, if you've created an idea in your actively trying to get people
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:55.84 executed on it, I'll probably I will take care of you. If you're not even intentionally trying to
00:43:55.84 --> 00:44:01.04 create something, first of all, you're used not no factor in the world. Like how would I even know
00:44:01.04 --> 00:44:06.48 who you are? You're not you don't even step up. You don't leave a trail of, hey, that connects you
00:44:06.48 --> 00:44:13.28 to this idea. Yeah. So it's no factor. Actually, zero factor. The person is just unsat.
00:44:15.92 --> 00:44:20.24 You may have heard heard this story about General Persia in World War I, while inspecting a
00:44:20.24 --> 00:44:24.80 certain area, he found a project that was not going too well. Even though a second lieutenant
00:44:24.80 --> 00:44:29.04 in charge seemed to have a pretty good plan. General Persia asked the lieutenant how much pay you received.
00:44:29.04 --> 00:44:35.84 When the lieutenant replied, $141.67 per month, sir. General Persia said, just remember that you
00:44:35.84 --> 00:44:42.48 get a dollar 67 for making your plan an issuing the order and $140 for seeing that it's carried out.
00:44:44.56 --> 00:44:50.24 Yeah, you need people like that. And I'll tell you, this is another thing,
00:44:50.24 --> 00:44:56.56 would that go in the next book? Well, maybe not the next book. It'll go into the next ancient
00:44:56.56 --> 00:45:02.88 technique book. I'm going to ancient technique will be getting things, getting the troops to execute
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:09.44 the plan. How do you do that? Because this is again, he brushes up against these things.
00:45:10.16 --> 00:45:13.52 Like, hey, we all know that it sucks that if your team isn't doing what they're supposed to do,
00:45:13.92 --> 00:45:18.72 how do we actually get them to do it? Right? What are the leadership strategy and tactics,
00:45:18.72 --> 00:45:23.04 which some of which I do talk about in leadership strategy and tactics, how you get the people
00:45:23.04 --> 00:45:28.000 to actually get the job done that you want them to do. And part of it has to do with, you know,
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.52 this guy seemed to have come up with a pretty good plan. Well, if you let your troops come up,
00:45:31.52 --> 00:45:34.000 the plan, there's going to be a better chance of the execute it. As we know,
00:45:36.40 --> 00:45:42.24 so that might go into the ancient ancient procedures. Ancient techniques.
00:45:44.96 --> 00:45:51.52 You remember that video that I was in where I was talking about the ancient masters? Yes,
00:45:52.16 --> 00:45:57.20 the ancient masters. And I said something where you said to me, I could tell you were reaching
00:45:57.20 --> 00:46:04.56 for a word. Because I said something like, let me summon the power of the, and I didn't know what
00:46:04.56 --> 00:46:11.60 to say. I paid it by myself in the corner, and I said, the ancients, which by the way, may have been
00:46:11.60 --> 00:46:18.32 brood in my head from tenacious D, because he's got one of their, one of their, or the HBO
00:46:18.32 --> 00:46:24.48 specials, they talk about the ancients. And that's exactly what it came from. I had to summon
00:46:24.48 --> 00:46:34.08 up the D. They came through at the moment of truth. Because that, those videos, that particular video,
00:46:36.48 --> 00:46:42.96 for somebody's number, a little bit more, I have a little bit more fun when I'm annoyed.
00:46:43.76 --> 00:46:47.44 A little bit of a disillot. A little bit of no mocking in or something. So what happened was
00:46:47.44 --> 00:46:56.48 the female who was prompting me with different questions? She says, you know, so tell me, tell
00:46:56.48 --> 00:47:01.12 me what you do to get up in the morning. And I said, well, what I do is I sent my alarm clock,
00:47:01.12 --> 00:47:04.16 and I, when it goes off, I get out of bed, which is my standard answer I give in a thousand times.
00:47:05.04 --> 00:47:09.28 And then she says, no, no, no, but she said something along lines, and she was super cool.
00:47:09.28 --> 00:47:15.76 She said something along lines of, no, but I mean, I think my producers, can you give my producer more
00:47:15.76 --> 00:47:20.64 than that? And that's what I went into this whole thing. But it was just off the top of my head.
00:47:21.76 --> 00:47:28.80 But I got stuck for a word and the D delivered for me. Yes. So now there's me whole book connected
00:47:28.80 --> 00:47:37.60 to that. See that levels. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. All right, continuing on. He's, so we started
00:47:37.60 --> 00:47:45.04 about the person thing. You get paid $140. You get paid $1.67 from making the plan. You get paid $140
00:47:45.04 --> 00:47:48.88 for seeing that is carried out. He says, I'm not sure that I would go to that extreme.
00:47:48.88 --> 00:47:53.84 Certainly in these days, problems are complex and good staff work, plays a large part about
00:47:53.84 --> 00:47:59.20 resolving them. I have known commanders who are not too smart, but they were very knowledgeable about
00:47:59.20 --> 00:48:05.36 personnel and who knew enough to select the very best for their staffs. Remember, a good leader is
00:48:05.36 --> 00:48:15.60 one who causes or inspires others staff or subordinate commanders to do the job. Boy, I've known
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:21.68 commanders who are not too smart, but they were very knowledgeable. There's, I know there's all kinds
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:27.28 of like literature about this kind of thing, but there's different kinds of intelligence, right?
00:48:27.92 --> 00:48:34.96 Absolutely, different kinds of intelligence. And one of the least most important types of
00:48:34.96 --> 00:48:42.24 intelligence is book smart. When it comes to operating in the real world, one of the least
00:48:42.24 --> 00:48:48.96 important types of intelligence is, hey, I can memorize this for a test or I can understand these
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:55.04 kind of, if you can't read people, if you don't have the emotional intelligence, if you don't
00:48:55.04 --> 00:48:59.04 aren't able to react, if you aren't able to control your own emotion, there's about a million things.
00:48:59.04 --> 00:49:09.36 Yeah. So you can be not too smart and still do outstanding, especially if you're smart enough to
00:49:09.36 --> 00:49:16.24 go, you know what, I'm not that smart, but I got, I got Fred over here. You get some brain horse power,
00:49:16.24 --> 00:49:20.08 I'm gonna bring him on the team. I'm not gonna put him up in front of the troops because he
00:49:20.96 --> 00:49:27.60 fumbles around with his words, but I'm gonna have him going through my plan line by line,
00:49:27.60 --> 00:49:32.56 check in the numbers, making sure we're good to go, build the right team.
00:49:34.72 --> 00:49:39.60 Furthermore, no leader knows it all, although sometimes you find one who seems to think he does,
00:49:40.88 --> 00:49:45.44 a leader should encourage the members of his staff to speak up if they think their commander is wrong.
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:51.12 He should invite constructive criticism. It is a grave error for the leader to surround himself with a
00:49:51.12 --> 00:50:01.52 yes staff. Hence, no yes men, leadership strategy and tactics, do not surround yourself with
00:50:01.92 --> 00:50:09.12 yes men, speaking of ideas that have been stolen Omar Bradley. I stole that idea, I guess, and put it in a book.
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:18.56 General George C. Marshall was an excellent exponent of the principle of having his
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:23.04 support and speak up. When he first came to Chief Staff, when he first became Chief of Staff of the
00:50:23.04 --> 00:50:28.56 Army, the Secretary of that office consisted of three officers who presented early to General Marshall,
00:50:28.56 --> 00:50:33.84 the staff papers or studies coming from the divisions of the General Staff. I was a member of that
00:50:33.84 --> 00:50:40.40 secretary. We presented in a abbreviated form the contents of the staff studies, citing the highlights
00:50:40.40 --> 00:50:45.36 of the problem involved, the various possible courses of actions, considered, and the action
00:50:45.36 --> 00:50:50.56 recommended. At the end of his first week as Chief of Staff, Marshall called us into his office and
00:50:50.56 --> 00:50:57.84 opened the discussion by saying, I am disappointed in all of you. When we inquired, if we might ask
00:50:57.84 --> 00:51:04.24 why, he said, you haven't disagreed with a single thing I have done all week. We told him it just
00:51:04.24 --> 00:51:08.08 so happened that we were in full agreement with every paper that had been presented, that we knew
00:51:08.08 --> 00:51:13.36 he wanted and that we would add our comments to anything that we considered should be questioned.
00:51:13.36 --> 00:51:17.60 In the very next day, we presented a paper as written and then expressed some thoughts which,
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:23.44 in our own opinion, made the recommendation recommended action questionable. General Marshall said,
00:51:23.44 --> 00:51:30.16 now that is what I want. Unless I hear all the arguments against an action, I am not sure whether I am
00:51:30.16 --> 00:51:37.04 right or not. You don't want us around yourself with those people that are just going to tell you
00:51:37.04 --> 00:51:47.92 that right. Anyway, you feel that or you see that with the celebrities that surround themselves,
00:51:47.92 --> 00:51:51.84 with the people that just tell them, hey, you're the greatest, you're super, you can do whatever you
00:51:51.84 --> 00:51:56.64 want, and then you're watching on the downward spiral of destruction. They need someone going, hey,
00:51:58.16 --> 00:52:05.76 bro, stop. That's dumb. You might be able to get away with it, but you're not going to get away
00:52:05.76 --> 00:52:10.32 with it for long. And it's going to be hanging over you. That doesn't happen. They get surrounded by
00:52:10.32 --> 00:52:16.88 people that just blindly support them. Do you feel that it's like, I guess, when you think about it,
00:52:16.88 --> 00:52:22.08 it seems like a two-way street, right? Like the person, okay, so you don't want to surround yourself
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:26.72 with just men, right? And let's say you happen for like a better way of putting it, you happened
00:52:26.72 --> 00:52:31.36 to not surround yourself with yes, yes, men. It's not like you actively were like, hey,
00:52:31.36 --> 00:52:36.08 you're a yes man, and I don't really hang out with you. I just put it up with Fred and he's like,
00:52:36.08 --> 00:52:41.52 we'll push back and say, Dave, you trust him because you're both your friend or whatever, right?
00:52:43.04 --> 00:52:51.36 Versus the person who's like actively surrounding themselves with people were not yes men,
00:52:51.36 --> 00:52:56.88 right? But the two-way street kind of goes where if I'm not saying celebrities are like this,
00:52:56.88 --> 00:53:02.48 but some people in the world are like this where it's like, hey, and maybe they don't consciously
00:53:02.48 --> 00:53:06.56 think of it this way. They just go by their feeling and they're like, hey, this person doesn't agree
00:53:06.56 --> 00:53:11.28 with me like all the time. Like this person does. And when this person agrees with me all the time,
00:53:11.28 --> 00:53:14.48 it really makes me feel good. And this is just the feeling. They're not consciously,
00:53:15.68 --> 00:53:22.16 you're saying, you're saying that someone may just by small decision after small decision, after small
00:53:22.16 --> 00:53:28.64 decision over time, they just end up getting rid of everyone that gives them any objections.
00:53:28.64 --> 00:53:33.28 Yes. I think that's exactly what happens. I think that's why you have to proactively
00:53:34.08 --> 00:53:39.20 make sure you've got people on your team that are going to push back. You know, and I just was
00:53:40.08 --> 00:53:49.04 on the EF online today, I was talking about the fact that I was hyper paranoid about making sure
00:53:49.04 --> 00:53:56.08 I took input from other people. There was the when the seals went into Panama. They went into
00:53:56.08 --> 00:54:07.36 Petia Airfield was a rough operation lost four seals. And I worked for a guy that was there.
00:54:07.36 --> 00:54:14.48 He was on the boats that that put the seals in. And so he had been through the whole planning process
00:54:14.48 --> 00:54:20.88 and everything. And I asked him, I said, you know, what happened? He explained to me that what
00:54:20.88 --> 00:54:27.52 happened tactically on the ground. And I was kind of, okay, I get that. I was, I said,
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:34.96 but how did you, how did that plan? Because the plan seemed like it had some, some violations of
00:54:34.96 --> 00:54:42.64 sort of fundamental, like normal tactics that seals use. And he just said that there was a
00:54:42.64 --> 00:54:46.08 couple of guys that kind of work, no, this is what we're going to do in this work. It's going to work.
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:56.16 And there wasn't a lot of push back against it. So I always felt that it was really critical
00:54:56.16 --> 00:55:02.48 that you want push back and that you listen to it. Because if, you know, all those seals and,
00:55:02.48 --> 00:55:10.32 you know, those heroic guys that died on that airfield, if a plan can get through all those guys,
00:55:10.32 --> 00:55:16.72 all those seals, then we need to make sure our minds are open and we're listening and taking
00:55:16.72 --> 00:55:21.12 input. Because otherwise, if you, if you come up with a plan that you think is great.
00:55:21.76 --> 00:55:25.68 Now, when you hear a question about it, you've got to listen to the question. You've got to listen
00:55:25.68 --> 00:55:33.76 to the question. So it's, for that it's a hard trick. Like, you know, when you come out with a plan
00:55:33.76 --> 00:55:40.24 or an idea or whatever of video, whatever. And you show it to someone or you present it,
00:55:40.24 --> 00:55:44.80 and here's the thing, when you come up with a comprehensive plan that you're happy about,
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:48.96 you're fired up, you know, I know what you're going with us and you're like saying how hard it is.
00:55:48.96 --> 00:55:58.56 I am so conditioned at this point to be paranoid. I was trying to figure out where that came from
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:04.000 in my head and it came from that situation from hearing that guy who ended up, I ended up working
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.44 for hearing him explain to me, hey, there wasn't enough pushback and we went forward with a plan
00:56:11.44 --> 00:56:16.32 that not everyone agreed with. And you think, I thought to myself, I'm never going to, so at this
00:56:16.32 --> 00:56:20.16 point, I come up with a plan for anything which normally, as you know, I try not to, I try to let
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:27.52 out of everybody else come up with a plan. But sometimes I do come up with a plan. And I'm so comfortable
00:56:27.52 --> 00:56:31.76 with someone saying, hey, I don't like that. It doesn't have any impact on me whatsoever. So
00:56:31.76 --> 00:56:36.08 easy for me to say, actually the right point didn't think of that. Yeah, man, that's so good because
00:56:36.08 --> 00:56:40.08 you, and you, you know, you've put it, you're the one who put it like this where it's like you don't
00:56:40.08 --> 00:56:45.04 emotionally attach yourself to the plan. But I guess that's the really the point that's hard.
00:56:45.04 --> 00:56:53.28 I watched seal, but tune after seal, but tune after seal, but tune, get so wrapped around the
00:56:53.28 --> 00:57:00.40 axle of the plan of my plan. My plan. And you know, normally at the end of the day,
00:57:00.40 --> 00:57:03.92 and this is when I was running training, I would watch, because I'd sit there and watch
00:57:03.92 --> 00:57:09.20 and plan and you're, I'm defacto detached because I'm sitting back watching them plan. But you would
00:57:09.20 --> 00:57:15.60 see them just go down the road of arguing with each other about my plan versus your plan.
00:57:15.60 --> 00:57:19.84 Both the plans are work fine. I'll tell you what, won't work. It's trying to plant, do the plan
00:57:19.84 --> 00:57:25.28 in 20 minutes because you've wasted four hours arguing about which plan is better. And I would
00:57:25.28 --> 00:57:31.60 see that all the time. Yeah, you know, that yeah, I feel, I'm not going to say I've gone through this.
00:57:31.60 --> 00:57:36.88 I'm not going to say I've not gone through this, but you know, you show someone a video that you
00:57:36.88 --> 00:57:42.64 might have made or whatever. And you're like you say, hey, you know, tell me what you think of this
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:47.76 video before you release it or something like that. And really, when you really be honest, this is
00:57:47.76 --> 00:57:52.16 what it is. Half of your brain is like, hey, I need some feedback to make it the best I can.
00:57:52.16 --> 00:57:56.40 And let me give you a look just so I can get some good feedback, you know, on improving it, that's
00:57:56.40 --> 00:58:01.92 half. The other half of your brain is kind of like, hey, this is kind of the premiere a little bit.
00:58:01.92 --> 00:58:08.000 And I want to get rewarded for my work, you know, with, with, you know, praise and hopefully
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.92 applause or something, you know, kind of like that. So it's like your two sides of your brain.
00:58:11.92 --> 00:58:17.04 So one, when you do have to get feedback, where it's like, hey, I would improve this. I would
00:58:17.04 --> 00:58:21.44 do this or at that beginning, got to change it or whatever. That second part of your brain is
00:58:21.44 --> 00:58:24.32 kind of like, bro, why did I even show it to you? Like you're not even looking
00:58:24.32 --> 00:58:28.88 being cool about it, you know, kind of, kind of an attitude, you know, that's the part.
00:58:28.88 --> 00:58:35.44 Once again, this is where humility is so important, because otherwise you just don't
00:58:35.44 --> 00:58:39.28 improve anything. I don't know. Hey, if I show someone a piece of writing and they go, yeah,
00:58:39.28 --> 00:58:43.76 you know, I like this, but you can do this different. I'm like, okay, cool. And sometimes,
00:58:43.76 --> 00:58:54.48 I just wrote a piece and I sent it to one of my editors and look, I will say they wrote 100
00:58:54.48 --> 00:59:00.40 things. Well, let's say they wrote 50 things. Of the 50 things that they wrote, I accepted,
00:59:01.52 --> 00:59:08.64 I don't know, 93% of them. There was one major change. The only, the most significant
00:59:08.64 --> 00:59:14.48 change in the piece. And I said, hey, I appreciate the feedback. I'm not changing that thing.
00:59:15.12 --> 00:59:19.28 And it wasn't because of Eagle, it's like, okay, I read it five times and said, you know what?
00:59:19.28 --> 00:59:26.56 That's absolutely needs to be in there. And I saw her perspective and said, you know what?
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:33.84 I get where she's coming from, but this ties everything together. And I think that's what I
00:59:33.84 --> 00:59:42.72 didn't do a good job explaining to her. But yes, you have to at least be open to it. You have to
00:59:42.72 --> 00:59:47.76 at least be open to it. Yeah, yeah, admitting to yourself that you're like, and going to it with the
00:59:47.76 --> 00:59:55.84 attitude of, hey, I have to actually strongly be able to defend my position. And if I can't defend my
00:59:55.84 --> 01:00:00.48 position, then you're probably right, right, like on a logical level almost. Yeah, not like,
01:00:00.48 --> 01:00:06.24 hey, that was cool. You put down that my writing, you know, like not that added. Yeah, you know,
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:12.16 Mike, just like I say, well, my goal is to listen to if you and I are working together and I'm in
01:00:12.16 --> 01:00:16.16 charge and we're going to attack a target. My goal is to have you come up with the plan. That's my
01:00:16.16 --> 01:00:20.48 absolute goal. When you come to the plan, I'm not looking at it. What's wrong with it? I'm saying,
01:00:20.48 --> 01:00:25.52 what's right with it? I like it. I like your plan better than what I thought I was going to think.
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:30.08 When you bring me a piece of, when I bring you a piece of writing and you give me feedback,
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:37.76 my goal is to go, okay, your feedback is correct and I'm wrong. And unless it just
01:00:38.72 --> 01:00:45.36 pains me to change something, then I'm going to lean towards your recommendation. Yeah,
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:51.44 that's a good way to look at it. It's like you're writing or whatever, you're completed to work
01:00:51.44 --> 01:00:56.32 that you need feedback on. It's like you just, if you go in automatic, the regarding it as this,
01:00:56.32 --> 01:01:01.12 there's a problem with this. There's holes in this, it's missing stuff and it has too much of
01:01:01.12 --> 01:01:07.76 some other stuff. Yeah. I know that for a fact and it that upsets me. I'm going to go to this person
01:01:07.76 --> 01:01:13.52 and they can identify them, these things. That's it. Yeah. Not how awesome it is. It's like,
01:01:13.52 --> 01:01:17.60 there's a problem with this and I need this problem to be solving this person and tell it.
01:01:17.60 --> 01:01:24.72 I was listening to Brian Kaufman on Tim Ferriss's podcast. Brian Kaufman and David Levine
01:01:24.72 --> 01:01:30.40 are the writers of the show, Billions. Have you heard of the show? I have. I hear good things.
01:01:31.52 --> 01:01:35.92 But it was interesting because Brian Kaufman, I wish I could remember exactly what he said.
01:01:36.64 --> 01:01:41.60 There's two things that he said. Number one, if he's going to give somebody something for feedback
01:01:41.60 --> 01:01:48.40 on something that he's written, you don't give someone their completed project and say,
01:01:48.40 --> 01:01:53.44 hey, can you give me some feedback on this because I already finished it. What you're really asking,
01:01:53.44 --> 01:02:00.32 if I say, hey, echo, I wrote this book. Can you give me some feedback on it? Yeah. That's sort of
01:02:01.68 --> 01:02:06.80 it's sort of a bad thing. I have to say, hey, echo. This is just a draft. Yeah. And then he had
01:02:06.80 --> 01:02:13.20 some response of saying something like, do you want me to read it? Or do you want feedback? He had
01:02:13.20 --> 01:02:18.56 some way of saying, hey, you want me to really go to town on this thing or do you just want me to
01:02:18.56 --> 01:02:24.08 read it? You just want me to watch this video that you made or do you want feedback? How was
01:02:24.08 --> 01:02:28.64 I could think, would you say something something, do you want professional feedback or something like that?
01:02:28.64 --> 01:02:35.12 Something that was, hey, look, if I give this to you straight, it's going to sting. Yeah,
01:02:35.12 --> 01:02:39.92 that's the man. That's so good. Because it's almost like they're because they're two different people.
01:02:39.92 --> 01:02:45.20 They're two different roles you're asking this person to be. Do you want this person to be an audience member?
01:02:45.20 --> 01:02:50.24 Exactly. I can. Or do you want your own trick? And credit or editor or assistant? What
01:02:50.24 --> 01:02:55.36 you want? Yeah. So it's just two different attitudes. And that's, yeah, that's the emotional
01:02:55.36 --> 01:03:01.04 ego part versus the, you know, the technician or whatever the other guy is. Yeah. So those are
01:03:01.04 --> 01:03:07.68 you got to get that humble brain going. If you want to ask people for feedback and anything.
01:03:07.68 --> 01:03:15.04 And it stings every single time. So it works. Go back to the book. If you happen to be a
01:03:15.04 --> 01:03:19.36 detailed, detailed to a staff, trying to be a good staff officer and if possible, avoid being a
01:03:19.36 --> 01:03:24.08 yes man. I would suggest to all commanders that they inform the members of their staffs that
01:03:24.08 --> 01:03:30.48 anyone who does not agree once in a while with what is about to be done is of limited value and
01:03:30.48 --> 01:03:35.68 perhaps should be shifted to some other place where he might occasionally have an idea.
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:40.96 Over here, just an agreement all the time. I don't need you. I don't need you.
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:50.40 Of course, I'm thinking about the decision making process. After a decision is made, everyone must be
01:03:50.40 --> 01:03:56.40 100% behind it. I thought the British were admirable in this respect during World War II, no
01:03:56.40 --> 01:04:00.64 matter how much discussion they're had been on a subject. As soon as a decision was made, you never
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:05.68 heard any doubts expressed. You had to believe that everyone involved in making that decision
01:04:05.68 --> 01:04:09.68 had never entertained any ideas except those expressed in this decision. You know how I used
01:04:09.68 --> 01:04:15.20 to explain this to the young junior officers, because I used to say once a decision is made,
01:04:15.20 --> 01:04:22.08 you executed as if it was your own. Now here's where people will freak out about that, right?
01:04:22.08 --> 01:04:26.24 They freak out about that because they think, but what if I don't really agree with it?
01:04:26.24 --> 01:04:32.88 If you don't really agree with it, check a couple things. Number one, if echo comes up with a plan
01:04:33.60 --> 01:04:36.64 and you're my boss and you're telling me how we're going to do something and I'm like, no, we need
01:04:36.64 --> 01:04:40.56 to do it this way. The first thing I need to check, and finally you're like, no, we're doing it this
01:04:40.56 --> 01:04:43.76 way. That's the decision we're going forward. The first thing I need to check is, what do you think
01:04:43.76 --> 01:04:50.24 it is? Take a guess. Yes, I need to check my ego. Because I would say upwards of 90%
01:04:50.24 --> 01:04:56.64 90% of the time, the only reason I disagree is because of my ego. Because I got some little
01:04:56.64 --> 01:05:03.04 idea and I think my way would be better. And even if my way is better, it's not drastically
01:05:03.04 --> 01:05:09.52 better because we're both fighting for the same cause. Right? How often is it a boss is like,
01:05:10.48 --> 01:05:15.28 hey, we want to execute this way and someone says, hey, that's a really horrible way to do.
01:05:15.28 --> 01:05:21.44 It's going to be unsafe for the team members and it's going to not, it's going to lose money. And
01:05:21.44 --> 01:05:25.04 the boss, because I don't care. No, we're doing it my way. No, he goes, wait, wait a second,
01:05:25.04 --> 01:05:28.08 what are you talking about? Explain this to me. How is it unsafe and how are we going to lose money?
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:36.64 So the idea is, first thing you check is, is it my ego that's preventing me from accepting
01:05:36.64 --> 01:05:43.28 this new idea? What are the degrees of variance between my idea and the way it's actually happening?
01:05:43.28 --> 01:05:48.80 Because if the degrees of variance are minimal, then shut up and go and execute the plan as if it
01:05:48.80 --> 01:05:55.36 was your own. Now, if there are significant degrees of variance where it's going to be a really bad
01:05:55.36 --> 01:05:59.92 situation and I hate to use the word catastrophic. But certainly, if you see a catastrophic problem,
01:05:59.92 --> 01:06:07.84 then you go, hey, we cannot do this. This is not good. And you don't go forward if it's going to be
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:11.84 catastrophic or again, go back to leadership strategy. And taxes and you've got to make it as
01:06:11.84 --> 01:06:15.76 then you've got to figure out, is it better for me to go ahead with it? But now I can go mitigate the damage,
01:06:16.64 --> 01:06:20.72 mitigate the risk as much as possible. That might be what you have to do. So
01:06:22.80 --> 01:06:28.24 that idea of executing as if you believe it as if it's your own, which is what you should do.
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:34.96 You need to have those conversations. Listen, put your ego in check and then if it's close enough,
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:38.000 you go Roger that. Boss, I'm on board with the plan. Let's go execute it. And you do
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:47.60 execute it as if it's your own. No factor. Continuing on, I don't want to over-emphasize
01:06:47.60 --> 01:06:52.64 leadership of senior officers. So you just don't want to just talk about senior officers.
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:57.04 My interest extends to leaders of all ranks. I would caution you to remember that an essential
01:06:57.04 --> 01:07:01.52 qualification of a good leader is the ability to recognize, select, and train junior officers.
01:07:01.52 --> 01:07:09.84 I would like to quote from a book entitled, The Born at Reveley, written by Colonel Red Reader.
01:07:09.84 --> 01:07:14.64 Colonel Reader was on a trip for general martial and one of his assignments was to
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:21.12 inquire into junior leadership. This is an account of his conversation with Colonel Bryant Moore
01:07:21.12 --> 01:07:26.80 on Guadalcanal. Quote, Colonel Moore, I said, tell me something about leadership.
01:07:26.80 --> 01:07:34.000 I had hit a sensitive spot. Colonel Moore forged ahead leadership. The greatest problem here is
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.76 the leaders. And you have to find some way to weed out the weak ones. It is tough to do this
01:07:39.76 --> 01:07:44.88 when you're in combat. The platoon leaders who cannot command, who cannot foresee things,
01:07:44.88 --> 01:07:51.04 and who cannot act on the spur of the moment in an emergency are a distinct detriment.
01:07:51.04 --> 01:07:57.84 This is clear, right? We know this. But there you have it reinforced for the one million
01:07:57.84 --> 01:08:02.96 time. If you've got weak leaders, you're going to have problems. If you can't command,
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:06.88 if you can't foresee things, and if you can't act on spur of the moment,
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.20 you're going to have problems. When's the last time you heard that's a negative thing, right?
01:08:11.20 --> 01:08:14.40 Oh, he acts on the spur of the moment. Actually, there's sometimes where you need to do that.
01:08:16.64 --> 01:08:20.80 He continues on. It's hot here as you can see men struggle. They get heat exhaustion.
01:08:20.80 --> 01:08:25.60 They come out vomiting and throwing away equipment. The leaders must be leaders.
01:08:26.40 --> 01:08:31.20 And they must be alert enough to establish straggler lines and stop this thing.
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:37.52 And I need to do, I try to research this in order of the book.
01:08:38.24 --> 01:08:40.80 If the book is actually for sale, it's called Born and Reveal.
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:45.68 It got some interesting reviews. It seems like a good book, where they say,
01:08:45.68 --> 01:08:50.40 I guess it's written in some offensive language in modern era.
01:08:51.52 --> 01:08:56.88 So, but I, because I wasn't really a hundred percent. The leaders must be leaders,
01:08:56.88 --> 01:09:01.36 and that they must be alert enough to establish straggler lines and stop this thing.
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.72 I guess he's talking about heat exhaustion, right? He must be.
01:09:06.72 --> 01:09:11.36 straggler lines are lines of people that aren't ready to fight and stop this thing.
01:09:11.36 --> 01:09:16.96 I'm assuming he's talking about the heat exhaustion. So it goes on. And this is why I think that's what
01:09:16.96 --> 01:09:21.04 it means. The men have been taught to take salt tablets, but leaders don't see to this.
01:09:21.04 --> 01:09:29.12 Result heat exhaustion. The good leaders seem to get killed. The poor leaders get the men killed.
01:09:29.76 --> 01:09:34.48 The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps on the right people.
01:09:34.48 --> 01:09:41.60 And then the book continues 60 millimeter mortars, mortar shells fell about 30 yards away
01:09:41.60 --> 01:09:46.40 and attacked a number of coconut trees. I lost interest in taking dictation and the Colonel
01:09:46.40 --> 01:09:51.04 stopped talking. When the salvo was over and things were quiet again, Brian Moore said,
01:09:51.04 --> 01:09:57.52 where was I? You saw that patrol. I tell you this, not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this
01:09:57.52 --> 01:10:03.52 jungle. If you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit the combat zone,
01:10:03.52 --> 01:10:11.76 you have found out something. Now what's interesting about that is first of all,
01:10:12.80 --> 01:10:17.44 one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this jungle. That's a significant statement.
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:23.36 And I will tell you, he says, if you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit
01:10:23.36 --> 01:10:26.08 the combat zone, you found out something. How do you do that? You do that by putting them in
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:31.28 these pressure situations. We had such a benefit. Our guys were so ready. We put these
01:10:31.28 --> 01:10:36.64 guy. We put, I put my, I put the seals going on deployment through training like that where you
01:10:36.64 --> 01:10:42.80 could see them break. You could see them not be able to handle it or what's more important.
01:10:42.80 --> 01:10:47.28 They wouldn't be able to handle it day one, day two. They'd be a little better, day three. They'd
01:10:47.28 --> 01:10:51.52 be a little bit better, day four. They'd be a little bit better. By the end of a six month workup,
01:10:52.40 --> 01:10:56.72 they're actually one of the people that can make these make these things happen.
01:10:56.72 --> 01:11:02.80 So it's not just about finding the good patrol leaders. It's about training them.
01:11:05.76 --> 01:11:10.64 He says, I have to get rid of about 25 officers because they just, I've had to get rid of about
01:11:10.64 --> 01:11:15.28 25 officers because they just weren't leaders. I had to make the batiding commander weed out the
01:11:15.28 --> 01:11:19.76 poor leaders. This process continues other junior leaders are finding out that they must no more
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:27.68 than they're men, more about their men. The good leaders know their men. Of everything he talks
01:11:27.68 --> 01:11:32.08 about, he says, the thing that he gives that you must know your men. That's the thing that that's
01:11:32.08 --> 01:11:36.16 that's the one that he doesn't say. They need a navigation. They need to work on your fire. He said,
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:43.52 they need to know their men. Very interesting thing to focus on for for this guy talking,
01:11:43.52 --> 01:11:51.92 for general more talking about this or Colonel Moore. But I will tell you that
01:11:53.68 --> 01:11:59.28 having to get rid of about 25 officers, I'm going to go ahead out on a limb here. And I don't know
01:11:59.28 --> 01:12:04.24 how many officers he went through. But some of those officers could have been trained.
01:12:05.04 --> 01:12:07.92 Could have been trained. Could have been prepared. Could have been molded. Could have been
01:12:07.92 --> 01:12:12.88 and could have been educated. Could have been tested. Prior to going to combat, he probably would have
01:12:12.88 --> 01:12:22.96 done better than having to get rid of 25 of them. Continuing on, what then are the characters?
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:28.32 What then are the distinguishing qualities of a leader? There are many essential characteristics
01:12:28.32 --> 01:12:33.12 that he must possess. But I will mention a few that come to mind as perhaps the most important.
01:12:33.12 --> 01:12:38.64 First, he must know his job without necessarily being a specialist in any in every phase of it.
01:12:38.64 --> 01:12:43.52 A few years ago, he suggested that all engineers, all engineering subjects, be eliminated
01:12:43.52 --> 01:12:48.40 from the required studies at West Point. I objected. For example, bridge building is especially for
01:12:48.40 --> 01:12:53.20 engineers. Yet, I think every senior officer should have some idea of what is involved.
01:12:53.84 --> 01:12:58.88 When we reached the Rhine in World War II, it was not necessary that I know how to build a bridge.
01:12:58.88 --> 01:13:04.000 But it was very helpful that I knew what was involved so that I could see the bridge engineers
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.04 received proper support, in tonnage, allowed, and an idea of the time involved.
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:14.80 So first, know your job. You have to know everything about it. I didn't know the sniper weapons
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:18.88 this good. This sniper's did. I didn't know the radio. This is good. This is the radio man did.
01:13:19.68 --> 01:13:26.56 I didn't know the route. This is the point man did. But I knew enough about him. Continuing on,
01:13:26.56 --> 01:13:29.68 specialty is dominated almost every problem faced by the military today.
01:13:31.68 --> 01:13:36.000 By the, but face today by the military leader or the business manager. This individual must
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.56 get deeply enough into his problem that he can understand it and intelligently manage it.
01:13:40.56 --> 01:13:44.56 Without going so far as to become a specialist himself in every phase of the problem,
01:13:45.36 --> 01:13:51.12 you don't have to be a tank expert in order to effectively use a tank unit of your command.
01:13:51.12 --> 01:13:59.52 Thomas J. Watson of IBM once said that the genius of an executive is the ability to deal
01:13:59.52 --> 01:14:05.20 successfully with matters he does not understand. This leads to another principle of leadership,
01:14:05.20 --> 01:14:09.36 which I have often found neglected both in the military and in business. While you need to be a
01:14:09.36 --> 01:14:14.24 specialist in all phases of your job, you should have a proportionate degree of interest in
01:14:14.24 --> 01:14:22.16 every aspect of it and those concerned your subordinates should be aware of your interest. So you,
01:14:22.16 --> 01:14:27.52 you should be interested in what is happening. You must get around and show interest in what
01:14:27.52 --> 01:14:32.32 your subordinates are doing even if you don't know much about the technique of their work.
01:14:33.36 --> 01:14:39.12 And you make these when you are making these visits try to pass out praise when do as well as
01:14:39.12 --> 01:14:46.32 corrections or criticism. That's an interesting one. It's very interesting. What Omar Bradley points
01:14:46.32 --> 01:14:51.28 out here that, hey, not only should you know what's happening but you should show interest in
01:14:51.28 --> 01:14:56.80 what your subordinates do. You know how I would translate that. I would call it building relationships.
01:14:56.80 --> 01:15:00.56 It's a little degree of relationship. That's what he's talking about. He's talking about building
01:15:00.56 --> 01:15:05.12 relationships showing interest being out there. Building relationships with your troops.
01:15:05.12 --> 01:15:12.56 Again, I think a lot of times in this speech, he's either brushing up or he's using his own
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:21.92 verbiage to cover to talk about the same things that we talk about all the time. The same things
01:15:21.92 --> 01:15:29.60 that I write about all the time. Continue on, we tend to speak up only when things go wrong.
01:15:29.60 --> 01:15:34.96 This is such a well-recognized fact that a complaint department isn't in an essential part of many
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:40.88 business firms. To my knowledge, no comparable facility exists anywhere to expedite the handling of
01:15:40.88 --> 01:15:47.36 praise for a job well done. It need not be extravagant. We all get enough criticism and we learn
01:15:47.36 --> 01:15:53.52 to take it. Even Sir Winston Churchill, despite his matchless accomplishment, found occasion to say,
01:15:53.52 --> 01:16:00.08 I have benefited enormously from criticism and at no point did I suffer from any perceptible lack
01:16:00.08 --> 01:16:07.20 thereof. But let us remember that praise also has a role to play. Napoleon was probably the finest
01:16:07.20 --> 01:16:11.60 exponent of this principle of recognition through his use of a quarter inch of ribbon to improve
01:16:11.60 --> 01:16:19.76 the morale and get results. So interesting that Bradley is very focused on praise.
01:16:21.28 --> 01:16:25.44 Very interesting that he's focused on praise. You can see what kind of a different guy is
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:32.40 than Pat. And by the way, I forgot to say this. His book, Much of the movie patent, the famous
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:42.16 movie Oscar award winning movie patent. It was a lot of it was based on on that book that he wrote,
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:48.72 a soldier story. It's clean because there's two different philosophies right with the praise thing.
01:16:48.72 --> 01:16:54.96 Yeah, you know, you just get the feeling that Omar Bradley was a little bit a lot more.
01:16:57.92 --> 01:17:04.72 A lot more humble, a lot more open and probably hey, good job buddy. Where you don't expect
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:09.44 Pat and to say hey, good job buddy. Unless it's some crazy situation. I told the job soldier.
01:17:09.44 --> 01:17:13.92 Right. But you picture Omar Bradley going, hey, nice work on that. That was good. You don't really
01:17:13.92 --> 01:17:20.40 saw him just saying it's an interesting thing for him to keen and on. It feels like there's
01:17:20.40 --> 01:17:25.60 I mean, maybe it goes with different personalities or whatever, but okay, so on one hand you have
01:17:25.60 --> 01:17:29.04 the guy who's always saying good job. One's good job. Different corrections when that's
01:17:29.04 --> 01:17:35.12 right. I can't make it out of both. So they're essentially it's almost like you're constantly
01:17:35.12 --> 01:17:41.44 in touch with how they're feeling about you kind of thing as a worker or as whatever. So it's
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:46.64 like, it'll be like good job. Every little thing is either a good job or hey, you could do this
01:17:46.64 --> 01:17:50.24 a little bit better. Every single little thing. Right. So it's like you kind of know where you
01:17:50.24 --> 01:17:55.04 stand and it's kind of comforting, I guess in that way. But at the same time, it's kind of like
01:17:55.04 --> 01:17:59.20 Wendy, you know when you really did a good job. You don't really know as much you're not
01:17:59.20 --> 01:18:03.84 telling touch, but the opposite, the other guy who doesn't say anything, you do a little good job.
01:18:03.84 --> 01:18:10.08 You won't hear nothing ever. You'll know about the corrections for sure, but they tend and I'm
01:18:10.08 --> 01:18:14.72 speaking from experience more than anything. They tend to be like big corrections if you have to
01:18:14.72 --> 01:18:19.68 make it, you know, because it's no, if it's no factor corrections or it's like, you know, whatever,
01:18:19.68 --> 01:18:25.04 like, fine, it's a 80% solution and it's cool, whatever. Meanwhile, they don't say much as what I'm
01:18:25.04 --> 01:18:31.44 saying until something's a big deal good or bad. So really it kind of makes you want to strive
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:36.48 to get that big compliment, you know, more so than. So it's less comforting, I guess, day to
01:18:36.48 --> 01:18:42.16 day, but at the same time, it's almost like this intangible motivation to do a good job for this guy,
01:18:42.16 --> 01:18:48.64 you know, you're kind of seems like that. Yeah, it's a dichotomy that's got to be balanced.
01:18:48.64 --> 01:18:51.76 You don't want to go overboard, you don't want to be compiling every little thing, you know,
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.04 apart from every little thing either. I would say you are correct. It's better to back off a
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:05.84 little bit and have your, have your compliments or your criticisms be worthy of either one of those things.
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:14.08 Smaller corrections more often are easier to give than big corrections when people aren't used to
01:19:14.08 --> 01:19:19.60 see kind of conditions someone, right? You can condition someone and it's good to do this. If
01:19:19.60 --> 01:19:25.20 if I condition someone where they expect like, hey, some some pretty straightforward feedback,
01:19:25.20 --> 01:19:30.80 that's a totally positive thing. If you're not conditioned to it and all of a sudden I hammer you
01:19:30.80 --> 01:19:37.20 with something, it's a blow, you know, it hurts and it might even make you defensive. But if I'm
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:42.48 constantly not constantly to the point of being annoying, but if I'm on a regular basis, I'm telling
01:19:42.48 --> 01:19:46.08 you, oh, echo, you know, can you adjust this thing when you when you put these things out or hey,
01:19:46.08 --> 01:19:52.48 echo, when you when you get when you get when you get done with the project, the report needs to have
01:19:52.48 --> 01:19:59.36 more detail in it. Okay. Well, the more I correct you and again, I got to be careful,
01:19:59.36 --> 01:20:04.08 can't go overboard, but I got to get your condition to where you understand that I am going to
01:20:04.88 --> 01:20:11.36 give you some some feedback, some negative feedback about what you're doing. Don't want to
01:20:11.36 --> 01:20:15.52 harp on you. It's really hard to tell, right? Because a lot of times people just sit there and take
01:20:15.52 --> 01:20:26.000 it and they go and kick their dog because they're mad at their boss. All right. The next little
01:20:27.12 --> 01:20:32.24 characteristic of a leader he says, both mental and physical energy are essential to successful
01:20:32.24 --> 01:20:38.32 leadership. How many really good leaders have you known who are lazy or weak or who couldn't stand the
01:20:38.32 --> 01:20:44.80 strain? Sherman was a good example of a leader without standing mental and physical energy. I cite
01:20:44.80 --> 01:20:51.92 him with some trepidation because some of you may be from Georgia. However, during the advance from
01:20:51.92 --> 01:20:59.20 Chad and Nuga to Atlanta, he often went for days with only two hours of sleep per night and was
01:20:59.20 --> 01:21:05.20 constantly in the saddle, doing reconnaissance and he often knew the dispositions and terrain so well
01:21:05.20 --> 01:21:11.36 that he could maneuver the enemy out of position without a serious fight with minimal losses. So general
01:21:11.36 --> 01:21:20.96 to come to Sherman, who marched to the sea, $100 million worth of damage in Georgia as he kind of
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:28.88 destroyed things as he went. But showing that he had this high level of energy continues conversely,
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:34.48 a sick commander is a limited value. It is not fair to the troops under him to have a leader who is
01:21:34.48 --> 01:21:39.68 not functioning 100%. I had to relieve several senior commanders during World War II because of illness.
01:21:39.68 --> 01:21:45.52 It's often pointed out that Napoleon didn't lose a major battle until Waterloo where he was a sick man.
01:21:49.28 --> 01:21:55.92 A leadership possessed human understanding and consideration for others. Men are not robots and should
01:21:55.92 --> 01:22:01.68 not be treated as though they were machines. I do not by any means suggest coddling. There's another
01:22:01.68 --> 01:22:05.76 example of the dichotomy, right? Don't treat him as if machines, but don't coddle him. But
01:22:05.76 --> 01:22:10.32 men are highly intelligent, complicated beings who will respond favorably to human understanding and
01:22:10.32 --> 01:22:17.28 consideration. By this means their leader will get maximum effort from each of them. You will also
01:22:17.28 --> 01:22:24.40 get loyalty. And in this connection it will it is well to remember that loyalty goes down as well as
01:22:24.40 --> 01:22:30.24 up the sincere leader will go to bat for his subordinates when such action is needed.
01:22:30.24 --> 01:22:38.80 Pretty straightforward dichotomy right there. A good leader must sometimes be stubborn.
01:22:40.24 --> 01:22:45.12 Here I am reminded of the West Point cadet prayer and part of that prayer says, I leader must be
01:22:45.12 --> 01:22:51.12 able to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong. Armed with the courage of his convictions,
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:58.000 he must fight to defend them. Then he has to come to a decision after thorough analysis.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.64 And when he is sure he is right, he must stick to it even to the point of stubbornness. Grant
01:23:04.64 --> 01:23:10.32 furnaces a good illustration of this trait. He never knew when he was supposed to be left.
01:23:10.32 --> 01:23:19.12 A less stubborn man might have lost at Shiloh. By the way, Shiloh 24,000 dead in two days.
01:23:19.68 --> 01:23:24.72 Total nightmare. Maybe you've heard a story of General Grant and Richmond campaign when,
01:23:24.72 --> 01:23:28.80 after being up all night making his reconnaissance and formulating and issuing orders,
01:23:28.80 --> 01:23:33.28 he laid down a fell asleep under tree. Sometime later a career wrote up and informed General
01:23:33.28 --> 01:23:36.96 informed the general that disaster and he is right flank. And that is troops.
01:23:38.08 --> 01:23:41.68 At the end of the line, we're in full retreat. General Grant sat up. Shiloh
01:23:41.68 --> 01:23:45.52 his head declared the cobwebs and said, it can't be so and went back to sleep.
01:23:45.92 --> 01:23:50.000 And it wasn't so. He had confidence in himself and in his subordinate leaders.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.92 A little hard for me to accept that one. I may give a little bit more attention if someone
01:23:55.92 --> 01:24:02.88 comes and tells me of my flank is collapsing. But the point being he had confidence, hey,
01:24:02.88 --> 01:24:08.80 we're going to be all right. Yeah. Yeah. That seemed like a little tail. I mean, I don't know.
01:24:08.80 --> 01:24:12.72 Obviously, I don't know if that's true or not. I'm assuming it's true, but it seemed like more of an
01:24:12.72 --> 01:24:19.20 exaggerated tail. Like straight up sleepy. Yeah. Straight up. There's a picture of Dave Birkin. I
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:25.52 good deal to. Yes. Where I think we're putting in combat outpost, Falcon, and downtown
01:24:25.52 --> 01:24:30.72 Ramadi. Yeah. And the picture is probably, I don't even know when the picture's taken,
01:24:30.72 --> 01:24:34.40 but we're both asleep. We're both of us sitting up against a wall we're both asleep. We
01:24:34.40 --> 01:24:42.56 privately asleep awake for 24 hours at this point. He's the commander of salt. 16. Yes, salt six.
01:24:42.56 --> 01:24:49.52 He's he was a lightning one six. And I was the commander of task unit, bruiser. And we're both just
01:24:49.52 --> 01:24:55.52 racked out. Yeah. We're in the go. But what in the combat outpost, the combat outposts was now secure.
01:24:55.52 --> 01:25:02.64 There's a bunch of guys from the 137 army just surrounding this thing and building it out.
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:08.80 And we get some sleep. So apparently we did. Yeah. Sleeping gets a bad rap, I guess.
01:25:08.80 --> 01:25:14.40 Now that you kind of mention it, you know, how sleeping on the job. Sleeping on a job. That's not a
01:25:14.40 --> 01:25:18.88 good expression. Like that expression is not a positive expression. Yes. You know, like hey, if you're
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:24.16 sleeping on the job, you're not doing a good job. Yeah. But if you, yeah, actually,
01:25:24.16 --> 01:25:28.48 Dave talks about the story. Like as soon as he would get into an Overwatch position and get it set up
01:25:28.48 --> 01:25:34.48 and get security set, he'd be like, cool. I'm going to say, come here. The planning cycle for
01:25:34.48 --> 01:25:39.12 like us officers going into the field. We would be planning basically the whole time. We're
01:25:39.12 --> 01:25:43.60 ready to go in. We would know that once we got in the field, we could get some sleep. Yeah.
01:25:43.60 --> 01:25:48.48 Because there's no chain of command breathing down your neck for another conops.
01:25:48.48 --> 01:25:54.08 Submission. You're just out there. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Free. But if you're asleep to
01:25:54.08 --> 01:25:59.04 private, well, a lot of times, you're not, you know, good to know. But yeah, I do know what. I'm not
01:25:59.04 --> 01:26:05.84 100% on board with that. I'm just being straight up. Like there's, I mean, I read some things
01:26:05.84 --> 01:26:10.64 that say, you know, if you, if you've missed, if you haven't slept for 24 hours, it's the equivalent
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:18.96 of three, you're, you're legally drunk. I don't think so. Yeah. I don't think so. There's times,
01:26:19.60 --> 01:26:23.36 I'll tell you what's a good example. The early musters that we did when we were doing the musters,
01:26:23.36 --> 01:26:29.52 we were, we didn't, we didn't have a system down yet. And so we didn't know all the things that
01:26:29.52 --> 01:26:34.96 we're going to have to tackle. We were just, we just didn't prepare correctly. And so we,
01:26:34.96 --> 01:26:42.000 late for night would be up all night long. I think the worst muster as far as sleep goes was New York City.
01:26:43.20 --> 01:26:49.84 New York City, one of the nights, I think it was the first night. We had to sign whatever,
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:56.000 900 graduations certificates. It was 130 in the morning when we got started. P.T. by the way,
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.28 for us, starts at three. So we sat there, we signed them, we went to bed for now, we woke up.
01:27:03.28 --> 01:27:07.04 And next day, we're on stage the entire day. No stopping people,
01:27:07.04 --> 01:27:11.52 really questions at me. Oh, what about this? What about that? I'm crap, crap, crap, crap,
01:27:11.52 --> 01:27:19.28 now could I have done that if I was seven drinks drunk? Some people can. Well, and I guess,
01:27:19.28 --> 01:27:23.84 well, let me, let me rephrase that. Let's not compare it alcohol. Because we know function that you
01:27:23.84 --> 01:27:32.40 could pull it off. But to say that I was up there cognitively impaired. Right. I don't think it's,
01:27:32.40 --> 01:27:37.28 I don't think you could say that. Yeah. I don't think it's true. Yeah, I think the reality of it is that
01:27:37.28 --> 01:27:42.48 different people are different and it's going to affect people in different ways and generally speaking,
01:27:42.48 --> 01:27:46.72 you know, getting free adequate risk is better than not getting at the end of the day. There's no doubt.
01:27:46.72 --> 01:27:51.36 Generally we'll take it. We would love to get that big old sleep. Sure. That's great. But what I'm
01:27:51.36 --> 01:27:56.56 saying is people don't always get to sleep a lot and you still have to make critical decisions
01:27:56.56 --> 01:28:05.28 and you're mind just like your body can adapt to certain situations. When I'm doing something,
01:28:05.28 --> 01:28:09.04 I just met out of time. I don't know what's happening. I'm on my mind.
01:28:09.04 --> 01:28:15.76 Right. Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. The, okay. So there is, I'm not going to, I don't know the
01:28:15.76 --> 01:28:23.12 studies, but if you believe that you got enough sleep, it affects your capacity. So like,
01:28:24.08 --> 01:28:28.72 that almost suggests like, man, if you're just like, I'm going to beat you up through this
01:28:28.72 --> 01:28:33.44 hundred percent. Oh, yeah. And that's your attitude. That will help your cognitive capacity. Even if
01:28:33.44 --> 01:28:37.76 you didn't get that much sleep. And I think I've met more than anything where it's like,
01:28:38.88 --> 01:28:43.60 I don't mean you're no good to know about it when you're, you know, it's sleep-deprived. I'm saying
01:28:43.60 --> 01:28:49.36 it's a good attitude to have to make sure like your team or whatever isn't sleep-deprived. That's a
01:28:49.36 --> 01:28:55.28 good attitude to have, you know, but as an individual or team member, whatever, it's good to be able
01:28:55.28 --> 01:29:02.72 to function with it. It's been sleeping without. For sure. Yes. You do need to be able to sleep
01:29:02.72 --> 01:29:10.24 as preferred, but what I'm saying is it's not going to, you can step up and rise to the occasion.
01:29:10.24 --> 01:29:16.48 Look, I don't recommend it for sure. You want to be able to sleep. Yes. But I'm not
01:29:17.52 --> 01:29:23.28 drastically cognitively impaired at the moment, you know, where all of a sudden, wait a second,
01:29:23.28 --> 01:29:28.48 you know, I don't know what they answered that question is, hold on, you know, that doesn't happen.
01:29:28.48 --> 01:29:34.16 It doesn't happen. You're adrenaline flows, you're up there, you're, you pull the trigger on
01:29:34.16 --> 01:29:40.08 your gun, whatever. Things are happening, you get in the game, you get in the game, you know,
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:49.20 you know, falling apart. No, you're making things happen. Even, you come to the mustard that
01:29:49.20 --> 01:29:54.80 you operate on very little sleep at the mustard, especially the early ones. Yeah. I see you,
01:29:54.80 --> 01:30:01.60 you know, hey, I forgot to press record. Well, you know what I'm saying? Maybe haven't been
01:30:01.60 --> 01:30:08.40 paying attention as much as you could of that case. Check. All right, continuing on, I do not mean
01:30:08.40 --> 01:30:13.36 to infer that there is always just one solution to a problem. Usually, there is one best solution,
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:19.60 but any good plan, bowl the executed is better than indecision. There is more, there's usually
01:30:19.60 --> 01:30:23.92 more than one way to obtain results. And the most important thing about that little section right
01:30:23.92 --> 01:30:28.96 here, look, we know that's the same thing Pat and says, any good plan, bowl the execution is
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:33.76 better than indecision or a good bowl is Pat and say a good plan executed now is better than a
01:30:33.76 --> 01:30:39.60 great plan executed next week. Saying the same thing, there's usually more than one way to obtain
01:30:39.60 --> 01:30:46.40 results. I like that. I want to focus on that because again, I'm not arguing with you about
01:30:46.40 --> 01:30:51.60 six and one half dozen the other. I'm not arguing with you about chewy-bring six vehicles or five
01:30:51.60 --> 01:30:59.68 vehicles. I'm not arguing with you if we should invest, you know, $800,000 in this market or
01:30:59.68 --> 01:31:05.52 $740,000 in this market. I'm not arguing with those things. What's the outcome going to be?
01:31:05.52 --> 01:31:08.96 They're going to be pretty close. There's more than one way to get a cat. Cool, let's go. Let's
01:31:08.96 --> 01:31:15.28 rock and roll. And by the way, when you come up with a plan and I go, you know what echo,
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:22.000 let's do it. Let's do what you say. And we start going down that road. It's not like we're stuck there. And I go,
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.84 hey echo, it looks like your plan might not be working out that great. Let's make an adjustment. You go,
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:31.52 cool. Sounds good. And by the way, you're more open to hearing my suggestions if I was originally
01:31:31.52 --> 01:31:37.36 open to your suggestions in the first place. I built a relationship there. We're going to multiple fronts.
01:31:40.32 --> 01:31:44.96 Continuing on, another quality of leadership that comes to mind is self-confidence. You must have
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:51.28 confidence in yourself. You're unit and your subordinate commanders and in your plan. This
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:56.56 recalls a couple of incidents just before the invasion of Normandy, 1944. Story went around
01:31:56.56 --> 01:32:00.80 in some of the units that were making the assault on the beaches that they would suffer 100
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:05.84 percent casualties that none of them would come back. I found a necessary to visit these units
01:32:05.84 --> 01:32:10.72 and talk to all ranks. I told them that of course we would suffer casualties, but certainly our
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:16.56 losses would be less would not be 100 percent. And that with our air and naval support, we would succeed.
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:22.64 After our landing, a correspondent told me that on his way across the channel in one of the leading
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:28.24 LSTs, he had a notice they sergeant reading a novel struck by this seeming lack of concern
01:32:28.24 --> 01:32:32.88 by the sergeant. He said, he asked aren't you worried? How can you be reading a time like this?
01:32:32.88 --> 01:32:37.52 The sergeant replied, no, I'm not worried. General Bradley said everything would go all right.
01:32:37.52 --> 01:32:45.12 So why should I worry? I can't recall just what I had said, but it accomplished its purpose,
01:32:45.12 --> 01:32:50.48 at least where one man was concerned. I might relate another incident where there was a lack
01:32:50.48 --> 01:32:55.68 of confidence. I had to relieve a senior commander because I learned that his men had lost confidence
01:32:55.68 --> 01:33:01.84 in him. This meant of course that we would not expect maximum performance by that division.
01:33:01.84 --> 01:33:06.72 After being relieved, the officer came back through my headquarters and showed me a file of
01:33:06.72 --> 01:33:11.84 statements given to him by request. I am sure by the burgo master of all the towns his
01:33:11.84 --> 01:33:18.08 division had passed through. If he had confidence in himself, he would not have felt the need
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:22.96 for all those letters. That's a cool little story. So he fires this division commander and the
01:33:22.96 --> 01:33:27.20 division commander comes out and says, listen, I haven't been doing a bad job. Here's the mayors
01:33:27.20 --> 01:33:31.12 of all the cities that we've been through. Here's they told me I did a good job. Here, look at
01:33:31.12 --> 01:33:35.84 the letters. And he's like, and he actually goes on. After seeing the letters, I told the officer
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:41.92 that if I ever had any doubts as to whether to relieve him, those doubts were now removed. His
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:46.88 letters proved beyond question that he had lost confidence in himself. So it was no wonder
01:33:46.88 --> 01:33:56.08 that the man had lost confidence in him. So definitely confidence is important. The interesting
01:33:56.08 --> 01:34:10.32 thing is humility, which is chapter two in extreme ownership, Czechyrigo, became an army value in
01:34:10.32 --> 01:34:21.68 2019, which is awesome. But I also, he talks about confidence. That's what he talks about. He
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:25.60 never league explorers. What happens when you get overconfident, right? And we all know that you
01:34:25.60 --> 01:34:33.84 can get overconfident and you can lose. So that's why humility is important. He says here,
01:34:33.84 --> 01:34:39.44 next characteristic, a leader must possess imagination, whether it be an administrative decision
01:34:39.44 --> 01:34:45.20 or one-made in combat. The possible results of that decision must be plain to the one making it.
01:34:45.20 --> 01:34:51.04 What will the next step be and the one after that? That's all he gives to imagination. That's
01:34:51.04 --> 01:34:56.80 all he gives to creativity. Need a little bit more. While there are many other qualities which can
01:34:56.80 --> 01:35:00.96 contribute to effective leadership, I will mention just one more, but it is a very important one
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:08.24 character. This word has many meanings. I am applying it in a broad sense to describe a person who
01:35:08.24 --> 01:35:16.000 has high ideals who stands by them and who can be absolutely trusted. Such a person will be respected
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.80 by all those with whom he is associated. And such a person will readily be recognized by his associates
01:35:22.80 --> 01:35:31.84 for what he is. Circumstances mold our character. These circumstances affect different people in
01:35:31.84 --> 01:35:39.44 different ways. From exactly the same set of circumstances, one man may theoretically build a palace,
01:35:39.44 --> 01:35:48.64 while another may have difficulty building a lean to. A lean to. It's a little hot.
01:35:49.52 --> 01:35:58.08 Little meat, the roof leans up against a stick. Put some, put some leaves on top of it to keep you dry.
01:35:58.80 --> 01:36:05.04 That's called a lean to. So from the same experiences, one person builds a palace, the other
01:36:05.04 --> 01:36:11.44 person builds a lean to. That's a rough one to take. It's a rough one to take because you might look
01:36:11.44 --> 01:36:17.84 around and say, well, you know, I know of the right circumstances in my life to be successful.
01:36:18.56 --> 01:36:24.16 I promise you that there's someone with worse circumstances, that's more successful than you. Promise
01:36:24.16 --> 01:36:37.36 you promise you. I believe this. It has been said that a man's character is the reality of
01:36:37.36 --> 01:36:41.92 himself. I don't think a man's strength of character ever changes. I remember a long time ago
01:36:41.92 --> 01:36:47.44 when somebody told me that a mountain's mountain might be reported to have moved. I could believe it
01:36:47.44 --> 01:36:52.16 or disbelieve it as I wished. But if anyone told me that a man had changed his character,
01:36:52.16 --> 01:37:01.12 I should not believe it. I don't know. Look, I think it's hard for people's characters to change.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.60 I don't think you can change someone's character very easily, actively, proactively make their
01:37:07.60 --> 01:37:12.32 character change. But I think that through life and through experience, people's character does
01:37:12.32 --> 01:37:19.36 absolutely change. And you can meet someone now that you knew 10 years ago and you'd say, whoa,
01:37:19.36 --> 01:37:24.48 that person's a whole new character and you would mean character. And it's classic sense.
01:37:25.04 --> 01:37:35.84 Yeah, I mean, what is character do you think? What just kind of moral, like your fiber,
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:40.72 you know, it's not because it's not like you can talk to pretty much anyone and they'd probably tell
01:37:40.72 --> 01:37:44.96 you, yeah, like I'm a different person than I was 15 years ago. Pretty much everyone would be like,
01:37:44.96 --> 01:37:48.48 okay, that wouldn't be a big surprise or whatever, but they're not talking about that, right?
01:37:48.48 --> 01:37:52.56 Like, character is different. Well, they are talking about that. What he's saying is that,
01:37:53.36 --> 01:37:58.56 you know, that slimy guy that you knew in high school that was trying to screw people over and
01:37:58.56 --> 01:38:02.80 whatever, he's saying like, that guy when you meet him 20 years later, guess what he's doing,
01:38:02.80 --> 01:38:08.88 still a slimy guy. One's doing another thing. I disagree with that. I actually have known
01:38:08.88 --> 01:38:15.36 people whose character has changed. And for me, I mean, there's a, we could do a whole show, I guess
01:38:15.36 --> 01:38:19.04 about what is character, but like for me, character is doing what you're, you know, you're supposed to
01:38:19.04 --> 01:38:24.08 do. Like actually doing what you know you're supposed to do, doing what you know is the right thing to
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:29.36 do. Yeah. That's, that's how you end up with character, right? You say you're going to do something
01:38:29.36 --> 01:38:33.84 you do it. You know you're supposed to do behave a certain way regardless of anyone's watching,
01:38:33.84 --> 01:38:38.32 regardless of the outcome. You know you're supposed to do the right thing you do at that's character.
01:38:38.32 --> 01:38:46.80 Yeah. I agree with you. I think that you can, it's a rare thing. I do kind of agree with him.
01:38:46.80 --> 01:38:51.84 Is it rare thing? It's a rare thing. There's something to be good. I remember that greasy dude,
01:38:52.56 --> 01:38:57.52 just being all trying to, you know, get won, take care of himself. Right. And you look at that
01:38:57.52 --> 01:39:02.40 person 10 years later. It's the same dude. But occasionally, you know, it's someone that changes.
01:39:02.40 --> 01:39:08.000 Yeah, like through maybe some big impactful event or maybe even just like a new
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.20 influence in life and like a little revelation kind of thing like, but you can, yeah, yeah, that
01:39:13.20 --> 01:39:18.64 can happen. I think, and I think it kind of does happen on these teeny tiny ways, but nothing that would
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:24.40 kind of collectively be considered character, you know, but I think yeah, I think why have people
01:39:24.40 --> 01:39:32.08 can? Yeah, I absolutely think they can. I think it, yeah, and I've seen it. I've seen it. I know
01:39:32.08 --> 01:39:38.80 people where I, you know, used to look at him and go, you, and now I look at him totally solid. Yeah.
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:43.36 I mean, I don't know how much my character's changed, but I've had absolutely, I had it
01:39:43.36 --> 01:39:51.68 has changed. I'm a different guy than I was when I was 22. Yeah, maybe in the, in the, on the
01:39:51.68 --> 01:39:56.96 battlefield, maybe it's more rare, you know, like to the point where he's writing straight up,
01:39:56.96 --> 01:40:05.60 it can't be changed. Yeah, it's, it's strange that he's so, I mean, saying it's more believe that
01:40:05.60 --> 01:40:10.96 a mountain move than someone's character move. That's a really both thing. And look, I got plenty
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:17.44 of examples where I know someone when they were, you know, 15 and then 20 and then 25 and 30 and it's
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:24.96 the same guy, the whole time. Sometimes it's a person's just as upstanding in their character,
01:40:24.96 --> 01:40:30.16 the whole time. And sometimes it's, they go, or sometimes they're just a scumbag from day one
01:40:30.16 --> 01:40:35.92 and you're like, yeah, no, that's didn't expect much less than that. And then there's some people
01:40:35.92 --> 01:40:41.84 that progress. And there's some people that that regress, right? Some people get treated bad,
01:40:41.84 --> 01:40:47.68 they go through and their character goes down. Yeah. So I think we're in mutual disagreement with
01:40:47.68 --> 01:40:53.76 general Omar Bradley on this point. I think people's character can absolutely improve. And I think
01:40:53.76 --> 01:41:00.16 I think it can get worse as well. You know, somebody gets, what's that burned? Yeah. Right,
01:41:00.16 --> 01:41:06.56 you get burned by someone. You get burned by a girl. You get burned by one of your friends.
01:41:06.56 --> 01:41:11.92 That'll change your character. Yeah. Kind of the same deal, right? Some big, like, revelation,
01:41:11.92 --> 01:41:16.88 you know, or some big impactful event, or the wrong influence over time. Like,
01:41:16.88 --> 01:41:20.88 just over time and time, I'm telling you know, you start hanging around with wrong people,
01:41:20.88 --> 01:41:25.20 getting to drugs or something like this, you know, or it's kind of like, man, my whole life is like,
01:41:25.20 --> 01:41:29.52 if you don't lie and cheat and steal, you kind of don't live, you know, you kind of don't survive,
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:33.52 kind of in this environment or something like that. Yeah, that one makes sense, do you? Yeah.
01:41:36.72 --> 01:41:42.64 Check all, he's wrapped that's the last characterist that he talks about. All leaders must
01:41:42.64 --> 01:41:47.04 possess these qualities which I have been discussing. And the great leaders are those who
01:41:47.04 --> 01:41:53.44 protect possess one or more of them to an outstanding degree. Some leaders just miss being great
01:41:53.44 --> 01:41:58.56 because they are weak in one or more of these areas. There's still another ingredient in this
01:41:58.56 --> 01:42:07.68 formula for a great leader that I have left out. And that is luck. All caps. He must have
01:42:07.68 --> 01:42:12.48 opportunity. Then of course, when opportunity knocks, he must be able to rise and open the door.
01:42:12.48 --> 01:42:22.80 Cool. I mean, look, yes, absolutely. I've been extremely lucky. I've seen people be extremely
01:42:22.80 --> 01:42:29.60 lucky. I've seen people being unlucky. So luck absolutely plays a role. I will say you make your own
01:42:29.60 --> 01:42:42.24 luck to an extent. Luck is a tough one. No one wants to, it's it's it's but it's a double
01:42:42.24 --> 01:42:48.56 edge sword, right? It's a double edge sword because you either, oh, that guy got lucky. Right.
01:42:48.56 --> 01:42:54.72 You didn't see how hard that guy works. Right. Or that guy got unlucky. You didn't see what
01:42:54.72 --> 01:43:00.80 that person did to end up in that unlucky spot. And both those things can flip. And they're both
01:43:00.80 --> 01:43:09.84 true. Yeah. So yeah, man. Yeah, it gets real complicated and luck thing. Yeah. I mean, I talk about
01:43:09.84 --> 01:43:14.64 in leadership strategy. So I talk about the the luck that I had in the seal things. All kinds of
01:43:14.64 --> 01:43:20.72 luck. Yeah. All kinds of luck for sure. Just the people I work with the deployments that I did,
01:43:20.72 --> 01:43:25.52 the situations that I was in. There's a lot of luck there. Some of that luck I manufactured.
01:43:26.24 --> 01:43:35.44 Some of it was just straight up all caps. No. But then it's like at the same time, you can be like,
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:40.96 well, even in a great result, like a scenario with a great result, you could have been even more
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:45.52 lucky. They're possible. You know, so it's like especially when you want to point your finger,
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:50.64 you know, and be like, then not point your finger. But when you want to put your finger on a certain
01:43:50.64 --> 01:43:54.80 result and be like, oh, this was lucky. Rather, it's just way more to it than that. Like,
01:43:54.80 --> 01:44:01.04 you can't, they're, they're better results that are that were possible. Yes. Right. So you just chose
01:44:01.04 --> 01:44:04.88 to point your finger at this very specific result and be like, this was lucky. And then, and then
01:44:04.88 --> 01:44:10.16 it's a spectrum. You could have been like one level less lucky and still had a great result,
01:44:10.16 --> 01:44:16.16 kind of thing. And then it goes down from there and it can go up from there too. So it's like,
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:22.96 to any time to label it luck as the thing. I mean, their extreme scenarios for sure. Oh, yeah,
01:44:22.96 --> 01:44:27.36 like you win the lottery. That's lucky. Yeah. You know, they're technically in the lot itself.
01:44:27.36 --> 01:44:32.80 It does play a role. Yeah. It's not the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's not the whole deal at all. And
01:44:32.80 --> 01:44:42.24 it's just like, it's like, if you, you get a, let's say this luck is a factor, but it is a smaller factor
01:44:42.24 --> 01:44:47.44 than most people give it credit for. Though, like you said, there are times where people just get
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:52.24 lucky. Oh, yeah. Massively lucky. And then you have to evaluate like what specific
01:44:52.24 --> 01:44:57.44 result are you talking about? Because if it's like, okay, this person has a 20 million dollars in
01:44:57.44 --> 01:45:05.92 is a bank in his bank account, that in and of itself is the result, right, of something, right?
01:45:05.92 --> 01:45:10.24 Now you can already evaluate, okay, was it hard work? And then with that hard work, it's like,
01:45:10.24 --> 01:45:14.16 okay, what luck is there luck in that hard work? Kind of thing? Or did they just win the lottery?
01:45:14.16 --> 01:45:18.96 Okay, that's a big lucky thing, kind of thing. But you're just talking about the 20 million
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:22.80 dollars in the account. You're not talking about his whole life. You're not talking about any of that.
01:45:22.80 --> 01:45:26.56 You're just talking about a very specific scenario. So that's why I think sometimes people get
01:45:26.56 --> 01:45:32.48 jammed up. And they'll evaluate this whole big resulting scenario. Not a specific element in it,
01:45:32.48 --> 01:45:38.000 a big resulting scenario. All of this person's whatever, you know, successful in this way,
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.24 right? And they're like, oh yeah, it's just, he just got lucky. But Brad, you're talking about
01:45:44.24 --> 01:45:49.52 that success has so many different elements in it. Good and bad, by the way. And then you just
01:45:49.52 --> 01:45:56.48 wrap up the whole thing and deliver a luck. Luckily, most likely a minor impact, but it is
01:45:56.48 --> 01:46:03.04 an impact and there are times when it's a significant impact. But yeah, it's like it's straight up or
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:07.76 most of the time, and when you hear it, it's straight up migrating every other factor. Oh,
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:14.72 people want to let people say, oh, that guy is lucky. For sure. For sure. When someone's trying to
01:46:14.72 --> 01:46:21.60 make excuses for themselves on why this person got this promotion and I didn't know they were lucky.
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:28.32 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there no luck involved? No, there's some luck involved, but let's not leave it to luck.
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.84 Continuing on, some may ask, why do you talk about the qualities of leadership?
01:46:34.96 --> 01:46:40.96 They maintain that you either have leadership or you don't, that leaders are born not made. I suppose
01:46:40.96 --> 01:46:45.68 some are born with a certain amount of leadership. Frequently, we see children who are
01:46:45.68 --> 01:46:51.76 who seem inclined to take charge and direct their playmates. The other youngsters follow these directions
01:46:51.76 --> 01:46:57.52 without protest, but I am convinced nevertheless that leadership can be developed and improved by
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:04.16 study and training. 100%. There's no better way to develop leadership than to give the
01:47:04.16 --> 01:47:11.04 youngster or other individual a job involving responsibility and let them try to work it out.
01:47:11.04 --> 01:47:18.32 Try to avoid telling them how to do it. You talk about youngsters. As you heard, as I talk
01:47:18.32 --> 01:47:24.000 about leadership strategy and tactics, this is a technique that's a technique to make people
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.60 better leaders, put them in leadership situations, give them responsibility, give them a job, give
01:47:27.60 --> 01:47:31.60 a task, something they can do, make them lead it, they lead it, their successful their confidence
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:37.04 goes up. Then he says, try avoiding how to telling them how to do it. Yeah, that's decentralized command.
01:47:37.04 --> 01:47:45.20 That, for example, is the basis for a whole system of combat orders. Yes. Combat orders, they're
01:47:45.20 --> 01:47:50.000 talking about something very specific. It is a way of delivering orders using commanders in
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.24 10 as opposed to telling you, here's the mission. Here's the people, here's the weapons,
01:47:54.24 --> 01:47:56.88 here's everything. Here's exactly what I want you to do and said you just give them the mission.
01:47:56.88 --> 01:48:02.40 You let them figure it out. They call that combat orders. Well, tell the subordinate,
01:48:02.40 --> 01:48:07.76 we tell the subordinate commander what we want him to do and leave him to the details.
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:12.88 I think this system is largely responsible for the many fine leaders in our services today.
01:48:12.88 --> 01:48:16.72 We are constantly training and developing younger officers and teaching them how to accept
01:48:16.72 --> 01:48:22.64 responsibility. However, don't discount experience. Someone may remind you that Napoleon
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:28.96 led armies before he was 30 and Alexander the great died at the age of 33. Napoleon as he grew
01:48:28.96 --> 01:48:34.40 older, commanded even larger armies. Alexander might have been even greater, had he lived longer
01:48:34.40 --> 01:48:42.64 and had more experience. In this respect, I like, I especially like general buckner's theory,
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:48.24 that judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment.
01:48:51.36 --> 01:48:56.48 And he wraps it up here. I've been asked to speak on leadership in the past. I have fairly well-covered
01:48:56.48 --> 01:49:04.88 these same thoughts with other groups. Somehow, however, at the moment, these thoughts take on added
01:49:04.88 --> 01:49:11.76 significance for me. You see, my first great grandson was born a year ago. We call him FAT Henry.
01:49:12.88 --> 01:49:19.12 What happens to his life? Into the lives of his contemporaries may well be in your hands.
01:49:19.12 --> 01:49:31.76 Thank you. So, it's a poignant kind of way to wrap it up. The fact that the
01:49:34.08 --> 01:49:40.72 leaders right now that are listening to this, the leaders that are learning, the leaders that are
01:49:40.72 --> 01:49:48.96 reading, they will end up running the world. And they will end up running it well and making it
01:49:48.96 --> 01:50:04.000 better or running it bad than making it worse for FAT Henry. So, interesting, interesting. I'm sure
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:14.48 we'll get to his book at some point, but so much about leadership. So many things, you know, that we hit
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:22.24 we cover, we see it from a different angle, makes you better, makes me better. It makes me better every time
01:50:22.24 --> 01:50:33.68 I get to the opportunity to think through these things. And, of course, the best way to train leaders
01:50:34.56 --> 01:50:38.32 is to make sure that we are being good leaders ourselves. We're setting a good example.
01:50:39.44 --> 01:50:49.60 The best example that we can staying on the path, you might say. So, since we are looking to stay
01:50:49.60 --> 01:50:56.88 on the path, anything you recommend echo Charles for that conduct. Well, we do want to keep ourselves
01:50:56.88 --> 01:51:04.72 capable, improve the skills, increase the skills one skill being, due to it's important skill.
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:12.24 To increase and maintain our capability, due to it's one of them, keep working out,
01:51:12.24 --> 01:51:20.56 if you're not working out, work out. The weak body is an incapable body. In a matter of speaking.
01:51:21.20 --> 01:51:26.32 Kind of. That is true. You definitely want to be as strong as you can, different for everybody.
01:51:26.32 --> 01:51:33.36 Yes, realistic. Body. Be the best shape that you can be in. That's good advice.
01:51:33.36 --> 01:51:40.56 Can't really be denied. Can't be. So, when we're doing GJT, we need a G, we need a Rashcards,
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:48.000 get an origin G, because they're the best 100% factually. So, in America. In America.
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.08 You know, okay, we blown that off now. Made America's not a big deal anymore. Oh, no, no, no, no.
01:51:52.08 --> 01:51:56.40 Or is made America bigger deal than ever. I think you've got an American supply chain.
01:51:56.40 --> 01:51:59.20 Yes, that what's going on? Oh, yeah. So, what? Right. Just making sure.
01:51:59.20 --> 01:52:03.60 We're seeing to me, like you were just getting ready to move on. Well, without saying made to make it.
01:52:03.60 --> 01:52:11.92 Okay, yeah, I understand your feedback. Thank you. Made America is a big deal. Huge deal.
01:52:11.92 --> 01:52:17.60 It was a big deal prior to the virus. Yep. Now it's an even bigger deal.
01:52:17.60 --> 01:52:22.40 American supply chain. We're not begging and pleading for stuff to get shipped overseas.
01:52:22.40 --> 01:52:29.04 We have it. It's made in America. All of it. Yes, sir. So. And by the way, it's not just GJT,
01:52:29.04 --> 01:52:35.52 you either. Gines. You probably need genes. Yes, sir. Oh, it is everyone in the world.
01:52:35.52 --> 01:52:40.88 The entire world where genes. Yes. Every single person in the entire world needs genes has genes.
01:52:41.92 --> 01:52:45.92 Why not get genes that are made in America? Why not get the best and most comfortable genes ever made?
01:52:46.80 --> 01:52:54.40 That's my question. Yeah, no reason why not. So, go to origin, main, the state main.
01:52:54.40 --> 01:52:59.52 Origin main.com is where you can get all this stuff. Okay. So all this stuff that I'm talking about like
01:52:59.52 --> 01:53:08.000 Jocquip. So, I look, when we put it is made in America. From the beginnings of the materials
01:53:08.88 --> 01:53:15.92 because one thing to be like, hey, yeah, I, you know, switch the tag out here up in, you know,
01:53:15.92 --> 01:53:20.88 one beach and so it's made here technically, you know, the end-hey look, known the matter. That's
01:53:20.88 --> 01:53:24.96 cool, but some people are mad. Well, some people are here serving you right. I wrong. All right.
01:53:25.84 --> 01:53:32.72 Stand corrected for sure, but on the fiber, the cotton is grown in America. That is made in America.
01:53:32.72 --> 01:53:40.16 So, these things are made in America. So, like we said, geese, fresh carts, genes, American denim,
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.68 other things, joggers, sweat suits, various apparel clothing items, boots.
01:53:47.68 --> 01:53:58.08 So, origin boots have like a more of like a, I don't want to say mystique, but you know, when
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:03.20 you're like, when you kind of see the origin boots, they kind of have a gravitas to them.
01:54:03.20 --> 01:54:08.16 Yeah. More so then there's a little something about them. Yeah. Uh, you know how,
01:54:08.80 --> 01:54:14.48 Omar Bradley said that some people don't have it. Yeah. But we could say that certain items in the
01:54:14.48 --> 01:54:20.80 world also have it. I would say that origin boots have it. That is the perfect way to put it. Yes.
01:54:20.80 --> 01:54:27.36 Yes, sir. So, get some boots with it. Yes. Also, jockel fuel. Okay. So, I was talking about
01:54:27.36 --> 01:54:31.84 staying healthy, staying capable, all this stuff like in the hey man supplementation is
01:54:32.72 --> 01:54:38.88 part of that, that whole deal. So, important. Very important. You won't know how important it is
01:54:38.88 --> 01:54:44.72 until you joint start giving up. You joint start quitting work out, you know, when your elbows are all sore,
01:54:44.72 --> 01:54:49.76 when you're trying to, you know, get under the bench and stuff. Yeah. Just getting to know good.
01:54:49.76 --> 01:54:57.04 Joint warfare, acrylic oil, super acrylic oil, discipline and discipline go. We got the ready to drink
01:54:57.04 --> 01:55:02.32 hot with you drinking lemon lime today. Yeah. You know, I had citrus psycho. Yeah. I had the
01:55:02.32 --> 01:55:12.40 tropical thunder one earlier. You're too deep, huh? Yes, sir. Check. Mulk, by the way, if you're a human
01:55:13.52 --> 01:55:20.32 and let's say you, you are doing any kind of activity, you need protein. Yes. Might as well get
01:55:20.32 --> 01:55:27.28 protein that is clean and that just straight up tastes like dessert. Yeah. Dave Burke. Good
01:55:27.28 --> 01:55:34.08 you'll do. Yeah. Worried that maybe it was a weakness. Yes. At night to have a strawberry mulk.
01:55:34.08 --> 01:55:40.80 Man, that was a very technical scenario. It was talking about. So, I can see it's a week, you know what?
01:55:40.80 --> 01:55:45.60 I evaluated it. It's like back into the whole thing where you used to be like, hey, jocco,
01:55:45.60 --> 01:55:52.32 if you're so into the way your supplements taste, maybe that's a weakness. Right. It's kind of the same
01:55:52.32 --> 01:55:58.08 thing. Yeah. The same thing. Concept. Yes. I thought I still think you're wrong. Well, at the end of the day,
01:55:58.08 --> 01:56:03.76 if you're results driven, oh, yeah, it's like weakness. No, I, you won't be able to recognize any
01:56:03.76 --> 01:56:07.68 weakness in the scenario. So let it go, because at the end of the day, you win 100% you're
01:56:07.68 --> 01:56:16.16 correct about that. Sure. But if we want to go tech, you're in tension is something. You see them
01:56:16.16 --> 01:56:22.56 same. Yeah. I want the discipline that you're doing. It's good. Yeah. Dave, look, this is a thing that we need
01:56:22.56 --> 01:56:30.80 to just continue trying to clarify for everyone. If you have a mulk late at night, you're not that
01:56:30.80 --> 01:56:37.68 hungry, but you want to taste something delicious. So you mix one up. It's 11 o'clock at night. Let's face it.
01:56:38.80 --> 01:56:45.12 That's a questionable activity. But at the same time, you're literally providing your, your body
01:56:45.12 --> 01:56:51.36 with the fuel that it needs to be strong. So it's, it's, it's a real thing. This is a real,
01:56:51.36 --> 01:56:58.24 this is a real win. So I'm calling it a win. Yes, sir. I agree. So yeah, get on that. Get on that.
01:56:58.24 --> 01:57:05.36 We need to do it. Do we do I need to make a mulk mulk that tastes like crap, right? Just for the
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:11.12 mental discipline. Just to get a double dose of discipline, you'll get strong and you'll get
01:57:11.12 --> 01:57:16.64 mentally tougher because you'll be drinking something that tastes like caracene. Yeah. No, don't do that.
01:57:16.64 --> 01:57:22.64 Don't do that. Please check. So anyway, yes, mulk protein. And there's a form of a dessert all for it.
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:30.48 100%. Jocquawaited. Also, you want something a little bit lighter, organic refreshing if you drink it as
01:57:30.48 --> 01:57:34.64 iced tea. The thing that people really like about Jocquawaited is that it allows you to bet two dead
01:57:34.64 --> 01:57:42.08 lift 8,000 pounds. Yes, and that by the way, that's double blind placebo tested with a 94 person
01:57:42.08 --> 01:57:51.44 control group. Yeah, so get that. And all these supplement items can be found at the vitamin shop.

01:59:04.24 --> 01:59:08.48 What is the bone of feedies? Do you know what the technical bone of feedies was in the military?
01:59:08.48 --> 01:59:13.36 It's like the cheesy thing where someone says it's a nice night for a walk.
01:59:13.36 --> 01:59:18.88 And the other person says, but it's cold in Nebraska. So it's a little, like I would say to you,
01:59:18.88 --> 01:59:22.64 it's a nice night for a walk. And you would say, but it's cold in Nebraska. Then I go, okay, cool.
01:59:23.28 --> 01:59:30.16 Hey, years, it's going on. You know what I thought it was? What? I thought it was nice night for a walk.
01:59:30.16 --> 01:59:36.000 A and the other person says nice night for a walk. Then you say, wash data,
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.08 moral, nothing clean, right? Then the other person says nothing clean, right?
01:59:43.60 --> 01:59:47.68 What is that from? Terminator. Oh, okay. Anyway. So yes,
01:59:47.68 --> 01:59:51.52 both of feedies all day. If I see you, I'm going to give you the same deal. I may say,
01:59:51.52 --> 01:59:56.16 nice and far more. My knowledge comes from 20 years of serving the nation in the military.
01:59:56.16 --> 02:00:00.64 The knowledge comes from Terminator too. Well, that was Terminator one, but yes, Terminator too,
02:00:00.64 --> 02:00:05.20 as well. That is inches. So I guess basically we both have the same knowledge. Yes, same thing.
02:00:05.20 --> 02:00:12.80 Same thing. I like it. Yes. And also subscribe if you haven't already on all the podcasting places,
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:18.48 where have you listed a podcast subscribe? You know, it's a thing. It's cool. Yes, speaking of this podcast,
02:00:18.48 --> 02:00:23.76 we also have other podcasts. Wonderful. We're having some technical difficulties right now. We had
02:00:23.76 --> 02:00:30.16 a podcast that was previously called the thread. There's already an existing podcast called the thread,
02:00:30.16 --> 02:00:35.92 which I didn't know about because I just didn't really pay attention to it. And so we're changing
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:40.72 the name of ours. Just don't know what it's going to be called yet. We'll put it up there shortly. So if you
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:44.64 missing the thread, that's where it's at. It's gone for now. It'll be back. We'll put up all the
02:00:44.64 --> 02:00:50.56 episodes. We'll change whatever we're going to change so that it's differentiated from that. My my boss
02:00:50.96 --> 02:00:57.28 oops. Yeah. The weird thing is there's all kinds of podcasts called the thread or some variant of that.
02:00:58.32 --> 02:01:06.08 But ours, I think our our retailers was more popular. So they didn't like that. And I don't want
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:10.64 people to be confused. No, it'll eliminate confusion for sure. We also have the grounded podcast,
02:01:11.92 --> 02:01:19.04 the warrior kid podcast and speaking of warrior kids, we got warrior kids so from iris ocheranish.com.
02:01:19.04 --> 02:01:23.36 Is that stuff? Is killer soap alive on the jocquist orient?
02:01:27.36 --> 02:01:31.76 Yes. You keep giving weird answers. Well, you know, there's a thing. There's the,
02:01:31.76 --> 02:01:38.96 you know, be on the lookout for that. All right. So if not, go to irisotrans.com and get some soap,
02:01:38.96 --> 02:01:44.48 some killer soap so that you and your family can stay clean.
02:01:44.48 --> 02:01:51.84 You stay clean. Also, we have a YouTube channel for the video of this podcast plus excerpts.
02:01:51.84 --> 02:01:58.24 And the witches are big deal. So, you know, you want to listen to a cool concept that may have been,
02:01:58.24 --> 02:02:02.08 you know, in one of the episodes that you kind of remember, it'll be as as an excerpt so you can,
02:02:02.08 --> 02:02:06.48 you know, you can watch that. Maybe share it with somebody if you want. But in the last YouTube channel,
02:02:06.48 --> 02:02:12.56 yes, we do have YouTube channels. So you said it out. I totally, I've got that checkmark. Did they send you
02:02:12.56 --> 02:02:18.56 something to contact you to tell you you're official now? Um, well, we had some help by some
02:02:18.56 --> 02:02:25.28 very capable people. And yeah, they let us know. They were official. Did you feel kind of good about
02:02:25.28 --> 02:02:29.84 that really kind of like you're the man? Yes, sir. Let's still do. I feel like we have an official
02:02:29.84 --> 02:02:33.92 YouTube channel. That's good. Well, we do fact better than being unofficial. I'm just sure.

02:06:53.20 --> 02:06:58.32 remember what he taught us. He taught us a lot. And let's think about this. He taught us that there are
02:06:58.32 --> 02:07:06.64 many solutions to a problem. But any good plan executed boldly is better than indecision.
02:07:06.64 --> 02:07:31.68 And so don't hesitate instead pick a plan and get after it. Until next time, this is Eko and Joko.
