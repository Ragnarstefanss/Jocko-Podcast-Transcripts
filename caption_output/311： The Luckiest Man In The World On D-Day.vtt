00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.28
This is Jockel Podcast number 311.

2
00:00:03.28 --> 00:00:07.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel will in good evening, echo evening.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
June 6, 1944.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.60
D-Day.

5
00:00:15.60 --> 00:00:20.68
The largest C-born invasion in history.

6
00:00:20.68 --> 00:00:29.04
Almost 7,000 ships and landing vessels almost 200,000 naval personnel and 150,000 ground

7
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:40.64
troops, attacking the heavily fortified beaches of the Nazis at Lannick Wall in France.

8
00:00:40.64 --> 00:00:53.04
In doing so, Allied forces suffered over 10,000 casualties, including 4,414 killed in action.

9
00:00:53.04 --> 00:01:01.04
It was a brutal assault, but the beachhead was secured.

10
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:05.80
However, the fighting was not over far from it.

11
00:01:05.80 --> 00:01:11.80
There was much fighting to be done.

12
00:01:11.80 --> 00:01:18.72
The fight through the Villars' Bokaj, the assault on the city of Kane and Sherborg, the battle

13
00:01:18.72 --> 00:01:25.04
to seize the village of St. Lowe, the fight to close the Phaelas, gap the liberation of Paris,

14
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:33.68
the advance to the Rhine, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of R. Nemm, that was

15
00:01:33.68 --> 00:01:42.44
at more brews, overloon, the hurt can forest and all the way to the Battle of the Bulge

16
00:01:42.44 --> 00:01:46.60
in the Rden's forest.

17
00:01:46.60 --> 00:01:52.32
The Battle of the Bulge, the largest battle fought by Americans in World War II, December

18
00:01:52.32 --> 00:02:03.32
1944 through January 1945, included a million Allied troops, 500,000 Americans resulted

19
00:02:03.32 --> 00:02:14.16
in more than 47,000 wounded, over 23,000 missing, and 19,000 killed in action.

20
00:02:14.16 --> 00:02:21.000
In the Battle of the Bulge, once again, victory was achieved.

21
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.36
Eventually, victory in Europe was achieved and then Japan, and that victory was achieved

22
00:02:27.36 --> 00:02:32.72
by what is now known as the greatest generation.

23
00:02:32.72 --> 00:02:42.44
It is an absolute honor for us to have one of those men here with us, a man that landed

24
00:02:42.44 --> 00:02:48.64
on the D-Day and fought all the way to the Battle of the Bulge.

25
00:02:48.64 --> 00:02:55.44
His name is Mr. Jake Larson, also known as Papa Jake, and he is here with us, sir.

26
00:02:55.44 --> 00:02:56.44
Thank you for coming.

27
00:02:56.44 --> 00:02:58.04
It is an honor to have you here.

28
00:02:58.04 --> 00:03:01.44
Well, it's a honor to be here.

29
00:03:01.44 --> 00:03:05.44
Thank you very much for the introduction.

30
00:03:05.44 --> 00:03:14.72
I don't think I'm any special, but I've all the people I was with.

31
00:03:14.72 --> 00:03:27.72
I started at a young age when I was 15, I joined the National Card, and I was in

32
00:03:27.72 --> 00:03:37.72
the K-Playboard and Louisiana for a year when Japanese hit Pearl Harbor.

33
00:03:37.72 --> 00:03:48.96
So I go back a few years, and as I look back, every person that I was with in three different

34
00:03:48.96 --> 00:03:59.28
units, company F, 135th Infantry Regiment, company H, or headquarters company, 135th Infantry

35
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:11.12
Regiment, and fifth core, every person I was with is gone.

36
00:04:11.12 --> 00:04:13.32
Why I'm here now?

37
00:04:13.32 --> 00:04:20.32
In a few days, I'm going to be 99 years old.

38
00:04:20.32 --> 00:04:28.44
99 years, I can't believe it myself.

39
00:04:28.44 --> 00:04:33.64
I don't have aches and pains like other people have.

40
00:04:33.64 --> 00:04:39.08
No arthritis, no stiff thing.

41
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:43.56
I get up out of bed, I'm white awake.

42
00:04:43.56 --> 00:04:46.92
It's crazy.

43
00:04:46.92 --> 00:04:55.24
I think my life is governed from above, and I think those up there, who are doing this

44
00:04:55.24 --> 00:04:59.36
to me, or sitting with me right now.

45
00:04:59.36 --> 00:05:04.40
I think them for helping me.

46
00:05:04.40 --> 00:05:10.000
You said you don't think you're anything special, which I guess we could argue with

47
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.56
that point, but I'm not here to argue with you, sir.

48
00:05:12.56 --> 00:05:18.000
However, you have to admit that you are lucky, and in fact, you did admit it, you have

49
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.60
a book that you wrote, which is called the luckiest man in the world, and I think you're

50
00:05:23.60 --> 00:05:27.28
definitely in the running for it.

51
00:05:27.28 --> 00:05:34.76
Well, I appreciate that, but you have to read the book.

52
00:05:34.76 --> 00:05:45.28
I can't sit here and start telling you how lucky I am, but even before the day, I'm

53
00:05:45.28 --> 00:05:59.04
not before the day.

54
00:05:59.04 --> 00:06:07.60
Firing every kind of weapon, because I came from the infantry.

55
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:17.32
I was down to lands and there was shooting 50 caliber, water cool machine guns at

56
00:06:17.32 --> 00:06:22.56
towed targets.

57
00:06:22.56 --> 00:06:32.44
Then British had this little exercise, I've slept in sands, and they were going to

58
00:06:32.44 --> 00:06:38.000
greet us with live fire.

59
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.40
Pretty interesting there.

60
00:06:41.40 --> 00:06:53.32
I was one chosen from G3 to go down there, a sergeant, and I was with others from the landing.

61
00:06:53.32 --> 00:07:02.08
There was 400 of us on this landing ship.

62
00:07:02.08 --> 00:07:06.44
This was, we'll get to that part of the story, but what you're talking about this exercise,

63
00:07:06.44 --> 00:07:07.44
it's slapped in sands.

64
00:07:07.44 --> 00:07:14.72
This was just a preparatory event to get ready for D-Day, and yet where you were doing

65
00:07:14.72 --> 00:07:16.84
this training, there was enemy there.

66
00:07:16.84 --> 00:07:18.48
There was enemy vessels.

67
00:07:18.48 --> 00:07:29.56
There was two e-boats, Germany boats came in there, and sank to those landing ship tanks,

68
00:07:29.56 --> 00:07:37.48
right along with the enemy, and shot up the armed guard on top of the one I was in, and

69
00:07:37.48 --> 00:07:39.88
we had no air.

70
00:07:39.88 --> 00:07:48.16
We were 400 of us laying there on the floor, suffering from diesel gas, and vomiting.

71
00:07:48.16 --> 00:08:00.70
I don't know how we made it back to Plymouth, England, but when we got to Plymouth, a

72
00:08:00.70 --> 00:08:06.60
full bird kernel came out, called us to attention, and swars to secrecy.

73
00:08:06.60 --> 00:08:13.000
We could not even discuss this when our superior officers were going to be at back.

74
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.40
And this, I didn't know anything about this or telling anyone about, for 40 years, 40

75
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:26.96
years that British brought it up.

76
00:08:26.96 --> 00:08:34.88
And people started calling me a liar because nothing like that ever happened.

77
00:08:34.88 --> 00:08:37.92
Well, I was there.

78
00:08:37.92 --> 00:08:52.04
It happened to me, and I found out that the 400 of those guys that had, there were 795

79
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:53.88
casualties there.

80
00:08:53.88 --> 00:09:09.60
400 was from the force infantry division, which were supposed to land alongside of us.

81
00:09:09.60 --> 00:09:14.84
On D-Day, it's unbelievable to think about now.

82
00:09:14.84 --> 00:09:17.16
No mention of these guys.

83
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:29.56
They were all buried over in England, and they were put out on the record as being lost.

84
00:09:29.56 --> 00:09:34.08
Coming to shore on D-Day.

85
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:35.08
Crazy.

86
00:09:35.08 --> 00:09:36.08
Crazy.

87
00:09:36.08 --> 00:09:44.28
That's one of the many stories you have in this book, and the book is a phenomenal book.

88
00:09:44.28 --> 00:09:51.76
I wanted to go back and talk about where you came from and read a little bit from the book.

89
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:55.68
And I'll skip around so everyone that's out there, you have to get the whole book.

90
00:09:55.68 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm only going to read some pieces of it today, but just wanted to talk to you about some

91
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.20
of the things you talk about in the book.

92
00:10:02.20 --> 00:10:08.16
You say here, in December 1922, how to huge effect on my life, because I was younger

93
00:10:08.16 --> 00:10:11.04
than most of my classmates who were born earlier in the year.

94
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:15.44
All this meant, however, was that I learned how to get things done.

95
00:10:15.44 --> 00:10:19.36
Now you grew up with seven brothers and sisters.

96
00:10:19.36 --> 00:10:25.36
You had Todd Earl, Evan Leo, Murrell, Eleanor, and Bobby.

97
00:10:25.36 --> 00:10:29.96
And you note in here, you say, I remember asking Leo how I was born.

98
00:10:29.96 --> 00:10:35.44
And he told me that a crow should on a fence post and the sun hatched me out.

99
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:40.04
Whenever I saw a crow, I wondered if it was the one responsible for my birth.

100
00:10:40.04 --> 00:10:45.76
I was going on a farm, I saw plenty of chickens hatched, so the story made sense to me.

101
00:10:45.76 --> 00:10:50.20
So I think your brother Leo had you fooled for a little while.

102
00:10:50.20 --> 00:10:52.80
Well, well, he was ten years old in me.

103
00:10:52.80 --> 00:11:05.04
And when you're five and somebody is 15, you look for somebody that is going to enlighten you.

104
00:11:05.04 --> 00:11:06.52
Indeed.

105
00:11:06.52 --> 00:11:10.28
So you, your parents started off on a homestead in South Dakota and you talk about that

106
00:11:10.28 --> 00:11:16.52
something here, but then eventually grandma Larson who lived in Hope, Minnesota wrote to my

107
00:11:16.52 --> 00:11:22.24
father and her husband's after her husband's death, asking if he could move to Hope

108
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:23.36
to run the farm.

109
00:11:23.36 --> 00:11:29.52
My parents packed their bags once again and moved to 240 acre farm, up birth, I got 80 acres

110
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:31.08
and we got the rest.

111
00:11:31.08 --> 00:11:35.32
The downstairs included the living room, along with Pa and Mother's Bedrooms and the

112
00:11:35.32 --> 00:11:41.20
kitchen, which had a wood stove equipped with burners and oven and a 30 gallon reservoir.

113
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:45.80
You say Pa's Bedroom was off the kitchen and mom's room was by the living room.

114
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:50.12
They didn't sleep in the same bed, but managed to have eight kids anyways.

115
00:11:50.12 --> 00:11:52.24
And then all the kids room for upstairs.

116
00:11:52.24 --> 00:11:56.08
Yeah, yes, yeah.

117
00:11:56.08 --> 00:12:00.24
And you went through, I know we're going through a pandemic right now, but you went through

118
00:12:00.24 --> 00:12:07.24
the or your parents began running the farm after the flu pandemic of 1918.

119
00:12:07.24 --> 00:12:19.52
And that took my only living ground parent after time, it was my grandmother, grandmother

120
00:12:19.52 --> 00:12:27.12
Larson, her husband, my grandfather died in his 40s.

121
00:12:27.12 --> 00:12:35.04
He came in, the city came in from the barn, complained that he had a pain in his stomach,

122
00:12:35.04 --> 00:12:41.68
sharp pain, and that's a lot of horse kicked him in the stomach.

123
00:12:41.68 --> 00:12:45.56
And I was a victim of a pericitis.

124
00:12:45.56 --> 00:12:53.80
My oldest brother was a bit, so it was a pericitis that killed him at broke.

125
00:12:53.80 --> 00:12:57.80
And I went through that same thing.

126
00:12:57.80 --> 00:13:03.36
So growing up on the farm, you say life on the farm was not easy.

127
00:13:03.36 --> 00:13:04.56
It was plain hard work.

128
00:13:04.56 --> 00:13:05.80
Every member of the family had chores.

129
00:13:05.80 --> 00:13:09.16
We get up at about six a.m. drink hot cocoa, then do chores.

130
00:13:09.16 --> 00:13:12.80
Like milking cows, caring feed for the cattle, cleaning the stalls, adding in the new

131
00:13:12.80 --> 00:13:16.92
straw, separating milk and cream, the milk went to the hogs and the cream went to the

132
00:13:16.92 --> 00:13:17.92
house.

133
00:13:17.92 --> 00:13:21.36
We poured cream into cans, dropping them into the well to keep them cool.

134
00:13:21.36 --> 00:13:25.92
We milked 32 cows by hand every morning and night.

135
00:13:25.92 --> 00:13:31.36
I was about six years old when I started milking cows.

136
00:13:31.36 --> 00:13:38.48
It's a crazy life, but we didn't think anything about it.

137
00:13:38.48 --> 00:13:40.60
It was our life.

138
00:13:40.60 --> 00:13:43.80
And the neighbors were living the same way we were.

139
00:13:43.80 --> 00:13:53.04
So it was pretty natural.

140
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:56.20
We didn't have a lot of extra money for good clothes.

141
00:13:56.20 --> 00:14:02.92
If I overhauled, it's got a whole in it from where or from a tear.

142
00:14:02.92 --> 00:14:09.56
My mother was an excellent seamstress and sewing machine operator.

143
00:14:09.56 --> 00:14:16.88
I had everything done with a pedal sewing machine.

144
00:14:16.88 --> 00:14:18.32
So you had all that going on.

145
00:14:18.32 --> 00:14:26.16
Plus you had turkeys, geese, pigs, horses, ducks, and you planted wheat and corn and barley

146
00:14:26.16 --> 00:14:33.16
and oats and alfalfan soybeans, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, turnups, everything going on.

147
00:14:33.16 --> 00:14:40.16
We lived out of fruit jars.

148
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:53.48
We lived out of fruit jars and they were picking tomatoes when my brother Bob climbed up

149
00:14:53.48 --> 00:14:59.84
on the windmill and maybe it could bring that up.

150
00:14:59.84 --> 00:15:04.96
Yeah, that's one of the crazy accidents that you saw when you were growing up.

151
00:15:04.96 --> 00:15:09.84
Before we get to that, you had a section in here and the section this chapter of the book

152
00:15:09.84 --> 00:15:13.40
is called Moon Shine.

153
00:15:13.40 --> 00:15:17.08
And you say, Paul made Moon Shine long before I was born.

154
00:15:17.08 --> 00:15:20.84
He was accommodating people who needed to drink, but had to seek other means of getting

155
00:15:20.84 --> 00:15:22.40
it due to prohibition.

156
00:15:22.40 --> 00:15:25.36
I helped bottle the Moon Shine when I was eight.

157
00:15:25.36 --> 00:15:29.68
It was double pure, pretty close to 200%.

158
00:15:29.68 --> 00:15:33.40
We used to still water to cut it down to 85% alcohol.

159
00:15:33.40 --> 00:15:39.76
You tell a story in here about the first time you got drunk, which was around age five.

160
00:15:39.76 --> 00:15:41.76
Coffee punch.

161
00:15:41.76 --> 00:15:43.76
Yes.

162
00:15:43.76 --> 00:15:44.76
And it's funny.

163
00:15:44.76 --> 00:15:49.04
We're chocquint about it now, but you say in here at one point it happened.

164
00:15:49.04 --> 00:15:52.88
One of Dad's so-called friend's turned him in.

165
00:15:52.88 --> 00:15:57.12
And he got six months in Austin City, jail for selling Moon Shine.

166
00:15:57.12 --> 00:16:01.44
So the original sentence was up to two years at Leavenworth Penitentiary.

167
00:16:01.44 --> 00:16:04.60
So your Dad ended up going into jail for a while.

168
00:16:04.60 --> 00:16:09.28
Six months, six months, so celebrate it.

169
00:16:09.28 --> 00:16:18.44
There are 25th wedding anniversary in Austin City, jail.

170
00:16:18.44 --> 00:16:27.04
And I remember on the way down there, we had a Jewat car sedan.

171
00:16:27.04 --> 00:16:29.88
My brother Leo was a driver.

172
00:16:29.88 --> 00:16:32.48
I was eight years old at that time.

173
00:16:32.48 --> 00:16:37.40
And my brother Leo was driving.

174
00:16:37.40 --> 00:16:41.04
My mother did not drive, but she was alongside.

175
00:16:41.04 --> 00:16:48.28
And she had a cake and a nursery cake to take along to my dad.

176
00:16:48.28 --> 00:16:54.92
And she said, Leo said, look, Mom, we're going a mile a minute now.

177
00:16:54.92 --> 00:16:58.04
Wow, that was moving.

178
00:16:58.04 --> 00:17:01.04
60 miles an hour.

179
00:17:01.04 --> 00:17:07.64
Man, what an advance from the horse, buggy.

180
00:17:07.64 --> 00:17:09.80
That's amazing.

181
00:17:09.80 --> 00:17:12.60
You mentioned some of these accidents.

182
00:17:12.60 --> 00:17:15.88
You mentioned the Windmill one, but it's a whole section.

183
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:18.24
You got a whole section in the book of when you're grown up.

184
00:17:18.24 --> 00:17:19.24
Just called accidents.

185
00:17:19.24 --> 00:17:25.48
You had your sister get injured by a manure spreader.

186
00:17:25.48 --> 00:17:29.28
You had a kid that got hit by a lightning.

187
00:17:29.28 --> 00:17:34.84
You had one of your brothers hit you in the face with a piece of, you know, they're getting

188
00:17:34.84 --> 00:17:35.84
into power.

189
00:17:35.84 --> 00:17:36.84
Right, right, right.

190
00:17:36.84 --> 00:17:38.32
Yeah, I got a lot of dirt.

191
00:17:38.32 --> 00:17:42.84
You guys were using dynamite when you were kids to blow stumps out of the ground.

192
00:17:42.84 --> 00:17:43.84
Yeah.

193
00:17:43.84 --> 00:17:48.52
Yeah, you talked about in here.

194
00:17:48.52 --> 00:17:55.76
Your brother Bobby, there's a windmill out by your house about 60 feet tall.

195
00:17:55.76 --> 00:17:58.24
Exactly, 60 foot.

196
00:17:58.24 --> 00:18:01.76
And there's a plank up 45 feet.

197
00:18:01.76 --> 00:18:05.000
And Bobby was up there, climbed up there.

198
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.76
You're telling him to get down before mom comes home.

199
00:18:08.76 --> 00:18:10.76
And, you know, he says, I don't worry about it.

200
00:18:10.76 --> 00:18:12.84
I'll be down by the time she gets here.

201
00:18:12.84 --> 00:18:15.24
And he did.

202
00:18:15.24 --> 00:18:17.04
Well, one step.

203
00:18:17.04 --> 00:18:21.80
Again, it's, I guess it's, we're kind of chuckling about it now, but man in the book here,

204
00:18:21.80 --> 00:18:25.36
let me read a little section from the book.

205
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:29.16
They heard him fall ran over and brought him into the house carrying him into the kitchen.

206
00:18:29.16 --> 00:18:33.92
His eyeballs were out of their sockets on his cheeks and blood shot out of his ears whenever

207
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:34.92
his heartbeat.

208
00:18:34.92 --> 00:18:36.80
He was out cold.

209
00:18:36.80 --> 00:18:40.76
Leo ran to Uncle Charlie's house because he had a phone to call Dr. Erbel, who put

210
00:18:40.76 --> 00:18:46.68
his eyeballs back into their sockets and caught into his ears to slow the bleeding.

211
00:18:46.68 --> 00:18:50.68
The doctor said is broken right arm, splitting it with cardboard.

212
00:18:50.68 --> 00:18:55.44
I didn't think he could get any worse, but the fall cracked his head too.

213
00:18:55.44 --> 00:18:58.68
The doctor instructed us get ice packs on his head.

214
00:18:58.68 --> 00:19:01.96
And we're still had an ice house about a mile from us, so we got the ice from there.

215
00:19:01.96 --> 00:19:07.000
Mom packed Bobby's ice, head in ice, held on with cloth diapers.

216
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.72
My mom tied him to the bed so he wouldn't move around feeding him soup and taking care of

217
00:19:10.72 --> 00:19:11.72
him.

218
00:19:11.72 --> 00:19:13.08
There's no nurse like a mother.

219
00:19:13.08 --> 00:19:14.08
He was her baby.

220
00:19:14.08 --> 00:19:18.56
For what seemed like a month, he lapsed in and out of consciousness until one day he sat

221
00:19:18.56 --> 00:19:20.96
up and bed asking, where's Jake?

222
00:19:20.96 --> 00:19:22.52
I want to play with Jake.

223
00:19:22.52 --> 00:19:23.52
And he was okay.

224
00:19:23.52 --> 00:19:24.52
Yeah.

225
00:19:24.52 --> 00:19:29.20
He lived until he was 75.

226
00:19:29.20 --> 00:19:33.40
He caught every disease known to man.

227
00:19:33.40 --> 00:19:44.04
And I worked right by him and took, took bass in the same tub, washed tub as he did.

228
00:19:44.04 --> 00:19:46.64
He had the measles that I never got him.

229
00:19:46.64 --> 00:19:52.92
I never had a childhood disease until I was 34 years old.

230
00:19:52.92 --> 00:19:58.72
And I got the lumps from my son, bringing him home from school.

231
00:19:58.72 --> 00:20:04.56
Yeah, you got some incredible detail about that stuff in the book too.

232
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:08.32
You ended up going to grammar school.

233
00:20:08.32 --> 00:20:09.40
You went to, what is it?

234
00:20:09.40 --> 00:20:10.40
Lemon township.

235
00:20:10.40 --> 00:20:11.40
Lemon township.

236
00:20:11.40 --> 00:20:12.40
Lemon township.

237
00:20:12.40 --> 00:20:13.40
Lemon township.

238
00:20:13.40 --> 00:20:16.000
You say you did homework by the carousene lamp light.

239
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Absolutely.

240
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yeah.

241
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.24
And that's, you're talking about how that lamp light would get dirty.

242
00:20:22.24 --> 00:20:24.000
You'd have to clean it before you start your homework.

243
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.64
Oh, yes.

244
00:20:25.64 --> 00:20:33.48
The, the wick would, would cloud, to, lamp glass.

245
00:20:33.48 --> 00:20:35.72
No, that was clear glass.

246
00:20:35.72 --> 00:20:36.72
The lamp.

247
00:20:36.72 --> 00:20:37.72
Right.

248
00:20:37.72 --> 00:20:41.60
No, that was, that was better than a candle.

249
00:20:41.60 --> 00:20:47.56
I guess the candles can only get so bright.

250
00:20:47.56 --> 00:20:49.52
Characters can light, it's can get pretty bright.

251
00:20:49.52 --> 00:20:55.12
Well, a lot brighter than anything else.

252
00:20:55.12 --> 00:20:58.68
It's, that, we thought, nothing else.

253
00:20:58.68 --> 00:21:02.12
We thought it was a modern age at that time.

254
00:21:02.12 --> 00:21:07.48
And we, we don't, we don't, we don't want everybody.

255
00:21:07.48 --> 00:21:11.96
But a, a round ever farmer.

256
00:21:11.96 --> 00:21:15.000
And we were just farmers.

257
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.72
Everybody lived the same way.

258
00:21:16.72 --> 00:21:18.60
They had to go to the same thing.

259
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:22.12
That, we weren't any different than anyone else.

260
00:21:22.12 --> 00:21:26.60
So, if, if you're not any different, you don't know the difference.

261
00:21:26.60 --> 00:21:34.76
You know, now it sounds like, went, what was normal for you, for you guys back then was,

262
00:21:34.76 --> 00:21:39.84
when you got done with kind of grammar school, when you got done with eighth grade, sometimes

263
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:41.56
you didn't, you didn't continue on with school.

264
00:21:41.56 --> 00:21:42.56
You didn't go to high school.

265
00:21:42.56 --> 00:21:46.12
There was no, there's, there's anybody going to high school.

266
00:21:46.12 --> 00:21:47.52
It was very unusual.

267
00:21:47.52 --> 00:21:50.40
That, that's someone to go to high school.

268
00:21:50.40 --> 00:21:54.40
And, and for you, you had Mrs. Jeffery, you sent a note home that said, I recommend that

269
00:21:54.40 --> 00:21:57.000
you let Jake go to high school because he's a fast learner.

270
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.40
That, that's it.

271
00:21:58.40 --> 00:21:59.40
Yeah, whole.

272
00:21:59.40 --> 00:22:00.40
Do I remember that?

273
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:02.40
Like yesterday.

274
00:22:02.40 --> 00:22:04.04
And how did your dad react to that?

275
00:22:04.04 --> 00:22:07.24
The hug, my dad says, there's no high school for you.

276
00:22:07.24 --> 00:22:09.28
You got chores to do.

277
00:22:09.28 --> 00:22:11.08
You got chores to do.

278
00:22:11.08 --> 00:22:15.08
So, and eventually it was your brother, Earl, that said.

279
00:22:15.08 --> 00:22:19.80
Was 14 years older than me, Earl, was.

280
00:22:19.80 --> 00:22:21.04
And he was a horse man.

281
00:22:21.04 --> 00:22:23.40
We had 30 horses at that time.

282
00:22:23.40 --> 00:22:26.60
No, don't know what's the thing, his tractors or anything.

283
00:22:26.60 --> 00:22:31.52
Everything was done by horse-strong machinery.

284
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:34.72
And Earl was, uh, took care of the horses.

285
00:22:34.72 --> 00:22:37.08
I am, shoot him.

286
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:48.32
And the, the doctoring arm, broken from wild horses to, uh, working in the harness.

287
00:22:48.32 --> 00:22:52.04
And he ended up telling your dad that he would help with the work so that you would

288
00:22:52.04 --> 00:22:53.04
be able to go to school.

289
00:22:53.04 --> 00:22:58.72
Yeah, he, he would do my chores for me if, if I got a chance to go to school.

290
00:22:58.72 --> 00:22:59.72
Yes.

291
00:22:59.72 --> 00:23:09.000
And he did, I did, I did, I dedicated part of this book to Earl, because I would not be

292
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.72
here today if he hadn't done it in my chores.

293
00:23:15.72 --> 00:23:20.72
Then the high school that you went to, you had to go and live somewhere else, right?

294
00:23:20.72 --> 00:23:24.56
Yeah, 14 miles away, and the roads are not open.

295
00:23:24.56 --> 00:23:27.80
And the winter time there, it was all done.

296
00:23:27.80 --> 00:23:35.84
Horses and slaves, so you, you, you can't go 14 miles every day, morning and night,

297
00:23:35.84 --> 00:23:37.36
in a slaves way.

298
00:23:37.36 --> 00:23:42.92
Yeah, I had to stay in town with someone.

299
00:23:42.92 --> 00:23:45.28
And then you ended up in order to pay for your room and board.

300
00:23:45.28 --> 00:23:49.44
You ended up pretty much working for one of your friends, moms who had a little place to

301
00:23:49.44 --> 00:23:50.44
stay.

302
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:51.44
And you helped out there.

303
00:23:51.44 --> 00:23:58.44
Oh, one of my lucky breaks again.

304
00:23:58.44 --> 00:24:04.08
I couldn't go out for any sports.

305
00:24:04.08 --> 00:24:10.24
And I had to run home at noon and put those, the meals on the table.

306
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:16.92
We had eight room and borders that I helped take care of.

307
00:24:16.92 --> 00:24:22.92
And I started at high school when I was 12 years old.

308
00:24:22.92 --> 00:24:28.48
I graduated at 12 and been born in December.

309
00:24:28.48 --> 00:24:34.04
I'm still 12 when I started high school in September.

310
00:24:34.04 --> 00:24:45.36
And it's crazy people say, whoa, but when you tell people, you're born in 1922.

311
00:24:45.36 --> 00:24:53.44
I didn't say a tell him that I only had 11 days in 1922, you know, more than December,

312
00:24:53.44 --> 00:24:54.44
20.

313
00:24:54.44 --> 00:24:59.04
So I was only 11 days old in 1922.

314
00:24:59.04 --> 00:25:04.96
They called it a full year, definitely.

315
00:25:04.96 --> 00:25:11.80
So I got to go to the book here this section here because it kind of starts off your military

316
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:12.80
career.

317
00:25:12.80 --> 00:25:17.92
In 30, I was walking around town on a Saturday afternoon with my cousin Chick outside

318
00:25:17.92 --> 00:25:19.24
Roxy Theater.

319
00:25:19.24 --> 00:25:20.44
We saw a sign.

320
00:25:20.44 --> 00:25:23.96
Saturday Matt and A Jean-Otchrey America's number one cowboy.

321
00:25:23.96 --> 00:25:27.76
It cost 10 cents, but we didn't have a penny between us.

322
00:25:27.76 --> 00:25:31.16
Chick suggested, Jake, let's join the National Guard.

323
00:25:31.16 --> 00:25:33.28
They pay $12 every three months.

324
00:25:33.28 --> 00:25:36.40
It sounded like a great way to ensure a steady income.

325
00:25:36.40 --> 00:25:39.20
But I pointed out, Chick, we're 15.

326
00:25:39.20 --> 00:25:40.84
You have to be 18.

327
00:25:40.84 --> 00:25:43.64
Chick was a lot taller and heavier set than me.

328
00:25:43.64 --> 00:25:45.24
We were like mutton Jeff.

329
00:25:45.24 --> 00:25:50.80
He answered, when they ask how old we are, just say 18, the worst they can do is kick us out.

330
00:25:50.80 --> 00:25:53.08
They aren't going to arrest us.

331
00:25:53.08 --> 00:25:57.88
So we walked into the office at the armory and I still remember the stocky captain's name,

332
00:25:57.88 --> 00:26:00.40
Captain Hugh H. Soper.

333
00:26:00.40 --> 00:26:04.20
He looked up from his desk asking, what can I do for you?

334
00:26:04.20 --> 00:26:06.80
Sir, we'd like to join the National Guard.

335
00:26:06.80 --> 00:26:11.12
I was expecting him to ask how old we were and I was ready to say 18.

336
00:26:11.12 --> 00:26:14.40
He looked me in the eyes and asked, what year were you born?

337
00:26:14.40 --> 00:26:17.88
Wow, I had to think quick. 1922, 1923.

338
00:26:17.88 --> 00:26:20.04
1919, sir.

339
00:26:20.04 --> 00:26:22.48
Chick added easy since he was just standing behind me.

340
00:26:22.48 --> 00:26:25.92
He just followed suit and answered the same thing.

341
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:30.40
Soper stamped out our enlistment papers and we were in.

342
00:26:30.40 --> 00:26:33.40
It was as easy as that, no physical or test required.

343
00:26:33.40 --> 00:26:41.36
I joined company F-135th Infantry Regiment of the 34th Infantry Division, the Red Balls.

344
00:26:41.36 --> 00:26:43.36
So you're 15 years old?

345
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:44.36
15 years old.

346
00:26:44.36 --> 00:26:46.28
Were you, did you look young?

347
00:26:46.28 --> 00:26:49.12
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:26:49.12 --> 00:26:50.12
Farmers looked rough.

349
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:52.40
Okay, so you looked a little bit older.

350
00:26:52.40 --> 00:26:54.40
We looked older.

351
00:26:54.40 --> 00:27:01.96
And at that time, the National Guard, this is when Hitler was taking the sedate in

352
00:27:01.96 --> 00:27:08.28
the end and had just an extra Austria in 1938.

353
00:27:08.28 --> 00:27:16.72
So our country was strictly against war.

354
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:18.36
Strictly against war.

355
00:27:18.36 --> 00:27:25.000
They didn't want anything to do with going to Europe and messing up with Hitler.

356
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.76
Hitler was pretty well known.

357
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:39.28
He wasn't known at that time of all the killings and labor camps that he had were forced

358
00:27:39.28 --> 00:27:43.72
labor.

359
00:27:43.72 --> 00:27:51.36
That all came out later and that when stuff like that comes out, it's like it is right now.

360
00:27:51.36 --> 00:27:57.60
It is hard to believe that a person can be that way.

361
00:27:57.60 --> 00:28:07.92
So the National Guard was trying to fill its units to get up to full strength so that

362
00:28:07.92 --> 00:28:13.32
in case of war they had strength in the National.

363
00:28:13.32 --> 00:28:19.04
The Army was only about 150,000 strong at that time.

364
00:28:19.04 --> 00:28:32.44
The whole Army in the United States was 150,000 and that's when President Roosevelt put

365
00:28:32.44 --> 00:28:39.28
28 or 29 National Guard units in the Federal Service.

366
00:28:39.28 --> 00:28:44.88
That was February 10, 1941.

367
00:28:44.88 --> 00:28:58.36
I had just turned 18 in December 20, 1940 and we put in the Federal Service and shipped

368
00:28:58.36 --> 00:29:02.56
down to Camp Clayborne, Louisiana.

369
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:13.20
So my god, I had nearly a year and there went through the Louisiana maneuvers, belly

370
00:29:13.20 --> 00:29:26.16
up, belly down, in Chigur, in Festa land, poisonous snakes.

371
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:27.64
What a place.

372
00:29:27.64 --> 00:29:29.92
It was a hell hole.

373
00:29:29.92 --> 00:29:34.56
You say in here I learned as much about training for war combat as I did about coping

374
00:29:34.56 --> 00:29:37.56
with Chigur's, ticks and intense humidity.

375
00:29:37.56 --> 00:29:41.56
Oh, god, it was terrible.

376
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:46.04
And so that you left for that February 1941.

377
00:29:46.04 --> 00:29:49.04
So we still weren't out war yet.

378
00:29:49.04 --> 00:29:53.08
But the country looked like we were heading in that direction.

379
00:29:53.08 --> 00:29:57.48
I know you mentioned in here one of your friends, Carlos Boke.

380
00:29:57.48 --> 00:30:00.64
Yeah, Carlos Boke, he told me Jake, let's join the Air Force.

381
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:04.36
I asked him why and he said the money is better and we'll get to be officers.

382
00:30:04.36 --> 00:30:05.72
I thought that sounded good.

383
00:30:05.72 --> 00:30:11.000
At the time I was a corporal getting $42 a month while a private earned $30 a month.

384
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.88
Carlos and I decided to try and enlist.

385
00:30:12.88 --> 00:30:14.52
So we went through the physicals and written tests.

386
00:30:14.52 --> 00:30:16.12
The physicals involved in I exam.

387
00:30:16.12 --> 00:30:17.72
Carlos passed his.

388
00:30:17.72 --> 00:30:19.04
But they told me I was colorblind.

389
00:30:19.04 --> 00:30:23.000
I had no idea that I found out my brother Todd was also colorblind.

390
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.28
So you tried to join the Air Force, but you couldn't see colors.

391
00:30:26.28 --> 00:30:27.28
They wouldn't let you in.

392
00:30:27.28 --> 00:30:28.28
So you stayed in the Army.

393
00:30:28.28 --> 00:30:30.44
So I stayed in the Army.

394
00:30:30.44 --> 00:30:31.44
And I'm here today.

395
00:30:31.44 --> 00:30:35.44
There's another thing, luckiest man in the world.

396
00:30:35.44 --> 00:30:37.92
I turned out to be colorblind.

397
00:30:37.92 --> 00:30:41.56
I said the Army didn't know that.

398
00:30:41.56 --> 00:30:45.76
I had never had a physical for colorblindness.

399
00:30:45.76 --> 00:30:50.24
And the Air Corps didn't tell them that I was colorblind.

400
00:30:50.24 --> 00:30:56.92
But it's an interesting thing there.

401
00:30:56.92 --> 00:31:07.68
If you want me to relate on Carlos Boke, I will tell you that I am lucky probably that I

402
00:31:07.68 --> 00:31:11.72
didn't join the Air Force.

403
00:31:11.72 --> 00:31:14.72
Get into the aviation.

404
00:31:14.72 --> 00:31:27.92
Carlos Boke died on his graduation day in a flyby to planes collided.

405
00:31:27.92 --> 00:31:28.92
And burned.

406
00:31:28.92 --> 00:31:36.04
They don't even know which body they ship back to Barry.

407
00:31:36.04 --> 00:31:38.000
Here I am.

408
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.08
He was 19 years old at the time.

409
00:31:41.08 --> 00:31:42.96
Here I am.

410
00:31:42.96 --> 00:31:59.08
Going on 99, with a family, a family, grandchildren, great grandchildren.

411
00:31:59.08 --> 00:32:05.72
Can you question why I say I'm the luckiest man in the world?

412
00:32:05.72 --> 00:32:14.52
No questions from my side of the table sir.

413
00:32:14.52 --> 00:32:21.24
So Pearl Harbor happens, December 7, 1941.

414
00:32:21.24 --> 00:32:29.76
I kind of wanted to portray a little bit of your, let's say, you have a little rebellious spirit.

415
00:32:29.76 --> 00:32:33.56
You had a little rebellious spirit with you her younger.

416
00:32:33.56 --> 00:32:38.52
Arnold Schmidt, 135th Infantry Commanding Officer announced that all the company clerks

417
00:32:38.52 --> 00:32:41.40
he had authority over were authorized 15 day furlough.

418
00:32:41.40 --> 00:32:43.24
So you were going to get 15 days of leave.

419
00:32:43.24 --> 00:32:50.12
Now Captain Eric, it's an Ericson told you, hey, get everyone set.

420
00:32:50.12 --> 00:32:52.48
Only give people seven days.

421
00:32:52.48 --> 00:32:55.72
And you told him sir, everyone will have to turn around and come home before they even

422
00:32:55.72 --> 00:32:56.72
get there.

423
00:32:56.72 --> 00:33:01.24
And he said, Corporal, I'm your commanding officer, you will do as you are told.

424
00:33:01.24 --> 00:33:08.12
And so you do what you're told except for on your papers, you give yourself 15 days of leave.

425
00:33:08.12 --> 00:33:11.08
So you can get back home spend some time then come back.

426
00:33:11.08 --> 00:33:14.60
And he just went through the stack of papers and signed them all.

427
00:33:14.60 --> 00:33:17.44
And you took your 15 days.

428
00:33:17.44 --> 00:33:22.36
That changed my life.

429
00:33:22.36 --> 00:33:26.56
Captain Ericson was killed in a North Africa invasion.

430
00:33:26.56 --> 00:33:33.88
So 34th Division went down to North Africa at Morocco or Algeria there.

431
00:33:33.88 --> 00:33:37.20
And he was killed down there.

432
00:33:37.20 --> 00:33:40.96
And the company clerk is close to your captain.

433
00:33:40.96 --> 00:33:49.88
So in the meantime, I got transferred in to fifth corps.

434
00:33:49.88 --> 00:33:52.60
Right, he was trying to punish you by giving you.

435
00:33:52.60 --> 00:33:53.60
He was trying to punish me.

436
00:33:53.60 --> 00:33:55.000
He was giving you away from him.

437
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:06.60
Now he was going to be climbing poles and string and wires, according to Captain Ericson.

438
00:34:06.60 --> 00:34:13.36
But then you ended up going into the G3 into operations.

439
00:34:13.36 --> 00:34:18.72
I was only operation sergeant there.

440
00:34:18.72 --> 00:34:20.32
Now is that because you knew how to type?

441
00:34:20.32 --> 00:34:24.40
Yes, that's because I was an expert type.

442
00:34:24.40 --> 00:34:25.96
How did you learn how to type?

443
00:34:25.96 --> 00:34:28.52
I had one year of typing in high school.

444
00:34:28.52 --> 00:34:32.52
So you didn't elect him.

445
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:38.32
I was the only boy in a class of 30.

446
00:34:38.32 --> 00:34:41.80
And ended up being an extremely important skill for your whole life.

447
00:34:41.80 --> 00:34:44.64
It changed my life.

448
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:46.16
Being able to type.

449
00:34:46.16 --> 00:34:48.16
You say here, being part of the G3.

450
00:34:48.16 --> 00:34:49.76
So G3 for people that don't know.

451
00:34:49.76 --> 00:34:50.76
This is operations.

452
00:34:50.76 --> 00:34:54.36
These are people that are coming up with the plans and directing how these operations are

453
00:34:54.36 --> 00:34:56.60
going to go.

454
00:34:56.60 --> 00:35:00.04
And you say here, man, being a part of G3 is a whole different world.

455
00:35:00.04 --> 00:35:05.04
Instead of reporting to a captain or lieutenant, I had to report to a full bird colonel or

456
00:35:05.04 --> 00:35:07.44
a lieutenant colonel.

457
00:35:07.44 --> 00:35:11.88
You said once I was part of G3, I met who would become one of my closest friends while

458
00:35:11.88 --> 00:35:14.08
in the service, corporal Madison Rich.

459
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:18.12
He was from New Jersey and was a skilled type as just like myself.

460
00:35:18.12 --> 00:35:21.68
You said when I had free time, this is by the way, this is when you're fast forward

461
00:35:21.68 --> 00:35:22.68
past this part.

462
00:35:22.68 --> 00:35:28.92
You're overseas, you're now in Ireland and England and you guys are preparing for the

463
00:35:28.92 --> 00:35:29.92
invasion.

464
00:35:29.92 --> 00:35:34.04
You say when I had free time, I'd hang out with my other pals, corporal Kray and staff

465
00:35:34.04 --> 00:35:36.24
sergeant Robby Robert Jeffrey.

466
00:35:36.24 --> 00:35:39.96
Kray was the cochiest Irishman I ever met while Jeffrey was subdued.

467
00:35:39.96 --> 00:35:45.04
I was only 19 at the time and they were both much older than me because of my slight

468
00:35:45.04 --> 00:35:46.04
stature.

469
00:35:46.04 --> 00:35:48.40
They nicknamed me Bony As.

470
00:35:48.40 --> 00:35:56.96
Well, I was five foot 10, way to 120 pounds.

471
00:35:56.96 --> 00:36:03.12
I luckiest man in the world.

472
00:36:03.12 --> 00:36:06.92
When I landed on D-Day, we were under a lot of fire.

473
00:36:06.92 --> 00:36:14.04
I had two of those M-G-42 machine guns shooting at me.

474
00:36:14.04 --> 00:36:20.12
They only shoot 1200 rounds a minute each one.

475
00:36:20.12 --> 00:36:26.80
So when you double it, it's quite a thing.

476
00:36:26.80 --> 00:36:33.16
But the Germans were not used to shooting at toothpicks.

477
00:36:33.16 --> 00:36:37.16
I made it through.

478
00:36:37.16 --> 00:36:43.80
Before you get to D-Day, you have one incident that I just, I had to bring up because it

479
00:36:43.80 --> 00:36:47.16
is another thing that had a big impact on your life.

480
00:36:47.16 --> 00:36:50.92
You were taking some pictures and there was a major that you were with.

481
00:36:50.92 --> 00:36:57.28
And you said he had gotten out of his Jeep while he was talking to me.

482
00:36:57.28 --> 00:37:02.16
So I sat down in the Jeep and handed him my 35 millimeter Argus camera.

483
00:37:02.16 --> 00:37:04.96
Here major, can you take a picture of me sitting in your Jeep?

484
00:37:04.96 --> 00:37:09.60
What's funny about the picture is that it was the only Jeep I ever sat in while I was

485
00:37:09.60 --> 00:37:10.60
in the service.

486
00:37:10.60 --> 00:37:13.80
I sent that picture along with other pictures to my mother, my dad looked through them and

487
00:37:13.80 --> 00:37:18.96
picked the picture of me sitting in the Jeep to bring to the photo news.

488
00:37:18.96 --> 00:37:23.12
They liked it well enough to put in their paper, adding a blurb about Corporal Jake

489
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:24.92
Larson in North Ireland.

490
00:37:24.92 --> 00:37:29.16
I was unaware of it at the time, but that picture being published in the paper would

491
00:37:29.16 --> 00:37:35.60
lead me to the love of my life and we'll get to that later.

492
00:37:35.60 --> 00:37:39.92
At this point, now you guys are, and again, I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

493
00:37:39.92 --> 00:37:45.16
And now you leave to go to Port Smith to start the planning for Port Smith.

494
00:37:45.16 --> 00:37:46.16
Port Smith, okay.

495
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:48.000
I'll say it that way.

496
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.28
So you guys go to Port Smith to start the planning.

497
00:37:53.28 --> 00:37:57.12
You're promoted to Sergeant.

498
00:37:57.12 --> 00:38:03.92
This is where you participate in that operation or the training operation that slapped

499
00:38:03.92 --> 00:38:08.80
in Sands, what you talked about earlier, just an unbelievable travesty.

500
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:11.12
You go on this training mission.

501
00:38:11.12 --> 00:38:20.84
These ships are filled with soldiers to practice D-Day and the Germans actually sank some

502
00:38:20.84 --> 00:38:23.52
of those ships to those ships.

503
00:38:23.52 --> 00:38:29.36
795 people killed before D-Day even happened during a training operation.

504
00:38:29.36 --> 00:38:34.32
One month before D-Day.

505
00:38:34.32 --> 00:38:39.96
The Americans that died during that, they reported, they told the families that they died

506
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:40.96
during D-Day.

507
00:38:40.96 --> 00:38:41.96
Absolutely.

508
00:38:41.96 --> 00:38:42.96
Yeah.

509
00:38:42.96 --> 00:38:50.40
And that brings us to D-Day.

510
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:57.48
And I just want to read some of this and just get your feedback on it.

511
00:38:57.48 --> 00:39:01.36
D-Day was supposed to be June 5th, so all the troops were loaded into ships the day before

512
00:39:01.36 --> 00:39:06.76
including me, the sea was getting rough from rougher so they called it off and we had to return.

513
00:39:06.76 --> 00:39:10.20
They had a British weathermaster who told Eisenhower there would be a break in the weather

514
00:39:10.20 --> 00:39:16.04
in the morning, so he decided to have the invasion go on June 6th.

515
00:39:16.04 --> 00:39:21.72
By the time of the change, I hadn't slept for 72 hours just running on adrenaline.

516
00:39:21.72 --> 00:39:27.36
There are 7,000 ships on the move with 158,000 troops and our destination about 170 miles

517
00:39:27.36 --> 00:39:32.60
away, everywhere you look there was a ship and they were going to different beaches.

518
00:39:32.60 --> 00:39:34.88
Everything was programmed.

519
00:39:34.88 --> 00:39:40.12
I went in with the members of the first Infantry Division on the USS Ancon, which was

520
00:39:40.12 --> 00:39:45.96
the command ship, about 8 miles from shore, the landing craft pulled up alongside us so

521
00:39:45.96 --> 00:39:53.36
we had to climb down rope ladders into the boat carrying 75 pounds of gear and our rifles.

522
00:39:53.36 --> 00:39:58.24
When we dropped into the landing craft which was bobbing up and down in three to four foot

523
00:39:58.24 --> 00:40:09.24
waves, we see images produced by computers to simulate what it looked like with all those

524
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:11.28
ships on D-Day.

525
00:40:11.28 --> 00:40:13.88
That must have been an incredible sight.

526
00:40:13.88 --> 00:40:23.52
It's even harder to describe how do you describe it?

527
00:40:23.52 --> 00:40:30.000
Ever place you look, there's a ship and behind it, another ship and behind that more ships,

528
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.56
more ships, more ships.

529
00:40:34.56 --> 00:40:44.64
How do you crowd 7,000 ships into a small area like that there?

530
00:40:44.64 --> 00:40:50.96
I'm on the Ancon, that's where I didn't have a word.

531
00:40:50.96 --> 00:40:58.28
The commander, a little farm boy from Houghton, Minnesota.

532
00:40:58.28 --> 00:41:05.28
Only graduated high school.

533
00:41:05.28 --> 00:41:14.76
I worked on the invasion with Colonel Hill.

534
00:41:14.76 --> 00:41:20.08
I got the brown star for what I did, worked on.

535
00:41:20.08 --> 00:41:23.08
I didn't even know I was going to get it.

536
00:41:23.08 --> 00:41:26.60
But it's crazy.

537
00:41:26.60 --> 00:41:34.24
Did you guys, since you were part of the planning, you must have had very good awareness

538
00:41:34.24 --> 00:41:38.12
of what you were going into in terms of the enemy positions?

539
00:41:38.12 --> 00:41:39.32
Oh, yeah.

540
00:41:39.32 --> 00:41:44.48
It seems like you would have known even more what you were facing than the normal soldiers

541
00:41:44.48 --> 00:41:47.12
who maybe weren't as involved in the planning.

542
00:41:47.12 --> 00:41:51.56
I was not a normal soldier at that time.

543
00:41:51.56 --> 00:41:57.08
I was the highest classified person you can get.

544
00:41:57.08 --> 00:42:02.24
I was top secret, bigot, B-A-G-O-T.

545
00:42:02.24 --> 00:42:08.92
Most people don't even know what bigot is, but that's the highest rating you can get.

546
00:42:08.92 --> 00:42:09.92
Think about it.

547
00:42:09.92 --> 00:42:15.52
A little farm boy from Houghton, Minnesota.

548
00:42:15.52 --> 00:42:20.68
When I told people that afterwards that I was classified top secret bigot.

549
00:42:20.68 --> 00:42:21.68
Yeah, what's that?

550
00:42:21.68 --> 00:42:28.28
Yeah, no, I didn't mean anything to them.

551
00:42:28.28 --> 00:42:32.80
And this was your first combat operation, was D-Day?

552
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:33.80
Absolutely.

553
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:38.60
It was the first for all of our troops.

554
00:42:38.60 --> 00:42:42.24
What was the fear level for you?

555
00:42:42.24 --> 00:42:43.80
There was no fear level.

556
00:42:43.80 --> 00:42:50.64
We'd been over the England then for two and a half years.

557
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:56.56
We'd been over there planning this thing.

558
00:42:56.56 --> 00:43:00.64
And we wanted to get it done.

559
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:01.64
Get it done.

560
00:43:01.64 --> 00:43:04.32
They kept putting it off and putting it off.

561
00:43:04.32 --> 00:43:09.76
And finally, when you got the goal, the weather wasn't very good.

562
00:43:09.76 --> 00:43:19.92
But in the longland of weather kind of helped us, it took to Germans off guard.

563
00:43:19.92 --> 00:43:30.28
And Rama, who was guarding that part, went home to celebrate his wife's birthday.

564
00:43:30.28 --> 00:43:34.84
You say here, I was the last off, last one off the ship when they dumped us out too far.

565
00:43:34.84 --> 00:43:38.28
We marched off the ramp into the water and all walked in a line.

566
00:43:38.28 --> 00:43:42.92
I made my way into the icy water that reached up to my chin, holding my rifle over

567
00:43:42.92 --> 00:43:43.92
my head.

568
00:43:43.92 --> 00:43:45.96
But I wasn't thinking about the water's temperature.

569
00:43:45.96 --> 00:43:48.16
I just wanted to get through it alive.

570
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:51.68
The section of shore I landed on was known as Easy Red.

571
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:55.56
We were supposed to be able to walk through the surf and find bomb holes, which would

572
00:43:55.56 --> 00:43:57.04
be shelters for us.

573
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:02.20
The air core totally missed Omaha Beach, so there was no protection for us.

574
00:44:02.20 --> 00:44:04.40
Those beaches were all mined.

575
00:44:04.40 --> 00:44:09.04
I would find out later in life that there were millions of mines on that beach.

576
00:44:09.04 --> 00:44:12.72
If you stepped on one of those babies, it was a quick trip to heaven.

577
00:44:12.72 --> 00:44:16.36
I was more afraid of stepping on a mine than being shot at.

578
00:44:16.36 --> 00:44:21.16
I ran toward the cliffs, making sure to step in the same footprints as the man in front

579
00:44:21.16 --> 00:44:23.40
of me made.

580
00:44:23.40 --> 00:44:25.80
What the hell am I doing here?

581
00:44:25.80 --> 00:44:29.96
The fog pounded in my head as I dodged bullets determined to stay focused on reaching

582
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:32.32
the safety of the cliffs.

583
00:44:32.32 --> 00:44:38.36
How did a simple foreign boy from Minnesota land on Omaha Beach on D-Day?

584
00:44:38.36 --> 00:44:42.36
Machines guns were firing in all directions with bodies everywhere.

585
00:44:42.36 --> 00:44:48.24
Those MG-42 machine guns shot 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute.

586
00:44:48.24 --> 00:44:52.48
I ran and dodged, finally making my way to a sand berm.

587
00:44:52.48 --> 00:44:56.32
The bullets were blasting off the berm as I ducked into it.

588
00:44:56.32 --> 00:45:00.12
I wasn't going to get out of that whole no matter what.

589
00:45:00.12 --> 00:45:04.24
I smoked at that time and I had my cigarettes in this plastic bag so they wouldn't get

590
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:05.24
wet.

591
00:45:05.24 --> 00:45:07.60
Unfortunately, I didn't have a match.

592
00:45:07.60 --> 00:45:10.60
I remember then that I started shaking.

593
00:45:10.60 --> 00:45:13.000
Before that moment I had felt no fear.

594
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.04
I turned to my left and saw soldier lying down with his back toward me.

595
00:45:18.04 --> 00:45:22.20
I called out, hey buddy, do you have a match?

596
00:45:22.20 --> 00:45:27.08
Then I noticed there was no head underneath the helmet.

597
00:45:27.08 --> 00:45:28.36
That got me moving.

598
00:45:28.36 --> 00:45:29.36
Jake moved.

599
00:45:29.36 --> 00:45:34.24
I told myself, I got up and dashed for the bottom of the cliff wall about 200 yards

600
00:45:34.24 --> 00:45:35.24
away.

601
00:45:35.24 --> 00:45:38.64
I remember saying to myself, Jake, what the hell are you doing here?

602
00:45:38.64 --> 00:45:41.96
You're running for your life, so nobody can shoot at you, but everybody can shoot at

603
00:45:41.96 --> 00:45:43.20
you.

604
00:45:43.20 --> 00:45:47.68
I only weighed 120 pounds soaking wet, so that was an advantage since it's hard to shoot

605
00:45:47.68 --> 00:45:49.52
at a toothpick.

606
00:45:49.52 --> 00:45:55.68
After what seemed like an eternity, I made it to the cliff wall where I was safe.

607
00:45:55.68 --> 00:46:01.76
From what I've read over 2,500 died at Omaha Beach that day.

608
00:46:01.76 --> 00:46:06.16
That was on easier read.

609
00:46:06.16 --> 00:46:16.68
I went in on that's where I went in.

610
00:46:16.68 --> 00:46:28.48
I went back to Omaha Beach on the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

611
00:46:28.48 --> 00:46:50.28
I had five different TV stations, BBC, France 1, France 2, CBS, NBC, waiting at the cemetery

612
00:46:50.28 --> 00:46:52.24
of an Omaha Beach cemetery.

613
00:46:52.24 --> 00:47:02.44
I have never been in a cemetery after time, and they said, we want you to walk out there

614
00:47:02.44 --> 00:47:13.000
and look at one of the tombstones and stand out while we take pictures.

615
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I walked out there.

616
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.20
I told you, I came in with a part of the first division, the 16th infantry regiment.

617
00:47:22.20 --> 00:47:35.28
And the first tombstone I landed, looked at, said that, here this private from the 16th

618
00:47:35.28 --> 00:47:40.56
infantry regiment was buried there.

619
00:47:40.56 --> 00:47:45.32
I'm sending there with my hat on a coat.

620
00:47:45.32 --> 00:47:51.44
I didn't know that you don't salute.

621
00:47:51.44 --> 00:47:58.36
So I raised my right hand with my hat above my head.

622
00:47:58.36 --> 00:48:08.04
That picture with viral all over the world.

623
00:48:08.04 --> 00:48:20.92
It's like the ghosts of those guys buried there that day were down there watching me.

624
00:48:20.92 --> 00:48:32.000
And when I raised my hat in salute to them, it's like a response that I got from the

625
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.20
guys.

626
00:48:34.20 --> 00:48:37.48
After all, I'm not the hero.

627
00:48:37.48 --> 00:48:40.44
Those guys that are buried there in the heroes.

628
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:48.40
I made it true because they put their life up for me.

629
00:48:48.40 --> 00:48:50.52
I keep telling people.

630
00:48:50.52 --> 00:48:53.000
I am not the hero.

631
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.60
I'm a hero too.

632
00:48:54.60 --> 00:48:55.60
I told you.

633
00:48:55.60 --> 00:48:59.000
I changed from hero to hero too.

634
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
They said, what is a hero too?

635
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.32
I mean, here to tell you the story of my life and it's unbelievable.

636
00:49:07.32 --> 00:49:12.04
But I'm here because of that.

637
00:49:12.04 --> 00:49:18.32
That's what's got me through life.

638
00:49:18.32 --> 00:49:26.04
So when you got to the cliff and now you're, so you're, I guess you're a little bit out

639
00:49:26.04 --> 00:49:27.04
of the enemy fires.

640
00:49:27.04 --> 00:49:28.04
They're still in fire.

641
00:49:28.04 --> 00:49:29.04
They can't fire them.

642
00:49:29.04 --> 00:49:30.04
They can't fire them.

643
00:49:30.04 --> 00:49:31.04
I don't understand themselves.

644
00:49:31.04 --> 00:49:32.04
Got it.

645
00:49:32.04 --> 00:49:35.88
But you still have to push through barbed wire and the guys start getting out the Bangalore

646
00:49:35.88 --> 00:49:36.88
torpedoes, right?

647
00:49:36.88 --> 00:49:37.88
Yeah.

648
00:49:37.88 --> 00:49:44.52
And that was a dangerous one because the guy to shove those Bangalore torpedoes up two of them

649
00:49:44.52 --> 00:49:46.88
were killed right there.

650
00:49:46.88 --> 00:49:53.64
But as quick as they went off and we started to go up and got behind the Germans, they

651
00:49:53.64 --> 00:49:55.52
have no protection.

652
00:49:55.52 --> 00:49:58.80
They cleared out fast.

653
00:49:58.80 --> 00:50:00.68
So it didn't take long.

654
00:50:00.68 --> 00:50:08.28
And then we got to set up, I have periods of total blankness in this.

655
00:50:08.28 --> 00:50:09.44
This is one of them.

656
00:50:09.44 --> 00:50:14.08
The next thing I knew, we had set up the command post.

657
00:50:14.08 --> 00:50:17.68
But I don't even remember setting it up.

658
00:50:17.68 --> 00:50:24.72
And I was, they get a foxhole with corpile rich.

659
00:50:24.72 --> 00:50:29.04
And that's a kind of an interesting thing too.

660
00:50:29.04 --> 00:50:30.04
If you.

661
00:50:30.04 --> 00:50:31.04
Yeah.

662
00:50:31.04 --> 00:50:33.80
So you're setting up this command post.

663
00:50:33.80 --> 00:50:36.08
You don't remember a lot of it.

664
00:50:36.08 --> 00:50:40.84
And you say, I was relieved to see my good friend, corpile Madison Rich, who arrived in

665
00:50:40.84 --> 00:50:43.92
the different land in craft and I.

666
00:50:43.92 --> 00:50:48.68
Right there must have been amazing to see all these guys get killed.

667
00:50:48.68 --> 00:50:52.68
And you happen to one of your other friends from a different land in craft happens to make

668
00:50:52.68 --> 00:50:55.04
it.

669
00:50:55.04 --> 00:50:57.72
He stayed in the foxhole next to mine.

670
00:50:57.72 --> 00:51:00.08
And I had my litter down to my foxhole.

671
00:51:00.08 --> 00:51:04.20
A litter was just a canvas claw fast between two removable sticks on either side.

672
00:51:04.20 --> 00:51:08.000
I slept on top of it to keep moisture and dampness off my body.

673
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.44
We didn't have sleeping bags.

674
00:51:09.44 --> 00:51:14.88
We made our own with wool blankets provided calling them fart sacks, which by the way, we

675
00:51:14.88 --> 00:51:19.44
still called sleeping bags fart sacks in the military when I was in.

676
00:51:19.44 --> 00:51:22.20
Once I found out, I had to work that night.

677
00:51:22.20 --> 00:51:25.32
I told Corpore Rich, you can sleep in my foxhole tonight.

678
00:51:25.32 --> 00:51:27.04
I've got the litter in there.

679
00:51:27.04 --> 00:51:28.04
Thanks, Jake.

680
00:51:28.04 --> 00:51:30.16
I got my fart sack all made up now.

681
00:51:30.16 --> 00:51:32.04
I'm not changing it.

682
00:51:32.04 --> 00:51:37.28
Nevertheless, he laid his M1 rifle on my litter and went to sleep.

683
00:51:37.28 --> 00:51:41.28
That night, the Germans wanted to see what we were up to, so they sent over reconnaissance

684
00:51:41.28 --> 00:51:44.56
planes, dropping flares to take pictures after midnight.

685
00:51:44.56 --> 00:51:46.52
They lit up the beach light daylight.

686
00:51:46.52 --> 00:51:49.72
Our anti-aircraft started shooting at up at those planes.

687
00:51:49.72 --> 00:51:51.68
Well, what goes up must come down.

688
00:51:51.68 --> 00:51:56.84
So when Maddie Rich got up in the morning, he went to pick up his rifle and my foxhole

689
00:51:56.84 --> 00:51:59.08
only for it to fall in two pieces.

690
00:51:59.08 --> 00:52:03.92
The strap-in-all from our men shooting at the Germans had hit his rifle during the night.

691
00:52:03.92 --> 00:52:05.48
Talk about luck.

692
00:52:05.48 --> 00:52:09.88
It had called on me to work that night and he's fortunate he didn't take me up on my

693
00:52:09.88 --> 00:52:12.52
offer of sleeping there.

694
00:52:12.52 --> 00:52:15.52
So there you go.

695
00:52:15.52 --> 00:52:24.60
It seems like it's a story in my life to be in the right place at the right time.

696
00:52:24.60 --> 00:52:30.24
Yeah, so in your bed where you were going to sleep that night, the rifle that was sitting

697
00:52:30.24 --> 00:52:31.24
on your bed.

698
00:52:31.24 --> 00:52:33.24
That was a plan I'd have.

699
00:52:33.24 --> 00:52:36.32
It fell in two, yeah.

700
00:52:36.32 --> 00:52:48.96
If ever some M1 grand, that's a pretty hefty gun, pretty hefty rifle.

701
00:52:48.96 --> 00:52:52.08
It's a ways eight pounds.

702
00:52:52.08 --> 00:53:00.20
So it had to take some kind of a direct hit to be able to fall in two.

703
00:53:00.20 --> 00:53:05.24
And during this time you're supposed to be working during the day and then getting some

704
00:53:05.24 --> 00:53:06.64
sleep at night.

705
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:10.88
But what's happening for these first five, six, seven days, you're working during the

706
00:53:10.88 --> 00:53:13.36
day and then at night you all have to move.

707
00:53:13.36 --> 00:53:15.40
So you're not getting any sleep at all.

708
00:53:15.40 --> 00:53:23.32
Well, I'm actually all took place during the day.

709
00:53:23.32 --> 00:53:30.36
Very little action during the night.

710
00:53:30.36 --> 00:53:38.60
So when I tried to sleep during the day, the Germans would shower.

711
00:53:38.60 --> 00:53:46.64
I was right up to say, say, low then was the place where we were trying to capture.

712
00:53:46.64 --> 00:53:51.08
And they told us, it's going to take a few days to capture.

713
00:53:51.08 --> 00:53:53.68
Focus a month.

714
00:53:53.68 --> 00:53:54.68
Focus a month.

715
00:53:54.68 --> 00:53:58.56
The Germans don't like to give up.

716
00:53:58.56 --> 00:54:01.16
And they are great fighters.

717
00:54:01.16 --> 00:54:04.28
Man, we had our hands full.

718
00:54:04.28 --> 00:54:10.56
But we covered a book on this podcast called The Clay Pigeons, the St.

719
00:54:10.56 --> 00:54:15.32
Low by Glover Johns, who was one of the officers that fought there.

720
00:54:15.32 --> 00:54:17.84
And so you were there for that.

721
00:54:17.84 --> 00:54:21.80
You say about a month after the day we were supposed to capture a little town called St.

722
00:54:21.80 --> 00:54:22.80
Low.

723
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:25.32
We moved from the cliffs to the hedgerodes of the town.

724
00:54:25.32 --> 00:54:28.92
We planned to capture it without the lab, but it took us about a month because the Germans

725
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:31.44
put up such stiff resistance.

726
00:54:31.44 --> 00:54:35.60
We put out orders and then different units under our command carried them out.

727
00:54:35.60 --> 00:54:39.76
At that time, other infantry units had landed on D. Day with us and those troops were under

728
00:54:39.76 --> 00:54:41.40
our control.

729
00:54:41.40 --> 00:54:44.52
We would storm them or open fire.

730
00:54:44.52 --> 00:54:47.80
The Germans didn't count. They didn't factor into the equation.

731
00:54:47.80 --> 00:54:49.56
You have to take that position in war.

732
00:54:49.56 --> 00:54:53.52
If they're in the way or on the road, you just rush them off.

733
00:54:53.52 --> 00:54:57.96
That's why so many civilians were killed during the war.

734
00:54:57.96 --> 00:55:00.36
We tore the hell out of St. Low.

735
00:55:00.36 --> 00:55:03.12
I spent most of my time during the daylight thinking of getting some sleep.

736
00:55:03.12 --> 00:55:05.12
But again, we were always on the move.

737
00:55:05.12 --> 00:55:07.36
We were captured after we captured St. Low.

738
00:55:07.36 --> 00:55:12.68
I went to bed in the morning and woke up at 2am, unable to remember how I got there.

739
00:55:12.68 --> 00:55:16.04
I had been numb, thinking only of sleep, sleep, sleep.

740
00:55:16.04 --> 00:55:20.84
Each soldier carries a tent shell, half tent shell.

741
00:55:20.84 --> 00:55:26.36
So I put my shelter half in a ditch and there was three feet high next to the road.

742
00:55:26.36 --> 00:55:30.60
If you don't have another soldier with you, you have to make do with you half a tent.

743
00:55:30.60 --> 00:55:32.88
I was thinking about brushing my teeth and shaving.

744
00:55:32.88 --> 00:55:35.52
I noticed another soldier walking around carrying something.

745
00:55:35.52 --> 00:55:38.72
I took the line around my helmet and poured some water into it.

746
00:55:38.72 --> 00:55:43.04
So I could brush my teeth and was just about to shave when one of the soldiers asked,

747
00:55:43.04 --> 00:55:44.84
hey, what the hell are you doing here?

748
00:55:44.84 --> 00:55:45.84
I explained I'm going to shave.

749
00:55:45.84 --> 00:55:46.84
I work at night.

750
00:55:46.84 --> 00:55:48.24
I just woke up.

751
00:55:48.24 --> 00:55:49.92
He said this is supposed to be all clear.

752
00:55:49.92 --> 00:55:58.12
There's a 155 mm shell laying on the road and we're sandbagging it to detonate it.

753
00:55:58.12 --> 00:56:02.40
So there you are going to brush your teeth and there's an exploded shell.

754
00:56:02.40 --> 00:56:03.96
You happen to run into these guys.

755
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:15.12
I don't think if that thing went off, I don't think even the luck would get you through

756
00:56:15.12 --> 00:56:16.12
that one.

757
00:56:16.12 --> 00:56:17.12
No, no, not the one.

758
00:56:17.12 --> 00:56:19.24
But again, my luck held off.

759
00:56:19.24 --> 00:56:20.72
You're lucky, I hope.

760
00:56:20.72 --> 00:56:25.60
Here's another one.

761
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:30.32
Another piece of evidence for the luckiest man in the world.

762
00:56:30.32 --> 00:56:31.72
Colonel Hill asked me what I was doing.

763
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:33.52
I said I was thinking about getting something eat.

764
00:56:33.52 --> 00:56:38.36
He said I got a Jeep coming up from the motor pool and I'll sit, I'd like to you to

765
00:56:38.36 --> 00:56:42.56
ride along with it to look at our next command post to check it out.

766
00:56:42.56 --> 00:56:44.20
For Colonel Hill, I would do anything.

767
00:56:44.20 --> 00:56:47.92
The guy saved my life a few times by putting me in charge of the night shift.

768
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:50.08
I responded gladly, sir.

769
00:56:50.08 --> 00:56:52.68
We had a hand drawn map of the area.

770
00:56:52.68 --> 00:56:55.04
A private drove the Jeep as I looked at the map.

771
00:56:55.04 --> 00:56:57.52
Suddenly I realized we missed the turnoff.

772
00:56:57.52 --> 00:56:59.76
So I said to the private, I think we missed the turnoff.

773
00:56:59.76 --> 00:57:02.32
It was there was a ditch there.

774
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:05.08
The culvert indicated the road's entrance.

775
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:10.96
So just as he got the Jeep turned around, another Jeep turned down that road, hit a

776
00:57:10.96 --> 00:57:13.64
line line and blew up.

777
00:57:13.64 --> 00:57:16.44
That was the place we were supposed to turn.

778
00:57:16.44 --> 00:57:18.88
Somebody was looking out for me, I swear.

779
00:57:18.88 --> 00:57:22.04
I went, we went back to Colonel Hill, reporting the incident.

780
00:57:22.04 --> 00:57:27.76
He uttered you're like a cat with nine lives.

781
00:57:27.76 --> 00:57:39.88
Yeah, you're using up some of those nine lives in these events.

782
00:57:39.88 --> 00:57:42.88
Didn't get a scratch.

783
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:43.88
Didn't get a scratch.

784
00:57:43.88 --> 00:57:52.88
I came up to the whole battle of the boulders and I was one of the first ones after the

785
00:57:52.88 --> 00:57:54.44
battle of the boulders.

786
00:57:54.44 --> 00:57:55.44
Think about it.

787
00:57:55.44 --> 00:58:01.96
One of the first ones to get leave to come home before the war is over.

788
00:58:01.96 --> 00:58:05.24
45 days.

789
00:58:05.24 --> 00:58:08.72
Unbelievable lucky.

790
00:58:08.72 --> 00:58:13.20
But I had a, it was on the point system.

791
00:58:13.20 --> 00:58:14.20
Right.

792
00:58:14.20 --> 00:58:16.20
I had 127 points.

793
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:17.92
And you were at the top of the list.

794
00:58:17.92 --> 00:58:19.84
That was off the top of the list.

795
00:58:19.84 --> 00:58:22.12
Because the points were based on how long you've been there.

796
00:58:22.12 --> 00:58:25.64
You've been in the service and all along overseas.

797
00:58:25.64 --> 00:58:26.64
Yeah.

798
00:58:26.64 --> 00:58:27.64
Yeah.

799
00:58:27.64 --> 00:58:28.64
Yeah.

800
00:58:28.64 --> 00:58:33.88
And before you even get to the battle of the boulds shortly after that, we moved through

801
00:58:33.88 --> 00:58:35.92
a narrow valley called the Phalays Gap.

802
00:58:35.92 --> 00:58:41.52
Phalays Gap, where we had a German army partially trapped.

803
00:58:41.52 --> 00:58:46.36
The English came in from the west while we came in from the southeast.

804
00:58:46.36 --> 00:58:48.000
Part of Patan's troops was there.

805
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Plus the five corps.

806
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.64
We captured 50,000 German soldiers and killed nearly that many.

807
00:58:53.64 --> 00:58:56.24
We've been barred to them from three sides when we got there.

808
00:58:56.24 --> 00:58:58.92
The shooting was over.

809
00:58:58.92 --> 00:59:03.72
That's the first time I ever walked over dead people and around dead horses.

810
00:59:03.72 --> 00:59:08.24
When we landed on Omaha Beach, I'd never stepped over any of our soldiers.

811
00:59:08.24 --> 00:59:10.88
That's like stepping on your brother.

812
00:59:10.88 --> 00:59:15.56
I didn't get the same feeling walking over the enemy.

813
00:59:15.56 --> 00:59:25.56
What was the feeling about Patan?

814
00:59:25.56 --> 00:59:26.84
Did you guys all know who he was?

815
00:59:26.84 --> 00:59:30.12
He was legendary back then for you guys?

816
00:59:30.12 --> 00:59:32.12
Well, Patan.

817
00:59:32.12 --> 00:59:41.12
Patan first Army was the one that landed on the day.

818
00:59:41.12 --> 00:59:43.12
First Army.

819
00:59:43.12 --> 00:59:51.16
Fifth Corps and 7th Corps were the two corps under First Army.

820
00:59:51.16 --> 00:59:57.56
Fifth Corps had Omaha Beach, all of Omaha Beach.

821
00:59:57.56 --> 01:00:03.80
I was the only operation sergeant in Fifth Corps, G3.

822
01:00:03.80 --> 01:00:15.08
So, take a look at this little farm boy from Hopen and Minnesota.

823
01:00:15.08 --> 01:00:16.48
Me, me, a school, please.

824
01:00:16.48 --> 01:00:20.44
100 occupants there.

825
01:00:20.44 --> 01:00:23.88
Farmers.

826
01:00:23.88 --> 01:00:26.72
Was in charge of that every night?

827
01:00:26.72 --> 01:00:29.24
Take a look.

828
01:00:29.24 --> 01:00:33.56
How is that possible?

829
01:00:33.56 --> 01:00:37.92
As Earl volunteered to do my chores for me.

830
01:00:37.92 --> 01:00:42.96
And I took typing one year.

831
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:46.000
It's crazy when you look back, haven't it?

832
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.88
It's plain crazy.

833
01:00:51.88 --> 01:00:55.48
It's hard for me to understand how.

834
01:00:55.48 --> 01:00:57.52
It's hard for me to be here.

835
01:00:57.52 --> 01:01:00.48
I'm going to be turning 99.

836
01:01:00.48 --> 01:01:05.32
I cannot believe that I am here.

837
01:01:05.32 --> 01:01:11.04
I'm the only one left of all the people I was in the service with.

838
01:01:11.04 --> 01:01:15.72
There's nobody else that I was in with alive.

839
01:01:15.72 --> 01:01:25.80
And sitting here, going to be 99, without an acrobat pain in my body, how is that possible?

840
01:01:25.80 --> 01:01:29.44
There's got to be an answer somehow.

841
01:01:29.44 --> 01:01:34.36
And I say, there is a God.

842
01:01:34.36 --> 01:01:38.000
That's my favorite saying, there is a God.

843
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.56
And he certainly looks out for you.

844
01:01:39.56 --> 01:01:40.56
That's for sure.

845
01:01:40.56 --> 01:01:45.16
He's been taking care of me great.

846
01:01:45.16 --> 01:01:52.88
The next thing that you did was to capture a Paris, the liberation of Paris.

847
01:01:52.88 --> 01:01:54.76
What was that like?

848
01:01:54.76 --> 01:02:04.28
There was another thing, the free French, when we came in, the Germans had gave up,

849
01:02:04.28 --> 01:02:08.60
the generals called off.

850
01:02:08.60 --> 01:02:10.44
He wasn't fight back.

851
01:02:10.44 --> 01:02:15.76
But the free French came in there and while the Germans were evacuating, they came in there

852
01:02:15.76 --> 01:02:24.44
and threw those maltoff cocktails into their trucks and everything.

853
01:02:24.44 --> 01:02:37.12
But if you had been treated like the French were treated for four years, I have a different

854
01:02:37.12 --> 01:02:40.40
view, see, come on in.

855
01:02:40.40 --> 01:02:45.04
I wasn't subject to any of the Germans or anything.

856
01:02:45.04 --> 01:02:47.56
We were just to fight them.

857
01:02:47.56 --> 01:02:59.52
So it was kind of hard for me to realize that these people suffered.

858
01:02:59.52 --> 01:03:09.52
There were thousands and thousands of them who were drafted and put into the army with

859
01:03:09.52 --> 01:03:13.12
the Germans.

860
01:03:13.12 --> 01:03:30.40
Being an American and with the liberties that we have, it's hard to transform your opinions

861
01:03:30.40 --> 01:03:38.000
when you're being killed and shot out and abused.

862
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.48
I just don't know how to put it.

863
01:03:42.48 --> 01:03:50.48
And you as a foreign boy from Hope, Minnesota ended up having a pretty nice office once

864
01:03:50.48 --> 01:03:52.88
you got in the general.

865
01:03:52.88 --> 01:03:54.88
Potent Marshall Potent.

866
01:03:54.88 --> 01:03:56.88
So often.

867
01:03:56.88 --> 01:04:03.000
How did things like this happen?

868
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.84
It's crazy.

869
01:04:04.84 --> 01:04:11.40
So Marshall Potent was the guy in charge of the Vicky French.

870
01:04:11.40 --> 01:04:12.40
The Vicky French.

871
01:04:12.40 --> 01:04:23.84
He was the one that went through the first war.

872
01:04:23.84 --> 01:04:30.52
I sat at his desk and it was loaded with metals of all kinds.

873
01:04:30.52 --> 01:04:40.04
Now the French gave me the legion of honor.

874
01:04:40.04 --> 01:04:50.56
In 1924, I would have the legion of honor.

875
01:04:50.56 --> 01:05:02.36
In 2015 February, we went to San Francisco to the French.

876
01:05:02.36 --> 01:05:07.28
There were officials there.

877
01:05:07.28 --> 01:05:16.16
There was ten of us that sat there and we were each present at what the legion of honor.

878
01:05:16.16 --> 01:05:33.16
Besides the legion of honor, I was the only one to receive the French retired soldier badge.

879
01:05:33.16 --> 01:05:41.000
I'm an honorary French retired soldier.

880
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.24
That's that little red white and blue one right there.

881
01:05:49.24 --> 01:05:55.48
It's one of the, I'm proud of that.

882
01:05:55.48 --> 01:05:56.48
The I'm being proud.

883
01:05:56.48 --> 01:06:06.44
I'm mostly proud to be American, but the French recognized that I had been working for

884
01:06:06.44 --> 01:06:13.08
them and gave me that long to legion of honor.

885
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:18.40
I don't know any other soldier in American Army.

886
01:06:18.40 --> 01:06:26.92
I have to receive that honor, retired French soldier.

887
01:06:26.92 --> 01:06:30.88
That's definitely an honor.

888
01:06:30.88 --> 01:06:38.000
Even as you say, the Germans kind of gave up Paris, but it wasn't over yet.

889
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.40
You had even more close calls.

890
01:06:40.40 --> 01:06:45.68
You say this here as if we moved out of Paris, we ended up in Luxembourg.

891
01:06:45.68 --> 01:06:49.48
As I work nights after I get some rest during the day, I'd have some free time to walk

892
01:06:49.48 --> 01:06:51.20
on the cobblestone streets.

893
01:06:51.20 --> 01:06:54.68
We were in a valley and I came to an intersection at the foot of a hill.

894
01:06:54.68 --> 01:07:00.04
I had just started crossing the road when an English spit fire and a German measure Schmidt

895
01:07:00.04 --> 01:07:03.48
right on its tail shot over the hill.

896
01:07:03.48 --> 01:07:07.08
The measure Schmidt firing its cannon at the spit fire.

897
01:07:07.08 --> 01:07:12.60
When they came down the hill, the cannon shot right in front of me, shattering the cobblestones

898
01:07:12.60 --> 01:07:14.000
into pieces.

899
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.80
I landed on my face in the cobblestones and got the hell out of there.

900
01:07:18.80 --> 01:07:27.12
Once again, it was unbelievable how lucky I was.

901
01:07:27.12 --> 01:07:28.12
I say this.

902
01:07:28.12 --> 01:07:36.40
Close only counts in horseshoe and grenades.

903
01:07:36.40 --> 01:07:40.80
You mentioned the battle the ball, Gerlier, on December 16th, at two in the morning, I was

904
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:44.84
on duty when a corporal drove up to the command post came in and reported.

905
01:07:44.84 --> 01:07:47.12
He was so excited that he saluted me.

906
01:07:47.12 --> 01:07:48.84
A staff sergeant.

907
01:07:48.84 --> 01:07:51.28
He declared I'm at guard post number six.

908
01:07:51.28 --> 01:07:54.20
And of course, we got out the operations map so I could see right where he was just

909
01:07:54.20 --> 01:07:57.44
south of Montshau.

910
01:07:57.44 --> 01:07:58.56
Montshau.

911
01:07:58.56 --> 01:08:01.32
He told me that the German pair of troops were coming down.

912
01:08:01.32 --> 01:08:03.60
I asked when you saw them coming down.

913
01:08:03.60 --> 01:08:04.60
What did you do?

914
01:08:04.60 --> 01:08:07.80
I got in the Jeep and came right here.

915
01:08:07.80 --> 01:08:11.44
So that was the beginning of the battle of the battle.

916
01:08:11.44 --> 01:08:23.04
The Germans had POWs, American POWs took their uniforms and then went out into this area

917
01:08:23.04 --> 01:08:28.04
and started changing the road signs and doing, they were spying and stuff and you talked

918
01:08:28.04 --> 01:08:35.88
about the fact that if you caught those people and those people were caught, they were shot.

919
01:08:35.88 --> 01:08:38.72
No trial was necessary for those men.

920
01:08:38.72 --> 01:08:40.52
This was in the material on the spot.

921
01:08:40.52 --> 01:08:50.44
And then the German tanks started to roll through.

922
01:08:50.44 --> 01:09:00.80
Now, Melmidi, the land lined up all these guys that were artillery observers.

923
01:09:00.80 --> 01:09:10.48
They caught, I take 180 of our guys who were caught there and lined up in the ditch with

924
01:09:10.48 --> 01:09:12.48
their hands over their head.

925
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:23.20
And it was snowing out the time when the German tanks rolled by and Colonel Fytherer

926
01:09:23.20 --> 01:09:27.76
of the who led the Germans at that time.

927
01:09:27.76 --> 01:09:34.76
And the soldier does tanks to fire their machine guns at these guys in the ditch.

928
01:09:34.76 --> 01:09:39.20
That's called Melmidi Massacre.

929
01:09:39.20 --> 01:09:43.08
Now, did you hear how long did it take for you to hear about that?

930
01:09:43.08 --> 01:09:45.08
Oh, I got it.

931
01:09:45.08 --> 01:09:47.72
But I don't know where.

932
01:09:47.72 --> 01:09:48.72
I'm about an hour.

933
01:09:48.72 --> 01:09:51.84
We're got back fast.

934
01:09:51.84 --> 01:09:56.72
We were caught off from the first army.

935
01:09:56.72 --> 01:10:04.24
When they went through there.

936
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:14.40
We ended up being part of General Montgomery's 21st Army group.

937
01:10:14.40 --> 01:10:20.04
And they talked about luck.

938
01:10:20.04 --> 01:10:25.52
Patten was, they ordered to get help from Patten from the third army.

939
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:36.48
That was a long way, but by the time Patten got there, Montgomery, we were part of Montgomery's

940
01:10:36.48 --> 01:10:38.000
21st Army group.

941
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Think of that.

942
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.84
We were the fifth corps.

943
01:10:41.84 --> 01:10:49.12
We're the only one that was part of Patten's 21st Army.

944
01:10:49.12 --> 01:11:00.56
And we had the first 29th, I think, or 28th division either one or those others at

945
01:11:00.56 --> 01:11:01.56
the time.

946
01:11:01.56 --> 01:11:03.72
There is a slip there.

947
01:11:03.72 --> 01:11:10.96
My mind is pretty full of stuff.

948
01:11:10.96 --> 01:11:14.88
But I can't tell you for sure, which one.

949
01:11:14.88 --> 01:11:21.40
But anyway, we put the squeeze out of the Germans from two sides.

950
01:11:21.40 --> 01:11:23.04
They had nowhere to go.

951
01:11:23.04 --> 01:11:27.44
It dropped their weapons and marched out.

952
01:11:27.44 --> 01:11:29.44
And they ran out of fuel to the other side.

953
01:11:29.44 --> 01:11:33.56
They left all of the vehicles right there.

954
01:11:33.56 --> 01:11:36.32
They walked out.

955
01:11:36.32 --> 01:11:39.68
I was reading some history about this.

956
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:42.52
And I guess six different occasions.

957
01:11:42.52 --> 01:11:50.52
This was Hitler's plan was to push through there.

958
01:11:50.52 --> 01:11:55.000
And six times his generals objected to the plan and said, this isn't a good idea.

959
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.32
We shouldn't do this.

960
01:11:56.32 --> 01:11:59.84
And six times he said, no, we're doing it anyways.

961
01:11:59.84 --> 01:12:00.84
Not listening.

962
01:12:00.84 --> 01:12:02.84
He was not listening to his subordinate.

963
01:12:02.84 --> 01:12:03.84
He had to push back.

964
01:12:03.84 --> 01:12:04.84
Did he ever?

965
01:12:04.84 --> 01:12:05.84
No.

966
01:12:05.84 --> 01:12:10.04
He just fired him.

967
01:12:10.04 --> 01:12:16.24
So as they pushed back, that battle, the battle of the bolds lasted almost a month and a

968
01:12:16.24 --> 01:12:17.96
half, something like that.

969
01:12:17.96 --> 01:12:22.52
I got out of there December 31st.

970
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:23.52
Okay.

971
01:12:23.52 --> 01:12:27.12
That's where we're like, I got 45 days leave.

972
01:12:27.12 --> 01:12:36.16
I'll tell you in a story of that.

973
01:12:36.16 --> 01:12:39.16
December 31st.

974
01:12:39.16 --> 01:12:46.16
Colonel Hill called me and said, I got a furlough for you.

975
01:12:46.16 --> 01:12:53.32
You're going to go home for 45 days.

976
01:12:53.32 --> 01:12:59.24
And so my God, I couldn't believe it.

977
01:12:59.24 --> 01:13:05.84
I had rifles and stuff under Colonel Hill's bed.

978
01:13:05.84 --> 01:13:12.76
Yeah, I had this truck that his bed never seemed to have seen that.

979
01:13:12.76 --> 01:13:15.32
And it was a good place to store stuff.

980
01:13:15.32 --> 01:13:19.16
So he didn't mind sleeping over.

981
01:13:19.16 --> 01:13:22.96
But I left that stuff over there.

982
01:13:22.96 --> 01:13:33.04
When I was going just on formalcy, I thought I'd be back to pick that up.

983
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:45.68
So it took me 51 days to get home.

984
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:47.84
And part of that was transporting wounded.

985
01:13:47.84 --> 01:13:49.96
Oh, we had it off on a ship.

986
01:13:49.96 --> 01:13:57.60
From the harbor, from the harbor to parts of us.

987
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:02.56
I think two or three ship loads abounded.

988
01:14:02.56 --> 01:14:10.20
So as you tried to leave, like we mentioned, like I mentioned earlier, there was 47,000 wounded

989
01:14:10.20 --> 01:14:11.80
during the battle of the bulge.

990
01:14:11.80 --> 01:14:17.40
So instead of the ships being able to take people home on furlough, you ended up on these

991
01:14:17.40 --> 01:14:21.40
ships getting people transported where back to England.

992
01:14:21.40 --> 01:14:25.84
Two, yeah, to parts of us.

993
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:29.68
Parts of us, things were which stopping.

994
01:14:29.68 --> 01:14:32.04
I'm loaded with ships again.

995
01:14:32.04 --> 01:14:36.28
Then go back and get another load, see.

996
01:14:36.28 --> 01:14:42.16
And here, I'm supposed to be headed across the Atlantic.

997
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:51.48
And think of this when I do get home.

998
01:14:51.48 --> 01:15:00.56
When I do get home and spend my 45 days at home, I go up to Fort Snelling and a captain

999
01:15:00.56 --> 01:15:05.80
called me and he's sergeant.

1000
01:15:05.80 --> 01:15:18.32
Ten minutes, ten minutes ago, I got a call from the Pentagon and they told me that they

1001
01:15:18.32 --> 01:15:25.52
let me, I could stay home or go back to Germany.

1002
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:29.08
My god, after three years over there, I bet.

1003
01:15:29.08 --> 01:15:32.52
There's no way I'm going back to Germany.

1004
01:15:32.52 --> 01:15:43.56
So all the relics that I had under Colonel Hill's bed, they were given up.

1005
01:15:43.56 --> 01:15:44.80
Don't know what happened.

1006
01:15:44.80 --> 01:15:50.04
And I don't miss some one of them.

1007
01:15:50.04 --> 01:16:01.72
So that's as you get home, I can't even imagine going from that many months of direct combat

1008
01:16:01.72 --> 01:16:05.16
and just getting on a ship, getting back to America.

1009
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:09.68
What was it like when you got home, especially before you found out that you were going

1010
01:16:09.68 --> 01:16:10.68
to get to stay home?

1011
01:16:10.68 --> 01:16:18.56
Oh, hey, my mother was dying from a heart to sea, he's called Leaky Chimdahart.

1012
01:16:18.56 --> 01:16:23.36
It was a bell in there.

1013
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:30.56
I never thought I'd see her anymore, but she was still living.

1014
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:35.20
And she lived for five years after that.

1015
01:16:35.20 --> 01:16:44.92
She saw her grandchildren, two of her grandchildren at that time.

1016
01:16:44.92 --> 01:16:57.40
I say there is a god, but two weeks after my mother passed away, Dr. Hoffnado in Washington,

1017
01:16:57.40 --> 01:17:01.44
D.C., in Venice that's valve.

1018
01:17:01.44 --> 01:17:06.12
That would have cured her.

1019
01:17:06.12 --> 01:17:15.60
But you can't turn that time.

1020
01:17:15.60 --> 01:17:17.40
It's like crying over spilled milk.

1021
01:17:17.40 --> 01:17:19.88
You can't pick it up.

1022
01:17:19.88 --> 01:17:25.20
It's done.

1023
01:17:25.20 --> 01:17:32.80
So was there anything else about the war when you were there like on a day to day basis?

1024
01:17:32.80 --> 01:17:37.28
How did you handle that?

1025
01:17:37.28 --> 01:17:41.32
You said when you were going to day, you weren't really afraid.

1026
01:17:41.32 --> 01:17:43.92
Then once you were getting that behind this bird.

1027
01:17:43.92 --> 01:17:48.08
Oh, okay, I was about to tell you what I'm doing here.

1028
01:17:48.08 --> 01:17:54.08
If you're in that position, you want to be able to fight back.

1029
01:17:54.08 --> 01:17:58.52
Well, there's no way you can fight back there.

1030
01:17:58.52 --> 01:18:04.76
They're protected from fire and you have to know exactly where they are, little hold

1031
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:06.80
they're shooting out of.

1032
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:18.32
It's pretty hard to determine when you're running for your life and dodging.

1033
01:18:18.32 --> 01:18:24.48
It's a circumstance you don't ever want to be in.

1034
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:28.72
But you're not the only one.

1035
01:18:28.72 --> 01:18:33.88
Major, you've got all the guys around you that are doing the same thing and some of them

1036
01:18:33.88 --> 01:18:35.88
being shot.

1037
01:18:35.88 --> 01:18:39.88
That'll spur you on a little bit too.

1038
01:18:39.88 --> 01:18:49.96
When somebody gets shot, puts a little bit of a unpassing you.

1039
01:18:49.96 --> 01:18:58.24
So when you get back and now you find out that they're going to discharge you.

1040
01:18:58.24 --> 01:19:00.20
You're done with the army.

1041
01:19:00.20 --> 01:19:04.12
You say that here you say, I was done.

1042
01:19:04.12 --> 01:19:08.20
That was April 13, 1945 and the war ended in May.

1043
01:19:08.20 --> 01:19:13.40
I was just 22 years old with seven years of soldering under my belt.

1044
01:19:13.40 --> 01:19:16.88
It's crazy when you think about that.

1045
01:19:16.88 --> 01:19:21.44
So that's it, the war's over for you.

1046
01:19:21.44 --> 01:19:25.16
And now it's, you start off by going back to farm life, right?

1047
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:33.36
Yeah, I've started helping my dad by rebuilding the hog shed, cementing and everything.

1048
01:19:33.36 --> 01:19:41.20
And then I started thinking, I'm going to have to have some kind of occupation.

1049
01:19:41.20 --> 01:19:48.20
They don't like the, they don't care about hiring somebody for just shooting people.

1050
01:19:48.20 --> 01:19:52.20
You know.

1051
01:19:52.20 --> 01:19:59.20
And so I enrolled in Dunno the Institute.

1052
01:19:59.20 --> 01:20:04.20
I took training in electricity.

1053
01:20:04.20 --> 01:20:11.20
I didn't.

1054
01:20:11.20 --> 01:20:11.20
Radio TV.

1055
01:20:11.20 --> 01:20:16.20
Anything to have to do with electricity.

1056
01:20:16.20 --> 01:20:19.20
I did.

1057
01:20:19.20 --> 01:20:28.20
And in fact, after I got out of there, I had my own service station for a while.

1058
01:20:28.20 --> 01:20:42.36
Man, have an asturvation, making a sent again.

1059
01:20:42.36 --> 01:20:49.36
And when they rebuild a highway alongside of you and no one can get in there, except from

1060
01:20:49.36 --> 01:20:52.56
the back streets.

1061
01:20:52.56 --> 01:20:59.44
And I said there were going to dump 30,000 yellows on me a month.

1062
01:20:59.44 --> 01:21:04.64
I told them to wear a shove that in service station.

1063
01:21:04.64 --> 01:21:14.20
And I went and got a job in Austin, Minnesota as a Lainman climbing poles that's

1064
01:21:14.20 --> 01:21:24.20
string and wire.

1065
01:21:24.20 --> 01:21:27.20
I did that for four years.

1066
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:29.20
I'm a journeyman lineman.

1067
01:21:29.20 --> 01:21:33.20
I got a journeyman license.

1068
01:21:33.20 --> 01:21:41.20
So Captain Erickson finally got his wish if you being up in the up.

1069
01:21:41.20 --> 01:21:48.80
You said you were going out in September 1945 soon thereafter we're going out every night.

1070
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:51.72
And October I got an engagement ring and asked her to marry me.

1071
01:21:51.72 --> 01:21:54.36
It seemed a wrap to me, but I was infatuated.

1072
01:21:54.36 --> 01:21:55.36
October went by.

1073
01:21:55.36 --> 01:21:56.84
Then November came along.

1074
01:21:56.84 --> 01:21:59.08
And I told Lola that it was killing me.

1075
01:21:59.08 --> 01:22:00.76
And that we had to do something about it.

1076
01:22:00.76 --> 01:22:05.52
We arranged to have a wedding at the Lutheran Church in Austin, where my sister peg and

1077
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:07.76
my brother-in-law lived.

1078
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:11.16
November 23rd, simple wedding.

1079
01:22:11.16 --> 01:22:19.68
She moved in and she and I slept in a closet on a bed no wider than a couch.

1080
01:22:19.68 --> 01:22:23.04
Worked out great for a while.

1081
01:22:23.04 --> 01:22:29.64
And plus we're lucky you don't take up much room.

1082
01:22:29.64 --> 01:22:34.44
You say this when I got home from the service, I had the shakes.

1083
01:22:34.44 --> 01:22:38.32
But nobody visited doctors for post traumatic stress disorder back then.

1084
01:22:38.32 --> 01:22:42.88
I woke up one night and I was choking Lola so we got separate beds.

1085
01:22:42.88 --> 01:22:44.84
She realized what I had gone through.

1086
01:22:44.84 --> 01:22:46.88
She was there for me 100%.

1087
01:22:46.88 --> 01:22:53.44
I had to learn how to drink coffee with my left hand because my right hand shook so much.

1088
01:22:53.44 --> 01:22:57.48
I started taking, was that propron on all?

1089
01:22:57.48 --> 01:22:59.32
Propron on all for that.

1090
01:22:59.32 --> 01:23:05.60
And still take it to this day.

1091
01:23:05.60 --> 01:23:08.88
So there's definitely even though you came home from the war.

1092
01:23:08.88 --> 01:23:13.72
The war was kind of still going on in some ways.

1093
01:23:13.72 --> 01:23:14.80
No, no, no, no, no.

1094
01:23:14.80 --> 01:23:20.08
World War II veterans had medical help like that.

1095
01:23:20.08 --> 01:23:28.16
In fact, when I wouldn't pick it, medical help.

1096
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:34.16
I had 11 cents in me.

1097
01:23:34.16 --> 01:23:36.16
11 in your heart.

1098
01:23:36.16 --> 01:23:41.16
Well, or I'm around your heart.

1099
01:23:41.16 --> 01:23:56.16
I was feeling faint and went down to the hospital and they were checking me out and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and they wanted to keep me overnight.

1100
01:23:56.16 --> 01:24:00.16
There is a God.

1101
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:14.16
I kept me in the hospital and hooked me up to tell you about things like wires all over me.

1102
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:22.16
The next morning, I woke up in the neighboring hospital instead of wall and a creek.

1103
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:27.16
Kaiser, I woke up in Mount Diablo.

1104
01:24:27.16 --> 01:24:37.16
And conquered 25 miles away at two o'clock in the morning.

1105
01:24:37.16 --> 01:24:39.16
That alarm went off.

1106
01:24:39.16 --> 01:24:42.16
I had cardiac arrest.

1107
01:24:42.16 --> 01:24:46.16
That means I was dead for a while.

1108
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:48.16
But you were hooked up to a machine.

1109
01:24:48.16 --> 01:24:49.16
The machine?

1110
01:24:49.16 --> 01:24:52.16
And they got to work on you immediately.

1111
01:24:52.16 --> 01:24:57.16
And got me.

1112
01:24:57.16 --> 01:24:58.16
Crazy.

1113
01:24:58.16 --> 01:24:59.16
You tell the story in here.

1114
01:24:59.16 --> 01:25:05.16
I mentioned that the picture earlier, that the major took of you while you were sitting in the Jeep.

1115
01:25:05.16 --> 01:25:09.16
And that picture got published in the newspaper.

1116
01:25:09.16 --> 01:25:15.16
And then you say this one day, I came home from work, finding Lola, changing her wallet.

1117
01:25:15.16 --> 01:25:18.16
She had all the remains of her old wallet dispersed across the table.

1118
01:25:18.16 --> 01:25:21.16
I walked by thinking nothing of it until something caught my eye.

1119
01:25:21.16 --> 01:25:25.16
I noticed a picture of a young soldier sitting inside an army Jeep.

1120
01:25:25.16 --> 01:25:27.16
But that wasn't just any soldier.

1121
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:29.16
That was me.

1122
01:25:29.16 --> 01:25:34.16
She had the picture of me and her wallet from years ago when I was in major Ridgeways Jeep.

1123
01:25:34.16 --> 01:25:37.16
The one that was in the local paper.

1124
01:25:37.16 --> 01:25:39.16
I asked her, where did you get that picture?

1125
01:25:39.16 --> 01:25:42.16
And she told me that she cut it out of the paper and put it in her wallet.

1126
01:25:42.16 --> 01:25:44.16
I said, you didn't even know me.

1127
01:25:44.16 --> 01:25:47.16
She said, no, but I met your brother Bob and he was in the hospital.

1128
01:25:47.16 --> 01:25:50.16
I said, you're brother Bob and he was talking about you.

1129
01:25:50.16 --> 01:25:53.16
At the time she was a sophomore going to high school.

1130
01:25:53.16 --> 01:25:56.16
Her family had just moved two farms north of us near Hope.

1131
01:25:56.16 --> 01:25:59.16
I never met her or her family and didn't even know she existed.

1132
01:25:59.16 --> 01:26:03.16
While she was in high school, one of her girlfriends questioned her for keeping the photo and asked,

1133
01:26:03.16 --> 01:26:05.16
who's the guy in this picture?

1134
01:26:05.16 --> 01:26:10.16
She announced, that is the guy I am going to marry.

1135
01:26:10.16 --> 01:26:13.16
How can you make up something like that?

1136
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:18.16
My life is unbelievable.

1137
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:23.16
I'm telling them, and it keeps on going unbelievable.

1138
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:29.16
So you have your first son, Kurt, in 1948.

1139
01:26:29.16 --> 01:26:32.16
You end up with that line-min job.

1140
01:26:32.16 --> 01:26:36.16
You have your second child, Linda.

1141
01:26:36.16 --> 01:26:42.16
And then you go, you become a TV, radio repairman after you do the service stage.

1142
01:26:42.16 --> 01:26:45.16
You end up moving to California.

1143
01:26:45.16 --> 01:26:51.16
When you get to California, you're working for seers as a TV repairman for $2.35

1144
01:26:51.16 --> 01:26:52.16
an hour.

1145
01:26:52.16 --> 01:26:57.16
Your brother-in-law has a print shop up in Northern California.

1146
01:26:57.16 --> 01:27:02.16
He offers you a hefty raise up to $3.42 an hour.

1147
01:27:02.16 --> 01:27:05.16
And you go up there and do that.

1148
01:27:05.16 --> 01:27:09.16
You end up also doing TV repair on the side.

1149
01:27:09.16 --> 01:27:12.16
Working with replacing people's tubes and one knot.

1150
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:16.16
So now it's years go by.

1151
01:27:16.16 --> 01:27:19.16
And you say this while working for my brother-in-law,

1152
01:27:19.16 --> 01:27:22.16
I'd come home about 3-30 or 4 every day.

1153
01:27:22.16 --> 01:27:24.16
And then worked fixing televisions.

1154
01:27:24.16 --> 01:27:25.16
One particular day I'll never forget.

1155
01:27:25.16 --> 01:27:28.16
I came home from the print shop and Lola met me at the door.

1156
01:27:28.16 --> 01:27:30.16
I said, hi, Han.

1157
01:27:30.16 --> 01:27:32.16
Don't harm me.

1158
01:27:32.16 --> 01:27:34.16
You son of a gun.

1159
01:27:34.16 --> 01:27:39.16
You're a fucking bitch.

1160
01:27:39.16 --> 01:27:41.16
Wow, that shook me up.

1161
01:27:41.16 --> 01:27:42.16
What's the problem, honey?

1162
01:27:42.16 --> 01:27:43.16
The problem is I'm pregnant.

1163
01:27:43.16 --> 01:27:44.16
You son of a bitch.

1164
01:27:44.16 --> 01:27:45.16
Yeah.

1165
01:27:45.16 --> 01:27:46.16
It's pregnant.

1166
01:27:46.16 --> 01:27:48.16
You'd better get the doctor to make sure.

1167
01:27:48.16 --> 01:27:51.16
Well, the reason she was, because this is what, ten years after your last kid?

1168
01:27:51.16 --> 01:27:52.16
Yeah.

1169
01:27:52.16 --> 01:27:54.16
Ten years.

1170
01:27:54.16 --> 01:27:57.16
It's not like ten years.

1171
01:27:57.16 --> 01:28:01.16
So that's, you end up having another baby.

1172
01:28:01.16 --> 01:28:02.16
Yeah.

1173
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:04.16
You go to it.

1174
01:28:04.16 --> 01:28:07.16
And there is a god.

1175
01:28:07.16 --> 01:28:09.16
You work at Jonas printing.

1176
01:28:09.16 --> 01:28:14.16
You work at Harrington, McGinnis printing for a while.

1177
01:28:14.16 --> 01:28:18.16
You end up getting a house.

1178
01:28:18.16 --> 01:28:20.16
Here's a conversation.

1179
01:28:20.16 --> 01:28:23.16
In 1990 we were still living in Pleasant Hill, California.

1180
01:28:23.16 --> 01:28:28.16
As usual, it went to, I still went to the free market every Sunday in January.

1181
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:33.16
And now I'm going to talk to you.

1182
01:28:33.16 --> 01:28:36.16
The first word out of her mouth, I knew I didn't have a chance.

1183
01:28:36.16 --> 01:28:38.16
I knew I was screwed.

1184
01:28:38.16 --> 01:28:41.16
She looked at me and said, father, I found my dream house.

1185
01:28:41.16 --> 01:28:43.16
Yeah, father.

1186
01:28:43.16 --> 01:28:45.16
Melted me.

1187
01:28:45.16 --> 01:28:48.16
So what do you mean by dream house?

1188
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:51.16
A house we can live in with my two sons and their families.

1189
01:28:51.16 --> 01:28:53.16
I want you to come look at it.

1190
01:28:53.16 --> 01:28:56.16
All I could think was, man, this is going to cost me a lot.

1191
01:28:56.16 --> 01:29:01.16
So you say the place was going to take a lot of work.

1192
01:29:01.16 --> 01:29:08.16
So it seemed ridiculous to me to buy a new home when I was in my late 60s because I didn't know how long I'd be living.

1193
01:29:08.16 --> 01:29:10.16
But you end up buying the house.

1194
01:29:10.16 --> 01:29:15.16
Lowly moved into the house in Martinez during the construction renovations.

1195
01:29:15.16 --> 01:29:17.16
Followed by Carlin and Kim then Kurt.

1196
01:29:17.16 --> 01:29:22.16
Linda wasn't interested in moving in because she already had a home with her husband and family.

1197
01:29:22.16 --> 01:29:25.16
I lived in Pleasant Hill while our house was up for sale.

1198
01:29:25.16 --> 01:29:31.16
The housing market was slow at the time because the interest rate was at 12%.

1199
01:29:31.16 --> 01:29:35.16
While I stayed at Pleasant Hill, the house in Martinez really came together.

1200
01:29:35.16 --> 01:29:37.16
All of Lowly's ideas coming to life.

1201
01:29:37.16 --> 01:29:40.16
I was starting to see what she saw in that house.

1202
01:29:40.16 --> 01:29:43.16
So you end up with a compound for the family.

1203
01:29:43.16 --> 01:29:44.16
Yes.

1204
01:29:44.16 --> 01:29:49.16
And it kept me alive.

1205
01:29:49.16 --> 01:29:54.16
I have another incident where I couldn't get out of bed in the house.

1206
01:29:54.16 --> 01:29:56.16
I had a bed in the morning.

1207
01:29:56.16 --> 01:30:02.16
I went off a radio just a radio came on.

1208
01:30:02.16 --> 01:30:03.16
Loud.

1209
01:30:03.16 --> 01:30:10.16
And I'm laying there thinking like right here right now.

1210
01:30:10.16 --> 01:30:15.16
As my mind was as sharp as it is right now.

1211
01:30:15.16 --> 01:30:20.16
But I could move a muscle.

1212
01:30:20.16 --> 01:30:26.16
I had a telephone rental on the side of me.

1213
01:30:26.16 --> 01:30:30.16
To call my kids.

1214
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:34.16
I couldn't move unless I had a little muscle.

1215
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:36.16
Do you know?

1216
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:38.16
Yes.

1217
01:30:38.16 --> 01:30:41.16
Your bladder starts talking to you.

1218
01:30:41.16 --> 01:30:44.16
Get me to the bathroom.

1219
01:30:44.16 --> 01:30:49.16
Or you're going to be sorry.

1220
01:30:49.16 --> 01:30:55.16
And the next thing I knew, my older son came down from upstairs.

1221
01:30:55.16 --> 01:31:01.16
And he says, the radio was going.

1222
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:05.16
He says, Dad, I've got a problem.

1223
01:31:05.16 --> 01:31:11.16
Kurt, I can't move.

1224
01:31:11.16 --> 01:31:14.16
I've got to get to the bathroom.

1225
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:18.16
He says, I'll go get the car on.

1226
01:31:18.16 --> 01:31:25.16
So when they started moving me, I passed out.

1227
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:34.16
The next thing I knew I was woke up in Kaiser Warrner Creek.

1228
01:31:34.16 --> 01:31:41.16
I had a stroke.

1229
01:31:41.16 --> 01:31:47.16
And they said, if I'd have been any later, it would have affected me.

1230
01:31:47.16 --> 01:31:54.16
Right now I have a little.

1231
01:31:54.16 --> 01:32:02.16
I kind of, well, my left side.

1232
01:32:02.16 --> 01:32:08.16
My left hand.

1233
01:32:08.16 --> 01:32:13.16
It's wrinkled in there.

1234
01:32:13.16 --> 01:32:18.16
I left foot.

1235
01:32:18.16 --> 01:32:23.16
I kind of dragged my left foot.

1236
01:32:23.16 --> 01:32:27.16
But the Ruzzy God, I'll tell you about it.

1237
01:32:27.16 --> 01:32:30.16
Does it hurt me?

1238
01:32:30.16 --> 01:32:34.16
My mind complete.

1239
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:40.16
So while you were living in pleasant hill, you got to call.

1240
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:42.16
One day, Lola called me and said, Father, I want you to come down there and stay with you.

1241
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:46.16
I'll get along the way, bed.

1242
01:32:46.16 --> 01:32:50.16
He even talked about that in me.

1243
01:32:50.16 --> 01:32:56.16
She said I'm losing too much weight because I miss your kid cooking.

1244
01:32:56.16 --> 01:32:57.16
I asked how much weight she lost.

1245
01:32:57.16 --> 01:33:00.16
I lost 40 pounds last month.

1246
01:33:00.16 --> 01:33:05.16
40 pounds.

1247
01:33:05.16 --> 01:33:10.16
You say they found out she had stomach cancer.

1248
01:33:10.16 --> 01:33:11.16
I'm sorry, Dad.

1249
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:12.16
Linda said they're going to operate.

1250
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:14.16
They think they can get it all.

1251
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:17.16
They might have to take somewhere stomach out, but she can live a normal life.

1252
01:33:17.16 --> 01:33:19.16
She would have to eat less, but more often.

1253
01:33:19.16 --> 01:33:26.16
I just wanted anything and everything done for her to keep going.

1254
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:29.16
The doctors opened her up discovering that it had spread to her intestines.

1255
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:34.16
They gave her six weeks to live, but she lived a little longer than expected.

1256
01:33:34.16 --> 01:33:39.16
Curtin Carlin fixed up the room in the house that looked towards Mount Diablo, so she could look out the window

1257
01:33:39.16 --> 01:33:40.16
and enjoy the view.

1258
01:33:40.16 --> 01:33:43.16
One of the last things she saw was that view.

1259
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:54.16
It's a beautiful sight.

1260
01:33:54.16 --> 01:34:03.16
A day doesn't go by when I don't think if you're knowing that she's guiding me.

1261
01:34:03.16 --> 01:34:06.16
She wrote a poem about me.

1262
01:34:06.16 --> 01:34:10.16
She never was my tom poetry, but low love to write.

1263
01:34:10.16 --> 01:34:16.16
She titled the poem One of a Lucky.

1264
01:34:16.16 --> 01:34:24.16
My husband was one of many a second world war volunteer, who left home to go serve his country,

1265
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:28.16
this land that we all love so dear.

1266
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:30.16
He never complained.

1267
01:34:30.16 --> 01:34:34.16
He was lonesome, surrounded by enemy guns.

1268
01:34:34.16 --> 01:34:39.16
The letters he wrote, home were cheerful, like the battle was only fun.

1269
01:34:39.16 --> 01:34:44.16
In his foxhole there, death sat beside him, with shells whistling over his head.

1270
01:34:44.16 --> 01:34:49.16
He tried to remember his childhood, tucked safely away in his bed.

1271
01:34:49.16 --> 01:34:55.16
His buddies they fell by the dozen on the beach their lives, abbing away.

1272
01:34:55.16 --> 01:35:02.16
In my heart, I think God had watched over him when he made it to cover that day.

1273
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:06.16
Time and again he was lucky.

1274
01:35:06.16 --> 01:35:10.16
He still ran when his best buddies fell,

1275
01:35:10.16 --> 01:35:17.16
adodging and jumping and dying in this man-made inferno to hell.

1276
01:35:17.16 --> 01:35:24.16
But the day came when his nerves had shattered, and the general so plainly could see.

1277
01:35:24.16 --> 01:35:31.16
This boy should no longer see battle, so they sent him home safely to me.

1278
01:35:31.16 --> 01:35:34.16
To me.

1279
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:39.16
Beautiful poem.

1280
01:35:51.16 --> 01:35:56.16
Six me up. Six me up.

1281
01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:07.16
Well, you were very lucky, not just to avoid machine guns and bombs and everything else.

1282
01:36:07.16 --> 01:36:14.16
You were also very lucky that you met your beautiful wife, and you were able to spend so much time with her.

1283
01:36:14.16 --> 01:36:19.16
I tell you, somebody up there like, shmai.

1284
01:36:19.16 --> 01:36:31.16
I can't fear it out. Somebody must like me or like what I do things.

1285
01:36:31.16 --> 01:36:35.16
Even after Lola died, you kept working.

1286
01:36:35.16 --> 01:36:39.16
Then finally in 1995, when you were 73, your boy said,

1287
01:36:39.16 --> 01:36:42.16
Dad, we don't want your work anymore.

1288
01:36:42.16 --> 01:36:48.16
You retired after working for 19 years at Harrington McGinnis.

1289
01:36:48.16 --> 01:36:51.16
But then you still kept schedule.

1290
01:36:51.16 --> 01:36:54.16
So how old were you in your retired of 73?

1291
01:36:54.16 --> 01:37:00.16
But you'd run errands and cook for the family,

1292
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:05.16
taking the kids all over the place to different schools and stuff.

1293
01:37:05.16 --> 01:37:10.16
Had to stay focused, had a new mission.

1294
01:37:10.16 --> 01:37:13.16
I had a new responsibility in life.

1295
01:37:13.16 --> 01:37:17.16
I had a granddaughter.

1296
01:37:17.16 --> 01:37:22.16
Who was three when I was 73?

1297
01:37:22.16 --> 01:37:27.16
And I became the sole razor of her.

1298
01:37:27.16 --> 01:37:30.16
She's a dancer on a cruise ship.

1299
01:37:30.16 --> 01:37:32.16
No, a dancer singer.

1300
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:39.16
And she is the one responsible for putting me on TikTok.

1301
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:42.16
I would not be here right now.

1302
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:49.16
She's mostly responsible for this book.

1303
01:37:49.16 --> 01:37:58.16
It's unbelievable.

1304
01:37:58.16 --> 01:37:59.16
It is unbelievable.

1305
01:37:59.16 --> 01:38:03.16
Luckily you're sitting here to see that it is believable.

1306
01:38:03.16 --> 01:38:04.16
Yes.

1307
01:38:04.16 --> 01:38:06.16
It's crazy.

1308
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:09.16
Crazy.

1309
01:38:09.16 --> 01:38:13.16
You know, you were a little earlier in the book.

1310
01:38:13.16 --> 01:38:16.16
You were talking about having the shakes in your hand.

1311
01:38:16.16 --> 01:38:20.16
Then you say, I came out of World War II with the shakes in my right arm.

1312
01:38:20.16 --> 01:38:23.16
I couldn't pick up a cup of coffee without shaking.

1313
01:38:23.16 --> 01:38:24.16
Without my hands shaking.

1314
01:38:24.16 --> 01:38:26.16
So I learned a drink with my left hand.

1315
01:38:26.16 --> 01:38:30.16
I took medication for it, but it didn't alleviate it completely.

1316
01:38:30.16 --> 01:38:33.16
And then one time you fell down.

1317
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:36.16
And when you fell down, you went to the hospital.

1318
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:41.16
You got 30 stitches in your head.

1319
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:46.16
And 29 stitches in your right hand.

1320
01:38:46.16 --> 01:38:53.16
You went to the bunch of MRIs and whatnot.

1321
01:38:53.16 --> 01:38:56.16
Before you went in the MRI machine, I got to read this part.

1322
01:38:56.16 --> 01:39:00.16
You said, I got down to the MRI room and the guy who was operating the MRI machine said,

1323
01:39:00.16 --> 01:39:02.16
I asked you a few questions before I put you in the machine.

1324
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:04.16
I replied, go right ahead.

1325
01:39:04.16 --> 01:39:07.16
Yes, me as a series of questions. Like what year is it?

1326
01:39:07.16 --> 01:39:10.16
Etc. etc. Then he asked, are you pregnant?

1327
01:39:10.16 --> 01:39:13.16
I answered, I've been screwed so many times.

1328
01:39:13.16 --> 01:39:16.16
I ought to be.

1329
01:39:16.16 --> 01:39:18.16
Well, the MRI came back with that in any problems,

1330
01:39:18.16 --> 01:39:23.16
but you the shake went away after after 70 years.

1331
01:39:23.16 --> 01:39:25.16
No, no, no, no.

1332
01:39:25.16 --> 01:39:29.16
We're sitting here. I want you to look at this.

1333
01:39:29.16 --> 01:39:32.16
I could be an eye doctor.

1334
01:39:32.16 --> 01:39:35.16
Absolutely.

1335
01:39:35.16 --> 01:39:39.16
I couldn't hold it.

1336
01:39:39.16 --> 01:39:39.16
I couldn't hold it.

1337
01:39:39.16 --> 01:39:41.16
I cut the coffee in that hand.

1338
01:39:41.16 --> 01:39:47.16
Before I fell on my left side and left side right hand.

1339
01:39:47.16 --> 01:39:49.16
It correlates.

1340
01:39:49.16 --> 01:39:50.16
It's a miracle.

1341
01:39:50.16 --> 01:39:53.16
I am a miracle.

1342
01:39:53.16 --> 01:39:55.16
It's crazy.

1343
01:39:55.16 --> 01:39:58.16
And so, let you end up getting cataracts surgery.

1344
01:39:58.16 --> 01:40:00.16
You've been color blind your whole life.

1345
01:40:00.16 --> 01:40:02.16
What happens after cataracts surgery?

1346
01:40:02.16 --> 01:40:05.16
I get my color vision back.

1347
01:40:05.16 --> 01:40:08.16
On Easter Sunday.

1348
01:40:08.16 --> 01:40:11.16
Easter Sunday.

1349
01:40:11.16 --> 01:40:13.16
Crazy.

1350
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:15.16
So you can see color now.

1351
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:16.16
She color now.

1352
01:40:16.16 --> 01:40:18.16
You are color blind your whole life.

1353
01:40:18.16 --> 01:40:23.16
You see all these colors?

1354
01:40:23.16 --> 01:40:27.16
I can't tell you what color that is.

1355
01:40:27.16 --> 01:40:30.16
But it's kind of an orangey red.

1356
01:40:30.16 --> 01:40:33.16
Yes, it is.

1357
01:40:33.16 --> 01:40:36.16
And that's a blue.

1358
01:40:36.16 --> 01:40:38.16
Yes, it is.

1359
01:40:38.16 --> 01:40:43.16
But I see all these colors.

1360
01:40:43.16 --> 01:40:51.16
I don't know the names of them because I was brought up without colors.

1361
01:40:51.16 --> 01:40:53.16
I'm believable.

1362
01:40:53.16 --> 01:40:55.16
It's crazy.

1363
01:40:55.16 --> 01:41:03.16
And you mentioned earlier going over being having the opportunity to go to the 75th anniversary

1364
01:41:03.16 --> 01:41:04.16
of D Day.

1365
01:41:04.16 --> 01:41:11.16
Part of that was because of a donations on a go fund me to get you sent over there.

1366
01:41:11.16 --> 01:41:16.16
That's a very interesting thing.

1367
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:24.16
Because all my service records were burned up in Kentucky in 1973.

1368
01:41:24.16 --> 01:41:29.16
The elves and the ems were burned up.

1369
01:41:29.16 --> 01:41:40.16
So I don't know if I put this in about one middle of the month.

1370
01:41:40.16 --> 01:41:45.16
I did get the bronze star.

1371
01:41:45.16 --> 01:41:52.16
Or Earl Heeps was a newcomer to the bagel shop group.

1372
01:41:52.16 --> 01:41:59.16
And he was a sergeant in Korea.

1373
01:41:59.16 --> 01:42:05.16
And he says, you ever give any medals, Jake?

1374
01:42:05.16 --> 01:42:08.16
Yeah, I got the bronze star.

1375
01:42:08.16 --> 01:42:13.16
He's bringing it in.

1376
01:42:13.16 --> 01:42:17.16
I've never seen the bronze star.

1377
01:42:17.16 --> 01:42:27.16
We had just moved from pleasant hill into our home in Martinez.

1378
01:42:27.16 --> 01:42:32.16
So I looked for that bronze star.

1379
01:42:32.16 --> 01:42:35.16
I could not find it.

1380
01:42:35.16 --> 01:42:38.16
I looked every place.

1381
01:42:38.16 --> 01:42:40.16
Where would I go?

1382
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:43.16
What happened to that thing?

1383
01:42:43.16 --> 01:42:49.16
Then my daughter said, Linda said, that don't worry about the office.

1384
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:54.16
I'll just write to the army and have it replaced.

1385
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:56.16
I said, you can do that.

1386
01:42:56.16 --> 01:42:57.16
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:42:57.16 --> 01:42:59.16
They'll replace it for you.

1388
01:42:59.16 --> 01:43:07.16
So I went up and told Earl Heeps that I couldn't find it.

1389
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:12.16
They were going to replace it.

1390
01:43:12.16 --> 01:43:28.16
A month later, Linda came to me and says, dad, they don't know anything about your bronze star.

1391
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:33.16
They all your records were burned in Kentucky.

1392
01:43:33.16 --> 01:43:38.16
And they don't even know if you served in the service.

1393
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:42.16
They're going to be dead.

1394
01:43:42.16 --> 01:43:47.16
Man, that's a shaker upper.

1395
01:43:47.16 --> 01:43:55.16
So I tried to find out, and man, I'm a GI.

1396
01:43:55.16 --> 01:43:58.16
Three years overseas.

1397
01:43:58.16 --> 01:44:07.16
I don't even have VA help for doctor or anything.

1398
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:14.16
And it's probably a damn good thing because I'm still alive.

1399
01:44:14.16 --> 01:44:23.16
I don't take data to give this love and sense to me in the VA.

1400
01:44:23.16 --> 01:44:27.16
But they ended up raising money for you and you found your bronze star.

1401
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:28.16
It's in the book.

1402
01:44:28.16 --> 01:44:30.16
You found your bronze star.

1403
01:44:30.16 --> 01:44:35.16
I can tell you about this.

1404
01:44:35.16 --> 01:44:43.16
And I went back and told Earl Heeps that my bronze star was lost.

1405
01:44:43.16 --> 01:44:49.16
And they told me, we don't even know if you served in the service.

1406
01:44:49.16 --> 01:44:53.16
And Earl Heeps says, well, we don't have to believe in them.

1407
01:44:53.16 --> 01:45:03.16
I'm telling you, you've been telling us, man, that's a stabber.

1408
01:45:03.16 --> 01:45:05.16
But you did find the bronze star.

1409
01:45:05.16 --> 01:45:07.16
Oh, we found a bronze.

1410
01:45:07.16 --> 01:45:11.16
We didn't all damn okay and there's something.

1411
01:45:11.16 --> 01:45:15.16
And I'm an ammunition box.

1412
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:18.16
And here's irony to think.

1413
01:45:18.16 --> 01:45:21.16
It was some 40 caliber ammunition.

1414
01:45:21.16 --> 01:45:23.16
And I asked who wanted that ammunition.

1415
01:45:23.16 --> 01:45:25.16
I didn't want that around.

1416
01:45:25.16 --> 01:45:28.16
I had some handguns that fit.

1417
01:45:28.16 --> 01:45:33.16
And I've got too many grandchildren.

1418
01:45:33.16 --> 01:45:37.16
So Earl Heeps says, I'll take it.

1419
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:39.16
I've got some here.

1420
01:45:39.16 --> 01:45:41.16
Earl Heeps.

1421
01:45:41.16 --> 01:45:46.16
The one who told me, we don't have to believe a damn thing you told us.

1422
01:45:46.16 --> 01:45:54.16
I opened that ammunition box and there that bronze star was laying in the box right on top.

1423
01:45:54.16 --> 01:45:58.16
I don't remember putting it on in there.

1424
01:45:58.16 --> 01:46:01.16
And no one else did, too.

1425
01:46:01.16 --> 01:46:09.16
But when I could produce the bronze star, Earl had to eat it.

1426
01:46:09.16 --> 01:46:10.16
He did.

1427
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:12.16
He had to eat his words.

1428
01:46:12.16 --> 01:46:14.16
Did I say, look.

1429
01:46:14.16 --> 01:46:15.16
Yeah.

1430
01:46:15.16 --> 01:46:18.16
He did.

1431
01:46:18.16 --> 01:46:20.16
So you raised the money.

1432
01:46:20.16 --> 01:46:22.16
You end up going to Normandy.

1433
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:26.16
And you talked about this, but I just want to read this section because it's so moving.

1434
01:46:26.16 --> 01:46:30.16
You say we drove straight from Paris to Normandy to the American cemetery.

1435
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.16
The first grave I saw was a private from the first infantry division.

1436
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:39.16
That choked me up because I went on in on D day with members of the first infantry division.

1437
01:46:39.16 --> 01:46:43.16
And now I was looking down at his grave 75 years later.

1438
01:46:43.16 --> 01:46:45.16
It's kind of a weird feeling.

1439
01:46:45.16 --> 01:46:47.16
I made it.

1440
01:46:47.16 --> 01:46:51.16
And he didn't look at the family I have while he has nothing.

1441
01:46:51.16 --> 01:46:54.16
War is so unfair.

1442
01:46:54.16 --> 01:46:58.16
I took off my hat, thanking him for paving the way for me.

1443
01:46:58.16 --> 01:47:01.16
I teared up and walked away.

1444
01:47:01.16 --> 01:47:06.16
I never realized the cemetery had over 9,000 Americans.

1445
01:47:06.16 --> 01:47:09.16
I was never one for visiting cemeteries.

1446
01:47:09.16 --> 01:47:14.16
There are souls still hanging around, but this visit was different.

1447
01:47:14.16 --> 01:47:23.16
I owed it to those who had been killed to pay my respects.

1448
01:47:23.16 --> 01:47:30.16
And as you mentioned earlier, you ended up doing a bunch of interviews for French TV and CBS.

1449
01:47:30.16 --> 01:47:42.16
I got to add to one that you'll never hear anybody else say.

1450
01:47:42.16 --> 01:47:53.16
From Russia, from Moscow, a young girl came up to me after the five.

1451
01:47:53.16 --> 01:48:00.16
I was one who came up and said, I'm from Moscow, Russia.

1452
01:48:00.16 --> 01:48:03.16
And I'd like to interview you.

1453
01:48:03.16 --> 01:48:08.16
Perfect English.

1454
01:48:08.16 --> 01:48:16.16
I've never heard that anyone being interviewed from anybody from Russia.

1455
01:48:16.16 --> 01:48:25.16
It's crazy.

1456
01:48:25.16 --> 01:48:29.16
You also went back to Omaha Beach itself.

1457
01:48:29.16 --> 01:48:36.16
You say here, I returned to a section of Omaha Beach where I walked on the sand for the first time in 75 years with my family and abuse groups.

1458
01:48:36.16 --> 01:48:39.16
I found it.

1459
01:48:39.16 --> 01:48:43.16
I was...

1460
01:48:43.16 --> 01:48:48.16
I tell you, it's hard for me to talk about it.

1461
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:57.16
You can't imagine what were the memories that come back to you.

1462
01:48:57.16 --> 01:49:07.16
And here I'm standing there with my son, my two sons.

1463
01:49:07.16 --> 01:49:12.16
Because you ended up seeing a bomb that was basically exactly what that had been.

1464
01:49:12.16 --> 01:49:18.16
It's like it was recreated for me.

1465
01:49:18.16 --> 01:49:25.16
How is that possible?

1466
01:49:25.16 --> 01:49:32.16
They had a big ceremony.

1467
01:49:32.16 --> 01:49:36.16
You took the president's hand at the ceremony.

1468
01:49:36.16 --> 01:49:39.16
Yeah, president Cropes hand.

1469
01:49:39.16 --> 01:49:44.16
It did a bunch more interviews.

1470
01:49:44.16 --> 01:49:50.16
And you say this, the D-Day anniversary trip was the trip of a lifetime that I will never forget.

1471
01:49:50.16 --> 01:49:55.16
What a moving memory surpassing D-Day in my mind.

1472
01:49:55.16 --> 01:49:57.16
There was no killing.

1473
01:49:57.16 --> 01:49:58.16
And we were celebrating.

1474
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:00.16
It was the epitome of my life.

1475
01:50:00.16 --> 01:50:04.16
I'm so grateful for all the people who came together in order for me to make it back there.

1476
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:08.16
I never in my life thought I would return to that beach, but I'm glad that I did.

1477
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:11.16
I did not return for myself.

1478
01:50:11.16 --> 01:50:18.16
But instead for my fellow soldiers who did not make it.

1479
01:50:18.16 --> 01:50:24.16
And all those interviews that you did, the word spread, you ended up hearing from a corporal Madison rich.

1480
01:50:24.16 --> 01:50:28.16
You ended up hearing kids.

1481
01:50:28.16 --> 01:50:33.16
About the gun incident breaking into...

1482
01:50:33.16 --> 01:50:39.16
Man, he told his children about that.

1483
01:50:39.16 --> 01:50:44.16
I never had much contact.

1484
01:50:44.16 --> 01:50:47.16
We were working when we...

1485
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:48.16
We got on our service.

1486
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:54.16
We didn't have time for messing around.

1487
01:50:54.16 --> 01:50:58.16
Talking about what we did in the service.

1488
01:50:58.16 --> 01:51:08.16
But after he passed away, his wife contacted me.

1489
01:51:08.16 --> 01:51:13.16
And I kept in contact with her for the years.

1490
01:51:13.16 --> 01:51:18.16
And then she passed away.

1491
01:51:18.16 --> 01:51:21.16
And man, all of a sudden I'm over in Europe.

1492
01:51:21.16 --> 01:51:30.16
I'm in Europe celebrating the 75th anniversary of D.D.

1493
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:35.16
And in New York.

1494
01:51:35.16 --> 01:51:46.16
I'm a man there.

1495
01:51:46.16 --> 01:51:49.16
He calls his brother in New Jersey.

1496
01:51:49.16 --> 01:51:54.16
He says, Frank, are you watching that thing about D.D.

1497
01:51:54.16 --> 01:51:56.16
The 75th anniversary?

1498
01:51:56.16 --> 01:51:59.16
Yeah, he says, I am.

1499
01:51:59.16 --> 01:52:03.16
I wonder if that Jake Larson there talking about.

1500
01:52:03.16 --> 01:52:08.16
It's the same one dad used to talk about when the rifle broke into.

1501
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:13.16
And he was laid this rifle under.

1502
01:52:13.16 --> 01:52:17.16
So they got a whole of my youngest son, Carlon.

1503
01:52:17.16 --> 01:52:24.16
He's kind of takes care of all my appointments and things.

1504
01:52:24.16 --> 01:52:28.16
And they called him.

1505
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:29.16
And he's...

1506
01:52:29.16 --> 01:52:35.16
So, some, hey, I wonder if that Jake Larson is the same guy that my dad was talking to him.

1507
01:52:35.16 --> 01:52:39.16
Carlon said, well, what's your dad's name?

1508
01:52:39.16 --> 01:52:41.16
He says, Madison Rich.

1509
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:44.16
Carlon said, that's the same one.

1510
01:52:44.16 --> 01:52:49.16
I personally got in contact.

1511
01:52:49.16 --> 01:52:54.16
Those two girls and two boys of Madison Rich.

1512
01:52:54.16 --> 01:53:02.16
Contacted at me. We talked on the phone, face to face.

1513
01:53:02.16 --> 01:53:07.16
And the oldest boy came down and saw me personally.

1514
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:11.16
What a wonderful thing.

1515
01:53:11.16 --> 01:53:13.16
What a wonderful thing.

1516
01:53:13.16 --> 01:53:20.16
Madison Rich did not make 70 years old.

1517
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:24.16
My God, I worked a little 73.

1518
01:53:24.16 --> 01:53:30.16
And here I sit going on 99.

1519
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:35.16
There's something wrong in the equation.

1520
01:53:35.16 --> 01:53:41.16
How one person could... could do these things?

1521
01:53:41.16 --> 01:53:48.16
I need help.

1522
01:53:48.16 --> 01:53:51.16
Why am I still here?

1523
01:53:51.16 --> 01:53:54.16
How come I don't have extra pains?

1524
01:53:54.16 --> 01:53:59.16
Like anybody else?

1525
01:53:59.16 --> 01:54:02.16
Life is crazy.

1526
01:54:02.16 --> 01:54:04.16
They're real thing.

1527
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:06.16
Yeah, and there is somebody that...

1528
01:54:06.16 --> 01:54:11.16
Somebody, I guess if you look at the world, there's got to be somebody that actually is the luckiest man in the world.

1529
01:54:11.16 --> 01:54:13.16
That's the name of the book.

1530
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:16.16
I think we're finding out it's nonfiction.

1531
01:54:16.16 --> 01:54:21.16
It certainly isn't non-fiction.

1532
01:54:21.16 --> 01:54:25.16
And I'm not a writer.

1533
01:54:25.16 --> 01:54:30.16
I'm just telling you stories of my life.

1534
01:54:30.16 --> 01:54:32.16
The way they come up.

1535
01:54:32.16 --> 01:54:35.16
I don't have big words.

1536
01:54:35.16 --> 01:54:38.16
You don't see anything big in there.

1537
01:54:38.16 --> 01:54:44.16
But it's the way I talk.

1538
01:54:44.16 --> 01:54:47.16
That's generally how to write.

1539
01:54:47.16 --> 01:54:54.16
Not right to impress anybody with my verb age.

1540
01:54:54.16 --> 01:54:57.16
The stories themselves are impressive enough.

1541
01:54:57.16 --> 01:55:01.16
The verbiage is secondary.

1542
01:55:01.16 --> 01:55:05.16
The stories are amazing, you can hear.

1543
01:55:05.16 --> 01:55:12.16
Another thing that you did was take an honor flight.

1544
01:55:12.16 --> 01:55:15.16
The honor flight is a nonprofit organization.

1545
01:55:15.16 --> 01:55:16.16
Great people.

1546
01:55:16.16 --> 01:55:23.16
And they provide their mission as to provide veterans with honor and closure.

1547
01:55:23.16 --> 01:55:28.16
And so they fly veterans to Washington, D.C.

1548
01:55:28.16 --> 01:55:30.16
To see the war memorials.

1549
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:33.16
And your name came up on there.

1550
01:55:33.16 --> 01:55:36.16
And so you ended up going to Washington, D.C.

1551
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:40.16
Thanks to the private donations to the honor flight organization,

1552
01:55:40.16 --> 01:55:43.16
which a great organization, like I said.

1553
01:55:43.16 --> 01:55:46.16
And you said this when you got there.

1554
01:55:46.16 --> 01:55:50.16
I was ticked off because they took so long to complete the World War II memorial,

1555
01:55:50.16 --> 01:55:53.16
only opening in 2004.

1556
01:55:53.16 --> 01:55:55.16
By that time, most of the men from the war were gone.

1557
01:55:55.16 --> 01:55:57.16
I would never have the chance to see it.

1558
01:55:57.16 --> 01:56:00.16
Karlin convinced me that I should go in their memory.

1559
01:56:00.16 --> 01:56:02.16
So that's why I went.

1560
01:56:02.16 --> 01:56:05.16
The irony is that the 135th Infantry,

1561
01:56:05.16 --> 01:56:09.16
which is part of the 34th Division, has a shield that says

1562
01:56:09.16 --> 01:56:11.16
to the last man.

1563
01:56:11.16 --> 01:56:15.16
I was 15 years old the first time I saw that.

1564
01:56:15.16 --> 01:56:20.16
Well, they are all gone except me.

1565
01:56:20.16 --> 01:56:26.16
Who would ever imagine that I would actually be the last man?

1566
01:56:26.16 --> 01:56:32.16
I got that shield right here on my jacket.

1567
01:56:32.16 --> 01:56:41.16
And then came the Battle of the Bulge 75th anniversary.

1568
01:56:41.16 --> 01:56:45.16
And there's a guy named Mitch Mendler,

1569
01:56:45.16 --> 01:56:48.16
fire fighter, paramedic here, right here in San Diego.

1570
01:56:48.16 --> 01:56:49.16
It's a matter of fact.

1571
01:56:49.16 --> 01:56:56.16
And he's the president of a nonprofit organization called World Memorials.

1572
01:56:56.16 --> 01:56:59.16
And doing great work with that.

1573
01:56:59.16 --> 01:57:06.16
And they volunteered to sponsor you to get you out to the 75th anniversary

1574
01:57:06.16 --> 01:57:11.16
of the Battle of the Bulge.

1575
01:57:11.16 --> 01:57:14.16
And you say here, when we went to the airport,

1576
01:57:14.16 --> 01:57:17.16
Food Downal Los Angeles, I was met at the gate by my sponsor group.

1577
01:57:17.16 --> 01:57:22.16
Who introduced me to two of the men entrusted to travel with me.

1578
01:57:22.16 --> 01:57:27.16
Colonel Mike Droll of the Arizona Rangers and Rick Cochran,

1579
01:57:27.16 --> 01:57:31.16
Executive Director, Hispanic Medal of Honor.

1580
01:57:31.16 --> 01:57:37.16
Joshua Kaufman, a Holocaust survivor who survived five concentration camps

1581
01:57:37.16 --> 01:57:39.16
was amongst the group.

1582
01:57:39.16 --> 01:57:43.16
When US troops liberated him at the age of 16,

1583
01:57:43.16 --> 01:57:46.16
he weighed a mere 55 pounds.

1584
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:51.16
His daughter interpreted it for him in Yiddish

1585
01:57:51.16 --> 01:57:54.16
informing him that I was going back for D-Day.

1586
01:57:54.16 --> 01:58:01.16
When she communicated that I was the only one left in my company,

1587
01:58:01.16 --> 01:58:06.16
he, Joshua Kaufman, got down on his hands and knees

1588
01:58:06.16 --> 01:58:09.16
and kissed my feet.

1589
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:11.16
That choked me up.

1590
01:58:11.16 --> 01:58:14.16
He got up and grabbed my hand and said,

1591
01:58:14.16 --> 01:58:18.16
Love you and squeezed my hand.

1592
01:58:18.16 --> 01:58:23.16
We were both crying.

1593
01:58:23.16 --> 01:58:28.16
That's incredible.

1594
01:58:28.16 --> 01:58:31.16
They mentioned closure.

1595
01:58:31.16 --> 01:58:36.16
Actually, meeting an individual that had been in the concentration camps

1596
01:58:36.16 --> 01:58:40.16
and was liberated by American such as yourself.

1597
01:58:40.16 --> 01:58:43.16
That's amazing.

1598
01:58:43.16 --> 01:58:46.16
That only seven years difference in our life.

1599
01:58:46.16 --> 01:58:48.16
I was 22.

1600
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:54.16
What did that happen?

1601
01:58:54.16 --> 01:58:58.16
You know, I've read a bunch of this book so far tonight.

1602
01:58:58.16 --> 01:59:01.16
And I know we've been talking for a while,

1603
01:59:01.16 --> 01:59:05.16
but I wanted to close the book out with this last section

1604
01:59:05.16 --> 01:59:08.16
that I'll read and again, there's so much more in this book.

1605
01:59:08.16 --> 01:59:11.16
I've only covered a couple of the highlights,

1606
01:59:11.16 --> 01:59:14.16
but it was hard to even select which highlights to cover

1607
01:59:14.16 --> 01:59:17.16
because it's all just incredible stories.

1608
01:59:17.16 --> 01:59:20.16
But I wanted to close with this quote here.

1609
01:59:20.16 --> 01:59:21.16
It says,

1610
01:59:21.16 --> 01:59:23.16
It's mind-boggling to have someone kiss your feet

1611
01:59:23.16 --> 01:59:26.16
and thanks for what those soldiers did.

1612
01:59:26.16 --> 01:59:28.16
I am not the one to be kissed.

1613
01:59:28.16 --> 01:59:33.16
I'm representing all the guys who freed all the concentration camp victims.

1614
01:59:33.16 --> 01:59:36.16
It was their actions.

1615
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:38.16
I'm not a hero.

1616
01:59:38.16 --> 01:59:40.16
I'm here too.

1617
01:59:40.16 --> 01:59:43.16
I'm here to tell you what I went through.

1618
01:59:43.16 --> 01:59:46.16
All these people are gone and I'm left alone.

1619
01:59:46.16 --> 01:59:49.16
I can't see where I deserve the credit for that.

1620
01:59:49.16 --> 01:59:53.16
I'm the last one alive to represent these guys

1621
01:59:53.16 --> 01:59:56.16
that gave their lives over there.

1622
01:59:56.16 --> 02:00:02.16
So I could relate this story to everyone.

1623
02:00:02.16 --> 02:00:11.16
And again, the story is incredible.

1624
02:00:11.16 --> 02:00:14.16
You know, you lived it.

1625
02:00:14.16 --> 02:00:16.16
And you're sitting across the table for me.

1626
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:20.16
And you realize how incredible and almost unbelievable it is.

1627
02:00:20.16 --> 02:00:23.16
And you are doing an outstanding job.

1628
02:00:23.16 --> 02:00:28.16
Carrying on and passing on the story of your brothers,

1629
02:00:28.16 --> 02:00:30.16
your comrades and arms.

1630
02:00:30.16 --> 02:00:32.16
They're the heroes.

1631
02:00:32.16 --> 02:00:34.16
They're the heroes.

1632
02:00:34.16 --> 02:00:37.16
And so you're carrying on that story.

1633
02:00:37.16 --> 02:00:39.16
And that's not the end of the story, by the way.

1634
02:00:39.16 --> 02:00:42.16
Because like you said earlier, you're very popular on social media.

1635
02:00:42.16 --> 02:00:44.16
You're a TikTok star.

1636
02:00:44.16 --> 02:00:46.16
You're on Instagram.

1637
02:00:46.16 --> 02:00:48.16
You're on YouTube.

1638
02:00:48.16 --> 02:00:53.16
It's all under the same title, which is Storytime with Papa Jake.

1639
02:00:53.16 --> 02:00:56.16
You have hundreds of thousands of followers.

1640
02:00:56.16 --> 02:01:01.16
And you have millions of views on some of your stories.

1641
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:05.16
Of course this book, but it's just a, it's incredible.

1642
02:01:05.16 --> 02:01:08.16
And the story's not over yet.

1643
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:12.16
Well, I hope it is. I hope it isn't for a while.

1644
02:01:12.16 --> 02:01:16.16
But how did it start with the TikTok thing?

1645
02:01:16.16 --> 02:01:18.16
I did it.

1646
02:01:18.16 --> 02:01:21.16
My granddaughter told you I raised,

1647
02:01:21.16 --> 02:01:24.16
said, say, three years old,

1648
02:01:24.16 --> 02:01:26.16
dances on a cruise ship.

1649
02:01:26.16 --> 02:01:29.16
Crayon of Iris came.

1650
02:01:29.16 --> 02:01:31.16
Crayon cruise ships,

1651
02:01:31.16 --> 02:01:32.16
quit.

1652
02:01:32.16 --> 02:01:34.16
She came home.

1653
02:01:34.16 --> 02:01:44.16
She's a very special person to her grandpa.

1654
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:49.16
And she came over one morning and sat there.

1655
02:01:49.16 --> 02:01:53.16
She says, Papa, I put you on TikTok with me.

1656
02:01:53.16 --> 02:01:56.16
What now, hell is TikTok?

1657
02:01:56.16 --> 02:01:58.16
I, TikTok.

1658
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:02.16
She says, it's a,

1659
02:02:02.16 --> 02:02:05.16
a radio thing.

1660
02:02:05.16 --> 02:02:07.16
She says, and,

1661
02:02:07.16 --> 02:02:11.16
I said, what, what do you put me on TikTok?

1662
02:02:11.16 --> 02:02:17.16
She says, well, why you were talking to me about one of your things happening?

1663
02:02:17.16 --> 02:02:23.16
I recorded it and put it on TikTok.

1664
02:02:23.16 --> 02:02:26.16
And the week she came over, she's, Papa,

1665
02:02:26.16 --> 02:02:30.16
I'm taking, you take in your offer my TikTok,

1666
02:02:30.16 --> 02:02:32.16
and putting you on your own.

1667
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:34.16
What are you doing that for?

1668
02:02:34.16 --> 02:02:37.16
My god, leave it alone.

1669
02:02:37.16 --> 02:02:39.16
I said, you're open air.

1670
02:02:39.16 --> 02:02:41.16
Can't a worms here.

1671
02:02:41.16 --> 02:02:44.16
She says, Papa,

1672
02:02:44.16 --> 02:02:49.16
I took me seven months to get 10,000 viewers.

1673
02:02:49.16 --> 02:02:51.16
Seven months, she says,

1674
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:54.16
you surpassed me in one week.

1675
02:02:54.16 --> 02:02:59.16
I said, well, what does that mean?

1676
02:02:59.16 --> 02:03:05.16
It means that people like to hear you tell stories.

1677
02:03:05.16 --> 02:03:10.16
So that's where I'm out right now.

1678
02:03:10.16 --> 02:03:13.16
Well, it's an amazing story.

1679
02:03:13.16 --> 02:03:15.16
And you're not just on TikTok.

1680
02:03:15.16 --> 02:03:16.16
You're on Instagram.

1681
02:03:16.16 --> 02:03:19.16
There's a YouTube channel that people can,

1682
02:03:19.16 --> 02:03:21.16
if people don't have TikTok, they can watch it on YouTube.

1683
02:03:21.16 --> 02:03:23.16
They can watch it on Instagram.

1684
02:03:23.16 --> 02:03:27.16
I mean, we're going to even Google me and we have to get a response.

1685
02:03:27.16 --> 02:03:29.16
It's crazy.

1686
02:03:29.16 --> 02:03:32.16
The book is called the luckiest man in the world.

1687
02:03:32.16 --> 02:03:34.16
It's a fantastic read.

1688
02:03:34.16 --> 02:03:37.16
It's an unbelievable story.

1689
02:03:37.16 --> 02:03:41.16
And if we weren't sitting here talking to the man himself,

1690
02:03:41.16 --> 02:03:42.16
you'd have a hard time believing it.

1691
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:44.16
But there he is.

1692
02:03:44.16 --> 02:03:49.16
And so definitely pick up the book and it's just incredible.

1693
02:03:49.16 --> 02:03:51.16
Echo.

1694
02:03:51.16 --> 02:03:52.16
Yes, sir.

1695
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:53.16
Do you have any questions at this time?

1696
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:55.16
Do you have any questions at this time?

1697
02:03:55.16 --> 02:03:56.16
Really?

1698
02:03:56.16 --> 02:03:57.16
Yeah.

1699
02:03:57.16 --> 02:04:00.16
Echo usually asks, well, like, some kind of interesting question at the end.

1700
02:04:00.16 --> 02:04:03.16
But maybe today we didn't just, you know, we covered it.

1701
02:04:03.16 --> 02:04:05.16
I'm surprised he, because I'm surprised.

1702
02:04:05.16 --> 02:04:07.16
I thought you're going to ask farming questions.

1703
02:04:07.16 --> 02:04:08.16
Okay.

1704
02:04:08.16 --> 02:04:12.16
But you're going to talk about chickens or horses or something like that.

1705
02:04:12.16 --> 02:04:13.16
Nothing.

1706
02:04:13.16 --> 02:04:14.16
I'm pretty straightforward.

1707
02:04:14.16 --> 02:04:15.16
I think this time.

1708
02:04:15.16 --> 02:04:18.16
Pop a Jake's, pop a Jake Larson.

1709
02:04:18.16 --> 02:04:20.16
We've had you for two hours right now.

1710
02:04:20.16 --> 02:04:22.16
I want to be respectful of your time.

1711
02:04:22.16 --> 02:04:25.16
But if there's any other final thoughts you want to share.

1712
02:04:25.16 --> 02:04:29.16
Amazon is the printer of my book.

1713
02:04:29.16 --> 02:04:34.16
So, and make sure you mention my name.

1714
02:04:34.16 --> 02:04:39.16
There is another book called the Lucky Us Man in the World.

1715
02:04:39.16 --> 02:04:44.16
But we've found out because somebody ordered that book.

1716
02:04:44.16 --> 02:04:47.16
And the long book came to them.

1717
02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:48.16
So.

1718
02:04:48.16 --> 02:04:51.16
Are we going to have to have a contest between you two to see his next.

1719
02:04:51.16 --> 02:04:55.16
I think I don't know if I haven't even read it.

1720
02:04:55.16 --> 02:04:56.16
So.

1721
02:04:56.16 --> 02:05:01.16
But I want to thank you for.

1722
02:05:01.16 --> 02:05:04.16
For the honor of sitting here.

1723
02:05:04.16 --> 02:05:09.16
It is an honor for me.

1724
02:05:09.16 --> 02:05:13.16
Because I think by telling this story.

1725
02:05:13.16 --> 02:05:20.16
You will more honor those who gave their lives.

1726
02:05:20.16 --> 02:05:22.16
For for me to be here.

1727
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:26.16
That I would not be here without those guys.

1728
02:05:26.16 --> 02:05:32.16
That that sacrifice themselves for for me.

1729
02:05:32.16 --> 02:05:34.16
There is a God.

1730
02:05:34.16 --> 02:05:37.16
That's my final word.

1731
02:05:37.16 --> 02:05:38.16
Well, sir.

1732
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:41.16
Thank you so much for joining us today.

1733
02:05:41.16 --> 02:05:44.16
Thanks for your family to get for getting us down here.

1734
02:05:44.16 --> 02:05:46.16
Our friend Jack that connected us.

1735
02:05:46.16 --> 02:05:48.16
Thanks for being here.

1736
02:05:48.16 --> 02:05:50.16
And thanks for sharing your wisdom.

1737
02:05:50.16 --> 02:05:52.16
But most important.

1738
02:05:52.16 --> 02:05:56.16
Thank you for your service to this great nation.

1739
02:05:56.16 --> 02:06:00.16
You and your friends and your generation.

1740
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:03.16
Stood against tyranny and evil.

1741
02:06:03.16 --> 02:06:05.16
And allow us.

1742
02:06:05.16 --> 02:06:08.16
To live under this blessing of freedom today.

1743
02:06:08.16 --> 02:06:11.16
So we thank you and all your brothers in arms.

1744
02:06:11.16 --> 02:06:13.16
Well, thank you, sir.

1745
02:06:13.16 --> 02:06:16.16
For for allowing me to do this.

1746
02:06:16.16 --> 02:06:24.16
And I appreciate very much what you're doing for me.

1747
02:06:24.16 --> 02:06:26.16
Well, we are grateful.

1748
02:06:26.16 --> 02:06:31.16
grateful for you and grateful for your service and sacrifice.

1749
02:06:31.16 --> 02:06:35.16
And the service and sacrifice of all of your comrades in arms.

1750
02:06:35.16 --> 02:06:39.16
And especially, as you have mentioned, the real heroes.

1751
02:06:39.16 --> 02:06:41.16
That did not come home.

1752
02:06:41.16 --> 02:06:43.16
There are the ones.

1753
02:06:43.16 --> 02:06:45.16
God bless them all.

1754
02:06:45.16 --> 02:06:48.16
And we thank you.

1755
02:06:48.16 --> 02:06:54.16
And with that, Papa Jake Larson has left the building.

1756
02:06:54.16 --> 02:07:02.16
And clearly an honor to be able to have him on.

1757
02:07:02.16 --> 02:07:05.16
And hear those stories.

1758
02:07:05.16 --> 02:07:09.16
And you know, talking to him before and after.

1759
02:07:09.16 --> 02:07:16.16
And he's a man. He kept saying he doesn't have any pain.

1760
02:07:16.16 --> 02:07:18.16
And he's doing great.

1761
02:07:18.16 --> 02:07:20.16
He's doing great.

1762
02:07:20.16 --> 02:07:23.16
Because during the podcast, we weren't.

1763
02:07:23.16 --> 02:07:25.16
We're not really yucking it up or cracking jokes.

1764
02:07:25.16 --> 02:07:26.16
But we're downstairs.

1765
02:07:26.16 --> 02:07:28.16
He's we're cracking jokes.

1766
02:07:28.16 --> 02:07:32.16
And even before the podcast started, I said something about me.

1767
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.16
I keep he took a shot at me.

1768
02:07:34.16 --> 02:07:37.16
And I went right back out and talking about being involved.

1769
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:40.16
And I was really sharp.

1770
02:07:40.16 --> 02:07:43.16
Man, just an honor to be able to have him on here.

1771
02:07:43.16 --> 02:07:45.16
And you didn't have any questions.

1772
02:07:45.16 --> 02:07:47.16
That was kind of surprising to me.

1773
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:50.16
No, like my I was wondering.

1774
02:07:50.16 --> 02:07:53.16
And actually now like kind of thinking about it more.

1775
02:07:53.16 --> 02:07:55.16
Let's say clear, clear whatever.

1776
02:07:55.16 --> 02:07:59.16
You always kind of wonder about the experience from.

1777
02:07:59.16 --> 02:08:02.16
What would be in the boat, you know, landing.

1778
02:08:02.16 --> 02:08:04.16
And then going on.

1779
02:08:04.16 --> 02:08:06.16
He did, you know, he talked about it kind of.

1780
02:08:06.16 --> 02:08:09.16
For like better term kind of vaguely where it'd be like, yeah, I'm dodging bullets.

1781
02:08:09.16 --> 02:08:12.16
Yeah, running, running, trying to get away whatever.

1782
02:08:12.16 --> 02:08:13.16
That was sort of it.

1783
02:08:13.16 --> 02:08:14.16
It wasn't like a.

1784
02:08:14.16 --> 02:08:18.16
Like a narrative like a boom landing.

1785
02:08:18.16 --> 02:08:21.16
Like what happened, you know, I'm thinking, save it private saving private.

1786
02:08:21.16 --> 02:08:23.16
Right, and all this stuff, you know, here that, you know,

1787
02:08:23.16 --> 02:08:26.16
because there was a lot of reflections of saving private by the way.

1788
02:08:26.16 --> 02:08:28.16
For sure, it's freaking D day.

1789
02:08:28.16 --> 02:08:31.16
Yeah, you need the shakes like that thing.

1790
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:32.16
There was another one too.

1791
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:35.16
Oh, when he went and when he was looking for a match right for cigarettes.

1792
02:08:35.16 --> 02:08:36.16
And then he goes, oh, hey, you got a match.

1793
02:08:36.16 --> 02:08:38.16
He didn't say you got a match once he even burned Ryan.

1794
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:39.16
But he does.

1795
02:08:39.16 --> 02:08:40.16
But he does.

1796
02:08:40.16 --> 02:08:42.16
He was like, hey, something and he looks boom,

1797
02:08:42.16 --> 02:08:43.16
like I had no face.

1798
02:08:43.16 --> 02:08:44.16
Yeah, boom.

1799
02:08:44.16 --> 02:08:45.16
That's crazy.

1800
02:08:45.16 --> 02:08:46.16
Yeah.

1801
02:08:46.16 --> 02:08:51.16
The book and the book has more details.

1802
02:08:51.16 --> 02:08:55.16
And, and he notes, it's, there's a balance right of,

1803
02:08:55.16 --> 02:09:00.16
want to read some of the book and then get some of his reflections on what he went through.

1804
02:09:00.16 --> 02:09:04.16
So, but just, it's just awesome to have someone like that.

1805
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:12.16
I mean, literally to go from D day to the battle of the bulge is crazy.

1806
02:09:12.16 --> 02:09:14.16
It's crazy.

1807
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:21.16
And, you know, though, he has this jacket, which I'll post on on the interwebs or whatever,

1808
02:09:21.16 --> 02:09:25.16
but it has all the little campaigns that he was in.

1809
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:29.16
You know, D day, say, low, go right down Paris.

1810
02:09:29.16 --> 02:09:31.16
I kind of rattled them off, you know,

1811
02:09:31.16 --> 02:09:34.16
but it's just, it's unbelievable.

1812
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:35.16
It's an honor.

1813
02:09:35.16 --> 02:09:39.16
Obviously, a ton to learn and a ton to reflect on.

1814
02:09:39.16 --> 02:09:42.16
So, thanks.

1815
02:09:42.16 --> 02:09:47.16
Thanks, Jack out there in the, in the, in the world who put this together,

1816
02:09:47.16 --> 02:09:49.16
one of our G.J.J. to browse,

1817
02:09:49.16 --> 02:09:54.16
made the connection told you, told you we could possibly,

1818
02:09:54.16 --> 02:09:58.16
you know, get in touch with him and then you were kind enough to respond to him seven months after

1819
02:09:58.16 --> 02:10:01.16
he initially sent his initial, you know, which was good.

1820
02:10:01.16 --> 02:10:04.16
We like that timing.

1821
02:10:04.16 --> 02:10:06.16
It's tough.

1822
02:10:06.16 --> 02:10:12.16
But, what, when I walk away from this,

1823
02:10:12.16 --> 02:10:17.16
I just think to myself, you know, as as Papa Jake kept saying,

1824
02:10:17.16 --> 02:10:20.16
you know, all these, all these other individuals that didn't make it,

1825
02:10:20.16 --> 02:10:23.16
you know, he's looking at that gravestone thinking,

1826
02:10:23.16 --> 02:10:28.16
this guy didn't get to have the family, the life,

1827
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:31.16
and he did get to have that chance and guess what?

1828
02:10:31.16 --> 02:10:35.16
So, it'll be, so it seems like we should be doing our best

1829
02:10:35.16 --> 02:10:41.16
to live a life that is worthy of those sacrifices.

1830
02:10:41.16 --> 02:10:44.16
Seems like a good plan.

1831
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:47.16
Yeah, it's, it's crazy to think, you know,

1832
02:10:47.16 --> 02:10:52.16
now being the age that we are, to think, like how we mentioned his friend in the,

1833
02:10:52.16 --> 02:10:57.16
in the Air Force, died like 19 years old.

1834
02:10:57.16 --> 02:11:00.16
That's not even half your life, well, that's like your technically,

1835
02:11:00.16 --> 02:11:01.16
you're not even a fool.

1836
02:11:01.16 --> 02:11:05.16
It don't really, and just that's, you know, that's the end.

1837
02:11:05.16 --> 02:11:08.16
I guess you're a full adult if you're in Hope, Minnesota

1838
02:11:08.16 --> 02:11:10.16
because you're up at year six years old,

1839
02:11:10.16 --> 02:11:12.16
milking 32 cows every morning.

1840
02:11:12.16 --> 02:11:13.16
Oh, yeah, night.

1841
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:14.16
Oh, yeah.

1842
02:11:14.16 --> 02:11:16.16
Yeah, that's really, that's cool.

1843
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:19.16
It's cool to read that stuff in the book, for sure.

1844
02:11:19.16 --> 02:11:20.16
What it was like living back then?

1845
02:11:20.16 --> 02:11:21.16
Yeah.

1846
02:11:21.16 --> 02:11:23.16
They didn't have electricity.

1847
02:11:23.16 --> 02:11:24.16
Yeah.

1848
02:11:24.16 --> 02:11:29.16
They didn't have electricity in their house until he got out of the service in 1945.

1849
02:11:29.16 --> 02:11:29.16
Crazy.

1850
02:11:29.16 --> 02:11:30.16
Or we got 45.

1851
02:11:30.16 --> 02:11:34.16
He's all like, oh, that was a big jump from the horse and buggy.

1852
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:35.16
Yep.

1853
02:11:35.16 --> 02:11:36.16
Yep.

1854
02:11:36.16 --> 02:11:42.16
We think we think like, oh, I went from a, you know, a V6 to a V8.

1855
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:44.16
Whoa, that was amazing change.

1856
02:11:44.16 --> 02:11:46.16
Oh, I have so much better off now.

1857
02:11:46.16 --> 02:11:47.16
Got that GPS now.

1858
02:11:47.16 --> 02:11:48.16
Yeah, got that GPS system.

1859
02:11:48.16 --> 02:11:52.16
Yeah, they're in horse and buggy. What about, what about this whole scenario?

1860
02:11:52.16 --> 02:11:55.16
Well, you know, my school was 14 miles away.

1861
02:11:55.16 --> 02:12:01.16
And in the wintertime, the only way to get there is by horse and slave.

1862
02:12:01.16 --> 02:12:02.16
Slave.

1863
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:03.16
Yeah, man.

1864
02:12:03.16 --> 02:12:07.16
By the way, another thing, they're not wearing Gore-Tax.

1865
02:12:07.16 --> 02:12:08.16
Yeah.

1866
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:10.16
Fincellate, freaking, you know,

1867
02:12:10.16 --> 02:12:14.16
Pio, polyester, they're in wool.

1868
02:12:14.16 --> 02:12:15.16
Yeah.

1869
02:12:15.16 --> 02:12:19.16
At best. Some canvas jacket, right?

1870
02:12:19.16 --> 02:12:20.16
Yeah.

1871
02:12:20.16 --> 02:12:21.16
Just a different time.

1872
02:12:21.16 --> 02:12:22.16
Different time.

1873
02:12:22.16 --> 02:12:23.16
Freaking epic.

1874
02:12:23.16 --> 02:12:24.16
That's crazy.

1875
02:12:24.16 --> 02:12:26.16
He, you know, he's color blind.

1876
02:12:26.16 --> 02:12:27.16
Like all this stuff.

1877
02:12:27.16 --> 02:12:28.16
And then he falls down.

1878
02:12:28.16 --> 02:12:29.16
He didn't say, oh, he fell down.

1879
02:12:29.16 --> 02:12:30.16
That was a question I should ask.

1880
02:12:30.16 --> 02:12:31.16
Like, why be fall down?

1881
02:12:31.16 --> 02:12:32.16
Like how do you fall just randomly?

1882
02:12:32.16 --> 02:12:34.16
He tripped over a curb.

1883
02:12:34.16 --> 02:12:35.16
Okay.

1884
02:12:35.16 --> 02:12:36.16
So, you know, a parking curb.

1885
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:37.16
Yes, sir.

1886
02:12:37.16 --> 02:12:38.16
He tripped over one of those.

1887
02:12:38.16 --> 02:12:40.16
He was just like looking off ahead and just did it.

1888
02:12:40.16 --> 02:12:41.16
Boom.

1889
02:12:41.16 --> 02:12:43.16
It's his head color blindness cured.

1890
02:12:43.16 --> 02:12:44.16
And what else is cured?

1891
02:12:44.16 --> 02:12:48.16
No, the, the color blindness was cured when he got cataract surgery.

1892
02:12:48.16 --> 02:12:49.16
Oh.

1893
02:12:49.16 --> 02:12:52.16
There's a section in the book called Medical Miracles or something.

1894
02:12:52.16 --> 02:12:53.16
Oh, good cat.

1895
02:12:53.16 --> 02:12:54.16
And it covers all these things.

1896
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:55.16
He mentioned some of them.

1897
02:12:55.16 --> 02:12:56.16
Oh, yeah.

1898
02:12:56.16 --> 02:12:57.16
His shakes got curled.

1899
02:12:57.16 --> 02:12:57.16
Yeah.

1900
02:12:57.16 --> 02:12:58.16
Your shakes got curled.

1901
02:12:58.16 --> 02:12:59.16
He got hit in the head.

1902
02:12:59.16 --> 02:13:01.16
Okay. So, you're, yeah, you're the correct generation.

1903
02:13:01.16 --> 02:13:04.16
Can you remember Nintendo Entertainment System,

1904
02:13:04.16 --> 02:13:05.16
the original NES?

1905
02:13:05.16 --> 02:13:07.16
I remember it, but I don't,

1906
02:13:07.16 --> 02:13:09.16
I remember that it was a thing,

1907
02:13:09.16 --> 02:13:10.16
but it's not something that I had.

1908
02:13:10.16 --> 02:13:11.16
It wasn't your gym.

1909
02:13:11.16 --> 02:13:12.16
All right.

1910
02:13:12.16 --> 02:13:13.16
You guys, we didn't have electricity in my house.

1911
02:13:13.16 --> 02:13:14.16
Okay.

1912
02:13:14.16 --> 02:13:15.16
No.

1913
02:13:15.16 --> 02:13:16.16
No.

1914
02:13:16.16 --> 02:13:17.16
No.

1915
02:13:17.16 --> 02:13:21.16
We didn't have any money for that kind of thing,

1916
02:13:21.16 --> 02:13:24.16
but I, that might be too strong.

1917
02:13:24.16 --> 02:13:26.16
My dad was like a computer,

1918
02:13:26.16 --> 02:13:29.16
using the computers before computers were really a thing.

1919
02:13:29.16 --> 02:13:33.16
And so he had old school computers.

1920
02:13:33.16 --> 02:13:34.16
Yeah.

1921
02:13:34.16 --> 02:13:37.16
But because you have an old school computer, you're not getting some games.

1922
02:13:37.16 --> 02:13:38.16
So he started.

1923
02:13:38.16 --> 02:13:39.16
Yeah.

1924
02:13:39.16 --> 02:13:42.16
So he was, and plus he thought that a computer was for computing.

1925
02:13:42.16 --> 02:13:43.16
Right?

1926
02:13:43.16 --> 02:13:44.16
Not for playing a game.

1927
02:13:44.16 --> 02:13:45.16
Gotcha.

1928
02:13:45.16 --> 02:13:46.16
So there was no,

1929
02:13:46.16 --> 02:13:48.16
we never had any of those systems.

1930
02:13:48.16 --> 02:13:50.16
Not we never won game playing system,

1931
02:13:50.16 --> 02:13:51.16
but we did have a computer.

1932
02:13:51.16 --> 02:13:53.16
Do you know, do you know about old school computers?

1933
02:13:53.16 --> 02:13:54.16
I do.

1934
02:13:54.16 --> 02:13:56.16
Do you know what a Commodore Vic 20 is?

1935
02:13:56.16 --> 02:13:59.16
Well, you know, that model specifically, you know?

1936
02:13:59.16 --> 02:14:00.16
It's the first model.

1937
02:14:00.16 --> 02:14:01.16
It's the first model.

1938
02:14:01.16 --> 02:14:02.16
It's the first model.

1939
02:14:02.16 --> 02:14:05.16
I want to say that the,

1940
02:14:05.16 --> 02:14:10.16
the, the memory that came with the machine itself was 2K.

1941
02:14:10.16 --> 02:14:17.16
And then there was some carcasses that you plugged in that gave you an extra 4K.

1942
02:14:17.16 --> 02:14:18.16
Yeah.

1943
02:14:18.16 --> 02:14:19.16
This computer was a week.

1944
02:14:19.16 --> 02:14:20.16
Yes.

1945
02:14:20.16 --> 02:14:21.16
Very weak either way.

1946
02:14:21.16 --> 02:14:22.16
Atari.

1947
02:14:22.16 --> 02:14:23.16
What?

1948
02:14:23.16 --> 02:14:25.16
So you didn't even have Atari then?

1949
02:14:25.16 --> 02:14:26.16
No, Atari.

1950
02:14:26.16 --> 02:14:27.16
No, no, it's our brutal.

1951
02:14:27.16 --> 02:14:28.16
It's kind of abuse.

1952
02:14:28.16 --> 02:14:29.16
And eventually we had,

1953
02:14:29.16 --> 02:14:35.16
we had like versions of the games that were on Atari.

1954
02:14:35.16 --> 02:14:37.16
But instead of it being called Pac-Man,

1955
02:14:37.16 --> 02:14:42.16
it was a generic version called like Snack Man.

1956
02:14:42.16 --> 02:14:43.16
You know what I'm saying?

1957
02:14:43.16 --> 02:14:47.16
Because my dad, my dad was a cheap human.

1958
02:14:47.16 --> 02:14:50.16
And he's not, you're not spending money on anything.

1959
02:14:50.16 --> 02:14:55.16
And this was when you get, he was part of like a sharing group where they were

1960
02:14:55.16 --> 02:15:00.16
trade cassette tapes that had this information on it that you could play the game.

1961
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:01.16
Yeah.

1962
02:15:01.16 --> 02:15:02.16
So we're talking to this.

1963
02:15:02.16 --> 02:15:03.16
Okay.

1964
02:15:03.16 --> 02:15:04.16
So okay.

1965
02:15:04.16 --> 02:15:06.16
This might not be horse and buggy, but we're,

1966
02:15:06.16 --> 02:15:07.16
Yeah.

1967
02:15:07.16 --> 02:15:09.16
And you lived on a dirt road too.

1968
02:15:09.16 --> 02:15:10.16
So I'm on I get it.

1969
02:15:10.16 --> 02:15:18.16
Well, either way, the rest of the 99.9% of us that got our Nintendo entertainment system know that.

1970
02:15:18.16 --> 02:15:19.16
There's someone you're in.

1971
02:15:19.16 --> 02:15:21.16
When you Nintendo got kind of older.

1972
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:22.16
Mm-hmm.

1973
02:15:22.16 --> 02:15:23.16
And it would jam up.

1974
02:15:23.16 --> 02:15:24.16
Right.

1975
02:15:24.16 --> 02:15:27.16
You put the game in, you stuff it down, and it, and it, and it, and it blinks.

1976
02:15:27.16 --> 02:15:28.16
Or what?

1977
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:29.16
It doesn't turn on.

1978
02:15:29.16 --> 02:15:31.16
So there's two two methods to get it going.

1979
02:15:31.16 --> 02:15:33.16
Everyone knows the, the one you take the game out.

1980
02:15:33.16 --> 02:15:34.16
You blow it.

1981
02:15:34.16 --> 02:15:36.16
You want it because there might be dust in there.

1982
02:15:36.16 --> 02:15:37.16
I don't know.

1983
02:15:37.16 --> 02:15:38.16
I think it's like, I was going to go either way.

1984
02:15:38.16 --> 02:15:40.16
That'll, you put it back in and usually works.

1985
02:15:40.16 --> 02:15:44.16
Second method is you turn it off and you hit the side of the thing.

1986
02:15:44.16 --> 02:15:45.16
You hit it.

1987
02:15:45.16 --> 02:15:47.16
Just like a, even if you're a TV, you can't hit it.

1988
02:15:47.16 --> 02:15:48.16
Yeah.

1989
02:15:48.16 --> 02:15:49.16
Oh, yeah.

1990
02:15:49.16 --> 02:15:50.16
We'd do it all the time.

1991
02:15:50.16 --> 02:15:51.16
TV's kind of like that too.

1992
02:15:51.16 --> 02:15:54.16
I think that's all Papa Jake's head was.

1993
02:15:54.16 --> 02:15:55.16
You hit his head.

1994
02:15:55.16 --> 02:15:56.16
Oh, shake's gone.

1995
02:15:56.16 --> 02:15:57.16
You can see.

1996
02:15:57.16 --> 02:16:00.16
Maybe they should have blew in his eyes or something.

1997
02:16:00.16 --> 02:16:01.16
Maybe that would have worked.

1998
02:16:01.16 --> 02:16:02.16
That's amazing.

1999
02:16:02.16 --> 02:16:03.16
Nintendo.

2000
02:16:03.16 --> 02:16:04.16
Jake.

2001
02:16:04.16 --> 02:16:05.16
These lessons are everywhere.

2002
02:16:05.16 --> 02:16:06.16
Lessons are everywhere.

2003
02:16:06.16 --> 02:16:08.16
But, you know what is incredible?

2004
02:16:08.16 --> 02:16:11.16
His, his, his, his, his, just incredibly sharp.

2005
02:16:11.16 --> 02:16:13.16
And healthy walking up and down the stairs.

2006
02:16:13.16 --> 02:16:14.16
No factor.

2007
02:16:14.16 --> 02:16:15.16
Yeah.

2008
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:16.16
Just awesome.

2009
02:16:16.16 --> 02:16:19.16
Makes me think about health.

2010
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:20.16
Yeah.

2011
02:16:20.16 --> 02:16:22.16
Mental and physical health.

2012
02:16:22.16 --> 02:16:23.16
Yeah.

2013
02:16:23.16 --> 02:16:26.16
How we can try and maintain that as long as possible.

2014
02:16:26.16 --> 02:16:27.16
Yeah.

2015
02:16:27.16 --> 02:16:28.16
It's true.

2016
02:16:28.16 --> 02:16:29.16
All right.

2017
02:16:29.16 --> 02:16:30.16
Well, we got some solutions to that.

2018
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:31.16
Look at that segue.

2019
02:16:31.16 --> 02:16:32.16
That's a good segue.

2020
02:16:32.16 --> 02:16:33.16
Yeah.

2021
02:16:33.16 --> 02:16:34.16
Oh, I kind of threw you a little softball.

2022
02:16:34.16 --> 02:16:35.16
You're this really.

2023
02:16:35.16 --> 02:16:37.16
Well, hey, we're working out.

2024
02:16:37.16 --> 02:16:38.16
Yeah.

2025
02:16:38.16 --> 02:16:38.16
Right.

2026
02:16:38.16 --> 02:16:39.16
We're shoe pop.

2027
02:16:39.16 --> 02:16:40.16
If I don't make us, let's face it.

2028
02:16:40.16 --> 02:16:44.16
If there's no, if there's not a segue, we're talking about we get, I mean, we were

2029
02:16:44.16 --> 02:16:46.16
just talking about Commodore Vic 20s.

2030
02:16:46.16 --> 02:16:47.16
Yeah.

2031
02:16:47.16 --> 02:16:48.16
Right.

2032
02:16:48.16 --> 02:16:49.16
We will weigh off base.

2033
02:16:49.16 --> 02:16:52.16
Well, so if there's no segue to get us back, you know, who knows what's happening?

2034
02:16:52.16 --> 02:16:53.16
I ain't sure you're correct.

2035
02:16:53.16 --> 02:16:54.16
So segue occurred.

2036
02:16:54.16 --> 02:16:55.16
Yeah.

2037
02:16:55.16 --> 02:16:56.16
Now we're, we're back on track.

2038
02:16:56.16 --> 02:16:57.16
Yeah.

2039
02:16:57.16 --> 02:16:58.16
Back into the workouts.

2040
02:16:58.16 --> 02:16:59.16
Right.

2041
02:16:59.16 --> 02:17:00.16
Papa Jake was 120 pounds.

2042
02:17:00.16 --> 02:17:01.16
See, that's another thing you got to remember.

2043
02:17:01.16 --> 02:17:06.16
It's not like it's like freaking jockel rolling up through, you know, you know, you know,

2044
02:17:06.16 --> 02:17:09.16
you guys talk about like all the gear that you guys carry or whatever.

2045
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:12.16
It's like, about 120 carrying gear, but that's like some effort.

2046
02:17:12.16 --> 02:17:16.16
Well, he said he had 75 pounds of gear plus his weapon.

2047
02:17:16.16 --> 02:17:20.16
So we're talking, that's a massive amount.

2048
02:17:20.16 --> 02:17:22.16
That's the over double body weight.

2049
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:22.16
Yeah.

2050
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:23.16
Now, I did.

2051
02:17:23.16 --> 02:17:28.16
I can tell you that guys nowadays carry way more gear than they did back then for the most,

2052
02:17:28.16 --> 02:17:31.16
especially like a knob.

2053
02:17:31.16 --> 02:17:36.16
And knob, you were just carrying two, well, let me, let me get more specific here.

2054
02:17:36.16 --> 02:17:38.16
The seals and Vietnam.

2055
02:17:38.16 --> 02:17:43.16
One canteen, four grenades, bunch of bags and your weapon.

2056
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:46.16
Like those guys roll the lights light light.

2057
02:17:46.16 --> 02:17:52.16
And nowadays, man, you're going, you got radios, you got so much ammo, you got body armor,

2058
02:17:52.16 --> 02:17:56.16
you got helmet, you got night vision, you got lasers, you got extra batteries for everything.

2059
02:17:56.16 --> 02:18:00.16
It's just a lot more, which is not good, by the way, in many cases.

2060
02:18:00.16 --> 02:18:02.16
So make sense.

2061
02:18:02.16 --> 02:18:06.16
Either way, when you're 120, you better be going extra light.

2062
02:18:06.16 --> 02:18:08.16
Otherwise, that's going to take some effort.

2063
02:18:08.16 --> 02:18:13.16
So nonetheless, that's neither here nor there as far as right now.

2064
02:18:13.16 --> 02:18:15.16
Right now, we're trying to be as strong as we can.

2065
02:18:15.16 --> 02:18:18.16
I don't care, 1 21 80, 1 90, 2 bills, whatever.

2066
02:18:18.16 --> 02:18:21.16
We're trying to be as strong as we can, or yeah.

2067
02:18:21.16 --> 02:18:23.16
And as far as we can, all this stuff, right?

2068
02:18:23.16 --> 02:18:26.16
That's not all of us are going to reach 99.

2069
02:18:26.16 --> 02:18:29.16
By the way, hey, this is just the reality of the situation, but we're going to try.

2070
02:18:29.16 --> 02:18:30.16
Cool.

2071
02:18:30.16 --> 02:18:33.16
So we're going to do good stuff for minds and our body.

2072
02:18:33.16 --> 02:18:34.16
Don't worry, we got you.

2073
02:18:34.16 --> 02:18:36.16
Alright, chocolate supplements.

2074
02:18:36.16 --> 02:18:37.16
Yeah.

2075
02:18:37.16 --> 02:18:38.16
We got you, including energy drinks.

2076
02:18:38.16 --> 02:18:40.16
Sure, we all know about it, but we're going to go over it.

2077
02:18:40.16 --> 02:18:41.16
Okay.

2078
02:18:41.16 --> 02:18:43.16
Energy drinks with sugar.

2079
02:18:43.16 --> 02:18:43.16
Bad.

2080
02:18:43.16 --> 02:18:44.16
I'm simplifying it.

2081
02:18:44.16 --> 02:18:44.16
Bad.

2082
02:18:44.16 --> 02:18:48.16
Energy drinks with preservatives and poisons.

2083
02:18:48.16 --> 02:18:49.16
Bad.

2084
02:18:49.16 --> 02:18:51.16
Energy drinks without preservatives and poisons.

2085
02:18:51.16 --> 02:18:52.16
Good.

2086
02:18:52.16 --> 02:18:53.16
As long as there's no sugar.

2087
02:18:53.16 --> 02:18:54.16
Good.

2088
02:18:54.16 --> 02:18:55.16
Okay, perfect.

2089
02:18:55.16 --> 02:18:57.16
Chocolate discipline, go.

2090
02:18:57.16 --> 02:19:01.16
Energy drink, sweetened with monk fruit, fruit, natural.

2091
02:19:01.16 --> 02:19:03.16
No preservatives, pasteurized.

2092
02:19:03.16 --> 02:19:08.16
An actual healthy energy drink, but Copa, Alpha GPC.

2093
02:19:08.16 --> 02:19:10.16
These are good things for you.

2094
02:19:10.16 --> 02:19:11.16
Yeah, literally good for you.

2095
02:19:11.16 --> 02:19:12.16
Literally good.

2096
02:19:12.16 --> 02:19:13.16
How about what about the downside?

2097
02:19:13.16 --> 02:19:16.16
I have yet to find a downside at all.

2098
02:19:16.16 --> 02:19:17.16
Oh, wait, there's no downside.

2099
02:19:17.16 --> 02:19:19.16
Oh, yeah, when you run out, I can't find the downside.

2100
02:19:19.16 --> 02:19:21.16
We have to be watching out four downsides.

2101
02:19:21.16 --> 02:19:22.16
What can be the downside?

2102
02:19:22.16 --> 02:19:24.16
I can tell you what the downside is, possibly.

2103
02:19:24.16 --> 02:19:29.16
If you drink it too late in the afternoon, you might not go to sleep early.

2104
02:19:29.16 --> 02:19:32.16
Well, you can actually put yourself into a tough situation.

2105
02:19:32.16 --> 02:19:35.16
If you have one at let's say six o'clock at seven o'clock at night.

2106
02:19:35.16 --> 02:19:36.16
Yeah, and here's the thing.

2107
02:19:36.16 --> 02:19:40.16
There's a disclaimer with that too, because that depends on your tolerance for caffeine.

2108
02:19:40.16 --> 02:19:41.16
True.

2109
02:19:41.16 --> 02:19:43.16
So you got to have a kind of be sensitive to it to actually have that problem.

2110
02:19:43.16 --> 02:19:45.16
Cause only 95 milligrams.

2111
02:19:45.16 --> 02:19:46.16
It's like a regular cut.

2112
02:19:46.16 --> 02:19:48.16
It's actually not even that big of a croffle coffee.

2113
02:19:48.16 --> 02:19:50.16
It's like a regular like cup cup.

2114
02:19:50.16 --> 02:19:53.16
Does he even drink one cup of coffee anymore?

2115
02:19:53.16 --> 02:19:54.16
I don't know.

2116
02:19:54.16 --> 02:19:55.16
Yeah, I don't think so.

2117
02:19:55.16 --> 02:19:56.16
I don't know.

2118
02:19:56.16 --> 02:19:57.16
But I don't know either way.

2119
02:19:57.16 --> 02:19:58.16
None the last.

2120
02:19:58.16 --> 02:19:59.16
None the last.

2121
02:19:59.16 --> 02:19:59.16
As I say.

2122
02:19:59.16 --> 02:20:00.16
None the last.

2123
02:20:00.16 --> 02:20:02.16
It does have a little bit caffeine for the little boost.

2124
02:20:02.16 --> 02:20:05.16
But all the other good stuff is a healthy thing.

2125
02:20:05.16 --> 02:20:08.16
I was in Hawaii, Kauai, my homeland.

2126
02:20:08.16 --> 02:20:09.16
Yeah, we were.

2127
02:20:09.16 --> 02:20:10.16
And I was talking to my dad.

2128
02:20:10.16 --> 02:20:11.16
I did 75.

2129
02:20:11.16 --> 02:20:14.16
So I'm telling him about him about my energy drink.

2130
02:20:14.16 --> 02:20:16.16
But like kind of in the beginning, I was like,

2131
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:19.16
I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say,

2132
02:20:19.16 --> 02:20:21.16
I'm not the only one at this table that has an energy drink.

2133
02:20:21.16 --> 02:20:22.16
I'm preaching it.

2134
02:20:22.16 --> 02:20:24.16
I'm just an echo Charles energy drink.

2135
02:20:24.16 --> 02:20:25.16
And I'm preaching it.

2136
02:20:25.16 --> 02:20:28.16
But at first, I'm like, man, why am I even telling you about this?

2137
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:29.16
I'm not going to say 75.

2138
02:20:29.16 --> 02:20:31.16
Not going to drink energy drinks, but then I'm thinking, wait.

2139
02:20:31.16 --> 02:20:35.16
Yeah, you can straight up drink this energy drink and be good.

2140
02:20:35.16 --> 02:20:36.16
Good to go.

2141
02:20:36.16 --> 02:20:37.16
So yeah.

2142
02:20:37.16 --> 02:20:38.16
Be good.

2143
02:20:38.16 --> 02:20:39.16
That's a PC.

2144
02:20:39.16 --> 02:20:41.16
You know, a wise man.

2145
02:20:41.16 --> 02:20:42.16
So you can get that.

2146
02:20:42.16 --> 02:20:45.16
Yes, many different flavors you mentioned, mine is mango.

2147
02:20:45.16 --> 02:20:46.16
The best.

2148
02:20:46.16 --> 02:20:47.16
But I ask around.

2149
02:20:47.16 --> 02:20:48.16
It's the best.

2150
02:20:48.16 --> 02:20:49.16
Interesting.

2151
02:20:49.16 --> 02:20:50.16
Maybe not to concept showing.

2152
02:20:50.16 --> 02:20:53.16
Unless if you don't like the mango, there's all kinds of other flavors too.

2153
02:20:53.16 --> 02:20:55.16
Sour up sniper or enjoy all this stuff.

2154
02:20:55.16 --> 02:20:56.16
Look into it.

2155
02:20:56.16 --> 02:20:57.16
Joccalfuel.com.

2156
02:20:57.16 --> 02:20:58.16
So you can get this stuff.

2157
02:20:58.16 --> 02:20:59.16
Also for your joint.

2158
02:20:59.16 --> 02:21:02.16
Spread a pop a jake talking about his joints.

2159
02:21:02.16 --> 02:21:03.16
Don't even hurt.

2160
02:21:03.16 --> 02:21:04.16
Yeah.

2161
02:21:04.16 --> 02:21:05.16
Okay, that's how I want to be.

2162
02:21:05.16 --> 02:21:06.16
Yeah.

2163
02:21:06.16 --> 02:21:07.16
You're saying.

2164
02:21:07.16 --> 02:21:08.16
And currently, that's how I am.

2165
02:21:08.16 --> 02:21:09.16
My joint's so hurt either.

2166
02:21:09.16 --> 02:21:13.16
So I'm saying it's because of the joint warfare and the superkrill oil.

2167
02:21:13.16 --> 02:21:15.16
You didn't bring any in a way.

2168
02:21:15.16 --> 02:21:16.16
Did you feel it?

2169
02:21:16.16 --> 02:21:18.16
How many days did it take before you felt it?

2170
02:21:18.16 --> 02:21:19.16
Four days.

2171
02:21:19.16 --> 02:21:21.16
You know, it could have been real.

2172
02:21:21.16 --> 02:21:22.16
It was sleeping on didn't help either.

2173
02:21:22.16 --> 02:21:25.16
But it was not a one time felt it in my needle.

2174
02:21:25.16 --> 02:21:26.16
That's not a bed, bro.

2175
02:21:26.16 --> 02:21:27.16
Yeah, no, the bed can make your knee.

2176
02:21:27.16 --> 02:21:29.16
I think I'm plus you got the loose knees.

2177
02:21:29.16 --> 02:21:31.16
The loose skinny knees.

2178
02:21:31.16 --> 02:21:32.16
Whatever.

2179
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:33.16
I was doing squats.

2180
02:21:33.16 --> 02:21:34.16
Do though.

2181
02:21:34.16 --> 02:21:35.16
Squats on vacation.

2182
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:36.16
I'm just saying.

2183
02:21:36.16 --> 02:21:37.16
Yeah.

2184
02:21:37.16 --> 02:21:38.16
You want to stay in the game.

2185
02:21:38.16 --> 02:21:39.16
It was probably a little bit.

2186
02:21:39.16 --> 02:21:40.16
When you travel or just general life.

2187
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:41.16
Yeah.

2188
02:21:41.16 --> 02:21:42.16
Protect yourself.

2189
02:21:42.16 --> 02:21:43.16
D3, you can get that.

2190
02:21:43.16 --> 02:21:44.16
You can get cold war.

2191
02:21:44.16 --> 02:21:46.16
I just had to jack some cold war up.

2192
02:21:46.16 --> 02:21:47.16
Yeah.

2193
02:21:47.16 --> 02:21:48.16
Right now.

2194
02:21:48.16 --> 02:21:50.16
Cause you know you get that little.

2195
02:21:50.16 --> 02:21:54.16
To me when I feel that, I'm like, where's that cold war start hitting in hard.

2196
02:21:54.16 --> 02:21:55.16
Mulk.

2197
02:21:55.16 --> 02:21:59.16
By the way, we just have a discussion.

2198
02:21:59.16 --> 02:22:03.16
Uh, and look, we all know that you have your favorite.

2199
02:22:03.16 --> 02:22:04.16
Yes, sir.

2200
02:22:04.16 --> 02:22:05.16
Which is fine.

2201
02:22:05.16 --> 02:22:07.16
You might maybe your favorite's peanut butter, strawberry, whatever.

2202
02:22:07.16 --> 02:22:08.16
That's cool.

2203
02:22:08.16 --> 02:22:11.16
The fact is after a month.

2204
02:22:11.16 --> 02:22:16.16
It's good to have that alternate opportunity to get into something.

2205
02:22:16.16 --> 02:22:19.16
You know, it's good to have that alternate opportunity to get into something.

2206
02:22:19.16 --> 02:22:20.16
Get into something.

2207
02:22:20.16 --> 02:22:21.16
Getting into something chocolate.

2208
02:22:21.16 --> 02:22:23.16
Getting into some banana cream, which is out now, by the way.

2209
02:22:23.16 --> 02:22:25.16
Have you had the banana cream yet?

2210
02:22:25.16 --> 02:22:31.16
I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to have banana bomber.

2211
02:22:31.16 --> 02:22:34.16
And your assessment is, well, I didn't taste it.

2212
02:22:34.16 --> 02:22:35.16
Oh, okay.

2213
02:22:35.16 --> 02:22:38.16
Just came in like, it came in while I was gone and I opened it.

2214
02:22:38.16 --> 02:22:39.16
I have.

2215
02:22:39.16 --> 02:22:45.16
I have a very strong assessment team to taste things.

2216
02:22:45.16 --> 02:22:46.16
It's my family.

2217
02:22:46.16 --> 02:22:47.16
Sure.

2218
02:22:47.16 --> 02:22:49.16
Because they don't care about anything.

2219
02:22:49.16 --> 02:22:50.16
Yes.

2220
02:22:50.16 --> 02:22:51.16
They will smack me with whatever.

2221
02:22:51.16 --> 02:22:53.16
And banana bomber boom.

2222
02:22:53.16 --> 02:22:54.16
They like that.

2223
02:22:54.16 --> 02:22:56.16
Approved five stars across the board.

2224
02:22:56.16 --> 02:22:58.16
Which is legit.

2225
02:22:58.16 --> 02:23:00.16
Because they will, look at, like I said,

2226
02:23:00.16 --> 02:23:03.16
They have no issue with telling me if something sucks.

2227
02:23:03.16 --> 02:23:04.16
Yeah.

2228
02:23:04.16 --> 02:23:05.16
They'll be all into it.

2229
02:23:05.16 --> 02:23:07.16
And plus, they're also in this stuff.

2230
02:23:07.16 --> 02:23:09.16
Is it a thing?

2231
02:23:09.16 --> 02:23:12.16
Okay, I am, you know what, you know what a food is?

2232
02:23:12.16 --> 02:23:13.16
Yes, right.

2233
02:23:13.16 --> 02:23:14.16
Right.

2234
02:23:14.16 --> 02:23:15.16
It's a thing.

2235
02:23:15.16 --> 02:23:19.16
And I think it's more of a thing now than it ever was like when we were younger.

2236
02:23:19.16 --> 02:23:19.16
Yeah.

2237
02:23:19.16 --> 02:23:20.16
It wasn't a thing.

2238
02:23:20.16 --> 02:23:22.16
No one would ever say I'm really into food.

2239
02:23:22.16 --> 02:23:23.16
They wouldn't even say that.

2240
02:23:23.16 --> 02:23:24.16
Right.

2241
02:23:24.16 --> 02:23:25.16
There was no thing like that.

2242
02:23:25.16 --> 02:23:26.16
It's just like food.

2243
02:23:26.16 --> 02:23:28.16
It's like wine taste or, right?

2244
02:23:28.16 --> 02:23:31.16
Like I'm into wine tasting, but instead of wine is food.

2245
02:23:31.16 --> 02:23:32.16
I think.

2246
02:23:32.16 --> 02:23:36.16
So I think people, kids, younger people these days,

2247
02:23:36.16 --> 02:23:43.16
have more appreciation and sensitivity to taste.

2248
02:23:43.16 --> 02:23:44.16
Yeah.

2249
02:23:44.16 --> 02:23:46.16
So because I'm kind of like,

2250
02:23:46.16 --> 02:23:47.16
Hmm.

2251
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:50.16
If I can stomach it, it tastes good.

2252
02:23:50.16 --> 02:23:51.16
It's good.

2253
02:23:51.16 --> 02:23:52.16
It's good.

2254
02:23:52.16 --> 02:23:54.16
If I can stomach it, it tastes good.

2255
02:23:54.16 --> 02:23:56.16
If I can't, then it's not good, right?

2256
02:23:56.16 --> 02:23:57.16
It's a pretty binary.

2257
02:23:57.16 --> 02:23:59.16
And if I can't, man, they're freaking,

2258
02:23:59.16 --> 02:24:02.16
so when they start getting kind of hyped about something,

2259
02:24:02.16 --> 02:24:03.16
then I know it's good.

2260
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:04.16
So banana bomber.

2261
02:24:04.16 --> 02:24:05.16
Yeah.

2262
02:24:05.16 --> 02:24:06.16
And that is one of those, and I don't know,

2263
02:24:06.16 --> 02:24:08.16
maybe I'm alone on this, but maybe I'm not.

2264
02:24:08.16 --> 02:24:10.16
Banana is a kind of where it's like,

2265
02:24:10.16 --> 02:24:11.16
okay, but it's good.

2266
02:24:11.16 --> 02:24:12.16
It's fine.

2267
02:24:12.16 --> 02:24:13.16
Hmm.

2268
02:24:13.16 --> 02:24:15.16
But let's wait, you know, when you got your more exotic fruits.

2269
02:24:15.16 --> 02:24:16.16
Hmm.

2270
02:24:16.16 --> 02:24:18.16
You know, when I'm ruling it with you,

2271
02:24:18.16 --> 02:24:20.16
you can manage the ad bananas sometimes.

2272
02:24:20.16 --> 02:24:21.16
Oddly, yes.

2273
02:24:21.16 --> 02:24:22.16
And that's not normal.

2274
02:24:22.16 --> 02:24:25.16
We got to send something to Tulsi because Tulsi is kind of the original.

2275
02:24:25.16 --> 02:24:27.16
Banana at her, right?

2276
02:24:27.16 --> 02:24:28.16
Sure.

2277
02:24:28.16 --> 02:24:29.16
She had the specific method.

2278
02:24:29.16 --> 02:24:30.16
Yeah, they're very innovative.

2279
02:24:30.16 --> 02:24:31.16
Yeah.

2280
02:24:31.16 --> 02:24:32.16
For sure.

2281
02:24:32.16 --> 02:24:33.16
She's always on top of things.

2282
02:24:33.16 --> 02:24:34.16
She just out ahead of the curve.

2283
02:24:34.16 --> 02:24:36.16
No, that's not just in the game.

2284
02:24:36.16 --> 02:24:39.16
She's got to open mine and she looks and she assesses and she comes up with a solution.

2285
02:24:39.16 --> 02:24:41.16
Yeah, the frill and banana.

2286
02:24:41.16 --> 02:24:42.16
You're right.

2287
02:24:42.16 --> 02:24:44.16
So frozen rotten, but it was a rotten.

2288
02:24:44.16 --> 02:24:48.16
Uh, we'll say, you know, I extremely, right, but, but the banana.

2289
02:24:48.16 --> 02:24:50.16
Okay. So oddly, banana is like, whatever.

2290
02:24:50.16 --> 02:24:52.16
That's what we should have made this signature flavor for Tulsi.

2291
02:24:52.16 --> 02:24:53.16
Banana.

2292
02:24:53.16 --> 02:24:54.16
Yeah.

2293
02:24:54.16 --> 02:24:55.16
Frozen banana.

2294
02:24:55.16 --> 02:24:56.16
Yeah.

2295
02:24:56.16 --> 02:24:59.16
But um, it's like cucumber, where it's like, cool.

2296
02:24:59.16 --> 02:25:00.16
cucumber's fine.

2297
02:25:00.16 --> 02:25:02.16
But if you get something that's like way better than cucumber,

2298
02:25:02.16 --> 02:25:06.16
then you add cucumber, cucumber makes it go to the middle of the road with it.

2299
02:25:06.16 --> 02:25:07.16
So it kind of brings it down.

2300
02:25:07.16 --> 02:25:08.16
Mm-hmm.

2301
02:25:08.16 --> 02:25:09.16
That's the nature of cucumbers.

2302
02:25:09.16 --> 02:25:11.16
And that's the nature of banana stew.

2303
02:25:11.16 --> 02:25:16.16
For your time until a fancy hotel where they have water and there's cucumbers in the water.

2304
02:25:16.16 --> 02:25:17.16
Yes, sir.

2305
02:25:17.16 --> 02:25:18.16
Do you like that?

2306
02:25:18.16 --> 02:25:21.16
I like the effort for sure, but I like the lemons.

2307
02:25:21.16 --> 02:25:22.16
Yeah.

2308
02:25:22.16 --> 02:25:23.16
Or in the water strawberry.

2309
02:25:23.16 --> 02:25:24.16
We better pineapple.

2310
02:25:24.16 --> 02:25:25.16
Pineapple all that.

2311
02:25:25.16 --> 02:25:27.16
But okay, so cucumbers to me.

2312
02:25:27.16 --> 02:25:28.16
Brim me some plain water.

2313
02:25:28.16 --> 02:25:29.16
Yeah.

2314
02:25:29.16 --> 02:25:31.16
You know, they tried the cucumber gatorade to remember back when

2315
02:25:31.16 --> 02:25:34.16
I was young and younger than I am now, but.

2316
02:25:34.16 --> 02:25:35.16
Sheu comber gatorade.

2317
02:25:35.16 --> 02:25:36.16
No, no, correct.

2318
02:25:36.16 --> 02:25:40.16
You're, you're, you're the freaking idiot on the marketing crew that was like,

2319
02:25:40.16 --> 02:25:42.16
Hey, let's make cucumber gatorade.

2320
02:25:42.16 --> 02:25:45.16
I don't have a chance to be fired.

2321
02:25:45.16 --> 02:25:48.16
But surprisingly, so the point is with the banana,

2322
02:25:48.16 --> 02:25:50.16
surprisingly, and actually not so surprisingly.

2323
02:25:50.16 --> 02:25:56.16
So I like banana, okay, cool fine, but it brings things to banana level if it's better than banana, which is the bad thing.

2324
02:25:56.16 --> 02:25:57.16
But you go banana cream.

2325
02:25:57.16 --> 02:25:59.16
You're going to banana cream pie.

2326
02:25:59.16 --> 02:26:00.16
Yeah.

2327
02:26:00.16 --> 02:26:01.16
Yeah.

2328
02:26:01.16 --> 02:26:02.16
It's freaking legit.

2329
02:26:02.16 --> 02:26:04.16
It's almost like it kind of supersedes.

2330
02:26:04.16 --> 02:26:07.16
It transcends the banana stigma.

2331
02:26:07.16 --> 02:26:08.16
You're the same.

2332
02:26:08.16 --> 02:26:10.16
I'm over here just here to tell you.

2333
02:26:10.16 --> 02:26:11.16
I'm just here to tell you.

2334
02:26:11.16 --> 02:26:14.16
And this banana cream, this is what I expected.

2335
02:26:14.16 --> 02:26:15.16
And taste it.

2336
02:26:15.16 --> 02:26:16.16
Yeah.

2337
02:26:16.16 --> 02:26:17.16
But this is what I expected.

2338
02:26:17.16 --> 02:26:18.16
That's what I expected the banana cream.

2339
02:26:18.16 --> 02:26:19.16
You know what's interesting about this.

2340
02:26:19.16 --> 02:26:21.16
You can tell you been gone for walks.

2341
02:26:21.16 --> 02:26:22.16
You and I are talking to the go.

2342
02:26:22.16 --> 02:26:26.16
It's also funny because you think maybe we had something.

2343
02:26:26.16 --> 02:26:27.16
You know, interesting to talk about.

2344
02:26:27.16 --> 02:26:28.16
Yeah.

2345
02:26:28.16 --> 02:26:29.16
And we're talking about the broadsense.

2346
02:26:29.16 --> 02:26:30.16
No.

2347
02:26:30.16 --> 02:26:31.16
We're literally talking about cucumbers and bananas.

2348
02:26:31.16 --> 02:26:32.16
Yeah.

2349
02:26:32.16 --> 02:26:33.16
We're just jackdots.

2350
02:26:33.16 --> 02:26:34.16
We're hurting people's lives.

2351
02:26:34.16 --> 02:26:37.16
We're taking time away from them.

2352
02:26:37.16 --> 02:26:38.16
So check it out.

2353
02:26:38.16 --> 02:26:39.16

You get the drinks at walla.

2357
02:26:42.16 --> 02:26:44.16
You can get everything at the vitamin shop.

2358
02:26:44.16 --> 02:26:46.16
Go get that stuff up.

2359
02:26:46.16 --> 02:26:47.16

That way we can compete with the large global corporations that are trying to get.

2363
02:26:58.12 --> 02:26:59.12
Yeah.

2364
02:26:59.12 --> 02:27:00.12
We're just talking to take over the world.

2365
02:27:00.12 --> 02:27:01.12
It's true.

2366
02:27:01.12 --> 02:27:02.12
Help us compete.

2367
02:27:02.12 --> 02:27:03.12

2368
02:27:03.12 --> 02:27:04.12
Yeah, man.

2369
02:27:04.12 --> 02:27:05.12
It's true.

2370
02:27:05.12 --> 02:27:06.12
We can help you stay healthy.

2371
02:27:06.12 --> 02:27:10.12
You know, speaking of large global corporations, taking over the world, you know, how they,

2372
02:27:10.12 --> 02:27:15.12
you know, use, you know, what what they do is they do this mass thing where they get the labor

2373
02:27:15.12 --> 02:27:17.12
for it's cheap as they can.

2374
02:27:17.12 --> 02:27:18.12
Yep.

2375
02:27:18.12 --> 02:27:19.12
They get it free if they can.

2376
02:27:19.12 --> 02:27:20.12
They will try.

2377
02:27:20.12 --> 02:27:21.12
Yeah.

2378
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:22.12
If they can.

2379
02:27:22.12 --> 02:27:23.12
See, it doesn't work like that.

2380
02:27:23.12 --> 02:27:24.12
It's not sustainable.

2381
02:27:24.12 --> 02:27:25.12
It's the same.

2382
02:27:25.12 --> 02:27:26.12
Unlike origin.

2383
02:27:26.12 --> 02:27:27.12
See, that is sustainable.

2384
02:27:27.12 --> 02:27:28.12
I'll tell you why.

2385
02:27:28.12 --> 02:27:29.12
It's all made in America.

2386
02:27:29.12 --> 02:27:30.12
Everything.

2387
02:27:30.12 --> 02:27:36.12
All their stuff that denim jeans got geese, jiu-jitsu stuff, the boots wallets.

2388
02:27:36.12 --> 02:27:37.12
What a, is there belt?

2389
02:27:37.12 --> 02:27:38.12
Belt, belt, belt, belt.

2390
02:27:38.12 --> 02:27:39.12
Ballets.

2391
02:27:39.12 --> 02:27:40.12
Wallets.

2392
02:27:40.12 --> 02:27:42.12
Benes, sweatshirts, shorts.

2393
02:27:42.12 --> 02:27:43.12
Oh yeah.

2394
02:27:43.12 --> 02:27:44.12
Pants.

2395
02:27:44.12 --> 02:27:45.12
We got more stuff coming.

2396
02:27:45.12 --> 02:27:46.12
Oh yeah.

2397
02:27:46.12 --> 02:27:47.12
We got the hunt line coming.

2398
02:27:47.12 --> 02:27:50.12
Which the hunt line going to be versatile, too.

2399
02:27:50.12 --> 02:27:51.12
Yeah.

2400
02:27:51.12 --> 02:27:52.12
I was talking to Peter.

2401
02:27:52.12 --> 02:27:56.12
I'm like, hey, you know, like the puffy jackets that everyone wears.

2402
02:27:56.12 --> 02:27:57.12
A lot of people wear.

2403
02:27:57.12 --> 02:27:59.12
Not super puffy, but like a thin puff.

2404
02:27:59.12 --> 02:28:02.12
Yeah, yeah, like when you go snowboarding.

2405
02:28:02.12 --> 02:28:04.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2406
02:28:04.12 --> 02:28:06.12
But that kind of thing.

2407
02:28:06.12 --> 02:28:09.12
When you go anywhere called people wearing that all everywhere.

2408
02:28:09.12 --> 02:28:10.12
Yeah.

2409
02:28:10.12 --> 02:28:11.12
I said, hey, we need that.

2410
02:28:11.12 --> 02:28:12.12
Well, it's a war on that.

2411
02:28:12.12 --> 02:28:15.12
So we're going to be able to have an American made one.

2412
02:28:15.12 --> 02:28:18.12
Because these people are like, oh, well, you know, we support the environment.

2413
02:28:18.12 --> 02:28:24.12
We give some of our, um, some of our, our, our, one percent of our profits to the

2414
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:27.72
environmental causes. Oh, cool. Meanwhile, you're supporting a freaking factory and

2415
02:28:27.72 --> 02:28:33.12
China that's putting more crap into the air than your 1% could ever cover.

2416
02:28:33.12 --> 02:28:36.62
And by the way, the people that are breathing that in is not just the people that live

2417
02:28:36.62 --> 02:28:37.62
there.

2418
02:28:37.62 --> 02:28:41.12
It's also worldwide and the slave labor that they have making these things.

2419
02:28:41.12 --> 02:28:42.12
So we get it.

2420
02:28:42.12 --> 02:28:45.62
You want to say how nice you are.

2421
02:28:45.62 --> 02:28:46.62
We get it.

2422
02:28:46.62 --> 02:28:50.62
You want to talk about your, well, how positive you're doing for the environment.

2423
02:28:50.62 --> 02:28:51.62
Yeah.

2424
02:28:51.62 --> 02:28:52.62
You're not telling the truth.

2425
02:28:52.62 --> 02:28:53.62
Yeah.

2426
02:28:53.62 --> 02:28:57.12
So we're going to, we got, we got your cover or do you say so.

2427
02:28:57.12 --> 02:28:58.12
There's an expression.

2428
02:28:58.12 --> 02:28:59.12
B. T. N.

2429
02:28:59.12 --> 02:29:00.12
All right, B. T.

2430
02:29:00.12 --> 02:29:02.12
Stence for better than nothing.

2431
02:29:02.12 --> 02:29:02.62
Right.

2432
02:29:02.62 --> 02:29:04.12
So people you use that in a good way.

2433
02:29:04.12 --> 02:29:05.12
Like I said, it's better than nothing.

2434
02:29:05.12 --> 02:29:05.62
Right.

2435
02:29:05.62 --> 02:29:06.12
Yeah.

2436
02:29:06.12 --> 02:29:06.12
Yeah.

2437
02:29:06.12 --> 02:29:10.62
He's think workouts, freaking, um, paying attention to your kids.

2438
02:29:10.62 --> 02:29:12.62
Uh, like all this stuff, you can use B. T.

2439
02:29:12.62 --> 02:29:13.62
And the B. T. N.

2440
02:29:13.62 --> 02:29:13.62
Method.

2441
02:29:13.62 --> 02:29:14.62
It's better than nothing.

2442
02:29:14.62 --> 02:29:17.62
It's like looking at the bright side of things, which is, it's not all

2443
02:29:17.62 --> 02:29:18.12
bad.

2444
02:29:18.12 --> 02:29:20.62
You seem saying that's what makes it a tricky thing.

2445
02:29:20.62 --> 02:29:21.62
But let's face it.

2446
02:29:21.62 --> 02:29:24.12
We want to go, what do you, how do you do it?

2447
02:29:24.12 --> 02:29:25.62
The low res, the freaking,

2448
02:29:25.62 --> 02:29:27.62
blue black rule black and white, right?

2449
02:29:27.62 --> 02:29:28.62
B. T. N.

2450
02:29:28.62 --> 02:29:29.62
It's not good.

2451
02:29:29.62 --> 02:29:30.62
Who do the best you can state of?

2452
02:29:30.62 --> 02:29:31.62
Yeah.

2453
02:29:31.62 --> 02:29:32.12
All right.

2454
02:29:32.12 --> 02:29:36.62
So you start giving 1% to something that is a 50% detriment.

2455
02:29:36.62 --> 02:29:37.62
Yeah.

2456
02:29:37.62 --> 02:29:38.62
That's B. T. N.

2457
02:29:38.62 --> 02:29:38.62
That's bad.

2458
02:29:38.62 --> 02:29:39.62
Yeah.

2459
02:29:39.62 --> 02:29:40.62
It seems to be better than nothing true.

2460
02:29:40.62 --> 02:29:41.62
Yeah.

2461
02:29:41.62 --> 02:29:42.62
It's also 49% bad.

2462
02:29:42.62 --> 02:29:43.62
Yeah.

2463
02:29:43.62 --> 02:29:45.62
Freaking savages.

2464
02:29:45.62 --> 02:29:49.62
So origin, you say supply chain, taking care of.

2465
02:29:49.62 --> 02:29:52.62
American, man, taking care of.

2466
02:29:52.62 --> 02:29:55.62
American economy being stimulated.

2467
02:29:55.62 --> 02:29:56.62
Taking care of.

2468
02:29:56.62 --> 02:29:57.62
Taking care of.

2469
02:29:57.62 --> 02:29:58.62
Jobs being created.

2470
02:29:58.62 --> 02:29:59.62
Yes, sir.

2471
02:29:59.62 --> 02:29:59.62
Good job.

2472
02:29:59.62 --> 02:30:00.62
Environment being saved.

2473
02:30:00.62 --> 02:30:01.62
Good job.

2474
02:30:01.62 --> 02:30:04.62
You talk to all of our people there, making stuff, bro.

2475
02:30:04.62 --> 02:30:05.62
They'll tell you all about it.

2476
02:30:05.62 --> 02:30:06.62
Smiling.

2477
02:30:06.62 --> 02:30:06.62
Yeah.

2478
02:30:06.62 --> 02:30:07.62
Oh, man.

2479
02:30:07.62 --> 02:30:08.62
You did tell you.

2480
02:30:08.62 --> 02:30:09.62
What did you say?

2481
02:30:09.62 --> 02:30:10.62
Dot com.

2482
02:30:10.62 --> 02:30:10.62
Dot com.

2483
02:30:10.62 --> 02:30:11.62
That's your biggest concern.

2484
02:30:11.62 --> 02:30:12.62
Also,

2485
02:30:12.62 --> 02:30:14.62
Jocco is a store called JoccoStore.

2486
02:30:14.62 --> 02:30:15.62
JoccoStore.com.

2487
02:30:15.62 --> 02:30:17.62
So we can get you discipline equals freedom.

2488
02:30:17.62 --> 02:30:19.62
Sure, it's hats, hoodies.

2489
02:30:19.62 --> 02:30:20.62
That kind of cool stuff.

2490
02:30:20.62 --> 02:30:22.62
Stuff this is good.

2491
02:30:22.62 --> 02:30:27.62
It's when you want to represent and we're representing on this path.

2492
02:30:27.62 --> 02:30:29.62
You know what decentralized command is?

2493
02:30:29.62 --> 02:30:30.62
Yes, sir.

2494
02:30:30.62 --> 02:30:31.62
Okay.

2495
02:30:31.62 --> 02:30:33.62
So sometimes, is there such a thing as too much decentralized command?

2496
02:30:33.62 --> 02:30:34.62
Yes, sir.

2497
02:30:34.62 --> 02:30:38.62
So, there happens to be where your kid's so we're down with that, right?

2498
02:30:38.62 --> 02:30:41.62
Young Aiden out there decentralized command, making stuff happen.

2499
02:30:41.62 --> 02:30:42.62
Yes.

2500
02:30:42.62 --> 02:30:43.62
Guess what else he made.

2501
02:30:43.62 --> 02:30:44.62
No.

2502
02:30:44.62 --> 02:30:45.62
Can this.

2503
02:30:45.62 --> 02:30:50.62
So, it's funny because in my house, I don't like candles.

2504
02:30:50.62 --> 02:30:51.62
Right?

2505
02:30:51.62 --> 02:30:52.62
Yeah.

2506
02:30:52.62 --> 02:30:53.62
I don't like the smell of them.

2507
02:30:53.62 --> 02:30:55.62
I don't like the more heat being produced in my house.

2508
02:30:55.62 --> 02:30:57.62
I don't like a fire hazard up in here.

2509
02:30:57.62 --> 02:30:58.62
Right?

2510
02:30:58.62 --> 02:31:01.62
I don't like the the the the.

2511
02:31:01.62 --> 02:31:03.62
What's that word?

2512
02:31:03.62 --> 02:31:05.62
The atmosphere that it gives off, right?

2513
02:31:05.62 --> 02:31:06.62
It's so soft.

2514
02:31:06.62 --> 02:31:07.62
Yeah.

2515
02:31:07.62 --> 02:31:08.62
Right?

2516
02:31:08.62 --> 02:31:09.62
You want to make fire.

2517
02:31:09.62 --> 02:31:10.62
We'll make a fire.

2518
02:31:10.62 --> 02:31:11.62
We'll go with that.

2519
02:31:11.62 --> 02:31:12.62
A candle?

2520
02:31:12.62 --> 02:31:13.62
Yes, sir.

2521
02:31:13.62 --> 02:31:14.62
No, we're not happening.

2522
02:31:14.62 --> 02:31:15.62
We got a joccal candle.

2523
02:31:15.62 --> 02:31:16.62
And apparently we have an echo candle.

2524
02:31:16.62 --> 02:31:17.62
Yes, sir.

2525
02:31:17.62 --> 02:31:18.62
So that's out there.

2526
02:31:18.62 --> 02:31:19.62
An echo soap.

2527
02:31:19.62 --> 02:31:20.62
Two.

2528
02:31:20.62 --> 02:31:21.62
By the way.

2529
02:31:21.62 --> 02:31:22.62
So, hey man.

2530
02:31:22.62 --> 02:31:24.62
Do you think sounds good?

2531
02:31:24.62 --> 02:31:25.62
Yeah.

2532
02:31:25.62 --> 02:31:26.62
Yeah.

2533
02:31:26.62 --> 02:31:27.62
Yeah.

2534
02:31:27.62 --> 02:31:28.62
In a good way this time.

2535
02:31:28.62 --> 02:31:30.62
But yeah, there's good stuff on there.

2536
02:31:30.62 --> 02:31:31.62
Joccal store.

2537
02:31:31.62 --> 02:31:33.62
Also on joccal store.

2538
02:31:33.62 --> 02:31:34.62
Sure.

2539
02:31:34.62 --> 02:31:35.62
The shirt locker.

2540
02:31:35.62 --> 02:31:37.62
A lot of updates to that one.

2541
02:31:37.62 --> 02:31:38.62
Upgrades.

2542
02:31:38.62 --> 02:31:43.62
Upgrade sounds like murder, you know, just maybe just, you know, some bad things that are now not bad.

2543
02:31:43.62 --> 02:31:46.62
I like the way you take your ideas and post them on the wall.

2544
02:31:46.62 --> 02:31:49.62
It's kind of funny.

2545
02:31:49.62 --> 02:31:50.62
I give you that.

2546
02:31:50.62 --> 02:31:52.62
I'm trying to help over here.

2547
02:31:52.62 --> 02:31:53.62
You seem saying either way.

2548
02:31:53.62 --> 02:31:55.62
Upgrades on the shirt locker.

2549
02:31:55.62 --> 02:31:56.62
Check those out.

2550
02:31:56.62 --> 02:31:57.62
Short locker.

2551
02:31:57.62 --> 02:31:58.62
If you don't know what that is.

2552
02:31:58.62 --> 02:32:00.62
That's a new shirt every month.

2553
02:32:00.62 --> 02:32:01.62
subscription situation.

2554
02:32:01.62 --> 02:32:02.62
Every month.

2555
02:32:02.62 --> 02:32:03.62
They're all cool.

2556
02:32:03.62 --> 02:32:04.62
They're a little bit more creative.

2557
02:32:04.62 --> 02:32:07.62
You know, you know, inject Daniel does.

2558
02:32:07.62 --> 02:32:08.62
Oh, yeah.

2559
02:32:08.62 --> 02:32:09.62
Well, no.

2560
02:32:09.62 --> 02:32:12.62
He gets the he's he has enough shirts, right?

2561
02:32:12.62 --> 02:32:13.62
Oh, yeah.

2562
02:32:13.62 --> 02:32:14.62
It's pretty common in America.

2563
02:32:14.62 --> 02:32:15.62
You have enough shirts.

2564
02:32:15.62 --> 02:32:16.62
Yes, sir.

2565
02:32:16.62 --> 02:32:17.62
But he still wants to support.

2566
02:32:17.62 --> 02:32:18.62
Yeah.

2567
02:32:18.62 --> 02:32:20.62
And he's seen some shirts and have come out.

2568
02:32:20.62 --> 02:32:22.62
Where he's been like, that one would have been nice.

2569
02:32:22.62 --> 02:32:24.62
So he gift, he gets them.

2570
02:32:24.62 --> 02:32:26.62
And then he gives them to the appropriate person.

2571
02:32:26.62 --> 02:32:27.62
Right.

2572
02:32:27.62 --> 02:32:28.62
Yeah.

2573
02:32:28.62 --> 02:32:29.62
That makes sense.

2574
02:32:29.62 --> 02:32:30.62
Really.

2575
02:32:30.62 --> 02:32:31.62
JD.

2576
02:32:31.62 --> 02:32:32.62
Make an app.

2577
02:32:32.62 --> 02:32:33.62
Subscribe to the podcast.

2578
02:32:33.62 --> 02:32:34.62
Speaking of subscriptions.

2579
02:32:34.62 --> 02:32:35.62
Wherever you subscribe to podcast.

2580
02:32:35.62 --> 02:32:38.62
We're just talking about podcast reviews.

2581
02:32:38.62 --> 02:32:39.62
Yeah.

2582
02:32:39.62 --> 02:32:40.62
It's cool.

2583
02:32:40.62 --> 02:32:41.62
You want to leave a review.

2584
02:32:41.62 --> 02:32:42.62
Yeah.

2585
02:32:42.62 --> 02:32:43.62
I'm just looking at the reviews.

2586
02:32:43.62 --> 02:32:44.62
There are permanent on the Apple reviews are permanent.

2587
02:32:44.62 --> 02:32:46.62
So you go back in time.

2588
02:32:46.62 --> 02:32:49.62
And you go read early reviews about echo Charles Madd.

2589
02:32:49.62 --> 02:32:51.62
The world wasn't roofless place.

2590
02:32:51.62 --> 02:32:53.62
That is totally my fault.

2591
02:32:53.62 --> 02:32:55.62
I, you know, I get what he called.

2592
02:32:55.62 --> 02:32:57.62
I started on the wrong foot.

2593
02:32:57.62 --> 02:32:58.62
What's that expression?

2594
02:32:58.62 --> 02:32:59.94
You know, it got off on the wrong foot.

2595
02:32:59.94 --> 02:33:01.62
This is what my first analogy.

2596
02:33:01.62 --> 02:33:04.62
If I remember correctly was like, you know, he got a balance.

2597
02:33:04.62 --> 02:33:07.62
The dichotomies or whatever you were talking about back then.

2598
02:33:07.62 --> 02:33:13.34
And I made the analogy of a glob of mercury on a trash can lid.

2599
02:33:13.34 --> 02:33:14.34
Oh, that's right.

2600
02:33:14.34 --> 02:33:16.18
And bro, I'm just saying imagine that.

2601
02:33:16.18 --> 02:33:17.18
Try to balance it.

2602
02:33:17.18 --> 02:33:18.18
It's the same thing.

2603
02:33:18.18 --> 02:33:19.18
It's a perfect analogy when you think about it.

2604
02:33:19.18 --> 02:33:23.94
It's just kind of out from fucking left field or whatever.

2605
02:33:23.94 --> 02:33:24.94
And I get it.

2606
02:33:24.94 --> 02:33:25.94
I took heat for it.

2607
02:33:25.94 --> 02:33:28.22
Yeah, you took some heavies in the early days.

2608
02:33:28.22 --> 02:33:29.22
Doing better now.

2609
02:33:29.22 --> 02:33:30.86
K-Dogs on the other day.

2610
02:33:30.86 --> 02:33:36.06
You got his first taste of social media, you know, attacks.

2611
02:33:36.06 --> 02:33:39.06
He even paid out of the lane.

2612
02:33:39.06 --> 02:33:40.70
So anyways, subscribe to this.

2613
02:33:40.70 --> 02:33:41.82
Check out Jockel on Ravlinger.

2614
02:33:41.82 --> 02:33:44.06
We'll call it another one tomorrow.

2615
02:33:44.06 --> 02:33:49.74
So those should be up hitting some pretty interesting topics with my brother, Darrell Cooper,

2616
02:33:49.74 --> 02:33:53.22
grounded podcast, the Warrior Kid podcast.

2617
02:33:53.22 --> 02:33:56.94
And we have Jockel Underground, Jockel Underground.com.

2618
02:33:56.94 --> 02:33:58.78
This is our alternative platform.

2619
02:33:58.78 --> 02:34:06.02
In case we get attacked, banned, shadow banned, which apparently is a thing.

2620
02:34:06.02 --> 02:34:07.02
Now, which has happened.

2621
02:34:07.02 --> 02:34:08.02
Have you been shadow banned?

2622
02:34:08.02 --> 02:34:10.02
I don't think I'm down.

2623
02:34:10.02 --> 02:34:11.02
I don't even fluent.

2624
02:34:11.02 --> 02:34:12.02
Hmm.

2625
02:34:12.02 --> 02:34:13.02
And you never know this piece.

2626
02:34:13.02 --> 02:34:16.02
Maybe I need to take over your pages to post it all my controversial stuff.

2627
02:34:16.02 --> 02:34:19.02
Oh, yeah, so controversial.

2628
02:34:19.02 --> 02:34:20.42
Well, it is interesting.

2629
02:34:20.42 --> 02:34:21.82
You know, it is interesting.

2630
02:34:21.82 --> 02:34:25.34
But you wouldn't think that there'd be anything that they would look at me and go, yeah,

2631
02:34:25.34 --> 02:34:27.02
we need to suppress this guy.

2632
02:34:27.02 --> 02:34:30.74
But hey, here we are, literally being suppressed.

2633
02:34:30.74 --> 02:34:32.58
So we have to have a backup plan.

2634
02:34:32.58 --> 02:34:34.10
We have to have a contingency plan in place.

2635
02:34:34.10 --> 02:34:36.66
So that's where we have Jockel Underground.com.

2636
02:34:36.66 --> 02:34:43.82
If you want to help us build and maintain that across $18.8 in 18 cents a month, that helps

2637
02:34:43.82 --> 02:34:45.22
us build it and maintain it.

2638
02:34:45.22 --> 02:34:47.94
We give you back another additional podcast.

2639
02:34:47.94 --> 02:34:51.02
Do you need more podcasts?

2640
02:34:51.02 --> 02:34:52.42
Probably not.

2641
02:34:52.42 --> 02:34:53.42
Maybe not.

2642
02:34:53.42 --> 02:34:54.42
But maybe you like to chill.

2643
02:34:54.42 --> 02:34:56.62
Maybe you like to hear about some alternative topics.

2644
02:34:56.62 --> 02:34:59.18
And maybe you just want to support either way we appreciate it.

2645
02:34:59.18 --> 02:35:01.86
Also, if you can't support us, we'll support you.

2646
02:35:01.86 --> 02:35:03.82
If you can't afford $8.18 a month.

2647
02:35:03.82 --> 02:35:04.82
That's cool.

2648
02:35:04.82 --> 02:35:07.98
Email assistance at jockel Underground.com.

2649
02:35:07.98 --> 02:35:14.94
We have a YouTube channel, which there's some really good videos on there.

2650
02:35:14.94 --> 02:35:18.94
And most of the really good videos have that extra little component.

2651
02:35:18.94 --> 02:35:22.74
That extra thing that just makes them hit.

2652
02:35:22.74 --> 02:35:23.74
Yes, sir.

2653
02:35:23.74 --> 02:35:25.74
And that thing usually comes from me.

2654
02:35:25.74 --> 02:35:28.34
The assistant director.

2655
02:35:28.34 --> 02:35:29.34
Sure.

2656
02:35:29.34 --> 02:35:30.34
Yeah.

2657
02:35:30.34 --> 02:35:34.82
Well, when Kerry was in the hot seat, Kate, I had to kind of go a little bit deep on

2658
02:35:34.82 --> 02:35:35.82
that one.

2659
02:35:35.82 --> 02:35:40.22
Yeah, you've embraced that role quite nicely.

2660
02:35:40.22 --> 02:35:41.22
It's great.

2661
02:35:41.22 --> 02:35:42.22
We're happy.

2662
02:35:42.22 --> 02:35:43.22
That's just the way it works.

2663
02:35:43.22 --> 02:35:45.66
So subscribe to YouTube channel and check out the videos.

2664
02:35:45.66 --> 02:35:51.30
Also, you can see what Papa Jake looks like.

2665
02:35:51.30 --> 02:35:52.66
And 99 years old.

2666
02:35:52.66 --> 02:35:53.66
99 years old.

2667
02:35:53.66 --> 02:35:54.66
99 years old.

2668
02:35:54.66 --> 02:35:55.66
Precious.

2669
02:35:55.66 --> 02:35:57.06
Also, psychological warfare.

2670
02:35:57.06 --> 02:35:59.66
It's an album we did back in the day.

2671
02:35:59.66 --> 02:36:04.14
Very useful album gets us past our moments of weakness.

2672
02:36:04.14 --> 02:36:06.14
You ever think about, and I'm not saying new jockel.

2673
02:36:06.14 --> 02:36:10.86
I'm saying to our people, you ever think about the day where you're about to slip or

2674
02:36:10.86 --> 02:36:12.10
you're about to skip the workout.

2675
02:36:12.10 --> 02:36:13.78
What if jockels like right there?

2676
02:36:13.78 --> 02:36:15.82
Not yelling, not yelling, by the way.

2677
02:36:15.82 --> 02:36:18.78
Just telling you, hey, like hey, let's not skip this workout.

2678
02:36:18.78 --> 02:36:21.34
In fact, here's some good reasons why you shouldn't skip this workout.

2679
02:36:21.34 --> 02:36:26.98
So I'm saying, and it was just telling you, practical advice to not skip the workout.

2680
02:36:26.98 --> 02:36:27.98
You probably do the workout.

2681
02:36:27.98 --> 02:36:28.98
You probably do the workout.

2682
02:36:28.98 --> 02:36:29.98
So it's psychological warfare.

2683
02:36:29.98 --> 02:36:30.98
It's straight up.

2684
02:36:30.98 --> 02:36:35.98
So you get that, and you get that wherever you can get MP3s.

2685
02:36:35.98 --> 02:36:36.98
It's a good one.

2686
02:36:36.98 --> 02:36:41.54
Also, if you want to hang something awesome on your wall, go to flipsidecampus.com, which

2687
02:36:41.54 --> 02:36:45.78
is Dakota Myers company, and he makes awesome stuff to hang on your wall.

2688
02:36:45.78 --> 02:36:47.18
That's what it is made in America.

2689
02:36:47.18 --> 02:36:48.18
Got some books.

2690
02:36:48.18 --> 02:36:50.98
Obviously, first book, Lucky's Man in the World.

2691
02:36:50.98 --> 02:36:54.30
Stories from the Life of Papa Jake, by Jake Larsen.

2692
02:36:54.30 --> 02:36:55.74
It's a great book.

2693
02:36:55.74 --> 02:37:02.22
We skimmed the surface today, go check it out, support the man himself.

2694
02:37:02.22 --> 02:37:03.66
Also, final spin.

2695
02:37:03.66 --> 02:37:10.14
Had that story come out, had that book come out, and check that one out.

2696
02:37:10.14 --> 02:37:15.30
If you want to check that one out, I would recommend you don't read it on a plane like

2697
02:37:15.30 --> 02:37:17.78
JPDNL if you're going to get embarrassed when you're crying.

2698
02:37:17.78 --> 02:37:22.74
I'm not saying you're going to cry, but I'm saying it's an emotional book.

2699
02:37:22.74 --> 02:37:24.02
It's an emotional roller coaster.

2700
02:37:24.02 --> 02:37:25.02
So check that out.

2701
02:37:25.02 --> 02:37:27.54
There's some lessons in there.

2702
02:37:27.54 --> 02:37:28.90
Leadership, strategy, and tactics field manual.

2703
02:37:28.90 --> 02:37:32.58
The code, the evaluation of protocol, discipline, equals freedom field manual.

2704
02:37:32.58 --> 02:37:34.78
Way of the warrior kid, one, two, three.

2705
02:37:34.78 --> 02:37:36.14
Christmas is coming.

2706
02:37:36.14 --> 02:37:39.06
I don't care what you could be a billionaire.

2707
02:37:39.06 --> 02:37:41.94
You can't get a kid, a better gift than those four books.

2708
02:37:41.94 --> 02:37:42.94
That is a fact.

2709
02:37:42.94 --> 02:37:48.34
There's nothing you can get a kid that you know better than those books.

2710
02:37:48.34 --> 02:37:49.34
Nothing.

2711
02:37:49.34 --> 02:37:50.34
Nothing.

2712
02:37:50.34 --> 02:37:51.34
There's nothing better.

2713
02:37:51.34 --> 02:37:52.34
That's a bold statement.

2714
02:37:52.34 --> 02:37:54.34
And I stand by it 100%.

2715
02:37:54.34 --> 02:37:58.82
There's nothing that could have better influence on a kid than those four books.

2716
02:37:58.82 --> 02:38:02.58
When, okay, do you remember the date that part one way or the way you keep coming?

2717
02:38:02.58 --> 02:38:03.58
I want to say 2016.

2718
02:38:03.58 --> 02:38:04.58
Okay, 16.

2719
02:38:04.58 --> 02:38:07.18
So we got what five years in the bank.

2720
02:38:07.18 --> 02:38:10.66
Maybe a little bit more than five years.

2721
02:38:10.66 --> 02:38:12.86
My daughter was eight now.

2722
02:38:12.86 --> 02:38:14.82
Still demands.

2723
02:38:14.82 --> 02:38:16.86
I read every single night.

2724
02:38:16.86 --> 02:38:18.26
Part one.

2725
02:38:18.26 --> 02:38:19.26
We just finished it.

2726
02:38:19.26 --> 02:38:20.26
Again.

2727
02:38:20.26 --> 02:38:23.78
Just the best gift you can give for a kid.

2728
02:38:23.78 --> 02:38:24.78
So hook that up.

2729
02:38:24.78 --> 02:38:28.84
Also Mikey in the Dragons for the Little Little Kids, best little kids book that's ever

2730
02:38:28.84 --> 02:38:29.84
been written.

2731
02:38:29.84 --> 02:38:33.34
That's what I've been hearing a lot.

2732
02:38:33.34 --> 02:38:39.76
You know when dads post and say they have a hard time making it through the book without

2733
02:38:39.76 --> 02:38:40.76
tearing up.

2734
02:38:40.76 --> 02:38:42.76
That's what we're at.

2735
02:38:42.76 --> 02:38:44.82
Yeah, if you let it for sure.

2736
02:38:44.82 --> 02:38:46.54
That's kind of where we're at.

2737
02:38:46.54 --> 02:38:51.14
Without face back worth and then extreme ownership and the economy of leadership.

2738
02:38:51.14 --> 02:38:54.78
Also we have Eshlam front, which is a leadership consultancy.

2739
02:38:54.78 --> 02:38:56.90
We solve problems through leadership.

2740
02:38:56.90 --> 02:38:58.02
Leadership is the solution.

2741
02:38:58.02 --> 02:39:01.54

2747

You can't get good at GJ2 in one day.

2748
02:39:23.30 --> 02:39:24.74
You can't get good at basketball in one day.

2749
02:39:24.74 --> 02:39:26.46
You can't get a good guitar in one day.

2750
02:39:26.46 --> 02:39:28.82
You can't get good at leadership in one day.

2751
02:39:28.82 --> 02:39:33.38
You also can't get a good at leadership from reading one book one time and thinking you got

2752
02:39:33.38 --> 02:39:34.38
it.

2753
02:39:34.38 --> 02:39:35.38
It doesn't work like that.

2754
02:39:35.38 --> 02:39:36.94
That's why we made the extreme ownership academy.

2755
02:39:36.94 --> 02:39:38.42
If you want to come, you want to ask questions.

On Instagram, on TikTok, on YouTube.

2770
02:40:37.78 --> 02:40:40.78
Great, great stuff to watch.

2771
02:40:40.78 --> 02:40:45.22
And to all the service men and women, past president future.

2772
02:40:45.22 --> 02:40:46.22
Thank you.

2773
02:40:46.22 --> 02:40:52.78
And especially to those of you that served in World War II, whether you're here with us

2774
02:40:52.78 --> 02:40:59.62
in this life or you moved on to the next, we will not forget what you did for us and

2775
02:40:59.62 --> 02:41:09.02
for mankind and to our police, law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, E&T's, dispatchers,

2776
02:41:09.02 --> 02:41:13.90
correction officers, board of patrol, secret service and all the first responders out there.

2777
02:41:13.90 --> 02:41:21.62
Thank you for your service, which keeps us safe here on the home front.

2778
02:41:21.62 --> 02:41:26.38
And everyone else out there.

2779
02:41:26.38 --> 02:41:29.90
This life is a gift.

2780
02:41:29.90 --> 02:41:31.94
It's a gift and I'll tell you something else.

2781
02:41:31.94 --> 02:41:34.66
It is a fleeting gift.

2782
02:41:34.66 --> 02:41:42.50
And every day that we have is a one day closer to death and as Papa Jake said, you can't

2783
02:41:42.50 --> 02:41:45.66
turn back time.

2784
02:41:45.66 --> 02:41:53.18
You cannot turn back time in the end, even forever is too short.

2785
02:41:53.18 --> 02:42:00.82
So follow the example of this brave man that we heard from today, Jake Larson, and live

2786
02:42:00.82 --> 02:42:10.94
every day to the utmost and you do that by going out there and getting after it.

2787
02:42:10.94 --> 02:42:27.06
Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
