but it also gave me a decent amount of time at this point it was another year before we started the medical retirement process which actually took two years so it carried me to 21 years and it gave me a lot of time to really look at you know where does my future go from here and kind of lay out what are my new passions what is my purpose and where do I go from this life after the military what can I do with all these lessons that I've learned and you know how do I pay it forward how do I honor Ryan how do I honor all these guys that every day I walk by this granite wall and they didn't get a choice they didn't get a choice to come home so thankfully you know I had that time it's still within the community but also coming to grips with the fact that you know like I talked to those young men about so many people are so strongly tied to what they do for a living that they cannot function if suddenly it's taken away from them there's a lot of a lot of me to a lot of police officers and firefighters or professional athletes that if suddenly their career is over they don't know how to function without that they've they've tied their identity so much around what they've done and I realized that the lessons that I learned in the the the seal teams and this journey that I been on was incredibly relatable and it was had nothing to do with tactical lessons you know I didn't need to be the guy that got out and taught you how to shoot or do anything and that like that what I realized is there were amazing life lessons the lessons human lessons lessons in leadership and teamwork and overcoming adversity in this idea of helping people you know not only survive but thrive from crisis and ambushes so that really started to become the path that I was walking and to help other wounded warriors well I just want to wrap this last little section of the book because we're talking about the identity and what you invested your life into and you say this I held the trident in my hand this golden emblem had driven my life I focused on it I coveted it but you know the process of the mission is the same I mean I know probably you up talked other people you know the guys that did the bin Laden raid the mechanics of that mission were the same it was just a level you know how we take down a target is pretty much the same regardless of where you go and it was the same for this case there were just some things that made us go maybe we should prepare a little more you guys roll on the target and the thing is get pretty intense pretty quick once you've once you've hit the target you've got it secured now we got some squirgers meaning some folks that we think have run away from the target building again I'm not going to go into the full detail of the mission which you did a beautiful job of explaining what this was like in the book and that's why people get the books they can read it but as we mentioned earlier this ends up in a firefight in your in it going back to the book I keyed my radio and called J.P. troops and contact troops and contact I have three wounded including me the machine guns were still blazing away at us and they walked their barrels right and left Chris crossing our positions with hundreds of 7.62 millimeter bullets I recognize that if I didn't get a turner kit on what I thought was the stump of my left arm I was going to bleed out I looked back at Al and the rest of my team behind the tire yeah you know and this is an interesting fact you know I talked to a lot of other team guys about this I think a lot of us we do a really good job in the seal teams and you know I'd like to assume other military units do the same we do a really good job of preparing guys if they get killed you know page two we make sure they're all taken care of I don't think any of us ever give much thought I should if I was severely wounded I think most of us think one side of the coin is you know it'll be merely a flesh wound you know and I was like no way am I going to allow that to happen it is a choice and that's what people need to understand you know having a positive attitude on how you handle the situations you're in is a choice and the more you accept positivity and drive it forward the more you actually start to believe it and it will create momentum and that's really what happened with that sign I said I will not allow that to happen again no one will come in here and be sad because I refuse I will not allow it and you never know the impact of the decision that you're going to make you you never know how even though deep down inside you were like you know holy shit how do I get out of this situation but you project that positivity who you can bring with you and bring up and how much you can leave an impact of the last of lifetime that sign has gone on to help hundreds of thousands of people I've had people write me that have had cancer I've had people that have written me that have had major horrific accidents I didn't keep the sign I had it framed and it hangs in the wounded ward at Walter Reed and the bottom of the sign is like rub clean now and I'm told that all these wounded warriors whenever they go to a surgery they go by and they rub it but you know you're trying to make calls you're trying to let people know what's going on you're trying to decipher the situation because it was a rough situation that you guys were in and you end up you know get next-directed your boys took care of you they did I owe my life to those guys I mean they fought back that gunship overhead you know for special operations squadron I owe my life to those guys that was the closest fire mission ever in the Iraq war we were well well they wouldn't bring in that mission because we were we were literally within any danger growth close programmer there were the machine guns that had me pinned down we're about 45 feet 50 feet away so Al did an amazing job I mean this was his third combat deployment you know experience jac experience team leader and you know really you too there's a good on the video version of this podcast too by the way so you know you can see what everybody looks like if you hear about that sort of thing people watch people watch ones with guests because they want to see what they know what I look like they know what echo looks like they want to see what Jay Redmond looks like they want to see what a what does a man look like that took a round three of the face right there come on at that point they stop the podcast and press play on YouTube that's what you're saying so what it is got a brand problem going on good opportunity look forward actually I like that like a for you know because there's a lot of different approaches you know like you say get off the X and like look forward absolutely you have to show any people look back they look back what they've lost yeah back what's going on right now kind of thing which is natural by the way and I tell people that you know you have to push yourself into those zones and discomfort so that you can handle these hard situations when they come because if you've never forge yourself if you've never been put into these areas it discomfort you're going to be crushed when they come because you're not going to be ready I was so ready for that moment when it came I mean you know took me about 36 hours after I got home to figure it out but still that's pretty quick for a devastating injury like that and I never looked back you're your in Bethesda and just just to kind of give a little bit of detail around that you got some doctor named female doctor named Dr. Malard and here we go back to the book kind of she's about to list your kind of your situation that you're in with energetic bluntness she laid out the extent to my wounds the machine gun bullet entered just in front of my right ear it shattered my job vaporized my right or burrow floor destroyed my cheek and exit through my nose I'd suffered nerve damage as well virtually nothing was left to my cheek bone or ocular floor bones on the right side of my face she and her team was amazed I didn't suffer greater I damage but you know it's a great school everyone I know that the range is that I know are awesome guys so great school but oftentimes we use it in the seal teams maybe punishment is the wrong word in some cases I know it's been punishment occasionally a guy I want to go there but generally guys I mean generally guys are working so I'm not going to go to range your school you end up getting the range of school and here we go sick hungry burning with resentment because as you said you're not at this point you're still like yeah just kind of learning from him well one of the this this was another bit of a of a surprise to me again this is the kind of thing that I never had to think about but here you go go back to book in the months that followed I knew that I was in for the long game the slog through surgeries and setbacks continue and again you got to read this book to realize the absolute just medical uh medical trauma that you're going through day in day out and this really drove it home to me I called it medical bud there you go it's really what it was medical buds and here's here's one thing that just hit me like a ton of bricks by the summer of 2009 I was starting to run low on the available patches of skin for grafting my body was rope with scars from surgical sites and over a dozen graphs that to me I'm thinking myself I mean you're running out of skin to graft to do to do damage repair to your face what is that process like so a lot of times they harvest the skin from you know your thighs and areas and and it wasn't that I was just running out of skin they were running on the skin because I've got quite a few tattoos so my back is totally tattooed you know I called the Fred and asked if the western Overwatch team was still in place gunfire erupted over the radio as he heat his mic and answered I think so okay good that gave us eyes above and control over the high ground over there this is the moment Jay go prove yourself as we dropped off the lip senior chief carry called to me over the radio and wanted to know what I was doing we're going down I told him he went ballistic absolutely not we need to link back up fall back the boys needed help and we were closest if it had been anybody else I might have thought twice about his call but my own personal quest to prove myself coupled with my intense hatred for him clouded my judgment I ignored him and we pressed on as we dropped further into the valley we lost all communication with the headquarters team I began to realize what a hairy situation I had just placed the two of us in we had given up the high ground to move down a thousand feet of vertical terrain to try and link up with an element under fire with an enemy force almost one kilometer away I pushed this thought to the back of my mind the boys need help focus on that but where was the fight the sounds of battle echoed all across the valley making it difficult to calculate distance and direction a broken transmission filled my earpiece I couldn't tell what it was but I recognized Jaydee's voice I tried to establish contact a moment later through washers of static Jaydee's voice came back where the hell are you Jaydee demanded I told him we were at the tea intersection on the valley floor get your ass out of the valley now he said with so much anger I could almost feel a blast of fire shoot out of the earpiece I was about to explain my intent when he added those guys are in a major fight and we can't call in close air support because we don't know where you are that shook me there were aircraft over head waiting to join the battle with rockets and bombs yet they could not make their runs because of my decision to go into the valley I should have thought about art air assets it was exciting because it suddenly rangerschool suddenly became a new opportunity and really I set my sights on you know kind of interestingly enough I think all of us are super gold ribbon people and for the first time I saw an opportunity and and set a goal you know which is what I think all of us do so well at you know we we have a target to move to and now I have a path to go after it and that that path became I want to graduate the honor man of this course and set it set you know woke up the next morning firing up the guys around me and hey man we're getting ready to start up again it's going to be awesome let's go do this the the trust when broken is extremely hard to rebuild and I get asked a lot how do you build trust with people either whether it's been broken or whether you don't know them and it's very clear in the book and again this is why people should get the book the way that you're asking to commander and I'm trying to think of the alias because I know them to jp the way that you're asking to commander is very common to what a guy does he gives you a little bit of responsibility and let you let you earn a little bit of trust and then once you've earned a little bit of trust gives you a little bit more responsibility once you earned a little bit more trust and that continued going this is this is now a six month appointment plus a year long work up or whatever so keys been giving you a little bit of trust and you've been earning and earning and earning back your trust and you are digging out of a deficit right and you know when I when I kick off the book that I wrote with a extreme ownership you know kicks off with a blue on blue and you know it was it was a lot of bad things happening there was a lot of moving parts going on it was a horrible situation and a rocky soldier got killed several more got wounded one of my guys got wounded and I can tell you right now like I think if I would have said hey this wasn't my fault blame it on someone else yeah burning with resentment I went into the first few days without my heart or mind engaged the first week of Ranger School is nothing but a gut check long days with minimal sleep exposure the elements in constant physical and mental evolutions to get those who don't want to be there to quit teamwork leadership within a circle of peers and decision making under stressful conditions where the objective of this first phase as a seal I should have represented my community in the best possible manner while by displaying leadership a commitment to teamwork and a willingness to overcome obstacles instead my actions showed me to be arrogant ill tempered and unwilling to work with others many soldiers falsely believe that seals are like that and my actions re-simply reinforced it I failed to represent my community as anything but that stereotype so you have this bad attitude you go out on a compass course you're pretty good at land nav you think you're gonna kick ass you don't kick ass you do a bad job the black hat to the Ranger instructors here we go the black hat's chuckled with laughter damn squid got lost we should have given you a boat swabby another growl not surprising seals know how to navigate anyways I failed at something I once took great pride in not so good without your Gucci gear are you another sneered I lost it all my pent up fury frothed out of me screw this course and screw you kiss my ass I walked up to my company instructor and told them I'm out of here I quit are you sure you want to do that without thinking I said yes I was reading this book and I was like day I was thinking damn and it it just manifested itself in that moment where I failed the land nav course because of my own arrogance and then you know I allowed those Ranger instructors to get under my skin in that failure instead of immediately saying well hey no big deal I could have gone back and done it again like three days later because there I wasn't the only guy that failed there were other guys that failed but instead of that I instantly just it was one additional blow that I had sustained and being at this tipping point you know I allowed them to get under my skin and snapped and it is the only thing I have ever quit in my life that I have verbally quit I mean for all intense and purposes I rang the bell in that moment and so angry and frustrated and listened to that demon that said your career is over you will never recover from this you know this is the final straw you know you had an opportunity and you missed it man I they're like I don't even know how your arms work and the way it is so when I met the guy from Duke who was one of the premier you know hand and arm guys literally the guy that put my arm together was probably the premier hand and arm going I tried to get him to go back and do more and he said no he said there's no way in hell he said your arm he said going into your arm and getting what we got is a miracle he's like I am not going back in and it was at that point that I really started to analyze myself and this something I talked to a lot of people about you know you truly have to know yourself you cannot because our weaknesses manifested themselves in the hardest times they don't come out in the good times and the good times there's no issues with it and the only way you could manage that you know it's to a mental leadership and emotional leadership at the highest level because in the hardest times and usually those in the times you've got to be managing the most is when it comes up and it was by really starting to rip myself apart and look at you know all these things that I had done and understanding and I think you continue to do that obviously every day with what you're doing and how you're doing it and how you're taking the lessons that you learned and bringing them to more people spreading the word broadly what did that transition look like like the you know from the time you got out into where you are now because you know I mean obviously everyone that's in the military right now one day I hate to break the news to y'all one day you're gonna be not in the military anymore bring us from you know the end of your career into where you are now and where your focus right now and what you're doing and so you escalate the deep confliction to a visible laser and then you know they realize that that both sides were friendly and you was a marine core colonel that you were lacing and he wasn't too happy about that and when you when when your commander brought you in and said hey what that'll happen you took ownership of it and said hey here's the mistakes I made instead of blaming everyone else so big big turning point and and I think this is an important point you know you you know I mean within our community it's pretty hard to turn around when you've made a major mistake like that I mean all of you guys get out we've had guys that have been sent to the fleet and some never come back and you know the funny thing is you know I tried to paint it in that moment arguing with J.D that I was doing the right thing I'm taking the fight to the enemy I'm you know supporting my brothers and all this BS you know the reality was I wanted to get in the fight at that point I had been on the edge of a lot of fire fights and you know and even fighting I'm in until you get in there you haven't proved yourself
