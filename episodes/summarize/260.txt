yeah kind of and then you know what kind of in the total eight minute nap thing sometimes six minutes it's almost like in this is all what do you call hypothesis and what will say that where if like if you could just go like if you just did like a marathon freaking podcasters or you know after you do a podcast you mentioned where you're kind of tired you know something that that that required like cognitive effort for a somewhat sustained amount of time you you're not exhausted physically but mentally you might have like this sharpness they usually have this just dull because like your your foot like it's almost like a superficial conscious like cognitive like a bit almost that's what it almost seems like so if I'm working on something on the computer like admin numbers or freaking stuff not editing stuff like you know work for like three hours so I would say use a little caution if you're going to read them before you go to bed I would more read them in the morning I would more you know read them during the day have the books sit now have it you know like in a place where you're thinking about it and you can pick it up sometimes here's here's what here's what I called compromise when working with other people and dynamic situations and relationships and deals a person especially a leader must compromise finding the common ground between teams merging different approaches to the same problem bridging personalities with people who might not get along reaching agreements and courses of action all these require compromise and in many cases a failure to compromise is a failure to succeed so so it's important because you know a lot of times people might well the not even might a lot of times people have the impression me there's no compromise when the reality is like oh what do you want to do that sounds like a good idea let's move in that direction as a leader it's you actually have to do that a good leader does that a good leader compromise is to a lot of things right of course you're going to have principles and values that you can't compromise but those should be small we're not small they're huge but they should be a small number of things so going back to the book but those are external compromises with other people other humans that have their own personalities and ethos and issues and compromise is needed in order to unify so to work with them compromise is a must but internally it's different with myself I have to hold the line there are areas within myself where I cannot compromise I am going to work hard I am going to train hard I am going to improve myself I am going I am not going to rest on my laurels I'm going to own my mistakes and confront them I am going to face my demons I am not going to give up or give out or give in I am going to stand I am going to maintain myself discipline and on those points there will be no compromise not now not ever reading that right before I go to sleep probably not going to do it because then I probably do a burpees in the corner of the room so so this one this is not the kind of things that you want to read like right before you go to bed maybe because for me what happens it's the weirdest thing it's I've never done a psychedelic drug before but it kind of feels like a psychedelic drug where my mind is going down paths like I'm thinking about something and I can feel it like you know when I like a special of like an old school special effect when you go through some like space tunnel like a place time tunnel or something or something like a normal thing so I'll be doing that and then all of a sudden it'll go like a roller coaster off to a side and go down all I'll go down some other what you call it what I go down some other wormhole of thought no I shouldn't say like that give the gift of discipline there we go give the gift of discipline see you could cut a made a cool advertisement like that you're gonna do nothing I'm not gonna be explosions there

or you need more of echoes perplexing pontifications and you certainly got your share of those today but if you want more you can connect with us on the in a website on instagram which is just so echo knows what i'm talking about he calls it the gram and on facebook echo is at echo trials and i am at jocca willink and thanks to all the folks out there in uniform that are protecting the free world we are able to do what we do because of what you do and thanks to police and law enforcement fire fighters and paramedics and EMT's and dispatchers and correction officers and border patrol and secret service and all first responders two short of time at least I got that those moments, those precious moments, those unforgettable memories at least I got those and got to experience those times to know the beauty of their personality, their attitude, their outlook on the world they were all unique and I am thankful for the opportunity I had to interact with them now comes death, death is horrible and death is wretched and death is cruel and death isn't fair and I don't know why the best people seem to be taken from us first death is also inescapable there is no way out no one gets out alive death is part of life like the contrast between the darkness and the light without death there is no life and the people that I have lost they taught me that they taught me how precious life is, how blessed we are to have every day to learn, to grow, to laugh, to live to live, to live every day with purpose and passion to wake up in the morning and be thankful thankful for that morning, thankful for that opportunity to go into the world and live live for them, for those that don't have the opportunity, for those who are stolen away by death's cruel hand for them I will live, I will revere their memory and I will live live let us cry no more let us mourn no more let us remember but let us not dwell instead let us laugh and love and let us embrace and venerate everything that life is and every opportunity it gives us let us live for those who live no more let us live 200 them and that is what I tried to do then that is what I am still trying to do but I needed that bit of guidance from myself and there is even more backstory here because the book was supposed to come out October 17th 2017 that is when the book was being released and for that release of the book I had nine days of media scheduled in New York City with all the cable news networks and the syndicated radio interviews and the articles and the podcast interviews and all the stuff was set up and scheduled so people would hear about the book and of course all this stuff is what the publisher and the public sets up because they're trying to sell the book and it's the big chance to get on the New York Times bestseller list and the Wall Street Journal bestseller list and the USA today list and the Amazon list and all that and of course I know that because of the situation none of this is going to happen I know that I have to take care of my friend I have to see him off and I didn't take care of his mom and his dad and his brother and his sister so the entire nine days of media got completely canceled I did zero didn't even do my own podcast about this book in fact that's the only week where this podcast did not come out and I went to three memorial services for Seth and to his burial at Fort Rose Crans National Cemetery there was a memorial service in San Diego for the teams there was one in Houston his hometown for his Texas friends and family and there was one in Hawaii which was the location of the unit that he was attached to when he died and I had the honor of escorting his mom throughout all these events as he Seth had requested in a letter he had sent in case he died and we saw him off as best we could including going surfing and including setting something on fire at dusk which he had also requested in that letter and we burned what was left of an old surfboard that Seth had given to my son which my son had broken and we also burned an old guitar of mine that could not be tuned at least no one could tune it except for Seth somehow he could tune up a no one else could so it was of no use that's one of the pain that's what I was going to say like that's what you get taught as well and not like a secondary teaching like one of the primary thinking is like kind of how fragile you are with pain where the kind of like okay or how much you can get used to it too exactly right that's part of the training you know that's what you do benefit from taking that pain like ribs legs is a huge one man like a leg kick body kick punch even when you kick somebody and it lands in the wrong spot but it's like hurts uh so i have something to chew on but fasting isn't that hard and you will feel better at the end of it this is my favorite thing fasting will recalibrate what hunger is to you you'll realize that you aren't actually hungry most of the time you're just bored and at the end of a fast your food will taste better too that is a factual beautiful thing food tastes good when you uh when you do that so a whole section on fasting a bunch of benefits from that got a section here dealing with injuries and illness you are going to get injured you are going to get sick regardless of how careful you are in training you how clean you eat and how healthy you live you are still human injuries and illness will occur my theory for overcoming injuries and illness is simple do what you can if you're sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip or workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can hurt your knee work your upper body work the good leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm pull up some pushups focus on your core and legs until your shoulder heals up 10 to 90s from using your grip too much sounds like it's time to focus on sprinting and jumping the plyometrics got a little cold flu same thing do what you can maybe it's just going for a walk a couple sets of situps and pushups but don't just stay in bed all day now sometimes you get playing knocked out by illness or a virus if it is that bad and your body absolutely needs rest good listen to your body and take the rest also don't bring your disease to the gym and spread it around work out at home same thing with injuries if some injury prevents you from doing the physical things you like to do good do what you can work on some skills you can do pick up a guitar write a book draw paint compose a song blog create learn do something take advantage of physical injuries and sickness by doing something you don't normally have time for in other words get after it and I recently did that when I got COVID I was like yeah when it comes to stuff that like you're talking to me honest like like with me like even just like the look you know like a fall you know I tend to from time to time whatever go down certain over explanations and like all this stuff but if you regard again like this book for you like you need and you say you know just how you said it's like gonna go where you can just just pick it up and just read it you know for a minute or whatever that answer whatever you read that is for you it nit crazy though that like and that's what that's what all the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is because like that whole thing was Seth like I needed my own book I needed to go to the owner's manual this book is like the ultimate like New Year's book you know people they'll make like the New Year's Resolution you know but usually because you know how they say like a lot of most whatever I don't know that number like resolutions they'll fail after whatever amount of times. like it's a lot less a lot less it's not that it's not like the like the like the little shock that you get when you're at the range or whatever okay even even actually if you get you know you get like a good stress scenario going even in a training situation you won't really like notice big time but with those two weapons and incredible advantage can be gained if you know how to throw them in effective combinations other critical elements learned in boxing our angles movement both of which are based heavily on fortwork and speed which are utilized in both both the offense and defense of boxing with basic boxing knowledge a person can throw effective punches and avoid being punched both extremely useful assets when attempting to attempt the primary goal of self defense run boxing develops the ability to hit quickly avoid being hit and run away from the area of confrontation so that's just regular western boxing and this is sort of like again this is my recommendation if you're starting from ground zero you know nothing this is how I would go about it there can be some argument made that if you were going to a place tomorrow that you needed to be ready to begin attacked then maybe like you look at some other form of martial arts but if that's your situation like it's not smart I mean and you know by that I mean some of these I don't even know if that's a true statement okay you might need these these kind of blitz martial arts type situation like a crowd from a god you know or whatever whatever some cool system I think I would in a read actually told me that I think in a read was like you know if you had like one day I would teach somebody some basic crowd from a god stuff I do not engage in irrational theoretical discussions on which martial art is best there's no reason to theorize anymore the ultimate fighting championship put many theories to the test the war's an Iraq and Afghanistan also put many theories to the test about hand-to-hand combat finally every person now carries a video camera in their pocket and there are thousands of street fights and confrontations to watch on the internet with all that information readily available there is no need to theorize anymore it is easy to see what works and what doesn't furthermore it is also obvious that martial arts are not stagnant they evolve people develop new techniques and new moves to counter other techniques and other moves but they but the fundamental principles do not change they only become reinforced and I give some advice here start with Brazilian jujitsu it is a form of grappling that is highly advanced because for the most part the actual fighting takes place on the ground this is a key point because our first form of self-defense is to get away yes run if you are confronted by another person or a group of people the best thing you can do is run away avoid the conflict this is relatively easy if someone is trying to strike with you or strike you with punches or kicks they do not have control over you so you can simply run away from them you have one the problem comes in a self-defense situation when someone is grabbing you now they are preventing your first line of defense running as soon as someone grabs you you are in a grappling scenario and one of the most critical parts of Brazilian jujitsu is escaping someone's grip so you can run oftentimes an attacker will take you to the ground in order to prevent you from escaping their grip when this happens the ability to ground fight is used not to stay on the ground but to get up and get away from the attacker the first goal of a beginner in jujitsu is not to get the fight to the ground but to get up off the ground and get away this is an important distinction from people who believe the goal of self-defense in jujitsu is to get the attacker to the ground this is not true the goal is to get away but as has been seen over and over again fights often end up on the ground and therefore a person must be prepared for it not training in jujitsu because you don't want to go to the ground is like not learning to swim because you don't want to go in the water it doesn't make sense the safest way to deal with the water is to be comfortable in it just as being comfortable on the ground is the best way to deal with that scenario should it unfold in real life questions comments from echo trolls i agree we can reach back to your days many days on the front lines of the bouncing one I'll read through some of the stuff the the opening section is called the way of discipline people look for the shortcut the hack and if you came here looking for that you won't find it the shortcut is a lie the hack doesn't get you there and if you want to take the easy road it won't take you where you want to be stronger smarter faster healthier better free to reach goals and overcome obstacles and be the best version of you possible will not happen by itself it will not happen cutting corners taking shortcuts or looking for the easy way there is no easy way there is only hard work late nights early mornings practice rehearsal repetition study sweat blood toil frustration and discipline discipline there must be discipline discipline the route of all good qualities the driver of daily execution the core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say not today not now I need a rest I will do tomorrow what's the hack how do you become stronger smarter faster healthier how do you become better how do you achieve true freedom there is only one way the way of discipline so that's the opening of the book you know this is not there's not a this is not a verbose book you don't get paid by the word like the old newspaper writers you should get paid by the word not getting paid by the word trying to say what I'm trying to say that's it but yes it's that it's that though it's something specific where like like the other days I was I was getting one in and my son in my little dream it lasted literally like two seconds like a two second dream almost and my son like ran under my legs
