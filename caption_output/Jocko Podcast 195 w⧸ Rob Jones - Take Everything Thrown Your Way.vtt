00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.72
This is Jocopotcast number 195 with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willick. Good evening,

2
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:21.84
you're good evening. How much? How much is enough? I mean, how much does a person have to give

3
00:00:21.84 --> 00:00:33.20
before they can say that they've given enough? I think that answer is different for

4
00:00:33.20 --> 00:00:39.44
different people. There are some people that don't give very much at all. Maybe they

5
00:00:39.44 --> 00:00:49.04
give just enough to be called a participant at best. When some people don't even get there,

6
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:58.16
they aren't even in the game. But then if you go to the other end of the spectrum,

7
00:00:58.96 --> 00:01:06.96
there are other people who give and give and give and make sacrifice after sacrifice. And that's

8
00:01:06.96 --> 00:01:18.48
still isn't enough. They remain ready and willing to give even more to make more

9
00:01:18.48 --> 00:01:27.76
sacrifice. As sacrifices, that many of us can't even comprehend. And then they look up and say,

10
00:01:27.76 --> 00:01:41.20
what else can I do? These are rare people. And it's an honor to have one of those people here

11
00:01:41.20 --> 00:01:48.40
with us tonight. One of those people who has served with honor, deployed repeatedly to war zones

12
00:01:48.40 --> 00:01:59.44
and Iraq and Afghanistan, a man who suffered devastating wounds, lost both of his legs, but that didn't

13
00:01:59.44 --> 00:02:11.60
stop him. He never felt sorry for himself. Instead, he used the pain to make himself stronger and tougher

14
00:02:11.60 --> 00:02:21.36
and better. And he represented America in the Paralympic Games, bringing home the bronze metal

15
00:02:21.36 --> 00:02:26.24
for rowing. He wrote a bike across America from Maine to California to raise money for

16
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:33.52
veteran causes. But that still wasn't enough. So to raise even more money and raise more awareness

17
00:02:33.52 --> 00:02:42.40
for veterans charities, he ran 31 marathons in 31 days. And yes, you heard that correctly, 31

18
00:02:42.40 --> 00:02:55.28
marathons in 31 days. But he decided that he still hadn't given enough. And after his

19
00:02:55.28 --> 00:03:02.56
all this, all these accomplishments, his service in the Marine Corps, he still wants to serve. So now

20
00:03:04.64 --> 00:03:13.20
he's taken on another challenge. He is running for the 10th congressional seat in his home state

21
00:03:13.20 --> 00:03:21.68
of Virginia, which it might not be the toughest battle that he's ever fought, but it will certainly

22
00:03:21.68 --> 00:03:31.28
or almost certainly could be the nastiest. But you know what? He is game, of course, his name is

23
00:03:31.28 --> 00:03:38.88
Rob Jones. He's a Marine. He's a wounded warrior. He's an Olympian. He's an inspiration to everyone's

24
00:03:38.88 --> 00:03:45.60
ever met him. He's been on this podcast twice before number 92 and number 1116. So if you haven't

25
00:03:45.60 --> 00:03:54.24
listened to those, go back and do so. But if you have, well, here he is. Once again, my brother, Rob Jones.

26
00:03:54.24 --> 00:04:01.60
Rob, welcome back, man. You know, I would say that I've been asked that several times. Have

27
00:04:01.60 --> 00:04:09.36
you given enough. And I always say, it's not going to be enough until six Marines carry me in a

28
00:04:09.36 --> 00:04:19.60
coffin, put me in the ground in Arlington. So I'll make you do it. So what led you to make this decision

29
00:04:19.60 --> 00:04:27.44
to make this political run? What, what, what the hell happened? Because let's face it, signing up for

30
00:04:27.44 --> 00:04:40.16
politics. That that is like signing up for just extreme punishment, extreme mental punishment of

31
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:46.72
people coming after you all the time. People don't care about your, you know, the way it affects you,

32
00:04:46.72 --> 00:04:54.08
the way it affects your family. I mean, it gets crazy in politics. So what was it that made you

33
00:04:54.08 --> 00:04:59.60
say to yourself, okay, you know what, it's time for me to do this? Yeah, you know, I've just noticed over

34
00:04:59.60 --> 00:05:08.16
the last few years the deteriorating environment in Congress and the federal government. And

35
00:05:09.52 --> 00:05:14.72
I disall that we need leaders there. And the only way we're going to get leaders there is if

36
00:05:14.72 --> 00:05:23.36
leaders step up and they put themselves into that arena, take the risk of, you know, being under fire

37
00:05:23.36 --> 00:05:29.44
from these people, you know, kind of harkens back to, I think I talked about this last time.

38
00:05:29.44 --> 00:05:33.84
When I told it, I talked about proof the lane, kind of how I was, you know, when you

39
00:05:33.84 --> 00:05:39.76
use searching for IEDs, you have to go out there and you have to step on the ground and make sure

40
00:05:39.76 --> 00:05:44.24
that there's not an IED there. So you just kind of step on it and if it blows up, well, guess what,

41
00:05:44.24 --> 00:05:49.84
there's an IED there if it doesn't, you get to take another step. And what I learned from that is that

42
00:05:49.84 --> 00:05:58.64
in Afghanistan, every single day, and I racked to every single day, there are times, count this

43
00:05:58.64 --> 00:06:04.24
times where somebody has to step forward and do the dangerous thing, do the difficult thing for the

44
00:06:04.24 --> 00:06:11.28
good of everybody else. And life is no different. And, you know, politics is no different. Somebody has

45
00:06:11.28 --> 00:06:17.28
to step forward and take that risk and turn to the arena if we want to see meaningful change. So,

46
00:06:17.28 --> 00:06:25.12
you know, in with respect to what you said, I'm just trying to continue my service in that way

47
00:06:25.12 --> 00:06:30.000
and have the best impact I can. Yeah, well, that's definitely a different kind of mine field,

48
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.80
but it's a mine field indeed, you're stepping into. And I think one of the things in you and I

49
00:06:34.80 --> 00:06:41.04
were talking about this earlier, when I talk to people and I talk to, I do pretty good in talking

50
00:06:41.04 --> 00:06:48.32
to people from all different kind of political viewpoints. But one thing that I've seen, and I think

51
00:06:48.32 --> 00:06:55.92
this has a lot to do with kind of where we've gotten this completely divisive culture in politics,

52
00:06:56.96 --> 00:07:04.96
is that people lack humility, like the normal person that years ago, what I said, oh, well,

53
00:07:04.96 --> 00:07:11.28
let me hear you out. Now that person, a normal person, you can talk to them and they, they're

54
00:07:12.24 --> 00:07:17.44
they lack humility to say, you know what, maybe this person has a viewpoint that makes some kind

55
00:07:17.44 --> 00:07:23.20
of sense, maybe there's some portion. Instead of thinking, you know what, I am 100% right.

56
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.88
My political viewpoint is 100% right, which means that your political viewpoint is 100% 100%

57
00:07:32.88 --> 00:07:37.44
100% wrong. There's no value in anything that you're going to say, you're 100% wrong,

58
00:07:37.44 --> 00:07:43.76
and I'm 100% right. And that's the line is drawn. It's not even like the, oh, of the line gets drawn.

59
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:54.32
The line is drawn that, and it starts with, hey, I'm 19 years old or 26 years old or 38 years old,

60
00:07:54.32 --> 00:07:58.56
and I, everything that I believe is 100% right. And that means everyone else is 100% wrong.

61
00:07:58.56 --> 00:08:05.04
Unless you agree with me, if you agree with me, 100% you're okay. By the way, you've seen it on both sides,

62
00:08:06.16 --> 00:08:12.80
somebody, if somebody makes a step outside of the traditional views of the left or the

63
00:08:12.80 --> 00:08:16.16
traditional views of the right, these are people that are on the left or are on the right,

64
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:24.08
they get shredded by their own side, because everyone's attitude is, I am 100% right. You don't know anything.

65
00:08:24.08 --> 00:08:31.84
Yeah, I mean, and we have to remember, we have to be aware of what the humility piece is that nobody

66
00:08:31.84 --> 00:08:39.28
actually knows for sure. Nobody does. We have evidence, we have theories, but we don't know what's

67
00:08:39.28 --> 00:08:44.24
going to happen when we pass, you know, some legislation, and you can see that over the course of the

68
00:08:44.80 --> 00:08:48.72
entirety of our country's history, we pass the level, like, oh, this is, this is what it's going to do.

69
00:08:48.72 --> 00:08:53.12
It's going to do this, this, this, this, this, this, pass the bill, and then that that and that happens.

70
00:08:53.12 --> 00:08:58.72
You know, like, oh, unintended consequences, there's no way to predict it. So we have to go in there with the

71
00:08:58.72 --> 00:09:05.44
best knowledge that we can and all the preparation that we can, but, you know, keep in mind that we don't

72
00:09:05.44 --> 00:09:10.000
actually know everything. And we also have to remember that that person that disagrees with you,

73
00:09:12.72 --> 00:09:17.36
they just, they're just coming from a different perspective from you. You know, they, you have to,

74
00:09:17.36 --> 00:09:22.56
what it really boils down to is you both want the same thing. I think, usually, if you disagree with

75
00:09:22.56 --> 00:09:26.96
somebody, you both want, you know, the American people to have the best lives they can and have the

76
00:09:26.96 --> 00:09:33.68
most meaningful lives they can, you just want to go about it in a different way. And so, as long as you

77
00:09:33.68 --> 00:09:40.48
can maintain that attitude, like, this person really, they want the best for these people.

78
00:09:42.40 --> 00:09:45.68
And then that's how you can kind of disagree with them in a civil manner.

79
00:09:45.68 --> 00:09:52.000
Mm-hmm. What was the, who put the idea in your head? How did that, that, that, that,

80
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.88
did someone plant the seed? Did you sit in a watching TV, watching somebody speak? And you were like,

81
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:02.80
no, I got to get in this game. Yeah, you know, it was just, uh, yeah, popped into my head like a lot of

82
00:10:02.80 --> 00:10:08.000
these other crazy ideas that I have, you know, you just out one time and, you know, a lot of it has to

83
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.88
do with, I thought of the idea initially when I was training for the month of marathon's.

84
00:10:12.88 --> 00:10:16.80
So, you know, kind of always trying to think ahead of, you know, what's the next thing going to be,

85
00:10:16.80 --> 00:10:22.16
what's the next thing going to be? And I didn't do the month of marathon's to prepare me for, for this.

86
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:26.32
It was this kind of an idea that I had, like, maybe after the month of marathon's is done,

87
00:10:26.32 --> 00:10:30.24
maybe I'll, you know, take the next step and try and do a little bit more, and I'll try and run

88
00:10:30.24 --> 00:10:36.56
for Congress. And so, you know, I thought of the idea then, and then I kind of, you know, I was doing

89
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:41.52
other things. I ran the month of marathon's came back, still didn't really know what to do or whether

90
00:10:41.52 --> 00:10:48.16
or not it was possible. And then after the 2018 election, I texted a buddy that I had from,

91
00:10:48.88 --> 00:10:53.60
from the hospital named Brian Mass, who's a double above knee amputee, and I just, he ran in Florida

92
00:10:53.60 --> 00:10:58.56
for reelection, he won. So, what a sensible, a tech saying, congratulations on winning. And he said,

93
00:10:59.28 --> 00:11:04.16
send me something back saying, I loved to have you up here. Let's talk. And I was like, you know,

94
00:11:04.16 --> 00:11:09.12
what, I actually am, I have been thinking about going that route. He brought me into his office and kind of

95
00:11:09.12 --> 00:11:15.28
gave me a rundown of, you know, what it takes and what you got to do and he set me up with his consultants

96
00:11:15.28 --> 00:11:19.12
and they talked to me a little bit and like, you know what, maybe I, I think I can't do this. So,

97
00:11:19.84 --> 00:11:24.96
he kind of gave me the belief that it was going to be possible. That's awesome. All right,

98
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:30.000
let me do this. Let me dig into this a little bit because from the outside,

99
00:11:30.72 --> 00:11:34.72
what it looks like when we see people entering the political arena, it's like, all of a sudden,

100
00:11:34.72 --> 00:11:39.28
they just kind of magically appear. Right. What actually happens, you know, when you talk to your friend,

101
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:44.24
when you talk to these consultants and people start looking at you as a potential candidate,

102
00:11:44.88 --> 00:11:49.36
what does all that look like behind the scenes behind the, what do they call the sausage maker?

103
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:52.80
Right. Right. Use eat the sausage, but you don't know what's going on behind the scenes. What's

104
00:11:52.80 --> 00:11:58.56
going on behind the scenes there? Yeah. So, I think the way that I'm kind of in a unique position where

105
00:11:58.56 --> 00:12:03.36
I'm friends with Brian and he already had some folks that, you know, consult on his campaign

106
00:12:03.36 --> 00:12:08.24
that were close friends of his and they had experience, you know, they worked on previous campaigns,

107
00:12:08.24 --> 00:12:12.80
they had a lot of experience, they got him elected, but I think the vast majority of the time you,

108
00:12:13.36 --> 00:12:20.08
you know, you approach a consultant, it's a position, you do campaign consulting, that's your business.

109
00:12:20.64 --> 00:12:24.16
So, that's how it's going to make their money. They make their money through campaign consulting.

110
00:12:24.16 --> 00:12:30.48
Yeah. So, it's a business and there's consultants all over the place for everything you want to do

111
00:12:30.48 --> 00:12:38.24
in the campaign world getting elected. So, you know, in some cases, it might just be the consultant,

112
00:12:38.24 --> 00:12:42.32
you know, they just want to paycheck. They think they can, you know, get a paycheck that they can

113
00:12:42.32 --> 00:12:47.12
try and help you, but in a lot of the cases in the case here is I think they look at,

114
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.60
you know, whether or not you have a good story, whether or not you, they think you can get elected

115
00:12:53.60 --> 00:12:58.64
and they kind of believe in you as well. And so, I think when they saw me and I kind of told them

116
00:12:58.64 --> 00:13:04.88
about myself, they said, okay, here's a good story that we think can get traction and then they

117
00:13:04.88 --> 00:13:08.80
guys just, you know, it just seems like he's going to be a selfless individual and he'd be a good

118
00:13:08.80 --> 00:13:14.24
in Congress. And so, those two kind of things combined, I think, in this particular case, but, you know,

119
00:13:14.24 --> 00:13:18.000
that being said, there's a dichotomy, of course, on Jocco podcast.

120
00:13:19.92 --> 00:13:24.56
And where there might be, you know, some people that, they're just in it for the paycheck, too.

121
00:13:24.56 --> 00:13:28.96
This is the consultants are just in it for the paycheck. Sometimes, not all, I mean, I think.

122
00:13:28.96 --> 00:13:33.76
Where they can be. Yeah, I think the vast majority of the time, you know, they, they want to

123
00:13:33.76 --> 00:13:38.96
get behind somebody they believe in. What kind of process did they put you through for

124
00:13:39.92 --> 00:13:44.40
vetting you? I mean, like you said, okay, the interview, they have a good story. Your story is

125
00:13:44.40 --> 00:13:48.80
kind of public, so it's not really hard to figure out. Yeah. Did they get you, all right, we're going to

126
00:13:48.80 --> 00:13:51.92
do a Q&A with you. We're going to hammer you with question, did you all that kind of thing?

127
00:13:51.92 --> 00:13:59.28
Geek simulator? Yeah, a little bit. I, well, I met with Brian and then, you know, so I've just

128
00:13:59.28 --> 00:14:04.88
he vows for me. So, these two guys that are his friends and ran this campaigns, they, I don't

129
00:14:04.88 --> 00:14:08.96
think they really need to divet me too much more after that after Brian vows for me. But we did

130
00:14:08.96 --> 00:14:13.92
meet up and we talked a little bit. And I didn't even, honestly, I didn't even know if they were

131
00:14:13.92 --> 00:14:17.76
going to help me or not. I thought they were just kind of answering a few questions that I had,

132
00:14:17.76 --> 00:14:22.08
but then after that they, they said, yeah, we want to, we want to help you run your campaign.

133
00:14:23.04 --> 00:14:26.80
And so, yeah, I think it's just getting a feel, it's getting to know somebody, getting a, it's like,

134
00:14:26.80 --> 00:14:31.52
you know, hiring somebody for a job, you get to know who they are and they just decide if they

135
00:14:31.52 --> 00:14:35.12
want to work with you or not. And, you know, I'm lucky enough that they decide they did.

136
00:14:35.12 --> 00:14:40.72
And so then, so then what happens next? Yeah, so what happened? A big plan preparation, I mean,

137
00:14:40.72 --> 00:14:46.56
imagine they want the announcement to be a big deal, right? Yeah. So, so how did all that go down?

138
00:14:46.56 --> 00:14:52.88
Yeah, so I think I decided, you know, I committed to it and we started setting things in motion,

139
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:58.40
you know, probably in April or something like that earlier in the year. And they said, okay,

140
00:14:58.40 --> 00:15:02.24
so we're going to do an announcement. And so that's kind of a good way to get press and get

141
00:15:02.24 --> 00:15:07.04
you name out there. It's all about just getting people knowing who you are and knowing your story

142
00:15:07.04 --> 00:15:10.64
so that they can decide whether or not they think that you're a person that they can support.

143
00:15:11.28 --> 00:15:14.80
So part of that is making this big announcement because you get a lot of press coverage when you

144
00:15:14.80 --> 00:15:23.76
announce officially. So we kind of plan this out. You make a video and you prepare press and you

145
00:15:23.76 --> 00:15:27.60
do a little bit of practice with, you know, answering some of the questions you're going to get on

146
00:15:27.60 --> 00:15:33.68
announcement day. But mostly it's just about getting kind of the sausage-making stuff in place too.

147
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:41.76
You got to find, you have to, there's all sorts of rules about, you know, but the FEC, the

148
00:15:41.76 --> 00:15:47.20
Federal Election Committee or Commission or whatever. Yeah, some really crazy rules. All sorts of rules.

149
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:53.92
So next thing you do is you kind of you hire a compliance, you guys. I was going to say a

150
00:15:53.92 --> 00:15:58.56
lead team. Like somebody that knows how these things work and then you kind of prepare the paper

151
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:03.76
work to file and then you get all these, you kind of get your apparatus in place. So once you announce

152
00:16:03.76 --> 00:16:10.08
boom, it's like an assault. So some of those rules that you have to be compliant with, like you can

153
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:14.72
only take a certain amount of donations, right? I mean, with this and with, after come from certain places.

154
00:16:14.72 --> 00:16:24.08
Yeah. So individuals can only donate $2,800 per election. And then if there's a primary and a

155
00:16:24.08 --> 00:16:31.52
general election. So that's $5,600 per election cycle. But if a person donates $5,600 now,

156
00:16:31.52 --> 00:16:37.52
I can only use $2,800 for the primary and then the other $2,800, I can use in the general

157
00:16:37.52 --> 00:16:44.16
election. There's all sorts of rules. And then you can't take money from corporations unless there's,

158
00:16:44.16 --> 00:16:49.52
you can take money from a pack, a political action committee. They can only donate $10,000. And then

159
00:16:50.16 --> 00:16:56.16
there's things called superpacks that are kind of their own entity. You can't talk with them. They

160
00:16:56.16 --> 00:17:02.48
can support you, but you can't talk directly with them. So you can't like plan things out with them.

161
00:17:02.48 --> 00:17:06.000
But they can kind of pick up on what you're doing in your commercials and your advertisements

162
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.96
and they can kind of into it what they should do to help your campaign. But you can't work directly

163
00:17:10.96 --> 00:17:17.28
with them. So yeah, there's also, and then usually what you'll do is you'll fly me out and you'll pay

164
00:17:17.28 --> 00:17:21.84
for a really, really nice hotel. So you're talking about when you're talking about you, you're saying

165
00:17:21.84 --> 00:17:28.08
Jocco podcast. Jocco on the fort. It's like, hey, yeah, we, we fly you out here and pay for your hotel.

166
00:17:28.08 --> 00:17:34.32
It's really real nice. Yeah, get you dinner or whatever. But since I'm coming and I'm talking about

167
00:17:34.32 --> 00:17:40.08
being a political candidate, if I want, if you, if I want to do to pay for the, for my travel out here,

168
00:17:40.08 --> 00:17:45.36
then you have to do like some kind of in kind donation paperwork and all sorts of stuff. So,

169
00:17:45.92 --> 00:17:49.28
yeah, there's this all of these different rules. So you kind of have to have somebody that you can

170
00:17:50.08 --> 00:17:54.96
send an email to really quick. Can we, can we do this? And they say, you probably shouldn't,

171
00:17:55.36 --> 00:17:59.28
or they, and they handle the, the filing of the paperwork and they do all that. And they handle

172
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:05.44
all my donations that come in. So there's so many rules that donations. So all the donations,

173
00:18:05.44 --> 00:18:11.12
if it's a check, they go down to this guy where he is, he reviews it, make sure you have all the

174
00:18:11.12 --> 00:18:16.08
stuff like over $200 people have to report their employment information and that kind of thing.

175
00:18:16.64 --> 00:18:20.64
And then so he makes sure you have all the stuff and it's okay. This is a valid donation.

176
00:18:20.64 --> 00:18:24.40
We donate that. And if one comes in without the right stuff, and he's like, this is invalid.

177
00:18:24.40 --> 00:18:30.000
And you can't have it. How big is the staff that you have? I mean, this sounds like,

178
00:18:30.64 --> 00:18:37.12
I mean, a decent sized operation. Yeah. I mean, it's, and right now it's kind of a skeleton crew

179
00:18:37.12 --> 00:18:43.04
for the most part. I have my consultants who have been with me, you know, since a before I even announced,

180
00:18:43.04 --> 00:18:48.32
we have the compliance guy. We have digital consultants that kind of do websites and

181
00:18:49.28 --> 00:18:54.16
they kind of handle some of the digital fundraising stuff. And then I have an individual

182
00:18:54.16 --> 00:19:01.84
person fundraiser. So this somebody that knows has a lot of personal connections as experience

183
00:19:01.84 --> 00:19:07.28
raising money, you know, for political campaigns and other stuff. So I have her. And then she kind

184
00:19:07.28 --> 00:19:15.20
of helps me raise with the raising money. And then I also have the compliance guy. And then eventually

185
00:19:15.20 --> 00:19:20.16
you kind of bring on more and more people like a campaign manager and as time goes on. But yes,

186
00:19:20.16 --> 00:19:23.92
so you kind of right now we have a skeleton crew and then we're just going to keep building and building.

187
00:19:23.92 --> 00:19:29.68
And, and they're obviously raising money is is, unfortunately.

188
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:37.04
That's basically how you get elected. I mean, it's, it's got to be a giant percentage of

189
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.92
the mechanism that gets elected. So if you don't get, if you don't raise enough money,

190
00:19:41.92 --> 00:19:45.92
you don't even get the platform to say what, for people to hear what it is that you're going

191
00:19:45.92 --> 00:19:50.64
to do, what you're going to say, what your beliefs are. So you kind of have to get this

192
00:19:50.64 --> 00:19:58.80
money raising machine moving. Yeah. So it's more, it's more, more for some people less for other

193
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:07.04
people important. So the better story you have, the less money you're going to need to get your

194
00:20:07.04 --> 00:20:12.16
story out there. And you know, I kind of have an advantage where people have kind of heard of me,

195
00:20:12.16 --> 00:20:17.20
you know, people aren't coming up to me every day and you know, asking who I am or anything. But

196
00:20:17.20 --> 00:20:22.48
when somebody hears the guy that ran through a marathon, I was like, oh yeah, I know that guy.

197
00:20:22.48 --> 00:20:29.92
And then so I can kind of put the face to that, to that name. But yeah, so the, the big part of it is

198
00:20:30.80 --> 00:20:36.64
people knowing that you're running, knowing you exist, knowing enough about you to decide whether

199
00:20:36.64 --> 00:20:41.36
or not they want to vote for you. And so you have to look at how we'll help you, how do people

200
00:20:41.36 --> 00:20:45.76
get their information? They get it through watching TV, they get it through doing through

201
00:20:45.76 --> 00:20:51.92
the paper, they're going online, podcasts, you know, things of that nature, Facebook ads,

202
00:20:51.92 --> 00:20:57.92
things like that. And so all those things cost money. So if you want, you're not going to go up to,

203
00:20:57.92 --> 00:21:04.56
you know, my district has 800,000 people in it. And if I went to every single house for 10 minutes,

204
00:21:04.56 --> 00:21:10.56
that's what, 8 million minutes. There's just not that many minutes. And so, you know, you should

205
00:21:10.56 --> 00:21:16.16
run your 31 minutes. Yeah, 31 minutes. Yeah, it's around in circles right now. I know, I would. But yeah,

206
00:21:16.16 --> 00:21:19.76
so as I, how do people get their information? And that's, that's the way they do it. All those things

207
00:21:20.72 --> 00:21:27.84
they cost money. And in the DC area, especially, they cost a lot of money. And then, in order to get

208
00:21:27.84 --> 00:21:33.04
your face and name out there at the most optimum time, the most efficient time, cost even more money.

209
00:21:33.04 --> 00:21:39.84
If you want to have your ad on, you know, during Fox News or whatever in the morning, that cost a lot more

210
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:45.84
money. So yeah, so unfortunately, it's one of those things that you have to raise the money in order

211
00:21:45.84 --> 00:21:50.32
to just to get your name out there, so people know you exist. So what is the, what is the process

212
00:21:50.88 --> 00:21:55.60
from here on out? What does it look like? I mean, take me all the way, well, as to the best of your

213
00:21:55.60 --> 00:22:00.56
knowledge, what happens next? So your, your obviously you spend the next however many months,

214
00:22:00.56 --> 00:22:04.56
raising money to get this thing going forward. What does it rest of this time look like? Yeah, so

215
00:22:04.56 --> 00:22:11.28
you want to make milestones along the way, bring you to Election Day victory. Oh, yeah, the money

216
00:22:11.28 --> 00:22:17.52
raising now. So kind of your first quarter that you raise is kind of a bit of an indicator, like

217
00:22:17.52 --> 00:22:22.88
if you raise enough money in the first quarter, that's a lot of people kind of use that as a gauge

218
00:22:22.88 --> 00:22:28.24
on how much of a chance you have. And so that's kind of something. So you want to get, you want to

219
00:22:28.24 --> 00:22:33.68
have a good raise in your first quarter. When did your first quarter start? July 1st. So it's good

220
00:22:33.68 --> 00:22:37.68
kind of goes on the fiscal quarters. Okay. So July 1st is September 30th. So we're kind of coming

221
00:22:37.68 --> 00:22:41.44
up to it. And then I'm kind of at a little bit of a disadvantage because we did our announcement

222
00:22:41.44 --> 00:22:46.000
on the same be that I got Wundo, which was July 22nd, kind of to make the announcement a little

223
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.20
bit more special. Right. And so we kind of, so you gave up. Give up three weeks. Yeah. And so,

224
00:22:51.92 --> 00:22:56.48
yeah, so that's one milestone. And then while you're doing that, you're raising money,

225
00:22:56.48 --> 00:23:02.32
raise your money and then it's going to first quarter right now. It's going to be, it's been a

226
00:23:02.32 --> 00:23:08.88
little bit difficult because there's a lot of different factors. It's summertime. So people are,

227
00:23:08.88 --> 00:23:15.20
you know, on vacation. There's also a local election in Virginia coming up. So a lot of people are kind

228
00:23:15.20 --> 00:23:20.48
of more focused on that than are really focusing on next year yet, understandably so. And then at

229
00:23:20.48 --> 00:23:26.96
the same time, I don't, I'm my politician. You know, I have no political apparatus before this.

230
00:23:26.96 --> 00:23:31.28
And a lot of people that run for office at this level, you know, they've ran for county seat.

231
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:36.40
Then they run for state seat. And they run another state seat. So they have, you know, people that

232
00:23:36.40 --> 00:23:40.64
have donated to them consistently over the years. So they can kind of go back to these people

233
00:23:41.68 --> 00:23:46.08
over and over again every time they have an election. So they have those people that have already

234
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:50.08
donated, so they can raise money kind of quit. I don't have that. So I kind of have to build that

235
00:23:50.08 --> 00:23:55.68
donor base from scratch. The other thing that I must imagine is a little bit weird is like

236
00:23:55.68 --> 00:24:04.96
learning how to ask for money. I mean, I know I feel weird to ask anyone for help at anything.

237
00:24:04.96 --> 00:24:08.80
Right? The guy would rather just do something myself than have to say, hey, could I help?

238
00:24:08.80 --> 00:24:12.88
Maybe that's an ego thing a little bit of, hey, I don't need anyone to help. Maybe it's an ego

239
00:24:12.88 --> 00:24:18.72
thing of, I don't want to give that person the little one up on me. You know, I don't want to,

240
00:24:18.72 --> 00:24:23.60
that's, but also, you know, it's just like being self-sufficient, right? And not wanting to ask

241
00:24:23.60 --> 00:24:29.12
for a handout. I mean, even when we started this podcast, there was the whole, the whole,

242
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:35.44
what is it? Like donation thing was out there, right? It was out there. It was kind of a thing.

243
00:24:35.44 --> 00:24:40.64
And there was a lot of people that that's how they were running their podcast was by just taking

244
00:24:40.64 --> 00:24:46.96
donations. And we, we actually still have like a little thing where you can, you can don't want to

245
00:24:46.96 --> 00:24:50.32
have something on the website where you can donate through PayPal or something like that. Then we've

246
00:24:50.32 --> 00:24:56.40
had a couple people that have done that, but we probably talked about it twice or whatever,

247
00:24:56.40 --> 00:25:05.20
like barely ever. Because to me, it feels kind of weird to say, hey, hey, can you give me some money,

248
00:25:05.20 --> 00:25:10.56
right? And honestly, when we first started trying to, when we were first talking about

249
00:25:11.28 --> 00:25:15.52
how we would get money to buy what we're doing, to support what we're doing,

250
00:25:15.52 --> 00:25:20.24
I said, you know, well, maybe we just make some t-shirts, you know, and you're like, yeah,

251
00:25:20.24 --> 00:25:25.44
we can make t-shirts all day. Cool. Because that way, where, you know, we're not just saying,

252
00:25:25.44 --> 00:25:29.60
give me something, right? We're saying, hey, you buy this thing and it helps support.

253
00:25:31.52 --> 00:25:39.04
So you got, you had to overcome the, the idea of I'm going to ask people for money.

254
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:47.76
Yeah. It's extremely, it's very, very, very much. And yeah, so what you do first is you go to friends

255
00:25:47.76 --> 00:25:53.76
and family and you say, look, I'm thinking about that's another one of the rules. You can't say

256
00:25:53.92 --> 00:25:58.80
before you went out, you can't say you're actually running, you can only say I'm strongly considering

257
00:25:58.80 --> 00:26:04.24
running for Congress. Would you donate, if I do decide to do this, even if you've already,

258
00:26:04.80 --> 00:26:08.32
you know, decided that you're going to, you can't actually say it because then you technically,

259
00:26:08.32 --> 00:26:12.96
you have to file. So all you can say is I'm, you see, so you go to your mom, your dad,

260
00:26:12.96 --> 00:26:17.76
your close friends and family, I'm strongly considering running for Congress. I'm laughing because

261
00:26:17.76 --> 00:26:22.56
in my family, those are the last people you'd be asking for money. I don't ask, but, you know,

262
00:26:22.56 --> 00:26:26.88
that's not happening. We're getting zero from friends. My first two calls were my dad and then my

263
00:26:26.88 --> 00:26:31.92
mom. Yeah, that's so they were, they were supportive. And then you just kind of slow the call

264
00:26:31.92 --> 00:26:35.84
through your friends and family, like every phone, every phone number you have in your phone,

265
00:26:35.84 --> 00:26:40.08
you know, like, so I started with kind of people that I talked to regularly. You know,

266
00:26:40.08 --> 00:26:44.08
I'll believe what you donate and they say yes. And then you kind of just go through.

267
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:49.04
And that's kind of weird, too, because now you're like asking the question, but not even close

268
00:26:49.04 --> 00:26:52.16
the next one. And you're going to go back to the best. You have to go back to the purpose of saying that.

269
00:26:52.16 --> 00:26:56.16
What's the purpose? Just to, do you go back to your consultants and say, hey, listen, I'm getting up,

270
00:26:56.16 --> 00:27:02.32
I'm getting a 50% feedback that people will donate. Yeah, well, the thing about asking people for donations is,

271
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:08.88
I had a good buddy, a good name, Frank, that I called him. I texted him or called him or whatever before

272
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:12.000
I had, and I said, I'm going to think about running for Congress, will you donate? He's like, oh, yeah,

273
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.16
definitely. I will definitely donate. And then I'm saying, okay, well, we're trying to donate.

274
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:20.88
I get everybody to donate on Monday. We want everybody to donate on Monday because we want to raise

275
00:27:20.88 --> 00:27:25.60
a bunch of money like on day one. So that's kind of a thing in the political sphere. You'll see,

276
00:27:25.60 --> 00:27:30.56
like I think recently, a couple of the Democratic presidential candidates, they announced and they said,

277
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:35.20
oh, we raised hundreds of thousands of dollars on day one. And they think that's really cool.

278
00:27:35.20 --> 00:27:41.60
And it's kind of a big deal. And so I say, trying to get everybody to donate on Monday, July 22nd,

279
00:27:42.40 --> 00:27:47.60
you know, if I run or whatever. So then my fund, I gave my fundraiser all the

280
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:53.12
text messages that I contacted. She sent them all a text on Monday reminding him, here's the link.

281
00:27:54.40 --> 00:27:59.04
And then this guy, Frank, he didn't donate. And then so I called him again, you know, a week later,

282
00:27:59.04 --> 00:28:04.40
like, hey, just wanted to remind you, you know, I've announced now raising money. And he calls me back

283
00:28:04.40 --> 00:28:09.68
a couple of weeks later and he says, okay, I finally donated. And I said, and he wrote, he, he, uh,

284
00:28:10.40 --> 00:28:17.52
he was calling me. Yeah, yeah, something. And he runs the rowing program for UVA,

285
00:28:17.52 --> 00:28:21.36
the men's rowing program. And so he has to get a lot of donations. I said, so all you got any,

286
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.92
got any tips for me on raising money, you know, how to ask for money. I'm not very good at it.

287
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:31.44
And you said, listen, you got to remember, I'm a close friend. And it took me three weeks and three

288
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:38.80
reminders to donate to you. So you hit somebody up the first time. And they want to support you, but

289
00:28:38.80 --> 00:28:43.84
you just hit them, you know, when they're about to get in the car or, you know, they're,

290
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:46.88
take drop in the kids off at school or something like that. And they just forget, you know,

291
00:28:46.88 --> 00:28:50.16
and see, you got to remind them again. And then you see, you kind of have to make sure you hit them

292
00:28:50.16 --> 00:28:54.80
at the right time where they're okay. I'm just sitting around watching TV or whatever, eating dinner,

293
00:28:54.80 --> 00:29:00.72
I can do it right now. So you kind of have to just keep following up with people. So you,

294
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.48
friends of family first, and then once you get through all that, then you start kind of calling,

295
00:29:08.16 --> 00:29:12.08
people that have donated previously. So you kind of, you can get these lists.

296
00:29:12.08 --> 00:29:17.36
I'm sitting here trying to think if you, if what you hit me up before, I didn't get you on this

297
00:29:17.36 --> 00:29:22.64
event. You hit me up. I think you said, hey, I'm going to run or I'm thinking about it for Congress.

298
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:27.84
Maybe I could come back on the podcast. And I was like, oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I think I don't think

299
00:29:27.84 --> 00:29:31.36
you actually hit me up for the cash though. I didn't hit you up for the cash because

300
00:29:32.24 --> 00:29:36.80
friendship capital, like on a like a leadership capital. Okay. Yeah, I figure you're kind of

301
00:29:36.80 --> 00:29:41.28
already helping me out. So you, you've helped me out this so much already with, have me on, you know,

302
00:29:41.28 --> 00:29:44.56
before the month, the month, the month, the month, the month and all that stuff. And now you're going

303
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:49.44
to help me out again with this podcast. And I just kind of figure, you know, I don't want to ask too much of

304
00:29:49.44 --> 00:29:54.000
you. Well, right on, but you're not going to get anything if you don't ask. Yeah, exactly. I'm saying

305
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.68
over here. Not to mention that. That's the thing that you remember too. You have to ask even though it's

306
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:09.12
uncomfortable. So yeah, then you start. You start a product. Can you sell a t-shirt and use that,

307
00:30:09.12 --> 00:30:15.44
the profits from that? I don't know. I'm not sure. I'd have to ask. What about personal money?

308
00:30:15.44 --> 00:30:19.52
Like, you always get about the rich politicians, they just spend a lot of money. You can sell fun as much as you want.

309
00:30:19.52 --> 00:30:24.56
So you can donate to your campaign as much as you want. But if you're doing, I don't, you know,

310
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:28.56
I don't have enough money anyway. So it wouldn't really be a drop in the bucket for me to sell

311
00:30:28.56 --> 00:30:33.20
all the cars. So in carrots, yeah, for me. It's not enough carrots to pay for this.

312
00:30:35.84 --> 00:30:39.92
We did just start getting eggs. So maybe that'll be, you know, something that we can add to it. But

313
00:30:41.44 --> 00:30:44.72
yes, why simply just don't have enough money. But yeah, there's some people that take

314
00:30:44.72 --> 00:30:52.96
mortgages out on their homes. And they kind of loan the campaign $200, $300,000. And then

315
00:30:54.24 --> 00:30:58.88
they get paid back after they really start raising money. I can't do that either because I don't

316
00:30:58.88 --> 00:31:03.52
have a mortgage on my home because it was given to me by a new veteran charity. So there's no mortgage.

317
00:31:03.52 --> 00:31:09.68
And I can't take out a mortgage for five years as a part of our contract. But yeah, so

318
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:14.80
yes, the people close to you, they donate. And then you start kind of going through these lists of

319
00:31:14.80 --> 00:31:20.16
people that have donated to campaigns before. They're politically active. A lot of the times they

320
00:31:20.16 --> 00:31:24.40
have a little bit more cash to spare. You start calling them. But that's unpleasant too because a

321
00:31:24.40 --> 00:31:29.68
lot of the times it's just cold calls. And you go, you know, you have to listen to it. This is,

322
00:31:29.68 --> 00:31:35.60
yeah, this is me. So my fundraiser, she just basically just sends me call sheets. So she gets

323
00:31:35.60 --> 00:31:40.56
these lists of, it's all publicly available if they donate averse certain amount. So this goes online.

324
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.44
They, they donate to this other Republican candidate for this other Democratic candidate. So they

325
00:31:45.44 --> 00:31:50.08
might like you. So you just kind of, and there's a bunch of phone numbers on there. And a lot of the

326
00:31:50.08 --> 00:31:56.56
times it doesn't work. Or it's like a main number to their business. And you kind of have to go in and

327
00:31:56.56 --> 00:32:01.76
go into the directory and call it. And you call them up and you just go, you know, you do your little

328
00:32:01.76 --> 00:32:10.40
22nd spiel. How many of these phone calls have you made? Oh, and it's like my schedule is 9 to 11

329
00:32:10.80 --> 00:32:18.40
campaign fundraising phone calls work out at 11, eat lunch at 12, 1 to 3, make phone calls. What are you

330
00:32:18.40 --> 00:32:24.72
doing from 430 in the morning until 9? 430 in more until 9. Usually 430 to 630,

331
00:32:24.72 --> 00:32:31.84
cutting old saw and logs. And then 7 is usually when I start, I'll start reading.

332
00:32:31.84 --> 00:32:36.88
Or I'll start doing some writing, kind of flushing out my thoughts on things. And then between

333
00:32:36.88 --> 00:32:42.000
7 and 9. Because you can't call people for 9 to clock at that. So 9 to 11 you're making phone calls.

334
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And then you said from 1 to 3 you're also making phone calls. Yeah, if I have a hammering through a list.

335
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.08
Yeah. So my fundraiser will sell me 20, 25 at a time. And these lists and you just kind of look at it.

336
00:32:52.08 --> 00:32:57.44
This is what's the contact rate? Very low. If you make 100 calls, how many people do you talk to?

337
00:32:58.72 --> 00:33:08.48
I'd say maybe 10 like directly when I call 10% of the chance of you have of me picking up a

338
00:33:08.48 --> 00:33:12.88
phone phone number. I don't recognize is zero. Yeah, exactly. It's zero. And a lot of

339
00:33:12.88 --> 00:33:16.88
it's not what you do is you call and the vast majority of the time you're calling their place to work.

340
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:27.52
And so they have an assistant. And so you have to kind of... You have to kind of craft a little script almost.

341
00:33:27.52 --> 00:33:33.92
That gets them to... That kind of intrigues them. And it has to be short because you can't be too long.

342
00:33:33.92 --> 00:33:40.000
Oh, when I first started out I was doing this for 30 seconds. Okay. Let's hear it. All right. So ring ring ring.

343
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.04
I'll call Echo. Ring ring ring ring. Hello. Oh, hi. This is Rob Jones. I'm calling for Mr. Charles. Yes,

344
00:33:47.04 --> 00:33:51.20
is it? Oh, hi, Mr. Charles. My name is Rob Jones. I'm a wooden ring from Middleberg, Virginia.

345
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.68
And I'm calling today because I'm running for Congress in Virginia's 10th District. And

346
00:33:55.68 --> 00:34:00.000
this is how many you might have a few minutes to speak with me about my campaign to see if you

347
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.08
might be willing to support me. Yeah. And that's what I said. Yeah. Pretty straightforward. Yeah. So

348
00:34:06.08 --> 00:34:11.76
I kind of... And it's been kind of... And your fundraiser, they're kind of good at that. So they

349
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:16.16
kind of advise you on what to say. And so I kind of when I first started out I kind of had like this

350
00:34:17.04 --> 00:34:22.64
minute long monologue. They're like, hello. Hi, I'm Rob Jones. And I ran 31 marathon 31 days.

351
00:34:22.64 --> 00:34:27.04
And I did all this stuff. And then I'd buy the end of it. You know, they haven't spoken like a minute and a half.

352
00:34:27.04 --> 00:34:32.16
You know, so you got to bring that down. We're not with life. And I wrote extreme ownership.

353
00:34:32.16 --> 00:34:37.12
Then we did our first event that the book was at. And it's a big event. Or it's like maybe

354
00:34:38.08 --> 00:34:45.20
1,000 to 1,500 people there. And we got done. We got offstage. And they had a bunch of books for us to

355
00:34:45.20 --> 00:34:50.80
sell. And people were going to buy. And then they could we could sign them. And as soon as we got off

356
00:34:50.80 --> 00:34:57.52
stage, it was like, mayhem. Everyone was really fired up. And here's this brand new book. And

357
00:34:57.52 --> 00:35:03.44
the big message you just come from us. And so the end they got the two little tables for us to sign on.

358
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:11.20
There's a stack of books for us to to give to the people. And the very first person. And you know,

359
00:35:11.20 --> 00:35:18.64
let life like the joke is that life is like a nice person. And I'm not. And so the first

360
00:35:19.76 --> 00:35:23.68
immediately as I looked at the line, this was, you know, one of the, this is like one of the

361
00:35:23.68 --> 00:35:28.24
few things that I'm naturally gifted at. Like looking at a scenario and kind of figure not really

362
00:35:28.24 --> 00:35:35.04
quick what needs to happen to get this done. So I see people lined up. And I say to myself,

363
00:35:35.04 --> 00:35:40.40
all right, I need to be signing these books as fast as humanly possible. So I immediately start signing

364
00:35:40.40 --> 00:35:46.08
the extreme ownership book, just own it, Jocco. That's that's all I'm right. Yeah. So I get like

365
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:50.32
two, three people. Hey, I don't like to meet a gym gym, own it, Jocco, boom, hand it to life, boom.

366
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:56.96
Next person, I get through five or six people. And all of a sudden, there's all, there's a,

367
00:35:56.96 --> 00:36:04.08
there's a, there's a, there's a roadblock right next to me. His name is Lave Babin. And he's such a nice guy

368
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:09.36
that, you know, he says, hey, Jim, how you doing? Where about you from? And you know, the person's like,

369
00:36:09.36 --> 00:36:14.80
I'm from wherever I'm from Maryland. Ah, you know, I went to Naval Academy up there,

370
00:36:15.20 --> 00:36:18.64
that was man, what a beautiful thing. So what, you know, what would you do for living? And he's

371
00:36:18.64 --> 00:36:24.80
having legit conversation. And then he's right, you know, Jim, so good to talk with another person

372
00:36:24.80 --> 00:36:28.40
that, you know, grew up in the fine state of Maryland and I appreciate the support that you all

373
00:36:28.40 --> 00:36:31.92
gave us when I was up there going to Naval Academy. And I hope that everything goes well with your

374
00:36:31.92 --> 00:36:42.64
business. Appreciate it. Lead and win. And man, it took him, it was like, it took him, by the time

375
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:48.24
he, I had handed him the, the, you know, 17th book and he wasn't done with his first one. He just,

376
00:36:48.24 --> 00:36:56.08
he started writing lead wins and they're not. But yeah, you know, it's like the, the, the, the ability to

377
00:36:56.08 --> 00:37:02.80
really be nice in a situation like that is a little bit tougher. And also, you know, people,

378
00:37:02.80 --> 00:37:05.92
but you don't want to waste people's time. You know what I mean? You know, you got to get to the point,

379
00:37:05.92 --> 00:37:10.24
like you said, you got to get, you got to get at least the initial message of, hey, this is who I am.

380
00:37:10.24 --> 00:37:14.24
And this is what I'm doing. And do you want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah. And I got,

381
00:37:14.24 --> 00:37:20.40
it's a strange balance because I want to, I want to keep it short, but also say something that

382
00:37:20.40 --> 00:37:24.96
makes them give me the benefit of the doubt. Yeah. So it's kind of figuring out what that is. And I decided

383
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.32
saying I'm a wounded Marine running for Congress. That was kind of a good balance of that. Well,

384
00:37:30.32 --> 00:37:36.96
that's a big statement, right? That's it. You're in the Marine Corps. You obviously have served.

385
00:37:36.96 --> 00:37:41.28
You have made sacrifices for your country already. And now you're willing to serve more. That's a

386
00:37:41.28 --> 00:37:46.16
pretty big. That's a, that's a short statement, but it's also, it cares. There's a lot of meeting

387
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:51.04
behind it. There's a lot of weight behind it. Yeah. Okay. So I'm still sitting here thinking myself

388
00:37:51.44 --> 00:37:56.64
from a efficiency perspective. You don't have some other three people that are dialing through

389
00:37:56.64 --> 00:38:00.72
and being like, okay, Rob, we got to live one boom and hand in you the phone. Not really. I mean,

390
00:38:01.44 --> 00:38:07.84
sometimes my, my fundraisers will have relationships with some people. And she'll say, I've already

391
00:38:07.84 --> 00:38:11.92
talked to this guy. Just, you just got to call him and talk to him for a couple of minutes and

392
00:38:11.92 --> 00:38:17.52
he's probably going to donate. But yeah, I guess, you know, the way that it works is people probably

393
00:38:17.52 --> 00:38:21.60
aren't going to talk to you if you don't call him directly. Yeah. I'm going to tell you what, don't

394
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:26.32
ever, I'll donate to your campaign. Don't give my number to any of those lists. I don't want anyone

395
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:31.04
else calling me. Well, the best thing about how much you donate. Yeah, depending on how much you donate,

396
00:38:31.04 --> 00:38:37.12
you just put victories, phone numbers or put, yeah, you've got to put a phone number at some point. And

397
00:38:37.12 --> 00:38:44.88
I'm going to try and tell this, um, do without, without dropping any dimes on anyone or anything. But

398
00:38:44.88 --> 00:38:51.44
anyways, there was a, an organization and it's not really a charity organization. But somehow,

399
00:38:51.44 --> 00:38:58.64
I had donated money to this organization a long time ago. And so they would call me consistently

400
00:38:58.64 --> 00:39:02.24
all the time. And when they would call my house, I would put them on speaker phones. So my whole

401
00:39:02.24 --> 00:39:08.72
family could be entertained by what I would say. But anyways, they called one time and they say,

402
00:39:09.60 --> 00:39:13.68
oh, this is, we're looking for Mr. Willink. I said, yeah, this is, now this is,

403
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:19.44
blah, blah, blah, blah, and we're, you know, it's fundraising time again and we're, we're looking to

404
00:39:19.44 --> 00:39:25.12
up the numbers this year. And this is one of my got a phone speaker phone. And I don't, I forget the

405
00:39:25.12 --> 00:39:29.68
years it was, but the, the girl says, and I'm looking at your, our records right now and it looks like

406
00:39:29.68 --> 00:39:39.04
the last time you donate was eight years ago, you donated $10. And I was like, yeah, I said,

407
00:39:39.04 --> 00:39:44.08
why don't you call me in another eight years and we'll re-op that figure. So I like that. So yeah,

408
00:39:44.08 --> 00:39:49.12
don't get my name. Don't mind number on that. I wouldn't, I would never give out anybody's phone

409
00:39:49.12 --> 00:39:54.16
number, but if they don't, if they donate and they report it, then there's a number here and that's

410
00:39:54.16 --> 00:40:00.88
how you get it. But yeah, so that's, that's kind of where people are coming from with, they get

411
00:40:00.88 --> 00:40:06.48
donation calls all the time. And I'm just another guy. So you have to figure out how to make yourself

412
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:12.16
unique and get through that kind of guardedness in the very beginning that, you know, they're,

413
00:40:12.16 --> 00:40:17.12
they're automatically probably going to say, no, you know, I get, this is the 50th call I've gotten.

414
00:40:17.12 --> 00:40:20.96
Right. And I'm busy. I'm calling them and work. And these people, a lot of the times, you know,

415
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:25.36
they're a little bit wealthier. So it's not like they just got all their wealth by sitting around,

416
00:40:25.36 --> 00:40:32.96
watching Netflix, you know, they are working. They're working hard. So yeah, you kind of have to figure

417
00:40:32.96 --> 00:40:37.12
out away. And a lot of the times it'll be, I'll talk to an assistant and then she'll say, well,

418
00:40:37.12 --> 00:40:42.08
no, they're not available or they're not here because they're working. I don't leave a message

419
00:40:42.08 --> 00:40:46.48
to throw or I'll leave a voicemail on their phone. And then I give it a week. If I have an email

420
00:40:46.48 --> 00:40:49.68
address for them, I'll send them a follow-up email and you can be a little bit more of a boast and an

421
00:40:49.68 --> 00:40:54.96
email. So I kind of like that where I can kind of mention the 31 marathons and be a little bit

422
00:40:54.96 --> 00:40:59.04
more of a boast there. Send them a follow-up email if they don't reply to that, then I'll call them

423
00:40:59.04 --> 00:41:03.04
again. And you just kind of have to, you have a spreadsheet of people you call and you're like,

424
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:06.24
call them, okay, I call this person 10 days ago. So today's another good idea.

425
00:41:06.24 --> 00:41:11.52
And what's weird to me is you could call a billionaire who goes, oh, I absolutely want to support you.

426
00:41:11.52 --> 00:41:18.24
I got your back 100% I was in the Marine Corps. I was wounded as well in Korea or in Vietnam.

427
00:41:18.24 --> 00:41:22.80
And you got my support and all you can get from his 20 hundred bucks. Yeah, exactly.

428
00:41:24.80 --> 00:41:28.80
But yeah, and some other elections like in state elections, if a billionaire likes you,

429
00:41:28.80 --> 00:41:31.84
you can give you a billion dollars if you want, but federal elections can't do that.

430
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:38.32
So yeah, that's, and it's stuff. So you got a call and call and call and call and call and then you

431
00:41:38.32 --> 00:41:44.40
got to do stuff to get your name out there. And at some point will it beat Will someone else start

432
00:41:44.40 --> 00:41:53.84
making calls for you? Not really. I mean, so Brian who just continues to help it help me a lot of

433
00:41:53.84 --> 00:41:59.12
different ways, he'll make calls like he has, he has donors that he goes doing. So lately he's been

434
00:41:59.12 --> 00:42:03.04
making a few calls to their donors, to his donors and saying, you know, let me tell you about this guy

435
00:42:03.04 --> 00:42:07.84
Rob Jones, where you consider talking to him. And they say, yes, you're having call me. So then I call them.

436
00:42:07.84 --> 00:42:13.76
So in a way, yeah. And then if, yeah, I mean, if somebody knows somebody that they think would be

437
00:42:13.76 --> 00:42:18.88
interested in speaking to me and doing to my campaign, they'll call them. But a lot of these people,

438
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:24.80
nobody knows. And so, and a lot of the times my fundraiser should set me up with people that are

439
00:42:24.80 --> 00:42:30.000
more likely to see things that are more likely to do. And I like I've called several Marines,

440
00:42:30.64 --> 00:42:37.20
you know, or other veterans. And yeah. And so they have that connection with me immediately because

441
00:42:37.20 --> 00:42:41.36
we're both veterans. So they're more willing to talk to me. It seems to me like it would be a good

442
00:42:41.36 --> 00:42:50.48
idea to get someone else to call for two reasons. Number one, efficiency of your time. But number two,

443
00:42:51.44 --> 00:42:57.20
it's kind of like it's easier for someone else to brag about you than it is for you to brag about

444
00:42:57.20 --> 00:43:01.44
yourself. Yeah. Yeah. For someone to call up and say, hey, how you doing? My name is Jocca Willink.

445
00:43:01.44 --> 00:43:07.36
And I'm actually not calling for myself. I'm calling for a great friend of mine that is a former

446
00:43:07.36 --> 00:43:13.52
Marine. He was wounded in Afghanistan. And he's actually not done serving yet. He's running for

447
00:43:13.52 --> 00:43:19.92
Congress here in the great state of Virginia. And I was wondering if you could maybe help out or

448
00:43:19.92 --> 00:43:26.16
are interested in supporting what he's doing. Like it seems like that would be kind of a good way to do it.

449
00:43:26.16 --> 00:43:30.88
Yeah. No, I agree with you. And you have to have, you know, outside the box ideas like that.

450
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:36.88
Because the instinct is, well, because my first instinct is, oh, that's awesome that you're doing

451
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:42.48
it yourself. Like that really shows like if you personally called me, I'd be more apt. But then I thought

452
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:48.16
about it well, maybe, but someone else called me and saying, hey, this guy's running. He's a great guy.

453
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:54.24
It's sort of a, it seems like that would be helpful as well. I'm not sure if you can't pay manager. So

454
00:43:54.24 --> 00:44:00.32
the consultants, hey, back off everyone, you get no mad at me right now. No, I don't tell Rob not to do that.

455
00:44:00.32 --> 00:44:09.36
Yeah. No, I think the main difference is probably that the fundraiser kind of knows that these people

456
00:44:09.36 --> 00:44:13.36
might not go for that kind of thing. But what you're talking about, I think would work great

457
00:44:13.36 --> 00:44:17.36
on kind of the more of a grassroots level where you're trying to call a lot of people and get

458
00:44:17.36 --> 00:44:22.000
smaller donations. And that's kind of important too. You want to get all those donations as well.

459
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.08
Oh, so right now you're going after the big hitters kind of. Yeah. You're kind of go like these

460
00:44:26.08 --> 00:44:30.64
calls. There are people that have donated, you know, a thousand dollars in the past five thousand.

461
00:44:30.64 --> 00:44:35.52
And that kind of thing. So those kind of people, usually wouldn't. It's so weird to weigh these

462
00:44:35.52 --> 00:44:41.76
mechanisms work. Oh yeah. In the world. Like this is, you set up a system and you have no idea.

463
00:44:41.76 --> 00:44:45.92
Like, you know, you said earlier, you make laws, but you don't actually know what they're

464
00:44:45.92 --> 00:44:50.24
going to do when they hit the books and when they start getting an act in the world. This is one of

465
00:44:50.24 --> 00:44:56.72
those things. Like whoever made these laws, probably, or these rules, or when these rules were made,

466
00:44:56.72 --> 00:45:03.76
people have no idea how it was going to turn out. What it actually, what that actually translates

467
00:45:03.76 --> 00:45:09.04
to in the real world. Yeah. And one of my favorite examples of that is going through Officer Canada

468
00:45:09.04 --> 00:45:15.12
School in Officer Canada School. There was things that you did at Officer Canada School that had no,

469
00:45:15.12 --> 00:45:22.88
there's no possible way that the intention of the drill instructors was to have you doing what

470
00:45:22.88 --> 00:45:29.60
you're doing. One of the examples is you get a belt buckle. You get a belt buckle that has a

471
00:45:29.60 --> 00:45:34.08
coating on it. It's like a shiny brass belt buckle, but it's got a coating on this shiny brass

472
00:45:34.08 --> 00:45:38.80
belt buckle that because, you know, brass turns green or whatever. Yeah. Quick. Well, you get this one

473
00:45:38.80 --> 00:45:44.48
that's been treated in such a way that it never will get, it just stays shiny all the time. I mean,

474
00:45:44.48 --> 00:45:48.32
you can get thumb prints on it. If you stick your finger, although your thumb, but you can easily wipe it off.

475
00:45:48.96 --> 00:45:54.32
Well, what you do is you have to clean these belt buckles with brass so,

476
00:45:55.44 --> 00:46:01.68
until that lining comes off completely. And then you end up with a thing that you have to constantly

477
00:46:01.68 --> 00:46:06.72
polish all the time and it doesn't hold its shine. And you think yourself, at some point, someone said,

478
00:46:06.72 --> 00:46:10.72
hey, make sure there's no fingerprints on your brass belt buckle. And so people started cleaning it,

479
00:46:10.72 --> 00:46:15.76
and then they started cleaning it until the actual finish was off. And now this thing has become,

480
00:46:16.64 --> 00:46:24.08
become a totally different game. The game is no longer just keep your belt buckle clean. It's

481
00:46:24.08 --> 00:46:32.16
go completely psycho with with with brass. So until the thing is, it's not even functionally more.

482
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:35.36
When you get done with oxygenated, it's going to throw that thing away because it has no purpose.

483
00:46:35.36 --> 00:46:40.24
Yeah. They didn't mean it that way. At some point, somewhere along the way, a journalist

484
00:46:40.24 --> 00:46:44.56
struck her said, hey, you're going to film print. Make sure there's no fingerprints on your belt buckle.

485
00:46:44.56 --> 00:46:52.64
And that went from that over, however, me 30, 50 years to you polish all the finish completely off that

486
00:46:52.64 --> 00:46:57.20
thing until it's just pure brass. You get all these weird things that happen like that. And that's what

487
00:46:57.20 --> 00:47:02.88
this is. You know, it's this environment that's created. And all of a sudden, you've got these

488
00:47:02.88 --> 00:47:08.48
potential candidates or candidates that are running that are jumping through these random hoops

489
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:14.08
that have been built by random laws that were that seem to make sense to somebody at some time.

490
00:47:14.08 --> 00:47:18.56
Yeah. Well, they're not entirely random, but they have, they have, you know,

491
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:24.88
purposes and theories behind them. They want to prevent corruption. They want, they want,

492
00:47:24.88 --> 00:47:30.000
you know, politicians to be bought off or anything like that. But then you're never going to think

493
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.76
of absolutely every single contingency that could possibly happen. And then so you have the,

494
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:39.68
you know, these are the rules. And then, you know, human beings, these big old brains

495
00:47:40.32 --> 00:47:44.96
that we can adapt to when people figure out, you know, ways to maneuver and, you know,

496
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:48.64
this is what you get. And then so you're like, okay, we can't do this in this. And I will

497
00:47:48.64 --> 00:47:53.84
they just do a different way. So you can, you know, you, you create a best system you can. And then

498
00:47:53.84 --> 00:48:01.28
you just have to let people, you know, you, obviously always try and improve upon it. But you

499
00:48:01.28 --> 00:48:07.20
just have to live within that system. Do you guys do like an analytics to see,

500
00:48:07.20 --> 00:48:11.84
hey, how much are we getting from the calling center? I just feel like door to door,

501
00:48:11.84 --> 00:48:16.64
cold calling, like, is just as time goes on. It's like less and less and less of a thing. Yeah.

502
00:48:16.64 --> 00:48:23.92
Um, well, yeah. So we keep track. So like everybody that I call, I put in a spreadsheet.

503
00:48:23.92 --> 00:48:28.32
And I talk, you know, I put in there the result of call, what number I call, you know,

504
00:48:28.32 --> 00:48:34.80
what day I call them. So I can kind of look back. And then, yeah, so we kind of know.

505
00:48:34.80 --> 00:48:42.40
And so we can kind of analyze that. But kind of as you, as time goes on, a lot of the times

506
00:48:42.40 --> 00:48:46.48
it'll get easier to raise money because people see that you're raising money in success,

507
00:48:46.48 --> 00:48:52.000
green success. So they'll check and say, oh, this guy's already raised $200,000 or whatever. Maybe.

508
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.76
And then, okay, so he's a viable candidate now. So I'm actually going to donate him.

509
00:48:55.76 --> 00:48:59.12
And another reason that's kind of hard right now is because we have, you know,

510
00:48:59.12 --> 00:49:02.56
there's going to be a primary and a lot of people don't want to support in a primary because

511
00:49:02.56 --> 00:49:07.44
these people have money. They want to invest in something that they think is going to,

512
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:11.52
you know, be fruitful. So then there's no way to know. And so that's why you kind of have to get your

513
00:49:11.52 --> 00:49:15.60
story out there. You have to kind of convince them, you know, why you're a viable candidate and why

514
00:49:15.60 --> 00:49:21.36
they should support you. And it's not the most pleasant thing to have to do. And it's not the easiest

515
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:25.92
thing to do. But the more you do it, the more I'm kind of getting used to it now. And I'd rather

516
00:49:25.92 --> 00:49:32.48
ask a stranger for money than, you know, ask a close friend for money for sure. So then what's

517
00:49:32.48 --> 00:49:38.24
it? Okay. So we get, we get through this first quarter ends in September. Then what, what's

518
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:42.32
what, what does the campaign go from there? Do you have any idea, or are you just kind of like

519
00:49:42.32 --> 00:49:48.88
on board for the ride? I have no idea of where it's going to go. But yeah, I'm not an expert as my first

520
00:49:48.88 --> 00:49:56.32
time. So at the same time as you're raising money in these early stages, you are getting, just

521
00:49:56.32 --> 00:50:02.08
getting out and talking to people, going to events. And it's like I've been going to a

522
00:50:02.08 --> 00:50:06.24
Republican committee meetings and introducing myself. Like a lot of the times all out candidates

523
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:10.56
to come up in the beginning and speak for a few minutes and just so that they know, you know,

524
00:50:10.56 --> 00:50:15.04
I introduce myself. And then so you kind of building that network of people that know who you are

525
00:50:15.04 --> 00:50:19.84
and you're creating a little bit of buzz and you're meeting people. And I go out and I talk

526
00:50:19.84 --> 00:50:24.64
to board a supervisors on counties. And I just kind of taught in mayors and that kind of thing.

527
00:50:24.64 --> 00:50:28.40
And I just say, I just sit down and then what are the, you know, what are the issues that people

528
00:50:28.40 --> 00:50:31.84
are talking about here? And Northern Virginia is always traffic. There's like number one.

529
00:50:31.84 --> 00:50:36.80
And so I just say, what are people talking about tonight? It's kind of getting details on that.

530
00:50:36.80 --> 00:50:41.28
Because these people kind of know, you know, they know the people on a granular level because

531
00:50:41.28 --> 00:50:45.20
they're local representatives. So they can kind of tell me. And then you kind of look at that.

532
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:50.24
And then you can kind of see, okay, most of the people are talking about this and this and this.

533
00:50:50.24 --> 00:50:54.80
And so you kind of get a feel for that. And then at the same time as you're doing that, you're doing a lot of

534
00:50:54.80 --> 00:51:01.12
you know, research on policy. So you got to read up on, you know, all these different

535
00:51:01.84 --> 00:51:05.04
issues that you're finding out that people care about. You got to figure out, you know,

536
00:51:06.24 --> 00:51:09.36
what they are, what you can do to change them, what you can do to improve them,

537
00:51:09.36 --> 00:51:12.40
and that kind of things. So you kind of doing all these things simultaneously.

538
00:51:13.36 --> 00:51:18.32
And you just kind of go on that trajectory. Raise money, meet people, learn policies.

539
00:51:18.32 --> 00:51:26.16
When's the primary for you? Uh, so Virginia is kind of unique in that they every year.

540
00:51:26.16 --> 00:51:30.80
They kind of decide how they're going to select candidates. They're a public

541
00:51:30.80 --> 00:51:35.28
party. It is how they're going to select their candidates. So they just recently decided that

542
00:51:35.28 --> 00:51:39.44
they're not going to do a primary. What they're going to do is call a convention. And so they're

543
00:51:39.44 --> 00:51:44.40
going to have this convention in the 10th district. Uh, sometime next year, they haven't said

544
00:51:44.40 --> 00:51:50.64
a date for you. I don't probably be spring time spring, maybe early so. Yeah, probably late spring.

545
00:51:50.64 --> 00:51:58.000
And what they'll do is they'll bring in all these delegates from all over the counties. The

546
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.16
county is sent a certain number of delegates in. And what they'll do is all the candidates that want to

547
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:10.08
try and be the, uh, the Republican candidate. They'll get up and they'll speak in front of the delegation.

548
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:16.72
And then the delegates will go vote. And then if they don't have over 50%. If one person doesn't

549
00:52:16.72 --> 00:52:21.20
have over 50%. They'll knock off the bottom one or the bottom two and they'll vote again.

550
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:24.56
And they'll keep doing that. Keep doing that. Keep doing that. And then at the end, they'll

551
00:52:24.56 --> 00:52:30.80
send white smoke out of the, the top of the building. Uh, no. But they'll have, so

552
00:52:31.44 --> 00:52:35.28
eventually we'll be one person versus one person, so I'll get the majority. And then that's the

553
00:52:35.28 --> 00:52:39.92
person. That's it right there. And how many other people are going in the 10th district?

554
00:52:39.92 --> 00:52:44.000
Against, do you know right now there's one, uh, one other guy, army veteran.

555
00:52:45.52 --> 00:52:48.96
But there's always rumors. I mean, there's always other people that, you know, come in.

556
00:52:48.96 --> 00:52:53.28
And so there's rumors about other people that are thinking about coming in. But until they file,

557
00:52:53.28 --> 00:53:00.48
you don't know. It's just a conjecture. So you know that this just got recently to decide it on the fifth.

558
00:53:00.48 --> 00:53:06.96
So now that we have that kind of a situation, that's good in bad for us. Um, you know, unlike

559
00:53:06.96 --> 00:53:11.68
misogy I have no preference. I'll just do whatever the system is. That's what it is.

560
00:53:11.68 --> 00:53:19.36
Okay, cool. We're going to adapt to that. But uh, it's good for us because it requires less money.

561
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.68
So you don't have to go out there and do commercials for the primary and that kind of stuff.

562
00:53:23.68 --> 00:53:27.44
You don't have to do a lot of advertising. You can save all your money for the general election.

563
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:31.92
And when you're running against an incumbent, they already have millions and millions and millions

564
00:53:31.92 --> 00:53:37.44
of dollars. So you're going to be coming from a from a deficit compared to them. So that's good.

565
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:42.72
I can kind of save a little bit of money. Uh, but it's also a little bit more difficult because

566
00:53:42.72 --> 00:53:47.20
now you have to go out and you have to kind of, you have to find out who the delegates are.

567
00:53:47.76 --> 00:53:52.08
And they make a list of it. But you have to kind of talk to these delegates. And you have to convince

568
00:53:52.08 --> 00:53:57.36
them why you're the, you know, the best person. If you don't have make a good impression on this one

569
00:53:57.36 --> 00:54:01.52
person, well, they might not, you know, that's a vote loss. And so there's only so many delegates

570
00:54:01.52 --> 00:54:07.20
that you can talk to. So yeah, it's kind of pros and cons with it. But that's what we're doing.

571
00:54:07.20 --> 00:54:10.48
And so that's what I'm adapting to. And that's what we're going to, so we're going to make happen.

572
00:54:11.44 --> 00:54:14.32
And that's not even, we don't even know when that's going to happen right now.

573
00:54:14.88 --> 00:54:21.04
It'll be 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20. Yeah. Do you get, will you be making a

574
00:54:21.04 --> 00:54:25.60
speech at that thing straight up? Yeah, I mean, I think so. That's what I've been told anyway.

575
00:54:25.60 --> 00:54:30.88
I guess they, they have to come up with all the rules and everything of how it's going to work.

576
00:54:31.84 --> 00:54:35.28
Well, I guess they have rules in place, but they have to like release them. So you know,

577
00:54:35.28 --> 00:54:39.52
I'm sure there's, you know, you have to file as a candidate and all this stuff, you know,

578
00:54:39.52 --> 00:54:45.28
at the convention. But I think what the, what the guy told me that I talk to said is that they're

579
00:54:45.28 --> 00:54:49.76
going to do it where each person gets up and gives a stump speech before they start voting.

580
00:54:49.76 --> 00:54:56.16
But a lot of the work is going to be done before ideally you will have all your votes

581
00:54:57.04 --> 00:55:01.28
before you even ever give that speech. You're going to do the legwork. It's kind of like,

582
00:55:01.28 --> 00:55:04.88
you know, this is actually something that Pam says. And she's a, you know, four-time

583
00:55:04.88 --> 00:55:08.24
role champion, due to unparalleled big champion. So I should probably listen to what she says about

584
00:55:09.36 --> 00:55:17.84
competing. She says the race is one not on the day, but in the months and years that you spent

585
00:55:17.84 --> 00:55:22.64
training beforehand. So you got to put in the legwork, talk to these delegates, and you can even

586
00:55:23.36 --> 00:55:30.32
convince friends of yours to go try and be delegates. I see, you kind of, you know, get a team together

587
00:55:30.32 --> 00:55:34.88
like, yeah, get a team together to go there and try and become delegates. And said,

588
00:55:34.88 --> 00:55:40.16
they're your friends. So the vote for you. So you have to kind of do that legwork in order to hopefully win

589
00:55:41.12 --> 00:55:43.92
the vote before you even give your stump speech.

590
00:55:43.92 --> 00:55:51.36
This is one of the things I was thinking about as, you know, when we start talking about politics

591
00:55:51.36 --> 00:55:58.32
and in your case in particular, one of the things that comes up all the time in politics is gun control

592
00:55:58.32 --> 00:56:04.56
and all those issues. One of the things I was thinking about is you're, you went to Virginia Tech

593
00:56:05.52 --> 00:56:12.48
April 16th, 2007, newest 32 people killed in a mass shooting there. Were you on campus when

594
00:56:12.48 --> 00:56:18.000
that happened? No, I was a, was in my apartment. Oh, you were. Yeah, I was by Mr. My soon, you

595
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.88
seen your year. So I was there, ish, but I was in an apartment off campus. I just lived there.

596
00:56:23.92 --> 00:56:29.60
And when we got the first reports, it was kind of like, they were just saying that somebody

597
00:56:30.80 --> 00:56:37.60
was roaming around campus, you know, shooting people. So maybe it just, you know, graduated from boot camp

598
00:56:37.60 --> 00:56:43.44
not too long before. So I like a medial. I would go over there. So I, you know, I walked over to campus

599
00:56:43.44 --> 00:56:48.24
to see if I, without any kind of protection or anything to see if I could find this guy or whatever,

600
00:56:48.64 --> 00:56:52.72
walked around a little bit, but you know, I didn't see anybody because, you know, it was all happening

601
00:56:52.72 --> 00:56:55.68
in the building and it was all over by the time, I even left my apartment.

602
00:56:57.20 --> 00:57:03.36
And yeah, so I wasn't, you know, I wasn't there there. You know, I wasn't nowhere near the, the shooting,

603
00:57:03.36 --> 00:57:08.64
but I was there for the, you know, the aftermath and the, you know, just the pain that we felt as a community

604
00:57:09.52 --> 00:57:16.96
after the fact. What was the, what was the atmosphere afterwards? I mean, what they do with the

605
00:57:16.96 --> 00:57:23.44
students at school that you guys, what do you do with a, you know, a test you have on on Wednesday,

606
00:57:23.44 --> 00:57:28.16
what they just like the basic life stuff. Yeah, it is, it's just disbelief, you know, you can't believe

607
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:35.52
that it happened at all. And you can't believe that it happened to you, you know, to your community.

608
00:57:36.96 --> 00:57:44.24
And yeah, it's just one of those, I think they, you know, they, they just have to give you time,

609
00:57:44.24 --> 00:57:48.000
they give you, they give you, you know, gave everybody the week off. They're at the school. I think

610
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.92
that a really good job of supporting the students in my opinion, you know, they said no pressure.

611
00:57:53.92 --> 00:58:00.24
So they actually came out and said, if you want to, you don't have to finish the semester, if you

612
00:58:00.24 --> 00:58:05.76
don't want to. You can just cut your grades here and your teacher or your professor will, you know,

613
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:10.72
have a grade for you based on what you've done to this point. And you don't have to, you don't have to finish

614
00:58:10.72 --> 00:58:16.96
the year if you don't want to. And so they gave them that option. They had, you know, support available to,

615
00:58:16.96 --> 00:58:21.76
to anybody that was, you know, was struggling with, with dealing with the situation. They made that

616
00:58:21.76 --> 00:58:26.96
available, you know, memorials. It's like, there's not a whole lot, you can't deal with the thing

617
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:32.96
that everybody wants you to do is go back in time and have somebody tackle that guy, you know,

618
00:58:32.96 --> 00:58:39.44
before he ever did anything. You know, not to make it about me, but the way I felt about, I felt,

619
00:58:39.44 --> 00:58:43.92
I felt guilty that I wasn't in the building. You know, that's how I kind of felt about it. Like,

620
00:58:43.92 --> 00:58:50.40
maybe I could have been in one of those rooms and ran out the guy and, I don't know, given,

621
00:58:50.40 --> 00:58:55.52
people some time, you know, like a lot of people did. There was one professor that was a Holocaust

622
00:58:55.52 --> 00:59:00.88
survivor, slammed the door, blocked it. And I think he had his students crawl out the window or something.

623
00:59:00.88 --> 00:59:06.80
And he gets, you know, he got killed by the, by the shooter. And so that's kind of how I felt at the

624
00:59:06.80 --> 00:59:11.84
time about it. I wish I had been there to maybe do something. But it's mostly just, you just,

625
00:59:13.04 --> 00:59:15.60
you know, you just can't believe it. It's kind of indescribable.

626
00:59:15.60 --> 00:59:22.16
It's an interesting idea of giving, when you first said, oh, they gave people the option of,

627
00:59:22.72 --> 00:59:26.56
of just taking their grade right there, whatever it happened to be at that time and then you

628
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:29.68
don't, I don't have to finish this semester. And at first I thought to myself, yeah, that's a really

629
00:59:29.68 --> 00:59:32.80
good idea. And then as I thought about it, sitting here as you were talking,

630
00:59:34.40 --> 00:59:39.36
what that does, what that could do to people is, okay, now what are you going to do? So now what

631
00:59:39.36 --> 00:59:46.96
do you do? You sit there and you start to dwell on this and that seems to me like a good idea that

632
00:59:46.96 --> 00:59:52.32
in practice, the best thing to, not the best thing to do. But well, I think it's the best thing to do

633
00:59:53.28 --> 00:59:58.56
is okay, we're going to, we're going to get a week off, right? Maybe we're going to get two weeks off.

634
00:59:58.56 --> 01:00:02.56
But we're going to get a week off. We're going to hold ceremonies. We're going to mourn. And then

635
01:00:02.56 --> 01:00:11.04
we're going to get back to work and we're going to carry on. And because otherwise you're stuck

636
01:00:11.68 --> 01:00:18.72
with just the thoughts of the loss that you suffered. And it's one of those weird things.

637
01:00:20.72 --> 01:00:27.28
When you say that you, that you need to move on, right? It sounds like the coldest,

638
01:00:27.28 --> 01:00:34.40
most horrible thing that a person could say if you, if someone loses a loved one and you look

639
01:00:34.40 --> 01:00:39.84
at him and you say, well, you know, you've got to move on, right? And that's like, that seems

640
01:00:39.84 --> 01:00:44.24
like the most horrible and cold thing to say. Yeah. Hey, you've lost the love for them, but guess

641
01:00:44.24 --> 01:00:53.28
what, you got to move on. That sounds so horrible. But it's kind of what you need to do, right? I mean,

642
01:00:53.28 --> 01:00:58.88
you, it's what you need to do. Your, your love one that you've lost, they don't want you to sit

643
01:00:58.88 --> 01:01:04.32
around in mourn for seven months while you wait for the semester to end for summer to end. And then

644
01:01:04.32 --> 01:01:09.68
you go, what are you going to do during that time period? Yeah. And so that's a rough thing to think about.

645
01:01:10.56 --> 01:01:18.48
But I think it's, it's definitely one of those hard things that you have, the hard conversation

646
01:01:18.48 --> 01:01:21.20
that you have to have and sometimes you have to have that conversation with yourself

647
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:25.76
is when you say to yourself or you say to someone else, you've got to move on.

648
01:01:27.36 --> 01:01:35.84
And it seems so cold and heartless, but at the same time, it's what you actually do have to do.

649
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:40.32
Yeah. And yeah, I never actually thought about it from that perspective in terms of, you know,

650
01:01:40.32 --> 01:01:45.36
them allowing people to, to, you know, cut the semester short. But, you know, that's a really

651
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:49.36
good point. You have to have something to do. Otherwise, you're just going to sit around and

652
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:54.96
just think about it all day, all the time. But at the same time, you know, they didn't want people's

653
01:01:54.96 --> 01:01:58.96
grades to be affected by, be negatively affected by, you know, for sure. Yeah, for sure.

654
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:02.08
For sure. I don't know. It's kind of see where they're coming from for sure.

655
01:02:02.08 --> 01:02:07.76
Tough decision to make, tough decision to make. Yeah, I don't know.

656
01:02:07.76 --> 01:02:14.80
You know, another thing that that's that I've definitely thought about since you, you know, entered

657
01:02:14.80 --> 01:02:21.44
into this arena is thinking about a thing about Lewis Polar Jr. Right? Yeah. Run in for

658
01:02:22.64 --> 01:02:28.32
running for the House of Representatives in the first district of Virginia. He ran as a Democrat.

659
01:02:29.44 --> 01:02:39.12
He, as we know, lost the election and he lost it to basically a Republican kind of warhawk. Yeah.

660
01:02:39.12 --> 01:02:47.68
That had the draft deferment multiple times. So it didn't go to Vietnam, but was kind of, you know,

661
01:02:49.04 --> 01:02:55.28
a warhawk type guy. Yeah. And one thing that's really interesting when you read

662
01:02:57.04 --> 01:03:04.40
fortunate son is that there was all these opportunities that Lewis Polar Jr. had to kind of start

663
01:03:04.40 --> 01:03:12.56
negative campaigning against his opponent and he didn't do it. And he ran that campaign with his

664
01:03:12.56 --> 01:03:19.92
much dignity and class as you as a as a person could run. Yeah. And any loss, any loss by a

665
01:03:19.92 --> 01:03:25.28
big big margin, too. I think he lost by like 25% which is crazy to think about.

666
01:03:28.16 --> 01:03:33.12
Are you thinking about right now? What it looks like where where your own

667
01:03:33.12 --> 01:03:40.16
personal line of, hey, this is too far and I'm not going to go there. You have to, yeah, you

668
01:03:40.16 --> 01:03:45.36
have to maintain your more compass and you want, I want to win, but I want to win in the way

669
01:03:46.48 --> 01:03:52.40
that I set out to win. I don't want to win by being somebody that I'm not. I want to win by being

670
01:03:52.40 --> 01:03:59.92
the person that I am and then if people want that person to represent them in Congress, then I'd

671
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:06.40
be honored to do that. But if the person I am, the people decide that they don't want that in Congress,

672
01:04:06.40 --> 01:04:11.92
you know, fair enough. I understand no hard feelings. I still love this area. I still love the

673
01:04:11.92 --> 01:04:16.16
district. This is where you get into a little slippery slope possibility. Yeah. Okay.

674
01:04:16.16 --> 01:04:23.12
Because here's the question you can ask yourself is listen, I'm Rob Jones. I know I want to do

675
01:04:23.12 --> 01:04:29.04
the right thing for the right reasons in order for me to have that possibility. I'm going to have to

676
01:04:29.04 --> 01:04:34.40
have to get a little bit medieval on some people here, right? Yeah. And you think, okay, as soon

677
01:04:34.40 --> 01:04:39.60
as this is over, though, I'll go right back to, you know, being on the moral high ground.

678
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:47.04
But if I stay on the moral high ground this whole time, I might not even get there. So I need

679
01:04:47.04 --> 01:04:51.60
to position my, like there's a slippery slope there. What do you say? No, what I got to make, I got

680
01:04:51.60 --> 01:04:56.48
to run this negative at. I got to do this, I got to make this statement about my opponent, right?

681
01:04:56.48 --> 01:05:03.92
That stuff or, or I'm not going to get the publicity that I need to win. That's a slippery,

682
01:05:04.80 --> 01:05:09.84
that's a slippery slope. Yeah. Well, that's, yeah, that's the, the gray area that a lot of

683
01:05:09.84 --> 01:05:15.28
elections are are one in Austin. And, you know, maybe we should write a book after this called the

684
01:05:15.28 --> 01:05:23.92
decademy of politics, you know, and it's just, yeah, you have your, you know, kind of so-called default

685
01:05:23.92 --> 01:05:29.60
aggressive type of opinion or position on that default, you know, good guy or whatever, maybe.

686
01:05:30.64 --> 01:05:37.28
But then yet you have some some gray areas there where, yeah, if the elections go on bad and you

687
01:05:37.28 --> 01:05:41.28
feel like this person is really going to be bad for the country and for the district, then you might

688
01:05:41.28 --> 01:05:47.04
have to do something that you wouldn't normally do. But you kind of maintain that moral compass

689
01:05:47.76 --> 01:05:52.72
even with that. So you take it to a certain level and then you dial it back and you don't do it again

690
01:05:52.72 --> 01:05:58.48
and you don't let it kind of slip away and you can keep doing it. So you kind of have to take

691
01:05:59.44 --> 01:06:04.40
every situation as it's your own unique situation and kind of step out and then step back,

692
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:12.72
step out and step back as needed, I guess. I think that in the end with situations like that,

693
01:06:12.72 --> 01:06:17.92
what it, what you have to maintain above all is you have to maintain the truth. And if you

694
01:06:17.92 --> 01:06:23.76
maintain the truth about what's happening, I think in the in the in the long run and oftentimes

695
01:06:23.76 --> 01:06:29.76
in the short run, hey, if you're telling the truth about what's going on, that's what that's what

696
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:35.36
make you win. Yeah, very true. Yeah, you can kind of go negative. You can say something that's bad about

697
01:06:35.36 --> 01:06:42.48
the other person. But you can just say, oh, well, this negative at is this person voted for this bill

698
01:06:42.48 --> 01:06:46.88
that did this and that's kind of going negative, but it's not you're not, you're not, you're not

699
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:51.12
just something that adds a person. And you're telling the truth. Yeah, not making something. That's a good,

700
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:56.32
that's a good way to approach it. I'll let you know how it goes when I start having to make

701
01:06:56.32 --> 01:07:00.72
those types of decisions. Hopefully it's so obvious that I'm going to win that I won't even have

702
01:07:00.72 --> 01:07:06.24
to make those decisions. But what's it? You know, and that's the other weird thing about politics is

703
01:07:06.24 --> 01:07:16.000
you know, I used to think of the officers that were in the military and most of the time,

704
01:07:16.96 --> 01:07:22.24
much of the time, the officers that you wanted to work for were the kind of officers that

705
01:07:23.20 --> 01:07:29.68
didn't really care as not the right word, but I'm not sure how to explain it. Didn't really,

706
01:07:29.68 --> 01:07:35.28
they weren't all jazzed up because they were an officer. They were jazzed up to work with the

707
01:07:35.28 --> 01:07:41.60
troops. They were jazzed up to serve the country. They weren't doing it for their own career. Right?

708
01:07:41.60 --> 01:07:46.32
And it's the same thing with politics. If you think about the type of people that you would actually

709
01:07:46.32 --> 01:07:52.88
want to have in political power, one of the main reasons why you would want them in that position

710
01:07:52.88 --> 01:07:57.20
is because they would never want to be there. They're the type of people that say, well,

711
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.72
there are people like you that say, hey, listen, this is not what I want to do, but this is kind

712
01:08:02.72 --> 01:08:08.48
of what I have to do. This is the void of leadership and and someone needs to fill that void. So there's

713
01:08:08.48 --> 01:08:16.32
another kind of dichotomy there that the person that you would actually want in that position is

714
01:08:16.32 --> 01:08:20.48
the person that fundamentally in their own heart doesn't really want that position. Yeah.

715
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:28.64
And you end up with and it's sort of like in in man search for meaning, the book about the concentration

716
01:08:28.64 --> 01:08:36.24
camps and he says that the best of us didn't make it. The best of us didn't survive because the

717
01:08:36.24 --> 01:08:43.52
best people in the concentration camp, the purist and most good people were the people that said,

718
01:08:43.52 --> 01:08:51.20
hey, you take this crust bread instead of me, hey, you take all step up and do this labor that's

719
01:08:51.20 --> 01:08:56.40
going to push you over the edge and make you sick. I'll give you my blanket at night because we only

720
01:08:56.40 --> 01:09:02.88
have one for for for us and you're the one that needs it the most. Those good people they didn't

721
01:09:02.88 --> 01:09:10.000
survive and that's kind of it's kind of what happens in politics or it could very well. It happens

722
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.80
in many cases in politics where the person that won't cross that line, the person that doesn't just

723
01:09:16.80 --> 01:09:24.48
look out for themselves first, that's the person that doesn't win because they didn't go negative,

724
01:09:24.48 --> 01:09:33.44
they didn't mud sling, they didn't undermine and they end up not winning. So this is a tough situation,

725
01:09:33.44 --> 01:09:38.88
but I think what's good is I think there's more opportunity now and I think there's a lot of things

726
01:09:38.88 --> 01:09:43.68
out there that level the playing field and I think one of them is social media, right? This podcast,

727
01:09:43.68 --> 01:09:48.40
okay, you're on here, you get to tell, you get to talk about people know your story, they hear it

728
01:09:48.40 --> 01:09:55.52
on a broad basis, you know, you got your own social media that you can talk directly to people and

729
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.32
there's no filter, doesn't cost any money to put up a social media post. Now does it cost money to

730
01:10:00.32 --> 01:10:05.76
advertise a social media post? Yes, it does. It does. So if somebody can dump more money into that,

731
01:10:05.76 --> 01:10:11.84
but at least the playing field is more level than it used to be for you to get your voice out there

732
01:10:11.84 --> 01:10:20.88
and not have to do slimy, shady things to do it. Yeah, and then yeah with respect to what you're

733
01:10:20.88 --> 01:10:26.96
saying about, you know, some people didn't survive. You also have to wonder whether or not a lot of the

734
01:10:26.96 --> 01:10:34.24
times are some of the times surviving isn't always the best thing. So if you have to do something

735
01:10:35.12 --> 01:10:41.60
to just to survive and it's something that's even worse than death, then sometimes you don't want

736
01:10:41.60 --> 01:10:46.48
to survive and sometimes you can be fine with that. And so it's kind of the same thing with political

737
01:10:46.48 --> 01:10:52.48
if I have to sling mud and do all that stuff, then maybe that's maybe that's not worth it.

738
01:10:52.48 --> 01:10:57.92
Yeah, I don't know. I totally agree. All right, you wrote a little something about leadership and

739
01:10:57.92 --> 01:11:04.16
it's I was going to kind of read some chunks of it here. There's a void of true leadership in Congress.

740
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:12.48
It is blatantly evident in all the modern forms of media, print, broadcast and social. It is

741
01:11:12.48 --> 01:11:17.28
patently obvious that the words and behaviors of many of our elected representatives at all levels

742
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:22.72
and in all political parties. One needn't look further than this void to identify the root of

743
01:11:22.72 --> 01:11:27.44
the rotten climate in politics that is sickening the American public.

744
01:11:27.44 --> 01:11:34.80
There's a big chunk of the American public that are sickened by that. There's a big chunk that

745
01:11:34.80 --> 01:11:42.80
actually just full on participates, too. Yeah, that's true. It's crazy. I'm not too

746
01:11:44.32 --> 01:11:50.80
I'm not an active participant in Facebook. I mean, I have Facebook and I post on Facebook,

747
01:11:50.80 --> 01:11:57.44
but I don't get involved much in the personal Facebook, right? Yeah.

748
01:11:58.64 --> 01:12:05.04
But I hear stories about Facebook from people that are on it. It's like a crazy battleground

749
01:12:05.76 --> 01:12:11.60
where people on the friend you, if you make a statement or you like someone's political post

750
01:12:11.60 --> 01:12:19.28
that they don't agree with, it's like crazy people. Crazy people. But I like to, you know, I believe

751
01:12:19.28 --> 01:12:26.000
that truly believe that those people are the minority, the vast minority. I agree with you. And I

752
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.76
said this, I said this on a podcast and every someone's like, well, there's all these extremists

753
01:12:31.76 --> 01:12:35.04
out there and I was like, you know what, I travel the country all the time. I work with businesses

754
01:12:35.04 --> 01:12:41.04
of all sizes. Oh, yeah, this is Ben Shapiro's podcast. I travel the country. I'm all over the place

755
01:12:41.04 --> 01:12:45.12
all the time. I work with all these companies. I work with frontline troops. I work with lead

756
01:12:45.12 --> 01:12:52.48
mid-level leaders. I work with CEOs. I work with everyone in the spectrum. And I don't meet people

757
01:12:54.24 --> 01:13:00.000
regularly that are like that. I don't know who those people are that are going crazy on Facebook.

758
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.32
I don't meet them. I know they're out there. But yes, you're right. And I agree with you.

759
01:13:04.72 --> 01:13:09.12
Most people, what are they trying to do with their life? Oh, they, they're trying to, or money,

760
01:13:09.12 --> 01:13:11.68
they're trying to raise their family. They're trying to spend time with their family. They're trying

761
01:13:11.68 --> 01:13:18.56
to pay off their house. That's what they're doing. So yes, I agree that I think I will kind of

762
01:13:18.56 --> 01:13:23.44
retract my statement a little bit and say in that you say it's sickening to the American public. I think

763
01:13:23.44 --> 01:13:28.56
most people in the American public are definitely sick of it. And that's what I said to Ben Shapiro.

764
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:38.56
I said, Ben, I mean, he is at, he is at what is it called? He's at Ground Zero for political fire.

765
01:13:38.56 --> 01:13:44.64
Yeah. And, and you know, I was on another guy named Brian Coppimman's podcast and he's like the

766
01:13:44.64 --> 01:13:48.80
other end of the spectrum. And actually we joked about the fact, you know, I was like, if you met Ben

767
01:13:48.80 --> 01:13:52.88
Shapiro, you'd like to find his a really nice guy. And Brian Coppim said, I'm not even that's cool

768
01:13:52.88 --> 01:13:58.000
to make sense, but they're they're completely opposite ends of the of the political spectrum.

769
01:13:58.72 --> 01:14:04.56
But I think that those people at the far, far ends and both of those guys can be a little bit of

770
01:14:04.56 --> 01:14:11.52
Ground Zero for, you know, impact and people go go crazy. Yeah. There's people that like to just

771
01:14:11.52 --> 01:14:16.72
stir things up, right? I mean, there's people that like to stir things up. Most people are like to

772
01:14:16.72 --> 01:14:21.76
stir things up in one way or another. Okay. Not necessarily politically, specifically, some people

773
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:27.76
politically, but in one way or another. Oh, yeah, it's fun. Not to do it, but to see it happen. So some

774
01:14:27.76 --> 01:14:33.28
people they like to take part, you know. All right, moving on with this, this piece you up, the legislative

775
01:14:33.28 --> 01:14:37.92
branch of the United States government is comprised of 535 legislators. Many of them have begun

776
01:14:37.92 --> 01:14:41.92
venturing down a path that can only be characterized as the opposite of true leadership.

777
01:14:42.64 --> 01:14:46.56
A path that displays a lack of respect for anyone with a different worldview from them.

778
01:14:47.36 --> 01:14:53.92
A path that involves dehumanizing and demonizing people simply because they're a member of an opposing

779
01:14:53.92 --> 01:15:00.48
party. Many of these legislators have stopped viewing people's individuals and have instead applied

780
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:10.56
a group identity and used it to apply group blame. Yeah. That's a Jordan Peterson line that I kind

781
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:16.16
of stole. I heard him say that one time I thought was a really good line. Well, the, the, that is a true

782
01:15:16.16 --> 01:15:22.40
statement. Yeah. And that was, I said many. I didn't say all or anything like that either because

783
01:15:23.84 --> 01:15:27.68
it's kind of what we were talking about just now. The, uh, maybe sometimes

784
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:33.20
you only think that the vast majority of people are doing it because they, you only hear about the

785
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:39.76
people that are, that are being, you know, kind of naughty or whatever. So, yeah. So it can be, it

786
01:15:39.76 --> 01:15:45.44
maybe it can be said that maybe it's the minority of legislators that are, you know, kind of,

787
01:15:45.44 --> 01:15:52.48
going under this kind of behavior. But I think it's, there's a trend, starting to have more and more

788
01:15:52.48 --> 01:15:58.56
and more, it's happening. Yeah. So you also get, you also get the mob mentality, just to straight

789
01:15:58.56 --> 01:16:04.80
up mob mentality where it's blood in the water and the sharks are going to go crazy. And who was it?

790
01:16:04.80 --> 01:16:12.40
It was, um, Dave Chappelle. I was, I saw little clip of Dave Chappelle's, um, new Netflix special

791
01:16:12.96 --> 01:16:20.48
and he's making this joke. He says he says, uh, guess who I am? And if you do something wrong,

792
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:26.40
every in your life and I find out about it. I don't care if it's in five years, 10 years, 15 years,

793
01:16:26.40 --> 01:16:32.000
20 years, if I find out about it, I'm going to ruin everything you have. And he says, guess who I am?

794
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.04
And people are yelling out different names and he goes, I'm you. Right. Yeah. That's what everyone

795
01:16:37.04 --> 01:16:42.000
does. That's what everyone does now does. So we get this mob mentality of, oh, you made a mistake.

796
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.56
Are you said something that was out of line or whatever the case may be? Cool. We're going to

797
01:16:46.56 --> 01:16:53.04
crucify you now. That's what's going to happen. And unfortunately, in Congress anyway, they're all

798
01:16:53.04 --> 01:16:57.92
kind of peers. They're all kind of equals. So there's no one leader that can kind of come in,

799
01:16:57.92 --> 01:17:05.52
like the Meal Eye Massacre and put a stop to things. Um, so yeah, there's no way that that can really

800
01:17:05.52 --> 01:17:09.44
step forward and do that. Yeah. As I kind of influence. Unless you just take the moral high

801
01:17:09.44 --> 01:17:14.000
round and people start to see that that's the correct example. Yeah. So you kind of have to start

802
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.28
leading. Yeah. Laterally. And I think like Dan Crunchy, I was doing a great job of that. He

803
01:17:19.28 --> 01:17:24.24
yeah, he is just response. He's not emotional. He just kind of, you know, states has a

804
01:17:24.24 --> 01:17:28.56
opinion, recognizing that there's other views tries to explain around it. Doesn't get personal with

805
01:17:28.56 --> 01:17:33.52
people. He's just doing a great job from that perspective. Yeah. Doesn't get fired up. No face.

806
01:17:33.52 --> 01:17:39.68
Does just keeps normal face all the time. He's not getting crazy. And you know, it's it's hard.

807
01:17:39.68 --> 01:17:46.000
I remember explaining this when we got home from Ramadi. You know, there was inside the

808
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.16
sealed community. There were some people that were looking at the operations we did and what we did

809
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:54.56
that thought, oh, why are you guys going out the daytime? Why are you guys supporting conventional

810
01:17:54.56 --> 01:17:59.52
operations? They're asking these questions. And basically, it's it's my fault that they were asking

811
01:17:59.52 --> 01:18:03.44
those questions because it means that I didn't do a good job of letting the community know

812
01:18:04.32 --> 01:18:09.20
why exactly we were in that position and what the strategic impact of those missions were

813
01:18:09.20 --> 01:18:15.68
and all those things. But I remember talking to life and Seth because I mean, coming home from

814
01:18:15.68 --> 01:18:21.52
Ramadi, you know, we suffered some significant casualties and to hear someone say, you know,

815
01:18:21.52 --> 01:18:25.92
what were you guys even doing? It's really easy to get emotional. And I sat those guys down. I'm

816
01:18:25.92 --> 01:18:33.28
like, listen, when you discuss this with people, if you get emotional, your your argument goes out

817
01:18:33.28 --> 01:18:37.52
the window because now you're just they're looking at you going, oh, he's super emotional. That's

818
01:18:37.52 --> 01:18:42.08
only he's he doesn't make any sense. We can't listen to what he's saying because he's emotional.

819
01:18:42.08 --> 01:18:47.20
Yeah. And so I said, when we when we talk about this with people, we have to just get

820
01:18:47.20 --> 01:18:51.68
unemotional just detached and just explain, hey, this is what we're doing here. It's what was going

821
01:18:51.68 --> 01:18:55.44
on. So what the conventional forces were doing, this is what the strategy was here's how we were

822
01:18:55.44 --> 01:19:00.40
able to help. You just have to do it like that because if you go, what are you talking? And another

823
01:19:00.40 --> 01:19:05.44
thing that's really easy to do is you already, but they're like getting really fired up and we can't

824
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:11.60
do that. So I think Dan is doing a good job of that. And hopefully that example will continue to

825
01:19:11.60 --> 01:19:18.000
spread. And I know you'll you'll be doing that as well. All right, moving down. The path leads to an end

826
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
point of limited to no effective communication. A lack of communication produces an environment in

827
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.96
which no meaningful work can get accomplished. A workless environment in Congress means that

828
01:19:28.96 --> 01:19:36.64
a miracle will stagnate. The process and systems on which our country runs will not be able to improve.

829
01:19:36.64 --> 01:19:44.56
The result is that Americans will suffer. Yeah, people can't even talk people can't even talk to

830
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:50.40
each other. Yeah. In Congress. Yeah, if you can't come either way. It's crazy. Like you can't,

831
01:19:51.52 --> 01:19:58.64
the the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the time is going to be close to

832
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:07.20
50% Democrat 50% Republican. And you rely on these other people to pass legislation and to do

833
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:14.000
the job of Congress, which is to pass bills that can improve America, improves the lives of Americans.

834
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.40
So if people can't communicate, so I could have, I could go into a committee or whatever with

835
01:20:20.40 --> 01:20:26.40
the cure for cancer. Like this bill will cure cancer guarantee. Even if it is, you know, what I said

836
01:20:26.40 --> 01:20:32.24
before where you don't know, I know for sure. This will cure cancer. But I go into committee that

837
01:20:32.24 --> 01:20:38.48
day of the week before, you know, representative Charles, I went on Twitter and I said,

838
01:20:39.28 --> 01:20:45.36
what an idiot. This guy's stupid. You know, I just did a tweet like that. He's got this to the

839
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:48.96
cancer. Not voting for it. All his friends aren't voting for it because they're on his team.

840
01:20:49.92 --> 01:20:54.24
So that cancer bill, even though it's going to cure cancer, it's going to be the best thing ever

841
01:20:54.24 --> 01:20:58.32
doesn't see the light a day. So it's like you might as well not even have it.

842
01:21:01.28 --> 01:21:06.64
Continuing on, but there is hope. Despite them getting next to no coverage in the media,

843
01:21:06.64 --> 01:21:10.48
there are true leaders in Congress. We can learn from their example. A true leader

844
01:21:10.48 --> 01:21:15.28
recognizes that every person comes for a unique set of experiences, including their

845
01:21:15.28 --> 01:21:19.76
upbringing, education struggles and environment that forms their worldview, including values,

846
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:25.92
priorities and perspectives. The leader also recognizes that even if an individual's an individual

847
01:21:25.92 --> 01:21:31.60
person's worldview is wholly opposite, then that of the leaders, it is nevertheless equally valid

848
01:21:31.60 --> 01:21:38.16
and worthy of consideration. The leader knows that the worldview and the person must be shown,

849
01:21:38.16 --> 01:21:42.88
respect. The leader gives the other person the benefit of believing that they have good intention

850
01:21:44.24 --> 01:21:49.36
and thoughtful and now and thoughtfully analyzes their ideas before coming to a conclusion as to their

851
01:21:49.36 --> 01:21:56.08
viability. I gave an answer. I think it was at the last master. So many asked this big crazy

852
01:21:56.08 --> 01:21:59.84
question about leadership. I will want to say something. What are you doing this about? And

853
01:22:00.88 --> 01:22:08.24
and I said, oh, we know you do it with that. And one of the most underutilized tools in all

854
01:22:08.24 --> 01:22:15.52
of leadership is to listen. Actually listen to what other people are saying. Actually listen to

855
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:18.88
the people below you in the chain of command. Listen to people above you in the chain of command. Listen

856
01:22:18.88 --> 01:22:23.60
to your, if you're in a family, listen to what your wife, listen to what you actually listen to what

857
01:22:23.60 --> 01:22:28.80
people have to say. And that's what you're saying right here. Instead of as soon as your mouth opens

858
01:22:28.80 --> 01:22:33.44
up, I already am judging what I think you're going to say and shutting it down, is that I actually

859
01:22:33.44 --> 01:22:39.52
listen? I always, when I'm listening to people, I always think, why, I don't, I don't, my, my first

860
01:22:39.52 --> 01:22:46.32
instinct when you start saying something isn't why are you wrong. My instinct is, hey, what is

861
01:22:46.32 --> 01:22:53.76
this person know that I might not know? What, what about this person's perspective? It's correct

862
01:22:53.76 --> 01:23:00.80
that that doesn't make sense to me or that I don't understand. Continue on a true leader of

863
01:23:00.80 --> 01:23:06.08
Congress recognizes that America relies on the teamwork of people with opposing viewpoints. The

864
01:23:06.08 --> 01:23:11.92
idea of a republic is not to have 51% of the people cram an idea around the, throw to 49% of

865
01:23:11.92 --> 01:23:16.72
the people. Nor is it the opposite. It is to find solutions that as many people as possible can be

866
01:23:16.72 --> 01:23:20.80
happy with when they go to bed at night. The leader knows that the only way to achieve this is

867
01:23:20.80 --> 01:23:26.56
do working together. And I think that's, you'd think that that was a common sense statement.

868
01:23:27.12 --> 01:23:31.44
Hey, somewhere there's a happy medium that will work for a majority of the people. Right?

869
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:36.48
It's not way over here. And it's not way over here. There's a little dichotomy between those

870
01:23:36.48 --> 01:23:40.88
two that you have to balance as a leader. Yeah, anymore it's like everybody on the other side

871
01:23:40.88 --> 01:23:46.88
is don't move at inch. Don't give up an inch. It's like this country was founded on something called

872
01:23:46.88 --> 01:23:52.56
the great compromise back in, you know, when they were right in the Constitution. Yeah, well, that

873
01:23:52.56 --> 01:23:58.16
idea of that every single thing is a slippery slope is something that's very hard to

874
01:23:58.16 --> 01:24:03.60
contend with. Yeah. Right. And I think the reason it's so hard to contend with is that

875
01:24:03.60 --> 01:24:10.40
folks on the extremes are so ravenous that when they do get an inch, they go cool. We got an inch.

876
01:24:10.40 --> 01:24:16.56
We need to take a foot. And we got a foot. Now we'll take a yard. And so both sides have that attitude.

877
01:24:16.56 --> 01:24:20.72
Yeah. Instead of someone coming to the table, putting the ego and check and saying, okay, you know what?

878
01:24:20.72 --> 01:24:30.64
But we trust that you'll do this. And you know, I think one of the things that makes America

879
01:24:30.64 --> 01:24:34.96
stable is that it's a tough, it's a big bureaucratic system that's hard to move. Right.

880
01:24:34.96 --> 01:24:40.72
It's a big bureaucratic system that's hard to move. No one person has a massive effect.

881
01:24:42.08 --> 01:24:47.28
They just don't. I mean, like you can steer some stuff. You can make some things happen. You can

882
01:24:47.28 --> 01:24:51.68
make some, you can put some laws into place, but those laws might get repealed. I mean, it's a hard

883
01:24:51.68 --> 01:24:59.84
place to move around. And if people understood how hard it is to move around, then maybe they can

884
01:24:59.84 --> 01:25:04.80
start looking at other viewpoints a little bit more, like, let's, let's actually move forward

885
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:12.72
in some direction. That teamwork relies in turn on communication between these people. The leader

886
01:25:12.72 --> 01:25:17.84
knows the leader knows how to effectively communicate with both people that agree with them and those

887
01:25:17.84 --> 01:25:23.52
that don't. They communicate directly with the person. They explain their side and genuinely attempt

888
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:29.36
to understand the other persons with humility, with respect, without insults. They don't sling mud

889
01:25:29.36 --> 01:25:35.92
in the public space effectively forever alienating that person on whom they rely for teamwork.

890
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:43.12
A true leader acts selflessly in the performance of their duties. They make the decisions and

891
01:25:43.12 --> 01:25:48.24
implement the actions that they've truthfully think are the best interests of the people that

892
01:25:48.24 --> 01:25:54.32
they represent and of America. They do so even if the result is damaging to their career.

893
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:00.64
They don't care about notoriety and are happy to happy in the simple knowledge that the people

894
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:07.28
that do know them believe in them wholeheartedly and they are making a difference. The good news

895
01:26:07.28 --> 01:26:11.36
is that we have leaders like this throughout our country, summary and congress, but if America

896
01:26:11.36 --> 01:26:22.000
is going to continue to be the greatest country on earth, Congress needs more. Pretty straightforward.

897
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.92
Yeah, I mean, we need people to step up and that's real. We talked about it before. That's why

898
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:36.72
I decided to do it. Somebody has to be the one to enter into the arena and it's better to have

899
01:26:36.72 --> 01:26:43.20
somebody that has this kind of attitude, I think, then allow somebody else to do it.

900
01:26:43.20 --> 01:26:52.56
And I think something else, people with this attitude are going to be able to need to prevail

901
01:26:52.56 --> 01:27:00.80
and we need to move away from the extremist viewpoints that come out even in Congress.

902
01:27:00.80 --> 01:27:10.80
Because it's a tough question when you say that you look at the other people as if their intentions

903
01:27:10.80 --> 01:27:18.24
are good. You look into someone else and go, hey, look, what they want is what's best for America.

904
01:27:18.24 --> 01:27:23.44
And that's a very pure way to look at it. I will tell you that I've talked to some smart people

905
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:31.20
that look at some people in politics and say they have and I've discussed this on a podcast.

906
01:27:31.20 --> 01:27:36.96
I'm trying to think of with who, but there's people that think, no, they don't actually want

907
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:45.20
the best for America or their vision of America is different and outside what

908
01:27:45.20 --> 01:27:52.16
what the Constitution says. So that's another thing to think about.

909
01:27:53.20 --> 01:28:00.72
And I think that this attitude of people going into Congress that will actually listen,

910
01:28:01.60 --> 01:28:05.52
well, this is what I think will happen. The people that will go into Congress that actually

911
01:28:05.52 --> 01:28:13.04
listen, that actually can have meaningful conversations. I think that, or my hope is that that attitude

912
01:28:13.04 --> 01:28:21.04
will begin to rise to the surface that people realize that what you want, you know, the very first podcast

913
01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:26.96
I interviewed I ever did was with Tim Ferriss and he asked something about leadership and I talked

914
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:32.64
about humility and then I talked about being balanced. And I think what people, hopefully in America,

915
01:28:32.64 --> 01:28:39.12
we'll start to realize is that what we want is not, are not people on the extremes, but people

916
01:28:39.12 --> 01:28:46.08
that are balanced and can communicate and listen, which is what you are bringing to the table.

917
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:52.08
Yeah, and the reason that a lot of the times people get elected that have these kind of extreme

918
01:28:52.08 --> 01:28:56.000
views is because it gets coverage, it gets their name out there, people find out who they are

919
01:28:56.56 --> 01:29:00.64
and what they're saying kind of scares the person and the person is kind of reacting and, you know,

920
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:06.96
from that fear. And so I think, you know, that I have a little bit of an advantage here where

921
01:29:06.96 --> 01:29:13.44
I can be kind of with this attitude and I can still get coverage because, you know,

922
01:29:13.44 --> 01:29:17.36
I am a wounded veteran and I've done so much service and I've done all these things that I've done.

923
01:29:17.36 --> 01:29:23.12
So people are more likely to want to, you know, tell my story because, you know, it's a

924
01:29:23.92 --> 01:29:28.96
relatively compelling story. It's a very compelling story. I was talking about Travis Mills the other day

925
01:29:29.60 --> 01:29:36.64
and unfortunately we didn't have time to do a podcast, but we were talking about stuff and I was like,

926
01:29:36.64 --> 01:29:40.000
well, you know, you have a great story and it's the same thing I feel like saying to you, like, man,

927
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.24
you, you've got a good story, right? You've got a great story. And you think, well, and I said,

928
01:29:44.24 --> 01:29:48.56
halfway through this conversation with Travis, I'm like, hey, bro, I just want to let you know, like,

929
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:54.72
I get that it's not exactly your great story. That you know, you got blown up and lost both

930
01:29:54.72 --> 01:29:58.08
your legs and both your arms and even same thing with you, like, hey, and you're saying it, too,

931
01:29:58.08 --> 01:30:03.04
you're like, hey, I've got a good story. And it's like, okay, I just want to let everyone know,

932
01:30:03.04 --> 01:30:09.04
I get that losing both your legs and Afghanistan is not exactly a good story. However, what you

933
01:30:09.04 --> 01:30:14.08
done with it has you've taken what would be in many cases a horrible story. Yeah. And you actually

934
01:30:14.08 --> 01:30:18.48
truly have turned it into a good story, which is exactly what which is exactly what Travis does.

935
01:30:18.48 --> 01:30:26.96
Well, it's a good story overall with a really bad inciting incident. Yeah. And so that's what it is,

936
01:30:26.96 --> 01:30:31.60
you know, the whole story isn't that one day. It's what happens afterwards. And so that's the

937
01:30:31.60 --> 01:30:35.68
story. But there, yeah, there doesn't mean there's bad. There's not bad things in that story.

938
01:30:35.68 --> 01:30:40.72
But overall, you know, it's probably, I don't know how Travis feels. Maybe I'll ask him if I ever

939
01:30:40.72 --> 01:30:49.92
meet him. But if you ask me, if I went back in time and you asked me a week after I got hurt

940
01:30:50.48 --> 01:30:54.000
or a couple of hours after I got hurt or whatever, whenever I woke up, you know,

941
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.12
would you go back in time and not step on that idea? I'd say, oh, definitely. I'd go, I'd just say,

942
01:30:59.12 --> 01:31:05.60
let's not even go through this area. Let's go around. But you know, I'm in my house now and,

943
01:31:06.56 --> 01:31:11.12
you know, here's a big announcement. We got a baby on the way in Pam. Yeah, thank you.

944
01:31:12.24 --> 01:31:16.40
So we have a baby coming. There's the real announcement. Yeah, there's the real announcement. I should have

945
01:31:16.40 --> 01:31:25.04
said that earlier. A little boy doing February. And we got this nice house. I have a great life,

946
01:31:25.04 --> 01:31:31.04
you know, I think about that. And if somebody asked me right now, if you asked me, if I would go back

947
01:31:31.04 --> 01:31:35.60
in time and not step in the idea, be like hell, no, I would step on that idea, a thousand times,

948
01:31:36.40 --> 01:31:40.96
to be where I am today. And I think that's important to remember about, you know,

949
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:44.08
so it is a good story. If you can have that attitude at the end of it, that's a good story.

950
01:31:45.84 --> 01:31:51.12
There's no doubt about that, man. Dang. You know, as we were talking about leadership and

951
01:31:51.12 --> 01:31:57.20
I was reading through some of the stuff you written, I could not help myself, but to refer back to

952
01:31:57.92 --> 01:32:06.000
the United States Marine Corps leadership traits. Of course. And these traits are originally,

953
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.40
I think, I think the first place that I saw is in the Marine Corps Warfighting Publication 6

954
01:32:12.40 --> 01:32:19.04
TAC 11, which is called leading Marines. And it's in a bunch of other, they quote this all the time.

955
01:32:19.04 --> 01:32:26.24
Yeah. They quote this all the time. The particular comments that I have around here came from

956
01:32:26.24 --> 01:32:30.32
the Commander's Leadership Handbook, which was came out. It's a Marine Corps publication. It's not

957
01:32:30.32 --> 01:32:38.32
it's not an official publication, but it's something that they put out in 2016. And they made some

958
01:32:38.32 --> 01:32:47.20
comments around the US Marine Corps leadership traits. JGA did tie buckle. Right. What's that

959
01:32:47.20 --> 01:32:52.48
called when you do that? Is it called the, the NAC? Yeah, it's an acronym, I guess. But it's also an easy

960
01:32:52.48 --> 01:32:58.48
way to remember things. So they got these, they got these, uh, certain words. That's what it spells out.

961
01:32:58.48 --> 01:33:04.000
It spells out. JGA did tie buckle. I bet it's a buckle that has all the brass. Yeah, probably.

962
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.32
First one is justice. Practice being fair and consistent, base rewards and punishment on merit.

963
01:33:12.32 --> 01:33:19.52
Straight forward, fair and consistent. Judgment. And this is, this is again, as I was thinking

964
01:33:19.52 --> 01:33:22.24
about these, thinking about you, thinking about what you're going to think about what you're

965
01:33:22.24 --> 01:33:27.52
out of two days. Here's what they say about judgment. Consider all sides of an issue before making

966
01:33:27.52 --> 01:33:34.72
a decision. G, what a, what a shocking idea. Yeah. That we would actually consider all sides

967
01:33:34.72 --> 01:33:41.52
of an issue before making a decision. And as a leader, clearly that's something, it's interesting.

968
01:33:41.52 --> 01:33:46.72
Right. You think to yourself, judgment means I make good decisions. That's what judgment means.

969
01:33:46.72 --> 01:33:52.40
I have good judgment. But what they're saying is judgment is you actually just consider the different

970
01:33:52.40 --> 01:33:57.36
angles before you make a decision. They're talking about how you come to that decision. Yeah. Yeah.

971
01:33:57.36 --> 01:34:00.96
And how do you come to that decision by listening? Yeah. That's how you come to that decision.

972
01:34:02.40 --> 01:34:09.20
Dependability. Here's a good one. Beyond time never make your Marines wait on you. What a

973
01:34:09.20 --> 01:34:16.40
stroke of leadership genius. That is never let you never make your Marines wait on you.

974
01:34:16.96 --> 01:34:22.48
And that is something that you see with leaders as they get advanced, as they get promoted.

975
01:34:22.48 --> 01:34:26.72
And all of a sudden, they don't think they need to be on time anymore. They think that everyone

976
01:34:26.72 --> 01:34:37.60
is there waiting for them. And that is just a horrible example to set. Be dependable. Meet deadlines.

977
01:34:37.60 --> 01:34:43.20
Ensure paperwork is processed efficiently and effectively in order to best care for your Marines.

978
01:34:44.56 --> 01:34:48.80
We're here to take care of our Marines. And again, you take this and you apply this to your

979
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:53.68
attitude going into Congress. What do you therefore to take care of your constituents?

980
01:34:53.68 --> 01:34:56.88
Yeah. And they're depending on me to do that. So I have to be dependable to them.

981
01:34:56.88 --> 01:35:02.000
If they had to double check my work all the time, you know, that's kind of the the whole purpose

982
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.68
of a representative, you know, governmental system is that we're trusting, we're depending upon

983
01:35:07.68 --> 01:35:14.40
this one person to represent our, you know, our issues and what we need. And so if they had to

984
01:35:14.40 --> 01:35:19.28
be double checking me all the time, then they might as well just, they think they're,

985
01:35:19.28 --> 01:35:23.12
they're not going to have any time because it's a full time job to figure out all the different

986
01:35:23.12 --> 01:35:26.40
stuff about all these issues and figure out what to do and go in and vote and all that. So they

987
01:35:26.40 --> 01:35:30.16
wouldn't be able to work. Everybody would just be a representative and nobody would ever get anything

988
01:35:30.16 --> 01:35:35.44
down besides running the government. Which would not work. Yeah. They have to depend.

989
01:35:36.40 --> 01:35:42.80
They have to depend on that person. Next up in Tagrity, the most important ingredient of leadership

990
01:35:42.80 --> 01:35:50.000
tell the truth to both your superiors and your Marines. There you go. We talked about truth already.

991
01:35:50.80 --> 01:35:57.36
Always use your authority for mission accomplishment, not for personal gain. That would be a big

992
01:35:57.36 --> 01:36:04.24
one to run across the entire United States government. How much how many people do things for

993
01:36:04.24 --> 01:36:09.12
their personal gain and not for? Yeah. You wonder. The good of the country. You wonder how many people

994
01:36:09.12 --> 01:36:14.88
are just concerned about having a political career. And I'll say right now, I'm willing to

995
01:36:14.88 --> 01:36:19.92
sacrifice any kind of political career and do the right thing. You know, I'll, I'll find something else

996
01:36:19.92 --> 01:36:27.20
if that's what it takes. I'll run 50 marathons. Next one is decisive.

997
01:36:27.20 --> 01:36:34.40
This study your alternatives and take the best possible course of action. No win, not to, no win,

998
01:36:34.40 --> 01:36:38.56
not to step in and make a decision. That's an interesting one from leadership perspective.

999
01:36:40.24 --> 01:36:49.04
I got a new book coming out in January 2020. And I talk a lot about not a lot. There's a

1000
01:36:49.04 --> 01:36:52.80
couple of sections in there where I talk about how to know when to step up and lead it.

1001
01:36:52.80 --> 01:36:57.04
I went into pretty good detail and it's really cool for me to write this stuff because I

1002
01:36:57.04 --> 01:37:01.76
get to sit there from a detached perspective and think of all these situations that I've been in

1003
01:37:01.76 --> 01:37:06.32
and how I would handle them. But one of them is when there's a little bit of a leadership vacuum.

1004
01:37:07.04 --> 01:37:13.28
When do you step in? And I went into this pretty big explanation of, okay, well, obviously there's

1005
01:37:13.28 --> 01:37:18.64
a leadership vacuum and there's like a emergency situation and you see that vacuum you step in there immediately.

1006
01:37:18.64 --> 01:37:24.24
But and this is as I would think about how I would actually do this. If there's a leadership vacuum,

1007
01:37:24.24 --> 01:37:29.04
but there's no critical emergency, my first instinct isn't just to step right in immediately.

1008
01:37:29.04 --> 01:37:32.40
Because I'm going to let that thing develop a little bit. I'm going to see if somebody else

1009
01:37:33.04 --> 01:37:38.08
I'm actually hoping one of my subordinate steps into that leadership vacuum. And then I get to

1010
01:37:38.08 --> 01:37:41.92
stay detached and I get to watch what the decisions they're making and see with the direction. It's all good.

1011
01:37:42.72 --> 01:37:49.20
And then I talked about what happens if two people step into that leadership vacuum at the same time.

1012
01:37:49.68 --> 01:37:53.12
What do you do? What if I step into the leadership vacuum and so does echo Charles?

1013
01:37:53.12 --> 01:37:57.52
At the same time we step into that leadership vacuum. What do I do? Can you guess what I do echo Charles?

1014
01:37:58.16 --> 01:38:01.52
Let me lead. Yes, I immediately go. You know, if you and I both say,

1015
01:38:02.08 --> 01:38:06.80
I say go left, you say go right. Right at that moment. I say go left, you say go right. I go,

1016
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:10.000
hey, all right echo, we're going with your plan. I'm going immediately. Going to do that.

1017
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.20
I mean, considering that there's no major catastrophic incident. If if if somebody steps up and

1018
01:38:15.20 --> 01:38:19.92
take lead, I'm happy to follow. Especially if it's my subordinate. Because now as soon as echo is

1019
01:38:19.92 --> 01:38:23.52
now, I'm going to take that problem and he's going to run with it. I can look around and see what else

1020
01:38:23.52 --> 01:38:29.36
a sea would else is going on. Look at the bigger picture. So yeah, it's interesting when you look at

1021
01:38:29.36 --> 01:38:32.96
these leadership vacuum and how you actually handle them. The other thing I talked about is this,

1022
01:38:33.52 --> 01:38:39.92
this is getting detailed. But if we're in a situation, let's say we're in a putoon and there's a leadership

1023
01:38:39.92 --> 01:38:44.40
vacuum and I immediately try and jump into the leadership vacuum as soon as I see it. Guess what?

1024
01:38:44.40 --> 01:38:48.96
Not everyone else saw that vacuum. Not everyone else felt it and there's people. There's going to be

1025
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:56.72
some resistance to you changing course right now. If I let that situation develop for eight more seconds,

1026
01:38:56.72 --> 01:39:01.76
six more seconds, 20 more seconds, whatever whatever it is, where all of a sudden people go

1027
01:39:01.76 --> 01:39:06.08
way to second, there's a leadership vacuum. Meanwhile, I'm sitting detached and I'm going as soon as

1028
01:39:06.08 --> 01:39:11.28
I, as soon as the moment's right I'm making a call and now everyone is waiting for the call. They're

1029
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:14.64
waiting to be led in by the way, the decision that I'm about to make. I've already assessed that

1030
01:39:14.64 --> 01:39:20.24
it's a good call. So there's all these little things to think about when it comes to being decisive.

1031
01:39:20.24 --> 01:39:26.64
And another thing I say is, be as make your decisions as late as possible, which is a little bit

1032
01:39:26.64 --> 01:39:30.96
weird, right? It sounds counterintuitive. No, you just make a call immediately. No, actually,

1033
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.92
I'll make a, this is what I say. I will make the smallest decision I need to make

1034
01:39:37.92 --> 01:39:41.84
heading in the right direction of what I think the broader decision that needs to be made is.

1035
01:39:41.84 --> 01:39:45.44
So I want just to meet you say, Frank left. No, the first thing I'm going to say is, okay,

1036
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:48.80
get online, put some of the machine gunners over to left. We think we're moving that way,

1037
01:39:48.80 --> 01:39:55.52
but we're not going there yet. So this idea of being decisive has got a lot of little nuance to

1038
01:39:55.52 --> 01:40:01.20
it that you need to think about. Next one, tacked, talk with your Marines, not at them.

1039
01:40:01.20 --> 01:40:06.48
That's a good idea with your constituents, right? Treat others as you would like to be treated,

1040
01:40:06.48 --> 01:40:11.92
be steadfast during crisis, stay calm and steer your command and stormy weather. When reacting

1041
01:40:11.92 --> 01:40:18.32
to bad news, know that initial reports are nearly always wrong and then they throw this out. Listen,

1042
01:40:18.32 --> 01:40:24.32
first. And I had, I think I read a different one because I have some quotes down here,

1043
01:40:24.32 --> 01:40:28.40
but I have, there's all kinds of the Marines that have the all kinds of different,

1044
01:40:28.40 --> 01:40:34.08
and not just official Marines, but just people, human beings. Well, the one that I read,

1045
01:40:34.08 --> 01:40:37.92
had a picture of Chester Polar on it, so I think that's probably the most official. Solid.

1046
01:40:39.20 --> 01:40:43.84
But the one of the quotes for tacked that I liked from the one that I read is,

1047
01:40:45.76 --> 01:40:50.48
this difference must be extended under all conditions regardless of true feelings.

1048
01:40:51.12 --> 01:40:59.92
Yes. So I could hate, I could sit across a table and hate physically hate another legislator,

1049
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:03.44
hate everything they stand for, hate their soul. But I'm going to sit down and listen to them.

1050
01:41:03.44 --> 01:41:08.16
So, okay. That's a good point. Yeah. I'm not going to go on Twitter. Yeah.

1051
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:12.24
And you actually are listening to. Yeah. I will. Yeah. Actually, I've been just playing the game like

1052
01:41:12.24 --> 01:41:15.76
okay. I just got to do this. No, it's like, I'm actually listening to what you're saying. I,

1053
01:41:15.76 --> 01:41:19.28
I actually want to prove myself wrong. Yeah. It's really, I do, I want to be wrong. I want

1054
01:41:19.28 --> 01:41:24.96
you to be like, how much, how much easier is my life? If you and I want to get a project done,

1055
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:28.72
you have a way of doing it, and I have a way of doing it. How much easier and better is it for me,

1056
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:33.28
if your way is works better than mine. Yeah. It makes my whole life easier. Okay, cool. I get you

1057
01:41:33.28 --> 01:41:37.92
got my support 100% of you. Yeah. I know you're voting for you. And as long as it's a good

1058
01:41:37.92 --> 01:41:42.32
plan, guess what? I get to vote for you too. And I'm happy. Yeah. As opposed to me having to argue and

1059
01:41:42.32 --> 01:41:47.92
try and pry your vote from you to meet to do the project the way I said, yeah. That's already

1060
01:41:47.92 --> 01:41:54.72
wasted hours. If not days. If, if you come up with a decent enough plan, brah, Montbord. Yeah.

1061
01:41:55.36 --> 01:42:00.80
And then even at the end, you can, you honestly consider what they said. And then your assessment

1062
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:04.40
is this person, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. You don't say,

1063
01:42:05.36 --> 01:42:09.04
this is a dumbest idea I've ever heard. It's never going to work. You say, okay.

1064
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:14.24
All right. Well, I don't know. Maybe that might not be, yeah. How I would go with it,

1065
01:42:14.24 --> 01:42:19.44
well, what can you consider this? Yeah. And you don't just like, you act tactfully. Yes.

1066
01:42:19.44 --> 01:42:25.92
To act tact. Initiative. Take action, even in the absence of orders from a superior, be a self-starter.

1067
01:42:25.92 --> 01:42:30.88
Plan ahead and have three hip pocket plans for contingencies. Always look to improve,

1068
01:42:30.88 --> 01:42:34.32
learn from your mistakes. Initiative.

1069
01:42:37.20 --> 01:42:41.36
Endurance. I actually was laughing when I read about it.

1070
01:42:41.36 --> 01:42:44.40
I'm especially right. Yeah. I think we'll be okay with endurance.

1071
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:49.76
Maintain mental and physical stamina. No winter recharge. Most people who quit do not give

1072
01:42:49.76 --> 01:42:57.20
up at the bottom of the mountain, they stop halfway up it. So endurance, as I said, I don't think we need

1073
01:42:57.20 --> 01:43:05.76
to even, I think you will, I think you will be the premier endurance person in Congress period.

1074
01:43:05.76 --> 01:43:07.76
I'll become quite good at it. Very good at it.

1075
01:43:09.84 --> 01:43:13.36
Bearing set the example by maintaining high standards and appearance and personal conduct,

1076
01:43:13.36 --> 01:43:21.36
avoid the use of profanity. High-like that, ankle trials. I'm fine with it. At the end of the day,

1077
01:43:23.92 --> 01:43:29.20
be professional, develop gentlemen and ladies and future citizens. Have you heard there's been some

1078
01:43:29.20 --> 01:43:35.76
some pretty high profile politicians that have dropped some language. It gets like immediate press.

1079
01:43:36.40 --> 01:43:40.64
Yeah. Let's see if you drop the F-ball. If you drop the F-ball, I'm on national television.

1080
01:43:40.64 --> 01:43:45.60
You're going to get some coverage. You may not be good. May not be bad. I don't know. You can't be good.

1081
01:43:45.60 --> 01:43:53.84
Yeah. I think one of this general madness recently is a great example for all of these lists.

1082
01:43:53.84 --> 01:43:59.04
Especially lately for this because he came out with his book and he's constantly being

1083
01:44:00.32 --> 01:44:04.56
picked at by people that are doing interviews like say something about Trump. Say something about

1084
01:44:04.56 --> 01:44:09.44
Trump. And he's come out so many times saying, I'm not going to comment about a sitting president

1085
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:13.20
and they just keep asking and they ask, I'm going to do it for a while. And he's just

1086
01:44:14.56 --> 01:44:22.40
he maintains his bearing. Yeah. He does indeed. Unselfishness, care for your Marines above yourself,

1087
01:44:22.40 --> 01:44:27.20
boom. Once again, that goes back to your constituents. Yeah. Taking care of your constituents,

1088
01:44:27.20 --> 01:44:31.36
not, and you just said, it's not about your political career. Take every action to provide for

1089
01:44:31.36 --> 01:44:40.72
the welfare of your Marines. They always come first. Courage. Take measure risk and combat and

1090
01:44:40.72 --> 01:44:45.76
peace at Combin firmly and stressful situation stand up for what is right. regards what others think.

1091
01:44:49.12 --> 01:44:54.000
Except personal responsibility for your orders and for your mistakes. I think they should

1092
01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.32
actually call that something else like extreme owners. I want to run that even in the face of

1093
01:45:00.32 --> 01:45:07.92
popular, disfavor. What you're doing. So you have to do it even when. If you know that it's

1094
01:45:07.92 --> 01:45:12.24
if you believe that it's the right thing to do no matter how many people are telling you,

1095
01:45:12.24 --> 01:45:17.20
it's the wrong thing. You have to have to have the courage to stand out from the group and put

1096
01:45:17.20 --> 01:45:23.84
yourself out there. And what makes that work, what makes that not an extreme is the fact that has to

1097
01:45:23.84 --> 01:45:28.24
be balanced with the humility to listen to other people. Right? Because if I'm just saying, well,

1098
01:45:28.24 --> 01:45:31.76
you know, this is what I believe and I'm sticking with it. But I'm not listening to everyone else.

1099
01:45:31.76 --> 01:45:35.92
That's a problem. If I'm listening to people, but I'm coming up with my judgment and my judgment is the

1100
01:45:35.92 --> 01:45:40.48
same. And I'm listening to more people. And people are telling me, no, that's you shouldn't do it. That

1101
01:45:40.48 --> 01:45:45.28
way it's going to lose your next election. But you believe it's the right thing to do. You do it.

1102
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:54.16
That's courage. Correct Marines when required. That's that's a good one.

1103
01:45:54.16 --> 01:46:00.88
Because you would think that that's so easy in the military. You know, somebody steps out of line.

1104
01:46:00.88 --> 01:46:06.24
You just straight them out. I mean, it's kind of interesting because in the sealed teams,

1105
01:46:06.24 --> 01:46:10.56
I know that's hard. It's interesting that the Marine Corps finds that hard as well.

1106
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:18.64
Because the Marine Corps more rank sensitive, right? The sealed teams is not rank sensitive.

1107
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:24.08
It's basically open. It's almost completely open. But it's definitely

1108
01:46:24.08 --> 01:46:29.44
more open than Marine Corps trust me. But you would think that in the Marine Corps, hey,

1109
01:46:29.44 --> 01:46:33.52
if Lance Corp will do something stupid, you're just going to straighten them out immediately.

1110
01:46:33.52 --> 01:46:39.36
And that's true to some extent. But when you get to, hey, you know, you got somebody maybe that's

1111
01:46:39.36 --> 01:46:45.04
your peer that's doing something wrong. Are you going to say something? And it becomes a lot more

1112
01:46:45.04 --> 01:46:50.64
challenging. Allow some ordinance to make decisions. Yeah, that takes courage as well.

1113
01:46:50.64 --> 01:46:58.48
Knowledge works, works towards technical tactical administrative excellence. Read, study, think,

1114
01:46:58.48 --> 01:47:07.52
write and teach. Think about that. Read, study, think, write and teach. Those things are so

1115
01:47:07.52 --> 01:47:13.36
underrated. Read, study, think, write and teach. And actually, I think think

1116
01:47:13.36 --> 01:47:25.44
should go forth. No, it should go last. Because all those other things allow you to think.

1117
01:47:25.44 --> 01:47:29.44
Those are things that make you think. If you want, if you read something you have to think about,

1118
01:47:29.44 --> 01:47:33.44
if you study something you think about it, if when you write out your thoughts or even talk about

1119
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:40.000
your thoughts, that's going to make you think. And it's going to make you home those thoughts.

1120
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And teaching them absolutely will do that. You learn not in GJC, the more you teach those

1121
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.40
moves, the better you get out of. Loyalty display faithfulness to your country, the core,

1122
01:47:50.40 --> 01:47:55.68
to your unit, to your seniors, to your subordinates and to your peers. Defend your

1123
01:47:55.68 --> 01:48:01.84
Marines against unfair treatment. Display enthusiasm, carrying out an order, even if you

1124
01:48:01.84 --> 01:48:07.44
may privately disagree. Now, here's where I got to, you know, I thought about that one a little bit.

1125
01:48:07.44 --> 01:48:14.80
Because if I privately disagree and it's relatively minor, cool, we're going to carry it out.

1126
01:48:15.44 --> 01:48:20.72
The more, the alls I'm saying is that you reach to a point, you can reach a point where if you're

1127
01:48:20.72 --> 01:48:24.56
telling me to do something that makes no sense whatsoever, it's going to get people killed or it's

1128
01:48:24.56 --> 01:48:35.76
immoral, illegal or unethical, I'm not going to carry it out. And there's a hole, there's a hole,

1129
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:44.72
just gray area around that one. Because if sometimes if you don't carry it out, you're going to

1130
01:48:44.72 --> 01:48:51.20
get fired. And now you don't have any influence anymore, which is not, which is possibly not a good

1131
01:48:51.20 --> 01:49:00.000
outcome. So enthusiasm. I don't think, I don't think this is another one. I think you just

1132
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.88
win that category. Why wrote this one down is, I wrote, my one note underneath it was belief.

1133
01:49:07.60 --> 01:49:12.56
Based on what I read, and since you have to believe that what you're doing is possible,

1134
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:18.64
even if you think it maybe there's not a great likelihood, like I believed that when I was going

1135
01:49:18.64 --> 01:49:24.48
through a danger area looking for ideas that I would get to the other side, you know, uningered.

1136
01:49:24.48 --> 01:49:29.76
And I had to have that belief in order to be able to do it. I had to believe that there was

1137
01:49:29.76 --> 01:49:34.96
at least a small chance that I could run 31 back to back Marathons. But I didn't believe it at all.

1138
01:49:34.96 --> 01:49:40.24
I would ran one and then just been like, I quit. So, and then, you know, in Congress, you have to

1139
01:49:40.24 --> 01:49:46.16
believe that you can make a difference. You have to believe that you can convince this other person

1140
01:49:46.16 --> 01:49:50.64
or learn something from that other person that will convince you, you have to actually believe that.

1141
01:49:50.64 --> 01:49:56.32
So that's kind of how I interpreted the enthusiasm one. Yeah, like I said, I think you're,

1142
01:49:56.32 --> 01:50:03.12
I think I think endurance and enthusiasm. I think anyone had a hard time sort of stepping up to the

1143
01:50:03.12 --> 01:50:11.36
plate with you in those respects. And then that wraps up, you know, these leadership traits from the

1144
01:50:11.36 --> 01:50:18.40
Marine Corps. And, you know, it's probably a pretty good place to wrap up what were, you know,

1145
01:50:18.40 --> 01:50:22.80
this podcast, except for one more thing. And that's, we talked a lot about what you're doing right now.

1146
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:31.28
People are going to want to support you because they listen to the podcast, they're patriots.

1147
01:50:31.76 --> 01:50:38.64
They want to have reasonable human beings running the government, not crazy people. So,

1148
01:50:39.84 --> 01:50:47.04
what's the best way to, for everyone to support what you're doing to get you the, the funds that

1149
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:55.36
you need to support that you need. How do we do that? Yeah, well, you know, there's a lot of different ways.

1150
01:50:55.36 --> 01:51:00.000
You kind of were in a difficult period, you know, in our country and we have what we were talking

1151
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.84
about with the poison is slowly making its way into the government and feeding out into the

1152
01:51:05.84 --> 01:51:12.32
society and it's kind of breaking apart, you know, the glue that holds us together. And so we do need to

1153
01:51:12.32 --> 01:51:18.08
make sure that, you know, a lot of people are going to, I know that a lot of the people that

1154
01:51:18.08 --> 01:51:23.28
listen to this podcast, I'm not going to directly represent them in Virginia 10, which is, you know,

1155
01:51:23.28 --> 01:51:30.56
Northern Virginia. But we have, you know, everybody knows that the decisions that are made

1156
01:51:31.44 --> 01:51:37.20
in the federal government, they affect everybody in some way. So, I do think that we all have a

1157
01:51:37.20 --> 01:51:44.80
responsibility to make sure that the correct people get elected in every office and in every location.

1158
01:51:46.80 --> 01:51:55.76
And I truly believe that I can be, I have the, the JJ did type buckle attributes to be a person

1159
01:51:55.76 --> 01:51:59.92
that can go to Congress and, and how a positive effect I'm not going to do it all by myself. I'm

1160
01:51:59.92 --> 01:52:05.92
not going to go in there and be the one person that saves the world or anything. But I do think that I

1161
01:52:05.92 --> 01:52:09.60
can start taking it back in that, that other direction, you know, get what they and cringe,

1162
01:52:09.60 --> 01:52:14.40
I'll get with Brian Mass and form these, you know, these coalitions that we can start

1163
01:52:15.36 --> 01:52:20.96
having a positive effect on, on the way things are going in Congress. So there's a couple

1164
01:52:20.96 --> 01:52:24.88
different ways that people can help. They can, you know, there's volunteering. If you do live in my

1165
01:52:24.88 --> 01:52:30.24
district, you can, you can volunteer and you can, we will need people to go out and knock on doors

1166
01:52:30.24 --> 01:52:35.44
and pass out stuff and make phone calls and that kind of thing eventually. You can just tell

1167
01:52:35.44 --> 01:52:42.56
people, spread the word about, you know, who I am and that I'm running. But I think the way that

1168
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:46.72
people can have the greatest impact is what we were talking about before and it is the fundraising.

1169
01:52:49.52 --> 01:52:53.92
You know, if I could, I hate asking for money. And if I could fund this whole thing myself,

1170
01:52:53.92 --> 01:53:00.08
if I had millions of dollars, then I would. But, you know, I'm from humble means, I don't, I simply

1171
01:53:00.08 --> 01:53:03.76
don't have, you know, I don't have the money. And you're doing this on myself. Your wife's run

1172
01:53:03.76 --> 01:53:09.84
the farm right now, right? Yeah, Pam's run in the farm. And so, you know, are you guys selling food?

1173
01:53:09.84 --> 01:53:12.96
Are you guys putting some stuff on the farm? Yeah, she goes down to the farmers market every Saturday

1174
01:53:12.96 --> 01:53:17.76
and she sells vegetables and she'll be selling eggs soon. So yeah, you know, we were how many chickens

1175
01:53:17.76 --> 01:53:23.60
you got? We got 40. Yeah, man. We just started getting, they just started laying eggs.

1176
01:53:24.48 --> 01:53:28.96
So we're starting to get like seven eight eggs. And I'll only eat five every day so I can't keep

1177
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:34.24
up with them. But they're, we're going to start selling eggs. And then so yeah, the farm is really

1178
01:53:34.24 --> 01:53:39.04
taken off for Pam. And she's, you know, obviously she's a incredibly supportive of what I'm doing

1179
01:53:39.04 --> 01:53:45.60
and I wouldn't be doing it without her support. Yeah. So we're, you know, we're a humble family.

1180
01:53:45.60 --> 01:53:51.04
And you know, it's simply don't have the money. And we are talking, my, you know, the current representative,

1181
01:53:51.04 --> 01:53:55.92
she's raised over a million dollars already just this year. Because he has those apparatus

1182
01:53:55.92 --> 01:54:02.96
in place and she's the incumbent. So she gets a lot of support. So we are talking about that kind of

1183
01:54:03.36 --> 01:54:11.20
dollar sign where it costs millions of dollars to buy the advertising on the TV, on Facebook,

1184
01:54:11.20 --> 01:54:16.32
on Instagram, on Twitter, and all these different places by the road signs, by the flyers, you know,

1185
01:54:16.32 --> 01:54:22.72
by cards, all these things that takes millions of millions of dollars. So, you know, if everybody

1186
01:54:22.72 --> 01:54:27.52
that listens to this podcast, if you, I know a lot of people write in questions,

1187
01:54:28.48 --> 01:54:32.24
saying when is John, why don't you go and life, going to start running for office?

1188
01:54:32.96 --> 01:54:36.000
You know, everybody asks that. And he listened the hard fact is,

1189
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.64
John goes not running for office. He's leading in a different way in a just as important way,

1190
01:54:41.28 --> 01:54:47.04
you know, leading in society and in business too. And so he's not running for office. And

1191
01:54:47.04 --> 01:54:52.48
life isn't running for office either. But so this is your opportunity here. You've heard what I think.

1192
01:54:52.48 --> 01:54:57.52
I've been on the podcast three times. I read the books. I am on board with the extreme ownership

1193
01:54:57.52 --> 01:55:02.40
mentality and the attitudes. So this is an opportunity for people that want to see somebody that

1194
01:55:02.40 --> 01:55:09.92
is bought into this in Congress. This is your opportunity to help make that happen. And so if you

1195
01:55:09.92 --> 01:55:16.32
want to donate, you go to Rob Jones for Congress dot com slash donate. And even if it's a dollar,

1196
01:55:17.12 --> 01:55:23.60
$10 whatever, I know you still get around a million downloads, uh, provide cast on like that.

1197
01:55:23.60 --> 01:55:27.12
John, what about that? Yeah. So let's say a million people donate a dollar. That's a million

1198
01:55:27.12 --> 01:55:34.56
box that is huge. That puts me way, way, way far ahead in the game. And the game. Yeah. And

1199
01:55:34.56 --> 01:55:43.04
so that's the best way. And you know, do it now. As you're listening to this, just get on your

1200
01:55:43.04 --> 01:55:49.68
phone and do it right now. It's it's pretty quick. Don't make me like be like my friend Frank

1201
01:55:49.68 --> 01:55:57.52
and have to chase them out three times Frank, you know, don't be Frank. And do it now. And if you

1202
01:55:57.52 --> 01:56:04.40
really can't do it now, send yourself a notification. So as you remember, call your wife, send

1203
01:56:04.40 --> 01:56:12.24
her voice mail and say, hey, remind me to donate when I get home. So take ownership of that as well.

1204
01:56:12.24 --> 01:56:17.28
And so this is your opportunity. So that's the best way. And that's going to the way that people

1205
01:56:17.28 --> 01:56:24.16
can help them. Something I noticed yesterday that you have, so you had your Facebook, your Twitter,

1206
01:56:24.16 --> 01:56:29.68
your Instagram and your YouTube. And your old one used to be called Rob Jones journey. Yeah.

1207
01:56:29.68 --> 01:56:34.56
Right. And now that is that gone? No, that's still there. Uh, now you have Rob Jones for Congress

1208
01:56:34.56 --> 01:56:42.16
and on Facebook. You have at Rob Jones VA on Twitter and Rob Jones for Congress on the Graham.

1209
01:56:42.16 --> 01:56:49.84
The Graham. Yeah. Yeah. So the reason that I have, I'm trying to keep Rob Jones journey in

1210
01:56:49.84 --> 01:56:53.60
the political stuff separate. Because I know the people that follow me on Rob Jones journey don't

1211
01:56:53.60 --> 01:56:57.76
necessarily want to see political stuff all the time. So I'm trying to keep those two things

1212
01:56:57.76 --> 01:57:02.48
separate. So that's why I have the different handles for, you know, for this project. And yeah,

1213
01:57:02.48 --> 01:57:07.20
it's interesting. That's interesting call. I don't agree with it. Yeah. It definitely, you know,

1214
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:12.08
it would be it'd be a bonus to have the 8,000, you know, Instagram followers that I have all

1215
01:57:12.08 --> 01:57:17.36
getting my, you know, political stuff. But I can do, I kind of want to make sure that I maintain that

1216
01:57:17.36 --> 01:57:23.52
that separation. Yeah. So that's another thing. It's just follow Rob Jones. Yeah. Follow me on all these

1217
01:57:23.52 --> 01:57:34.48
things. Smash the follow button. Sure. Awesome. Well, that's, that's like, that's where we got to do.

1218
01:57:34.48 --> 01:57:42.80
We got to give you some support and get you the funds that you need to make this happen.

1219
01:57:42.80 --> 01:57:49.20
Yes. And yeah, like I said, I had asked him for money. But it's the the down fortunate part.

1220
01:57:49.20 --> 01:57:54.80
It's the way the system works right now. It's the way you play the game. It's the way you play the game.

1221
01:57:54.80 --> 01:58:03.44
And we play the win. All right. Echo. Yes. Rob, we got Rob here. Obviously he's, you know, on the path

1222
01:58:04.72 --> 01:58:11.68
multiple ways. Is there anything that we need to do kind of get on the path over here on our side?

1223
01:58:11.68 --> 01:58:16.72
Can I bring up a few more things? I had like like just a couple funny things at the end.

1224
01:58:16.72 --> 01:58:23.20
Now that we're doing support. Yeah. Yeah. We're in support mode. Yes. Okay. My first thing. This is

1225
01:58:23.20 --> 01:58:28.80
directed directly at Echo Charles. Sure. You know how you guys were talking. You were doing the

1226
01:58:29.84 --> 01:58:36.64
the Marine Corps, you know, grading system for everybody. Yeah. What was the, the number 174

1227
01:58:36.64 --> 01:58:40.40
Eminemly. Yeah. And any qualifying. And below that. What was the one below that? I don't, I don't know.

1228
01:58:40.40 --> 01:58:47.36
Doesn't matter to you. Yeah. So that's what this is. Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people have this problem.

1229
01:58:47.36 --> 01:58:51.76
Where I'll be listening to the podcast and you guys will be talking about some and I want to

1230
01:58:51.76 --> 01:58:57.52
cut into the podcast. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh. Here's something funny that I could say. So I'm sure a lot of

1231
01:58:57.52 --> 01:59:01.20
people have that problem. And the vast majority of the time, I'm listening to the podcast when I'm

1232
01:59:01.20 --> 01:59:05.84
working out or driving in the car or something. So I can't write it down. But this one stuck in my mind.

1233
01:59:05.84 --> 01:59:15.52
And so it was when Echo Charles, he was talking about. He said the expertly qualified

1234
01:59:16.32 --> 01:59:21.84
Mario player is the, is the, is the, the man, the person that can go through the entire

1235
01:59:21.84 --> 01:59:28.24
Super Mario game with one guy. I won't be working out by the way without warping. And I just wanted

1236
01:59:28.24 --> 01:59:35.68
to bring up that the eminently qualified Super Mario Brothers player would be the people that

1237
01:59:35.68 --> 01:59:43.44
can do the whole game one guy in less than four minutes, which is the world record. Yeah. So that's a

1238
01:59:43.44 --> 01:59:48.72
good thought. But when you go, when you go into these, don't get robbed any money for getting

1239
01:59:48.72 --> 01:59:57.60
you out. It's triggered. I'm not gonna disagree. I'm not gonna disagree. I'll agree, but with additional

1240
01:59:57.60 --> 02:00:02.40
stuff. So I wouldn't say that that would be the standard because you can go, okay, I can go for time

1241
02:00:02.40 --> 02:00:09.36
for sure. Or I could go for points and get all the coins. Same. Same. Then you could go, I can go

1242
02:00:09.36 --> 02:00:17.28
for time and coins or time and points. Same. So because if you just go for coins, you're not killing

1243
02:00:17.92 --> 02:00:21.68
everybody. If you're going for time and coins. Yeah. Yeah. But if you're going for time and points,

1244
02:00:21.68 --> 02:00:26.72
you're going for coins, killing everybody as fast as you can. So I think that might be the, well,

1245
02:00:27.28 --> 02:00:31.60
that's a very good point. You're the same. And maybe we'll let the, let the listeners decide.

1246
02:00:31.60 --> 02:00:36.000
And the thing is I know that because I've tried that for the time. And I remember it. Oh,

1247
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.72
I'm doing it. No, I didn't do it. I did not break the record, but I do remember, hey, I didn't kill

1248
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:44.80
anybody. I skipped so many coins, which I usually get because I care about how many mana have.

1249
02:00:44.80 --> 02:00:49.36
Same. Same. You know, 100 coins, get an extra man. Okay. I'm saying. Yeah, I don't really,

1250
02:00:49.36 --> 02:00:54.80
I don't know how this ties in 100%. But it does tie in some percent. So when we would be,

1251
02:00:54.80 --> 02:00:59.92
when I first got the teams, we would do like shooting competitions. Yeah. And, you know,

1252
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:04.24
you'd have to run to this spot, shoot, hear shoot these number of targets, run to a different spot,

1253
02:01:04.24 --> 02:01:08.72
throw the put on the Rucksack, drag it, whatever you do this stuff, and then you shoot more targets.

1254
02:01:09.52 --> 02:01:14.80
And if you missed the target, it was like a certain deduction, right? And there would be somebody

1255
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:20.72
that would just go, you know what? They would figure it out in their head that the shooting didn't

1256
02:01:20.72 --> 02:01:27.04
really. If the person didn't set up the course correctly, I could just run through this thing, just dump rounds.

1257
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:35.04
And with that is 100%. And then everyone would look at that guy that did that and just think

1258
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:41.76
loser, right? To just not eat to just, hey, I'm just going to, I'm going to win the technicality

1259
02:01:41.76 --> 02:01:49.52
of this game, but without, without really truly encompassing the spirit or embracing the spirit of

1260
02:01:49.52 --> 02:01:58.24
the game. So that would almost be like, if you did that, you were going to get shunned from the group.

1261
02:01:58.80 --> 02:02:03.52
Yeah, I can do that. I mean, I'm so far ahead of the doesn't have that spirit of like killing everything.

1262
02:02:03.52 --> 02:02:08.08
You do a kind of because you have to or, you know, it helps you whatever. So I get the time thing.

1263
02:02:08.08 --> 02:02:13.20
And four minutes, I don't think you could do all 32 levels in four minutes. No, they usually want to use glitches in the game.

1264
02:02:14.24 --> 02:02:15.52
Okay, that's a good one. That's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.

1265
02:02:15.52 --> 02:02:20.16
We're defeating the spirit. Yeah. So we're all, we're kind of on the level then, right?

1266
02:02:20.16 --> 02:02:25.28
Yeah, we are fully. And so I guess, and I kind of get though too like, okay, you're just going to run

1267
02:02:25.28 --> 02:02:28.48
through the course throw rounds down range and you don't care, but you're going to win, right?

1268
02:02:28.48 --> 02:02:32.72
You can do it. Save the princess. Yeah, save the princess. You can look at it and say,

1269
02:02:32.72 --> 02:02:37.12
you know what, hey, I won. Whatever. Save the princess. Yeah. But then we get back to what we were talking

1270
02:02:37.12 --> 02:02:41.76
about earlier. Are you really going to throw your morals out the window just to get the W.

1271
02:02:41.76 --> 02:02:47.92
Just get the world record. My recommendation is no, don't do that. You have a mark on the

1272
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:53.52
decision. Okay. You play the game correctly. Yes, my recommendation. Well, okay. So. All right,

1273
02:02:53.52 --> 02:02:58.40
that's point number one off point that point number one. Okay. The next one is a story. And I found

1274
02:02:58.40 --> 02:03:05.68
it to be interesting, but stop me if you've already heard it. And there's a story about an African-American

1275
02:03:05.68 --> 02:03:13.36
boy when Washington was crossing the Delaware. So he was coming up across the Delaware on Christmas

1276
02:03:13.36 --> 02:03:19.68
day. And there were the an African-American man and an African-American son. And he the the man

1277
02:03:19.68 --> 02:03:24.48
wanted to join the army to help General Washington. And the boy wanted to fight as well, but he was

1278
02:03:24.48 --> 02:03:29.92
too young, he was about 11. General Washington said you're too young. But what you can do for us,

1279
02:03:29.92 --> 02:03:36.08
is you can stay back here on this side of the river and you can mind the horses and you can hold

1280
02:03:36.08 --> 02:03:42.80
this, you can make sure that this lantern stays a light to be it so that we know where we can go.

1281
02:03:42.80 --> 02:03:48.32
They would guide us back after the after we win the battle. And that night they they went in

1282
02:03:48.32 --> 02:03:53.36
they they won the battle and it was a freezing cold night and that little boy they came back.

1283
02:03:53.36 --> 02:04:01.20
He had frozen to death, but the lantern was still lit and that little boy's name, Jocco.

1284
02:04:03.20 --> 02:04:08.08
So that's your that before? Well, you know, I don't know, I had not heard that before. You know,

1285
02:04:08.08 --> 02:04:12.48
have you ever seen the little Jockey? Yeah, that's where I saw him. That's yeah, that I know that

1286
02:04:12.48 --> 02:04:18.08
that guy is called Jocco. Well, that's the legend. It came in. He is a little African-American little

1287
02:04:18.08 --> 02:04:24.16
Jockey dude. Yeah. Exactly. No, apparently General Washington, and this is all, you know,

1288
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:27.44
legend or whatever. I don't know if it actually happened, but I know because this sounds like there could

1289
02:04:27.44 --> 02:04:33.04
be some urban legend to this whole thing. So apparently we don't know if this is true. Apparently General

1290
02:04:33.04 --> 02:04:38.56
Washington, he had a memorial statue built and that's what the little Jockey statue is.

1291
02:04:39.12 --> 02:04:44.000
And then those statues were supposedly used in the underground railroad to tell people

1292
02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:51.28
where they were safe. Okay, so that's that one. Okay. And my last one, it's kind of serious

1293
02:04:52.56 --> 02:04:59.52
because I actually have beef. Jocco and I have beef. I know. So here's what happened.

1294
02:05:00.08 --> 02:05:06.72
We need to squash it. Here's what happened. Moved into a nice little town called Middleburg.

1295
02:05:06.72 --> 02:05:13.44
Actually, I was having a house built in Middleburg and earlier this year was finally finished.

1296
02:05:14.96 --> 02:05:19.28
And while this house is being built, I was living in Vienna, Virginia, and then Leesburg,

1297
02:05:19.28 --> 02:05:24.40
Virginia, which are all kind of around Middleburg, Virginia. And after I went on the podcast

1298
02:05:24.40 --> 02:05:31.28
second time, I was contacted by a guy that I know, and then you know, I think echo Charles and

1299
02:05:31.28 --> 02:05:39.60
Ozam, his name is Dave Burke. Good deal, Dave. It's contacted by this gentleman.

1300
02:05:40.72 --> 02:05:45.60
And he said, let's meet up sometime. Posted, okay, where do you live? He said, I live in Aldi.

1301
02:05:45.60 --> 02:05:51.68
Aldi, Virginia. And I went on that, I was like, oh, that's like five miles from where I live.

1302
02:05:51.68 --> 02:05:57.44
Well, I'm going to be living in a Middleburg. And then like, oh, man, all right, I'm going to have a friend.

1303
02:05:57.44 --> 02:06:03.04
Got a neighbor out in Middleburg. They didn't have a built in neighbor. And then we build the house.

1304
02:06:03.60 --> 02:06:10.48
I'm about to move in. And I see a Facebook post by this Dave Burke says, the the

1305
02:06:10.48 --> 02:06:18.40
Berks are moving. I go, you guys are moving? Right, what I'm moving in? And Dave says,

1306
02:06:18.40 --> 02:06:24.56
yeah, well, you know, Jocco had this big opportunity for me out here in San Diego. So the beef

1307
02:06:24.56 --> 02:06:30.08
is that Jocco stole my friend. Dang, friend and neighbor stole and well, if it makes you

1308
02:06:30.08 --> 02:06:34.56
feel even better, which it probably won't when he did announce to us or to me anyway,

1309
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:38.56
that he was coming to California. I was fired up too. Like, how you weren't fired up? I was

1310
02:06:38.56 --> 02:06:42.56
in Versus fired up. You know, opposite. And then he moves out of here, moves up to Carl's back.

1311
02:06:43.60 --> 02:06:48.32
So it's like, you know, another one of those deals, man. So think both. Yeah, that's the thing last

1312
02:06:48.32 --> 02:06:53.60
not I was here. Originally, me and Dave were going to meet up at fills. Yeah, yeah. And there was

1313
02:06:53.60 --> 02:06:58.000
a possibility. There was a possibility that you were going to call. Yeah, because fills as we know

1314
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:06.72
is 200 meters from victory MMA and fitness. It is it is possibly my favorite, um,

1315
02:07:07.68 --> 02:07:11.04
oh, it's definitely my favorite barbecue now. I'm actually not, I'm not going to play around.

1316
02:07:11.04 --> 02:07:17.52
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we can get Dave going well. No, no, why the burger? No, no,

1317
02:07:17.52 --> 02:07:21.84
Dave's got the Salt Lake. He's got another, he's got a couple. Dave's got a couple, but you know,

1318
02:07:21.84 --> 02:07:31.52
for him being from Texas, anything like to even consider the fact that a barbecue outside of Texas

1319
02:07:31.52 --> 02:07:38.96
could be your number one. You, that is, that is blasphemy for life. 100% blasphemy. So yes,

1320
02:07:38.96 --> 02:07:43.92
fills barbecue. And I'll tell you what, Tim Kennedy came up and he lives in Texas. And I took

1321
02:07:43.92 --> 02:07:49.92
him to fills and I said, hey, bros, just stand by and he had cut weight for like a photo,

1322
02:07:49.92 --> 02:07:56.64
shoot or something. And so he was all starving and I took him over there and, um, yeah, there's no

1323
02:07:56.64 --> 02:08:02.80
tonight. So when you, you said to me, hey, I'm going to go out for dinner with Dave Burka. Can you go?

1324
02:08:02.80 --> 02:08:07.76
And I was like, it's, you know, depends. You know, so I said, possible. Yeah. And I actually knew

1325
02:08:07.76 --> 02:08:12.64
that it was probably not possible, but then I thought, well, if they're going to fills

1326
02:08:12.64 --> 02:08:21.12
and I get done training and I can go over there and get, get it done in 35 to 40 minutes,

1327
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I was thinking maybe I'll just go for it. You make time for fills. Yeah. Well, it's a,

1328
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.96
wouldn't you, the net loss because it's going to take me, it's going to take me, you know,

1329
02:08:30.96 --> 02:08:36.96
17 minutes to eat anyways, right? Yeah. So the net loss is like probably what, what,

1330
02:08:36.96 --> 02:08:41.52
what, around 15 minutes total. We could have ordered for you. So I was ready to roll right in there.

1331
02:08:41.52 --> 02:08:46.96
It would have been a game changer. Yeah. So now we're talking like a 12 minute scenario.

1332
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:54.24
So I get in and Dave Burk calls me and he says, oh, hey, you know, the, the wife and kids

1333
02:08:54.24 --> 02:08:58.32
Whitney and the kids that really want to see you, too. I'm like, okay, yeah, that's fair. So

1334
02:08:58.32 --> 02:09:03.36
bring them to fills. Yeah. Yeah. He said, once you come over to our house,

1335
02:09:03.92 --> 02:09:08.48
like, oh, okay, yeah, that, that, that's not where I, he said he was moving to San Diego. He didn't say,

1336
02:09:08.48 --> 02:09:12.48
so I was like, oh, I'll probably just be a couple of minutes away. Yeah. Like, okay, maybe

1337
02:09:12.48 --> 02:09:16.64
Jocca, okay, so come to that. We'll still have a good time. He was like, all right, cool. Maybe you can jump

1338
02:09:16.64 --> 02:09:22.24
into it. And he said, come on up and I look in the address that he gives me, it's 45 minutes away.

1339
02:09:23.20 --> 02:09:25.84
And I'm like, can you still come and drag was like, nope.

1340
02:09:25.84 --> 02:09:32.08
No, like, when you go in for dinner, I'm praying that it's going to say fills, be new,

1341
02:09:32.08 --> 02:09:38.88
cute. But it says Dave was nice enough to invite us over to San Diego. Nope.

1342
02:09:40.08 --> 02:09:44.56
Have a good dinner. That's a juicer. Do you Uber up there? Yeah, Uber up there. And then Uber home?

1343
02:09:45.60 --> 02:09:51.20
Hey. Yeah. Um, you're getting a whole new slew of donations just to cover the Uber

1344
02:09:51.20 --> 02:09:59.20
cost. Well, no, no, no, no, you can't use those funds. You have to, I got to do another speaking

1345
02:09:59.20 --> 02:10:04.08
engagement or something. Yeah. I'm going to have to sell some eggs. Exactly. But to be fair,

1346
02:10:04.08 --> 02:10:10.48
the evening was very pleasant. And obviously Dave's family is great. And his wife made some great

1347
02:10:10.48 --> 02:10:16.24
baked Zidi that we thoroughly enjoyed. So it was a very fun evening. But he did kind of trick me.

1348
02:10:16.24 --> 02:10:21.20
Here's the crazy thing. So Dave, the chairs all fired up, you know, and I'm fired up because Dave's

1349
02:10:21.20 --> 02:10:26.08
like, one of the best people ever. And he's moving out San Diego, you know, and it's I'm super stoked.

1350
02:10:26.08 --> 02:10:31.12
And then the Carl's bad word comes in. We're a little bit, you know, we're not quite, you know.

1351
02:10:31.84 --> 02:10:37.52
But here's the funny thing. You know, how many times have seen Dave since he moved out here? Like

1352
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:43.60
three times. I'm not even kidding because he's on the road all the time working. I'm on the road all the time

1353
02:10:43.60 --> 02:10:51.12
working. So it's cool. We've seen each other three times. But, you know, it's not that cool.

1354
02:10:51.12 --> 02:10:55.92
Hopefully you'll improve over time. Yeah. Yeah. So those are pretty good beefs. Any other other beefs

1355
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:00.56
with me? The beef is squash. You want to hear something weird? Like when you tell me you have beef with me,

1356
02:11:00.56 --> 02:11:05.52
I'm not kidding. Why are you telling me serious? No, no, no, no, but like I was like, okay,

1357
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:11.36
like, I mean, I got into a. Yeah, you're in the pocket. I was like, you're in the pocket.

1358
02:11:11.36 --> 02:11:17.76
Okay. Hopefully I have this. Yeah, they're one over here. Did you see MazdaVal after his fight?

1359
02:11:17.76 --> 02:11:20.56
And someone's like, you know, you have beef with this guy? He goes, he goes, no, no, no,

1360
02:11:20.56 --> 02:11:23.20
I don't have beef. If I be for the might be waiting for him outside of his house.

1361
02:11:23.20 --> 02:11:28.24
Yeah, that was legit. MazdaVal is fighting. May deas.

1362
02:11:31.84 --> 02:11:36.80
But I thought that was legit when he says, no, I don't have beef. No, if we had beef,

1363
02:11:36.80 --> 02:11:42.000
I would be waiting outside of his house. That's what would be happening. So you and I don't have beef.

1364
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.40
No. Well, that was just a funny thing. Because when you said we had beef, I was like,

1365
02:11:46.40 --> 02:11:50.32
oh, we're getting into the knife. Chopin triggered. You saw.

1366
02:11:50.32 --> 02:11:58.64
Oh, that's all my comments. No, we can get those are good beefs. Those are good. Good comments.

1367
02:11:58.64 --> 02:12:04.48
We're going to do some research about Joko, the plaster lantern holder. I'm not sure.

1368
02:12:04.48 --> 02:12:10.000
What do you think? You think it's urban legend or real? Do you think there was a little

1369
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.64
black kid holding the lantern for George Washington that froze to death? Yes or no?

1370
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:24.72
Factor fiction. Yes. Oh, you're going with it. Yeah. Well, put it this way. It might not be exactly that.

1371
02:12:24.72 --> 02:12:28.56
But I think it's like something. But it's not nothing. Put it that way. It's not just,

1372
02:12:28.56 --> 02:12:31.44
oh, someone made up. That's what I think. He's thinking. I don't know. That's a free time.

1373
02:12:31.44 --> 02:12:35.92
You know what? That's a free time. I have actually, I actually know this.

1374
02:12:37.20 --> 02:12:41.52
And I cannot remember. Like I can't remember, it's true. No, because it's so pointy. No, I was like,

1375
02:12:41.52 --> 02:12:45.76
no, I'm like at some point, I, I somebody told me that these little statues were called

1376
02:12:45.76 --> 02:12:49.76
Joko and I was like, oh, I wonder why that is? And I figured out where it came from.

1377
02:12:50.32 --> 02:12:54.24
But I can't remember what the story is. So it could be true. It could be not be true. I don't know yet.

1378
02:12:54.24 --> 02:12:58.24
That's just what I heard. We're going to research it. Yeah. And I would, so I wouldn't be surprised

1379
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:03.84
most likely case scenario in my head right now is that that story overall is true. Maybe some

1380
02:13:03.84 --> 02:13:09.92
details here and there maybe maybe not true. You know, and it all sort of ties in. Yes. So we'll go with it

1381
02:13:09.92 --> 02:13:14.56
in that regard. Oh, yes. Well, that was just one of the Vegas. Yes. It was a very good one.

1382
02:13:14.56 --> 02:13:19.68
But it's not just, it's not just like, oh, here's a statue that means something else.

1383
02:13:19.68 --> 02:13:24.96
You know, some other thing. But this will sound good if we make up this story. You know, based on

1384
02:13:24.96 --> 02:13:31.60
really like some thinly veiled like element that changed what concerns me. I think if it was that

1385
02:13:31.60 --> 02:13:37.12
story that I had read when I researched it in the past, it seems like that would make the connection

1386
02:13:37.12 --> 02:13:42.000
in my neurons and I'd be like, oh, yeah, that's true. Not quite there. You know, feeling not

1387
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.64
not feeling that full. I remember, but I, you know, you're you're subject to your power of your

1388
02:13:48.64 --> 02:13:55.60
memory. Yeah. It was a while ago that I researched that. Yeah. But I do. Yes. Okay. So we got beefs

1389
02:13:55.60 --> 02:14:04.48
settled. We got Dave Burke. Close. Still, you know, we're working through it. Yeah. Dave Burke.

1390
02:14:04.48 --> 02:14:11.28
No, maybe when he's, yeah, because you know how lame I am. Yeah. When you call me and you're like,

1391
02:14:11.28 --> 02:14:17.28
hey, you know, the fights are on, you want to come watch the fights? And you live 17 minutes from me?

1392
02:14:18.16 --> 02:14:26.64
I'm like, oh, I'll buy this. Not watching. Yeah. It's like big thing. Yeah. Yes. So yeah, when you're

1393
02:14:26.64 --> 02:14:34.80
thinking 45. Yeah. It's a strategy. Min, yeah. Halfway to LA, let's face it. Time wise to halfway to LA.

1394
02:14:34.80 --> 02:14:39.20
Absolutely. That's what it's like. Oh, yeah. You know what? It's a really harsh way. If you want to

1395
02:14:39.20 --> 02:14:44.96
think that we really are really like that. To say, oh, you only live halfway to LA. I mean, it's

1396
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:52.16
like, there was an old Saturday night live, skit. That was just California people talking and

1397
02:14:52.16 --> 02:14:57.84
all they were talking about was the traffic. Like, oh, morning, how was the 405 this morning?

1398
02:14:57.84 --> 02:15:01.28
Oh, my God. It was a nightmare. And then the, you know, they just talked that was about the

1399
02:15:01.28 --> 02:15:04.56
video. Yeah. You want the one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was one, I was one, I was one, I was one, I

1400
02:15:04.56 --> 02:15:09.60
won a one. Got jammed up right around the, you know, exit 48. Oh, I'm glad I got it. You know,

1401
02:15:09.60 --> 02:15:16.16
like that. Yeah. And here you are. Halfway to LA. Can't even go with the 50 miles of LA.

1402
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:22.32
Yeah, no, no. Yeah. All right. The struggles real. But hey, like, like, like, you, like, we all

1403
02:15:22.32 --> 02:15:28.48
understand now we're powering through it. Not much talk about Gitu. This podcast. In its

1404
02:15:28.48 --> 02:15:35.36
direct form. In its indirect form. It was everywhere. The spirit of Gitu is everywhere. Yes.

1405
02:15:36.40 --> 02:15:40.88
Was that the last time that we, you came here that we trained? First time. That was the first time.

1406
02:15:40.88 --> 02:15:49.04
Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah, I did. Yeah. It's good. I actually have Gitu, Ligs,

1407
02:15:49.04 --> 02:15:53.68
made. So now that I'm in the my new schedule. I've, I've gone and taken a couple of Filipino

1408
02:15:53.68 --> 02:15:57.76
colleague lessons. I was taking those when I was living in Salt Lake City. So now I'm making

1409
02:15:57.76 --> 02:16:02.80
the transition to finding, you know, the, the scheduling time where I can go and find a good

1410
02:16:02.80 --> 02:16:10.32
place to go and start using my Gitu. I like it. Put like hooks on those Gitu legs. Yeah. Like

1411
02:16:10.32 --> 02:16:17.20
butterfly hook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Well, he's so being on the path

1412
02:16:17.20 --> 02:16:23.36
supporting others and ourselves. We're doing Gitu. Highly recommended required. We'll say

1413
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:32.40
required already. And let's go with it. Yeah. I'm going with it. We're going to get an origin

1414
02:16:32.40 --> 02:16:39.60
G made in America. 100% in America. The cotton that's grown to make the fibers to make the material

1415
02:16:39.60 --> 02:16:43.84
to make the geek. Mm-hmm. It's a weave to make the geek. All that. All that.

1416
02:16:43.84 --> 02:16:48.24
This is different weeks. 100% made in America. No compromise. No compromise. You know how much

1417
02:16:48.24 --> 02:16:54.24
compromise? None zero. Yeah. Yeah. You're a compromise. 100% no compromise. Boom.

1418
02:16:54.24 --> 02:16:59.20
Uh, origin main.com. That's where you can get your geek. Various levels of G's. I don't even know

1419
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:04.32
if their levels will just say options. Is there's not like ones not necessarily better? They're just

1420
02:17:04.32 --> 02:17:09.84
that's all matter of opinion. It's like when you you might like you might like this Cadillac

1421
02:17:10.64 --> 02:17:16.64
or you might like that Cadillac. Cadillac. They're both good cars. Yeah. 100% yes. But you might want

1422
02:17:16.64 --> 02:17:22.96
one for certain reasons. That's a bit of another one. Yeah. You're a lifestyle. Yeah. You're

1423
02:17:22.96 --> 02:17:29.36
so. But you cannot only get G's. They're because unfortunately not everyone does

1424
02:17:29.36 --> 02:17:37.60
train G's to and unfortunately G's are not fully accepted as the garment to be worn in all

1425
02:17:37.60 --> 02:17:41.84
occasions at all times. Yeah. We still have to wear other clothes sometimes. And one of those

1426
02:17:41.84 --> 02:17:47.68
clothes that we sometimes wear most often is something called jeans. Yes, sir. And origin makes

1427
02:17:47.68 --> 02:17:55.52
jeans. American denim. Same deal. Same thing. Same thing. From the time that the Adams

1428
02:17:55.52 --> 02:18:02.08
that formed that girl. Right? That Adams are American. Yeah. I don't know if Adams grow. Well,

1429
02:18:02.08 --> 02:18:06.64
you know, they they've formed a girl. Right? And they have little American flags on those

1430
02:18:06.64 --> 02:18:14.64
evidence. Because that's what we do. You're right. Exactly. And so yes, we're talking about patriotism,

1431
02:18:14.64 --> 02:18:19.12
Rob's a patriot, Rob's serving. Guess what we're doing. What we're doing is trying to bring

1432
02:18:19.12 --> 02:18:25.20
manufacturing back to America. We just hired more people by the way. We got more people

1433
02:18:25.20 --> 02:18:30.56
up at the factory up in Maine because we're making boots now because Americans need boots. They

1434
02:18:30.56 --> 02:18:38.56
need jeans. So yeah, if you want to support the United States of America, if you want to bring us

1435
02:18:38.56 --> 02:18:45.68
back to the leaders of manufacturing, go to originmane.com, get jeans, get keys, get rash guards,

1436
02:18:45.68 --> 02:18:54.08
get t-shirts, get joggers. If you are a jogger person, if you're that is a good, uh, obviously

1437
02:18:54.08 --> 02:19:00.48
very significant important disclaimer. Yes, because I'm not a jogger person. Yeah, you're not a lot

1438
02:19:00.48 --> 02:19:07.76
to our noggers. I look really weird in joggers. Yeah. So don't don't get those if you're me. Yeah.

1439
02:19:07.76 --> 02:19:13.52
But if you're interested in maximum comfort and functionality to list be honest, joggers,

1440
02:19:13.52 --> 02:19:20.32
when you actually jog in them, which I have like twice, you, they function well. They don't fly around.

1441
02:19:20.32 --> 02:19:27.60
Never, ever, ever jog in a pair of pants, ever. Yeah. Yeah. Like no matter what.

1442
02:19:29.04 --> 02:19:34.72
So, you know, not everyone's like that. Okay. You know. But yeah, also supplements, right?

1443
02:19:34.72 --> 02:19:41.84
Talk about support. This is like actual physical anatomical support. Do you know what holds

1444
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:46.48
to see? The whole deal. Building the fibers that support building the atoms. Yeah, we

1445
02:19:46.48 --> 02:19:52.32
add them to that. So we're at a pair of data. Yeah. Or, but well, in this case, it could be not

1446
02:19:52.32 --> 02:20:01.12
a fact. Yeah. Sure. That too. But nonetheless, these are, um, we established the fact that these

1447
02:20:01.12 --> 02:20:04.72
are the most important kind of supplements right there, because they keep you in the game.

1448
02:20:04.72 --> 02:20:07.92
Mm-hmm. Like how we said before, keep you in the game. Yeah. It's not something you're not,

1449
02:20:07.92 --> 02:20:12.08
well, it's like watering the roots rather than watering the leaves. You don't want to leave. No,

1450
02:20:12.08 --> 02:20:16.32
don't want to leave. Unless you do water leaves on it, you don't get any water. The roots. Yes. Exactly.

1451
02:20:16.32 --> 02:20:19.52
Right. So you want those roots to be strong. That's what super,

1452
02:20:19.52 --> 02:20:25.20
Creole oil. Joint warfare. That's what these things do. You want to the roots.

1453
02:20:25.20 --> 02:20:29.68
You grow higher. Also, we got discipline. Yes, sir. Which Dave Burke is a big supporter of.

1454
02:20:30.24 --> 02:20:37.52
He takes discipline. Go capsules. You know, get his brains right. But guess what? You get

1455
02:20:37.52 --> 02:20:42.72
this one in the power out. By the way, Andy Burke has been tripling up his scoops in our

1456
02:20:42.72 --> 02:20:49.84
world with him last night. Again, luckily, that one was non-video. That video actually,

1457
02:20:50.56 --> 02:20:53.68
the one of you in Andy, really, who's like just for like three minutes. What was that like the

1458
02:20:53.68 --> 02:20:59.04
end of the round or something? Yeah. Yeah. Was whatever was left on the round? Yeah. That, that was

1459
02:20:59.04 --> 02:21:06.24
it actually an uncanny, uncannily accurate depiction of rolling with you. It just felt like super heavy.

1460
02:21:06.24 --> 02:21:11.28
And that's that's spazzy. Yeah. You know, just real heavy and just like heavy. Look, we should read the

1461
02:21:11.28 --> 02:21:15.60
comments. We should do a podcast where we just read comments. I know we've talked about that. But that

1462
02:21:15.60 --> 02:21:21.36
has to funny comments. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you talked about political haters. There were some.

1463
02:21:21.36 --> 02:21:25.60
So really funny. They were hating on me. They're hating on Andy. They were hating on

1464
02:21:25.60 --> 02:21:30.48
you. Yeah, too. I mean, most people are super cool. But the funny ones, the ones that would be worse,

1465
02:21:30.48 --> 02:21:35.04
like, comically reading were ones that, you know, people that were just talking smack.

1466
02:21:35.04 --> 02:21:40.08
Yeah. That's how man. Yeah. That's how. Marshall largest is one of those trigger events. You

1467
02:21:40.08 --> 02:21:46.88
know, like, Marshall art diet, raising kids, religions, all at least sleep apparently. Yeah. Like how much

1468
02:21:46.88 --> 02:21:52.56
you do? You're going to actually die. Oh, yeah. It's just in sleep. See if you can speak enough.

1469
02:21:52.56 --> 02:21:58.24
Speaking of discipline, we got new discipline. It's in a can. It's called discipline go. It is

1470
02:21:58.24 --> 02:22:06.56
what I'm going to call clean energy. You know, you got those energy that's that's not clean.

1471
02:22:06.56 --> 02:22:13.76
Oh, yeah. 30 energy. It's called drinks with a bunch of sugar in them and other chemicals.

1472
02:22:13.76 --> 02:22:19.28
This drink has not that in it. Yeah. It's like you, it's clean. And like you can't even call it

1473
02:22:19.28 --> 02:22:24.48
energy. Let me, let me read you the ingredient list. Filtered carbonated water,

1474
02:22:24.48 --> 02:22:33.28
natural flavor, citric acid, monk fruit. Boom. Did you hear that? That's clean. That is it.

1475
02:22:33.28 --> 02:22:38.16
Clean as you can make a drink. And you know why? You know what's revolutionary? What's revolutionary?

1476
02:22:38.16 --> 02:22:42.96
The way we're able to do that is because we are pasteurizing this. Like what they do with milk.

1477
02:22:42.96 --> 02:22:46.64
We are pasteurizing it. We're keeping it to that certain level, killing all the bacteria,

1478
02:22:46.64 --> 02:22:50.96
whatever that's in there. So we can stay on the shelf without putting a bunch of chemicals,

1479
02:22:50.96 --> 02:22:58.16
which whatever else does. So discipline go. We got two flavors right now. We got more common.

1480
02:22:58.16 --> 02:23:02.56
And they're all good. This is my mother. The other one is tropic thunder. Oh, dang.

1481
02:23:02.56 --> 02:23:06.16
I don't think that. And I'll tell you, it's called tropic thunder. And sometimes you know,

1482
02:23:06.16 --> 02:23:10.16
oh, that's cool name, whatever. It was either that or I had to call it what it is. And you

1483
02:23:10.16 --> 02:23:15.44
want to know what it is. Yeah. Pina colance, Pina colance. Let's face it. Yeah, that doesn't match.

1484
02:23:15.44 --> 02:23:20.32
I can't come out with something called Pina colance. No, no. Not happens. So we call the

1485
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:26.56
tropic thunder. So yeah, you can get that discipline go. Cance all that stuff from origin main.com.

1486
02:23:27.28 --> 02:23:32.32
So milk protein. Yes. Dissert in the or protein form of the dessert. And this work in

1487
02:23:32.32 --> 02:23:36.56
milk protein in the form of dessert for your kid. And a snack. It's like a sweet snack. We'll say

1488
02:23:36.96 --> 02:23:42.56
for the kids, right? Yeah. It's actually an amazing thing. And then what are you? What are you drinking today?

1489
02:23:42.56 --> 02:23:51.28
Oh, my, my little thing now. Yeah. I got some chocolate. And I have never felt more

1490
02:23:53.04 --> 02:23:58.08
mental faculties or just fire. Fire on the other. And you're a tea drinker because your

1491
02:23:58.08 --> 02:24:04.000
wife's from England. Big tea drinker. I'm actually trying to create my own drink. You know,

1492
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.84
how Arnold Palmer. Yeah, you're fan of the all in our Paul. You like to put a little shot of

1493
02:24:07.84 --> 02:24:13.84
lemon. Let me tell you what. I see. We have a little flavor coming out for powdered discipline

1494
02:24:13.84 --> 02:24:19.28
and a flavor coming out for discipline go in the can. And the name of the flavor is

1495
02:24:20.40 --> 02:24:29.12
jaccopommer. And I'm not even kidding. And I'll tell you what, it is the one that both of them.

1496
02:24:29.12 --> 02:24:34.72
They are you like, you like Arnold Palmer's. Yeah. So if you picture the best Arnold Palmer that you

1497
02:24:34.72 --> 02:24:42.08
ever had, that's how good these are. I was like, when I went through whatever eight samples. And

1498
02:24:42.08 --> 02:24:46.96
like, no, no more this more tea less that more. And finally got the when we when I got the good one,

1499
02:24:46.96 --> 02:24:54.80
when I got the final one, I told be little. I'm like, hey, go manufacturer, both these things right now.

1500
02:24:54.80 --> 02:24:58.08
I want this stuff tomorrow. And he's like, it's going to be six weeks a week. Bro,

1501
02:24:58.08 --> 02:25:06.96
I said me more samples. All right, so yes. I'm trying to get my own drink made or not made, but

1502
02:25:06.96 --> 02:25:11.68
I'm going to make it a thing. You know how when the first time I was here, we went and we had ice

1503
02:25:11.68 --> 02:25:17.04
teas and I put a little half an half in there. Little hit or yeah. Yeah. So I kind of got that from

1504
02:25:17.04 --> 02:25:21.92
learning how to drink tea from Pam. So you see, introduced me to the way that English people

1505
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:27.44
drink tea. They put milk in there. So I came back. I'm American. We like to do the ice tea.

1506
02:25:27.44 --> 02:25:31.52
And I thought I'm thinking outside the box. I'm outside the box. The thing hurts. So I was like,

1507
02:25:31.52 --> 02:25:36.16
you know what? I'm going to have an iced tea and bring a little half in half, too. Poor that in there.

1508
02:25:36.16 --> 02:25:41.76
Delicious. Most people think, little gross. But what I'm going to start doing now, I'm going to start saying,

1509
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:48.000
I'll have a Rob Jones and the white or be like, oh, you know, I see with half of that. I see what will happen

1510
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:53.68
in there. I would have been way more supportive of this. If you would have said, oh, so I'm going to

1511
02:25:53.68 --> 02:25:58.32
bring it back a little bit. So I put milk in there vanilla milk because that's face it. That's an option.

1512
02:25:59.12 --> 02:26:04.64
That's an option. I have tried that vanilla. I have tried milk. I've tried protein powders like

1513
02:26:04.64 --> 02:26:10.16
a regular tea. You haven't tried any. Yeah, that's right. That's true. Yeah, it's right. But now you and I have

1514
02:26:12.16 --> 02:26:16.80
at this juncture, it wouldn't be that wise to do the whole thing yet because half and half is going

1515
02:26:16.80 --> 02:26:22.64
to be a little bit more widespread at this point. Yeah. He's trying to step at the role is establishing

1516
02:26:22.64 --> 02:26:28.40
the rob Jones. Yeah. Like the half and half of my own. That's what everybody knows about. Yeah. So

1517
02:26:28.40 --> 02:26:36.88
in a way is kind of up to you, to us, to bolster the availability of milk in a general way.

1518
02:26:36.88 --> 02:26:42.96
To make the milk Jones. Oh, yeah. That's the next level one. Hey, that's a good. Yeah,

1519
02:26:42.96 --> 02:26:48.88
this you know the discipline, the Arnold Palmer flavor, which is called jaccopommer.

1520
02:26:48.88 --> 02:26:59.44
It's so good. It's ridiculous. All right. So that's that. All jaccopoite all mook blah blah blah. Check.

1521
02:26:59.44 --> 02:27:04.88
Origin main.com. Boom. Get it. Yeah. Whatever you need, whatever you like. Also,

1522
02:27:04.88 --> 02:27:10.48
jaccopo has a store. It's called jaccopo store. Yep. So online store. Yeah. If you want to represent

1523
02:27:10.48 --> 02:27:17.20
you go jaccopostore.com, as we can get your deaf course shirts. Come on, let's face it. When you see someone

1524
02:27:17.20 --> 02:27:24.48
representing that. It's good. But yeah, you can get this when he goes free. It's on T-shirt.

1525
02:27:24.48 --> 02:27:27.92
It's hoodies. Lightweight and heavyweight hoodies. But I don't know.

1526
02:27:28.96 --> 02:27:36.000
Trucker hat or Flex fit rub Jones. What is a Flex fit? It's the one that fits in Flex. Oh,

1527
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.12
like the fitted caps. Yeah. Well, no, no, they're fitted. But they they have a little

1528
02:27:41.12 --> 02:27:48.08
asses stretch in there. So you know, yeah. Trucker's bro. Yeah. I have to go to truckers.

1529
02:27:48.08 --> 02:27:54.16
But not by a white margin, apparently. Well, you know, there's certain instances where the

1530
02:27:54.16 --> 02:27:58.80
the Flex might be better. Right. You're out. You're thinking about it. Let's do a work it now.

1531
02:27:58.80 --> 02:28:03.60
If you're outside, you're going to be sweating a lot. I don't know. But we're not against Flex fit.

1532
02:28:03.60 --> 02:28:08.72
I like both. Yeah. But if I had to choose one. That was a very political answer.

1533
02:28:08.72 --> 02:28:13.04
I'm just kidding. I'm just a conversation. I didn't take one. But here's the thing.

1534
02:28:13.04 --> 02:28:16.08
The rest of my life I go trucker. There we go. Thank you. Okay. I'm afraid.

1535
02:28:16.08 --> 02:28:21.36
Yeah. I don't wear hats. I don't even. I'm just waiting in this debate broke.

1536
02:28:21.36 --> 02:28:27.52
Because when I used to wear hats. What made you stop? I don't know. I think he was like

1537
02:28:27.52 --> 02:28:32.48
your head's in the sun. Yes. And you don't wear hats. I'm sorry. Don't.

1538
02:28:32.48 --> 02:28:36.48
I guess it should because fashion sense. No. No. Because lack of hat.

1539
02:28:36.48 --> 02:28:45.60
Lack of preparation for the hat. It's a scenario. I think about it. I have a hat with me everywhere I go.

1540
02:28:45.60 --> 02:28:52.08
Yeah. I don't wear it all the time because I'm not one of those guys. What guys?

1541
02:28:52.08 --> 02:28:58.96
Guys who have to wear it. I don't think about it. If my head isn't hot, I don't think about it for whatever reason.

1542
02:28:58.96 --> 02:29:04.16
Check. But nonetheless. Okay. We got both. That's the good news, Rob Jones. We have both.

1543
02:29:04.16 --> 02:29:08.000
Okay. Let's see. You get a good thing here on the stage. Yes, sir. Yep. You're good.

1544
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:14.16
This is the one. You are 100% wrong. And I am 100% right. Oh, that's a better. God.

1545
02:29:15.04 --> 02:29:20.24
And if you don't like truckers hat, you're evil. Yes. It's not. You are not.

1546
02:29:20.24 --> 02:29:27.52
Amen. You're a communist. Jockelstore.com. Yes. For you communist or otherwise, you know,

1547
02:29:27.52 --> 02:29:32.64
whatever. No, no, no communist. No communist allowed. No. Yeah, but communist won't represent like that anyway.

1548
02:29:32.64 --> 02:29:35.92
See, I'm saying, so they're just going to do your gun on what he called. They're going to scroll. Yeah.

1549
02:29:35.92 --> 02:29:40.40
That's cool. Don't forget to subscribe to this podcast, which apparently you haven't done yet.

1550
02:29:40.40 --> 02:29:43.44
According to your echoed Charles, you've listened to 100.

1551
02:29:44.48 --> 02:29:49.76
And they're all said that. You would have a podcast. And you didn't subscribe according to echoed

1552
02:29:49.76 --> 02:29:56.24
Charles. So he says, you should subscribe. If you want. If you want them there. So it's like,

1553
02:29:56.24 --> 02:30:02.32
so that means you don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. Yeah. You don't have to. It's all optional. Really at the end of the day.

1554
02:30:02.32 --> 02:30:08.40
Also, where he kid bought cast, subscribe to that one. Mm-hmm. My daughter has a question for Uncle Jake,

1555
02:30:08.40 --> 02:30:14.000
by the way. There's a whole last night that Uncle Jake recommended strongly that she just

1556
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.64
call him on FaceTime or whatever, since she has the direct glance. She felt real good. I sat her video

1557
02:30:18.64 --> 02:30:24.40
today, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. She sent me a video first. Okay. From Sarah Charles's. Okay, cool.

1558
02:30:24.40 --> 02:30:30.56
So she's bringing away the warrior kid to school. Yeah. Show and tell. Yes. She's nice. She sent me a little video.

1559
02:30:30.56 --> 02:30:35.76
I'm bringing this book into school. Thank you. Yeah. And then she was telling me a little bit about the book.

1560
02:30:35.76 --> 02:30:38.48
And then I said, hey, because she said, she said, there's even a picture of you on the back.

1561
02:30:39.28 --> 02:30:44.96
And I informed her that her dad took that picture. Echo Charles. That's really the kind of meat of that book.

1562
02:30:44.96 --> 02:30:50.000
Is that that photograph that you took? That's what I thought a lot of people. And I guess there's some cool lessons or whatever.

1563
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.32
But yes, you are right. That picture. Yeah. Warrior Kid podcast. We are in the process of recording

1570
02:31:30.24 --> 02:31:33.84
Because you written some cool videos up there. That's another way to see what you put.

1571
02:31:33.84 --> 02:31:38.88
Or like what kind of videos so far. Only one of those no exposure. No exposure. No

1572
02:31:38.88 --> 02:31:41.92
exposure. Don't worry. We'll talk about that. Well, there is a real life explosion.

1573
02:31:41.92 --> 02:31:47.92
You do have a real life. You have the actual explosion that you set off? No, no, no. I was going to say,

1574
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:51.92
well, we set it up and it was so controlled that there was a control button. I stopped on

1575
02:31:51.92 --> 02:31:55.92
really. Yeah. People really, people really, they're cameras out during those shows.

1576
02:31:55.92 --> 02:32:00.40
Which weird though. There's people that have footage of everything. Like some of the

1577
02:32:00.40 --> 02:32:04.64
guys put cameras on the rifle. Yeah, cameras on the rifles on their helmet. There's videos of

1578
02:32:04.64 --> 02:32:13.60
everything out. When we had Ron Scher on here who they like assaulted this hill and

1579
02:32:13.60 --> 02:32:18.80
he's a metal of honor recipient, that almost the whole thing is on video. It's on YouTube.

1580
02:32:18.80 --> 02:32:24.16
You can watch it. It's like, and you watch it. And as bad as it sounds when you read about it,

1581
02:32:24.16 --> 02:32:27.52
as bad as the situation sounds when you read about it, you're like, I'm thinking myself, man,

1582
02:32:27.52 --> 02:32:34.16
this sounds absolutely horrible. You watch the video and you go, oh my god. I mean, I was laughing

1583
02:32:34.16 --> 02:32:39.60
about it with them. Because the guys get out in the valley, it's not even a valley. It's just,

1584
02:32:40.32 --> 02:32:47.28
it's a ravine. No, it's a canyon. They get out at the bottom of the canyon and assault

1585
02:32:47.28 --> 02:32:56.56
up a hill, a freaking giant reinforced castle. It's like out of a prehist or a medieval movie.

1586
02:32:56.56 --> 02:33:00.64
And that's what they did. And they didn't make it all the way up because it was an impossible task.

1587
02:33:00.64 --> 02:33:04.16
But yeah, so there is a video. That's why when you said, oh, there's exposure. And I remember

1588
02:33:04.16 --> 02:33:09.36
to watch that video yesterday. But yeah, not the exposure. Yeah, not the the exposure. No. But

1589
02:33:09.36 --> 02:33:13.92
what, um, as far as like videos or whatever, like I'm going to subscribe, smash the like button,

1590
02:33:13.92 --> 02:33:18.88
all that stuff. What, uh, what am I going to be watching? Um, here you're going to be watching stuff

1591
02:33:18.88 --> 02:33:24.08
like that. You're going to, mostly the videos that we're going to be doing is just getting people to

1592
02:33:24.08 --> 02:33:28.40
know who I am, what I'm about. So there might be some personal stuff on there where I'm going

1593
02:33:28.40 --> 02:33:33.12
around the district and kind of talking about, oh, you know, this is where I went to elementary school.

1594
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.36
This is where I used to go hiking on the Appalachian Trail, you know, stuff like that. So just

1595
02:33:37.36 --> 02:33:42.96
getting people to know what I'm all about as a person. So yeah, there's going to be a lot of that

1596
02:33:42.96 --> 02:33:48.88
stuff. If you need footage from the podcast, you could take little clips of your statements and

1597
02:33:48.88 --> 02:33:54.32
stuff, let echo know. You know, and then you could, you could edit some of those. Yeah, well, yeah,

1598
02:33:54.32 --> 02:33:59.60
stuff like that. But yes, we do have our YouTube channel, talk podcast YouTube channel. It

1599
02:33:59.60 --> 02:34:04.40
interested in what Rob Jones looks like if you don't know already, which I think is going to be

1600
02:34:04.40 --> 02:34:10.40
sorely disappointed if you want to know. Man, and then there's psychological warfare. It's a bunch of

1601
02:34:10.40 --> 02:34:16.48
me in little short recordings about how the decision that you're about to make, which is the wrong

1602
02:34:16.48 --> 02:34:20.64
decision that you know, and you need a little something to get you to make the right decision

1603
02:34:20.64 --> 02:34:29.52
psychological warfare will get it done for you, just press play on your smartphone device device

1604
02:34:30.40 --> 02:34:36.24
and you will literally make the right decision. Yeah, what that does really, and I know literally

1605
02:34:36.24 --> 02:34:42.08
is overused, but I'm saying you will for really literally make the right decision. It makes sense

1606
02:34:42.08 --> 02:34:48.24
because it's you talking about them almost making the short term thing that we covered on

1607
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:54.80
machete season. When the first thing the when a revolution happens, they take over the radio stations

1608
02:34:54.80 --> 02:35:00.08
because they want to get right into the thoughts of the people. Right? No, you don't have to read it.

1609
02:35:00.08 --> 02:35:04.48
You don't have to interpret anything. It's going into your brain. It's words. That's a psychological

1610
02:35:04.48 --> 02:35:08.48
warfare. It's going to write into your brain. Yeah, but your words are saying, hey, right now you're

1611
02:35:08.48 --> 02:35:14.16
about to make a short term play. Let's just shuffle that over to the long term. That's all we're

1612
02:35:14.16 --> 02:35:17.20
going to do. We're going to make that decision. But instead of short term, we're going to go long

1613
02:35:17.20 --> 02:35:20.32
term. That's all we're going to do right now. And then you go, oh, shit. And well, that's what we're going

1614
02:35:20.32 --> 02:35:26.32
to do. And then you go do it. That's what it does. Yeah. Effectively, by the way. Yeah, yeah, so you can do that.

1615
02:35:26.32 --> 02:35:31.28
You can put a cure of the dot. You're ever heard a cure of the dawn. A cure of the dawn, yeah.

1616
02:35:31.28 --> 02:35:36.96
Yeah, yeah. Because you could just listen to a cure of the dawn tracks. Sure. Eight minute tracks.

1617
02:35:36.96 --> 02:35:44.32
What's a music in the background? What did it just be talking? Yes. Is that weird? No, people know that.

1618
02:35:44.32 --> 02:35:49.68
Yeah, I dig it. I like music in the back of talking. I like that. Oh, yeah. Well, that's what the

1619
02:35:49.68 --> 02:35:55.92
good video is. And people love that. It's all new. Yeah. Yeah. True. Good music there. A lot of people think

1620
02:35:55.92 --> 02:36:00.000
it's maybe what's get said. But then so most people think it's just a video. That's that made

1621
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.40
that video cool. That's where you've told me a lot. Yeah, I'm one of those people. But you know,

02:37:38.48 --> 02:37:44.08
forget about that can stuff. You seem saying and it's kind of obvious like being like afraid of something

1639
02:37:44.08 --> 02:37:49.36
then you say then somebody will be like, hey, what are you really afraid of the thing about what I'm

1640
02:37:49.36 --> 02:37:56.80
really afraid of just feels scary. Whatever we had a little incident at the Willink Household two days ago.

1641
02:37:57.76 --> 02:38:03.76
It was time to go for an ocean swim with my youngest daughter. There was a tied scenario that was

1642
02:38:03.76 --> 02:38:12.24
making it the only water entry was a little cliff jump. And my daughter, my daughter,

1643
02:38:13.20 --> 02:38:18.56
was hesitant at the moment of truth. How high? Not high at all depends on where the waves were at

1644
02:38:18.56 --> 02:38:23.28
and you had to time it well. And there's a lot of, let's say, white water activity in the zone,

1645
02:38:23.28 --> 02:38:26.80
which raised the fear of love. Yes. In fact, I asked her, what are you afraid of? And she's like,

1646
02:38:26.80 --> 02:38:31.68
it looks like it's crazy. Yeah, but we had a little talk and then I threw it in.

1647
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:39.20
I did. I got to admit, you know, but was it like the kind of surprise throw you in or it's like,

1648
02:38:39.20 --> 02:38:42.96
hey, don't worry. You have to make the decision. I gave her, I gave her time to think about it. But

1649
02:38:42.96 --> 02:38:48.08
actually part of the reason that I gave her time to think about it was I wanted her to experience

1650
02:38:48.08 --> 02:38:51.44
the fear for a longer amount of time, right? Not just like, no, we got to do it right now. Let's go.

1651
02:38:51.44 --> 02:38:55.36
I wanted her to stand there and think about it because that's actually the worst part. Yes. And so then

1652
02:38:55.36 --> 02:38:59.52
finally, I said, Liz and I said, she's like, I really don't want to. It really looks, it looks like

1653
02:38:59.52 --> 02:39:02.32
it could be really dangerous. It looks like I'm going to get sucked in those rocks and I said,

1654
02:39:02.32 --> 02:39:06.96
you're not going to get sucked in the rocks. You're going to be fine. And just so you know,

1655
02:39:08.08 --> 02:39:13.28
you are going to do this. So we can wait as long as you want, but this is happening. And when my

1656
02:39:13.28 --> 02:39:20.88
kids know me, like when I say that, it's not there's no like this, it's going to happen. And so I said that to her

1657
02:39:20.88 --> 02:39:26.80
and she kind of got the defeated look on her face because she knew it was going to happen. And the

1658
02:39:26.80 --> 02:39:33.04
the because her tears were like up a little bit. They didn't come out, but I could see it. And my

1659
02:39:33.04 --> 02:39:38.56
youngest daughter, she got these big, big blue eyes and she's real good with that whole play.

1660
02:39:38.56 --> 02:39:46.000
Oh, yeah, she's good. She, my wife, she would break my wife down like a child. I'm going to just snap her

1661
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.16
more out. No chance. No chance. No chance. No chance. When those, she got those big eyes that it can

1662
02:39:52.16 --> 02:39:58.40
it can hold the tear. It can just hold it there. Which is even worse right now. Yes, they're big.

1663
02:39:58.40 --> 02:40:01.12
And so she started doing that with me. Guess what? I don't play that.

1664
02:40:02.16 --> 02:40:07.76
Those tears in the industry, we call those tears falling upon a heart of stone. Yes, that's

1665
02:40:07.76 --> 02:40:12.64
what happened. So she started to get work in that angle. I said, don't even, don't work that

1666
02:40:12.64 --> 02:40:19.28
angle. It's happening. We're going off this cliff. So we get so finally, she's, she looks defeated.

1667
02:40:19.28 --> 02:40:23.84
She knows it's happening. She walks the edge and I said, okay, and it was kind of a tight little

1668
02:40:23.84 --> 02:40:28.48
promenadeary to try and jump off just a little thing jutting out. It's actually not big enough for

1669
02:40:28.48 --> 02:40:34.08
two people. So I kind of put her a little bit in front of me. And then I said, okay, we're going to go on

1670
02:40:34.08 --> 02:40:37.84
three and I knew I couldn't actually go with her because there's rocks down there. You got to watch

1671
02:40:37.84 --> 02:40:42.88
out for so that I just kind of, I go, okay, one, two scooped up grab her through.

1672
02:40:47.36 --> 02:40:53.92
You laughed like that. She was going down. You know, the best thing is she hit the water.

1673
02:40:53.92 --> 02:40:59.04
She started swimming away from the rocks so she could be safe. And then I got a watchter and then

1674
02:40:59.04 --> 02:41:02.64
then she looked up and she had a big smile on her face. She got to her. It's fun. Yeah, she's

1675
02:41:02.64 --> 02:41:07.44
over and then we swam, you know, whatever to back all around the point to the, to the, to the beach.

1676
02:41:07.44 --> 02:41:11.60
Well, that's good though. And I told her, I said, look, that's what that was. That was

1677
02:41:11.60 --> 02:41:15.60
Mike and the dragons. That was, that was, you stood up and faced your fears. That was jumping off

1678
02:41:15.60 --> 02:41:19.60
the bridge from Mark where the warrior kid you just did it. That's what it's about. But in

1679
02:41:20.64 --> 02:41:25.36
when you look at a big picture, like that's a specific scenario where you knew her like capability

1680
02:41:25.36 --> 02:41:29.84
and limitations or whatever because sometimes like you get someone maybe not comfortable in the water

1681
02:41:29.84 --> 02:41:33.36
or something like this. Oh, yeah, that's when you throw them in. Oh, yeah, they're not looking

1682
02:41:33.36 --> 02:41:38.08
back smiling. They are traumatized. And now they can't go in the water at all anymore. You know,

1683
02:41:38.08 --> 02:41:45.36
yeah, I kind of did that with one of my friends kids. No, like the dad is a good friend of mine.

1684
02:41:45.36 --> 02:41:48.80
He was on the ployment. You're not invited to my house. You know, he was on the ployment. Check it out.

1685
02:41:48.80 --> 02:41:53.28
He was on the ployment. And so while he's on the ployment, who guess who's responsible for like making

1686
02:41:53.28 --> 02:41:58.16
sure that the sun is kind of like, you know, legit. It's me. And I didn't get to see him that much because

1687
02:41:58.16 --> 02:42:02.88
I was like working and deploying it all that stuff. So I finally saw him at the beach and I was like,

1688
02:42:02.88 --> 02:42:05.68
cool, we're going in the water. And he's like, I don't really want to go in there. I was like, oh,

1689
02:42:05.68 --> 02:42:13.28
what? And I just picked him up and I hooked him out in the surf zone. He wasn't happy. The mama's crying.

1690
02:42:13.28 --> 02:42:17.20
And I thought she was a cry. And when she definitely was like, you know, how you know,

1691
02:42:17.20 --> 02:42:24.32
sometimes things are unfolding and you can tell people they're just doing their best just to like

1692
02:42:24.32 --> 02:42:28.80
detach from it. Yes. She was in that mood. She's a good friend of mine. She was kind of like,

1693
02:42:28.80 --> 02:42:36.000
look, I know this guy's probably this is probably not right. But he handled or was he like,

1694
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.40
I don't know if I can even hang with chocolate anymore. It was probably not the best.

1695
02:42:40.40 --> 02:42:46.48
Yeah. Yeah. It was probably not the best move on my part. I also did that one time with a real little kid

1696
02:42:46.48 --> 02:42:52.80
where I picked this little kid up. And I said, you know, something was a boy, right? And I said something

1697
02:42:52.80 --> 02:42:56.56
like, oh, there he is. And it's really, oh, yeah. It's like, oh, it's like, oh, it's in acute. I was like, yeah.

1698
02:42:56.56 --> 02:42:59.84
And he needs to get used to, you know, things like machine gun fire. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1699
02:42:59.84 --> 02:43:04.80
like really loud. And the kids started crying because this kid was like six months old or maybe even a little bit

1700
02:43:04.80 --> 02:43:12.80
younger. Six months. So baby. Yeah. So yeah. So be careful that. Well, hey, so hi, so you

1701
02:43:12.80 --> 02:43:17.60
essentially, and I'm trying to gather like info, so I can actually use in the real work. So you kind of,

1702
02:43:17.60 --> 02:43:25.60
you're like on the on the what he call it on the borderline of two rough. Right. Yes. No, and I'm better now.

1703
02:43:25.60 --> 02:43:32.88
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not to just totally go into like one more little situation. I was

1704
02:43:32.88 --> 02:43:39.76
surfing with my little daughter, same one, right? And it was, we were done. And there's a cliff

1705
02:43:39.76 --> 02:43:44.000
you got to climb up to get out. We're carrying your board. It's a cliff. It's a trail. It's a whole nine yards.

1706
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:51.28
And so what I did was, she's 10 years old. So I, and it's can be hard. And there's a little parts

1707
02:43:51.28 --> 02:43:56.56
where you could possibly fall off, right? Probably not though. Most likely you're going to be good. If you

1708
02:43:57.52 --> 02:44:02.000
think about what you're doing. So I get done and I got my board. So I run up to the top of

1709
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.64
cliff's carrying my board. I put it down and I turned around so I can go help her carry her board for

1710
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:13.12
her. Yeah. And I fought to myself if this was my son when my son was that age, there was zero

1711
02:44:13.12 --> 02:44:21.12
chance of me going down and helping him. Zero. You figured out kid. And so I stood there at the top

1712
02:44:21.12 --> 02:44:26.40
and I just watched her and she made it up and when she got to the top, I said, you know, I was going

1713
02:44:26.40 --> 02:44:30.96
to come help you. I said, but if that was your brother, there's no way I would have ever helped him.

1714
02:44:31.52 --> 02:44:36.000
And I don't, I would rather have you do it for yourself. What do you want me to do? Do you want

1715
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.56
me to give you special treatment? Or do you want to be strong? And she's like, I want to be strong.

1716
02:44:40.56 --> 02:44:48.08
And I said, cool, we're good. So there you go. You can have a tendency to lean especially when you

1717
02:44:48.08 --> 02:44:52.48
you got your baby kid, right? The youngest kid, especially when they can make those tears think

1718
02:44:52.48 --> 02:44:58.48
that big giant tears sitting on the edge of the eyeballs. That's it. But that's how you do run

1719
02:44:58.48 --> 02:45:03.20
that risk though of going like touch, you know, sticking one toe over the board. You can definitely

1720
02:45:03.20 --> 02:45:06.48
make it more kid-cross. You can traumatize the kid. You can make them hate the water. There's

1721
02:45:06.48 --> 02:45:10.32
a lot of things you can do. So you got to be careful. You got to lean towards and actually the best

1722
02:45:10.32 --> 02:45:14.56
policy is you lean towards whatever you do with them builds their confidence doesn't break it.

1723
02:45:14.56 --> 02:45:18.96
That's the, that's the line. You say, oh, if I throw them in the water and they get, they get

1724
02:45:18.96 --> 02:45:22.88
done with it in the car. I actually did it. That builds their confidence cool. If you throw them in the

1725
02:45:22.88 --> 02:45:27.52
water and now it freaks them out and you broke their confidence, that's bad. So the line that you

1726
02:45:27.52 --> 02:45:30.88
should be going for is everything that you're doing with your kids builds their confidence until

1727
02:45:30.88 --> 02:45:34.72
they become overconfident. And then we have to start putting them in check. That's when you take them

1728
02:45:34.72 --> 02:45:42.000
for the pool competency. All right. Yeah, I did that with my son. I did that with my son. Like,

1729
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.16
oh, you're good. Okay, cool. I tied his feet, tied his feet together, tied his hands behind his back.

1730
02:45:46.16 --> 02:45:51.20
And I had him do, uh, we call it drown proofing. And the first time he did it, he did not pass.

1731
02:45:51.20 --> 02:45:53.52
What age is this? I don't know, he's probably like seven.

1732
02:45:54.24 --> 02:45:58.64
Oh, damn. All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's for seven. He's good now. But, you know,

1733
02:45:58.64 --> 02:46:03.68
the first time I had to, I had to go for the right little rescue. Right. And that's that thing that you say,

1734
02:46:03.68 --> 02:46:07.68
too, right, where you're like, hey, put them in the right, if they're like in a leadership situation at

1735
02:46:07.68 --> 02:46:11.12
work or whatever, right, like you're like, hey, if they're overconfident, give them something just

1736
02:46:11.12 --> 02:46:15.92
beyond their level. And they're underconfident, not going to give them something. That's what this is when

1737
02:46:15.92 --> 02:46:20.72
my son was like starting to get into big waves. And you know, you can start if you start getting

1738
02:46:20.72 --> 02:46:26.24
overconfident with the ocean, the ocean's going to put in the check. So you don't want to let that happen.

1739
02:46:26.24 --> 02:46:30.72
All right, back to what we're doing here. Discipline goes freedom field manual. That's available as well.

1740
02:46:30.72 --> 02:46:36.56
It's how you stay on the path as an adult or as a kid, not the kids are reading that book as well.

1741
02:46:37.52 --> 02:46:43.04
The audio version is on iTunes Amazon, the music and Google Play as an MP3 album with tracks.

1742
02:46:44.08 --> 02:46:46.72
And then finally, we got extreme ownership in the economy of leadership.

1743
02:46:47.84 --> 02:46:54.96
Books about leadership that we experienced in combat. That Rob Jones is going to bring those principles

1744
02:46:54.96 --> 02:47:04.40
to the government, which is outstanding. How many tweets do I get in the day that says about

1745
02:47:04.40 --> 02:47:08.48
whatever politician on either side that says this guy could use your book, these people can

1746
02:47:08.48 --> 02:47:13.36
use your book. They said all the time, send them to Congress. They say, I would say, well, send them.

1747
02:47:13.36 --> 02:47:18.40
Give me an address. Excellent. That's our leadership consultancy. We saw problems through leadership.

1748
02:47:18.40 --> 02:47:25.60
Go to echelonfront.com for details. We got EF online, which is leadership training that you can do

1749
02:47:27.04 --> 02:47:34.96
virtually. It's interactive. There's choose your own adventures decision-making drills in there.

1750
02:47:34.96 --> 02:47:41.76
Four leaders go to EF online.com to check that out. We got the master. The next one is in Sydney.

1751
02:47:41.76 --> 02:47:48.40
Sydney, December 4th and 5th, we will be there. Who knows when we'll be back in Australia.

1752
02:47:48.40 --> 02:47:56.24
In America, the 20-20 dates will be out soon. So go to extremotorship.com to pay attention to that.

1753
02:47:56.24 --> 02:48:00.96
And don't forget that all masters have sold out. And all masters will sell out.

1754
02:48:02.08 --> 02:48:09.28
So we actually rearrange the room in Denver because it sold out so fast. We like needed. We bought

1755
02:48:09.28 --> 02:48:15.28
more space and made got more seats. But we can't do that every time we max it out. So if you want to come

1756
02:48:16.88 --> 02:48:21.68
good extremotorship.com and then EF Overwatch where we are taking proven leaders. I've got some

1757
02:48:21.68 --> 02:48:27.12
really good talking to Mike Surreli. We got some candidates now that we're not candidates, but we got

1758
02:48:27.12 --> 02:48:32.80
some people that were hired. And that it'll just give the best experience. But we're getting the

1759
02:48:32.80 --> 02:48:38.96
best referrals and feedback on the folks that we're placing. These are special operations in combat,

1760
02:48:38.96 --> 02:48:44.24
aviation leaders that are coming off the battlefield and going into civilian companies and

1761
02:48:45.04 --> 02:48:47.28
helping them with their leadership and helping them win.

1762
02:48:49.20 --> 02:48:54.72
Communication. It's important. We talked about that a decent amount today. If you want to communicate

1763
02:48:54.72 --> 02:49:01.60
with us, then you can find us on the inner webs, on Twitter, Instagram, and on Diva, Fruz, and Book.

1764
02:49:01.60 --> 02:49:08.96
Echoes at Echo Charles. I am at jockwillink. Rob Jones. Okay. So Rob Jones for Congress.com.

1765
02:49:08.96 --> 02:49:17.04
Yep. Facebook is at Rob Jones for Congress. Twitter is at Rob Jones VA. Right. As in Virginia.

1766
02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:26.56
Right. Correct. It was OPPVA in Ramadi. And it was OPPVA. It was Virginia.

1767
02:49:26.56 --> 02:49:32.96
Okay. But you could have thought it was the VA. Yeah. Exactly. I wanted to make it Rob Jones

1768
02:49:32.96 --> 02:49:37.76
for Congress, but they don't allow it to be that long for Twitter. So we had to shorten it. Got it.

1769
02:49:37.76 --> 02:49:42.96
Instagram Rob Jones for Congress. YouTube Rob Jones for Congress. Echo. Anything else?

1770
02:49:42.96 --> 02:49:48.72
Thank you. Rob Jones for coming again. Rob. Any final thoughts? Yeah. You know, I've been lucky enough.

1771
02:49:48.72 --> 02:49:57.20
There have been kind of three main influences in my life. External influences. Marine Corps.

1772
02:49:58.72 --> 02:50:04.56
Jim Jones, which maybe we can talk about some day as well. I had a big impact me at the right time.

1773
02:50:05.52 --> 02:50:13.28
Finally, you know, tree ownership, jacco, echo, the podcast and everything. And I've been lucky enough

1774
02:50:13.28 --> 02:50:21.20
to not only interact with all three of those. Become a part of all three of those. Befriend all three

1775
02:50:21.20 --> 02:50:28.72
of those. You know, I'm just, I just remain incredibly grateful that I've had these opportunities.

1776
02:50:28.72 --> 02:50:34.40
So thanks for having me on again. Looking forward to the next time already. Well, as you can imagine,

1777
02:50:34.40 --> 02:50:39.60
the doors always open anytime you want to come on. You know, just knowing you here in your story

1778
02:50:39.60 --> 02:50:45.20
getting to see the way that you're operating out in the world, I throw that out there. Oh,

1779
02:50:45.20 --> 02:50:49.52
he's an inspiration. You're an inspiration, bro. I mean, the fact of what you've done,

1780
02:50:49.52 --> 02:50:55.36
what you continue to do, it's awesome. And it's awesome. You might think it's cool to be here.

1781
02:50:55.36 --> 02:51:02.48
It's even cooler for us for me to have you here and hang out and get to talk to you and hang out with

1782
02:51:02.48 --> 02:51:09.44
you. So thank you for coming back. More important. Thanks for the service and sacrifice that you've made

1783
02:51:09.44 --> 02:51:17.04
for our country and that you continue to make and what you're going to make in the future. You are

1784
02:51:17.04 --> 02:51:25.52
a leader. You are a warrior and thank you. And to the rest of our warriors out there that are

1785
02:51:25.52 --> 02:51:33.04
face to face with the forces of darkness in the world. Thanks to you all and to your families

1786
02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:39.28
for your service and your sacrifice. And here at home, thanks to our police and our law enforcement

1787
02:51:39.28 --> 02:51:45.12
and our firefighters and our paramedics and our EMTs and our dispatchers and our correctional officers

1788
02:51:45.12 --> 02:51:52.40
and our Border Patrol and our ICE agents and our Secret Service and all the first responders out there.

1789
02:51:52.40 --> 02:51:58.000
Thank you for protecting us here at home. And everyone else that's out there,

1790
02:52:00.08 --> 02:52:06.08
if you think you've kind of, you think you've kind of maxed out on what you can do.

1791
02:52:06.08 --> 02:52:13.92
If you think maybe it's time to back off the gas pedal a little bit and relax.

1792
02:52:16.56 --> 02:52:22.96
If you think you've given everything that you can give right now, well, while you're thinking

1793
02:52:22.96 --> 02:52:30.24
that, once you just take a moment and think about Rob Jones, think about Rob Jones, who's still

1794
02:52:30.24 --> 02:52:38.24
going, who's still going strong despite everything that life has thrown his way. He's still going

1795
02:52:38.24 --> 02:52:46.48
no matter what he gets up and he gets after it. And I recommend that you all do the same.

1796
02:52:46.48 --> 02:52:58.32
And until next time, this is Rob Jones, Aneko and Jocco out.
