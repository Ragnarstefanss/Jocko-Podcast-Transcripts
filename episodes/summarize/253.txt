I was even thinking about your explanation of the previous chapter of the inspection of your range safety program, and you like, hey, I kind of sure to made this a priority, and I'm like, man, I'm not here to say, I want to be really careful, like you said, like, what he's saying is right, but I honestly don't think I ever inspected anything. And I think that's the kind of the transition that you see, you know, someone like General Clark making towards the end of his careers, look, hey, this is General ship, you want to lead by suggest new one after barc orders of people. Telling you, hey, once every three months I'm going to come and inspect 40 items and it's going to take eight hours and you're going to be standing at a period rest of the whole time or I'm going to come down once a week. So for those of you who don't know, you got a fire team leader, you got a squad leader, you got a platoon leader, and then you get to a company commander or even a task unit commander. So I wasn't sure how much I was going to get into this whole inspection mode because what I don't want to do is create a bunch of leaders that are going out there becoming these inspection happy, you know, dig down hell, coming in and inspect you. Yeah, that was like a four minute evolution where I was we were, we were, I don't know, probably a third of the way into a really well, it's going to be a long podcast and I think, oh, well, I guess his leadership principles don't really mess up with mine. People got to know what people got to know with the chain of command. And then the common thread is he basically just captured almost all those things are things that we impose upon ourselves, which in some sense is like it's kind of crazy because as I dissect what he's saying and like, well, how much control do I have over that? If you're in a leadership role and you're inspecting your people, or if you want to take it to set further, if someone else is coming in, like the IG is this in the military, the IG is this other group, this inspector general group is another team that actually comes into inspect you. Not like, hey, there are components and I think you actually did a good job because, yeah, you know what, life happens You know, I never want people to think that the military is what the military is portrayed in boot camp, which is you're getting inspected all the time. If you want to learn about leadership or you want to help you want us to help get your leadership, get your company's leadership aligned and all singing off the same page and crushing. If you want to check out what Dave Burke looks like, you want to see us laughing at each other, making fun of each other, shaking, shaking our heads and being surprised and shocked and trying to figure things out. So I actually did inspections all the time, but I really couldn't think of a time that in my years in command where I did an inspection, this is an inspection, be prepared for that inspection. I would like to go further into this particular field and point out to you that I believe we have become an exact and in exact in the use of terminology because I was reading last night a memorandum which said that we teach leadership at the command and general staff college from the level of the division commander up. So how to inspect or turn on how to inspect civilians often think of a non-commissioned officer and officer as a demon inspector, a demon inspector, a good inspector is certainly not a demon, but good inspectors are not plentiful in the army or out of it. I think that as he looks back at his career, I got to remember this guy joined when he was when he was a kid and he was in a world war one and think about how things changed by his own admission in between the world war one and world. So I'm just going to assess somebody's going to measure or evaluate and we owe this to the squadron because if we can't do this, it's going to affect this and we're not going to fire points.
