That's a big like learning channel too when you think about it because you can see like Like like of course how the inner workings of American businesses But like how that just like this just like and they they've done it many times before where it's like an issue will come up and you can see like How they'll solve the issue and it's unique to that specific thing so it's like okay, you can kind of it's like a demonstration I think it was like 13 to 15 dudes down there and the first couple have like suicide vessel guy Chuck's a grenade up it hits our EOD guy in the chest They dive like behind some furniture the the grenade went low order so You want to talk about someone looking out for you that it was old, you know, so it didn't blow up to its full potential and The avalanche call came out because they saw the S vessel on the dude so avalanche everybody runs out of the house and as the last dude runs out You know our hombees are already Ready to go and as soon as the last dude last man out it was like 50 cows like boobo boobo and we don't know if like a 50 cow Hit someone's vest or if the dude clocked himself off, but the house blew up The house blew up and Some of the guys were we're still alive. I learned a lot I learned a lot from It was the first time to where I kind of heard the T.L. like during a gun fight like just how calm and collected they were It was just like as if nothing was happening and I didn't I remember that thinking about that in my head like I want to be like that You know like okay cool. And because you said you said something kind of interesting where you're like okay on the third time after you got rolled or whatever third time you passed with no no issues you said a lot of people like buds is like real hard for them Did you feel that your work ethic that was established Like was the factor that made it like a non-issue like could you feel that at the time? Yeah, and also when you're in the cold water they like your handle and maybe for Like an eye me they depends who you are obviously but after like an hour it's almost like the coldness like you get hit with that initial coldness and your body's like I'm not that cold so commander I'm thinking like why like I don't know anything about J-Taxle stuff and the J-O that was there He'd actually gone to like a J-Taxle Really really intelligent guy like super intelligent waste smarter than me and I'm like what am I gonna do over there? I think I was a blue belt for like I Wanted and then when I got back to San Diego So, you know, I had to like re-earn my Risp it was like I it was like when I wasn't at Fabios he's I wasn't training He's like whatever And I'm like okay, you know Like check he's like we take batteries and this and that he's like I'm like okay got it He's awesome man his dad like would just come out Is a lot of times nowadays you see like the dads all ended you did too and that's why the kids are there Yeah, almost against their will It didn't seem like Aaron's dad was into it, but he's like oh, this is what my kid wants to cool I'm gonna sit here every day, you know for two hours on the bench waiting for my kid to get done with this Whatever this weird stuff is that he's doing. well It was simply because they were humble like you could just tell their attitude right off the bat Like they're like you know when you give them you know criticism or critiques or whatever They're like got it got it whereas the platoons that did terrible right like so you got used to hard work really Quickly and thoroughly essentially Could you feel that like as you know you go through like you know hard things and combat buds like all these hard things or whatever He's like Hey, you need to move your cart I was like hey bro there seems to be a problem like you know with your ticket stuff I'm like they called the tow truck but I think if you call them, you know and work something out and they're just like, oh don't worry about it and like it'll happen like they just I just feel like they weren't concerned about it at all And for being honest I wasn't a fan of theirs like I could just just didn't get a good feeling from them yeah, I want to go to Buds He's like you want to do what he's like I was like I want to go to Buds eventually like I'm just kind of doing this You know my time with the Marines and until I could get the Buds and He grabs my paperwork. I was the corpsman coverage for that But during that deployment that's where I like got really serious about learning how to swim and I was in the pool every chance I could get like if if I had the time I would go in the mornings I would go a lunch and that's why Oh, because it was a guy that I met that dropped out of Buds and Hmm and I told him I was like do you know how to do the combat sidestroke and he's like yeah, no I'm like that wasn't me that was someone else who doesn't even look like me like he's a white dude Like it's nothing like me It looks almost exactly like mine like FMF Corman You know teams USD finance degree and then he's like hey, bro I'm actually gonna go to UCLA and I'm like why is that? You're gonna get chilly woo factors with that because one you're not having fun You know like well, you do it like you actually don't even notice a lot of stuff when you're having like fun You don't notice how tired you're getting you don't know that notice a lot of stuff colds probably one of those when you're you know oh It was kind of odd because there's just like an old man Some women and children like it's kind of odd and you know as we're on target or whatever We start finding some like propaganda We start finding like some small stuff And then he's like hey, bro like I need you to you know, our friend really likes you like I need you to To entertain her while I'm with this girl and blah, blah, blah, I'm like do you not got a girlfriend? It only covers like a small portion I was still gonna have to take out like a six figure Just a six figure student loan and I've always been pretty frugal about my money on my day I don't want to take out this huge loan and then I kind of went into thought I'm like why do I want to go to one of these schools Like why do I really want to go? So I'm like okay, so I parked my park my cart behind this car the other team guy I don't know where he took off to like he's gone He must have been fine and like lots of tickets and so I'm sitting there and waiting for the tow truck and now I see everybody get out of football practice and The guys car the car who's you know Part behind the owner comes and it's a really big dude You know he's free of football player free jack dude big dude. and so it's funny because As I'm getting on the Hilo to leave he's getting there and we're crossing paths and I'm like bro Why am I getting sent there like I don't know what I'm doing he's like don't worry about it dude people like you But you know he's like hey man get out do the rest of it and and that screener was actually legit like it was tough Like it was a rock run it was like pull ups push ups And what's crazy is like when I was at trade at you know you talked about the the four laws of combat a lot and we talked about like Find what your red flags are and in the teams my red flag when I got overwhelmed was You know when that thought came in my head like I don't know what to do right now. I don't know it was just like this moment like a light bulb moment and from that point on like I was like land I've got it So I just started reaching out to people on LinkedIn like sending them my resume and I would put in like whatever bank US like I would put Air Force Veteran Marine Corps Veteran I'm like dude if anybody's gonna answer me it's gonna be a veteran god and I said hey, bro man Just can you do me favor just check me on this like just look at this guy's face when I'm putting out word and just give me I go cuz it seems to me Like it doesn't want to hear anything from anybody I just want to make sure I'm not totally off base, but can you just check him out and so sure enough like as I As I'm talking you look I've used that with his arms crossed and and and I get I'm just saying I'm not even like saying do you're totally jacked up? It was a great course and The chief that was running it You know, I was like asking him questions cuz I always want to know you know what would be a good thing to bring when we're in the field and I said Hey, you know, or guy, you know, should I bring like a sleeping bag? I'm I'm doing parking services because you know USD's a private school And the Navy only pays like I think it was like I don't I shouldn't say only they pay 10k And the tuition at USD's like 40k a year like 40 something k a year It was like the Marine Corps PFT and then it was like all these different calisthenics with with no number You just did it for time and they had a number that they wouldn't tell you So like hey you got to do this amount of mountain climbers and they wouldn't tell you it was like a day long Screener Oh my god, so now I'm just like I don't know what to do so you know I make some phone calls and they're like that's stupid You're not gonna go be a slow you're turning back here The only the only problem is you're gonna have to go to the process just like everyone else So you know I go in there and then During one of the The ass chewings that I'm getting I'm like you know what I'm like if you guys really take me to a trident review board This is like what would you know? I can avoid getting hit like there's all these amazing things that we literally did not know as humans We did not know and if you were to go out and a fight and if I would have gotten no fight in in 1990 or 1991 I Would do what my instincts are throw haymakers whatever like whatever it is a human is gonna do is what I would do and then all of a sudden as soon as I learn Oh the joke Like all And if it seems like this leader like maybe they have a big ego and they think they're a badass You know, I don't care I always wanted to make sure that it wasn't me that it wasn't my end I was like okay, you know what the guy's got a big ego. the least yeah every time I do another job I'm just just solidifies that decision for sure It's weird where you thinking Because because the first gigs that you did was teaching FTX which is like our fuel training exercise which is You know, I'm JP and I've talked about this where I'm like a HAP people don't they don't need to really like know how to Clear room He's like if you're gonna be my point man You need to know how to use a GPS Because I'm like you know under my poncho my red lens like looking at my map and trying to figure it all out and then So they're like go to this combat engineer in battalion and you can work out all day and that's where I met this guy named Captain Gwen Who had like a master's degree in can easyology and was all about in the fitness and when he learned that I was going to buds He's like let me train you I was like your series. And I'm really like trying to be like hey bro like listen I am like the low man on the total pull and now the rest of the football team is coming out and I could follow directions I was like that was the one thing I could really do so they're like you know you haven't failed anything at all They're like you know what we're gonna roll you one last time and it's like it's like the jackpot of all Like violations like we got because we were having trouble meeting our quota I'm not saying anything like that I'd say something like hey man, do you ever think about maybe you know putting some vehicles over here on this target and you can see the guys like arms Car I'm not I'm just offering the suggestion You know I just got promoted for five to Lieutenant So for like the rest of the deployment or sorry the the rest of the time on the ship He's like calling me sir and whatnot and at one point You know I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle because we're doing like some sniper stuff I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle and the CEO knows who we are we're on his ship
