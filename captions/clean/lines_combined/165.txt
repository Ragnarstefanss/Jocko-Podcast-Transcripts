00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 165 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.50 Good evening, I've said that war is the ultimate teacher.
00:00:19.50 --> 00:00:27.000 And I think it's also true to say that war is the ultimate revealer.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000 It reveals a side of people that would not normally be allowed to come out.
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000 Because in war there's so much happening, there's so much pressure, there's so much emotion.
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000 So intense and I saw people change and I don't want to make this overly dramatic.
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000 And in most cases I'm not talking about some big dramatic transformation that a person goes through.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000 But I am talking about changes and the changes were often visible.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000 Visible things that would be out of character for someone.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000 They start acting a different way.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000 Sometimes negative and sometimes positive.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000 There might be someone who's temper gets quick.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000 It starts to flare up.
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000 There might be someone that becomes more understanding, more forgiving.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000 Some people were happier in combat.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000 And some were just absolutely stressed to the core.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And when I look back now, it becomes very clear that there were some,
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000 I'll call it oscillations in my own attitude.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000 There were sometimes when I had to real myself in.
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000 I definitely try and stay professional at all times.
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000 That's kind of what I do.
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000 I try to play the game.
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000 I try not to get emotional.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000 That's just how I try and roll.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000 But I could feel it sometimes.
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Starting to come apart a little bit.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000 And I would have to breathe mentally, mentally, breathe, consciously.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Pull the pieces back together.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000 So I don't lose my temper.
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000 I don't lose my composure.
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000 And I know that that's a good quality.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000 It's one that I saw other leaders in act.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000 And I thought that that was a positive quality.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000 And it's one that I tried to emulate.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000 And I got pretty good at emulating that quality.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000 But sometimes on deployment, I really had to focus on that.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000 I had to focus on keeping my composure.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000 I had to focus on not getting emotional.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000 I had to detach and tell myself to settle down and keep it together.
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000 And it's not easy to do.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 And some people have a hard time doing that.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000 And they get sure fused and they lose their temper.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000 The drop of a hat once they're under the stress of sustained combat.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000 Others will not do that.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000 Others will go numb.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 And they'll just kind of turn off.
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000 And I tried to stay balanced.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000 Not to completely turn off my emotions, but at the same time not get emotional.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000 But I had to think about that.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000 And it consciously think about that.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 And there were other things that I noticed about myself,
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000 especially when I look back.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000 One thing I noticed is that the little things they they really didn't.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Really didn't matter.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 Anymore.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000 They lost things of little importance.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000 Pretty much lost all importance.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000 If no one was dead and no one was wounded, then things were going to be okay.
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 That's how it was for me.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 And some people go in the opposite direction.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000 They start to lose their mind over little, meaningless things.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000 And what they're doing when they lash out in those situations is that's how they're letting out the.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000 Seaving all encompassing stress that they're feeling.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000 Another thing I noticed is that I'm normally.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000 Very tactful when I communicate with people up and down the chain of command.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 And it's pretty natural for me.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000 I've been doing it for so long.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 I'm thinking about what I'm saying.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000 I'm making sure I'm saying the right things and they're being understood correctly.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000 I understand the importance of communicating from a leadership perspective.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000 But during combat deployments, I can tell you I had to think a little bit more.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000 I had to put a little bit more thought into what I was saying because the urge I was fighting against.
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000 Often was this urge just to be.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000 Offensively blunt.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000 Just blunt.
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.000 And really even condescending or sarcastic or patronizing or snide or mocking or cutting.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000 Because there is some level of madness in war.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000 There just is.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000 I mean, let's face it.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000 You're going to go out and you're trying to kill people and they're trying to kill you.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000 And your friends are trying to kill their friends and their friends are trying to kill your friends.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000 That's not normal.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000 That's if you take that out of context, that's just madness.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:35.000 And that madness in war, it can creep into your head and then very easily it can creep out of your mouth if you let it.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000 And these were all these types of things that they happen to me.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000 They happen to everyone.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000 I think I had a pretty good handle on it.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000 And some people handle it better.
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000 Some people handle it worse.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 The combat situations I was in.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000 There's people that have gone through infinitely harder combat scenarios for all of mankind from the history of mankind.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000 Everyone in these situations is going to have to react to them in some way.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000 Everyone's going to be impacted by that madness of war.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000 And like I said, they're going to react in different ways depending on who they are depending on their background, depending on their personality.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000 But the war itself is going to reveal.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000 It's going to reveal strengths and weaknesses. It's going to reveal fears and regrets.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000 It's going to reveal ego and selflessness.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:54.000 And when we see death, when we face death and when our friends and our comrades are wounded and mailed and killed,
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000 that has an effect.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:14.000 And you might think, how hard do I have to pull in on the reins of my own fury and hatred and murderous thoughts?
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000 When young man after young man is sent home in a flag draped coffin,
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000 I can tell you I had to pull in those reins hard.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000 And I wasn't alone.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000 I was surrounded by men with the same vengeful thoughts.
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000 But those thoughts have to be tempered and they have to be controlled or else everything falls apart.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000 But those thoughts get revealed because of war.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000 And war reveals things about us that otherwise might slip by.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000 Things we might not want to share.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000 Thoughts that we might not even know are a part of us.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000 But they are a part of us.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000 And in the end war ultimately reveals who we are.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000 It reveals our nature.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000 And thereby reveals human nature itself.
00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:00.000 And we can imagine that understanding all these different actions and reactions from your subordinate leaders from your commanders,
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000 from your troops, from yourself.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:16.000 There is no way to effectively lead without some understanding of all these people and their nature.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:29.000 People that you must work with in order to accomplish the mission in order to win.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000 While that is crystal clear in war, it applies to every undertaking.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000 It applies to everything that you try and do.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000 Knowing the people you work with, understanding the people you work with, knowing and understanding your enemy,
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000 knowing and understanding yourself.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000 Knowing and understanding psychology and human nature and the better you can do that.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000 The better you will perform as a team and as an individual.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000 Then especially as a leader.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000 And we spent the last podcast talking about the first part of a book called Psychology for the Fighting Man.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000 What you should know about yourself and others.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:41.000 It's a very straightforward book written in 1942, right as World War II was kicking off.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000 And on the last podcast we covered the early sections in the book about things like putting the right people in the right jobs,
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000 about the importance of training, about the best ways to teach and learn and how to become more efficient.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:10.000 And today we're going to dive into the second half of the same book, which gets into some incredibly insightful and some incredibly revealing topics.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000 So let's go back to the book.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000 Kicking off with this section.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000 It's actually not the second half of the book.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000 This is probably the last third of the book that we're getting into.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 And let's start off with this section.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 That's about morale.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000 Here we go.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000 It all depends on the incentives to human action on men's motives on their emotions and how they react to their emotions.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:57.000 It can be developed in a military unit by the control of those psychological conditions, which determine men's desires and conduct and affect their attitudes toward one another and toward the great undertaking of winning a war.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000 And we're going to talk about incentives. Some of these are pretty obvious starting off with hunger.
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Hunger is a mess called most sure to be heard.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000 Pain is an alert seldom missed.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000 The most primitive incentives for action, which man shares with other animals, are his bodily needs.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000 Hunger thirst sex.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:32.000 The need for rest when he is tired, the need for activity when rested, the desire to escape from pain, extreme heat, extreme cold, and other intolerable conditions.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000 It might be possible to control men or animals by the use of these incentives.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000 You might make a man go hungry until his work is done.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And then let him eat as a reward.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000 You might make a man fight by lashing him and then letting up on him as a reward for fighting.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000 But that isn't the way the R Army works.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000 Whenever possible it supplies enough food and rest to its soldiers and makes other provisions for their comfort so that they stay in good spirits and can do their work well.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000 But in areas, but in fighting areas it's not always possible to provide these physical comforts.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000 When food or water is short, when the weather is too hot or too cold, when it becomes impossible to bathe and shave, when bombs and shells drive sleep away.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000 And fatigue makes a man that makes effort a torture, problems combat morale arise.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:41.000 And then some other incentive is required beyond their animal need to keep men going to make them determined to keep fighting unto death.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000 When the primitive needs are no longer enough, it is the social incentives which help a fighting man do his utmost.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000 There are many social needs here or some of them.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000 So, interesting way to kick it off.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000 And those are so obvious, we all know those things.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000 We all know that we, if we're hungry, we all know if we, we try to escape from pain.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000 We all know we try and find comfort.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000 If there's discomfort, I know you especially know that.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 But when those things, you can't always provide those things.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000 And it's, you know what's really interesting.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000 We're talking about, it's just words, right?
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Just words in a book, talking about to make them determined to keep on fighting unto death.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000 Just words in a book right now.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:44.000 But if you think about, well, this is World War II, we're getting ready to go and hundreds of thousands of men are going to go and fight unto the death.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000 And these primitive needs aren't going to be enough to drive.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000 So here's some social needs that people have.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000 Number one, desire for social approval, admiration, recognition, and appreciation.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000 Two, desire for security, safety, escape from danger and disapproval or fears of all kinds.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000 Number three, the desire for power, mastery, domination, superiority, and self-assertion.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000 Number four, desire for adventure, new experience, freedom, escape from futility, humdrum.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000 Number five, desire for personal response, companionship, friendship, love.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000 Number six, desire to help and protect others, especially the weak and helpless such as children.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000 Number seven, desire for a successful achievement, completeness, effectiveness, the desire to do a good job.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000 Number eight, desire to destroy interference with other desires, aggression and rage.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000 That's a, that's a, it's when you hear when I'm reading that list, I think of little people that I've known and you know what was driving them.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Yeah.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000 I remember thinking this.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000 So you think of, you think of the military as a group of people.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000 Even I do, it's a group, you think of, oh, it's an army, it's a battalion, it's a brigade, it's a company, you think of it as a unit that's working together.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:39.000 But what I will tell you is these, these desires right here are so important for the conduct of warfare, because when you get down to a battalion level, a company level, a platoon level.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000 There's individual human beings that are driving that thing forward.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000 And if you didn't have a leader in charge or it doesn't necessarily have to be the platoon leader, but if you didn't have a platoon sergeant,
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000 if you didn't have someone in that organization, that was going to drive this thing forward, it wouldn't go anywhere.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000 When we do operations overseas, we'd work with the conventional forces overseas.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000 There was a guy that was making these things happen.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:17.000 That had that was driven by these types of things, whether, whether something I wanted to shine and get, get noticed,
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:27.000 then he's going to take his platoon out, or whether he realized, hey, the best thing I can do for survival ability is to get aggressive and go take the fight to the enemy.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000 All these things you can see where they come into play, and you see the same thing in civilian organizations.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:45.000 When you see what's driving me, you know, you ever hear the question of like a rich person, whatever that means, but how much is enough, right?
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000 There's very few people that become financially successful, that go, okay, you know what I'm good.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000 Okay, I've got two houses, three houses. I've got a bunch of really nice cars.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000 I've got a bunch of money in the bank. I'm good. I'm fine. I'm done.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:14.000 It doesn't happen very often. The folks that they achieve there, and then they look up and go, wait, I can do some more.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.000 And whether that's, you know, just completing a job, like it says, the desire to do a good job, or the desire to help other people,
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000 hey, the more money I get, the more I can give to other people, like these things are real, and they really drive.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000 And so when you see a organization get stagnant, you've got to look and say to yourself, which, how can we fuel this desire?
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000 How can we allow this mission to answer some of these desires?
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000 Going back to the book, when a military leader calls a man by name and gives him a simple word of commendation for some task well performed.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000 He's appealing to at least two or three natural incentives, calling a man by name shows personal interest, which almost every soldier likes.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:12.000 The commendation is social approval. If the soldier has been feeling insecure, not quite sure of things, then perhaps his sense of security is established by the event of his leaders approval.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000 He also has assurance that he has accomplished a job well done. That's, think about that.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:28.000 All it is, and I've talked about that a bunch on here where I say, you know, sometimes leaders don't realize how powerful it is to say, hey, echo really good work on that last video.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000 People don't realize her. Hey, echo really good job holding security last night on that position.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000 And I've said it's powerful. Now, it's here's why. Here's some of the things that that feeds that person.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000 These desires that they want satisfied get fed when a leader steps down and gives a commendation like that.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000 Back to the book, social approval is a strong mode of inhuman affairs. And in general, praise is much more effective than blame.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000 The commendation can get results when ballings out fail by ballings out. They mean yelling at people. Reproved tends to leave resentment.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:18.000 This is so smart. Blame is often, however, effective when used in private and in moderation against a man whose quality of performance is high for you will work hard to avoid such criticism.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Anyways, I had the luxury of oftentimes working with people where if they mess something up, they got in trouble, whatever you didn't need to. I didn't need to do anything.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:40.000 I could basically say, I heard what happened. And that was enough like they were just never they were never going to stop until they corrected that in my eyes.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000 Yeah, I could see that. A man wants to count to amount to something to feel that he is worthwhile and appreciated.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Promotion citations and distinctions of all kinds helps serve this purpose.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:03.000 Fear of the disprovals of others or some other form of punishment works as an incentive, but it is not as good as a steady thing.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Troops coerced into action by snapping, Martinette become anxious, disgruntled jittery. There is a loss in morale and initiative in judgment even in skill.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000 Men do better in groups whether fighting or working. And one thing that's interesting and we're going to get to there's a section in this part of the book called leadership.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:38.000 And there's a definite dichotomy and you can hear it here, start to talk about how it sometimes it leans towards the stereotypical military idea of like if I tell you what to do you do it.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.000 But every time it leans towards that, it counters it. It counters it and says, look, if people don't respect you, look, if you're not under people don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:07.000 Like it always comes back to the true leadership, even though it brushes up and it conferses about some of the stereotypical military leadership, it certainly every time counters them with real true leadership.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:20.000 Back to the book, a soldier's desire to do a good job. His sense of workmanship is helped whenever he can be allowed to understand the nature of the whole undertaking which he is contributing to which he is contributing.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000 A successful leader never signs tasks blindly when he can reveal their larger purpose.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:36.000 By allowing his men to see the significance of their own smaller jobs, he dignifies the lesser tasks by relating them to the large one.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000 This is always make sure your people understand why they're doing what they're doing. That's what it is.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000 A successful leader never assigns tasks blindly.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000 He wants to make sure that the subordinates understand the nature of the whole undertaking to which he's contributing. This stuff is so important.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Continuing on, morale is the capacity to stay on the job, especially a long hard job with determination and zest.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000 It is the opposite of apathy. morale needs good health, physical and mental, unless the body is well and vigorous. It is pretty hard to endure hardship and keep up enthusiasm.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:31.000 For teaguen, illness, sap, mental vigor and moral strength. The body does influence the mind. You have to hear that? The body does influence the mind.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000 Yet there is more to morale than that. Men can carry on with strong determination, sometimes even with zest, through injury, disease and physical privation.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000 For that sort of morale, a man needs self-confidence and conviction. He needs to feel sure of himself and emotionally secure.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:02.000 While there are no simple rules for obtaining this sense of security and confidence, when the world is blowing up around your ears, some of the conditions that bring it are known.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000 It helps to have grown up in a home where there is no quarreling or jealousy. It helps to have friends and to be working or fighting in a group.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000 It is essential for the job to seem important for a community related to some of the incentives to human action.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:29.000 A thoughtful man may need to see the job in its larger relations to fit into a philosophy of life, to make it a means of satisfying his own code of what is good and desirable.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:42.000 He may need to take a long range view that extends beyond his own lifetime and perhaps into another world. All incentives to human action are potential morale builders.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:53.000 There is a back and forth relation between work and morale. Not only does morale make soldiers work in fight, working in fighting, keep up their morale.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000 Somebody in the last podcast, somebody on Twitter just hammered out quotes from this book.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000 I was reading them, reading them because I'm reading this whole book and I'm just reading these quotes.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000 There are so many awesome quotes in this book. You can just make a book of quotes from just this book. That's one of them though.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:31.000 Not only does morale make soldiers work in fight, working in fighting, keep up their morale. It's 100% true, especially in times of emotional stress as in battle does a man need to be doing things.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000 As for work alone, men are not naturally lazy. People like to work in forced idolness as a cruel punishment.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000 It has been shown again and again that persons with useful jobs to do in air raids are unlikely to be afraid of bombs.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000 They are busy and the morale is good. They carry on because they have important and useful work to do.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.000 Actually, they feel secure. Even in an air raid, which is a strange place to feel secure, it is the same with the train soldier in the midst of combat.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:14.000 That stuff is brilliant right there. That's brilliant. That's why you have standard operating procedures. That's why you have an immediate action drills when you get attacked by the enemy.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000 Everyone knows what their job is supposed to be. It doesn't even allow them time to be scared.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000 I have one parachute failure where I pulled my reserve parachute.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.000 I got to the ground and I got to the ground and I was jumping with at the time.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000 We were all kind of the same level except for maybe one guy that had a ton of jumps.
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000 But all my friends, all my platoon mates were all pro you pulled your reserve.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000 I was like, yeah, yeah. They were like, bro, was it sketchy?
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:59.000 I thought about it and said, no, I did what we trained to do. Arch look grab, look grab, pull pull check check.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000 I did what the procedure says to do. That's what I was thinking about. That's what I was focused on.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000 That's what I did.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000 If I didn't have a protocol to follow, it's like my parachute is going to fail.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000 I'm going to die in 12 seconds or whatever it is.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000 You're dead in 12 seconds if something good doesn't happen real quick.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000 It's not even 12 seconds because you're at 2000 feet in your fallen.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000 Yeah, it's not very much time. You're going to be dead pretty quick as what I'm saying.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000 Yeah. And I didn't even think about it. And I got to the ground and it wasn't.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000 It's like my adrenaline didn't even move.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000 Right.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000 Because you're doing what you're supposed to do.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000 Yeah. Like you. And obviously we're thinking about it.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000 Not in the situation. So yeah, it's all scary.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000 I mean, you pull one shoot. It doesn't work.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000 And I'm saying outside of the procedure. You know, I'm saying the facts of the reality of the situation.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000 You pull one shoot. It doesn't work.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000 Proof that parachutes don't work to you right then and then that proof.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000 Oh, if you want to start digging up and you're holding you, you're going to real deep.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000 That's what I'm talking about.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000 And then now, guess I'm going to issue two only have left.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000 One. You already witnessed firsthand one shoot fail.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000 So far on this parachute jump, you're 100% fail rate.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Your pair of suits.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000 And only that one more chance.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000 One love.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Yeah. Within 10 seconds or whatever.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Yeah.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000 You know, so really your brain is like, yeah, this is it.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000 You know, if you think of it that way.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000 But yeah, if your mind is occupied with, okay,
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000 procedure procedure procedure and then you just do do do do.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000 And then it's like, you don't have time to be scared about anything.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.000 No.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000 Unless they're, you know, if the second one fails, then it's different.
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Obviously, but you know, you, you,
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000 yeah, your mind doesn't have room to start making all these,
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000 these fearful assessments, you know, action.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000 Taking action is a real positive thing in so many situations when you start
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000 be feeling fear.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000 You got to do something.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000 You got to step up and do something.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000 That's like, you know, in, in like a jujitsu tournament or whatever,
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000 like a competition situation.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Um, I don't want to imagine it be like this.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000 If you're talking publicly or whatever before you do it,
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000 like, okay, before I want to, I used to compete a lot in jiujitsu before.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000 I'm like, oh, my gosh, like, your anxious and you just, like,
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000 the feeling beforehand is like way different than when right when he says start.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000 When you said start, you don't, you're not even interested in the market.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000 Yeah, which you do every day anyway.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000 Kind of thing.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000 And because you know what to do and that's what your mind is on.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000 You're not feeling like, even though you don't even know this guy.
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000 You never even seen this guy before.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000 So you don't know what mystery this guy holds, you know?
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000 I'm just saying that's kind of what you're thinking.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000 It's a four people.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000 But once you, yeah, for sure, hesitation is the,
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000 is the moment that you have to overcome for fear.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 And action will help you do that.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000 Back to the book.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000 If an officer wants to assess the morale of his own unit,
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 there are at least two things for him to do.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000 He can listen.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000 Men will talk and permit it or encourage to,
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000 and they will sometimes speak freely.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000 When they do, they give their leader information.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 Not will enable him to answer these questions.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Do the troops feel like they're being well trained.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000 Well, lead.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000 Do they think their weapons are adequate?
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000 Do they want to try to get the enemy?
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000 Are they proud of their unit?
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000 Do they have suggestions for its improvement?
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000 Do they have, do they think they get fair treatment?
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000 Fair chances for advancement?
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000 Are they worrying about anything back home?
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000 Or what about what will happen when the war is over?
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000 From the answers to questions like these,
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000 an officer can usually estimate accurately the morale of his unit.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000 He can also study the behavior of his men.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000 Are they ready to volunteer for special duty?
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000 Are they frequent violations of discipline?
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000 How many are AWAL?
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000 How many in the guard house?
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000 What is the rate of venereal disease?
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 How do they receive bad rumors?
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Are there many fights and are the fights based on religious or racial differences?
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000 The problem is the primary task of leadership.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000 Actually, it says a primary task.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000 The leader, any leader trying to improve the morale of his unit will find these rules helpful.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000 So, one of the main things you have to do as a leader is keep morale up.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000 No doubt about that.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000 If your morale falls apart inside of a team, you're in a bad situation.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000 And here's some things to help you improve morale.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000 One, make each man feel he is needed by his unit that his job is important.
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000 Two, never let a man forget that he is a soldier
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000 and that a soldier of the United States Army is an important and respected person.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000 Three, make it very clear that the unit has its own important function in winning.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000 The war.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000 Four, encourage the expression of pride in achievements of the unit.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000 Five, give commendation and encouragement when it comes in, when it comes in,
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000 sincerely and appropriately be given for fair appreciation.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000 Usually works better than condemnation.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Six, never belittle or humiliate a man in front of others,
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000 except when a military emergency as in battle may require quick correction.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:31.000 When the review is necessary, do it in private and make clear, make it clear that it is the act that is punished not the man.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Seven, keep idleness at a minimum, but make recreation possible.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000 A little dichotomy, you have to balance there.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000 Train each man in every useful task and action that actual combat will require
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000 and teach him that these habits will reduce his fear when combat comes as well as make him a trained and able fighter.
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000 Nine, let men work together in groups whenever possible because the social relation increases effectiveness and ten,
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000 but the soldier on isolated duty feel that he is an indispensable man, not a forgotten one.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000 Great advice there.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000 How often, and this is something I've talked about.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000 I always, in the way I used to say this is I would say I want every person I put to and think that their job is the most important job in the sealative.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000 I want the point man to think hey, point man, if you don't know where you're going, everyone's lost.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000 You got the most important job and the put to and commander, hey, this is your patrol, your the guy in charge,
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000 you're the got the most important job and the radio man, hey, radio man, if something goes sideways out there,
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000 it's you with your ability to communicate with air assets and other support elements that are going to save everyone.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000 You're the most important guy.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000 And then the medic, hey, if someone gets shot, you're the guy, it's like I go right on down the line.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000 Everyone thinks, and what's what's.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000 I'm not, I'm not lying to them.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000 I'm actually telling them the truth.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000 I'm actually telling them the truth in critical situations.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000 Someone in that platoon is going to be the most important person.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000 It's not the same all the time.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 I'm telling them the truth.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000 The truth is, if you're the radio man and you're getting overwhelming enemy fire and that
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000 radio man can reach out and drop bombs on the enemy, he's the most important guy in the platoon without question.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000 If you're trying to get to an extract point who's going to get to get your platoon out of there,
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000 then the point man is the one that knows where he's going and no one else knows,
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000 that point man's the most important person.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000 When you're in a machine gun fight, when you're in a gun fight,
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000 it's the machine gunners that are to lay down fire and allow you to cover and move and
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000 close with and destroy the enemy.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000 It's the machine gunners, most important.
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000 You take away the machine guns and assume, you got a real problem on your hand.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000 So I'm not lying to anyone.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000 I'm telling them the truth.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000 The truth is, you have the most important job in this platoon.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000 That's the truth.
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000 And when people hear that man, it's important too.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000 Yeah.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000 And he goes back, the book goes back and making sure that everyone understands how important
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000 what the unit is doing to the strategic victory.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000 And talking about pride and unity,
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000 especially the we were overseas and army units would have their battle streamers that
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000 they bring historical documents and hang them up in the wall and they're in their
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 make shift up center.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000 From World War II, hanging them up, post your paper or paper clippings from World War II.
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000 And they're hanging them up.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000 This is who are unit.
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 This is what we've done.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000 We are upholding tradition.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000 We have pride in what we do.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000 So awesome.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000 It's a real thing.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000 Next little section is about zest.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000 Zest is the fabric from which morale is made.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000 Zest, vigor of spirit, love of life coupled with a willingness and eagerness to risk
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000 life itself in a good undertaking.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000 A spirit of high adventure that turns a difficult mission into a rare chance to show the
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000 stuff of which men are made.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000 This is the weapon that makes a military unit unbeatable.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000 Think of a mission as a rare chance to show the stuff of which men are made.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000 Highly motivated.
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Zest depends first upon physical fitness.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000 It demands a sharp appetite that will make a soldier eat plentifully and digest his food.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000 It requires physical exercise that brings plenty of oxygen into the lungs and plenty of red blood circulating
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000 to the brain and back to the hands and legs.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000 If a man is to meet the sunrise with any sort of spirit for the new day, he must have slept at night,
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000 sound and understood by anxious dreams within him or by vermin in his bed.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000 Fatigue can quickly reduce a fighting spirit.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000 This symptoms of mental fatigue, whether in the air or on the ground are a stalinist,
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000 a lack of interest in the job to be done, lack of enthusiasm, enthusiasm, a heaviness of limbs,
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000 eyelids, even of the will that makes it well-nigh impossible to drag through the day's duties.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000 And with it shortness of temper, irritability and the blues.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000 All leaders have to be constantly on guard against this insidious, spiritual, fifth columnists
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000 among their men and among themselves.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000 Regardless of how invaluable the man when fatigue is made at this attack on his fitness,
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000 he must have relief.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000 He must be required to sleep, to take respite from responsibility, to get away from the strain
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000 he has been under, otherwise the price is a psychological casualty.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000 And the more important the man, the greater the cost to the army.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000 Make sure you people are getting some rest as much as you can.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000 And again, this book counters these things all the time by saying,
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 hey, there's sometimes where you're not going to be able to rest.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 That's the way it is.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000 So then what you have to do is you have to understand if to understand that.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000 That's what this book is about.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000 You have to understand now what are the risks involved.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000 Now we've got a unit that is severely fatigued in battle-worn.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000 What are the risks?
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000 And not going to be able to fight as well as they did when they were fresh.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000 If you don't know that, perhaps you send them in the front line to another battle.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000 If you know it, you take another group that was in the rear and you send them in the front line,
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000 you let the guys that are fatigued be the reserves.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000 That's why if they know and understand these things.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000 Back to the book, excessive physical discomfort can also eventually
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000 dead in all zest for life and for battle.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000 Men can fight with their socks stiff with dirt or frozen to their feet with
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000 hands so swollen and crack that they can barely pull a trigger.
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000 They have fought when the baths are unknown and shaves are almost as scarce
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000 when marching must be done through seas of mud and clothing never dries.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000 And when the eyes are cut and lungs are choked with never settling crowds of dust and sand,
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000 men have fought and are fighting under such conditions.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000 But it takes an unquenchable spirit to keep it zest when things are like this.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000 Whole armies have shown this spirit, but such conditions prolonged,
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000 get in zest in the end and therefore must be relieved whenever possible.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000 When a man has his first encounter with the immediate threat of death,
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000 when he must kill and see men killed, when he must steal himself to hear the unheeded cries
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000 of the mortally wounded and endure the stench of battle, a man may become sick
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000 in his very vitals. He may lose interest in his food and yet this will be no sign of
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000 squeamishness. The toughest of leather next may feel intensely the inward revolting
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000 and horror the battlefield can provoke.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000 The defenses against these physical and mental foes of the spirit are faith in good
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000 leaders, a loyalty to them and to comrades and a shoulder to shoulder, feeling of
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000 solidarity with the other men of the outfit.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000 I can go anywhere and stand anything my captain and the rest of my outfit can.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000 Got to set that good example.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000 Fear, ally or traitor.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000 The first battle, the first experience of having an enemy machine gun aimed at you,
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000 the first time an airplane swoops low to lay its deadly eggs in your particular
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000 patch of ground. That is an experience anticipated by the young soldier with mingle
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000 dread and eagerness. He is eager by that time to get at the enemy.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000 He is learned a great deal about the science of war and wants to use this knowledge
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000 to wipe out the enemy in gain victory.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000 But he always wonders, every man does just how he will behave when the time comes.
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000 He doesn't feel like a hero.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000 If he is honest, completely honest with himself, he knows he will be scared, terrified.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000 The experienced soldier who has been through all this the first time and many other times
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000 has found out for certain that every man going into battle is scared.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000 His hands tremble, his throat is dry, he must swallow constantly because his heart isn't as
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000 mouth. He does idiotic things like looking at his watch every few seconds or examining his
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000 heart. He is a powerful soldier. He is the only one so disturbed but it is true of all the
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000 veteran as well.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000 And it is true of the enemy.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000 Germans and Japs get just as scared as Americans in British.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000 The bad moments do not come during actual combat, however, but in the time of tense
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000 waiting just before.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000 As soon as the frightened man is able to go into action to do something effective against the
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000 enemy, especially if it involves a violent physical action, his fright is apt to be
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000 dispeled or forgotten because he is too busy fighting to remember it.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000 And this is great propaganda to talk about because what they are basically, they are
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000 doing this book to young soldiers that are getting ready to go and fight.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000 And what they are telling them is look, you are going to be scared, everyone is scared.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000 So that way they don't get scared and freak out because they are scared.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000 Airplane pilots who had distinguished themselves in action against the Japanese said when asked
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000 whether they were scared during those moments of acute peril, why I don't know.
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000 There was too much to do, we didn't have time to think.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000 We are scared at first, wrote a member of a torpedoed ship.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Sure we were.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000 But when the torpedo hit us, we forgot all about it.
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000 There wasn't much time and then there was much work to do.
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000 It's another thing when you, it's going to go into this, but when you are a leader
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000 and things are going bad, give people something to do, give them a direction, give them an order, say,
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000 look, are this what we are going to do right now?
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000 I don't know about that, but there is what we are going to do.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000 We are going to move all these chairs and get them into this, whatever, you figure something to do, and do it.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000 Encounters with the enemy are most terrifying when they are unfamiliar.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000 The soldier becomes used to gunfire to explosions and to the sight and order of death.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000 As the soldier becomes used to gunfire explosions and the sight of older,
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000 the soldier of death, he gradually acquires the power to meet these things more stoically.
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000 He does not actually lose his fear but learns to ignore it sufficiently to keep his attention
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000 only on the business of combat.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000 And if he has in his trained hands a good weapon which he knows will put the enemy out of action.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000 This gives him a feeling of confidence, a sense of power that in large measure our ways is fear.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000 He knows it will soon be the other fellow's turn to be scared.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000 Fear when experienced is intensely uncomfortable and seems often to be incapacitating.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000 If the period of fright is prolonged, a man may feel that his nerves are all shot by it.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000 For fear is disintegrating, demoralizing, it shatters morale.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000 The soldier may be rooted to the spot, paralyzed or immobilized by fear.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000 Nevertheless, such awful moments before an attack, when each second seems an hour,
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000 may actually be useful to any soldier.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000 They may really add to his efficiency.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000 For fear is the body's preparation for action.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000 The heart pounds faster, blood pumping more rapidly to the arms and legs and brain where oxygen is needed.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000 The lungs do their part by quick and breathing.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Blood pressure goes up, adrenaline which is nature's own shot in the arm is poured liberally into the bloodstream.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000 Settle changes in body chemistry automatically affected by powerful emotion.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000 The soldier's nerves protect the soldier in action in ways he would never think of if he had to plan them himself.
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000 His blood clots more readily.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000 He loses temporarily sense of fatigue even though he may have been dog-tired.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:45.000 It is sometimes difficult for a tense fright and soldier to get started into combat to begin the action will relieve his fear.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000 That part is taken care of by army training and discipline.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000 Months of training have taught the soldier to respond from habit to definite battle orders,
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000 even though in battle commands often cannot be given as in training.
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000 It has become second nature to him to carry out his own job as a member of the fighting team.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000 So there you go.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.000 This is also important when you recognize, when you know what's going to happen, it allows you to not be scared that you're scared.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Right? So all of a sudden your breathing starts going faster and you feel the adrenaline going through your system.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000 If you don't know what's happening, it might catch you off guard.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000 But if you know what's happening, well, cool. That's my adrenaline.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000 If you know when you have a, can you feel adrenaline actually go through your system?
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000 Like, let's say you're driving and somebody pulls out in front of you almost crashed into it.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000 Right? And you can, you can feel the adrenaline go down your arms and duets. Are you felt that before?
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000 Oh yeah. So if you don't have any idea what that is.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000 And it happens, you might scare you a little bit.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000 Yes, you know what it is. You're kind of, you're kind of good with it.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000 Yeah, it's like you, it's like people, I mean, I don't know if I don't know the actual process, but you know how like,
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000 yeah, when you tense up before you do something, right? And feel your heart beating all fast and stuff like that.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000 If you know, okay, you know, I'm getting excited because of this, you know, event.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000 That's big in my mind or whatever.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000 But if you're like, if you don't know, or you're like, what I'm losing it, I feel like I'm losing it right now.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000 You know, like if you're, I don't know, you know, if you're about to go skydiving or something different for you obviously,
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000 but the normal person, for the jump out of an airplane, you know?
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000 Yeah, and that's what's a lot of the military training that you go through is to get yourself.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:48.000 Hey, when you, when you start fast-roading, roping out of helicopter, when you're repelling off of the, off of the side of a cliff or out of a window in an urban environment or your parachuting,
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000 static land parachute, free fall parachute. All these things that you do, when you first start doing them,
00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000 there's like an adrenaline rush, but you just get used to it. And so then by the time you're getting shot at,
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000 you're like, oh yeah, I know what this is. I'm good. I can carry on.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000 Yeah.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000 Back to the book, no matter how distracted, you mind may be by unfamiliar,
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000 interrogating sites and smells and sounds, you act from sheer force of habit.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:26.000 In fact, it is habits which take care of a man if he is too frightened to think clearly, like the habit of diving for cover when bombs come down.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000 Then, presently, you are an action. You are a fighting. You are at last using your force against the foe.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:41.000 No more are you a depressed frightened soul. Fierce forgotten provided your well trained.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000 Good to teach people the, how to respond in certain situations. Like you didn't, you know, when he comes to the self defense.
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000 Hey, if you get attacked, here's what happens. Here's what you do. When they just have that plan, that's worth a lot.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000 Just having a plan is worth a lot. So many grabs you here. This is your reaction.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000 So many grabs you there. This is your reaction. You know, those things, they, if you see them out of context, like if you watch a
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000 Gracie self defense video out of context, you'll say, well, it's going to be hard for that particular movie.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000 If you go watch like a Macdojo self defense, then you go, that's just, obviously, that's never going to work.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000 But even you want your Gracie self defense thing out of context, you don't understand it. You might be like, well, I don't know how that's going to work.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:34.000 But it's a plan that you're going to take action. And it isn't effective plan, by the way. It's not like it's not a good plan.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000 But the fact that you are going to immediately take action, you're going to respond to the event immediately.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.000 It's going to put you in a totally different place. And a much, much infinitely better place than I just got, you know, someone just grabbed me by
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:58.000 the head or by the arm. And I have no idea what to do. That's a bad situation. Then that fear is going to rise. If you have a reaction, boom, you're going to action.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000 And then the, he talks about like training right, if you, you know, the well trained person. It's like you're just so, because training is just like repetition.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Right, all these different scenarios. So you're so used to it. It's like nothing. You're so like used to this stimulus or, okay, remember when you're in elementary school, they do a fire drill.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000 Every whatever they do. And you just calmly stand up and walk out and sing, well, by all I, you know, it's like it's kind of boring in a way.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:35.000 But I mean, we never had a fire in my elementary school, but I'm imagining that if the, once you heard, it was a certain spuse, a specific bell that went on.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000 It instead of the regular bell, it would go ding ding ding ding.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:49.000 It was obviously a fire drill, you know, when you heard the bell. So it was so ingrained in, well, in me, anyway, I'm sure everyone else felt the same way as a kid.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:58.000 When you heard that, you were like, you just sort of automatically like a zombie stand up and why not, like, you know, it was almost like, yeah, it's like so automatic.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000 So I'm assuming that like, if a fire actually happened,
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:14.000 you're instinct would be to do it. Just do it. Yeah, normally, you would have run and scatter and be all crazy, whatever you just because you're so quote unquote trained just to do it, you know, completely.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000 I guarantee if you look back in the history of school fires,
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000 at some point there was a school fire before they did that training and everyone panicked and freaked out and people died.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.000 Yeah, maybe people didn't die, but people said, oh, that could have gone bad. And so then, oh, guess what you do, you rehearse it, you trained this bell means stand up, moving the direction, go out this door,
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000 assemble in the recess area for ad count. Yeah. In fact, they're remembering college, someone pulled the fire alarm.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:47.000 Mm-hmm. It was, it ended up to be a prank, but everyone sort of thought that, oh, this building is on fire right now, this is in the middle of the night.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000 I don't think I've ever believed a fire alarm.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:07.000 And I'm trying to think, if, no way, I've been in one situation where there was a legit fire, but I was like completely, everyone just thought I was super cool and calm, but I was actually just did it.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000 And then finally, I was, yeah, we need to get out of here.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:18.000 Yeah. But, yeah, most, because you think about, I've experienced a lot of fire alarms and there's a very low percentage of them that were real fires.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000 Yeah. Yeah. And that's, well, I mean, I guess that's an added element though. Like if, if you're trained, but you never think it'll ever ever happen.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000 I don't know, I think I would think that'd be a little bit different, because almost like you run the risk of when it actually does happen and you smell smoke or see the smoke or see the flames or whatever, that might
00:53:38.000 --> 00:54:07.000 you do some added element that you weren't expecting. You know? Yeah. So that might jam you up. But nonetheless, I think, like when you go through, I remember there was a fire, but it was like way and a different building and it was just procedure, everyone, I evacuated, you know, kind of thing, and we found out it was just later or whatever. So yeah, I don't think I ever had the stimulus of the fire, but in college or whatever, when I did think that it was on fire, I didn't hear it or I mean,
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.74 here it or I mean I didn't smell it or see it or nothing like that.
00:54:09.74 --> 00:54:10.58 That's what I was looking at.
00:54:10.58 --> 00:54:14.02 I thought obviously we're in no threat.
00:54:14.02 --> 00:54:16.06 Yeah, because if there's no fire around you,
00:54:16.06 --> 00:54:17.62 then you think that time to get out.
00:54:17.62 --> 00:54:18.46 Yeah.
00:54:18.46 --> 00:54:21.18 But it was still the same like, no one was panicking.
00:54:21.18 --> 00:54:22.02 It seemed like it.
00:54:22.02 --> 00:54:22.86 It seemed like it.
00:54:22.86 --> 00:54:24.34 But I'm just saying there's no,
00:54:24.34 --> 00:54:26.82 there's no like what we're talking about here,
00:54:26.82 --> 00:54:30.26 there's no incentive to run because it's just the alarm
00:54:30.26 --> 00:54:32.06 and you fall the procedure.
00:54:32.06 --> 00:54:33.06 Yeah.
00:54:33.06 --> 00:54:33.90 Well, yeah.
00:54:33.90 --> 00:54:37.66 And then if you let's say you're just lining up in a single file
00:54:37.66 --> 00:54:41.24 line calmly because you're supposed to do it calmly,
00:54:41.24 --> 00:54:45.30 meanwhile the guy behind you is like choking and getting
00:54:45.30 --> 00:54:47.46 his shirts on fire.
00:54:47.46 --> 00:54:50.82 Right, you're gonna run straight up.
00:54:50.82 --> 00:54:53.42 I might try and help him actually.
00:54:53.42 --> 00:54:55.42 Give me a little stop drop.
00:54:55.42 --> 00:54:56.42 So drop in the road.
00:54:56.42 --> 00:54:57.22 It's old school year.
00:54:57.22 --> 00:54:58.10 It's been helping out.
00:54:58.10 --> 00:54:59.10 Yeah.
00:54:59.10 --> 00:55:01.70 Well, I'd throw the paint fire.
00:55:01.70 --> 00:55:03.90 Good play.
00:55:03.90 --> 00:55:04.90 All right.
00:55:04.90 --> 00:55:06.50 Goes into some specifics here.
00:55:06.50 --> 00:55:07.90 How to fight fear.
00:55:07.90 --> 00:55:10.90 One action dispels fear do something.
00:55:10.90 --> 00:55:13.46 And the time is suspense when men are already
00:55:13.46 --> 00:55:15.26 for action, but are waiting for the signal start.
00:55:15.26 --> 00:55:17.30 Fear is at its height.
00:55:17.30 --> 00:55:19.22 If the period of waiting is prolonged,
00:55:19.22 --> 00:55:22.10 perhaps delay until a weather changes,
00:55:22.10 --> 00:55:24.94 the time should be occupied with preparation for action.
00:55:24.94 --> 00:55:29.30 Fight fear with necessary or main, you factured work.
00:55:29.30 --> 00:55:33.22 And when expecting combat when waiting for enemy bombers to return,
00:55:33.22 --> 00:55:35.18 man you factured work.
00:55:35.18 --> 00:55:38.30 Like, hey, you gotta make something up for people to do.
00:55:38.30 --> 00:55:39.30 Seems lazy.
00:55:39.30 --> 00:55:40.70 Seems yeah.
00:55:40.70 --> 00:55:41.78 And it's not hard.
00:55:41.78 --> 00:55:43.58 In combat, there's always something to get ready.
00:55:43.58 --> 00:55:45.90 So it's not hard to say, all right, what we're gonna do
00:55:45.90 --> 00:55:47.86 is we're gonna set up a couple other bunkers.
00:55:47.86 --> 00:55:48.74 Let's fill some sandbags.
00:55:48.74 --> 00:55:49.58 Cool.
00:55:49.58 --> 00:55:50.70 We're all working.
00:55:50.70 --> 00:55:51.54 There's always a reason.
00:55:51.54 --> 00:55:53.06 It doesn't even have to be manufactured.
00:55:53.06 --> 00:55:54.38 It can be real.
00:55:54.38 --> 00:55:57.34 Two physical contact with friends, helps.
00:55:57.34 --> 00:55:59.50 Men shoot if at all possible stay within sight
00:55:59.50 --> 00:56:01.82 of in time of peril, but not bunched up
00:56:01.82 --> 00:56:03.90 enough to become a bomb target.
00:56:03.90 --> 00:56:06.70 Just the presence of another man not far off with no
00:56:06.70 --> 00:56:09.06 when no word is spoken minimizes fear.
00:56:09.06 --> 00:56:11.38 Three role calls help men in peril
00:56:11.38 --> 00:56:13.42 should be reminded that they are not alone.
00:56:14.42 --> 00:56:17.02 Four knowledge is power over fear.
00:56:17.02 --> 00:56:19.26 Surprises the most important element in battle,
00:56:19.26 --> 00:56:22.30 thus men should be constantly kept informed
00:56:22.30 --> 00:56:24.50 of the dangers they may meet.
00:56:25.54 --> 00:56:27.30 That one could be a little bit of a trick.
00:56:27.30 --> 00:56:31.42 You work you on because sometimes people would get
00:56:31.42 --> 00:56:34.62 a little freaked out when they would hear
00:56:34.62 --> 00:56:36.58 about what the enemy can do.
00:56:36.58 --> 00:56:37.98 You know what I'm saying?
00:56:37.98 --> 00:56:40.26 Like I'll tell you one thing, when we were in
00:56:40.26 --> 00:56:44.50 Ramadi, there was a lot of ideas, a lot of ideas.
00:56:44.50 --> 00:56:47.62 And if someone would come to visit us,
00:56:48.62 --> 00:56:51.94 and they wanted to come on an operation with us,
00:56:51.94 --> 00:56:55.06 we would give like the slightly longer IED brief
00:56:55.06 --> 00:56:58.34 so that they understood the threat.
00:56:58.34 --> 00:57:00.98 It wasn't always helpful for them psychologically.
00:57:00.98 --> 00:57:04.34 You could see as the brief went on,
00:57:04.34 --> 00:57:07.38 you could see I would watch the reactions on people's faces
00:57:07.38 --> 00:57:10.02 and you could see them start getting really concerned.
00:57:10.02 --> 00:57:13.46 Because it's just my EOD guy standing out.
00:57:13.46 --> 00:57:16.90 Here's the bomb from this vehicle, yesterday,
00:57:16.90 --> 00:57:18.42 this is what it did to the vehicle day before.
00:57:18.42 --> 00:57:19.78 Here's what it looked like.
00:57:19.78 --> 00:57:20.66 Here's one that they found.
00:57:20.66 --> 00:57:21.62 Here's one that they did.
00:57:21.62 --> 00:57:24.18 And it was just a slide show of bombs.
00:57:24.18 --> 00:57:25.62 Yeah.
00:57:25.62 --> 00:57:27.94 In the city that you're about to go into,
00:57:27.94 --> 00:57:31.46 which is not a big city, it's two miles, three miles across.
00:57:31.46 --> 00:57:33.78 It's not like we're going, and there's a small chance.
00:57:33.78 --> 00:57:36.90 And by the way, there's seven to 10 IEDs detonated a day
00:57:36.90 --> 00:57:39.62 on route Michigan one road going across Ramadi.
00:57:39.62 --> 00:57:44.58 So it was when you tell when people would come to Ramadi
00:57:44.58 --> 00:57:47.86 and they'd get that brief, it would always be sort of an interesting
00:57:47.86 --> 00:57:48.98 look on their face.
00:57:48.98 --> 00:57:53.62 I would see people tap in their toe, shake in their leg.
00:57:53.62 --> 00:57:54.66 You know what I'm saying?
00:57:54.66 --> 00:57:55.66 You know what I'm saying?
00:57:55.66 --> 00:57:59.38 I would watch for that and I'd see people just getting all nervous.
00:57:59.38 --> 00:58:00.82 Because hey, it's a real thing.
00:58:00.82 --> 00:58:02.34 I mean, I get it.
00:58:02.34 --> 00:58:06.74 But the guys from TU Bruiser were kind of adjusted to it.
00:58:06.74 --> 00:58:10.26 You know, they were adjusted to it.
00:58:10.26 --> 00:58:11.62 Back to the book.
00:58:11.62 --> 00:58:12.98 Control of action helps.
00:58:12.98 --> 00:58:16.34 To be afraid does not mean that a man must act afraid.
00:58:16.34 --> 00:58:17.94 Oh, this one's so good.
00:58:17.94 --> 00:58:23.06 To be afraid does not mean that a man must act afraid.
00:58:23.06 --> 00:58:26.42 Fear is contagious when it is expressed in action.
00:58:26.42 --> 00:58:29.14 If a man goes to pieces and becomes panicky,
00:58:29.14 --> 00:58:31.62 he must be removed from the sight of other men if that is
00:58:31.62 --> 00:58:32.66 all possible.
00:58:32.66 --> 00:58:37.46 It is each man's responsibility to control the signs of his own fear
00:58:37.46 --> 00:58:41.62 if he can so as to spare the others.
00:58:41.62 --> 00:58:45.06 If he can manage to act as though he were calm,
00:58:45.06 --> 00:58:48.74 he may actually become more calm.
00:58:48.74 --> 00:58:51.46 At any rate, the opposite of true is true,
00:58:51.46 --> 00:58:53.62 giving him the fear tends to increase it.
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:01.22 There you go.
00:59:01.22 --> 00:59:03.30 It's straightforward.
00:59:03.30 --> 00:59:06.74 Don't be shaking your leg during the brief.
00:59:06.74 --> 00:59:06.98 Yeah.
00:59:06.98 --> 00:59:07.86 You know what I'm saying?
00:59:07.86 --> 00:59:09.94 Don't show that you're scared.
00:59:09.94 --> 00:59:12.66 Because that gets contagious and other people will start
00:59:12.66 --> 00:59:13.54 feeling like you're afraid.
00:59:13.54 --> 00:59:15.70 You got to act like no factor.
00:59:15.70 --> 00:59:16.42 Whatever.
00:59:16.42 --> 00:59:18.34 You think they can blow me up, bring it.
00:59:18.34 --> 00:59:19.14 Yeah.
00:59:19.14 --> 00:59:21.14 Bring it.
00:59:21.14 --> 00:59:24.18 You can't be panicking and freaking out.
00:59:25.54 --> 00:59:30.34 And each man is responsible to keep themselves in check,
00:59:30.34 --> 00:59:31.54 keep their fear in check.
00:59:31.54 --> 00:59:33.78 And just because your afraid doesn't mean you get to act like it.
00:59:33.78 --> 00:59:35.22 Yeah.
00:59:35.22 --> 00:59:36.18 Is that kind of like one?
00:59:36.18 --> 00:59:37.78 When your kids get older, well,
00:59:37.78 --> 00:59:40.18 when your kids get older, you have to have that conversation with them.
00:59:40.18 --> 00:59:41.22 No, have that conversation.
00:59:41.22 --> 00:59:43.46 You don't get to act like you're scared.
00:59:43.46 --> 00:59:44.66 You don't even get to act like you're mad.
00:59:44.66 --> 00:59:46.02 That's why we play normal face.
00:59:46.02 --> 00:59:46.42 Right.
00:59:46.42 --> 00:59:47.78 You don't get to act like that.
00:59:48.58 --> 00:59:50.26 You think you're going to get hit in the head with this thing,
00:59:50.26 --> 00:59:51.70 and you can go deal with it.
00:59:51.70 --> 00:59:52.18 Yeah.
00:59:52.18 --> 00:59:52.98 Put it on the inside.
00:59:52.98 --> 00:59:56.74 You know, like when your kids, when they're young,
00:59:56.74 --> 00:59:59.06 and they fall down, right?
00:59:59.06 --> 01:00:01.06 You're kid, you saw, yeah, daughter, whatever.
01:00:01.06 --> 01:00:01.86 They fall down.
01:00:01.86 --> 01:00:02.66 Best thing you can do.
01:00:02.66 --> 01:00:03.06 Right.
01:00:03.06 --> 01:00:03.86 Laugh out of them.
01:00:03.86 --> 01:00:04.66 Or yes.
01:00:04.66 --> 01:00:06.34 And it's funny because it's like,
01:00:06.34 --> 01:00:07.30 That's awesome.
01:00:07.30 --> 01:00:09.46 Yeah, that's a one that I do.
01:00:09.46 --> 01:00:10.66 Yeah.
01:00:10.66 --> 01:00:13.46 But there's that split second when they fall,
01:00:13.46 --> 01:00:14.66 they're stunned.
01:00:14.66 --> 01:00:15.46 They're shocked.
01:00:15.46 --> 01:00:18.34 And they look at you with like, how am I supposed to act?
01:00:18.34 --> 01:00:18.98 I'm afraid.
01:00:18.98 --> 01:00:22.02 So if you're like, oh my god, run up to him.
01:00:22.02 --> 01:00:22.98 Oh my gosh, are you okay?
01:00:22.98 --> 01:00:23.86 I think it's okay.
01:00:23.86 --> 01:00:26.42 Every time that noise that you just made,
01:00:26.42 --> 01:00:27.62 Yeah.
01:00:27.62 --> 01:00:32.42 is my wife is the absolute greatest at this noise.
01:00:32.42 --> 01:00:33.46 Oh.
01:00:34.58 --> 01:00:36.42 She can make a grown person.
01:00:36.42 --> 01:00:37.06 Yeah.
01:00:37.06 --> 01:00:39.78 Make you think that you should start crying and freaking out.
01:00:39.78 --> 01:00:40.10 Oh, yeah.
01:00:40.10 --> 01:00:41.78 Because she just gives the.
01:00:41.78 --> 01:00:42.98 Oh, yeah.
01:00:42.98 --> 01:00:43.38 Yeah.
01:00:43.38 --> 01:00:44.18 Yeah.
01:00:44.18 --> 01:00:45.62 He's got a lot of, yeah.
01:00:45.62 --> 01:00:47.22 She caused a so much alarm.
01:00:47.22 --> 01:00:47.62 Yeah.
01:00:47.62 --> 01:00:50.98 I've been married to her for over 20 years.
01:00:50.98 --> 01:00:51.78 Yeah.
01:00:51.78 --> 01:00:53.30 And we'll be driving.
01:00:53.30 --> 01:00:55.54 Oh, just just spend time to get it.
01:00:55.54 --> 01:00:56.66 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:00:56.66 --> 01:01:00.02 We're not, we're not talking like a rainstorm on the highway.
01:01:00.02 --> 01:01:01.62 Going 60 miles an hour.
01:01:01.62 --> 01:01:05.62 We're talking just cruising just through like a normal area.
01:01:06.90 --> 01:01:10.02 And I'll just be, you know, relax, thinking,
01:01:10.02 --> 01:01:11.94 train attention, all of a sudden.
01:01:11.94 --> 01:01:16.10 And you know what she'll say at the end of it?
01:01:16.10 --> 01:01:18.58 She'll go, look at that.
01:01:19.46 --> 01:01:20.50 All over there.
01:01:20.50 --> 01:01:22.34 It's got such a cool thing.
01:01:22.34 --> 01:01:24.02 And I'm thinking, you know,
01:01:24.02 --> 01:01:25.14 you know, can you?
01:01:25.14 --> 01:01:26.50 No, I've been telling her not to do this.
01:01:26.50 --> 01:01:28.34 But it's an instinct that she has.
01:01:28.34 --> 01:01:28.66 Yeah.
01:01:28.66 --> 01:01:30.90 It's an instinct that my wife has.
01:01:30.90 --> 01:01:31.22 Yeah.
01:01:31.22 --> 01:01:32.50 I think this.
01:01:32.50 --> 01:01:36.26 And it's, and now, you know, my son doing his driving.
01:01:36.26 --> 01:01:37.94 Like he got his license.
01:01:37.94 --> 01:01:38.90 So he can drive.
01:01:38.90 --> 01:01:39.54 Oh.
01:01:39.54 --> 01:01:40.82 And he came home the other day.
01:01:40.82 --> 01:01:42.74 He's like, man, he's a dad.
01:01:43.86 --> 01:01:44.90 I'm driving with mom.
01:01:44.90 --> 01:01:46.02 It's kind of scary.
01:01:46.02 --> 01:01:48.58 And I'm like, why would it she do?
01:01:48.58 --> 01:01:49.86 I was thinking she was driving.
01:01:49.86 --> 01:01:51.62 He was no I was driving.
01:01:51.62 --> 01:01:55.94 But I drove by like a road.
01:01:55.94 --> 01:01:56.58 Mm.
01:01:56.58 --> 01:01:57.38 And she was.
01:01:57.38 --> 01:01:58.42 Yeah.
01:01:58.42 --> 01:01:59.62 Can you get that tense?
01:01:59.62 --> 01:02:00.42 Yeah.
01:02:00.42 --> 01:02:01.06 Oh, yeah.
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:02.26 Don't act scared.
01:02:02.26 --> 01:02:03.06 Don't do it.
01:02:03.06 --> 01:02:07.06 And for some reason, my wife's, that's an emotional noise
01:02:07.06 --> 01:02:07.62 that she makes.
01:02:07.62 --> 01:02:08.42 It's not fear.
01:02:08.42 --> 01:02:09.62 It's like excitement.
01:02:09.62 --> 01:02:10.90 It's like, yeah, it's everything.
01:02:10.90 --> 01:02:14.18 Sometimes it's like, I see something cute too.
01:02:14.18 --> 01:02:16.18 You know, just something that's not even me.
01:02:16.18 --> 01:02:18.42 I see some, why would you do this?
01:02:18.42 --> 01:02:20.26 If you see something cute, why would you go,
01:02:20.26 --> 01:02:22.82 I don't do that noise.
01:02:22.82 --> 01:02:24.02 That's a wrong noise.
01:02:24.02 --> 01:02:27.62 That noise means I'm about to get in brace for impact.
01:02:27.62 --> 01:02:29.14 That's what that noise means.
01:02:29.14 --> 01:02:32.10 Um, noise means I'm about to get tea bone.
01:02:32.10 --> 01:02:32.74 Yeah.
01:02:32.74 --> 01:02:35.70 And I have a split second to accelerate out of the kill zone.
01:02:35.70 --> 01:02:36.10 Yeah.
01:02:36.10 --> 01:02:37.30 That's what that noise means.
01:02:37.30 --> 01:02:40.50 It doesn't mean book it that cat.
01:02:42.50 --> 01:02:43.38 Stop it.
01:02:43.38 --> 01:02:44.66 Well, man, please.
01:02:44.66 --> 01:02:45.46 Yeah.
01:02:45.46 --> 01:02:48.26 And I don't know if that's a wife thing or what?
01:02:48.26 --> 01:02:50.34 Because my wife is the same thing the same way.
01:02:50.34 --> 01:02:54.90 And it actually is exactly what this book said where you get like act
01:02:54.90 --> 01:02:57.54 scared because it'll cause other sex scared essentially, right?
01:02:57.54 --> 01:03:00.02 No, in do Span Aquedever, which because that's what it did.
01:03:00.02 --> 01:03:01.38 That's what you're like for sure.
01:03:01.38 --> 01:03:02.02 Yeah, for sure.
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:05.54 That's what my wife does to me, which is like on the computer.
01:03:05.54 --> 01:03:07.14 And she's like, oh, I'm like, look at her.
01:03:07.14 --> 01:03:08.18 I'm like, oh, what's that like?
01:03:08.18 --> 01:03:09.14 It's a crazy thing.
01:03:09.14 --> 01:03:10.66 Yeah, or so clearly, we're all about to die.
01:03:10.66 --> 01:03:11.70 I'm going to X 15 seconds.
01:03:11.70 --> 01:03:12.98 Because we just made that noise.
01:03:12.98 --> 01:03:14.10 Exactly, right.
01:03:14.10 --> 01:03:16.02 And that's kind of what goes on for a split second.
01:03:16.02 --> 01:03:18.42 I wonder because I should have been able to
01:03:18.42 --> 01:03:19.62 deprogram myself.
01:03:19.62 --> 01:03:22.18 And I have a little, have a little bit, but it's not full.
01:03:22.18 --> 01:03:23.62 It's not a full deprogram when I hear it.
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:28.58 I still think imminent threat is within 14 seconds of impact.
01:03:28.58 --> 01:03:29.14 Yeah.
01:03:29.14 --> 01:03:30.58 And if not three seconds.
01:03:30.58 --> 01:03:32.74 Well, yeah, especially when it's out of nowhere like that.
01:03:32.74 --> 01:03:34.10 Oh, it's totally out of the list.
01:03:34.10 --> 01:03:34.98 You know, we're just driving.
01:03:34.98 --> 01:03:35.94 It's a sunny day, everything.
01:03:39.94 --> 01:03:40.98 So bad.
01:03:40.98 --> 01:03:42.90 Don't make that noise unless you're
01:03:42.90 --> 01:03:45.70 a, unless you see a person with a machete,
01:03:45.70 --> 01:03:47.54 and it's in the striking position,
01:03:47.54 --> 01:03:48.50 they'll make that noise.
01:03:48.50 --> 01:03:49.54 Because that's what I think.
01:03:49.54 --> 01:03:53.14 I think I think Freddy Krueger's with me
01:03:53.14 --> 01:03:54.34 with a, with a, with a, with a,
01:03:54.34 --> 01:03:56.74 battle axe getting ready to take my head off.
01:03:56.74 --> 01:03:59.30 Uh, no, I don't think he'd have a, a battle axe.
01:03:59.30 --> 01:04:00.74 No, he had them weird fingers.
01:04:00.74 --> 01:04:02.82 Yeah, yeah, the nice, some of the fingers.
01:04:02.82 --> 01:04:05.46 But yeah, dang, that's, yeah, good advice.
01:04:05.46 --> 01:04:08.82 100% you can't, I don't know how much you can train yourself
01:04:08.82 --> 01:04:09.54 with that though.
01:04:09.54 --> 01:04:10.34 That's no, no.
01:04:10.34 --> 01:04:13.86 And then, I think that's a, I think that's a genetic
01:04:13.86 --> 01:04:17.46 programmed noise that heightens the reaction.
01:04:17.46 --> 01:04:17.78 What?
01:04:17.78 --> 01:04:19.94 And prepares you for combat situations.
01:04:19.94 --> 01:04:22.02 Yeah, because there's like some reason it's more
01:04:22.02 --> 01:04:24.90 up into this thing where it can also be triggered
01:04:24.90 --> 01:04:30.10 to make that noise by a cute cat on the, you know, whatever.
01:04:30.10 --> 01:04:33.86 Yeah, or like, maybe she forgot something.
01:04:33.86 --> 01:04:35.62 You know, oh, yeah, that's another one.
01:04:35.62 --> 01:04:39.30 I forgot to tell you, like, you know, our friends
01:04:39.30 --> 01:04:41.86 are having a baby or something like this, you know?
01:04:41.86 --> 01:04:42.82 No, I want to be that.
01:04:42.82 --> 01:04:46.74 It'll be like, I forgot to tell you, I got Billy
01:04:46.74 --> 01:04:49.94 coming over for you to work on, you know, yard,
01:04:49.94 --> 01:04:51.38 yeah, sprinkler.
01:04:51.38 --> 01:04:52.26 Yeah, okay, cool.
01:04:52.26 --> 01:04:52.74 Thanks.
01:04:52.74 --> 01:04:54.90 Now that my adrenaline is through the real bad.
01:04:54.90 --> 01:04:55.54 That's gonna be out.
01:04:55.54 --> 01:04:56.74 Yeah.
01:04:56.74 --> 01:04:57.54 Yeah.
01:04:57.54 --> 01:05:00.02 Check.
01:05:00.02 --> 01:05:00.74 Back to the book.
01:05:00.74 --> 01:05:02.98 There's another kind of fear that must be endured
01:05:02.98 --> 01:05:06.74 for days and weeks, perhaps months or years.
01:05:06.74 --> 01:05:11.46 If men are besieged, cut off from help, deprived of inadequate
01:05:11.46 --> 01:05:14.58 deprived of adequate defense, then the ever present
01:05:14.58 --> 01:05:17.86 peril from the enemy may be aggravated by the greater
01:05:17.86 --> 01:05:20.42 peril of disease, famine, exposure.
01:05:21.54 --> 01:05:24.10 And there may be little chance for action.
01:05:24.90 --> 01:05:28.50 Men in the present war have endured primitive sorts of hardships
01:05:28.50 --> 01:05:32.74 that would seem to be beyond human endurance in baton,
01:05:32.74 --> 01:05:35.94 on correct or alone on a rubber life raft
01:05:35.94 --> 01:05:40.18 for five weeks and blistering sun and drenching storm
01:05:40.18 --> 01:05:43.70 without food, without shelter, without water, without any aid,
01:05:43.70 --> 01:05:48.58 but their own unquenchable spirit, their fortitude and their faith.
01:05:50.02 --> 01:05:52.34 This means terror mixed with despair.
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:54.98 The misery cannot be relieved.
01:05:54.98 --> 01:05:56.90 It can only be endured.
01:05:56.90 --> 01:06:00.74 Then they must maintain sanity, courage, and life itself
01:06:00.74 --> 01:06:05.38 by their ingenuity in originating occupations for hands and minds
01:06:05.38 --> 01:06:09.54 that we're relieved the tension and seem to reduce the hazards.
01:06:09.54 --> 01:06:12.82 And this is the kind of stuff that Captain Plum talked about.
01:06:12.82 --> 01:06:14.66 It's figuring out stuff to do.
01:06:14.66 --> 01:06:17.46 Like, just we're going to figure out stuff to do,
01:06:17.46 --> 01:06:19.06 whether it's...
01:06:19.06 --> 01:06:24.34 whether it's make teacher self-colligraphy by making an earwax
01:06:24.34 --> 01:06:30.90 a rich sketch or whatever.
01:06:30.90 --> 01:06:34.34 I mean, those guys figured out things to do.
01:06:34.34 --> 01:06:37.06 Back to the book and such trying times and intense moments,
01:06:37.06 --> 01:06:38.66 a laugh can be a lifesaver.
01:06:38.66 --> 01:06:41.22 An army officer relating experience of the World War,
01:06:41.22 --> 01:06:43.94 that's the first World War, tells of a time when badly frightened,
01:06:43.94 --> 01:06:47.46 untrained soldiers of that war had taken refuge in a roadside ditch
01:06:47.46 --> 01:06:51.78 against an unsfreshing horror, the fire of American guns
01:06:51.78 --> 01:06:53.62 turned on them by mistake.
01:06:53.62 --> 01:06:57.94 Pan-accent the blood pounding into my head and emptied my stomach of courage.
01:06:57.94 --> 01:07:00.66 It was bad enough to be shot at by the boge,
01:07:00.66 --> 01:07:04.58 but there was no sense in being killed by friendly troops.
01:07:04.58 --> 01:07:06.82 My men looked wild and fingered their triggers
01:07:06.82 --> 01:07:10.34 ready to return fire of our other battalion.
01:07:11.38 --> 01:07:13.38 Something had to be done and done quick,
01:07:13.38 --> 01:07:16.50 and Captain Wast did it unintentionally, but he still did it.
01:07:16.50 --> 01:07:20.50 Jackson, he yelled, yes, Captain, where are you?
01:07:20.50 --> 01:07:23.70 Right here, across the road, stand up so I can see you.
01:07:23.70 --> 01:07:28.26 Captain Jackson shouted above the crackling roar of machine gun bullets.
01:07:28.26 --> 01:07:32.02 If you want to see me, you stand up.
01:07:33.06 --> 01:07:35.30 American humor can lick anything.
01:07:35.30 --> 01:07:38.90 The smothered chuckles ran down the line, orders were given and listened to.
01:07:38.90 --> 01:07:41.70 Men wriggled backwards out of the zone of fire.
01:07:41.70 --> 01:07:44.66 The first to reach the trees dash down the line of third battalion,
01:07:44.66 --> 01:07:45.94 shutting off the guns.
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:48.90 So you're gonna hear jokes like that, and it is helpful.
01:07:51.06 --> 01:07:55.30 Continuing the soldier who deliberately chooses to be blown up in order to wipe out an
01:07:55.30 --> 01:07:59.46 enemy tank or machine gun nest that would have otherwise cost the lives of his friends
01:07:59.46 --> 01:08:03.70 as ideals, has indeed all it takes to make a soldier.
01:08:03.70 --> 01:08:08.26 The commander of a ship who coole sends away the last lifeboat and goes down with his vessel
01:08:08.26 --> 01:08:12.82 rather than abandon it while some of his men are helplessly imprisoned in one of its compartments
01:08:12.82 --> 01:08:17.22 is afraid, but governed by something more powerful than fear.
01:08:19.78 --> 01:08:22.02 That's a good statement, isn't it?
01:08:22.02 --> 01:08:25.22 Governance, do you have over your own emotions?
01:08:25.22 --> 01:08:39.38 You may call this force idealism, conscience, religion, philosophy, tradition, code, or even habit.
01:08:39.38 --> 01:08:43.14 Or you may be modern in call it ideology.
01:08:43.14 --> 01:08:48.50 Psychologists sometimes call it the triumph of the social over the selfish instincts.
01:08:48.50 --> 01:08:52.66 To recognize this force as the most potent weapon an army can possess,
01:08:52.66 --> 01:08:57.06 men fighting for their homes and armed with this spirit can stand their ground and win against
01:08:57.06 --> 01:08:58.90 tremendous opposing forces.
01:09:01.86 --> 01:09:06.74 Next section, why men fight lower animals fight from a variety of causes?
01:09:06.74 --> 01:09:11.78 Some fight because as be surprised, they live by killing and devouring animals may fight their
01:09:11.78 --> 01:09:14.34 own kind and a tossle over mate.
01:09:14.34 --> 01:09:17.94 They fight to defend their young, their homes, or their own lives.
01:09:17.94 --> 01:09:22.90 Some are aggressive and go about seeking what they may devour, others fight as a last resort
01:09:22.90 --> 01:09:24.42 when they are cornered.
01:09:24.42 --> 01:09:29.86 Men being too legant animals may fight for any or all of these reasons.
01:09:29.86 --> 01:09:35.06 But because they have minds capable of being moved by abstract ideas such as honor, glory,
01:09:35.06 --> 01:09:41.06 freedom, sympathy, justice, and patriotism, men also fight for what they believe to be right.
01:09:41.06 --> 01:09:47.62 Greater than a fear of injury and death, Napoleon said, is the fear of shame.
01:09:50.90 --> 01:09:56.50 Before a drafted man throws himself wholeheartedly into his work as a soldier before the civilian
01:09:56.50 --> 01:10:01.70 makes up his mind to enlist in the army, he is stirred by, he is stirred in influence by one or
01:10:01.70 --> 01:10:03.94 perhaps many of the following forces.
01:10:05.14 --> 01:10:06.90 He may be carried away by men.
01:10:06.90 --> 01:10:11.22 This is just laying out why people are in the army and this is important to understand if
01:10:11.22 --> 01:10:14.42 you are a leader of a bunch of people in the army, then you have to understand how they ended
01:10:14.42 --> 01:10:15.42 up there.
01:10:15.42 --> 01:10:18.10 If you are in charge of a company, you have to understand how people ended up in a position
01:10:18.10 --> 01:10:19.42 where they are working for you.
01:10:19.42 --> 01:10:20.42 Why are they there?
01:10:20.42 --> 01:10:22.70 How do they end up there?
01:10:22.70 --> 01:10:25.26 He breaks it down for people that join the army.
01:10:25.26 --> 01:10:31.30 One, he may be carried away by mass suggestion and infectious, martial spirit spreads through
01:10:31.30 --> 01:10:35.62 the community, roused by government officials, speakers, writers, flags, or waving bands
01:10:35.62 --> 01:10:37.62 or playing drums or beating and crowds of cheering.
01:10:37.62 --> 01:10:44.66 Boom, to he may become involved in a wave of war and hysteria, like the furvernal of martial
01:10:44.66 --> 01:10:50.74 spirit, war hate is infectious, men rush to arms at news of the enemy's evil designs or
01:10:50.74 --> 01:10:55.14 brutality of a treacherous assault or intended invasion.
01:10:55.14 --> 01:11:00.54 Three, he may be urged on by strong spirit of adventure.
01:11:00.54 --> 01:11:05.98 For the ambitious self-centered man, especially perhaps if he has been unable to achieve
01:11:05.98 --> 01:11:13.06 success in civilian life may see war as an opportunity to gain personal glory and power.
01:11:13.06 --> 01:11:17.18 Five, he may be driven by his own combativeness.
01:11:17.18 --> 01:11:22.10 Some men delight in fighting for its own sake, some may even be killers at heart, because
01:11:22.10 --> 01:11:27.22 murder is outlawed in civilian life and because many circles even taking a poke in a man
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:32.50 or cursing him freely is frowned upon, some combat of men may find their first thrill of
01:11:32.50 --> 01:11:36.46 releasing an attack on the enemy.
01:11:36.46 --> 01:11:42.50 Six, he may be unconsciously trying to relieve a grouch by violence that is considered
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:43.70 legitimate.
01:11:43.70 --> 01:11:47.50 The man who has spent a lifetime enduring unending series of disappointments, failures
01:11:47.50 --> 01:11:53.50 and obstacles, and who has dammed up in himself, over-eVER mounting grievances and resentment
01:11:53.50 --> 01:11:58.50 may be able to turn all that ill will against the enemy.
01:11:58.50 --> 01:12:02.50 Seven, he may have joined the army as he would apply for a job.
01:12:02.50 --> 01:12:06.86 Think about the stark difference between those couple there who got one person that just
01:12:06.86 --> 01:12:09.94 wants to fight people or one person that feels like they've been a failure and everything
01:12:09.94 --> 01:12:14.62 and just has an opportunity to take that grudge against the world.
01:12:14.62 --> 01:12:17.50 I'm a murderer at heart and you got another guy that, hey I joined, because this is
01:12:17.50 --> 01:12:18.50 okay.
01:12:18.50 --> 01:12:19.50 Seems like a good job.
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:21.50 They could pay me a GI bill or whatever.
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.50 They're not there.
01:12:23.50 --> 01:12:27.94 Hey, he may have been driven into army life by regard for public opinion.
01:12:27.94 --> 01:12:34.34 He may feel keenly the way his friends, especially the girls, regard a military uniform
01:12:34.34 --> 01:12:36.22 and a fighting man.
01:12:36.22 --> 01:12:40.10 He may hate the thought of being considered a slacker.
01:12:40.10 --> 01:12:45.70 Nine, it may be his desire to maintain his own self-esteem that moves him.
01:12:45.70 --> 01:12:51.94 He may have to end his secret shame at the thought that others are doing the fighting
01:12:51.94 --> 01:12:52.94 for him.
01:12:52.94 --> 01:12:58.74 Ten, his action may be based on a feeling of oneness with the nation and on faith in the
01:12:58.74 --> 01:13:00.74 leaders and the nation's leaders.
01:13:00.74 --> 01:13:03.94 Eleven, he might be acting out of his faith in democracy.
01:13:03.94 --> 01:13:08.50 Twelve, he might be compelled by his spirit of sacrifice.
01:13:08.50 --> 01:13:13.10 All these reasons why men join the army, why they accept training in many cases, why
01:13:13.10 --> 01:13:21.54 they keep on willingly, willingly when they go on overseas to a fighting front.
01:13:21.54 --> 01:13:27.02 Yet by the motives, by then the motives usually change or some of them do and hear the
01:13:27.02 --> 01:13:31.74 chief reasons why a man fights at the front.
01:13:31.74 --> 01:13:32.90 So there's a little difference here.
01:13:32.90 --> 01:13:34.86 So that's why they joined and now to why they're fighting.
01:13:34.86 --> 01:13:36.22 And this is something to hear about.
01:13:36.22 --> 01:13:38.86 It's kind of a cliche thing.
01:13:38.86 --> 01:13:41.02 He's fighting for the guy who's left into his right.
01:13:41.02 --> 01:13:43.06 This is this way we're going to go into a little bit.
01:13:43.06 --> 01:13:45.30 Here's what it is and it's true.
01:13:45.30 --> 01:13:48.94 13 in a unit with good morale he fights out of loyalty to his comrades and his unit.
01:13:48.94 --> 01:13:51.18 Boom, there it is.
01:13:51.18 --> 01:13:53.22 This is important though.
01:13:53.22 --> 01:14:00.62 14 or he may fight because he is led to men at the front face danger and are often uncertain
01:14:00.62 --> 01:14:02.06 what to do about it.
01:14:02.06 --> 01:14:05.38 This is especially true in a unit with uncertain morale.
01:14:05.38 --> 01:14:09.50 It's like I said earlier, like sometimes the leaders, if you got a good leader that's
01:14:09.50 --> 01:14:13.02 going to make things happen, it's going to make things happen.
01:14:13.02 --> 01:14:15.02 This is a good one.
01:14:15.02 --> 01:14:16.02 15.
01:14:16.02 --> 01:14:20.70 Finally a man may fight because there's literally nothing else to do.
01:14:20.70 --> 01:14:23.62 And of course everyone uses the word literally now.
01:14:23.62 --> 01:14:25.62 All the time.
01:14:25.62 --> 01:14:32.50 And if you take it, if you remove that from your brain to make literally mean what
01:14:32.50 --> 01:14:34.70 it's supposed to mean.
01:14:34.70 --> 01:14:35.70 Think about the sentence.
01:14:35.70 --> 01:14:40.50 Finally a man may fight because there is literally nothing else to do.
01:14:40.50 --> 01:14:45.58 He and his comrades are in the war and at the front in battle.
01:14:45.58 --> 01:14:49.94 No one stops to figure out why he should escape from a burning house.
01:14:49.94 --> 01:14:51.42 So with fighting.
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:54.18 So yeah, there's some people like, oh yeah, guess what?
01:14:54.18 --> 01:14:56.58 You have two choices.
01:14:56.58 --> 01:14:58.22 Fight or die.
01:14:58.22 --> 01:15:01.78 And you're going to fight.
01:15:01.78 --> 01:15:05.02 How man meet defeat?
01:15:05.02 --> 01:15:10.06 The way a man stands up to a blow partly of course depends on how heavy the blow.
01:15:10.06 --> 01:15:14.50 And a man is faced with a very difficult problem or a series of them with any sort of obstacle
01:15:14.50 --> 01:15:17.02 or frustration when things become too difficult.
01:15:17.02 --> 01:15:18.58 There are three sorts of things he can do.
01:15:18.58 --> 01:15:23.34 He can work at it harder attacking the problem from new angles with increasing vigor.
01:15:23.34 --> 01:15:27.86 He can get mad and attempt to destroy the obstacle or himself or something else.
01:15:27.86 --> 01:15:33.42 And three, he can give up and despair and run away in apathy.
01:15:33.42 --> 01:15:35.82 The first way is the way of learning.
01:15:35.82 --> 01:15:36.82 Right?
01:15:36.82 --> 01:15:38.94 When what seems like a good plan is hit upon and it is tried.
01:15:38.94 --> 01:15:44.22 If this fails, there's a signal for more thinking when a good working plan is finally
01:15:44.22 --> 01:15:45.62 evolved.
01:15:45.62 --> 01:15:47.86 Success is achieved and the man is learned.
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:49.46 So that's the best thing to do.
01:15:49.46 --> 01:15:53.34 You try different solutions.
01:15:53.34 --> 01:15:55.54 All this activity is healthy and less the individual.
01:15:55.54 --> 01:15:56.82 Oh, there's a little balance.
01:15:56.82 --> 01:15:58.26 There's a little dichotomy here.
01:15:58.26 --> 01:16:00.62 All this activity is healthy.
01:16:00.62 --> 01:16:05.90 Unless the individual becomes so engrossed with a single problem, so obsessed by it that
01:16:05.90 --> 01:16:10.66 he fails to eat or sleep or pay attention to other necessary problems.
01:16:10.66 --> 01:16:14.90 Get a target fixation.
01:16:14.90 --> 01:16:20.42 Getting mad over disappointments or failures is generally not profitable.
01:16:20.42 --> 01:16:26.26 It's particularly hard on the innocent bystander because of the way men have of shifting
01:16:26.26 --> 01:16:31.02 their grouch from the original obstacle to other persons or things.
01:16:31.02 --> 01:16:36.22 The man who fails to get a promotion, he has been working and longing for doesn't take
01:16:36.22 --> 01:16:39.58 a poke at the officer who refused to recommend him.
01:16:39.58 --> 01:16:43.70 Much as he would like to have it out with him and said he's likely to kick his buddy in
01:16:43.70 --> 01:16:45.42 the pants so much as he raises.
01:16:45.42 --> 01:16:52.46 If he's so much as raised as an eyebrow, leaders too may take it out on a funding man who
01:16:52.46 --> 01:16:57.70 then wonder what's eaten him.
01:16:57.70 --> 01:17:02.58 Aggression may also be turned inward onto the self.
01:17:02.58 --> 01:17:07.94 Many a man goes about kicking himself, usually figuratively, but sometimes in real self
01:17:07.94 --> 01:17:12.02 punishments such as banging the head or punching or kicking a hard object until the flesh
01:17:12.02 --> 01:17:14.34 is bruised.
01:17:14.34 --> 01:17:20.26 Of course the extreme of self punishment for disastrous failure or frustration is suicide,
01:17:20.26 --> 01:17:25.46 but mostly suicide is just giving up.
01:17:25.46 --> 01:17:28.14 That first you don't succeed try try again.
01:17:28.14 --> 01:17:34.74 This adage may be used to maintain courage, but the process is actually governed by natural
01:17:34.74 --> 01:17:36.58 law.
01:17:36.58 --> 01:17:42.06 The number of times a man will attempt to accomplish a certain job or to reach a certain objective
01:17:42.06 --> 01:17:46.82 is governed in one direction by the importance of that particular success and in the other
01:17:46.82 --> 01:17:51.14 direction by the effort and pain involved in trying.
01:17:51.14 --> 01:17:57.86 And the successful achievement means less than the individual than the freedom from the strain
01:17:57.86 --> 01:18:02.26 of trying to attain it, any man will abandon the struggle.
01:18:02.26 --> 01:18:08.86 Giving up is nature's way of protecting the organism against too much pain.
01:18:08.86 --> 01:18:11.70 So that's my...
01:18:11.70 --> 01:18:13.86 Don't...
01:18:13.86 --> 01:18:18.30 Once you've banged your head against the wall 44 times, that's enough.
01:18:18.30 --> 01:18:22.34 That you're not going to get through it on the 45th or the 46th or the 47th try.
01:18:22.34 --> 01:18:26.66 You need to find a different way.
01:18:26.66 --> 01:18:28.70 That goes on.
01:18:28.70 --> 01:18:36.22 Giving up may mean defeat, but it does not always mean surrender.
01:18:36.22 --> 01:18:41.82 In most situation what is given up is some particular way of reaching the goal rather than
01:18:41.82 --> 01:18:45.70 a complete abandonment of the objective.
01:18:45.70 --> 01:18:50.50 It's sort of defeat results in thinking and fresh striving in eventual progress.
01:18:50.50 --> 01:18:54.30 A man who has been unable to get a commission in the army may enlist earn his stripes
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:58.62 and later reach an officer candidate school.
01:18:58.62 --> 01:19:01.34 Another kind of giving up results in compromise.
01:19:01.34 --> 01:19:07.06 The original objective is abandon, but another more easily achieved is substituted.
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:08.30 And this stuff is...
01:19:08.30 --> 01:19:14.14 This is the things that people get the impression that...
01:19:14.14 --> 01:19:15.14 Well, from me.
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:17.18 Well, you just never give up.
01:19:17.18 --> 01:19:19.18 Like, never compromise.
01:19:19.18 --> 01:19:21.18 It sounds really cool to say that.
01:19:21.18 --> 01:19:22.18 Yeah.
01:19:22.18 --> 01:19:23.18 There was no...
01:19:23.18 --> 01:19:25.18 There was no t-shirt back in the day.
01:19:25.18 --> 01:19:26.18 Sure.
01:19:26.18 --> 01:19:29.22 It was for H&K rifles.
01:19:29.22 --> 01:19:30.22 Yeah.
01:19:30.22 --> 01:19:34.82 And it said in a world of compromise, some don't.
01:19:34.82 --> 01:19:39.02 And had a picture of an entry team going into a building.
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:43.86 And of course, you hear that and you think that's right.
01:19:43.86 --> 01:19:46.46 So, you don't compromise ever.
01:19:46.46 --> 01:19:48.70 But here's the problem.
01:19:48.70 --> 01:19:55.54 No compromise means if you don't win every single time, you will get defeated and destroyed.
01:19:55.54 --> 01:19:56.54 Because you're not going to win.
01:19:56.54 --> 01:19:58.54 And the problem is that is you're not going to win every time.
01:19:58.54 --> 01:20:00.14 You're not going to win every argument that you have.
01:20:00.14 --> 01:20:03.22 You're not going to win every idea that you put forth isn't going to be the idea that
01:20:03.22 --> 01:20:05.06 could select it.
01:20:05.06 --> 01:20:09.22 And what you end up being is a person that can't work with anyone else.
01:20:09.22 --> 01:20:15.30 Or you end up a person that has one chance at charging a machine gun nest and you go straight
01:20:15.30 --> 01:20:18.38 forward up the hill towards the machine gun nest and guess what, everyone dies.
01:20:18.38 --> 01:20:19.38 Yeah.
01:20:19.38 --> 01:20:23.82 You didn't achieve the mission and everyone is dead.
01:20:23.82 --> 01:20:26.22 Now if you would have said, you know what, we tried.
01:20:26.22 --> 01:20:27.22 We lost two guys.
01:20:27.22 --> 01:20:31.86 We backed up, now we're in covered position and we're waiting for some reinforcements.
01:20:31.86 --> 01:20:34.22 And when the reinforcements show up, here's the plan.
01:20:34.22 --> 01:20:35.50 We're going to put down covering fire.
01:20:35.50 --> 01:20:38.18 We're going to maneuver around the flank or we're going to get a heavy weapon in here
01:20:38.18 --> 01:20:40.18 and we're going to shoot a bazooka at this thing.
01:20:40.18 --> 01:20:41.18 Whatever.
01:20:41.18 --> 01:20:46.22 So this one is in the book where it says, give up.
01:20:46.22 --> 01:20:47.86 It's not giving up.
01:20:47.86 --> 01:20:49.86 It's more like giving up on a certain thing.
01:20:49.86 --> 01:20:53.86 He says giving up does not always mean surrender.
01:20:53.86 --> 01:20:56.06 So surrender is like I give up on the mission.
01:20:56.06 --> 01:20:57.06 Yes.
01:20:57.06 --> 01:20:58.06 Essentially.
01:20:58.06 --> 01:20:59.06 Giving up is like giving up.
01:20:59.06 --> 01:21:04.06 Like just basically stop doing something that's not working kind of thing.
01:21:04.06 --> 01:21:05.06 Right.
01:21:05.06 --> 01:21:06.06 Yeah.
01:21:06.06 --> 01:21:08.82 So the question on the podcast is when is it okay to quit?
01:21:08.82 --> 01:21:09.82 Yes.
01:21:09.82 --> 01:21:10.82 Define this exact thing.
01:21:10.82 --> 01:21:11.82 Yeah.
01:21:11.82 --> 01:21:12.82 The definition.
01:21:12.82 --> 01:21:13.82 That's kind of the thing.
01:21:13.82 --> 01:21:18.82 And I had the conversation with a guy that we both know who was making a great effort
01:21:18.82 --> 01:21:19.94 in a business.
01:21:19.94 --> 01:21:25.02 The business was not being successful the way he had envisioned it.
01:21:25.02 --> 01:21:26.82 And it was costing him a lot of money.
01:21:26.82 --> 01:21:27.82 It was costing him time.
01:21:27.82 --> 01:21:30.38 He was putting all the efforts into it.
01:21:30.38 --> 01:21:41.38 And he literally asked me, hey man, if I shift to something else, is that quitting?
01:21:41.38 --> 01:21:46.78 And I said, it's quitting, but it's not surrendering.
01:21:46.78 --> 01:21:50.14 And I actually said, what is your goal?
01:21:50.14 --> 01:21:53.10 And his goal was not to be successful in that particular business.
01:21:53.10 --> 01:21:58.82 His goal was to spend time with his family and set up a safe financial situation for them.
01:21:58.82 --> 01:22:05.82 And he kind of got his wires crossed on thinking that this business that he had started
01:22:05.82 --> 01:22:07.14 was the mission.
01:22:07.14 --> 01:22:09.14 It wasn't the mission.
01:22:09.14 --> 01:22:12.82 The mission was taking care of his family and spending time with his family.
01:22:12.82 --> 01:22:15.86 And he was actually failing to do either.
01:22:15.86 --> 01:22:21.14 So sometimes you have to, sometimes you have to make those adjustments.
01:22:21.14 --> 01:22:22.14 You have to quit.
01:22:22.14 --> 01:22:25.82 You just because you quit one plan doesn't mean you surrender.
01:22:25.82 --> 01:22:26.82 Yeah.
01:22:26.82 --> 01:22:30.98 In fact, I would get mad at young seals when they would come up with a plan.
01:22:30.98 --> 01:22:34.62 They'd use the plan to go hit a training target.
01:22:34.62 --> 01:22:37.18 The plan would start to fail and they wouldn't adapt.
01:22:37.18 --> 01:22:38.18 They wouldn't change.
01:22:38.18 --> 01:22:39.18 They'd stick with the plan.
01:22:39.18 --> 01:22:40.18 I'm not a quitter.
01:22:40.18 --> 01:22:42.18 We're going to keep going.
01:22:42.18 --> 01:22:43.18 Well, really, okay.
01:22:43.18 --> 01:22:44.18 Cool.
01:22:44.18 --> 01:22:45.18 We'll kill everyone that you have.
01:22:45.18 --> 01:22:46.42 You can do buddy carries the rest of the night out here in the desert.
01:22:46.42 --> 01:22:47.58 I got all my.
01:22:47.58 --> 01:22:54.02 So it's essentially, when it comes down to it's almost like an issue with the language.
01:22:54.02 --> 01:22:59.26 Because like quitting, giving up like these are things that were kind of trained to think
01:22:59.26 --> 01:23:00.26 are bad.
01:23:00.26 --> 01:23:02.06 These are bad things to quit and give up.
01:23:02.06 --> 01:23:06.70 So all you have, I mean, and given what he's talking, you know, like nowadays, I've heard
01:23:06.70 --> 01:23:08.42 people use word pivot.
01:23:08.42 --> 01:23:10.10 Like the guy we're talking about with business, right?
01:23:10.10 --> 01:23:11.10 I've got pivot.
01:23:11.10 --> 01:23:12.10 Yeah, I got pivot.
01:23:12.10 --> 01:23:14.10 It's like, well, pivot, pivot, give up.
01:23:14.10 --> 01:23:19.58 I mean, I'd rather use word pivot because it sounds like, hey, I'm still on the mission
01:23:19.58 --> 01:23:20.58 on the path.
01:23:20.58 --> 01:23:21.58 I'm just taking a different direction.
01:23:21.58 --> 01:23:27.46 You know, it would we'd have to come up with a legitimate what never quit, which is what
01:23:27.46 --> 01:23:30.58 we're actually taught in the sealed teams.
01:23:30.58 --> 01:23:33.18 But then when you say you're never quit, that means never surrender.
01:23:33.18 --> 01:23:34.18 That's what that.
01:23:34.18 --> 01:23:40.26 That's what it really means is never lose sight of accomplishing and doing what it takes
01:23:40.26 --> 01:23:43.22 to accomplish your long term strategic goals.
01:23:43.22 --> 01:23:44.22 That's what it really means.
01:23:44.22 --> 01:23:46.10 But that doesn't sound as cool as never quit.
01:23:46.10 --> 01:23:47.10 Yeah.
01:23:47.10 --> 01:23:49.10 But then, and then give up same thing.
01:23:49.10 --> 01:23:54.34 Give up means like, this is too much for me or I'm not willing to work it hard through
01:23:54.34 --> 01:23:55.34 it or whatever.
01:23:55.34 --> 01:23:56.34 That's what it feels like.
01:23:56.34 --> 01:23:57.74 It means, but in this book, it doesn't mean that.
01:23:57.74 --> 01:24:02.02 I mean, here's a little, little dichotomy for me that kind of hurts it.
01:24:02.02 --> 01:24:03.98 I know I think it's pretty much ego talking.
01:24:03.98 --> 01:24:07.94 But I, when I hear pivot, I risk their golf.
01:24:07.94 --> 01:24:08.94 They're going so well.
01:24:08.94 --> 01:24:10.34 I think they're giving up on that.
01:24:10.34 --> 01:24:11.34 They're going to do it.
01:24:11.34 --> 01:24:12.34 And you know what that's like?
01:24:12.34 --> 01:24:14.18 That's having negative connotation, which is, which is not good.
01:24:14.18 --> 01:24:18.70 I'm criticizing myself for even having those shots because you do have to pivot in
01:24:18.70 --> 01:24:19.70 business.
01:24:19.70 --> 01:24:20.98 You do have to pivot in combat.
01:24:20.98 --> 01:24:24.38 You can't be like, oh, here's what we were trying to do and it wasn't working.
01:24:24.38 --> 01:24:25.94 So we're just going to do it harder.
01:24:25.94 --> 01:24:29.38 No, you actually have to say, hey, this isn't working and we're going to make some adjustments.
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:30.38 We're going to pivot.
01:24:30.38 --> 01:24:31.38 Yeah.
01:24:31.38 --> 01:24:35.82 And I think that's what that word was sort of introduced to that whole space to mean.
01:24:35.82 --> 01:24:37.30 Because of all these different.
01:24:37.30 --> 01:24:41.46 But then here's the thing, though, on the flip side, that some guys don't give up.
01:24:41.46 --> 01:24:44.70 They'll straight up give up because it's too much work and be like, I'm going to take a new
01:24:44.70 --> 01:24:45.70 direction in a life.
01:24:45.70 --> 01:24:52.70 You know, I'm going to pivot towards more of the personal stuff, more personal things.
01:24:52.70 --> 01:24:54.70 Yeah, I'm going to move this one.
01:24:54.70 --> 01:24:56.46 Meanwhile, they surrendered their whole mission.
01:24:56.46 --> 01:24:57.46 Those too much work.
01:24:57.46 --> 01:24:58.46 Right.
01:24:58.46 --> 01:25:00.82 You know, we're like, it didn't come as easier quickly or what it is.
01:25:00.82 --> 01:25:04.66 We're going to pivot or pivot hard if we need to.
01:25:04.66 --> 01:25:05.66 Yes.
01:25:05.66 --> 01:25:06.66 Check.
01:25:06.66 --> 01:25:13.86 Next, ability to accept defeat in such ways is no fault of character.
01:25:13.86 --> 01:25:19.06 In fact, a man who can take it and still do his best without bitterness is highly regarded
01:25:19.06 --> 01:25:22.70 in the army and in civilian life.
01:25:22.70 --> 01:25:27.70 But there are other ways of meeting defeat or disappointment that are destructive and
01:25:27.70 --> 01:25:31.22 may result in psychological casualty.
01:25:31.22 --> 01:25:36.78 The familiar sour grapes reaction is what happens in a man who has set his heart so firmly
01:25:36.78 --> 01:25:40.90 on a particular achievement that he can't give it up and face the fact.
01:25:40.90 --> 01:25:46.10 So he belittles or runs down the very job he wants so much to have.
01:25:46.10 --> 01:25:52.34 He says pilots are all crazy or fools and the whole flying game is a jip.
01:25:52.34 --> 01:25:53.34 You.
01:25:53.34 --> 01:25:56.62 We have to talk to good deal Dave Burke about that one.
01:25:56.62 --> 01:25:59.22 No, because that definitely happens.
01:25:59.22 --> 01:26:01.30 You know, you get someone that's trying to achieve.
01:26:01.30 --> 01:26:02.82 You're going to care about a black belt.
01:26:02.82 --> 01:26:03.82 Yeah.
01:26:03.82 --> 01:26:04.82 It's not even that big with deal.
01:26:04.82 --> 01:26:05.82 Yeah.
01:26:05.82 --> 01:26:06.82 Cool.
01:26:06.82 --> 01:26:07.82 Don't get one.
01:26:07.82 --> 01:26:08.82 Because apparently you're not sour grapes.
01:26:08.82 --> 01:26:11.34 You know where that expression comes from?
01:26:11.34 --> 01:26:12.34 I do not.
01:26:12.34 --> 01:26:13.34 Yeah.
01:26:13.34 --> 01:26:14.34 So I didn't either.
01:26:14.34 --> 01:26:15.86 No, until I was willing to adulthood.
01:26:15.86 --> 01:26:17.98 So it's like a old, what do you call them?
01:26:17.98 --> 01:26:18.98 Little fable.
01:26:18.98 --> 01:26:19.98 I don't know.
01:26:19.98 --> 01:26:20.98 I don't know.
01:26:20.98 --> 01:26:22.78 What is it when it's like a story that didn't really happen.
01:26:22.78 --> 01:26:24.98 But it was a so all the favor.
01:26:24.98 --> 01:26:25.98 Super short.
01:26:25.98 --> 01:26:27.66 So this fox.
01:26:27.66 --> 01:26:33.22 It was hungry and saw some grapes up on the vines, right?
01:26:33.22 --> 01:26:34.70 And so the fox is like dang, that's pretty high.
01:26:34.70 --> 01:26:35.70 So it's all good.
01:26:35.70 --> 01:26:36.70 I'm going to jump up on me.
01:26:36.70 --> 01:26:37.70 Eat those grapes.
01:26:37.70 --> 01:26:39.70 Okay.
01:26:39.70 --> 01:26:40.70 Jump up.
01:26:40.70 --> 01:26:41.70 Mises the grape.
01:26:41.70 --> 01:26:42.70 He can't jump high enough.
01:26:42.70 --> 01:26:43.70 So he's like, all right.
01:26:43.70 --> 01:26:46.70 He comes back and he's like, you know, I just got to jump higher.
01:26:46.70 --> 01:26:47.70 That's all.
01:26:47.70 --> 01:26:48.70 So he jumps hot.
01:26:48.70 --> 01:26:49.70 Even higher still can't.
01:26:49.70 --> 01:26:50.70 Still can't.
01:26:50.70 --> 01:26:51.70 Try as again.
01:26:51.70 --> 01:26:52.70 Still can't get him.
01:26:52.70 --> 01:26:53.70 Again, still can't get him.
01:26:53.70 --> 01:26:55.70 Finally gives up.
01:26:55.70 --> 01:26:56.70 Doesn't pivot.
01:26:56.70 --> 01:26:57.70 Gives up.
01:26:57.70 --> 01:26:59.70 And while he's leaving, he says.
01:26:59.70 --> 01:27:02.70 Scrapes were probably sour anyway.
01:27:02.70 --> 01:27:03.70 There it is.
01:27:03.70 --> 01:27:05.70 There you go.
01:27:05.70 --> 01:27:09.70 Don't like that.
01:27:09.70 --> 01:27:10.70 Continuing.
01:27:10.70 --> 01:27:17.50 More likely to occur is a sort of symbolic running away through fainting illness or physical
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:18.50 defect.
01:27:18.50 --> 01:27:24.30 Defect a man faced with failure to pass an examination for a promotion or he is long
01:27:24.30 --> 01:27:28.50 for may suddenly a nouncyty is colorblind or nightblind or has some other previously
01:27:28.50 --> 01:27:31.90 undiscovered defect that would prevent a success.
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:36.10 And then the story may become actually ill and be honestly unaware of the connection between
01:27:36.10 --> 01:27:38.50 sudden sickness and frustration.
01:27:38.50 --> 01:27:46.70 This is a fainting physical defect is a big one for people that don't make it through
01:27:46.70 --> 01:27:49.10 some kind of military training program.
01:27:49.10 --> 01:27:50.10 So what is that?
01:27:50.10 --> 01:27:51.90 That's like we're like, what happened?
01:27:51.90 --> 01:27:53.90 I remember my like, right.
01:27:53.90 --> 01:27:59.30 Maybe they did it or we are so are they blaming something that actually is occurring
01:27:59.30 --> 01:28:01.50 or are they just sort of making it physical effect?
01:28:01.50 --> 01:28:03.50 I couldn't do this because my life was hurt.
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:06.70 That's why I didn't make it through the program because I got this.
01:28:06.70 --> 01:28:07.70 I got that.
01:28:07.70 --> 01:28:08.70 Okay.
01:28:08.70 --> 01:28:14.70 And the other thing they make is sometimes people actually get sick but it's because they're
01:28:14.70 --> 01:28:17.50 you know, the mind body connection.
01:28:17.50 --> 01:28:21.70 It's crazy.
01:28:21.70 --> 01:28:22.70 Back to the book.
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:26.10 Each man no matter how strong mentally and physically has his limits beyond which the
01:28:26.10 --> 01:28:29.70 strongest will cannot drive him.
01:28:29.70 --> 01:28:34.98 The wise man learns his own tolerances and cautiously retreats if possible to a more
01:28:34.98 --> 01:28:44.02 defended position when hazards and obstacles he is in danger of are too great.
01:28:44.02 --> 01:28:48.10 It's amazing that they so clearly understood this.
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:50.78 This is 1942 or something like that.
01:28:50.78 --> 01:28:53.74 And they're saying look, they're saying the exact same thing that's a big revelation
01:28:53.74 --> 01:28:54.74 to say, pivot.
01:28:54.74 --> 01:28:56.74 They're saying the same thing.
01:28:56.74 --> 01:29:02.74 Rage, a two-edged weapon.
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:06.82 A group of tanks stands in a field silent motionless and dead.
01:29:06.82 --> 01:29:09.66 Suddenly switches on from a motor start and they become alive.
01:29:09.66 --> 01:29:12.94 Noise bursts from their exhaust and they roar to attack.
01:29:12.94 --> 01:29:17.42 A gun is a nerd and dead until a high explosive powder is set off in its chambers.
01:29:17.42 --> 01:29:20.62 A bomb without nitroglycerin is a dud.
01:29:20.62 --> 01:29:25.06 All weapons are mere useless pieces of metal until the release of energy brings them
01:29:25.06 --> 01:29:26.06 to life.
01:29:26.06 --> 01:29:35.66 Man, two, as a weapon of war must have energy released to galvanize him into acting, fighting
01:29:35.66 --> 01:29:38.18 soldier.
01:29:38.18 --> 01:29:45.18 And the high explosive that sets off a man's fighting power is emotion.
01:29:45.18 --> 01:29:49.70 There are certain things that a man can do in an automatic way without the fire of emotional
01:29:49.70 --> 01:29:50.70 energy.
01:29:50.70 --> 01:29:55.54 These things would win no wars without fear and without rage.
01:29:55.54 --> 01:30:00.14 You could not even defend himself of the enemy or aiming at him and about to fire.
01:30:00.14 --> 01:30:05.38 Slap a man's face and he will become in rage, drop a bomb beside him and he may become
01:30:05.38 --> 01:30:07.62 terrified.
01:30:07.62 --> 01:30:15.26 But although the two feelings may seem different to the man very different, inwardly,
01:30:15.26 --> 01:30:18.42 the change that take place in his body or similar.
01:30:18.42 --> 01:30:23.06 His heart beats faster, his blood pressure rises, his blood is shifted from internal organs
01:30:23.06 --> 01:30:28.74 to the muscles, his digestion stop, stops, sugar in his blood increases, his hands tremble,
01:30:28.74 --> 01:30:34.14 his voice quivers, the body wists in the bladder or bowels may be expelled, he becomes
01:30:34.14 --> 01:30:36.98 alert and ready for instant action.
01:30:36.98 --> 01:30:41.62 Whether all this extreme preparation for action by the body is a good thing for the soldier
01:30:41.62 --> 01:30:46.42 or whether it will eventually or whether it will actually endanger his life depends on
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:48.14 the circumstances.
01:30:48.14 --> 01:30:54.66 And in primitive hand to hand combat when the last ounce of energy of which the body is capable
01:30:54.66 --> 01:31:01.42 must be summoned instantly for one tremendous spur of running to get away from peril or
01:31:01.42 --> 01:31:07.62 for one outburst of physical strength to down the foe, rage or fear will pour into blood
01:31:07.62 --> 01:31:13.34 the adrenaline necessary to rouse that vital energy.
01:31:13.34 --> 01:31:19.34 If the immediate vigorous action is impossible, however, and if life depends instead upon
01:31:19.34 --> 01:31:26.38 the cool headed use of skill, self-control and discipline, then violent emotion can put
01:31:26.38 --> 01:31:31.34 the soldier in mortal peril.
01:31:31.34 --> 01:31:37.34 So this one thing can kill you or save you.
01:31:37.34 --> 01:31:41.82 Yeah, it's an interesting differentiation there where it's like, hey, if the task kind of
01:31:41.82 --> 01:31:45.34 requires skill and stuff, you've got to control that.
01:31:45.34 --> 01:31:49.54 You can't be doing it, but if it's like, hey, if you sometimes, because it's face it
01:31:49.54 --> 01:31:54.50 in life and whatever, sometimes it just, you just got to power through some stuff.
01:31:54.50 --> 01:31:55.50 Everyone's doing well.
01:31:55.50 --> 01:31:56.50 Yeah, no doubt about it.
01:31:56.50 --> 01:32:02.10 And actually, you said, how put quite eloquently?
01:32:02.10 --> 01:32:06.26 Sometimes you have to use your logic and sometimes you have to use your logic and sometimes
01:32:06.26 --> 01:32:10.10 you have to use your logic and then you have to use your logic and then you have to use
01:32:10.10 --> 01:32:11.94 it in the field manual.
01:32:11.94 --> 01:32:15.82 Sometimes, if your logic fails, like, if you can't think of a good reason why I
01:32:15.82 --> 01:32:19.48 should I do another set or why should I go competing this thing?
01:32:19.48 --> 01:32:22.46 You have to let your emotions get a little get in the game.
01:32:22.46 --> 01:32:26.10 And then sometimes your emotions get shut down.
01:32:26.10 --> 01:32:27.10 Yeah.
01:32:27.10 --> 01:32:28.02 Because the goods are just stupid.
01:32:28.02 --> 01:32:29.02 Doesn't make sense.
01:32:29.02 --> 01:32:30.02 Yeah.
01:32:30.02 --> 01:32:31.02 Yeah.
01:32:31.02 --> 01:32:32.54 Well, then you got to let your emotions go.
01:32:32.54 --> 01:32:33.54 Wait, me, it doesn't make sense.
01:32:33.54 --> 01:32:35.14 Because you're being weak.
01:32:35.14 --> 01:32:37.02 You don't like that.
01:32:37.02 --> 01:32:38.02 It's bad.
01:32:38.02 --> 01:32:43.02 Logic one, a lot of times is, well, it's more dynamic, I'd say,
01:32:43.90 --> 01:32:46.14 because you can have full cut-wall on it,
01:32:46.14 --> 01:32:49.06 but I can have full conversations in my head.
01:32:49.06 --> 01:32:50.50 And the work you're not one was a big one,
01:32:50.50 --> 01:32:53.10 where I'm like, think about how you'll feel after.
01:32:53.10 --> 01:32:55.06 That's gonna be the benefit, you know?
01:32:55.06 --> 01:32:56.26 But then at the same time, I would be like,
01:32:56.26 --> 01:32:58.06 hey, wait, but you could easily rest right now.
01:32:58.06 --> 01:32:59.78 You can get recut, you know, so it's like,
01:32:59.78 --> 01:33:03.34 you're one of those guys, it has a huge, huge,
01:33:03.34 --> 01:33:06.46 surplus of standing by things that are like, look,
01:33:06.46 --> 01:33:09.06 you know, the most important part of working out is,
01:33:09.06 --> 01:33:13.46 as a representative, you don't grow.
01:33:13.46 --> 01:33:15.34 You don't get stronger when you're working out.
01:33:15.34 --> 01:33:17.38 You actually get stronger when you rest.
01:33:17.38 --> 01:33:18.18 Yep, when you rest.
01:33:18.18 --> 01:33:19.02 Sure.
01:33:19.02 --> 01:33:20.26 You got that little voice, so you get that,
01:33:20.26 --> 01:33:22.66 that one little monkey on your shoulder,
01:33:22.66 --> 01:33:24.14 that's whispered in those things.
01:33:24.14 --> 01:33:26.62 Yeah, but now I got you who, in like,
01:33:26.62 --> 01:33:27.46 the big monkey.
01:33:27.46 --> 01:33:30.06 Yeah, even bigger one, because,
01:33:30.06 --> 01:33:32.18 and I got this from you, essentially, where it's like,
01:33:32.18 --> 01:33:35.86 okay, I can, this is kind of the conversations
01:33:35.86 --> 01:33:39.34 went on my head, typically.
01:33:39.34 --> 01:33:41.22 So yes, I can be like, yeah, the recovery,
01:33:41.22 --> 01:33:44.62 that's how you, you know, get the gains, whatever,
01:33:44.62 --> 01:33:46.46 that's on one side, then the other side is like,
01:33:46.46 --> 01:33:49.42 wait, but you want to train a whole,
01:33:49.42 --> 01:33:51.22 there's way more to working out
01:33:51.22 --> 01:33:53.58 than just getting bigger and stronger.
01:33:53.58 --> 01:33:54.66 There's more to it.
01:33:54.66 --> 01:33:56.66 There's mental exercise, there's mental toughness
01:33:56.66 --> 01:33:58.30 exercises in there, there's doing, you know,
01:33:58.30 --> 01:34:00.02 discipline all these things.
01:34:00.02 --> 01:34:02.42 Oh yeah, and hand their more, like,
01:34:02.42 --> 01:34:05.86 they're longer lasting, like things to develop,
01:34:05.86 --> 01:34:07.18 you know, like when you develop them,
01:34:07.18 --> 01:34:08.50 they apply them more things.
01:34:08.50 --> 01:34:13.94 So I can be easily be like, hey, I don't feel like it today.
01:34:13.94 --> 01:34:16.54 That's my body telling me I should rest today.
01:34:16.54 --> 01:34:19.18 Yeah, I really don't feel like it physically.
01:34:19.18 --> 01:34:21.86 And that is true, it's probably true,
01:34:21.86 --> 01:34:25.26 but what else is true is if I can train myself
01:34:25.26 --> 01:34:28.18 to power through these sorts of situations,
01:34:28.18 --> 01:34:29.46 even though they're true,
01:34:29.46 --> 01:34:31.58 that's gonna serve me way better in life,
01:34:31.58 --> 01:34:33.82 so if I do that, that's gonna allow this.
01:34:33.82 --> 01:34:35.70 Yeah, so I'm like, dang.
01:34:35.70 --> 01:34:37.42 So now I got to explain some of that stuff
01:34:37.42 --> 01:34:40.90 to my youngest daughter, my youngest daughter,
01:34:40.90 --> 01:34:45.90 about how competition is good.
01:34:46.70 --> 01:34:48.06 And the reason competition is good
01:34:48.06 --> 01:34:50.02 is because life is a competition.
01:34:50.02 --> 01:34:52.38 It is a straight-up competition.
01:34:52.38 --> 01:34:55.26 And if you're not good at competing,
01:34:55.26 --> 01:34:57.10 if you don't get comfortable with competing,
01:34:57.10 --> 01:34:59.22 that's gonna be a problem when it comes time
01:34:59.22 --> 01:35:01.02 to compete, which you will have to,
01:35:01.02 --> 01:35:03.14 you're not gonna get through life without competing
01:35:03.14 --> 01:35:05.06 for things, for whatever.
01:35:05.06 --> 01:35:06.46 It doesn't happen.
01:35:06.46 --> 01:35:08.14 You're gonna have to compete for a job.
01:35:08.14 --> 01:35:10.22 You're gonna have to compete for,
01:35:10.22 --> 01:35:15.06 to meet someone, to be your wife or husband.
01:35:15.06 --> 01:35:17.10 There's a competition going on for that.
01:35:17.10 --> 01:35:19.02 They're just not like down for the call,
01:35:19.02 --> 01:35:19.86 it's out of the gate.
01:35:19.86 --> 01:35:22.78 No, if you've got a fight off other humans,
01:35:22.78 --> 01:35:25.42 to get what you want.
01:35:25.42 --> 01:35:29.02 Whether it's a spouse, whether it's a job,
01:35:29.02 --> 01:35:33.66 whether it's a promotion, whether it's a part in the school play.
01:35:33.66 --> 01:35:35.54 There's other people that are gonna be trying,
01:35:35.54 --> 01:35:37.02 I was telling my little daughter this.
01:35:37.02 --> 01:35:40.18 You think they're just gonna step aside when you show up?
01:35:40.18 --> 01:35:42.02 You want the lead role?
01:35:42.02 --> 01:35:44.02 You know, you got it.
01:35:44.02 --> 01:35:45.58 No, it's a competition.
01:35:45.58 --> 01:35:47.78 And you want to destroy the competition.
01:35:47.78 --> 01:35:49.58 And the way you do that is you compete,
01:35:49.58 --> 01:35:51.02 you compete in different things a lot.
01:35:51.02 --> 01:35:53.58 You push yourself and you figure out
01:35:53.58 --> 01:35:55.14 what it takes to step up.
01:35:55.14 --> 01:35:55.98 Yeah.
01:35:55.98 --> 01:35:57.38 Like wrestling a lot.
01:35:57.38 --> 01:36:00.34 Wrestling puts a lot of pressure on kids.
01:36:00.34 --> 01:36:02.50 And it is straight competition,
01:36:02.50 --> 01:36:05.62 mono, emono, or in the case of my daughter.
01:36:05.62 --> 01:36:06.46 What is that?
01:36:07.62 --> 01:36:08.62 Female women.
01:36:08.62 --> 01:36:11.22 That's what mono versus the mono.
01:36:11.22 --> 01:36:13.18 It is straight competition.
01:36:13.18 --> 01:36:14.94 You against another human being.
01:36:14.94 --> 01:36:16.14 One, you's gonna win.
01:36:16.14 --> 01:36:19.38 One, you's gonna lose 100% of the time.
01:36:19.38 --> 01:36:20.74 That's what's gonna happen.
01:36:20.74 --> 01:36:22.38 And it's all on you.
01:36:22.38 --> 01:36:23.22 Yeah.
01:36:23.22 --> 01:36:25.94 So that's really good for people.
01:36:25.94 --> 01:36:27.10 It's good for kids.
01:36:27.10 --> 01:36:28.10 Yeah.
01:36:28.10 --> 01:36:29.86 Well, do you just need to competition, same thing.
01:36:29.86 --> 01:36:32.34 And then you just get, you can just say any kind of competition.
01:36:32.34 --> 01:36:33.34 Yeah.
01:36:33.34 --> 01:36:35.90 Yeah, it's like a, well, a dichotomy, too.
01:36:35.90 --> 01:36:38.58 You know, in the spirit of accuracy,
01:36:38.58 --> 01:36:40.82 it's kind of like life.
01:36:40.82 --> 01:36:44.30 Not to get too deep here, but life is half competition,
01:36:44.30 --> 01:36:45.98 half collaboration.
01:36:45.98 --> 01:36:47.66 So it could be different.
01:36:47.66 --> 01:36:49.26 It could be 60, 40 and whatever.
01:36:49.26 --> 01:36:50.10 Whatever.
01:36:50.10 --> 01:36:51.86 You're 100% competition for me in a bunch of
01:36:51.86 --> 01:36:52.86 collaborations for you.
01:36:52.86 --> 01:36:53.86 But, but.
01:36:53.86 --> 01:36:58.86 Yeah.
01:36:58.86 --> 01:37:02.02 But here's the thing where, yeah, you get people who lean too far towards competition.
01:37:02.02 --> 01:37:05.70 They start to alienate people and they can't, you know, maintain relationships like all these
01:37:05.70 --> 01:37:06.70 problems.
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:08.02 They're playing the short game.
01:37:08.02 --> 01:37:09.02 Sort game.
01:37:09.02 --> 01:37:10.02 Yes.
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:11.02 And the collaboration.
01:37:11.02 --> 01:37:12.50 If there's a long game, that's not a factor.
01:37:12.50 --> 01:37:13.50 Yeah.
01:37:13.50 --> 01:37:16.74 Because they're realizing, oh, I'm gonna win in the long game.
01:37:16.74 --> 01:37:20.06 So this short game is a sacrifice, you know, problem.
01:37:20.06 --> 01:37:21.06 Oh, yes.
01:37:21.06 --> 01:37:23.62 I want to, you know, I'm not gonna do something that's gonna create
01:37:23.62 --> 01:37:27.70 an antagonistic relationship with these people that I'm gonna count on in the future.
01:37:27.70 --> 01:37:28.70 So guess what?
01:37:28.70 --> 01:37:30.50 We're gonna take a little hit right now.
01:37:30.50 --> 01:37:33.94 We're gonna make something, you know, you make compromises because you're focused
01:37:33.94 --> 01:37:38.18 on the long game because ultimately, it is a competition.
01:37:38.18 --> 01:37:39.18 Yeah.
01:37:39.18 --> 01:37:40.18 Well, it is a competition.
01:37:40.18 --> 01:37:41.18 Sure.
01:37:41.18 --> 01:37:42.78 Um, not everything's a competition.
01:37:42.78 --> 01:37:44.78 It's a lot of it is a collaboration.
01:37:44.78 --> 01:37:48.26 But within, I mean, most times we collaborate to compete.
01:37:48.26 --> 01:37:49.26 Yeah.
01:37:49.26 --> 01:37:52.50 So it is, it's like a little balance, like a little dance you're doing with
01:37:52.50 --> 01:37:53.82 collaboration competition.
01:37:53.82 --> 01:37:56.58 That's why I think anyway, I don't know.
01:37:56.58 --> 01:38:03.42 But from what I can view or see observed that, yeah, if you lean too much towards competition,
01:38:03.42 --> 01:38:07.42 yes, you, you drive yourself up and if you can do much towards collaboration.
01:38:07.42 --> 01:38:08.42 It is a dichotomy.
01:38:08.42 --> 01:38:09.42 You drive yourself up too.
01:38:09.42 --> 01:38:11.22 It's like you can't, you can't succeed.
01:38:11.22 --> 01:38:14.54 It's like you can't get out of like, you little cow.
01:38:14.54 --> 01:38:15.86 Yeah, it should be balanced.
01:38:15.86 --> 01:38:19.90 And if you are competing on things, because there's people that compete on things,
01:38:19.90 --> 01:38:20.90 they don't matter.
01:38:20.90 --> 01:38:21.90 Yeah.
01:38:21.90 --> 01:38:24.50 And then while, or they compete when they should be collaborating.
01:38:24.50 --> 01:38:25.50 Yeah.
01:38:25.50 --> 01:38:26.50 That's true, too.
01:38:26.50 --> 01:38:29.10 Or they're afraid to compete.
01:38:29.10 --> 01:38:30.34 So they don't compete at all.
01:38:30.34 --> 01:38:31.34 Yeah.
01:38:31.34 --> 01:38:32.34 So there's all kinds of problems.
01:38:32.34 --> 01:38:39.78 But yes, I, what am I, I'm speaking a little bit simplified for my daughter, because
01:38:39.78 --> 01:38:44.66 what my daughter, when I want my kids to realize is that there is competition.
01:38:44.66 --> 01:38:45.66 Yeah.
01:38:45.66 --> 01:38:47.78 And that they're part of it, whether they want to be or not, that's the point that I'm
01:38:47.78 --> 01:38:48.78 trying to make.
01:38:48.78 --> 01:38:53.18 So when I talked to my daughter about something, and she gives me a kind of a shoulder
01:38:53.18 --> 01:38:55.02 shoulder, a shoulder about something.
01:38:55.02 --> 01:39:01.90 When it's not a shoulder, a shoulder situation, then you are understanding that things
01:39:01.90 --> 01:39:03.66 are a competition.
01:39:03.66 --> 01:39:06.06 And life is a competition.
01:39:06.06 --> 01:39:08.78 And you know what?
01:39:08.78 --> 01:39:15.42 It is hard to say, it's, it's, it's very extreme to say everything in life or life
01:39:15.42 --> 01:39:18.54 in general or life as a whole is a competition.
01:39:18.54 --> 01:39:19.86 That's a real extreme statement.
01:39:19.86 --> 01:39:22.10 And I can see I totally agree with your point.
01:39:22.10 --> 01:39:29.66 And you are correct that that can result in then a bad attitude.
01:39:29.66 --> 01:39:32.02 And really, not even just a bad attitude, a bad life.
01:39:32.02 --> 01:39:35.62 I mean, you can end up, like you said, you can alienate everyone and you can end up alone
01:39:35.62 --> 01:39:37.58 and you're competing and you're, I beat that person.
01:39:37.58 --> 01:39:38.58 I beat that person.
01:39:38.58 --> 01:39:41.82 And now you're just, you've lost, that's the thing.
01:39:41.82 --> 01:39:47.66 You've lost a whole section of your competition, which is developing relationships with
01:39:47.66 --> 01:39:51.38 other human beings that you can then count upon in your times of need or that you can
01:39:51.38 --> 01:39:52.38 provide for.
01:39:52.38 --> 01:39:54.94 It's like, all you've ruined everything.
01:39:54.94 --> 01:40:01.30 So, but what I'm saying is even that right there, if you think about it in terms of what
01:40:01.30 --> 01:40:05.02 I just said, you lost.
01:40:05.02 --> 01:40:10.74 So ultimately, to win the competition, you have to be aware of it.
01:40:10.74 --> 01:40:12.26 You have to compete.
01:40:12.26 --> 01:40:17.82 Competing, this is probably the crux of what we're trying to say, competing doesn't always
01:40:17.82 --> 01:40:20.82 mean.
01:40:20.82 --> 01:40:22.82 Competing smashing the other person.
01:40:22.82 --> 01:40:23.82 Yeah.
01:40:23.82 --> 01:40:25.54 Competing doesn't always mean that.
01:40:25.54 --> 01:40:29.18 Sometimes competing means actually letting the other person win.
01:40:29.18 --> 01:40:30.18 Yeah.
01:40:30.18 --> 01:40:37.34 Competing sometimes means letting get compromising because I'm going to win the long game.
01:40:37.34 --> 01:40:39.02 I'm playing a long game over here.
01:40:39.02 --> 01:40:40.02 Yeah.
01:40:40.02 --> 01:40:41.82 And you're playing around with the short game.
01:40:41.82 --> 01:40:42.82 It'd be a good job.
01:40:42.82 --> 01:40:43.82 I'm going to applaud you.
01:40:43.82 --> 01:40:44.82 Maybe golf clap.
01:40:44.82 --> 01:40:45.82 Yeah.
01:40:45.82 --> 01:40:47.82 Yeah, man.
01:40:47.82 --> 01:40:48.82 It's true.
01:40:48.82 --> 01:40:51.66 Because you can collaborate all you want.
01:40:51.66 --> 01:40:55.86 But if you have, like how you put it, the long game, which is really, really effective
01:40:55.86 --> 01:40:58.46 way to look at it, by the way, with everything.
01:40:58.46 --> 01:41:05.58 But if you can be collaborating and be the best team player in the whole wide world.
01:41:05.58 --> 01:41:09.14 But your goal, your goal, is for your team.
01:41:09.14 --> 01:41:10.14 You're the team player.
01:41:10.14 --> 01:41:12.02 It's for your team to win.
01:41:12.02 --> 01:41:13.02 Whatever you're doing.
01:41:13.02 --> 01:41:17.14 And win, I mean, here's the thing where worse, I think people get emotionally jammed
01:41:17.14 --> 01:41:19.14 up when they hear like, you're a competition.
01:41:19.14 --> 01:41:21.42 And that shouldn't be like that or whatever.
01:41:21.42 --> 01:41:22.90 To win in life.
01:41:22.90 --> 01:41:27.06 Win, mean, they think that, like, I win, you lose trying to start a bit.
01:41:27.06 --> 01:41:30.38 But really when it comes up, even just genetically.
01:41:30.38 --> 01:41:34.34 And Holly's say, finding a mate or reproducing whatever.
01:41:34.34 --> 01:41:37.06 It's like you're survival of the fittest, right?
01:41:37.06 --> 01:41:42.18 You know, when is some kind of thing, like, organisms compete for mate compete for this.
01:41:42.18 --> 01:41:44.54 So it's kind of like, that's how it is.
01:41:44.54 --> 01:41:47.42 You know, it's not like I'm a person, you're a person.
01:41:47.42 --> 01:41:50.30 I'm going to win and defeat you and you're the loser.
01:41:50.30 --> 01:41:51.30 It's not that thing.
01:41:51.30 --> 01:41:53.58 It's like basically you want to be successful.
01:41:53.58 --> 01:41:59.38 And for for most situations for you to be successful, you have to kind of, you have
01:41:59.38 --> 01:42:02.50 to beat someone out of them.
01:42:02.50 --> 01:42:03.50 Them being successful.
01:42:03.50 --> 01:42:06.22 And in order to be successful, you also have to play the game.
01:42:06.22 --> 01:42:12.78 You also have to play the game by the rules, because otherwise you end up ostracized or in jail,
01:42:12.78 --> 01:42:13.78 right?
01:42:13.78 --> 01:42:14.78 Because you could say, I'm going to win.
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:16.58 That's what I'm going to make the most money.
01:42:16.58 --> 01:42:17.86 So I'm going to be no mistylet from people.
01:42:17.86 --> 01:42:21.14 I'm going to do immoral things in order to get there.
01:42:21.14 --> 01:42:26.06 That would be everything's a competition attitude, but it's the wrong attitude.
01:42:26.06 --> 01:42:27.22 Because you're not going to win in the end.
01:42:27.22 --> 01:42:28.22 You're going to lose.
01:42:28.22 --> 01:42:29.98 You're going to be in jail.
01:42:29.98 --> 01:42:31.58 So you lost.
01:42:31.58 --> 01:42:36.42 But if you realize that it is a competition, and you have to play the rules, and you have
01:42:36.42 --> 01:42:40.06 to win the game, and winning the game means that you are successful in a place where you
01:42:40.06 --> 01:42:42.50 can help other people, and you've got what you need.
01:42:42.50 --> 01:42:44.30 And that's what we're looking for.
01:42:44.30 --> 01:42:45.30 Yeah.
01:42:45.30 --> 01:42:46.30 Yeah.
01:42:46.30 --> 01:42:49.50 Definitely dichotomy with that one.
01:42:49.50 --> 01:42:53.10 Speaking of dichotomy, going back to the book, it is possible.
01:42:53.10 --> 01:42:59.58 It is as possible to be literally blinded by rage as it is to be paralyzed by fear.
01:42:59.58 --> 01:43:04.74 The prize fighter knows that he can win against a stronger and more skilled opponent.
01:43:04.74 --> 01:43:09.62 If he can rouse his opponent to violent anger in which he strikes wildly and fails to use
01:43:09.62 --> 01:43:10.62 his science.
01:43:10.62 --> 01:43:11.62 We'll see that all the time.
01:43:11.62 --> 01:43:14.82 You've got to maintain your composure.
01:43:14.82 --> 01:43:20.06 You know, fight on the mats, even on the mats of justice for the jujitsu.
01:43:20.06 --> 01:43:21.06 Oh, yeah.
01:43:21.06 --> 01:43:22.06 Big time.
01:43:22.06 --> 01:43:28.22 You know what movie was like the epitome of that was a few good men.
01:43:28.22 --> 01:43:29.22 Remember at the end?
01:43:29.22 --> 01:43:32.42 Oh, when he was like, when he made him admit to it, yeah.
01:43:32.42 --> 01:43:33.42 Yeah.
01:43:33.42 --> 01:43:34.42 That's exactly what he did.
01:43:34.42 --> 01:43:35.42 Don't know.
01:43:35.42 --> 01:43:37.86 Took him out of the game, got him all riled up, made him.
01:43:37.86 --> 01:43:38.86 This bad man.
01:43:38.86 --> 01:43:39.86 That was good.
01:43:39.86 --> 01:43:40.86 You can't handle the truth.
01:43:40.86 --> 01:43:41.86 That's right.
01:43:41.86 --> 01:43:42.94 That was a good speech, though, by the way.
01:43:42.94 --> 01:43:47.98 He'd but he let the rage and the emotion cause a problem for him.
01:43:47.98 --> 01:43:50.34 He couldn't just, he didn't have to do anything.
01:43:50.34 --> 01:43:52.34 He could, he just kept his most of it.
01:43:52.34 --> 01:43:53.34 Be like him, whatever.
01:43:53.34 --> 01:43:54.34 No.
01:43:54.34 --> 01:43:55.34 Didn't do it.
01:43:55.34 --> 01:43:56.34 He taught him.
01:43:56.34 --> 01:44:01.62 Then Tom Cruise, he played the game really well.
01:44:01.62 --> 01:44:03.34 No, to attack his emotions.
01:44:03.34 --> 01:44:10.98 You know, is it funny that if you understand psychology and human nature, you can actually
01:44:10.98 --> 01:44:16.86 play it on someone and bring their own demise based on something that they're going to do for
01:44:16.86 --> 01:44:17.86 themselves.
01:44:17.86 --> 01:44:21.30 Yeah, that's why it's important to understand human nature.
01:44:21.30 --> 01:44:25.98 Back to the book, the main purpose behind all the long routine of military training
01:44:25.98 --> 01:44:30.10 and the pre-conditioning of troops to simulate battle conditions to drill into soldiers fighting
01:44:30.10 --> 01:44:31.10 habits.
01:44:31.10 --> 01:44:32.10 So deeply ingrained.
01:44:32.10 --> 01:44:37.70 So intimately second nature that they will persist in the face of the most overwhelming
01:44:37.70 --> 01:44:40.58 provocations to rage or panic.
01:44:40.58 --> 01:44:45.34 Long practice in shooting cool, yet a target without undo excitement without blood, lost,
01:44:45.34 --> 01:44:50.78 makes it possible for the soldier to shoot calmly as at his target when his very life
01:44:50.78 --> 01:44:53.78 and the safety of his pals are at stake.
01:44:53.78 --> 01:44:55.74 His hand must not tremble then.
01:44:55.74 --> 01:45:01.26 His keen eye and steady nerve must not waver.
01:45:01.26 --> 01:45:06.10 Fortunately men and civilized society have been trained since early childhood to control
01:45:06.10 --> 01:45:10.06 and discipline their natural impulses.
01:45:10.06 --> 01:45:14.46 For the normal adult, it is entirely possible for intelligence to remain in command of his
01:45:14.46 --> 01:45:20.62 behavior and for even recently acquired habits to be retained in opposition to the instinctive
01:45:20.62 --> 01:45:25.70 impulses to run or drop his rifle and play it out with his fists.
01:45:25.70 --> 01:45:30.34 There are many degrees of anger, however, and although the violently enraged individual
01:45:30.34 --> 01:45:36.70 may be at the mercy of the enemy, a milder form of resentment of injustice and calm determination
01:45:36.70 --> 01:45:44.34 to avenge cruelty, can serve to fill man with a fighting spirit that knows no defeat.
01:45:44.34 --> 01:45:49.02 The difference between this cool anger and rage is like the difference between tempered
01:45:49.02 --> 01:45:51.02 steel and molten iron.
01:45:51.02 --> 01:45:56.22 That's a good one.
01:45:56.22 --> 01:46:03.26 And the harnessed power of a Niagara that can be directed intelligently to wipe out the enemy.
01:46:03.26 --> 01:46:10.98 Such deep and controlled anger is not to be roused artificially by any group before
01:46:10.98 --> 01:46:12.34 any group of men.
01:46:12.34 --> 01:46:15.94 It is the automatic result of an un-partnable offense.
01:46:15.94 --> 01:46:20.54 It rises like an unquenchable fire when a man's house is attacked when his wife or children
01:46:20.54 --> 01:46:25.18 are abused when his own native land is invaded.
01:46:25.18 --> 01:46:30.78 Such anger can be used not only for actual killing of the enemy, but also to provide
01:46:30.78 --> 01:46:33.30 the energy needed for work behind the lines.
01:46:33.30 --> 01:46:37.54 A soldier who is determined to defeat the enemy will do anything that he feels contributes
01:46:37.54 --> 01:46:41.82 to wiping out the foe, whether it is changing the tires on a truck or unloading shells
01:46:41.82 --> 01:46:45.18 from a packing case or policing barracks in his training camp.
01:46:45.18 --> 01:46:47.74 He will fight at his job.
01:46:47.74 --> 01:46:51.86 He will do that job well and will use his own initiative to volunteer for extra duty
01:46:51.86 --> 01:46:57.26 to think up ways of doing his job more quickly and more efficiently.
01:46:57.26 --> 01:47:01.74 Anger is infectious and can spread from one person to another through personal contact.
01:47:01.74 --> 01:47:08.82 Just to see the flushed face and tense expression of a rathy person may be enough to stir
01:47:08.82 --> 01:47:10.62 anger in others.
01:47:10.62 --> 01:47:18.26 The sound of anger in a raised voice or the sight of angry behavior is even more catching.
01:47:18.26 --> 01:47:22.30 Anger spreads most readily when the beholder is sympathetic.
01:47:22.30 --> 01:47:27.18 When he's able to put himself in the angry man's shoes, when the person who is injured
01:47:27.18 --> 01:47:28.54 is one of us.
01:47:28.54 --> 01:47:34.70 For this reason, the rouse, anger of a people is much greater and more moving than the
01:47:34.70 --> 01:47:37.58 sum of the individual anger within the group.
01:47:37.58 --> 01:47:39.90 They reinforce one another.
01:47:39.90 --> 01:47:46.34 Anger shared, controlled and directed to the single purpose of destroying the enemy is a powerful
01:47:46.34 --> 01:47:53.10 force for survival and for victory.
01:47:53.10 --> 01:47:54.10 Anger is a gift.
01:47:54.10 --> 01:47:57.82 Is that a raging atmosphere?
01:47:57.82 --> 01:47:58.82 The machine is indeed.
01:47:58.82 --> 01:48:01.82 Yeah, that's bad.
01:48:01.82 --> 01:48:02.82 Bring it out.
01:48:02.82 --> 01:48:05.22 Quotes.
01:48:05.22 --> 01:48:11.70 It goes on hatred of the enemy makes sense.
01:48:11.70 --> 01:48:16.98 The army is organized throughout for one single purpose, fighting.
01:48:16.98 --> 01:48:20.42 Soldiers must be fighting men with a fighting spirit.
01:48:20.42 --> 01:48:24.98 But somehow acts of aggression by soldiers are useless to the war effort effort and actually
01:48:24.98 --> 01:48:26.74 dangerous to the army.
01:48:26.74 --> 01:48:28.94 When competition, there we go.
01:48:28.94 --> 01:48:33.42 When competition between companies or regiments turns into bitter rivalry, when soldiers
01:48:33.42 --> 01:48:38.02 in town for a Saturday night, pick calls with each other or with the town's people.
01:48:38.02 --> 01:48:43.90 When race prejudices are permitted to develop within a camp or when officers stooped professional
01:48:43.90 --> 01:48:50.34 jealousy, the harmful results can be as bad as those dealt out by the enemy.
01:48:50.34 --> 01:48:54.78 This is when life and I always say the enemy is outside the wire.
01:48:54.78 --> 01:49:00.46 This, all those things are fighting inside the wire, fighting against ourselves.
01:49:00.46 --> 01:49:04.90 Each conditions make rifts in the solidarity essential to the fighting morale.
01:49:04.90 --> 01:49:09.30 They cause a deterioration of discipline, produce a state of anxiety and insecurity among
01:49:09.30 --> 01:49:15.10 the troops and worst of all, to actually drain off in ineffective petty squabbles the fighting
01:49:15.10 --> 01:49:19.66 energy every ounce of which is needed to bring victory.
01:49:19.66 --> 01:49:25.54 The fought fal leader, knowing that no group or nation can long survive even is torn
01:49:25.54 --> 01:49:31.58 by internal strife or dissension with its allies, is seriously disturbed by any tendency
01:49:31.58 --> 01:49:38.90 toward personal or factual friction within his command.
01:49:38.90 --> 01:49:45.70 He well knows that victory can only come if the whole group puts all its efforts into a unified
01:49:45.70 --> 01:49:51.66 cooperative battle against the common enemy.
01:49:51.66 --> 01:49:59.98 You always end up with these little factions right and you have to try and prevent that.
01:49:59.98 --> 01:50:02.58 You gotta watch out for those.
01:50:02.58 --> 01:50:03.58 They sneak up on you.
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:05.38 It happens in any organization.
01:50:05.38 --> 01:50:09.54 People start to relate to each other and then they pick a little common enemy even when
01:50:09.54 --> 01:50:12.66 inside the wire and it's like the us against them.
01:50:12.66 --> 01:50:17.70 Yeah, that's true, because in picking a common enemy even on a social level whatever that
01:50:17.70 --> 01:50:25.18 like promotes cohesion within a group, like apparently from what I read is like gossip.
01:50:25.18 --> 01:50:26.54 There's a purpose for gossip.
01:50:26.54 --> 01:50:29.82 If people gossip, it makes them like bond.
01:50:29.82 --> 01:50:30.82 It's weird.
01:50:30.82 --> 01:50:31.82 Yeah, yeah, no.
01:50:31.82 --> 01:50:33.82 Actually, there's this book talks about rumors.
01:50:33.82 --> 01:50:34.82 Yeah.
01:50:34.82 --> 01:50:35.82 We're going to talk about that.
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:42.42 What are the fruitful ripe terrain for rumors to grow for gossip to grow?
01:50:42.42 --> 01:50:43.42 Yeah.
01:50:43.42 --> 01:50:44.42 But the act of doing it.
01:50:44.42 --> 01:50:45.42 Maybe that's part of the reason.
01:50:45.42 --> 01:50:50.06 Part of the reason if you and I need something to connect on, we'll just make fun of
01:50:50.06 --> 01:50:51.06 this guy.
01:50:51.06 --> 01:50:52.58 We'll talk about this guy.
01:50:52.58 --> 01:50:54.22 And we kind of bond, right?
01:50:54.22 --> 01:50:59.74 If you hate this guy and I hate this guy, we're both made when the game's saw you.
01:50:59.74 --> 01:51:06.94 So, and this says, and you say that you should you should try to prevent those little
01:51:06.94 --> 01:51:08.94 like what you click or whatever.
01:51:08.94 --> 01:51:09.94 Yeah.
01:51:09.94 --> 01:51:14.34 Is there, do you think there's benefit to them actually?
01:51:14.34 --> 01:51:17.10 There is benefit to some of those little, little, little, little.
01:51:17.10 --> 01:51:18.10 I don't know, little, little.
01:51:18.10 --> 01:51:20.02 There are benefits, but it has to be balanced.
01:51:20.02 --> 01:51:21.02 Because guess what?
01:51:21.02 --> 01:51:23.26 I'm the task unit commander of task unit bruiser.
01:51:23.26 --> 01:51:25.50 I have Charlie and Delta Patoon.
01:51:25.50 --> 01:51:30.46 I want Charlie and Delta Patoon to be competitive against each other so that they're pushing
01:51:30.46 --> 01:51:35.58 to try and become, trying make each other or trying become their best so they can talk
01:51:35.58 --> 01:51:36.58 smack to the other guys.
01:51:36.58 --> 01:51:37.58 We beat you in this thing.
01:51:37.58 --> 01:51:38.58 We beat you in that thing.
01:51:38.58 --> 01:51:39.58 Okay, cool.
01:51:39.58 --> 01:51:40.58 That's positive.
01:51:40.58 --> 01:51:42.22 I want that to happen.
01:51:42.22 --> 01:51:47.62 But I don't want is Delta Patoon figures out a good standard operating procedure and doesn't
01:51:47.62 --> 01:51:52.42 share it with Charlie Patoon because we want to keep out performing them on this drill or
01:51:52.42 --> 01:51:53.42 vice versa.
01:51:53.42 --> 01:51:54.98 That's what we don't want to have happen.
01:51:54.98 --> 01:51:56.78 So you've got to balance these dichotomies.
01:51:56.78 --> 01:51:57.78 Yes.
01:51:57.78 --> 01:51:58.98 And you want to have these little competitive groups.
01:51:58.98 --> 01:51:59.98 And inside, guess what?
01:51:59.98 --> 01:52:02.86 Inside of Charlie Patoon, there's squad one and squad two.
01:52:02.86 --> 01:52:04.78 They should compete with each other.
01:52:04.78 --> 01:52:09.58 And inside squad one and squad two, inside squad one, you got Fire Team one and Fire Team
01:52:09.58 --> 01:52:10.58 two.
01:52:10.58 --> 01:52:11.58 And they're competing with each other.
01:52:11.58 --> 01:52:14.18 And then inside that Fire Team, we got two swim pairs.
01:52:14.18 --> 01:52:15.54 And they're competing with each other.
01:52:15.54 --> 01:52:20.26 So you want to establish that healthy competition.
01:52:20.26 --> 01:52:26.26 But what you want to make sure is that it doesn't cross the boundary into sabotage.
01:52:26.26 --> 01:52:27.26 Right.
01:52:27.26 --> 01:52:28.26 Yeah.
01:52:28.26 --> 01:52:32.06 So it's like it has to remain at all times.
01:52:32.06 --> 01:52:39.50 Has to remain within the boundary of the team goal.
01:52:39.50 --> 01:52:41.06 Like he can never cross over that.
01:52:41.06 --> 01:52:42.06 Right.
01:52:42.06 --> 01:52:44.06 Like it has to be.
01:52:44.06 --> 01:52:46.10 It all has to support the team goal.
01:52:46.10 --> 01:52:47.10 Right.
01:52:47.10 --> 01:52:48.10 Whatever.
01:52:48.10 --> 01:52:49.10 Yes.
01:52:49.10 --> 01:52:56.58 Like it never be taking away from the fact that we have a unified mission to execute and achieve.
01:52:56.58 --> 01:53:02.06 We can never let anything undermine that goal.
01:53:02.06 --> 01:53:03.06 Yeah.
01:53:03.06 --> 01:53:04.06 Ever.
01:53:04.06 --> 01:53:08.62 And that right there.
01:53:08.62 --> 01:53:11.22 We throw around this term, putting the mission first.
01:53:11.22 --> 01:53:12.22 Right.
01:53:12.22 --> 01:53:13.22 Like, oh, you got to put the mission first.
01:53:13.22 --> 01:53:14.94 We throw that around.
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:22.82 But if you think that through to its ultimate end, it is the most powerful force that you
01:53:22.82 --> 01:53:29.26 can have from a leadership perspective, from the way that you operate and the decisions
01:53:29.26 --> 01:53:30.26 that you make.
01:53:30.26 --> 01:53:33.38 Because you look at some decision that get needs to get made.
01:53:33.38 --> 01:53:38.38 And if you truly ask yourself the question, okay.
01:53:38.38 --> 01:53:43.38 How will this move us towards our objective in a positive way?
01:53:43.38 --> 01:53:45.94 If it will, okay, we're moving in the right direction.
01:53:45.94 --> 01:53:46.94 Sounds like a day.
01:53:46.94 --> 01:53:51.22 If it's not doing that, it's the wrong decision to make.
01:53:51.22 --> 01:53:55.34 And so it comes time to fire someone.
01:53:55.34 --> 01:53:59.90 You're firing this person because they talk back to you and they were, they got a bad
01:53:59.90 --> 01:54:00.90 attitude.
01:54:00.90 --> 01:54:01.90 Okay.
01:54:01.90 --> 01:54:04.10 So then you ask yourself, okay, what does this do to our mission?
01:54:04.10 --> 01:54:06.26 Our ability to execute our mission.
01:54:06.26 --> 01:54:11.14 Well, the guy's a turd and he doesn't know his job well and he's been slacking off,
01:54:11.14 --> 01:54:13.26 okay, and no one likes him.
01:54:13.26 --> 01:54:14.26 Guess what?
01:54:14.26 --> 01:54:15.26 He's getting fired.
01:54:15.26 --> 01:54:16.98 But okay, wait a second.
01:54:16.98 --> 01:54:18.82 I don't like him.
01:54:18.82 --> 01:54:21.26 I don't like him because he rubs me the wrong way.
01:54:21.26 --> 01:54:24.42 I don't like him because he's got a big ego, which means he's brushing up against
01:54:24.42 --> 01:54:27.54 my big ego, which is making me hold it against him.
01:54:27.54 --> 01:54:30.06 And by the way, he's come up with a couple of ideas that were better than mine and
01:54:30.06 --> 01:54:31.70 I resent him for that.
01:54:31.70 --> 01:54:35.94 And by the way, he's asked some questions during my last brief that were really hard
01:54:35.94 --> 01:54:36.94 for me to answer.
01:54:36.94 --> 01:54:37.94 He kind of put me on the spot, right?
01:54:37.94 --> 01:54:39.66 So all these things.
01:54:39.66 --> 01:54:43.26 And so I rack those things up and I start, and now I put together my little click, who's
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:44.26 now I starts in.
01:54:44.26 --> 01:54:47.70 He did this and he did this on this op and all this and I got a reason.
01:54:47.70 --> 01:54:48.70 Yeah.
01:54:48.70 --> 01:54:52.90 And now I need to ask myself, okay, am I furthering the mission?
01:54:52.90 --> 01:54:54.42 If I get rid of who's going to replace him.
01:54:54.42 --> 01:54:56.98 He has experience, who's going to replace that experience.
01:54:56.98 --> 01:55:00.58 He's another body who's going to replace that other body.
01:55:00.58 --> 01:55:05.26 And so if you make your decisions based on what's good for the team, by the way, what's
01:55:05.26 --> 01:55:07.34 good for the team is what's good for the mission.
01:55:07.34 --> 01:55:08.86 You have a team to accomplish the mission.
01:55:08.86 --> 01:55:11.58 If your team is dysfunctional, you're not going to accomplish the mission.
01:55:11.58 --> 01:55:16.98 If your team is destroyed or part of your team is lost, you can't accomplish the mission.
01:55:16.98 --> 01:55:23.34 So if you really truly look is what I'm doing accomplisher, what about your family, right?
01:55:23.34 --> 01:55:27.50 Your family mission is to provide for your family and take care of your family.
01:55:27.50 --> 01:55:33.34 When you start looking at things from that standpoint, hey, I really want to get this new
01:55:33.34 --> 01:55:34.34 car.
01:55:34.34 --> 01:55:35.34 Yeah.
01:55:35.34 --> 01:55:36.34 Right?
01:55:36.34 --> 01:55:38.34 I really like this new car.
01:55:38.34 --> 01:55:39.34 Sure.
01:55:39.34 --> 01:55:41.82 Okay, we know that that's an emotional decision.
01:55:41.82 --> 01:55:44.70 Buying cars for most people is a emotional decision.
01:55:44.70 --> 01:55:46.90 Myself included.
01:55:46.90 --> 01:55:51.46 Americans, as I'm just Americans, people, love cars.
01:55:51.46 --> 01:55:58.94 I don't know if it's because the advertising thing, but cars represent freedom.
01:55:58.94 --> 01:56:05.82 You have the ability to travel hundreds and thousands of miles on your own accord.
01:56:05.82 --> 01:56:11.42 And maybe you just need to travel to the grocery market, but still the car gives you freedom.
01:56:11.42 --> 01:56:15.82 And then the car in a deeper level is a reflection of you.
01:56:15.82 --> 01:56:16.82 Yeah, you're a identity.
01:56:16.82 --> 01:56:17.82 It's true.
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:21.94 Yeah, this is it's literally something that you get inside of.
01:56:21.94 --> 01:56:28.62 And when people look at it, they're looking at the metal and steel version of you.
01:56:28.62 --> 01:56:29.62 Your own mind.
01:56:29.62 --> 01:56:30.62 Yes.
01:56:30.62 --> 01:56:40.14 So it can be hard to drive a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan with an duct tape on the window.
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:41.14 It can be hard.
01:56:41.14 --> 01:56:45.58 The fires, the fires in San Diego in 2003, were you here for those?
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:47.46 Yes, they poured ash everywhere.
01:56:47.46 --> 01:56:48.86 So that ruined a lot of paint.
01:56:48.86 --> 01:56:54.18 If the cars were sitting outside, so my 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan had all peeled paint.
01:56:54.18 --> 01:56:58.30 Look like just horrible.
01:56:58.30 --> 01:57:03.50 The old paint is like a dark red, but then there were these flakes of clear stuff all
01:57:03.50 --> 01:57:06.02 over it falling off.
01:57:06.02 --> 01:57:12.62 So if you looked at that car and I saw that car as a reflection of me, it was pretty
01:57:12.62 --> 01:57:18.22 low reflection, nothing gets my brothers out there that are driving the many vans.
01:57:18.22 --> 01:57:19.22 Props.
01:57:19.22 --> 01:57:20.22 You got the family.
01:57:20.22 --> 01:57:21.70 You make that your priority.
01:57:21.70 --> 01:57:28.70 Because what I could have done back in the day was say, you know what, I really want to get
01:57:28.70 --> 01:57:29.70 whatever.
01:57:29.70 --> 01:57:38.58 The Ford F350 Super Duty Doole Extended King Cab.
01:57:38.58 --> 01:57:39.58 You know what I'm saying?
01:57:39.58 --> 01:57:40.58 Look, trim.
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:41.98 That's me.
01:57:41.98 --> 01:57:45.14 I want to look like that on the outside.
01:57:45.14 --> 01:57:46.78 So then what is my decision making, bro?
01:57:46.78 --> 01:57:47.78 Do I need that vehicle?
01:57:47.78 --> 01:57:50.38 I live in San Diego by the way.
01:57:50.38 --> 01:57:52.18 I live in San Diego.
01:57:52.18 --> 01:57:53.18 What do I do with my vehicle?
01:57:53.18 --> 01:57:54.18 I drive to work.
01:57:54.18 --> 01:57:55.18 I drive home.
01:57:55.18 --> 01:57:57.26 I take my kids to the Jitsu tournaments.
01:57:57.26 --> 01:57:58.78 That's what I do with my vehicle.
01:57:58.78 --> 01:58:06.10 Do I need a F350 Super Duty Doole Extended Cab Diesel 7.3 Power Stroke Engine.
01:58:06.10 --> 01:58:07.10 Do I need that?
01:58:07.10 --> 01:58:08.10 I don't know.
01:58:08.10 --> 01:58:09.10 Kind of.
01:58:09.10 --> 01:58:10.10 No.
01:58:10.10 --> 01:58:11.10 I don't.
01:58:11.10 --> 01:58:12.10 So what is the mission?
01:58:12.10 --> 01:58:13.10 What is the mission?
01:58:13.10 --> 01:58:16.50 First of all, we know that when I buy a car, it's going down in value.
01:58:16.50 --> 01:58:22.38 I buy a piece of property, I buy a house, I buy a home that's going to go up in value.
01:58:22.38 --> 01:58:25.70 Over time, sure, it might go up and down a little bit, but over time it's going to go
01:58:25.70 --> 01:58:26.70 up in value.
01:58:26.70 --> 01:58:32.66 Over time, my kids can have that in 30 years that they don't want that Ford in 30
01:58:32.66 --> 01:58:33.66 years.
01:58:33.66 --> 01:58:35.86 That things barely even run in 30 years.
01:58:35.86 --> 01:58:37.94 So what is my mission?
01:58:37.94 --> 01:58:41.46 My mission is to provide for the family, protect the family, take care of the family,
01:58:41.46 --> 01:58:44.54 set them up for success in the future.
01:58:44.54 --> 01:58:46.02 What do I need to drive?
01:58:46.02 --> 01:58:48.86 I need to drive a Dodge Caravan.
01:58:48.86 --> 01:58:50.50 That's what I need to drive.
01:58:50.50 --> 01:58:51.50 I understand.
01:58:51.50 --> 01:58:56.94 So if you frame things correctly about what your broad mission is, you're going to do
01:58:56.94 --> 01:58:59.62 better off, you're going to make better decisions as a leader.
01:58:59.62 --> 01:59:02.42 That's the way it's going to be.
01:59:02.42 --> 01:59:07.42 Oh.
01:59:07.42 --> 01:59:14.62 And by the way, speaking of leaders, here we go back to the book.
01:59:14.62 --> 01:59:23.34 The most serious of all causes for an epidemic of dissension is the bad leader.
01:59:23.34 --> 01:59:28.78 When, as sometimes happens in any organization like an army, men have placed over them
01:59:28.78 --> 01:59:31.58 a man, they do not trust.
01:59:31.58 --> 01:59:39.82 One who loves to show his authority and throw his rank around on unreasonable, martinette.
01:59:39.82 --> 01:59:43.82 The whole outfit will be filled with resentment.
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:48.22 This is impossible to show this antagonism to the officer who is at fault.
01:59:48.22 --> 01:59:52.82 The troops go around with chips on their shoulders, daring each other to knock them off.
01:59:52.82 --> 01:59:57.66 The only way to wipe out such an infection of dissension is to track down and remove the
01:59:57.66 --> 01:59:58.66 cause.
01:59:58.66 --> 02:00:04.82 If men believe they have a grievance, even if the complaint is unjustified, they should
02:00:04.82 --> 02:00:09.26 be permitted to tell their troubles to someone in authority.
02:00:09.26 --> 02:00:14.98 If an officer gives them a patient hearing, investigates conditions with a fair and open
02:00:14.98 --> 02:00:19.34 mind and explains his findings to the men, they will usually be satisfied.
02:00:19.34 --> 02:00:24.90 Even in cases where it is impossible to do much to correct the objectionable state of affairs.
02:00:24.90 --> 02:00:26.94 This is such good advice.
02:00:26.94 --> 02:00:27.94 Guess what?
02:00:27.94 --> 02:00:30.86 When you're in a leadership position, you're going to have people that are going to complain
02:00:30.86 --> 02:00:32.98 about things they're going to see problems.
02:00:32.98 --> 02:00:37.42 And what you should do in those situations is less than.
02:00:37.42 --> 02:00:42.66 Listen to what the team has to say, listen to what that individual has to say.
02:00:42.66 --> 02:00:44.94 Get feedback.
02:00:44.94 --> 02:00:47.34 That's what you should do.
02:00:47.34 --> 02:00:52.26 Back to the book, just telling their troubles to a willing listener serves to get the air
02:00:52.26 --> 02:00:53.26 cleared.
02:00:53.26 --> 02:00:58.30 And in cases where men make constructive suggestions for correcting conditions, they will
02:00:58.30 --> 02:01:02.90 take in the organization a pride that they never had before.
02:01:02.90 --> 02:01:04.82 So, guys, tell us what you're doing.
02:01:04.82 --> 02:01:08.02 Listen up, that I asked you to do something to give suggestions, use it and get them
02:01:08.02 --> 02:01:10.02 credit.
02:01:10.02 --> 02:01:14.50 These are reasons why for many years in our army, any officer or soldier has been free
02:01:14.50 --> 02:01:19.06 to telegrevens to the Inspector General said periodically to each place where there are
02:01:19.06 --> 02:01:20.06 troops.
02:01:20.06 --> 02:01:26.06 Inspector General's like an internal affairs type situation.
02:01:26.06 --> 02:01:28.50 But you should need to resort to that.
02:01:28.50 --> 02:01:32.30 If you're a good commander and a good leader when the internal affairs people show up, they
02:01:32.30 --> 02:01:34.50 get told, hey, everything's awesome.
02:01:34.50 --> 02:01:38.42 They have no grievances to put out there because they already told you and then you gave
02:01:38.42 --> 02:01:40.02 them an answer.
02:01:40.02 --> 02:01:42.06 And then people say, what if I can't answer the grievances?
02:01:42.06 --> 02:01:44.42 Well, then you figure out what the answer is.
02:01:44.42 --> 02:01:50.54 If my subordinate comes to me and says, hey, this is, we're not getting the right food
02:01:50.54 --> 02:01:51.54 out here.
02:01:51.54 --> 02:01:53.82 Well, I don't want to say, well, sorry.
02:01:53.82 --> 02:01:55.74 No, I say, okay, let me see what I can do about it.
02:01:55.74 --> 02:01:56.94 Hey, this is what's going on.
02:01:56.94 --> 02:02:00.54 By the way, there's a lack of flight, heading in this direction.
02:02:00.54 --> 02:02:04.18 The supply trains are getting blown up by IEDs.
02:02:04.18 --> 02:02:06.18 We have an alternate plan for food.
02:02:06.18 --> 02:02:09.22 We're going to try and make it happen in a couple months, but right now we kind of got
02:02:09.22 --> 02:02:11.10 what we got.
02:02:11.10 --> 02:02:12.10 And now what do you say?
02:02:12.10 --> 02:02:13.10 You screw you?
02:02:13.10 --> 02:02:15.42 No, you go, okay, I understand.
02:02:15.42 --> 02:02:17.86 We're at war for a kind of all out.
02:02:17.86 --> 02:02:21.30 I understand I'm not going to get steak dinner every night.
02:02:21.30 --> 02:02:23.30 It's not happening.
02:02:23.30 --> 02:02:26.78 Even though we might want it, we're not going to get it.
02:02:26.78 --> 02:02:32.50 So here are those grievances.
02:02:32.50 --> 02:02:42.10 It, some people get concerned that if you start taking grievances from people, then it turns
02:02:42.10 --> 02:02:44.10 into a bitch session.
02:02:44.10 --> 02:02:45.10 Right?
02:02:45.10 --> 02:02:47.50 You heard this word, this term before.
02:02:47.50 --> 02:02:49.14 The bitch session.
02:02:49.14 --> 02:02:53.38 I'm actually in general, not scared of bitch sessions.
02:02:53.38 --> 02:03:00.14 I'm not scared of them because if you ask me a good question, or you ask me a question,
02:03:00.14 --> 02:03:01.14 I should have an answer for it.
02:03:01.14 --> 02:03:02.46 I'm the leader.
02:03:02.46 --> 02:03:07.66 If you're in my platoon and you have a question for me, I should be able to answer.
02:03:07.66 --> 02:03:12.38 If you have a bitch, I should be able to give you a reason why that is occurring.
02:03:12.38 --> 02:03:16.34 And why we either can move forward with some kind of a corrective measure or why we cannot
02:03:16.34 --> 02:03:19.98 because the following limitations that were under.
02:03:19.98 --> 02:03:26.18 So I'm not really scared of bitch sessions unfolding.
02:03:26.18 --> 02:03:28.18 Have I seen them become unproductive?
02:03:28.18 --> 02:03:29.18 Absolutely.
02:03:29.18 --> 02:03:36.78 Especially see them become unproductive when we start to like lose the conversation.
02:03:36.78 --> 02:03:43.66 And if the leader, if you ask me a question and I say because, if you say, hey, why can't
02:03:43.66 --> 02:03:45.54 we get better food?
02:03:45.54 --> 02:03:49.94 And I say because then you say because of what?
02:03:49.94 --> 02:03:52.30 And I say because I said so.
02:03:52.30 --> 02:03:53.66 Now we're going to have a problem.
02:03:53.66 --> 02:03:56.98 Now this bitch session just became unproductive.
02:03:56.98 --> 02:04:00.18 If you say hey, Jocco, we've been here for two months.
02:04:00.18 --> 02:04:01.34 Why can't we get some better food?
02:04:01.34 --> 02:04:02.62 I'm like, you know what?
02:04:02.62 --> 02:04:06.18 Right now I don't even know because I agree with you.
02:04:06.18 --> 02:04:08.94 The food is pretty bad and I like food.
02:04:08.94 --> 02:04:10.34 And so let me take a note here.
02:04:10.34 --> 02:04:12.30 I'm going to write down what I've sent it up to chain of command.
02:04:12.30 --> 02:04:14.38 We can figure out, what's going on?
02:04:14.38 --> 02:04:18.74 Why we don't get to have good food and be if there's a way we can possibly start making
02:04:18.74 --> 02:04:19.74 this happen.
02:04:19.74 --> 02:04:22.18 I hear you.
02:04:22.18 --> 02:04:24.50 Bitch is now subdued.
02:04:24.50 --> 02:04:25.50 Right?
02:04:25.50 --> 02:04:29.94 I mean, has been subdued because I gave you a legitimate answer.
02:04:29.94 --> 02:04:32.54 I didn't even give you a solution by any stretch.
02:04:32.54 --> 02:04:33.54 I just gave you an answer.
02:04:33.54 --> 02:04:37.54 I just took your information and heard what you had to say, which is legitimate.
02:04:37.54 --> 02:04:44.22 I've seen people where they they they they send up a complaint and then they get subdued.
02:04:44.22 --> 02:04:46.94 But then the the leader doesn't follow up on the complaint.
02:04:46.94 --> 02:04:50.10 I don't follow up and actually go up the chain of command and say why don't we get
02:04:50.10 --> 02:04:52.62 better food.
02:04:52.62 --> 02:04:53.62 That's going to be a problem.
02:04:53.62 --> 02:04:54.90 Next session.
02:04:54.90 --> 02:04:59.46 Hey, you said you're going to do some what's the answer and I say well, I'll I'll
02:04:59.46 --> 02:05:03.26 I'll but the bit now you're bad.
02:05:03.26 --> 02:05:05.54 Rightfully so.
02:05:05.54 --> 02:05:06.94 And that's really it.
02:05:06.94 --> 02:05:11.14 That's really that what tells the tale because I go case of bitch session.
02:05:11.14 --> 02:05:12.14 Right.
02:05:12.14 --> 02:05:17.38 That'll I mean along with complaints come what I think is more important than like the
02:05:17.38 --> 02:05:22.38 complaint or the issue that's complain about more important is the motivation to complain.
02:05:22.38 --> 02:05:25.34 So let's say the food is junk.
02:05:25.34 --> 02:05:26.34 Right.
02:05:26.34 --> 02:05:31.50 If I think if I'm mad about that, if that bothers me whether because I think the food should
02:05:31.50 --> 02:05:32.82 literally be better.
02:05:32.82 --> 02:05:34.14 It should be better right now.
02:05:34.14 --> 02:05:35.14 Yeah.
02:05:35.14 --> 02:05:37.50 I don't know why it's better right now, but I think it should be in that makes that
02:05:37.50 --> 02:05:42.50 bothers me at the very least that produces a motivation to complain.
02:05:42.50 --> 02:05:44.90 But if the food can be just as bad.
02:05:44.90 --> 02:05:48.82 But if I have an explanation, I have no motivation to complain because I'm mad at
02:05:48.82 --> 02:05:50.14 that it's understandable.
02:05:50.14 --> 02:05:57.10 So a bitch session will develop when those feeling those motivations to complain are
02:05:57.10 --> 02:05:58.70 maintained or escalated.
02:05:58.70 --> 02:06:01.42 So like if you're like so, why?
02:06:01.42 --> 02:06:03.70 Because I said so I'm still mad.
02:06:03.70 --> 02:06:04.70 Totally.
02:06:04.70 --> 02:06:08.74 But I'm not even a little bit more mad because the way you said that to.
02:06:08.74 --> 02:06:11.58 So that's when those bitch bitch sessions will come.
02:06:11.58 --> 02:06:16.26 Or if you get a couple of people making the same complaint and then another couple of people
02:06:16.26 --> 02:06:19.26 like kind of refuting it or something like that.
02:06:19.26 --> 02:06:24.42 Or anywhere where there's emotions kind of, and one key factor that you brought up is the
02:06:24.42 --> 02:06:26.54 building up.
02:06:26.54 --> 02:06:30.66 If you're constantly communicating with your people, then the bitch sessions don't build
02:06:30.66 --> 02:06:31.66 up.
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:35.86 It's when you decide, when do you block yourself in your own vacuum and you don't listen
02:06:35.86 --> 02:06:39.94 to what anyone has to say and then once every six months you go, hey guys, we're going
02:06:39.94 --> 02:06:41.18 to have a Q&A.
02:06:41.18 --> 02:06:44.10 If you guys have any questions for me, you guys can come in there.
02:06:44.10 --> 02:06:45.10 You guys can ask me questions.
02:06:45.10 --> 02:06:47.14 Well these guys have been brewing up questions for the last six months.
02:06:47.14 --> 02:06:48.14 They've been drinking.
02:06:48.14 --> 02:06:52.06 They've got some questions, boy, and they're going to hit you with a mark.
02:06:52.06 --> 02:06:58.06 So you, that if you want to prevent the bitch session from getting out of control, guess
02:06:58.06 --> 02:07:00.26 what, communicate with your people more often.
02:07:00.26 --> 02:07:02.98 It'll take that question about why is the food so bad?
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:07.74 By the time it's six months deep and that guy's been eating crappy food for six months,
02:07:07.74 --> 02:07:11.02 there's almost no solution that you can provide that's going to be good for him.
02:07:11.02 --> 02:07:13.06 By the way, you wasted six months of trying to find a solution.
02:07:13.06 --> 02:07:14.46 So that's just wrong.
02:07:14.46 --> 02:07:21.02 So you're already starting off with really negative situation.
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:22.94 So communicate with your people a lot.
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:23.94 Don't be afraid.
02:07:23.94 --> 02:07:26.94 If you, if they ask me a question, I don't know the answer to.
02:07:26.94 --> 02:07:27.94 Cool.
02:07:27.94 --> 02:07:29.22 You say, hey, let me write this down.
02:07:29.22 --> 02:07:31.42 Let me run this up to Chainedic Command and find out what's going on with that because
02:07:31.42 --> 02:07:32.42 I don't know the answer.
02:07:32.42 --> 02:07:39.10 What if they ask me a question that I don't like the answer to?
02:07:39.10 --> 02:07:40.10 I don't like this.
02:07:40.10 --> 02:07:42.10 I don't like what I've been told.
02:07:42.10 --> 02:07:43.10 Wait, you have the leader.
02:07:43.10 --> 02:07:48.18 I'm as the leader and someone says, I get told, hey, you're not getting food because
02:07:48.18 --> 02:07:52.34 we prioritize one of the other potoons and they're getting all the steak, which by the way,
02:07:52.34 --> 02:07:53.82 would never happen.
02:07:53.82 --> 02:07:58.62 But if they did that and then someone says, hey, why are we getting this bad food?
02:07:58.62 --> 02:08:01.22 And I go, well, it's because they gave it to you on the potoon.
02:08:01.22 --> 02:08:06.22 I wouldn't say, I would answer the question truthfully, which is like, listen, this
02:08:06.22 --> 02:08:07.34 is what's going on right now.
02:08:07.34 --> 02:08:11.62 For some reason, they gave the other potoon all the steak.
02:08:11.62 --> 02:08:16.98 Believe me, we have no greater champion for steak in this potoon than me.
02:08:16.98 --> 02:08:22.22 I am personally flying to see the boss and I'm going to figure out what's going on.
02:08:22.22 --> 02:08:23.22 We will get steak.
02:08:23.22 --> 02:08:24.22 You know what I mean?
02:08:24.22 --> 02:08:28.22 As opposed to just being mad or not wanting to give the answer, trying to hide it, I don't
02:08:28.22 --> 02:08:29.22 know what's going on.
02:08:29.22 --> 02:08:30.46 I don't know why we're not getting steak.
02:08:30.46 --> 02:08:31.54 You know why you're not getting steak?
02:08:31.54 --> 02:08:32.54 Tell everyone.
02:08:32.54 --> 02:08:33.54 Yeah.
02:08:33.54 --> 02:08:34.54 Don't.
02:08:34.54 --> 02:08:35.54 The more open you are.
02:08:35.54 --> 02:08:38.82 And of course, there's a dichotomy to this too because we can go too far and telling the truth.
02:08:38.82 --> 02:08:43.06 We can tell people the truth about things that they don't need to know about, right?
02:08:43.06 --> 02:08:44.06 Yeah.
02:08:44.06 --> 02:08:47.34 So you do have to be careful about that.
02:08:47.34 --> 02:08:48.34 You have to be careful.
02:08:48.34 --> 02:08:51.66 You have to be judicious in telling the truth.
02:08:51.66 --> 02:08:58.42 You have to make sure that it makes sense in accomplishing the long term mission.
02:08:58.42 --> 02:09:03.22 If I tell everyone that we're not getting food because we got caught off and we're
02:09:03.22 --> 02:09:08.70 out here on our own and we have about three days worth of food and water and by the
02:09:08.70 --> 02:09:10.70 way we're not going to live and we're all going to die.
02:09:10.70 --> 02:09:11.70 Yeah.
02:09:11.70 --> 02:09:12.70 So we should be happy with this.
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:16.34 That's that's that's not going to help my mission.
02:09:16.34 --> 02:09:19.90 Now I could I could turn that into something that says listen, what here's going on right
02:09:19.90 --> 02:09:24.18 now we're caught off and here's the mission of going to undertake to make this happen.
02:09:24.18 --> 02:09:27.82 That's probably not a great example, but I think we all understand that there's times
02:09:27.82 --> 02:09:32.14 if you screw up a video, if you put a video together for me and it's got the worst
02:09:32.14 --> 02:09:33.70 Christmas music to the video.
02:09:33.70 --> 02:09:34.70 Another terrible example.
02:09:34.70 --> 02:09:35.70 Yeah.
02:09:35.70 --> 02:09:37.98 I don't just drop the hammer on you and say you suck it at it.
02:09:37.98 --> 02:09:39.98 You know, I kind of think that at the moment.
02:09:39.98 --> 02:09:43.98 Instead I say hey, I like what you put together, you know, maybe can you explain why you did
02:09:43.98 --> 02:09:44.98 this music selection?
02:09:44.98 --> 02:09:47.98 Because for me it's a little bit different than what I would expect.
02:09:47.98 --> 02:09:48.98 Sure.
02:09:48.98 --> 02:09:49.98 Yeah.
02:09:49.98 --> 02:09:51.98 Thank you for that.
02:09:51.98 --> 02:09:52.98 Check.
02:09:52.98 --> 02:09:56.98 Going back to the book incidentally, but most important.
02:09:56.98 --> 02:10:00.98 I keep adding emphasis to things that are literally not this book.
02:10:00.98 --> 02:10:05.98 So what that actually says is incidentally but importantly, it doesn't say most important.
02:10:05.98 --> 02:10:06.98 I added that.
02:10:06.98 --> 02:10:07.98 It's not.
02:10:07.98 --> 02:10:08.98 There's a second time I've done that.
02:10:08.98 --> 02:10:11.98 I've taken something to the next level even though just on my own accord.
02:10:11.98 --> 02:10:13.98 Pay your phone just being right.
02:10:13.98 --> 02:10:21.50 So what it says is incidentally in parentheses, but importantly, this method of dealing
02:10:21.50 --> 02:10:27.38 with this fact, dissatisfaction cheats the fifth columnist and solbit saboteur who made
02:10:27.38 --> 02:10:29.38 lurk in the camp.
02:10:29.38 --> 02:10:33.42 It is much safer for the army that mentioned poor their gripes into the ears of an
02:10:33.42 --> 02:10:38.74 officer than that they should spill them in a beer joint in town or in any other place where
02:10:38.74 --> 02:10:40.94 outsiders can listen.
02:10:40.94 --> 02:10:46.38 Another method of handling dissension and over aggression is by punishment.
02:10:46.38 --> 02:10:53.94 This is the chosen method of dictatorships and auto-cratic organizations generally.
02:10:53.94 --> 02:10:58.82 The method is commonly used even in America and most children have to learn that when
02:10:58.82 --> 02:11:02.62 they feel aggressive punishment is not that far away.
02:11:02.62 --> 02:11:09.14 So another thing you can do in somebody asks, you know a question, hey, Jocco, can you tell
02:11:09.14 --> 02:11:10.14 us why we're not getting any stake?
02:11:10.14 --> 02:11:11.54 I'll tell you why.
02:11:11.54 --> 02:11:13.30 We're not getting stake because you haven't worked hard enough.
02:11:13.30 --> 02:11:14.30 Guess what you're doing tonight.
02:11:14.30 --> 02:11:17.86 K-P-Doodie or whatever.
02:11:17.86 --> 02:11:22.86 When I punish you for asking your question, that's like what auto-crats do.
02:11:22.86 --> 02:11:24.86 Dictators do that.
02:11:24.86 --> 02:11:25.86 Back to the book.
02:11:25.86 --> 02:11:30.58 Sometimes the soldiers troubles cannot be attributed to anyone person.
02:11:30.58 --> 02:11:34.38 They are due to the conditions of war or of army life.
02:11:34.38 --> 02:11:39.26 An ambitious and energetic man may find himself so wound up and red tape that he cannot
02:11:39.26 --> 02:11:40.26 do a good job.
02:11:40.26 --> 02:11:44.58 An organization may be all set to go forward to an objective but is hindered by failure
02:11:44.58 --> 02:11:47.82 of supplies by shortages, by weather.
02:11:47.82 --> 02:11:48.98 No one is to blame.
02:11:48.98 --> 02:11:55.22 Which I kind of disagree with that statement because I was here in charge of that.
02:11:55.22 --> 02:11:57.58 If you're in charge of that, then guess what?
02:11:57.58 --> 02:12:00.42 You should have figured out how to get the supplies there in time.
02:12:00.42 --> 02:12:02.42 You should have figured out a contingency plan for the weather.
02:12:02.42 --> 02:12:09.42 But what they're talking about is sometimes things go wrong and continuing on.
02:12:09.42 --> 02:12:13.58 This natural need for someone to blame and punish when things go wrong.
02:12:13.58 --> 02:12:20.66 Responsible for much race and religious prejudice is also the cause for most corals that
02:12:20.66 --> 02:12:25.38 grow up between allies and between one branch of the service and another.
02:12:25.38 --> 02:12:28.86 So when you have these inner service rivalries, because there's no one else to blame,
02:12:28.86 --> 02:12:38.90 you have organizations where the production guys, the sales guys are selling stuff and
02:12:38.90 --> 02:12:43.74 the builders of the stuff, the engineers that design the stuff aren't getting it to
02:12:43.74 --> 02:12:46.18 them in time.
02:12:46.18 --> 02:12:47.58 When they're getting it to them in time, that's fine.
02:12:47.58 --> 02:12:52.42 But this the market is down and they start to hate none each other when they should be
02:12:52.42 --> 02:12:58.02 focusing on how to adjust to the market adaptations that need to be made or the market adjustments
02:12:58.02 --> 02:13:01.38 that need to be made and said they're going at each other's throats.
02:13:01.38 --> 02:13:02.38 Why?
02:13:02.38 --> 02:13:04.30 Because they're looking for someone to blame.
02:13:04.30 --> 02:13:05.94 No one look for someone to blame.
02:13:05.94 --> 02:13:09.38 Figure out what the problem is and solve it.
02:13:09.38 --> 02:13:14.18 Back the book, an occasional individual in any large group appears to contradict all the rules
02:13:14.18 --> 02:13:16.94 about how aggression was built up.
02:13:16.94 --> 02:13:21.38 He will turn nasty when he's, this is a really interesting psychological profile.
02:13:21.38 --> 02:13:22.86 So I'm going to read this again.
02:13:22.86 --> 02:13:27.98 An occasional individual in any large group appears to contradict all the rules about
02:13:27.98 --> 02:13:30.14 how aggression was built up.
02:13:30.14 --> 02:13:36.22 He will turn nasty when he is treated with kindness and becomes very docile under punishment
02:13:36.22 --> 02:13:37.70 or frustration.
02:13:37.70 --> 02:13:42.54 He is excessively polite and cooperative as long as he is kept in a subordinate position,
02:13:42.54 --> 02:13:47.34 but when he is put in command of other man, he becomes tyrannical and overbearing.
02:13:47.34 --> 02:13:52.38 Such peculiar behaviors often result of two severe punishment of self-assertion or aggressiveness
02:13:52.38 --> 02:13:54.66 in childhood.
02:13:54.66 --> 02:13:58.54 This man is carrying around his own grouches and resentments, bottled up inside of him.
02:13:58.54 --> 02:14:02.34 He is deeply anxious to punish and hurt other people, but as long as he is faced with
02:14:02.34 --> 02:14:07.06 a threat of punishment himself, he retains his childhood fear of showing his feelings.
02:14:07.06 --> 02:14:11.62 As soon as other people treat him decently and no longer appear like a threat to him,
02:14:11.62 --> 02:14:14.62 then his meanness lashes out.
02:14:14.62 --> 02:14:20.54 People who have this curious reversal of normal reaction to other people's kindness or aggressiveness
02:14:20.54 --> 02:14:25.62 often like to boast that they are tough or hard and that they respect a man who will stand
02:14:25.62 --> 02:14:27.22 up to them.
02:14:27.22 --> 02:14:32.06 This boast is an explanation that fools many people, even including the explainer and
02:14:32.06 --> 02:14:33.06 self.
02:14:33.06 --> 02:14:37.74 Actually the respect they claim to feel is nothing but an unconscious fear, a secret
02:14:37.74 --> 02:14:42.42 fear that the rebellious subordinate will punish them.
02:14:42.42 --> 02:14:44.74 Such men make poor leaders.
02:14:44.74 --> 02:14:48.50 They make their subordinates angry and uncooperative.
02:14:48.50 --> 02:14:53.22 They work best when alone.
02:14:53.22 --> 02:15:04.58 And this continues on, the good leader is not afraid of criticism from his subordinates.
02:15:04.58 --> 02:15:05.58 Amen.
02:15:05.58 --> 02:15:07.42 I guess is what I would say to that.
02:15:07.42 --> 02:15:11.22 A good leader is not afraid of criticism from the subordinates.
02:15:11.22 --> 02:15:17.70 He will encourage it as a constructive and cooperative way of eliminating causes for resentment
02:15:17.70 --> 02:15:19.54 and dissension.
02:15:19.54 --> 02:15:23.10 And he will use it himself in dealing with his subordinates, but the criticism should
02:15:23.10 --> 02:15:28.70 be constructive and directed at some true cause of the difficulty not some imagined evil
02:15:28.70 --> 02:15:31.94 or some harmless and defentheless person of the group.
02:15:31.94 --> 02:15:36.14 It should not be a means of passing the buck.
02:15:36.14 --> 02:15:38.98 Here are some rules for critics to keep in mind.
02:15:38.98 --> 02:15:45.74 So when you want to start throwing darts at the old man, one stick to things that can be
02:15:45.74 --> 02:15:46.74 corrected.
02:15:46.74 --> 02:15:50.50 Don't criticize dead issues or unalterable situations.
02:15:50.50 --> 02:15:52.78 You even know some people just get stuck.
02:15:52.78 --> 02:15:56.62 They get stuck on something and they'll just never let it go.
02:15:56.62 --> 02:15:58.58 Hey, that happened three months ago.
02:15:58.58 --> 02:16:00.38 I get it was a bad decision.
02:16:00.38 --> 02:16:02.74 If I could go back and time, I'd do it in a different way.
02:16:02.74 --> 02:16:03.74 I didn't.
02:16:03.74 --> 02:16:06.18 That's the call that got made.
02:16:06.18 --> 02:16:10.74 Here's the adjustments we've made from what we learned and here's where we're going forward.
02:16:10.74 --> 02:16:13.10 Are you good with that?
02:16:13.10 --> 02:16:18.18 You have an omg just saying it was, I can't.
02:16:18.18 --> 02:16:20.10 Two be specific.
02:16:20.10 --> 02:16:21.78 Keep to concrete issues.
02:16:21.78 --> 02:16:23.26 Say what?
02:16:23.26 --> 02:16:26.82 Three limit the issue.
02:16:26.82 --> 02:16:31.22 Don't blame the brass hats or the men in general.
02:16:31.22 --> 02:16:32.22 Say who that's a good one.
02:16:32.22 --> 02:16:34.86 A lot of the time we were just like to blame them.
02:16:34.86 --> 02:16:38.46 They did it.
02:16:38.46 --> 02:16:45.14 To just practical solutions to problems don't arouse emotion without suggesting what to
02:16:45.14 --> 02:16:46.14 do about it.
02:16:46.14 --> 02:16:47.46 Say how?
02:16:47.46 --> 02:16:49.50 Five stick to facts.
02:16:49.50 --> 02:16:56.66 Don't swallow rumors, especially accidents by our rumors.
02:16:56.66 --> 02:17:03.42 Six criticized leaders or men for their acts and policies, not for their personalities.
02:17:03.42 --> 02:17:06.78 Seven put blame where it belongs.
02:17:06.78 --> 02:17:09.78 I don't find scapegoats.
02:17:09.78 --> 02:17:12.78 I was going to ask, why is it?
02:17:12.78 --> 02:17:20.22 I wonder why it's so like appealing for like a better term to blame other people.
02:17:20.22 --> 02:17:26.22 I mean I guess when you think about it it feels like if I don't have to blame myself
02:17:26.22 --> 02:17:27.22 that's a safety thing.
02:17:27.22 --> 02:17:32.38 We'll start there and then sure someone will blame other things that are not people.
02:17:32.38 --> 02:17:39.02 Like I don't know the weather or whatever but it's almost like it seems more satisfying
02:17:39.02 --> 02:17:41.02 to blame other people.
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:43.26 I don't know maybe because they don't.
02:17:43.26 --> 02:17:46.10 It feels satisfying because it takes the blame off of you.
02:17:46.10 --> 02:17:54.22 Even more than blaming the weather whether it's almost like it's more satisfying because
02:17:54.22 --> 02:17:59.22 if I can blame someone else because someone else has the capability of actively trying
02:17:59.22 --> 02:18:01.66 to get in the way of my success.
02:18:01.66 --> 02:18:03.66 It's almost like this is what it feels like.
02:18:03.66 --> 02:18:05.66 I think I'm just wondering.
02:18:05.66 --> 02:18:10.22 I don't feel good about blaming anything or anybody or anyone.
02:18:10.22 --> 02:18:16.78 Yeah because you're really in touch with that part of things.
02:18:16.78 --> 02:18:20.10 I'm just saying by nature because it has to be a natural thing.
02:18:20.10 --> 02:18:23.58 It has to be like a natural reaction to something I would think.
02:18:23.58 --> 02:18:25.22 In different people have it worth another thing.
02:18:25.22 --> 02:18:30.06 I would say that's a reaction that's not too natural and it's a reaction that you have
02:18:30.06 --> 02:18:37.54 to nourish and raise correctly in yourself because when a little kid spells the
02:18:37.54 --> 02:18:38.54 milk.
02:18:38.54 --> 02:18:42.74 When you walk into the kitchen and your daughter sitting there in the milk is spilled
02:18:42.74 --> 02:18:46.46 over she says, you say what happened?
02:18:46.46 --> 02:18:49.14 She says the milk spilled.
02:18:49.14 --> 02:18:51.30 She's blaming the milk and anandement object.
02:18:51.30 --> 02:18:52.30 Right.
02:18:52.30 --> 02:18:53.58 Already and she's four years old.
02:18:53.58 --> 02:18:54.58 Five years old.
02:18:54.58 --> 02:18:56.98 Right.
02:18:56.98 --> 02:18:57.98 I'm the same way.
02:18:57.98 --> 02:18:59.98 Everyone starts off that way.
02:18:59.98 --> 02:19:03.70 Blow to our ego to take the blame for things.
02:19:03.70 --> 02:19:05.50 We don't like to do it.
02:19:05.50 --> 02:19:10.22 So it's not like it's something you have to mature into.
02:19:10.22 --> 02:19:14.78 It's something you have to figure out over time and the more you figure it out, the better
02:19:14.78 --> 02:19:16.06 off you're going to be.
02:19:16.06 --> 02:19:18.62 I was talking with Dave Burke about this.
02:19:18.62 --> 02:19:21.22 Good deal, Dave.
02:19:21.22 --> 02:19:29.06 He was really fired up one day and the fire was coming.
02:19:29.06 --> 02:19:33.30 And I forget even what you know how we got on this topic.
02:19:33.30 --> 02:19:38.50 Actually, I do think we were talking about a client that we have at echelon front and he
02:19:38.50 --> 02:19:45.26 was trying to explain to them that everything like trying to explain to the boss, the
02:19:45.26 --> 02:19:52.42 CEO, everything, everything is your fault, everything.
02:19:52.42 --> 02:19:55.06 And I got to, no, no, I get it.
02:19:55.06 --> 02:19:57.06 But yeah.
02:19:57.06 --> 02:19:58.46 No, no, no, no.
02:19:58.46 --> 02:19:59.46 I'm all about extreme ownership.
02:19:59.46 --> 02:20:00.46 I get it, man.
02:20:00.46 --> 02:20:02.46 That's a great book.
02:20:02.46 --> 02:20:07.86 And I'm definitely taking ownership of what's going on here.
02:20:07.86 --> 02:20:16.14 But there's always a butt, but the market, but the guys that are hired, but the person
02:20:16.14 --> 02:20:22.42 that I partnered with, but the person I bought the company from, but it goes on and on.
02:20:22.42 --> 02:20:26.42 But the real estate that we least, it just goes on and on.
02:20:26.42 --> 02:20:27.42 And guess what?
02:20:27.42 --> 02:20:28.42 None of those are your problem.
02:20:28.42 --> 02:20:29.42 None of those are your fault.
02:20:29.42 --> 02:20:30.42 Guess what?
02:20:30.42 --> 02:20:31.54 You're never going to fix any of them.
02:20:31.54 --> 02:20:37.42 So the idea that this stuff is 100% your fault.
02:20:37.42 --> 02:20:39.34 100% your fault.
02:20:39.34 --> 02:20:41.50 That's going on in your team.
02:20:41.50 --> 02:20:45.42 That's that it's hard to get that through your brain.
02:20:45.42 --> 02:20:46.42 Anyone's brain.
02:20:46.42 --> 02:20:48.42 Yeah, it's weird.
02:20:48.42 --> 02:20:52.86 You like you ever, you know, when you're a kid or something, or whether you witnessed someone
02:20:52.86 --> 02:20:55.74 else do this or you do it where it's like, let's say you lost something.
02:20:55.74 --> 02:20:56.74 Right.
02:20:56.74 --> 02:20:57.74 That's the first reaction.
02:20:57.74 --> 02:20:58.74 Who took my, whatever.
02:20:58.74 --> 02:20:59.74 What do you mean?
02:20:59.74 --> 02:21:00.74 Who took it?
02:21:00.74 --> 02:21:01.74 That's a seal curse.
02:21:01.74 --> 02:21:06.58 So the seal curse, if you lose something, as soon as you say, hey, you took my, or hey, somebody
02:21:06.58 --> 02:21:09.70 stole my, as soon as you, those words come out of your mouth, you're going to, it's going
02:21:09.70 --> 02:21:10.70 to appear in front of you.
02:21:10.70 --> 02:21:14.38 You can actually do it like to find something to evolve.
02:21:14.38 --> 02:21:15.38 Excuse me, I'm so funny.
02:21:15.38 --> 02:21:16.38 I'm going to do this.
02:21:16.38 --> 02:21:17.38 I'm going to find an immediate, yeah.
02:21:17.38 --> 02:21:21.54 That's probably my earliest memory in the seal teams of, don't blame people.
02:21:21.54 --> 02:21:22.54 Is that right there?
02:21:22.54 --> 02:21:26.78 Because if you, you can't find your, second mark life jacket, whatever.
02:21:26.78 --> 02:21:27.78 Yeah.
02:21:27.78 --> 02:21:29.30 So when you took my second mark, oh, there it is.
02:21:29.30 --> 02:21:30.30 It's a willing stencil.
02:21:30.30 --> 02:21:32.90 The JKO stencils on that one over there.
02:21:32.90 --> 02:21:34.30 It was underneath another one.
02:21:34.30 --> 02:21:35.30 Yeah.
02:21:35.30 --> 02:21:36.86 But yes, that's something that we all do.
02:21:36.86 --> 02:21:39.14 But it's like a natural thing to think, be good.
02:21:39.14 --> 02:21:40.14 Okay.
02:21:40.14 --> 02:21:43.50 So I have these, these slippers at home.
02:21:43.50 --> 02:21:44.86 Do you mean flip flops?
02:21:44.86 --> 02:21:45.86 No.
02:21:45.86 --> 02:21:46.86 That's the thing.
02:21:46.86 --> 02:21:47.86 They're, they're nice.
02:21:47.86 --> 02:21:48.86 Because no way we call flip flops.
02:21:48.86 --> 02:21:49.86 Flip flops.
02:21:49.86 --> 02:21:50.86 Yes, exactly.
02:21:50.86 --> 02:21:51.86 But these are slippers.
02:21:51.86 --> 02:21:55.86 Just flying in and out of like when you're walking and whatever.
02:21:55.86 --> 02:22:01.62 And so flip flops, like if you, let's say you're wearing flip flops or fangs, flip flops, right?
02:22:01.62 --> 02:22:03.86 That's flip flops or.
02:22:03.86 --> 02:22:04.86 So they're not that.
02:22:04.86 --> 02:22:08.86 Because if you're wearing socks, which I have been recently, because it's kind of chilly.
02:22:08.86 --> 02:22:11.46 But it's all wear socks.
02:22:11.46 --> 02:22:14.66 So you can't just slide in and out of flip flops with socks on.
02:22:14.66 --> 02:22:17.62 Not that good, you know, if I'm going to take out the trash or something like this.
02:22:17.62 --> 02:22:21.98 So anyway, I have these slippers real comfortable to their like just regular Nike, like slippers,
02:22:21.98 --> 02:22:23.14 whatever.
02:22:23.14 --> 02:22:30.86 So when I can't find them for a moment, you know, there's literally like six or seven
02:22:30.86 --> 02:22:32.86 places that are far away from each other by the way.
02:22:32.86 --> 02:22:36.70 And my house is that six out of place that they could struggle as real.
02:22:36.70 --> 02:22:37.70 Yes, that goes.
02:22:37.70 --> 02:22:42.54 All of my slippers are located far distance inside my own house.
02:22:42.54 --> 02:22:43.54 Yeah.
02:22:43.54 --> 02:22:44.54 They're really far apart.
02:22:44.54 --> 02:22:45.54 Okay.
02:22:45.54 --> 02:22:48.30 I look in what place number one, they're not there.
02:22:48.30 --> 02:22:50.06 Place number two, they're not there.
02:22:50.06 --> 02:22:54.46 I automatically go my wife took wearing my slippers.
02:22:54.46 --> 02:22:57.54 For someone grabbed my slippers, you know, that's like the thing.
02:22:57.54 --> 02:23:02.02 Even more so than the, you know, the four, five other places that I could easily, you know,
02:23:02.02 --> 02:23:04.42 so I think that's why I think it's a natural thing.
02:23:04.42 --> 02:23:05.42 It is a natural thing.
02:23:05.42 --> 02:23:06.78 Yes, you are correct.
02:23:06.78 --> 02:23:11.10 I've been saying that for the whole time, you and I have been doing this podcast.
02:23:11.10 --> 02:23:13.42 It's a natural thing to blame someone else.
02:23:13.42 --> 02:23:14.42 Yeah.
02:23:14.42 --> 02:23:18.14 This idea of extreme ownership of actually taking ownership of problems that you have
02:23:18.14 --> 02:23:19.14 is very important.
02:23:19.14 --> 02:23:20.14 Yeah.
02:23:20.14 --> 02:23:21.90 And it's hard to enact.
02:23:21.90 --> 02:23:23.30 It's not, it's not comfortable.
02:23:23.30 --> 02:23:24.30 Yeah.
02:23:24.30 --> 02:23:25.30 There's no one.
02:23:25.30 --> 02:23:29.02 And even when people eat the book and they listen to everybody podcast and they talk about
02:23:29.02 --> 02:23:35.94 it with their troops, even then it's very easy to slide into an excuse and you blame
02:23:35.94 --> 02:23:37.86 someone or something else.
02:23:37.86 --> 02:23:41.94 And the problem with those excuses are they don't ever solve themselves.
02:23:41.94 --> 02:23:43.54 They don't fix themselves.
02:23:43.54 --> 02:23:45.34 You can control you.
02:23:45.34 --> 02:23:48.54 So take control over everything.
02:23:48.54 --> 02:23:55.22 Take ownership of everything so that you can make them the way that they should be.
02:23:55.22 --> 02:23:56.70 What's the dichotomy in this?
02:23:56.70 --> 02:23:57.98 That's why we wrote dichotomy leadership.
02:23:57.98 --> 02:24:00.94 Some people took that and said, okay, well, I'm just going to do everything myself.
02:24:00.94 --> 02:24:01.94 Yeah.
02:24:01.94 --> 02:24:04.38 I'm just, oh, John, I was going to hold everything.
02:24:04.38 --> 02:24:08.54 So now I'm going to, you know what, echo, send me a script for the video you're making
02:24:08.54 --> 02:24:09.54 right now.
02:24:09.54 --> 02:24:10.54 I want to review it.
02:24:10.54 --> 02:24:11.54 Right?
02:24:11.54 --> 02:24:14.54 I'm going to call when you like draw the pictures send me up.
02:24:14.54 --> 02:24:17.66 Storyboard for your next video.
02:24:17.66 --> 02:24:18.66 Ownership.
02:24:18.66 --> 02:24:20.30 No, that's not what I'm talking about.
02:24:20.30 --> 02:24:21.90 There's a balance.
02:24:21.90 --> 02:24:22.90 Yeah.
02:24:22.90 --> 02:24:23.90 So there's a question.
02:24:23.90 --> 02:24:24.90 Keep it.
02:24:24.90 --> 02:24:27.18 You have to keep it balance.
02:24:27.18 --> 02:24:29.70 So this question, right now, not really care about the answer.
02:24:29.70 --> 02:24:33.98 So is it easier to blame another person or just something else?
02:24:33.98 --> 02:24:34.98 Like something else.
02:24:34.98 --> 02:24:35.98 Something else.
02:24:35.98 --> 02:24:36.98 Okay, this is a original point.
02:24:36.98 --> 02:24:37.98 Yeah.
02:24:37.98 --> 02:24:38.98 And to me, it's the point is no matter.
02:24:38.98 --> 02:24:41.86 I feel equally horrible.
02:24:41.86 --> 02:24:44.78 I actually feel more horrible blaming another person.
02:24:44.78 --> 02:24:46.18 You seem to feel better about that.
02:24:46.18 --> 02:24:47.42 No, no, no, no, no, no.
02:24:47.42 --> 02:24:48.42 I feel worse.
02:24:48.42 --> 02:24:49.42 I feel bad.
02:24:49.42 --> 02:24:50.42 I'm breath.
02:24:50.42 --> 02:24:51.42 I'm with you.
02:24:51.42 --> 02:24:52.42 Okay.
02:24:52.42 --> 02:24:53.42 Whether you believe me or not, I'm breath.
02:24:53.42 --> 02:24:56.58 Blaming like something other than yourself, it does feel really, really whack.
02:24:56.58 --> 02:24:57.58 Yes.
02:24:57.58 --> 02:24:58.58 Really whack.
02:24:58.58 --> 02:24:59.98 But and that's kind of the rule now.
02:24:59.98 --> 02:25:06.10 I think after like four to six months of like dealing with you and this stuff, it's
02:25:06.10 --> 02:25:07.74 like you became like a rule.
02:25:07.74 --> 02:25:10.14 Is it consciously or whatever?
02:25:10.14 --> 02:25:12.58 So is it identify another people do it too?
02:25:12.58 --> 02:25:13.58 Yes, fully.
02:25:13.58 --> 02:25:14.58 Well, I was.
02:25:14.58 --> 02:25:15.58 Yeah.
02:25:15.58 --> 02:25:20.06 And you feel it in yourself even if you have the thought, like you feel it.
02:25:20.06 --> 02:25:25.98 But so I was thinking wondering, and I guess it doesn't matter, right?
02:25:25.98 --> 02:25:30.42 Because the rule is the rule, but is it easier to blame a person?
02:25:30.42 --> 02:25:31.42 Because it's more comforting.
02:25:31.42 --> 02:25:36.06 It's easier to blame a thing because then it's free.
02:25:36.06 --> 02:25:37.70 There's no guilt involved.
02:25:37.70 --> 02:25:38.70 Whether it was bad.
02:25:38.70 --> 02:25:39.70 That's why we failed.
02:25:39.70 --> 02:25:42.38 Well, the weather doesn't get mad at you because even when I'm like, hey, I go screwed
02:25:42.38 --> 02:25:43.38 up and drop the ball.
02:25:43.38 --> 02:25:44.38 That's why we failed.
02:25:44.38 --> 02:25:45.66 You are going to be mad at you.
02:25:45.66 --> 02:25:46.66 Yeah.
02:25:46.66 --> 02:25:47.66 The weather's not going to be like, hey, you got a flat tire.
02:25:47.66 --> 02:25:48.66 That's why I'm late.
02:25:48.66 --> 02:25:49.66 You should have left earlier.
02:25:49.66 --> 02:25:50.66 No, no, no, no, no.
02:25:50.66 --> 02:25:51.66 You're like, that's blaming.
02:25:51.66 --> 02:25:52.66 That's me taking ownership.
02:25:52.66 --> 02:25:53.66 Yeah.
02:25:53.66 --> 02:25:54.66 You know?
02:25:54.66 --> 02:25:55.66 But it's easy.
02:25:55.66 --> 02:25:57.42 But wouldn't it be more comforting to be like, hey, someone flat?
02:25:57.42 --> 02:26:00.26 Like let's say you walked out to your car and your tire was flat.
02:26:00.26 --> 02:26:05.02 It'd be more comforting if someone was actively trying to get in your way.
02:26:05.02 --> 02:26:06.66 Because it seems more like, okay.
02:26:06.66 --> 02:26:08.30 That's why I got defeated by the situation.
02:26:08.30 --> 02:26:09.30 I don't have a solution.
02:26:09.30 --> 02:26:10.30 I don't have an alternative.
02:26:10.30 --> 02:26:13.90 I think to me, say, hey, I walked out of the other's a nail in my thing.
02:26:13.90 --> 02:26:14.90 Yeah.
02:26:14.90 --> 02:26:15.90 You might take that one step.
02:26:15.90 --> 02:26:16.90 But somebody left a nail in my thing.
02:26:16.90 --> 02:26:17.90 Yeah, I assume saying no.
02:26:17.90 --> 02:26:20.14 I mean, I wouldn't, I don't think of it.
02:26:20.14 --> 02:26:21.14 Maybe I wouldn't know.
02:26:21.14 --> 02:26:22.14 I don't know.
02:26:22.14 --> 02:26:23.14 I don't know.
02:26:23.14 --> 02:26:24.14 Your sweat in this distinction.
02:26:24.14 --> 02:26:25.14 Don't blame other people or other things.
02:26:25.14 --> 02:26:26.14 That's what you do.
02:26:26.14 --> 02:26:27.38 You don't blame other people or other things.
02:26:27.38 --> 02:26:29.70 I'm reveling in the understanding.
02:26:29.70 --> 02:26:30.70 Don't revel in it.
02:26:30.70 --> 02:26:31.70 Just do.
02:26:31.70 --> 02:26:32.70 Just a whole action.
02:26:32.70 --> 02:26:33.70 Yeah, yeah.
02:26:33.70 --> 02:26:34.70 You're right.
02:26:34.70 --> 02:26:35.70 You're right.
02:26:35.70 --> 02:26:37.50 And you know what?
02:26:37.50 --> 02:26:40.58 We're going to wrap for today.
02:26:40.58 --> 02:26:46.30 We haven't even covered the major, the one of the main reasons why I'm covering this
02:26:46.30 --> 02:26:47.30 book.
02:26:47.30 --> 02:26:48.86 We haven't even got to yet.
02:26:48.86 --> 02:26:54.18 So if we haven't even gotten to it yet, I don't want to jump into it right now because
02:26:54.18 --> 02:26:55.66 it's good.
02:26:55.66 --> 02:26:59.22 This is a book where I'm highlighting entire pages.
02:26:59.22 --> 02:27:00.22 Entire pages.
02:27:00.22 --> 02:27:05.62 I'm just, so I want to have time to discuss this properly.
02:27:05.62 --> 02:27:10.50 We will not have time to discuss the rest of this properly today.
02:27:10.50 --> 02:27:16.30 So one thing we do have hopefully time to discuss properly.
02:27:16.30 --> 02:27:21.62 It's questionable because I know someone said the other day, I said on the podcast,
02:27:21.62 --> 02:27:24.78 A, all we need to do is just wrap this up.
02:27:24.78 --> 02:27:27.30 And they looked at their podcast, the player.
02:27:27.30 --> 02:27:31.10 And there was 47 minutes left.
02:27:31.10 --> 02:27:32.82 So it took you 47 minutes.
02:27:32.82 --> 02:27:33.82 I'm blaming you.
02:27:33.82 --> 02:27:34.82 I know.
02:27:34.82 --> 02:27:35.82 I know.
02:27:35.82 --> 02:27:44.22 I know I am at least partially guilty for lengthy sections of the podcast because what
02:27:44.22 --> 02:27:48.58 I can't refrain from doing is making a little comment that spurns you to talk about Hawaii
02:27:48.58 --> 02:27:49.58 5O.
02:27:49.58 --> 02:27:50.58 Sure.
02:27:50.58 --> 02:27:51.58 Other important topics.
02:27:51.58 --> 02:28:03.78 So we'll continue with this book next week right now if you, if you want to compete.
02:28:03.78 --> 02:28:04.78 Sure.
02:28:04.78 --> 02:28:13.06 In life, look, I'm not saying you got to look at life as one big competition, win or lose.
02:28:13.06 --> 02:28:16.46 But I'm saying you should at least consider that that's kind of happening whether you
02:28:16.46 --> 02:28:18.54 want it to be happening or not.
02:28:18.54 --> 02:28:32.42 In that view, you want to get on a path of victory, a path of discipline, a path of winning.
02:28:32.42 --> 02:28:36.66 And I know you have some things that might help us in there.
02:28:36.66 --> 02:28:37.66 Yes, sir.
02:28:37.66 --> 02:28:38.66 Echo Charles.
02:28:38.66 --> 02:28:42.54 So it is one of these, so if you like the way you live your life, right?
02:28:42.54 --> 02:28:46.30 You're, it's like you're preparing for a battle metaphorically or whatever.
02:28:46.30 --> 02:28:47.30 Right.
02:28:47.30 --> 02:28:53.90 So sure, you're not competing with me or with whatever in every single little thing.
02:28:53.90 --> 02:28:54.90 Right.
02:28:54.90 --> 02:28:57.42 In fact, you're a big part of what you do is collaborate with me.
02:28:57.42 --> 02:28:58.42 True.
02:28:58.42 --> 02:28:59.42 Good.
02:28:59.42 --> 02:29:02.86 But it's a weekend win, so we can win exactly right.
02:29:02.86 --> 02:29:07.70 And in addition to that, if you wake up just one moment and you're in the company,
02:29:07.70 --> 02:29:15.74 the heated competition of whatever, you're going to be more prepared to win.
02:29:15.74 --> 02:29:16.74 Yes, sir.
02:29:16.74 --> 02:29:22.10 If you put yourself in stressful situations, you'll be more prepared when the real
02:29:22.10 --> 02:29:23.10 stress comes.
02:29:23.10 --> 02:29:24.10 Oh, yeah.
02:29:24.10 --> 02:29:25.10 Yeah.
02:29:25.10 --> 02:29:28.10 So let's say, you get to, for example, right?
02:29:28.10 --> 02:29:30.26 Stress situation, you can put yourself right into.
02:29:30.26 --> 02:29:31.26 Yeah.
02:29:31.26 --> 02:29:33.10 So let's daily base and think about this too.
02:29:33.10 --> 02:29:36.90 And where, you know, the whole collaboration competition balance goes,
02:29:36.90 --> 02:29:42.34 give me and you, we're competing in you too with each other when we train, right?
02:29:42.34 --> 02:29:48.86 Or end we're competing with ourselves because you're using me to just get better in general.
02:29:48.86 --> 02:29:52.78 So sure, there's a part of it that's like you're trying to defeat me, whatever.
02:29:52.78 --> 02:29:59.18 But the main part is you're trying to defeat, you know, the gut yourself, you know,
02:29:59.18 --> 02:30:00.74 a month ago or a day ago, whatever.
02:30:00.74 --> 02:30:02.66 Yes, trying to get better.
02:30:02.66 --> 02:30:07.30 And to do that, you have to collaborate with me who's going to provide that stress.
02:30:07.30 --> 02:30:08.30 Yeah.
02:30:08.30 --> 02:30:09.30 On you.
02:30:09.30 --> 02:30:13.30 See, so it's always like, I think there's always an overarching competition.
02:30:13.30 --> 02:30:15.34 That's what's called the life game.
02:30:15.34 --> 02:30:16.34 Yeah.
02:30:16.34 --> 02:30:17.34 Exactly.
02:30:17.34 --> 02:30:18.34 Yeah.
02:30:18.34 --> 02:30:20.34 With varying levels of, oh come on.
02:30:20.34 --> 02:30:22.06 Lots of little competitions along the way.
02:30:22.06 --> 02:30:23.06 Some of them are important.
02:30:23.06 --> 02:30:24.90 Some of them are some you've got a surrender.
02:30:24.90 --> 02:30:25.90 Yeah.
02:30:25.90 --> 02:30:29.50 Because it's going to propel you further in the long game.
02:30:29.50 --> 02:30:34.18 Some of them will feel like they should be a competition when they should be a collaboration.
02:30:34.18 --> 02:30:35.18 This should be.
02:30:35.18 --> 02:30:36.18 Okay.
02:30:36.18 --> 02:30:38.18 Anyway, back to you, too.
02:30:38.18 --> 02:30:39.18 Okay.
02:30:39.18 --> 02:30:40.18 Just to.
02:30:40.18 --> 02:30:41.18 We're doing, we're all doing, you did, too.
02:30:41.18 --> 02:30:43.42 If you're not, then just, you have to.
02:30:43.42 --> 02:30:44.42 Yes.
02:30:44.42 --> 02:30:48.26 Essentially, have to to know the path, probably.
02:30:48.26 --> 02:30:52.02 One thing that's good about you, too, is,
02:30:52.02 --> 02:30:57.66 it is also, I talked about combat and war being a revealer.
02:30:57.66 --> 02:30:59.06 Judges is revealing, too.
02:30:59.06 --> 02:31:01.98 It feels about things about yourself.
02:31:01.98 --> 02:31:03.42 It reveals things about human nature.
02:31:03.42 --> 02:31:05.98 It reveals things about your ego.
02:31:05.98 --> 02:31:07.86 It reveals things about your temper.
02:31:07.86 --> 02:31:09.66 It reveals a lot of things.
02:31:09.66 --> 02:31:11.26 And it reveals those things about other people.
02:31:11.26 --> 02:31:15.46 And you start to be able to sense and understand other people better because you see
02:31:15.46 --> 02:31:20.94 their reactions, you see how they respond, you see how they get through or don't get through
02:31:20.94 --> 02:31:22.82 trying situations.
02:31:22.82 --> 02:31:23.82 Yeah.
02:31:23.82 --> 02:31:24.82 It's really.
02:31:24.82 --> 02:31:26.54 And so there's some really good benefits.
02:31:26.54 --> 02:31:32.66 Beyond the fact that you will get a good workout, beyond the fact that you will truly
02:31:32.66 --> 02:31:39.30 learn to defend yourself in bad situations, you will also learn about life.
02:31:39.30 --> 02:31:40.30 Yes.
02:31:40.30 --> 02:31:41.70 You will learn about people.
02:31:41.70 --> 02:31:44.94 And you will learn about yourself.
02:31:44.94 --> 02:31:45.94 Yes, sir.
02:31:45.94 --> 02:31:49.70 So go down to your local Judges to Academy and tell me you want to train some of the
02:31:49.70 --> 02:31:51.70 Judges to that's kind of abstract.
02:31:51.70 --> 02:31:53.70 The way you said what's true.
02:31:53.70 --> 02:31:56.70 You know, you'll learn about life, not abstract, sorry.
02:31:56.70 --> 02:31:57.70 It's not a joke.
02:31:57.70 --> 02:31:58.70 No, no, no.
02:31:58.70 --> 02:31:59.70 Yeah, you're right.
02:31:59.70 --> 02:32:00.70 It's general though.
02:32:00.70 --> 02:32:01.70 Here's something specific.
02:32:01.70 --> 02:32:07.42 What if I told you, I've learned more about life and people and myself from
02:32:07.42 --> 02:32:11.70 Judges who that I have learned about self defense from Judges who.
02:32:11.70 --> 02:32:12.70 Yeah, in that whole state.
02:32:12.70 --> 02:32:14.70 I don't know what that would be like.
02:32:14.70 --> 02:32:15.70 But I'm not.
02:32:15.70 --> 02:32:16.70 I'm not.
02:32:16.70 --> 02:32:18.70 Because I don't think I've learned a lot.
02:32:18.70 --> 02:32:21.70 But I've learned so much about actually fighting.
02:32:21.70 --> 02:32:22.70 Yes.
02:32:22.70 --> 02:32:24.70 So that's kind of a what I just said.
02:32:24.70 --> 02:32:25.70 Not really.
02:32:25.70 --> 02:32:27.70 Could be for others though.
02:32:27.70 --> 02:32:28.70 There's a lot.
02:32:28.70 --> 02:32:29.70 Yeah, but I don't want to exaggerate.
02:32:29.70 --> 02:32:30.70 Well, he and lie.
02:32:30.70 --> 02:32:35.70 Well, here's why we said well, here's why I started and whether I mean, I think you started
02:32:35.70 --> 02:32:36.70 before this event.
02:32:36.70 --> 02:32:37.70 So, okay.
02:32:37.70 --> 02:32:41.70 So there's there is this family.
02:32:41.70 --> 02:32:44.70 They said, hey, we developed this martial art, you know, whatever.
02:32:44.70 --> 02:32:46.70 Is there a reason you're not saying the Gracie family?
02:32:46.70 --> 02:32:49.70 Yeah, well, it's going to develop it in a story.
02:32:49.70 --> 02:32:52.70 But yes, so the Gracie family, they developed their martial art.
02:32:52.70 --> 02:32:54.70 They were like, hey, this is our fighting style.
02:32:54.70 --> 02:32:55.70 A real fighting now.
02:32:55.70 --> 02:32:56.70 So let's this is what we're going to do.
02:32:56.70 --> 02:33:00.70 We're going to invite everyone from the all around the world with whatever fighting style
02:33:00.70 --> 02:33:03.70 no matter how big no matter how small the guy is, whatever fighting style.
02:33:03.70 --> 02:33:06.70 We're going to invite everybody to come come like fight.
02:33:06.70 --> 02:33:07.70 No time limit.
02:33:07.70 --> 02:33:08.70 No rules.
02:33:08.70 --> 02:33:09.70 No nothing.
02:33:09.70 --> 02:33:10.70 Everyone's going to fight.
02:33:10.70 --> 02:33:11.70 See who's fighting style.
02:33:11.70 --> 02:33:12.70 This is the best.
02:33:12.70 --> 02:33:12.70 Right?
02:33:12.70 --> 02:33:14.70 Sounds like an old school like movie or something.
02:33:14.70 --> 02:33:15.70 Yeah.
02:33:15.70 --> 02:33:16.70 That's true.
02:33:16.70 --> 02:33:17.70 Straight up happened.
02:33:17.70 --> 02:33:18.70 I mean, 1993.
02:33:18.70 --> 02:33:19.70 Right.
02:33:19.70 --> 02:33:20.70 Yeah.
02:33:20.70 --> 02:33:21.70 Colorado.
02:33:21.70 --> 02:33:24.70 So they come and.
02:33:24.70 --> 02:33:26.70 Hoist Gracie, who's 165 pounds.
02:33:26.70 --> 02:33:27.70 No, he's not 165 pounds.
02:33:27.70 --> 02:33:28.70 He's not 165 pounds.
02:33:28.70 --> 02:33:29.70 At the time, he's one five.
02:33:29.70 --> 02:33:31.70 I don't think so.
02:33:31.70 --> 02:33:34.70 I think he was like one, 62 or three actually.
02:33:34.70 --> 02:33:35.70 What's with hoist?
02:33:35.70 --> 02:33:36.70 Yeah.
02:33:36.70 --> 02:33:38.70 You see, one, two, three, one, two, four.
02:33:38.70 --> 02:33:40.70 If you rolled with hoist before, no.
02:33:40.70 --> 02:33:41.70 He's not small bro.
02:33:41.70 --> 02:33:42.70 Yeah, he's tall.
02:33:42.70 --> 02:33:43.70 He's tall.
02:33:43.70 --> 02:33:44.70 But he's thinner.
02:33:44.70 --> 02:33:45.70 He's thinner.
02:33:45.70 --> 02:33:47.70 But he's not like skinny.
02:33:47.70 --> 02:33:49.70 And he wasn't skinny back then.
02:33:49.70 --> 02:33:51.70 He must have waited at least 180.
02:33:51.70 --> 02:33:52.70 I'm going to give him 180.
02:33:52.70 --> 02:33:54.70 What we'll talk to hoist and get confirmation.
02:33:54.70 --> 02:33:55.70 We'll talk to some of our people.
02:33:55.70 --> 02:33:56.70 I think one, 60.
02:33:56.70 --> 02:33:57.70 Yeah.
02:33:57.70 --> 02:34:00.70 Anyway, if he was 160, I would have to check the scales.
02:34:00.70 --> 02:34:01.70 Yeah.
02:34:01.70 --> 02:34:02.70 Well, none of the last.
02:34:02.70 --> 02:34:06.70 Now, have you ever heard that they reasoned hoist was fighting and not Hickson is because
02:34:06.70 --> 02:34:11.70 Hoist was smaller and slender and looked less imposing.
02:34:11.70 --> 02:34:12.70 Yeah.
02:34:12.70 --> 02:34:13.70 Didn't Hickson.
02:34:13.70 --> 02:34:13.70 Yeah.
02:34:13.70 --> 02:34:14.70 Who did look imposing?
02:34:14.70 --> 02:34:15.70 Right.
02:34:15.70 --> 02:34:15.70 Yeah.
02:34:15.70 --> 02:34:18.70 And that was kind of an added look for imposing.
02:34:18.70 --> 02:34:19.70 Who looked more imposing?
02:34:19.70 --> 02:34:21.70 Hickson Gracie or Ken Shamrock.
02:34:21.70 --> 02:34:22.70 Ken Shamrock.
02:34:22.70 --> 02:34:24.70 Ken Shamrock looked real imposing.
02:34:24.70 --> 02:34:25.70 Oh, yeah.
02:34:25.70 --> 02:34:31.70 That's why it was so shocking when hoist had 160 pounds apparently tapped him out.
02:34:31.70 --> 02:34:32.70 Yeah.
02:34:32.70 --> 02:34:34.70 So the story, the facts go.
02:34:34.70 --> 02:34:35.70 This is what happened.
02:34:35.70 --> 02:34:37.70 You can watch them on the old videos.
02:34:37.70 --> 02:34:39.70 So they called it the ultimate fighting challenge.
02:34:39.70 --> 02:34:40.70 It's what they called it.
02:34:40.70 --> 02:34:41.70 The UFC.
02:34:41.70 --> 02:34:42.70 Sure.
02:34:42.70 --> 02:34:45.70 So hoist Gracie spriesingly beats up everyone.
02:34:45.70 --> 02:34:48.70 This wasn't the kind of like you have one fight in one night.
02:34:48.70 --> 02:34:49.70 No, no.
02:34:49.70 --> 02:34:50.70 This is like four fights in a row.
02:34:50.70 --> 02:34:51.70 If you win, you go on.
02:34:51.70 --> 02:34:53.70 You know, no time limit, by the way.
02:34:53.70 --> 02:34:55.70 Four contact fighting.
02:34:55.70 --> 02:34:56.70 Headbutt.
02:34:56.70 --> 02:34:58.70 Like whatever.
02:34:58.70 --> 02:34:59.70 Yeah.
02:34:59.70 --> 02:35:00.70 Kicking the groin, whatever.
02:35:00.70 --> 02:35:01.70 Anyway.
02:35:01.70 --> 02:35:05.70 Hoist Gracie beats everybody including Ken Shamrock who's like, well, he was like 220.
02:35:05.70 --> 02:35:06.70 He was a rich kid.
02:35:06.70 --> 02:35:07.70 Right.
02:35:07.70 --> 02:35:08.70 Shoot fighting wrestling.
02:35:08.70 --> 02:35:09.70 Like just a bad ask.
02:35:09.70 --> 02:35:10.70 I went for a fuck.
02:35:10.70 --> 02:35:11.70 He went for a fuck.
02:35:11.70 --> 02:35:13.70 When she's crazy, he's got on top.
02:35:13.70 --> 02:35:14.70 Yeah.
02:35:14.70 --> 02:35:15.70 And Hoist knew to defend it.
02:35:15.70 --> 02:35:16.70 That's even crazier.
02:35:16.70 --> 02:35:19.70 You know, go out and talk and choke them up.
02:35:19.70 --> 02:35:22.70 And then guys like who I don't think people talking about this guy.
02:35:22.70 --> 02:35:23.70 Pat Smith.
02:35:23.70 --> 02:35:24.70 Pat Smith is a beast.
02:35:24.70 --> 02:35:27.70 They're not cool kickboxing champions.
02:35:27.70 --> 02:35:28.70 Like 250 and no.
02:35:28.70 --> 02:35:30.70 That's what it said on the video.
02:35:30.70 --> 02:35:32.70 Um, bad just a tough bad ask.
02:35:32.70 --> 02:35:35.70 Because you was beating guys up real bad.
02:35:35.70 --> 02:35:38.70 In fact, he beat this ninja guy up on UFC 2.
02:35:38.70 --> 02:35:39.70 Yeah.
02:35:39.70 --> 02:35:41.70 That was like as a kid, watch out.
02:35:41.70 --> 02:35:43.70 I was like dang, that's like, this is brutal man.
02:35:43.70 --> 02:35:45.70 This is like scary brutal.
02:35:45.70 --> 02:35:47.70 And nowadays that's nothing.
02:35:47.70 --> 02:35:48.70 You know, you watch UFC now.
02:35:48.70 --> 02:35:50.70 But nonetheless it was brutal then.
02:35:50.70 --> 02:35:52.70 And Hoist Gracie beat him up.
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:53.70 And Hoist Gracie beat him up.
02:35:53.70 --> 02:35:56.70 He didn't do a submission hold on him.
02:35:56.70 --> 02:35:58.70 He just had him in Mount.
02:35:58.70 --> 02:35:59.70 Oh yeah.
02:35:59.70 --> 02:36:00.70 And just punching him down.
02:36:00.70 --> 02:36:01.70 He just tried to do this.
02:36:01.70 --> 02:36:01.70 You know.
02:36:01.70 --> 02:36:04.70 Anyway, so the point is, Hoist Gracie with Gracie Jiu Jitsu,
02:36:04.70 --> 02:36:05.70 which is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
02:36:05.70 --> 02:36:06.70 It's an exchange of hold.
02:36:06.70 --> 02:36:09.70 And beat up everyone.
02:36:09.70 --> 02:36:12.70 Proving that it's like the ultimate fighting style.
02:36:12.70 --> 02:36:13.70 Yeah.
02:36:13.70 --> 02:36:18.70 So that's why that's the number one reason I think most people go into Jitsu.
02:36:18.70 --> 02:36:20.70 That's definitely a good reason.
02:36:20.70 --> 02:36:22.70 I think well, back that I would say this.
02:36:22.70 --> 02:36:26.70 That's the number one reason in 1993, 1994, 1995.
02:36:26.70 --> 02:36:27.70 Why people want to Jiu Jitsu.
02:36:27.70 --> 02:36:33.70 I think Jiu Jitsu now is, I think Jiu Jitsu as a whole is more popular.
02:36:33.70 --> 02:36:34.70 You can get Jiu Jitsu from anywhere.
02:36:34.70 --> 02:36:37.70 I mean, at wrestling tournaments, there's all kinds of kids they're walking out.
02:36:37.70 --> 02:36:38.70 Jiu Jitsu, T-shirts on.
02:36:38.70 --> 02:36:42.70 They didn't want to even, they weren't even, they were, they're 12 years old.
02:36:42.70 --> 02:36:43.70 Yeah.
02:36:43.70 --> 02:36:45.70 And now they don't remember 1993.
02:36:45.70 --> 02:36:50.70 Think about something that happened whatever 20 years before you reborn.
02:36:50.70 --> 02:36:53.70 So I think it was something that happened in 1957.
02:36:53.70 --> 02:36:55.70 I can't think of one single thing.
02:36:55.70 --> 02:36:56.70 And that's what I'm saying.
02:36:56.70 --> 02:37:00.70 That's the first UFC happened to these kids 20 years before they were born.
02:37:00.70 --> 02:37:01.70 Yeah.
02:37:01.70 --> 02:37:02.70 They don't remember it.
02:37:02.70 --> 02:37:03.70 It's not even a thing.
02:37:03.70 --> 02:37:05.70 They do remember it's like, oh,
02:37:05.70 --> 02:37:09.70 if someone kid down the street knows how to fight, he choked me.
02:37:09.70 --> 02:37:10.70 I want to learn that.
02:37:10.70 --> 02:37:13.70 Yeah. Well, if they're watching ultimate fight night,
02:37:13.70 --> 02:37:16.70 last night or the other night or whatever,
02:37:16.70 --> 02:37:17.70 and they saw Crongrace.
02:37:17.70 --> 02:37:18.70 Yes.
02:37:18.70 --> 02:37:19.70 Show got the guy in UFC.
02:37:19.70 --> 02:37:20.70 Yes.
02:37:20.70 --> 02:37:21.70 In the first round.
02:37:21.70 --> 02:37:22.70 Yes.
02:37:22.70 --> 02:37:24.70 Someone's going to join Jiu Jitsu because that anyway, that is true.
02:37:24.70 --> 02:37:25.70 Yes.
02:37:25.70 --> 02:37:26.70 That was true.
02:37:26.70 --> 02:37:28.70 A beautiful display of Jiu Jitsu.
02:37:28.70 --> 02:37:30.70 Very crong-garic from Crongracey.
02:37:30.70 --> 02:37:31.70 Yeah.
02:37:31.70 --> 02:37:34.70 That always feels good because it's a reminder because it's easy.
02:37:34.70 --> 02:37:36.70 Like now because everyone knows Jiu Jitsu.
02:37:36.70 --> 02:37:38.70 You know, very levels or whatever.
02:37:38.70 --> 02:37:39.70 And you have to see.
02:37:39.70 --> 02:37:41.70 But when you get a guy who's like so good at Jiu Jitsu,
02:37:41.70 --> 02:37:44.70 every once in a while like he'll end him in Maya would do this too.
02:37:44.70 --> 02:37:48.70 They'd remind everyone like how powerful if you're just really good at Jiu Jitsu.
02:37:48.70 --> 02:37:51.70 And the other guy doesn't quite have those elements or whatever.
02:37:51.70 --> 02:37:53.70 You don't remind me of that.
02:37:53.70 --> 02:37:54.70 Dean Lister.
02:37:54.70 --> 02:37:56.70 He reminds me of that a lot.
02:37:56.70 --> 02:37:57.70 Yeah.
02:37:57.70 --> 02:37:58.70 For sure.
02:37:58.70 --> 02:38:00.70 Nonetheless, well, we're in Jiu Jitsu and we need to get what he do.
02:38:00.70 --> 02:38:02.70 We get origin.
02:38:02.70 --> 02:38:03.70 Gees.
02:38:03.70 --> 02:38:04.70 Made America.
02:38:04.70 --> 02:38:05.70 Yeah.

02:38:47.70 --> 02:38:48.70 From origin labs.
02:38:48.70 --> 02:38:50.70 That's kind of supplements.
02:38:50.70 --> 02:38:52.70 Kind of maintain your joints joint warfare.
02:38:52.70 --> 02:38:55.70 I sure are incurred.
02:38:55.70 --> 02:38:56.70 A hip.
02:38:56.70 --> 02:38:57.70 Injury.
02:38:57.70 --> 02:38:58.70 Mm-hmm.
02:38:58.70 --> 02:38:59.70 Yeah.
02:38:59.70 --> 02:39:00.70 The other day.
02:39:00.70 --> 02:39:02.70 It's really bad that night.
02:39:02.70 --> 02:39:04.70 So I don't overdo.
02:39:04.70 --> 02:39:06.70 Can you overdo some joint warfare?
02:39:06.70 --> 02:39:07.70 I'm not sure.
02:39:07.70 --> 02:39:08.70 I haven't tried.
02:39:08.70 --> 02:39:09.70 So I add just one pill.
02:39:09.70 --> 02:39:11.70 Usually I take, how much do you take a night?
02:39:11.70 --> 02:39:12.70 Three.
02:39:12.70 --> 02:39:13.70 Okay.
02:39:13.70 --> 02:39:14.70 I take three in the morning for it night.
02:39:14.70 --> 02:39:15.70 Okay.
02:39:15.70 --> 02:39:16.70 So I went two and two.
02:39:16.70 --> 02:39:17.70 Okay.
02:39:17.70 --> 02:39:19.70 And I'm like, I'm just going to do this or whatever.
02:39:19.70 --> 02:39:25.70 And it is the difference between night one of the injury and night two of the injury
02:39:25.70 --> 02:39:27.70 was surprising given how the injury felt.
02:39:27.70 --> 02:39:28.70 There you go.
02:39:28.70 --> 02:39:29.70 So this is it.
02:39:29.70 --> 02:39:30.70 Yes.
02:39:30.70 --> 02:39:31.70 So joint warfare.
02:39:31.70 --> 02:39:34.70 And these are the, now I think these are the most important kind of supplements.
02:39:34.70 --> 02:39:35.70 There is.
02:39:35.70 --> 02:39:36.70 I think I agree with you.
02:39:36.70 --> 02:39:41.70 Joint warfare, krill oil, discipline and discipline go.
02:39:41.70 --> 02:39:46.70 When you need a little bit of need to get in.
02:39:46.70 --> 02:39:49.70 You need to get up on step is what we call it in the teams.
02:39:49.70 --> 02:39:52.70 Well, and what that means is you're in a little zodiac boat.
02:39:52.70 --> 02:39:55.70 And the zodiac boat going across the water with a 55 horsepower engine.
02:39:55.70 --> 02:39:59.70 If you're out on the on the west coast on the east coast, they use a smaller engine on the west coast.
02:39:59.70 --> 02:40:05.70 You use a big 55 horsepower engine because you're out in the Pacific and the waves are freaking huge.
02:40:05.70 --> 02:40:12.70 But the reaches a point where kind of the, the boats like trying to push and then it gets on the,
02:40:12.70 --> 02:40:15.70 it's like in the water and then it gets kind of on the surface of the water.
02:40:15.70 --> 02:40:16.70 Mm-hmm.
02:40:16.70 --> 02:40:17.70 In all of a sudden it goes,
02:40:17.70 --> 02:40:18.70 mmm.
02:40:18.70 --> 02:40:20.70 And then you're going fast.
02:40:20.70 --> 02:40:21.70 You're on step.
02:40:21.70 --> 02:40:22.70 Yeah.
02:40:22.70 --> 02:40:23.70 Yeah.
02:40:23.70 --> 02:40:24.70 Getting on step.
02:40:24.70 --> 02:40:25.70 I don't know where that comes from.
02:40:25.70 --> 02:40:25.70 Huh.
02:40:25.70 --> 02:40:26.70 But in zodiac.
02:40:26.70 --> 02:40:29.70 So it's like the perfect zone where it gets the water.
02:40:29.70 --> 02:40:30.70 Catch the water.
02:40:30.70 --> 02:40:31.70 But no drag.
02:40:31.70 --> 02:40:32.70 Yes.
02:40:32.70 --> 02:40:34.70 That's the minimum amount of drag for the boat.
02:40:34.70 --> 02:40:39.70 And that's what I feel like when I take discipline go.
02:40:39.70 --> 02:40:40.70 Yeah.
02:40:40.70 --> 02:40:41.70 I've got to go.
02:40:41.70 --> 02:40:42.70 Let's say I'm going to meet with someone.
02:40:42.70 --> 02:40:46.70 I take like, you know, in a meeting, I'm going to be working with a company.
02:40:46.70 --> 02:40:47.70 Takes me to this one.
02:40:47.70 --> 02:40:50.70 Go get the mind firing correctly.
02:40:50.70 --> 02:40:51.70 That's that.
02:40:51.70 --> 02:40:52.70 Don't forget about Mok.
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:54.70 Additional protein.
02:40:54.70 --> 02:40:55.70 Additional protein.
02:40:55.70 --> 02:40:56.70 A delicious way.
02:40:56.70 --> 02:41:01.70 Well, you can call it additional protein or you can just call it dessert straight on.
02:41:01.70 --> 02:41:02.70 Yes.
02:41:02.70 --> 02:41:07.70 I had three scoops of Warrior Kid strawberry moke.
02:41:07.70 --> 02:41:13.70 And I was just sitting there drinking it and being happy about the world.
02:41:13.70 --> 02:41:14.70 Guilt, three guilt.
02:41:14.70 --> 02:41:19.70 But look, can you can you can beverage make you happy to be alive?
02:41:19.70 --> 02:41:19.70 Yes.
02:41:19.70 --> 02:41:28.70 Warrior Kid strawberry moke can make you happy to just be in the world and just be looking
02:41:28.70 --> 02:41:33.70 and be sipping on it and being and having a whole, a whole big cup.
02:41:33.70 --> 02:41:38.70 And you're just every sip is you're not even, you're not even rationing yourself
02:41:38.70 --> 02:41:39.70 at all.
02:41:39.70 --> 02:41:41.70 It's just a way sipping.
02:41:41.70 --> 02:41:47.70 Just free form just as much as you can put in your mouth like just beautiful strawberry
02:41:47.70 --> 02:41:48.70 moke.
02:41:48.70 --> 02:41:52.70 And I'm really getting crazy now where I'm, I'm really scatter brain.
02:41:52.70 --> 02:41:54.70 I'm like peanut butter moke.
02:41:54.70 --> 02:41:56.70 You can go right on the plate.
02:41:56.70 --> 02:41:57.70 Yeah.
02:41:57.70 --> 02:41:59.70 So anyways, that's that.
02:41:59.70 --> 02:42:00.70 Very good.
02:42:00.70 --> 02:42:03.70 All that stuff is at originmain.com.
02:42:03.70 --> 02:42:05.70 Also, jacquoise a store.
02:42:05.70 --> 02:42:07.70 It's called jacquoise store.
02:42:07.70 --> 02:42:11.70 And that's where you can be on the path for sure.
02:42:11.70 --> 02:42:13.70 Be on the path requirement.
02:42:13.70 --> 02:42:16.70 But if you want to represent while on the path.
02:42:16.70 --> 02:42:19.70 Go to jacquoise store.com, got some cool shirts on there.
02:42:19.70 --> 02:42:21.70 More rash guards.
02:42:21.70 --> 02:42:22.70 Yeah.
02:42:22.70 --> 02:42:25.70 More representative of the paths specifically.
02:42:25.70 --> 02:42:26.70 Some hoodies on there.
02:42:26.70 --> 02:42:27.70 Short hats.
02:42:27.70 --> 02:42:28.70 Short hats.
02:42:28.70 --> 02:42:29.70 Short hats.
02:42:29.70 --> 02:42:30.70 Specifically or flex fit.
02:42:30.70 --> 02:42:31.70 Whatever you like, bad.
02:42:31.70 --> 02:42:32.70 Both.
02:42:32.70 --> 02:42:33.70 However you want to represent.
02:42:33.70 --> 02:42:34.70 And here's the thing, look.
02:42:34.70 --> 02:42:37.70 I don't know if I'm going to put zip up hoodies on there.
02:42:37.70 --> 02:42:38.70 I don't know.
02:42:38.70 --> 02:42:39.70 I think so.
02:42:39.70 --> 02:42:41.70 That might not be your thing.
02:42:41.70 --> 02:42:43.70 They better be so thick.
02:42:43.70 --> 02:42:45.70 Maybe they'll be the whole world.
02:42:45.70 --> 02:42:49.70 That the whole world that the whole world stops and says,
02:42:49.70 --> 02:42:52.70 If I was in somewhere cold, I would wear that.
02:42:52.70 --> 02:42:53.70 Not the whole world will say.
02:42:53.70 --> 02:42:54.70 Because actually that makes sense.
02:42:54.70 --> 02:42:57.70 If you go ultra thick with the zip up,
02:42:57.70 --> 02:43:00.70 the reason you want zip up is because you got other clothes on.
02:43:00.70 --> 02:43:02.70 Some awkward taking it on and off over head.
02:43:02.70 --> 02:43:04.70 That's why you got the zip.
02:43:04.70 --> 02:43:07.70 It's a real heavy duty.
02:43:07.70 --> 02:43:08.70 I prefer the zip.
02:43:08.70 --> 02:43:09.70 Light or heavy.
02:43:09.70 --> 02:43:10.70 Yeah.
02:43:10.70 --> 02:43:12.70 But you prefer the pull over as you indicate.
02:43:12.70 --> 02:43:16.70 I don't want to play it.
02:43:16.70 --> 02:43:19.70 Like the pull over if we're talking about medium weight.
02:43:19.70 --> 02:43:21.70 But if we're going to ultra heavy weight,
02:43:21.70 --> 02:43:23.70 which no one has showed me ultra heavy weight.
02:43:23.70 --> 02:43:25.70 I want to see ultra heavy weight.
02:43:25.70 --> 02:43:28.70 I want something that actually is a hard to pick up kind of.
02:43:28.70 --> 02:43:31.70 Physically heavy.
02:43:31.70 --> 02:43:36.70 Well, I think nonetheless, I think I'm going to go with some zip up stuff for
02:43:36.70 --> 02:43:37.70 Jocco store.
02:43:37.70 --> 02:43:38.70 That's what I think.
02:43:38.70 --> 02:43:39.70 That's what I think.
02:43:39.70 --> 02:43:39.70 Okay.
02:43:39.70 --> 02:43:40.70 Brainstorm.
02:43:40.70 --> 02:43:46.70 As you brain storm that, let me see the samples and let me talk to the producers of the fabric.
02:43:46.70 --> 02:43:47.70 Okay.
02:43:47.70 --> 02:43:51.70 So I can make sure that it is the heaviest and most durable and warmest fabric.
02:43:51.70 --> 02:43:52.70 All right.
02:43:52.70 --> 02:43:53.70 That will.
02:43:53.70 --> 02:43:54.70 It's a promise.
02:43:54.70 --> 02:43:54.70 All right.
02:43:54.70 --> 02:43:55.70 There it is.
02:43:55.70 --> 02:43:57.70 It's at joccostore.com.
02:43:57.70 --> 02:43:58.70 Go in there.
02:43:58.70 --> 02:43:59.70 Do you like something?
02:43:59.70 --> 02:44:00.70 Get something.
02:44:00.70 --> 02:44:03.70 Good way to represent while you're on the path.
02:44:03.70 --> 02:44:05.70 Also, jocco like tea.
02:44:05.70 --> 02:44:09.70 If you were RIT drinker or not a tea drinker,
02:44:09.70 --> 02:44:13.70 still drink jocco white tea for various reasons.
02:44:13.70 --> 02:44:15.70 So I gave some of this to my neighbor.
02:44:15.70 --> 02:44:18.70 We're doing some things.
02:44:18.70 --> 02:44:21.70 You know, and she goes, oh my gosh.
02:44:21.70 --> 02:44:23.70 Yes, you know, like it was the one in the can.
02:44:23.70 --> 02:44:26.70 So my wife gave her three of them.
02:44:26.70 --> 02:44:29.70 And she's like, oh my gosh, thank you so much.
02:44:29.70 --> 02:44:30.70 This is so good.
02:44:30.70 --> 02:44:34.70 And it's so hard to find tea and a can that certified organic.
02:44:34.70 --> 02:44:35.70 Yeah.
02:44:35.70 --> 02:44:37.70 Like that was the front running thing for us.
02:44:37.70 --> 02:44:42.70 So I'm like looking at her like understanding that she has no idea that she can like dead live
02:44:42.70 --> 02:44:43.70 8,000 pounds.
02:44:43.70 --> 02:44:46.70 No, or you know, like all these other added benefits.
02:44:46.70 --> 02:44:52.70 But nonetheless, it really demonstrated how vast the benefits.
02:44:52.70 --> 02:44:53.70 Yeah.
02:44:53.70 --> 02:44:54.70 You know, and the people.
02:44:54.70 --> 02:44:55.70 Yeah.
02:44:55.70 --> 02:45:01.70 It's kind of a weird perspective to have on life when you when you rate certified organic
02:45:01.70 --> 02:45:05.70 over a guaranteed of deadlift of 8,000 pounds.
02:45:05.70 --> 02:45:08.70 And I know clinically, you know, it's crazy little bit straight.
02:45:08.70 --> 02:45:14.70 But nonetheless, after, you know, a little bit of thought I understand because you know, this is nice lady lives next door.
02:45:14.70 --> 02:45:16.70 And you know, I dug it either way.
02:45:16.70 --> 02:45:19.70 But one of the added benefits was brought to the surface.
02:45:19.70 --> 02:45:20.70 And I like this.
02:45:20.70 --> 02:45:25.70 Speaking of benefits, subscribe to the podcast, which we were going to stop saying until
02:45:25.70 --> 02:45:31.70 people noted that they didn't subscribe to the podcast until echo actually said it on podcast
02:45:31.70 --> 02:45:37.70 64 or no 163. And so it was like, I listened to 163 podcasts and hadn't subscribed.
02:45:37.70 --> 02:45:43.70 So subscribe to the podcast or echo will keep telling you to and don't forget about the war, your kid podcast,
02:45:43.70 --> 02:45:47.70 lagging, lagging on the war, your kid podcast.
02:45:47.70 --> 02:45:51.70 And I got told by young Alana, you know, Alana, sure.
02:45:51.70 --> 02:45:53.70 I got told by Alana's dad.
02:45:53.70 --> 02:45:59.70 He said he, she said, he said, she has memorized the first whatever it is.
02:45:59.70 --> 02:46:01.70 21 podcast.
02:46:01.70 --> 02:46:03.70 And I said, I looked at her and I said, I'm sorry.
02:46:03.70 --> 02:46:05.70 I'll make more and she said it's okay.
02:46:05.70 --> 02:46:07.70 But she didn't mean it.
02:46:07.70 --> 02:46:08.70 I don't think she meant it.
02:46:08.70 --> 02:46:10.70 And I think she was kind of like just being nice.
02:46:10.70 --> 02:46:11.70 It's a nice girl.
02:46:11.70 --> 02:46:14.70 I don't think she wanted to say, yeah, you should.
02:46:14.70 --> 02:46:15.70 Yeah.
02:46:15.70 --> 02:46:16.70 Some more podcasts.
02:46:16.70 --> 02:46:16.70 Yeah.
02:46:16.70 --> 02:46:18.70 The first 21 are getting worn out.
02:46:18.70 --> 02:46:20.70 War your kid podcast.

02:49:24.70 --> 02:49:26.70 Okay, so I made a mistake.
02:49:26.70 --> 02:49:28.70 So storm troopers are not clones.
02:49:28.70 --> 02:49:30.70 Storm troopers are like individual humans.
02:49:30.70 --> 02:49:32.70 Yeah, that they raised from kids or whatever.
02:49:32.70 --> 02:49:37.70 Clones are the clones from the Clone War.
02:49:37.70 --> 02:49:41.70 Who came from Bobo Fett or Jango Fett.
02:49:41.70 --> 02:49:42.70 One of them.
02:49:42.70 --> 02:49:44.70 Once again, bro, you're out of my league.

02:49:49.70 --> 02:49:51.70 Yeah, Charles jumped on you like you just.
02:49:51.70 --> 02:49:54.70 He was literally listening to it in my presence.
02:49:54.70 --> 02:49:55.70 I didn't know he was listening to it.
02:49:55.70 --> 02:49:56.70 He got to it.
02:49:56.70 --> 02:49:57.70 He paused.
02:49:57.70 --> 02:49:58.70 He's like, bro.
02:49:58.70 --> 02:50:00.70 And I'm like, you know, one of these kind of like you.
02:50:00.70 --> 02:50:01.70 I was like, who's like that kind?
02:50:01.70 --> 02:50:02.70 Yeah.
02:50:02.70 --> 02:50:03.70 And I was like, yeah.
02:50:03.70 --> 02:50:04.70 Yeah.
02:50:04.70 --> 02:50:05.70 And he's like, just storm troopers aren't.
02:50:05.70 --> 02:50:07.70 But, and he was, he was mad.
02:50:07.70 --> 02:50:09.70 Nonetheless, I still got the storm trooper kettlebell,
02:50:09.70 --> 02:50:11.70 which has nothing to do with any clones.
02:50:11.70 --> 02:50:12.70 It's just dope.
02:50:12.70 --> 02:50:14.70 And it's a kettlebell, which is good for, you know,
02:50:14.70 --> 02:50:16.70 you're working on and stuff.
02:50:16.70 --> 02:50:17.70 Anyway, I got it from on it.
02:50:17.70 --> 02:50:18.70 That's where they have the best.
02:50:18.70 --> 02:50:20.70 The best kettlebells, the best stuff.
02:50:20.70 --> 02:50:21.70 Go on there.
02:50:21.70 --> 02:50:22.70 Get something from there.
02:50:22.70 --> 02:50:23.70 It's really good stuff on it.
02:50:23.70 --> 02:50:24.70 I'll come slash.
02:50:24.70 --> 02:50:25.70 Jockel.
02:50:25.70 --> 02:50:26.70 We also have some books.
02:50:26.70 --> 02:50:28.70 What kind of books?
02:50:28.70 --> 02:50:31.70 Well, books for reading, I guess you might say.
02:50:31.70 --> 02:50:32.70 Mike in the dragons.
02:50:32.70 --> 02:50:34.70 How'd you like Mike in the dragons?
02:50:34.70 --> 02:50:35.70 I'll stand me.
02:50:35.70 --> 02:50:36.70 How often do you read it?
02:50:36.70 --> 02:50:38.70 So, I read.
02:50:38.70 --> 02:50:40.70 It's not on any kind of rotation,
02:50:40.70 --> 02:50:42.70 but I've read it three times.
02:50:42.70 --> 02:50:44.70 Two of the children, yeah.
02:50:44.70 --> 02:50:46.70 And did they support?
02:50:46.70 --> 02:50:47.70 Yeah.
02:50:47.70 --> 02:50:48.70 So, you know what's funny?
02:50:48.70 --> 02:50:50.70 They literally not only do they like reading it.
02:50:50.70 --> 02:50:51.70 They like watching the video,
02:50:51.70 --> 02:50:54.70 which, and I'm working on the whole book video.
02:50:54.70 --> 02:50:55.70 Yeah.
02:50:55.70 --> 02:50:57.70 So, when I work on it or whatever, they, you know,
02:50:57.70 --> 02:51:00.70 I'm not always uninterrupted.
02:51:00.70 --> 02:51:01.70 We'll say that.
02:51:01.70 --> 02:51:03.70 So, they'll see me working on that.
02:51:03.70 --> 02:51:05.70 Then I get constant interruption because they want to watch it.
02:51:05.70 --> 02:51:06.70 They want to see it.
02:51:06.70 --> 02:51:09.70 But I mean, I dig it because it is fun.
02:51:09.70 --> 02:51:10.70 Yeah.
02:51:10.70 --> 02:51:11.70 Really good book.
02:51:11.70 --> 02:51:15.70 Mike in the dragons, the little lessons for kids in that book.
02:51:15.70 --> 02:51:18.70 It's probably meant for a little bit younger age.
02:51:18.70 --> 02:51:20.70 It's than the other kids books have written.
02:51:20.70 --> 02:51:21.70 Way the warrior kid.
02:51:21.70 --> 02:51:24.70 And way the warrior kid, too, marks mission.
02:51:24.70 --> 02:51:26.70 And now we have way the warrior kid.
02:51:26.70 --> 02:51:27.70 Three.
02:51:27.70 --> 02:51:31.70 I'm trying to get that up for pre-order on Amazon.
02:51:31.70 --> 02:51:34.70 The subtitle is where there's a will.
02:51:34.70 --> 02:51:38.70 And some challenges presented to mark in this latest book.
02:51:38.70 --> 02:51:45.70 Thankfully, Uncle Jake is around to guide him and show him the path.
02:51:45.70 --> 02:51:50.70 Also, we got this when he goes for you to a field manual.
02:51:50.70 --> 02:51:55.70 It explains all the people that ask what you work out, what did you eat,
02:51:55.70 --> 02:51:57.70 what time did you sleep, all those questions?
02:51:57.70 --> 02:51:58.70 They're all in there.
02:51:58.70 --> 02:52:04.70 And then all the questions that are, how do you, how do you get out of bed?
02:52:04.70 --> 02:52:06.70 How do you, when you want to procrastinate?
02:52:06.70 --> 02:52:07.70 What do you do in your tired?
02:52:07.70 --> 02:52:08.70 What do you do in your angry?
02:52:08.70 --> 02:52:09.70 What do you do in your afraid?
02:52:09.70 --> 02:52:11.70 All those questions are put all those questions in one big book.
02:52:11.70 --> 02:52:12.70 It's called the Discipline.
02:52:12.70 --> 02:52:15.70 It was read a field manual.
02:52:15.70 --> 02:52:20.70 And it's a book that you can give to someone.
02:52:20.70 --> 02:52:24.70 And they will be happy.
02:52:24.70 --> 02:52:25.70 Sure.
02:52:25.70 --> 02:52:26.70 And they will not.
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:31.70 They will get more from the book.
02:52:31.70 --> 02:52:33.70 Then just a good read.
02:52:33.70 --> 02:52:37.70 They'll get a little shift in their perspective in life.
02:52:37.70 --> 02:52:46.70 And they might even hopefully get themselves head and down what we like to call the path.
02:52:46.70 --> 02:52:47.70 The path of discipline.
02:52:47.70 --> 02:52:53.70 I think you were right about that when you say that it's like the book that you sort of wish you had.
02:52:53.70 --> 02:52:54.70 Go first.
02:52:54.70 --> 02:53:01.70 Like when you, I would say maybe don't when I was like a teenager because I don't think I would have the capacity to write.
02:53:01.70 --> 02:53:09.70 Yeah, to accept, you know, this kind of, but like young adulthood, maybe like 23, 23ish.
02:53:09.70 --> 02:53:11.70 That would be like man.
02:53:11.70 --> 02:53:16.70 And what's crazy is I've got people that are 54.
02:53:16.70 --> 02:53:20.70 The one of the coolest things was I met a woman at the master.
02:53:20.70 --> 02:53:23.70 She was like 55 years old.
02:53:23.70 --> 02:53:24.70 And she was all excited.
02:53:24.70 --> 02:53:28.70 She saw me and she's like, hey, and I was like, hey, we were working out.
02:53:28.70 --> 02:53:29.70 And we got done with the workout.
02:53:29.70 --> 02:53:30.70 Oh, you started in the gym or something?
02:53:30.70 --> 02:53:32.70 No, no, no, no, in the, in the morning.
02:53:32.70 --> 02:53:33.70 Oh, my goodness.
02:53:33.70 --> 02:53:36.70 And she says to me, she says, you know why I'm here?
02:53:36.70 --> 02:53:40.70 And I was said, actually, I have no idea why you're here or how you got here.
02:53:40.70 --> 02:53:47.70 And she was in Costco or Walmart or Target and saw the discipline because freedom field manual.
02:53:47.70 --> 02:53:49.70 And she just looked at it and said, I'm buying this.
02:53:49.70 --> 02:53:50.70 I don't even know what it is.
02:53:50.70 --> 02:53:51.70 I'm buying it.
02:53:51.70 --> 02:53:54.70 God home, opened up Reddit.
02:53:54.70 --> 02:53:57.70 Next day gets up 430 in the morning starts working out.
02:53:57.70 --> 02:53:59.70 Like that's what we're talking about.
02:53:59.70 --> 02:54:00.70 Zero.
02:54:00.70 --> 02:54:06.70 This is a person that doesn't know anything about me about the podcast about any of the other books.
02:54:06.70 --> 02:54:10.70 Just that one book picks up and says, this, I'm just going to get this.
02:54:10.70 --> 02:54:12.70 And she was fired up.
02:54:12.70 --> 02:54:14.70 She, she, she lost weight.
02:54:14.70 --> 02:54:16.70 She's just crushing things.
02:54:16.70 --> 02:54:20.70 So that's a good book to get for yourself.
02:54:20.70 --> 02:54:22.70 It's a book that I read.
02:54:22.70 --> 02:54:24.70 It keeps me on the path.
02:54:24.70 --> 02:54:31.70 And if you want the audio version, it's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.
02:54:31.70 --> 02:54:33.70 There's obviously extreme ownership.
02:54:33.70 --> 02:54:37.70 First book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
02:54:37.70 --> 02:54:39.70 It's about leadership.
02:54:39.70 --> 02:54:43.70 It's about the leadership principles we learned in combat and how you can apply them.
02:54:43.70 --> 02:54:48.70 And then I talked about that kind of leadership today because sometimes we can take any principle.
02:54:48.70 --> 02:54:50.70 And we can go to foreign one direction or another.
02:54:50.70 --> 02:54:56.70 That can cause major derailment of your organization, your team, your life.
02:54:56.70 --> 02:54:58.70 So read the dichotomy of leadership.
02:54:58.70 --> 02:55:05.70 So you can know and understand and recognize the pitfalls of going too far in one direction or the other.
02:55:05.70 --> 02:55:09.70 On top of those two books, we got a little company called Ashilon Front.
02:55:09.70 --> 02:55:10.70 It's a leadership consultancy.
02:55:10.70 --> 02:55:15.70 And what we do is we solve your problems through leadership.
02:55:15.70 --> 02:55:17.70 That's what we do.
02:55:17.70 --> 02:55:19.70 Whatever problems you're having to organization,
02:55:19.70 --> 02:55:21.70 those problems are leadership problems.
02:55:21.70 --> 02:55:23.70 No matter what those problems are, they're leadership problems.
02:55:23.70 --> 02:55:25.70 That's what they are.
02:55:25.70 --> 02:55:30.70 And if you want to get those problems fixed, go to ashilonfront.com.
02:55:30.70 --> 02:55:33.70 And we'll be in touch.
02:55:33.70 --> 02:55:37.70 Also the master, which is a leadership conference 2019.
02:55:37.70 --> 02:55:39.70 We got May 23, 24th in Chicago.
02:55:39.70 --> 02:55:41.70 We got September 19th in 20th in Denver.
02:55:41.70 --> 02:55:44.70 We got December 4th in 5th in Sydney.
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:48.70 All of our shows we've ever done have sold out.
02:55:48.70 --> 02:55:51.70 These are going to sell out to if you want to come to them.
02:55:51.70 --> 02:55:56.70 Go to extremotorship.com and work it out.
02:55:56.70 --> 02:56:01.70 EF online just launched EF online in January.
02:56:01.70 --> 02:56:08.70 If you can't come to the master, if you are living in a situation where you can't come to the master,
02:56:08.70 --> 02:56:14.70 you can't afford the master, but you really want to get the information from the master.
02:56:14.70 --> 02:56:16.70 Awesome.
02:56:16.70 --> 02:56:20.70 You liked extreme ownership and you want to get more out of it.
02:56:20.70 --> 02:56:24.70 Awesome. You like listening to podcast and you want to dig a little deeper.
02:56:24.70 --> 02:56:28.70 Awesome. All those situations is why we made something called EF online.
02:56:28.70 --> 02:56:30.70 Had a company.
02:56:30.70 --> 02:56:34.70 18 months ago, guys said, hey, I want you to train everyone in my organization.
02:56:34.70 --> 02:56:36.70 I said, yeah, do it. No problem.
02:56:36.70 --> 02:56:38.70 And then I was like, wait a second.
02:56:38.70 --> 02:56:40.70 How many people do you have?
02:56:40.70 --> 02:56:42.70 87,000 globally.
02:56:42.70 --> 02:56:45.70 Guess what? I was like, okay, let me.
02:56:45.70 --> 02:56:47.70 Let me get back to you.
02:56:47.70 --> 02:56:51.70 Because I humanly physically could not do that.
02:56:51.70 --> 02:56:54.70 So I had to think about how we're going to scale this thing.
02:56:54.70 --> 02:56:57.70 We talked to Lay from like, let's go.
02:56:57.70 --> 02:56:58.70 Let's go digital.
02:56:58.70 --> 02:57:04.70 And it's a little scary because in the Navy, we did like the digital training.
02:57:04.70 --> 02:57:08.70 Sometimes online HR type training and it was a lame.
02:57:08.70 --> 02:57:10.70 And so I was nervous about it.
02:57:10.70 --> 02:57:14.70 But once we saw the new technology, which exists, which is awesome,
02:57:14.70 --> 02:57:15.70 that's what we did.
02:57:15.70 --> 02:57:17.70 So we spent the last year putting it together.
02:57:17.70 --> 02:57:18.70 It's interactive.
02:57:18.70 --> 02:57:19.70 You do role plays.
02:57:19.70 --> 02:57:21.70 You put yourself in combat situations.
02:57:21.70 --> 02:57:23.70 As a leader, you put yourself in business situations.
02:57:23.70 --> 02:57:25.70 As a leader, you got frequently asked questions.
02:57:25.70 --> 02:57:30.70 You got all kinds of choose your own adventure scenarios that are full.
02:57:30.70 --> 02:57:37.70 And you get the briefings and explanations and details around the principles of combat leadership.
02:57:37.70 --> 02:57:38.70 It's all in there.
02:57:38.70 --> 02:57:40.70 So if you want to check that out,
02:57:40.70 --> 02:57:45.70 it's at EF Online.com, EF Online.com,

02:58:05.70 --> 02:58:08.70 in the books and on this podcast.

02:59:05.70 --> 02:59:13.70 thanks for everything that you do to keep our safety and security intact.
02:59:13.70 --> 02:59:19.70 And to everyone else, that's out there listening.
02:59:19.70 --> 02:59:22.70 Remember what this book said.
02:59:22.70 --> 02:59:27.70 And that's remember that real defeats other than death itself,
02:59:27.70 --> 02:59:31.70 our psychological nature.
02:59:31.70 --> 02:59:36.70 And that's the important contest in life itself,
02:59:36.70 --> 02:59:38.70 our psychological nature.
02:59:38.70 --> 02:59:40.70 So know who you're dealing with.
02:59:40.70 --> 02:59:42.70 Know who you can count on.
02:59:42.70 --> 02:59:45.70 Know your enemy and what his strength and weaknesses are.
02:59:45.70 --> 02:59:49.70 And most important, know yourself.
02:59:49.70 --> 02:59:51.70 Know your own nature.
02:59:51.70 --> 02:59:58.70 So you can avoid the pitfalls that we are all susceptible to.
02:59:58.70 --> 03:00:05.70 Know yourself so you can stand up in any situation and keep getting after it.
03:00:05.70 --> 03:00:08.70 No matter what.
03:00:08.70 --> 03:00:33.70 So until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
