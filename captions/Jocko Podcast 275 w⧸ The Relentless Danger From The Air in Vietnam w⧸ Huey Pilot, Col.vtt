00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.74
This is Jockel podcast number 275.

2
00:00:02.74 --> 00:00:05.58
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:05.58 --> 00:00:06.58
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:06.58 --> 00:00:07.58
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.58 --> 00:00:14.48
I have thought about writing this for the past 48 years.

6
00:00:14.98 --> 00:00:19.72
As I wrote, I felt it was important to relate to those great soldiers

7
00:00:19.72 --> 00:00:22.98
that made this such a great company.

8
00:00:22.98 --> 00:00:28.98
We all have a journey in life with many crossroads, curves and offshoots.

9
00:00:29.98 --> 00:00:35.54
The synergistic effect created by individual journeys coming together at this point in time

10
00:00:35.54 --> 00:00:40.78
at this location created an organization that truly stood above the rest.

11
00:00:42.38 --> 00:00:47.18
The quality of an organization, abs and flows with the quality of the leadership

12
00:00:47.42 --> 00:00:52.50
and the dedication, personalities and expertise of the individuals present

13
00:00:52.50 --> 00:00:53.80
at a particular time.

14
00:00:55.10 --> 00:01:02.30
During this time period, I witnessed the synergism of the unit only increase further

15
00:01:02.30 --> 00:01:03.90
with each passing month.

16
00:01:06.30 --> 00:01:10.90
This story is important so that people know who the helicopter crews were

17
00:01:10.90 --> 00:01:13.50
and what they were asked to do and did.

18
00:01:15.10 --> 00:01:21.80
In 1964 and 65, the Army ramped up the Warren Officer candidate program

19
00:01:21.80 --> 00:01:25.30
to meet the expanding need for helicopter pilots and Vietnam.

20
00:01:26.90 --> 00:01:34.90
Between 1965 and 1971, 44,000 Warren Officer cadets were awarded flight wings.

21
00:01:36.30 --> 00:01:40.10
Most were high school graduates and some had some college.

22
00:01:41.30 --> 00:01:47.50
The average age of pilots, crew chiefs and doorgunners was 20 years old.

23
00:01:47.50 --> 00:01:57.000
Badly needed, they were trained quickly and given enormous responsibility to maintain a very complex piece of equipment.

24
00:01:58.50 --> 00:02:02.000
Our aircraft were not as sophisticated as the machines today,

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but the UH-1D and the UH-1H models were exceptional.

26
00:02:08.50 --> 00:02:13.50
For giving war courses, without which this war could not have been waged.

27
00:02:13.50 --> 00:02:28.50
Of the 5,000 UH-1 helicopters that went to Vietnam starting in 1962, over 3,300 were destroyed in combat.

28
00:02:30.50 --> 00:02:36.50
This undeclared war also could not have been waged without the young men that supported, maintained,

29
00:02:36.50 --> 00:02:43.000
and crewed these aircraft.

30
00:02:45.50 --> 00:02:54.50
Average age of pilots and crews 20 years old, 3,300 out of 5,000 helicopters lost in combat.

31
00:02:55.50 --> 00:03:01.50
That is a little excerpt from the introduction of a book called Undoanted Valor,

32
00:03:01.50 --> 00:03:08.50
an assault helicopter unit in Vietnam 1969 to 1970.

33
00:03:09.50 --> 00:03:16.50
The book was written by Colonel Matt Jackson, who served as a UH-1,

34
00:03:17.50 --> 00:03:23.50
also known as the Huey pilot in the 227th assault helicopter battalion in Vietnam.

35
00:03:23.50 --> 00:03:30.50
And he also continued on in the Army after Vietnam becoming an infantry officer,

36
00:03:31.50 --> 00:03:34.50
and eventually commanding a battalion during the first Gulf War,

37
00:03:35.50 --> 00:03:41.50
and conducting the largest aerosolte in history with the 101st Airborne Division.

38
00:03:44.50 --> 00:03:50.50
And it is an honor to have Colonel Matt Jackson here with us tonight to discuss his experiences

39
00:03:50.50 --> 00:03:54.50
and share his lessons learned. Colonel.

40
00:03:55.50 --> 00:03:56.50
Thank you, Colonel.

41
00:03:57.50 --> 00:04:01.50
It is a pretty awesome to read your book and then be sitting here talking to you.

42
00:04:02.50 --> 00:04:09.50
And before we jump into the book, let's talk about the book, the book jumps right into basically you and listing in the Army.

43
00:04:10.50 --> 00:04:12.50
Let's go back a little bit further than that.

44
00:04:13.50 --> 00:04:18.50
So you were born in the Navy yard in Brooklyn, and your dad was in the Navy.

45
00:04:18.50 --> 00:04:22.50
Yes, yes, I was born, Dad was stationed at the Brooklyn Navy yard in 1947.

46
00:04:23.50 --> 00:04:26.50
He had been on submarines during the Pacific.

47
00:04:26.50 --> 00:04:31.50
His first ship was the Lexington until it went down, and then he decided to transfer to submarines at that

48
00:04:31.50 --> 00:04:34.50
because he felt they were safe for then receiving dive bombers.

49
00:04:35.50 --> 00:04:39.50
So he was on the horse, he was on what ship in the battle of Coral City?

50
00:04:40.50 --> 00:04:41.50
The Lexington.

51
00:04:41.50 --> 00:04:43.50
And it went down and he got recovered by one of the other vessels.

52
00:04:43.50 --> 00:04:46.50
Yeah, he was in the water for about six hours before he got picked up by a destroyer.

53
00:04:46.50 --> 00:04:51.50
So then he transferred when he got out, he went back and transferred over to the submarine service.

54
00:04:52.50 --> 00:04:54.50
He thought that the submarines would be safer.

55
00:04:54.50 --> 00:04:55.50
He didn't like airplanes.

56
00:04:59.50 --> 00:05:08.50
So yeah, I was born at the Brooklyn Navy yard, and every three years after that for the rest of my life until I joined the Army, we moved to a different place.

57
00:05:08.50 --> 00:05:17.50
Constantly moving around, Dad jumped in from one submarine to another, and off at KUS, Naples Italy, Yoke Ahmed, Japan, Kuzbeur again.

58
00:05:18.50 --> 00:05:20.50
So quite extensive travel as a kid.

59
00:05:21.50 --> 00:05:24.50
And your dad was, was it a Mr. Guy in the beginning?

60
00:05:24.50 --> 00:05:26.50
He started as a listed, he was a master chief.

61
00:05:27.50 --> 00:05:30.50
He had 19 years in and then through the LDO program.

62
00:05:30.50 --> 00:05:39.50
Got promoted to a Lieutenant J. G. and stayed in to the Made Lieutenant Commander, and he got out in 1973.

63
00:05:40.50 --> 00:05:42.50
He was commanding the Navy base in Kuzbeurga.

64
00:05:43.50 --> 00:05:48.50
And what? So what was your dad like, I mean, was he going on deployments all the time when you were growing up or was that like?

65
00:05:48.50 --> 00:05:49.50
Yeah, Dad was gone a lot.

66
00:05:50.50 --> 00:05:54.50
But in those days, the old diesel subs, they go out for two or three weeks, and then he'd be back in.

67
00:05:55.50 --> 00:05:56.50
And mom ruled through, then.

68
00:05:56.50 --> 00:06:01.50
You know, I've been hit with a shoe, a spatula, a bill, to back up her hand.

69
00:06:02.50 --> 00:06:04.50
But Dad was a dysponarian.

70
00:06:05.50 --> 00:06:13.50
And from very young age, I was taught that you say, yes sir, no sir, yes ma'am, no man, and don't you dare get caught lying.

71
00:06:14.50 --> 00:06:17.50
There was nothing that made my dad matter than a kid you lying. I would get, he's spanking.

72
00:06:18.50 --> 00:06:19.50
Never got beaten.

73
00:06:20.50 --> 00:06:23.50
But my little fan he got worn out a couple of times by dad.

74
00:06:23.50 --> 00:06:27.50
I learned real quick. But he was a good man. So was mom.

75
00:06:28.50 --> 00:06:31.50
And so you're traveling around all these different places. Are you playing sports?

76
00:06:32.50 --> 00:06:34.50
What's like, what are your hobbies when you're growing up?

77
00:06:35.50 --> 00:06:35.50
Hunting.

78
00:06:36.50 --> 00:06:38.50
Dad taught me to shoot when I was seven years old.

79
00:06:39.50 --> 00:06:43.50
And any chance we had, we'd be out on the weekends out hunting someplace squirrel hunting or deer hunting.

80
00:06:44.50 --> 00:06:47.50
That was when we lived in Virginia and Connecticut.

81
00:06:47.50 --> 00:06:55.50
And it led me to play soccer because all my friends were Italians. And I learned to speak very good Italian. You come up my house.

82
00:06:56.50 --> 00:06:57.50
And that was the way I spoke Italian.

83
00:06:58.50 --> 00:07:01.50
But we, you have played a lot of baseball, softball when I was a kid.

84
00:07:02.50 --> 00:07:03.50
Typical kid things.

85
00:07:04.50 --> 00:07:04.50
Typical kid things.

86
00:07:05.50 --> 00:07:08.50
And so what do you do? Where were you when you graduated when you graduated from high school?

87
00:07:09.50 --> 00:07:10.50
I was in Yoko Harman, Japan.

88
00:07:10.50 --> 00:07:17.50
And there I learned to play football because we had to have every high school kid playing in order to have a team.

89
00:07:18.50 --> 00:07:23.50
All the boys playing anyway. And that's where I learned judo took judo lessons while I was over at the Kodakon.

90
00:07:24.50 --> 00:07:28.50
And really enjoyed my time in Japan. We were there for two years and I found it very enjoyable.

91
00:07:29.50 --> 00:07:35.50
So then when you graduated high school was your dad looking at you ready to throw you out at when you turned 18.

92
00:07:36.50 --> 00:07:37.50
All right, go. You can go figure it out now.

93
00:07:37.50 --> 00:07:42.50
Well, dad said the day I graduated, he said, son, you have three choices. You can go to college.

94
00:07:43.50 --> 00:07:46.50
You can go to work or you can go in the military.

95
00:07:47.50 --> 00:07:48.50
But the operative word is you can go.

96
00:07:49.50 --> 00:07:53.50
So two days after I graduated my high school went back to Oregon.

97
00:07:54.50 --> 00:07:55.50
I got a job on a log in the crew sitting at Chokers.

98
00:07:56.50 --> 00:07:57.50
And then went to college for a year.

99
00:07:58.50 --> 00:08:00.50
Then the next summer I shipped out on a merchant oil tanker.

100
00:08:01.50 --> 00:08:05.50
The SS American trader did two trips to from Oca now to Saudi Arabia on an oil tanker.

101
00:08:05.50 --> 00:08:10.50
And then came back and did another year of college and it was a pretty worthless year.

102
00:08:11.50 --> 00:08:12.50
So what year is this?

103
00:08:13.50 --> 00:08:16.50
This is in, I would say, I went to college in 65 and 66.

104
00:08:17.50 --> 00:08:18.50
I went out on the merchant mariners.

105
00:08:19.50 --> 00:08:22.50
And then when I came back 67 was the worthless year.

106
00:08:23.50 --> 00:08:28.50
And at the end of 67 dad was coming back from Japan and weight a little discussion about my future.

107
00:08:29.50 --> 00:08:30.50
And I was going to go back in the merchant mariners.

108
00:08:31.50 --> 00:08:33.50
He said, if you do that you'll never go back to college and he was right.

109
00:08:33.50 --> 00:08:35.50
I wouldn't have, I loved the merchant mariners.

110
00:08:36.50 --> 00:08:37.50
And I said, okay, I'm going to join the Marine Corps.

111
00:08:38.50 --> 00:08:39.50
He said, you joined the Marine Corps.

112
00:08:40.50 --> 00:08:41.50
They're going to take us both to the hospital.

113
00:08:42.50 --> 00:08:44.50
Extract my foot from your rear end.

114
00:08:45.50 --> 00:08:47.50
So I thought this conversation is going nowhere.

115
00:08:48.50 --> 00:08:49.50
You're over two.

116
00:08:50.50 --> 00:08:52.50
And he said, look it, you've got a private pilot's license.

117
00:08:53.50 --> 00:08:56.50
Why don't you go into that army one officer flight program?

118
00:08:57.50 --> 00:08:58.50
So the next day I went down signed up.

119
00:08:59.50 --> 00:09:01.50
So you had your private pilot license already?

120
00:09:01.50 --> 00:09:03.50
Yeah, the first two years I was in high school.

121
00:09:03.50 --> 00:09:04.50
We lived in Cusby, Oregon.

122
00:09:05.50 --> 00:09:07.50
And I got a job working at the airport,

123
00:09:07.50 --> 00:09:08.50
Refuel and airplanes.

124
00:09:09.50 --> 00:09:11.50
And instead of getting paid in cash,

125
00:09:12.50 --> 00:09:13.50
I got paid in flying lessons.

126
00:09:13.50 --> 00:09:17.50
So by doing that, I was going to get my private pilot license just before we went to Japan.

127
00:09:18.50 --> 00:09:21.50
So you like flying and your dad says your dad knew about this war and officer program.

128
00:09:22.50 --> 00:09:26.50
Did you recognize what was going to happen with this war and officer program?

129
00:09:27.50 --> 00:09:29.50
I mean, and that introduction that I just read, you know,

130
00:09:29.50 --> 00:09:33.50
that they needed pilots, they needed pilots for a reason.

131
00:09:34.50 --> 00:09:35.50
I mean, they were losing them.

132
00:09:36.50 --> 00:09:40.50
And did you just think, okay, well, that's, that's a path I'm going to take.

133
00:09:41.50 --> 00:09:43.50
I thought I'm getting out of college.

134
00:09:44.50 --> 00:09:48.50
I really didn't think much about, you know, what was happening over there?

135
00:09:48.50 --> 00:09:52.50
We'd see it on TV, you know, but, no, I just, I was determined.

136
00:09:52.50 --> 00:09:54.50
I was getting out of college one way or the other.

137
00:09:54.50 --> 00:09:56.50
And that was the path to get out of college right then and then air.

138
00:09:56.50 --> 00:10:00.50
I joined up. So this book, Undoanted Valor.

139
00:10:01.50 --> 00:10:05.50
There's actually, there's actually three books that you've written called Undoanted Valor.

140
00:10:05.50 --> 00:10:08.50
The first one is this one and a soul helicopter unit via NOM.

141
00:10:08.50 --> 00:10:13.50
The next one is called Medal of Honor and then Lamson 719.

142
00:10:13.50 --> 00:10:15.50
That's volume one, two and three.

143
00:10:16.50 --> 00:10:23.50
So in this book, you, the way you explain to me or the way that I understand it is that this first book,

144
00:10:23.50 --> 00:10:29.50
volume one, you're the lead character, even though the lead character has a different name, Dan Cory.

145
00:10:30.50 --> 00:10:31.50
That's, this is your story.

146
00:10:31.50 --> 00:10:33.50
That's correct. And I mean, it's real.

147
00:10:33.50 --> 00:10:38.50
I mean, if you're trying to cover up, you didn't do a great job because Dan Cory's dad was a master chief of the game.

148
00:10:38.50 --> 00:10:39.50
I'm an officer.

149
00:10:39.50 --> 00:10:42.50
Uh, then you, you know, he grew up in all these different places.

150
00:10:42.50 --> 00:10:45.50
And so you didn't do a good, is there a reason why you said, you know what?

151
00:10:45.50 --> 00:10:47.50
I'm going to change my name in this book.

152
00:10:47.50 --> 00:10:50.50
It just because my attorneys said that you want to change your name.

153
00:10:50.50 --> 00:10:53.50
You don't want to use your real name in the book.

154
00:10:53.50 --> 00:10:56.50
So that's the reason I come up with Dan Cory.

155
00:10:56.50 --> 00:10:59.50
Did you pull Dan Cory out of anyone?

156
00:10:59.50 --> 00:11:01.50
Was that a name that meant anything?

157
00:11:01.50 --> 00:11:03.50
Cory was a good friend of mine in college.

158
00:11:03.50 --> 00:11:06.50
And Dan, I just kind of pulled that one out of the air.

159
00:11:06.50 --> 00:11:07.50
Or so.

160
00:11:07.50 --> 00:11:08.50
Right on.

161
00:11:08.50 --> 00:11:12.50
Uh, so we're going to jump into this first book here a little bit.

162
00:11:12.50 --> 00:11:15.50
And, well, here we go.

163
00:11:15.50 --> 00:11:16.50
Okay.

164
00:11:16.50 --> 00:11:17.50
First chapter is called It begins.

165
00:11:17.50 --> 00:11:21.50
It says raising our right hands, we all took the oath of allegiance.

166
00:11:21.50 --> 00:11:27.50
Those of us that were flight school wannabes were escorted to a waiting cab that was to take us to the airport.

167
00:11:27.50 --> 00:11:32.50
We were there were anti war protesters blocking the front door.

168
00:11:32.50 --> 00:11:35.50
So we went out the back through an abandoned storefront.

169
00:11:35.50 --> 00:11:40.50
Instead of band playing as we went off to combat as our grandfather's had experienced.

170
00:11:40.50 --> 00:11:42.50
We were sneaking out the back door.

171
00:11:42.50 --> 00:11:44.50
That's correct.

172
00:11:44.50 --> 00:11:49.50
This is back in, uh, see this would been February of 68.

173
00:11:49.50 --> 00:11:52.50
And important to worry at that time as today.

174
00:11:52.50 --> 00:11:57.50
Uh, they had demonstrators outside the MEP station all in front of the MEP station.

175
00:11:57.50 --> 00:12:02.50
So what they had is the MEP station had a back door that went through an abandoned storefront.

176
00:12:02.50 --> 00:12:05.50
And they would take us in and bring us out through that back door.

177
00:12:05.50 --> 00:12:08.50
Uh, so that we didn't have to put up with the protesters around front.

178
00:12:08.50 --> 00:12:11.50
Yeah, and you said as your grandfather's, as your grandparents went off to war,

179
00:12:11.50 --> 00:12:14.50
this is actually your parents, your dad went off to war.

180
00:12:14.50 --> 00:12:19.50
Well, my dad and my grandfather, my grandfather was in the destroyers in World War I.

181
00:12:19.50 --> 00:12:25.50
Uh, served in the Navy back then and went to the big wars.

182
00:12:25.50 --> 00:12:27.50
Uh, fast forward a little bit.

183
00:12:27.50 --> 00:12:29.50
You get to boot camp.

184
00:12:29.50 --> 00:12:31.50
I'm highlight this one section of boot camp.

185
00:12:31.50 --> 00:12:38.50
The hill was a hundred yard dirt and gravel field with a steep slope of 50 feet at one end.

186
00:12:38.50 --> 00:12:41.50
We were lined up by squad and four ranks of 10 on command.

187
00:12:41.50 --> 00:12:43.50
We had to crawl to the top of the slope.

188
00:12:43.50 --> 00:12:46.50
When I reached the top, my hands knees and elbows were raw.

189
00:12:46.50 --> 00:12:50.50
For the next three days, we revisited the hill each evening before child.

190
00:12:50.50 --> 00:12:53.50
On the third day, I was really feeling sorry for myself.

191
00:12:53.50 --> 00:12:56.50
Suddenly, I had to come to Jesus moment.

192
00:12:56.50 --> 00:12:59.50
Hey, dumbass, you volunteered to be here.

193
00:12:59.50 --> 00:13:00.50
You weren't drafted.

194
00:13:00.50 --> 00:13:03.50
You quit college and volunteered for this shit.

195
00:13:03.50 --> 00:13:06.50
So stop your crying and suck it up.

196
00:13:06.50 --> 00:13:07.50
Yeah.

197
00:13:07.50 --> 00:13:09.50
It was, they held us.

198
00:13:09.50 --> 00:13:09.50
Yeah.

199
00:13:09.50 --> 00:13:10.50
It was kind of a frightening thing.

200
00:13:10.50 --> 00:13:13.50
Now you as a seal sitting there, you're chuckling because you think,

201
00:13:13.50 --> 00:13:15.50
My god, one of my children whimps going up the hill.

202
00:13:15.50 --> 00:13:19.50
But, you know, much guys that just got Muslim or draft ease.

203
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:20.50
Mm-hmm.

204
00:13:20.50 --> 00:13:24.50
And we were in a state of shock because that was the very first day in basic training.

205
00:13:24.50 --> 00:13:28.50
We spent five days in reception station and they treated you so nice.

206
00:13:28.50 --> 00:13:33.50
And then you get over to the company and, oh my god, the drill sergeants were devouring us.

207
00:13:33.50 --> 00:13:36.50
It's always start up this hill and I'm thinking, oh my god, this is.

208
00:13:36.50 --> 00:13:37.50
Yeah, this is killing my knees.

209
00:13:37.50 --> 00:13:38.50
It was all stones.

210
00:13:38.50 --> 00:13:43.50
Knees are getting torn up hands are getting torn up and on the third day, I had the, you know,

211
00:13:43.50 --> 00:13:46.50
premonition came, suck it up.

212
00:13:46.50 --> 00:13:51.50
So, so you're going to boot camp with just everyone, just normal, everyone that's going

213
00:13:51.50 --> 00:13:52.50
in the army.

214
00:13:52.50 --> 00:13:53.50
Oh yeah, yeah.

215
00:13:53.50 --> 00:13:54.50
Yeah.

216
00:13:54.50 --> 00:13:56.50
There's no, there's no special treatment because you're going in this war and officer program.

217
00:13:56.50 --> 00:13:57.50
No, no.

218
00:13:57.50 --> 00:14:01.50
Basic training was, you were thrown in with everybody, draft ease, national guard,

219
00:14:01.50 --> 00:14:11.50
just regular army guys and listed and y'all went to for puke, Luis, for polk, Luis and.

220
00:14:11.50 --> 00:14:14.50
Fast forward a little bit, you get done with basic training and look, you've got all, this is the thing.

221
00:14:14.50 --> 00:14:16.50
I always have to make this statement.

222
00:14:16.50 --> 00:14:18.50
I'm not reading the whole book.

223
00:14:18.50 --> 00:14:23.50
People, if you got to get the book to get all of it, but I'm so when it, when it might sound like it's

224
00:14:23.50 --> 00:14:24.50
jumping around, it is jumping around.

225
00:14:24.50 --> 00:14:26.50
I'm just jumping through sections.

226
00:14:26.50 --> 00:14:29.50
The story, you've got to, you've got a bunch of great stories in here.

227
00:14:29.50 --> 00:14:31.50
And, and there's just tons of lessons learned.

228
00:14:31.50 --> 00:14:32.50
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

229
00:14:32.50 --> 00:14:35.50
You get done with basic training and then you go to pre flight.

230
00:14:35.50 --> 00:14:40.50
And you say basic training, taught us discipline, pre flight is going to teach us attention to detail.

231
00:14:40.50 --> 00:14:43.50
Cadet Brady trade the 1800 briefing.

232
00:14:43.50 --> 00:14:45.50
Welcome to pre flight.

233
00:14:45.50 --> 00:14:47.50
I'm a holdover from a previous previous class.

234
00:14:47.50 --> 00:14:51.50
So me and the other cadets were directed to meet you and get you settled in.

235
00:14:51.50 --> 00:14:55.50
After tomorrow morning, we're just like you and in this with you.

236
00:14:55.50 --> 00:14:58.50
First formation will be at 0530 and it will be frightening.

237
00:14:58.50 --> 00:15:02.50
Our tack officers are warm officers who finish their flying tours and Vietnam.

238
00:15:02.50 --> 00:15:06.50
Now they're babysitting us and said, being instructor pilots and they're not happy about it.

239
00:15:06.50 --> 00:15:09.50
You can expect to get your ass smoked in the morning.

240
00:15:09.50 --> 00:15:12.50
Nothing you do will make them happy so be prepared for it.

241
00:15:12.50 --> 00:15:18.50
This is my second time going through this and I'll try to laugh my way through tomorrow morning because it's the only thing to do he explained.

242
00:15:18.50 --> 00:15:20.50
Yeah, it's all you could do.

243
00:15:20.50 --> 00:15:22.50
They smoked us that first morning.

244
00:15:22.50 --> 00:15:24.50
In fact, they smoked us all the way through pre flight.

245
00:15:24.50 --> 00:15:27.50
And the big thing at pre flight, and we didn't realize it at the time,

246
00:15:27.50 --> 00:15:34.50
was attention to detail because the quickest thing they'll get you killed in a helicopter is a broken safety wire.

247
00:15:34.50 --> 00:15:38.50
Or a bolt that's turned into slippage marks aren't lined up.

248
00:15:38.50 --> 00:15:41.50
So that's what they were adamant about there in pre flight.

249
00:15:41.50 --> 00:15:43.50
Is teach you attention to detail.

250
00:15:43.50 --> 00:15:45.50
How much detail?

251
00:15:45.50 --> 00:15:49.50
At the end of the third week, we had to take our belt buckle to part.

252
00:15:49.50 --> 00:15:54.50
Our brass belt buckles and clean the inside to get the pen to seal it out.

253
00:15:54.50 --> 00:15:56.50
Or they'd be tearing the belt buckle to part.

254
00:15:56.50 --> 00:15:59.50
Your shoes, your low court of shoes.

255
00:15:59.50 --> 00:16:06.50
You had to be sure and take a black magazine marker and go around the outside to cover up any stitching that it turned white.

256
00:16:06.50 --> 00:16:07.50
Your uniforms.

257
00:16:07.50 --> 00:16:14.50
You had to take black magic marker on your uniforms or your name tags rack and make sure that that thread hadn't turned any white.

258
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:15.50
Toothbrush.

259
00:16:15.50 --> 00:16:18.50
You'd better be sure there's no leftover toothpaste inside that toothbrush.

260
00:16:18.50 --> 00:16:23.50
It was all those kinds of things that they went through and it paid off.

261
00:16:23.50 --> 00:16:26.50
I mean, it really paid off once we got to the flight line.

262
00:16:26.50 --> 00:16:28.50
The idea of attention to detail.

263
00:16:28.50 --> 00:16:31.50
Yeah, that's a comment here.

264
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:35.50
But I went to Navy Bootcamp and I don't think it was as stringent as that.

265
00:16:35.50 --> 00:16:38.50
But and officer candidates called the same thing.

266
00:16:38.50 --> 00:16:43.50
Attention to details huge and I remember they had the drill instructors at officer candidates.

267
00:16:43.50 --> 00:16:51.50
They have a, they walk around a metal ruler in their pocket and they're measuring your folded underwear.

268
00:16:51.50 --> 00:16:57.50
To make sure that they are whatever it was, four and three quarters inches by four and three quarters is perfect square.

269
00:16:57.50 --> 00:16:58.50
That's what it's got to be.

270
00:16:58.50 --> 00:17:00.50
And if it's out, you fail.

271
00:17:00.50 --> 00:17:02.50
Attention to detail.

272
00:17:02.50 --> 00:17:05.50
Ars was rolled under where nine inches.

273
00:17:05.50 --> 00:17:06.50
There you go.

274
00:17:06.50 --> 00:17:09.50
So, and they had the rulers.

275
00:17:09.50 --> 00:17:13.50
And if they didn't like it, you'd come back and that barracks would be torn apart.

276
00:17:13.50 --> 00:17:15.50
Bids would be upside down matches is upside down.

277
00:17:15.50 --> 00:17:19.50
Everything out of foot lockers and tack off should be standing there waiting for you.

278
00:17:19.50 --> 00:17:20.50
God help you.

279
00:17:20.50 --> 00:17:27.50
Again, I hate to fast forward through so much good stuff, but I have to.

280
00:17:27.50 --> 00:17:36.50
On the flight school, we did get a pay raise coming to flight school as we were promoted from E1 or E2 privates to E5 sergeants.

281
00:17:36.50 --> 00:17:42.50
Our pay went from $98 to $225 a month, almost all extra pay went to two things.

282
00:17:42.50 --> 00:17:44.50
Haircuts and laundry bills.

283
00:17:44.50 --> 00:17:45.50
Yep.

284
00:17:45.50 --> 00:17:55.50
Every day, you'd spend half a day on the flight line in a flight suit and it was those gray flight suits over from the 60s at Air Force Corps.

285
00:17:55.50 --> 00:17:57.50
Navy war and orange one.

286
00:17:57.50 --> 00:18:01.50
The other half of the day, you were in fatigues.

287
00:18:01.50 --> 00:18:03.50
Starch fatigues.

288
00:18:03.50 --> 00:18:06.50
And they'd better not be broken over from yesterday.

289
00:18:06.50 --> 00:18:08.50
You'd better be breaking starch every day.

290
00:18:08.50 --> 00:18:14.50
And they would start so bad that you had to work at getting your leg down your pants or your arm down the sleeve.

291
00:18:14.50 --> 00:18:16.50
I mean, it was brutal starch.

292
00:18:16.50 --> 00:18:20.50
But by God, you had to do that every day in between haircuts and laundry bill.

293
00:18:20.50 --> 00:18:22.50
There went your pay raise right there.

294
00:18:22.50 --> 00:18:28.50
So that lasted well, and I know you were in the army until the 90s, but when I came in the Navy and when I got to seal team,

295
00:18:28.50 --> 00:18:33.50
I went out with going through basic seal training, the same thing, which is freaking crazy.

296
00:18:33.50 --> 00:18:42.50
Because that is the most pointless thing in the world to have combat uniforms, starched.

297
00:18:42.50 --> 00:18:45.50
And I think it was the Marine Corps.

298
00:18:45.50 --> 00:18:51.50
God bless him was the first service that I saw with a said, look, you don't starch those uniforms.

299
00:18:51.50 --> 00:18:56.50
And they started just looking like normal clothes, which was a good thing.

300
00:18:56.50 --> 00:19:03.50
I remember when the army got away from it, I think it was in the mid 70s that, you know, you don't need to start your fatigues anymore.

301
00:19:03.50 --> 00:19:09.50
And then definitely when the the BDUs came out, it was a big no known to get those things starched.

302
00:19:09.50 --> 00:19:14.50
Well, I was glad to see that. I wish the Navy would have known that because I had starched BDUs for the first 10 years of my career.

303
00:19:14.50 --> 00:19:16.50
Absolutely.

304
00:19:16.50 --> 00:19:19.50
That was a better fact. My son was going through some of my old gear the other day.

305
00:19:19.50 --> 00:19:23.50
He was picking up a fair fight, a pair of pants, they're freaking 20 or 30 years old.

306
00:19:23.50 --> 00:19:28.50
And there's still, you could put him on inspection ready, but it's so much a day and start.

307
00:19:28.50 --> 00:19:30.50
Boom.

308
00:19:30.50 --> 00:19:38.50
Once we completed fleet pre flight training, we entered a primary flight training at any one time in 1968.

309
00:19:38.50 --> 00:19:41.50
There were 10 flight companies in session.

310
00:19:41.50 --> 00:19:46.50
You ended up, you get to pick, well, you, I guess you draw what kind of helicopter you're going to fly.

311
00:19:46.50 --> 00:19:49.50
Now you're told, okay, you get your told and you get the TH55.

312
00:19:49.50 --> 00:19:51.50
Love that aircraft.

313
00:19:51.50 --> 00:19:56.50
Looks like a, looks like kind of a dragonfly looking for it.

314
00:19:56.50 --> 00:20:00.50
Yeah, it's the, it was bought, the army bought them right off the shelf from Hughes Aircraft.

315
00:20:00.50 --> 00:20:03.50
And it's in civilian world, it's a Hughes 300.

316
00:20:03.50 --> 00:20:10.50
You started the engine up, then you engaged the clutch, which engaged eight rubber bands that started turning the main rotor.

317
00:20:10.50 --> 00:20:12.50
And so we got that going for us.

318
00:20:12.50 --> 00:20:17.50
Yeah, I got down there on foot, but the thing had a ton of power and down there in Texas in the summer,

319
00:20:17.50 --> 00:20:22.50
the OH13's and the 23's, the other two training aircraft, they could barely get off the ground.

320
00:20:22.50 --> 00:20:24.50
TH55 would spring off the ground.

321
00:20:24.50 --> 00:20:28.50
So it was just a great little aircraft to fly. I loved it.

322
00:20:28.50 --> 00:20:29.50
Awesome.

323
00:20:29.50 --> 00:20:38.50
About two months into our flight training, we returned from the flight landing we were told to get in company formation right away.

324
00:20:38.50 --> 00:20:45.50
Once all 275 of us were assembled, as we'd have had about 75 drop out of the class at this point,

325
00:20:45.50 --> 00:20:48.50
our company commander came forward and addressed the class.

326
00:20:48.50 --> 00:20:51.50
One of our fellow classmates crashed that day and was killed.

327
00:20:51.50 --> 00:20:54.50
That was something none of us had considered at this point in our training.

328
00:20:54.50 --> 00:20:57.50
His death would not be the last either.

329
00:20:57.50 --> 00:21:05.50
Another student and his flight instructor were killed in a mid-air collision with another aircraft flown by someone from another class.

330
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:10.50
How there weren't a lot more merit mid-air collisions always amazed me.

331
00:21:10.50 --> 00:21:12.50
A little bit of a wake-up call?

332
00:21:12.50 --> 00:21:18.50
Well, it was, you know, you had roughly around 1200 aircraft at eight o'clock in the morning leaving.

333
00:21:18.50 --> 00:21:23.50
And coming back in at 11 o'clock and then leaving again at one o'clock and coming back at five o'clock.

334
00:21:23.50 --> 00:21:30.50
And most of them were flown by students. So, on students had anywhere from 10 hours to 50 hours,

335
00:21:30.50 --> 00:21:37.50
or let's see, yeah, got 100 hours total while you're in a flight school, early flight school, first days there.

336
00:21:37.50 --> 00:21:41.50
So, you had a lot of inexperience out there running around and not that big of an area.

337
00:21:41.50 --> 00:21:45.50
And why we didn't have a lot more air emitters? I have no idea.

338
00:21:45.50 --> 00:21:54.50
The one student, the first student that we lost, he flew into a cloud. And we hadn't had any weather instrument training yet at that point.

339
00:21:54.50 --> 00:21:58.50
Well, he went in the cloud and people had saw me came out of upside down, he was inverted.

340
00:21:58.50 --> 00:22:02.50
And you just don't invert in a helicopter, it doesn't work.

341
00:22:02.50 --> 00:22:07.50
So, that he got killed that way. Then the other one was a student and instructor and another aircraft slammed into them.

342
00:22:07.50 --> 00:22:09.50
We lost them in there.

343
00:22:09.50 --> 00:22:15.50
Those are the only two that I knew about there were others that did happen in other flight classes, but we were kind of fortunate.

344
00:22:15.50 --> 00:22:24.50
We started at with 350. We graduated. I think 150, somewhere on that neighborhood there.

345
00:22:24.50 --> 00:22:30.50
Good done with that. It's onto advanced flight training.

346
00:22:30.50 --> 00:22:37.50
This was, I kind of had to, there's a good leadership lesson here, but I wanted to jump into.

347
00:22:37.50 --> 00:22:42.50
Says we are approaching the end of our instrument training when we return to the barracks from the flight line.

348
00:22:42.50 --> 00:22:46.50
The night prior to the meteorology exam.

349
00:22:46.50 --> 00:22:54.50
Mr. Clinton wasn't happy with the condition of the barracks, and it gone on a rampage, aided by a bottle of jacked anios.

350
00:22:54.50 --> 00:23:06.50
Beds were overturned, wall lockers, contents were flying on the floor. The fire hose was spraying water and the contents of everyone's foot lockers were everywhere except in the foot lockers.

351
00:23:06.50 --> 00:23:08.50
He was on a tie-raight.

352
00:23:08.50 --> 00:23:12.50
One cadet was singled out. Mr. Clinton was burading him.

353
00:23:12.50 --> 00:23:16.50
Evidently the cadet was responsible for his five o'clock shadow.

354
00:23:16.50 --> 00:23:19.50
Mr. Clinton told the cadet to get into the push-up position.

355
00:23:19.50 --> 00:23:23.50
Once there he placed a razor on the floor and front of him and told him to shave.

356
00:23:23.50 --> 00:23:26.50
The cadet looked scared, and I was mad.

357
00:23:26.50 --> 00:23:30.50
I had had enough of Mr. Clinton's crap with all respect for his rank that I could master.

358
00:23:30.50 --> 00:23:32.50
I stepped forward and got in Clinton's face.

359
00:23:32.50 --> 00:23:40.50
Sir, you've been drinking and you are drunk. If you do not leave this minute, I'm going straight to the company commander and have him resolve this situation.

360
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:42.50
Now leave. I shouted.

361
00:23:42.50 --> 00:23:45.50
There was dead silence.

362
00:23:45.50 --> 00:23:49.50
Mr. Clinton just stood there and glared at me with his bloodshot eyes. Everyone was watching.

363
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:53.50
Finally, he laughed, turned, and staggered out of the barracks.

364
00:23:53.50 --> 00:23:55.50
Everyone including me, side with relief.

365
00:23:55.50 --> 00:24:01.50
We spent most of the night getting the barracks back in order, and no one had an opportunity to study for the weather exam.

366
00:24:01.50 --> 00:24:06.50
It showed the next day. The exam was in the morning when we returned to the barracks after flying in the afternoon.

367
00:24:06.50 --> 00:24:11.50
We were immediately informed by the company first sergeant that we were all restricted to the barracks until further notice.

368
00:24:11.50 --> 00:24:14.50
And I was to report to the company commander's office.

369
00:24:14.50 --> 00:24:18.50
When I arrived, the senior officer from the weather committee was present as well.

370
00:24:18.50 --> 00:24:19.50
I was told to sit down.

371
00:24:19.50 --> 00:24:21.50
Cadet, Cory.

372
00:24:21.50 --> 00:24:26.50
Do you know why I've restricted the company and called you here? The company commander asked?

373
00:24:26.50 --> 00:24:29.50
Like I was some clairvoyant and I could read his mind.

374
00:24:29.50 --> 00:24:32.50
This was the first time I'd ever spoken to the man.

375
00:24:32.50 --> 00:24:35.50
Again, dad's words of wisdom came to mind.

376
00:24:35.50 --> 00:24:39.50
No sir, I replied, knowing this wasn't the time to be a smart ass.

377
00:24:39.50 --> 00:24:43.50
It appears Cadet, Cory, that most of your class failed the weather exam.

378
00:24:43.50 --> 00:24:45.50
We need to know why he stated.

379
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:48.50
Oh shit, most in the class which includes me too.

380
00:24:48.50 --> 00:24:51.50
Again, as class leader who is my fault.

381
00:24:51.50 --> 00:24:56.50
Didn't you study for the exam last night asked the weather committee instructor who didn't look happy?

382
00:24:56.50 --> 00:25:01.50
Why did I suspect that shit rolled downhill here and it was coming high at me?

383
00:25:01.50 --> 00:25:05.50
However, I was seeing a U-turn for this shitstorm.

384
00:25:05.50 --> 00:25:08.50
No sir, we did not study last night.

385
00:25:08.50 --> 00:25:10.50
We had a party instead.

386
00:25:10.50 --> 00:25:14.50
I replied, their eyes bulged and I thought both men were going to drop dead from heart attacks.

387
00:25:14.50 --> 00:25:16.50
You did what gagged the company commander.

388
00:25:16.50 --> 00:25:20.50
You had a party the night before the most important exams in this course.

389
00:25:20.50 --> 00:25:25.50
Do you realize by having a party and failing that exam, you could all fail flight school and be sent to infantry immediately?

390
00:25:25.50 --> 00:25:28.50
Yes sir, I replied and let them stew on this revelation.

391
00:25:28.50 --> 00:25:31.50
Now the weather instructor had a grin on his face as he turned to the company commander.

392
00:25:31.50 --> 00:25:36.50
Well, I guess the problem wasn't with the instruction, but with a discipline of these cadets.

393
00:25:36.50 --> 00:25:38.50
I was beginning to see what was going on here.

394
00:25:38.50 --> 00:25:43.50
Somewhere above their level, the shit had hit the fan and someone high up was looking for somewhere to lay the blame.

395
00:25:43.50 --> 00:25:49.50
The army needed helicopter pilots at this point had spent considerable money training 80 cadets.

396
00:25:49.50 --> 00:25:52.50
The army couldn't afford to wash out 80 cadets at one time.

397
00:25:52.50 --> 00:25:55.50
The company commander wasn't looking too good right about now.

398
00:25:55.50 --> 00:26:00.50
Could that Cory why in the hell would you have a party the night before major exam?

399
00:26:00.50 --> 00:26:02.50
Sir, we had no choice.

400
00:26:02.50 --> 00:26:03.50
I answered sheepishly.

401
00:26:03.50 --> 00:26:05.50
I was beginning to enjoy this.

402
00:26:05.50 --> 00:26:10.50
I'd been around the military long enough to know when people were to stay to panic over something that had gone terribly wrong.

403
00:26:10.50 --> 00:26:11.50
Oh, dad, you taught me well.

404
00:26:11.50 --> 00:26:12.50
What the hell do you mean?

405
00:26:12.50 --> 00:26:14.50
You had no choice the company commander.

406
00:26:14.50 --> 00:26:18.50
Sir, when we returned from flight line last night, Mr. Clinton had torn apart the barracks to include,

407
00:26:18.50 --> 00:26:21.50
turning on the fire hose and told us to get the mess cleaned up before morning.

408
00:26:21.50 --> 00:26:26.50
We had a barracks cleaning party to get it squared away and not took until midnight.

409
00:26:26.50 --> 00:26:32.50
Light out lights out was at 2200, but we worked on stuff until dark until we had it taken care of.

410
00:26:32.50 --> 00:26:36.50
Only the married man had a chance to study last night.

411
00:26:36.50 --> 00:26:39.50
You're dismissed, cadet Cory, and there you go.

412
00:26:39.50 --> 00:26:46.50
So you, you then up, you go to the company commander, then you end up with a battalion commander and the school combat.

413
00:26:46.50 --> 00:26:49.50
And the school commander finally.

414
00:26:49.50 --> 00:26:53.50
Uh, you end up all assembled.

415
00:26:53.50 --> 00:26:55.50
The battalion commander comes out.

416
00:26:55.50 --> 00:26:58.50
I am Lieutenant Colonel Barlow, your battalion commander.

417
00:26:58.50 --> 00:27:01.50
I've not met most of you and normally do not meet cadets until graduation.

418
00:27:01.50 --> 00:27:04.50
However, because of this incident, I've met some of you and thought I should meet all of you.

419
00:27:04.50 --> 00:27:07.50
What you've experienced is not typical of the treatment of cadets.

420
00:27:07.50 --> 00:27:08.50
Changes have been made.

421
00:27:08.50 --> 00:27:10.50
The first being that you have a new company commander.

422
00:27:10.50 --> 00:27:13.50
Major, kiddo will be your company commander for the remainder of your training.

423
00:27:13.50 --> 00:27:18.50
Mr. Clinton, in fact, in first class moron will no longer be your tax either.

424
00:27:18.50 --> 00:27:21.50
Major, kiddo, and he turns it over.

425
00:27:21.50 --> 00:27:24.50
The, uh, back up a little bit.

426
00:27:24.50 --> 00:27:29.50
Our class got a bad rap the very first day we showed up.

427
00:27:29.50 --> 00:27:33.50
Me and another guy, we had flown into Savannah the night before.

428
00:27:33.50 --> 00:27:35.50
So we had a 1200 hour report.

429
00:27:35.50 --> 00:27:37.50
Him and I got there at about 11.

430
00:27:37.50 --> 00:27:39.50
So we, we were poured on time.

431
00:27:39.50 --> 00:27:45.50
The rest of the guys, they all flew in on a flight that was supposed to land at eight o'clock in the morning, but didn't because of the weather.

432
00:27:45.50 --> 00:27:47.50
So they all showed up on hour late.

433
00:27:47.50 --> 00:27:50.50
So that set Clinton off.

434
00:27:50.50 --> 00:27:55.50
And for eight weeks, we never got a pass to get off the base.

435
00:27:55.50 --> 00:27:58.50
Where every other class had blanket passes on the weekends.

436
00:27:58.50 --> 00:28:02.50
And so Clinton and the man had had a drinking problem.

437
00:28:02.50 --> 00:28:06.50
This wasn't the first incident with him, but this is the one that broke camel's back.

438
00:28:06.50 --> 00:28:12.50
Uh, when he, when he went through that, that weather exam, as I said in the book,

439
00:28:12.50 --> 00:28:13.50
you couldn't afford it.

440
00:28:13.50 --> 00:28:16.50
The flunk 79 guy is right now.

441
00:28:16.50 --> 00:28:19.50
Somebody was going to go ballistic over this.

442
00:28:19.50 --> 00:28:25.50
So it worked its way up and thank God and we got to the Berge commander's office and they asked me they said,

443
00:28:25.50 --> 00:28:27.50
Why do you think Mr. Clinton did that?

444
00:28:27.50 --> 00:28:30.50
I said, well sir, because he was drunk.

445
00:28:30.50 --> 00:28:32.50
Well, the three of them looked at me.

446
00:28:32.50 --> 00:28:34.50
Like, do you know what you just said?

447
00:28:34.50 --> 00:28:37.50
You accused an officer of this?

448
00:28:37.50 --> 00:28:39.50
Well, I was a little bit older than most cadets.

449
00:28:39.50 --> 00:28:40.50
I joined the army.

450
00:28:40.50 --> 00:28:41.50
I was 21.

451
00:28:41.50 --> 00:28:43.50
The day I came in.

452
00:28:43.50 --> 00:28:47.50
And all the other classmates, they were 19, 20 year olds.

453
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:50.50
And been around the military all my life.

454
00:28:50.50 --> 00:28:52.50
I had an idea how things worked.

455
00:28:52.50 --> 00:28:54.50
So I was going to play my Trump cards.

456
00:28:54.50 --> 00:28:58.50
And that's where I played the Trump card and it's with them for gay commander.

457
00:28:58.50 --> 00:29:02.50
No, over the next couple of days, they called in every day they call in three guys.

458
00:29:02.50 --> 00:29:05.50
And they'd asked them the same questions.

459
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:07.50
And everybody backed my comments up.

460
00:29:07.50 --> 00:29:11.50
So we got Mr. Clinton, got rhythm Mr. Clinton, got rhythm,

461
00:29:11.50 --> 00:29:13.50
got rhythm, got a sergeant moron.

462
00:29:13.50 --> 00:29:15.50
And I used the name Sergeant moron.

463
00:29:15.50 --> 00:29:17.50
I never heard the guy ever speak.

464
00:29:17.50 --> 00:29:22.50
He had tattoos covering him everywhere before tattoos were popular.

465
00:29:22.50 --> 00:29:26.50
And so I don't know anything about the man outside of he never said anything.

466
00:29:26.50 --> 00:29:28.50
So I figured it was more.

467
00:29:28.50 --> 00:29:32.50
But then after that, we went into our advanced training.

468
00:29:32.50 --> 00:29:37.50
He would transition the following Monday morning and things went along really well after that with the unit.

469
00:29:37.50 --> 00:29:39.50
Major kid, him, it was a great guy.

470
00:29:39.50 --> 00:29:41.50
How'd you like that he would when you started flying it?

471
00:29:41.50 --> 00:29:42.50
I loved it.

472
00:29:42.50 --> 00:29:44.50
I still love the hewint to this day.

473
00:29:44.50 --> 00:29:49.50
The hewis of fantastic aircraft had plenty of power even the Delta models had plenty of power.

474
00:29:49.50 --> 00:29:52.50
They were forgiving.

475
00:29:52.50 --> 00:29:57.50
They were just they were dream the fly and they still are.

476
00:29:57.50 --> 00:29:59.50
Isn't it crazy?

477
00:29:59.50 --> 00:30:00.50
Oh, I guess it's not too crazy.

478
00:30:00.50 --> 00:30:03.50
I mean, I joined the Navy in 1990.

479
00:30:03.50 --> 00:30:06.50
And we still had hewis and they're still hewis right now.

480
00:30:06.50 --> 00:30:09.50
The army's put it all layers and you see him.

481
00:30:09.50 --> 00:30:10.50
What about the Marine Corps?

482
00:30:10.50 --> 00:30:12.50
The Marine Corps has got a different hewis.

483
00:30:12.50 --> 00:30:14.50
They got a big beefed up one muskiller thanks.

484
00:30:14.50 --> 00:30:15.50
So it's twin engines.

485
00:30:15.50 --> 00:30:21.50
I'm not sure if it's got four rotor blades or just two but they've got a beefed up hewis.

486
00:30:21.50 --> 00:30:24.50
That's much bigger than the army's ever wore.

487
00:30:24.50 --> 00:30:26.50
So it's great aircraft.

488
00:30:26.50 --> 00:30:28.50
I mean, why wouldn't still be using today?

489
00:30:28.50 --> 00:30:29.50
I don't know.

490
00:30:29.50 --> 00:30:30.50
I mean, I've got the black hawks and the other.

491
00:30:30.50 --> 00:30:31.50
They're way bigger.

492
00:30:31.50 --> 00:30:33.50
I mean, they're way smaller than the black hawks.

493
00:30:33.50 --> 00:30:34.50
Oh yeah.

494
00:30:34.50 --> 00:30:35.50
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:30:35.50 --> 00:30:38.50
We could get six combat troops.

496
00:30:38.50 --> 00:30:44.50
Besides the crew crew for board and had power to, you know, to do things and stuff like that.

497
00:30:44.50 --> 00:30:48.50
The black hawk when we assaulted into Iraq.

498
00:30:48.50 --> 00:30:50.50
Back during desert storm.

499
00:30:50.50 --> 00:30:57.50
There was 15 guys in my aircraft with me and my RTO is my and I had one squad of infantrymen with me when we went in.

500
00:30:57.50 --> 00:31:00.50
So much more power, much more much faster aircraft.

501
00:31:00.50 --> 00:31:01.50
And it was an aircraft.

502
00:31:01.50 --> 00:31:02.50
The black hawk.

503
00:31:02.50 --> 00:31:04.50
I was on the testbed for it.

504
00:31:04.50 --> 00:31:07.50
They were designed in case we went into war with Iran.

505
00:31:07.50 --> 00:31:09.50
And that's that's really what we were looking at as an aircraft.

506
00:31:09.50 --> 00:31:14.50
They could get the altitude of the mountainous out, mountain out to the two to round a ran.

507
00:31:14.50 --> 00:31:19.50
They were placed the Huey and the black hawk was the, the choice over it.

508
00:31:19.50 --> 00:31:23.50
They first to there was a Boeing put a proposal up for the U-tass.

509
00:31:23.50 --> 00:31:25.50
And then, of course, he put a proposal up for the U-tass.

510
00:31:25.50 --> 00:31:30.50
It was called U-tass at that time utility tactical transport system.

511
00:31:30.50 --> 00:31:32.50
And of course, he's the one that won.

512
00:31:32.50 --> 00:31:42.50
So, and it seems like when you look at the Huey, it's like a friggin' nineteen sixty-nine muscle car.

513
00:31:42.50 --> 00:31:45.50
Just in terms of, hey, that's the engine.

514
00:31:45.50 --> 00:31:49.50
You see the aircraft now, the helicopters.

515
00:31:49.50 --> 00:31:54.50
There's so many computer parts to it's like when you open up the hood of a car nowadays.

516
00:31:54.50 --> 00:31:57.50
You don't know what the hell's in there, right?

517
00:31:57.50 --> 00:32:00.50
You can't fix any of it with a wrench.

518
00:32:00.50 --> 00:32:03.50
Look at the Huey, who's the guy crew in the Huey?

519
00:32:03.50 --> 00:32:06.50
The guy was eighteen, nineteen years old, maybe twenty.

520
00:32:06.50 --> 00:32:08.50
And he was the crew chief.

521
00:32:08.50 --> 00:32:10.50
And what those kids did with those engines was just amazing.

522
00:32:10.50 --> 00:32:15.50
They'd work on them and, you know, I was a pilot and the most dangerous thing you could do is let the pilot up there around the engine.

523
00:32:15.50 --> 00:32:17.50
My crew chief wouldn't dare do that.

524
00:32:17.50 --> 00:32:20.50
But these kids, they really maintain those things well.

525
00:32:20.50 --> 00:32:24.50
And what they couldn't do at the operator level at the crew chief level.

526
00:32:24.50 --> 00:32:27.50
They went into the maintenance level, which is right there with our unit.

527
00:32:27.50 --> 00:32:32.50
And they were all nineteen and twenty year olds, known the sheet metal work and the electronics.

528
00:32:32.50 --> 00:32:37.50
I took a bullet through the, through the wiring bundle one day.

529
00:32:37.50 --> 00:32:40.50
And the wiring bundle was about that thick.

530
00:32:40.50 --> 00:32:45.50
And it was maybe thirty five forty white wires in there.

531
00:32:45.50 --> 00:32:50.50
And I saw a kid sitting down and sit there and put each one of those wires back properly to each one of them.

532
00:32:50.50 --> 00:32:54.50
To get the, to get the communications and the electronics all working.

533
00:32:54.50 --> 00:32:59.50
To me, it was a bunch of spaghetti.

534
00:32:59.50 --> 00:33:00.50
Yeah.

535
00:33:00.50 --> 00:33:04.50
So let's fast forward a little bit.

536
00:33:04.50 --> 00:33:08.50
Let's get to, let's get to Vietnam.

537
00:33:08.50 --> 00:33:16.50
The flight from Fort Lewis, Washington to Vietnam was fourteen hours in the two hour stop at Yucada Air Force Base outside of Tokyo, Japan.

538
00:33:16.50 --> 00:33:19.50
The plane was a commercial airliner contract by the government.

539
00:33:19.50 --> 00:33:23.50
Most Air Force transport aircraft were carrying cargo and not passengers.

540
00:33:23.50 --> 00:33:27.50
We arrived in Cameron Bay, Vietnam in the dead of night.

541
00:33:27.50 --> 00:33:32.50
Jumping forward a little bit.

542
00:33:32.50 --> 00:33:34.50
You get to where you're going.

543
00:33:34.50 --> 00:33:40.50
A Jeep came this and look, in order to get there, I got a bypass all the bunch of good stuff.

544
00:33:40.50 --> 00:33:41.50
Get the book.

545
00:33:41.50 --> 00:33:44.50
A Jeep came to stop in front of me with a handless captain driving.

546
00:33:44.50 --> 00:33:45.50
You Mr. Corey?

547
00:33:45.50 --> 00:33:46.50
Yes sir.

548
00:33:46.50 --> 00:33:49.50
I snapped to a chance, tension and saluted and saluted.

549
00:33:49.50 --> 00:33:50.50
Shit.

550
00:33:50.50 --> 00:33:53.50
You're trying to get me shot. Damn sniper sees you doing that.

551
00:33:53.50 --> 00:33:55.50
I'm going to be the one that's going to get shot.

552
00:33:55.50 --> 00:33:57.50
Don't you have, I don't have a hat on for a reason.

553
00:33:57.50 --> 00:33:58.50
So get your shit and let's go.

554
00:33:58.50 --> 00:34:00.50
He said with a disgusted tone.

555
00:34:00.50 --> 00:34:01.50
Sorry sir.

556
00:34:01.50 --> 00:34:03.50
I tossed my duffel bags into the Jeep and climbed in.

557
00:34:03.50 --> 00:34:05.50
He extended his hand and grinned.

558
00:34:05.50 --> 00:34:06.50
There's no sniper's here.

559
00:34:06.50 --> 00:34:08.50
Just thought I'd scare the crap out of you.

560
00:34:08.50 --> 00:34:10.50
I'm Captain Goodnight.

561
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:13.50
The operations officer for our Mary Band.

562
00:34:13.50 --> 00:34:14.50
Welcome to the chicken coop.

563
00:34:14.50 --> 00:34:17.50
The chicken coop is the company location.

564
00:34:17.50 --> 00:34:20.50
And this here is the parking area and the is the chicken pen.

565
00:34:20.50 --> 00:34:22.50
Our call sign is chicken man.

566
00:34:22.50 --> 00:34:23.50
Chicken man.

567
00:34:23.50 --> 00:34:25.50
That's our call sign I responded.

568
00:34:25.50 --> 00:34:29.50
That's our art and still encourage in the hearts of our troops and fear in the minds of the enemy.

569
00:34:29.50 --> 00:34:31.50
Why couldn't it be something bold and dynamic?

570
00:34:31.50 --> 00:34:33.50
I thought chicken man.

571
00:34:33.50 --> 00:34:35.50
Sir, how do we come by that call sign I asked?

572
00:34:35.50 --> 00:34:37.50
The official call sign is drumstick.

573
00:34:37.50 --> 00:34:40.50
There's a popular radio show in the Chicago area.

574
00:34:40.50 --> 00:34:46.50
Now it's on armed forces radio and Vietnam about a wicked white winged warrior called chicken man.

575
00:34:46.50 --> 00:34:49.50
Some of the episodes are hilarious.

576
00:34:49.50 --> 00:34:52.50
When the unit first came to nom, we were the hoot owls.

577
00:34:52.50 --> 00:34:56.50
And the name has changed several times over the years to Apache and lucky shot,

578
00:34:56.50 --> 00:35:01.50
1966, sidewinder and swordfish in 1967 and drumstick in 1968.

579
00:35:01.50 --> 00:35:06.50
Some of the war officers decided about six months ago to start using chicken man call sign.

580
00:35:06.50 --> 00:35:08.50
And it's pretty much stuck.

581
00:35:08.50 --> 00:35:11.50
So now it's the unofficial call sign for the unit.

582
00:35:11.50 --> 00:35:14.50
I was starting to like this chicken man call sign now.

583
00:35:14.50 --> 00:35:22.50
The, the, the, you got to understand war officers back then.

584
00:35:22.50 --> 00:35:29.50
Again, they're all 19 year olds, somewhere 18, 20 year olds.

585
00:35:29.50 --> 00:35:31.50
And it's 60s.

586
00:35:31.50 --> 00:35:39.50
So, you know, once you got out of flight school, your hair regulation kind of slipped and you're trying to grow a mustache when you don't have any hair to grow a mustache.

587
00:35:39.50 --> 00:35:41.50
And what are they going to do to you?

588
00:35:41.50 --> 00:35:44.50
And then you're going to do that.

589
00:35:44.50 --> 00:35:47.50
Benjud dog tags and send you to Vietnam.

590
00:35:47.50 --> 00:35:49.50
You're already there.

591
00:35:49.50 --> 00:35:52.50
So, war officers were kind of a rebellious bunch to the army.

592
00:35:52.50 --> 00:35:56.50
We had the war officer protection association that, you know, if something was going right in the unit, all the warrants, you get together and bitch about it.

593
00:35:56.50 --> 00:36:02.50
But, so when they came up with this name drumstick, everybody did, you know, thought, oh my god, what a stupid name.

594
00:36:02.50 --> 00:36:06.50
And then the chicken man series started on AFVN.

595
00:36:06.50 --> 00:36:08.50
And then it stuck.

596
00:36:08.50 --> 00:36:13.50
And even after they changed the name drumstick officially.

597
00:36:13.50 --> 00:36:16.50
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

598
00:36:16.50 --> 00:36:17.50
Chicken man, chicken man.

599
00:36:17.50 --> 00:36:19.50
We still kept the chicken man calls signer.

600
00:36:19.50 --> 00:36:20.50
We never gave it up.

601
00:36:20.50 --> 00:36:25.50
And like on the front of the book there, it's got a picture of the aircraft with the chicken on the nose.

602
00:36:25.50 --> 00:36:29.50
And we never took the chickens off the nose.

603
00:36:29.50 --> 00:36:32.50
Awesome.

604
00:36:32.50 --> 00:36:35.50
So, you're going through kind of in dock.

605
00:36:35.50 --> 00:36:38.50
You're learning what's going on there.

606
00:36:38.50 --> 00:36:39.50
And finally, we get to this.

607
00:36:39.50 --> 00:36:41.50
How much flying are we getting I asked?

608
00:36:41.50 --> 00:36:44.50
Every newbie asked that question, Captain Goodnight, chimed in.

609
00:36:44.50 --> 00:36:48.50
You'll get all the flying you want and more than you can handle.

610
00:36:48.50 --> 00:36:50.50
There'll be days when you go to bed with your butt cheeks hurting.

611
00:36:50.50 --> 00:36:52.50
And there'll still be hurting when you wake up.

612
00:36:52.50 --> 00:36:54.50
And you have another 12 to 15 hour day ahead of you.

613
00:36:54.50 --> 00:36:57.50
Some days you'll get 20 hours in before you shut the engine down.

614
00:36:57.50 --> 00:37:02.50
Normally when you get 140 hours for the month, you get a two day stand down.

615
00:37:02.50 --> 00:37:04.50
If I don't need you.

616
00:37:04.50 --> 00:37:06.50
Yes, cleaned is another individual walked in.

617
00:37:06.50 --> 00:37:07.50
This is Lou Price.

618
00:37:07.50 --> 00:37:11.50
He's going to show you where you can set up housekeeping.

619
00:37:11.50 --> 00:37:16.50
Lou Price was probably absolutely one of the best telecopter pilots ever knew.

620
00:37:16.50 --> 00:37:20.50
Lou was 21 years old.

621
00:37:20.50 --> 00:37:25.50
His first mission in Vietnam was about six about eight months before I got there.

622
00:37:25.50 --> 00:37:27.50
And it was into the Oshia Valley.

623
00:37:27.50 --> 00:37:32.50
He flew in and he walked out because his aircraft landed upside down.

624
00:37:32.50 --> 00:37:35.50
And he had a punch his way through the greenhouse bubble.

625
00:37:35.50 --> 00:37:38.50
They were shot down going into the aircraft for old.

626
00:37:38.50 --> 00:37:42.50
Lou, he left after the year.

627
00:37:42.50 --> 00:37:46.50
And in the book, as you see, he came back about eight months later.

628
00:37:46.50 --> 00:37:48.50
He said, Vietnam was a hell of a lot safer.

629
00:37:48.50 --> 00:37:50.50
They'd been an instructor at Flight School.

630
00:37:50.50 --> 00:37:53.50
And Lou stayed for the next year.

631
00:37:53.50 --> 00:37:58.50
And he had been discharged from the army.

632
00:37:58.50 --> 00:38:00.50
And was still flying in Vietnam.

633
00:38:00.50 --> 00:38:05.50
They had to get a Marine escort, I mean, a NPS court to come and get him and taking back.

634
00:38:05.50 --> 00:38:10.50
And it was because the first cab division had left all of our personnel records had left.

635
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:13.50
And so they didn't know how much time anybody had left in the unit.

636
00:38:13.50 --> 00:38:15.50
So Lou just, he was enjoying it.

637
00:38:15.50 --> 00:38:20.50
He was flying his beer drink, flying his helicopter drink and his beer had nothing better to do.

638
00:38:20.50 --> 00:38:21.50
So Lou just stayed and fired.

639
00:38:21.50 --> 00:38:24.50
They had to bring an MPs up to get him out of there.

640
00:38:24.50 --> 00:38:26.50
Lou, he let out out.

641
00:38:26.50 --> 00:38:32.50
Last I heard Lou had been a financial advisor to a major corporation before he passed away.

642
00:38:32.50 --> 00:38:34.50
But he was a great pilot.

643
00:38:34.50 --> 00:38:38.50
Awesome.

644
00:38:38.50 --> 00:38:43.50
You did note in here that there was a latest lead Zeppelin song was playing on a real, real,

645
00:38:43.50 --> 00:38:44.50
real tape player.

646
00:38:44.50 --> 00:38:45.50
Oh yeah.

647
00:38:45.50 --> 00:38:46.50
He's wild.

648
00:38:46.50 --> 00:38:49.50
I was talking to this, so I have a song whose 18 years old.

649
00:38:49.50 --> 00:38:52.50
And he listens to Metallica.

650
00:38:52.50 --> 00:38:55.50
So when I was thinking about this,

651
00:38:55.50 --> 00:38:58.50
the first lead Zeppelin album came out like 1968.

652
00:38:58.50 --> 00:39:00.50
I was born in 1971.

653
00:39:00.50 --> 00:39:04.50
And when I grew up, lead Zeppelin seemed really old, right?

654
00:39:04.50 --> 00:39:05.50
They seemed so old.

655
00:39:05.50 --> 00:39:09.50
I mean, I love Led Zeppelin, but they seemed like they were way before my time.

656
00:39:09.50 --> 00:39:13.50
Well, my son was born in 2002.

657
00:39:13.50 --> 00:39:19.50
The first Metallica album came out in 1983.

658
00:39:19.50 --> 00:39:20.50
That's old.

659
00:39:20.50 --> 00:39:24.50
So like way before he's way older than Metallica.

660
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:28.50
He's much further away from Metallica's beginning than I was from Led Zeppelin.

661
00:39:28.50 --> 00:39:29.50
Opening.

662
00:39:29.50 --> 00:39:31.50
You know, it's crazy how that time goes by.

663
00:39:31.50 --> 00:39:34.50
But you guys were there and the thick of it, listening to some Zeppelin.

664
00:39:34.50 --> 00:39:36.50
Has your son ever heard of David?

665
00:39:36.50 --> 00:39:37.50
Oh yeah.

666
00:39:37.50 --> 00:39:38.50
Oh yeah.

667
00:39:38.50 --> 00:39:39.50
I love playing on guitar.

668
00:39:39.50 --> 00:39:40.50
I still play it around the house.

669
00:39:40.50 --> 00:39:43.50
My wife looks at me because we're going to have one of those moments.

670
00:39:43.50 --> 00:39:48.50
This is always a good, good thing to do here.

671
00:39:48.50 --> 00:39:50.50
You just kind of talk about some of the characters.

672
00:39:50.50 --> 00:39:52.50
The pilots were mixed back.

673
00:39:52.50 --> 00:39:55.50
Most of the war officers fell into one of three categories either.

674
00:39:55.50 --> 00:39:59.50
High school graduates college dropouts or former NCOs that had gone to flight school.

675
00:39:59.50 --> 00:40:04.50
Most of the warrants were bachelor's with girlfriends back in the states.

676
00:40:04.50 --> 00:40:08.50
Except the old guys who were married with wives and two kids back in the states.

677
00:40:08.50 --> 00:40:10.50
The commissioned officers.

678
00:40:10.50 --> 00:40:16.50
I was you call them real live officers or RLOs as warrants refer to them.

679
00:40:16.50 --> 00:40:20.50
We're all college graduates, but I didn't notice any west pointers in the unit.

680
00:40:20.50 --> 00:40:23.50
They were all in the same position by the large ring on their finger.

681
00:40:23.50 --> 00:40:25.50
Hence the nickname ring knockers.

682
00:40:25.50 --> 00:40:28.50
Although no one did PT, there were no overweight pilots.

683
00:40:28.50 --> 00:40:31.50
Most were attempting to grow moustaches with limited success.

684
00:40:31.50 --> 00:40:33.50
We were all just too baby-faced.

685
00:40:33.50 --> 00:40:37.50
Most of the crew chiefs in maintenance personnel were volunteers who had enlisted rather than

686
00:40:37.50 --> 00:40:38.50
waiting to be drafted.

687
00:40:38.50 --> 00:40:40.50
There were 29 draftees.

688
00:40:40.50 --> 00:40:45.50
The most were doorgunners who had volunteered to extend for doorgunner duty to cut their

689
00:40:45.50 --> 00:40:49.50
draft time short or to put more money in their pockets before going home.

690
00:40:49.50 --> 00:40:51.50
They were all good soldiers.

691
00:40:51.50 --> 00:40:55.50
There was an occasional drunk and disorderly and maybe an occasional pot used.

692
00:40:55.50 --> 00:40:59.50
But I couldn't recall any specific cases of a lack of discipline.

693
00:40:59.50 --> 00:41:03.50
If pot was being smoked, it was kept pretty quiet and infrequent.

694
00:41:03.50 --> 00:41:09.50
The crews in the unit were just their fantastic kids.

695
00:41:09.50 --> 00:41:14.50
The doorgunners, they most of those guys, in fact, I think just better than one of them was an

696
00:41:14.50 --> 00:41:18.50
infantry guy who volunteered to come and serve as a doorgunner.

697
00:41:18.50 --> 00:41:20.50
They were an essential part of the aircraft.

698
00:41:20.50 --> 00:41:24.50
Not only do they take care of the guns on the aircraft, they also assisted the crew chief and

699
00:41:24.50 --> 00:41:28.50
cleaning the aircraft and running the engine and stuff like that.

700
00:41:28.50 --> 00:41:34.50
The pilots, as I said, college dropouts, most of us, or the old guys, and the old guys,

701
00:41:34.50 --> 00:41:37.50
they were, we tried to give them the easy missions but they never took them.

702
00:41:37.50 --> 00:41:40.50
They stepped right up to the plate like everybody else.

703
00:41:40.50 --> 00:41:47.50
Fortunately, we only lost two or three guys in my time there that were married men.

704
00:41:47.50 --> 00:41:53.50
My roommate Dave Hannah, another two other guys that I knew real well that we lost.

705
00:41:53.50 --> 00:41:56.50
But both of them were married guys.

706
00:41:56.50 --> 00:42:02.50
The crew chiefs, all of those guys, they had enlisted four crew chief duty.

707
00:42:02.50 --> 00:42:08.50
And they had gone to the maintenance course and came back over really a great bunch of guys.

708
00:42:08.50 --> 00:42:11.50
I still keep in touch with several of them.

709
00:42:11.50 --> 00:42:16.50
Commissioned officers, the RLOs, the real live officers, as us warn officers refer to them.

710
00:42:16.50 --> 00:42:18.50
Most of them were pretty good guys.

711
00:42:18.50 --> 00:42:23.50
We have one or two that were less than stellar.

712
00:42:23.50 --> 00:42:24.50
Let me put it that way.

713
00:42:24.50 --> 00:42:27.50
But most of them were really, really pretty good.

714
00:42:27.50 --> 00:42:34.50
Our maintenance officer was fantastic and I still communicate with him quite frequently.

715
00:42:34.50 --> 00:42:37.50
The operations officer, he talked to him a lot.

716
00:42:37.50 --> 00:42:39.50
He was good.

717
00:42:39.50 --> 00:42:44.50
Even our previous operations officer who left the day I got there, Howard Burbank.

718
00:42:44.50 --> 00:42:48.50
He kind of heads up our reunions and everything's a great guy.

719
00:42:48.50 --> 00:42:52.50
So mostly officers were really fantastic and easy to work with.

720
00:42:52.50 --> 00:42:57.50
In the unit, aircraft commander didn't make a difference what your rank was.

721
00:42:57.50 --> 00:43:01.50
You had the earn to seek to be an aircraft commander.

722
00:43:01.50 --> 00:43:07.50
And it took four months of flying time and a vote of confidence by all of the existing aircraft commanders before you got that honor.

723
00:43:07.50 --> 00:43:11.50
Didn't make a difference if you were a war officer or if you were an RLO.

724
00:43:11.50 --> 00:43:14.50
If you didn't cut the mustard, you didn't get in the left seat.

725
00:43:14.50 --> 00:43:19.50
And they held that pretty steady through my entire time there and it was good.

726
00:43:19.50 --> 00:43:21.50
There was a lot of respect for aircraft commanders.

727
00:43:21.50 --> 00:43:23.50
Everybody understood how it worked.

728
00:43:23.50 --> 00:43:29.50
If you were an RLO, you're going to be in the right seat until you get voted to be in the left seat and it worked well.

729
00:43:29.50 --> 00:43:34.50
As you're kind of learning the ropes of what's going on there,

730
00:43:34.50 --> 00:43:38.50
you're talking to a guy's sergeant first class Robertson, like an ops guy.

731
00:43:38.50 --> 00:43:41.50
Guess you guys called him pops.

732
00:43:41.50 --> 00:43:42.50
Good man.

733
00:43:42.50 --> 00:43:44.50
He lays some stuff out for you.

734
00:43:44.50 --> 00:43:46.50
What are most of the missions that we fly?

735
00:43:46.50 --> 00:43:47.50
I asked sir.

736
00:43:47.50 --> 00:43:48.50
It's a bit of everything.

737
00:43:48.50 --> 00:43:51.50
You may start the day off flying ash and trash,

738
00:43:51.50 --> 00:43:59.50
Re-supply for a battalion followed by being part of a six to combat assault followed by flying night hunter killer or Chuck Chuck.

739
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:02.50
Chuck Chuck, I asked command and control of a battalion commander.

740
00:44:02.50 --> 00:44:04.50
We'll jump aboard with his staff.

741
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:11.50
We'll fly around the circle around the unit in contact while the battalion commander directs artillery fire.

742
00:44:11.50 --> 00:44:13.50
Boring is hell for you, generally.

743
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:14.50
What's a six to I asked?

744
00:44:14.50 --> 00:44:17.50
A six to is a flight of six, you is in two cobras.

745
00:44:17.50 --> 00:44:21.50
The cobras will come from our delta company on the other side of the chicken pen.

746
00:44:21.50 --> 00:44:23.50
They refer to their areas the snake pit.

747
00:44:23.50 --> 00:44:25.50
And hunter killer, that's a fun one.

748
00:44:25.50 --> 00:44:26.50
Three aircraft.

749
00:44:26.50 --> 00:44:28.50
A co-brew flying at about 1,000 feet.

750
00:44:28.50 --> 00:44:31.50
A hewie full of flares flying at about 1,000 feet.

751
00:44:31.50 --> 00:44:35.50
Following the cobras and a hewie flying between the ground and 500 feet.

752
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:39.50
Nice and slow with lights on, so Charlie can see you and shoot at you.

753
00:44:39.50 --> 00:44:51.50
The low bird is equipped with a 50 caliber machine gun replacing one of the M60 guns and a search light with a low angle with a low light intensity night vision scope on top is mounted in the cargo door.

754
00:44:51.50 --> 00:44:58.50
If the low bird sees something or get shot at the cobras rolls hot on it and the flare aircraft starts dropping flares of the cobras and sea targets.

755
00:44:58.50 --> 00:45:01.50
Once more coffee. Yes, please.

756
00:45:01.50 --> 00:45:05.50
How do you get, how do you get missions?

757
00:45:05.50 --> 00:45:11.50
During the night and generally before 200 hours the maintenance offshore will tell us how many birds we can put up for the next day.

758
00:45:11.50 --> 00:45:13.50
We pass that to battalion.

759
00:45:13.50 --> 00:45:17.50
Sometimes around 0,200 battalion starts sending the missions to us.

760
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:21.50
Captain Goodnight comes in about 0,400 in the signs the pilots and the missions.

761
00:45:21.50 --> 00:45:23.50
And we start waking everyone up.

762
00:45:23.50 --> 00:45:26.50
Generally we get the birds in the air at first light.

763
00:45:26.50 --> 00:45:32.50
Most of the birds aren't instrument rated so that can be a problem in the monsoon season which will begin in about three months.

764
00:45:32.50 --> 00:45:35.50
When do I get to fly? I know what you're thinking and that's good.

765
00:45:35.50 --> 00:45:41.50
But enjoy sitting on the ground for as long as you can, because once you're cleared you'll get all the flying you want and then some.

766
00:45:41.50 --> 00:45:44.50
Yeah, you did get all the flying you want to get some.

767
00:45:44.50 --> 00:45:50.50
That was one thing that was interesting to me and I guess I kind of knew it but not this clearly.

768
00:45:50.50 --> 00:45:57.50
You you you guys did everything you whether it was logistics runs whether it was supporting assaults you were doing everything you did everything.

769
00:45:57.50 --> 00:46:01.50
You did everything the only thing you didn't do is operate as a gunship because we weren't quick to be a gunship.

770
00:46:01.50 --> 00:46:05.50
There was aircrafts fishing for that but everything else and met a vac.

771
00:46:05.50 --> 00:46:12.50
It wasn't common for the slicks to fly met a vac missions unless it was really an emergency.

772
00:46:12.50 --> 00:46:17.50
And why is that? Well, we didn't we weren't equipped with medics or any medical supplies on board.

773
00:46:17.50 --> 00:46:23.50
We were a little first aid kits and that was about it. So they would try to get the medivac birds to come in and take care of them now.

774
00:46:23.50 --> 00:46:25.50
They had medivac birds and dust off.

775
00:46:25.50 --> 00:46:31.50
Dust off medivac birds were part of the first cavalry division and the hundred and first airborne division.

776
00:46:31.50 --> 00:46:33.50
They were equipped with guns.

777
00:46:33.50 --> 00:46:36.50
Had the big red cross on the side but they had guns on board.

778
00:46:36.50 --> 00:46:43.50
Dust off had the red cross on the side but they had no guns and they were part of the 44th medical brigade.

779
00:46:43.50 --> 00:46:47.50
So that was the difference between the two and people here at the term dust off from medivac, which one was a witch.

780
00:46:47.50 --> 00:46:49.50
Well, that was the difference between them.

781
00:46:49.50 --> 00:46:56.50
The only time I ever flew medivac is when I was actually supporting a ground unit with a log mission and they got hit at the same time.

782
00:46:56.50 --> 00:47:01.50
And I came back in and they threw on the bunch of guys that were wounded and I flew them out.

783
00:47:01.50 --> 00:47:04.50
But that was about it for a medivac mission.

784
00:47:04.50 --> 00:47:10.50
The missions we didn't like that medivac wouldn't fly is pulling the bodies out.

785
00:47:10.50 --> 00:47:13.50
That event wouldn't touch a body.

786
00:47:13.50 --> 00:47:15.50
We had to fly those out so we did those.

787
00:47:15.50 --> 00:47:17.50
Everything else we did it all.

788
00:47:17.50 --> 00:47:20.50
Re-supplies CNC, 900 Killer, 11900 Killer.

789
00:47:20.50 --> 00:47:22.50
I'd fly the low bird.

790
00:47:22.50 --> 00:47:25.50
I didn't want to fly that flare bird one bit.

791
00:47:25.50 --> 00:47:28.50
So is it the low bird the one that's the bait?

792
00:47:28.50 --> 00:47:29.50
Yeah.

793
00:47:29.50 --> 00:47:30.50
I like that one.

794
00:47:30.50 --> 00:47:33.50
The flare bird, he just orbits around up there.

795
00:47:33.50 --> 00:47:35.50
He's getting bored.

796
00:47:35.50 --> 00:47:41.50
And the bad thing is he's carrying 21 million power candles.

797
00:47:41.50 --> 00:47:44.50
Yeah, he's huge, huge flares.

798
00:47:44.50 --> 00:47:48.50
He takes the tracer around that bird's burning.

799
00:47:48.50 --> 00:47:54.50
And they, in fact, they carried them in 55 gallon drums out on the skids that were held on by straps so that they did take a round.

800
00:47:54.50 --> 00:47:59.50
They would take the machetes and cut those straps and drop and drop and drop all that stuff right away.

801
00:47:59.50 --> 00:48:01.50
So I never want to fly the flare bird.

802
00:48:01.50 --> 00:48:03.50
The low bird, I love flying the low bird.

803
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:04.50
That was fun.

804
00:48:04.50 --> 00:48:05.50
I was like, hey, bait.

805
00:48:05.50 --> 00:48:12.50
That's for a little bit.

806
00:48:12.50 --> 00:48:18.50
Sleep came quick and I drummed a pleasant thing as I hadn't been in country the long enough to have bad dreams.

807
00:48:18.50 --> 00:48:24.50
As I slumbered, I began to dream about the jet I heard coming in for landing on our air strip.

808
00:48:24.50 --> 00:48:27.50
It was getting louder and louder and holy shit.

809
00:48:27.50 --> 00:48:28.50
Jet's can't land here.

810
00:48:28.50 --> 00:48:31.50
I was on the floor of our tent with everyone else.

811
00:48:31.50 --> 00:48:38.50
When the rocket impacted behind our tent followed by a second impacting the VIP landing pad behind the majors tent.

812
00:48:38.50 --> 00:48:41.50
Incoming I heard as I grabbed my flack jacket and my helmet.

813
00:48:41.50 --> 00:48:44.50
I was half running half crawling to the bunker in my boxer shorts.

814
00:48:44.50 --> 00:48:53.50
When another rocket impacted with a flash spraying shrapnel, diving through the door, the bunker I piled into someone in total darkness of the bunker and got shoved to the other side.

815
00:48:53.50 --> 00:48:56.50
Hey, watch it man, someone said, anyone seeing the new guy?

816
00:48:56.50 --> 00:48:57.50
I recognized lose voice.

817
00:48:57.50 --> 00:48:58.50
Over here, Lou.

818
00:48:58.50 --> 00:48:59.50
I answered.

819
00:48:59.50 --> 00:49:02.50
This is your first rocket attack new guy he asked.

820
00:49:02.50 --> 00:49:04.50
Well, yeah, I've only been here for two days.

821
00:49:04.50 --> 00:49:05.50
Is this common I asked?

822
00:49:05.50 --> 00:49:06.50
Yep, almost nightly.

823
00:49:06.50 --> 00:49:09.50
And since this is your first, you get to buy the beer.

824
00:49:09.50 --> 00:49:13.50
You can't be sure the refrigerator stock tomorrow morning when we come back.

825
00:49:13.50 --> 00:49:20.50
And the darkness, the sounds of laughter could be heard over the sounds of impacting rockets and secondary explosions.

826
00:49:20.50 --> 00:49:24.50
Anytime you did something for the first time, you had a bio case of beer.

827
00:49:24.50 --> 00:49:26.50
And that was the cost of learning.

828
00:49:26.50 --> 00:49:30.50
So I bought a lot of beer just like everybody else those first couple of months.

829
00:49:30.50 --> 00:49:31.50
Yeah.

830
00:49:31.50 --> 00:49:35.50
Yeah, those 120 two rockets, they weren't accurate.

831
00:49:35.50 --> 00:49:40.50
But boy, they would sure wake you up and just, you know, create havoc for your evening.

832
00:49:40.50 --> 00:49:45.50
They were always trying to shoot at the runway or at the chicken coop snake pit area.

833
00:49:45.50 --> 00:49:49.50
And everyone's why we lost an aircraft to want it slam in there.

834
00:49:49.50 --> 00:49:53.50
The mortars, they were accurate.

835
00:49:53.50 --> 00:49:56.50
And we did not like getting the mortar rounds in.

836
00:49:56.50 --> 00:49:59.50
And you may bring it up later on.

837
00:49:59.50 --> 00:50:08.50
Yeah, the mortars, the barber, our barber was the one that was registering the mortar rounds on us.

838
00:50:08.50 --> 00:50:10.50
Well, case of beer.

839
00:50:10.50 --> 00:50:15.50
So yeah, that was, I don't know, I don't know when that, I don't know where that came from, but when I got the seal teams.

840
00:50:15.50 --> 00:50:16.50
Same thing.

841
00:50:16.50 --> 00:50:18.50
Oh, the first time jumping cool case of beer.

842
00:50:18.50 --> 00:50:20.50
Okay, first time doing a fast rope cool case of beer.

843
00:50:20.50 --> 00:50:24.50
First time what, you know, first time shooting an MP5, yep, okay, so beer.

844
00:50:24.50 --> 00:50:26.50
So they got their beer out of us.

845
00:50:26.50 --> 00:50:29.50
That's for sure.

846
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:39.50
In the air at last, now you're flying and you get the aircraft turned over to locate Dan, your turn.

847
00:50:39.50 --> 00:50:42.50
Oh, wow, it was Dan and Tony, nocturne, first name basis.

848
00:50:42.50 --> 00:50:44.50
I have the aircraft, Tony.

849
00:50:44.50 --> 00:50:48.50
You have the aircraft you responded indicating he recognized I had positive control of the aircraft.

850
00:50:48.50 --> 00:50:55.50
With my left hand on the collective right hand on the cyclic, my whole hand, I started coming up on the power.

851
00:50:55.50 --> 00:50:57.50
The aircraft broke ground.

852
00:50:57.50 --> 00:50:59.50
Oh, shit, scream the door going, I work on a die.

853
00:50:59.50 --> 00:51:03.50
Whale the crew chief as I was shooting my pants.

854
00:51:03.50 --> 00:51:07.50
All right, you two knock it off, Tony said to the crew, they were laughing their asses off.

855
00:51:07.50 --> 00:51:10.50
Oh, sure, can't we screw with the new guy?

856
00:51:10.50 --> 00:51:13.50
Yeah, they did that to me.

857
00:51:13.50 --> 00:51:15.50
Of course, they did it to every new guy, too.

858
00:51:15.50 --> 00:51:20.50
Like I said, the crew chiefs in in door gunners, there are a bunch of jokes.

859
00:51:20.50 --> 00:51:23.50
And if they could jerk you chain, they jerk you chain.

860
00:51:23.50 --> 00:51:25.50
All in good fun, no.

861
00:51:25.50 --> 00:51:29.50
So you talk about doing combat auto rotations.

862
00:51:29.50 --> 00:51:30.50
Loved it.

863
00:51:30.50 --> 00:51:35.50
So explain the auto rotation and then what gets different on the combat auto rotation.

864
00:51:35.50 --> 00:51:40.50
In flight school, they teach you how to do the standard Army issue auto rotation.

865
00:51:40.50 --> 00:51:46.50
2000 feet over the approach in the runway, chop the throttle, pull the nose back to a 60-not air speed,

866
00:51:46.50 --> 00:51:51.50
but the collective down completely, let the aircraft fall 75 feet in the ground.

867
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:54.50
You flare the aircraft and pop the collective.

868
00:51:54.50 --> 00:52:00.50
As a aircraft continues to settle, you level the skids and commitment the rest of the power to set it down on the ground.

869
00:52:00.50 --> 00:52:02.50
Just love doing auto rotations.

870
00:52:02.50 --> 00:52:06.50
So the purpose of an auto rotation is you have something wrong with the aircraft.

871
00:52:06.50 --> 00:52:11.50
The engine quits and you can land an aircraft.

872
00:52:11.50 --> 00:52:13.50
You can land a helicopter safely.

873
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:14.50
Sure.

874
00:52:14.50 --> 00:52:15.50
Yeah.

875
00:52:15.50 --> 00:52:18.50
It's basically the momentum of the helicopter blades.

876
00:52:18.50 --> 00:52:19.50
That's right.

877
00:52:19.50 --> 00:52:22.50
They're just spinning and they keep spinning because they've been spinning really fast.

878
00:52:22.50 --> 00:52:26.50
And then as you come down, does the air keep them spinning as you come down?

879
00:52:26.50 --> 00:52:27.50
Keep some spinning.

880
00:52:27.50 --> 00:52:33.50
When you execute that flare, you've got to pop that collective or you're going to get an overspeed on your rotor head.

881
00:52:33.50 --> 00:52:36.50
You pop the collective and that keeps from the rotor speed.

882
00:52:36.50 --> 00:52:40.50
You want to keep your rotor in the green at 6600 rpm.

883
00:52:40.50 --> 00:52:46.50
And you'll correction at 335 rpm, 345 rpm, engines at 66.

884
00:52:46.50 --> 00:52:51.50
So you keep it at 345 when you flare, you're going to go well above that 345.

885
00:52:51.50 --> 00:52:52.50
So you pop that collective.

886
00:52:52.50 --> 00:52:54.50
And then that lets you settle the aircraft down.

887
00:52:54.50 --> 00:52:59.50
And then when you get about four feet off the ground, you come in with the rest of it as you level the skids.

888
00:52:59.50 --> 00:53:00.50
Easy set down.

889
00:53:00.50 --> 00:53:02.50
You don't want to try to parachute out of a helicopter with no engine.

890
00:53:02.50 --> 00:53:05.50
You might get beat up on the blades.

891
00:53:05.50 --> 00:53:09.50
So, no, nobody wears a parachute to exit a helicopter in an emergency.

892
00:53:09.50 --> 00:53:12.50
A combat auto rotation.

893
00:53:12.50 --> 00:53:15.50
There's a thing in the book called The Dead Zone.

894
00:53:15.50 --> 00:53:17.50
And pilots have to know the dead zone.

895
00:53:17.50 --> 00:53:24.50
There's a certain area that if you don't have air speed and altitude, air speed or altitude, you're going to die.

896
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:27.50
You want to have air speed or you want to have altitude.

897
00:53:27.50 --> 00:53:29.50
If you can have both, you're better off.

898
00:53:29.50 --> 00:53:32.50
But you have to keep one of those two.

899
00:53:32.50 --> 00:53:39.50
The combat auto rotations, especially the low level one, you come in a tree top level at 90 knots air speed and chop the throttle right then.

900
00:53:39.50 --> 00:53:41.50
And just start your flare.

901
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:48.50
And just as the aircraft comes over, where you want to touch down, you keep the flare going, keep the flare going, keep the flare going,

902
00:53:48.50 --> 00:53:50.50
and pull the power in and set it down.

903
00:53:50.50 --> 00:53:52.50
I love doing low level loader rotations.

904
00:53:52.50 --> 00:53:54.50
There were so much fun.

905
00:53:54.50 --> 00:53:57.50
Then you get to the advanced stage.

906
00:53:57.50 --> 00:53:59.50
You do the 180 auto rotation.

907
00:53:59.50 --> 00:54:01.50
1000 feet, chop the throttle.

908
00:54:01.50 --> 00:54:05.50
Take the aircraft, turn it in a tight turn and come down.

909
00:54:05.50 --> 00:54:11.50
Or what I was taught, if I guy that was a test pilot at the Bell helicopter.

910
00:54:11.50 --> 00:54:13.50
1000 feet, chop the throttle.

911
00:54:13.50 --> 00:54:15.50
Zero the air speed.

912
00:54:15.50 --> 00:54:16.50
Do a pedal turn.

913
00:54:16.50 --> 00:54:18.50
Punch the nose straight to the ground.

914
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:21.50
Build up your rotor RPM and just do a normal touch down.

915
00:54:21.50 --> 00:54:26.50
And you can do that at 3602 and 360 save me one time.

916
00:54:26.50 --> 00:54:32.50
Are you, so look, like how many times when you when you start trying to do the combat auto rotation,

917
00:54:32.50 --> 00:54:36.50
how many times do you try this before you've got it?

918
00:54:36.50 --> 00:54:39.50
About three or four times.

919
00:54:39.50 --> 00:54:44.50
You do enough auto rotations in flight school that you've got the basics for an auto rotation down pat.

920
00:54:44.50 --> 00:54:49.50
And you go up with an experience pilot and they'll run you through a couple of times and you'll have no problem.

921
00:54:49.50 --> 00:54:55.50
Then again, too, once you become an AC, you can do auto rotations whenever you want.

922
00:54:55.50 --> 00:54:58.50
You don't have to worry about an instructor pilot sitting next to you.

923
00:54:58.50 --> 00:54:59.50
And we would do that.

924
00:54:59.50 --> 00:55:03.50
We would go out and when we're coming back at night after a mission, let's do an auto rotation.

925
00:55:03.50 --> 00:55:04.50
Let's go shoot some auto rotations.

926
00:55:04.50 --> 00:55:09.50
So you practice those things constantly when you're coming back in.

927
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:12.50
But now today, they don't even teach touch down auto rotations.

928
00:55:12.50 --> 00:55:13.50
I don't think.

929
00:55:13.50 --> 00:55:14.50
Why is that?

930
00:55:14.50 --> 00:55:16.50
I have no idea.

931
00:55:16.50 --> 00:55:18.50
What do you do if you lose power?

932
00:55:18.50 --> 00:55:24.50
I think they teach in the auto rotation, but they make them put the power in before they get to the ground and set it down.

933
00:55:24.50 --> 00:55:28.50
But I had heard that they don't teach touch downs anymore.

934
00:55:28.50 --> 00:55:30.50
They don't let them take them all the way to the ground.

935
00:55:30.50 --> 00:55:34.50
How much does a, how much does an HH60 cost?

936
00:55:34.50 --> 00:55:35.50
Oh God.

937
00:55:35.50 --> 00:55:38.50
How much is a Huey cost?

938
00:55:38.50 --> 00:55:39.50
A Huey right now.

939
00:55:39.50 --> 00:55:41.50
You can get by a Huey for about 500,000.

940
00:55:41.50 --> 00:55:42.50
What about a nom?

941
00:55:42.50 --> 00:55:43.50
Let me what about in this time period.

942
00:55:43.50 --> 00:55:46.50
On this time period, I think there are 250,000.

943
00:55:46.50 --> 00:55:48.50
And what's your best guess on a black off?

944
00:55:48.50 --> 00:55:52.50
Probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 8 or 900,000.

945
00:55:52.50 --> 00:55:54.50
That's just a guess.

946
00:55:54.50 --> 00:55:56.50
I don't know if that's way cheaper than I thought.

947
00:55:56.50 --> 00:55:58.50
I'm going to have to check that one out.

948
00:55:58.50 --> 00:56:00.50
Yeah, I'm not sure.

949
00:56:00.50 --> 00:56:01.50
Roger.

950
00:56:01.50 --> 00:56:05.50
Seems like the Huey was way, way, way cheaper.

951
00:56:05.50 --> 00:56:06.50
Oh, it is.

952
00:56:06.50 --> 00:56:09.50
There's nothing sophisticated about Huey.

953
00:56:09.50 --> 00:56:12.50
I mean, engine was simple.

954
00:56:12.50 --> 00:56:14.50
The L13 engine, a great engine.

955
00:56:14.50 --> 00:56:20.50
But nothing, no complicated computer electronics in it.

956
00:56:20.50 --> 00:56:22.50
You had to just standard flight instruments.

957
00:56:22.50 --> 00:56:25.50
And none of it was computerized, no computer chips.

958
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:29.50
Very simple aircraft to work on, and a simple aircraft to fly.

959
00:56:29.50 --> 00:56:31.50
And it was an amazing aircraft to fly.

960
00:56:31.50 --> 00:56:36.50
It would take so many hits that, and it still keep going.

961
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:41.50
The biggest I saw was a friend of mine, Al Hess, Bill Hess.

962
00:56:41.50 --> 00:56:45.50
He got hit and I covered it in one of the books.

963
00:56:45.50 --> 00:56:47.50
I forget which one it's covered in.

964
00:56:47.50 --> 00:56:49.50
He had 107 bullet holes.

965
00:56:49.50 --> 00:56:54.50
And his aircraft, one of which was a 50 caliber round that went through the frame.

966
00:56:54.50 --> 00:56:56.50
Right above the pilots head.

967
00:56:56.50 --> 00:56:59.50
In fact, one of our Canadian lieutenants.

968
00:56:59.50 --> 00:57:03.50
He had gotten shot in the groin, and it leaned forward.

969
00:57:03.50 --> 00:57:07.50
And when he did that 50 caliber round hit the the post.

970
00:57:07.50 --> 00:57:10.50
And if he hadn't a lean forward, he would have hit him in the head.

971
00:57:10.50 --> 00:57:13.50
But yeah, but he had 107 rounds in that aircraft.

972
00:57:13.50 --> 00:57:15.50
And the aircraft still flew.

973
00:57:15.50 --> 00:57:20.50
Another thing that you do over there is the combat takeoff.

974
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:22.50
Yes, so what's the combat takeoff all about?

975
00:57:22.50 --> 00:57:27.50
Nice flight school type helicopter takeoff is you come to a three foot hover.

976
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:32.50
You pull your power, you drop your nose, and you climb out of the nice rate of climb.

977
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:35.50
Combat helicopter takeoff.

978
00:57:35.50 --> 00:57:39.50
You pull that power in, and you shove that nose over at the same time.

979
00:57:39.50 --> 00:57:43.50
And so you're coming out of there like a bat at a hill.

980
00:57:43.50 --> 00:57:47.50
It's no this three foot hover stabilizing and then go, it is pushed.

981
00:57:47.50 --> 00:57:51.50
Roll the nose over, give it full power and get out of there as quickly as you can.

982
00:57:51.50 --> 00:57:57.50
And the first couple times you do it for a new guy, it scares you because you think you're going to hit the rotor blades on the ground.

983
00:57:57.50 --> 00:57:59.50
You roll it over so far.

984
00:57:59.50 --> 00:58:02.50
But how much clearance do you have?

985
00:58:02.50 --> 00:58:04.50
Oh, you got your front rotor blades.

986
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:05.50
Six or seven feet.

987
00:58:05.50 --> 00:58:06.50
Easy.

988
00:58:06.50 --> 00:58:07.50
No factor.

989
00:58:07.50 --> 00:58:08.50
Yeah, it's no factor.

990
00:58:08.50 --> 00:58:09.50
Yeah.

991
00:58:09.50 --> 00:58:11.50
But when you're sitting there, you're normally looking at, you know,

992
00:58:11.50 --> 00:58:15.50
it's sitting up there 15 feet and then all of a sudden it's six feet off the ground.

993
00:58:15.50 --> 00:58:19.50
You go, oh, hell, scared the crap out of you.

994
00:58:19.50 --> 00:58:24.50
You say you're getting advised Dan, don't fly without a map.

995
00:58:24.50 --> 00:58:26.50
And know where you are at all times on that map.

996
00:58:26.50 --> 00:58:29.50
If you go down, you're going to have a lot of time to figure that out.

997
00:58:29.50 --> 00:58:32.50
This is another cool thing is you guys were just doing land now the whole time.

998
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:33.50
Yes.

999
00:58:33.50 --> 00:58:36.50
You're not, you're not looking at any kind of instrument to know where you are.

1000
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:38.50
I mean, I guess I'll do the compass.

1001
00:58:38.50 --> 00:58:42.50
You had a DB and DB non-directional beacon.

1002
00:58:42.50 --> 00:58:44.50
There was one in Tane in.

1003
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:46.50
We had one at Lyke.

1004
00:58:46.50 --> 00:58:49.50
And I believe there was one up at Song Bay.

1005
00:58:49.50 --> 00:58:54.50
And if you had to do an instrument approach, you're going to do an NDB approach or a GCA approach.

1006
00:58:54.50 --> 00:58:55.50
But that was it.

1007
00:58:55.50 --> 00:59:00.50
So you really need to know where you were at at all times and have a good idea where you were.

1008
00:59:00.50 --> 00:59:07.50
Were you, were you flying in a small enough area that you got to know everything?

1009
00:59:07.50 --> 00:59:08.50
Yes.

1010
00:59:08.50 --> 00:59:09.50
Really easily.

1011
00:59:09.50 --> 00:59:15.50
From Lyke up to Tane in was probably 80, 90 miles from Tane in across along the board.

1012
00:59:15.50 --> 00:59:17.50
It was probably another 100 miles.

1013
00:59:17.50 --> 00:59:19.50
And then back down to Lyke was probably another 80 miles.

1014
00:59:19.50 --> 00:59:21.50
So that was about the area you were working in.

1015
00:59:21.50 --> 00:59:23.50
So you had a bunch of geographical references there.

1016
00:59:23.50 --> 00:59:24.50
There's that road.

1017
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:25.50
There's that mountain.

1018
00:59:25.50 --> 00:59:26.50
There's that whatever.

1019
00:59:26.50 --> 00:59:27.50
There's the river.

1020
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:28.50
There's bridge.

1021
00:59:28.50 --> 00:59:30.50
In fact, the funny thing was three core of the area.

1022
00:59:30.50 --> 00:59:31.50
We flew.

1023
00:59:31.50 --> 00:59:33.50
It was pretty flat.

1024
00:59:33.50 --> 00:59:35.50
The vegetation wise.

1025
00:59:35.50 --> 00:59:40.50
But at Tane in, there was a mountain there that looked like an extinct volcano.

1026
00:59:40.50 --> 00:59:41.50
It wasn't.

1027
00:59:41.50 --> 00:59:43.50
But it's just this big tits sticking up.

1028
00:59:43.50 --> 00:59:45.50
And it's song Bay was another one sitting there.

1029
00:59:45.50 --> 00:59:49.50
So if you could see those two, you knew exactly where you were at.

1030
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:51.50
And then there's thunder road that went up the middle.

1031
00:59:51.50 --> 00:59:58.50
So you had a pretty good idea where you read it all times.

1032
00:59:58.50 --> 00:59:59.50
You're on a mission.

1033
00:59:59.50 --> 01:00:01.50
You're out there fast forward a little bit.

1034
01:00:01.50 --> 01:00:02.50
You're still learning.

1035
01:00:02.50 --> 01:00:06.50
You made a pass over the intended landing point, Mr. Leak went into education mode.

1036
01:00:06.50 --> 01:00:08.50
Okay, this smoke tells us almost no wind.

1037
01:00:08.50 --> 01:00:10.50
So that's not going to be a factor.

1038
01:00:10.50 --> 01:00:12.50
The trees on the south side look lower than the north side.

1039
01:00:12.50 --> 01:00:14.50
The units on the south side as well.

1040
01:00:14.50 --> 01:00:16.50
So we'll make final approach over the south side.

1041
01:00:16.50 --> 01:00:21.50
Never make your approach the same twice in a row if you can help it.

1042
01:00:21.50 --> 01:00:24.50
Always make the approach from a different angle each time.

1043
01:00:24.50 --> 01:00:26.50
Turning into final at the last minute if you can.

1044
01:00:26.50 --> 01:00:28.50
You make the approach.

1045
01:00:28.50 --> 01:00:30.50
You make the approach the same each time.

1046
01:00:30.50 --> 01:00:33.50
And Charlie will fire your ass up.

1047
01:00:33.50 --> 01:00:35.50
Got it. Got it.

1048
01:00:35.50 --> 01:00:36.50
Yes.

1049
01:00:36.50 --> 01:00:39.50
The, the big LZs.

1050
01:00:39.50 --> 01:00:42.50
You had a lot of options where it came critical.

1051
01:00:42.50 --> 01:00:46.50
Was when you got into a smaller LZ or a hoverhold that you're going to have to

1052
01:00:46.50 --> 01:00:47.50
Re-supply at.

1053
01:00:47.50 --> 01:00:50.50
If you came in the same way three times in a row.

1054
01:00:50.50 --> 01:00:52.50
Charlie is probably going to smoke in the third time.

1055
01:00:52.50 --> 01:00:55.50
You always tried to come in a different way a different angle.

1056
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:58.50
You had to keep mind where it's the lowest approach path I can use.

1057
01:00:58.50 --> 01:01:00.50
Especially if you had a heavy aircraft.

1058
01:01:00.50 --> 01:01:01.50
Where's the wind blowing?

1059
01:01:01.50 --> 01:01:04.50
I want to come into the wind and I want to come in and

1060
01:01:04.50 --> 01:01:05.50
I'll lowest path.

1061
01:01:05.50 --> 01:01:09.50
So a lot of times that was dictate that maybe the final turn would be the same.

1062
01:01:09.50 --> 01:01:11.50
But you want to come in from the left side.

1063
01:01:11.50 --> 01:01:13.50
You want to come in from the right side.

1064
01:01:13.50 --> 01:01:16.50
If you could you come in from into the, you come in with the wind and then do a

1065
01:01:16.50 --> 01:01:17.50
Pedal term.

1066
01:01:17.50 --> 01:01:18.50
Although that's seldom very happened.

1067
01:01:18.50 --> 01:01:23.50
So you just did not want to map the same approach the same path every time.

1068
01:01:23.50 --> 01:01:27.50
When I was home on leave after my year there.

1069
01:01:27.50 --> 01:01:33.50
Somebody was using my aircraft went into a hover hole the same way three times.

1070
01:01:33.50 --> 01:01:35.50
And the third time Charlie got him.

1071
01:01:35.50 --> 01:01:39.50
And we lost the aircraft, lost the crew and lost everybody on board.

1072
01:01:39.50 --> 01:01:43.50
You know what's as you mentioned the weight of the aircraft.

1073
01:01:43.50 --> 01:01:46.50
Well, one thing that I really got an appreciation for.

1074
01:01:46.50 --> 01:01:50.50
And I noticed that when I would get out of helicopters.

1075
01:01:50.50 --> 01:01:53.50
You could see you know the helicopter would move a little bit depending on what kind of

1076
01:01:53.50 --> 01:01:57.50
helicopter it was. But you know when you drive a car.

1077
01:01:57.50 --> 01:02:02.50
If you put 500 pounds, I mean if you put 200 300 400 pounds into a car you don't really

1078
01:02:02.50 --> 01:02:06.50
Notice it. You have to put a lot of weight into a car before you notice it.

1079
01:02:06.50 --> 01:02:08.50
It takes a little longer to break.

1080
01:02:08.50 --> 01:02:11.50
You know, maybe if you throw a bunch of you know,

1081
01:02:11.50 --> 01:02:16.50
2000 pounds of bricks into the back of your pickup truck, you notice that.

1082
01:02:16.50 --> 01:02:20.50
But the he who you guys could notice the weight, you know,

1083
01:02:20.50 --> 01:02:24.50
300 400 pounds is is a lot different and you have to be.

1084
01:02:24.50 --> 01:02:28.50
It's like you guys were so attuned to those aircraft.

1085
01:02:28.50 --> 01:02:32.50
The the weight and balance, you know, if we were at a hover and

1086
01:02:32.50 --> 01:02:35.50
300 pounds off to one side, you're going to notice that.

1087
01:02:35.50 --> 01:02:38.50
You noticed it, especially if guys started jumping out of the aircraft,

1088
01:02:38.50 --> 01:02:40.50
you'd notice the rocking in it.

1089
01:02:40.50 --> 01:02:43.50
A lot of times going into an LZ for the first time on a resupply,

1090
01:02:43.50 --> 01:02:46.50
I would try to take 30 water cans.

1091
01:02:46.50 --> 01:02:50.50
That gave me a good size load for that trip.

1092
01:02:50.50 --> 01:02:54.50
It also gave me a load light enough that I could see how the aircraft was handling

1093
01:02:54.50 --> 01:02:56.50
based on the wind conditions and the approach.

1094
01:02:56.50 --> 01:03:00.50
There was one time I got no NLD, I only had 10 water cans on.

1095
01:03:00.50 --> 01:03:02.50
That's how bad that hoverhole was.

1096
01:03:02.50 --> 01:03:04.50
But most of the time 30 water cans was good.

1097
01:03:04.50 --> 01:03:06.50
Then you know, you're going back the second time.

1098
01:03:06.50 --> 01:03:10.50
If I could take more than 30 water cans and smamble, we throw that on as well.

1099
01:03:10.50 --> 01:03:14.50
But you always had to be careful and the crew chief was really the guy responsible for this.

1100
01:03:14.50 --> 01:03:18.50
Watching where the weight and balance was at, making sure that they put too much weight

1101
01:03:18.50 --> 01:03:23.50
up forward to the pilots, keep trying to keep it all back, back centre around the transmission

1102
01:03:23.50 --> 01:03:26.50
well in the centre of the aircraft.

1103
01:03:26.50 --> 01:03:35.50
Another little section here, sort of about what life was like over there for you guys.

1104
01:03:35.50 --> 01:03:40.50
It was obvious that the rear echelon lived a lot better than those closest to the front action.

1105
01:03:40.50 --> 01:03:43.50
We lived good as aviators certainly much better than the grunts.

1106
01:03:43.50 --> 01:03:48.50
But these rear echelon mothers, rymphs, as we called them, were living the life.

1107
01:03:48.50 --> 01:03:54.50
There was always had been and always would be some animosity between those on the front lines

1108
01:03:54.50 --> 01:03:56.50
and those in the rear.

1109
01:03:56.50 --> 01:04:00.50
Those in the rear areas enjoyed levels of comfort only imagined by those on the front.

1110
01:04:00.50 --> 01:04:05.50
Clean sheets, hot chow, good boots, and movies were just some of the perks.

1111
01:04:05.50 --> 01:04:11.50
Besides never getting shot at and all the while bitching how tough they had it because of the paper cuts they received.

1112
01:04:11.50 --> 01:04:16.50
History shows general Eisenhower wanted Paris to be an R&R centre for the front line troops.

1113
01:04:16.50 --> 01:04:24.50
Just after it was liberated, 150,000 rymphs took up residence and he could do nothing to dislodge them.

1114
01:04:24.50 --> 01:04:25.50
Some things never changed.

1115
01:04:25.50 --> 01:04:28.50
And they still haven't changed to this day.

1116
01:04:28.50 --> 01:04:33.50
During desert storm, I was out there with my battalion and we were in jungle boots.

1117
01:04:33.50 --> 01:04:38.50
We used a superglue to close the holes up on the side to keep the sand out.

1118
01:04:38.50 --> 01:04:44.50
And it got to the point where we were using duct tape to hold the boots together because they were just getting torn apart in the flint.

1119
01:04:44.50 --> 01:04:49.50
And up shows some rymphs from the back end and they've all got brand new desert boots.

1120
01:04:49.50 --> 01:04:51.50
We never got desert boots the whole time we were there.

1121
01:04:51.50 --> 01:04:53.50
We were front line infantry.

1122
01:04:53.50 --> 01:04:55.50
So it hasn't changed and it never will change.

1123
01:04:55.50 --> 01:04:57.50
You're always going to have that argument.

1124
01:04:57.50 --> 01:05:02.50
A perfect example is you look at the movie, what glory.

1125
01:05:02.50 --> 01:05:06.50
About the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.

1126
01:05:06.50 --> 01:05:08.50
And what was their big complaint boots?

1127
01:05:08.50 --> 01:05:09.50
It hasn't changed.

1128
01:05:09.50 --> 01:05:12.50
We're still arguing about boots in the military.

1129
01:05:12.50 --> 01:05:15.50
I have a leadership consulting company.

1130
01:05:15.50 --> 01:05:20.50
The name of the leadership consulting company is echelon front.

1131
01:05:20.50 --> 01:05:24.50
And there's a very specific reason why we have that because we want to be well-known.

1132
01:05:24.50 --> 01:05:28.50
Like where it's talking about what leadership is like from the front.

1133
01:05:28.50 --> 01:05:29.50
Yes, the front lines.

1134
01:05:29.50 --> 01:05:32.50
Not what it's like in the rear with the gear.

1135
01:05:32.50 --> 01:05:33.50
That's right.

1136
01:05:33.50 --> 01:05:36.50
Well, we used to say nothing's too good for the infantry.

1137
01:05:36.50 --> 01:05:38.50
So the infantry gets nothing.

1138
01:05:38.50 --> 01:05:43.50
Check.

1139
01:05:43.50 --> 01:05:47.50
Next section's called Reality Sets in.

1140
01:05:47.50 --> 01:05:49.50
That evening, this is fast forwarding.

1141
01:05:49.50 --> 01:05:52.50
That evening we were in our tent discussing that day's activities.

1142
01:05:52.50 --> 01:05:56.50
The assistant maintenance officer came in looking for a beer.

1143
01:05:56.50 --> 01:05:57.50
Hey, John, how's it going?

1144
01:05:57.50 --> 01:05:59.50
I asked, give me a beer and I'll tell you how it's going.

1145
01:05:59.50 --> 01:06:02.50
One of the other pilots opened their refrigerator and handed him a cold one.

1146
01:06:02.50 --> 01:06:06.50
We have 13 of our 21 aircrafts shot to shit.

1147
01:06:06.50 --> 01:06:08.50
Two have got to be evacuated back to the states.

1148
01:06:08.50 --> 01:06:12.50
They're shot up so bad, 251 and 228 of the remaining 11.

1149
01:06:12.50 --> 01:06:17.50
We have an estimated 3,000 hours of work ahead of us to get them into flying condition.

1150
01:06:17.50 --> 01:06:24.50
Tomorrow we'll have a total of six aircraft that we can put into the air as I already had two in for periodic inspections.

1151
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:29.50
The first of those shot up today will be up the day after tomorrow.

1152
01:06:29.50 --> 01:06:34.50
And that's seven 40 as I only need 24 hours of maintenance to solve that one.

1153
01:06:34.50 --> 01:06:38.50
I can tell you that maintenance platoon is not going to get any sleep for a few days.

1154
01:06:38.50 --> 01:06:41.50
I silently thank God I wasn't a maintenance officer.

1155
01:06:41.50 --> 01:06:47.50
Again, just point out that the teamwork that it took to keep these birds flying was immense.

1156
01:06:47.50 --> 01:06:49.50
It meant steam work to keep them up.

1157
01:06:49.50 --> 01:06:57.50
It was incumbent upon the pilots to make sure that we weren't messing the aircraft up with tree strikes on rotoblades or tail rotostrikes on on on bushes.

1158
01:06:57.50 --> 01:07:00.50
That was a bad factor that happened.

1159
01:07:00.50 --> 01:07:01.50
Not paying attention.

1160
01:07:01.50 --> 01:07:06.50
You've been in the skids on a stump or on a log or you punch a hole in the bottom of the aircraft on a stump.

1161
01:07:06.50 --> 01:07:08.50
So it was incumbent upon the flight crews.

1162
01:07:08.50 --> 01:07:14.50
First of all, make sure you don't screw the aircraft up because the maintenance guys when we got in situations.

1163
01:07:14.50 --> 01:07:19.50
They had more than enough work to keep them busy.

1164
01:07:19.50 --> 01:07:21.50
Another kind of interesting thing here.

1165
01:07:21.50 --> 01:07:25.50
At this time we had no standardized markings on the noses of our aircraft.

1166
01:07:25.50 --> 01:07:29.50
The pilots' doors had a green triangle with a lightning bolt through the triangle but that was all.

1167
01:07:29.50 --> 01:07:35.50
Across the nose of each, the aircraft commanders and crews generally put their individual pet name on the nose.

1168
01:07:35.50 --> 01:07:41.50
Iron butterfly, green lantern, devils advocate and hard luck to name a few.

1169
01:07:41.50 --> 01:07:48.50
We had some really good, we had a really good nose art artist, Sergeant Skowell who was kept busy.

1170
01:07:48.50 --> 01:07:54.50
Some units had a bit more discipline and a standard emblem on the noses of the aircraft, which you guys eventually got the chicken.

1171
01:07:54.50 --> 01:08:02.50
We eventually got the chicken. Mike Skowell, he is now a famous artist in South West America.

1172
01:08:02.50 --> 01:08:04.50
He's out there and he still does a great artwork.

1173
01:08:04.50 --> 01:08:07.50
I've got a couple of his pieces and he keeps busy with that.

1174
01:08:07.50 --> 01:08:13.50
But at that time our unit had an assortment of nose art and it's got changed.

1175
01:08:13.50 --> 01:08:21.50
There's a great book that a guy named John Brennan just published his second one and it's nose art of aircraft.

1176
01:08:21.50 --> 01:08:26.50
And it covers all a lot of units that had nose art on them, both of my birds are in there.

1177
01:08:26.50 --> 01:08:28.50
What'd you have on your birds?

1178
01:08:28.50 --> 01:08:31.50
Well the first one had the chicken and then it had a hard luck.

1179
01:08:31.50 --> 01:08:36.50
So what was that, what was the nose art for hard luck?

1180
01:08:36.50 --> 01:08:41.50
It was the calf patch with the chicken in the middle of it and then hard luck with across the top.

1181
01:08:41.50 --> 01:08:43.50
I'll send you a picture of it.

1182
01:08:43.50 --> 01:08:45.50
That's awesome.

1183
01:08:45.50 --> 01:08:51.50
This is another interesting thing and this is, this is, I was going to bring this up earlier.

1184
01:08:51.50 --> 01:08:56.50
So you're talking about why it's so important to have confidence in the aircraft commander.

1185
01:08:56.50 --> 01:09:01.50
As Lou is bringing us into position as chalk six he asked how much formation time do you have.

1186
01:09:01.50 --> 01:09:06.50
Just when we got in flight school in a couple hours the other day I replied without looking in his direction.

1187
01:09:06.50 --> 01:09:09.50
Don't tell me this is your first combat assault.

1188
01:09:09.50 --> 01:09:11.50
Okay, I won't but it is.

1189
01:09:11.50 --> 01:09:13.50
Oh, I see it's going to be a long day.

1190
01:09:13.50 --> 01:09:17.50
He took a breath. Okay, formation flying here isn't like flight school.

1191
01:09:17.50 --> 01:09:23.50
He said as he moved closer to the right side of chalk five in mother rocker, which is where you guys go to flight school.

1192
01:09:23.50 --> 01:09:27.50
And mother rocker, they wanted two rotor blade widths between aircraft.

1193
01:09:27.50 --> 01:09:32.50
Here we fly at one to one half rotor from the other.

1194
01:09:32.50 --> 01:09:37.50
He was going for the half rotor distance and my pocket factor was starting to suck the seat up my ass.

1195
01:09:37.50 --> 01:09:39.50
I looked back at chalk seven.

1196
01:09:39.50 --> 01:09:42.50
Oh shit, he's going for half rotor distance as well.

1197
01:09:42.50 --> 01:09:52.50
Lou is calmly smoking his cigarette and continuing to lecture while he held the cyclic sicklic in his hand index and middle fingers.

1198
01:09:52.50 --> 01:09:55.50
The one thing you don't want to do is overrap rotor blades.

1199
01:09:55.50 --> 01:09:57.50
Oh, trust me that ain't happened.

1200
01:09:57.50 --> 01:09:59.50
Okay, you got it. He said, I responded.

1201
01:09:59.50 --> 01:10:00.50
I got it.

1202
01:10:00.50 --> 01:10:05.50
And I wish I hadn't immediately we started sliding back to a two rotor blade distance.

1203
01:10:05.50 --> 01:10:12.50
Chalk seven called us. Hey, chalk six did the new guy just take it great. Now the entire formation knew I added.

1204
01:10:12.50 --> 01:10:14.50
Yeah, and he's shitting in his pants.

1205
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:17.50
Now that wasn't true, but it wasn't far from the truth.

1206
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:20.50
Okay, let's close it back up and get with the formation.

1207
01:10:20.50 --> 01:10:22.50
I pulled in some more power and ease that aircraft forward.

1208
01:10:22.50 --> 01:10:24.50
Good. Now just hold it there.

1209
01:10:24.50 --> 01:10:26.50
Lou said and I immediately started drifting back.

1210
01:10:26.50 --> 01:10:28.50
No, get back up there.

1211
01:10:28.50 --> 01:10:31.50
Yeah, formation flying to be truthful.

1212
01:10:31.50 --> 01:10:33.50
I didn't like formation flying.

1213
01:10:33.50 --> 01:10:35.50
I didn't like it in flight school.

1214
01:10:35.50 --> 01:10:37.50
I don't even like reading about it.

1215
01:10:37.50 --> 01:10:38.50
I wanted to be.

1216
01:10:38.50 --> 01:10:42.50
I really wanted to be a dust off pilot because dust off pilots didn't fly formation.

1217
01:10:42.50 --> 01:10:43.50
So that made me happy.

1218
01:10:43.50 --> 01:10:45.50
And then they said, no, you're going to a lift.

1219
01:10:45.50 --> 01:10:46.50
Oh, hell.

1220
01:10:46.50 --> 01:10:47.50
I'm going to have to learn how to fly formations.

1221
01:10:47.50 --> 01:10:48.50
I hate formations.

1222
01:10:48.50 --> 01:10:52.50
So it was not easy for me to get in there with Lou and fly formations.

1223
01:10:52.50 --> 01:10:57.50
But he is such a good pilot and such a good and common structure.

1224
01:10:57.50 --> 01:11:01.50
And it made him because he usually drank a six pack in the morning before he got in the aircraft.

1225
01:11:01.50 --> 01:11:04.50
I don't know. But anyway, he was really good.

1226
01:11:04.50 --> 01:11:09.50
And really set me to ease and probably after about five hours.

1227
01:11:09.50 --> 01:11:13.50
I could get in there and be comfortable flying at one road to blade out.

1228
01:11:13.50 --> 01:11:18.50
And then the book I go through about how he taught me about how to get judge your distance,

1229
01:11:18.50 --> 01:11:22.50
how to judge where you're going to be, how to keep yourself out of trouble in LZs and stuff.

1230
01:11:22.50 --> 01:11:24.50
Really a really a good pilot.

1231
01:11:24.50 --> 01:11:27.50
Yeah, that half road to blade.

1232
01:11:27.50 --> 01:11:30.50
That's scared to live in the Jesus out of me.

1233
01:11:30.50 --> 01:11:35.50
You have a section here, fast forward a little bit.

1234
01:11:35.50 --> 01:11:37.50
You're talking about it.

1235
01:11:37.50 --> 01:11:42.50
It's a good conversation as you know, I tend to bring things back to leadership and there's a good conversation.

1236
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:45.50
You have about leadership in here.

1237
01:11:45.50 --> 01:11:49.50
And it starts when you're talking about the current company commander that you had at this time.

1238
01:11:49.50 --> 01:11:50.50
Yeah.

1239
01:11:50.50 --> 01:11:54.50
And the question is, have you ever seen him in the cockpit or on the flight line or out of his tent?

1240
01:11:54.50 --> 01:11:56.50
When you do, please let us know.

1241
01:11:56.50 --> 01:11:59.50
It'll be a first said Mr. Toliver.

1242
01:11:59.50 --> 01:12:02.50
The other second at that comment, how come I asked?

1243
01:12:02.50 --> 01:12:05.50
The CEO is on his third tour over here.

1244
01:12:05.50 --> 01:12:10.50
His first was as an advisor in the early 60s and his second was in 65 as an aviator.

1245
01:12:10.50 --> 01:12:15.50
Pretty rough assignment. He took a couple hits in the aircraft and on his body.

1246
01:12:15.50 --> 01:12:21.50
He's paid his dues. He only has another couple of months in command and then they'll probably move up to batallion or brigade staff.

1247
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:24.50
He's all right. He just doesn't care to fly anymore.

1248
01:12:24.50 --> 01:12:26.50
Responded, Mr. Toliver.

1249
01:12:26.50 --> 01:12:31.50
Well, what makes a good flight leader I asked as I opened another beer for myself and others.

1250
01:12:31.50 --> 01:12:39.50
Mr. Reynolds field that fielded that question. He had been in the unit for about seven months and was considering extending but not for our unit.

1251
01:12:39.50 --> 01:12:41.50
No one seemed to do that.

1252
01:12:41.50 --> 01:12:47.50
Extending your tour was a rare occasion in Vietnam even in those units that appeared to have high morale and good leadership.

1253
01:12:47.50 --> 01:12:51.50
A good flight leader must be a good pilot.

1254
01:12:51.50 --> 01:12:53.50
Must first be a good pilot and no his aircraft.

1255
01:12:53.50 --> 01:13:00.50
No what its limitations are and how far he can stretch them. He must be a good aircraft commander taking care of his aircraft and his crew.

1256
01:13:00.50 --> 01:13:05.50
Just because we're officers doesn't mean we can't help the crew take care of the aircraft.

1257
01:13:05.50 --> 01:13:07.50
Did you notice when Captain Bullock landed?

1258
01:13:07.50 --> 01:13:15.50
The first thing he did was leave the aircraft to his crew and beat feet to the club for a beer instead of stay behind and help them sweep it out and post flight it?

1259
01:13:15.50 --> 01:13:20.50
No. He left that to has says co-pilot for today and the crew.

1260
01:13:20.50 --> 01:13:26.50
Self-centered bastard. Just because he's an RLO he thinks he's too good to get his hands dirty.

1261
01:13:26.50 --> 01:13:29.50
Do you think he helped Phil Sandbags to build the bunker?

1262
01:13:29.50 --> 01:13:32.50
Not him or any of the RLLs for that matter.

1263
01:13:32.50 --> 01:13:38.50
James and stood there that day and supervised while everyone else did the digging and stacking.

1264
01:13:38.50 --> 01:13:42.50
Okay Reynolds that's enough venting, interjected Mr. Toliver.

1265
01:13:42.50 --> 01:13:48.50
Besides being a good pilot and aircraft commander a flight leader must plan, coordinate and anticipate the mission.

1266
01:13:48.50 --> 01:13:53.50
Once he gets his brief from the ground commander he needs to do a recon flight over the LZ or PZ.

1267
01:13:53.50 --> 01:14:01.50
He needs to judge how many aircraft will fit in and what formation will work so we're not doing last minute dick dance like we did today.

1268
01:14:01.50 --> 01:14:05.50
Bullock never did a recon and that's why we were dick dancing in the kill zone.

1269
01:14:05.50 --> 01:14:13.50
Once he's done his recon he needs to coordinate with the ground commander on what formation will be so they can plan accordingly.

1270
01:14:13.50 --> 01:14:20.50
He needs to coordinate with the attack helicopter's if it's going to be an insertion. He needs to coordinate with the aircraft commanders and let us know what's what.

1271
01:14:20.50 --> 01:14:24.50
And he needs to anticipate what all can go wrong and have a plan for that as well.

1272
01:14:24.50 --> 01:14:31.50
Be an aircraft breaking down before the mission or ground fire on the LZ or PZ.

1273
01:14:31.50 --> 01:14:33.50
Yes.

1274
01:14:33.50 --> 01:14:46.50
The aircraft commander and leadership was so important. I found out recently that the commander that we had before the current commander talked about in there was worse than the current company commander.

1275
01:14:46.50 --> 01:14:54.50
And the current company commander he just was not interested in being the company commander or exercising leadership.

1276
01:14:54.50 --> 01:15:00.50
Leadership in the unit was from the RLOs. It was from our operations officer and one of the butoon leaders.

1277
01:15:00.50 --> 01:15:07.50
I mentioned in there did not exercise leadership and very seldom you ever see him exercise leadership.

1278
01:15:07.50 --> 01:15:12.50
And it was pretty much up to the operations officer and this one other butoon leader that that really took things by the horn.

1279
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:17.50
They were the flight leaders and really guided us pretty much.

1280
01:15:17.50 --> 01:15:20.50
That's one of the reasons nobody ever read re-up for the unit.

1281
01:15:20.50 --> 01:15:26.50
The more on the unit wasn't that good at the time. It was it was good with the horn officers and the crew chiefs and stuff.

1282
01:15:26.50 --> 01:15:31.50
But as far as a unit cohesion goes it was lacking.

1283
01:15:31.50 --> 01:15:36.50
The you mentioned something in there about the flight leaders.

1284
01:15:36.50 --> 01:15:39.50
If you had a flight leader that was screwed up.

1285
01:15:39.50 --> 01:15:42.50
Everybody's lives were going to be in trouble.

1286
01:15:42.50 --> 01:15:48.50
And on this one mission there that bullet was the flight leader. We got a bunch of aircraft shot up. That was March 6.

1287
01:15:48.50 --> 01:15:52.50
And I think we went in with something like seven aircraft.

1288
01:15:52.50 --> 01:15:57.50
One broke down before we got there. The other six went in and the LZ had to go in two, two and two.

1289
01:15:57.50 --> 01:16:00.50
And the NVA were sitting there waiting for us.

1290
01:16:00.50 --> 01:16:03.50
If we ran in against NVA we were going to be a trouble.

1291
01:16:03.50 --> 01:16:06.50
VC didn't worry about them. They couldn't shoot for shit.

1292
01:16:06.50 --> 01:16:10.50
But they couldn't hit their they're asked with both hands.

1293
01:16:10.50 --> 01:16:13.50
But the NVA knew how to shoot it. They helicopter and they did a good job of shooting.

1294
01:16:13.50 --> 01:16:18.50
But the leadership was important and it just was lacking when I first got there.

1295
01:16:18.50 --> 01:16:22.50
Yeah, that scenario that I skipped over.

1296
01:16:22.50 --> 01:16:28.50
It's real obvious when you look at it you're thinking, okay, how long is going to take us to put two birds at a time.

1297
01:16:28.50 --> 01:16:32.50
Multiple lifts in a row before the enemy goes, okay, well we'll wait for them.

1298
01:16:32.50 --> 01:16:34.50
We'll head them next time they come in here.

1299
01:16:34.50 --> 01:16:37.50
Yeah, that a lot of times they'd let you in on the first lift.

1300
01:16:37.50 --> 01:16:43.50
And then the second lift that's when they'd open up on you or the third lift.

1301
01:16:43.50 --> 01:16:49.50
Usually if it was an extraction you could expect the third lift coming out to take fire.

1302
01:16:49.50 --> 01:16:56.50
Last position you want it was number six in a six ship lift coming out of a two ship LZ because you're going to catch every bit of it.

1303
01:16:56.50 --> 01:16:57.50
They're just waiting for you.

1304
01:16:57.50 --> 01:17:02.50
And if they could knock an aircraft down then what happens is they've got it.

1305
01:17:02.50 --> 01:17:04.50
Oh, there's a wrench thrown in everything.

1306
01:17:04.50 --> 01:17:07.50
Everybody's got to come back in. You got to pile on.

1307
01:17:07.50 --> 01:17:10.50
And you better have a plan ready for it.

1308
01:17:10.50 --> 01:17:13.50
There's a crew good going to get killed.

1309
01:17:13.50 --> 01:17:18.50
And even you're talking about the contingency of hey, one of our aircraft might go down before we even take off.

1310
01:17:18.50 --> 01:17:18.50
That's right.

1311
01:17:18.50 --> 01:17:21.50
Maintenance problem if you don't have some kind of contingency.

1312
01:17:21.50 --> 01:17:28.50
And that's another thing that we'll get into, but the idea, so you have the aircraft commander who's obviously in charge of their singular aircraft.

1313
01:17:28.50 --> 01:17:33.50
But then you've got the flight lead that's leading the whole operation that's in charge of it overall.

1314
01:17:33.50 --> 01:17:37.50
And that's the person that has to account for all these different things.

1315
01:17:37.50 --> 01:17:38.50
That's right.

1316
01:17:38.50 --> 01:17:45.50
And we go out the flight leader. We go out about an hour before everybody else and get the coordination with the ground commander done the artillery, etc.

1317
01:17:45.50 --> 01:17:47.50
Go out and do his recon of the LZ.

1318
01:17:47.50 --> 01:17:49.50
Make sure you do what formation was going to finish.

1319
01:17:49.50 --> 01:17:54.50
Make sure the ground commander knew what formation he need to have his troops in to pick up.

1320
01:17:54.50 --> 01:17:59.50
And he knew what formation you were going to drop them off because that would make a difference in his ground assault plan.

1321
01:17:59.50 --> 01:18:01.50
So all that coordination had to get done.

1322
01:18:01.50 --> 01:18:05.50
You had to have a flight leader that was on his toes to do that kind of stuff.

1323
01:18:05.50 --> 01:18:10.50
Initially when I got there, only the artillery else could be flight leaders.

1324
01:18:10.50 --> 01:18:12.50
Warn officers.

1325
01:18:12.50 --> 01:18:15.50
We were technical officers, not tactical officers.

1326
01:18:15.50 --> 01:18:20.50
So, Warn officers weren't allowed to be flight leaders when I first got there.

1327
01:18:20.50 --> 01:18:25.50
Here's a mission that we hadn't talked about yet.

1328
01:18:25.50 --> 01:18:29.50
What's a sniffer mission I asked?

1329
01:18:29.50 --> 01:18:35.50
This machine picks up ammonia which bodies give off in this heat in the form of first operation.

1330
01:18:35.50 --> 01:18:44.50
When the machine gives off a reading of max, the operator will call out max mark, which means he has a large group giving off a lot of first operation.

1331
01:18:44.50 --> 01:18:46.50
And we should engage.

1332
01:18:46.50 --> 01:18:52.50
Problem first problem is not only do humans give off ammonia, but so do monkeys.

1333
01:18:52.50 --> 01:18:54.50
So we'll probably be shooting a lot of monkeys.

1334
01:18:54.50 --> 01:19:00.50
The second problem is in order for this to work, we'll be flying at tree top level at 60 knots.

1335
01:19:00.50 --> 01:19:09.50
The two co-bris from L.O.B. will be 1,000 feet and following us and we'll engage if we call for fire or our taking fire.

1336
01:19:09.50 --> 01:19:11.50
Bob and formed me.

1337
01:19:11.50 --> 01:19:12.50
You're shooting me, right?

1338
01:19:12.50 --> 01:19:15.50
We're going to fly at tree top at only 60 knots.

1339
01:19:15.50 --> 01:19:18.50
I shit you not, Bob said with a grin.

1340
01:19:18.50 --> 01:19:20.50
So that's an interesting one.

1341
01:19:20.50 --> 01:19:23.50
Yeah, the sniffer missions were very interesting.

1342
01:19:23.50 --> 01:19:31.50
The first time I took a hit near craft, we were flying along and the guy ran out max mark and about that time I claimed more and the top of the tree went off.

1343
01:19:31.50 --> 01:19:35.50
And like a shotgun blast hit the front of the aircraft.

1344
01:19:35.50 --> 01:19:40.50
But I am sure that more monkeys died than NVA from the sniffer missions.

1345
01:19:40.50 --> 01:19:41.50
Stay the truth.

1346
01:19:41.50 --> 01:19:44.50
It was.

1347
01:19:44.50 --> 01:19:48.50
Now here's something that you mentioned before.

1348
01:19:48.50 --> 01:19:49.50
Fast forward a little bit.

1349
01:19:49.50 --> 01:19:54.50
Mike and I walked back to the aircraft and saw that I had a light load of ammo.

1350
01:19:54.50 --> 01:20:00.50
Morning missions usually meant picking up empty water and mermaids cans from the night before and taking ammo in for the day ahead.

1351
01:20:00.50 --> 01:20:05.50
As we started the aircraft, they've asked, have you done any hoverholes yet?

1352
01:20:05.50 --> 01:20:11.50
Just around Long Bean, which I understand isn't much compared to this area I replied.

1353
01:20:11.50 --> 01:20:16.50
He says back, you're about to experience the scariest thing about flying in Vietnam.

1354
01:20:16.50 --> 01:20:17.50
Yes.

1355
01:20:17.50 --> 01:20:18.50
Yes.

1356
01:20:18.50 --> 01:20:21.50
So talk to us about talk to us about hoverholes.

1357
01:20:21.50 --> 01:20:22.50
Ever holds.

1358
01:20:22.50 --> 01:20:26.50
Long Bean, the vegetation around Long Bean was the biggest trees are only about 30 feet.

1359
01:20:26.50 --> 01:20:30.50
Well scattered out, yet some brush and stuff like that.

1360
01:20:30.50 --> 01:20:32.50
So it was pretty open to rain.

1361
01:20:32.50 --> 01:20:34.50
You could find a Nell Z pretty easily.

1362
01:20:34.50 --> 01:20:35.50
Nothing to it.

1363
01:20:35.50 --> 01:20:40.50
Up along the Cambodian border, Song Bay region that we flew in a great deal.

1364
01:20:40.50 --> 01:20:42.50
There it was different.

1365
01:20:42.50 --> 01:20:44.50
There it was triple canopy jungle.

1366
01:20:44.50 --> 01:20:47.50
The trees are about 300 feet high.

1367
01:20:47.50 --> 01:20:48.50
And it was packed.

1368
01:20:48.50 --> 01:20:50.50
There was no LZs.

1369
01:20:50.50 --> 01:20:56.50
To get an LZ, you either had a bomb crater from an air strike or they were bringing a daisy cutter.

1370
01:20:56.50 --> 01:21:00.50
In 15,000 pound bomb that had chains welded around the outside of the casing.

1371
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:03.50
They dropped it from the sea, went 30 on a parachute.

1372
01:21:03.50 --> 01:21:05.50
And it had a probe on the end of it.

1373
01:21:05.50 --> 01:21:07.50
And it would come down when it'd probe hit the ground that thing would go off.

1374
01:21:07.50 --> 01:21:10.50
And it would make a nice one ship helicopter LZ.

1375
01:21:10.50 --> 01:21:13.50
It would clean out every tree, every stump, everything.

1376
01:21:13.50 --> 01:21:14.50
Just beautiful.

1377
01:21:14.50 --> 01:21:20.50
But most of the time you didn't get that, you got the bomb crater from a B-52 strike to go down it.

1378
01:21:20.50 --> 01:21:22.50
And so when you come in at that thing, here you are.

1379
01:21:22.50 --> 01:21:23.50
You got a load on board.

1380
01:21:23.50 --> 01:21:25.50
30 water cans.

1381
01:21:25.50 --> 01:21:27.50
You come in and I think you're looking for the wind.

1382
01:21:27.50 --> 01:21:30.50
You want to land into the wind, turn into the wind.

1383
01:21:30.50 --> 01:21:31.50
And you start down.

1384
01:21:31.50 --> 01:21:35.50
You're at a hover and you're hovering down 300 feet.

1385
01:21:35.50 --> 01:21:37.50
The eyes in the back are the crew chief and door gunner.

1386
01:21:37.50 --> 01:21:39.50
And they're telling you, bring your tail right.

1387
01:21:39.50 --> 01:21:41.50
Bring your tail left.

1388
01:21:41.50 --> 01:21:42.50
Drop down.

1389
01:21:42.50 --> 01:21:44.50
Stop. Come right.

1390
01:21:44.50 --> 01:21:45.50
Come left.

1391
01:21:45.50 --> 01:21:47.50
Start down.

1392
01:21:47.50 --> 01:21:48.50
Stop.

1393
01:21:48.50 --> 01:21:49.50
Move your tail to the left.

1394
01:21:49.50 --> 01:21:54.50
And you worked your way down through those trees to get to the bottom at home.

1395
01:21:54.50 --> 01:21:57.50
There were times I would look up through the greenhouse window.

1396
01:21:57.50 --> 01:21:59.50
And I couldn't see the sky.

1397
01:21:59.50 --> 01:22:00.50
These kids would wander.

1398
01:22:00.50 --> 01:22:01.50
Make us come down.

1399
01:22:01.50 --> 01:22:02.50
We'd slide around.

1400
01:22:02.50 --> 01:22:03.50
Drop down a month.

1401
01:22:03.50 --> 01:22:04.50
And then the tree limb.

1402
01:22:04.50 --> 01:22:05.50
Slide back down.

1403
01:22:05.50 --> 01:22:06.50
And then they'd tree limb.

1404
01:22:06.50 --> 01:22:07.50
And start back down.

1405
01:22:07.50 --> 01:22:08.50
Turn the tail boom.

1406
01:22:08.50 --> 01:22:09.50
Slide down some more.

1407
01:22:09.50 --> 01:22:11.50
And it takes all the eyes.

1408
01:22:11.50 --> 01:22:12.50
One of them is Mike Krowls 8.

1409
01:22:12.50 --> 01:22:13.50
I9 altered that aircraft.

1410
01:22:13.50 --> 01:22:15.50
To bring that aircraft down into those holes.

1411
01:22:15.50 --> 01:22:18.50
Are you working with the same aircraft the time?

1412
01:22:18.50 --> 01:22:19.50
Yes.

1413
01:22:19.50 --> 01:22:23.50
Well, they only the only person that it wasn't the same would be the right seat pilot.

1414
01:22:23.50 --> 01:22:25.50
Aircraft commanders flew less seat.

1415
01:22:25.50 --> 01:22:28.50
We rotated new guys through through the aircraft commanders.

1416
01:22:28.50 --> 01:22:31.50
To be me, my crew chief my door gunner'd be always the same.

1417
01:22:31.50 --> 01:22:33.50
And that's the full loadout.

1418
01:22:33.50 --> 01:22:34.50
happi.

1419
01:22:34.50 --> 01:22:35.50
My door gunner.

1420
01:22:35.50 --> 01:22:36.50
That's the full loadout.

1421
01:22:36.50 --> 01:22:38.50
Cool pilot.

1422
01:22:38.50 --> 01:22:40.50
Pilate Cargonone crew chief.

1423
01:22:40.50 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah.

1424
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.18
So you know exactly when this guy says left a little bit. You know what that means. Yeah, in fact

1425
01:22:47.18 --> 01:22:49.18
They would have to say

1426
01:22:49.68 --> 01:22:51.18
Mr. Jackson

1427
01:22:51.18 --> 01:22:53.18
Come left your other left

1428
01:22:54.02 --> 01:22:56.02
So I

1429
01:22:56.02 --> 01:22:58.02
Screw up. Oh, okay. How do you know?

1430
01:23:00.72 --> 01:23:03.22
Yeah, that sounds freaking scary

1431
01:23:03.22 --> 01:23:09.68
Um, you're having some some chat and Captain Bullock

1432
01:23:10.08 --> 01:23:16.30
What's Captain Bullock's position? He was one of the two leaders. Okay, so he's one of the two leaders and he's got he's doing some introductions

1433
01:23:16.50 --> 01:23:23.000
He says this is Lieutenant weed. He said indicating the new pilot Lieutenant weed was tall and Lanky with long blonde hair

1434
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.08
Reminding me of a California surfer which he claimed he was during his introduction

1435
01:23:27.08 --> 01:23:30.56
We didn't pay much attention until someone asked him for his first name

1436
01:23:31.06 --> 01:23:32.76
Richard was his response

1437
01:23:32.76 --> 01:23:36.56
Luka didn't let that one go looking at the four of us. He said

1438
01:23:36.84 --> 01:23:40.44
Probably loud enough to be heard by the group Lieutenant dick weed

1439
01:23:41.80 --> 01:23:47.10
We couldn't keep it in all three of us were in hysterics. Luminating to straight face standing up and turning to Lieutenant dick

1440
01:23:47.10 --> 01:23:51.62
We'd do introduce himself. Welcome sir on blue price heading back to the states in a month

1441
01:23:51.96 --> 01:23:57.78
He said and left the mess hall lieutenant dick weed was in Vietnam on his first tour and he would prove to be a cocky guy

1442
01:23:57.78 --> 01:24:04.30
If he wasn't in charge of something he tried to make himself in charge and a one more than one occasion was put in his place by a flight

1443
01:24:04.50 --> 01:24:09.02
Leader or an aircraft commander he arrived the unit before I made aircraft commander

1444
01:24:09.02 --> 01:24:14.74
So I was fortunate enough never have to fly with him. Yeah, he was one of those lieutenant's that the thought because he was a lieutenant

1445
01:24:14.74 --> 01:24:16.74
He would be in charge of the aircraft

1446
01:24:16.74 --> 01:24:23.18
It it took him a while to realize that no you don't get to be in charge of the aircraft until you're voted charge of the aircraft

1447
01:24:23.18 --> 01:24:26.98
So we had many many times with lieutenant dick weed

1448
01:24:29.14 --> 01:24:34.20
The night the night hunter killer missions you already you already kind of briefed what those were and

1449
01:24:35.02 --> 01:24:38.30
That you prefer to be the bait. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'd much rather be the bait

1450
01:24:39.50 --> 01:24:43.54
They were they were good missions a lot of times. She flew them down the rivers

1451
01:24:44.66 --> 01:24:50.38
So you'd be flying along and and one of the reasons you liked it because you knew if you had an engine failure

1452
01:24:50.38 --> 01:24:54.86
You'd be better off going into the river than you would in the jungle. So we always flew it right

1453
01:24:54.86 --> 01:24:56.86
Just right along the edge of the tree line there

1454
01:24:57.90 --> 01:24:59.90
But you'd fly long it was interesting

1455
01:25:00.22 --> 01:25:05.10
You were looking for something you weren't just born a hole in the sky like the the cobra and the flair ship or

1456
01:25:06.02 --> 01:25:11.02
You had the same crew all the time usually the guys that were on the search light and the star light scope

1457
01:25:11.02 --> 01:25:16.02
That was usually somebody from the supply room or one of the kids at a maintenance that wanted to go out and do some

1458
01:25:16.02 --> 01:25:19.22
The besides is normal job. So they would jump up and volunteer for that

1459
01:25:19.22 --> 01:25:23.90
The 900 killer mission that crew got that mission from month

1460
01:25:24.30 --> 01:25:28.94
So when everybody else was out flying in the daytime, we'd be sleeping and when they came back in

1461
01:25:28.94 --> 01:25:30.22
That's when we were going back out

1462
01:25:30.22 --> 01:25:35.34
So you got to work with the usually the same units and you got to know the the brigade staff at the you know

1463
01:25:35.34 --> 01:25:37.18
Second brigade in the areas that you're working

1464
01:25:37.18 --> 01:25:44.18
You got a good relationship with them that that carried over once you were back on day shift with these guys did you feel

1465
01:25:45.50 --> 01:25:47.50
like

1466
01:25:47.50 --> 01:25:53.14
safer because you're flying at night and it's hard to see how look after a night or was a little bit a little bit

1467
01:25:53.14 --> 01:25:55.86
But then again, too, you know you know you know you're out there trying to get shot at

1468
01:25:57.82 --> 01:26:02.82
We flew with the dopile estores open off took those off the aircraft what why is that?

1469
01:26:03.58 --> 01:26:07.14
Because each one of the pilots we carry a nm79 grenade launch on his lap

1470
01:26:07.14 --> 01:26:11.26
And we'd fired out the door if we needed to so and

1471
01:26:11.26 --> 01:26:17.46
And it was just kind of nice to be able to look out there couldn't fly at the doors off during the day for some reason, but

1472
01:26:18.38 --> 01:26:23.74
We like flying in at night like that so and and go an example there you talked about three times

1473
01:26:23.74 --> 01:26:29.46
Same up there so you got the 50 cal on the back you got what a cobra gun ship as well with all their munitions

1474
01:26:29.46 --> 01:26:32.06
But you guys had to make sure you had those m79

1475
01:26:32.06 --> 01:26:37.18
That's right. We had a 50 on one side of 60 on the other and the two m79s and the laps

1476
01:26:37.18 --> 01:26:45.66
The one time we got in trouble and it was one of the cases where we almost flew the mission three times the same way

1477
01:26:46.66 --> 01:26:50.40
We were coming back we'd we'd flown twice up in song bay on the river

1478
01:26:51.70 --> 01:26:56.38
So at the first night one way flew at the second night the same way the third night

1479
01:26:56.86 --> 01:26:58.86
thought it's changed up

1480
01:26:58.86 --> 01:27:01.50
So we came around and we flew at the opposite direction

1481
01:27:02.26 --> 01:27:04.26
We're coming down and

1482
01:27:04.26 --> 01:27:08.42
The cobra starts screaming at me you're taking fire and

1483
01:27:09.06 --> 01:27:12.78
My crew chief he looked behind us and he said yes, we're taking 51 fire from my honest

1484
01:27:12.78 --> 01:27:15.94
You could tell it's 51 because it looks like a flaming basketball

1485
01:27:16.66 --> 01:27:18.66
Come on up at you and

1486
01:27:19.22 --> 01:27:23.38
The cobra starts to roll hot and another 51 opens up in front of me and

1487
01:27:24.18 --> 01:27:28.58
Then a third 51 opened up on the other side of the river and with that's the way they would do it

1488
01:27:28.58 --> 01:27:33.22
They'd set up three 50 ones and try to catch you in the middle of the cone and they were set up perfect

1489
01:27:33.22 --> 01:27:37.30
If I've been coming from the other direction I'd have been right caught between two of them easily

1490
01:27:37.58 --> 01:27:41.70
But as it was one gun was out of position the flare ship dropped his flare

1491
01:27:41.70 --> 01:27:46.78
And then we spotted all three of them and the cobra went to work and my crew chief which was our company commander at that time

1492
01:27:47.38 --> 01:27:49.06
flying his first night hundred mission

1493
01:27:49.38 --> 01:27:52.42
He was on the phone calling the artillery up so day

1494
01:27:53.38 --> 01:27:54.74
the next day

1495
01:27:54.98 --> 01:27:59.42
They went out and found what the results were and and then the mission went to another unit

1496
01:27:59.42 --> 01:28:00.42
I

1497
01:28:00.42 --> 01:28:01.92
warned them about that

1498
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:03.92
They did the same thing I did and

1499
01:28:04.80 --> 01:28:09.84
The third day they got fire and they were ready with the artillery and the next day

1500
01:28:09.84 --> 01:28:13.04
They went out and picked up please to ball three guns and about 21 bodies, so

1501
01:28:14.64 --> 01:28:19.44
Are you getting shot at the 51 cows that is that green tracer coming at you?

1502
01:28:19.44 --> 01:28:24.56
Yes, so that's the weird thing and I've talked about this with some other guys and be it that we're in Vietnam is

1503
01:28:25.28 --> 01:28:26.48
For us

1504
01:28:26.48 --> 01:28:31.12
Everyone has red tracer now. Yeah, so you just it's crit. It's it's not the different

1505
01:28:31.12 --> 01:28:34.86
We don't have that distinguishing characteristic of green tracer

1506
01:28:34.86 --> 01:28:38.24
Tracer is they look like flaming basketballs at night and daytime

1507
01:28:38.24 --> 01:28:40.14
It looked like a bit you know flaming

1508
01:28:40.14 --> 01:28:45.60
Hardball at night that was a basketball coming up. You just oh my god. There was no doubt in your mind

1509
01:28:45.60 --> 01:28:47.60
But we're shooting at you

1510
01:28:51.64 --> 01:28:58.74
Little leadership here major Anthony, so you get a new a new company commander major Anthony now the new company commander

1511
01:28:58.74 --> 01:29:03.42
Justored they're looking over us and we at him no one said anything until he finally told us to take our seats

1512
01:29:03.82 --> 01:29:09.26
He then went on to give us his philosophy on command and how he expected the unit to operate

1513
01:29:09.58 --> 01:29:14.54
an hour an hour later in the club some discussions took place about what had been said

1514
01:29:15.30 --> 01:29:20.94
Mike said Dan what did you get out of the major speech? I'm running wondering if I heard wrong

1515
01:29:21.66 --> 01:29:27.58
What I heard was don't do anything that's going to jeopardize my success in command and we'll get along fine

1516
01:29:27.58 --> 01:29:32.70
Do so and I'll be unmerciful upon you. Yeah, I heard that to Mr. Hester Greed

1517
01:29:32.70 --> 01:29:37.78
I continued you know I've seen commanders like this when I was a kid with some of my dad's

1518
01:29:37.78 --> 01:29:42.74
Skippers having a command is a is a mandatory is mandatory for a successful career

1519
01:29:42.94 --> 01:29:49.38
Especially the higher up you go however managing and leading that command effectively and efficiently is what's important

1520
01:29:49.74 --> 01:29:54.58
Some officers view it as a threat if their subordinates do anything that would reflect badly on them

1521
01:29:54.58 --> 01:30:00.70
Major Anthony strikes me as that type will just have to wait and see I guess and he did not prove us wrong

1522
01:30:02.86 --> 01:30:08.26
He was really afraid that we were gonna ruin his career and and his last comments when he finally gave up command was

1523
01:30:08.26 --> 01:30:14.50
Well, I don't have you guys to ruin my career anymore, so I never saw him fly a mission a combat mission

1524
01:30:15.58 --> 01:30:20.02
He'd fly the action trash going down a side gone to the PX and stuff like that

1525
01:30:20.62 --> 01:30:22.62
He moved his tent

1526
01:30:22.62 --> 01:30:28.000
Because we're living in tents at that time he moved his tent out to the flight line and he was sitting there in a chair and

1527
01:30:28.50 --> 01:30:33.14
When you was time for you to launch hey check your times off if you launched late

1528
01:30:33.14 --> 01:30:35.30
You're gonna hear about it that night when you got back in

1529
01:30:35.74 --> 01:30:44.50
But he was very very much fearful of his career and I'm sure that his career puppy ended disastrously form I hope

1530
01:30:45.38 --> 01:30:46.98
On April 16th

1531
01:30:46.98 --> 01:30:55.38
1969 I was flying with Mr. Driscoe returning from a long day in Kwon, Lloyd I said it right yep and Kwon, Lloyd area flying

1532
01:30:55.54 --> 01:30:57.54
Re-supply of

1533
01:30:57.54 --> 01:31:04.78
One of the infantry battalions it was late in the afternoon the sun was setting we were monitoring the four radios when we heard the Mayday call

1534
01:31:05.58 --> 01:31:08.70
Mayday Mayday, Lobo one three is going down

1535
01:31:09.34 --> 01:31:15.90
Mr. Driscoe a cobra just went to the bamboo at three o'clock set our crew chief specialist Grossman

1536
01:31:15.90 --> 01:31:17.90
Lobo one three got off

1537
01:31:18.66 --> 01:31:24.42
One call before he plowed into the bamboo he was in a dive on a gun run and pulled out to late

1538
01:31:24.42 --> 01:31:29.54
Only being able to get the nose of the aircraft up but not enough to stop his downward motion

1539
01:31:30.06 --> 01:31:34.86
He crashed into ten foot high bamboo and put the aircraft over on its side

1540
01:31:35.26 --> 01:31:43.02
He was on top of an NVA bunker complex quickly Mr. Driscoe took controls for me and told me to plot our location and get out in

1541
01:31:43.02 --> 01:31:50.06
Additional Mayday call which I did alerting everyone where we were while I did that Mr. Driscoe made an approach into a small clearing

1542
01:31:50.06 --> 01:31:55.86
He'd spotted close to the down-dear craft and landed. It was just big enough for us to fit into the first thing

1543
01:31:55.86 --> 01:32:00.06
I noticed was the NVA bunker opening not ten feet from my door

1544
01:32:00.06 --> 01:32:06.14
I drew my 38 caliber pistol and pointed at the opening expecting someone to open fire at any moment

1545
01:32:06.14 --> 01:32:12.54
The down crew is struggling to get the miniguns off the front of the cobra when they began taking small arms fire

1546
01:32:12.54 --> 01:32:16.74
Specialist Grossman opened with the M60 machine gun shooting at nothing specific

1547
01:32:16.74 --> 01:32:23.54
But in the direction of the enemy fire as did specialist Leonard our door gunner. I cocked my 38 in weighted as

1548
01:32:23.82 --> 01:32:27.18
Soon as the down pilots got the miniguns off the down cobra

1549
01:32:27.18 --> 01:32:34.82
They ran to our aircraft and Mr. Driscoe pulled power to get us out of there as both gunners were firing and I emptied my 38 at the bamboo

1550
01:32:35.34 --> 01:32:39.82
worthless weapon the down pilots thanked us profusely for saving their butts as

1551
01:32:39.82 --> 01:32:46.90
They occupied the other side of the chicken pen their CEO came over that night and bought drinks for us at his club

1552
01:32:46.90 --> 01:32:51.30
Since we no longer had one he invited major Anthony who declined to drink with us

1553
01:32:51.30 --> 01:32:54.58
But made sure we didn't fly the next day a few months later

1554
01:32:54.58 --> 01:33:02.74
I came in from my flight and lying on my bed were orders for an air metal with V the down to air crew had put in our crew for the award

1555
01:33:03.02 --> 01:33:05.18
There was nothing our CEO could do about it

1556
01:33:05.18 --> 01:33:12.66
But instead of presenting the awards to us in front of the entire company he simply put them on our beds or at least had the orderly room clerk do it

1557
01:33:12.98 --> 01:33:20.70
He did that as well for the crew chief and the door gunners awards the man held grudges his last words to anyone when he departed the unit after six months

1558
01:33:20.70 --> 01:33:26.34
Was something to the effect of he wouldn't have us around the ruin his career. I think he may have done that on his own so

1559
01:33:27.34 --> 01:33:29.34
His late his later-shame style

1560
01:33:30.86 --> 01:33:33.10
When he first got there that first night

1561
01:33:33.10 --> 01:33:41.46
And I put this in the book he came into the club which was our we had a big GP medium tense where our club was that and he came in and

1562
01:33:42.38 --> 01:33:45.56
He asked he says how many who's flying them are?

1563
01:33:45.94 --> 01:33:50.82
Well bunch of the guys raised the hand he sent gentleman no drinking 24 hours for you fly and

1564
01:33:51.94 --> 01:33:53.94
And everybody's gone wait a minute

1565
01:33:54.82 --> 01:33:58.30
But we fly every day and and that was his point

1566
01:33:58.30 --> 01:34:05.58
Army of policy was you would not drink 24 hours for you fly or smoke within 50 feet of the aircraft well warn officer does it

1567
01:34:05.58 --> 01:34:11.30
Make you didn't smoke 24 hours for you flew or drink within 50 feet of the aircraft but but he didn't go along with that

1568
01:34:11.74 --> 01:34:13.98
So he shut the club down and

1569
01:34:14.86 --> 01:34:20.26
That way there he could say if somebody crashed he could say hey, it's my policy

1570
01:34:20.26 --> 01:34:25.06
They violated my policy because they drank the night before so they couldn't blame him. That's where he was

1571
01:34:25.06 --> 01:34:33.26
Well the the copper company commander he'd fight us over so we went over there our company commander wouldn't go he made sure we didn't fly the next day

1572
01:34:33.82 --> 01:34:35.18
but

1573
01:34:35.18 --> 01:34:38.18
But yeah, it's just the way that man was

1574
01:34:38.62 --> 01:34:46.62
Okay, well, I'm glad that you had a horrible leader, but damn going into that LZ landing on top of an NVA bunker complex grabbing those guys

1575
01:34:46.62 --> 01:34:48.02
It was been mayhem

1576
01:34:48.02 --> 01:34:54.82
Well, you had no choice. You don't leave somebody behind and that's kind of one of our models was you don't leave people behind

1577
01:34:54.82 --> 01:34:56.82
You saw the cover go down

1578
01:34:57.30 --> 01:35:03.58
We didn't know it was a bunker complex to we got on the ground there with them and I look over and I see this opening there

1579
01:35:03.58 --> 01:35:07.74
And I've got this worthless pistol that you couldn't hit a thing with and

1580
01:35:08.42 --> 01:35:13.14
But that's what you do and we did that many times over is that you're going to someplace it

1581
01:35:13.50 --> 01:35:16.22
Because you had a crew down you go and you get the crew out

1582
01:35:16.82 --> 01:35:20.26
Your aircraft taking the hits on that one. No, we didn't take any hits on that one

1583
01:35:21.70 --> 01:35:24.30
No, that's just what you're doing

1584
01:35:24.30 --> 01:35:26.86
No time to think about it. No no time to think about it

1585
01:35:29.18 --> 01:35:31.90
If you thought about it you would have never become a helicopter pilot

1586
01:35:33.46 --> 01:35:36.78
You know I had a bad guy by the name a Dean lad who is a

1587
01:35:37.78 --> 01:35:40.26
Marine Corps officer in World War II and

1588
01:35:40.98 --> 01:35:47.86
He was going into Taroa who and he'd already been into a couple other islands. I mean he was a he just

1589
01:35:49.10 --> 01:35:51.94
Combat combat combat now he's going into Taroa and

1590
01:35:51.94 --> 01:35:55.30
You know there's shelling in there's machine gun fire and

1591
01:35:56.34 --> 01:35:58.34
I asked him I said so when you are getting out

1592
01:35:58.70 --> 01:36:02.38
This is as they realize at Taroa, you know, they hit the coral reefs now

1593
01:36:02.38 --> 01:36:05.74
They got a walk 800 yards and there's freaking Japanese machine gun fire coming

1594
01:36:05.74 --> 01:36:09.14
I said we you know when you when you realize you're going to have to walk where you think and

1595
01:36:09.70 --> 01:36:11.54
I might get shot or whatever

1596
01:36:11.54 --> 01:36:16.58
He's like now that wouldn't happen to me. No, we'll happen to somebody else and that's pretty much what everybody

1597
01:36:16.58 --> 01:36:21.18
Everybody says like it might happen and he ended up getting shot. You know getting God shot and somehow survived

1598
01:36:21.18 --> 01:36:25.86
But the attitude of like well look it's going to be dangerous for other people

1599
01:36:25.86 --> 01:36:30.50
But not for me. I think I think the helicopter potts for a large extent had that same attitude

1600
01:36:30.50 --> 01:36:32.70
You know as hey we hate seeing aircraft go down

1601
01:36:32.70 --> 01:36:39.58
It's going to be somebody go down, but it's not going to be me and you just you just didn't think about that happening to you if you did

1602
01:36:40.38 --> 01:36:42.38
You probably wouldn't have finished the mission

1603
01:36:42.62 --> 01:36:49.06
Yeah, it's going to say maybe you get a guy like your earlier company commander who had deployed already who had done a Taro over there

1604
01:36:49.06 --> 01:36:55.38
And he had seen combat take to taking hits to his body and to his aircraft and eventually he realizes all this

1605
01:36:55.94 --> 01:36:59.98
I'm not quite as good as it may be your thought as lucky as I think I am and I'm just going to sit back here

1606
01:36:59.98 --> 01:37:04.58
Yeah, and I'm not invincible so and I could see that would happen with an old guy like that, but

1607
01:37:05.46 --> 01:37:09.18
Young guys and that's the reason they have young guys to tell a copter pilots and crew chiefs

1608
01:37:09.18 --> 01:37:13.70
That young guys just don't have any fear. Maybe we're not smart enough to have fear. Oh

1609
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:16.78
Yeah, I

1610
01:37:16.78 --> 01:37:19.78
Absolutely absolutely

1611
01:37:21.46 --> 01:37:26.50
Fast forward a little bit throughout the spring and summer of 1969 enemy forces attack fire bases along the border

1612
01:37:26.50 --> 01:37:31.58
Their tactics were always the same waiting until after midnight the enemy would commence their attack with a mortar and rocket

1613
01:37:31.58 --> 01:37:36.98
Parage and concert with sappers attempting to penetrate the wire followed by infantry waves attempting to penetrate the perimeter

1614
01:37:37.54 --> 01:37:41.98
LZ grant was a favorite target of these attacks several times between February and May

1615
01:37:41.98 --> 01:37:49.94
LZ grant experience major attacks the first in February saw the battalion commander lieutenant Colonel Gorvad killed when around hit the talk

1616
01:37:50.30 --> 01:37:55.72
He was seriously wounded, but refused to leave the battle the enemy managed to penetrate the perimeter wire and

1617
01:37:56.06 --> 01:38:03.78
Fighting was fierce to include artillery lowering the tubes and firing point blank into the charging enemy with anti-personnel shot

1618
01:38:03.78 --> 01:38:11.18
Blue max gunships were called in and engaged the follow on enemy as well as pursuing those attempting to retreat

1619
01:38:11.82 --> 01:38:15.02
In May LZ grant was under attack again simultaneously

1620
01:38:15.02 --> 01:38:24.20
Kwon Lloyd LZ Jamie and LZ Phyllis also came underground assaults that night the enemy wanted the first cavalry division out of three core region

1621
01:38:24.62 --> 01:38:29.66
Which was not going to happen. Yeah, they they they started stepping up the fight back then and

1622
01:38:29.66 --> 01:38:38.62
And hit those three LZs at the same time that that had everybody up and scrambling we got pulled out in the middle of the night to start flying resupply in there

1623
01:38:38.62 --> 01:38:42.86
And you had to be careful when you took the resupply in because you had you're trying to go in there

1624
01:38:43.10 --> 01:38:45.30
But where the NBA at around that wire?

1625
01:38:45.30 --> 01:38:51.02
So you're looking to see where most of the shootings at and you come in most of the time you come in fast and low and

1626
01:38:51.26 --> 01:38:56.50
Kick out and just that's the way the grunts want if they didn't want to have to run out there to grab ammo or grab your aircraft

1627
01:38:56.50 --> 01:39:02.14
But then as a day light came out then you'd start going in there and start getting more of the resupply in

1628
01:39:02.26 --> 01:39:06.96
Bring in reinforcements in I talked about we did one night combat assault that we brought

1629
01:39:07.34 --> 01:39:12.42
Reinforcements in and we put them about two clicks out and they were catching the NBA as the NBA

1630
01:39:12.42 --> 01:39:17.46
We're trying to get back to Cambodia, but yeah, they started picking up hitting those fire bases pretty hard

1631
01:39:22.66 --> 01:39:25.86
Fast forward a little bit. We had a new commander arriving August

1632
01:39:25.86 --> 01:39:30.58
Who was a major improvement major Robert Saunders. I say that right Saunders. Yeah

1633
01:39:31.14 --> 01:39:37.22
He was a leader and we recognize it almost immediately one of his first actions was to allow us to hire Hooch Mades

1634
01:39:37.54 --> 01:39:39.14
previous commanders wouldn't hear of it

1635
01:39:39.14 --> 01:39:44.34
So we cleaned our own tents now we had Hooch Mades that would come over from the village and clean out our rooms

1636
01:39:44.50 --> 01:39:47.90
Do our laundry and shine our boots in an effort to raise morale

1637
01:39:48.06 --> 01:39:54.58
Major Saunders directed that one Hooch would be turned into an officer into a club for the enlisted members of the unit

1638
01:39:54.58 --> 01:39:57.66
There wasn't another there wasn't another empty Hooch available

1639
01:39:57.66 --> 01:40:01.26
So he directed that the officers should build our own club

1640
01:40:01.66 --> 01:40:09.82
We had an engineer RL RLO pilot and he drew up a design for the commanders approval with a design

1641
01:40:09.82 --> 01:40:14.74
We then began a scavenger hunt for building material and before along we had an officer's club

1642
01:40:14.86 --> 01:40:22.34
The brigade the engineer brigade headquarters poured a concrete floor for us and returned for some flight time for their projects

1643
01:40:22.34 --> 01:40:28.86
Yeah, yeah, the about time Sanders got there. We moved out of the GP medium tents and moved to the other side of the chicken coop

1644
01:40:29.66 --> 01:40:33.10
The other side of the chicken pan and took over some wood buildings

1645
01:40:34.30 --> 01:40:37.90
That were Hooches and that's when Saunders said okay you can have Hooch Mades now

1646
01:40:37.90 --> 01:40:39.30
But he said I'll tell you right now

1647
01:40:39.30 --> 01:40:45.90
Ben and I've been he sex going on with the Hooch Mades and so the guys were they were pretty adamant about watching that that there would be no boom boom girls

1648
01:40:45.90 --> 01:40:50.06
And that that increased morale significantly right there

1649
01:40:50.06 --> 01:40:54.30
But then he said okay, there's an empty Hooch factory M club

1650
01:40:55.42 --> 01:40:57.26
Officers if you want one you build it yourself and

1651
01:40:58.18 --> 01:41:06.26
We did the engineer officer he drew up the plans for and we started scavenging and and scavenging stuff up. I seen to remember a pallet of

1652
01:41:07.46 --> 01:41:11.58
10 coming flying in one day on the bottom of the helicopter being delivered

1653
01:41:11.86 --> 01:41:16.42
But it was a great little club they had I we had a stone bar that

1654
01:41:16.42 --> 01:41:19.62
And we were located in a rubber tree plantation

1655
01:41:21.22 --> 01:41:24.66
Taboo cutting down a rubber tree you didn't dare cut down a rubber tree

1656
01:41:24.66 --> 01:41:27.70
In fact you could even run military operations in the in the

1657
01:41:28.54 --> 01:41:30.54
Plantations rubber tree plantations

1658
01:41:30.54 --> 01:41:34.70
So we built the bar out of stone and it went from the wall

1659
01:41:35.30 --> 01:41:40.20
To a tree in the middle of the club. I mean it was a nice looking bar we got none of that

1660
01:41:40.20 --> 01:41:45.26
You got new pictures of it. Oh, I wish I did I don't but we had this big tree growing up through the middle of the roof and

1661
01:41:45.26 --> 01:41:49.30
So we built our club and it was sheet metal on the outside is tin roof

1662
01:41:49.58 --> 01:41:52.66
We had a big cargo parachute that we requisitioned one day

1663
01:41:53.38 --> 01:41:57.26
Spread out over the top of it for extra shade and we put we got two of those parachutes

1664
01:41:57.26 --> 01:42:03.62
We put one over the elisted club as well. So the guys could sit outside and enjoy themselves outside. It was a nice club and

1665
01:42:04.38 --> 01:42:08.82
We used to have the pilots and be over there and then a lot of the other pilots from other units or

1666
01:42:09.10 --> 01:42:14.02
The engineer battalion brigade their headquarters guys have come over in the bed of act nurses would come over

1667
01:42:14.02 --> 01:42:18.40
So it was pretty nice little place. So this is what called what do we call the club?

1668
01:42:18.40 --> 01:42:23.58
They're just the club the chicken coop. What do we call it? Just call it the chicken house the chicken house. We had a chicken

1669
01:42:24.10 --> 01:42:26.10
Your mask was a rooster

1670
01:42:26.10 --> 01:42:28.58
For a dolly you could buy the rooster a shot of Scotch

1671
01:42:29.42 --> 01:42:31.10
Rooster would not drink beer

1672
01:42:31.10 --> 01:42:36.78
He drank. He drank Scotch. He drinks Scotch and that was it you'd buy a shot of Scotch for a doll of from from

1673
01:42:37.06 --> 01:42:41.70
Sam our bar made and she'd set it down form of the rooster and walk over and he'd sit there and drink that Scotch

1674
01:42:41.70 --> 01:42:46.46
And I about two of those that rooster couldn't walk anymore, but it was funny as hell watching that rooster

1675
01:42:46.46 --> 01:42:48.46
What was the rooster's name rooster?

1676
01:42:50.46 --> 01:42:53.42
The the seals that sealed team too during Vietnam had a had a

1677
01:42:54.22 --> 01:42:59.50
Monkey that they brought home from Vietnam. Oh my god, and they had it on the quarterback and it was like the most

1678
01:43:00.22 --> 01:43:04.62
Henri evil monkey the monkey's name was Joko

1679
01:43:06.18 --> 01:43:10.18
Like you read the partner in our book about the monkey didn't you? What about it? Oh?

1680
01:43:10.18 --> 01:43:11.46
Oh

1681
01:43:11.46 --> 01:43:15.18
One of our pilots. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, where do you took it in the aircraft?

1682
01:43:15.18 --> 01:43:16.66
Yeah, yeah, go ahead

1683
01:43:16.66 --> 01:43:21.90
The guy is a he's a right seat pilot and they had to admit that not in the head these monkeys. They were given monkeys

1684
01:43:22.10 --> 01:43:26.26
They're they get pretty damn big. Well, he bought one of them and it was kind of small and

1685
01:43:26.54 --> 01:43:29.98
He brought it out to the aircraft. Thank god. It was not the aircraft commander that day

1686
01:43:30.42 --> 01:43:35.78
So the monkey's sitting there and the monkey's jumping on his seat and he jumped over to the aircraft commander

1687
01:43:35.78 --> 01:43:41.02
She's sitting then he climbed up on the first aid kit behind the aircraft commander scurry of on over in the first aid kit

1688
01:43:41.50 --> 01:43:46.14
troops jump on board going for a combat assault and they think this is funny watching the monkey run back and forth

1689
01:43:47.14 --> 01:43:49.14
two minutes out

1690
01:43:49.14 --> 01:43:57.10
Cobbers roll hot one minute out the door gunners open up and when they opened up that monkey opened up with his bowels and his

1691
01:43:57.10 --> 01:44:00.70
Piss all over the pilot all over the aircraft commander

1692
01:44:00.70 --> 01:44:05.90
Scream and it said I'll find the aircraft commander reached up and grabbed him grabbed it by the neck and we're about 200 feet up

1693
01:44:05.90 --> 01:44:07.42
Toss that monkey out the window

1694
01:44:07.42 --> 01:44:10.30
I don't know if he learned how to skydive, but that monkey was gone

1695
01:44:10.50 --> 01:44:14.10
But nobody would go near that crew that day. They stunk so bad

1696
01:44:15.82 --> 01:44:21.14
Yeah, like I said I'm fast forwarded through a bunch of stuff. There's some stories in here. You've got a read for sure

1697
01:44:21.34 --> 01:44:23.34
That's one of them

1698
01:44:23.34 --> 01:44:28.34
The other one I was thinking that the monkeys and I'm not gonna cover today

1699
01:44:28.34 --> 01:44:35.54
But the guys are calling in that there being attacked there surrounded and all this stuff and you guys got over top and said you're surrounded

1700
01:44:35.98 --> 01:44:40.90
By monkeys. I we didn't tell those monkeys. We didn't we didn't want to we didn't want to bust the chops

1701
01:44:40.90 --> 01:44:46.98
It was a brand new patrol leader. It was a a lyrs team out there. So we just went ahead and okay

1702
01:44:46.98 --> 01:44:51.18
Yeah, we engaged the monkeys and they were able to any out of the area

1703
01:44:51.18 --> 01:44:54.10
So we got back in the brigade talk I said hey

1704
01:44:54.10 --> 01:44:58.48
What what the reports you get on the enemy situation at there might not quite be true

1705
01:45:05.58 --> 01:45:07.34
Next up

1706
01:45:07.34 --> 01:45:13.66
Ralph was a good aircraft commander a quiet man. He was the youngest pilot in the outfit as he joined the army right out of high school

1707
01:45:13.66 --> 01:45:19.50
He was not a drinker and spent as evenings working on college correspondents courses his mission for that day was flying C and C

1708
01:45:19.50 --> 01:45:29.42
For the divisions engineer Battalion commander the engineer Battalion commander wanted to fly out to where his engineers were working on various projects in the A O to see their progress

1709
01:45:29.42 --> 01:45:36.54
Not unreasonable as they were scattered all over the A O improving roads building a school and supporting projects on the various fire bases

1710
01:45:36.86 --> 01:45:42.34
The day started off normal and they were visiting the various locations however just after the lunch things changed

1711
01:45:42.34 --> 01:45:45.34
The Colonel wanted to go on a recon of some areas

1712
01:45:45.34 --> 01:45:50.24
Ralph agreed to fly those areas and be and proceeded to fly between

1713
01:45:50.72 --> 01:45:55.52
Corn, Lloyd and Song Bay the Colonel was focused on looking for clearings

1714
01:45:55.72 --> 01:45:58.86
Finally, he asked Ralph to take them down and land in one

1715
01:45:59.14 --> 01:46:03.74
Ralph asked for the frequency and call sign of the unit in the clearing so he could contact them prior to landing

1716
01:46:03.74 --> 01:46:10.74
Especially as he didn't see anyone in the clearing the Colonel came up with an excuse for why he couldn't provide the information and told Ralph just to land

1717
01:46:10.74 --> 01:46:16.86
Ralph insisted on a call sign of frequency before you take the aircraft down the Colonel became I rate

1718
01:46:17.18 --> 01:46:24.86
But when he accused Ralph of being a coward that was when things exploded Ralph reached up and disconnected his helmet from the inner calm system

1719
01:46:24.86 --> 01:46:29.54
Took the controls from the co-pilot and headed back to camp go go gorevad

1720
01:46:30.42 --> 01:46:36.94
The Colonel was live it Ralph didn't care didn't care reaching camp Corvad my saying his name or bad gorevad

1721
01:46:36.94 --> 01:46:40.86
And that's named after the time the commander that that was killed during that assault

1722
01:46:41.74 --> 01:46:46.82
Ralph landed at the engineering pad and told the Colonel politely but firmly to get out of his aircraft

1723
01:46:47.18 --> 01:46:53.40
He then called our battalion headquarters on the radio which was being monitored by almost every pilot from the battalion

1724
01:46:53.40 --> 01:47:00.72
And told them that he had just tossed the entost engineer six out of his aircraft and was returning to base to say the least

1725
01:47:00.72 --> 01:47:03.98
Shit was about to hit the fan making that call on the radio

1726
01:47:03.98 --> 01:47:07.60
Alerted every aircraft on the frequency as to what had happened

1727
01:47:07.98 --> 01:47:13.58
However someone saw Ralph's position in this and nothing came of it at least on

1728
01:47:13.94 --> 01:47:15.94
For Ralph

1729
01:47:15.94 --> 01:47:20.74
Yeah, you talk about egos in the engineer had an ego and

1730
01:47:21.38 --> 01:47:25.50
He was out to make himself a name for himself in the division. He was a fairly new guy and

1731
01:47:25.98 --> 01:47:32.06
He would do that. He tried to get an aircraft to go down and clear ring without anybody being in the clearing to protect them

1732
01:47:32.06 --> 01:47:35.58
Ralph's was smart enough to say no

1733
01:47:36.42 --> 01:47:42.16
Call on Ralph a coward bad mistake Ralph had already had to silver start this point and distinguish flying cross

1734
01:47:43.94 --> 01:47:49.10
This engineer batiny commander did that to my roommate and my roommate flew into the clearing

1735
01:47:49.50 --> 01:47:52.70
They never came out the NBA were waiting for him and everybody was killed

1736
01:47:52.70 --> 01:48:00.02
So Ralph did absolutely the right thing with this guy because of his ego wanting to impress everybody

1737
01:48:04.62 --> 01:48:06.62
Yeah

1738
01:48:07.82 --> 01:48:14.82
That you talk about that here exactly what happened when I this is fast forward a little bit when I returned from my mission

1739
01:48:14.82 --> 01:48:18.10
That evening major Saunders approached my aircraft as I was shutting down

1740
01:48:18.10 --> 01:48:25.18
Mr. Cori award police he said as opposed you open my door the major was standing in front of my aircraft and hadn't approached me

1741
01:48:25.18 --> 01:48:27.52
Yes, sir. I unstrapped climbed out and came over to him

1742
01:48:28.18 --> 01:48:30.82
It's a mystery Cori now instead of Dan what did I do wrong?

1743
01:48:31.58 --> 01:48:35.50
Let's walk Mr. Cooper he called over his shoulder addressing my copilot sir

1744
01:48:35.50 --> 01:48:37.86
Would you grab Dan's gear and put it and put it in his room?

1745
01:48:37.86 --> 01:48:40.58
Please yes, sir. He called back with a question to look on this face

1746
01:48:41.14 --> 01:48:44.90
We walk halfway back to the chicken coop with nothing said between us

1747
01:48:44.90 --> 01:48:50.48
But we're angling towards his hooch finally he said Dan. I have some bad news

1748
01:48:50.90 --> 01:48:55.26
Dave and YA were shot down today. I'm afraid the entire crew was killed

1749
01:48:55.74 --> 01:48:59.10
YA was Dave's copilot for the day and fairly new to the unit

1750
01:48:59.10 --> 01:49:05.78
I felt like I'd just been gut punched what happened sir as best as anyone could tell while supposedly flying from

1751
01:49:05.78 --> 01:49:11.96
Queun Lloyd a boot-top the engineer Colonel had again gone on a recon and convinced Dave to land in a clearing

1752
01:49:11.96 --> 01:49:18.22
A scout team happened to find the aircraft sitting there. It was obvious that someone had landed the aircraft before the enemy

1753
01:49:18.22 --> 01:49:25.04
Open fire with some heavy weapons as the only damage to the aircraft was in the cockpit and transmission and none in the engine or belly

1754
01:49:25.32 --> 01:49:27.64
The skids indicated a normal landing

1755
01:49:27.88 --> 01:49:33.36
Dave and YA were still strapped in their seats and Sergeant Alfred the door gunner was in his as well

1756
01:49:33.36 --> 01:49:39.84
The crew chief however was found about a hundred yards from the down-dear craft it appeared that specialist Collins fought as

1757
01:49:39.84 --> 01:49:48.68
M.T. as M.T. 556 shell casings were around him, but not a weapon the aircraft was booby trapped the Colonel and his staff were dead in the back of it

1758
01:49:49.08 --> 01:49:51.56
There'd been no friendly soldiers at the location

1759
01:49:53.16 --> 01:50:00.44
Damn that son of a bitch has gotten more aircraft shot up than anyone damn his sorry ass and now he's gotten people killed at

1760
01:50:00.72 --> 01:50:02.72
least his sorry ass was one of them bastard

1761
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:09.38
Major Sanders just let me rant while he opened a cabinet and pulled out a bottle of Johnny Walker scotch filling two clouds

1762
01:50:09.38 --> 01:50:18.16
Glasses he handed one to me and raised his own two absent comrades to Dave YA Alfred and Collins

1763
01:50:19.38 --> 01:50:25.90
A few days later I was sitting in my room writing a letter when my new roommate OE Richie came in from flying

1764
01:50:25.90 --> 01:50:31.02
He looked troubled as he grabbed a beer and tossed his flight gear on the bed. What's up Richie? I asked

1765
01:50:31.82 --> 01:50:38.34
Just a bad day saw my first crash and it was not pretty. He said finishing off the first beer and opening the second

1766
01:50:38.34 --> 01:50:45.02
What happened was it one of ours? I asked no. It was a Charlie company bird and one of the pilots was in my fight class

1767
01:50:45.02 --> 01:50:46.02
I

1768
01:50:46.02 --> 01:50:50.54
Just been talking to him before we launched and now him and his crew are dead hit a tree

1769
01:50:50.98 --> 01:50:52.34
Damn were you under fire?

1770
01:50:52.34 --> 01:50:57.30
No, we were coming out of an LZ which we'd been in four times already and the blade on the right side

1771
01:50:57.30 --> 01:50:59.30
Hit a tree at about 75 feet

1772
01:50:59.74 --> 01:51:03.34
Rotor blade just came apart and they crashed and burned no one got out

1773
01:51:04.50 --> 01:51:06.50
Damn sorry Owen who the pilots?

1774
01:51:06.50 --> 01:51:11.50
Let's see worn officer Thomas Brown was in flight school with me

1775
01:51:11.86 --> 01:51:20.14
Worn officer Dennis Varney was the AC specialist Marcin Shelby was the door gunner and the crew chief was specialist Robert Lazarus

1776
01:51:20.14 --> 01:51:24.42
I just met them on now or before when I went over to talk to Tom

1777
01:51:25.22 --> 01:51:32.62
O being another beer for myself. I raised it and tapped to Richie's beer in a toast to absent comrades

1778
01:51:32.62 --> 01:51:38.22
A few nights later our platoon leader came walking down the hall the CEO wants CC everyone in the club

1779
01:51:38.22 --> 01:51:41.58
He said we all started heading that way the CEO did not look happy

1780
01:51:42.86 --> 01:51:49.14
Gentlemen take a seat after you get a beer he didn't have to say that twice after everyone was seated and holding a cold one

1781
01:51:49.42 --> 01:51:52.14
The major raised his beer to absent comrades

1782
01:51:52.90 --> 01:51:58.06
The look of shock and dread was on everyone's face. We all stood and raised our drinks to absent comrades

1783
01:51:58.42 --> 01:52:01.62
We all repeated and chugged our beers still wondering who'd we lost?

1784
01:52:01.62 --> 01:52:08.62
Motioning us to sit down the major looked over everyone before he started to speak Charlie company lost a crew last night

1785
01:52:08.94 --> 01:52:14.10
They were on a night mission out of LZ buttons and ran into bad weather at about

1786
01:52:14.74 --> 01:52:16.26
0-200 hours

1787
01:52:16.26 --> 01:52:22.46
They attempted to take off in the fog the grunts on the perimeter said they had all their lights on so they could see them in the soup

1788
01:52:22.94 --> 01:52:27.18
The aircraft got to about 200 feet and then it crossed the perimeter wire

1789
01:52:27.18 --> 01:52:33.14
They'd have as it crossed the perimeter wire it appeared to roll 90 degrees and crashed into the trees on the perimeter

1790
01:52:34.62 --> 01:52:36.62
The whole crew was lost

1791
01:52:37.18 --> 01:52:43.90
Yeah, that that period of time we started losing crews and we knew a lot of the crews in the other units because we flew a lot together

1792
01:52:44.10 --> 01:52:50.06
a lot of times they'd have maybe a unit could put four birds up for a lift and you'd get tagged to put two your birds with them

1793
01:52:50.06 --> 01:52:52.74
See you got to know the other crews and the other pilots as well

1794
01:52:52.74 --> 01:52:59.46
But this period of time when Saunders got there that's when we started losing a lot of birds and it kept right on up for the rest of the time

1795
01:52:59.46 --> 01:53:01.46
I was there

1796
01:53:01.46 --> 01:53:06.26
The night birds the who had minimum minimum instruments for weather flying and

1797
01:53:07.06 --> 01:53:12.42
If the guys didn't practice their weather flying they were rusty at it and tried to pull off from the fog

1798
01:53:13.14 --> 01:53:17.06
That sounds like what happened there. You just wasn't on his instruments that tight and

1799
01:53:17.06 --> 01:53:22.58
He lost control of the aircraft hitting the tree that happened frequently in fact

1800
01:53:22.58 --> 01:53:29.90
My last mission one of my last missions one of our birds in a tree had about 75 feet up and we got one guy out

1801
01:53:30.26 --> 01:53:32.74
We didn't think he would make it but

1802
01:53:33.78 --> 01:53:39.34
Last summer I had lunch with him at the congressional golf club in Washington, DC and he pulled through

1803
01:53:39.34 --> 01:53:42.74
He's in a coma for six weeks, but he looks good

1804
01:53:42.74 --> 01:53:48.90
He said from the neck daddy said I'm one big scar, but from the face up he looked John look pretty good, so

1805
01:53:52.90 --> 01:53:55.86
And the thing isn't I think a lot of times

1806
01:53:56.66 --> 01:54:00.34
People don't understand I mean when this stuff is happening the war goes on oh

1807
01:54:00.50 --> 01:54:02.10
Yeah, it's like okay

1808
01:54:02.10 --> 01:54:06.34
We still have a mission to do we're still gonna get the birds spun up we're still gonna go out and do our job

1809
01:54:06.34 --> 01:54:10.58
Yeah, now you still you got to put it behind you at that time

1810
01:54:10.58 --> 01:54:16.34
I don't know how it wasn't other units, but at that time in our unit we never did have a memorial service

1811
01:54:16.50 --> 01:54:18.50
Well, somebody was lost the

1812
01:54:18.82 --> 01:54:22.58
Just before I left we had a guy that we all loved nearly a crew chief and

1813
01:54:23.90 --> 01:54:26.44
We're on a combat assault and he got shot in the arm pit

1814
01:54:26.44 --> 01:54:31.30
Well, the chicken plate didn't cover the arm pit and he died we had a memorial service for him

1815
01:54:31.38 --> 01:54:35.38
But anybody else we lost the the memorial service was get drunk in the club that night

1816
01:54:35.78 --> 01:54:40.34
so a lot of us just didn't have any and he good thoughts

1817
01:54:40.34 --> 01:54:42.74
About when we left there so it was

1818
01:54:44.34 --> 01:54:48.66
It was good to see good good to have a drunk fest anyway with the guys

1819
01:54:53.90 --> 01:54:59.64
Fast forward a little bit my crew and I arrived at the aircraft and conducted our pre-flight good morning

1820
01:54:59.64 --> 01:55:05.22
Pozy how she look I asked my crew chief all good missed all good Mr. C answered as you close the engine

1821
01:55:05.22 --> 01:55:11.78
Cowling quill and how's it guns and ammo I asked my gunner fresh cans ammo this morning Mr. Curry were good Mr. Cory were good

1822
01:55:12.34 --> 01:55:17.88
He responded I climbed up and looked over the roader head while my coat pilot for the day worn off

1823
01:55:17.88 --> 01:55:21.94
Sir Ron Fender did the walk around inspection and tail rotor all appeared to be good

1824
01:55:21.94 --> 01:55:27.28
We strapped in start of the engine and waited ready ready to assume the mission if called upon

1825
01:55:27.28 --> 01:55:35.44
Hey one nine or two seven is down assume his mission in contact Badger six when you reach quann loy for further instructions

1826
01:55:36.44 --> 01:55:41.04
Flight operator instructed Roger 3 and the one nine or has it I started pulling power oh guy

1827
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:47.40
Okay guys coming out about this time I saw chip rumble chicken man two seven along with his co-pilot

1828
01:55:47.40 --> 01:55:52.36
War officer McCartney waving to me and running over I set the aircraft back down

1829
01:55:52.36 --> 01:55:58.28
Jumping on the skid next to my door chip ass. Hey Dan. I'm I'm low time pilot for the month. Let me take the mission

1830
01:55:58.52 --> 01:56:03.04
He had just returned from a seven day R&R trip to Hawaii and hadn't flown much for the past month

1831
01:56:03.36 --> 01:56:09.84
You got it. I said is Ron and I unstrapped and climbed out turning over the aircraft aircraft to chip and McCartney

1832
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:13.84
We watched as they hovered out of the chicken pen and onto the runway

1833
01:56:13.84 --> 01:56:18.56
We were walking back to flight operations when they started down the runway and disappeared behind the trees

1834
01:56:18.56 --> 01:56:25.04
Reaching flight operations we went in first class Sergeant first class Robinson was crying

1835
01:56:25.20 --> 01:56:29.80
He saw us and immediately got a shot look on his face. Oh my god. Who's flying your aircraft?

1836
01:56:29.80 --> 01:56:31.96
The asked I told him why what's the problem?

1837
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:35.58
They got off the runway and we're climbing out when the rotor head came off

1838
01:56:36.80 --> 01:56:38.80
They're all dead

1839
01:56:38.80 --> 01:56:45.24
Yeah, I was stunned and suddenly sick to my stomach outside I threw up Ron dropped through his knees and started and stared at the ground

1840
01:56:45.24 --> 01:56:50.16
I went back to my room and just sat on my bed 30 minutes later major Saunders stock stopped by

1841
01:56:50.52 --> 01:56:54.08
You okay Danny asked. I don't know sir. I checked that heading it all look good

1842
01:56:54.44 --> 01:56:58.84
What happened? I don't know but the accident investigation board will figure it out. You just take it easy

1843
01:56:59.000 --> 01:56:59.80
He left

1844
01:56:59.80 --> 01:57:03.96
But about an hour later. He was back Dan. I hate to ask you but can you take a mission?

1845
01:57:03.96 --> 01:57:09.12
It seems Lieutenant weed is to upset to fly his mission and his brought back his aircraft

1846
01:57:09.24 --> 01:57:14.36
Lieutenant weed was close to chip the aircraft commander. Yes, sir. I got it. I picked up my gear

1847
01:57:14.36 --> 01:57:16.68
I'll walk out with you. I want you to see

1848
01:57:17.24 --> 01:57:21.20
I want to see just how upset he is the major and I walked together to the flight line

1849
01:57:21.20 --> 01:57:27.36
We didn't say much as there wasn't a lot to say I didn't expect what came at me as soon as Lieutenant weed saw me

1850
01:57:27.36 --> 01:57:31.04
He threw his helmet on the ground and came at me. You son of a bitch Cory

1851
01:57:31.04 --> 01:57:36.92
This is your damn fault major Saunders step between us Lieutenant stop right there get your shit and go to your room

1852
01:57:36.92 --> 01:57:43.52
Not another word. Do you hear me now go turning to me the CO said Dan forget this and get on with the mission

1853
01:57:43.52 --> 01:57:49.04
This wasn't over however that night at the club lieutenant weed proceeded to allow me bowed mouth me

1854
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:52.76
I let it go as he was lieutenant and I was just a warrant, but I finally had enough

1855
01:57:52.76 --> 01:57:55.96
Hey lieutenant dick weed with all due respect for your rank go to hell

1856
01:57:55.96 --> 01:58:01.30
I knew using his full name as modified by the worn-offsters would piss him off and it did with that

1857
01:58:01.30 --> 01:58:06.92
He was up and headed straight for me. I was off my bar stool and eager to get it on with him looking forward to hurting him

1858
01:58:06.92 --> 01:58:12.28
I was not a brawler but could hold my own in a fight just before he got to me captain Armstrong

1859
01:58:12.28 --> 01:58:15.96
A platoon leader step behind him and jerk him off his feet

1860
01:58:17.08 --> 01:58:24.08
Don't you dare move lieutenant captain Armstrong was an infantry officer of considerable size very tall and very muscular

1861
01:58:24.24 --> 01:58:28.38
He was a no-nonsense man Mr. Cory. I think you should retire for the night now

1862
01:58:28.38 --> 01:58:32.56
He told me yes sir and I departed back to my room in the worn-offsters hooch

1863
01:58:32.56 --> 01:58:41.86
After any aircraft accident and accident investigation has held my copilot was interviewed as were the assistant maintenance officer and myself

1864
01:58:41.86 --> 01:58:44.36
The crash site was well was examined as well

1865
01:58:44.96 --> 01:58:51.28
The rotor head was flown to a general aviation support facility at Vung to and examined

1866
01:58:51.52 --> 01:58:55.42
The results were posted and indicated that the rotor headed not come off

1867
01:58:55.54 --> 01:59:01.44
But it failed the rotor head that had been put on the aircraft the night before was a rebuilt one

1868
01:59:01.44 --> 01:59:08.74
During the rebuilding the bolt holes for the bolts that held the pitch change horn had been cleaned and resized

1869
01:59:09.24 --> 01:59:10.24
1 millimeter

1870
01:59:10.24 --> 01:59:15.52
However, the same original bolt sizes were installed upon the U.S. NS

1871
01:59:15.52 --> 01:59:22.04
Court this Christie afloatting aircraft overhaul facility those original bolts were one millimeter too small

1872
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.24
Between the test flight and the takeoff the bolts holding pitch change horn had failed due to the stress

1873
01:59:29.24 --> 01:59:34.64
And the result was a loss of control over the blades making the aircraft unstable in flight the

1874
01:59:34.92 --> 01:59:42.32
Investigation board found that there was no way to the assistant maintenance officer or I could have found the problem as the bolts hadn't twisted out

1875
01:59:42.32 --> 01:59:44.88
But it's simply an instantly torn out

1876
01:59:45.40 --> 01:59:49.48
The bolts were never found but the condition of the bolt holes told the story

1877
01:59:50.32 --> 01:59:53.12
Easy for them to say but this would haunt me every day

1878
01:59:53.12 --> 01:59:57.48
I couldn't help but think that it was something I should have caught on the pre flight

1879
01:59:57.48 --> 02:00:02.04
It could have been me and my co-pilot we had come that close

1880
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:09.32
Yeah, that's that it's and it just wanted me for a long time

1881
02:00:10.68 --> 02:00:13.08
I lost posy I lost Quinn and

1882
02:00:14.28 --> 02:00:16.28
It was that close that

1883
02:00:17.32 --> 02:00:22.92
That we almost bought the farm the maintenance officer had flown the bird the night before after they put the rotor head on it and

1884
02:00:22.92 --> 02:00:27.72
All seemed well and then we got out here on the morning and looked at it. I did the rotor head

1885
02:00:29.28 --> 02:00:33.60
The safety wires were all in place the slippage marks were all lined up and everything looked good and

1886
02:00:35.64 --> 02:00:42.96
But when chip went out he pulled full power when he came off the end of the runway and those four bolts that hold that pitch change horn on

1887
02:00:43.52 --> 02:00:45.52
They just blew out and

1888
02:00:46.40 --> 02:00:50.28
They said when they made this officer told me so when we took it down the long time

1889
02:00:50.28 --> 02:00:56.66
They looked in there they could see where the threads had just been ripped apart they hadn't they hadn't been screwed out

1890
02:00:56.66 --> 02:01:02.52
They could just where the bolts exploded out of there. So we lost the crew lossy aircraft

1891
02:01:12.16 --> 02:01:15.76
Talk about some other missions that you did you talk about doing some sioffs missions

1892
02:01:15.76 --> 02:01:17.76
Yeah

1893
02:01:17.96 --> 02:01:24.64
Which yeah, they didn't like me to do sioffs missions. Why is that? Well, I did that one mitsiops mission and and

1894
02:01:25.20 --> 02:01:27.60
You know, it was just after David died. It was just after

1895
02:01:28.28 --> 02:01:30.28
Chip McCartney and we killed and

1896
02:01:30.28 --> 02:01:35.76
They say okay, you're gonna go out there fly the sioffs mission. Okay, so they put these big loud speakers in the sight of the aircraft

1897
02:01:35.76 --> 02:01:40.40
And this Vietnamese captain jumps in and they say okay, why don't you go out there's crossroads?

1898
02:01:40.40 --> 02:01:43.000
So we fly out to this crossroads where at 2500 feet

1899
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.52
Who are flying around this guy's in the back of the aircraft? You know, sing song Vietnamese language for two hoys, right?

1900
02:01:48.52 --> 02:01:51.92
Yeah for two hoys. You can try to get the North Vietnamese surrender

1901
02:01:52.60 --> 02:01:55.16
So I courage you've loved life at that time and

1902
02:01:55.52 --> 02:02:00.60
Look, that says hey, just a quarry. There's a bunch of guys down here in the in the bamboo. They're digging trenches

1903
02:02:00.60 --> 02:02:06.76
Right alongside the intersection. So yeah, so I look over there. I thought shit there. They are and V.A. Down here

1904
02:02:07.80 --> 02:02:09.80
and

1905
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:12.20
I turn to the American sergeant. I said hey

1906
02:02:12.20 --> 02:02:17.08
Yeah, you think those guys can hear from us meet up at 2500 feet when she likes to go down a little lower

1907
02:02:17.48 --> 02:02:22.40
He goes just a quarry nobody will fly at 1515 hundred's idea. I said how taken 15 hundred

1908
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:27.48
So as I'm lower in the aircraft down to 1500 flying this orbit around these North Vietnamese guys

1909
02:02:27.48 --> 02:02:31.24
And I turn to my copies and get song Bay artillery on the line

1910
02:02:31.64 --> 02:02:34.84
He calls up song Bay Artians is fire mission standby

1911
02:02:35.32 --> 02:02:37.52
Give some of the coordinates there. He thing we get down there

1912
02:02:37.52 --> 02:02:43.28
Sure enough and V.A. start shooting up at us. So I said we're taking fire and he says

1913
02:02:43.60 --> 02:02:47.04
He said yeah, we're on Mr. Bridges. You need to go back up. I said no, we need to get a little further out

1914
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:49.52
So I've just moved out a little bit further. Let's keep shooting

1915
02:02:49.52 --> 02:02:54.80
Well, that's what I call the artillery and autumn and the Vietnamese captain in the back. He just went ballistic

1916
02:02:54.80 --> 02:02:58.76
I mean, you know, they're supposed to surrender and I said well if he talks at him now

1917
02:02:58.76 --> 02:03:01.40
They're gonna be more willing to surrender after we hit him with smart artillery

1918
02:03:01.40 --> 02:03:04.56
We did we put about 12 rounds in there on top of these guys and

1919
02:03:04.56 --> 02:03:08.08
And after that the Vietnamese guy didn't want to argue with any more

1920
02:03:08.08 --> 02:03:11.92
He took back in the American captain charge of the soaps program. He came up. He says

1921
02:03:12.40 --> 02:03:17.52
We're gonna have to crash scratch this mission office of failure. I said hey, you know

1922
02:03:17.68 --> 02:03:20.96
They started shooting first and I was protecting my crew and you're crews well

1923
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:25.64
So he's he just kind of laughed at me and he tapped me on the show. He says yeah, got it. I understand

1924
02:03:26.44 --> 02:03:28.44
I hated sobs missions

1925
02:03:29.64 --> 02:03:31.64
This was crazy

1926
02:03:31.64 --> 02:03:38.52
Your dad was still in the Navy at this time. Yeah, and he's now an officer and he's in freaking

1927
02:03:38.52 --> 02:03:40.52
Saga. Yeah, yeah, he was living well

1928
02:03:41.60 --> 02:03:44.40
He was one of the ramps. He was one of the ramps and Saga

1929
02:03:44.96 --> 02:03:46.96
Well deserved every

1930
02:03:46.96 --> 02:03:50.12
Three-fought World War II was on submarines. I got no with rope problem with him

1931
02:03:50.12 --> 02:03:53.66
Enjoying some five and Saga. So I went and asked a couple of commanders. I said hey sir

1932
02:03:53.66 --> 02:03:55.66
This was Sanders still I said

1933
02:03:56.30 --> 02:03:58.70
And he was Cassandra was getting cords his end of his tour

1934
02:03:58.70 --> 02:04:00.70
So I said hey my dad's in Saga on

1935
02:04:02.18 --> 02:04:05.94
Could he come up in five three days with me or something like that my thought centers is a thing

1936
02:04:05.94 --> 02:04:08.42
You know, you know, no hell no they said sure bring him up

1937
02:04:08.94 --> 02:04:14.70
Okay, we'll bring him up so dad came up and I picked him up in Saga and he jumped in the front seat

1938
02:04:14.70 --> 02:04:17.06
We're before you get there when you're in Saga

1939
02:04:17.06 --> 02:04:22.34
I know you went to a officer's club with him. Oh, yeah, and they come to kick you out

1940
02:04:22.34 --> 02:04:23.98
Well as you're going into the officer's club

1941
02:04:23.98 --> 02:04:30.04
You see like a bunch of nice pistols hanging up on the wall and you're thinking yeah, unskilled no one's watching them

1942
02:04:30.04 --> 02:04:34.000
And you're thinking well, that doesn't seem very smart. So then you sit down having some lunch with your dad

1943
02:04:34.72 --> 02:04:41.58
They kicked us out they kick you out because you're not a field great officer, which is a major lieutenant commander above

1944
02:04:42.06 --> 02:04:44.06
So they kick you out on your way out

1945
02:04:45.18 --> 02:04:47.18
Some of those weapons with you

1946
02:04:47.18 --> 02:04:55.58
So you end up with a nice instead of that 38 caliber pistol that wasn't very effective you end up with a

1947
02:04:55.94 --> 02:05:00.02
45 a nice 19 11. I'm sure not that's not quite this the right way

1948
02:05:00.38 --> 02:05:03.98
Let's just say that when I got back to light. K. I had a brand new 45

1949
02:05:04.06 --> 02:05:06.06
Okay

1950
02:05:06.06 --> 02:05:10.86
So so your dad ends up freaking coming up. How old you're dad at this point?

1951
02:05:10.86 --> 02:05:17.70
That's probably about 43 44. Okay. He's in the game. Oh, yeah, he's in the game. He's

1952
02:05:19.78 --> 02:05:21.78
I think he was

1953
02:05:21.78 --> 02:05:25.94
He was about 50 when he retired from the Navy and this was three years before he retired from the Navy

1954
02:05:25.94 --> 02:05:32.22
So he's in his late 40s okay, so he came up and what was he doing? What was he some kind of a liaison or something?

1955
02:05:32.22 --> 02:05:39.38
No, no, he was in J6 at Mac Veehead Corps communications and I guess I can say it now

1956
02:05:39.38 --> 02:05:43.94
It's not class funny more but he was working on the communications plant for the repatriation of POWs

1957
02:05:43.94 --> 02:05:46.94
God is is what he was doing at the time so

1958
02:05:47.74 --> 02:05:49.74
So he came up to like a and

1959
02:05:50.98 --> 02:05:55.54
Spend about three days with it flew as my a crew chief or no, he's flew as my door gunner

1960
02:05:55.54 --> 02:05:58.82
Give my my crew chief at some time off, but he did good

1961
02:05:58.82 --> 02:06:03.32
He had had has asked you a little bit. Yeah, so tell us about the first gunfight

1962
02:06:03.32 --> 02:06:06.18
Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, we're a flat along there and

1963
02:06:06.18 --> 02:06:11.26
He's working the LZs and and he's doing good clearing this in clearing this out stuff like that

1964
02:06:11.26 --> 02:06:12.78
So we got the troops on board

1965
02:06:12.78 --> 02:06:17.58
troops all get on the aircraft and dad uniform as the same as ours of fatigues and

1966
02:06:18.46 --> 02:06:21.30
He had his major is Lieutenant Commander's leaf on you

1967
02:06:21.30 --> 02:06:26.94
Which is just a little smaller than the the army major leaf the grunts are back there in the back and all of a sudden

1968
02:06:26.94 --> 02:06:28.94
Somebody starts pulling on my collar

1969
02:06:28.94 --> 02:06:31.18
I've looked over this grunts pulling I can go

1970
02:06:31.46 --> 02:06:33.46
Hey, sir, what's your rank?

1971
02:06:33.46 --> 02:06:35.46
I said I'm a W2 why and he goes

1972
02:06:35.46 --> 02:06:38.82
Damn did that major back there screw ups. It's easier door gunner

1973
02:06:40.02 --> 02:06:43.58
So then I told them no, it's my dad. He's flying with us. So they thought that was pretty cool

1974
02:06:43.74 --> 02:06:45.74
So we going on this combat assault

1975
02:06:45.98 --> 02:06:48.48
We were in a chop five or six position and

1976
02:06:49.14 --> 02:06:54.22
We're going in on a staggered right formation so you got one aircraft in front of you and you got one off the side

1977
02:06:55.82 --> 02:07:01.26
Six minutes out the artillery goes in the artillery cuts off it two minutes out the coppers roll hot one minute out

1978
02:07:01.26 --> 02:07:05.70
Door gunners open fire and right away we start seeing green tracers and

1979
02:07:06.64 --> 02:07:12.26
I hear my crew chief's gunfire in but I don't hear my dad's and I said dad open fire

1980
02:07:13.50 --> 02:07:19.54
Nothing and I'm thinking oh shit. He's been hit and I turn over my shoulder and look

1981
02:07:20.22 --> 02:07:27.38
He's standing on the skids. He's got his monkey harness on and he's taking pictures out in front

1982
02:07:27.38 --> 02:07:33.98
I got on that right I got on the intercom is a dad get your ass in here and get on it

1983
02:07:33.98 --> 02:07:35.98
God damn gun

1984
02:07:35.98 --> 02:07:37.34
He gets on the gun. Well we got back

1985
02:07:37.86 --> 02:07:39.86
We had a discussion about

1986
02:07:40.10 --> 02:07:44.26
Crew chief do the he's a door gun on the air guy and he wrote my mother and he says you know

1987
02:07:44.26 --> 02:07:48.82
I've had a lot of ass tunes in my Navy career, but that's the worst one I've ever had and he took it

1988
02:07:48.82 --> 02:07:50.82
I'll give him credit. He took it

1989
02:07:50.82 --> 02:07:52.82
quite well and

1990
02:07:53.06 --> 02:07:56.02
He came back fluids about three or four times that's crazy

1991
02:07:56.02 --> 02:08:01.98
I like this this conversation you had with your dad. It says he says I noticed one thing different about

1992
02:08:02.14 --> 02:08:08.10
Those air force pilots from you guys air force pilots seem to be outgoing and always in a positive mood

1993
02:08:08.42 --> 02:08:15.42
Versus you guys who always seemed withdrawn and pensive he explained and then you replied dad and air force pilot is that way

1994
02:08:15.42 --> 02:08:21.10
Because he's flying a machine that wants to fly and if left alone will generally fly quite well on its own

1995
02:08:21.10 --> 02:08:28.18
In addition compared to a helicopter an airplane has very few moving parts that can cause a serious malfunction on the other hand

1996
02:08:28.46 --> 02:08:34.14
Helicopter pilots fly a machine that does not want to fly and only does and only does so by the

1997
02:08:34.34 --> 02:08:38.06
Interactions of the pilot to balance four forces all opposed to each other

1998
02:08:38.38 --> 02:08:42.18
plus a helicopter has a lot of moving parts any of which

1999
02:08:42.46 --> 02:08:45.78
Breaking can and does cause a major disaster

2000
02:08:45.78 --> 02:08:51.42
Helicopter pilots are moody because we know something is going to break if it hasn't done so already

2001
02:08:51.70 --> 02:08:57.94
That's right that gave the old man something to think about it. Dad had flown with the one of the things he did when he came up at a

2002
02:08:57.94 --> 02:09:02.86
Like we had a OV10 squadron that flew out of there the Broncos and

2003
02:09:03.70 --> 02:09:08.54
We got him a ride in one and he went out and flew with him. He flew with a Captain Rider and was straight in captain

2004
02:09:08.54 --> 02:09:12.32
It was an exchange officer and he thought that was pretty cool out there flying with those guys and

2005
02:09:12.32 --> 02:09:16.72
And so when he came back in that night that's when this this conversation came up about you know

2006
02:09:17.24 --> 02:09:21.52
The fighter pilots there just jovial and happy and et cetera and you guys you're all kind of

2007
02:09:21.88 --> 02:09:26.24
Moody and down in the dumps. I said yeah, and that's why you know we fly something that doesn't want to fly a

2008
02:09:26.68 --> 02:09:28.38
Harry Reesner about

2009
02:09:29.08 --> 02:09:30.28
1973

2010
02:09:30.28 --> 02:09:32.28
wrote a great article about

2011
02:09:33.24 --> 02:09:40.56
Helicopter pilots and helicopters and it's it's kind of long that same line is what what dad-nice conversation was

2012
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:43.76
Yeah, well, it's like you said a plane

2013
02:09:44.60 --> 02:09:49.88
You can you can let go of the stick and it'll kind of just cruise for a while. Yeah, it'll fly itself

2014
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:53.72
But a helicopter is not that's not happening. That's not happening. That's not happening

2015
02:09:54.88 --> 02:10:00.24
They have now a helicopter that do have an autopilot on them, but in those days

2016
02:10:00.24 --> 02:10:02.24
Do you like go with those controls in the Huey?

2017
02:10:02.92 --> 02:10:04.92
Yeah, they're telling where she's gonna go

2018
02:10:04.92 --> 02:10:06.92
Mm-hmm

2019
02:10:08.96 --> 02:10:14.92
Fast forward a little bit you get you eventually get orders and you're gonna go to Fort Ord which to you sounds great

2020
02:10:14.92 --> 02:10:18.48
Because it's up by mom and rain you start like thinking oh I'm gonna California. I'm gonna beat

2021
02:10:18.48 --> 02:10:24.72
Yeah, but it's gonna be awesome and then you start asking people about what the deal is and you start hearing that it's actually horrible to be there

2022
02:10:25.32 --> 02:10:31.12
It's expensive as hell and the high school kids are driving around in jags and Mercedes and and you're gonna

2023
02:10:31.12 --> 02:10:35.64
Barely scrape by won't be able to afford to anything as a worn officer and

2024
02:10:36.92 --> 02:10:42.88
So you figure out okay, I'm gonna try and get my orders changed and you go talk to your CEO and

2025
02:10:43.60 --> 02:10:46.80
And you say hey can I get my my orders change?

2026
02:10:46.80 --> 02:10:50.32
He's like no, I can't do that. Well, you think I think I'm magic and then he says now wait one

2027
02:10:50.48 --> 02:10:54.32
There is a way you can change your orders now as excited there is how

2028
02:10:54.84 --> 02:10:58.38
You can extend for six months and stay in nom he was grinning

2029
02:10:58.38 --> 02:11:00.38
Did he have something to do with my RFO?

2030
02:11:00.38 --> 02:11:07.46
I wondered sir you're kidding hell I've already had my cherry busted had a door gunner wounded had hydraulic failure and a compressor stall

2031
02:11:07.46 --> 02:11:15.34
Added that over 1300 hours of flying here. I didn't mention the aircraft had gone down with the pitch change horn failure

2032
02:11:15.34 --> 02:11:20.72
The one I'd almost ridden in he knew that was on the score card without me mentioning it

2033
02:11:20.72 --> 02:11:26.66
Yeah, you've racked up some time, but that's only but that's the only choice you have think about it and he headed to the bar

2034
02:11:27.06 --> 02:11:28.78
Yes, yeah

2035
02:11:28.78 --> 02:11:32.46
And I really thought at the time I thought well hey he just changed my orders not a problem

2036
02:11:32.46 --> 02:11:36.26
But no, it wasn't but hey, man though and the

2037
02:11:37.18 --> 02:11:40.54
Patoon leader the tenant your bow chop or Captain bow shop

2038
02:11:41.34 --> 02:11:46.38
They had probably already worked this out ahead of time. I'm thinking they didn't have anything to do with me getting orders to ord

2039
02:11:47.02 --> 02:11:56.98
But put in the idea of my head to extend and up to this time we had not had guys extending at least for our unit and so when I said okay

2040
02:11:56.98 --> 02:12:01.46
I'll extend I'm thinking I'll go to a meta-vac unit which is what you kind of wanted to do

2041
02:12:01.46 --> 02:12:04.98
Yeah, because you don't have to fly in for me. Yeah, so because I have to fly formation

2042
02:12:05.38 --> 02:12:07.38
but then

2043
02:12:07.38 --> 02:12:11.54
Bochampus so they so they get you to extend yeah, they got you to say listen yeah

2044
02:12:11.54 --> 02:12:13.94
You don't go to meta-vac unit will be in the rear with the gear

2045
02:12:13.94 --> 02:12:17.62
You know and you'll have to fly the nurses and you'll be nurses there in the whole nine yards

2046
02:12:17.70 --> 02:12:20.34
So you agree you seem like a good idea

2047
02:12:20.34 --> 02:12:25.86
You're not gonna get it or you can go back to someplace once you get orders you'll go back to someplace better than ord

2048
02:12:25.86 --> 02:12:33.86
And so you get that extension yep and then and then you guys go out you can do some drinking and and now you guys are drinking hard

2049
02:12:33.86 --> 02:12:37.46
I'm gonna order the book after about an hour this is a complete about an hour about people feed new drinks

2050
02:12:37.46 --> 02:12:41.14
The company clerk came up to me in the officers club and asked me to sign some papers

2051
02:12:41.14 --> 02:12:44.18
What's this for I asked with a slight slur and blurry eyes?

2052
02:12:44.18 --> 02:12:46.18
I was becoming as drunk as our rooster

2053
02:12:47.30 --> 02:12:51.38
Who frequented in the club each night with Fed Scott's a damn rooster would not drink beer expensive taste

2054
02:12:51.94 --> 02:12:55.22
Oh, it's just some paperwork. I need your signature for on the extension

2055
02:12:55.22 --> 02:13:00.74
He said and I signed it without another thought. I thought I had submitted everything as he left the RLOs

2056
02:13:00.90 --> 02:13:05.06
Excuse themselves slapping each other on the back and laughing their asses off two nights later

2057
02:13:05.06 --> 02:13:09.54
I found out what was so funny the major wanted all the pilots in the club for meeting and

2058
02:13:10.58 --> 02:13:12.82
And then he goes in there and he announces that

2059
02:13:14.74 --> 02:13:16.58
I'm happy to announce one of our

2060
02:13:16.58 --> 02:13:24.34
Chickens has decided to stay in the coupe Mister Cori has graciously modified his extension to remain with us instead of going to a

2061
02:13:24.34 --> 02:13:26.02
MetaVac unit. Thank you, Dan

2062
02:13:26.02 --> 02:13:31.62
That's what happened. Oh, yeah, you got your drunk and you signed papers to stay on I did then

2063
02:13:32.50 --> 02:13:35.46
Right after he announced well the who's in the new instructor pilot and

2064
02:13:36.10 --> 02:13:39.54
One of the pilots asked not and they just kind of grin and he looked around he goes

2065
02:13:39.70 --> 02:13:43.06
Mister Cori's the new instructor pilot so it's also about the instructor duties

2066
02:13:43.06 --> 02:13:47.06
Yeah, the instructor duties you're the unit instructor pilot and your job was to

2067
02:13:47.62 --> 02:13:50.74
When a new pilot showed up in the unit they flew with you

2068
02:13:51.14 --> 02:13:55.94
Their first orientation flight would be with you and then frequently they would fly with you then

2069
02:13:55.94 --> 02:14:00.74
Well, it major decided that since I was gonna take my extension leaving about a month and a half

2070
02:14:01.22 --> 02:14:03.94
He wanted me to fly with new pilots only

2071
02:14:04.50 --> 02:14:09.30
So a pilot a new pilot would come in and we had two come in right away almost Mr

2072
02:14:09.30 --> 02:14:16.50
I forget the one gentleman's name the other one was Dumas but I would fly with one on one day and fly with the other one the other day and

2073
02:14:16.50 --> 02:14:18.90
Fights and first the days they weren't flying with me

2074
02:14:18.90 --> 02:14:20.90
They'd be flying with another AC

2075
02:14:20.90 --> 02:14:26.90
But it was my job to teach them combat flying combat other rotations combat takeoffs how to get real hoverhole

2076
02:14:27.78 --> 02:14:32.74
Those sorts of things and you're still doing your normal missions. Oh, yeah, what's going on? Why with the new guys? Yeah, yeah

2077
02:14:32.74 --> 02:14:38.02
You just you you fly the normal missions just now you got really new guys flying with your right seat

2078
02:14:42.90 --> 02:14:49.14
On May 4th 1969 two aircraft from our sister company company be joined information with the second aircraft in a right echelon

2079
02:14:49.94 --> 02:14:54.42
To the first the second aircraft attempted to pass the first aircraft on his right side

2080
02:14:54.42 --> 02:15:00.82
There was a miscommunication between the two aircraft resulting in a mid air collision all crew members on both aircraft were killed

2081
02:15:00.82 --> 02:15:03.22
Yeah, yeah, when you flew formation

2082
02:15:04.42 --> 02:15:06.42
You flew at my SOP

2083
02:15:06.42 --> 02:15:13.30
But if you were gonna do something outside of the the normal formation flying like trying to pass somebody on the opposite side

2084
02:15:13.46 --> 02:15:15.38
You had to be sure and communicate with them

2085
02:15:15.38 --> 02:15:22.34
So that everybody understand what you're gonna do and evidently there was a lack of communications with these two guys and one flew right into the other

2086
02:15:24.50 --> 02:15:25.78
You know

2087
02:15:25.78 --> 02:15:32.42
You had to worry about getting shot at you had to worry about the aircraft maintenance failure and you had to worry about somebody flying into you

2088
02:15:32.42 --> 02:15:36.02
Yeah, I was telling you earlier that

2089
02:15:37.22 --> 02:15:41.14
Pilot was never really my kind of thing like I have no desire to be a pilot

2090
02:15:41.14 --> 02:15:43.78
That's one that's like couple the reasons right there

2091
02:15:43.78 --> 02:15:47.86
I like relying on some big big machine with a bunch of parts that I don't understand

2092
02:15:47.86 --> 02:15:52.90
That's gonna keep me alive and keep my friends alive. I'll like that if it was just a matter of trusting each other

2093
02:15:52.90 --> 02:15:57.22
Yeah, I I trusted a hundred percent the guys in our unit that I flew with

2094
02:15:58.18 --> 02:16:01.22
90 percent the guys in other units I didn't fly with

2095
02:16:01.94 --> 02:16:06.74
So but you had that trust and bond built up amongst you know you all went to the same flight school

2096
02:16:06.74 --> 02:16:12.74
You all understood about what what the different formations were and so you didn't do anything radical and even when we would fly

2097
02:16:12.74 --> 02:16:16.66
You know our company would fly out there company because we all flew by an SOP

2098
02:16:17.94 --> 02:16:22.34
We had a system we understood the system and so things were relatively safe

2099
02:16:22.34 --> 02:16:27.38
It's when somebody would go do something like this that's out of the ordinary that that people got killed

2100
02:16:28.26 --> 02:16:33.62
Yeah, and this is because everyone's relying on each other so much. I mean it's similar in the sealed teams if somebody

2101
02:16:34.82 --> 02:16:36.82
If somebody's outside

2102
02:16:38.10 --> 02:16:43.54
It's if the job is outside their capability like it's a non-starger that's why I like what what I like

2103
02:16:43.54 --> 02:16:48.42
What you guys had with the with the AC in order to be an aircraft commander

2104
02:16:48.42 --> 02:16:50.42
You had to get the thumbs up from the other ACs

2105
02:16:50.42 --> 02:16:56.50
There's a standard there that you can't compromise because it's truly putting everyone else at risk. That's right everybody

2106
02:16:59.30 --> 02:17:01.30
Fast forward a little bit

2107
02:17:01.30 --> 02:17:05.70
Coming around the end of the valley I climbed up the ridge and popped up looking south right down the runway

2108
02:17:05.70 --> 02:17:09.14
This is just out on another freaking mission. What you're doing all the time. There's a sniffer mission

2109
02:17:09.78 --> 02:17:15.62
On the on the left specialist linemen started shooting the sniffer team let loose with a 40 millimeter round

2110
02:17:15.62 --> 02:17:22.82
I'm not under the bamboo canopy on the edge of the runway was a regular village of NVA soldiers lying around somewhere in uniform

2111
02:17:23.06 --> 02:17:27.70
Some lying in hammocks some cooking chow tables were made out of bamboo as were chairs

2112
02:17:27.78 --> 02:17:32.18
They were totally surprised as were we and this is there they're occupying a

2113
02:17:32.58 --> 02:17:37.30
Abandoned airfield. Yeah, so that's why you see an airfield and there's an NVA right there

2114
02:17:38.02 --> 02:17:43.54
Low-vo on my left in the bamboo fire I screamed as I increased power in airspeed rapidly staying low to the ground

2115
02:17:43.54 --> 02:17:51.70
I had never seen so many enemy soldiers before as soon as I spoke 2.75 inch rockets were slamming into the bamboo and as NVA troops

2116
02:17:51.94 --> 02:17:55.14
Ran and dove for cover low-vo was firing ripple effect

2117
02:17:55.38 --> 02:18:00.18
Automatically launching 28 rockets would just one pole to trigger and punching the target

2118
02:18:00.18 --> 02:18:06.66
Then as many gun opened on the tree line on my left as we were hauling ass down the runway as we cleared the abandoned

2119
02:18:06.66 --> 02:18:12.90
SF camp and runway we stayed low level until we were confident we could climb to altitude and knock at hit by a 51

2120
02:18:12.90 --> 02:18:19.94
Cal Machine gun but something wasn't right and in the field of the aircraft the cyclic felt stiff and was getting

2121
02:18:20.02 --> 02:18:24.98
Stiffer Mr. Corey we have a problem the housing for the push pole to be shot away and each time you move the

2122
02:18:25.38 --> 02:18:31.30
Cyclic control it's binding the rods can you fix it? I was surprised at how calm I sounded when I was

2123
02:18:31.30 --> 02:18:36.34
Shitting bricks here no sir. I could hold up the tubes, but then I would be flying the aircraft from here

2124
02:18:36.34 --> 02:18:38.18
He said well, what do you suggest?

2125
02:18:38.18 --> 02:18:45.78
Slowly descend and find a clear area that we can do a running landing into you might be able to rate raise the nose, but it will be a one-time move

2126
02:18:46.26 --> 02:18:52.90
Not to be countered by attempting to lower the nose. Okay, I can do this running landings were practiced and the further south

2127
02:18:52.90 --> 02:19:00.66
I flew the better terrain for this a runway would be nice, but the closest was song bay and it was laid out East to West

2128
02:19:00.66 --> 02:19:06.02
Whereas I was flying north to south that ain't going to work guys start looking for an open area what about the road?

2129
02:19:06.02 --> 02:19:08.02
Bruce said he was now

2130
02:19:08.02 --> 02:19:13.70
On his third cigarette since I'd taken the controls damn he better save a couple for me. I thought in the distance

2131
02:19:13.70 --> 02:19:17.86
We could see a straight stretch, but the trees were close and the sides were lined with bamboo

2132
02:19:18.02 --> 02:19:25.78
It's gonna have to do I want everyone up forward and seat belts on linemen make sure everyone is strapped in tight as I got to treetop level with the road

2133
02:19:26.34 --> 02:19:32.58
Under the chin bubble. I started easing up on the I started easing the nose up slowly the air speed began to bleed off

2134
02:19:32.58 --> 02:19:40.18
89 70 not 60 knots and our speed continued to drop we were slapping the tops of bamboo stocks now 20 knots

2135
02:19:40.50 --> 02:19:43.62
Bamboo stocks were breaking off and I could feel the main roader

2136
02:19:44.10 --> 02:19:46.10
Buffeting as we hit thicker vegetation

2137
02:19:46.10 --> 02:19:52.66
I just didn't want to know what kind of vegetation at this point just don't let us hit a hardwood tree trunk and rip the rotor head off

2138
02:19:53.06 --> 02:19:56.10
At 20 knots the skids touched the ground and we're sliding along

2139
02:19:56.10 --> 02:20:04.26
Steering with the pedals to maintain a straight line broken bamboo was whirling about as if it was in a tornado as the aircraft came to a stop

2140
02:20:04.26 --> 02:20:10.34
I was shutting the engine down while linemen and Dietrich had the guns in hand with belts of ammo in their arms and

2141
02:20:10.90 --> 02:20:14.34
And we were unassing the aircraft as Mike landed right behind me

2142
02:20:14.50 --> 02:20:23.38
He didn't worry about tree limbs one look at my rotor blades told him that I'd cleared out everything for him as if a giant lawnmower had passed over the bamboo field as

2143
02:20:23.38 --> 02:20:28.74
Mike flew us back to Song Bay Dietrich had asked the question that I knew was coming

2144
02:20:28.98 --> 02:20:34.26
Hey Mr. Sinky was at your first time shot down Bruce walked into a yeah, I've only been in country a couple months

2145
02:20:34.42 --> 02:20:37.46
Thank you sir. You're buying the beard and night. I considered it

2146
02:20:37.78 --> 02:20:44.82
I considered if I should speak up as well as it was my first then Mike spoke up hey Mr. Corey that's your first two, isn't it?

2147
02:20:45.62 --> 02:20:50.26
There'll be lots of free beard tonight guys. I started to protest but to know a veil

2148
02:20:50.26 --> 02:20:53.70
Yeah, yep, yep, yep, they took a we took one round

2149
02:20:54.74 --> 02:21:00.66
And it's all it hit us, but it hit right on the housing for the the push pull to for the for the slide click

2150
02:21:01.14 --> 02:21:05.30
So every time I move that cycle I can feel it's starting to bind up I didn't dare

2151
02:21:05.30 --> 02:21:12.26
Try to move it left or right because I you know, I did not want the aircraft in a turn and it just so I just get moving it forward and back

2152
02:21:12.26 --> 02:21:19.70
And finally we just found a straight stretch of rodent said okay, let's let's go down the road and we practice running landings all the time

2153
02:21:19.70 --> 02:21:25.78
So that was no big deal. I was just worried that I wasn't gonna get that nose far enough back up to slow the aircraft down

2154
02:21:25.78 --> 02:21:27.78
Now last thing I want to is what you're doing

2155
02:21:27.78 --> 02:21:30.02
60 not sliding down that road and my skids

2156
02:21:31.06 --> 02:21:37.14
So making sure we had enough room to ease that nose up and keep that aircraft and sliding too fast

2157
02:21:37.14 --> 02:21:43.54
But yeah Mike Mike saw a good at he heard the Mayday logo put out a Mayday for me as well and

2158
02:21:44.42 --> 02:21:50.26
They got in four hours later. She knew came in pick the aircraft up and flew it back to like A and yeah

2159
02:21:50.26 --> 02:21:57.78
That's what's crazy you these helicopters you get shot down and you just leave the bird and then a CH 40 47 would come in

2160
02:21:58.10 --> 02:22:03.54
Strap on to the thing and take it on well what happened is that a bird would go down and first in the night's calf

2161
02:22:03.54 --> 02:22:08.90
They always had a rapid reaction force this called their blues and they would fly in that rapid reaction force

2162
02:22:08.90 --> 02:22:15.68
Into where the aircraft was if it was salvageable set security yet set security and then they'd hooked the the aircraft up to a CH

2163
02:22:15.68 --> 02:22:19.44
47 and 47 would pull the aircraft out and fly it back to its own base and

2164
02:22:19.66 --> 02:22:25.90
That's all they did with this one. They replaced the rotor blades. They replaced the bell housing on the bottom and that was it two days later

2165
02:22:25.90 --> 02:22:27.90
That bird was back up and flying again

2166
02:22:27.90 --> 02:22:32.30
Now when you did you get that you stand your own bird

2167
02:22:32.86 --> 02:22:38.14
The like all the time or you always find the same bird. Yes, unless it's down for maintenance for some reasons

2168
02:22:38.14 --> 02:22:42.74
So you get some other random bird are all the birds a little bit different now. They were pretty much laid out the same

2169
02:22:42.74 --> 02:22:43.74
I mean

2170
02:22:43.74 --> 02:22:46.38
There were little corpse about them, but nothing that you'd really notice

2171
02:22:48.10 --> 02:22:50.10
We had we had

2172
02:22:50.94 --> 02:22:57.30
Outboard motors right for our zodiac boats. Yeah, and they even though they're all from the same company

2173
02:22:57.30 --> 02:22:59.14
They're all supposed to like we had names form

2174
02:22:59.14 --> 02:23:02.22
You know and they would all be just a little bit different

2175
02:23:03.42 --> 02:23:09.14
Temperamental ten for mental like there's one I remember it's called Frankenstein. It was like the one that was it was all

2176
02:23:09.54 --> 02:23:12.10
It looked like it would never run, but it was the most reliable

2177
02:23:12.74 --> 02:23:18.22
But you but it's but for you you didn't care if you got a different bird other than hard luck

2178
02:23:18.50 --> 02:23:20.78
Yeah, yeah, I didn't care we'd fly anything

2179
02:23:21.42 --> 02:23:24.14
What you didn't like though is you got a different crew chief

2180
02:23:24.14 --> 02:23:29.34
You always got a different crew chief in a different gunner because the crew chief and gunner always stayed with their aircraft

2181
02:23:29.34 --> 02:23:30.82
Their aircraft was now from maintenance

2182
02:23:30.82 --> 02:23:34.06
They were down from maintenance as well helping them get the aircraft ready

2183
02:23:34.06 --> 02:23:38.38
So that's the only thing I didn't like about is I had to learn different crew chiefs in different gunners, but

2184
02:23:38.90 --> 02:23:41.90
Otherwise, yeah, it's the aircraft were pretty much the same enough

2185
02:23:42.38 --> 02:23:49.58
Are you so you're flying this is analog flying right? I mean this is you're moving the stick and it's moving a piece of

2186
02:23:49.58 --> 02:23:55.22
Whatever cable that's moving something it's moving a tube it's moving a tube but that's what it is

2187
02:23:55.22 --> 02:23:56.22
So this

2188
02:23:56.22 --> 02:23:59.42
our is a black hawk the same thing is a black hawk

2189
02:24:00.06 --> 02:24:03.56
Is it is it analog like that where you're actually moving a

2190
02:24:03.98 --> 02:24:09.10
Gear somewhere or moving a cable or moving a tube I think so I'm not sure about the black hawk

2191
02:24:09.62 --> 02:24:17.66
But on the Huey it was always tubes the only place you had cables was back in the back in the tail boom and that was a cable two cables

2192
02:24:17.66 --> 02:24:24.14
Two or four I can't remember I think it was two cables that ran down the tail boom back to the tail rotor

2193
02:24:24.54 --> 02:24:30.50
But for the for the cyclic the collective and the pedals initially those were all push pull tubes

2194
02:24:30.50 --> 02:24:35.66
They were called but it's all mechanical it's all mechanical. They know there's is there anything like

2195
02:24:36.38 --> 02:24:42.14
Power steering the only thing that was that was the governor the fuel on the the Huey

2196
02:24:42.14 --> 02:24:48.46
There was control the throttle was controlled by a governor so once you started the aircraft up you brought the throttle up all the way

2197
02:24:48.46 --> 02:24:51.02
And the governor would stop at at

2198
02:24:51.34 --> 02:24:55.26
6600 RPM on the engine and you had a governor control switch

2199
02:24:56.14 --> 02:25:00.06
If that went out then you had to fly the aircraft manually and

2200
02:25:01.10 --> 02:25:04.62
You learned how to fly it manually with the TH55 and flight school

2201
02:25:04.62 --> 02:25:11.66
But on the Huey that was really sensitive with that trying to fly that thing with the manual control on the throttle

2202
02:25:11.82 --> 02:25:16.70
But that's the only thing that was automatic so to speak on the Huey was that throttle control man

2203
02:25:16.70 --> 02:25:18.70
These are some like durable

2204
02:25:19.58 --> 02:25:22.46
Beasts oh they were the Huey the cober gunship

2205
02:25:23.42 --> 02:25:31.98
The charlotte old Charlie model gunships they were just great. I mean bell helicopter built a great aircraft force and it did well the

2206
02:25:31.98 --> 02:25:41.58
Hue's built the OH6 which you see those with the MH6 is now in the in task force 160 the OH6

2207
02:25:42.30 --> 02:25:45.34
Guys love the fly that thing because if it got shot down

2208
02:25:46.30 --> 02:25:50.14
It would crash the road ahead come off the tail boom come off and it rolled like an egg

2209
02:25:50.14 --> 02:26:01.98
And so guys really they they didn't mind well they did mind getting shot down crashing but their survivability rate was really good in the OH6

2210
02:26:02.62 --> 02:26:03.90
All right

2211
02:26:04.62 --> 02:26:06.94
Going back to the book here you take some leave and

2212
02:26:08.30 --> 02:26:13.10
And while you're on leave you know you got it what you got DC Baltimore area DC yeah

2213
02:26:13.10 --> 02:26:18.38
Mama's mama's going to college at the University of Maryland and then

2214
02:26:18.38 --> 02:26:23.90
You know you you spend some time with with Mary is that right yeah

2215
02:26:24.86 --> 02:26:28.14
Spend some time with Mary get to know her and then

2216
02:26:29.02 --> 02:26:34.70
Let me give you some background Mary what's here about Mary I'm that Mary dad was stationed in Morocco

2217
02:26:35.58 --> 02:26:38.22
You're that my dad and 60

2218
02:26:39.58 --> 02:26:41.58
seven

2219
02:26:41.58 --> 02:26:44.94
Yeah, and I went back to Morocco

2220
02:26:44.94 --> 02:26:47.66
So for Christmas of 67

2221
02:26:49.58 --> 02:26:57.58
Met Mary one night in church in Morocco in Morocco there what was her parents doing they were stationed at the same navy base it was a communications base

2222
02:26:57.90 --> 02:27:00.54
So she's another navy brand navy brand and

2223
02:27:01.58 --> 02:27:07.26
The base is no longer there it was at city i.e. outside of canetra but in that her church

2224
02:27:08.38 --> 02:27:13.98
We went out for a ride my dad's mg the next day and that was it and then a year later just for him

2225
02:27:13.98 --> 02:27:19.42
Went to Vietnam I came back and met her parents you know so our parents and everything she'd already gone back to the states

2226
02:27:20.14 --> 02:27:23.10
And so when I came back from Vietnam the first time

2227
02:27:23.10 --> 02:27:25.10
You know all the way to Morocco and Mary

2228
02:27:25.90 --> 02:27:32.86
Right there and so so I came back to the states and mom said hey why don't you get out and see the Simmons

2229
02:27:33.42 --> 02:27:37.50
And and I said yeah, we used to live in Virginia Beach with the devastation on the cobblers

2230
02:27:38.30 --> 02:27:41.98
SS 344 so I thought yeah, they'd be kind of cool I like to go back and see an office

2231
02:27:41.98 --> 02:27:44.94
So I went down there and met her and we got kind of hooked up then and

2232
02:27:46.30 --> 02:27:51.10
That was that was a while you were on leave yeah, that's why I was on my extension leaf got it

2233
02:27:52.62 --> 02:28:00.06
So that's really you don't kind of a mission accomplished there yeah, yeah, the states side mission accomplished you you come back from leave

2234
02:28:01.98 --> 02:28:05.10
And you you mentioned that you were ready to go back from leave you were ready to go back to normal

2235
02:28:05.10 --> 02:28:08.54
Yeah, I was ready to get back. I just I was climbing the walls a little bit

2236
02:28:08.54 --> 02:28:10.54
Um

2237
02:28:11.10 --> 02:28:16.94
You get back their hair red in the paper and DC that an aircraft went down was it one of ours no one said anything

2238
02:28:16.94 --> 02:28:19.58
But everyone looked uncomfortable finally someone spoke up

2239
02:28:20.78 --> 02:28:26.30
Yeah, it was one of us that was all you would say well who was it did the crew get out everyone?

2240
02:28:26.30 --> 02:28:29.26
Okay, it was your aircraft one nine

2241
02:28:30.06 --> 02:28:32.06
No one got out

2242
02:28:32.06 --> 02:28:35.90
What what the what happened? I asked I was in total shop shock

2243
02:28:35.90 --> 02:28:42.62
They were on a resupply over a hoverhole the gooks open fire on them on their third pass and they crashed into the trees

2244
02:28:42.94 --> 02:28:47.26
Grunt said that they made each of their three approaches over the same ground

2245
02:28:47.42 --> 02:28:53.90
They had five new replacements on board the grunts got to the aircraft and we're shooting gooks in the cabin and a cockpit

2246
02:28:54.38 --> 02:29:00.54
Who was the crew it was ash as AC and a newbie Taylor your crew chief linemen

2247
02:29:00.54 --> 02:29:05.42
Linem is that any says name? Linnem and Dichrick were on board two

2248
02:29:06.70 --> 02:29:13.34
Sorry they told me I didn't know the copilot who had arrived the day after I'd left to go home the AC like all

2249
02:29:13.34 --> 02:29:19.42
Our guys was a good man. He had just received a deer John letter from his wife telling him she was getting a divorce

2250
02:29:19.98 --> 02:29:21.98
I guess she didn't need to know

2251
02:29:21.98 --> 02:29:26.78
But he guess she didn't need to now. I raised my glass and they joined me to apps and comrades

2252
02:29:26.78 --> 02:29:32.14
So the guys Linnem and Dichrick who you just went through that

2253
02:29:33.26 --> 02:29:38.62
Is that called a crash landing what you do? Yeah, you went through that crash line landing you go home and both those guys get killed

2254
02:29:38.62 --> 02:29:42.30
Yeah, and the thing that struck me was that here. I'm in Washington DC

2255
02:29:42.70 --> 02:29:47.02
I'm reading the paper in the morning and it's talking about this helicopter shut down a hundred miles north of Saigon

2256
02:29:47.02 --> 02:29:51.74
I'm thinking what's so unusual about that? I mean helicopters getting shut down all the time and Vietnam

2257
02:29:51.98 --> 02:29:55.98
And I just it just kind of struck me odd that that would be there and then I get there

2258
02:29:55.98 --> 02:29:57.98
And I find out it was my own aircraft

2259
02:30:03.18 --> 02:30:09.74
There's a chapter in here called stand down and it really points out the the importance of

2260
02:30:11.26 --> 02:30:13.50
Crew rest you guys were run ragged

2261
02:30:13.50 --> 02:30:18.54
We're running you go through one point where you you're in a helicopter helicopter flying you wake up

2262
02:30:19.10 --> 02:30:24.62
Yeah, and you see that the the person well I guess it's the lead pilot my coat pilot is also asleep

2263
02:30:24.62 --> 02:30:27.18
Yeah, and the cruisest leap yeah that happened

2264
02:30:27.50 --> 02:30:31.26
We had a policy it got to the point where you know earlier you said in the book you know if you had

2265
02:30:31.26 --> 02:30:33.50
140 hours you got a couple of days down

2266
02:30:34.06 --> 02:30:36.54
I was pushing over 160 hours and

2267
02:30:37.10 --> 02:30:40.94
It got to the point where most of the pilots were the same boat. We were shorter pilots

2268
02:30:42.54 --> 02:30:44.54
We were training our crew chiefs

2269
02:30:44.54 --> 02:30:47.18
To fly the aircraft because it was getting that desperate

2270
02:30:47.58 --> 02:30:51.02
So what we did was if we were flying a long leg

2271
02:30:51.02 --> 02:30:55.18
One pilot would sleep the other would stay awake and so that's what we were doing

2272
02:30:55.18 --> 02:30:58.54
Well, he was flying where come back at night beautiful night to fly

2273
02:30:59.58 --> 02:31:02.62
And I told him said I'm gonna I'm gonna catch some sleep. He said okay

2274
02:31:02.94 --> 02:31:07.10
So I close my eyes and ride away fell asleep. Well something told me to wake up

2275
02:31:07.66 --> 02:31:14.78
And I kind of woke up and looked around and it may have been a one of the first indications of a problem is a change in sound in the aircraft

2276
02:31:16.46 --> 02:31:19.34
You know if suddenly the engine's quiet you know you got a problem

2277
02:31:19.34 --> 02:31:25.50
But there was just you really listened to sound in the aircraft and that would that would tell you something's wrong a whistling sound

2278
02:31:25.50 --> 02:31:27.50
It you just got a bullet through the road of blades

2279
02:31:28.70 --> 02:31:34.38
So something just woke me up and I just sat there and just kind of looked around everything looked great and I looked over at him

2280
02:31:34.78 --> 02:31:40.06
And I thought what did he just looking at his head was down and then I realized he's asleep

2281
02:31:40.62 --> 02:31:46.70
And we just sat there and the aircraft was flying long perfect and then she just and I suspect what happened is that

2282
02:31:46.70 --> 02:31:53.42
He probably just let a little pressure off his hand and the cyclic just ease forward a bit because the no-star dropping

2283
02:31:53.42 --> 02:32:00.06
We started picking up speed and pick up speed sounds gonna change the aircraft started vibrate and then he walked up and looked over it

2284
02:32:00.06 --> 02:32:02.06
Me and I went you had a nice nap

2285
02:32:02.06 --> 02:32:08.26
So yeah, we got back in that night and the medical officer came out and they stood the whole unit down

2286
02:32:08.26 --> 02:32:14.38
Because I was the third aircraft come in that day and the other two aircraft came in and piloted both declared that's it

2287
02:32:14.38 --> 02:32:19.18
We're done so the medical officer came out when the company commander came out and they ground it the whole unit

2288
02:32:21.90 --> 02:32:28.94
You guys end up getting a valourist unit award. Yes, yes, we got a valourist unit for the action on six March

2289
02:32:29.98 --> 02:32:31.98
69

2290
02:32:31.98 --> 02:32:37.98
um

2291
02:32:40.06 --> 02:32:42.06
Here's another thing that happens

2292
02:32:42.78 --> 02:32:48.14
You're in for a briefing mr. Corey you and I will have three lifts tomorrow and that should about do it mr. Roberts

2293
02:32:48.14 --> 02:32:53.74
You and I will fly to the day after tomorrow sir mr. Roberts responded looking at me and I at him

2294
02:32:54.30 --> 02:32:59.82
You two are gonna be the next flight leaders the policy about worn officers not being flight leaders has changed

2295
02:32:59.82 --> 02:33:06.70
You will be first if you guys want the assignment all the warrants in the room were smiling and talking softly my platoon leader was smiling

2296
02:33:06.70 --> 02:33:10.94
And while captain weed wasn't he didn't protest noted any the commission officers

2297
02:33:10.94 --> 02:33:15.82
I never knew if the major had spoken with them before the meeting or not. Yes, sir. I'll take it

2298
02:33:16.46 --> 02:33:23.26
So you you alluded to that earlier where the real the real life officers with the only ones that could be flight leads

2299
02:33:23.26 --> 02:33:26.62
Yeah, and now like you were saying you're so underman that

2300
02:33:26.62 --> 02:33:30.86
They opened it up and you and one of their guy get to be the first

2301
02:33:31.50 --> 02:33:35.82
Warrants or flight leads. Yes, they changed the policy because we're just we're so short of officers

2302
02:33:36.54 --> 02:33:37.90
of

2303
02:33:37.90 --> 02:33:39.90
We didn't have any experienced officers

2304
02:33:40.30 --> 02:33:45.50
That were ready to take over flight lead position so the company commander he went to the brigade commander and say hey

2305
02:33:45.66 --> 02:33:49.98
We got to start letting the experienced warrants, you know, he said I got I got two warrants that are over

2306
02:33:49.98 --> 02:33:56.38
Over 12 months in the unit and these guys know what they're doing you got to you got to open the policy up in the brigade commander

2307
02:33:57.10 --> 02:33:59.34
Colonel suit check really a good guy

2308
02:34:00.06 --> 02:34:02.06
He's he's absolutely open it up

2309
02:34:02.22 --> 02:34:07.82
So you said you were training some of their crew chiefs to become pilots and I never make that transition while you're in Vietnam

2310
02:34:07.82 --> 02:34:13.90
Oh, yeah, they could they could they could we would train them sufficiently to land the aircraft not hover or running landing

2311
02:34:14.30 --> 02:34:16.54
But we always felt that you know if somebody got shot

2312
02:34:16.54 --> 02:34:22.46
I have both pilots got wounded somebody's gonna have to bring this bird back so we would train the crew chiefs to do running landings

2313
02:34:23.02 --> 02:34:27.98
My crew chief was pretty darn good at it and one crew chief. I think it was Grossman

2314
02:34:29.18 --> 02:34:33.10
He came back and went to flight school and graduated with flight school and came back to the office of pilot

2315
02:34:37.50 --> 02:34:40.62
Here we go another mission and look I'm covering a

2316
02:34:40.62 --> 02:34:46.78
Tiny percentage of this book and just trying to figure out which one of these freaking crazy missions to highlight

2317
02:34:48.30 --> 02:34:52.22
Just it's like throwing it's like a roll the dice to pick one they're all they're all nuts

2318
02:34:52.46 --> 02:34:58.06
Here's one at H minus one the door gunners open fire concentrating on the tree line as we touched down the grunt started

2319
02:34:58.62 --> 02:35:04.94
off the aircraft that was when a sledgehammer hit the side of the aircraft one two times and then I lost count

2320
02:35:04.94 --> 02:35:11.42
The engine started winding down the rotor RPM started dropping as the engine RPM went to zero

2321
02:35:11.58 --> 02:35:13.42
We're taking fire screamed Peters

2322
02:35:13.42 --> 02:35:19.50
It was on his side of the aircraft and it was concentrated on our engine his gun was ripping through ammunition get out

2323
02:35:19.50 --> 02:35:22.66
I yelled and we began unassing the aircraft

2324
02:35:22.66 --> 02:35:26.78
Talk to is leading the rest of the flight out. We were now on the ground with the grunts

2325
02:35:27.18 --> 02:35:33.68
Peters was on his M60 machine gun and I told him to get down no need for him to sit in the gunners position and be a target to his credit

2326
02:35:33.68 --> 02:35:36.88
He did and took his gun with him dragging ammo as well

2327
02:35:37.04 --> 02:35:43.76
Specialist love lace was doing the same the code was were coming in around for a second pass and using the remaining rockets and 40 millimeter ammo

2328
02:35:43.76 --> 02:35:50.64
That they had rattle or six was on the ground next to me and began calling for artillery support as the second flight crew

2329
02:35:50.88 --> 02:35:57.28
Flight came into view the artillery silence and the anti aircraft gun that had worked us over as well as the small arms fire

2330
02:35:57.28 --> 02:35:59.12
That was coming from the trees

2331
02:35:59.12 --> 02:36:03.12
We remained in the LZ until the third lift and jumped on an aircraft to get out

2332
02:36:03.12 --> 02:36:10.56
Already the battalion commander notified brigade that an aircraft was down in the LZ a recovery team was getting ready to come and get the aircraft and fly it

2333
02:36:10.80 --> 02:36:17.04
Fly it back under our CH 47 a new engine would be installed that night and that aircraft would be flying in the morning

2334
02:36:17.04 --> 02:36:17.84
hopefully

2335
02:36:17.84 --> 02:36:22.48
Flying back love lace turned to me damn Mr. Corey your psychic with your feelings

2336
02:36:23.68 --> 02:36:28.88
And that's something I kind of skipped over you have a whole whole chapter that's called psychic so you had some kind of

2337
02:36:29.20 --> 02:36:31.20
Whatever six cents about

2338
02:36:31.20 --> 02:36:34.16
I don't think things are gonna go well. I

2339
02:36:35.28 --> 02:36:42.72
The first the first time I happened I went out to the aircraft one day and just didn't have a good feeling

2340
02:36:45.28 --> 02:36:47.28
Got got shot up bad that day and

2341
02:36:49.60 --> 02:36:52.56
It happened this a second time third time I came out to the aircraft

2342
02:36:52.56 --> 02:36:56.72
I asked love lace. I said hey how's the aircraft today? He goes you got your feeling don't you?

2343
02:36:56.72 --> 02:37:03.76
And I kind of lied nice I find it. Yeah, I just it's gonna be okay guys. I just got a strange feeling that strange feeling hit me six times

2344
02:37:04.16 --> 02:37:09.44
And it just I would go out to the aircraft and I would just have this feeling of dread for that day and

2345
02:37:09.68 --> 02:37:13.68
Low in the whole would get hit and I just think I'm a believer in

2346
02:37:14.24 --> 02:37:16.80
The supernatural and my patron saint is saint the

2347
02:37:17.20 --> 02:37:22.24
Padre Pio and I just think Padre Pio was was watching over me. He blessed me when I was a little kid and

2348
02:37:22.24 --> 02:37:26.80
I think he was just watching over me saying hey be careful

2349
02:37:27.28 --> 02:37:32.88
So okay, well, it's gonna ask you like what I appreciate you Saint Pio

2350
02:37:33.20 --> 02:37:36.40
But just let me know that I'm gonna get shot off. I need a little bit more than that

2351
02:37:37.20 --> 02:37:39.20
Just let me know it's like gonna hit me

2352
02:37:41.20 --> 02:37:47.84
That's so so six times you had that feeling yeah, and each time you had that feeling we got we got a little them living day like shot out of us

2353
02:37:47.84 --> 02:37:52.40
Didn't lose anybody you ever have the feeling and it didn't and it didn't happen. Yeah, yeah

2354
02:37:53.12 --> 02:38:01.36
I had a guy I had a guy named Johnny and the great guy, but man every time we rolled out he thought he was we were all gonna die

2355
02:38:03.12 --> 02:38:06.48
Every time he'd go he'd he smoked chain smoke. He said

2356
02:38:07.20 --> 02:38:12.72
He go it can I tonight sir I can feel it this one you ready you ready because it's coming every night

2357
02:38:12.72 --> 02:38:15.28
It didn't matter what we were doing little logistics run. He goes

2358
02:38:15.28 --> 02:38:18.40
I'm gonna bat feeling about this one boss

2359
02:38:18.40 --> 02:38:22.40
This is coming you're like this chocolate you like where this is going like okay

2360
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:25.36
So I had to take that and it's right I didn't have Saint Pio I had

2361
02:38:25.92 --> 02:38:27.76
Saint John and John wrong gonna die

2362
02:38:28.32 --> 02:38:32.64
We had I knew what that guy went out on every single mission and as a matter of fact

2363
02:38:33.28 --> 02:38:35.28
This is on my first deployment to Iraq and

2364
02:38:35.84 --> 02:38:38.32
Our senior in my senior in listed advisor

2365
02:38:38.88 --> 02:38:43.20
Said hey man you gotta get you know get Johnny out of here man get him on the first because you know it takes

2366
02:38:43.20 --> 02:38:45.36
It takes a couple weeks to get everyone flown home

2367
02:38:46.08 --> 02:38:51.52
And I said I said he said hey you got it you know get talk to Johnny get him on that first bird out of here man

2368
02:38:51.52 --> 02:38:55.68
He's gonna you know he's he's he's losing it and I got he's not gonna want to leave and he goes

2369
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:00.88
He goes you need to you need to get him on a plane and I said I'm not gonna put him on a plane

2370
02:39:00.88 --> 02:39:03.92
He's not gonna want to leave and he goes well just ask him and I go

2371
02:39:04.40 --> 02:39:10.40
All right fine I'll ask him so I go up the Johnny one day and I said I said hey John and you know the first first planes are heading home

2372
02:39:10.40 --> 02:39:14.88
You want to be you want me get your seat on that plane you go fuck you

2373
02:39:16.40 --> 02:39:23.04
I was like Roger that just checking it's your enough you all last bird home, you know like he he was you was paranoid

2374
02:39:23.36 --> 02:39:26.24
But he was doing his job and didn't want to go home we had a

2375
02:39:26.88 --> 02:39:29.20
We had a war and officer that come into the unit and

2376
02:39:30.08 --> 02:39:31.60
He flew

2377
02:39:31.60 --> 02:39:36.08
Made aircraft commander and never flew a combat mission after that as your aircraft commander

2378
02:39:36.08 --> 02:39:42.88
He would he would take the aircraft out and within 30 minutes you know he'd be coming back in complaining about something wrong with the aircraft

2379
02:39:43.28 --> 02:39:49.44
And five they made him an assistant to ops officer and he served as a systems ops officer, but he never flew a combat mission again

2380
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.08
Yeah, he just I would say he had a yellow streak he didn't have bad feeling he had yellow streak

2381
02:39:56.08 --> 02:40:06.56
That's the difference Johnny had that bad feeling all time, but no yellow streak there he was ready to rock and roll

2382
02:40:08.72 --> 02:40:10.32
Another one on April 30th

2383
02:40:11.92 --> 02:40:13.52
Arvan forces

2384
02:40:13.52 --> 02:40:17.84

02:41:41.76 --> 02:41:47.60
the invasion of Cambodia didn't didn't know what was coming the night before

2400
02:41:49.68 --> 02:41:55.12
I got called into the company commanders office me and Reynolds and a couple of the two leaders and

2401
02:41:57.04 --> 02:41:57.68

2402
02:41:58.88 --> 02:42:01.04
he poured eight drinks Scotch

2403
02:42:02.16 --> 02:42:07.04
we're all sitting there looking each other like what else is and how many of them was here there's about eight of us

2410
02:42:38.24 --> 02:42:44.64

2418
02:43:28.40 --> 02:43:33.84
baton commander shows up he takes map board he throws them canves over the map board and says gentlemen

2419
02:43:34.40 --> 02:43:39.36
we're in Vaton Cambodia the crew chiefs a crew chiefs in the darkness all got up and left

2420
02:43:39.36 --> 02:43:44.32
and went back and started cleaning guns and cleaning ammo right away and we did we picked up an

2421
02:43:44.32 --> 02:43:50.80
arvin force and we flew three top level uh baton commander was at 3000 feet and he was navigating

2422
02:43:51.44 --> 02:43:56.96
telling chalk one what his heading wasn't set her and directing the artillery and the cobras

2423
02:43:56.96 --> 02:44:03.68
and we flew it about oh maybe 200 feet above the trees and punched across the border as we went

2424
02:44:03.68 --> 02:44:10.48
across the border there was a road parallel at the border look down there's guy NVA and their

2425
02:44:10.48 --> 02:44:14.80
khaki uniforms as far as you could see down the road both sides of the roads sling arms

2426
02:44:14.80 --> 02:44:18.72
and they're just standing there kind of shocked at all these aircraft are passing over them

2427
02:44:19.36 --> 02:44:24.88
went in hit the landing zone picked up didn't take any fire going in we thought no this is great

2428
02:44:24.88 --> 02:44:29.84
took a lot of fire coming back out across that road but uh that was the first day at the Cambodian

2429
02:44:29.84 --> 02:44:35.84
invasion we did three assaults at day putting Vietnamese soldiers in so he was a big day then things

2430
02:44:35.84 --> 02:44:40.88
got hot the next day next day the NVA waiting for the helicopters and we started taking a lot of hits the next

2431
02:44:40.88 --> 02:44:51.04
days it's uh it's kind of crazy I always I always kind of joke about um Hollywood and in Hollywood

2432
02:44:51.04 --> 02:44:56.08
you know they show like the platoon's about to go in and the commander shows up right as the birds

2433
02:44:56.08 --> 02:44:59.44
are spinning since our i-gence here's where you're going and here's the mission and I was

2434
02:44:59.44 --> 02:45:04.32
talking about how unrealistic that is but that's what you guys did well yeah kind of in fact I'm glad

2435
02:45:04.32 --> 02:45:11.28
you brought that up because um I've got two screenwriters and a producer right now and the screenwriters

2436
02:45:11.28 --> 02:45:15.52
are taking the three they're taking two books the first two books and they're writing a screenplay

2437
02:45:15.52 --> 02:45:22.000
and one of the things I've told them I says look guys I do not want this to be typical Hollywood

2438
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.76
and they're they're good guys a rich graph who starred in making the mob uh new york he played

2439
02:45:27.76 --> 02:45:34.56
lucky Luciano in that and uh a guy named raki carlitch and krakki owns uh ghostwalker productions

2440
02:45:34.56 --> 02:45:40.24
and then my producers Amy Soto and she's worked with John Malkovitch uh male gibbs and several of these

2441
02:45:40.24 --> 02:45:46.56
guys so there there's good crew but I told them I said I do not want this to be a typical Hollywood

2442
02:45:46.56 --> 02:45:53.68
movie and I and I've given the list of of movies to watch this is good ones and this is terrible

2443
02:45:53.68 --> 02:45:59.84
I don't want these terrible ones so we've had some some lively discussions about what will be

2444
02:45:59.84 --> 02:46:05.12
in this movie and not in this movie so but yeah Hollywood just makes it look kind of odd but uh

2445
02:46:05.12 --> 02:46:10.88
when you have an SOP you can say all right this is what we're gonna do and here's how we're gonna do it

2446
02:46:10.88 --> 02:46:15.12
and you don't take a lot of discussion with it and and some of that works out pretty well it

2447
02:46:15.12 --> 02:46:21.92
worked out for well for me for one exercise where uh found out my LZ uh the opt for uh

2448
02:46:22.88 --> 02:46:29.60
reserve was sitting on my LZ and I grabbed the the flight leaders grabbed the company commander sat

2449
02:46:29.60 --> 02:46:34.000
down pulled a poncho over our heads turned the flashlight on said okay here's your new LZs

2450
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.88
any questions no let's go so you can do that stuff if you have a system and if you have a good

2451
02:46:38.88 --> 02:46:49.52
working procedure but yeah some of the stuff that Hollywood puts out is just uh um

2452
02:46:50.32 --> 02:46:56.80
here's one made a made a dragon breath two three is bailing out and going down the

2453
02:46:56.80 --> 02:47:01.60
sanity and there's the grid coordinates you all are in the air watch the parachute go down

2454
02:47:01.60 --> 02:47:07.44
so there's a guy bailing out of one of these he's at four-year reserve so what's he in an OV-10

2455
02:47:07.44 --> 02:47:16.000
yeah he was sent yeah he no uh what was that twin tail sessna they had a push pull yeah yeah

2456
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:20.64
I don't I don't remember the normal clay tron it but it was it wasn't the OV-10 but he was in one of

2457
02:47:20.64 --> 02:47:28.24
those when he went down so the sky punches out of his aircraft and the you guys are on this

2458
02:47:28.24 --> 02:47:34.16
operation looking watching his parachute go down watch you know tracking as it goes into the jungle

2459
02:47:34.72 --> 02:47:40.80
you're flying you're looking for it and here we go as captain boa shamp slid the aircraft over

2460
02:47:40.80 --> 02:47:45.60
the pilot sergeant west informed him sir the pilot appears to be out cold he's just hanging there

2461
02:47:45.60 --> 02:47:49.92
hanging in the tree there okay we have to get him quick quick captain boa shamp said

2462
02:47:50.24 --> 02:47:54.96
surveying the ground for a place to land there wasn't one as the vegetation wasn't dense but the

2463
02:47:54.96 --> 02:48:00.000
trees were 30 feet high and close enough together that they didn't offer a clearing big enough to land in

2464
02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:05.20
west had already climbed into the cabin area and was preparing a 200 foot repel rope that was

2465
02:48:05.20 --> 02:48:11.28
maintained in the aircraft sir I can get him and with that he dropped the rope and was prepared

2466
02:48:11.28 --> 02:48:17.36
preparing to go down okay but and west was gone he'd forgotten to put gloves on and his hands were

2467
02:48:17.36 --> 02:48:22.56
paying for that mistake how am I going to get him out he said more to himself than anyone particular

2468
02:48:22.56 --> 02:48:27.84
jameson you keep an eye on him and keep him covered captain boa shamp said to the door gunner

2469
02:48:28.56 --> 02:48:34.72
dropping the 70 feet or so west sprinted to the pilot who is still unconscious and hanging in the tree

2470
02:48:34.72 --> 02:48:40.88
only a few feet off the ground small tuffs of graft grass and dirt were being kicked up around west

2471
02:48:40.88 --> 02:48:44.08
as small arms fire was directed in his direction

2472
02:48:45.60 --> 02:48:51.28
damn parachute release won't release son of a bitch dammit come on west screamed hoping the pilot would wake

2473
02:48:51.28 --> 02:48:57.52
and give him some assistance he did not got to get a knife pausing at a low crouch west waited

2474
02:48:57.52 --> 02:49:03.12
a moment before he sprinted back to the aircraft which was still at a hover engaging the NVA position

2475
02:49:03.12 --> 02:49:09.12
as he ran west made a cutting motion hoping the gunner or copilot would recognize the signal

2476
02:49:09.12 --> 02:49:14.88
and drop a knife they did picking up the knife west didn't hesitate to sprint back to the hanging pilot

2477
02:49:14.88 --> 02:49:20.96
cut him free and throw him over his shoulder just then an RPG round slammed into the tree the pilot

2478
02:49:20.96 --> 02:49:26.08
had been hanging in with the pilot over his shoulder in a fireman carry position west ran for the

2479
02:49:26.08 --> 02:49:31.44
aircraft and the dangling rope grabbing the rope he wrapped it around the pilot and himself and

2480
02:49:31.44 --> 02:49:36.80
motion for the aircraft to take off west didn't have time to tie a knot but only had the rope

2481
02:49:36.80 --> 02:49:42.32
wrapped around himself on the pilot because of his rope burned hands west couldn't climb the rope

2482
02:49:42.32 --> 02:49:47.12
but prayed he could hold on long enough to get safely back to ground as the aircraft climbed

2483
02:49:47.12 --> 02:49:52.64
out and built up some speed small arms fire continued captain boa shamp didn't fly couldn't fly

2484
02:49:52.64 --> 02:49:57.52
with any speed as the drag on west in the pilot would be too great and pull them off the rope

2485
02:49:57.52 --> 02:50:02.48
west was dangling about 70 feet below the aircraft which was flying over the jungle at two to

2486
02:50:02.48 --> 02:50:08.64
300 feet helicopter crews did not have parachutes as west cleared the trees captain boa shamp

2487
02:50:08.64 --> 02:50:14.16
nose the aircraft over and began picking up speed all the wild praying west didn't fall everyone

2488
02:50:14.16 --> 02:50:20.24
was well aware that if they had the an engine failure or any other emergency west in the pilot wouldn't

2489
02:50:20.24 --> 02:50:25.84
survive arriving over a clearing captain boa shamp captain boa shamp lowered the aircraft to place

2490
02:50:25.84 --> 02:50:30.96
west and the pilot on the ground and then the aircraft this was an unscured clearing only about

2491
02:50:30.96 --> 02:50:35.68
1500 meters from where they picked up the pilot detaching the rope west and jamison quickly

2492
02:50:35.68 --> 02:50:41.04
loaded the pilot into the aircraft and departed for LZ Center where the unconscious pilot was

2493
02:50:41.04 --> 02:50:47.04
quickly transferred to a meta-vac aircraft that had been requested west resumed his duties as crew chief

2494
02:50:49.44 --> 02:50:54.64
west went on to receive it was put in for the metal of honor it was downgraded to the

2495
02:50:54.64 --> 02:50:59.60
Stinger service cross and he spent 20 years in the army retired as a command sergeant major

2496
02:50:59.60 --> 02:51:09.84

02:53:54.40 --> 02:54:01.20
an aviation branch the army had they had all the other branches but we didn't have an aviation branch

2530
02:54:01.60 --> 02:54:06.24
and there were some politics involved with that with the air force and they did not form

2531
02:54:06.24 --> 02:54:13.76
the aviation branch in the army until about 1985 and at that time you had a choice if you were an

2532
02:54:13.76 --> 02:54:16.80
infantry officer if you were another branch you could decide if you're going to go the aviation

2533
02:54:16.80 --> 02:54:20.64
branch or retain the branch that you were in and I've retained the infantry branch because

2534
02:54:20.64 --> 02:54:25.92
I lost the the retina my left eye just before that so I wouldn't have been able to fly anyway so

2535
02:54:25.92 --> 02:54:36.40
I'd just stayed in the infantry so back to the book a little bit I mean so you get this commission

2536
02:54:36.40 --> 02:54:41.76
you're you're still conducting all kinds of missions I'm jumping through all kinds of missions

2537
02:54:41.76 --> 02:54:50.000
you're starting to get short meaning you're close to heading home yeah picking it up here I was

2538
02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.68
in the chalk to position and it just cleared the trees and was really paying no attention to chalk

2539
02:54:55.68 --> 02:55:01.12
three who attempted to fly between two trees and caught a rotor blade on one yeah to everyone's

2540
02:55:01.12 --> 02:55:06.000
hard the aircraft slowly rolled to the right where the damage rotor blade made contact with the

2541
02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:11.12
ground when it did the rotor blades began to disintegrate with pieces flying everywhere soldiers

2542
02:55:11.12 --> 02:55:15.52
in the back began falling out of the aircraft and they were fortunate and they were the fortunate

2543
02:55:15.52 --> 02:55:20.24
ones as the aircraft was now descending toward the ground as the right side impacted the

2544
02:55:20.24 --> 02:55:25.04
transmission was ripped from its mounts and tore through the cargo compartment as the aircraft

2545
02:55:25.04 --> 02:55:29.76
came to stop the engine was still running now whatever increasing RPM as there was no

2546
02:55:29.76 --> 02:55:36.08
rotor to turn or transmission connected fuel began to spill across the engine at this time the

2547
02:55:36.08 --> 02:55:41.04
aircraft aircraft were not equipped with self-sealing fuel cells that would prevent a major

2548
02:55:41.04 --> 02:55:46.88
fire the aircraft began to burn and burn rapidly as Bill had been waiting for chalk three and

2549
02:55:46.88 --> 02:55:51.76
forward to take off he was only he was only light on his skids when the accident happened his

2550
02:55:51.76 --> 02:55:57.28
crew chief door door gunner and captain head immediately jumped out and ran to pull people out of

2551
02:55:57.28 --> 02:56:02.32
the aircraft soldiers on the ground also moved forward to assist lightning and that was a call

2552
02:56:02.32 --> 02:56:08.16
sign of one of the guys was attempting to climb out but was days to and having difficulty moving

2553
02:56:08.16 --> 02:56:12.40
quickly to assist lightning captain head was having difficulty as well as the fire was now in the

2554
02:56:12.40 --> 02:56:17.84
cockpit and spreading rapidly the copilot was consumed in the flames as was the crew chief the

2555
02:56:17.84 --> 02:56:22.08
gunner could not be seen as he was under the aircraft having occupied the right side of the

2556
02:56:22.08 --> 02:56:28.24
aircraft that day finally lightning was extracted from the wreckage and fire yeah that's the

2557
02:56:28.24 --> 02:56:33.28
story that you told earlier yeah they are lightning that was his name is John Copenhaver

2558
02:56:33.28 --> 02:56:39.20
yeah great guy and his nickname was lightning because John just always kind of walked kind of slow

2559
02:56:40.96 --> 02:56:46.000
time to talk to a little on the slow side but we all loved him dearly and he was he was really a

2560
02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:52.40
great petoon leader as well and but yeah they hit this tree and I was always worried about John

2561
02:56:52.40 --> 02:56:57.36
and this this particular great seat pilot flying together there been an incident the month before

2562
02:56:57.36 --> 02:57:04.40
with them flying together and they lay down some stumps and there was just something about

2563
02:57:05.44 --> 02:57:12.96
this right seat pilot that the day I met him I looked at him and said this kid's not going to make it

2564
02:57:12.96 --> 02:57:17.52
there was nothing about him tell me you know he wasn't competent he was he was at halfway decent pilot

2565
02:57:18.80 --> 02:57:24.40
he was a nice guy but there was just something about it that told me he's going to make it

2566
02:57:24.40 --> 02:57:29.36
and so they had that first accident him and John and I was kind of concerned about them flying

2567
02:57:29.36 --> 02:57:33.44
together again but I didn't make flight assignments so there's nothing I could do about it and then

2568
02:57:33.44 --> 02:57:39.76
they had this happen and hit the tree and we got John out we didn't get anybody else out and

2569
02:57:39.76 --> 02:57:47.20
John spent six six weeks in a coma and but he's doing quite well today there's in there's

2570
02:57:47.20 --> 02:57:56.08
in Maryland I think it is but he's doing well so you say no one was in good spirits that evening

2571
02:57:56.08 --> 02:58:02.48
everyone in both the officers club and in listen man's club wasn't a sober mood it hurt even more

2572
02:58:02.48 --> 02:58:08.40
when we were informed that the division commanders aircraft was missing and presumed crash my good friend

2573
02:58:08.40 --> 02:58:16.88
Bill you say Michael Michael was the pilot the division commander was major general Casey a very much like

2574
02:58:16.88 --> 02:58:23.12
division commander very good guy Casey Casey was a super he had been the division assistant division commander

2575
02:58:23.68 --> 02:58:28.72
and then moved up took over as division commander had had been division commander very long

2576
02:58:28.72 --> 02:58:35.68
but he was a guy that was always out there with us you be in an LZ or you get back to a refuel point

2577
02:58:35.68 --> 02:58:40.32
and their Casey being he'd be talking to you like okay how to go you know what problems you got

2578
02:58:40.32 --> 02:58:46.08
as a aircraft running maintenance working okay he was concerned he was even as well everybody considered a

2579
02:58:46.08 --> 02:58:52.32
good leader and we were all very much down we found a they crash into a mountain top bad weather

2580
02:58:58.08 --> 02:59:01.52

2583
02:59:12.56 --> 02:59:18.80
division rear casualty assistance office you best get packing fast it suddenly dawned on me

2584
02:59:19.36 --> 02:59:23.36
Bill's parents had requested that I bring Bill's remains home

2585
02:59:24.56 --> 02:59:30.000
yeah I was close with his family I stayed there before I went to Vietnam and then when I came home

2586
02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:34.72
I'm on leave and before I went back again I stayed with this my mom and dad great great people up there

2587
02:59:34.72 --> 02:59:40.72
they lived in Monroe Washington outside of the home is she had a little brother that had just gotten

2588
02:59:40.72 --> 02:59:47.04
into the air force academy Bill was really proud of of Norm and this happened and they they

2589
02:59:47.04 --> 02:59:56.40
had me be the escort officer to bring Bill home you say arriving at the funeral home this is

2590
02:59:56.40 --> 03:00:00.96
after you get back arriving at the funeral home I made sure Bill was settled in for the night

2591
03:00:00.96 --> 03:00:05.76
and then I was taking a Bill's parents house in Monroe Washington mom and pop wanted me to stay

2592
03:00:05.76 --> 03:00:10.88
with them as they considered me family two other couples were there with mom and pop when I arrived

2593
03:00:10.88 --> 03:00:17.92
after putting my bags away in the upstairs bedroom I came into the dining room where they were all seated

2594
03:00:17.92 --> 03:00:23.04
Dan what are you drinking pop past I wasn't much of a drinker except beer but took a scotch on the rocks

2595
03:00:23.04 --> 03:00:29.84
when I sat down mom placed her hand on mine and asked what happened he was a VIP pilot she was a

2596
03:00:29.84 --> 03:00:34.24
tough woman but I could see from the puffie eyes that she had been crying I tried to explain as

2597
03:00:34.24 --> 03:00:40.88
calmly and as much detail as I could what had happened bad weather bad maps but I didn't have

2598
03:00:40.88 --> 03:00:45.52
the heart to say that the general was probably fine the aircraft generals could fly but not in

2599
03:00:45.52 --> 03:00:50.56
weather and on top of that Bill wasn't instrument rated either but could handle the aircraft

2600
03:00:50.56 --> 03:00:57.28
in weather conditions then the hard part came Bill's in the casket but I advised that it be

2601
03:00:57.28 --> 03:01:05.44
a closed casket ceremony I said before taking a sip of scotch why is that asked pop well there

2602
03:01:05.44 --> 03:01:12.64
was an explosion and fire his body is in a plastic bag under a glass case on the glass case is

2603
03:01:12.64 --> 03:01:18.64
as uniform with all his decorations the glass case is held down by 300 screws opening the lid

2604
03:01:18.64 --> 03:01:25.68
is easy but not the glass case the rest of the evening was spent telling good stories of Bill

2605
03:01:25.68 --> 03:01:32.000
from flight school and our one mission in Vietnam together between drinks and teary eyes we got

2606
03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:38.72
through the night the day of the funeral came and Bill's sister Judy arrived early with her husband

2607
03:01:38.72 --> 03:01:44.000
and children to cook breakfast the ride to church was quiet and we all sat together in the front of

2608
03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:49.68
the church it was packed as maro when row was a small town and everyone knew the Michaels

2609
03:01:50.96 --> 03:01:55.84
the preacher stood and gave the ulogy praising the work bill had done in the community and for the

2610
03:01:55.84 --> 03:02:04.40
nation he said that Bill was not afraid of death but loved life few helicopter crews in Vietnam

2611
03:02:04.40 --> 03:02:11.12
were afraid of death it was part of the job but they all loved life there were some of this

2612
03:02:11.12 --> 03:02:18.64
nation's finest when the preacher finished six army Paul Bears came forward hoisted bills casket

2613
03:02:18.64 --> 03:02:26.96
and solemnly moved outside to the hers at the grave site I lowered my salute and accepted the flag

2614
03:02:26.96 --> 03:02:33.04
from the commander of the burial detail executing a smart about face I walked over to mom thinking

2615
03:02:33.04 --> 03:02:40.56
that this was one strong woman as I saw no tears standing in front of her I knelt and said

2616
03:02:40.56 --> 03:02:47.36
on behalf of a great formation I present this flag that was what I had been instructed to say

2617
03:02:47.36 --> 03:02:54.80
but in my heart I had my doubts about this being a great formation standing slowly I came to

2618
03:02:54.80 --> 03:03:03.60
attention and again raised a slow salute in the distance the command for the firing squad could be

2619
03:03:03.60 --> 03:03:10.72
heard and three valleys of seven rounds each cause-mated jump as the 21 gun salute was fired

2620
03:03:13.52 --> 03:03:21.12
on the last volley of the three the distance sound of taps was heard no one held back tears at

2621
03:03:21.12 --> 03:03:29.76
this point I slowly lowered my salute turned and walked to the side my officials duties concluded

2622
03:03:29.76 --> 03:03:39.76
as many started to leave I came back put my arms around mom and wept just like every other human

2623
03:03:39.76 --> 03:03:51.84
there and I weep to this day yeah that was that was kind of a hard hard period for me going

2624
03:03:51.84 --> 03:03:56.72
through the funeral with them I picked Norm up at the airport from the Air Force Academy they gave

2625
03:03:56.72 --> 03:04:03.84
him leave emergency leave and he was home for that and he struggled his first year through that

2626
03:04:03.84 --> 03:04:08.72
academy because of this but he got through just fine he came to see one 41 pilot

2627
03:04:10.48 --> 03:04:15.52
and he went for the airlines and he's retired from that now so he's doing well we stay in touch

2628
03:04:15.52 --> 03:04:21.60
and mom and pop they've passed away at this point but if there was a great guy we got the chance

2629
03:04:21.60 --> 03:04:27.76
to fly together one time had a kick a kick day that day picked him up he'd never flown to combat

2630
03:04:27.76 --> 03:04:34.24
mission you know flying VIPs around that's all he ever did so I picked him up went out to a firebasing

2631
03:04:34.24 --> 03:04:38.56
they had a batag commander out there he was crazy as hell had a big red bow on the back of his

2632
03:04:38.56 --> 03:04:44.08
helmet I never asked him why that was there but he get there and he says hey yeah how do you feel

2633
03:04:44.08 --> 03:04:49.28
how do you feel about dropping bombs I said sir we're really not a quick drop bombs because

2634
03:04:49.28 --> 03:04:55.04
you're a quick drop these bombs he said how do you feel about so well yeah we'll do it so we

2635
03:04:55.04 --> 03:05:01.84
get out through the aircraft and they got this box that's on one end if it's sitting on the floor

2636
03:05:01.84 --> 03:05:08.000
and the other ends up on stands and in this box he's got about six 81 millimetre mortar rounds

2637
03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:14.16
with aerial bomb fuses in the nose and tape tied around the tails and so what we did is we flew

2638
03:05:14.16 --> 03:05:22.80
along 2000 feet and we went over these four crossing points on the river and as the crossing point

2639
03:05:22.80 --> 03:05:29.20
came up through the pedals I would say mark mark mark and they opened the door on that box

2640
03:05:29.20 --> 03:05:34.80
and these mortar rounds had fall out at 2000 feet and it was just like a bombing run and we did

2641
03:05:34.80 --> 03:05:40.08
this about four five times that day and build what guys are crazy this is great stuff and then we

2642
03:05:40.08 --> 03:05:42.96
did a log mission that he'd never done before he'd never been down in hell how I'll

2643
03:05:42.96 --> 03:05:47.84
accurate or the uh oh there was it was darn accurate it was really it was really pretty darn good accuracy

2644
03:05:48.48 --> 03:05:52.16
uh surprise 11 days but the Italian community says I don't really mortise in this range but I

2645
03:05:52.16 --> 03:05:56.96
want the NBA to think that we've got guys pretty close to them so that's the reason we were doing that

2646
03:05:57.60 --> 03:06:03.76
and we did we did one combat assault and build just he was excited when the day was over

2647
03:06:03.76 --> 03:06:09.76
flew about 10 hours a day but yeah he really enjoyed that day and it was it wasn't two months later

2648
03:06:09.76 --> 03:06:20.32
that he crashed up there so so now you're home from Vietnam and you're now going to become

2649
03:06:20.32 --> 03:06:25.84
an infantry officer you talked about your retina when did that happen that happened in 83 okay

2650
03:06:25.84 --> 03:06:30.72
so you still could fly but you still but you have to become an infantry officer is that how I want

2651
03:06:30.72 --> 03:06:34.88
yeah yeah I was an infantry officer so I went I got home and went to Fort Benning

2652
03:06:34.88 --> 03:06:39.68
attended the infantry officer basic horse went to Fort Lewis Washington to come and have a infantry

2653
03:06:39.68 --> 03:06:46.96
company up there and then uh we formed the ninth infantry division up that had been stood down

2654
03:06:46.96 --> 03:06:50.72
in Vietnam but they stood it back up I was there so I was there as the aviation officer for the

2655
03:06:50.72 --> 03:06:55.36
first brigade so I was back to flying again then it went to Fort Benning for the advanced course

2656
03:06:56.16 --> 03:07:00.48
then went to Alaska are they are they taking you with your combat experience and throwing you

2657
03:07:00.48 --> 03:07:05.52
in sort of in leadership position in these oh yeah yes company commanders I got to Alaska and they

2658
03:07:05.52 --> 03:07:10.56
made me the operations officer for the air cap squadron so I was up there for that for a year and then

2659
03:07:11.36 --> 03:07:17.20
on a Friday night I got a phone call saying you you need to report to Hank Ridge on Monday morning

2660
03:07:17.20 --> 03:07:20.24
we just relieved the company commander of the airborne company you're going to take command of the

2661
03:07:20.24 --> 03:07:24.08
airborne company why did you get relieved I didn't ask that question

2662
03:07:24.08 --> 03:07:30.16
haha she hacks that you roll in and take so it's now your company commander company commander

2663
03:07:30.16 --> 03:07:36.64
of one of the airborne companies in Alaska how do you like groundwork I loved it I love groundwork

2664
03:07:38.64 --> 03:07:42.96
I enjoyed flying but I honestly one day he was thinking when I was flying you know I'm

2665
03:07:44.32 --> 03:07:50.48
I really had glorified Greyhound bus driver and and I saw all the things that was to do in the

2666
03:07:50.48 --> 03:07:54.64
army and I I wanted to do other things besides fly that helicopter so when they said you're

2667
03:07:54.64 --> 03:07:58.40
going to be an infantry officer I had no complaints about that I love groundwork

2668
03:07:59.84 --> 03:08:05.12
commanding that airborne company in Alaska people go let's 30 below zero you're just going to jump

2669
03:08:05.12 --> 03:08:12.48
out of an airplane heck yeah let's jump so did that and then so what year is it now that was that was

2670
03:08:12.48 --> 03:08:18.24
78 I was commanding the airborne company 79 they made me the operations officer for the infantry

2671
03:08:18.24 --> 03:08:24.000
battalion how was the how was the post Vietnam years in the army terrible absolutely terrible

2672
03:08:25.84 --> 03:08:30.24
we didn't have any any ammunition to train with the fact the soldiers they would charge up a hill

2673
03:08:30.24 --> 03:08:35.44
and a training exercise and they go bang bang bang 13 cents bang bang bang 13 cents because that was

2674
03:08:35.44 --> 03:08:40.80
a cost of training rounds 13 cents around but we didn't even have training rounds it was really

2675
03:08:40.80 --> 03:08:51.20
pretty bad near me we went through a period from 70 to 75 what we were rifting captains

2676
03:08:53.20 --> 03:09:00.32
and that just killed them aral in the captains ranks uh I was in the advance course in 73

2677
03:09:00.88 --> 03:09:07.52
therefore many we had 10 200 man classrooms on one side of the building 10 200 man

2678
03:09:07.52 --> 03:09:12.88
classrooms on the other side of the building all full all of them infantry captains back

2679
03:09:12.88 --> 03:09:19.20
Vietnam and on one day they walked in and from getting a 200 man class

2680
03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:25.76
every one of those rooms went down to be in 140 man class those captains were pulled out they told

2681
03:09:25.76 --> 03:09:31.44
you have 90 days to get out where you can divert to be in a sergeant one of the other wow

2682
03:09:31.44 --> 03:09:37.28
so and they did that for four years so that really ruined the morale and the captains ranks

2683
03:09:38.08 --> 03:09:42.000
so no it wasn't not the early years after Vietnam we're not not good years in the army

2684
03:09:42.88 --> 03:09:48.000
one more question about Vietnam this is a question I bring up and you already talked about it

2685
03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:52.56
but you said most of the guys that you had most of the crew chiefs most of the most of the

2686
03:09:52.56 --> 03:09:57.84
support people that weren't flying they were people that had volunteered was it was it

2687
03:09:57.84 --> 03:10:01.52
if you're going to be a door could you be a just assigned a door gunner was there's all those people

2688
03:10:01.52 --> 03:10:07.28
volunteers uh door gunners for volunteers may they have been drafted and then they volunteered for

2689
03:10:07.28 --> 03:10:11.68
that's what a lot of them were they were drafted into the infantry they did a tour in the infantry

2690
03:10:11.68 --> 03:10:16.32
and then they volunteered to become be a door gunner got it so could you tell the difference between

2691
03:10:16.32 --> 03:10:21.44
someone that was a drafty and someone that was a life her no you really couldn't there was

2692
03:10:21.44 --> 03:10:25.84
had the guys that were drafted you know people said oh they had bad attitudes I never saw

2693
03:10:25.84 --> 03:10:31.20
but they all had a good attitude they were all in this together now what did happen

2694
03:10:32.24 --> 03:10:36.32
guys that that were drafted and they came back from nom if they still had a year left

2695
03:10:36.88 --> 03:10:40.56
they would send them to Germany and theirs were the problems were all that in Germany

2696
03:10:41.36 --> 03:10:45.20
they had a big time morale problems there what are you going to do send me back to Vietnam

2697
03:10:45.20 --> 03:10:50.000
been my dog tags it got to the point in Germany in the early 70s where the duty officers

2698
03:10:50.56 --> 03:10:55.60
were armed with 45s yeah they had one incident over there were duty officers

2699
03:10:55.60 --> 03:11:00.88
was put stuffed in a wall locker throwing out a second story window yeah the morale in Germany

2700
03:11:00.88 --> 03:11:07.28
in the early 70s was not good at all but in Vietnam they very seldom saw a problem I had one

2701
03:11:07.28 --> 03:11:13.68
problem once in the aircraft were in E6 just refused to go to the field last I saw of him the

2702
03:11:13.68 --> 03:11:20.80
MPs had him and they were driving away with him but that was it so now now we're in the 70s

2703
03:11:20.80 --> 03:11:26.16
bringing about bring us back to time and it's just morale is horrible it's tough it's tough

2704
03:11:26.16 --> 03:11:29.36
especially in the officer's court because because of all the riffs going on guide doesn't the

2705
03:11:29.36 --> 03:11:33.36
ways and have a job next month or not what are they basing it on how do you know if you're

2706
03:11:33.36 --> 03:11:39.44
going to get rifter nodded you don't it's not performance it's just numbers it's it's I would

2707
03:11:39.44 --> 03:11:44.08
like to think it was based upon your efficiency reports but we had a guy in my class had this

2708
03:11:44.08 --> 03:11:50.72
thing of service cross they rifted him what yep yeah all of us all of us said the same thing how

2709
03:11:50.72 --> 03:11:56.24
and I held it he get rifted I mean he's got the stinger service cross this is in 73 and he got rifted

2710
03:11:57.68 --> 03:12:03.68
one of the guys that that I work with in 75 Charlie had he had silver stars a couple of silver stars

2711
03:12:04.24 --> 03:12:11.04
purple heart couple of stinger flying crosses got rifted he's now he got out and he became with the

2712
03:12:11.04 --> 03:12:18.72
I think the eastern manager for Michelin tires but you didn't know if it's supposed to be best

2713
03:12:18.72 --> 03:12:22.88
on fish in your reports and I think at some point in time they just said all these guys

2714
03:12:22.88 --> 03:12:28.72
got great efficiency reports we just got to have numbers now and if you're a reserve officer

2715
03:12:29.60 --> 03:12:36.000
up till 75 you were definitely in a hunt to get rifted regular army officers didn't face that

2716
03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:44.40
the next rift 76 regular army officers were in that boat too so yeah it's just it got bad

2717
03:12:44.40 --> 03:12:49.12
so you're just keeping your fingers crossed basically yep yep I hope to God the army never

2718
03:12:49.12 --> 03:12:54.08
has to go through that again do you know do you know off the top of your head how much smaller

2719
03:12:54.08 --> 03:13:02.64
of the army got from 1970 to 1978 no I don't I don't this is a massive downsizing massive downsizing

2720
03:13:02.64 --> 03:13:08.64
I can tell you this today you could take all the 11-provel infantrymen in the army and put them in

2721
03:13:08.64 --> 03:13:16.96
RFK stadium and you still have empty seats so the army is not nearly as big as it used to be

2722
03:13:16.96 --> 03:13:22.16
not very close it's not even close that's crazy yeah today we rely a lot on the national guard

2723
03:13:22.16 --> 03:13:27.84
the army reserve and they've really stepped up they stepped up in desert storm and a lot of the

2724
03:13:27.84 --> 03:13:33.68
animosity that existed in the 70s between the active army and the army guard and the army reserves

2725
03:13:33.68 --> 03:13:38.80
a lot of that disappeared thank God during desert storm well I worked with the national guard all the

2726
03:13:38.80 --> 03:13:44.64
time in Iraq and they were freaking awesome yeah they were outstanding professionals yep they've

2727
03:13:44.64 --> 03:13:50.16
stepped up done a great job I was the aviation advisor from Maryland for two years and we had

2728
03:13:50.16 --> 03:13:55.52
an aviation maintenance company that was fantastic we took them down to brag every year for brag

2729
03:13:55.52 --> 03:14:01.20
always one these guys come down work on the aircraft form they're just really super so so this time

2730
03:14:01.20 --> 03:14:05.92
so you're continuing kind of up through the ranks you become you do your company commander tour

2731
03:14:05.92 --> 03:14:13.60
what comes after that company commander then I was an instructor at the army commander general

2732
03:14:13.60 --> 03:14:20.32
staff college I was a tactics instructor and then I got tagged kicking and screaming to go to

2733
03:14:20.32 --> 03:14:26.40
Germany as an exchange officer in the German army for two years teaching tactics and interop

2734
03:14:26.40 --> 03:14:31.76
billi issues with German forces then came back went to Fort Campbell and the fact we got a phone

2735
03:14:31.76 --> 03:14:38.40
call in the middle of the night and guy called me and he said this is the personnel officer for the

2736
03:14:38.40 --> 03:14:43.92

2737
03:14:45.04 --> 03:14:49.28

2739
03:14:52.96 --> 03:14:57.36
started to laugh at me 20 minutes later the phone rang it was my boss he says you are relief from

2740
03:14:57.36 --> 03:15:02.000
that assignment get the four camberless facets you can what was that all about uh there was something

2741
03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:07.12
coming down and they needed me to be there to be the brigade executive officer for the for the

2742
03:15:07.12 --> 03:15:11.44
second brigade did you know someone there was one of your friends or something didn't know anybody

2743
03:15:12.56 --> 03:15:17.76

2744
03:15:17.76 --> 03:15:22.64
four camber and so what was your role then obviously executive officer for the brigade

2745
03:15:22.64 --> 03:15:27.92
second brigade okay and then I was at for two years and then I went over and took command of

2746
03:15:27.92 --> 03:15:31.92
third battalion three to seventh infantry for two years and had that during desert storm

2747
03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:39.52
so tell us about desert storm it got boring tell you the truth

2748
03:15:41.52 --> 03:15:46.08
sitting out there in the desert you know we've I had the task force at West Point training the

2749
03:15:46.08 --> 03:15:52.000
cadets for the summer and my exo was sitting there he's reading the Sunday newspaper he says hey

2750
03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:56.96
you know this what takes going on with the rack and Kuwait so we read that and I said you know

2751
03:15:56.96 --> 03:16:02.08
Billy if they go into Kuwait we're gonna go to war and I think it was two weeks later it was in the

2752
03:16:02.08 --> 03:16:05.84
Wall Street jobs in the New York Times and two weeks later he got the call and I turned to Billy

2753
03:16:05.84 --> 03:16:10.96
I says let's get out of here so right away we got the West Point staff we planned out what we had

2754
03:16:10.96 --> 03:16:16.000
to get done that week and to get out of there so when we got the call on a Friday night to get out

2755
03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:21.28
of West Point we were gone the next morning and got back to Campbell had three weeks back at

2756
03:16:21.28 --> 03:16:28.16
Campbell before we'd shipped out to to Iraq or out to Saudi Arabia well if Sedan had attacked

2757
03:16:29.12 --> 03:16:35.04
we in the 80s second would have been speed bumps and thank God he didn't attack but we went up and

2758
03:16:35.04 --> 03:16:40.32
sat about 60 miles from the border and we had a defensive position set up there and that's what we

2759
03:16:40.32 --> 03:16:48.000
sat from August to February January to January oh man good times oh yes sitting out there in the

2760
03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:51.76
middle of the desert you know at least you were there in time for summer yeah yeah yeah yeah

2761
03:16:51.76 --> 03:16:56.64
yeah in August well it made us appreciate when when February January you were older when you

2762
03:16:56.64 --> 03:17:03.76
were now freezing yeah you're freezing at night so yeah we sat up there and just ran tactical exercises

2763
03:17:03.76 --> 03:17:07.76
and like we would back in the states you know it was it was it was different because we'd always

2764
03:17:07.76 --> 03:17:12.000
trained in in force and woods and stuff like that but we got up there we said all right we're in

2765
03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:16.32
new environment let's learn how to do this new environment so we spent a lot of time learning desert

2766
03:17:16.32 --> 03:17:22.56
techniques studying up on what the desert rats had done in World War II looking at some stuff that

2767
03:17:22.56 --> 03:17:27.84
we've received from SAS about desert operations and just started practicing that stuff and the kids

2768
03:17:27.84 --> 03:17:33.44
the kids did great the soldiers did fantastic and then the war kicks off and you did I get that

2769
03:17:33.44 --> 03:17:37.92
right when I opened up you there was the largest airborne assault ever it was the largest air

2770
03:17:37.92 --> 03:17:43.60
air mobile assaults yeah air assault ever and the people that don't know aerosolte is with helicopters

2771
03:17:43.60 --> 03:17:49.52
airborne is with parachutes yeah so it was the largest air so what the hell did that look like

2772
03:17:49.52 --> 03:17:56.72
oh you know I talked about in the book about we had 60s hues and you know 10 shnooks and

2773
03:17:56.72 --> 03:18:01.68
all those cobras well this made that look small because these were all black ox and

2774
03:18:01.68 --> 03:18:07.36
black ox you haven't had your home any I think oh let's see we probably had close to 80 black

2775
03:18:07.36 --> 03:18:13.92
ox and 80 black ox all taking off at the same time and we took off from several different locations

2776
03:18:14.64 --> 03:18:20.56
and then joined up in the air and and flew in for this thing and I am sure that the

2777
03:18:20.56 --> 03:18:27.12
rackies that we flew over just kind of oops oops because we got we got in there and there was

2778
03:18:27.12 --> 03:18:33.28
there are four or five positions that that were set up that that we went into right away and

2779
03:18:33.28 --> 03:18:39.52
took over and what we did is we set up a big perimeter out there so we did you you guys flew into

2780
03:18:39.52 --> 03:18:45.84
Iraq oh yeah and then you hit the ground and we're you're your mission tasking was to secure

2781
03:18:45.84 --> 03:18:51.20
some positions we're our mission tasking was to secure this big area that right away they started

2782
03:18:51.20 --> 03:18:57.04
flying in fuel blivots and we were securing for lack of a better term a giant gas station

2783
03:18:57.04 --> 03:19:02.32
for the cobras and the patchies the patches were flying out of there going after the

2784
03:19:02.32 --> 03:19:08.72
Iraqi tanks and stuff so we sat there for my bit of time sat there for two days doing that

2785
03:19:09.12 --> 03:19:13.68
and then we flew out and went with another brigade to another location and secured that

2786
03:19:13.68 --> 03:19:18.24
for the gas station I was in a state shock that we got to that second location

2787
03:19:19.44 --> 03:19:24.88
we were engaged in some Iraqis and my S3 came up and said sir, ceasefire and so what are you talking

2788
03:19:24.88 --> 03:19:29.60
about ceasefire we're in the middle of contact here, surcees fire it's word came down from Brigade

2789
03:19:29.60 --> 03:19:34.72
with the ceasefire I said you go back and had called Brigade for clarification on that I'm not

2790
03:19:34.72 --> 03:19:41.04
ceasefire and right now somebody shooting at us and he came back and he said ceasefire so we were

2791
03:19:41.04 --> 03:19:45.68
shocked after four days this thing's over and all the troops said it was a ceasefire because the

2792
03:19:45.68 --> 03:19:50.64
war was over yeah yeah and all the troops said the same thing we're gonna be back here

2793
03:19:50.64 --> 03:19:57.84
sir what what are we doing we're gonna be back here some day we can't stop now and we did

2794
03:19:59.52 --> 03:20:05.28
and it was that taking any casualties I had one soldier dislocated shoulder that was it

2795
03:20:05.28 --> 03:20:11.36
we'll take it yeah yeah in fact it was kind of kind of unique because when I when I took command of

2796
03:20:11.36 --> 03:20:17.76
the batay and my training guidance I gave it to the batay and then I said in conclusion we will go forth

2797
03:20:17.76 --> 03:20:23.92
we'll win the last battle of the next war and we'll win the entire war and we will bring everybody home

2798
03:20:24.40 --> 03:20:28.88
I didn't realize I was gonna bring everybody home alive but I was happy to do that so

2799
03:20:28.88 --> 03:20:34.32
that worked that good when you were when you were getting ready during that August to whenever the

2800
03:20:34.32 --> 03:20:41.28
invasion kicked off did you were you thinking it could be a major battle and major casualties

2801
03:20:41.28 --> 03:20:46.96
because so I came in the Navy in 1990 and I remember they were saying on the news there's going to

2802
03:20:46.96 --> 03:20:55.20
be 40,000 casualties in the first 48 hours yes in fact our operational plans my last objective was

2803
03:20:55.20 --> 03:21:01.52
the airport at Baghdad we had planted out that far as where we were gonna go and so when we got

2804
03:21:01.52 --> 03:21:07.84
the word stop after four days we're going what in the world has gone on I have heard because because

2805
03:21:07.84 --> 03:21:13.04
right now I'll put a shameless plug in I'm right in another three book series on desert storm

2806
03:21:13.04 --> 03:21:21.12
and and I have found out my research that one of the reasons that we stopped was because Turkey

2807
03:21:21.12 --> 03:21:25.76
did not want us to overthrow Saddam because Saddam they felt was the only one to keep the

2808
03:21:25.76 --> 03:21:33.20
Kurds in check and Turkey said don't go to Iraq and then Schwartzkoff's guidance was

2809
03:21:33.20 --> 03:21:38.000
kicking out of Kuwait it didn't have any guidance supposedly to go after him in Iraq so that's

2810
03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:41.28
one of the reasons we stopped but yeah we thought we were gonna go all the way to Baghdad

2811
03:21:41.28 --> 03:21:50.16
very disappointed that we did yeah well so what did you do after that was the next move the next

2812
03:21:50.16 --> 03:21:55.68
move was to an army headquarters that was the worst worth of headquarters in the army and I did

2813
03:21:55.68 --> 03:22:01.12
two years there after I got promoted and then they said sorry the next time it's the Pentagon and I said

2814
03:22:01.12 --> 03:22:09.12
I'll take the option thank you very much so I went ahead and retired 93 and now you have

2815
03:22:09.12 --> 03:22:17.28
two sons yes two sons both boys yeah they're sons they're boys they're like jay jay

2816
03:22:19.04 --> 03:22:23.84
he joined the Marine Corps reserves while I was commanded when I first got command on my batay

and found out I was retiring and said when she come to do this so I went up there and saw what it was

2850
03:25:34.32 --> 03:25:37.92
about and thought yeah I have to work for the government and it's back in the town that we want to

2851
03:25:37.92 --> 03:25:42.88
live in makes a decent wage so why not so when it back up there it's meant two years as an apprentice

2852
03:25:43.84 --> 03:25:51.36
doing that and then took my exams past those and just kept doing real estate appraising for 20 years or so

2853
03:25:51.36 --> 03:25:54.40
and then what at what point did you decide you're gonna write the books?

2854
03:25:57.84 --> 03:26:01.84
We came down here in 20 or down here we came to Florida

2855
03:26:02.32 --> 03:26:07.68
2016 that's when I finally said okay I'm fully retired sail my boat down from Tennessee

2856
03:26:08.24 --> 03:26:15.04
sailed it over and my wife had a problem come up she couldn't get on the boat anymore

2857
03:26:15.04 --> 03:26:18.56
we had a 36 foot sailboat so I thought okay I'm gonna sell the sailboat

2858
03:26:18.56 --> 03:26:24.40
she can't get on it we're not gonna can't do cruising I was doing boat deliveries from Panama and

2859
03:26:24.80 --> 03:26:30.64
Mexico but she never went on those so but anyway so suddenly I didn't have anything to do

2860
03:26:32.24 --> 03:26:42.40
and we we went down to the to the DAV because see about this this retina and we're talking to the guy

2861
03:26:42.40 --> 03:26:50.56
and he said something about Vietnam and I broke down I mean big time

2862
03:26:52.48 --> 03:26:59.12
and he said have you ever been evaluated for PTSD and I said no he's were getting you evaluated

2863
03:27:00.16 --> 03:27:05.76
and they sent me over to the VA for an evaluation I had always thought and I hate to say this

2864
03:27:05.76 --> 03:27:10.88
but I always thought PTSD was a bunch of bull I thought it was just a sham

2865
03:27:10.88 --> 03:27:18.80
and I'm sitting there with him my wife and I'm crying and they took me over there and I got

2866
03:27:18.80 --> 03:27:25.20
evaluated and they put me into 16 week programming with a psychiatrist and for about eight weeks

2867
03:27:25.92 --> 03:27:32.16
we spent one day a week me crying and working through this thing so one of the things he suggested

2868
03:27:32.16 --> 03:27:36.40
he says you know why did you write everything down that happened while you were in Vietnam

2869
03:27:36.40 --> 03:27:43.68
so I said all right so I started writing the first book and first I started writing it as an

2870
03:27:43.68 --> 03:27:49.44
autobiography and I thought well hell nobody's gonna read this so I'll make it a novel so I wrote it as a

2871
03:27:49.44 --> 03:27:57.76
novel and went to a reunion in 2019 of our our unit and it's first time I'd ever been to one

2872
03:27:57.76 --> 03:28:03.84
so I took the book with me and presented it there and the guys loved it and they said well what about

2873
03:28:03.84 --> 03:28:11.12
what about this what about this why didn't you include this so I wrote the second book and

2874
03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:17.36
did that and put that out there and it's had great reviews and then guys started calling me hey you know

2875
03:28:17.36 --> 03:28:22.32
we were in Lombson 719 the biggest battle at army aviation has ever been in why don't you

2876
03:28:22.32 --> 03:28:27.92
write a book about that so I wrote the second book or the third book and put that out and now they

2877
03:28:27.92 --> 03:28:32.000
they've come back and said well we love the third book but we want more of the wife side

2878
03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:37.20
as to what why is we're going through and this battle is going on there here and about it so right now

2879
03:28:37.20 --> 03:28:42.24
I'm drafting out a fourth book that'll that'll be coming out sometime after I get this this series

2880
03:28:42.24 --> 03:28:49.12
I'm working on now about desert storm anyone who's who kind of guided you through the writing process

2881
03:28:49.92 --> 03:28:57.60
there's a guy named James Rosen and James wrote in a couple of books a couple he's got a bunch out there

2882
03:28:57.60 --> 03:29:04.64
and he wrote one interview with a terrorist he was an interrogator and he wrote that and he wrote a

2883
03:29:04.64 --> 03:29:11.28
couple of books my mommy has PTSD my daddy has PTSD and he wrote those and I read one of his

2884
03:29:11.28 --> 03:29:16.48
boats is he's got a series called rigged and I read that and I wrote him a sentiment email saying hey

2885
03:29:16.48 --> 03:29:21.20
I really enjoyed reading your books well come to find out he lives around the corner for me and he

2886
03:29:21.20 --> 03:29:26.32
called me up he said let's go to Buffalo Wingson we went to Buffalo Wingson he had been kind of my

2887
03:29:26.32 --> 03:29:32.96
mentor guiding me through on how to write the process of how to get published and we published on Amazon

2888
03:29:33.68 --> 03:29:40.40
it fixed me up with a great editor she's really good drives I drive her crazy but so he's been kind

2889
03:29:40.40 --> 03:29:46.16
and guiding me along and then I got this while here about we need to make a movie and we're working

2890
03:29:46.16 --> 03:29:53.36
right now on that with with the two screenwriters and my producer any any idea when that's going to

2891
03:29:53.36 --> 03:29:58.56
come to fruition well we're hoping to have the screenplay done by the end of the summer and the

2892
03:29:58.56 --> 03:30:03.20
producers putting together the package that we're going to start taking to the studios I'm just hoping

2893
03:30:03.20 --> 03:30:08.000
that'll still be alive when we get it on the screen you know it takes it's about a three to four

2894
03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:16.000
year process I'm finding that to get a movie made yeah no I I think that's a minimum and it can

2895
03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:23.04
the other weird thing about movies are you can you can sell a screenplay tomorrow for a millions of

2896
03:30:23.04 --> 03:30:27.60
dollars and it can never get made yeah yeah you can just sit and someone someone buys it from

2897
03:30:28.16 --> 03:30:32.64
from you and it just sits there and that's the way it is sometimes I would rather have it made

2898
03:30:32.64 --> 03:30:37.36
than make a million dollars and I know people are going to go yeah right I think our story

2899
03:30:37.92 --> 03:30:43.52
is important enough that it needs to get out there I've already talked to a couple of organizations

2900
03:30:43.52 --> 03:30:49.68
what money we make on this a lot of it is going to get donated back to army aviation association

2901
03:30:49.68 --> 03:31:00.08
the wings of liberty museum at at four camel the American Huey Huey chapter 365 I mean these are

2902
03:31:00.08 --> 03:31:04.80
outfits that have been helped me out and stuff like that so that's our intent is to get a lot

2903
03:31:04.80 --> 03:31:11.12
of this money donated back to those that helped us well that's that's awesome look we've been going

2904
03:31:11.12 --> 03:31:18.80

2913
03:32:10.16 --> 03:32:15.44
that's one he seemed off a quiet oh and one okay what's going through is my uh okay so when you

2914
03:32:15.44 --> 03:32:21.04
started working with the uh the screen writers right and you were like hey these movies don't follow

2915
03:32:21.04 --> 03:32:27.20
this you know BS but these movies you can sort of can yeah what were the movies that you kind of

2916
03:32:27.20 --> 03:32:35.20
can like that had some integrity with their previous hacksaw ridge that's great one of the best ones

2917
03:32:35.20 --> 03:32:39.68
is hamburger hill I thought that was that was a pretty good production that they need to

2918
03:32:39.68 --> 03:32:49.04
focus on uh one of the ones I said no to was what was the Clint East one where is a marine

2919
03:32:49.84 --> 03:32:58.000
oh heartbreak heartbreak ridge now no no no no 19 17 I thought was pretty good

2920
03:32:58.88 --> 03:33:02.72
for those those are the three big ones that that I've focused these guys on looking at

2921
03:33:02.72 --> 03:33:07.60
what about saving private right oh saving private lines definitely good that's that's a great one

2922
03:33:07.60 --> 03:33:13.20
all right what about apocalypse now absolutely not what about two because we had a

2923
03:33:13.20 --> 03:33:18.40
but two is a good one okay but two is a good one never seen put you never have yeah I

2924
03:33:18.40 --> 03:33:24.16
tell you what you were recommended but you haven't seen cobra so I haven't seen cobra even of course

2925
03:33:24.16 --> 03:33:29.20
so yeah when you guys watched cobra then yeah yeah but two was one of the first good ones that

2926
03:33:29.20 --> 03:33:35.92
came out you know apocalypse now came out and yeah because I came out in 75 yeah 75 and that was such

2927
03:33:35.92 --> 03:33:40.96
I don't want to say the word on the air but absolutely not only through a poachin

2928
03:33:40.96 --> 03:33:44.88
fact I never watched the whole thing I watched bits and pieces here and there and just that

2929
03:33:44.88 --> 03:33:49.04
told me I didn't want to see this thing but Patoon came out and it was pretty darn realistic

2930
03:33:49.92 --> 03:33:55.84
I love the part where in hamburger hill where they make a brush their teeth as soon as they arrived

2931
03:33:55.84 --> 03:33:59.68
happened to us and Vietnam soon as we got off the airplane we had a brush our teeth so you know

2932
03:33:59.68 --> 03:34:04.24
stuff like that was pretty realistic to what was going on where apocalypse now was

2933
03:34:04.24 --> 03:34:13.28
blowing smoke well when the joke the joke that I forget who it was they played a joke and you said hey

2934
03:34:13.28 --> 03:34:18.56
don't salute me that was our operations officer when I got there yeah okay so that's from a scene

2935
03:34:18.56 --> 03:34:24.24
from forest gum by the way yeah yeah well it's like don't salute me yeah yeah yeah

2936
03:34:25.28 --> 03:34:30.72
except for he says it for real yes he did he's not joking okay yeah he's being serious yeah and forest

2937
03:34:30.72 --> 03:34:35.36
gum was made way after so that's interesting yeah you know I wonder if there's some sort of a

2938
03:34:35.36 --> 03:34:40.08
through two line or something well I don't know I'll call Tom Hanks up and ask him to push me

2939

Lomson 719's the best people that have read that have called me up and they said

2945
03:35:14.24 --> 03:35:19.92
I'm crying I've read this thing it's intense and and I will warn you right now if you thought the

2946
03:35:19.92 --> 03:35:24.96
combat scenes in the first one were intense that one there is just unbelievable it is absolutely

2947
03:35:24.96 --> 03:35:32.96
unbelievable what those guys went through and in flying that operation I just can't say enough about it

2948
03:35:32.96 --> 03:35:39.52
the bravery the determination the dedication the loyalty the courage you know it would be awesome

2949
03:35:39.52 --> 03:35:43.52
is if if you've gotten a friends or you know anyone that was there and they want to come on here

2950
03:35:43.52 --> 03:35:48.24

03:36:25.20 --> 03:36:32.64
and you lose in 45 days 600 aircraft 1100 crew members and you still accomplish the mission it's just

2966
03:37:22.16 --> 03:37:33.92
Colonel Matt Jackson has left the building and we are here echo Charles another guest another

2967
03:37:35.68 --> 03:37:42.40
another example of how much more we can do as human beings yeah

2968
03:37:43.36 --> 03:37:48.64
something to think something for us to think about because we should want to do more right

2969
03:37:48.64 --> 03:37:54.48
so in our lives we should want to we should want to get better and be better

2970
03:37:57.84 --> 03:38:02.64
check any suggestions on how we do that yeah planning but but the part where you know

2971
03:38:02.64 --> 03:38:07.12
when he was talking about I forget the the term when how they got a lower and they got a you know

2972
03:38:07.12 --> 03:38:13.36
when you go through the jungle with the helicopter I felt that part it was making me kind of nervous

2973
03:38:13.36 --> 03:38:19.12
like yeah imagining there's not a lot of times when I read stuff and actually I didn't read those

2974
03:38:19.12 --> 03:38:24.80
sections because it was a lot of dialogue and the dialogue would be like hold left pull left tail

2975
03:38:24.80 --> 03:38:29.76
and you know it's just like this dialogue going back and forth I don't think I could do the dialogue

2976
03:38:29.76 --> 03:38:36.56
justice yeah so I just asked him to kind of describe what it was like but yeah crazy crazy stuff

2977
03:38:36.56 --> 03:38:46.32
the whole thing just the fact that those helicopters are basically like a 1968 VW bug

2978
03:38:46.88 --> 03:38:52.56
like they got an engine they got a steering wheel you know there's not a lot of there's no computers

2979
03:38:52.56 --> 03:38:59.28
in this like yeah just completely manually maneuvered through space and he made a good point

2980
03:38:59.28 --> 03:39:02.80
through that like you kind of don't think about compared to when he compared it to airplanes

2981
03:39:02.80 --> 03:39:09.52
we're like brother helicopters all you they're playing a lot of time you can sort of let it cruise you know

2982
03:39:09.52 --> 03:39:15.60
yeah where the helicopters like man you can't wait to tell that today Burke good deal to you know

2983
03:39:15.60 --> 03:39:21.84
exactly exactly you do it all right cool yes we're all improving

2984
03:39:21.84 --> 03:39:26.56
trying to live trying the path yep I'm on the path I used to say

2985
03:39:26.56 --> 03:39:31.12
maybe what we were trying to improve is seen how quickly we could get through certain times

2986
03:39:31.12 --> 03:39:35.52
oh yeah like efficient yeah that's efficient you see getting more efficient it's opposed to rushing

2987
03:39:35.52 --> 03:39:40.32
it because we don't want to rush nothing or or do we I don't know am I wrong should I should we rush

2988
03:39:40.32 --> 03:39:48.40
it um I'm thinking we could probably move more quickly more efficient than efficiently I get it

2989
03:39:49.04 --> 03:39:54.40
I know you think that there's a bunch of people that are listening they're not they're not listening

2990
03:39:54.40 --> 03:40:02.000
they shot it off they heard Colonel Jackson left the building like oh cool let me get let me get

2991
03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:07.52
back 70 minutes of my time right now because I can just press stop on this podcast all right all right

2992
03:40:07.52 --> 03:40:12.64
okay okay I got you I got you hey look we're all in the path we may need some help

2993
03:40:12.64 --> 03:40:19.28
how about that we'll supplement ourselves with supplementation from jockel see that right there

2994
03:40:19.28 --> 03:40:25.12
that whole sentence did not need to exist it was right it exists and it has it has a massive value first

2995
03:40:25.12 --> 03:40:31.44
okay look hey look if I'm about to give you some help how should I not

2996
03:40:31.44 --> 03:40:38.64
to my when I'm should I declare that I am here to help if you need help okay or could you

2997
03:40:38.64 --> 03:40:42.56
help I'm just saying you don't you don't you don't tell us what we didn't know okay all right

2998
03:40:42.56 --> 03:40:49.04
I'm over here but you're over here you know yeah I see that's a thing I bring this on myself yes

2999
03:40:49.04 --> 03:40:53.76
you should just be totally silent yeah well okay I don't I don't know about all that okay

3000
03:40:53.76 --> 03:41:00.96
how can we help ourselves echo through supplementation jockel fuel you got problems with your

3001
03:41:00.96 --> 03:41:04.88
joints or you don't want to ever worry about your joints anymore take super cruel oil and joint

3002
03:41:04.88 --> 03:41:10.56
warfare boom you want vitamin D3 supplementation which is good for all aspects of health

3003
03:41:10.56 --> 03:41:17.84
if you care about that which we do because we're on the path boom jockel is that that as well

3004
03:41:17.84 --> 03:41:24.08
also you want some additional protein we got milk and it tastes good how about that true put a

3005
03:41:24.08 --> 03:41:30.08
banana and that's what I did something also got discipline and discipline go which are at its core

3006
03:41:30.08 --> 03:41:35.68
I like the fact that I tell you Dary and I tell you that everybody already knows all this and you

3007
03:41:35.68 --> 03:41:39.68
still tell this stuff to me like I'm hearing it for the first time well you're looking at me like

3008
03:41:39.68 --> 03:41:49.92
hearing it for the first time yeah some of us either didn't hear it or it's cool to get a reminder

3009
03:41:50.64 --> 03:41:57.20
okay you seem to say yep we're you're in my everyone's reminded good stuff yeah supplementation

3010
03:41:57.20 --> 03:42:03.52
okay get the discipline go I was I was gonna go into this earlier off air but the so if you drink

3011
03:42:03.52 --> 03:42:09.60
energy drinks yeah I don't care if you get the sugar free one but it's like at a certain

3012
03:42:09.60 --> 03:42:14.000
point usually after the first one if you taller if you're even into it after the first one you're

3013
03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:20.40
like proud and you I can't do these anymore at least for a day your body knows and they tell

3014
03:42:20.40 --> 03:42:25.44
you're mind this is not good that is the point right there yep yeah it's like your body knows

3015
03:42:25.44 --> 03:42:31.28
yep your body knows there's something wrong with this one jockel discipline go it your body

3016
03:42:31.28 --> 03:42:36.16
still knows your body knows it's good yeah your body says hey I could use a little bit more of that

3017
03:42:36.16 --> 03:42:42.48
so if you're listening to a four hour Vietnam pilot scenario brother those things just keep rolling

sure dickweed right you know that guy was about to get judo tossed right on his head so that's what I'm

3028
03:43:41.60 --> 03:43:47.12
talking about so jiu jitsu we're doing jiu jitsu sorry but yeah origin USA I'm saying if you you know

3036
03:44:24.64 --> 03:44:29.44
in there leave it to Pete Robert some function there okay Pete Robert's bleeds over in some some

3037
03:44:29.44 --> 03:44:36.32
citron scenarios put it this way he added a significant amount of aesthetic value to both by the way

3038
03:44:36.32 --> 03:44:40.96
jeans and boots I don't agree you just can't see that can't stop no it's just functional yeah yeah

3039
03:44:40.96 --> 03:44:47.28
like I said you can't really see that kind of stuff but nonetheless it is there so yes origin USA

3046
03:45:19.36 --> 03:45:26.32
of thinking of every shirt so we've expanded into a subscription scenario and this is where we can

3047
03:45:26.32 --> 03:45:33.52
experiment for lack of better term with all other ideas for shirts every idea pretty much what's this

3070
03:47:48.24 --> 03:47:53.44
okay first off the youtube channel is called jockel podcast does have echo in there at all

3071
03:47:53.44 --> 03:47:58.40
ever pretty much maybe in some of the titles yes what's the difference between a youtuber and

3072
03:47:58.40 --> 03:48:04.000
somebody that's posting youtube videos okay well I don't know I guess if you go to super youtube

3073
03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:11.12
no youtuber is that that's their primary occupation is to be on youtube but then again even that

3074
03:48:11.68 --> 03:48:16.000
yeah that that is it I think this is for as I know there's some really

3075
03:48:17.12 --> 03:48:23.84
legit youtubers out there that make freaking awesome stuff and I'm posted yeah fully there's also a lot

3076
03:48:23.84 --> 03:48:29.36
of youtubers out there it's hard to throw him in that same bucket with the awesome yeah the

3077
03:48:29.36 --> 03:48:34.96
awesomeness so I think you're more in the bucket of like you know wait all right what's the next

3078
03:48:34.96 --> 03:48:40.56
section I'm not gonna get to anyway all right cool good I mean you're a youtuber I mean to

3079
03:48:40.56 --> 03:48:44.56
bro no that's not our primary so technically we're not youtuber because we have a youtube channel

3080
03:48:44.56 --> 03:48:50.96

3081
03:48:50.96 --> 03:48:56.000
isn't album that jockel made we made of jockel telling you how to get through moments of

3082
03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:00.32
the weakness I was actually telling you yeah telling me now it's everybody not everybody that
