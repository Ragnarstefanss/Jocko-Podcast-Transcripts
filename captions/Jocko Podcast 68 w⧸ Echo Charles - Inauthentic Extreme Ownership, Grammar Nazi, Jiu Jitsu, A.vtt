00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.32
This is Jockel Podcast number 68.

2
00:00:04.32 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:09.60
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:09.60 --> 00:00:11.60
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.60 --> 00:00:18.60
So we've been doing some Facebook lives lately, Facebook Live,

6
00:00:19.24 --> 00:00:23.72
and they've been pretty cool, interacting, getting a lot of questions,

7
00:00:23.72 --> 00:00:25.08
but here's the deal.

8
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:29.000
On the Facebook Live, I think the first one I did,

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.04
I got 3,000 comments or questions in one hour,

10
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:36.60
and it's something like 40 or 50 questions a minute,

11
00:00:36.60 --> 00:00:41.12
which is one a second, which means you can't answer all of them.

12
00:00:41.12 --> 00:00:42.88
And I started looking at some of the questions,

13
00:00:42.88 --> 00:00:44.80
and there were some really good questions on there.

14
00:00:44.80 --> 00:00:47.72
And there was also a lot of common questions that pop up,

15
00:00:47.72 --> 00:00:52.32
that maybe I don't address or have an address.

16
00:00:52.32 --> 00:00:54.52
And I said, you know what, if a lot of people are asking

17
00:00:54.52 --> 00:00:57.000
the same question, there must be a need to know

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.84
or people are interested in what the answer is.

19
00:00:59.84 --> 00:01:04.60
So I kind of threw together some of those questions

20
00:01:04.60 --> 00:01:07.40
from Facebook Live, primarily,

21
00:01:07.40 --> 00:01:09.16
there's a couple other ones that I got from Twitter

22
00:01:09.16 --> 00:01:11.36
and or Facebook message.

23
00:01:11.36 --> 00:01:12.36
Is that what it's called?

24
00:01:12.36 --> 00:01:14.16
Facebook message messenger?

25
00:01:14.16 --> 00:01:16.68
Like when somebody direct messages.

26
00:01:17.80 --> 00:01:20.84
And you know, with that, if there's people

27
00:01:20.84 --> 00:01:25.84
that are sending me messages and stuff through social media,

28
00:01:25.84 --> 00:01:32.44
and even through email, I can't answer all of them right now.

29
00:01:32.44 --> 00:01:35.08
I just can't, and I apologize,

30
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:38.16
and I appreciate what you're sending me,

31
00:01:38.16 --> 00:01:39.48
but I can't always get to them all.

32
00:01:39.48 --> 00:01:40.84
There's a lot of them coming in.

33
00:01:40.84 --> 00:01:45.32
It's not, I don't have enough time to answer them all.

34
00:01:45.32 --> 00:01:48.60
I look at them and, you know,

35
00:01:48.60 --> 00:01:51.20
I'll try and throw back an answer real quick sometimes,

36
00:01:51.20 --> 00:01:55.12
but a lot of times, I just don't have time to answer them all.

37
00:01:55.12 --> 00:01:58.16
Sometimes I read them all, I do read them all,

38
00:01:58.16 --> 00:02:02.92
but you know, when I'm looking at a limited amount of time,

39
00:02:02.92 --> 00:02:07.40
and I have a ton of Facebook questions coming in,

40
00:02:08.52 --> 00:02:09.40
it can be hard.

41
00:02:09.40 --> 00:02:13.68
Hey, if you do want an answer, let me give you something

42
00:02:13.68 --> 00:02:15.76
that is helpful, if you want an answer,

43
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:20.12
ask like a really simple question, yes or no,

44
00:02:20.12 --> 00:02:23.000
or should I do this or that?

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.16
So should I go to college or join the military

46
00:02:27.16 --> 00:02:29.28
based on the situation I'm in right now,

47
00:02:29.28 --> 00:02:30.32
that I don't have any money,

48
00:02:30.32 --> 00:02:31.88
and I'd have to borrow money to go to college,

49
00:02:31.88 --> 00:02:33.44
what do you think I should do?

50
00:02:33.44 --> 00:02:35.80
There's a couple options there for me to answer.

51
00:02:35.80 --> 00:02:36.64
You know what I mean?

52
00:02:36.64 --> 00:02:38.000
It's gonna be pretty straightforward.

53
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.68
On that one, I'm gonna say, join the military.

54
00:02:40.68 --> 00:02:41.96
You want to join the military anyways?

55
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:43.60
Go get after it, boom, done.

56
00:02:43.60 --> 00:02:46.60
So, but if you give these long questions

57
00:02:46.60 --> 00:02:50.40
that then you're looking for an open-ended kind of answer,

58
00:02:50.40 --> 00:02:51.64
it's hard for me to get around to them.

59
00:02:51.64 --> 00:02:53.32
Now, those are also questions

60
00:02:53.32 --> 00:02:55.76
that I normally might pull into the podcast

61
00:02:55.76 --> 00:02:58.04
because they do require more response.

62
00:02:58.04 --> 00:03:00.36
So if that's what you're looking for,

63
00:03:00.36 --> 00:03:02.60
yes, that's a good way to send it on Facebook

64
00:03:02.60 --> 00:03:05.08
or on Twitter, if it's an open-ended answer

65
00:03:05.08 --> 00:03:06.20
that I'm gonna have to think about

66
00:03:06.20 --> 00:03:10.24
or I don't have to discuss with you, that's cool.

67
00:03:10.24 --> 00:03:13.40
But if you just need an answer about something,

68
00:03:13.40 --> 00:03:16.56
just answer, ask a direct question, I'll get around to it.

69
00:03:16.56 --> 00:03:18.04
But during the Facebook Live,

70
00:03:18.04 --> 00:03:18.88
there was a ton of questions,

71
00:03:18.88 --> 00:03:20.000
it was really cool.

72
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.40
I had never done Facebook Live before

73
00:03:22.40 --> 00:03:25.16
and got a lot of good questions.

74
00:03:25.16 --> 00:03:30.16
So, with that, let's go to this subject today

75
00:03:30.80 --> 00:03:32.88
from the Facebook people.

76
00:03:35.16 --> 00:03:36.08
And Twitter, I'm a man.

77
00:03:36.08 --> 00:03:36.92
And Twitter.

78
00:03:36.92 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah.

79
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.88
These primarily came from Facebook Live.

80
00:03:40.88 --> 00:03:41.72
Oh, dang much.

81
00:03:41.72 --> 00:03:45.24
I went through every comment.

82
00:03:45.24 --> 00:03:46.08
Yeah.

83
00:03:46.08 --> 00:03:47.32
So it took some time.

84
00:03:47.32 --> 00:03:48.16
Yeah.

85
00:03:48.16 --> 00:03:50.68
I seriously, my computer started lagging.

86
00:03:50.68 --> 00:03:51.68
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:51.68 --> 00:03:53.96
Which, and I know I talk about being mad at computers

88
00:03:53.96 --> 00:03:55.72
or at printers and copy machines,

89
00:03:55.72 --> 00:03:59.16
but when my computer's lagging, that also can get me angry.

90
00:03:59.16 --> 00:04:00.60
Yeah, the computer's pushing it up.

91
00:04:00.60 --> 00:04:02.000
Pushing it's luck.

92
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.60
I just want the thing to work quickly.

93
00:04:04.60 --> 00:04:06.08
Yeah, that's the whole thing though.

94
00:04:06.08 --> 00:04:08.88
That's the whole thing with computers.

95
00:04:08.88 --> 00:04:11.60
It's like, of course you want to work more quickly.

96
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:13.48
But like, if you get a cheap computer,

97
00:04:13.48 --> 00:04:15.80
I don't have a cheap main thing.

98
00:04:15.80 --> 00:04:18.12
Oh, yeah, so you have expectations.

99
00:04:18.12 --> 00:04:19.48
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:19.48 --> 00:04:20.000
Makes sense.

101
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.56
I want the thing to work quickly.

102
00:04:21.56 --> 00:04:22.56
Yeah.

103
00:04:22.56 --> 00:04:25.16
I almost got a T1 line.

104
00:04:25.16 --> 00:04:26.96
You know, that is Internet-wise.

105
00:04:26.96 --> 00:04:28.80
I thought that that was like old school.

106
00:04:28.80 --> 00:04:34.24
No, it's the T1 line is when you're getting it.

107
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:40.60
And they guarantee 99.9% up and going and never break.

108
00:04:40.60 --> 00:04:42.20
Never have any issues.

109
00:04:42.20 --> 00:04:45.04
I almost got a T1 line for a Tesla.

110
00:04:45.04 --> 00:04:46.04
For a Tesla.

111
00:04:46.04 --> 00:04:47.68
I think I didn't do it.

112
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:50.16
Yeah, hey, that's up to you, obviously.

113
00:04:50.16 --> 00:04:54.92
And with that, I think let's go to the question.

114
00:04:54.92 --> 00:04:56.12
First question questions.

115
00:04:56.12 --> 00:04:58.76
Okay, Jockel first question.

116
00:04:58.76 --> 00:05:00.12
Do you work out every day?

117
00:05:00.12 --> 00:05:03.92
Okay, yeah, this is a question that a bunch of people were asking me.

118
00:05:03.92 --> 00:05:08.12
And I thought it was pretty evident that I do work out every day, which I do.

119
00:05:08.12 --> 00:05:15.84
And then I also thought that there was a little misleading statement in the success magazine

120
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:16.84
article.

121
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:22.04
Again, I don't know what I said on some of these questions or how I answered it at the

122
00:05:22.04 --> 00:05:24.84
time or what I explained or how I explained it.

123
00:05:24.84 --> 00:05:30.12
But there was a misleading statement that on this particular day, I had already lifted in

124
00:05:30.12 --> 00:05:32.44
the morning at 0, 430.

125
00:05:32.44 --> 00:05:37.08
And now I was lifting again at 9 or whatever time it was.

126
00:05:37.08 --> 00:05:38.08
And then I was going to lift it.

127
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:41.56
It was like made it seem like I was lifting just over and over again throughout the

128
00:05:41.56 --> 00:05:44.76
day, which generally I don't do.

129
00:05:44.76 --> 00:05:48.28
Generally, when I wake up in the morning, I lift.

130
00:05:48.28 --> 00:05:51.12
And by lift, I mean, work out.

131
00:05:51.12 --> 00:05:52.84
By work out, that might mean lift.

132
00:05:52.84 --> 00:05:54.80
It might mean do galestinics.

133
00:05:54.80 --> 00:05:59.28
It might mean sometimes it just means stretching, right?

134
00:05:59.28 --> 00:06:00.44
But rarely do I do.

135
00:06:00.44 --> 00:06:01.44
I stretch.

136
00:06:01.44 --> 00:06:06.000
But like yesterday, I was feeling a little under the weather for two days.

137
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.08
Wasn't full on sick.

138
00:06:07.08 --> 00:06:09.32
My, some of my family members got sick.

139
00:06:09.32 --> 00:06:10.68
They were really sick.

140
00:06:10.68 --> 00:06:13.88
And when it hit me, it didn't hit me as hard.

141
00:06:13.88 --> 00:06:18.64
Because I, you know, fought against against the illness.

142
00:06:18.64 --> 00:06:19.64
So I was a little bit sick.

143
00:06:19.64 --> 00:06:21.60
But one day, as someone was like, okay, I'm just going to go and stretch.

144
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:26.20
The next day, I was like, leg day, you know, I was going to go do squats.

145
00:06:26.20 --> 00:06:27.04
And I did squats.

146
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:32.28
But if anybody was to come and witness that workout, I would have to be ashamed of myself.

147
00:06:32.28 --> 00:06:35.08
Because all I did was basically go in there, go through the motion, put a little weight on

148
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:36.08
the bar move.

149
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:38.36
But yes, I do.

150
00:06:38.36 --> 00:06:39.36
I work out.

151
00:06:39.36 --> 00:06:42.20
So even when I'm sick, I'm going to work out.

152
00:06:42.20 --> 00:06:43.20
Right.

153
00:06:43.20 --> 00:06:44.20
I'm going to work out.

154
00:06:44.20 --> 00:06:47.04
And when to do something, because I think it's healthy to do something.

155
00:06:47.04 --> 00:06:52.20
Now another question that people say is like, do you lift and do you just win the same

156
00:06:52.20 --> 00:06:53.20
day?

157
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:55.76
Yes, absolutely.

158
00:06:55.76 --> 00:06:57.96
All the time, almost daily.

159
00:06:57.96 --> 00:07:03.40
Another branch question of that one is, do you lift before you get to or after

160
00:07:03.40 --> 00:07:04.40
you did to?

161
00:07:04.40 --> 00:07:07.24
I like to lift before you did to.

162
00:07:07.24 --> 00:07:09.52
I want to go into you to a little bit tired.

163
00:07:09.52 --> 00:07:14.08
Does it matter if I have some of the young guns at the gym?

164
00:07:14.08 --> 00:07:19.20
They'll say, oh, you know, I'll go into roll with them at night and the young guns will

165
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:20.84
say, oh, I already worked out.

166
00:07:20.84 --> 00:07:22.40
We worked hard to work out today.

167
00:07:22.40 --> 00:07:23.68
I'm not all fresh.

168
00:07:23.68 --> 00:07:25.04
You know what I was saying?

169
00:07:25.04 --> 00:07:26.04
We think I'm fresh.

170
00:07:26.04 --> 00:07:27.40
We think I've been doing all day.

171
00:07:27.40 --> 00:07:39.28
So yeah, I like to work out before I do Gigi Gigi and I like to surf.

172
00:07:39.28 --> 00:07:44.72
If there's good waves or even marginal waves, get a little surf session in and if I can

173
00:07:44.72 --> 00:07:48.96
get, I don't like to use the word cardio, but I'll use it.

174
00:07:48.96 --> 00:07:51.44
It's nice to go for a little run, little jog.

175
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:54.08
So that's sort of like my grand slam of a day.

176
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:55.08
Oh, the three.

177
00:07:55.08 --> 00:07:56.08
No four.

178
00:07:56.08 --> 00:07:57.08
Four, four.

179
00:07:57.08 --> 00:08:05.56
If I work out, you know, lift, calisthenics or whatever, then do some kind of a, again, I'll

180
00:08:05.56 --> 00:08:11.56
use the word cardio, go for a run, go for a jog, go for a swim, surf.

181
00:08:11.56 --> 00:08:12.56
That's awesome.

182
00:08:12.56 --> 00:08:14.12
Then you throw the Gigi to one on top of it.

183
00:08:14.12 --> 00:08:15.36
That's a grand slam for me.

184
00:08:15.36 --> 00:08:16.76
I love those days.

185
00:08:16.76 --> 00:08:21.40
And those of days you go to sleep at night, you know, those of the days, you go to bed

186
00:08:21.40 --> 00:08:22.56
and you feel tired.

187
00:08:22.56 --> 00:08:23.56
Yeah.

188
00:08:23.56 --> 00:08:29.72
You know, that's one of the things in the book that's coming out, the field manual, discipline

189
00:08:29.72 --> 00:08:31.20
equals freedom, field manual.

190
00:08:31.20 --> 00:08:32.20
I talk about sleep.

191
00:08:32.20 --> 00:08:37.16
And one of the things I talk about is, you know, people are saying, how, how do you

192
00:08:37.16 --> 00:08:38.16
fall asleep at night?

193
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:41.88
Because a lot of people, you know, we all, everyone has trouble getting up in the morning,

194
00:08:41.88 --> 00:08:44.08
but then when you start saying, okay, well, I'm going to go to bed earlier.

195
00:08:44.08 --> 00:08:45.52
People have trouble falling asleep.

196
00:08:45.52 --> 00:08:46.52
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:46.52 --> 00:08:48.84
There's a lot of people, even me.

198
00:08:48.84 --> 00:08:50.32
So what do you do to fall asleep earlier?

199
00:08:50.32 --> 00:08:52.28
I got a couple steps in the field manual.

200
00:08:52.28 --> 00:08:54.96
One of the steps in the field manual is be more tired.

201
00:08:54.96 --> 00:08:55.96
Yeah.

202
00:08:55.96 --> 00:08:56.96
How do you be more tired?

203
00:08:56.96 --> 00:08:58.40
You work out harder during the day.

204
00:08:58.40 --> 00:09:00.24
You drain yourself physically and mentally during the day.

205
00:09:00.24 --> 00:09:02.12
That way when you go, go to bed at night.

206
00:09:02.12 --> 00:09:03.12
You will fall asleep.

207
00:09:03.12 --> 00:09:04.12
Yeah.

208
00:09:04.12 --> 00:09:07.96
And I got the whole thing laid out there, but that's one of them.

209
00:09:07.96 --> 00:09:08.96
One other note.

210
00:09:08.96 --> 00:09:09.96
So that's it.

211
00:09:09.96 --> 00:09:11.60
You know, do I work out every day?

212
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:12.96
Yes, do something every day.

213
00:09:12.96 --> 00:09:13.96
Do something.

214
00:09:13.96 --> 00:09:14.96
Do something.

215
00:09:14.96 --> 00:09:20.48
Even if you, even if all you have this 10 minutes, 200 burpees, you know, just 200

216
00:09:20.48 --> 00:09:24.000
burpees, just at a minimum, make that happen.

217
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.24
But also sick.

218
00:09:27.24 --> 00:09:29.32
If you're sick, do what you can, get a little sweat going.

219
00:09:29.32 --> 00:09:34.28
If you're injured, do what you can, if you're sick, caveat, that doesn't mean go train

220
00:09:34.28 --> 00:09:35.28
you, get to.

221
00:09:35.28 --> 00:09:37.04
Because if you're sick, you make everybody else sick.

222
00:09:37.04 --> 00:09:38.04
Yeah, add you, get to.

223
00:09:38.04 --> 00:09:40.04
And that's not cool.

224
00:09:40.04 --> 00:09:43.64
So if you're that kind of sick, don't do it.

225
00:09:43.64 --> 00:09:47.000
But other than that, yes, I work out every day.

226
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.04
I try and train every day.

227
00:09:49.04 --> 00:09:51.04
I stay active.

228
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:52.04
Yeah, bottom line.

229
00:09:52.04 --> 00:09:57.16
It's going to be hard to try to mask your routine onto someone else.

230
00:09:57.16 --> 00:10:02.12
You know, like you, you can't just go into, let's say I'm a guy I work out.

231
00:10:02.12 --> 00:10:03.48
Wanted once a day.

232
00:10:03.48 --> 00:10:07.56
And it's like just, let's say it's a stringuous workout.

233
00:10:07.56 --> 00:10:08.56
That's super stringuous.

234
00:10:08.56 --> 00:10:10.20
Not like hard.

235
00:10:10.20 --> 00:10:13.68
I can't just be like, hey, Jockel works out four times a day on his good dance.

236
00:10:13.68 --> 00:10:15.16
Let me start doing that.

237
00:10:15.16 --> 00:10:19.16
Like you can not only get hurt, but it won't work.

238
00:10:19.16 --> 00:10:20.16
Yeah.

239
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:26.84
And that's another misconception is that every single day that I go, that I work out,

240
00:10:26.84 --> 00:10:31.56
I'm going level 29, dis-self destruction.

241
00:10:31.56 --> 00:10:32.84
You can't do that.

242
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:33.84
You can't do that.

243
00:10:33.84 --> 00:10:35.44
It doesn't eat.

244
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:36.44
You can't do it.

245
00:10:36.44 --> 00:10:37.44
You just can't do it.

246
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:39.24
It's not like you can't do it because it'll hurt you.

247
00:10:39.24 --> 00:10:40.84
You just can't do it.

248
00:10:40.84 --> 00:10:46.60
You do squats, heavy one day, or you go through three or four days of going really hard.

249
00:10:46.60 --> 00:10:50.48
The fifth, six day, one of those days, you're going to be like, okay, I need to back

250
00:10:50.48 --> 00:10:51.48
off today.

251
00:10:51.48 --> 00:10:53.32
Whatever the day it is.

252
00:10:53.32 --> 00:10:55.72
So I'll, you do some kind of workout.

253
00:10:55.72 --> 00:11:02.48
I'll still go, I'll still get it on, but I'm not going to go level 29, you know, self destruction.

254
00:11:02.48 --> 00:11:09.08
When I was going to boot camp, there was, they would say there was a room attached to the

255
00:11:09.08 --> 00:11:13.24
main hall, the main barracks where everyone was, this open bay barracks.

256
00:11:13.24 --> 00:11:18.000
And if you got in trouble for something, they'd send you to this side room and they'd say,

257
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.64
go in there and self-destruct.

258
00:11:20.64 --> 00:11:21.64
Which meant you did.

259
00:11:21.64 --> 00:11:27.32
And they had a list of exercises and it was jumping jacks, pushups, you know, sit up,

260
00:11:27.32 --> 00:11:30.40
just a bunch of random calisthenics.

261
00:11:30.40 --> 00:11:35.56
When they'd send you and they'd see that, it was posted.

262
00:11:35.56 --> 00:11:39.56
And then you went in there and you did one of every exercise, then two of every exercise

263
00:11:39.56 --> 00:11:45.24
is then three and then four and then five and then six and one of my buddies who ended up

264
00:11:45.24 --> 00:11:48.20
being a seal who's a great dude, who I went to boot camp with.

265
00:11:48.20 --> 00:11:52.52
He said he is the only guy I went to navy boot camp with and we both ended up in the

266
00:11:52.52 --> 00:11:53.84
seal teams.

267
00:11:53.84 --> 00:12:01.60
But the chief that was running is like, you know, whatever is seeming a bonus, he was

268
00:12:01.60 --> 00:12:03.64
kid in there and self-destruct.

269
00:12:03.64 --> 00:12:08.60
And this guy was a wrestler, a college wrestler, legit college wrestler, a great dude.

270
00:12:08.60 --> 00:12:13.32
And he went in there and, you know, normally people are done by whatever, you know, five

271
00:12:13.32 --> 00:12:16.36
or six repetitions or maybe eight repetitions.

272
00:12:16.36 --> 00:12:18.92
He was in there for like an hour.

273
00:12:18.92 --> 00:12:21.80
He came out just dripping with sweat.

274
00:12:21.80 --> 00:12:25.32
It was, I knew he was in there getting out.

275
00:12:25.32 --> 00:12:26.32
For sure.

276
00:12:26.32 --> 00:12:27.32
Yeah.

277
00:12:27.32 --> 00:12:29.60
The wrestler version of the rest of the room.

278
00:12:29.60 --> 00:12:35.000
It's different than some guy from wherever that's, you know, a non wrestler.

279
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
A non wrestler.

280
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yes.

281
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So, put quite simply.

282
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yes.

283
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Thanks.

284
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And they just kind of leave it to you.

285
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yeah.

286
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Did self-destruct.

287
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Yeah.

288
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That's what it was.

289
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.24
He was the master at arms in my boot camp, which I don't even remember.

290
00:12:49.24 --> 00:12:50.24
Who the wrestler guy?

291
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:51.24
The wrestler guy.

292
00:12:51.24 --> 00:12:52.24
He was the master at arms.

293
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:54.80
We were both from New England too.

294
00:12:54.80 --> 00:13:00.52
And so we had driven the, the, the flown down there, the forward on the same plane.

295
00:13:00.52 --> 00:13:04.76
And of course, we were both kind of, you know, what do you go in the Navy for?

296
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:05.76
I want to be a seal.

297
00:13:05.76 --> 00:13:06.76
What are you going for?

298
00:13:06.76 --> 00:13:07.76
I want to be a seal, too.

299
00:13:07.76 --> 00:13:12.04
So we kind of had a little bit of, okay, well, at least this guy is kind of getting

300
00:13:12.04 --> 00:13:14.000
after it in some way.

301
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And honestly, he was called a wrestler.

302
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.44
I was probably like a little punk team because he's thinking, what is this?

303
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:18.72
I was just a high school kid.

304
00:13:18.72 --> 00:13:19.72
No, I'm wrestling.

305
00:13:19.72 --> 00:13:20.72
I'm wrestling.

306
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:23.16
I want to be a Navy seal.

307
00:13:23.16 --> 00:13:24.16
Yeah.

308
00:13:24.16 --> 00:13:25.16
And yeah.

309
00:13:25.16 --> 00:13:27.36
So anyways, he was the master at arms.

310
00:13:27.36 --> 00:13:28.36
That's what he was like.

311
00:13:28.36 --> 00:13:30.92
Mastered arms, getting that room itself, destruct.

312
00:13:30.92 --> 00:13:32.72
So, that was a good time.

313
00:13:32.72 --> 00:13:36.36
So no, I do not self-destruct on a daily basis.

314
00:13:36.36 --> 00:13:38.52
But I do get it on every day.

315
00:13:38.52 --> 00:13:43.40
And definitely push myself on a regular basis.

316
00:13:43.40 --> 00:13:44.40
Yeah.

317
00:13:44.40 --> 00:13:49.64
And that's obviously going to depend on what you like, what is the results?

318
00:13:49.64 --> 00:13:54.28
Because you're not at a point where you're like, hey, I need to really get in shape.

319
00:13:54.28 --> 00:13:55.88
I need to lose 25 pounds.

320
00:13:55.88 --> 00:13:57.88
No, I'm not saying that.

321
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:04.72
You know what is interesting though is the days where I'm getting the grand slam going

322
00:14:04.72 --> 00:14:07.20
when I get to Gitu, I feel good.

323
00:14:07.20 --> 00:14:08.20
Yeah.

324
00:14:08.20 --> 00:14:12.08
I train way better when I'm in the zone when I've been working now, when I've had a good

325
00:14:12.08 --> 00:14:13.48
work out, I've served.

326
00:14:13.48 --> 00:14:15.20
I show up to Gitu, I feel great.

327
00:14:15.20 --> 00:14:17.60
I don't feel off-field tired, but I feel better.

328
00:14:17.60 --> 00:14:18.60
Right.

329
00:14:18.60 --> 00:14:21.28
Yeah, it's kind of like your second round of rolling.

330
00:14:21.28 --> 00:14:26.16
If for whatever reason, I don't get a workout in the morning or I only get a really

331
00:14:26.16 --> 00:14:27.16
short workout in the morning.

332
00:14:27.16 --> 00:14:28.44
And then I go to change Gitu.

333
00:14:28.44 --> 00:14:31.60
I never feel optimal.

334
00:14:31.60 --> 00:14:36.16
And as a matter of fact, I have a personal superstition slash curse in my own head that

335
00:14:36.16 --> 00:14:41.20
if I don't work out in the morning, I am going to get injured.

336
00:14:41.20 --> 00:14:44.56
So that forces me to work out even when I don't want to.

337
00:14:44.56 --> 00:14:46.04
So I say, well, I'm going to train tonight.

338
00:14:46.04 --> 00:14:50.24
I don't want to get injured because there's been, I think, two injuries that I've gotten

339
00:14:50.24 --> 00:14:51.72
from Gitu.

340
00:14:51.72 --> 00:14:54.64
Both of them happened when I didn't work out in the morning.

341
00:14:54.64 --> 00:14:55.64
I'm not getting it.

342
00:14:55.64 --> 00:14:56.64
One of them.

343
00:14:56.64 --> 00:15:00.96
Yeah, I didn't work out in the morning and I showed up and went to train and one of

344
00:15:00.96 --> 00:15:04.92
them hurt my ankle really bad like a high ankle sprain.

345
00:15:04.92 --> 00:15:07.28
And that was bad, but I didn't work out in the morning.

346
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:08.28
That must have been it.

347
00:15:08.28 --> 00:15:09.28
And I think the, yeah.

348
00:15:09.28 --> 00:15:10.28
Well, personally.

349
00:15:10.28 --> 00:15:15.56
I had to, I think the other one was, I think the other one was a knee injury.

350
00:15:15.56 --> 00:15:17.28
No, what's in the knee injury?

351
00:15:17.28 --> 00:15:19.28
I think it was a shoulder injury.

352
00:15:19.28 --> 00:15:22.92
Anyways, whatever it was, it's also that day didn't work out in the morning.

353
00:15:22.92 --> 00:15:26.60
For some pathetic reason, you know, didn't work out.

354
00:15:26.60 --> 00:15:30.36
So for me, work out, it's mental prep.

355
00:15:30.36 --> 00:15:31.36
It's physical prep.

356
00:15:31.36 --> 00:15:32.80
Get you ready for the evening.

357
00:15:32.80 --> 00:15:33.80
The jujits.

358
00:15:33.80 --> 00:15:38.88
I think that's, I think that's called availability bias.

359
00:15:38.88 --> 00:15:43.12
And you kind of draw that conclusion, you know, in your specific cases.

360
00:15:43.12 --> 00:15:45.68
Oh, it stands out in your mind on this emotional level.

361
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:48.12
So it's like, you know, you actually didn't really happen though.

362
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:49.12
So never mind.

363
00:15:49.12 --> 00:15:50.12
No, but cognitive bias.

364
00:15:50.12 --> 00:15:51.12
I'm telling you what happened.

365
00:15:51.12 --> 00:15:52.12
I understand.

366
00:15:52.12 --> 00:15:53.12
I would have.

367
00:15:53.12 --> 00:15:57.20
But you have to consider all the times in your whole jujits of career that you didn't

368
00:15:57.20 --> 00:15:58.20
work out.

369
00:15:58.20 --> 00:15:59.20
That's what I'm saying.

370
00:15:59.20 --> 00:16:02.40
That was the only, it's, it's a such a small number.

371
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:03.76
It's such a small number.

372
00:16:03.76 --> 00:16:06.08
I bet you it is.

373
00:16:06.08 --> 00:16:13.60
I bet you there's 10 times in the past 10 years that I didn't work out in the morning.

374
00:16:13.60 --> 00:16:15.56
And I, and I trained jujitsu that night.

375
00:16:15.56 --> 00:16:16.56
Yeah, 200, 10.

376
00:16:16.56 --> 00:16:17.56
That's bad, huh?

377
00:16:17.56 --> 00:16:18.56
Yeah.

378
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:19.76
You can't consider, you can't include that.

379
00:16:19.76 --> 00:16:21.88
And that's probably pretty generous.

380
00:16:21.88 --> 00:16:25.60
It might be like five because sometimes I'm on the road.

381
00:16:25.60 --> 00:16:27.72
And then I didn't work out, but I didn't train jujitsu.

382
00:16:27.72 --> 00:16:35.60
But for me to be here in my hometown with access to my garage gym and the jujitsu, for

383
00:16:35.60 --> 00:16:38.20
me to just say, oh, I'm just not going to work out today.

384
00:16:38.20 --> 00:16:39.84
I don't say that, right?

385
00:16:39.84 --> 00:16:41.48
It's not very common.

386
00:16:41.48 --> 00:16:42.48
No.

387
00:16:42.48 --> 00:16:43.48
Yeah.

388
00:16:43.48 --> 00:16:50.08
I would say if it was a muscle strain or tear or something like this, I would say

389
00:16:50.08 --> 00:16:54.36
that I would maybe make it a little different because you're stiffer, you know?

390
00:16:54.36 --> 00:16:55.52
But then again, ankle too.

391
00:16:55.52 --> 00:16:59.72
If you're super like warm, you can stretch your ankles and shoulders a lot.

392
00:16:59.72 --> 00:17:00.72
So I don't know.

393
00:17:00.72 --> 00:17:01.72
Maybe you might be right.

394
00:17:01.72 --> 00:17:03.08
I could be to have it completely.

395
00:17:03.08 --> 00:17:04.56
Certainly sounds like I'm right.

396
00:17:04.56 --> 00:17:08.44
But statistically, I think I win statistically.

397
00:17:08.44 --> 00:17:12.72
No, statistically, let's say it's inconclusive.

398
00:17:12.72 --> 00:17:13.72
Okay.

399
00:17:13.72 --> 00:17:16.48
So 20% is not conclusive to you.

400
00:17:16.48 --> 00:17:17.48
Okay.

401
00:17:17.48 --> 00:17:18.48
No.

402
00:17:18.48 --> 00:17:19.48
You know what I'll do?

403
00:17:19.48 --> 00:17:20.48
I'll keep working out.

404
00:17:20.48 --> 00:17:21.48
Give it a quantity.

405
00:17:21.48 --> 00:17:22.48
Like you'd have to do it over time.

406
00:17:22.48 --> 00:17:26.84
And then if there's like a discernible 20%, then you could start to conclude.

407
00:17:26.84 --> 00:17:27.84
Okay.

408
00:17:27.84 --> 00:17:28.84
I'm 20%.

409
00:17:28.84 --> 00:17:29.84
You're so excited about that.

410
00:17:29.84 --> 00:17:30.84
That's what we're talking about.

411
00:17:30.84 --> 00:17:31.84
That's what we're talking about.

412
00:17:31.84 --> 00:17:32.84
That's what we're talking about.

413
00:17:32.84 --> 00:17:33.84
That's what we're talking about.

414
00:17:33.84 --> 00:17:38.72
Well, as a right now, statistically, 20% were like, we get hurt if you don't, which is pretty

415
00:17:38.72 --> 00:17:39.72
big.

416
00:17:39.72 --> 00:17:40.72
Work out.

417
00:17:40.72 --> 00:17:41.72
Yes.

418
00:17:41.72 --> 00:17:42.72
Yeah.

419
00:17:42.72 --> 00:17:43.72
Those aren't good odds at all.

420
00:17:43.72 --> 00:17:44.72
I know.

421
00:17:44.72 --> 00:17:45.72
I'm working out every day now.

422
00:17:45.72 --> 00:17:46.72
That's what I'm talking about.

423
00:17:46.72 --> 00:17:47.72
Yeah.

424
00:17:47.72 --> 00:17:48.72
I used to do that.

425
00:17:48.72 --> 00:17:49.84
But I would go hard workout, think of you too.

426
00:17:49.84 --> 00:17:50.84
But same thing though.

427
00:17:50.84 --> 00:17:51.84
I think it's mental.

428
00:17:51.84 --> 00:17:55.28
Unless you're doing it like seven days a week for, you know, a few weeks then you

429
00:17:55.28 --> 00:18:00.08
can start to feel like, hey, or your nutrition is bad or I don't know something.

430
00:18:00.08 --> 00:18:01.08
It's to go.

431
00:18:01.08 --> 00:18:02.60
Are you feeling better?

432
00:18:02.60 --> 00:18:03.60
You feel better.

433
00:18:03.60 --> 00:18:04.60
Sometimes, not all the time though.

434
00:18:04.60 --> 00:18:07.40
No, sometimes I'll feel better if I don't work out.

435
00:18:07.40 --> 00:18:11.92
But so I wouldn't say that necessarily in my case, but I think it is more mental.

436
00:18:11.92 --> 00:18:17.48
In Gigi, too, like, I think it's natural to put pressure in yourself to perform in Gigi's

437
00:18:17.48 --> 00:18:18.48
training.

438
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:20.20
You know, because I think it's part of it.

439
00:18:20.20 --> 00:18:21.68
Like, when I go in, I'm going to roll against you.

440
00:18:21.68 --> 00:18:23.68
I'm going to try to do good against you.

441
00:18:23.68 --> 00:18:28.96
I'm not going to every single time I'm not going to go in and be like, let's just see what

442
00:18:28.96 --> 00:18:29.96
I learned today.

443
00:18:29.96 --> 00:18:33.20
Let me work on my weaknesses and try to learn and try to try to win.

444
00:18:33.20 --> 00:18:37.64
And there's that element I think most of the time for most people.

445
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:43.52
So mentally will play these games or will kind of psych herself out like, I'm not at my

446
00:18:43.52 --> 00:18:46.36
best because I'm kind of tired from working out.

447
00:18:46.36 --> 00:18:47.80
So I won't be able to perform.

448
00:18:47.80 --> 00:18:49.04
Now the pressure is on.

449
00:18:49.04 --> 00:18:51.04
Maybe I'm going to roll with the guy who's my level.

450
00:18:51.04 --> 00:18:53.04
Maybe my instructor is going to see me roll with him.

451
00:18:53.04 --> 00:18:54.76
I'm not going to do as good as I normally do.

452
00:18:54.76 --> 00:18:57.24
He won't all think I'm not as good as I really am.

453
00:18:57.24 --> 00:18:59.84
You know, it's like, you're saying there's mental pressure when you're at the Gigi.

454
00:18:59.84 --> 00:19:03.16
That's why I think that's why people will say, oh, I work.

455
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:04.16
Out today.

456
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:06.36
I don't want you to judge my performance.

457
00:19:06.36 --> 00:19:08.36
It's a pretty role excuse.

458
00:19:08.36 --> 00:19:09.36
In a way.

459
00:19:09.36 --> 00:19:10.36
Yeah, I do.

460
00:19:10.36 --> 00:19:11.36
I do.

461
00:19:11.36 --> 00:19:12.36
Because it would be a lie too.

462
00:19:12.36 --> 00:19:13.36
Yeah.

463
00:19:13.36 --> 00:19:15.28
Because I would actually go and say, hey, I didn't work out today.

464
00:19:15.28 --> 00:19:17.32
Therefore, my game is going to be weak.

465
00:19:17.32 --> 00:19:18.32
That's what I would have to say.

466
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:20.08
But I would say that's not the case for you.

467
00:19:20.08 --> 00:19:21.08
What's it that?

468
00:19:21.08 --> 00:19:22.08
Yeah.

469
00:19:22.08 --> 00:19:23.08
And it's pretty rare.

470
00:19:23.08 --> 00:19:25.24
I think, I mean, it might experience.

471
00:19:25.24 --> 00:19:30.36
It's pretty rare that, oh, work out, even a hard workout in the morning and then go

472
00:19:30.36 --> 00:19:32.28
roll at night and then it affects me.

473
00:19:32.28 --> 00:19:34.88
Like, yeah, I feel it's pretty rare now.

474
00:19:34.88 --> 00:19:38.84
Now I will get so sore sometimes.

475
00:19:38.84 --> 00:19:44.80
You know, if you do squats or you a hardcore, like a hardcore kettlebell workout, I'll

476
00:19:44.80 --> 00:19:46.000
be sore.

477
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.24
And it takes a few minutes to get that soreness out of the body once you're on the

478
00:19:49.24 --> 00:19:50.24
mats.

479
00:19:50.24 --> 00:19:54.84
And sometimes somebody will be doing some movement that's grinding on the quads.

480
00:19:54.84 --> 00:19:55.84
And it hurts.

481
00:19:55.84 --> 00:19:58.12
He'll make you Ziggy a little bit.

482
00:19:58.12 --> 00:19:59.12
Ziggy.

483
00:19:59.12 --> 00:20:00.12
Sure.

484
00:20:00.12 --> 00:20:02.12
So I was jumping.

485
00:20:02.12 --> 00:20:03.12
I was parachuting.

486
00:20:03.12 --> 00:20:07.12
I had like, this is like, when I was in the tilting.

487
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:08.12
Oh, okay.

488
00:20:08.12 --> 00:20:09.12
That's like this one.

489
00:20:09.12 --> 00:20:10.12
I was parachuting.

490
00:20:10.12 --> 00:20:12.60
And I didn't have that many jumps, right?

491
00:20:12.60 --> 00:20:15.12
I wasn't an experienced free fall.

492
00:20:15.12 --> 00:20:17.92
Parachuters, parachute is at this time.

493
00:20:17.92 --> 00:20:24.56
And the guy we were going jumping with was an extremely experienced, highly experienced.

494
00:20:24.56 --> 00:20:26.76
Thousands and thousands of parachute jumps.

495
00:20:26.76 --> 00:20:30.20
And he took a crew of us and we were all pretty much new jumpers.

496
00:20:30.20 --> 00:20:32.48
We didn't know what the hell we were doing.

497
00:20:32.48 --> 00:20:38.76
And so we go up and there is a ceiling, meaning that the clouds are low.

498
00:20:38.76 --> 00:20:41.36
And so we can't get to full altitude.

499
00:20:41.36 --> 00:20:44.64
And so he goes, hey guys, we can't get up to altitude.

500
00:20:44.64 --> 00:20:45.64
We're in the aircraft.

501
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:49.12
This is almost, you know, this is one of those cheesy like a movie type scene where we're

502
00:20:49.12 --> 00:20:50.12
in the aircraft.

503
00:20:50.12 --> 00:20:52.32
And he's kind of yelling like what's going on to us.

504
00:20:52.32 --> 00:20:55.08
Yeah, like I'm playing for a new guy's in this guy was a master chief in Isaac.

505
00:20:55.08 --> 00:20:56.08
He's like, hey guys.

506
00:20:56.08 --> 00:20:58.68
We can't get up to altitude.

507
00:20:58.68 --> 00:21:01.84
We're going to just do a hop and pop at three grand or something like that.

508
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:04.36
Meaning we're just going to go in a very low altitude.

509
00:21:04.36 --> 00:21:07.72
Just going to jump out and pop our parachutes.

510
00:21:07.72 --> 00:21:09.04
And I'm sitting there.

511
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:10.84
I've never even done a hop and pop before.

512
00:21:10.84 --> 00:21:13.64
I barely knew how to get stable coming out of an aircraft.

513
00:21:13.64 --> 00:21:16.44
The way you go through, we used to go through free fall school.

514
00:21:16.44 --> 00:21:23.08
It was like a rapid, rapid evolution where if you did correct on one jump, they moved

515
00:21:23.08 --> 00:21:24.08
in the next one.

516
00:21:24.08 --> 00:21:26.56
It did my jumps correctly so I didn't have a lot of jumps.

517
00:21:26.56 --> 00:21:31.04
So then we get this guy's saying, and I only jumped at 13,000 feet before this.

518
00:21:31.04 --> 00:21:35.16
So you have all kinds of time if you mess up on your exit, which if you don't know when

519
00:21:35.16 --> 00:21:38.84
you jump out of an aircraft when you're inexperienced, you can get spun around as a matter

520
00:21:38.84 --> 00:21:43.04
of fact Andy Stump talked about how he started spinning out of control and it happens.

521
00:21:43.04 --> 00:21:45.84
Well, when you're at 13,000 feet, you start spinning.

522
00:21:45.84 --> 00:21:46.84
It's okay.

523
00:21:46.84 --> 00:21:48.08
You find your body position.

524
00:21:48.08 --> 00:21:49.08
You get stable.

525
00:21:49.08 --> 00:21:50.76
We called it flat, dumb and happy.

526
00:21:50.76 --> 00:21:53.40
Meaning you're falling flat and everything is stable and good.

527
00:21:53.40 --> 00:21:54.40
And then you can pull your parachute.

528
00:21:54.40 --> 00:21:55.40
And it's fine.

529
00:21:55.40 --> 00:21:58.88
Well, at 3000 feet, you don't have time to do any of that.

530
00:21:58.88 --> 00:22:03.40
So when you come out, you basically have to come out and immediately adapt to the air stream

531
00:22:03.40 --> 00:22:07.40
of the aircraft and you have to get yourself stable and then you need to pull really quickly.

532
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:11.72
And so I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm kind of thinking as I have no idea how to do this.

533
00:22:11.72 --> 00:22:16.12
And I've, I know that I've messed up a bunch of exits and I knew that I got an unstable

534
00:22:16.12 --> 00:22:21.28
a bunch of times jumping out and you know it just find my time and get stable and be cool.

535
00:22:21.28 --> 00:22:23.28
So anyways, this is Mastery of Tech.

536
00:22:23.28 --> 00:22:25.28
Guys, we can't get to altitude.

537
00:22:25.28 --> 00:22:28.56
We're just going to do a hop and pop at 3000 feet.

538
00:22:28.56 --> 00:22:33.68
And I'm thinking to myself, okay, there's a limited chance that I'm going to make this exit

539
00:22:33.68 --> 00:22:35.000
properly.

540
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.24
And I think I said something along the lines of like, hey, hey, Master Chief, I've never

541
00:22:39.24 --> 00:22:40.88
done a hop and pop before.

542
00:22:40.88 --> 00:22:43.52
You know, because we're yelling an aircraft to get here and you think I'm like, I've

543
00:22:43.52 --> 00:22:45.36
never done a hop and pop before.

544
00:22:45.36 --> 00:22:47.60
Look, what's any thing, any pointers?

545
00:22:47.60 --> 00:22:51.000
And it was me and all my buddies none of us had done it before.

546
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.24
And he goes, yeah, he's no big deal.

547
00:22:53.24 --> 00:22:56.76
You just go out, just count to three and pull.

548
00:22:56.76 --> 00:23:01.12
And I go Roger that and then he goes, just don't Ziggy the exit.

549
00:23:01.12 --> 00:23:02.12
That's what he says.

550
00:23:02.12 --> 00:23:06.08
Just don't Ziggy the exit, meaning don't don't have a bad exit, which like at this

551
00:23:06.08 --> 00:23:10.12
point, like I said, I was probably batting 50% bad exits because I just didn't know what

552
00:23:10.12 --> 00:23:11.12
I was doing.

553
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:12.76
So of course, what did I do?

554
00:23:12.76 --> 00:23:13.76
Okay, fine.

555
00:23:13.76 --> 00:23:17.000
I'll just jump if I Ziggy the exit and die.

556
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Cool.

557
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
So weak.

558
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.20
But at least I tried to hit it.

559
00:23:22.20 --> 00:23:23.76
So don't Ziggy the exit.

560
00:23:23.76 --> 00:23:24.76
So what?

561
00:23:24.76 --> 00:23:25.60
Oh, so I went out.

562
00:23:25.60 --> 00:23:27.12
I didn't Ziggy the exit.

563
00:23:27.12 --> 00:23:28.64
Oh, actually, you know what?

564
00:23:28.64 --> 00:23:32.28
When the pressure's on, you rise, you know?

565
00:23:32.28 --> 00:23:33.12
You rise.

566
00:23:33.12 --> 00:23:34.12
You hope to rise.

567
00:23:34.12 --> 00:23:35.84
I always feel better.

568
00:23:35.84 --> 00:23:37.76
You don't take surfing without a leash.

569
00:23:37.76 --> 00:23:39.80
You know what, the leash is, right?

570
00:23:39.80 --> 00:23:41.000
Do you know, I mean, you're from Hawaii.

571
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Yeah, I know at least.

572
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Thank you.

573
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Some people wear a leash.

574
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Some people don't.

575
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.24
When I wear a leash, which I don't like to, you can make mistakes.

576
00:23:50.24 --> 00:23:52.40
There's no, there's no price to be paid.

577
00:23:52.40 --> 00:23:54.64
Because all you do is you fall on your board to write there with you.

578
00:23:54.64 --> 00:24:00.48
When you don't have a rope on or a leash on, when you fall, your board is gone.

579
00:24:00.48 --> 00:24:01.76
You have to swim for it.

580
00:24:01.76 --> 00:24:03.04
It's a pain.

581
00:24:03.04 --> 00:24:04.04
It can hit people.

582
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:05.04
It's hazardous.

583
00:24:05.04 --> 00:24:06.04
It's dangerous.

584
00:24:06.04 --> 00:24:07.64
All these things.

585
00:24:07.64 --> 00:24:11.16
When I surf with a leash on, I surf like crap when I surf with no rope, which

586
00:24:11.16 --> 00:24:12.16
I prefer.

587
00:24:12.16 --> 00:24:16.60
I surf better because if you don't make, if you Ziggy that, you Ziggy that drop it.

588
00:24:16.60 --> 00:24:17.60
Your board's gone.

589
00:24:17.60 --> 00:24:18.60
You're going to hurt somebody.

590
00:24:18.60 --> 00:24:19.60
It's a nightmare.

591
00:24:19.60 --> 00:24:21.96
So, yeah, makes sense.

592
00:24:21.96 --> 00:24:25.84
And I'll tell you, my son the other day, there was big waves.

593
00:24:25.84 --> 00:24:31.24
I mean, not big waves from Hawaii and standpoint, but San Diego big waves.

594
00:24:31.24 --> 00:24:37.24
And he's just on a long board, no rope, just dropping it on.

595
00:24:37.24 --> 00:24:39.52
I was pretty impressed.

596
00:24:39.52 --> 00:24:44.04
And actually, especially because I have a little bit of a tweak shoulder right now.

597
00:24:44.04 --> 00:24:50.52
So, I was wearing a leash because I can't quite grip my board as much as I need to.

598
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:51.52
All right.

599
00:24:51.52 --> 00:24:54.52
And so, I'm sitting out there wearing a leash and he's out there.

600
00:24:54.52 --> 00:24:56.52
No rope, kidding you.

601
00:24:56.52 --> 00:24:57.52
I'm trying to hit him.

602
00:24:57.52 --> 00:24:59.16
It's like, okay, that's cool.

603
00:24:59.16 --> 00:25:00.16
Impressive.

604
00:25:00.16 --> 00:25:01.16
Impressive.

605
00:25:01.16 --> 00:25:02.16
I don't know.

606
00:25:02.16 --> 00:25:03.16
I don't know.

607
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:04.16
It was like that though.

608
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:05.16
Not it was, oh, that they rise the pressure.

609
00:25:05.16 --> 00:25:06.72
Yeah, like the, or even in your case, seems like you prefer the pressure.

610
00:25:06.72 --> 00:25:07.72
I prefer the pressure.

611
00:25:07.72 --> 00:25:08.72
I prefer the pressure.

612
00:25:08.72 --> 00:25:09.72
I prefer the pressure.

613
00:25:09.72 --> 00:25:10.72
I prefer the pressure.

614
00:25:10.72 --> 00:25:12.72
I prefer the pressure.

615
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:13.72
I prefer the pressure.

616
00:25:13.72 --> 00:25:14.64
I prefer the pressure.

617
00:25:14.64 --> 00:25:15.64
So, I prefer the pressure.

618
00:25:15.64 --> 00:25:18.28
Or for making a mistake.

619
00:25:18.28 --> 00:25:19.40
There's just less reward, right?

620
00:25:19.40 --> 00:25:20.44
You want more reward.

621
00:25:20.44 --> 00:25:21.44
Yeah.

622
00:25:21.44 --> 00:25:23.36
Yeah, it's like rolling with people that you're better than, you know?

623
00:25:23.36 --> 00:25:24.36
You know what?

624
00:25:24.36 --> 00:25:25.36
You know what?

625
00:25:25.36 --> 00:25:26.36
You know what?

626
00:25:26.36 --> 00:25:27.36
You know what?

627
00:25:27.36 --> 00:25:28.84
You want to, you want to feel a challenge.

628
00:25:28.84 --> 00:25:30.04
Right?

629
00:25:30.04 --> 00:25:31.04
You know?

630
00:25:31.04 --> 00:25:33.04
You want to feel a challenge.

631
00:25:33.04 --> 00:25:34.04
Right?

632
00:25:34.04 --> 00:25:35.04
You know?

633
00:25:35.04 --> 00:25:36.04
Yeah.

634
00:25:36.04 --> 00:25:37.04
And that makes sense.

635
00:25:37.04 --> 00:25:39.64
But I guess it's like the standard is different with use.

636
00:25:39.64 --> 00:25:40.64
Because like, let's fit.

637
00:25:40.64 --> 00:25:43.12
I was a smugger back in the day.

638
00:25:43.12 --> 00:25:44.44
riding a boogie boogie boogie.

639
00:25:44.44 --> 00:25:45.88
Body, we call it body-boarding.

640
00:25:45.88 --> 00:25:46.72
Yeah.

641
00:25:46.72 --> 00:25:49.12
Anyway, same thing, leash and no leash.

642
00:25:49.12 --> 00:25:52.16
But if you're shredding big waves,

643
00:25:53.64 --> 00:25:54.84
right, you want that leash.

644
00:25:54.84 --> 00:25:57.88
Because it's some people, I was one of those people

645
00:25:57.88 --> 00:25:59.08
where if you don't have a leash, it's like,

646
00:25:59.08 --> 00:26:01.24
okay, I'm now I'm thinking about that a little bit.

647
00:26:01.24 --> 00:26:02.32
No, it's on my mind.

648
00:26:02.32 --> 00:26:04.16
Rather than you don't have to think about that,

649
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:06.48
I can just think about this wave shredding.

650
00:26:06.48 --> 00:26:07.48
I can just think about shredding.

651
00:26:07.48 --> 00:26:08.32
Yeah.

652
00:26:08.32 --> 00:26:10.04
So, you have that situation,

653
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:12.16
but you are as a perfect analogy with the,

654
00:26:12.16 --> 00:26:14.96
you just guys like, let's say, you're a black belt.

655
00:26:14.96 --> 00:26:17.40
And, you know, whatever you get matched up

656
00:26:17.40 --> 00:26:19.12
with a white belt, boom, timer goes off.

657
00:26:19.12 --> 00:26:20.72
And then, let's say it's a white belt

658
00:26:20.72 --> 00:26:21.92
that you've rolled with before.

659
00:26:21.92 --> 00:26:26.60
So, you not only do you expect to be better than him?

660
00:26:26.60 --> 00:26:27.44
Yeah, actually good.

661
00:26:27.44 --> 00:26:28.28
You actually know it.

662
00:26:28.28 --> 00:26:29.12
Yeah.

663
00:26:29.12 --> 00:26:30.12
And there's no path.

664
00:26:30.12 --> 00:26:33.36
So, yeah, your body straight up has no,

665
00:26:33.36 --> 00:26:35.96
essentially no motivation, no incentive

666
00:26:35.96 --> 00:26:38.80
to quote unquote perform, same thing.

667
00:26:38.80 --> 00:26:39.64
Yeah.

668
00:26:39.64 --> 00:26:41.04
But I think with these types of things,

669
00:26:41.04 --> 00:26:43.000
like it's just a different standard though.

670
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.56
Some people in your case, apparently,

671
00:26:45.56 --> 00:26:48.12
you feel that in surfing with the leash,

672
00:26:48.12 --> 00:26:50.24
but I think some people that at the same time,

673
00:26:50.24 --> 00:26:52.08
it's like wearing a mouthpiece too, you know?

674
00:26:52.08 --> 00:26:52.92
Yeah.

675
00:26:52.92 --> 00:26:54.24
It'll be like, oh yeah.

676
00:26:54.24 --> 00:26:56.28
You know, but that's not smart.

677
00:26:56.28 --> 00:26:57.12
What?

678
00:26:57.12 --> 00:26:57.96
Not wearing a mouthpiece.

679
00:26:57.96 --> 00:27:01.68
But no, not jujitsu, but if you start stand up,

680
00:27:01.68 --> 00:27:04.20
yeah, it's like boxing or kick boxing,

681
00:27:04.20 --> 00:27:06.04
without a mouthpiece and it's not smart.

682
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:08.92
Yeah, but I've done a ton of stupidly.

683
00:27:08.92 --> 00:27:11.60
Yeah, but think of that mindset there,

684
00:27:11.60 --> 00:27:13.76
where it's like, yeah, I don't know where my mouthpiece,

685
00:27:13.76 --> 00:27:15.36
that way when someone hits me,

686
00:27:15.36 --> 00:27:17.84
it the cost is greater, you know?

687
00:27:17.84 --> 00:27:19.84
So it'll add some pressure to talk about.

688
00:27:19.84 --> 00:27:22.000
I think dental damage.

689
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Yeah, that's a little damage.

690
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.84
It's supposed to face losing your boogie board in the,

691
00:27:27.84 --> 00:27:30.68
to the shore where you got to swim a little bit more.

692
00:27:30.68 --> 00:27:32.08
Yeah, man, same deal.

693
00:27:32.08 --> 00:27:33.32
Jack, all right.

694
00:27:33.32 --> 00:27:34.96
Next question.

695
00:27:34.96 --> 00:27:37.96
What's your name?

696
00:27:37.96 --> 00:27:41.96
Boxing or jujitsu for a seven year old boy?

697
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:47.04
Jujitsu all day on that one.

698
00:27:47.04 --> 00:27:48.40
It's a couple reasons.

699
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:49.60
It's fun.

700
00:27:49.60 --> 00:27:50.60
It's active.

701
00:27:50.60 --> 00:27:53.60
So you can actually fight the other person.

702
00:27:53.60 --> 00:27:56.24
And it's real fighting and it's what they're used to.

703
00:27:56.24 --> 00:27:58.40
And so many often when parents come in

704
00:27:58.40 --> 00:27:59.92
and they bring their kid in for the first time,

705
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:02.56
or now it's weak to and the parents are,

706
00:28:02.56 --> 00:28:03.92
oh, they just love it so much.

707
00:28:03.92 --> 00:28:05.72
And yeah, they're doing what they want to do.

708
00:28:05.72 --> 00:28:08.24
What they're, what they instinctually want to do.

709
00:28:08.24 --> 00:28:12.44
Go look at dogs, go look at cats, go look at any animal

710
00:28:12.44 --> 00:28:14.84
out there in the animal kingdom.

711
00:28:14.84 --> 00:28:15.68
You know what they do?

712
00:28:15.68 --> 00:28:16.84
They grapple with each other.

713
00:28:16.84 --> 00:28:19.80
And they actually do submissions, right?

714
00:28:19.80 --> 00:28:22.84
They, if you watch like a wolf pack,

715
00:28:22.84 --> 00:28:26.44
when that dominating wolf gets the throat of the weaker wolf,

716
00:28:26.44 --> 00:28:29.60
the submissive wolf, he doesn't rip his throat out.

717
00:28:29.60 --> 00:28:31.80
The guy taps out, game over.

718
00:28:31.80 --> 00:28:36.28
He now he knows that he's the alpha now, but it's the same thing.

719
00:28:36.28 --> 00:28:40.88
So you know, you watch little lions or tigers.

720
00:28:40.88 --> 00:28:42.24
They wrestle with each other.

721
00:28:42.24 --> 00:28:43.56
They don't kill each other.

722
00:28:43.56 --> 00:28:44.40
They tap out.

723
00:28:44.40 --> 00:28:45.48
They get submissive.

724
00:28:45.48 --> 00:28:46.64
They say, oh yeah, you won.

725
00:28:46.64 --> 00:28:49.40
So it's very natural and very instinctive to do.

726
00:28:49.40 --> 00:28:52.32
So yeah, Gigiitsu all day long.

727
00:28:52.32 --> 00:28:55.56
Now it's important to develop your striking.

728
00:28:55.56 --> 00:29:00.56
And you can do that training boxing on two times a week.

729
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:02.24
So just get in there and learn how to throw it.

730
00:29:02.24 --> 00:29:07.32
It's really, it's really pretty sad when you, when you meet a grown man

731
00:29:07.32 --> 00:29:08.96
that does not have a throw punch, right?

732
00:29:08.96 --> 00:29:09.96
That's just not good.

733
00:29:09.96 --> 00:29:12.88
You should know how to throw punch because if you get in a fight,

734
00:29:12.88 --> 00:29:14.56
the fights are going to start standing.

735
00:29:14.56 --> 00:29:18.80
And if all you know how to do is try and double like someone,

736
00:29:18.80 --> 00:29:20.08
you don't always want to do that.

737
00:29:20.08 --> 00:29:24.32
In fact, you prefer to knock the person out in many cases.

738
00:29:24.32 --> 00:29:30.32
So learn how to throw strikes, but I will say as far as seven year olds

739
00:29:30.32 --> 00:29:34.88
getting in there and sparring two young, two young, all kinds of brain

740
00:29:34.88 --> 00:29:36.28
developments still going on.

741
00:29:36.28 --> 00:29:38.24
Head trauma is head trauma.

742
00:29:38.24 --> 00:29:42.44
You're not going to get better at it as you get older.

743
00:29:42.44 --> 00:29:43.76
By it, well, I shouldn't say that.

744
00:29:43.76 --> 00:29:46.72
You're not going to get better at it by taking more punches.

745
00:29:46.72 --> 00:29:49.76
The more you get punched in the head, the worse you're going to be at it.

746
00:29:49.76 --> 00:29:50.40
Period.

747
00:29:50.40 --> 00:29:51.08
End of story.

748
00:29:51.08 --> 00:29:53.12
Now I shouldn't say period in story.

749
00:29:53.12 --> 00:29:56.84
When you turn 18 or when you turn 17 and you're going to start sparring,

750
00:29:56.84 --> 00:29:59.08
you're going to get better at it for a little bit.

751
00:29:59.08 --> 00:30:01.36
Because you're going to get used to it.

752
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:02.76
You're going to understand how the reaction.

753
00:30:02.76 --> 00:30:05.80
You're going to know how to deal with the little white flash that hits you.

754
00:30:05.80 --> 00:30:09.92
You're going to become comfortable in that uncomfortable scenario.

755
00:30:09.92 --> 00:30:15.24
But that uptick of increased improvement is very short.

756
00:30:15.24 --> 00:30:19.64
And very quickly, you reach the other side of that, which is every time you get

757
00:30:19.64 --> 00:30:27.04
punched in the head, you're taking your brain resilience backwards.

758
00:30:27.04 --> 00:30:34.08
So do boxing, learn it, throw punches, hit pads, note, make sure you know how to throw

759
00:30:34.08 --> 00:30:35.08
a punch.

760
00:30:35.08 --> 00:30:41.28
And you take a kid that's 10 years old that knows how to throw a 1, 2, 3 combo.

761
00:30:41.28 --> 00:30:43.12
And he gets in a street fight.

762
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:44.12
He knows Gjitsu and boxing.

763
00:30:44.12 --> 00:30:46.28
He's not even getting into the Gjitsu part.

764
00:30:46.28 --> 00:30:48.24
Because he throws a 1, 2, 3 combo.

765
00:30:48.24 --> 00:30:54.16
And he's knocking out just about every other kid or at least he's putting them down.

766
00:30:54.16 --> 00:30:58.72
Or at least at least he's shown that that kid is going to go away.

767
00:30:58.72 --> 00:31:00.60
This person knows how to fight and I don't.

768
00:31:00.60 --> 00:31:01.84
Because it is hard to knock people out.

769
00:31:01.84 --> 00:31:05.80
I don't care, even to even a skilled boxer will have a hard time knocking out a random

770
00:31:05.80 --> 00:31:06.80
person in the street.

771
00:31:06.80 --> 00:31:08.24
Because it's hard to knock someone out.

772
00:31:08.24 --> 00:31:09.64
Harder.

773
00:31:09.64 --> 00:31:16.16
So yes, Gjitsu all day long for the 7 year old and do a little bit of striking to get

774
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:17.16
them familiar with it.

775
00:31:17.16 --> 00:31:19.16
Yeah, Gjitsu is way funnier too.

776
00:31:19.16 --> 00:31:21.44
And of course, it sounds like a matter of opinion.

777
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:24.04
But just how you said grappling stuff is natural.

778
00:31:24.04 --> 00:31:29.24
Even if you get to brothers who don't take Gjitsu at all, no wrestling, no nothing, you

779
00:31:29.24 --> 00:31:30.84
say, go play outside.

780
00:31:30.84 --> 00:31:32.24
They're going to start and no ball, no nothing.

781
00:31:32.24 --> 00:31:34.76
They're going to mess around and chances are they're going to start.

782
00:31:34.76 --> 00:31:38.28
One guy is going to be pinning the other guy on the ground, pinning his hands or whatever.

783
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:39.28
And that's kind of part of it.

784
00:31:39.28 --> 00:31:42.16
So Gjitsu, it's basically Gjitsu is just that.

785
00:31:42.16 --> 00:31:46.88
It's literally just that except for there's actual skills in there so they can get good at

786
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:48.76
that thing that they're looking at.

787
00:31:48.76 --> 00:31:53.72
And that's one of the reasons that boxing or striking kick because I should say boxing,

788
00:31:53.72 --> 00:31:56.04
kick boxing, moi tie, whatever.

789
00:31:56.04 --> 00:31:58.96
There's a reason why it's a little bit boring if you're not sparring because now you're

790
00:31:58.96 --> 00:31:59.96
not sparring.

791
00:31:59.96 --> 00:32:00.96
You're hitting pads.

792
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:02.56
You're hitting, it's just not as fun.

793
00:32:02.56 --> 00:32:03.56
It is cool.

794
00:32:03.56 --> 00:32:04.56
And it's good.

795
00:32:04.56 --> 00:32:08.72
And I'll tell you what, I've been to Thailand and it's awesome seeing the young kids that are

796
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:10.60
training like that all the time.

797
00:32:10.60 --> 00:32:12.84
You drive down the streets in Thailand.

798
00:32:12.84 --> 00:32:16.12
Just like in America, you see guys shooting hoops, or you see kids shooting hoops, you see

799
00:32:16.12 --> 00:32:17.68
kids playing catch the baseball.

800
00:32:17.68 --> 00:32:19.24
The kids there are doing more time.

801
00:32:19.24 --> 00:32:20.56
That's what they're doing.

802
00:32:20.56 --> 00:32:21.92
That's that is badass.

803
00:32:21.92 --> 00:32:23.92
But that's a traditional thing.

804
00:32:23.92 --> 00:32:24.92
Yeah.

805
00:32:24.92 --> 00:32:26.12
And when that's all around you, that's what we do.

806
00:32:26.12 --> 00:32:27.12
That's what us kids.

807
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:29.72
Just like soccer, like certain places you're going to see more people playing soccer.

808
00:32:29.72 --> 00:32:31.12
They're using the same playing basketball.

809
00:32:31.12 --> 00:32:32.12
Oh yeah, of course.

810
00:32:32.12 --> 00:32:33.12
No, traditional thing.

811
00:32:33.12 --> 00:32:36.92
But I'm saying even at that young age, they do find it entertaining.

812
00:32:36.92 --> 00:32:41.52
And they, and they're also our ways to sparring.

813
00:32:41.52 --> 00:32:44.44
If you can do it correctly, that is like light sparring.

814
00:32:44.44 --> 00:32:45.68
It's almost like you're playing tag.

815
00:32:45.68 --> 00:32:46.68
I call a playing tag.

816
00:32:46.68 --> 00:32:48.56
You can kind of play tag with a person.

817
00:32:48.56 --> 00:32:52.92
You're aren't proving your skills, but you're not getting head brain trauma.

818
00:32:52.92 --> 00:32:54.52
And that's actually a good point.

819
00:32:54.52 --> 00:32:55.52
So playing tag?

820
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:56.52
Yeah.

821
00:32:56.52 --> 00:32:58.96
Because even if you're not training boxing, you'll do that anyway.

822
00:32:58.96 --> 00:33:03.08
You know, with your brothers, like slap boxing, we used to go before actually took

823
00:33:03.08 --> 00:33:10.12
you, Jitsu when we just watched UFC, where the waist greasy videos, we play slap MMA.

824
00:33:10.12 --> 00:33:11.12
Basically.

825
00:33:11.12 --> 00:33:12.48
So it's slap boxing.

826
00:33:12.48 --> 00:33:14.44
You can kick them in the legs or whatever.

827
00:33:14.44 --> 00:33:16.56
And even if you get them on the ground, your ground upon is just slap

828
00:33:16.56 --> 00:33:17.56
him in the face.

829
00:33:17.56 --> 00:33:18.56
We do that.

830
00:33:18.56 --> 00:33:22.44
And that's fun even if you don't know Jitsu or boxing or anything.

831
00:33:22.44 --> 00:33:23.44
So that's right.

832
00:33:23.44 --> 00:33:24.44
I think that you're right about that.

833
00:33:24.44 --> 00:33:29.60
In that case where you just have to be careful of kids getting hit.

834
00:33:29.60 --> 00:33:33.60
You kids and adults getting hit repeatedly in the head with legit strikes.

835
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:35.20
It's just not good for you period.

836
00:33:35.20 --> 00:33:36.20
Yeah.

837
00:33:36.20 --> 00:33:42.000
And that's kind of a slippery slope too when you're like, oh, seven year old boy, I want

838
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.56
to get them into boxing.

839
00:33:43.56 --> 00:33:44.56
You know.

840
00:33:44.56 --> 00:33:45.56
So obviously there's a spectrum there.

841
00:33:45.56 --> 00:33:46.56
It's on one side.

842
00:33:46.56 --> 00:33:50.56
You're like, okay, just get them learn how to throw one, two, learn the, you know,

843
00:33:50.56 --> 00:33:52.04
what else is important to say to you.

844
00:33:52.04 --> 00:33:56.04
And I just thought of this is, you said, did you say there's a spectrum?

845
00:33:56.04 --> 00:33:57.04
Yeah.

846
00:33:57.04 --> 00:33:58.04
So there's a spectrum.

847
00:33:58.04 --> 00:34:01.96
There's a spectrum of natural ability to take punches too.

848
00:34:01.96 --> 00:34:06.84
So some people can get punched their whole lives and they're fine in the head.

849
00:34:06.84 --> 00:34:11.20
And you look at some pro-boxers that come out of their boxing career after having wars

850
00:34:11.20 --> 00:34:15.36
and they're cognitively fine.

851
00:34:15.36 --> 00:34:20.000
And there's other guys that go through their careers and they're, they're in rough shape

852
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.28
without getting done.

853
00:34:21.28 --> 00:34:24.80
They have a pugilistic brain syndrome.

854
00:34:24.80 --> 00:34:29.88
I forget the actual name of it, but they have, you know, the boxers brain damage.

855
00:34:29.88 --> 00:34:31.64
And so you don't know who's going to have that.

856
00:34:31.64 --> 00:34:33.60
You don't know if your kids going to have that or not.

857
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:38.08
So if the only way to find out is to test them by giving it to them, that's not a good

858
00:34:38.08 --> 00:34:39.08
way to find out.

859
00:34:39.08 --> 00:34:40.08
It's not worth it.

860
00:34:40.08 --> 00:34:43.12
Even if they want to be a pro-boxer, it's not a good way to find out.

861
00:34:43.12 --> 00:34:47.52
Because you're going to find out when they're doing their first amateur bout and they get

862
00:34:47.52 --> 00:34:50.52
if they get knocked out or, you know, they get bad headaches.

863
00:34:50.52 --> 00:34:51.52
It's a bad situation.

864
00:34:51.52 --> 00:34:52.52
Yeah.

865
00:34:52.52 --> 00:34:56.36
So I think that's one of the reasons why I think due to en- Wrestling is going to get even

866
00:34:56.36 --> 00:35:03.64
more popular because as you look at the UFC evolve, the people are now saying, you know,

867
00:35:03.64 --> 00:35:06.56
all kinds of UFC fighters are saying, hey, I'm not sparring.

868
00:35:06.56 --> 00:35:07.96
I'm barely sparring anymore.

869
00:35:07.96 --> 00:35:09.52
I don't sparring before my fight, right?

870
00:35:09.52 --> 00:35:11.80
Sparring very limited amount.

871
00:35:11.80 --> 00:35:14.40
And so as people are saying that, well, what are you going to do if you're not sparring?

872
00:35:14.40 --> 00:35:15.40
Well, you're hitting pads.

873
00:35:15.40 --> 00:35:16.40
That's cool.

874
00:35:16.40 --> 00:35:17.40
But how you can train?

875
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:18.40
You're going to do your job.

876
00:35:18.40 --> 00:35:19.40
So you're going to do grappling.

877
00:35:19.40 --> 00:35:20.08
That's where you're going to win the fight.

878
00:35:20.08 --> 00:35:25.60
So I think that as the UFC gets more and more popular and as more information comes out

879
00:35:25.60 --> 00:35:31.56
about traumatic brain injuries that come from repetitive hits to the head, I think that

880
00:35:31.56 --> 00:35:38.000
the popularity of boxing and striking training is going to go down and that will force

881
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.04
or cause the popularity of wrestling and juts are to go up.

882
00:35:42.04 --> 00:35:44.04
Yeah, potentially, yeah.

883
00:35:44.04 --> 00:35:45.04
True.

884
00:35:45.04 --> 00:35:50.92
But what I said about the stradming and everything's really a spectrum, but the approach

885
00:35:50.92 --> 00:35:51.92
to it, right?

886
00:35:51.92 --> 00:35:53.52
So let's talk about boxing.

887
00:35:53.52 --> 00:35:54.52
Seven year old boy boxing.

888
00:35:54.52 --> 00:35:57.16
There's a spectrum on one side of the spectrum is, yeah, let's have them learn the

889
00:35:57.16 --> 00:36:00.56
one, two, have them learn a jab, put across on this.

890
00:36:00.56 --> 00:36:04.56
And that school hits some mitts, do a workout, do some jump rope, and do this.

891
00:36:04.56 --> 00:36:08.88
On the other side, the extreme side, do skid, do split in seven days a week.

892
00:36:08.88 --> 00:36:11.68
He's going to be the next Roy Jones Jr or something like that.

893
00:36:11.68 --> 00:36:14.24
And we're going to start on right now, kind of thing.

894
00:36:14.24 --> 00:36:20.000
So in that case, most of the time I would predict is that on the extreme case, the boy is

895
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
not going to take to it as naturally.

896
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.04
Unless it is part of the tradition or something like that.

897
00:36:24.04 --> 00:36:29.000
But you do, too, like I said, it's just so unless you're being that guy, that parent, you

898
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.08
know the one who's like you're going no matter what.

899
00:36:33.08 --> 00:36:37.28
But I think so I think you're, I think naturally they're going to take to something like

900
00:36:37.28 --> 00:36:38.28
you do, too.

901
00:36:38.28 --> 00:36:39.28
Just wait more fun.

902
00:36:39.28 --> 00:36:42.80
And even just the traditional atmosphere of you do, too, is more fun.

903
00:36:42.80 --> 00:36:46.32
You're just, especially in the kids, all those kids are so much fun in there.

904
00:36:46.32 --> 00:36:49.72
They don't barely know that they're doing something instructional in a lot of cases.

905
00:36:49.72 --> 00:36:53.32
They're just, hey, you hold this person here with your knees on each side.

906
00:36:53.32 --> 00:36:54.32
Well, that's the amount.

907
00:36:54.32 --> 00:36:56.48
And the person on the kid on the bottom is learning the amount of scape.

908
00:36:56.48 --> 00:36:58.08
They don't even know it, but they're learning it.

909
00:36:58.08 --> 00:36:59.08
Yeah.

910
00:36:59.08 --> 00:37:00.08
Yeah, that's fun.

911
00:37:00.08 --> 00:37:03.04
Yeah, my daughter doesn't even want to leave.

912
00:37:03.04 --> 00:37:04.04
The gym now.

913
00:37:04.04 --> 00:37:05.04
That's so easy.

914
00:37:05.04 --> 00:37:06.04
Just run around.

915
00:37:06.04 --> 00:37:07.04
Yeah.

916
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:08.04
And think about it, too.

917
00:37:08.04 --> 00:37:09.04
You're in a padded room.

918
00:37:09.04 --> 00:37:10.04
Here's a padded room, do whatever you want.

919
00:37:10.04 --> 00:37:11.04
Yeah.

920
00:37:11.04 --> 00:37:11.04
Go.

921
00:37:11.04 --> 00:37:13.04
Yeah, I'm in the best.

922
00:37:13.04 --> 00:37:15.04
Next question.

923
00:37:15.04 --> 00:37:18.04
Draco, how do you read books to prepare for podcasts?

924
00:37:18.04 --> 00:37:25.28
How do you read a book to extract maximum benefit in advice on keeping yourself focused

925
00:37:25.28 --> 00:37:28.24
and being patient while reading books?

926
00:37:28.24 --> 00:37:34.80
So this was a series of reoccurring questions that were about kind of how I read and it grabbed

927
00:37:34.80 --> 00:37:36.84
three of them that were in there.

928
00:37:36.84 --> 00:37:40.04
So how do I prepare for a podcast?

929
00:37:40.04 --> 00:37:44.24
It's actually a pretty in-depth situation.

930
00:37:44.24 --> 00:37:45.76
So first thing I do is read the book.

931
00:37:45.76 --> 00:37:47.08
Has reading the book a highlight?

932
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:53.04
Anything that I find to be interesting or informative to me or reinforce an idea that I

933
00:37:53.04 --> 00:37:55.08
know or bring a new idea to bear.

934
00:37:55.08 --> 00:37:57.64
So as I'm going through, I'm just highlighting everything.

935
00:37:57.64 --> 00:38:03.24
When I get done with it, now just to say when we're talking max benefit, when I was in college

936
00:38:03.24 --> 00:38:09.64
and I would do that, I would once I got done with highlighting the areas that I found informative

937
00:38:09.64 --> 00:38:13.24
and important, then I would make flashcards of the highlighted areas.

938
00:38:13.24 --> 00:38:15.64
So I was like double locking the information.

939
00:38:15.64 --> 00:38:19.84
Because when you, as soon as I make a flashcard, I've already got it 50% in my mind.

940
00:38:19.84 --> 00:38:20.84
Well, I read it.

941
00:38:20.84 --> 00:38:21.84
I highlighted it.

942
00:38:21.84 --> 00:38:23.64
It was like 25%.

943
00:38:23.64 --> 00:38:25.92
Make a flashcard?

944
00:38:25.92 --> 00:38:28.92
That's another 45% or 50%.

945
00:38:28.92 --> 00:38:33.68
And so boom, now I got to do a study of the flashcard for that last 25% to lock in the knowledge

946
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:38.84
where when I go in to take the test, I know 100% I know, I'm going to know every answer

947
00:38:38.84 --> 00:38:39.84
on the question.

948
00:38:39.84 --> 00:38:44.28
When you recall, like a thing, you actually recall what the flashcards did.

949
00:38:44.28 --> 00:38:45.28
Yes.

950
00:38:45.28 --> 00:38:46.28
Yes.

951
00:38:46.28 --> 00:38:47.28
You wrote the A and that one, you know?

952
00:38:47.28 --> 00:38:48.28
Yes.

953
00:38:48.28 --> 00:38:49.28
So that's what I would do.

954
00:38:49.28 --> 00:38:51.68
This is kind of a side track when I was in college.

955
00:38:51.68 --> 00:38:55.60
Highlight and then make flashcards of what I highlighted.

956
00:38:55.60 --> 00:39:01.40
Now, for the podcast, what I do is once I read it and highlight it, now I go back

957
00:39:01.40 --> 00:39:06.60
through and I look at the highlights and now I start being selective of what is going

958
00:39:06.60 --> 00:39:09.20
to be in the podcast.

959
00:39:09.20 --> 00:39:14.04
And I actually circle the actual words I'm going to read with a red pen that I'm holding

960
00:39:14.04 --> 00:39:15.04
right here.

961
00:39:15.04 --> 00:39:16.04
And that's what I do.

962
00:39:16.04 --> 00:39:20.88
I circle and then I have little notes that say next, like when I circle a section,

963
00:39:20.88 --> 00:39:24.40
and then I'll even have an arrow that goes to another point or I'll have a little note

964
00:39:24.40 --> 00:39:29.52
that says, go to page 49 and then there'll be a tab.

965
00:39:29.52 --> 00:39:32.24
One of those yellow sticky tabs on page 49 boom, there it is.

966
00:39:32.24 --> 00:39:33.40
I can flip right there real quick.

967
00:39:33.40 --> 00:39:34.80
So we don't have to edit.

968
00:39:34.80 --> 00:39:36.44
We don't have to, there's a flow.

969
00:39:36.44 --> 00:39:37.80
I can keep rolling.

970
00:39:37.80 --> 00:39:43.04
And then on top of those, when I get to, when I read something and I want to say something

971
00:39:43.04 --> 00:39:47.28
about it, I have little sticky notes that I put in there.

972
00:39:47.28 --> 00:39:48.28
Either sticky notes.

973
00:39:48.28 --> 00:39:51.60
I have the sticky tape stuff, which is pretty legit.

974
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:54.36
And I just rolled out, I stick it on there and I say, hey,

975
00:39:54.36 --> 00:39:59.40
I mentioned, you know, experience I had here or what happened when I was doing this.

976
00:39:59.40 --> 00:40:04.28
And so I kind of make those notes in that way, I can get it done.

977
00:40:04.28 --> 00:40:08.72
And while I'm doing that is when I have to figure out the chronology that I'm going

978
00:40:08.72 --> 00:40:14.28
to read it because I don't always read the notes from the book on the podcast in the same

979
00:40:14.28 --> 00:40:20.12
order that they are in the book because sometimes it just doesn't make sense.

980
00:40:20.12 --> 00:40:23.56
Sometimes there's some, so at the same time I'm doing that, I'm going back and figure

981
00:40:23.56 --> 00:40:26.40
out what direction I'm actually going to read them.

982
00:40:26.40 --> 00:40:27.40
All right.

983
00:40:27.40 --> 00:40:32.32
So sometimes my conclusion of the book is different than the authors conclusion of the book.

984
00:40:32.32 --> 00:40:33.32
Yeah.

985
00:40:33.32 --> 00:40:36.24
So I got to go back and say, I got to go back pages or forward or whatever.

986
00:40:36.24 --> 00:40:39.28
So that's what I'm figuring out there as well.

987
00:40:39.28 --> 00:40:43.000
So that's kind of what the podcast prep looks like.

988
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.76
Now how to stay focused in patient while reading books.

989
00:40:46.76 --> 00:40:47.88
This is really difficult.

990
00:40:47.88 --> 00:40:50.88
I don't have a long attention span.

991
00:40:50.88 --> 00:40:56.88
And I have a long attention span, it's only because I absolutely force myself to do it.

992
00:40:56.88 --> 00:41:02.40
So what I would prefer to do is to read in small chunks.

993
00:41:02.40 --> 00:41:05.20
I want to do work for like an hour to time, right?

994
00:41:05.20 --> 00:41:07.04
When I'm writing, I want to work for about an hour.

995
00:41:07.04 --> 00:41:08.88
When I'm reading, I want to read for about an hour.

996
00:41:08.88 --> 00:41:14.44
After that, I want to get up and break something or throw something or lift something or

997
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:15.44
run somewhere.

998
00:41:15.44 --> 00:41:16.44
You know what I mean?

999
00:41:16.44 --> 00:41:20.36
It's, I have an hour of patience with me.

1000
00:41:20.36 --> 00:41:22.64
Unfortunately, that's not enough time.

1001
00:41:22.64 --> 00:41:25.84
You know, especially when you're doing a podcast a week and you got to read a whole book.

1002
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:26.84
Well, guess what?

1003
00:41:26.84 --> 00:41:27.84
You got to read for longer.

1004
00:41:27.84 --> 00:41:31.32
You got to read for two, three hours at a pop.

1005
00:41:31.32 --> 00:41:35.96
I'll try and make it that I do an hour early in the morning.

1006
00:41:35.96 --> 00:41:39.56
Sometimes when I'm behind the curve, I will read first thing in the morning before I

1007
00:41:39.56 --> 00:41:42.12
work out because I just want to get an hour done.

1008
00:41:42.12 --> 00:41:44.12
Then I get to go and release.

1009
00:41:44.12 --> 00:41:45.12
Right?

1010
00:41:45.12 --> 00:41:46.32
Then I get done with the workout, take a shower.

1011
00:41:46.32 --> 00:41:48.04
Now I'm going to read for another 45 minutes.

1012
00:41:48.04 --> 00:41:49.04
Okay, good.

1013
00:41:49.04 --> 00:41:52.08
Now I'll do something else, little pre-lunch reading.

1014
00:41:52.08 --> 00:41:56.08
So, and then before I go to bed, I'm doing another hour.

1015
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:00.48
So there, I just got four or five hours in a day without having to sit down and do something

1016
00:42:00.48 --> 00:42:03.80
for four or five straight hours, which bothers the hell out of me.

1017
00:42:03.80 --> 00:42:09.88
The other thing you can do, and I do this, is I'll read multiple books at the same time,

1018
00:42:09.88 --> 00:42:12.16
which is an interesting task.

1019
00:42:12.16 --> 00:42:13.16
I attack.

1020
00:42:13.16 --> 00:42:16.96
I don't know if everybody should do that or could do that or would want to do that.

1021
00:42:16.96 --> 00:42:19.56
But sometimes one book gets boring.

1022
00:42:19.56 --> 00:42:20.76
But I know I got to read.

1023
00:42:20.76 --> 00:42:25.12
So I just have two books, three books all sitting there and I'm reading them all at the same

1024
00:42:25.12 --> 00:42:26.12
time.

1025
00:42:26.12 --> 00:42:30.20
And that makes them a little bit more interesting.

1026
00:42:30.20 --> 00:42:36.56
And the last thing I would say about trying to be focused on inpatient when you're reading

1027
00:42:36.56 --> 00:42:46.92
books is to try to really understand what it is that is happening in the book.

1028
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:51.56
Not just from a plot perspective, but from a human perspective.

1029
00:42:51.56 --> 00:42:54.16
What is that person going through?

1030
00:42:54.16 --> 00:42:57.16
What is that like for that person?

1031
00:42:57.16 --> 00:42:58.72
What are they thinking?

1032
00:42:58.72 --> 00:43:04.08
And I get to a point where I'm so engaged, I feel like I'm becoming the off.

1033
00:43:04.08 --> 00:43:06.60
I feel like I'm in the book sometimes when I'm reading it.

1034
00:43:06.60 --> 00:43:11.08
So that is another good way to keep it engaging.

1035
00:43:11.08 --> 00:43:15.24
Because if you're seeing it from the outside and you're not really in it, well then it's

1036
00:43:15.24 --> 00:43:17.32
just not as engaging simply put.

1037
00:43:17.32 --> 00:43:21.84
If you get into it and you start thinking about that person, you go back, you don't do

1038
00:43:21.84 --> 00:43:25.08
a little Wikipedia search on the author and so you can they are.

1039
00:43:25.08 --> 00:43:27.88
That gives you like a little insight.

1040
00:43:27.88 --> 00:43:28.88
And that helps me.

1041
00:43:28.88 --> 00:43:29.88
Now I connect with them.

1042
00:43:29.88 --> 00:43:31.44
I know that they're from New Jersey.

1043
00:43:31.44 --> 00:43:34.08
I know that they went to this college.

1044
00:43:34.08 --> 00:43:35.48
I know that they played soccer.

1045
00:43:35.48 --> 00:43:38.44
So now what I'm reading about them and going, oh yeah, that must, oh, you know.

1046
00:43:38.44 --> 00:43:41.000
So I try and get a little background on that person.

1047
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
It gives me a little bit more engagement.

1048
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.84
That's my reading habits.

1049
00:43:45.84 --> 00:43:46.84
That's my reading habits.

1050
00:43:46.84 --> 00:43:49.20
It's kind of advanced.

1051
00:43:49.20 --> 00:43:50.20
And it makes more sense.

1052
00:43:50.20 --> 00:43:54.28
I think that like how you say you want to put yourself in the guy's head, you know.

1053
00:43:54.28 --> 00:43:57.84
Actively I'm going to consciously put myself in the guy's head.

1054
00:43:57.84 --> 00:44:01.68
Sometimes people are so good at writing where that just happens naturally.

1055
00:44:01.68 --> 00:44:06.12
But when you do that, it's like you can kind of get, you get the story, of course.

1056
00:44:06.12 --> 00:44:11.52
But most of the time when you do it all the time, it's lessens learned.

1057
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:12.52
Like what do you learn?

1058
00:44:12.52 --> 00:44:17.56
Almost like when your head is in it, like that, all the lessons are just flying into

1059
00:44:17.56 --> 00:44:18.56
your brain.

1060
00:44:18.56 --> 00:44:24.28
Because it's almost like you're doing like you're going through that war or that particular

1061
00:44:24.28 --> 00:44:25.64
ambush or something like that.

1062
00:44:25.64 --> 00:44:27.72
And then you know, they talk about the mistakes and all that.

1063
00:44:27.72 --> 00:44:29.44
But you feel the mistake.

1064
00:44:29.44 --> 00:44:30.44
Yeah.

1065
00:44:30.44 --> 00:44:35.56
And also I have some experience with what they're talking about.

1066
00:44:35.56 --> 00:44:37.56
Oh yeah, it's like a hell of a...

1067
00:44:37.56 --> 00:44:42.12
And I'm not saying, I'm telling you right now, I don't have even close to the experience.

1068
00:44:42.12 --> 00:44:47.72
Of the books that I'm reading on this podcast, these guys that were in the Battle of Ewo G.

1069
00:44:47.72 --> 00:44:49.72
Man, the Battle of the Bulge.

1070
00:44:49.72 --> 00:44:52.88
No, nothing I did compared to anything that they do.

1071
00:44:52.88 --> 00:44:56.68
But do I know what it's like to be waiting to go into a bad situation?

1072
00:44:56.68 --> 00:44:58.20
Do I know what it's like to be shot at?

1073
00:44:58.20 --> 00:45:01.48
Do I know what it's like to have guys get wounded?

1074
00:45:01.48 --> 00:45:03.28
Yeah, I know what that's like.

1075
00:45:03.28 --> 00:45:06.08
So that's a little connection too.

1076
00:45:06.08 --> 00:45:10.44
But I think, you know, everybody that's been in stressful situations of any kind.

1077
00:45:10.44 --> 00:45:12.92
You can say, oh, what must that feel like?

1078
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:18.60
Hey, I know what it's like when I was waiting to go in for a job interview and I was completely stressed out.

1079
00:45:18.60 --> 00:45:20.40
And that's what this guy must be feeling right here.

1080
00:45:20.40 --> 00:45:21.40
Only even worse.

1081
00:45:21.40 --> 00:45:24.000
So then you make that little mental connection, little mental leap.

1082
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.36
And you can look like you said you can then learn more from it.

1083
00:45:27.36 --> 00:45:28.36
Yeah.

1084
00:45:28.36 --> 00:45:29.36
Which is important.

1085
00:45:29.36 --> 00:45:34.68
Yeah, so if I'm going into this particular situation in a book, I'm reading it.

1086
00:45:34.68 --> 00:45:37.20
And I'm not as engages, maybe I could be.

1087
00:45:37.20 --> 00:45:39.56
This guy goes through XYZ experience.

1088
00:45:39.56 --> 00:45:43.92
I'm looking at it from my opinion, like, well, I can handle that kind of thing.

1089
00:45:43.92 --> 00:45:47.64
But this guy is a type of guy who that's maybe part of his weakness or something like that.

1090
00:45:47.64 --> 00:45:52.28
And vice versa, where, you know, like, I don't know something about claustrophobia.

1091
00:45:52.28 --> 00:45:53.48
I might be like, dang.

1092
00:45:53.48 --> 00:45:59.12
But that claustrophobia part of it, part of the story isn't necessarily a huge part of

1093
00:45:59.12 --> 00:46:01.56
the lesson that you're trying to get from it.

1094
00:46:01.56 --> 00:46:05.36
So you might miss, there might be some disconnects there if you don't.

1095
00:46:05.36 --> 00:46:07.04
Because they have a certain intention.

1096
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:08.92
And you have a certain intention.

1097
00:46:08.92 --> 00:46:13.16
So if you're the lesson lessons learned, you might miss some of those lessons.

1098
00:46:13.16 --> 00:46:15.16
Just the feeling for sure.

1099
00:46:15.16 --> 00:46:16.44
Missing for sure.

1100
00:46:16.44 --> 00:46:17.84
I'm not going to get everything out of a book.

1101
00:46:17.84 --> 00:46:23.16
That's why when you, that's why when you get a really good book, you read it multiple times.

1102
00:46:23.16 --> 00:46:25.48
And you get more out of it every single time that you read it.

1103
00:46:25.48 --> 00:46:26.92
No doubt about that one.

1104
00:46:26.92 --> 00:46:29.92
Yes, true.

1105
00:46:29.92 --> 00:46:32.92
Next question.

1106
00:46:32.92 --> 00:46:38.28
Is it okay if extreme ownership sometimes feels inauthentic?

1107
00:46:38.28 --> 00:46:42.84
For example, taking ownership of something not really your responsibility.

1108
00:46:42.84 --> 00:46:46.84
When does extreme ownership become excessive self-belaming?

1109
00:46:46.84 --> 00:46:50.68
Okay, so again, this was two questions.

1110
00:46:50.68 --> 00:46:55.24
There was multiple questions like this on the interwebs.

1111
00:46:55.24 --> 00:47:03.12
If extreme ownership feels inauthentic or if you're taking ownership of something that's

1112
00:47:03.12 --> 00:47:04.44
not really your responsibility.

1113
00:47:04.44 --> 00:47:08.24
So yes, there is a chance that you're going

1114
00:47:08.24 --> 00:47:09.68
too far.

1115
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:15.84
However, the chances are is that there really is something that you can do about it.

1116
00:47:15.84 --> 00:47:21.32
And too often people say, we know it's just something I couldn't control.

1117
00:47:21.32 --> 00:47:24.80
For example, there's things that you have zero control over.

1118
00:47:24.80 --> 00:47:31.52
You can easily just say, hey, that I couldn't control that and therefore I can't take

1119
00:47:31.52 --> 00:47:38.08
ownership of it, for like for instance, if we were planning an operation and the weather

1120
00:47:38.08 --> 00:47:39.08
went bad.

1121
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:42.68
And so now our vehicles got stuck.

1122
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:45.04
So we could say, hey, you know, weather got bad.

1123
00:47:45.04 --> 00:47:47.24
There's nothing I could do about it.

1124
00:47:47.24 --> 00:47:49.84
And that's people say, well, yeah, you can't control the weather.

1125
00:47:49.84 --> 00:47:51.64
No human being can control the weather.

1126
00:47:51.64 --> 00:47:52.64
Well guess what?

1127
00:47:52.64 --> 00:47:54.60
You could make that excuse and be okay with it.

1128
00:47:54.60 --> 00:47:55.96
Guess what else you could do?

1129
00:47:55.96 --> 00:48:00.96
Hey, I didn't have a good contingency plan for bad weather for rain.

1130
00:48:00.96 --> 00:48:02.88
We should have brought toe ropes with us.

1131
00:48:02.88 --> 00:48:05.64
We should have brought a winch with us so we could get out.

1132
00:48:05.64 --> 00:48:07.000
That's what I should have done.

1133
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I should have done.

1134
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.32
So yes, even though it's really easy and it's like a 90% to just say, hey, it was bad

1135
00:48:12.32 --> 00:48:14.24
weather and nothing I could do about it.

1136
00:48:14.24 --> 00:48:16.24
You could do something about it.

1137
00:48:16.24 --> 00:48:22.000
And that's when when you start making those excuses, they're going to hurt you.

1138
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.40
Same thing in the business world, right?

1139
00:48:23.40 --> 00:48:25.000
Oh, you know, the market.

1140
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.84
I can't control the market, right?

1141
00:48:26.84 --> 00:48:27.84
The market went down.

1142
00:48:27.84 --> 00:48:29.64
We weren't expecting it to go down.

1143
00:48:29.64 --> 00:48:33.84
And now, you know, there's nothing we could do about it wasn't my fault.

1144
00:48:33.84 --> 00:48:41.28
Really, because what you could have done was diversify your income streams, right?

1145
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:42.60
You could have diversified your income streams.

1146
00:48:42.60 --> 00:48:47.44
So you weren't right 100% on this one segment of the market and now you're suffering.

1147
00:48:47.44 --> 00:48:49.56
But all you do is say, well, you know, not my fault.

1148
00:48:49.56 --> 00:48:51.60
You know, we can't control the market that market went down.

1149
00:48:51.60 --> 00:48:54.12
Well, actually you can control your position.

1150
00:48:54.12 --> 00:48:56.96
You control how you were set up strategically.

1151
00:48:56.96 --> 00:48:57.96
You didn't do that.

1152
00:48:57.96 --> 00:49:05.96
So when you do those things, it's generally there is something you could have done about it.

1153
00:49:05.96 --> 00:49:08.28
There's generally something you could have done about it.

1154
00:49:08.28 --> 00:49:16.24
And so if it feels authentic, sure question yourself, but then say, okay, what could

1155
00:49:16.24 --> 00:49:17.76
I have done about this?

1156
00:49:17.76 --> 00:49:23.44
And I would say this, even when you're with your troops and you say, look, I didn't

1157
00:49:23.44 --> 00:49:25.12
have full control of the market.

1158
00:49:25.12 --> 00:49:28.70
I should have done this a little bit better. We should have planned to diversify our income

1159
00:49:28.70 --> 00:49:29.70
streams better.

1160
00:49:29.70 --> 00:49:31.06
I didn't do that.

1161
00:49:31.06 --> 00:49:32.06
Here's where we're out.

1162
00:49:32.06 --> 00:49:33.06
Here's where we're going to move forward.

1163
00:49:33.06 --> 00:49:38.74
The guys aren't going to say, like, hang you out to dry because you took ownership of

1164
00:49:38.74 --> 00:49:39.74
that thing.

1165
00:49:39.74 --> 00:49:41.98
They're going to realize, look, a job is taking ownership of that.

1166
00:49:41.98 --> 00:49:42.98
That's cool.

1167
00:49:42.98 --> 00:49:47.88
We did get shafted by the market and, oh, well, less and learned we're going to move

1168
00:49:47.88 --> 00:49:48.88
forward.

1169
00:49:48.88 --> 00:49:52.88
But when you just come in and say, hey, market went down, not my fault.

1170
00:49:52.88 --> 00:49:54.80
You lose respect to your guys.

1171
00:49:54.80 --> 00:49:56.000
So don't do that.

1172
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:04.92
Now, all that being said, is there situations where or are there situations where extreme

1173
00:50:04.92 --> 00:50:10.46
ownership actually does become excessive self-blaming and the answer is yes, because there

1174
00:50:10.46 --> 00:50:14.68
are certain situations where there actually is nothing that you could do.

1175
00:50:14.68 --> 00:50:19.44
So for example, and this is a great example speaking of lessons learned from the book company

1176
00:50:19.44 --> 00:50:28.24
commander that we just went over on the podcast, Captain McDonald, they got assaulted by,

1177
00:50:28.24 --> 00:50:32.32
like basically the entire German army.

1178
00:50:32.32 --> 00:50:40.32
And they were left to try and hold the line with pistols and rifles against tiger tanks,

1179
00:50:40.32 --> 00:50:46.56
right, an 88 millimeter guns and thousands and thousands of troops attacking them.

1180
00:50:46.56 --> 00:50:48.56
He could not have stopped them.

1181
00:50:48.56 --> 00:50:54.44
Like you cannot stop a division of soldiers with a company of soldiers.

1182
00:50:54.44 --> 00:50:55.76
You can't do it.

1183
00:50:55.76 --> 00:51:01.64
Especially when they have artillery and they have tanks and you don't have any tank support,

1184
00:51:01.64 --> 00:51:04.72
it's it's an unwinnable situation.

1185
00:51:04.72 --> 00:51:09.52
So for him to continually blame himself and say, I should have planned better.

1186
00:51:09.52 --> 00:51:11.08
Could he say that?

1187
00:51:11.08 --> 00:51:12.24
Sure.

1188
00:51:12.24 --> 00:51:14.80
He did what he did with the information that he knew at the time.

1189
00:51:14.80 --> 00:51:17.48
If he would have known it was a division attack, they would have set up differently.

1190
00:51:17.48 --> 00:51:21.72
He thought he was just setting up a typical defensive perimeter.

1191
00:51:21.72 --> 00:51:26.52
So can you get to a point where you're blaming yourself excessively?

1192
00:51:26.52 --> 00:51:27.84
Yes, you can.

1193
00:51:27.84 --> 00:51:32.04
And you do need to be somewhat cognizant of that.

1194
00:51:32.04 --> 00:51:36.44
I'm going to tell you those cases are extremely rare, extremely rare.

1195
00:51:36.44 --> 00:51:39.44
Most of the time you have a lot more control over your own destiny than you think you

1196
00:51:39.44 --> 00:51:40.44
do.

1197
00:51:40.44 --> 00:51:44.92
And the worst thing you can do is continually say, you know what?

1198
00:51:44.92 --> 00:51:47.36
This is one of those rare instances where I had no control.

1199
00:51:47.36 --> 00:51:51.72
It's probably not, probably an instance where you did have control.

1200
00:51:51.72 --> 00:51:58.40
So keep it in the back of your mind, but keep in the front of your mind ownership.

1201
00:51:58.40 --> 00:52:02.08
It seems like excessive self-blaming.

1202
00:52:02.08 --> 00:52:07.56
That sounds like, you know, maybe someone who's fully blaming themselves and then like,

1203
00:52:07.56 --> 00:52:11.96
instead of taking action to, you know, implement corrective measures, something like

1204
00:52:11.96 --> 00:52:15.88
this they're like, I suck and maybe they go into a depression or something like this.

1205
00:52:15.88 --> 00:52:17.28
Or yeah, whether you're in the China.

1206
00:52:17.28 --> 00:52:18.28
Yeah, what you're getting.

1207
00:52:18.28 --> 00:52:19.28
Yeah, absolutely.

1208
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:20.28
They dwell on it.

1209
00:52:20.28 --> 00:52:21.28
Yeah.

1210
00:52:21.28 --> 00:52:22.28
They dwell on the mistake.

1211
00:52:22.28 --> 00:52:24.08
They dwell on the fact that things didn't go their way.

1212
00:52:24.08 --> 00:52:25.96
They dwell on the fact that it's their fault.

1213
00:52:25.96 --> 00:52:28.56
And now they're like you said, gunshot, that's great.

1214
00:52:28.56 --> 00:52:29.56
Indecisive.

1215
00:52:29.56 --> 00:52:30.56
Yeah.

1216
00:52:30.56 --> 00:52:31.56
People get indecisive.

1217
00:52:31.56 --> 00:52:33.28
So no, yeah, those are great points.

1218
00:52:33.28 --> 00:52:38.36
You definitely don't want to do that excessive ownership where it gets to a point where it

1219
00:52:38.36 --> 00:52:43.000
turns you into an indecisive person that's not going to make decisions because you're

1220
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
a scared you're going to fail.

1221
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
You don't trust yourself anymore.

1222
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.96
Yeah, that's a great point.

1223
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:48.12
That is excessive.

1224
00:52:48.12 --> 00:52:50.16
What you need to do is say, okay, this was the problem.

1225
00:52:50.16 --> 00:52:51.16
This was my fault.

1226
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:52.16
Here's what I'm going to do to fix it.

1227
00:52:52.16 --> 00:52:53.16
I'm going to move on.

1228
00:52:53.16 --> 00:52:55.36
We can't do all on the stuff that happened in the past.

1229
00:52:55.36 --> 00:52:56.36
Can't do it.

1230
00:52:56.36 --> 00:52:57.36
Good point.

1231
00:52:57.36 --> 00:53:05.16
That how you know how early, how you kind of started this where if you, if you, let's

1232
00:53:05.16 --> 00:53:06.16
say, okay, the opposite.

1233
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:07.16
Let's say you're a believer.

1234
00:53:07.16 --> 00:53:08.16
Right.

1235
00:53:08.16 --> 00:53:09.16
You're like, something goes wrong.

1236
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:10.66
You blame someone.

1237
00:53:10.66 --> 00:53:15.96
If someone's blaming me for something, for everything, you know, all the time.

1238
00:53:15.96 --> 00:53:18.68
Of course, you know, the defense comes up and all this stuff that always happens.

1239
00:53:18.68 --> 00:53:22.28
But after a while, they build that rep as being a blamer.

1240
00:53:22.28 --> 00:53:27.40
You know, so now just, it starts to become automatic that your defensive against this guy.

1241
00:53:27.40 --> 00:53:29.16
You don't trust them all this stuff.

1242
00:53:29.16 --> 00:53:30.76
But the same kind of goes opposite.

1243
00:53:30.76 --> 00:53:35.72
You know how like, you know, if someone's always taking responsibility for the whole deal,

1244
00:53:35.72 --> 00:53:37.12
they're not blaming you at all.

1245
00:53:37.12 --> 00:53:38.12
They're like, no, it's my fault.

1246
00:53:38.12 --> 00:53:39.12
No, it's my fault.

1247
00:53:39.12 --> 00:53:40.12
They're correcting it.

1248
00:53:40.12 --> 00:53:43.92
They're, you almost, you have a bunch of stories like this where guys are like, no, it's

1249
00:53:43.92 --> 00:53:44.92
my fault.

1250
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:48.60
And they all want to jump in, you know, and so the point there is like, after a while,

1251
00:53:48.60 --> 00:53:51.40
you build that rep where it's automatic.

1252
00:53:51.40 --> 00:53:54.56
People will automatically not have any kind of defense or whatever.

1253
00:53:54.56 --> 00:53:56.44
They're automatically want to solve problems.

1254
00:53:56.44 --> 00:53:57.44
Yeah.

1255
00:53:57.44 --> 00:53:58.44
That's true, too.

1256
00:53:58.44 --> 00:54:01.04
That rep, and building trust is how you put it.

1257
00:54:01.04 --> 00:54:02.60
It is building trust.

1258
00:54:02.60 --> 00:54:03.60
It is indeed.

1259
00:54:03.60 --> 00:54:04.60
Interesting.

1260
00:54:04.60 --> 00:54:07.000
Next question.

1261
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.28
What made you choose literature for your degree?

1262
00:54:12.28 --> 00:54:16.60
You know, again, I think I've answered this before, probably a few times.

1263
00:54:16.60 --> 00:54:21.76
So I'll keep it brief, but people, a bunch of people did ask along those lines, along

1264
00:54:21.76 --> 00:54:24.52
a question along those lines.

1265
00:54:24.52 --> 00:54:30.16
The reason I wanted to become better at English and the reason I studied English in

1266
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:38.40
college is because I had seen the importance of language in the military.

1267
00:54:38.40 --> 00:54:39.56
Written and spoken.

1268
00:54:39.56 --> 00:54:44.92
So written, you're doing evaluations, you're writing and reading and receiving orders,

1269
00:54:44.92 --> 00:54:51.64
you're writing and receiving rules of engagement, concept of operations, awards, field

1270
00:54:51.64 --> 00:54:52.64
manual.

1271
00:54:52.64 --> 00:54:58.68
All these things that you do in the military are written either you're writing them or

1272
00:54:58.68 --> 00:54:59.68
you're reading them.

1273
00:54:59.68 --> 00:55:03.56
So to be able to write well and to be able to read and understand well is very important.

1274
00:55:03.56 --> 00:55:09.04
On top of that, the spoken word, you're doing briefings, you're giving up orders,

1275
00:55:09.04 --> 00:55:13.92
you're doing interviews or you're getting interviewed, you're doing, even doing like interrogations.

1276
00:55:13.92 --> 00:55:16.96
All these things are spoken word.

1277
00:55:16.96 --> 00:55:23.40
So the better command you have of the English language, the better going to be at those

1278
00:55:23.40 --> 00:55:32.64
and furthermore in that book that we read the Armed Forces Officer, 1955 edition, I think

1279
00:55:32.64 --> 00:55:33.96
it is.

1280
00:55:33.96 --> 00:55:39.60
I don't have the code on me, but leadership is communicating.

1281
00:55:39.60 --> 00:55:40.84
That's what it is.

1282
00:55:40.84 --> 00:55:43.36
It's communicating with other people.

1283
00:55:43.36 --> 00:55:45.20
What the idea is, what the goal is.

1284
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:48.76
So communication is the use of words.

1285
00:55:48.76 --> 00:55:54.92
So the better you can use words, the better job you're going to do as a leader.

1286
00:55:54.92 --> 00:55:59.36
And that's what I realized when I was had the opportunity to go to college and got

1287
00:55:59.36 --> 00:56:00.36
to pick my degree.

1288
00:56:00.36 --> 00:56:02.08
That's why I picked it.

1289
00:56:02.08 --> 00:56:03.08
Pretty simple.

1290
00:56:03.08 --> 00:56:09.48
They get also it seems like when somebody's your boss or your leader in whatever the

1291
00:56:09.48 --> 00:56:16.04
capacity, someone misuses a word or they'll say the word, they'll say irregardless.

1292
00:56:16.04 --> 00:56:18.52
You don't want it, you totally said that wrong.

1293
00:56:18.52 --> 00:56:21.36
After all, you kind of like, just that feeling like it.

1294
00:56:21.36 --> 00:56:23.16
Disrespect this person.

1295
00:56:23.16 --> 00:56:26.44
Well, like, he goes out of Facebook or Ant.

1296
00:56:26.44 --> 00:56:29.76
Even if he's not your boss, he's on a Facebook or whatever, clear.

1297
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:37.32
Because on this rant, but then he's like misusing your or failing to put a period.

1298
00:56:37.32 --> 00:56:42.12
It's almost like you have that feeling, like you can't take them seriously.

1299
00:56:42.12 --> 00:56:43.12
You want them to take you.

1300
00:56:43.12 --> 00:56:44.12
We're just important.

1301
00:56:44.12 --> 00:56:45.12
Yeah.

1302
00:56:45.12 --> 00:56:46.12
It is definitely important.

1303
00:56:46.12 --> 00:56:49.56
Not because technically, how much bearing does that really have?

1304
00:56:49.56 --> 00:56:50.56
It does the idea of something.

1305
00:56:50.56 --> 00:56:51.56
But it just seems that way.

1306
00:56:51.56 --> 00:56:52.56
At the same time, it does.

1307
00:56:52.56 --> 00:56:55.60
And I'll tell you, one thing, I'm not a good speller.

1308
00:56:55.60 --> 00:56:59.24
If it wasn't for spell check, I'd spell all kinds of stuff wrong.

1309
00:56:59.24 --> 00:57:03.08
I never studied spelling because when I was a kid, I wasn't, because that's when you

1310
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:04.08
learn to spell.

1311
00:57:04.08 --> 00:57:07.000
I think when you're a kid, I didn't pay much attention to spelling.

1312
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
I never have.

1313
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.32
So just the fact that you care, though, that's like the major part of it.

1314
00:57:12.32 --> 00:57:14.48
You know, you're like, okay, there's spell check.

1315
00:57:14.48 --> 00:57:15.48
Yeah.

1316
00:57:15.48 --> 00:57:18.96
And one thing that's cool is, by the way, you don't need to major in English to get good

1317
00:57:18.96 --> 00:57:20.76
at writing a good, good at communicating.

1318
00:57:20.76 --> 00:57:26.88
You can major in anything as long as you be nice to take a couple courses, though.

1319
00:57:26.88 --> 00:57:31.04
And when you do start diving in, and I'll tell you Shakespeare is a big one.

1320
00:57:31.04 --> 00:57:36.44
When you start diving into understanding Shakespeare for real, you really learn how to read.

1321
00:57:36.44 --> 00:57:39.64
Well, you really learn how to read well.

1322
00:57:39.64 --> 00:57:49.52
And when you submit papers that are being graded by somebody that is a master with grammar

1323
00:57:49.52 --> 00:57:52.20
and they're picking you apart, you learn how to write better.

1324
00:57:52.20 --> 00:57:53.76
There's no doubt about it.

1325
00:57:53.76 --> 00:58:01.32
And so that's why I enjoyed both those aspects, both reading and truly understanding

1326
00:58:01.32 --> 00:58:07.36
stuff and writing and being graded in such a way that someone saying, hey, you didn't

1327
00:58:07.36 --> 00:58:08.96
need to use this word.

1328
00:58:08.96 --> 00:58:10.88
You could have shortened this sentence.

1329
00:58:10.88 --> 00:58:16.20
And basically, everyone's goal is to make things cleaner and shorter most of the time.

1330
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:23.96
Pretty though, is to me the most important factor. I want to make sure that what I'm saying

1331
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:26.84
is very clear.

1332
00:58:26.84 --> 00:58:32.52
So, yeah, English, I took a class called Advanced Grammar and Syntax.

1333
00:58:32.52 --> 00:58:33.52
Dig it.

1334
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:38.52
And I just, I would have taken multiple classes if they had the only one.

1335
00:58:38.52 --> 00:58:39.52
That's all you.

1336
00:58:39.52 --> 00:58:40.52
Yeah.

1337
00:58:40.52 --> 00:58:41.52
Yeah.

1338
00:58:41.52 --> 00:58:46.16
That was one of the best things I did was when, because my guys had to write evaluations,

1339
00:58:46.16 --> 00:58:50.52
the guys, my subordinate leadership would have to write evaluations when I was at the,

1340
00:58:50.52 --> 00:58:54.44
it happens my whole career, but what once I became an officer.

1341
00:58:54.44 --> 00:59:00.92
But when I was at the training command, I had a hundred guys or so, probably more than that.

1342
00:59:00.92 --> 00:59:03.000
But everyone had to have an evaluation written.

1343
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.16
And so it was the senior guys, the senior, my subordinate leadership, my direct subordinate

1344
00:59:07.16 --> 00:59:10.44
leadership would write their evaluations.

1345
00:59:10.44 --> 00:59:15.64
And so, if you didn't police these guys up and they'd get go, there were v issues.

1346
00:59:15.64 --> 00:59:22.16
So, I brought them in and I said, hey, bring me your best evaluation of your best guy.

1347
00:59:22.16 --> 00:59:26.20
And so they brought them in, we put them up on the screen and I murdered them all.

1348
00:59:26.20 --> 00:59:30.76
And it was so good because they all got so much out of it.

1349
00:59:30.76 --> 00:59:34.96
You probably need to go through that drill like one time, maybe two times, of someone

1350
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:36.52
murdering your writing.

1351
00:59:36.52 --> 00:59:39.24
Because all you do is you start off, you just read their sentence to them.

1352
00:59:39.24 --> 00:59:42.72
And it's all you do, you start off, you just read their sentence.

1353
00:59:42.72 --> 00:59:44.44
Just what they have written, you just read it.

1354
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:46.68
And they go, and you say, is that what you're trying to say?

1355
00:59:46.68 --> 00:59:47.68
They don't know.

1356
00:59:47.68 --> 00:59:50.36
I just stop, stop, you know, I'll go back.

1357
00:59:50.36 --> 00:59:53.20
Because a lot of times when you read something allowed to yourself, you recognize how

1358
00:59:53.20 --> 00:59:55.32
jacked up, you wrote it.

1359
00:59:55.32 --> 00:59:59.92
So that's like less than number one in writing with more clarity.

1360
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:03.28
Just read your sentences and see what they sound like.

1361
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:06.04
So you can't really read your own note, right?

1362
01:00:06.04 --> 01:00:08.44
Because when you read your own, you know exactly what you were saying.

1363
01:00:08.44 --> 01:00:11.92
You can read your own.

1364
01:00:11.92 --> 01:00:14.24
But and that will be helpful.

1365
01:00:14.24 --> 01:00:17.28
But yes, sometimes you'll already have an idea in your head, so you won't get the full

1366
01:00:17.28 --> 01:00:20.28
benefit of having someone else read it allowed to you.

1367
01:00:20.28 --> 01:00:21.28
Relax.

1368
01:00:21.28 --> 01:00:22.96
It's true.

1369
01:00:22.96 --> 01:00:25.84
So yeah, English is definitely important.

1370
01:00:25.84 --> 01:00:32.80
And in his fun too, I enjoy one of the odd things like for Twitter.

1371
01:00:32.80 --> 01:00:36.24
I have fun feeding something into 140 characters.

1372
01:00:36.24 --> 01:00:37.60
Like that's enjoyable to be.

1373
01:00:37.60 --> 01:00:39.08
I know that's like a twisted thing.

1374
01:00:39.08 --> 01:00:40.24
It's only a little puzzle.

1375
01:00:40.24 --> 01:00:41.24
Yeah, it's a little puzzle.

1376
01:00:41.24 --> 01:00:44.72
Or could I use them maybe I could look at the, get it in there.

1377
01:00:44.72 --> 01:00:45.80
That's kind of fun for me.

1378
01:00:45.80 --> 01:00:50.000
I thought something, I thought you had that kind of fun in some of the English classes

1379
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.52
that I took where I was trying to just get the perfect words.

1380
01:00:52.52 --> 01:00:53.68
And so there's a little puzzle too.

1381
01:00:53.68 --> 01:00:54.68
It's a lot of fun.

1382
01:00:54.68 --> 01:00:55.68
It can be fun.

1383
01:00:55.68 --> 01:00:58.16
If you have that type of personality.

1384
01:00:58.16 --> 01:00:59.16
Yeah.

1385
01:00:59.16 --> 01:01:02.52
Interestingly, you're not I don't find you to be a grammar Nazi.

1386
01:01:02.52 --> 01:01:08.88
No, I wouldn't say I'm a grammar Nazi much.

1387
01:01:08.88 --> 01:01:13.64
Because I just don't think I'm an over grammar Nazi.

1388
01:01:13.64 --> 01:01:16.52
I think I think I find it.

1389
01:01:16.52 --> 01:01:19.80
I think I kind of just say, oh yeah, that's poorly written.

1390
01:01:19.80 --> 01:01:21.84
Yeah, to yourself, can I call myself?

1391
01:01:21.84 --> 01:01:25.88
I mean, unless it's someone that is going to turn something in and I just have to say,

1392
01:01:25.88 --> 01:01:27.28
hey man, it's not good.

1393
01:01:27.28 --> 01:01:29.64
Which technically that's not being a grammar Nazi.

1394
01:01:29.64 --> 01:01:33.32
Grammar Nazis like me and you are telling you about, you know, you get through something

1395
01:01:33.32 --> 01:01:37.88
or beat the beach and you're like, you know, I correct you.

1396
01:01:37.88 --> 01:01:40.04
I don't, yeah, I don't do that a lot.

1397
01:01:40.04 --> 01:01:42.12
Because you know why?

1398
01:01:42.12 --> 01:01:45.20
Partially, not a lazy, not cool.

1399
01:01:45.20 --> 01:01:47.32
But it's a conversation, right?

1400
01:01:47.32 --> 01:01:48.32
Yeah.

1401
01:01:48.32 --> 01:01:53.12
And I was going to say something about like being from the streets, which is a major exaggeration

1402
01:01:53.12 --> 01:01:54.28
because I'm not from the streets.

1403
01:01:54.28 --> 01:01:56.80
Although I spent some time in the streets.

1404
01:01:56.80 --> 01:02:02.44
But, you know, I enjoy language, right?

1405
01:02:02.44 --> 01:02:03.80
I enjoy language.

1406
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:08.08
And so when somebody speaks improperly, I actually like it.

1407
01:02:08.08 --> 01:02:10.12
It's a different, it's a different thing.

1408
01:02:10.12 --> 01:02:14.72
I mean, even Corn Mac McCarthy, probably my favorite writer, he doesn't, he does all kinds

1409
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:15.96
of crazy things.

1410
01:02:15.96 --> 01:02:17.96
He doesn't use a lot of punctuation.

1411
01:02:17.96 --> 01:02:19.80
He doesn't use quotes.

1412
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:21.56
So you're dealing with a whole other ballgame.

1413
01:02:21.56 --> 01:02:23.80
I'm not good slamming him.

1414
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:24.80
Yeah.

1415
01:02:24.80 --> 01:02:29.12
And honestly, it makes it harder, in many cases, it makes it harder to read what he's

1416
01:02:29.12 --> 01:02:30.12
written.

1417
01:02:30.12 --> 01:02:34.24
And people say, well, he says that you should need quotations.

1418
01:02:34.24 --> 01:02:39.52
So I'm not going to say here in a criticized Corn Mac.

1419
01:02:39.52 --> 01:02:40.52
Yeah, I do it.

1420
01:02:40.52 --> 01:02:41.52
Probably that makes so much sense.

1421
01:02:41.52 --> 01:02:42.52
I never thought about that.

1422
01:02:42.52 --> 01:02:47.40
How you how, two things actually, where, yeah, you like it.

1423
01:02:47.40 --> 01:02:50.20
There's these memes and they're so funny.

1424
01:02:50.20 --> 01:02:52.44
Where I'll just have a picture, maybe familiar, maybe not.

1425
01:02:52.44 --> 01:02:55.44
And then I'll have like some little thing on top of it.

1426
01:02:55.44 --> 01:02:56.44
Like, how you know what?

1427
01:02:56.44 --> 01:02:57.44
How you know what?

1428
01:02:57.44 --> 01:02:58.44
And then when you go through your phone, I don't know.

1429
01:02:58.44 --> 01:03:02.12
And a lot of those memes are just no grammar.

1430
01:03:02.12 --> 01:03:04.76
No, it's almost like just an ignorant person wrote it.

1431
01:03:04.76 --> 01:03:06.76
And it makes it way more funny.

1432
01:03:06.76 --> 01:03:11.12
So overall, the point there is like, people talk in pigeon or something like that or

1433
01:03:11.12 --> 01:03:15.96
with a crazy accent, their English not the, it can be more enjoyable experience.

1434
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:17.84
It's a more in-depth experience for sure.

1435
01:03:17.84 --> 01:03:19.60
So there's that.

1436
01:03:19.60 --> 01:03:26.08
And at the same time, there are few, there are certain situations where if you misuse

1437
01:03:26.08 --> 01:03:31.000
a comma or misuse or don't put quotes or something like that, you can literally say something

1438
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.20
different than their, you know, misunderstanding skin kind of creep in.

1439
01:03:34.20 --> 01:03:37.84
Yeah, and people ask me about, I hate to bring this up right now, because this is just like

1440
01:03:37.84 --> 01:03:39.96
a bloodbath argument.

1441
01:03:39.96 --> 01:03:47.36
But the Oxford comma, which you can look at in the interwebs.

1442
01:03:47.36 --> 01:03:52.12
But it's basically when you say a list of things, the last thing that you're going to

1443
01:03:52.12 --> 01:03:58.24
say, which normally you say, and this, the Oxford comma, as you put a comma before that

1444
01:03:58.24 --> 01:03:59.72
and.

1445
01:03:59.72 --> 01:04:02.92
And for me, it makes things very, very clear.

1446
01:04:02.92 --> 01:04:08.80
And the reason some people don't use it, it came from the new, I think it came from

1447
01:04:08.80 --> 01:04:11.76
newspaper where they're trying to, you know, fit stuff in the column and they're going

1448
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:12.76
to fit stuff in the newspaper.

1449
01:04:12.76 --> 01:04:13.88
So they, hey, we can get rid of that comma.

1450
01:04:13.88 --> 01:04:14.88
It's not needed.

1451
01:04:14.88 --> 01:04:16.16
That's kind of where it started.

1452
01:04:16.16 --> 01:04:18.56
But it's not proper.

1453
01:04:18.56 --> 01:04:22.48
And hey, sometimes it makes sense, but a lot of times it doesn't.

1454
01:04:22.48 --> 01:04:23.80
So anyways, that's one small example.

1455
01:04:23.80 --> 01:04:26.16
And the other funny thing, because I was talking about corn mac macarze, I'm going to say

1456
01:04:26.16 --> 01:04:29.12
this little thing too, because it reminded me of it.

1457
01:04:29.12 --> 01:04:36.56
Another thing in the success magazine interview or article, wasn't interviews and article.

1458
01:04:36.56 --> 01:04:42.56
He said the writer, who's a good dude, he said.

1459
01:04:42.56 --> 01:04:49.56
The article rarely does interviews, right?

1460
01:04:49.56 --> 01:04:52.28
And that's when Tim Ferriss said that two years ago, Tim Ferriss was 100% correct, because

1461
01:04:52.28 --> 01:04:54.32
I had done zero interviews.

1462
01:04:54.32 --> 01:04:56.64
So he could have said, and he's never done an interview before.

1463
01:04:56.64 --> 01:04:58.76
Tim Ferriss would have been speaking the truth.

1464
01:04:58.76 --> 01:05:01.20
And he was at the time.

1465
01:05:01.20 --> 01:05:06.68
Since then, I don't know how many freaking interviews I have done.

1466
01:05:06.68 --> 01:05:10.56
I have done an interview upon an interview upon an interview upon an interview.

1467
01:05:10.56 --> 01:05:12.32
It's ridiculous.

1468
01:05:12.32 --> 01:05:21.28
And I put in my little Facebook rubuddle to the argument, or my comments about the or

1469
01:05:21.28 --> 01:05:23.20
corrections to the article.

1470
01:05:23.20 --> 01:05:25.52
I said, I actually do interviews all the time.

1471
01:05:25.52 --> 01:05:29.92
If you want someone that rarely does interviews, that's corn mac macarze.

1472
01:05:29.92 --> 01:05:34.48
Because corn mac macarze, he doesn't do interviews.

1473
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:35.92
He does, he's got what?

1474
01:05:35.92 --> 01:05:40.000
I think he's done one interview in the past 20 years with Oprah Winfrey.

1475
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That's it.

1476
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
20 years.

1477
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.28
One of the most, you know, one of the best writers of our time living today.

1478
01:05:47.28 --> 01:05:49.08
You know, is he going to come on the podcast?

1479
01:05:49.08 --> 01:05:50.08
Nope.

1480
01:05:50.08 --> 01:05:51.08
He's not.

1481
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:53.08
He really comes on podcast.

1482
01:05:53.08 --> 01:05:54.76
He should come on this podcast.

1483
01:05:54.76 --> 01:05:56.76
Even I agree.

1484
01:05:56.76 --> 01:05:57.76
But, yeah.

1485
01:05:57.76 --> 01:06:02.24
Also, if you, if you see a lot of misuse grammar and you let it go and you see a lot

1486
01:06:02.24 --> 01:06:04.52
of it, you get better at understanding it.

1487
01:06:04.52 --> 01:06:08.12
You know, like, you know how certain people they're like, oh, this guy's accent is too

1488
01:06:08.12 --> 01:06:09.12
thick.

1489
01:06:09.12 --> 01:06:10.48
You know, I can't understand them.

1490
01:06:10.48 --> 01:06:13.24
I mean, while the guy next to you is like, oh, I heard that accent before plenty times.

1491
01:06:13.24 --> 01:06:14.24
Right.

1492
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:17.44
You know, my neighbor is Jamaican or whatever.

1493
01:06:17.44 --> 01:06:19.76
So they understand, it's kind of like that idea.

1494
01:06:19.76 --> 01:06:22.48
You know, people misusing words, grammar all messed up.

1495
01:06:22.48 --> 01:06:24.24
But if you used to that, you're like, oh, I see what they're saying.

1496
01:06:24.24 --> 01:06:25.76
He has a lot to do with the context as well.

1497
01:06:25.76 --> 01:06:27.88
But I'm just saying if you're familiar with that situation.

1498
01:06:27.88 --> 01:06:31.48
So it kind of expands your mind to allow people to use bad grammar.

1499
01:06:31.48 --> 01:06:32.48
Yeah.

1500
01:06:32.48 --> 01:06:33.68
That's not to say you should use bad grammar.

1501
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:36.32
I'm just saying from the standpoint of understanding.

1502
01:06:36.32 --> 01:06:40.88
I could see where you're coming from, I'm not sure that I would completely buy into that.

1503
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:42.12
But we'll go with it for this.

1504
01:06:42.12 --> 01:06:43.12
Can't stand on time.

1505
01:06:43.12 --> 01:06:44.12
I'll go with it.

1506
01:06:44.12 --> 01:06:45.72
Well, you're right.

1507
01:06:45.72 --> 01:06:47.96
In the fact that some people can understand accents really well.

1508
01:06:47.96 --> 01:06:48.96
Yeah.

1509
01:06:48.96 --> 01:06:50.28
And for me, it depends on the accent.

1510
01:06:50.28 --> 01:06:52.68
Some accents I can understand find, some accents I can't.

1511
01:06:52.68 --> 01:06:54.96
Yeah, it has to do with what you're familiar with.

1512
01:06:54.96 --> 01:06:55.96
Yes.

1513
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:58.72
Yes, you are correct.

1514
01:06:58.72 --> 01:07:00.72
Next question.

1515
01:07:00.72 --> 01:07:02.36
Juckle.

1516
01:07:02.36 --> 01:07:06.28
What do you think about mechanical warrior robots in the seal teams?

1517
01:07:06.28 --> 01:07:17.32
Again, this is a question where people ask me this because there's weird hype and what's

1518
01:07:17.32 --> 01:07:20.000
the word conspiracy.

1519
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.84
Type attitude about artificial intelligence and robots and all that.

1520
01:07:26.84 --> 01:07:29.40
And so my thoughts are robots.

1521
01:07:29.40 --> 01:07:31.20
Like warfiting robots.

1522
01:07:31.20 --> 01:07:32.20
Awesome.

1523
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:37.80
This build the most awesome destruction robots.

1524
01:07:37.80 --> 01:07:39.96
And let's build an army of them.

1525
01:07:39.96 --> 01:07:41.96
And let's let them get after it.

1526
01:07:41.96 --> 01:07:42.96
I think it's awesome.

1527
01:07:42.96 --> 01:07:48.000
You look at what's happening right now with drones and unmanned air vehicles.

1528
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That's where we're going.

1529
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.80
In another, I forget the name.

1530
01:07:50.80 --> 01:07:52.64
I mean, I forget the specific timeframe.

1531
01:07:52.64 --> 01:07:59.84
But in 10, 20, 30 years, there's not going to be any more manned fighter jets, military

1532
01:07:59.84 --> 01:08:00.84
fighter jets.

1533
01:08:00.84 --> 01:08:01.84
Why would you do that?

1534
01:08:01.84 --> 01:08:05.04
You could put a computer in there and you can fly it from the ground or you can either

1535
01:08:05.04 --> 01:08:06.04
need to fly it.

1536
01:08:06.04 --> 01:08:08.04
It'll do with your mission that you want it to do.

1537
01:08:08.04 --> 01:08:15.20
So when we can come up with a robot that a terminator robot that can go and attack and

1538
01:08:15.20 --> 01:08:18.16
take care of the problem, yeah, let's do that.

1539
01:08:18.16 --> 01:08:19.48
I support it.

1540
01:08:19.48 --> 01:08:23.72
I hit the whole idea that robots will turn against us.

1541
01:08:23.72 --> 01:08:25.60
Will build better robots that will kill those robots.

1542
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:26.60
I'm not worried about that.

1543
01:08:26.60 --> 01:08:27.60
Or if I robots.

1544
01:08:27.60 --> 01:08:28.60
Yeah, I don't care.

1545
01:08:28.60 --> 01:08:30.60
I say, bring it on, bring on the robots.

1546
01:08:30.60 --> 01:08:31.60
Yeah.

1547
01:08:31.60 --> 01:08:32.60
I'm sure.

1548
01:08:32.60 --> 01:08:33.60
Yes, too.

1549
01:08:33.60 --> 01:08:34.60
I know.

1550
01:08:34.60 --> 01:08:36.60
Like Joe Rogan, you'd be freaking out about some robots.

1551
01:08:36.60 --> 01:08:43.04
And I think, you know, pretty much everybody, I'm probably the ignorant person here, right?

1552
01:08:43.04 --> 01:08:48.84
Because the smart people, like Elon Musk in Sam Harris, they're all, you know, you

1553
01:08:48.84 --> 01:08:52.20
got to watch out because this artificial intelligence is going to become smarter than us.

1554
01:08:52.20 --> 01:08:53.20
And then what are we going to do?

1555
01:08:53.20 --> 01:08:54.60
It's going to attack us and control us.

1556
01:08:54.60 --> 01:08:59.68
Yeah, their thing is if it lines up that they ultimately figure out and they won't be

1557
01:08:59.68 --> 01:09:00.68
wrong.

1558
01:09:00.68 --> 01:09:01.68
That's the view.

1559
01:09:01.68 --> 01:09:08.16
If they figure out that they don't need us, then the logical thing would be to eliminate

1560
01:09:08.16 --> 01:09:09.16
us.

1561
01:09:09.16 --> 01:09:11.56
Like everybody and everything does ever.

1562
01:09:11.56 --> 01:09:12.56
You know?

1563
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:13.56
Yeah.

1564
01:09:13.56 --> 01:09:15.24
I got to admit, like that sounds pretty cool.

1565
01:09:15.24 --> 01:09:16.56
I say bring it.

1566
01:09:16.56 --> 01:09:17.96
I want that robot war.

1567
01:09:17.96 --> 01:09:18.96
Let's get it on.

1568
01:09:18.96 --> 01:09:21.96
Well, typically robots, I mean, we say unmanned.

1569
01:09:21.96 --> 01:09:23.36
I have a question for you.

1570
01:09:23.36 --> 01:09:25.92
How about we unplug them, right?

1571
01:09:25.92 --> 01:09:27.36
Cut their power source.

1572
01:09:27.36 --> 01:09:28.36
Yeah.

1573
01:09:28.36 --> 01:09:36.60
Typically, I mean, even that, I don't think it, I think that's a simple thing for a robot

1574
01:09:36.60 --> 01:09:40.84
if they're smart to understand, oh, they might very well cut our power source.

1575
01:09:40.84 --> 01:09:42.32
So they're going to figure that out pretty quick.

1576
01:09:42.32 --> 01:09:43.80
I would imagine if they're turning.

1577
01:09:43.80 --> 01:09:47.16
But I like the way Sam Harris described artificial intelligence one time, though.

1578
01:09:47.16 --> 01:09:53.36
He said, imagine that you, that I ask you a question.

1579
01:09:53.36 --> 01:09:59.20
And then you have a year to go and research and come up with the perfect answer and then

1580
01:09:59.20 --> 01:10:02.20
you come back and you answer that question, but it happens in a millisecond.

1581
01:10:02.20 --> 01:10:04.60
That's what a computer's going to be able to do.

1582
01:10:04.60 --> 01:10:05.60
Yeah.

1583
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:06.88
And that's pretty awesome.

1584
01:10:06.88 --> 01:10:10.88
And do they end up then, and I don't, you know, I'm not a, I don't even know what you

1585
01:10:10.88 --> 01:10:13.44
call a person that theorizes about this kind of thing.

1586
01:10:13.44 --> 01:10:15.36
I'm not one of them.

1587
01:10:15.36 --> 01:10:18.60
But that's pretty unbelievable.

1588
01:10:18.60 --> 01:10:22.24
And it'll only get faster and better from there.

1589
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:27.28
I just think that I don't think it's too hard to control it to put controls in there

1590
01:10:27.28 --> 01:10:31.08
that prevent the turning of the robots.

1591
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:32.80
Like preventative mechanisms.

1592
01:10:32.80 --> 01:10:33.80
Yeah.

1593
01:10:33.80 --> 01:10:36.56
Well, you talk about unmanned stuff.

1594
01:10:36.56 --> 01:10:39.84
And you know what I'm about to make a movie reference.

1595
01:10:39.84 --> 01:10:40.84
It is.

1596
01:10:40.84 --> 01:10:41.84
Robo cop.

1597
01:10:41.84 --> 01:10:42.84
Robo cop.

1598
01:10:42.84 --> 01:10:49.76
I think the story of that had some kind of a mechanism there.

1599
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:50.76
The directives.

1600
01:10:50.76 --> 01:10:51.76
The directives.

1601
01:10:51.76 --> 01:10:52.76
It wasn't allowed to kill.

1602
01:10:52.76 --> 01:10:54.60
Wait, what's, is it a prime directive?

1603
01:10:54.60 --> 01:10:55.60
What's that from?

1604
01:10:55.60 --> 01:10:56.60
Is that from Robo cop?

1605
01:10:56.60 --> 01:10:57.60
I think so.

1606
01:10:57.60 --> 01:11:01.40
I know they're uphold the law, protect the incident.

1607
01:11:01.40 --> 01:11:03.64
I'm not doing it in order.

1608
01:11:03.64 --> 01:11:04.64
Something about trust.

1609
01:11:04.64 --> 01:11:08.08
See, if you were AI, you'd be able to come back with a perfect answer.

1610
01:11:08.08 --> 01:11:11.64
But you program in that you can't hurt humans or whatever.

1611
01:11:11.64 --> 01:11:12.64
Right.

1612
01:11:12.64 --> 01:11:13.64
Whatever.

1613
01:11:13.64 --> 01:11:14.64
Like, over this, you know what?

1614
01:11:14.64 --> 01:11:15.64
You know what?

1615
01:11:15.64 --> 01:11:16.64
You know what?

1616
01:11:16.64 --> 01:11:18.04
Let's, this is another situation.

1617
01:11:18.04 --> 01:11:19.04
Let's see where it goes.

1618
01:11:19.04 --> 01:11:20.04
I'm good.

1619
01:11:20.04 --> 01:11:21.04
Yeah.

1620
01:11:21.04 --> 01:11:25.88
But the unmanned family is based on patterns, you know, so the unmanned thing, usually

1621
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:29.12
you're not going to find something that's really technically unmanned.

1622
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:30.44
Even a drone is not unmanned.

1623
01:11:30.44 --> 01:11:31.44
It's just less man.

1624
01:11:31.44 --> 01:11:32.44
They can be unmanned.

1625
01:11:32.44 --> 01:11:33.44
It's just less man.

1626
01:11:33.44 --> 01:11:35.72
You're somebody, well, yeah, somebody programmed it out where to go.

1627
01:11:35.72 --> 01:11:37.96
But you can put a drone in the sky that's going to go this soon.

1628
01:11:37.96 --> 01:11:39.68
Yeah, but see what you say, you can put.

1629
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:40.92
Someone's got to put them in the sky.

1630
01:11:40.92 --> 01:11:41.92
Someone's got to have a launch.

1631
01:11:41.92 --> 01:11:42.92
Somebody's got to have a launch.

1632
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:43.92
So it's going to be manned.

1633
01:11:43.92 --> 01:11:47.56
Like, the intentions of something like that first intention of something is going to be

1634
01:11:47.56 --> 01:11:48.56
manned.

1635
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:52.60
Once you give that up then you're like, okay, now you got some problems.

1636
01:11:52.60 --> 01:11:53.60
Yeah.

1637
01:11:53.60 --> 01:11:57.80
Yeah, again, I'm just not sitting around worried about this kind of thing.

1638
01:11:57.80 --> 01:12:05.16
So I'll let Joe Rogan and Sam Harris and Elon Musk worry about keeping the robots

1639
01:12:05.16 --> 01:12:06.16
in line.

1640
01:12:06.16 --> 01:12:09.88
You know what, I'll be ready to fight him if they need me.

1641
01:12:09.88 --> 01:12:10.88
Bring it.

1642
01:12:10.88 --> 01:12:11.88
Yep.

1643
01:12:11.88 --> 01:12:12.88
Sure.

1644
01:12:12.88 --> 01:12:14.88
Next question.

1645
01:12:14.88 --> 01:12:17.48
Unless you want to talk about rule that somewhere.

1646
01:12:17.48 --> 01:12:18.48
No.

1647
01:12:18.48 --> 01:12:19.48
Or robot cup.

1648
01:12:19.48 --> 01:12:20.48
No.

1649
01:12:20.48 --> 01:12:20.48
Yeah.

1650
01:12:20.48 --> 01:12:22.04
See, even robot cup was manned.

1651
01:12:22.04 --> 01:12:23.52
He was a man, part man, part man.

1652
01:12:23.52 --> 01:12:28.36
No, but the big machine that the initial one that caused the problem is, who Ed Toon

1653
01:12:28.36 --> 01:12:29.36
9?

1654
01:12:29.36 --> 01:12:34.80
The thing that looks like a, they had big legs.

1655
01:12:34.80 --> 01:12:36.20
Yeah, Ed Toon 9, man.

1656
01:12:36.20 --> 01:12:37.20
Yeah.

1657
01:12:37.20 --> 01:12:38.20
The malfunction in murder.

1658
01:12:38.20 --> 01:12:39.20
Yeah.

1659
01:12:39.20 --> 01:12:41.20
You have four seconds to comply.

1660
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:42.20
Yeah.

1661
01:12:42.20 --> 01:12:43.56
You have three seconds to comply.

1662
01:12:43.56 --> 01:12:44.56
You have two seconds to comply.

1663
01:12:44.56 --> 01:12:45.56
Who shot it off?

1664
01:12:45.56 --> 01:12:48.44
Bro, the first time you watched that, bro, that was, that was tense.

1665
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:50.44
Well, that was a harsh scene.

1666
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:51.60
Oh, you loved it though.

1667
01:12:51.60 --> 01:12:54.28
Yeah, that was just so.

1668
01:12:54.28 --> 01:12:55.40
Ed Toon 9.

1669
01:12:55.40 --> 01:12:57.80
Jockel.

1670
01:12:57.80 --> 01:13:01.92
What's your favorite submission?

1671
01:13:01.92 --> 01:13:07.04
Real quick, again, trying to do a little rapid fire here, because people ask me this all

1672
01:13:07.04 --> 01:13:09.54
the time, favorite submissions.

1673
01:13:09.54 --> 01:13:11.92
Cause I got to go play all that one.

1674
01:13:11.92 --> 01:13:12.92
God.

1675
01:13:12.92 --> 01:13:15.56
But, uh, Camira and Guilletinseen, those are my two favorite submissions I think.

1676
01:13:15.56 --> 01:13:18.50
The reason why is because they're both really effective,

1677
01:13:18.50 --> 01:13:22.20
ghee and no ghee, they're both really effective

1678
01:13:23.76 --> 01:13:25.96
from the bottom, right?

1679
01:13:25.96 --> 01:13:27.20
You can do them from the top,

1680
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:28.48
you can do them from half guard,

1681
01:13:28.48 --> 01:13:30.08
you can do them from mount,

1682
01:13:30.08 --> 01:13:32.84
you can do them from a lot of different positions,

1683
01:13:32.84 --> 01:13:35.04
you can do them in the street,

1684
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:37.96
you can do them in MMA, and you can do them in GITS.

1685
01:13:37.96 --> 01:13:39.64
So I just like the fact that they're

1686
01:13:39.64 --> 01:13:42.56
kind of universal positions and very effective

1687
01:13:42.56 --> 01:13:45.32
in every aspect of GITS.

1688
01:13:45.32 --> 01:13:47.84
Yeah, yeah, those are good.

1689
01:13:47.84 --> 01:13:49.44
I'd go for the ghee or...

1690
01:13:49.44 --> 01:13:50.44
Rear and I could choke.

1691
01:13:50.44 --> 01:13:52.28
And the rear and I could choke for sure.

1692
01:13:52.28 --> 01:13:54.68
Yeah, those are ones that you don't,

1693
01:13:54.68 --> 01:13:58.40
like, they're big, they're like granddad.

1694
01:13:58.40 --> 01:14:00.96
There's a few of them, the granddaddy submissions.

1695
01:14:00.96 --> 01:14:02.12
Yeah.

1696
01:14:02.12 --> 01:14:05.72
Yeah, and you could say, Armlock is one of the granddaddies.

1697
01:14:05.72 --> 01:14:09.48
I just find the camera to be a higher percentage move.

1698
01:14:09.48 --> 01:14:10.48
Right, right.

1699
01:14:10.48 --> 01:14:12.88
Now lately, my last several years,

1700
01:14:12.88 --> 01:14:15.76
I've been using more straight arm locks again,

1701
01:14:15.76 --> 01:14:18.04
but like Armbarra that just a straight arm.

1702
01:14:18.04 --> 01:14:18.88
Both, yeah.

1703
01:14:18.88 --> 01:14:20.08
Both.

1704
01:14:20.08 --> 01:14:22.32
Because all my training partners are so good

1705
01:14:22.32 --> 01:14:23.32
at defending my community.

1706
01:14:23.32 --> 01:14:24.16
Yes.

1707
01:14:24.16 --> 01:14:27.16
That I have to go to alternate moves.

1708
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:29.08
Actually, I surprised you the other day with a,

1709
01:14:29.08 --> 01:14:31.56
you were kind of like, you were kind of depressed too.

1710
01:14:32.80 --> 01:14:34.12
You remember what I'm talking about?

1711
01:14:34.12 --> 01:14:35.88
Cause you like, cause a few weeks ago.

1712
01:14:35.88 --> 01:14:37.20
It was probably more than that.

1713
01:14:37.20 --> 01:14:38.72
But I remember your reaction,

1714
01:14:38.72 --> 01:14:41.20
your reaction was sort of, yeah.

1715
01:14:41.20 --> 01:14:43.28
Like, I can't believe he got me with Armlock.

1716
01:14:43.28 --> 01:14:45.76
And I even like made it a comment.

1717
01:14:45.76 --> 01:14:47.96
Yeah, you're in the role like when you were going for him.

1718
01:14:47.96 --> 01:14:50.16
Like, like, you're doing it.

1719
01:14:50.16 --> 01:14:53.000
And it's kind of like, turn up, turn up the heat.

1720
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.28
When I say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1721
01:14:54.28 --> 01:14:55.96
I don't like when people challenge.

1722
01:14:55.96 --> 01:14:56.96
It's very shallow.

1723
01:14:56.96 --> 01:14:58.12
It's a sharp turn.

1724
01:14:58.12 --> 01:14:59.20
It's a sharp turn.

1725
01:14:59.20 --> 01:15:00.04
All right.

1726
01:15:00.04 --> 01:15:00.88
Yeah, those are good.

1727
01:15:00.88 --> 01:15:03.04
I agree.

1728
01:15:03.04 --> 01:15:04.28
Next question.

1729
01:15:04.28 --> 01:15:05.72
Juck him.

1730
01:15:05.72 --> 01:15:08.20
You discussed making sure your teams have the freedom

1731
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:10.72
to make strategic changes to the plan

1732
01:15:10.72 --> 01:15:11.56
if needed.

1733
01:15:12.72 --> 01:15:15.16
What if you're developing a system with your team?

1734
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:17.44
And you begin to get push back from them

1735
01:15:17.44 --> 01:15:20.40
before you feel the core values are established?

1736
01:15:22.44 --> 01:15:25.96
So this is a really good question once again.

1737
01:15:27.04 --> 01:15:28.56
You start calling up with your plan.

1738
01:15:28.56 --> 01:15:29.96
And you already started getting some push back

1739
01:15:29.96 --> 01:15:32.56
from the boys on what it is.

1740
01:15:32.56 --> 01:15:33.44
Well, what do you do?

1741
01:15:33.44 --> 01:15:35.04
Listen to them.

1742
01:15:35.04 --> 01:15:36.20
Listen to them.

1743
01:15:36.20 --> 01:15:38.24
Why are they pushing back?

1744
01:15:38.24 --> 01:15:39.08
You know what I mean?

1745
01:15:39.08 --> 01:15:40.16
Why are they pushing back?

1746
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:42.12
Maybe they have some good points.

1747
01:15:42.12 --> 01:15:43.28
Is that possible?

1748
01:15:43.28 --> 01:15:47.44
Maybe you're a little bit off base on the plan

1749
01:15:47.44 --> 01:15:48.92
that you're coming up with or the strategy

1750
01:15:48.92 --> 01:15:50.20
that you're coming up with.

1751
01:15:50.20 --> 01:15:51.04
Maybe you're not.

1752
01:15:51.04 --> 01:15:52.08
Of course, that's always possible.

1753
01:15:52.08 --> 01:15:53.60
Do maybe they're wrong and you're right.

1754
01:15:53.60 --> 01:15:55.72
But here they're out.

1755
01:15:55.72 --> 01:15:58.96
You know, if I say, hey, we're going to hit the target

1756
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:01.08
from this direction here.

1757
01:16:01.08 --> 01:16:02.88
And my team disagrees with what I'm saying?

1758
01:16:02.88 --> 01:16:04.36
Well, why are they disagreeing?

1759
01:16:04.36 --> 01:16:06.52
What's the reason for that?

1760
01:16:06.52 --> 01:16:09.12
You know, how do they think we should do it?

1761
01:16:09.12 --> 01:16:11.40
They see the English are coming from the south

1762
01:16:11.40 --> 01:16:12.44
and I think we should come from the north.

1763
01:16:12.44 --> 01:16:13.68
Why do they think that?

1764
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:19.68
Now, if I know something is right and I am right,

1765
01:16:19.68 --> 01:16:20.48
then guess what?

1766
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:23.64
I can explain it to them and they'll say, oh,

1767
01:16:23.64 --> 01:16:25.68
Jocco, we didn't know that.

1768
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:27.36
We didn't know that there was defenses

1769
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:29.28
that we hadn't been told about to the south

1770
01:16:29.28 --> 01:16:31.32
and why that's why we should come into the north or we didn't

1771
01:16:31.32 --> 01:16:33.48
know that the sun would be at our back from the north

1772
01:16:33.48 --> 01:16:36.000
and that's why we didn't know that at the time.

1773
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.32
And so you're right.

1774
01:16:39.32 --> 01:16:41.76
Now, if I can't explain it to them,

1775
01:16:41.76 --> 01:16:43.32
if I can't give them a reason,

1776
01:16:43.32 --> 01:16:45.72
why my strategy or my plan is better,

1777
01:16:45.72 --> 01:16:47.72
then there's something wrong with my plan.

1778
01:16:47.72 --> 01:16:49.28
Or there's something wrong with my ability

1779
01:16:49.28 --> 01:16:52.12
to explain it to them.

1780
01:16:53.12 --> 01:16:55.68
So, if you're doing the right things for the right reasons,

1781
01:16:55.68 --> 01:16:57.60
you'll be able to convince your team

1782
01:16:57.60 --> 01:16:59.68
of the strategy or of the plan.

1783
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:03.40
And if you can't, it's a hint

1784
01:17:03.40 --> 01:17:06.20
that maybe you need to adapt your strategy

1785
01:17:06.20 --> 01:17:08.32
or maybe you need to adapt your plan.

1786
01:17:08.32 --> 01:17:11.28
Now be advised, this is not easy.

1787
01:17:12.40 --> 01:17:13.88
This is not easy to do.

1788
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.92
First of all, you have to get your ego in check, right?

1789
01:17:16.92 --> 01:17:18.52
Because you think you've come up with the plan

1790
01:17:18.52 --> 01:17:19.60
and you think it's the master plan.

1791
01:17:19.60 --> 01:17:23.04
So you have to put your ego in check.

1792
01:17:23.04 --> 01:17:26.32
Secondly, you might actually have the best plan,

1793
01:17:26.32 --> 01:17:29.68
but maybe you don't have the ability

1794
01:17:29.68 --> 01:17:33.000
to articulate the nuances of the plan.

1795
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.20
And so your guys, you get a guy that's a really articulate guy

1796
01:17:36.20 --> 01:17:38.60
that's arguing with you on his plan.

1797
01:17:38.60 --> 01:17:40.40
And he's actually winning the argument,

1798
01:17:40.40 --> 01:17:42.88
even though your plan might be better.

1799
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:44.80
That's a tough situation to be in.

1800
01:17:44.80 --> 01:17:49.80
So that means you've got to really get in the weeds.

1801
01:17:50.32 --> 01:17:52.56
Now, one thing that you could do in that situation

1802
01:17:52.56 --> 01:17:56.12
is say, hey, I'm in charge, shut up, listen to me.

1803
01:17:58.68 --> 01:18:00.72
And again, this might be a situation where you're right

1804
01:18:00.72 --> 01:18:02.76
and they're wrong, but if you can't articulate

1805
01:18:02.76 --> 01:18:04.72
that properly, and now you only way to do it

1806
01:18:04.72 --> 01:18:06.36
is to pull right on them.

1807
01:18:06.36 --> 01:18:09.04
Hey, you're gonna go backwards, right?

1808
01:18:09.04 --> 01:18:09.96
You're gonna go backwards.

1809
01:18:09.96 --> 01:18:13.08
So you have to be very careful of that.

1810
01:18:13.08 --> 01:18:17.76
Again, this is why it's important to have good command

1811
01:18:17.76 --> 01:18:18.80
of the English language.

1812
01:18:18.80 --> 01:18:20.32
That's why it's important to listen.

1813
01:18:20.32 --> 01:18:24.52
That's why it's important to take people's ideas.

1814
01:18:24.52 --> 01:18:26.68
And that's the thing with being a leader, okay?

1815
01:18:26.68 --> 01:18:31.68
I have an open mind, I have open ears, listen,

1816
01:18:34.76 --> 01:18:37.96
communicate and lead your team.

1817
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:41.56
Not by rank, right?

1818
01:18:41.56 --> 01:18:46.56
But by being able to discern and uncover

1819
01:18:47.84 --> 01:18:51.64
and mold and shape the best possible plan

1820
01:18:51.64 --> 01:18:53.60
and the best possible strategy

1821
01:18:53.60 --> 01:18:58.60
by and through understanding everyone's perspectives

1822
01:18:58.60 --> 01:19:02.60
and ideas and then taking all those perspectives

1823
01:19:02.60 --> 01:19:05.16
and all those ideas and coordinating them

1824
01:19:05.16 --> 01:19:10.16
into a unified thought that leads the team to victory.

1825
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:12.12
That is hard.

1826
01:19:13.12 --> 01:19:14.40
That is hard to do.

1827
01:19:14.40 --> 01:19:15.56
Yeah.

1828
01:19:15.56 --> 01:19:17.84
But the minute, again, the minute that I'm telling

1829
01:19:17.84 --> 01:19:21.36
somebody, hey, no, just do it my way.

1830
01:19:21.36 --> 01:19:23.76
I know that there's something wrong here.

1831
01:19:23.76 --> 01:19:25.96
Either I'm not articulating, right?

1832
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:28.36
Which means I should take the time

1833
01:19:28.36 --> 01:19:30.44
because if I'm right in your wrong,

1834
01:19:31.60 --> 01:19:35.12
we should be able to get there to where you see that.

1835
01:19:35.12 --> 01:19:36.32
We should be able to get there.

1836
01:19:36.32 --> 01:19:39.72
We could also get to a point where it's 61.5 does in the other.

1837
01:19:39.72 --> 01:19:40.56
Right?

1838
01:19:40.56 --> 01:19:41.72
We could get to that point too.

1839
01:19:41.72 --> 01:19:43.24
And at that point, you know what I'm gonna do?

1840
01:19:43.24 --> 01:19:44.60
You know what I'm gonna do?

1841
01:19:44.60 --> 01:19:46.12
I'm gonna use your plan.

1842
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:48.84
If it's 61.5 does the other, I'm gonna use your plan.

1843
01:19:48.84 --> 01:19:50.52
Echo says, come in from the North,

1844
01:19:50.52 --> 01:19:52.12
I say come in from the West.

1845
01:19:53.24 --> 01:19:56.04
We look at the pros and cons of each.

1846
01:19:56.04 --> 01:19:56.96
I'm gonna go with your plan.

1847
01:19:56.96 --> 01:19:58.32
Would you want to come in from the West?

1848
01:19:58.32 --> 01:19:59.16
Yeah, okay.

1849
01:19:59.16 --> 01:20:01.80
If it's 50, 50, I'm gonna go with your plan.

1850
01:20:01.80 --> 01:20:02.64
I'm gonna give it to you.

1851
01:20:02.64 --> 01:20:04.84
I'm gonna give you the ownership.

1852
01:20:04.84 --> 01:20:06.72
That's what I'm gonna do.

1853
01:20:06.72 --> 01:20:11.12
Even, I'll tell you, even, 60, 40.

1854
01:20:11.12 --> 01:20:12.84
I'm probably gonna give it to you.

1855
01:20:12.84 --> 01:20:14.96
We get to, you know, 70, 30.

1856
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:16.80
Now you're gonna see it.

1857
01:20:16.80 --> 01:20:18.76
You're gonna see the light.

1858
01:20:18.76 --> 01:20:20.12
If you have any brain,

1859
01:20:20.12 --> 01:20:22.32
now you could also be an Eagle maniac.

1860
01:20:22.32 --> 01:20:23.16
Right?

1861
01:20:23.16 --> 01:20:24.44
Who's like, my way, my way, my way.

1862
01:20:24.44 --> 01:20:26.16
Now we've got to break through that.

1863
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:27.16
How do we do that?

1864
01:20:27.16 --> 01:20:29.16
It's not by attacking your plan,

1865
01:20:29.16 --> 01:20:30.72
which you're gonna defend

1866
01:20:30.72 --> 01:20:32.44
because you're an Eagle maniac.

1867
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:33.60
Instead, I'm gonna say,

1868
01:20:33.60 --> 01:20:35.16
well, tell me the benefits of your plan.

1869
01:20:35.16 --> 01:20:37.000
Let's weigh it out between your plan and my plan.

1870
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.44
Maybe we adapt your plan a little bit.

1871
01:20:38.44 --> 01:20:39.32
Oh, I like what you did here.

1872
01:20:39.32 --> 01:20:40.20
I see where you're coming from.

1873
01:20:40.20 --> 01:20:41.16
That's a really good point.

1874
01:20:41.16 --> 01:20:43.16
I didn't think of that.

1875
01:20:43.16 --> 01:20:45.20
But also we need to consider this

1876
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:47.68
that I didn't, you know, we didn't know before.

1877
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:48.52
So now we got to adjust.

1878
01:20:48.52 --> 01:20:50.92
So those are the things that are hard.

1879
01:20:52.20 --> 01:20:53.96
Those are the things that are hard about being a leader.

1880
01:20:53.96 --> 01:20:55.88
But the best thing you can do,

1881
01:20:55.88 --> 01:20:57.56
open your mind, open your ears,

1882
01:20:57.56 --> 01:20:59.16
listen to what people are saying,

1883
01:20:59.16 --> 01:21:00.36
take it on board,

1884
01:21:00.36 --> 01:21:01.80
if their plan is better than yours,

1885
01:21:01.80 --> 01:21:03.52
great use it.

1886
01:21:03.52 --> 01:21:05.64
If it's not better than yours,

1887
01:21:05.64 --> 01:21:07.96
okay, articulate the reasons why.

1888
01:21:07.96 --> 01:21:09.60
Have the conversations with them.

1889
01:21:09.60 --> 01:21:10.92
Don't be scared.

1890
01:21:10.92 --> 01:21:11.96
It's a slick move.

1891
01:21:11.96 --> 01:21:14.08
I didn't think of that.

1892
01:21:14.08 --> 01:21:14.92
Oh, for you.

1893
01:21:14.92 --> 01:21:16.24
That's nice.

1894
01:21:16.24 --> 01:21:19.44
Got to build up the ego if they got their baby ego.

1895
01:21:19.44 --> 01:21:21.000
We got to find a flank.

1896
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:21.84
Yeah.

1897
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:24.32
Yeah, it's good.

1898
01:21:24.32 --> 01:21:27.04
Get other people's perspectives.

1899
01:21:27.04 --> 01:21:29.32
Because it can seem like a 50 50

1900
01:21:29.32 --> 01:21:33.60
or it can seem like 60 40, you know.

1901
01:21:33.60 --> 01:21:37.88
But it can also seem like a 64 or 70 30,

1902
01:21:37.88 --> 01:21:38.92
your plan is better,

1903
01:21:38.92 --> 01:21:39.92
but to them 70 30,

1904
01:21:39.92 --> 01:21:41.80
their plan is better because of their perspective.

1905
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:42.64
Let's say they,

1906
01:21:42.64 --> 01:21:43.68
they, there's rats.

1907
01:21:43.68 --> 01:21:45.000
Drawing down this trail.

1908
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.84
Yeah.

1909
01:21:45.84 --> 01:21:46.84
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1910
01:21:46.84 --> 01:21:47.84
If you didn't know that,

1911
01:21:47.84 --> 01:21:48.24
you know, you're like,

1912
01:21:48.24 --> 01:21:49.84
for rats who cares kind of thing.

1913
01:21:49.84 --> 01:21:50.84
Yeah.

1914
01:21:50.84 --> 01:21:51.84
Dang.

1915
01:21:51.84 --> 01:21:52.84
Really, you're dead.

1916
01:21:52.84 --> 01:21:54.84
Dogs would be a better thing.

1917
01:21:54.84 --> 01:21:55.84
Sure.

1918
01:21:55.84 --> 01:21:56.84
To say rats aren't going to interfere with your mission.

1919
01:21:56.84 --> 01:21:57.84
Dogs start barking.

1920
01:21:57.84 --> 01:21:59.84
And maybe they had,

1921
01:21:59.84 --> 01:22:00.84
they had somebody,

1922
01:22:00.84 --> 01:22:01.84
they read an intel report that said,

1923
01:22:01.84 --> 01:22:03.84
there was a bunch of dogs up in this,

1924
01:22:03.84 --> 01:22:04.84
this, you know,

1925
01:22:04.84 --> 01:22:05.84
residents to the north.

1926
01:22:05.84 --> 01:22:07.84
So we want to come in from the west.

1927
01:22:07.84 --> 01:22:08.84
I didn't know that.

1928
01:22:08.84 --> 01:22:09.84
I didn't do good.

1929
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:11.84
So now it's easy, easy thing to convince me of.

1930
01:22:11.84 --> 01:22:12.84
Yeah.

1931
01:22:12.84 --> 01:22:14.84
But all we have to do is have the conversation.

1932
01:22:14.84 --> 01:22:15.84
Yeah.

1933
01:22:15.84 --> 01:22:16.84
Understand the perspective.

1934
01:22:16.84 --> 01:22:17.84
Talk and communicate.

1935
01:22:17.84 --> 01:22:18.84
Dogs dogs.

1936
01:22:18.84 --> 01:22:19.84
With your ages.

1937
01:22:19.84 --> 01:22:20.84
Put your egos and check.

1938
01:22:20.84 --> 01:22:21.84
Yeah.

1939
01:22:21.84 --> 01:22:22.84
Or snakes, by the way,

1940
01:22:22.84 --> 01:22:23.84
if you're in the end of your illness,

1941
01:22:23.84 --> 01:22:24.84
or something like this.

1942
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:26.84
Next question.

1943
01:22:30.84 --> 01:22:31.84
Jockel.

1944
01:22:31.84 --> 01:22:38.84
Have you encountered any gaps in the leadership capabilities of officers from west point or the other academy?

1945
01:22:38.84 --> 01:22:39.84
Okay.

1946
01:22:39.84 --> 01:22:42.84
So for those of you don't know what the service academies are.

1947
01:22:42.84 --> 01:22:46.84
There's West Point. There's the Naval Academy, which gives you Navy and Marine Corps officers.

1948
01:22:46.84 --> 01:22:53.84
West Point gives you Army officers the Air Force Academy gives you Air Force officers and the Coast Guard Academy gives you Coast Guard officers.

1949
01:22:53.84 --> 01:22:55.84
There are four years.

1950
01:22:55.84 --> 01:22:56.84
Their military school.

1951
01:22:56.84 --> 01:22:57.84
They're really hard to get into.

1952
01:22:57.84 --> 01:22:59.84
They're extremely competitive.

1953
01:22:59.84 --> 01:23:02.84
They have massive amount of tradition at all of them.

1954
01:23:02.84 --> 01:23:05.84
And they are highly disciplined and hard to get through.

1955
01:23:05.84 --> 01:23:08.84
So.

1956
01:23:08.84 --> 01:23:10.84
You would think.

1957
01:23:10.84 --> 01:23:18.84
Right. That what I just said would produce a and a standard, a very high standard of an outstanding officer.

1958
01:23:18.84 --> 01:23:21.84
The fact of the matter is in my career.

1959
01:23:21.84 --> 01:23:24.84
It really makes no difference.

1960
01:23:24.84 --> 01:23:29.84
It's because there's other ways that you can have officers, other avenues that officers come from.

1961
01:23:29.84 --> 01:23:39.84
They can come from ROTC, which is when you know you go to a regular college and you basically take classes about being an officer and you get shown how to wear uniform and all that.

1962
01:23:39.84 --> 01:23:48.84
You go to OCS, which is when you graduate from college, you go to a program for 13 weeks or however long each service has a little bit different in the Navy.

1963
01:23:48.84 --> 01:23:50.84
For me, I went to OCS. It was 13 weeks.

1964
01:23:50.84 --> 01:23:52.84
That was after being enlisted for eight years.

1965
01:23:52.84 --> 01:23:54.84
You know, you can be a priori.

1966
01:23:54.84 --> 01:23:57.84
I like me, which is you get your commission after you've been in the military.

1967
01:23:57.84 --> 01:23:59.84
And so all those.

1968
01:23:59.84 --> 01:24:06.84
I've I had outstanding officers or I worked without standing officers from each one of those commissioning sources.

1969
01:24:06.84 --> 01:24:18.84
I had outstanding naval academy guys, outstanding West Point guys, outstanding ROTC guys, outstanding OCS guys, just outstanding guys.

1970
01:24:18.84 --> 01:24:20.84
Great leaders.

1971
01:24:20.84 --> 01:24:21.84
And guess what?

1972
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:24.84
I also had crap leaders that were from the academy.

1973
01:24:24.84 --> 01:24:29.84
Crap leaders that were from West Point, crap leaders that were from OCS, crap leaders that from ROTC.

1974
01:24:29.84 --> 01:24:39.84
So and crap. And by the way, probably the the biggest example of the disparity of good and bad is prior and listed.

1975
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:46.84
So prior and listed means that you are an enlisted grunt, you are a frontline trooper in the Seal teams are in the military.

1976
01:24:46.84 --> 01:24:49.84
And then you get your commission. That's what I did.

1977
01:24:49.84 --> 01:24:52.84
And I had great officers that were like that.

1978
01:24:52.84 --> 01:24:55.84
And I also knew horrible officers that were like that.

1979
01:24:55.84 --> 01:25:00.84
So for me, it doesn't really matter what your commissioning source is.

1980
01:25:00.84 --> 01:25:05.84
It matters who you are as a person and who you are as a leader.

1981
01:25:05.84 --> 01:25:16.84
And if you have those characteristics that make you a good leader, if you're humble, if you listen, if you're dynamic, if you're articulate, all those things that make a good leader.

1982
01:25:16.84 --> 01:25:20.84
If you have them, it doesn't really matter your commissioning source.

1983
01:25:20.84 --> 01:25:24.84
And if you don't have them, doesn't really matter your commissioning source.

1984
01:25:24.84 --> 01:25:28.84
That's what I've experienced in my time.

1985
01:25:28.84 --> 01:25:39.84
So it is interesting. I thought when I first joined the military, I thought these guys that came from the Naval Academy that I'm going to work with in the Seal teams.

1986
01:25:39.84 --> 01:25:47.84
They're going to be really awesome because they went to four years of leadership training and learning how to lead.

1987
01:25:47.84 --> 01:25:53.84
And I mean, Brian stands a great example, right? You can hear he got a lot out of the level of the Naval Academy.

1988
01:25:53.84 --> 01:25:57.84
Well, it's on just the way he talked about it.

1989
01:25:57.84 --> 01:26:03.84
I bet that Brian stand would be an outstanding officer.

1990
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:09.84
If he went to the Naval Academy, if he went to OCS or if he went to ROTC, he's got a great.

1991
01:26:09.84 --> 01:26:13.84
Did he learn lessons there? Yes, but he had an open mind to learn those things.

1992
01:26:13.84 --> 01:26:23.84
And so yeah, the service academies are definitely awesome and really great tradition in all those.

1993
01:26:23.84 --> 01:26:28.84
But I don't think you need to go to a service academy to be a good officer.

1994
01:26:28.84 --> 01:26:33.84
And I don't think it really matters what matters is what kind of leader and person you are.

1995
01:26:33.84 --> 01:26:40.84
Is that the kind of deal where you just never know who you're going to get at the end because some people they're really good at.

1996
01:26:40.84 --> 01:26:45.84
You know, these people don't get really good grades, but out in the field they do substandard performance wise.

1997
01:26:45.84 --> 01:26:50.84
Because they're good at getting good grades or they're good at taking classes kind of thing.

1998
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:52.84
Good memorizing or whatever.

1999
01:26:52.84 --> 01:26:53.84
Yeah, yeah.

2000
01:26:53.84 --> 01:26:54.84
And then yeah, interesting.

2001
01:26:54.84 --> 01:26:56.84
But you don't know what you're getting as a person.

2002
01:26:56.84 --> 01:26:58.84
Well, how are they brought up?

2003
01:26:58.84 --> 01:26:58.84
Right.

2004
01:26:58.84 --> 01:27:01.84
You know, Brian stands story cool about how he got brought up.

2005
01:27:01.84 --> 01:27:08.84
You know, he just very, you could see that he wasn't taught his leadership ability in my opinion.

2006
01:27:08.84 --> 01:27:10.84
At the Naval Academy did he learn there?

2007
01:27:10.84 --> 01:27:11.84
Yes.

2008
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:12.84
Did he take away a lot from it?

2009
01:27:12.84 --> 01:27:13.84
Yes.

2010
01:27:13.84 --> 01:27:17.84
Anybody that heard him would probably think, definitely would would love to go to the Naval Academy.

2011
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:20.84
But you know, you listen to his story of his life.

2012
01:27:20.84 --> 01:27:27.84
He learned a lot prior to he learned a lot at when he was at the TBS, the basics.

2013
01:27:27.84 --> 01:27:29.84
Well, he just learned a lot and he had an open mind.

2014
01:27:29.84 --> 01:27:31.84
He was a humble guy and a hard worker.

2015
01:27:31.84 --> 01:27:33.84
That's what makes you a great officer.

2016
01:27:33.84 --> 01:27:36.84
You know, that type of thing.

2017
01:27:36.84 --> 01:27:38.84
Yeah.

2018
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:40.84
Next question.

2019
01:27:40.84 --> 01:27:46.84
Do smaller built dudes have a niche for SLF world for the SLF world?

2020
01:27:46.84 --> 01:27:47.84
Soft world.

2021
01:27:47.84 --> 01:27:48.84
Yeah.

2022
01:27:48.84 --> 01:27:50.84
Special operations forces.

2023
01:27:50.84 --> 01:27:51.84
Yeah.

2024
01:27:51.84 --> 01:27:52.84
Do you say soft?

2025
01:27:52.84 --> 01:27:53.84
Yeah.

2026
01:27:53.84 --> 01:27:54.84
No, no, no, no.

2027
01:27:54.84 --> 01:27:54.84
Okay.

2028
01:27:54.84 --> 01:27:58.84
Smaller built dudes have a niche for the soft world.

2029
01:27:58.84 --> 01:28:03.84
Any advantages, disadvantages with physical size or of operators?

2030
01:28:03.84 --> 01:28:06.84
Well, the special ops guys coming all shapes inside of this.

2031
01:28:06.84 --> 01:28:09.84
For sure, they are.

2032
01:28:09.84 --> 01:28:12.84
Can be big giant monster guys and they can be little tiny skinny,

2033
01:28:12.84 --> 01:28:15.84
Yery guys and that's the way it is.

2034
01:28:15.84 --> 01:28:19.84
And they're all needed in in the special operations community.

2035
01:28:19.84 --> 01:28:23.84
You know, if you look at your average point man, your average point man is a

2036
01:28:23.84 --> 01:28:28.84
Yery light guy that's quick and nimble and.

2037
01:28:28.84 --> 01:28:30.84
You look at your average machine gunner.

2038
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:34.84
He's a big, awesome dude that can tow it around a bunch of weight.

2039
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:39.84
But also there's a bunch of skinny, little guys that are carrying a machine gun.

2040
01:28:39.84 --> 01:28:42.84
There's some big guys that walk point.

2041
01:28:42.84 --> 01:28:43.84
And that's the way it is.

2042
01:28:43.84 --> 01:28:48.84
So is there is there a niche for certain body types?

2043
01:28:48.84 --> 01:28:54.84
Yeah, I mean, there is if you're a big guy, you should carry something big like a

2044
01:28:54.84 --> 01:28:56.84
like a machine gun.

2045
01:28:56.84 --> 01:29:02.84
If you're a small guy, you should try and be in a situation where you're carrying a

2046
01:29:02.84 --> 01:29:06.84
little bit of a lighter load like a point man or a weird security dude.

2047
01:29:06.84 --> 01:29:11.84
But both do both and there's a bunch of other, I mean, you know, you look at a

2048
01:29:11.84 --> 01:29:15.84
radio man, radio man's got to carry a ton of weight too.

2049
01:29:15.84 --> 01:29:19.84
So yeah, there's no real, there's no real.

2050
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:21.84
Advantage or disadvantage.

2051
01:29:21.84 --> 01:29:24.84
I would say you don't want to be that big.

2052
01:29:24.84 --> 01:29:28.84
And you don't want to be that small, but if you are.

2053
01:29:28.84 --> 01:29:30.84
Get some, you know, get some.

2054
01:29:30.84 --> 01:29:31.84
There's just the way it is.

2055
01:29:31.84 --> 01:29:35.84
There's going to be things that are way harder for a bigger guy.

2056
01:29:35.84 --> 01:29:39.84
In the seal teams and in special operations, and there's going to be things that are

2057
01:29:39.84 --> 01:29:40.84
harder for a smaller guy.

2058
01:29:40.84 --> 01:29:41.84
And that's the way it is.

2059
01:29:41.84 --> 01:29:47.84
So, you know, if you've got to do submarine lockouts and you're a big guy,

2060
01:29:47.84 --> 01:29:53.84
you're going to be in a little escape trunk, a little six foot sphere with a bunch of gear

2061
01:29:53.84 --> 01:29:54.84
in there.

2062
01:29:54.84 --> 01:29:56.84
It's not fun to be a big giant guy at that point.

2063
01:29:56.84 --> 01:29:57.84
No.

2064
01:29:57.84 --> 01:30:02.84
And when you get to the beach after you lock out the submarine, and you're going to carry

2065
01:30:02.84 --> 01:30:07.84
a 55 horsepower motor across the beach into a cash site, and you're, you weigh

2066
01:30:07.84 --> 01:30:08.84
143 pounds.

2067
01:30:08.84 --> 01:30:10.84
That's not going to be fun for you.

2068
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:15.84
You want that big 260 pounder to come over and throw that motor on a shoulder and

2069
01:30:15.84 --> 01:30:16.84
carry it into position.

2070
01:30:16.84 --> 01:30:19.84
So that's why you have everything at a seal pool tune.

2071
01:30:19.84 --> 01:30:22.84
That's why diversity is good in terms of body styles.

2072
01:30:22.84 --> 01:30:26.84
Next question.

2073
01:30:26.84 --> 01:30:28.84
Good morning.

2074
01:30:28.84 --> 01:30:33.84
Do you ever get edgy, perhaps, hangry?

2075
01:30:33.84 --> 01:30:35.84
You know, the end of a fast.

2076
01:30:35.84 --> 01:30:37.84
If so, how do you deal with it?

2077
01:30:37.84 --> 01:30:41.84
I tend to have more difficulty controlling my emotions during the last few hours.

2078
01:30:41.84 --> 01:30:42.84
Thank you.

2079
01:30:42.84 --> 01:30:48.84
Anyone that listens to me very often will probably know what I'm going to say here.

2080
01:30:48.84 --> 01:30:53.84
If you think you're going to get edgy or you think you're going to get angry, just be

2081
01:30:53.84 --> 01:30:58.84
of aware of it and don't get angry.

2082
01:30:58.84 --> 01:30:59.84
Next question.

2083
01:30:59.84 --> 01:31:00.84
You know what I mean?

2084
01:31:00.84 --> 01:31:05.84
Like, yeah, if you're hungry and you're frustrated because you have an eaten and now it's

2085
01:31:05.84 --> 01:31:08.84
starting to get to you, just don't do that.

2086
01:31:08.84 --> 01:31:09.84
Yeah.

2087
01:31:09.84 --> 01:31:15.84
I actually, it's kind of like what you're talking earlier about surfing without a leash or about,

2088
01:31:15.84 --> 01:31:17.84
you know, parachuting under a pressure situation where I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

2089
01:31:17.84 --> 01:31:19.84
But I'm going to do it anyways.

2090
01:31:19.84 --> 01:31:21.84
And I get focused on it.

2091
01:31:21.84 --> 01:31:22.84
It's the same thing for me.

2092
01:31:22.84 --> 01:31:33.84
When I'm doing a fast, I actually enjoy the fact that I'm under some excessive stressful situation.

2093
01:31:33.84 --> 01:31:36.84
In fact, I have a like, it better.

2094
01:31:36.84 --> 01:31:38.84
You know, I want to feel that.

2095
01:31:38.84 --> 01:31:44.84
And then I want to be like, I want to say to myself, hey, you might get frustrated right now because

2096
01:31:44.84 --> 01:31:48.84
you haven't eaten and your blood sugars low.

2097
01:31:48.84 --> 01:31:54.84
But I'm going to be, I'm going to use the echo Charles approach of, hey, that's weakness, right?

2098
01:31:54.84 --> 01:31:56.84
It's weakness for me to be getting angry.

2099
01:31:56.84 --> 01:32:00.84
It's weak for me to be complaining because I'm on a tail end of a 72 hour fast.

2100
01:32:00.84 --> 01:32:01.84
That's just weakness.

2101
01:32:01.84 --> 01:32:02.84
Not going to complain.

2102
01:32:02.84 --> 01:32:03.84
What are you talking about?

2103
01:32:03.84 --> 01:32:05.84
You don't need to eat for 30 days.

2104
01:32:05.84 --> 01:32:08.84
People can go for 30 days without eating.

2105
01:32:08.84 --> 01:32:13.84
My daughter, which she was cutting weight for wrestling this past season, she would say that.

2106
01:32:13.84 --> 01:32:16.84
She'd say, you know, I'd be getting, she'd say, you know, dad, I would get really hungry.

2107
01:32:16.84 --> 01:32:19.84
And then I just think people can live for 30 days without eating.

2108
01:32:19.84 --> 01:32:21.84
I think I can make up through the next eight hours.

2109
01:32:21.84 --> 01:32:22.84
Come on.

2110
01:32:22.84 --> 01:32:22.84
Yeah, yeah.

2111
01:32:22.84 --> 01:32:23.84
It's not that big of a deal.

2112
01:32:23.84 --> 01:32:24.84
There's no reason to get angry.

2113
01:32:24.84 --> 01:32:26.84
That's just an excuse.

2114
01:32:26.84 --> 01:32:27.84
Don't do it.

2115
01:32:27.84 --> 01:32:30.84
Carry on with your airborne self.

2116
01:32:30.84 --> 01:32:34.84
I'll see you know, I'll sit this before.

2117
01:32:34.84 --> 01:32:37.84
There's a difference between how you feel and then how you behave.

2118
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:40.84
You know, you can get angry on the inside.

2119
01:32:40.84 --> 01:32:45.84
But once you start behaving like, you did some man get angry on the inside.

2120
01:32:45.84 --> 01:32:46.84
Yeah.

2121
01:32:46.84 --> 01:32:47.84
Exactly.

2122
01:32:47.84 --> 01:32:49.84
A trading place.

2123
01:32:49.84 --> 01:32:50.84
Yeah.

2124
01:32:50.84 --> 01:32:51.84
Very good.

2125
01:32:51.84 --> 01:32:53.84
You know, actually now, I think about it.

2126
01:32:53.84 --> 01:32:55.84
When I was doing deployments.

2127
01:32:55.84 --> 01:32:57.84
Drinking dirty.

2128
01:32:57.84 --> 01:33:02.84
Back in the day in the 90s, we watched, there was nothing to do on a ship.

2129
01:33:02.84 --> 01:33:03.84
We didn't have an internet.

2130
01:33:03.84 --> 01:33:04.84
No one wrote us letters.

2131
01:33:04.84 --> 01:33:05.84
No one cared about us.

2132
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:06.84
There was no.

2133
01:33:06.84 --> 01:33:09.84
So all we did was play spades and watch movies.

2134
01:33:09.84 --> 01:33:11.84
And when movies, we watched for on video tape.

2135
01:33:11.84 --> 01:33:12.84
Mm-hmm.

2136
01:33:12.84 --> 01:33:16.84
Because this is broken today before CDs before Netflix.

2137
01:33:16.84 --> 01:33:19.84
You had video tape when we had a great full of videos.

2138
01:33:19.84 --> 01:33:24.84
And so we were watching the same, you know, cheesy movies over and over and over.

2139
01:33:24.84 --> 01:33:26.84
Get it probably trading places was one of them.

2140
01:33:26.84 --> 01:33:27.84
Yeah.

2141
01:33:27.84 --> 01:33:34.84
So if you go back further in the movies, you're not, because what are my five years older than you?

2142
01:33:34.84 --> 01:33:35.84
Yeah.

2143
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:36.84
Five or six years.

2144
01:33:36.84 --> 01:33:37.84
Yeah.

2145
01:33:37.84 --> 01:33:39.84
Five or six years ahead of you on movies.

2146
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:42.84
So there's a whole bunch of cheesy movies that I actually know about.

2147
01:33:42.84 --> 01:33:43.84
Oh yeah.

2148
01:33:43.84 --> 01:33:44.84
That you might not know about.

2149
01:33:44.84 --> 01:33:45.84
Yeah.

2150
01:33:45.84 --> 01:33:47.84
And occasionally we're getting an overlap.

2151
01:33:47.84 --> 01:33:48.84
Yeah.

2152
01:33:48.84 --> 01:33:49.84
Trading places.

2153
01:33:49.84 --> 01:33:50.84
I can't agree.

2154
01:33:50.84 --> 01:33:52.84
And Murphy the Man.

2155
01:33:52.84 --> 01:33:53.84
Oh yeah.

2156
01:33:53.84 --> 01:33:54.84
But hangry, right?

2157
01:33:54.84 --> 01:33:55.84
Karate Man.

2158
01:33:55.84 --> 01:33:56.84
But you don't have the inside.

2159
01:33:56.84 --> 01:33:58.84
Ha ha ha.

2160
01:33:58.84 --> 01:34:00.84
Hang.

2161
01:34:00.84 --> 01:34:01.84
I like that word.

2162
01:34:01.84 --> 01:34:02.84
Hangry by the way.

2163
01:34:02.84 --> 01:34:03.84
That's in.

2164
01:34:03.84 --> 01:34:04.84
20.

2165
01:34:04.84 --> 01:34:08.84
But that implies that you're kind of like, oh, I'm hangry.

2166
01:34:08.84 --> 01:34:10.84
You know, like, like you're expressing yourself.

2167
01:34:10.84 --> 01:34:11.84
Yeah.

2168
01:34:11.84 --> 01:34:12.84
You know, don't express yourself.

2169
01:34:12.84 --> 01:34:13.84
Yeah.

2170
01:34:13.84 --> 01:34:16.84
Your emotions can keep it on the end and act like a winner.

2171
01:34:16.84 --> 01:34:20.84
If you feel like a loser on the inside, you can feel hangry.

2172
01:34:20.84 --> 01:34:22.84
But act like don't act like that.

2173
01:34:22.84 --> 01:34:23.84
Don't let it be clear.

2174
01:34:23.84 --> 01:34:27.84
Other people see you be all pathetic like that.

2175
01:34:27.84 --> 01:34:28.84
It's been like, oh, yeah.

2176
01:34:28.84 --> 01:34:29.84
I haven't eaten in four days.

2177
01:34:29.84 --> 01:34:30.84
Whatever.

2178
01:34:30.84 --> 01:34:31.84
You know what?

2179
01:34:31.84 --> 01:34:32.84
Do you hear this joke?

2180
01:34:32.84 --> 01:34:34.84
Yeah.

2181
01:34:34.84 --> 01:34:36.84
I mean, just, hey, I haven't eaten in six days.

2182
01:34:36.84 --> 01:34:37.84
No big deal.

2183
01:34:37.84 --> 01:34:38.84
Yeah.

2184
01:34:38.84 --> 01:34:39.84
I'm going to go to train your jitter.

2185
01:34:39.84 --> 01:34:40.84
What are you doing?

2186
01:34:40.84 --> 01:34:41.84
Yeah.

2187
01:34:41.84 --> 01:34:42.84
Real.

2188
01:34:42.84 --> 01:34:43.84
So yeah.

2189
01:34:43.84 --> 01:34:44.84
Oh, what are you doing?

2190
01:34:44.84 --> 01:34:46.84
Sitting around being weak.

2191
01:34:46.84 --> 01:34:47.84
Don't do that.

2192
01:34:47.84 --> 01:34:49.84
I'll be over here doing something else.

2193
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:50.84
Yeah.

2194
01:34:50.84 --> 01:34:53.84
So yeah, separate your feeling and your behavior.

2195
01:34:53.84 --> 01:34:54.84
And typically, one is the thing.

2196
01:34:54.84 --> 01:34:56.84
And you know, you even have a word for it.

2197
01:34:56.84 --> 01:34:57.84
Yeah.

2198
01:34:57.84 --> 01:34:58.84
You just got like, you crept up on you.

2199
01:34:58.84 --> 01:35:00.84
And I had no control over it.

2200
01:35:00.84 --> 01:35:01.84
No.

2201
01:35:01.84 --> 01:35:02.84
I don't know if I had it.

2202
01:35:02.84 --> 01:35:03.84
Gave in a name, everything.

2203
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:06.84
And if, I mean, if Mike's very serves me.

2204
01:35:06.84 --> 01:35:10.84
A lot of times when people say like, oh, I've, I get hungry or I'm,

2205
01:35:10.84 --> 01:35:12.84
PMS in or I'm whatever.

2206
01:35:12.84 --> 01:35:15.84
It's to explain their common behavior.

2207
01:35:15.84 --> 01:35:16.84
Meaning they just let it go.

2208
01:35:16.84 --> 01:35:19.84
They embrace that's how it is for them.

2209
01:35:19.84 --> 01:35:20.84
Yeah.

2210
01:35:20.84 --> 01:35:21.84
Kind of thing.

2211
01:35:21.84 --> 01:35:22.84
Please forgive me.

2212
01:35:22.84 --> 01:35:22.84
I'm angry.

2213
01:35:22.84 --> 01:35:23.84
Yeah.

2214
01:35:23.84 --> 01:35:24.84
I get like that sometimes.

2215
01:35:24.84 --> 01:35:25.84
What are you talking about?

2216
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84
And you just let it go.

2217
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:27.84
You know, be like that on the inside.

2218
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:29.84
Be good on them.

2219
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:32.84
Separate the feelings versus behavior.

2220
01:35:32.84 --> 01:35:33.84
Next question.

2221
01:35:33.84 --> 01:35:36.84
Stifle your emotions inside.

2222
01:35:36.84 --> 01:35:40.84
You know, they say like, if you get like emotions,

2223
01:35:40.84 --> 01:35:42.84
you've got to like let it out, punch a pillow or whatever.

2224
01:35:42.84 --> 01:35:43.84
Yeah.

2225
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:44.84
I guess as it turns out, that's not true.

2226
01:35:44.84 --> 01:35:45.84
No.

2227
01:35:45.84 --> 01:35:47.84
Because if you internally know how you, you say stifle them.

2228
01:35:47.84 --> 01:35:53.84
Well, the reason I kind of say that with sarcasm is because I think that the,

2229
01:35:53.84 --> 01:35:58.84
For instance, yeah, you like you're saying people these days, they say, oh, yeah.

2230
01:35:58.84 --> 01:36:00.84
You've got to let your emotions out.

2231
01:36:00.84 --> 01:36:02.84
You've got to let your emotions out.

2232
01:36:02.84 --> 01:36:04.84
You've got to, you've got to cry cry.

2233
01:36:04.84 --> 01:36:08.84
If you, and I understand where that's coming from.

2234
01:36:08.84 --> 01:36:10.84
And you can get to a point as a person.

2235
01:36:10.84 --> 01:36:13.84
If there's something that's really traumatic that's happening.

2236
01:36:13.84 --> 01:36:14.84
And all you do is hold it in.

2237
01:36:14.84 --> 01:36:19.84
And I've seen guys get destroyed over that because they're not expressing the emotions

2238
01:36:19.84 --> 01:36:21.84
that they have.

2239
01:36:21.84 --> 01:36:26.84
But that's at a big level.

2240
01:36:26.84 --> 01:36:27.84
Right?

2241
01:36:27.84 --> 01:36:30.84
At a daily level?

2242
01:36:30.84 --> 01:36:31.84
No.

2243
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:33.84
You don't express those things.

2244
01:36:33.84 --> 01:36:35.84
You keep them in charge.

2245
01:36:35.84 --> 01:36:36.84
That's what I say.

2246
01:36:36.84 --> 01:36:37.84
Like a big kind of sarcastic.

2247
01:36:37.84 --> 01:36:39.84
But the same time, I'm a being serious.

2248
01:36:39.84 --> 01:36:40.84
Yeah.

2249
01:36:40.84 --> 01:36:44.84
You know, it just don't let your emotions out and into the world.

2250
01:36:44.84 --> 01:36:45.84
Yeah.

2251
01:36:45.84 --> 01:36:46.84
Keep them for yourself.

2252
01:36:46.84 --> 01:36:47.84
Yeah.

2253
01:36:47.84 --> 01:36:48.84
Keep them for yourself.

2254
01:36:48.84 --> 01:36:49.84
Don't share them with other people if you don't have to.

2255
01:36:49.84 --> 01:36:50.84
Yeah.

2256
01:36:50.84 --> 01:36:53.84
Now again, people are going to freak out that I'm saying this because it's very

2257
01:36:53.84 --> 01:36:57.84
emotional.

2258
01:36:57.84 --> 01:36:59.84
Because that what happens when you bury you when you've got something really traumatic that you bury then it each you apart.

2259
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:00.84
And I've talked about that.

2260
01:37:00.84 --> 01:37:05.84
I mean, talking about things that you go through in life and expressing those feelings that you have.

2261
01:37:05.84 --> 01:37:06.84
I don't that's good.

2262
01:37:06.84 --> 01:37:08.84
But what we're talking about is not that.

2263
01:37:08.84 --> 01:37:16.84
What we're talking about is daily emotions, little ups and downs, little tick marks on your Richter scale.

2264
01:37:16.84 --> 01:37:20.84
We're not talking about an 8.8 on the Richter scale.

2265
01:37:20.84 --> 01:37:21.84
Right?

2266
01:37:21.84 --> 01:37:24.84
We're talking about just like little twos.

2267
01:37:24.84 --> 01:37:25.84
Yeah.

2268
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:30.84
And when you express those twos and threes on the Richter scale out to people, you just look unstable.

2269
01:37:30.84 --> 01:37:31.84
Hangry.

2270
01:37:31.84 --> 01:37:32.84
That's a two.

2271
01:37:32.84 --> 01:37:33.84
Yeah.

2272
01:37:33.84 --> 01:37:34.84
Overall.

2273
01:37:34.84 --> 01:37:35.84
And this, I'm not a split here.

2274
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:36.84
It's or nothing.

2275
01:37:36.84 --> 01:37:39.84
But overall, it's more about dealing with your emotions.

2276
01:37:39.84 --> 01:37:40.84
Quote on quote.

2277
01:37:40.84 --> 01:37:45.84
So yeah, if you, if a good, conducive way to deal with your emotions is to let them out.

2278
01:37:45.84 --> 01:37:47.84
And there's all good different kinds of emotions.

2279
01:37:47.84 --> 01:37:50.84
Like if you're sad, if something's eating you up on the inside because of sadness or whatever.

2280
01:37:50.84 --> 01:37:57.84
And it's conducive to your recovery development, whatever, to express those emotions then yes.

2281
01:37:57.84 --> 01:38:02.84
But if you're hangry and you lose your temper on your kid, that's not going to

2282
01:38:02.84 --> 01:38:05.84
you're not dealing with your emotions correctly.

2283
01:38:05.84 --> 01:38:08.84
So in stri-fi emotions.

2284
01:38:08.84 --> 01:38:10.84
But it's not really, it is stifling them.

2285
01:38:10.84 --> 01:38:13.84
But before you stifle them, you're identifying them.

2286
01:38:13.84 --> 01:38:15.84
You're like, oh, hey, I'm hangry.

2287
01:38:15.84 --> 01:38:16.84
Okay, I identified that.

2288
01:38:16.84 --> 01:38:18.84
I'm going to separate feelings from behavior.

2289
01:38:18.84 --> 01:38:19.84
That's dealing with your emotions right there.

2290
01:38:19.84 --> 01:38:20.84
That's dealing with it.

2291
01:38:20.84 --> 01:38:29.84
It's a great point that oftentimes expressing your emotions to the world doesn't improve

2292
01:38:29.84 --> 01:38:32.84
your situation or your position at all.

2293
01:38:32.84 --> 01:38:33.84
Correct.

2294
01:38:33.84 --> 01:38:40.84
In fact, I would say that most of the time expressing your emotions to the world sets you back.

2295
01:38:40.84 --> 01:38:43.84
And that is why I vote in many cases.

2296
01:38:43.84 --> 01:38:45.84
Just trifle your emotions.

2297
01:38:45.84 --> 01:38:46.84
Keep them in.

2298
01:38:46.84 --> 01:38:49.84
Don't let other people see. You put your cards on the table.

2299
01:38:49.84 --> 01:38:50.84
Right.

2300
01:38:50.84 --> 01:38:52.84
You put your emotional cards on the table.

2301
01:38:52.84 --> 01:38:54.84
Now you can't gamble anymore.

2302
01:38:54.84 --> 01:38:55.84
You're not in the game anymore.

2303
01:38:55.84 --> 01:38:56.84
The person knows what's going on.

2304
01:38:56.84 --> 01:38:58.84
You're giving it to them.

2305
01:38:58.84 --> 01:38:59.84
You're not going to know what I'm thinking.

2306
01:38:59.84 --> 01:39:02.84
You're going to think, I'm just everything is cool with me.

2307
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:03.84
We're training you, Jitsu.

2308
01:39:03.84 --> 01:39:04.84
Right.

2309
01:39:04.84 --> 01:39:09.84
If I'm getting frustrated and I show that to you, what does that do?

2310
01:39:09.84 --> 01:39:11.84
You're getting all the stuff you just go level up.

2311
01:39:11.84 --> 01:39:13.84
You think it, oh, I got to be frustrated.

2312
01:39:13.84 --> 01:39:14.84
I can't.

2313
01:39:14.84 --> 01:39:18.84
I can't work. This is working against them. If I'm just the same face all the time, which is what I do primarily.

2314
01:39:18.84 --> 01:39:22.84
Hey, same face all the time. Just work, you know, moving the same way.

2315
01:39:22.84 --> 01:39:24.84
When you do get me, I forget what you say.

2316
01:39:24.84 --> 01:39:28.84
When you get me to react to something good, recognize the urgency.

2317
01:39:28.84 --> 01:39:29.84
Yeah, you say so.

2318
01:39:29.84 --> 01:39:32.84
I recognize a little urgency there. And I always go down.

2319
01:39:32.84 --> 01:39:34.84
I don't want to recognize.

2320
01:39:34.84 --> 01:39:36.84
I'd rather just have you just pass my garden.

2321
01:39:36.84 --> 01:39:37.84
Yours is there.

2322
01:39:37.84 --> 01:39:39.84
And me just sit there like as no big deal.

2323
01:39:39.84 --> 01:39:39.84
Yeah.

2324
01:39:39.84 --> 01:39:40.84
It's not.

2325
01:39:40.84 --> 01:39:42.84
You meant then me get all panicky.

2326
01:39:42.84 --> 01:39:43.84
Yeah.

2327
01:39:43.84 --> 01:39:45.84
Where they don't, you level up a little bit.

2328
01:39:45.84 --> 01:39:46.84
Mm-hmm.

2329
01:39:46.84 --> 01:39:48.84
And it's the same thing with life, right?

2330
01:39:48.84 --> 01:39:54.84
Every time you express these big emotions to your boss or to your team, you express these big emotions to your team.

2331
01:39:54.84 --> 01:39:56.84
They see all your cards.

2332
01:39:56.84 --> 01:39:59.84
Don't let them see all your cards.

2333
01:39:59.84 --> 01:40:01.84
Is this manipulating?

2334
01:40:01.84 --> 01:40:02.84
Kind of, right?

2335
01:40:02.84 --> 01:40:05.84
This is one of those things where people think, oh, transparency.

2336
01:40:05.84 --> 01:40:07.84
We hear a lot all the time these days.

2337
01:40:07.84 --> 01:40:08.84
Transparency.

2338
01:40:08.84 --> 01:40:09.84
You've got to be transparent.

2339
01:40:09.84 --> 01:40:10.84
No, actually you don't.

2340
01:40:10.84 --> 01:40:11.84
Yeah, no, with that.

2341
01:40:11.84 --> 01:40:13.84
You don't have to be transparent all the time.

2342
01:40:13.84 --> 01:40:14.84
Yeah.

2343
01:40:14.84 --> 01:40:15.84
You have to win the game.

2344
01:40:15.84 --> 01:40:16.84
You know what?

2345
01:40:16.84 --> 01:40:20.84
Does the football coach go out and hand his playbook to the other football team?

2346
01:40:20.84 --> 01:40:21.84
No.

2347
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:22.84
He's got to win the game.

2348
01:40:22.84 --> 01:40:23.84
Yeah, typically no.

2349
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:25.84
And that's not how you win the game.

2350
01:40:25.84 --> 01:40:28.84
So are we, you know what we're doing?

2351
01:40:28.84 --> 01:40:29.84
Playing chess.

2352
01:40:29.84 --> 01:40:30.84
It's emotional chess.

2353
01:40:30.84 --> 01:40:31.84
You're playing with other human beings.

2354
01:40:31.84 --> 01:40:32.84
You want to win.

2355
01:40:32.84 --> 01:40:34.84
Now if you're winning, so that I can take advantage of you.

2356
01:40:34.84 --> 01:40:39.84
So I can manipulate you and get something from you that you don't want to give me.

2357
01:40:39.84 --> 01:40:40.84
That's bad.

2358
01:40:40.84 --> 01:40:41.84
I'm not talking about doing that.

2359
01:40:41.84 --> 01:40:47.84
But if what I'm doing is keeping my calm so that instead of escalating an argument with you,

2360
01:40:47.84 --> 01:40:53.84
I'm getting you to see it from my perspective just by remaining calm, that's what we're talking about here.

2361
01:40:53.84 --> 01:40:57.84
You know, late told that story the other day where it, he tells the story.

2362
01:40:57.84 --> 01:40:59.84
Lot because it was hilarious story where I came in.

2363
01:40:59.84 --> 01:41:03.84
We didn't have a chance to talk to each other as he was planning this big operation.

2364
01:41:03.84 --> 01:41:06.84
And I come in 10 minutes before the operation.

2365
01:41:06.84 --> 01:41:10.84
Hey, let me see what you're doing and he kind of shows me on a map.

2366
01:41:10.84 --> 01:41:11.84
Hey, we're going to go here here and there.

2367
01:41:11.84 --> 01:41:13.84
It's like, hey, you should do this instead.

2368
01:41:13.84 --> 01:41:16.84
And he was like, do we leave it in 10 minutes?

2369
01:41:16.84 --> 01:41:18.84
And I said, man, but just think about it.

2370
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:19.84
He goes, you know what?

2371
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:20.84
Just cancel the op.

2372
01:41:20.84 --> 01:41:21.84
He was all mad.

2373
01:41:21.84 --> 01:41:22.84
Right.

2374
01:41:22.84 --> 01:41:26.84
And you know, he's like in Jocco kind of like laughed at me.

2375
01:41:26.84 --> 01:41:28.84
I didn't laugh at him like a jerk.

2376
01:41:28.84 --> 01:41:31.84
You know what I was like, hey, man, listen.

2377
01:41:31.84 --> 01:41:33.84
Just think about what I'm saying right now.

2378
01:41:33.84 --> 01:41:39.84
But that's an example. I didn't show my emotions, which was, which would be more like,

2379
01:41:39.84 --> 01:41:40.84
Dude, are you serious right now?

2380
01:41:40.84 --> 01:41:43.84
You're going to cancel an op because we have a difference of opinion.

2381
01:41:43.84 --> 01:41:45.84
Think about what you, I didn't do that.

2382
01:41:45.84 --> 01:41:47.84
I was like, hey, man, I get it.

2383
01:41:47.84 --> 01:41:48.84
Who?

2384
01:41:48.84 --> 01:41:49.84
Everyone's stressed out right now.

2385
01:41:49.84 --> 01:41:51.84
We got to leave on this thing correctly.

2386
01:41:51.84 --> 01:41:52.84
Think about what I'm saying.

2387
01:41:52.84 --> 01:41:53.84
They'll look at this.

2388
01:41:53.84 --> 01:41:54.84
This is all I'm saying.

2389
01:41:54.84 --> 01:41:55.84
We could execute this in a better way.

2390
01:41:55.84 --> 01:41:57.84
So that's what I'm talking about.

2391
01:41:57.84 --> 01:41:59.84
Does that make me manipulative?

2392
01:41:59.84 --> 01:42:01.84
No, it doesn't make me manipulative.

2393
01:42:01.84 --> 01:42:04.84
It makes us as a team do a better job.

2394
01:42:04.84 --> 01:42:06.84
And as soon as life saw that, he was like,

2395
01:42:06.84 --> 01:42:08.84
D.S. collated himself. He was good to go.

2396
01:42:08.84 --> 01:42:09.84
We move on.

2397
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:09.84
Yeah.

2398
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:11.84
So that's what I'm talking about.

2399
01:42:11.84 --> 01:42:14.84
Strikeful your emotions at all times.

2400
01:42:14.84 --> 01:42:19.84
You know, and just to address that, though, for real,

2401
01:42:19.84 --> 01:42:24.84
when you do see the big emotional, impactful things in someone's life,

2402
01:42:24.84 --> 01:42:29.84
and they don't express them that absolutely is bad.

2403
01:42:29.84 --> 01:42:32.84
The way you see this a lot is with kids.

2404
01:42:32.84 --> 01:42:35.84
You know, kids, teens, where they, they,

2405
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:37.84
they're something bothering them,

2406
01:42:37.84 --> 01:42:39.84
and they don't, they hold it in, hold it in.

2407
01:42:39.84 --> 01:42:40.84
Because they don't have anybody to talk to.

2408
01:42:40.84 --> 01:42:43.84
They can't talk to mom and dad, because mom and dad don't get it.

2409
01:42:43.84 --> 01:42:46.84
Their friends are the people that they're pissed off and they're pissed off at

2410
01:42:46.84 --> 01:42:48.84
anyways, so they can't tell them what's going on.

2411
01:42:48.84 --> 01:42:51.84
So they sit there and they harbor a lot of that anger.

2412
01:42:51.84 --> 01:42:53.84
And that can be, that can be very problematic.

2413
01:42:53.84 --> 01:42:56.84
And it goes through all through, you know, adults as well.

2414
01:42:56.84 --> 01:43:00.84
And, and, you know, at work, sometimes people,

2415
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:02.84
well, they got problems at home.

2416
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:05.84
So they can't talk to their wife, because that's what the problem was.

2417
01:43:05.84 --> 01:43:07.84
They can't talk to their husband, because that's the source of the problem.

2418
01:43:07.84 --> 01:43:10.84
But then they get to work, and they don't want to look like the person that's got problems at home.

2419
01:43:10.84 --> 01:43:11.84
So they're not going to say anything.

2420
01:43:11.84 --> 01:43:13.84
They're either, and the next thing you do, what are they doing?

2421
01:43:13.84 --> 01:43:14.84
They're trying to escape those problems.

2422
01:43:14.84 --> 01:43:15.84
How are they doing it?

2423
01:43:15.84 --> 01:43:18.84
Instead of letting those problems out and talking to somebody about them,

2424
01:43:18.84 --> 01:43:21.84
they're having to, you know, having a drink in the afternoon,

2425
01:43:21.84 --> 01:43:25.84
getting on the alcohol, whatever they're doing, something that's negative.

2426
01:43:25.84 --> 01:43:26.84
And they're not moving forward at all.

2427
01:43:26.84 --> 01:43:32.84
So those are not the kind of feelings that in emotions that you want to subdue or stifle.

2428
01:43:32.84 --> 01:43:36.84
But these little ones and twos and threes on the Richter scale,

2429
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:39.84
being hungry, get, get, get control of those things.

2430
01:43:39.84 --> 01:43:44.84
Yeah, stifling certain emotions, ones and twos is a good way to deal with them,

2431
01:43:44.84 --> 01:43:47.84
because one of these, because they're usually respond to any emotions.

2432
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:48.84
Yeah, I know.

2433
01:43:48.84 --> 01:43:53.84
And they'll, and they'll, they don't have the power to sustain.

2434
01:43:53.84 --> 01:43:55.84
Yeah, they're just going to put their there.

2435
01:43:55.84 --> 01:43:56.84
And then they just fade away.

2436
01:43:56.84 --> 01:43:57.84
And that's cool.

2437
01:43:57.84 --> 01:43:58.84
That's why.

2438
01:43:58.84 --> 01:43:59.84
Yes.

2439
01:43:59.84 --> 01:44:02.84
And then over time, now you're good at dealing with them in that way.

2440
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:07.84
When you get angry and you've been for one year, you've been dealing with it by just ignoring it.

2441
01:44:07.84 --> 01:44:10.84
You know, in regards to behavior, just not acting on it.

2442
01:44:10.84 --> 01:44:11.84
Now you're good at doing that.

2443
01:44:11.84 --> 01:44:12.84
Not automatic.

2444
01:44:12.84 --> 01:44:15.84
Now you don't get, you don't act angry anymore.

2445
01:44:15.84 --> 01:44:16.84
That's right.

2446
01:44:16.84 --> 01:44:18.84
That's right.

2447
01:44:18.84 --> 01:44:19.84
Okay.

2448
01:44:19.84 --> 01:44:21.84
This is part question, part opinion.

2449
01:44:21.84 --> 01:44:30.84
And podcasts 13, you stated effectively, not explicitly, that jiu-jitsu is the martial art that takes the most time to become proficient.

2450
01:44:30.84 --> 01:44:31.84
I disagree.

2451
01:44:31.84 --> 01:44:32.84
And here's why.

2452
01:44:32.84 --> 01:44:39.84
As a wrestler, I've been able to pick up jiu-jitsu in a matter of about two months to the point where I can submit a blue belt here and there.

2453
01:44:39.84 --> 01:44:44.84
I mostly control purple belt, possibly there is white skill range along the belt switch.

2454
01:44:44.84 --> 01:44:47.84
I only roll with lower level players.

2455
01:44:47.84 --> 01:44:55.84
I might just be a bad teacher, but I've not had as much success teaching jiu-jitsu guys to wrestle.

2456
01:44:55.84 --> 01:45:03.84
After the same amount of time, after the same amount of time, there may be a low high school wrestling level.

2457
01:45:03.84 --> 01:45:10.84
I found it extremely difficult to teach jiu-jitsu players to shoot penetrate with their hips or effectively use their hips to defend us or scramble.

2458
01:45:10.84 --> 01:45:15.84
Possibly my sample size is too small to form an accurate opinion.

2459
01:45:15.84 --> 01:45:17.84
But I'm curious of your thoughts on the topic.

2460
01:45:17.84 --> 01:45:19.84
Thanks, lovely listening, right?

2461
01:45:19.84 --> 01:45:31.84
So, yeah, I guess when I said that, I should have said grappling in general, which is definitely harder to achieve a basic level of competence in rather than striking.

2462
01:45:31.84 --> 01:45:33.84
Now don't get me wrong.

2463
01:45:33.84 --> 01:45:35.84
You take a skilled boxer.

2464
01:45:35.84 --> 01:45:38.84
They will destroy an unskilled boxer.

2465
01:45:38.84 --> 01:45:40.84
You take a skilled moi-tai guy.

2466
01:45:40.84 --> 01:45:43.84
They will destroy an unskilled moi-tai guy.

2467
01:45:43.84 --> 01:45:46.84
You've changed a good moi-tai people before.

2468
01:45:46.84 --> 01:45:52.84
The first person that I ever did that with was a skilled moi-tai legit skilled moi-tai.

2469
01:45:52.84 --> 01:45:55.84
It was like a black belt versus a white belt.

2470
01:45:55.84 --> 01:46:01.84
I would think about throwing a kick at him and he would check it.

2471
01:46:01.84 --> 01:46:06.84
And then he would throw a kick at me before I even knew what was happening.

2472
01:46:06.84 --> 01:46:07.84
There are that much better.

2473
01:46:07.84 --> 01:46:08.84
They can see your hips.

2474
01:46:08.84 --> 01:46:09.84
They move to the same thing with boxing.

2475
01:46:09.84 --> 01:46:12.84
If you go against a good boxer, they'll jack you up in that sport.

2476
01:46:12.84 --> 01:46:13.84
Right?

2477
01:46:13.84 --> 01:46:15.84
In that sport, you will get worked.

2478
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:24.84
So, now that being said, a good wrestler is a good grappler.

2479
01:46:24.84 --> 01:46:26.84
You are a good grappler.

2480
01:46:26.84 --> 01:46:30.84
And that's why you're able to pick up digits who very quickly.

2481
01:46:30.84 --> 01:46:36.84
Because wrestling is grappling, which is due to their other differences.

2482
01:46:36.84 --> 01:46:38.84
Yes, they're absolutely our differences.

2483
01:46:38.84 --> 01:46:42.84
But it's like long-bored surfing and shortboard surfing.

2484
01:46:42.84 --> 01:46:46.84
Or baseball and softball.

2485
01:46:46.84 --> 01:46:54.84
If you played baseball in college, when you get out on the office softball team, you're a killer.

2486
01:46:54.84 --> 01:46:55.84
That's the way it is.

2487
01:46:55.84 --> 01:46:57.84
Because you played softball, you played baseball.

2488
01:46:57.84 --> 01:46:59.84
You didn't play technically softball.

2489
01:46:59.84 --> 01:47:02.84
It's the same thing with wrestling.

2490
01:47:02.84 --> 01:47:09.84
And as far as the fact that it doesn't take long to learn, if you're a high level wrestler,

2491
01:47:09.84 --> 01:47:11.84
to learn Giu Jitsu, yes, absolutely.

2492
01:47:11.84 --> 01:47:13.84
You'll learn it very quickly.

2493
01:47:13.84 --> 01:47:15.84
Look at the history that you have seen.

2494
01:47:15.84 --> 01:47:21.84
Dan Severn, Mark Coleman, Kevin Randallman, Randy Kurtzure, Tito, all those high level wrestlers.

2495
01:47:21.84 --> 01:47:22.84
And that's the history.

2496
01:47:22.84 --> 01:47:23.84
Because guess what?

2497
01:47:23.84 --> 01:47:25.84
High level wrestlers are there right now, too.

2498
01:47:25.84 --> 01:47:28.84
John Jones, DC.

2499
01:47:28.84 --> 01:47:30.84
It's wrestlers.

2500
01:47:30.84 --> 01:47:31.84
It's wrestlers.

2501
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:34.84
Now, are there other guys that come in and fill it?

2502
01:47:34.84 --> 01:47:40.84
But the, I would say the majority base is wrestling.

2503
01:47:40.84 --> 01:47:48.84
So, now, you also have to look speaking of history.

2504
01:47:48.84 --> 01:47:53.84
You have to look at the early UFC's or you go to any gym.

2505
01:47:53.84 --> 01:47:58.84
And the fact is, the fact is,

2506
01:47:58.84 --> 01:48:06.84
a Gitsu-only guy beats a wrestling-only guy in a fight nine times out of ten.

2507
01:48:06.84 --> 01:48:08.84
That's the way it is.

2508
01:48:08.84 --> 01:48:14.84
That, now, if the wrestler can learn very quickly, but if the wrestler only knows wrestling,

2509
01:48:14.84 --> 01:48:19.84
and the Gitsu guy only knows Gitsu, the Gitsu guy is going to win.

2510
01:48:19.84 --> 01:48:22.84
Simply, because the wrestler doesn't know how to finish the fight.

2511
01:48:22.84 --> 01:48:24.84
He doesn't know how to finish it.

2512
01:48:24.84 --> 01:48:27.84
He doesn't have any submission holds to finish a fight.

2513
01:48:27.84 --> 01:48:31.84
Can they occasionally, nine times, you know, one time out of ten, or whatever, get something.

2514
01:48:31.84 --> 01:48:34.84
And yes, that can happen.

2515
01:48:34.84 --> 01:48:41.84
But, and also, I'm not talking about if you take a NCAA wrestler,

2516
01:48:41.84 --> 01:48:46.84
and you put him against a white belt, or maybe even a blue belt,

2517
01:48:46.84 --> 01:48:49.84
there's a chance that the blue belt can't submit him.

2518
01:48:49.84 --> 01:48:50.84
The guy's just too strong.

2519
01:48:50.84 --> 01:48:52.84
That's if he has some awareness.

2520
01:48:52.84 --> 01:48:55.84
If he has no awareness whatsoever, he's going to get tapped out.

2521
01:48:55.84 --> 01:48:59.84
Yeah. And if you watch the early UFC's, that's exactly what happened.

2522
01:48:59.84 --> 01:49:03.84
You know, the wrestlers, they might get positioned, but they were getting choke,

2523
01:49:03.84 --> 01:49:04.84
they were getting tapped.

2524
01:49:04.84 --> 01:49:06.84
And you go to any gym right now.

2525
01:49:06.84 --> 01:49:09.84
You have a tough wrestler walking that doesn't know any Gitsu.

2526
01:49:09.84 --> 01:49:10.84
He's going to get tapped out.

2527
01:49:10.84 --> 01:49:14.84
I mean, for instance, right now at our gym,

2528
01:49:14.84 --> 01:49:19.84
we got a really good wrestler named Taylor Johnson, and I'll bring his name up

2529
01:49:19.84 --> 01:49:23.84
because I can remember it all because it's all been recent.

2530
01:49:23.84 --> 01:49:26.84
He's been training now for less than a year.

2531
01:49:26.84 --> 01:49:28.84
When he first came in, he was getting tapped out.

2532
01:49:28.84 --> 01:49:31.84
You know, that's the way it is. He's a phenomenal wrestler.

2533
01:49:31.84 --> 01:49:33.84
Two months later, he wasn't getting tapped out.

2534
01:49:33.84 --> 01:49:36.84
Six months later, he's tapping people out.

2535
01:49:36.84 --> 01:49:38.84
So that's what happens.

2536
01:49:38.84 --> 01:49:42.84
But, if you take physically kind of close people,

2537
01:49:42.84 --> 01:49:45.84
and you put pure wrestling against Pier Gitsu,

2538
01:49:45.84 --> 01:49:46.84
due to it's who's going to win.

2539
01:49:46.84 --> 01:49:50.84
Now, there's also another thing that you're probably noticing in this situation.

2540
01:49:50.84 --> 01:49:58.84
And that is that wrestling, wrestling selects for athleticism.

2541
01:49:58.84 --> 01:50:03.84
Right? Wrestling, selects for athleticism.

2542
01:50:03.84 --> 01:50:05.84
And for you to be competitive in wrestling,

2543
01:50:05.84 --> 01:50:08.84
you need to be strong, quick athletic.

2544
01:50:08.84 --> 01:50:11.84
Adgial, all those things are important.

2545
01:50:11.84 --> 01:50:16.84
And I've seen that with the school, where my kids wrestle,

2546
01:50:16.84 --> 01:50:19.84
and you see it, what it's like when you get a strong athletic kid,

2547
01:50:19.84 --> 01:50:24.84
and how they're able to execute moves better than someone that's not that good of an athlete.

2548
01:50:24.84 --> 01:50:27.84
And so wrestling does that.

2549
01:50:27.84 --> 01:50:29.84
Wrestling is selective.

2550
01:50:29.84 --> 01:50:33.84
So if you wrestled, guess what? You're a really good athlete.

2551
01:50:33.84 --> 01:50:36.84
And if you did well wrestling, or you wrestled for a long time,

2552
01:50:36.84 --> 01:50:40.84
you developed that athleticism because you had to be exposed

2553
01:50:40.84 --> 01:50:41.84
if you had to train hard.

2554
01:50:41.84 --> 01:50:47.84
So that's that. Also, blue belts, you look at a blue belt.

2555
01:50:47.84 --> 01:50:51.84
A blue belt is basically a person that's been doing you did for a year.

2556
01:50:51.84 --> 01:50:54.84
Maybe two years. Right?

2557
01:50:54.84 --> 01:51:01.84
So that's the same thing as a lower level high school wrestler.

2558
01:51:01.84 --> 01:51:05.84
Right? A low level high school wrestler is a guy that didn't start wrestling until he was a freshman year.

2559
01:51:05.84 --> 01:51:08.84
Started wrestling. Well, that's a low level high school wrestler.

2560
01:51:08.84 --> 01:51:10.84
And guess what? He's getting beat.

2561
01:51:10.84 --> 01:51:12.84
So you should be.

2562
01:51:12.84 --> 01:51:15.84
If you're a good wrestler, you should be able to,

2563
01:51:15.84 --> 01:51:19.84
once you understand the basic principles of jiu-jitsu, you should be able to beat blue belts.

2564
01:51:19.84 --> 01:51:21.84
Because they're a year into the game.

2565
01:51:21.84 --> 01:51:23.84
That's the way it is.

2566
01:51:23.84 --> 01:51:28.84
Um, yeah, you take a competitive wrestler and you go against somebody that's,

2567
01:51:28.84 --> 01:51:30.84
you know, seven years in.

2568
01:51:30.84 --> 01:51:31.84
And now they're a brown belt.

2569
01:51:31.84 --> 01:51:34.84
Well, that's a competitive high school wrestler.

2570
01:51:34.84 --> 01:51:35.84
That's a senior.

2571
01:51:35.84 --> 01:51:38.84
And he started training in six grade. That's seven eight years.

2572
01:51:38.84 --> 01:51:41.84
Let's go against a seven or eight year jiu-jitsu guy.

2573
01:51:41.84 --> 01:51:44.84
You've got, now you've got a good match.

2574
01:51:44.84 --> 01:51:47.84
And likely the jiu-jitsu guy's going to win.

2575
01:51:47.84 --> 01:51:53.84
Now again, if you take no, if you take a pure wrestler versus pure jiu-jitsu guy's going to win all day,

2576
01:51:53.84 --> 01:51:54.84
all day.

2577
01:51:54.84 --> 01:51:59.84
So, um, you know, there's no denying.

2578
01:51:59.84 --> 01:52:08.84
And like I just said, there's a reason that wrestling is the premier skill set in the UFC that predicts champions.

2579
01:52:08.84 --> 01:52:09.84
No doubt about it.

2580
01:52:09.84 --> 01:52:13.84
It is a great and incredible martial art.

2581
01:52:13.84 --> 01:52:22.84
I, I wish that that wrestling had kept its roots as catch wrestling and still had submission holds and all that,

2582
01:52:22.84 --> 01:52:24.84
because it would just completely change the game.

2583
01:52:24.84 --> 01:52:25.84
But it doesn't.

2584
01:52:25.84 --> 01:52:26.84
So you have to add them later.

2585
01:52:26.84 --> 01:52:31.84
There's also something else too where I think that I think that people in general,

2586
01:52:31.84 --> 01:52:34.84
wrestling's not for everybody, right?

2587
01:52:34.84 --> 01:52:35.84
It's a very hard sport.

2588
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.84
And I think that people avoid that grind of as far as as far as,

2589
01:52:41.84 --> 01:52:43.84
okay, you're going to get good at wrestling now.

2590
01:52:43.84 --> 01:52:44.84
How much did you do to guy now?

2591
01:52:44.84 --> 01:52:45.84
I'm going to make you good at wrestling.

2592
01:52:45.84 --> 01:52:47.84
Did you do to guys avoid the grind?

2593
01:52:47.84 --> 01:52:51.84
I shouldn't say all of them, but some often.

2594
01:52:51.84 --> 01:52:55.84
Did you do to guys avoid the grind of the takedowns and the intensity of wrestling?

2595
01:52:55.84 --> 01:52:57.84
They're not looking for that.

2596
01:52:57.84 --> 01:53:03.84
That's one of the things that makes jiu-jitsu appealing to a very broad range of people is that you can train it at a,

2597
01:53:03.84 --> 01:53:05.84
at a mellow or pace, right?

2598
01:53:05.84 --> 01:53:10.84
And that's also why if you go do jiu-jitsu tournaments,

2599
01:53:10.84 --> 01:53:16.84
wrestlers do really well in jiu-jitsu tournaments because they understand the intensity of

2600
01:53:16.84 --> 01:53:22.84
rounds of limited time of smashing someone, of going all out.

2601
01:53:22.84 --> 01:53:24.84
Did you do to guy that's been training in the gym?

2602
01:53:24.84 --> 01:53:26.84
They ain't ready for that first tournament.

2603
01:53:26.84 --> 01:53:28.84
There's no jiu-jitsu guy in the gym that goes to the first tournament and says,

2604
01:53:28.84 --> 01:53:31.84
yeah, that was just like what I thought it was going to be like, no, they're not used to that intensity.

2605
01:53:31.84 --> 01:53:33.84
They're not ready for it.

2606
01:53:33.84 --> 01:53:38.84
So, I mean, and of course not taking away from jiu-jitsu guys,

2607
01:53:38.84 --> 01:53:44.84
that train like madmen with total intensity and get after it's super hard to because those guys exist as well.

2608
01:53:44.84 --> 01:53:57.84
And also last little thing on this, there are also some wrestlers that don't adapt to the slower pace of jiu-jitsu.

2609
01:53:57.84 --> 01:54:02.84
They can't adapt to that and they don't adapt to the slower pace of MMA.

2610
01:54:02.84 --> 01:54:08.84
And so they, their whole career, they gas out and there's plenty of pro MMA fighters,

2611
01:54:08.84 --> 01:54:16.84
UFC that have come in high level wrestlers that they couldn't ever quite make the transition to MMA.

2612
01:54:16.84 --> 01:54:23.84
So, you know, bottom line, these are, these are points that I pretty much agree with that this guy made.

2613
01:54:23.84 --> 01:54:25.84
And wrestling's awesome.

2614
01:54:25.84 --> 01:54:26.84
I think it's a great base.

2615
01:54:26.84 --> 01:54:34.84
I think it's, it's a form of grappling and it complements jiu-jitsu and jiu-jitsu complements it.

2616
01:54:34.84 --> 01:54:38.84
And I wish that it was one sport, but it's not.

2617
01:54:38.84 --> 01:54:40.84
So you have to do both.

2618
01:54:40.84 --> 01:54:48.84
Yeah, and it seems like, like to, because he was originally not complaining about complaining,

2619
01:54:48.84 --> 01:54:55.84
but he, his premise was that, you know, jiu-jitsu is not in fact the hardest one to mask.

2620
01:54:55.84 --> 01:55:00.84
The hardest one to master, you know, wrestling, he's implying that wrestling is harder to to master.

2621
01:55:00.84 --> 01:55:04.84
You know, it's because he taught jiu-jitsu guys wrestling and they didn't pick it up.

2622
01:55:04.84 --> 01:55:05.84
Right.

2623
01:55:05.84 --> 01:55:06.84
That was kind of it.

2624
01:55:06.84 --> 01:55:13.84
In jiu-jitsu, you can break all kinds of wrestling rules in jiu-jitsu.

2625
01:55:13.84 --> 01:55:14.84
Yeah.

2626
01:55:14.84 --> 01:55:20.84
And, but wrestling guys, when they'll come in, if they, they have to learn to break some wrestling rules.

2627
01:55:20.84 --> 01:55:22.84
Otherwise, it's going to be their detriment.

2628
01:55:22.84 --> 01:55:23.84
Sure.

2629
01:55:23.84 --> 01:55:27.84
I have a lot of them carry over. A lot of, you know, a lot of the strength and explosive,

2630
01:55:27.84 --> 01:55:28.84
I see what you're saying.

2631
01:55:28.84 --> 01:55:34.84
But man, if a wrestler can't break the rule to go to his back, you know, because a lot of

2632
01:55:34.84 --> 01:55:38.84
wrestlers will give up their back all day, because they don't want to go on their back, you know?

2633
01:55:38.84 --> 01:55:40.84
And that's why they're going to get choked all the time.

2634
01:55:40.84 --> 01:55:44.84
But if, like Taylor, that's a good example, but he'll flopped it.

2635
01:55:44.84 --> 01:55:49.84
He broke that rule quick, and that's why he's so good, because he can expand his mind and break that rule.

2636
01:55:49.84 --> 01:55:51.84
So, but consider the jiu-jitsu guy.

2637
01:55:51.84 --> 01:55:55.84
Now, he has to learn all these, so he has to essentially, and not so much break the rule.

2638
01:55:55.84 --> 01:55:59.84
You can't, that's probably break some rules, you know, but not going to his back or whatever.

2639
01:55:59.84 --> 01:56:03.84
But, but, but, but you just look at the, don't have to break any jiu-jitsu rules necessarily.

2640
01:56:03.84 --> 01:56:05.84
So, a place, why am I going to end the point?

2641
01:56:05.84 --> 01:56:07.84
Case in point.

2642
01:56:07.84 --> 01:56:16.84
How much time and effort am I going to put into learning to take down correctly when it barely decides the match?

2643
01:56:16.84 --> 01:56:17.84
Exactly.

2644
01:56:17.84 --> 01:56:28.84
There's a mental, there's a mental gap in the desire for knowledge, because if I if you take me down,

2645
01:56:28.84 --> 01:56:31.84
cool, I'm going to get you, I'm going to, you're not going to pass my guard.

2646
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:35.84
Whereas, when a wrestler shows up, he has to learn this stuff.

2647
01:56:35.84 --> 01:56:38.84
Otherwise, he's losing, he's getting tapped out, he's getting choked.

2648
01:56:38.84 --> 01:56:40.84
So, that's a great, great point there.

2649
01:56:40.84 --> 01:56:42.84
Yeah, very true.

2650
01:56:42.84 --> 01:56:46.84
So, yeah, you don't have to, you know, and even when you say, okay,

2651
01:56:46.84 --> 01:56:51.84
jiu-jitsu should focus more on take downs, and it's really cool, and you should definitely focus on take downs.

2652
01:56:51.84 --> 01:56:53.84
You've got to learn them, and it's very important.

2653
01:56:53.84 --> 01:56:58.84
But at the back of your mind, as a jiu-jitsu guy, I'm like, just pulled out.

2654
01:56:58.84 --> 01:57:00.84
Yeah, I don't really care if you take me down, it's okay.

2655
01:57:00.84 --> 01:57:03.84
Or, and then now we're talking about, in this case, we're talking about, I'm not saying that me personally,

2656
01:57:03.84 --> 01:57:04.84
because I don't like it.

2657
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:08.84
Right, right, I'm just saying, put 10 potentially, but, and here's the thing to even add to that even.

2658
01:57:08.84 --> 01:57:13.84
If you're considering the comparison of wrestling and jiu-jitsu, take down situation.

2659
01:57:13.84 --> 01:57:17.84
Take, not all take downs are, or, quote unquote, wrestling take downs.

2660
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:22.84
I can be like, okay, I can not learn wrestling at all, and still be good at take downs.

2661
01:57:22.84 --> 01:57:26.84
If I learn jiu-jitsu, or if I, you know, if I learn something else.

2662
01:57:26.84 --> 01:57:33.84
So, again, so it goes, it's basically you're taking something really vast with a lot of easy ways to maneuver around certain techniques,

2663
01:57:33.84 --> 01:57:35.84
and still be vastly successful.

2664
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:40.84
And then you're basically saying, okay, let's take that, a person who has that approach,

2665
01:57:40.84 --> 01:57:46.84
and narrow it down to this much more difficult approach and way less effective approach.

2666
01:57:46.84 --> 01:57:49.84
Essentially, is the vastness of grappling.

2667
01:57:49.84 --> 01:57:53.84
I can still be successful in grappling without learning XYZ wrestling moves.

2668
01:57:53.84 --> 01:57:58.84
And then you want to teach them these XYZ wrestling moves, probably some that can go against you,

2669
01:57:58.84 --> 01:58:02.84
especially when it comes to energy conservation and all this other stuff.

2670
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:08.84
That's why a guy, maybe, yeah, it might be difficult to learn that,

2671
01:58:08.84 --> 01:58:11.84
but how you said there's a gap in the motivation to learn.

2672
01:58:11.84 --> 01:58:15.84
So it's difficult to want to learn, or care about learning this thing,

2673
01:58:15.84 --> 01:58:18.84
when it's going to serve me less in microplains.

2674
01:58:18.84 --> 01:58:23.84
No doubt, you can just look at the human facts of jiu-jitsu.

2675
01:58:23.84 --> 01:58:30.84
There's a reason why take downs are not emphasized very much in jiu-jitsu.

2676
01:58:30.84 --> 01:58:36.84
At a normal academy, a normal academy, they do not have the focus on take downs,

2677
01:58:36.84 --> 01:58:38.84
like wrestling.

2678
01:58:38.84 --> 01:58:42.84
Wrestling, the take down wins you, when you're the match on a micropline,

2679
01:58:42.84 --> 01:58:46.84
but that's a huge part of wrestling is getting the take downs.

2680
01:58:46.84 --> 01:58:50.84
Jiu-jitsu, it's a little tiny percentage of the match.

2681
01:58:50.84 --> 01:58:53.84
Just to give you two points, yeah, but it doesn't mean anything to me,

2682
01:58:53.84 --> 01:58:54.84
because I'm going to submit you.

2683
01:58:54.84 --> 01:58:57.84
Yeah, and just the nature of the game, you know,

2684
01:58:57.84 --> 01:59:00.84
wrestling is take down pain, there's more to it.

2685
01:59:00.84 --> 01:59:03.84
I understand, but Jiu-jitsu is just submit the guy.

2686
01:59:03.84 --> 01:59:07.84
You know, so Jiu-jitsu, in a way, it's like just get it to the ground.

2687
01:59:07.84 --> 01:59:09.84
You can win off your back, you can win from the top,

2688
01:59:09.84 --> 01:59:11.84
you can win it from the top, you can win it wrestling is not like that.

2689
01:59:11.84 --> 01:59:16.84
Yeah, I mean, people literally pull guard and then win from their back,

2690
01:59:16.84 --> 01:59:20.84
and the zero second on top, zero win the match.

2691
01:59:20.84 --> 01:59:25.84
And so the fact that you can pull guard gives you this entire out

2692
01:59:25.84 --> 01:59:30.84
to get away from doing take downs, and you can still be victorious,

2693
01:59:30.84 --> 01:59:35.84
and that goes along with these techniques that he mentioned,

2694
01:59:35.84 --> 01:59:39.84
like, you know, through, see hip, basically there's,

2695
01:59:39.84 --> 01:59:42.84
there's a lot of moves in there, there are big moves,

2696
01:59:42.84 --> 01:59:44.84
big moves, and they do help you, but like I said,

2697
01:59:44.84 --> 01:59:47.84
they're just, they're simply not necessary.

2698
01:59:47.84 --> 01:59:51.84
You know, I mean any physical move is helpful to know

2699
01:59:51.84 --> 01:59:56.84
and not a defend whether it be from offensive, or defense position,

2700
01:59:56.84 --> 01:59:59.84
but again, if you're trying to narrow it down and teach these guys

2701
01:59:59.84 --> 02:00:04.84
who their approach and their knowledge comes from the vastness of grappling,

2702
02:00:04.84 --> 02:00:07.84
and you want to narrow it down to this thing,

2703
02:00:07.84 --> 02:00:09.84
it may or may not work, you know, and it may or may not serve you,

2704
02:00:09.84 --> 02:00:12.84
it could work against you, but here, let's try to learn this,

2705
02:00:12.84 --> 02:00:14.84
real hard, yeah, you're going to have that gap in motivation.

2706
02:00:14.84 --> 02:00:17.84
Yeah, so that's actually, don't care about the take downs.

2707
02:00:17.84 --> 02:00:22.84
Yeah, and I'm going to go on record now as saying this,

2708
02:00:22.84 --> 02:00:26.84
just because, you just who doesn't focus on take downs,

2709
02:00:26.84 --> 02:00:29.84
doesn't mean that you shouldn't focus, you should learn take downs,

2710
02:00:29.84 --> 02:00:32.84
you need to know take downs from a self defense perspective,

2711
02:00:32.84 --> 02:00:37.84
from an MMA perspective, take downs wrestling, you have to do it.

2712
02:00:37.84 --> 02:00:40.84
I mean, that's why my kid's wrestle, you know,

2713
02:00:40.84 --> 02:00:44.84
it's because I didn't wrestle, and I hate that fact,

2714
02:00:44.84 --> 02:00:47.84
because I go against, like he's saying, you know,

2715
02:00:47.84 --> 02:00:49.84
I go against a good high school wrestler,

2716
02:00:49.84 --> 02:00:52.84
I it's hard for me to take him to the ground, you know,

2717
02:00:52.84 --> 02:00:54.84
you get somebody that wrestled in college,

2718
02:00:54.84 --> 02:00:56.84
I know what's, I know I'm not good.

2719
02:00:56.84 --> 02:00:59.84
Now I have developed good take down defense over the years,

2720
02:00:59.84 --> 02:01:01.84
and it's actually take down offense,

2721
02:01:01.84 --> 02:01:05.84
because I have offensive ways of defending the take down,

2722
02:01:05.84 --> 02:01:07.84
you know, I'm going to throw submissions stuff,

2723
02:01:07.84 --> 02:01:16.84
but I can't go back in time and go through the training that you get

2724
02:01:16.84 --> 02:01:20.84
when you're a high school wrestler and college wrestler,

2725
02:01:20.84 --> 02:01:22.84
I can't do that, I can't do it.

2726
02:01:22.84 --> 02:01:27.84
I mean, I just don't have the time and the motivation to do it,

2727
02:01:27.84 --> 02:01:31.84
because I'm in the same boat as, you know,

2728
02:01:31.84 --> 02:01:33.84
the guy that you're just talking about,

2729
02:01:33.84 --> 02:01:35.84
how much time am I going to focus on take downs,

2730
02:01:35.84 --> 02:01:38.84
I know I go against a college wrestler, he's taking me down.

2731
02:01:38.84 --> 02:01:40.84
I go against a good high school wrestler,

2732
02:01:40.84 --> 02:01:42.84
there's a good chance he's taking me down.

2733
02:01:42.84 --> 02:01:43.84
So how much time and effort?

2734
02:01:43.84 --> 02:01:45.84
I mean, I could spend the next five years,

2735
02:01:45.84 --> 02:01:47.84
I could go through a competitive circuit,

2736
02:01:47.84 --> 02:01:49.84
I could join the wrestling club,

2737
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:51.84
but am I going to do that right now?

2738
02:01:51.84 --> 02:01:54.84
In fact, if we're doing, I just want to get better at jujitsu.

2739
02:01:54.84 --> 02:01:58.84
And then have access to the rest of the grappling spectrum that you just talked about.

2740
02:01:58.84 --> 02:02:00.84
Well, it's an obvious choice.

2741
02:02:00.84 --> 02:02:03.84
I'm going to focus on the spectrum that has the most,

2742
02:02:03.84 --> 02:02:09.84
the most application in every situation I'm going to be in.

2743
02:02:09.84 --> 02:02:12.84
So if you get the chance,

2744
02:02:12.84 --> 02:02:14.84
wrestle, wrestles, much as you can,

2745
02:02:14.84 --> 02:02:16.84
learn your take down, to drill your take down,

2746
02:02:16.84 --> 02:02:18.84
put your kids in the wrestling.

2747
02:02:18.84 --> 02:02:20.84
Do you just do for sure, put your kids in the wrestling?

2748
02:02:20.84 --> 02:02:22.84
They don't have to worry about it then.

2749
02:02:22.84 --> 02:02:25.84
The factory mains, some people, they don't want that beef,

2750
02:02:25.84 --> 02:02:28.84
you know, where you got to go and wrestle,

2751
02:02:28.84 --> 02:02:30.84
man, that's hard.

2752
02:02:30.84 --> 02:02:33.84
And even like a wrestling, you can have a wrestling style

2753
02:02:33.84 --> 02:02:35.84
two-year jujitsu.

2754
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:39.84
But again, if you don't want that, you know who didn't wrestle?

2755
02:02:39.84 --> 02:02:41.84
Craig, Craig Baker.

2756
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:42.84
Didn't wrestle.

2757
02:02:42.84 --> 02:02:43.84
Yeah.

2758
02:02:43.84 --> 02:02:44.84
You've already tried with him?

2759
02:02:44.84 --> 02:02:46.84
You'll be like, where did you wrestle in college?

2760
02:02:46.84 --> 02:02:47.84
Which do we think it?

2761
02:02:47.84 --> 02:02:48.84
He's pure jujitsu.

2762
02:02:48.84 --> 02:02:49.84
Yeah.

2763
02:02:49.84 --> 02:02:50.84
He's a wrestling college.

2764
02:02:50.84 --> 02:02:51.84
Didn't wrestle in high school.

2765
02:02:51.84 --> 02:02:52.84
Didn't even wrestle in high school.

2766
02:02:52.84 --> 02:02:54.84
He feels like a total wrestler when you tried with him.

2767
02:02:54.84 --> 02:02:56.84
And his take-downs are great.

2768
02:02:56.84 --> 02:02:57.84
Yeah.

2769
02:02:57.84 --> 02:02:59.84
And there's some Brazilian guys that have come up,

2770
02:02:59.84 --> 02:03:02.84
that, you know, Brazilian UFC fighters that are very good wrestles,

2771
02:03:02.84 --> 02:03:04.84
that never wrestled before they have really good take-downs.

2772
02:03:04.84 --> 02:03:05.84
Yeah.

2773
02:03:05.84 --> 02:03:08.84
And, but, you know, you're going to, you're going to have to

2774
02:03:08.84 --> 02:03:10.84
wear your effort work for that.

2775
02:03:10.84 --> 02:03:12.84
And these kids that come out of high school,

2776
02:03:12.84 --> 02:03:14.84
that wrestled in high school, they got it.

2777
02:03:14.84 --> 02:03:15.84
Yeah.

2778
02:03:15.84 --> 02:03:16.84
To look good.

2779
02:03:16.84 --> 02:03:17.84
Yeah.

2780
02:03:17.84 --> 02:03:18.84
Yeah.

2781
02:03:18.84 --> 02:03:19.84
Yeah.

2782
02:03:19.84 --> 02:03:21.84
But for these guys and back to the question,

2783
02:03:21.84 --> 02:03:24.84
for these guys that he's trying to teach, and he totally says,

2784
02:03:24.84 --> 02:03:26.84
like, it could be my sample size.

2785
02:03:26.84 --> 02:03:27.84
I understand.

2786
02:03:27.84 --> 02:03:27.84
Yeah.

2787
02:03:27.84 --> 02:03:28.84
Yeah.

2788
02:03:28.84 --> 02:03:29.84
That's a good point actually.

2789
02:03:29.84 --> 02:03:30.84
But because the sample size would be big,

2790
02:03:30.84 --> 02:03:31.84
you can get guys like Craig.

2791
02:03:31.84 --> 02:03:33.84
They'll pick that stuff up real quick.

2792
02:03:33.84 --> 02:03:36.84
But, at the end of the day, when it comes to, as he put it,

2793
02:03:36.84 --> 02:03:39.84
when it comes time to shoot, penetrate with their hips or effectively

2794
02:03:39.84 --> 02:03:41.84
use their hips to defend or scramble,

2795
02:03:41.84 --> 02:03:44.84
you can omit all of those things from a jujitsu guy,

2796
02:03:44.84 --> 02:03:45.84
and he can still win.

2797
02:03:45.84 --> 02:03:46.84
Yeah.

2798
02:03:46.84 --> 02:03:47.84
And be that's a success.

2799
02:03:47.84 --> 02:03:50.84
Well, you know, so scramble, you got it.

2800
02:03:50.84 --> 02:03:51.84
Yeah.

2801
02:03:51.84 --> 02:03:54.84
But it's scramble scrambles, scrambles, a questionable one.

2802
02:03:54.84 --> 02:03:55.84
Yeah.

2803
02:03:55.84 --> 02:03:56.84
You have to be able to scramble.

2804
02:03:56.84 --> 02:03:57.84
Yeah.

2805
02:03:57.84 --> 02:04:01.84
But again, I mean, you know, we've learned that you scrambleing

2806
02:04:01.84 --> 02:04:04.84
is a very good valuable thing to have in jujitsu.

2807
02:04:04.84 --> 02:04:05.84
Yeah.

2808
02:04:05.84 --> 02:04:08.84
Much more valuable than, you know, being able to penetrate on the shot.

2809
02:04:08.84 --> 02:04:09.84
Yeah.

2810
02:04:09.84 --> 02:04:10.84
Yeah.

2811
02:04:10.84 --> 02:04:11.84
Agreed.

2812
02:04:11.84 --> 02:04:11.84
But yeah.

2813
02:04:11.84 --> 02:04:12.84
Wrestling is right.

2814
02:04:12.84 --> 02:04:14.84
That's a weird, that's such an interesting one.

2815
02:04:14.84 --> 02:04:18.84
I feel bad that I forget his name, but I wrote with him every time I see him.

2816
02:04:18.84 --> 02:04:23.84
And he's swallowing me, I give him maybe 165, maybe, and but an awesome wrestler.

2817
02:04:23.84 --> 02:04:25.84
You got to under one year.

2818
02:04:25.84 --> 02:04:28.84
And his game is wrestling, but he's like high level wrestling.

2819
02:04:28.84 --> 02:04:28.84
Yeah.

2820
02:04:28.84 --> 02:04:32.84
You know, so if I play the wrestling game, and I know I know wrestling, like I'm solid,

2821
02:04:32.84 --> 02:04:36.84
I can wrestle against good wrestlers, maybe not Taylor, but good wrestlers.

2822
02:04:36.84 --> 02:04:38.84
So I can play, and I'm bigger than him, you know.

2823
02:04:38.84 --> 02:04:42.84
So if I go and wrestle to wrestle this guy, bro, he like,

2824
02:04:42.84 --> 02:04:44.84
you're on the game on you.

2825
02:04:44.84 --> 02:04:44.84
Yeah.

2826
02:04:44.84 --> 02:04:45.84
I'll run his game.

2827
02:04:45.84 --> 02:04:50.84
But if I just slow down in my mind, be okay.

2828
02:04:50.84 --> 02:04:53.84
He's a wrestler, but let's just, yeah, let's work around the wrestling.

2829
02:04:53.84 --> 02:04:54.84
Oh, no problem.

2830
02:04:54.84 --> 02:04:54.84
Yeah.

2831
02:04:54.84 --> 02:04:55.84
You know.

2832
02:04:55.84 --> 02:04:59.84
But once he, if he can give up the wrestling rules, you know, you know,

2833
02:04:59.84 --> 02:05:04.84
he, he, he, because he has that athleticism, he switches hips, like all quick.

2834
02:05:04.84 --> 02:05:08.84
Base, just like, like he's built into the ground.

2835
02:05:08.84 --> 02:05:10.84
That's how good his base is, you know, it's, you know,

2836
02:05:10.84 --> 02:05:12.84
yeah, wrestling.

2837
02:05:12.84 --> 02:05:12.84
Yeah.

2838
02:05:12.84 --> 02:05:17.84
And I guess from a human nature perspective here, if you're going to apply this to other situations in life,

2839
02:05:17.84 --> 02:05:23.84
think about when you're trying to get people to do things, think about the motivation that they have.

2840
02:05:23.84 --> 02:05:26.84
And they're head, not motivation of like, hey, let's go.

2841
02:05:26.84 --> 02:05:33.84
But not the actual, the actual mental motivation of what they're going to gain from what you're trying to give them.

2842
02:05:33.84 --> 02:05:36.84
And do they see the reason of why it's important?

2843
02:05:36.84 --> 02:05:37.84
Yeah.

2844
02:05:37.84 --> 02:05:40.84
Oh, very. Got to apply that across the board.

2845
02:05:40.84 --> 02:05:46.84
Do you get to the life wrestling this life wrestling is like grappling grappling is like,

2846
02:05:46.84 --> 02:05:55.84
next question, hello, do you happen to have a podcast discussing loyalty to marriage that involves marriage to a service member?

2847
02:05:55.84 --> 02:06:02.84
I see many marriages, military spells where the service member has a great background in the military.

2848
02:06:02.84 --> 02:06:06.84
But lacks marriage at home.

2849
02:06:06.84 --> 02:06:11.84
You know, I actually have answered this question before and maybe not this specific,

2850
02:06:11.84 --> 02:06:16.84
but I'm going to go over it quickly just because this isn't just about military,

2851
02:06:16.84 --> 02:06:19.84
you know, relationships.

2852
02:06:19.84 --> 02:06:21.84
It's about any relationship.

2853
02:06:21.84 --> 02:06:26.84
But, you know, from a military perspective, absolutely military relationships are very hard.

2854
02:06:26.84 --> 02:06:29.84
You've got time away. You've got classified work.

2855
02:06:29.84 --> 02:06:31.84
There's a lack of understanding of what's going on at work.

2856
02:06:31.84 --> 02:06:34.84
You know, you've got lives at stake, right?

2857
02:06:34.84 --> 02:06:39.84
And with that, the job has to come first.

2858
02:06:39.84 --> 02:06:44.84
And that's a very hard thing for people to understand that the job has to come first.

2859
02:06:44.84 --> 02:06:47.84
Why does it have to come first for survival?

2860
02:06:47.84 --> 02:06:54.84
Because the harder you train, the better you know your teammates, the better shot you are.

2861
02:06:54.84 --> 02:06:59.84
The better your chance for actual survival in a combat situation.

2862
02:06:59.84 --> 02:07:04.84
So a spouse has got to understand that, right?

2863
02:07:04.84 --> 02:07:10.84
That in order for the service member to take care of the family,

2864
02:07:10.84 --> 02:07:21.84
the service member has to do his utmost to prepare himself and his team for war.

2865
02:07:21.84 --> 02:07:23.84
The number one priority.

2866
02:07:23.84 --> 02:07:28.84
Now, what the spouse has to understand is that this doesn't mean that

2867
02:07:28.84 --> 02:07:32.84
he wants to spend time away from his family.

2868
02:07:32.84 --> 02:07:38.84
He doesn't want to prioritize his team over his family.

2869
02:07:38.84 --> 02:07:40.84
He doesn't want to miss the recital.

2870
02:07:40.84 --> 02:07:42.84
He doesn't want to miss the ball game.

2871
02:07:42.84 --> 02:07:45.84
He doesn't want to miss the teachers conference.

2872
02:07:45.84 --> 02:07:47.84
But he has to.

2873
02:07:47.84 --> 02:07:49.84
He has to.

2874
02:07:49.84 --> 02:07:56.84
So spouse, don't be mad when he makes that priority.

2875
02:07:56.84 --> 02:08:02.84
Accept and understand that the family is the number one priority.

2876
02:08:02.84 --> 02:08:05.84
It is the number one priority.

2877
02:08:05.84 --> 02:08:12.84
But in order to be there for the family, he's got to prepare for war.

2878
02:08:12.84 --> 02:08:16.84
So that he can come home to his family after deployment.

2879
02:08:16.84 --> 02:08:23.84
Now, this, this obviously also applies to police,

2880
02:08:23.84 --> 02:08:26.84
the supplies to firefighters and I'll tell you what.

2881
02:08:26.84 --> 02:08:29.84
It applies really to the breadwinner.

2882
02:08:29.84 --> 02:08:32.84
Man or wife.

2883
02:08:32.84 --> 02:08:35.84
Husband or wife in any walk alive, right?

2884
02:08:35.84 --> 02:08:38.84
If you're the breadwinner for the family,

2885
02:08:38.84 --> 02:08:40.84
you've, that's what you're doing.

2886
02:08:40.84 --> 02:08:51.84
The way that you're taking care of the family is by bringing home money so that there is food and housing and clothing and a secure future.

2887
02:08:51.84 --> 02:08:54.84
That's what you're doing.

2888
02:08:54.84 --> 02:09:00.84
And so the spouse in these situations has to understand that the hard work,

2889
02:09:00.84 --> 02:09:12.84
the hard work and the hours and the days and the weeks that are taken away from the family is actually done to provide for the family, right?

2890
02:09:12.84 --> 02:09:16.84
So that's the, the key piece that that people have to understand that that the, that the,

2891
02:09:16.84 --> 02:09:20.84
the spouse has to understand.

2892
02:09:20.84 --> 02:09:29.84
Now, the service member and again, I've talked about this before the service member or the firefighter or the police officer or the breadwinner.

2893
02:09:29.84 --> 02:09:35.84
What they have to do is they have to make sure that they don't go overboard.

2894
02:09:35.84 --> 02:09:40.84
That they draw the line somewhere that they don't destroy.

2895
02:09:40.84 --> 02:09:42.84
What it is that you're trying to protect.

2896
02:09:42.84 --> 02:09:44.84
Don't destroy what it is you're trying to take care of.

2897
02:09:44.84 --> 02:09:49.84
Don't give the, the plant so much water that you drown it.

2898
02:09:49.84 --> 02:09:53.84
Don't cook the steak so long that you burn it.

2899
02:09:53.84 --> 02:10:00.84
Don't work so hard for your family that you don't have a family anymore.

2900
02:10:00.84 --> 02:10:05.84
You gotta have the balance.

2901
02:10:05.84 --> 02:10:15.84
In one of the things that you gotta do is you gotta explain that to the family and you gotta tell them what's up and you gotta tell them that they are the most important thing.

2902
02:10:15.84 --> 02:10:22.84
And that all this work that you're doing that's taken you away from them is actually being done for them.

2903
02:10:22.84 --> 02:10:27.84
And you gotta communicate that to them. They got to understand it's hard for them. It's hard for them. It's hard for them. It's hard for a,

2904
02:10:27.84 --> 02:10:36.84
8 year old kid to understand why you're missing the, the baseball game or the, the six year old girl while you're missing the, the jitz who turn them in or whatever.

2905
02:10:36.84 --> 02:10:38.84
It's hard to explain that.

2906
02:10:38.84 --> 02:10:44.84
But you've got to at least try you've got to make it evident them and you also have to make sure you don't abuse it.

2907
02:10:44.84 --> 02:10:49.84
Right? Because work can be fun.

2908
02:10:49.84 --> 02:10:59.84
And hanging out with our teammates for an extra day of shooting or an extra day of jumping or having a beer at the pub on the way home.

2909
02:10:59.84 --> 02:11:03.84
That can all sometimes be more appealing than the recital.

2910
02:11:03.84 --> 02:11:05.84
Then the ball game.

2911
02:11:05.84 --> 02:11:08.84
So don't abuse it.

2912
02:11:08.84 --> 02:11:11.84
You, you have to take care of your family.

2913
02:11:11.84 --> 02:11:19.84
And you have to talk to each other and understand this balance together.

2914
02:11:19.84 --> 02:11:38.84
Understand the sacrifices that are being made on both sides so that you can work it out and maintain the strength of that entity, the family that you're trying to take care of.

2915
02:11:38.84 --> 02:11:43.84
Yeah, and I mean, I walked the line on this one. I work hard and I work hard for my whole life.

2916
02:11:43.84 --> 02:11:53.84
Yeah, and it's going to depend to, right? I mean, like, you say don't work so hard that you don't have a, it depends how rigid or resilient like the family is.

2917
02:11:53.84 --> 02:11:58.84
And that has to do with like, you know, you explain it and it's kind of like lifting and overtraining.

2918
02:11:58.84 --> 02:12:01.84
Yeah, I'm lifting so I can get these results when I rest or all this stuff, right?

2919
02:12:01.84 --> 02:12:07.84
But if I'm just living with lifting no less than, but it's going to depend on how strong I am to begin with kind of things.

2920
02:12:07.84 --> 02:12:10.84
So I mean, yeah, man, it makes sense.

2921
02:12:10.84 --> 02:12:12.84
You know, it's helpful.

2922
02:12:12.84 --> 02:12:15.84
I mean, you've got to explain it till like how you say with everything.

2923
02:12:15.84 --> 02:12:16.84
Yeah, just keep explaining.

2924
02:12:16.84 --> 02:12:22.84
But my daughter, yesterday last night asked me why she wasn't sad or nothing like that, but she's like, why do you work so much?

2925
02:12:22.84 --> 02:12:28.84
I think it's, I mean, it's face. I don't work so much, but as far as she's concerned, if I'm not playing, whether at that moment or you work to my, I can work one minute.

2926
02:12:28.84 --> 02:12:31.84
I work too much, but I was like, oh, dang.

2927
02:12:31.84 --> 02:12:36.84
I had to think of it from her perspective, you know, and I had explained it.

2928
02:12:36.84 --> 02:12:40.84
I explained it all and she had fun. Me explained it. You know, and now she understands.

2929
02:12:40.84 --> 02:12:45.84
I had, you know, I was like sitting having to dinner with my, with my family.

2930
02:12:45.84 --> 02:12:50.84
You know, and we don't eat together every single night because we're all busy doing a bunch of different things.

2931
02:12:50.84 --> 02:12:57.84
So we were having dinner and for some reason I had something going on to business where I was pulled out my phone and I was texting someone going back and forth.

2932
02:12:57.84 --> 02:13:03.84
And you know, one of my kids was, you know, why you on your phone right now?

2933
02:13:03.84 --> 02:13:08.84
And then you know, my like, wife chimed in, yeah, I can't you just put that down.

2934
02:13:08.84 --> 02:13:13.84
And I said, hey, just so everybody knows, did you get the fence?

2935
02:13:13.84 --> 02:13:27.84
I did get a little bit of fence. I said, just so everybody knows, if I could, I would take this phone and throw it in the ocean and never look at it again.

2936
02:13:27.84 --> 02:13:41.84
But I have work to do and sometimes my work involves working at night and some, and most of the time, we're from working at night, it's on this little gadget right here that I have to look at.

2937
02:13:41.84 --> 02:13:48.84
So that's why I'm doing this. Not because I don't want to listen to you, not because I don't want to sit here and just focus on the family right now.

2938
02:13:48.84 --> 02:13:53.84
But guess what, I got work to do and the work that I'm doing is not for me.

2939
02:13:53.84 --> 02:13:59.84
It's for this family. So we can have a house so we can have food on the table.

2940
02:13:59.84 --> 02:14:02.84
So back off.

2941
02:14:02.84 --> 02:14:05.84
But they got the point. You know what I mean? Yeah, really.

2942
02:14:05.84 --> 02:14:13.84
The back off point. But they understand, they realize, you know, and for, you know, for my, for my young daughter that was, you know, five years old at the time, I said,

2943
02:14:13.84 --> 02:14:23.84
I said, this is how we get food and this is how you get toys. I have to work to buy you toys. Yeah, you know, do you not want any more toys?

2944
02:14:23.84 --> 02:14:26.84
She was like, hmm, go ahead and answer the phone.

2945
02:14:26.84 --> 02:14:28.84
Yeah, did you work?

2946
02:14:28.84 --> 02:14:35.84
Yeah, that's what you have toys. That was part of my speech, too. There you go. That wasn't all that stuff.

2947
02:14:35.84 --> 02:14:44.84
Did it get nuts like I did? It wasn't very confrontational. She used like smiling. She's just a good cop. Keep in mind when I'm working. She has the option to jump on my lap.

2948
02:14:44.84 --> 02:14:48.84
Right. Keep that in mind. So it's, this is in a troublesome situation.

2949
02:14:48.84 --> 02:14:53.84
Yeah. And I understand that. But the point still is there, though. You explain it.

2950
02:14:53.84 --> 02:15:02.84
Like you explained it or like how I explained it. And if they know and they understand, then it's like it's clear, you know, but not, that's not to say that they don't have a point, though.

2951
02:15:02.84 --> 02:15:08.84
Because sometimes, especially if you don't explain or you're not engaged at all these people who, you know, they're in the phone yourself.

2952
02:15:08.84 --> 02:15:12.84
And that's why you need to check yourself and make sure that you're not going overboard.

2953
02:15:12.84 --> 02:15:14.84
Yeah, you're not abusing it. Because you know what?

2954
02:15:14.84 --> 02:15:19.84
Does that client really need to hear from me at this moment?

2955
02:15:19.84 --> 02:15:20.84
Yes.

2956
02:15:20.84 --> 02:15:25.84
The answer is, and this is, you know, I figured out years later, it's like no, actually they don't need to hear from me right now.

2957
02:15:25.84 --> 02:15:26.84
Yeah.

2958
02:15:26.84 --> 02:15:27.84
Not a little time. Sometimes.

2959
02:15:27.84 --> 02:15:28.84
Sometimes.

2960
02:15:28.84 --> 02:15:29.84
But they can hear from me a little later.

2961
02:15:29.84 --> 02:15:30.84
Yeah.

2962
02:15:30.84 --> 02:15:31.84
After dinner.

2963
02:15:31.84 --> 02:15:35.84
When I text you right back, you have to respond right back.

2964
02:15:35.84 --> 02:15:36.84
Yeah.

2965
02:15:36.84 --> 02:15:38.84
No, you have to respond right back.

2966
02:15:38.84 --> 02:15:40.84
Sometimes I'm busy cruising.

2967
02:15:40.84 --> 02:15:43.84
We got a grown morning sick.

2968
02:15:43.84 --> 02:15:45.84
No, we don't. But we're going to do that anyway.

2969
02:15:45.84 --> 02:15:47.84
Jockel.

2970
02:15:47.84 --> 02:15:49.84
Do you have a specific place or time?

2971
02:15:49.84 --> 02:15:53.84
You spend thinking specifically about your fallen comrades.

2972
02:15:53.84 --> 02:16:03.84
Yeah.

2973
02:16:03.84 --> 02:16:09.84
Anytime that things are going.

2974
02:16:09.84 --> 02:16:11.84
Good.

2975
02:16:11.84 --> 02:16:12.84
In my life.

2976
02:16:12.84 --> 02:16:15.84
Any moment of happiness.

2977
02:16:15.84 --> 02:16:22.84
Anytime I'm enjoying my life from thinking about.

2978
02:16:22.84 --> 02:16:29.84
What the future holds.

2979
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:40.84
That's when I think about my friends that died.

2980
02:16:40.84 --> 02:16:48.84
So surfing after a good wave and waiting for the next one.

2981
02:16:48.84 --> 02:16:52.84
After some good jiu-jitsu training.

2982
02:16:52.84 --> 02:16:55.84
After a good workout.

2983
02:16:55.84 --> 02:16:57.84
A good meal.

2984
02:16:57.84 --> 02:17:02.84
Or maybe a smile.

2985
02:17:02.84 --> 02:17:04.84
Or a laugh with a friend.

2986
02:17:04.84 --> 02:17:09.84
Or having an ice cream cone with my.

2987
02:17:09.84 --> 02:17:12.84
With my daughter.

2988
02:17:12.84 --> 02:17:17.84
Or playing guitar with my son or catching a little smile.

2989
02:17:17.84 --> 02:17:23.84
And I'm a wife.

2990
02:17:23.84 --> 02:17:27.84
At those moments.

2991
02:17:27.84 --> 02:17:32.84
At those moments without a doubt.

2992
02:17:32.84 --> 02:17:33.84
That's when I think of Mark.

2993
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:35.84
And that's when I think of Mikey.

2994
02:17:35.84 --> 02:17:39.84
And that's when I think of Ryan.

2995
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:43.84
And that's when I think of.

2996
02:17:43.84 --> 02:17:48.84
All those.

2997
02:17:48.84 --> 02:17:54.84
Those brave souls.

2998
02:17:54.84 --> 02:18:03.84
Those brave souls that have fallen.

2999
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:06.84
And I always will.

3000
02:18:06.84 --> 02:18:09.84
I always will.

3001
02:18:09.84 --> 02:18:14.84
But you know, it's not.

3002
02:18:14.84 --> 02:18:16.84
It's not a bad thing.

3003
02:18:16.84 --> 02:18:20.84
And I don't want you to think that it ruins the moment.

3004
02:18:20.84 --> 02:18:22.84
Because it doesn't.

3005
02:18:22.84 --> 02:18:25.84
It doesn't at all.

3006
02:18:25.84 --> 02:18:27.84
It doesn't.

3007
02:18:27.84 --> 02:18:34.84
Fill me with sadness or with sorrow or with pain.

3008
02:18:34.84 --> 02:18:42.84
And it doesn't make me angry or frustrated or depressed or dark.

3009
02:18:42.84 --> 02:18:46.84
And it doesn't make me focus on.

3010
02:18:46.84 --> 02:18:47.84
On.

3011
02:18:47.84 --> 02:18:53.84
On death.

3012
02:18:53.84 --> 02:18:56.84
No.

3013
02:18:56.84 --> 02:18:58.84
It.

3014
02:18:58.84 --> 02:18:59.84
It doesn't.

3015
02:18:59.84 --> 02:19:06.84
Do that at all.

3016
02:19:06.84 --> 02:19:08.84
It.

3017
02:19:08.84 --> 02:19:09.84
It makes.

3018
02:19:09.84 --> 02:19:13.84
It makes me want to live.

3019
02:19:13.84 --> 02:19:16.84
Makes me want to live more and do more.

3020
02:19:16.84 --> 02:19:21.84
It makes me want to be more.

3021
02:19:21.84 --> 02:19:22.84
To know.

3022
02:19:22.84 --> 02:19:27.84
At those moments.

3023
02:19:27.84 --> 02:19:30.84
This.

3024
02:19:30.84 --> 02:19:35.84
This life.

3025
02:19:35.84 --> 02:19:39.84
This life is a gift from those men.

3026
02:19:39.84 --> 02:19:41.84
They gave.

3027
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:42.84
This to me.

3028
02:19:42.84 --> 02:19:49.84
They gave me that moment.

3029
02:19:49.84 --> 02:19:52.84
And because.

3030
02:19:52.84 --> 02:19:54.84
They gave it to me.

3031
02:19:54.84 --> 02:19:59.84
They don't have it anymore.

3032
02:19:59.84 --> 02:20:05.84
They gave us everything they had.

3033
02:20:05.84 --> 02:20:07.84
Everything.

3034
02:20:07.84 --> 02:20:09.84
They had.

3035
02:20:09.84 --> 02:20:16.84
They gave to us.

3036
02:20:16.84 --> 02:20:19.84
So.

3037
02:20:19.84 --> 02:20:23.84
Great.

3038
02:20:23.84 --> 02:20:25.84
Great.

3039
02:20:25.84 --> 02:20:27.84
To them.

3040
02:20:27.84 --> 02:20:31.84
And when I think of them.

3041
02:20:31.84 --> 02:20:33.84
I'm not.

3042
02:20:33.84 --> 02:20:37.84
Sad.

3043
02:20:37.84 --> 02:20:39.84
When I think of them.

3044
02:20:39.84 --> 02:20:43.84
I'm happy.

3045
02:20:43.84 --> 02:20:46.84
I'm happy I knew them.

3046
02:20:46.84 --> 02:20:52.84
I'm happy I served with such heroes.

3047
02:20:52.84 --> 02:21:17.84
And I'm happy that they gave me the chance to be happy today.

3048
02:21:17.84 --> 02:21:23.84
I won't let.

3049
02:21:23.84 --> 02:21:24.84
The dark.

3050
02:21:24.84 --> 02:21:26.84
Specter of death.

3051
02:21:26.84 --> 02:21:34.84
Drag me down.

3052
02:21:34.84 --> 02:21:36.84
I'll.

3053
02:21:36.84 --> 02:21:40.84
Remember them.

3054
02:21:40.84 --> 02:21:42.84
And.

3055
02:21:42.84 --> 02:21:46.84
And for them.

3056
02:21:46.84 --> 02:21:48.84
I.

3057
02:21:48.84 --> 02:21:50.84
Will.

3058
02:21:50.84 --> 02:21:59.84
Live.

3059
02:21:59.84 --> 02:22:05.84
And I think that's.

3060
02:22:05.84 --> 02:22:06.84
All I've gotten.

3061
02:22:06.84 --> 02:22:10.84
For tonight.

Proud.

life game physical so yeah supplements whatever so mental yeah mental

3077
02:22:50.60 --> 02:23:01.56
physical emotional even new mood hmm I haven't tried that yeah I don't want a

3078
02:23:01.56 --> 02:23:07.52
new mood I like my career career yeah so I'm gonna tell me I should smoke pot

3079
02:23:07.52 --> 02:23:11.76
sure you should you should just try it you know you're out of the military now

3080
02:23:11.76 --> 02:23:16.16
you should just you know she tries some pot and I was like oh interesting

3081
02:23:16.16 --> 02:23:20.36
but like why do you think you know I should do that this will you know you won't

3082
02:23:20.36 --> 02:23:25.24
be so angry all the time then and I said I like being angry I don't think

3083
02:23:25.24 --> 02:23:31.56
I'll try your your potion which is also kind of strange even that I mean I

3084
02:23:31.56 --> 02:23:37.08
know you don't actually like being angry you're also not angry all the time that's

3085
02:23:37.08 --> 02:23:41.72
true I don't think I've seen you angry but maybe three times really

3086
02:23:41.72 --> 02:23:48.04
ever what I get angry you're angry at Dean for something okay I will

3087
02:23:48.04 --> 02:23:55.20
yeah and then something else actually so one time yeah that was it that was

3088
02:23:55.20 --> 02:24:00.52
only time like it actually was it was a Dean twice yeah Dean can be frustrating

3089
02:24:00.52 --> 02:24:06.28
hey man and if you're angry all the time there's this thing called new mood by

3090
02:24:06.28 --> 02:24:14.16
on I took it once but I didn't feel like I was in a new mood but from the

3091
02:24:14.16 --> 02:24:17.68
people that other people that take it because you know like okay so

3092
02:24:17.68 --> 02:24:20.52
something's like anything else is like you're you're probably gonna take the

3093
02:24:20.52 --> 02:24:23.88
ones that you feel like you need or you want help with you know like if you're

3094
02:24:23.88 --> 02:24:27.68
like okay I gotta recover better from it because I work out so much you're gonna

3095
02:24:27.68 --> 02:24:31.36
take some kind of recovery thing you know my joints or you know whatever you're

3096
02:24:31.36 --> 02:24:34.48
gonna take real oil or something for your joints whether so new mood is one of

3097
02:24:34.48 --> 02:24:39.12
those ones where I was like okay I'm sleeping fine I don't have necessarily like

3098
02:24:39.12 --> 02:24:44.40
hangover situations or depression or anything where I need some enhancement

3099
02:24:44.40 --> 02:24:47.20
not to say that I couldn't benefit I'm not saying that but I'm saying I'm not

3100
02:24:47.20 --> 02:24:52.24
gravitating towards the wedger it for I hear good things man okay

3101
02:24:52.24 --> 02:24:54.40
I hear good things because I'm thinking probably in the back of your mind

3102
02:24:54.40 --> 02:24:57.20
you're like you know I'm cruising right now but I could probably cruise

3103
02:24:57.20 --> 02:25:04.12
our great I knew we'd get actually no I bought it for my wife because she you know how like she's

3104
02:25:04.12 --> 02:25:09.68
the kind where she like if there's a task like let's do the task real task you know

3105
02:25:09.68 --> 02:25:13.84
oh yeah someone that likes to get stuff done yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you

3106
02:25:13.84 --> 02:25:20.24
can see why she didn't like making videos we could be in a whole new scenario

3107
02:25:20.24 --> 02:25:25.36
right now you know I want it for her so you know

3108
02:25:25.36 --> 02:25:29.76
she wouldn't be so productive I like her it goes because she said that she

3109
02:25:29.76 --> 02:25:32.88
stresses from it yeah especially with a new bay I mean kind of new six

3110
02:25:32.88 --> 02:25:36.08
seven months whatever but you know like when it's time to go sleep you know

3111
02:25:36.08 --> 02:25:38.88
okay and where and I don't know if you're like this but you know the kind where

3112
02:25:38.88 --> 02:25:43.28
me if I'm like I'm gonna go take a nap from three to four when I go in at

3113
02:25:43.28 --> 02:25:48.24

3114
02:25:48.24 --> 02:25:52.24
fifty nine at three oh one I'm probably either sleep in her close to sleep

3115
02:25:52.24 --> 02:25:55.68
you know not everyone's like that where there'll be like all the stuff was on my mind

3116
02:25:55.68 --> 02:26:00.32
because I go into taking an app and I'm like BTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTF

3117
02:26:00.32 --> 02:26:04.48
can't sleep car I can't even sleep yeah exactly so there's new mood I took an

3118
02:26:04.48 --> 02:26:09.36
app the other day though I took a like serious nap yeah I was just tired

3119
02:26:09.36 --> 02:26:15.68
like yeah tired on the couch that's kind of how it's for that yeah no couch

3120
02:26:15.68 --> 02:26:20.000
naps are are sort of I don't like the couch naps to that they're pretty

3121
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.36
dope because I think you're gonna go I'm gonna nap boom can you feed up

3122
02:26:23.36 --> 02:26:27.60
elevate set the alarm clock couch nap is just like what happened right right

3123
02:26:27.60 --> 02:26:33.84
yeah you know what's weird in a way and I'm just I guess I'm just speaking

3124
02:26:33.84 --> 02:26:36.48
of from experience I don't have any like technical reason but

3125
02:26:36.48 --> 02:26:44.24
what seems like the couch nap year in this mental state that is kind of like

3126
02:26:44.24 --> 02:26:48.08
you have low expectations comfort you know so your body's like you know what

3127
02:26:48.08 --> 02:26:51.44
you might not be the most comfortable but hey you're not moving so boom you just

3128
02:26:51.44 --> 02:26:57.36
fall see but when I when you can go like in your room and you lay down and you're

3129
02:26:57.36 --> 02:27:01.12
like way away with the temperature is just a little bit not cool and then you're like

3130
02:27:01.12 --> 02:27:04.48
okay let me adjust the temperature only wait like I hear something outside let me close the door

3131
02:27:04.48 --> 02:27:08.24
you know so it's almost like you can't sleep because the conditions are perfect

3132
02:27:08.24 --> 02:27:12.80
when you have that expectation of perfect conditions but on the couch you don't have

3133
02:27:12.80 --> 02:27:16.16
that expectation you're just like it's like if you're napping outside of the bed

3134
02:27:16.16 --> 02:27:21.36
I don't have a blanket I'll just pull this pillow over my left arm and I'd be good to go

3135
02:27:21.36 --> 02:27:26.16
exactly right so yes I'm like I'm not expecting that I mean that just has to do with

3136
02:27:26.16 --> 02:27:31.92
naps but this the new mood one that's for like if you have like stress you know but

3137
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:37.28
don't talk about it if we don't know then talk about another thing yeah wait I think we do

3138
02:27:37.28 --> 02:27:42.000
know I think the conversation went in that direction of its own like momentum okay

3139
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:49.36
well next thing you know we're talking about naps yeah I know that's so on it yeah okay

3140
02:27:49.36 --> 02:27:54.08
on it's the best supplements let's get that out of the way like straight up factually

3141
02:27:56.48 --> 02:28:00.96
brother also they have like you know where your butt proud the other day so I got some

3142
02:28:00.96 --> 02:28:05.28
more of your bars already had them whatever did it work out and I like to eat after work

3143
02:28:05.28 --> 02:28:08.88
I gotta get a certain amount of protein in there and that's really oh I'm going for counting

3144
02:28:08.88 --> 02:28:14.48
my macros nothing like that but if you only have like one small piece of half piece of chicken left

3145
02:28:14.48 --> 02:28:19.28
over from that you kind of need more my opinion I needed more so I was like but I made cool like

3146
02:28:19.28 --> 02:28:22.64
it was like this brown rice it was good but I only had like this half piece of chicken so I was like

3147
02:28:22.64 --> 02:28:27.44
should I need more meat in there looking at the fridge like nothing so I got a little bit of your

3148
02:28:27.44 --> 02:28:31.60
bar too worried where it's in chopped them up and like put it in there and like he just helped

3149
02:28:31.60 --> 02:28:38.56
it in the microwave it's actually good so it's like a buffalo meat chicken rice um come

3150
02:28:38.56 --> 02:28:43.92
cox concoxion it was good though even you're used to worry about kind of like beef jerky or like

3151
02:28:43.92 --> 02:28:50.32
it was it like soft and moist it was no it wasn't so it was still the worry about it was just

3152
02:28:50.32 --> 02:28:58.24
a warm warrior bar it worked it worked the flavor profile worked like it majestically

3153
02:28:58.24 --> 02:29:01.28
I have to give that one a run anyway worry bars if you didn't know what that is there

3154
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.52
look on it dot com it's buffalo meat and it's still gluten free by the way um anyway so the main

3155
02:29:07.52 --> 02:29:13.52
ones is what krill oil for your joints you'd be surprised how much joint degeneration we all have

3156
02:29:13.52 --> 02:29:20.64
that's what I think okay get the krill oil also you're trying to entice me in the longer conversations

3157
02:29:20.64 --> 02:29:26.08
I'm not taking the bait I don't want to know about your joint degeneration yes you do you take your mind

3158
02:29:26.08 --> 02:29:30.32
no of course you're the one who turned me on to it so you're a good degeneration

3159
02:29:30.96 --> 02:29:37.20
I gave you krill oil for joint maintenance this is okay this is where krill oil okay so this

3160
02:29:37.20 --> 02:29:43.52
the Greg Greg train back in turn asked me not yesterday not the last time I saw him for Sunday

3161
02:29:45.28 --> 02:29:50.96
I hear fish oil like what no it was one who asked it Greg was just there um

3162
02:29:50.96 --> 02:29:57.12
I'll niche yeah he said fill oh what's the difference between fish oil and krill oil because I take

3163
02:29:57.12 --> 02:30:03.12
fish oil or whatever what's the difference okay here's the difference I might get my wife's dad would say

3164
02:30:03.12 --> 02:30:07.36
that this dude grip the krill oil is better this is why krill oil the omega threes is a little

3165
02:30:07.36 --> 02:30:12.32
omega threes that's what you're going for so they both fish oil and krill omega threes so fish oil

3166
02:30:12.32 --> 02:30:19.52
attaches to you try glycerides krill oil omega threes attached here phospholipids so

3167
02:30:19.52 --> 02:30:24.24
what does that mean who cares right who cares well I just want it you know you might

3168
02:30:24.24 --> 02:30:32.16
do it so let's say your joints are a nightclub okay follow me this is a

3169
02:30:32.16 --> 02:30:36.48
perfect analogy you're joints are you're long analogy I'm gonna make sure

3170
02:30:36.48 --> 02:30:41.44
joints are you're a nightclub that's your joint right and you want the omega threes

3171
02:30:41.68 --> 02:30:48.000
to get in there right so omega threes are these your crew okay

3172
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:57.20
jocco is triglycerides echo is phospholipids okay hey jocco's cool his crew

3173
02:30:57.20 --> 02:31:00.64
though omega threes we both have omega threes with us they're attached to me we're a mean

3174
02:31:00.64 --> 02:31:05.36
you're on the guest list hey who am I gonna let in jocco and his rowdy crew

3175
02:31:06.40 --> 02:31:11.52
of omega threes they be seals they do burpees at random times they want you know

3176
02:31:12.48 --> 02:31:17.28
or echo because they're just cruising they both spend money they both all though omega threes

3177
02:31:17.28 --> 02:31:22.000
spend money they gotta be in the nightclub but which omega threes is the bounce you're

3178
02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.80
gonna let in your omega threes they'll make a threes attached to you the triglyceride

3179
02:31:28.56 --> 02:31:36.72
or to the phospholipids who's me who probably me yeah okay so anyway boom that's why the

3180
02:31:36.72 --> 02:31:44.32
crew oil gets led in better you know all 14 minutes sorry but you see him saying that's

3181
02:31:44.32 --> 02:31:48.40
basically how your body is it's like hey it's better absorption okay

3182
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:54.08
krill oil in that you know krill oil or krill oil format okay for black

3183
02:31:54.08 --> 02:31:58.08
of editor just gets better absorption there's other stuff do some antioxidant

3184
02:31:58.08 --> 02:32:02.32
that you're the first lady you know when you get the krill oil take care of your

3185
02:32:02.32 --> 02:32:08.08
joints you'd be surprised the role they play and everything that's my opinion if you're not on

3186
02:32:08.08 --> 02:32:14.64
that get on that also good way to support amazon click through what you do is you go

3187
02:32:14.64 --> 02:32:18.24
be free to your amazon shopping if you don't already be for you do your amazon shopping go

02:32:18.24 --> 02:32:24.64
through the website jocopadcast.com or jocostory which are click on the amazon link also

3189
02:32:26.48 --> 02:32:31.44
it's also called support click on support well amazon link whatever then you so you click through

3190
02:32:31.44 --> 02:32:35.28

and you know it doesn't cost you anything cost you two seconds of your time for big support

3193
02:32:47.28 --> 02:32:54.96
so it's like you know small action bigger reaction like sodium in water yeah exactly so yeah

3194
02:32:54.96 --> 02:32:58.48
so you understand now if you're if you know what happens to sodium metal when you put in water

3195
02:32:58.48 --> 02:33:03.52
that's gonna be used that's the amazon click i'm just saying i think it's important to like

3196
02:33:03.52 --> 02:33:07.12
remember that because it's that's really you do think it's important so that's don't let's

3197
02:33:07.12 --> 02:33:13.28
don't let's don't mind this every time subscribe to the podcast i didn't stitch our google play

3198
02:33:13.28 --> 02:33:20.16
all the podcast platforms and right of you review if you're in the mood that's a good

3199
02:33:20.88 --> 02:33:27.52
right of you so put the rankings if our podcast is in good ranking that's cool right

3200
02:33:27.52 --> 02:33:34.48
yeah i guess so i think so or subscribe to or and subscribe to youtube if you're into youtube

3201
02:33:34.48 --> 02:33:40.88
you watch videos you can see this podcast obviously in video format or all the excerpts that we put

3202
02:33:40.88 --> 02:33:46.16
on there you said that like there's this massive there is so there is and there's more coming

3203
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:51.12
and you know those these are good because you can share them with your friend you know if you so

3204
02:33:51.12 --> 02:33:57.68
okay so i have some technical knowledge of you so i know how to share the link and then in the

3205
02:33:57.68 --> 02:34:04.48
link that i share i can manipulate the little URL or whatever so when they click on the link it'll

3206
02:34:04.48 --> 02:34:08.64
start at a certain moment in the video right it's not hard to do you just there's a little

3207
02:34:08.64 --> 02:34:15.20
setting but anyway i can do that so if i'm so if i'm like hey lemme share jocos take on this

3208
02:34:15.20 --> 02:34:20.16
with with my friend jell or whatever then he because i think he could benefit or this is what

3209
02:34:20.16 --> 02:34:24.56
he was asking me about hey here it is i i can send him the whole podcast i just manipulate

3210
02:34:24.56 --> 02:34:31.04
the thing to the little bookmark place where he can start but if you don't you don't want to do all

3211
02:34:31.04 --> 02:34:34.88
that you can just find the excerpt that i put on the youtube channel you know they're just more

3212
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:40.56
shareable so they don't have a listen to the whole podcast to get the you know the it's a specific

3213
02:34:40.56 --> 02:34:46.08
lesson that's really cool you'd think that there would be a lot of those from your excitement about them

3214
02:34:46.08 --> 02:34:51.28
yeah it depends on what you mean by a lot but i think yeah there's some significant you know okay

3234
02:36:56.80 --> 02:37:04.000
support the podcast i dig it and thank you everyone who's supported but psychological warfare

3235
02:37:04.80 --> 02:37:11.76
that one is a support yourself situation really if you're weak this is what it is psychological

3236
02:37:11.76 --> 02:37:15.20
warfare if you don't already I know explain every time but I'm explaining it again if you're

3237
02:37:15.20 --> 02:37:20.24
feeling moments of weakness in regards to your workout or waking up early or slipping

3238
02:37:20.24 --> 02:37:25.60
on the on the whole diet program and I don't mean diet like I'm just saying eating correctly

3239
02:37:25.60 --> 02:37:31.68
and not incorrectly if you're about to slip on that you get enticed like my sister explained

3240
02:37:31.68 --> 02:37:36.48
she did with her son brings home some brownies she couldn't help but eat the brownies now she's

3241
02:37:36.48 --> 02:37:42.64
paying for it on the treadmill according to her words not like at the moment of the introduction

3242
02:37:42.64 --> 02:37:48.72
of the brownies or donuts as the case maybe you put on one of these tracks it's called sugar

3243
02:37:48.72 --> 02:37:57.68
coated lies snack time she's got a coated lies listen to jockel he'll explain to you some stuff

3244
02:37:58.72 --> 02:38:04.80
that will cause you to not slip on that plan and this goes for like I said waking up doing the

3245
02:38:04.80 --> 02:38:10.000
workout pushing yourself during the workout all this stuff getting your work to all this stuff so

3246
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.92
if you need a spot in those areas look into that it's called psychological warfare jockel

3247
02:38:15.92 --> 02:38:21.84
willing it's on iTunes good way to support yourself and by happens that supports the podcast as

3248
02:38:21.84 --> 02:38:30.96
well double whammy double gravitational thing also while you're clicking through amazon

3249
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:38.80
you can order jockel weight team you can get on amazon.com do the click through try it be careful

3250
02:38:38.80 --> 02:38:46.88
be careful when you use it but give it a try see what happens and I got a couple more

3251
02:38:47.76 --> 02:38:57.68
just reviews for amazon.com since taking it with me to the gym over ice I not only get to enjoy

3252
02:38:57.68 --> 02:39:04.96
the semi-sweet flavor of the tea but I have also noticed increases in strength on squats of

3253
02:39:04.96 --> 02:39:14.72
notice to 15 to 20% increase in strength while using it and my deadlift has gone from 475 to 805

3254
02:39:16.24 --> 02:39:20.56
extra let's see it by the way it says semi-sweet there's no sweetener in the tea it's just

3255
02:39:20.56 --> 02:39:27.04
what it is no sugar in there that would be just hypocritical and I would have to close down my life

3256
02:39:27.04 --> 02:39:34.80
yeah that'd be one another one no big deal I'm not a tea drinker but needed to sound so

3257
02:39:34.80 --> 02:39:43.28
to to kick the diet soda jockel white tea is what the reviews say I drink it iced and I love the

3258
02:39:43.28 --> 02:39:54.96
taste since drinking jockel white tea my total and free tea levels have increased I don't have the

3259
02:39:54.96 --> 02:40:00.88
labs to back up my claim but my voice is deeper my muscles are leaner energy increased

3260
02:40:00.88 --> 02:40:10.24
and my wife's favorite result is increased stamina I feel 21 again enjoy the tea and support the

3261
02:40:10.24 --> 02:40:20.24
podcast again science these are from amazon right these are peer review yeah

3262
02:40:20.24 --> 02:40:27.84
very few reputable these are reputable and that jocquinty you can get and you can write a

3263
02:40:27.84 --> 02:40:35.12
funny review like everybody else is doing a little book coming out called way the warrior kid

3264
02:40:35.12 --> 02:40:42.32
by the way it's coming out soon it's coming out May 2nd it's gonna sell out and once people read the

3265
02:40:42.32 --> 02:40:47.20
initial ones that sell out the people that got it they're gonna order more it's gonna be back ordered

3266
02:40:47.20 --> 02:40:53.12
