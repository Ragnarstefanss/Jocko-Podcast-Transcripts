[00:00:00] This is Jocoponcast number 272 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening.
[00:00:07] So when I worked with seal leaders and then on top of that, interacted with leaders from the army and from the Marine Corps,
[00:00:20] sometimes things went great and sometimes they didn't. And if there was a problem between
[00:00:31] leaders, between leaders, between people, between troops 99% of the time, when I would pull
[00:00:40] the thread on that problem, at the end of that thread would be ego. Did you find it all the time? I'd
[00:00:50] find it all the time. And when I retired from the Navy and I started working with leadership in civilian
[00:00:55] companies, no shock. I found the same thing. When leaders can't get along, when they can't find
[00:01:07] a solution, when they can't even move forward despite having a common goal. When I'm working with
[00:01:14] companies and I pull the thread on that problem, I find the same thing. I find ego. And ego test
[00:01:24] to go leaders scream and they yell and they get emotional and they would rather lose. They would
[00:01:35] rather lose than admit that they're wrong. They would actually rather die in some cases than
[00:01:41] admit that they're wrong. And if you think that that's an exaggeration, history is full of leaders,
[00:01:52] military leaders that died clinging to their plan, even in the face of their own death,
[00:02:00] or worse, the deaths of their troops. All because there you go. Now look, of course,
[00:02:12] it's a dichotomy. We know that not all ego is bad. You need ego to push you and drive you and
[00:02:19] make you on a win and that's great. But over inflated ego is the root of a vast majority of problems
[00:02:26] that people and leaders face. And as I look at the divisiveness in America right now,
[00:02:42] the people that are screaming from the extreme ends of the political spectrum, when I listen to
[00:02:51] what they're saying and why they're saying it, I try and figure out where this is coming from.
[00:02:57] When I pull the thread on all that screaming and all that anger,
[00:03:02] yes, once again, I find ego. Because if you think you're right about everything,
[00:03:15] if you think that you're right about everything, then that means everybody else is wrong.
[00:03:23] And if you think that you know everything, then that means no one else can know anything.
[00:03:32] And if your ego is so big and you think you're so smart, why would you even have to listen to
[00:03:37] anybody else? Because you already have it figured out. Why not just scream at them to shut up?
[00:03:47] And you gotta watch out, especially when if if if someone is saying something that actually
[00:03:52] makes some kind of sense in it, hurt your ego, then just scream louder.
[00:04:01] And when I look around and I see people that are screaming and not listening, that's what I see.
[00:04:07] I see ego. And sometimes it's driven by insecurity, insecurity that they think there might be wrong.
[00:04:18] And so then again, what do they do? They just scream louder. Don't let anyone else talk.
[00:04:27] Shut them up. That's what the ego does.
[00:04:31] That being said, there are people out there today, many of whom are humble.
[00:04:42] People that do listen. People that can have an interactive conversational exchange with
[00:04:48] someone else that might have opposing viewpoints. And they're confident enough in themselves to
[00:04:54] actually listen and discuss and compromise and change their minds and learn and grow and understand
[00:05:01] and empathize. And those types of people, well they make good neighbors.
[00:05:12] They make good soldiers. They make good friends. They make good human beings and they make good leaders.
[00:05:24] And I'm lucky enough to have one of those people here with us tonight. A soldier,
[00:05:31] a martial artist, a surfer, a former congresswoman, a Hawaiian,
[00:05:39] and an American. You might have figured it out. Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:05:49] Tulsi, thanks for joining us. Aloha. The last time we were together was on
[00:05:54] Joe Rogan's podcast. Yes, that was fun. When was that? I think that was some time in 2019.
[00:06:04] Were you running yet? Yeah, I was. Yeah. And it's been a wild ride. I think it's been cool for me
[00:06:17] to watch. I know it's not always been cool for you. I'm thinking like, I don't know if cool is
[00:06:22] the word I would use. It's always cool for me to look at some of that's like trying to make
[00:06:26] something happen and coming up against all kinds of obstacles and still striving forward and
[00:06:30] pushing forward. So from that perspective, it's cool. So let's kind of like, um,
[00:06:37] I always like to start from the beginning. It's kind of what I like to do. So I have a better context
[00:06:41] and understanding of where someone ends up because we know more about where they came from. Yeah.
[00:06:47] So let's talk about where you came from. How did you end up here today? It started off where
[00:06:54] American Samoa. American Samoa is where I was born. I am the boy. Did you just suddenly
[00:07:00] correct my pronunciation? My pronunciation. Samoa? Yeah. What's correct? It's, you got to,
[00:07:06] you got to elongate the A a little bit. Samoa. It's Samoa. Yeah. It's, I don't,
[00:07:13] it's just a fact. Right. I feel very comfortable speaking. I mean, obviously, I speak all the time.
[00:07:19] But words that I don't know how to say, I just do my best and move on. No. I mean,
[00:07:26] we'll cover books where I've got French words and German names and what I just run into total
[00:07:32] things that I just don't know how to say them. And so what I do is I just do my best and move on.
[00:07:36] And I think I get a certain level of forgiveness from people. Hopefully. I do get tightened up
[00:07:40] from time to time if I really make something awful. But yeah, I guess you have to,
[00:07:46] forgive me a little bit because I just kind of say what it looks like to me. But that
[00:07:51] agree and move on. No judgment whatsoever. I however would get in trouble if I
[00:07:57] did not. Yeah. We're not seeing my homeland properly. If you say Samoa, though, like Samoa
[00:08:03] or Samoa, and that's more like forgivable. That's like the proper way that's like
[00:08:09] you use the proper way. But if you don't, it's kind of like, okay, it's, it's way more forgivable
[00:08:14] with someone. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's not a major violation. It's not a violation.
[00:08:19] Yeah. No. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's only people from Samoa who say Samoa.
[00:08:25] Yes. It's pretty much. It's an insulting that I would say Samoa. Yeah. That's a good little bit.
[00:08:29] No. Okay. So we're good either way. All right. Well, and I went to Guam. There was people from
[00:08:34] Samoa there and we hung out. Most good people. All right. So you and Leather. So my mom
[00:08:42] was born in Indiana, grew up in Michigan. Dad born in Born and Samoa. My grandfather was in
[00:08:51] the Air Force. And so he was born there, but he spent the first years of his life in Hawaii.
[00:08:57] My grandfather was stationed at Hickum. And then I moved around a few other places, but ended up
[00:09:03] growing up in the Panhandle of Florida. So wait. So your grandfather was in the Air Force?
[00:09:08] Yeah. Both of my grandfather's on my mom's side. At my dad's side served served in the military.
[00:09:15] That must have been around the world, Walter. It was. Yeah. So my mom's dad served in
[00:09:22] believe he served in Europe. I don't know exactly where. And then, but for a shorter stint that
[00:09:28] he didn't spend a career in the military, but my dad's dad did spend his career in the military.
[00:09:34] At different times served. I think he was in the army for a little while. Then he was in the army
[00:09:37] air corps and then ended up in the Air Force. And so they both had completely different upbringings.
[00:09:46] You know, my mom grew up in East Grand Rapids, Michigan, which was during that time.
[00:09:51] He had very kind of well-to-do area in her school. There were no non-white people.
[00:10:00] And so, you know, she grew up. She's a cheerleader. She was this. She kind of had the all-American
[00:10:05] upbringings. So she's a white person too. She is a white person.
[00:10:10] Howlias we say in Hawaii. It's a little digression here. People say howlias a drugatory.
[00:10:17] We're of all depends on how you use it. It can go either way. That's right.
[00:10:22] And it can be referred to as an attitude. I don't care what your skin color is.
[00:10:27] It can be used to the drugatory. Or it can just be like, okay, you happen to be Caucasian and howli.
[00:10:33] But yeah. So, yes, my mom is howli based on her skin color. And yeah, my dad, Polynesian, grew up.
[00:10:43] grew up essentially in the south. And it was so stark there upbringings. And to hear both of them tell
[00:10:51] stories about it because, you know, my dad's going to elementary school. And he told me how
[00:11:00] to teach her ass as an all the kids. Okay, where are you from? And he raised his hand. He's like,
[00:11:04] I'm from Samoa. And she said, what? So Malia? He's from Africa. He's like, no, no, no, Samoa.
[00:11:11] It's, you know, and that was it. All the kids started making fun of him. He's the only kid
[00:11:15] with brown skin skin in the class. And, you know, would go out and town and get called, get called
[00:11:23] the N word, get scolded out of, you know, the men's bathroom told you got to go use the
[00:11:28] colored bathroom. You know, there's no water fountain. You got to go use the hose in the back
[00:11:33] because the water fountain is for whites only. And so as he was so confused coming from Samoa
[00:11:41] and then Hawaii. And he's like, I mean, I'm not, I'm not black. I'm like he was, it was, it was at a
[00:11:48] young age. Just kind of being confronted with racism, obviously, but also just confusion on his part.
[00:11:56] And that, that kind of was the, made a huge impact in his, in his formative years in life.
[00:12:07] And so fast forward, he's going to college in California, Mom's going to University of
[00:12:13] Michigan. They both had summer jobs at Yosemite and which is how they met.
[00:12:19] And, uh, Facebook. That was, you know what, you're that was? That would have been in the 60s.
[00:12:24] Mm-hmm. And maybe they'd no tilt. One of our frequent podcasts, guests, John Stryker
[00:12:32] Meyer, who ended up being a Green Brake, Saga and Vietnam. Before he went to army, he went out to
[00:12:39] Yosemite and work there in the summer. Is he the guy who has come with some of the Vietnamese?
[00:12:45] Yes. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. That's cool. Those are amazing. Oh my god. I love those,
[00:12:49] hear it from those guys out of this world. So they're working, so they meet, they're working
[00:12:54] out of cafe in Yosemite. Dad's checking Mom out. And, um, asked her out and she's like,
[00:13:03] okay, like, let's go, she's like, do you play tennis? He's like, yeah,
[00:13:09] he didn't play tennis at all. She's like, okay, cool. Let's go play as their first date. So they
[00:13:14] went out in the tennis court. She beat him six love, six love for the non-tenuous players. That
[00:13:20] means zero. He got zero points. But I think the keyword was actually love.
[00:13:25] Exactly. I could see where this is going. Love and what became a very healthy competition.
[00:13:33] He then later on, went and became a actual tennis pro. And they've been married now almost,
[00:13:41] I think 53 years and still played tennis almost every day together. It's awesome.
[00:13:49] But that was how that was how Mike and Carol gathered began. And the first, I think one of the,
[00:13:57] yeah, the first time he went to visit my mom and Michigan after they were, they were going
[00:14:02] out for a little while. And my mom, I think actually, I think they were going out for a little while.
[00:14:10] My mom had decided, like, she wanted to marry this guy and told my grandma.
[00:14:15] And my dad happened to be in the garage about to walk in the door and start over here this conversation
[00:14:19] inside the house. And I heard my grandmother's response to my mom saying, Carol,
[00:14:27] but he's not even white. How can you marry him? And Dad was a little taken a back
[00:14:35] and turned around and went back and got in the car and went and took a little bit of time.
[00:14:44] But it was just a reflection of the complete start differences and where they were from and,
[00:14:50] you know, their views of the world and, and obviously they fell in love with my dad and, and,
[00:14:56] it was, yeah, bringing together of two different people, two different backgrounds and,
[00:15:04] and ultimately, you know, my dad took her away from the mainland and, and to, to Somal,
[00:15:10] where they both went and, as teachers, they both got jobs as teachers there. My mom was doing
[00:15:15] shoes of speech therapists, so helping kids who had different kind of speech issues.
[00:15:20] And Dad became, I think, the assistant dean of the community college there, who's an English major.
[00:15:24] And so they, the three, there's five kids in our family and the three middle kids
[00:15:31] were all born there and then we moved to Hawaii when I was two years old, so Hawaii's been home
[00:15:37] for me ever since. Did you get to Hawaii and, I mean, what's it like when you get there,
[00:15:45] what, like, what are your memories of growing up in Hawaii? What were your formative memories?
[00:15:49] Some was one of my earliest memories, so I'm four or five, so my little sister was, is baby
[00:15:55] of the family and she was, she was born in Hawaii and, um, she, basically, she came a little sooner
[00:16:03] than expected and so my dad delivered her at home quickly and I watched that happen.
[00:16:11] That was, that was a big strong dose of reality, you know, I'm, I'm three years old at the time.
[00:16:18] Can you remember it? I have, I vaguely remember.
[00:16:22] For your PTSD. I pretty much, I don't remember, I, like, I can't visualize it, but I do remember
[00:16:29] being somewhat traumatized by it. Yeah. Well, I, and the, the, let's, the story goes that, like,
[00:16:34] my babysitter who was there also that, that after witnessing that, um, I told her like,
[00:16:40] I never, ever, what, what to do that? But, um, yeah, so, uh, we, we moved around, like, group on the island of
[00:16:50] Hawaii. What was your parents doing for work there? They were teachers, um, they were teachers there,
[00:16:57] they had started kind of a small, a small private school that we went to and then, um, and then
[00:17:04] they ended up, uh, the school had to close down for, for one reason or another, um, but then anyway,
[00:17:11] they, they ended up teaching us, we were home schooled and they ended up teaching us in a bunch of
[00:17:15] other kind of kids in the neighborhood at home. And then they, they're, they're entrepreneurs at
[00:17:20] heart. They've always been, even at back in Samoa, they were teaching, but they had, uh, Mike's 10,
[00:17:24] uh, Mike's sports shop. They had his little sports shop. And so they've always had some kind of side
[00:17:28] gig happening and always different ideas for new businesses and, and eventually they opened, um,
[00:17:33] kind of family style, Delhi, restaurant, healthy, healthy eating. Um, so they, they've done a lot of
[00:17:40] different things in their lives and, um, it's always been, uh, family, family affairs.
[00:17:49] Everything that's going on, you, did you have involvement where you make in Samoosh's down at the
[00:17:53] Delhi? I'm the one, I get to take credit for coming up with a name of the restaurant. It was called
[00:17:57] the Natural Delhi. And we, I remember us sitting around in the family living room and having a
[00:18:02] brainstorm session and we were all, we are all quite competitive. Uh, and the deal was whoever
[00:18:09] who ever comes up with the name of the restaurant gets one free dinner at the restaurant. Wow.
[00:18:14] Yeah. Apparently your competitive is an out of great progression. Exactly.
[00:18:18] I had no idea, I felt very victorious in my, my, my win. However, had no idea that we would pretty
[00:18:25] much be eating there every day. It's so, how long were you in this home school before it was
[00:18:34] cool scenario? I, um, all the way through high school. Really? Yeah. Yep. And, uh, it was so there,
[00:18:42] there's a five-year gap between me and my closest brother, the three boys are about two years apart.
[00:18:48] And then, there's, there's, there's a story that my dad loves to tell, which is that after the three
[00:18:53] boys, my mom was like, that's it. I'm done. Um, she got her tubes tied. She was seriously
[00:18:59] done. It was, she wasn't just saying it. Mm-hmm. And this is in Samoa, like way back when, where
[00:19:05] the hospital today is still probably about, you know, 20 years behind modern medicine. So,
[00:19:13] so it took my dad a few years, but he finally convinced her to have more kids. So she went to
[00:19:20] the hospital in Samoa. She's like, okay, you gotta undo what I did here and it worked. And, uh, so
[00:19:26] my sister and I came along and, and that's where there's a five-year gap between us and every birthday
[00:19:30] for me and my sister, he's like, girls. Better thank me. It wouldn't be her without me and your mom,
[00:19:38] your mom too, but what were you thinking of when you're, when you're going to high school, what
[00:19:42] do you think you're, of doing with your life? Um, I didn't have, I didn't have a specific
[00:19:49] profession, uh, in mind or career path or anything. I did understand and realize from a really
[00:19:58] young age, even before high school, that, um, I think, I think two big, two big things. Number one was
[00:20:08] that I was happiest when I was, um, when I was doing things for other people. So, you know,
[00:20:14] we'd go out and we'd do like beach cleanups and, you know, growing up in Hawaii's, I love the ocean.
[00:20:19] I literally like, I learned how to swim at all I want to beach, you know, in the, in the shore there
[00:20:26] and, um, just just loved our home and, and from a really young age, had a really, um,
[00:20:33] deep appreciation and a kind of a sense of being a protector for our home. And so, you know, we,
[00:20:38] we'd, we'd go out and, um, you know, do beach cleanups and do other things and I just, I just felt
[00:20:45] happiest when I was doing things for others when I, when I could be of service and, um,
[00:20:53] understood and realized from a young age that that's what I wanted to do and, and really in a
[00:20:58] deeper spiritual way, understanding that, um, I was happiest when being of service to God and,
[00:21:05] uh, what better way to be of service to God than to care for and to serve
[00:21:12] God's children and, and this, this planet. So, that was something that I knew in a decision I made
[00:21:18] very early on but what exactly that was looked like, how, you know, what path that would take. I had,
[00:21:22] I had no, no idea, but I also knew and I, I distinctly remember,
[00:21:28] I was probably 11 or 12 and I felt this reality that I didn't know how much time I would
[00:21:44] have in this life and that death was something that could come at any time and I knew that I, I wanted
[00:21:58] to and needed to make the most of my life and the time that I had in understanding how precious that was.
[00:22:08] Was there anything that triggered that? What did you lose? A family member? Did you see a
[00:22:13] fish die on the beach or something like that? Or was it just something that came from?
[00:22:19] I mean, it came, it came from, um, that there was no kind of external trigger.
[00:22:28] I think it really came from spending time in prayer and meditation, frankly.
[00:22:34] Because, I mean, this, this was something that, you know, God has been the center of,
[00:22:43] I mean, it's the center of my parents' marriage and it's not in a sectarian way at all,
[00:22:48] just understanding, hey, real religion is love for God and however you choose to worship at home
[00:22:53] or a church or a temple or a mosque or whatever, however you choose to develop that relationship with
[00:22:59] God that, that you're happiest, that is where you can find peace and shelter and happiness and
[00:23:08] and that, that, I think, is the foundation that allowed me at a young age to
[00:23:17] realize that truth and not in a way that like, oh my God, I'm so scared. I'm going to, like, I could
[00:23:23] die tomorrow, not, not in a fear filled way at all but rather just a sense of understanding the truth.
[00:23:34] That is not only, you know, we have no control over when our time will come and,
[00:23:42] therefore surrender that surrender to that and surrender to knowing that, hey, my life is ultimately
[00:23:51] in God's hands and also knowing that the death of this physical body does not mean the death of
[00:24:00] me, the soul within the body and therefore understanding that being free from the fear of
[00:24:11] death but understanding also how precious this life is and
[00:24:18] wanting to do my best to make sure that I didn't waste, waste it.
[00:24:27] Well, it's amazing that you and I can actually even have a conversation as to human beings
[00:24:31] because if you're talking about when you were 10 or 11 years old and you're thinking about what
[00:24:36] you were thinking about when you were 10 or 11 years old, first of all, I didn't think I could be killed
[00:24:41] and that lasted until my mid-30s, I think. And then on top of that, like, you're talking about
[00:24:48] serving people and helping people and I more than anything just wanted a machine gun.
[00:24:55] Did you, so you mentioned that that religion was part of your life? What, what,
[00:25:00] we know what religion did you get? Obviously that must have come from home because you were home
[00:25:05] schooled, so as your parents, what sort of religious view did you all have? What was it?
[00:25:13] It was, it was the, I think the deepest, trueest meaning of religion itself which is
[00:25:23] is that real religion is cultivating a loving relationship with God. And so the back drop on that,
[00:25:31] which is, I appreciate so much not having, not understanding kind of what is sectarianism
[00:25:43] as a kid growing up at all. My mom grew up in a methodist family, my dad grew up in a Catholic
[00:25:48] family, my dad went to seminary for a while, he thought he wanted to become a priest and
[00:25:54] both in their own ways and ended up coming to a point separately and then later together in
[00:26:05] wanting more than they were getting from the religious or spiritual practice that they had
[00:26:12] grown up with. And like for my dad, he told me how in the seminary when he went,
[00:26:20] as a kid he had grown up memorizing a verse, I think, or a prayer that said,
[00:26:28] something like in order to be happy, one must know love and serve God. And so as a kid, he's thinking,
[00:26:36] okay, no love and serve God. In order to love, like the first step of that is you have to know God,
[00:26:45] how can I know God so that I can love and serve Him? And he asked one of the priests at the seminary
[00:26:54] that question, like, where can I where and how can I know more about God? And the priest kind of
[00:27:04] patented him on the head and he said, you know, this is a mystery, my child, this is a mystery.
[00:27:09] And so for my dad, it was like, well, I don't like that doesn't compute. How do you love someone,
[00:27:14] if you can't know who they are? And so he, like, even as, I don't know, he was a teenager,
[00:27:20] I think at the time, that kind of planted the seed of that hunger for more knowledge and that more,
[00:27:27] you know, having the depth of that personal relationship with God. And ultimately,
[00:27:35] they both found their ways, again, through different paths to looking at, you know, Eastern,
[00:27:42] spiritual practices and meditation and found scriptures and teachings based in the Vedic
[00:27:53] scriptures, which come out of India and Hinduism. But that are also not sectarian, like you don't
[00:28:00] convert into Hinduism, you don't convert out of it. Their timeless kind of universal spiritual
[00:28:09] teachings of bhakti yoga, something called bhakti yoga and karma yoga bhakti yoga being
[00:28:17] a spiritual practice in seeking to live your life in loving service to God and karma yoga,
[00:28:24] people familiar with the word karma, which really means action and karma yoga, meaning
[00:28:31] doing your best to take actions that have a positive impact to be of service to others.
[00:28:36] And so those are the spiritual practices that I have in my life and that I was introduced to
[00:28:46] from a really young age. So it's not, it's a very long answer to your question, but it's not
[00:28:52] about, like it wasn't, like we went to bed. My mom would say the Lord's prayer and read stories
[00:28:59] about, you know, Krishna from the Bhagavad-gita. You know, we'd watch Jesus of Nazareth, like
[00:29:04] 1600 times because that was one of the few movies we were allowed to watch as kids going up. And,
[00:29:12] you know, celebrate celebrations like John Mastamy, which is which is the celebration of the
[00:29:19] appearance of Krishna in this world over 5,000 years ago and celebrate Christmas and set up
[00:29:23] the nativity scene and sing Christmas carols and there was never ever any sense of contradiction
[00:29:33] or having to choose one or the other. And we go to Mass with my grandmother when she came to town
[00:29:38] and go to, and there was no contradiction because frankly, when you get right to the heart of it,
[00:29:44] once you get past all the all of the unfortunate, like bureaucracy and divisiveness that exists too
[00:29:52] often that create conflict amongst people of different spiritual practices, you just get to the
[00:29:58] heart of it. What is it? It is about loving God and whether you call God Krishna or Al-Ala or Jehovah,
[00:30:04] God has many names. There's one God. He has many names and it doesn't matter. None of that none of
[00:30:11] none of the superficial matters if in your heart you're doing your best to love God and to serve him.
[00:30:19] And so that's that I'm grateful to have been able to realize myself from a relatively young age
[00:30:29] and knew that that is how I wanted to live my life. So how did you end up with, so you have this
[00:30:40] really kind of heavy spiritual background? What, where were you grounded to like interacting with
[00:30:47] other kids who are jerks? And it seems like you could be sort of a a little bit sheltered in this
[00:30:55] world. I could be totally wrong, but it seems like if that's the way you're raised and all of a
[00:30:58] sudden you go down to the market and someone says, you know, get out of my way, you know, you
[00:31:04] little brat or whatever, how did you, what was the, how did you interact with the rest of the
[00:31:10] world when you were in this stage of life? Yeah, you know, we weren't, we weren't sheltered to kind of
[00:31:16] closed off. We had a lot of, you know, there's a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we, you know,
[00:31:22] oftentimes like my mom was the head cook at the restaurant and so she'd go in it like two in the
[00:31:27] morning to start cooking, we'd go in with my sister and I'd go with my dad a little later on,
[00:31:30] we do school in the office with him and then spend the rest of the day, like either wiping tables
[00:31:36] or hanging out with customers and just talking story and and like that that was a little bit of a
[00:31:41] second home for us, you know, did gymnastics, did martial arts, did did all the things and, you know,
[00:31:49] there was no, there was no, I don't know, separation or anything like that. Yeah, no, so it sounds
[00:31:58] like there was balance and, and you know, working at a restaurant, that's what I should have put
[00:32:03] that together because when you're working at a restaurant, you got customers, you got people,
[00:32:06] people that are happy, people that are sad, people that are mad, people that are going to tell
[00:32:08] you to, you know, go screw yourself and that you're sandwiched suck, then people that are like,
[00:32:11] oh, this is wonderful and you get all those people. Yeah. So you learn a lot about the world and so that's
[00:32:16] a good, that's a good balance. Very much so, very much so. So sports, you just mentioned kind of like
[00:32:22] no big deal martial arts gymnastics, how into you are, how into you are, how into all of that where
[00:32:28] you? Very much so. I loved, I loved gymnastics until I started a sucks, I got really like too big,
[00:32:36] I think I started to grow. And then I, I transitioned, I was definitely more of, I, you know,
[00:32:46] tried ballet as a little girl too and me and ballet didn't jive so well. So my sister was definitely
[00:32:54] more of like the, the, the, the ballerina type and I don't know, I, I just, it's not not so much
[00:33:02] my, my flavor. So, um, I, I definitely gravitated towards martial arts and earliest did, um,
[00:33:09] Taekwondo and started learning Tai Chi and, um, uh, owing chan and, um, Filipino stick fighting,
[00:33:18] Arneis and so got got introduced to a lot of different types of martial arts and I was that kid that
[00:33:25] was told like, okay, if you want to like, toughen yourself up, you need to go across a street to the park
[00:33:31] and kick a tree trunk over and over, it's like, sweet. Awesome. I was the kid that, and maybe Echo
[00:33:40] can relate, I'd never liked wearing shoes and would purposely like we go hiking up a mountain
[00:33:46] and I'd be like, shoes, shoes are for weak people. I need to make my feet tough because I don't
[00:33:52] want howlty feet. So that was kind of me growing up and, um, and maybe, you know, having three
[00:34:00] older brothers who who had a lot of fun, um, making me and my sister do really stupid, uh,
[00:34:08] tortures a strong word, but, you know, we're called them challenges. Yeah, let's call him challenges.
[00:34:13] Challenges that really had no good outcome one way or the other for us. Other than being tough.
[00:34:20] Other than being tough. Yeah. Uh, have you been to your somebody? I have not. I forget which
[00:34:24] I get was, but, you know, my son was the same way, like no shoes ever. Uh-huh. And we liked one of
[00:34:30] the legit hikes at YoSemite. It just a day hike, but, you know, many thousands of feet
[00:34:35] of altitude and many miles of walking and he did a bare feet barefoot and people were walking
[00:34:40] by him and they're just disturbed. They're looking at me like a horse that he's like, you're
[00:34:45] tired. He did it. It was literally no factor for him. I mean, a zero factor because the kid would
[00:34:51] never wear shoes ever. So that, and, you know, the kid's got tough feet. He can sprint on just
[00:34:57] gravel. Yeah. You know, are you feet still tough? Probably not as tough just because, you know,
[00:35:03] like, have to wear like a suit and heels and all those things for work. That was an adjustment.
[00:35:10] Now your feet don't eat. I know. I have work to do.
[00:35:15] Where was this? By the way, what part of the law? Did you go?
[00:35:18] So my sister was born in Wahihuah and that's relive that, but most of my childhood was in Kalihi Valley
[00:35:27] and then later later was like a downtown. On a little, a little diverse, little, little slice of each,
[00:35:35] each of the different kind of cultures and communities on Oahu. Yeah. What year did you graduate
[00:35:41] then from high school or graduate from homeschool? That would have been like, I lend 97, I think.
[00:35:51] Okay. So you get done with high school then what, what are you doing?
[00:35:57] So I had started an environmental nonprofit.
[00:35:59] Spirituality done pay the rent. Fortunately, so I worked that out. I had, so I had started
[00:36:08] a co-founded environmental nonprofit called Healthy Hawaii Coalition. Maybe I was 16 or 17 and I was
[00:36:17] thinking about, I figured out like, okay, you know, we're going and doing beach cleanups on the weekends
[00:36:23] and every weekend we come back and there's more trash on the beach. Like how do we start to try to
[00:36:28] solve deeper problem and and came up with an idea of going and talking elementary school kids about like,
[00:36:35] hey guys, here's why you shouldn't throw your soda can and your chip bag on the beach because
[00:36:42] this is our home, this is our playground and here's what happens when you when you do that and
[00:36:48] and I came up with like a fun little skit called the Adventures of Water Woman
[00:36:54] and a friend of mine who's an artist came up with like a workbook and a coloring book for
[00:36:59] kids and I thought elementary because you know, obviously kids are starting to figure things out
[00:37:03] and yeah, so we had this, this two-day program one day was the skit and the workbook and then the
[00:37:11] next day we actually took kids out to like a field trip in like testing water and understanding like,
[00:37:16] okay, here's like clean water versus dirty water and why and how it gets contaminated,
[00:37:23] but in a very simple practical way that they could really relate to in their lives and so I was the
[00:37:28] original water woman had like the blueboard shorts and the cape with the big water drop on the back and
[00:37:35] it was so much fun. There they exist, there there may even be a video somewhere, I don't know,
[00:37:41] so it was water woman and her nemesis was oily ale and the skit was really a day in the life of
[00:37:48] oily ale and you know he'd be out there like you know throwing his trash out on the street or
[00:37:54] changing the oil in his car and then dumping the dirty oil down a storm drain, you know,
[00:37:59] dumping a bunch of pesticides and his garden and every step of the way, water woman comes in just
[00:38:05] a lick of time and saves the day and tells oily ale like if you dump your dirty car oil down
[00:38:11] the storm drain it's gonna kill all the fish in the water and you know what until the kids
[00:38:16] when you go surfing the water's gonna be really gross and it was just the coolest thing to
[00:38:22] like see all these kids sit in cross like it on the ground like you know for a second, third graders
[00:38:28] and seeing kind of like the light bulb go off in their eyes because these were examples that they could
[00:38:35] understand and relate to and that was my hope in doing this was that you know it would at least
[00:38:41] plan to seed for them to understand and appreciate their consequences to your actions and
[00:38:48] and we care very much about our home and so stop and think for a minute before you do something
[00:38:56] or if you see uncle or auntie like auntie don't throw your trash out the car window
[00:39:01] and and be able to start to make more of a you know I don't behave your all kind of change and
[00:39:08] impact to protect our home. Did you get these you know what now was your dad with your dad
[00:39:15] was in politics it's some level in Hawaii wasn't he he he and I might the first person our
[00:39:21] family who ran actually ran for office is my mom she ran for board of education. I think it was
[00:39:27] and yeah I was in 2000 okay so so the water woman that was pre-dated that yeah that's just
[00:39:36] but that's what inspired me eventually like it got to a point where and and and healthy Hawaii
[00:39:42] coalition still exists today there are other waterwoman have kind of come after me but she's still
[00:39:49] out there but it got to a point where I so I started going to community college and with the
[00:39:57] aim of working in the TV and film industry, Leeward Community College and started in the TV
[00:40:03] and film production course out there and then was going to transfer to a mainland school
[00:40:07] to be able to continue continue that kind of education but a couple of things happen my financial
[00:40:17] aid package fell through and I couldn't afford it to come to the mainland and so and then the
[00:40:23] other thing was just there there was an open seat in the state legislature where I lived and I
[00:40:32] I've you know I started to think about okay I have an opportunity here to stand on the outside
[00:40:41] and there were other things you know we they wanted to build a huge land fill over one of our
[00:40:46] biggest water aquifers and Hawaii all of our our water comes from groundwater so you know I
[00:40:52] and a whole bunch of other people we went out and got petitions and we organized and ultimately
[00:40:56] thankfully were able to get that that project cancelled but it got as far as it did because of a politician
[00:41:04] who was kind of in the pocket of the landfill company and so I started to think you know I can
[00:41:10] I can stand on the outside and hold a sign or circulate a petition or I can try to put myself in a
[00:41:17] position of influence and decision making to directly impact a lot of these environmental issues that
[00:41:23] I really cared a lot about and that's what led me to run for state house in 2002
[00:41:31] my house were you I was 21 and my dad that was the first that my dad ran for city council that
[00:41:36] same year so it was kind of it was kind of fun for us to share a few ran for city council on why and I
[00:41:42] and I was running for state house in Ever Beach and so our districts like they didn't overlap really
[00:41:48] but they were adjacent to each other but every morning it was like okay my mom would back a lunch and
[00:41:57] send him out and I went out and we were sign waving every day and knocking on doors every day for
[00:42:02] for months but that was that was both of our introduction into running for office at the same time and it
[00:42:10] was for me it was a totally it was a totally foreign experience because I had no
[00:42:16] formal education in it I was not a part of a debate team had not been trained to public speak in
[00:42:23] any way at all and on top of all of that total 100% introvert like you know I had my
[00:42:34] circle of friends growing up but I was I was so shy and I was fine with it because I just hung
[00:42:42] out with who I wanted to hang out with but anybody outside of that I would not I wouldn't talk to people
[00:42:50] I'd make my sister go out and talk to people and I'd read books and do my martial arts and yoga and just do
[00:42:57] do my thing and so to then put choose to put myself in a position where I'd have to learn how to
[00:43:05] give speeches I'd have to figure out how to pick up the phone and call total strangers which was
[00:43:10] anxiety inducing in and of itself but not only do that but ask them like hey would you like to donate
[00:43:16] to my campaign for a state house to then go like I would never forget the first day I went to go
[00:43:22] knock on doors like I knew enough about I'd done enough research to know okay if I'm going to run
[00:43:28] for this seat I'm going to run to win and in order to do that I have to convince
[00:43:33] this many people to vote for me in order to win this race so I had I had the math figured out and I had the
[00:43:39] voting list people's addresses and names and literally got on the computer made like this black and
[00:43:47] white kind of janky brochure saying this is who I am and so I had you know copies of that that I
[00:43:54] went and made at the copy shop and and I sat in my car it's like a aquacolored geometro two-door
[00:44:02] geometro on old evabito in in white pahoo and it took me about 30 minutes in the car to
[00:44:15] summon up the courage to go knock on that first door and I was terrified absolutely terrified just
[00:44:22] thinking of every scenario that could possibly go wrong but also like what are the first words
[00:44:28] that need to come out of my mouth and then what if they ask me this question what if I don't know the
[00:44:33] answer just all of these different things and and like one knocked on the first door and like just
[00:44:40] wonderful old Filipino lady answered the door and she's like hey how are you just wonderfully kind
[00:44:45] and probably offered me a glass of water and like the whole thing's like oh my god okay
[00:44:51] then went through the whole scenario all over again for the next door
[00:44:55] wholesome like every single door was was a major obstacle for me and ultimately like why put
[00:45:04] myself through this and and how did I get through it it really just it that groundedness and
[00:45:10] and the ability to step way outside of anything I was comfortable with came from
[00:45:17] that that desire to serve and knowing that ultimately keeping reminding myself ultimately like
[00:45:22] why do you care so much about yourself this is not about you if you wanted to do something for
[00:45:28] yourself you would certainly not be doing this you'd be out surfing right now and and that was
[00:45:34] that was my introduction into into elected politics sir you won did your dad win I won and he won
[00:45:44] and my mom my mom was serving she served one for your term in the board of education so for two
[00:45:49] years from 2002 to four the three of us were all like in serving in different buildings all in the
[00:45:57] same kind of you know quarter quarter mile quarter square mile area and one of those it was fun
[00:46:03] and and obviously you liked it it's on level you liked the impact that you were able to have
[00:46:11] because you you carried on with this sort of yeah it it life I never once thought
[00:46:17] you know when I won that election it was a five way democratic primary first that I had to
[00:46:24] get through and then a general election that I got through I yes I liked the impact but I never
[00:46:35] once thought that I want to have a career quote unquote career in politics I was absolutely
[00:46:41] not attached to that I thought okay hey this is something I can do now and I'll make the most of it
[00:46:46] and then you know we'll see we'll see where it goes and I ended up serving just one term
[00:46:54] there because of Iraq so when did you when did September 11 happen
[00:47:03] or where were you at the time so I was I was just starting my my campaign to run for the
[00:47:12] statehouse when that happened and at what point did you decide you wanted to enlist the National
[00:47:20] Garden Hawaii I I knew in some way when 911 happened and obviously we're in Hawaii you know we're
[00:47:33] six hours behind New York on that day so we woke up to turning on the news and it had already
[00:47:44] happened and you know I think like like everybody in our country it was it it deeply impacted me
[00:47:56] in a way that I felt almost right away that I wanted to do something to to to go after and defeat
[00:48:07] the terrorist that attacked us then I just didn't quite know exactly how to do that because I was
[00:48:15] I had already made a decision to pursue this particular path of of being able to serve Hawaii
[00:48:21] and so eventually eventually I felt that that I had learned about the National Garden what
[00:48:31] it's about and you know serve your state and it's time of need but also be ready to stand up
[00:48:36] and serve your country and and decided to enlist in early 2003 because I felt that would be
[00:48:45] a way that I could accomplish both objectives essentially did you have familiarization with the
[00:48:52] military because of your grandfather that had spent his whole career in the army and in the air force
[00:48:58] oh we you really just just through stories he passed away while I was still relatively young and and
[00:49:04] because they he and my grandmother lived in Samoa we didn't get a ton of time together
[00:49:09] um my dad had had and his high school best friend had tried to enlist to serve in Vietnam
[00:49:17] they had both gone to I guess it would have been maps or some sort of version of it and they both
[00:49:24] walked in together and went into different rooms to go through all the medical exams and stuff
[00:49:29] he wanted to be a medic and when they came out my dad had been rejected for medical reasons it may have
[00:49:38] been flat feet or something like that and he was he was totally heartbroken but his best friend
[00:49:43] came out and was enlisted and so ended up going and serving in Vietnam but there's something that my
[00:49:49] dad always wished that he had been able to do just to to be able to serve and so that was
[00:49:59] that was pretty much the most of my personal no no one else in my family might some my uncles had
[00:50:05] served but again we're in Hawaii so like we don't you know they we don't get to see him or
[00:50:08] hang out with them that much so you show up to boop you go to boop camp yeah I had I was in the
[00:50:14] state legislature at the time and so I had to I you know took the asvab and everything and recruiters
[00:50:20] like yeah you can you can have whatever job you want just tell me what you want to do and
[00:50:25] literally made the decision as like look my session has done on this date and then I got to be
[00:50:31] back by this date so find me a basic training and an AIT that can fit within these like this five
[00:50:38] month period I got to knock it all out at once and so I ended up in a like medical uh I don't
[00:50:49] operations or something like that because the AIT was only seven weeks long I had I was like
[00:50:53] I want to do like uh it was a combat journalism or something like that but you got to go to school
[00:50:57] for six months or whatever but so I shipped out right after the legislative session was done
[00:51:03] and I listed on the actually on the floor of the state house and uh I went to Fort Jackson
[00:51:08] the summer of 2003 um managed to um not get noticed by the drill sergeants for my political job
[00:51:19] until like a week seven of nine which I was pretty happy about and only got found out because
[00:51:27] um uh me and my my assigned battle buddy um we were pulling duty at like the battalion headquarters
[00:51:37] one afternoon like watching the door whatever it was and the battalion star major walked in
[00:51:45] and did what sergeant majors do like hey private how are you and where do you come from and
[00:51:53] what did you do before you join the army and you know that whole conversation and so he talked
[00:51:57] to my battle buddy first and she told him she was from the Midwest and she's like yeah so you know
[00:52:03] I was working at McDonald's and decided to join the military and this is what I want to do and
[00:52:08] he's like oh you know that's great it's great and what about you it's like oh yeah I'm from Hawaii
[00:52:14] and um I'm a state representative there and you know this is what I want to do and and he just
[00:52:20] looked at me he's like wait you said what you do what he's like how come I don't know about this
[00:52:27] he asked me that how come I don't know about this like I don't I don't know uh I you know
[00:52:34] the in-processing paperwork that says what is your civilian occupation I wrote it down and
[00:52:40] and turned it in but you know who's your drill sergeant and I knew it would all down he'll
[00:52:47] he'll fall down hill for me from there going from Hawaii going from like the kind of cruising mode
[00:52:55] of Hawaii yeah which I know it sounds like there's there's a little bit of well there's there's
[00:53:00] also like this whole competitive thing with your family and you're obviously we're driven because
[00:53:04] you're out creating these things and running for office and all this but I mean all of a sudden
[00:53:10] you're in boot camp was it a shock of course yeah I mean it's I'd be worried if it was
[00:53:17] a shock but I'm really you know I'm happy that I went in with the perspective of at least just
[00:53:26] understanding that whatever the madness is there's a purpose to it and don't get I I just I've
[00:53:33] never I've always been a pretty chill person and I don't get freaked out by that much and
[00:53:40] yeah so yeah I actually in a very weird and twisted way really loved it it was it was the
[00:53:46] camaraderie and the kind of bond that that is built in a very short period of time with a whole
[00:53:52] bunch of strangers from all over the country knowing that and appreciating that like all of us
[00:53:58] are there for the same reason all of us are there for the same purpose whatever the motivating
[00:54:02] decision was to unless really didn't matter that you know we all were the same uniform and all
[00:54:09] the same team it was it was I loved it how long after you got back from boot camp and AIT was it
[00:54:15] that you went on your first deployment came back home at the end of 2003 from training and then
[00:54:23] the 29th Brigade Combat Team from the Hawaii National Guard was activated I want to say
[00:54:29] the notification came out in the summer of 2004 I was campaigning for my reelection at that
[00:54:38] point in time and remember going in and and taking a break from knocking on doors knocking on doors
[00:54:48] again and I got an email at home check my email at home and and got the notification of the deployment
[00:54:56] but I was not on the I was not on the deployment roster because they they already had somebody who
[00:55:03] filled you know that job in the medical in the field medical company and so I immediately called my
[00:55:08] commander and just said hey like what's what's the deal here I don't see my name on the roster
[00:55:14] I said tell see congratulations like you get to stay home you don't have to go and
[00:55:21] that bothered me a lot and I just said no I just you know I knew that there was no I could stay back
[00:55:30] and that to you know sitting my office in the state capital and watch everybody leave was not an option
[00:55:40] for me and so I continued the conversation with my my commander and I just said sir I'm going
[00:55:50] tell me what job I need to get trained in that you need filled so that I can go and that's
[00:55:55] that's that's what happened so I I kind of I I publicly withdrew from my reelection campaign
[00:56:01] it was too like to take my name off the ballot but told everybody like I'm not I'm not running for
[00:56:05] reelection volunteer to fill this position and we left restarted our active duty train up I think
[00:56:15] it was in August of of that year 2004 and then we were in country in early January 2005
[00:56:22] what job did you get trained for what job what bill did you do I it was medical logistics
[00:56:29] so supply which and you know specialist at this point yeah I was in the for kind of a fresh
[00:56:36] e-for and as as you know like okay I filled I filled the position but once we actually got there
[00:56:46] I ended up becoming I ended up filling a position that was previously held by an E7
[00:56:54] as the brigade surgeon operations person and so kind of was working you know like line of duty
[00:57:02] paperwork and injuries and tracking supplies for all of our medics and docs and PA's who were
[00:57:11] attached to all of like the infantry units and and and also every day just tracking going through
[00:57:20] going through the the report every day for our our brigade commander of looking
[00:57:26] name by name down this list of of casualties that had occurred in the previous 24 hours to
[00:57:33] see if there was anyone there from our nearly 3000 person brigade and make sure that they were
[00:57:40] getting taken care of whether in country to stay in country or getting evacuated and staying with
[00:57:46] them and tracking their care every step of the way until eventually they made their way home.
[00:57:53] Where were you actually stationed in Iraq? We were in a balad in L.A. Anaconda,
[00:58:00] most of us were there that was kind of the base and then we had units in camp victory and Baghdad
[00:58:04] and in a couple other kind of smaller fobs out in different areas and so I moved around a little bit
[00:58:13] kind of going out and visiting some of our units and checking in on them where they you know
[00:58:19] where they were but that was that was primarily where I spent most of the time. And how did you
[00:58:24] what was that deployment like from you know your perspective now looking back? What kind of lessons
[00:58:30] did you bring back? What did you learn from that deployment to Iraq? A lot. Yeah I came back
[00:58:42] and my family told me this after I don't think I fully realized how much I had changed
[00:58:50] but it was something that they immediately noticed in coming back just
[00:58:57] more sober and more focused and that really came from you know I talked a little bit about how
[00:59:11] realizing from a young age like death can come at any moment well that's that's a philosophical
[00:59:15] realization and being there that became very real very quickly and you know there there was
[00:59:27] have you been there did you ever pass through there when I went to Belad I'd be there for like 20 minutes
[00:59:32] and go to a meeting and leave so I barely remember anything about Belad. And did you come in
[00:59:36] like vehicle or hardware? Yeah so there was within the first couple of days of us arriving there it's a big
[00:59:43] camp massive and so you know kind of was going out and like okay orienting myself where is everything at
[00:59:50] and I noticed right away at the north gate of that camp at least at that time I don't know if it's
[00:59:55] still there but there was a big there's a big huge sign that someone had put up on you know that you
[01:00:02] would see every time you leave camp out through the north gate which is where most of our patrols
[01:00:07] use that gate that the sign red is today the day and I just remember being stopped in my tracks
[01:00:15] and just take it a minute to to to to take that in and the meaning of it so that none of us would ever
[01:00:24] forget that today could be the day and that that was the welcome message and it really
[01:00:40] it hit home so much in in that daily task that I had of actually seeing names of people who I never
[01:00:51] knew people in different parts of of of of of serving different parts of the country but also
[01:00:55] people who I did know whose names would pop up on that list every single day that I went through
[01:01:02] and recognizing again how precious life is and any any any any any moment
[01:01:11] you know that that could be your last and then of course we we had unfortunately you know we lost
[01:01:18] a lot of people during that deployment and to me it it it really it it changed everything for
[01:01:26] me because ultimately coming home I knew there was absolutely no way that I could just go back
[01:01:38] to the life that I had left behind as though I didn't just experience like the people like
[01:01:42] oh you're gonna go back and run if you're sitting the state legislates you're gonna pick this up
[01:01:45] and kind of like hit the play button on my life that had been paused and it was impossible I
[01:01:51] didn't even think about it because I knew that somehow this experience that I had had I wanted
[01:01:57] I wanted to do something positive with it in being able to impact the kinds of decisions
[01:02:06] that took us all to that war in the first place so then so then what was the next move when
[01:02:16] you get home it's two is it now two thousand six yeah so we were in country for a year
[01:02:22] and then you know had the demobilization when we came back and so it was 2006 and I was trying to figure
[01:02:29] out okay what am I going to do there was no obvious answer to the question that I was asking
[01:02:34] which was how can I you know how can I take this and turn it into something positive
[01:02:41] ultimately I ended up volunteering our one of our US senators from Hawaii at that time
[01:02:48] Senator Akaka was being challenged in a primary election which kind of unheard of
[01:02:55] the power of incumbency is very real plus he's like the kindest most Aloha guy you will
[01:03:03] ever ever meet in your entire life no one has a bad thing to say about him but he got this
[01:03:09] challenge that came out of nowhere and I didn't know him at all personally had no personal
[01:03:13] relationship whatsoever the guy challenging him I did have some some interaction with
[01:03:24] that was not positive and so I was I was like okay I'm going to go volunteer full-time for Senator
[01:03:30] Akaka make sure that that he wins his reelection and he did and he I don't know if he was
[01:03:40] already or I think he was after the reelection he became the chairman of the US Committee for
[01:03:46] Veterans Affairs and so after volunteering on the campaign as Chief of Staff said hey do you want
[01:03:51] to come and work in Washington and as a legislative aid and help him with that work on the committee
[01:03:57] and you know environment and energy natural resource few other areas and so that's what I did
[01:04:03] and that up going and working with him in Washington for a couple of years
[01:04:09] went through OCS while I was there and how did you get an OCS billet did you graduate college
[01:04:17] somewhere along the way good question I forgot about that fire I was working I was I
[01:04:27] was while in Iraq working on my degree going on the education center tent and you know like okay
[01:04:35] sometimes you got mortars coming in and the alarm sounds you got to go in the bunker and come back out
[01:04:39] and say I was I was continuing my education while I was there and I had gotten just enough credits
[01:04:47] needed 60 credits go to OCS and I had just enough credits to go and I was still working on my
[01:04:53] degree when I was in DC and I was you know working there and so I was kind of working full time
[01:04:57] into school at night but yeah split in split in and then got I think you needed 90 credits to get
[01:05:04] your commission or something like that. I still have to keep squeak in about. Yeah so I just
[01:05:12] barely squeaked by. It's been um so you got to OCS is it anything anything shocking about OCS anything
[01:05:21] that was I loved I I knew obviously OCS is to train leaders but I didn't know going in
[01:05:30] the depth of that and that was why that was why I wanted to go through OCS and I graduated from
[01:05:34] basic training I was like I want to be the sergeant major the army one day all about it and then you
[01:05:40] know I got a deployment under my belt and got to witness some some examples of great leadership
[01:05:46] also some examples of leaders that were lacking in a lot of areas and and especially in a
[01:05:51] deployed deployed setting in a dangerous way and that was that that made a major impact for me
[01:05:57] coming back to say okay you know I same thing like I can complain about having shitty leaders
[01:06:03] or I can actually go and try to be be a good leader of soldiers and and I love and I tell kids
[01:06:11] who come and ask me like hey I think I want to join the military coming off sir very biased
[01:06:16] yes you can go do the West Point thing and that's great highly highly highly recommend OCS
[01:06:22] because it is it is intense it is relatively short and it is just like it is it is the essentials
[01:06:32] of provide it it provides you with the essential tools to to begin your leadership path
[01:06:40] and I just I loved it so much that I ended up going back as a tack officer after I had
[01:06:46] gotten a deployment as a platoon leader under my belt and then I loved it even more.
[01:06:53] How long is this how long is our OCS? So there's the active duty army OCS at
[01:06:58] for betting which is I think three maybe between three and four months. I went through an accelerated
[01:07:06] National Guard OCS in Alabama at Fort McClullin that uses the same program of instruction as the
[01:07:15] Fort Bending Program but just condenses it down to I think it was maybe ten weeks and the
[01:07:22] like the difference is like they get weekends off at Fort Bending like they get to use computers
[01:07:27] and phones and like that and we got none of that it was it was seven days a week you know
[01:07:33] for am to midnight all operators like no access to technology whatsoever so everything you were doing
[01:07:40] it was like you're writing it you're writing your your six-page operator yourself and
[01:07:47] you know it sucked as you're going through it of course but you know I'm old enough now
[01:07:52] I'm approaching 18 years now in the army reserves and so I'm like one of those old people
[01:07:57] is like man you guys got so good now back in the day back in the day
[01:08:05] you uh so then you go on another deployment and this time you go too quick you're in quite
[01:08:12] that time yeah yeah we were it was a different it was a different mission for the brigade and kind
[01:08:17] of each of the battalions were tasked out in in a lot of different areas a lot of our our infantry
[01:08:23] battalions or cab battalions were doing convoy security from within Kuwait and an out of Iraq
[01:08:28] um my platoon was attached to field artillery battalion and we were we it I and I I'm so
[01:08:35] grateful for this but we were we were physically located very very far away from the flagpole
[01:08:41] and then the big bases that that exist in Kuwait so we were within an active Kuwait-y naval base
[01:08:48] and right on the water which you know it's my gig I gotta be close to the water if I can
[01:08:52] um but our our main mission the artillery battalion had kind of a forced protection mission
[01:09:02] but my platoon uh we had had two things one was kind of security like like high level
[01:09:12] security if we had VIPs coming into Kuwait or and we worked with the embassy a lot we did a lot of
[01:09:16] stuff in and around the embassy so like PSD like personal security you know we did security for a lot
[01:09:24] of the ammunition movements from the ports to where they had to go and then also um we did
[01:09:31] I had a training mission which was the which was the the fun one for me it was being able to go
[01:09:34] and train the the Kuwaiti army on you know marksmanship um basic you know how to clear building
[01:09:42] uh what do you do if you're dealing with like a civil disturbance or a riot
[01:09:47] right control
[01:09:51] it was it was it was it was it was interesting for me though because um you know I
[01:10:01] platoon leader for an military police platoon in Kuwait where
[01:10:07] I didn't realize until we got there they don't allow women on their bases at all it doesn't matter
[01:10:14] if you're the general's wife or you're a janitor there are no women what if you told
[01:10:19] you gathered told see gathered showed up and I really didn't know when we rolled up
[01:10:25] like that first day to go in and meet the unit and meet the unit commander obviously I'm in uniform
[01:10:31] and my hair is up I got you know ball of hair on the back of my head and I didn't know what they
[01:10:35] were gonna do at the gate did you have other females in your platoon I had I had uh two
[01:10:42] two females in my platoon there uh one was the knee three one was the knee four
[01:10:48] the rest were you know these are guys who are working state local or federal law enforcement
[01:10:53] mostly at home in their civilian jobs and just about all of them had at least one or two deployments
[01:10:58] under their belt and so there there's seasoned experienced guys but yeah so I showed up I showed
[01:11:05] up on day one and you know kind of showed my decar to the gate and the gate guard was didn't
[01:11:10] really know what to do but he saw you know he saw the American flag and he was like oh okay
[01:11:18] go ahead and and so my I was my partner and this was a master sergeant at E8
[01:11:23] and super super cool he's going guy and and so we went and we started to we got introduced to the
[01:11:31] guys that we'd be training we ended up doing a number of iterations of different groups of guys
[01:11:36] but you know kind of went down the line shaken hands and saying hello and uh there was probably
[01:11:44] half of the co-edey guys who I was invisible there certainly was no shaking up hands certainly
[01:11:51] no eye contact or even acknowledgement that I was standing there and you know okay got it challenge
[01:12:00] how do you go from like I don't exist in your universe to actually being able to help provide you
[01:12:06] with some instruction and and develop the report necessary to be able to do that and you know so I
[01:12:15] I kind of drawing from maybe the Aloha and Hawaii of just recognizing hey you know we're
[01:12:22] we're different people different backgrounds different language different culture different everything
[01:12:27] but I respect like I respect you and I'm gonna treat you with that Aloha that respect
[01:12:37] and gradually I started to see the ice kind of started to fall and ultimately you know
[01:12:44] when we're out of the range and I'm walking up and I'm telling them like hey like okay here's this
[01:12:48] like basic safety things and and then like okay I'm gonna show you how to do it and then you know
[01:12:54] gradually I got to the point and I knew I knew I had made progress we sat down for lunch
[01:13:00] and they started to share their lunch with me is all like food food as food is the ultimate you know
[01:13:07] bridge builder and I knew once you were like hey like yeah here try my food like oh yeah
[01:13:11] oh awesome like cool yeah that's really good and it got to the point where
[01:13:17] on on their graduation day of that first group their commander
[01:13:22] had everybody in the room everybody who's seated there again and they're getting all the
[01:13:25] graduations certificates and everything and their commander asked me to come forward and presented
[01:13:32] me with this plaque of appreciation and thanks and some of there was some Americans civilians who
[01:13:39] were also working that mission and they had been there longer than we had and they said
[01:13:44] it's all after were there like Tulsa I hope you understand what a big deal that was for
[01:13:48] this co-edimentary officer you know the traditional bearded Muslim man to recognize the accomplishments
[01:14:00] of a woman and I was very grateful to have been able to experience
[01:14:10] experience that and recognizing the bigger significance that you know not so much about like
[01:14:16] well this is about women's rights or empowerment but more so about how to overcome seemingly
[01:14:24] impossible barriers to get to a place where you have mutual professional respect and understanding
[01:14:33] and and the power of that alone and there are obvious parallels that we could point to in today's
[01:14:39] world here in America but yeah yeah that's that's an awesome story and
[01:14:44] lately I've been talking a lot about the fact that if you want respect you got to give
[01:14:49] respect if you want people to listen to you you got to listen to them if you want to have
[01:14:54] influence over people you've got to allow them to influence you and if you want to build trust
[01:14:58] with people you've got to trust them yes and it's interesting you know you kind of captured
[01:15:05] well at least for sure the respect part is Aloha right it's the Aloha spirit of hey you know
[01:15:11] what you're a little bit different than me but it's all good we'll figure it out and that way
[01:15:15] of building relationships is so much better than you saying hey look I might be a woman you
[01:15:22] might not think I'm here but I am a exactly 10 and he United States Army and you will like
[01:15:27] okay good luck with that you never would have made any progress at all none and and so
[01:15:33] taking a little a little bit of Aloha apparently with a little lunch as well goes a long way over time
[01:15:38] and and and people want to be confrontational because it seems like well it's the least
[01:15:45] offensive thing to your ego right when when someone looks at you what doesn't look at you treat
[01:15:49] you like you're not there that that can be a blow to your ego that your ego can't
[01:15:54] can't repress it it just has to come out your ego has to say you will look at me damn it
[01:16:00] you know I am told see listen to me you have to listen and and all those things even though it
[01:16:06] seems like it would be you know this direct I just need to be direct with them and tell them that
[01:16:11] I and it's like okay I'm telling you that that attitude doesn't work and look we're talking
[01:16:16] about a pretty serious cultural divide yeah but it happens with everything it happens if you and I
[01:16:20] are trying to figure out how to execute a mission and you think we should do one way and I think we should
[01:16:24] do a different way and I tell you well to tell you that's because you don't you haven't done this
[01:16:28] kind of operation before or because you you haven't been in as long as me or because you don't you you
[01:16:32] went to OCS and I went to West Point so therefore I know but all those things are wrong all those
[01:16:36] things are going to make it harder for us to come to a good an actual good the best possible decision
[01:16:42] which is what we want so put your ego in check add a little a low-hot of that and and we can
[01:16:48] actually make some progress and and unfortunately you know it's kind of like what I started off talking
[01:16:52] about you know if you have an idea about something I've an idea about something and my my default mode
[01:16:59] is to say you're freaking wrong how are we gonna how are we gonna talk about it how are we gonna
[01:17:06] actually figure out what to do no you stay on your side and all stay on my side and we won't do anything
[01:17:12] which is a freaking nightmare yeah and that's where that's where I see the parallel and that
[01:17:18] experience with the Aloha that that I strived to bring every day to my work in Washington is you
[01:17:25] start with you know finding that common ground even with such incredible start differences that
[01:17:32] that are real you start with okay what what is what is the common ground that we can stand on
[01:17:38] comfortably together coupled with what is our shared objective what is the thing that we are
[01:17:45] trying to accomplish and recognizing that whatever your personal feelings may be however strong
[01:17:50] they may maybe what your views are ultimately if you can find some commonality in both those places
[01:17:58] then you recognize that it's not about you it's about this shared goal and purpose that you have
[01:18:06] and then like you'll find a way you'll figure it out that again this is another thing I've been talking
[01:18:11] a lot about lately is if you and I can get aligned we we can come to a solution but we sometimes
[01:18:18] have to go pretty high up the ladder of alignment to get to a point where it actually meets so we have
[01:18:23] a mission and you want to attack the target from the left and I want to attack the target from the right
[01:18:28] well that's that's okay as long as we both know that we want to secure that target that's what we want to
[01:18:34] do and then all one of us has to do is put our ego in check for 15 seconds and say you know what
[01:18:39] tell us a attacking from the right sounds good let's do it your way right and because I just want to get to
[01:18:43] I just want to get the target secured that's what I want to do that's that's okay
[01:18:49] where we also get into a problem is a gender now you have an agenda where you want your
[01:18:53] opportunity to do it and I want my opportunity to do it so then we have to rise above those
[01:18:57] agendas now it's possible that our agendas that your agenda still aligned with the goal you want to
[01:19:02] get the target to get great you want your opportunity to do it you know what if I can put my ego
[01:19:05] and check for 15 seconds and say you know what sounds good tell us you want you to take your
[01:19:09] puttune can take lead and all support you right sounds good all I want to do is get the mission done
[01:19:14] exactly and people run around in circles and attack each other and worst part they never make progress
[01:19:20] they never make it to the target because they can't even they can't even come to any kind of agreement
[01:19:25] yeah that that that that sounds exactly like one of the first things I was introduced to as a new
[01:19:31] member of Congress where I the the message was delivered very clearly from the leadership
[01:19:37] within the within the democratic party and so my Republicans went through some of the same
[01:19:42] stuff on their side so this isn't about one party or another but the message being like hey look
[01:19:47] this is about winning the election and if we're in power it's about keeping power if we are
[01:19:52] not in power it's about how how do we get it back and so if there's a bill for example
[01:19:58] that deals with whatever let's say it deals with transportation something about as universally
[01:20:04] agreed upon as you can get like we need to move from a to be all of us do so there's a bill on
[01:20:10] transportation infrastructure and it's introduced by a Republican don't support that bill you should
[01:20:18] support one that could be virtually identical as long as there's a Democrat name at the top
[01:20:23] that's leading that effort because that will allow the Democrat person and the Democratic party
[01:20:29] to then take credit for it which will then be put on a brochure or a TV ad that you can use in
[01:20:35] the next campaign which will get us closer to getting power or or maintaining power and this is
[01:20:43] where we want running to problems in the world yeah is when ultimately we're not aligned
[01:20:51] that that's where the actual problem comes in is if you where you want to go the target that you want
[01:20:56] to hit is not the same as the target that I want to hit and then we can't we can't overcome these
[01:21:02] problems because we are not going to the same place they don't they're not the same place so how
[01:21:08] we're gonna go we can't be two places of once we're gonna your place or my place and that's where
[01:21:12] we run into a problem when people are saying well the main point of us doing this is to get power
[01:21:18] not to help American people not to move transportation in a good direction but just so we get
[01:21:24] reelected and if that's what the goal is we can't get aligned and it's a problem and that is exactly
[01:21:28] where the lack of alignment exists because you have a political infrastructure where both political
[01:21:34] parties are ultimately and this is not every single person but if you look at the goals of the
[01:21:39] leadership of both parties it is about power so right you know I served in Congress for eight years
[01:21:46] for the first half of my time their Republicans were in charge Democrats were in minority
[01:21:52] and then Democrats won and took over the House Democrats are in charge of Republicans in my
[01:21:57] naughty and you just see it play out where whoever's in power is trying to keep power whoever's not
[01:22:02] is trying to is trying to take it and there's no alignment because they're looking out for their own
[01:22:08] interests for the parties and they are not ultimately making decisions about what legislation
[01:22:14] comes to the House floor or what issues are being tackled based on what's in the best interest of
[01:22:20] the country which is where that alignment must be and it's how our system of governance was set up
[01:22:29] that not that you have everybody is part of one party or marching in lockstep or having all of the
[01:22:35] same views but instead that you bring the diversity of different views experiences and backgrounds
[01:22:42] and ideas by having in the House of Representatives 435 people from all across the country all
[01:22:48] elected by constituents in their districts who can then bring their ideas where you have debate
[01:22:54] and conversation you have bills that that theoretically go through committee where you can offer
[01:22:58] amendments and try to strengthen whatever the proposal might be or kill it if it's a bad idea
[01:23:05] and then you've got a vote on the floor like this is civics 101 that we learn about in school
[01:23:10] it does not exist in reality though today because instead of figuring out hey how do we
[01:23:17] work out our differences and come to that same goal of like how do we fix all of the pot holes in
[01:23:22] our roads in Hawaii and all over the country okay we need to invest in some infrastructure how
[01:23:28] do we do that how much money how is this best going to be executed instead and we saw this
[01:23:32] play out over you know I'm when Trump first got elected I reporters asked me what what do you
[01:23:38] think tell see is the one thing like what's the low hanging fruit where they're we're bipartisan
[01:23:44] agreement and work is possible I and most other people said infrastructure every community needs it
[01:23:52] every this is a domestic job creator that actually solves real problems that need to be solved
[01:23:59] it never happened there was no infrastructure bill that even really came before Congress for any
[01:24:04] serious consideration and why is that like the most low-hanging fruit that everybody agrees on that
[01:24:10] objective didn't happen because of partisan differences and an unwillingness to say okay yeah Democrats
[01:24:18] had a certain idea and a certain dollar amount Republicans had a different idea and a different
[01:24:21] dollar amount but there was never any real good faith serious effort to say okay where can we meet
[01:24:27] in the middle what am I willing to give up what are you willing to give up so that we can actually
[01:24:31] start to deliver on fulfilling the needs the very real needs that exist within our communities
[01:24:38] so I know you said not everyone is so entrenched but what percentage of people are entrenched
[01:24:44] on the left and the right I would say most I would say most and and not because they're
[01:24:50] bad people necessarily but if you look at the system that exists the power that the political
[01:24:59] parties have is massive and unfortunately there are two few people who go to Washington willing to
[01:25:13] buck that power and deal with the consequences of that and the consequences being hey if you don't
[01:25:19] if you don't tow the party line then if you've got a tough challenge in your election campaign
[01:25:24] we're not going to help fund TV ads for you for example or we're not going to play resources to
[01:25:30] support you or we'll pull you off the committee that that you're on that you really like or maybe
[01:25:37] we're not going to consider your bill on you we won't allow your bill to come to the floor for a
[01:25:42] vote and sometimes these are very direct statements that are made and sometimes they're they're
[01:25:46] signals that are sent in an indirect way and so the results of having two few people who are
[01:25:53] willing to kind of stand up and and make decisions based on purely based on on merit versus
[01:26:01] the political pressures is you end up having a lot of people who either enjoy and get right into
[01:26:11] playing the political games and are all about it and then you have other people who maybe unwillingly
[01:26:19] or are even as they are disheartened but feel like they have no other option than to play the game
[01:26:25] and so it you know and and frankly it's because they see I see people like me you know
[01:26:32] President Obama was president during you know two thai came I was sworn into Congress in 2013
[01:26:38] so his first four years and then I had President Trump as president for the last four years
[01:26:42] that I was in Congress and in both cases you know if there was an issue that I agreed on
[01:26:48] there's a bomber a Trump I spoke out and said it if there's an issue I disagree on
[01:26:52] Obama a Trump I spoke out and said it which is which is is is kind of heresy in Washington
[01:26:59] because the expectation is even if it's the same exact scenario the same exact situation
[01:27:05] if it's your person in the White House and you don't like it you don't say anything but if it's
[01:27:12] the other party then I mean the world is going to end look at how this terrible thing and it's such
[01:27:17] blatant double standard and so hypocritical I think this is one of the reason why voters are just
[01:27:22] like come on like we can see what you're doing so ridiculous exactly but you know they exist within
[01:27:31] this bubble where the it's I mean it is it's I've talked about this before is it's kind of like
[01:27:37] high school there is a popularity contest and it's both people it it's this ecosystem where people
[01:27:44] really care a whole lot about what parties they're invited to or who answers their phone calls
[01:27:52] it's not you're just going to point this out because I've heard you talk about this before
[01:27:56] you're not saying like oh it's like high school where people care about what parties they're
[01:28:01] invited to you're saying people actually are thinking well Tulsi didn't like me to that party so
[01:28:08] we're going to step on her bill that she put for all give you an example very it is it is literal
[01:28:13] it's not like you know it's not an analogy it's literal there there was you know in the pre-COVID
[01:28:19] world and maybe even in the pre-Trump world the White House correspondence dinner is like
[01:28:25] the big event of the year and it is hosted by the media for the media and you only get invited
[01:28:35] as a politician if someone in the media invites you to go as as your guest it's kind of like
[01:28:41] Washington DC's Oscars kind of gala type situation so you know it's all of the fancies
[01:28:49] everything and Hollywood celebrities fly in for it and it's like a it's a really big thing
[01:28:56] and I remember you know I I happened to get an invitation to go the first year I was there
[01:29:02] without knowing anything about what it was and I was talking to some of my colleagues are like
[01:29:06] Tulsi you got in it like I've like this guy my friend he's like I've been here seven years
[01:29:12] and I've never been invited to that like Hoka Brother up and it was so I mean it was so surreal to
[01:29:19] me especially because having gone from that where I was invited to go to that or other things you know
[01:29:24] like the first few years I was there and then you know I stopped getting those invitations
[01:29:32] because like hold on a second she's actually like challenging whatever the narrative is
[01:29:39] or challenging decisions made within her own party or saying or doing things that didn't
[01:29:44] fall within the mainstream of popularity in Washington DC and so I've experienced the arc
[01:29:51] of like okay you're cool you seem kind of cool and like you know you're a surfer you're better
[01:29:56] in your this or that and then all of a sudden like oh wait hold on you actually have something to say
[01:30:00] that's not just whatever literally the email talking points are of the day then you know
[01:30:09] it turns into something else let's let's rewind it a little bit to when you actually ran
[01:30:16] so you get home from in in what 2009 you get home 2009 I came back from my second deployment in 2009
[01:30:26] and kind of faced a similar pivotal decision point on what to do next and just like the first
[01:30:35] deployment I came back with the same kind of sense of purpose and mission of wanting to
[01:30:40] find a way to be in a position where I could I could help influence decisions or make decisions
[01:30:46] about our countries foreign policy and about our military and but didn't know exactly what or
[01:30:54] how I would do that didn't there was no obvious choice at that time I had applied for something
[01:31:00] called the White House Fellows program which I thought would have been a great opportunity where
[01:31:06] basically it's it's a highly competitive you heard of it before yeah so it's it's this highly
[01:31:10] competitive program that ultimately if selected you serve for a year as a senior special assistant
[01:31:18] to a cabinet member or to the president or the vice president so you kind of you know jump in
[01:31:24] your way up to directly being able to help influence and impact issues so I had applied for that
[01:31:32] got through to the regional finals and then got through to the final final interviews which was
[01:31:38] I think three days of assessment essentially which consisted of you know we're told okay
[01:31:46] as soon as literally as soon as you arrive there you're being assessed by the judges I think there
[01:31:50] were 12 judges and ultimately they would choose probably 12 people out of maybe I think maybe
[01:31:55] they're 20 of us there and so whether it was the the welcoming reception or these actual
[01:32:04] boards essentially that that you would go individually and sit before there's you know I think
[01:32:09] four different boards of three judges and you know do a Q&A kind of thing and then there was
[01:32:16] something that they gave us an exercise where all of us who were there we had to pull names
[01:32:22] or positions out of a hat and so I think the position I got was White House Chief of Staff
[01:32:28] someone else was the president someone else was the vice president and then they say okay here's the
[01:32:32] scenario I remember was I could say like country X is just launched an attack on us and you have
[01:32:42] you've convened a meeting in the situation room execute like you've got 15 minutes to prepare
[01:32:49] and then you go and execute and so role playing scenario kind of war gaming thing and and the
[01:32:55] judges are just standing there watching and just trying to figure out okay what are the dynamics and
[01:32:59] you know who were the alphas and who's taking charge and who's just like the wall flower sitting
[01:33:03] on the edge and how do you make decisions that process that kind of stuff it was it was a really
[01:33:06] cool experience long story short I didn't get picked what I don't think you got picked
[01:33:14] I don't know I really don't know I I sought out a couple of the judges that I had
[01:33:20] developed a little bit of a rapport with to kind of get some feedback and and this was part of the
[01:33:24] thing like every step of the way people who were former White House fellows who had given me
[01:33:28] some mentorship on how to approach the process in advance and and some of the judges like
[01:33:34] they're like off your shoe it like you were exactly the kind of person that this program was built for
[01:33:40] and and so I stupidly had started to believe all of that and you know went through it
[01:33:49] and was careful and did my preparation and went into it but you know in my mind I had already told
[01:33:55] myself like you got this like you're in and then so when I was I was writing the Metro and DC
[01:34:04] and I remember getting off at Union Station and coming up the escalator and then my phone buzzed
[01:34:09] with a voicemail of course I was waiting for the call and the voicemail said hi Tulsi we
[01:34:16] were Grett to inform you so for that moment I was just like I was I was incredibly disappointed
[01:34:25] obviously but then had to reset be like okay so like that's off the table and so I ended up I ended up
[01:34:34] you know I knew that I was continuing to see what what can I do and I ended up running for
[01:34:39] I'd getting elected to the Honolulu City Council and focusing on those pot holes and you know
[01:34:46] trash and sewers and parks and and law enforcement for two years until my former boss Senator
[01:34:54] Akaka retired from the US Senator announced he was retiring and the one of the members of Congress
[01:35:02] said that she was going to run for his seat which left the vacancy in the house and ultimately
[01:35:07] that's that's where I made the decision I made the decision to run knowing that specifically
[01:35:14] in the United States Congress I would be exactly where I needed to be to try to influence and impact
[01:35:20] those decisions was it a tough campaign I mean it's incredibly tough who are you going against
[01:35:26] there were six people who ran you know it's strong democratic state so the the real election is the
[01:35:32] primary election and there were six people who were running in that democratic primary but the main
[01:35:39] person who was kind of the assumed winner of the election even you know nine months out from the
[01:35:48] election was a guy who had just run for and lost a race for governor but who was also the former
[01:35:56] mayor of of the city and county of Honolulu and so you know just for some perspective our state
[01:36:03] has about 1.4 million population around 980,000 of which live on a wall and the district that
[01:36:13] we were running for there's there's two members of Congress from Hawaii one is kind of the urban
[01:36:19] representative that that has almost the whole South Shore of Oahu the urban that kind of density urban
[01:36:24] populated area and then the other member of Congress which was the seat that I was running for has
[01:36:30] the west side nor shore and east side of Oahu and all of the neighbor islands and so I came into this
[01:36:36] with I think it was about 2% known name recognition in that district because my city council
[01:36:46] district was actually in the other it was in the urban part of Oahu so there was again no overlap
[01:36:52] in those districts and the guy the another front runner in the race he had everybody in the state
[01:36:57] knew who he was he also had a little bit of baggage that came with having just been the mayor and
[01:37:04] that's a whole other whole other conversation but so so the challenge was was pretty great to go
[01:37:13] from like 3% against 100% and somehow I had to try to cover that gap and I just you know I remember
[01:37:20] meeting with with some of the political you know elders for lack of a better word in Hawaii
[01:37:29] and letting them know that people I had decent relationships with letting him know that I was
[01:37:34] gonna run and and why and getting a lot of patronizing responses back saying you know tell see
[01:37:40] you're I think I was 30 at the time 31 here young you have no chance against this guy
[01:37:48] so just you know don't waste your time and come back and try again in like 20 years you'll be great
[01:37:54] in 20 years and that I was like I don't operate on that timeline so you're like hold my
[01:38:02] beer pretty much pretty much did you just go super aggressive how did how the hell did you make
[01:38:09] up that kind of distance well so first I I'd had to fundraising as a huge thing because I needed
[01:38:16] to be able to have the resources to let people know I existed and who I am first of all just my name
[01:38:23] period and then to let them know you know my experience in my background and why why I was wanting
[01:38:30] to serve them in Congress and so you know we started out we started out just like putting signs up
[01:38:36] around the district and hoping that that would cause for people to say who's Tulsi Gabbard
[01:38:43] like what what is this about and and and it was it was a lot of time going and doing what what I
[01:38:52] called the most extensive job interview ever where I went and traveled to each island and spent
[01:38:58] a lot of time in communities with individuals with groups small groups large groups introducing
[01:39:05] myself to them and answering their questions and letting them know why I wanted to serve them
[01:39:11] in Congress what kind of leadership I would bring where I stood on on different issues that they
[01:39:15] cared about and ultimately what happened was five months before election day my I was pulling
[01:39:26] at 20% to the front runners 65 and then the rest was split between the other people and I have
[01:39:33] like awesome progress for 20 years exactly exactly and I just I just continued you know I was
[01:39:44] I was on the phone and I was asking people for support and raising money and then also out on the
[01:39:48] road just you know seven days a week all day and it was it was it was it was an incredible incredible
[01:39:55] experience election day comes around in August of 2012 and all the way up until about two weeks
[01:40:05] before the election the local media and even some of the national coverage was just like this
[01:40:12] guys this guy's got it I had heard from other people he was already interviewing staff a few months
[01:40:18] before the election that he planned to hire once he won our debate we had one big
[01:40:27] televised debate we had a few others but there was one big televised debate I passed him in the
[01:40:32] hall right before the debate and he was singing that song black eyed peas I think tonight's gonna be
[01:40:42] a good night as he looked back at me and and I will I will I have been told I killed it in the
[01:40:51] debate and that was where a lot of people first started to take notice like who is she and I think
[01:40:58] I think it may may have caught him by surprise just a little bit but still like all the way up
[01:41:04] until about two weeks before it was like he's got it and then some of the polls started to shift
[01:41:09] and some of the local news they were like wait I had this can't be right these polls can't be right
[01:41:14] because you can't see a big turnaround I ended up winning the primary election going from that 20%
[01:41:22] five months before to actually beating him by a 22% margin on election day and it was it was
[01:41:30] people to be good yeah people in DC like the next day they're like okay like what scandal caused
[01:41:41] him to to allowed you to win essentially or what was the thing that you know that happened and it was
[01:41:48] it was there was none it was literally I think the difference between someone who felt they were
[01:41:56] entitled to the position because of a number of reasons and and me recognizing what the position
[01:42:04] really is it's a position of trust and responsibility that is granted to you by the voters
[01:42:12] in the state and they are the ones who I'm accountable to and who I work for and it was just it was it was
[01:42:21] the our local kind of Walter Cronkite anchor of our new station who's been doing it for ever
[01:42:28] longer than I probably for about 30 or 40 years he's still on TV now he's a Vietnam veteran
[01:42:35] and that election night he was reporting the results and he actually started to get choked up
[01:42:41] and and got a little got a little tearful because he understood why I was running bringing that
[01:42:50] experience of service and and having been deployed and the significance of
[01:43:00] that I was going to Congress not for myself but that I was bringing my brothers and sisters in
[01:43:06] uniform with me and and it was it was a heavy night I mean it was you know there
[01:43:13] are parties and things going on but I remember leaving the the hall that night on election night
[01:43:20] and my sister was walking out with me and she's like Tulsi you know you're allowed to celebrate
[01:43:26] you know you're allowed to be happy about this but I was just I was immediately like okay
[01:43:32] all right these are the results what are we waking up and doing tomorrow what what's the next task
[01:43:37] what do we have to do now in order to make sure that we we hit our next Martin and that's
[01:43:42] um and and that's kind of the the focus that I that I carried with me throughout is you know
[01:43:50] I'm not entitled to anything and I am here only because the people and in my community and my home
[01:43:57] state have trusted me to to work for them and to to be their voice and and to represent them
[01:44:05] to the best of my ability so the the hype of you winning that and come being the being the underdog
[01:44:11] champ rolling in deep did that that kind of came to you to DC right I mean that that hype there's
[01:44:17] some hype train yeah so Tulsi hype train mm-hmm oh say so the Tulsi hype train shows up
[01:44:25] and your sort of um your viewed I think it's actually Nancy Pelosi's called you like rising star
[01:44:33] which is you seem to hear that okay it did not like it doesn't get thrown around that term doesn't
[01:44:37] get thrown around about political people but you were like a quote rising star in the democratic
[01:44:45] party so you came with some hype yeah I didn't I didn't fully understand why but yeah it was
[01:44:53] there I mean I had you know she I was actually making up drill time with the national guard after
[01:44:59] that primary election um I remember being at my unit and she called my my cell phone I hadn't
[01:45:05] talked to her before and she called myself on and left the message and introduced herself and just
[01:45:11] said hey you know we have a democratic convention coming up in a few weeks I would love to have you
[01:45:16] come and be one of the featured speakers during prime time as um and speak about veterans let me know
[01:45:26] if you're interested and so again like that's not an opportunity that one gets when you've just
[01:45:34] been elected to Congress to go and speak to you know 50,000 people in an arena in the whole country
[01:45:40] yeah as the whole it's everybody yeah and and so you know I mean I was
[01:45:46] grateful for the opportunity and and went and it kind of yeah and then you know shortly after
[01:45:53] getting sworn in as a member of Congress I was asked hey will you be vice chair of the DNC and
[01:45:58] I was like what what is a vice chair do um what is what is actually that you're asking me to do and
[01:46:06] what what can I do and tell you so I said they're asking you to do it's freaking weird right this is
[01:46:13] all they they kind of saw you they saw a good horse to put money into an industry to a great story
[01:46:22] and they they wanted to get some control over that hype train yeah and and I think use you know
[01:46:30] be able to say hey you know there there are I mean there there are biographical boxes that I
[01:46:34] checked a lot of boxes for you know the diversity uh pick the diversity higher and and you know for
[01:46:42] me I'm you know just coming in to each of these experiences completely clear eyed and not getting
[01:46:48] googly eyed at all like oh my god they love me so much but just recognizing okay like what do
[01:46:54] what are you trying to use me for even uh what what do you get out of this and then for me thinking okay
[01:47:00] like weighing pros and cons and saying is this an opportunity that I can use to try to get some some
[01:47:07] good dawn and if it is then okay that makes sense like maybe there's a mutually beneficial thing here
[01:47:14] and if there's not then you know no thanks um but yeah that's that's that's where that's where things
[01:47:21] started so they start off like really awesome yeah hey you've got all the hype you've got opportunities
[01:47:27] they're looking at you as a as a potential kind of horse to put money into an invest into
[01:47:35] as long as we can control you on the track right that that's the fine print
[01:47:41] I what point did you did when was the first sort of time that you kind of bucked a little bit
[01:47:48] do you remember what it was yeah absolutely it was my first year in congress in 2018
[01:47:55] every year in congress and I I don't know I think this may date back to pre air conditioning days
[01:48:03] but every year in august congress goes into recess it's the hottest year of the month it's
[01:48:09] you know DC is a literal actual like geographical swamp and so you go you go back to your
[01:48:22] you you so you go back to your district everybody in the house and the senate you there's a
[01:48:25] recess in august you go back to your district and you get like four or five weeks at home or to go and
[01:48:30] do a congressional delegation trip to another country or whatever you said that space and time to do that
[01:48:35] and so I remember being home and getting word that President Obama wanted to go and launch
[01:48:45] air strikes and a military attack in Syria and I was filling up gas in my car one I so I started
[01:48:58] to get a lot of calls from constituents from people about this and this is where this is very
[01:49:03] quickly developing I don't have all the facts or information or intelligence or anything at that point
[01:49:09] but people were concerned and I was filling up I was filling up gas one day in copole and
[01:49:16] and a woman who pulled up her car next to me she saw me there and she came and walked over and she
[01:49:21] grabbed my arm she saw you can see you know my kids in the military please don't do this
[01:49:29] because I don't understand what it's for and and there was a number of other kinds of messages
[01:49:39] coming from people just either expressing total opposition or concern and just coming out of like
[01:49:45] you know Iraq and just everything that had led to that kind of cynicism and fatigue or okay
[01:49:52] we just want to go start another war in another country like what what did they do to us
[01:49:56] and so the recess time was cut short I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee at that time
[01:50:03] and I was throughout most of the time I was in Congress and so we got called back to DC early
[01:50:08] so that we could go through and get the intelligence briefings and actually get gather the information
[01:50:14] and then that was when I first started to take kind of a deep dive into what was happening in Syria
[01:50:20] and why he was proposing this and ultimately after going into the issue and the question and
[01:50:29] and really he was not going to come to Congress at first but then enough members of Congress said
[01:50:35] you can't like the Constitution does not allow you to unilaterally just start a war you have to
[01:50:40] come and get congressional approval for that and so that's what we went back and started to prepare
[01:50:46] for that vote that would happen and I just I came to the conclusion after studying the facts that
[01:50:52] it would be a counterproductive military action and much of it came from I mean we had hearings
[01:50:58] with Secretary then Secretary of State Kerry and others at the time who we're trying to tell Congress
[01:51:04] like well you know this is not going to be a pin prick strike but it's not going to be a decapitation
[01:51:12] it's going to be a punch in the gut and you know some of my follow-up questions were like okay
[01:51:18] so you're going to go and deliver a punch in the gut attack how will they respond oh you know
[01:51:26] we don't really know but we don't think it'll be a big deal okay who are their friends
[01:51:32] who are they going to call for help and how may they respond how could this potentially escalate
[01:51:40] into something that is no longer a punch in the gut but something that first second third fourth
[01:51:46] order of effects their response will require response for a must which require response and all of you
[01:51:51] know that the the the tit for tat that then begins once you go over and say I'm not going to cut
[01:51:57] your head off I'm just going to punch you in the gut and think that you're not going to do anything
[01:52:00] in response and I just saw so many of the similarities of a lack of foresight and
[01:52:08] strategic planning and for me again as military officer basic level like military decision making
[01:52:15] process and actually thinking through these things and I saw similarity like this could very
[01:52:22] easily become another kind of Iraq kind of situation where you start making these decisions
[01:52:28] and then they're on the fly and then you're not realizing or thinking through what do we do tomorrow
[01:52:32] and then the next day and and where do we go from here and also I wrote I wrote like an opinion piece
[01:52:44] expressing my opposition to the president president Obama's proposal published it and
[01:52:53] was the first Democrat to do so to express opposition to his proposal and very quickly got a call from the
[01:53:00] White House basically saying how dare you who in the White House it was the the first lady's
[01:53:12] chief of staff and I I still to this day scratch my head about why they asked her I knew her and maybe
[01:53:20] that was just simply the reason why but I would think that on a matter like this you would want to
[01:53:27] have I don't know maybe the national security director so I'm sorry like I don't know somebody
[01:53:32] but that was that was essentially the message is how dare you not only has a Democrat but because like
[01:53:38] you're from the president's home state how could you how could you so publicly disagree with
[01:53:42] him on something but the thing was Jaco is is nowhere in that conversation was the substance
[01:53:54] of the issue raised like hey here's why we think your opposition is misplaced or here's what
[01:54:02] you're not seeing or here's what nothing yeah nothing at all you know I wrote down
[01:54:10] while you were talking what's the commander's intent like when are we trying to do here because if you
[01:54:14] can't tell me what it is what why we're going to do what we're doing then we need to talk about it more
[01:54:19] yeah that's number one and you know as you just put it the reason why why are we doing something
[01:54:26] why are we doing it and by the way I tell people all the time if you work for me and we're doing
[01:54:31] something that you don't know why we're doing it you raise your hand and you say hey Jaco why the
[01:54:34] hell are we doing this and I say well here's why and you say well that doesn't make any sense
[01:54:37] and I go please explain that to me then so that I can make a better decision because if if I can't
[01:54:42] get my team on board then I must be I must not be seeing something or I'm not explaining my perspective
[01:54:47] well enough that they can go oh yeah I got it Jaco thank you and we now understand that thank you
[01:54:52] that's number one number two so when you fire off this article is that a good tactical move for you
[01:55:01] in other words you know would it may it have been a better move to say elicin I need to talk to
[01:55:09] you know you tell your friend the the first lady's chief of staff listen I want some
[01:55:13] clarification I don't want to get crazy here but look I just got back from my rack a few years ago
[01:55:18] it gets bad it gets ugly we got to make sure we know what we're doing can we have a further
[01:55:23] conversation because no one seems to be listening to me right now and it's a problem
[01:55:28] mm-hmm I chose to take that public course of action because I had just gone through
[01:55:35] days of internal discussions Q&A expressions of concern and essentially expressed all of those
[01:55:48] same points of opposition internally to members of the administration and saw that nothing was
[01:55:56] nothing was breaking through and that the answers that they were delivering were pretty
[01:56:03] candid and set and that there was not really there there was not really an interest of a discussion
[01:56:13] or a response like of introspection saying hey maybe we're missing something here and and
[01:56:18] or maybe we're not communicating clearly or you know that it was just like this is it this is what we're
[01:56:25] doing and the why like why what what are you trying to accomplish well we need to send a message okay
[01:56:30] send a message and then what like you can like communications a two-way street I can send you a message
[01:56:41] but if if I want that message to be effective like I need to anticipate how you might respond
[01:56:46] and so there was I chose the course of action that that I chose purely because I felt I had
[01:56:51] exhausted internal or maybe kind of back channel means of addressing those concerns.
[01:57:00] Seems like what did you also sort of had already done an assessment to think like these people don't
[01:57:07] listen. Yeah. This wasn't this wasn't just a one-day you decide you know what that said I'm
[01:57:11] going to fire off the article. It's a pre-existing condition that is when people say hey I got an
[01:57:18] issue with this we get told shut up get get on board with the program that's what we're going to do so you'd
[01:57:22] already experienced that. Yeah so I mean this this it in this specific situation it was not so there
[01:57:29] were other Democrats who who shared these kinds and Republicans who shared these concerns and that
[01:57:34] it were raising these questions within the hearings both public and and closed hearings
[01:57:41] so it wasn't like hey we expect everybody to like there was not a pressure coming from the
[01:57:47] Democratic leadership in this example saying hey we expect you to tow the line on this and just
[01:57:51] support this because it's President Obama so this was not that kind of situation there are other
[01:57:57] examples of that but yeah it just it was clear it was clear that the message that was coming from
[01:58:07] the administration was was really it was kind of a one-way communication and and so I knew enough
[01:58:14] to know that when when they're they're kind of locked and loaded in in their position the only thing
[01:58:22] that may cause them to change or to budge is public pressure and that's ultimately what happened
[01:58:30] it the public pressure was bipartisan and and reached such a volume that they never even brought
[01:58:38] the vote to Congress because they knew it would be an abject failure and and the the military
[01:58:46] action never happened and Obama got criticized for that because I don't know if you're
[01:58:51] remember but he this was like this is a red line right like okay and he got vastly criticized by
[01:58:56] Republicans and I think some Democrats like how how dare you not enforce your own red line and I still
[01:59:04] you know I think this was one of ultimately the final decision that he made I it was the right decision
[01:59:09] because because of all the reasons that I've held him as the wrong decision to to make in the first
[01:59:15] place but also it forced him to take a diplomatic path to resolve the issue that he was trying to
[01:59:19] address which is you know hey like maybe that should have been your first first primary course of
[01:59:26] action yeah don't paint yourself into a corner yeah exactly just like don't don't put yourself
[01:59:31] in a situation in a combat scenario where you can't maneuver don't do that don't put your you
[01:59:36] know don't don't don't put your back against a cliff where you can't go anywhere else yes don't don't
[01:59:40] don't don't do that's not a good move it's not a good tactical move it's not a good strategic move
[01:59:43] there you know this this whole thing when I when I ask you these questions one of the things that
[01:59:49] well you're gonna I know he I know you just told me you were reading about face right now well
[01:59:53] the crux of about spoiler alerter in about face hands up at the end of the Vietnam War
[01:59:58] what's not the end of the Vietnam War it's the end of his Vietnam War he goes and gets interviewed
[02:00:02] and says we're gonna lose if we don't change the way we're fighting and of course he gets drummed
[02:00:06] out of the army in a matter of months you know it's all bad and the question that I always
[02:00:12] kind of consider is well if he would have kept his mouth shut he would have had you know he would
[02:00:20] have had a brigade he would have had a division he would have had the influence of all many many
[02:00:24] more soldiers and much more strategy and and could have perhaps steered the war in a better direction
[02:00:32] if he would have played the game more now there's an emotional component to it which is completely
[02:00:38] understandable which is that hack worth absolutely love the army and he loved his soldiers and
[02:00:44] he was seen soldiers get killed and wounded every single day and he got to a point where he was
[02:00:50] unacceptable to him we had a similar thing you know that you and I were talking about with general
[02:00:56] matters and at what point you know if general matters who's so highly respected and just smart and
[02:01:11] resolute in his beliefs and and kind of unflappable so it was really nice when he got a
[02:01:18] point it I was so happy I'm like okay we got some sanity going on here we got somebody that's that's
[02:01:22] rational right very rational guy and it's at one point it's over and then you wonder okay look I know
[02:01:30] it sucked and I know you didn't like it but don't you have more influence when you're sitting in the
[02:01:35] seat that's a that's an issue that people leaders have to deal with on all different levels you know
[02:01:42] I talk about a lot and leadership strategy and tactics not a lot but I write a section about it
[02:01:46] if you're my boss and you tell me hey jockel I want you to do this mission here
[02:01:50] and I say well I don't think it's a good mission and I think you know it's gonna cause casualties
[02:01:55] or I don't think it's got a good strategic objective or and you say I jockel you do what I told you
[02:02:00] and I say but hey you know ma'am it doesn't seem like a good plan to me and you say hey jockel
[02:02:05] shut up and do it now I can either draw a line this hand and say I'm not going to do it and then what
[02:02:10] do you do you fire me you put echo in charge and echo goes it goes and does it because he's just a yes man
[02:02:14] so now but I've given up all my influence at that point which is not good there's a scene in band
[02:02:22] of brothers Dick Winners who gets ordered to do reconnaissance it's the end of the war and he goes
[02:02:29] I don't really think that's a good idea the Colonel says shut up and do it he goes okay he goes and does it
[02:02:35] they get a guy killed they come back the next night the the Colonel says I want you to do another
[02:02:40] Recon tomorrow night and Dick Winners says I don't think that's a good idea the war's almost over
[02:02:44] we lost a guy yesterday and he goes shut up and do it he and he says Roger that sir and they
[02:02:49] go to who a basement and they drink wine what do you see on the Recon we didn't see anything okay good
[02:02:56] you know he he went along with it but he still had some control and this is just a hard thing and
[02:03:02] it's it's interesting to hear your perspective of you know at some point you make a stand
[02:03:08] and that's where you decided to make a stand and obviously you lose some influence after you did that
[02:03:14] you lost some you know I don't know how many invites you got to those dinners after you did that
[02:03:18] that's probably not I know so you give up some influence but at the same time you're you're
[02:03:24] you're holding the line on what you believe in and at some point you've got to do that I mean at some
[02:03:30] point you go look told see I don't care you want me to do this mission it's a bad idea we shouldn't do it
[02:03:35] and if you got to fire me fire me yeah and maybe that's me just trying to send you a message
[02:03:40] you maybe you say or geese jocke was really serious I must really have a bad I must really have
[02:03:44] a bad perspective of what I'm trying to get this guy to do because he's never said no to me and
[02:03:47] now he's saying no to me all right jocke let's tell me your reasons again and now we can have a conversation
[02:03:52] tough tough those are tough things for leaders to do yeah and that then they're if you
[02:04:01] I would say this is especially true in politics but I think it probably applicable across the board
[02:04:08] is if you know what you are trying to accomplish ultimately what's the greater goal
[02:04:17] and your goal is not about self preservation if your goal is not selfishly motivated but instead
[02:04:27] you know how how can I serve this this greater purpose that you're obviously there to do
[02:04:34] then you're able to more
[02:04:38] unemotionally and clearly assess okay here I've got three different options here here's where this one
[02:04:44] leads here's where that one leads here's where that one leads and assess okay you know what what
[02:04:50] really ultimately what is going to help me get help get me closer to that thing that I'm trying to accomplish
[02:04:55] and yeah I've I've gone through many many iterations of this as I've made different decisions that
[02:05:02] had very serious political consequences and that especially the big ones were were very often the
[02:05:09] unpopular decision that people were kind of scratched their head like what what is wrong with her
[02:05:16] like she's she's she's going and doing things that nobody does she's going and saying things that
[02:05:22] nobody will say is she crazy or just stupid or what but if you take a step back you know really
[02:05:34] who am I accountable to and what is my purpose if my purpose is to be a part of the
[02:05:43] to seek the approval of of the elite in Washington then I would have made completely different decisions
[02:05:50] completely from from the get go and I would have done very different things but if my accountability
[02:05:58] is to and it is and and has been to the people who elected me to serve if my accountability is to
[02:06:05] our brothers and sisters in uniform both of those who continue to serve those who've laid down
[02:06:10] the uniform and those who have paid the ultimate price then I'm making my decisions through
[02:06:16] different lens and a different context then folks are used to in Washington and it's not to say like
[02:06:25] hey I'm just going gangbusters and I'm going to go run through a freaking brick wall no matter what
[02:06:29] the consequence and it it is being clear I'd about okay here here here are the here are the
[02:06:33] potential ramifications to this and sometimes they are known and sometimes they are an unknown factor
[02:06:38] but ultimately these major decision points that I have come across do the right thing if you don't
[02:06:50] if you don't know and you're not sure and all these it like ultimately do the right thing
[02:06:55] because it's the right thing and even even as you may get you know the you know the political
[02:07:06] fire or the the negative consequences or these other things like ultimately whether it takes a
[02:07:11] little time or it takes a long time doing the right thing is always the right thing and I'm you know
[02:07:16] I'm I'm able to know that wherever my path goes I've done my best to make that best decision
[02:07:24] when faced with hard right easy wrong the I used to tell my guys if you're doing the right
[02:07:34] things for the right reasons you we will win in the end exactly so if we're doing the right things
[02:07:39] for the right reasons we'll win in the end now what's interesting about this is you know you
[02:07:45] on certain occasions to some extent you didn't play the game right and as you just said you
[02:07:50] played the game sometimes and you did which had to do and form those relationships and then
[02:07:53] sometimes you didn't play the game and this is what's interesting and that this is where the
[02:07:59] future's unknown where does that lead if you were doing the right things for the right reasons which you were
[02:08:04] ultimately you'll win in the long run wait I don't know what that looks like yet right at some point
[02:08:10] I know it's like a big gamble right because we could paint an entire different picture of
[02:08:17] Tulsi that went to Washington played the game said the right things vote the right votes not at the
[02:08:22] head and you'd be in a different spot than you are right now you'd be you could potentially I mean
[02:08:28] from your trajectory when you look at you in 2000 as I when you showed up 2012 when you showed up in
[02:08:34] 2012 your trajectory was steep and like you said you checked various boxes that needed to be checked
[02:08:43] and if you would have played the game that whole time you could be in a position right you know
[02:08:46] you could be president right now you could be president right now having conformed to what you were
[02:08:53] being told to do now we don't know where this actually ends up right because it's it's 2020 we
[02:09:00] don't know where this ends up maybe people will be listening to this in 2039 or whatever now we go oh yeah
[02:09:05] jacco call that jacco call that you do the right things that are right reason to look at how we
[02:09:10] turned out that that could potentially happen but of course you know a bunch of other things you have
[02:09:14] too but it's it's something that we have to struggle with as leaders doing if but if I still believe
[02:09:21] this and I tell people this all the time if you're doing the right things for the right reasons you're
[02:09:25] going to win in the end in the end you are going to win it might take years it might take I guess
[02:09:33] it could take decades when you're talking about this these types of decisions but the other component
[02:09:38] of this is which I think in my just just from sitting here looking at you as you're talking about this
[02:09:44] you every day have to look yourself in the mirror and at a certain point you say I'm not going to
[02:09:54] do that and again look there's I always tell people play the long take play the long game thanks
[02:10:01] strategic I tell people I would say when people ask me oh I've got some situation at work and
[02:10:05] I brought this to me do this all the time I'd give the I give the best play the game oh tell
[02:10:10] see wants me to do this paperwork and she's been yelling at me to do it and he doesn't make any
[02:10:14] sense for me to do this paperwork I tell you do the paperwork play the game build a good relationship
[02:10:20] with all three so you can actually talk to in the future and explain why that paperwork doesn't
[02:10:23] make sense right play the game until you get to a point where you got to look at yourself in the mirror
[02:10:30] and you can't and then you're not doing the right thing and you're not doing it for the right
[02:10:36] reasons and you got to make a different decision yeah yeah I that that's exactly right and
[02:10:44] in order to do that it's it's being able to have not lost your foundation and your ground
[02:10:52] in this so that you have the ability to be introspective and to know what actually matters versus
[02:11:01] the things that that that don't really matter which help you determine you know which battles
[02:11:07] am I going to pick to fight and also what what is what is winning how do you define winning
[02:11:16] is it is it a specific title or is it a specific position or when you say do the right things for
[02:11:25] the right reasons and at some point in time sooner or later you're going to win for me in my case
[02:11:33] that that's that is 100% true I think what maybe maybe is not obvious to people is
[02:11:44] winning is not becoming president of the United States winning is not becoming a United States senator
[02:11:50] or a member of congress or an ambassador or whatever pick pick the job pick the crappy job
[02:12:01] you have a different perspective than most people in Washington who live their lives from college
[02:12:07] to try to strategically plan their lives to get these jobs except for the fact that you know winning
[02:12:16] you know look if you're the president you have a massive you have the most amount of influence that
[02:12:19] you could possibly have I used to tell that to these young seal officers it's like oh you're going to
[02:12:25] kiss ass to get promoted well if you kiss ass quote to get promoted guess what you can take
[02:12:30] it better care your troops the which is why you're here right that's why we're here to take
[02:12:35] care of our team be able to accomplish the mission so sometimes it's like there those those are
[02:12:40] aligned winning when I'm a platoon commander instead of a E5 and a platoon I have more influence
[02:12:48] over that situation so I can do a better job of the mission I can do a better job attacking the
[02:12:52] enemy and I can do a better job of taking care of the guys that work for me that's all good and you
[02:12:57] know what I had to sit through some meetings I had to nod my head and I had to support my
[02:13:00] whatever commanding officer or my master chief when they told me to do something that didn't
[02:13:04] make quite make sense but I did it why not so I could get promoted that's the big difference not
[02:13:09] so I could get promoted and I never did it it was as you know for me it was such a it made my career
[02:13:14] so much easier because I never was worried about getting promoted I never cared if I got promoted
[02:13:21] and it actually helped it helped because I was doing the right things for the right reasons and
[02:13:24] my boss is what look at me and say like yeah this guy cares about the guys and he wants to get
[02:13:28] the mission done let's get him promoted yeah I wasn't doing it to get promoted it's just gonna happen
[02:13:32] if you're doing the right things for the right reasons yeah so there's a weird dichotomy there
[02:13:36] no winning isn't necessarily getting promoted or becoming the president or whatever the case may be
[02:13:41] but if you're looking to have the most amount of influence that take care of your people and your
[02:13:45] troops and your country and your nation that's a really good spot to be in and that that the order
[02:13:50] of that I think is the most important thing because too often in politics people get so attached to
[02:13:55] the position or the title and their entire identity is wrapped around that whether they have it or
[02:14:01] it is their ambition to achieve that position or title that they forget that the real goal is being
[02:14:07] in a position of impact and influence where you can serve and make that positive impact and that's
[02:14:13] where for me even from when I ran for state house through the different political positions that I've
[02:14:18] had like I had no issue and no qualms about walking away from what was beginning what was the
[02:14:25] beginning of some would say would be in a lustre's political career as as a 21 year old elected
[02:14:30] the state house when it came for that decision point are you going to stay or you're going to go I went
[02:14:37] because I wasn't losing anything and like people are going to give up this political career you've
[02:14:43] only just begun I'm not giving up anything I am only choosing at this point to serve in a different
[02:14:51] way and I think that's where when you look at when I've thought about okay well you know winning
[02:14:57] is being in that position of impact and influence and and maybe at some point it does take that form of
[02:15:05] you know serving an elected office in a high position where I can execute on that or maybe it
[02:15:10] takes a different form or a different shape you know for the time being or for whatever it is
[02:15:15] it's staying the order of that staying focused okay this is the goal and the position and the
[02:15:22] platform that I may have at a different point in time to accomplish that goal doesn't change the goal.
[02:15:28] Did you underestimate the power of the swamp?
[02:15:32] Well maybe a little bit but I think even yeah I would say yeah I mean the power of
[02:15:52] the political infrastructure and the party system and how much money
[02:15:56] you know they're limits like if I'm well if when I ran for present around for Congress they're
[02:16:03] limits like if you wanted to make a political contribution to me you know the limit changes
[02:16:08] every election but let's say it's $2,000 that's all you can give. There's no there's no real
[02:16:15] limit to what you can give to either political party so if you wanted to write a $2,000 check
[02:16:21] you could do that no problem and so if you look at the the balance of power that gives the political
[02:16:27] parties a heck of a lot of power to to leverage over a specific candidate or specific and
[02:16:37] combat and to use as the use in the power plays that are you so that that was something that
[02:16:44] that I came into and I think was was unexpected. So just to clarify this I can give
[02:16:50] $2,000 to Tulsi for Congress but I can give $2 million to the Democratic now or $200 million
[02:16:59] or whatever. And therefore the party has that money. Yes. And now they can go all
[02:17:06] it out to the people that are playing with the program that are playing the game. And it's a
[02:17:13] little surprising to you who was a little surprised that how much control they had.
[02:17:18] And and seeing it play out literally on the house floor when votes are
[02:17:26] votes are happening or what about what happened. It's like hey where is this member of Congress?
[02:17:33] I heard he or she is thinking of voting with Republicans we need to find them and
[02:17:40] talk to him and get him in line. And they say and they're actual jobs like I don't you
[02:17:47] have you seen House of Cards? Yeah, you're fine don't worry about it. But it's featured in this
[02:17:55] show House of Cards the the the main character he kind of starts out he's a member of Congress and
[02:18:01] he is the whip and the position is literally called the whip and that's their job is they
[02:18:09] whip votes and so if somebody's you know so I go to you and I say hey Tulsi I know you're kind of
[02:18:16] wavering on this vote but it looks like you got a tough race coming up there and Hawaii could use
[02:18:20] some extra TV advertisement don't you think? Yeah. It's like that like for real yes that's how it is.
[02:18:28] Kind of or that's how it works. It takes different sometimes it can be very direct like that.
[02:18:34] I this is so this is something that that I have not personally directly been the target of
[02:18:42] because they knew. But partially because I I got elected without any help from the Democratic
[02:18:50] Party locally or nationally. There was no fundraising help there was no hey we're going to push you
[02:18:57] you know it was a primary election and generally they don't get involved in primary elections.
[02:19:02] It's not it's not a rule that's always followed but in my case it was and because it's such a strong
[02:19:08] Democratic state generally they'll use their resources to help Democrats get elected or
[02:19:12] reelected in swing districts or Republican districts if they're like, uh Tulsi you're good like
[02:19:17] we don't gotta worry about you in my case then that also means there's no leverage from them.
[02:19:24] But I have friends who I've served with who are in those positions where you know a reelection
[02:19:29] in a congressional race like they've got a race 10 million 20 million bucks which is you know in
[02:19:35] my race I think I raised I raised about I don't know a little over million dollars.
[02:19:42] So for them there is a lot of leverage and it's used it's certainly used to to try to get
[02:19:50] you as a member of Congress to do what what is best for the party rather than what you believe is the
[02:19:56] right thing to do based on your conscience and based on how you feel you can best serve.
[02:20:00] Yeah your constituents. What's the percentage that they're able to wield that sledge hammer
[02:20:09] effectively like how much control? I mean it's it's it's it's pervasive and so that that's one
[02:20:18] example is hey you've got it you're always getting you've got a tough reelection or a tough
[02:20:22] race or a tough challenger whatever that's one approach and the other approaches people who are
[02:20:26] interested in climbing the the ladder and so you will either have a cherry opportunity place before
[02:20:34] you or maybe you won't have that opportunity presented or it'll be taken away. So you know it's
[02:20:42] kind of like you know they'll look at okay what does this person want and what do they need and how
[02:20:47] can we use that as a motivator to try to get them to do what we want them to do and so this is the
[02:20:54] imbalance that needs to be corrected in our political system where this idea of hey anybody can
[02:21:00] go and run for Congress and I know that my member of Congress is always going to go and act in my
[02:21:04] best interest as a voter has unfortunately become so twisted into this thing that is about one
[02:21:11] party versus the other party and it's always about the next election and how they can battle and who is
[02:21:16] going to win rather than how do we work together and actually solve problems and pass meaningful
[02:21:24] legislation and I you know again early on you know there were there were some Republicans
[02:21:30] Obamacare right hugely divisive issue politically that's been weaponized by both sides issue of
[02:21:38] healthcare and there were some republic we found like hey here are some easy fixes this was this was
[02:21:45] that was elected in 2012 Obamacare was passed in 2010 and so you know there were some
[02:21:51] Democrats and Republicans we started to say hey let's figure out what we can do together like
[02:21:55] we're this is we're here in Congress is why we are here and there were some easy kind of very
[02:22:03] simple common sense corrections that we could make it through legislation to this bill
[02:22:09] that are no brainers like not not controversial at all common sense no brainers exact okay sounds good
[02:22:15] good set of I like it and how that work out it turns out that both party leadership
[02:22:23] indirectly expressed opposition to this idea and what we were talking about doing
[02:22:30] on the democratic side because it would require that they would have to admit that the bill had
[02:22:36] some flaws that needed fixing and on the Republicans I'd opposed to it because if you fix
[02:22:44] Obamacare then what do you run against what do you criticize the other side for if you actually
[02:22:49] fix it in a way that it it helps people and if people start to like it then you can't raise money
[02:22:56] off of it and you can't weaponize it for political purposes and that's that was 2013 and unfortunately
[02:23:08] here we are in 2021 and it has only progressively escalated and gotten far worse far divisive to
[02:23:18] the point where as we sit here today you have the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referring to
[02:23:22] Republicans as quote unquote the enemy within the enemy within and the implications of that
[02:23:32] like the actual legitimate implications of that where is when you make that statement
[02:23:38] that you do not trust people from the opposing party broadly she's not saying hey this one person
[02:23:45] I feel is a threat to our security and needs to be reported to law enforcement that's a different
[02:23:49] story if that if that were the case we have systems in our government to do that if you think a
[02:23:54] member of Congress poses a security threat to their colleagues report it to law enforcement do it
[02:24:02] but to throw this out in a public setting I think it wasn't a press conference you said that
[02:24:07] that they are the enemy within and other Democrats saying well I don't feel safe around my
[02:24:12] Republican colleagues what you're saying is that if any member and any Democrat goes and tries to
[02:24:19] have a conversation with or reach out to or work with a Republican they are working with the enemy
[02:24:26] they are collaborating with the enemy they are now traders to who to the country to Democrats
[02:24:35] where does that then lead and how is there any possibility of healing and unifying and
[02:24:49] reaching out to get past the inflammatory divisive state that we're in okay so we got that going for us
[02:25:08] it seems like I didn't track every move that you made but certainly one of the if not at least from
[02:25:20] what I know the biggest kind of move that you made that was outside the system is when you went against
[02:25:26] Hillary in 2016 for for president is that was at the straw that broke the camera was by one
[02:25:41] yeah and that was one of those that was one of those big decision points that I had
[02:25:46] where I couldn't I couldn't map out what the actual consequences to that decision would be
[02:25:56] so you knew I knew I knew I obviously knew it was it was a serious decision that would have
[02:26:03] serious implications but exactly what those implications would be I didn't I didn't know
[02:26:09] I had different political advisors and people who you know who knew Washington and who knew me
[02:26:19] giving me very serious warning and just saying what tells you this could be the end of the political
[02:26:24] road for you potentially so just know that before you make this decision and just just to back
[02:26:31] up a little bit why the the backstory that led to my making that decision was I was still
[02:26:37] Vice Chair of the DNC at that point and as an officer of the DNC the rules say you have to be
[02:26:44] neutral in a primary election that the DNC's role is to make sure that the primary election process
[02:26:50] is executed in a fair in a fair way so that voters have the opportunity to make their decision
[02:26:58] on who they would like to be the Democratic nominee to become the president of states and so
[02:27:02] that was my like okay I'm going to make sure that I fulfill that responsibility and make sure that
[02:27:07] our Democratic process works in in this primary and I had I know plans to get involved in the race
[02:27:14] at all and there were you know there were a number of you know this wasn't the reason why ultimately
[02:27:21] made the decision but there were a number of issues that started to present themselves
[02:27:30] in seeing that the chair of the DNC at that time was making unilateral decisions about how
[02:27:37] the primary process would work that made it very clear that it would not be fair or neutral
[02:27:43] and that those the process decisions that were being made would favor Hillary Clinton over any
[02:27:49] other candidate and I and other officers of the DNC expressed privately and then
[02:27:57] our concerns and opposition a to the fact that like hey like we're off to the DNC you're asking
[02:28:03] us to attach our names to decision that you as the chair made but we had absolutely no discussion
[02:28:07] or input to it whatsoever and I'm not comfortable doing that and then when seeing there was no
[02:28:13] it was kind of like okay no like I don't care I don't care the decision's been made and that's it
[02:28:20] and then airing some of those concerns publicly for the purpose of trying to bring some accountability
[02:28:25] and transparency to the process and just to just two two examples one was limiting the initial decision
[02:28:33] that that the chairman made or the chairman made was there would only be six debates in the primary
[02:28:38] election and to me that was ridiculous like there had never been so few debates ever and why
[02:28:44] why that number of debates mattered was because of the second decision that was made which was
[02:28:48] if any candidate participated in a non-DNC sanctioned debate or forum they would be banned from
[02:28:58] participating in any future DNC debate so you'd be punished for actually seeking out opportunities
[02:29:04] to talk to voters both of those decisions seem pretty undemocratic to me while we're standing
[02:29:13] here saying hey we want we want high voter turnout we want people to engage in the process
[02:29:17] we want people to engage with the candidates but we're only going to allow six debates and if they
[02:29:22] do any debate or forum that's not one of our six then they won't be able to come and play with us at all
[02:29:30] because Hillary had such good name and recognition every one of these debates would be an opportunity
[02:29:34] for someone else to get more written name recognition yeah and challenge her track record I mean
[02:29:40] actually God forbid have a real dialogue and conversation and a compare and contrast for voters on
[02:29:47] each of you know I mean obviously Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were kind of the two primary
[02:29:51] candidates but there were a few others who were still running at that time Martin O'Malley was
[02:29:54] wanting to go for Maryland and so that that was kind of already happening but ultimately as
[02:30:03] as this process started to to begin I saw how even in these limited debate settings how
[02:30:13] little attention was being focused by the Democratic Party as well as their their corporate media
[02:30:17] partners on foreign policy and on the the qualifications that voters may look for in a commander
[02:30:27] in chief and what that responsibility meant it was just not it was you know they were talking
[02:30:35] about a bunch of other things most most things that to me like superficial political drama
[02:30:41] and theater like not issues that that really mattered a whole lot when you look at the
[02:30:46] implications on people everyday lives but as a soldier obviously for me like this is the most well
[02:30:53] it's not just as a soldier the most important responsibility that that any president has is to
[02:30:57] service commander and chief you know our constitution very clearly like I can have all the economic
[02:31:03] positions I want and positions on education and positions on health care as president I can't do
[02:31:09] anything of of great impact without working with Congress and that's I mean that that's the it's
[02:31:17] it's the check-in balance that our our founders had in mind for us which is a good thing but there's
[02:31:22] only one commander in chief and it ultimately drove me to resign as vice chair of the DNC
[02:31:32] and and in door Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton because I saw a huge gap and difference
[02:31:43] contrast between the two of them and in Hillary Clinton's very interventionist kind of war
[02:31:51] hawk war-monger track record both the secretary of state and and as a u.a. senator versus Bernie Sanders
[02:32:01] who through his time and service had proven to have more of a non-interventionist leaning
[02:32:07] and be a little bit more critical in questioning of any rush to war and I you know on a whole
[02:32:14] host of other issues I didn't you know Bernie and I agree or disagree on on a number of other
[02:32:19] issues but this was the singular issue that I made my decision on to to resign as vice chair of the
[02:32:25] DNC and endorse Bernie Sanders so that I would have a platform to start to push to be a voice
[02:32:33] to push this question and to challenge the media and to bring to voters here's the differences
[02:32:39] between the two major candidates in this primary you get to decide what kind of commander in chief
[02:32:47] uh you want and so um that was you know I I announced that decision on um Sunday show meet the press
[02:33:00] there in Washington went to the studio um didn't tell him really what I was there to announce it was you
[02:33:06] know I intentionally kept this to myself very very close hold knowing how when sestuous the
[02:33:13] relationships are between politicians and the media and attempts to try to um undermine my ability
[02:33:21] to deliver my message for myself and uh so they're probably like two people in my life who knew
[02:33:31] what I was gonna do uh went live television Sunday morning shared my decision and why
[02:33:38] and then uh you know my phone started ringing off the hook literally I'm in the car rolling away
[02:33:44] from this studio but but the most stark response I got was um and they ranged from like
[02:33:53] tell see that was a brave uh and righteous decision to like you yeah exactly and that's it was
[02:34:01] that was Sunday and then I think it was either Monday or Tuesday we had votes and went back into session
[02:34:04] in congress and and um both Democrats and Republican colleagues of mine were kind of coming up and
[02:34:11] patting me on the back and they're saying that like nice knowing you have a good after life
[02:34:19] and even even some Democrats who who had um like endorsed Obama over Hillary in 2008 early like
[02:34:28] from the beginning and who shared like hey like uh I made that decision and I was on the
[02:34:35] Clint shit list for years before I was able to dig myself out of it and tell see don't you know
[02:34:42] that she's gonna win and you're gonna be on the list and that there is a list and what that means
[02:34:49] in a practical way is you don't get your bill signed into law you don't get funding for the
[02:34:55] things that you need or that your constituents need in your district and that your efforts
[02:35:03] the reason why you're here in the efforts that you are putting forward will be will be blocked
[02:35:08] and so you're rendering yourself ineffective because she will be president and um
[02:35:16] that was that was the Washington response basically you're politically dead
[02:35:21] um you you knew that though right yeah I knew I knew I I was like I I chuckled as people told
[02:35:32] me this I was there was nothing there was nothing that I heard the morning after that did that
[02:35:36] surprise me I knew that there was a kind of feel like a badass when you walked into Congress on Monday
[02:35:43] did you cry I don't I'm not badass or did you feel like a idiot no neither neither I was I was
[02:35:49] um I was amused at like the hushed air for real right yeah for real no joke and like the sideways
[02:35:59] glances like is it okay to go and talk to her now or not and like I don't want to be you know
[02:36:07] like thought to be I don't know part of whatever she's doing like I don't know like there's all these
[02:36:12] different things and how about the fact that now like whoever told you hey now all the things you're
[02:36:18] gonna try to do are gonna get squashed you're not gonna be able to make any progress here that's a
[02:36:22] real thing and so again going back to this strategic decision making if you're trying to take
[02:36:30] here your constituents and you make the worst enemy that you can have in DC that's not good
[02:36:40] well what what I what ended up happening obviously as she did not win the election
[02:36:44] and some of those very same people who remain good friends of mine who were being honest with me then
[02:36:53] saying you're politically finished then came back to me later and said well turns out
[02:37:00] you saw something that nobody else saw at that time so you know
[02:37:06] couldows to you for standing up for your principles and what you believe in and listening to
[02:37:14] both your heart but also recognizing where people in the country are rather than
[02:37:22] listening to the echo chamber within Washington and yeah so so so at that point you got a little
[02:37:32] close back yeah yeah but it's all it's all not I have did the holder really I mean there there
[02:37:39] are there there's a unquestionable that a lot of the the challenges that I that I faced as I was
[02:37:46] running for president can be traced back to that original sin and just how deep you know yeah
[02:37:57] there there there were certainly ramifications but also it was I mean I had the opportunity to
[02:38:04] raise the issues that I ran for Congress to raise and to bring them to the forefront and to get
[02:38:08] conversation starting about you know the issues of war and peace and and when do when is it
[02:38:16] right to send our troops into battle and and what questions should we be asking as leaders in this
[02:38:23] country before we make that decision and recognize like I'm not a pacifist I'm not a piece Nick I
[02:38:31] I care and have dedicated my adult life to that that service to protecting our national
[02:38:37] security the safety of the American people I am just pushing to make sure that we have leaders in
[02:38:43] this country who recognize the seriousness of of of life and death of war and peace and
[02:38:56] when war may be actually necessary and warranted and knowing that our troops have volunteered to go
[02:39:04] knowing that that may mean a sacrificing of their own lives and all of the sacrifices that our loved ones
[02:39:09] and families make and don't think twice about it that's what we sign up for to serve our country
[02:39:17] but also knowing that sometimes the tougher decision to make is to not go to war
[02:39:25] the harder decision may be recognizing that even as there may be a problem that that
[02:39:31] we want to solve in the world that sometimes it requires more strength and courage to recognize
[02:39:40] a it's a problem we can't solve be it trying to do so would not serve our national security
[02:39:50] interests or the or the interests of of the American people and therefore recognizing that the
[02:39:56] right answer may be to do not do anything so so really that's the other part of the strategic move
[02:40:05] is strategically it's going to make you harder and it's going to make your job harder and some
[02:40:09] respects after you execute this move on on Hillary but at the same time it's going to bring
[02:40:15] these important issues to light so strategically it there's an advantage and a disadvantage
[02:40:20] yes and you wait them out and said you know what if I don't bring these subjects to light no one
[02:40:26] is going to do it I could not I could not I was not okay with sitting on the sidelines and watch this
[02:40:36] every presidential election is important there's not a single why every every
[02:40:40] effort election like this is the most important election of our lifetimes every single one is
[02:40:45] important and I could not live with myself if I had chosen to sit on the sidelines and let this
[02:40:55] whole thing play out without doing my very best to insert these most important questions and
[02:41:04] issues and contrasting of records into the dialogue and conversation so that voters would have the
[02:41:11] ability to make the best informed decision possible so then you decide you're going to run
[02:41:19] when is that that's what when do you figure that out when do you figure out when do you
[02:41:25] say to yourself you know what I need to run for president the event that triggered the event
[02:41:40] that ultimately led to my making that decision was the happened in January of 2018 and it was I'm
[02:41:49] sure you remember this echo but it was when on a Saturday morning we got a text alert sent out
[02:41:59] every cell phone in the state civil defense alarms sounding saying missile incoming to Hawaii seek
[02:42:10] immediate shelter this is not a drill and the aftermath of that where immediately we're thinking
[02:42:22] like I've been working the issue related to North Korea for a very long time for obvious reasons
[02:42:29] that North Korea is continuing to develop their nuclear capabilities they're developing their
[02:42:34] intercontinental ballistic missile range capabilities miniaturize nuclear warheads that that not only
[02:42:40] could reach Hawaii but could reach a significant portion of the mainland at that time in 2018 now
[02:42:45] they have continued to develop that and they can reach anywhere in the country but this is the
[02:42:50] scenario that's playing out get this message North Korea is sending you know a nuclear missile
[02:42:58] to us which means we have 15 minutes to live I was in DC when this happened
[02:43:11] all of my loved ones my family everyone is in Hawaii and
[02:43:15] what happened there was absolutely terrifying where you know there there was a video that came
[02:43:27] out after was an iPhone video that this this father took as he lowered his little eight-year-old
[02:43:34] girl by having she was about eight years old down a manhole telling her that this is the only place
[02:43:41] you'll be safe and with the camera saying like if I don't make it you know at least I want you to be
[02:43:49] okay there's countless countless stories of people that I heard from after this event happened about
[02:44:00] about what they went through in you know there was a guy who he had like he had one of his kids
[02:44:06] that was in town another kid that was on the west side of the island and in why and I and he was
[02:44:11] somewhere in the middle and in that moment got that message trying to decide which am I going to
[02:44:18] drive to town or drive to why and I which of my kids am I going to try to get to to spend those
[02:44:24] last minutes of my life with you know mothers going in the bathtub like seek shelter everyone's
[02:44:33] look where do I go friend of mine he's got like a ton of kids I don't know six or seven kids
[02:44:37] he just started driving to the mountains like I just got to go find a cave somewhere and but
[02:44:43] but there was no shelter there's no shelter and so you got this fancy alert system and like okay
[02:44:50] it's blasting out seek immediate shelter there is there is no shelter what what ended up happening
[02:44:55] in those minutes that followed for me as soon as I got that notification on my phone I'm in DC I
[02:45:01] like like it's a holy shit what is happening I need to figure out what's happening and so
[02:45:09] I just started like going through okay I know that I can probably try to reach Indo-Paycom like
[02:45:15] command cell I don't have they don't bring cell phones in the building so that's the problem
[02:45:20] I ended up the first person I called was our state-adjust in general who I knew if something was
[02:45:26] happening he was going to be at that civil defense command and he would obviously know
[02:45:30] and so I called him and I said what's going on he's also my boss in the national guard
[02:45:38] so you know do you will had it there but I called him and I said what's going on and very quickly
[02:45:45] he said it's a false alarm I said I'm gonna put this out publicly you're telling me this is a
[02:45:52] false alarm and he said somebody pushed the wrong button false alarm said there's no missile
[02:45:58] command no missile coming in so I immediately hung up with him typed out a tweet in big block
[02:46:05] letters this is a false alarm I have confirmed with authorities there is no missile incoming
[02:46:12] and that tweet was the first public notification that went out that let people know
[02:46:21] what was going on but you know I just I was on the phone constantly I was calling new stations
[02:46:26] radio stations you know people were calling me and I just literally I was just like false alarm click
[02:46:31] false alarm click just trying to get let people know what was going on and there's a whole other
[02:46:36] you know like incompetence thing like there was no official notification to the public coming from
[02:46:41] the state government until 38 minutes after that initial alert was sent out and that was a
[02:46:47] that was a whole other issue but the thing that led me ultimately to make that decision like to
[02:46:51] start thinking about I need to run for present is because of what everyone went through and
[02:46:56] realizing that you can have this fancy alert system and I'm sure the governor and other people
[02:47:01] are all bunker down somewhere safe but there's no safety or shelter for anyone else and ultimately
[02:47:11] the fact that people the fact that this is a real threat that exists
[02:47:18] and there are others that politicians have created or escalated through political rhetoric
[02:47:32] of heightening tensions with nuclear arm countries, of spurring a nuclear arms race
[02:47:41] and knowing like okay you know that I'm sure there's probably some some mechanism or system in place
[02:47:47] to protect them and their families but what about everybody else in the country people who
[02:47:54] I mean look I mean nuclear war ends in other complete destruction of of the world ultimately
[02:48:01] and having gone through what we went through I wanted to be in a position to do two things
[02:48:10] by running for president I could raise this issue and bring it to the forefront because
[02:48:15] nobody was talking about it maybe there was a day of you know CNN coverage or whatever on what
[02:48:21] happened in Hawaii but then it was it was completely dropped and forgotten there was no like
[02:48:25] hold on a second so wait North Korea has these capabilities they're continually increasing
[02:48:32] this threat is real there is no shelter like if we get attacked then it's kind of it's game over
[02:48:39] what what's being done about this by the leaders and that none of that happened at all
[02:48:43] even in the aftermath of something that was you know terrifying and in such a real way
[02:48:52] and so to be able to address these issues and and the existential threat that we face that comes from
[02:49:00] that continued advancement towards the the brink of nuclear war that that that we're on
[02:49:06] and if elected to be in a position as commander and chief to begin to walk us back away from that
[02:49:14] brink and to actually do something about it to deescalate these tensions to actually work through
[02:49:19] the kinds of negotiations and treaties that previous presidents like you know Ray Yan and JFK did
[02:49:25] when they recognized the seriousness of what happens when you when you are in a cold war and when you
[02:49:32] have nuclear armed countries who either intentionally or accidentally can spark a nuclear war that
[02:49:39] would would result in the end of of humanity on this planet and that was that was the driver
[02:49:48] for me to make that decision to run and unfortunately I very quickly found out that
[02:49:58] neither the media nor the politicians were interested in talking about it or anything that really
[02:50:08] mattered that it was it was about who's saying bad things about who which candidate is you know
[02:50:22] who looks cool who's likeable who's all of these superficial things but whether it was on the debate
[02:50:29] stage when I raise these issues or in interviews with reporters one on one or I mean I talked about
[02:50:39] I talked obviously talked about these issues every day multiple times a day town hall meetings
[02:50:45] that reporters covered or were present for at least with the intent to cover what happened there was
[02:50:52] no interest in in talking about this specific issue about the existential threat of nuclear war
[02:51:00] and what how we got here and where we need to go to prevent it what to speak of of other issues and
[02:51:07] and that was that was the most frustrating those most frustrating thing about about running for
[02:51:13] president was the realization that even as a candidate for president of the United States
[02:51:19] the ability to bring such an issue as serious as this to the American people was so easily
[02:51:27] squashed by the corporate entertainment media and the politicians who benefit from them
[02:51:36] corporate entertainment media that's a good name for the news it's more accurate than news
[02:51:46] so you said you realized very quickly that that no one wanted to hear about this stuff like
[02:51:53] when you say very quickly how long did it take before you looked around and said wait a second
[02:51:58] because I remember hearing about you I mean maybe it was on rogan um I I forget but I remember thinking
[02:52:06] oh you know that's cool and it seemed to me wow what I said wow what a what a viable candidate that's
[02:52:12] interesting and I remember seeing some polling and you were at like 2% and I said oh that's kind of
[02:52:19] weird that's not a very big number at all I was kind of surprised and then maybe that was early on
[02:52:25] but at some point you know you were on rogan again or I saw you in a debate or something and I
[02:52:30] remember thinking oh I'm gonna check that out again she got to be at 30 or 40% now because the
[02:52:36] people that I know are kind of talking about her and I'd look and you'd be at 2% and I was kind
[02:52:42] it was very strange to me that you couldn't get you you weren't getting any traction was that weird to you
[02:52:50] because I mean you did the whole Hawaii thing where you were at 2% and then you went to 20 and then
[02:52:54] you went by 22 and here you are at 2% you like I know factor I got this been here done that
[02:53:02] at what point did you say oh damn this is a little harder than I thought it was going to be
[02:53:08] and was at the same realization as the media doesn't the media and the news and the entertainment
[02:53:14] networks don't care about this stuff the way I do there there were different signs of that
[02:53:25] the first of which started on the very day that I announced officially announced my
[02:53:30] candidacy as in build the event go up on the stage deliver the speech announcing my candidacy and why
[02:53:40] and I talked about them very thing that we talked about as as where did you drive it in Hawaii
[02:53:47] what was it what where outside yeah it was it was outside at in in Wikiki and
[02:53:58] you know there were local and national media cameras there to cover it and you know a bunch of
[02:54:05] supporters and then people came out while I was giving the speech and B.C. News put out an article
[02:54:15] basically making the accusation that I am somehow a favorite of the Russians or being helped by the
[02:54:23] Russians they're talking they're saying nice things I you know it was the article was so vague
[02:54:32] and baseless and lacking in any kind of evidence to back up the claim that they were making that
[02:54:38] it was just it was just so out there and and I knew that they were doing an article because they
[02:54:43] had called and asked for a comment like a few days prior and had said you know without knowing the
[02:54:48] extent of like the the completeness of the article but they said hey you know what I what do you think
[02:54:53] about this and and and they had said okay yeah we're going to publish the article probably
[02:54:58] sometime next week maybe one day or Thursday and I think I think that my announcement was on a
[02:55:04] Saturday whatever day it was they changed their schedule for when they were going to publish the
[02:55:11] article so that it came out on the day that they knew I'd be announcing my candidacy and there's
[02:55:18] thing is like the Russians like Tulsi that's the that's the general and you know like Russian bots
[02:55:25] are like you know Russians state sponsored media or the thing was is you know I think they they
[02:55:32] said oh you know there are a lot of articles that are proving that the Russians like her something
[02:55:38] like that but when you actually go and and look at look at the articles they're citing it's it's
[02:55:46] not accurate first of all and second of all it lacks the context of like hey
[02:55:51] um they're actually just reporting that she's announced that she's running for president
[02:55:58] or uh lacks the context of well when Hillary and Obama ran against each other in 2008
[02:56:06] the Russian media reported much more favorably for Obama than Hillary and so they they chose a narrative
[02:56:13] and chose to launch it on day one of my candidacy that Tulsi would be the the the the Russian
[02:56:21] asset or the favorite of the Russians and planted that seat on day one um you know cited oh you know
[02:56:28] she's gotten donations from for campaign from people who favor Russia and you know one happened
[02:56:36] to be like a Ivy League professor and specializes in foreign policy and is talked about nuclear war
[02:56:43] for decades and you know one was a woman who was trying to promote you know diplomacy and actually
[02:56:50] building relationships between like at a grassroots level between American educators and Russian
[02:56:56] educators or business owners or whatever I mean the the it was just a it was preposterous and very
[02:57:04] transparent a transparent signal and move on day one so that yes one that it start that's when it
[02:57:10] started and then of course it it it continued to progress and escalate and I started to see
[02:57:15] both on the debate stage as the debate started to begin as well as um you know you know you
[02:57:23] nice talked earlier when you know you know you know when you're going into doing an interview like a
[02:57:26] media hit it's probably gonna be four to five minutes long and you know you go in there knowing
[02:57:33] what you want to talk about regardless of the question that they ask you because you know you got like
[02:57:37] you know two senses exactly and so this this was why I was running for president so I took
[02:57:45] every opportunity to raise it on every platform possible and there were no follow-ups there was
[02:57:51] let there was no like oh hey like let's dig deeper into this issue which is clearly very serious no none
[02:57:57] of that it was like well you know what do you think about this candidate what do you think about Trump
[02:58:02] or what do you think about this like superficial drama um and a conscious choice away from actually
[02:58:11] talking about what mattered most and ended you know Hillary Clinton weighed in on the thing when when she
[02:58:19] said that I forget the exact words but basically the Russians have chosen their candidate
[02:58:26] and without saying my name said it was me and that was then covered by the media
[02:58:31] insessantly which is like crazy it is it is and it was a signaling in of itself like why would
[02:58:41] why would the former secretary of state former presidential candidate former US senator former
[02:58:45] first lady go out of her way to place the target on me and why can't the Russian bots do better than
[02:58:55] 2% in the polls are the Russian bots are so freaking powerful why can't they run up your numbers
[02:59:01] a little bit for yeah not not not so much but it it eventually got to the point where
[02:59:11] not like the coverage that I got in that a largely being negative attempts to smear my
[02:59:16] candidacy or question my patriotism and my loyalty so out of the gate I mean is this is this a
[02:59:25] grand conspiracy where they're like oh yeah Tulsi she went against Hillary in 2016 get ready
[02:59:31] we're putting her down and what I certainly appeared that and on top of that hey Tulsi she's we can't
[02:59:37] control her this isn't going to work we don't want someone that we can't control put her down
[02:59:41] it's certainly appeared that way because that was if you look at the outcome it was the outcome
[02:59:56] that that I think they were looking for and again it started from the beginning it ended up with a
[03:00:03] total total media blackout by the end of it polling standards changed to make it so that
[03:00:13] it's like okay here they say hey you got a poll at a certain level in order to qualify for the debate
[03:00:17] and then qualify for the next debate and you know the polling standards often shifted based on
[03:00:22] where you were right like that's that's a little convenient to change it right when I start
[03:00:27] inching up in the polls a little bit more but it also just points to like the the catch 22 that exists
[03:00:34] where in America we'd like to believe that anybody can run for president anybody can run for
[03:00:40] office and that it's up to the candidate to go and make your case to voters and voters actually
[03:00:45] get to decide well in these presidential races so early on you can have very well known
[03:00:53] candidates that everybody in the country's heard of and you can have lesser known candidates that most
[03:00:58] people have like no knowledge of whatsoever well they start running these polls so early on
[03:01:05] that show lesser known candidate like myself at 1% or 2% whereas the better known candidates are
[03:01:13] pulling much higher and then make the determination well Tulsi Gabbard's not a viable candidate
[03:01:17] because he's only pulling it 2% so we're not going to really cover her very much because we don't
[03:01:22] deem her as a viable candidate and by we I mean the media and the political party and so as a
[03:01:30] lesser known candidate then you're not covered as much as the better known candidate so you don't
[03:01:33] have the opportunity to get better known and so it's this you know you're in the prophecy
[03:01:40] yeah of we know who dispersion is so we're going to keep covering it and it allows them to
[03:01:45] it allows them to decide who who they want voters to be exposed to and who they don't believe
[03:01:55] deserves that kind of opportunity to be in front of voters and so it's kind of a pre-selection
[03:02:03] a pre-primary selection before before any vote is cast you have these very powerful people
[03:02:10] within the party and within the media who who make those decisions about who gets to be heard and
[03:02:19] and who doesn't and that that was what we experienced and and it was it was such an incredible
[03:02:26] this was the thing I underestimated the most that I thought hey I can run for president and I can
[03:02:31] bring these ideas forward and yeah I'm at a disadvantage because I'm not as well known as some
[03:02:35] of these other guys but as long as I have the platform to be able to reach people all I got to
[03:02:41] do is like I all I got to do is do my best and trust that voters will make will make the decision
[03:02:46] I underestimated how very quickly and in a sustained way the media the decisions were made to
[03:02:55] to not even allow that platform to exist which left me in a pretty like a pretty helpless place you
[03:03:02] know I was yeah I can live stream my town hall and social media and I did I can reach it maybe a
[03:03:06] few more thousand people in addition to the thousand who were sitting in the room but when you look
[03:03:11] at the numbers in the country it you know when when they choose to not cover you and not allow you
[03:03:18] that platform then you know it's it's you're not only not only was I not able to to raise the issues
[03:03:27] and address the issues that that are not just important to me but important to our country but also
[03:03:35] the the smear attempts and the negative coverage left me in a very helpless and vulnerable position
[03:03:43] where I couldn't fight back I did not have you know did not have the means even if I were a
[03:03:52] billionaire which I'm not and I had a very very very skinny budget our our campaign was pretty
[03:04:01] much fueled by volunteers and I love them so much people who really believed and and set aside
[03:04:06] school or jobs or life and when worked their hearts out to help me get my message out
[03:04:13] but even if I were a well-funded candidate or a self-funded candidate and a billionaire that I
[03:04:18] could go out and purchase ads and I could go out and create by my own platform essentially
[03:04:23] if the media makes a decision to either not cover you or or to smear you and undermine
[03:04:31] therefore undermine whatever it is you're saying and doing it's it's it's um it's difficult
[03:04:40] if not impossible to beat and and I think this is so important to talk about because it is a
[03:04:47] charade of the democracy that we you believe exist in this country and it's certainly a
[03:04:54] charade of the democracy that our founders set out for us in this incredible
[03:05:01] imbalance of power and influence that's in the hands of a very few
[03:05:04] who don't have the best interests of the country at heart
[03:05:17] so we also got that going for us yeah and just to illustrate that I mean the the
[03:05:21] guy who is the CEO of CBS this is I think probably the most stark and direct example
[03:05:26] uh less moon vs his name and he this was this was um yeah I mean this this was in
[03:05:36] 20 this was in 2016 that he said something along the lines of Trump may be bad for the country
[03:05:45] but he's good for business the money is rolling in keep it up Donald Trump keep it up
[03:05:51] and his very direct statement illustrates everything that's wrong because it shows that this
[03:06:02] corporate entertainment media it's about the money it's about the profits it's about the rating
[03:06:08] with no regard whatsoever for what the consequence is for the country and for voters and for
[03:06:18] our future and that is something very serious that we as people in this country need to
[03:06:31] understand be aware of so that we can start to bring about kind of the cultural and societal shifts
[03:06:40] that will ultimately result in in change and in making it so that you know these few
[03:06:49] powerful people don't get to you serve our democracy and our voice is being the voice is that
[03:06:59] matter most in determining who we want to serve as leaders in our country
[03:07:04] so with that you see Donald Trump getting the you know getting the nod from the Republicans
[03:07:13] which many many many Republicans did not want yeah him to be the candidate at all
[03:07:20] never trumpers and and so that was a real thing they there was a lot of people that a lot of
[03:07:26] Republicans that did not want and he was Republican party was not into him for much of the primary
[03:07:31] exactly like he was totally and actually somebody when when we were on uh Rogan's together
[03:07:37] and I said something like wow you got really hammered more than enough seen anyone and someone
[03:07:41] in the youtube comments said hey idiot what about Donald Trump I was like that's a good point
[03:07:46] they hated him apparently as much as they hated you in the democratic party how is it that he was
[03:07:53] able to pull it off does it does it is the Republican party less controlling than the democratic party?
[03:08:02] I don't know the answer to that specific question but how is he able to pull it off
[03:08:09] he was very famous and he had influence they couldn't black him out they couldn't
[03:08:17] ignore him and they were making a shit ton of money off of him because with Donald Trump brought
[03:08:23] eyeballs to their screens whether it was uh Fox News who was initially I think maybe cynical
[03:08:32] or even critical of him and then shifted to like full bore pro trump or if it was CNN and MSNBC
[03:08:39] who are I think initially kind of like how was this even happening to full bore anti-Trump
[03:08:48] regardless in all of these scenarios and from the democratic parties perspective and the
[03:08:54] Republican party's perspective with Trump came money. Democrats get to be the anti-Trump party
[03:09:02] and motivate a lot of people to give money to beat Trump or people who supported Trump and
[03:09:09] members of Congress or whatever and Republicans got to raise a lot of money off of hey look
[03:09:15] they're trying to attack us and they're trying to undermine what's going on and we need your money
[03:09:20] and we need your help to be able to you know defend the party and defend the work or whatever it is
[03:09:25] so that how I think that that's what ultimately ended up and it gave Trump a lot of exposure
[03:09:38] and yeah some some of it or maybe a lot of it was was was was was negative but you look at how
[03:09:45] much the public hates politicians and how much they distrust and hate the media you know you
[03:09:51] can kind of see how generally people who are frustrated and dissatisfied with the powerful
[03:10:00] inmate whether they be in politics or the media would look at it and I friends like this like
[03:10:05] they didn't really agree with anything that Trump was saying they're like finally somebody is
[03:10:09] giving the middle finger to the media and telling him to you know shut up or whatever it was
[03:10:14] Trump had influence and he was very well known and could not be ignored. So at some point
[03:10:29] the somebody come in to somebody come from the outside that's not as brash and not as offensive as
[03:10:35] Trump and would that not be pretty would that not be easier or was it because he's so brash
[03:10:46] and because he's so freaking quotable right good or bad you know he's just going to run they're
[03:10:52] going to put they're going to put his quotes up all day long if somebody comes along that's from the
[03:10:56] outside but that is actually less brash and more calm and more rational do they say okay
[03:11:03] it seems like that would be the the perfect candidate right now someone from the outside that
[03:11:08] can actually roll in and say look this system is totally screwed up we're going to like the the idea
[03:11:15] of draining the swamp was a great quote that's got so many legs or so much legs and you know of
[03:11:22] course it didn't really happen when you look this administration it was like oh yeah more people
[03:11:27] from the swamp or love yeah exactly but but when when someone does this in a more from a better
[03:11:35] from a better like from a better position it seems like it's well this is what I'm getting at
[03:11:41] because I was going to ask you well at some point is a reach a tipping point it seems like the
[03:11:44] tipping point there it's just that someone needs to step in and say okay we are going to actually
[03:11:49] drain out this swamp we're going to actually get rid of this there's lobbies are going to get you
[03:11:53] know controls put on them we're going to do things that we're going to move this in the right
[03:11:58] direction it seems like as you said Americans a lot of Americans are looking at the political
[03:12:03] system going you got to be kidding me and look you tell me stories earlier today before we hit
[03:12:07] record it's got it's sickening it's sickening and so as that word gets out it seems like America's
[03:12:14] ready to go you know what we're done with this shit over here and and Trump was like the first guy
[03:12:20] that said hey I'll help you out and so everyone it cool sounds good you go raise hell basically
[03:12:26] if someone that says yep we're going to fix it we're going to change it I'm for change I'm going to
[03:12:31] make things it seems like we are right for that I was going to ask you will we reach a tipping point
[03:12:37] it seems like we're already there Trump was the guy that got elected based on saying hey we're
[03:12:42] going to drain the swamp people voted for him to go and do that like you said people that you
[03:12:48] knew that didn't agree with any of his politics but he was changed he was different he was going to
[03:12:52] throw it in the face of the system that's where you're ready for and it just so happens at the guy
[03:12:57] that threw it in the face of the system also threw it in the face of everybody that was around him
[03:13:01] I mean just like a grenade going off it's just people are getting hit and there's no direction to it
[03:13:07] so it seems like we're actually ready for that what's it going to take to actually get someone there
[03:13:15] that's going to run that's going to that's that the truth will come out doing the right things
[03:13:19] so the right reasons is going to win in the end someone who has the resources and ammunition
[03:13:30] capable of going to battle with the existing political infrastructure and the corporate entertainment
[03:13:36] media that that's that's the matchup because I agree you know there are there are more people who
[03:13:46] identify as independence in the country today then there are who people who identify as either
[03:13:52] Democrats or Republicans really yes factually factually I go Charles we're going to use that word yes
[03:13:59] thanks that's factually true we can look up we I mean I mean I've seen a variety and this has been
[03:14:06] trending in this direction for quite some time this is not a new phenomenon but the numbers are consistently
[03:14:11] trending towards and and maybe some some of it's generational that that you know the millennial generation
[03:14:18] did not come up identifying like my daddy was a Democrat my granddaddy was a Democrat I got to be a
[03:14:22] Democrat I think there's there's less far less of that in the millennial in post millennial generation
[03:14:30] so I think that's part of it people are looking more at issues than party I think part of it is
[03:14:34] people recognizing and being disillusioned with with both political parties as not looking out for
[03:14:41] their best interest and it's more about the party than the people so I think there's a number of
[03:14:45] of reasons for this but it is a fact that it's over 40% of the country identify themselves as
[03:14:52] independent and therefore lesser numbers who identify as well as one party or another so are the
[03:14:56] people ready for a strong leader who will come in and speak to what's in the best interest of
[03:15:03] the country rather than what's in the best interest of one party or another I would say yes without
[03:15:09] it out so then the next question is how what is necessary to execute on that what is necessary is
[03:15:20] is first of all recognizing you know where's the opposition coming from the opposition will come from
[03:15:27] the people who are benefiting off the status quo and that is the existing two party system
[03:15:32] and the the the the the entertainment media that that is in bed with them and it's not impossible
[03:15:44] it's not insurmountable but it's a pretty serious obstacle and you got to be ready to go to battle
[03:15:50] with some of the most powerful people and so it would take a lot it would take a lot
[03:15:59] and the third party thing is what do you think is that is that dead on arrival not dead on arrival
[03:16:08] not impossible very difficult because I think it was it was back and I forget I think it was the
[03:16:15] first time that Ross Perot ran for president was also in Bill Clinton was running for president
[03:16:22] and I think George H.W. if I'm not mistaken yeah I figure right at a certain point well early on
[03:16:29] though early on at a certain point Ross Perot was pulling higher than Bill Clinton and I
[03:16:35] I believe George Bush as well and that like their like what is going like how is this possible
[03:16:44] and had he continued his campaign at a certain point Ross Perot dropped out of the race
[03:16:50] and then jumped back in a little bit later and he took a big hit for that I don't know
[03:16:55] people probably like want like do not know what you want or like what what are you doing buddy
[03:17:01] but there are political pundits who say that if he had continued on he you know who knows
[03:17:09] he may have become president or he may have posed a more serious threat in the end than he did
[03:17:14] ultimately his numbers took a dive after he re-enter the race and he ended up kind of just being
[03:17:19] the perennial third party guy who stole votes right but it was after that election year that
[03:17:27] the rules started to change in making it with with agreement from both the Democrat
[03:17:34] Republican Party that made it much more difficult for a third party candidate to get ballot access
[03:17:42] just to get their names on the ballot to be included in debates just the basic infrastructure of
[03:17:54] a candidacy changed to the point where and it still it still exists today that
[03:18:00] the the bar is much higher for a third party candidate to to be heard and to be on the ballot
[03:18:07] than it is for candidates who run under one party or or another so that that that just again
[03:18:15] not impossible but from a practical perspective as well as from an exposure perspective
[03:18:24] it's a much much much heavier lift that again requires a certain strategy and a hell of a lot
[03:18:32] of resources to be able to accomplish that so how long how long were you in the race for total
[03:18:42] I think I announced in February of 2019 and I withdrew from the race
[03:18:50] I think in March February or March of I think it was March of 2020 it was it was after COVID
[03:19:03] had kind of already started I was back in Hawaii COVID had started to take a pretty firm hold
[03:19:09] maybe it was even later than that and I just it got to the point where like run locked out at home
[03:19:15] in Hawaii Congress had shut down and I knew that the most effective use of my time
[03:19:24] like the outcome of the primary seemed somewhat inevitable at that point and
[03:19:29] the most effective use of my time would be to focus on how I could best help with the response
[03:19:34] on of COVID and Hawaii and you know I was calling trying to get like and 95 masks and just trying
[03:19:40] to help with that local response in Hawaii so you what it's called dropping out of the races
[03:19:46] what it's called there's some official word for yeah no with Drew my Canada's I grew with
[03:19:51] Canada so you withdrew suspending that's the word they use suspending your Canada's you
[03:19:57] and did you feel like what the hell just happened did you feel like wasted time did you feel like
[03:20:06] man because again I remember looking at you in the polls and you know you might have gotten to
[03:20:12] 3% or 4% I could I was really surprised I was really surprised you know that you just didn't
[03:20:20] get the kind of traction again as as Joe said you're like such a kind of ideal candidate from
[03:20:28] like a box checking your a veteran your a woman you've been you've got experience you got
[03:20:35] combat deployments you're whatever not a white person you got these things that people are looking
[03:20:43] for hoppa yeah you're hopper so you got those things and it just seemed like okay
[03:20:51] it'll be interesting to watch this she's gonna climb right up this thing and you never really made
[03:20:55] that progress does that surprise you I mean in hindsight no because you because you see
[03:21:05] that you had that at that moment like going through it it surprised me that I didn't even
[03:21:13] have the opportunity to earn it to earn the support to get that exposure however you tell me at
[03:21:20] some point you were like the number one most googled name after the first debate after the second
[03:21:24] debate what you you didn't make the third debate for whatever reason yeah I don't remember which you
[03:21:29] know I I think there was there was yeah there was a gap at some point where I didn't make one
[03:21:34] but then I made the the next I don't remember exactly what but in those first in those first debates
[03:21:40] I was the most searched candidate of the night after each of those debates which was the whole point
[03:21:47] you know hey I can go on this stage the national stage and the first debate I think had over
[03:21:51] 20 million viewers and this is the opportunity to introduce myself to the American people
[03:21:59] and the hopes that they might say hmm she looks interesting I want to know more I want to learn
[03:22:03] more and that being starting to kind of crack open the door to be able to make an impact there
[03:22:11] I think one of the other in addition to all the things that we talked about about how
[03:22:17] that opportunity really ultimately did not exist and it started with that first debate
[03:22:23] you know in advance we had set up our our Google ads account so that when people went on
[03:22:30] Google and said hey who is Tulsi Gabbard then you know our links would pop up and they would
[03:22:35] then go to my website and they could look at click issue x-yersy what do you care about biobaccount
[03:22:40] et cetera um that was the hope that that would be I would be the most Google candidate and that
[03:22:47] we therefore ready for it um Google shut down our Google ads account with no reason whatsoever
[03:22:55] at all given during the first debate it was not actually during the debate it was afterward
[03:23:02] but it was during that it was during that window of time that was the golden opportunity
[03:23:09] to capture and it was a limited window and they they just like your your count is suspended no
[03:23:18] explanation no here's what you got to do to fix it or get it you know whatever released and uh and
[03:23:25] to this day we've never gotten you know it was suspended for a certain period of time and then
[03:23:30] it was reinstated and it was not for lack of us trying to reach anybody who would answer us and tell
[03:23:36] us why and what we could do to fix it immediately so you know I mean there's I found a loss
[03:23:43] to get in this Google for that um because of because of the the impact obviously that it had on
[03:23:50] me but also but really the bigger issue that I I wanted to raise by filing this lawsuit was
[03:23:55] you've got this massive big tech company who has the power to um interfere in the public
[03:24:06] square of our democracy and you know who knows still to this day like was it some guy sitting at a
[03:24:13] computer was like man fuck tells you gathered I'm gonna punch this button and show her what's
[03:24:17] up or like who knows I don't know what happened but it happened and if it can happen to a sitting
[03:24:25] member of Congress who's running for the highest office in the land it could happen to anybody
[03:24:31] running for office anybody who's speaking out anybody being critical of whether it's big tech or
[03:24:37] government policy like whatever the motive um this is the power that they have in their hands that's
[03:24:43] incredibly dangerous in undermining the the kind of core pillars of our democracy of a having a
[03:24:52] marketplace of free ideas and voters who can you know get the information they need and ultimately
[03:24:59] make the decision that they want to make are they allowed to are they allowed to mess with like
[03:25:08] Google ad words from a political perspective so I know the words if I was running against you
[03:25:13] and I bought the ad word Tulsi Gabbard and brought it to a freaking Russian newspaper article about how
[03:25:21] they're your favorite so when I Google Tulsi Gabbard I click on the first article that comes
[03:25:25] up it shows me that you're a Russian plant can I do that in the political realm because look they do it
[03:25:31] with like I you know I I have a bunch of companies and sell a bunch of stuff and you type in
[03:25:37] jocco you know the other companies pay for that word for jocco protein and it brings to their site
[03:25:45] so if I was a billionaire and you were running against me I could be like oh cool I'll just buy
[03:25:50] Tulsi Gabbard who is Tulsi Gabbard what is Tulsi Gabbard where is Tulsi Gabbard come from and I'll
[03:25:54] just buy all those things and send them all to Tulsi Gabbard from Russia what ever else I'm going to
[03:25:58] do is that legal in the political I know it's legal in the in the free market because they do it all the time
[03:26:04] is it legal in the political side too far as I know I am not I have not come across any kind of
[03:26:12] like legislation against ad words in Google there are there are no laws or rules in place
[03:26:21] from a government perspective that that limit what these big tech monopolies can do with their
[03:26:30] algorithms and that's part of the whole issue here when we talk about big tech the monopolies the
[03:26:40] power that they have to either promote or push forward certain voices or people or ideas and
[03:26:48] silence others and they can do so while being completely legally immune from any kind of
[03:26:58] accountability through our legal system because they're private companies well because
[03:27:02] yet because they're private companies but this section to 30 provision that exists within the law
[03:27:08] that was was put in place to encourage innovation on the internet early you know decades ago when they
[03:27:19] pass that law it that gave them this legal immunity it said that they can they can remove content that
[03:27:29] they deem to be objectionable without any definition of what that is first of all whatever they want it to
[03:27:37] be whatever they want it to be and then it says whether or not it is protected by the constitution
[03:27:46] dang how I don't know who wrote that part of it probably the same to bastard that clicked
[03:27:56] delete under freaking account for six hours but to have something in there that says you internet you
[03:28:03] know service provider company you can decide what speech you deem or content objectionable or not
[03:28:12] whether or not it is protected by our constitution this is the problem that needs to be fixed within
[03:28:19] our laws today as it relates to big tech and it's a relatively there's a lot of I even I've looked
[03:28:25] at this a lot while I was in Congress and then after for obvious reasons and you know there's a lot
[03:28:30] of different proposals in different ways to kind of bite this apple but the most simple and direct way
[03:28:36] would be to take out that objectionable content just take those words out and instead you know
[03:28:48] you can say unless it is you know you you can remove content unless it is protected under the
[03:28:55] first amendment and there's legal precedence in place through various Supreme Court rulings
[03:29:01] that provide very clear kind of guardrails towards what kind of speeches protected versus what is
[03:29:09] not and that way if if we make this legislative change it would alleviate the kind of pressure that
[03:29:16] these big tech companies are under right now coming from the left and the right because then they
[03:29:22] can just say look these are the guardrails this is speech that's protected and it's going to remain
[03:29:28] on the internet and speech that's not protected then it's up to us to make that decision to to
[03:29:35] to remove it that that's that's the that that's the that's the best answer that I have come across
[03:29:40] on how to address this rather than allowing this you know I mean now we have like okay
[03:29:47] well we're going to cancel anything that's disinformation we're going to cancel anything that's
[03:29:50] misinformation we're going to you know cancel anything that we don't like or you know I mean it's
[03:29:57] it's getting worse and worse and unfortunately the direction that I'm seeing from Democrats in Congress
[03:30:03] is not towards how do we protect free speech but instead it's we need big tech to do more
[03:30:11] to shut people up who are saying things that we deem to be misinformation or disinformation or
[03:30:21] that could mislead people into believing a certain thing or seeing a certain view and it's it is
[03:30:32] you know the fact that this is happening and people don't see the danger of okay you're in power
[03:30:38] today you got Kevin McCarthy who's the head of the Republicans in the house saying I bet my house
[03:30:46] on the fact that Republicans will regain the majority in 2022 what are you going to do in the
[03:30:51] tables turn and then you've got the other guys in power saying yeah you know what we don't want
[03:30:56] Democrats to be misleading people on the internet so we're going to tweak the language a little bit
[03:31:02] and make sure that big tech silences those voices and pushes like it's it's so simple and clear
[03:31:11] how dangerous of position that we are in and that when you when you threaten the first amendment
[03:31:18] like freedom of speech a free press like freedom of religion once you undermine that what do we have
[03:31:26] in America we don't we don't have we don't have the country we don't have our country
[03:31:35] yeah we did the we did a podcast and we recorded it before Christmas but we did it on 1984
[03:31:42] I listened to that yeah and it was really weird because we just you know it's just something
[03:31:45] that I was like all the same things that are going on and I and I you know read that book many
[03:31:50] many years ago and I remembered this one part of this about the language and the importance of
[03:31:55] language and they did therefore the importance of free speech and we recorded it and then like it was
[03:31:59] Christmas time and that that podcast came out January 6th and it was kind of crazy that it came out
[03:32:08] on that just we had recorded it a month prior and you had scheduled it for that it was just that's
[03:32:12] when it's coming out so it came out January 6 then 1984 was trending and then then the tag the hashtag
[03:32:21] 1984 some some hashtag 1984 actually got shut down on Twitter it was it wasn't because of that podcast
[03:32:30] but it was just very coincidental that all that was happening at the same time but
[03:32:36] the point of doing that podcast and this is exactly aligned with what you're saying you have to
[03:32:41] allow people to communicate with each other and you know saying if you if you say something
[03:32:47] to me that's misleading I can't just it's what I started off with I just don't say shut up you're
[03:32:52] not allowed to talk I say okay well actually told me let me show you some other information
[03:32:55] that might change your mind a little bit because by the way when I just tell you to shut up
[03:33:00] I don't move your opinion at all in fact there's a really good chance that I'm just going to make
[03:33:06] you you don't stop on that and that's what's happening in the country and now which is freaking
[03:33:11] nasty and and and and actually that again interestingly as all this was happening we had had
[03:33:18] I talked to echo I was like listen man I don't know what's going to happen in the world and I don't
[03:33:24] know what's going to happen look we don't we're not on here making any inflammatory statements
[03:33:29] we're usually talking about history I said and that's cool will what that's what we're going to do
[03:33:34] but at some point people are starting to change history and I said I don't know what's going to
[03:33:37] even happen with the platforms that were on yeah like these platforms could change the way they
[03:33:42] do business and we started our own platform just to make sure we have someplace to
[03:33:48] someplace to go in the event that things take a turn for the worse and there's a bunch of other
[03:33:53] things that could happen I mean you could have some of these free platform say we're going to
[03:33:57] start charging money and start inserting ads into the middle of you know here's Jaco talking about a
[03:34:02] battle in World War II and it's heavy and crazy and emotional and some someone's going to
[03:34:09] start an ad in there like I don't want that I don't want people to have to put up with that
[03:34:15] so I don't know or do we just get someone to say look hey Jaco you talked about this part of
[03:34:21] history which you know we don't really like we think it's misinformation and pull it down
[03:34:26] that's that's a reality that could happen yeah so we have to be what did that's why we made
[03:34:33] that we made the the Jaco underground just because of that so that's the platform that you guys
[03:34:39] create it's the platform that Jaco underground calm and it's just a backup and look
[03:34:43] somebody like oh you want money I was like no we don't want your money yeah that's not what it's about
[03:34:48] but to not have a contingency plan is ignorant and so and again all that what's
[03:34:56] funny about all this is I had talked to echo about it he's kind of he said hey can you build
[03:34:59] something figure this out and he's you know working and figuring it out and eventually goes yeah
[03:35:03] you know I got it and this was before the end of 2020 this is before the end of 2020 it was a
[03:35:08] let's have a contingency plan in case something happens right and then I said you know what
[03:35:14] this is getting squirrely it's getting squirrely let's launch the contingency plan you know next month
[03:35:20] just to just to get it out there so people know what it is in case something happens and sure enough
[03:35:25] January 6 it was like boom we had it it was so coincidental but it was very it was like and I
[03:35:32] remember texting echo like well I guess this is why we had a contingency plan and then thank God
[03:35:37] it launched today because who knows where it's going to be in six months I don't know I don't know
[03:35:44] it's crazy I remember listening to that night so I don't I have not listened like I have friends
[03:35:52] of mine who have listened to your podcast from number one and then those people in my friends too
[03:35:58] yeah but like in in sequence like chronologically and like a buddy of mine got to the the
[03:36:07] I think it was episode 99 is Musashi 100 100 well he couldn't get past 99 because he didn't
[03:36:13] finish reading the book and I'm like hey Jocco just did this new show on's and I can't do it
[03:36:18] because I can't listen to 100 until I read the book so yeah I'm not one of those people
[03:36:26] I'll jump around I'll jump around like okay what am I in the mood like what am I in the mood for
[03:36:34] wait am I in the mood for dark depressive war am I in the mood for human atrocity where am I
[03:36:40] and I'll tell you a funny story about that in a second but I went straight for that 1984 and I don't
[03:36:48] remember what actual day it was not January 6 but it was in the days after and I I wondered then
[03:36:56] it when you had recorded that because it was literally addressing everything that we were seeing
[03:37:03] play out right right before us as far as the warning signs and the dangers of this is where
[03:37:09] this is where you end up once you allow for this kind of control and once we as people accept it
[03:37:23] but little sidetrack funny story and I'll show you the video after because we'll take me
[03:37:30] a minute to dig it up but it won't surprise you to know that on the presidential campaign trail
[03:37:35] sleep was hard to come by for me and for two reasons one was just a factor of time in the day but
[03:37:42] also it was tough for me to um tough for me to turn turn everything off and actually just get like
[03:37:52] I'm not even talking about hours I'm just talking about just some a good slice of good quality
[03:37:56] rest in sleep um we were in New Hampshire in the middle of winter and there was a rare opportunity
[03:38:05] where I got to take a nap and we'd like rented a like an Airbnb or something like that and um
[03:38:11] so I took a nap and my husband took a video of me taking a nap because he walked in the room
[03:38:19] and I'm lying there and I'm asleep and I'm all bundled up under the covers and I got my phone
[03:38:24] sitting on my um on the top of the covers and I was listening to jaccopodcast with a guy from the
[03:38:33] French foreign legion and I'll show you the video because I am dead asleep and uh my husband came
[03:38:43] and he has the camera going picks up my phone looks at and the reason I remember this is because
[03:38:49] this was on February 11th, February 11th, 2020 and it just so happened that it popped up on my phone
[03:38:57] on February 11th of this year as like the memory thing or whatever and I was debating sending it to you
[03:39:03] and I told my husband I was like we didn't get the wrong idea and think I'm like boarded at
[03:39:09] the spotcast and he's like no what it showed was like I was able to completely tune out the noise of
[03:39:17] of what was going on in my mind of the day to day and and be able to kind of be transported to a
[03:39:23] different conversation and topic and and all this other stuff but it was a great podcast that I
[03:39:29] did end up finishing but you gave me the gift of some really good sleep as well. The soothing
[03:39:36] place of jaccopod talking about war can send anyone to sleep. I don't know what that says about me
[03:39:42] you're a little too serious. Anyhow. I remember when you dropped out of the race and you
[03:39:55] endorsed Biden and I remember thinking because again I didn't know a lot of these things that
[03:40:00] you're telling me right now I knew them kind of but I still I still had some sort of naive sense in my
[03:40:06] heart that it can't be that bad and I I texted you and I said like hey are you gonna get the VP
[03:40:11] nodded because I was kind of surprised you endorsed Biden I was like well you know what oh I said oh I
[03:40:16] know what's happening she's playing the game she's gonna endorse Biden Biden's gonna get her as
[03:40:20] the VP it's on and you were like you like you like however you laugh and text you were like hey
[03:40:27] bro you're a little bit uh you're a little bit lost there. I did nothing from these people. I was like oh
[03:40:33] okay that's how. Pretty much pretty much. And then so so then you wrapped up your your career
[03:40:45] well you wrapped up this portion of your career as a politician in in that was it. We went out to DC
[03:40:52] for the last congressional session. Yeah. Packed up your locker. And you were a second was my last official
[03:40:59] day. We had to pack up the office before Thanksgiving. So uh no kidding you know we were there obviously
[03:41:07] votes going into December there was you know government's gonna shut down if we don't pass a new
[03:41:12] appropriations bill and kind of the unfortunate usual thing that happens at the end of every year.
[03:41:19] But yeah I was working out of my car like parked in front of the capital I had my computer and
[03:41:24] it's COVID so you know votes consist of seven different groups of members of Congress. I was
[03:41:31] group two. It's by alphabetical order where you were only allowed to have a certain number of people
[03:41:36] on the floor at any given time. They decontaminate the whole floor between every vote. And so when
[03:41:42] your group is called you go in cash your vote and then you leave. And so that was like a park my
[03:41:48] guy votes are called sometimes they last for you know an hour or two hours or whatever and
[03:41:53] if you've got four votes in a series then you're doing this running in and out you know four times
[03:41:58] in that series and so yeah I was you know office office shut down before Thanksgiving had to turn
[03:42:03] in everything so that they could transition and start to bring in other members of Congress and I should
[03:42:09] mention now that that I made the decision not to run for reelection to my house seat in October of
[03:42:17] 2019 when it got to the point where I had to make a decision where I would either continue my
[03:42:27] candidacy or I would suspend my presidential campaign and focus on running for reelection in Hawaii
[03:42:33] and I couldn't do both. Legally I could have but just the constraints of time and the tyranny of
[03:42:41] distance it was not I was I would end up doing a crappy job at both so that was the decision I made
[03:42:48] I you know let folks in and I wanted people in Hawaii to know that you know they were not some kind
[03:42:55] of fallback plan for me if this national thing didn't work out and that they would have the
[03:42:59] opportunity and the time to decide who they would want you know to to work for them and other
[03:43:04] candidates who who who were going to run so and that was a decision I never looked back on or regretted
[03:43:13] in any way but as a result of that yeah so things started quickly and having to shut down in DC
[03:43:19] but January 2nd was was the actual final day. Were you heading home kind of stoked
[03:43:28] that it was over or were you heading home kind of bummed out that it was over. Mixed feelings really
[03:43:35] mixed feelings again I made that decision without regret and so it wasn't any surprise that this
[03:43:41] was going to happen at this point in time but I mean I remember landing at Dolace Airport and
[03:43:49] on that last trip and as I was driving into DC like I'm not going to make this drive again
[03:43:56] as a member of Congress at least and even as screwed up as things are and as frustrating as things
[03:44:05] are and have progressively gotten it never takes away the awesomeness of that privilege of being able
[03:44:15] to serve in that in that way and you know there there are grooves have you have you been inside
[03:44:21] the state capital before the US capital when you go inside there are you know marble steps
[03:44:31] that take you up to the actual entrance to the house floor then the second floor and then the
[03:44:36] visitors gather on the third floor when you walk those steps there are there deeply worn grooves
[03:44:43] where countless other leaders from our nation's history have walked those very steps
[03:44:49] and the the it's an amazing thing to never forget those who have come before us those who will
[03:45:03] come after and how special of a privilege it is that the people of Hawaii allowed me that
[03:45:10] privilege to do my best to serve them for the eight years that I was there and that was that was you
[03:45:16] know yeah I there's so much of the political drama and just the theatrics and the
[03:45:25] all of the stuff that you just kind of got of endure in order to try to do the work that you're
[03:45:30] trying to do and and I always hated all that stuff and I know no problem at all leaving that
[03:45:37] that behind but I think the the mixed feelings and emotions part just came from
[03:45:42] just that that reflecting on the time that I've had there and honestly wishing that there
[03:45:48] there are a lot of areas and things that I wish I could have done more on that I could have
[03:45:52] you know legislation that I wish had been able to advance farther or you know it's just
[03:45:58] different things you know assessing kind of what I was able to do what I wish I was able to do and
[03:46:03] but but leaving with the sense of of peace in my heart and in knowing that you know I did my best
[03:46:17] and excited about how I can find how I will find a way to continue to serve.
[03:46:23] So you get back home to Hawaii and I know when I came back from my last deployment to Iraq
[03:46:33] I had home for I was home for like a month and one day I just like woke up on a Saturday and I kind
[03:46:42] of felt like this weird weight I felt good right I felt good and I felt like the weight was
[03:46:52] gone and I was kind of thinking about what what what why do I feel so good right now and I realized oh
[03:46:58] it's because I'm not worried about one my guys getting wounded or killed right now because we're
[03:47:02] home from deployment and it took me about a month for that to go away because it's just your
[03:47:06] instinct every time you wake up you're thinking about what's happening is everyone okay you're
[03:47:13] thinking about that all the time and I never noticed it when I was on deployment because that's just
[03:47:16] how it was it was just you know you just wake up and that's what you're thinking and it's real
[03:47:20] well after a month of waking up and oh no it's not you don't have to worry about the oh no you
[03:47:24] don't have to worry about that and eventually one day I woke up and said why don't feel so
[03:47:27] oh it's because I'm not worried about that thing I've been worried about for so long
[03:47:31] when you got home I mean the how long did it take for that to wear off the pressure the
[03:47:37] the constantly thinking about all this crap that's going on and what you need to do and where
[03:47:42] you need to move and what's the next maneuver and who's mad at you and who's happy with you
[03:47:45] and all this other crap how long did it take you for for you like oh I hope I don't wait
[03:47:51] do I have wax for my surfboard right now how long did that take not very well
[03:47:58] I was ready man but it also you know I mean just this whole COVID situation also
[03:48:08] you know I had been home a lot more than I normally would have been and working from home
[03:48:13] and having virtual committee hearings and and a lot of other stuff that was just it was a
[03:48:18] strange lead up to where the contrast wasn't so different but it was it was odd for me like
[03:48:26] it started August is when our primary elections are in Hawaii and I remember waking up on primary
[03:48:32] election day which is Saturday and Hawaii and I was like oh my gosh I don't have to go sign
[03:48:38] waving at six o'clock in the morning I can I can go surfing like this is a weird feeling
[03:48:47] because I had held elected office for the previous 10 years I'd been on a ballot every single
[03:48:52] election for the previous 10 years and so that was that was strange that was a really weird
[03:48:58] thing that was felt unnatural to me and then you know similarly with with the general election
[03:49:06] but yeah I was I had no issue with that transition and yeah went on just to take full advantage
[03:49:20] of being home and knowing that really a lot of it was being able to regain control over
[03:49:31] how I spent my time and have to to no longer have those very immediate political factors
[03:49:44] playing into decisions that I'm making and just to just to be for the first time and a long time
[03:49:55] not have not been constantly jet lag that was something I didn't realize took such a toll for
[03:50:01] eight years I'm going back and forth two or three times a month between Hawaii and DC five or six
[03:50:05] hours difference every time plane rides are long with that was not nice whatever I can it's playing
[03:50:10] ride but you know like like I can actually like get a schedule happening and stick with it
[03:50:18] and not be up at two o'clock in the morning because it's eight in DC and then you know go to sleep at
[03:50:24] six because it's midnight I guess just you know it was just just basic like simple life things
[03:50:29] like I like to cook like I could actually like hey like I can go grocery shopping and cooking and
[03:50:34] not have to worry like is the food gonna rot by the time I have to leave and then come back it's just
[03:50:38] like simple little things it's it's nice so let's get into what you're settling into now
[03:50:46] the dust is settled and you're able to buy groceries cook them before they rock you're able to
[03:50:54] serve train get on a schedule but obviously that's not what you're gonna do for the rest of your life
[03:51:01] yeah what else is going on what else you got going on in the world so I am so I'm still serving in the
[03:51:09] Army reserves I have I move from the National Guard to the reserves and transition my branch to civil affairs
[03:51:18] awesome which is often called kind of the the warrior diplomat service and yeah it's it's fantastic I
[03:51:32] am it's it's been a great move and one that's focused on building relationships and kind of kind of
[03:51:38] write my life something I've been interested for a long time that that I never pursued because
[03:51:42] it doesn't exist within the National Guard for obvious reasons it's a National Guard focuses domestic
[03:51:47] mission first but civil affairs is 98% of civil affairs forces in the United States Army live
[03:51:56] within the Army reserves there's the remaining whatever 2% is basically lives on on Fort Bragg as
[03:52:05] part of the the unconventional special forces community and so yeah I'm appreciating the training
[03:52:14] the experience and also some of the missions that that have already been able to serve on there
[03:52:18] I as as kind of a direct result of everything that we talked about with my experience with the
[03:52:27] the mainstream media and being filtered into you know or limited to soundbites
[03:52:37] there I'm willing us to go in depth or even really cover any real issues serious issues and just
[03:52:43] the caricatures that they they create I am launching my own show where I will have the opportunity to
[03:52:52] really speak directly to people in an unfiltered way and an unlimited way both both about a lot
[03:53:01] you know some of these issues that we've talked about and and have conversations with people who can
[03:53:04] shed light and bring their expertise or experience on them but also just be able to
[03:53:10] have a platform where I can take some of those experiences that I've had and I'm sure you've
[03:53:18] had the same because I've seen it in the military I've seen it in politics where whether it's
[03:53:23] traveling to different parts of the country or traveling to different parts of the world
[03:53:28] there's there's so much more that we have in common as people than is often focused on or
[03:53:38] that we even we may may realize and so I look forward to being able to have that platform my show is
[03:53:44] called this is Tulsi Gabbard just because it is just me and and use that as as an opportunity to be
[03:53:54] able to fill that gap or or to provide what the mainstream media and the corporate media is not offering
[03:54:05] to people and and that I found there's there is there's a lot of hunger for that for real
[03:54:11] conversation whether it's with people you agree with or or to have a dialogue you know I I want
[03:54:16] to be able to have people on my show who represent different views on an issue and who are interested
[03:54:21] in having a respectful conversation about it and why you hold one view why do you hold the other view
[03:54:27] where is their common ground where is their irretractable differences where where do you draw the line
[03:54:32] and and I think being able to provide this platform I hope will result in more people thinking like
[03:54:43] hey maybe I can start talking to my neighbor who voted for the other guy or the other party and we
[03:54:49] haven't really talked for like a year because of it but maybe we should just like start the conversation
[03:54:54] and see where it goes and that it's okay and that we in America should be encouraging civil discourse
[03:55:01] and dialogue and encouraging when we talk about what we have to protect freedom of speech what is that
[03:55:10] mean well well you know and and how do you do it like let's start with speaking sharing our ideas
[03:55:20] and not as as you started this whole our conversation today not in a way that says I'm right
[03:55:27] you're wrong I have to be heard you don't get to be heard but in a way that that we don't see
[03:55:34] now where if if you believe in something you hold a view that you feel is important strong and
[03:55:40] and communicate that also recognize that not everyone may share that view for whatever reason
[03:55:46] maybe they have a different background a different experience and one that you may not have
[03:55:51] and that the more we can encourage this kind of exchange the stronger we are as a society
[03:55:58] and we don't lose by having a great platforms for people to share them and that that's the
[03:56:08] biggest difference between what we're seeing today versus what I believe our founders envisioned
[03:56:15] for us where somehow we've come to a place where the powerful people in this country think that
[03:56:22] it's it's really a sign of insecurity where if those who hold different views are allowed to
[03:56:29] air them then somehow you'll lose which means maybe you're not confident that what you're
[03:56:39] offering is going to quote unquote win or convince people that it is a superior idea yep
[03:56:46] it plays out leadership strategy and tactics I talk about this you know if you if I'm in charge
[03:56:52] and told you you say hey hey jocco I don't think we should do it like that and my responses
[03:56:56] shut up and do what I told you to do I don't look strong no I look weak yeah I look weak if I
[03:57:02] say well tell see how do you think we should do it and I listen to your idea and I incorporate
[03:57:06] some of your idea into the overall plan because you're able to convince me because you had a different
[03:57:10] perspective than I did you'll see you'll look at me and think oh I really like working with working
[03:57:15] for jocco I really like working with jocco because he's listening to what I'm saying and all of a
[03:57:21] sudden we're coming up with actual better solutions by the way it's not like it's oh I'm doing
[03:57:26] this to appease to all of you right now so she'll you know work hard for me no she's actually got
[03:57:30] a presentation to me that actually makes more sense we're going to use it yeah it's we're trying
[03:57:34] to get some more so this is a podcast your new your new show yeah it'll be you know available
[03:57:40] on all the podcast platforms or anything we're also doing video so I I I I talked to you some time
[03:57:50] ago and ask some questions about how you launch a podcast and such and one of the things you
[03:57:56] told me about was consistency is key both of you that's that's a control that's that's a control
[03:58:00] as a question I just echoed echo Charles's advice on that well the message was received and so
[03:58:06] what I'm doing is so so soon within within the next few weeks but I'm recording a number of
[03:58:13] shows to have in the bank to make sure that you know hey I got to go away training for a couple
[03:58:18] of weeks that we're not gonna we're not gonna skip a beat so how long is the show have you recorded
[03:58:24] somewhere I have yeah you know I there no real time limit but right now they're about not
[03:58:29] like hour and a half ish you're not going to go psycho four hours I'm not a follows to it but
[03:58:38] no no rules no rules and I think that's that's an old thing about it so is that the main focus
[03:58:43] of your effort right now it is yeah you're gonna launch this show and I think probably by the end
[03:58:49] of this month it's what I'm aiming for awesome so where can people find you people can find me at
[03:58:56] Tulsi Gabbard on all the social media platforms and also on my website Tulsi Gabbard.com
[03:59:06] there's there's a few different things that that I'm looking to do there updates and
[03:59:10] and information and I've moved it away from what it was traditionally which is a political campaign
[03:59:15] website and and really focusing more on how we can build communities and conversation
[03:59:22] uh in our in our society I don't care if you're Democrat we public an independent I don't
[03:59:27] care if you voted for Trump or voted for Hillary or whatever none none of that should matter
[03:59:32] as we come together to to rebuild bridges focused on how we collectively as Americans can
[03:59:45] work together for the future of our country
[03:59:48] legit echo channels yes that seems like a good place to wrap this this session maybe this a
[04:00:01] good place to wrap up this session sure Tulsi's obviously been charging hard for
[04:00:07] well since you were 16 years old as water woman which again we will be so real reskowing
[04:00:13] the net for that she's been on the path echo Charles and I'm thinking we should be on the path too
[04:00:20] what what suggestions do you have hey when you go to the grocery store people like stop
[04:00:26] you a lot still in Hawaii definitely how yeah they do that food land which is interesting because
[04:00:31] I say I know you you're water woman I don't know where those kids are now
[04:00:38] I do not remember you where's your cape yeah exactly it's still there it's the same
[04:00:49] down cape yeah on on koai like when you'd see the mayor yeah wherever you know star market for sure
[04:00:57] um yeah you know stop and be like hey you know so would imagine if someone had like something
[04:01:01] you know some thing they want to address they they wouldn't hesitate to stop because you're right
[04:01:06] there it happened most recently um I was out surfing the reef near the mokulu islands and
[04:01:12] the east side of oahu and the surf there only goes off like it's only really good when there's no
[04:01:19] wind and there's swell obviously and it's it's a long it's like three quarters of a mile
[04:01:24] paddle from shore out there but it happened most recently they're like usually it's like
[04:01:29] someone will paddle up be like where do I know you from and then and then like one
[04:01:36] thousand and then it eventually like oh yeah I am told oh my god that's what I thought and then
[04:01:40] word in the lineup travels pretty quickly and the last time I was just a couple of weeks ago
[04:01:44] the ways were really like they stayed out for four hours and um people just like hey don't see
[04:01:51] guys on stand up words looking down at me on my surboard and talking stories like oh what this
[04:01:56] is what it's so it's it's cool I like it yeah imagine so you go to sandy beach
[04:02:02] um I have been I generally stay away I don't want to threaten like my life by
[04:02:09] body search for a break do you oh yeah those are yeah yeah back in the day back in the
[04:02:21] day all right all right we work you know are we surfing yeah snowboarding
[04:02:29] snowboarding oh I skis snowboard but echo Charles has recently become highly engaged in snowboard
[04:02:37] shredding like it but we are working out and training for various things so
[04:02:47] I was pretty stoked when you were running and you'd put like um whatever videos of you do in
[04:02:51] squats yeah and I'm like come on don't growl can we get a couple percentage points of increase on
[04:02:59] just doing burpees I was given credit I was like yeah I kind of leave on leaning in your
[04:03:05] direction to see the new burpees it's all good in the polls yeah and that's all you say okay
[04:03:09] in the polls people watching that saying oh there's totally doing burpees hey let's at least throw
[04:03:13] a dog a bong right come on let me earn it with some burpees yeah thank you guys I didn't really
[04:03:20] see much burpees by Joe Biden or you mean yeah I didn't see Joe Biden doing any burpees yeah nobody else
[04:03:28] nobody really else kind of got on the the fitness kick yeah crazy all good nonetheless we're gonna
[04:03:35] stay on the path so through the path we may need supplementation I would suggest supplementation
[04:03:41] don't worry jocquest I believe in that it's true yeah history there you go so here you go you got
[04:03:47] joints that need attention sometimes especially when we get older we need younger is this the
[04:03:53] collective we it's far okay I'm not I'm not I'm not against it but for those of us who are you
[04:04:03] know we want to get something that helps in the routine supplementation for joints protein
[04:04:09] brain body all this stuff so what do we got joint warfare joints krill oil joints discipline and
[04:04:16] discipline go brain and body how does that discipline go go this this is good I this is the first
[04:04:23] time I'm trying the discipline go jocco pomer drink very good tasty very good no sugar in that yeah
[04:04:32] that's sweet with the monk friend see I use monk fruit like in my protein shakes and stuff like
[04:04:37] no what's up yeah man to sweet to it to sweeten it yeah because you you get you get you get the good
[04:04:43] natural like healthy sweetener without like the carbs of like maple syrup for example yes who just made
[04:04:50] the the clip of the week which maple syrup is my my go like I would only eat pancakes to have maple
[04:05:02] syrup really but you know I can't did you get any maple syrup from peat up in of the main oh
[04:05:08] peat come on yeah he's out there and he used to do it himself but now you know it's just like
[04:05:15] friends and it's real maple syrup you can go up there oh man there's trees are running
[04:05:21] that was and sorry echo I'm messing with your jam here man but it's more than cool one of the coolest
[04:05:28] experiences well there were many but one of the coolest was when I stopped in freedom new hamper
[04:05:33] and went to a sugar shack met with the three generations of family who have passed down from
[04:05:41] you know father to child and got to see the whole thing we went up to the trees saw the taps
[04:05:49] came down saw the whole process and then of course like sampled the goods I like maple
[04:05:56] syrup is it ever since I've been a kid like those little maple leaf candies and you're done finished
[04:06:02] I was up in the main talking to Pete and he's like a sugar addict he obviously can't eat it that's
[04:06:08] why but he he was saying he would take little pencil box you know the pencil box you
[04:06:13] have when you're a little kid he would fill that with sugar cubes and hide it underneath his bed
[04:06:19] and at night when he'd go to bed he'd put like a little arca at it that's that's like level
[04:06:26] I'm like bro what is wrong with you and then he started like going into a different realm
[04:06:32] mental and he goes he goes bro if you ever tried you he's talking to me about yeah like crazy
[04:06:39] you were when were you were talking about that right unlike um I think yeah one of the origin
[04:06:43] videos can't be talking about that yes so it did sound crazy the way you were talking about but
[04:06:49] then I remember like we didn't just buy sugar cubes but every once in a while like you'd get
[04:06:54] the little pack right with all the sugar cubes and it and I eat those two they're like little candies
[04:07:00] yeah but it's like pure it's like main lining the sugar it's been a good I didn't hide
[04:07:04] them on my bed I was gonna say imagine it stealing those things from your own family
[04:07:11] putting a video it's like little cycle right that's different yeah well monk fruit no sugar
[04:07:16] exact that's not sure monk fruit is good stuff it's natural and by the way we went that distance
[04:07:21] and I held out wrong the other thing that's cool about this drink is which was really hard to do
[04:07:26] is the way that you make it stay good on the shelf is it has to you have to preserve it somehow
[04:07:33] and what no companies normally do is they just add chemicals to it right and they're called
[04:07:37] preservatives we've all heard of that right well instead of using preservatives which I didn't want
[04:07:41] to do it's it's pasteurized so it's like cooked so there's no but there's no chemicals in it but
[04:07:48] it costs us up ton of money to get it going and it took us an extra almost took us over six months
[04:07:55] to get this all set up but then we did it now you can drink this and your kids can drink it that's
[04:07:59] my own kids can drink my drink it's it's something that my my mom always encouraged us and it's
[04:08:06] like a habit I got into from a young age just like just read the ingredients before you buy it
[04:08:11] and if you don't understand half of the things that are on the ingredients then
[04:08:15] you know think twice about you know putting it in your body let me ask you if you understand these
[04:08:21] ingredients filtered carbonated water natural flavor citric acid monk fruit that's the ingredient list
[04:08:32] and it has the vitamin B6 and B12 it's got the other positive things but actual the food ingredients
[04:08:38] that's it that's incredible and more people are becoming conscious of this these things really I mean
[04:08:44] more people are becoming aware and whether it's because of health like diabetes and or whatever else
[04:08:49] but I think there's just an increased level of awareness of like hey and and even more so with COVID
[04:08:54] like I really should be healthy I should strengthen my immune system and I should know what I'm
[04:09:01] consuming I felt so bad the last time you visited so whatever three months ago something like that
[04:09:09] you came by we didn't have time to record I didn't have time to record or whatever but you just
[04:09:13] came by to hang out a little bit and whatever two days later I called you up and said hey
[04:09:19] hey or I sent you a text hey how you doing you're like fine I'm like got so detailed you
[04:09:24] you're like why I got COVID it's over that control yeah I had to make luckily I only saw
[04:09:34] the 10 people in that time period of whatever that week was where I knew I had well I had been
[04:09:40] tested positive for COVID taxidako he's like yeah I can't smell anything but it happens
[04:09:53] I'm just gonna knock on wood right now that yeah but yeah so there you go
[04:10:03] yeah you talk about the immunity thing yeah so come to the final jockel has that covered as well
[04:10:08] as far as supplementation goes vitamin D3 also the immunity and a special supplement called cold
[04:10:15] war it was good again this was crazy right like so I before COVID I traveled all the time
[04:10:21] all the time and you know the nightmare of that and you're breathing and everyone's stuff
[04:10:25] and so I said you know what I'm gonna make you know a good immunity booster with a bunch of
[04:10:31] vitamin C and just things that and so I made it and cool and we ended with selling good and whatever
[04:10:36] but then COVID hit and the tooth and I also made vitamin D already made it this isn't like oh
[04:10:42] it's COVID it was already in the system it was already it was already live because I only I take vitamin
[04:10:47] D and boom as soon as COVID hit it was like we could we had to just we sold out almost immediately
[04:10:53] and then we just had to ramp it up but luckily we had already had the formula's built so
[04:10:57] that stuff is awesome cold war and then and the vitamin D3
[04:11:00] it's true oh good for you yeah I mean I'm a I'm a supplement taker just in general but I was
[04:11:08] not taking vitamin D prior to COVID nor was I really aware of how important it was until I started
[04:11:15] to learn and read more and see especially related to COVID how most Americans are deficient
[04:11:22] yeah like vast majority of Americans are deficient in vitamin D and especially people who have
[04:11:27] any kind of you know colored tone to their skin even more so are found to be deficient in vitamin D
[04:11:36] so I am now a daily consumer well vitamin D yeah again I learned that when we had our daughter
[04:11:44] where everything in a reed for best development all this stuff vitamin D was always popping up
[04:11:49] with everything oh yeah vitamin D true but yeah so yeah got some get some vitamin D
[04:11:55] also don't forget about milk this is extra protein in the form of a dessert yeah by the way
[04:12:01] sometimes it's just dessert that has protein straight up straight up yeah especially if you get
[04:12:05] you little formula down like some people they just go milk milk milk milk on the milk whatever cool
[04:12:10] good but some of us we we have our perfectly tuned formula yeah half a spoon of peanut butter
[04:12:18] one scoop mint chocolate one scoop peanut butter chocolate one banana damn wow
[04:12:25] give milk or two percent milk boom that's the formula in my household I randomly tried almond milk
[04:12:32] with peanut butter milk bro yeah the gym what is up that's a freaking milkshake yeah
[04:12:41] that's a milkshake so that I added a banana like reluctantly like I was like okay banana
[04:12:46] because sometimes banana can jam up your whole flavor profile let me ask you this are they frozen
[04:12:52] or fresh both whatever because okay and then because the result is a little bit different
[04:12:57] it's possible I'm not that advanced to tell the difference and here dude here's why I know
[04:13:01] about the frozen banana want a banana starting to get uh right in a little bit past right
[04:13:06] the kind of brown is taking over you can peel it and freeze it as what I do yes I didn't know that
[04:13:11] Sarah told me that yeah it was like cool sure enough she has two of them frozen inside because they
[04:13:16] need a banana so I put the frozen one in I was like man this works perfect yeah they get creamier
[04:13:22] when they're frozen no check that's my job I might as similar to you we had to wait
[04:13:28] over four hours for you to find me drop this knowledge the secret that's gonna be a foodie
[04:13:36] what is that okay good these we grew up my mom used to make ice cream at home from frozen
[04:13:41] bananas and just like literally put them through the champion juicer freeze them put them through
[04:13:45] the champion juicer maybe add a little bit of like whatever some to kind of like put it up to the
[04:13:51] next level but like you have like homemade soft serve immediately so the frozen bananas I vouch for
[04:13:59] I I'm waiting for the plant based milk yeah to come out I don't know if I talk to you or
[04:14:03] paint about that but you may have to hear it but that's what I do is for after my workouts every
[04:14:11] day my first meal that's my first meal as a shake I'd kind of fast until after that but I do the
[04:14:17] the protein powder the almond milk the peanut butter just a healthy healthy so I doll up
[04:14:23] these things and then someone's going to stir up all the food got the frozen banana and then I throw in I throw in some
[04:14:31] chia seeds some pumpkin seeds and flat seeds but you guys maybe feel like a amateur so before I don't
[04:14:39] know that's not really a bad thing I go I go milk I don't make it that's it's true it's a
[04:14:47] hardy shake but then I'm good like I'm good until like you know I look an early dinner. Yeah yeah that's kind
[04:14:54] of the good thing you can use it for many different reasons you know you can do like a meal replacement
[04:15:00] or just a supplementation for the protein or just a dessert or you can just relax it by
[04:15:05] if you said protein that's how I'm the push I didn't smell no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[04:15:11] okay for those I would put that as the lotion you said you said protein in flex double flexed your
[04:15:16] body says it happened I'm also witnessed it I witnessed it it's it's serious we're in the
[04:15:23] way so we can get these things at many places you're gonna be on the look up for any of these
[04:15:30] places you can get all this stuff at first wah wah east coast wah was only on the east coast
[04:15:35] right yes okay wah wah um at origin main dot com jockel fuel dot com jockel fuel dot com kind of the same
[04:15:44] what do you call trajectory yeah go vitamin chockel and the vitamin choc yes sir by the way this is
[04:15:50] important actually because shipping is a problem right financially it can cost a lot of money to
[04:15:58] ship something here's the deal if you subscribe to any of these items shipping free wow so we're trying
[04:16:05] to look there's we're talking about tech companies there's obviously some big tech companies out there
[04:16:10] that are hard to compete with in fact we you can't be them join them we join them it's fine
[04:16:14] you can get the stuff there because it's free shipping you know it's like a it's like sort of a
[04:16:19] that's a prime merry reason why people might order from this particular place which is cool we're
[04:16:24] down we appreciate it hundred percent that's fine but if you wanted to just go straight to the source
[04:16:31] but you didn't want to spend money on shipping we got you covered and it took us a while to figure
[04:16:35] out how we could balance it if you subscribe shipping's free on whatever you order so that's kind of
[04:16:41] huge when you're talking about it's a very rich and protein right now yeah and echo no offense
[04:16:52] to echo sometimes he's not quite the pinnacle of organization morning comes
[04:17:00] I'm doing the best it comes it's a matter of it look again look I I preface it by saying no offense
[04:17:06] so therefore you can't be offended yeah yeah I'm doing the best I can't over here I'm out of
[04:17:11] mold by the way there you go why are you subscribed well got issues yeah that is huge nonetheless
[04:17:18] over there flexing your biases right now all the way look this is where how and where we can get
[04:17:23] all these things also way to stay on the path do you do you do to more martial arts martial arts good
[04:17:31] for you it's good for your mind body I'm glad you're being diplomatic now well he's being diplomatic
[04:17:36] and like including all increase my almost life he's never said anything like that before ever
[04:17:42] we talk about doing martial arts we're talking about you do to over here on our side
[04:17:47] that's what we're talking about you are correct but go ahead continue this is a diplomatic
[04:17:51] he's the truth he's diplomacy already today just hang out with you he's got a low-ha
[04:17:56] it's just he's this guy has no a low-hafer other martial arts yeah it's like that you're here
[04:18:02] okay everything's cool well either way whatever martial arts we're doing
[04:18:08] say do that stuff in the event of you doing jujitsu you're gonna need a key and or a
[04:18:13] rash guard get those as well from origin how much did you have you trained a little bit not a lot
[04:18:18] I mean I the most the most if you could I guess within the family would be army combatives
[04:18:25] okay just legit yeah the army combatives is is a great program yeah I'll apply to you do
[04:18:30] guys exactly I I early on I guess the the the the the martial art that I trained the most and was
[04:18:38] was Brazilian cupueta oh that's right I was it makes me laugh every time I hear you pronounce
[04:18:43] English words with a Brazilian Portuguese accent oh okay I was like yeah I know that's about
[04:18:48] go I talk I said earlier starting office program that I'm very I look I just say what I say
[04:18:53] when it comes to you know Brazilian Portuguese words like if you're gonna talk to me about oh you
[04:18:57] train cup wait I've come to that you like a bro that's a little bit of a run now well
[04:19:06] and because of that I took summer classes in Brazilian Portuguese and Hawaii like uh like
[04:19:11] trying to learn the language I was I was getting fully immersed in the culture and and started to
[04:19:15] do a lot of a lot of the my friends who did cupueta also did jujitsu and metal a lot there's a
[04:19:21] huge Brazilian community in Hawaii because of surfing and obviously most of them do either cupueta
[04:19:26] and jujitsu as well and but I just I was kind of um consumed I was training like six hours a day in
[04:19:33] cupueta and that was I was starting to teach and I was doing a bunch of stuff there but yeah so
[04:19:39] so the most time I spent doing any kind of grappling was was army combat of so which was fun
[04:19:44] well it's cool because now you're gonna be on the journey of jujitsu we're gonna get you a key yeah
[04:19:49] I want I really I I want to learn and I'm a big mix martial arts fan I have been for a long time
[04:19:56] and yeah you went up and trained with duku fist right yeah that was an incredible surprise that I
[04:20:01] was not expecting but he was there to train um Jiang Wiley and she was passing through doing
[04:20:08] a publicity thing so I got to meet her and spar with like use that word and very generously
[04:20:15] she's like come at me like kick me punch like do something like I don't know
[04:20:21] but it like like getting to hit some pads of duku was freaking incredible yeah no yeah it was awesome
[04:20:27] I've cornered a bunch of fighters at UFC and and whenever duku fist was there he's just like
[04:20:34] such an awesome guy super cool super nice super I mean obviously he's a great trainer and everything
[04:20:41] but I just remember to think and this guy's just freaking rad yeah totally totally anyway you know
[04:20:46] like he made us feel just great and um but what I was gonna say is the thing that I've always appreciated
[04:20:52] mocks most about mixed martial arts is you know yeah there are guys who are stronger and boxing
[04:20:57] or striking or whatever but this the strategic that goes into fighters who have a very strong
[04:21:03] ground game when you really watch it is I've just incredible and that's what I've loved most about
[04:21:11] the sport is the strategic thinking that goes into like I'm gonna do this and set you up for
[04:21:16] where I'm gonna put you in you know six moves later or whatever so yeah I'm now that I'm a little
[04:21:24] bit more free um I really do I've been telling my husband this I want to I want to learn we have
[04:21:29] connections in Hawaii and Islands uh speaking of geese jiu jiu jiu jiu geese and jeans and boots
[04:21:37] you went to the factory and name right I did have a job in the origin factory and main and
[04:21:42] to say I was stoked as an understatement and we made a little social media video about it and you know
[04:21:48] got some footage of peach on us around and talking about what they do brought the local media with us
[04:21:53] and local media did a story on on on origin but my husband will tell you in the car ride leaving
[04:22:00] I was so freaking stoked it was it was completely unexpected because I've I've had the privilege of
[04:22:06] going and visiting a number of you know local businesses and shops but the thing that really
[04:22:13] like struck home for me like in a in a visceral way was yeah awesome products but
[04:22:21] the spirit uh the spirit of origin came through loud and clear not just because peats good
[04:22:32] at talking about it but because of what I experienced in the people who work there and um the sense
[04:22:41] of pride and the sense of ownership of the thing that says right there we get to do this and
[04:22:52] and how deeply you all have built the foundation of this American business in the fabric of
[04:22:59] America and that like I was like I left there and I'm like I told peos like um like where do I sign up
[04:23:06] like how do I how do I join this because this is freaking amazing and I talked about it and just
[04:23:12] share that that's why I wanted to share um that video and just the experience of being able to go and
[04:23:17] visit and it was not on the way like farming tin main is on the way to nowhere else I was going
[04:23:25] and it was literally like I called an audible on my team and I'm like yeah we're in main and I'm
[04:23:32] going to take a two-hour like detour to go and visit because the story of uh that you guys are
[04:23:40] sharing of origin main is the story that needs to inspire America especially now in what what we
[04:23:49] can do what we can do here at home and that yes this is about supporting a local business is about
[04:23:56] supporting America and American jobs but it goes so much deeper than that that yeah of course
[04:24:02] there are challenges and there as adversity and you know foreign trade and like all of these other
[04:24:07] things but just like um you know peat talks about how he started right and and his freaking
[04:24:15] backyard built a factory because there wasn't one where there's a will there's a way and when you're
[04:24:22] rooted in this foundation of not just hey how can we make a bunch of money but how do how do you
[04:24:31] use business as a means to serve and have a positive impact in your community in the lives of the
[04:24:40] people who work there in the customers who know like hey I'm not just buying a product that's cool
[04:24:46] I'm supporting a mission that's much greater than any one of us as individuals and will have a
[04:24:52] much longer lasting impact yeah if you were to take what you just said if you were to if you
[04:24:59] and I were to look at each other and say hey let's make a business and let's make you know let's
[04:25:02] make clothes let's make a parallel let's make shoes and let's make money the last thing we would
[04:25:08] do to make money is try and build a factory in America correct and source everything from America
[04:25:13] we just said we just say it is absolutely sad and there's company upon company that their primary
[04:25:19] goals to make money that's their primary goal it's not to make a quality product it's not to be
[04:25:25] innovative with their products it's not to rebuild their community it's not to put money back into
[04:25:30] the community it's not to not to bring manufacturing back to America that's that's not even on their
[04:25:35] radar those are our primary goals now in order to do that we do we have to make money yes absolutely
[04:25:41] and we will but that's not why we're doing it if we just wanted to make money we wouldn't be
[04:25:48] there would be no factory it'd be it'd be a sweatshop overseas that's what it would be
[04:25:53] we're not gonna do that we're never gonna do that and you'd be no different than most of the others
[04:25:57] you know and and it would it you wouldn't be you origin wouldn't be origin then absolutely
[04:26:07] and to be quite frank with you money could not drive me or inspire me or motivate me
[04:26:15] one 100th the amount that it does to know that there's people in that town yes that are working
[04:26:26] that are have a career now you know we're taking millennials and teaching them a skill that was
[04:26:34] just always so close to being lost you saw them right there millennials that there's skills that
[04:26:39] were I mean are our our guide Lenny just died but he before he died he was able to pass on his knowledge
[04:26:47] that can be passed on could save it's there we're we're there and it's also also stoked you know
[04:26:54] you and our text and back and forth and I think I was trying to get you a pair of boots I was like
[04:26:58] hey we'll get you some boots and yeah we had some in deliver you boots but for you to go up there
[04:27:03] was I was so stoked that you could go up there and you could see it and and you know it's it's very
[04:27:08] cool to like I'll hear Joe Rogan talking about origin and even though he's not been there
[04:27:15] like he knows that's very cool and when I when I heard him talking about origin and he was just
[04:27:21] talking about it with someone else that was was on his show when I heard him talking about it
[04:27:27] so passionately I realized this is people get it you don't just you look it's awesome when you
[04:27:33] go they're not as soon you go there it's visceral when you go there but even if you don't go there
[04:27:39] you know you know that some that pair of jeans that you're wearing those are those are American
[04:27:45] made the hands that harvested the cotton processed it every step that's the amazing thing is and I you
[04:27:53] know some of my some of my friends and the military especially when they got their stimulus checks
[04:27:59] they're like I'm gonna make a choice with this money and I'm gonna go shopping at origin because
[04:28:06] cool stuff but I'm supporting America with these dollars and that that's the difference and that's
[04:28:14] the impact and and I I I loved sharing the story of my experience there to help inspire others
[04:28:22] who may aspire to do something similar but feel like the obstacles are too great but but
[04:28:28] and whether it's business or whatever I mean that the point is the motivation and the spirit of
[04:28:33] getting back to not planning this but getting back to our origins who we are as a country of
[04:28:40] entrepreneurs and innovators and people who are bringing different ideas to to and the pride
[04:28:48] the pride that goes that goes along with that origin USA yeah origin USA
[04:28:58] dot com if you want to get me stuff from there it's made by Americans for Americans true also
[04:29:05] me point your attention to jocco store dot com this is where you can represent why you're on the path
[04:29:11] there you go so yeah we have some some stuff that we have is from origin we got rash guards on there
[04:29:18] also we have hoodies and shirts and you know discipline equals freedom this kind of stuff I'm saying
[04:29:22] if you're going to go seems to get uncomfortable and you start talking about him
[04:29:25] is it that obvious is that obvious there's a visible shift here yeah in energy what's funny
[04:29:32] is it's kind of like a complimentary relationship because like my comfort increases when his
[04:29:37] disc comfort increases you same so it's like cool that's like you can kind of sense
[04:29:42] some pride when I talk about this store got a store by the way anyway yes this link was for
[04:29:48] him but shirts hoodies rash guards some hats on there some new stuff on there new design coming
[04:29:55] up soon really all that you know these are all things that happen decentralized command yep
[04:30:00] like I'm not over there pointing the finger making things happen that's echo Charles in his own
[04:30:05] little world well it's it's our world we have a subscription situation as well if you want
[04:30:12] like a new type of design kind of um is that what the is that where the run DMC t-shirt just came from yes
[04:30:19] that's legit I was good because I've proved these before they're done or sometimes sometimes
[04:30:25] there is a level of decentralized command but I also some people in the organization will say a case
[04:30:32] they need to get footage check so there is sometimes but occasionally things that by like he just
[04:30:40] made a run DMD run DMC t-shirt but it says discipline but it's D.F was a D.S.C PLN but it looks like the old school
[04:30:49] run DMC t-shirt so it's freaking legit that's it thought so too there's also one's like the element
[04:30:56] in the periodic table yeah element yeah so it's element D and it has all the the atomic weight
[04:31:01] 1434 layers anyway these are kind of off shoot designs but they're cool relevant and there's
[04:31:08] layers oh here's the thing that's jacked up now I just realized if you wanted that run DMC discipline
[04:31:13] shirt you can only get it if you subscribe if you're a subscriber to the shirt locker the shirt locker
[04:31:20] of that hotel yeah once they're gone they're gone so man let me do it that's kind of a bummer
[04:31:27] yeah and by the way it seems like one person at this table does not have a subscription to this
[04:31:33] what's funny is I for real have a subscription to I for real don't oh you don't
[04:31:38] just jacked up brutal brutal I thought you were calling me out by not calling me out
[04:31:42] oh okay there's two people that don't have a subscription apparently thing that makes two of us
[04:31:48] they guess whatever either way maybe I have some extra oh cookie guys oh man that's cool yeah that

[04:35:56] started because it's an emotional situation she started to cry oh my god this is not lost you this was
[04:36:02] after a day after she read it she started crying and and she was like and and then I was kind of like oh
[04:36:08] I go I guess that's a good she she's like it's just that that part so and I'm okay so it's very interesting
[04:36:15] so not that it's just it's just not a sob story but it's just you want to write a book that moves people
[04:36:22] he well I mean yeah I guess I guess if it's not gonna have any impact or if it's gonna have
[04:36:28] an impact that's a good thing to make people think yeah and it's uh it's it's definitely even as I
[04:36:34] read it and I've read it now a hundred times because I have to edit it you know there's some parts
[04:36:38] where I'm reading it and it's definitely it's it's it's heavy it's heavy and it's got some really funny
[04:36:44] parts too a lot of the dialogue is really funny because you know it's reflective of kind of the
[04:36:50] dialogue that I have with people even though it's not about me or is it I'm watching it's been to
[04:36:56] interpretation yeah it's sort of an alternative
[04:37:02] anyways the book is called Final Spin and you can pre-order right now if you want to get a first
[04:37:07] a dish if you want to get a first a dish order now I look this is gonna be kind of a big deal to
[04:37:14] get the first a dish of the first novel you know I'm the one so I'm over-hyping that is the second
[04:37:20] in the works this this book will have no follow on okay for various reasons it
[04:37:28] pointy it does conclude it is called Final Spin it's not like first spin so it is called
[04:37:38] Final Spin but also I it's it is it is complete sure in my mind it's complete and so I don't want
[04:37:48] to carry the story on but you have more novels in you oh yeah maybe I got 14 novels that I thought
[04:37:54] of during the last half an hour yeah awesome yeah it's unfortunate for me it's always just
[04:38:02] people say I don't know what to write about I'm like god I wish I had that problem so that's that final
[04:38:08] spin pre-order leadership strategy in tactics field manual the code the valuation of protocol
[04:38:13] discipline it was freedom field manual way the warrior kid for field manual that's out way the warrior
[04:38:20] kid one two and three Mikey in the dragons I'll sit in into I was just an adjordan Peterson
[04:38:29] yesterday and he was just going off about the dragons which is a lot of what he does and interestingly
[04:38:38] enough I was like hmm sounds like this book called Mikey in the dragons so check that one out about
[04:38:45] face by David Hacworth there's a forward by me and Tossi you've I just got it in the mail a couple
[04:38:54] of days before I left Hawaii and I have read your forward okay and I'm just starting what's the
[04:39:00] impression starting the book um how incredibly impactful this book and this man has been on your
[04:39:10] life as a person but the thing that really like spoke to me was how this was kind of a your go to
[04:39:21] reference to help guide you through difficult leadership choices decisions challenges that you face
[04:39:27] in some of the most difficult environments I eat being in at war and and that you've never met the man
[04:39:33] and that was that came through very clear and you're gratitude to him in having this this book
[04:39:44] that provided you with that place where you could find the answers that you couldn't find anywhere else
[04:39:50] or help you see things in a different way that you wouldn't have seen otherwise through his experiences
[04:39:55] and how he handled things or his perspective and then the the maybe the most important thing was
[04:40:02] that all of that came from the foremost concern being care for your guys his soldiers your
[04:40:12] seals soldiers who you were were people who you were responsible for and I thought that was a
[04:40:22] really cool thing for me to come at I've only heard you talk about it but to come at this book
[04:40:27] and I'm really looking forward to to read it but to see that bridge in time and that that
[04:40:34] and conflicts and wars between a guy who served in in Vietnam and was a leader of soldiers in
[04:40:40] Vietnam to you in the experience that you had at the leader serving in Iraq and how there was such
[04:40:48] powerful connection between two different leaders and two different wars in different places
[04:40:53] and different times that that's not something I've really heard of before.
[04:41:02] It's weird because I as I read that book have you ever seen the movie that I think it's called the
[04:41:07] 13th Warrior have you heard of this movie Tom Cruise no so anyways it's based on it's based on a book
[04:41:16] by Michael Criton and I can't remember the name of the book that it's based upon but it's about this
[04:41:23] Arabic person who gets somehow mixed up with the Vikings and there's a great scene and the
[04:41:34] Arabic guy is played by some famous actor I can't think of it. I could tell you really where she
[04:41:41] is coming up. But they show they they they do this scene where he's learning to speak
[04:41:48] Norwegian or whatever old Norse whatever language they're speaking and the way that they cut it up they're
[04:41:53] speaking Norwegian and then every once in a while an English word pops in which would have been an
[04:42:00] Arabic movie Arabic word but it's an English speaking movie so every once in a while an English word
[04:42:08] will pop in says about it. It's a rather rather rather rather a rather rather a rather
[04:42:11] bolder tree and so and he starts picking up and it's probably a two minute scene whereby the end
[04:42:18] all the words are in English. The reason I'm telling you this is because as you were talking about
[04:42:24] the book about face I feel like each time I read it like a little because it's not a book about
[04:42:30] leadership and you know you mentioned leadership it's not a book about leadership it's a book about
[04:42:33] a guy's life but it's like as each time I read it a little leadership thing would come through
[04:42:40] and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and eventually the whole thing I realized
[04:42:44] this whole thing is just about leadership and it's about how to take care of your troops and do
[04:42:47] the mission and it's it's I just had that thought as you were as you were describing the
[04:42:55] correlations between what he lived through and what I lived there which by the way just for the
[04:43:00] record not even close. He was in Korean Vietnam he's the he had three distinguished service
[04:43:06] crosses nine silver stuff I mean just totally different but good book check out.
[04:43:14] The closest thing that I can relate to in my time in the military is you mentioned band of
[04:43:20] brothers earlier and I was a brand new maybe I was an E3 or an E4 by that point but I picked up the
[04:43:27] book band of brothers before ever watching the the many series I don't even know if it was made at
[04:43:33] that time yet but I was brand new in the national guard I started reading the book just as we were
[04:43:39] about to go and do an annual training at Fort Indian Town Gap in Pennsylvania and I'm reading the
[04:43:44] book I'd like can't put it down we go there were there for ten days or two weeks or whatever it was
[04:43:49] on the plane going back to Hawaii and I finished the book and at the end of the book it says
[04:43:56] Dick Winners currently resides in Fort Indian Town Gap Pennsylvania where he lives with his wife
[04:44:02] yeah yeah and I'm just like why didn't I finish this two days earlier I would have definitely gone
[04:44:08] and knocked on this man and he was still alive at the time that was but but I've you know gone on
[04:44:15] and watched I mean I've watched this year I don't even know how many times I've watched it
[04:44:20] in OCS we had to write essays on different episodes from a leadership perspective leadership lessons
[04:44:27] good and bad and really analyzed each episode of that and so that's one I'm at that's the only kind
[04:44:34] of closest thing I can relate to we're going back and looking at him and his leadership and I always
[04:44:40] forget the guy's name but the guy who's Ross in France so thank you his his flawed leadership I would say
[04:44:49] and a lessons learned from that and as a specialist then and then a brand new lieutenant I I have
[04:44:56] often gone back to those leadership lessons including the ones of you know some of the
[04:45:03] gosh I'm forgetting the name now some of the enlisted characters and one that was played by Donnie
[04:45:09] Walberg um one of the main e-sixes and and that was I had a chance to meet Donnie Walberg
[04:45:15] out of veterans event and like I don't I don't really care about celebrities in general but I saw
[04:45:21] he was there I'm like I need to go speak to this person about band of brothers and it was it was
[04:45:27] really cool he's a huge huge huge supporter of veterans I was on a show called the billions
[04:45:33] you were yeah and the the one of the main characters and billions of guy name Axel Rod
[04:45:39] uh yeah is he also played dick winners he is forever dick winners in my mind I don't care
[04:45:44] he was in homeland too like yeah whatever your dick winners but we you know he we were sitting
[04:45:49] around and talking and and he said something along the lines of like oh you know I was in something
[04:45:54] called band of brothers like yeah I kind of I know I'm well aware of it and so we talked a
[04:46:00] bunch about it it was it was interesting because in those I'd never done any like Hollywood
[04:46:08] things before actually I was like said yeah yeah he likes to throw that out of me well when you do it
[04:46:15] you film the same thing 10 times if not more so like there's a scene where we're waking the guy up
[04:46:24] in bed and there's me and Ax and Wags have you watched billions before I've only seen one or two
[04:46:34] okay really it's a free-confidentastic show okay so me ax and why it's three characters and so we're
[04:46:39] waking the Guy up the first time we film it is like they're filming all three of us and we
[04:46:47] deliver the lines and then you stop and then they reset up all the cameras and then they do it
[04:46:52] again but they're just filming me and then they reset up the cameras and they do again they're
[04:46:55] just filming Wags they we filmed again they they're just filming Ax and they and they
[04:46:59] we filmed again they're just filming the girl in bed and they reformed again and then they do
[04:47:02] it from a hideous and then do it so it ends up on you and doing this thing 10 times 15 times
[04:47:08] And by the way, if someone messes up, doing it again.
[04:47:12] So I was talking to him and I said,
[04:47:15] how in God's name did you film like a battle scene?
[04:47:18] Yeah.
[04:47:19] How the hell did you do that?
[04:47:20] He's totally different because there's basically
[04:47:23] guys running around with cameras and they do it
[04:47:26] one freaking time and they just have to get it right.
[04:47:30] And they're running through it because explosions
[04:47:32] are going off and like a building is gonna get destroyed.
[04:47:34] And it's only gonna get one take.
[04:47:35] Yeah.
[04:47:36] So that was pretty interesting.
[04:47:38] No pressure, right?
[04:47:39] He's an actor.
[04:47:40] Not only because of that, just the logistics of it,
[04:47:44] but like the history and what you're doing
[04:47:47] and who you're representing like my gosh,
[04:47:50] I can imagine.
[04:47:52] He, um, so if someone messes up,
[04:47:57] the director comes in like talks to him, right?
[04:48:00] He's a rapper man.
[04:48:01] Like I'm serious.
[04:48:02] So if someone, maybe he doesn't mess up,
[04:48:04] but maybe he's not putting the right right,
[04:48:06] stank on it, right?
[04:48:08] You know what I was like,
[04:48:08] your technical intentions too little.
[04:48:10] You know, you're being too emotional.
[04:48:13] And so it happened.
[04:48:14] I didn't really, I didn't know any of this.
[04:48:16] I do playing a military person.
[04:48:19] I played yourself.
[04:48:20] I, I, I had a real stretch of a role.
[04:48:23] I played me.
[04:48:25] Okay.
[04:48:25] All right.
[04:48:26] Yeah, so I played me and I was,
[04:48:27] whenever trying to, I was trying to help a guy
[04:48:29] win a, a smoker's fight of boxing match.
[04:48:32] And we're training him.
[04:48:33] Um, but if you mess up,
[04:48:37] or you don't put enough for you put a little too much or whatever,
[04:48:41] the director, actually the first the assistant director's going to come and give you a little nudge in the right direction of haters.
[04:48:46] You know, you don't be so loud.
[04:48:49] You know, you're too emotional.
[04:48:50] This isn't supposed to be funny or whatever.
[04:48:52] Something like that.
[04:48:52] And so this actually happened to me.
[04:48:54] I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about stuff like this.
[04:48:56] Maybe it's off limits.
[04:48:58] But it's done.
[04:48:59] It's fine.
[04:49:00] It happened to one of the other actors.
[04:49:02] We were doing it is just mean one of their actors in a scene.
[04:49:05] And we do it.
[04:49:07] And I'm just doing what I do.
[04:49:08] So honestly, it's pretty, if I have to get talk to it,
[04:49:11] it's a problem because I'm just a nice guy.
[04:49:12] So I'm doing what I'm doing.
[04:49:15] And the assistant director comes down first and is like,
[04:49:19] you know, I want to back that down a little bit.
[04:49:21] Don't talk to me, but talk to the other guy.
[04:49:22] And, and he's like, well, we're going to do it again.
[04:49:24] He's like, yeah, we're going to do it again,
[04:49:25] which is kind of a big deal like,
[04:49:27] it's not a small thing, right?
[04:49:29] We're actually, because I remember saying,
[04:49:31] wait, we're going to have to shoot this.
[04:49:31] I'm going to go, yeah, we're going to shoot it again.
[04:49:33] So it's kind of, ooh.
[04:49:36] So I realized that this was kind of a thing.
[04:49:39] If you, and then if you continue to mess up,
[04:49:41] then it's not just the assistant director,
[04:49:43] it's the director is going to come down and try and give you,
[04:49:46] you know, whatever, whatever they give you.
[04:49:48] They give you a motivation.
[04:49:50] But this is the problem.
[04:49:52] And so I'm watching this going, I don't want none of this.
[04:49:55] And so I remember what I,
[04:49:58] so now it's me, accent wax,
[04:50:01] and they're the main guys and these guys,
[04:50:03] and I didn't know anything about anything, right?
[04:50:05] But this is a very popular show,
[04:50:07] and it's a incredibly well written show.
[04:50:10] The writers, I know the writers now,
[04:50:12] and they're just so good.
[04:50:14] And you understand, so anyway,
[04:50:16] there, we do a take, right?
[04:50:21] Hollywood.
[04:50:22] We do a take, and like, you can hear,
[04:50:25] you can hear like radios, like you can hear some,
[04:50:27] and you, so now you realize someone messed up, right?
[04:50:31] And then they come walking up,
[04:50:33] and he comes walking up,
[04:50:36] you can use behind us to directly pull
[04:50:38] some of the other guys, and I was like,
[04:50:40] and I said to, accent, I was like,
[04:50:43] real I thought he was coming for me.
[04:50:45] And he goes, we all think that,
[04:50:47] we're like,
[04:50:48] oh, you're not alone, even the pros don't like,
[04:50:52] oh, get the talking to.
[04:50:55] Yeah, yeah, yeah, so there you go.
[04:50:57] Other books, extreme ownership, first book,

[04:51:52] at Gettysburg.
[04:51:54] Yeah, and we sit there,
[04:51:56] we talk through the decisions that were made.
[04:51:58] We talk about gender we,
[04:51:59] and long-streeting AP Hill and Stuart and Mead
[04:52:03] and Hancock and Reynolds and Joshua Chamberlain from Maine.
[04:52:08] We talk through their personalities,
[04:52:11] decisions that got made, egos that got involved,

[04:52:37] It's, we will answer whatever questions you have
[04:52:40] and we will all learn about these lessons.
[04:52:43] So if you want to go to that,
[04:52:45] go to go to go to www.slauncha.com slash events
[04:52:48] to check that out.
[04:52:49] Did you take a note there on the phone?
[04:52:50] I did.
[04:52:52] Highly recommend.
[04:52:53] I've had the opportunity to do that a few times.
[04:52:56] One of which while I was,
[04:52:59] well, we went to the battlefield of Chickamaga
[04:53:03] when I was in OCS and we did that as a class.
[04:53:07] So good.
[04:53:08] Incredible bringing history to life
[04:53:11] and making it relevant, especially
[04:53:13] from a leadership perspective that applies
[04:53:15] whether you're in the military or not.
[04:53:17] But something I found out pretty cool
[04:53:20] in the last year or so,
[04:53:22] I was asked to be on the show on PBS,
[04:53:25] called Finding Your Roots.
[04:53:27] And it's a show that features different people
[04:53:30] in my episode.
[04:53:31] They also had Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio,
[04:53:34] but like Oprah, they had different people on
[04:53:37] and they dig into your genealogy
[04:53:40] and find stories about your roots,
[04:53:43] where you come from, who you come from.
[04:53:44] And I found out that
[04:53:47] one of my ancestors on my mother's side of the family
[04:53:53] was 39, 40 years old
[04:53:56] when he volunteered to serve in the Union army
[04:54:03] and that he, and they had the documentation there
[04:54:08] of one of those battlefields
[04:54:12] where he fought that I had been to previously
[04:54:16] and visited and walked through.
[04:54:19] And it was the most like,
[04:54:21] it was the most incredible thing on many levels
[04:54:24] to see like this guy gave up his life to go
[04:54:28] and fight for what he believed in
[04:54:32] and that I had generations later,
[04:54:35] not only physically walked through that battlefield
[04:54:37] where he was, but also chose a similar path
[04:54:43] with my life.
[04:54:44] And so it was just, it was, it was
[04:54:47] and I've gone back to Gettysburg a few times since
[04:54:50] and every single time I go,
[04:54:55] it's an incredibly powerful experience
[04:54:58] incredibly powerful.
[04:54:59] And to go to the place where,
[04:55:01] of course, Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg address.
[04:55:05] Yeah, yeah, it's when,
[04:55:08] because we basically we spend the two days walking
[04:55:11] and then when we wrap it up
[04:55:13] and you kind of now you clearly know
[04:55:16] and you've seen the low ground,
[04:55:19] the high ground, the trees, the buildings
[04:55:22] and you're walking worth thousands of men were killed.
[04:55:26] Yeah.
[04:55:28] It's just unbelievable, it's an unbelievable event.
[04:55:34] It's an unbelievable place
[04:55:35] and it's an incredible way to learn and solidify those.
[04:55:38] So that's EF, echelonfront.com slash events

[04:56:35] And that's how I know I'm kinda getting there.
[04:56:39] And as I got, as when we got here today,
[04:56:42] as I got out of the car, I was responding
[04:56:45] to Twitter or Instagram, and I had just made a comment.
[04:56:50] And I got out of the car as a day,
[04:56:51] you know, I'll sometimes you say that to me.
[04:56:54] Cause someone had said the last woman
[04:56:56] that was on Holly McKay, someone had said,
[04:56:58] oh, did she, does she stay for the support section?
[04:57:01] Meaning what we've dragged you into
[04:57:03] from the fast freaking hour and just about.
[04:57:06] And I said, no, she was able to withstand,
[04:57:12] you know, ISIS interrogations, but she couldn't hang
[04:57:16] with Echos Charles and the support.
[04:57:19] So there you go.
[04:57:20] Yeah, he's very happy with that one.
[04:57:22] Yeah, he's the pride in the tone of the comment.
[04:57:26] There you go.
[04:57:27] Admittedly so guilty.
[04:57:29] If you want more of us, you can find us on the internet
[04:57:32] and that's including TLC's way.
[04:57:35] TLC's well at TLC Gabbard, Echoes At Echo Charles,
[04:57:39] and I am at Jocca Willing.
[04:57:41] Echo Charles, you got anything else?
[04:57:43] Are you running for president again ever,
[04:57:45] or even possibly?
[04:57:47] Do you think?
[04:57:48] I don't know.
[04:57:48] I'm not thinking about it at all.
[04:57:51] If you did, would you ask about aliens?
[04:57:53] Remember how?
[04:57:54] Who's someone asked about aliens, right?
[04:57:56] I think so.
[04:57:57] I think it was like Clinton or something.
[04:57:59] It's not on the top of my list.
[04:58:01] I understand.
[04:58:02] Put it that way.
[04:58:04] There you go.
[04:58:05] Did I say something about Echoes questions?
[04:58:07] Earlier.
[04:58:09] He saved the best for last.
[04:58:11] What's funny is when I first met you or whatever.
[04:58:14] I was like, I don't think I ever
[04:58:15] met anyone that ran for president before.
[04:58:18] So then you know how you kind of think,
[04:58:19] like, what would I ask?
[04:58:21] And then for some reason.
[04:58:22] This is it.
[04:58:22] Yeah, this is the moment.
[04:58:24] All the rest of the stuff is like, OK, whatever.
[04:58:26] But oh, man.
[04:58:29] God, you have nothing else.
[04:58:31] But thank you.
[04:58:32] Awesome.
[04:58:33] Toll see.
[04:58:34] Thank you.
[04:58:35] Any closing thoughts?
[04:58:36] It's great to be here.
[04:58:38] And we've covered a lot.
[04:58:41] And there's a lot more to come.
[04:58:43] Yeah.
[04:58:44] Awesome.
[04:58:45] Well, obviously, thanks for coming on.
[04:58:48] I know we try to make this happen for a little bit.
[04:58:49] And glad you kind of finally get on here.
[04:58:52] And thanks for your service in the United States government.
[04:58:56] Of course.
[04:58:57] But also, obviously, thanks for your service as a soldier, as a leader.
[04:59:01] You're putting your life on the hold and your life at risk to defend the freedoms and the
[04:59:09] way of life that we hold sacred.
[04:59:13] And the same goes to the rest of the military personnel out there around the world.
[04:59:20] On those forgotten barricades on the front lines of freedom, thank you for defending us.
[04:59:26] And to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers
[04:59:30] and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders,
[04:59:35] thank you for defending us as well here at home.
[04:59:40] And to everyone else out there, well, for one thing, ask yourself, is today the day.
[04:59:53] Is today the day.
[04:59:56] And live your life thinking that today could be the day.
[05:00:03] And that means remember, some of that Aloha spirit that Tulsi talks about.
[05:00:12] Treat people with Aloha, treat them with respect and compassion and try and help out other
[05:00:17] people.
[05:00:18] And you do that.
[05:00:19] All those things by first putting your own ego in check, listen more than you talk, praise
[05:00:31] more than you punish, stand up for what you believe in while respecting other people's
[05:00:39] beliefs to and remember, always remember that we are stronger.
[05:00:48] Together.
[05:00:53] And until next time, this is Tulsi and echo and jacco.
