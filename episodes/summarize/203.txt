but he kept caught a fleeting glimpse of done him's helmet on the ground next to the Iraqi done him was on his stomach with his arms outstretched in front of him and wrapped around the sides of his helmet as if you were holding it down on top of something then came the explosion Bill Hampton saw flash of light but the explosion didn't sound very loud to him his vision blurred and he knew that something had happened to him he just didn't know what his first thought was whether his teeth had been hit he ran his tongue along them and was relieved to find them all in place but his face leg and arm leaked red the concussion and broken his nose one tiny metal fragment hit him under the nostrils and another embedded itself in his top lip a piece of shrapnel about the size of a pen tip had it hit him in the right knuckle several shards of metal hit him in the left arm and left leg one piece hit a bone in his forearm broke up and opened an inch wide hole as it exited another travel to up his arm and cut away cut its way out the middle of his elbow leaving exit shaped tear then lodged in his bicep he remembered that slowing his breathing would slow the bleeding and he tried to do so he staggered against the cinder block wall and backed toward the intersection he couldn't left his rifle with his left arms who he held in his right by the trigger guard and pistol grip trying to keep an eye out for enemy fighters a bowman of flash Kelly Miller saw the explosion and it's aftermath in a series of still frames first he saw a done him tipping over his radio headset still on but his helmet gone then Miller saw the sky as he fell over backwards onto the rocket launcher slung from his shoulder he here to steady ring like the sound of a hospital heart monitor makes when the patient flat lines Miller's face hurt and is and felt hot as if he had a bad somber he tasted blood in his mouth and had the vape feeling he was being shot at his left arm hurt next he tried to grab his rifle with his left hand but nothing happened he wondered why his arm wasn't working he looked down to see blood streaming off the fingertips one piece of hot metal admitell admitell's upper lip traveled inside his right cheek and shattered a molar before coming to rest inside of his back cheek other fragments peppered around the area around his eyes left cheek and forehead the blast blew out his left ear drum one piece of grenade shap and went clean through his right tricep side to side and punctured the breakery will artery but for some reason it didn't hurt as bad as his upper left arm which had been hit by five or six big chunks of metal and sprayed with pavol size fragments the explosion left sanders the radio operator temporarily deaf he saw dent done them Miller and Hampton Hampton knocked back by the blast and thought they're all fucking dead you know again for young people and any employment like this whether you're a cop or you're a soldier you're marine whatever situation you're in well this is one thing that we learned there's this idea that when you hit someone if you hit him hard enough they're going to get knocked out and we learned this over and over again that it's not true and there's a chance when you hit someone you can knock him out there's a chance that they don't get knocked out one of my my assistant Petune commander and her room we were taking down a building and there was a a combatif in a combatif in surgeon in there and you know we had learned the muscle strike muscle strike you know muscle strike to the face it'll it'll knock him out for sure it may kill him so you gotta be a little bit careful whatever my assistant Petune commander did the hardest muscle strike I think a person could he he took a running start without eight yards and fully cock back his weapon and then drove it into this guy's head and and it deflected a little bit like around the brow and carved out a big giant chunk of his scalp no factor the guy he's bleeding like a stuck pig but he kept fighting so all that's going on and here we go back to the book while done him Miller and Hampton wrestled with the Iraqi Sergeant Reynolds the sniper told Sanders to provide covered case the Iraqi had friends around so Sanders was more than a dozen dozen yards away from the fight when he heard done him yellow warning well you still hear these explosions I turned to him when I said what do you think and he says I think Leam is getting hit I said well let's go get those motherfuckers so we called his boys and told him they were settling up and pushing out and our vehicles had been satellite into the time on a certain radius outside of our position so we started moving out onto route diamond that was a MSR that would lead us west into Leam and Company's pause and we started running because there was a sense of urgency you know when when the fucking sister units get hit you you want to fucking help so we started running down diamond and Sanders on the run got a hold of the gun trucks and got him to link up with us on time and so before long the truck showed up we mounted up and then started racing west and within moments in RPG flew over one of the highbacks right over Carberhol's head and we knew he had arrived at the ambush site by the time we got in the trucks we heard on the radio net that he wasn't leaving to get mortar because the tank man has patrol just got hit outside the arches which is the almost the eastern periphery of Hussainva and it made you want to please him you know like I remember distinctly like I want this guy to look at me like being pressed like I want him to like me you know but not not I don't like not as a friend I just wanted to look me back that's fucking good and reenact you know that's one of my Marines and so you're trying to live up to this bar he sets and it made us all better I've ever been honored to serve with and so he was getting as much intelligence it could from the cavalry squadron that we were turned over with first to the third ACR was up in all kinds by the time we got there they had been in country for 11th freaking miles and they were operating out of their that base up on the Syrian border if you say about and then their cavalry headquarters was at the train station in all kind which was about you know 28 miles southeast of the the border post you say so we knew that things were going to hell on hand basket up there and across Iraq is a whole that if you were listening to the news reports I'd listen to impure everyone coming in and if you're paying attention that you knew that this this was going to be a wild west and it wasn't going to be the same kind of environment that we had experienced at the end of the pushup you know that in the last three months of OF1 and it really hit me one day I was I was coming in listening to impure news and Normie rifle company commander had been killed that week and they hear that on the radio known that a rifle company commander is killed that you know that this is going to be a different fucking show altogether. exactly yes thank you Phil how old were you at this point Bill 22 22 get some you know he talking to a lot of these guys that have brought on that were going into the most horrible situations whether it was Taroa, Guadalcanat wherever you know there's uh there's something that the young man has which I think we all know which is it's gonna happen to someone else like hey people are gonna get hurt people are gonna get wounded people are gonna get killed not gonna be me and I right there because I was thinking about that when I was reading this book this idea of the Iraqi police became a national program in 2006 before that it had become something called it was something called desert protector which was sort of the same thing like we're gonna get a homegrown kids young men to help police and a lot of that from what I've been told came from alchim when the push happened through alchim but that was in 2005 that the big push happened alchim was an operation manager and those Marines got civilians that came up and said hey there's bad guys over there hey there's bad guys over there and the idea was okay let's get that let's let's hire those people so we're talking now 2004 and and your battalion commander Colonel Lopez was already in the game thinking that way that's impressive force I right there that's outstanding and I got ahead incredible sense of ownership he never waited for permission to do anything he just like oh you know what leadership boils down to is that you care about your men you care about your men because if you care about your men and your men know that then it goes back to what you said Trent if you take care of your men then your men are going to take care of you and the many you see a leader that's walking around barking orders thinking of themselves and by the way anybody that thinks they can they can plot a little good agenda for themselves and their team isn't going to see it you're wrong all day long today and twice on Sunday that's what's going to happen but that leader that's going hey I'm doing this for the good of the team that's the one that will get the crown of leadership there's one story that sticks out to me and it was when we first got in his own where Lima was setting up base there wasn't one so when we weren't doing a patrol we were setting up Hasco barriers and Philanham by hand and you get a working party together go to do it well who does working parties did you in years you know yeah that's a tough spot to get put into you're you got no combat experience you're rolling in here and you're gonna start taking over for guys that do have combat experience that certainly think that they deserve that role that's a tough one one of the things that Tinka brought up about the reorganization like from a brand new boot who doesn't know anything as soon as the reorganization happened one of the side effects was I learned how to shoot machine guns because I was surrounded by a couple of machine guns I learned about mortars I learned about demo you know by the time I deployed I had done him had grilled me so hard about machine guns I could clear and operated 240 I understood like the basics to shooting a 50 cal if I had to in a pinch you know but they have the highest priority for care for another member of our navy marine core team the chaplain an expected patient does not always die expectant means you expect something to happen and most often it is death but sometimes after the higher priority patients have been treated and expecting patients survives their their care should be continued with the resources that can be committed heroic efforts may seem to be helpful in the short run but if resources are expended when the next patient arrives then you have not helped this latter patient this is when judgments are critical and I would dare say that very very few of us have enough experience to make these decisions easily when the decisions must be made talk about it include your entire team and your decisions move on if the patient is expected make sure that he is comfortable and that someone stays with him until something happens the patient does die document the death appropriately at the seven a.m. staff meeting commander sparks a brisk woman whose all burn hair and bright lipsticks stood out next to the black nine millimeter pistol hanging from a shoulder past the chief surgeon's message along to her physicians she briefly discussed it with them highlighting the advice that doctors revisit the expected ones once they have treated the other patients then she moved on to other issues that after noon Jason Dunham arrived at Alpha surgical company expected to die in Alpha surgical companies contingency plan for dealing with mass casualty event responsibility for the expected ward fell in the navy dental team they had enough general knowledge to push intravenous fluids into a dying man but not enough to be much use in the trauma ward operating room or intensive care unit dental technician first class Christopher Graham who had helped carry Jason's stretcher in from the helicopter been waiting outside the emergency room while the doctors completed their triage after 15 minutes the door opened in an and an order emerged from the chaos please take this patient to the expectant ward Graham and three other Graham and three other's carried corporal Dunham's litter to a dim white tile room with a pair of broken shower stalls a tape above the door red washroom all the saw horses were in use elsewhere so the litter team carefully placed the stretcher on the floor Graham sat by corpus by the corporal side across from Rachel Sterling a 21 year old dental technician third class Sterling had chosen service in the navy because her grandfather and great uncle had been in sailors navy lieutenant James L Harris the third a 32 year old dentist from crocket Texas joined them in the expected warm ward and did as the chaplain as did the chaplain lieutenant lents then they waited for corporal Dunham to die for 45 minutes they spoke to him in soft voices holding his hands and stroking his limp muscular arms as lieutenant Harris pushed fluids and painkillers into his veins from an IV sack the Marine Corps is proud of you and we're all proud of you Graham told him well obviously uh Dunham was a fighter and wasn't wasn't wasn't run to give up makes it to Germany and you know again I think um she was up in Germany and this is the situation he was in Jason was hooked up to a plethora of medical equipment over the course of the day there was an intercranial pressure monitor there was a catheter that passed through his eerie footer drain as bladder into a bag a line ran into his left femoral artery demonstrators blood pressure and allow the nurses to draw blood samples easily he had a rectal temperature probe on the right side of his groin was a triple headed catheter running into a vein for IV fluids and drugs there was an endotracheal tube in his mouth to facilitate the passage of air between the ventilator and his lungs plus a suction tube to draw excess fluid from his lungs and an oral gastric tube to suck out stomach acid compressing sleeves on both calves alternately squeezed and relaxed to keep blood moving through his legs to prevent clots five pads on his chest monitor is heart rate a blood oxygen monitor was clip on to his finger a blood pressure cuff was on his arm in case the automatic reading failed the nurses put a sterile plastic cup under each ear to collect the cerebral spinal fluid that continued to drain out of his ear drums and he says what's this and Hampton says you spent your day taking care of us we know you haven't had time to take care of yourself so where it's chum and always remember being a student at TBS you know it's a segmented tenant and hearing stories from instructors about being a good leader has an officer and if you're doing your job and taking care of your brains they're going to take care of you back right like if you're digging into the D you've got more important shit to do than digger on fucking hole there was a story about their about a two commander would come back to find his Marines finishing up his freaking hole for him because he was too busy taking care of them you know to worry about protecting himself and that came back to me in a flash and to me the imagery of them presenting him with that played a child and then you had another gun truck in trail so you get where you're going the fucking squad dismounts and then those four trucks could satellite around the dismounts to keep the enemy guessing while these guys did their work what was the how long are to take for you guys to take casualties rolling in there you remember the times first casualties were on sand panties day fireclaw so you guys got there in February in the same paddies day as what end of March middle of March end of March the actual effective transfer of authority day I think was the damn I think the first week of March maybe it's saying it wouldn't long before we took our first casualties cat red took an idea of the checkpoint 51 in my zone Marines were still rolling around with the windows down we took a hit to the elbow another Marine took strappin all through the window into the back was like the gunner did right and I had to turn that into the COC with all the radio frequencies because he knew I wanted to know like that's how I was I was wanted to know I didn't want to know my team there's job I wanted to know my squad leader's job like I wanted you know but I'm actually going to go and and read a little bit of this book picking up from from that situation so here we go at about 1220 PM the Marines reached the next cross street where the alleyway hit a T junction on the left before the junction was an unfinished single story home made of a tan stone and poured concrete with red metal doors and window grates on the right the alleyway widened out to the courtyard of a concrete and center blockhouse of rusty twisted car chassis lying for the only amid the trash straight ahead over some buildings and about a block away they could see the top of the water treatment plant the dirt lane that crossed in front of them was deeply rotted to their right was bordered on the north side by a tumbled down stone wall and a couple dozen yards further to the west a straight ahead center block wall stopped in the lane where eight vehicles pointing from east pointing east toward the approaching Marines from the corner done him in his men could see a small bus a van a white Toyota land cruiser a second SUV a red tractor a black BMW a white truck frozen in the middle of an attempt to turn around in a narrow lane and finally a white sedan with all four doors open the point man Miller had just reached the T junction when staff sergeant Ferguson a few dozen yards back noticed the lineups line up of vehicles what's going on he asked Corporal Dunham what are you doing done and wanted to keep moving but Ferguson recalled the white SUV that sergeant Reynolds had seen high tailing across J. to few minutes earlier and thought the cars were worth the quick look no Ferguson told Dunham we're going to search these calls cars so there you go guys yeah you know furred was talking earlier about you know making sure that people understand why they're doing what they're doing and how important that is no doubt you know for me that's the key of decentralized command is making sure that everyone knows why they're doing what they're doing but the other thing that happens is when like what you're saying when you give people the opportunity to come up with part of the plan it's like it's elevates them and makes them it's they have ownership of the plan because they made it up you know they made it up and you're you know one of your guys is grappling with an insurgent that can that's a that's a tough shot to take because it's not like a movie where the bad guys hold in the hostage still because this is a fight that's going on and you know anything can happen at any point and the other thing is I mean you guys are you got to think you're I'd be thinking to myself and I mean that's why I frequently went ran point I was like I want to be the first one I want to be in the lead I'm gonna be checked for ideas something happens it's gonna shoot me I know how fast I am I can get by in a wall you know I never ever never crossed my mind I didn't even you know really weird way even with all the casualties that happen I didn't think it was an option but it was always up to 10 Robinson right because it was a team-sized patrol that told time they're up there so in addition to that there was a bit of angst but concern in the air of the company as a whole because we just fired two rifle squad leaders both from the same team Kilo 3 two corpos that had talked a good game came across as no one there shit you know during the training back in 20 poms and we're selected as squad leaders Kilo 3 one and Kilo 3 3 and by the time we were in our third week of operations in all time you could tell in the mission brief prior to step off whether that squad leader knew what the fuck he was doing or not whether he had put a time in effort into preparing his Marines for that fucking patrol and these two Marines two corpos weren't taking it seriously enough they didn't grasp the gravity of the situation they thought they could just bullshit their way through it well he he had multiple like it was a small cash before five guns I think there was an RPG and because it was passing by a period in the windows you know passenger window and I hit the second window vehicle and I saw them and it's like instantaneous as I'm looking up to say something they start fighting and I didn't have a chance of like saying you know I just reacted to go around and assist how many guys were in the vehicle I keep my mouth shut my ears open do what you told so I got I mean I got I got put in charge of a couple of the other boots to make sure they're square to wait when I got there my most memorable memory actually of when we first showed up is I met first certain tempatin at times and at the time Captain Gibbs comes over and addresses us and I just remember it's the weirdest memory he stood with the sun directly as back I know if I can ideally look like at all I couldn't I couldn't see him so I stood post on top one of the buildings while these guys cleared out the rest of the houses in the vicinity and we pulled in some E.P. W's from that right I said whether time date they finished and got back to the site furred was explained to me what had happened and I was looking around and they had taken the weapons out of that land cruiser and stacked them up against the wall and as I recall there were a couple eight days couple RPGs Mark one grenade mills bomb British made grenade looks like a pineapple grenade like from over to you know Kila one where the only ones we didn't need no help from Lima we could man whatever position Martin 1924 to golf so the way we did that though it was awesome and that paid off dividends been having Jason Sanders and he I didn't have to tell many things except for the clarification how many vehicles came in and get you it was our uh what was it it was corpuself right cat white can't wait because stop was there McManus and so came in with four mix four vehicles four vehicles over watch position we kept them anytime we had a union zone and even while we were out of out of zone uh God for the first two months we had a cat section in zone around the clock as as a ready QRF in case the battalion in the union of a time came in contact there was always someone in zone who could fucking respond well for me it wasn't until cat white came in picked up done them that I actually realized how bad I was hurt like I had got the buddy aid and we eventually got word on that 22nd that Donald passed when he was removed from life support so he lived for eight days from point of injury to being in a roof from life support with his parents at his side and the common honor of the Marine Corps there as well but this was all for us and anecdotal because we're in the middle of it there's no fucking break it was just something else that we had to absorb and when I got the word that evening when we had a break in patrols I pulled the whole company in and gave them the news you know one of the things that that really they this guy Philips he literally interviewed like everyone that came in contact with Jason over that time period and this this story as it unfolds is very well yeah so quick vehicle search that's where you guys are doing pretty straightforward back to the book Corporal Dunham and PFC Miller moved quickly up the street until they came to the elderly white land cruiser which was some 50 yards from the intersection where the alleyway met the road Miller edged along the passenger side and saw the muzzle and wood front grip of an AK 47 rifle poking out from under the floor map he looked up in time to see the driver a young Iraqi man in a black tracksuit open the door and lunge at Dunham people uh the people a lot of people don't know about the mujahadine uniform of the tracksuit the tracksuit so you see the guy in the tracksuit again this is these things you can't when you explain them to people it's almost like a bad movie I mean Rick Ganon Lima Company commander and for the Marines killed an opening stages of the battle for who save on the 17th three days after Donna was hit you know company commander gone just like that so it wasn't a question of if it was gonna happen so at least for me I just resolved that it was gonna happen so once I accepted that it was easier to operate because then you didn't have that uncertainty about whether or not it would happen so it's just like well when it comes to counts it doesn't even fucking do about it yeah we we'd get dropped off we could get we'd get dropped off and they'd go and all right well they go back and support QRF or whatever we wait to go get us or they go check out another spot over on the other side of town while were you satellite to them got it what'd you like better though build did you like better sitting in the home v-way on the start my idea that's what I was felt like one the thing you had for us we weren't rolling in a breaker four to a humpy we weren't high backs so in the back of the humpy there was six of us seven crammed in there we actually have video of one of my small elements was out in Ramadi got to big gunfight they were with some Iraqi soldiers one Iraqi soldier got wounded one Iraqi soldier got killed called in the tanks the tanks went in escorted him put down fire cast of act the home on yards as the patrol and back in one of the Overwatch to seal Overwatch positions was videoing them and as they're coming in like World War II style in a column in between two tanks and their their patrol and back and the video the video cameras like tracking them and you can hear the the Paltoon Chief Tonya Frattie looks up at the camera and yells everything's a big joke that's how so so to your sentiment right so by the time the Marines went on there two weeks Christmas Lea blog the new squad organizations had been announced but the first time that those squad leaders stood in front of their Marines was on the second in January but March Air Force base on the first day of the last five days of a time level training that we were gonna have before we find a deploy so we accepted a degree of risk in it but in the end getting that spread of talent experience leadership and fresh blood spreading it evenly across the company I felt quite confident going into OF2 that I could plug any rifle squad into a mission and they be able to pull it off but he liked the idea of having one in kept it in a holster zip tied to his flat vest up until that point Miller used it mostly to fend off stray dogs but as he ran around the front of the SUV toward Dunham and the Iraqi again foreign fighter he pulled the baton out and snapped it down to his side to extended to its full length Miller saw the Iraqi lying on his back his head toward the rear of the land cruiser Dunham was faced down on top of him torso rotated slightly counterclockwise Miller planned his left knee in the Iraqi's ribs Braising his left hand on Dunham's back he slammed the butt of the baton as hard as he could into the Iraqis forehead the blow was so sharp that the metal baton collapsed back into itself Miller was amazed the man was still conscious much less still fighting he drove the baton into the Iraqis forehead again then jabbed it into the left side of the man's neck a blood choke he had been told would pinch off circulation to the brain through the karate artery Lance Corporal Hampton saw the melee in charge around the van and up the street his adrenaline surging all they could hear was the loud pounding of his own pulse as he searched for an open shot on the Iraqi to hit shoot him in the head he said to himself he aimed his rifle but worried that any shot might go through the Iraqi and hit Miller hell he thought a muzzle pump Marines are taught to poke the rifle barrels into the eyes their enemies to make sure their dead only the dead or comatose could resist flinching when poked hard in the eye with a long piece of metal the muzzle pump could also be delivered to the chest to get someone aggressive to back off without resorting to deadly force Hampton planned to fump the Iraqi in the temple if it knocked him out fine if it killed him that was fine with bill two Hampton picked out a spot on the rigging Iraqis temple and pulled his rifle back to get some force behind it is there a bill for shaking your head I was going to put that thing through his head I was put it through his eye but then it was back to petroleum again right back to it there was no no break and and there was the last thing that I was gonna take was a break right because now now we know what the fucking score is we've just we've lost a Marine on the 9th in a massive ambush now we've lost Donald the rest of the battalion is taking casualties Ramadi is blowing up my good friend Chris Bronsy takes 15th of you actually in the 13th coming commander in two four is in there and they're in a fight for their fucking lives it's going to hell in the hand basket across all of our promise so there was no rest we were in it but but one thing that a lot of people especially civilians don't understand is that they're still missions to do and they're still a work to be done and it the the enemy the when the enemy gets a win they don't back off in fact oftentimes they step it up which means we get no rest from a leadership perspective you guys now looking at your troops going okay here's what happened we have ops to do what did that look like from your all's perspective it was a really busy time we knew that Donald had been cassey backed and eventually it made it back a state side to Bethesda we're in the fucking middle of it and on the 17th all hell broke loose and that was the day that Rick Ganon and for his Marines from weapons particularly McEuney were killed and that that kicked off the battle for his saver and that lasted for three freaking days we came out of there on the on the 19th and so that that was a conventional attack and defense followed by a sweeping clear within the entire town of saver and I remember the thing that I cared about most and the bill was the same way I didn't give two bucks about myself I never asked how I was I never asked how bill was because I could see him how was where's done him how's done him you know that was the only thing I could care about because like I'm I could tell like I'm still talking I can think I'm fine enough I could see Bill he was talking looking at me he was going to be okay and we were talking about Dunham and Sanders tells me a story about a fucking conversation that occurred like two weeks earlier when when Kevlar four was still attached to Lima you know during a break between patrols they were resting in the damn the tune space doing the dark tournament that dark tournament we had the white board up and oh man Jason always at the dark board practicing board just school and people so this this conversation comes up it's the type of conversation that combat Marines have combatants period you take that that metal of honor citation book this is thicker than a freaking Bible in my estimation and I used to read from that thing all time as an instructor at the basic school probably half citations in that damn book are from Marines and soldiers cover the fucking gun and they're I'm like your hand is like his left arm has left arm I'm like no my left arm is fine my right arm hurts and they're like
