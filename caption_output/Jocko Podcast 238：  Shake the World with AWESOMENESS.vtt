00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 238 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So you may have heard me tell a story in the past about a training tool that we used for young seal officers.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So this special training tool was a stick. Not to hit them with, but to give them to hold in place of their weapon in place of their gun.

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If they couldn't detach from their instinct to shoot and replace that instinct with an instinct to lead.

5
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Because the leader's job is not to engage the enemy. The leader's job is to make tactical decisions to direct the troops.

6
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Find the next move that we're going to take. The leader's job is to actually lead.

7
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There is a story. Another story of an ancient Chinese military leader who on the eve of battle was offered a sword from his subordinate.

8
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
From his subordinate leaders, which he did not accept. No, I don't want your sword. I don't want that sword.

9
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Because to him, banners, banners and drums, which is how you would signal back in the day.

10
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is how you would direct troops during this time period. Those were the tools of a leader for him.

11
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And he said to them, to command the troops and direct their blades is the role of a commander.

12
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
To wield a single sword is not his role.

13
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Correct.

14
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This leader was named Wu Qi. He lived from 440 to 381 BC. A philosopher.

15
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Military philosopher, politician, and military leader. He led troops in combat.

16
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Many battles. I want to say that number was like 60 battles. 63 battles or something like that.

17
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000
During the period in history, called the Warring State's period. He ended up becoming the prime minister of the state of Chu.

18
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And there he led a lot of reforms. He was kind of a...

19
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
He was like a default aggressive leader. A little bit radical. He would make things happen. He would fire incompetent leaders,

20
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000
spent a bunch of money on the military, tried to build it up. He eliminated these old, hereditary privileges that they had back in the day.

21
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So you can imagine that's going to make some people angry.

22
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And he did other things that were good for the state, but let's just say against the norm.

23
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Made things happen. On the battlefield and in the bureaucracy. And luckily he wrote down some of these military philosophies in something called the Wu Z.

24
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The WUZ. I couldn't really figure out what that word meant. Other than what was it? Room.

25
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Like in Chinese, the word Wu Z means room. I know that's not what we're talking about here.

26
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I couldn't find any other information about it. So we're just called the Wu Z.

27
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm sure some people will give us some information about that.

28
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But there's a lot of good information in this book once again written in, I don't know,

29
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
sometime before 381 BC. Which is crazy to think about.

30
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
That's crazy to think about.

31
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Yeah. A lot of that time, even though if you look at old pictures, like the old school, black and white pictures,

32
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you're looking at it and it's like dang. That's like, even though we understand what a photograph is.

33
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It's a capture of real.

34
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It's basically capture of light coming through this thing and a record of it, right?

35
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Dude, but what it says is this right here in this little frame right here. This actually happened.

36
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
This was an actual point in time right here. There's the person. There's the people, whatever.

37
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And yeah, you trip out when you find out like how long ago that was.

38
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Yeah, it's weird man. And now think of somebody. This guy, Wu Chi, wrote the Wu Z in 381 BC.

39
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
That's crazy.

40
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The idea of your very existence was not an existence.

41
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yeah.

42
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Not even close to being an existence.

43
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I mean, can you imagine trying to pull the string on your genealogy or to find out where the ancestors were back then?

44
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yeah. It's crazy.

45
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Yeah, and you compare it to who kind of you are.

46
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yeah, yeah, you can go deep.

47
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Another rabbit hole.

48
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Let's go deep in the Wu Z.

49
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
First section.

50
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We're jumping right in.

51
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The need for strengthening domestic and external issues.

52
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And this is sort of set up like a story, which is kind of weird because I don't know if he wrote it this way,

53
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but people captured his words, but it's written not like too much of a story, but it says this,

54
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Wu Chi dressed in confusion, a tire had an audience of the Lord when of way to discuss about military issues.

55
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This is one of those situations where I was like, I don't know, one of those will be good.

56
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I hadn't read it.

57
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
No, I'd like to look at it.

58
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
There's, I think, a seven-inch Chinese war text. This is one of them. Sunsu is one of them, right?

59
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I'd glance through this one, but I couldn't remember enough about it to think, oh yeah, I gotta do this one.

60
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Here's the opening.

61
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So Lord went of way, said, I'm not interested in military affairs.

62
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Wu Chi replied, this is like him saying, hey, wait a second.

63
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I might not be a good call.

64
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
My brother.

65
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
He says, from the visible facts, I can deduce the hidden.

66
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
From the past, I can discern the future.

67
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
How can your Lordship say this topic does not accord with your thoughts?

68
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
He's coming out off the top rope in the opening.

69
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Just in the opening, from the visible facts, I can deduce the hidden. From the past, I can discern the future.

70
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
How can you not want to know what I've got?

71
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Interestingly, you know, echelon front.

72
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Sometimes we'll get a client this way. Well, you know, you're talking a lot about a military stuff.

73
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is what I'm going to tell them from now on.

74
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I'm going to say, wait a second, from visible facts, I can deduce the hidden thing.

75
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So then he continues, this is some of these lines are really.

76
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So then he says this, throughout the four seasons, you have gathered the skins of wild animals, covered them with, with lacquer, painted them with colors, and embellished them with glistening images of rhinoceros and elephants.

77
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So he's talking about making these garments. These really fancy garments. Then he says this, wearing them in winter does not keep one warm, wearing them in summer does not make one cool.

78
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So you've done all this, you make all these fancy things, they have no real purpose.

79
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And he's kind of setting this up to say, moreover, the Lord has ordered the making of 24 feet and 12 feet long halberds, which is like a,

80
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
you're seeing those spears that have instead of having just a point to have like an ax looking thing on it.

81
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. So that's what that is. So he's made. He's ordered to make 24 foot ones and 12 foot ones and had leathers to cover the chariots.

82
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
These chariots are not grand and beautiful. These chariots are not mobile enough for hunting, meaning they're not beautiful. So they're not made for show. They're not mobile enough for hunting.

83
00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So they're made for one thing. He says, I have no idea what you have, what you should have for them. If they are to be used for war, but your Lord does not seek capable people who are adept in using them such a situation is similar to an arresting hen fighting against a fox or a bitch fighting a tiger.

84
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Yeah, this guy's built up some cool looking things.

85
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:26.000
He's a paper tiger, right? Got nobody that knows how to operate these things. Although they have great fighting spirit, they will still die.

86
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000
In the past, the Lord of Chang sang, Clan focused on improving the culture and domestic issues, but neglected military affairs, thereby leading to the extinction of the state.

87
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The Lord of you who Clan was belligerent, thus he focused on military affairs and neglected domestic affairs. He too led the state to extinction.

88
00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So he gives two examples. One guy focused on domestic and didn't care about the military. They fell apart. One was just belligerent and making world a time, but not taking care of the domestic, that fell apart.

89
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And lightning ruler would have used such examples to remind him that he should tend to both domestic affairs and military affairs together.

90
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
When the enemy comes and you do not fight them, such does not count as righteousness.

91
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
When the enemy comes and you do not fight them, such does not count as righteousness.

92
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So the enemy is coming at you, you got to fight them.

93
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And you all, this is a good one. When you only start grieving the death of your soldiers after they have died, such does not count as benevolence.

94
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Man, you got to take care of your soldiers before they die.

95
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And then it says, there, upon Lord when personally laid a mat for Wu Qi and his wife and presented Wu Qi with the goblin of wine, the Lord later invited Wu Qi to the ancestral temple and appointed him as a commander in chief for the defense of the Western rivers.

96
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
He's like, all right, this guy's got some good, put some in charge.

97
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
From then on, Wu Qi altogether fought 76 battles. Oh, I was wrong. He knocked out a couple more.

98
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Winning 64 of them decisively, the other battles result in draw. He expanded ways territory and all directions.

99
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Broadening ways border by a thousand by a thousand Lee, which is about a third of a mile.

100
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:50.000
All of these were Wu Qi's accomplishments. So, isn't it cool that he's just got a record like an MMA fighter? He's like, hey, 76 battles, 64, 64 wins and whatever the number is draws.

101
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
That's his record. This dude's got a combat battle record.

102
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That's freaking legit. All right, now it goes into unity and the people support. So that's the opener. And this thing is pretty straightforward. Pretty straightforward. It jumps goes through pretty succinct sections.

103
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This part's called unity and people support.

104
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Wu Qi said, in antiquity, the ruling who planned to run his state well would teach the Enlightened and Enlightened the people, be close to the people and understand their sufferings.

105
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Do I not talk about this all the time? Like, you got to understand where your people are coming from.

106
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You got to understand their perspective. And you know, I use that.

107
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I don't know if I do think it's it's okay, or do you think that I have some kind of a subliminal problem with the word empathy?

108
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It wouldn't surprise me. I don't know. I guess maybe I did because I always say you got to understand other people's perspective.

109
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That whole word can be replaced with just that whole sentence can just be say empathy.

110
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah, that's what empathy means.

111
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Yeah, I know. I know. So I guess I have some sort of a natural prejudice against that word.

112
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah. You know, maybe it's something where in my mind it sounds too soft.

113
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We're not doing it.

114
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Yeah, like the word, like the word moist. I don't know why, but that I don't like that word.

115
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Yeah.

116
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Even when you know how somewhere, I don't like it when I say it, but other people can say it, but I okay, that makes sense.

117
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I'm not okay, but moist is one that anyone says, what the way it sounds or just the thoughts it gives you.

118
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
But all of the whole deal when someone else says it, like, oh, even like, you know, I step here in the ground and it was moist.

119
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm like, oh, don't say something else, man.

120
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Say damp. I don't know. Actually damp.

121
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Damp sounds drier than moist.

122
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Yes.

123
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You see, it was kind of, I don't know, man, just don't say moist.

124
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Okay.

125
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yeah. And I'll refrain from saying it too. It's kind of that feeling.

126
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yeah.

127
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So that's what we're dealing with here.

128
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes.

129
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
What he's talking about is empathy. What I say is perspective, but we're all saying the same thing.

130
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You got to understand your people.

131
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There are four disharminies the ruler should take note of.

132
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
If there is disharminy in the state, you cannot start a military campaign.

133
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
If there is disharminy with in the army, they cannot be allowed to battle.

134
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
If there is disharminy within the formation, they cannot be used to lead an attack.

135
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
If there is a lack of cohesion during the conduct of battle, you cannot score a victory.

136
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
What does that mean? You got to be unified as a group.

137
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.000
For this reason, the eminent ruler before he employs his people, he would unite them first before achieving great matters together.

138
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The ruler, this is why when you're in a team and you're doing anything that is pulling the team apart,

139
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
you're not doing a good job as a leader.

140
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
The ruler will not dare rely solely on his own plans.

141
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But we'll announce formally at the ancestral temple.

142
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
When I was reading this, I was like, oh, this is going to be decentralized command, but it's not really.

143
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:14.000
You're actually after the announcement of your ancestral temple and then sort of get the divine sort of approval from the heavens.

144
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
That's what it's talking about.

145
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We're just still cool. Like I'm not a down of that, but I was hoping you'd be a little bit more focused on decentralized command rather than the higher power.

146
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
But then he says, people will then know that the ruler value their lives.

147
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Will be sorrowed by their deaths and willing to share, wheel and woe with them.

148
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
New word, W-E-A-L-W.

149
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And what it means is wealth.

150
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Just take the TH off.

151
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
He uses it a couple times.

152
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You bite, it's a great expression.

153
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Got a little little iteration ham willing to share wheel and woe.

154
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So good or bad.

155
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Sickness and help.

156
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
There you go.

157
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Wheel and woe.

158
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I think wheel and woe might be better.

159
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Yeah, I think so.

160
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Officers will then consider death while advancing is glorious.

161
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And life gained through retreating is disgraceful.

162
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So all these things, what does it mean?

163
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You've got to build a tight team.

164
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
You've got to have good relationships up and down the chain of command.

165
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You've got to suffer with your troops.

166
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You've got to reward them when there's rewards to be given.

167
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Oh, good stuff.

168
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That's it. That's on unity and people support.

169
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Next section.

170
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Four virtues of a ruler.

171
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Wichy said, the way is actually knowing is actually how things should be done.

172
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It means it is the means by which one can turn back to foundation and return to beginning.

173
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Righteousness is ethical behavior.

174
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
It is the means by which to achieve great accomplishments.

175
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
What we're analyzing is the means by which to harm distant, keep harm distant and gain benefits.

176
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So you strategize to keep harm distant and you gain benefits.

177
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Principles are which to preserve duty and keep achievements.

178
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
If one's behavior does not accord with the way and righteousness,

179
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
but dwells in magnificent magnificence and enjoys power.

180
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Disaster will inevitably befall him.

181
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You've got to keep that ego in check.

182
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
If you dwell in magnificence and enjoy power, you've got thisaster coming your way.

183
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Thus the wise ruler will run the state according to the way.

184
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Manage the state with righteousness.

185
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
The orders that order the people with propriety and rule the people with benevolence,

186
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
cultivating these four virtues and the state will flourish neglecting them would lead to decline.

187
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, take care of your people and your people will take care of you.

188
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I wrote that in leadership strategy and tactics.

189
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
The expression in the seal teams was take care of your gear and your gear will take care of you.

190
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It doesn't seem like a huge leap to say take care of your people and your people will take care of you.

191
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But man, that's a good thing to remember.

192
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And that's what my boy, Wu Chi, is saying right here.

193
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Take care of your people and your people are going to take care of you.

194
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Righteousness and doing the right things is another thing I do the right things with the right reasons.

195
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
That's righteousness.

196
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Next section, running the state and victory.

197
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Wu Chi said in general, to govern the state and the army, you must instruct them with propriety,

198
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
motivate them with righteousness and instill a sense of shame in them.

199
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000
When men have a sense of shame, one can to a large degree wage a war or to a lesser degree, preserve the state.

200
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
What does that mean?

201
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It reminds me of World War I in England.

202
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Have you ever, I don't know where we talked about on this podcast, they used to give the white flower to,

203
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
if you were a military-aged male and you weren't in uniform, meaning you weren't serving,

204
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and everyone else was going overseas and fighting, they would give you a white flower.

205
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Like a real white flower.

206
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And it was shame.

207
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah.

208
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It was shame.

209
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And that's one of the things that just drove those men to go and fight in that awful war.

210
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Everyone is dying, everyone is being wounded, everyone is being killed.

211
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
It's a total nightmare.

212
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
You know what was worse than that?

213
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Like a shame.

214
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And that's what he's saying.

215
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Scarlet Letter, remember that book?

216
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Yeah.

217
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah.

218
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
That same deal.

219
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Thus it is said that for all strong states those that garner five victories will meet with disaster.

220
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So if you win five times you're going to meet with disaster.

221
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Four victories, you're going to decline three victories, you're going to achieve head-gen money,

222
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
which means you're like kind of in control.

223
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Those with two victories can claim to be kings and those with only one victory will become members.

224
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
For this reason, those who have conquered through numerous victories are rare,

225
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
while those that perished because of it are many.

226
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
This reminds me of the disease of victory.

227
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
It's like the more you win, the better chance you have a fall.

228
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Next, reasons for war and its counter strategies.

229
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Wu Qi said there are five reasons why wars are started and they are to contend for fame,

230
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.000
to contend for benefits and advantages, to seek revenge, internal strife, and famine.

231
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
The names of wars raised based on these reasons are righteous, bully, anger, plundering, contrary.

232
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
The righteous army is raised to save people from chaos, relying on strength or power to bully people,

233
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
such as a bully army, mobilizing an army out of anger is an anger army.

234
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
An army raised to greedily seek profit without consideration for moral and ethics is called a plundering army,

235
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
while the country is in turmoil and the people are exhausted and barking on military campaigns

236
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and mobilizing masses is termed contrary.

237
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Interesting viewpoints?

238
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
A bully army.

239
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Next, section managing troops selecting talents strengthening.

240
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Now we go to a little Q&A from the Lord Wu.

241
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I would like to hear your thoughts on managing troops selecting talents strengthening nation.

242
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Wu Qi said from antiquity, in lighten rulers always make every effort to maintain

243
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
propriety between themselves and their ministers manifest the distinction of rank,

244
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
allow the officials and people to settle into their respective positions that accord with their

245
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
customs, select and recruit talents in order to prepare for the unexpected.

246
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Pretty straightforward.

247
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
He says the ruler of a strong state must evaluate his people first.

248
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And then he breaks this down a little bit.

249
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Those who have courage and strength should be assembled into a unit.

250
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Those who take pleasure in advancing into battle and exerting their strength,

251
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
so as to manifest their loyalty and courage should be assembled into another unit.

252
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Those who are nimble and fleet should be assembled into another unit.

253
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Officials who have lost their position and are eager to make a men's should be assembled into a unit.

254
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Those who have lost in war and want to eradicate their disgrace should be assembled into a unit.

255
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
These five will serve to be the elite troops.

256
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
With 3,000 of such men one can break any encirclement or break into any city.

257
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Those are kind of some cool people to think about, right?

258
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
You know, we got the people that just love to fight.

259
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
We got people that want to prove that loyalty.

260
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
We got people that are quick.

261
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
We got people that have lost their position.

262
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I think those people got to watch out for.

263
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Yeah, I guess I mean on the surface anyway it seems like you have to watch out for some sort of an infighting scenario.

264
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Maybe in some of those but otherwise it's like, yeah, you've sanded out your little elite.

265
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
What is all specialized forces, you know, these guys they like to do this.

266
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
So listen them in under these circumstances, you know?

267
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
It's interesting.

268
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
It's like weapons like tools, you know?

269
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
You know what's it's interesting to think about from like, oh, what you should actually do is understand human nature and know what you're dealing with.

270
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Right? Like you've got somebody that gets defeated.

271
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Somebody that, you know, loses a client.

272
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
How do they react to it? They might be, oh, ready to go boss. Put me in coach.

273
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Right? You might have somebody that gets defeated and gets broken down.

274
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Yeah.

275
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Got to pay attention to that stuff.

276
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Next section, strength and offense and defense, Lord Wu further inquired, I would like to hear your views on making battle formation stable, defensive,

277
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
impregnable and victory in battle certain.

278
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
That's kind of a massive question. How do you make my defense impregnable and victory in battle certain?

279
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Once Wu cheeset that, he replied, Wu cheeset replied, what I am saying is not only for hearing, carrying them out would allow you to see immediate effect.

280
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
So he said, if you did what I said and could put those men together, you're going to get immediate effect.

281
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
He's actually stepping up. He's like, oh, that's your question.

282
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
If you have worthy men hold high positions and relatively less worthy men occupy low position, then your battle formations are stable.

283
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
If people settle down into the respective positions, respect their local authorities, then defense is solid.

284
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000
When the people support the policies of their government and not concerned about those other states, then in battle, you will already be victorious.

285
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
This is a very interesting concept that picture you have a team.

286
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:19.000
This is what happened in the sealed team. Sometimes they put together these kind of superplotoons where they would take a bunch of really good guys and put them in there.

287
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And all of a sudden, what you have is a bunch of alphas in the same platoon.

288
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And do you think that works out well? What's your guess?

289
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Well, the fact that you brought it up makes me think no.

290
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
But why?

291
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Because everyone has a simple answer is like everyone's trying to be the alpha, right?

292
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And I think.

293
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000
But yeah, it's like in a team, just like all those guys, there's different types of guys for different jobs and a team, there's different jobs, typically.

294
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:56.000
So it's interesting that he would say what he's saying is, you know, you put your alphas in there, you put an alpha in there and then you put some betas in there and everyone kind of goes into there.

295
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Natural position is going to be the most positive thing.

296
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Now here's what I'll tell you.

297
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
In life, you're not always going to be putting that situation and you might be the alpha.

298
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And you get put in with another alpha.

299
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
So now what are you going to do?

300
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
If you're smart, what you'll do is subordinate, you go, support that other person.

301
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Or you know, maybe you're just enough, maybe they do that.

302
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
But what you don't want to do is fight with that person.

303
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
You're ruining the team.

304
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Yeah.

305
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
There's things called logical fallacies.

306
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
It's like a bunch of them or whatever.

307
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And that's one of them.

308
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And there are actually two of them that are kind of one is one and then the other is flipped around and it's essentially that.

309
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Where it's like individuals.

310
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Like if an individual is a level five and you get you put three of them in there that makes it a level 15.

311
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
It's not the case.

312
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
It's logically, it seems the case, but it's like a fallacy for that reason.

313
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Yeah.

314
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And then the inverse is right to where it's like if you have a team worth 15, if you just break them up, you got three five's rolling around performing at five.

315
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
That's not true either because they can function better together for that exact same reason.

316
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
But it's like the inverse fallacy.

317
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Yeah.

318
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And if you get what it's called, though.

319
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
You can have a leadership team that just completely compliments each other and they can be unstoppable.

320
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And then you pull one person out of you pull two people out of that team and they fall apart.

321
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Yeah.

322
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Yeah.

323
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Or at the very least level down.

324
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Yeah.

325
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
So yeah.

326
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I mean it makes sense when you think about it.

327
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
But there's so many.

328
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
It's weird.

329
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
I was like reading all these fouls.

330
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
I was like, can't us true.

331
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
That's a whole dang.

332
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And it's because you automatically think these things.

333
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
You know, this is a bunch of them.

334
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
But yeah.

335
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
That makes sense.

336
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Important of seeking talent.

337
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
There was once there was once when Lord Will was planning a state affairs.

338
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
He discovered that none of his ministers could be equal to him.

339
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
After dismissing the court, he wore a happy and satisfied look.

340
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
So he there he is.

341
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
He's running a show.

342
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
He's like, man, I'm smarter than everybody.

343
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
This is awesome.

344
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Woo, she saw that and said.

345
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
There was once Lord Scheng of two was planning state affairs with his ministers.

346
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
He discovered that none of his ministers could equal his intelligence.

347
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
After he had dismissed the court, he looked very troubled.

348
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
A official Shen asked him, why does your lower ship or such troubled countenance?

349
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And then it's already looks so bummed out.

350
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And he said, I am not talented yet none of my ministers are equal to me.

351
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Our state is in deep trouble.

352
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And then when when when Wu Chee tells the story, the guy he's talking to gets embarrassed.

353
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Because what does that statement say?

354
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
That statement says, around your people would bet beef.

355
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Around yourself with people that are better than you, smarter than you.

356
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
That's what that says.

357
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
If you're smarter, if you're the smartest person in the room, you're an allusing team.

358
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
You should feel horrible.

359
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
National next section, National alertness.

360
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Lord Wu addressed Wu Chee.

361
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
At present, King coerces us on the west.

362
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Two encircles us in the south.

363
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Chow collides with me in the north.

364
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And key encroaches us from the east.

365
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Yann cuts off our rear and Han at occupies the front.

366
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
These six states around us and we have to defend against them.

367
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Our situation is precarious and it worries me.

368
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
What can be done about this?

369
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Wu Chee said, in general, being alert of danger is true measure of good governance and

370
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Cheering security of the state.

371
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
As you have now recognized the importance of being cautious disaster can be kept away.

372
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
So all the guys around and he's like, what are going to do?

373
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Pay attention to it.

374
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Nothing too miraculous there.

375
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Next section, providing opportunity for talent.

376
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Within the army, there will be soldiers whose courage is that of a tiger.

377
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Has strengths that he can lift tri-pods easily and has the sweetness of a barbarian horse.

378
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I tried to figure out if there's some root word to tri-pods.

379
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
It's like a stool, a three-legged desk.

380
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I couldn't find that there was some ancient thing that was really heavy.

381
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So we're just going to move that.

382
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
We have to use our imaginations on that one.

383
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
To seize enemies flag or kill enemies, generals you need such men.

384
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
You should select them and put them into one unit, honor them and favor them.

385
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
This is because in their hands holds the fate of the whole army.

386
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Those who are experts in weapons strong and quick and capable and motivated to kill enemies,

387
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
they should be given rank and prominence.

388
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
We should also treat the family well, encourage them with rewards and warn them with punishment.

389
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
This is because such people can solidly hold their position for a long time and exterminate enemies.

390
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
If the ruler can discern and evaluate men described, you can attack double force your strength.

391
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Lord, we've exclaimed great.

392
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
People, you know you get asked that question a lot.

393
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
What do you do when you get the high performers on a team?

394
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Do you focus on them?

395
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Clearly the answer here is yes, and that's usually the answer that I give as well.

396
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
You do have to keep a bench.

397
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
You have to have other people and you have to continue to work to get your bench to become high performers.

398
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So you don't ignore the bench.

399
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
When you get to an opportunity to give them some playing time, give them some playing time.

400
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
But definitely focus on those.

401
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Once that are definitely going to get up there and make things happen.

402
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Enemies you can attack next section.

403
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Woochi said in general when evaluating the enemy, there are eight conditions under which one engages battle without doing an assessment.

404
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
You don't have to think about these. These are no brainers. These are go criteria.

405
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
In violent winds and extreme clothes, they arise early and are on the march while barely awake and breaking ice to cross dreams.

406
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So these guys are cold, they're miserable and they're tired. You can just attack them.

407
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Next one, in the burning heat of summer, they arise late and press forward with haste through hunger and thirst, concentrating on reaching far off objectives.

408
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You see them? Attack them.

409
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
The army has been out in the field for an extended period. Their food supplies are exhausted.

410
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
The people are resentful and angry.

411
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Numerous bail for potence or rise with the officers unable to squash them.

412
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
You see them? Attack them.

413
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
The army's resources have been already been exhausted. Firewood and hair scares.

414
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Weather frequently cloudy and rady.

415
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And if they even wandered up plunder for supplies, there's nowhere to do it.

416
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Clear hot attack them.

417
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
The troops that are mobilized are not large. The terrain and water are not advantageous.

418
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
The men and horses are sick and worn out with no assist from their allies.

419
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Attack them. The road is far off in the sun and setting.

420
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
The officers in men of labor long and are fearful. They are tired and not eaten.

421
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
They're just cast aside. They're armor. Attack them.

422
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
The generals are weak. The official irresponsible.

423
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
The officers in troops are not solid. The whole army is frequently in fear.

424
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And the troops lack assistance. Attack them.

425
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Their formations are not yet formed. Their encampment not yet finished.

426
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Or they are passing through dangerous territory. Only half their troops are out of it.

427
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
In these eight conditions, you can attack without any doubts.

428
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Enemies you cannot attack other end of the spectrum.

429
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
There are six circumstances without performing too much assessment you should avoid conflict.

430
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
The land is broad and vast. The people are wealthy and numerous.

431
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Avoid conflict.

432
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
The government loves the people. The ruler.

433
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
The ruler's goodness extends and flows to all.

434
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Isn't that an interesting one?

435
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
When you have a ruler that takes care of his people, don't even attack him.

436
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Think about that. Think about that as a leader. How you treat your team?

437
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
When you treat your team well, when you take care of your team, the enemy shouldn't even attack you because they know what's going to happen.

438
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
You're reading from a paper right now.

439
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Where did you get that? Obviously, it's a book.

440
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I got it from the depths of the internet.

441
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Was it like a PDF situation?

442
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
No.

443
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
You know, I don't. I see a lot of times in my life.

444
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
When I'm browsing the internet, when I find a good document,

445
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000
I just download that document or copy paste it and I put it into this file, which is called books and PDFs.

446
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000
So in this thing, books and PDFs, sometimes I'll go, oh yeah, I'll see something remind me of it or I'll think of it.

447
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And I'll just go and go in there.

448
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:59.000
And that's where I forget where this actually came from, because it was just in my personal file that says books and PDFs, which is filled with ancient military documents.

449
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
It's an F field manuals and that's where it came from.

450
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
So it's the, I'm sure you could go Google it and you'd find it on the internet somewhere.

451
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Hmm.

452
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Just, yeah.

453
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Number three, rewards and punishment system is fair and transparent and is implemented in a timely fashion.

454
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
You shouldn't even attack somebody that treats their people fairly and transparently.

455
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Think about that.

456
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Number four, people are rewarded according to their accomplishment and the talented are an able are employed.

457
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Got a talented team, we're not going to play.

458
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Forces are massive and well equipped, I think that is pretty self-evident.

459
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
They have assistance of all their neighbors in the support of a powerful state. Okay, cool.

460
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So those, those were maybe both those sections, little obvious.

461
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Well, which makes you wonder why you have to say it.

462
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And I know the answer to the question that I just asked the reason that you have to say it is because people still don't.

463
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Even execute on things that seem really obvious.

464
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Like, hey, where the forces are massive and well equipped, we should not attack them.

465
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Go look at history as obvious as it is people do it all the time.

466
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Yeah, one of those things where it's like, okay, are you going to work hard or are you going to work smart?

467
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
I'm really both, I get it, but you know, when people are faced in the mix and it's like,

468
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
work hard, work smart is kind of like, okay, not a lot of people say, I mean, I don't

469
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
want to say not a lot, but I'm just saying there are people, let's say on a normal level,

470
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
quantity wise who are going to be like, hey, hard all day and turn their back on the smart part.

471
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
You know, I guess it seems understandable. Yeah, if you know, I mean detached, it's kind of like,

472
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
sure, I'm going to play this the smartest I possibly can.

473
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I'm just for sure, but I'm going to play this the smartest given how much force I have.

474
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Big small, whatever. Yeah, the follow that makes sense, but I don't know, I guess it's maybe not the most obvious.

475
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Here's the deal. It's so obvious from the outside. Right.

476
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
It's watching a movie. It's watching a lame horror movie where you're watching the girl, you know,

477
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000
with the hero noise downstairs in the basement. Everybody knows she goes down their barefoot, like super obvious.

478
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Yeah, but this happens all the time, not just in movies. People do dumb stuff. A lot.

479
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
People do dumb stuff. A lot.

480
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Let's do.

481
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Check if in general, if you are no match for the enemy in these areas, without a doubt, avoid them.

482
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
This is what I meant by C possibility and advanced knowing difficulty and withdrawal.

483
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
So, if you see possibility advance, if you see difficulty withdraw, pretty straightforward.

484
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Next section, detecting the enemy's situation. Lord Wu inquired from the external appearance.

485
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I would love to be able to know their internal situations from their advance.

486
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I would know their objective from these. I am able to predict victory or defeat.

487
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
What is your opinion of this?

488
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Wu Qi replied, if the enemy approaches in large numbers, but in disarray, their flags and formations are a mess,

489
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
and the troops frequently look about.

490
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
But using one tenth of their strength, we can invariably cause them to be helpless.

491
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
So, if they're just looking rag tag, no factor.

492
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
If reinforcements, if reinforcement has not arrived, there is disunity within the troops.

493
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Preparations for defense has not been completed.

494
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Orders and rules have not been announced. The morale of the army is shaken.

495
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
They cannot advance a retreat. You can defeat the enemy with half of the strength that never lose it all.

496
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
What's interesting about this perception is, when my first opponent to Iraq, we were running around and thinst,

497
00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:09.000
in Humvees, meaning there was no armor. It was just super sketch. And one of the things we did, we would actually brief that everyone was responsible for scanning targets, looking,

498
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
and making our convoy look like a convoy that you don't want to upset.

499
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So, we called it the porky bind of death.

500
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Because we had guys in the back of our home, we had articulating weapons.

501
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
So, we had weapons mounted, crew serve weapons mounted on articulating arms.

502
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You've got one of those on each side. You probably had another couple machine gunners in the back.

503
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Anyways, they've got their weapons pointed out. Everyone has got a weapon pointed out of that vehicle.

504
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
You've also got the turret going to accept for the driver. The driver's the only one that's not pointing a weapon.

505
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:56.000
So, those were some, if you were looking at that, you see five humvies, and you see, I don't know, there's six guns on each humvie.

506
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And some of them are heavy caliber weapons, belt-fed machine guns.

507
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000
As I'm thinking about it even right now, I'm thinking if I was an insurgent, I would probably wait till the next convoy where it's all buttoned up.

508
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:19.000
You know, people are sitting inside, they're looking straight ahead. We turned to our seats on the humvies because we now have doors. We turned the seats to face outwards.

509
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Yeah.

510
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000
For two reasons, one, so that we could see and have a better angle to shoot, but also because there are chest plates of our body armor, we'd be then facing the enemy.

511
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
As opposed to sitting where they shoot you in the side.

512
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
But just imagine, you know, we would ride like our, we're facing sideways.

513
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Yeah. And our feet are out of the vehicle and we're just scanning for targets. And so when you see these humvies, you think, you know what?

514
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yeah.

515
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
That's not messing with these guys.

516
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Gun barrels pointing at you, no matter where you are.

517
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
No matter where you are.

518
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
We call that, that was our posture.

519
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Yeah.

520
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And we wanted to have an aggressive posture, and we most certainly did.

521
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
We also, you know, and those were the, were the Mad Max days.

522
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So we welded these big crazy, you know, bumpers on them and we'd put tires on the front. So we could just get aggressive.

523
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Yeah.

524
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Get aggressive while driving.

525
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And my point is we didn't, we got to ambush a few times, but when you consider the amount of time we were on the road, I think there was probably quite a few.

526
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Insurgency, enemy that decided maybe they'd wait until the next convoy.

527
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Next up, weaknesses you can attack.

528
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Are there circumstances where the enemy can invariably be attacked?

529
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Lord Wu and quiet?

530
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Wu Qi replied, in employing the army, you must ascertain the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.

531
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
If you spot an opportunity to attack, attack his weaknesses,

532
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
below are the situations you can attack an enemy.

533
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
When the enemy has just arrived from afar, and their battle formations are not yet properly formed and deployed.

534
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Again, this is going to run through a list of things that seem really kind of obvious.

535
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
If they have just eaten and not let yet establish their encampment, they can be attacked.

536
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
If they are on the move and the troops formation is disarray, they can be attacked.

537
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
If they have labored hard, they can be attacked.

538
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
If they had not seized advantages of the train, they can be attacked.

539
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
When they have not seized any critical, the critical timing they can be attacked.

540
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
When their flags and banners move about, chaoticly, they can be attacked.

541
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
When they have traversed a great distance, their supplies and reinforcements just arrived in the whole troops have not rested.

542
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
They can be attacked.

543
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
It goes on.

544
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
When crossing the river and only half of them across, they can be attacked.

545
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
On treacherous terrain, on narrow roads, they can be attacked.

546
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
When formation trains frequently, they can be attacked.

547
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
When a general is separated from his soldiers, they can be attacked.

548
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
When they are afraid, they can be attacked.

549
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
In general, in such circumstances, select crack troops and make a swift attack on them.

550
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Divide remaining troops and continue the assault repeatedly.

551
00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Factors in using troops, Lord Wu asked, in using troops what is primary?

552
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Wu Qi replied, first, you need to be clear about the four principles of lightness,

553
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
the two principles of heaviness and the one principle on integrity.

554
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Lord Wu asked, what are they?

555
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Wu Qi said, these are kind of cool.

556
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
The four principles of lightness means the terrain that the horses, the terrain feels that the horses are light.

557
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
The horses will feel that the chariot is light.

558
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
The chariot will feel that the soldiers on it are light and the soldiers feel that the burden of war is light.

559
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And he breaks his down a little bit more.

560
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
The terrain feels that the horses means that one should choose a suitable terrain that would not hamper from the enemy.

561
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
That would not hamper the movement of the horses.

562
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Thus, the terrain would feel that the horses are light.

563
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000
If the horses are properly fed, they will be strong in thus when they are pulling chariots, they would feel that the chariots are light.

564
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
If the axles of the chariots are well-oiled, sturdy and properly maintained, they can move soldiers easily.

565
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Thus, the chariots will feel that the soldiers are light.

566
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
If the soldiers have sharp weapons and their armor are sturdy, they will feel confident about winning.

567
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Thus, the burden of war will be light.

568
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So, there's the four lights.

569
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
For the courageous that advance, they should be rewarded heavily.

570
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
For those that retreat, they should be punished heavily.

571
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
So, there's the two heavies.

572
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
There are four lights, two heavies, and the last one is integrity.

573
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
There are two principles.

574
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
These are the two principles of heaviness.

575
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000
As for integrity, it refers to the integrity of rewards and punishment system.

576
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
If the rulers to take note and implement these principles, the troops can achieve victory.

577
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
It all kind of starts with picking good terrain.

578
00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Man, it was a so much focus if you're in combat arms, so much focus should be all in understanding terrain.

579
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And then as you map that into the civilian sector and jobs and businesses, you need to understand what the terrain is.

580
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
What's the market like, where are people located, where are your competitors?

581
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
What is their encampment like?

582
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
You can translate this stuff.

583
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And you can utilize terrain.

584
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
That's the thing.

585
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
terrain on the battlefield is the best weapon, right?

586
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
It's like positioning in jiu-jitsu.

587
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
When you get the right terrain, it's like you have good position in jiu-jitsu.

588
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.000
When you get good terrain in business, you have that kind of massive advantage.

589
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Gaining control of the army.

590
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Lord, who asked what measures will ensure the soldiers will be victorious?

591
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
This guy's asking these questions.

592
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
This is kind of like those questions that are, hey, how do you pass the ID pass the guard, right?

593
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
It's like how do you get around their legs?

594
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
You know what?

595
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Go on there.

596
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
But Wuchi has an answer because Wuchi's not playing.

597
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Control is foremost.

598
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Lord, who asked again, is it not a matter of numbers?

599
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Wuchi says, if the laws and orders are not clear rewards and punishments not met, meet it out.

600
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
When the sounding of the gongs will not cause him to halt or the beating of the drums,

601
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
will not make them advance even if you have a million men what you saw they.

602
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Control is achieved by training and management.

603
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
At any time discipline is strict and during war, they move and attack with all.

604
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Their advance with draw, stride is measured the left and right, look out for each other, even if we cover move.

605
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Even if broken off from the main order, they preserve their formations decentralized command.

606
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Even if they scatter, they will reform lines.

607
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
The whole army is very united and share wheel and whoa together.

608
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
When they are employed, they do not feel tired.

609
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000
No matter where you dispatch them, no one can withstand them, such armies are called the father and son army.

610
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Doesn't go any more detail about the father and son army.

611
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000
But that whole thing, you know, decentralized command discipline.

612
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
When they are employed, they do not feel tired.

613
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Think about that.

614
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Think about that.

615
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Think about that year in your personal life.

616
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
You can be tired going into a workout and mentally tired.

617
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
I'm tired, I want to go to sleep.

618
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
When you start working out and you're actively engaged and not tired anymore, I never feel tired when I'm actually doing something.

619
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Seriously.

620
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
That's crazy, right?

621
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Yes, it is crazy.

622
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
I mean, I have to stop doing something and then I can get tired.

623
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Takes about 40 minutes.

624
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Yeah, actually that makes sense.

625
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
But it does depend on what kind of tired you're talking about.

626
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
So, you know, how there's like the three tires?

627
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
I don't know about the three tires.

628
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
I know that one is obviously physically tired.

629
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
So when you're working out and you're doing your third set of burpees as fast as you can.

630
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Yeah, that's a different kind of time.

631
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
So you can, um, that's one.

633
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Is that one?

634
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Is that type one tired?

635
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
That's type two and three tired.

636
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Yes.

637
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Okay.

638
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And keep in mind, I said the three tires, like it's this known thing.

639
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
The type three, the three types of tired is the three types of tired that I recognize myself.

640
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Okay, so this is the echo trough the principles.

641
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
The ancient principles of echo troughs.

642
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
There's sleepy tired.

643
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Well, fatigue is a general sleepy tired.

644
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Sleepy tired.

645
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Is that the doctrinal name for it?

646
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
That is sleepy tired.

647
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
It's so far.

648
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Yes.

649
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Uh, that's the one you're talking about.

650
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Where you're a little sleepy tired, but you're not the other two kinds of tired.

651
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
You can just warm up a little bit.

652
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Get the blood flowing.

653
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
You know, maybe boost some adrenaline in some capacity and you're rolling your good to go.

654
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
You stop.

655
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
You're going to go back to sleepy tired a little bit.

656
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Then there's like, then there's lungs tired, meaning like my muscles are working, but I'm

657
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Breathing so hard that I, that like relief is like you just need.

658
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
He need really from that.

659
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
So you got to rest whatever.

660
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Long time sleepy tired.

661
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Long time tired.

662
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
And then we have muscular tired.

663
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
The killer tired like straight up musk is.

664
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Can't believe this bar anymore.

665
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Yeah.

666
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
You get to like all of those kind of come into play.

667
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Where sleepy tired?

668
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Yeah.

669
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
So you can be sleepy tired before you get on the mass, but once you start rolling, it goes away.

670
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Okay.

671
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
That's how you recover from sleepy tired in your juice.

672
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
You just to sleepy tired comes before the roll.

673
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
You're the same thing.

674
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000
So now in your get to you can have a guy who has fast pace guy and you'll be long tired.

675
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Like you'll be like, like, this guy's sure.

676
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
But muscular.

677
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
You can still push him.

678
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
But you're just breathing so hard and he gets you in some kind of claustrophobic situation.

679
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
You're in big trouble.

680
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Depends on who you are of course.

681
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
But if you're muscular fatigue tired, you're not like breathing hard.

682
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000
You know, like, I mean, that I guess typically happens if you're like really not in shape and you go like a few rounds, you know?

683
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Or if you're just been rolling all day.

684
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Well, the well, I tell you where I get muscular tired is like you either are giving or receiving a singular move for an extended period of time.

685
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I.e.

686
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
You get my arm and I'm defending for four and a half minutes.

687
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Muscular tired.

688
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Yeah, you can't.

689
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Yeah, and it applies to you muscular tired too.

690
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
By the way, yeah, right?

691
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Of course, because it happens to both of us.

692
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Yeah, fully and it'll, you know, obviously dependent on how good a shape certain muscles are, muscle groups, whatever.

693
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And it can apply to individual muscles or parts of your body or your whole body.

694
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Like you ever felt like, probably body is it all getting up.

695
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
It's like, it's like your whole body is muscular tired.

696
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
But you're not breathing hard or nothing.

697
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
You just like, oh, I'm dead, you know, kind of thing.

698
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
It's like, you know, if you roll for like a long time that tends to happen, it makes.

699
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
It makes.

700
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Yeah.

701
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
But yeah, that's three times of tired.

702
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Three types of tired.

703
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Ancient echo Charles doctrine.

704
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
You.

705
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Fully sleepy tired.

706
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
That's my favorite one, bro.

707
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Sleepy tired.

708
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Because you know, that's the same word, right?

709
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Uh, well, you know, because depends on what you mean, not necessarily.

710
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
I guess you know what?

711
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
The Eskimo's have what, when they always say the Eskimo's have a hundred words for snow or something like that.

712
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Well, the winds of two words for water, so it's like, okay, what?

713
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Well, actually there might be more, but there's water like on a river and there's the ocean water because they're like different things, you know, in their mind, even though they're made the same liquid, whatever, each two, oh, because sometimes the salt in one of them, but.

714
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
No less.

715
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
You see how they can be different.

716
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Yeah.

717
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
From a certain approach, you seem saying, do they know the two Hawaiian words for water?

718
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Yeah, a Hawaiian guy.

719
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Which one's which?

720
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Vies river water or like lakes or, you know, like what's what, if you were going to ask for a drink of

721
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
water, what would you ask for?

722
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I don't know.

723
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
That's another one.

724
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
That could be a whole different thing.

725
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Yeah.

726
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
You might want to know the interesting.

727
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Back with our people.

728
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Yeah.

729
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Figure out what the deal is there.

730
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Oh, yeah.

731
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And that's why like there's a lot of like towns and even names or whatever they'll have Kai in them or five.

732
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
It's actually five, but it's spelled WWE.

733
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
So Kai, K-I is the ocean water.

734
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
That's their referring to the ocean waters.

735
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Lots of people named Kai too.

736
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Exactly.

737
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Right.

738
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Kai, something, you know, or it could be part of it, you know, like you can, you can have names like,

739
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
you know, Kai Noah or, you know, Kai Lani here, this and that.

740
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
And Kai Lani roughly translates to beautiful ocean.

741
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Lani is like beautiful or you know, loving or something.

742
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
You know, there's a bunch of translations for sure.

743
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
We're not putting you on this spot.

744
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Yeah, I'm digging deep in my, you know, Hawaiian right now.

745
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
But nonetheless, yes, Kai.

746
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
If you say, Mokai, that's like a position slash location.

747
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
That's what I mean towards the ocean.

748
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
That's towards the ocean.

749
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Yeah.

750
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
If they mouth, that means towards the mountain.

751
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000
The mountain side.

752
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Yeah, mountain side exactly.

753
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
But anyway, yes.

754
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Three words for tired, two words for water, you know, Hawaiian and, you know,

755
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
cool.

756
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Here you go.

757
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
All right.

758
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
We're going to go with that.

759
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
I like it.

760
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Next one notes on marching armies.

761
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Woo Chi said in general, the way to command a marching army is not to contra interbene,

762
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
not to contraen veen the proper timing, advancement and stopping.

763
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.80
Not missed the appropriate times for eating and drinking and not completely exhaust the strength of the

764
00:53:17.80 --> 00:53:19.000
mountain horses.

765
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
These three are the means by which troops can undertake the orders from their

766
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
superiors.

767
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
When the orders of the superiors are followed, controlled, achieved, if advancing and

768
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
resting are not a proper timing, the drinking and eating are not timely.

769
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
When the horses are tired, the mental weary are not allowed to relax and in camp.

770
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Then they will be unable to carry out the commanders order.

771
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
If they're unable to carry out the order, they're going to be defeated.

772
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Dave Burke got asked.

773
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Good do that.

774
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Yes.

775
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Got asked a question today on EF online.

776
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And this one guy named Evan was asking, you know, hey, my team right now needs to get after it.

777
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Big down.

778
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000
And we can't take a break, but people are burned out.

779
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And if we don't keep going right now, we're not going to make it.

780
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And Dave Burke, he said, well, do you really, do you know what I mean?

781
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Really?

782
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
And then the guy said, you know, it's like a marathon.

783
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
We're in a marathon.

784
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
If we stop, we won't finish.

785
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.000
And Dave's works like, actually, you can be in a marathon and you can stop.

786
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
And you can still finish.

787
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Actually, you can take a break.

788
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
And then you want to, he say, Max Q. Oh, yeah.

789
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
So there's three modes of speed in a jet fighter.

790
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Max Q is we're going as fast as we possibly can.

791
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Max R is, hey, our range is, we're going to go as far as we can, which I'm, because obviously,

792
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
if you're going as fast, you can, you might not be able to go as far because you're burning

793
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
more fuel.

794
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.000
And then the last one was Max E, which was, I think it's Max efficiency, meaning we're just going to stay flying as long as we can.

795
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Gotcha.

796
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
And so he said, you got to know him to push.

797
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
You got to back off. Then he pushed for a second, then he back off.

798
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
That he's, and Dave was saying almost never.

799
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Well, he would, he said all the time. They would be constantly going between Max Q, Max R, Max E,

800
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
and just going back and forth between these things real quick.

801
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
One more time, Max Q.

802
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Yeah.

803
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Is that far can we, how far?

804
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
No, sorry, Max Q is as fast as we can possibly go.

805
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
And then Max, I don't know if the normal is Max.

806
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Yeah, it's Max Q. Max R is now, it's just, yep.

807
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
And then the last one was Max E.

808
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:57.000
So R is as far as you can go straight up, whatever speed we're just trying to get there, trying to, we're trying to get as far as we can.

809
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Yeah. And then Max E is like basically as far as fast.

810
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
No, Max E is staying in the air.

811
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Like we want to be able to stay in the air.

812
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Gotcha.

813
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Because there's an optimum time where we might be going slower, but we're saving a lot of fuel.

814
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Okay.

815
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
And if we went faster, we could go further, but not as long.

816
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
We just want to stay in the air.

817
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Okay. I understand. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

818
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
It's kind of like jujitsu, right?

819
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Yeah.

820
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Yeah. In your body, you have similar energy systems too.

821
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Yeah.

822
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
What is it?

823
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
An aerobic aerobic?

824
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Like a rocket.

825
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
And then aerobic.

826
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
An aerobic.

827
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Lactic acid.

828
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
And aerobic.

829
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
A aerobic.

830
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Yeah.

831
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Three systems.

832
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah.

833
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And there are blend.

834
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
It's not like, you know, they blend into each other kind of things.

835
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
It's not like, oh, you know.

836
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Next one, decisiveness.

837
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Woochi said, in general.

838
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I'm going to change my voice a little bit.

839
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Yeah. I think we got to go a little heavy on this one.

840
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000
In general, on the battlefield, soon to become a land of corpses.

841
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
If the soldiers are committed to fighting to death, they will live.

842
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Whereas if they seek to stay alive, they will die.

843
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Excellent.

844
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Got to be aggressive.

845
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.000
If you're scared of dying, the chances of dying increase.

846
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000
A general, a good general act as if they are on a sinking boat or trapped in a burning building.

847
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
There is not enough time for the war to, for the wise to make plans or the courageous to get angry.

848
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Only thought that one can have is to fight.

849
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Thus, it is said that the greatest harm can be fallen army.

850
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Is the result of hesitation while the disasters that default the whole army is a result of too much doubts leading to slowness.

851
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:05.000
What a patency, a good plan executed now is better than an imperfect plan executed in two weeks.

852
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Those are good ones.

853
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Education and training of armies, Wucci said in war men constantly perished from their inability and are defeated by unfamiliar.

854
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Thus, when deploying troops, training should be given the priority.

855
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
One man who has been trained in warfare can instruct 10 men.

856
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
10 men can train 100 men, 100 men can train 1000 men.

857
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
1000 men can train 10,000 men.

858
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Can train a whole army.

859
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Use the advantage of being near to counter enemy that comes from afar.

860
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Use the advantage being well-rested to counter an enemy that's been labored.

861
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Use the advantage of being satiated to counter the enemy that is hungry.

862
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Having them from deploying in circular formations and change to square ones have been set.

863
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Then get up and move and hold.

864
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Have them hold.

865
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Move left to right, right to left.

866
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
He's talking about how to train these people.

867
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
How have them divide and combine.

868
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
You unite them and disperse them when all these changes are familiar.

869
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Provide them with weapons.

870
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000
All these mentioned are great.

871
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
I used to do this with, I did this all the time.

872
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
I would take my seal, puttune, take my seal, task, you know.

873
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Go on in the beach.

874
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000
We wouldn't even have, we would just be wearing PT shorts and pairs, whatever, sneakers.

875
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:30.000
And get in our patrol formation and then go contact front, contact right, contact left, set up fuel, peel right, peel left, and call these random calls.

876
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
And people just have to figure it out and you start going, you come with me.

877
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Here's a new call and people start taking ownership and people start making things happen.

878
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
You start seeing this and you start seeing decentralized command.

879
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
By the time you would get to, let's say, land warfare and we'd thrown all this chaos at all these guys.

880
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
And they got used to making things happen.

881
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
It just seemed easy.

882
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Yeah, they almost seem like we were cheating.

883
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Yeah.

884
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Do you run into, like, in the beginning of say that kind of exercise, whatever, like kind of a chaotic kind of scenario for sure.

885
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And then what, you just sort of, what, give them guidelines or work through it.

886
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Like, but you coach them up, like, after you little.

887
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I might, but work through it.

888
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Because as you work through it, you're getting better.

889
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And we, now we would have a debrief, you know, maybe go through it.

890
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Oh, okay.

891
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Or 10 little mini maneuvers.

892
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And this is, you know, the classic one is you, you call your first call and everyone knows what to do.

893
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And then you let that start to get executed and rise is getting executed.

894
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
You call a different call.

895
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Oh, yeah.

896
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Then as that one's getting soon. Now you got confusion times one.

897
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Then you call a different thing.

898
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You get confusion times two.

899
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Now we're all split up.

900
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You're, you know, you're used to be your fire team being bill Fred and Joe and all of a sudden you're not with Bill Fred and Joe.

901
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And a matter of fact, you're a junior guy and everyone in your fire team that you randomly end up as all junior guys as well.

902
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
No one knows that any step up in charge finding you look around and say, I got to make a call right now.

903
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Hey, fire team.

904
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So on me, we're going to bound forward.

905
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Ready move and you, the guys listen to you.

906
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Why? Because they're starting to adapt to the situation.

907
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
So they, so we all start off with like pretty clear guidelines super general, but pretty clear.

908
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Every seal knows what to do when you say contact front.

909
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Gosh, everybody knows what to do.

910
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And then you say center peel. Everybody knows what to do.

911
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Everyone's done that drill a thousand times.

912
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
But then while they're doing the center peel, you say contact rear.

913
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And then you, so now they're jumbled up, but then you call another call.

914
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And then you say contact rear.

915
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And then you say the tactical call for we're going to flank them.

916
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And now people start to work the flank, but they're with a different group.

917
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And now as that flank is happening, you call contact front or contact rear again or contact left or contact right.

918
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And now we've got to start to orient to this new situation.

919
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And so you just keep doing all these different calls and it makes people think.

920
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And like I said, it felt like I was cheating because by the time we would get to land warfare,

921
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
they would throw the problems at you.

922
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The problems would not be problems because we already scrambled our brains over and over again.

923
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And everyone knows how to look around and figure out who to grab it.

924
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Hey, if I'm alone or I'm no one's in charge of calling to grab three guys where we're a fire team.

925
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
We're going to move.

926
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Oh, that's so interesting. That, like, because okay, I used to put football and press the exact same thing.

927
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So what, you know, you heard of all the lines, Scrims, you're going to call an audible, right?

928
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Well, basically all that means is I'm changing the play because of the defense I see or whatever.

929
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And then there's little maneuvers you can do. You can be like, I know we know this team plays this certain defense or whatever.

930
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
So we're going to line up a certain way. That means they're going to line up a certain way.

931
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And then we're going to call the audible on the line.

932
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Because we already know where we're going to shift to and then right when we shift, we're going when we shift they have to shift to but they're reactive.

933
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
So they got to make all these decisions right there right place. So you catch them off guard like that.

934
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So now imagine if you did that three times in a row four times five times in a row.

935
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And then they're going to have real problems.

936
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

937
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

938
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

939
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

940
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

941
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

942
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yeah.

943
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But that's crazy how like seal team practice and training or whatever.

944
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Like the parallels with like basically team sport because basketball do the same thing.

945
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Same exact thing.

946
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You know, it looks different on the field obviously is a different sport but they do the same thing.

947
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah.

948
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And I think for for the takeaway is like to just being a leader in general.

949
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
What you're putting your putting your troops in a situation that they're not familiar with.

950
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
They learn how they learn to protocol.

951
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
They learn how to deal with those situations.

952
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Which I wrote about in in.

953
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
In the code.

954
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I wrote about how do you handle a situation when you don't know what to do.

955
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
What do you do?

956
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Well, I'll just break it out right now because we're here.

957
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Because it's a good protocol.

958
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It's a very.

959
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And it's a it's a protocol that you have to follow upon the most because it's the unknown.

960
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Right.

961
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The other protocols are straight forward.

962
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
You know, here's the problem.

963
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Here's the solution.

964
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
This is the unknown.

965
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
What do I do?

966
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I don't know what to do.

967
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Something bad happened.

968
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I don't even know where to start.

969
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
This is this this is the strategy protocol.

970
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Every scenario cannot be addressed.

971
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So this is the protocol for what to do when you don't know what to do.

972
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
One start by taking a step back to touch.

973
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Take a breath.

974
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Look around.

975
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Make sure you assess everything that's happening.

976
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So this is what's happening when you're in a sealed tune and there's three calls just got made.

977
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And now you're in the unknown.

978
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
You don't know what to do.

979
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Take a step back to touch.

980
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Take a breath.

981
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Look around.

982
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Make sure you assess everything that's happening.

983
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
That's exactly what you should do.

984
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Next thing about where your possibilities are in decisions you could make right now and what could happen.

985
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So now you look around and say, okay, what could we do?

986
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Could we go to that berm over there?

987
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Could we go to that little ravine over there?

988
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And here I say write it down because we're in an administrative situation.

989
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But then you look at, okay, what is this success look like?

990
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Does that get us where we want to be?

991
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Can I get there?

992
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Can I make that happen?

993
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And then you work the plan.

994
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Make a call.

995
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And you want to make small.

996
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Does it make a small step towards what you think is the right decision?

997
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And that's what I read about in in leadership strategy and tactics, which is the inner of decision making process,

998
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
which is making small steps in the direction that you think is correct.

999
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And yeah, and then you assess if that was a good call or not.

1000
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And you saw the ravine.

1001
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
You started moving towards the ravine.

1002
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
There's doesn't seem like you're taking any further contact from that area.

1003
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So you can keep moving there.

1004
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So you make another call that continues you pushing in that direction.

1005
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But what happens is everybody on the team starts to realize how to, how to do all those little steps.

1006
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
So that new guy that when you walked out on the beach for the first time,

1007
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
this guy has no idea.

1008
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And what's cool is this is an adryl that you had to run every single day.

1009
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You could run this drill like three or four times.

1010
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And then people would just be good enough where, you know, you're like, okay, we got this.

1011
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And they're, they are,

1012
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I was going to say 10 times better.

1013
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And then I was going to say 1000 times better.

1014
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But then that sounds, sounds unrealistic, but the, but the actual number is,

1015
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
when you walk out on the beach for the first time as a new guy and you've never done this before,

1016
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
you're zero.

1017
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
You're zero.

1018
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You, when that first call, when the, no, when the first call gets made, you go,

1019
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
cool, I know what to do.

1020
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
When the second call gets made, you're at a zero.

1021
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
You have no idea what's happening.

1022
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So when, when you've done this now for three hours one morning,

1023
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
when you're done with those three hours, you're a whole new man.

1024
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You're a whole new man.

1025
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You're ability to process what's happening.

1026
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You're ability to figure things out.

1027
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You're ability to grab two or three other people, put it in your fire team and start making,

1028
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
making, taking action to support whatever calls being made.

1029
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You're totally different human being in three hours.

1030
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Which is amazing.

1031
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah, that is.

1032
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And by the way, the only training that, the only equipment that you need is a pair of shorts

1033
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and a stick, and you can say bang bang.

1034
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Next, placing individuals in appropriate positions,

1035
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
woo, she said the basic rule of warfare that should be taught is that men of short

1036
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
statures should carry spears and, and spear tip, halberd.

1037
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
The tall should carry bows and crossbows, the strong should carry flags and banners that

1038
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
courageous should carry bells and drums.

1039
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The weak should serve in logistics, the wild the wise should be involved in

1040
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
planning.

1041
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
People from the same village or district should be grouped together so they can look out for

1042
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
each other.

1043
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I got a kind of a kick out of that one.

1044
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's, if you think about, you know, once you're carrying guns, a lot of the physical

1045
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
differences between humans go away.

1046
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
You know, not, not that they go away completely.

1047
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I was thinking about the other guy, a text from one of my civil friends that,

1048
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
you know, a guy that I grew up with and the teams, and he's just a incredible beast of

1049
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
a specimen of a human being, right?

1050
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And I remember I was watching, we were doing a training operation, we were down in the

1051
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
jungles of Louisiana.

1052
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And we were doing a raid, a live fire raid.

1053
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So we're using really real bullets and I was in the base element, which is the cover element.

1054
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So I was not going to move.

1055
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I was laying there and this is generally the place for the radio man, generally the

1056
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
first place for the platoon commander that you're going to sit next to the platoon commander

1057
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
and you usually would be looking at rear security and then you, so you put down cover

1058
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
fire and then the assault element moves into position and then assaults through the target.

1059
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And you ship fire, they move through anyways, the point of all this is that they had this kind

1060
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
of semi cheesy target set up for us.

1061
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
There was some couple plywood building, some barrels and there was a picnic table, a random

1062
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
like picnic table was in there.

1063
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And I'm watching the silhouette of this assault happen.

1064
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And I see my buddy and he's like six four and just sort of just overall general beast of

1065
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the dude and a great athlete.

1066
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And I see him, he's carrying an M60 machine gun.

1067
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
This was before the modern machine gun that we have now.

1068
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So this is a big, normally it's a crew serve, it used to be a crew served weapon.

1069
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Meaning you have a person to carry the weapon and a person to carry the ammunition and sometimes

1070
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
a person to carry the tripod.

1071
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
We had him with bipods, we had modifications to them.

1072
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
But in the seal teams, you carry those weapons by yourself.

1073
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So he's got this big giant weapon and I'm watching him and he gets to this picnic table.

1074
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And he's shooting because they're shooting, it's a live fire.

1075
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And we have now shifted fire, we've actually now ceased fire.

1076
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
So we're no longer shooting, we're just watching them move through the target.

1077
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And I see him, he's carrying this giant M60 and it looks like he's carrying a BB gun.

1078
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Because he's just big and he's just laying down fire.

1079
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And he steps up on this on this picnic table as if he was stepping over an ant hill.

1080
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And I'm like, if this dude was born to be doing what he's doing right there with that pig, that pig gun.

1081
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So that's what I was thinking about when I thought of this section right here, that you know,

1082
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and you know, look, you're point man, a lot of times the point man on these small guys,

1083
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
hey, the Vietnam point man, they were legendary, those be the small seals right?

1084
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Hey, that guy's going to be point man, the big dumb new guys, you're going to be a 60-garner, right?

1085
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
They still kind of carry this stuff out.

1086
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And of course, it's not a written in stone and you can definitely be, there's plenty of guys that have been very small and

1087
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
carried in heavy machine gun.

1088
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
There's plenty of big guys that have been point man, but we do, you know, there's a little bit of it.

1089
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Because he makes sense. Yeah. He makes sense.

1090
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
When you say pig, what does that mean? Does that mean the M60 or does that mean just a big gun?

1091
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That means it used to mean the M60, but now it also means the Mark 48, which is the new modern version.

1092
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It's a big belt fed machine gun to put it in clear terms for you.

1093
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
The iconic Rambo weapon.

1094
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And Commander Belt fed machine gun.

1095
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I don't know about Commander No kind of weapon he was carrying in there.

1096
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
He's shooting everybody from the hip, carrying the bullets, right? The belt.

1097
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yeah, other hand.

1098
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Fet machine gun. Yeah.

1099
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Rambo, I think, kind of did it before Commander, if I'm not mistaken.

1100
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Yeah. When he came back, you shooting up the office. Oh, yeah.

1101
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So picture that weapon.

1102
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I mean, because, well, now you can picture it with sliced alone, right?

1103
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Yeah. Do you know how tall Solester Stallone is?

1104
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Oh, I'm not exactly, but I know that he's not as tall as, like, you know, you're guy.

1105
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Yeah.

1106
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Exactly.

1107
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You can picture my buddy, just laying down.

1108
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And by the way, having that thing shoulder, like shoulder like a rifle and just laying it down as he's moving.

1109
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
As he's walking over an obstacle, like it's no factor.

1110
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000
No, and I'm totally picturing it. And yes, that's a glorious vision for sure.

1111
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Right there.

1112
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
When I was young, we were watching Rambo and Commander.

1113
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
See, and I was young, we were doing assaults with life fire in the swamp.

1114
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Yeah.

1115
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
You were watching Rambo. Yes, and death.

1116
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Completely different for sure.

1117
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
No, I think it's pretty much the same.

1118
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
More or less, yes.

1119
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And my dad commented on that.

1120
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
He said, because he saw, if I'm not mistaken,

1121
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger in commando, because that's when we watched together.

1122
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And he had it. Yeah, shooting from the hip one hand holding the bell.

1123
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
The bell is the other bell to the other hand.

1124
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And he's just laying down. He's just moving down everybody, right?

1125
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
He's just moving down.

1126
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And I was like, oh, man, that's impressive.

1127
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You see that gun that he's carrying right there?

1128
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah.

1129
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
He's like, that gun.

1130
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It would take me, you and then he named like our neighbor.

1131
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
He's like, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1132
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
He's like, it would take all three of us to pick that gun up.

1133
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And I was like, that's how he got me.

1134
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger holding the old one hand.

1135
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So it's interesting to say that, because damn, that's what my dad said back in the day.

1136
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah.

1137
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I mean, you can, you can definitely do it on old.

1138
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And so when a guy's would do that, too, but the pig, so yes, that heavy machine gun, the heavy belt

1139
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Fed machine gun is generally referred to as a pig.

1140
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Yeah.

1141
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And therefore, the guy that's carrying the pig can be no can call it the pig gunner.

1142
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And then if you remember Ryan Job was a pig gunner, and usually guys have a nickname for their pig.

1143
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And as a matter of fact, the guy that was stepping over the picnic table, he, his pig, he had two of them.

1144
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I'm not sure which one of them was called Frankenstein, but the other one was called Roadblock.

1145
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And this is, this is, you know, this is in the 90s, but there's no work on, but let's face it.

1146
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Roadblock is a legit name.

1147
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Yeah.

1148
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
So Ryan Job's Ryan Job's nickname was Biggles, and his, his gun was called Pigles.

1149
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So his pigles and Biggles.

1150
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Roadblock is from GI Joe.

1151
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
What, that's the name of a weapon?

1152
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
No, of a guy.

1153
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Okay.

1154
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Or, no, no, no cops.

1155
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Might be cops that that don't.

1156
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I don't know.

1157
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I just know that my buddy had a, had a, had a them 60 that was called Roadblock.

1158
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That's, yeah, that's one of the most legit names of it.

1159
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
My life straight up.

1160
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Yeah.

1161
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I'll tell you what.

1162
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
So, so every different military has their different schools, right?

1163
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Your different skill sets, sniper, radio man, you know, medic, all, they're, they're all, they're all little schools.

1164
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And we used to share schools.

1165
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
We know sometimes our radio man go to the, go to the special forces, communication school,

1166
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
we've, for a long time with special forces, medic school.

1167
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
So we share some of those schools, sniper school, there's a Marine course map.

1168
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
There's all different schools. We, the seals run really, really good schools.

1169
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Because you get guys that are way, way, way into it, way into it, way into whatever their little thing is.

1170
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But we would run that the machine gunners would go through a course.

1171
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
While we would go through land warfare, and it was like this, this, the 60 gunners course,

1172
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
or the pig gunners course.

1173
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But man, they would get some of the instructors, and they would, everyone was just so into it that,

1174
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000
and I, I would, the other guys, like I when I was a radio man or one, I was an officer,

1175
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
we would get, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd do some a couple runs.

1176
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Because you got to, but these guys would be out there for, you know, three days,

1177
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
just burned in through ammunition and learning to do everything in slap feed and push feed and combat feed.

1178
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And, you know, it just, the guys would get so good.

1179
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And you'd see, there's another, another friend of mine I had.

1180
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I was, it was almost the exact same situation.

1181
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I think I was behind him, we, I was walking on him, so we were assaulting through a target.

1182
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And he was out ahead of me, so I wasn't, I was like, as the radio men, so I wasn't,

1183
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
as a radio man, you're, you're doing time on target.

1184
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
You get like the nerve rolls, you know the stereotypical, so the stereotypical,

1185
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
60-gonna, he's like a big jacked guy, right?

1186
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Even in every movie, right?

1187
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It's, it's the way it is.

1188
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
The stereotypical radio man, what does he look like?

1189
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Yeah, a little nerdy.

1190
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
He's a nerdy guy, he's got glasses on, he's just keep cleaning him in the fields.

1191
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And, and so, like, I was, I was not, I mean, I wasn't small,

1192
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
but that's the job that I had was that nerdy job.

1193
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So when you're assaulting a target, your job would be to keep time on target.

1194
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So you'd call out, you know, one minute.

1195
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And, and so you're, while the assault's going down,

1196
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
sometimes I would be tracking out kind of, I would be a little bit more heads up,

1197
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I'd be a little bit more attached, right?

1198
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I got three machine guns out of front of me, plus all the other guys with the P shooters,

1199
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and they're all laid it down, and I might take a step back to be, okay,

1200
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I'm making comms, I'm making sure we're doing good, whatever.

1201
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
But I was watching one of my other buddies.

1202
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And I just, like, he was, so there's a, there's a feed tray.

1203
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
There's a bunch of different ways that you can reload your M60.

1204
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And I just remember him.

1205
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
He, in the most smooth fashion that you could imagine.

1206
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The particular, he was, he was slap feeding it, so he opens up the feed tray.

1207
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And he opens up the feed tray, and he whips his hand.

1208
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
He whips his hand, and what he does when he whips his hand is he hits the links.

1209
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So, you know those bullets in the belt, they're held together by links.

1210
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And that, when you fire that last round, sometimes that link will sit there.

1211
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It won't make it out of the gun, because it just fired.

1212
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And so that link will sit there, right in that spot.

1213
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Yeah.

1214
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So he opens up the feed tray, whips his hand, and he hits that,

1215
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and that link comes up, he opens it up, link.

1216
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And while he's whipping it, he's like prepping, he whips it.

1217
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
He whips it, he switches hand, he grabs out his,

1218
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
or no, he whips it, he grabs the belt, puts the next belt in there.

1219
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Boom, slaps the feed cover home, lip in he starts, and I was like, man.

1220
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, what I'm saying is when you got people that are into what they're doing,

1221
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
they're going to be good.

1222
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
They're going to be good.

1223
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
You want it, that's why if you, we should have videoed those two guys.

1224
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Do in those two moments, if I could capture those two moments,

1225
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and just propagate those two moments to the world.

1226
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
People will be a lot less apt to want to mess with America.

1227
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Because you think about what kind of humans are doing this.

1228
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
What kind of human is figured out how to open the feed tray cover,

1229
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
slap that link out, reach down, like, what kind of human is doing that?

1230
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And it's made that into a beautiful thing.

1231
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
That's what you're dealing with.

1232
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Not dealing with normal people.

1233
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
We're going distance.

1234
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's like, you know, those guys who, you know, they're into smoking.

1235
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You know, so they, and I don't mean like they're just smoke-living,

1236
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
saying they're into smoking, you know, so when they like this cigarette,

1237
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
they got the old school classic gold-plated light,

1238
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and they do the little mini micro performance before they like this cigarette,

1239
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
the thing, you know, flip it like it's a butterfly knife or something like that.

1240
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Kind of like that.

1241
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But, yeah, as far as a war fighter goes, you see.

1242
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Yeah, and then you just break down.

1243
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And when I start thinking about all the little details that guys would do,

1244
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.000
every little piece of gear, their honing at their pep, their prepping at everything is taped,

1245
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
everything is quiet, everything is just,

1246
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and you'd get to see these, I'll tell you what, I was out on patrol,

1247
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
like towards the end of the battle of the body.

1248
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So, you know, we're like, I don't know, maybe a few weeks or whatever from going home.

1249
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And I run to some corner and I'm holding the corner as, you know,

1250
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
whatever, we're just on patrol, and I'm watching as the guys are moving,

1251
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
and I'm like, good, good.

1252
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Same thing, I'm thinking, if I was an insurgent,

1253
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I would, there's no way I would take a shot at these guys right now.

1254
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It looks like a, looks like just a machine, a machine, a machine that's alive,

1255
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:40.000
like a cyborg, a cybernetic organism that's conducting operations with one thought process.

1256
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yeah, that cannot be bargained with and cannot be reasoned with.

1257
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Oh, yeah, does it feel pity or remorse or fear?

1258
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yeah, absolutely will not stop.

1259
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Never, and that's what you are, like that's from a movie, but that's real.

1260
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Yeah.

1261
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Think about that.

1262
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That's a movie.

1263
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Somebody wrote that for a movie to make that as cool as possible,

1264
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
but that's a real thing.

1265
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
There's really, really people like that.

1266
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I know them.

1267
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And there's groups like that.

1268
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And look, the only thing is you can say, they can't be killed or whatever,

1269
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
as did you say that, or they can't be stopped?

1270
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Can't be bargained with, can't be bargained with, or reason with cool.

1271
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Yep, we're there.

1272
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Yeah.

1273
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So it's just a good comforting feeling to know that there's guys out there like that.

1274
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
They're like that.

1275
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Yeah, I know JP to know.

1276
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I know him for a while.

1277
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
For sure.

1278
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
He's always come off as like that.

1279
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Yeah.

1280
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Yeah.

1281
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Good times.

1282
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Good times.

1283
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Well, a little fun fact.

1284
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Michael Bean is the guy who played Kyle Reese, who is the character who said that whole thing to

1285
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Sarah Connor in Terminator 1.

1286
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And we might call this layers.

1287
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
We might call it coincidence.

1288
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
We might call it parallels.

1289
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But his most played role is a Navy seal.

1290
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Interesting.

1291
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Yeah.

1292
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Be a Bist, the rock.

1293
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
There are others too.

1294
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Anyway.

1295
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Next section maintenance of horses.

1296
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
This is an interesting one.

1297
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I'm trying to remember why I highlighted that I should read the must be some reason.

1298
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Lord, we asked, how do we take care of our horses?

1299
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Woo-chee replied, the stable should be clean and comfortable.

1300
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
That's why because it applies to everything.

1301
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The stable should be clean and comfortable.

1302
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The horses should be fed with appropriate grass and water.

1303
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Feeding should be until neither too hungry or too full.

1304
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Oh, yeah.

1305
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So this is like a decademy here.

1306
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Not too hungry.

1307
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Discipline, clean.

1308
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Right.

1309
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Not too hungry.

1310
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And then the decademy is continue in winter.

1311
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
They should have warm tables in the summer.

1312
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Cool tables.

1313
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Little decademy there.

1314
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
They're made and here should be kept trimmed.

1315
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The hooves are properly cared for.

1316
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Yes.

1317
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
See these guys, these are like pig gunders.

1318
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
But with horses, right?

1319
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
They should be trained to be familiar with all sights and sounds.

1320
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So that they aren't easily startled.

1321
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Practicing their gallop and pursuit exercise.

1322
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Constraint and vat and halting.

1323
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
The bond between the horse and men should be so strong.

1324
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Before the horses can be employed, imagine the bond between a pig gunner and his weapon.

1325
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Right?

1326
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
It's like a real thing.

1327
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
The equipment such as saddles, bridles, bits and reins must be strong and durable.

1328
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Normally these horses are injured either towards the end of war or at the start.

1329
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Similarly, they are either injured by hunger or overfeeding.

1330
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
That's the same thing that Dave Burke said about crashes.

1331
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Playing crashes.

1332
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
They usually happen in the first 20% of a pilot's career or the last 20%.

1333
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Management of troops, Wu Qi said, only people who have military capabilities and civility

1334
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
can be commander of an army.

1335
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000
He must be one who is strict and flexible as well.

1336
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I thought I made up the dichotomy of leadership.

1337
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I didn't.

1338
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
In general, when people appraised general ship they usually focus on courage.

1339
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
However, courage is one of many required characteristics of a general being only courageous.

1340
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
One would rash you rushing to battle without any considerations for gain and loss.

1341
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
What do you need to be balanced?

1342
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Such action is not acceptable.

1343
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Now, the affairs to which the general must manage are five.

1344
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
First is control.

1345
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Second is preparation.

1346
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Third is commitment.

1347
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Fourth is caution.

1348
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Fifth is regulation.

1349
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Control is governing the masses just as one controls a few.

1350
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Preparation is during the journey to the battleground.

1351
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Always be prepared for enemy ambush.

1352
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Commitment means entering combat without any concerns for one's life.

1353
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Caution means that even after conquering one remains the same control and attitude as if just entering a battle.

1354
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Hmm.

1355
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Even after you win you maintain control and you maintain the same attitude as if you just entered the battle.

1356
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Regulation means laws and orders are to be kept to a minimum and not abrasive.

1357
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You know what I've been saying lately?

1358
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Lead with the minimum force required.

1359
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Hmm.

1360
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Which is exactly what this says right here.

1361
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Or just kept to a minimum, not abrasive.

1362
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
To accept command without declining.

1363
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
To accept command without declining.

1364
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
So when you get put in charge, you do it.

1365
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Destroy the enemy only afterward.

1366
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Destroy the enemy and only afterwards speak about returning.

1367
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Is the proper form of behavior for general.

1368
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
You look, you don't talk about going home.

1369
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You even mention going home until you win.

1370
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.000
When the army goes forth, his only thought is to die with glory rather than live with shame.

1371
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Hmm.

1372
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Lead you.

1373
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Woochi said, oh sorry, this is for areas to note and characteristics of good generals.

1374
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
What?

1375
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Over 2000 years old.

1376
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Woochi said in general, there are four vital points to note for warfare and they are morale.

1377
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Terrain, affairs and strength.

1378
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000
The control and management of armies movement lies in the hand of one general.

1379
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
That is the vital point for morale.

1380
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
When the road is narrow and perilous at the vital point of the mountain route.

1381
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Deploying 10 men, a general can stop an army of thousands.

1382
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That is a vital point of terrain.

1383
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Making full use of spies, using light cavalry to harass the enemy,

1384
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
so in discord between the ruler and officials and higher ranks and lower ranks,

1385
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
approaching each other is the vital point of affairs.

1386
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
When chariots and strong have strong axles and secure pins, the boats have been suited with runners and ors,

1387
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
that officers are thoroughly familiar with the formations and the horses have trained in pursuits and maneuvers,

1388
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
such as the vital point of strength.

1389
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
One who knows these four is qualified to be a general.

1390
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Moreover, his reputation, virtues, benevolence and courage must be respected by his

1391
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
abordinates and calm the masses.

1392
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000
It is interesting that you think of these guys back in the day of these rulers being

1393
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
really ruling with an iron fist and it is the caste system and you are just dominating.

1394
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And he talks about benevolence all the time and righteousness.

1395
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And how that's he's saying, if you've got a group that loves their leader,

1396
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
don't even attack him.

1397
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Furthermore, he must be able to scare his enemy with his reputation and decisiveness.

1398
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
When he issues orders no one dare to bit disobey him whenever he may be,

1399
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
wherever he may be, rebels will not dare to oppose him gaining such a person.

1400
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
The state will grow strong, losing him, the state will perish.

1401
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
That's what we call a good general.

1402
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Characteristics and importance of good communications.

1403
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Will she set?

1404
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Now the different troms, goans and bells are means to all the ear.

1405
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Fags, banners and penance are meant to all the eye.

1406
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Prohibitions, orders, punishments and fines are meant to all the mind.

1407
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Since the air is awestruck by sounds, they must be loud and clear.

1408
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Since the eye is struck by colors, the colors must be discriminating and bright.

1409
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Since the mind is awestruck by penalties, it has to be strict and impartial.

1410
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
If these three are not established, even though you may have the support of the state,

1411
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
you will invariably be defeated by the enemy.

1412
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Thus it is said that wherever the general's banners are, the whole troops will go

1413
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and wherever the general points to every and will charge for without concern for their own lives.

1414
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
As much as we talk about communication, it's under the law of combat simple, simple, clear, concise communication.

1415
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:20.000
If you're not doing that, if you're not giving clear, concise orders, things are going to fall apart.

1416
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Wooch, knowing the enemy general, knowing the enemy general, wooch, he said, in general, one essential of wars to know who the enemy general is and evaluate his talent.

1417
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.000
In a corner of the situation, you schemes and achieves, you schemes to achieve results without much later, labor,

1418
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
a commanding general who is stupid and trusting can be deceived and entrapped.

1419
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:56.000
When who's greedy and insensitive to honor, can be given gifts and bribed, one who changes mind easily and lacks real plans,

1420
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
plot to labor and tire him out.

1421
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
That's a good one.

1422
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You got some of that tries, all these different things, go ahead and keep trying, all those different things.

1423
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Nice little breakdown, he just gives about what kind of personality you're doing with and then how you attack that personality.

1424
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
It's so good.

1425
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:20.000
If the upper ranks are wealthy and arrogant while the lower ranks are poor and resentful, so discord amongst them.

1426
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:27.000
If they're advancing and withdrawing are often marked by doubt and the troops have no wonder of lion, they can be frightened off.

1427
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
They can be frightened and running off.

1428
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
If the officers despise their commanding general and have strong intent to return home,

1429
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:42.000
block off the easy roads leaving the treasurer's ones open and they can be attacked and captured. If the terrain over which they advance is easy, but the retreat route is difficult,

1430
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
wait for them to come forward.

1431
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Testing the enemy general.

1432
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Lord Wu asked,

1433
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
If two armies are confronting each other and I do not know their general,

1434
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.000
if I would like to know more about them what methods can I employ, Wu Qi replied, gather some lower ranks,

1435
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
men who are courageous and have them lead some light shock troops to test them.

1436
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:18.000
When the enemy responds to attack, they the shock troops should run off and he basically goes through how to do little probe to find that.

1437
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:26.000
What kind of reaction you think of an organized defense or not, and you can judge from there, next one chaos and communications.

1438
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Lord Wu asked, if the chariots are sturdy, the horses are well bred, the generals are courageous and the soldiers are strong,

1439
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000
but when you suddenly encounter the enemy and the troops are thrown into chaos and formations are broken, what can be done?

1440
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.000
So this is exactly what I talked about doing these sand rattle battle jittles on the beach.

1441
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Wu Qi replied, in general, it is a rule of battle that during daylight, flags, banners and pettons to relate orders while at night,

1442
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
longs, drums, horns and whistles can be used instead when the flags sing the left, they move left when the flags are right,

1443
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
they move right when the drum is beaten, they advance when the gongs sound they retreat at the first sound of the horn,

1444
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.000
they should advance at the second sound of the horn, they should gather if anyone disobeyed the order, they should be executed.

1445
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:18.000
This is where I started to say, okay, you know, we talked about the level of lents and I was on board, we talked about taking care of your people and I was on board.

1446
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:27.000
People disobey your order, execution might not be the best thing to do, only in this way the army would submit to your awesomeness.

1447
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And the officers and soldiers will not dare disobey orders and combat, no enemy will be stronger than you, no one will any defenses remain impregnable to your attack.

1448
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
When the, when outnumbered by the enemy, Lord Wu asked, what if our troops are outnumbered?

1449
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Wu Qi replied, avoiding gauging them on flat terrain instead of attacking their recorders,

1450
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
less to disobeyed for one to attack ten nothing is better than narrow passage.

1451
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Pretend to attack a hundred nothing is better than deep revient, these are pretty straightforward.

1452
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
How do attack a strong enemy?

1453
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Lord Wu asked if their forces are numerous well trained and courageous behind them are dangerous high grounds on the right or mountains on the left or river.

1454
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
They are well fortified and have crossbows and defending position.

1455
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.000
When they withdraw, they are steadiest mountains when they attack their like torrential rain as their food stocks are plentiful.

1456
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It will difficult to defend against them for very long what should be done.

1457
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
This is funny.

1458
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
He's just asking these totally insane situations, right?

1459
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
But don't worry, have no fear because Wu Qi replied, a very good question.

1460
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Such enemy cannot be overcome by force alone, but by the wisdom of sage.

1461
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:49.000
If Ken prepared 1000 chariots and 10,000 cavalry and support them with foot soldiers, divide them into five groups, each one traversing a different route.

1462
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Now the five groups will move out in different directions simultaneously.

1463
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
The enemy will certainly be confused and will not know what we are up to.

1464
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
So he basically goes through how to attack from five different directions at the same time.

1465
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And then what he says is, he basically want to isolate some of the groups, which is a smart move.

1466
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:16.000
He's on to a whole section of when surrounded by the enemy, when caught non-favorable terrain, caught in a valley, fighting marine battles, wet and dry weather.

1467
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Also known as moist, this dry weather, fighting plunders after caught.

1468
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
This is a good one.

1469
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:32.000
After conquering cities, Wu Qi said, in general, there is a principle to follow when attacking the enemies city.

1470
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:42.000
That is, after conquering the city, enter their public building, control and use the former bureaucrats to take over their supplies.

1471
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Relay orders that troops are not supposed to cut down trees, destroy houses, take the grain, slaughter animals, or burn people supplies.

1472
01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:00.000
This will show the populace that you do not have any vicious intentions, accepting those that accept those that surrender and settle them.

1473
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000
This is very good advice, especially that bureaucratic idea.

1474
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
We're going to take over and try and maintain their society.

1475
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
We're not going to rip it apart.

1476
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
It's going to be easier to control.

1477
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
It's going to be more beneficial to you and them.

1478
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It's a positive thing.

1479
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:29.000
This is going back to the Iraq War and the disbanding of Saddam's military, which is pretty much now considered that that was a bad, bad move.

1480
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
We talk about it on.

1481
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
We talk about it on the other podcast.

1482
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:53.000
The newly named podcast, the podcast, formerly known as the thread, which is now known as the juggle unravelling podcast, which will be up soon.

1483
01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And just to go, look, we don't have to take this from a war scenario.

1484
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
When you acquire a business, your business buys their business.

1485
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
What do you do?

1486
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Say, we're here, get on board, fire all their leadership, and then actually utilize their leadership.

1487
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Take some of their culture, incorporate them into the game.

1488
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You know what makes people not do what I just said, because there you go.

1489
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
They're like, you know what echo?

1490
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:29.000
We just bought your company, your fired, or even like, you know, you can be, you can be work as my, you know, whatever.

1491
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I'm going to take your authority away from you.

1492
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Now, everybody's looking at you that should be working hard, and they're going to outman that treat our boss bad.

1493
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Yeah, it's true.

1494
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
You know, good examples of that is the movie invasion of the body snatchers.

1495
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.000
So this old school movie, by the way, my dad used to be super into it, but I noticed the aliens that come down and they take over your body.

1496
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Right.

1497
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Now, there's this movie called invasion of the body snatchers.

1498
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So they come down and they take over your body, but you look still, look like you.

1499
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
You kind of even act like you, but you have an alien agenda.

1500
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
See, same same exact same thing.

1501
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
So as opposed to like, because the alien came invaded your body, took over your body, your whole thing.

1502
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But they didn't like ruin it, they kept your whole industry.

1503
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Yeah, because for us, that that philosophy goes as opposed to like men in black, everyone's men in black that one.

1504
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Yeah, but I can't really remember.

1505
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So there's this cockroach alien that came in, like took over this farmer guy's body and just jammed it up.

1506
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:41.000
So when this guy, the farmer, the alien, the cockroach alien was walking down the street as the farmer, like his body was so jammed up his skins all falling down.

1507
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Whatever everyone was like, ooh, like he couldn't function in society, same same. So this agenda was, it was way harder to execute, same same ended up losing in the end two, by the way.

1508
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Okay.

1509
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Yeah.

1510
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Coincidence, nope.

1511
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
No.

1512
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
They kind of stole that plot line from Wuchi.

1513
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Yeah, obviously.

1514
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Alright, Lord Wu asked, is making punishment severe and rewards clear adequate for victory?

1515
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Wuchi replied, as to these matters of severity and clarity, I do not have all the answers, even so they cannot be totally relied on.

1516
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:29.000
When you issue orders and the people willingly follow them, when you raised the army and mobilized the masses, the people take pleasure in going to battle.

1517
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:39.000
When engaging the enemy, the people take on pleasure in fighting to the death, then these three are what the ruler of men can do.

1518
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Those are big asks.

1519
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Lord Wu inquired further.

1520
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
How does one attain such results?

1521
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Right?

1522
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So this is a big ask that you're asking for how do you get there?

1523
01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Wuchi replied, you should identify man of accomplishment and honor them with a grand feast, also invite those that have not accomplished anything.

1524
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
This would stimulate them.

1525
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:13.000
They're upon Lord Wu had sitting on a head sitting mats set out in the ancestral temple hall arranged in three tiers and held a feast for officers and chief officials.

1526
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Those distinguished by great achievements sat in the first tier and were feasting in the finest food and call the re-those who ranked in the next accomplishment sat in the middle tier and dined with fine food and less lavish vessels.

1527
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Those who had not accomplished anything.

1528
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Noteworthy, sat in the last tier feasting fine food in ordinary utensils when the feast was over and they came out Lord Wu also honored the parents and families of the meritorious outside the temple gate again according to their accomplishments.

1529
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:50.000
He annually sent emissaries to call on the families of those who had died in service for the country but stowing aid on their parents.

1530
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
So doing he showed that they would not be forgotten.

1531
01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Once again take care of your people and also like how he set up that little tiered structure of you want to move into the next tier.

1532
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Gotta go make some stuff happen.

1533
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And also interesting to that third tier that is actually sounds still pretty solid, you know, where it's like,

1534
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I'm gonna take a dive in on the finest food just in some ordinary cut, you know, kind of thing but then you compare to like the lavish top tier. We all want to get there.

1535
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Check this is the last section from Wuji. I read a bunch of a didn't read the whole thing. You can go download it yourself for the details. This is the last section.

1536
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And this tells a little story and now we get to this point the day before the battle Wuji spoke to the troops.

1537
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:55.000
All aids and officers must confront and capture enemies chariots cavalry in infantry. If the chariots do not make prisoners of the enemies chariots, the cavalry do not make prisoners of the enemies cavalry,

1538
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:07.000
the infantry do not make prisoners of the enemies infantry, then even if we forge an overwhelming victory, no one will be accredited with achievements.

1539
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:22.000
That was his message to the troops on the day of battle, although his orders were not onerous. Meaning he'd give these massive words. He just said that right there basically on that day.

1540
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000
His awesomeness shook the world.

1541
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:38.000
That is the last line of the Wuji written by Wuji on that day of battle. His awesomeness shook the world.

1542
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And I'm going to say that that's probably a pretty positive outcome.

1543
01:41:44.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And you know, look, these principles, we read them. We have some level of understanding of them. We see the same advice coming from different people over a spread of thousands of years.

1544
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:09.000
We keep hearing the same type of advice over and over again. Well, we didn't use put that advice to work, right? Put these principles to work.

1545
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Just for yourself, but for your family, but for your people, but for your team, but for your employees, your bosses, your community and the world.

1546
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And then what you do is you go out and you shake the world with awesomeness.

1547
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Echo Charles. Yes, sir. Speaking of shaking the world with awesomeness.

1548
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yes, how can you help us do that? How can you help us shake the world with awesomeness?

1549
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Well, you cannot shake the world with awesomeness if you are not yourself providing awesomeness.

1550
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
If you're incapable of providing awesomeness, how can you shake anything with that awesomeness?

1551
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Yeah, you're not shaking anything with pure lack of awesomeness yourself. You're going to have a hard time.

1552
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
What's interesting is even back then they say the word awesome.

1553
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Remember this is the translation.

1554
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Okay. All right. That's fair enough.

1555
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So awesome is so my friend Anthony. He was actually on my house our first episode of the podcast when you came up with it.

1556
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Oh, yeah. He was on my house.

1557
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Anyway, he used to always say the word awesome.

1558
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Just inappropriate times in my opinion. Right. So that kind of turned me off to the word awesome.

1559
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.000
He'd say, yeah, I met this girl. She was just so awesome and it's like, all right. You know,

1560
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I don't know how like a girl. She this girl must be really something if you're in awe of this girl.

1561
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Seems same because that's really what awesome is. Right. It's awe.

1562
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So whatever. Anyway, so he'd always use it. So it really turned me off.

1563
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
So I tease him about it. So anytime he's around, I'd be over using the word awesome.

1564
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Then after a while, I just started using it normally. You know, you know, how that happens, right?

1565
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I think he talked about this before. Where you start using the word just as a joke.

1566
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And then it slowly creeps into your normal vocabulary. That's what awesome is.

1567
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
So I'm rolling with it. Okay.

1568
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
So apparently, woo cheese won't roll with it as well.

1569
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Yeah. Very nice.

1570
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I'm really going to roll with it. So all right. Well, we got to keep ourselves in the game. You know, this game.

1571
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You cannot be awesome and shake any world or anything with awesomeness if you're not in the game to begin with.

1572
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
If you're not on the path, this might be an end.

1573
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
What's the level of arrogance when you close out your book by saying you shook the world with awesomeness?

1574
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Kind of detracts with a message a little bit.

1575
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Oh, well.

1576
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
The humility meter is not getting very high when you're saying, hey, you know what I'm going to do.

1577
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
No factor. Just no big deal on both of them over here shaking the world with awesomeness.

1578
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Yeah.

1579
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:05.000
If I agree, but I've never even heard a person make a statement that is, that might be the strongest possible.

1580
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
What what what what's stronger than that.

1581
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Like what's a stronger way of saying this person made a mark on the world, right?

1582
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Yeah.

1583
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Shake the world with awesomeness.

1584
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Straight up, shook it.

1585
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah.

1586
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Oh, it's legit.

1587
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000
It does sound like a Kanye West, maybe statement or something like this.

1588
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Okay.

1589
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
That's something he would say. I'm saying.

1590
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Okay.

1591
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Oh, I will take your word for it.

1592
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Anyway, be on the path.

1593
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
So I'm saying now what you're going to do is, okay.

1594
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
The path is like, it's full of, and I'm kind of quote you on this one.

1595
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
It's full of obstacles and traps.

1596
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
The path is true.

1597
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
So those obstacles challenges or whatever.

1598
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
We've got something for you.

1599
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Got some supplements.

1600
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
This is for your physical and mental ability to stay on the,

1601
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Yeah, to stay on the path in the game, etc.

1602
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
So, Joaquil, feel kind of lying for you for any pretty much any element,

1603
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000
pretty much generally speaking it covers at least a little bit of any element that may be bestowed.

1604
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Basically, you're just going up.

1605
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
You're just carrying the theme forward.

1606
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Because we are shaking the world with awesomeness. Now we're just any element.

1607
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I'm just, you know, I'm just more good.

1608
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
You got the Joaquil fuel.

1609
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Whatever's wrong with you, we got you.

1610
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
If this will help.

1611
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Any, if this will help.

1612
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
This will help.

1613
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
So it's just going to depend on what you mean by help.

1614
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Hey, look, we just, you know, we just,

1615
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
You don't need to say anything else.

1616
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
You just said it.

1617
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You say, hey, look, any element that you have.

1618
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Any problem you got.

1619
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Joaquil fuel, you're good.

1620
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
That's it.

1621
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
That's end of advertisement.

1622
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Every end of talking.

1623
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
We're good.

1624
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Any element.

1625
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
We're good.

1626
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Let me, I'm so, I mean, because some of these elements, we simply don't have you.

1627
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Seems like if you don't need extra, just an example.

1628
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
If you don't need extra point protein in the form of a dessert.

1629
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Some people, they don't need that.

1630
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Who doesn't need that?

1631
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Well, a lot of people don't need it, but of course we'll.

1632
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Of course we'll want that.

1633
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I mean, as far as protein goes,

1634
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
How can it get in it?

1635
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Well, then again, steak, seems same.

1636
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Steak is not in the form of a dessert.

1637
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
But sort of the same desire.

1638
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Yeah.

1639
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Anyway, all right, well, let me start at the beginning.

1640
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Okay, join more for it.

1641
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
That's for your joints.

1642
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yes.

1643
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
If and when, or let's just say, if they start to filter.

1644
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Are you going to narrow down the, you started, you're going to narrow down.

1645
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Are you attracting your statement that an 88 went?

1646
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
This is going to be cure by Choco fuel.

1647
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
No.

1648
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Well, technically, I didn't make that statement.

1649
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
So, I said this will help.

1650
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Oh, I don't know if it seems like.

1651
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Okay.

1652
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I miss radio.

1653
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Here's the thing.

1654
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I totally cheated on that statement because look, if you break your arm,

1655
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and I give you a leg massage, that'll help.

1656
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
It won't help your arm specifically, but, you know, legs are loose and good to go.

1657
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
So there will be benefits.

1658
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And even for truly any ailment.

1659
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So you're actually speaking, factually.

1660
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
In one way or another.

1661
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Yeah.

1662
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I think that's right.

1663
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So anyway, don't worry for our super-crui oil.

1664
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And antioxidants in there.

1665
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
By the way, it's called Zanthium.

1666
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It's called, it's called ailment.

1667
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Crusher.

1668
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
What?

1669
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Also, that supplement discipline.

1670
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
If you want some supplemental discipline, bone,

1671
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
got you disciplined, supplement.

1672
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
In cans, powder form, bone, whatever you like.

1673
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Did you say Criola?

1674
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I did super-crui.

1675
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Super.

1676
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Yeah.

1677
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Because really when it boils down to it,

1678
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
not being on super-crui oil and not being on joint warfare,

1679
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
is not a good idea.

1680
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
No.

1681
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You talk about the four something of light, right?

1682
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Yeah.

1683
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Those are the lightest things.

1684
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Yeah.

1685
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
But you can't suppose of light.

1686
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You gotta keep it light, Paul.

1687
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You have to.

1688
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
In my past, fresh after listening to this, I think so.

1689
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
That's what the super-crui oil, that's what the joint warfare,

1690
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
that's the discipline too.

1691
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
By the way, so it's all part of the whole circle of...

1692
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I must say, I drink the powdered form of discipline,

1693
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
go like basically all day long.

1694
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Basically we're talking about all day long.

1695
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000
You want to, you got some, you want to prevent some ailments.

1696
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Yeah.

1697
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Even ailment prevention is what we're talking about.

1698
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Vitamin D3.

1699
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Get some of that.

1700
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Get some cold war.

1701
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And you can deny these threatening enemy beasts ailments.

1702
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Oh yeah.

1703
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Better out there.

1704
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Just get rid of them before they even show up.

1705
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Oh yeah, immune systems.

1706
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
This is it.

1707
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Like somebody walks up to your immune system.

1708
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Some, some enemy walks up to your immune system.

1709
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
They see the D3 and they see the cold war.

1710
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
There's sort of like, hey, that's not, they're not attacking.

1711
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Yep.

1712
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
They're right in that category of don't attack.

1713
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You're correct, yeah.

1714
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
The ancient Wucci said,

1715
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
if you see a body filled with D3.

1716
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And a cold war, do not attack.

1717
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
It's a losing battle.

1718
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Yes.

1719
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Got the RGD cans.

1720
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
You want to get some, you want to get some jockel pommur.

1721
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
You do want to get some jockel pommur.

1722
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
This stuff is ridiculously good.

1723
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
The, the, the stuff is good.

1724
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
It's good for you, which is crazy.

1725
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Yeah.

1726
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
It's crazy.

1727
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Did you see Brian little field,

1728
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
KB little video on that on the whole deal?

1729
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Yeah.

1730
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
What, what makes it different?

1731
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
And I thought it was going to be like,

1732
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
What the difference is in the spirit or something.

1733
01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
You know, something kind of esoteric.

1734
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
And you can't really, like, put your finger,

1735
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
but he ran it.

1736
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
He went down the line like all this stuff.

1737
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
You know, like, okay, proprietary about the,

1738
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
what the, what the, what the, what the, what the, what is it?

1739
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Yeah, he's talking about the, the turn proprietary blend,

1740
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
which is a way of.

1741
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Masking.

1742
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
What you actually have in there and the quantities

1743
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
that you have in there, which means that you can sell people things

1744
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
that for a lot more.

1745
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
But, even though you didn't put very much of them in there.

1746
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.76
them in there. Yeah, yeah, which is sketch. Yeah, it's interesting. And then when he goes down the line,

1747
01:50:29.76 --> 01:50:35.52
you know, of all the stuff that's in there, it's all transparent. Like, you know, all the ingredients are like on there and stuff.

1748
01:50:35.52 --> 01:50:40.80
And you kind of, man, this is like, this, that does, that is different than like an energy.

1749
01:50:40.80 --> 01:50:46.000
All true. You know, which man, I'm, I like the energy drink. What about man when you, when you

1750
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.20
read this, you're like, bro, how can I even drink an energy drink now? You won't. But here's the thing.

1751
01:50:51.20 --> 01:50:57.36
We're making something else. We're making a ginger rail. Do you like ginger?

1752
01:50:57.36 --> 01:51:01.60
Yeah, so do. Okay. Well, there's going to be caffeine free ginger rail coming.

1753
01:51:02.88 --> 01:51:05.60
Well, I don't think we have a name for you. We're kind of tracking all that.

1754
01:51:07.60 --> 01:51:13.68
I was unaware that King Drillhead caffeine? Well, no, this one won't. It can or cannot. I mean,

1755
01:51:13.68 --> 01:51:17.52
you can have caffeine free coffee. You can have caffeine free tea. So we're making ginger

1756
01:51:17.52 --> 01:51:20.96
rail without caffeine. The reason is the, this is what I was going to say this. The reason I said that is because

1757
01:51:21.92 --> 01:51:28.48
I told, I told be little. I was like, listen, this stuff tastes freaking delicious. And I want to drink it all day.

1758
01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:35.52
Oh, yeah. And I don't want to OD on caffeine. There's 95 milligrams of caffeine in every can of go. So,

1759
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:42.16
you know, you have a can of go. Maybe have to a day. The maximum you're supposed to do recommended is like

1760
01:51:42.16 --> 01:51:49.36
400 milligrams of caffeine a day. That's going to turn me into a psychopath. Yeah, you know, I don't need that.

1761
01:51:49.76 --> 01:51:56.16
But here's the problem. Love the taste. So, well, it's a little discipline task because you got to

1762
01:51:56.16 --> 01:52:02.24
draw the line. But also the cool thing is when you're, when it's your company,

1763
01:52:02.24 --> 01:52:08.000
you know what, I want something without caffeine. Yeah. And so we're going to make that. I already

1764
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.92
had, I told I just probably about the six or seventh iteration of and we're still keeping in all the

1765
01:52:13.92 --> 01:52:18.40
positive stuff, all the good, the tropics, all the healthy things that are in there. It's all still

1766
01:52:18.40 --> 01:52:23.04
going to be in there. It's just not going to have caffeine. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. I'm misinterpreted it like as

1767
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:29.68
if to say normal ginger rail has caffeine. Yeah. But no, you're right. Like there's caffeine in the

1768
01:52:29.68 --> 01:52:34.48
jockel pombur or whatever. There's a little element of caffeine in there or a legitimate element.

1769
01:52:34.48 --> 01:52:40.000
Um, but this is not going to have to do that way. I can drink this stuff all day long. Get the

1770
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.48
other benefits for the product. One of those benefits being taste. Yeah.

1771
01:52:47.52 --> 01:52:52.80
Because I know someone that when they go out for dinner, they get Coca-Cola's. Yes, sir. Which are

1772
01:52:52.80 --> 01:52:59.12
not. No, sir, they're not. You know, hey, it's the freedom part. Yeah. And last, yeah, we're going to taste

1773
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:06.000
uh, like I mentioned before, a mulk and warrior kid milk by the way. So protein in the form of a dessert tastes good.

1774
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:13.92
No, tastes great. No, these were great. That offense. But I can do it. And you can get some jockel

1775
01:53:13.92 --> 01:53:19.20
white tea in the cans in the rub. 8,000 pound dead left. Do you know what's his no big deal? I

1776
01:53:19.20 --> 01:53:22.64
know that doesn't sound like we don't get to guarantee one or something. And you can get all these things

1777
01:53:23.20 --> 01:53:28.24
at origin main.com. You can get them at the vitamin shop as well in your local neighborhood.

1778
01:53:28.24 --> 01:53:33.92
There you go. Also, at origin main is, you just to stop when we start due to, when we're in

1779
01:53:33.92 --> 01:53:39.60
due to, we want to get a new key. We want to get a key or a rash cart to whatever. Or do you mean

1780
01:53:39.60 --> 01:53:44.64
come, they got that too. All made in America. Also since you can't, unfortunately, just wear a key

1781
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:50.48
whatever you go. Unfortunately. I mean, you can technically, but it's not recommended. Yeah.

1782
01:53:50.48 --> 01:53:58.56
Yeah. You can also get other things there like jeans, t-shirts, boots, yes boots. You can get

1783
01:53:58.56 --> 01:54:04.48
boots and all everything that we just talked about, everything without compromise made in America,

1784
01:54:04.48 --> 01:54:09.12
American hands up there getting after it. So I'm kind of thinking of the boots, right?

1785
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:15.76
And some other stuff like that. But the boots will just say the boots. So you know how woo,

1786
01:54:15.76 --> 01:54:22.000
z, no, woo, chee. Yeah, which is talking about like, hey, you spent a lot of time making that thing.

1787
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.08
Beautiful. But not function. I'm still trying to figure out the use for it, right? But these boots are

1788
01:54:28.08 --> 01:54:35.52
kind of like whoever made them. And them was kind of doing both. Same same. Like when they had the

1789
01:54:35.52 --> 01:54:41.04
goal for boots, they were like going functional with beauty, like handed hand almost kind of thing.

1790
01:54:41.04 --> 01:54:49.20
As far as works of art goes, down one's like, I'm not that much in fashion, like you were,

1791
01:54:49.20 --> 01:54:59.84
but it seems like that'd be like some top tier artistic. There's a good balance between

1792
01:55:00.88 --> 01:55:07.84
fashion and function between myself and a guy by the name of Pete Roberts. Let's face it.

1793
01:55:07.84 --> 01:55:16.48
Pretty. Well, let's face it on in a, in a vacuum environment with just Pete Roberts in there.

1794
01:55:16.48 --> 01:55:22.48
You all you have to do is look at rash guards from origin, right? You can look at those and you can see

1795
01:55:22.48 --> 01:55:28.96
where it's going to end up. When you inject a little jacco in there, all of a sudden things start,

1796
01:55:28.96 --> 01:55:33.92
you know, we start going a little bit more towards the form. Yeah. I can go a little bit more towards

1797
01:55:33.92 --> 01:55:39.84
the form thing. Pete can get wild. Hey man. Bro, I got you know, likes the way things look more

1798
01:55:39.84 --> 01:55:48.64
than me. Yes, or more than me. Quite a bit more than me. Yes, sir. But what's cool is you get that

1799
01:55:48.64 --> 01:55:54.000
balance like the jeans, man. Let's face it. There's some things about the jeans that are a little

1800
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.16
bit, they're functional like the pockets are slanted in the back right? It's easier to get. It's like

1801
01:55:58.16 --> 01:56:05.68
these little things. They're legit and it just so happens. Let's face it. They look super little.

1802
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:12.08
Bro, I went to Oregon just got back as you know and on the plane, this is saying a lot. No,

1803
01:56:12.08 --> 01:56:16.72
I'm not trying to like look dope because the paparazzi is going to be at the airport waiting

1804
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:21.76
for me when I ride. That's not my situation. You know, so I wear what's going to work in the airport

1805
01:56:21.76 --> 01:56:28.72
scenario environment, origin jeans all day to end from by the way. So you if the paparazzi was

1806
01:56:28.72 --> 01:56:33.68
waiting for you you'd wear something different. No. My concern with just lie elsewhere seems

1807
01:56:33.68 --> 01:56:40.24
same. I might even wear, I might even wear like you know those gold or diamond rimmed sunglasses.

1808
01:56:40.24 --> 01:56:44.48
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm just saying it's a different

1809
01:56:44.48 --> 01:56:52.56
pursuit is what I'm saying nonetheless those are the facts. Also, Jocco is a store called Jocco store.

1810
01:56:52.56 --> 01:56:57.28
This is where you can get other stuff if you want to represent on this path. This is a path

1811
01:56:57.28 --> 01:57:03.76
that we're all on the path of the game. Whatever you want to call it the way, the way, the woo,

1812
01:57:04.64 --> 01:57:12.40
the woo, right? Woo, right is way. Again, I tried to find out if Woozi meant anything and the

1813
01:57:12.40 --> 01:57:18.40
I couldn't find that a meant anything that I could comprehend other than room and I know that

1814
01:57:18.40 --> 01:57:23.92
this book is not called room. Yeah, but I think I'd woo if I'm not mistaken is the way.

1815
01:57:25.20 --> 01:57:31.20
Cool. I think I could be wrong. But I think woo by itself is Marshall as in Marshall,

1816
01:57:31.20 --> 01:57:38.80
art as in Wu Tang clan. Oh, okay. It's clear to me now. The last

1817
01:57:38.80 --> 01:57:42.56
chocolate store is called Jocco store. Like I said, and if you want shirts that say discipline

1818
01:57:42.56 --> 01:57:47.84
equals freedom, definitely. I'm going to YouTube comment that says echo in quotes like your

1819
01:57:47.84 --> 01:57:56.56
middle name nonetheless. Charles. Yes, I have seen that. Okay. Hey, man, I can I deny it. You know,

1820
01:57:56.56 --> 01:58:01.12
I guess I could technically, but you know, it would be less accurate than maybe if I didn't

1821
01:58:01.12 --> 01:58:05.76
deny it. We'll say that. Okay. Well, last like I said, back to discipline, you could treat them shirts

1822
01:58:05.76 --> 01:58:12.56
and hoodies and rash guards and hats. Some women stuff on there anyway if you want to represent

1823
01:58:12.56 --> 01:58:18.16
with merch as it were. I don't like to say the word merch that much, but if you like a pair

1824
01:58:18.16 --> 01:58:25.12
you want to represent a soccer store dot com. Subscribe to this podcast if you want to

1825
01:58:27.20 --> 01:58:29.60
echo seems to think that's a big concern in the morning.

1826
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:38.08
It's far as being concerned. So hey, not only is there this podcast, we also have the the

1827
01:58:38.08 --> 01:58:44.64
name, the podcast form we known as the thread, which is now known as the Jocco unraveling podcast.

1828
01:58:45.52 --> 01:58:52.88
That's we actually recorded a couple more with Darrell yesterday. It'll be back. It'll be live.

1829
01:58:53.68 --> 01:58:56.08
We'll put them, we're going to put them on this feed and then eventually we'll move

1830
01:58:56.08 --> 01:59:02.08
off to another feed so we don't confuse people. Grounded podcasts, we haven't done one of those in a

1831
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:07.76
while. That's probably negligent. Same with Warrior Kid podcast, but they are there. We will work on more.

1832
01:59:08.88 --> 01:59:14.16
Also speaking of Warrior Kids, we got that. We got that Warrior Kids. So I wish Oak for that

1833
01:59:14.16 --> 01:59:20.16
stock com or you can get it on the Jocco store. And this is made by a Warrior Kid who's putting his

1834
01:59:20.16 --> 01:59:27.84
effort in life to create something so that people in the world can stay clean.

1835
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:40.64
We have a YouTube channel where echo Charles makes videos. This will be on there. This whole scenario

1836
01:59:40.64 --> 01:59:45.28
will be on there. You can see what I look like. You can see what echo looks like.

1837
01:59:45.28 --> 01:59:53.20
I think echo then also makes these videos where in a three minute video, by the way, he'll put

1838
01:59:53.20 --> 02:00:00.96
900 explosions. But in a three hour video, he'll put none. That caught him in then. People are starting to wonder.

1839
02:00:03.44 --> 02:00:07.76
I think that certain things. Why don't you do this? Why don't you start with, like today,

1840
02:00:07.76 --> 02:00:13.68
you've talked about 14 different 80s movies. Why don't you put a little clip in there or put a little

1841
02:00:13.68 --> 02:00:19.76
something make a terminator robot or something, right? Just put it in there. People will go,

1842
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:26.88
ah, cool. I don't think they will. Because I think explosions terminator robots, etc,

1843
02:00:27.76 --> 02:00:33.68
are do have levels of appropriateness given. Give in. Thank you, Evan. Give in from

1844
02:00:34.40 --> 02:00:39.52
no limit to the appropriateness of explosions and for freaking. Give in what kind of video it is.

1845
02:00:39.52 --> 02:00:46.24
So, you know, we're gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna air on the side of a broken you at least try to put one

1846
02:00:46.24 --> 02:00:54.56
effect into a three hour podcast video. You know what the jury's still not on that one. Whether that's a good decision.

1847
02:00:54.56 --> 02:00:59.60
But we're gonna, I'm gonna keep checking in and you know, maybe maybe not. But, you know,

1848
02:00:59.60 --> 02:01:03.28
either way we're gonna, we're gonna move forward. Nonetheless, yes, YouTube channel. It is there.

1849
02:01:03.28 --> 02:01:08.000
A lot of people will a lot of us. We'll play the podcast straight up. Just play it on our TV or

1850
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.40
smart TV. You know, that's a thing now. And, you know, let's just play it. It's kind of like

1851
02:01:12.40 --> 02:01:16.08
boom, the conversation going around, going on in the room with you. You seem to say,

1852
02:01:16.64 --> 02:01:21.68
it does create that environment. It's what I'm saying. The last tune into that one on the YouTube.

1853
02:01:21.68 --> 02:01:26.48
That's the way to do it. Boom. Other stuff on the some excerpts on there too. If you don't necessarily

1854
02:01:26.48 --> 02:01:32.32
want to listen to the whole thing, all at once or whatever, you know, could you act this a little

1855
02:01:32.32 --> 02:01:37.36
or whatever. But no, some people will just catch the like the YouTube excerpts and be like,

1856
02:01:37.36 --> 02:01:41.76
oh, shoot, let me just let this one play. It's a good topic. Spirit, but it's just the one topics.

1857
02:01:41.76 --> 02:01:47.68
I'm saying that's good too. Very beneficial. Um, yeah, boom. There you go. Also psychological warfare.

1858
02:01:47.68 --> 02:01:51.76
If you don't know what that is, it's an album with tracks, jocco tracks, jocco telling you,

1859
02:01:51.76 --> 02:01:57.04
helping you. Really helping you. What, you don't want help. You don't need help. That's what you're saying.

1860
02:01:57.04 --> 02:02:00.56
No, that's not what you're saying. Sometimes we don't need a little bit of help. Psychological

1861
02:02:00.56 --> 02:02:05.44
warfare will help you through those moments of weakness, big weakness, small weakness, whatever.

1862
02:02:05.44 --> 02:02:13.68
You will get help through it. 100%. 100%. I just saw you riff. I like your band. Good job.

1863
02:02:13.68 --> 02:02:20.64
You didn't repeat this, you know, you stepped off your, your standard. Okay. I don't want,

1864
02:02:20.64 --> 02:02:24.72
I can't say script because it's not a script because you're not reading it. It's just the same

1865
02:02:24.72 --> 02:02:30.40
thing that you, you know, when I had a band you from saying that. Why would go? Right. Cool.

1866

Yeah. Also got flipside canvas.com. Dakota Myers company and he makes visual representations to

1885
02:04:25.12 --> 02:04:28.72
go to extremownership.com. But details look. It's probably going to be a social

1886
02:04:28.72 --> 02:04:32.24
distance situation, which means we're going to have less tickets to sell, which means it's going

1887
02:04:32.24 --> 02:04:39.92
to sell out faster. So extremownership.com. If you want to come EF Overwatch, if you are a

1888
02:04:39.92 --> 02:04:45.28
military individual that is moving into the civilian sector, or if you're a civilian company that

1889
02:04:45.28 --> 02:04:50.48
needs people that understand the principles we talk about here, go to eF Overwatch.com, fill out

1890
02:04:50.48 --> 02:04:55.84
the appropriate information, and we will move you in the right direction, both of you. America's

1891
02:04:55.84 --> 02:05:05.36
mighty warriors.org. This is Mark Lee's mom, momily, and she is out on a daily basis, making it

1892
02:05:05.36 --> 02:05:11.44
her mission to help service members, their families, the gold star families around the world. So

1893
02:05:11.44 --> 02:05:18.000
if you want to get involved or you just want to donate, go to americasmightywariers.org. And if you

1894
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:27.76
want some more of my inept interpretations or you would like to hear more of Eko's prolonged

1895
02:05:27.76 --> 02:05:36.64
proclamations, then you can find us on the inner webs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook,

1896
02:05:36.64 --> 02:05:41.36
that goes at Eko Charles and I am at Jockel Willingkin to all the folks out there in uniform, actually

1897
02:05:41.36 --> 02:05:47.84
enacting and living, these military principles to keep us safe and free. Thank you to all of you

1898
02:05:47.84 --> 02:05:52.96
and to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and

1899
02:05:52.96 --> 02:05:59.60
correctional officers and board of patrol and secret service. Thanks to all of you for holding

1900
02:05:59.60 --> 02:06:09.92
the line for us here on the home front. Now, everyone else out there. Listen,

1901
02:06:09.92 --> 02:06:18.48
who she said, that maybe we should try to shake the world with awesomeness. But like he also said,

1902
02:06:18.48 --> 02:06:28.64
stay balanced. Don't run with that idea. Stay on the high road. Don't dwell in magnificence and power.

1903
02:06:31.20 --> 02:06:37.60
That's your ego. Keep that thing in check. Instead follow the way how things should be done. Do things

1904
02:06:37.60 --> 02:06:50.08
with righteousness. Do things with propriety. That means you hold the standard. That means you

1905
02:06:50.08 --> 02:06:55.68
conform. It actually means you conform to doing what is right. Be benevolent. Take care of people.

1906
02:06:55.68 --> 02:07:06.000
And if you do those things and you do them humbly, well, then you can get out there

1907
02:07:07.52 --> 02:07:18.40
and shake the world with awesomeness, not for yourself. But for others. And that is leadership.

1908
02:07:18.40 --> 02:07:26.24
And until next time, this is echo. Benjaco. Out.
