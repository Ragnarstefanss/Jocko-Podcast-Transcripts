I didn't want to get my clothes dirty from him I wanted to look sharp he went down as far as the operating table but didn't want to lie down a nurse using broken chinese told him we're using ether it won't hurt so lie down she gave me a rise smile when she said that she had been working there for a long time and when I happened to meet her again much later and asked her about it she didn't remember she was handling so many vivis sections it was routine people who repeat evil acts do not remember them there is no sense of wrongdoing war means this also war is not just shooting in order for Japan to win all the chinese were made prisoners women's bellies were cut open homes were burned if you couldn't do this then you weren't a loyal soldier of the emperor even if one despises an act one must bear it from there a person becomes accustomed to it we all received practiced it was normal to smile at this the crimes committed during our aggressive wars are forgotten gone from memory at the time they were considered right so the surgery began the man was given ether and dissected his appendix was so small that it was like looking for a burling worm I had to cut and search repeatedly the blood flow was stopped nerves were cut bones were cut with a saw and a tracheotomy was performed blood and air escape from his body the blood came foaming up practice time was two hours the man died and his body was thrown into a hole and buried that was my first crime after that it was easy eventually I dissected 14 chinese I also saw vivis sections once I saw about 40 doctors gathered there was a man bound and squatting the guard asked the doctors are you ready and the prisoner was laid out without anesthetic two cuts were made down as belly the victim made a few gas the dissection was a botch and he died soon I saw four people dissected that way it is said that there are that there were 20 million victims of the war in China but only 10 to 20% of these were killed in gunfire exchange most non-resisting old people women and children were captured and slaughtered prisoners of war could not be taken to the front or allowed to escape so they were killed in the manner of the rape of NAN King those who were a part of it do not come forward to tell the people how it was why because the Japanese have forgotten all about it everybody's forgotten they did things and got medals and they don't think they did anything worse than kicking a dog they weren't bothered because they never considered a dreadful thing to take a scalpel and cut open a living person and this will be the last piece of testimony that I read and this was a soldier that was attached to unit 731 named O'Hara Takiyoshi and he said I joined the cavalry from my home in 1939 in April of that year I was stationed in northeast China then in March 1942 I was transferred to unit 731 I did not know anything about that unit my first duty was taken care of domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, horses and cows I assisted in researching the diseases that affect these animals I saw tests in which Maruta were tied to crosses in a large circle as planes flew over and dropped bacteriological bombs in the area surrounded by the crosses their legs were chained and their bodies tied tightly we observed the tests from a distance of about 200 meters I had the job of cleaning up and disinfecting after the experiments and gathering to bring lying around I want people who come to this exhibition to tell their children and grandchildren that there is nothing more stupid and fearful then more nothing more stupid and fearful then more and I think that's a good quote to end this except for it is wrong it is wrong because as stupid and as fearful and as reprehensible as war is there is something worse than war and that is allowing this kind of evil to exist as bad as war is and war is awful war is hell and I have said that over and over again as have many others but there are worse things than war things like unit 731 things like the Nazi concentration camps things like the rape of Nand King there are things that are worse than war and there are times when war is not only justified but it is a moral obligation and I do not say that lightly but when evil and when darkness and when malevolent and demonic spirits rise to power they must be stopped in the responsibility for that lies within all of us every day to do our best to do our best to move the world away from the darkness and the demons that linger inside men's minds and move the world toward the light and toward what is good okay we drop the atomic bombs this just kind of makes that a close deal in my mind you know you got people that are trying to they got enough enough biological weapon treated in fact half the world so and again jumping forward in this book get the book so that you can get the whole story but there's a massive infestigation that takes place to find out what's going on there's little leeks they they catch wind of little bit of it but not a lot of it and at one point there interrogating ishi and here's ishi did not any involvement our work was to protect soldiers he said did anyone else concerned themselves with biological warfare against crop plants I do not know replied ishi his interrogator made no effort to pursue the matter Thompson of veterinarian by training turned the questions of biological warfare against animals we did not do any experiments on large large animals said ishi we used small animals as test animals besides we had no veterinarians what field tests were made with the plague organism he asked due to the danger of it there were no field experiments with that organism there were great many field mice in menturia and it would have been dangerous to conduct field experiments with plague because the field mice would very easily carry the organism since started an epidemic we conducted the experiments with plague in the laboratory said ishi what kind of experiments Thompson acquired we put rats and cages inside the room and sprayed the whole room with plague bacteria this was to determine how the rats became infected whether through the eyes knows mouth or through the skin what did you find out the test results were not too favorable we usually got 10% infection by which way that was the total said ishi misunderstanding the question what route was most effective Thompson repeated through the nose said ishi also through an open wound so they're interrogating he's been pretty he's lying he's covering up but there's there's a twist that we're going to see unfold here and I'll explain it a little bit so it makes sense as it comes forth the twist in this story is that the cold war was about to start the cold war was now starting and America these experiments that had taken place and knowledge had been gained through this through these evil experiments well and I'll catch myself doing and it'll take along as I don't know like brother it's not even necessary and in fact and some people they will bring up this point which is a good point where I put stuff commonly right for okay warpath or take warpath for example I put the walls crumbling in Jacoen Dean rolling and when they when they clash like the walls come chattering down it's all these special effects which is like cool when you look at but all the special effects the sound effects and like all this stuff is like is it kind of getting in the way of the message because the message is like you're saying something specific you know but I'll give a brief synopsis of it one of the problems is if you charge someone with war crimes and you put them on trial well you've got to say with their own what the war crimes are that they committed and if you say that the war crimes were committed were these experiments with chemical and biological weapons then people are going to know what the results of the experiments were and that means the knowledge is going to be out there and the knowledge could fall into the hands of people that we were now looking to be facing in another war which ended up being the cold war luckily not a full war so that's how this that's how this story continues to unfold back to the book there's no question that is an individual and many of the associates were guilty of serious war crimes as lieutenant general ishi was unissue undoubtably possessed sufficient high military rank to be classified as a class a war criminal he was the top of the tree in his own field his actions as the head of unit 731 qualified him as a criminal on many accounts not only was biological warfare considered extra legal by most countries but issue is also guilty of outrageous conventional war crimes he had carried out calculated human experimentations on prisoners of war a conventional war crime that had long been prescribed in the manials of military law of every major power he'd carried out similar research against innocent civilians clearly a crime against humanity. and that's how you can put someone like yeeshie that goes through all that and still remains loyal even after defeat still remains loyal to the deposed emperor and here's an army doctor named uosah Ken this is not easy for me to speak about but it is something I must confess what I did was wrong it is also true that it was forced on me by the government but that does not reduce the size of my crime it is something that happened a long time ago but those who are not taught about the war are ill-educated the Japanese army went to plunder and steel materials and to kill Japan wanted iron, coal and provisions and the army drove into the mountains to prosecute the war at the time the Japanese used derogatory terms for the chinese like chinamen and chink and looked at them with contempt when I was a child we were told to despise the chinese despise the Koreans it's all right to conquer them we have become elite and should join with the Americans in British and conquer Asia I hated war and killing but around middle school and into college I began to think that such ideas were unavoidable people were driven into a life which human qualities in which human qualities were lost the soldiers outlet for frustrations was the brothel of the comfort women any means was resorted to in order to raise one's rank and keep up the authority of the country and in the army hospital we practiced vivis section living persons are good for the scalpel practice so people were brought in one day soon after I started at the assignment the hospital had told us today we will have surgery practice I was startled it was an order there was no getting out of it normally we dissected people who had died of such diseases as typhoid fever, dysentery and tuberculosis now we were being taken to the section room for a different type of exercise soldiers came along as observers everything started with a signal from the hospital head one chinese had big thighs and walk slowly and calmly he laid down and had no sign of fear no stress on his face he was composed someone else used him for surgery practice I went over and pushed the other one onto the operating table I had no feeling of apology or of doing anything bad the farmer was resigned to his fate and I quote interesting choice of music for this that's it now I also will say that I don't 100% trust myself like I think to myself well echo really liked Christmas music so he put it in there so that's fine if that maybe some other people will like it too and that's I'm not here to like dictate what people like and don't like I'm just here to tell you what I like and don't like Kobe the city went to his second wife had come mitzuo who wants to provide the the unit's animal house outlived his younger brother shiro but was unable to work after the war and lived on money gained by selling his country property mitzuo and tecao and their eldest brother torael who had been killed in the ruso japanese war during japan's major period are buried in the ishi family cemetery at cameo on august 17th 1958 13 years after the end of the war in the back room of a stone mason shop near tomah cemetery stokeo ishi made his first and apparently only post war appearance before assembled at junior members of his former unit he reminisced about the early days of unit 731 in a speech reportedly still rich in xenophobia and elitism he she described how his unit was to have been the salvation of japan a country then encircled by the west scientifically impoverished yet spiritually rich he apologized for their suffering since the end of the war but urged his audience to remain proud of the memory of unit 731 and here's a little part of his what he said it was in order that we could have precious human material that the unit 731 was set for the saving of the nation national circumstances were not permitting unfortunately we did not achieve our aims so even after all that even after all that even looking back after 13 years after the end of the war he's looking back and and still has the same mindset and that meant how could he's hard to understand and I want to shed a little bit of light on that mentality and do that through some personal accounts of what happened at unit 731 but again those sentences don't include ishi or the other main players at units 731 because they got kind of protected not even kind of they got protected by America and exchange for their information sort of in response to everything that was going on there on December 27th 1941 the following story appeared in the New York Times date land Tokyo no knowledge MacArthur says general darkless MacArthur's headquarters said today there were no known cases in which Japanese used American prisoners in jernmore for experiments the headquarters added that the Japanese had done some experiments with animals although there was no evidence they had ever used human beings as far as it is known here no American's held prisoner by the Japanese that mook didn't ever accuse their captors of having used them as guinea pigs in biological warfare tests so that's all not true that's all not true back to the book to this day Russia has allowed itself to bask in feelings of moral superiority over America and not without some justification in respect of the way it brought its unit 731 criminals to justice so just that's the way it flushed out now this you might think that's a little disturbing this is equally disturbing this just horrible back to the book after the war most of the scientists of unit 731 prospered much is explained by the clear complicity on the part of the United States authorities in the war crimes of unit 731 the detachments civilian researchers and other associated scientists were quite free to return to academia and it goes through this lit this multiple page list of of guys that went on to work at the research institute for natural resources chief so it continues and open back to the book and it opened admission about human experimentation allegations about the the use of biological warfare even hints about the connection between unit 731 and a member of the Japanese imperial family were all contained in the files of legal sections case 330 by the middle of 1947 how did this come about and why was nothing be done being done about the files contents so this is getting shut down that's what's happening now here's the sort of the more official opinion back to the book on balance the subcommittee felt it was desirable to avoid a war crimes prosecution and here's what they said since it is believed that the USSR possesses only a small portion of this technical information and since any war crimes trial would completely reveal such data to all nations it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in interests of defense and the security of the United States it is believed it is believed also that war crimes prosecution of eshi and his associates would serve to stop the flow of much additional information of a technical and scientific nature it is felt that the use of this information as a basis for war crimes evidence would be a grave detriment to Japanese cooperation with the United States occupation forces in Japan so there you hear the decisions getting made and that's the way it went and in the end going back to the book no member of unit 731 was called before any British or American military tribunal to account for war crimes none of them well actually not by any British or Americans because the Russians they still went after and they and when they went after them and they got some of them they made America look bad they had a big trial and here's the the state council the state council's name was smear off but it was just this weird stiffness that sort of just like I couldn't straighten it out right away when I wake up you know I can't like you know I kind of got to work it out and it slowly just started to just stiffen up a little more and here's the thing I was way less active on it too where because when I do like pushups and stuff where I'm using my elbow a lot it would be kind of stiff that night you know than the next thing you do stuff but if they're doing good work scientifically and for you know medical schools and stuff like this is obviously they're teaching people they're probably you know making breakthroughs and you know discoveries in the field and stuff that's gonna help people in general you know now here's the other way I'm gonna frame it for you is from the eyes of that mother who's in that gas chamber who's watching that switch get turned and she knows it's gonna kill her and her child and there's no there's no redemption zero check good job trying to lighten up the mood over here you're all you
