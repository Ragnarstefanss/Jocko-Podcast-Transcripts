[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 103 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:11] Whilst lying at Windchester, young as I was in the profession, I was picked out amongst
[00:00:16] others to perform a piece of duty that, for many years afterwards, remain deeply
[00:00:22] impressed upon my mind and gave me the first impression of the stern duties of a soldier's
[00:00:27] life.
[00:00:28] A private of the 70th Regiment had deserted from that corps, and afterwards, enlisted
[00:00:36] into several other regiments.
[00:00:38] Indeed, I was told at the time that 16 different times he had received the bounty and
[00:00:45] then stolen off.
[00:00:48] Being however, caught at last he was brought to trial at Portsmouth and sentenced by
[00:00:53] General Court Marshall to be shot.
[00:00:59] As the execution would be a good hint to us, youngins, there were four lads picked
[00:01:04] out of our corps to assist in this piece of duty, myself being one of the number chosen.
[00:01:12] Besides these men, four soldiers from three other regiments were ordered on the firing
[00:01:18] party, making 16 at all.
[00:01:22] The place of execution was Portsdown Hill and the different regiments assembled must have
[00:01:29] composed a force of about 15,000 men having been assembled from the Isle of White, from
[00:01:36] Chai Sester, Gauceport and other places.
[00:01:41] The site was very imposing and appeared to make a deep impression on all there.
[00:01:49] As for myself, I felt that I would have given a good round sum, had I possessed it to have
[00:01:55] been in any other situation rather than the one, rather than the one which I now found
[00:02:01] myself.
[00:02:03] And when I looked into the faces of my companions, I saw by the pallor and exited, depicted
[00:02:10] in each countenance, the reflection of my own feelings.
[00:02:17] And all was ready, we removed to the front and the culprit was brought out.
[00:02:24] He made a short speech to the parade, acknowledging the justice of his sentence and that drinking
[00:02:30] an evil company had brought the punishment upon him.
[00:02:37] He behaved himself firmly and well and did not seem to flinch at all.
[00:02:43] After being blindfolded, he was desired to kneel down behind a coffin which was placed
[00:02:50] on the ground and the drum major of the depot giving us an expressive glance.
[00:02:57] We immediately commenced to loading.
[00:03:02] This was done in the deepest silence and the next moment we were primed in ready.
[00:03:10] It was then a dreadful pause for a few moments and the drum major again looking towards
[00:03:15] us, gave us the signal agreed upon before, a flourish of his cane.
[00:03:22] And we leveled and fired.
[00:03:28] We had been previously strictly enjoying to be steady and take good aim and the poor fellow
[00:03:34] pierced by several balls, fell heavily upon his back.
[00:03:39] As he lay with his arms, pinion to his sides, I observed that his hands waved for a few
[00:03:45] moments, like the fins on a fish, when in the agonies of death.
[00:03:52] The drum major also observed the movement and making another signal for of our party immediately
[00:03:59] stepped up to the post-rate body and placing the muzzles of their pieces to the head, fired
[00:04:05] and put him out of his misery.
[00:04:10] The different regiments then fell back by companies and the word being given to March
[00:04:16] past in slow time.
[00:04:18] When each company came in line with the body, the word was given to Mark time and then
[00:04:24] eyes left in order that we all might observe the terrible example.
[00:04:32] We then moved onwards and marched from the ground to our different quarters.
[00:04:42] And that is from a book called Recollections of Rifleman Harris, who was an enlisted soldier
[00:04:52] for the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars and that was his welcome to the Army.
[00:04:59] He had been in for about three weeks of service when he had to stand and execute a fellow
[00:05:07] soldier for basically being drunk and disorderly, not doing what he was supposed to do.
[00:05:18] Essentially, he was being executed for being a human being.
[00:05:25] That was the introduction to military service for Rifleman Harris.
[00:05:29] Rifleman Harris's full name was Benjamin Randall Harris.
[00:05:33] He enlisted in 1803.
[00:05:37] He fought all over Europe in the peninsula war, which posed bourbon Spain, the kingdom of Portugal
[00:05:46] and the British Empire against Napoleon's French Empire and boat-apartists Spain.
[00:05:53] And also the Duchy of Warsaw.
[00:05:57] This is a war where they have daggers and swords and bayonets and mounted cavalry charges.
[00:06:09] They have cannons and they used a lot of muzzle loading rifles, which a skilled rifleman
[00:06:19] could load and fire about three times per minute, accurate out to about 200 yards.
[00:06:27] Very different from the weapons that we have now, which can fire three rounds in a second.
[00:06:34] And our very accurate out to 800 yards, a thousand yards and some sniper weapons way further
[00:06:40] than that.
[00:06:44] But even though these weapons are different from the weapons we see in modern warfare,
[00:06:51] as always in the end, it is men.
[00:06:57] It is human beings on the battlefield, bleeding, sweating, starving, suffering, killing,
[00:07:08] and being killed.
[00:07:13] This is a little bit more about riflemen, Harris, going back to the book.
[00:07:24] My father was a shepherd and I was a sheep boy from my earliest youth.
[00:07:28] Indeed as soon as almost I could run, I began helping my father to look after the sheep
[00:07:32] on the downs of blanford in Dorsetcher, where I was born.
[00:07:38] Whilst I continued to tend the flocks and herds under my charge, and occasionally in the
[00:07:42] long winter nights, I learned the art of making shoes.
[00:07:47] I grew a hearty little chap and was one fine day in the year of 1802, drawn as a soldier
[00:07:54] for the army of reserve.
[00:07:57] Thus without troubling myself much about the change, which was about to take place in
[00:08:02] the quiet of my routine days, I was drafted into the 66th regiment of foot.
[00:08:09] It did goodbye to my shepherd companions and was obliged to leave my father without
[00:08:14] an assistant to collect his flocks.
[00:08:17] Just as he was beginning more than ever to require one.
[00:08:21] Nay indeed, I may say to want tending and looking after himself, for old age and infirmary,
[00:08:30] we're coming on him.
[00:08:32] His hair was growing white as the sleet of our downs and his countenance becoming as
[00:08:37] furrowed as the plowed fields around.
[00:08:41] However, as I had no choice in the matter, it was quite as well that I did not grieve over
[00:08:46] my fate.
[00:08:48] My father tried hard to buy me off and would have persuaded the sergeant of the 66th
[00:08:53] that I was of no use as a soldier, from having maimed my right hand by breaking the four
[00:08:58] finger when I was a child.
[00:09:01] The sergeant, however, said I was just the sort of little chap he wanted.
[00:09:06] And off he went, carrying me amongst a batch of recruits he had collected away with him.
[00:09:15] She purter.
[00:09:18] Dad's getting old, army comes and gets you.
[00:09:21] That's the way it works.
[00:09:23] England, 1802.
[00:09:31] Now he travels around a little bit and eventually ends up in Dublin.
[00:09:38] Here we go back to the book, whilst in Dublin, I one day saw a core of the 95th rifles and
[00:09:44] fell so in love with their smart, dashing and devil-may care appearance that nothing would
[00:09:49] serve me until I was a rifleman myself.
[00:09:53] So on arriving at Castle One Day and falling in with the recruiting party of that regiment
[00:09:57] I volunteered into the second battalion.
[00:10:00] This recruiting party were all Irishmen.
[00:10:03] And I had been sent over from England to collect amongst others men from the Irish militia
[00:10:09] and were just about to return to England.
[00:10:12] I think they were as reckless and devil-may care, a set of men I'd ever been beheld either
[00:10:17] before or since.
[00:10:19] So these riflemen, I would say from what I read about them, they're almost like a special
[00:10:28] ops unit and one big difference is they're wearing red jackets like the Brits were
[00:10:34] wear at this time.
[00:10:35] They wore green.
[00:10:36] So they were a little bit different and they had more accurate rifles and they would fight.
[00:10:43] They would do what they called skirmishing which is fundamentally cover-move.
[00:10:47] They'd shoot and they'd maneuver and they'd act like little special operations troops out
[00:10:54] there.
[00:10:55] Of course it's interesting to me when I hear this guy talking about the first time he saw
[00:11:03] someone that looked a little bit like a special operations troop.
[00:11:06] He said, well he actually says, I fell in love with it.
[00:11:10] That's very much how I felt as I was growing up the more I saw the special ops.
[00:11:18] He didn't even need to be special ops for me.
[00:11:20] It was just someone in the military.
[00:11:22] Then he was already in the military, so now he's looking for the next thing.
[00:11:25] What's the next thing going to be?
[00:11:27] And here he ends up as a rifleman.
[00:11:32] So he's now a rifleman.
[00:11:34] He joins, he moves over to their regiment and here we go back to the book.
[00:11:38] The next day we marched for Ashford and Kent where I joined the 95th rifles and about six
[00:11:43] months after my joining four companies of the second battalion were ordered on the expedition
[00:11:47] to Denmark.
[00:11:48] We embarked at deal and sailing for hostile shores landed on a little place called I think
[00:11:55] Scarlet Island.
[00:11:57] The expedition consisted of about 30,000 men.
[00:12:01] And at the moment of our getting on shore, the whole force set up one simultaneous and
[00:12:06] tremendous cheer, a sound I cannot describe, it seemed so inspiring.
[00:12:12] This indeed was the first time of my hearing the style in which our men give tongue when
[00:12:17] they get near the enemy.
[00:12:19] The laughter words my ears became pretty well accustomed to such sounds.
[00:12:25] As soon as we got on shore, the rifles were pushed forward and we said the rifles he's
[00:12:30] talking about his guys.
[00:12:32] The rifles were pushed forward as the advance in chain order through some thick woods
[00:12:37] of fur.
[00:12:39] And when we had cleared these woods and approached Copenhagen centuries were posted on the
[00:12:43] roads and openings leading toward the town in order to intercept all commerce and prevent
[00:12:47] all supplies.
[00:12:49] Such posts were occupied for about three days and nights whilst the town was being fired
[00:12:53] upon by our shipping.
[00:12:55] I rather think this was the first time of the Kongrive rockets being brought into play
[00:13:01] and they rushed through the air in the dark.
[00:13:03] They appeared so like so many fiery serpents creating I should think terrible dismay among
[00:13:09] the besieged the Kongrive rockets.
[00:13:12] They basically looked like giant bottle rockets in a way.
[00:13:16] And they got at this time they were getting their range out to 1500 2000 meters.
[00:13:22] So it was a pretty crazy weapon.
[00:13:26] And I can tell you rockets in this day and age have become fairly accurate but in those
[00:13:31] days probably about as accurate as a bottle rocket is my guess.
[00:13:37] Back to the book as the main army came up we advanced and got as near under the walls
[00:13:42] of the place as we could without being endangered by the fire from our own shipping.
[00:13:45] So what's happening right there is cover move.
[00:13:47] The shipping is bombarding and these guys are advancing as close as they can where they
[00:13:51] are not going to get killed by their own fire from the ships.
[00:13:56] We now received orders ourselves to commence firing and the rattling of the guns I
[00:14:00] shall not easily forget.
[00:14:03] I felt so much exhilarated that I could hardly keep back and was checked by the commander
[00:14:08] of the company who called me by my name to keep my place.
[00:14:12] Throughout this time my front rank man, a tall fellow named Jack Johnson, showed a disposition
[00:14:19] as though the firing had a effect on him the reverse of what it had on many others of the
[00:14:25] company.
[00:14:26] For he seemed inclined to hang back and once or twice turned around in my face.
[00:14:32] I was a rear rank man and porting my peace in the excitement of the moment.
[00:14:37] I score that if he did not keep his ground I would shoot him dead on the spot.
[00:14:42] So that he found it he would go on so that he found it would be quite as dangerous for him
[00:14:47] to return as to go on.
[00:14:51] I feel sorry to record the warmth of courage of this man but I do so with the less pain
[00:14:56] it gives me the opportunity of saying that during my many years of arduous service it
[00:15:01] is the only instance I remember of a British soldier endeavoring to hold back when his comrades
[00:15:07] were moving forward.
[00:15:10] Indeed Johnson was never held again an estimation among the rifle corps.
[00:15:15] For the story got wind that I had threatened to shoot him for cowardice in the field and
[00:15:19] Lieutenant Cox mentioned to the Colonel that he'd overheard my doing so and such was the
[00:15:24] contempt the man was held in by the rifles that he was soon afterwards removed.
[00:15:34] There you go.
[00:15:36] First time under fire it's interesting how rifle man Harris first time under fire he wants
[00:15:43] to get after him.
[00:15:44] He is ready to charge and only one guy out of the whole crew is looking like he's going
[00:15:49] to hold back and they talk about reputation here and that's definitely something that
[00:15:55] is when you get to this heel teams as you're a new guy someone tells you they'll say
[00:16:00] your reputation is everything and it's totally true and it's the same in any military organization
[00:16:07] what your reputation is because in the military you think ranks all important right but
[00:16:13] the reality is there's something that completely trumps rank and that's reputation.
[00:16:18] And if you're I mean I always talk about the fact that relationships are more important
[00:16:23] than chain of command but you're not going to have a good relationship with people if you
[00:16:27] don't have a good reputation it's not happening.
[00:16:30] So make sense.
[00:16:31] Same thing back in 1803.
[00:16:36] Back to the book.
[00:16:37] Whilst in Denmark we led a tolerably active life the rifles being continually on the alert ordered
[00:16:43] heither today and counter-mandered the next occasionally also we had some pleasant adventures
[00:16:51] among the blue eyed Danish lasses for the rifles were always terrible fellows in that
[00:16:58] way.
[00:17:02] I think that doesn't need too much explanation.
[00:17:08] They I'll say this as I always say I have to fast forward through this book I'm not
[00:17:13] reading the entire book even though the entire book is awesome in this point this point
[00:17:18] here they're embarking for Portugal we have another another campaign to go on back to
[00:17:27] the book I wish I could picture the splendid sight of the shipping in the downs at the time
[00:17:32] we embarked with about 20,000 men those were times which are so which the soldiers of our
[00:17:37] own more peaceful days have little conception of.
[00:17:41] So this book was written before World War I and really this was the last big war is the
[00:17:50] wars that he went through the Napoleonic wars so he's kind of he's kind of saying you
[00:17:54] don't even know if this is like anymore you don't know what it's like.
[00:17:58] You don't know if the the the the soldiers of our own more peaceful days have little conception
[00:18:03] of what it's like to embark 20,000 troops to get ready to go get some.
[00:18:10] To the book we sailed majestically out of the cove of cork for hostile shore where we
[00:18:15] would safely arrived and disembarked at Mondego Bay.
[00:18:20] The rifles were first out of the vessels for we were indeed always in front of the
[00:18:26] advance and always in the rear in retreat like the Kentish men of old we claim the post of
[00:18:32] honor in the field I try to figure out what that.
[00:18:36] The Kentish men Kentish obviously a place and and the as far as the best I could figure
[00:18:42] out was that the people in Kent stood up hardcore against the Norman invasion and I think
[00:18:48] that's what that reference is to.
[00:18:51] I'm sure someone will correct me and I hope somebody does.
[00:18:55] Back to the book being immediately pushed forward up the country and advance the main body
[00:18:59] many of us in this hot climate very soon began to find out the misery of the frightful
[00:19:04] load we were condemned to march and fight under with a burning son above our heads and
[00:19:09] our feet sinking every step into the hot sand.
[00:19:13] The weight of the weight I myself toiled under was tremendous and I often wonder at the
[00:19:18] strength I possessed at this period that which enabled me to endure it.
[00:19:23] For indeed I'm convinced that many of our infantry sank and died under the weight of
[00:19:27] their nap sacks alone.
[00:19:29] For my own part being a handicraft, a handicraft I marched under the weight sufficient to
[00:19:35] impede the free motions of a donkey.
[00:19:39] For besides my well-filled kit there was a great coat rolled on its top my blanket and
[00:19:44] camp kettle my haversack stuffed full of leather for repairing the men's shoes together
[00:19:49] with a hammer and other tools.
[00:19:52] Ship biscuit and beef for three days.
[00:19:55] I also carried my canteen filled with water my hatchet and rifle and 80 rounds of ball
[00:20:00] cartridge in my pouch.
[00:20:03] This last except the beef and biscuit being the best thing I owned and which I always
[00:20:09] gave the enemy the benefit of when the opportunity offered.
[00:20:15] It's interesting he knew how to work on shoes and so he carries stuff to repair shoes
[00:20:21] in the field.
[00:20:22] Think about that that's just a lost art isn't it?
[00:20:25] Think about where you are in the field when you have to march 15 miles a day and you
[00:20:30] have no shoes if there's someone that can fix your shoes.
[00:20:34] That's a godsend.
[00:20:37] Back to the book the next day we again advanced and being in a state of the utmost anxiety
[00:20:41] to come up along the French neither the heat of the burning sun, long miles or heavy
[00:20:47] nap sacks were able to diminish our arguer.
[00:20:50] Indeed I often look back with wonder at the light-hearted style, the jolety and the reckless
[00:20:56] indifference with which men who were so destined and short time to fall hurried onwards
[00:21:02] toward the field of strife, seemingly without a thought of anything but the sheer love
[00:21:07] of meeting the foe and the excitement of battle.
[00:21:14] You wrote this book 20 something years after this happened after this experience.
[00:21:21] I want to say he wrote it in 1938 maybe is when it came out and you can see that so my
[00:21:35] point in saying that is that looking back he knows because he's going to go through hell.
[00:21:42] He's going to go through hardcore combat but even knowing how horrible combat is he still
[00:21:48] looks back and is amazed at how they were ready to go.
[00:21:54] Going back to the book the 29th Regiment received so terrible a fire that I saw the right
[00:22:00] wing almost annihilated and the Colonel I think his name was Lennox Lace sprawling amongst
[00:22:04] the rest.
[00:22:06] We had caught ourselves in it pretty hamptomly for there was no cover for us and we were
[00:22:13] rather too near.
[00:22:14] The living skirmishers were laying beside heaps of their own dead but still we had our
[00:22:20] own till the battalion regiments come up.
[00:22:24] Fire and retire is a very good sound but the rifles were not overfond of such notes.
[00:22:31] We never performed that maneuver except when it was made pretty plain to us that it was
[00:22:35] quite necessary.
[00:22:37] The 29th however had got their fairing hair at this time and the shock of that fire seemed
[00:22:43] to stagger the whole line and make them recoil.
[00:22:46] At the moment a little confusion appeared in the ranks I thought.
[00:22:50] Lord Hill was near at hand and saw it and I observed him come galloping up.
[00:22:55] He put himself at the head of the regimen and restored them to order in a moment there's
[00:22:59] some leadership just full on leadership and action.
[00:23:02] So there's also fire and retire what that means is cover move.
[00:23:06] So you have some people shooting and some people falling back that's how they retreat
[00:23:10] and they use that whenever they have to retreat you'll hear that.
[00:23:13] I don't know if I did this made this clear enough but it's a bugle.
[00:23:17] It's a bugle signal so the bugle would play some certain number of notes or some pattern
[00:23:23] of notes and everyone would know that means fire and retire.
[00:23:27] Now we get that broad that broad plan out to everyone at once which is instead of advancing
[00:23:36] which is what we were doing now we're going to retreat and as soon as you get everyone
[00:23:41] that information now little elements can start to make it happen that's decentralized
[00:23:44] command but you have to have good communications in order for that to work and what you
[00:23:48] need to communicate is the broad plan and that's what they get done with a nice little
[00:23:52] bugle signal back to the book pouring a regular sharp fire upon the enemy he gulred
[00:23:59] them in return and remaining with the 29th until he brought them to the charge quickly
[00:24:05] sent the foe in the right about.
[00:24:09] It seemed to me that few men could have conducted the business with more coolness and
[00:24:13] quietude of manner under such a storm of balls as he was exposed to.
[00:24:19] Indeed I have never forgotten him from that day.
[00:24:22] So it's important to also recognize that you have a group of men that are about to fall
[00:24:28] apart and there's confusion and one guy I talk about this all the time one guy steps up
[00:24:36] takes ownership of the situation leads and it changes the entire outcome of the battle.
[00:24:40] Think about that one person you got thousand men versus a thousand men one person makes
[00:24:45] the difference.
[00:24:46] So if you're in a leadership position think about that think about what you're doing.
[00:24:49] Are you leading?
[00:24:51] Are you stepping up?
[00:24:52] Are you galloping up on a horse and setting things right?
[00:24:55] Hmm.
[00:24:56] Collector, do you need to be doing it?
[00:24:59] Back to the book, at the time I was remarking these matters loading and firing as I lay.
[00:25:04] Another circumstance divided my attention for a while and made me forget even the
[00:25:08] gallant conduct of general hill.
[00:25:11] A man near me uttered a scream of agony and looking from the 29th who were on my right to
[00:25:16] the left once the screech had come.
[00:25:19] I saw one of our sergeants named Frazier sitting in a doubled up position and swaying
[00:25:24] backwards and forwards as though he had got a terrible pain in his bowels.
[00:25:30] He continued to make such complaint that I arose and went to him for he was rather a
[00:25:36] crony of mine.
[00:25:37] Oh, Harris said he as I took him in my arms.
[00:25:41] I shall die.
[00:25:42] I shall die.
[00:25:43] The agony is so great that I cannot bear it.
[00:25:46] It was indeed dreadful to look upon him.
[00:25:50] The froth came from his mouth and the perspiration poured from his face.
[00:25:55] Think heaven.
[00:25:57] He was soon out of pain and laying him down I returned to my place.
[00:26:04] Poor fellow, he suffered more for a short time that he was dying than any man I think
[00:26:08] I ever saw in the same circumstances.
[00:26:12] I had the courtesy to return and look at him after the battle.
[00:26:16] The musket ball I found had taken him sideways and gone through both groins.
[00:26:24] Within about a half an hour after this, I left sergeant Frazier and indeed for the time
[00:26:31] had as completely forgotten him as if he had died a hundred years back.
[00:26:37] The sight of so much bloodshed around will not suffer the mind to dwell long in any particular
[00:26:42] casualty.
[00:26:44] Even though it happened to one's dearest friends.
[00:26:49] There was no time either to think for all was action with us rifles just at this moment.
[00:26:55] And the barrel of my piece was so hot from continual firing that I could hardly bear to
[00:26:59] touch it.
[00:27:01] It was obliged to grasp the stock beneath the iron as I continued to blaze away.
[00:27:13] Doesn't even have time to think about it.
[00:27:18] James Panton was another crony of mine, a gallant fellow.
[00:27:22] He had pushed himself in front of me and was checked by one of our officers, rat for
[00:27:27] his rashness.
[00:27:28] He'd be back you, Panton.
[00:27:31] The lieutenant said to him more than once, but Panton was to be restrained.
[00:27:35] But Panton was not to be restrained by anything but a bullet went in action.
[00:27:41] This time he got one, which striking him in the thigh I suppose hit an artery for he died
[00:27:47] quickly.
[00:27:49] The Frenchman's balls were flying very wickedly at that moment and I crept up to Panton
[00:27:54] and took shelter by lying behind and making a rest for my rifle of his dead body.
[00:28:00] It strikes me that I revenge his death by the assistance of his carcass.
[00:28:06] At any rate I tried my best to hit his enemies hard.
[00:28:10] There were two small buildings to our front and the French having managed to get into
[00:28:14] them annoyed as much from that quarter.
[00:28:17] A small rise in the ground closed before these houses also favored them.
[00:28:23] And our men were being handled very severely in consequence.
[00:28:27] They became angry and wouldn't stand it any longer.
[00:28:31] One of the skirmishers jumping off, rushed forward, crying over boys over over.
[00:28:37] When he instantly went instantly, the whole line responded to the cry over over over
[00:28:43] they ran along the grass like wildfire, then dashed at the rise, fixing their sword
[00:28:48] bayonets as they ran.
[00:28:51] The French light bobs could not stand the sight but turned about and fled and getting
[00:28:57] possession of their ground we were soon inside the buildings.
[00:29:01] After the battle was over I stepped across the other house.
[00:29:04] I have mentioned in order to see what was going on there.
[00:29:08] For the one I remained in was now pretty well filled with the wounded, both French and
[00:29:12] English who had managed to get there for a little shelter.
[00:29:17] Two or three surgeons also had arrived at this house and were busy engaged in giving
[00:29:22] their assistance to the wounded.
[00:29:24] Now also here lying as thickly as in the building which I had left.
[00:29:28] But what struck me the most.
[00:29:31] But what struck me the most forcibly was that from the circumstance of some wine butts having
[00:29:36] been left in the apartment and having their engagement been perforated, having in the
[00:29:41] engagement been perforated by bullets and otherwise broken, the red wine had escaped most
[00:29:46] plentifully and ran down upon the earth and floor where the wounded were lying so that
[00:29:51] many of them were soaked in the wine with which their blood was minkled.
[00:30:01] I hate to even think about the medical care that these guys are getting and the medical
[00:30:10] care that we had in Iraq was unbelievable.
[00:30:16] Not only from the speed that you would get assistance but also the quality of care that
[00:30:23] you would get on in the field from our own medics and how quickly they would get you
[00:30:30] and then get you take care of and then get you evacuated to a full medical facility.
[00:30:36] And that actually changed during my time in the teams.
[00:30:40] For instance the biggest change.
[00:30:41] When I first got in the teams what we were taught was if someone got shot you immediately
[00:30:49] give them an IV meaning a bag of fluid because they're bleeding you got to replace that.
[00:30:55] And now they don't do that automatically because your body has its own mechanisms when
[00:31:03] it loses blood to stop the bleeding.
[00:31:05] It pulls back in the arteries and veins and it constricts them and it cloths the blood that's
[00:31:12] there and so when you give someone an IV the body thinks I don't need to do that so it
[00:31:17] opens up the arteries and opens up the veins it doesn't constrict anything it doesn't
[00:31:21] get cloths slower.
[00:31:23] So there's like one example and that's during my time so that's the last 25 years
[00:31:28] that that changed to stay in place.
[00:31:30] So now you go back you know a hundred and two hundred years it's totally different and
[00:31:37] they'll talk more about that.
[00:31:39] The basic the basic plan was if you get shot in a limb you're losing the limb that's
[00:31:45] basically what's going on just amputations.
[00:31:51] And nowadays they do an incredible job of saving limbs if they can be saved they save
[00:31:58] them I mean they do an incredible job.
[00:32:01] All right back to the book it was on the 15th of August when we first came up with
[00:32:06] the French and their skirmishers immediately commenced operations by raining a shower
[00:32:12] of balls upon us as we advanced which we returned without delay and I haven't said
[00:32:18] this yet but the reason they're saying balls and said around is because these guys are
[00:32:21] shooting balls with you round balls of lead and at this point there was some rifling
[00:32:26] head started to come about but what they basically just consider everything to be a ball
[00:32:32] of lead and that's why they're not accurate that's why they're only accurate out to 200
[00:32:36] meters because they're not rifled like we have the tight rifling spinning bullets
[00:32:41] today.
[00:32:43] Back to the book the first man that was hit was Lieutenant Bunbury.
[00:32:48] He fell pierced through the head with a musket ball and died almost immediately.
[00:32:54] I thought I never heard such a tremendous noise as the firing made on the occasion and
[00:32:58] the men on both sides of me I would could occasionally observe we're falling fast.
[00:33:06] I do not pretend to give a description of this or any other battle I have been present
[00:33:11] at.
[00:33:12] All I can do is tell the things which happened immediately around me and that I think is as
[00:33:17] much as a private soldier can be expected to do.
[00:33:22] Soon afterwards the firing commenced and we had to take we had advanced pretty close
[00:33:26] upon the enemy.
[00:33:28] Taking advantage of whatever cover I could find I threw myself behind a small bank where
[00:33:32] I lay so secure that although the Frenchman's bullets fell pretty thickly around I was
[00:33:38] enabled to knock several over without being dislodged.
[00:33:42] In fact I fired away every round I had in my pouch while slaying in this spot.
[00:33:49] At length after a sharp contest we forced them to give ground and following them up drove
[00:33:55] them from their position in the heights and hung up their skirts until they made another
[00:34:00] stand and then the game began again.
[00:34:04] The rifles indeed fought well this day and we lost many men.
[00:34:10] They seemed in high spirits and delighted at having driven the enemy before them.
[00:34:16] The most impressive coach was by my side loading and firing very industriously about this
[00:34:21] period of the day.
[00:34:24] Firsting with heat and action he lifted his canteen to his mouth, here's to you old boy.
[00:34:29] He said as he took a poll at its contents.
[00:34:32] As he did so a bullet went through the canteen and perforated his brain killing him in
[00:34:38] a moment.
[00:34:39] Another man fell close to him almost immediately struck by a ball in the thigh.
[00:34:47] I saw a man named Simon struck full in the face by a round shot and he came to the ground
[00:34:54] a headless trunk.
[00:35:00] When the role was called after the battle the females who missed their husbands came along
[00:35:05] the front of the line to inquire of the survivors whether they knew anything about them.
[00:35:13] The wives could travel with the soldiers and again it just seems crazy to me right now but
[00:35:19] that's the way they did it.
[00:35:22] Not all of them but if they made that decision I guess as a family to stick together they
[00:35:27] would get right on board the boats and they'd march in the book they didn't want
[00:35:35] to carry the weight but they'd march alongside and go from place to place and when the
[00:35:40] battles about to take place they'd hang back and then you have the situation once the
[00:35:44] battles over that I'm talking about right now.
[00:35:47] Amongst other names I heard that of Coach Ann called in a female voice without being
[00:35:52] replied to.
[00:35:54] The name struck me and I observed the poor woman who had called it as she said stopping
[00:35:58] sobbing before us and apparently afraid to make further inquiries about her husband.
[00:36:04] Oh man had answered to his name or had any given account to give of his fate.
[00:36:10] I myself had observed him fall as related before while drinking from his canteen but as
[00:36:16] I looked at the poor sobbing creature before me I felt unable to tell her of his death.
[00:36:23] That length capped in leech observed her and called out to the company does any man know
[00:36:28] what has happened to Coach Ann.
[00:36:30] If so let him speak out at once upon this order I immediately related what I had seen and
[00:36:37] told the man of his death.
[00:36:39] After a while this coat misses Coach Ann appeared anxious to seek the spot where husband
[00:36:44] fell and in the hope of still finding him alive asked me to accompany her over the field.
[00:36:50] She trusted notwithstanding what I had told her to find him yet alive.
[00:36:56] Do you think you could find it said captain leech upon being referred to?
[00:37:01] I told him I was sure I could as I had remarked many objects whilst looking for cover
[00:37:07] during the skirmishing.
[00:37:08] Go then said the captain and show the poor woman the spot as she seemed so desireless
[00:37:13] of finding the body.
[00:37:16] I accordingly took my way over the ground we had fought upon she following and sobbing
[00:37:20] after me quickly reaching the spot where her husband's body lay pointed out to her.
[00:37:27] She now discovered soon all her hopes were in vain.
[00:37:32] She embraced a stiffened corpse and after rising and contemplating his disfigured face
[00:37:38] for some minutes with hands clasped and tears streaming down her cheeks she took a prayer
[00:37:44] book from her pocket and kneeling down repeated the service for the dead over the body.
[00:37:53] Poor woman.
[00:37:55] I pity her much but there was no remedy.
[00:38:05] I told her I was a little bit more nervous than I thought.
[00:38:17] The French came down upon us as a column and the rifleman immediately commenced
[00:38:23] to sharp fire upon them from whatever cover they could get a shelter behind whilst
[00:38:27] our cannon played upon them from our rear.
[00:38:31] I saw regular lanes torn through their ranks as they advanced which were immediately
[00:38:36] closed up again as they marched steadily on.
[00:38:40] Whenever we saw round shot, thus go through the mass we raised a shout of delight.
[00:38:46] That's a savage image right there ranks of men and there's cannon balls that are cutting
[00:38:52] lines through cutting lanes through them.
[00:38:56] You probably talking 20, 30 people killed each one and the ranks just closing around them.
[00:39:02] That's what these guys are seeing as this advanced takes place.
[00:39:07] They're continue through that battle.
[00:39:09] They get into a position for another battle.
[00:39:12] Going back to the book as I looked about me while standing and ranked and just thought
[00:39:17] and just before the commencement of the battle, I thought it the most imposing sight
[00:39:22] the world could produce.
[00:39:24] Our lines glittering with bright arms, the stern features of the men as they stood with
[00:39:29] their eyes fixed on alterably upon the enemy, the proud colors of England floating over
[00:39:35] the heads of the different battalions and the dark cannon on the rising ground and all
[00:39:41] in readiness to commence the awful work of death with a noise that would defen the whole
[00:39:47] multitude.
[00:39:49] Although the sight had a singular and terrible effect upon the feelings of a youth who,
[00:39:55] a few short months before, had been a solitary shepherd upon the downs of door-sature
[00:40:01] and had never contemplated any other sort of life than the peaceful occupation of watching
[00:40:07] the innocent sheep as they fed upon the grassy turf.
[00:40:13] Talk about a dichotomy.
[00:40:15] Yeah. No fought in his mind other than watching sheep eat grass.
[00:40:22] I would think that that would be kind of a good little escape, you know, from time to time
[00:40:28] to notice those types of things.
[00:40:31] Yes, I think you're right and I think that happens and there's a movie called the Finn Redline
[00:40:38] and that's portrayed very well.
[00:40:41] And all this chaos, he'll take cover and he'll be face to face with a flower or he'll
[00:40:46] notice a bird or a bug and that's definitely something that people notice.
[00:40:51] I mean, I noticed there's this sunset no matter where you are in the world and actually
[00:40:56] there's sunset in the desert, it's a very beautiful thing and same with the sunrise.
[00:41:01] And so those are little things that you notice even though you might not be in the mindset
[00:41:05] to notice them, you still notice them.
[00:41:11] Back to the book, the battle commencing immediately, we were all soon hard at work.
[00:41:16] The rifles as usual were pretty busy in this battle.
[00:41:19] The French and Great Numbers came steadily down upon us and we peltered away upon them
[00:41:24] like a shower of lead and hail.
[00:41:27] Under any cover we could find and lay, firing one moment jumping up and running for at
[00:41:32] the next.
[00:41:34] And when we could see before us, we observed the cannonballs making a lane through the
[00:41:38] enemy's columns as they advanced as they were, hosying and shouting like madmen.
[00:41:48] The battle soon became general, the smoke thickened around and often I was obliged to stop
[00:41:54] firing and dash it aside from my face and try and vain to get a sight of what was going
[00:41:59] on whilst groans and shouts and an oys of cannon and muscatory appeared almost to shake
[00:42:05] the very ground.
[00:42:07] It seemed hell upon or if I thought.
[00:42:10] A man named John Low stood before me at this moment and he turned round during a pause
[00:42:16] in our exertions, then he addressed me, Harris, you humbug?
[00:42:20] He said, you've got plenty of money about you, I know, for you don't always staying
[00:42:24] about and picking up what you can find on the field.
[00:42:27] But I think this will be your last field, Dale, boy.
[00:42:30] A good many of us will catch it, I suspect today.
[00:42:34] The right low I said, I've got nine guinea's in my pack and if I am shot today and you
[00:42:40] escape yourself, it's quite at your service in the meantime, however, if you see any symptoms
[00:42:47] of my wishing to flinch in this business, I hope you will shoot me with your own hand.
[00:42:55] Low.
[00:42:56] So let's think about that.
[00:42:58] That's pretty awesome.
[00:43:00] Well, the attitude of they're basically talking smack to each other.
[00:43:04] Classic.
[00:43:05] Hey, I don't think you're going to make it.
[00:43:06] I know you got a lot of money on you and if you don't make it, what do you say?
[00:43:10] Is that mine?
[00:43:11] Yes, if I die, come and get it.
[00:43:13] I got nine guinea's in my pack.
[00:43:14] They're all yours.
[00:43:16] And then this is classic.
[00:43:17] By the way, if you see me acting cowardly in any way, you better shoot me.
[00:43:23] Yeah, it's legit.
[00:43:26] Low as well as myself survived this battle.
[00:43:28] And after it was over, whilst we sat down with our comrades and rested amongst other matters,
[00:43:34] talked over, low told them of our conversation during the heat of the day, and the money
[00:43:38] I'd collected, and the rifles from that time to time had a great respect for me.
[00:43:43] It is indeed singular how a man loses or gains cast with his comrades from the behavior
[00:43:50] and how closely he is observed on the battlefield.
[00:43:53] Again, talking about reputation once again.
[00:43:57] The officers too are commented upon and closely observed.
[00:44:03] Everyone's watching the officers.
[00:44:05] The men are very proud of those who are brave in the field and kind in consider it
[00:44:10] to the soldiers and under them.
[00:44:14] An act of kindness done by an officer has often during battle been the cause of his life
[00:44:20] being saved.
[00:44:22] Got a little relationship going.
[00:44:25] Nay, whatever folks may say upon the matter, I know from experience that in our army,
[00:44:31] the men like best be officer by gentleman, men whose education is rendered them more kind
[00:44:38] in manners than your course officer sprung from obscure origin and whose style is brutal
[00:44:44] and overbearing.
[00:44:46] So as I was reading through that, at first I kind of got a little bit taken a back
[00:44:52] and said, what are you trying to say if you have a men of college or that's what you need,
[00:44:56] you need to be from this good upbringing.
[00:44:59] But that might be what he's saying at that time.
[00:45:02] But the important part is it's how you treat people.
[00:45:05] Doesn't matter what background you came from.
[00:45:08] He says, men whose education is rendered them more kind in manners and rather than someone
[00:45:13] that's from an obscure origin.
[00:45:15] What I'm telling you is it doesn't matter where you're from and he would agree with this
[00:45:19] now if he was here to talk with me.
[00:45:21] Of course.
[00:45:22] But it's not.
[00:45:24] He's talking about the the men like to work for officers that aren't brutal and overbearing.
[00:45:30] No one likes that.
[00:45:32] And you don't perform well.
[00:45:35] You want to build the relationship with your troops, the kindness done by an officer
[00:45:38] is often during the battle, been the cause of his life being saved.
[00:45:42] That means guys are trying to win.
[00:45:49] Back to the book and let me bear testimony to the courage and endurance of that army
[00:45:55] under trials and hardships, such as few armies in any age I should think endured.
[00:46:02] I've seen officers and men hobbling forward with tears in their eyes from the misery
[00:46:07] of long miles, empty stomachs and ragged backs without even shoes or stockings on their
[00:46:13] bleeding feet.
[00:46:15] And it was not a little thing that would bring a tear into the eyes of a riflemen of the
[00:46:19] peninsula wars.
[00:46:22] Yuts, who had not long been removed from their parents home and care, officers and men
[00:46:29] have borne hardships and privations such as in our more peaceful days, we have little conception
[00:46:36] of.
[00:46:38] And yet these men, faint and weary with toil, would brighten up in a moment when the
[00:46:45] war granted amongst us that the enemy were at hand.
[00:46:51] Once again he's ragging on you have really been to war lately, peaceful days and brutal
[00:47:02] privations that these guys go through and yet they're still ready to step up.
[00:47:06] Back to the book it was just at the close of the battle.
[00:47:09] The dreadful turmoil and noise of the engagement had hardly subsided and I began to look
[00:47:13] at the faces of the men close around me to see who had escaped the dangers of the hour.
[00:47:19] I saw that the ranks of the riflemen looked very thin.
[00:47:22] It seemed to me that one half had gone down.
[00:47:27] We had four companies with a 95th and were commanded that day by major traverse.
[00:47:33] He was a man much liked by the men of the rifles and indeed deservedly beloved by all
[00:47:37] who knew him.
[00:47:39] He was a tight hand but a soldier likes that better than a slavinly officer.
[00:47:46] Pay attention to that one.
[00:47:49] Don't be a slavinly leader.
[00:47:53] The troops prefer the tight hand.
[00:47:55] Back to the book I had observed him more than once during this day spurring here and there
[00:47:59] keeping the men well up and apparently in the highest spirits.
[00:48:03] He could not have enjoyed himself more I am sure.
[00:48:07] If he had been at a horse race or following a good pack of hounds.
[00:48:11] The battle was just over.
[00:48:12] A flag of troops came over from the French.
[00:48:16] We threw ourselves down where we were standing when the fire ceased.
[00:48:20] A Frenchman lay close beside me.
[00:48:22] He was dying and called to me for water which I understood him to require more from his
[00:48:26] manner than his words.
[00:48:29] I need not say that I got up and gave it to him.
[00:48:33] Whilst I did so, down galloped the major in front, just in the same good spirits he'd
[00:48:38] been in all day, plugging along, avoiding with some little difficulty, the dead and dying
[00:48:44] which were strewn about.
[00:48:47] He was never a very good-looking man being hard-featured and thin, a hatchet faced man as we
[00:48:53] used to say.
[00:48:55] But he was a regular good and a real English soldier.
[00:48:59] And that's better than if he had been the handsomeest ladies man in the army.
[00:49:06] Legit.
[00:49:08] Totally legit.
[00:49:13] Back to the book, a French soldier was lying beside me at this time.
[00:49:16] He was badly wounded and hearing him moan as he lay after I had done looking at the cavalry.
[00:49:21] I turned my attention to him and getting up.
[00:49:24] Lifted his head and poured some water into his mouth.
[00:49:27] He was dying fast, but he thanked me in a foreign language, which although I did not exactly
[00:49:31] understand, I could easily make out by the lucky gave me.
[00:49:35] Mullins of the rifles, who stepped up whilst I supported his head, damned me for a fool
[00:49:42] for my pains.
[00:49:43] Better knock out his brains, Harris, he said, he's done us, mischief, enough.
[00:49:49] I'll be bound for it today.
[00:49:54] The rifleman Harris is still a pretty sympathetic dude.
[00:50:00] Back to the book, towards evening I posted upon a rising ground amongst a clump of tall
[00:50:04] trees.
[00:50:06] There seemed to have been a sharp skirmish here as three Frenchmen were lying dead amongst
[00:50:10] the long grass upon the spot where I was standing.
[00:50:12] As I threw my rifle to my shoulder and walked past them on my beat, I observed they had
[00:50:17] been plundered and their haversax having been torn off some of the contents were scattered
[00:50:22] about.
[00:50:25] War is a sad blunter of the feelings I have often thought since those days.
[00:50:31] The contemplation of three ghastly bodies in this lonely spot failed then in making the slightest
[00:50:38] impression upon me.
[00:50:40] The sight had become even in the short time I had been engaged in the trade, but two familiar.
[00:50:49] And now there another truce kind of happens and he's observing the scene in this church
[00:50:57] yard.
[00:50:58] The scene in this church yard was somewhat singular.
[00:51:01] Two long tables had been procured from some houses near and were placed end to end amongst
[00:51:05] the graves and upon them were laid the men whose limbs it was found necessary to amputate.
[00:51:12] Both French and English were constantly lifted on and off these tables.
[00:51:17] As soon as the operation was performed upon one lot they were carried off and in those
[00:51:22] waiting behind were hoisted up.
[00:51:25] The surgeons with their sleeves turned up and their hands and arms covered in blood looking
[00:51:30] like butchers in the shambles.
[00:51:34] I saw as I passed at least 20 legs lying on the ground, many of them being clothed in the
[00:51:40] long black gators then worn by the infantry line.
[00:51:44] The surgeons had plenty of work on hand that day and not having the time to take the
[00:51:49] clothes off the wounded.
[00:51:50] They merely ripped the seams and turned the cloth back, proceeding with the operation as fast
[00:51:55] as they could.
[00:51:58] Many of the wounded came straggling into this church yard and search of assistance by themselves.
[00:52:03] I saw one man faint with loss of blood staggering along and turned to a system.
[00:52:10] He was severely wounded in the head, his face being completely encrusted with blood which
[00:52:15] had flowing during the night now dried.
[00:52:19] One eyeball was knocked out of the socket and hung down upon his cheek.
[00:52:24] Another man I observed who had been brought in and propped up against a grave mound.
[00:52:30] He seemed very badly hurt.
[00:52:32] The men who had carried him into the church yard had placed his cap filled with the fragments
[00:52:37] of biscuit close beside his head and he lay and occasionally turned his mouth towards
[00:52:42] it, got a hold of a piece of biscuit and munched it.
[00:52:47] As I was about to leave the church yard, Dr. Ridgeway, one of the surgeons called me back
[00:52:51] to assist with holding a man he was endeavouring to operate upon.
[00:52:57] Come and help me with this man, he said, where I shall be all day cutting a ball out of his
[00:53:01] shoulder.
[00:53:04] The patient's name was Douder, an Irishman.
[00:53:07] He disliked the doctor's efforts and arrived and twisted so much during the operation
[00:53:12] that it was with difficulty Dr. Ridgeway could perform it.
[00:53:16] He found a necessary to cut very deep and Douder made a terrible outcry at every fresh
[00:53:21] incision.
[00:53:22] Oh, Dr. Deer, doctor, he said, it's murdering me you are.
[00:53:28] Blood and hounds, I shall die, I shall die for the love of the Lord, don't cut me all
[00:53:32] the pieces.
[00:53:36] Douder was not altogether wrong.
[00:53:39] For although he survived the operation, he died shortly thereafter from the effects of his wounds.
[00:53:46] Again, you just got surgeons mixing blood and not clean and not even cutting off clothes
[00:53:57] or sterilizing.
[00:53:58] I mean, the amount of people that must have lost from the infections after the fact
[00:54:02] is just crazy.
[00:54:09] Now they weren't fighting all the time.
[00:54:13] And at this point, they are quartered into house and Spain and again, Spain was divided
[00:54:17] at the time and there was friendly and enemy, Spain and so they are quartered in a house
[00:54:24] and there's a family there.
[00:54:26] Here we go to the book, the mistress of the house, seeing that I was the head man, occasionally
[00:54:30] came down and sat beside me as I worked, bringing her daughter, a very handsome, dark-eyed
[00:54:36] Spanish girl and as a matter of course, I fell in love.
[00:54:42] We soon became better acquainted and the mother one evening having sat and chattered to
[00:54:47] me serving me with wine and other good things on my rising to leave the shop made a signal
[00:54:52] for me to follow her.
[00:54:54] She had managed to pick up a little English and I knew a few words of the Spanish language
[00:54:58] so that we could pretty well comprehend each other's meeting.
[00:55:02] And after leading me into their sitting room, she brought in her handsome daughter and without
[00:55:07] more circumstances offered her to me for a wife.
[00:55:12] The offer was attempting one, but the conditions of the marriage made it impossible for me
[00:55:16] to comply since I was to change my religion and dessert my colors.
[00:55:21] The old-dame proposed to conceal me, effectively, when the army marched after which I was
[00:55:27] to live like a gentleman with the handsome Maria for a life.
[00:55:33] It was hard to refuse so tempting and offer with pretty Maria endeavering to back her mother's
[00:55:39] proposal.
[00:55:41] I, however, made them understand that nothing would tempt me to dessert and promising
[00:55:46] to try and get my discharge when I returned to England, I protested I would then return
[00:55:51] and marry Maria.
[00:55:54] Soon after this the army marched for Spain, the rifles paraded in the very street where
[00:56:01] the shop I had so long worked at was situated and I saw Maria at the window.
[00:56:08] As our bugle struck up, she waved her handkerchief.
[00:56:13] I returned the salute and in half an hour had forgotten all about her.
[00:56:20] So much for the soldiers love that I read that and I said, I have to read this.
[00:56:26] This is to every 18, 19, 20 and 21 year old service member out there that you made the
[00:56:33] girlier dreams and you think you're going to do some dumb stuff.
[00:56:38] Don't do the dumb stuff.
[00:56:41] Go back to your platoon and in a half an hour you'll forget about her because that's what
[00:56:47] happens.
[00:56:48] Such so much for a soldier's love.
[00:56:55] Back to the book, every man in the rifle seemed only anxious to get a wrap at the French
[00:56:58] again.
[00:57:01] On a non-weed toiled, I love to remember the appearance of that army as we moved along
[00:57:05] at this time.
[00:57:06] It was a glorious sight to see our colors spread in these fields.
[00:57:10] The men seemed invincible.
[00:57:11] Nothing I thought could have beaten them.
[00:57:19] He's talking about a guy named Cardo.
[00:57:23] He was found to be a most gallant officer when we were engaged with the enemy in the field.
[00:57:28] He was killed whilst fighting bravely in the Pyrenees and amongst other Jewry he wore, he had
[00:57:33] a ring on his finger worth 150 guineas.
[00:57:37] He lay dead on the field one of our rifle, rifleman named Orr, observed the sparkling
[00:57:43] gem and immediately resolved to make a prize of it.
[00:57:47] The ring however was so firmly fixed that Orr could not draw it from the finger and whipping
[00:57:51] out his knife cut the finger off at the joint.
[00:57:55] After the battle or offered the ring for sale amongst the officers and on inquiry the
[00:58:01] manner in which he obtained it transpired.
[00:58:05] Orr was in consequence, tried by court martial and sent us to receive 500 lashes which
[00:58:14] sentenced his carried into execution.
[00:58:16] There's some significant corpal punishment going on here with the lashes and that's
[00:58:23] one of the cases.
[00:58:24] I mean, you know when you're executing someone for being drunk and disorderly, you're
[00:58:29] going to get some pretty severe punishment for cutting the finger off of one of your officers
[00:58:33] so you can steal their ring.
[00:58:39] Back to the book it was during the heat of the day we were rather hotly pressed by the
[00:58:43] enemy after having advanced somewhat to near their force.
[00:58:46] Given take is all fair enough but we were getting more kicks than half-pence as the saying
[00:58:51] is and their balls stung us so sharply that the officers gave the word to fire and retire.
[00:58:58] Outless, many got a lead in messenger as they did so which saved them the unpleasant necessity
[00:59:04] of retracing their ground altogether.
[00:59:08] Jock Gillespie and myself wheeled about and obeyed the order.
[00:59:14] Just as we had done so I saw Gillespie limp along as though someone had bestowed a violent
[00:59:19] kick upon his person.
[00:59:22] However he didn't give up at first but continued to load and fire and make off with other
[00:59:27] scourmetures to we halted and made another stand.
[00:59:32] For we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly help.
[00:59:38] I'm going to read that again.
[00:59:42] We continued to load and fire and make off with other scourmetures to we halted and made
[00:59:48] another stand for we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly
[00:59:54] help and what that means is covered move.
[00:59:59] So if you are out on the battlefield and you get too far away from the other element where
[01:00:05] you can no longer support them you've made a big mistake.
[01:00:09] So that's why they have doctrinal terms that mean I am in supporting distance.
[01:00:17] I won't go further away from you than where I can't help you.
[01:00:21] All right now speaking of lashing is there's another situation here.
[01:00:32] There was sort of a ceremony where they were gathering and standing in the parade sort
[01:00:39] of in a town square and somebody basically threw I think like a brick.
[01:00:47] One of the soldiers from one of the windows that was watching the other regiment.
[01:00:51] So there's one regiment standing on the parade field, handing out a wars or something.
[01:00:54] The other regiment sitting up in the various rooms around looking down and at some point
[01:01:01] this someone hooks a brick down and it hits the kernel.
[01:01:08] So this guy, Listen, was the guy that they grab and they think it's this guy, Listen,
[01:01:15] back to the book.
[01:01:16] Listen was sentenced to receive 800 lashes. The whole brigade turned out on the occasion and
[01:01:21] I remember that the drummers of the night regiment were the inflictors of the lash.
[01:01:28] Listened, Listen received the whole sentence without a murmur.
[01:01:35] This is a him talking about.
[01:01:39] As he goes on to talk about how this strict discipline about it and how it kind of fits
[01:01:44] in with the English mentality back to the book.
[01:01:48] They are strange set the English and so determined and unconscribable that they will have
[01:01:54] their way if they can.
[01:01:55] Think about that.
[01:01:57] Your soldiers, it's a great quality to have right your determined and unconscribable.
[01:02:03] But what does that mean?
[01:02:04] I mean you're going to have your way if you can.
[01:02:05] If you let them, they're going to get after it.
[01:02:08] Maybe in a good way you don't expect.
[01:02:11] Indeed, back to the book it indeed, it requires one who has authority in his face as
[01:02:16] well as at his back to make them respect and obey him.
[01:02:21] They see too often in the instance of sergeant majors that command does not suit ignorant
[01:02:26] and course-minded men.
[01:02:29] And that tyranny is too much used even in the brief authority which they have.
[01:02:35] So again, he's going back to the fact that even though you have to have, he's talking
[01:02:37] about the dichotomy of leadership, even though you have to have discipline, you can't have
[01:02:41] tyranny.
[01:02:43] Back to the book, a soldier I'm convinced is driven often to in subordination by being worried
[01:02:49] by these little-minded men for the various trifles about which the gentleman never thinks
[01:02:57] of tormenting him.
[01:02:58] So the little-minded person that harps on these little trifling things, that's what actually
[01:03:06] creates in subordination, whereas the gentleman never thinks of tormenting him with these
[01:03:11] little things.
[01:03:14] Like these little things don't matter.
[01:03:17] Then he goes on to balance this dichotomy of leadership back to the book, the moment
[01:03:21] the severity of the discipline of our army is relaxed in my opinion, farewell to its efficiency.
[01:03:28] But for men to be tormented about trifles, as I've seen at many times, is often very
[01:03:35] injurious to the whole core.
[01:03:37] So this is the perfect talking about the balance of the dichotomy of leadership.
[01:03:42] If you're too altruist, your guys are going to rebel against you, and if you're not strict
[01:03:47] enough, or you don't impose enough discipline, they're going to not have any control.
[01:03:51] So you've got to balance these two.
[01:04:01] Going forward back to the book, war is a sad blunter of the feelings of men.
[01:04:05] He said that before, and he's saying it again.
[01:04:07] We felt eager to be added again.
[01:04:11] Nay, I am afraid we longed for blood as the cheer of our comrades sounded in our ears,
[01:04:17] and yet amidst all this, softer feelings occasionally filled the breasts of those gallant
[01:04:22] fellows, even whilst they were thirsting for the sight of the enemy.
[01:04:27] Some of the men near me suddenly recollected as they saw the snow lying thickly on our
[01:04:32] past path that this was Christmas Eve.
[01:04:36] The recollection soon spread amongst the men, and many talk to home and scenes upon
[01:04:41] that night in the other days of the old England shedding tears as they spoke of the
[01:04:45] relative's and friends never to be seen again by them.
[01:04:50] As night approached, we became less talkative.
[01:04:53] The increasing weiriness of our limbs kept our tongues quieter, and we were many of us half
[01:04:59] a sleep as we walked when suddenly a shout arose in the front that the French were upon
[01:05:05] us.
[01:05:07] So guys are missing home.
[01:05:09] It's Christmas Eve.
[01:05:11] Nice little dusting of snow on the ground.
[01:05:17] They have this skirmish with the French there, and now they're continuing the first
[01:05:22] march.
[01:05:23] If you remember the march that we talked about with Napoleon's troops going into Russia
[01:05:27] and back, these guys are under the same basic conditions of if you want to move the
[01:05:32] army, the army is going to walk.
[01:05:36] Back to the book, a sergeant of the night.
[01:05:37] So he's now on this also, not only they forced marching right now, they're starting to
[01:05:42] retreat.
[01:05:43] They're starting to take heavies, and they start a retreat.
[01:05:48] Back to the book, a sergeant of the 90 second highlanders just about this time fell dead with
[01:05:53] fatigue, and no one stopped as we passed off for a many assistance.
[01:05:58] Night came down upon us.
[01:06:00] So let's think about that.
[01:06:01] And this, I highlighted that one, but throughout this book he talks about people that
[01:06:05] is dying, and he says they died of fatigue.
[01:06:07] I even know what that means actually.
[01:06:10] Maybe they're dehydrated.
[01:06:11] I don't know.
[01:06:12] But if you think about these guys who are risking their lives for each other, how exhausted
[01:06:17] are they that when someone falls out during this first march, the forced march, they just
[01:06:20] leave them there.
[01:06:24] Back to the book, night came down upon us without our having tasted food or halted.
[01:06:30] I speak for myself and those around me, all and all night long we continued this dreadful
[01:06:35] march.
[01:06:36] Men began to look into each other's faces and ask the questions.
[01:06:39] Ask the question, are we ever to be halted again?
[01:06:42] Many of the weaker sort were now seen to stagger, make a few desperate efforts, and then
[01:06:48] fall, perhaps, to rise no more.
[01:06:52] Most of us had devoured all we cared in our haversax, and each and in, and endeavored
[01:06:57] to catch up anything we could snatch from a hut or cottage in our route.
[01:07:03] Many, even at this period, would have struggled from the ranks and perished, had not
[01:07:08] crowdfered, held them together with a firm rain.
[01:07:12] One such bold and stern commander in the east, during a memorable disaster, and that
[01:07:18] devoted army had reached its refuge unbroken.
[01:07:22] Thus we staggered on night and day for about four days before we discovered the reason
[01:07:28] of this forced march.
[01:07:31] And they find out that they're marching actually towards England, they're trying to get
[01:07:36] away, and this guy that I talked about Crawford, he's pretty significant.
[01:07:43] And here's a little talk about Crawford.
[01:07:46] Crawford seemed to sniff the sound of battle from afar with peculiar feelings.
[01:07:51] He halted us for a few minutes occasionally when the distant clamor became more distinct,
[01:07:55] and his face turned toward the sound and seemed to light up and become less stern.
[01:08:01] He was then indeed that every poor fellow clutched his weapon more firmly and wished for
[01:08:06] a sight of the enemy.
[01:08:09] Before long they had their wish.
[01:08:11] The enemy's cavalry were on our skirts that night, and as we rushed out of a small village,
[01:08:16] we turned to bay.
[01:08:20] So even though they were treating, they're still having to fight.
[01:08:24] And this again, this guy Crawford is definitely a powerful leader back to the book.
[01:08:31] I remember one evening during the retreat, he detected two men straying away from the main
[01:08:35] body.
[01:08:36] It was in the early stage of that disastrous flight and Crawford knew, and Crawford knew
[01:08:43] well that he must do his utmost to keep the division together.
[01:08:47] He halted the brigade with a voice of thunder, ordered a drum-head court martial on
[01:08:52] the instant, and they were sentenced to a hundred apiece.
[01:08:56] Allstahasty trial was taking place, Crawford dismounting from his horse stood in the
[01:09:01] midst, looking stern and angry as a worried bulldog.
[01:09:06] He did not like retreating at all that man.
[01:09:13] They march a little bit further, and then back to the book, ordering a square to be formed.
[01:09:18] He spoke to the brigade as well as I can remember in these words, after having ordered
[01:09:22] the three before named men of the 95th to be brought to the square.
[01:09:29] Although he said, I should obtain the goodwill neither of the officers nor the men of
[01:09:35] the brigade here by doing so, I am resolved to punish these three men according to the
[01:09:40] sentence awarded, even though the French are at our heels.
[01:09:45] Begin with Daniel Hauens.
[01:09:48] So these guys were looked like they were going to desert and they got caught and he had
[01:09:53] a court martial on the spot and he was going to give them a hundred lashes or whatever
[01:09:57] the number was.
[01:09:59] And even though they were running and retreating, he's, alright, we're going to administer
[01:10:05] this punishment now, even though it's not popular, I got to do it.
[01:10:10] Back to the book, this was indeed no time to be lax and discipline in the general knew it.
[01:10:14] The men, as I said, were some of them, becoming careless and roughly in their demeanor,
[01:10:21] whilst others again I saw with the tears falling down their cheeks from the agony of their
[01:10:27] bleeding feet and many were ill with dysentery and from the effects of bad food they had
[01:10:32] got a hold of and devoured on the road.
[01:10:34] Our Napsacks, too, were a bitter enemy in this prolonged march.
[01:10:39] Many a man died, I am convinced, who would have borne up well to the end of the retreat,
[01:10:43] but for the infernal load we carried on our backs.
[01:10:47] My own Napsack was my bitterest enemy.
[01:10:51] I felt it pressed me to the earth almost at times and more than once felt as if I should
[01:10:56] die under its deadly embrace.
[01:10:59] The Napsacks, in my opinion, should have been abandoned at the very commencement of the
[01:11:03] retrograde movement, as it would have been better to have lost them all together, if,
[01:11:08] by such loss, we could have saved the poor fellows who, as it was, died strapped to them
[01:11:14] on the road.
[01:11:18] There was some difficulty in finding a place to tie howling's up, as the light brigade
[01:11:22] carried no halberts.
[01:11:25] However, they led him to a slender astree which grew near at hand.
[01:11:30] Don't trouble yourselves about tying me up, said howling's folding his arms, I'll take
[01:11:34] my punishment like a man.
[01:11:38] He did so without a murmur receiving the whole 300.
[01:11:42] His wife, who was present with us, I remember was a strong, hearty Irish woman.
[01:11:49] So, I don't worry about tying me up, you hit me 300 times.
[01:11:54] We had a, you know they do the whipping thing with the, when you get your belt.
[01:11:59] Do you remember Irish John, you tall, pretty lanky and real good at your jitsu, and he
[01:12:07] got his blue belt.
[01:12:09] And he walked through the whipping hallway to get his belt, the gauntlet, he walked through
[01:12:16] the gauntlet, he just walked and stopped at each person and gave them the opportunity
[01:12:22] to give them all they got.
[01:12:25] That was pretty legit.
[01:12:27] He sounds like he sounds like my, he sounds like my boy, howling's right here.
[01:12:36] More about Crawford right here, this is classic.
[01:12:39] They're, they're getting to a river, they got across a river on their retreat.
[01:12:43] Back to the book, presently he spied an officer who to save himself from being wet through.
[01:12:47] I suppose, and wearing a damp pair of breeches for the remainder of the day, had mounted
[01:12:52] on the back of one of his men.
[01:12:57] The sight of such a piece of a feminacy was enough to raise the collar of the general,
[01:13:02] and in a very short time he was plunging and splashing through the water after them both,
[01:13:07] put him down, sir, put him down.
[01:13:09] I desire you to put that officer down instantly, and the soldier in an instant, I dare
[01:13:14] say, while dropping his burden like a hot potato into the stream continued his progress
[01:13:19] through.
[01:13:20] Return back, sir, said Crawford to the officer.
[01:13:23] And go through the water like the others.
[01:13:25] I will not allow my officers to ride upon the men's back through the rivers.
[01:13:30] They'll must take their share of light here.
[01:13:33] You can just go ahead and note that down as how to lead.
[01:13:37] That's just, that's a metaphorical and literal example.
[01:13:43] Hey, I'm going to ride on the back of my enlisted man so that I can stay dry.
[01:13:49] What a savage.
[01:13:50] I think that, that guy should have gotten some lashes.
[01:13:53] Back to the book, General Crawford was indeed one of the few men who was apparently
[01:13:58] created for the command during such dreadful scenes as we were familiar with in this retreat.
[01:14:03] He seemed an iron man, nothing dented him, nothing turned him from his purpose.
[01:14:09] War was his very element.
[01:14:12] And toil and danger seemed to call forth and increasing determination to surmount them.
[01:14:21] I'll let you get it. Now they are continuing to march and again, it's a story we've
[01:14:31] heard many times on here and how harsh foot marches can be.
[01:14:36] And at this point, rifleman Harris, he doesn't think he's going to make it.
[01:14:42] And he's fading fast.
[01:14:44] He's marching with a guy named Brooks.
[01:14:46] They're kind of broken up into pairs to try and stay together a little bit.
[01:14:50] He's trying to maintain back to the book.
[01:14:53] I remember sir, Dudley Hill passing me on a muel this day.
[01:14:57] He wore a Spanish straw hat and had his cloak on.
[01:15:00] He looked back when he had passed and addressed me.
[01:15:02] Harris said he, I see you cannot keep up.
[01:15:07] He peered very sorry for me for he knew me well.
[01:15:10] You must do your best, he said, my man and keep up with us.
[01:15:15] Or you will fall into the hands of the enemy.
[01:15:18] As the day wore on, I grew weaker and weaker and at last, spite all of my efforts.
[01:15:24] I saw the main body leave me hopelessly in the lurch.
[01:15:29] Brooks himself was getting weaker too.
[01:15:31] He saw it was a little used to urge me on and at length, ascending to my repeated requests
[01:15:37] to be left behind.
[01:15:39] He hurried on as well.
[01:15:41] And he was able without a word of farewell.
[01:15:47] I now soon sank down in the road and lay beside another man who had also fallen was apparently
[01:15:52] dead and whom I'd recognized as one of our sergeants named Taylor.
[01:16:06] Whilst we lay exhausted in the road, the rear guard, which was now endeavouring to drive
[01:16:12] on the stragglers approached and a sergeant of the rifles came up and stopped and look at
[01:16:17] us.
[01:16:18] He addressed himself to me and ordered me to rise, but I told him it was useless for him
[01:16:22] to trouble himself about me as I was unable to move a step further.
[01:16:29] Whilst he was urging me to endeavor to rise up, the officer in command of the rear guard
[01:16:33] also stepped up.
[01:16:35] The name of this officer was Lieutenant Cox.
[01:16:37] He was a brave and good man and observing that the sergeant was rough in his language
[01:16:41] and manner towards me, he silenced him and bade the guard proceed and leave me.
[01:16:49] Bet him die quietly, Hicks.
[01:16:50] He said to the sergeant, I know him well, he's not a man to lie here if he could get on.
[01:16:55] I'm sorry, Harris.
[01:16:58] He said to see you reduced to this fright fear, there is no help to be had now.
[01:17:06] He then moved on after his men and left me to my fate.
[01:17:15] Lot different than never leave a man behind.
[01:17:17] You've actually got people disengue.
[01:17:19] You're not going to make it.
[01:17:20] I can see you're not going to make it.
[01:17:21] I know you're a tough guy and if you're not walking right now, there's nothing for you.
[01:17:29] Now he lays there for a while and he actually wants to rest for a while.
[01:17:34] He regains a little bit of strength, he eventually crawls to a house, gets in the house
[01:17:40] and gets a little bit of food, gets a little bit of, I would love to say water, but
[01:17:45] he's not going to get his food and wine.
[01:17:48] He recovers somewhat, he pretty much recovers.
[01:17:54] Sleeps for a while wakes up, recovers and now he can walk again.
[01:17:59] What do you think would happen now?
[01:18:04] In a case as similar to this as possible, you know, but just now where I can't make it,
[01:18:09] what do you do, carry him?
[01:18:11] Yeah, you'd try and carry him, of course.
[01:18:13] Other guys, guys.
[01:18:14] Yeah, and it's horrible to think of these situations where if we have to move these men
[01:18:23] and to sit there, let's away this.
[01:18:26] You have to weigh this, if we try and carry it all over a wounded out, none of us are going
[01:18:31] to live.
[01:18:32] That's what that's the situation that they're likely facing.
[01:18:37] Hey, you're either going to get out of here yourself and people don't understand how hard
[01:18:42] it is to carry it down, man.
[01:18:43] It's very, very difficult to carry it down, man.
[01:18:46] Especially across terrain, you know, sometimes in wrestling practice, you pick up and
[01:18:50] you pick up your partner and you do a couple of laps, right?
[01:18:53] Yeah, you know, that's all good, you're on a nice smooth surface.
[01:18:57] Because cooperating is not just dead weight, yeah, when you start carrying bodies around,
[01:19:02] it's really, really difficult.
[01:19:04] So you don't, it's not a one to one either.
[01:19:07] So if one guy is down, it's not just one person carries that guy.
[01:19:11] It actually has to be two or sometimes three.
[01:19:14] When you have gear on, and we have methods of carrying guys, I mean, I can carry you
[01:19:19] a little while, right? But after a little while, you know, be that 500 meters, 1000 meters,
[01:19:28] you're not going to be here for, and also you're combat in effect.
[01:19:30] If you can't, you can't utilize your weapon properly, not for, not for any length of time.
[01:19:36] So, you know, in a situation like this, that the decision that these leaders are making
[01:19:40] is, hey, guess what?
[01:19:42] If we don't just keep walking, we're going to get overrun.
[01:19:45] The French are going to catch us and we're all going to die.
[01:19:47] So Harris, you got nothing for you.
[01:19:49] So in content like now, we'll say that if there was a circumstance like that, where we're
[01:19:54] going to lose more guys if we bring this guy with us or one big luxury that we have now
[01:20:03] is we have air support.
[01:20:05] So the enemy wants to keep coming out of us, cool.
[01:20:08] We'll sit here and call drop bombs on them all day.
[01:20:10] The situations like that have happened over and over again in the modern wars.
[01:20:14] And in Iraq and Afghanistan, where small elements are out there in the field, they're about
[01:20:19] to get overrun and the aircraft and air, air power comes in and completely saves the
[01:20:24] day and keeps the enemy at bay for extended periods of time.
[01:20:29] So we have an option, another option.
[01:20:32] But in the, I guess, the ultimately be hypothetical then.
[01:20:36] The case.
[01:20:37] So hypothetically, then you got to put someone in that situation and see what they're
[01:20:39] going to do.
[01:20:40] And that's the decision you got to make as a leader on the spot.
[01:20:44] Yeah.
[01:20:45] Yeah.
[01:20:46] I mean, you be weighing all these micro micro facets that are happening.
[01:20:51] How far away are the bad guys?
[01:20:53] Yeah.
[01:20:54] Well, how many of them are there?
[01:20:55] Do I reinforcements coming?
[01:20:56] Is there any terrain I can take?
[01:20:57] Is there what, you know, what can I do?
[01:21:00] How many people are down?
[01:21:01] Yeah.
[01:21:02] You do have to weigh all these things out and make a decision.
[01:21:04] It's going to be hard decision.
[01:21:06] Yeah, for sure.
[01:21:07] I mean, so you don't put like the the concept or should I say, like the action.
[01:21:13] The action of at least trying to bring the guy with you ahead of like other guys lives.
[01:21:21] So I'm a certain circumstance like this where you have to, you don't have any content.
[01:21:27] You don't have any support.
[01:21:28] You don't have any other options.
[01:21:30] It's either other guys die or we leave this guy behind.
[01:21:35] The fact that you tried to bring the guy doesn't Trump like the lives of other guys.
[01:21:45] If the decision is to be made where it's understood like other guys would have died.
[01:21:49] If we didn't leave this guy here, that would be okay.
[01:21:53] It's not gonna be okay and you're gonna have to live with one horrible thought or the
[01:21:57] other.
[01:21:58] Right, right.
[01:21:59] The thing that's powerful about we're not gonna leave everything anyone behind.
[01:22:03] The thing that's powerful about that is if that's your default mode, your default mode is
[01:22:09] to fight and that's what that's a we train.
[01:22:12] That's when I say we I mean like America trains, we're not gonna leave you behind.
[01:22:16] And so when that's your go to attitude, that's your go to attitude.
[01:22:20] And all the thoughts about hey, we'll weigh it out and there's like no we're gonna fight,
[01:22:24] we're gonna kill everyone and we're gonna do everything we can to bring everyone back
[01:22:28] that's what we do.
[01:22:30] And that is a powerful thing.
[01:22:32] Yeah, man, these are savage times.
[01:22:35] These are savage times, savage times.
[01:22:39] Going, so like I said, he does recover though, luckily before the French get to him,
[01:22:44] he recovers enough to get out start walking again.
[01:22:48] And he talks a little bit how he was clinging, I mean he was clinging to survival.
[01:22:55] Back to the book, it is however indeed astonishing how a man clings to life.
[01:23:00] I am certain that had I laying down at this period, I should have found my last billet
[01:23:05] on the spot I sank upon.
[01:23:08] Suddenly I heard a shout in the front, which was prolonged in a sort of hub hub.
[01:23:14] Even the stragglers who I saw dotting the road in front of me seem to have caught something
[01:23:18] like hope.
[01:23:20] And as the poor fellows now reach the top of the hill where a sending a hernicational exclamation
[01:23:25] of joy, the first note of the sort I had heard for many days, when I reached the top
[01:23:31] of the hill, the thing spoke for itself, their far away in our front, the English shipping
[01:23:38] lay inside.
[01:23:40] It's a view, had indeed acted like a restorative to our force and the men at the prospect
[01:23:50] of the termination of such a march had plucked up spirit for a last effort.
[01:23:56] Fellows who, like myself, seemed hardly have strengthened their legs to creep up the
[01:24:02] assent seemed now to have picked up a fresh pair to get down with, such as hope to us poor
[01:24:09] mortals.
[01:24:10] So they obviously see the ships and that inspires them and they start moving a little
[01:24:19] bit faster.
[01:24:20] Back to the book, there was a recollect of the name of Bell of the rifles who had been
[01:24:27] during this day holding a sort of creeping race with me.
[01:24:30] We had passed and repost each other as our strength served.
[01:24:33] Bell was a rather discontented fellow at the best of times.
[01:24:37] But during this retreat, he had given full scope to his ill temper, cursing the hour he
[01:24:42] was born and wishing his mother had strangled him when he came into the world in order
[01:24:47] to have saved him from his present toil.
[01:24:51] He had not now spoken for some time and the sight of the English shipping had apparently
[01:24:57] a very beneficial effect upon him.
[01:25:01] He burst into tears as he stood and looked at it.
[01:25:03] Harris, he said, if it pleases God to let me reach those ships, I swear never to utter
[01:25:09] a bad or discontented word again.
[01:25:16] Appreciation.
[01:25:18] And he did make to the ships and Harris, rifleman Harris made to the ships and they
[01:25:26] got embarked on those ships and they sailed back to England for a few days and then
[01:25:35] get off the English shore and then finally back to the book, one fine morning received
[01:25:39] orders to disembark and our poor bare feet once more touched English ground.
[01:25:47] The inhabitants flocked down to the beach to see us as we did so and they must have been
[01:25:51] a good deal surprised at the spectacle we presented.
[01:25:56] Our beards were long and ragged, almost all were without shoes and stockings.
[01:26:02] Many had their clothes and accoutrements and fragments with their heads swath in old rags
[01:26:07] and our weapons were covered with rust, whilst not a few had now from toil and fatigue
[01:26:13] become quite blind.
[01:26:17] Let not the reader however think that now we were to be despised as soldiers, long marches,
[01:26:24] inclement weather and want to food had done their work upon us but we were perhaps better
[01:26:29] than we appeared as the sequel showed.
[01:26:33] Under the gallant Crawford we had made some tremendous marches and even galt our enemy
[01:26:39] so severely making good our retreat.
[01:26:44] But our comrades in adversity who had retired by the other road under general more turned
[01:26:50] to bay there and showed the enemy that the English soldier is not to be beaten even under
[01:26:55] the most adverse circumstances.
[01:27:00] It fueled the death and slaughter, the march, the Bivouac and the retreat are no bad places
[01:27:07] in which to judge men.
[01:27:12] I have had some opportunities of judging them in all these situations and I should say
[01:27:17] that the British are amongst the most splendid soldiers in the world.
[01:27:22] Give them fair play and they are unconscribable.
[01:27:26] For my own part I can only say that I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I
[01:27:33] have ever done since.
[01:27:36] And as I sit at work in my shop in Richmond Street, so ho, I look back upon that portion
[01:27:44] of my time spent in the field of the peninsula as the only part where the overmembrants.
[01:27:53] It is at such times that scenes long past come back upon my mind as if they had taken place
[01:27:59] but yesterday.
[01:28:02] I remember even the appearance of some regiments engaged in comrades long, molded to dust.
[01:28:13] I see again performing the acts of heroes.
[01:28:30] And I think it's safe to call Rifleman Benjamin Randall Harris a hero as well.
[01:28:53] And at the same time I think it's important to remember that these heroes are not super
[01:29:06] heroes like we see today in movies.
[01:29:10] They don't wear a cape.
[01:29:12] They don't have any superhuman strength.
[01:29:14] They have no special powers what they do have is they have will to fight the will to drive
[01:29:27] on the will to live the will to win.
[01:29:36] And I think that's the superpower.
[01:29:43] And it never ceases to amaze me.
[01:29:45] These are normal people.
[01:29:48] Rifleman Harris was a normal guy like us.
[01:29:58] But when called upon to march, they march and when called upon to fight.
[01:30:06] They fight and when called upon to rise up and overcome.
[01:30:10] They do just that they rise up and overcome.
[01:30:22] And that shows us that we can do the same thing in the challenges that we face.
[01:30:33] We can do the same thing.
[01:30:39] And overcome.
[01:30:47] And I think that's all I've got for tonight's so echo.
[01:30:55] Perhaps if you could let people know how they can support themselves and maybe if they
[01:31:02] want to support this podcast as well.
[01:31:06] It's crazy how these marches.
[01:31:08] Right.
[01:31:09] Brutal.
[01:31:10] Yeah.
[01:31:11] And this is I don't know.
[01:31:12] Maybe from what I can remember the worst one.
[01:31:15] Especially I'll be talking about with no shoes.
[01:31:18] Their shoes probably just fall off with them first, you know, little bit.
[01:31:22] And then they're walking with no shoes or barely any shoes or whatever.
[01:31:26] Crying straight up just from the march.
[01:31:27] By the way, not the, not the war or anything like that.
[01:31:32] Where the marches yet.
[01:31:36] This is big of an enemy.
[01:31:38] He said his pack was his biggest enemy.
[01:31:40] He had literally the death.
[01:31:42] The kind where guys are still killing them.
[01:31:45] Killings killing them.
[01:31:48] So we just cut back from Utah obviously.
[01:31:52] And you know, after every, we're doing that training where, you know, we brief debrief.
[01:31:57] Go down exercise brief.
[01:31:59] And then you know, we walk back and forth.
[01:32:00] Right.
[01:32:01] So, okay.
[01:32:02] So, echo.
[01:32:03] I'll just tell people have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:32:05] So, I'll just find echo.
[01:32:06] We just got echelon front, did a FTX field training exercise with the company.
[01:32:12] We were in Utah.
[01:32:13] We brought echo out so that he could get some footage and whatnot.
[01:32:17] And so, so that's what we're talking about.
[01:32:19] So we're in the field.
[01:32:21] We're doing basically urban and combat with a group of, let's call them regular people,
[01:32:28] business people that are learning leadership through experiential.
[01:32:35] Environments.
[01:32:36] Yeah.
[01:32:37] It's an interesting one.
[01:32:38] It's like a con, you know how, if you don't communicate with someone effectively,
[01:32:46] it's falling apart.
[01:32:47] Right.
[01:32:48] Or if you don't, you know, it's like, and that's exactly what you're going to say.
[01:32:51] And it's drawn out, stitching in life.
[01:32:53] But this is like a condensed version of that.
[01:32:56] Yes.
[01:32:57] So, if you don't communicate with someone during an FTX, you know, within like 30 seconds
[01:33:03] that something just went wrong.
[01:33:04] And now we're getting shot in the face with airsoft rifles.
[01:33:08] Yeah.
[01:33:09] It's just fun.
[01:33:10] It's really fun to watch from the outside.
[01:33:12] Yeah.
[01:33:13] Because you see it.
[01:33:14] And I've been to another one too.
[01:33:16] And yeah, you see it.
[01:33:17] And it's interesting how in the beginning it's like, it's almost impossible.
[01:33:20] Right.
[01:33:21] And immediately communication breaks down immediately.
[01:33:25] And then towards the end, you start to see people communicating, getting it.
[01:33:29] You know, like, you kind of, a lot of times you got to over communicate.
[01:33:32] Yeah, for sure.
[01:33:33] But the more you do that, the more effective it is.
[01:33:36] It's so crazy to watch.
[01:33:38] It is.
[01:33:39] And I don't know if you remember Dave saying this.
[01:33:41] Dave told them.
[01:33:42] He said, Jocco just told you the mistakes that you're going to make.
[01:33:46] You told you what you're going to do.
[01:33:49] And you're going to do it.
[01:33:51] And then sure enough, and we're missing the one of them.
[01:33:53] The funniest was the one individual that said they came up with a plan for something.
[01:33:58] And we said, you know, you're risking to get a blue on blue on blue there.
[01:34:02] And she said, she said, listen, I understand what you're saying.
[01:34:06] But it's not like we're going to walk in there and start shooting each other.
[01:34:10] Yeah.
[01:34:11] That's not going to happen.
[01:34:12] And and sure enough, that very girl was in a stressful situation.
[01:34:16] And they ended a building from two different sides at the same time.
[01:34:19] And sure enough, she, she dusted one of her, one of her teammates.
[01:34:24] And it was, you know, it's one of those things.
[01:34:26] Yeah.
[01:34:27] I said, remember what you said yesterday?
[01:34:28] She said, yeah.
[01:34:29] Oh, yeah, I remember.
[01:34:30] So just in, and I had the luxury of seeing it from the outside.
[01:34:34] Oh, yeah.
[01:34:35] So you can feel it though.
[01:34:36] Oh, yeah.
[01:34:37] But you're in a different situation position than me.
[01:34:41] Anyway, the point is, so the terrain there was where the field and where you actually
[01:34:48] do that that field training part of it is like, well, what would you say?
[01:34:52] What?
[01:34:53] Just do a hundred yards away from the where you do the brief and debrief.
[01:34:56] It is about 400 yards.
[01:34:58] Yeah.
[01:34:59] So it's a little bit of a track.
[01:35:00] 300 yards.
[01:35:01] If you're doing it again and again, multiple times.
[01:35:03] So you're going brief exercise, debrief, brief exit, you know, so kind of all day, really.
[01:35:12] So, and this was a situation where there was a hill and rocky, you know, hill.
[01:35:17] So I'm walking right now, my camera the whole time.
[01:35:19] And it's not slay to the my other camera, but, you know, it's something.
[01:35:24] And so I'm walking back and forth all day, all day, where my feet are starting to get
[01:35:28] like kind of tired.
[01:35:29] And I'm thinking every single time though, every single time I'm thinking, this is nothing.
[01:35:36] Compared to what you guys really do.
[01:35:39] Yeah.
[01:35:40] You know how nothing it was?
[01:35:41] I didn't that thought didn't even go across my mind at all in any way, shape or something.
[01:35:45] You know what I'm saying about that is while I'm walking, this was like, after lunch
[01:35:49] time.
[01:35:50] I'm thinking, and I'm seeing you guys and everyone's cruising and I'm thinking, is everyone
[01:35:52] trying to act like this isn't like kind of kind of terrain?
[01:35:55] I literally didn't think of it until you said this to me right now.
[01:35:58] Yeah, the biggest, I was totally acting like, well, there's nothing.
[01:36:01] No, I wasn't going to.
[01:36:02] I was going to, I, yeah, brother, I had a lot of stuff.
[01:36:05] Yeah, and it helps.
[01:36:06] Yeah, it does.
[01:36:07] But the fact is, do you do actually better when you pretend that it doesn't bother you?
[01:36:12] Yes, that's right.
[01:36:13] Yeah, we're going to remember that night in the night in the, so we started acting
[01:36:17] all tired, accepting, showing everyone.
[01:36:20] Yeah, it's true.
[01:36:22] But nonetheless, the fact is, it wasn't nothing.
[01:36:25] It wasn't nothing.
[01:36:26] It felt it, and, you know, so I'm just funny.
[01:36:30] I'm looking at you guys something like, hey, I wonder if these guys are, you know, but
[01:36:34] no one said anything.
[01:36:35] No, nobody said dang, these tracks are getting long.
[01:36:38] That's because they were 300 meters, bro.
[01:36:40] I feel like they're just saying.
[01:36:44] But nonetheless, so every time I feel anything like that, I think of like, you guys first
[01:36:51] and you guys are doing it in like crazy heat too, gear and like all this stuff.
[01:36:56] And I think of this kind guys, these kind guys.
[01:36:58] Yeah.
[01:36:59] Right from inheritance.
[01:37:00] The right from inheritance.
[01:37:01] Feet all tore up, starving, starving.
[01:37:06] Starving.
[01:37:07] No sleep.
[01:37:08] No water.
[01:37:09] No water.
[01:37:10] And people are trying to kill you.
[01:37:11] Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:37:12] So that's the point, man.
[01:37:13] Yeah.
[01:37:14] Because if these guys can rise and overcome that, then what, figure your personal potential.
[01:37:19] Yeah.
[01:37:20] Right?
[01:37:21] Yeah.
[01:37:22] Think of it.
[01:37:23] Think of what more you could do.
[01:37:24] Yeah.
[01:37:25] I've got to look and bother some of your guys.
[01:37:27] Yeah, that looked like that.
[01:37:28] You're like, I made some dope videos though.
[01:37:30] We're about to make a huge excuse right now too.
[01:37:33] Which I don't even know if it's an excuse, but it's a factor where these like hard actual
[01:37:39] hard times kind of call on you to exercise this kind of will.
[01:37:45] And I think a lot of times we're not like hard times don't call on us.
[01:37:49] Like this anyway.
[01:37:50] I mean, hard times do, you know.
[01:37:51] But you know what though?
[01:37:55] You should, I mean, technically and potentially you should be able to exercise as much
[01:38:01] will as it takes.
[01:38:03] Really?
[01:38:04] Now when you consider kind of the limits.
[01:38:06] Right?
[01:38:07] Because these are the limits.
[01:38:08] These are the limits.
[01:38:09] This is one of the stories where the guys like I'm done.
[01:38:12] Yeah.
[01:38:13] He's a little bit more.
[01:38:14] I'm done.
[01:38:15] Guys are saying, hey, if you stay here, you're going to die.
[01:38:16] He's like, yeah, I cannot move anymore.
[01:38:18] No.
[01:38:19] You know, what point are you at when you cannot save your own life by walking?
[01:38:24] You can't walk.
[01:38:25] You can't take another step.
[01:38:28] And he came back from that.
[01:38:30] Yeah.
[01:38:31] Jay.
[01:38:32] Yeah.
[01:38:33] And they told really good job in illustrating it.
[01:38:36] Because you, or talking about it, where, because he mentioned the no shoes thing a few
[01:38:41] times.
[01:38:42] Yeah.
[01:38:43] He did.
[01:38:44] But again, I bet if, yeah.
[01:38:46] Yeah.
[01:38:47] He does a great job.
[01:38:50] But you can't even begin to, yeah, you can't even begin to really get the point across.
[01:38:57] Yeah.
[01:38:58] The way it is.
[01:38:59] As the leader, I was talking to a guy the other day.
[01:39:03] That went to Buds and didn't make it through.
[01:39:06] And I know them for a while.
[01:39:08] And I just said, like, hey, man, you know, you're a good dude.
[01:39:13] You know, what?
[01:39:14] Why did you?
[01:39:15] Why did you quit?
[01:39:17] And he said, you know what?
[01:39:18] It just sucked.
[01:39:19] And I was like, okay, but didn't you know it was going to suck?
[01:39:22] And he said, yeah, I knew it was going to suck.
[01:39:25] But at the same time, you know, I watched on TV and I thought to myself, okay, yeah,
[01:39:30] that's going to suck.
[01:39:31] He said, so I thought I understood how it was going to suck.
[01:39:35] But I didn't understand how it was going to suck.
[01:39:37] And then I was there.
[01:39:38] I said, this really sucks.
[01:39:39] And he quit.
[01:39:40] And again, a good dude that, that I'm kind of, you know, thinking myself, why?
[01:39:46] I'm trying to figure out why people quit.
[01:39:49] And that was what he said.
[01:39:50] He said much like we're saying, because much of you could imagine.
[01:39:53] And you think you're self-alman.
[01:39:55] Yeah.
[01:39:56] But I think I could make that one more step.
[01:39:58] You don't know.
[01:39:59] You're known to you.
[01:40:00] You've been dehydrated.
[01:40:01] Having people trying to shoot you, cleaning up your buddies brains off your jacket
[01:40:07] for weeks, months on end.
[01:40:09] Your dehydrated.
[01:40:10] And now you have no shoes, no stockings.
[01:40:13] And you're doing a forced march on this road for this, but they march four days without
[01:40:20] stopping.
[01:40:21] What even is that?
[01:40:22] No, no, no, dang.
[01:40:23] Yeah.
[01:40:24] Yeah.
[01:40:25] That's it.
[01:40:26] I mean, you.
[01:40:30] This kind of, that's not to mention like, no medical care.
[01:40:34] No.
[01:40:35] No one's coming to save you.
[01:40:37] You know what?
[01:40:38] You know what?
[01:40:39] You know what?
[01:40:40] If you have an ingrown toenail.
[01:40:44] Right, right, like, like, a little thing that is Bob, it actually bothers you in actual life.
[01:40:49] Yeah.
[01:40:50] Think if you had that here, or you have a, or you have, let's say you got a spring
[01:40:53] ankle.
[01:40:54] A bad spring ankle.
[01:40:56] I spray my ankle really bad before.
[01:40:58] Sure.
[01:40:59] You can't walk on it.
[01:41:01] Well, now you don't have a choice.
[01:41:02] You either walk on it or you die.
[01:41:04] I think about the little things that are that caused you an inconvenience right now.
[01:41:09] I think about what an inconvenience that is in this situation.
[01:41:13] Think about your little infection and your fingers, you know, your finger, you're, you've
[01:41:17] ever had one of those little stupid, like, where your fingernails get a little infection
[01:41:21] there?
[01:41:22] Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:23] Think about that.
[01:41:24] And that you don't have no medicine.
[01:41:25] You don't have any way of, yeah, that's the things you're going to turn into
[01:41:27] in giant infection.
[01:41:28] Yeah.
[01:41:29] You die.
[01:41:30] This is the little, little tiny things that annoy you are, will kill you back in the
[01:41:36] day.
[01:41:37] Yeah.
[01:41:38] Check.
[01:41:39] Yeah.
[01:41:40] So what we have to do is prepare for these hard times.
[01:41:42] Do you have any advice on how we could help prepare ourselves for these hard times?
[01:41:45] On top of referencing these scenarios.
[01:41:52] I reference your guys scenario.
[01:41:53] Like, basically, everything that you guys tell me and talk about, like, how it's super hot.
[01:41:59] How you don't sleep as much.
[01:42:00] I'm not talking about bad and talking about, like, Ian Ramadi.
[01:42:03] I call these up.
[01:42:04] I kind of imagine that helps.
[01:42:06] It's coldly helps.
[01:42:07] That's good.
[01:42:08] Because it helps me to think about right from the Harris.
[01:42:10] Yeah.
[01:42:11] Don't.
[01:42:12] For sure.
[01:42:13] And to speak in a help.
[01:42:15] Speaking of helping yourself.
[01:42:17] All right.
[01:42:18] So you're, in a way, this is kind of a dichotomy here.
[01:42:23] Because you don't like when you're joined to get sore.
[01:42:25] I'm talking about cruel.
[01:42:26] I want to hear a fair real quick.
[01:42:29] That you can be a self-pream luxury.
[01:42:31] Yeah.
[01:42:32] You're right from the Harris, you know.
[01:42:33] Yeah.
[01:42:34] So, Joy-Wiffer, who knows?
[01:42:36] I have no thumbs.
[01:42:37] I'm pretty sure it may be wouldn't stop that day.
[01:42:39] That time.
[01:42:40] It's a pretty luxury.
[01:42:41] Yeah.
[01:42:42] Supreme luxury.
[01:42:43] Where now it's like, hey, my joints.
[01:42:45] I'm getting older.
[01:42:46] My joints kind of hurt.
[01:42:47] I can't.
[01:42:48] I can't work out at the gym.
[01:42:51] You know, at my leisure.
[01:42:54] As good, let me take some joint warfare.
[01:42:56] You know, improve my comfort while I work out.
[01:43:00] Function for sure.
[01:43:01] Function.
[01:43:02] But comfort has a lot to do with it.
[01:43:04] You know, with sore joints is way less comfortable than not sore joint.
[01:43:07] Yeah.
[01:43:08] I'm going to say though, there's exercises that you cannot do when you're doing
[01:43:12] it right at your rock and roll.
[01:43:14] Yeah.
[01:43:15] So, you can push yourself harder and be better prepared for the hard times if you're
[01:43:20] working correctly.
[01:43:21] If your joints are working correctly.
[01:43:22] Yeah.
[01:43:23] That's a dichotomy.
[01:43:24] And there also is no like concession.
[01:43:29] There's no reason to say, hey, my joints being less
[01:43:34] healthy is a good is fine.
[01:43:36] Is good.
[01:43:37] That's a good thing.
[01:43:38] You know, so you have a choice.
[01:43:40] Should I maintain or improve the joint?
[01:43:44] My joint health of my body, including but not limited to joints or should I not?
[01:43:50] The decision should never be.
[01:43:52] I'm not.
[01:43:53] Never be.
[01:43:54] I think that's what's my opinion.
[01:43:55] Anyway, so the point is so jocquism supplements.
[01:44:00] Joint.
[01:44:01] So it's for your joints.
[01:44:02] It's best kind of supplements as someone with a level head now is for a supplements
[01:44:08] goes.
[01:44:09] Go.
[01:44:10] I think the joint for your joints.
[01:44:14] You know, bones.
[01:44:18] Maybe stuff that's going to be stronger.
[01:44:20] Structural.
[01:44:21] Yeah.
[01:44:22] Structural support.
[01:44:23] Because again, and I said, it's like if you're going for a cool protein
[01:44:28] powder, a lot of people that say, hey, what's a good protein powder?
[01:44:31] Because I think you don't stake.
[01:44:32] Like how much protein do you like not get to need supplemental protein?
[01:44:38] Well, people know, people want that because it's getting the convenience.
[01:44:42] That's why people like those.
[01:44:44] I'm going to make one that's going to be both convenient and tasty and good.
[01:44:49] All right.
[01:44:50] There you go.
[01:44:52] Nonetheless, that's cool.
[01:44:53] I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
[01:44:55] I'm saying as far as like the importance of focusing on a supplement, the most benefit
[01:45:01] is that you're spending your convenience that really.
[01:45:05] For sure.
[01:45:06] That supplementing protein.
[01:45:07] You're supplementing convenience.
[01:45:08] Nothing wrong with that.
[01:45:09] Nothing wrong with that.
[01:45:10] We got a lot to do.
[01:45:11] I understand.
[01:45:12] But as far as like the what do you call it, the hierarchy of supplements.
[01:45:16] You're in the same change.
[01:45:17] Jordan B. Peter's in supplements.
[01:45:18] You're in the house.
[01:45:19] The dominant hierarchy of supplements.
[01:45:23] The the drill oil.
[01:45:24] Omega threes.
[01:45:25] Like these kinds of things that help you directly.
[01:45:29] That's the main one.
[01:45:30] Anyway.
[01:45:31] So your point in all this is.
[01:45:34] Just a supplement.
[01:45:36] Legit supplements.
[01:45:39] Super krill oil.
[01:45:41] Jocco super krill is what's called.
[01:45:42] It's krill oil for you joints and join warfare.
[01:45:47] Where do you get them?
[01:45:49] Origin main dot com.
[01:45:50] Okay.
[01:45:51] Thank you.
[01:45:52] Brown, I'm telling you, I feel like.
[01:45:54] Your drawing this out way too much.
[01:45:56] If I was doing this to be like, if you want to have good healthy joints, get some
[01:46:01] krill oil, super krill and get some joint warfare from originmain.com, M.A.I.N.E.
[01:46:08] Yeah.
[01:46:09] But, and then we'd be good.
[01:46:10] We'd be moving on the next thing.
[01:46:11] Yeah, no, I dig it.
[01:46:12] And I want to read the time at the hierarchy.
[01:46:14] Here's the thing.
[01:46:15] The dominant number.
[01:46:16] No, it's a little bit like, remember, and this makes sense.
[01:46:19] This is relevant.
[01:46:20] Your get all serious with me.
[01:46:21] It's not going to prove you point.
[01:46:22] Because you're not doing it.
[01:46:23] I'm going to prove it because I'm not.
[01:46:24] I'm going to prove it because I'm not.
[01:46:25] Because back out of your element out of your.
[01:46:26] Again, again, when I was, we'll say 23.
[01:46:32] I don't know, take some fos for something.
[01:46:35] Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:36] I just got stuff.
[01:46:37] Yeah.
[01:46:38] Yeah.
[01:46:39] So what if someone, listening, or group people listening, who have that same mindset,
[01:46:45] and it's not because not because I knew both things.
[01:46:48] And I would just, I just didn't know.
[01:46:50] OK.
[01:46:51] So I'm going to say, now, so now we know.
[01:46:52] Yeah, well, that's good.
[01:46:52] If there's someone that doesn't know that, maybe they turn this off.
[01:46:55] Like eight minutes ago.
[01:46:56] Maybe maybe not four, maybe they're more educated now, and maybe boom.
[01:46:59] They're now they're looking into the joint situation.
[01:47:02] That's what I think is happening.
[01:47:03] That's my opinion.
[01:47:04] Hey, care.
[01:47:05] That's my prediction.
[01:47:06] I'm sure Twitter will let us know.
[01:47:08] Anyway, the origin main.com on the top.
[01:47:11] Click labs.
[01:47:12] Actually, it's right in the front page.
[01:47:13] I keep forgetting that.
[01:47:14] It's right in the front page.
[01:47:15] Boom.
[01:47:16] Super curl.
[01:47:17] Super curl.
[01:47:18] And joint warfare.
[01:47:19] Get on it.
[01:47:20] There's also some geys and rash guards.
[01:47:21] People been asking me years now.
[01:47:24] I don't think I should get it.
[01:47:25] I started to do this.
[01:47:26] What geys should I get?
[01:47:27] We know now.
[01:47:28] We know now.
[01:47:29] 100% all made in America from the content from the seeds of the content.
[01:47:33] Planted harvested process.
[01:47:35] That's pretty much the seeds did do.
[01:47:38] The seeds.
[01:47:39] Yeah.
[01:47:40] Well, that's an exciting thing.
[01:47:44] I'm just saying.
[01:47:45] Yeah.
[01:47:46] If you're into that kind of stuff.
[01:47:47] But nonetheless, you know, Pete makes it in Maine.
[01:47:51] Formulate to the fabric.
[01:47:52] Boom.
[01:47:53] That's a lot of stuff too.
[01:47:54] By the way, clothing.
[01:47:56] Pete has more of like a stylish kind of twist on his clothing.
[01:47:59] Yeah.
[01:48:00] In fact, I always, who was it?
[01:48:02] Oh, Dave Burke.
[01:48:03] Yeah.
[01:48:04] And we're in Utah.
[01:48:05] Yeah.
[01:48:06] Had the origin, the hoodie.
[01:48:07] Yeah.
[01:48:08] And the hoodie has like, I don't know if you know this kind of stuff.
[01:48:10] But like, there's certain cuts of like hoodie and stuff.
[01:48:14] And even though it's like a new one.
[01:48:15] No, my cutters excel.
[01:48:16] Yeah.
[01:48:17] I see.
[01:48:18] It goes beyond that.
[01:48:19] No.
[01:48:20] Yes, it does.
[01:48:21] Anyway, Mike, you know, it's noticeable for people who want to know
[01:48:23] this.
[01:48:24] No, but I noticed that.
[01:48:25] I'm going to get it.
[01:48:26] That's good.
[01:48:27] That's a good hoodie.
[01:48:28] And just a pull over one.
[01:48:29] You know, come on.
[01:48:30] Dave.
[01:48:31] Yeah.
[01:48:32] It's something.
[01:48:33] It's not nothing.
[01:48:34] Nothing.
[01:48:35] Nonetheless, it's all made in America.
[01:48:38] And there is this little stylish twist.
[01:48:40] If you're there, then notice.
[01:48:41] If you care to notice.
[01:48:43] It has some fashion style.
[01:48:45] It's baked in there.
[01:48:46] If you don't notice, you don't notice.
[01:48:48] Cause you, you ever wore the, you wore the hoodie, right?
[01:48:51] Functional.
[01:48:52] Yeah.
[01:48:53] I'm not used to 19 degrees.

[01:52:23] Yeah.
[01:52:23] You know things that I don't know.
[01:52:24] Because they're detached.
[01:52:25] And they have different expertise, by the way.

[01:52:56] Wait, what do you mean?
[01:52:57] Like the whole episode?

[01:53:08] And now it's more recognizable.
[01:53:09] Yeah.
[01:53:10] So it's like drilling a little bit.
[01:53:12] Yeah.
[01:53:13] No, I'm going to come back.
[01:53:14] I'm going to drill so far.
[01:53:15] Yeah.
[01:53:16] And something, you know how like certain things just apply to you more.
[01:53:19] Like if you're, you're advice on, I don't know,
[01:53:21] college that's easy when you remember about how to approach college.
[01:53:24] Right?
[01:53:25] Crash college or whatever.
[01:53:26] It's going to apply to me more if I'm actually in college.
[01:53:29] Yeah.
[01:53:30] Let's just apply that to other things in life.
[01:53:32] Which you can easily do.
[01:53:33] You can.
[01:53:34] For sure.
[01:53:35] But that's going to apply to me directly.
[01:53:36] We'll say.
[01:53:37] You know, more than maybe the next guy.
[01:53:39] So that kind of stuff where.
[01:53:42] That one I want to remember.
[01:53:44] Okay.
[01:53:45] I'm going to come back to that one.
[01:53:46] If I can constantly remind myself of the things that directly apply to me,
[01:53:50] you can be more, it's going to be more beneficial rather than just listening to all the podcast and hoping you remember each one.
[01:53:55] Nonetheless.
[01:53:56] Point there is that's that's a good reason to subscribe to the YouTube channel.
[01:54:00] So if you, in fact, if the excerpts or some excerpts resonate with you.
[01:54:07] You got him there. You fingertips and you can share.
[01:54:10] Also.
[01:54:12] Jocquoise is store. It's called Jocquoise store.

[01:54:17] There. That's where you can get if you want.
[01:54:20] Sure.
[01:54:21] Do you don't even know what URL is any more?
[01:54:23] Of course they do.
[01:54:24] Do you think so?
[01:54:25] I think that's common language.
[01:54:27] No.
[01:54:28] Actually, no.
[01:54:28] I think you're right.
[01:54:29] You're actually called a website.
[01:54:30] Website.
[01:54:30] Yeah. The website.
[01:54:31] What is your URL stand for?
[01:54:33] See, well, I don't even know.
[01:54:34] See.
[01:54:35] You better forgot.
[01:54:37] No, I'm actually not a tech guy.
[01:54:39] Yeah, but you knew I was a little old man.
[01:54:41] I knew what it meant.
[01:54:43] I don't know what it stands for.
[01:54:45] You know, I don't know.
[01:54:47] Universal something?
[01:54:48] Ask your brother.
[01:54:49] I know.
[01:54:50] It's probably not even universal.
[01:54:52] J-trolls.
[01:54:53] Nonetheless, it's Jocquoise.
[01:54:55] The website is jocquoisestore.com.
[01:54:58] I know.
[01:54:59] Not that creative.
[01:55:00] But, easy to remember.
[01:55:02] That's where you can get the shirts.
[01:55:04] Hoodies, rashguards, compression, rashguards, if you will.
[01:55:08] We're very sectivities where you maintain your range of motion.
[01:55:12] J-tjutsu specifically in my opinion.
[01:55:17] Hoodies on their hoodies.
[01:55:19] All the hoodies.
[01:55:20] They're the same design, but though they're the heavy ones.
[01:55:22] People ask me and ask me, like, are these the heavy ones?
[01:55:24] Or where's the heavy hoodies?
[01:55:25] Well, the the heavy ones.
[01:55:26] The heavy ones.
[01:55:27] We saw like the non heavy ones.
[01:55:29] We'll call them.
[01:55:30] I thought they were heavy.
[01:55:31] Yeah.
[01:55:32] The first kind of iteration.
[01:55:33] Exactly.
[01:55:33] Where?
[01:55:34] Those were all sold out.
[01:55:37] They sold out last year.
[01:55:39] Yeah.
[01:55:40] And so I did another iteration with your request for the heavy.
[01:55:45] There they have the one.
[01:55:46] Actually, I think there might be some industrial heavier ones.
[01:55:50] Maybe.
[01:55:51] No, because I think that was.
[01:55:54] Then yeah, I don't know.
[01:55:55] I forget nonetheless.
[01:55:57] These are the heavy ones.
[01:55:59] Confirm, double confirm.
[01:56:01] Also, so women's stuff on there.
[01:56:03] I think I'm going to add a few things before Christmas on the store.
[01:56:09] That'd be good.
[01:56:10] So if you want to keep your eyes on that, that's a good way to support.
[01:56:15] If you want something, get something.
[01:56:17] Check them out.
[01:56:18] Also, psychological warfare.
[01:56:19] If you know what that is, I'm telling you it's an album with tracks.
[01:56:22] Jockel talking on these tracks.
[01:56:26] Basically, you listen to them when you are on the path.
[01:56:32] We'll say on the path.
[01:56:34] And you get moments of weakness.
[01:56:36] Days of weakness.
[01:56:37] You're not feeling like it.
[01:56:39] You know how you always talk about it.
[01:56:41] It doesn't matter if you feel like it or not.
[01:56:42] You just do it.
[01:56:43] Yeah.
[01:56:44] Okay.
[01:56:45] And I respect that.
[01:56:46] And that's where we all want to be.
[01:56:48] We all want to be there.
[01:56:51] But for some of us, it's not like that.
[01:56:55] You're a separate set of the time.
[01:56:56] Sometimes when you really don't feel like it.
[01:56:58] Sometimes when I really don't feel like it.
[01:57:01] I just don't do it, man.
[01:57:03] Sometimes they're going to be honest.
[01:57:05] We'll put on psychological warfare and you'll do it.
[01:57:07] Yes.
[01:57:08] It's like a spot.
[01:57:10] You know, especially a spot.
[01:57:11] This is where it's like a no brainer.
[01:57:14] Really easy.
[01:57:16] When you're like contemplating.
[01:57:18] I could just do this tomorrow, right?
[01:57:21] And you start making deals with yourself.
[01:57:22] You ever do that?
[01:57:23] No deals with myself.
[01:57:25] No deals with the weak part of it.
[01:57:26] It's like you don't.
[01:57:27] It's a straight up.
[01:57:29] Jockel.
[01:57:30] No deals.
[01:57:31] Jockel.
[01:57:32] Like I don't feel like it.
[01:57:33] I feel like it.
[01:57:34] Whatever.
[01:57:35] That makes me angry.
[01:57:37] I get pissed at myself.
[01:57:39] If I start leaning towards.
[01:57:41] Like, maybe I just want to do anything.
[01:57:43] No, oh, really.
[01:57:44] Really.
[01:57:45] How is that?
[01:57:46] That's how.
[01:57:47] Okay.
[01:57:47] Cool.
[01:57:48] Wanna go smash?
[01:57:49] You know, it's real funny.
[01:57:50] I would.
[01:57:51] That doesn't surprise.
[01:57:52] I'm not going to be like, I'm going to be like,
[01:57:55] I'm going to be like, I don't know if we can kind of do that.
[01:57:58] Then you get this sort of look.
[01:58:00] This kind of way about you kind of like.
[01:58:02] So wait.
[01:58:02] That's how it's.
[01:58:03] I'm going to be going on vacation.
[01:58:05] And he's going to be gone for a couple weeks.
[01:58:08] And I've been real busy with all kinds of stuff.
[01:58:11] And we were talking about if we'd be able to actually get all these podcasts done.
[01:58:17] And I didn't think we could do it.
[01:58:20] And so I said, hey, I got you know, we're just going to have to take, you know, no, no podcast for a few weeks.
[01:58:24] And then then I said, actually, like a day went by.
[01:58:29] And I said, I said, I said, echo a text that said, actually, we're going to do it.
[01:58:33] Yeah.
[01:58:34] And we're going to record all the podcasts.
[01:58:35] I'm going to prep for them all.
[01:58:36] We're going to have an all-nighter.
[01:58:38] And we'll just get it done.
[01:58:39] Bring some red bull and get some.
[01:58:42] Bring some joc a white tea.
[01:58:44] Yeah.
[01:58:45] Well, what was interesting about that is when you said that,
[01:58:49] you had this kind of tone of like dang, like,
[01:58:52] term it like we got to take a break.
[01:58:54] We got to take a break after two years, by the way,
[01:58:56] every single week, by the way.
[01:59:00] We got to take a break.
[01:59:01] That's what you said.
[01:59:02] Yeah.
[01:59:03] And right when I was like, cool, I dig it.
[01:59:06] No, I mean, I'm not saying good.
[01:59:08] I'm saying cool.
[01:59:09] I totally understand.
[01:59:10] And you know what that makes sense.
[01:59:12] HBO.
[01:59:14] Big company.
[01:59:16] Takes huge breaks.
[01:59:18] Everybody takes huge breaks.
[01:59:19] Everybody takes huge breaks.
[01:59:20] Yeah.
[01:59:21] A pair.
[01:59:22] And you're over here two years in no breaks, no breaks, no matter what.
[01:59:27] Okay.
[01:59:28] So they'll come a time when we are forced to for some reason.
[01:59:30] Yeah.
[01:59:31] That's kind of part of the point.
[01:59:32] Right?
[01:59:33] So I'm like cool.
[01:59:34] I dig it.
[01:59:35] I totally understand.
[01:59:36] Jocco.
[01:59:37] And when I said that, that's one of your face kind of shifted,
[01:59:40] like kind of you went into your own world.
[01:59:43] Like did I just say that?
[01:59:44] Like it's almost like you sort of got mad.
[01:59:46] Russel.
[01:59:47] I was like, oh, we're not taking a break.
[01:59:49] I know Jocco's gonna come back.
[01:59:53] Nonetheless, and I'm sure that'll, okay.
[01:59:55] So I dig it.
[01:59:56] But back to psychological warfare.
[01:59:59] If you need a spot or even want a spot with those times that you're like,
[02:00:09] maybe I'll skip the work.
[02:00:10] Maybe I'll slip in the dive.
[02:00:11] I mean, just listen to any track.
[02:00:13] And the track is labeled, you know, where.
[02:00:15] If you can skip on the diet, it's like sugar coated like weight.
[02:00:19] What is it?
[02:00:20] Sugar coated like.
[02:00:21] But it's something something's sugar coated like sugar coated like.
[02:00:23] It's just sugar coated like.
[02:00:24] Yeah.
[02:00:25] So you listen to that.
[02:00:26] And then what's good is it's not some inspirational.
[02:00:29] And you can do it.
[02:00:30] It's not that it's like, it's pragmatic.
[02:00:32] I hear to do that.
[02:00:33] Well, here's the thing though.
[02:00:34] You, but just by nature, you're tone of voice kind of kind of like,
[02:00:38] by happens, stands inserts that concept in it.
[02:00:42] So it's kind of a double, double thing.
[02:00:44] It turns out, but primarily it's just a pragmatic thing.
[02:00:48] Think about think about this.
[02:00:50] Logical stuff.
[02:00:52] And then at the end of the track, you kind of conclude that,
[02:00:54] Oh yeah.
[02:00:55] It's going to get after it.
[02:00:56] Yeah, exactly right.
[02:00:57] That's what psychological warfare is.
[02:00:59] It is on iTunes.
[02:01:01] Amazon music.
[02:01:02] Google play.
[02:01:03] Whatever you can get,
[02:01:04] and be three.

[02:01:12] if you get Jocquite T, that will be solved immediately.
[02:01:14] And your deadlift will then be 8,000 pounds,
[02:01:17] including Jordan B. Peterson, who can now deadlift 8,000 pounds.
[02:01:20] He broke through his 7,000 pounds.

[02:02:01] A good amount.
[02:02:02] So they're in there.
[02:02:03] There's also new forward and some new color pictures.
[02:02:06] Color pictures.
[02:02:07] Interesting.
[02:02:08] Yeah.
[02:02:09] Because I don't like color pictures.
[02:02:10] I said no.
[02:02:11] That caught on me.
[02:02:12] They said, well, this is more premium.
[02:02:13] I said, no, black and white is premium.
[02:02:16] It's a gift.
[02:02:18] So anyways, if you want to see what I look like in color, then you can get the book.
[02:02:23] But to offset that, I said, okay, fine.
[02:02:26] You want to put color pictures in there.
[02:02:27] Make the whole book black.
[02:02:28] So that's what they did.
[02:02:29] Make the whole book black.
[02:02:31] And that was that.
[02:02:33] And speaking of black also.
[02:02:35] The disponibles freedom field manual is available.
[02:02:39] And I told you about that tagline that the publisher wanted to have like,
[02:02:46] the, this book is a superb gift for holiday season.
[02:02:49] And I told them no.
[02:02:52] The tagline is there's no better gift than discipline.
[02:02:57] That's the truth.
[02:02:58] You know, it's actually true.
[02:03:00] If you could give someone the gift of discipline, would you not be giving them the best gift in life?
[02:03:04] Yes.
[02:03:05] Now you can actually give them the gift of discipline equals freedom field manual.
[02:03:08] So you can do that.
[02:03:09] Now this is important because people keep asking me the field manual.
[02:03:14] Audio version.
[02:03:15] Dispening goes for you and field manual is it is also on iTunes.
[02:03:19] Amazon use a Google play other MP3 platforms.
[02:03:22] It's available right now.
[02:03:23] It is not on audible.
[02:03:25] Audible is not with tracks.
[02:03:27] We wanted an album with tracks.
[02:03:29] So why we did it this way.
