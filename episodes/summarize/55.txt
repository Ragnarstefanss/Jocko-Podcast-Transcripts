As opposed to like, you know, you know, some like in training your training with me, you're like, okay, I'm going to it's essentially letting someone get in into a good position on you. But some guys are, as far as decision-making goes, some guys are crazy, you know, where like how you said like if they're like on drugs, or this guy in this case, if you said in the middle of the road acting like, boy, isn't the hood guy? You're like, dang, I can't get like a good like and when you you're like, okay, I'm going to get in my position and he just adjust like immediately. And that's what you see guys like in UFC though, the front of the middle of the ring, you know, because they're like controlling or like a BGPN would all be if he's coaching somebody would be like, be first B first B first Anyway, um, and also shrimp tex, so a lot of people, you know how people, they'll say, hey, a lot of people been asking me when you know like, uh, a lot of people have been asking me. But it's, you know, someone's like, like if you're walking on the sidewalk and you get to your way, that's, you know, it's kind of different or whatever, but avoiding the situation. You know, when like, if this guy, and like I'm in the street and you're in the car, that's, I don't know that seems real obvious. You know, do something to get you start shaving a little bit of money because in the long run, what you're going to get from these two things from fitness and from jiu-jitsu are going to be going to have so much value in your life. And you can tell like when you roll against a guy and we talk about this before when you roll against a guy and even if he's not like his game isn't aggressive, but Right when you lock up with him, you can tell he's just like just in the correct position. Yeah, like I'm going to go out and, and I'm looking for, I'm going to look for the guy, but then like, what's the goal? Just saying, you know, like there is going to be some ripples in the, you know, especially when you first make that transition. This is what you got to be ready for because I've heard this way who's going to say that the corporate you got to the corporate say, look, you know, we got the guys in the front lines. Like he's obviously off, you know, like he's not a decision-maker kind of thing. yeah, you got to know if you don't know why you're doing something, then what are you going to do when you hit an obstacle? Do you think that like, oh, you know, people will be like, this is my Do you think that falls within this like, you know, like reason, purpose and all this stuff? And I just kind of looked at him and sort of did the, you know, into the semi, not a full on fight stance, but I turned, you know, like a quarter turn and just looked at him. It's almost like, I mean, maybe I'm wrong here, but it's almost like you can't read, like, what's the thing? And the guy, like, he was like, I don't know. Jocco's version of the, you know, those days where you got to talk yourself into doing the workout or not eating, you know, whole thing or Oreos or whatever. You're like, oh, you know, I don't feel like cooking. And in this case, I don't know, you know, this guy, you knocked out a weird homeless guy in the middle of the road and find your family. Like right from the time that guy says go or, you know, when it goes down in the street, whatever. And you just do so ambiguous as far as like a, like an art and there's like this big spectrum You're going to aggressively like, hey, you know what? Guys end up feeling alone and they're out there and they're like, and the other thing is they feel like people don't understand me. If you have questions about that, or if you have like a corporate, you're going to bring 10 people, 12 people, 20 people from your company. And that's going to make you execute well because you know where you're going.
