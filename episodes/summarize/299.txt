It's the circuit of that thing and it's The benefits are the things that keep that are kind of nice and especially if you don't know If other people are settling down getting married your friends getting real jobs at see more real on paper and those things are I didn't want to be like everybody else that's the thing I always remember my head I didn't want to be like a lot of people I wanted to manage my embassy only thing I had was Everything else in my life since my birth it felt like it was like a sentence like this is who you are you are somebody who You know, you're not you're not going to be in a home where you were really loved you're not You know things like that. I'm just trying to share some of you know share what Some of that was like from me, but um Yeah, I think it was Tyler it's like uh You felt like you weren't part of a plan like nobody planned or if you were it was a plan that was Destined to fail, you know what I'm saying it so then that almost makes you feel like What's going on if my commander and chief here my mother or something Set me up in this plan that doesn't seem like it has Statistically this doesn't seem super smart. so I always felt like if you were laughing you couldn't dislike me at a laugh at the same moment Like at that moment like it was down to that moment like when you were done laughing I didn't know what you thought of me, you know, and it was kind of scary because I think I didn't think much of myself and so the only Way I had to feel about myself from moments a moment was how other people felt about you know if I'm real honest and and then also you're out there you have you're able to establish brief relationships You know one night stands you know a little bit of sex here and there a little bit of touch and jerking off next to someone not even sex Sometimes or even just jerking off by yourself and wishing somebody was there You know, which is really one I mean that was that was probably two out of three Like only one of those sounded like a relationship You know what's out of like perversion and you're the one who just sounded lovely so I don't know worse We're gonna be there just doing what we're doing So we appreciate that if you can't afford that and you still want to be a supporter You can email assistance at jacca owner ground calm that way you can get You can get it to the underground Which is where you want to be we got a YouTube channel too by the way Struc verified by the way For the video version of this podcast you want to see what the feel looks like if you don't know I think a lot of us already know, but if you don't know phone you can see that video podcast is increasingly becoming kind of the way You know to watch listen to the podcast. I mean it was really just like a damn newborn like a strong newborn You know I'm saying one that fucking elbow crawls out You know with a can of freaking go in a car I know I said they kind of baby that beats mom Okay, like this thing was ready to go this thing was ten months in the this thing was I go to make Um, and then COVID hits and then COVID hit so then you have all this down time and I don't know if I always felt like that as a kid I felt like more like every day was a battle, you know where is now I'm like man every there's there's a lot of good stuff out there something maybe tropical you know it was some ocean sounds in the back You know maybe get that Viet and me's got to go by drinking that cranberry on the skateboard You know I would get it kind of you know maybe slightly urban you know maybe somebody playing you know And so when that world gets tough and you don't know anything else man that that struggled that is your Vietnam Yeah, and that's where people end up whether it's you know some girl kissing on you when you're Whatever I'm gonna do well the tough part was other people were walked like the bigger bull with like my brother and his friends The bus would pick them up first and so then it would come and get me and so that's when she would pick me up And it was like my first girlfriend And people will approach or whatever I think sometimes they can like miss represent who you are They're like oh, yeah, maybe like they feel like they know you got a podcast all this stuff Yeah, when I was like what once I got a like 12 or 13 I kind of I was like I mean it was kind of embarrassing you know having such an older time my dad would fall he'd be a sleep at like a vent he would fall asleep at the Carpool when he'd come pick us up he'd fall asleep You know I would like to meet him in you know like He was some people's Like I did reach some reality tell was when I was younger you know for a couple years on TV so So laughter was it really for me that was my biceps, you know It seems like to uh there's an opportunity for someone that's in your position where you have this kind of like insecurity and kind of a little bit of a paranoia against the world To go down the path of like drug and alcohol abuse and we all know where that path ends up if we stay on it The the roots come up through them just like kneecaps just like you know You got a thousand long leg at man buried right there under the sidewalk, you know and some of them's you know So I was always worried about I think what people were thinking of me and I felt like people didn't like me I felt like I think because sometimes I don't know if I was just such an uncomfortable kid sometimes that I Needed laughter But yeah, I should sometimes I don't know what I'm talking about you know, but he's like so open with that and I don't mean Open like he's like making this huge effort to be open you know yeah, my company hard work doesn't necessarily mean you get promoted I'm like that's true everywhere hard work doesn't necessarily like you can't just expect I'm just gonna work hard work hard work hard and that then things are just gonna happen If that if it was I hate to say if it was that easy and a lot more people do it not everyone do hard work He always is trying to show me that people care about me, you know because I think for so long I didn't feel like anybody did you know when I was real real young and I'm not complaining and you know I'm not complaining about it.
