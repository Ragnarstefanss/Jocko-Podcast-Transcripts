00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jocco podcast number 204 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000
By virtue of the authority vested in me as president of the United States and as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States,

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have today awarded the Presidential Unit citation for extraordinary heroism to the studies and observations group military assistance command.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The studies in observation group is cited for extraordinary heroism, great combat achievement and unwavering fidelity while executing unheralded top secret missions deep behind enemy lines across southeast Asia.

5
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Incorporating volunteers from all branches of the armed forces and especially US Army Special Forces,

6
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the dogs ground air and sea units fought efficiently denied actions which contributed immeasurably to the American war effort in Vietnam.

7
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Mac Vesog reconnaissance teams composed of special forces soldiers and indigenous personnel penetrated the enemy's most dangerous redouts in the jungle lay ocean wilderness and the sanctuaries of eastern Cambodia.

8
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:43.000
pursued by human trackers and even blood hounds. These small teams outmaneuvered out fought and outran their numerically superior foe to uncover key enemy facilities rescue down pilots, plant wire traps, mines and electronic sensors capture valuable enemy prisoners ambush convoys,

9
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000
discover and assess targets for B-52 strikes and flick casualties all out of proportion to their own losses.

10
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When enemy countermeasures became dangerously effective, saw operators innovated their own counters from high altitude parachuting and unusual explosive devices to tactics as old as the French and Indian war.

11
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Fighting alongside their modern yard, Chinese known Cambodian and Vietnamese allies special forces led hatchet forces companies and platoons staged daring raids against key enemy facilities in Lousen Cambodia over ran major munitions and supplies stockpiles and blocked enemy highways to choke off the flow of supplies to South Vietnam.

12
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Sogs cross border operations proved an effective economy force compelling the Vietnamese the North Vietnamese army to divert 50,000 soldiers to rear airy security details from far from the battlefields of South Vietnam.

13
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Supporting these hazardous missions were Sogs' own US and South Vietnamese Air Force transport and helicopter squadrons along with US Air Force forward air controllers and helicopter units of the US Army and US Marine Corps.

14
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000
These courageous aviators often flew through heavy fire to extract Sog operators from seemingly hopeless situations saving lives by selflessly risking their own.

15
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Sogs' Vietnamese naval surface forces instructed and advised by US Navy SEALs boldly rated North Vietnam's coast and won surface victories against the North Vietnamese Navy while indigenous agent teams penetrated the very heartland of North Vietnam.

16
00:03:41.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Despite casualties that sometimes became universal Sogs operators never wavered but fought throughout the war with the same flare, fidelity and interpetity that distinguished Sog from its beginning.

17
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Sogs' factories and observation groups combat prowess, martial skills and un-ignalaged sacrifices saved many American lives and provide a pair of gun for America's future special operations forces.

18
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Signed President of the United States George Walker Bush.

19
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And that is the Presidential Unit Citation presented for those that served in Mac Vee Saga, the Studies and Observation Group in Vietnam.

20
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And for those of you that don't know what the Presidential Unit Citation is, it's an award that is giving to whole units.

21
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Who, and this is the way they describe it, I quote, display gallantry determination and to spread a core that sets them apart from other units.

22
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And you have heard about Sog on this podcast before. First from John Striker Meyer, otherwise known as Tilt. And he was on podcast 1801 and 182 and then from his comrade in arms, the late Great Hero Doug the Frenchman, L'Aterno.

23
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And it is an honor for us tonight to have another Sog warrior here. Henry Dick Thompson, codenamed Dynamite and later known as the Terminator, who served as a Sog 11 and as a 10 and then continued on with 21 years in the Army, eventually retiring and having a whole another career.

24
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:09.000
As a leadership consultant, author and speaker, Mr. Thompson. And I know I should probably say Dr. Thompson, because I know you got your PhD as well.

25
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
If that in case everything else was enough, sir, welcome to the program. Thank you for coming on.

26
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Thank you for having me. Looking forward to it. So, let's start at the beginning. Where'd you grow up?

27
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And South Carolina, a little town called Wallhalla, not far from Climpson University. And what year were you born?

28
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
1947. 1947. So you kind of grew up in the 50s?

29
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah, pretty much. And then were you in a military family or anything like that?

30
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:55.000
My father, yeah, my father was a World War II in Korea. My mother had five brothers, all World War II when it was killed.

31
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So I was around it, you know, like from the start, because a family was together a lot.

32
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So I had a lot of discussion, you know, about the war and things that were going on.

33
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I was always asking questions and how do you do this and how do you do that and how do you organize? So I was interested, you know, right from the beginning.

34
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And your dad was in World War II and Korea. What was his job in the military? What branch was he?

35
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He was infantry. So, and he did work with the Rangers for a while and one more to.

36
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And so would you hear him? Would he debrief you on the types of operations that he did in World War II in Korea? Some of it. He didn't talk a whole lot about exactly what he did, but he would talk in general about what was going on, about the kinds of operations and things.

37
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So what theater did you fight in?

38
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
He was in Germany, mostly the time in that area.

39
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And how long was he in the army for?

40
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Army was about four years and then he got out and then when Korea came along, then they called it back in.

41
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And that's really where I started to hear about it because I was old enough by then to hear people talk about Korea and about the war.

42
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And he would write letters on and talk about how deep the mud was or how cold it was and things like that.

43
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So I was hearing about the war, you know, first hand and then.

44
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And were you thinking, I'm going in the military?

45
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I was probably four or five when I started thinking about that.

46
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And interestingly enough, I did found find my old log book because I also got interested in the and the Rangers.

47
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I wanted to be a Ranger when I went in.

48
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So I found a log book that I created when, you know, I was about nine or so when I created it.

49
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I had all the members of our Ranger Company listed, which was primarily my cousins.

50
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But, you know, we had to murder people, we had recruited in and we had the journal of things that we did.

51
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
People who got promoted.

52
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
People who I court martial.

53
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So are were you guys doing night raids and stuff?

54
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We spent a lot of time in the woods.

55
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I grew up in the woods.

56
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You know, when I was five years old when I get a chance I'd go off in the woods by myself.

57
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I go play track animals.

58
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I'd listen to the sounds.

59
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I'd learn how to move by the time I was six.

60
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I had an army putt in it and I would take up on top of the hill and the woods put it up.

61
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Sleep up there by myself.

62
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
That night takes some eggs and stuff with me.

63
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I'd build a little fire, you know, cook.

64
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
As I got a little older and I had my BB gun.

65
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I'd take out some birds, roast them over the fire.

66
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So doing things like that that I thought Rangers did.

67
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
You were the six year old Ranger company commander getting after it.

68
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
You know, a lot of books had general tops.

69
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yeah.

70
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That works.

71
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And then what about high school did you play sports football and track?

72
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
How I was your athletic capability.

73
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I was better than average on the team.

74
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I wasn't you know, college material.

75
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But you know, because I was relatively small.

76
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But I could hit really hard.

77
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
My senior year that you've been moving me from running back to defensive end,

78
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
which I was on a line that weighed over 200 pounds and I was 140.

79
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You didn't want to come around my end.

80
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
My other skill was, you know, it was very fast.

81
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And when the quarterback had dropped back and seen me in his face, because I could get there really quickly.

82
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And then, so when you graduated high school, did you, did you know you were going to college or what was your place?

83
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Yeah.

84
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I started college and after about a year and a half, you know, Vietnam was going hot and heavy.

85
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You saw I don't, the news every night.

86
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, you're a graduate high school?

87
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Yeah, I was 65.

88
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Okay. So yeah, I, from what I can tell, because I wasn't alive then, but from what I can tell,

89
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
the, the battle the I drank value was in 1965 and that was kind of where the real,

90
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
hey, we're, we're in combat all the time now.

91
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It seems to have, that seems to be the pivot point.

92
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
That's noticeable when you look at it historically.

93
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Well, that was, that was when I think we discovered the North Vietnamese had a real army.

94
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And they were very good much better than anybody thought at the time.

95
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And over the next few years, that mean you, you could place them probably in the top four in the world in terms of armies.

96
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Plus, we were fighting in their backyard.

97
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
They knew the terrain.

98
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
They knew how to operate there.

99
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
They didn't stop.

100
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
They just keep coming.

101
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Their biggest disadvantage was they didn't have the technology that we did.

102
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
They, they have air superiority and it's just a lot of things they didn't have that held them back or it would have been much worse than it was.

103
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So it's 1965 is, that's when you said you graduated high school.

104
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And when you graduated high school, you go to college.

105
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Where'd you go to college?

106
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
University, South Carolina.

107
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And then you said it was like a year and a half that you, what, what'd you end up doing?

108
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Well, I, I made a decision that what I wanted to do is take a break from school.

109
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Because we had no one was going on. I felt an obligation to go do something, do my part.

110
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And actually was all my way to the Marine recruiter because that's who you saw on TV every night.

111
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But stopped by the Army recruiter who was next to or just to see what they had to offer.

112
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So I went with the Army and I knew that would give me a chance to do the Rangers.

113
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If I decided that's what I wanted to do.

114
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But by then I, I was also a chemist about 13 developed the passion for chemistry.

115
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So in addition to all the outdoor stuff, you know, I was, I set up my own laboratory in the barn.

116
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I spent all my money on chemicals and I know you like this, but back in the day.

117
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You could, you could go into a pharmacy and buy all kinds of things.

118
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I mean, you could buy, you know, nitric acid, I mean just unbelievable, chemical, you know, you could buy.

119
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Particularly if you got your mother designed for you and say, yeah, it's okay to let him have that stuff.

120
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I would stock my, my lab with it and do all kinds of experiments.

121
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I, I was getting close maybe to a successful brain exchange between birds and frogs.

122
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I could get it in there. I just couldn't get them, you know, to start breathing again afterwards.

123
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So I have a lot of that sounds close.

124
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Yeah. So anyway, so were you studying chemistry in college?

125
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yes.

126
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yeah, I went to school on a chemistry scholarship. The intent was to be, you know, got a doctor and chemistry and be a researcher.

127
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
But then I decided to take the break.

128
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Do three years in the army and then come back and finish the degree.

129
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So it's so is it 1967 now when in 1967?

130
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So it's 1967. How strong would the sentiments in America against the war in 1967?

131
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Very strong. So that was already there.

132
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Yeah.

133
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
What about South Carolina?

134
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Not as much as some of the other parts of the country, you know, but it was still there.

135
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It wasn't something that everyone thought we should be doing.

136
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Mm-hmm.

137
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And what about your dad who had seen combat in World War II and in Korea?

138
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
How do he feel about going in?

139
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
He supported it.

140
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
My mother didn't.

141
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You know, she wanted to finish his school.

142
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I was like, you know, I'm just taking three year break.

143
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'll come back and finish the doctor and everything will be fine.

144
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
She said, no, you want to. I'll be back.

145
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Unfortunately, when I got in, they started talking about, man, you got to go to the Airborne School.

146
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
You need to be airborne.

147
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And they said, you need to go to the SC.

148
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Yeah, you need to be on officer.

149
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So what point? So you go to boot camp.

150
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And is it boot camp where they're like, look, and you go, hey, we need airborne soldiers.

151
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yeah.

152
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And was that a pretty easy pathway to get to?

153
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Yes. I mean, they ask you, gay one when you go into induction center.

154
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
You want balls here to be airborne.

155
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
My response was, no.

156
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's not what I'm here for.

157
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But then once I got into boot camp, I think that stuff up.

158
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Did you still, so when you were, when you went in, what was the predominant part of your brain that was functioning?

159
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Was it the, hey, I'm going to do three years serve my country and looked for a job that will be similar to being a chemist?

160
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Or was the primary part of your brain that was functioning was the, I wanted to be a ranger and go get after it.

161
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
It was when I first entered first couple of days.

162
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
It was, you know, three years I'm out, go back to school, be a chemist.

163
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I guess it was maybe the first morning we were in the barracks.

164
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And, you know, about 334 clock, the lights come on.

165
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Somebody starts yelling and screaming and hollowing to get out of the, out of bed, fall in, you know, getting formation in front of the blocks.

166
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And then I hear, you know, when double blocks, I hear them start crashing onto the floor.

167
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And I jump out and I look and here's this guy smaller than me.

168
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
There's a big, you know, smokey day bare head on a ranger tab.

169
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That's going to wow.

170
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And everybody there jumped one night guy said to do something.

171
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And I said, okay, I need to start rethinking here.

172
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
There's got to be something innate in men.

173
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
To, to, that's just, that's just what happens.

174
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You see that and you go, yes, I'm in for that.

175
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Yeah, I mean, this guy was impressive.

176
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And, you know, that brought back all the ranger stuff.

177
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And it started over by the chemistry, you know, so then we get out,

178
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
we run the firing range, you know, I'm, I wasn't expert marksman before ever, you know, went in.

179
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So, you know, I'd max out the marksman's ship.

180
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And I was in, you know, good physical condition.

181
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So, every, every thing they were doing, I could do.

182
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And I, I learned it really fast.

183
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
One night, I was on, CQ, duty.

184
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I had to work in the Ordley room with the person who was there on night.

185
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And I saw this book, laying on the table.

186
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I was FM-20T-100, Trill and Sarah Monnys.

187
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And I picked it up and I started looking at it and I thought,

188
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
this tells you everything about, you know, right face, left face,

189
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
when to call the command, all the, I said it's all written out right here.

190
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I mean, if I'd had this book, like, a couple weeks.

191
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So, I read the book, night, you know, I'd probably pretty fast.

192
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
The next day, I could see the mistakes, the drill sergeants are making.

193
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And I, I made the mistake one time. I'll point it out.

194
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So, you know, I get the work on my tricep, some packs a little bit.

195
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And I pushed, pushed for it, got in a little bit closer to China.

196
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
But, I found it, this is what I'll written down.

197
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
He gave me access to it, I'll learn it.

198
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And so, I was the, putting charge of my punten,

199
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
as a punten guide, because, you know, physically mentally everything I was doing great.

200
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.40
So I had a good time.

201
00:19:34.40 --> 00:19:36.68
And then you've all, was it,

202
00:19:36.68 --> 00:19:39.24
did you have a job designated when you went in?

203
00:19:39.24 --> 00:19:41.68
Were you going to be infantry when you went in?

204
00:19:41.68 --> 00:19:43.48
I was going to the chemical corps.

205
00:19:43.48 --> 00:19:47.24
So the chemistry brain was legitimately winning when you went in.

206
00:19:47.24 --> 00:19:49.12
That was for a few days.

207
00:19:49.12 --> 00:19:54.12
And then did you change your specialty to infantry?

208
00:19:54.12 --> 00:19:54.72
Yeah.

209
00:19:54.72 --> 00:19:57.40
You walked in and said, yeah, hey, I know I showed up to be a chemist,

210
00:19:57.40 --> 00:20:00.40
but I want to carry a machine gun.

211
00:20:00.40 --> 00:20:03.44
Maybe how hard was it to do that?

212
00:20:03.44 --> 00:20:04.44
Not hard at all.

213
00:20:04.44 --> 00:20:06.04
Because I was so fired up.

214
00:20:06.04 --> 00:20:08.44
I had a lot of the things we were doing.

215
00:20:08.44 --> 00:20:10.36
And I figured, I could do this for three years.

216
00:20:10.36 --> 00:20:13.48
I could still go back and do a chemist if I want to.

217
00:20:13.48 --> 00:20:14.64
But they let you change.

218
00:20:14.64 --> 00:20:16.92
They said, OK, cool.

219
00:20:16.92 --> 00:20:18.48
If you want to change the infantry,

220
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:20.32
during that time, there was no problem.

221
00:20:20.32 --> 00:20:21.36
No problem.

222
00:20:21.36 --> 00:20:23.32
Anybody that would volunteer for that?

223
00:20:23.32 --> 00:20:25.000
I mean, you got it right away.

224
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.44
And then next up, how did you volunteer for airborne school?

225
00:20:27.44 --> 00:20:29.64
Same thing?

226
00:20:29.64 --> 00:20:30.64
Yeah.

227
00:20:30.64 --> 00:20:34.52
I mean, I just had an opportunity to volunteer.

228
00:20:34.52 --> 00:20:37.56
Well, after boot camp, you'd go to my case,

229
00:20:37.56 --> 00:20:39.60
and went to advanced infantry training.

230
00:20:39.60 --> 00:20:40.60
Yeah, I saw.

231
00:20:40.60 --> 00:20:44.28
So in there, you're volunteering for different things.

232
00:20:44.28 --> 00:20:49.44
So I volunteered for OCS, I volunteered to go to Airborne School.

233
00:20:49.44 --> 00:20:51.72
So I went to OCS first.

234
00:20:51.72 --> 00:20:55.52
And they sent you to OCS even though you hadn't completed college.

235
00:20:55.52 --> 00:20:56.52
Yes.

236
00:20:56.52 --> 00:20:58.44
And they didn't care.

237
00:20:58.44 --> 00:20:59.44
And I did that time.

238
00:20:59.44 --> 00:21:01.20
They're like, hey, you're smart.

239
00:21:01.20 --> 00:21:03.20
Luteinets were getting kill so fast.

240
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:07.60
I mean, they couldn't produce luteinets fast enough.

241
00:21:07.60 --> 00:21:13.000
Luteinets had a life expectancy about a day and a half of the amount.

242
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.04
So that was easy to get in.

243
00:21:16.04 --> 00:21:18.04
And I did that.

244
00:21:18.04 --> 00:21:20.000
I did really well at OCS.

245
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.48
So it was easy when I said, OK, I want to go to Airborne School.

246
00:21:25.48 --> 00:21:28.80
I want to go to Special Forces.

247
00:21:28.80 --> 00:21:32.000
So you made that decision as well.

248
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.56
Now what about being going from officers to Special Forces?

249
00:21:35.56 --> 00:21:37.12
Was there any challenge in making that happen?

250
00:21:37.12 --> 00:21:38.64
Or was it still just open?

251
00:21:38.64 --> 00:21:39.64
Why open?

252
00:21:39.64 --> 00:21:40.84
I took me right in.

253
00:21:40.84 --> 00:21:43.64
Yeah, I had done well.

254
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:45.72
I got accepted to that.

255
00:21:45.72 --> 00:21:47.28
So I had to, how you had to?

256
00:21:47.28 --> 00:21:49.28
At the coast point.

257
00:21:49.28 --> 00:21:53.000
19, 20.

258
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.36
So you're 19 years old.

259
00:21:54.36 --> 00:21:55.56
You have a year and a half of college.

260
00:21:55.56 --> 00:22:01.24
You're an officer in the army going to Special Forces Airborne.

261
00:22:01.24 --> 00:22:03.60
And this is all just tracking you to go to Vietnam.

262
00:22:03.60 --> 00:22:04.60
Yeah.

263
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:05.60
And you're on that track.

264
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:07.12
But I'm going to go ahead.

265
00:22:07.12 --> 00:22:10.60
Well, let's go ahead and say when you, so Airborne School is Airborne School.

266
00:22:10.60 --> 00:22:11.60
I went to Airborne School.

267
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:15.60
I was lucky enough to have been in the Navy when we still went to Fort Benning, George, and

268
00:22:15.60 --> 00:22:17.08
Airborne School.

269
00:22:17.08 --> 00:22:18.80
But what about Special Forces School?

270
00:22:18.80 --> 00:22:22.60
As you were going through that, what was your impression of what was going on?

271
00:22:22.60 --> 00:22:27.28
What was the instruction like, how well was that preparing you from your perspective for

272
00:22:27.28 --> 00:22:30.36
what were you going to be doing in Vietnam?

273
00:22:30.36 --> 00:22:34.72
I think it did a, it didn't prepare me for a song necessarily.

274
00:22:34.72 --> 00:22:38.76
It gave me a lot of the basics.

275
00:22:38.76 --> 00:22:45.16
Special Forces is not just about going in and conducting a raid or something like that.

276
00:22:45.16 --> 00:22:47.60
It's really good about going in and working with the people.

277
00:22:47.60 --> 00:22:54.60
We did a lot of training on insurgency, how governments are overthrown, different things

278
00:22:54.60 --> 00:22:55.60
like that.

279
00:22:55.60 --> 00:22:59.92
So, particularly since I was an officer, I was on the Offsuit track.

280
00:22:59.92 --> 00:23:05.32
So, we were doing a lot of the bigger picture.

281
00:23:05.32 --> 00:23:12.80
Staff plus, officers get trained in all of the primary school sets of Special Forces,

282
00:23:12.80 --> 00:23:19.64
whereas if you're enlisted coming out of the qualification training, you go to be a weapon

283
00:23:19.64 --> 00:23:22.48
specialist, there to be a medic or whatever.

284
00:23:22.48 --> 00:23:24.88
You go into a special area.

285
00:23:24.88 --> 00:23:28.48
Officers have to be trained in all of them so that you understand what the people are talking

286
00:23:28.48 --> 00:23:30.48
about if you're going to lead them.

287
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:33.48
So, I enjoyed that.

288
00:23:33.48 --> 00:23:37.12
Did well in it, volunteered for Ranger School.

289
00:23:37.12 --> 00:23:38.48
Then you went to Raiders School after?

290
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:40.36
Went to Raiders School after.

291
00:23:40.36 --> 00:23:44.40
So, a lot of harassment.

292
00:23:44.40 --> 00:23:49.52
My Ranger buddy and I, we'd been together forever.

293
00:23:49.52 --> 00:23:52.28
So we go there and was that Bob?

294
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:53.48
Yeah, that was Bob.

295
00:23:53.48 --> 00:24:00.88
And you have to go knock on the door to get in to report in to Ranger School and you can't

296
00:24:00.88 --> 00:24:02.68
knock on the door hard enough.

297
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:06.72
So, Bob and I got back and ran into it and just knocked it off the hinge.

298
00:24:06.72 --> 00:24:14.76
Then then reported in, you know, the instructor that's there, he looked at us, he looked

299
00:24:14.76 --> 00:24:19.04
down to paper and he told the other guy that was with him.

300
00:24:19.04 --> 00:24:22.04
He said, we've got two snake eaters here.

301
00:24:22.04 --> 00:24:26.88
We're going to have to keep an eye on him to make sure they don't crap into street out

302
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:27.88
there.

303
00:24:27.88 --> 00:24:34.000
So, you know, it went downhill from there because then it became Ranger School, kind of

304
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.68
they became a tug of war between S.L.F. and the Rangers.

305
00:24:39.68 --> 00:24:44.52
So, every time you did something, if they dropped you for pushups, then you had to do one

306
00:24:44.52 --> 00:24:46.36
more for the big Ranger in the sky.

307
00:24:46.36 --> 00:24:50.12
So, Bob and I would do for the big Ranger in the sky.

308
00:24:50.12 --> 00:24:51.56
And two for the big S.F.

309
00:24:51.56 --> 00:24:53.28
Trooper, it looked so worth the big Ranger.

310
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:55.56
And they'd put it back down again.

311
00:24:55.56 --> 00:24:59.76
So, you know, we tried to have as much fun in Ranger Schools.

312
00:24:59.76 --> 00:25:02.20
We could, you know, because it was tough.

313
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:07.28
And being able to put a lower humor into it as you went along.

314
00:25:07.28 --> 00:25:11.20
Now, was Ranger School in terms of preparation for what you're going to be doing in

315
00:25:11.20 --> 00:25:12.20
S.L.F.

316
00:25:12.20 --> 00:25:13.20
Yeah, of course.

317
00:25:13.20 --> 00:25:14.20
Yes.

318
00:25:14.20 --> 00:25:16.20
Because now you're doing light infantry.

319
00:25:16.20 --> 00:25:26.64
Well, it's really infantry, but it's put trolling operations, raid ambushes, you know,

320
00:25:26.64 --> 00:25:29.20
those kinds of things that we're doing in S.L.F.

321
00:25:29.20 --> 00:25:35.40
You know, when I first got to S.L.F.G when I went in with my group, everybody did, I arrived

322
00:25:35.40 --> 00:25:40.56
with went to what they called the 1-0 School, the S.L.F.G team leader school.

323
00:25:40.56 --> 00:25:42.52
And I'm standing there and everybody else is walking away.

324
00:25:42.52 --> 00:25:44.12
And it's what about me.

325
00:25:44.12 --> 00:25:47.72
And you don't need to go to 1-0 School, you're a Ranger.

326
00:25:47.72 --> 00:25:49.48
You're going to a team.

327
00:25:49.48 --> 00:25:51.52
So tomorrow you'll be on a team.

328
00:25:51.52 --> 00:25:56.12
So, what point did you hear about S.L.F.G?

329
00:25:56.12 --> 00:25:57.12
You heard rumors?

330
00:25:57.12 --> 00:26:01.04
You know, when you at S.L.F. at Fort Bragg, everyone wants to want on somebody who

331
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:05.48
would mention the term S.L.F.G.G, and you'd say, what's that?

332
00:26:05.48 --> 00:26:07.08
How did they get home in the stop-seek?

333
00:26:07.08 --> 00:26:14.32
Nobody can tell you what it is, but they really do some really cool missions.

334
00:26:14.32 --> 00:26:19.92
I mean, that's the elite, but nobody can tell you what they really do.

335
00:26:19.92 --> 00:26:24.40
So you, how much is all the schooling must have taken about two years for you to get through

336
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:26.40
all the schooling?

337
00:26:26.40 --> 00:26:29.92
It is year and a half at this point probably.

338
00:26:29.92 --> 00:26:30.92
Year and a half.

339
00:26:30.92 --> 00:26:36.44
And when you get done with Ranger School, you finally check into a special force of

340
00:26:36.44 --> 00:26:37.44
group.

341
00:26:37.44 --> 00:26:43.32
No, I don't really, we were in, there was a little interim gun there before Ranger School.

342
00:26:43.32 --> 00:26:46.68
So we were already assigned to an 18 to a B team.

343
00:26:46.68 --> 00:26:54.64
I was already targeted toward Africa and actually in mission preparation to deploy to Africa

344
00:26:54.64 --> 00:26:59.04
for a mission that we were going on there.

345
00:26:59.04 --> 00:27:04.16
But I had volunteered to put in the paperwork to go to Vietnam.

346
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:07.60
So right after Ranger School, that came through.

347
00:27:07.60 --> 00:27:09.88
And you went to all these schools with your friend Bob?

348
00:27:09.88 --> 00:27:10.88
Yeah.

349
00:27:10.88 --> 00:27:11.88
How did you know him?

350
00:27:11.88 --> 00:27:12.88
Where did you go?

351
00:27:12.88 --> 00:27:17.52
We met in Advanced Sanford, training right off the bat.

352
00:27:17.52 --> 00:27:20.08
So I mean, it was unreal.

353
00:27:20.08 --> 00:27:22.92
We just, every school, we had the same interest.

354
00:27:22.92 --> 00:27:26.16
So I mean, we went to every school together.

355
00:27:26.16 --> 00:27:27.16
The whole time.

356
00:27:27.16 --> 00:27:28.80
Where was he from?

357
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:29.80
California.

358
00:27:29.80 --> 00:27:30.80
Okay.

359
00:27:30.80 --> 00:27:32.32
But you guys just hit it off.

360
00:27:32.32 --> 00:27:33.32
Yeah.

361
00:27:33.32 --> 00:27:34.32
You guys were both had the same money.

362
00:27:34.32 --> 00:27:35.32
Headshot and same mindset.

363
00:27:35.32 --> 00:27:38.16
We're going to do it.

364
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:42.80
So then what, so you get your orders changed and was that hard to do?

365
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:50.36
Again, I mean, if there's a choice in the military, if there's a choice between sending

366
00:27:50.36 --> 00:27:57.20
someone to Africa, sending to Vietnam, at that time Vietnam was going to win, it always went out.

367
00:27:57.20 --> 00:28:01.60
So as long as you wanted to take the hardest jobs and do the toughest things, it was pretty

368
00:28:01.60 --> 00:28:05.16
easy to get that path opened up for yourself.

369
00:28:05.16 --> 00:28:07.88
The Army will accommodate you.

370
00:28:07.88 --> 00:28:12.60
So all right, let's head over to Vietnam.

371
00:28:12.60 --> 00:28:17.24
When you show up there, I remember tilts saying they kind of showed up in Vietnam and

372
00:28:17.24 --> 00:28:20.04
they said, hey, who wants to volunteer now for soar?

373
00:28:20.04 --> 00:28:21.04
Is that what happened to you?

374
00:28:21.04 --> 00:28:23.96
Did you already volunteer and know where you were going?

375
00:28:23.96 --> 00:28:25.76
I knew it was going to special forces.

376
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:29.60
I knew it, I'd get a special forces asana.

377
00:28:29.60 --> 00:28:35.68
And then when we got there, there was a guy who was already there working at a light

378
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:40.72
force, but he was there in the train.

379
00:28:40.72 --> 00:28:42.08
So we linked up with him.

380
00:28:42.08 --> 00:28:48.24
We went to a bar that night and he kind of updated some things that were going on.

381
00:28:48.24 --> 00:28:53.72
One of the things he said was tomorrow toward the end of the day, one of the last things

382
00:28:53.72 --> 00:28:59.08
they're going to do, is they're going to ask you if you want to volunteer for sog.

383
00:28:59.08 --> 00:29:02.56
And he said, whatever you do, don't do it.

384
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:05.56
Just tell them, no, they'll say thank you.

385
00:29:05.56 --> 00:29:10.28
And you move on to your special forces asana.

386
00:29:10.28 --> 00:29:16.12
So the next day toward the end of the day, where Bob and I are setting in office, waiting

387
00:29:16.12 --> 00:29:24.44
to go in to see Colonel Jones or whatever, and he said, what are you going to do?

388
00:29:24.44 --> 00:29:30.20
And I said, I'll make my decision, you have to make yours.

389
00:29:30.20 --> 00:29:34.12
This is not a joint decision on this thing.

390
00:29:34.12 --> 00:29:38.68
So I went in and he asked me about sog.

391
00:29:38.68 --> 00:29:40.52
Tell me just a little bit.

392
00:29:40.52 --> 00:29:45.80
And then said, if you want to do that, you have to sign a bunch of papers here.

393
00:29:45.80 --> 00:29:50.80
You volunteer for six months, basically go anywhere, do anything.

394
00:29:50.80 --> 00:29:52.80
And he said, you've got to understand, I'm saying anything.

395
00:29:52.80 --> 00:29:55.80
So, okay.

396
00:29:55.80 --> 00:29:57.80
And then you have to sign this.

397
00:29:57.80 --> 00:30:02.80
So the thing, you can't tell anybody for 20 years, what you do, stuff like that.

398
00:30:02.80 --> 00:30:07.24
So, while on tier, he sent me out the back door and brought Bob in the other door.

399
00:30:07.24 --> 00:30:11.24
I went back over to the little bar to meet up with her friend.

400
00:30:11.24 --> 00:30:15.96
And I came walking in and he said, you did it.

401
00:30:15.96 --> 00:30:18.48
I can see it on your face.

402
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:20.68
Did you or a dead man walking?

403
00:30:20.68 --> 00:30:22.96
I told you not to do that.

404
00:30:22.96 --> 00:30:25.40
And when Bob showed up, it was the same way.

405
00:30:25.40 --> 00:30:28.52
You could say, I knew he was going to do it.

406
00:30:28.52 --> 00:30:29.52
Yeah.

407
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:30.72
So now you too.

408
00:30:30.72 --> 00:30:36.92
So that was the attitude was, the casualty rate was so high in sog that when someone

409
00:30:36.92 --> 00:30:40.72
volunteered for it, it was like, do you or a dead man walking?

410
00:30:40.72 --> 00:30:46.04
I mean, the chances of survival, if you ended up on a team, if you went to, you know,

411
00:30:46.04 --> 00:30:47.56
staff position, that's a little different.

412
00:30:47.56 --> 00:30:54.08
But if you were on a team, you knew a minimum of you were going to get wounded.

413
00:30:54.08 --> 00:30:56.08
And did you, you knew that?

414
00:30:56.08 --> 00:30:59.76
Obviously, somebody, is this what the guy that was telling you don't go to soggy?

415
00:30:59.76 --> 00:31:02.08
He said, don't go to soggy because you're going to get wounded or you're going to get

416
00:31:02.08 --> 00:31:03.08
killed.

417
00:31:03.08 --> 00:31:06.68
That's getting ten most likely you're going to get killed.

418
00:31:06.68 --> 00:31:10.28
And he said, the highest casualty rate in Vietnam is there.

419
00:31:10.28 --> 00:31:12.28
Those guys don't survive.

420
00:31:12.28 --> 00:31:14.48
I'm not sure exactly what they do.

421
00:31:14.48 --> 00:31:18.28
But they don't survive.

422
00:31:18.28 --> 00:31:20.60
You got something, you got one note in the note you gave me.

423
00:31:20.60 --> 00:31:23.72
It says, it says, black birds.

424
00:31:23.72 --> 00:31:33.84
So we had to fly from no train to denang the next day because if you're going to soggy,

425
00:31:33.84 --> 00:31:37.28
you had to go to denang.

426
00:31:37.28 --> 00:31:43.80
So when we go to the airfield, they take us to a restricted area of the airfield.

427
00:31:43.80 --> 00:31:49.96
And the C-130s and 123s that came into that part of the airfield were black.

428
00:31:49.96 --> 00:31:56.36
He said, wow, that's a little different than everything else.

429
00:31:56.36 --> 00:32:01.92
And you get on the aircraft, there are no seats.

430
00:32:01.92 --> 00:32:04.52
There's seat belts on the floor.

431
00:32:04.52 --> 00:32:06.80
So the plane is good, except for the front end.

432
00:32:06.80 --> 00:32:12.16
And there's a line up there that says, do not go beyond its line, classified area.

433
00:32:12.16 --> 00:32:16.48
So something was happening in the front of those planes that we were not allowed to go

434
00:32:16.48 --> 00:32:17.48
to see.

435
00:32:17.48 --> 00:32:23.96
So we sat on the floor and we fly up there and we get all escort picks as out.

436
00:32:23.96 --> 00:32:29.68
And he says, there will be a bus here to pick you up in a few months to take you over

437
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:33.20
to CCN.

438
00:32:33.20 --> 00:32:38.000
And so this school bus, like thing shows up, that's black.

439
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.80
The windows shot out, they must have been 200 bullet holes in the bus.

440
00:32:43.80 --> 00:32:47.32
And we're looking at the bus thinking, oh, geez.

441
00:32:47.32 --> 00:32:50.28
What have we gotten into?

442
00:32:50.28 --> 00:32:54.88
The guy driving the bus, he said, we'll leave in a few minutes.

443
00:32:54.88 --> 00:32:59.48
We're picking up a team here today too.

444
00:32:59.48 --> 00:33:00.80
What happened to the bus?

445
00:33:00.80 --> 00:33:05.20
He said, well, there's a pass that we have to go through.

446
00:33:05.20 --> 00:33:07.32
And we get ambushed there sometimes.

447
00:33:07.32 --> 00:33:15.56
So the main thing for YouTube to remember is if the staff starts, you get on the floor

448
00:33:15.56 --> 00:33:19.08
of the bus and do whatever the team tells you.

449
00:33:19.08 --> 00:33:20.44
They'll take care of everything.

450
00:33:20.44 --> 00:33:22.80
You just do what they tell you if you want to live.

451
00:33:22.80 --> 00:33:26.56
I don't know what they think, man, this is not looking good.

452
00:33:26.56 --> 00:33:28.96
We might not even get there.

453
00:33:28.96 --> 00:33:29.96
But we did.

454
00:33:29.96 --> 00:33:30.96
And we got there.

455
00:33:30.96 --> 00:33:33.96
What was the, did you guys pick up a team?

456
00:33:33.96 --> 00:33:40.000
No, when we first got there, it was late afternoon.

457
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.52
So they'll sign us to a bunk and told us that we would get brief the next morning on what

458
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:48.52
we were going to do.

459
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:52.52
And told us, yeah, we got something eating a mess on or lacks.

460
00:33:52.52 --> 00:33:57.04
They'd be a movie showing that night and we're thinking a movie.

461
00:33:57.04 --> 00:34:04.24
So they had constructed some kind of bleachers at this low-pand area, nailed up a few sheets

462
00:34:04.24 --> 00:34:11.76
of plywood and had a movie projector and they would get movies from somewhere and they would

463
00:34:11.76 --> 00:34:14.16
show a movie out there.

464
00:34:14.16 --> 00:34:16.96
So we went, let's go watch the movie.

465
00:34:16.96 --> 00:34:25.36
And behind that screen was Marble Mountain, which juts up out of the sand, 450 feet, just out

466
00:34:25.36 --> 00:34:26.36
of nowhere.

467
00:34:26.36 --> 00:34:28.36
They were judging up there.

468
00:34:28.36 --> 00:34:29.80
And there's two peaks.

469
00:34:29.80 --> 00:34:36.52
East peak up there has a combat outpost on it because it's the bad guys, you know, got

470
00:34:36.52 --> 00:34:37.52
up there.

471
00:34:37.52 --> 00:34:40.04
They could shoot right down into the combat.

472
00:34:40.04 --> 00:34:43.64
So we're watching the movie and all of a sudden red and green tracers are going here.

473
00:34:43.64 --> 00:34:46.76
I mean, this is Chris Cross and Bob and I are starting to hit the ground and everybody

474
00:34:46.76 --> 00:34:48.40
else says, watch the movie.

475
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:51.000
And I asked one guy, what's going on?

476
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
He's so worried about it.

477
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
That happens every night.

478
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.32
They've got to get the guys off to combat outpost and you know, we put on a little light

479
00:34:59.32 --> 00:35:00.32
show up there.

480
00:35:00.32 --> 00:35:01.32
It'll be fine.

481
00:35:01.32 --> 00:35:03.52
They won't shoot down here because they're getting shot out.

482
00:35:03.52 --> 00:35:05.76
They shoot back at those people.

483
00:35:05.76 --> 00:35:09.12
And well, that's interesting.

484
00:35:09.12 --> 00:35:13.52
So then what happens?

485
00:35:13.52 --> 00:35:15.84
Everyone else got sent to one zero school.

486
00:35:15.84 --> 00:35:18.48
Did Bob get sent to one zero school or is he the same as you?

487
00:35:18.48 --> 00:35:23.36
Well, before that, the next morning we got our briefing.

488
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:27.60
We went into the, to the headquarters into the briefing room and, you know, the Colonel

489
00:35:27.60 --> 00:35:31.72
came in and said, okay, let me, let me tell you what socks about.

490
00:35:31.72 --> 00:35:34.24
Let me tell you what you're going to be doing.

491
00:35:34.24 --> 00:35:40.40
And he uncovered some maps on the wall and started talking about the kinds of missions

492
00:35:40.40 --> 00:35:44.24
that we would be going on and that, you know, we would be put on teams.

493
00:35:44.24 --> 00:35:48.68
And we'd be leading those missions and you kind of explained that, you know, at three major

494
00:35:48.68 --> 00:35:59.12
areas, you had the northern area, which was CCN there, but the forward operational base

495
00:35:59.12 --> 00:36:01.36
was up in Fubi.

496
00:36:01.36 --> 00:36:05.000
And so he explained where the, the different camps were.

497
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And then after that, you know, it told me I'd be going to Alpha V1 up north.

498
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.32
Bob would be going down to Central down around the contain, you know, so we went

499
00:36:15.32 --> 00:36:17.52
on a different way to that point.

500
00:36:17.52 --> 00:36:23.32
Did, uh, when he started briefing on what the missions consisted of, did you, did you have

501
00:36:23.32 --> 00:36:26.60
any, was your guess anywhere close to that?

502
00:36:26.60 --> 00:36:30.36
Did you, did you have any idea and say, yeah, that's probably what I thought we would be

503
00:36:30.36 --> 00:36:31.52
doing was it close?

504
00:36:31.52 --> 00:36:39.44
I had heard rumors that maybe they operated outside of the Vietnam, you know, so they didn't

505
00:36:39.44 --> 00:36:42.64
surprise me that much when he started talking about the countries we were going to

506
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:45.28
actually go into.

507
00:36:45.28 --> 00:36:48.08
The kinds of missions didn't surprise me too much.

508
00:36:48.08 --> 00:36:55.52
I mean, a few of them did, but for the most part, it was, wow, this is pretty cool.

509
00:36:55.52 --> 00:36:58.40
It's crazy, but it's pretty cool.

510
00:36:58.40 --> 00:37:00.88
Do he talk to you at all about casualty rates or anything?

511
00:37:00.88 --> 00:37:01.88
No.

512
00:37:01.88 --> 00:37:02.88
No.

513
00:37:02.88 --> 00:37:03.88
All right.

514
00:37:03.88 --> 00:37:06.40
So, so then what happens?

515
00:37:06.40 --> 00:37:07.40
You get a sign?

516
00:37:07.40 --> 00:37:15.36
Yeah, so I went to FOP-1 at Fubi with a group of other people and when we got there, they

517
00:37:15.36 --> 00:37:20.36
grabbed everybody, but me and said, you know, you guys are going to one zero school.

518
00:37:20.36 --> 00:37:26.72
So a week long course to teach him how to be a leader, small team, and the jungle.

519
00:37:26.72 --> 00:37:34.08
There were a few things that they probably got that I hadn't done already, but not much.

520
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:38.60
So I was a sign or told I'd be a sign to the team the next morning.

521
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:43.12
So many go report over to the supply room.

522
00:37:43.12 --> 00:37:46.84
They had a mission for me first, then I needed to do.

523
00:37:46.84 --> 00:37:54.76
So I want to get there to tell me that we had some casualties, and that their personal

524
00:37:54.76 --> 00:38:00.20
effects had to be mentored by an officer before they could be sent home.

525
00:38:00.20 --> 00:38:04.44
And he said, you know, there are duffle bags are in there.

526
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:12.16
You know, if you just dump them out, go through them, look for anything that might be classified

527
00:38:12.16 --> 00:38:15.48
a map or anything like that.

528
00:38:15.48 --> 00:38:20.000
If there's any correspondence in there, read it, make sure it doesn't say anything about

529
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.96
any of the missions.

530
00:38:21.96 --> 00:38:27.24
If there are pictures, you know, get all the pictures out.

531
00:38:27.24 --> 00:38:32.000
So pretty well, you know, sterilize their gear.

532
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.60
So the first bag I picked up, I went over to name, I thought, wow, you know, I know

533
00:38:37.60 --> 00:38:38.60
him.

534
00:38:38.60 --> 00:38:44.52
So this was a guy that, you know, we had run around with some at Bragg, so I already knew

535
00:38:44.52 --> 00:38:45.52
him.

536
00:38:45.52 --> 00:38:51.32
And he came over, you know, about a month before me, and now I remember enjoying your

537
00:38:51.32 --> 00:38:52.32
stuff.

538
00:38:52.32 --> 00:38:54.52
So I kind of got my attention.

539
00:38:54.52 --> 00:38:57.60
So that the casters are great.

540
00:38:57.60 --> 00:38:59.80
You know, probably there's pretty high here.

541
00:38:59.80 --> 00:39:05.04
But then the next day I was, you know, assigned to a team as the one one, the assistant

542
00:39:05.04 --> 00:39:06.04
team leader.

543
00:39:06.04 --> 00:39:10.64
And, you know, we started mission prep to get ready to do out.

544
00:39:10.64 --> 00:39:11.92
Who is the team leader?

545
00:39:11.92 --> 00:39:13.88
Sergeant deck.

546
00:39:13.88 --> 00:39:17.88
So it's very cool that even though you were an officer, you were going to be a second

547
00:39:17.88 --> 00:39:18.88
in command.

548
00:39:18.88 --> 00:39:23.52
No one, no one was going to walk into a team regardless of your rank.

549
00:39:23.52 --> 00:39:28.56
And just, you know, say I'm here and I'm the team leader.

550
00:39:28.56 --> 00:39:37.44
You had to, regardless of your rank, you had to go out as an assistant or lower and learn

551
00:39:37.44 --> 00:39:38.80
how to lead a team.

552
00:39:38.80 --> 00:39:41.20
Learn what's going on out there.

553
00:39:41.20 --> 00:39:44.28
And eventually you get checked off by the team leader.

554
00:39:44.28 --> 00:39:49.88
You would, you know, like Sergeant deck had to say, okay, Thompson can lead a team now.

555
00:39:49.88 --> 00:39:55.76
And that put me put me on the list to take over the next team, you know, that was available.

556
00:39:55.76 --> 00:39:57.52
So what did the team consist of?

557
00:39:57.52 --> 00:40:03.96
My self, you know, Sergeant deck, myself and another American.

558
00:40:03.96 --> 00:40:10.12
And then, you know, we had probably nine indigenous members on the team.

559
00:40:10.12 --> 00:40:14.56
And who are the first indigenous, what kind of indigenous class the first group of Vietnamese

560
00:40:14.56 --> 00:40:15.56
and Vietnamese?

561
00:40:15.56 --> 00:40:16.56
Yeah, Vietnamese.

562
00:40:16.56 --> 00:40:20.76
And then did you, did you go through any training protocol to be ready for your first

563
00:40:20.76 --> 00:40:21.76
mission or what would you do?

564
00:40:21.76 --> 00:40:22.76
What would you do?

565
00:40:22.76 --> 00:40:27.56
I mean, we just, we started training right away once I was assigned, you know, deck

566
00:40:27.56 --> 00:40:29.60
grabbed me up and started talking to me.

567
00:40:29.60 --> 00:40:30.60
This is what you've got to do.

568
00:40:30.60 --> 00:40:32.24
And you just want to look and pour.

569
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:33.24
Here's what we're going.

570
00:40:33.24 --> 00:40:34.24
What we're going to do.

571
00:40:34.24 --> 00:40:35.24
We took the team out.

572
00:40:35.24 --> 00:40:40.80
We started doing the media action drills and preparation for what we were going to do on

573
00:40:40.80 --> 00:40:43.08
the mission.

574
00:40:43.08 --> 00:40:45.48
How long did you guys have the train before you guys were going on?

575
00:40:45.48 --> 00:40:46.92
No, your first mission.

576
00:40:46.92 --> 00:40:53.64
It was probably eight to ten days before we actually went out.

577
00:40:53.64 --> 00:41:00.72
So I had a little time to get to know the team better, to learn all the drills and the

578
00:41:00.72 --> 00:41:02.80
way they did things.

579
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:06.000
What was the level of English speaking for your indigenous groups?

580
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Very good for the interpreter.

581
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.04
And the others, they understood some words.

582
00:41:12.04 --> 00:41:16.60
And the common words that you would use get down, stop, you know, things like that,

583
00:41:16.60 --> 00:41:21.68
that you used all the time, but you couldn't carry on the conversation.

584
00:41:21.68 --> 00:41:26.24
And what was your, how good was your level of focus during this time?

585
00:41:26.24 --> 00:41:30.36
I imagine you must have been just as focused as a human being.

586
00:41:30.36 --> 00:41:31.36
Again.

587
00:41:31.36 --> 00:41:33.52
That's when this is real.

588
00:41:33.52 --> 00:41:35.80
So totally focused.

589
00:41:35.80 --> 00:41:39.52
There's nothing else on my mind.

590
00:41:39.52 --> 00:41:47.36
In fact, we had a little theater there at Fubak, paddled top on it.

591
00:41:47.36 --> 00:41:50.80
So if it rained, we didn't get wet, but some old benches were saying, I want to be

592
00:41:50.80 --> 00:41:53.40
supply boy to movie was on.

593
00:41:53.40 --> 00:41:55.88
So I went to a movie after a couple of days.

594
00:41:55.88 --> 00:41:56.88
They had one.

595
00:41:56.88 --> 00:41:59.68
I went to the movie that even I'm setting there.

596
00:41:59.68 --> 00:42:04.56
And I hear this loud, pal, when the guy next to me falls off on the ground, I think.

597
00:42:04.56 --> 00:42:09.20
And you know, because we're setting outside, we just have a little top on.

598
00:42:09.20 --> 00:42:12.40
And you fall over on the ground, he's at the shoulder.

599
00:42:12.40 --> 00:42:13.40
All right.

600
00:42:13.40 --> 00:42:16.68
Well, it didn't matter where you are.

601
00:42:16.68 --> 00:42:19.96
That puts a doweler on, moving on.

602
00:42:19.96 --> 00:42:24.60
Yeah, I wasn't that much in the movie.

603
00:42:24.60 --> 00:42:25.60
All right.

604
00:42:25.60 --> 00:42:29.44
So now what's the first mission that you guys get aside?

605
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:34.60
They were doing some testing, whom I got other things, in addition to just sending

606
00:42:34.60 --> 00:42:35.60
us on the mission.

607
00:42:35.60 --> 00:42:39.16
They were trying to figure out what was the best time to put a team on the ground?

608
00:42:39.16 --> 00:42:42.88
Should you put them in right at first light?

609
00:42:42.88 --> 00:42:48.60
So when you get off the aircraft, you can move out and head to wherever you're going

610
00:42:48.60 --> 00:42:49.60
to go.

611
00:42:49.60 --> 00:42:50.96
You're getting away from the hills.

612
00:42:50.96 --> 00:42:55.000
E quickly, you know, because the bad guys had figured out that you had been inserted,

613
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.20
they'd come out and start looking for it.

614
00:42:57.20 --> 00:42:59.000
Orange was the best way to do it.

615
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.32
Go in at last light.

616
00:43:00.32 --> 00:43:02.000
So it's dark.

617
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
You get off the hills.

618
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.28
You set up in your remainder of a night position and then head out at first light.

619
00:43:10.28 --> 00:43:18.000
So if the NVA or tractors are coming after you, then they were having to do it in a dark.

620
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.80
So our team had been selected to be a last light insertion to see how that worked.

621
00:43:25.80 --> 00:43:32.68
So you know, and I had already been briefed on some things like we go in high.

622
00:43:32.68 --> 00:43:40.12
Go in 3,000 feet or so when we're flying to the LZ to avoid small orange fire coming up

623
00:43:40.12 --> 00:43:41.12
at us.

624
00:43:41.12 --> 00:43:51.20
And then when you get out there to the LZ, he's going to bank to aircraft on the side.

625
00:43:51.20 --> 00:43:57.000
And he's going to put it in auto rotate and hits just going to fall out of the sky and

626
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.96
the spiral until he gets to where you want to make his short final coming into the LZ.

627
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:07.68
And then you'll put the power back on and slow it down and we'll come in.

628
00:44:07.68 --> 00:44:10.68
I was not quite prepared for that.

629
00:44:10.68 --> 00:44:12.92
I mean, I understood the concept.

630
00:44:12.92 --> 00:44:14.56
What are you saying?

631
00:44:14.56 --> 00:44:20.92
But I didn't realize that when he put that thing in auto rotate, I wasn't going to be

632
00:44:20.92 --> 00:44:22.56
setting on anything.

633
00:44:22.56 --> 00:44:27.52
And then I was on the side that it was turned toward. So I'm just hanging out the area

634
00:44:27.52 --> 00:44:32.20
in the air holding onto the side of the aircraft, looking down 3,000 feet and saying,

635
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:34.20
this is not good.

636
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:36.96
Now, my stomach's up in my throat.

637
00:44:36.96 --> 00:44:39.60
And it's like a thrill ride at the fair or something.

638
00:44:39.60 --> 00:44:41.20
This thing is falling.

639
00:44:41.20 --> 00:44:45.60
And I'm just trying to hang on and stay in there.

640
00:44:45.60 --> 00:44:49.56
So we spiral into and we come around and we're coming in on a short final.

641
00:44:49.56 --> 00:44:59.20
Some of the ridge line and they had dropped what was called a Daisy Cutter, 2000 pound bomb

642
00:44:59.20 --> 00:45:03.80
to blow a hole into canopy big enough that we could set the helicopter down.

643
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:07.68
And we're coming in, we're flying over a little pond on the ridge line.

644
00:45:07.68 --> 00:45:13.68
And I'm climbing out on the skid of the helicopter myself.

645
00:45:13.68 --> 00:45:18.96
And the other American, the team leaders on the other side.

646
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:24.52
So we're climbing out on the skid and I'm thinking, man.

647
00:45:24.52 --> 00:45:27.52
I mean, we're going really slow.

648
00:45:27.52 --> 00:45:30.72
And I'm just a setting target.

649
00:45:30.72 --> 00:45:33.20
I mean, they could just knock me off of this thing any time.

650
00:45:33.20 --> 00:45:36.000
That's not good.

651
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So we come up and we had to literally go straight down into the bomb crater.

652
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.04
So the pilot's trying not to clip trees as we're setting down.

653
00:45:47.04 --> 00:45:50.64
It's just getting dark.

654
00:45:50.64 --> 00:45:57.20
And we're going in and myself and the other guy are on the skid.

655
00:45:57.20 --> 00:46:00.20
And we're close enough and he slowed down enough.

656
00:46:00.20 --> 00:46:01.20
Okay, this is it.

657
00:46:01.20 --> 00:46:04.80
We're going to have to jump on down into the bomb crater.

658
00:46:04.80 --> 00:46:07.64
I bent my knees to jump.

659
00:46:07.64 --> 00:46:12.92
And just as I did, I saw the guy pop up on my right about 10 feet.

660
00:46:12.92 --> 00:46:17.000
You know, kind of off to the side with an AK 47.

661
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.40
And just instantly instead of jumping, I pushed back, jumped back up on the edge of the

662
00:46:22.40 --> 00:46:23.40
helicopter.

663
00:46:23.40 --> 00:46:27.44
Just as I jumped up, he opens up with the AK.

664
00:46:27.44 --> 00:46:30.92
And the bullets come right across where my legs were.

665
00:46:30.92 --> 00:46:35.76
But now I moved and they hit, you know, they're other American on the other side of me.

666
00:46:35.76 --> 00:46:37.44
Hit him in the legs.

667
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:39.32
So he starts the fall.

668
00:46:39.32 --> 00:46:46.32
So I'm grabbing the back of his harness where my left hand and I put a half of magazine

669
00:46:46.32 --> 00:46:48.88
and the guy, you know, that's right there.

670
00:46:48.88 --> 00:46:50.88
I hose them down.

671
00:46:50.88 --> 00:46:55.96
I managed to jerk the other guy up onto the floor of the helicopter and then I could

672
00:46:55.96 --> 00:47:00.48
turn and put him, you know, I could just see him also flashing right in front of me.

673
00:47:00.48 --> 00:47:03.84
So I put the other hand on the magazine there.

674
00:47:03.84 --> 00:47:07.08
So now I'm empty.

675
00:47:07.08 --> 00:47:13.40
And when we go in, when you'd go in, you would have gunships who would come in alongside

676
00:47:13.40 --> 00:47:14.40
your.

677
00:47:14.40 --> 00:47:17.12
So it would in case something happened.

678
00:47:17.12 --> 00:47:21.000
So we're in a full-fledged ambush now all the way around us.

679
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.56
Two cover gunships open up where there are many guns, 4,000 rounds a minute coming in,

680
00:47:26.56 --> 00:47:32.08
looking like two hose pipes just spraying red water all around us.

681
00:47:32.08 --> 00:47:35.92
And a lot of people don't realize this, bullets don't just hit the ground and going

682
00:47:35.92 --> 00:47:36.92
to ground.

683
00:47:36.92 --> 00:47:40.64
They bounce all over the place and if they're trees there, they're shooting trees, they're

684
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:41.96
going around.

685
00:47:41.96 --> 00:47:46.96
So I'm trying to pull him, I'm trying to pull him back up inside the helicopter.

686
00:47:46.96 --> 00:47:51.20
I got the door gunner on my side, full blast.

687
00:47:51.20 --> 00:47:57.000
The cobras coming in and they're also shooting 40 millimeter grenades at 250 a minute.

688
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.28
So we got that going on.

689
00:47:58.28 --> 00:48:02.28
I got two team members behind me using me for cover.

690
00:48:02.28 --> 00:48:05.56
So I've got a muzzle on each side of my head right here.

691
00:48:05.56 --> 00:48:10.32
I'm getting powder burns from the muzzle flashes coming out of that.

692
00:48:10.32 --> 00:48:14.60
I got hot brass coming from them coming from the door gunner, going all over me.

693
00:48:14.60 --> 00:48:19.80
The floor is now covered with blood, blood squirting out of his legs.

694
00:48:19.80 --> 00:48:22.08
And my magazine is empty.

695
00:48:22.08 --> 00:48:26.84
So I'm trying to get to magazine out of my pouts that I've guided in.

696
00:48:26.84 --> 00:48:32.96
And you know, it went in things I talked about and you know, the stress book is that when

697
00:48:32.96 --> 00:48:37.84
your stress level gets really high, you lose your fine motor coordination.

698
00:48:37.84 --> 00:48:43.04
Things that you can do very easily when you're not stressed just don't work for you anymore.

699
00:48:43.04 --> 00:48:47.84
So I'm trying to have a trouble getting the magazine out of the pouts to start with.

700
00:48:47.84 --> 00:48:51.28
I finally get it out and then I can't get it in a weapon.

701
00:48:51.28 --> 00:48:56.44
And I'm setting there and I've just seeing hundreds and hundreds of bullets and tracers

702
00:48:56.44 --> 00:48:57.44
coming.

703
00:48:57.44 --> 00:49:00.92
Green tracers, Chris Cross and inside the aircraft.

704
00:49:00.92 --> 00:49:05.16
So green tracers, Chris crossing inside the aircraft.

705
00:49:05.16 --> 00:49:06.16
That's what she's like.

706
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:09.08
Just explain to everybody that doesn't know what that means.

707
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:10.80
That's insane.

708
00:49:10.80 --> 00:49:18.36
That means that enemy bullets, Vietnam, the Americans and used red tracers and the enemy

709
00:49:18.36 --> 00:49:19.96
used green tracers.

710
00:49:19.96 --> 00:49:22.52
And I don't think it's not really like that anymore.

711
00:49:22.52 --> 00:49:23.84
Everybody uses red tracers.

712
00:49:23.84 --> 00:49:25.36
And that was what was like for us.

713
00:49:25.36 --> 00:49:27.36
And in Iraq and in Iraq and in Iraq and in Iraq and in Iraq and in Iraq and in Iraq and in

714
00:49:27.36 --> 00:49:30.88
sense the same thing after Afghanistan, very rarely with they see green tracers.

715
00:49:30.88 --> 00:49:35.88
But for enemy tracers to be Chris crossing inside of your helicopter and this was a

716
00:49:35.88 --> 00:49:36.88
hewie, right?

717
00:49:36.88 --> 00:49:37.88
Yeah.

718
00:49:37.88 --> 00:49:38.88
This is not a small.

719
00:49:38.88 --> 00:49:41.40
This is not a big aircraft.

720
00:49:41.40 --> 00:49:42.92
This is a tiny aircraft.

721
00:49:42.92 --> 00:49:44.20
Your packed in there.

722
00:49:44.20 --> 00:49:52.28
So for rounds to be Chris crossing inside that thing, green tracers, that is completely insane.

723
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:53.48
I was thinking that myself.

724
00:49:53.48 --> 00:49:54.48
Yeah.

725
00:49:54.48 --> 00:49:56.12
That's a little voicemail back in my head.

726
00:49:56.12 --> 00:49:57.12
Yeah, this is crazy.

727
00:49:57.12 --> 00:50:00.76
Not only that, but I am not happy.

728
00:50:00.76 --> 00:50:02.64
I mean, this is my first mission.

729
00:50:02.64 --> 00:50:07.20
And I'm going to die on my first, I mean, what kind of deal is this?

730
00:50:07.20 --> 00:50:08.84
I came over here to do something.

731
00:50:08.84 --> 00:50:12.20
So that little voice is going on back there and the other one's saying.

732
00:50:12.20 --> 00:50:16.20
This is like 15 seconds into your first mission.

733
00:50:16.20 --> 00:50:17.20
Yeah.

734
00:50:17.20 --> 00:50:18.20
I mean, it's right there.

735
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:24.92
Ricochet is going all over the place from the covers and things.

736
00:50:24.92 --> 00:50:30.000
So the guys roll around, screaming, holding this leg and the blood squirting around.

737
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
And you're also hearing the metallic clane, just clane with the bullets hidden in the helicopter.

738
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.20
And you're thinking too, this thing's going to go down.

739
00:50:40.20 --> 00:50:45.44
We're going to end up in this bomb crater right there.

740
00:50:45.44 --> 00:50:46.80
So all of that's going on.

741
00:50:46.80 --> 00:50:50.000
I finally managed to get the other magazine in.

742
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.24
So then I can start to shoot at the muscle flashes that I'm seeing.

743
00:50:55.24 --> 00:51:01.16
And the second time I go to reload, I was a little better with that one.

744
00:51:01.16 --> 00:51:03.000
Got it in there a little faster.

745
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.12
The aircraft started to really vibrate now because she's trying to lift up out of that

746
00:51:08.12 --> 00:51:10.16
little hole in the canopy.

747
00:51:10.16 --> 00:51:12.80
So I'm thinking at least we're trying to start up.

748
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:14.16
But this stuff is still coming.

749
00:51:14.16 --> 00:51:15.16
It's still hitting us.

750
00:51:15.16 --> 00:51:20.68
You just got to, you know, covers making more raids and now what's also happening.

751
00:51:20.68 --> 00:51:22.20
I can't really see it.

752
00:51:22.20 --> 00:51:28.36
But the A1 skysators that are out there on station willus, they give us some protection.

753
00:51:28.36 --> 00:51:34.60
They're starting to drop 500 pound bombs just a little waste from us because those little

754
00:51:34.60 --> 00:51:41.92
datch crew huts that I saw out there as we were spiraling in turned out to have tanks underneath

755
00:51:41.92 --> 00:51:42.92
them.

756
00:51:42.92 --> 00:51:49.76
They had just put that staff around and they come look like a little huts but really there

757
00:51:49.76 --> 00:51:50.76
was tanks.

758
00:51:50.76 --> 00:51:56.40
When the tanks started moving, the skysators went after them and so you got all the bombing

759
00:51:56.40 --> 00:51:59.32
and strapping of those guys going on.

760
00:51:59.32 --> 00:52:03.36
You got the gunships hitting all around us.

761
00:52:03.36 --> 00:52:08.48
We're trying to come out and eventually we managed to get up out of that hole.

762
00:52:08.48 --> 00:52:09.84
The fire just shifted.

763
00:52:09.84 --> 00:52:16.36
The skysators are going up but as we pulled away from it, then that fire stopped because

764
00:52:16.36 --> 00:52:22.96
now the cover really opened up on the ambush site and I looked across that sergeant

765
00:52:22.96 --> 00:52:28.44
deck setting over on the other side and he looked at me with a big grin on his face and

766
00:52:28.44 --> 00:52:34.72
he gave me a thumbs up and I'm thinking, oh, why is wrong with this guy?

767
00:52:34.72 --> 00:52:36.28
So I mean he was so excited.

768
00:52:36.28 --> 00:52:39.80
I mean he thought that was the coolest thing and I'm thinking, man, almost done.

769
00:52:39.80 --> 00:52:44.12
This was my first time.

770
00:52:44.12 --> 00:52:50.48
I experienced a level of fear that I didn't know existed.

771
00:52:50.48 --> 00:52:55.52
I mean I tried to imagine a lot about what's it like when people start shooting at you.

772
00:52:55.52 --> 00:52:58.72
Of course you're going to be a little anxious.

773
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:00.40
So what is it going to be?

774
00:53:00.40 --> 00:53:02.92
I had no clue.

775
00:53:02.92 --> 00:53:09.78
I couldn't even imagine a level of fear like that but, you know, fortunately I was

776
00:53:09.78 --> 00:53:11.78
able to control that part of the fear.

777
00:53:11.78 --> 00:53:14.66
I could still shoot.

778
00:53:14.66 --> 00:53:18.86
It didn't stop me from returning fire and doing what I needed to do but man, it scared

779
00:53:18.86 --> 00:53:19.86
me.

780
00:53:19.86 --> 00:53:26.70
Having no two weapons right next to my head, I mean my high-frequency hearing was steadily

781
00:53:26.70 --> 00:53:36.74
going away permanently, getting burned with the muzzle flashes coming out of there.

782
00:53:36.74 --> 00:53:42.42
Feel my first two people for sure, the guy down below and the first guy shot that and

783
00:53:42.42 --> 00:53:48.90
the tree because also him come out and know I took those two out and I hit several others.

784
00:53:48.90 --> 00:53:53.26
Save the first Americans life because if he had fallen in the crater, he'd have been gone.

785
00:53:53.26 --> 00:53:56.98
A second later we'd have both jumped in that crater and we'd have both been gone.

786
00:53:56.98 --> 00:53:58.82
That's bad tactics on their part, right?

787
00:53:58.82 --> 00:54:00.82
They should have held for another two seconds.

788
00:54:00.82 --> 00:54:04.42
They should have held a strong ground and they would have been still been able to possibly

789
00:54:04.42 --> 00:54:05.42
damage that helicopter.

790
00:54:05.42 --> 00:54:11.38
Yeah, so you know, I earned my combat infantryman's badge.

791
00:54:11.38 --> 00:54:12.38
Yeah, you did.

792
00:54:12.38 --> 00:54:22.94
I had a whole series of first that occurred right there and survived that and a couple

793
00:54:22.94 --> 00:54:27.82
minutes later I'm thinking man, we got out of that and I looked down and here comes a stream

794
00:54:27.82 --> 00:54:32.62
of tracers coming up, out of a 51 caliber or something.

795
00:54:32.62 --> 00:54:40.18
They were trying to hit the helicopter, they were waistplummers but I think it's not over yet.

796
00:54:40.18 --> 00:54:45.86
We got to get out of here and get back and I told the door gunner, we got to go straight

797
00:54:45.86 --> 00:54:51.94
to the hospital, we got to drop this guy off and he's got to have medical attention right

798
00:54:51.94 --> 00:54:52.94
away.

799
00:54:52.94 --> 00:55:00.70
Yeah, so we dropped him off and went back to the launch site to drop the team off.

800
00:55:00.70 --> 00:55:05.78
I asked the sergeant deck, I said, I'm just curious.

801
00:55:05.78 --> 00:55:11.74
How many magazines did you fire when we were back there?

802
00:55:11.74 --> 00:55:18.42
And he said, I emptied five, I had to six put in, I was getting ready to start on that,

803
00:55:18.42 --> 00:55:23.26
through two fragmentation grenades on the smoke grenade.

804
00:55:23.26 --> 00:55:29.74
And then he said, Lieutenant, you need to practice so you get faster reloading when people

805
00:55:29.74 --> 00:55:32.26
are shooting after you or you're going to die.

806
00:55:32.26 --> 00:55:34.26
Okay, I'll practice.

807
00:55:34.26 --> 00:55:38.50
Yeah, because when you talk about the fine motor skills disappearing, but if you practice

808
00:55:38.50 --> 00:55:42.26
all the time, you'll be able to maintain them.

809
00:55:42.26 --> 00:55:43.26
To some degree.

810
00:55:43.26 --> 00:55:45.90
Yeah, there won't be as good but they'll be better.

811
00:55:45.90 --> 00:55:52.14
Yeah, because that's part of the problem with training.

812
00:55:52.14 --> 00:55:57.98
You train, you train to get a good site picture, side alignment and all that and you squeeze

813
00:55:57.98 --> 00:56:02.10
the trigger and hit your target.

814
00:56:02.10 --> 00:56:04.10
That's not shooting back at you.

815
00:56:04.10 --> 00:56:11.18
And then you get in a firefight like that and your stress level skyrockets and when it does,

816
00:56:11.18 --> 00:56:13.30
you can't see the site on the weapon.

817
00:56:13.30 --> 00:56:15.74
I mean, you train to use those sites.

818
00:56:15.74 --> 00:56:20.44
And now all of a sudden, your vision changes as the stress goes up, you can't focus on the

819
00:56:20.44 --> 00:56:21.82
sites.

820
00:56:21.82 --> 00:56:26.10
So you can't do it to where you train.

821
00:56:26.10 --> 00:56:28.38
You can't reload the way you train.

822
00:56:28.38 --> 00:56:30.22
You train to turn sideways and shoot.

823
00:56:30.22 --> 00:56:34.70
And all of a sudden, when all the stuff is coming at you, your body, your brain takes over

824
00:56:34.70 --> 00:56:39.26
and says face the enemy and then your body is going to turn you toward the enemy.

825
00:56:39.26 --> 00:56:41.38
So you've got to train to shoot at the enemy.

826
00:56:41.38 --> 00:56:45.38
You've got to train to shoot without aiming.

827
00:56:45.38 --> 00:56:50.74
So it's been, now I had been through pretty extensive course on something that we call

828
00:56:50.74 --> 00:56:53.86
quick kill where we train to shoot from the hill.

829
00:56:53.86 --> 00:57:00.54
And we started with BB guns and shot at little minister of silhouettes on a 2x4 shooting

830
00:57:00.54 --> 00:57:04.14
from the hill where the BB gun into and you could knock them all down and then we started

831
00:57:04.14 --> 00:57:09.42
the one disk up in three inch dives up in the air and you shoot with the BB gun until you

832
00:57:09.42 --> 00:57:11.58
could hit that moving disk.

833
00:57:11.58 --> 00:57:16.42
And then the disk would get smaller and smaller and then we would go onto a course where

834
00:57:16.42 --> 00:57:21.04
the target's popped up and it was lined fire in terms of, you know, you're using your

835
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:26.32
weapon and shoot from the hill and you know, get so you could hit all the targets.

836
00:57:26.32 --> 00:57:34.000
So we practiced a lot and with the teams that I had, I just drilled it in or had, you've

837
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.20
got to be able to shoot without aiming.

838
00:57:36.20 --> 00:57:40.72
You don't have time to bring up and try to look through a site and it's happening too

839
00:57:40.72 --> 00:57:41.72
fast.

840
00:57:41.72 --> 00:57:44.24
You would dead before you can get it up there.

841
00:57:44.24 --> 00:57:49.12
So there are a lot of techniques that I had brought in that I had learned before I got

842
00:57:49.12 --> 00:57:55.88
here and then, you know, kind of, developed across time and always trained at teams.

843
00:57:55.88 --> 00:57:57.52
Do you guys do it like this?

844
00:57:57.52 --> 00:57:58.52
That's quick.

845
00:57:58.52 --> 00:58:07.88
One of the NCOs that told me, one night at the Dubai, said, you can't hesitate.

846
00:58:07.88 --> 00:58:09.12
There's no hesitation.

847
00:58:09.12 --> 00:58:12.56
You got to understand Lieutenant where you're going.

848
00:58:12.56 --> 00:58:14.76
Everybody is the enemy.

849
00:58:14.76 --> 00:58:20.36
You don't have to worry about shooting, friendly, by my state, they're all enemy.

850
00:58:20.36 --> 00:58:24.48
The person it shoots first has the highest probability of surviving.

851
00:58:24.48 --> 00:58:31.36
Pull the trigger and never, ever shoot anybody less than three or four times.

852
00:58:31.36 --> 00:58:34.84
If you still move, you shoot them three or four more times.

853
00:58:34.84 --> 00:58:37.08
There's no one shot and move to the next guy.

854
00:58:37.08 --> 00:58:39.08
You make sure they go down.

855
00:58:39.08 --> 00:58:47.60
So that was kind of the strategy I adopted and practiced to be able to do that.

856
00:58:47.60 --> 00:58:54.80
I can go from the safety position on the selector switch to fully automatic, faster

857
00:58:54.80 --> 00:58:59.28
than most people can pull the trigger with the safety already off.

858
00:58:59.28 --> 00:59:01.16
I used to practice that.

859
00:59:01.16 --> 00:59:02.68
I used to practice it going down.

860
00:59:02.68 --> 00:59:07.28
I also would discover that with AK-47, this scene is they start to shoot at you, the barrel

861
00:59:07.28 --> 00:59:08.28
rises.

862
00:59:08.28 --> 00:59:12.48
If they don't hit you with that first or second round, if you can get down, you've got

863
00:59:12.48 --> 00:59:18.48
to change the survival and I used to practice shooting on the way down and put silhouettes

864
00:59:18.48 --> 00:59:21.68
out, hit them all before I hit the ground as I'm going down.

865
00:59:21.68 --> 00:59:23.68
I didn't hit that magazine.

866
00:59:23.68 --> 00:59:26.32
So anything that's kind of good on all of track here.

867
00:59:26.32 --> 00:59:29.80
That's actually right on track.

868
00:59:29.80 --> 00:59:33.48
You come back from this first mission.

869
00:59:33.48 --> 00:59:35.68
What do you think now?

870
00:59:35.68 --> 00:59:39.52
You've got to be thinking yourself, there's no possible way I'm living through this.

871
00:59:39.52 --> 00:59:46.08
Well, actually the way my mind works, I was critiquing.

872
00:59:46.08 --> 00:59:47.44
What should we have done?

873
00:59:47.44 --> 00:59:49.56
What should we have trained on beforehand?

874
00:59:49.56 --> 00:59:50.92
What did we do there?

875
00:59:50.92 --> 00:59:54.48
Were we prepared for an ambush like that?

876
00:59:54.48 --> 00:59:56.56
Was there anything else we could have done?

877
00:59:56.56 --> 01:00:02.40
So I was playing through our preparation, playing my mind through what we actually

878
01:00:02.40 --> 01:00:03.72
did.

879
01:00:03.72 --> 01:00:07.72
What could we do differently next time?

880
01:00:07.72 --> 01:00:10.04
In my mind, you've got to get better every time.

881
01:00:10.04 --> 01:00:14.20
Every time you do something, you need to be better than the last time that you did it.

882
01:00:14.20 --> 01:00:16.20
You need to understand it.

883
01:00:16.20 --> 01:00:18.24
You're going to always have to adapt.

884
01:00:18.24 --> 01:00:21.60
Whatever you plan, you're going to have to adapt.

885
01:00:21.60 --> 01:00:23.96
War is just not predictable.

886
01:00:23.96 --> 01:00:27.84
It's predictability is it's going to change.

887
01:00:27.84 --> 01:00:30.72
You've got to be able to do that and do it on the fly.

888
01:00:30.72 --> 01:00:35.28
I was telling you I had just had a guy on the podcast, hasn't come out yet, but I had a guy

889
01:00:35.28 --> 01:00:37.96
that was he went into Goalism Marine.

890
01:00:37.96 --> 01:00:41.24
He went into Guadalcanal, Taroa, Sipan, Tinyan.

891
01:00:41.24 --> 01:00:47.64
Got wounded in Taroa, got shot while he was still 500 meters from the beach trying to get

892
01:00:47.64 --> 01:00:50.56
across that hell that they were walking through.

893
01:00:50.56 --> 01:00:55.68
But we had that discussion around, you know, always thinking it's like nothing will happen

894
01:00:55.68 --> 01:00:56.68
to me.

895
01:00:56.68 --> 01:01:01.76
Use the example of like I always think if I'm going to commercial airplane and it crashes,

896
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:02.76
I'm going to live.

897
01:01:02.76 --> 01:01:04.72
Like I'm going to figure out a way.

898
01:01:04.72 --> 01:01:11.24
I'll do a good free fall position and I'll look, scan, find a pool somewhere, whatever.

899
01:01:11.24 --> 01:01:12.84
Was there any of that?

900
01:01:12.84 --> 01:01:16.24
Because it seems to me like that kind of operation right there.

901
01:01:16.24 --> 01:01:19.96
You've got to look at that and say, even if you have the attitude of it will happen to

902
01:01:19.96 --> 01:01:24.52
someone else, when you've got green trace you're coming through your aircraft, that might

903
01:01:24.52 --> 01:01:28.96
change even my mind and start thinking, okay, probably not going to probably not going

904
01:01:28.96 --> 01:01:31.52
to make it through this.

905
01:01:31.52 --> 01:01:39.32
Yeah, you think that and I've had, I've used up more lives than a cat, just hearing

906
01:01:39.32 --> 01:01:40.32
that time period.

907
01:01:40.32 --> 01:01:43.36
I used up my lives that night.

908
01:01:43.36 --> 01:01:45.36
I never thought that I would.

909
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:46.36
It was two minutes.

910
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:50.60
I never thought I'd see my 21st or 22nd birthday.

911
01:01:50.60 --> 01:01:52.08
I thought there's no way.

912
01:01:52.08 --> 01:01:53.08
You just can't get there for you.

913
01:01:53.08 --> 01:01:54.92
Okay, so whatever you do.

914
01:01:54.92 --> 01:01:57.84
You got to a point where you said, okay, I'm probably not going to make it.

915
01:01:57.84 --> 01:01:59.20
Yeah, that's the way this.

916
01:01:59.20 --> 01:02:06.32
But my attitude is I'm going to take as many of you with me as I can.

917
01:02:06.32 --> 01:02:09.16
You might get me, but you're going to pay for it.

918
01:02:09.16 --> 01:02:12.84
I'll be really upset if you knock me off with the first round and I don't get a chance

919
01:02:12.84 --> 01:02:17.56
to get some of you, but you better do it quick because I'm going to take as many as I

920
01:02:17.56 --> 01:02:21.84
can with me because I'm coming.

921
01:02:21.84 --> 01:02:25.76
Okay, so you guys get back from that mission.

922
01:02:25.76 --> 01:02:26.92
You guys do a good debrief.

923
01:02:26.92 --> 01:02:31.000
You're going through all the points of what you thought you could do better.

924
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.08
You're wondering who is the person that came up with the idea of doing these nine

925
01:02:35.08 --> 01:02:38.72
units shirts and maybe the last light inserts aren't the best.

926
01:02:38.72 --> 01:02:39.72
I don't know.

927
01:02:39.72 --> 01:02:40.72
Because that's another thing.

928
01:02:40.72 --> 01:02:41.72
You don't really know.

929
01:02:41.72 --> 01:02:47.44
It seems to me like if you drop a Daisy cutter and the enemy at least says themselves

930
01:02:47.44 --> 01:02:48.68
well, they drop the Daisy cutter.

931
01:02:48.68 --> 01:02:50.36
They must have done that for a reason.

932
01:02:50.36 --> 01:02:51.36
Let's go surround it.

933
01:02:51.36 --> 01:02:57.40
I mean, why would you drop a 2000 pound, one 2000 pound bomb out here on a ridge line?

934
01:02:57.40 --> 01:02:58.40
Yeah.

935
01:02:58.40 --> 01:02:59.40
And not doing anything else.

936
01:02:59.40 --> 01:03:00.40
That makes you coming.

937
01:03:00.40 --> 01:03:01.40
Yeah.

938
01:03:01.40 --> 01:03:02.40
Unless you're going to come in.

939
01:03:02.40 --> 01:03:08.40
Please drop 15 of them to make the enemy have to spread out a little bit.

940
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:11.88
Not put their entire force surrounded this one crater.

941
01:03:11.88 --> 01:03:12.88
Yeah.

942
01:03:12.88 --> 01:03:15.88
There were a lot of things like that.

943
01:03:15.88 --> 01:03:18.68
I thought about once I got back.

944
01:03:18.68 --> 01:03:22.20
I was making a list.

945
01:03:22.20 --> 01:03:28.92
Unfortunately, I shared some of my lists with the commander of the camp.

946
01:03:28.92 --> 01:03:34.44
He was excited and telling me, I told you we could get you out.

947
01:03:34.44 --> 01:03:35.44
We put you out there.

948
01:03:35.44 --> 01:03:36.44
We're going to get you out.

949
01:03:36.44 --> 01:03:37.44
You saw it work.

950
01:03:37.44 --> 01:03:39.44
I said, I saw it.

951
01:03:39.44 --> 01:03:42.24
Let me share some thoughts with you.

952
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:54.000
Fortunately, I probably had talked in Mr. Jack Daniels two months before I had that conversation.

953
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.48
And I shared a little too much of my thoughts.

954
01:03:58.48 --> 01:04:01.36
He wasn't exactly happy.

955
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:05.96
It's some of the things I had to say because it reflected on him too.

956
01:04:05.96 --> 01:04:08.92
I still think they were right.

957
01:04:08.92 --> 01:04:12.56
You put one, like you said, you put one day he's got her out there.

958
01:04:12.56 --> 01:04:16.84
Why don't we put up a flag for everybody to say, hey, come in here soon.

959
01:04:16.84 --> 01:04:18.48
All right, sir.

960
01:04:18.48 --> 01:04:21.28
Then what's the next mission look like?

961
01:04:21.28 --> 01:04:23.28
I see.

962
01:04:23.28 --> 01:04:29.16
Then I think the next one, the next one we actually had to spend the night.

963
01:04:29.16 --> 01:04:33.16
So we did a lot of planning.

964
01:04:33.16 --> 01:04:37.24
At this point, Sergeant Dex started to listen.

965
01:04:37.24 --> 01:04:39.52
I've got more credibility now.

966
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:41.16
I've been shot at.

967
01:04:41.16 --> 01:04:44.72
And we did okay.

968
01:04:44.72 --> 01:04:50.28
So we put a lot more planning into it, a lot more rehearsal into it.

969
01:04:50.28 --> 01:04:56.20
And when in, got on the ground, an eventful.

970
01:04:56.20 --> 01:05:02.24
And when you would get on the ground, you would move a hundred meters or so into the

971
01:05:02.24 --> 01:05:09.08
jungle, you would stop, set up a security perimeter, and then you adapt.

972
01:05:09.08 --> 01:05:10.08
You listen.

973
01:05:10.08 --> 01:05:11.96
Do you hear any bad guys?

974
01:05:11.96 --> 01:05:12.96
What do you hear?

975
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:15.92
You got to adapt to the sounds of the jungle.

976
01:05:15.92 --> 01:05:19.36
Because the last 45 minutes an hour, all you've heard is, is what, what, what, what, what

977
01:05:19.36 --> 01:05:21.56
are the helicopter?

978
01:05:21.56 --> 01:05:25.88
And you know, so you've had a temporary threshold shift in you here and you can't hear

979
01:05:25.88 --> 01:05:26.88
is good.

980
01:05:26.88 --> 01:05:30.56
You can't smell is good because you've been smelling the JPU four in the helicopter all the

981
01:05:30.56 --> 01:05:31.88
way out there.

982
01:05:31.88 --> 01:05:36.76
But you have that security halt and you adapt to the sounds.

983
01:05:36.76 --> 01:05:38.000
What's out there?

984
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
What do you hear?

985
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.76
What do you see?

986
01:05:41.76 --> 01:05:50.72
In my case, I was very fortunate that I had spider senses, so to speak.

987
01:05:50.72 --> 01:05:55.04
I didn't quite have spider hearing after that.

988
01:05:55.04 --> 01:05:57.000
First little episode.

989
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.36
But I still, I still have a rest of it.

990
01:05:59.36 --> 01:06:03.28
I could smell you, and more than one case, I sniffed out an ambush.

991
01:06:03.28 --> 01:06:04.28
I could smell them.

992
01:06:04.28 --> 01:06:06.28
I could smell their body odor.

993
01:06:06.28 --> 01:06:08.000
I could smell what they had to eat.

994
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.88
I knew they were up in front of us.

995
01:06:10.88 --> 01:06:15.36
I could just feel things like that.

996
01:06:15.36 --> 01:06:17.60
So, we had that.

997
01:06:17.60 --> 01:06:19.52
We sent in team okay.

998
01:06:19.52 --> 01:06:25.64
We had a code word that we just transmit that meant one of team okay moving north, moving

999
01:06:25.64 --> 01:06:26.64
whatever direction.

1000
01:06:26.64 --> 01:06:29.24
Was this a daytime, early, first light insert?

1001
01:06:29.24 --> 01:06:31.24
It was late afternoon.

1002
01:06:31.24 --> 01:06:35.64
Yeah, it wasn't the last light thing again.

1003
01:06:35.64 --> 01:06:43.40
So we had time to move for a ways and then eventually stop for the night.

1004
01:06:43.40 --> 01:06:49.24
Typically what we would do is do like we call it a fish hook.

1005
01:06:49.24 --> 01:06:53.72
You'd move along a little ways and then you would make a turn and you would come back

1006
01:06:53.72 --> 01:06:55.92
down 50 meters or so.

1007
01:06:55.92 --> 01:07:00.12
So if someone was tracking you, you'd hear them go by because they're following your

1008
01:07:00.12 --> 01:07:03.12
trail.

1009
01:07:03.12 --> 01:07:09.84
I would put a very quickly I learned to put out what we call toe poppers.

1010
01:07:09.84 --> 01:07:18.72
It was a little small and a person L mine, plastic and I had to see for in it.

1011
01:07:18.72 --> 01:07:23.92
It would take your leg off or most of your leg if you stepped on it.

1012
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:26.36
I had a lot of experience in the wood woods.

1013
01:07:26.36 --> 01:07:28.68
I know how people are going to track you.

1014
01:07:28.68 --> 01:07:29.96
I know where they're going to walk.

1015
01:07:29.96 --> 01:07:33.16
I know where they're going to step.

1016
01:07:33.16 --> 01:07:37.92
Particularly if there's a log for someone to have to go across, they'll always step around

1017
01:07:37.92 --> 01:07:39.52
the other side of it.

1018
01:07:39.52 --> 01:07:41.52
And that's where I'd put it.

1019
01:07:41.52 --> 01:07:44.56
I'd put it right where they're going to step and I'd cover it back up.

1020
01:07:44.56 --> 01:07:49.56
And sometimes I'd put my foot just a light foot print on top of it.

1021
01:07:49.56 --> 01:07:55.48
And if they came, you'd hear that thing go off and you knew you got one.

1022
01:07:55.48 --> 01:07:57.48
And he was probably going to die.

1023
01:07:57.48 --> 01:08:01.68
He believed to death because they didn't have hospital or anything out there.

1024
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:02.68
So you had him.

1025
01:08:02.68 --> 01:08:08.24
And if he was just leading a larger group, typically they would open fire.

1026
01:08:08.24 --> 01:08:09.40
They didn't know where you were.

1027
01:08:09.40 --> 01:08:11.40
They'd just start spraying the woods.

1028
01:08:11.40 --> 01:08:14.60
But you know, your way back here, they're in front of you now.

1029
01:08:14.60 --> 01:08:19.04
So that gives you a chance to decide if you're going to move out or not.

1030
01:08:19.04 --> 01:08:21.76
So anyway, we set up.

1031
01:08:21.76 --> 01:08:28.32
And the jungle, the jungle just swallows you as it starts to get dark.

1032
01:08:28.32 --> 01:08:32.36
It just closes then all around you.

1033
01:08:32.36 --> 01:08:38.08
And if you're under double canopy jungle, it gets dark fast.

1034
01:08:38.08 --> 01:08:41.36
If you're under triple, it's pretty dark during the daytime.

1035
01:08:41.36 --> 01:08:44.80
But at night, you can't see anything.

1036
01:08:44.80 --> 01:08:47.12
It's just totally dark.

1037
01:08:47.12 --> 01:08:55.88
And I was thinking, as it was getting dark, first I thought, how many little nervous

1038
01:08:55.88 --> 01:09:02.68
because I can't see, even though I had tremendous night vision, like an owl.

1039
01:09:02.68 --> 01:09:03.96
But I couldn't see.

1040
01:09:03.96 --> 01:09:07.36
And they can't see either.

1041
01:09:07.36 --> 01:09:12.92
And the difference is between us and them is we're not moving.

1042
01:09:12.92 --> 01:09:16.24
They have to move without making any noise.

1043
01:09:16.24 --> 01:09:18.04
If they make any noise, we know where they are.

1044
01:09:18.04 --> 01:09:19.84
We know they're out there.

1045
01:09:19.84 --> 01:09:28.80
So what I did was I created, for me, a 4D bubble around me.

1046
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:34.36
So I was just start with whatever direction I was facing.

1047
01:09:34.36 --> 01:09:37.12
And then what's out there?

1048
01:09:37.12 --> 01:09:38.24
What sounds do I hear?

1049
01:09:38.24 --> 01:09:39.52
What bugs do I hear?

1050
01:09:39.52 --> 01:09:41.52
What noises do I hear?

1051
01:09:41.52 --> 01:09:45.56
And I take a next quadrant and next quadrant until I've gone all the way around.

1052
01:09:45.56 --> 01:09:48.24
So I knew the sounds on all four quadrants.

1053
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:51.04
And then I would raise it up because up above you.

1054
01:09:51.04 --> 01:09:52.84
I mean, you've heard, you've got monkeys.

1055
01:09:52.84 --> 01:09:56.68
You've got different things that are happening in the trees, different sounds up there.

1056
01:09:56.68 --> 01:10:00.08
And you incorporate all this together.

1057
01:10:00.08 --> 01:10:06.56
And now you're used to a particular level of noise in each one of these quadrants.

1058
01:10:06.56 --> 01:10:11.92
And then the sound of silence was the trigger.

1059
01:10:11.92 --> 01:10:17.60
I devolved to where I could actually wake up.

1060
01:10:17.60 --> 01:10:22.60
If any quadrant went quiet, it would wake me up.

1061
01:10:22.60 --> 01:10:27.48
If anybody moves in one of those quadrants, the bugs in that area will stop choking.

1062
01:10:27.48 --> 01:10:29.08
They'll just get quiet all of a sudden.

1063
01:10:29.08 --> 01:10:33.08
And if they get quiet, something's out there.

1064
01:10:33.08 --> 01:10:36.56
And that'll work either, where they're coming from.

1065
01:10:36.56 --> 01:10:38.28
And it might be a tiger.

1066
01:10:38.28 --> 01:10:41.12
It might be some other, large animal.

1067
01:10:41.12 --> 01:10:44.80
But something just stopped them, scared them.

1068
01:10:44.80 --> 01:10:48.40
So I decided, the darts my friend, they can't see me.

1069
01:10:48.40 --> 01:10:52.64
And I've got area weapons out there, claymores.

1070
01:10:52.64 --> 01:10:55.20
I can set off the claymore.

1071
01:10:55.20 --> 01:10:56.48
They see a big ball of fire.

1072
01:10:56.48 --> 01:10:59.84
And I take out a bunch of people.

1073
01:10:59.84 --> 01:11:02.60
But they don't know where I am.

1074
01:11:02.60 --> 01:11:08.08
And then the next level of the fried grenades, they're grenades.

1075
01:11:08.08 --> 01:11:10.04
Big ball of fire, a lot of fragments.

1076
01:11:10.04 --> 01:11:11.40
But they don't know where they came from.

1077
01:11:11.40 --> 01:11:12.40
So they still don't see it.

1078
01:11:12.40 --> 01:11:16.64
As long as you don't pull the trigger on their weapon, they don't know where you are.

1079
01:11:16.64 --> 01:11:22.36
So I decided, this is pretty cool when it goes to art.

1080
01:11:22.36 --> 01:11:23.76
Yeah, that's all.

1081
01:11:23.76 --> 01:11:25.76
I'll find you if you're out there.

1082
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:28.48
How long would it take when you guys would settle into a perimeter?

1083
01:11:28.48 --> 01:11:34.88
How long would it take for the noise, the silence that you had created to escalate again

1084
01:11:34.88 --> 01:11:36.28
to normal jungle levels?

1085
01:11:36.28 --> 01:11:37.28
Within 30 minutes.

1086
01:11:37.28 --> 01:11:44.64
So once everybody's down and the rule was, once you're down you're down, you do not

1087
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:48.56
move again until morning.

1088
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:52.80
Because anybody moving is a bad guy.

1089
01:11:52.80 --> 01:12:00.92
And we would all position ourselves so that I could reach echo over here or the ground

1090
01:12:00.92 --> 01:12:07.92
the next side of me to wake him up or alert him something was happening.

1091
01:12:07.92 --> 01:12:10.16
Echoes are, I can't really do this.

1092
01:12:10.16 --> 01:12:16.84
But if I could have you armed, if you want to wake somebody up without terrifying them,

1093
01:12:16.84 --> 01:12:21.16
grab them right there and just slowly squeeze.

1094
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:25.08
And if you just slowly squeeze like that, what you'll see is their eyes start to open

1095
01:12:25.08 --> 01:12:28.24
up and they just come to you.

1096
01:12:28.24 --> 01:12:34.36
And we train to do that so people in you, if you get squeezed, you open your eyes.

1097
01:12:34.36 --> 01:12:36.92
That's the only thing you move, start listening.

1098
01:12:36.92 --> 01:12:39.28
What are you here?

1099
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:45.16
And it might be your turn to be on guard or it might be there's any me out here.

1100
01:12:45.16 --> 01:12:46.16
Yeah, that's crazy.

1101
01:12:46.16 --> 01:12:48.16
I just got you kicked in skin from that.

1102
01:12:48.16 --> 01:12:53.68
Well, I can only imagine like you feel that you're a crazy man.

1103
01:12:53.68 --> 01:12:58.24
How long would you guys do 50% security and 50% sleepin or do you guys do less than

1104
01:12:58.24 --> 01:12:59.60
actually really needed?

1105
01:12:59.60 --> 01:13:02.20
Yeah, sometimes we drop down to 30%.

1106
01:13:02.20 --> 01:13:09.52
But I mean, I know teams that everybody goes asleep, but not when they, I'm not going

1107
01:13:09.52 --> 01:13:10.52
there.

1108
01:13:10.52 --> 01:13:12.32
Somebody is going to be a white one here.

1109
01:13:12.32 --> 01:13:19.000
And sometimes you wouldn't sleep on top of it, you had to get off on the side and you

1110
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.72
try to get in a thick, you try to get in a steep area.

1111
01:13:22.72 --> 01:13:28.000
So you learn to sleep, straddle trees.

1112
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
So you straddle it.

1113
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So you want to slide on down to hill at night.

1114
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.40
It's a little uncomfortable at first.

1115
01:13:33.40 --> 01:13:40.32
You go, you get set up right, but once you do, you can sleep like that.

1116
01:13:40.32 --> 01:13:44.64
Keep your arms through your rucksack because you want to your rucksack to go with you.

1117
01:13:44.64 --> 01:13:50.12
If you had to leave in a hurry, your low bearing equipment never came off.

1118
01:13:50.12 --> 01:13:55.04
The weapon was always fast until you were a cord that went through a snap link on the

1119
01:13:55.04 --> 01:13:58.52
shoulder of your low bearing gear.

1120
01:13:58.52 --> 01:14:00.76
You'd have it laying across your lap.

1121
01:14:00.76 --> 01:14:06.04
So you could put your hands on it really easy and turn it and shoot it as you had to.

1122
01:14:06.04 --> 01:14:15.64
You had your knife where you could access that easily, quietly, in case you needed.

1123
01:14:15.64 --> 01:14:19.40
And then nobody moved.

1124
01:14:19.40 --> 01:14:24.76
And then that first overnight mission that you did, what was the purpose of the operation?

1125
01:14:24.76 --> 01:14:35.80
We were going to find us relatively small with tang and size element.

1126
01:14:35.80 --> 01:14:39.000
And there's how many of you guys?

1127
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.48
This mission is probably seven.

1128
01:14:40.48 --> 01:14:46.40
So there's seven of you looking for 500 enemy north Vietnamese regulars.

1129
01:14:46.40 --> 01:14:50.64
One of the things, I think, I know it sounds a little crazy.

1130
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:53.04
One of the things that you have to do is a lot crazy.

1131
01:14:53.04 --> 01:15:01.68
One of the things you have to understand about a sob team is a sob team for small, but

1132
01:15:01.68 --> 01:15:06.60
they carried a really big stick.

1133
01:15:06.60 --> 01:15:11.04
Given the stick might be 30 minutes away, where you could use it.

1134
01:15:11.04 --> 01:15:19.20
Sometimes on our, but man, you had a big stick because if you engage the enemy, as soon

1135
01:15:19.20 --> 01:15:26.32
as you transmitted the word peri-fire over the radio, everything flying within range of

1136
01:15:26.32 --> 01:15:29.56
that team was divided everything.

1137
01:15:29.56 --> 01:15:34.64
Any aircraft that had ordinance on any mission that was going on was set aside.

1138
01:15:34.64 --> 01:15:36.08
It all came to you.

1139
01:15:36.08 --> 01:15:37.80
It was unbelievable.

1140
01:15:37.80 --> 01:15:44.52
I had a mission one time where I had 14 covers in orbit waiting on their turn to come in

1141
01:15:44.52 --> 01:15:49.28
because I had to bring them in between the L-4s that were coming in and the sky readers

1142
01:15:49.28 --> 01:15:50.28
that were coming.

1143
01:15:50.28 --> 01:15:53.36
They were all, I mean, it was just unreal.

1144
01:15:53.36 --> 01:15:56.28
What would show up once you got in trouble?

1145
01:15:56.28 --> 01:15:59.24
Yes, that is the security blanket.

1146
01:15:59.24 --> 01:16:02.44
Although bad weather, then you're in trouble.

1147
01:16:02.44 --> 01:16:05.60
Night time?

1148
01:16:05.60 --> 01:16:12.36
You could do some at night time, but we didn't have the night vision.

1149
01:16:12.36 --> 01:16:15.76
The aircraft didn't have the technology that they have today.

1150
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:20.44
So, night time was a problem for them.

1151
01:16:20.44 --> 01:16:25.76
You could do something called combat sky spots where the L-4s could come in and drop

1152
01:16:25.76 --> 01:16:29.88
500 pound bombs, but they were doing it based on radar.

1153
01:16:29.88 --> 01:16:37.68
So, you had to start in like, 2500-3000 meters away and bring them in because you didn't

1154
01:16:37.68 --> 01:16:39.92
know where they were going to land.

1155
01:16:39.92 --> 01:16:46.000
They would be somewhere in that circle, but you had to let something hit and then start

1156
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
to work at some.

1157
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.40
The night time could be a problem.

1158
01:16:51.40 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah.

1159
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You got a book here.

1160
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You mentioned it really quickly.

1161
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.40
It's called the stress effect.

1162
01:16:58.40 --> 01:17:06.08
And it's about leadership and decision making, but you have some stories in it that

1163
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:07.08
are worth talking about.

1164
01:17:07.08 --> 01:17:10.44
I want to read one of them right now.

1165
01:17:10.44 --> 01:17:13.24
So it says, for almost two years, I had been training the lead of special operations

1166
01:17:13.24 --> 01:17:14.24
to even combat.

1167
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:18.04
During those two years, I had successfully completed the U.S. Army Ranger School of Special

1168
01:17:18.04 --> 01:17:21.72
Force, the training become a member of the most elite military force in the world.

1169
01:17:21.72 --> 01:17:26.12
When I got to base camp in Vietnam, 1968, I erected a six foot tall two-by-four board

1170
01:17:26.12 --> 01:17:31.28
in the dirt and wrapped hemp rope around the top eight inches of the board to provide a striking

1171
01:17:31.28 --> 01:17:33.32
surface.

1172
01:17:33.32 --> 01:17:37.20
Every day in camp, I pounded a striking pad with my fist and my feet, continuing to improve

1173
01:17:37.20 --> 01:17:38.96
my accuracy and power.

1174
01:17:38.96 --> 01:17:43.16
I had been trained in Ranger and Special Forces, a hand-to-hand combat, and it earned a

1175
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:45.84
black belt in the Korean martial art of Taekwondo.

1176
01:17:45.84 --> 01:17:51.64
I had become an expert with all special operations weapons as well.

1177
01:17:51.64 --> 01:17:52.88
I quickly found myself.

1178
01:17:52.88 --> 01:18:00.12
So you guys, you had some introduction to martial arts, and they were teaching you guys some

1179
01:18:00.12 --> 01:18:02.12
striking capability.

1180
01:18:02.12 --> 01:18:03.92
Did you guys learn any grappling at all?

1181
01:18:03.92 --> 01:18:04.92
Yeah.

1182
01:18:04.92 --> 01:18:10.32
I mean, you did that in Special Forces and in Ranger School, you did the military version

1183
01:18:10.32 --> 01:18:12.32
of the hand-to-hand.

1184
01:18:12.32 --> 01:18:19.000
But I had trained in Taekwondo when I was in college.

1185
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.68
I broke my hand when I did a little pub, and I thought there's got to be a record.

1186
01:18:24.68 --> 01:18:26.68
You're hand on a pub or?

1187
01:18:26.68 --> 01:18:27.68
No.

1188
01:18:27.68 --> 01:18:31.68
You broke your hand on a pub at a 10D.

1189
01:18:31.68 --> 01:18:38.64
There was an attendee that ran into my hand and broke it and I was thinking, there's

1190
01:18:38.64 --> 01:18:40.28
got to be a better way than this.

1191
01:18:40.28 --> 01:18:45.36
You know, I've seen the guys jumping around doing kung fu or whatever on movies.

1192
01:18:45.36 --> 01:18:52.64
So I found this Taekwondo place, you know, right off campus there, and I went in and

1193
01:18:52.64 --> 01:18:55.52
I said, you know, I need to help him up a little bit.

1194
01:18:55.52 --> 01:18:57.48
I'm tired of getting hurt.

1195
01:18:57.48 --> 01:18:58.48
So.

1196
01:18:58.48 --> 01:18:59.48
Right on.

1197
01:18:59.48 --> 01:19:04.20
Back to the book, I quickly found myself deep inside enemy territory leading my elite team

1198
01:19:04.20 --> 01:19:07.92
of three Americans in four mercenaries on a classified mission.

1199
01:19:07.92 --> 01:19:10.96
Every human within a hundred miles was the enemy.

1200
01:19:10.96 --> 01:19:12.36
The temperature was 110 degrees.

1201
01:19:12.36 --> 01:19:13.96
The humidity was 100%.

1202
01:19:13.96 --> 01:19:17.76
The salt from our own perspiration constantly burned our eyes.

1203
01:19:17.76 --> 01:19:19.24
Mesquitos swarmed.

1204
01:19:19.24 --> 01:19:24.000
Each of us carried 35 to 40 pounds of ammunition grenades and water on our loadbork bearing

1205
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.08
harness and a 75 pound rucksack on our back.

1206
01:19:28.08 --> 01:19:32.16
No one wore an armored vest or helmet because these would add too much extra weight and

1207
01:19:32.16 --> 01:19:33.28
would be too hot.

1208
01:19:33.28 --> 01:19:36.96
We were operating under triple canopy jungle that allowed very little light to come

1209
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:38.60
through and no air movement.

1210
01:19:38.60 --> 01:19:39.76
It rained every day.

1211
01:19:39.76 --> 01:19:40.96
Everything was wet.

1212
01:19:40.96 --> 01:19:44.32
The bushes in the ground recovered with small leeches that began to move up and down

1213
01:19:44.32 --> 01:19:48.44
frantically when they sensed our body heat thinking they would have a meal soon.

1214
01:19:48.44 --> 01:19:50.96
They attached themselves to us without our noticing them.

1215
01:19:50.96 --> 01:19:55.60
The next day we would find them our faces, chest arms and legs filled with blood and

1216
01:19:55.60 --> 01:19:59.32
the size of our the end being the size of our thumbs.

1217
01:19:59.32 --> 01:20:01.48
The physical and mental stress was very high.

1218
01:20:01.48 --> 01:20:03.76
This type of mission required complete silence.

1219
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:07.48
No talking for days just hand in arm signals or notes.

1220
01:20:07.48 --> 01:20:10.56
There could be absolutely no noise while moving.

1221
01:20:10.56 --> 01:20:16.32
We were traveling along at a snail's pace of 100 yards an hour.

1222
01:20:16.32 --> 01:20:19.56
Every step in every foot placement were pre-planned.

1223
01:20:19.56 --> 01:20:21.80
Toad down first then slowly the heel.

1224
01:20:21.80 --> 01:20:25.84
This technique was designed to muffle the noise of any small branches that might be broken

1225
01:20:25.84 --> 01:20:28.72
if we accidentally placed our weight on them.

1226
01:20:28.72 --> 01:20:32.88
Each team member had an area of responsibility for maintaining vigilance as we moved.

1227
01:20:32.88 --> 01:20:36.92
We were always looking for booby traps and versus enemy personnel poisonous snakes and

1228
01:20:36.92 --> 01:20:38.48
tigers.

1229
01:20:38.48 --> 01:20:42.16
We couldn't forget the 500 pound hungry tigers.

1230
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:46.04
We knew a North Vietnamese army force was very close to us.

1231
01:20:46.04 --> 01:20:47.36
We just didn't know exactly where.

1232
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:50.80
We spent most of the day moving up to the top of a ridge one step at a time without making

1233
01:20:50.80 --> 01:20:52.12
a sound.

1234
01:20:52.12 --> 01:20:56.48
Just as we neared the top the point man signal to us to halt to get down.

1235
01:20:56.48 --> 01:20:59.32
You could hear a large group of enemy soldiers just over the ridge.

1236
01:20:59.32 --> 01:21:02.08
Our hearts began to race and a general in spite.

1237
01:21:02.08 --> 01:21:06.48
Our seven-man team was about to come face to face with over 180 trained North Vietnamese

1238
01:21:06.48 --> 01:21:08.40
army soldiers.

1239
01:21:08.40 --> 01:21:11.68
Our stress level sort and our attention became focused.

1240
01:21:11.68 --> 01:21:16.40
We knew everything we could literally explode at any second.

1241
01:21:16.40 --> 01:21:18.40
The closest help was an hour away.

1242
01:21:18.40 --> 01:21:21.52
We could make no mistakes and we could not be discovered.

1243
01:21:21.52 --> 01:21:25.36
I moved forward into a position to observe the enemy soldiers who were less than 40 yards

1244
01:21:25.36 --> 01:21:28.24
down the other side of the ridge from our location.

1245
01:21:28.24 --> 01:21:31.96
They appeared to have finished eating and were getting ready to move up the ridge towards

1246
01:21:31.96 --> 01:21:32.96
our location.

1247
01:21:32.96 --> 01:21:36.76
I singled the team that we needed to move quickly.

1248
01:21:36.76 --> 01:21:40.32
Although the ground was muddy, slippery and steep, we tried to move as quickly and quietly

1249
01:21:40.32 --> 01:21:41.32
as possible.

1250
01:21:41.32 --> 01:21:46.000
It was going to be very difficult to avoid contact with them and contact would be deadly.

1251
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.84
I was about 20 feet behind the point man, moving deliberately, tightly gripping the handle

1252
01:21:50.84 --> 01:21:55.48
of my car 15 machine gun with my right hand while using my left hand to steady myself

1253
01:21:55.48 --> 01:21:57.80
by grabbing bushes as I moved.

1254
01:21:57.80 --> 01:22:04.24
It started to rain hard, making it even more difficult to get us help if we were discovered.

1255
01:22:04.24 --> 01:22:08.96
We could hear the enemy talking on the other side of the ridge.

1256
01:22:08.96 --> 01:22:13.40
Then out of nowhere, I was hit so hard from the high side of the ridge that my weapon was

1257
01:22:13.40 --> 01:22:18.52
knocked out of my hand and my feet left the ground and I was falling backward down the

1258
01:22:18.52 --> 01:22:20.12
side of the steep ridge.

1259
01:22:20.12 --> 01:22:25.000
Instinctively, I grabbed my attacker as I fell and took him with me.

1260
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.08
My stress level was so high that all my hand to hand combat training automatically kicked

1261
01:22:29.08 --> 01:22:30.08
in.

1262
01:22:30.08 --> 01:22:34.08
I pulled down the inkline and the rain and mud, I literally ripped my attacker limb from

1263
01:22:34.08 --> 01:22:37.84
limb, biting, pulling and breaking any part I could get my hands on.

1264
01:22:37.84 --> 01:22:43.84
I used to every deadly move I knew and actually heard the sounds of bones breaking.

1265
01:22:43.84 --> 01:22:47.92
Although the entire event lasted only a few seconds, it appeared to pass in slow motion,

1266
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:51.20
a stream of thoughts and questions went through my mind.

1267
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:52.56
Where did this guy come from?

1268
01:22:52.56 --> 01:22:53.88
How did I miss seeing him?

1269
01:22:53.88 --> 01:22:54.88
Does he have a knife?

1270
01:22:54.88 --> 01:22:55.88
How can I get my knife?

1271
01:22:55.88 --> 01:22:56.88
Is he alone?

1272
01:22:56.88 --> 01:23:00.000
Will he call his comrades before I can silence him?

1273
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.16
And it was over as quickly as it began.

1274
01:23:02.16 --> 01:23:07.08
We were wedged hard against a large tree that stopped our tumble down the ridge.

1275
01:23:07.08 --> 01:23:10.24
The impact momentarily knocked the breath out of me.

1276
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:12.76
The attacker was not moving.

1277
01:23:12.76 --> 01:23:15.68
Apparently I was the winner.

1278
01:23:15.68 --> 01:23:19.24
All my hand to hand combat training had paid off.

1279
01:23:19.24 --> 01:23:23.64
Looking up the ridge, I saw some of my team members looking down at me with sheer horror

1280
01:23:23.64 --> 01:23:26.000
and shock on their faces.

1281
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.96
It must have been almost as terrifying for them as it was for me I thought.

1282
01:23:29.96 --> 01:23:33.000
Everyone's life hung in the balance but I had won the fight.

1283
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.20
Mano, E Mano.

1284
01:23:35.20 --> 01:23:37.72
I had saved the team.

1285
01:23:37.72 --> 01:23:44.44
As I begin to untangle myself from my attacker, the world suddenly came back into focus.

1286
01:23:44.44 --> 01:23:48.56
Now I had the same horror and shock on my face as my team members did.

1287
01:23:48.56 --> 01:23:56.48
I had just used all my expert hand to hand combat techniques on a banana tree.

1288
01:23:56.48 --> 01:24:00.12
And that part of the world warms, eat around the bottom of the banana trees which weakens

1289
01:24:00.12 --> 01:24:02.48
them and cause them to fall without warning.

1290
01:24:02.48 --> 01:24:06.80
I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and be blindsided by a falling

1291
01:24:06.80 --> 01:24:08.44
banana tree.

1292
01:24:08.44 --> 01:24:12.16
Fortunately, two components to this event ultimately saved us.

1293
01:24:12.16 --> 01:24:15.92
First I was hit so hard and unexpectedly that my weapon was knocked out of my hand preventing

1294
01:24:15.92 --> 01:24:19.24
me from firing at the tree and giving away our position.

1295
01:24:19.24 --> 01:24:23.36
Second it was raining so hard that the enemy soldiers did not notice the commotion.

1296
01:24:23.36 --> 01:24:28.72
We completed our mission and returned to Vietnam unharmed except from my ego.

1297
01:24:28.72 --> 01:24:33.88
I have heard however that banana trees in that part of the world still tremble at the

1298
01:24:33.88 --> 01:24:36.88
mention of my name.

1299
01:24:36.88 --> 01:24:41.08
Good times.

1300
01:24:41.08 --> 01:24:43.08
A little embarrassing.

1301
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:48.44
But yeah, it was stress level was so high.

1302
01:24:48.44 --> 01:24:54.20
It was just you're locked loaded, you're ready to go and something triggers you and you

1303
01:24:54.20 --> 01:24:55.20
go for it.

1304
01:24:55.20 --> 01:24:56.20
You react.

1305
01:24:56.20 --> 01:24:59.20
It was just the instinct.

1306
01:24:59.20 --> 01:25:02.36
Somebody had me and it was me or him.

1307
01:25:02.36 --> 01:25:11.56
I just unleashed everything I still had until I killed a banana tree.

1308
01:25:11.56 --> 01:25:15.76
Yeah, I can walk by one today even in other countries than the tremble.

1309
01:25:15.76 --> 01:25:16.76
They know.

1310
01:25:16.76 --> 01:25:17.76
They know.

1311
01:25:17.76 --> 01:25:18.76
They know.

1312
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:24.000
You can see the little lounge turn and watch me to make sure I go on by.

1313
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
It is amazing.

1314
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.48
The point of you telling that story, talking about stress and I want that I noticed about

1315
01:25:30.48 --> 01:25:35.76
it is when we are anticipating something.

1316
01:25:35.76 --> 01:25:40.56
Oftentimes we will see what we are anticipating.

1317
01:25:40.56 --> 01:25:46.000
When we are predicting enemy combat, then that's what we are going to see.

1318
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.12
You have another great vignette in here about a shooting that took place in New York.

1319
01:25:52.12 --> 01:25:58.24
It was a guy that was standing in the stoop of a doorway and the police officer CM and

1320
01:25:58.24 --> 01:26:06.12
he looked kind of suspicious and eventually when he moved, they said, oh, he's trying to run

1321
01:26:06.12 --> 01:26:07.12
from us.

1322
01:26:07.12 --> 01:26:11.12
Now they draw their weapons and the next thing he does is reach into his pocket.

1323
01:26:11.12 --> 01:26:15.24
They start shooting and once one person starts shooting, they all start shooting and they

1324
01:26:15.24 --> 01:26:24.48
end up putting 40 plus rounds into the guy and into the shoot very accurately.

1325
01:26:24.48 --> 01:26:31.48
But it turns out that the guy was just a normal citizen that fit the description of the

1326
01:26:31.48 --> 01:26:37.60
description of a person that had conducted some crimes in the area.

1327
01:26:37.60 --> 01:26:40.20
It wasn't like a specific description.

1328
01:26:40.20 --> 01:26:43.20
I think it was like a black guy in this neighborhood.

1329
01:26:43.20 --> 01:26:45.40
Oh, looks pretty close.

1330
01:26:45.40 --> 01:26:52.24
What they anticipated seeing and what they got kind of mentally ready for and then he

1331
01:26:52.24 --> 01:26:55.000
makes a move to get away from them.

1332
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.28
In their mind, he's making a move to get away from them.

1333
01:26:57.28 --> 01:27:00.12
In his mind, he's just trying to get out of the way who knows what these cops are doing,

1334
01:27:00.12 --> 01:27:02.52
but they can't be after me.

1335
01:27:02.52 --> 01:27:06.44
And then the next thing is they're yelling at him, oh, I better get them some ID.

1336
01:27:06.44 --> 01:27:08.12
So he reaches into his pocket.

1337
01:27:08.12 --> 01:27:09.48
What do they think he's reaching for?

1338
01:27:09.48 --> 01:27:11.84
They're anticipating he's reaching for a weapon.

1339
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:13.24
So they kill him.

1340
01:27:13.24 --> 01:27:18.92
So that's a great lesson learned and you know, you talk a lot in the book, the stress

1341
01:27:18.92 --> 01:27:23.08
effect about you call it awareness being aware of what's going on.

1342
01:27:23.08 --> 01:27:29.56
I always use the word detachment being detached from all the chaos and emotion and what

1343
01:27:29.56 --> 01:27:33.56
a great power it is to have that, you know, it's the same word or different word, same

1344
01:27:33.56 --> 01:27:37.76
meaning, the awareness that you talk about, but that example right there, what you're

1345
01:27:37.76 --> 01:27:38.92
anticipating.

1346
01:27:38.92 --> 01:27:42.96
There's a good chance that what you're anticipating, you're going to see, you're going to

1347
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:45.20
see reading the numbers of what reality is.

1348
01:27:45.20 --> 01:27:47.20
Yeah, it's not a banana trace.

1349
01:27:47.20 --> 01:27:53.36
No, I've been to me soldier, highly trained in scale and he's trying to take me out and

1350
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:55.32
doing a good job because I'm falling backwards.

1351
01:27:55.32 --> 01:27:57.04
I can't shoot him.

1352
01:27:57.04 --> 01:28:04.04
Yeah, I mean in the story you're talking about is a approaching and start shooting, you

1353
01:28:04.04 --> 01:28:12.48
know, the first two guys to get the get there, one start shooting and what happens is some

1354
01:28:12.48 --> 01:28:18.68
of the bullets are hitting on different parts of the stoop and start to ricochet back.

1355
01:28:18.68 --> 01:28:19.68
That's right.

1356
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:21.08
In their mind, he's shooting at him.

1357
01:28:21.08 --> 01:28:24.48
I mean the bullets that come in back out of him, but you think he's shooting, the other

1358
01:28:24.48 --> 01:28:28.28
guy with him trips on the steps and falls.

1359
01:28:28.28 --> 01:28:32.64
So his partners think, man, they hit him, he's down, the other two were up there, they

1360
01:28:32.64 --> 01:28:40.000
think he's down and they all just continue to shoot and innocent guy.

1361
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.36
So we see what we're expecting.

1362
01:28:42.36 --> 01:28:47.80
I have to be careful with that and it happens all the time.

1363
01:28:47.80 --> 01:28:54.40
I've went to adrenaline starts flowing, you're going to do a lot of things that you need

1364
01:28:54.40 --> 01:28:58.68
to keep it under control and there's a part of it.

1365
01:28:58.68 --> 01:29:00.68
Probably get an off track here.

1366
01:29:00.68 --> 01:29:07.08
Some of it is practice, practice, practice, go through the immediate action, do what you

1367
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:09.68
keep doing it and doing it and doing it.

1368
01:29:09.68 --> 01:29:17.60
One of the things I used to make my guys practice that they really didn't like was when

1369
01:29:17.60 --> 01:29:22.72
we were going on mission because you're going to be out there for so long.

1370
01:29:22.72 --> 01:29:28.12
The one zero cared of medical kit, so I'd have a medical kit with me.

1371
01:29:28.12 --> 01:29:35.92
Everyone there cared, came in a can back then just a little can about that bigger round.

1372
01:29:35.92 --> 01:29:40.28
You had it taped on the back of your web gear and had a bag of ringer solution and

1373
01:29:40.28 --> 01:29:42.28
a blood expander.

1374
01:29:42.28 --> 01:29:50.20
Because when you get hit, most of the time what you die of from a gunshot is you believe

1375
01:29:50.20 --> 01:29:51.20
that they're there.

1376
01:29:51.20 --> 01:29:55.52
You can't get the bloods stopped in time.

1377
01:29:55.52 --> 01:30:02.48
We all care a bag of ringer solution so you could get an IV right there on the spot.

1378
01:30:02.48 --> 01:30:08.04
My thinking was, especially after that first incident when I had a trouble getting the magazine

1379
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:12.24
and the weapon, I don't want one of my guys trying to put that needle in.

1380
01:30:12.24 --> 01:30:17.56
In that condition, and he's jabbing all over my arm and I'm laying there bleeding the

1381
01:30:17.56 --> 01:30:18.56
death.

1382
01:30:18.56 --> 01:30:21.16
I need to blood so I said, okay guys, he's all we're going to do.

1383
01:30:21.16 --> 01:30:23.16
We have a little practice.

1384
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:29.04
So I had been over to the dispensary and I had gotten some needles and I brought him over

1385
01:30:29.04 --> 01:30:33.88
and I said, we're going to practice putting the needle in each other.

1386
01:30:33.88 --> 01:30:36.16
So we're getting shot out.

1387
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:37.16
You've done it before.

1388
01:30:37.16 --> 01:30:41.36
You don't need to first time that you tried to put a needle in the vein, they did not

1389
01:30:41.36 --> 01:30:42.36
like that.

1390
01:30:42.36 --> 01:30:45.08
Like guys, okay, now swap partners.

1391
01:30:45.08 --> 01:30:47.08
Let's do it again.

1392
01:30:47.08 --> 01:30:49.96
And every so often we would go through that drill.

1393
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:50.96
Let's practice.

1394
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:53.36
Let's practice opening and again.

1395
01:30:53.36 --> 01:30:57.36
You don't want to have never tried to open that can before when somebody is shooting at

1396
01:30:57.36 --> 01:30:58.36
you.

1397
01:30:58.36 --> 01:31:00.04
And your buddy is bleeding the death.

1398
01:31:00.04 --> 01:31:02.64
You have to have been through the whole process.

1399
01:31:02.64 --> 01:31:03.64
Let's do it.

1400
01:31:03.64 --> 01:31:08.20
Well, these lessons that you learned that you passed on, I mean everything from, you

1401
01:31:08.20 --> 01:31:11.56
know, getting on the ground and patrolling a hundred meters and then waiting.

1402
01:31:11.56 --> 01:31:13.08
That's what we were trying.

1403
01:31:13.08 --> 01:31:15.96
Now, I will say that once you got night vision things are different because you didn't

1404
01:31:15.96 --> 01:31:18.20
need to wait half an hour to let your night vision adjust.

1405
01:31:18.20 --> 01:31:20.04
You could go.

1406
01:31:20.04 --> 01:31:22.000
But, you know, we used to do the same thing.

1407
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.76
We used to get give each other IVs with red lens flashlights at night underneath the

1408
01:31:25.76 --> 01:31:28.84
poncho because that's what you're going to have to do.

1409
01:31:28.84 --> 01:31:32.32
And so those are the kind of things that you have to train.

1410
01:31:32.32 --> 01:31:39.32
And people that think that that horrible thought that creeps in your mind that well

1411
01:31:39.32 --> 01:31:43.92
when the time rises, when the time arises, all of all know what to do.

1412
01:31:43.92 --> 01:31:46.12
That is not the truth right there.

1413
01:31:46.12 --> 01:31:48.32
I got a quick question for you.

1414
01:31:48.32 --> 01:31:49.92
How did you get the name dynamite?

1415
01:31:49.92 --> 01:31:52.20
Was that your nickname to day assigned that to you?

1416
01:31:52.20 --> 01:31:56.20
Because I'm surprised at this point your nickname wasn't banana tree.

1417
01:31:56.20 --> 01:32:03.20
Fortunately, you got your code name on day one.

1418
01:32:03.20 --> 01:32:10.000
After we got the briefing, the name, and then we had to select a code name.

1419
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.60
I wanted Ranger.

1420
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:14.32
Ranger was already taken.

1421
01:32:14.32 --> 01:32:17.20
So they said here are some others.

1422
01:32:17.20 --> 01:32:23.20
I saw dynamite and I said, you know, I really do like the blow things up.

1423
01:32:23.20 --> 01:32:29.20
I'm small and you know, dynamite probably works for me.

1424
01:32:29.20 --> 01:32:33.56
I believe my neighbors went to Zout when there was a teenager one time with a rocket to

1425
01:32:33.56 --> 01:32:37.000
explode it on my launch pad.

1426
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.28
I didn't intend for that to happen.

1427
01:32:39.28 --> 01:32:42.44
But yeah, I was always blowing things up.

1428
01:32:42.44 --> 01:32:48.56
And then when I was there in Southeast Asia, I believe things up all the time.

1429
01:32:48.56 --> 01:32:51.52
I believe Virges up, I believe, all kinds of things.

1430
01:32:51.52 --> 01:32:55.04
And I always cared a lot of demo with me.

1431
01:32:55.04 --> 01:32:57.32
Good nickname.

1432
01:32:57.32 --> 01:33:00.12
And that was your call sign too, was that your call sign when you're in the field?

1433
01:33:00.12 --> 01:33:01.12
No, no.

1434
01:33:01.12 --> 01:33:07.08
No, and well, it would be my call sign if I was wounded or something like that.

1435
01:33:07.08 --> 01:33:11.56
But call signs that we use are always three letter groups.

1436
01:33:11.56 --> 01:33:13.56
Okay, got them.

1437
01:33:13.56 --> 01:33:19.68
All right, you mentioned in your notes here that you gave me an off where you guys hit with,

1438
01:33:19.68 --> 01:33:21.72
you guys got hit with gas.

1439
01:33:21.72 --> 01:33:24.32
Yeah, that was, that had to be unexpected.

1440
01:33:24.32 --> 01:33:26.68
That was still with Dex team.

1441
01:33:26.68 --> 01:33:33.56
Yeah, we had planned and rehearsed for everything.

1442
01:33:33.56 --> 01:33:34.96
We went in.

1443
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:37.12
It was on the hotelsy or didn't appear to be.

1444
01:33:37.12 --> 01:33:39.92
We didn't throw any fire going in.

1445
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:45.12
We got off the aircraft, the aircraft, you know, took off.

1446
01:33:45.12 --> 01:33:49.36
We're on the ground and all of a sudden, you know, we couldn't see.

1447
01:33:49.36 --> 01:33:50.88
You couldn't breathe.

1448
01:33:50.88 --> 01:33:56.52
This stuff is coming across the LZ and, you know, we're coughing in Gagin because we didn't

1449
01:33:56.52 --> 01:33:58.80
have masks with us.

1450
01:33:58.80 --> 01:34:02.04
Mask, we're like helmets and plankbakers.

1451
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:05.56
That's extra waste you got to carry.

1452
01:34:05.56 --> 01:34:11.72
And unless we were intended to use gas, we didn't carry it because it was just very, very

1453
01:34:11.72 --> 01:34:16.12
rare that the NVA would use gas.

1454
01:34:16.12 --> 01:34:20.12
In this case, we're on LZ, here comes the gas.

1455
01:34:20.12 --> 01:34:21.36
We're not prepared for it.

1456
01:34:21.36 --> 01:34:25.80
We had to call, you know, for the aircraft to come back and get us out.

1457
01:34:25.80 --> 01:34:28.20
It creates a real problem for pilots.

1458
01:34:28.20 --> 01:34:33.56
If they, if they don't have masks, and now all of a sudden they're getting all of the

1459
01:34:33.56 --> 01:34:37.60
the gas coming in, you know, it's hard for them to see the instrument panel to be able to

1460
01:34:37.60 --> 01:34:41.56
fly, you know, what they came back in and they got us out.

1461
01:34:41.56 --> 01:34:44.88
It was, it wasn't a pleasant experience.

1462
01:34:44.88 --> 01:34:48.12
And it was one of those things we didn't plan for it.

1463
01:34:48.12 --> 01:34:52.80
You know, because it was such a rarity, we just didn't do it.

1464
01:34:52.80 --> 01:34:57.24
I was surprised we went through a gear list with tilt and they always carry the gas mask.

1465
01:34:57.24 --> 01:35:00.000
And of course, because they always carry the gas mask, you know how many times they came

1466
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.28
across, they think the number was zero.

1467
01:35:02.28 --> 01:35:03.28
Murphy's law.

1468
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:04.28
Yeah.

1469
01:35:04.28 --> 01:35:13.64
You know, a lot of times we would carry gas, we'd carry regular, you know, like a CS grenade.

1470
01:35:13.64 --> 01:35:19.56
The CS grenade, but we'd also carry the CS rounds for the M49, the 40 millimeter.

1471
01:35:19.56 --> 01:35:20.56
So we could shoot those.

1472
01:35:20.56 --> 01:35:28.60
But if we carried, I've CS or are the grenades, then, you know, we carried the mask too.

1473
01:35:28.60 --> 01:35:33.32
But it was the mass, because we were going to use them.

1474
01:35:33.32 --> 01:35:36.16
And, you know, if you use gas, you better have a mask.

1475
01:35:36.16 --> 01:35:39.92
Are you going to use bad off as the other gas goes without fail?

1476
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:41.32
The wind's going to change.

1477
01:35:41.32 --> 01:35:45.12
And it's got got right back on you and your interval.

1478
01:35:45.12 --> 01:35:47.24
Murphy's law.

1479
01:35:47.24 --> 01:35:50.92
You got another note and hear about a mission.

1480
01:35:50.92 --> 01:35:54.08
It says tree roots.

1481
01:35:54.08 --> 01:36:03.76
And this was, I think this, this was my last mission with RT Alabama, with, with, with deck.

1482
01:36:03.76 --> 01:36:07.20
And we had gone up, we made a little fish hook, we came back.

1483
01:36:07.20 --> 01:36:09.52
It was early afternoon.

1484
01:36:09.52 --> 01:36:12.64
We were going to take a break for a little while.

1485
01:36:12.64 --> 01:36:17.48
So we had put that, the clay mowers, I had put a toe pop around.

1486
01:36:17.48 --> 01:36:21.28
And there were some strange trees in that area.

1487
01:36:21.28 --> 01:36:29.000
I'm still not sure what they were called, but they almost looked like rockets with fins.

1488
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.72
The roots kind of came out.

1489
01:36:30.72 --> 01:36:35.88
I mean, you know, they grow up the tree, maybe two feet or so.

1490
01:36:35.88 --> 01:36:39.68
And they'd come out like fins all the way around.

1491
01:36:39.68 --> 01:36:40.68
So we were taking a break.

1492
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:47.96
So I thought, yeah, I'll just lay down between, you know, these roots.

1493
01:36:47.96 --> 01:36:52.44
And, you know, you won't be able to see me because I'm kind of down in there.

1494
01:36:52.44 --> 01:36:55.52
And that's where I'll take my break.

1495
01:36:55.52 --> 01:36:59.000
And then we hear the toe popper go off.

1496
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.64
I hear that loud scream.

1497
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:07.20
And seeing as a toe popper went off, it just was a garage of AK 47-fire coming.

1498
01:37:07.20 --> 01:37:10.32
Some of it, you know, in higher directions, some of it in other directions.

1499
01:37:10.32 --> 01:37:12.76
They didn't know exactly where you were.

1500
01:37:12.76 --> 01:37:20.96
But in that first garage coming through, I had three AK rounds come through the root on my left side.

1501
01:37:20.96 --> 01:37:24.32
Right across my shirt, I had just exhale.

1502
01:37:24.32 --> 01:37:29.76
And through the root on the other side, if I had just inhale, it would take in the

1503
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:31.64
top of my chest off when it came by.

1504
01:37:31.64 --> 01:37:39.48
So it just grays me, you know, coming across and I'd probably see a get out of here.

1505
01:37:39.48 --> 01:37:45.08
So I got the roots or not providing any, you know, actual cover forming just a little

1506
01:37:45.08 --> 01:37:46.08
concealment.

1507
01:37:46.08 --> 01:37:50.44
So I jumped around behind the tree and, you know, we set off to clay moors, had a full

1508
01:37:50.44 --> 01:37:56.000
of ledge, you know, a firefight going on, eventually had to work gunshilts and things

1509
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.80
and get extracted.

1510
01:37:59.80 --> 01:38:06.16
One of the things that I also did was, got another taste of the impact of adrenaline.

1511
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:12.72
Because when I came out from behind the tree, I had taken my arms out of the straps on the

1512
01:38:12.72 --> 01:38:13.72
rucksack.

1513
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:16.68
So I had to grab it with my hand.

1514
01:38:16.68 --> 01:38:18.32
I grabbed it with my left hand.

1515
01:38:18.32 --> 01:38:20.92
You know, it weighed probably 75 pounds.

1516
01:38:20.92 --> 01:38:29.84
But I'm not a big guy, but I'm tossing that 75 pound rucksack around like it's a pillow.

1517
01:38:29.84 --> 01:38:35.12
And, you know, it's going to go with me as we fight our way down the ridge and toward the

1518
01:38:35.12 --> 01:38:37.56
OZ.

1519
01:38:37.56 --> 01:38:41.84
But I paid for it, you know, later on, you know, I actually got extracted and it realized

1520
01:38:41.84 --> 01:38:44.68
I had pulled muscles in my shoulders.

1521
01:38:44.68 --> 01:38:48.12
Because I'm muscle, so I'm just trying to handle that much weight.

1522
01:38:48.12 --> 01:38:52.16
I had so much adrenaline pumping, pumping through my system then.

1523
01:38:52.16 --> 01:38:53.16
Yeah.

1524
01:38:53.16 --> 01:38:57.20
So as soon as you guys get contacted, as soon as that those rounds start coming, you're

1525
01:38:57.20 --> 01:38:59.16
calling prayer and fire emergency.

1526
01:38:59.16 --> 01:39:00.16
Prayer fire.

1527
01:39:00.16 --> 01:39:05.80
And then how long is it taken before aircraft show up on station?

1528
01:39:05.80 --> 01:39:10.36
Usually you'll have something within 30 minutes that you might be able to work against

1529
01:39:10.36 --> 01:39:11.52
you for something like that.

1530
01:39:11.52 --> 01:39:17.44
But for the extraction ships, it might be an hour depending on how far in there you are.

1531
01:39:17.44 --> 01:39:20.20
And it might be longer than that.

1532
01:39:20.20 --> 01:39:24.000
But if you had bad weather, nobody's coming.

1533
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.44
I think I say, you know, they can't find you.

1534
01:39:27.44 --> 01:39:31.16
How good was the weather prediction at that time?

1535
01:39:31.16 --> 01:39:33.96
You know, if you guys, were you guys able to look out in a day and say, okay, there's

1536
01:39:33.96 --> 01:39:37.08
that there's going to be storms moving through here tomorrow?

1537
01:39:37.08 --> 01:39:45.36
We, at the different CNCs, we had our own Air Force meteorologist that tracked a weather

1538
01:39:45.36 --> 01:39:51.48
briefing and gave a weather briefing to a three times a day, you know, to the command group.

1539
01:39:51.48 --> 01:39:52.48
The teams would get them.

1540
01:39:52.48 --> 01:39:59.16
We would get them before we would go out so that we would know what to expect.

1541
01:39:59.16 --> 01:40:03.48
And, you know, we didn't launch unless the weather looked like it was going to be good.

1542
01:40:03.48 --> 01:40:07.44
You know, for the insertion, because you didn't want to get out there and all of a sudden,

1543
01:40:07.44 --> 01:40:10.80
you couldn't use the assets that you had with it.

1544
01:40:10.80 --> 01:40:17.40
So, but still, it's kind of like today, the best weather predictions that are made by

1545
01:40:17.40 --> 01:40:22.60
the ones that day after, you know, we can tell you what probably happened yesterday or at

1546
01:40:22.60 --> 01:40:26.92
least with a high probability of what happened yesterday.

1547
01:40:26.92 --> 01:40:32.74
But the weather change, you know, it's where we were northmost of the time, it was a rain

1548
01:40:32.74 --> 01:40:33.74
forest.

1549
01:40:33.74 --> 01:40:35.74
I mean, it's got rain.

1550
01:40:35.74 --> 01:40:36.74
It's going to rain.

1551
01:40:36.74 --> 01:40:45.90
And the clouds would roll right down on top of the mountain and just totally conceal it,

1552
01:40:45.90 --> 01:40:46.90
conceal the reslines.

1553
01:40:46.90 --> 01:40:51.02
So, not only are you under triple canopy jungle, a lot.

1554
01:40:51.02 --> 01:40:53.78
Now, you've got a cloud cover over it.

1555
01:40:53.78 --> 01:40:58.34
I mean, up above that, they can see fine, but they can't see where you are.

1556
01:40:58.34 --> 01:41:01.06
They can't, you know, fire the flare out.

1557
01:41:01.06 --> 01:41:05.18
They won't see them because they're in the clouds.

1558
01:41:05.18 --> 01:41:11.94
Is it always the one zero that's carrying the radio and talking to the aircraft or who

1559
01:41:11.94 --> 01:41:13.26
usually was doing that for you?

1560
01:41:13.26 --> 01:41:15.38
I know that tilt said he did it.

1561
01:41:15.38 --> 01:41:18.78
He would be like, yep, I'm going to talk to the aircraft.

1562
01:41:18.78 --> 01:41:20.74
Most of the time, I carried the radio.

1563
01:41:20.74 --> 01:41:25.86
I mean, you had, you had a guy, you know, one of the three Americans was supposed to be

1564
01:41:25.86 --> 01:41:28.86
carrying the radio.

1565
01:41:28.86 --> 01:41:37.50
Usually the one two, if you had a one two, but I carried mine almost all the time.

1566
01:41:37.50 --> 01:41:39.90
But even if I didn't carry it, I wanted to talk.

1567
01:41:39.90 --> 01:41:46.26
So, bringing it over here, I want to tell them what I need to have done.

1568
01:41:46.26 --> 01:41:52.86
So, you know, that gave me another 25 pounds plus depending on how many batteries I carried.

1569
01:41:52.86 --> 01:41:55.26
More weight to go in my rucksack.

1570
01:41:55.26 --> 01:42:00.70
And that's if we used, you know, the PRC 25 or 701.

1571
01:42:00.70 --> 01:42:09.02
But I think tilt mentioned that one point we had a commander take over CCN who said,

1572
01:42:09.02 --> 01:42:18.78
you're going to carry the KY38, a secure radio, which, you know, the PRC 701 was about 25

1573
01:42:18.78 --> 01:42:28.02
pounds, and then it had to connect into the KY38, which was the same square.

1574
01:42:28.02 --> 01:42:32.78
But thicker, you know, and they had to fasten together.

1575
01:42:32.78 --> 01:42:37.34
So, some people would stack up on a rucksack one under the other.

1576
01:42:37.34 --> 01:42:45.42
Most people were wearing 77 in the back and 38 in the front to help you balance, you know,

1577
01:42:45.42 --> 01:42:48.14
going up and down the heels and getting theory.

1578
01:42:48.14 --> 01:42:58.78
But, you know, to me, and my experience said, the more you can look like an empty pair

1579
01:42:58.78 --> 01:43:03.90
of fatigues laying on the ground, the greater your chance of survival when somebody is

1580
01:43:03.90 --> 01:43:04.90
shooting at you.

1581
01:43:04.90 --> 01:43:10.18
So, the more stuff you put on your chest or around your waist that raises you up in the

1582
01:43:10.18 --> 01:43:11.82
air makes you more of a trombone.

1583
01:43:11.82 --> 01:43:14.02
I mean, I get my rucksack shot up all the time.

1584
01:43:14.02 --> 01:43:18.26
I'm happy laying there and bullets it was a thing and they're the rucksack because

1585
01:43:18.26 --> 01:43:20.90
it was sticking up, you know, about me.

1586
01:43:20.90 --> 01:43:26.02
But when you put that KY38 on your chest, that pushes your body up and other six things

1587
01:43:26.02 --> 01:43:27.50
is in the air.

1588
01:43:27.50 --> 01:43:32.54
So, now the chances of you getting hit, it's the other rucksack go up.

1589
01:43:32.54 --> 01:43:35.22
So, I didn't like to carry it.

1590
01:43:35.22 --> 01:43:37.54
I want to use it a few times.

1591
01:43:37.54 --> 01:43:41.34
I mean, it had a pretty high malfunction rate.

1592
01:43:41.34 --> 01:43:45.18
And then, because it's not just on you, you've got to make sure that the aircraft that

1593
01:43:45.18 --> 01:43:47.54
you're trying to talk to is running their encryption device.

1594
01:43:47.54 --> 01:43:53.86
Yeah, everybody has to have that same encryption, which is an interesting story.

1595
01:43:53.86 --> 01:43:55.82
We may get to a little later about that.

1596
01:43:55.82 --> 01:43:59.26
But, yeah, it was a pain.

1597
01:43:59.26 --> 01:44:02.34
But I wanted to talk on the radio.

1598
01:44:02.34 --> 01:44:07.74
And you guys didn't, I know, till they didn't carry like a belt-fed machine gun in their

1599
01:44:07.74 --> 01:44:08.74
elements.

1600
01:44:08.74 --> 01:44:12.74
And I think he said they never did, which to me was surprising.

1601
01:44:12.74 --> 01:44:18.42
Because like, you talked to Vietnam, sea-opthoons, and even like my sea-opthoons in Iraq,

1602
01:44:18.42 --> 01:44:22.26
we carried as many belt-fed machine guns as we could.

1603
01:44:22.26 --> 01:44:24.70
We wanted to have massive firepower.

1604
01:44:24.70 --> 01:44:31.18
But I guess for you guys, the jungle, the weight, it was too much.

1605
01:44:31.18 --> 01:44:37.18
My team carried one, a name 60 machine gun.

1606
01:44:37.18 --> 01:44:39.18
The same 60s are heavy.

1607
01:44:39.18 --> 01:44:41.18
They are heavy indeed.

1608
01:44:41.18 --> 01:44:47.02
My team carried one time, because I thought it would be cool.

1609
01:44:47.02 --> 01:44:54.06
I carried the machine gun, because I thought, man, the firepower I'll have with this thing.

1610
01:44:54.06 --> 01:45:01.06
I can show those guys on the other side here what war is all about.

1611
01:45:01.06 --> 01:45:04.82
And we made contact, and I opened up with that baby.

1612
01:45:04.82 --> 01:45:08.74
And I learned to lessen really quickly.

1613
01:45:08.74 --> 01:45:14.34
And it made sense when it happened, because we always teach.

1614
01:45:14.34 --> 01:45:16.70
You've got to take the machine gun out.

1615
01:45:16.70 --> 01:45:18.54
Ship's you fired a wherever that machine gun is.

1616
01:45:18.54 --> 01:45:19.54
Take that joke around.

1617
01:45:19.54 --> 01:45:21.22
And that's what they did.

1618
01:45:21.22 --> 01:45:23.18
And all of a sudden, everybody's shooting at me.

1619
01:45:23.18 --> 01:45:24.18
I said you were on this spot.

1620
01:45:24.18 --> 01:45:25.18
You were on this spot.

1621
01:45:25.18 --> 01:45:26.18
You were on this spot.

1622
01:45:26.18 --> 01:45:27.18
You were on this spot.

1623
01:45:27.18 --> 01:45:28.18
You were on this spot.

1624
01:45:28.18 --> 01:45:29.82
I mean, this stuff is just coming in all me.

1625
01:45:29.82 --> 01:45:31.38
And it's just eating everything up.

1626
01:45:31.38 --> 01:45:33.90
And I'm getting behind a tree and keeping my head around.

1627
01:45:33.90 --> 01:45:36.34
I'm shooting the machine gun around the side of the tree.

1628
01:45:36.34 --> 01:45:38.42
But I can't really see what I'm doing.

1629
01:45:38.42 --> 01:45:40.14
But I couldn't take my head around there.

1630
01:45:40.14 --> 01:45:41.74
They take it all.

1631
01:45:41.74 --> 01:45:44.30
So after that mission, that's enough of that.

1632
01:45:44.30 --> 01:45:46.02
I mean, I'm not carrying it.

1633
01:45:46.02 --> 01:45:52.90
Now, when we put teams together to make what we call a spike team, where we were going

1634
01:45:52.90 --> 01:46:03.10
in with the intent of engaging the enemy and not running, then we would carry two M60s at

1635
01:46:03.10 --> 01:46:04.10
least.

1636
01:46:04.10 --> 01:46:10.10
And then, when you carry an M60, everybody on a team has to carry M60 ammo.

1637
01:46:10.10 --> 01:46:14.14
I mean, everybody's got at least 100 ground belt with them.

1638
01:46:14.14 --> 01:46:16.86
You know, plus the machine gun is carrying all that extra weight.

1639
01:46:16.86 --> 01:46:20.50
So I mean, it doesn't just weight down the machine gun.

1640
01:46:20.50 --> 01:46:25.72
Everybody on a team now is still going to carry all those 40 millimeter, you know,

1641
01:46:25.72 --> 01:46:27.66
grenades with them for the M79.

1642
01:46:27.66 --> 01:46:29.30
You still got to carry that.

1643
01:46:29.30 --> 01:46:31.10
You still got to carry your extra clay mowers.

1644
01:46:31.10 --> 01:46:33.50
You got to carry all your mission equipment.

1645
01:46:33.50 --> 01:46:38.94
And now I'm giving another 15 20 pounds of machine gun ammo to carry along with you.

1646
01:46:38.94 --> 01:46:41.14
And there's only five or six of you.

1647
01:46:41.14 --> 01:46:45.18
Is the weight just goes up so fast that we didn't do it.

1648
01:46:45.18 --> 01:46:47.62
Yeah, and I guess another note I'm sitting here thinking about it.

1649
01:46:47.62 --> 01:46:53.26
The fact that you guys were in generally enclosed terrain, pretty tight.

1650
01:46:53.26 --> 01:46:58.54
It wasn't like you needed massive cover fire to cover ground to put, you know, you could

1651
01:46:58.54 --> 01:47:01.66
even have to fire maneuver because you take three steps and all of a sudden the enemy

1652
01:47:01.66 --> 01:47:02.66
can't see you anymore.

1653
01:47:02.66 --> 01:47:03.66
Yeah.

1654
01:47:03.66 --> 01:47:05.18
So that makes a little bit of sense too.

1655
01:47:05.18 --> 01:47:07.70
What was your opt-emple like, you know, we're talking about these missions.

1656
01:47:07.70 --> 01:47:10.38
How often were you guys going out?

1657
01:47:10.38 --> 01:47:16.86
Yeah, that's an interesting story and that it varied by team.

1658
01:47:16.86 --> 01:47:26.52
And like, well, and the 12 months that I was there, I went out 18 times, which was

1659
01:47:26.52 --> 01:47:32.04
wavering on, wavering on what an officer led team would do.

1660
01:47:32.04 --> 01:47:37.60
I don't know that the other team would go out that frequently, you know, in that

1661
01:47:37.60 --> 01:47:39.24
short appeared.

1662
01:47:39.24 --> 01:47:44.72
The paper that you signed when you joined SAB said, you know, a lot of volunteer to go

1663
01:47:44.72 --> 01:47:52.44
anywhere, do anything for six months or six missions, whichever comes first, got it.

1664
01:47:52.44 --> 01:47:56.44
At the end of the six missions or the six months, I've got to say, I've got to say,

1665
01:47:56.44 --> 01:47:58.12
I've volunteered to do it some more.

1666
01:47:58.12 --> 01:48:05.20
So you had this, you know, a little safety vibe in there to give you a chance to kind

1667
01:48:05.20 --> 01:48:10.04
of wake up and say, this is not a smart thing to do.

1668
01:48:10.04 --> 01:48:13.000
And here's my ticket to do something different.

1669
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Right.

1670
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Right.

1671
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.24
Well, that's sort of like the bombers in World War II that had to do 25 missions over

1672
01:48:20.24 --> 01:48:21.24
Europe.

1673
01:48:21.24 --> 01:48:25.08
And if they didn't 25, then they could go and do something else.

1674
01:48:25.08 --> 01:48:26.08
Go home.

1675
01:48:26.08 --> 01:48:28.08
Most of them didn't make it.

1676
01:48:28.08 --> 01:48:33.000
But yeah, that's pretty telling when they say that you only have to complete six

1677
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.72
missions that doesn't sound like a big deal.

1678
01:48:34.72 --> 01:48:38.36
You must be thinking yourself if they only want me to do six of these things, they

1679
01:48:38.36 --> 01:48:39.36
got to be pretty hairy.

1680
01:48:39.36 --> 01:48:42.88
If I only have to go out six times and six months, I mean, I've got to get

1681
01:48:42.88 --> 01:48:48.16
to deal, you know, the grunts are going out every day and fighting, you know, or doing

1682
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:49.96
something or being exposed.

1683
01:48:49.96 --> 01:49:03.44
So, you had that, and remember that sag missions, a sag mission really is an out-of-country

1684
01:49:03.44 --> 01:49:04.44
mission.

1685
01:49:04.44 --> 01:49:08.92
You know, as tilt says across the fence, you're going to another country.

1686
01:49:08.92 --> 01:49:18.52
When you see the casualties, you know, the KIAs of sag, at least in the beginning, they

1687
01:49:18.52 --> 01:49:24.12
all said, it's not where they were killed.

1688
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:25.52
So you were going out.

1689
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:32.60
But in between those missions, you might do something in-country.

1690
01:49:32.60 --> 01:49:38.88
Lynn Black, one of the tilt-spig buddies they were on the same team and stuff for a while,

1691
01:49:38.88 --> 01:49:44.28
Lynn was, you know, just an unbelievable one-zero.

1692
01:49:44.28 --> 01:49:49.52
And he and I, you know, kind of became friends in between missions, we would do things

1693
01:49:49.52 --> 01:49:52.20
like, why don't we take somewhere guys tonight?

1694
01:49:52.20 --> 01:49:54.80
And let's go with a marble mountain set up on ambush.

1695
01:49:54.80 --> 01:49:57.32
I guarantee you will get somebody to do that.

1696
01:49:57.32 --> 01:49:58.32
Let's go do that.

1697
01:49:58.32 --> 01:49:59.60
What about tomorrow afternoon?

1698
01:49:59.60 --> 01:50:04.000
You want to take some of our guys, let's go search some of the caves in Marble Mountain.

1699
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.80
Those dokers are in there, which is that's fine.

1700
01:50:06.80 --> 01:50:12.04
So we would do a lot of things like that, just for fun.

1701
01:50:12.04 --> 01:50:13.04
So that was a speed.

1702
01:50:13.04 --> 01:50:17.68
But you know, because, you know, compared to the regular mission, I mean, this isn't

1703
01:50:17.68 --> 01:50:18.68
a little brainer.

1704
01:50:18.68 --> 01:50:20.04
You just go with their new shoes, some people.

1705
01:50:20.04 --> 01:50:22.68
You know, you catch them in the cave and hold them there.

1706
01:50:22.68 --> 01:50:25.80
There are 40 miles deep in the Cambodia alone.

1707
01:50:25.80 --> 01:50:28.76
And when we, you know, we can be back in time for lunch.

1708
01:50:28.76 --> 01:50:31.04
I mean, let's go do this.

1709
01:50:31.04 --> 01:50:37.56
So, and then you had, you know, Marble Mountains or two combat outpost teams would rotate

1710
01:50:37.56 --> 01:50:38.56
up there.

1711
01:50:38.56 --> 01:50:41.76
You had to keep, you know, two teams up there all the time.

1712
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:46.40
So in between the missions, you know, you might go up there for a week or two weeks of the

1713
01:50:46.40 --> 01:50:53.68
time and then come back down a start mission, for another mission, and to go back out.

1714
01:50:53.68 --> 01:50:57.60
So it wasn't like you were just setting around in between the missions.

1715
01:50:57.60 --> 01:51:02.96
You were always doing something, plus you've done a lot of training and preparation for

1716
01:51:02.96 --> 01:51:04.88
the next mission that you had coming up.

1717
01:51:04.88 --> 01:51:07.12
So you stayed pretty busy.

1718
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:10.88
How long would it take you to brief a mission when you were going on?

1719
01:51:10.88 --> 01:51:18.44
Well, we might start with our initial briefing as a day briefing.

1720
01:51:18.44 --> 01:51:19.72
This is what we're going to go to do.

1721
01:51:19.72 --> 01:51:24.16
We're going to go do it and depending on what the mission was, I might say, okay.

1722
01:51:24.16 --> 01:51:30.08
So we're going to go over the place that was called Mucky Mountain.

1723
01:51:30.08 --> 01:51:35.72
We're going over to Mucky Mountain because it's a good place over there for us to rehearse

1724
01:51:35.72 --> 01:51:40.56
the actual mission, the raid, the ambush, whatever it was we're going to do.

1725
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:45.96
We can go over there and get in some realistic rehearsals.

1726
01:51:45.96 --> 01:51:49.32
So we might go spend a few days over there, just doing that.

1727
01:51:49.32 --> 01:51:55.64
While we're there, we rehearse our RLN procedures, putting on clay moars where they would

1728
01:51:55.64 --> 01:51:56.64
put them.

1729
01:51:56.64 --> 01:52:02.24
I would put the team in a different place every night so that you had to look at the

1730
01:52:02.24 --> 01:52:04.20
train we're in now.

1731
01:52:04.20 --> 01:52:07.48
What's the most likely approach is what do we need to defend the clay moars?

1732
01:52:07.48 --> 01:52:09.76
Where do we put the tow hoppers?

1733
01:52:09.76 --> 01:52:11.40
What's our avenue of egress?

1734
01:52:11.40 --> 01:52:12.64
How do we get out of here?

1735
01:52:12.64 --> 01:52:16.88
If they come out of some of those tracks and of those tracks and where do we go?

1736
01:52:16.88 --> 01:52:19.56
Where are the closest LZs that we're going to go to?

1737
01:52:19.56 --> 01:52:21.28
And how do we get there?

1738
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:23.16
Everybody needs to know that.

1739
01:52:23.16 --> 01:52:26.40
Whether you're American or indeed you've got to know where it is, you've got to know

1740
01:52:26.40 --> 01:52:27.68
how to get there.

1741
01:52:27.68 --> 01:52:33.000
So we would do the training like that, but particularly mission specific for what we're

1742
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.08
coming up on.

1743
01:52:35.08 --> 01:52:39.72
And then as you got closer, you get much more specific and then when you got

1744
01:52:39.72 --> 01:52:45.80
to the launch site, you would have the mission briefing where your air assets would be

1745
01:52:45.80 --> 01:52:46.80
there.

1746
01:52:46.80 --> 01:52:53.40
So the pilots who are going to fly your insertion, their gunship pilots, air force representative

1747
01:52:53.40 --> 01:52:58.56
for the A1E, that we're going to be there, the L4s that we're going to be there.

1748
01:52:58.56 --> 01:53:02.64
So you would have the big briefing there, everybody would agree on everything and make

1749
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:08.52
sure you had all the call signs and everything down and contingency actions.

1750
01:53:08.52 --> 01:53:13.48
And the Covey, I don't know anything about him, we'd always have a Covey out there with

1751
01:53:13.48 --> 01:53:19.52
a forward air controller that we could talk to and could look down and tell us what he was

1752
01:53:19.52 --> 01:53:20.52
seeing.

1753
01:53:20.52 --> 01:53:24.68
It might be of the see the bad guys coming to us or whatever.

1754
01:53:24.68 --> 01:53:27.76
You get more assets for us.

1755
01:53:27.76 --> 01:53:31.64
So it was a big deal.

1756
01:53:31.64 --> 01:53:41.88
And because you might have four gunships, two to four A1E's, generators, two to four

1757
01:53:41.88 --> 01:53:48.40
L4s, you've got Covey, you've got the insertion ships that you're going in with,

1758
01:53:48.40 --> 01:53:54.04
you've got trailing ships in case those get shot down that are flying empty so they can

1759
01:53:54.04 --> 01:53:56.76
drop down and pick you up.

1760
01:53:56.76 --> 01:54:03.28
Sometimes you might have a ship with a medics in it because you're expecting casualties.

1761
01:54:03.28 --> 01:54:09.56
So it could be a big air shell sometimes going in and if you were going, if you're going

1762
01:54:09.56 --> 01:54:13.16
to North Vietnam, you had to have the F4s.

1763
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:17.44
I mean, it was just required for the mission.

1764
01:54:17.44 --> 01:54:23.12
Some of the others, and Lousy Cambodia, you could go without the F4s to use the A1E

1765
01:54:23.12 --> 01:54:28.88
generators, but if you go in North Vietnam, you've got to have the F4s with you because

1766
01:54:28.88 --> 01:54:31.64
they could send a mig down there and ask you if they wanted to.

1767
01:54:31.64 --> 01:54:37.84
So you had to worry about air cover as well as hitting big targets.

1768
01:54:37.84 --> 01:54:42.44
And the F4s, you know, you can get your attention real fast.

1769
01:54:42.44 --> 01:54:49.40
And they're the skyriders, you know, do too because they fly low, slow, and they're

1770
01:54:49.40 --> 01:54:54.16
carrying their own weight in the ordinance and they can put it right next to you.

1771
01:54:54.16 --> 01:54:58.76
Do you tell them where you want that 20 millimeters hitting 10 feet over there and ride

1772
01:54:58.76 --> 01:55:02.72
along with Ajay or whatever the ordinance they're carrying?

1773
01:55:02.72 --> 01:55:04.76
Maybe you get to your attention.

1774
01:55:04.76 --> 01:55:07.56
I mean those, those jokers are good.

1775
01:55:07.56 --> 01:55:09.04
All right.

1776
01:55:09.04 --> 01:55:13.48
So how many missions did you do with RT Alabama?

1777
01:55:13.48 --> 01:55:20.28
A4.

1778
01:55:20.28 --> 01:55:21.76
And then after that, did you get the up check from deck to become a 1-0?

1779
01:55:21.76 --> 01:55:22.76
Yeah.

1780
01:55:22.76 --> 01:55:24.24
So I had gotten that.

1781
01:55:24.24 --> 01:55:30.76
I mean, I already, I had it before we did the 4, but we knew that FOB1 was going to close

1782
01:55:30.76 --> 01:55:36.24
down and when it closed down, the teams were going to get scattered around.

1783
01:55:36.24 --> 01:55:42.52
So I knew I would get a team, but I would get one somewhere else.

1784
01:55:42.52 --> 01:55:50.000
So we just stayed together, you know, for those 4 missions and then when we moved, when

1785
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:59.08
I moved to Dane to CCN, then I took over RT Michigan.

1786
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:08.12
And RT Michigan was the one that had, I don't remember who the 1-0 had been on that one,

1787
01:56:08.12 --> 01:56:15.16
that Elden Bargewell was the 1-1 on that one.

1788
01:56:15.16 --> 01:56:22.92
So I took over that and, you know, the guy was, he was being listed.

1789
01:56:22.92 --> 01:56:23.92
He got the type.

1790
01:56:23.92 --> 01:56:25.20
He just back 4, I think.

1791
01:56:25.20 --> 01:56:26.20
Yeah.

1792
01:56:26.20 --> 01:56:28.20
I mean, he was already alleged.

1793
01:56:28.20 --> 01:56:30.88
Well, he, he already had a good reputation.

1794
01:56:30.88 --> 01:56:31.88
Good reputation.

1795
01:56:31.88 --> 01:56:32.88
Yeah.

1796
01:56:32.88 --> 01:56:39.88
So we, you know, he got along well because I had to ask about him because I didn't, you

1797
01:56:39.88 --> 01:56:42.28
know, he was a different company, nobody.

1798
01:56:42.28 --> 01:56:46.66
So I had to ask about him and everybody I talked to said, man, you know, this guy was

1799
01:56:46.66 --> 01:56:47.66
good.

1800
01:56:47.66 --> 01:56:51.96
He had, he was asking everyone else about you too.

1801
01:56:51.96 --> 01:56:54.76
He was asking about me and he, he don't.

1802
01:56:54.76 --> 01:56:57.20
And I said, well, why did they tell you?

1803
01:56:57.20 --> 01:57:04.76
And he said, well, I talked to, you know, Sergeant Jones and, you know, it was impressive

1804
01:57:04.76 --> 01:57:08.60
because he said, and, you know, I had total faith in him.

1805
01:57:08.60 --> 01:57:15.84
He said, Thompson is the only lieutenant I've ever met that you could give a mapping

1806
01:57:15.84 --> 01:57:21.88
compass to and he could tell you where he was and he could navigate you to any place

1807
01:57:21.88 --> 01:57:22.88
you wanted to go.

1808
01:57:22.88 --> 01:57:26.68
And he said, you just don't find a lieutenant like that.

1809
01:57:26.68 --> 01:57:29.08
So he, you know, bargeals that was good enough for him.

1810
01:57:29.08 --> 01:57:35.22
And if I knew where we were, yeah, so isn't it surprising that that would be a skill

1811
01:57:35.22 --> 01:57:40.64
that's so needed and that people didn't actually have it sometimes.

1812
01:57:40.64 --> 01:57:42.40
It's crazy.

1813
01:57:42.40 --> 01:57:47.74
And these days, well, you know, kids are relying on the GPS and they forget about some

1814
01:57:47.74 --> 01:57:52.64
of those land nav skills and it always cracked me up because they're now they're to a

1815
01:57:52.64 --> 01:57:57.72
point where they really rely on the GPS, they don't know their pace count and, you

1816
01:57:57.72 --> 01:58:02.48
know, I'd be walking on the training operation, you know, it's okay, you know, just not even

1817
01:58:02.48 --> 01:58:06.32
thinking about looking at a GPS because I did a map study and know where we're at.

1818
01:58:06.32 --> 01:58:09.52
And those younger guys, you know, they just, they just don't have this, not all of them

1819
01:58:09.52 --> 01:58:13.84
of course, you know, we still get some guys that are great at it, but it's just a different

1820
01:58:13.84 --> 01:58:14.84
time.

1821
01:58:14.84 --> 01:58:20.72
So you take over this, you take over this new team, you got barge well, which I'm sure

1822
01:58:20.72 --> 01:58:27.12
you heard me talking about it with Tilt, but you know, he was when I was a young officer,

1823
01:58:27.12 --> 01:58:31.64
I just got picked up for a commission and I went to Germany and he was the guy in charge

1824
01:58:31.64 --> 01:58:32.64
over there.

1825
01:58:32.64 --> 01:58:39.72
And so, and my boss who was an outstanding guy who was a great mentor to me, but he, he

1826
01:58:39.72 --> 01:58:42.64
would kind of tell me, you know, about the old man.

1827
01:58:42.64 --> 01:58:45.84
He'd say, barge well, said this and barge well, said that, you know, so that was pretty

1828
01:58:45.84 --> 01:58:47.92
neat for me to make this connection.

1829
01:58:47.92 --> 01:58:52.92
And here you are, said to here that actually he was your, he was your one one.

1830
01:58:52.92 --> 01:58:53.92
Yeah.

1831
01:58:53.92 --> 01:58:59.04
And he, I mean, he was very knowledgeable, very good.

1832
01:58:59.04 --> 01:59:01.48
And I, you know, I was impressed with him right from the beginning.

1833
01:59:01.48 --> 01:59:05.32
I thought, I mean, this guy's good.

1834
01:59:05.32 --> 01:59:13.24
And, you know, when we went out on an operation, he's this cool and calm.

1835
01:59:13.24 --> 01:59:16.92
You know, when his shooting started, I mean, he was good.

1836
01:59:16.92 --> 01:59:19.96
But, I mean, he had, he had experience.

1837
01:59:19.96 --> 01:59:23.76
I mean, he was a case-eye with a team there, the Siege of case-eye.

1838
01:59:23.76 --> 01:59:25.64
I mean, he was, he was there.

1839
01:59:25.64 --> 01:59:31.16
I mean, where they just got hammered for, you know, several weeks there.

1840
01:59:31.16 --> 01:59:35.04
He was, you know, there were that special forces of detachment.

1841
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:39.72
He had recruited, actually, had recruited some of the team members that we had.

1842
01:59:39.72 --> 01:59:40.92
And this was the yard team.

1843
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:44.28
You know, they all liked him.

1844
01:59:44.28 --> 01:59:48.12
They all had a lot of respect for him.

1845
01:59:48.12 --> 01:59:51.72
And he, you know, he was a support guy.

1846
01:59:51.72 --> 01:59:57.52
I just never thought then, you know, where he would end up.

1847
01:59:57.52 --> 02:00:04.52
I figured, you know, if he doesn't get killed, he's probably going to be somebody at some

1848
02:00:04.52 --> 02:00:05.52
point.

1849
02:00:05.52 --> 02:00:10.72
But I didn't expect to see him.

1850
02:00:10.72 --> 02:00:14.52
I don't know, I guess it was in the late 70s.

1851
02:00:14.52 --> 02:00:16.16
I saw him at Fort Bragg.

1852
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:19.32
No, I guess it was in the 80s.

1853
02:00:19.32 --> 02:00:22.52
I saw him at Fort Bragg.

1854
02:00:22.52 --> 02:00:25.92
And he was a captain.

1855
02:00:25.92 --> 02:00:30.40
And I'm thinking, you know, I can be a captain.

1856
02:00:30.40 --> 02:00:32.60
I'm a major.

1857
02:00:32.60 --> 02:00:33.60
You were a spectator.

1858
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:37.64
Last time I saw you, the now you were a captain.

1859
02:00:37.64 --> 02:00:40.20
And I, you know, I thought that was great.

1860
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:41.20
So we hung out a little bit.

1861
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:43.32
He was in Delta.

1862
02:00:43.32 --> 02:00:49.48
So we chatted about, you know, Delta Forest and all that kind of stuff.

1863
02:00:49.48 --> 02:00:53.76
And, you know, I had some good times all day, they were together at Bragg.

1864
02:00:53.76 --> 02:01:01.40
And then I guess, you know, the next time I actually saw him, he was a major.

1865
02:01:01.40 --> 02:01:06.08
And he used that to come in and go into the Commander Journal of Staff College.

1866
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:10.92
And I'm thinking, I'm about to get promoted, but I'm still a major too.

1867
02:01:10.92 --> 02:01:13.68
I just, I just got to do in this.

1868
02:01:13.68 --> 02:01:16.32
And, you know, the next thing, he's a lieutenant colonel.

1869
02:01:16.32 --> 02:01:21.20
And then he's a full colonel and, you know, ends up a major general.

1870
02:01:21.20 --> 02:01:23.48
And he just constantly going.

1871
02:01:23.48 --> 02:01:27.72
And everybody kept telling me, get out of special forces.

1872
02:01:27.72 --> 02:01:30.16
Special forces is a kiss of death or an officer.

1873
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:32.60
You stay in special forces.

1874
02:01:32.60 --> 02:01:34.16
You're not going anywhere.

1875
02:01:34.16 --> 02:01:45.80
He did. I mean, not only the, the great on that tour with Sog, he did a second tour.

1876
02:01:45.80 --> 02:01:49.72
He ended up, no command, not just being in Delta.

1877
02:01:49.72 --> 02:01:52.68
He came back and commanded Delta Forest.

1878
02:01:52.68 --> 02:01:55.92
And then overall, special operations and all this kind of stuff.

1879
02:01:55.92 --> 02:01:58.44
I mean, just unbelievable.

1880
02:01:58.44 --> 02:01:59.72
Do you notice any qualities?

1881
02:01:59.72 --> 02:02:03.96
I mean, you said you looked at him and you were like, oh, yeah, this guy will do well.

1882
02:02:03.96 --> 02:02:07.04
If he lives, was there any qualities that stand out?

1883
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:13.36
You know, if you're, if you're a young, enlisted guy in the army right now or in any branch

1884
02:02:13.36 --> 02:02:16.48
and you said yourself, you know, I want to be a good soldier.

1885
02:02:16.48 --> 02:02:20.60
Is there anything that you noticed about him that you would give us like guidance to young,

1886
02:02:20.60 --> 02:02:21.60
young trooper out there?

1887
02:02:21.60 --> 02:02:24.20
He was mission focus.

1888
02:02:24.20 --> 02:02:28.08
You tell him, this is what you need to do or, or you need to go.

1889
02:02:28.08 --> 02:02:30.72
I mean, he's gonna make it happen.

1890
02:02:30.72 --> 02:02:33.52
Cool, calm.

1891
02:02:33.52 --> 02:02:34.52
He was a smart guy.

1892
02:02:34.52 --> 02:02:37.24
I mean, he didn't brag about it.

1893
02:02:37.24 --> 02:02:43.04
When you talk to him, it's just very humble.

1894
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:46.48
And, but you could tell, I mean, he smart.

1895
02:02:46.48 --> 02:02:50.20
I mean, he's thinking about what you're saying and what he comes out with and when he

1896
02:02:50.20 --> 02:02:55.04
makes recommendations and talks about things, you need to be listening because he's

1897
02:02:55.04 --> 02:02:59.64
thought to step through.

1898
02:02:59.64 --> 02:03:01.84
No fear from a combat perspective.

1899
02:03:01.84 --> 02:03:07.64
I mean, if the bad guys are coming, he's gonna take them out and you know, demonstrate

1900
02:03:07.64 --> 02:03:13.36
it out, you know, on several occasions with me, demonstrated it later on.

1901
02:03:13.36 --> 02:03:21.88
I think you got, I think you got hit the next mission after he was with me.

1902
02:03:21.88 --> 02:03:25.16
But he had put on a K47 vest.

1903
02:03:25.16 --> 02:03:27.96
You know, so got shot and shot and the charge.

1904
02:03:27.96 --> 02:03:28.96
The charge is the inner self.

1905
02:03:28.96 --> 02:03:29.96
Yeah.

1906
02:03:29.96 --> 02:03:34.36
You know, he poked through enough to make a little hole in him, but it didn't go all the

1907
02:03:34.36 --> 02:03:37.60
way through, you know.

1908
02:03:37.60 --> 02:03:44.04
But, and any, you know, on another mission, he got shot a couple more times and another

1909
02:03:44.04 --> 02:03:45.04
mission.

1910
02:03:45.04 --> 02:03:47.84
He'd be 40 rocket hit the team.

1911
02:03:47.84 --> 02:03:49.08
Everybody was wanted to hit.

1912
02:03:49.08 --> 02:03:55.72
He had a piece of a trap, he'll go in through his cheek and kind of lied by his eye.

1913
02:03:55.72 --> 02:04:00.96
You know, so he's bleeding like a stuck pig and, you know, the bad guys are coming and,

1914
02:04:00.96 --> 02:04:02.72
you know, he takes out 20 of them.

1915
02:04:02.72 --> 02:04:10.52
But he's got an RPD, you know, the Soviet kind of a light machine gun.

1916
02:04:10.52 --> 02:04:14.96
And he just taken people out right and left, you know, with the whole, everybody wanted

1917
02:04:14.96 --> 02:04:15.96
to include in him.

1918
02:04:15.96 --> 02:04:19.08
But that's what he did.

1919
02:04:19.08 --> 02:04:25.52
The only general on record that for a personal firearm, carried an eight-year-old

1920
02:04:25.52 --> 02:04:29.52
AK-47, an AK-47.

1921
02:04:29.52 --> 02:04:33.56
He's blocking the hands of general officers and he's still having that little pop gun on his

1922
02:04:33.56 --> 02:04:34.56
hip.

1923
02:04:34.56 --> 02:04:40.12
He's got an AK-47 slung over his shoulder and he's telling, you know, his aids and body

1924
02:04:40.12 --> 02:04:44.60
guards, hey, if we get in trouble, you know, worry about me.

1925
02:04:44.60 --> 02:04:45.96
Say, do you guys take care of yourself?

1926
02:04:45.96 --> 02:04:47.96
I'll take care of me.

1927
02:04:47.96 --> 02:04:50.96
And, you know, just down real.

1928
02:04:50.96 --> 02:04:55.96
That's that.

1929
02:04:55.96 --> 02:05:00.96
We spent a lot of time up on a marble mountain together.

1930
02:05:00.96 --> 02:05:05.96
With the rotation and stuff, so we spent time there.

1931
02:05:05.96 --> 02:05:08.96
So we'd have those little fights, most nights.

1932
02:05:08.96 --> 02:05:10.96
The bad guys trying to come up and get us.

1933
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:13.96
That's night-pursed, shoot at us just before dark.

1934
02:05:13.96 --> 02:05:19.96
There was one cave opening that was almost on our level.

1935
02:05:19.96 --> 02:05:23.96
I don't know, 50 meters away from us.

1936
02:05:23.96 --> 02:05:30.96
That if they worked their way up to that opening, they could shoot just about into us at night.

1937
02:05:30.96 --> 02:05:38.96
I've got videos of that cave and you can see how the marble is just chipped off all round

1938
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:46.96
the opening of that cave where we're shooting out of a night when they're up in there and stuff.

1939
02:05:46.96 --> 02:05:50.96
It was a good relationship.

1940
02:05:50.96 --> 02:05:55.96
So one of the things you got in here in your notes is you guys did a mission.

1941
02:05:55.96 --> 02:05:57.96
RT-Mesh again.

1942
02:05:57.96 --> 02:06:03.96
And you guys inserted into the Layotion border with 101st Airborne.

1943
02:06:03.96 --> 02:06:07.96
It sounded like a pretty good trick, you know, kind of a...

1944
02:06:07.96 --> 02:06:09.96
It was kind of a...

1945
02:06:09.96 --> 02:06:13.96
When they told us what they wanted us to do, I thought,

1946
02:06:13.96 --> 02:06:16.96
this sounds like a Ranger School.

1947
02:06:16.96 --> 02:06:19.96
This is exactly a scenario in Ranger School.

1948
02:06:19.96 --> 02:06:22.96
What did they tell you they wanted you to do?

1949
02:06:22.96 --> 02:06:29.96
This was going to be a walk-in mission, so we would start on the Vietnam side of the border

1950
02:06:29.96 --> 02:06:35.96
and we would walk over and to the area they wanted us to go to.

1951
02:06:35.96 --> 02:06:41.96
And they wanted us to do that from position where the 101st was currently located.

1952
02:06:41.96 --> 02:06:47.96
So there was a battalion from the 101st that was set up right on the border.

1953
02:06:47.96 --> 02:06:54.96
And so they coordinated to have us have our team put on still pots.

1954
02:06:54.96 --> 02:06:56.96
All that kind of stuff came on those...

1955
02:06:56.96 --> 02:06:57.96
The resupply helicopters.

1956
02:06:57.96 --> 02:07:05.96
We came in with a resupply like we were, you know, new troops coming to be there when we jumped off.

1957
02:07:05.96 --> 02:07:11.96
And then they put us in the perimeter of it, but in a section.

1958
02:07:11.96 --> 02:07:15.96
And said, do you need to dig in?

1959
02:07:15.96 --> 02:07:19.96
You know, and all the little guys were looking around saying,

1960
02:07:19.96 --> 02:07:20.96
what?

1961
02:07:20.96 --> 02:07:24.96
You need to dig a hole, flocks over to get in, finding a musician.

1962
02:07:24.96 --> 02:07:26.96
And the response, we don't dig.

1963
02:07:26.96 --> 02:07:28.96
So you need to dig.

1964
02:07:28.96 --> 02:07:32.96
I mean, we're out here with people, you know, you know, bullets going everywhere.

1965
02:07:32.96 --> 02:07:36.96
We need to dig in, so the good thing we did goes, got a little hairy.

1966
02:07:36.96 --> 02:07:41.96
You know, it was nice to be able to get down in a hole.

1967
02:07:41.96 --> 02:07:46.96
And then I met with the company commander and the team leaders.

1968
02:07:46.96 --> 02:07:49.96
And they're forward to observer.

1969
02:07:49.96 --> 02:07:52.96
And I gave them our plan.

1970
02:07:52.96 --> 02:07:55.96
You know, here's what we're going to do.

1971
02:07:55.96 --> 02:07:59.96
But what shocked them was, I said, okay.

1972
02:07:59.96 --> 02:08:06.96
These coordinates, I want you to pre plan that as an artillery target.

1973
02:08:06.96 --> 02:08:08.96
And here's the name of it.

1974
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:12.96
And I want one here and here and here and these are the names.

1975
02:08:12.96 --> 02:08:15.96
All I'm going to do is call that name out.

1976
02:08:15.96 --> 02:08:19.96
You know, target Roger.

1977
02:08:19.96 --> 02:08:21.96
I'm not going to give you coordinates.

1978
02:08:21.96 --> 02:08:23.96
You got to have that already planned.

1979
02:08:23.96 --> 02:08:26.96
Now I say Roger, I expect the artillery.

1980
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:28.96
I never had artillery before.

1981
02:08:28.96 --> 02:08:29.96
So this was great.

1982
02:08:29.96 --> 02:08:31.96
We've never in range of artillery.

1983
02:08:31.96 --> 02:08:32.96
And all of a sudden I guided I planned.

1984
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:34.96
I planned it stuff all over the place.

1985
02:08:34.96 --> 02:08:43.96
And so the, we did the next morning was that first light we went down to the stream with the water resupply team.

1986
02:08:43.96 --> 02:08:47.96
They'd go down and fill all the canteens and things up and bring them up.

1987
02:08:47.96 --> 02:08:50.96
So we went down with them dressed like the hundred first.

1988
02:08:50.96 --> 02:08:57.96
And when we got down there, you know, we changed into our Batman suits and gave them the helmets and flat jackets and all that stuff.

1989
02:08:57.96 --> 02:09:00.96
And they threw them in bags and carried them back up.

1990
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:06.96
And we just, you know, went on across the river and to the jungle there on our mission.

1991
02:09:06.96 --> 02:09:12.96
So hoping that the bad guys thought, you know, nobody had come in that way.

1992
02:09:12.96 --> 02:09:14.96
So I went out on our mission.

1993
02:09:14.96 --> 02:09:23.96
There was, there was a hatchet force, baton that had been inserted, you know, much farther out in the valley.

1994
02:09:23.96 --> 02:09:31.96
But we, we went in and, I mean, it was, it was just, you know, different and a cool way to do something.

1995
02:09:31.96 --> 02:09:39.96
And then, you know, when we got in contact, you know, when I call for those targets, they put it right on them.

1996
02:09:39.96 --> 02:09:42.96
So that was a cool thing.

1997
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:50.96
It was interesting that we had barge well and the one too that was on the other side.

1998
02:09:50.96 --> 02:09:55.96
And the one too that was on the team with us.

1999
02:09:55.96 --> 02:10:01.96
We had a little disagreement about our exact location.

2000
02:10:01.96 --> 02:10:06.96
And I'm telling those two, no, I'm telling you, we are right here.

2001
02:10:06.96 --> 02:10:09.96
Nice and no, you're 200 meters off.

2002
02:10:09.96 --> 02:10:11.96
This is no way.

2003
02:10:11.96 --> 02:10:13.96
So, you know, we, we didn't contact.

2004
02:10:13.96 --> 02:10:18.96
Then I had told them, I said, you know, if we were, I am, or where I'm saying we are.

2005
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:26.96
So there's a fork in the stream and there's a little footbridge going across one right out there, about 150 meters in front of us.

2006
02:10:26.96 --> 02:10:29.96
There's a road and there's a stream out here.

2007
02:10:29.96 --> 02:10:32.96
I said, you know, I'll take you down here.

2008
02:10:32.96 --> 02:10:34.96
I thought we were doing a make contact.

2009
02:10:34.96 --> 02:10:36.96
And we had to come out on strings.

2010
02:10:36.96 --> 02:10:40.96
So when they were living for their first time coming out on strings?

2011
02:10:40.96 --> 02:10:42.96
No, they'd been out before.

2012
02:10:42.96 --> 02:10:43.96
Okay.

2013
02:10:43.96 --> 02:10:47.96
So they were picking us up and they couldn't see me because they were in front of me.

2014
02:10:47.96 --> 02:10:49.96
But I'm there.

2015
02:10:49.96 --> 02:10:51.96
It's right there.

2016
02:10:51.96 --> 02:10:53.96
You're getting ready to get shot.

2017
02:10:53.96 --> 02:10:55.96
But you're like, hey, I was right.

2018
02:10:55.96 --> 02:10:57.96
That's right.

2019
02:10:57.96 --> 02:10:58.96
Yeah.

2020
02:10:58.96 --> 02:11:02.96
There's a, you know, 10 days at grid coordinates and they were right on.

2021
02:11:02.96 --> 02:11:05.96
So when you were, were you just using pace count?

2022
02:11:05.96 --> 02:11:06.96
Yeah.

2023
02:11:06.96 --> 02:11:08.96
Use the pace count to strain.

2024
02:11:08.96 --> 02:11:09.96
Yeah.

2025
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:12.96
You know, I spent a lot of time in the woods growing on them.

2026
02:11:12.96 --> 02:11:16.96
So I, and, and particularly in the dark on the other dark.

2027
02:11:16.96 --> 02:11:19.96
I can, I can feel the change in the train.

2028
02:11:19.96 --> 02:11:24.96
I know if I'm going up here, down here, if I'm on a little side, whatever.

2029
02:11:24.96 --> 02:11:30.96
So I would take the section of the map that I thought we were going to operate in.

2030
02:11:30.96 --> 02:11:32.96
I just memorized it.

2031
02:11:32.96 --> 02:11:35.96
Did you guys have one to 50,000 maps?

2032
02:11:35.96 --> 02:11:37.96
Or they went to 24.

2033
02:11:37.96 --> 02:11:38.96
Yeah.

2034
02:11:38.96 --> 02:11:39.96
Well, we had both.

2035
02:11:39.96 --> 02:11:42.96
But what we, depending on the distance that we were going to go.

2036
02:11:42.96 --> 02:11:46.96
But I could just, I mean, usually we didn't go very far.

2037
02:11:46.96 --> 02:11:47.96
Yeah.

2038
02:11:47.96 --> 02:11:50.96
So you can memorize if you're used to doing that.

2039
02:11:50.96 --> 02:11:51.96
The section of the map.

2040
02:11:51.96 --> 02:11:54.96
I could see it in my mind, you know, when we're moving.

2041
02:11:54.96 --> 02:11:57.96
You know, where we were, and you what the pace counts were on you.

2042
02:11:57.96 --> 02:12:00.96
What the terrain should look like.

2043
02:12:00.96 --> 02:12:01.96
You know, where we were.

2044
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:07.96
I had a checkpoint set up that, that, you know, if we're here, we'll see this.

2045
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:08.96
If we're here, we'll see this.

2046
02:12:08.96 --> 02:12:13.96
Yeah. So I could track it plus I used to pace count.

2047
02:12:13.96 --> 02:12:16.96
So I knew where I was out there.

2048
02:12:16.96 --> 02:12:22.96
That was one thing that I, I thought was critical because eventually you're going to have to call

2049
02:12:22.96 --> 02:12:25.96
for help and you need to be able to tell them where you are.

2050
02:12:25.96 --> 02:12:30.96
And under triple canopy jungle, you're not shooting asmists to hill tops and things like that.

2051
02:12:30.96 --> 02:12:34.96
I mean, you got to know where you are on the ground because you know the topology.

2052
02:12:34.96 --> 02:12:39.96
I don't know what it feels like, what it looks like and how far you've gone.

2053
02:12:39.96 --> 02:12:42.96
Yeah, that was just the skill set that I had.

2054
02:12:42.96 --> 02:12:46.96
No, no more important piece of information on the battlefield than where you are.

2055
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:48.96
You don't know where you are.

2056
02:12:48.96 --> 02:12:51.96
It doesn't matter where the enemy is because you can't call for fire.

2057
02:12:51.96 --> 02:12:54.96
You can't maneuver on them because you don't know where you are.

2058
02:12:54.96 --> 02:12:58.96
When you guys were, um, will you guys just get an overwhelmed?

2059
02:12:58.96 --> 02:13:00.96
Is that why you guys had to come out on strings on that one?

2060
02:13:00.96 --> 02:13:01.96
Yeah.

2061
02:13:01.96 --> 02:13:06.96
How big was the enemy force to think that you rolled into and your notes you're using lots.

2062
02:13:06.96 --> 02:13:09.96
It says lots of ed VA.

2063
02:13:09.96 --> 02:13:16.96
I typically use the term lot spinning, you know, a hundred or more.

2064
02:13:16.96 --> 02:13:19.96
So how did you guys stumble across them?

2065
02:13:19.96 --> 02:13:21.96
I'm sorry.

2066
02:13:21.96 --> 02:13:22.96
Where did the contact come from?

2067
02:13:22.96 --> 02:13:25.96
Like what did that contact start like?

2068
02:13:25.96 --> 02:13:29.96
It really started because

2069
02:13:29.96 --> 02:13:36.96
Headquarters decided they needed to resupply us because they wanted us to stay longer.

2070
02:13:36.96 --> 02:13:45.96
And I was saying, no, don't bring a helicopter out here and hover over our position.

2071
02:13:45.96 --> 02:13:47.96
Don't do that.

2072
02:13:47.96 --> 02:13:50.96
Yeah, you got to get resupplyed.

2073
02:13:50.96 --> 02:13:52.96
And they did it anyway.

2074
02:13:52.96 --> 02:13:56.96
So, you know, once you have a chopper hovering above the canopy there,

2075
02:13:56.96 --> 02:14:01.96
drop and stuff down through it, the bad guys, I mean, they're all over the place anyway.

2076
02:14:01.96 --> 02:14:04.96
They must be somebody down there.

2077
02:14:04.96 --> 02:14:05.96
We have nothing else.

2078
02:14:05.96 --> 02:14:07.96
They're going to go get whatever fellow helicopter.

2079
02:14:07.96 --> 02:14:08.96
And they did.

2080
02:14:08.96 --> 02:14:13.96
They came down there and they were, sort of, kind of, you know,

2081
02:14:13.96 --> 02:14:16.96
messed up the afternoon in terms of what we'd planned to do.

2082
02:14:16.96 --> 02:14:19.96
You know, but we got out.

2083
02:14:19.96 --> 02:14:26.96
And it's an extraction on strings through, you know, double canopy,

2084
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:29.96
the jungle is rough.

2085
02:14:29.96 --> 02:14:33.96
Because you, you've been dragged through the limbs of the trees, the

2086
02:14:33.96 --> 02:14:39.96
pre-tops, the aircraft will always start to go forward.

2087
02:14:39.96 --> 02:14:41.96
And then you're being drug through them.

2088
02:14:41.96 --> 02:14:44.96
And what they want to get to help them get a fire, right?

2089
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:45.96
Yeah, because they're getting shot at.

2090
02:14:45.96 --> 02:14:47.96
They don't want to stay there long.

2091
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:51.96
You're getting shot out and it's hard for you to see it because you're

2092
02:14:51.96 --> 02:14:53.96
twisting and turning and hitting leaves.

2093
02:14:53.96 --> 02:14:55.96
And, you know, now they're behind you.

2094
02:14:55.96 --> 02:14:58.96
And it's hard to shoot that way.

2095
02:14:58.96 --> 02:15:01.96
And, you know, they're only going to take,

2096
02:15:01.96 --> 02:15:04.96
maybe four people at a time out anyway.

2097
02:15:04.96 --> 02:15:07.96
So that means you got another chopper coming in.

2098
02:15:07.96 --> 02:15:11.96
The bad guys know you're going out on strings now.

2099
02:15:11.96 --> 02:15:15.96
And you've got another aircraft coming in to pick up the rest of the team.

2100
02:15:15.96 --> 02:15:19.96
I'm the team leader. I'm always.

2101
02:15:19.96 --> 02:15:23.96
First off, first one on the ground, the last one on the ground.

2102
02:15:23.96 --> 02:15:26.96
You know, so I'm coming out with that last aircraft.

2103
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:30.96
I'm the last one, you know, to come up off the ground.

2104
02:15:30.96 --> 02:15:34.96
And, you know, they've got your pretty well zeroed in by then.

2105
02:15:34.96 --> 02:15:37.96
You know, you know, you're starting to work some gunships and stuff.

2106
02:15:37.96 --> 02:15:41.96
But, you know, the pilots don't like staying there.

2107
02:15:41.96 --> 02:15:46.96
And then, then they get over the, in this case,

2108
02:15:46.96 --> 02:15:49.96
you get over there in an aircraft fire.

2109
02:15:49.96 --> 02:15:52.96
I mean, all of a sudden we're 7,000 feet freezing.

2110
02:15:52.96 --> 02:15:53.96
AGL.

2111
02:15:53.96 --> 02:15:54.96
Yeah.

2112
02:15:54.96 --> 02:15:55.96
Not to the level.

2113
02:15:55.96 --> 02:15:58.96
AGL hanging on the end of a rope covered in sweat.

2114
02:15:58.96 --> 02:16:00.96
And, and freezing to death.

2115
02:16:00.96 --> 02:16:04.96
And I've looking up, you know, and I'm swinging back and forth.

2116
02:16:04.96 --> 02:16:08.96
So my rope is rubbing back and forth on the edge of the floor.

2117
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:15.96
And I'm thinking, we got a long way to go and it's starting to fray the rope up here.

2118
02:16:15.96 --> 02:16:20.96
And, you know, are we going to get to a place they can set us down before that thing breaks.

2119
02:16:20.96 --> 02:16:26.96
So that runs your rounds a level up a little bit and, you know, place your shiver.

2120
02:16:26.96 --> 02:16:29.96
And then, you know, I asked about 30 minutes.

2121
02:16:29.96 --> 02:16:30.96
Your legs are asleep.

2122
02:16:30.96 --> 02:16:33.96
You can't walk because it's cut this circulation off.

2123
02:16:33.96 --> 02:16:36.96
So even when you get to wherever they're going to set you down,

2124
02:16:36.96 --> 02:16:38.96
you can't stand up.

2125
02:16:38.96 --> 02:16:41.96
They have to come out and get you and pick you up and put you in a helicopter.

2126
02:16:41.96 --> 02:16:43.96
So it's another day at saw, you know?

2127
02:16:43.96 --> 02:16:45.96
Another day at saw.

2128
02:16:47.96 --> 02:16:49.96
You did a snatch mission.

2129
02:16:49.96 --> 02:16:51.96
You mentioned in these notes.

2130
02:16:51.96 --> 02:16:57.96
You did a little, a little, you set up and set up the ambush.

2131
02:16:57.96 --> 02:17:00.96
Try to capture someone.

2132
02:17:00.96 --> 02:17:02.96
It doesn't seem like you mentioned a couple times.

2133
02:17:02.96 --> 02:17:05.96
You weren't very successful at capturing people.

2134
02:17:05.96 --> 02:17:08.96
Yeah, yeah.

2135
02:17:08.96 --> 02:17:09.96
To get up.

2136
02:17:09.96 --> 02:17:11.96
Is this how you got your second nickname?

2137
02:17:11.96 --> 02:17:12.96
Terminator.

2138
02:17:12.96 --> 02:17:20.96
You know, if they don't cooperate, you know, sometimes they get terminated.

2139
02:17:20.96 --> 02:17:28.96
So, you know, when this one, I mean, we had rehearsed, we had practices.

2140
02:17:28.96 --> 02:17:33.96
And one of the techniques of the prisoners snatch is if you have a trail that's.

2141
02:17:33.96 --> 02:17:36.96
People are going to move up and down in small groups.

2142
02:17:36.96 --> 02:17:43.96
You practice setting up an ambush that has a dead spot in it.

2143
02:17:43.96 --> 02:17:47.96
So in the middle of the ambush, usually.

2144
02:17:47.96 --> 02:17:50.96
No one's going to fire into that zone.

2145
02:17:50.96 --> 02:17:52.96
The clay moors are angled out.

2146
02:17:52.96 --> 02:17:56.96
So that it creates a dead space there.

2147
02:17:56.96 --> 02:18:02.96
You put a big block to see for there that you're going to designate.

2148
02:18:02.96 --> 02:18:05.96
It's the same, you know, same time you set off the clay.

2149
02:18:05.96 --> 02:18:08.96
Everything's going to go off at the same time.

2150
02:18:08.96 --> 02:18:10.96
And everybody's firing.

2151
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:18.96
And you know, the what happens is whoever's lucky enough to be standing in that dead spot.

2152
02:18:18.96 --> 02:18:20.96
Then you hit with a bullet.

2153
02:18:20.96 --> 02:18:24.96
But the concussion from that C4 stuns them.

2154
02:18:24.96 --> 02:18:25.96
Yeah.

2155
02:18:25.96 --> 02:18:26.96
And, you know, we practiced.

2156
02:18:26.96 --> 02:18:27.96
So it's stuns them.

2157
02:18:27.96 --> 02:18:32.96
And then I've got to guy with me that's designated as thumper.

2158
02:18:32.96 --> 02:18:33.96
All right.

2159
02:18:33.96 --> 02:18:36.96
So his he and I going, we're coming out of the bushes.

2160
02:18:36.96 --> 02:18:38.96
Seems that stuff goes off.

2161
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:42.96
And thumpers job is to see this guy standing there counting days.

2162
02:18:42.96 --> 02:18:44.96
And just taking down.

2163
02:18:44.96 --> 02:18:45.96
You know, thumping him into head.

2164
02:18:45.96 --> 02:18:49.96
And when he hits the ground, I'm going to hit him in the thigh with the morphing.

2165
02:18:49.96 --> 02:18:52.96
So I'm going pumping full of morphing.

2166
02:18:52.96 --> 02:18:54.96
And then he'll do whatever we say.

2167
02:18:54.96 --> 02:18:58.96
You know, he just, you know, he's just calm.

2168
02:18:58.96 --> 02:18:59.96
And.

2169
02:18:59.96 --> 02:19:04.96
But in this case, we ended up killing.

2170
02:19:04.96 --> 02:19:05.96
That guy.

2171
02:19:05.96 --> 02:19:10.96
How how when he at this point you've done how really machines had you guys taking me.

2172
02:19:10.96 --> 02:19:12.96
Cancel these in your teams yet.

2173
02:19:12.96 --> 02:19:14.96
Um, yes.

2174
02:19:14.96 --> 02:19:16.96
But I took.

2175
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:19.96
Most, I mean, a lot of people got hit.

2176
02:19:19.96 --> 02:19:27.96
But I didn't have anybody kill on one of my teams until I got to our TV.

2177
02:19:27.96 --> 02:19:28.96
Genia.

2178
02:19:28.96 --> 02:19:31.96
And you know, the point man was killed.

2179
02:19:31.96 --> 02:19:36.96
A lot of people were wounded right after I left Virginia.

2180
02:19:36.96 --> 02:19:39.96
On their next mission, they just got hammered.

2181
02:19:39.96 --> 02:19:44.96
Lawson people Americans got shot up really bad.

2182
02:19:44.96 --> 02:19:49.96
Both critical. So they were through with sod.

2183
02:19:49.96 --> 02:19:53.96
Um, but at this point you've been used to your being.

2184
02:19:53.96 --> 02:19:56.96
Continuing to be pretty lucky.

2185
02:19:56.96 --> 02:19:58.96
Yeah, it's in it is.

2186
02:19:58.96 --> 02:20:03.96
I, people asked me all the time about, you know, how do you survive that set?

2187
02:20:03.96 --> 02:20:05.96
So you got to be lucky.

2188
02:20:05.96 --> 02:20:07.96
And you call it lucky.

2189
02:20:07.96 --> 02:20:08.96
You can call it God.

2190
02:20:08.96 --> 02:20:10.96
You can call it whatever you want.

2191
02:20:10.96 --> 02:20:14.96
But there's some kind of intervention that prevents you from getting hit.

2192
02:20:14.96 --> 02:20:18.96
You can't sit in a helicopter like that first one with that many bullets.

2193
02:20:18.96 --> 02:20:20.96
Chris crossing in there and not get hit.

2194
02:20:20.96 --> 02:20:27.96
You know, and I, like, a fraction of a second between me being hit.

2195
02:20:27.96 --> 02:20:30.96
And the, you know, the other American being hit on those kids.

2196
02:20:30.96 --> 02:20:34.96
I mean, I had just pushed back when a guy pulled a trigger.

2197
02:20:34.96 --> 02:20:37.96
Miss me hit the other guy.

2198
02:20:37.96 --> 02:20:42.96
And that happened on a regular basis where, you know,

2199
02:20:42.96 --> 02:20:49.96
I, when I go speak a lot of times, if it has a, this kind of flavor to it,

2200
02:20:49.96 --> 02:20:54.96
if they say something about, you know, being in special forces is a lumping.

2201
02:20:54.96 --> 02:20:58.96
It's not unusual for people to come out to me and say,

2202
02:20:58.96 --> 02:21:01.96
I really thought you'd be taller.

2203
02:21:01.96 --> 02:21:05.96
And I said, if I'd been taller, I'd be dead.

2204
02:21:05.96 --> 02:21:08.96
I'm alive because I'm not taller.

2205
02:21:08.96 --> 02:21:11.96
My head has been creased so many times.

2206
02:21:11.96 --> 02:21:14.96
Well, I just wouldn't be here.

2207
02:21:14.96 --> 02:21:15.96
Yeah.

2208
02:21:15.96 --> 02:21:21.96
So then did you, did barswell took over for, for RT Michigan?

2209
02:21:21.96 --> 02:21:25.96
Yeah, eventually we got to the point where, I mean, barswell was ready.

2210
02:21:25.96 --> 02:21:27.96
He could have taken over before me.

2211
02:21:27.96 --> 02:21:34.96
But, so we got to the point where I had to leave to go do something different.

2212
02:21:34.96 --> 02:21:37.96
And I told him, he's ready.

2213
02:21:37.96 --> 02:21:38.96
He can do this.

2214
02:21:38.96 --> 02:21:40.96
He's a spec for.

2215
02:21:40.96 --> 02:21:40.96
Yeah.

2216
02:21:40.96 --> 02:21:43.96
With all those assets, all that response moved in.

2217
02:21:43.96 --> 02:21:45.96
And somewhere near, you got E5, I think.

2218
02:21:45.96 --> 02:21:46.96
Yeah.

2219
02:21:46.96 --> 02:21:52.96
But if you, if you were to go back and look at,

2220
02:21:52.96 --> 02:21:59.96
solid ones, zeros across the board, you would be shot at the age.

2221
02:21:59.96 --> 02:22:02.96
There's so young.

2222
02:22:02.96 --> 02:22:12.96
But, and as I've looked at, one would people do that.

2223
02:22:12.96 --> 02:22:20.96
And it used to be that neurologist thought that you're,

2224
02:22:20.96 --> 02:22:27.96
pre-chronicortex over here, where you make decisions, but it's also the part

2225
02:22:27.96 --> 02:22:32.96
that controls risk taking. They used to say, yeah, it fully

2226
02:22:32.96 --> 02:22:37.96
matures somewhere around 18 to 20 years old.

2227
02:22:37.96 --> 02:22:44.96
And now we know most people don't mature until about 28 to 30 years old.

2228
02:22:44.96 --> 02:22:45.96
So what's happening?

2229
02:22:45.96 --> 02:22:50.96
It's primarily men that don't men reach that level of maturity a little later.

2230
02:22:50.96 --> 02:22:54.96
A little bit, the women are a little behind, but in terms of the

2231
02:22:54.96 --> 02:23:00.96
sag leaders, most of them had not, definitely had not matured.

2232
02:23:00.96 --> 02:23:03.96
And I don't mean that the person was immature.

2233
02:23:03.96 --> 02:23:08.96
And I mean, they're talking that part of the brain that controls risk taking.

2234
02:23:08.96 --> 02:23:10.96
So you're young.

2235
02:23:10.96 --> 02:23:12.96
You think you're bullet proof.

2236
02:23:12.96 --> 02:23:14.96
You think you can do anything.

2237
02:23:14.96 --> 02:23:15.96
You think you're going to live forever.

2238
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:17.96
Man, this is a cool thing to do.

2239
02:23:17.96 --> 02:23:19.96
There's a sag mention.

2240
02:23:19.96 --> 02:23:21.96
So I think there's something there.

2241
02:23:21.96 --> 02:23:23.96
I'll just have a time to explore it.

2242
02:23:23.96 --> 02:23:27.96
Something there might be that the guys that are 30 years old are like, I'm not doing it.

2243
02:23:27.96 --> 02:23:29.96
Like the guy that told you don't volunteer for sock.

2244
02:23:29.96 --> 02:23:30.96
Yeah.

2245
02:23:30.96 --> 02:23:33.96
Because they're saying, yeah, this survivability's not high.

2246
02:23:33.96 --> 02:23:35.96
I've got a good, I don't know. I'm not going to do it.

2247
02:23:35.96 --> 02:23:36.96
Yeah.

2248
02:23:36.96 --> 02:23:38.96
But the young kids are right there.

2249
02:23:38.96 --> 02:23:39.96
All in.

2250
02:23:39.96 --> 02:23:40.96
Yeah.

2251
02:23:40.96 --> 02:23:42.96
How old was bargewell?

2252
02:23:42.96 --> 02:23:43.96
How old were you at this point?

2253
02:23:43.96 --> 02:23:44.96
Bargewell.

2254
02:23:44.96 --> 02:23:45.96
Bargewell.

2255
02:23:45.96 --> 02:23:49.96
I was about four or five months older than bargewell.

2256
02:23:49.96 --> 02:23:51.96
And how old were you?

2257
02:23:51.96 --> 02:23:53.96
I was about six or six years old.

2258
02:23:53.96 --> 02:23:55.96
When bargewell came along, I was about six and six.

2259
02:23:55.96 --> 02:23:56.96
I was about six and six.

2260
02:23:56.96 --> 02:23:58.96
You're 22.

2261
02:23:58.96 --> 02:23:58.96
20.

2262
02:23:58.96 --> 02:23:59.96
20.

2263
02:23:59.96 --> 02:24:00.96
Yeah.

2264
02:24:00.96 --> 02:24:04.96
I just became 22, which I didn't think I would make.

2265
02:24:04.96 --> 02:24:07.96
And I thought for sure, I won't see 20.

2266
02:24:07.96 --> 02:24:09.96
23.

2267
02:24:09.96 --> 02:24:11.96
Because I mean, weeps.

2268
02:24:11.96 --> 02:24:14.96
Obviously skipped over a lot of stuff here.

2269
02:24:14.96 --> 02:24:17.96
We're used a lot of cat lives up.

2270
02:24:17.96 --> 02:24:18.96
So.

2271
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:21.96
Yeah.

2272
02:24:21.96 --> 02:24:24.96
I mean, we were just a few months apart and turned away.

2273
02:24:24.96 --> 02:24:32.96
Well, every single one of these operations just about you're going to use a certain number of cat lives.

2274
02:24:32.96 --> 02:24:37.96
Did you ever go on an operation where you didn't get contact by the enemy?

2275
02:24:37.96 --> 02:24:38.96
No.

2276
02:24:38.96 --> 02:24:40.96
If you count the gas.

2277
02:24:40.96 --> 02:24:41.96
Mm-hmm.

2278
02:24:41.96 --> 02:24:42.96
Then no.

2279
02:24:42.96 --> 02:24:43.96
We made contact.

2280
02:24:43.96 --> 02:24:48.96
Mm-hmm.

2281
02:24:48.96 --> 02:24:49.96
100%.

2282
02:24:49.96 --> 02:24:51.96
You're going to get an contact with the enemy.

2283
02:24:51.96 --> 02:24:53.96
All right.

2284
02:24:53.96 --> 02:24:54.96
Well, it was the operation.

2285
02:24:54.96 --> 02:24:56.96
Shileau all about.

2286
02:24:56.96 --> 02:24:57.96
And is this why you left RT Michigan?

2287
02:24:57.96 --> 02:24:58.96
Yeah.

2288
02:24:58.96 --> 02:24:59.96
Okay.

2289
02:24:59.96 --> 02:25:00.96
So you get called away from RT Michigan.

2290
02:25:00.96 --> 02:25:01.96
They need somebody to do operation.

2291
02:25:01.96 --> 02:25:02.96
So what was that all about?

2292
02:25:02.96 --> 02:25:04.96
They make me sag.

2293
02:25:04.96 --> 02:25:07.96
And somebody higher up.

2294
02:25:07.96 --> 02:25:12.96
And decided that they needed to stop the influx of supplies.

2295
02:25:12.96 --> 02:25:17.96
And that troops coming down from the north.

2296
02:25:17.96 --> 02:25:23.96
And it was a place called the Mugia Pass.

2297
02:25:23.96 --> 02:25:25.96
Big, deep valley.

2298
02:25:25.96 --> 02:25:28.96
But there was a point where it really narrowed up the bank.

2299
02:25:28.96 --> 02:25:31.96
It was really steep and high.

2300
02:25:31.96 --> 02:25:37.96
And you know, so they had to funnel through that pass with their trucks and people and whatever

2301
02:25:37.96 --> 02:25:40.96
to come on down into the south.

2302
02:25:40.96 --> 02:25:45.96
And you know, you send a forward air controller out there.

2303
02:25:45.96 --> 02:25:46.96
I mean, they see it.

2304
02:25:46.96 --> 02:25:52.96
So they pull off in the hide because they know that forward air controller has a bunch of

2305
02:25:52.96 --> 02:25:53.96
L-flowers over here in orbit.

2306
02:25:53.96 --> 02:25:57.96
Just waiting on him to find a target and they're going to come in.

2307
02:25:57.96 --> 02:26:04.96
So somebody came up with the idea of what if we put a team out there up on the ridge,

2308
02:26:04.96 --> 02:26:08.96
upon the crest of that valley looking down.

2309
02:26:08.96 --> 02:26:14.96
And they'll be able to see for enough that when they're coming, they can call and say,

2310
02:26:14.96 --> 02:26:15.96
OK, they're on their way.

2311
02:26:15.96 --> 02:26:18.96
Scram, you know, get the L-flow out here.

2312
02:26:18.96 --> 02:26:19.96
And they all four can be on.

2313
02:26:19.96 --> 02:26:24.96
I'm like a chicken on a jean bird and just eat them up, you know.

2314
02:26:24.96 --> 02:26:29.96
So they decided to do this mission.

2315
02:26:29.96 --> 02:26:31.96
Little sneak people sneak a team out there.

2316
02:26:31.96 --> 02:26:32.96
Put them on the ridge.

2317
02:26:32.96 --> 02:26:37.96
Let them set up there and just interdick this place like crazy.

2318
02:26:37.96 --> 02:26:40.96
But it has to be a super team.

2319
02:26:40.96 --> 02:26:43.96
It has to be off as they're led.

2320
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:50.96
It has to, all Americans have to be approved by by name, by the president to do this,

2321
02:26:50.96 --> 02:26:53.96
because they're where it is and what they're going to do.

2322
02:26:53.96 --> 02:27:03.96
So they needed somebody a 1-0 officer who could take over a team that we had there and, you know,

2323
02:27:03.96 --> 02:27:07.96
they were leading it and they put me on it.

2324
02:27:07.96 --> 02:27:15.96
I wasn't happy about leaving Michigan, but I thought, well, this sounds cool until I learn more about what they were going to do.

2325
02:27:15.96 --> 02:27:18.96
And I went on a visual recon.

2326
02:27:18.96 --> 02:27:20.96
I went out and rode with a forward air controller,

2327
02:27:20.96 --> 02:27:27.96
if I was putting in air strikes with their force and I'm looking at this place and I'm thinking,

2328
02:27:27.96 --> 02:27:32.96
they just got to be somebody up there.

2329
02:27:32.96 --> 02:27:33.96
They're not high ground.

2330
02:27:33.96 --> 02:27:36.96
They're not leaving this place and defended.

2331
02:27:36.96 --> 02:27:40.96
And when I brought that up, they said, no, there's nobody there.

2332
02:27:40.96 --> 02:27:44.96
We never received any fire from that area.

2333
02:27:44.96 --> 02:27:51.96
And I said, if you don't want people to know you're there, you don't shoot out them.

2334
02:27:51.96 --> 02:27:54.96
So there's somebody, I'm sure there's somebody there.

2335
02:27:54.96 --> 02:28:00.96
And anyway, so I had some disagreements with the people doing in Saigon about that.

2336
02:28:00.96 --> 02:28:04.96
And I had to go back and forth on a lot of briefings about the mission.

2337
02:28:04.96 --> 02:28:06.96
But we took the other team.

2338
02:28:06.96 --> 02:28:09.96
All right, took the team and we trained and we'd go to Mucky Mountain.

2339
02:28:09.96 --> 02:28:13.96
And we'd practice all this stuff and our surveillance techniques.

2340
02:28:13.96 --> 02:28:14.96
And we had the starlight scopes.

2341
02:28:14.96 --> 02:28:17.96
We had long rains, lenses on our cameras.

2342
02:28:17.96 --> 02:28:20.96
And all the state of the art binoculars.

2343
02:28:20.96 --> 02:28:27.96
We had a plan that said, I thought it was funny that we're going to drop parachutes out.

2344
02:28:27.96 --> 02:28:31.96
And an area over a wave from there.

2345
02:28:31.96 --> 02:28:34.96
We'd box up ice in them.

2346
02:28:34.96 --> 02:28:37.96
So the parachutes will open.

2347
02:28:37.96 --> 02:28:40.96
Just seeing, hanging the trees, ice them out.

2348
02:28:40.96 --> 02:28:47.96
So when the NVA go over there, they'll think we parachuted some people in and they moved out.

2349
02:28:47.96 --> 02:28:50.96
Because they won't see anybody.

2350
02:28:50.96 --> 02:28:52.96
They're not stupid.

2351
02:28:52.96 --> 02:28:58.96
Anyway, so for four weeks we get ready to go do this thing.

2352
02:28:58.96 --> 02:29:04.96
And then finally somebody listened and said, no, call it off.

2353
02:29:04.96 --> 02:29:06.96
We're not going to do it.

2354
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:12.96
And till talk to you and one of your podcasts about where he had the special mission.

2355
02:29:12.96 --> 02:29:16.96
They had to have an officer with him later on.

2356
02:29:16.96 --> 02:29:22.96
After I left, it came back up again. They decided to do it and they put an officer with his team.

2357
02:29:22.96 --> 02:29:24.96
And said, you guys are going to do it.

2358
02:29:24.96 --> 02:29:27.96
And they were out on the Hello Pad with the roaders turning.

2359
02:29:27.96 --> 02:29:32.96
And when the mission got called off because they discovered there were a bunch of people there.

2360
02:29:32.96 --> 02:29:38.96
And if they had put either one of those teams in, when we lost the house.

2361
02:29:38.96 --> 02:29:42.96
How about Dick Meadows?

2362
02:29:42.96 --> 02:29:47.96
Now, now legend. Now this is an easy legend at this time.

2363
02:29:47.96 --> 02:29:48.96
Oh, yeah.

2364
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:52.96
Everybody already knew Dick Meadows.

2365
02:29:52.96 --> 02:30:00.96
Meadows had been, he got to the point where he done all his super secret stuff.

2366
02:30:00.96 --> 02:30:04.96
And they said, okay, we're going to give you a choice.

2367
02:30:04.96 --> 02:30:07.96
You can, we can promote you to Sergeant Major.

2368
02:30:07.96 --> 02:30:10.96
Or we can promote you to Captain.

2369
02:30:10.96 --> 02:30:13.96
Which one do you want?

2370
02:30:13.96 --> 02:30:18.96
And he worked out a deal that said, if you promote me to Captain,

2371
02:30:18.96 --> 02:30:22.96
then I get to stay, you can't force me out.

2372
02:30:22.96 --> 02:30:25.96
I get to stay in until I can retire.

2373
02:30:25.96 --> 02:30:29.96
You know, as an officer, whatever, right, I get to.

2374
02:30:29.96 --> 02:30:31.96
So anyway, so he's, she's, she's.

2375
02:30:31.96 --> 02:30:37.96
This is, I don't know if this is the army or if it's just Vietnam.

2376
02:30:37.96 --> 02:30:39.96
I think it's a little bit of both.

2377
02:30:39.96 --> 02:30:42.96
That kind of thing just doesn't happen anymore.

2378
02:30:42.96 --> 02:30:47.96
Where they take a guy that go, hey, we're going to either promote you to the Senior

2379
02:30:47.96 --> 02:30:50.96
and Listed Side or make you a captain, which one do you want?

2380
02:30:50.96 --> 02:30:51.96
Yeah.

2381
02:30:51.96 --> 02:30:52.96
That's epic.

2382
02:30:52.96 --> 02:30:52.96
Yeah.

2383
02:30:52.96 --> 02:30:54.96
And Meadows, it wasn't epic guy.

2384
02:30:54.96 --> 02:30:55.96
Yeah.

2385
02:30:55.96 --> 02:31:00.96
I mean, so, you know, I came back from a mission.

2386
02:31:00.96 --> 02:31:05.96
And I was told that we got a new company commander.

2387
02:31:05.96 --> 02:31:09.96
And he wants to see you as soon as you get cleaned up.

2388
02:31:09.96 --> 02:31:12.96
So I got in to see him that night.

2389
02:31:12.96 --> 02:31:14.96
It was probably 2200.

2390
02:31:14.96 --> 02:31:18.96
And actually he was, the quarters were, it was a,

2391
02:31:18.96 --> 02:31:20.96
a quansit hut with the wall.

2392
02:31:20.96 --> 02:31:21.96
I was on one side of it.

2393
02:31:21.96 --> 02:31:23.96
He was on the other side.

2394
02:31:23.96 --> 02:31:25.96
So I go over and report to him.

2395
02:31:25.96 --> 02:31:27.96
And, you know, he told me, good job.

2396
02:31:27.96 --> 02:31:28.96
And all this stuff.

2397
02:31:28.96 --> 02:31:29.96
I've been looking at you record.

2398
02:31:29.96 --> 02:31:31.96
And he said, effective right now.

2399
02:31:31.96 --> 02:31:34.96
You're the recon company, ex-o.

2400
02:31:34.96 --> 02:31:37.96
And he said, but I don't want to go off team.

2401
02:31:37.96 --> 02:31:38.96
And he said, you can keep a team.

2402
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:40.96
I don't care about that.

2403
02:31:40.96 --> 02:31:41.96
But you're the ex-o.

2404
02:31:41.96 --> 02:31:43.96
And you're going to help me.

2405
02:31:43.96 --> 02:31:47.96
And he said, to start with tomorrow morning,

2406
02:31:47.96 --> 02:31:52.96
we're going to have a meeting with all the Americans in

2407
02:31:52.96 --> 02:31:56.96
Recon company one at a time.

2408
02:31:56.96 --> 02:31:59.96
Because I've been going through the records.

2409
02:31:59.96 --> 02:32:03.96
And I think the sum of them's Borei has gotten a little too heavy.

2410
02:32:03.96 --> 02:32:05.96
And we're going to send them back to the train tomorrow.

2411
02:32:05.96 --> 02:32:07.96
They don't need to be in stock.

2412
02:32:07.96 --> 02:32:09.96
They can go play with special forces.

2413
02:32:09.96 --> 02:32:11.96
But they're not going to be in stock.

2414
02:32:11.96 --> 02:32:13.96
What do you mean?

2415
02:32:13.96 --> 02:32:18.96
He said, there are people here who are not going out on missions.

2416
02:32:18.96 --> 02:32:20.96
Very often.

2417
02:32:20.96 --> 02:32:22.96
And going out on missions.

2418
02:32:22.96 --> 02:32:26.96
And every time they get shot off the LZ, they never actually

2419
02:32:26.96 --> 02:32:27.96
complete a mission.

2420
02:32:27.96 --> 02:32:29.96
And they're going to be in stock.

2421
02:32:29.96 --> 02:32:33.96
They need to go somewhere else.

2422
02:32:33.96 --> 02:32:35.96
And we need to replace them.

2423
02:32:35.96 --> 02:32:39.96
And then, if that is as hard to do, I'm hard.

2424
02:32:39.96 --> 02:32:41.96
And you can tell when he's talking to you.

2425
02:32:41.96 --> 02:32:45.96
He is the serious, the hard attack.

2426
02:32:45.96 --> 02:32:47.96
So he said, here.

2427
02:32:47.96 --> 02:32:49.96
Take this stack of files with you.

2428
02:32:49.96 --> 02:32:51.96
Go through them tonight.

2429
02:32:51.96 --> 02:32:55.96
Tomorrow morning at 0700, they're going to start with you.

2430
02:32:55.96 --> 02:32:59.96
And the other weekend, the other weekend, the other weekend,

2431
02:32:59.96 --> 02:33:01.96
the other weekend, the other weekend, the other weekend.

2432
02:33:01.96 --> 02:33:03.96
So we're going to start coming in the other weekend or early room.

2433
02:33:03.96 --> 02:33:05.96
And I'm going to have a talk with her.

2434
02:33:05.96 --> 02:33:09.96
So you tell me which ones you think you need to go home.

2435
02:33:09.96 --> 02:33:11.96
So we met in the next morning.

2436
02:33:11.96 --> 02:33:15.96
And I'm looking at the list that the stack is.

2437
02:33:15.96 --> 02:33:17.96
You've got the idea to be a place that's in the back.

2438
02:33:17.96 --> 02:33:21.96
I said, we're not going to have anybody left.

2439
02:33:21.96 --> 02:33:23.96
And he said, I don't care.

2440
02:33:23.96 --> 02:33:27.96
If we have to, you and I will lead all the missions.

2441
02:33:27.96 --> 02:33:31.96
And my heart's not beating at this point.

2442
02:33:31.96 --> 02:33:35.96
Because I'm hearing how serious he is in his bars.

2443
02:33:35.96 --> 02:33:37.96
We'll do it all.

2444
02:33:37.96 --> 02:33:39.96
Yes, sir.

2445
02:33:39.96 --> 02:33:43.96
We're going to become busy.

2446
02:33:43.96 --> 02:33:47.96
But anyway, he went and sent him home.

2447
02:33:47.96 --> 02:33:51.96
But he sent a lot of people back to the train that day.

2448
02:33:51.96 --> 02:33:53.96
He said, it's dull.

2449
02:33:53.96 --> 02:33:55.96
You helicopter's leaving this afternoon.

2450
02:33:55.96 --> 02:33:57.96
Beyond it.

2451
02:33:57.96 --> 02:33:59.96
And he started to shut the people back down there.

2452
02:33:59.96 --> 02:34:05.96
You know, if you had been dragging your feet, finding ways not to go on missions,

2453
02:34:05.96 --> 02:34:07.96
you were sick, you were whatever.

2454
02:34:07.96 --> 02:34:09.96
And you get shot off the LZ.

2455
02:34:09.96 --> 02:34:13.96
I mean, he looked at, you know, over the period of time,

2456
02:34:13.96 --> 02:34:15.96
you had been there.

2457
02:34:15.96 --> 02:34:17.96
How many missions had you been on?

2458
02:34:17.96 --> 02:34:19.96
How many times have you been in contact?

2459
02:34:19.96 --> 02:34:21.96
You've been on the ground.

2460
02:34:21.96 --> 02:34:23.96
And all this kind of stuff.

2461
02:34:23.96 --> 02:34:25.96
And, you know, he had his own little equation.

2462
02:34:25.96 --> 02:34:29.96
And, you know, these people needed to find something else to do.

2463
02:34:29.96 --> 02:34:33.96
And he was hard.

2464
02:34:33.96 --> 02:34:37.96
Big-time ranger, special ops, mindset.

2465
02:34:37.96 --> 02:34:39.96
And he started to look around right away.

2466
02:34:39.96 --> 02:34:41.96
And I just got a thing here.

2467
02:34:41.96 --> 02:34:43.96
We got to clean up.

2468
02:34:43.96 --> 02:34:45.96
We should have a nice isolation area.

2469
02:34:45.96 --> 02:34:47.96
When a team gets a mission, you go into isolation.

2470
02:34:47.96 --> 02:34:49.96
So he's done special forces.

2471
02:34:49.96 --> 02:34:50.96
That's the doctrine.

2472
02:34:50.96 --> 02:34:51.96
And we're not doing it.

2473
02:34:51.96 --> 02:34:53.96
Why would we not do that here?

2474
02:34:53.96 --> 02:34:55.96
A lot of things like that.

2475
02:34:55.96 --> 02:34:57.96
Training.

2476
02:34:57.96 --> 02:35:01.96
So I, you know, he told me, let's, the next morning, he said,

2477
02:35:01.96 --> 02:35:03.96
you meet me down on the beach.

2478
02:35:03.96 --> 02:35:05.96
And then tomorrow morning,

2479
02:35:05.96 --> 02:35:07.96
the beach was just right outside the casino.

2480
02:35:07.96 --> 02:35:09.96
Time made him down there and he said,

2481
02:35:09.96 --> 02:35:11.96
we're going to go for a little run.

2482
02:35:11.96 --> 02:35:15.96
And, you know, he, you can tell the older than me.

2483
02:35:15.96 --> 02:35:17.96
He's at that point.

2484
02:35:17.96 --> 02:35:21.96
So we take off down the beach about a seven minute pace.

2485
02:35:21.96 --> 02:35:25.96
And I'm thinking, oh my god, I haven't been running.

2486
02:35:25.96 --> 02:35:29.96
I mean, I'm starting to, you know, suck a little win in here.

2487
02:35:29.96 --> 02:35:31.96
And this dopers not slowing down.

2488
02:35:31.96 --> 02:35:35.96
So when we get about the two mile point, you know, I, I told him,

2489
02:35:35.96 --> 02:35:39.96
I said, sir, I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and turn around here

2490
02:35:39.96 --> 02:35:41.96
and go back and take care of some things.

2491
02:35:41.96 --> 02:35:43.96
You do that lieutenant.

2492
02:35:43.96 --> 02:35:45.96
I'm going to keep running.

2493
02:35:45.96 --> 02:35:47.96
And he kept going and I look back at once a while,

2494
02:35:47.96 --> 02:35:49.96
so he disappeared out of sight down the beach.

2495
02:35:49.96 --> 02:35:51.96
And he's by himself and he's unarmed.

2496
02:35:51.96 --> 02:35:55.96
And, you know, late on, he came back.

2497
02:35:55.96 --> 02:36:01.96
I mean, physical fitness was a, a big thing for him.

2498
02:36:01.96 --> 02:36:05.96
You keep your body sharp, you'll keep your mind sharp.

2499
02:36:05.96 --> 02:36:09.96
And, you know, we started to have in PT in the mornings

2500
02:36:09.96 --> 02:36:11.96
for the teams that were not out enough Hill.

2501
02:36:11.96 --> 02:36:13.96
Things like that.

2502
02:36:13.96 --> 02:36:15.96
So you made a lot of changes.

2503
02:36:15.96 --> 02:36:19.96
How did that affect the attitude around the camp?

2504
02:36:19.96 --> 02:36:23.96
I have to, I have to kill his house cleaning at the, at the beginning.

2505
02:36:23.96 --> 02:36:25.96
Every flight to Elsa is Yasser or whatever you want.

2506
02:36:25.96 --> 02:36:29.96
I mean, we need to do this stuff and we need to do it right.

2507
02:36:29.96 --> 02:36:31.96
And, you know, he was out there.

2508
02:36:31.96 --> 02:36:35.96
I mean, and everybody knew, I mean, he's a guy that would say,

2509
02:36:35.96 --> 02:36:39.96
you've been out twice to get a prisoner.

2510
02:36:39.96 --> 02:36:43.96
I'm going with you this time and show you how to get one.

2511
02:36:43.96 --> 02:36:47.96
And he's going to get one and bring it back.

2512
02:36:47.96 --> 02:36:51.96
I mean, whatever the mission was, he could do it.

2513
02:36:51.96 --> 02:36:55.96
And then say, now I want the rest of you to do it that way.

2514
02:36:55.96 --> 02:36:59.96
And, oh, I can't Roger that.

2515
02:36:59.96 --> 02:37:03.96
Whatever you say, so he said, you can keep a team,

2516
02:37:03.96 --> 02:37:05.96
but here's the time we're going to start.

2517
02:37:05.96 --> 02:37:07.96
We've got a group coming over.

2518
02:37:07.96 --> 02:37:10.96
The first group in Oca Noa were sending people over,

2519
02:37:10.96 --> 02:37:11.96
temporary duty.

2520
02:37:11.96 --> 02:37:15.96
It had sent four teams of Americans over.

2521
02:37:15.96 --> 02:37:18.96
And he said, I want you to train them.

2522
02:37:18.96 --> 02:37:25.96
So when they get here, you get with them and their teams and you put them through some training on how to run these operations and what to do.

2523
02:37:25.96 --> 02:37:29.96
And then I want you to go out with them with each team.

2524
02:37:29.96 --> 02:37:30.96
You take them out.

2525
02:37:30.96 --> 02:37:34.96
You walk right alongside, you know, the one zero.

2526
02:37:34.96 --> 02:37:36.96
I guess we call that skin in the game.

2527
02:37:36.96 --> 02:37:39.96
You're going to trade them and they're going to go with them.

2528
02:37:39.96 --> 02:37:44.96
And, you know, when you get a team, you think is ready to go.

2529
02:37:44.96 --> 02:37:47.96
You tell me, we'll sign a mission to them and you take the next team out.

2530
02:37:47.96 --> 02:37:49.96
Are these the snake bite teams?

2531
02:37:49.96 --> 02:37:50.96
Yeah, these are all the same.

2532
02:37:50.96 --> 02:37:51.96
Yeah, it's not like.

2533
02:37:51.96 --> 02:37:55.96
So, you know, I was going out on regular races with these guys.

2534
02:37:55.96 --> 02:37:57.96
You know, particularly once I got them trained.

2535
02:37:57.96 --> 02:38:05.96
And, you know, we were going into the marine forest recons area of operations.

2536
02:38:05.96 --> 02:38:11.96
You know, they would put their teams out there within two or three days.

2537
02:38:11.96 --> 02:38:14.96
You know, they'd get run out.

2538
02:38:14.96 --> 02:38:19.96
We were going out and the objective was to stay seven days.

2539
02:38:19.96 --> 02:38:24.96
And she's, I mean, we, you know, we eventually might contact.

2540
02:38:24.96 --> 02:38:26.96
Sometimes we might contact before that.

2541
02:38:26.96 --> 02:38:33.96
But it was a live fire, you know, shoot back target kind of certification.

2542
02:38:33.96 --> 02:38:40.96
So, can you lead a team out against real bad guys and get shot at and do it right.

2543
02:38:40.96 --> 02:38:43.96
And then I give them the check mark.

2544
02:38:43.96 --> 02:38:44.96
Then they get a sawed mission.

2545
02:38:44.96 --> 02:38:46.96
So, those are the elephant alley operations.

2546
02:38:46.96 --> 02:38:47.96
Yeah.

2547
02:38:47.96 --> 02:38:48.96
Is that what those are.

2548
02:38:48.96 --> 02:38:50.96
So, you had an AO that was a little bit calmer.

2549
02:38:50.96 --> 02:38:51.96
It was a little bit closer.

2550
02:38:51.96 --> 02:38:53.96
We still had some real bad guys.

2551
02:38:53.96 --> 02:38:56.96
This is just like the ultimate in training operations.

2552
02:38:56.96 --> 02:38:56.96
Yes.

2553
02:38:56.96 --> 02:38:57.96
Because it's actually real.

2554
02:38:57.96 --> 02:38:58.96
Yeah.

2555
02:38:58.96 --> 02:38:59.96
Because the target shoot back.

2556
02:38:59.96 --> 02:39:01.96
And we had several elements wanted.

2557
02:39:01.96 --> 02:39:04.96
You know, from the home of the missions.

2558
02:39:04.96 --> 02:39:07.96
But, you know, they always did a great job.

2559
02:39:07.96 --> 02:39:10.96
I mean, when they were there, they did a great job.

2560
02:39:10.96 --> 02:39:13.96
So, he kept me busy with that.

2561
02:39:13.96 --> 02:39:18.96
But, so I was technically still going out with teams.

2562
02:39:18.96 --> 02:39:20.96
I wasn't happy about it.

2563
02:39:20.96 --> 02:39:22.96
I mean, real sawed missions.

2564
02:39:22.96 --> 02:39:24.96
I don't want to, you know,

2565
02:39:24.96 --> 02:39:27.96
It does even count as your sawed missions.

2566
02:39:27.96 --> 02:39:28.96
No.

2567
02:39:28.96 --> 02:39:31.96
Those were just day to day stuff.

2568
02:39:31.96 --> 02:39:34.96
You know, you know, trying to get a kill while you're doing it.

2569
02:39:34.96 --> 02:39:35.96
Yeah.

2570
02:39:35.96 --> 02:39:36.96
You just go do that.

2571
02:39:36.96 --> 02:39:39.96
And, you know, ironically enough,

2572
02:39:39.96 --> 02:39:45.96
that was very similar to what it was like,

2573
02:39:45.96 --> 02:39:50.96
you know, when I came home and went to the Ranger Department and became a Ranger instructor.

2574
02:39:50.96 --> 02:39:51.96
That's what I did.

2575
02:39:51.96 --> 02:39:55.96
And I was walking along, you know, with a team of Ranger students,

2576
02:39:55.96 --> 02:39:59.96
upgrading and evaluating the patrol leaders.

2577
02:39:59.96 --> 02:40:02.96
So, he said, the target since he back.

2578
02:40:02.96 --> 02:40:03.96
Mm-hmm.

2579
02:40:03.96 --> 02:40:05.96
But that's a little bit of a difference.

2580
02:40:05.96 --> 02:40:06.96
Yeah.

2581
02:40:06.96 --> 02:40:09.96
And then when did you take over RT Virginia?

2582
02:40:09.96 --> 02:40:12.96
Was that your next one zero?

2583
02:40:12.96 --> 02:40:14.96
Yeah.

2584
02:40:14.96 --> 02:40:17.96
And we finished with the snake bites.

2585
02:40:17.96 --> 02:40:24.96
And he said, okay, I got one more mission for you before you get your real team back again.

2586
02:40:24.96 --> 02:40:33.96
And he said, we've got a team that we want to convert over to Vietnamese lead team.

2587
02:40:33.96 --> 02:40:38.96
So, it's going to be a team that's going to operate with no Americans on it.

2588
02:40:38.96 --> 02:40:45.96
We've got Vietnamese Army captain that's coming in here.

2589
02:40:45.96 --> 02:40:49.96
So he'll be the team leader and we've got RT Virginia.

2590
02:40:49.96 --> 02:40:54.96
And he hasn't nobody right now.

2591
02:40:54.96 --> 02:40:57.96
So I want you to train them with him.

2592
02:40:57.96 --> 02:41:02.96
And then you can take them out on a mission and make sure he does okay.

2593
02:41:02.96 --> 02:41:10.96
And if he does okay, then, you know, he will take over the team and he'll start getting, you know,

2594
02:41:10.96 --> 02:41:12.96
Sog missions.

2595
02:41:12.96 --> 02:41:18.96
So, as soon as I got with the team, they were saying, no, no.

2596
02:41:18.96 --> 02:41:22.96
And we don't want Vietnamese captain.

2597
02:41:22.96 --> 02:41:25.96
And I don't know, whatever it's just something about them.

2598
02:41:25.96 --> 02:41:27.96
We blinded very quickly.

2599
02:41:27.96 --> 02:41:30.96
And then they started saying, we want you.

2600
02:41:30.96 --> 02:41:31.96
I said, it can't be me.

2601
02:41:31.96 --> 02:41:32.96
It's got to be this guy.

2602
02:41:32.96 --> 02:41:36.96
So we're going to go train and they were good.

2603
02:41:36.96 --> 02:41:37.96
And I liked them.

2604
02:41:37.96 --> 02:41:39.96
We got along well.

2605
02:41:39.96 --> 02:41:42.96
But they did not like the captain.

2606
02:41:42.96 --> 02:41:47.96
So in the end, in the middle said, okay, you take the team.

2607
02:41:47.96 --> 02:41:50.96
You've been all this time with them.

2608
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:53.96
You take them and go with them.

2609
02:41:53.96 --> 02:41:55.96
And then what were those missions?

2610
02:41:55.96 --> 02:41:56.96
Then you started doing it.

2611
02:41:56.96 --> 02:41:57.96
Sog missions.

2612
02:41:57.96 --> 02:41:58.96
Sog missions.

2613
02:41:58.96 --> 02:41:59.96
Yeah.

2614
02:41:59.96 --> 02:42:00.96
Because they were good.

2615
02:42:00.96 --> 02:42:03.96
And how many times did you go out with R.T. Virginia?

2616
02:42:03.96 --> 02:42:04.96
A bunch.

2617
02:42:04.96 --> 02:42:05.96
I don't know.

2618
02:42:05.96 --> 02:42:07.96
I'd have to go ahead and count them now.

2619
02:42:07.96 --> 02:42:08.96
But, yeah.

2620
02:42:08.96 --> 02:42:12.96
I mean, that was the last team, you know, that was the ones zero.

2621
02:42:12.96 --> 02:42:16.96
And so these missions are the same, you know, you're going deep into me territory.

2622
02:42:16.96 --> 02:42:25.96
Across the fence, as tilt says, inserting and trying to do recon, trying to find intelligence,

2623
02:42:25.96 --> 02:42:31.96
trying to plant sensors and trying to avoid hundreds, if not thousands of NBA.

2624
02:42:31.96 --> 02:42:36.96
And sometimes you went out looking for a large unit.

2625
02:42:36.96 --> 02:42:37.96
That was the mission.

2626
02:42:37.96 --> 02:42:41.96
You go find them and once you find them, then you've got them located.

2627
02:42:41.96 --> 02:42:42.96
You bring the world.

2628
02:42:42.96 --> 02:42:47.96
I mean, you introduce them to, you know, what we call later, chalk and all.

2629
02:42:47.96 --> 02:42:52.96
I mean, you bring all this down from because they can't get away once you know where they are.

2630
02:42:52.96 --> 02:42:55.96
So those are some of those were just straight up patrol to contact.

2631
02:42:55.96 --> 02:42:58.96
You're going to go in there and you're going to patrol until you find somebody.

2632
02:42:58.96 --> 02:42:59.96
And then you're going to call the fighter.

2633
02:42:59.96 --> 02:43:01.96
You go do that.

2634
02:43:01.96 --> 02:43:10.96
And I think we, I had an in-country mission with Virginia, but I think the first out-of-country was what we sometimes call the

2635
02:43:10.96 --> 02:43:13.96
suicide mission.

2636
02:43:13.96 --> 02:43:15.96
We put in two teams.

2637
02:43:15.96 --> 02:43:18.96
Once we got on the ground, we'd separate.

2638
02:43:18.96 --> 02:43:22.96
For you to be calling the suicide mission is a real statement about things.

2639
02:43:22.96 --> 02:43:24.96
So we would separate.

2640
02:43:24.96 --> 02:43:27.96
This should be called the guaranteed death mission.

2641
02:43:27.96 --> 02:43:28.96
But okay, we'll go with it.

2642
02:43:28.96 --> 02:43:29.96
It's the suicide mission.

2643
02:43:29.96 --> 02:43:34.96
And one team would be the, the real team that was going to stay out there.

2644
02:43:34.96 --> 02:43:39.96
The suicide team would be the one that was going to go.

2645
02:43:39.96 --> 02:43:41.96
So they would be the first to make contact as soon as possible.

2646
02:43:41.96 --> 02:43:42.96
Go find them.

2647
02:43:42.96 --> 02:43:43.96
Pound saw them.

2648
02:43:43.96 --> 02:43:45.96
You know, they do as much damage as you could.

2649
02:43:45.96 --> 02:43:48.96
Bring in the world, get extracted and go away.

2650
02:43:48.96 --> 02:43:51.96
But the other team's still out there.

2651
02:43:51.96 --> 02:43:54.96
And nobody knows that they're out there now.

2652
02:43:54.96 --> 02:43:55.96
They think.

2653
02:43:55.96 --> 02:43:58.96
You know, that was who got extracted.

2654
02:43:58.96 --> 02:44:03.96
So, you know, it was go get, so we went out and you know,

2655
02:44:03.96 --> 02:44:07.96
sure enough, it didn't take us long to find, you know,

2656
02:44:07.96 --> 02:44:11.20
of a container or so of people.

2657
02:44:11.20 --> 02:44:14.76
And so we're online and we open fire on them.

2658
02:44:14.76 --> 02:44:17.24
I mean, normally just start out like that,

2659
02:44:17.24 --> 02:44:21.20
put that to see them and I started shooting at them.

2660
02:44:21.20 --> 02:44:22.84
They started shooting back.

2661
02:44:22.84 --> 02:44:25.76
And it was funny that what happened, we were online.

2662
02:44:25.76 --> 02:44:29.92
And as soon as all the bullets started coming back,

2663
02:44:29.92 --> 02:44:31.48
it was soon.

2664
02:44:31.48 --> 02:44:32.96
They were all right here with me.

2665
02:44:32.96 --> 02:44:34.84
And I'm saying, what are you doing?

2666
02:44:34.84 --> 02:44:36.84
And I said, spread out.

2667
02:44:36.84 --> 02:44:38.24
You can't be here with me.

2668
02:44:38.24 --> 02:44:40.96
I mean, one before you take us all out.

2669
02:44:40.96 --> 02:44:47.36
And I had to smoke them a little bit and spread back out.

2670
02:44:47.36 --> 02:44:49.48
Disperse them is what we call that.

2671
02:44:49.48 --> 02:44:52.20
And we don't also say don't bunch up.

2672
02:44:52.20 --> 02:44:53.84
And I would think about the psychology of what

2673
02:44:53.84 --> 02:44:56.24
makes people bunch up like that.

2674
02:44:56.24 --> 02:44:57.88
And part of it, I think, is just fear.

2675
02:44:57.88 --> 02:44:59.60
And like you want to be next to someone else.

2676
02:44:59.60 --> 02:45:00.88
You want to have your buddy.

2677
02:45:00.88 --> 02:45:02.44
And so as soon as bullets start flying,

2678
02:45:02.44 --> 02:45:05.20
it's like I'm going to get next to you because we'll be together.

2679
02:45:05.20 --> 02:45:06.80
And I feel better when we're together.

2680
02:45:06.80 --> 02:45:08.76
And the other thing, I think, is just communication.

2681
02:45:08.76 --> 02:45:09.84
People want to hear what's happening.

2682
02:45:09.84 --> 02:45:10.96
People want to know what's happening.

2683
02:45:10.96 --> 02:45:12.84
And so they figure, well, the bosses right there,

2684
02:45:12.84 --> 02:45:15.08
I'll go get what the boss that I'll know what's happening.

2685
02:45:15.08 --> 02:45:17.16
And then that's where everyone else in the team thinks.

2686
02:45:17.16 --> 02:45:19.80
And next to you, you're too close.

2687
02:45:19.80 --> 02:45:20.80
Yeah.

2688
02:45:20.80 --> 02:45:21.32
You can't do that.

2689
02:45:21.32 --> 02:45:23.12
They knew I had to radio.

2690
02:45:23.12 --> 02:45:24.56
So were you the suicide team?

2691
02:45:24.56 --> 02:45:25.56
Were you the assault team?

2692
02:45:25.56 --> 02:45:26.84
And then someone else was going to stay out there.

2693
02:45:26.84 --> 02:45:29.04
They were going to go to the side team.

2694
02:45:29.04 --> 02:45:34.88
So we hammered that group, which grew, once we started hitting them.

2695
02:45:34.88 --> 02:45:38.36
And then we just got bringing in enough air power to eventually

2696
02:45:38.36 --> 02:45:42.72
we suppressed it enough that we could get extracted.

2697
02:45:42.72 --> 02:45:43.60
So that was.

2698
02:45:43.60 --> 02:45:51.60
But we had been in contact once before the end-country mission.

2699
02:45:51.60 --> 02:45:53.04
But yeah.

2700
02:45:53.04 --> 02:45:55.08
I mean, that was a little issue.

2701
02:45:55.08 --> 02:45:56.68
But we got that resolved.

2702
02:45:56.68 --> 02:45:58.80
You know, maintained in this version.

2703
02:45:58.80 --> 02:46:01.84
And following whatever the media action drill was.

2704
02:46:01.84 --> 02:46:04.56
But they were good team.

2705
02:46:04.56 --> 02:46:10.24
I mean, they reacted normally very well under fire.

2706
02:46:10.24 --> 02:46:13.40
And were those, were those, those were Vietnamese?

2707
02:46:13.40 --> 02:46:14.56
Yeah.

2708
02:46:14.56 --> 02:46:20.56
So with that, you wrap up with RT Virginia.

2709
02:46:20.56 --> 02:46:23.16
And you get some RNR.

2710
02:46:23.16 --> 02:46:27.92
And you actually have a document that you gave me about this RNR.

2711
02:46:27.92 --> 02:46:30.48
And RNR, if you don't know, is rest in recuperation.

2712
02:46:30.48 --> 02:46:35.64
And we're actually going to cover that on the next podcast.

2713
02:46:35.64 --> 02:46:38.64
So thanks for coming on.

2714
02:46:38.64 --> 02:46:48.60
And we'll fill these people in on this insane operation that is titled Rest in

2715
02:46:48.60 --> 02:46:50.04
Recuperation.

2716
02:46:50.04 --> 02:46:51.04
So thanks for coming out.

2717
02:46:51.04 --> 02:46:52.04
Thank you for having me.

2718
02:46:52.04 --> 02:46:54.04
And we'll talk right into the next one.

2719
02:46:54.04 --> 02:46:55.68
Thank you.

2720
02:46:55.68 --> 02:47:02.56
And with that, Mr. Dick Thompson has left the building.

2721
02:47:02.56 --> 02:47:12.88
And once again, it is an honor to be able to sit down with such incredible men.

2722
02:47:12.88 --> 02:47:22.36
And do have the opportunity to hear and to preserve their stories and their lessons.

2723
02:47:22.36 --> 02:47:29.96
And it's actually crazy for me to be sitting here and to have this opportunity.

2724
02:47:29.96 --> 02:47:34.40
And to be able to share it with anybody that wants to hear it.

2725
02:47:34.40 --> 02:47:37.80
They do that wants to learn.

2726
02:47:37.80 --> 02:47:44.68
So I am very thankful for this opportunity.

2727
02:47:44.68 --> 02:47:55.96
And one of the things that allows us to do what we're doing here is you.

2728
02:47:55.96 --> 02:48:02.64
Because by listening, you can take these lessons and apply them to your life and make

2729
02:48:02.64 --> 02:48:05.68
yourself better.

2730
02:48:05.68 --> 02:48:11.44
And if you want to help us while you make yourself better, it seems like it would be a good

2731
02:48:11.44 --> 02:48:12.92
thing to me.

2732
02:48:12.92 --> 02:48:18.92
We could help us help you.

2733
02:48:18.92 --> 02:48:19.92
Do you know what movie that's from?

2734
02:48:19.92 --> 02:48:20.92
Yes, I do.

2735
02:48:20.92 --> 02:48:22.92
What?

2736
02:48:22.92 --> 02:48:24.92
See, you feel like you know.

2737
02:48:24.92 --> 02:48:25.92
No, I guess from.

2738
02:48:25.92 --> 02:48:26.92
I do.

2739
02:48:26.92 --> 02:48:27.92
I just recalled it.

2740
02:48:27.92 --> 02:48:29.92
Jerry Maguire.

2741
02:48:29.92 --> 02:48:30.92
Interesting.

2742
02:48:30.92 --> 02:48:35.92
Doesn't seem like the type movie that you'd watch.

2743
02:48:35.92 --> 02:48:39.92
Yeah, I guess it doesn't really seem like, but maybe it was just a movie that was so popular

2744
02:48:39.92 --> 02:48:40.92
that at some point.

2745
02:48:40.92 --> 02:48:42.92
I watched it.

2746
02:48:42.92 --> 02:48:44.92
Got it on the grid, gotcha.

2747
02:48:44.92 --> 02:48:45.92
Cool.

2748
02:48:45.92 --> 02:48:48.92
Well, help me help you.

2749
02:48:48.92 --> 02:48:49.92
Help you.

2750
02:48:49.92 --> 02:48:50.92
That's how you said it.

2751
02:48:50.92 --> 02:48:51.92
Little bit more dramatic.

2752
02:48:51.92 --> 02:48:53.92
Nonetheless, yes, help yourself.

2753
02:48:53.92 --> 02:48:55.92
That's kind of the real deal, right?

2754
02:48:55.92 --> 02:48:57.92
So what are we doing to help ourselves?

2755
02:48:57.92 --> 02:48:58.92
Do you get to?

2756
02:48:58.92 --> 02:49:01.92
Anti stress activity.

2757
02:49:01.92 --> 02:49:02.92
That's a point.

2758
02:49:02.92 --> 02:49:04.92
Good point.

2759
02:49:04.92 --> 02:49:08.92
Not necessarily changing in the locker, but I was talking to one of my many friends in

2760
02:49:08.92 --> 02:49:09.92
the locker room.

2761
02:49:09.92 --> 02:49:14.92
And when you think about it, Jitu's like the most efficient, a lot of not efficient

2762
02:49:14.92 --> 02:49:20.92
is word, but it's like it's exercise competition, friendly and how should I say, what

2763
02:49:20.92 --> 02:49:26.92
you call, aggressive, aggressive, but like what's like beneficial competition, you know,

2764
02:49:26.92 --> 02:49:27.92
how there's like unhealthy health.

2765
02:49:27.92 --> 02:49:34.92
We'll just say, help you competition exercise, how the competition, so there's social

2766
02:49:34.92 --> 02:49:39.92
element to it.

2767
02:49:39.92 --> 02:49:40.92
These are all things that you get out of it.

2768
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:43.92
Therapy, physical, and mental, by the way.

2769
02:49:43.92 --> 02:49:46.92
And stress relief.

2770
02:49:46.92 --> 02:49:50.92
Which we didn't really hit it on this initial podcast, but

2771
02:49:50.92 --> 02:49:56.92
a doctor, Henry Thompson, also known as Dick Thompson, who we just spent time with.

2772
02:49:56.92 --> 02:49:59.92
His book is called the stress effect and it talks about stress.

2773
02:49:59.92 --> 02:50:05.92
And I concur that Jitu is a stress reliever, you know, big time.

2774
02:50:05.92 --> 02:50:13.92
Yeah, it's kind of like, like you get small levels of stress in Jitu to the point

2775
02:50:13.92 --> 02:50:17.92
where it doesn't feel like stress, but technically it's stress.

2776
02:50:17.92 --> 02:50:25.92
Just like exercise, you know, like the stress, I think that's sort of how it works,

2777
02:50:25.92 --> 02:50:26.92
mentally, physically.

2778
02:50:26.92 --> 02:50:31.92
And a little bit of stress on there, and then boom, there is all of that stress is no stress.

2779
02:50:31.92 --> 02:50:32.92
Yeah.

2780
02:50:32.92 --> 02:50:33.92
Way goes.

2781
02:50:33.92 --> 02:50:35.92
Anyway, when we're doing Jitu, what do we need?

2782
02:50:35.92 --> 02:50:38.92
Geese and rash guards, that's the uniform for lack of a better term.

2783
02:50:38.92 --> 02:50:40.92
What kind of geese we getting?

2784
02:50:40.92 --> 02:50:41.92
100% or 100%.

2785
02:50:41.92 --> 02:50:42.92
100%.

2786
02:50:42.92 --> 02:50:43.92
100%.

2787
02:50:43.92 --> 02:50:47.92
Yeah, making the best geese in the world.

2788
02:50:47.92 --> 02:50:49.92
Yeah, factually made in America.

2789
02:50:49.92 --> 02:50:50.92
In America.

2790
02:50:50.92 --> 02:50:54.92
From American, from American ingredients.

2791
02:50:54.92 --> 02:50:58.92
The masterpiece that is Becky.

2792
02:50:58.92 --> 02:50:59.92
Yeah.

2793
02:50:59.92 --> 02:51:00.92
Yeah.

2794
02:51:00.92 --> 02:51:01.92
Everything else too.

2795
02:51:01.92 --> 02:51:04.92
Also, you know, shirts and jackets and joggers.

2796
02:51:04.92 --> 02:51:05.92
Jeans.

2797
02:51:05.92 --> 02:51:07.92
I saw you in jeans for the first time.

2798
02:51:07.92 --> 02:51:08.92
I think ever.

2799
02:51:08.92 --> 02:51:09.92
When?

2800
02:51:09.92 --> 02:51:10.92
I don't know.

2801
02:51:10.92 --> 02:51:11.92
It was like, we were going somewhere.

2802
02:51:11.92 --> 02:51:13.92
Oh yeah, Washington.

2803
02:51:13.92 --> 02:51:15.92
We were both representing.

2804
02:51:15.92 --> 02:51:16.92
Representing.

2805
02:51:16.92 --> 02:51:17.92
Big time.

2806
02:51:17.92 --> 02:51:18.92
Yeah, I look good.

2807
02:51:18.92 --> 02:51:20.92
I'm not going to.

2808
02:51:20.92 --> 02:51:21.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2809
02:51:21.92 --> 02:51:23.92
I'm not going to ask you your opinion on that matter.

2810
02:51:23.92 --> 02:51:29.92
Well, nonetheless, yes, I was representing big time with my American geese.

2811
02:51:29.92 --> 02:51:30.92
American denim.

2812
02:51:30.92 --> 02:51:32.92
Yeah, from dirt to the shirt.

2813
02:51:32.92 --> 02:51:33.92
As they say.

2814
02:51:33.92 --> 02:51:35.92
On the last jeans, joggers.

2815
02:51:35.92 --> 02:51:36.92
Supplements.

2816
02:51:36.92 --> 02:51:37.92
Don't worry, fair.

2817
02:51:37.92 --> 02:51:38.92
I'm back on discipline.

2818
02:51:38.92 --> 02:51:40.92
That's like two weeks, area day.

2819
02:51:40.92 --> 02:51:41.92
Like.

2820
02:51:41.92 --> 02:51:42.92
No, don't you.

2821
02:51:42.92 --> 02:51:45.92
You know, you sometimes you slip off for whatever reason you run out.

2822
02:51:45.92 --> 02:51:46.92
Whatever.

2823
02:51:46.92 --> 02:51:47.92
Yeah.

2824
02:51:47.92 --> 02:51:48.92
Subscription.

2825
02:51:48.92 --> 02:51:49.92
Yeah, I'm not.

2826
02:51:49.92 --> 02:51:50.92
You can get a subscription.

2827
02:51:50.92 --> 02:51:51.92
Yeah.

2828
02:51:51.92 --> 02:51:52.92
You can get a subscription.

2829
02:51:52.92 --> 02:51:53.92
That way you don't run out.

02:52:04.92 --> 02:52:05.92
Yeah.

2834
02:52:05.92 --> 02:52:07.92
And that way you don't fall off the train.

2835
02:52:07.92 --> 02:52:08.92
Yeah.

2836
02:52:08.92 --> 02:52:10.92
And you save money to cheaper.

2837
02:52:10.92 --> 02:52:11.92
Oh, yeah.

2838
02:52:11.92 --> 02:52:12.92
So this.

2839
02:52:12.92 --> 02:52:16.92
Yeah, and that's like, um, there's certain things in life that are like that.

2840
02:52:16.92 --> 02:52:18.92
Where you like you eat.

2841
02:52:18.92 --> 02:52:21.92
You eat them or use them or whatever like every day.

2842
02:52:21.92 --> 02:52:26.92
And to go on, especially if they save money to go on those little subscription, it's just,

2843
02:52:26.92 --> 02:52:30.92
it's a, that'll improve your efficiency in your life.

02:52:30.92 --> 02:52:32.92
One less than you have to think about.

2845

Oh, yeah.

2846
02:52:33.92 --> 02:52:36.92
And it just comes and you don't have to get that disparaging.

2847
02:52:36.92 --> 02:52:37.92
No, it's just not disparaging.

2848
02:52:37.92 --> 02:52:38.92
It's just to spare.

2849
02:52:38.92 --> 02:52:39.92
Yeah, that disparaging moment.

2850
02:52:39.92 --> 02:52:40.92
Yeah.

2851
02:52:40.92 --> 02:52:42.92
It's going to be three days.

2852
02:52:42.92 --> 02:52:43.92
Yeah.

2853
02:52:43.92 --> 02:52:45.92
Even if I fat exit, they got to get the order.

2854
02:52:45.92 --> 02:52:46.92
Yeah.

2855
02:52:46.92 --> 02:52:47.92
Subscribe.

2856
02:52:47.92 --> 02:52:48.92
Exactly.

2857
02:52:48.92 --> 02:52:49.92
Right.

2858
02:52:49.92 --> 02:52:50.92
So what supplements do it more fair?

2859
02:52:50.92 --> 02:52:51.92
Crill oil.

2860
02:52:51.92 --> 02:52:53.92
These are for your joints and general health.

2861
02:52:53.92 --> 02:52:54.92
Really.

2862
02:52:54.92 --> 02:52:55.92
Curcum in this general health.

2863
02:52:55.92 --> 02:52:56.92
Right there.

2864
02:52:56.92 --> 02:52:57.92
Yeah.

2865
02:52:57.92 --> 02:52:59.92
Also discipline and discipline go finally.

2866
02:52:59.92 --> 02:53:00.92
I got the.

2867
02:53:00.92 --> 02:53:01.92
Jack.

2868
02:53:01.92 --> 02:53:02.92
Doc.

2869
02:53:02.92 --> 02:53:03.92
Doc.

2870
02:53:03.92 --> 02:53:04.92
Doc Savage.

2871
02:53:04.92 --> 02:53:06.92
That's the coach of Myers.

2872
02:53:06.92 --> 02:53:08.92
Signature.

2873
02:53:08.92 --> 02:53:09.92
Signature.

2874
02:53:09.92 --> 02:53:12.92
Signature drink.

2875
02:53:12.92 --> 02:53:13.92
Uh, I like it.

2876
02:53:13.92 --> 02:53:15.92
It's, I haven't done a side by side comparison.

2877
02:53:15.92 --> 02:53:21.92
You know, as far as like which one I prefer, but it, I won't be surprised if that is my favorite one.

2878
02:53:21.92 --> 02:53:22.92
Oh, your new favorite.

2879
02:53:22.92 --> 02:53:23.92
Yes.

2880
02:53:23.92 --> 02:53:24.92
Because your old favorite was.

2881
02:53:24.92 --> 02:53:25.92
Tropical.

2882
02:53:25.92 --> 02:53:26.92
Tropical.

2883
02:53:26.92 --> 02:53:30.92
The lemon lime was kind of too basic to be my favorite.

2884
02:53:30.92 --> 02:53:31.92
It's still fine.

2885
02:53:31.92 --> 02:53:32.92
It's still great.

2886
02:53:32.92 --> 02:53:35.92
That's weird because that basic one that you're over there disparaging.

2887
02:53:35.92 --> 02:53:36.92
No, no, no, no, no.

2888
02:53:36.92 --> 02:53:38.92
Lemon lime is my favorite at this time.

2889
02:53:38.92 --> 02:53:40.92
Well, you're just a simple person.

2890
02:53:40.92 --> 02:53:42.92
You know, I get it in a good way.

2891
02:53:42.92 --> 02:53:44.92
My wife kind of curiously asked me.

2892
02:53:44.92 --> 02:53:47.92
She was like, how many of these can I drink a day?

2893
02:53:47.92 --> 02:53:53.92
Because it turns out my wife is really into the discipline call.

2894
02:53:53.92 --> 02:53:54.92
Yeah.

2895
02:53:54.92 --> 02:53:55.92
So it's a drink.

2896
02:53:55.92 --> 02:53:56.92
Yeah.

2897
02:53:56.92 --> 02:53:59.92
So anyways, I'm thinking four cans is around the limit per day.

2898
02:53:59.92 --> 02:54:00.92
Yeah.

2899
02:54:00.92 --> 02:54:02.92
I've done three and a great.

2900
02:54:02.92 --> 02:54:03.92
Yeah.

2901
02:54:03.92 --> 02:54:07.92
No, you know, hall it because like if you drink even like a coffee scenario where you,

2902
02:54:07.92 --> 02:54:09.92
you get to a point where you drink too many coffees and you're like,

2903
02:54:09.92 --> 02:54:11.92
I don't feel good anymore.

2904
02:54:11.92 --> 02:54:13.92
You feel weird or off or what it fidgety.

2905
02:54:13.92 --> 02:54:15.92
You know, all of these little symptoms.

2906
02:54:15.92 --> 02:54:19.92
You know, I've never actually taken a complete sip of coffee in my whole life.

2907
02:54:19.92 --> 02:54:20.92
No, kidding.

2908
02:54:20.92 --> 02:54:21.92
Yeah.

2909
02:54:21.92 --> 02:54:23.92
I don't like the smell of it.

2910
02:54:23.92 --> 02:54:26.92
Which means I don't like I don't even have people go whatever you ever tasted it.

2911
02:54:26.92 --> 02:54:31.92
I'm like, well, I suppose at some point I'm guessing I put a little sip into my mouth.

2912
02:54:31.92 --> 02:54:33.92
But even the smell alone, I smell them.

2913
02:54:33.92 --> 02:54:34.92
I was like, I don't like this.

2914
02:54:34.92 --> 02:54:37.92
Yeah, what about coffee like flavors don't like it.

2915
02:54:37.92 --> 02:54:38.92
Don't like it.

2916
02:54:38.92 --> 02:54:39.92
Don't like coffee ice cream.

2917
02:54:39.92 --> 02:54:40.92
But I don't eat it though.

2918
02:54:40.92 --> 02:54:41.92
Yes.

2919
02:54:41.92 --> 02:54:44.92
And then, you know, sometimes there'll be some kind of special treat.

2920
02:54:44.92 --> 02:54:49.92
So like some kind of a, I wait, does tiramisu, you know what tiramisu is?

2921
02:54:49.92 --> 02:54:51.92
Doesn't that have some coffee flavor in it?

2922
02:54:51.92 --> 02:54:52.92
I don't know.

2923
02:54:52.92 --> 02:54:53.92
Okay.

2924
02:54:53.92 --> 02:54:54.92
Well, it seems to be.

2925
02:54:54.92 --> 02:54:55.92
But in all of it.

2926
02:54:55.92 --> 02:54:57.92
No, no, no, that's the only one.

2927
02:54:57.92 --> 02:54:58.92
tiramisu.

2928
02:54:58.92 --> 02:54:59.92
Yeah.

2929
02:54:59.92 --> 02:55:03.92
That's one dessert that's, it sort of like takes some skill to make.

2930
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.92
And if it's on the menu at a really nice restaurant, sometimes I'll have a little

2931
02:55:08.92 --> 02:55:12.92
bit of an instant area.

2932
02:55:12.92 --> 02:55:15.92
I get my tiramisu like partially.

2933
02:55:15.92 --> 02:55:18.92
And this is sort of rationalization partially.

2934
02:55:18.92 --> 02:55:21.92
Because, well, what I tell myself was like, well, you know, I kind of need to see what it tastes like.

2935
02:55:21.92 --> 02:55:23.92
Because there's, there's some tiramisu.

2936
02:55:23.92 --> 02:55:26.92
One of the best things I've ever tasted in my life was tiramisu.

2937
02:55:26.92 --> 02:55:30.92
There was a candidate at this little Jeremy Stevens just got done cutting weight.

2938
02:55:30.92 --> 02:55:34.92
We went to, yeah, we weighed in and we went to this Italian place.

2939
02:55:34.92 --> 02:55:36.92
Homemade, Italian place.

2940
02:55:36.92 --> 02:55:42.64
food it was just I was sick how much food we ate and then he goes I'm making

2941
02:55:42.64 --> 02:55:45.96
you my termister and I said down on him I guess I'm making it for you you know

2942
02:55:45.96 --> 02:55:50.94
I'm just gonna do it you just be quiet so it took like 40 minutes you like

2943
02:55:50.94 --> 02:55:56.60
made it he brings out you know you know once you've eaten a lot you still

2944
02:55:56.60 --> 02:55:59.84
think you can eat more but then after like 15 minutes you're like no I can't

2945
02:55:59.84 --> 02:56:04.24
yeah so we was like 40 minutes so now I'm just thinking myself I cannot

2946
02:56:04.24 --> 02:56:07.88
eat anymore yeah he brings out this termister and he's like hmm and yeah I

2947
02:56:07.88 --> 02:56:10.48
forget what kind of accent he had but he had an accent it was either French or

2948
02:56:10.48 --> 02:56:14.88
Italian I think it was French but you know he just put it in front of me and I

2949
02:56:14.88 --> 02:56:20.04
I took a bite and it was the it was definitely one of the best things I've ever

2950
02:56:20.04 --> 02:56:24.08
had dang that's saying a lot because it's one thing if like you're hungry in the

2951
02:56:24.08 --> 02:56:27.48
first of me had it all you know kind of has an impression and imprinted in your brain

2952
02:56:27.48 --> 02:56:32.28
but you're like basically the worst conditions to have that experience be so

2953
02:56:32.28 --> 02:56:37.08
good oh yeah thank because everything else was good too so anyways maybe and it

2954
02:56:37.08 --> 02:56:41.72
made me need to make a tear-missue mole if that's if that's even a thing but

2955
02:56:41.72 --> 02:56:45.20
wait what is it is there a tear-missue like a flavor I don't know if I got to

2956
02:56:45.20 --> 02:56:50.16
do research I know I got to do research see no what that means got to eat

2957
02:56:50.16 --> 02:56:55.76
some art there I was there yeah so speaking of milk you can get milk that's

2958
02:56:55.76 --> 02:57:00.20
protein it's another dessert which is as good as tear-missue it's as good as

2959
02:57:00.20 --> 02:57:05.52
94% of tear-missue because there's only 6% of tear-missue that are mind-blowing

2960
02:57:05.52 --> 02:57:10.000
the rest of them you know they're okay is it because of the coffee I have no idea

2961
02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.28
I don't know I'm at any idea what's in tear-missue I don't know what it is but it

2962
02:57:13.28 --> 02:57:20.000
tastes good in 6% situations mole 100% taste good how's this last night speaking

2963
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.76
of milk I ran out of milk so do I just be a savage in put water in it because

2964
02:57:25.76 --> 02:57:29.60
it wasn't that serious keep in mind and this literally true had I was eating

2965
02:57:29.60 --> 02:57:35.92
steak rice broccoli and that was sort of it yeah whatever yeah I need a little

2966
02:57:35.92 --> 02:57:40.68
something right so figureless but the thing when you eat steak rice broccoli

2967
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:44.84
you don't need additional protein necessarily unless the steak is small I

2968
02:57:44.84 --> 02:57:49.32
get it but at that moment you know does really need it I just wanted it but I'm

2969
02:57:49.32 --> 02:57:53.88
out of milk so you see my conundrum right is it kind of don't worth it kind of

2970
02:57:53.88 --> 02:57:59.68
situation but I found some you know the one in the can evaporated milk you

2971
02:57:59.68 --> 02:58:02.64
know that thing you ever tasted that before yeah yeah yeah right doesn't taste

2972
02:58:02.64 --> 02:58:08.52
good yeah taste pretty whack actually but put it in the milk it makes it like

2973
02:58:08.52 --> 02:58:14.40
more creamy oh it was good it was surprisingly good yes so it was like a it was

2974
02:58:14.40 --> 02:58:18.60
like the same deal the dessert little bit extra creamy I put some peanut butter

2975
02:58:18.60 --> 02:58:23.76
and it to give the dark chocolate one so yes milk you are correct 100% be

2976
02:58:23.76 --> 02:58:27.08
little so I'm gonna be little the other day and I said you know I've only

2977
02:58:27.08 --> 02:58:33.48
actually had the darkness milk a couple times you have yes and he said you

2978
02:58:33.48 --> 02:58:38.12
gotta try it again it's really good and so I went home and I was like okay I'm

2979
02:58:38.12 --> 02:58:42.42
gonna have I'm gonna have the dark darkness it's good oh yeah it's a

2980
02:58:42.42 --> 02:58:47.62
much of my main jam right now oh really darkness you yeah so all I've kind of

2981
02:58:47.62 --> 02:58:53.06
disparaged that flavor a bit of you know I've been like well you know

2982
02:58:53.06 --> 02:58:57.26
everything else is so great and then they're chocolate the darkness now I'm

2983
02:58:57.26 --> 02:59:03.30
sort of thinking I underestimated the quality and the taste of the darkness

2984
02:59:03.30 --> 02:59:08.78
okay so you get milk you can also get strawberry milk and chocolate milk for

2985
02:59:08.78 --> 02:59:13.42
your kids warrior kid milk so that they're healthy for the strawberry one I'm

2986
02:59:13.42 --> 02:59:18.98
not saying do this but do this just try it how about this just try it add a half

2987
02:59:18.98 --> 02:59:23.30
of banana in it just do that my report back did I tell you my daughter the other day

2988
02:59:23.30 --> 02:59:30.74
she sent me she's in college and she sent me a snapchat yeah sure yeah you're

2989
02:59:30.74 --> 02:59:35.70
on snapchat oh good yeah well yeah that's that's closed scenario with the

2990
02:59:35.70 --> 02:59:43.26
fan oh close circle I got you and anyways cuz she's a 18 year old girl she sent me a

2991
02:59:43.26 --> 02:59:51.82
snap of her yeah of her shake and it said it said you could you could just

2992
02:59:51.82 --> 02:59:56.42
know exactly what it said it said literally a peanut butter chocolate milk shake

2993
02:59:56.42 --> 03:00:03.78
that was the the text and then she called me because I don't really check

2994
03:00:03.78 --> 03:00:09.02
snap that often of course I don't think I've got it live for notifications but

2995
03:00:09.02 --> 03:00:14.38
then she said you know she sent me a text check your snap and I said why what is

2996
03:00:14.38 --> 03:00:19.58
everything okay you know it's like I literally just made the best it's literally

2997
03:00:19.58 --> 03:00:27.50
so anyway I think it's complete hilarity not 99% 100% hilarity how

2998
03:00:27.50 --> 03:00:33.38
witnessing second hand by the way you navigate your way through the current

2999
03:00:33.38 --> 03:00:42.86
trends of 18 year old snapchat lingo scenarios it's very funny yeah and I'm sure

3000
03:00:42.86 --> 03:00:49.46
I'm not the only one yeah also jocquwaiti yes not forget about the jocquwaiti

3001
03:00:49.46 --> 03:00:53.66
you know once you kind of deadlift all that way to whatever we tend to forget

3002
03:00:53.66 --> 03:00:57.10
where you know how you got there so let's just not forget that and plus

3003
03:00:57.10 --> 03:01:04.10
winter is here kind of sure yeah follows but what that means is warm drinks

3009
03:01:33.86 --> 03:01:37.78

03:01:37.78 --> 03:01:42.22
people were too oh my gosh amazing but you're not amazed by this just say good

3011
