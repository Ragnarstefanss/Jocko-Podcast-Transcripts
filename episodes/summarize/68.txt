I mean, that's why my kid's wrestle, you know, it's because I didn't wrestle, and I hate that fact, because I go against, like he's saying, you know, I go against a good high school wrestler, I it's hard for me to take him to the ground, you know, you get somebody that wrestled in college, I know what's, I know I'm not good. so something's like anything else is like you're you're probably gonna take the ones that you feel like you need or you want help with you know like if you're like That sounds like, you know, maybe someone who's fully blaming themselves and then like, instead of taking action to, you know, implement corrective measures, something like this they're like, I suck and I don't mean diet like I'm just saying eating correctly and not incorrectly if you're about to slip on that you get enticed like my sister explained she did with her son brings home some brownies she couldn't help but eat the brownies now she's paying for it on the treadmill according to her words not like at the moment of the introduction of the brownies or donuts as the case maybe you put on one of these tracks it's called sugar coated lies snack time she's got a coated lies listen to jockel he'll explain to you some stuff that will cause you to not slip on that plan and this goes for like I said waking up doing the workout pushing yourself during the workout all this stuff getting your work to all this stuff yep we do those long range leadership alignment programs yes that is what we do so me life jpg day of work combat leadership applied to business and life check the website echelon front dot com or email info at echelon front dot com also the master and again this is not a seminar about getting pumped up no it isn't a seminar about finding yourself it's not going to help you channel your internal cheat towards eternal bliss it's not going to do that it's not what the musters about the muster is about leadership pragmatic leadership skills for you to use in your business and your life you work with people you lead people or you aspire to lead people who's going to teach you how to do that where you're going to learn that from actual question where do you learn that from who's going to teach it to you learn to lead your people learn to lead yourself may fourth and fifth New York City so yes I'm like I'm not expecting that I mean that just has to do with naps but this the new mood one that's for like if you have like stress you know but don't talk about it if we don't know then talk about another thing so you understand now if you're if you know what happens to sodium metal when you put in water that's gonna be used that's the amazon click i'm just saying i think it's important to like remember that because it's that's really you do think it's important so that's don't let's don't let's don't mind this every time subscribe to the podcast i didn't stitch our google play all the podcast platforms and right of you review if you're in the mood that's a good right of you so put the rankings if our podcast is in good ranking that's cool You know, so if I play the wrestling game, and I know I know wrestling, like I'm solid, I can wrestle against good wrestlers, maybe not Taylor, but good wrestlers. so I was like should I need more meat in there looking at the fridge like nothing so I got a little bit of your bar too worried where it's in chopped them up and like put it in there and like he just helped it in the microwave it's actually good then and I said I like being angry I don't think I'll try your your potion which is also kind of strange even that I mean I know you don't actually like being angry you're also not angry all the time that's true I don't think I've seen you angry You know, I mean any physical move is helpful to know and not a defend whether it be from offensive, or defense position, but again, if you're trying to narrow it down and teach these guys who their approach and their knowledge comes from the vastness of grappling, and you want to narrow it down to this thing, it may or may not work, you know, and it may or may not serve you, it could work against you, but here, let's try to learn this, real hard, You know, like, you know how certain people they're like, oh, this guy's accent is too thick. You know, they say like, if you get like emotions, you've got to like let it out, punch a pillow or whatever. no I bought it for my wife because she you know how like she's the kind where she like if there's a task like let's do the task real task Unless you're doing it like seven days a week for, you know, a few weeks then you can start to feel like, hey, or your nutrition is bad or I don't know something. okay we're putting it on there will be the judge of that over here on this end also jocos a store if you don't know it's called jocosstore dot com if you uh you know if you like these shirts that we make and we put effort into the shirts they're not like the cheap make a stencil spray paint cheap hands not that hands is cheap but cheap shirt here I'm probably either sleep in her close to sleep you know not everyone's like that where there'll be like all the stuff was on my mind because I go into taking an app and I'm like BTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTF can't sleep car do some antioxidant that you're the first lady you know when you get the krill oil take care of your joints you'd be surprised the role they play and everything that's my opinion if you're not on that get on that also good way to support amazon click through what you do is you go be free to your amazon shopping if you don't already be for you do your amazon shopping go through the website jocopadcast.com or jocostory which are click on the amazon link also it's also called support click on support well amazon link whatever then you so you click through the website then you go do your amazon shopping outstanding way to support really good support then you do shopping as you normally would in boom instant support and you know it doesn't cost you anything cost you two seconds of your time for big support Grammar Nazis like me and you are telling you about, you know, you get through something or beat the beach and you're like, you know, I correct you. i guess so i think so or subscribe to or and subscribe to youtube if you're into youtube you watch videos you can see this podcast obviously in video format or all the excerpts that we put on there you said that like there's this massive there is so there is and there's more coming and you know those these are good because you can share them with your friend you know And so boom, now I got to do a study of the flashcard for that last 25% to lock in the knowledge where when I go in to take the test, I know 100% I know, I'm going to know every answer on the question. But you do, too, like I said, it's just so unless you're being that guy, that parent, you know the one who's like you're going no matter what. Marya grand marquee are we playing around no we are not the first master was awesome why are we having a second muster because the first muster was awesome that's why we're having a second muster so come to it and until we see you at the muster because by the way I'm going to be there life's going to be there jp's going to be there Dave Burke going to be there that's not enough for you and you need something to kind of close the deal no worry because echo Charles is going to be there probably giving you four hour speech to the public And so the fact that you can pull guard gives you this entire out to get away from doing take downs, and you can still be victorious, and that goes along with these techniques that he mentioned, like, you know, through, see hip, basically there's, there's a lot of moves in there, there are big moves, big moves, and they do help you, but like I said, they're just, they're simply not necessary. so they're not that kind they're good they got some you know cool these are if you like them so check out those go there jocosstore dot com if you want to support in that way get a shirt and represent in the wild boom women stuff whatever shirts patches rash guards 19% performance increase proven 147% proven 19% improvement who do you say as well it's getting warmer i understand but still it's cold someplace I mean, I just don't have the time and the motivation to do it, because I'm in the same boat as, you know, the guy that you're just talking about, how much time am I going to focus on take downs, I know I go against a college wrestler, he's taking me down. But they understand, they realize, you know, and for, you know, for my, for my young daughter that was, you know, five years old at the time, I said, I said, this is how we get food and this is how you get toys. but like why do you think you know I should do that this will you know you won't be so angry all the time Because it's almost like you're doing like you're going through that war or that particular ambush or something like that. but I didn't feel like I was in a new mood but from the people that other people that take it because you know like it was good though even you're used to worry about kind of like beef jerky or like it was it like soft and moist it was no I actually, it's kind of like what you're talking earlier about surfing without a leash or about, you know, parachuting under a pressure situation where I don't know what the hell Yeah, and it seems like, like to, because he was originally not complaining about complaining, but he, his premise was that, you know, jiu-jitsu is not in fact the hardest one to mask. on it's the best supplements let's get that out of the way like straight up factually brother also they have like you know where your butt proud the other day Just don't Ziggy the exit, meaning don't don't have a bad exit, which like at this point, like I said, I was probably batting 50% bad exits because I just didn't know what I was doing. If you didn't know that, you know, you're like, for rats who cares kind of thing. i just manipulate the thing to the little bookmark place where he can start but if you don't you don't want to do all that you can just find the excerpt that i put on the youtube channel you know they're just more shareable so they don't have a listen to the whole podcast to get the you know the it's a specific lesson that's really cool you'd think that there would be a lot of those from your excitement about them We didn't know that there was defenses that we hadn't been told about to the south and why that's why we should come into the north or we didn't know that the sun would be at our back from the north and that's why we didn't know that at the time. but what seems like the couch nap year in this mental state that is kind of like you have low expectations comfort you know There's no jiu-jitsu guy in the gym that goes to the first tournament and says, yeah, that was just like what I thought it was going to be like, no, they're not used to that intensity. But once he, if he can give up the wrestling rules, you know, you know, he, he, he, because he has that athleticism, he switches hips, like all quick. And you know, he's like in Jocco kind of like laughed at me. Some people in your case, apparently, you feel that in surfing with the leash, but I think some people that at the same time, it's like wearing a mouthpiece too, you know?
