This is a question I get asked all the time, everybody wants them to know who to hire and what I look for and obviously I look for someone that's humble and I look for someone that's balanced and really, you know, it's one of those things where as much as you can before you hire someone get to know them and the advice we give people the national on front all the time when they're looking to hire someone is we say, look, if you can hire them temporarily, bring them on as a contractor for 90 days, you have to see them in the environment that they're actually going into, they're going to be working in before you know what they're really going to be like because just like going through, they screen people like crazy to go into seal training and they can't tell who's going to make it and who's not going to make it. and then you have to tell yourself that you're not going to quit no matter what happens no matter what happens you're not going to quit no matter what happens because they're going to play a little psychological games on you like like let's say they go all he's in good shape he's you know we can't really touch him physically he's in really good shape so now you know what they're going to do they're going to say oh you know you failed this academic test you're not smart you're not really smart enough yeah so take it easy and all that being said I do have strategic conversations with my wife about the family team right like we're a business like your your house and your family is a business you have income you have expenditures you have long-term strategic goals so those kind of things we talk about and you know I'm the one that's sort of is usually saying hey what about this strategic goal what are you doing over here what do you want to do that so we have those conversations but not so much me saying how but me you know us figuring out what we're going together life this she ever like teach you how to be strategic in any way like be more sensitive or anything like that bro you serious and so I've had to have this conversation over and over again and what we're going to do is number one we're not going to act like we know everything even if you do know more even if you have things more figured out than these guys if you go in there and act like it guess what they're going to do they're going to reject you who is this young whipper snapper young buck thinks he knows everything he doesn't know about this he doesn't know about that they'll sabotage you to make you look bad but if you go in there in your humble I'm not talking about being a pushover I'm not talking about being weak we're looking I want to have some time to hang out sign books we got to be out here by 11 so we're getting close go ahead man front row Jacko thank you for speaking tonight just a quick question I've I work in a corporation here in New York and one of the toughest things with being an analyst here is just the fact of like when you actually escalate or you know which which kind of feels like defeat but also at the same time you want to make sure you live in somebody else to know what's going on so just want to ask you about that thank you for me I look at a problem if I think I can contain the problem then I'm going to try and contain the problem I recognize so if echo if echo is working for me I show up he's more experienced than me and I show up and I say all right here's what we're doing here's how we're doing this mission here's how it's going to be my way and I think he knows what's up now he knows he's on the boss what's he actually thinking who's this idiot that's had the job for three days and he thinks he's going to tell me what to do and he's going to he's going to resist it he's going to sabotage he's going to and we're going to have a bad relationship but if I come in and say hey echo really great to meet you you know I'm just checking in here I was looking at your that's a person that I can emulate that was when I got to the seal teams up to that point I was looking I was a confused kid that was looking at this you know this person and that person but I didn't really but even though even I wasn't confused enough to be like all I'm going to be like that person and follow what they're doing I would look at people like that seems pretty cool that seems pretty cool and so it wasn't till I got into the seal teams and there were some people that you instantly when I checked into the seal team one I'm like that guy's awesome so what would I do in this situation first of all I am going to be awesome at the paperwork I'm gonna do it so well that because if you blow off the paperwork then you go to your boss and say the paperwork sucks and it's not any good the guy looks at you and says oh you know what you don't even not to do the paperwork how do you know how do you know if it's harder or not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do I'm going to start building a case that's what I'm going to do it's everyone's got their awesome special operations units and the training is all hard and all for when I heard the seals the toughest training is okay that's what I want to do what do you do to get ready for you know what you got to do to get ready for you know army guess what you're going to be humpin' a rock you're going to be doing force marches you got to be over the run you got to build a nav you got to be able to do push ups and pull ups and and dips and rope crimes and offscores that's what you got to do you got to train hard you got to train as hard as you possibly can but I'm going to lean towards being humble I'm going to lean towards listening to what they have to say I'm going to lean towards saying hey you know I've never handled a case like this before you have any perspective you can help me out with this instead of hey this case is mine let me show you how it's going to be that right there you're taking a relationship in a negative direction we want to we want to we want to build a team well we're going to do missions we don't know how bad it's going to be it might be bad it might not be that's sort of was the standard those guys that were coming into a body that relieved us from body they knew and the senior enlisted guys are one of my very good friends those guys knew 100 percent they went to Mike Montsource and then got on a plane and came over they knew 100 percent and so for me I won't forget looking at this group of guys that were about to start a six month appointment and telling them you are going to take casualties and that was just a blunt honest truth and they did take casualties they didn't lose anyone they had no one killed but they took some very very severe casualties and did a great job a great group of guys but that was a harsh reality to walk into for sure Roger I would do one more of these questions before the life questions will go live people what was your first combat mission and what was your role so 2003 I deployed to Baghdad as a seal-potent commander and the senior enlisted guy of my task unit was already in Baghdad waiting for us and this guy is an incredible guy just as a matter of fact his wife tells him and me that we're soulmates she jealous awesome thank you all by you question over here you he's leaving it I like to come prepared good evening jockel good evening what lesson do you wish you'd have learned earlier in life that you now know it is disciplinical freedom I mean that is the thing that that when I connected that together in my head that that the fact that that applies to absolutely everything that's the biggest lesson that I wish I would have learned earlier in life and if I would have figured that out then I would have been doing a lot better and I would have done a lot better and I would have been a lot better of a person the thing that I try to tell kids I try to tell them that for sure the other thing that I think kids miss is kids and I miss is something that I completely missed as a kid the actions that you take now affect your future that sounds so obvious but when you're 14 you just think no nothing I you know my life is only another 20 minutes yep we heard from Jocco you know he put out the word he didn't say much doesn't even seem like he has to we we hear we's coming from so you just have to build a team that's going to compliment your weaknesses and you know generally if you're introverted well that means you're good at some other thing that that loudmouth isn't good at right the loudmouth is like who's going the front door kick it down and he doesn't have any sort of tactical sense of how to run an operation smoothly so you come up with a good plan and then you brief it's a bill loudmouth bill and you can definitely put them in guide them in the right direction but what you don't want to do is make every decision for them what you don't want to do is only let them do what you tell them to do they've got to learn to make decisions otherwise they can't go into the world and defend for themselves they've got a suffer consequences of their bad decisions otherwise they can't defend for themselves in the world so you have to set this before you have to you have to like let them brush up against the guardrails of failure you have to let them tie their on you you have to let them spill the milk and the more you make or allow them to do for themselves the better human beings they're going to be the more that you do for them and force on them and impose on them the less they're going to know for themselves and the more they're going to rebel against the values that you're putting forth to them again it's a dichotomy let me tell you what's going to happen in 18 months if we keep paying that we're not going to have a company anymore here's the numbers here's how it's going to work and they lower down their hourly rate to $55 now that's a huge cut and you can imagine the union thinking that's we lost we lost but Mulalee did a great job of saying no we lose if we don't come together we lose if we don't try and achieve our actual mission the mission that we're all focused on which is making great cars and being a profitable company so same thing here make sure that the areas that overlap the common mission make sure that everyone understands how achieving the common mission benefits both parties to access I've been a police officer if you have some long questions for echo Charles I mean I'm trying he's been studying him for four hours I've been a police officer for about four years I consider myself to be proactive and try to get after it every day much like many of my brother and sister law enforcement officers recently I switched to a bigger agency with a bit of a different mission I still try to be as proactive and as thorough as I can in everything that I do and we'll try it again you know what you're gonna run the same mission tomorrow night I know you can do this that's how you build that trust up that's how you build a team hand came up quick right there it's amazing that you can tell the one pointing out jaco echo thank you for everything that he's given us acknowledging that we all have secrets jaco what would you need to see happen that would change your mind about a run at public office what let me finish what would be that sugar event to make you say okay public office stand by to get some I'll finish when sake white frankly you have a nation of troopers both foreign and domestic that believe and know that you're qualified to lead and ready to lend their support um what would it take there is a line somewhere there is a line somewhere where where I would feel like and they're moving forward in something that's going to really be detrimental to the organization we got to start trying to figure out how to flank that person and and building a a alliances with people that can try and get us going in the right way thank you and of course there's you know there's situations where you know especially in the business environment like if you're in a ship and the ship is sinking and you've sounded the alarm and you've tried to you've tried to plug the holes and you've told everyone yeah makes sense to any kind of got to tell the truth to yourself because you know like you could answer the email later or add another time not dinner time or whatever you know you can a got to be truthful that's what I found anyway helps that's why you don't return my emails on time next question was there time during your service in the teams that stood out above the rest and would you mind sharing a brief story not before heard on your podcast well obviously the time in the teams was being in task in a bruiser being in the battle or moddy that's pretty straightforward something that I haven't I don't think I've talked about on the podcast Thank you can I add one more thing to to that which actually jockel opened my eyes to this and it like like your kids are always watching you like always what so if you're yelling at mom or yelling that people on the phone or I don't know doing stuff you're doing stuff that you don't want them to do you can say hey don't do this they'll be like cool and then when things are kind of calm I'm like what do I do now like how am I going to you know even when you were just saying like your last line sometimes I think like you just speak to me and I'm talking spouses how many people are just super open to being taught like if I was like let me teach you a little something you're in mean like that's that already starts off in a bad footing because it implies that I know something you don't know I can help you you're inferior to me you lack the spring knowledge that I have clearly I must instruct you that's key to quiz right and they already want to see me fail before I even got to the position so I'm trying to mentally prepare myself in that role when I already know that it's coming against me so what's your best advice for someone that is going to be you know in this position of see I was looking every position as a leadership position but now structurally I'm going to be their supervisor so what's your best advice to to me going into that situation I'm going to do my best to mitigate it and while I'm doing that I'm going to try and inform the other people around that person of the situation that's going on I'm going to build relationships with the CEO with the CEO with the CEO with the CEO you're talking about or if it's the batissio whoever it is I'm going to build some relationships with other people so we can get that person under control the other thing we have to remember is sometimes at the bottom we don't understand what the real strategy is I'm going to live my days how did you get from that transition from you know possibly I don't know if I'm going to come out of this battle I don't know if I'm going to come home to hey look I know this is painful right now everyone in this squad everyone in this platoon is gonna do all this we're gonna log down what it takes because I am gonna bring a solid case up the chain of command of where we need to limit this paperwork this is a long war situation you know I'm gonna took to build up all that paperwork it took years it took 20 years 30 years for that to happen are you suggest you'll come out the number the Navy in the seal teams the range are range procedures are super loose we go out there I really like when things are going bad and so in the government things don't get that bad and for me to put my time and effort towards something all that you know it's really focused I would get bored very quickly because you know to be like but he ended up he ended up killing himself and you know it was drugs and it was alcohol and it was just bad but while I was going through buds he killed himself and what I tried to explain to the kids on the Warrior Kid podcast is like the decisions that the little decisions that you make they matter they add up and you have to connect those dots otherwise you don't know where you're going to end up and it might be bad okay you're also going to compete because competing makes you better and it gets worse because then it was oh when I take you to compete since I'm the coach I'm going to put you in a higher weight class I'm going to put you against older kids and you know what if you lose look if you lose it doesn't matter because you're going to be tougher that eight week probationary jacco period who are some of the well-known leaders today who you believe best exemplify extreme ownership be it in politics military or business military you know obviously I like like like matters a lot not effect I like matters
