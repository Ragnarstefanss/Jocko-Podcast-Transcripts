00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 258, with me, Jocco willing.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Several AK-47's open fire before the King Bees wheels touch down.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Nonetheless, black in the remaining 3-Vitanamese ST Alabama team members exited the H-34.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As the King be lifted off, the NVA gunfire increased significantly, and moments later, the laboring Sikorski H-34 crashed.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Although this was black's first song mission into Prairie Fire, he knew the odds were stacked against ST Alabama.

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He and Cowboy argued vigorously for an immediate extraction.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The team had been compromised. The element of surprise was gone.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The other American who had not gone through special forces qualification course at Fort Bragg remained silent.

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
No, said the new one-zero, I'm an American, no slant-eyed son of a bitch is going to run me off.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Watkins offered the one-zero a chance to extract. The offer was declined. The team was to continue.

11
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The team leader ordered the point man to walk down a well-traveled trail away from the LZ into the jungle.

12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Black, Cowboy, and the point man Hoa argued against heading down the trail. The first rule of recon was to never use trails, especially well-traveled ones.

13
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The one-zero pulled rank and ordered the team to move down the trail with Hoa leading the way and the elder Green Bore following a short distance behind him.

14
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The trail wound into the jungle and curved to the left. ST Alabama moved consciously. As the team went down the trail, it moved parallel to a small rise on its right.

15
00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That was about 10 to 20 feet above the team. On at the NVA kernel, had quickly assembled a force of 50 NVA soldiers who set up a classic L-shaped ambush.

16
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The quiet of the early morning jungle was shattered when the NVA troops opened fire with their AK-47s and SKS rifles. The AK rounds ripped into the point man's chest and face.

17
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The fatal impact of those rounds lifted the canteen covers around his waist, appearing to keep his body suspended in air.

18
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What had been a human body milliseconds earlier was being chewed into a morphous form that hit the ground with a sickening thud.

19
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Our tierial blood spurred at high end of the air. Three rounds slammed into the one-zero's head, blowing off the right side of his face, killing him instantly. Nothing could prepare ST Alabama for the grizzly horror unfolding at that moment. The one-one buried his face in the dirt and started praying.

20
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Black and the remaining ST Alabama team members returned fire. The green berets stood there firing us on single shot. Picking off NVA soldiers on top of the rise. He loaded his car 15 and went down the line shooting them one after another.

21
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Sometimes they spun and he shot them a second or third time. As the NVA continued to fire on the team, black and cowboy formed the team into a circle and directed a barrage of M79 grenade rounds and car 15 fire into the surrounding jungle.

22
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Then, startling eerie silence. Black thought he was in his grave. ST Alabama was in a low spot with the ground rising 10 to 20 feet on both left and right.

23
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Both the NVA and ST Alabama tended to their wounded while the living combatants slammed loaded magazines into their hot weapons.

24
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There was moaning and groaning, human suffering on both sides. Black got on the PRC 25 to tell Kovie about ST Alabama's tragic turn of events. Black and though scabbard,

25
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the weapons and ammo from the dead ST Alabama team members. Fortunately, Kovie was still airborne. Black reported that he had two KIAs and two WIAs and was surrounded by NVA troops.

26
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Kovie responded, you're not a doctor. Nor for that fact, a medic. You can't determine who's dead or alive. Bring out all bodies for verification of death.

27
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Then, more than 100 NVA regulars open fire on ST Alabama as enemy troops at reinforced the initial ambush unit. By now, the NVA were too low's deep. The front row fired AK-47s.

28
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The second row through grenades or fired RPGs.

29
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now, that is a story from the book across the fence by John Straggermire, also known as tilt.

30
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It's a story of October 5th, 1968, a special forces sob mission over the border in the Louss.

31
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The story is also covered in the book Whiskey Tango Fox Drop, which is by Lynn Black, called Name Black, Jack.

32
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And for a variety of reasons, Lynn was not able to join us on the show, but through tilt and his friends and the special operations community.

33
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We are absolutely honored to have with us tonight, con cowboy don't, Vietnamese soldier that fought for freedom alongside American special forces soldiers from Sog.

34
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Con, thank you for joining us. It's an honor to have you here.

35
00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:06.000
My pleasure. And also joining us once again is John Straggermire, the man himself, tilt, a special forces soldier and member of Sog, who has been on the podcast before 180, 181, 182, 186, 247 and 248.

36
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Good to be back sir. Good to be here with cowboy. Thank you. Con, it's awesome to have you here. And so your nickname is cowboy. How do we get the nickname cowboy?

37

38
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's a good name. We always call it that in camp. Nobody called it colonel. It's like, hey cowboy, we knew cowboy was.

39
00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You can, yeah, a little bit difficult to pronounce, yes and know by American. So it is easy on, you know, like the, for friendly say, hey cowboy at all the time, even my commanding official.

40
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Make it snow. Right. Cool. When we got information every single morning call me cowboy. Everybody going, no who, who I was. And well, that's awesome. Before you came cowboy, what let's go back to your, you know, where you're from, where you grew up, what that, what that was like, a lot of, a lot of Americans, we don't know what that's like growing up in Vietnam.

41
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So what year were you born? I was born from North Vietnam. The Nin Bane, provided. And then I watched, very young. I don't know anything.

42
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But 1954, my family moved to the south in order, the communist took over North Vietnam. We immigrated to the south and we live in in Sagan for two years. My family moved up to the last city. You know, the, the, the, the, the, I sent them. They're very nice city, beautiful.

43
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Beautiful, beautiful and the the weather it like it the just normal. And you can see the, you can see the lot like the young lady.

44
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So you like it. We live in there. What was it like when before you left, what was it like when the communist came and took over. Yeah, what the, what was that like for your family. What did it, what did they do? What did that seem like what happened.

45
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I don't know because I was young, but understand up to that that a communist wanted to kill everybody and they want to collect, you know, property from their citizen to be, you know, like at the communist party.

46
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And that's why my family moved from North to the south. What was your father's job? What did he do?

47
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Actually, I still, now I still don't understand what he did. He only the Bayesian at man. But he was in the business of business vision of man. Yes. And he moved now to the south. He vision that, but inside, you, you know, the back rise.

48
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And he was in there, but I don't know who he was. Okay. And sometimes he, he'd be the taxi driver and motorcycle driver to take care of the people, but understand now understand like he's quite.

49
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And the, under, under the cover, any way, anytime. And 19th century tree, president, not in Jim, you know him.

50
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:51.000
He was a passenger before Kennedy before Kennedy. Yes. And I, I, I strong believe that he worked with him. And after revolution, revolution from the, from the, yeah, Vietnamese army.

51
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They put my father in jail because he worked for the old government. He worked for the president Jim. That time I, what, like it.

52
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I, I, I do not understand it. But when I visited him, the time he was in jail, I learned something. I learned something about him.

53
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I'm thinking about, you know, what I'm trying to do to pay back the people, you know, did to my father.

54
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:57.000
He, in jail, but he very smart man. He told me, a American gunna go to Vietnam. When I, what, Jiang, I study French.

55
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And then when he in jail, he say, hey, I better learn English because he understand the American gunna come to Vietnam. And study, I, I'm studying English at the time.

56
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But, like it for me, it, my family very close to, you know, the use it. I mean, Vietnamese American Association. So I studied from them.

57
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And then my father still in jail. And my father, you know, they're going to make it going down a lot. So I tried to survive by myself and for my family.

58
00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And I'm very lucky when I studied English, my teacher. He's American. He understand my situation and my family. And he, at five years, to join to the army.

59
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And I, but I, I don't know about him too, but he for a nice guy. Me, me, you don't know what his actual job was.

60
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
He only teaches just the teacher. You're the teacher. But I thought in my, my, he was, he knew extra work for the government sometime.

61
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Yeah, yeah, he saw me. Yes. He got to go, you know, to pick up the who's the bad guy or who's the good guy.

62
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Because in the class, he, all the, all the time, where, where your family, what he, what, what has been, you know, our situation, my family.

63
00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But the money, I'm, you know, how do we survival? He, he learned from us a lot from the student. And I believe, you know, up to that he pick up the student to become, you know, the, the employee for the US government.

64
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:19.000
That's what I talked right now. So he was a recruiter looking for good people that will do a good job on fighting for the future.

65
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And good man on do something or a smart man.

66
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000
That the way I'm talking about my teacher. So when you, when he told you to join the army, how did you feel about that idea?

67
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Oh, he saw me the, the movie.

68
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Yeah, Peter. Yeah, Peter. One of the, yeah, about JFK. Yes. Okay. And in the class, you know, he showed the movie.

69
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
He said you want to be John App, can you say, why not?

70
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And, and not only one time, he asked me, he asked me a lot.

71
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And he now, something going on to the, to my family. And he can grit.

72
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
What are you going to do?

73
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Say, you're joined to the army. But I said, I don't know anything about it. That's what he told.

74
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And he go, my friend, another friend, say, take him to the, uh, joined with the special force.

75
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I said, what the hell, this special force? The people crazy.

76
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Because the Vietnam War, when a situation like it, you know now, the marionor, you know,

77
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000
course guard, you know, like infantry, you like airborne. So you know who's the one, which one the hero?

78
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And I don't know anything about it. Say, try it, try it.

79
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And they written letter to SIGON to a pastor to, to shock his order.

80
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Yes, he caught him on pastor's pastor.

81
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
He got there's strict SIGON.

82
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Yes.

83
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And I said, yeah, I, I go.

84
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So how old were you at this time?

85
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
17.

86
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
17.

87
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Yeah.

88
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And what year was it?

89
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And 19.

90
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So 1966, you're 17 years old.

91
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And you sent, or they sent a letter to SIG, telling that they've got a good,

92
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
really good.

93
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Good. He speaks English.

94
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And as a hot commodity, we need a good English speaker's interpreters.

95
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Did you have any idea what you were getting into?

96
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
No.

97
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
No.

98
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
No.

99
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I don't know.

100
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
But, you know, when we were young, we were going to be hero.

101
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We're going to be, you know, like it, stronger, more than another one.

102
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Like Jay.

103
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So I just joined it.

104
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Like Jay, okay.

105
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Yeah.

106
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And I said, hey, John, can I do everything?

107
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
You see, I'm a little bit different.

108
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
You know, from this one, he's swim.

109
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Oh, you're another iceman.

110
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I love it.

111
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
They just man.

112
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah.

113
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Took his man and saved him.

114
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Handsome guy.

115
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Yes.

116
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I like him very much.

117
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
So that's why I'm joined.

118
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
So what was your view of America at that time?

119
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
You must have had a pretty positive view of America.

120
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
You knew you were going to join the army.

121
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And you were going to support the American efforts there.

122
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I don't pay attention anything.

123
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I just want to join and join.

124
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Do it.

125
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Whatever they need to me to do it.

126
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And you know, my man, actually, you know, my, on behalf of my father, you know, most of

127
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
him, like a toned guy, cow, everybody in my village, in the county.

128
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
He's a, we're talking about the nongs, the Chinese.

129
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So they know who I was.

130
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
They know who am I.

131
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So they worked together.

132
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
We worked together at all the time in the camp.

133
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So that's why I can go with the French man team.

134
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Right.

135
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I go with the Ross Island team.

136
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I go with the Mississippi team.

137
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I got them.

138
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I got them before.

139
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I got them now.

140
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I go anywhere.

141
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Because this day, hey, cowboy, you good man.

142
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We need to learn from him.

143
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So that's why, you know, I like to go with him.

144
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
With them.

145
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Because on behalf of the attitude, my family and my father, two day of family.

146
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
So we worked together a lot of time.

147
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
One day, I get you know vacation.

148
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I want to vacation.

149
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
He said, hey, cowboy, tomorrow I got to go.

150
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
You got to go with me.

151
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I said, yes, I do.

152
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And then I quit my vacation.

153
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I go with the team.

154
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So to training is order, to learning from is order.

155
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I'm not saying, you know, I'm good man.

156
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But my experience.

157
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
When I watch young, I'm in jungle.

158
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
With my family, we work farmer.

159
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
So I'm, you know, strong.

160
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Look, skinny, but strong.

161
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Right.

162
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And sometimes, sometimes, you know, I'm, I'm thought, we got to do it.

163
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
We got to do it.

164
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
You can see my hand here.

165
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Skull.

166
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I can cut the bullet.

167
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I can't.

168
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
So I do the anime.

169
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
So they like your bullets.

170
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Cowboy catching bullets.

171
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So I'm just to prove it.

172
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Okay.

173
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
She here.

174
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I got to wounded.

175
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I got to wounded every way in my body.

176
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
When I do, she'll arrive.

177
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And I'll tell you, you're lucky.

178
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
You were skinny because if you're any bigger, those bullets would have hit more spots.

179
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
You were hard to shoot at.

180
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Yeah, you're right.

181
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Not big like a human.

182
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
When I saw him, the first I saw now, the him, he said, hey, this guy too big.

183
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
You know, he's footed at longer.

184
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
That was sales.

185
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yeah.

186
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Normally, American, the big guy, like a youth.

187
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And like a him.

188
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
But, you know, when we there, we were skinny.

189
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And a small one.

190
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Like a hundred, a hundred, a twenty-pound.

191
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
You know, look, look and hey, they're maybe shun, right?

192
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Right, that American goal.

193
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
My people, they're really shun.

194
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Little people.

195
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Yeah, little people.

196
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Yeah.

197
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
A flexion of turn.

198
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

199
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And but you grew up in the jungle.

200
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So for you being in the jungle was just just normal.

201
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
That's just, just normal.

202
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
That's normal.

203
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
You're just, that's the way you live.

204
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
That's the way you grew up.

205
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So that's a real advantage.

206
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Yes.

207
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I'm like the round eye over here.

208
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I'm not the city's looking.

209
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I can, I can, I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to tell you.

210
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
We can smell this.

211
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Just smell.

212
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Because when we go land out in the jungle.

213
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Mm-hmm.

214
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
They got a flower right.

215
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
They got a plant, the rice, or they got a plant.

216
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Home got a thing in the jungle.

217
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Mm-hmm.

218
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
We know.

219
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
We can imagine.

220
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Say, what they're going to do?

221
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Where the, they live in.

222
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And where the postgar.

223
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Where the hot spitover.

224
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And we, we can smell it.

225
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Mm-hmm.

226
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And then my six-end can understand how communist activity there.

227
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
They can grow up.

228
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
They can do anything.

229
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Because we, we, we local people.

230
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Right.

231
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
That's why the green berets love our indigenous people.

232
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Yeah.

233
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
The nuns, like he said, he could smell.

234
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
They had the extra sense that we never had.

235
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
But generally somebody like me is city slicker.

236
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
That's why people like him are number one.

237
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And they kept us alive.

238
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Mm-hmm.

239
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
In the jungle, we, we yielded to them.

240
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
They always ran point, not us.

241
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And they got me.

242
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
We local, local, local people there.

243
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And we can smell different.

244
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Like at the burr.

245
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

246
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Chicken, wait, wait, wait, wait.

247
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
We, we can, compared relation, royal weight.

248
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Incha the jungle.

249
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If you see to cry it.

250
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
That means no ordinary mood, right?

251
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
That's a problem.

252
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
That a problem is close.

253
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
We understand exactly.

254
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Right.

255
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I always say, hey, keep your fucking head down.

256
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I'm sorry.

257
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
It's a problem.

258
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
But that, too.

259
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Because people need to keep their fucking heads down.

260
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
That's the fucking truth.

262
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But it true.

263
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I'm not telling you, lie on it.

264
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
You know.

265
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And then.

266
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
What was the training like that you went through to get you ready to work with the special forces team?

267
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Did you go into the regular army?

268
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Did they process you into the regular army?

269
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Or did they just take you up to one of the, one of the, one of the C, C, and or something?

270
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Can't duck.

271
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
You just put it in duck.

272
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
That was the first, uh, saw training base was up I core.

273
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And camp duck was open, had bad weather.

274
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
But that's where they did the natural training.

275
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That's where they did the loud.

276
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Yeah, very close to the border.

277
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
How long did they train you for?

278
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Long time.

279
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Even now.

280
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000
When they send you there, you're free to do.

281
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And me, not in the long, not in the morning, wake up sick of clouds.

282
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Whatever they needed to train it, they call you.

283
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
One or two.

284
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
P, A, M, or one, A, two, P, M.

285
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And they let you free.

286
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And me, um, tomorrow we got to go range range many times.

287
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And then.

288
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
What, what are you thinking when we, you got young?

289
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
The first time that you can't go in.

290
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
We got to like a tan, you know, boxed off the baller.

291
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Right.

292
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
We go there.

293
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
We should free.

294
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Um, only my friends say, hey, how to.

295
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
We need to go to work the weapon.

296
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And then next day, we got to go range of to fire.

297
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
How to clean the weapon.

298
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And then yes, would you, would you carry an AK or you carry a car 15?

299
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Okay, the first thing when I, John, what, uh, enjoy it and joined it.

300
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Only copy.

301
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Okay.

302
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And then later, copy in the M1 and M2.

303
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And then after that, they changed to squid and K.

304
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Sweet and sweet is okay.

305
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Sweet and K and then stand.

306
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Oh, the stands.

307
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Yeah, the legs in the side.

308
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Yes.

309
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And later on, we moved to the, uh, Fubai.

310
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
We usually am 16.

311
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
They are 15.

312
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And then the core 15.

313
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
And then am 16.

314
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Right.

315
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And then the calf 15.

316
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Because they're hard to combine.

317
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
But we, we training.

318
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Ever a weapon.

319
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Like a mortar, 82, 60.

320
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Right.

321
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Yeah.

322
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Yeah.

323
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
To punch the anime.

324
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Sure.

325
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
We're trying to hone kind of weapon or be funny.

326
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I'm 72.

327
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And with these special forces, American special forces soldiers that you guys were in charge or some group was in charge of training.

328
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Yes.

329
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
That was a calm at Camp Duck.

330
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
It was the first camp.

331
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
So it's so many early saw guys were there.

332
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And that was part of the recruitment they came through saw he gone.

333
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And that's why I calmed away and ended up there.

334
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And I was training and plus the camp was so close to the board.

335
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
You had self defense at night.

336
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yes.

337
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
There would be, there would be pods.

338
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And the NVA attacked the camp several times prior to May, 68 when the camp got overrun.

339
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And it was, there's a whole book about that called bait.

340
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And, uh, after that, they closed camp duck heat.

341
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And, but that time, Alabama was already at Fubai 1.

342
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And when they closed camp duck, they would come duck and then jump over to, uh, Fubai 1.

343
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
So I get there in May of 68 later May back in tired and these guys came in with his team.

344
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And of course, you want to tell them about Alaska.

345
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Alaska.

346
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Yeah, what happened with, uh, STL, Alaska?

347
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
They blow out.

348
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Everybody was killed a couple of the one zero.

349
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
John Allen who escaped.

350
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And he can't, he need for two days.

351
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
And they caught, and he wanted to heal a cop the cops brought him back.

352
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And they said, we want to change the name of the team.

353
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
They changed it from Alaska to Alabama.

354
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And then Tim Shawf was the one zero when you're a train.

355
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
John Allen, John Allen first.

356
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
David.

357
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
David.

358
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
David.

359
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
David.

360
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
John Allen.

361
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And then, uh, team shop.

362
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And then, then, then, after we went to the Fubai 1.

363
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Fubai 1.

364
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yeah, later.

365
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
We, we got to go Fubai, no, Danay.

366
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
But we fought C.C.M.

367
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But that was the end.

368
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
But that was the end.

369
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
But this is like, May was a very incremental month.

370
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
So was that was that where you first checked in, you went to Alaska or had Alaska just become Alabama?

371
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Yes.

372
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
The first, the first.

373
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
The only reason why you didn't go on the mission.

374
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
He had, has turned a mission or he would have been on that mission with Alaska.

375
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
No.

376
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
I'm from the, it's, uh, Hatcha Fox.

377
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Oh, that's right.

378
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I forgot.

379
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Okay.

381
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yeah.

383
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Hatcha Fox.

384
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
We worked, you know, like a, the play too, no company.

385
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
To go with, after he even got a contact to the anime.

386
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And the people from the, from the recon go down to the Hatcha Fox.

387
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Looking through the bad who the good.

388
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And they say, hey, cowboy, you want to be, uh, re-continue.

389
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I say, why not?

390
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I try my best.

391
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Yeah.

392
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And the first thing I came to the, uh, to the team, re-continue.

393
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I scan it everybody.

394
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Looking, you know, bad guy.

395
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Look at it.

396
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Because he, the nuns are told in the other Vietnamese team.

397
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And the people say, hey, okay.

398
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Try your best.

399
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And then I joined the team.

400
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
At the time, at the time of that, I was going to burn out.

401
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
They didn't blow out.

402
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And when they joined it, they got to rebuild the team.

403
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And they say, hey, alas guy, it no good.

404
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Too many girls, because too many people died.

405
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So we need to change the net.

406
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Mm-hmm.

407
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And change to alabama.

408
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And then we worked with alabama until FoB1 close.

409
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And then we came to the nun, Sisiyan.

410
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Sisiyan, they got it.

411
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Alabama team, that too.

412
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So my name was Chiang to Indiana.

413
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Oh, okay.

414
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
That was early 69.

415
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
After they closed that for B1.

416
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And till it was telling me about one time when you were getting taken out on strings.

417
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And somehow you ended up upside down or something like that.

418
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Yeah, just with you.

419
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Just normal thing.

420
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
But I remember we had to contact with the enemy.

421
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:11.000
But we cannot move out here to the energy.

422
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
We each had the younger.

423
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And then the chompul came in, throwed out the rope.

424
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
One up each, we had a rope, different rope.

425
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Mm-hmm.

426
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But Tadiko for shape, for the team.

427
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
For guy, come up pick up the rope, do hang it up.

428
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And another for guy still, you know, keep them safety.

429
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Right.

430
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
This is really, keeps you safety.

431
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:57.000
And then after the chompul air, pull out the four guy, we came over.

432
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And then another for rope, throw it down, we tried to hook it up.

433
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
But I, in John Allen, another two Vietnamese guy hook up the rope.

434
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
When I turn over, you know, I try to hook myself into my rope.

435
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
But I look it up.

436
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
You know, the tree here, the rope, it turned over.

437
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Oh, the tree.

438
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
So what happened?

439
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
What are you going to do?

440
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
I say, hey, now let's look it up.

441
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And then, you know, we, we on a stable wreck, we don't have a stable wreck.

442
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
No, this is for sea.

443
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Yeah, we have a tree road to one for sea.

444
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And one for here.

445
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
And another two for sea.

446
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Right.

447
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
And John Allen saw it.

448
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
He gave me one from him.

449
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I hook it up there.

450
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
You know, the chompul is going to cut it down.

451
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
And I drop it back to the, to the plan I got to die.

452
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And then, the pull up.

453
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
I only want string in here.

454
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Wow.

455
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
You're the deering holding in.

456
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Yeah.

457
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And when they're going up like a,

458
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
a thousand feet on a thousand feet something.

459
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And then I got a roof shop here.

460
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I got a garden.

461
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I got a, you know, the, my web here.

462
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Yes.

463
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And then it going down to an over to here to my knee.

464
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You're upside down there.

465
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Oops, right now.

466
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I know that's feeling.

467
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And then John Allen won a warp it.

468
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
But, but the wind cannot be together at a time.

469
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000
So when I warp it, it going down to, to my, my dear to your feet.

470
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Now, yeah, yes.

471
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
But luckily, we're going to jungle boot.

472
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
You know the, the form that we jungle boot.

473
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Yes.

474
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
It's still tight here.

475
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
And I all the way down.

476
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So you were hanging on the rope by just your ankle and your jungle boot.

477
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
It's jungle boot.

478
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Yeah.

479
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And then John Allen should have,

480
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
because we got a flag on it.

481
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
We would should flag on.

482
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Yes.

483
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
And you know, the, the chop was still frozen.

484
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And we, we understand that we, we, we, we, we thought,

485
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
you know, they might not, might not know.

486
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Something, you know, you know, you're upside down.

487
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Yes.

488
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Yes.

489
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
So so John Allen was shooting the flare gun to try and get the helicopter pilots to realize what was happening to look and down.

490
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But.

491
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
They did the communist and the ground.

492
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So how do we do.

493
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So, you know, if flow that still flow, flow, flow.

494
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And then my, my body up and down.

495
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And until we glow to the full body.

496
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And the job would drop out.

497
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
When, when I lie down on the ground.

498
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I still understand.

499
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
I look down to the migrant, the, the magazine, the empty.

500
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I change the magazine, lock and low, the hand and do it.

501
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And then the pilot coming down to pick me up to the,

502
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
the pilot inside the chopper.

503
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Right.

504
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And I don't know anything anymore.

505
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
You're unconscious.

506
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
From there to the, to the, to the full body.

507
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Good Johnson.

508
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
You know, good Johnson.

509
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Right.

510
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yes.

511
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
The medic.

512
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And then by that time, he was all conscious.

513
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And the medic was Bruce Johnson on that.

514
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Missionary in the helicopter.

515
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
No, he, he inside the camp.

516
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Okay. He, he died.

517
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
And Bruce, what he do is elbow in your chest to wake the injured heart going.

518
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
But I still, I still know everything, even I die.

519
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Wow.

520
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Then Bruce Johnson should again.

521
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Hey, medic.

522
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
And the kind of coming in.

523
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Yeah.

524
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Pick me up to the, to the 85 posh bitter.

525
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Right.

526
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
And on the way, he, he tried it, you know,

527
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Wake me up.

528
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
The user elbow.

529
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
When they lie down here, punch in here.

530
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
You can cheat.

531
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
The bone coming out.

532
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Yeah.

533
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Hmm.

534
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Yeah.

535
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Bruce was our medic.

536
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And so he died three times.

537
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And Bruce told us about that years later.

538
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And he brought him back to life.

539
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
And they thought he was dead.

540
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
They took him down to the field hospital right there in Foo Bay.

541
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Jay, hey, I beat you up.

542
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
You, you don't wake up.

543
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
You had a die, but it.

544
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
You say, I love you very much.

545
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Yeah.

546
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
You know, you love me very much.

547
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
But I don't know anything.

548
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
But I remember I, what he taught.

549
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I remember who got the thing.

550
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
But I cannot do anything.

551
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Then me, I die for something.

552
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
And then they brought me to the hospital.

553
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Dr. Say, hey, can't do anything to me anymore.

554
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
But I remember, do you remember hearing the doctor say that they can't help you anymore?

555
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Yes.

556
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I still alive.

557
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Even, I don't do anything.

558
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
I can't do anything.

559
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
The people thought I'm dead.

560
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
But myself, I still alive.

561
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Wow.

562
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I hear what you say.

563
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I know something going on.

564
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Not something.

565
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I live in there.

566
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
I feel bruised on your chest.

567
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Yeah, even, even in my chest right here.

568
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I can't see the ball on the head.

569
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
There it is.

570
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
The special forces' medics, mental and lanceless,

571
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
the do anything to keep you alive.

572
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Yes.

573
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Everything.

574
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Yeah.

575
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
The footing keeps putting him.

576
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
He completely.

577
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
We go, we go.

578
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
He almost cry.

579
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I know that.

580
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
But I can't do anything.

581
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I've sat down long time.

582
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And then, after he tried to wake me up by least one,

583
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
and then I woke up.

584
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
You see how big the bruise, right?

585
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
He was in shape then.

587
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
After that, two hours.

588
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Three hours.

589
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
I think three hours.

590
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
I forget.

591
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Three hours.

592
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
My team came by grip.

593
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I go.

594
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And he said,

595
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
I'm a good man.

596
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
We got to bring him back.

597
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Everybody drove.

598
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
John now.

599
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Yeah, John now.

600
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Yeah, John now.

601
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Can't cry.

602
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Took a trip.

603
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Right.

604
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Do up to the hospital.

605
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Pointed gun to the doctor.

606
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Say,

607
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
You had to take care of him.

608
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Are you wondering, you die?

609
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So John Allen went to the doctor and brought a gun and said,

610
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
You have to take care of our boy cowboy.

611
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Sometimes the doctor is the American doctor's air of a reluctant John Walton did that.

612
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
They had the same problem.

613
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
They had to his missing analogous and with cowboy.

614
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
They heard they weren't getting the right treatment.

615
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
The ones that went right down there and they addressed the doctor.

616
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Because they had a policy.

617
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
No indigenous people at the hospital.

618
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And that's what they were up against.

619
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And our team leaders had to get little aggressive.

620
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
That is all that problem.

621
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Well, in this case was a car 15.

622
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Yeah, we got a young Walton.

623
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
He just read the beat.

624
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Okay.

625
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
You and Pete right now, right?

626
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
You know,

627
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
my chest.

628
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Played more.

629
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
My.

630
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Oh,

631
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Cop 15.

632
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And good.

633
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Yeah.

634
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
What do you think?

635
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Yeah, I've got to do whatever you want me to do.

636
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah.

637
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Yeah.

638
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
They came up to the hospital saying,

639
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
You better take care of cowboy.

640
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And my friend,

641
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Do you know the people drunk,

642
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
crying,

643
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
miss me.

644
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I knew I hear that.

645
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
But I can do anything.

646
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And my,

647
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
you give me a coffee.

648
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
You give me smoke.

649
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And I don't know.

650
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Maybe they put the hot water into my mouth.

651
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
And I feel something go through here.

652
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
And I wake up.

653
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
See, hey.

654
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
What the hell are we going on here?

655
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Where's the party?

656
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And let it out.

657
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
We come back to camp.

658
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
This is all before October 5th.

659
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

660
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Did you, now did you,

661
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
did I hear right that you had a relative?

662
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
That was also.

663
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Yeah.

664
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Well, his wife's brother was on STI to ho,

665
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
when Idaho got wiped out in May of 68.

666
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
That was your wife's brother, brother.

667
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Brother.

668
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Brother.

669
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Brother.

670
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Brother.

671
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Brother.

672
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Brother.

673
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Brother.

674
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Brother.

675
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Brother.

676
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Brother.

677
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Brother.

678
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Brother.

679
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Brother.

680
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Brother.

681
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Have you come to town and travel there,

682
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Where shows all that you know?

683
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And do you tell any of it,

684
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
to make sure you hold one on a shared beggining.

685
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.34
Because I found one on

686
00:41:01.50 --> 00:41:03.96
Tet, ponieważ they gave you something.

687
00:41:03.96 --> 00:41:08.96
the total line from 66 to 72.

688
00:41:08.96 --> 00:41:16.96
I mean, 66 to mid-Optus 67, the time range for training.

689
00:41:16.96 --> 00:41:21.96
In 66, I'm joined by my team,

690
00:41:21.96 --> 00:41:26.96
tier 2 August 72.

691
00:41:26.96 --> 00:41:29.96
I lost my leg.

692
00:41:29.96 --> 00:41:34.96
So these guys, you're going out the whole time.

693
00:41:34.96 --> 00:41:38.96
You're just going out on mission, mission, mission.

694
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:39.96
Yes.

695
00:41:39.96 --> 00:41:42.96
No, I mean, another way, maybe you go back to town,

696
00:41:42.96 --> 00:41:45.96
get a little break for a week or something a month.

697
00:41:45.96 --> 00:41:47.96
But most of the time, she's a work.

698
00:41:47.96 --> 00:41:48.96
Yes, sometimes.

699
00:41:48.96 --> 00:41:56.96
You know, like the, yes, I just count a month or one mission.

700
00:41:56.96 --> 00:41:58.96
Total time.

701
00:41:58.96 --> 00:42:03.96
Sometimes, only 10 days, sometimes one month, three time.

702
00:42:03.96 --> 00:42:07.96
So that's why we received the money,

703
00:42:07.96 --> 00:42:10.96
get paid for two time or three time.

704
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:16.96
Okay, for example, on the first day of the month,

705
00:42:16.96 --> 00:42:18.96
we take the money.

706
00:42:18.96 --> 00:42:22.96
We go downtown for two or three days.

707
00:42:22.96 --> 00:42:25.96
And after three days, we have no more money left.

708
00:42:25.96 --> 00:42:27.96
Yes, mission.

709
00:42:27.96 --> 00:42:29.96
Many, many, mission.

710
00:42:29.96 --> 00:42:31.96
I say, okay, we go.

711
00:42:31.96 --> 00:42:37.96
And we stand by there for a week because the weather or whatever,

712
00:42:37.96 --> 00:42:41.96
you know, the summer prison, we can not go.

713
00:42:41.96 --> 00:42:47.96
And then we went there, but, you know, the, you know, the sun glow, right?

714
00:42:47.96 --> 00:42:50.96
And when we come up to the energy,

715
00:42:50.96 --> 00:42:53.96
the company should have, we came back.

716
00:42:53.96 --> 00:42:56.96
We're not jumping now.

717
00:42:56.96 --> 00:43:01.96
And then up to few days, one zero,

718
00:43:01.96 --> 00:43:04.96
we got a pass, go past.

719
00:43:04.96 --> 00:43:06.96
He's saying, okay, for one day.

720
00:43:06.96 --> 00:43:09.96
And, you know, I try to do it.

721
00:43:09.96 --> 00:43:11.96
He, he understand it.

722
00:43:11.96 --> 00:43:12.96
No money.

723
00:43:12.96 --> 00:43:16.96
He, he took to the, yes, one,

724
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:18.96
to get a money.

725
00:43:18.96 --> 00:43:22.96
And then we on, we on past for two days.

726
00:43:22.96 --> 00:43:25.96
Or whatever, we can, we can buy.

727
00:43:25.96 --> 00:43:29.96
Because the reason we stand by for that target,

728
00:43:29.96 --> 00:43:32.96
we cannot go, you know, the long trip,

729
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:34.96
like it goes, I go on, no, that lot.

730
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:36.96
Just go away, yes.

731
00:43:36.96 --> 00:43:40.96
And then, come back for the mission again.

732
00:43:40.96 --> 00:43:45.96
We come up there because the weather or whatever.

733
00:43:45.96 --> 00:43:50.96
For up to a week, we cannot go at the weekend.

734
00:43:50.96 --> 00:43:52.96
I say, as far as October 5th,

735
00:43:52.96 --> 00:43:55.96
beginning the month, they got through the pay day,

736
00:43:55.96 --> 00:43:56.96
and the weather broke.

737
00:43:56.96 --> 00:44:00.96
Could we had rains, some, we had to end the month, soon, season.

738
00:44:00.96 --> 00:44:04.96
We stand by for the target for like it to week, three week,

739
00:44:04.96 --> 00:44:05.96
or one month.

740
00:44:05.96 --> 00:44:08.96
A lot of the reason we cannot go down.

741
00:44:08.96 --> 00:44:10.96
Weather or the,

742
00:44:10.96 --> 00:44:14.96
comment it activity underground.

743
00:44:14.96 --> 00:44:17.96
I bet, you know, like it the,

744
00:44:17.96 --> 00:44:21.96
when we went out the mission, everybody know,

745
00:44:21.96 --> 00:44:24.96
even the Pentagon or even, you know,

746
00:44:24.96 --> 00:44:25.96
that the, you know,

747
00:44:25.96 --> 00:44:28.96
here corner, Asia, it's course in Saigon,

748
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:29.96
the Noisia.

749
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:30.96
I don't know, whatever.

750
00:44:30.96 --> 00:44:32.96
We have the tattoo on the warehouse.

751
00:44:32.96 --> 00:44:35.96
We work together, I think so.

752
00:44:35.96 --> 00:44:38.96
So that's why, but we can,

753
00:44:38.96 --> 00:44:43.96
I cannot remember how many mission I got to go.

754
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:45.96
I cannot remember too many.

755
00:44:45.96 --> 00:44:47.96
Because you didn't write the diary.

756
00:44:47.96 --> 00:44:49.96
You couldn't write the diary.

757
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:51.96
You know, we can do anything.

758
00:44:51.96 --> 00:44:53.96
We can, we can say, hey,

759
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:55.96
I go there, I go there, I go there.

760
00:44:55.96 --> 00:44:59.96
But when we received the mission,

761
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:01.96
like it, yeah,

762
00:45:01.96 --> 00:45:03.96
one zero say, hey, we gotta go,

763
00:45:03.96 --> 00:45:05.96
we understand ourselves.

764
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:07.96
We gotta go DMV,

765
00:45:07.96 --> 00:45:09.96
we know the DMV.

766
00:45:09.96 --> 00:45:11.96
When we gotta go,

767
00:45:11.96 --> 00:45:15.96
we know, we gotta go,

768
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:18.96
Cambodian, Thailand, and Vietnam,

769
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:23.96
the border, we know situation from them.

770
00:45:23.96 --> 00:45:25.96
We learn from,

771
00:45:25.96 --> 00:45:27.96
from training,

772
00:45:27.96 --> 00:45:29.96
from the North,

773
00:45:29.96 --> 00:45:30.96
move it to the South.

774
00:45:30.96 --> 00:45:34.96
They got so many secret zone from the,

775
00:45:34.96 --> 00:45:36.96
from the communist.

776
00:45:36.96 --> 00:45:40.96
And we know when they move from the North

777
00:45:40.96 --> 00:45:42.96
to the South,

778
00:45:42.96 --> 00:45:45.96
how are they working on it?

779
00:45:45.96 --> 00:45:47.96
How people,

780
00:45:47.96 --> 00:45:50.96
where are they to have it?

781
00:45:50.96 --> 00:45:51.96
Like a root shock,

782
00:45:51.96 --> 00:45:53.96
like a web gear,

783
00:45:53.96 --> 00:45:55.96
who got it, like a hundred pounds,

784
00:45:55.96 --> 00:45:57.96
or more than a hundred pounds, right?

785
00:45:57.96 --> 00:45:59.96
Some sort of, yes, close to it, yes.

786
00:45:59.96 --> 00:46:01.96
But the communist,

787
00:46:01.96 --> 00:46:04.96
they don't wear anything.

788
00:46:04.96 --> 00:46:07.96
Yes, AK 47 and AK Vs.

789
00:46:07.96 --> 00:46:10.96
Because they live in there,

790
00:46:10.96 --> 00:46:12.96
they don't need food,

791
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:14.96
they don't need carrot water,

792
00:46:14.96 --> 00:46:16.96
they don't need carrot food with them.

793
00:46:16.96 --> 00:46:18.96
Because they live in there,

794
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:20.96
like in my house.

795
00:46:20.96 --> 00:46:22.96
We came down there,

796
00:46:22.96 --> 00:46:26.96
we carried it to heavy.

797
00:46:26.96 --> 00:46:29.96
Then we learned from them,

798
00:46:29.96 --> 00:46:32.96
we know how their activity,

799
00:46:32.96 --> 00:46:35.96
but I'll stop it,

800
00:46:35.96 --> 00:46:39.96
and protect this guy.

801
00:46:39.96 --> 00:46:42.96
He told big,

802
00:46:42.96 --> 00:46:44.96
and we,

803
00:46:44.96 --> 00:46:46.96
we easy to move,

804
00:46:46.96 --> 00:46:49.96
and we easy to understand them.

805
00:46:49.96 --> 00:46:51.96
But he from here,

806
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:54.96
he came to Vietnam.

807
00:46:54.96 --> 00:46:56.96
In the jungle,

808
00:46:56.96 --> 00:46:58.96
he can't do anything.

809
00:46:58.96 --> 00:47:00.96
Young and dumb.

810
00:47:00.96 --> 00:47:02.96
Young and dumb.

811
00:47:02.96 --> 00:47:05.96
But, you know,

812
00:47:05.96 --> 00:47:06.96
they good.

813
00:47:06.96 --> 00:47:08.96
Good modern house.

814
00:47:08.96 --> 00:47:09.96
So they smile,

815
00:47:09.96 --> 00:47:11.96
modern house.

816
00:47:11.96 --> 00:47:13.96
We learned from the Vietnamese.

817
00:47:13.96 --> 00:47:17.96
So on this mission on October 5th,

818
00:47:17.96 --> 00:47:20.96
the helicopter puts you guys on the ground.

819
00:47:20.96 --> 00:47:23.96
You're getting shot at before you land.

820
00:47:23.96 --> 00:47:26.96
One of the helicopters then

821
00:47:26.96 --> 00:47:29.96
get shot up and crashes.

822
00:47:29.96 --> 00:47:33.96
And the 100 says we're still going.

823
00:47:33.96 --> 00:47:34.96
Correct.

824
00:47:34.96 --> 00:47:37.96
Yes.

825
00:47:37.96 --> 00:47:42.96
When we came down to the foot shopper,

826
00:47:42.96 --> 00:47:44.96
it made me,

827
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:45.96
Jim Strong,

828
00:47:45.96 --> 00:47:48.96
and I'm not a two Vietnamese.

829
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:52.96
We got to go and now you got it.

830
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:56.96
We came down to the communist way.

831
00:47:56.96 --> 00:47:59.96
We dropped out through the ground.

832
00:47:59.96 --> 00:48:02.96
They shoot it up.

833
00:48:02.96 --> 00:48:06.96
And we are not surprised about it.

834
00:48:06.96 --> 00:48:08.96
Because we understand the situation.

835
00:48:08.96 --> 00:48:10.96
Did you see the flag that was flying?

836
00:48:10.96 --> 00:48:11.96
Yes.

837
00:48:11.96 --> 00:48:12.96
Yeah, and VFlag.

838
00:48:12.96 --> 00:48:15.96
Oh, there's an NVA flag.

839
00:48:15.96 --> 00:48:16.96
Yeah.

840
00:48:16.96 --> 00:48:18.96
That has to be a little bit of a warning sign.

841
00:48:18.96 --> 00:48:21.96
That's why Lynn argued with the ones zero saying

842
00:48:21.96 --> 00:48:24.96
that flag is at least 3000 people here and we're nine.

843
00:48:24.96 --> 00:48:28.96
Like it, the flag according from the flag,

844
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:30.96
we can make it out like it.

845
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:32.96
Not division like it.

846
00:48:32.96 --> 00:48:36.96
Reaching like a 3000 guy on the ground.

847
00:48:36.96 --> 00:48:38.96
We understand that 3000.

848
00:48:38.96 --> 00:48:39.96
Dooku.

849
00:48:39.96 --> 00:48:41.96
We understand Booku.

850
00:48:41.96 --> 00:48:42.96
Yeah.

851
00:48:42.96 --> 00:48:46.96
Then Lynn Black tried to get down.

852
00:48:46.96 --> 00:48:48.96
They got shot.

853
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:51.96
Then Kingby, leap up.

854
00:48:51.96 --> 00:48:56.96
And another Kingby, they got a Tateko from the chopper.

855
00:48:56.96 --> 00:49:00.96
Then this way, down this way, down this way,

856
00:49:00.96 --> 00:49:04.96
and shoot another place to make it difficult

857
00:49:04.96 --> 00:49:10.96
to, for communist adjustment where we're going down.

858
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:11.96
Right.

859
00:49:11.96 --> 00:49:14.96
And then another chopper.

860
00:49:14.96 --> 00:49:16.96
And it's dirty for it.

861
00:49:16.96 --> 00:49:18.96
But now drop it out.

862
00:49:18.96 --> 00:49:21.96
Press that's crash.

863
00:49:21.96 --> 00:49:24.96
But you know, we have on the ground,

864
00:49:24.96 --> 00:49:26.96
have up the chopper.

865
00:49:26.96 --> 00:49:28.96
What you're going to do.

866
00:49:28.96 --> 00:49:30.96
We got to go.

867
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:33.96
And then Lynn Black drop down.

868
00:49:33.96 --> 00:49:36.96
When we drop out, you know,

869
00:49:36.96 --> 00:49:42.96
that a plain algae, we got to move to the jungle right way to hide.

870
00:49:42.96 --> 00:49:47.96
And we got a very quick briefing.

871
00:49:47.96 --> 00:49:52.96
So you're going to do it next.

872
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:56.96
According from the pack walking up the,

873
00:49:56.96 --> 00:49:58.96
a couple of walkers was flying.

874
00:49:58.96 --> 00:49:59.96
Okay.

875
00:49:59.96 --> 00:50:00.96
When they did the insertion.

876
00:50:00.96 --> 00:50:03.96
And we got a briefing with him.

877
00:50:03.96 --> 00:50:06.96
The pack walking, saying,

878
00:50:06.96 --> 00:50:09.96
if the team wasn't going to act,

879
00:50:09.96 --> 00:50:14.96
an attraction, you have a ride to do it.

880
00:50:14.96 --> 00:50:18.96
But Jim's ride, the big guy, the one zero said,

881
00:50:18.96 --> 00:50:20.96
no, you say no.

882
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:22.96
Going, he thought, you know,

883
00:50:22.96 --> 00:50:24.96
we were strong.

884
00:50:24.96 --> 00:50:27.96
But he forgot to understand that.

885
00:50:27.96 --> 00:50:29.96
Not in there.

886
00:50:29.96 --> 00:50:31.96
3000 guy there.

887
00:50:31.96 --> 00:50:32.96
Mm-hmm.

888
00:50:32.96 --> 00:50:36.96
And not our homeland.

889
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:38.96
They're the communist land.

890
00:50:38.96 --> 00:50:40.96
They're the layers.

891
00:50:40.96 --> 00:50:41.96
Yes.

892
00:50:41.96 --> 00:50:46.96
Yeah.

893
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:48.96
So you continue to march.

894
00:50:48.96 --> 00:50:49.96
Yeah.

895
00:50:49.96 --> 00:50:51.96
That's what he said.

896
00:50:51.96 --> 00:50:54.96
And then Limbrake told me,

897
00:50:54.96 --> 00:50:56.96
let's go.

898
00:50:56.96 --> 00:50:58.96
We should go back.

899
00:50:58.96 --> 00:51:02.96
And he said.

900
00:51:02.96 --> 00:51:03.96
And then we go.

901
00:51:03.96 --> 00:51:06.96
Yeah, that was the last wrong decision he made in his life.

902
00:51:06.96 --> 00:51:07.96
Yes.

903
00:51:07.96 --> 00:51:09.96
And we moved, but like,

904
00:51:09.96 --> 00:51:11.96
15 feet.

905
00:51:11.96 --> 00:51:16.96
We show, you know, the postcard from the communist.

906
00:51:16.96 --> 00:51:20.96
Limbrake forget to tell you,

907
00:51:20.96 --> 00:51:23.96
we found the AK47 magazine.

908
00:51:23.96 --> 00:51:24.96
Really?

909
00:51:24.96 --> 00:51:25.96
Yeah.

910
00:51:25.96 --> 00:51:28.96
And then we found, you know, the rain course.

911
00:51:28.96 --> 00:51:29.96
Also right?

912
00:51:29.96 --> 00:51:33.96
Yeah, from the, from the, from the, from the communist.

913
00:51:33.96 --> 00:51:34.96
Yes.

914
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:37.96
And the tree, they let the shitter.

915
00:51:37.96 --> 00:51:39.96
Yeah.

916
00:51:39.96 --> 00:51:42.96
And the, you know, the, you know, the,

917
00:51:42.96 --> 00:51:43.96
They were sitting there watching.

918
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:47.96
Yet they, she'd have for the postcard from the communist.

919
00:51:47.96 --> 00:51:49.96
As an LZ watch stand.

920
00:51:49.96 --> 00:51:50.96
Ah, the water.

921
00:51:50.96 --> 00:51:52.96
They had a lot of those set up with different LZs.

922
00:51:52.96 --> 00:51:56.96
They were, because there's only so many in layers at that point.

923
00:51:56.96 --> 00:51:58.96
So they had LZ watchers.

924
00:51:58.96 --> 00:52:00.96
And they had some that were beginning to get platforms.

925
00:52:00.96 --> 00:52:02.96
And that's one of the first ones.

926
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:03.96
And I forgot about.

927
00:52:03.96 --> 00:52:04.96
Yes.

928
00:52:04.96 --> 00:52:05.96
You've, you've, you've, you've had about.

929
00:52:05.96 --> 00:52:07.96
And the last one is what he's talking about.

930
00:52:07.96 --> 00:52:11.96
They saw, so addition, they knew that they were compromised, but it gunfire.

931
00:52:11.96 --> 00:52:12.96
They saw the platform.

932
00:52:12.96 --> 00:52:16.96
So he had to go back and yet the ones zero said go down the trail.

933
00:52:16.96 --> 00:52:17.96
Great to have them.

934
00:52:17.96 --> 00:52:19.96
The, uh, communist, uh, half.

935
00:52:19.96 --> 00:52:20.96
Pith hell.

936
00:52:20.96 --> 00:52:21.96
Yes.

937
00:52:21.96 --> 00:52:24.96
Did the, so what was the one zero's background right now?

938
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:26.96
Like in this operation.

939
00:52:26.96 --> 00:52:28.96
He had come from Germany.

940
00:52:28.96 --> 00:52:29.96
So he's been assigned to Germany.

941
00:52:29.96 --> 00:52:31.96
He had state side duty.

942
00:52:31.96 --> 00:52:33.96
But he never been to Vietnam.

943
00:52:33.96 --> 00:52:37.96
He was not familiar with working with our Vietnamese counterparts,

944
00:52:37.96 --> 00:52:40.96
listening to people like cowboy and listening to Lynn.

945
00:52:40.96 --> 00:52:42.96
Lynn had a whole year experience with combat.

946
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:45.96
And so he was one of these old school guys.

947
00:52:45.96 --> 00:52:46.96
I'm the, I'm the leader.

948
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:47.96
We're going to do this.

949
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:48.96
Mm-hmm.

950
00:52:48.96 --> 00:52:51.96
And that was the last bed decision he made in his life.

951
00:52:51.96 --> 00:52:52.96
Took the team into it.

952
00:52:52.96 --> 00:52:54.96
And I still tell him.

953
00:52:54.96 --> 00:52:55.96
Yeah.

954
00:52:55.96 --> 00:53:00.96
And then we're not, you know, going out the trail.

955
00:53:00.96 --> 00:53:05.96
It's your own.

956
00:53:05.96 --> 00:53:08.96
We go by in the jungle.

957
00:53:08.96 --> 00:53:11.96
So when you're down at trail, that big mistake.

958
00:53:11.96 --> 00:53:12.96
Yes.

959
00:53:12.96 --> 00:53:14.96
That never happened.

960
00:53:14.96 --> 00:53:18.96
Would you guys ever have situations where the team would look at the one zero and say, no, we're not doing that?

961
00:53:18.96 --> 00:53:20.96
Well, that's what they have there.

962
00:53:20.96 --> 00:53:22.96
And the one zero overruled them.

963
00:53:22.96 --> 00:53:24.96
And most of the times,

964
00:53:24.96 --> 00:53:29.96
our, we listen to our, our business people, our little people.

965
00:53:29.96 --> 00:53:31.96
And if they said, don't go to the reason.

966
00:53:31.96 --> 00:53:36.96
And that's just the mutual respect we had for them.

967
00:53:36.96 --> 00:53:37.96
Yeah.

968
00:53:37.96 --> 00:53:40.96
Particularly once you're on the ground.

969
00:53:40.96 --> 00:53:45.96
So it's just a matter of the rapport between, this was a new team that come together.

970
00:53:45.96 --> 00:53:49.96
And they just take the experience one zero off who had combat experience.

971
00:53:49.96 --> 00:53:51.96
He had many missions.

972
00:53:51.96 --> 00:53:54.96
That Tim Shawf was the one zero prior.

973
00:53:54.96 --> 00:53:58.96
Because the other person, Jim Stride, was more rank.

974
00:53:58.96 --> 00:54:00.96
They appointed him to team.

975
00:54:00.96 --> 00:54:04.96
And they told Tim to give him another team.

976
00:54:04.96 --> 00:54:08.96
Yeah. This is why when you're in a leadership position, you listen to people.

977
00:54:08.96 --> 00:54:10.96
That's, you listen to your team.

978
00:54:10.96 --> 00:54:11.96
I mean, correct.

979
00:54:11.96 --> 00:54:13.96
This is why there's nothing,

980
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:18.96
if you're, if you're ego getting away and you say, I'm going to like these people, tell me what to do.

981
00:54:18.96 --> 00:54:20.96
It's like, okay, it doesn't work out well.

982
00:54:20.96 --> 00:54:22.96
You've got to stay humble as a leader.

983
00:54:22.96 --> 00:54:23.96
Yeah.

984
00:54:23.96 --> 00:54:27.96
Any leadership class, if you want to show what you shouldn't do, this is a classic example.

985
00:54:27.96 --> 00:54:31.96
But we don't have a training with him.

986
00:54:31.96 --> 00:54:32.96
No.

987
00:54:32.96 --> 00:54:32.96
No.

988
00:54:32.96 --> 00:54:33.96
No.

989
00:54:33.96 --> 00:54:34.96
No.

990
00:54:34.96 --> 00:54:35.96
No.

991
00:54:35.96 --> 00:54:36.96
Yeah.

992
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:41.96
We're training, yeah, the other high-vend pass.

993
00:54:41.96 --> 00:54:42.96
Right.

994
00:54:42.96 --> 00:54:44.96
And then you're out of the team.

995
00:54:44.96 --> 00:54:49.96
You have that pre-training mission where they're out of the team for the mission.

996
00:54:49.96 --> 00:54:51.96
But the team was another, with the team.

997
00:54:51.96 --> 00:54:53.96
Oh, okay, there's a different one zero.

998
00:54:53.96 --> 00:54:54.96
Right.

999
00:54:54.96 --> 00:54:56.96
So this is just, this is bad all the way across the board.

1000
00:54:56.96 --> 00:54:58.96
And this is the one with a Navy saved,

1001
00:54:58.96 --> 00:54:59.96
Yeah.

1002
00:54:59.96 --> 00:55:00.96
saved STL of Amin.

1003
00:55:00.96 --> 00:55:02.96
Because they're on his training mission.

1004
00:55:02.96 --> 00:55:07.96
And they had a lot of, it's an area where you had via Kong and NVA.

1005
00:55:07.96 --> 00:55:09.96
But Thailand before.

1006
00:55:09.96 --> 00:55:11.96
Thailand and, yeah, and VA.

1007
00:55:11.96 --> 00:55:14.96
And so they, they've got into a world of,

1008
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:17.96
trouble there, a world of shit with them on the training mission.

1009
00:55:17.96 --> 00:55:23.96
And they drove, and the NVA drove them down to the South China Sea from their high ground.

1010
00:55:23.96 --> 00:55:28.96
Because they had higher ground, jobin down, and then, fortunately, had a frequency for the Navy.

1011
00:55:28.96 --> 00:55:35.96
And one of the Navy, not a PT boat, but a boat that had two or three 50 calibers on them.

1012
00:55:35.96 --> 00:55:38.96
And they came in and picked a team up.

1013
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:40.96
Otherwise, they would have been wiped out.

1014
00:55:40.96 --> 00:55:42.96
Right on the training mission.

1015
00:55:42.96 --> 00:55:44.96
It's a rough training mission.

1016
00:55:44.96 --> 00:55:45.96
It was.

1017
00:55:45.96 --> 00:55:48.96
Calgary wasn't happy about that either.

1018
00:55:48.96 --> 00:55:51.96
No, I like it because either free, you know.

1019
00:55:51.96 --> 00:55:53.96
It can go.

1020
00:55:53.96 --> 00:55:54.96
Yeah, now.

1021
00:55:54.96 --> 00:55:55.96
Okay.

1022
00:55:55.96 --> 00:55:56.96
Okay.

1023
00:55:56.96 --> 00:55:57.96
Fishing.

1024
00:55:57.96 --> 00:56:02.96
Let me, let me pick this back up from the book on this mission on October 4th.

1025
00:56:02.96 --> 00:56:03.96
So where we left off.

1026
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:03.96
Yeah.

1027
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:05.96
There's, sorry, on October 5th.

1028
00:56:05.96 --> 00:56:11.96
Where this left off was the NVA or two rose deep front row firing AK 47.

1029
00:56:11.96 --> 00:56:15.96
The second row, the longer nades and firing RPGs.

1030
00:56:15.96 --> 00:56:17.96
And then I'm going to pick this back up.

1031
00:56:17.96 --> 00:56:21.96
It says another Vietnamese ST Alabama team member was wounded.

1032
00:56:21.96 --> 00:56:24.96
The team had to get out of the hole or die in it.

1033
00:56:24.96 --> 00:56:31.96
The bold NVA told the ST Alabama members to chew hoi or surrender.

1034
00:56:31.96 --> 00:56:34.96
Speaking first in French, English and finally Vietnamese.

1035
00:56:34.96 --> 00:56:39.96
ST Alabama's weapons drowned out further chew hoi requests.

1036
00:56:39.96 --> 00:56:40.96
The one wanted it.

1037
00:56:40.96 --> 00:56:43.96
So they asked you to surrender and you shot at them.

1038
00:56:43.96 --> 00:56:47.96
And a chew hoi was a whole program, right?

1039
00:56:47.96 --> 00:56:51.96
It was a whole program to get people to switch sides.

1040
00:56:51.96 --> 00:56:52.96
Right.

1041
00:56:52.96 --> 00:56:54.96
We had a chew hoi and then they knew the program.

1042
00:56:54.96 --> 00:56:57.96
So they used the same word surrender.

1043
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:01.96
And ST Alabama ended answered it in fine style.

1044
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:02.96
With the car fift�.

1045
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:04.96
One hand, one mega gene.

1046
00:57:04.96 --> 00:57:05.96
12.

1047
00:57:05.96 --> 00:57:08.96
That answer to them.

1048
00:57:08.96 --> 00:57:09.96
Yes, you.

1049
00:57:09.96 --> 00:57:15.96
Then it says the one one continued to pray.

1050
00:57:15.96 --> 00:57:19.96
So the one one got he kind of lost it a little bit.

1051
00:57:19.96 --> 00:57:20.96
Totally.

1052
00:57:20.96 --> 00:57:22.96
And he was curled up in a ball.

1053
00:57:22.96 --> 00:57:25.96
He was putting his face in the sand and he was trying to pray.

1054
00:57:25.96 --> 00:57:26.96
I can't tell.

1055
00:57:26.96 --> 00:57:27.96
Got it.

1056
00:57:27.96 --> 00:57:29.96
Because he owned my team.

1057
00:57:29.96 --> 00:57:30.96
Got it.

1058
00:57:30.96 --> 00:57:31.96
He was on my team.

1059
00:57:31.96 --> 00:57:32.96
I need to protect him.

1060
00:57:32.96 --> 00:57:34.96
He needed to protect me.

1061
00:57:34.96 --> 00:57:35.96
Yeah.

1062
00:57:35.96 --> 00:57:36.96
He owned my team.

1063
00:57:36.96 --> 00:57:39.96
Well, it says here, black couldn't believe it.

1064
00:57:39.96 --> 00:57:41.96
Then black says this is no time to pray.

1065
00:57:41.96 --> 00:57:44.96
Do unto others before they do unto you.

1066
00:57:44.96 --> 00:57:45.96
He yelled.

1067
00:57:45.96 --> 00:57:47.96
Whether or not the NVA soldiers were praying.

1068
00:57:47.96 --> 00:57:49.96
They continued to move around ST Alabama.

1069
00:57:49.96 --> 00:57:50.96
Some climbing into trees.

1070
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:53.96
Cowboy and black crawled 15 feet toward them.

1071
00:57:53.96 --> 00:57:54.96
Close enough.

1072
00:57:54.96 --> 00:58:01.96
So that cowboy heard the NVA commander tell his truth to prepare to charge ST Alabama's position.

1073
00:58:01.96 --> 00:58:06.96
They're you actually heard their commander give the order prepared a charge.

1074
00:58:06.96 --> 00:58:09.96
That's true.

1075
00:58:09.96 --> 00:58:14.96
The commander also told his troops on the long side of the L ambush not to fire.

1076
00:58:14.96 --> 00:58:18.96
Black quickly rigged a claymore mine in the direction of the pending charge.

1077
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:23.96
The fearless NVA mounted a charge toward ST Alabama with AK 47's on full automatic.

1078
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:25.96
Black detonated the claymore mine.

1079
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:28.96
It blew a huge hole in the NVA ranks.

1080
00:58:28.96 --> 00:58:35.96
Before the smoke cleared ST Alabama ran through the human carnage firing car 15s on full automatic.

1081
00:58:35.96 --> 00:58:40.96
And throwing M26 frag grenades while dragging their three wounded team members.

1082
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:48.96
Miraculously ST Alabama made it through the NVA wave of attackers and moved back towards the L'sy leaving their dead behind.

1083
00:58:48.96 --> 00:58:56.96
We tried to bring them a wish out of us but we could.

1084
00:58:56.96 --> 00:59:01.96
I tried to move up to work the dead man.

1085
00:59:01.96 --> 00:59:04.96
AK 47.

1086
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:09.96
I got a move back and I'm plan by going up.

1087
00:59:09.96 --> 00:59:11.96
You know the strike.

1088
00:59:11.96 --> 00:59:14.96
He took the big guy to be the first guy to whom up.

1089
00:59:14.96 --> 00:59:19.96
And I started to plan over and where they should it.

1090
00:59:19.96 --> 00:59:22.96
He took the strike body.

1091
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:28.96
And I can feeling his body shape when he hit the bullet.

1092
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:29.96
Wow.

1093
00:59:29.96 --> 00:59:32.96
So you're trying to drag his body and his body is getting shot.

1094
00:59:32.96 --> 00:59:34.96
Yeah.

1095
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:44.96
I understand exactly when I told them about the last but they never listened to me.

1096
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:49.96
Even there I heard, hey, come in and say ambush.

1097
00:59:49.96 --> 00:59:50.96
Don't kill them.

1098
00:59:50.96 --> 00:59:52.96
That's being done.

1099
00:59:52.96 --> 00:59:54.96
Oh, because they wanted to capture you.

1100
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:56.96
They wanted to capture you.

1101
00:59:56.96 --> 01:00:00.96
And then I do it a lot.

1102
01:00:00.96 --> 01:00:06.96
So if those either just listen to this cowboy keeps giving the hand signal for hey,

1103
01:00:06.96 --> 01:00:08.96
we need to circle up and get out of here.

1104
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:09.96
Get that look.

1105
01:00:09.96 --> 01:00:12.96
That's what you give the hands up for whole time.

1106
01:00:12.96 --> 01:00:14.96
Get the king bees.

1107
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:16.96
Oh.

1108
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:18.96
And then he never listened to me.

1109
01:00:18.96 --> 01:00:21.96
I know. He said go.

1110
01:00:21.96 --> 01:00:25.96
He the point man to Vietnamese team leader here.

1111
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:28.96
And Jim Schreik.

1112
01:00:28.96 --> 01:00:30.96
I'm back up here.

1113
01:00:30.96 --> 01:00:33.96
And then lean black.

1114
01:00:33.96 --> 01:00:34.96
Right.

1115
01:00:34.96 --> 01:00:36.96
I know that the absmitted now here.

1116
01:00:36.96 --> 01:00:38.96
He said go.

1117
01:00:38.96 --> 01:00:42.96
You know the rule from the team.

1118
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:46.96
The first man get up.

1119
01:00:46.96 --> 01:00:48.96
First step.

1120
01:00:48.96 --> 01:00:50.96
Second step.

1121
01:00:50.96 --> 01:00:51.96
Dog step.

1122
01:00:51.96 --> 01:00:53.96
Another man stand up.

1123
01:00:53.96 --> 01:00:55.96
And step two.

1124
01:00:55.96 --> 01:00:59.96
Do the boot where the first man is step.

1125
01:00:59.96 --> 01:01:01.96
And he stand up.

1126
01:01:01.96 --> 01:01:04.96
I saw him because I heard him.

1127
01:01:04.96 --> 01:01:06.96
I see.

1128
01:01:06.96 --> 01:01:08.96
He said no.

1129
01:01:08.96 --> 01:01:09.96
I know it's a time.

1130
01:01:09.96 --> 01:01:11.96
But he never listened to me.

1131
01:01:11.96 --> 01:01:14.96
And first step he going down.

1132
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:16.96
Then step.

1133
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:18.96
Dog step.

1134
01:01:18.96 --> 01:01:20.96
I hear the bullet.

1135
01:01:20.96 --> 01:01:22.96
And he down.

1136
01:01:22.96 --> 01:01:24.96
I turn around.

1137
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:26.96
I'm not staying there for.

1138
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:28.96
For shape my life.

1139
01:01:28.96 --> 01:01:31.96
I got to turn around and then the victory.

1140
01:01:31.96 --> 01:01:33.96
I lay there.

1141
01:01:33.96 --> 01:01:36.96
And then coming it should again.

1142
01:01:36.96 --> 01:01:39.96
Because we've had a close like here to here.

1143
01:01:39.96 --> 01:01:41.96
What? Ten feet?

1144
01:01:41.96 --> 01:01:43.96
I don't know more than ten feet.

1145
01:01:43.96 --> 01:01:45.96
Wow.

1146
01:01:45.96 --> 01:01:47.96
No more than ten feet.

1147
01:01:47.96 --> 01:01:48.96
The boots.

1148
01:01:48.96 --> 01:01:50.96
He lay him down.

1149
01:01:50.96 --> 01:01:53.96
Then when I try to move into.

1150
01:01:53.96 --> 01:01:55.96
Gathered like it.

1151
01:01:55.96 --> 01:01:56.96
S.O.A.

1152
01:01:56.96 --> 01:01:58.96
Map.

1153
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:01.96
And then the the team for survival.

1154
01:02:01.96 --> 01:02:03.96
Right in his pocket.

1155
01:02:03.96 --> 01:02:04.96
Survival.

1156
01:02:04.96 --> 01:02:05.96
And the radio.

1157
01:02:05.96 --> 01:02:06.96
The air.

1158
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:07.96
The air.

1159
01:02:07.96 --> 01:02:08.96
The air.

1160
01:02:08.96 --> 01:02:09.96
That's the way.

1161
01:02:09.96 --> 01:02:10.96
That's the way.

1162
01:02:10.96 --> 01:02:11.96
Radio.

1163
01:02:11.96 --> 01:02:14.96
I try to look how old everything in his body.

1164
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:15.96
Given to lean.

1165
01:02:15.96 --> 01:02:17.96
Given to black.

1166
01:02:17.96 --> 01:02:19.96
And try to take him out.

1167
01:02:19.96 --> 01:02:21.96
I say, hey, stop.

1168
01:02:21.96 --> 01:02:22.96
Stry.

1169
01:02:22.96 --> 01:02:25.96
It's nothing happened.

1170
01:02:25.96 --> 01:02:27.96
What do you do?

1171
01:02:27.96 --> 01:02:29.96
I try to clam up.

1172
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:31.96
And they should be again.

1173
01:02:31.96 --> 01:02:33.96
I'm lucky.

1174
01:02:33.96 --> 01:02:36.96
I'm very lucky because you know he's body.

1175
01:02:36.96 --> 01:02:38.96
It's very big.

1176
01:02:38.96 --> 01:02:41.96
When they try to move with.

1177
01:02:41.96 --> 01:02:43.96
Especially the.

1178
01:02:43.96 --> 01:02:46.96
The appointment.

1179
01:02:46.96 --> 01:02:47.96
That too.

1180
01:02:47.96 --> 01:02:50.96
So what we're going to do.

1181
01:02:50.96 --> 01:02:52.96
We can do anything.

1182
01:02:52.96 --> 01:02:53.96
But.

1183
01:02:53.96 --> 01:02:54.96
When.

1184
01:02:54.96 --> 01:02:56.96
Later on.

1185
01:02:56.96 --> 01:02:58.96
The team later in here.

1186
01:02:58.96 --> 01:03:01.96
The gun, you know, point like it to.

1187
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:02.96
To hit that.

1188
01:03:02.96 --> 01:03:04.96
But he let he didn't see it.

1189
01:03:04.96 --> 01:03:05.96
Like a here.

1190
01:03:05.96 --> 01:03:06.96
He's here.

1191
01:03:06.96 --> 01:03:08.96
He's here.

1192
01:03:08.96 --> 01:03:11.96
The AK 47 gun right here.

1193
01:03:11.96 --> 01:03:13.96
And the communist.

1194
01:03:13.96 --> 01:03:14.96
Up fret.

1195
01:03:14.96 --> 01:03:15.96
When he suited.

1196
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:16.96
We got to.

1197
01:03:16.96 --> 01:03:18.96
We got to find out way.

1198
01:03:18.96 --> 01:03:20.96
Yes.

1199
01:03:20.96 --> 01:03:21.96
And then.

1200
01:03:21.96 --> 01:03:23.96
Observe vision.

1201
01:03:23.96 --> 01:03:24.96
Hey, a case.

1202
01:03:24.96 --> 01:03:25.96
47.

1203
01:03:25.96 --> 01:03:26.96
Pointed the.

1204
01:03:26.96 --> 01:03:27.96
Lock hit.

1205
01:03:27.96 --> 01:03:29.96
And see.

1206
01:03:29.96 --> 01:03:31.96
And hit.

1207
01:03:31.96 --> 01:03:32.96
You're not the.

1208
01:03:32.96 --> 01:03:33.96
Lock.

1209
01:03:33.96 --> 01:03:34.96
Right.

1210
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:37.96
Point man.

1211
01:03:37.96 --> 01:03:40.96
Hit now going down here.

1212
01:03:40.96 --> 01:03:42.96
And it should come in and drop out the AK 47 here.

1213
01:03:42.96 --> 01:03:43.96
So you never know it.

1214
01:03:43.96 --> 01:03:44.96
From here to here.

1215
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:46.96
How do we.

1216
01:03:46.96 --> 01:03:48.96
Survive.

1217
01:03:48.96 --> 01:03:49.96
And.

1218
01:03:49.96 --> 01:03:51.96
Up and in my mind.

1219
01:03:51.96 --> 01:03:52.96
We got a.

1220
01:03:52.96 --> 01:03:55.96
Training in in in camp.

1221
01:03:55.96 --> 01:03:57.96
We say.

1222
01:03:57.96 --> 01:04:00.96
One hand connect one magazine.

1223
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:01.96
That's been.

1224
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:03.96
You ever had to get that.

1225
01:04:03.96 --> 01:04:04.96
And you have to.

1226
01:04:04.96 --> 01:04:05.96
Magazine.

1227
01:04:05.96 --> 01:04:07.96
When we throw down.

1228
01:04:07.96 --> 01:04:08.96
Hang in there.

1229
01:04:08.96 --> 01:04:10.96
We cannot throw it too far.

1230
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:11.96
We told it now.

1231
01:04:11.96 --> 01:04:13.96
It's been clear.

1232
01:04:13.96 --> 01:04:15.96
Communists around us.

1233
01:04:15.96 --> 01:04:17.96
One hanging it.

1234
01:04:17.96 --> 01:04:18.96
One magazine.

1235
01:04:18.96 --> 01:04:20.96
When we told the gun head to close.

1236
01:04:20.96 --> 01:04:22.96
We operate the.

1237
01:04:22.96 --> 01:04:23.96
The communist.

1238
01:04:23.96 --> 01:04:24.96
Pick up the gun head.

1239
01:04:24.96 --> 01:04:25.96
Throw it.

1240
01:04:25.96 --> 01:04:26.96
Right.

1241
01:04:26.96 --> 01:04:28.96
So that's why we got.

1242
01:04:28.96 --> 01:04:29.96
One hanging.

1243
01:04:29.96 --> 01:04:30.96
One magazine.

1244
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:31.96
We told the.

1245
01:04:31.96 --> 01:04:34.96
And we got a singer start.

1246
01:04:34.96 --> 01:04:35.96
Pink pink.

1247
01:04:35.96 --> 01:04:37.96
Be sure the comment is.

1248
01:04:37.96 --> 01:04:38.96
Keep that head down.

1249
01:04:38.96 --> 01:04:41.96
They don't have a timer to looking.

1250
01:04:41.96 --> 01:04:42.96
To pick up the gun head.

1251
01:04:42.96 --> 01:04:44.96
You don't want to play catch with a hand.

1252
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:46.96
I said one hanging it.

1253
01:04:46.96 --> 01:04:47.96
One.

1254
01:04:47.96 --> 01:04:48.96
One.

1255
01:04:48.96 --> 01:04:49.96
One.

1256
01:04:49.96 --> 01:04:50.96
Fucking.

1257
01:04:50.96 --> 01:04:51.96
Magazine.

1258
01:04:51.96 --> 01:04:52.96
When.

1259
01:04:52.96 --> 01:04:53.96
Because we.

1260
01:04:53.96 --> 01:04:54.96
I drill in in home.

1261
01:04:54.96 --> 01:04:55.96
Right.

1262
01:04:55.96 --> 01:04:56.96
Right.

1263
01:04:56.96 --> 01:04:57.96
And we told the gun head.

1264
01:04:57.96 --> 01:04:58.96
Pink.

1265
01:04:58.96 --> 01:04:59.96
Pink.

1266
01:04:59.96 --> 01:05:00.96
We got help to get you.

1267
01:05:00.96 --> 01:05:01.96
Guys.

1268
01:05:01.96 --> 01:05:02.96
Yeah.

1269
01:05:02.96 --> 01:05:03.96
Hold it.

1270
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:04.96
That's what he was talking about.

1271
01:05:04.96 --> 01:05:05.96
We don't have a.

1272
01:05:05.96 --> 01:05:06.96
We.

1273
01:05:06.96 --> 01:05:07.96
The communist.

1274
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:08.96
We had.

1275
01:05:08.96 --> 01:05:09.96
They don't have a timer to.

1276
01:05:09.96 --> 01:05:10.96
Thinking.

1277
01:05:10.96 --> 01:05:12.96
What are you going to do.

1278
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:14.96
And then up to my.

1279
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:15.96

01:05:16.96 --> 01:05:17.96
Magazine.

1282
01:05:17.96 --> 01:05:18.96
It empty.

1283
01:05:18.96 --> 01:05:19.96
He should it up.

1284
01:05:19.96 --> 01:05:20.96
Ding.

1285
01:05:20.96 --> 01:05:21.96
Think.

1286
01:05:21.96 --> 01:05:23.96
How the communist doing nothing.

1287
01:05:23.96 --> 01:05:25.96
Can do anything.

1288
01:05:25.96 --> 01:05:26.96
And then what we.

1289
01:05:26.96 --> 01:05:27.96
We.

1290
01:05:27.96 --> 01:05:28.96
Clear our.

1291
01:05:28.96 --> 01:05:30.96
And another.

1292
01:05:30.96 --> 01:05:31.96
Another wave.

1293
01:05:31.96 --> 01:05:33.96
One negative when magazine.

1294
01:05:33.96 --> 01:05:35.96
And then.

1295
01:05:35.96 --> 01:05:36.96
Like it.

1296
01:05:36.96 --> 01:05:37.96
The.

1297
01:05:37.96 --> 01:05:39.96
We got a big company.

1298
01:05:39.96 --> 01:05:41.96
Because everybody one.

1299
01:05:41.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1300
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1301
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1302
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1303
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1304
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:42.96
One.

1305
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:43.96
What do you.

1306
01:05:43.96 --> 01:05:44.96
What do you.

1307
01:05:44.96 --> 01:05:44.96
What do you.

1308
01:05:44.96 --> 01:05:45.96
What do you hear.

1309
01:05:45.96 --> 01:05:49.96
So they.

1310
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:50.96
Scanias.

1311
01:05:50.96 --> 01:05:51.96
How we.

1312
01:05:51.96 --> 01:05:51.96
How we.

1313
01:05:51.96 --> 01:05:53.96
How we fighting.

1314
01:05:53.96 --> 01:05:56.96
So that's why you know we try to.

1315
01:05:56.96 --> 01:05:59.96
And then we.

1316
01:05:59.96 --> 01:06:00.96
And then we.

1317
01:06:00.96 --> 01:06:02.96
Be shaped at the time.

1318
01:06:02.96 --> 01:06:04.96
Meanwhile.

1319
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:05.96
Go.

1320
01:06:05.96 --> 01:06:07.96
Go and back to the book.

1321
01:06:07.96 --> 01:06:08.96
Uh.

1322
01:06:08.96 --> 01:06:10.96
Covey says.

1323
01:06:10.96 --> 01:06:13.96
The king bees had to return to food by to refuel.

1324
01:06:13.96 --> 01:06:15.96
No extraction was possible.

1325
01:06:15.96 --> 01:06:17.96
For at least two to three hours.

1326
01:06:17.96 --> 01:06:18.96
That.

1327
01:06:18.96 --> 01:06:19.96
That.

1328
01:06:19.96 --> 01:06:20.96
Me.

1329
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:24.96
While the relentless and the relentless and bloodied NVA ran after the spike team.

1330
01:06:24.96 --> 01:06:30.96
Black planted a claymore mine with a five second time delay fuse at retavic on the hard charging NVA.

1331
01:06:30.96 --> 01:06:34.96
As a smoke cleared and the body parts settled back to the earth.

1332
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:42.96
ST Alabama split in half again and charged through the battered torn ranks the NVA warriors killing any standing enemy.

1333
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:46.96
They counted at least 50 NVA dead.

1334
01:06:46.96 --> 01:06:51.96
Again, eerie silence engulfed the team and ST Alabama regrouped.

1335
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:56.96
Just as suddenly a new wave of NVA soldiers rushed the beleaguered team.

1336
01:06:56.96 --> 01:07:00.96
ST Alabama had been pushed near the cliff.

1337
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:04.96
It was a thousand feet to the ground if they went over the edge.

1338
01:07:04.96 --> 01:07:11.96
Now online ST Alabama charged through the weakest NVA flank killing more enemy soldiers.

1339
01:07:11.96 --> 01:07:14.96
So you guys are there's thousand foot cliffs.

1340
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:17.96
There's a thousand foot cliffs that you guys are up against.

1341
01:07:17.96 --> 01:07:22.96
And jump off the cliff or go charge.

1342
01:07:22.96 --> 01:07:25.96
You may not, but it's happened.

1343
01:07:25.96 --> 01:07:26.96
Yeah.

1344
01:07:26.96 --> 01:07:32.96
And then so you guys this is an important lesson for people is every time you guys are put into a tough situation.

1345
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:33.96
You go on the attack.

1346
01:07:33.96 --> 01:07:34.96
You attack through the flank.

1347
01:07:34.96 --> 01:07:36.96
You attack through the ambush.

1348
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:42.96
And right here ST Alabama charged through the weakest NVA flank.

1349
01:07:42.96 --> 01:07:49.96
And that was, they did that several times. That's what the NVA, you know, not used to recontains charging.

1350
01:07:49.96 --> 01:07:50.96
Yeah.

1351
01:07:50.96 --> 01:07:52.96
And that's what saved their lives at that point.

1352
01:07:52.96 --> 01:07:56.96
Yeah, that's even though the Vietnam guys that taught us when I was a young seal.

1353
01:07:56.96 --> 01:07:59.96
They would say if you get caught in an ambush, you have to attack them.

1354
01:07:59.96 --> 01:08:01.96
If you stay there, you're just going to die.

1355
01:08:01.96 --> 01:08:02.96
So you have to attack.

1356
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:03.96
Exactly.

1357
01:08:03.96 --> 01:08:04.96
Exactly.

1358
01:08:04.96 --> 01:08:10.96
If we're not attacked them, they got under the red nobles.

1359
01:08:10.96 --> 01:08:15.96
So we're going to attack them and that they're scanning.

1360
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:18.96
We can turn over through them.

1361
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:20.96
Exactly about.

1362
01:08:20.96 --> 01:08:22.96
I'm continuing on here.

1363
01:08:22.96 --> 01:08:25.96
Something hit black on the side of the head knocking him to his knees.

1364
01:08:25.96 --> 01:08:27.96
He was scrambling to get up when the grenade went off.

1365
01:08:27.96 --> 01:08:32.96
The last thing he remembered was being slammed into a tree face first in the car 15 handle,

1366
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:33.96
digging into his chest.

1367
01:08:33.96 --> 01:08:36.96
So somebody hit him in that head with a grenade.

1368
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:39.96
Yeah, we don't know where that went.

1369
01:08:39.96 --> 01:08:41.96
But I'd like you for a minute.

1370
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:43.96
From the China.

1371
01:08:43.96 --> 01:08:45.96
It was Chinese hand grenade.

1372
01:08:45.96 --> 01:08:46.96
And poorly made.

1373
01:08:46.96 --> 01:08:47.96
Yes.

1374
01:08:47.96 --> 01:08:51.96
They make it by the machine and by the general in the general.

1375
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:52.96
Was that right?

1376
01:08:52.96 --> 01:08:54.96
Oh, there was like a homemade grenade.

1377
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:55.96
Wow.

1378
01:08:55.96 --> 01:09:01.96
He thought he was drowning, but then he felt feet kicking him and hand slapping him all over.

1379
01:09:01.96 --> 01:09:02.96
It was the team.

1380
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:05.96
They were beating black back into consciousness and pouring water in his face.

1381
01:09:05.96 --> 01:09:07.96
He tried to get up, but his legs didn't work.

1382
01:09:07.96 --> 01:09:11.96
From the knees down, there were no fatigue pants just surface bleeding.

1383
01:09:11.96 --> 01:09:16.96
One of the guys started smearing gelatinized rice on the one-tous legs, arms and chest.

1384
01:09:16.96 --> 01:09:21.96
Blacks, web gear, and what was left of his fatigue jacket were lying shredded bloody on the ground.

1385
01:09:21.96 --> 01:09:26.96
The car 15 was bent where the barrel meets the receiver and the bolt couldn't be pulled back.

1386
01:09:26.96 --> 01:09:28.96
One of the team buried it.

1387
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:35.96
By 0900 word of ST Alabama's precarious position, it spread through fob 1 through FB 1 like wildfire.

1388
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:36.96
Wildfire.

1389
01:09:36.96 --> 01:09:38.96
The request were made for an extra assets.

1390
01:09:38.96 --> 01:09:41.96
It was now an official Prairie Fire Emergency.

1391
01:09:41.96 --> 01:09:46.96
All aircraft were pulled from their missions and sorties to support ST Alabama.

1392
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:49.96
Any gunships attached to saw were summoned to their aid.

1393
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:53.96
The first gunships to arrive were Marine Huyes known as Scarface.

1394
01:09:53.96 --> 01:09:57.96
With them was a CH46 of a latter attached for jungle extraction.

1395
01:09:57.96 --> 01:10:02.96
When the twin rotor helicopter entered the AO, it was hammered by heavy enemy ground fire.

1396
01:10:02.96 --> 01:10:07.96
As were the Marine gunships, green tracers were seen going toward the CH46.

1397
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:15.96
The ground fire became two intense in the Marine chopper had to withdraw and make an emergency landing a camp eagle in the 101st Airborne compound.

1398
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:23.96
Despite this, despite the hit scarface gunships made several passes, expanding all ordinance before returning to base to reload.

1399
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:30.96
King B officers regrouped and prepared to fly back to Louss to extract what was left of ST Alabama.

1400
01:10:30.96 --> 01:10:37.96
The S3 asked for volunteers for bright light mission and every recon man and FOB1 volunteered.

1401
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:41.96
ST Idaho was scheduled to insert into the Prairie Fire AO.

1402
01:10:41.96 --> 01:10:45.96
The next day, six October because the team was ready to go.

1403
01:10:45.96 --> 01:10:48.96
There was some initial discussion about Idaho being the bright light team.

1404
01:10:48.96 --> 01:10:54.96
As the day dragged on, however, and the perilous nature of ST Alabama's situation worsened.

1405
01:10:54.96 --> 01:11:00.88
The bright light option faded because the original LZ was now too deadly for any helicopter to be

1406
01:11:00.88 --> 01:11:04.88
too attempt and extraction.

1407
01:11:04.88 --> 01:11:07.88
So you were even asked where you were even one?

1408
01:11:07.88 --> 01:11:10.88
Yeah, we were even one zero and that's one point.

1409
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:12.88
Yeah, don't walk along with the ones here.

1410
01:11:12.88 --> 01:11:14.88
So you guys are going to go and leg, we'll go now.

1411
01:11:14.88 --> 01:11:18.88
Yeah, we're getting ready for our mission on October 6th and then we were already,

1412
01:11:18.88 --> 01:11:20.88
and said you guys are ready.

1413
01:11:20.88 --> 01:11:30.88
Right, and then they changed them mindly because of all the intense fire and another helicopter got shot down in the process.

1414
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:32.88
Unbelievable day.

1415
01:11:32.88 --> 01:11:34.88
So walk in, walk in was the cubby?

1416
01:11:34.88 --> 01:11:36.88
Right, they rotated, walk in.

1417
01:11:36.88 --> 01:11:40.88
Then when the cubby got low on fuel and spider parks was there,

1418
01:11:40.88 --> 01:11:42.88
and he got low on fuel, pat with back.

1419
01:11:42.88 --> 01:11:48.88
So they were both the two cubby guys over there because they were really familiar with that target by that time.

1420
01:11:48.88 --> 01:11:54.88
So here we go when Watkins, who's the cubby returned at the FOB for the SESNET or refuel.

1421
01:11:54.88 --> 01:11:56.88
He told the others that it didn't look good.

1422
01:11:56.88 --> 01:11:58.88
He wasn't sure if they'd be able to get them out.

1423
01:11:58.88 --> 01:12:04.88
He explained the low sunken area in the LZ, the spotty weather and how smoke from the expanded ordinance hung over the LZ,

1424
01:12:04.88 --> 01:12:08.88
making it more difficult to spot the team and to deliver air strikes accurately.

1425
01:12:08.88 --> 01:12:13.88
A resupply of ammo grenades, claim our minds, M79 rounds, water bandages, and more fiends,

1426
01:12:13.88 --> 01:12:17.88
and more fiend was placed on a king being launched towards STL Abama.

1427
01:12:17.88 --> 01:12:20.88
And LOWS, cowboy worked on black slugs.

1428
01:12:20.88 --> 01:12:24.88
He told black that the last wave of NVA had continued onto the LZ.

1429
01:12:24.88 --> 01:12:28.88
Cowboy and black heard more US Marine, Huey Gunships arrived overhead,

1430
01:12:28.88 --> 01:12:34.88
and witnessed the NVA on the LZ open fire hammering the lead aircraft.

1431
01:12:34.88 --> 01:12:37.88
Again, the one-one panics cried and shouted skyward.

1432
01:12:37.88 --> 01:12:43.88
The Vietnamese team members speaking through cowboy told black that they were going to kill the one-one if he didn't shut up.

1433
01:12:43.88 --> 01:12:44.88
Black agreed.

1434
01:12:44.88 --> 01:12:46.88
I'll pull the trigger myself.

1435
01:12:46.88 --> 01:12:48.88
God forgive you.

1436
01:12:48.88 --> 01:12:50.88
The one-one responded tearfully.

1437
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:53.88
You and your god have no place here, black retorted.

1438
01:12:53.88 --> 01:12:57.88
Cowboy grabbed a start-up black by the throat and lifted a calf that cruis affixed from his neck,

1439
01:12:57.88 --> 01:12:59.88
and shoved his lips to it.

1440
01:12:59.88 --> 01:13:03.88
It's the god to have allowed us to get this far, round eye.

1441
01:13:03.88 --> 01:13:07.88
Oh.

1442
01:13:07.88 --> 01:13:12.88
So this is just a nightmare of a situation.

1443
01:13:12.88 --> 01:13:18.88
What are you guys doing on the ground while all this close air support is coming in?

1444
01:13:18.88 --> 01:13:25.88
I can tell you the first thing in the air that you know when the black dial,

1445
01:13:25.88 --> 01:13:28.88
you know the water in the jungle.

1446
01:13:28.88 --> 01:13:31.88
We cannot, you know, wave, right?

1447
01:13:31.88 --> 01:13:35.88
But we still pull a whole kind of water to him to make him wake up.

1448
01:13:35.88 --> 01:13:40.88
We don't know how situation we'll know the water.

1449
01:13:40.88 --> 01:13:43.88
We don't know how we'll know the water in the jungle.

1450
01:13:43.88 --> 01:13:48.88
But we still do it because we love him very much.

1451
01:13:48.88 --> 01:13:55.88
And the thing, you know, we, I don't know how to tell you.

1452
01:13:55.88 --> 01:14:01.88
I don't know how to tell you, but we got a protect by God.

1453
01:14:01.88 --> 01:14:04.88
I don't know the time.

1454
01:14:04.88 --> 01:14:06.88
The vine intervention.

1455
01:14:06.88 --> 01:14:08.88
Yes.

1456
01:14:08.88 --> 01:14:11.88
Maybe all that praying helped.

1457
01:14:11.88 --> 01:14:14.88
You know, we only pray.

1458
01:14:14.88 --> 01:14:16.88
Only, only pray.

1459
01:14:16.88 --> 01:14:19.88
I'll to end up the way we go.

1460
01:14:19.88 --> 01:14:23.88
I'll not end up the thing in my mind.

1461
01:14:23.88 --> 01:14:27.88
We should end up, they should end up.

1462
01:14:27.88 --> 01:14:33.88
And then if the god not protect me, not protect.

1463
01:14:33.88 --> 01:14:38.88
I'll remember, we not stay here.

1464
01:14:38.88 --> 01:14:42.88
That 100% for true.

1465
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:43.88
That's what I told you.

1466
01:14:43.88 --> 01:14:45.88
I can't tell you it.

1467
01:14:45.88 --> 01:14:47.88
I can't, amazing.

1468
01:14:47.88 --> 01:14:50.88
The time he lied, now I'm crying.

1469
01:14:50.88 --> 01:14:52.88
I say, hey, black, black, black.

1470
01:14:52.88 --> 01:14:56.88
He only, you know, we can't believe.

1471
01:14:56.88 --> 01:15:00.88
One one, I cannot tell anything.

1472
01:15:00.88 --> 01:15:04.88
He can't do anything to team.

1473
01:15:04.88 --> 01:15:08.88
Even, you know, we respect him a lot.

1474
01:15:08.88 --> 01:15:14.88
But at the time, what should we do in my mind?

1475
01:15:14.88 --> 01:15:17.88
God, protect us.

1476
01:15:17.88 --> 01:15:19.88
Please, be out.

1477
01:15:19.88 --> 01:15:21.88
We have a no change.

1478
01:15:21.88 --> 01:15:23.88
We have nowhere to go.

1479
01:15:23.88 --> 01:15:26.88
We can't do anything.

1480
01:15:26.88 --> 01:15:30.88
They got a thousand thousand, we only fit we are.

1481
01:15:30.88 --> 01:15:33.88
Only seven guys.

1482
01:15:33.88 --> 01:15:38.88
We did 200 and three wounded.

1483
01:15:38.88 --> 01:15:40.88
I got wounded myself.

1484
01:15:40.88 --> 01:15:45.88
I'm 70 and I wounded, black, black wounded.

1485
01:15:45.88 --> 01:15:53.88
I'm 70 and I run out the ammo, the bullet.

1486
01:15:53.88 --> 01:15:57.88
Almost we use a knife.

1487
01:15:57.88 --> 01:16:00.88
But lucky for us.

1488
01:16:00.88 --> 01:16:07.88
I mean, we can pick up the AK47 and the water from the communist.

1489
01:16:07.88 --> 01:16:09.88
And we still protect.

1490
01:16:09.88 --> 01:16:13.88
We can protect us on the ground.

1491
01:16:13.88 --> 01:16:16.88
So I can tell you it.

1492
01:16:16.88 --> 01:16:17.88
Let me go.

1493
01:16:17.88 --> 01:16:18.88
When.

1494
01:16:18.88 --> 01:16:20.88
That's all my heart.

1495
01:16:20.88 --> 01:16:25.88
Even, you know, gem strives to bike.

1496
01:16:25.88 --> 01:16:28.88
Still bike there.

1497
01:16:28.88 --> 01:16:30.88
Two or three wind of me.

1498
01:16:30.88 --> 01:16:31.88
Bodies still bike there.

1499
01:16:31.88 --> 01:16:33.88
We can't do anything.

1500
01:16:33.88 --> 01:16:36.88
When we're being up there.

1501
01:16:36.88 --> 01:16:41.88
Make me feel, you know, depressed.

1502
01:16:41.88 --> 01:16:45.88
I can only to tell you about.

1503
01:16:45.88 --> 01:16:51.88
So I don't know why.

1504
01:16:51.88 --> 01:16:53.88
My ear and me.

1505
01:16:53.88 --> 01:16:55.88
Still alive in here.

1506
01:16:55.88 --> 01:16:56.88
I don't know.

1507
01:16:56.88 --> 01:16:58.88
That image.

1508
01:16:58.88 --> 01:17:07.88
By the way, this isn't even over yet.

1509
01:17:07.88 --> 01:17:09.88
This is not even close.

1510
01:17:09.88 --> 01:17:13.88
Going back to the book, the sound of the approaching king bees ended the religious debate

1511
01:17:13.88 --> 01:17:18.88
as the realities of a surviving ashael hell became center focus.

1512
01:17:18.88 --> 01:17:21.88
The able-bodied picked up the wounded and moved toward the LZ.

1513
01:17:21.88 --> 01:17:26.88
Spider, the covey rider at the time, told black that the first king bee was en route to the LZ.

1514
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:30.88
But they planned to work the area surrounding ST Alabama with tactile air support first.

1515
01:17:30.88 --> 01:17:37.88
In this case, an F4 fanom jet pilot told black to key your handset for 10 seconds and put your head in the dirt.

1516
01:17:37.88 --> 01:17:42.88
Black acknowledges his radio transmission and told his teammates to put their heads down.

1517
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:47.88
As he looked into the sun, he observed the slowest moving full-flap fanom he had ever seen.

1518
01:17:47.88 --> 01:17:50.88
The glide path ratio was critical.

1519
01:17:50.88 --> 01:17:56.88
Seconds later, he saw the tree line across the LZ explode into sheets of white yellow and orange flames,

1520
01:17:56.88 --> 01:17:59.88
setting the jungle on fire with napalm.

1521
01:17:59.88 --> 01:18:03.88
The ship banked sharply appearing to stand its wing tips on the ground.

1522
01:18:03.88 --> 01:18:07.88
The pilot cranked the burners, dropped down into the valley below,

1523
01:18:07.88 --> 01:18:09.88
and then began a vertical climb.

1524
01:18:09.88 --> 01:18:12.88
NVA small alarms opened up on all sides of the valley.

1525
01:18:12.88 --> 01:18:16.88
The F4 took numerous hits on its armor-plated underbelly.

1526
01:18:16.88 --> 01:18:22.88
Among those shooting at the fast mover were several NVA troops about 20 feet from ST Alabama's perimeter.

1527
01:18:22.88 --> 01:18:31.88
As the napalm torts the jungle, dozens of NVA soldiers scurried into the open field to escape the instant inferno that it engulfed their comrades.

1528
01:18:31.88 --> 01:18:38.88
As a second gen, rolled in for a gun run, the NVA initiated what they called getting close to the belt.

1529
01:18:38.88 --> 01:18:50.88
In this case, the NVA soldiers moved toward or outright charged ST Alabama to get as close to the team members as possible to avoid being hammered or burnt by the Air Force Marines or Army Air Ordnance.

1530
01:18:50.88 --> 01:18:56.88
Firing on single shot, ST Alabama picked off each of them as they came out of the burning jungle.

1531
01:18:56.88 --> 01:19:02.88
The fanom's returned with two cannon and many gun runs along the team's perimeter.

1532
01:19:02.88 --> 01:19:12.88
Before the dust settled, the Vietnamese team later fell, team leader fell and cowboy crawled out and recovered several AK-47s and precious ammunition from the dead enemy soldiers.

1533
01:19:12.88 --> 01:19:20.88
As their car 15 ammo was dwindling to a few precious rounds.

1534
01:19:20.88 --> 01:19:25.88
So you're crawling out and actually grabbing the enemy weapons and grabbing the enemy ammunition.

1535
01:19:25.88 --> 01:19:27.88
From the dead soldiers.

1536
01:19:27.88 --> 01:19:28.88
That's the soldier.

1537
01:19:28.88 --> 01:19:34.88
The line down there, I pick it up. They live with the other team members.

1538
01:19:34.88 --> 01:19:39.88
Because in order to survival, we gotta do it.

1539
01:19:39.88 --> 01:19:43.88
We gotta do it. We can't eat the body.

1540
01:19:43.88 --> 01:19:46.88
Enemy put up, make the chain back.

1541
01:19:46.88 --> 01:19:50.88
To protect our people too.

1542
01:19:50.88 --> 01:19:54.88
Use an enemy body to stand back to protect yourselves.

1543
01:19:54.88 --> 01:20:01.88
It goes on here. Two of the nine cylinder king bees came chugging up the valley toward ST Alabama.

1544
01:20:01.88 --> 01:20:04.88
Black popped a green smoke marker.

1545
01:20:04.88 --> 01:20:09.88
The NVA popped a identical smoke marker, confusing the pilots with devastating results.

1546
01:20:09.88 --> 01:20:18.88
The first king bee followed the NVA smoke marker and took a direct hit from a rocket which toppled on its side, smashing each rotor blade into the ground.

1547
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:24.88
The approaching ST Alabama team members narrowly mist getting hit with strapped from the crash.

1548
01:20:24.88 --> 01:20:32.88
Black cowboy and another team member charged the rocket position, killing the three NVA before a hail of NVA fire drove them back into the team perimeter.

1549
01:20:32.88 --> 01:20:38.88
The second H34 hit an outcropping of rock on the western side of the Naule after taking heavy enemy gunfire.

1550
01:20:38.88 --> 01:20:46.88
It exploded in fell thousand feet to the valley floor below, taking with it. ST Alabama's resupply.

1551
01:20:46.88 --> 01:20:50.88
Nice going black Jack Axe.

1552
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:54.88
Fuck you Kavi hurflyed.

1553
01:20:54.88 --> 01:21:00.88
Cowboy told the 1-1 to pray for everyone except black because he was going on the devil's side.

1554
01:21:00.88 --> 01:21:06.88
Blueckbrush broke into laughter as Ysdest-Elebamos predicament.

1555
01:21:06.88 --> 01:21:10.92
Ammo was desperately low, but blood trails look like slugslime.

1556
01:21:10.92 --> 01:21:15.16
The F4 fandoms had expanded their ordinance, and Kaviy was bledgerent.

1557
01:21:15.16 --> 01:21:21.24
His nerves were shot, training and a man's basic survival instinct had completely taken over.

1558
01:21:21.24 --> 01:21:24.88
Then the NBA bugles sounded.

1559
01:21:24.88 --> 01:21:32.48
So, at this point, this scene you guys are running out of ammo and ammunition.

1560
01:21:32.48 --> 01:21:33.48
You got three wounded.

1561
01:21:33.48 --> 01:21:34.48
You got two dead.

1562
01:21:34.48 --> 01:21:36.84
No, more than two dead.

1563
01:21:36.84 --> 01:21:40.84
You're taking enemy weapons off the ground.

1564
01:21:40.84 --> 01:21:44.24
You're building a bunker with enemy bodies.

1565
01:21:44.24 --> 01:21:52.36
The helicopters finally show up to get you out of there, and they both get shot out of the sky.

1566
01:21:52.36 --> 01:21:56.36
Yes.

1567
01:21:56.36 --> 01:22:00.72
What do you think your chances are for survival at this point?

1568
01:22:00.72 --> 01:22:02.72
Only 10, I can say that.

1569
01:22:02.72 --> 01:22:04.32
Got a prototype, us.

1570
01:22:04.32 --> 01:22:05.80
No one can.

1571
01:22:05.80 --> 01:22:07.80
No one can.

1572
01:22:07.80 --> 01:22:16.80
Even not only to chop wood, now we got a large up support up the air.

1573
01:22:16.80 --> 01:22:26.48
Like a phantom, like a skyder, like a CH, a 50-3 Charlie Green Giant.

1574
01:22:26.48 --> 01:22:28.48
We can see the bird.

1575
01:22:28.48 --> 01:22:30.48
It's over the air.

1576
01:22:30.48 --> 01:22:34.84
It's not only to allow.

1577
01:22:34.84 --> 01:22:39.40
So you can actually see your air support, their flying around, their dropping bombs, their

1578
01:22:39.40 --> 01:22:42.36
dropping napalm, but it doesn't really help.

1579
01:22:42.36 --> 01:22:46.16
I mean, the fact that you guys are on the ground, even though you can see them.

1580
01:22:46.16 --> 01:22:47.16
Yes.

1581
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:48.16
I can see it.

1582
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:52.04
And then enemy voyage scanning.

1583
01:22:52.04 --> 01:22:56.36
And then we on the ground, we can point.

1584
01:22:56.36 --> 01:23:00.60
Skyder, bomb is in there.

1585
01:23:00.60 --> 01:23:02.40
And then they vanish scanning.

1586
01:23:02.40 --> 01:23:04.80
That's why we survived.

1587
01:23:04.80 --> 01:23:06.88
Another region that.

1588
01:23:06.88 --> 01:23:09.88
In this day, God came in the form of closer support.

1589
01:23:09.88 --> 01:23:10.88
Absolutely.

1590
01:23:10.88 --> 01:23:11.88
They won.

1591
01:23:11.88 --> 01:23:12.88
Skyder is our next stone.

1592
01:23:12.88 --> 01:23:14.88
You can cheat it.

1593
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:16.88
Keep your fucking net down.

1594
01:23:16.88 --> 01:23:17.88
Yes, me.

1595
01:23:17.88 --> 01:23:18.88
Bomb net to me.

1596
01:23:18.88 --> 01:23:19.88
Bomb net to me.

1597
01:23:19.88 --> 01:23:22.68
Because they upstairs.

1598
01:23:22.68 --> 01:23:26.28
They know what's where we are.

1599
01:23:26.28 --> 01:23:30.40
In the hat, you got a piano.

1600
01:23:30.40 --> 01:23:31.76
We turn over.

1601
01:23:31.76 --> 01:23:35.56
We shot the amp-lanken sheet where we were.

1602
01:23:35.56 --> 01:23:36.56
We used to do the same thing.

1603
01:23:36.56 --> 01:23:37.56
Yes.

1604
01:23:37.56 --> 01:23:38.56
Was that right?

1605
01:23:38.56 --> 01:23:41.32
That was another thing that we had known guys taught us inside of our floppy hat.

1606
01:23:41.32 --> 01:23:42.80
We had so an air panel in there.

1607
01:23:42.80 --> 01:23:46.76
So you can flip it over and let the helicopters or gunships know where we were.

1608
01:23:46.76 --> 01:23:49.000
I should have worn a floppy hat.

1609
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
What were you wearing?

1610
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
My little bandana.

1611
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
You're too cool for the floppy hat, huh?

1612
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I'm sure you got a bucket.

1613
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah, we have a hat.

1614
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.48
Yeah, I've seen China hat.

1615
01:23:58.48 --> 01:23:59.48
We got a char.

1616
01:23:59.48 --> 01:24:00.48
The panel.

1617
01:24:00.48 --> 01:24:05.88
The communist, they don't know anything about.

1618
01:24:05.88 --> 01:24:11.16
And then exactly bomb to the enemy.

1619
01:24:11.16 --> 01:24:12.16
And that's a little black.

1620
01:24:12.16 --> 01:24:13.80
It was on the radio running.

1621
01:24:13.80 --> 01:24:16.60
All the gun runs and all the weapons.

1622
01:24:16.60 --> 01:24:23.04
Like right there, they say, hey, now club.

1623
01:24:23.04 --> 01:24:27.92
But 200 feet bomb it there all your way through.

1624
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:32.80
And I want to hit you, I say 12 club.

1625
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:34.44
Five feet.

1626
01:24:34.44 --> 01:24:36.28
And that to me, yes.

1627
01:24:36.28 --> 01:24:37.28
Yes.

1628
01:24:37.28 --> 01:24:45.68
We can control the airplane, become the pad and pet walking and spider.

1629
01:24:45.68 --> 01:24:48.52
Put a cover, yes.

1630
01:24:48.52 --> 01:24:50.32
And they're able to give them the control.

1631
01:24:50.32 --> 01:24:51.32
We control.

1632
01:24:51.32 --> 01:24:53.28
We control everything.

1633
01:24:53.28 --> 01:24:57.72
But the people outside say, how do we

1634
01:24:57.72 --> 01:24:59.44
survive them?

1635
01:24:59.44 --> 01:25:02.60
It's easy to survive them.

1636
01:25:02.60 --> 01:25:06.36
Because we there, we showed the bomb.

1637
01:25:06.36 --> 01:25:08.72
Because like you said, you read earlier in the story, they

1638
01:25:08.72 --> 01:25:10.20
declared a prayer fire emergency.

1639
01:25:10.20 --> 01:25:13.72
So when the first ones out of Marines, Scarface, when they

1640
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:16.92
expanded, then the F1s came in, then the A1s

1641
01:25:16.92 --> 01:25:18.04
skybreters.

1642
01:25:18.04 --> 01:25:22.12
And then later we had Army, the judging executioner.

1643
01:25:22.12 --> 01:25:22.96
They came out.

1644
01:25:22.96 --> 01:25:25.56
Yeah, we understand that check the communist, you know,

1645
01:25:25.56 --> 01:25:30.56
very afraid to airplane, even to get a big gun or they got

1646
01:25:30.56 --> 01:25:31.88
a tank.

1647
01:25:31.88 --> 01:25:33.08
They very scanning.

1648
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:35.04
Yeah, they have two, seven, five rockets, we're

1649
01:25:35.04 --> 01:25:35.56
any gun.

1650
01:25:35.56 --> 01:25:38.20
We underground.

1651
01:25:38.20 --> 01:25:40.76
They want to kill us.

1652
01:25:40.76 --> 01:25:43.76
Very difficult.

1653
01:25:43.76 --> 01:25:46.52
And they want to kill us because they are afraid of

1654
01:25:46.52 --> 01:25:52.24
you know, they're the area that they tried by the bomb.

1655
01:25:52.24 --> 01:25:56.64
We there, we're not authorized to shoot the people.

1656
01:25:56.64 --> 01:26:01.28
But we can call a plan, even at night or day.

1657
01:26:01.28 --> 01:26:05.68
We got a communication with the air, right?

1658
01:26:05.68 --> 01:26:08.64
Yes, we got a moon beam.

1659
01:26:08.64 --> 01:26:09.64
Moon beam at night.

1660
01:26:09.64 --> 01:26:10.48
And then green board.

1661
01:26:10.48 --> 01:26:12.40
Stay airborne.

1662
01:26:12.40 --> 01:26:13.80
Come to airborne command.

1663
01:26:13.80 --> 01:26:16.80
So for all of us out these days, you said they would fly

1664
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:19.24
over and they would do common checks at night, which is

1665
01:26:19.24 --> 01:26:22.88
the moon beam, during the day would be Hillsboro.

1666
01:26:22.88 --> 01:26:27.32
They stay close and support their way above all the

1667
01:26:27.32 --> 01:26:29.88
activity with the cover and the fast movers.

1668
01:26:29.88 --> 01:26:32.36
So that's one other level of communication.

1669
01:26:32.36 --> 01:26:35.32
So if anything dropped off, like the cover is

1670
01:26:35.32 --> 01:26:39.20
we're in between, they can still talk the Hillsboro.

1671
01:26:39.20 --> 01:26:40.36
And then still direct the gun.

1672
01:26:40.36 --> 01:26:41.92
She had to talk directly to the gun.

1673
01:26:41.92 --> 01:26:43.92
She had to go to a helicopter crew.

1674
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:46.20
And Lynn did all that.

1675
01:26:46.20 --> 01:26:47.20
Which shot?

1676
01:26:47.20 --> 01:26:49.60
We got it. You know, they shoot them.

1677
01:26:49.60 --> 01:26:51.44
Winner stand exactly.

1678
01:26:51.44 --> 01:26:54.32
So we're not afraid.

1679
01:26:54.32 --> 01:26:55.72
We only small group.

1680
01:26:55.72 --> 01:26:57.72
They can't find us.

1681
01:26:57.72 --> 01:26:59.52
But they got big group.

1682
01:26:59.52 --> 01:27:01.52
Hey, you there.

1683
01:27:01.52 --> 01:27:02.84
You got a big tan.

1684
01:27:02.84 --> 01:27:03.96
Thank you.

1685
01:27:03.96 --> 01:27:04.96
Hello.

1686
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:05.60
How you doing?

1687
01:27:05.60 --> 01:27:06.60
Bye.

1688
01:27:06.60 --> 01:27:07.44
Bye.

1689
01:27:07.44 --> 01:27:09.56
Well, I'll tell you a speaking of communications.

1690
01:27:09.56 --> 01:27:12.48
I can't imagine a more horrific sound

1691
01:27:12.48 --> 01:27:20.72
here than the sound of the bugles from the communists

1692
01:27:20.72 --> 01:27:22.24
getting ready to attack.

1693
01:27:22.24 --> 01:27:26.40
That's not to be a nightmare.

1694
01:27:26.40 --> 01:27:30.40
You know, we, we come there.

1695
01:27:30.40 --> 01:27:32.80
There, their house.

1696
01:27:32.80 --> 01:27:37.96
They're afraid to Detroit their house.

1697
01:27:37.96 --> 01:27:41.12
So we want to, they want to kill us.

1698
01:27:41.12 --> 01:27:42.64
It's not easy.

1699
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:43.84
Not going to be easy.

1700
01:27:43.84 --> 01:27:45.24
It's not easy.

1701
01:27:45.24 --> 01:27:47.36
Because we learn the last.

1702
01:27:47.36 --> 01:27:50.56
We're training a lot.

1703
01:27:50.56 --> 01:27:53.20
We know when, when we came out there,

1704
01:27:53.20 --> 01:27:55.92
we got a bit fined.

1705
01:27:55.92 --> 01:27:59.44
How many enemy underground?

1706
01:27:59.44 --> 01:28:06.08
Where we can hide and where we can put the top.

1707
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:09.48
I mean, am 14, my two powers.

1708
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:13.56
Yeah, top up, where we can put it play more money.

1709
01:28:13.56 --> 01:28:17.08
We can put it, yeah, she for.

1710
01:28:17.08 --> 01:28:21.72
And we know situation underground.

1711
01:28:21.72 --> 01:28:29.64
We know everywhere, especially we got a spirit in the jungle.

1712
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:35.24
And you American, you know, situation, you know,

1713
01:28:35.24 --> 01:28:40.84
not like with the American, and Vietnamese, or whatever,

1714
01:28:40.84 --> 01:28:46.20
I'm no, I'm better than the people from the north.

1715
01:28:46.20 --> 01:28:51.80
So we understand exactly when they're moving.

1716
01:28:51.80 --> 01:28:56.36
I look in the jungle, I look in the mountain.

1717
01:28:56.36 --> 01:28:59.64
And I can see it.

1718
01:28:59.64 --> 01:29:01.64
Where are they?

1719
01:29:01.64 --> 01:29:03.24
In that way, you could help Lynne Black,

1720
01:29:03.24 --> 01:29:07.32
direct the air strikes, or you saw the most enemy activity.

1721
01:29:07.32 --> 01:29:13.40
Right here, by the way, day by day, we got a spirit.

1722
01:29:13.40 --> 01:29:16.84
I'm not too good, but with my spirit,

1723
01:29:16.84 --> 01:29:18.36
I can look and up the jungle.

1724
01:29:18.36 --> 01:29:24.12
The mountain here, like I can say, hey, I'm right here.

1725
01:29:24.12 --> 01:29:27.000
Say, hey, Black, we down here.

1726
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.28
I drift the location for him.

1727
01:29:30.28 --> 01:29:34.52
And then that is where it is.

1728
01:29:34.52 --> 01:29:39.08
But then after the bugles blue, then things got ugly again.

1729
01:29:39.08 --> 01:29:39.64
Yeah, here.

1730
01:29:39.64 --> 01:29:42.04
But then you had your walls built.

1731
01:29:42.04 --> 01:29:43.80
Yeah, let me pick it up.

1732
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:49.40
So the NVA bugles sounded waves of NVA troops carrying SKS

1733
01:29:49.40 --> 01:29:53.000
is with fixed bayonets advanced on STL Abama.

1734
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.16
When they were 15 feet away, STL Abama opened fire.

1735
01:29:57.16 --> 01:30:01.96
The semi-automatic SKS is where no match for the fully automatic firepower of the spike team.

1736
01:30:01.96 --> 01:30:05.96
After the first burst of full automatic fire, the team went to single shot.

1737
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:11.56
It was another turkey shoot without a word, a look, or a plan acting solely on instinct.

1738
01:30:11.56 --> 01:30:12.52
All of them.

1739
01:30:12.52 --> 01:30:18.84
Except the one one, scurried forward and dragged back dead NVA placing the bodies in a circle

1740
01:30:18.84 --> 01:30:21.48
around them and stacking them high.

1741
01:30:21.48 --> 01:30:24.60
The deadly skirmish and continued for several hours

1742
01:30:24.60 --> 01:30:30.76
before Kavie told Black that more gunships and five jolly green giants with heavily armored

1743
01:30:30.76 --> 01:30:33.32
secorceky HH3Es were en route.

1744
01:30:34.60 --> 01:30:39.24
Blackjack Kavie, what you're up against is the regiment you are sent to find over.

1745
01:30:40.52 --> 01:30:42.44
And Blackjack replies, is that all?

1746
01:30:42.44 --> 01:30:44.04
Only 3,000 of the bastards?

1747
01:30:44.04 --> 01:30:45.72
Well, I think we made a dent in them.

1748
01:30:45.72 --> 01:30:46.52
Who's winning?

1749
01:30:47.72 --> 01:30:49.72
They are Kavie responded.

1750
01:30:49.72 --> 01:30:53.24
As Blackfinished his combo, he saw sight he would never forget.

1751
01:30:53.24 --> 01:30:59.08
The NVA formed a front line of NVA troops, who were firing their AK-47s.

1752
01:30:59.08 --> 01:31:04.68
Behind them were several NVA soldiers swinging fangs made of leather and cloth,

1753
01:31:04.68 --> 01:31:07.72
which held 3-5 hand grenades each.

1754
01:31:07.72 --> 01:31:13.96
With a jerk of their collective wrists, the NVA hurlers launched more than 2 dozen communist

1755
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:16.60
manufactured grenades at ST Alabama.

1756
01:31:17.64 --> 01:31:19.56
The sky was full of grenades.

1757
01:31:20.52 --> 01:31:22.52
Fortunately, they weren't US grenades.

1758
01:31:22.52 --> 01:31:25.96
They hit the ground and threw dirt smoke and dust all over the place.

1759
01:31:25.96 --> 01:31:29.40
ST Alabama looked up just as the AKs started again.

1760
01:31:29.40 --> 01:31:34.28
And behind them, the fangs whirling overhead like helicopter blades.

1761
01:31:34.28 --> 01:31:37.32
When the AKs stopped, the grenades were released.

1762
01:31:37.32 --> 01:31:39.24
ST Alabama fired.

1763
01:31:39.24 --> 01:31:40.92
More grenades were released.

1764
01:31:40.92 --> 01:31:43.08
Alabama threw some back.

1765
01:31:43.08 --> 01:31:47.88
ST Alabama was caught in a deadly version of the kid game pop goes the weasel.

1766
01:31:47.88 --> 01:31:52.84
The AK-47s continued to roar. Alabama ducked. The grenades were launched.

1767
01:31:52.84 --> 01:31:58.12
Alabama rocked. Catch duck, throw duck, catch throw.

1768
01:31:58.92 --> 01:32:01.32
The NVA advanced.

1769
01:32:01.32 --> 01:32:06.44
Grnage, shrapnel, several severed the antenna of the PRC-25 radio.

1770
01:32:07.72 --> 01:32:11.000
He quickly black quickly rigged an impromptu antenna from wire.

1771
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.08
The relentless NVA continued to advance inch by bloody inch.

1772
01:32:15.08 --> 01:32:21.88
Cowboy took two Vietnamese team members over the Knaver Wald perimeter,

1773
01:32:21.88 --> 01:32:26.68
seeking to get another line of fire to direct at the advancing NVA.

1774
01:32:26.68 --> 01:32:31.000
The advance continued despite firing from black and the remaining Vietnamese team members.

1775
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.04
The NVA were now merely feet away from the perimeter.

1776
01:32:35.16 --> 01:32:35.64
She's.

1777
01:32:35.64 --> 01:32:37.64
Do you believe it?

1778
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.92
I can't believe you're sitting here talking to me.

1779
01:32:42.28 --> 01:32:43.32
Really, even now.

1780
01:32:43.32 --> 01:32:44.76
Yeah. She's.

1781
01:32:48.12 --> 01:32:50.84
Throwing bunches of grenades.

1782
01:32:52.84 --> 01:32:55.16
That's just a horror show.

1783
01:32:55.16 --> 01:32:56.60
That's crazy.

1784
01:32:56.60 --> 01:32:58.60
That's the first time we ever saw that, right?

1785
01:32:58.60 --> 01:32:59.64
Yes.

1786
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:00.20
Yeah.

1787
01:33:00.20 --> 01:33:00.84
Yes.

1788
01:33:00.84 --> 01:33:02.20
A new tactic.

1789
01:33:06.04 --> 01:33:06.92
We live in here.

1790
01:33:06.92 --> 01:33:11.32
They here.

1791
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:13.96
Here the bell is going down here.

1792
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:17.40
The twisting we at the top.

1793
01:33:17.40 --> 01:33:19.40
So there's a little ridge line.

1794
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:20.28
Yes.

1795
01:33:20.28 --> 01:33:22.04
And they're on one side of the ridge line.

1796
01:33:22.04 --> 01:33:22.52
Yes.

1797
01:33:22.52 --> 01:33:23.96
You're on the other side of the ridge line.

1798
01:33:25.24 --> 01:33:26.68
And then they shoot up.

1799
01:33:26.68 --> 01:33:27.64
We're going down here.

1800
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:31.80
We move to, you know, we got a high in here, the cover, Earth.

1801
01:33:32.92 --> 01:33:34.44
And the net troll here.

1802
01:33:34.44 --> 01:33:36.84
So they're throwing grenades over the ridge line,

1803
01:33:36.84 --> 01:33:37.88
ideas.

1804
01:33:37.88 --> 01:33:45.08
And then as you, as I say, the common is it not training well.

1805
01:33:46.44 --> 01:33:48.76
So if you know, they do a good at that.

1806
01:33:49.56 --> 01:33:50.68
Put it down.

1807
01:33:50.68 --> 01:33:51.72
Come in here.

1808
01:33:51.72 --> 01:33:53.64
One, two, three, four.

1809
01:33:53.64 --> 01:33:54.28
They troll it.

1810
01:33:55.48 --> 01:33:57.000
We got to die everybody.

1811
01:33:57.72 --> 01:34:00.68
But they just pulled the pin and they just pulled the pin and then troll it.

1812
01:34:00.68 --> 01:34:02.04
They didn't cook them at all.

1813
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:02.52
Yes.

1814
01:34:02.52 --> 01:34:04.68
And we have a time.

1815
01:34:05.08 --> 01:34:06.44
We have a time with two pick it up.

1816
01:34:07.40 --> 01:34:08.04
And troll it back.

1817
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:12.68
Because they are not well-training.

1818
01:34:13.72 --> 01:34:17.40
But with those, hang an edit, put it out.

1819
01:34:18.92 --> 01:34:19.64
Come in.

1820
01:34:19.64 --> 01:34:20.92
One, two, three.

1821
01:34:20.92 --> 01:34:21.48
And troll it.

1822
01:34:22.36 --> 01:34:25.32
When the pick it up, it can be a blow it out.

1823
01:34:26.44 --> 01:34:31.16
That's why we can succeed at it.

1824
01:34:31.16 --> 01:34:32.04
Come in.

1825
01:34:32.04 --> 01:34:33.56
It's not well-training.

1826
01:34:34.76 --> 01:34:37.32
Or whatever they're not training at all.

1827
01:34:38.36 --> 01:34:40.36
They just know, put it out and troll it.

1828
01:34:41.72 --> 01:34:42.36
That's why we...

1829
01:34:42.36 --> 01:34:43.24
Lucky for you.

1830
01:34:43.24 --> 01:34:43.64
Yeah.

1831
01:34:43.64 --> 01:34:44.84
We still survive.

1832
01:34:45.64 --> 01:34:46.44
Oh.

1833
01:34:46.44 --> 01:34:48.60
The people that they don't understand, they say, hey,

1834
01:34:49.88 --> 01:34:51.24
the guy is liar.

1835
01:34:52.04 --> 01:34:52.44
No.

1836
01:34:53.72 --> 01:34:54.76
It's not a liar.

1837
01:34:55.16 --> 01:34:57.16
But they're training.

1838
01:34:57.16 --> 01:34:59.96
It's not not not well.

1839
01:34:59.96 --> 01:35:00.92
Not good.

1840
01:35:01.56 --> 01:35:02.44
So that's why we...

1841
01:35:03.48 --> 01:35:04.68
We here, liar.

1842
01:35:04.68 --> 01:35:05.40
Yeah.

1843
01:35:05.40 --> 01:35:06.28
It's likely good.

1844
01:35:08.28 --> 01:35:11.000
Going back to the book at the last moment with the NVA,

1845
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.48
a few body lengths away from the perimeter.

1846
01:35:13.48 --> 01:35:16.28
Two Huey gunships from the AmeriCorps Division.

1847
01:35:16.28 --> 01:35:19.40
176 aviation company, the minute men,

1848
01:35:19.40 --> 01:35:22.12
muskets of the 36 Charlie arrived.

1849
01:35:22.12 --> 01:35:27.000
The UH-1B pilots were codenamed the judge and the executioner.

1850
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.04
They roared into battle first with a mini gun blast,

1851
01:35:30.04 --> 01:35:34.20
followed seconds later with several 2.75 millimeter rockets

1852
01:35:34.20 --> 01:35:35.48
placed in the NVA ranks.

1853
01:35:35.48 --> 01:35:36.60
Alabama was saved,

1854
01:35:36.60 --> 01:35:37.96
definitely for a little while.

1855
01:35:37.96 --> 01:35:39.88
The NVA backed off for a few moments,

1856
01:35:39.88 --> 01:35:42.04
briefly looking their collective wounds.

1857
01:35:42.04 --> 01:35:43.56
Although they were far from whipped.

1858
01:35:44.28 --> 01:35:46.76
New assault lines of the NVA troops formed.

1859
01:35:46.76 --> 01:35:50.04
Before the NVA opened fire on ST Alabama, however,

1860
01:35:50.04 --> 01:35:53.32
the executioner confronted the NVA head on.

1861
01:35:53.32 --> 01:35:56.60
With both doorgunners blazing away with their handheld M60

1862
01:35:56.60 --> 01:35:59.24
machine guns, he hovered inches off the ground

1863
01:35:59.24 --> 01:36:01.40
between the team and the front of the NVA.

1864
01:36:01.40 --> 01:36:04.60
And skipped several 2.75 millimeter rockets

1865
01:36:04.60 --> 01:36:06.84
off the ground into the NVA.

1866
01:36:06.84 --> 01:36:09.88
Before the bleeding startled NVA could respond,

1867
01:36:09.88 --> 01:36:13.000
the pilot lifted the old UH-1B models'

1868
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.12
gunship over the tree line and ducked down into the canyon,

1869
01:36:16.12 --> 01:36:19.08
regaining enough airspeed to return for another pass

1870
01:36:19.08 --> 01:36:21.000
at the ST Alabama perimeter.

1871
01:36:22.12 --> 01:36:24.44
Before ST Alabama could celebrate,

1872
01:36:24.44 --> 01:36:26.44
the NVA charged again.

1873
01:36:26.44 --> 01:36:29.56
Three more dead NVA were added to the cadaver wall.

1874
01:36:29.56 --> 01:36:31.56
Silence dominated the battlefield.

1875
01:36:31.56 --> 01:36:34.44
No bird chirps, no speaking, no noise of any type.

1876
01:36:34.44 --> 01:36:37.48
Even the aircraft over the scene had flown far enough away

1877
01:36:37.48 --> 01:36:40.12
that their absence amplified the MTR.

1878
01:36:40.12 --> 01:36:43.56
The one-one who hadn't fired a single shock continued to pray.

1879
01:36:43.56 --> 01:36:46.12
Black patched up a bleeding cowboy.

1880
01:36:46.12 --> 01:36:50.28
He gave him some morphine before bandaging a wound on the right side,

1881
01:36:50.28 --> 01:36:53.16
on his right side from an AK-47 round.

1882
01:36:53.16 --> 01:36:54.92
Where's John Wayne when you need him?

1883
01:36:54.92 --> 01:36:55.72
Cowboy asked.

1884
01:36:57.72 --> 01:36:58.76
The other's laughed.

1885
01:36:59.80 --> 01:37:01.48
Chuhoy Duma.

1886
01:37:01.48 --> 01:37:04.44
Give up mother fuckers an enemy soldier yelled.

1887
01:37:05.40 --> 01:37:07.40
Another NVA told Black to chew,

1888
01:37:07.40 --> 01:37:08.20
hoi in English.

1889
01:37:09.24 --> 01:37:11.08
Black flipped in the bird as a sniper,

1890
01:37:11.08 --> 01:37:13.80
sniper shot, Alabama's tail gunner.

1891
01:37:13.80 --> 01:37:17.56
Quang, Zerite Quang, Quang, Quang in the crotch,

1892
01:37:17.56 --> 01:37:20.44
heating an artery as though a pride direct

1893
01:37:20.44 --> 01:37:24.36
pressure pressure quang's wound, an A1E,

1894
01:37:24.36 --> 01:37:26.36
skyrader lumbered into the AO,

1895
01:37:26.36 --> 01:37:28.76
flown by pilot code named Snoopy.

1896
01:37:28.76 --> 01:37:30.44
He roared in from Black's left,

1897
01:37:30.44 --> 01:37:34.20
brushing the tree tops, full flaps, working his throttle.

1898
01:37:34.20 --> 01:37:37.56
The aircraft was so close to the team that Black could hear the distinctive

1899
01:37:37.56 --> 01:37:40.20
metallic click-click of the Napalm canisters,

1900
01:37:40.20 --> 01:37:42.92
being released from the old Korean war era plane.

1901
01:37:42.92 --> 01:37:45.96
The skyrader appeared to be falling, but it actually slipped

1902
01:37:45.96 --> 01:37:48.76
down into the valley to escape NVA gunfire.

1903
01:37:48.76 --> 01:37:52.60
As the America-UH-1B gunships and fast movers had maneuvered

1904
01:37:52.60 --> 01:37:55.48
earlier in the day, his wingman appeared as he flew,

1905
01:37:55.48 --> 01:37:57.48
and he as he flew over the team,

1906
01:37:57.48 --> 01:37:59.80
they could hear the nuts and bolts of God knows what,

1907
01:37:59.80 --> 01:38:02.92
creaking and groaning as he saw the salvo, the rockets.

1908
01:38:02.92 --> 01:38:04.36
The NVA were pissed.

1909
01:38:04.36 --> 01:38:07.40
Again, the hot shell casings from the airborne warships

1910
01:38:07.40 --> 01:38:09.000
rain down on ST Alabama.

1911
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.36
Where's John Wayne when you need him?

1912
01:38:12.36 --> 01:38:19.000
Great lines.

1913
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Oh, did you got shot with AK?

1914
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Yes.

1915
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.20
Do you want to see Scar?

1916
01:38:28.20 --> 01:38:31.96
No, I'll take your word for it, sir.

1917
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:34.36
He's got so many scars.

1918
01:38:34.36 --> 01:38:35.80
Many scars.

1919
01:38:35.80 --> 01:38:43.80
Yeah, it's crazy to think you're so close to these guys

1920
01:38:43.80 --> 01:38:44.92
that you're talking to him.

1921
01:38:44.92 --> 01:38:47.16
You're yelling out too, boy, chew, hoe, do-ma.

1922
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:49.80
Oh, yeah.

1923
01:38:49.80 --> 01:38:51.16
God.

1924
01:38:51.16 --> 01:38:53.000
They are the way you call it.

1925
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.20
They what?

1926
01:38:54.20 --> 01:38:55.56
The kind of an enemy?

1927
01:38:55.56 --> 01:38:57.16
One of the way chew a hoe.

1928
01:38:59.64 --> 01:39:00.44
Get the fuck in.

1929
01:39:00.44 --> 01:39:04.04
Thank you.

1930
01:39:04.04 --> 01:39:06.60
Then three small mortars opened fire.

1931
01:39:06.60 --> 01:39:11.48
Black knew there was no way in hell any of the teams could catch the mortars and throw them back.

1932
01:39:12.04 --> 01:39:16.52
He and the Vietnamese team leader fell rolled over the cadaver wall toward the mortars cautiously

1933
01:39:16.52 --> 01:39:21.48
picking their way through the charred NVA bodies and carnage from the previous airborne assaults.

1934
01:39:21.48 --> 01:39:24.60
They moved into the jungle within 20 feet of them first mortar tube,

1935
01:39:24.60 --> 01:39:26.36
pho-jue of plan in the ground.

1936
01:39:26.36 --> 01:39:30.60
He would hit tube one, black would hit tube three and they'd combine on take tube two.

1937
01:39:30.60 --> 01:39:35.40
After the mortarmen launched three salvos, pho-opened on his target while black attacked his target

1938
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:39.32
tube and several NVA, several nearby NVA soldiers.

1939
01:39:39.32 --> 01:39:44.28
The survivors chased black in the confusion the NVA opened fire on each other as black

1940
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:49.48
headed toward two one with NVA soldiers still chasing him where pho was pinned down.

1941
01:39:49.48 --> 01:39:54.28
Black threw a hand grenade and killed at least three NVA with a blast of gunfire to free pho.

1942
01:39:54.28 --> 01:39:57.72
They turned on the NVA chasing black and dealt with them.

1943
01:39:57.72 --> 01:40:02.84
Then he and pho wiped out the NVA at the second tube before they quickly returned to the team,

1944
01:40:02.84 --> 01:40:07.96
all while picking up ammo and loaded AK-47 magazines from dead or wounded NVA soldiers.

1945
01:40:08.52 --> 01:40:12.76
By now, walkings had returned to flying, cover writer above ST Alabamaer.

1946
01:40:12.76 --> 01:40:17.72
Spider had called the US Air Force 37th Air Rescue and Recovery Group and denanged to attempt to

1947
01:40:17.72 --> 01:40:24.44
rescue the rest of SKU ST Alabama. During the Vietnam War, when pilots were shot down in the north

1948
01:40:24.44 --> 01:40:28.92
Vietnam were lost and all else failed, the jolly-green giants were called.

1949
01:40:28.92 --> 01:40:37.08
The Sircorske H.H. 3E weighed 22,000 pounds loaded and had two general electric T-58 GE-5 Turbo

1950
01:40:37.08 --> 01:40:42.76
shaft, 1500 horsepower engines, extra armament and firepower and they were manned by remarkable

1951
01:40:42.76 --> 01:40:49.40
Air Force pilots and crews. The first heavily armored jolly-green giant codenamed JG-28

1952
01:40:49.40 --> 01:40:55.72
started its descent to the LZ from 4,000 feet. As it approached, the JG crew was looking for an

1953
01:40:55.72 --> 01:41:01.000
orange panel on the southeast side of the LZ. However, as the aircraft was about to touch down,

1954
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.44
crew members noticed the second panel. The NVA had an identical panel. The momentary pause was

1955
01:41:06.44 --> 01:41:12.60
nearly fatal for JG-28 as the NVA opened fire on it from several sides, the heavy gunfire

1956
01:41:12.60 --> 01:41:17.56
severed the main fuel line, causing a massive fuel leak inside the helicopter.

1957
01:41:17.56 --> 01:41:23.40
JG-28 had to withdraw from the LZ. In a matter of seconds, there were two or three inches of aviation

1958
01:41:23.40 --> 01:41:29.24
fuel on the aircraft's cabin floor. The fumes temporarily blinded the crew members. The pilot

1959
01:41:29.24 --> 01:41:35.56
was able to stabilize and returned to denying. As JG-10 hovered a safe distance away from the LZ,

1960
01:41:35.56 --> 01:41:40.76
walk-consdirected a few more air strikes around ST Alabama with the hope that the Communist soldiers

1961
01:41:40.76 --> 01:41:45.96
would put their heads down long enough for the team to get out. After a few years, air strikes

1962
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:53.56
JG-10 piloted by Air Force Major Vernon Sam Grineer was called to attempt the extraction.

1963
01:41:53.56 --> 01:41:58.68
For Grineer, this was his first assignment in the Prairie Fire AL was a Jolly Green Giant pilot.

1964
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:03.80
Way, welcome to Grunt welcome to Prairie Fire. Oh yeah. When the call from Kovie came,

1965
01:42:03.80 --> 01:42:07.96
Grineer knew that there were two U.S. Green berets on the ground with their via-to-meast

1966
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:12.92
team members and that the majority of the team was wounded. He didn't hesitate. Grineer piloted

1967
01:42:12.92 --> 01:42:19.88
the Jolly Green Giant toward the LZ. Unlike JG-28 Grineer, new which side of the LZ ST Alabama was

1968
01:42:19.88 --> 01:42:26.28
on. As he approached the LZ, NVA gunfire again reached a deafening roar, despite ST Alabama

1969
01:42:26.28 --> 01:42:32.60
directing firepower at the Communist soldiers. As Grineer began to hover over the LZ, JG-10 was hammered

1970
01:42:32.60 --> 01:42:38.92
by enemy gunfire. His crew chief reported that one NVA round had torus six inch hole through

1971
01:42:38.92 --> 01:42:43.40
the floor. The round apparently slammed into one of the engines. Both engine warning lights went

1972
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:49.40
on. Both engines were on fire. Grineer did a 180 degree turn and moved to damage air craft away

1973
01:42:49.40 --> 01:42:54.44
from the deadly enemy fire and away from the team, struggling to keep an airborne, calling upon

1974
01:42:54.44 --> 01:42:58.60
all the training he had received to continue flying. Both crew members continued firing the

1975
01:42:58.60 --> 01:43:04.20
machine guns as Grineer battled to keep the ship in the air. Time ran out for JG-10. After traveling

1976
01:43:04.20 --> 01:43:09.72
several hundred yards, Grineer warned his crew to brace themselves for a crash landing. Both crew

1977
01:43:09.72 --> 01:43:15.24
members continued firing their weapons until the burning HH-3E slammed into the jungle.

1978
01:43:18.76 --> 01:43:24.20
ST Alabama was stunned. Covey and all the men flying over the target area viewed the

1979
01:43:24.20 --> 01:43:33.88
horror and grim silence. What's that four helicopters have gone down now? Five? Including the first,

1980
01:43:33.88 --> 01:43:43.64
the first one on insert? Four. Four. Four. The men back at FOB one monitored the radio transmissions

1981
01:43:43.64 --> 01:43:49.64
on their PRC 25s as Covey talked to black. Spike Team Alabama's radio signal was too weak to

1982
01:43:49.64 --> 01:43:53.56
hear any response. The word spread through camp that the latest horrific turn of events

1983
01:43:53.56 --> 01:44:00.20
surrounding ST Alabama, the usual hustle bustle of a Saturday at FOB one was replaced by quiet

1984
01:44:00.20 --> 01:44:05.96
hush tones as the entire compound feared the worst, but continued to pray for the men of ST Alabama.

1985
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:12.68
Word of a proposed arc light mission reinforced the gravity of ST Alabama's situation, and

1986
01:44:12.68 --> 01:44:21.16
arc light was a strike by a B-52 bomber from more than 25,000 feet. Back in Louss, the stunned

1987
01:44:21.16 --> 01:44:26.60
members of ST Alabama returned to their cadaver perimeter once again nearly out of ammo.

1988
01:44:26.60 --> 01:44:31.88
One one was facing down, met her muttering, the Lord is my shepherd, one of the Vietnamese went

1989
01:44:31.88 --> 01:44:38.12
about collecting AK-47's in ammo from the dead NVA as spider-and-walkins directed more airstrikes

1990
01:44:38.12 --> 01:44:44.20
around the team. Within 10 to 15 minutes after green years burning HH-3 crashed into the jungle,

1991
01:44:44.76 --> 01:44:50.36
Covey learned that there were two survivors from the Jolly Green Giant and asked ST Alabama

1992
01:44:50.36 --> 01:44:57.32
if they could locate the remaining crew members. Grineer had broken his back, but somehow pulled

1993
01:44:57.32 --> 01:45:04.12
himself from the burning helicopter. The other Jolly Green Giant survivor, Sergeant Ernest Dean Kasbier,

1994
01:45:04.12 --> 01:45:08.84
had been thrown clear of the crash, neither knew the location of the other. Walkins told Black

1995
01:45:08.84 --> 01:45:13.96
where the Air Force survivors were, and that they'd run a daisy chain between his position

1996
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:20.52
and the men, hopefully to clear the area enough for the team to get to both of his survivors. The

1997
01:45:20.52 --> 01:45:26.04
NVA threw one more curve at ST Alabama when Black tried to talk to Covey, he found the primary

1998
01:45:26.04 --> 01:45:34.28
secondary and alternate FM frequencies jammed by the NVA. Frustrated Black smashed the PRC 25 and pulled

1999
01:45:34.28 --> 01:45:40.92
out as URC 10 high frequency survival radio. He was told an arc light strike was being planned

2000
01:45:40.92 --> 01:45:47.64
for this area as soon as possible. By now all air assets, Navy Marine and Air Force, which had

2001
01:45:47.64 --> 01:45:52.44
been scheduled to fly Swords in the North Vietnam, were diverted to the Prairie Fire Emergency

2002
01:45:52.44 --> 01:45:57.64
surrounding ST Alabama. Covey directed numerous air strikes, including more gun and rocket runs

2003
01:45:57.64 --> 01:46:03.08
from helicopter gunships, Scarface and Hughies from the Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 367

2004
01:46:03.08 --> 01:46:09.32
returned to make several runs after refueling and reloading and food by the minute-men

2005
01:46:09.32 --> 01:46:15.80
muskets returned to wreak havoc on the persistent NVA troops. They pounded the jungle area between

2006
01:46:15.80 --> 01:46:24.84
ST Alabama and Air Force survivors. Around 1800, a jolly green pilot, Air Force major, Don Olson

2007
01:46:24.84 --> 01:46:32.44
called over the radio. Blackjack, JG32 over, parked down in the draw, draw in the trees from you.

2008
01:46:32.44 --> 01:46:38.04
You have 20 minutes of fuel before I leave. The first person we must see is an American.

2009
01:46:38.04 --> 01:46:46.84
Hurray, we're taking heavy ground fire. Sheesh. So now it's six o'clock at night. You've been there

2010
01:46:46.84 --> 01:46:51.64
all day on the ground. Four helicopters down. You've got two survivors that you're going to

2011
01:46:51.64 --> 01:46:59.48
try and link up with. And the jolly green just came down to the jungle and hovered in the jungle

2012
01:46:59.48 --> 01:47:05.16
just to just waiting there. Lower his profile and to wait. Yeah, it's a counter-intuitive thing

2013
01:47:05.16 --> 01:47:10.76
that when you're in an aircraft and you're in a helicopter or a plane, when you're up higher,

2014
01:47:10.76 --> 01:47:16.36
it makes you an easier target. It's better to get low where the enemy can't see you.

2015
01:47:16.36 --> 01:47:20.36
So I know it's it might not make sense. People might think, oh, it'd be better to go up,

2016
01:47:20.36 --> 01:47:24.04
but it's actually in a lot of cases better to go down. And that's what this guy's doing.

2017
01:47:27.48 --> 01:47:30.60
Anything that couldn't be carried was thrown over the side of the cliff.

2018
01:47:30.60 --> 01:47:35.32
As quickly as the wounded could move, they headed toward the jolly green giant. Could you guys

2019
01:47:35.32 --> 01:47:39.96
hear the helicopter? Did you know where it was? Yes. So you could hear it and you're like, okay,

2020
01:47:39.96 --> 01:47:46.28
we got to go for it. Yes. The chopper had literally cut away the treetops and branches to

2021
01:47:46.28 --> 01:47:51.24
nestle into the thick, dark green foliage thus reducing its profile to enemy gunners. Also,

2022
01:47:51.24 --> 01:47:54.92
and had to keep the aircraft stable as they were large trees on all sides of the aircraft. The

2023
01:47:54.92 --> 01:47:59.16
trees were large enough that they could severely damage the five rotor blades and cause the

2024
01:47:59.16 --> 01:48:04.52
trapper troper to crash if the any of them got hit. Covey directed more air strikes in a

2025
01:48:04.52 --> 01:48:10.52
daisy chain fashion in the portion of jungle between STE, Alabama and the hovering jolly green

2026
01:48:10.52 --> 01:48:16.20
giant. Walkins hope this would drive out or kill NVA in the zone. Even that task became more

2027
01:48:16.20 --> 01:48:21.56
difficult as smoke from all the ordinance continued to hang over the trees, decreasing the visibility

2028
01:48:21.56 --> 01:48:28.76
for pilots and helicopter gunners. As they move toward the how hovering helicopter, STE, Alabama,

2029
01:48:28.76 --> 01:48:34.28
entered a cool ravine before climbing a final hill to the chopper. There they encountered a

2030
01:48:34.28 --> 01:48:40.20
village with hooches built on 10 foot stilts, complete with large pots cooking rice and vegetables.

2031
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.32
Instead of NVA troops, black found an American taking food from one of the pots, he was the

2032
01:48:47.32 --> 01:48:52.68
flight engineer, Sergeant Ernest Dean Kasbeer, one of the two Air Force survivors from the

2033
01:48:52.68 --> 01:48:58.60
crashed helicopter, soon they found Grenier who assisted in directing the hovering jolly green

2034
01:48:58.60 --> 01:49:03.88
to this area in the jungle despite his broken back. You want to talk about miracles?

2035
01:49:03.88 --> 01:49:09.40
Yeah. Randomly run it into these guys and the village in the village.

2036
01:49:10.60 --> 01:49:17.40
Jeez. But we know we knew it too guys too survival. Yeah, you knew that you had

2037
01:49:17.40 --> 01:49:25.96
to look for. Yeah. LG at the here, the jolly green planet dropped down here at

2038
01:49:25.96 --> 01:49:33.000
Crest. We run from here or the way down here. You know the communist house around here.

2039
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:45.88
We got a difficult time to join with them. So that's why we take you know very crazy decision.

2040
01:49:47.48 --> 01:49:56.12
We go or we go faster or we go slowly or we go you know the by another way to get in

2041
01:49:56.12 --> 01:50:08.84
to join with them. From from from the here to the Crest, it very difficult time of us.

2042
01:50:10.28 --> 01:50:19.88
But we gotta do it. You know like it 18 up low, right, a little bit down. So it's starting to get dark

2043
01:50:19.88 --> 01:50:30.92
and blood and Angle keep on saying hey, we stay here for overnight. But I thought in my mind,

2044
01:50:31.80 --> 01:50:40.04
if I stay overnight, I gotta die because my blitting in the back, everyone is thinking in my body.

2045
01:50:40.04 --> 01:50:53.64
I say let me join first and I run to but we gotta cut to escape from here to the Crest.

2046
01:50:53.64 --> 01:51:08.36
I say go it fight and go and you're gonna to go and this fought thing thing and then I run.

2047
01:51:10.04 --> 01:51:18.04
So you just kind of went for it. Yes. And then they were you trying to get to where the hell

2048
01:51:18.04 --> 01:51:23.08
a copter was and you were just going to go by yourself because otherwise you were going to bleed out.

2049
01:51:23.08 --> 01:51:29.16
Yes. At what point did the rest of the team decide to go with you? Which you made it? They stayed there.

2050
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:41.72
I'm the Pymon to open the like the Broadway to let it, I'm die. It the team got it to be the shape.

2051
01:51:42.92 --> 01:51:50.52
If I run to and then when I get there I gotta shoot by team and a team run.

2052
01:51:50.52 --> 01:51:56.04
Okay, so you're gonna they were covering for you and then when you got there you covered for them. Yes.

2053
01:51:57.88 --> 01:52:05.000
When I run there I say hey I show the chop to there and I stay there I say go.

2054
01:52:05.80 --> 01:52:14.20
When we don't have a radio but when I shot it the people understand I'm safety and then

2055
01:52:14.20 --> 01:52:21.32
quang they got to run to my way we rejoin there with the hell you got to sign.

2056
01:52:23.32 --> 01:52:29.88
We understand if I'm stay overnight I gotta die because they're bleeding. Sure.

2057
01:52:30.92 --> 01:52:39.88
And then anyway I gotta I die let try the try to looking for the way for survival. Right.

2058
01:52:39.88 --> 01:52:47.32
So you you didn't you were either gonna die trying to run there or you're gonna die stay in their overnight.

2059
01:52:47.32 --> 01:52:51.32
Yes. So you might as well eat a way eat a thing I gotta die.

2060
01:52:52.04 --> 01:52:56.92
You know I'm staying there and you already had died what three times four times at this point you're career.

2061
01:52:56.92 --> 01:53:07.08
You know how do we here we still you know understand we training well we training good

2062
01:53:07.08 --> 01:53:16.76
and then we worked together really good if I'm running if quang and black or whatever

2063
01:53:18.12 --> 01:53:22.36
can protect me. They give you cover yeah cover fire. I gotta die in my way.

2064
01:53:23.48 --> 01:53:29.56
And the NBA wasn't used to you guys running. Yes. They didn't expect it. No.

2065
01:53:29.56 --> 01:53:35.80
Again they just before they charged through the rank several times and in this one here he's running

2066
01:53:35.80 --> 01:53:41.48
and then the others followed. Another one didn't think things right there. And you're firing with

2067
01:53:41.48 --> 01:53:48.84
the AK 47's by now. So that way the NBA baby wouldn't be so alert if they heard

2068
01:53:48.84 --> 01:53:53.64
car 15s that would come quickly for the car 15s but hearing AK maybe they weren't sure

2069
01:53:53.64 --> 01:53:58.84
that may have helped us. We still haven't one or two a half 15 really? You know we

2070
01:53:58.84 --> 01:54:07.000
get you know the way the 15 the the form. Yes we put we take it the uniform up the

2071
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:12.12
Ampchik team. Yes we put it in in Capitine. Leave for a child.

2072
01:54:14.52 --> 01:54:20.76
For a different sound. Leave for a child. Okay. Yeah. Leave for a child. So when I saw that

2073
01:54:20.76 --> 01:54:28.92
bad like it they're like a machine gun right by the 15 that the long one they're in. Yes.

2074
01:54:28.92 --> 01:54:38.36
Very small but when we suited by the I don't know how to call it you know the

2075
01:54:38.36 --> 01:54:44.76
form is the it's the flash on the yes. Yes. So it's the different 15. It was about two inches.

2076
01:54:44.76 --> 01:54:51.56
Yeah. They had the early M16. Okay. Three prong. Yes. Yes. We said very early M16 with a three prong.

2077
01:54:51.56 --> 01:54:56.84
They changed the flash. It was time to have a 3 before. It's so different sound. Very different sound.

2078
01:54:56.84 --> 01:55:01.88
Yeah. Very different sound. Yeah. Leave you know the common one more thing that saved you.

2079
01:55:01.88 --> 01:55:07.48
Yeah. One more thing. You're running. You're bleeding and you're firing car 15s but different sound

2080
01:55:07.48 --> 01:55:14.68
along with the AKs and they knew that and then they followed me and then the time I said follow me

2081
01:55:14.68 --> 01:55:23.16
I got big big. You're just single shots. Yeah. If you pull it full automatic you don't have a good enough

2082
01:55:23.16 --> 01:55:32.12
you know the ammo. So the big we count maybe we can play game with them. One, two, three.

2083
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:43.000
Pin one, two, three. Pin, pin. Sometimes. And then they scan it. If you force you know the automatic

2084
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:51.40
it they say hey that's guy. No experience in the walls and amateur. Yes. And easy to run out of the

2085
01:55:51.40 --> 01:56:00.68
ammo. Yeah. Pin. Not pin, pin, pin, pin, pin. Different different way different sound. So they know the

2086
01:56:01.72 --> 01:56:11.48
the people with the enemy. They understand exactly those guys how how they learning. So according

2087
01:56:11.48 --> 01:56:21.32
from the from the training good doing well we're doing good very good. So any situation anywhere

2088
01:56:21.32 --> 01:56:29.88
and anytime training counts. Yes. So just you know just let the people understand it in the army.

2089
01:56:29.88 --> 01:56:38.12
Now you've had a look. You've had a train. Don't be don't say hey I'm hero I'm hero. I'm the big guy.

2090
01:56:38.12 --> 01:56:45.88
No. No. We need to training always training all the way. Learn from each other. If Gemstriy

2091
01:56:47.56 --> 01:56:53.72
he listened to me he said hey how do we get out and that easy right?

2092
01:56:54.68 --> 01:57:02.20
For the chopper. I need an exception. And then we shape the every body. But anyways get back to here

2093
01:57:02.20 --> 01:57:09.72
where you are now. Yes sir. Yeah. Well where we are right now is back to the book the NVA focused

2094
01:57:09.72 --> 01:57:14.68
heavily on the chopper. Easing the pressure on ST Alabama as they near the Jolly Green. Black thought

2095
01:57:14.68 --> 01:57:18.92
it felt like they were moving closer to the gates of hell itself. The NVA were pouring small arms

2096
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:23.48
fire and RPGs at the hovering ship. All the door gunners and pilots intermittently fired the

2097
01:57:23.48 --> 01:57:29.40
mini gun. M79's and M60's and the helicopter gun ships and sky racer skyrators made gun runs around

2098
01:57:29.40 --> 01:57:33.80
it. Time was against them. The weather was beginning to close in. The smoke from previous air

2099
01:57:33.80 --> 01:57:38.04
strikes hung over the area for longer and longer periods of time before clearing enough for the next

2100
01:57:38.04 --> 01:57:44.12
attack from the air. On the ground the manifesti Alabama heard an NVA running through the bushes

2101
01:57:44.12 --> 01:57:48.68
around them. Fortunately the NVA failed to spot the spike team or the Air Force crewman.

2102
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:53.88
Dis desperate. Black had to move his team onto a trail so it could move to the hovering

2103
01:57:53.88 --> 01:57:59.48
helicopter more quickly. As the team moved up the trail the tail gunner was shaking violently

2104
01:57:59.48 --> 01:58:05.72
and had turned a pasty white. Team members set quang down and proceeded to the aircraft.

2105
01:58:05.72 --> 01:58:09.88
At the crest of the hill they saw the helicopter taking hits and dealing out of its own. The M60

2106
01:58:09.88 --> 01:58:13.80
was red hot. Black saw someone firing at M60 and out of one of the windows.

2107
01:58:14.60 --> 01:58:18.92
As Black moved to the chopper the intensity of the gun fire seemed to multiply. The air was so

2108
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:24.36
full of lead he could see it. Few little bits of metal skin fell from the aircraft as they reached

2109
01:58:24.36 --> 01:58:30.04
its underside. The jungle penetrators smashed to the ground next to him and raised three feet

2110
01:58:30.04 --> 01:58:36.28
before he could put three team members on the first load. Grineer the Air Force flight engineer

2111
01:58:36.28 --> 01:58:43.16
and the wounded ST Alabama team member were second were on the second. The wounded Vietnamese

2112
01:58:43.16 --> 01:58:48.68
became entangled in jungle vines and while he was being hoisted upward the Air Force

2113
01:58:48.68 --> 01:58:53.72
the operator had to stop the hoist lower it and give him enough time to untangle himself.

2114
01:58:54.76 --> 01:58:59.08
When the hoist moved up toward the aircraft the Vietnamese was not sitting in the seat but hanging

2115
01:58:59.08 --> 01:59:07.32
on with assistance from Air Force Sergeant Kasbir despite the NVA gunfire black ran back to the

2116
01:59:07.32 --> 01:59:12.76
bamboo thicket where he had left the remainder of the team. Quang the dying tail gunner pointed

2117
01:59:12.76 --> 01:59:22.68
his 45 caliber pistol at the advancing NVA and said toy kit I die. He motioned Black to return

2118
01:59:22.68 --> 01:59:30.84
to the helicopter before shooting himself. Black was running back to the ship when two NVA

2119
01:59:30.84 --> 01:59:36.92
stepped onto the trail and pointed their AK-47s at him. Two holy one of the soldiers shouted

2120
01:59:36.92 --> 01:59:44.12
Black stretched out his arms and continued walking towards them. When he was only a few feet away

2121
01:59:44.12 --> 01:59:50.36
he said two holy. The young NVA soldiers appeared surprised before they could react black grabbed the

2122
01:59:50.36 --> 01:59:55.96
AK-47s by their searing barrels and stripped them from their soldiers. He backhanded the soldier

2123
01:59:55.96 --> 02:00:00.36
on his right and smashed the other soldier in the face with one of the weapons. He left the stun

2124
02:00:00.36 --> 02:00:04.92
soldiers lying there as he sprinted the chopper where he found the praying one-one. The rest of the

2125
02:00:04.92 --> 02:00:09.32
team was on board firing any weapon they could get their hands on. As the jungle penetrated

2126
02:00:09.32 --> 02:00:14.84
lift black and the one-one upward they were shoured with hot spent casings from the M60 and other

2127
02:00:14.84 --> 02:00:21.16
weapons being fired from inside the aircraft. The entire team fired out the windows and from the

2128
02:00:21.16 --> 02:00:28.36
back door as the overloaded helicopter began to lift out of the jungle. Major Olson told Kovie

2129
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:34.20
he was at maximum power. As the jolly green giant slowly rose, Black felt the ship making

2130
02:00:34.20 --> 02:00:39.88
upward surges from B-40 rocket slamming into the armor plate and underside of the aircraft.

2131
02:00:39.88 --> 02:00:44.68
It felt like it was a giant, it felt like a giant slugging the ship in the stomach, boosting it

2132
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:50.76
upward with each rocket blast. From his view above the fray, rockets couldn't believe the bird

2133
02:00:50.76 --> 02:00:57.48
kept flying. Somehow the pilot got the jolly green giant out of there. Once clear of a jungle

2134
02:00:57.48 --> 02:01:03.64
hole the ship began its ascend out of the valley and the shadow of death. The door gunner removed

2135
02:01:03.64 --> 02:01:09.16
his helmet and placed it on Black's head. The pilot told him we're on our way home.

2136
02:01:10.60 --> 02:01:15.08
Not quite. From above, walk and saw the crippled ship catch fire and try to make

2137
02:01:15.80 --> 02:01:21.000
and try to make it out of the killing zone. It crossed two ridge lines before descending into a clearing

2138
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.52
where it crashed landed. Olson had gotten them out of the killing zone but JG32 had flown its

2139
02:01:26.52 --> 02:01:31.16
last rescue mission. Everyone except Black and the one-one were transferred to another jolly green

2140
02:01:31.16 --> 02:01:36.28
giant piloted by a Coast Guard Exchange pilot, Lieutenant Commander Lonnie Nixon.

2141
02:01:36.28 --> 02:01:45.96
Nixon took over 30 hits picking up ST Alabama and others. After everyone, after everyone knew

2142
02:01:45.96 --> 02:01:51.48
that Black, the remaining personnel from ST Alabama and the Air Force survivors from JG10 were

2143
02:01:51.48 --> 02:01:55.64
cleared from the original target area. They hammered it with everything they had, including more

2144
02:01:55.64 --> 02:02:02.76
napalm bombs and gun runs. Captain Hortonus, the pilot of Watkins' FAC plane was so mad at

2145
02:02:03.48 --> 02:02:09.80
that he flew the O2 down into small arms range and fired his 2.7 millimeter rockets into the

2146
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:17.24
area where the NVA had knocked down JG10. He and Watkins took a hit to the front and the engine died.

2147
02:02:17.24 --> 02:02:23.08
Hortonus somehow got the Skymaster O2 up out of the area and back to FOOBIE. There was no engine

2148
02:02:23.08 --> 02:02:32.44
pressure when he landed. A co-bregun ship landed and opened the Armament Compartment doors which

2149
02:02:32.44 --> 02:02:37.64
had seat belts attached to them. Black and the one-one buckled up and were soon airborne alongside

2150
02:02:37.64 --> 02:02:43.32
the groat jolly green giant returning to Dane. They are flying so fast that Black had to turn

2151
02:02:43.32 --> 02:02:48.36
his bloodstained face away in order to breathe. Within minutes he was so cold he was shivering

2152
02:02:48.36 --> 02:02:53.96
uncontrollably. The co-brelended at a marine medivax site where the Americans were wrapped in

2153
02:02:53.96 --> 02:03:00.92
poncho liners and helicopter to Dane. At the Dane and Firmary, everyone was getting patched up.

2154
02:03:02.04 --> 02:03:06.44
When foe saw Black, he raised his right hand and a fist above his head.

2155
02:03:06.44 --> 02:03:18.68
Tohoi Duma. He yelled surrender mother fuckers. Man that's a crazy mission.

2156
02:03:20.76 --> 02:03:26.36
What do you think just another Dane saw? Absolutely. Maybe just a little bit just a

2157
02:03:26.36 --> 02:03:40.68
little bit. That was your life. That's what you did every day or multiple times a month

2158
02:03:41.48 --> 02:03:53.32
over and over and over again. The casualty rate for SOG was over 100%.

2159
02:03:53.32 --> 02:03:58.36
Correct. So if you were going to SOG, you were going to get wounded probably more than once.

2160
02:03:59.40 --> 02:04:06.76
You may be killed obviously. I can't imagine that the survival rate for the Vietnamese that

2161
02:04:06.76 --> 02:04:14.44
aren't going back to America. You're just staying in that job for years. I mean, the survival rate

2162
02:04:14.44 --> 02:04:21.08
must have been minuscule for you to be standing here as crazy. Absolutely. It's a miracle.

2163
02:04:21.08 --> 02:04:29.56
Actually, in our situation, we have no choice. We have no choice. We have to go forward.

2164
02:04:32.20 --> 02:04:42.04
Vietnam, Vietnam, it situation in Vietnam war country. If I'm not joined to the army,

2165
02:04:42.92 --> 02:04:49.16
I get back home. I cannot survival. I must go with the, I'm not even in the

2166
02:04:49.16 --> 02:05:04.60
infantry or local army. Why not we stay with the SOG? We got a lot of upfouring. We got a lot

2167
02:05:04.60 --> 02:05:15.64
of money. Better pay. Yeah, we got a lot of power when we go back to town. We were, we were

2168
02:05:15.64 --> 02:05:26.28
at an NVAA uniform. Nobody can touch it because we have it. The car.

2169
02:05:27.64 --> 02:05:37.64
Ampesty of the OS government. Nobody can touch whatever they want to touch. We got an MP,

2170
02:05:37.64 --> 02:05:46.28
military police there to protect us. And we got a gun in the throne. We got a gun pistol in the

2171
02:05:46.28 --> 02:05:55.72
bike. Come on. Whatever tank guy, I already got. Have you watched it in a rainbow movie or something?

2172
02:05:56.52 --> 02:06:04.76
We did like 100% like him. We got a clay momma in here. We got to go somewhere.

2173
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:12.60
Yeah, we pull over here. Nobody know anything else. Walk around the clay momma in on your chest.

2174
02:06:12.60 --> 02:06:21.24
Yeah, yeah. You want to play? Go ahead. Come on, please. Even going to the police station.

2175
02:06:22.36 --> 02:06:29.40
Whatever they want to do with us, we joined together with one team, three American and

2176
02:06:29.40 --> 02:06:37.08
nine Vietnamese. We went together. Nobody can't stop us. At the time the Quang was in jail.

2177
02:06:37.08 --> 02:06:42.20
You had to go get him out of jail. Yeah. Had to break him out of jail. Your Quang got in jail.

2178
02:06:42.20 --> 02:06:46.76
Did it? Was it was the resistance from the jail or did they just let you guys take him?

2179
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:52.84
When they realized who you guys were? No, we went there for free. Nobody can stop here.

2180
02:06:52.84 --> 02:06:59.72
We ran there. Open there. Clay mormors on your chest. Come on here, please.

2181
02:06:59.72 --> 02:07:01.80
And also had a couple of guys who didn't have 60s.

2182
02:07:02.84 --> 02:07:09.24
Come on 15, Leia, Hong Kai, they're looking 15. What the hell did you get in there?

2183
02:07:09.24 --> 02:07:19.08
Right? Yeah. Nobody know. We got a K-47. If they shoot a clay momma, he got to blow out.

2184
02:07:19.08 --> 02:07:26.60
Yeah. Chow. Kwon got out of jail. Kwon got out of jail. He got to get out of jail.

2185
02:07:26.60 --> 02:07:30.92
Clay mormors. So he could go on a mission on October 5th. And that's where he died.

2186
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:34.12
Yeah. That's that Kwon. So that's when you had to break him out.

2187
02:07:34.12 --> 02:07:37.16
It was before this mission. Before this mission, they broke him out of jail.

2188
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:46.28
She's so basically run down. So basically you were in that job because you guys were the

2189
02:07:46.28 --> 02:07:49.64
baddest motherfuckers in Vietnam and you did whatever you wanted to.

2190
02:07:50.68 --> 02:08:00.36
Just sure. Even to strong guys. Hey Clay mormors beats a strong guy. All day.

2191
02:08:01.40 --> 02:08:07.64
You know, I can count the piece up the the inside. 555 piece.

2192
02:08:08.52 --> 02:08:12.28
Ball bearings. I can't count.

2193
02:08:12.28 --> 02:08:20.52
So sometimes we play just play the game. Right. Pull it down with she far inside.

2194
02:08:21.32 --> 02:08:25.72
We took out the we took out the she far. Yes. I thought they take it out and cook the coffee

2195
02:08:25.72 --> 02:08:31.40
stuff. Oh yeah. And then we put it in here. Nobody knows. That the real one or the fact.

2196
02:08:31.40 --> 02:08:34.92
This is still science. Yeah. It's good good psychological operations.

2197
02:08:36.52 --> 02:08:40.68
When did you uh, because I know you ended up getting wounded badly in your leg.

2198
02:08:40.68 --> 02:08:47.40
When did that happen? It happened all the story. Yes. 1971.

2199
02:08:48.52 --> 02:08:54.68
And then what happened did you get shot? I guess so. And how did you get out of the,

2200
02:08:54.68 --> 02:09:01.96
how did you escape the situation? We don't know underground, but the water in there,

2201
02:09:01.96 --> 02:09:12.12
squam in there. And then we get out of, we're looking for with the people asperium like

2202
02:09:12.12 --> 02:09:20.04
me. We're looking for the either place and under the tree to stay there. And they want to,

2203
02:09:20.04 --> 02:09:25.24
they want to, uh, me to be be out of the room. I mean, they want to catch the team.

2204
02:09:25.24 --> 02:09:34.68
They, the first thing they want, the first thing like it, they want a shock like it.

2205
02:09:34.68 --> 02:09:40.84
Yeah. You're a smearer. I'll tell you to get a pill. They want to, yeah. They want me to do it.

2206
02:09:41.56 --> 02:09:50.44
They want me to, they want, they want to catch me. But we, we, we want to not let them do it.

2207
02:09:50.44 --> 02:09:57.88
And, but after that, they want, but they want to catch the team. They don't want to kill the

2208
02:09:57.88 --> 02:10:06.92
team. Okay. They say surrender like a chihuahua. And then we answered the, uh, by the

2209
02:10:06.92 --> 02:10:15.16
conference in here, the chancho, but they very close to us. They got a bunco around there.

2210
02:10:15.16 --> 02:10:22.36
And then they should, they got a good radio before they want to test the team. They got a

2211
02:10:22.36 --> 02:10:30.60
cute, the radio man first. Okay. Like it's the French man. He got the radio. They want to

2212
02:10:30.60 --> 02:10:38.84
make the contact with the team. They got a cute, the radio man first. And then my

2213
02:10:38.84 --> 02:10:48.76
like it, like to the radio. I put, I kicked the radio out. But they should, they're ready to

2214
02:10:49.80 --> 02:10:57.08
including my leg. Oh. And maybe two, three down into my leg, they should by RPD.

2215
02:10:58.04 --> 02:11:04.20
I get the chancho I know that. Sure. And then I pull out my leg.

2216
02:11:04.20 --> 02:11:12.28
That time we just get out there for 10 minutes. And team, I just report to

2217
02:11:13.56 --> 02:11:21.24
the Bingham Bingham, just report to the Kovie, say, team safety, team okay. And they can go home.

2218
02:11:21.24 --> 02:11:24.44
Bingham was the team leader. Yes. Yeah. They can go home.

2219
02:11:24.44 --> 02:11:31.16
Say them and say them Bingham. Yes. And then later on, they got a hit,

2220
02:11:31.16 --> 02:11:38.60
right away. And my friend, they carried me out, they called back, they called back to the

2221
02:11:38.60 --> 02:11:49.96
chopper, just chopper, come back. But you know, I got it, PFC 68. Oh, later on.

2222
02:11:49.96 --> 02:11:59.40
No, PRC 68, the radio. The emergency radio. The PRC 68. That was still around when I came

2223
02:11:59.40 --> 02:12:04.76
in till really. Yeah. It was getting phased out. It can replace by the PRC 125. But there was like

2224
02:12:04.76 --> 02:12:08.36
one or two of them that you could look at the radio. Yeah. That's a small one.

2225
02:12:08.36 --> 02:12:12.68
What's one we got at the York 10? Yeah. Yeah. We got to

2226
02:12:12.68 --> 02:12:17.56
go 10. Octangoo can up top. But PRC 68, we can

2227
02:12:17.56 --> 02:12:26.60
change the frequency to top. Oh. Okay. That they got to develop the new thing. And then when I turn it on,

2228
02:12:26.60 --> 02:12:34.12
you know, when I pull out the, they got to try to be pull me to the Aussie. And then I pull it on.

2229
02:12:34.12 --> 02:12:42.04
And then the, the, uh, chopper coming back and stood up to the enemy. And I turn over.

2230
02:12:42.04 --> 02:12:52.28
My leg, it really hurts really pain. I throw my, uh, PFC 68 away. I'm dropped somewhere.

2231
02:12:52.28 --> 02:13:02.28
And then they thought, I'm dead. We can up to 10 minutes. I cannot, you know, turn off the

2232
02:13:02.28 --> 02:13:12.12
PRC 20. That means I am the one dead. And they want to kill. They want to blow out the PRC 68.

2233
02:13:12.12 --> 02:13:20.12
They don't want to be PRC 68. To do the enemy. And that's why I should

2234
02:13:20.12 --> 02:13:29.64
go. And they should route us by the rocket by the mission on Codding and the NVA thought,

2235
02:13:32.36 --> 02:13:39.40
you know, like at the, the chopper know where they are. They move out. They, they, they were scared.

2236
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:45.56
They scan it, they move it out. And I'm free. I'm not free, but you know, I got to safety

2237
02:13:45.56 --> 02:13:53.40
decision. And the chopper went down, picked me up. And the foot chopper went down.

2238
02:13:54.76 --> 02:14:02.20
I smelled the gas. Because the enemy should up to chopper to the gas tank.

2239
02:14:03.32 --> 02:14:09.64
I say get out of the way. I, I cannot shoot because I shoot at the, the chopper that

2240
02:14:09.64 --> 02:14:17.24
I've got to burn it out. Yes. And I wait my hand. I say go, go, go, go, go, go. And I talk to

2241
02:14:17.24 --> 02:14:22.92
hold the team. I say don't shoot anything. Don't shoot anything. And after that, you know, the,

2242
02:14:22.92 --> 02:14:29.72
the pilot, they knew, you know, the gas and spread out. And they let, I don't know what,

2243
02:14:29.72 --> 02:14:36.60
and what happened with the chopper. But the second and then now, pick me up. They take me to the,

2244
02:14:36.60 --> 02:14:47.000
now, not if you patch it up. And then later on the day, I got inspection. And then Dr.

2245
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:58.68
cut up my leg. So only 20 minutes on the ground. Only 20 minutes when we land out.

2246
02:14:58.68 --> 02:15:11.88
But I'm okay now. I'm back. So then what was it like as the war was over in America? It was

2247
02:15:11.88 --> 02:15:19.08
leaving in the communist or taking over. I mean, you had to be kind of a marked man being this

2248
02:15:19.08 --> 02:15:24.12
former, you know, special operations guy that was working alongside the Americans. They must have

2249
02:15:24.12 --> 02:15:34.36
won't define you. That's why I told you that we need to training. Up to, I got to go in it.

2250
02:15:35.40 --> 02:15:42.44
I watched him to work with the American embassy. Okay. So after you got willing,

2251
02:15:42.44 --> 02:15:47.08
did you want to work at the American embassy? Yes, got it. My station in the now,

2252
02:15:47.08 --> 02:16:03.64
that 52, but then US, can't select general one in the now. Until 1975, the day we lost the

2253
02:16:03.64 --> 02:16:19.80
long, it, the end of the march in 1975, which my experience with the show, we understand

2254
02:16:19.80 --> 02:16:34.68
enemy situation. They fight from not to the show. But I work in the land and at the time, you know, the,

2255
02:16:34.68 --> 02:16:43.000
take it the land. I'm a worked the show. I hit a lot of enemy. I contact a lot of, you know,

2256
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:51.64
like the security or police. What are you thinking? They move. They attack from the north to the

2257
02:16:51.64 --> 02:16:58.92
south. But I'm from the south, move up to the north. They thought I'm, I'm there, they're friend.

2258
02:17:00.52 --> 02:17:06.76
That's why I'm told you, we need to train. So you did the opposite of what they thought you would do.

2259
02:17:06.76 --> 02:17:10.92
Yes. You went from the south to the north to the north. Then being,

2260
02:17:10.92 --> 02:17:18.84
I'm the people from the north. They're not pay attention about the people from the south to the north.

2261
02:17:20.36 --> 02:17:27.80
But if you move from the north to the south, they have a checkpoint. Where you go,

2262
02:17:28.60 --> 02:17:33.88
where are you going? Where do you go? Everything to the west, the question, but I'm from the north,

2263
02:17:33.88 --> 02:17:43.80
from the south to the north. The reason that my father-in-law, up the way of the Foubaikem,

2264
02:17:45.08 --> 02:17:57.000
and then we stayed there until they took over the side gone. We almost crazy. We don't know

2265
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.44
where to go. We don't understand situation, but my family in the Sagan and Dalat,

2266
02:18:05.80 --> 02:18:19.32
and in Benhor, and up to the south yet now, you know, I use it. Enemy paper work.

2267
02:18:19.32 --> 02:18:29.000
I mean, I decir an enemy certificate from the north. By the way,

2268
02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:38.84
my relip, my uncle, my something relip, my nephew, up the north,

2269
02:18:40.28 --> 02:18:47.72
going to the south to see me. When the first thing we night in 54,

2270
02:18:47.72 --> 02:18:54.28
we still have the people living in either north. When they came down, they looked in for us,

2271
02:18:55.16 --> 02:19:00.44
because between Sagan and North Vietnam, it's very difficult. Very difficult.

2272
02:19:01.80 --> 02:19:09.16
Sagan, it's rich people. And, you know, no like people, but in North Vietnam,

2273
02:19:09.16 --> 02:19:19.32
they only, you know, know like by the combination. They limit it with education.

2274
02:19:20.52 --> 02:19:29.40
So when they came down to the south to see our family, they don't have nothing, but they still say,

2275
02:19:30.28 --> 02:19:35.24
we got a TV over the town, we got a whole got a thing, but they have nothing.

2276
02:19:35.24 --> 02:19:42.84
But at the time, they asked for the money, they asked for the gold, they asked for the drink.

2277
02:19:43.64 --> 02:19:53.96
That's why I learned from them too. So, I'm not just a only one place. Today, I'm in San Jose tomorrow.

2278
02:19:53.96 --> 02:20:01.56
I'm not a law-gencer. Law-gencer, let's, I got a gold energy. And then I got to go,

2279
02:20:01.56 --> 02:20:07.08
watch in Tandisi, I got to go, you gotta keep moving. Keep the communist guessing.

2280
02:20:07.08 --> 02:20:17.40
Yes. And then I buy something, everything in the communist situation, government, everything

2281
02:20:17.40 --> 02:20:31.64
it, not free. Like I want to, I want to feast. I gotta go down to see the Nang or somewhere,

2282
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:40.52
I buy the feast. I took from there, back to San Juan, to sell the supermarket. So I found out

2283
02:20:40.52 --> 02:20:49.80
the way, by the way, I'm looking for the way to Escap from Vietnam. They give me some time of

2284
02:20:49.80 --> 02:21:00.36
free because they know they knew I was from the shopman, at O. Z for free, the envires,

2285
02:21:00.36 --> 02:21:04.92
because they got a gun, but they don't know how to do. So they actually invited you,

2286
02:21:04.92 --> 02:21:11.64
the communist invited you to. No, the people in the Shao Vietnam. Oh, South Vietnam. They invited

2287
02:21:11.64 --> 02:21:19.32
you to start training them? No. To just do security for them, to do what? To if we

2288
02:21:19.32 --> 02:21:36.36
see anything happened in O. Z, I got to shortly come and it just got it. Then I brought back them. And then

2289
02:21:36.36 --> 02:21:45.000
until 1986, October, I should say to come to Malaysia. And how did you do that?

2290
02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:54.04
My small boat. Yes. And you tried 14 times before the last time I did 15 times.

2291
02:21:56.04 --> 02:22:00.84
And what is that? You tried to escape. So you tried to escape 14 times. You were successful

2292
02:22:00.84 --> 02:22:05.48
on your 15th time. What were the other methods that you tried to do? Was it always by boat?

2293
02:22:06.04 --> 02:22:13.08
By boat. Always by boat. I got to go, I can go by kitchen.

2294
02:22:13.08 --> 02:22:25.88
What ever the lounge with my leg? Because I know where the way to go. Right. I know where the way to go.

2295
02:22:25.88 --> 02:22:32.76
But my leg. Go west but you couldn't walk. And then what happened when you got to Malaysia?

2296
02:22:32.76 --> 02:22:53.88
I be there for wave for the UN. I stayed there. I see the American delegation. And they come to

2297
02:22:53.88 --> 02:23:07.16
interview me. And then they take me to the UN at stake. How did they go? How do they confirm

2298
02:23:07.16 --> 02:23:16.12
who you are? I have nothing but they got a special interview from the people from the US.

2299
02:23:16.12 --> 02:23:25.88
I mean GVI, I mean Joy-Poor and the ETH. When I came there I have nothing. But they asked me.

2300
02:23:27.24 --> 02:23:35.64
And I taught my history. They called back here. They called back step to check up.

2301
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:43.40
Right. And after one man they say, hey, you come to US. So they did that pretty fast.

2302
02:23:43.40 --> 02:23:54.92
Yes. Because they asked me. They got a group looking for the beer. Whatever MIA. The

2303
02:23:54.92 --> 02:24:03.08
asked me the question do I know any American mission in action or as I said, yes. I did. I taught

2304
02:24:03.08 --> 02:24:13.08
them. Poking. Came crying. Jim Schrey. These are all people on our teens who got killed.

2305
02:24:13.08 --> 02:24:16.92
They got kind of two of their Americans on Alaska when they got wiped out when Jim went

2306
02:24:16.92 --> 02:24:23.16
Allen survived. The two Americans were crying in King. I only remember with three.

2307
02:24:24.12 --> 02:24:29.16
But they asked me, do you know where the location I said? Yes, I did.

2308
02:24:29.16 --> 02:24:38.04
Sure. And they tried to bring me back to the Vietnam to tell them. But they could.

2309
02:24:38.04 --> 02:24:45.88
Because at the time I stayed there for a segment for waiting to come back to Vietnam.

2310
02:24:47.64 --> 02:24:54.60
But I don't know why they sent me to the Philippines for education training.

2311
02:24:54.60 --> 02:25:02.04
I think what kind of education training learning, you know, like for orientation, for how

2312
02:25:02.04 --> 02:25:10.28
the American life and the Indian for Sigmund came over here saying something.

2313
02:25:12.04 --> 02:25:14.12
And then what was it like when you landed in San Francisco?

2314
02:25:15.56 --> 02:25:21.72
1988 something. 1988? Yes. What did you do when you landed? Did you have any family here?

2315
02:25:21.72 --> 02:25:32.60
Yes, I got my sister in San Jose and had she escaped from Vietnam already? Yes, 1975.

2316
02:25:32.60 --> 02:25:42.84
And how did she escape? Because she got a husband like the Vietnamese pilot.

2317
02:25:42.84 --> 02:25:54.44
And the out of Vietnam by the way, you know, the hushman. Wow. So what did you do when you landed?

2318
02:25:54.44 --> 02:26:00.60
Just have to start get a job and I mean you couldn't strap a claymord of your chest anymore and walk around town.

2319
02:26:00.60 --> 02:26:11.24
Taking what you wanted. My sister, she'd be here to get the 75.

2320
02:26:11.24 --> 02:26:23.08
And then she got a few rest days and five guests days. And she was a sail, a co.

2321
02:26:25.08 --> 02:26:29.88
When I came, I went for her. Like a family job.

2322
02:26:31.64 --> 02:26:38.52
Until I got, you know, like a, I got stroke 15 years ago.

2323
02:26:38.52 --> 02:26:47.16
Yeah, 15 years, 17 years ago. I got stroke. And then there's no more, no more job. No more work.

2324
02:26:48.44 --> 02:26:54.44
Yeah, and I happened. We all thought cowboy Finney will never see cowboy game. We all heard that.

2325
02:26:54.44 --> 02:26:58.84
I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think they can kill cowboy at this point.

2326
02:26:58.84 --> 02:27:04.60
Cowboys got a liver ever. So he has a stroke or a bad stroke. But yeah, he's back. My mouth.

2327
02:27:04.60 --> 02:27:13.000
I don't know. I was a whole year and I cannot move. But now I'm still okay. But another trouble.

2328
02:27:15.16 --> 02:27:24.20
A lot of age and orange. A lot of age and orange. I got a kidney from, I got a dialysis.

2329
02:27:26.12 --> 02:27:31.24
Now at home. And you managed somehow to have kids during all this.

2330
02:27:31.24 --> 02:27:36.04
You have children. Yes, I do. And how many children do you have?

2331
02:27:36.04 --> 02:27:38.68
Totally a 10.

2332
02:27:38.68 --> 02:27:44.20
Do you believe it? I don't, I believe anything that you tell me.

2333
02:27:44.20 --> 02:27:49.16
Three, three, that in the Vietnam. Okay. So you lost three kids in Vietnam.

2334
02:27:49.16 --> 02:27:55.56
We don't, when the newborn, they don't have it, you know, any food. They don't have any, yeah.

2335
02:27:55.56 --> 02:28:07.64
I can energy to stay. I treat that. And then when I ask him, with the two of my son,

2336
02:28:07.64 --> 02:28:12.52
came over here with me. My wife at the time, it's still like in the Vietnam.

2337
02:28:14.60 --> 02:28:24.04
And then I do my paperwork. Home my family here right now. I got fashion and two girls in here with me.

2338
02:28:24.04 --> 02:28:27.64
In the United States, me, me. Oh, beautiful. One of the, uh,

2339
02:28:27.64 --> 02:28:38.28

2340
02:28:38.28 --> 02:28:46.60

2341
02:28:48.12 --> 02:28:53.88
no, 11 wrong child. 11 grandchildren. Yes. Wow.

2342
02:28:53.88 --> 02:29:01.16
11 little cowboys out there. 11 little cowboys. So you are going to live forever. No doubt.

2343
02:29:01.16 --> 02:29:10.12
No doubt. I try my best. I can not tell. Whatever, you know, like it, when I got shot,

2344
02:29:11.56 --> 02:29:18.36
my, my wife say, co-nive and one that's saying, hey, don't do it. And then my son say,

2345
02:29:18.36 --> 02:29:25.64
co-nive one, when I say, don't do it. I mean, stay. I cannot sit. I cannot love now.

2346
02:29:25.64 --> 02:29:29.48
This is when you had your stroke. Yes. You said don't call 911. Yeah. No.

2347
02:29:31.96 --> 02:29:36.28
You didn't want to call a prairie fire emergency on that situation. No, I called chopper.

2348
02:29:36.28 --> 02:29:43.80
Cocking me. And I, you know, I, who, I, because I have a training when, when I, what

2349
02:29:43.80 --> 02:29:51.08
job, I have a training kung fu. I got a training, training yoga. Mm-hmm. And I keep,

2350
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:58.52
you know, I keep my body, you know, free. I keep my mind going. And later about our,

2351
02:29:58.52 --> 02:30:05.72
I back to normal, not normal. That time, you know, we cannot, we can, we can use it, you know,

2352
02:30:05.72 --> 02:30:13.08
medication. I say, okay, now, co- 911, take me to the doctor. But the time of

2353
02:30:13.08 --> 02:30:20.68
our emergency, I learned from my father. He crying when I lost my leg. He said,

2354
02:30:20.68 --> 02:30:29.80
he told me why I'm not using the hook. You know, hope, right? Hope, hope,

2355
02:30:29.80 --> 02:30:34.04
hope, medication. Hope is the medication. Yes. Not, you know,

2356
02:30:34.04 --> 02:30:39.000
use it by the American way, you made a case and they could take people, I'll get shot.

2357
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:46.76
Then, no good. So that's why I am, say, don't call 911. Well, and then I,

2358
02:30:47.32 --> 02:30:54.84
survival right now, you see it? I got a lot of trouble. I know, it affected by the war.

2359
02:30:56.84 --> 02:31:05.56
You know, sometimes it make me depressed. I got a lot of medication. And, you know,

2360
02:31:05.56 --> 02:31:16.60
they spread everything in the Vietnam. H and orange, we came down there. You know that

2361
02:31:16.60 --> 02:31:24.52
we were a salt with the water. But we put out the rock, the water in there, we taken out

2362
02:31:24.52 --> 02:31:34.20
drink. That's why I got a trauma with my ACE right now. Because the age and orange,

2363
02:31:34.20 --> 02:31:43.88
just, well, I'll tell you what. I don't know. We've been going for two and a half hours.

2364
02:31:43.88 --> 02:31:49.64
No, till what do we miss? What do we, did I miss anything? Well, the only thing we miss would be,

2365
02:31:49.64 --> 02:31:56.20
if we, if you want to talk about the day he was with the Frenchman, that his story

2366
02:31:56.20 --> 02:32:01.08
day when a Frenchman got shot in the back for a time. Yeah. If you remember that. Okay. So,

2367
02:32:01.08 --> 02:32:06.12
one month later, you guys are on another mission. And I'm going, I'm going back into across the fence.

2368
02:32:07.32 --> 02:32:11.16
Here we go. Later in the afternoon, children signal to the team to pull their claim

2369
02:32:11.16 --> 02:32:16.20
or minds and prepare to move out. Due to the combined weight of the rock sack and web gear,

2370
02:32:16.20 --> 02:32:21.48
let's turn it off. This is the Frenchman. Move to his knees and slung his rock sack on his back.

2371
02:32:21.48 --> 02:32:27.80
Just as it landed on his back, AK-47's open fire. Let's turn it off with slam to the ground, face

2372
02:32:27.80 --> 02:32:33.000
first, face first. The impact so severe he had fought he had broken his nose. Startled.

2373
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.36
L'Aternot jumped up with his car 15 pointing it toward the AK-47 gunfire that was near the front of

2374
02:32:38.36 --> 02:32:43.08
the team. Surprised that there were no NVA near him. L'Aternot removed the rock sack to discover that

2375
02:32:43.08 --> 02:32:51.64
four AK-47 rounds had ripped through the 23-pound PRC 25. He reached into an especially tailored

2376
02:32:51.64 --> 02:32:56.44
pocket on his fatigue shirt, which was sewn with vertical zippers, one of the left of his shirt,

2377
02:32:56.44 --> 02:33:00.12
one of the right side, between the top and bottom of the pockets on his shirt and pulled out

2378
02:33:00.12 --> 02:33:07.16
his URC 10 emergency radio and broadcast a general alert for any aircraft in the area.

2379
02:33:07.16 --> 02:33:13.16
ST Virginia was declaring a prairie fire emergency. Then there was a sudden complete silence.

2380
02:33:13.16 --> 02:33:20.44
Eerie silent. Amazed at the quietude, L'Aternot walked to children's who asked him

2381
02:33:20.44 --> 02:33:24.52
what he had done with the PRC 25. L'Aternot explained that four rounds had ripped through the radio

2382
02:33:24.52 --> 02:33:28.84
and that it was probably useless. Get the fucking radio children's yelled. What if it's working?

2383
02:33:28.84 --> 02:33:33.80
We leave it behind for those assholes to use. Stond L'Aternot went back picked up the rocksack and

2384
02:33:33.80 --> 02:33:38.60
walked to children's who grabbed the hand said as NVA troops began firing to ask Team Virginia.

2385
02:33:38.60 --> 02:33:43.40
And yelled into the radio. We have a fucking prairie fire emergency. Get us the fuck out of here

2386
02:33:43.40 --> 02:33:48.68
or our promise will kick your ass all the way back to Saigon. As the firefight raged on,

2387
02:33:48.68 --> 02:33:52.84
the remainder of the team was lying down on the ground that they firing at the NVA

2388
02:33:52.84 --> 02:33:56.92
white children. While children's in the L'Aternot continued to argue while standing up oblivious to

2389
02:33:56.92 --> 02:34:01.88
the AK-47 rounds cracking over their heads. L'Aternot yelled back at children's. It won't work.

2390
02:34:01.88 --> 02:34:08.68
While pointing the PRC 25 radio where the antenna had been shot off. No antenna, no commo.

2391
02:34:08.68 --> 02:34:12.92
L'Aternot grabbed a spare whip and ten and handed to children who screwed into the radio.

2392
02:34:12.92 --> 02:34:17.56
This time children screamed into the radio. We need an ex-film now. I'm declaring a prairie fire

2393
02:34:17.56 --> 02:34:23.40
emergency. Is anyone out there? Within a second or two, there was a response. Calm down

2394
02:34:23.40 --> 02:34:31.48
children's. I realized your under fire set a cover rider. Just at that moment, several AK-47's

2395
02:34:31.48 --> 02:34:38.04
opened fire from the woodline near the log where L'Aternot had been unceremoniously slammed onto his face.

2396
02:34:38.04 --> 02:34:43.96
L'Aternot and Cowboy returned fire. Cover your rider continued. We heard your team declare a prairie

2397
02:34:43.96 --> 02:34:49.24
prairie fire emergency on guard frequency and I've rallied the cavalry. What's your mark? Do you

2398
02:34:49.24 --> 02:34:54.60
have an LZ insight? Before children set a word into the radio, he turned to L'Aternot and said,

2399
02:34:54.60 --> 02:35:01.000
see, it works. Suppose we had left it for the NVA. Never. I say again, never, ever leave behind a

2400
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:07.24
radio. As if to emphasize that point, the NVA opened fire again as L'April began looking for an

2401
02:35:07.24 --> 02:35:14.76
LZ while moving the team down the hill away from the most concentrated NVA gunfire. Cunning L'Aternot

2402
02:35:14.76 --> 02:35:20.12
knows Slack, children's road, tell Covey will give him five, will give him a fix in five minutes.

2403
02:35:20.12 --> 02:35:23.88
We'll probably need strings to get out of here. I doubt we can make it down to the valley where

2404
02:35:23.88 --> 02:35:29.32
a king be can pick us up. Without missing a beat, L'Aternot, who for the first time felt four burning

2405
02:35:29.32 --> 02:35:34.84
stings in his back repeated those words to Covey while he and Cowboy began providing cover fire

2406
02:35:34.84 --> 02:35:40.52
as the tail element of the team. L'Aternot then L'Aternot nodded to Cowboy, who ignited several

2407
02:35:40.52 --> 02:35:45.56
claymore minds at the team and set out on its perimeter. Those minds only slowed the NVA for a few

2408
02:35:45.56 --> 02:35:51.64
seconds before the dust and debris from the blasts had settled, NVA soldiers were moving through it

2409
02:35:51.64 --> 02:35:56.76
toward Cowboy and L'Aternot. Without saying a word, the two men took turns firing at the

2410
02:35:56.76 --> 02:36:02.44
enemy while moving downhill, rotating E around each other, Cowboy would fire several bursts from

2411
02:36:02.44 --> 02:36:07.48
his car 15 and then reload as he reloaded L'Aternot would open fire providing covering fire for the

2412
02:36:07.48 --> 02:36:13.32
team. During one short, L'Aternot, Cowboy even planted a claymore mind in the direction of the

2413
02:36:13.32 --> 02:36:18.68
advancing NVA and L'Aternot dug out another claymore from his rucksack in place to 10 second

2414
02:36:18.68 --> 02:36:25.000
delayed fuse on it. When the NVA advanced again, Cowboy ignited his claymore mind. The NVA moved

2415
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.40
towards the team again, L'Aternot ignited his fuse and ran down the hill with Cowboy to catch

2416
02:36:29.40 --> 02:36:35.16
up to their team. Before they reach the team, two B-40 Antipersonal rockets slammed into the trees

2417
02:36:35.16 --> 02:36:40.76
above them, shouring them with trap-no. A few more exploded as L'Aternot and Cowboy moved down the hill.

2418
02:36:41.32 --> 02:36:46.20
Then the 10 second fuse ignited another claymore, it brought Pet Press's time for the gun

2419
02:36:46.20 --> 02:36:51.88
and run team of L'Aternot and Cowboy to turn to cover ground and catch up to the remainder of ST

2420
02:36:51.88 --> 02:36:57.40
Virginia. As children called in air strikes, L'Aternot reflected on how surreal the firefighted

2421
02:36:57.40 --> 02:37:02.36
men. It wasn't anything like he had witnessed on television or in any movie. Instead of men charging

2422
02:37:02.36 --> 02:37:07.08
each other and killing each other in plain sight, here in Triple canopy jungle, he observed green

2423
02:37:07.08 --> 02:37:14.12
tracers from AK-47's first or at the most an enemy hand or foot. And somehow the NVA found

2424
02:37:14.12 --> 02:37:20.36
firing lanes where they could launch shoulder held B-40 Antipersonal rockets that slammed above

2425
02:37:20.36 --> 02:37:27.56
them and around them as they race down the hill. Again, the voices of his special forces and

2426
02:37:27.56 --> 02:37:32.12
structures echoed in his mind. They had told the young aspiring green braze at Fort Bragg that

2427
02:37:32.12 --> 02:37:36.84
the NVA was a tough resilient opponent. Many had fought against the Japanese during World War II

2428
02:37:36.84 --> 02:37:43.40
and against the French driving them from Vietnam in 1954. The sounds of King Bees in the distance

2429
02:37:43.40 --> 02:37:48.44
and the crashing thunder of B-40 rockets slamming into trees above his head shook L'Aternot out of

2430
02:37:48.44 --> 02:37:55.32
his moment of introspection and turned his undivided attention to the crescendo of AK-47 fire from

2431
02:37:55.32 --> 02:38:00.60
the enemy. ST Virginia responded with a volley with volley after volley of full and semi-automatic

2432
02:38:00.60 --> 02:38:06.36
gunfire while the turno and show fired several M79 rockets round toward the densest section

2433
02:38:06.36 --> 02:38:13.08
of jungle where the AK-47 gunfire was emanating. Through the gunfire someone popped a smoke grenade

2434
02:38:13.08 --> 02:38:18.44
which brought the King Bees closer to our T-Virginia's location in the jungle. Over the Denogun fire,

2435
02:38:18.44 --> 02:38:23.40
children and cowboy told everyone to put on their Swiss seats and prepare for string extraction.

2436
02:38:23.96 --> 02:38:29.72
In short order, a King Bees was hovering over ST Virginia more than 125 feet above the jungle

2437
02:38:29.72 --> 02:38:35.96
full. L'Aternot, cowboy, show and haunt hooked their D-rings into the old Maguire rig that hung

2438
02:38:35.96 --> 02:38:40.68
from the end of the ropes and shortly were being lifted out of the jungle. As the quartet of

2439
02:38:40.68 --> 02:38:47.96
recon men was being lifted in the air, the NVA released another salvo of AK-47 and B-40 rockets

2440
02:38:47.96 --> 02:38:54.04
strappin' off from the rockets hit them with varying degrees of size and velocity. All of them were wounded.

2441
02:38:54.04 --> 02:38:58.60
It was during these explosions that L'Aternot realized his car 15 and somehow become caught

2442
02:38:58.60 --> 02:39:03.80
the rope above him just far enough away that he couldn't reach it. He pulled out his M79 and launched

2443
02:39:03.80 --> 02:39:08.68
a grenade toward the NVA positions. Now all he could see of the enemy were hundreds of muzzle

2444
02:39:08.68 --> 02:39:15.80
blasts from AK-47s and green trace around climbing upward toward the quartet of ST Virginia men.

2445
02:39:16.36 --> 02:39:21.24
Before he could reload his M79, the King Bees began to move away from the target area, surprising

2446
02:39:21.24 --> 02:39:25.96
him because the men had not cleared the jungle yet. Instead of continuing to climb out of the target,

2447
02:39:25.96 --> 02:39:30.52
moving straight up until the men cleared the jungle's triple canopy of trees and vegetation,

2448
02:39:30.52 --> 02:39:35.24
the King Bees was moving away from the target area due to the heavy enemy ground fire.

2449
02:39:35.24 --> 02:39:39.72
In recent months, at least two King Bees were shot down during the string extractions from hot

2450
02:39:39.72 --> 02:39:43.08
targets but these facts were unknown to L'Aternot at the time.

2451
02:39:43.72 --> 02:39:49.32
Shrapnel from B-40 rockets exploded around the ST Virginia men stringing them with pieces of hot

2452
02:39:49.32 --> 02:39:53.80
metal, stinging them with pieces of hot metal further spooking the King Bee crew.

2453
02:39:53.80 --> 02:39:59.08
L'Aternot began to violently collide with the tall jungle trees, feeling like a metal ball

2454
02:39:59.08 --> 02:40:05.56
in a pinball machine, L'Aternot carooned off several more trees at least one more B-40 exploded

2455
02:40:05.56 --> 02:40:10.84
in the tree tops again shouring him with trapnel. A tree branch hit L'Aternot from one side

2456
02:40:10.84 --> 02:40:16.28
and turned him upside down in his Swiss seat in his Swiss seat. As the rope seat began to slip

2457
02:40:16.28 --> 02:40:21.40
down his hips, L'Aternot remembered spider telling how a one-zero from another team had recently

2458
02:40:21.40 --> 02:40:28.52
shot out of his Swiss seat during a rope extraction. Another tree struck L'Aternot before he was

2459
02:40:28.52 --> 02:40:33.08
able to master the surge of strength and momentum to reach up and grab the rope above him

2460
02:40:33.08 --> 02:40:39.000
as his body finally cleared the tree tops. The only thing between him and certain death below

2461
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:44.52
was the jungle floor 200 feet below was the single piece of rope tied into the King Bee.

2462
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.36
With one final urgent pull, L'Aternot was able to move himself upright in the Swiss seat

2463
02:40:50.36 --> 02:40:55.56
as the King Bee continued to climb higher into the sky, distancing itself from the fury

2464
02:40:55.56 --> 02:41:01.56
of exploding B-40s in AK-47 gunfire while gaining air speed.

2465
02:41:07.24 --> 02:41:13.56
Well there you go. And Calboy was there for that and he was still recovering from the wounds

2466
02:41:13.56 --> 02:41:19.40
from October 5th. Here he is at round Thanksgiving. Yes, so a month and a half later, after your

2467
02:41:19.40 --> 02:41:26.04
October 5th insanity, you're out there again. Almost healed. Almost healed.

2468
02:41:26.04 --> 02:41:37.88
Oh my god. Becow it to three up. Damn one. Yeah. Noom. And another one that sent my village.

2469
02:41:39.40 --> 02:41:45.48
And they won me to go with them. Oh, so that was there from your village and they wanted you to go and help them.

2470
02:41:45.48 --> 02:41:54.12
Go to Virginia. Yeah. And then by the way, the new man, Blap. No, the French man.

2471
02:41:54.12 --> 02:41:57.48
Oh, because this is the French man's first mission. This is Cherry Mission.

2472
02:41:57.48 --> 02:42:05.08
If I'm mission, we don't just, we don't just how he learning. Right. So that's why we got to go strong

2473
02:42:06.28 --> 02:42:14.20
enough to protect him. Sure. And by the child, he's very good. Perfect. He's perfect man. But

2474
02:42:14.20 --> 02:42:22.28
he only won. And then, uh, French man, he's a new guy. We don't know about him. But, you know,

2475
02:42:23.16 --> 02:42:28.36
you know, one zero had run several missions. Yes. Yes. Yes. You know, it's children. They got a

2476
02:42:28.36 --> 02:42:35.000
experience. I don't want you know, the French man like a James Schreit.

2477
02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:43.96
James Schreit, the first mission. Mm-hmm. He's going. And the first mission is easy to go. That's why,

2478
02:42:43.96 --> 02:42:50.44
you know, I'm volunteer to go with the Virginia to take care of my, my three friends,

2479
02:42:51.24 --> 02:42:56.60
send my village. And by the way, that the French man, he's a very new man.

2480
02:42:56.60 --> 02:43:05.16
So maybe, maybe, Sean. Yes. Maybe, Sean. Then we call him, maybe, Sean. But he did okay. But

2481
02:43:06.04 --> 02:43:12.52
he's perfect. Yeah. He's good. You're training good. Did you train him how to kill the dogs?

2482
02:43:13.32 --> 02:43:20.92
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, we, we very like the machine. Yes.

2483
02:43:20.92 --> 02:43:29.80
When I shoot something, he knew I ran out of ammo. He called me and when he ran out of the machine,

2484
02:43:30.52 --> 02:43:39.24
I got the ammo. I called with him. So I can't actually, he like the number two. Yes.

2485
02:43:39.88 --> 02:43:46.76
He's number two. He's number two. Because I was later on, you know, I know he ran a lot of missions.

2486
02:43:46.76 --> 02:43:53.88
And 13. Yes. I know about it. I know he ran a lot of missions. But for sure. That's why he's,

2487
02:43:53.88 --> 02:43:58.44
he still shoot a bag of. But that makes you all the more amazing. Yeah. I mean within the third.

2488
02:43:58.44 --> 02:44:05.000
A month and a half. Yeah. You go from October 5th to this mission as part of your six years

2489
02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:11.24
in size. My scar. Almost here. Not, not really here. Almost here. Well, you got new

2490
02:44:11.24 --> 02:44:17.000
straplals too. Yeah. You had the new straplowns from that. But in order, you know, to,

2491
02:44:18.60 --> 02:44:23.16
because like a you and me right now, I cannot, you know,

2492
02:44:25.48 --> 02:44:31.96
live you alone. Right. I gotta go with you. Sure. Because we glow, friend. Very glow, friend.

2493
02:44:33.56 --> 02:44:38.28
Well, that's, that's what it's all about. And it's, uh, it's amazing to be able to sit here and talk to you.

2494
02:44:38.28 --> 02:44:43.32
I can't believe that I'm sitting here and talking to you. I can't believe that you survived one of

2495
02:44:43.32 --> 02:44:49.40
those missions never mind six years. Yeah. Six years of those missions. I thought just normal.

2496
02:44:50.76 --> 02:44:58.20
No, no, that's not just normal. Like somebody else. No, that's, don't know if they're that. We

2497
02:44:58.20 --> 02:45:05.000
got paid. Yeah. Right. And then we got the bonus. If we do it the good thing. Like we have a,

2498
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:12.84
get a POW. You remember how much you got paid? One picture. That $500. I know $500.

2499
02:45:12.84 --> 02:45:17.64
Yes, just how much is a P. Astor worth. The P. What's on a day? It is maybe a dollar.

2500
02:45:18.04 --> 02:45:24.84
So you go and do these missions for a dollar. You're cheap date. Like a $5,000. $5,000 for a picture.

2501
02:45:24.84 --> 02:45:31.40
Yeah. Okay. And then for a, yes, it was the Vietnamese currency. We can learn a lot from the shop.

2502
02:45:31.40 --> 02:45:40.12
Like you remember, sometimes we got a radio small radio. Right. We get in the jungle. We throw it.

2503
02:45:41.32 --> 02:45:51.56
And then some special camera. And we throw in the jungle. And we learn a lot.

2504
02:45:52.04 --> 02:45:56.76
We put in the centers too. Yes. And the chances of cameras and sensors and camera and

2505
02:45:56.76 --> 02:46:05.40
sensor and radio. You, you, you got to ask me why you told the radio in the jungle. Right.

2506
02:46:05.40 --> 02:46:10.04
Right. I never knew about that. So this is all top secret. So top secret. Even I didn't know

2507
02:46:10.04 --> 02:46:15.48
until then. No, then no, it's top secret. I'm not a chicken. I know the chicken from the,

2508
02:46:16.84 --> 02:46:26.68
from the, from the department. But we don't know or whatever do I have authority to

2509
02:46:26.68 --> 02:46:34.68
speak in that. The radio we throw in the jungle. That's mean, you got to have a question.

2510
02:46:35.96 --> 02:46:43.000
If the communist pick up the radio who's the one to use it. That's square,

2511
02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:48.36
later, a plate to later or company later, and they're blow up. No, they're not blow up.

2512
02:46:48.36 --> 02:46:56.84
So inside the radio, they got a something. When they order anything,

2513
02:46:57.64 --> 02:47:06.20
airplane, no, what's going on? There you go. Wow. Now, we, we learn from them a lot.

2514
02:47:06.20 --> 02:47:15.08
Okay, we talk to them. We learn from them a lot. See it. Or like at the, a flashlight. Yes.

2515
02:47:15.08 --> 02:47:24.20
We throw the jungle. Nobody know. And when we're training to throw the flashlight in the jungle,

2516
02:47:25.96 --> 02:47:32.68
the first question that they asked me, if you see the flashlight in the jungle,

2517
02:47:33.64 --> 02:47:40.84
do you pick it up? I'm going to say no. Do you, you know, you know past the test.

2518
02:47:40.84 --> 02:47:47.08
You should pick it up. For the NBA, my pick it up. Yeah, NBA, you got to pick it up.

2519
02:47:47.08 --> 02:47:50.60
Oh, they're going to pick it up. I'm saying I want to get out of that. Because you have the thing,

2520
02:47:50.60 --> 02:47:56.28
who we try to do something. You're done it. You thought it, it's, it's, it's important thing.

2521
02:47:56.28 --> 02:48:01.000
Just normal thing. Okay. The first question they asked you,

2522
02:48:01.56 --> 02:48:07.16
you see the flashlight in the jungle, do you pick it up? You say no. That's mean,

2523
02:48:07.16 --> 02:48:14.36
something wrong with you. I say yes, right now. And I pick it up. And the second question,

2524
02:48:15.96 --> 02:48:21.72
what, what do you do with the flashlight when you pick it up? Turn it on.

2525
02:48:23.32 --> 02:48:33.64
Turn it on. You fail the test. Because it might end there. How did you know? When you turn it on,

2526
02:48:33.64 --> 02:48:43.56
it blows up. So many, so many learning from, I don't know how to tell you, but you know,

2527
02:48:43.56 --> 02:48:48.36
you did a pretty good job. Yeah, I got to learn the last. I got to learning the last.

2528
02:48:49.56 --> 02:48:55.56
Okay, team moving. Three NBA that followed you,

2529
02:48:55.56 --> 02:49:04.20
the first question that you want to three enemy dead or you want to three, three enemy,

2530
02:49:04.20 --> 02:49:14.60
wouldn't it? If I answered the three enemy dead, you go home. You cannot run three on any more.

2531
02:49:16.44 --> 02:49:22.44
You want to peel w's? I want to three guy at this one guy that wanted.

2532
02:49:22.44 --> 02:49:35.72
Why? Because the team still on the mission. I know the NBA got to take care of them, right?

2533
02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:45.96
So that delay the time that they followed the team. And if you get a pill w, you get a bonus.

2534
02:49:45.96 --> 02:49:51.80
Yeah, it was a lot of piasters for a pill w. Yeah, I love how many bmw a lot.

2535
02:49:51.80 --> 02:50:00.76
Yeah, yeah. Pukupiastes. Pukupiastes. Yeah, like the 100,000, something? Yeah, no. 100,000 piastron.

2536
02:50:01.16 --> 02:50:05.64
Yeah, we only got a hundred dollars. So I know what you we get. I didn't hear about that. So I had a bit.

2537
02:50:07.40 --> 02:50:13.48
The reason that we got a bonus, but now I found that bonus before that, I don't know anything.

2538
02:50:14.60 --> 02:50:20.12
I don't know. Just exactly just empty. I don't know anything about it. But we learn.

2539
02:50:20.12 --> 02:50:28.04
We learn from him. We learn from you. We learn from him. We learn a lot. Every different guy.

2540
02:50:28.04 --> 02:50:32.92
We learn from you. We talk back up there. I learned from him. He learned from me.

2541
02:50:33.88 --> 02:50:41.88
So we we see that out. We so out of spirit. Like I told you, if I show the enemy in the jungle,

2542
02:50:41.88 --> 02:50:51.96
I kill him. It's easy. But in order to complete my duty, I got to stay on the ground my five

2543
02:50:51.96 --> 02:51:00.60
days. That's why I'm not guilty and enemy. I just stay there. They, they pass you

2544
02:51:01.80 --> 02:51:08.44
how smart to handle the, the thing happened. That's why I want to become, you know, the

2545
02:51:08.44 --> 02:51:16.60
recon team, it's very difficult. But especially the first thing it protect Lisa.

2546
02:51:17.24 --> 02:51:25.88
Protect American guy. To first, the first joint. Protect American guy. But we understand that

2547
02:51:27.56 --> 02:51:33.32
we was recourse to refute the American came to the Vietnam.

2548
02:51:33.32 --> 02:51:44.36
That's why I can't tell you that I'm so lucky. I'm not good. But you know, just normal.

2549
02:51:44.36 --> 02:51:52.36
Just bring everything, get normal better than for me. Well, you're definitely, you're definitely lucky

2550
02:51:52.36 --> 02:51:57.32
and I can tell from everything I've seen, you're damn good to. That's a perfect.

2551
02:51:57.32 --> 02:52:06.68
Well, lucky. Yeah, amazing. It's just an amazing story to sit here and talk to you and

2552
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:13.64
get this information and, you know, get other people to be able to hear this story is just, it's awesome.

2553
02:52:13.64 --> 02:52:18.92
Indeed. Do you got anything else to tell? No, this has been a great ride and thank you for

2554
02:52:18.92 --> 02:52:28.44
bringing us together. This is really a special day. It's awesome. You got anything else? Come on. Thank you.

2555
02:52:28.44 --> 02:52:39.000
To invite me to be here today. I'll country situation right now. I'm very sad.

2556
02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:53.56
I can tell you my dad got a die by the social open. My father did become unity. He's a

2557
02:52:53.56 --> 02:53:01.24
capitalist. He's not very rich man, but he's middle guy. He's middle in the Vietnam.

2558
02:53:01.24 --> 02:53:11.32
But the communism, it's no good at all. Please send the message to the people.

2559
02:53:12.68 --> 02:53:21.88
Don't just the communism. That's why I can say that we here, we saved it. But

2560
02:53:21.88 --> 02:53:37.24
after the vote for president situation right now, I'm sad. To let the, at my knowledge, I don't know

2561
02:53:37.24 --> 02:53:47.72
it true or not, but another hand from the communism, touched to the United States of America.

2562
02:53:47.72 --> 02:53:58.76
I be here for 80, I need 32 years. I never get back to the country. I never visit the Vietnam

2563
02:53:59.64 --> 02:54:06.04
even I want to go back there, but for the funerals, I fall out from our friend and Steve back

2564
02:54:06.04 --> 02:54:17.40
in the Vietnam. But the Vietnamese government will let me get in. If you don't just me, I got a

2565
02:54:17.40 --> 02:54:30.04
paper working there. Me trust you. We do. I work with the General Smith, who's the MIA

2566
02:54:31.24 --> 02:54:41.16
accounting? His came in the Hawaii Smith, Camp Smith. This is several years ago, right? No,

2567
02:54:41.16 --> 02:54:51.80
it like the 15, 20 years ago. Okay. I went with him regarding about pure darkness. Yes.

2568
02:54:52.44 --> 02:54:59.08
Can't climb Robinton and Hongkai, you know, like the helicopter stride, yeah, stride.

2569
02:55:00.52 --> 02:55:06.04
But they won't let me get there. I ever met family with the

2570
02:55:06.04 --> 02:55:17.56
family. I'm picking up the name, the gang right now, because of Paul King. Yes,

2571
02:55:17.56 --> 02:55:24.36
going to be able to poke. It was King and crying over Ka on Alaska when John Allen escaped. He

2572
02:55:24.36 --> 02:55:33.16
needed. Well, I can tell you, I think one of the reasons that you start seeing these things in

2573
02:55:33.16 --> 02:55:40.12
America is people don't understand communism and they don't realize how evil it is. And so you

2574
02:55:40.12 --> 02:55:45.48
coming on here and sharing your story and explaining what you went through, what your father went through,

2575
02:55:45.48 --> 02:55:50.12
what your family went through at the hands of the communists. I can assure you that there are

2576
02:55:50.68 --> 02:55:54.60
look, there might be some Americans that don't understand, but there are plenty of Americans that

2577
02:55:54.60 --> 02:56:03.40
do understand and we will never let that evil form of government control take over this country.

2578
02:56:03.40 --> 02:56:14.36
It will never happen. Never I believe so. I believe so, but in my shy, I hear, you know, the

2579
02:56:14.36 --> 02:56:26.20
communist want to talk over the US because they mess up, you know, the water. They mess up the computer,

2580
02:56:26.20 --> 02:56:37.48
what for the president, he turned over to Mr Joe Biden. I heard a lot of information. So I scan it.

2581
02:56:37.48 --> 02:56:45.24
I want to buy a boat. I know the boat now. I got to put it in order to help them. I escaped from

2582
02:56:45.88 --> 02:56:51.000
United States. You're not going to need another boat to escape from United States. We will

2583
02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:58.20
make sure that doesn't happen. America is stronger than one person and our roots are deep and we

2584
02:56:58.20 --> 02:57:04.44
will stay a free country. And because of them like you, we're aware of the be here today. Absolutely.

2585
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:11.08
How they mess up the country right now? The Department of the Humanity, the Federal Export,

2586
02:57:11.64 --> 02:57:20.92
the fire and the loss of men get fire. They undercaliable covert to another country.

2587
02:57:22.60 --> 02:57:29.64
Why? You say it's very strong, but we got a tech camp. We got to be careful with it.

2588
02:57:29.64 --> 02:57:42.60
Remember, combination, control the people by food. You don't have a food. You can't do anything.

2589
02:57:44.28 --> 02:57:52.68
That's what they control the people in China. They control the Cuba, they control it. Not Korea.

2590
02:57:52.68 --> 02:58:03.16
You are inside the country. You see, hey, hey, look good. They're good. But inside the country.

2591
02:58:04.84 --> 02:58:17.16
They say you want to food. You're going to do it. They want to water. You do it. They want to

2592
02:58:17.16 --> 02:58:27.24
fish. One month for two or three fish. You gotta do it. I give you the paperwork to go by from the

2593
02:58:27.24 --> 02:58:35.80
strong. It's not free. Like here, you're nice to that people. You want anything. You have everything.

2594
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:46.28
You can work for that. You want anything? You got a list and all by me. What do you do?

2595
02:58:47.56 --> 02:58:52.92
Just me about the way you did. You say a very strong country. No.

2596
02:58:52.92 --> 02:59:07.64
You see it? It's no COVID. How do government say you need a tech mass? Thinking about it.

2597
02:59:08.44 --> 02:59:17.72
Why? You know, mid-the-export. He commander with the United States Army. He got fire and another

2598
02:59:17.72 --> 02:59:27.80
three-year fire, too. I'm looking back. I asked you the question. I'm wondering, don't lose

2599
02:59:27.80 --> 02:59:34.76
anything, right? But why we still get out of Vietnam? Why we lose Vietnam? You're out of this.

2600
02:59:34.76 --> 02:59:44.60
Quality. Because now it's politics, but with my experience, the quality they can control.

2601
02:59:44.60 --> 02:59:51.24
You're not the hero guy. Like a hero like a man. And then we just them. We're gonna die.

2602
02:59:52.92 --> 03:00:03.64
Like the, the time of your mid-the-Obbama. Do you see the picture of Marine in the board?

2603
03:00:04.28 --> 03:00:13.48
Surah. What did you think? That was not a good situation. That's all. But why? We still have a picture.

2604
03:00:13.48 --> 03:00:22.76
Because people, by the way, in the Washington. Like the mid-the-Trump, they can't do anything.

2605
03:00:24.92 --> 03:00:34.04
We're the soldier. We gotta do. And we gotta follow with the order. But they are to us to come to die.

2606
03:00:34.04 --> 03:00:45.32
So I'm not a polarist guy. I'm, you know, retired. Man, 72 years old. I can't do anything. I can make any money.

2607
03:00:45.32 --> 03:00:54.60
But I am pretty much a student. My grandchild. Grow up. Live in a new combination.

2608
03:00:56.20 --> 03:01:00.52
Well, that's a good point. And I appreciate that point. You know, I'm sitting here sitting here saying,

2609
03:01:00.52 --> 03:01:06.76
oh, America's strong. But your point is we can't get arrogant and think that it can't happen to us.

2610
03:01:06.76 --> 03:01:13.16
We have to remain vigilant all the time. Trust, but verify. And do you sure?

2611
03:01:15.32 --> 03:01:20.04
Well, once again, thank you for coming on. Thank you for sharing your stories.

2612
03:01:20.76 --> 03:01:24.60
You're always welcome here. Both you guys. Obviously, you're always welcome here.

2613
03:01:24.60 --> 03:01:32.04
Thanks for coming to sharing your story. And thank you more importantly for your service to

2614
03:01:32.04 --> 03:01:40.76
your country, to this country, to defend freedom and democracy in the world. And thank you for

2615
03:01:40.76 --> 03:01:46.12
taking care of your big American brothers on the battlefield. This shield, your Vietnamese brothers,

2616
03:01:46.12 --> 03:01:55.96
as well. And thank you for you and your family's sacrifice on the altar of freedom. Amen. Thank you.

2617
03:01:58.76 --> 03:02:09.000
And with that tilt and cowboy con, have left the building, leaving nothing but respect and

2618
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.96
admiration for incredible service, incredible men and everything that they've gone to.

2619
03:02:13.96 --> 03:02:19.000
Everything they've gone through, echo Charles, you were sitting in the corner. Yes. We

2620
03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:25.96
have room for you at the table. That's okay. Pretty insane, right? Yes. Very much. So yeah, it's

2621
03:02:27.40 --> 03:02:33.80
it's a little bit different when I'm like, ex, not ex-cluded, but ex not in on the table.

2622
03:02:33.80 --> 03:02:39.64
Every touch. Yeah, I'm detached even more. So yeah, it is interesting. You can kind of

2623
03:02:39.64 --> 03:02:45.72
see and imagine really kind of what's going on and what like everyone went through and how it

2624
03:02:45.72 --> 03:02:51.56
was being like in a different culture, you know, and with military and stuff and then you kind of

2625
03:02:51.56 --> 03:02:56.20
compare it to all the people that have come on and share their story. Yeah, very interesting.

2626
03:02:56.84 --> 03:03:02.52
The crazy thing is they'll all those back to back to back to back years of doing these missions.

2627
03:03:02.52 --> 03:03:06.84
I mean, the saw guys could barely get out of their alive. And here's, there's no getting out.

2628
03:03:06.84 --> 03:03:11.96
Okay, so there's this part. This might seem kind of random, but this part of that, I remember

2629
03:03:11.96 --> 03:03:17.16
where he said that he could smell. He could smell. Yeah, he could be up with that. Yeah. Yeah.

2630
03:03:17.88 --> 03:03:22.76
So, and I'll thinking about it where it's like, yeah, I see how that could be really.

2631
03:03:22.76 --> 03:03:27.56
When you're so used to a certain environment, you can tell just a little differences, like

2632
03:03:27.56 --> 03:03:38.12
100% of that. So, uh, ever using things like when you're at home, right? And if someone just came

2633
03:03:38.12 --> 03:03:43.32
over and just left, you come in. I don't even know if you can smell them, but it's probably

2634
03:03:43.32 --> 03:03:47.08
has something to do with smell. Or you can definitely smell it. You know how you can put it this way.

2635
03:03:47.08 --> 03:03:51.08
That's what I thought to you that you could smell them, but I can't smell something specific.

2636
03:03:51.08 --> 03:03:56.20
I know it just smells different. You know that feeling, so it's like it almost does feel like a

2637
03:03:56.20 --> 03:04:01.96
little bit of a sense. You know? So imagine that, like, or like, you know how like your

2638
03:04:01.96 --> 03:04:06.76
your furniture will be moved just a little bit and you walk in, like, you know, have a little

2639
03:04:06.76 --> 03:04:13.16
home office, whatever, and there's this couch. And when I put it in there, it is, it's the perfect,

2640
03:04:13.16 --> 03:04:18.60
like I've been stakingly put it a certain distance from the, there's a TV in there too. And

2641
03:04:18.60 --> 03:04:27.08
so, in your home office, you have a couch and a TV. Yes, that's some other stuff. That's cool.

2642
03:04:27.08 --> 03:04:33.88
And then I make videos. Got it. Anyway, so one time I was fixing something underneath the couch

2643
03:04:33.88 --> 03:04:37.80
and I just, you know, had to apparently move it just a little bit and just didn't think about it.

2644
03:04:37.80 --> 03:04:42.60
And then when I walked in, like, later that night or whatever, I was like immediately felt it.

2645
03:04:42.60 --> 03:04:49.80
It was off by, like, literally one inch, literally. And I could feel it. I looked at it. It was like

2646
03:04:49.80 --> 03:04:54.04
through me off, you know? So that's kind of the kind of stuff you're thinking. Yeah, and those guys

2647
03:04:54.04 --> 03:04:59.72
growing up in the jungle, they grow up in the jungle. Yeah. And so they're just a hundred percent

2648
03:04:59.72 --> 03:05:06.12
in tune with it. And then you got the big, gringo's coming in, you know, and till it keeps calling

2649
03:05:06.12 --> 03:05:14.92
himself a city slicker. Amazing. Amazing guys. Well, when I hear stories like that, it certainly

2650
03:05:14.92 --> 03:05:21.72
makes me feel like we can step up our game. Like I can definitely step up my game. Like I can

2651
03:05:23.32 --> 03:05:28.20
do better. Do better. Always training, like colleagues. Oh man, Cowboys. And you know what?

2652
03:05:28.20 --> 03:05:32.28
I don't know if we captured it because we were talking before we pressed record, but he started

2653
03:05:32.28 --> 03:05:37.64
getting really into training. He was like, well, how well they trained. And he did mention it

2654
03:05:37.64 --> 03:05:43.48
a bunch. You know, he did mention a bunch, but he gave kind of the foundational part about training

2655
03:05:43.48 --> 03:05:49.88
before we pressed record. You know, like the foundational, how much it meant. So he kept saying it,

2656
03:05:49.88 --> 03:05:55.000
and he really reiterated it, especially at the end. You know, he was reiterating it. But yeah,

2657
03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:59.48
it's no doubt, you've always got to train. Always got to be prepared. You never know.

2658
03:05:59.48 --> 03:06:04.52
You never know what's going to happen. Train harder. Yeah, kind of applies to everything. To

2659
03:06:04.52 --> 03:06:10.12
even if you don't necessarily want to think of it in terms of like, oh, there's an enemy out there,

2660
03:06:10.12 --> 03:06:16.20
you know, literally, or even figuratively, if you don't necessarily want to think about that

2661
03:06:16.20 --> 03:06:21.64
part of it all the time, it's it has to do with capability because enemy that can be anything if you

2662
03:06:21.64 --> 03:06:26.92
want to go metaphor. You're preaching the wrong guy here. I'm down with, but I live for a

2663
03:06:26.92 --> 03:06:34.44
little bit. Okay. Oh, well, let's face it. If you have a let's say you're bringing home a,

2664
03:06:34.44 --> 03:06:38.52
you know, there's big water jugs, five gallon water jugs. Yeah. You put in a water cooler, whatever.

2665
03:06:38.52 --> 03:06:42.84
Let's say you bring in some of those home. Okay. And let's say you don't have a lift gate on your

2666
03:06:42.84 --> 03:06:48.20
truck or you, you just have a car, you have a car, but it's in the back seat. And now you got to

2667
03:06:48.20 --> 03:06:54.44
reach in there and you got to grab it at this awkward angle. Same saying that in and of itself could

2668
03:06:54.44 --> 03:07:01.56
be an enemy. Yeah. Never mind the NVA storming your position. Yeah. More important could the water

2669
03:07:01.56 --> 03:07:07.48
bottle is just near the chance of an NVA storming your position today. A little bit lower than you

2670
03:07:07.48 --> 03:07:13.000
grab in a water. Yeah. Maybe I don't know. I don't know. Everyone's different. I get it. Nonetheless,

2671
03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:17.32
point still remains. Look, we're trying to keep ourselves capable. We're trying to train,

2672
03:07:17.32 --> 03:07:25.08
want to keep training. Regardless of how often you are, what's performing? Performing? We'll

2673
03:07:25.08 --> 03:07:28.60
call it a performance. Well, you are actually our performing all the time. It's another way of

2674
03:07:28.60 --> 03:07:32.12
thinking if things and performing and training all the time. Because you have to learn from your

2675
03:07:32.12 --> 03:07:38.28
performance, right? You say it's like a, you know, those deals. Anyway, all right, we're doing it.

2676
03:07:38.28 --> 03:07:48.28
Um, through training, comes beatings, comes breakdowns, more or less. Mm-hmm. Most of the time.

2677
03:07:48.28 --> 03:07:52.28
Actually all the time, sometimes I just got to leave you to figure it out. Like those statements right

2678
03:07:52.28 --> 03:07:57.48
there. Oh, I can tell you're maybe you threw out there as if you'd get some support. No,

2679
03:07:57.48 --> 03:08:04.20
I did come. I do do that sometimes, but this is not one of those times. Here's check.

2680
03:08:04.20 --> 03:08:11.56
Anyway, when we build ourselves back up, the benefits of training. Sometimes we get little nagging things

2681
03:08:12.60 --> 03:08:16.60
in our joints or other places, whatever. We don't want to worry about that kind of stuff. So

2682
03:08:17.48 --> 03:08:23.80
Jocco has joint warfare, super-cruil oil. These are supplements, supplementation for your joints.

2683
03:08:23.80 --> 03:08:27.48
Okay. So the whole line is called Jocco fuel. So with that, Jocco fuel for your joints

2684
03:08:27.48 --> 03:08:32.68
has, like I said, joint warfare, super-cruil oil. We also have for your brain and body, by the way.

2685
03:08:32.68 --> 03:08:38.84
Is a, I don't want to call it a product, even though it is a product.

2686
03:08:39.88 --> 03:08:44.76
Okay. I'm going to call it a product. We have a product. Don't call it a product. All right. See you. Okay.

2687
03:08:44.76 --> 03:08:51.48
You feel me then. Uh, well, that's thing. Yeah. That's been, we have a thing called substance. This is a plan.

2688
03:08:52.68 --> 03:08:59.08
So it's discipline. You can take this form of supplementation in actually in a few forms. So you got

2689
03:08:59.08 --> 03:09:03.000
the powder version, mix it with the water. That's what I did today. Yes, sir.

2690
03:09:04.28 --> 03:09:08.44
Pill don't mix it with water just swallow it. This swallow it. Maybe with some water, whatever.

2691
03:09:08.44 --> 03:09:14.60
Okay, or quicker. Quick hitter or in the cans. Kind of like an energy drink, if you will.

2692
03:09:15.48 --> 03:09:21.64
Except for one that's literally good for you. Actually, helps you. Actually, help. Yeah. So yes,

2693
03:09:21.64 --> 03:09:26.44
your real energy. Yes, not fit. You know what else gives you energy? Cocaine, apparently.

2694
03:09:26.44 --> 03:09:32.36
Okay. All right. That's what I heard today. My favorite cocaine gives you energy. Makes you feel like,

2695
03:09:32.36 --> 03:09:37.72
hey, I'm going to go and work hard right now. Energetic or crystal meth and fetamine apparently. Yeah.

2696
03:09:37.72 --> 03:09:42.04
Yes, you're energy too. Live with different play. Yeah. Now, you don't go around saying,

2697
03:09:42.04 --> 03:09:46.04
hey, you should, oh, you need some energy. Do some cocaine. We're not doing that. It's unhealthy.

2698
03:09:46.04 --> 03:09:51.08
It's bad for us. It's unhealthy. Yeah, sure. There's other the category that you just used

2699
03:09:51.08 --> 03:09:58.20
quote, energy drinks, which are in the same realm. Potentially. Not quite. But okay,

2700
03:09:58.20 --> 03:10:03.32
maybe not quite. I understand what you're saying. No, fully. Yes. So yeah, a lot of times when

2701
03:10:03.32 --> 03:10:08.28
an energy drink, you're like, hey, let's, let's drink like two, three, four, five energy drinks.

2702
03:10:08.28 --> 03:10:11.88
So you can be like, I don't know about all that. Shouldn't we not be drinking energy drinks?

2703
03:10:11.88 --> 03:10:15.72
It's kind of you have that feeling a lot of this. Yes. It seems to be insane. But this link

2704
03:10:15.72 --> 03:10:21.32
go in the can may even actually might even kind of look like an energy drink. It does it. It's just not

2705
03:10:21.32 --> 03:10:25.56
like that. It's this is the actual healthy things. Real energy. Because that's what I was going to say.

2706
03:10:25.56 --> 03:10:31.32
Because cocaine is not real energy. Well, it depends on what you mean, but real and it depends on what

2707
03:10:31.32 --> 03:10:36.76
you mean by energy. Okay. I mean in the spirit of fear. Well, I have to get some, uh, some somebody

2708
03:10:36.76 --> 03:10:42.60
with some expertise in cocaine in here too. Just got an energy and energy. And energy. No,

2709
03:10:42.60 --> 03:10:47.16
you know what I'm saying healthy energy drink. Oh, you're saying, don't do cocaine. Yes. Instead,

2710
03:10:47.16 --> 03:10:55.64
correct. Try discipline going again. All of the negative benefits. No. Do you remember that?

2711
03:10:55.64 --> 03:11:02.44
No, not all those things I got. I brought, I was on Theo Vans podcast. And he was drinking

2712
03:11:03.32 --> 03:11:09.16
a discipline go and he said something really funny. And he gets, it's kind of slid under the radar

2713
03:11:09.16 --> 03:11:14.76
comment. But he said something comparing it to cocaine. And he said, I think I'm going back on a

2714
03:11:14.76 --> 03:11:20.84
cocaine. Yeah. That's what's in my brain right now. Yeah. That's weird because I don't like,

2715
03:11:20.84 --> 03:11:26.68
I don't pound well. I have. I want like drink the whole thing super fast. But then actually,

2716
03:11:26.68 --> 03:11:31.88
that's not sure I have. But when you drink it super fast, then yeah, I think you'll get a like a little

2717
03:11:31.88 --> 03:11:40.52
jolt. Yeah. Well, super fast, meaning how long when you down it like in three, four or less hits.

2718
03:11:40.52 --> 03:11:45.08
Oh, that's a, that's definitely down in the lab one for sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. But no,

2719
03:11:45.08 --> 03:11:53.40
if I if I drink like two over the course of a podcast, like I will not feel like what I imagine,

2720
03:11:53.40 --> 03:11:58.12
cocaine feels like. Yeah. I've never done cocaine. Yeah. I mean, either. Nonetheless,

2721
03:11:58.12 --> 03:12:04.04
it's not cocaine. It's good for you. Yeah. It's a crystal method and fedamine and cocaine are

2722
03:12:04.04 --> 03:12:10.84
not good for you. No, I know. Yes. Jocardism and go is good for you. Okay. Well, I think that's what

2723
03:12:10.84 --> 03:12:15.88
we're trying to say over here. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Also, it's being a good for you. By the mean D three,

2724
03:12:16.68 --> 03:12:25.64
yeah. Jocco fuel, very good for you. Keep you healthy immune system strong, also immune system strong,

2725
03:12:25.64 --> 03:12:31.80
stuff cold war is another one. So boom, you got the whole gambit. Yeah. What's gambit, right?

2726
03:12:31.80 --> 03:12:37.16
That's correct. That's good. Did you see? We're using a poll. Yeah. Oh, no, stuff. You know,

2727
03:12:37.16 --> 03:12:42.04
for that kind of stuff, you don't want to worry about. You see, yeah, plus we got milk. We got

2728
03:12:42.04 --> 03:12:47.000
warrior kid milk, which is protein that tastes good, plus we got Jocco White T and plus all the

2735
03:13:26.84 --> 03:13:32.28
Also, yes, so you mentioned originmain.com or back to originmain.com. This is what you where you can

03:13:40.84 --> 03:13:45.48

2738
03:13:47.32 --> 03:13:53.08
aside from board shorts, they're the only shorts I wear. But you know, they wear board shorts.

2739
03:13:53.08 --> 03:13:59.32
Very often. Oh, yes, I do. Oh, in the on the massive justice. Matt's of justice. Work out.

Every single day in Hawaii. Yeah. It's either board shorts or that straight up. Got it. Check.

2741
03:14:07.96 --> 03:14:13.24
I jumped the proverbial gun on that one. Oh, good. Hey, we're all here training learning.

2742
03:14:13.24 --> 03:14:18.36
Also, because I only see you in the origin shorts. The shark fin short. That's the only

2743
03:14:18.36 --> 03:14:24.36
shorts I see you in because unless we're on the mats. Right. Yeah. Objustice. Yeah.

2744
03:14:25.08 --> 03:14:32.60
Screw. Also, at originmain, still in our domain, genes American made denim from the

2745
03:14:32.60 --> 03:14:39.08
cotton grown to make the fabric to make the denim to make the genes all made in America.

2746
03:14:39.08 --> 03:14:44.28
Yeah. By the way, also boots on there. Don't get genes are back in the game. Yeah. Delta

2747
03:14:44.28 --> 03:14:48.68
Seek. I'm wearing them right now. Yeah. I saw that. Yeah. That's fun. And I saw you, you kind of like

2748
03:14:48.68 --> 03:14:53.000
gave me a you grabbed the material and kind of pulled it. Right. What was your assessment?

2749
03:14:53.88 --> 03:14:59.16
Yeah. I'll for yeah. Well, my assessment was that they have some give some legitimate give to

2750
03:14:59.16 --> 03:15:04.12
them and it did I just reflect it on the fact that I don't have any. I'm really sorry, but

2751
03:15:04.12 --> 03:15:09.72
the new Delta genes are freaking and they are a little bit new. So we had the original Delta

2752
03:15:09.72 --> 03:15:15.56
genes and then during COVID we re-engineered some stuff. We got some denim that we liked even more.

2753
03:15:17.08 --> 03:15:23.08
Read the what is it? The cut. Yeah. They're just they're just freaking awesome now. So

2754
03:15:23.08 --> 03:15:31.16
where they always dark like that dark you probably see I my OG pair of Delta's that I just

2755
03:15:31.16 --> 03:15:35.16
wore. I wear them all the time and so they they're like genes because they fade a little bit. They

2756
03:15:35.16 --> 03:15:39.48
fade as time goes on. So the pair that you're seeing right now are basically. Oh, right. I knew.

2757
03:15:39.48 --> 03:15:46.60
Gotcha. No, I like the dark denim. Yeah. Well, it will fade over time. Right on. Cool. Yeah.

2758
03:15:46.60 --> 03:15:51.80
So what do you mean? Duck home. Also boots. I forgot that. Yeah. Don't forget about the same deal. Yeah.

2759
03:15:51.80 --> 03:15:59.24
Works of art. Art for your feet. Free of feet. Made in America. Oh, good. Also,

2760
03:15:59.24 --> 03:16:03.56
jacquoise stores called jacquoise store. This is where you can get a discipline equals freedom,

2761
03:16:03.56 --> 03:16:09.64
shirts, hats, hoodies, lightweight and heavy by the way. So when the stuff on there are some

2762
03:16:09.64 --> 03:16:15.56
beenies, some rash guards, some soap, some soap, some warrior kid soap or you can soap,

2763
03:16:15.56 --> 03:16:22.60
jacquoise soap, trooper soap. Yeah. Killer soap. By the way, all this stuff that we're talking about. If you

2764
03:16:22.60 --> 03:16:31.000
want to support the podcast, you want to provide some level of. Sip arch. All the stuff helps us out.

2765
03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:38.20
You know, that way, that way we don't have to get sponsors. Yeah. There's this might be annoying.

2766
03:16:38.20 --> 03:16:44.52
Which I'm sure it is. Oh, this whole thing. But okay, maybe not for you. But for a lot of people, this

2767
03:16:44.52 --> 03:16:48.44
might be super annoying. But the cool thing is you don't have to listen to it. We didn't put it in the

2768
03:16:48.44 --> 03:16:56.36
middle of, you know, cut off cowboy and just start. Here's a word from, whatever. We're not doing that.

2769
03:16:56.36 --> 03:17:01.56
Yeah, that is. So we appreciate it when you get, if you look, we need stuff and I'm out of big,

2770
03:17:02.28 --> 03:17:06.92
what's the, what's the minute? I will look when I want to be a minimalist. Right? We want to be a minimalist.

2771
03:17:06.92 --> 03:17:10.76
I don't want to be a bunch of stuff. But there's stuff that you do need. For instance, do you need a

2772
03:17:10.76 --> 03:17:16.44
a geek? Yes, you do. Do you need a pair of jeans? Yes, you do. Do you need a t-shirt? Yes, you do.

2773
03:17:16.44 --> 03:17:21.88
Do you need food? Yes, you do. Do you need supplementation? Yes, you, like, all these, we're just making

2774
03:17:21.88 --> 03:17:26.84
stuff that you need. So if you need it, you can get it from us. It helps out the podcast. It provides

2775
03:17:26.84 --> 03:17:31.64
that a little bit of that support. So yeah, it's like a win-win. Can I help say everything? Yeah,

2776
03:17:31.64 --> 03:17:39.32
you could go to like a local store. It's by right? Yeah, you could. After jeans that were made in China,

2777
03:17:39.32 --> 03:17:46.36
yeah, you could do that. I mean, you are allowed to, but it's not really, it's not really,

2778
03:17:47.88 --> 03:17:52.36
let's face it's not really what you want to do. No, very questionable. First question,

2779
03:17:52.36 --> 03:17:57.56
it will behave here. Anyways, speaking of this podcast, you can say anyway. No, no, okay,

2780
03:17:57.56 --> 03:18:04.44
it's because subscribing actually. So, Jocca, subscribe to the store. Okay. So we have a t-shirt club.

2781
03:18:04.44 --> 03:18:11.08
We'll call it a subscription scenario where you get a, like, a, how should I say, like a unique,

2782
03:18:11.08 --> 03:18:16.68
unique, I guess, yeah, I guess that's a given. Anyway, you get to share every month that's kind of more,

2783
03:18:16.68 --> 03:18:23.40
like, it's different, but it's still in the game on the path, et cetera. Anyway,

2784
03:18:23.40 --> 03:18:27.40
goodjocca start.com and you can check them out and see if you like that one. But yeah, that's a cool

2785
03:18:27.40 --> 03:18:33.08
little thing people been doing that we offer. It's pretty cool. And then if you get a t-shirt from this

2786
03:18:33.08 --> 03:18:40.68
thing, you can't get it anywhere else. No, you can't even really get it on the store really.

2787
03:18:40.68 --> 03:18:45.32
It's they're only for like, you'll see like when you see kind of the examples of someone you

2788
03:18:45.32 --> 03:18:49.80
be like, okay, this kind of makes sense. They're fun and they're, you know, play, yeah, we have,

2789
03:18:49.80 --> 03:18:54.52
we're, there's always all kinds of cool ideas that come in for shirts for this for that,

2790
03:18:54.52 --> 03:19:01.000
but we can't just execute them all. No, they're very level scale. Yeah. So, you know, we're doing

2791
03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:07.96
a lot of an exclusive scale kind of. Yeah. No, what do you mean kind of? I don't know. I don't know

2792
03:19:07.96 --> 03:19:13.32
what you meant by scale. That's an exclusive scale meaning we're not doing it on a mass scale.

2793
03:19:13.32 --> 03:19:17.64
Hey, everyone that wants one of these, no, it's on a more exclusive scale. Like, oh, we don't have to

2794
03:19:17.64 --> 03:19:22.52
make whatever, however many, whatever number of t-shirts is, there's no what, but someone's going

2795
03:19:22.52 --> 03:19:26.76
order. Yeah. Yeah, you're correct. If they're in the game, then we know it and you get a shirt.

2796
03:19:26.76 --> 03:19:34.28
Yeah, that's cool. That looks more layers. There are many layers all infused in that situation.

2797
03:19:34.28 --> 03:19:40.68
No, I see us. Jocalsore.com. Also, like, Jocals in the K-80, you can subscribe to this podcast on

2798
03:19:41.96 --> 03:19:46.84
where we subscribe to podcast. There you go, boom. And don't forget about the unraveling podcast

2799
03:19:47.88 --> 03:19:52.92
that I, I also record and don't forget about the grounded podcast, which we are supposed to

2800
03:19:52.92 --> 03:19:57.16
record, but we haven't recorded a lot of, don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast, which

2801
03:19:57.96 --> 03:20:03.32
hopefully during Thanksgiving, when some people don't have to work, I'll be able to

2802
03:20:03.96 --> 03:20:09.24
slip in there and record some Warrior Kid podcast. So we're going to work on that one. Don't forget

2803
03:20:09.24 --> 03:20:17.000
about we have a YouTube channel, a YouTube channel. And this is where the creative mind of echo

2804
03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:26.76
Charles manifests itself via explosions, tanks, airplanes. And if you want to watch a video that's

2805
03:20:26.76 --> 03:20:30.36
30 seconds long that has a lot of stuff blown up, go there. If you also want to watch a video

2806
03:20:30.36 --> 03:20:35.48
that's four hours long with nothing blowing up, you also go there. Yeah, boom. Yes, that is true,

2807
03:20:35.48 --> 03:20:40.76
YouTube channel. Good, official, by the way. Also, psychological warfare, if you don't know what that is,

2808
03:20:40.76 --> 03:20:48.60
it's an album, audio album, tracks of Jocco telling you, explain to you how to get past your moments

2809
03:20:48.60 --> 03:20:55.000
of weakness in the event of them arising, which they do from time to time. Let's face it. But yeah,

2810
03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:00.20
have Jocco there, just tell you, hey, you shouldn't do this, you should do this. See this thing,

2811
03:21:00.20 --> 03:21:06.44
you're thinking about doing that you won't want to have done. Don't do that. Don't do that,

2812
03:21:06.44 --> 03:21:12.60
thank you. Jocco version of that. It's actually really helpful. My opinion, we also have a visual

2813
03:21:12.60 --> 03:21:18.84
version of that flipsidecampus.com to code a Meyer making all kinds of cool stuff. There's a bunch

2814
03:21:18.84 --> 03:21:23.40
of books. What books do we cover today? Well, we're talking about sag. So if you're going to jump

2815
03:21:23.40 --> 03:21:28.36
in a sag, you can get across the fence on the ground and sag the chronicles by John Stryker Meyer

2816
03:21:28.36 --> 03:21:37.000
and then you can also get whiskey, tango, fox trot by Lynn Black. You need about face by David

2817
03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:42.36
Hackworth. There's a new version now, a re-release that I wrote the forward to. There's leadership

2818
03:21:42.36 --> 03:21:46.60
strategy and tactics field manual. There's the code, the protocols and the evaluations.

2819
03:21:46.60 --> 03:21:50.20
There's discipline, it's freedom field manual. There's a brand new version of that out. That's

2820
03:21:50.20 --> 03:21:57.40
a good go to for that Christmas scenario. The holiday scenario. Check that one out.

2821
03:21:57.40 --> 03:22:04.76
Way the warrior kid for field manual is also, I think it's live right now. Yeah, it's live.

2822
03:22:04.76 --> 03:22:08.92
Way the warrior kid for field manual. Here's the thing on all these. From what I understand,

2823
03:22:09.56 --> 03:22:17.80
Intel, there's going to be a shortage of aircraft, trucks and laborers, drivers, pilots,

2824
03:22:18.20 --> 03:22:22.76
during Christmas because everything is going to be shipped. So if you want to get any of this

2825
03:22:22.76 --> 03:22:29.56
stuff, even though I know you were all trying to be minimalist, but kids need a freaking book to read.

2826
03:22:29.56 --> 03:22:33.40
So get them way the warrior kid for field manual. Way the warrior kid one, two and three,
