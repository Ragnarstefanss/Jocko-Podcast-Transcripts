[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 10 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:11] Assault into hell.
[00:00:16] We waited a seeming eternity for the signal to start towards the beach.
[00:00:20] This suspense was almost more than I could bear.
[00:00:24] Waiting is a major part of war, but I never experienced any more supremely agonizing suspense
[00:00:29] in the extruciating torture of those moments before we received the signal to begin the assault
[00:00:35] on Pelaloo.
[00:00:37] I broke out and a cold sweat as the tension mounted with the intensity of the bombardment.
[00:00:42] My stomach was tied in knots.
[00:00:45] I had a lump in my throat and swallowed only with great difficulty.
[00:00:50] My knees nearly buckled, so I clung weakly to the side of the tractor.
[00:00:55] I felt nauseated and feared that my bladder would surely empty itself and reveal me to be
[00:01:00] the coward I was.
[00:01:03] But the men around me looked just about the same way I felt.
[00:01:07] Finally, with a sense of fatalistic relief, mixed with a flash of anger at the navy officer
[00:01:12] who was our wave commander.
[00:01:15] I saw him wave his flag toward the beach.
[00:01:18] Our driver revved the engine.
[00:01:21] The treads churned up the water and we started in.
[00:01:23] The second wave is sure.
[00:01:26] We moved ahead, watching the frightful spectacle.
[00:01:31] Huge guisers of water rose around the amtrax.
[00:01:34] A head of us, as they approached the reef.
[00:01:37] The beach was now marked along its length by a continuous sheet of flame backed by a thick
[00:01:42] wall of smoke.
[00:01:45] It seemed as though a huge volcano had erupted from the sea and rather than heading for an island,
[00:01:51] we were being drawn into the vortex of a flaming abyss.
[00:01:55] For many, it was to be oblivion.
[00:02:00] Suddenly a large shell exploded with a terrific concussion and a huge guiser rose up right
[00:02:05] next to our front.
[00:02:07] It barely missed us.
[00:02:09] The engine stalled.
[00:02:10] The front of the tractor lurched to the left and bumped hard against the rear of another
[00:02:14] ramp track that was either stalled or hit.
[00:02:17] I never knew which.
[00:02:20] We sat, stalled, floating in the water for some terrifying moments.
[00:02:25] We were sitting ducks for the enemy gunners.
[00:02:28] I look forward through the hatch behind the driver.
[00:02:30] He was wrestling frantically with the control levers.
[00:02:33] Japanese shells were screaming into the air and exploding all around us.
[00:02:37] Sergeant Johnny Marmet leaned toward the driver and yelled something.
[00:02:41] Whatever it was, it seemed to calm the driver because he got the engine started.
[00:02:46] We moved forward again amid the guisers of exploding shells.
[00:02:51] Our bombardment began to lift off the beach and move inland.
[00:02:54] Our dive bombers also moved inland with their strafing and bombing.
[00:02:58] The Japanese increased their volume of fire against the waves of amtrax.
[00:03:03] Above the den, I could hear the ominous sound of shell fragments humming and growling
[00:03:07] through the air.
[00:03:09] Stand by someone yelled.
[00:03:12] Hit the beach, yelled an NCO moments before the machine lurched to a stop.
[00:03:18] The men piled over the sides as fast as they could.
[00:03:20] I followed Snaffu, climbed up and planted both feet firmly on the left side, so as to
[00:03:25] leap as far away from it as possible.
[00:03:28] At that instant, a burst of machine gun fire with white hot tracer snapped through the
[00:03:32] air at eye level, almost grazing my face.
[00:03:35] I pulled back like a turtle, lost my balance and fell awkwardly forward down under the sand.
[00:03:41] In a tangle of ammo bag, pack, helmet, carbean, gas mask, cartridge belt, and flopping
[00:03:46] canteens.
[00:03:48] Get off the beach, get off the beach, race through my mind.
[00:03:53] Shells crashed all around, fragments torn, word, slapping on the sand and splashing
[00:03:58] into the water a few yards behind us.
[00:04:01] The Japanese were recovering from the shock of our pre-landing bombardment.
[00:04:05] Their machine gun and rifle fire got thicker, snapping viciously overhead in an increasing
[00:04:11] volume.
[00:04:13] Up and down the beach and out on the reef, a number of amtrax were burning.
[00:04:18] Japanese machine gun burst made long splashes on the water, as they'll fling it with
[00:04:23] some giant whip.
[00:04:25] The guisers belched up relentlessly where the mortar and artillery shells hit.
[00:04:30] I caught a fleeting glimpse of a group of marines, leaving a smoking amtrak on the reef.
[00:04:38] Some fell as bullets and fragments splashed among them.
[00:04:43] Their buddies tried to help them as they struggled in knee deep water.
[00:04:50] I shuddered and choked.
[00:04:52] A wild desperate feeling of anger, frustration and pity gripped me.
[00:04:57] It was an emotion that would always torture my mind when I saw men trapped and was unable
[00:05:02] to do anything but watch as they were hit.
[00:05:05] My own plate forgotten momentarily, I felt sick into the depths of my soul.
[00:05:11] I asked God, why, why, why?
[00:05:16] I turned my face away and wished that I were imagining it all.
[00:05:20] I tasted the bitterest essence of war.
[00:05:24] The sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered and it filled me with disgust.
[00:05:33] That right there is from a book, an absolutely incredible book called, with the Old
[00:05:43] Breed by Eugene Sledge.
[00:05:48] Eugene Sledge was a Marine, who is a Marine in World War II and he ended up being a university
[00:06:00] professor and an author when he got done.
[00:06:03] He wrote this book.
[00:06:05] I read this book for the first time when I was on deployment to Iraq.
[00:06:09] My first deployment to Iraq.
[00:06:12] And it definitely kept me in check because it made me always remember that what we were
[00:06:24] experiencing, this war that we were in was something that men had always experienced and
[00:06:37] actually they have experienced much, much worse than I ever experienced.
[00:06:45] This book was later used to make the documentary, a PBS documentary called The War.
[00:06:55] And in 2000, I think it came out in 2010 was the HBO mini-series called The Pacific, which
[00:07:02] is an absolutely epic series.
[00:07:09] If you haven't watched The Pacific, it's phenomenal, get it and watch it.
[00:07:16] It's completely realistic.
[00:07:18] One of the things that struck me when I watched it for the first time was he talks about
[00:07:24] the waiting and the very first episode of The Pacific, you're waiting for something
[00:07:31] happened, they're showing the guy's prep and they actually land and you're waiting and
[00:07:35] waiting for something to happen.
[00:07:38] And it doesn't.
[00:07:40] It has this feeling.
[00:07:43] And I remember that feeling, especially being in Ramadi, when you'd be out in the streets
[00:07:48] and no shooting it started yet.
[00:07:50] And I would be, you know, everyone would have this feeling.
[00:07:53] You're waiting for it to start and every step you're waiting for it to start.
[00:07:57] So it does a very, it doesn't incredible job of portraying that and giving you that feeling.
[00:08:07] Now, what's important to remember about Eugene Sledge and that's another great thing about
[00:08:14] the Pacific is that they do interviews with these guys.
[00:08:22] They do interviews with them and you can see when you watch this, you will see that Eugene
[00:08:26] Sledge.
[00:08:27] And as I thought about how I would describe Eugene Sledge, he's, yes, he's a marine and
[00:08:33] you know, you get whatever ideas you get in your mind of what a marine is, you know,
[00:08:38] a tough guy filled with bravado.
[00:08:43] Eugene Sledge just will destroy that image because Eugene Sledge and if I think of the
[00:08:50] way I would describe him, it would be to say simply, he's a good man.
[00:08:59] And you can tell when he talks that he's an upright man and that he's a moral man and
[00:09:05] he's a gentle and a kind person.
[00:09:07] I mean, it is his gentleness and his kindness oozes out of him and he seems like and I don't
[00:09:14] use this word very often.
[00:09:17] But I will use it because this is how I would describe.
[00:09:20] He seems like a lovely human being.
[00:09:24] I mean, he just seems like a lovely person.
[00:09:30] And so as we go into this book, remember that this guy who went through this was just
[00:09:41] an absolutely incredibly good human and also an incredible warrior.
[00:09:54] And now the last podcast we talked about patent and war as I knew it and that is a
[00:10:01] genuals of view.
[00:10:02] And if you remember when we talked about when we went to Sri Lanka, that was that guy
[00:10:08] described the foot soldiers view as being a worms view because you're so in the front
[00:10:16] line that it's like a worm and that's what this is.
[00:10:18] This is a soldiers book.
[00:10:19] This is a troopers book.
[00:10:21] This is the absolute front lines.
[00:10:25] And it is a book that really unveils a lot about will and survival and the psychological
[00:10:37] nature of war and what it does to people and what people are capable of doing.
[00:10:48] And also I think it makes it very clear why we fight against evil.
[00:10:54] And I think that it's something that makes me think always about where we are in the
[00:11:01] world in a war against evil.
[00:11:10] So going back to the book.
[00:11:12] We started to move inland.
[00:11:15] We had gone only a few yards when an enemy machine gun opened up from a scrub thick
[00:11:19] it to our right.
[00:11:22] Japanese 81 mm and 90 mm mortars then opened up on us.
[00:11:26] Everyone hit the deck.
[00:11:27] I dove into a shallow crater.
[00:11:30] The company was completely pinned down.
[00:11:33] All movements ceased.
[00:11:35] The shells fell faster until I couldn't make out individual explosions.
[00:11:39] This continuous crashing rumbles with an occasional ripping sound of shrapnel tearing low
[00:11:47] through the air overhead amongst the roar.
[00:11:51] The air was murky with smoke and dust.
[00:11:53] Every muscle in my body was as tight as a piano wire.
[00:11:57] I shuttered and shook as though I were having a mild convulsion.
[00:12:03] Sweat flowed profusely.
[00:12:04] I prayed, clenched my teeth, squeezed my carbine stock and cursed the Japanese.
[00:12:10] Our lieutenant, a cape, a clousster, veteran who was nearby seemed to be in about the same
[00:12:16] shape.
[00:12:18] From the meager protection of my shallow crater, I pitted him or anyone out on that flat
[00:12:23] coral.
[00:12:25] The heavy mortar barrage went on without slacking.
[00:12:29] I thought it would never stop.
[00:12:30] I was terrified by the big shells arching down all around us.
[00:12:36] One was bound to fall directly into my hole, I thought.
[00:12:40] If any orders were passed along or if anyone yelled for a corpsman I never heard it in
[00:12:45] all the noise.
[00:12:47] It was as though I were out there on the battlefield all by myself, utterly forlorn and helpless
[00:12:53] in a tempest of violent explosions.
[00:12:57] All any man could do was sweat it out and pray for survival.
[00:13:03] It would have been sure suicide to stand up in that firestorm.
[00:13:08] Under my first barrage, the fast moving events of hitting the beach, I learned a new sensation,
[00:13:14] utter and absolute helplessness.
[00:13:17] The shelling lifted in about a half an hour, although it seemed to me to have crashed on
[00:13:21] for hours.
[00:13:22] Time had no meaning.
[00:13:26] This was particularly true when under heavy shelling.
[00:13:29] I could never judge how long it lasted.
[00:13:32] Orders then came to move up, move out and I got up, covered by a layer of coral dust.
[00:13:38] I felt like jelly and couldn't believe any of us had survived that barrage.
[00:13:48] So that feeling of helplessness and that is one of the worst things for humans,
[00:13:58] it's one of the worst human emotions, helplessness.
[00:14:05] I have experienced just a minor amount of shelling, of being murdered.
[00:14:17] It is definitely, I was in Iraq and my first deployment and we were on a fire base and
[00:14:24] we were trying to help with some sniper overwatch because this place had been being attacked.
[00:14:31] This was early in my first deployment, my first time going to war.
[00:14:38] We're thinking, hey, these guys are getting murdered.
[00:14:41] Cool, we'll go out there and kill these people out of morgue room and we'll take care.
[00:14:47] So we went out to this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and sure enough we started getting
[00:14:56] murdered and the insurgents that were firing the mortars knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:15:04] It was horrible because it was in the city and so the mortars were being shot at us
[00:15:12] from three or 400 meters away but they were from behind buildings and we could actually
[00:15:22] we could actually hear the mortars being launched.
[00:15:25] So you would hear the cring, cring, cring, you'd hear the noise and you could actually see
[00:15:32] the fire trail of the launch.
[00:15:35] So you knew.
[00:15:36] So there you are and you're sitting there and you're just waiting to get blown up and
[00:15:44] it was interesting because if you have overhead cover which means if you have some kind
[00:15:48] of a strong roof over your head, if you're inside of a building, a strong building that's
[00:15:51] made a concrete, it doesn't have to be a bunker or anything for smaller mortars.
[00:15:56] You're basically safe, you know, you're fine.
[00:16:00] And we didn't really understand that yet.
[00:16:03] So we had guys myself included that were exposed, that were outside that were on rooftops.
[00:16:09] And this is again, I want to emphasize this is nothing, this is nothing compared to what
[00:16:18] Eugene Slider just talking about.
[00:16:20] The only reason I'm bringing up is because I did experience it and my point is that even
[00:16:24] through one night where we took maybe, I don't know, maybe 10 mortar rounds in a night.
[00:16:32] It actually affected the guys a little bit one night one night and you could see it actually
[00:16:40] when we got back to our compound.
[00:16:44] We had a door on our tactical operation center that was an old piece of plywood and it
[00:16:49] somebody mounted a spring on there to keep it shut because it was hot and it was air conditioning
[00:16:52] in there and it was a strong spring.
[00:16:56] And so when you walked out and you let that go, it would slap and it would make a very
[00:16:59] loud bang.
[00:17:00] And I literally after one measly night of getting mortar, I watched guys shutter and at
[00:17:08] the slap of that noise.
[00:17:12] And so to imagine what it was like for these guys for, you know, half an hour of continuous
[00:17:20] shelling is it's just it's unbelievable and I'll tell you something else.
[00:17:27] If you go back further than that and you go to World War I where those soldiers who are
[00:17:34] in the trenches and they got bombarded for months and if you want to know what that does
[00:17:42] to a human go on to YouTube and Google World War I or go on to YouTube and search World
[00:17:51] War I shell shock and it is horrendous to see the psychological damage that it did to these
[00:18:00] guys and the worst part of it was that today we understand that we understand what it does
[00:18:10] to people psychologically and we understand that it's it's it's a psychological damage and
[00:18:19] in World War I they didn't know that so these guys that broke they were cowards they were
[00:18:30] called cowards and to think about that is sickening to me knowing that my guys after like
[00:18:40] I said a miniscule amount of receiving mortar and artillery fires, mortar fire but it's
[00:18:47] the same thing it's indirect fire that to know that that already had a little bit of effect
[00:18:53] to imagine what that did over time was was crazy and I was I got I got two moments in
[00:19:03] time that I remember that that I had the feeling of helplessness we were on I was on the
[00:19:12] rooftop and again this was in Baghdad and we had gone to the space to set up some sniper
[00:19:16] positions and help them eliminate their problem boy were we wrong so this rooftop was
[00:19:23] kind of divided up by concrete walls and to get to this to the furthest part away on the
[00:19:33] roof you had to go jump a bunch of these walls and you know you were traveling probably I
[00:19:39] don't know 50 meters across this rooftop to get to one of the corners and so I had you know
[00:19:44] I was checking the positions of all the guys and walking from position to position to see
[00:19:48] where they are and see what their field of fire was and making adjustments if needed
[00:19:52] checking with them etc so I get up to this I climb out get on the roof climb up this climb up
[00:20:01] this stairs to the roof jump a bunch of these you know little four foot walls just
[00:20:07] kind of get no over them takes two or three minutes to get and I finally get to this position
[00:20:11] where there's one of the one of the gunners has sit in there and as I get there I
[00:20:17] hear how's it going and what are you seeing we're having a little discussion and all of a sudden
[00:20:21] we hear the mortar launch shung shung shung and one of the other guys in the cartoon gets on the
[00:20:30] radio and he says he says that's three boys count them out meaning okay there's going to be three
[00:20:37] booms and again we have no overhead cover because I'm on the roof and I look at I look at the
[00:20:45] guy I'm with and he says you think we can make it back inside because you have time you know
[00:20:51] the mortar rounds going way up in the air he says do you think we can make it back inside and I said
[00:20:56] nope then he says what should we do and I said hope it doesn't land in our quadrant
[00:21:07] meaning this little area that we actually landed there we'd be dead but that's the feeling of
[00:21:11] helping us that that you have and luckily that didn't land in our quadrant I wasn't another situation
[00:21:17] this was now on the on the bagged at international airport where our base was and there was an attack
[00:21:24] on on one of the gates and we went there as a quick reaction force and we get out there
[00:21:31] and as the attacks happening and we're kind of showing up to see what we can do to help out all
[00:21:36] the sudden mortar start coming in and again I get down behind just a normal like a jersey barrier
[00:21:43] a concrete jersey barrier and it but we're in a pretty open area other than this jersey barrier
[00:21:50] and again I'm I'm hunkered down with one other seal and he looks at me and he goes what should we do
[00:21:59] and I go there's nothing we can do but sit here and suck it up and and that's really all you
[00:22:04] can do and and it's easy to look back and be like that that was funny you know but but that was
[00:22:11] that was a three minutes of mortar bombardment right and and so just to imagine the psychological
[00:22:19] trauma that these guys experienced it was it was just it's horrible to imagine and and the key
[00:22:29] point of all this I think is to to think about as as it pertains to people as it pertains to individuals
[00:22:35] as it pertains to us now to people in the civilian world what causes this intense anxiety and fear
[00:22:44] is the complete lack of control that's what causes it see what you're going to fire fighter you're
[00:22:50] getting shot at it's coming from somewhere and you can hide from it and you can get down and you can
[00:22:54] maneuver on it when it's when it's not that when it's just random death that you cannot control
[00:23:03] it's it's psychologically much much harder to deal with and thank god we didn't have to deal with it
[00:23:10] very often now again when we were in the body the guys that were over with the first the 506 on
[00:23:17] camp caragador those guys were getting more than all the time I mean they were they were feeling it
[00:23:22] you know again not as bad not world war one style but you know they were getting murdered every
[00:23:28] day there was mortars hitting the buildings so that that just randomness is what makes things so
[00:23:36] difficult those mortars when you hear that first ignition of them how long does it take to
[00:23:42] it depends on how far away they were but you know in this case it was probably like a minute
[00:23:46] maybe maybe a little less than that I'd have to sit here and think about it but it was like a minute
[00:23:50] maybe 30 seconds it might have been it might have been long it might have been shorter than that but it
[00:23:54] seemed like a lot because you're sitting there waiting for it to hit you and that was another
[00:23:58] I on the one that was in Baghdad I was sitting there in a home v and we had this we had weapons on
[00:24:06] the home v that could reach across the river so we were by a river and we were looking we could see
[00:24:12] some activity over across the river and so as we sat there are gunner I said hey can you see this
[00:24:18] and he's like yeah I can I can kind of see it and I go do you have a shot and he goes no
[00:24:21] because we were behind a behind a it bunk some kind of wall I go do you have a shot and he goes no I
[00:24:28] can't I don't have a shot yet so I said hey pull the home v forward so I told the driver we pull the
[00:24:33] home v forward like I don't know 30 feet maybe 35 feet and a minute later a mortar hit exactly
[00:24:42] where that one was luckily was only a 60 millimeter which is a tiny little tiny little mortar
[00:24:48] and no one even got fracked but I mean you know we were we were 30 seconds away or a minute away
[00:24:54] from just taking a mortar round right in the home v that we were all in so it's it's it's again I don't
[00:25:05] want to put anything that I experienced on any level with what these guys experienced the only
[00:25:12] reason I'm saying is to give a miniscule psychological impact that it has and just multiply that
[00:25:19] time is a billion to get to where these guys were and and what they went through so going back to
[00:25:28] the book here after the fighting it kind of settled um sledge Eugene sledge comes across some
[00:25:37] dead Japanese soldiers so now they're kind of patrolling and there's some other veterans that
[00:25:44] were with them and he's standing there looking at these dead Japanese bodies and a guy comes over and
[00:25:51] says sledgehammer don't stand there with your mouth open when there's all these good souvenirs laying
[00:25:57] around so he sees these dead Japanese and he's going to get some war booty he then removed a
[00:26:03] nambu pistol slipped the belt off the corpse and took the leather holster he pulled off the steel helmet
[00:26:10] reached inside and took out a neatly folded Japanese flag covered it with writing the veteran
[00:26:16] pitched the helmet on the coral where it clanked and rattled rolled the corpse over and started
[00:26:22] pulling through the combat pack the veterans buddy came up and started stripping the other Japanese
[00:26:28] corpses his take was a flag and other items he then removed the bolts from the Japanese
[00:26:33] rifles and broke the stocks against the coral to render them useless to infiltrators
[00:26:39] I hadn't budged or said a word just stood glued to the spot almost in a trance
[00:26:45] the corpses were sprawled where the veterans had dragged them around to get into their packs and pockets
[00:26:52] would I become this casual and calist about enemy dead I wondered would the war dehumanize me
[00:27:00] so that I too could feel strip enemy dead with such non-shalance the time soon came when it
[00:27:09] didn't bother me a bit I think again it's it's important to remember that this guy is a gentleman
[00:27:19] a kind soul and he knows and he's admitting that it came to a point where this this did not bother him at all
[00:27:27] back to the book within a few yards of this scene one of our hospital corpsmen worked in a small
[00:27:34] shallow deathdevil defile treating Marine wounded I went over and sat on the hot coral by him
[00:27:45] the corpsmen was on his knees bending over to young marine who just died on a stretcher a blood-soaked
[00:27:51] battle dressing was on the side of the Marines of the dead man's neck his fine handsome boy's face was
[00:27:59] asian what a pitiful waste I thought he can't be a day over 17 years old I think God his mother couldn't
[00:28:06] see him the corpsmen held the dead Marines chin tenderly between the thumb and fingers of his
[00:28:12] left hand and made the sign of the cross with his right hand tears streamed down his dusty,
[00:28:20] tanned grief-contorted face while he sobbed quietly obviously again we have a vision in our mind of what
[00:28:43] a service men is like what a marine is like and certainly that picture of a corpsmen which is
[00:28:59] actually a navy corpsmen if you don't know navy corpsmen work with the Marines and go into the
[00:29:03] field with Marines and train as Marines but you picture this navy corpsmen in trying to treat
[00:29:13] this man and losing him and out there in the middle of the battlefield battle field with tears
[00:29:18] streaming down his face that's what combat is moving to another section where you're about to see
[00:29:37] some near friendly fire here it is just then a marine tank took to our rear
[00:29:44] I'm sorry just then a marine tank to our rear mist took us for enemy troops as soon as my
[00:29:51] hand went up to drop the round down the tube a machine gun cut loose it sounded like one of ours
[00:29:57] and from the rear of all places as I peeped over the edge of the crater through the dust and smoke
[00:30:02] and saw Sherman tank in the clearing behind us the tank fired at 75 millimeter gun off to our right
[00:30:08] rear the shell exploded nearby around a bend in the same trail we were on I then heard the report
[00:30:15] of a Japanese field gun located there as it returned fire on the tank again I tried to fire
[00:30:21] but the machine gun opened up on us as before a surge of panic rose within me in a brief moment
[00:30:28] our tank had reduced me to from a well-trained determined assistant mortar gunner to a quivering
[00:30:35] mass of terror it was not just that I was being fired at by a machine gun that unnerved me so
[00:30:42] terribly but that it was one of ours to be killed by the enemy was bad enough that was a real
[00:30:49] possibility I had prepared myself for but to be killed by a mistake by my own comrades was something
[00:30:56] I found hard to accept it was just too much and that is what we call a blue on blue
[00:31:03] when friendlies shoot at friendlies and fraturicide is what it's called when brother kills brother
[00:31:13] and you know this is actually the opening of the book that late for my road extreme ownership
[00:31:22] the opening chapter is about this this happening and happening under my command to my guys
[00:31:31] when I'm the senior guy and that's why this idea that to be killed by mistake by my own comrades
[00:31:42] was something I found hard to accept this is the this is the mortal sin of combat
[00:31:49] and sometimes when I talk about my deployment to Ramadi and what it was like for us I say that
[00:31:56] basically every bad thing that could happen happened and this is definitely one of them
[00:32:05] is being in a situation where there was friendly fire and we were a number of situations like
[00:32:10] this none of them was bad as as the first one I talk about in the book and here's how these
[00:32:15] guys get it solved a volunteer crawled off to the left and soon the tanks ceased firing on us
[00:32:22] we learned later that our tankers were firing on us because we had moved too far ahead
[00:32:28] they thought we were enemy support for the field gun this also explained why the enemy
[00:32:34] shelling was passing over and exploding behind us tragically the marine who saved us by identifying
[00:32:41] us to the tanker was shot off the tank and killed by a sniper definitely one of the worst things in
[00:32:48] war you think you after worry about the enemy and things are so confusing and there's such
[00:32:55] mayhem out there that you you have to spend at least as much time if not more
[00:33:01] de-conflicting with your friendly troops as you do trying to figure out where the enemy is and
[00:33:06] killed them and it's it's it was definitely a fast learning curve for us in Ramadi learning and
[00:33:14] understanding and de-conflicting and wanting to be so absolutely certain of where everybody was
[00:33:25] and the term we would use and is used in military's front line trace where are your guys
[00:33:30] where is the most forward that they are and everybody needs to know that in fact and this might sound
[00:33:37] crazy so we'd have you know people have in their minds of a sniper position being you know two or three
[00:33:44] guys hidden very tactically and clandestine in Ramadi sometimes for our sniper overwatch position
[00:33:53] first of all sometimes we have 20 or 30 guys in there to secure a building so that the snipers
[00:33:59] and the machine gunners could work but on top of that in order to avoid there being a blue on blue
[00:34:05] we had giant aircraft marking panels so fluorescent orange 10 by 10 pieces of material that we
[00:34:16] would literally the guys would literally hang them over the side of the Overwatch positions to say
[00:34:21] here we are everyone don't shoot us oh bad guys you want to shoot us bring it and we'll kill you
[00:34:28] but that's that's the extent that that we would go to to ensure that you weren't going to get shot
[00:34:35] by American forces and there's you know life's got a a vignette in the book as well a story about
[00:34:42] that almost happening and I tell another one that that blue on blue stuff was a nightmare
[00:34:47] it was a nightmare to deal with and you know one thing I will say is we had that horrible
[00:34:53] one that resulted in an in an Iraqi soldier killed a friendly Iraqi soldier killed very early on in
[00:34:59] our deployment but we learned so much from it that we there was blue on blues that happened after
[00:35:04] that but then we never had them get out of control like that first event but again for those
[00:35:13] people that have never been in combat before and it was weird when life and I were writing the book
[00:35:17] you know we got done I said man we've got three stories that are based on some sort of blue on
[00:35:22] blue happening and we didn't plan it that way but again just to realize you know that's that's how
[00:35:29] much we were thinking about it that when we wrote about it three of the stories were just about hey
[00:35:35] preventing blue on blues having a blue on blue and then two of them were not preventing blue on blues
[00:35:40] and if you'd never been in a combat you would you would think about that it's so confusing
[00:35:47] it's so confusing that there were situations in Romadi where humvies fired on other humvies
[00:35:55] so so this is an American vehicle and it's not like the the insurgents had humvies I mean
[00:36:02] humvies a very distinctive looking vehicle and there were situations where in the confusion in the
[00:36:07] mayhem and with you know muzzle flashes humvies shot at other humvies that's how that's how crazy
[00:36:15] and chaotic combat can get back to the book moving forward and this is gonna go back into the
[00:36:26] shelling and I almost wasn't gonna talk about this but I had to there was nothing subtle or intimate
[00:36:35] about the approach and explosion of an artillery shell when I heard the whistle of an approaching one
[00:36:42] in the distance every muzzle in my body contracted I braised myself in a puny effort to keep from
[00:36:49] being swept away I felt utterly helpless as the fiendish whistle grew louder my teeth ground
[00:36:58] against each other my heart pounded my mouth dried my eyes narrowed sweat poured over me my breath
[00:37:06] came in short irregular gaskets and I was afraid to swallow less tight choke I always prayed
[00:37:14] sometimes out loud under certain conditions of range and terrain I could hear the shell approaching
[00:37:21] from a considerable distance thus prolonging this suspense into seemingly unending torture
[00:37:30] at the instant the voice of the shell grew the loudest it terminated in a flash and a deafening
[00:37:35] explosion similar to the crash of a loud clap of thunder the ground shook in the concussion hurt my
[00:37:42] ears shell fragments tore through the air tore the air apart as they rushed out worrying and
[00:37:49] ripping rocks and dirt clattered onto the deck as a smoke of the exploded shell dissipated
[00:37:57] and this is something I need to point out when you went when I when I before I was ever in combat
[00:38:06] and ever saw what mortars really did when you think of shrapnel and people think of shrapnel
[00:38:12] like how big do you think a piece of shrapnel is just take a guess so echo's actually
[00:38:19] a half two inches echo's holding up inch and a half two inches I actually thought smaller than that
[00:38:23] I thought you know what it's a little tiny thing and you get a scared to get to watch out these
[00:38:27] little tiny things on bigger artillery shells or mortar shells the the frag that comes off of them
[00:38:38] is a half an inch thick and it can be nine inches long 12 inches long jagged
[00:38:48] shards of metal you know they're just evil and and and that's why I would scary is the
[00:38:56] shrapnel oh yeah it can it can hit you and like puncture you like a bullet but it can also take
[00:39:02] your leg clean off or take your arm clean off or just just completely I mean just kill you instantly
[00:39:07] if it hits you in the torso but it's a it's a limb remover so it's much more horrifying than
[00:39:14] than than whatever envisioned it to be and and the reason the one of the reasons this sticks in my
[00:39:20] mind so well as getting morgard we were at in combat outpost falcon in downtown Ramadi we took
[00:39:28] some hundred twenty millimeter mortar shells in there and we you know the the company commander
[00:39:33] who was an awesome unbelievable guy he brought in a piece of frack and the thing I couldn't
[00:39:40] believe it when I saw it I was shocked at how huge it was he made a piece of like a random piece
[00:39:45] of the frack that had come off the mortar shells yeah blew off and you know bounced down the street
[00:39:50] didn't hit anybody and he picked it up and brought it in and said here's what's flying around the
[00:39:54] air wait so are these things that they load into the to the shell on the shell is the shell is
[00:40:01] in paste in metal and that's what the metal's for that when it blows up it just hits apart and
[00:40:06] gets people yeah you think when like when you see on TV about these I don't know these criminals
[00:40:11] or whatever they set pipe bombs yeah they put the down nails nails screws you think so this is like
[00:40:17] that times 10 yeah it's big and it's it's freaking horrifying dang that's another one I remember
[00:40:25] one of those same situation got hit with some mortars in cop falcon and laaf and his team were like
[00:40:35] 300 meters away on a rooftop of a building and frack landed on them you know it didn't have the
[00:40:43] velocity to hurt anybody but it was raining down on them so it's probably a hot too oh yeah
[00:40:49] yeah horrible back to the book to be under a barrage of prolonged shelling simply magnified
[00:40:57] all the terrible physical and emotional effects of one shell to me our territory was an
[00:41:04] invention of hell the on rushing whistle and scream of the big steel package of destruction was
[00:41:11] the pinnacle of violent fury and the embodiment of pent up evil it was the essence of violence
[00:41:20] and of man's in humanity to man I developed a passion a passionate hatred for shells to be killed
[00:41:27] by a bullet seemed so clean and surgical but shells would not only tear and rip the body they tortured
[00:41:35] ones mind almost beyond the brink of sanity after each shell was run out after each shell I was
[00:41:44] run out limp and exhausted during prolonged shelling I often had to restrain myself and fight back
[00:41:52] a wild inexorable urge to scream to sob and to cry as pelu dragged on I feared that if I ever
[00:42:00] lost control of myself under shell fire my mind would be shattered I hated shells as much for
[00:42:08] their damage to the mind as to the body to be under heavy shell fire was to me by far the most
[00:42:15] terrifying combat experiences each time it left me feeling more for Lauren and helpless more fatalistic
[00:42:24] and with less confidence that I could escape the dreadful law of averages that reduced our numbers
[00:42:32] fear is many fasted and has many subtle nuances but the terror and desperation endured under heavy
[00:42:40] shell are by far the most unbearable and I think again the key point of that if you want to take
[00:42:51] something from that and apply it to life because most people that are listening to this podcast
[00:42:59] won't have to endure shelling other than those troopers that are out there on the front lines
[00:43:04] today God bless them those guys are out there they may have to deal with us and they will but for
[00:43:14] civilians from normal people it's the feeling of helplessness it's the feeling of lack of control
[00:43:20] that makes it so horrifying and so when you come up against things that you cannot control that's
[00:43:29] something to recognize that it is something that you cannot control that's what's scaring you that's
[00:43:35] what the fear is coming from and making it infinitely worse than something that you can control yeah
[00:43:43] you know another thing that they had to help them deal with the fear was the camaraderie
[00:43:59] and he talks a little bit about this talking about his company I realized that company k will
[00:44:06] killo I realized that company k had become my home no matter how bad a situation was in the company
[00:44:15] it was still home to me it was not just a lettered company in a numbered battalion in a number
[00:44:20] regiment in a numbered division it meant far more than that it was home it was my company I belonged
[00:44:29] in it and nowhere else most Marines I knew felt the same about their companies in whatever battalion
[00:44:37] regiment or marine division they happened to be in this was the result of or maybe a cause for
[00:44:43] our strong aspreet a core the Marine Corps wisely acknowledged this unit attachment
[00:44:49] men who recovered from wounds and returned to duty nearly always came home to their old company
[00:44:55] this was not misplaced sentimentality but a strong contributor to high morale a man felt that
[00:45:03] he belonged to his unit and had a niche among his buddies whom he knew and with whom he shared a mutual
[00:45:11] respect well didn't combat this sense of family was particularly important in the infantry
[00:45:18] where survival and combat efficiency often hinged on how well men could depend on one another
[00:45:30] a spree decor and now there's a section that I'm moving forward to
[00:45:36] and this section is called the stench of battle the sun board down on us like a giant heat lamp
[00:45:49] occasional rains fell on the hot coral merely evaporated like steam off hot pavement
[00:45:55] the air hung heavy and muggy everywhere we went on the ridges the hot humid air
[00:46:02] weaked with the stench of death a strong wind was no relief it simply brought the horned odor
[00:46:10] from an adjacent area Japanese corpses lay where they fell among the rocks and on the slopes
[00:46:16] it was impossible to cover them usually there was no soil that could be spated over them
[00:46:22] just the hard jagged coral the enemy dead simply rotted where they had fallen they lay all over
[00:46:30] the place in grotesque positions with puffy faces and grinning buck tooth expressions
[00:46:37] it was difficult to convey to anyone who is not experienced it the gassly horror of having
[00:46:42] your sense of smell saturated constantly with the putrid odor of rotting human flesh day after day
[00:46:50] night after night this was something the men of an infantry battalion got a horrifying dose of
[00:46:57] during the long protracted battle such as pelaloo in the tropics the dead became bloated and
[00:47:04] gave off a terrific stench within a few hours after death whenever possible we removed marine dead
[00:47:14] to the rear of the company's position there they were usually laid on stretchers and covered with
[00:47:19] ponchoes which stretched over the head of the corpse down to the ankles I rarely saw a dead
[00:47:25] marine left uncovered with his face exposed to the sun rain and flies somehow it seemed
[00:47:31] indecent not to cover our dead often though the dead might lie on the stretchers for some time
[00:47:39] and decompose badly before the busy grave registration crews could take them for burial
[00:47:45] in the division cemetery near the airfield added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides
[00:47:53] was the repulsive odor of human excrement everywhere it was all but impossible to practice simple
[00:48:00] elemental field sanitation on most areas of pelaloo because of the rocky surface
[00:48:06] field sanitation during maneuvers in combat was the responsibility of each man
[00:48:11] in short under normal conditions he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil
[00:48:16] at night when he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole he simply used to
[00:48:21] empty grenade can't destroy a ration cans and threw it out of his hole and scooped
[00:48:24] over it the next day if he wasn't under enemy fire that was not possible on pelaloo
[00:48:34] added to this was the odor of thousands of rotting discarded japanese and american rations
[00:48:41] at every breath one inhaled humid air heavy with countless repulsive odors I felt as though my
[00:48:49] lungs would never be cleansed of these valve vapors as I looked at the stains on the coral
[00:49:00] I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how gallant it was for a man
[00:49:09] to shed his blood for his country and to give life's blood for sacrifice and so on
[00:49:15] the word seemed so ridiculous only the fly is benefited so as patriotic and brave
[00:49:30] as Eugene sledge was the madness the madness even made him begin to question what this
[00:49:42] was all about and think about what these politicians would say and say that only the fly is benefited
[00:49:57] it's crazy how he went so detailed in the in the smells
[00:50:04] because you know when you watch movies and that's a part that you don't do it
[00:50:08] I'll try and everyone's in the guise covering his nose or something that indicate this smells bad
[00:50:13] but that doesn't stick in your mind the whole time maybe if they add like flies or something
[00:50:20] but how he illustrated how this was going on to the point where I never thought I'd ever catch a
[00:50:28] fresh breath you know basically this is going to stand it really adds that element of hell you know
[00:50:36] and they say that smell is one of the most impactful senses you have that can like spark memories
[00:50:42] the strong is you know no doubt about it and there's there is a smell there's a smell in Iraq obviously
[00:50:47] wasn't as bad as this but it was it's it's a bad smell yeah and for sure when something hits me
[00:50:55] if you're in a you know a strange place or a place where there's no it's not sanitary
[00:51:01] you can get that momentary remembrance of that smell yeah and this section called the stench
[00:51:11] combat is beyond just the smell which we'll get into now the grinding stress of prolonged heavy combat
[00:51:23] the loss of sleep because of night nightly infiltration raids
[00:51:26] the vigorous physical demands forced on us by the rugged terrain and the unrelenting
[00:51:35] suffocating heat were enough to make us drop in our tracks how we kept going and continue fighting
[00:51:42] I'll never know I was so indescribably weary physically and emotionally that I became fatalistic
[00:51:51] praying only for my fate to be painless thinking he's going to die and there's only prayer is that
[00:52:00] it's painless yeah that's three to believe in it like you know you're gonna die
[00:52:06] in addition to the terror and hardships of combat each day brought some new dimension of dread for me
[00:52:13] I witnessed some new ghastly macrob facet in the kaleidoscope of the unreal
[00:52:19] as though designed by some fiendish ghoul to cause even the most hardened and
[00:52:25] calloused observer among us to recoil and horror and disbelief
[00:52:34] late one afternoon a buddy and I returned from the gun pit in the fading light
[00:52:41] we passed a shallow deflade we hadn't noticed previously in it we're three marine dead
[00:52:47] they were lying on stretchers where they had died before their comrades had been forced to
[00:52:51] withdraw some time earlier as we moved past my buddy groaned Jesus I took a quick glance into the
[00:53:00] depression and recoil and revulsion and pity at what I saw the bodies were so badly decomposed
[00:53:09] and nearly blackened by exposure this was to be expected of the dead and the tropics
[00:53:14] but these marines had been mutilated hideously by the enemy one man had been
[00:53:21] decapitated his head lay on his chest his hands had been severed from his wrists
[00:53:27] and also lay on his chest near his chin in disbelief I stared at the face as I realized
[00:53:35] that the Japanese had cut off the dead marines penis and stuff that into his mouth
[00:53:40] the corpse next to him had been treated similarly the third had been butchered
[00:53:47] chopped up like a carcass torn apart by some predatory animal my emotions solidified into rage
[00:53:56] and to hatred for the Japanese beyond anything I had ever experienced from that moment on
[00:54:02] I never felt the least pity or compassion for them no matter what the circumstances my comrades
[00:54:10] would feel stripped their packs and pockets for souvenirs and take gold teeth but I never saw
[00:54:16] marine commit that kind of barbaric mutilation that the Japanese committed if they had access to
[00:54:23] our dead like I said it's a glimpse into the darkest part of humanity and I want people to think
[00:54:42] about that and remember that it's real it's real that dark part of humanity that we don't want
[00:54:54] to exist it exists evil exists and this is coming from a guy you know when he says that he never had
[00:55:09] any pity after this again and you if you go and watch the Pacific and you watch interviews with
[00:55:19] this guy you can absolutely feel like I said the the kindness oozes out of him but even he
[00:55:30] when confronting the darkness had to explore his own darkness and I'm jumping now to the end
[00:55:49] on August 8th we heard that the first atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan
[00:56:02] reports abound for a week about a possible surrender then on 15 August 1945 the war ended
[00:56:12] we received news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief
[00:56:21] we thought the Japanese would never surrender many refused to believe it
[00:56:28] sitting in stunned silence we remembered our dead so many dead so many maimed so many bright
[00:56:39] futures consigned to the ashes of the past so many dreams lost in the madness that
[00:56:47] didn't gulf us except for a few widely scattered shouts of joy the survivors of the abyss
[00:56:56] sat hollow wide and silent trying to comprehend a world without war war is brutish
[00:57:08] in glorious and a terrible waste combat leaves and indelible mark on those who are forced to
[00:57:17] endure it the only redeeming factors were my comrades incredible bravery and their devotion to
[00:57:26] each other marine court training taught us to kill efficiently and to try to survive
[00:57:32] but it also taught us loyalty to each other and love that a spree decor sustained us
[00:57:45] until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others it will be necessary to
[00:57:51] accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make sacrifices for one's countries as my comrades did
[00:57:58] as the troops used to say if the country is good enough to live in it's good enough to fight for
[00:58:07] with privilege goes responsibility and that is another look at war
[00:58:19] and it's something that we can't ever forget that war is awful and that war is the darkness that
[00:58:35] I talk about and as Eugene Sledge says the only redeeming factor is the incredible bravery and
[00:58:49] devotion to each other and I've talked about that before what made war to me
[00:58:58] an incredibly life-altering experience it wasn't the darkness that I saw but the light of the bravery
[00:59:13] of those on the battlefield and I will add another redeeming quality to war
[00:59:19] and it's a question and that is what is the alternative so what if we had not stopped the brutal
[00:59:31] imperial Japanese empire what if we had not stopped the Nazis what if we had not fought a war against
[00:59:41] ourselves to enslave and today there's still evil in the world there's still darkness
[00:59:51] ISIS the cult of child rapists and sadists and torturers and murders and if we don't confront that evil
[01:00:05] and that evil goes unchecked the darkness prevails so we have to be a force of light against the
[01:00:18] darkness and as Eugene Sledge transformed partially in his brain we have to use the darkness and
[01:00:30] the evil ourselves to prevail that's the paradox and we have to remember that when men get so close to evil
[01:00:44] it leaves a mark and it leaves a scar and we must forgive them their trespasses and help them to
[01:00:54] heal if they need it so to the men and women who are fighting or who have fought against forces of
[01:01:03] evil in the world thank you if we were gonna dive into that to apply or think about that in context of
[01:01:19] normal people I would say just remember how horrible things can be and and enjoy that sunrise in the
[01:01:38] morning again that book is called with the old breed by Eugene Sledge and I hit some highlights
[01:01:50] but the entire book is incredible the HBO many series is called the Pacific watch it it's incredible
[01:02:01] and remember remember remember remember
[01:02:18] all right let's get to some questions some questions from the intro webs
[01:02:25] yes in that question okay and by the way there's been late in the game but good evening echo Charles
[01:02:32] good evening and thanks for joining thanks yeah I don't know when I start timing in no I'll get
[01:02:39] with with a book like this I mean I'm coming over here to the studio and it is in my mind I'm
[01:02:47] fired up and and I picture when I want to listen to a podcast I want to sit down I want to
[01:02:58] put the headphones on I want to press play and I want to get it I want to get after it I want
[01:03:05] something to get in my brain and start to make me think and that's what I was tonight when I got
[01:03:12] on track I said I said hey this is the this is the podcast and here we go and I just went into it
[01:03:19] yeah no you know there was no echo Charles in my brain at that note I know offense no no no no I
[01:03:25] don't want to be in your brain Brad do you think I like to listen anyway I don't know when
[01:03:29] a time in in fact I do know into time in one I have a question that's true that's true
[01:03:34] there's no reason so no I'll hear you say hey echo oh oh oh oh how's it going yeah let's cut
[01:03:42] out the small talk and let's get down to business we can small talk now now that I've released
[01:03:48] the the passion that I had and I was had brewing up in my brain because get remember I'm
[01:03:57] prepping these things so I'm going through this book for a week or two and I'm delving into it
[01:04:03] and I'm doing other watching YouTube videos of the bell-o-lou battle it's in my brain and it's
[01:04:09] wanting to get it's wanting to come out yeah yeah really so you just get trumped by that no offense
[01:04:17] nope none taken alright questions jocco how do you balance extreme ownership
[01:04:27] with holding others accountable for their actions and avoiding them using you so this is actually
[01:04:35] a question that I end up responding to on a fairly regular basis and there's really a couple
[01:04:42] different angles here that are going on the one of the the points here is the balance of extreme
[01:04:50] ownership versus holding others accountable and what that really means and or what another
[01:04:56] way of looking at that is it's really extreme ownership versus decentralized command so decentralized
[01:05:04] command is it's one of the laws of combat that life and I write about in the book decentralized command
[01:05:13] and what that means is everybody leads that means everybody's a leader and that's what you want
[01:05:18] and that is a that is a the complete opposite of extreme ownership so if extreme ownership
[01:05:26] I'm gonna own everything decentralized command is I'm gonna let everyone else lead so there's a real
[01:05:33] a real contradiction a real dichotomy there so what you have to do is balance it you have to balance
[01:05:41] that's the only way to to sort of rectify or or reconcile those two opposing forces
[01:05:50] because you do you do have to have extreme ownership of everything that is true and at the same
[01:05:56] time you have to have decentralized command because you can't be everywhere once and you have to
[01:05:59] let your frontline leaders lead so you have to balance them so that's one part of it is that you
[01:06:09] should if you feel yourself for instance if you feel like you can't get everything done and you're
[01:06:15] losing control or you're you're not able to execute everything because there's too much on your
[01:06:21] plate it means that you're not delegating enough it means that you're not your frontline
[01:06:26] troopers aren't stepping up and leading now so you've gone too far in one direction now if your
[01:06:33] leaders or if all of a sudden you're having to tell your leaders like hey you need to get this
[01:06:39] done hey what are you doing why aren't you taking initiative then that means you've gone too far
[01:06:43] in the other direction so you have to find the good balance and that's the that's the goal and
[01:06:47] again and I'll say it over and over again that's what makes leadership hard leadership the hardest
[01:06:52] thing about leadership is that there's opposing forces that you have to balance and if you could just
[01:06:57] pick the extreme and go with it and that made you a good leader anyone could do it but it's not it's
[01:07:01] it's the balance that makes you a good leader it's the balance that's challenging so now the other
[01:07:09] word so that's part of the question the other word is accountability and holding people accountable
[01:07:18] for their actions now this is where I'm gonna throw something out that people are not going to
[01:07:26] expect me to say because people always talk about accountability and I hear that all the time in
[01:07:34] businesses and they say yeah we really need accountability accountability accountability and years
[01:07:41] the issue I have with that you don't want to have to rely on accountability accountability
[01:07:51] is actually a grudge it's a tool and I'm not saying you never use it because sometimes you do have to
[01:07:58] use it you have to implement it if people aren't doing what they're supposed to do you have to hold
[01:08:01] them accountable but I will tell you this what you what you don't want is people that are doing
[01:08:10] their job only because you're holding them accountable that's not what you want you want people that
[01:08:18] take initiative and ownership of their job and they do it not because you want them to or because
[01:08:24] you're going to inspect them they do it because they own it they take extreme ownership of it that's
[01:08:32] what you want so if you were to ask people that work for me if I held them accountable and they would be like
[01:08:41] hmm not really I mean for instance weapons inspections so you know I'm in charge of a
[01:08:50] platoon or I'm in charge of a task unit and there's you know a couple hundred weapons or whatever a bunch of
[01:08:56] weapons and if you don't take care of those weapons and people don't maintain them and clean them and
[01:09:03] lubricate them properly they can rust very easily and so you know one of the things that you may have to do is
[01:09:10] do weapons inspections to make sure that my guys are cleaning their weapons and I can tell you
[01:09:18] I rarely if ever conducted actual weapons inspections the reason my guys my guys did it my guys
[01:09:32] owned it my guys wanted to be the best they wanted to always have the best possible reputation
[01:09:40] and so I don't have to go around inspecting their weapons because I knew that they were going to do it
[01:09:47] I knew that that my guys who were on board who understood why we were doing what we were doing
[01:09:55] who understood that we wanted to be the best and who were on board with trying to be the best
[01:10:01] said you know what you know we are going to make sure these weapons are the best possible and I learned this
[01:10:08] when I was in my second platoon my boss was an awesome guy and this is a guy that I've talked about
[01:10:15] before he was huge influence on me he was a prior enlisted seal who became an officer he was a combat
[01:10:23] veteran from the warnernada and he was a very humble guy and he's actually the guy that inspired me to
[01:10:31] become an officer because I said to myself well this guy is this guy made our lives so good maybe I could
[01:10:37] do that for 16 guys and a platoon someday but what I realized about him is he never held us accountable
[01:10:45] for anything but at the same time he infused accountability on us because what we wanted more than
[01:10:53] anything else was to do a good job for him and for them platoon that's that's how you get troops
[01:11:02] and teams aligned not by holding them accountable with imposed accountability but where they are
[01:11:11] inspired themselves to hold themselves accountable and I had a coaching call with a team the other
[01:11:19] day that was they were saying hey you know we really we would like to have you you know coach us
[01:11:26] because we're lacking in these areas and we really need we know what to do but we really need someone
[01:11:32] to hold us accountable to do it and I I was like listen I charge a lot of money and you guys would
[01:11:43] be stupid to give it to me you guys just simply lack the discipline to work for the team and make
[01:11:51] it happen and I threw this example I said you know if you're competing against another team and
[01:11:57] what I did was I moved into your house and I woke you up in the morning and I held you accountable
[01:12:01] for what you're supposed to do and I made you do it so we put the ultimate in accountability on top
[01:12:06] of them I said who would do better you guys with me waking you up in the morning and
[01:12:13] beating you until you accomplish what you're supposed to do I held you to the up the highest
[01:12:18] standard of accountability or a team that was hungry themselves that was going to go the extra
[01:12:27] mile that was going to do more work it was going to stay up later that was going to get up earlier
[01:12:31] not because somebody was holding them accountable but because they had the desire for victory
[01:12:39] who's going to win that contest and the answer is very simple those with the innate and intrinsic
[01:12:46] desire to win will win over those that have imposed discipline and accountability put on top of them
[01:12:54] yeah now because there's a dichotomy to everything and because there's a balanced everything
[01:12:59] there are times where an leadership position you do need to inspect and make sure that you
[01:13:06] hold people accountable and an example I have that is we had when we got to Ramani we had our
[01:13:11] radios and generally the radio men knew how to program the radios and and get them synced up so
[01:13:18] they could talk to other radios and all that and I told the guys I'm like listen everybody in the
[01:13:23] troop needs to know how to program your radio yourself and everyone says oh okay and
[01:13:32] it was so critical that they know how to program these radios because if you're out in the field
[01:13:36] and you get separated from your unit and all of a sudden your radio gets zeroized or it has a
[01:13:41] problem and you don't know how to fix it yourself what are you going to do you can't talk to anybody
[01:13:44] and you're doomed you're going to die so because it was that critical I actually after the first
[01:13:50] briefing I called a couple guys up and I said give me a radio and I zeroized their radios and I said okay
[01:13:57] reprogram it now and couple didn't know how to do it and I said okay listen up guys no one is going
[01:14:04] on operation if you can't reprogram your radio and so the guys had to sit down and go and figure
[01:14:09] how to do it so there's times where you you do have to hold people accountable and in that situation
[01:14:14] I knew that even though I was saying hey it's important they didn't realize how important it was
[01:14:20] because you know it was oh you got to know how to work your gear they kind of took it like that I
[01:14:23] knew that guys didn't really understand the nature of how important it was to be able to
[01:14:28] operate and reprogram your entire radio and sync it with the army radio and all that I knew that
[01:14:34] they didn't quite understand how important it was and so I had to I had to hold them accountable
[01:14:39] but generally 98% of the stuff I didn't have to hold people accountable I didn't inspect things I
[01:14:47] expected things and they delivered and and that's that's people will follow your lead if you take
[01:14:58] ownership that's how my guys have always been they've always seen that and and known what the
[01:15:08] expectations were and finally if if you're sitting there and you keep saying to yourself I
[01:15:15] got to hold people accountable I got to hold people accountable most likely you don't need to hold
[01:15:21] them accountable you need to lead them you need to make them understand why they're doing what they're
[01:15:29] doing why it's important how it impacts the strategic mission how it impacts the team how it impacts
[01:15:36] them that's leadership not accountability it's leadership accountability is just a tool and it
[01:15:44] is a it's a crude tool compared to real leadership so use it if you have to but try and use
[01:15:56] leadership instead next question juggle I'm entering the police academy in a few short weeks
[01:16:10] and I'll be a police officer after six months I have no military background and have very little
[01:16:16] experience with true confrontation in violence one of the best ways of police officer can condition
[01:16:22] themselves to violence and confrontation I currently change it to but I'm not I am but I am curious
[01:16:29] what else I can do to keep myself and others safe from unpredictable violence this is not a self-defense
[01:16:35] question or either a mental condition in question very cool question I appreciate that question
[01:16:44] because this individual recognizes that there's a little bit more to it than just the physical
[01:16:51] self defense and that's the mental and he's 100% right so here's some things that you can do
[01:16:57] when you get the opportunity you got to get some realistic training going and I've talked about
[01:17:08] a little bit on here with a kind of realistic training that we did in the SEAL teams there's things
[01:17:13] that up the intensity greatly some ammunition or like a paintball scenario another good thing is getting
[01:17:21] you know it's really heavy sparring equipment on so face gear you know and really go to town
[01:17:29] where you're trying to attack someone and take them down and do it you know three on one four on one
[01:17:36] gotta be careful not to get hurt you don't go that extreme but if someone puts on head gear you know
[01:17:42] with a face mask and a whole nine yards shin guards and padded out fit on and people can attack them
[01:17:51] and you have to react to it the other good thing to do is do it in a situation where you know you don't
[01:17:56] let the guy know what's gonna happen you know he's got to keep his eyes closed until you say go
[01:18:00] when he opens his eyes there's someone there where the knife right in front of a fake knife right in
[01:18:03] front of him is gonna stab when he's got a draws weapon and shoot or defend himself somehow so you want to
[01:18:09] hit him with these unexpected drills with your weapons without your weapon shooting and moving so those
[01:18:16] those are those are the kind of things as soon as you get the opportunity to do it and it's even good I
[01:18:19] mean if you've been in a in a in a in a in a shooting drill with like a barricade a shooter which is
[01:18:29] you know you put a shooter at the end of a hallway and he's hidden but he's shooting at you with paintball
[01:18:34] and you get you get the intensity up very high it's getting shot with paintball hurts and if you're
[01:18:39] getting nailed and you've got to do something and people are like I got to make all go do something you
[01:18:43] got to make it happen how you're gonna stop this guy you can get your intensity up and you can get used to that
[01:18:48] you can inoculate yourself someone to that stress and learn to detach yourself from it and not let it affect you
[01:18:57] and not let it grind on you so that's the realistic training and honestly I when I watch
[01:19:06] some of the police videos of the bad shootings now we know police officers throughout the country
[01:19:15] every day are under a burden of hostility and they do an outstanding job over and over again
[01:19:25] making great arrests and helping people and saving people that are suicidal incredible amount of things right
[01:19:31] of course no one releases those videos and they don't go viral the videos that go viral
[01:19:37] and the videos that people watch are the bad ones the bad ones and I hope that the police departments
[01:19:47] across America are doing something to inoculate their troopers from the stress because
[01:19:54] that when I watch these videos that is what I see happening the the stress level and the the
[01:20:04] inexperience of the stressful situation and there's one video that I watched which is awful
[01:20:12] and the guy gets a call you see is you see his the first thing you see oh no it's the whole thing
[01:20:19] is a body camera and and forgive me if someone pulls this video up and I'm not 100% accurate but
[01:20:23] he gets a call it's at a 7-11 guy with a gun guy pulls a new 7-11 the cop pulls into the 7-11
[01:20:30] as he gets out of his car and he sees a guy kind of walking one direction out of the 7-11
[01:20:35] turning and walking another direction guys got a hoodie on he's walking away so the cop gets out
[01:20:41] he's yelling at him hey stop stop stop the guy doesn't stop finally he's he's now approaching him
[01:20:48] and he's standing in the open and this is something that I see in a lot of these videos these
[01:20:52] cops they stand in the open when if you imagine that the other guy has a gun why would you stand in
[01:20:59] the open take cover you take cover that's the first thing you do if you're even if you're trying
[01:21:06] to stop somebody or trying to yell at someone you take cover so if they turn around or have a gun
[01:21:10] you only have a small portion your body exposed and you don't get scared because you're hanging
[01:21:15] out in the open so so anyways this guy is approaching he's standing out in the open he's yelling at
[01:21:21] the guy finally the guy turns around and when the guy turns around he reaches in his jacket
[01:21:27] and boom the cop shoots him the guy falls down he kind of rolls into a curb the cop comes over
[01:21:36] as soon as the cop comes over you very quickly realize what's going on and that is that the guy
[01:21:42] head headphones on underneath his hoodie and he couldn't hear the cop yelling at him and then
[01:21:47] as the cop searches him he pulls out of his pocket his iPhone and so he was just listening to music
[01:21:53] reaching his pocket to turn it off and he got shot horrible situation so how do you
[01:22:03] inoculate yourself to that you've got to put yourself into training situations where you do
[01:22:07] have the instinct to take cover will you do have the instinct to see what people's hands are
[01:22:11] will you do have the instinct to realize that you put yourself in a better situation
[01:22:15] where if the guy does pull out a gun you have time to react to it and you can react to it
[01:22:22] from a safer distance you know as so there's a lot of things I would love to start to and I don't
[01:22:30] know how you know I don't know how I'm I don't know how to go about this but I would love to start
[01:22:35] working with police departments and some manner to get some training set up like the training we had
[01:22:41] in the sealed teams which was the training that I set up in the sealed teams was psychotic
[01:22:46] how stressful we would make it so that these guys were overwhelmed they were as explosions
[01:22:52] machine gunfire paintball sitting in them smoke everywhere screaming civilians screaming wounded
[01:23:02] actors we'd hire actors that were amputees that have blood spurting all the places it was
[01:23:06] incredibly realistic and that way when guys got into combat like one of the first time I ever
[01:23:11] got shot on I was like okay here's what's going on so I hope at some point I can I can help the
[01:23:16] military with that now in addition to that as you're trying to knock yourself to this violence
[01:23:25] and get used to this watch those YouTube videos watch those YouTube videos of street fights
[01:23:31] of stupid encounters with bars with drunk people and bouncer's with the shoot or don't shoot
[01:23:41] scenarios with cops military situations where they have helmet cams on and you can see things
[01:23:47] happening and what you want to do you want to watch those videos I knew I want to pay attention
[01:23:51] to the people to the humans and watch the reactions and watch their movements and watch their
[01:23:56] body language and watch their expressions on their faces and see and judge and predict and go
[01:24:03] to another video and hit pause and say this is what I see right here this is what I think is about
[01:24:08] to happen and educate yourself on human nature because human nature is what you're going to be
[01:24:15] dealing with and violence is a part of human nature and sometimes things go violent and sometimes they
[01:24:21] don't so how do you predict that and if you're unsure which you will be how do you protect yourself
[01:24:29] first and give yourself the maximum amount of time to make a judgment call so you don't have to rush
[01:24:39] on top of that it's awesome that you're doing Gjitsu do boxing do moitai do wrestling
[01:24:47] so you get used to getting hit so you start to see what a person's face looks like when they're
[01:24:52] about to hit you so you start to see what changes in their their their their posture makes
[01:24:59] when they're about to throw a punch those are all things that will help you Gjitsu is obviously
[01:25:05] great for the grinding physical grappling situation but a lot of times hopefully as a cop
[01:25:12] most of the time you're not in that situation you're standing at a little bit of a distance
[01:25:16] and or you're you know you've got a little bit more time to judge so fight as much as you can
[01:25:25] watch those law enforcement and military videos again see the reactions see the noise see the
[01:25:31] fear see the panic look at people's eyes judge them predict what they're going to do press
[01:25:38] pause and figure out if you were right or wrong watch horrible violence happen so that you can
[01:25:44] understand it better so that you can handle it when the time arises yeah I would um and
[01:25:51] just kind of to add on some of the stuff you're saying I would even say compete if you can
[01:25:57] because a lot of times in training you can especially if you're training every day or
[01:26:01] pretty often you can get into the mindset that I can just train casual today and if a guy taps
[01:26:07] me out which everyone says it doesn't matter that much you know so when you compete that's that's
[01:26:12] one of the significant things that I got um more that I realized when I was competing it's your
[01:26:18] your your your senses are heightened because everything matters if you get taken down it matters
[01:26:23] if you go for a submission and you don't get it it matters in in competition so you have that
[01:26:29] that mindset more so and you'll get used to that mindset and to your point I tell this guys at
[01:26:35] GJ2 when you're training for competition no matter what we do just about no matter 98% of the time
[01:26:44] I can't get two guys in training to go as hard against each other as they're going to in competition
[01:26:50] as someone when someone gets a grip of your gear in competition yeah it is 10 times stronger
[01:26:57] then it is when you're training because if you rip if I get a grab your gear collar and you go
[01:27:03] through some effort to rip it away and we're training and we'll let it go because I don't care
[01:27:07] if it happens in competition and I only have seven minutes to work and get you submitted I'm
[01:27:12] hanging on to that thing I'm gonna hang on to it hard and I'm not gonna let go and so you end up with
[01:27:17] a much much much more intense seven minutes in a competition or three minutes in a boxing
[01:27:26] sparring match or in a moitai the intensity you cannot simulate the intensity in training that
[01:27:34] you're gonna get in in competition and take that one step further when you get into a life and
[01:27:39] death struggle you're gonna have the same level of jump to the intensity that's gonna be there so
[01:27:46] that's a good point as well yeah and that kind of goes for moitai as well I'm not even necessarily
[01:27:49] saying competing moitai but moitai is a good one because you brought you get cracked in your body
[01:27:54] in your legs and you get to feel some pain and if you're not used to that okay before I even
[01:28:00] started moitai I went and you remember Terry so could you he was like hey you know we we've trained
[01:28:08] jujitsu together so I was like hey I'm training MMA today come let's spar with me my other partner
[01:28:12] doing and I was like hey I don't have any striking experiences like oh I don't care you know
[01:28:15] jujitsu so just train with me so yeah so that he punched me in the face really hard and that was
[01:28:22] you know and I was like man just how you're talking about this crash grenade before it was kind of
[01:28:27] like that just the fact that I got played didn't knock me out it didn't days meet in that way it was just
[01:28:32] the fact that dang I wasn't used to this I didn't know he was just gonna start punching me in my face
[01:28:37] you know I thought we were just gonna warm up so that's actually the main thing that made me go into
[01:28:43] moitai specifically so he used to get cracked yeah because I was like I'm not even I thought I was
[01:28:49] pretty good at jujitsu so I figured you know like I was I was solid you know but it was so what if I
[01:28:55] get into something you know outside of the gym like I cracked me in my face and I'm not used to it yeah you
[01:29:01] know so man so the what the moitai did help is when you get hit in the face it's like jujitsu
[01:29:08] someone grinding on you and they're breathing all in your nose or they're sweating all in your
[01:29:12] eye or whatever that doesn't bother you at all you barely noticed it and jujitsu doesn't matter
[01:29:17] right so the same thing with moitai when you get punched in the nose and it's bleeding and you see
[01:29:22] your own bladder whatever but if you're not used to that you that'll mess you up and if you notice
[01:29:27] back in the day like they're old UFC's or whatever guys will get cracked in the face like
[01:29:31] three four times hard and they'll be the whole tap and hold me calm you know because they're just
[01:29:34] not used to it nowadays guys were just but they won't they won't shut the other referee got a
[01:29:39] stop because they're used to it rarely does anyone tap and UFC front strikes yeah very rarely unless
[01:29:44] they're like injured even then you won't worry McDonald did no yeah so anyway so the point is
[01:29:52] so moitai situation and specific because that's where you feel the most pain like more than boxing
[01:29:58] like even even I mean you'll take brain injury for sure but it's not actual pain
[01:30:01] moitai get kicked in the leg and they teach you to hide the pain and to not let it affect you
[01:30:07] and go in the end and the ribs like body like knees to the ribs is super painful when you get used to
[01:30:13] that I think that out because like if you're in a situation street some cracks you hard in the face
[01:30:17] you know what's interesting about that though is that there are some people that can can
[01:30:25] easily or more easily take the pain of moitai or boxing like it's okay with them
[01:30:34] then then they then they can take the grind of jujitsu and some people can take the grind of jujitsu
[01:30:41] all day long but they can never take the striking pain so it's there's just some genetic or mental
[01:30:49] situations but to your point you need to be comfortable with both those situations yeah and at the
[01:30:56] very least just familiar with it oh like I said that's first punch that I took in my face
[01:31:02] and grinded it was I wasn't ready for him to just bail I mean you played a fun football too yeah
[01:31:06] I mean so you've been hit you've been knocked out before on the field. So it's kind of if I
[01:31:12] would try to remember it it was a combination of sure that physical impact but just the fact that
[01:31:18] this guy just punched him in my face right now so it's almost like dang it just punched me
[01:31:22] my face right now I thought we're gonna yeah I didn't like that but yeah after a while
[01:31:27] it doesn't man the hardest I ever got punched in the face was from Greg right in the like right
[01:31:31] between my eyes and it was like happens since he threw a real solid one as I went to kind of
[01:31:37] shoot he was kind of coming up off his knees kind of and I went to shoot like I got from off my back
[01:31:44] and then forward and shot forward and he just went boom and the the the the force of me shooting
[01:31:49] forward and went boom and I felt it in my neck is really bad but it was in a hard part yeah lucky
[01:31:55] other than K-Ode but yeah fully that was a K-O punch it just happened to be in that really hard part um
[01:32:01] but I had been through that before I trained my way before and it didn't it didn't even slow me down
[01:32:06] I remember thinking that was probably the hardest punch I ever took and it was with the MMA
[01:32:10] glove it wasn't with a big boxing glove well yeah back in the old days we used to just spark
[01:32:15] full on with just MMA gloves on a regular basis yeah stupid yeah and but don't do that folks yeah
[01:32:23] yeah don't do that that's a whole but what I'm saying is that that was you are used to it good again
[01:32:28] I was used to it it didn't slow me down if that was like the situation where I took that kind of hard hit
[01:32:34] in a you know or a cop would take that kind of hard hit and they're used to that in training
[01:32:37] whatever that's not gonna slow him down that's not gonna stun him unless it's physically stuns
[01:32:41] like it's some of the jobs yeah and that's you know even if you're trained that's that's that's
[01:32:46] gonna um that's gonna change in fact if you train too much and you get yourself hit too often you'll
[01:32:52] actually decrease your ability to withstand punishments yeah you've careful about that
[01:32:58] yeah you want to train enough that you're used to it you want to know that you can take it but
[01:33:02] then you don't want to over train at all yeah you never get better it take well no let me phrase that
[01:33:09] you get better at taking punches for a short period of time and then it goes starts to go backwards
[01:33:14] yeah you know unfortunately that's just the way the the body's built and you can see as some of the
[01:33:19] older UFC fighters get older you know there's no doubt they don't have the chin that they
[01:33:24] once had and that's when they usually you know decide to hang it up if they if they if they get
[01:33:29] the right counsel from people yeah but nowadays people are sparring a lot less and they're trying
[01:33:35] to not take all that punishment because everyone realizes that you have a you have a limited number
[01:33:42] of hits you can take to the to the head and then it starts to go backwards and it's a you know
[01:33:48] a lot of this information is coming from the the soldiers overseas the Marines overseas that have
[01:33:54] taken concussions and ID strikes and they're realizing that that is a permanent you know downgrade
[01:34:01] of their systems and they they you know so they so they that's where a lot of this information
[01:34:07] came from about football this concussions stuff and football a lot of that is coming from
[01:34:11] the the ID's that are soldiers and Marines have taken overseas and they've realized that this
[01:34:17] terminated traumatic brain injury is problematic and so we need to we need to watch out for it so
[01:34:23] yeah especially if you're being a cop and you gotta be alert yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's why
[01:34:27] and that's why like the Muay Thai that's why I personally I did because it was a lot of like
[01:34:32] clinching knees and that's if you if you've never done it you would think that being punched in the
[01:34:38] nose square and the nose real hard would be probably one of the more painful things but it wasn't
[01:34:43] compared to the ribs and the legs man so if you're kind of used to just just taking impacts and pain
[01:34:49] yeah you just you just and not to mention the physical part but just mentally like when that one
[01:34:55] that comes about you can just just keep on keeping on now yeah because you're used to it
[01:35:00] or you're not even me from a yeah inoculate inoculate yourself inoculation okay next question
[01:35:07] dockle I have three little girls and I'm really intrigued by Brazilian jujitsu what form of martial art
[01:35:16] would you put your kids in that's an easy yeah put your kids into jujitsu do it immediately
[01:35:26] we kind of covered this last podcast and that is the fact that if you if you've got a
[01:35:31] teacher gets luck don't get in a street fight don't get into a fight in the playground if someone
[01:35:35] wants to fight you run away and that's what they should do and you know later when they start to
[01:35:42] become mature enough to make real decisions that should guide them and occasionally as a man
[01:35:49] you may have to stand your ground and fight and that's understandable but as a little kid who might be
[01:35:56] getting picked on by bigger kids hey oh somebody gets in your face run away if you really think
[01:36:02] you're gonna get hurt run away so you have that self defense mechanism already what you don't have
[01:36:08] and what you are not born with is when that bully grabs you and pulls you to the ground or
[01:36:15] grabs you and holds onto you and won't let you leave that is when you need to know how to grapple
[01:36:20] and jujitsu is what teaches you how to grapple so eventually like you just said you do want your
[01:36:26] kids to spar a little bit you do want your kids to know how to throw some good combinations there right
[01:36:33] I mean they should know how to do that you know actually the other night I was working with Dean
[01:36:38] we were working with a couple people and just going he was going over some basics of defense and there
[01:36:41] are some legit basics self defense moves that people should know you know someone bear hugged you
[01:36:47] someone had blocks you now we don't think about them at the high level of jujitsu because we we welcome
[01:36:54] someone head locking us well come that stuff because we're so used to it it's we have an advantage
[01:36:59] when we get there but to a kid you get thrown into a headbock a first street fight I ever got the first
[01:37:04] guy kick all the street fight the first time I ever got to a fight was you know like four for fifth grade
[01:37:09] and this kid who was definitely way stronger than me grabbed me in a headlock was holding me on the
[01:37:16] ground and punched me in the head and I did couldn't do anything and you know it got broken up after
[01:37:21] twenty seconds by the principal but oh okay you know okay that that wasn't cool so what you want
[01:37:27] your kid because if that kid would have tried to attack me when I was standing up I could just run away
[01:37:32] from him but once he grabbed a hold of me all of a sudden I can't do anything so that's why
[01:37:36] jujitsu is the first thing you want to learn it's also as I said last time it's the most technical
[01:37:40] thing there's the most to learn it's never ending knowledge quest so you want to get on that
[01:37:49] quest as early as possible now on top of that and what's really good about jujitsu and again this
[01:37:56] is something that I've talked about before but when you talk about traditional martial arts and you
[01:38:02] imagine you know a traditional martial arts dojo where people in plain white guise are standing in a
[01:38:12] very clean and Spartan facility with samurai swords hanging on the wall and they're bowing to the
[01:38:19] sensei that implies a certain amount of knowledge will be passed and a certain amount of
[01:38:29] etiquette will be passed and the etiquette and the knowledge that we passed will be toughness
[01:38:36] and confidence and humility and as a matter of fact if you go to a traditional martial arts school
[01:38:44] and you bring your kid in there and you say I want my kid to train what will he get out of it
[01:38:49] one of the things they're going to say is he's going to learn to be confident or she's going to
[01:38:53] learn humility and they will teach them that verbally it will be a lesson it will be a
[01:39:03] book almost a book lesson on this is humility and this is confidence and hold your head high
[01:39:15] jujitsu teaches those things not theoretically but for real because in jujitsu you will get humbled
[01:39:27] you will get humbled by a person that's smaller than you by someone that's weaker than you they will
[01:39:32] submit you they will hold you down and you won't be able to do anything about it and that is
[01:39:38] humility and that is where you learn humility and jujitsu and same thing with confidence you know
[01:39:46] you will learn as you get better jujitsu that hey I know something and I know I can handle myself
[01:39:55] in bad situations so it truly teaches humility and confidence not theoretically but in a very
[01:40:06] practical sense yeah so get your kids down to the jujitsu school get them enrolled and you know we
[01:40:15] we did a podcast where we talked about how to find a good jujitsu school so find a good reputable place
[01:40:20] and get your kids down there and you know what when you bring your kids in to start jujitsu get your
[01:40:25] dang self on the mat too because you gotta know it and it's everybody should know it yeah and
[01:40:31] except for bullies and evil people they should be banned do jujitsu because it's too powerful yeah yeah
[01:40:37] way too much another element that you might not think of right off the bat but the fact that you'll
[01:40:46] meet friends because jujitsu for whatever reason I mean it just might be the culture in general but
[01:40:53] when you go to like the jujitsu mat you go on the mat it's not like how you're saying like a traditional
[01:40:58] martial arts school where you're like don't talk bow be rigid stand like this while the
[01:41:03] senses talking say yes or no sir it's it's really I mean in my experience that I've been to a
[01:41:07] lot especially here in in Southern California there that's where most of them are um it's real
[01:41:12] even though the more rigid ones are casual before class you can talk even during class as long as
[01:41:18] you're not talking while the instructors yeah do you want to do that in a school you wouldn't
[01:41:22] do that anywhere yeah exactly you know but you know your practicing moves it's it's um of course
[01:41:28] he don't want to deviate too much from the lesson but it's just more social and so you talk after
[01:41:33] class and you'll find that that the atmosphere is really conducive to gravitating towards people
[01:41:40] that that have the same interests of you even outside of jujitsu and kids especially men because
[01:41:46] usually the teachers are way more lenient with kids when they're running around and you know you
[01:41:50] you're telling them go do this move and they might be talking a little bit about something or
[01:41:54] whatever if they're having fun which it is very fun um they're just gonna want to do it some more
[01:42:00] my daughter's two and we found a place that that could facilitate a two-year-old situation and
[01:42:05] she would always look forward to because the issues think it's just one big display house the
[01:42:09] rough housing the whole time it's the ultimate dream for a kid yeah a room with padded floors and
[01:42:14] padded walls yeah you can grab the clothes rough house all you want yeah people to the ground yeah
[01:42:19] you're not gonna get punched or cake or you know yeah it's um yeah so there is a
[01:42:26] good community aspect to jujitsu yeah it's very much so which echo likes very much so
[01:42:34] sometimes I don't even want to roll I just want to come and talk sometimes that's often the
[01:42:42] situation with that jujitsu juggle willing so basically being a new leader overcoming friction
[01:42:52] in the new organization that's this that's what this guy is he's there you know he's a new leader
[01:42:58] overcoming friction in the organization and penetrating insights yes and I think what's important here is
[01:43:03] this is he's not a new leader like newly commissioned leader stepping up in the ranks he's in a new
[01:43:08] organization so he's stepping into a new organization is the new leader in a new situation
[01:43:15] we've kind of talked about stepping up from within the organization how are you going and stepping
[01:43:21] into a new organization now I'm gonna look at this from a perspective of like a normal transition
[01:43:28] into a leadership position and a new job or something like that not a hostile takeover situation
[01:43:34] maybe we can address that on a later time but not a situation where hey they fired this guy
[01:43:41] he had a bad reputation the things are going wrong you're gonna step in and change it because that
[01:43:47] that would take a different leadership approach then the one that I that I would take and that I
[01:43:53] have taken where you're stepping into a situation where things are going okay and you put your
[01:43:58] coming in and you've got some goals and there's so you're taking over leadership position it happens
[01:44:02] all the time so a couple of things about this first of all you stepping to a new leadership role
[01:44:11] you gotta talk to people but you mostly gotta listen you gotta find out why they're doing
[01:44:19] things the way they are because a lot of times there might be reasons for the way things are
[01:44:23] happening that you don't understand or that aren't really particularly evident so you really want
[01:44:28] to not make the judgments because you're bringing your own experience and you've done this a
[01:44:33] thousand times and that's why you're the new leader and that's why they put you in here you
[01:44:36] got to set that aside and say okay explain me why this process is in place or where did this process
[01:44:43] come from what is this process trying to prevent so that way you're getting smarter and you're learning
[01:44:48] and you're not being you're not imposing your ideas which you don't have any background for you
[01:44:56] don't you know you may have been a leadership in a different company or a different unit before
[01:45:02] and you think you know but you don't know so be humble and check yourself you gotta be friendly
[01:45:09] to people but at the same time you gotta be reserved now this is this is tricky because
[01:45:15] you are trying to build relationships you absolutely are trying to build relationships that's what
[01:45:21] life is that's what business is that's what war is that's what everything is about building
[01:45:26] relationships with these other humans so you want to be friendly to people but at the same time
[01:45:32] from a leadership perspective you can't just come in and be Mr. Nice guy and best friends with
[01:45:38] everybody that's not gonna work out for you for a couple reasons number one you don't know
[01:45:47] the the face that people are gonna present you out of the gate is not necessarily
[01:45:55] the true face of that person so you may check in your first day and this guy hey it's great to meet
[01:46:00] you so good to have you on board heard a lot about you and you go wow this guy's and he's
[01:46:04] ticked starts giving you some back-own information about things that are going and by the way we got
[01:46:07] a couple things that are a little messed up you know and I can point them out to you but that guy
[01:46:11] might be working as a gender so you gotta be cautious as you go in and the other piece of that is
[01:46:20] it is much easier to reel back in slack or sorry it's much easier to give out that friendship
[01:46:27] later then it is if you go overboard and you become everyone's best friend and now you got to
[01:46:31] cut it off yeah that was done you become a jerk yeah so it's much easier to to
[01:46:38] give out the slack when you want to later then it is to give out a bunch of slack and then try and
[01:46:43] reel it back in and be a jerk yeah and it makes it hard for both parties that's why in
[01:46:48] that case yeah but it's gonna be really hard the only reason you're pulling back the friendship
[01:46:53] thing is because it started going sideways and that makes it even harder it's a nightmare
[01:46:58] uh gotta watch out for the gossip because everyone's gonna want to whisper in your hair the
[01:47:05] things about the things about the people and this and that so you gotta be careful nod your head
[01:47:09] take it and but unbored but take it with a great assault definitely don't encourage it
[01:47:16] yeah and that can be a hard part for certain types of people will say because let's face him and
[01:47:22] that can be some interesting stuff yeah and there can be some knowledge to be gained there but you
[01:47:26] just have to be careful you want to hear some insights right but be careful when the insights
[01:47:33] crossover into gossip yeah and be careful that the insights are coming from people that might have
[01:47:38] agendas in fact they are coming from people that have agendas because everybody has agendas
[01:47:44] and maybe the person has a positive agenda which is to improve the company or improve the unit or
[01:47:49] improve the team but they also might have a agenda of improving their own station in life so you
[01:47:56] have to be careful of that they are watching you they are watching you and you coming to take over
[01:48:04] they are watching you so act accordingly think about the fact that they are watching you
[01:48:11] like I said use caution informing these new relationships you gotta find out who's who you want to
[01:48:20] establish things but again you gotta watch out because people might not necessarily be who they
[01:48:29] make themselves out to be in the beginning so this is kind of becoming a little bit of a chorus
[01:48:36] when I talk about leading be humble listen learn move methodically when it does come time to
[01:48:44] make change in a new situation most of the time I would say do it incrementally do smaller changes
[01:48:55] after you've assessed fully and you've got people a people's opinions and you've expressed
[01:49:01] and socialized your ideas so you're not trying to roll in there and change the world again now
[01:49:07] if we go into a hostile turnover situation or there's someone's been fired for cause or that's a
[01:49:12] different situation but for a normal transition into a new job be humble listen learn and lead that part
[01:49:19] where you're you're talking about playing out why they're doing the things that the way they are and
[01:49:24] stuff like that that part can be depending on certain people's personality like if you're coming in
[01:49:33] as the new guy and you and you ask start asking hey why do you guys do it like this if you come off
[01:49:38] with the wrong tone sometimes it'll sound like that you're questioning oh for sure you know so
[01:49:42] sure I remember when I worked at the nightclub we had a new manager and his name was Joel he
[01:49:49] he came in and he was strangely he was this whole list personified he came in is really friendly
[01:49:57] but really reserved but the one thing he did kind of to address what I was talking about right
[01:50:02] really good job he except as no no okay nothing I'm saying an example of how he
[01:50:09] clarified that he's not questioning the way we're doing stuff he's not saying hey where are you doing it like that
[01:50:14] because this way sucks it didn't have that tone but he came for me and I saw him do it to the other guy
[01:50:21] where he he came in and said hey I'm I'm gonna be asking a lot of questions because obviously I'm new here
[01:50:26] you know just so I can understand and and get on board with what you're doing so it can be ultimately
[01:50:32] what we are doing that's what he said he said in a little bit differently obviously but
[01:50:38] that's what he said and that right away so no matter what question he asked it was almost like
[01:50:41] should I want to tell this guy how it's working you know because he's he's he's he's on my team
[01:50:45] automatically told me that and he was on my team so I think if that can be clarified that you're not
[01:50:50] like questioning it because it seems like you know I want to make it seem like you know I know
[01:50:56] a better way right off the bat you don't want that tone you know I know just from on a receiving end
[01:51:01] I don't want that to know because I'm gonna be on yeah so anyway yes yes yes in the last thing I kind of
[01:51:07] had written down here was enjoy it it's it's it's awesome stepping into a new leadership position
[01:51:16] and it's challenging to do what you just talked about to transition people into your leadership
[01:51:22] realm and to do it in a subtle way that brings them on board with a positive attitude so
[01:51:30] enjoy that challenge yeah because it's it's pretty fun it's challenging and most importantly
[01:51:35] it's rewarding yeah next question juggle how do you learn slash practice detachment in real time
[01:51:48] detachment so I this is something that I have talked about a lot and
[01:51:55] it is definitely a very important part of leadership and it's a very important part of
[01:52:07] of finding your way successfully through life it's an important part of navigation
[01:52:14] of the world so and if you haven't heard me talk about this this is the idea that you are not
[01:52:22] caught up in the emotions and the chaos and the and the tactical fire fight that's happening
[01:52:30] you detach so you can make good judgments about things so how do you do it how do you learn it
[01:52:37] now do you practice it step number one is awareness awareness of yourself so you start asking yourself
[01:52:49] how am I being perceived right now if you can just occasionally start asking yourself how am I being
[01:52:57] perceived right now how is echo singing me right now so all the sudden you you start to take other
[01:53:05] people's perspective which is it's a good start because it's not your own and the goal is to
[01:53:14] get outside of your own perspective and see yourself from some kind of a distance so you start
[01:53:19] asking yourself how am I being perceived and then start trying to watch yourself like what do I look
[01:53:25] like right now am I caught inside that madness and once you start to do that that's going to be like
[01:53:35] your that's going to be your little tool that you're going to use is getting outside and just
[01:53:40] watch yourself and saying okay I am aware of what I'm doing right now I am aware of what I am doing
[01:53:47] right now and then what you want to do is you want to set some kind of alerts because you don't
[01:53:55] walk around and walk around detached from myself all the time I'm not I mean otherwise you would have
[01:54:00] no joy and you would have no you'd have no pain you'd have no emotions because you'd be detached from
[01:54:05] so you don't walk I don't walk around just detached all the time but I do have some alerts some
[01:54:13] little red flags and little triggers that happened in my mind that when I feel them I know okay
[01:54:22] you're starting to go too far and you're losing the perception of yourself
[01:54:29] what's your trigger there a couple of them number one is like some strong emotion yeah like
[01:54:38] anger yeah yeah you know anger you start feeling sorry if you start clenching your fist or you
[01:54:43] start raising your voice that should be a warning okay you are not thinking clearly right now
[01:54:48] detached from this get away from these emotions some kind of chaos like chaos happening
[01:54:56] and you're in it whether it's in a supermarket whether it's you know something bad something
[01:55:02] violent something mob if you're getting in that situation you start feeling that
[01:55:07] detach yourself from it because you can get caught up and it's any overwhelming excitement
[01:55:13] will be it now here's a good red flag here's a good red flag good alert
[01:55:19] is the 27th time you bang your head against the wall attacking a problem whatever that problem is
[01:55:28] you know and I actually made this joke the other day of your jiu jiu jiu because we're talking
[01:55:32] about passing someone's guard and people will try and try and try one way one way one way one two three four five
[01:55:38] and I'm like listen after your 27th attempt to pass someone's guard the same way
[01:55:43] go ahead and try another way so this happens a lot where if you find yourself beating your head
[01:55:50] against the wall after the 27th time go ahead and let that be a little alert that you need to
[01:55:57] detach you need to get because there's some reason that you're doing this maybe it's an emotional
[01:56:01] reason maybe it's just your two close to the problem maybe it's that the problem has a
[01:56:07] hold of you and you don't recognize it but let that be in alert a trigger that tells you hey buddy
[01:56:15] detach take a look around and see if there's another way now another huge thing that requires
[01:56:27] detachment is your ego your big nasty powerful ego it's one of the biggest things that you
[01:56:40] have to utilize detachment to overcome and let me tell you some of the things that will warn you
[01:56:48] that your ego is now in the game and when your ego is in the game when your ego is in the game
[01:56:54] it will very easily win it will beat you so when you're feeling jealousy likely that's going to
[01:57:05] be your ego and actually heard somebody on Twitter hit me with this the other day and it was
[01:57:10] something along the lines of if you're feeling jealous instead of saying I'm jealous of this person
[01:57:20] say what can I learn from this person wow great statement right because that's when you set your
[01:57:27] ego that's when you detach from your ego and you say okay I'm not going to be jealous of this person
[01:57:33] they can teach me something when you start feeling frustrated when you start feeling disgust or anger
[01:57:39] where is that emotion coming from very high likelihood it's coming from your ego so you need to
[01:57:48] put that ego into check do you think that's the hardest one do you think oh yeah although
[01:58:01] they can all be pretty hard I mean because you know when you get emotional about a relationship
[01:58:08] yeah I mean that's not always your ego that can be your ego especially if there's another person involved
[01:58:13] right but a lot of times that's not your ego that's that's your emotion that's hurting
[01:58:18] and causing problems but yeah the ego I actually find the ego because it's so clear it's so
[01:58:27] clear that you're just being an idiot with your ego I always go God I'm stupid why am I doing this
[01:58:37] and I think it is usually pretty I think the ones that are harder a little bit a little bit more
[01:58:41] subtle you know yeah yeah and that's kind of what I mean because the ego is like that's how powerful it
[01:58:47] is because any extreme situation or extreme example of any one of these like you can feel it really
[01:58:55] angry it's easy to see I lost my temper right there I'm just an ad on that shouldn't it yelled at
[01:59:00] you know whatever or if your ego's prevalent in this really just to end it real strong way it's
[01:59:08] obvious and of course not but the ego I feel like it's like that subtlety of it makes it hard
[01:59:14] because you know that last part of it's like if you want to remove your ego it's almost like a
[01:59:19] bucket of sand where you gotta get the last corner of your ego out for it to work otherwise
[01:59:24] your ego still in the game no you know it was always in the game and and I don't encourage people
[01:59:29] to I'm not like the boot of it says completely a limited your ego because your ego is what's
[01:59:33] driving you in many cases to perform well to win there's nothing wrong with that you know and if
[01:59:38] you but the part of the end of in the end of what's that book anyways just like ego is this
[01:59:49] God bless the ego you know this and it's pretty powerful because that's what drives you that's the
[01:59:55] individual effort the problem is there's a dichotomy of everything and sometimes your ego will
[02:00:03] get the best of you and that's what you need to watch out for and that's when you get a learn to
[02:00:06] attach from it yeah so it's like each situation you have a certain sized cup that can only hold
[02:00:13] so much ego to get it done and then any even one drop it's gonna jam you up if it's one
[02:00:19] if you're one drop overflowing you know and you could make bad decisions with your ego yeah
[02:00:23] if you let it get in the way yeah and that's the hard thing because and I think that's probably
[02:00:27] the reason because you need your ego to kind of function and get test done and excel and all this
[02:00:34] stuff so you have to basically find that fine line that you have to get rid of you know the
[02:00:40] the at that what point do you get rid of enough ego to still have enough ego to get the test done you
[02:00:47] know so the dichotomy yeah sometimes you're gonna be like yeah not that I ever have that problem
[02:00:53] nothing like that you're just saying it it's seen like you know or that problem unfortunately
[02:00:58] okay juggle what do you think of people in leadership rules who cuss I see it in coaching
[02:01:10] guys either totally use it or totally against it so swearing
[02:01:18] and crossing using foul language I think this is a pretty straightforward question I can tell you
[02:01:28] that by no means am i a saint and and you know I was in those seal teams for 20 years
[02:01:39] and when you've heard the term swear like a sailor there's actually a level beyond that
[02:01:44] and that's swearing like a seal and so I you know there's times in the seal teams where
[02:01:50] literally you know every single word in a sentence would be you know a swear word
[02:02:00] and and that's something that when I go back and brief the tea brief the seal teams right now
[02:02:05] on something I go almost right back into that mode you know not not quite as bad as I would
[02:02:12] probably was at the high point of my career where I was well rehearsed and well trained at
[02:02:21] foul language but uh but hey here's the deal on a forum like this where we're on a podcast where
[02:02:26] you know many many people listen to this including kids and my kids and um I try and utilize
[02:02:38] better language now and I'll tell you what I actually had a point where I sort of said to myself
[02:02:45] me I'm not gonna do that and I heard a podcast but you're not gonna do what I'm not gonna swear
[02:02:50] a lot I'm not gonna be in I'm not just gonna swear the whole time in the podcast and this
[02:02:54] actually happened because I heard a podcast I listened to a podcast where it was actually it was
[02:03:00] a conversation you know normal podcast there was a conversation going on between two people and
[02:03:05] there were swearing so much that I just said to myself man this sounds ridiculous they just
[02:03:14] sounded it sounded completely ridiculous and I just decided after and this was before we started
[02:03:21] up I this was you know maybe like two years ago I mean it was a long time ago I heard this podcast
[02:03:25] I just said to myself and these people sound stupid with so much swearing and um and it wasn't
[02:03:32] the thing is like you listen to Joe Rogan or like a comedic podcast and they're swearing and
[02:03:37] and some people like friends and Joe Rogan he swears he does it at the right time and it has
[02:03:44] comedic impact or it has value when he does it so so that's understandable but I've heard people
[02:03:50] that they just it's it's just it doesn't it ends up having no impact other than just to make you
[02:03:57] say this person's not very smart right so with that you know I just try to keep it clean
[02:04:04] actually it's not even almost like I don't consciously sit there and try and keep it clean but
[02:04:10] you know I try and keep it clean yeah is that kind of like you know people most of us have this
[02:04:17] I don't say problem but we always say like like you know like very similar like how it just did
[02:04:22] yes and I'm doing that it's still kind of like that yeah it is it's the same thing where when you
[02:04:27] hear someone saying like like like it's soon as you you might not even recognize it at first
[02:04:36] because we're so used to hearing it yeah but if you pick up on it and you're listening to a podcast
[02:04:41] and you start to hear someone do that it's the same thing you just say wow this person really sounds
[02:04:48] stupid and they might be smart but this person sounds really stupid and I'm not gonna sound like that
[02:04:58] so that's pretty much where where my opinion comes from and why and if you know when I have
[02:05:05] had a couple people hit me up and say you know hey this is the only podcast that I listen to that my
[02:05:10] kids can listen to yeah and that's that's kind of cool you know I appreciate that it's it's pretty
[02:05:15] it's pretty humbling to hear that people are you know sitting there listening to podcasts with
[02:05:22] their kids yeah and I guess humbling is the wrong word which somebody hit me up on Twitter it's an
[02:05:28] honor right and it's an honor that doesn't feel like I deserve but it's an honor here somebody's
[02:05:35] sitting around and say oh you know I listen to this podcast with my daughter or I listen to your
[02:05:38] podcast with my son and it's so many good lessons to learn and that that feels pretty good yeah
[02:05:42] yeah and so if I was to throw that out the window so that I could drop some F-bombs yeah
[02:05:49] doesn't really seem worth it because what kind of a linguistic command do I have if the only
[02:05:56] way I can get my point across is by is by using foul language you know if the funny thing is too is
[02:06:05] well I used to go you know when I was in the SEAL teams I would go and literally like I said
[02:06:11] my I would have whole sentence construction that would be nothing but F-bombs right and I would
[02:06:18] come home and in front of my six six year old kid or whatever I never sworn in front of my kids
[02:06:25] and people would be kind of surprised like if I had a seal buddy over and they'd hear me talk
[02:06:31] in my house and they'd say how do you even do that how do you and I don't know why I've just been
[02:06:35] able to do it so that was another thing you know these podcasts when you go on the interwebs
[02:06:41] they're there for I hate to say it but they're there forever you know and you can take them down
[02:06:48] but these are going to be these are out there so if you if you want to be represented that way
[02:06:55] for the rest of your life then you had to be a little bit careful about what you're saying
[02:07:02] yeah yeah that's um because I kind of like it's not like too swear but I like when
[02:07:11] people swear and stuff I think it's but just like how you were saying like for example Joe Rogan like
[02:07:15] he'll swear and sometimes it'll swear a lot but it's perfect isn't it's funny when it needs to be
[02:07:19] funny it emphasizes you know a certain emotion when it needs it's it's perfect and that's kind of
[02:07:25] the reason why I like it because sometimes it can be really funny it can be fun to do but overall
[02:07:31] there's a certain kind of you can't help but kind of respect someone who doesn't like
[02:07:36] use the word like all the time or that doesn't say um all the time or who doesn't say you know
[02:07:42] all the time or no I'm saying or whatever and and can can control that and I think swearing is yet
[02:07:48] another one of those things that some people it's more of a weakness where they kind of they don't
[02:07:53] don't know how to use it right they just swear because they swear and you know my parents were
[02:07:56] so I swear who cares kind of thing and on top of that you do have to consider who you're talking to
[02:08:03] and in a podcast situation you're essentially talking to everybody regardless of the
[02:08:06] you you're trying to talk to who you think or want your audience to be it's everyone and anyone who
[02:08:11] presses the button is going to be listening so if you don't care how you come off then good didn't that's
[02:08:16] that's great but I think you do have more of a control on how you come off when you can control
[02:08:22] how much you swear it don't swear well I haven't had anybody you know hit me up on Twitter and say
[02:08:27] hey you really need to swear on mom right it doesn't happen didn't know one said hey you need to say
[02:08:32] um or or you need to say like more people don't need to hear that they accept it because
[02:08:39] it's there and I'll tell you a funny the first time I took my just to take my son out occasionally
[02:08:44] to various seal training sites you know in order to unoccupate him to violence and fire arms
[02:08:53] and machine guns and war and and yes you people can all call child services on me
[02:09:00] but it was funny the first time you know he watched a single-polled tune do some event
[02:09:09] and I think he was at a out of urban training facility and they got done and I was debriefing
[02:09:15] them and you know this is my son who had never heard me swear and you kind of used at that age where
[02:09:22] you know a swear word was like it was worse than ever and he you know he was standing there and I debriefed these
[02:09:29] guys and I debriefed them in the proper seal technique and I got done he had a look at his face
[02:09:38] that said wow this guy is a little bit different than what I knew it was pretty shocked and it was
[02:09:47] uh it was a pretty funny scenario so you know he say you don't swear in front of your kids um
[02:09:51] um why is that because you don't want them to swear or or yeah I mean there is you know if
[02:09:59] you ever see a and and I do now that my daughters are a little older I'll drop some swear words
[02:10:06] and I'm in occasionally for impact or for humor you know or for whatever so so I will do it but
[02:10:14] if you ever see a young girl swearing you see a young boy you know it very much seems
[02:10:26] disrespectful in my opinion so I don't want my kids to be running around with a foul mouth
[02:10:36] now I took my son and a couple of his buddies went a little surf trip and they were sleeping in a
[02:10:41] tent outside of and I was in the I was in the camper and I woke up at when I normally wake up and
[02:10:50] they were what they were up early to go surfing as well but I was standing outside their tent and I was
[02:10:54] pretty impressed with you. Oh you're the wife you're ready a foul language that they produced.
[02:10:59] Yeah yeah and that's kind of a thing too right so it doesn't if you'd never swear to your kids it's
[02:11:05] not like you have protected them for swearing so that's that's my point is that after I stood
[02:11:11] out there for a while and I listened to them and then I said something along the lines of
[02:11:15] hey are you guys done and are you ready to surfing and my son says how long have you been out there
[02:11:21] dad and and I swore back at him I swore back at him and said I've been out here long and then
[02:11:29] they kind of remain quiet for a second and then they started laughing I said all right boys let's go so
[02:11:34] I'm not a goodie to choose I understand and you know we talked about Pat and Patton swore.
[02:11:42] Incessantly amongst the troops and then when he'd get in front of the politicians he would not and I guess
[02:11:48] I would hope to behave that way and I just got too I used to go there was when we got back
[02:11:54] for a money I had to go and brief the secretary of the navy I had to go brief the congrent
[02:11:59] joint caucus I mean I had to go and brief some high level governmental officials and whatnot
[02:12:04] and I was just walking there or not obviously you're not going to swear for them so I think that's another
[02:12:10] another situation where you've got to know and understand when to swear and when not to swear and
[02:12:18] I just hopefully I'm making the right decisions and like I said no one has no one has
[02:12:25] hit me up and said you really need to use more foul language and you know there's times where we've you know
[02:12:31] we've used foul language on the podcast because hey it's a reality it's a reality of
[02:12:38] Vietnam it's a reality of all wars yeah so to exclude it like it doesn't exist is not what I'm trying to do here
[02:12:47] Yeah and that's kind of a big in my opinion a big deal when someone you can tell they're
[02:12:53] they're actively pursuing not swearing where in any kind of especially in a casual conversation where
[02:13:00] they're about to say something and then they then they use like I don't know sugar I don't know
[02:13:07] you know those reap obvious replays and which is it's nothing wrong with it but it does kind of
[02:13:12] kind of make you think oh wait like we so we can't just be ourselves right now like we I don't know
[02:13:16] it feels like you may feel free to relate to it yeah you know what's interesting is you see
[02:13:21] full metal jacket and just an amazing movie about the Marine Corps and the whole the whole first 45 minutes is boot camp
[02:13:31] and it's played by Lee Raymy I think is his name and he does he was a real general instructor and so he just
[02:13:37] nails it and I remember when my son was six or seven years old I thought to myself I'll play him some of
[02:13:42] this movie I'll just find some parts that don't have any foul language there are no parts well
[02:13:47] everything is just completely over the top and it's awesome so so there's definitely a time in a
[02:13:57] place where the other thing is for me honestly it's you know I was I'm always trying to do better
[02:14:04] it stuff there's a challenge be in trying to find words that are gonna have impact without just
[02:14:13] going right to the easy button on the on the big f-bomb because that's gonna have impact but
[02:14:19] if that's what you need to use then that's just a little easy out that I want to take every single
[02:14:24] time and presents itself yeah I'll tell you when I get when there's been a couple times with my
[02:14:29] kids where they've stepped over line there's something out of line and when I when I've sworn at them
[02:14:36] it was like I slapped him in the face because it was having that much impact when I was just
[02:14:41] thrown around all the time it's taken away the impact right right yeah so strategically it's
[02:14:45] a secret yeah patting apparently was from what I read he he when he'd get people fired up he
[02:14:52] do that on purpose oh and then like even just in normal conversation he didn't really swear that
[02:14:56] much this one thing so he used it as a specific tool you know to get certain things done
[02:15:00] it's for as influence goes yeah I can't believe we've talked for 10 minutes about swearing right
[02:15:06] it needed to be talked about anyway that's the question I think we got time for one more
[02:15:13] okay last question juggle what techniques do you use to deal with situational stress from battlefield
[02:15:22] to boardroom well first of all and I don't mean to minimize the stress that people face but
[02:15:30] imagine imagine what Eugene sledge that we talked about tonight imagine what he went through on
[02:15:38] pellelu in the tens of thousands of marines that suffered debt unimaginable horror
[02:15:50] and then you imagine hackworth who he talked about here who wrote about face assaulting enemy
[02:15:56] positions in korean he was wounded over and over again on the line and still went back for more
[02:16:05] and he got Alan Seeger the poet who in World War I went over the top over and over again
[02:16:17] to make his rendezvous with death and there's been thousands and hundreds of thousands of millions
[02:16:28] of warriors that have been in very stressful situations and faced evil and faced death
[02:16:38] much worse than the situation I'm in or urine that we might consider stressful and
[02:16:47] I even did this when I was overseas when I was on deployment when I was a combat leader
[02:16:53] I was feeling stress and you know what we took casualties and it was awful and it was heartbreaking
[02:17:05] but there were other soldiers and warriors throughout time that had been in much worse situations
[02:17:13] getty's burger, vix burger, the battle the bulge and in all those horrible situations
[02:17:26] they prove really that humans can withstand almost unimaginable stress
[02:17:33] which meant to me that I could too and you can and the first step for me is doing that taking that
[02:17:48] look to gain some perspective and then in order to gain perspective you got to do something
[02:17:56] that we already talked about you got to detach you've got to detach from the problems or the
[02:18:01] stress that you're experiencing so that you can get that perspective of them
[02:18:09] now there's a couple different types of stress now if it's something that you can control
[02:18:18] that's causing you stress well why aren't you getting control of it generally it's a lack of
[02:18:25] discipline so you've got to have the discipline to grab control and make it happen and when I say
[02:18:32] you need discipline for that what that means is these stresses that you're avoiding they're not
[02:18:40] going to go away if you avoid them so take the discipline to face the stressful situation get ahead of
[02:18:47] it don't be afraid of it now there's also stress that's caused by things that you cannot
[02:18:55] control and if you remember talking earlier about artillery and how horrible that was and what made
[02:19:04] it so horrible was that there's no control over so if you can't control something and you can't get
[02:19:12] control of it you have to at least embrace what you can and I'm not saying you're going to embrace
[02:19:22] artillery showing but I'll tell you what when it comes to things like artillery or for us in
[02:19:29] Ramadi was IEDs and we could do everything we could do to mitigate that risk but eventually
[02:19:36] there's only so much you can do and you cannot completely eliminate it but you can't control it so
[02:19:43] why you're going to worry about it why you're going to stress about it if there's something that's
[02:19:49] completely beyond your control you cannot you've got to detach from it and not let yourself
[02:19:55] get stressed about it and on top of that if it's something that you can't control how can you
[02:20:04] look at it in a different light how can you see it in a way that you could actually take advantage of it
[02:20:09] how can you take that stress and make it into some kind of ally you know the chaos of combat
[02:20:23] is something that I couldn't control but I had to embrace it so I could try and figure out how to
[02:20:27] take advantage of it so when it comes to stress don't fight it turn it on itself and you
[02:20:39] use it use it to make yourself sharper and more alert and use it to make yourself think more
[02:20:48] and learn more and get better and use that stress as a catalyst to make yourself better
[02:20:58] and I think that's all we've got for tonight so thanks to everybody for tuning in and listening to us
